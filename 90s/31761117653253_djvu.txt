Smart Communities 


What is it? 

Canada is a world leader in 
telecommunications technology and 
information accessibility. Yet Canada also 
needs to develop and showcase how 
information and communications 
technologies can provide services and 
applications that improve the economic, 
social and cultural well-being of Canadian 
communities. 


Who's Involved? 

In order to help accelerate the benefits that 
Canadians can realize from information 
technologies, the Government of Canada 
created a blue ribbon panel of experts to 
advise on how Canada can take a leading 
role in developing “smart communities.” 
Upon the panel’s recommendations, the 
government has committed to establishing a 
Smart Community Demonstration Project in 
each province, the North and an Aboriginal 
community by the year 2000. 


The federal government envisions Smart 
Communities as communities that use 
information technology in new and 
innovative ways to empower their residents, 
institutions and region as a whole. Smart 
Communities make the most of the 
opportunities that new technologies 

afford — for better health care delivery, for 
better education and training, and for 
growing businesses. 


How Does it Work? 


Smart Communities have the potential to: 


2 help people harness the power of 
information and communications tech- 
nologies and thereby develop the skills 
needed to prosper in the knowledge- 
based economy, improve their quality 
of life and strengthen their culture
