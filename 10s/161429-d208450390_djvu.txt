SEE  ATTACHED  ADDENDUM  FOR  ADDITIONAL  PROVISIONS 

This  is  a  non-developmental  Oil  &  Gas  Lease,  whereby  Lessee,  its  successors  or  assigns,  shall  not  conduct  any 
operations,  as  defined  herein,  on  the  surface  of  said  lands.  However,  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  to  pool  or  unitize  said  lands, 
or  part  thereof,  with  other  lands  to  comprise  an  oil  and/or  gas  development  unit. 

This  lease  also  covers  and  includes,  in  addition  to  that  above  described,  all  land,  if  any,  contiguous  or  adjacent  to  or  adjoining  the  land  above 
described  and  (a)  owned  or  claimed  by  Lessor  by  limitation,  prescription,  possession,  reversion,  after-acquired  title  or  unrecorded  instrument  or 
(b)  as  to  which  Lessor  has  a  preference  right  of  acquisition.  Lessor  agrees  to  execute  any  supplemental  instrument  requested  by  Lessee  for  a 
more  complete  or  accurate  description  of  said  land.  For  the  purpose  of  determining  the  amount  of  any  bonus  or  other  payment  hereunder,  said  land 
shall  be  deemed  to  contain  0.460  acres,  whether  actually  containing  more  or  less,  and  the  above  recital  of  acreage  in  any  tract  shall  be  deemed  to 
be  the  true  acreage  thereof.  Lessor  accepts  the  bonus  as  lump  sum  consideration  for  this  lease  and  all  rights  and  options  hereunder. 


2.  Unless  sooner  terminated  or  longer  kept  in  force  under  other  provisions  hereof,  this  lease  shall  remain  in  force  for  a  term  of 
3     years  from  the  date  hereof,  hereinafter  called  ''primary  term,"  and  as  long  thereafter  as  operations,  as  hereinafter  defined,  are  conducted 
upon  said  land  with  no  cessation  for  more  than  ninety  (90)  consecutive  days. 


3.  As  royalty,  Lessee  covenants  and  agrees:  (a)  To  deliver  to  the  credit  of  Lessor,  in  the  pipe  line  to  which  Lessee  may  connect  its  wells,  the  equal 
1/4  part  of  all  oil  produced  and  saved  by  Lessee  from  said  land,  or  from  time  to  time,  at  the  option  of  Lessee,  to  pay  Lessor  the  average 
posted  market  price  of  such  1/4  part  of  such  oil  at  the  wells  as  of  the  day  it  is  run  to  the  pipe  line  or  storage  tanks,  Lessor's  interest,  in  either  case, 
to  bear  1/4  of  the  cost  of  treating  oil  to  render  it  marketable  pipe  line  oil;  (b)  To  pay  Lessor  on  gas  and  casinghead  gas  produced  from  said  land 
(1 )  when  sold  by  Lessee.  1/4  of  the  amount  realized  by  Lessee,  computed  at  the  mouth  of  the  well,  or  (2)  when  used  by  Lessee  off  said  land  or  in 
the  manufacture  of  gasofineor  other  products,  the  market  value,  at  the  mouth  of  the  well,  of  1/4  of  such  gas  and  casinghead  gas;  (c)  To  pay 
Lessor  on  all  other  minerals  mined  and  marketed  or  utilized  by  Lessee  from  said  land,  one-tenth  either  in  kind  or  value  at  the  well  or  mine  at  Lessee's 
election,  except  that  on  sulphur  mined  and  marketed  the  royalty  shall  be  one  dollar  ($1 .00)  per  long  ton.  If,  at  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  or 
at  any  time  or  times  thereafter,  there  is  any  well  on  said  land  or  on  lands  with  which  said  land  or  any  portion  thereof  has  been  pooled,  capable 
of  producing  oil  or  gas,  and  all  such  wells  are  shut-in,  this  lease  shall,  nevertheless,  continue  in  force  as  though  operations  were  being 
conducted  on  said  land  for  so  long  as  said  wells  are  shut-in,  and  thereafter  this  lease  may  be  continued  in  force  as  IT  no  shut-in  had  occurred. 
Lessee  covenants  and  agrees  to  use  reasonable  diligence  to  produce,  utilize,  or  market  the  minerals  capable  of  being  produced  from  said  wells, 
but  in  the  exercise  of  such  diligence,  Lessee  shall  not  be  obligated  to  install  or  furnish  facilities  other  than  well  facilities  and  ordinary  lease  facilities  of 
flow  lines,  separator,  and  lease  tank,  and  shall  not  be  required  to  settle  labor  trouble  or  to  market  gas  upon  terms  unacceptable  to  Lessee.  If,  at 
any  time  or  times  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term ,  all  such  wells  are  shut-in  for  a  period  of  ninety  consecutive  days,  and  during  such  time 
there  are  no  operations  on  said  land,  then  at  or  before  the  expiration  of  said  ninety  day  period,  Lessee  shall  pay  or  tender,  by  check  or  draft  of 
Lessee,  as  royalty,  a  sum  equal  to  one  dollar  ($1 .00)  for  each  acre  of  land  then  covered  hereby.  Lessee  shall  make  like  payments  or  tenders  at  or 
before  the  end  of each  anniversary  of  the  expiration  of  said  ninety  day  period  if  upon  such  anniversary  this  lease  is  being  continued  in  force  solely 
by  reason  of  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph.  Each  such  payment  or  tender  shall  be  made  to  the  parties  who  at  the  time  of  payment  would  be 
entitled  to  receive  the  royalties  which  would  be  paid  under  this  lease  if  the  wells  were  producing,  and  may  be  deposited  in  such  bank  as  directed 
by  Lessor,  or  its  successors,  which  shall  continue  as  the  depositories,  regardless  of  changes  in  the  ownership  of  shut-in  royalty.  If  at  any  time 
that  Lessee  pays  or  tenders  shut-in  royalty,  two  or  more  parties  are,  or  claim  to  be,  entitled  to  receive  same.  Lessee  may,  in  lieu  of  any  other 
method  of  payment  herein  provided,  pay  or  tender  such  shut-in  royalty,  in  the  manner  above  specified,  either  jointly  to  such  parties  or  separately 
to  each  in  accordance  with  their  respective  ownerships  thereof,  as  Lessee  may  elect.  Any  payment  hereunder  may  be  made  by  check  or  draft  of 
Lessee  deposited  in  the  mail  or  delivered  to  the  party  entitled  to  receive  payment  or  to  a  depository  bank  provided  for  above  on  or  before  the  last 
date  for  payment.  Nothing  herein  shall  impair  Lessee  s  right  to  release  as  provided  in  paragraph  5  hereof.  In  the  event  of  assignment  of  this  lease  in 
whole  or  in  part,  liability  for  payment  hereunder  shall  rest  exclusively  on  the  then  owner  or  owners  of  this  tease,  severally  as  to  acreage  owned  by 
each. 

4.  Lessee  is  hereby  granted  the  right,  at  its  option,  to  pool  or  unitize  any  land  covered  by  this  lease  with  any  other  land  covered  by  this  lease, 
and/or  with  any  other  land,  lease,  or  leases,  as  to  any  or  all  minerals  or  horizons,  so  as  to  establish  units  containing  not  more  than  80  surface  acres, 
plus  1 0%  acreage  tolerance;  provided,  however,  units  may  be  established  as  to  any  one  or  more  horizons,  or  existing  units  may  be  enlarged  as  to 
any  one  or  more  horizons,  so  as  to  contain  not  more  than  640  surface  acres  plus  10%  acreage  tolerance,  if  limited  to  one  or  more  of  the  following: 
M )  gas,  other  than  casinghead  gas,  (2)  liquid  hydrocarbons  (condensate)  which  are  not  liquids  in  the  subsurface  reservoir,  (3)  minerals  produced 
from  wells  classified  as  gas  wells  by  the  conservation  agency  having  jurisdiction,  If  larger  units  than  any  of  those  herein  permitted,  either  at  the 
time  established,  or  after  enlargement,  are  permitted  or  required  under  any  governmental  rule  or  order,  for  the  drilling  or  operation  of  a  well  at  a 
regular  location,  or  for  obtaining  maximum  allowable  from  any  well  to  be  drilled,  drilling,  or  already  drilled,  any  such  unit  may  be  established  or 
enlarged  to  conform  to  the  size  permitted  or  required  by  such  governmental  order  or  rule.  Lessee  shall  exercise  said  option  as  to  each  desired  unit 
by  executing  an  instrument  identifying  such  unit  and  filing  it  for  record  in  the  public  office  in  which  this  lease  is  recorded.  Such  unit  shall  become 
effective  as  of  the  date  provided  for  in  said  instrument  or  instruments  but  if  said  instrument  or  instruments  make  no  such  provision,  then  such  unit 
shall  become  effective  on  the  date  such  instrument  or  instruments  are  so  filed  of  record.  Each  of  said  options  may  be  exercised  by  Lessee  at  any 
time  and  from  time  to  time  while  this  lease  is  in  force,  and  whether  before  or  after  operations  or  production  has  been  established  either  on  said 
land,  or  on  the  portion  of  said  land  included  in  the  unit,  or  on  other  land  unitized  therewith.  A  unit  established  hereunder  shall  be  valid  and  effective 
for  all  purposes  of  this  lease  even  though  there  may  be  mineral,  royalty,  or  leasehold  interests  in  lands  within  the  unit  which  are  not  effectively 
pooled  or  unitized.  Any  operations  conducted  on  any  part  of  such  unitized  land  shall  be  considered,  for  all  purposes,  except  the  payment  of 
royalty,  operations  conducted  upon  said  land  under  this  lease.  There  shall  be  allocated  to  the  land  covered  by  this  lease  within  each  such  unit  (or 
to  each  separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  lease  covers  separate  tracts  within  the  unit)  that  proportion  of  the  total  production  of  unitized 
minerals  from  the  unit,  after  deducting  any  used  in  lease  or  unit  operations,  which  the  number  of  surface  acres  in  such  land  (or  in  each  such 
separate  tract)  covered  by  this  lease  within  the  unit  bears  to  Ibe  total  number  of  surface  acres  in  the  unit,  and  the  production  so  allocated  shall  be 
considered  for  all  purposes,  including  payment  or  delivery  of  royalty,  overriding  royalty  and  any  other  payments  out  of  production,  to  be  the  entire 
production  of  unitized  minerals  from  the  land  to  which  allocated  in  the  same  manner  as  though  produced  mere  from  under  the  terms  of  this  lease. 
The  owner  of  the  reversionary  estate  of  any  term  royalty  or  mineral  estate  agrees  that  the  accrual  of  royalties  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  or  of 
shut-in  royalties  from  a  well  on  the  unit  shall  satisfy  any  limitation  of  term  requinng  production  of  oil  or  gas.

ADDENDUM 


ATTACHED  TO  AND  MADE  A  PART  OF  THAT  CERTAIN  OIL,  GAS  AND  MINERAL  LEASE  DATED  THE  _7_  DAY  OF  NOVEMBER, 
2008,  BETWEEN  Stephen  F.  Urban,  Jr.,  and  Susan  Elizabeth  Urban  a/k/a  Susan  E.  Urban,  husband  and  wife,  AS  LESSORS  AND 
XTO  ENERGY  INC.,  AS  LESSEE,  COVERING  0.460  ACRES  OF  LAND,  MORE  OR  LESS,  OUT  OF  THE  J.  M.  GANN  SURVEY  A-575 
IN  TARRANT  COUNTY,  TEXAS. 

THE  PROVISIONS  OF  ADDENDUM  SUPERSEDE  COMPLETELY  ANY  PROVISIONS  TO  THE  CONTRARY  CONTAINED  IN  THE 
LEASE  TO  WHICH  THIS  ADDENDUM  IS  ATTACHED. 

15.  Minerals  Covered.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  hereof,  this  lease  covers  only  oil  and  gas.  The  term  "oil  and 
gas"  means  oil,  gas.  and  other  liquid  and  gaseous  hydrocarbons  and  their  constituent  elements  produced  through  a 
well  bore. 


Gas  Royalty,  (a)  Royalties  on  oil,  gas  and  other  substances  produced  and  saved  hereunder  shall  be  paid  by  Lessee 
to  Lessor  as  follows:  (a)  for  oil  and  other  liquid  hydrocarbons  separated  at  Lessee's  separator  facilities,  the  royalty  shall 
be  twenty  five  percent  (25%)  of  such  production,  to  be  delivered  at  Lessee's  option  to  Lessor  at  the  wellhead  or  to 
Lessor's  credit  at  the  oil  purchaser's  transportation  facilities,  provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  continuing  right  to 
purchase  such  production  at  the  wellhead  market  price  then  prevailing  in  the  same  field  (or  if  there  is  no  such  price  then 
prevailing  in  the  same  field,  then  in  the  nearest  field  in  which  there  is  such  a  prevailing  price)  for  production  of  similar 
grade  and  gravity;  and  (b)  for  gas  (including  casinghead  gas)  and  all  other  substances  covered  hereby,  the  royalty  shall 
be  twenty  five  percent  (25%)  of  the  proceeds  realized  by  Lessee  from  the  sale  thereof,  computed  at  the  point  of  sale, 
less  a  proportionate  part  of  ad  valorem  taxes  and  production,  severance  or  other  excise  taxes,  and  less  the  permitted 
unaffiliated  third  party  deductions  described  below;  provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  continuing  right  to  purchase 
such  production  at  the  prevailing  wellhead  market  price  paid  for  production  of  similar  quality  in  Ihe  same  field  (or  if  there 
is  no  such  price  then  prevailing  in  the  same  field,  then  in  the  nearest  field  in  which  there  is  such  a  prevailing  price) 
pursuant  to  comparable  purchase  contracts  entered  into  on  the  same  or  nearest  preceding  date  as  the  date  on  which 
Lessee  commences  its  purchases  hereunder. 

(b)  Royalties  on  oil,  gas  and  other  substances  produced  and  saved  hereunder  which  are  processed  in  a  processing 
plant  in  which  Lessee,  or  an  affiliate  of  Lessee,  has  a  direct  or  indirect  interest,  shall  be  calculated  based  upon  the 
higher  of  the  proceeds  received  or  the  market  value  of  the  products  so  processed.  Similarly,  on  oil,  gas  and  other 
substances  produced  and  saved  hereunder  which  are  sold  to  Lessee,  or  an  affiliate  of  Lessee,  royalties  shall  be  paid 
based  upon  the  higher  of  Ihe  market  value  of  the  products  so  sold  and  the  proceeds  received  by  Lessee  for  said 
products.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  except  for  nonaffiliated  third-party  charges  incurred  or  paid 
by  Lessee,  in  no  event  shall  any  of  Lessor's  royalty  bear  any  part  of  the  costs  of  production  or  any  post-production  costs, 
including  costs  of  lifting,  gathering,  dehydration,  compression,  separation,  delivery,  transportation,  manufacture, 
processing,  treating  or  marketing,  or  for  construction,  operation  or  depreciation  of  any  plant  or  other  facility  or 
equipment  for  processing  or  treating  oil  or  gas  produced  from  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith.  In  no 
event  shall  Lessor  receive  a  price  greater  than  or  less  than  Lessee  in  sales  to  nonaffiliates. 

(c)  As  used  herein,  "affiliate"  means  (i)  a  corporation,  joint  venture,  partnership  or  other  entity  that  owns  more  than  ten 
percent  (10%)  of  the  outstanding  voting  interest  of  Lessee  or  in  which  Lessee  owns  more  than  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the 
outstanding  voting  interest;  or  (ii)  a  corporation,  joint  venture,  partnership  or  other  entity  in  which,  together  with  Lessee, 
more  than  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the  outstanding  voting  interest  of  both  the  Lessee  and  the  other  corporation,  joint 
venture,  partnership  or  other  entity  is  owned  or  controlled  by  the  same  person  or  group  of  persons. 

Shut-in  Royalty.  If  at  the  end  of  the  primary  term  or  any  time  thereafter  one  or  more  wells  on  the  leased  premises  or 
lands  pooled  therewith  are  capable  of  producing  oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered  hereby  in  paying  quantities,  but 
such  well  or  wells  are  either  shut-in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  such  well  or  wells  shall 
nevertheless  be  deemed  to  be  producing  in  paying  quantities  for  the  purpose  of  maintaining  this  Lease.  A  well  that  has 
been  drilled  but  not  fraced  shall  be  deemed  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities.  If  for  a  period  of  ninety  (90) 
consecutive  days  such  well  or  wells  are  shut-in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  then  Lessee  shall 
pay  shut-in  royalty  of  twenty  five  dollars  ($25.00)  per  acre  then  covered  by  this  Lease  on  or  before  the  end  of  said 
90-day  period  and  thereafter  on  or  before  each  anniversary  of  the  date  the  first  payment  is  due;  provided,  however,  that 
if  this  Lease  is  otherwise  being  maintained  by  operations,  or  if  production  is  being  sold  by  Lessee  from  another  well  or 
wells  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  no  shut-in  royalty  shall  be  due  until  the  end  of  the  90-day  period 
next  following  cessation  of  such  operations  or  production.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  it  is 
expressly  understood  and  agreed  that  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  Lessee  shall  not  have  the  right  to 
continue  this  Lease  in  force  by  payment  of  shut-in  royalty  for  more  than  one  single  period  of  up  to  two  (2)  consecutive 
years. 

No  Surface  Operations.  It  is  hereby  agreed  and  understood  that  there  shall  be  no  drilling  activities  on  the  surface  of 
the  leased  premises  without  the  prior  written  permission  from  the  surface  owner  of  the  applicable  portion  of  the  leased 
premises.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this  waiver  of  surface  shall  not  be  construed  as  a  waiver  of  the  rights  of 
Lessee  to  utilize  the  subsurface  of  the  leased  premises  under  this  lease,  and  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  to  exploit, 
explore  for ,  develop  and  produce  oil,  gas  and  other  covered  minerals  under  this  lease  from  wells  from  surface  locations 
off  the  leased  premises,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  directional  or  horizontal  drilling  activity  which  comes  under  the 
surface  of  the  leased  premises.  This  drilling  surface  waiver  does  not  apply  to  any  surface  rights  associated  with 
instruments  other  than  this  lease. 


Vertical  Pugh.  Upon  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  of  this  Lease,  upon  the  expiration  of  any  extension  or  renewal  of 
the  primary  term,  or  after  cessation  of  operations  as  provided  herein,  whichever  occurs  last,  this  Lease  shall  terminate 
as  to  all  rights  lying  below  one  hundred  feet  (1 00')  below  the  stratigraphic  equivalent  of  the  deepest  formation  drilled. 

No  Warranties.  Lessor  makes  no  warranty  of  any  kind  with  respect  to  title  to  the  Land.  By  acceptance  of  this  Lease, 
Lessee  acknowledges  that  it  has  been  given  every  opportunity  to  investigate  and  has  conducted  sufficient  investigation 
to  satisfy  itself  as  to  the  title  to  the  Land,  and  Lessee  assumes  all  risk  of  title  failures.  All  warranties  that  might  arise  by 
common  law  or  by  statute,  including  but  not  limited  to  Section  5.023  of  the  Texas  Property  Code  (or  its  successors),  are 
excluded.  If  Lessor  owns  an  interest  in  the  Land  less  than  the  entire  fee  simple  estate,  then  the  royalties  (including 
shut-in  royalties)  payable  hereunder  will  be  reduced  proportionately.  All  royalty  interest  covered  by  this  lease  (whether 
or  not  owned  by  Lessor)  shall  be  paid  out  of  the  royalty  herein  provided,  Lessor  will  use  all  its  reasonable  efforts  to 
assist  Lessee  to  subordinate  any  rights  of  a  mortgage  holder  to  perfect  the  Lessee's  rights  under  this  lease;  provided, 
however,  any  necessary  subordination  shall  be  obtained  by  Lessee  at  Lessee's  sole  expense.  In  the  event  Lessee  is 
unable  to  obtain  a  subordination  agreement,  Lessee,  at  its  option,  may  discharge  any  tax,  mortgage,  or  other  lien  or 
interest  and  other  charges  on  the  Land  superior  to  this  Lease,  and  in  the  event  Lessee  does  so,  Lessee  will  have  the 
option  of  applying  the  royalties  accruing  to  Lessor  toward  payment  of  same  and  Lessee  shall  be  subrogated  to  the 
rights  of  the  holder  thereof.
