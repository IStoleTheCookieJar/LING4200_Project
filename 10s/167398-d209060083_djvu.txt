Since  the  execution,  delivery,  and  recording  of  the  Lease,  it  has  been  discovered  that  the  gross  i  cres  of 
lands  contained  in  the  Lease  does  not  adequately  state  the  lands  Lessor  intended  to  lease  to  Lessee.  Les  ior  and 
Lessee  desire  to  amend  and  correct  the  gross  acres  of  lands  contained  in  the  Lease  to  accurately  identify  the  fends  to 
be  covered  by  the  Lease. 

For  adequate  consideration,  and  the  further  consideration  of  the  obligations  and  agreements  contained  in 
the  Lease,  Lessor  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Lease  shall  cover,  and  the  Lease  is  amended,  so  that  it  now 
covers  the  following  lands  in  the  county  and  state  named  above: 


0. 142242  gross  acres,  more  or  less 

Lessor  ratifies,  adopts,  and  confirms  the  Lease  and  extends  the  Lease  to  cover  the  lands  described 
Amendment  as  if  the  description  of  lands  set  out  above  had  been  originally  included  in  the  Lease.  Lessor 
leases,  and  lets  to  Lessee,  its  successors  and  assigns,  the  lands  described  in  this  Amendment  for  the  purpo 
upon  the  terms,  conditions,  and  provisions  contained  in  the  Lease. 


This  Amendment  shall  be  binding  for  all  purposes  on  Lessor  and  Lessor's  successors,  heirs  and  assig  is 

This  Amendment  is  signed  by  Lessor  and  Lessee  as  of  the  date  of  the  acknowledgment  of  their  signatures 
below,  but  is  effective  for  all-purposes  as  of  the  Effective  Date  stated  above.
