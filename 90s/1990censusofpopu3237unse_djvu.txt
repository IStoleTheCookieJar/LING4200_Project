various  report  series;  additional  1990  census  data  prod- 
ucts such  as  computer  tapes,  microfiche,  and  laser  disks; 
other  related  materials;  and  sources  of  assistance. 

The  data  from  the  1990  census  were  derived  from  a 
limited  number  of  basic  questions  asked  of  the  entire 
population  and  about  every  housing  unit  (referred  to  as  the 
100-percent  questions),  and  from  additional  questions 
asked  of  a  sample  of  the  population  and  housing  units 
(referred  to  as  the  sample  questions).  Two  primary  ver- 
sions of  questionnaires  were  used:  a  short  form  containing 
only  the  100-percent  questions  and  a  long  form  containing 
both  the  100-percent  questions  and  the  additional  sample 
questions.  Appendix  E  presents  facsimiles  of  the  question- 
naire pages  and  the  respondent  instructions  used  to 
collect  the  data  included  in  this  report.  Appendix  F  lists  the 
subjects  that  are  covered  by  the  1 00-percent  and  sample 
components  of  the  1990  census. 

Legal  provision  for  this  census,  which  was  conducted  as 
of  April  1,  1990,  was  made  in  the  Act  of  Congress  of 
August  31,  1954  (amended  August  1957,  December  1975, 
and  October  1976),  which  is  codified  in  Title  13,  United 
States  Code.

HOW  TO  USE  THE  STATISTICAL  TABLES 
Parts  of  a  Statistical  Table 

The  census  data  included  in  printed  reports  are  arranged 
in  tables.  Each  table  includes  four  major  parts:  (1)  heading, 
(2)  boxhead,  (3)  stub,  and  (4)  data  field.  A  typical  census 
report  table  is  illustrated  below. 

The  heading  consists  of  the  table  number,  title,  and 
headnote.  The  table  number  indicates  the  position  of  the 
table  within  the  report,  while  the  title  is  a  brief  statement 
indicating  the  classification,  nature,  and  time  reference  of 
the  data  presented  in  the  table.  The  headnote  is  enclosed 
in  brackets  and  is  located  under  the  title.  It  contains 
statements  that  qualify,  explain,  or  provide  information 
pertaining  to  the  entire  table.  In  some  tables  showing  racial 
and  Hispanic  origin  groups,  the  headnote  includes  infor- 
mation that  data  are  presented  only  when  certain  population- 
size  criteria  (thresholds)  are  met.  (For  more  information  on 
thresholds,  see  the  "User  Notes"  section.) 

The  boxhead  is  under  the  heading.  This  portion  of  the 
table,  which  contains  the  individual  column  heads  or 
captions,  describes  the  data  in  each  vertical  column.  In  the 
boxhead  of  many  tables,  a  spanner  appears  across  and 
above  two  or  more  column  heads  or  across  two  or  more 
lower  spanners.  The  purpose  of  a  spanner  is  to  classify  or 
qualify  items  below  it  or  separate  the  table  into  identifiable 
blocks  in  terms  of  major  aspects  of  the  data.

Report  title 


The  Stub  is  located  at  the  left  edge  of  the  table.  It 
includes  a  listing  of  line  or  row  captions  or  descriptions.  At 
the  top  of  the  stub  is  the  stubhead.  The  stubhead  is 
considered  to  be  an  extension  of  the  table  title  and  usually 
shows  generic  geographic  area  designations  and  restric- 
tions. 

In  the  stub,  several  features  are  used  to  help  the  user 
better  understand  the  contents  of  the  table.  Usually,  a 
block  of  data  lines  is  preceded  by  a  sidehead.  The 
sidehead,  similar  to  a  spanner,  describes  and  classifies  the 
stub  entries  following  it.  The  use  of  indentation  in  a  stub 
indicates  the  relationship  of  one  data  line  to  another. 
Indented  data  lines  represent  subcategories  that  in  most 
instances,  sum  to  a  total.  Occasionally  in  tables,  it  is 
desirable  to  show  one  or  more  single-line  subcategories 
that  do  not  sum  to  the  total.  The  unit  of  measure,  such  as 
dollars,  is  shown  when  it  is  not  clear  from  the  general 
wording  of  the  data  line. 

The  data  field  is  that  part  of  the  table  that  contains  the 
data.  It  extends  from  the  bottom  of  the  boxhead  to  the 
bottom  of  the  table  and  from  the  right  of  the  stub  to  the 
right-hand  edge  of  the  page. 

Both  geographic  and  subject-matter  terms  appear  in 
tables.  It  is  important  to  read  the  definitions  of  the  terms 
used  in  the  tables  because  census  terms  often  are  defined 
in  special  ways  that  reflect  the  manner  in  which  the 
questions  were  asked  and  the  data  were  tabulated.  Defi- 
nitions of  geographic  terms  are  provided  in  appendix  A. 
Subject-matter  terms  are  defined  in  appendix  B. 


Symbols  and  Geographic  Abbreviations 

The  following  symbols  are  used  in  the  tables 
explanations  of  subjects  covered  in  this  report: 


and 


1-2 


•  A  dash  "-"  represents  zero,  a  figure  that  rounds  to  less 
than  0.1,  or  a  percent  that  rounds  to  less  than  0.1. 

•  Three  dots  "..."  mean  not  applicable. 

•  (NA)  means  not  available. 

•  The  prefix  "r"  indicates  that  the  count  has  been  revised 
since  publication  of  1980  reports  or  that  the  area  was 
erroneously  omitted  or  not  shown  in  the  correct  geo- 
graphic relationship  in  the  1980  census  reports.  This 
symbol  appears  only  in  the  1 990  CPH-2,  Population  and 
Housing  Unit  Counts  reports. 

•  A  dagger  "t"  next  to  the  name  of  a  geographic  area 
indicates  that  there  has  been  a  geographic  change(s) 
(for  example,  an  annexation  or  detachment,  a  new 
incorporation,  or  a  name  change)  since  the  information 
published  for  the  1 980  census  for  that  area.  This  symbol 
appears  only  in  the  1 990  CPH-2,  Population  and  Hous- 
ing Unit  Counts  reports.  The  geographic  change  infor- 
mation for  the  entities  in  a  State  is  shown  in  the  "User 
Notes"  section  of  1990  CPH-2,  Population  and  Housing 


HOW  TO  USE  THIS  CENSUS  REPORT 


Unit  Counts  report,  for  that  State.  The  information  for  all 
States  appears  in  the  "User  Notes"  section  of  the 
technical  documentation  for  Summary  Tape  Files  1 
and  3. 

•  A  plus  sign  "+"  or  a  minus  sign  "-"  following  a  figure 
denotes  that  the  median  falls  in  the  initial  or  terminal 
category  of  an  open-ended  distribution.  (For  more  infor- 
mation on  medians,  see  the  discussion  under  "Derived 
Measures"  in  appendix  B.) 

•  A  minus  sign  "-"  preceding  a  figure  denotes  decrease. 

The  following  geographic  abbreviations  are  used  in  the 
tables  and  explanations  of  subjects  covered  in  this  report: 

•  A  "(pt.)"  next  to  the  name  of  a  geographic  area  in  a 
hierarchical  presentation  indicates  that  the  geographic 
entity  is  only  partially  located  in  the  superior  geographic 
entity.  For  example,  a  "(pt.)"  next  to  a  place  name  in  a 
county  subdivision-place  hierarchy  indicates  that  the 
place  is  located  in  more  than  one  county  subdivision. 
(Places  also  may  be  "split"  by  county,  congressional 
district,  urban/rural,  metropolitan  area,  voting  district, 
and  other  geographic  boundaries,  depending  on  the 
presentation.)  Other  geographic  entities  also  can  be 
"split"  by  a  higher-level  entity.  The  exception  is  a 
tabulation  block,  which  is  unique  within  all  geographic 
entities  in  census  products. 

•  BG  is  block  group. 

•  BNA  is  block  numbering  area. 

•  CDP  is  census  designated  place. 

•  CMSA  is  consolidated  metropolitan  statistical  area. 

•  MA  is  metropolitan  area. 

•  MSA  is  metropolitan  statistical  area. 

•  PMSA  is  primary  metropolitan  statistical  area. 

•  TDSA  is  tribal  designated  statistical  area. 

•  TJSA  is  tribal  jurisdiction  statistical  area. 

•  unorg.  is  unorganized  territory. 

•  VTD  is  voting  district. 

Census  tables  often  include  derived  measures  such  as 
medians,  means,  percents,  and  ratios.  More  detailed  infor- 
mation about  derived  measures  is  provided  in  appendix  B. 

CENSUS  TRACT  COMPARABILITY  TABLES 

A  listing  of  all  the  census  tract  reports  in  this  series  and 
Information  on  changes  in  the  boundaries  of  census  tracts 
between  1 980  and  1 990  for  the  area  covered  in  this  report 
appear  on  page  IV-1,  directly  before  the  statistical  tables. 

The  census  tract  comparability  table  shows  the  1980 
components  of  1990  census  tracts  and  1990  components 
of  1980  census  tracts,  as  relevant,  for:  (1)  1980  census 
tracts  that  were  split  into  two  or  more  1 990  census  tracts; 
(2)  1980  census  tracts  that  were  combined  into  new  1990 
census  tracts;  (3)  1980  census  tracts  in  areas  with  new 


numbering  systems  for  1990;  and  (4)  those  census  tracts 
with  boundary  changes  between  1980  and  1990  that 
affected  2.5  percent  or  more  of  the  population  of  the 
census  tract. 

A  census  tract  will  not  appear  in  the  comparability  tables 
if:  (1)  no  change  occurred  between  1980  and  1990; 
(2)  boundary  revisions  affected  fewer  than  2.5  percent  of 
the  persons  and  that  was  the  only  change  that  occurred  to 
that  census  tract;  (3)  the  area  has  block  numbering  areas 
for  1990;  or  (4)  an  area  where  census  tracts  were  defined 
for  the  first  time  in  1990.

GENERAL 
User  Note  1 

Age  Reporting— Review  of  detailed  1990  information 
indicated  that  respondents  tended  to  provide  their  age  as 
of  the  date  of  completion  of  the  questionnaire,  not  their 
age  on  April  1,  1990.  In  addition,  there  may  have  been  a 
tendency  for  respondents  to  round  up  their  age  if  they  were 
close  to  having  a  birthday.  It  is  likely  that  approximately  10 
percent  of  persons  in  most  age  groups  are  actually  1  year 
younger.  For  most  single  years  of  age,  the  misstatements 
are  largely  offsetting.  The  problem  is  most  pronounced  at 
age  0  because  persons  lost  to  age  1  may  not  have  been 
fully  offset  by  the  inclusion  of  babies  born  after  April  1, 
1990,  and  because  there  may  have  been  more  rounding  up 
to  age  1  to  avoid  reporting  age  as  0  years.  (Age  in 
completed  months  was  not  collected  for  infants  under 
age  1.) 

The  reporting  of  age  1  year  older  than  age  on  April  1 , 
1990,  is  likely  to  have  been  greater  in  areas  where  the 
census  data  were  collected  later  in  1 990.  The  magnitude 
of  this  problem  was  much  less  in  the  three  previous 


censuses  where  age  was  typically  derived  from  respond- 
ent data  on  year  of  birth  and  quarter  of  birth.  (For  more 
information  on  the  design  of  the  age  question,  see  the 
discussion  on  comparability  under  "Age"  in  appendix  B.)

data  products,  such  as  Summary  Tape  Files  (STF's)  1  and 
2  and  in  the  1 990  CP-1 ,  General  Population  Characteristics 
State  reports  should  be  used  for  persons  enumerated  at 
"visible  in  street  locations." 

During  "Shelter  and  Street  Night  Enumeration,"  all 
visible  persons  on  the  streets  were  asked  only  the  basic 
100-percent  population  questions  (age,  sex,  marital  status, 
race,  and  Hispanic  origin). 

During  census  processing  of  sample  data,  information 
from  the  long-form  questionnaire  was  inadvertently  assigned 
to  a  very  small  percentage  of  the  visible  in  street  popula- 
tion. 

User  Note  7 

The  estimated  population  totals  for  persons  in  group 
quarters,  specifically  by  group  quarters  type,  that  are 
based  on  census  sample  tabulations  may  differ  from 
comparable  figures  shown  in  100-percent  tabulations.  Such 
differences  result,  in  part,  from  sampling  variability  which 
occurs  because  information  was  obtained  from  a  sample 
of  the  population  rather  than  from  all  persons.  Differences 
also  occur  because  of  nonsampling  errors  which  affect  the 
100-percent  and  sample  data.  Examples  of  nonsampling 
errors  include  respondent  and  enumerator  errors,  process- 
ing errors,  and  nonresponse. 

The  100-percent  data  are  the  official  counts  and  should 
be  used  as  the  source  for  data  on  group  quarters  type 
when  the  primary  focus  is  on  counts  of  the  population  in 
group  quarters,  especially  for  small  areas  such  as  census 
tracts/BNA's  or  blocks.  When  the  group  quarters  popula- 
tion is  shown  by  characteristics  covered  only  on  a  sample 
basis  (for  example,  education,  labor  force  status,  income, 
etc.),  the  sample  figures  should  be  used  within  the  context 
of  the  sampling  variability  associated  with  them. 

For  more  information  on  the  limitations  of  100-percent 
and  sample  data  for  persons  in  group  quarters  and  the 
classification  of  group  quarters  type,  see  appendix  B. 
Reasons  for  the  differences  between  100-percent  and 
sample  totals  will  be  an  important  focus  of  post-census 
research  and  evaluation. 

User  Note  8 

Estimated  population  and  housing  unit  totals  based  on 
tabulations  from  only  the  sample  questionnaires  (sample 
tabulations)  may  differ  from  the  official  counts  as  tabulated 
from  every  census  questionnaire  (100-percent  tabulations). 
Such  differences  result,  in  part,  because  the  sample 
tabulations  are  based  on  information  from  a  sample  of 
households  rather  than  from  all  households  (sampling 
error).  Differences  also  can  occur  because  the  interview 
situation  (length  of  questionnaire,  effect  of  the  interviewer, 
etc.)  and  the  processing  rules  differ  between  the  100- 
percent  and  sample  tabulations.  These  types  of  differ- 
ences are  referred  to  as  nonsampling  errors.  (For  more 
information  on  nonsampling  error,  see  appendix  C.) 


The  1 00-percent  data  are  the  official  counts  and  should 
be  used  as  the  source  of  information  on  population  and 
housing  items  collected  on  the  1 00-percent  questionnaire, 
such  as  age,  race,  Hispanic  origin,  number  of  rooms,  and 
tenure.  This  is  especially  appropriate  when  the  primary 
focus  is  on  counts  of  the  population  or  housing  units  for 
small  areas  such  as  census  tracts/BNA's,  block  groups, 
and  for  American  Indian  and  Alaska  Native  areas.  For 
estimates  of  counts  of  persons  and  housing  units  by 
characteristics  asked  only  on  a  sample  basis  (such  as 
education,  labor  force  status,  income,  and  source  of 
water),  the  sample  estimates  should  be  used  within  the 
context  of  the  error  associated  with  them. 

Many  users  are  interested  in  tabulations  of  items  col- 
lected on  the  sample  cross-classified  by  items  collected  on 
a  100-percent  basis  such  as  age,  race,  sex,  Hispanic 
origin,  and  housing  units  by  tenure.  Given  the  way  the 
weights  were  applied  during  sample  tabulations,  generally, 
there  is  exact  agreement  between  sample  estimates  and 
1 00-percent  counts  for  total  population  and  total  housing 
units  for  most  geographic  areas.  At  the  State  level  and 
higher  geographic  levels,  sample  estimates  and  1 00-percent 
counts  for  population  by  age,  sex,  race,  and  Hispanic  origin 
and  for  housing  units  by  tenure,  number  of  rooms  and  so 
on  would  be  reasonably  similar  and.  In  some  cases,  the 
same. 

At  smaller  geographic  levels,  including  census  tract/ 
BNA,  there  is  still  general  agreement  between  100-percent 
counts  and  sample  estimates  of  total  population  or  hous- 
ing units.  At  smaller  geographic  levels,  however,  there  will 
be  expected  differences  between  sample  estimates  and 
1 00-percent  counts  for  population  by  age,  sex,  race,  and 
Hispanic  origin  and  for  housing  units  by  tenure,  number  of 
rooms  and  so  on.  In  these  cases,  users  may  want  to 
consider  using  derived  measures  (such  as  means  and 
medians)  or  percent  distributions.  Whether  using  absolute 
numbers  or  derived  measures  for  small  population  groups 
and  for  a  small  number  of  housing  units  in  small  geo- 
graphic areas,  users  should  be  cautioned  that  the  sampling 
error  associated  with  these  data  may  be  large. 

Even  though  the  differences  between  sample  estimates 
and  1 00-percent  counts  for  these  categories  are  generally 
small,  the  differences  for  the  American  Indian,  as  well  as 
the  Hispanic  origin  populations,  are  relatively  larger  than 
for  other  groups.  The  following  provides  some  explanation 
for  these  differences. 

State-level  sample  estimates  of  the  number  of  Ameri- 
can Indians  are  generally  higher  than  the  corresponding 
1 00-percent  counts.  It  appears  the  differences  are  prima- 
rily the  result  of  proportionately  higher  reporting  of  "Cher- 
okee" tribe  on  sample  questionnaires.  This  phenomenon 
occurs  primarily  in  off-reservation  areas.  The  reasons  for 
the  greater  reporting  of  Cherokee  on  sample  forms  are  not 
fully  known  at  this  time.  The  Census  Bureau  will  do 
research  to  provide  more  information  on  this  phenomenon. 

For  the  Hispanic  origin  population,  sample  estimates  at 
the  State  level  are  generally  lower  than  the  con-esponding 
100-percent  counts.  The  majority  of  difference  is  caused 


III-2 


USER  NOTES 


by  the  1 00-percent  and  sample  processing  of  the  Hispanic 
question  on  the  sample  questionnaire  when  the  respond- 
ent did  not  mark  any  response  category.  When  processing 
the  sample,  we  used  written  entries  in  race  or  Hispanic 
origin  as  well  as  responses  to  questions  only  asked  on  the 
sample,  such  as  ancestry  and  place  of  birth.  These  proce- 
dures led  to  a  lower  proportion  of  persons  being  assigned 
as  Hispanic  in  sample  processing  than  were  assigned 
during  100-percent  processing.  The  Census  Bureau  will 
evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  1 00-percent  and  sample 
procedures. 

As  in  previous  censuses,  the  Census  Bureau  will  eval- 
uate the  quality  of  the  data  and  make  this  information 
available  to  data  users.  In  the  meanwhile,  both  100- 
percent  and  sample  data  serve  very  important  purposes 
and,  therefore,  should  be  used  within  the  limitations  of  the 
sampling  and  nonsampling  errors. 


White  population  and  for  the  White,  not  of  Hispanic  origin 
population.  Specifically,  complementary  thresholds  are 
used  to  limit  the  presentation  of  characteristics  for  the 
White  population  when  the  population  of  races  other  than 
White  is  small  and  for  the  White,  not  of  Hispanic  origin 
population  when  the  Hispanic  origin  population  is  small. 
For  example,  assume  that  the  threshold  and  comple- 
mentary threshold  are  400  in  a  table  showing  data  by  race 
and  Hispanic  origin  for  counties.  The  threshold  of  400 
applies  to  each  group,  and  in  addition,  the  complementary 
threshold  of  400  applies  to  White  and  to  White,  not  of 
Hispanic  origin.  The  following  figure  shows  how  the  thresh- 
old and  complementary  threshold  for  race  and  Hispanic 
origin  apply  for  a  hypothetical  county.  (For  simplicity,  it  is 
assumed  that  the  "Other  race"  population  of  the  county  is 
zero  because  characteristics  are  not  shown  for  the  "Other 
race"  population  below  the  State  level. 


User  Note  9 

Thresholds  and  Complementary  Thresholds— To  show 
characteristics  for  a  large  number  of  racial  and  Hispanic 
groups  and  to  avoid  using  a  large  number  of  pages  to  show 
characteristics  for  small  population  groups,  population 
thresholds  are  used  in  some  tables  in  selected  reports. 
Also,  complementary  population  thresholds  are  used  in 
some  tables  to  avoid  showing  largely  repetitive  data  for  the

Thresholds  in  CPH-3— For  this  report  series,  the  thres- 
hold and  complementary  threshold  of  400  persons  used  to 
present  characteristics  for  racial  and  Hispanic  origin  groups 
are  applied  separately  for  100-percent  and  sample  data. 
Therefore,  the  geographic  coverage  may  differ  between 
tables  showing  1 00-percent  data  and  tables  showing  sam- 
ple data.

These  definitions  are  for  all  geographic  entities  and 
concepts  that  the  Census  Bureau  will  include  in  its  stand- 
ard 1990  census  data  products.  Not  all  entities  and  con-

AMERICAN  INDIAN  AND  ALASKA  NATIVE  AREA 

Alaska  Native  Regional  Corporation  (ANRC) 

Alaska  Native  Regional  Corporations  (ANRC's)  are  cor- 
porate entities  established  under  the  Alaska  Native  Claims 
Settlement  Act  of  1972,  Public  Law  92-203,  as  amended 
by  Public  Law  94-204,  to  conduct  both  business  and 
nonprofit  affairs  of  Alaska  Natives.  Alaska  is  divided  into 


AREA  CLASSIFICATIONS 


A-1 


12  ANRC's  that  cover  the  entire  State,  except  for  the 
Annette  Islands  Reserve.  The  boundaries  of  the  12  ANRC's 
were  established  by  the  Department  of  the  Interior,  in 
cooperation  with  Alaska  Natives.  Each  ANRC  was  designed 
to  include,  as  far  as  practicable,  Alaska  Natives  with  a 
common  heritage  and  common  interests.  The  ANRC  bound- 
aries for  the  1 990  census  were  identified  by  the  Bureau  of 
Land  Management.  A  13th  region  was  established  for 
Alaska  Natives  who  are  not  permanent  residents  and  who 
chose  not  to  enroll  in  one  of  the  12  ANRC's;  no  census 
products  are  prepared  for  the  13th  region.  ANRC's  were 
first  identified  for  the  1 980  census. 

Each  ANRC  is  assigned  a  two-digit  census  code  ranging 
from  07  through  84.  These  census  codes  are  assigned  in 
alphabetical  order  of  the  ANRC's. 

Alaska  Native  Village  (ANV)  Statistical  Area 

Alaska  Native  villages  (ANV's)  constitute  tribes,  bands, 
clans,  groups,  villages,  communities,  or  associations  in 
Alaska  that  are  recognized  pursuant  to  the  Alaska  Native 
Claims  Settlement  Act  of  1 972,  Public  Law  92-203.  Because 
ANV's  do  not  have  legally  designated  boundaries,  the 
Census  Bureau  has  established  Alaska  Native  village 
statistical  areas  (ANVSA's)  for  statistical  purposes.  For  the 
1990  census,  the  Census  Bureau  cooperated  with  officials 
of  the  nonprofit  corporation  within  each  participating  Alaska 
Native  Regional  Corporation  (ANRC),  as  well  as  other 
knowledgeable  officials,  to  delineate  boundaries  that  encom- 
pass the  settled  area  associated  with  each  ANV.  ANVSA's 
are  located  within  ANRC's  and  do  not  cross  ANRC  bound- 
aries. ANVSA's  for  the  1990  census  replace  the  ANV's 
that  the  Census  Bureau  recognized  for  the  1 980  census. 

Each  ANVSA  is  assigned  a  four-digit  census  code 
ranging  from  6001  through  8989.  Each  ANVSA  also  is 
assigned  a  five-digit  FIPS  code.  Both  the  census  and  FIRS 
codes  are  assigned  in  alphabetical  order  of  ANVSA's. 

American  Indian  Reservation  and  Trust  Land 

American  Indian  Reservation—Federal  American  Indian 
reservations  are  areas  with  boundaries  established  by 
treaty,  statute,  and/or  executive  or  court  order,  and  rec- 
ognized by  the  Federal  Government  as  territory  in  which 
American  Indian  tribes  have  jurisdiction.  State  reservations 
are  lands  held  in  trust  by  State  governments  for  the  use 
and  benefit  of  a  given  tribe.  The  reservations  and  their 
boundaries  were  identified  for  the  1990  census  by  the 
Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  (BIA),  Department  of  Interior  (for 
Federal  reservations),  and  State  governments  (for  State 
reservations).  The  names  of  American  Indian  reservations 
recognized  by  State  governments,  but  not  by  the  Federal 
Government,  are  followed  by  "(State)."  Areas  composed 
of  reservation  lands  that  are  administered  jointly  and/or 
are  claimed  by  two  reservations,  as  identified  by  the  BIA, 
are  called  "joint  areas,"  and  are  treated  as  separate 
American  Indian  reservations  for  census  purposes. 


Federal  reservations  may  cross  State  boundaries,  and 
Federal  and  State  reservations  may  cross  county,  county 
subdivision,  and  place  boundaries.  For  reservations  that 
cross  State  boundaries,  only  the  portion  of  the  reserva- 
tions in  a  given  State  are  shown  in  the  data  products  for 
that  State;  the  entire  reservations  are  shown  in  data 
products  for  the  United  States. 

Each  American  Indian  reservation  is  assigned  a  four- 
digit  census  code  ranging  from  0001  through  4989.  These 
census  codes  are  assigned  in  alphabetical  order  of  Amer- 
ican Indian  reservations  nationwide,  except  that  joint  areas 
appear  at  the  end  of  the  code  range.  Each  American  Indian 
reservation  also  is  assigned  a  five-digit  FIPS  code;  because 
the  FIPS  codes  are  assigned  in  alphabetical  sequence  of 
American  Indian  reservations  within  each  State,  the  FIPS 
code  is  different  in  each  State  for  reservations  in  more 
than  one  State. 

Trust  Land— Trust  lands  are  property  associated  with  a 
particular  American  Indian  reservation  or  tribe,  held  in  trust 
by  the  Federal  Government.  Trust  lands  may  be  held  in 
trust  either  for  a  tribe  (tribal  trust  land)  or  for  an  individual 
member  of  a  tribe  (individual  trust  land).  Trust  lands 
recognized  for  the  1990  census  comprise  all  tribal  trust 
lands  and  inhabited  individual  trust  lands  located  outside 
of  a  reservation  boundary.  As  with  other  American  Indian 
areas,  trust  lands  may  be  located  in  more  than  one  State. 
Only  the  trust  lands  in  a  given  State  are  shown  in  the  data 
products  for  that  State;  all  trust  lands  associated  with  a 
reservation  or  tribe  are  shown  in  data  products  for  the 
United  States.  The  Census  Bureau  first  reported  data  for 
tribal  trust  lands  for  the  1 980  census. 

Trust  lands  are  assigned  a  four-digit  census  code  and  a 
five-digit  FIPS  code,  the  same  as  that  for  the  reservation 
with  which  they  are  associated.  Trust  lands  not  associated 
with  a  reservation  are  presented  by  tribal  name,  inter- 
spersed alphabetically  among  the  reservations. 

Tribal  Designated  Statistical  Area  (TDSA) 

Tribal  designated  statistical  areas  (TDSA's)  are  areas, 
delineated  outside  Oklahoma  by  federally-  and  State- 
recognized  tribes  without  a  land  base  or  associated  trust 
lands,  to  provide  statistical  areas  for  which  the  Census 
Bureau  tabulates  data.  TDSA's  represent  areas  generally 
containing  the  American  Indian  population  over  which 
federally-recognized  tribes  have  jurisdiction  and  areas  in 
which  State  tribes  provide  benefits  and  services  to  their 
members.  The  names  of  TDSA's  delineated  by  State- 
recognized  tribes  are  followed  by  "(State)."  The  Census 
Bureau  did  not  recognize  TDSA's  before  the  1990  census. 

Each  TDSA  is  assigned  a  four-digit  census  code  ranging 
from  9001  through  9589.  The  census  codes  are  assigned 
in  alphabetical  order  of  TDSA's  nationwide.  Each  TDSA 
also  is  assigned  a  five-digit  FIPS  code  in  alphabetical  order 
within  State.

AREA  CLASSIFICATIONS 


Tribal  Jurisdiction  Statistical  Area  (TJSA) 

Tribal  jurisdiction  statistical  areas  (USA's)  are  areas, 
delineated  by  federally-recognized  tribes  in  Oklahoma 
without  a  reservation,  for  which  the  Census  Bureau  tabu- 
lates data.  USA's  represent  areas  generally  containing 
the  Annerican  Indian  population  over  which  one  or  more 
tribal  governments  have  jurisdiction;  if  tribal  officials  delin- 
eated adjacent  USA's  so  that  they  include  some  duplicate 
territory,  the  overlap  area  is  called  a  "joint  use  area," 
which  is  treated  as  a  separate  USA  for  census  purposes. 

USA's  replace  the  "Historic  Areas  of  Oklahoma  (exclud- 
ing urbanized  areas)"  shown  in  1980  census  data  prod- 
ucts. The  Historic  Areas  of  Oklahoma  comprised  the 
territory  located  within  reservations  that  had  legally  estab- 
lished boundaries  from  1900  to  1907;  these  reservations 
were  dissolved  during  the  2-  to  3-year  period  preceding  the 
statehood  of  Oklahoma  in  1907.  The  Historic  Areas  of 
Oklahoma  (excluding  urbanized  areas)  were  identified  only 
for  the  1 980  census. 

Each  TJSA  is  assigned  a  four-digit  census  code  ranging 
from  5001  through  5989.  The  census  codes  are  assigned 
in  alphabetical  order  of  TJSA's,  except  that  joint  areas 
appear  at  the  end  of  the  code  range.  Each  TJSA  also  is 
assigned  a  five-digit  FIPS  code  in  alphabetical  order  within 
Oklahoma. 

AREA  MEASUREMENT 

Area  measurements  provide  the  size,  in  square  kilome- 
ters (also  in  square  miles  in  printed  reports),  recorded  for 
each  geographic  entity  for  which  the  Census  Bureau 
tabulates  data  in  general-purpose  data  products  (except 
crews-of -vessels  entities  and  ZIP  Codes).  (Square  kilome- 
ters may  be  divided  by  2.59  to  convert  an  area  measure- 
ment to  square  miles.)  Area  was  calculated  from  the 
specific  set  of  boundaries  recorded  for  the  entity  in  the 
Census  Bureau's  geographic  data  base  (see  "TIGER"). 
On  machine-readable  files,  area  measurements  are  shown 
to  three  decimal  places;  the  decimal  point  is  implied.  In 
printed  reports  and  listings,  area  measurements  are  shown 
to  one  decimal. 

The  Census  Bureau  provides  measurements  for  both 
land  area  and  total  water  area  for  the  1 990  census;  the 
water  figure  includes  inland,  coastal.  Great  Lakes,  and 
territorial  water.  (For  the  1 980  census,  the  Census  Bureau 
provided  area  measurements  for  land  and  inland  water.) 
The  Census  Bureau  will  provide  measurements  for  the 
component  types  of  water  for  the  affected  entities  in  a 
separate  file.  "Inland  water"  consists  of  any  lake,  reser- 
voir, pond,  or  similar  body  of  water  that  is  recorded  in  the 
Census  Bureau's  geographic  data  base.  It  also  includes 
any  river,  creek,  canal,  stream,  or  similar  feature  that  is 
recorded  in  that  data  base  as  a  two-dimensional  feature 
(rather  than  as  a  single  line).  The  portions  of  the  oceans 
and  related  large  embayments  (such  as  the  Chesapeake 
Bay  and  Puget  Sound),  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and  the 
Caribbean  Sea  that  belong  to  the  United  States  and  its 
territories  are  considered  to  be  "coastal"  and  "territorial" 


waters;  the  Great  Lakes  are  treated  as  a  separate  water 
entity.  Rivers  and  bays  that  empty  into  these  bodies  of 
water  are  treated  as  "inland  water"  from  the  point  beyond 
which  they  are  narrower  than  one  nautical  mile  across. 
Identification  of  land  and  inland,  coastal,  and  territorial 
waters  is  for  statistical  purposes,  and  does  not  necessarily 
reflect  legal  definitions  thereof. 

By  definition,  census  blocks  do  not  include  water  within 
their  boundaries;  therefore,  the  water  area  of  a  block  is 
always  zero.  Land  area  measurements  may  disagree  with 
the  information  displayed  on  census  maps  and  in  the 
TIGER  file  because,  for  area  measurement  purposes, 
features  identified  as  "intermittent  water"  and  "glacier" 
are  reported  as  land  area.  For  this  reason,  it  may  not  be 
possible  to  derive  the  land  area  for  an  entity  by  summing 
the  land  area  of  its  component  census  blocks.  In  addition, 
the  water  area  measurement  reported  for  some  geo- 
graphic entities  includes  water  that  is  not  included  in  any 
lower-level  geographic  entity.  Therefore,  because  water  is 
contained  only  in  a  higher-level  geographic  entity,  sum- 
ming the  water  measurements  for  all  the  component 
lower-level  geographic  entities  will  not  yield  the  water  area 
of  that  higher-level  entity.  This  occurs,  for  example,  where 
water  is  associated  with  a  county  but  is  not  within  the  legal 
boundary  of  any  minor  civil  division,  or  the  water  is 
associated  with  a  State  but  is  not  within  the  legal  boundary 
of  any  county.  Crews-of-vessels  entities  (see  "Census 
Tract  and  Block  Numbering  Area"  and  "Block")  do  not 
encompass  territory  and  therefore  have  no  area  measure- 
ments. ZIP  Codes  do  not  have  specific  boundaries,  and 
therefore,  also  do  not  have  area  measurements. 

The  accuracy  of  any  area  measurement  figure  is  limited 
by  the  inaccuracy  inherent  in  (1)  the  location  and  shape 
of  the  various  boundary  features  in  the  data  base,  and 
(2)  rounding  affecting  the  last  digit  in  all  operations  that 
compute  and/or  sum  the  area  measurements. 

BLOCK 

Census  blocks  are  small  areas  bounded  on  all  sides  by 
visible  features  such  as  streets,  roads,  streams,  and 
railroad  tracks,  and  by  invisible  boundaries  such  as  city, 
town,  township,  and  county  limits,  property  lines,  and  short, 
imaginary  extensions  of  streets  and  roads. 

Tabulation  blocks,  used  in  census  data  products,  are  in 
most  cases  the  same  as  collection  blocks,  used  in  the 
census  enumeration.  In  some  cases,  collection  blocks 
have  been  "split"  into  two  or  more  parts  required  for  data 
tabulations.  Tabulation  blocks  do  not  cross  the  boundaries 
of  counties,  county  subdivisions,  places,  census  tracts  or 
block  numbering  areas,  American  Indian  and  Alaska  Native 
areas,  congressional  districts,  voting  districts,  urban  or 
rural  areas,  or  urbanized  areas.  The  1990  census  is  the 
first  for  which  the  entire  United  States  and  its  possessions 
are  block-numbered. 

Blocks  are  numbered  uniquely  within  each  census  tract 
or  BNA.  A  block  is  identified  by  a  three-digit  number, 
sometimes  with  a  single  alphabetical  suffix.  Block  numbers 


AREA  CLASSIFICATIONS 


A-3 


with  suffixes  generally  represent  collection  blocks  that 
were  "split"  in  order  to  identify  separate  geographic  enti- 
ties that  divide  the  original  block.  For  example,  when  a  city 
limit  runs  through  data  collection  block  101,  the  data  for 
the  portion  inside  the  city  is  tabulated  in  block  101 A  and 
the  portion  outside,  in  block  1 01 B.  A  block  number  with  the 
suffix  "Z"  represents  a  "crews-of-vessels"  entity  for  which 
the  Census  Bureau  tabulates  data,  but  that  does  not 
represent  a  true  geographic  area;  such  a  block  is  shown  on 
census  maps  associated  with  an  anchor  symbol  and  a 
census  tract  or  block  numbering  area  with  a  .99  suffix. 


BLOCK  GROUP  (BG) 

Geographic  Block  Group 

A  geographic  block  group  (BG)  is  a  cluster  of  blocks 
having  the  same  first  digit  of  their  three-digit  identifying 
numbers  within  a  census  tract  or  block  numbering  area 
(BNA).  For  example,  BG  3  within  a  census  tract  or  BNA 
includes  all  blocks  numbered  between  301  and  397.  In 
most  cases,  the  numbering  involves  substantially  fewer 
than  97  blocks.  Geographic  BG's  never  cross  census  tract 
or  BNA  boundaries,  but  may  cross  the  boundaries  of 
county  subdivisions,  places,  American  Indian  and  Alaska 
Native  areas,  urbanized  areas,  voting  districts,  and  con- 
gressional districts.  BG's  generally  contain  between  250 
and  550  housing  units,  with  the  ideal  size  being  400 
housing  units. 

Tabulation  Block  Group 

In  the  data  tabulations,  a  geographic  BG  may  be  split  to 
present  data  for  every  unique  combination  of  county 
subdivision,  place,  American  Indian  and  Alaska  Native 
area,  urbanized  area,  voting  district,  urban/rural  and  con- 
gressional district  shown  in  the  data  product;  for  example, 
if  BG  3  is  partly  in  a  city  and  partly  outside  the  city,  there 
will  be  separate  tabulated  records  for  each  portion  of  BG  3. 
BG's  are  used  in  tabulating  decennial  census  data  nation- 
wide in  the  1 990  census,  in  all  block-numbered  areas  in  the 
1980  census,  and  in  Tape  Address  Register  (TAR)  areas  in 
the  1970  census.  For  purposes  of  data  presentation,  BG's 
are  a  substitute  for  the  enumeration  districts  (ED's)  used 
for  reporting  data  in  many  parts  of  the  United  States  for  the 
1970  and  1980  censuses,  and  in  all  areas  for  pre-1970 
censuses. 


BOUNDARY  CHANGES 

The  boundaries  of  some  counties,  county  subdivisions, 
American  Indian  and  Alaska  Native  areas,  and  many 
incorporated  places,  changed  between  those  reported  for 
the  1980  census  and  January  1,  1990.  Boundary  changes 
to  legal  entities  result  from: 


1.  Annexations  to  or  detachments  from  legally  estab- 
lished governmental  units. 

2.  Mergers  or  consolidations  of  two  or  more  governmen- 
tal units. 

3.  Establishment  of  new  governmental  units. 

4.  Disincorporations  or  disorganizations  of  existing  gov- 
ernmental units. 

5.  Changes  in  treaties  and  Executive  Orders. 

The  historical  counts  shown  for  counties,  county  subdi- 
visions, and  places  are  not  updated  for  such  changes,  and 
thus  reflect  the  population  and  housing  units  in  the  area  as 
delineated  at  each  census.  Information  on  boundary  changes 
reported  between  the  1 980  and  1 990  censuses  for  coun- 
ties, county  subdivisions,  and  incorporated  places  is  pre- 
sented in  the  "User  Notes"  section  of  the  technical 
documentation  of  Summary  Tape  Files  1  and  3,  and  in  the 
1 990  CPH-2,  Population  and  Housing  Unit  Counts  printed 
reports.  For  information  on  boundary  changes  for  such 
areas  in  the  decade  preceding  other  decennial  censuses, 
see  the  Number  of  Infiabitants  reports  for  each  census. 
Boundary  changes  are  not  reported  for  some  areas,  such 
as  census  designated  places  and  block  groups. 

CENSUS  REGION  AND  CENSUS  DIVISION 

Census  Division 

Census  divisions  are  groupings  of  States  that  are  sub- 
divisions of  the  four  census  regions.  There  are  nine 
divisions,  which  the  Census  Bureau  adopted  in  1910  for 
the  presentation  of  data.  The  regions,  divisions,  and  their 
constituent  States  are: 

Northeast  Region 

New  England  Division: 

Maine,  New  Hampshire,  Vermont,  Massachusetts, 
Rhode  Island,  Connecticut 

Middle  Atlantic  Division: 

New  York,  New  Jersey,  Pennsylvania 

Midwest  Region

Census  Region 

Census  regions  are  groupings  of  States  that  subdivide 
the  United  States  for  the  presentation  of  data.  There  are 
four  regions— Northeast,  Midwest,  South,  and  West.  Each 
of  the  four  census  regions  is  divided  into  two  or  more 
census  divisions.  Prior  to  1984,  the  Midwest  region  was 
named  the  North  Central  region.  From  1910,  when  census 
regions  were  established,  through  the  1940's,  there  were 
three  regions— North,  South,  and  West. 

CENSUS  TRACT  AND  BLOCK  NUMBERING 
AREA 

Block  Numbering  Area  (BNA) 

Block  numbering  areas  (BNA's)  are  small  statistical 
subdivisions  of  a  county  for  grouping  and  numbering 
blocks  in  nonmetropolitan  counties  where  local  census 
statistical  areas  committees  have  not  established  census 
tracts.  State  agencies  and  the  Census  Bureau  delineated 
BNA's  for  the  1990  census,  using  guidelines  similar  to 
those  for  the  delineation  of  census  tracts.  BNA's  do  not 
cross  county  boundaries. 

BNA's  are  identified  by  a  four-digit  basic  number  and 
may  have  a  two-digit  suffix;  for  example,  9901.07.  The 
decimal  point  separating  the  four-digit  basic  BNA  number 
from  the  two-digit  suffix  is  shown  in  printed  reports,  in 
microfiche,  and  on  census  maps;  in  machine-readable 
files,  the  decimal  point  is  implied.  Many  BNA's  do  not  have 
a  suffix;  in  such  cases,  the  suffix  field  is  left  blank  in  all  data 
products.  BNA  numbers  range  from  9501  through  9989.99, 
and  are  unique  within  a  county  (numbers  in  the  range  of 
0001  through  9499.99  denote  a  census  tract).  The  suffix 
.99  identifies  a  BNA  that  was  populated  entirely  by  persons 
aboard  one  or  more  civilian  or  military  ships.  A  "crews-of- 
vessels"  BNA  appears  on  census  maps  only  as  an  anchor 
symbol  with  its  BNA  number  (and  block  numbers  on  maps 
showing  block  numbers);  the  BNA  relates  to  the  ships 
associated  with  the  onshore  BNA's  having  the  same 
four-digit  basic  number.  Suffixes  in  the  range  .80  through 
.98  usually  identify  BNA's  that  either  were  revised  or  were 
created  during  the  1990  census  data  collection  activities. 


Some  of  these  revisions  produced  BNA's  that  have  extremely 
small  land  area  and  may  have  little  or  no  population  or 
housing.  For  data  analysis,  such  a  BNA  can  be  summa- 
rized with  an  adjacent  BNA. 

Census  Tract 

Census  tracts  are  small,  relatively  permanent  statistical 
subdivisions  of  a  county.  Census  tracts  are  delineated  for 
all  metropolitan  areas  (MA's)  and  other  densely  populated 
counties  by  local  census  statistical  areas  committees 
following  Census  Bureau  guidelines  (more  than  3,000 
census  tracts  have  been  established  in  221  counties 
outside  MA's).  Six  States  (California,  Connecticut,  Dela- 
ware, Hawaii,  New  Jersey,  and  Rhode  Island)  and  the 
District  of  Columbia  are  covered  entirely  by  census  tracts. 
Census  tracts  usually  have  between  2,500  and  8,000 
persons  and,  when  first  delineated,  are  designed  to  be 
homogeneous  with  respect  to  population  characteristics, 
economic  status,  and  living  conditions.  Census  tracts  do 
not  cross  county  boundaries.  The  spatial  size  of  census 
tracts  varies  widely  depending  on  the  density  of  settle- 
ment. Census  tract  boundaries  are  delineated  with  the 
intention  of  being  maintained  over  a  long  time  so  that 
statistical  comparisons  can  be  made  from  census  to 
census.  However,  physical  changes  in  street  patterns 
caused  by  highway  construction,  new  development,  etc., 
may  require  occasional  revisions;  census  tracts  occasion- 
ally are  split  due  to  large  population  growth,  or  combined 
as  a  result  of  substantial  population  decline.  Census  tracts 
are  referred  to  as  "tracts"  in  all  1990  data  products. 

Census  tracts  are  identified  by  a  four-digit  basic  number 
and  may  have  a  two-digit  suffix;  for  example,  6059.02.  The 
decimal  point  separating  the  four-digit  basic  tract  number 
from  the  two-digit  suffix  is  shown  in  printed  reports,  in 
microfiche,  and  on  census  maps;  in  machine-readable 
files,  the  decimal  point  is  implied.  Many  census  tracts  do 
not  have  a  suffix;  in  such  cases,  the  suffix  field  is  left  blank 
in  all  data  products.  Leading  zeros  in  a  census  tract 
number  (for  example,  002502)  are  shown  only  on  machine- 
readable  files. 

Census  tract  numbers  range  from  0001  through  9499.99 
and  are  unique  within  a  county  (numbers  in  the  range  of 
9501  through  9989.99  denote  a  block  numbering  area). 
The  suffix  .99  identifies  a  census  tract  that  was  populated 
entirely  by  persons  aboard  one  or  more  civilian  or  military 
ships.  A  "crews-of-vessels"  census  tract  appears  on  cen- 
sus maps  only  as  an  anchor  symbol  with  its  census  tract 
number  (and  block  numbers  on  maps  showing  block 
numbers).  These  census  tracts  relate  to  the  ships  associ- 
ated with  the  onshore  census  tract  having  the  same 
four-digit  basic  number.  Suffixes  in  the  range  .80  through 
.98  usually  identify  census  tracts  that  either  were  revised 
or  were  created  during  the  1990  census  data  collection 
activities.  Some  of  these  revisions  may  have  resulted  in 
census  tracts  that  have  extremely  small  land  area  and  may 
have  little  or  no  population  or  housing.  For  data  analysis, 
such  a  census  tract  can  be  summarized  with  an  adjacent 
census  tract.

CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT  (CD) 

Congressional  districts  (CD's)  are  the  435  areas  from 
which  persons  are  elected  to  the  U.S.  House  of  Represen- 
tatives. After  the  apportionment  of  congressional  seats 
among  the  States,  based  on  census  population  counts, 
each  State  is  responsible  for  establishing  CD's  for  the 
purpose  of  electing  representatives.  Each  CD  is  to  be  as 
equal  in  population  to  all  other  CD's  in  the  State  as 
practicable,  based  on  the  decennial  census  counts. 

The  CD's  that  were  in  effect  on  January  1,  1990  were 
those  of  the  101st  Congress.  Data  on  the  101st  Congress 
appear  in  an  early  1990  census  data  product  (Summary 
Tape  File  1A).  The  CD's  of  the  101st  Congress  are  the 
same  as  those  in  effect  for  the  102nd  Congress.  CD's  of 
the  103rd  Congress,  reflecting  redistricting  based  on  the 
1990  census,  are  summarized  in  later  1990  data  products 
(STF's  ID  and  3D,  and  1990  CPH-4,  Population  and 
Housing  Ctiaracteristics  for  Congressional  Districts  of  the 
103rd  Congress  printed  reports). 

COUNTY 

The  primary  political  divisions  of  most  States  are  termed 
"counties."  In  Louisiana,  these  divisions  are  known  as 
"parishes."  In  Alaska,  which  has  no  counties,  the  county 
equivalents  are  the  organized  "boroughs"  and  the  "cen- 
sus areas"  that  are  delineated  for  statistical  purposes  by 
the  State  of  Alaska  and  the  Census  Bureau.  In  four  States 
(Maryland,  Missouri,  Nevada,  and  Virginia),  there  are  one 
or  more  cities  that  are  independent  of  any  county  organi- 
zation and  thus  constitute  primary  divisions  of  their  States. 
These  cities  are  known  as  "independent  cities"  and  are 
treated  as  equivalent  to  counties  for  statistical  purposes. 
That  part  of  Yellowstone  National  Park  in  Montana  is 
treated  as  a  county  equivalent.  The  District  of  Columbia 
has  no  primary  divisions,  and  the  entire  area  is  considered 
equivalent  to  a  county  for  statistical  purposes. 

Each  county  and  county  equivalent  is  assigned  a  three- 
digit  FIRS  code  that  is  unique  within  State.  These  codes 
are  assigned  in  alphabetical  order  of  county  or  county 
equivalent  within  State,  except  for  the  independent  cities, 
which  follow  the  listing  of  counties. 

COUNTY  SUBDIVISION 

County  subdivisions  are  the  primary  subdivisions  of 
counties  and  their  equivalents  for  the  reporting  of  decen- 
nial census  data.  They  include  census  county  divisions, 
census  subareas,  minor  civil  divisions,  and  unorganized 
territories. 

Each  county  subdivision  is  assigned  a  three-digit  cen- 
sus code  in  alphabetical  order  within  county  and  a  five-digit 
FIPS  code  in  alphabetical  order  within  State. 

Census  County  Division  (CCD) 

Census  county  divisions  (CCD's)  are  subdivisions  of  a 
county  that  were  delineated  by  the  Census  Bureau,  in 
cooperation  with  State  officials  and  local  census  statistical 


areas  committees,  for  statistical  purposes.  CCD's  were 
established  in  21  States  where  there  are  no  legally  estab- 
lished minor  civil  divisions  (MCD's),  where  the  MCD's  do 
not  have  governmental  or  administrative  purposes,  where 
the  boundaries  of  the  MCD's  change  frequently,  and/or 
where  the  MCD's  are  not  generally  known  to  the  public. 
CCD's  have  no  legal  functions,  and  are  not  governmental 
units. 

The  boundaries  of  CCD's  usually  are  delineated  to 
follow  visible  features,  and  in  most  cases  coincide  with 
census  tract  or  block  numbering  area  boundaries.  The 
name  of  each  CCD  is  based  on  a  place,  county,  or 
well-known  local  name  that  identifies  its  location.  CCD's 
have  been  established  in  the  following  21  States:  Ala- 
bama, Arizona,  California,  Colorado,  Delaware,  Florida, 
Georgia,  Hawaii,  Idaho,  Kentucky,  Montana,  Nevada,  New 
Mexico,  Oklahoma,  Oregon,  South  Carolina,  Tennessee, 
Texas,  Utah,  Washington,  and  Wyoming.  For  the  1980 
census,  the  county  subdivisions  recognized  for  Nevada 
were  MCD's. 

Census  Subarea  (Alaska) 

Census  subareas  are  statistical  subdivisions  of  bor- 
oughs and  census  areas  (county  equivalents)  in  Alaska. 
Census  subareas  were  delineated  cooperatively  by  the 
State  of  Alaska  and  the  Census  Bureau.  The  census 
subareas,  identified  first  in  1980,  replaced  the  various 
types  of  subdivisions  used  in  the  1970  census. 

Minor  Civil  Division  (MCD) 

Minor  civil  divisions  (MCD's)  are  the  primary  political  or 
administrative  divisions  of  a  county.  MCD's  represent 
many  different  kinds  of  legal  entities  with  a  wide  variety  of 
governmental  and/or  administrative  functions.  MCD's  are 
variously  designated  as  American  Indian  reservations, 
assessment  districts,  boroughs,  election  districts,  gores, 
grants,  magisterial  districts,  parish  governing  authority 
districts,  plantations,  precincts,  purchases,  supervisors' 
districts,  towns,  and  townships.  In  some  States,  all  or  some 
incorporated  places  are  not  located  in  any  MCD  and  thus 
serve  as  MCD's  in  their  own  right.  In  other  States,  incor- 
porated places  are  subordinate  to  (part  of)  the  MCD's  in 
which  they  are  located,  or  the  pattern  is  mixed— some 
incorporated  places  are  independent  of  MCD's  and  others 
are  subordinate  to  one  or  more  MCD's. 

The  Census  Bureau  recognizes  MCD's  in  the  following 
28  States:  Arkansas,  Connecticut,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Iowa, 
Kansas,  Louisiana,  Maine,  Maryland,  Massachusetts,  Mich- 
igan, Minnesota,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  Nebraska,  New 
Hampshire,  New  Jersey,  New  York,  North  Carolina,  North 
Dakota,  Ohio,  Pennsylvania,  Rhode  Island,  South  Dakota, 
Vermont,  Virginia,  West  Virginia,  and  Wisconsin.  The  Dis- 
trict of  Columbia  has  no  primary  divisions,  and  the  entire 
area  is  considered  equivalent  to  an  MCD  for  statistical 
purposes.

AREA  CLASSIFICATIONS 


The  MCD's  in  12  selected  States  (Connecticut,  Maine, 
Massachusetts,  Michigan,  Minnesota,  New  Hampshire, 
New  Jersey,  New  York,  Pennsylvania,  Rhode  Island,  Ver- 
mont, and  Wisconsin)  also  serve  as  general-purpose  local 
governments.  The  Census  Bureau  presents  data  for  these 
MCD's  in  all  data  products  in  which  it  provides  data  for 
places. 

Unorganized  Territory  (unorg.) 

In  nine  States  (Arkansas,  Iowa,  Kansas,  Louisiana, 
Maine,  Minnesota,  North  Carolina,  North  Dakota,  and 
South  Dakota),  some  counties  contain  territory  that  is  not 
included  in  an  MCD  recognized  by  the  Census  Bureau. 
Each  separate  area  of  unorganized  territory  in  these 
States  is  recognized  as  one  or  more  separate  county 
subdivisions  for  census  purposes.  Each  unorganized  terri- 
tory is  given  a  descriptive  name,  followed  by  the  designa- 
tion "unorg." 

GEOGRAPHIC  CODE 

Geographic  codes  are  shown  primarily  on  machine- 
readable  data  products,  such  as  computer  tape  and  com- 
pact disc-read  only  memory  (CD-ROM),  but  also  appear  on 
other  products  such  as  microfiche;  they  also  are  shown  on 
some  census  maps.  Codes  are  identified  as  "census 
codes"  only  if  there  is  also  a  Federal  Information  Process- 
ing Standards  (FIPS)  code  for  the  same  geographic  entity. 
A  code  that  is  not  identified  as  either  "census"  or  "FIPS" 
is  usually  a  census  code  for  which  there  is  no  FIPS 
equivalent,  or  for  which  the  Census  Bureau  does  not  use 
the  FIPS  code.  The  exceptions,  which  use  only  the  FIPS 
code  in  census  products,  are  county,  congressional  dis- 
trict, and  metropolitan  area  (that  is,  metropolitan  statistical 
area,  consolidated  metropolitan  statistical  area,  and  pri- 
mary metropolitan  statistical  area). 

Census  Code 

Census  codes  are  assigned  for  a  variety  of  geographic 
entities,  including  American  Indian  and  Alaska  Native  area, 
census  division,  census  region,  county  subdivision,  place, 
State,  urbanized  area,  and  voting  district.  The  structure, 
format,  and  meaning  of  census  codes  appear  in  the  1 990 
census  Geographic  Identification  Code  Sclieme;  in  the 
data  dictionary  portion  of  the  technical  documentation  for 
summary  tape  files,  CD-ROM's,  and  microfiche. 

Federal  Information  Processing  Standards 
(FIPS)  Code 

Federal  Information  Processing  Standards  (FIPS)  codes 
are  assigned  for  a  variety  of  geographic  entities,  including 
American  Indian  and  Alaska  Native  area,  congressional 
district,  county,  county  subdivision,  metropolitan  area,  place, 
and  State.  The  structure,  format,  and  meaning  of  FIPS 


codes  used  in  the  census  are  shown  in  the  1 990  census 
Geographic  Identification  Code  Scheme;  in  the  data  dic- 
tionary portion  of  the  technical  documentation  for  sum- 
mary tape  files,  CD-ROM's,  and  microfiche. 

The  objective  of  the  FIPS  codes  is  to  improve  the  use  of 
data  resources  of  the  Federal  Government  and  avoid 
unnecessary  duplication  and  incompatibilities  in  the  collec- 
tion, processing,  and  dissemination  of  data.  More  informa- 
tion about  FIPS  and  FIPS  code  documentation  is  available 
from  the  National  Technical  Information  Service,  Spring- 
field, VA  22161. 

United  States  Postal  Service  (USPS)  Code 

United  States  Postal  Service  (USPS)  codes  for  States 
are  used  in  all  1990  data  products.  The  codes  are  two- 
character  alphabetic  abbreviations.  These  codes  are  the 
same  as  the  FIPS  two-character  alphabetic  abbreviations. 

GEOGRAPHIC  PRESENTATION 

Hierarchical  Presentation 

A  hierarchical  geographic  presentation  shows  the  geo- 
graphic entities  in  a  superior/subordinate  structure  in 
census  products.  This  structure  is  derived  from  the  legal, 
administrative,  or  areal  relationships  of  the  entities.  The 
hierarchical  structure  is  depicted  in  report  tables  by  means 
of  indentation,  and  is  explained  for  machine-readable 
media  in  the  discussion  of  file  structure  in  the  geographic 
coverage  portion  of  the  abstract  in  the  technical  documen- 
tation. An  example  of  hierarchical  presentation  is  the 
"standard  census  geographic  hierarchy":  block,  within 
block  group,  within  census  tract  or  block  numbering  area, 
within  place,  within  county  subdivision,  within  county,  within 
State,  within  division,  within  region,  within  the  United 
States.  Graphically,  this  is  shown  as: 

United  States

Inventory  Presentation 

An  inventory  presentation  of  geographic  entities  is  one 
in  which  all  entities  of  the  same  type  are  shown  in 
alphabetical  or  code  sequence,  without  reference  to 
their  hierarchical  relationships.  Generally,  an  inventory 
presentation  shows  totals  for  entities  that  may  be  split 
in  a  hierarchical  presentation,  such  as  place,  census

tract/block  numbering  area,  or  block  group.  An  example  of 
a  series  of  inventory  presentations  is:  State,  followed  by  all 
the  counties  in  that  State,  followed  by  all  the  places  in  that 
State.  Graphically,  this  is  shown  as:

HISTORICAL  COUNTS 

Historical  counts  for  total  population  and  total  housing 
units  are  shown  in  the  1990  CPH-2,  Population  and 
Housing  Unit  Counts  report  series.  As  in  past  censuses, 
the  general  rule  for  presenting  historical  data  for  States, 
counties,  county  subdivisions,  and  places  is  to  show 
historical  counts  only  for  single,  continually  existing  enti- 
ties. Stated  another  way,  if  an  entity  existed  for  both  the 
current  and  preceding  censuses,  the  tables  show  counts 
for  the  preceding  censuses.  Included  in  this  category  are 
entities  of  the  same  type  (county,  county  subdivision, 
place)  even  if  they  had  changed  their  names.  Also  included 
are  entities  that  merged,  but  only  if  the  new  entity  retained 
the  name  of  one  of  the  merged  entities.  The  historical 
counts  shown  are  for  each  entity  as  it  was  bounded  at 
each  census. 

In  cases  where  an  entity  was  formed  since  a  preceding 
census,  such  as  a  newly  incorporated  place  or  a  newly 
organized  township,  the  symbol  three  dots  "..."  is  shown 
for  earlier  censuses.  The  three-dot  symbol  also  is  shown 
for  those  parts  of  a  place  that  have  extended  into  an 
additional  county  or  county  subdivision  through  annexation 
or  other  revision  of  boundaries  since  the  preceding  cen- 
sus. 

In  a  few  cases,  changes  in  the  boundaries  of  county 
subdivisions  caused  a  place  to  be  split  into  two  or  more 
parts,  or  to  be  split  differently  than  in  the  preceding  census. 
If  historical  counts  for  the  parts  of  the  place  as  currently 
split  did  not  appear  in  a  preceding  census,  "(NA)"  is  shown 
for  the  place  in  each  county  subdivision;  however,  the 
historical  population  and  housing  unit  counts  of  the  place 
appear  in  tables  that  show  the  entire  place.  For  counties, 
county  subdivisions,  and  places  formed  since  January  1, 
1980,  1980  census  population  and  housing  unit  counts  in 
the  1990  territory  are  reported  in  the  geographic  change 
notes  included  in  the  "User  Notes"  text  section  of  1990 
CPH-2,  Population  and  Housing  Unit  Counts,  and  in  the 
technical  documentation  of  Summary  Tape  Files  1  and  3. 

In  some  cases,  population  and  housing  unit  counts  for 
individual  areas  were  revised  since  publication  of  the  1 980 
reports  (indicated  by  the  prefix  "r").  In  a  number  of  tables 
of  1 990  CPH-2,  Population  and  Housing  Unit  Counts,  1 980 
counts  are  shown  for  aggregations  of  individual  areas. 


such  as  the  number,  population,  and  housing  unit  counts  of 
places  in  size  groups,  or  urban  and  rural  distributions. 
Revisions  of  population  and  housing  unit  counts  for  indi- 
vidual areas  were  not  applied  to  the  various  aggregations. 
Therefore,  it  may  not  be  possible  to  determine  the  individ- 
ual areas  in  a  given  aggregation  using  the  historical  counts;  ; 
conversely,  the  sum  of  the  counts  shown  for  individual 
areas  may  not  agree  with  the  aggregation. 

INTERNAL  POINT 

An  internal  point  is  a  set  of  geographic  coordinates 
(latitude  and  longitude)  that  is  located  within  a  specified 
geographic  entity.  A  single  point  is  identified  for  each 
entity;  for  many  entities,  this  point  represents  the  approx- 
imate geographic  center  of  that  entity.  If  the  shape  of  the 
entity  caused  this  point  to  be  located  outside  the  bound- 
aries of  the  entity,  it  is  relocated  from  the  center  so  that  it 
is  within  the  entity.  If  the  internal  point  for  a  block  falls  in  a 
water  area,  it  is  relocated  to  a  land  area  within  the  block. 
On  machine-readable  products,  internal  points  are  shown 
to  six  decimal  places;  the  decimal  point  is  implied. 

METROPOLITAN  AREA  (MA) 

The  general  concept  of  a  metropolitan  area  (MA)  is  one 
of  a  large  population  nucleus,  together  with  adjacent 
communities  that  have  a  high  degree  of  economic  and 
social  integration  with  that  nucleus.  Some  MA's  are  defined 
around  two  or  more  nuclei. 

The  MA  classification  is  a  statistical  standard,  devel- 
oped for  use  by  Federal  agencies  in  the  production, 
analysis,  and  publication  of  data  on  MA's.  The  MA's  are 
designated  and  defined  by  the  Federal  Office  of  Manage- 
ment and  Budget,  following  a  set  of  official  published 
standards.  These  standards  were  developed  by  the  inter- 
agency Federal  Executive  Committee  on  Metropolitan 
Areas,  with  the  aim  of  producing  definitions  that  are  as 
consistent  as  possible  for  all  MA's  nationwide. 

Each  MA  must  contain  either  a  place  with  a  minimum 
population  of  50,000  or  a  Census  Bureau-defined  urban- 
ized area  and  a  total  MA  population  of  at  least  100,000 
(75,000  in  New  England).  An  MA  comprises  one  or  more 
central  counties.  An  MA  also  may  include  one  or  more 
outlying  counties  that  have  close  economic  and  social 
relationships  with  the  central  county.  An  outlying  county 
must  have  a  specified  level  of  commuting  to  the  central 
counties  and  also  must  meet  certain  standards  regarding 
metropolitan  character,  such  as  population  density,  urban 
population,  and  population  growth.  In  New  England,  MA's 
are  composed  of  cities  and  towns  rather  than  whole 
counties. 

The  territory,  population,  and  housing  units  in  MA's  are 
referred  to  as  "metropolitan."  The  metropolitan  category  is 
subdivided  into  "inside  central  city"  and  "outside  central 
city."  The  territory,  population,  and  housing  units  located 
outside  MA's  are  referred  to  as  "nonmetropolitan."  The 


A-8 


AREA  CLASSIFICATIONS 


metropolitan  and  nonmetropolitan  classification  cuts  across 
the  other  hierarchies;  for  example,  there  is  generally  both 
urban  and  rural  territory  within  both  metropolitan  and 
nonmetropolitan  areas. 

To  meet  the  needs  of  various  users,  the  standards 
provide  for  a  flexible  structure  of  metropolitan  definitions 
that  classify  an  MA  either  as  a  metropolitan  statistical  area 

j  (MSA)  or  as  a  consolidated  metropolitan  statistical  area 
(CMSA)  that  is  divided  into  primary  metropolitan  statistical 
areas  (PMSA's).  Documentation  of  the  MA  standards  and 

j  how  they  are  applied  is  available  from  the  Secretary, 
Federal  Executive  Committee  on  Metropolitan  Areas,  Pop- 
ulation Division,  U.S.  Bureau  of  the  Census,  Washington, 
DC  20233. 

Central  City 

In  each  MSA  and  CMSA,  the  largest  place  and,  in  some 
cases,  additional  places  are  designated  as  "central  cities" 
under  the  official  standards.  A  few  PMSA's  do  not  have 
central  cities.  The  largest  central  city  and,  in  some  cases, 
up  to  two  additional  central  cities  are  included  in  the  title  of 
the  MA;  there  also  are  central  cities  that  are  not  included 
in  an  MA  title.  An  MA  central  city  does  not  include  any  part 
of  that  city  that  extends  outside  the  MA  boundary. 

Consolidated  and  Primary  Metropolitan 
Statistical  Area  (CMSA  and  PMSA) 

f' 

If  an  area  that  qualifies  as  an  MA  has  more  than  one 
million  persons,  primary  metropolitan  statistical  areas  (PMSA's) 
may  be  defined  within  it.  PMSA's  consist  of  a  large 
urbanized  county  or  cluster  of  counties  that  demonstrates 
very  strong  internal  economic  and  social  links,  in  addition 
to  close  ties  to  other  portions  of  the  larger  area.  When 
PMSA's  are  established,  the  larger  area  of  which  they  are 
component  parts  is  designated  a  consolidated  metropoli- 
tan statistical  area  (CMSA). 

Metropolitan  Statistical  Area  (MSA) 

Metropolitan  statistical  areas  (MSA's)  are  relatively  free- 
standing MA's  and  are  not  closely  associated  with  other 
MA's.  These  areas  typically  are  surrounded  by  nonmetro- 
politan counties. 

Metropolitan  Area  Title  and  Code 

The  title  of  an  MSA  contains  the  name  of  its  largest 
central  city  and  up  to  two  additional  city  names,  provided 
that  the  additional  places  meet  specified  levels  of  popula- 
tion, employment,  and  commuting.  Generally,  a  city  with  a 
population  of  250,000  or  more  is  in  the  title,  regardless  of 
other  criteria. 

The  title  of  a  PMSA  may  contain  up  to  three  place 
names,  as  determined  above,  or  up  to  three  county  names, 
sequenced  in  order  of  population.  A  CMSA  title  also  may 
include  up  to  three  names,  the  first  of  which  generally  is 


the  most  populous  central  city  in  the  area.  The  second 
name  may  be  the  first  city  or  county  name  in  the  most 
populous  remaining  PMSA;  the  third  name  may  be  the  first 
city  or  county  name  in  the  next  most  populous  PMSA.  A 
regional  designation  may  be  substituted  for  the  second 
and/or  third  names  in  a  CMSA  title  if  such  a  designation  is 
supported  by  local  opinion  and  is  deemed  to  be  unambig- 
uous and  suitable  by  the  Office  of  Management  and 
Budget. 

The  titles  for  all  MA's  also  contain  the  name  of  each 
State  in  which  the  area  is  located.  Each  metropolitan  area 
is  assigned  a  four-digit  FIPS  code,  in  alphabetical  order 
nationwide.  If  the  fourth  digit  of  the  code  is  a  "2,"  it 
identifies  a  CMSA.  Additionally,  there  is  a  separate  set  of 
two-digit  codes  for  CMSA's,  also  assigned  alphabetically. 


OUTLYING  AREAS  OF  THE  UNITED  STATES 

The  Census  Bureau  treats  the  outlying  areas  as  the 
statistical  equivalents  of  States  for  the  1 990  census.  The 
outlying  areas  are  American  Samoa,  Guam,  the  Common- 
wealth of  the  Northern  Mariana  Islands  (Northern  Mariana 
Islands),  Republic  of  Palau  (Palau),  Puerto  Rico,  and  the 
Virgin  Islands  of  the  United  States  (Virgin  Islands).  Geo- 
graphic definitions  specific  to  each  outlying  area  are 
shown  in  appendix  A  of  the  text  in  the  data  products  for 
each  area. 


PLACE 

Places,  for  the  reporting  of  decennial  census  data, 
include  census  designated  places  and  incorporated  places. 
Each  place  is  assigned  a  four-digit  census  code  that  is 
unique  within  State.  Each  place  is  also  assigned  a  five-digit 
FIPS  code  that  is  unique  within  State.  Both  the  census  and 
FIPS  codes  are  assigned  based  on  alphabetical  order 
within  State.  Consolidated  cities  (see  below)  are  assigned 
a  one-character  alphabetical  census  code  that  is  unique 
nationwide  and  a  five-digit  FIPS  code  that  is  unique  within 
State. 

Census  Designated  Place  (CDP) 

Census  designated  places  (CDP's)  are  delineated  for 
the  decennial  census  as  the  statistical  counterparts  of 
incorporated  places.  CDP's  comprise  densely  settled  con- 
centrations of  population  that  are  identifiable  by  name,  but 
are  not  legally  incorporated  places.  Their  boundaries, 
which  usually  coincide  with  visible  features  or  the  boundary 
of  an  adjacent  incorporated  place,  have  no  legal  status, 
nor  do  these  places  have  officials  elected  to  serve  tradi- 
tional municipal  functions.  CDP  boundaries  may  change 
with  changes  in  the  settlement  pattern;  a  CDP  with  the 
same  name  as  in  previous  censuses  does  not  necessarily 
have  the  same  boundaries.

A-9 


Beginning  with  the  1950  census,  the  Census  Bureau,  in 
cooperation  with  State  agencies  and  local  census  statisti- 
cal areas  committees,  has  identified  and  delineated  bound- 
aries for  CDP's.  In  the  1990  census,  the  name  of  each 
such  place  is  followed  by  "CDP."  In  the  1980  census, 
"(CDP)"  was  used;  in  1970,  1960,  and  1950  censuses, 
these  places  were  identified  by  "(U),"  meaning  "unincor- 
porated place." 

To  qualify  as  a  CDP  for  the  1990  census,  an  unincor- 
porated community  must  have  met  the  following  criteria: 

1.  In  all  States  except  Alaska  and  Hawaii,  the  Census 
Bureau  uses  three  population  size  criteria  to  designate 
a  CDP.  These  criteria  are: 

a.  1 ,000  or  more  persons  if  outside  the  boundaries  of 
an  urbanized  area  (UA)  delineated  for  the  1980 
census  or  a  subsequent  special  census. 

b.  2,500  or  more  persons  if  inside  the  boundaries  of 
a  UA  delineated  for  the  1 980  census  or  a  subse- 
quent special  census. 

c.  250  or  more  persons  if  outside  the  boundaries  of  a 
UA  delineated  for  the  1980  census  or  a  subse- 
quent special  census,  and  within  the  official  bound- 
aries of  an  American  Indian  reservation  recog- 
nized for  the  1990  census. 

2.  In  Alaska,  25  or  more  persons  if  outside  a  UA,  and 
2,500  or  more  persons  if  inside  a  UA  delineated  for  the 
1 980  census  or  a  subsequent  special  census. 

3.  In  Hawaii,  300  or  more  persons,  regardless  of  whether 
the  community  is  inside  or  outside  a  UA. 


continue  to  function  as  separate  governments,  even  though 
they  have  been  included  in  the  consolidated  government, 
the  primary  incorporated  place  is  referred  to  as  a  "consol- 
idated city." 

The  data  presentation  for  consolidated  cities  varies 
depending  upon  the  geographic  presentation.  In  hierarchi- 
cal presentations,  consolidated  cities  are  not  shown.  These 
presentations  include  the  semi-independent  places  and 
the  "consolidated  city  (remainder)."  Where  the  consoli-  , 
dated  city  is  coextensive  with  a  county  or  county  subdivi-  I 
sion,  the  data  shown  for  those  areas  in  hierarchical 
presentations  are  equivalent  to  those  for  the  consolidated 
government. 

For  inventory  geographic  presentations,  the  consoli- 
dated city  appears  at  the  end  of  the  listing  of  places.  The 
data  for  the  consolidated  city  include  places  that  are  part  ■ 
of  the  consolidated  city.  The  "consolidated  city  (remain-  | 
der)"  is  the  portion  of  the  consolidated  government  minus 
the  semi-independent  places,  and  is  shown  in  alphabetical 
sequence  with  other  places. 

In  summary  presentations  by  size  of  place,  the  consol- 
idated city  is  not  included.  The  places  semi-independent  of 
consolidated  cities  are  categorized  by  their  size,  as  is  the 
"consolidated  city  (remainder)." 

Each  consolidated  city  is  assigned  a  one-character 
alphabetic  census  code.  Each  consolidated  city  also  is 
assigned  a  five-digit  FIPS  code  that  is  unique  within  State. 
The  semi-independent  places  and  the  "consolidated  city 
(remainder)"  are  assigned  a  four-digit  census  code  and  a 
five-digit  FIPS  place  code  that  are  unique  within  State. 
Both  the  census  and  FIPS  codes  are  assigned  based  on 
alphabetical  order  within  State. 


For  the  1 990  census,  CDP's  qualified  on  the  basis  of  the 
population  counts  prepared  for  the  1 990  Postcensus  Local 
Review  Program.  Because  these  counts  were  subject  to 
change,  a  few  CDP's  may  have  final  population  counts 
lower  than  the  minimums  shown  above. 

Hawaii  is  the  only  State  with  no  incorporated  places 
recognized  by  the  Bureau  of  the  Census.  All  places  shown 
for  Hawaii  in  the  data  products  are  CDP's.  By  agreement 
with  the  State  of  Hawaii,  the  Census  Bureau  does  not  show 
data  separately  for  the  city  of  Honolulu,  which  is  coexten- 
sive with  Honolulu  County. 

Consolidated  City 

A  consolidated  government  is  a  unit  of  local  govern- 
ment for  which  the  functions  of  an  incorporated  place  and 
its  county  or  minor  civil  division  (MCD)  have  merged.  The 
legal  aspects  of  this  action  may  result  in  both  the  primary 
incorporated  place  and  the  county  or  MCD  continuing  to 
exist  as  legal  entities,  even  though  the  county  or  MCD 
performs  few  or  no  governmental  functions  and  has  few  or 
no  elected  officials.  Where  this  occurs,  and  where  one  or 
more  other  incorporated  places  in  the  county  or  MCD

Incorporated  Place 

Incorporated  places  recognized  in  1990  census  data 
products  are  those  reported  to  the  Census  Bureau  as 
legally  in  existence  on  January  1,  1990  under  the  laws  of 
their  respective  States  as  cities,  boroughs,  towns,  and 
villages,  with  the  following  exceptions:  the  towns  in  the 
New  England  States,  New  York,  and  Wisconsin,  and  the 
boroughs  in  New  York  are  recognized  as  minor  civil 
divisions  for  census  purposes;  the  boroughs  in  Alaska  are 
county  equivalents. 


POPULATION  OR  HOUSING  UNIT  DENSITY 

Population  or  housing  unit  density  is  computed  by 
dividing  the  total  population  or  housing  units  of  a  geo- 
graphic unit  (for  example.  United  States.  State,  county, 
place)  by  its  land  area  measured  in  square  kilometers  or 
square  miles.  Density  is  expressed  as  both  "persons  (or 
housing  units)  per  square  kilometer"  and  "persons  (or 
housing  units)  per  square  mile"  of  land  area  in  1990 
census  printed  reports.

STATE 

States  are  the  primary  governmental  divisions  of  the 
United  States.  The  District  of  Columbia  is  treated  as  a 
statistical  equivalent  of  a  State  for  census  purposes.  The 
four  census  regions,  nine  census  divisions,  and  their 
component  States  are  shown  under  "CENSUS  REGION 
AND  CENSUS  DIVISION"  in  this  appendix. 

The  Census  Bureau  treats  the  outlying  areas  as  State 
equivalents  for  the  1990  census.  The  outlying  areas  are 
American  Samoa,  Guam,  the  Northern  Mariana  Islands, 
Palau,  Puerto  Rico,  and  the  Virgin  Islands  of  the  United 
States.  Geographic  definitions  specific  to  each  outlying 
area  are  shown  in  appendix  A  in  the  data  products  for  each 
area. 

Each  State  and  equivalent  is  assigned  a  two-digit  numeric 
Federal  Information  Processing  Standards  (FIPS)  code  in 
alphabetical  order  by  State  name,  followed  by  the  outlying 
area  names.  Each  State  and  equivalent  area  also  is 
assigned  a  two-digit  census  code.  This  code  is  assigned 
on  the  basis  of  the  geographic  sequence  of  each  State 
within  each  census  division;  the  first  digit  of  the  code  is  the 
code  for  the  respective  division.  Puerto  Rico,  the  Virgin 
Islands,  and  the  outlying  areas  of  the  Pacific  are  assigned 
"0"  as  the  division  code.  Each  State  and  equivalent  area 
also  is  assigned  the  two-letter  FlPS/United  States  Postal 
Service  (USPS)  code. 

In  12  selected  States  (Connecticut,  Maine,  Massachu- 
setts, Michigan,  Minnesota,  New  Hampshire,  New  Jersey, 
New  York,  Pennsylvania,  Rhode  Island,  Vermont,  and 
Wisconsin),  the  minor  civil  divisions  also  serve  as  general- 
purpose  local  governments.  The  Census  Bureau  presents 
data  for  these  minor  civil  divisions  in  all  data  products  in 
which  it  provides  data  for  places. 

TIGER 

TIGER  is  an  acronym  for  the  new  digital  (computer- 
readable)  geographic  data  base  that  automates  the  map- 
ping and  related  geographic  activities  required  to  support 
the  Census  Bureau's  census  and  survey  programs.  The 
Census  Bureau  developed  the  Topologically  Integrated 
Geographic  Encoding  and  Referencing  (TIGER)  System  to 
automate  the  geographic  support  processes  needed  to 
meet  the  major  geographic  needs  of  the  1990  census: 
producing  the  cartographic  products  to  support  data  col- 
lection and  map  publication,  providing  the  geographic 
structure  for  tabulation  and  publication  of  the  collected 
data,  assigning  residential  and  employer  addresses  to  their 
geographic  location  and  relating  those  locations  to  the 
Census  Bureau's  geographic  units,  and  so  forth.  The 
content  of  the  TIGER  data  base  is  made  available  to  the 
public  through  a  variety  of  "TIGER  Extract"  files  that  may 
be  obtained  from  the  Data  User  Services  Division,  U.S. 
Bureau  of  the  Census,  Washington,  DC  20233. 

UNITED  STATES 

The  United  States  comprises  the  50  States  and  the 
District  of  Columbia.  In  addition,  the  Census  Bureau  treats 

AREA  CLASSIFICATIONS 


the  outlying  areas  as  statistical  equivalents  of  States  for 
the  1990  census.  The  outlying  areas  include  American 
Samoa,  Guam,  the  Northern  Mariana  Islands,  Palau,  Puerto 
Rico,  and  the  Virgin  Islands. 

URBAN  AND  RURAL 

The  Census  Bureau  defines  "urban"  for  the  1990 
census  as  comprising  all  territory,  population,  and  housing 
units  in  urbanized  areas  and  in  places  of  2,500  or  more 
persons  outside  urbanized  areas.  More  specifically,  "urban" 
consists  of  territory,  persons,  and  housing  units  in: 

1.  Places  of  2,500  or  more  persons  incorporated  as 
cities,  villages,  boroughs  (except  in  Alaska  and  New 
York),  and  towns  (except  in  the  six  New  England 
States,  New  York,  and  Wisconsin),  but  excluding  the 
rural  portions  of  "extended  cities." 

2.  Census  designated  places  of  2,500  or  more  persons. 

3.  Other  territory,  incorporated  or  unincorporated,  included 
in  urbanized  areas. 

Territory,  population,  and  housing  units  not  classified  as 
urban  constitute  "rural."  In  the  100-percent  data  products, 
"rural"  is  divided  into  "places  of  less  than  2,500"  and  "not 
in  places."  The  "not  in  places"  category  comprises  "rural" 
outside  incorporated  and  census  designated  places  and 
the  rural  portions  of  extended  cities.  In  many  data  prod- 
ucts, the  term  "other  rural"  is  used;  "other  rural"  is  a 
residual  category  specific  to  the  classification  of  the  rural  in 
each  data  product. 

In  the  sample  data  products,  rural  population  and  hous- 
ing units  are  subdivided  into  "rural  farm"  and  "rural 
nonfarm."  "Rural  farm"  comprises  all  rural  households 
and  housing  units  on  farms  (places  from  which  $1,000  or 
more  of  agricultural  products  were  sold  in  1989);  "rural 
nonfarm"  comprises  the  remaining  rural. 

The  urban  and  rural  classification  cuts  across  the  other 
hierarchies;  for  example,  there  is  generally  both  urban  and 
rural  territory  within  both  metropolitan  and  nonmetropolitan 
areas. 

In  censuses  prior  to  1950,  "urban"  comprised  all  terri- 
tory, persons,  and  housing  units  in  incorporated  places  of 
2,500  or  more  persons,  and  in  areas  (usually  minor  civil 
divisions)  classified  as  urban  under  special  rules  relating  to 
population  size  and  density.  The  definition  of  urban  that 
restricted  itself  to  incorporated  places  having  2,500  or 
more  persons  excluded  many  large,  densely  settled  areas 
merely  because  they  were  not  incorporated.  Prior  to  the 
1 950  census,  the  Census  Bureau  attempted  to  avoid  some 
of  the  more  obvious  omissions  by  classifying  selected 
areas  as  "urban  under  special  rules."  Even  with  these 
rules,  however,  many  large,  closely  built-up  areas  were 
excluded  from  the  urban  category. 

To  improve  its  measure  of  urban  territory,  population, 
and  housing  units,  the  Census  Bureau  adopted  the  con- 
cept of  the  urbanized  area  and  delineated  boundaries  for

for  the  1950  census.  Urban  was  defined  as  territory, 
persons,  and  housing  units  in  urbanized  areas  and,  outside 
urbanized  areas,  in  all  places,  incorporated  or  unincorpo- 
rated, that  had  2,500  or  more  persons.  With  the  following 
three  exceptions,  the  1950  census  definition  of  urban  has 
continued  substantially  unchanged.  First,  in  the  1960  cen- 
sus (but  not  in  the  1970,  1980,  or  1990  censuses),  certain 
towns  in  the  New  England  States,  townships  in  New 
Jersey  and  Pennsylvania,  and  Arlington  County,  Virginia, 
were  designated  as  urban.  However,  most  of  these  "spe- 
cial rule"  areas  would  have  been  classified  as  urban 
anyway  because  they  were  included  in  an  urbanized  area 
or  in  an  unincorporated  place  of  2,500  or  more  persons. 
Second,  "extended  cities"  were  identified  for  the  1970, 
1980,  and  1990  censuses.  Extended  cities  primarily  affect 
the  figures  for  urban  and  rural  territory  (area),  but  have  very 
little  effect  on  the  urban  and  rural  population  and  housing 
units  at  the  national  and  State  levels—  although  for  some 
individual  counties  and  urbanized  areas,  the  effects  have 
been  more  evident.  Third,  changes  since  the  1970  census 
in  the  criteria  for  defining  urbanized  areas  have  permitted 
these  areas  to  be  defined  around  smaller  centers. 

Documentation  of  the  urbanized  area  and  extended  city 
criteria  is  available  from  the  Chief,  Geography  Division, 
U.S.  Bureau  of  the  Census,  Washington,  DC  20233. 

Extended  City 

Since  the  1 960  census,  there  has  been  a  trend  in  some 
States  toward  the  extension  of  city  boundaries  to  include 
territory  that  is  essentially  rural  in  character.  The  classifi- 
cation of  all  the  population  and  living  quarters  of  such 
places  as  urban  would  include  in  the  urban  designation 
territory,  persons,  and  housing  units  whose  environment  is 
primarily  rural.  For  the  1970, 1980,  and  1990  censuses,  the 
Census  Bureau  identified  as  rural  such  territory  and  its 
population  and  housing  units  for  each  extended  city  whose 
closely  settled  area  was  located  in  an  urbanized  area.  For 
the  1 990  census,  this  classification  also  has  been  applied 
to  certain  places  outside  urbanized  areas. 

In  summary  presentations  by  size  of  place,  the  urban 
portion  of  an  extended  city  is  classified  by  the  population  of 
the  entire  place;  the  rural  portion  is  included  in  "other 
rural." 


URBANIZED  AREA  (UA) 

The  Census  Bureau  delineates  urbanized  areas  (UA's) 
to  provide  a  better  separation  of  urban  and  rural  territory, 
population,  and  housing  in  the  vicinity  of  large  places.  A  UA 
comprises  one  or  more  places  ("central  place")  and  the 
adjacent  densely  settled  surrounding  territory  ("urban  fringe") 
that  together  have  a  minimum  of  50,000  persons.  The 
urban  fringe  generally  consists  of  contiguous  territory 
having  a  density  of  least  1 ,000  persons  per  square  mile. 
The  urban  fringe  also  includes  outlying  territory  of  such 


density  if  it  was  connected  to  the  core  of  the  contiguous 
area  by  road  and  is  within  1  1  /2  road  miles  of  that  core,  or 
within  5  road  miles  of  the  core  but  separated  by  water  or 
other  undevelopable  territory.  Other  territory  with  a  popu- 
lation density  of  fewer  than  1 ,000  people  per  square  mile  is 
included  in  the  urban  fringe  if  it  eliminates  an  enclave  or 
closes  an  indentation  in  the  boundary  of  the  urbanized  ^ 
area.  The  population  density  is  determined  by  (1)  outside 
of  a  place,  one  or  more  contiguous  census  blocks  with  a 
population  density  of  at  least  1,000  persons  per  square 
mile  or  (2)  inclusion  of  a  place  containing  census  blocks 
that  have  at  least  50  percent  of  the  population  of  the  place 
and  a  density  of  at  least  1 ,000  persons  per  square  mile. 
The  complete  criteria  are  available  from  the  Chief,  Geog-  \ 
raphy  Division,  U.S.  Bureau  of  the  Census,  Washington, 
DC  20233. 

Urbanized  Area  Central  Place 

One  or  more  central  places  function  as  the  dominant 
centers  of  each  UA.  The  identification  of  a  UA  central 
place  permits  the  comparison  of  this  dominant  center  with 
the  remaining  territory  in  the  UA.  There  is  no  limit  on  the 
number  of  central  places,  and  not  all  central  places  are 
necessarily  included  in  the  UA  title.  UA  central  places 
include: 

1.  Each  place  entirely  (or  partially,  if  the  place  is  an 
extended  city)  within  the  UA  that  is  a  central  city  of  a 
metropolitan  area  (MA). 

2.  If  the  UA  does  not  contain  an  MA  central  city  or  Is 
located  outside  of  an  MA,  the  central  place(s)  is 
determined  by  population  size. 

Urbanized  Area  Title  and  Code 

The  title  of  a  UA  identifies  those  places  that  are  most 
important  within  the  UA;  it  links  the  UA  to  the  encompass- 
ing MA,  where  appropriate.  If  a  single  MA  includes  most  of 
the  UA,  the  title  and  code  of  the  UA  generally  are  the  same 
as  the  title  and  code  of  the  MA.  If  the  UA  is  not  mostly 
included  in  a  single  MA,  if  it  does  not  include  any  place  that 
is  a  central  city  of  the  encompassing  MA,  or  if  it  is  not 
located  in  an  MA,  the  Census  Bureau  uses  the  population 
size  of  the  included  places,  with  a  preference  for  incorpo- 
rated places,  to  determine  the  UA  title.  The  name  of  each 
State  in  which  the  UA  is  located  also  is  in  each  UA  title. 

The  numeric  code  used  to  identify  each  UA  is  the  same 
as  the  code  for  the  mostly  encompassing  MA  (including 
CMSA  and  PMSA).  If  MA  title  cities  represent  multiple 
UA's,  or  the  UA  title  city  does  not  correspond  to  the  first 
name  of  an  MA  title,  the  Census  Bureau  assigns  a  code 
based  on  the  alphabetical  sequence  of  the  UA  title  in 
relationship  to  the  other  UA  and  MA  titles. 

VOTING  DISTRICT  (VTD) 

A  voting  district  (VTD)  is  any  of  a  variety  of  types  of 
areas  (for  example,  election  districts,  precincts,  wards, 
legislative  districts)  established  by  State  and  local  govern- 
ments for  purposes  of  elections.  For  census  purposes.

AREA  CLASSIFICATIONS 


each  State  participating  in  Phase  2  of  the  1990  Census 
Redistricting  Data  Program  outlined  the  boundaries  of 
VTD's  around  groups  of  whole  census  blocks  on  census 
maps.  The  entities  identified  as  VTD's  are  not  necessarily 
those  legally  or  currently  established.  Also,  to  meet  the 
"whole  block"  criterion,  a  State  may  have  had  to  adjust 
VTD  boundaries  to  nearby  block  boundaries.  Therefore, 
the  VTD's  shown  on  the  1 990  census  tapes,  listings,  and 
maps  may  not  represent  the  actual  VTD's  in  effect  at  the 
time  of  the  census.  In  the  1980  census,  VTD's  were 
referred  to  as  "election  precincts." 

Each  VTD  is  assigned  a  four-character  alphanumeric 
code  that  is  unique  within  each  county.  The  code  "ZZZZ" 
is  assigned  to  nonparticipating  areas;  the  Census  Bureau 
reports  data  for  areas  coded  "ZZZZ." 


ZIP  CODE® 

ZIP  Codes  are  administrative  units  established  by  the 
United  States  Postal  Service  (USPS)  for  the  distribution  of 
mail.  ZIP  Codes  serve  addresses  for  the  most  efficient 
delivery  of  mail,  and  therefore  generally  do  not  respect 
political  or  census  statistical  area  boundaries.  ZIP  Codes 
usually  do  not  have  clearly  identifiable  boundaries,  often 
serve  a  continually  changing  area,  are  changed  periodi- 
cally to  meet  postal  requirements,  and  do  not  cover  all  the 
land  area  of  the  United  States.  ZIP  Codes  are  identified  by 
five-digit  codes  assigned  by  the  USPS.  The  first  three  digits 
identify  a  major  city  or  sectional  distribution  center,  and  the 
last  two  digits  generally  signify  a  specific  post  office's 
delivery  area  or  point.  For  the  1 990  census,  ZIP  Code  data 
are  tabulated  for  the  five-digit  codes  in  STF  3B.

POPULATION  CHARACTERISTICS 
AGE 

The  data  on  age  were  derived  from  answers  to  ques- 
tionnaire item  5,  whlcii  was  asked  of  all  persons.  The  age 
classification  is  based  on  the  age  of  the  person  in  com- 
plete years  as  of  April  1,  1990.  The  age  response  in 
question  5a  was  used  normally  to  represent  a  person's 
age.  However,  when  the  age  response  was  unacceptable 
or  unavailable,  a  person's  age  was  derived  from  an  accept- 
able year-of-birth  response  in  question  5b. 

Data  on  age  are  used  to  determine  the  applicability  of 
other  questions  for  a  person  and  to  classify  other  charac- 
teristics in  census  tabulations.  Age  data  are  needed  to 
interpret  most  social  and  economic  characteristics  used  to 
plan  and  examine  many  programs  and  policies.  Therefore, 
age  is  tabulated  by  single  years  of  age  and  by  many 
different  groupings,  such  as  5-year  age  groups. 

Some  tabulations  are  shown  by  the  age  of  the  house- 
holder. These  data  were  derived  from  the  age  responses 
for  each  householder.  (For  more  information  on  house- 
holder, see  the  discussion  under  "Household  Type  and 
Relationship.") 

Median  Age— This  measure  divides  the  age  distribution 
into  two  equal  parts:  one-half  of  the  cases  falling  below  the 
median  value  and  one-half  above  the  value.  Generally, 
median  age  is  computed  on  the  basis  of  more  detailed  age 
intervals  than  are  shown  in  some  census  publications; 
thus,  a  median  based  on  a  less  detailed  distribution  may 
differ  slightly  from  a  corresponding  median  for  the  same 
population  based  on  a  more  detailed  distribution.  (For 
more  information  on  medians,  see  the  discussion  under 
"Derived  Measures.") 

Limitation  of  tlie  Data— Counts  in  1970  and  1980  for 
persons  1 00  years  old  and  over  were  substantially  over- 
stated. Improvements  were  made  in  the  questionnaire 
design,  in  the  allocation  procedures,  and  to  the  respondent 
instruction  guide  to  attempt  to  minimize  this  problem  for 
the  1990  census. 


Review  of  detailed  1990  census  information  indicated 
that  respondents  tended  to  provide  their  age  as  of  the  date 
of  completion  of  the  questionnaire,  not  their  age  as  of  April 
1,  1990.  In  addition,  there  may  have  been  a  tendency  for 
respondents  to  round  their  age  up  if  they  were  close  to 
having  a  birthday.  It  is  likely  that  approximately  10  percent 
of  persons  in  most  age  groups  are  actually  1  year  younger. 
For  most  single  years  of  age,  the  misstatements  are 
largely  offsetting.  The  problem  is  most  pronounced  at 
age  0  because  persons  lost  to  age  1  may  not  have  been 
fully  offset  by  the  inclusion  of  babies  born  after  April  1, 
1990,  and  because  there  may  have  been  more  rounding 
up  to  age  1  to  avoid  reporting  age  as  0  years.  (Age  in 
complete  months  was  not  collected  for  infants  under 
age  1 .) 

The  reporting  of  age  1  year  older  than  age  on  April  1 , 
1990,  is  likely  to  have  been  greater  in  areas  where  the 
census  data  were  collected  later  in  1 990.  The  magnitude 
of  this  problem  was  much  less  in  the  three  previous 
censuses  where  age  was  typically  derived  from  respond- 
ent data  on  year  of  birth  and  quarter  of  birth.  (For  more 
information  on  the  design  of  the  age  question,  see  the 
section  below  that  discusses  "Comparability.") 

Comparability — Age  data  have  been  collected  in  every 
census.  For  the  first  time  since  1 950,  the  1 990  data  are  not 
available  by  quarter  year  of  age.  This  change  was  made  so 
that  coded  information  could  be  obtained  for  both  age  and 
year  of  birth.  In  each  census  since  1940,  the  age  of  a 
person  was  assigned  when  it  was  not  reported.  In  cen- 
suses before  1 940,  with  the  exception  of  1 880,  persons  of 
unknown  age  were  shown  as  a  separate  category.  Since 
1960,  assignment  of  unknown  age  has  been  performed  by 
a  general  procedure  described  as  "imputation."  The  spe- 
cific procedures  for  imputing  age  have  been  different  in 
each  census.  (For  more  information  on  imputation,  see 
Appendix  C,  Accuracy  of  the  Data.) 

ANCESTRY 

The  data  on  ancestry  were  derived  from  answers  to 
questionnaire  item  13,  which  was  asked  of  a  sample  of 
persons.  The  question  was  based  on  self-identification;  the 
data  on  ancestry  represent  self-classification  by  people 
according  to  the  ancestry  group(s)  with  which  they  most 
closely  identify.  Ancestry  refers  to  a  person's  ethnic  origin 
or  descent,  "roots,"  or  heritage  or  the  place  of  birth  of  the 
person  or  the  person's  parents  or  ancestors  before  their 
arrival  in  the  United  States.  Some  ethnic  identities,  such  as 
"Egyptian"  or  "Polish"  can  be  traced  to  geographic  areas 
outside  the  United  States,  while  other  ethnicities  such  as 
"Pennsylvania  Dutch"  or  "Cajun"  evolved  in  the  United 
States. 

The  intent  of  the  ancestry  question  was  not  to  measure 
the  degree  of  attachment  the  respondent  had  to  a  partic- 
ular ethnicity.  For  example,  a  response  of  "Irish"  might 
reflect  total  involvement  in  an  "Irish"  community  or  only  a 
memory  of  ancestors  several  generations  removed  from 
the  individual. 


B-2 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


The  Census  Bureau  coded  the  responses  through  an 
automated  review,  edit,  and  coding  operation.  The  open- 
ended  write-in  ancestry  item  was  coded  by  subject-matter 
specialists  into  a  numeric  representation  using  a  code  list 
containing  over  1,000  categories.  The  1990  code  list 
reflects  the  results  of  the  Census  Bureau's  own  research 
and  consultations  with  many  ethnic  experts.  Many  deci- 
sions were  made  to  determine  the  classification  of  responses. 
These  decisions  affected  the  grouping  of  the  tabulated 
data.  For  example,  the  "Assyrian"  category  includes  both 
responses  of  "Assyrian"  and  "Chaldean." 

The  ancestry  question  allowed  respondents  to  report 
one  or  more  ancestry  groups.  While  a  large  number  of 
respondents  listed  a  single  ancestry,  the  majority  of  answers 
included  more  than  one  ethnic  entry.  Generally,  only  the 
first  two  responses  reported  were  coded  in  1990.  If  a 
response  was  in  terms  of  a  dual  ancestry,  for  example, 
Irish-English,  the  person  was  assigned  two  codes,  in  this 
case  one  for  Irish  and  another  for  English. 

However,  in  certain  cases,  multiple  responses  such  as 
"French  Canadian,"  "Scotch-Irish,"  "Greek  Cypriote,"  and 
"Black  Dutch"  were  assigned  a  single  code  reflecting  their 
status  as  unique  groups.  If  a  person  reported  one  of  these 
unique  groups  in  addition  to  another  group,  for  example, 
"Scotch-Irish  English,"  resulting  in  three  terms,  that  per- 
son received  one  code  for  the  unique  group  ("Scotch- 
Irish")  and  another  one  for  the  remaining  group  ("English"). 
If  a  person  reported  "English  Irish  French,"  only  English 
and  Irish  were  coded.  Certain  combinations  of  ancestries 
where  the  ancestry  group  is  a  part  of  another,  such  as 
"German-Bavarian,"  the  responses  were  coded  as  a  sin- 
gle ancestry  using  the  smaller  group  ("Bavarian").  Also, 
responses  such  as  "Polish-American"  or  "Italian-American" 
were  coded  and  tabulated  as  a  single  entry  ("Polish"  or 
"Italian"). 

The  Census  Bureau  accepted  "American"  as  a  unique 
ethnicity  if  it  was  given  alone,  with  an  ambiguous  response, 
or  with  State  names.  If  the  respondent  listed  any  other 
ethnic  identity  such  as  "Italian  American,"  generally  the 
"American"  portion  of  the  response  was  not  coded.  How- 
ever, distinct  groups  such  as  "American  Indian,"  "Mexican 
American,"  and  "African  Amehcan"  were  coded  and  iden- 
tified separately  because  they  represented  groups  who 
considered  themselves  different  from  those  who  reported 
as  "Indian,"  "Mexican,"  or  "African,"  respectively. 

In  all  tabulations,  when  respondents  provided  an  unac- 
ceptable ethnic  identity  (for  example,  an  uncodeable  or 
unintelligible  response  such  as  "multi-national,"  "adopted," 
or  "I  have  no  idea"),  the  answer  was  included  in  "Ancestry 
not  reported." 

The  tabulations  on  ancestry  are  presented  using  two 
types  of  data  presentations— one  used  total  persons  as 
the  base,  and  the  other  used  total  responses  as  the  base. 
The  following  are  categories  shown  in  the  two  data  pre- 
sentations: 

Presentation  Based  on  Persons: 

Single  Ancestries  Reported— \nc\udes  all  persons 

who  reported  only  one  ethnic  group.  Included  in  this 


category  are  persons  with  multiple-term  responses 
such  as  "Scotch-Irish"  who  are  assigned  a  single 
code. 

l\/lultiple  Ancestries  Reported— \nc\u6es  all  persons 
who  reported  more  than  one  group  and  were  assigned 
two  ancestry  codes. 

Ancestry  Unciassified—\r]c\udes  all  persons  who  pro- 
vided a  response  that  could  not  be  assigned  an 
ancestry  code  because  they  provided  nonsensical 
entries  or  religious  responses. 

Presentations  Based  on  Responses: 

Total  Ancestries  Reported— \nc\udes  the  total  num- 
ber of  ancestries  reported  and  coded.  If  a  person 
reported  a  multiple  ancestry  such  as  "French  Dan- 
ish," that  response  was  counted  twice  in  the  tabula- 
tions—once in  the  "French"  category  and  again  in 
the  "Danish"  category.  Thus,  the  sum  of  the  counts 
in  this  type  of  presentation  is  not  the  total  population 
but  the  total  of  all  responses. 

First  Ancestry  Reported— \nc\udes  the  first  response 
of  all  persons  who  reported  at  least  one  codeable 
entry.  For  example,  in  this  category,  the  count  for 
"Danish"  would  include  all  those  who  reported  only 
Danish  and  those  who  reported  Danish  first  and  then 
some  other  group. 

Second  Ancestry  Reported— \nc\udes  the  second 
response  of  all  persons  who  reported  a  multiple 
ancestry.  Thus,  the  count  for  "Danish"  in  this  cate- 
gory includes  all  persons  who  reported  Danish  as  the 
second  response,  regardless  of  the  first  response 
provided. 

The  Census  Bureau  identified  hundreds  of  ethnic  groups 
in  the  1990  census.  However,  it  was  impossible  to  show 
information  for  every  group  in  all  census  tabulations  because 
of  space  constraints.  Publications  such  as  the  1990  CP-2, 
Social  and  Economic  Characteristics  and  the  1990  CPH-3, 
Population  and  Housing  Characteristics  for  Census  Tracts 
and  Block  Numbering  Areas  reports  show  a  limited  number 
of  groups  based  on  the  number  reported  and  the  advice 
received  from  experts.  A  more  complete  distribution  of 
groups  is  presented  in  the  1990  Summary  Tape  File  4, 
supplementary  reports,  and  a  special  subject  report  on 
ancestry.  In  addition,  groups  identified  specifically  in  the 
questions  on  race  and  Hispanic  origin  (for  example,  Japa- 
nese, Laotian,  Mexican,  Cuban,  and  Spaniard),  in  general, 
are  not  shown  separately  in  ancestry  tabulations. 

Limitation  of  tlie  Data— Although  some  experts  consider 
religious  affiliation  a  component  of  ethnic  identity,  the 
ancestry  question  was  not  designed  to  collect  any  infor- 
mation concerning  religion.  The  Bureau  of  the  Census  is 
prohibited  from  collecting  information  on  religion.  Thus,  if  a 
religion  was  given  as  an  answer  to  the  ancestry  question, 
it  was  coded  as  an  "Other"  response.

Comparability— A  question  on  ancestry  was  first  asked  in 
the  1 980  census.  Although  there  were  no  connparable  data 
prior  to  the  1980  census,  related  information  on  ethnicity 
was  collected  through  questions  on  parental  birthplace, 
own  birthplace,  and  language  which  were  included  in 
previous  censuses.  Unlike  other  census  questions,  there 
was  no  imputation  for  nonresponse  to  the  ancestry  ques- 
tion. 

In  1990,  respondents  were  allowed  to  report  more  than 
one  ancestry  group;  however,  only  the  first  two  ancestry 
groups  identified  were  coded.  In  1980,  the  Census  Bureau 
attempted  to  code  a  third  ancestry  for  selected  triple- 
ancestry  responses. 

New  categories  such  as  "Arab"  and  "West  Indian" 
were  added  to  the  1990  question  to  meet  important  data 
needs.  The  "West  Indian"  category  excluded  "Hispanic" 
groups  such  as  "Puerto  Rican"  and  "Cuban"  that  were 
identified  primarily  through  the  question  on  Hispanic  origin, 
in  1990,  the  ancestry  group,  "American"  is  recognized  and 
tabulated  as  a  unique  ethnicity.  In  1980,  "American"  was 
tabulated  but  included  under  the  category  "Ancestry  not 
specified." 

A  major  improvement  in  the  1 990  census  was  the  use  of 
an  automated  coding  system  for  ancestry  responses.  The 
automated  coding  system  used  in  the  1990  census  greatly 
reduced  the  potential  for  error  associated  with  a  clerical 
review.  Specialists  with  a  thorough  knowledge  of  the 
subject  matter  reviewed,  edited,  coded,  and  resolved 
inconsistent  or  incomplete  responses. 

CITIZENSHIP 

The  data  on  citizenship  were  derived  from  answers  to 
questionnaire  item  9,  which  was  asked  of  a  sample  of 
persons. 

Citizen— Persons  who  indicated  that  they  were  native- 
born  and  foreign-born  persons  who  indicated  that  they 
have  become  naturalized.  (For  more  information  on  native 
and  foreign  born,  see  the  discussion  under  "Place  of 
Birth.") 

There  are  four  categories  of  citizenship:  (1)  born  in  the 
United  States,  (2)  born  in  Puerto  Rico,  Guam,  the  Virgin 
Islands  of  the  United  States,  or  the  Commonwealth  of  the 
Northern  Mariana  Islands,  (3)  born  abroad  of  American 
parents,  and  (4)  citizen  by  naturalization. 

Naturalized  C///zen— Foreign-born  persons  who  had 
completed  the  naturalization  process  at  the  time  of 
the  census  and  upon  whom  the  rights  of  citizenship 
had  been  conferred. 

Not  a  Citizen— Foreign-born  persons  who  were  not  citi- 
zens, including  persons  who  had  begun  but  not  completed 
the  naturalization  process  at  the  time  of  the  census. 


Limitation  of  the  Data— Evaluation  studies  completed 
after  previous  censuses  indicated  that  some  persons  may 
have  reported  themselves  as  citizens  although  they  had 
not  yet  attained  the  status. 

Comparability — Similar  questions  on  citizenship  were  asked 
in  the  censuses  of  1820,  1830,  1870,  1890  through  1950, 
1 970,  and  1 980.  The  1 980  question  was  asked  of  a  sample 
of  the  foreign-born  population.  In  1990,  both  native  and 
foreign-born  persons  who  received  the  long-form  question- 
naire were  asked  to  respond  to  the  citizenship  question. 

EDUCATIONAL  ATTAINMENT 

Data  on  educational  attainment  were  derived  from 
answers  to  questionnaire  item  12,  which  was  asked  of  a 
sample  of  persons.  Data  are  tabulated  as  attainment  for 
persons  15  years  old  and  over.  Persons  are  classified 
according  to  the  highest  level  of  school  completed  or  the 
highest  degree  received.  The  question  included  instruc- 
tions to  report  the  level  of  the  previous  grade  attended  or 
the  highest  degree  received  for  persons  currently  enrolled 
in  school.  The  question  included  response  categories 
which  allowed  persons  to  report  completing  the  1 2th  grade 
without  receiving  a  high  school  diploma,  and  which  instructed 
respondents  to  report  as  "high  school  graduate(s)" — per- 
sons who  received  either  a  high  school  diploma  or  the 
equivalent,  for  example,  passed  the  Test  of  General 
Educational  Development  (G.E.D.),  and  did  not  attend 
college.  (On  the  Military  Census  Report  questionnaire,  the 
lowest  response  category  was  "Less  than  9th  grade.") 

Instructions  included  in  the  1990  respondent  instruction 
guide,  which  was  mailed  with  the  census  questionnaire, 
further  specified  that  schooling  completed  in  foreign  or 
ungraded  school  systems  should  be  reported  as  the 
equivalent  level  of  schooling  in  the  regular  American 
system;  that  vocational  certificates  or  diplomas  from  voca- 
tional, trade,  or  business  schools  or  colleges  were  not  to 
be  reported  unless  they  were  college  level  degrees;  and 
that  honorary  degrees  were  not  to  be  reported.  The 
instructions  gave  "medicine,  dentistry,  chiropractic,  optom- 
etry, osteopathic  medicine,  pharmacy,  podiatry,  veterinary 
medicine,  law,  and  theology"  as  examples  of  professional 
school  degrees,  and  specifically  excluded  "barber  school, 
cosmetology,  or  other  training  for  a  specific  trade"  from 
the  professional  school  category.  The  order  in  which  they  , 
were  listed  suggested  that  doctorate  degrees  were  "higher" 
than  professional  school  degrees,  which  were  "higher" 
than  master's  degrees. 

Persons  who  did  not  report  educational  attainment  were  - 
assigned  the  attainment  of  a  person  of  the  same  age,  race 
or  Spanish  origin,  and  sex  who  resided  in  the  same  or  a 
nearby  area.  Persons  who  filled  more  than  one  circle  were 
edited  to  the  highest  level  or  degree  reported. 

High  Schooi  Graduate  or  Higher— \nc\\jdes  persons 
whose  highest  degree  was  a  high  school  diploma  or 


B-4 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


its  equivalent,  persons  who  attended  college  or  pro- 
fessional school,  and  persons  who  received  a  col- 
lege, university,  or  professional  degree.  Persons  who 
reported  completing  the  12th  grade  but  not  receiving 
a  diploma  are  not  included. 

Not  Enrolled,  Not  High  School  Graduate— \nc\u6es 
persons  of  compulsory  school  attendance  age  or 
above  who  were  not  enrolled  in  school  and  were  not 
high  school  graduates;  these  persons  may  be  taken 
to  be  "high  school  dropouts."  There  is  no  restriction 
on  when  they  "dropped  out"  of  school,  and  they  may 
have  never  attended  high  school. 

In  prior  censuses,  "Median  school  years  completed" 
was  used  as  a  summary  measure  of  educational  attain- 
ment. In  1990,  the  median  can  only  be  calculated  for 
groups  of  which  less  than  half  the  members  have  attended 
college.  "Percent  high  school  graduate  or  higher"  and 
"Percent  bachelor's  degree  or  higher"  are  summary  mea- 
sures which  can  be  calculated  from  the  present  data  and 
offer  quite  readily  interpretable  measures  of  differences 
between  population  subgroups.  To  make  comparisons 
over  time,  "Percent  high  school  graduate  or  higher"  can  be 
calculated  and  "Percent  bachelor's  degree  or  higher"  can 
be  approximated  with  data  from  previous  censuses. 

Comparability— From  1840  to  1930,  the  census  mea- 
sured educational  attainment  by  means  of  a  basic  literacy 
question.  In  1940,  a  single  question  was  asked  on  highest 
grade  of  school  completed.  In  the  censuses  of  1950 
through  1 980,  a  two-part  question  asking  highest  grade  of 
school  attended  and  whether  that  grade  was  finished  was 
used  to  construct  highest  grade  or  year  of  school  com- 
pleted. For  persons  who  have  not  attended  college,  the 
response  categories  in  the  1990  educational  attainment 
question  should  produce  data  which  are  comparable  to 
data  on  highest  grade  completed  from  earlier  censuses. 
The  response  categories  for  persons  who  have  attended 
college  were  modified  from  earlier  censuses  because 
there  was  some  ambiguity  in  interpreting  responses  in 
terms  of  the  number  of  years  of  college  completed.  For 
instance,  it  was  not  clear  whether  "completed  the  fourth 
year  of  college,"  "completed  the  senior  year  of  college," 
and  "college  graduate"  were  synonymous.  Research  con- 
ducted shortly  before  the  census  suggests  that  these 
terms  were  more  distinct  in  1 990  than  in  earlier  decades, 
and  this  change  may  have  threatened  the  ability  to  esti- 
mate the  number  of  "college  graduates"  from  the  number 
of  persons  reported  as  having  completed  the  fourth  or  a 
higher  year  of  college.  It  was  even  more  difficult  to  make 
inferences  about  post-baccalaureate  degrees  and  "Asso- 
ciate" degrees  from  highest  year  of  college  completed. 
Thus,  comparisons  of  post-secondary  educational  attain- 
ment in  this  and  earlier  censuses  should  be  made  with 
great  caution. 

I  In  the  1960  and  subsequent  censuses,  persons  for 
whom  educational  attainment  was  not  reported  were  assigned 
the  same  attainment  level  as  a  similar  person  whose 

DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


residence  was  in  the  same  or  a  nearby  area.  In  the  1940 
and  1950  censuses,  persons  for  whom  educational  attain- 
ment was  not  reported  were  not  allocated. 

EMPLOYMENT  STATUS 

The  data  on  employment  status  were  derived  from 
answers  to  questionnaire  items  21 ,  25,  and  26,  which  were 
asked  of  a  sample  of  persons.  The  series  of  questions  on 
employment  status  was  asked  of  all  persons  15  years  old 
and  over  and  was  designed  to  identify,  in  this  sequence: 
(1)  persons  who  worked  at  any  time  during  the  reference 
week;  (2)  persons  who  did  not  work  during  the  reference 
week  but  who  had  jobs  or  businesses  from  which  they 
were  temporarily  absent  (excluding  layoff);  (3)  persons  on 
layoff;  and  (4)  persons  who  did  not  work  during  the 
reference  week,  but  who  were  looking  for  work  during  the 
last  four  weeks  and  were  available  for  work  during  the 
reference  week.  (For  more  information,  see  the  discussion 
under  "Reference  Week.") 

The  employment  status  data  shown  in  this  and  other 
1990  census  tabulations  relate  to  persons  16  years  old 
and  over.  Some  tabulations  showing  employment  status, 
however,  include  persons  15  years  old.  By  definition,  these 
persons  are  classified  as  "Not  in  Labor  Force.".  In  the 
1940,  1950,  and  1960  censuses,  employment  status  data 
were  presented  for  persons  14  years  old  and  over.  The 
change  in  the  universe  was  made  in  1 970  to  agree  with  the 
official  measurement  of  the  labor  force  as  revised  in 
January  1967  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Labor.  The  1970 
census  was  the  last  to  show  employment  data  for  persons 
14  and  15  years  old. 

Employed— All  civilians  16  years  old  and  over  who  were 
either  (1)  "at  work"— those  who  did  any  work  at  all  during 
the  reference  week  as  paid  employees,  worked  in  their 
own  business  or  profession,  worked  on  their  own  farm,  or 
worked  15  hours  or  more  as  unpaid  workers  on  a  family 
farm  or  in  a  family  business;  or  (2)  were  "with  a  job  but  not 
at  work"— those  who  did  not  work  during  the  reference 
week  but  had  jobs  or  businesses  from  which  they  were 
temporarily  absent  due  to  illness,  bad  weather,  industrial 
dispute,  vacation,  or  other  personal  reasons.  Excluded 
from  the  employed  are  persons  whose  only  activity  con- 
sisted of  work  around  the  house  or  unpaid  volunteer  work 
for  religious,  charitable,  and  similar  organizations;  also 
excluded  are  persons  on  active  duty  in  the  United  States 
Armed  Forces. 

Unemployed— All  civilians  16  years  old  and  over  are 
classified  as  unemployed  if  they  (1)  were  neither  "at  work" 
nor  "with  a  job  but  not  at  work"  during  the  reference  week, 
and  (2)  were  looking  for  work  during  the  last  4  weeks,  and 
(3)  were  available  to  accept  a  job.  Also  included  as 
unemployed  are  civilians  who  did  not  work  at  all  during  the 
reference  week  and  were  waiting  to  be  called  back  to  a  job 
from  which  they  had  been  laid  off.  Examples  of  job  seeking 
activities  are: 


B-5 


•  Registering  at  a  public  or  private  employment  office 

•  Meeting  with  prospective  employers 

•  Investigating  possibilities  for  starting  a  professional 
practice  or  opening  a  business 

•  Placing  or  answering  advertisements 

•  Writing  letters  of  application 

•  Being  on  a  union  or  professional  register 

Civiiian  Labor  Force— Consists  of  persons  classified  as 
employed  or  unemployed  in  accordance  with  the  criteria 
described  above. 

Experienced  Unemployed— These  are  unemployed  per- 
sons who  have  worked  at  any  time  in  the  past. 

Experienced  Civilian  Labor  Force— Consists  of  the  employed 
and  the  experienced  unemployed. 

Labor  Force— All  persons  classified  in  the  civilian  labor 
force  plus  members  of  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces  (persons  on 
active  duty  with  the  United  States  Army,  Air  Force,  Navy, 
Marine  Corps,  or  Coast  Guard). 

Not  in  Labor  Force— All  persons  16  years  old  and  over 
who  are  not  classified  as  members  of  the  labor  force.  This 
category  consists  mainly  of  students,  housewives,  retired 
workers,  seasonal  workers  enumerated  in  an  off  season 
who  were  not  looking  for  work,  institutionalized  persons, 
and  persons  doing  only  incidental  unpaid  family  work  (less 
than  15  hours  during  the  reference  week). 

Worker— This  term  appears  in  connection  with  several 
subjects:  journey-to-work  items,  class  of  worker,  weeks 
worked  in  1989,  and  number  of  workers  in  family  in  1989. 
Its  meaning  varies  and,  therefore,  should  be  determined  in 
each  case  by  referring  to  the  definition  of  the  subject  in 
which  it  appears. 

Actual  Hours  Worked  Last  Week— All  persons  who 
reported  working  during  the  reference  week  were  asked  to 
report  in  questionnaire  item  21b  the  number  of  hours  that 
they  worked.  The  statistics  on  hours  worked  pertain  to  the 
number  of  hours  actually  worked  at  all  jobs,  and  do  not 
necessarily  reflect  the  number  of  hours  typically  or  usually 
worked  or  the  scheduled  number  of  hours.  The  concept  of 
"actual  hours"  differs  from  that  of  "usual  hours"  described 
below.  The  number  of  persons  who  worked  only  a  small 
number  of  hours  is  probably  understated  since  such  per- 
sons sometimes  consider  themselves  as  not  working. 
Respondents  were  asked  to  include  overtime  or  extra 
hours  worked,  but  to  exclude  lunch  hours,  sick  leave,  and 
vacation  leave. 


B-6 


Limitation  of  the  Data— The  census  may  understate  the 
number  of  employed  persons  because  persons  who  have  • 
irregular,  casual,  or  unstructured  jobs  sometimes  report 
themselves  as  not  working.  The  number  of  employed 
persons  "at  work"  is  probably  overstated  in  the  census 
(and  conversely,  the  number  of  employed  "with  a  job,  but 
not  at  work"  is  understated)  since  some  persons  on 
vacation  or  sick  leave  erroneously  reported  themselves  as 
working.  This  problem  has  no  effect  on  the  total  number  of 
employed  persons.  The  reference  week  for  the  employ- 
ment data  is  not  the  same  for  all  persons.  Since  persons 
can  change  their  employment  status  from  one  week  to 
another,  the  lack  of  a  uniform  reference  week  may  mean 
that  the  employment  data  do  not  reflect  the  reality  of  the 
employment  situation  of  any  given  week.  (For  more  infor- 
mation, see  the  discussion  under  "Reference  Week.") 


Comparability— The  questionnaire  items  and  employment 
status  concepts  for  the  1990  census  are  essentially  the 
same  as  those  used  in  the  1980  and  1970  censuses. 
However,  these  concepts  differ  in  many  respects  from 
those  associated  with  the  1950  and  1960  censuses. 

Since  employment  data  from  the  census  are  obtained 
from  respondents  in  households,  they  differ  from  statistics 
based  on  reports  from  individual  business  establishments, 
farm  enterprises,  and  certain  government  programs.  Per- 
sons employed  at  more  than  one  job  are  counted  only 
once  in  the  census  and  are  classified  according  to  the  job 
at  which  they  worked  the  greatest  number  of  hours  during 
the  reference  week.  In  statistics  based  on  reports  from 
business  and  farm  establishments,  persons  who  work  for 
more  than  one  establishment  may  be  counted  more  than 
once.  Moreover,  some  tabulations  may  exclude  private 
household  workers,  unpaid  family  workers,  and  self-employed 
persons,  but  may  include  workers  less  than  16  years  of 
age. 

An  additional  difference  in  the  data  arises  from  the  fact 
that  persons  who  had  a  job  but  were  not  at  work  are 
included  with  the  employed  in  the  census  statistics,  whereas 
many  of  these  persons  are  likely  to  be  excluded  from 
employment  figures  based  on  establishment  payroll  reports. 
Furthermore,  the  employment  status  data  in  census  tabu- 
lations include  persons  on  the  basis  of  place  of  residence 
regardless  of  where  they  work,  whereas  establishment 
data  report  persons  at  their  place  of  work  regardless  of 
where  they  live.  This  latter  consideration  is  particularly 
significant  when  comparing  data  for  workers  who  commute 
between  areas. 

Census  data  on  actual  hours  worked  during  the  refer- 
ence week  may  differ  from  data  from  other  sources.  The 
census  measures  hours  actually  worked,  whereas  some 
surveys  measure  hours  paid  for  by  employers.  Compara- 
bility of  census  actual  hours  worked  data  may  also  be 
affected  by  the  nature  of  the  reference  week  (see  "Refer- 
ence Week"). 

For  several  reasons,  the  unemployment  figures  of  the 
Census  Bureau  are  not  comparable  with  published  figures 
on  unemployment  compensation  claims.   For  example, 

DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


figures  on  unemployment  compensation  claims  exclude 
persons  who  have  exhausted  their  benefit  rights,  new 
workers  who  have  not  earned  rights  to  unemployment 
insurance,  and  persons  losing  jobs  not  covered  by  unem- 
ployment insurance  systems  (including  some  workers  in 
agriculture,  domestic  services,  and  religious  organizations, 
and  self-employed  and  unpaid  family  workers).  In  addition, 
the  qualifications  for  drawing  unemployment  compensa- 
tion differ  from  the  definition  of  unemployment  used  by  the 
Census  Bureau.  Persons  working  only  a  few  hours  during 
the  week  and  persons  with  a  job  but  not  at  work  are 
sometimes  eligible  for  unemployment  compensation  but 
are  classified  as  "Employed"  in  the  census.  Differences  in 
the  geographical  distribution  of  unemployment  data  arise 
because  the  place  where  claims  are  filed  may  not  neces- 
sarily be  the  same  as  the  place  of  residence  of  the 
unemployed  worker. 

The  figures  on  employment  status  from  the  decennial 
census  are  generally  comparable  with  similar  data  col- 
lected in  the  Current  Population  Survey.  However,  some 
difference  may  exist  because  of  variations  in  enumeration 
and  processing  techniques. 

FERTILITY 

The  data  on  fertility  (also  referred  to  as  "children  ever 
born")  were  derived  from  answers  to  questionnaire  item 
20,  which  was  asked  of  a  sample  of  women  1 5  years  old 
and  over  regardless  of  marital  status.  Stillbirths,  stepchil- 
dren, and  adopted  children  were  excluded  from  the  num- 
ber of  children  ever  born.  Ever-married  women  were 
instructed  to  include  all  children  born  to  them  before  and 
during  their  most  recent  marriage,  children  no  longer  living, 
and  children  away  from  home,  as  well  as  children  who 
were  still  living  in  the  home.  Never-married  women  were 
instructed  to  include  all  children  born  to  them. 

Data  are  most  frequently  presented  in  terms  of  the 
aggregate  number  of  children  ever  born  to  women  in  the 
specified  category  and  in  terms  of  the  rate  per  1,000 
women.  For  purposes  of  calculating  the  aggregate,  the 
open-ended  response  category,  "12  or  more"  is  assigned 
a  value  of  13. 

Limitation  of  tlie  Data— Although  the  data  are  assumed 
to  be  less  complete  for  out-of-wedlock  births  than  for  births 
occurring  within  marriage,  comparisons  of  1980  census 
data  on  the  fertility  of  single  women  with  other  census 
sources  and  administrative  records  indicate  that  no  signif- 
icant differences  were  found  between  different  data  sources; 
that  is,  1 980  census  data  on  children  ever  born  to  single 
women  were  complete  with  no  significant  understatements 
of  childbearing. 

Comparability— The  wording  of  the  question  on  children 
ever  born  was  the  same  in  1990  as  in  1980.  In  1970, 
however,  the  question  on  children  ever  born  was  asked  of 
all  ever-married  women  but  only  of  never-married  women 


who  received  self-administered  questionnaires.  Therefore, 
rates  and  numbers  of  children  ever  born  to  single  women 
in  1970  may  be  understated.  Data  presented  for  children 
ever  born  to  ever-married  women  are  comparable  for  the 
1990  census  and  all  previous  censuses  containing  this 
question. 

GROUP  QUARTERS 

All  persons  not  living  in  households  are  classified  by  the 
Census  Bureau  as  living  in  group  quarters.  Two  general 
categories  of  persons  in  group  quarters  are  recognized: 
(1)  institutionalized  persons  and  (2)  other  persons  in  group 
quarters  (also  referred  to  as  "noninstitutional  group  quar- 
ters"). 

Institutionalized  Persons— Includes  persons  under  for- 
mally authorized,  supervised  care  or  custody  in  institutions 
at  the  time  of  enumeration.  Such  persons  are  classified  as 
"patients  or  inmates"  of  an  institution  regardless  of  the 
availability  of  nursing  or  medical  care,  the  length  of  stay,  or 
the  number  of  persons  in  the  institution.  Generally,  institu- 
tionalized persons  are  restricted  to  the  institutional  build- 
ings and  grounds  (or  must  have  passes  or  escorts  to 
leave)  and  thus  have  limited  interaction  with  the  surround- 
ing community.  Also,  they  are  generally  under  the  care  of 
trained  staff  who  have  responsibility  for  their  safekeeping 
and  supervision. 

Type  of  Institution— The  type  of  institution  was  deter- 
mined as  part  of  census  enumeration  activities.  For  insti- 
tutions which  specialize  in  only  one  specific  type  of  serv- 
ice, all  patients  or  inmates  were  given  the  same  classification. 
For  institutions  which  had  multiple  types  of  major  services 
(usually  general  hospitals  and  Veterans'  Administration 
hospitals),  patients  were  classified  according  to  selected 
types  of  wards.  For  example,  in  psychiatric  wards  of 
hospitals,  patients  were  classified  in  "mental  (psychiatric) 
hospitals";  in  hospital  wards  for  persons  with  chronic 
diseases,  patients  were  classified  in  "hospitals  for  the 
chronically  ill."  Each  patient  or  inmate  was  classified  in 
only  one  type  of  institution.  Institutions  include  the  follow- 
ing types: 

Correctional  Institutions— \nc\\i6es  prisons.  Federal  deten- 
tion centers,  military  stockades  and  jails,  police  lockups, 
halfway  houses,  local  jails,  and  other  confinement  facil- 
ities, including  work  farms. 

Prisons — Where  persons  convicted  of  crimes  serve 
their  sentences.  In  some  census  products,  the  pris- 
ons are  classified  by  two  types  of  control: 
(1)  "Federal"  (operated  by  the  Bureau  of  Prisons  of 
the  Department  of  Justice)  and  (2)  "State."  Resi- 
dents who  are  criminally  insane  were  classified  on 
the  basis  of  where  they  resided  at  the  time  of 
enumeration:  (1)  in  institutions  (or  hospital  wards)

operated  by  departments  of  correction  or  similar 
agencies;  or  (2)  in  institutions  operated  by  depart- 
ments of  mental  health  or  similar  agencies. 

Federal  Detention  Centers — Operated  by  the  Immi- 
gration and  Naturalization  Service  (INS)  and  the 
Bureau  of  Prisons.  These  facilities  include  detention 
centers  used  by  the  Park  Police;  Bureau  of  Indian 
Affairs  Detention  Centers;  INS  Centers,  such  as  the 
INS  Federal  Alien  Detention  Facility;  INS  Processing 
Centers;  and  INS  Contract  Detention  Centers  used  to 
detain  aliens  under  exclusion  or  deportation  proceed- 
ings, as  well  as  those  aliens  who  have  not  been 
placed  into  proceedings,  such  as  custodial  required 
departures;  and  INS  Detention  Centers  operated 
within  local  jails,  and  State  and  Federal  prisons. 

Military  Stockades,  Jails— Operated  by  military  police 
and  used  to  hold  persons  awaiting  trial  or  convicted 
of  violating  military  laws. 

Local  Jails  and  Other  Confinement  Facilities— In- 
cludes facilities  operated  by  counties  and  cities  that 
primarily  hold  persons  beyond  arraignment,  usually 
for  more  than  48  hours.  Also  included  in  this  category 
are  work  farms  used  to  hold  persons  awaiting  trial  or 
serving  time  on  relatively  short  sentences  and  jails 
run  by  private  businesses  under  contract  for  local 
governments  (but  not  by  State  governments). 

Police  Z-OC/fi/ps— Temporary-holding  facilities  oper- 
ated by  county  and  city  police  that  hold  persons  for 
48  hours  or  less  only  if  they  have  not  been  formally 
charged  in  court. 

Halfway  Houses— OpexaXed  for  correctional  purposes 
and  include  probation  and  restitution  centers,  pre- 
release centers,  and  community-residential  centers. 

Other  Types  of  Correctional  Institutions— Pnyate\y 
operated  correctional  facilities  and  correctional  facil- 
ities specifically  for  alcohol/drug  abuse. 

Nursing  Homes— Compnses  a  heterogeneous  group  of 
places.  The  majority  of  patients  are  elderly,  although 
persons  who  require  nursing  care  because  of  chronic 
physical  conditions  may  be  found  in  these  homes 
regardless  of  their  age.  Included  in  this  category  are 
skilled-nursing  facilities,  intermediate-care  facilities,  long- 
term  care  rooms  in  wards  or  buildings  on  the  grounds  of 
hospitals,  or  long-term  care  rooms/nursing  wings  in 
congregate  housing  facilities.  Also  included  are  nursing, 
convalescent,  and  rest  homes,  such  as  soldiers',  sail- 
ors', veterans',  and  fraternal  or  religious  homes  for  the 
aged,  with  or  without  nursing  care.  In  some  census 
products,  nursing  homes  are  classified  by  type  of  own- 
ership as  "Federal,"  "State,"  "Private  not-for-profit," 
and  "Private  for  profit." 


Mental  (Psychiatric)  Hospitals — Includes  hospitals  or 
wards  for  the  criminally  insane  not  operated  by  a  prison, 
and  psychiatric  wards  of  general  hospitals  and  veterans' 
hospitals.  Patients  receive  supervised  medical/nursing 
care  from  formally-trained  staff.  In  some  census  prod- 
ucts, mental  hospitals  are  classified  by  type  of  owner- 
ship as  "Federal,"  "State  or  local,"  "Private,"  and 
"Ownership  not  known." 

Hospitals  for  Chronically  III— \nc\udes  hospitals  for  patients 
who  require  long-term  care,  including  those  in  military 
hospitals  and  wards  for  the  chronically  ill  located  on 
military  bases;  or  other  hospitals  or  wards  for  the 
chronically  ill,  which  include  tuberculosis  hospitals  or 
wards,  wards  in  general  and  Veterans'  Administration 
hospitals  for  the  chronically  ill,  neurological  wards, 
hospices,  wards  for  patients  with  Hansen's  Disease 
(leprosy)  and  other  incurable  diseases,  and  other  unspec- 
ified wards  for  the  chronically  ill.  Patients  who  had  no 
usual  home  elsewhere  were  enumerated  as  part  of  the 
institutional  population  in  the  wards  of  general  and 
military  hospitals.  Most  hospital  patients  are  at  the 
hospital  temporarily  and  were  enumerated  at  their  usual 
place  of  residence.  (For  more  information,  see  "Wards 
in  General  and  Military  Hospitals  for  Patients  Who  Have 
No  Usual  Home  Elsewhere.") 

Schools,  Hospitals,  or  Wards  for  the  Mentally  Retard- 
ed— Includes  those  institutions  such  as  wards  in  hospi- 
tals for  the  mentally  retarded,  and  intermediate-care 
facilities  for  the  mentally  retarded  that  provide  super- 
vised medical/nursing  care  from  formally-trained  staff. 
In  some  census  products,  this  category  is  classified  by 
type  of  ownership  as  "Federal,"  "State  or  local,"  "Pri- 
vate," and  "Ownership  not  known." 

Schools,  Hospitals,  or  Wards  for  the  Physically  Handi- 
capped— Includes  three  types  of  institutions:  institutions 
for  the  blind,  those  for  the  deaf,  and  orthopedic  wards 
and  institutions  for  the  physically  handicapped.  Institu- 
tions for  persons  with  speech  problems  are  classified 
with  "institutions  for  the  deaf."  The  category  "orthope- 
dic wards  and  institutions  for  the  physically  handi- 
capped" includes  those  institutions  providing  relatively 
long-term  care  to  accident  victims,  and  to  persons  with 
polio,  cerebral  palsy,  and  muscular  dystrophy.  In  some 
census  products,  this  category  is  classified  by  type  of 
ownership  as  "Public,"  "Private,"  and  'Ownership  not 
known." 

Hospitals,  and  Wards  for  Drug/Alcohol  Abuse — Includes 
hospitals,  and  hospital  wards  in  psychiatric  and  general 
hospitals.  These  facilities  are  equipped  medically  and 
designed  for  the  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  medical  or 
psychiatric  illnesses  associated  with  alcohol  or  drug 
abuse.  Patients  receive  supervised  medical  care  from 
formally-trained  staff.  |

Wards  in  Genera/  and  Military  l-iospitais  for  Patients 
Whio  l-lave  No  Usual l-iome  Elsewhere— \wc\\x^qs  mater- 
nity, neonatal,  pediatric  (Including  wards  for  boarder 
babies),  military,  and  surgical  wards  of  hospitals,  and 
wards  for  persons  with  infectious  diseases. 

Juvenile  Institutions— \'c\c\u6es  homes,  schools,  and  other 
institutions  providing  care  for  children  (short-  or  long- 
term  care).  Juvenile  institutions  include  the  following 
types: 

Homes  for  Abused,  Dependent,  and  Neglected  Chil- 
dren—\uc\u6es  orphanages  and  other  institutions 
which  provide  long-term  care  (usually  more  than  30 
days)  for  children.  This  category  is  classified  in  some 
census  products  by  type  of  ownership  as  "Public" 
and  "Private." 

Residential  Treatment  Centers— \nc\udes  those  insti- 
tutions which  primarily  serve  children  who,  by  clinical 
diagnosis,  are  moderately  or  seriously  disturbed  emo- 
tionally. Also,  these  institutions  provide  long-term 
treatment  services,  usually  supervised  or  directed  by 
a  psychiatrist. 

Training  Schools  for  Juvenile  Delinquents— \nc\u6es 
residential  training  schools  or  homes,  and  industrial 
schools,  camps,  or  farms  for  juvenile  delinquents. 

Public  Training  Schools  for  Juvenile  Delinquents— 
Usually  operated  by  a  State  agency  (for  example, 
department  of  welfare,  corrections,  or  a  youth 
authority).  Some  are  operated  by  county  and  city 
governments.  These  public  training  schools  are 
specialized  institutions  serving  delinquent  children, 
generally  between  the  ages  of  10  and  17  years 
old,  all  of  whom  are  committed  by  the  courts. 

Private  Training  Schools— Operated  under  private 
auspices.  Some  of  the  children  they  sen/e  are 
committed  by  the  courts  as  delinquents.  Others 
are  referred  by  parents  or  social  agencies  because 
of  delinquent  behavior.  One  difference  between 
private  and  public  training  schools  is  that,  by  their 
administrative  policy,  private  schools  have  control 
over  their  selection  and  intake. 

Detention  Ce/7ters— Includes  institutions  providing  short- 
term  care  (usually  30  days  or  less)  primarily  for 
delinquent  children  pending  disposition  of  their  cases 
by  a  court.  This  category  also  covers  diagnostic 
centers.  In  practice,  such  institutions  may  be  caring 
for  both  delinquent  and  neglected  children  pending 
court  disposition. 

Other  Persons  in  Group  Quarters  (also  referred  to  as 
"nonlnstitutional  group  quarters")— Includes  all.  per- 
sons who  live  in  group  quarters  other  than  institutions. 
Persons  who   live   in  the  following   living   quarters  are 


classified  as  "other  persons  in  group  quarters"  when  there 
are  10  or  more  unrelated  persons  living  in  the  unit; 
otherwise,  these  living  quarters  are  classified  as  housing 
units. 

Rooming  Houses — Includes  persons  residing  in  room- 
ing and  boarding  houses  and  living  in  quarters  with  1 0  or 
more  unrelated  persons. 

Group  Homes — Includes  "community-based  homes" 
that  provide  care  and  supportive  services.  Such  places 
include  homes  for  the  mentally  ill,  mentally  retarded, 
and  physically  handicapped;  drug/alcohol  halfway  houses; 
communes;  and  maternity  homes  for  unwed  mothers. 

Homes  for  the  Mentally  ///—Includes  community- 
based  homes  that  provide  care  primarily  for  the 
mentally  ill.  In  some  data  products,  this  category  is 
classified  by  type  of  ownership  as  "Federal,"  "State," 
"Private,"  and  "Ownership  not  known."  Homes  which 
combine  treatment  of  the  physically  handicapped 
with  treatment  of  the  mentally  ill  are  counted  as 
homes  for  the  mentally  ill. 

Homes  for  the  Mentally  Retarded— Indudes  community- 
based  homes  that  provide  care  primarily  for  the 
mentally  retarded.  Homes  which  combine  treatment 
of  the  physically  handicapped  with  treatment  of  the 
mentally  retarded  are  counted  as  homes  for  the 
mentally  retarded.  This  category  is  classified  by  type 
of  ownership  in  some  census  products,  as  "Federal," 
"State,"  "Private,"  or  "Ownership  not  known." 

Homes  for  the  Physically  Handicapped— \nc\udes 
community-based  homes  for  the  blind,  for  the  deaf, 
and  other  community-based  homes  for  the  physically 
handicapped.  Persons  with  speech  problems  are 
classified  with  homes  for  the  deaf.  In  some  census 
products,  this  category  is  classified  by  type  of  own- 
ership as  "Public,"  "Private,"  or  "Ownership  not 
known." 

Homes  or  Halfway  Houses  for  Drug/Alcohol  Abuse— \n- 
cludes  persons  with  no  usual  home  elsewhere  in 
places  that  provide  community-based  care  and  sup- 
portive services  to  persons  suffering  from  a  drug/al- 
cohol addiction  and  to  recovering  alcoholics  and  drug 
abusers.  Places  providing  community-based  care  for 
drug  and  alcohol  abusers  include  group  homes, 
detoxification  centers,  quarterway  houses  (residen- 
tial treatment  facilities  that  work  closely  with  accred- 
ited hospitals),  halfway  houses,  and  recovery  homes 
for  ambulatory,  mentally  competent  recovering  alco- 
holics and  drug  abusers  who  may  be  re-entering  the 
work  force. 

Maternity  Homes  for  Unwed  Mothers— \nc\udes  per- 
sons with  no  usual  home  elsewhere  in  places  that 
provide  domestic  care  for  unwed  mothers  and  their

children.  These  homes  may  provide  social  services 
and  post-natal  care  within  the  facility,  or  may  make 
arrangements  for  women  to  receive  such  services  in 
the  community.  Nursing  services  are  usually  available 
in  the  facility. 

Other  Group  /Vomes— Includes  persons  with  no  usual 
home  elsewhere  in  communes,  foster  care  homes, 
and  job  corps  centers  with  10  or  more  unrelated 
persons.  These  types  of  places  provide  communal 
living  quarters,  generally  for  persons  who  have  formed 
their  own  community  in  which  they  have  common 
interests  and  often  share  or  own  property  jointly. 

Religious  Group  Quarters — Includes,  primarily,  group 
quarters  for  nuns  teaching  in  parochial  schools  and  for 
priests  living  in  rectories.  It  also  includes  other  convents 
and  monasteries,  except  those  associated  with  a  gen- 
eral hospital  or  an  institution. 

College  Quarters  Off  Campus— \r\c\udes  privately-owned 
rooming  and  boarding  houses  off  campus,  if  the  place  is 
reserved  exclusively  for  occupancy  by  college  students 
and  if  there  are  10  or  more  unrelated  persons.  In  census 
products,  persons  in  this  category  are  classified  as  living 
in  a  college  dormitory. 

Persons  residing  in  certain  other  types  of  living  arrange- 
ments are  classified  as  living  in  "noninstitutional  group 
quarters"  regardless  of  the  number  of  people  sharing  the 
unit.  These  include  persons  residing  in  the  following  types 
of  group  quarters: 

College  Dormitories— \r\c\u6es  college  students  in  dor- 
mitories (provided  the  dormitory  is  restricted  to  students 
who  do  not  have  their  families  living  with  them),  frater- 
nity and  sorority  houses,  and  on-campus  residential 
quarters  used  exclusively  for  those  in  religious  orders 
who  are  attending  college.  Students  in  privately-owned 
rooming  and  boarding  houses  off  campus  are  also 
included,  if  the  place  is  reserved  exclusively  for  occu- 
pancy by  college-level  students  and  if  there  are  10  or 
more  unrelated  persons. 

Military  Quarters— \nc\u6es  military  personnel  living  in 
barracks  and  dormitories  on  base,  in  transient  quarters 
on  base  for  temporary  residents  (both  civilian  and 
military),  and  on  military  ships.  However,  patients  in 
military  hospitals  receiving  treatment  for  chronic  dis- 
eases or  who  had  no  usual  home  elsewhere,  and 
persons  being  held  in  military  stockades  were  included 
as  part  of  the  institutional  population. 

Agriculture  Workers'  Dormitories— \nc\udes  persons  in 
migratory  farm  workers'  camps  on  farms,  bunkhouses 
for  ranch  hands,  and  other  dormitories  on  farms,  such 
as  those  on  "tree  farms." 


Other  Workers'  Dormitories— \nc\udes  persons  in  log- 
ging camps,  construction  workers'  camps,  firehouse 
dormitories,  job-training  camps,  energy  enclaves  (Alaska 
only),  and  nonfarm  migratory  workers'  camps  (for  exam- 
ple, workers  in  mineral  and  mining  camps). 

Emergency  Shelters  for  Homeless  Persons  (with  sleep- 
ing facilities)  and  Visible  in  Street  Locations — Includes 
persons  enumerated  during  the  "Shelter-and-Street- 
Night"  operation  primarily  on  March  20-21,  1990.  Enu- 
merators were  instructed  not  to  ask  if  a  person  was 
"homeless."  If  a  person  was  at  one  of  the  locations 
below  on  March  20-21,  the  person  was  counted  as 
described  below.  (For  more  information  on  the  "Shelter- 
and-Street-Night"  operation,  see  Appendix  D,  Collec- 
tion and  Processing  Procedures.)  This  category  is  divided 
into  four  classifications: 

Emergency  Shelters  for  Homeless  Persons  (with 
sleeping  facilities) — Includes  persons  who  stayed 
overnight  on  March  20,  1990,  in  permanent  and 
temporary  emergency  housing,  missions,  hotels/mo- 
tels, and  flophouses  charging  SI  2  or  less  (excluding 
taxes)  per  night;  Salvation  Army  shelters,  hotels,  and 
motels  used  entirely  for  homeless  persons  regard- 
less of  the  nightly  rate  charged;  rooms  in  hotels  and 
motels  used  partially  for  the  homeless;  and  similar 
places  known  to  have  persons  who  have  no  usual 
home  elsewhere  staying  overnight.  If  not  shown 
separately,  shelters  and  group  homes  that  provide 
temporary  sleeping  facilities  for  runaway,  neglected, 
and  homeless  children  are  included  in  this  category 
in  data  products. 

Shelters  for  Runaway  Neglected,  and  Homeless 
Children — Includes  shelters/group  homes  which  pro- 
vide temporary  sleeping  facilities  for  juveniles. 

Visible  in  Street  Locations — Includes  street  blocks 
and  open  public  locations  designated  before 
March  20,  1990,  by  city  and  community  officials  as 
places  where  the  homeless  congregate  at  night.  All 
persons  found  at  predesignated  street  sites  from  2 
a.m.  to  4  a.m.  and  leaving  abandoned  or  boarded-up 
buildings  from  4  a.m.  to  8  a.m.  on  March  21,  1990, 
were  enumerated  during  "street"  enumeration,  except 
persons  in  uniform  such  as  police  and  persons 
engaged  in  obvious  money-making  activities  other 
than  begging  or  panhandling.  Enumerators  were 
instructed  not  to  ask  if  a  person  was  "homeless." 
This  cannot  be  considered  a  complete  count  of  all 
persons  living  on  the  streets  because  those  who 
were  so  well  hidden  that  local  people  did  not  know 
where  to  find  them  were  likely  to  have  been  missed 
as  were  persons  moving  about  or  in  places  not 
identified  by  local  officials.  It  is  also  possible  that 
persons  with  homes  could  have  been  included  in  the 
count  of  "visible  in  street  locations"  if  they  were 
present  when  the  enumerator  did  the  enumeration  of 
a  particular  block.

Predesignated  street  sites  include  street  corners, 
parks,  bridges,  persons  emerging  from  abandoned 
and  boarded-up  buildings,  noncommercial  campsites 
(tent  cities),  all-night  movie  theaters,  all-night  restau- 
rants, emergency  hospital  waiting  rooms,  train  sta- 
tions, airports,  bus  depots,  and  subway  stations. 

Shelters  for  Abused  Women  (Shelters  Against  Domes- 
tic Violence  or  Family  Crisis  CeA7ters^— Includes 
community-based  homes  or  shelters  that  provide 
domiciliary  care  for  women  who  have  sought  shelter 
from  family  violence  and  who  may  have  been  physi- 
cally abused.  Most  shelters  also  provide  care  for 
children  of  abused  women.  These  shelters  may  pro- 
vide social  services,  meals,  psychiatric  treatment, 
and  counseling.  In  some  census  products,  "shelters 
for  abused  women"  are  included  in  the  category 
"other  noninstitutional  group  quarters." 

Dormitories  for  Nurses  and  Interns  in  General  and 
Military  Hospitals— Includes  group  quarters  for  nurses 
and  other  staff  members.  It  excludes  patients. 

Crews  of  Maritime  Vessels — Includes  officers,  crew 
members,  and  passengers  of  maritime  U.S.  flag  ves- 
sels. All  ocean-going  and  Great  Lakes  ships  are  included. 

Staff  Residents  of  Institutions— \nc\udes  staff  residing  in 
group  quarters  on  institutional  grounds  who  provide 
formally-authorized,  supervised  care  or  custody  for  the 
institutionalized  population. 

Other  Nonhousehold  Living  Situations — Includes  per- 
sons with  no  usual  home  elsewhere  enumerated  during 
transient  or  "T-Night"  enumeration  at  YMCA's,  YWCA's, 
youth  hostels,  commercial  and  government-run  camp- 
grounds, campgrounds  at  racetracks,  fairs,  and  carni- 
vals, and  similar  transient  sites. 

Living  Quarters  for  Victims  of  Natural  Disasters— In- 
cludes living  quarters  for  persons  temporarily  displaced 
by  natural  disasters. 

Limitation  of  the  Data — Two  types  of  errors  can  occur  in 
the  classification  of  "types  of  group  quarters": 

1.  Misclassification  of  Group  Quarters— During  the  1990 
Special  Place  Prelist  operation,  the  enumerator  deter- 
mined the  type  of  group  quarters  associated  with  each 
special  place  in  their  assignment.  The  enumerator 
used  the  Alphabetical  Group  Quarters  Code  List  and 
Index  to  the  Alphabetical  Group  Quarters  Code  List  to 
assign  a  two-digit  code  number  followed  by  either  an 
"I,"  for  institutional,  or  an  "N,"  for  noninstitutional  to 
each  group  quarters.  In  1990,  unacceptable  group 
quarter  codes  were  edited.  (For  more  information  on 
editing  of  unacceptable  data,  see  Appendix  C,  Accu- 
racy of  the  Data.) 


2.  No  Classification  (unknowns)— The  imputation  rate  for 
type  of  institution  was  higher  in  1980  (23.5  percent) 
than  In  1970  (3.3  percent).  Improvements  were  made 
to  the  1990  Alphabetical  Group  Quarters  Code  List; 
that  is,  the  inclusion  of  more  group  quarters  categories 
and  an  "Index  to  the  Alphabetical  Group  Quarters 
Code  List."  (For  more  information  on  the  allocation 
rates  for  Type  of  Institution,  see  the  allocation  rates  in 
1990  CP-1,  General  Population  Characteristics.) 

In  previous  censuses,  allocation  rates  for  demographic 
characteristics  (such  as  age,  sex,  race,  and  marital  status) 
of  the  institutional  population  were  similar  to  those  for  the 
total  population.  The  allocation  rates  for  sample  charac- 
teristics such  as  school  enrollment,  highest  grade  com- 
pleted, income,  and  veteran  status  for  the  institutional  and 
noninstitutional  group  quarters  population  have  been  sub- 
stantially higher  than  the  population  in  households  at  least 
as  far  back  as  the  1 960  census.  The  data,  however,  have 
historically  presented  a  reasonable  picture  of  the  institu- 
tional and  noninstitutional  group  quarters  population. 

Shelter  and  Street  Night  (S-Night)— For  the  1990  census 
"Shelter-and-Street-Night"  operation,  persons  well  hid- 
den, moving  about,  or  in  locations  enumerators  did  not  visit 
were  likely  to  be  missed.  The  number  of  people  missed  will 
never  be  known;  thus,  the  1990  census  cannot  be  consid- 
ered to  include  a  definitive  count  of  America's  total  home- 
less population.  It  does,  however,  give  an  idea  of  relative 
differences  among  areas  of  the  country.  Other  compo- 
nents were  counted  as  part  of  regular  census  procedures. 
The  count  of  persons  in  shelters  and  visible  on  the 
street  could  have  been  affected  by  many  factors.  How 
much  the  factors  affected  the  count  can  never  be  answered 
definitively,  but  some  elements  include: 

1 .  How  well  enumerators  were  trained  and  how  well  they 
followed  procedures. 

2.  How  well  the  list  of  shelter  and  street  locations  given 
to  the  Census  Bureau  by  the  local  government  reflected 
the  actual  places  that  homeless  persons  stay  at  night. 

3.  Cities  were  encouraged  to  open  temporary  shelters  for 
census  night,  and  many  did  that  and  actively  encour- 
aged people  to  enter  the  shelters.  Thus,  people  who 
may  have  been  on  the  street  otherwise  were  in 
shelters  the  night  of  March  20,  so  that  the  ratio  of 
shelter-to-street  population  could  be  different  than 
usual. 

4.  The  weather,  which  was  unusually  cold  in  some  parts 
of  the  country,  could  affect  how  likely  people  were  to 
seek  emergency  shelter  or  to  be  more  hidden  than 
usual  if  they  stayed  outdoors. 

5.  The  media  occasionally  interfered  with  the  ability  to  do 
the  count. 

6.  How  homeless  people  perceived  the  census  and 
whether  they  wanted  to  be  counted  or  feared  the 
census  and  hid  from  it.

B-11 


The  Census  Bureau  conducted  two  assessments  of 
Shelter  and  Street  Night:  (1)  the  quality  of  the  lists  of 
shelters  used  for  the  Shelter-and-Street-Night  operation, 
and  (2)  how  well  procedures  were  followed  by  census- 
takers  for  the  street  count  in  parts  of  five  cities  (Chicago, 
Los  Angeles,  New  Orleans,  New  York,  and  Phoenix). 
Information  about  these  two  assessments  is  available  from 
the  Chief,  Center  for  Survey  Methods  Research,  Bureau  of 
the  Census,  Washington,  DC  20233. 

Comparability— For  the  1990  census,  the  definition  of 
institutionalized  persons  was  revised  so  that  the  definition 
of  "care"  only  includes  persons  under  organized  medical 
or  formally-authorized,  supervised  care  or  custody.  As  a 
result  of  this  change  to  the  institutional  definition,  maternity 
homes  are  classified  as  noninstitutional  rather  than  insti- 
tutional group  quarters  as  in  previous  censuses.  The 
following  types  of  other  group  quarters  are  classified  as 
institutional  rather  than  noninstitutional  group  quarters: 
"halfway  houses  (operated  for  correctional  purposes)" 
and  "wards  in  general  and  military  hospitals  for  patients 
who  have  no  usual  home  elsewhere,"  which  includes 
maternity,  neonatal,  pediatric,  military,  and  surgical  wards 
of  hospitals,  other-purpose  wards  of  hospitals,  and  wards 
for  infectious  diseases.  These  changes  should  not  signifi- 
cantly affect  the  comparability  of  data  with  earlier  cen- 
suses because  of  the  relatively  small  number  of  persons 
involved. 

As  in  1980, 10  or  more  unrelated  persons  living  together 
were  classified  as  living  in  noninstitutional  group  quarters. 
In  1970,  the  criteria  was  six  or  more  unrelated  persons. 

Several  changes  also  have  occurred  in  the  identification 
of  specific  types  of  group  quarters.  For  the  first  time,  the 
1990  census  identifies  separately  the  following  types  of 
correctional  institutions:  persons  in  halfway  houses  (oper- 
ated for  correctional  purposes),  military  stockades  and 
jails,  and  police  lockups.  In  1990,  tuberculosis  hospitals  or 
wards  are  included  with  hospitals  for  the  chronically  ill;  in 
1 980,  they  were  shown  separately.  For  1 990,  the  noninsti- 
tutional group  quarters  category,  "Group  homes"  is  further 
classified  as:  group  homes  for  drug/alcohol  abuse;  mater- 
nity homes  (for  unwed  mothers),  group  homes  for  the 
mentally  ill,  group  homes  for  the  mentally  retarded,  and 
group  homes  for  the  physically  handicapped.  Persons 
living  in  communes,  foster-care  homes,  and  job  corps 
centers  are  classified  with  "Other  group  homes"  only  if  10 
or  more  unrelated  persons  share  the  unit;  otherwise,  they 
are  classified  as  housing  units. 

In  1990,  workers'  dormitories  were  classified  as  group 
quarters  regardless  of  the  number  of  persons  sharing  the 
dorm.  In  1980,  10  or  more  unrelated  persons  had  to  share 
the  dorm  for  it  to  be  classified  as  a  group  quarters.  In  1 960, 
data  on  persons  in  military  barracks  were  shown  only  for 
men.  In  subsequent  censuses,  they  include  both  men  and 
women. 

In  1990  census  data  products,  the  phrase  "inmates  of 
institutions"  was  changed  to  "institutionalized  persons." 
Also,  persons  living  in  noninstitutional  group  quarters  were 


referred  to  as  "other  persons  in  group  quarters,"  and  the 
phrase  "staff  residents"  was  used  for  staff  living  in  institu- 
tions. 

In  1990,  there  are  additional  institutional  categories  and 
noninstitutional  group  quarters  categories  compared  with 
the  1980  census.  The  institutional  categories  added  include 
"hospitals  and  wards  for  drug/alcohol  abuse"  and  "mili- 
tary hospitals  for  the  chronically  ill."  The  noninstitutional 
group  quarters  categories  added  include  emergency  shel- 
ters for  homeless  persons;  shelters  for  runaway,  neglected, 
and  homeless  children;  shelters  for  abused  women;  and 
visible-in-street  locations.  Each  of  these  noninstitutional 
group  quarters  categories  was  enumerated  on  March 
20-21,  1990,  during  the  "Shelter-and-Street-Night"  opera- 
tion. (For  more  information  on  the  "Shelter-and-Street- 
Night"  operation,  see  Appendix  D,  Collection  and  Process- 
ing Procedures.) 

HISPANIC  ORIGIN 

The  data  on  Spanish/Hispanic  origin  were  derived  from 
answers  to  questionnaire  item  7,  which  was  asked  of  all 
persons.  Persons  of  Hispanic  origin  are  those  who  classi- 
fied themselves  in  one  of  the  specific  Hispanic  origin 
categories  listed  on  the  questionnaire — "Mexican,"  "Puerto 
Rican,"  or  "Cuban" — as  well  as  those  who  indicated  that 
they  were  of  "other  Spanish/Hispanic"  origin.  Persons  of 
"Other  Spanish/Hispanic"  origin  are  those  whose  origins 
are  from  Spain,  the  Spanish-speaking  countries  of  Central 
or  South  America,  or  the  Dominican  Republic,  or  they  are 
persons  of  Hispanic  origin  identifying  themselves  generally 
as  Spanish,  Spanish-American,  Hispanic,  Hispano,  Latino, 
and  so  on.  Write-in  responses  to  the  "other  Spanish/His- 
panic" category  were  coded  only  for  sample  data. 

Origin  can  be  viewed  as  the  ancestry,  nationality  group, 
lineage,  or  country  of  birth  of  the  person  or  the  person's 
parents  or  ancestors  before  their  arrival  in  the  United 
States.  Persons  of  Hispanic  origin  may  be  of  any  race. 

Some  tabulations  are  shown  by  the  Hispanic  origin  of 
the  householder.  In  all  cases  where  households,  families, 
or  occupied  housing  units  are  classified  by  Hispanic  origin, 
the  Hispanic  origin  of  the  householder  is  used.  (See  the 
discussion  of  householder  under  "Household  Type  and 
Relationship.") 

During  direct  interviews  conducted  by  enumerators,  if  a 
person  could  not  provide  a  single  origin  response,  he  or 
she  was  asked  to  select,  based  on  self-identification,  the 
group  which  best  described  his  or  her  origin  or  descent.  If 
a  person  could  not  provide  a  single  group,  the  origin  of  the 
person's  mother  was  used.  If  a  single  group  could  not  be 
provided  for  the  person's  mother,  the  first  origin  reported 
by  the  person  was  used. 

If  any  household  member  failed  to  respond  to  the 
Spanish/Hispanic  origin  question,  a  response  was  assigned 
by  the  computer  according  to  the  reported  entries  of  other 
household  members  by  using  specific  rules  of  precedence 
of  household  relationship.  In  the  processing  of  sample 


B-12 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


questionnaires,  responses  to  other  questions  on  the  ques- 
tionnaire, such  as  ancestry  and  place  of  birth,  were  used  to 
assign  an  origin  before  any  reference  was  made  to  the 
origin  reported  by  other  household  members.  If  an  origin 
was  not  entered  for  any  household  member,  an  origin  was 
assigned  from  another  household  according  to  the  race  of 
the  householder.  This  procedure  is  a  variation  of  the 
general  imputation  process  described  in  Appendix  C,  Accu- 
racy of  the  Data. 

Comparability— There  may  be  differences  between  the 
total  Hispanic  origin  population  based  on  100-percent 
tabulations  and  sample  tabulations.  Such  differences  are 
the  result  of  sampling  variability,  nonsampling  error,  and 
more  extensive  edit  procedures  for  the  Spanish/Hispanic 
origin  item  on  the  sample  questionnaires.  (For  more  infor- 
mation on  sampling  variability  and  nonsampling  error,  see 
Appendix  C,  Accuracy  of  the  Data.) 

The  1990  data  on  Hispanic  origin  are  generally  compa- 
rable with  those  for  the  1 980  census.  However,  there  are 
some  differences  in  the  format  of  the  Hispanic  origin 
question  between  the  two  censuses.  For  1990,  the  word 
"descent"  was  deleted  from  the  1980  wording.  In  addition, 
the  term  "Mexican-Amer."  used  in  1980  was  shortened 
further  to  "Mexican-Am."  to  reduce  misreporting  (of  "Amer- 
ican") in  this  category  detected  in  the  1980  census.  Finally, 
the  1990  question  allowed  those  who  reported  as  "other 
Spanish/Hispanic"  to  write  in  their  specific  Hispanic  origin 
group. 

Misreporting  in  the  "Mexican-Amer."  category  of  the 
1980  census  item  on  Spanish/Hispanic  origin  may  affect 
the  comparability  of  1980  and  1990  census  data  for 
persons  of  Hispanic  origin  for  certain  areas  of  the  country. 
An  evaluation  of  the  1980  census  item  on  Spanish/His- 
panic origin  indicated  that  there  was  misreporting  in  the 
Mexican  origin  category  by  White  and  Black  persons  in 
certain  areas.  The  study  results  showed  evidence  that  the 
misreporting  occurred  in  the  South  (excluding  Texas),  the 
Northeast  (excluding  the  New  York  City  area),  and  a  few 
States  in  the  Midwest  Region.  Also,  results  based  on 
available  data  suggest  that  the  impact  of  possible  misre- 
porting of  Mexican  origin  in  the  1 980  census  was  severe  in 
those  portions  of  the  above-mentioned  regions  where  the 
Hispanic  origin  population  was  generally  sparse.  However, 
national  1 980  census  data  on  the  Mexican  origin  popula- 
tion or  total  Hispanic  origin  population  at  the  national  level 
was  not  seriously  affected  by  the  reporting  problem.  (For  a 
more  detailed  discussion  of  the  evaluation  of  the  1980 
census  Spanish/Hispanic  origin  item,  see  the  1 980  census 
Supplementary  Reports.) 

The  1990  and  1980  census  data  on  the  Hispanic 
population  are  not  directly  comparable  with  1 970  Spanish 
origin  data  because  of  a  number  of  factors:  (1)  overall 
improvements  in  the  1 980  and  1 990  censuses,  (2)  better 
coverage  of  the  population,  (3)  improved  question  designs, 
and  (4)  an  effective  public  relations  campaign  by  the 
Census  Bureau  with  the  assistance  of  national  and  com- 
munity ethnic  groups. 


Specific  changes  in  question  design  between  the  1 980 
and  1970  censuses  included  the  placement  of  the  cate- 
gory "No,  not  Spanish/Hispanic"  as  the  first  category  in 
that  question.  (The  corresponding  category  appeared  last 
in  the  1970  question.)  Also,  the  1970  category  "Central  or 
South  American"  was  deleted  because  in  1970  some 
respondents  misinterpreted  the  category;  furthermore,  the 
designations  "Mexican-American"  and  "Chicano"  were 
added  to  the  Spanish/Hispanic  origin  question  in  1980.  In 
the  1970  census,  the  question  on  Spanish  origin  was 
asked  of  only  a  5-percent  sample  of  the  population. 

HOUSEHOLD  TYPE  AND  RELATIONSHIP 
Household 

A  household  includes  all  the  persons  who  occupy  a 
housing  unit.  A  housing  unit  is  a  house,  an  apartment,  a 
mobile  home,  a  group  of  rooms,  or  a  single  room  that  is 
occupied  (or  if  vacant,  is  intended  for  occupancy)  as 
separate  living  quarters.  Separate  living  quarters  are  those 
in  which  the  occupants  live  and  eat  separately  from  any 
other  persons  in  the  building  and  which  have  direct  access 
from  the  outside  of  the  building  or  through  a  common  hall. 
The  occupants  may  be  a  single  family,  one  person  living 
alone,  two  or  more  families  living  together,  or  any  other 
group  of  related  or  unrelated  persons  who  share  living 
arrangements. 

In  100-percent  tabulations,  the  count  of  households  or 
householders  always  equals  the  count  of  occupied  hous- 
ing units.  In  sample  tabulations,  the  numbers  may  differ  as 
a  result  of  the  weighting  process. 

Persons  Per  Household— A  measure  obtained  by  divid- 
ing the  number  of  persons  in  households  by  the  number  of 
households  (or  householders).  In  cases  where  persons  in 
households  are  cross-classified  by  race  or  Hispanic  origin, 
persons  in  the  household  are  classified  by  the  race  or 
Hispanic  origin  of  the  householder  rather  than  the  race  or 
Hispanic  origin  of  each  individual. 

Relationship  to  Householder 

Householder— The  data  on  relationship  to  householder 
were  derived  from  answers  to  questionnaire  item  2,  which 
was  asked  of  all  persons  in  housing  units.  One  person  in 
each  household  is  designated  as  the  householder.  In  most 
cases,  this  is  the  person,  or  one  of  the  persons,  in  whose 
name  the  home  is  owned,  being  bought,  or  rented  and  who 
is  listed  in  column  1  of  the  census  questionnaire.  If  there  is 
no  such  person  in  the  household,  any  adult  household 
member  1 5  years  old  and  over  could  be  designated  as  the 
householder. 

Households  are  classified  by  type  according  to  the  sex 
of  the  householder  and  the  presence  of  relatives.  Two 
types  of  householders  are  distinguished:  a  family  house- 
holder and  a  nonfamily  householder.  A  family  householder 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


B-13 


is  a  householder  living  with  one  or  more  persons  related  to 
him  or  her  by  birth,  marriage,  or  adoption.  The  householder 
and  all  persons  in  the  household  related  to  him  or  her  are 
family  members.  A  nonfamily  householder  is  a  house- 
holder living  alone  or  with  nonrelatives  only. 

Spouse — Includes  a  person  married  to  and  living  with  a 
householder.  This  category  includes  persons  in  formal 
marriages,  as  well  as  persons  in  common-law  marriages. 
The  number  of  spouses  is  equal  to  the  number  of 
"married-couple  families"  or  "married-couple  households" 
in  100-percent  tabulations.  The  number  of  spouses,  how- 
ever, is  generally  less  than  half  of  the  number  of  "married 
persons  with  spouse  present"  in  sample  tabulations,  since 
more  than  one  married  couple  can  live  in  a  household,  but 
only  spouses  of  householders  are  specifically  identified  as 
"spouse."  For  sample  tabulations,  the  number  of  "married 
persons  with  spouse  present"  includes  married-couple 
subfamilies  and  married-couple  families. 

Child— Includes  a  son  or  daughter  by  birth,  a  stepchild,  or 
adopted  child  of  the  householder,  regardless  of  the  child's 
age  or  marital  status.  The  category  excludes  sons-in-law, 
daughters-in-law,  and  foster  children. 

Natural-Born  or  Adopted  Son /Daughter— IK  son  or  daugh- 
ter of  the  householder  by  birth,  regardless  of  the  age  of 
the  child.  Also,  this  category  includes  sons  or  daughters 
of  the  householder  by  legal  adoption,  regardless  of  the 
age  of  the  child.  If  the  stepson/stepdaughter  of  the 
householder  has  been  legally  adopted  by  the  house- 
holder, the  child  is  still  classified  as  a  stepchild. 

Stepson/Stepdaughter— k  son  or  daughter  of  the  house- 
holder through  marriage  but  not  by  birth,  regardless  of 
the  age  of  the  child.  If  the  stepson/stepdaughter  of  the 
householder  has  been  legally  adopted  by  the  house- 
holder, the  child  is  still  classified  as  a  stepchild. 

Own  Child— fK  never-married  child  under  18  years  who 
is  a  son  or  daughter  by  birth,  a  stepchild,  or  an  adopted 
child  of  the  householder.  In  certain  tabulations,  own 
children  are  further  classified  as  living  with  two  parents 
or  with  one  parent  only.  Own  children  of  the  house- 
holder living  with  two  parents  are  by  definition  found 
only  in  married-couple  families. 

In  a  subfamily,  an  "own  child"  is  a  never-married 
child  under  18  years  of  age  who  is  a  son,  daughter, 
stepchild,  or  an  adopted  child  of  a  mother  in  a  mother- 
child  subfamily,  a  father  in  a  father-child  subfamily,  or 
either  spouse  in  a  married-couple  subfamily. 

"Related  children"  in  a  family  include  own  children  and 
all  other  persons  under  18  years  of  age  in  the  household, 
regardless  of  marital  status,  who  are  related  to  the  house- 
holder, except  the  spouse  of  the  householder.  Foster 
children  are  not  included  since  they  are  not  related  to  the 
householder. 


Other  Relatives— In  tabulations,  includes  any  household: 
member  related  to  the  householder  by  birth,  marriage,  or 
adoption,  but  not  included  specifically  in  another  relation- 
ship category.  In  certain  detailed  tabulations,  the  following 
categories  may  be  shown: 

Grandchild— The  grandson  or  granddaughter  of  the. 
householder. 

Brother/Sister— Ihe  brother  or  sister  of  the  house- 
holder, including  stepbrothers,  stepsisters,  and  brothers 
and  sisters  by  adoption.  Brothers-in-law  and  sisters-in- 
law  are  included  in  the  "Other  relative"  category  on  the 
questionnaire. 

Parent— The  father  or  mother  of  the  householder,  includ- 
ing a  stepparent  or  adoptive  parent.  Fathers-in-law  and 
mothers-in-law  are  included  in  the  "Other  relative" 
category  on  the  questionnaire. 

Other  Relatives — Anyone  not  listed  in  a  reported  cate- 
gory above  who  is  related  to  the  householder  by  birth, 
marriage,  or  adoption  (brother-in-law,  grandparent,  nephew, 
aunt,  mother-in-law,  daughter-in-law,  cousin,  and  so 
forth). 

Nonrelatives — Includes  any  household  member,  including 
foster  children  not  related  to  the  householder  by  birth, 
marriage,  or  adoption.  The  following  categories  may  be 
presented  in  more  detailed  tabulations: 

Roomer,  Boarder,  or  Foster  Child— Roomer,  boarder, 
lodger,  and  foster  children  or  foster  adults  of  the 
householder. 

Housemate  or  Roommate — A  person  who  is  not  related 
to  the  householder  and  who  shares  living  quarters 
primarily  in  order  to  share  expenses. 

Unmarried  Partner— A  person  who  is  not  related  to  the 
householder,  who  shares  living  quarters,  and  who  has  a 
close  personal  relationship  with  the  householder. 

Other  Nonrelatives — A  person  who  is  not  related  by 
birth,  marhage,  or  adoption  to  the  householder  and  who 
is  not  described  by  the  categories  given  above. 

When  relationship  is  not  reported  for  an  individual,  it  is 
imputed  according  to  the  responses  for  age,  sex,  and 
marital  status  for  that  person  while  maintaining  consis- 
tency with  responses  for  other  individuals  in  the  house- 
hold. (For  more  information  on  imputation,  see  Appendix 
C,  Accuracy  of  the  Data.) 

Unrelated  Individual 

An  unrelated  individual  is:  (1)  a  householder  living  alone 
or  with  nonrelatives  only,  (2)  a  household  member  who  is 
not  related  to  the  householder,  or  (3)  a  person  living  in 
group  quarters  who  is  not  an  inmate  of  an  institution.

DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


Family  Type 


Unmarried-Partner  Houseliold 


A  family  consists  of  a  householder  and  one  or  more 
other  persons  living  in  the  same  household  who  are 
related  to  the  householder  by  birth,  marriage,  or  adoption. 
All  persons  in  a  household  who  are  related  to  the  house- 
holder are  regarded  as  members  of  his  or  her  family.  A 
household  can  contain  only  one  family  for  purposes  of 
census  tabulations.  Not  all  households  contain  families 
since  a  household  may  comprise  a  group  of  unrelated 
persons  or  one  person  living  alone. 

Families  are  classified  by  type  as  either  a  "married- 
couple  family"  or  "other  family"  according  to  the  sex  of  the 
householder  and  the  presence  of  relatives.  The  data  on 
family  type  are  based  on  answers  to  questions  on  sex  and 
relationship  which  were  asked  on  a  1 00-percent  basis. 

Married-Couple  Family— k  family  in  which  the  house- 
holder and  his  or  her  spouse  are  enumerated  as  mem- 
bers of  the  same  household. 

Other  Family: 

Male  Householder,  No  Wife  Present— 1\  family  with  a 
male  householder  and  no  spouse  of  householder  present. 

Female  Householder,  No  Husband  Present— fK  family 
with  a  female  householder  and  no  spouse  of  house- 
holder present. 

Persons  Per  Family— A  measure  obtained  by  dividing  the 
number  of  persons  in  families  by  the  total  number  of 
families  (or  family  householders).  In  cases  where  the 
measure,  "persons  in  family"  or  "persons  per  family"  are 
cross-tabulated  by  race  or  Hispanic  origin,  the  race  or 
Hispanic  origin  refers  to  the  householder  rather  than  the 
race  or  Hispanic  origin  of  each  individual. 

Subfamily 

A  subfamily  is  a  married  couple  (husband  and  wife 
enumerated  as  members  of  the. same  household)  with  or 
without  never-married  children  under  1 8  years  old,  or  one 
parent  with  one  or  more  never-married  children  under  1 8 
years  old,  living  in  a  household  and  related  to,  but  not 
including,  either  the  householder  or  the  householder's 
spouse.  The  number  of  subfamilies  is  not  included  in  the 
count  of  families,  since  subfamily  members  are  counted  as 
part  of  the  householder's  family. 

Subfamilies  are  defined  during  processing  of  sample 
data.  In  selected  tabulations,  subfamilies  are  further  clas- 
sified by  type:  married-couple  subfamilies,  with  or  without 
own  children;  mother-child  subfamilies;  and  father-child 
subfamilies. 

Lone  parents  include  people  maintaining  either  one- 
parent  families  or  one-parent  subfamilies.  Married  couples 
include  husbands  and  wives  in  both  married-couple  fami- 
lies and  married-couple  subfamilies. 


An  unmarried-partner  household  is  a  household  other 
than  a  "married-couple  household"  that  includes  a  house- 
holder and  an  "unmarried  partner."  An  "unmarried  part- 
ner" can  be  of  the  same  sex  or  of  the  opposite  sex  of  the 
householder.  An  "unmarried  partner"  in  an  "unmarried- 
partner  household"  is  an  adult  who  is  unrelated  to  the 
householder,  but  shares  living  quarters  and  has  a  close 
personal  relationship  with  the  householder. 

Unmarried-Couple  Household 

An  unmarried-couple  household  is  composed  of  two 
unrelated  adults  of  the  opposite  sex  (one  of  whom  is  the 
householder)  who  share  a  housing  unit  with  or  without  the 
presence  of  children  under  1 5  years  old. 

Foster  Children 

Foster  children  are  nonrelatives  of  the  householder  and 
are  included  in  the  category,  "Roomer,  boarder,  or  foster 
child"  on  the  questionnaire.  Foster  children  are  identified 
as  persons  under  18  years  old  and  living  in  households 
that  have  no  nonrelatives  1 8  years  old  and  over  (who  might 
be  parents  of  the  nonrelatives  under  18  years  old). 

Stepfamily 

A  stepfamily  is  a  "married-couple  family"  with  at  least 
one  stepchild  of  the  householder  present,  where  the 
householder  is  the  husband. 

Comparability— The  1990  definition  of  a  household  is  the 
same  as  that  used  in  1 980.  The  1 980  relationship  category 
"Son/daughter"  has  been  replaced  by  two  categories, 
"Natural-born  or  adopted  son/daughter"  and  "Stepson/ 
stepdaughter."  "Grandchild"  has  been  added  as  a  sepa- 
rate category.  The  1980  nonrelative  categories:  "Roomer, 
boarder"  and  "Partner,  roommate"  have  been  replaced  by 
the  categories  "Roomer,  boarder,  or  foster  child,"  "House- 
mate, roommate,"  and  "Unmarried  partner."  The  1980 
nonrelative  category  "Paid  employee"  has  been  dropped. 

INCOME  IN  1989 

The  data  on  income  in  1 989  were  derived  from  answers 
to  questionnaire  items  32  and  33.  Information  on  money 
income  received  in  the  calendar  year  1 989  was  requested 
from  persons  15  years  old  and  over.  "Total  income"  is  the 
algebraic  sum  of  the  amounts  reported  separately  for 
wage  or  salary  income;  net  nonfarm  self-employment 
income;  net  farm  self-employment  income;  interest,  divi- 
dend, or  net  rental  or  royalty  income;  Social  Security  or 
railroad  retirement  income;  public  assistance  or  welfare 
income;  retirement  or  disability  income;  and  all  other 
income.  "Earnings"  is  defined  as  the  algebraic  sum  of 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


B-15 


wage  or  salary  income  and  net  income  from  farm  and 
nonfarm  self-employment.  "Earnings"  represent  the  amount 
of  income  received  regularly  before  deductions  for  per- 
sonal income  taxes,  Social  Security,  bond  purchases, 
union  dues,  medicare  deductions,  etc. 

Receipts  from  the  following  sources  are  not  included  as 
income:  money  received  from  the  sale  of  property  (unless 
the  recipient  was  engaged  in  the  business  of  selling  such 
property);  the  value  of  income  "in  kind"  from  food  stamps, 
public  housing  subsidies,  medical  care,  employer  contribu- 
tions for  persons,  etc.;  withdrawal  of  bank  deposits;  money 
borrowed;  tax  refunds;  exchange  of  money  between  rela- 
tives living  in  the  same  household;  gifts  and  lump-sum 
inheritances,  insurance  payments,  and  other  types  of 
lump-sum  receipts. 

Income  Type  in  1989 

The  eight  types  of  income  reported  in  the  census  are 
defined  as  follows: 

1.  Wage  or  Salary  /ncome— Includes  total  money  earn- 
ings received  for  work  performed  as  an  employee 
during  the  calendar  year  1989.  It  includes  wages, 
salary.  Armed  Forces  pay,  commissions,  tips,  piece- 
rate  payments,  and  cash  bonuses  earned  before 
deductions  were  made  for  taxes,  bonds,  pensions, 
union  dues,  etc. 

2.  Nonfarm  Self-Employment  Income— \r\c\u6es  net  money 
income  (gross  receipts  minus  expenses)  from  one's 
own  business,  professional  enterprise,  or  partnership. 
Gross  receipts  include  the  value  of  all  goods  sold  and 
services  rendered.  Expenses  includes  costs  of  goods 
purchased,  rent,  heat,  light,  power,  depreciation  charges, 
wages  and  salaries  paid,  business  taxes  (not  personal 
income  taxes),  etc. 

3.  Farm  Self-Employment  Income— \uc\u6es  net  money 
income  (gross  receipts  minus  operating  expenses) 
from  the  operation  of  a  farm  by  a  person  on  his  or  her 
own  account,  as  an  owner,  renter,  or  sharecropper. 
Gross  receipts  include  the  value  of  all  products  sold, 
government  farm  programs,  money  received  from  the 
rental  of  farm  equipment  to  others,  and  incidental 
receipts  from  the  sale  of  wood,  sand,  gravel,  etc. 
Operating  expenses  include  cost  of  feed,  fertilizer, 
seed,  and  other  farming  supplies,  cash  wages  paid  to 
farmhands,  depreciation  charges,  cash  rent,  interest 
on  farm  mortgages,  farm  building  repairs,  farm  taxes 
(not  State  and  Federal  personal  income  taxes),  etc. 
The  value  of  fuel,  food,  or  other  farm  products  used  for 
family  living  is  not  included  as  part  of  net  income. 

4.  Interest,  Dividend,  or  Net  Rental  Income— \r\c\u(\es 
interest  on  savings  or  bonds,  dividends  from  stock- 
holdings or  membership  in  associations,  net  income 
from  rental  of  property  to  others  and  receipts  from 
boarders  or  lodgers,  net  royalties,  and  periodic  pay- 
ments from  an  estate  or  trust  fund. 


5.  Social  Security  Income— \nc\u6es  Social  Security  pen- : 
sions  and  survivors  benefits  and  permanent  disability  , 
insurance  payments  made  by  the  Social  Security . 
Administration  prior  to  deductions  for  medical  insur- , 
ance,  and  railroad  retirement  insurance  checks  from  , 
the  U.S.  Government.  Medicare  reimbursements  are 
not  included. 

6.  Public  Assistance  Income— \nc\udes:  (1)  supplemen- 
tary security  income  payments  made  by  Federal  or 
State  welfare  agencies  to  low  income  persons  who  are 
aged  (65  years  old  or  over),  blind,  or  disabled;  (2)  aid 
to  families  with  dependent  children,  and  (3)  general 
assistance.  Separate  payments  received  for  hospital 
or  other  medical  care  (vendor  payments)  are  excluded 
from  this  item. 

7.  Retirement  or  Disability  Income— \nc\udes:  (1)  retire- 
ment pensions  and  survivor  benefits  from  a  former 
employer,  labor  union,  or  Federal,  State,  county,  or  ' 
other  governmental  agency;  (2)  disability  income  from 
sources  such  as  worker's  compensation;  companies 
or  unions;  Federal,  State,  or  local  government;  and  the   ^ 
U.S.  military;  (3)  periodic  receipts  from  annuities  and  ' 
insurance;  and  (4)  regular  income  from  IRA  and  KEOGH   ' 
plans. 

8.  All  Other  Income— \nc\^^des  unemployment  compen- 
sation. Veterans  Administration  (VA)  payments,  ali- 
mony and  child  support,  contributions  received  period- 
ically from  persons  not  living  in  the  household,  military    < 
family  allotments,  net  gambling  winnings,  and  other    ' 
kinds  of  periodic  income  other  than  earnings. 

Income  of  Households—Includes  the  income  of  the 
householder  and  all  other  persons  1 5  years  old  and  over  in 
the  household,  whether  related  to  the  householder  or  not. 
Because  many  households  consist  of  only  one  person, 
average  household  income  is  usually  less  than  average 
family  income. 

Income  of  Families  and  Persons— In  compiling  statistics 
on  family  income,  the  incomes  of  all  members  1 5  years  old 
and  over  in  each  family  are  summed  and  treated  as  a 
single  amount.  However,  for  persons  15  years  old  and 
over,  the  total  amounts  of  their  own  incomes  are  used. 
Although  the  income  statistics  covered  the  calendar  year 
1 989,  the  characteristics  of  persons  and  the  composition 
of  families  refer  to  the  time  of  enumeration  (April  1990). 
Thus,  the  income  of  the  family  does  not  include  amounts 
received  by  persons  who  were  members  of  the  family 
during  all  or  part  of  the  calendar  year  1 989  if  these  persons 
no  longer  resided  with  the  family  at  the  time  of  enumera- 
tion. Yet,  family  income  amounts  reported  by  related 
persons  who  did  not  reside  with  the  family  during  1989  but 
who  were  members  of  the  family  at  the  time  of  enumera- 
tion are  included.  However,  the  composition  of  most 
families  was  the  same  during  1989  as  in  April  1990. 

Median  Income — The  median  divides  the  income  distribu- 
tion into  two  equal  parts,  one  having  incomes  above  the 
median  and  the  other  having  incomes  below  the  median. 


B-16 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


For  households  and  families,  the  median  income  is  based 
on  the  distribution  of  the  total  number  of  units  including 
those  with  no  income.  The  median  for  persons  is  based  on 
persons  with  income.  The  median  income  values  for  all 
households,  families,  and  persons  are  computed  on  the 
basis  of  more  detailed  income  intervals  than  shown  in 
most  tabulations.  Median  household  or  family  income 
figures  of  $50,000  or  less  are  calculated  using  linear 
interpolation.  For  persons,  corresponding  median  values 
of  $40,000  or  less  are  also  computed  using  linear  interpo- 
lation. All  other  median  income  amounts  are  derived 
through  Pareto  interpolation.  (For  more  information  on 
medians  and  interpolation,  see  the  discussion  under  "Derived 
Measures.") 

Mean  Income— This  is  the  amount  obtained  by  dividing 
the  total  income  of  a  particular  statistical  universe  by  the 
number  of  units  in  that  universe.  Thus,  mean  household 
income  is  obtained  by  dividing  total  household  income  by 
the  total  number  of  households.  For  the  various  types  of 
income  the  means  are  based  on  households  having  those 
types  of  income.  "Per  capita  income"  is  the  mean  income 
computed  for  every  man,  woman,  and  child  in  a  particular 
group.  It  is  derived  by  dividing  the  total  income  of  a 
particular  group  by  the  total  population  in  that  group. 

Care  should  be  exercised  in  using  and  interpreting  mean 
income  values  for  small  subgroups  of  the  population. 
Because  the  mean  is  influenced  strongly  by  extreme 
values  in  the  distribution,  it  is  especially  susceptible  to  the 
effects  of  sampling  variability,  misreporting,  and  process- 
ing errors.  The  median,  which  is  not  affected  by  extreme 
values,  is,  therefore,  a  better  measure  than  the  mean  when 
the  population  base  is  small.  The  mean,  nevertheless,  is 
shown  in  some  data  products  for  most  small  subgroups 
because,  when  weighted  according  to  the  number  of 
cases,  the  means  can  be  added  to  obtained  summary 
measures  for  areas  and  groups  other  than  those  shown  in 
census  tabulations. 

Limitation  of  the  Data— Since  questionnaire  entries  for 
income  frequently  are  based  on  memory  and  not  on 
records,  many  persons  tended  to  forget  minor  or  irregular 
sources  of  income  and,  therefore,  underreport  their  income. 
Underreporting  tends  to  be  more  pronounced  for  income 
sources  that  are  not  derived  from  earnings,  such  as  Social 
Security,  public  assistance,  or  from  interest,  dividends,  and 
net  rental  income. 

There  are  errors  of  reporting  due  to  the  misunderstand- 
ing of  the  income  questions  such  as  reporting  gross  rather 
than  net  dollar  amounts  for  the  two  questions  on  net 
self-employment  income,  which  resulted  in  an  overstate- 
ment of  these  items.  Another  common  error  is  the  report- 
ing of  identical  dollar  amounts  in  two  of  the  eight  type  of 
income  items  where  a  respondent  with  only  one  source  of 
income  assumed  that  the  second  amount  should  be 
entered  to  represent  total  income.  Such  instances  of 


overreporting  had  an  impact  on  the  level  of  mean  nonfarm 
or  farm  self-employment  income  and  mean  total  income 
published  for  the  various  geographical  subdivisions  of  the 
State. 

Extensive  computer  editing  procedures  were  instituted 
in  the  data  processing  operation  to  reduce  some  of  these 
reporting  errors  and  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  the  income 
data.  These  procedures  corrected  various  reporting  defi- 
ciencies and  improved  the  consistency  of  reported  income 
items  associated  with  work  experience  and  information  on 
occupation  and  class  of  worker.  For  example,  if  persons 
reported  they  were  self-employed  on  their  own  farm,  not 
incorporated,  but  had  reported  wage  and  salary  earnings 
only,  the  latter  amount  was  shifted  to  net  farm  self- 
employment  income.  Also,  if  any  respondent  reported  total 
income  only,  the  amount  was  generally  assigned  to  one  of 
the  type  of  income  items  according  to  responses  to  the 
work  experience  and  class-of-worker  questions.  Another 
type  of  problem  involved  nonreporting  of  income  data. 
Where  income  information  was  not  reported,  procedures 
were  devised  to  impute  appropriate  values  with  either  no 
income  or  positive  or  negative  dollar  amounts  for  the 
missing  entries.  (For  more  information  on  imputation,  see 
Appendix  C,  Accuracy  of  the  Data.) 

In  income  tabulations  for  households  and  families,  the 
lowest  income  group  (e.g.,  less  than  $5,000)  includes  units 
that  were  classified  as  having  no  1989  income.  Many  of 
these  were  living  on  income  "in  kind,"  savings,  or  gifts, 
were  newly  created  families,  or  families  in  which  the  sole 
breadwinner  had  recently  died  or  left  the  household. 
However,  many  of  the  households  and  families  who  reported 
no  income  probably  had  some  money  income  which  was 
not  recorded  in  the  census. 

The  income  data  presented  in  the  tabulations  covers 
money  income  only.  The  fact  that  many  farm  families 
receive  an  important  part  of  their  income  in  the  form  of 
"free"  housing  and  goods  produced  and  consumed  on  the 
farm  rather  than  in  money  should  be  taken  into  consider- 
ation in  comparing  the  income  of  farm  and  nonfarm 
residents.  Nonmoney  income  such  as  business  expense 
accounts,  use  of  business  transportation  and  facilities,  or 
partial  compensation  by  business  for  medical  and  educa- 
tional expenses  was  also  received  by  some  nonfarm 
residents.  Many  low  income  families  also  receive  income 
"in  kind"  from  public  welfare  programs.  In  comparing 
income  data  for  1989  with  earlier  years,  it  should  be  noted 
that  an  increase  or  decrease  in  money  income  does  not 
necessarily  represent  a  comparable  change  in  real  income, 
unless  adjustments  for  changes  in  prices  are  made. 

Comparability— The  income  data  collected  in  the  1980 
and  1970  censuses  are  similar  to  the  1990  census  data, 
but  there  are  variations  in  the  detail  of  the  questions.  In 
1980,  income  information  for  1979  was  collected  from 
persons  in  approximately  19  percent  of  all  housing  units 
and  group  quarters.  Each  person  was  required  to  report: 

•  Wage  or  salary  income 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


B-17 


•  Net  nonfarm  self-employment  income 

•  Net  farm  self-employment  Income 

•  Interest,  dividend,  or  net  rental  or  royalty  income 

•  Social  Security  income 

•  Public  assistance  income 

•  Income  from  all  other  sources 

Between  the  1980  and  1990  censuses,  there  were 
minor  differences  in  the  processing  of  the  data.  In  both 
censuses,  all  persons  with  missing  values  in  one  or  more 
of  the  detailed  type  of  income  items  and  total  income  were 
designated  as  allocated.  Each  missing  entry  was  imputed 
either  as  a  "no"  or  as  a  dollar  amount.  If  total  income  was 
reported  and  one  or  more  of  the  type  of  income  fields  was 
not  answered,  then  the  entry  in  total  income  generally  was 
assigned  to  one  of  the  income  types  according  to  the 
socioeconomic  characteristics  of  the  income  recipient. 
This  person  was  designated  as  unallocated. 

In  1980  and  1990,  all  nonrespondents  with  income  not 
reported  (whether  heads  of  households  or  other  persons) 
were  assigned  the  reported  income  of  persons  with  similar 
characteristics.  (For  more  information  on  imputation,  see 
Appendix  C,  "Accuracy  of  the  Data.") 

There  was  a  difference  in  the  method  of  computer 
derivation  of  aggregate  income  from  individual  amounts 
between  the  two  census  processing  operations.  In  the 
1980  census,  income  amounts  less  than  $100,000  were 
coded  in  tens  of  dollars,  and  amounts  of  $100,000  or  more 
were  coded  in  thousands  of  dollars;  $5  was  added  to  each 
amount  coded  in  tens  of  dollars  and  $500  to  each  amount 
coded  in  thousands  of  dollars.  Entries  of  $999,000  or  more 
were  treated  as  $999,500  and  losses  of  $9,999  or  more 
were  treated  as  minus  $9,999.  In  the  1990  census,  income 
amounts  less  than  $999,999  were  keyed  in  dollars.  Amounts 
of  $999,999  or  more  were  treated  as  $999,999  and  losses 
of  $9,999  or  more  were  treated  as  minus  $9,999  in  all  of 
the  computer  derivations  of  aggregate  income. 

In  1970,  information  on  income  in  1969  was  obtained 
from  all  members  in  every  fifth  housing  unit  and  small 
group  quarters  (less  than  15  persons)  and  every  fifth 
person  in  all  other  group  quarters.  Each  person  was 
required  to  report: 

•  Wage  or  salary  income 

•  Net  nonfarm  self-employment  income 

•  Net  farm  self-employment  income 

•  Social  Security  or  Railroad  Retirement 

•  Public  assistance  or  welfare  payments 

•  Income  from  all  other  sources 


If  a  person  reported  a  dollar  amount  rn  wage  or  salary, 
net  nonfarm  self-employment  income,  or  net  farm  self-  ■, 
employment  income,  the  person  was  considered  as  unal- 
located only  if  no  further  dollar  amounts  were  imputed  for 
any  additional  missing  entries. 

In  1960,  data  on  income  were  obtained  from  all  mem- 
bers in  every  fourth  housing  unit  and  from  every  fourth 
person  14  years  old  and  over  living  in  group  quarters.  Each 
person  was  required  to  report  wage  or  salary  income,  net  j 
self-employment  income,  and  income  other  than  earnings  } 
received  in  1 959.  An  assumption  was  made  in  the  editing 
process  that  no  other  type  of  income  was  received  by  a 
person  who  reported  the  receipt  of  either  wage  and  salary  , 
income  or  self-employment  but  who  had  failed  to  report  the  : 
receipt  of  other  money  income. 

For  several  reasons,  the  income  data  shown  in  census 
tabulations  are  not  directly  comparable  with  those  that 
may  be  obtained  from  statistical  summaries  of  income  tax 
returns.  Income,  as  defined  for  Federal  tax  purposes, 
differs  somewhat  from  the  Census  Bureau  concept.  More- 
over, the  coverage  of  income  tax  statistics  is  different 
because  of  the  exemptions  of  persons  having  small  amounts 
of  income  and  the  inclusion  of  net  capital  gains  in  tax 
returns.  Furthermore,  members  of  some  families  file  sep- 
arate returns  and  others  file  joint  returns;  consequently, 
the  income  reporting  unit  is  not  consistently  either  a  family 
or  a  person. 

The  earnings  data  shown  in  census  tabulations  are  not 
directly  comparable  with  earnings  records  of  the  Social 
Security  Administration.  The  earnings  record  data  for  1989 
excluded  the  earnings  of  most  civilian  government  employ- 
ees, some  employees  of  nonprofit  organizations,  workers 
covered  by  the  Railroad  Retirement  Act,  and  persons  not 
covered  by  the  program  because  of  insufficient  earnings. 
Furthermore,  earnings  received  from  any  one  employer  in 
excess  of  $48,000  in  1989  are  not  covered  by  earnings 
records.  Finally,  because  census  data  are  obtained  from 
household  questionnaires,  they  may  differ  from  Social 
Security  Administration  earnings  record  data,  which  are 
based  upon  employers'  reports  and  the  Federal  income 
tax  returns  of  self-employed  persons. 

The  Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis  (BEA)  of  the  Depart- 
ment of  Commerce  publishes  annual  data  on  aggregate 
and  per-capita  personal  income  received  by  the  population 
for  States,  metropolitan  areas,  and  selected  counties. 
Aggregate  income  estimates  based  on  the  income  statis- 
tics shown  in  census  products  usually  would  be  less  than 
those  shown  in  the  BEA  income  series  for  several  reasons. 
The  Census  Bureau  data  are  obtained  directly  from  house- 
holds, whereas  the  BEA  income  series  is  estimated  largely 
on  the  basis  of  data  from  administrative  records  of  busi- 
ness and  governmental  sources.  Moreover,  the  definitions 
of  income  are  different.  The  BEA  income  series  includes 
some  items  not  included  in  the  income  data  shown  in 
census  publications,  such  as  income  "in  kind,"  income 
received  by  nonprofit  institutions,  the  value  of  services  of

banks  and  other  financial  intermediaries  rendered  to  per- 
sons without  the  assessnnent  of  specific  charges,  IVIedi- 
care  paynnents,  and  the  income  of  persons  who  died  or 
emigrated  prior  to  April  1,  1990.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
census  income  data  include  contributions  for  support 
received  from  persons  not  residing  in  the  same  household 
and  employer  contributions  for  social  insurance. 


INDUSTRY,  OCCUPATION,  AND  CLASS  OF 
WORKER 

The  data  on  industry,  occupation,  and  class  of  worker 
were  derived  from  answers  to  questionnaire  items  28,  29, 
and  30  respectively.  These  questions  were  asked  of  a 
sample  of  persons.  Information  on  industry  relates  to  the 
kind  of  business  conducted  by  a  person's  employing 
organization;  occupation  describes  the  kind  of  work  the 
person  does  on  the  job. 

For  employed  persons,  the  data  refer  to  the  person's 
job  during  the  reference  week.  For  those  who  worked  at 
two  or  more  jobs,  the  data  refer  to  the  job  at  which  the 
person  worked  the  greatest  number  of  hours.  For  unem- 
ployed persons,  the  data  refer  to  their  last  job.  The  industry 
and  occupation  statistics  are  derived  from  the  detailed 
classification  systems  developed  for  the  1 990  census  as 
described  below.  The  Classified  Index  of  Industries  and 
Occupations  provided  additional  information  on  the  indus- 
try and  occupation  classification  systems. 

Respondents  provided  the  data  for  the  tabulations  by 
writing  on  the  questionnaires  descriptions  of  their  industry 
and  occupation.  These  descriptions  were  keyed  and  passed 
through  automated  coding  software  which  assigned  a 
portion  of  the  written  entries  to  categories  in  the  classifi- 
cation system.  The  automated  system  assigned  codes  to 
59  percent  of  the  industry  entries  and  38  percent  of  the 
occupation  entries. 

Those  cases  not  coded  by  the  computer  were  referred 
to  clerical  staff  in  the  Census  Bureau's  Kansas  City 
processing  office  for  coding.  The  clerical  staff  converted 
the  written  questionnaire  descriptions  to  codes  by  compar- 
ing these  descriptions  to  entries  in  the  Alphabetical  Index 
of  Industries  and  Occupations.  For  the  industry  code, 
these  coders  also  referred  to  an  Employer  Name  List 
(formerly  called  Company  Name  List).  This  list,  prepared 
from  the  Standard  Statistical  Establishment  List  developed 
by  the  Census  Bureau  for  the  economic  censuses  and 
surveys,  contained  the  names  of  business  establishments 
and  their  Standard  Industrial  Classification  (SIC)  codes 
converted  to  population  census  equivalents.  This  list  facil- 
itated coding  and  maintained  industrial  classification  com- 
parability. 

Industry 

The  industry  classification  system  developed  for  the 
1990  census  consists  of  236  categories  for  employed 
persons,  classified  into  13  major  industry  groups.  Since 


1940,  the  industrial  classification  has  been  based  on  the 
Standard  Industrial  Classification  Manual  (SIC).  The  1990 
census  classification  was  developed  from  the  1987  SIC 
published  by  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget, 
Executive  Office  of  the  President. 

The  SIC  was  designed  primarily  to  classify  establish- 
ments by  the  type  of  industrial  activity  in  which  they  were 
engaged.  However,  census  data,  which  were  collected 
from  households,  differ  in  detail  and  nature  from  those 
obtained  from  establishment  surveys.  Therefore,  the  cen- 
sus classification  systems,  while  defined  in  SIC  terms, 
cannot  reflect  the  full  detail  in  all  categories.  There  are 
several  levels  of  industrial  classification  found  in  census 
products.  For  example,  the  1 990  CP-2,  Social  and  Eco- 
nomic Characteristics  report  includes  41  unique  industrial 
categories,  while  the  1990  Summary  Tape  File  4  (STF  4) 
presents  72  categories. 

Occupation 

The  occupational  classification  system  developed  for 
the  1990  census  consists  of  501  specific  occupational 
categories  for  employed  persons  arranged  into  6  summary 
and  13  major  occupational  groups.  This  classification  was 
developed  to  be  consistent  with  the  Standard  Occupa- 
tional Classification  (SOC)  Manual:  1980,  published  by  the 
Office  of  Federal  Statistical  Policy  and  Standards,  U.S. 
Department  of  Commerce.  Tabulations  with  occupation  as 
the  primary  characteristic  present  several  levels  of  occu- 
pational detail.  The  most  detailed  tabulations  are  shown  in 
a  special  1990  subject  report  and  tape  files  on  occupation. 
These  products  contain  all  501  occupational  categories 
plus  industry  or  class  of  worker  subgroupings  of  occupa- 
tional categories. 

Some  occupation  groups  are  related  closely  to  certain 
industries.  Operators  of  transportation  equipment,  farm 
operators  and  workers,  and  private  household  workers 
account  for  major  portions  of  their  respective  industries  of 
transportation,  agriculture,  and  private  households.  How- 
ever, the  industry  categories  include  persons  in  other 
occupations.  For  example,  persons  employed  in  agricul- 
ture include  truck  drivers  and  bookkeepers;  persons  employed 
in  the  transportation  industry  include  mechanics,  freight 
handlers,  and  payroll  clerks;  and  persons  employed  in  the 
private  household  industry  include  occupations  such  as 
chauffeur,  gardener,  and  secretary. 

Class  of  Worker 

The  data  on  class  of  worker  were  derived  from  answers 
to  questionnaire  item  30.  The  information  on  class  of 
worker  refers  to  the  same  job  as  a  respondent's  industry 
and  occupation  and  categorizes  persons  according  to  the 
type  of  ownership  of  the  employing  organization.  The  class 
of  worker  categories  are  defined  as  follows: 

Private  Wage  and  Salary  Workers— Includes  persons 
who  worked  for  wages,  salary,  commission,  tips,  pay-in- 
kind,  or  piece  rates  for  a  private  for  profit  employer  or  a 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


B-19 


private  not-for-profit,  tax-exempt  or  charitable  organiza- 
tion. Self-ennpioyed  persons  whose  business  was  incorpo- 
rated are  included  with  private  wage  and  salary  workers 
because  they  are  paid  employees  of  their  own  companies. 
Some  tabulations  present  data  separately  for  these  sub- 
categories: "For  profit,"  "Not  for  profit,"  and  "Own  busi- 
ness incorporated." 

Employees  of  foreign  governments,  the  United  Nations, 
or  other  formal  international  organizations  were  classified 
as  "Private-not-for-profit." 

Government  Workers — Includes  persons  who  were  employ- 
ees of  any  local.  State,  or  Federal  governmental  unit, 
regardless  of  the  activity  of  the  particular  agency.  For 
some  tabulations,  the  data  were  presented  separately  for 
the  three  levels  of  government. 

Self-Empioyed  Workers — Includes  persons  who  worked 
for  profit  or  fees  in  their  own  unincorporated  business, 
profession,  or  trade,  or  who  operated  a  farm. 

Unpaid  Family  Workers— Includes  persons  who  worked 
15  hours  or  more  without  pay  in  a  business  or  on  a  farm 
operated  by  a  relative. 

Salaried/Self-Employed— In  tabulations  that  categorize 
persons  as  either  salaried  or  self-employed,  the  salaried 
category  includes  private  and  government  wage  and  salary 
workers;  self-employed  includes  self-employed  persons 
and  unpaid  family  workers. 

The  industry  category,  "Public  administration,"  is  limited 
to  regular  government  functions  such  as  legislative,  judi- 
cial, administrative,  and  regulatory  activities  of  govern- 
ments. Other  government  organizations  such  as  schools, 
hospitals,  liquor  stores,  and  bus  lines  are  classified  by 
industry  according  to  the  activity  in  which  they  are  engaged. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  class  of  worker  government 
categories  include  all  government  workers. 

Occasionally  respondents  supplied  industry,  occupa- 
tion, or  class  of  worker  descriptions  which  were  not 
sufficiently  specific  for  precise  classification  or  did  not 
report  on  these  items  at  all.  Some  of  these  cases  were 
corrected  through  the  field  editing  process  and  during  the 
coding  and  tabulation  operations.  In  the  coding  operation, 
certain  types  of  incomplete  entries  were  corrected  using 
the  Alphabetical  Index  of  Industries  and  Occupations.  For 
example,  it  was  possible  in  certain  situations  to  assign  an 
industry  code  based  on  the  occupation  reported. 

Following  the  coding  operations,  there  was  a  computer 
edit  and  an  allocation  process.  The  edit  first  determined 
whether  a  respondent  was  in  the  universe  which  required 
an  industry  and  occupation  code.  The  codes  for  the  three 
items  (industry,  occupation,  and  class  of  worker)  were 
checked  to  ensure  they  were  valid  and  were  edited  for  their 
relation  to  each  other.  Invalid  and  inconsistent  codes  were 
either  blanked  or  changed  to  a  consistent  code. 


If  one  or  more  of  the  three  codes  were  blank  after  the  ^ 
edit,  a  code  was  assigned  from  a  "similar"  person  based 
on  other  items  such  as  age,  sex,  education,  farm  or 
nonfarm  residence,  and  weeks  worked.  If  all  the  labor : 
force  and  income  data  also  were  blank,  all  these  economic 
items  were  assigned  from  one  other  person  who  provided 
all  the  necessary  data. 

Comparability— Comparability  of  industry  and  occupation 
data  was  affected  by  a  number  of  factors,  primarily  the 
systems  used  to  classify  the  questionnaire  responses.  For 
both  the  industry  and  occupation  classification  systems,  ' 
the  basic  structures  were  generally  the  same  from  1940  to  ' 
1970,  but  changes  in  the  individual  categories  limited 
comparability  of  the  data  from  one  census  to  another. 
These  changes  were  needed  to  recognize  the  "birth"  of  ' 
new  industries  and  occupations,  the  "death"  of  others, 
and  the  growth  and  decline  in  existing  industries  and 
occupations,  as  well  as,  the  desire  of  analysts  and  other 
users  for  more  detail  in  the  presentation  of  the  data. 
Probably  the  greatest  cause  of  incomparability  is  the 
movement  of  a  segment  of  a  category  to  a  different 
category  in  the  next  census.  Changes  in  the  nature  of  jobs 
and  respondent  terminology,  and  refinement  of  category 
composition  made  these  movements  necessary. 

In  the  1990  census,  the  industry  classification  had  minor 
revisions  to  reflect  recent  changes  to  the  SIC.  The  1990 
occupational  classification  system  is  essentially  the  same 
as  that  for  the  1980  census.  However,  the  conversion  of 
the  census  classification  to  the  SOC  in  1980  meant  that 
the  1 990  classification  system  was  less  comparable  to  the 
classifications  used  prior  to  the  1980  census. 

Other  factors  that  affected  data  comparability  included 
the  universe  to  which  the  data  referred  (in  1970,  the  age 
cutoff  for  labor  force  was  changed  from  14  years  to  16 
years);  how  the  industry  and  occupation  questions  were 
worded  on  the  questionnaire  (for  example,  important  changes 
were  made  in  1970);  improvements  in  the  coding  proce- 
dures (the  Employer  Name  List  technique  was  introduced 
in  1960);  and  how  the  "not  reported"  cases  are  handled. 
Prior  to  1970,  they  were  placed  in  the  residual  categories, 
"Industry  not  reported"  and  "Occupation  not  reported."  In 
1970,  an  allocation  process  was  introduced  that  assigned 
these  cases  to  major  groups.  In  1990,  as  in  1980,  the  "Not 
reported"  cases  were  assigned  to  individual  categories. 
Therefore,  the  1 980  and  1 990  data  for  individual  catego- 
ries included  some  numbers  of  persons  who  were  tabu- 
lated in  a  "Not  reported"  category  in  previous  censuses. 

The  following  publications  contain  information  on  the 
various  factors  affecting  comparability  and  are  particularty 
useful  for  understanding  differences  in  the  occupation  and 
industry  information  from  eariier  censuses:  U.S.  Bureau  of

Paper  No.  26,  1 972;  and  U.S.  Bureau  of  the  Census,  The 
Relationship  Between  the  1970  and  1980  Industry  and 
Occupation  Classification  Systems,  Technical  Paper  No. 
59,  1988.  For  citations  for  earlier  census  years,  see  the 
1980  Census  of  Population  report,  PC80-1-D,  Detailed 
Population  Characteristics. 

The  1990  census  introduced  an  additional  class  of 
worker  category  for  "private  not-for-profit"  ennployers.  This 
category  is  a  subset  of  the  1980  category  "employee  of 
private  employer"  so  there  is  no  comparable  data  before 
1990.  Also  in  1990,  employees  of  foreign  governments, 
the  United  Nations,  etc.,  are  classified  as  "private  not-for- 
profit,"  rather  than  Federal  Government  as  in  1970  and 
1980.  While  in  theory,  there  was  a  change  in  comparability, 
in  practice,  the  small  number  of  U.S.  residents  working  for 
foreign  governments  made  this  change  negligible. 

Comparability  between  the  statistics  on  industry  and 
occupation  from  the  1 990  census  and  statistics  from  other 
sources  is  affected  by  many  of  the  factors  described  in  the 
section  on  "Employment  Status."  These  factors  are  pri- 
marily geographic  differences  between  residence  and  place 
of  work,  different  dates  of  reference,  and  differences  in 
counts  because  of  dual  job  holding.  Industry  data  from 
population  censuses  cover  all  industries  and  all  kinds  of 
workers,  whereas,  data  from  establishments  often  excluded 
private  household  workers,  government  workers,  and  the 
self-employed.  Also,  the  replies  from  household  respon- 
dents may  have  differed  in  detail  and  nature  from  those 
obtained  from  establishments. 

Occupation  data  from  the  census  and  data  from  gov- 
ernment licensing  agencies,  professional  associations,  trade 
unions,  etc.,  may  not  be  as  comparable  as  expected. 
Organizational  listings  often  include  persons  not  in  the 
labor  force  or  persons  devoting  all  or  most  of  their  time  to 
another  occupation;  or  the  same  person  may  be  included 
in  two  or  more  different  listings.  In  addition,  relatively  few 
organizations,  except  for  those  requiring  licensing,  attained 
complete  coverage  of  membership  in  a  particular  occupa- 
tional field. 

JOURNEY  TO  WORK 
Place  of  Work 

The  data  on  place  of  work  were  derived  from  answers  to 
questionnaire  item  22,  which  was  asked  of  persons  who 
indicated  in  question  21  that  they  worked  at  some  time 
during  the  reference  week.  (For  more  information,  see 
discussion  under  "Reference  Week.") 

Data  were  tabulated  for  workers  16  years  and  over;  that 
is,  members  of  the  Armed  Forces  and  civilians  who  were  at 
work  during  the  reference  week.  Data  on  place  of  work 
refer  to  the  geographic  location  at  which  workers  carried 
out  their  occupational  activities  during  the  reference  week. 
The  exact  address  (number  and  street)  of  the  place  of 
work  was  asked,  as  well  as  the  place  (city,  town,  or  post 
office);  whether  or  not  the  place  of  work  was  inside  or 


outside  the  limits  of  that  city  or  town;  and  the  county.  State, 
and  ZIP  Code.  If  the  person's  employer  operated  in  more 
than  one  location,  the  exact  address  of  the  location  or 
branch  where  the  respondent  worked  was  requested. 
When  the  number  and  street  name  were  unknown,  a 
description  of  the  location,  such  as  the  building  name  or 
nearest  street  or  intersection,  was  to  be  entered. 

Persons  who  worked  at  more  than  one  location  during 
the  reference  week  were  asked  to  report  the  one  at  which 
they  worked  the  greatest  number  of  hours.  Persons  who 
regularly  worked  in  several  locations  each  day  during  the 
reference  week  were  requested  to  give  the  address  at 
which  they  began  work  each  day.  For  cases  in  which  daily 
work  did  not  begin  at  a  central  place  each  day,  the  person 
was  asked  to  provide  as  much  information  as  possible  to 
describe  the  area  in  which  he  or  she  worked  most  during 
the  reference  week. 

In  some  tabulations,  place-of-work  locations  may  be 
defined  as  "in  area  of  residence"  and  "outside  area  of 
residence."  The  area  of  residence  may  vary  from  table  to 
table  or  even  within  a  table,  and  refers  to  the  particular 
area  or  areas  shown.  For  example,  in  a  table  that  provides 
data  for  counties,  "in  area  of  residence"  refers  to  persons 
who  worked  in  the  same  county  in  which  they  lived,  while 
"outside  area  of  residence"  refers  to  persons  whose 
workplace  was  located  in  a  county  different  from  the  one  in 
which  they  lived.  Similarly,  in  a  table  that  provides  data  for 
several  types  of  areas,  such  as  the  State  and  its  individual 
metropolitan  areas  (MA's),  counties,  and  places,  the  place- 
of-work  data  will  be  variable  and  is  determined  by  the 
geographic  level  (State,  MA,  county,  or  place)  shown  in 
each  section  of  the  tabulation. 

In  tabulations  that  present  data  for  States,  workplaces 
for  the  residents  of  the  State  may  include,  in  addition  to  the 
State  itself,  each  contiguous  State.  The  category,  "in 
noncontiguous  State  or  abroad,"  includes  persons  who 
worked  in  a  State  that  did  not  border  their  State  of 
residence  as  well  as  persons  who  worked  outside  the 
United  States. 

In  tabulations  that  present  data  for  an  MSA/PMSA, 
place-of-work  locations  are  specified  to  show  the  main 
destinations  of  workers  living  in  the  MSA/PMSA.  (For 
more  information  on  metropolitan  areas  (MA's),  see  Appen- 
dix A,  Area  Classifications.)  All  place-of-work  locations  are 
identified  with  respect  to  the  boundaries  of  the  MSA/PMSA 
as  "inside  MSA/PMSA"  or  "outside  MSA/PMSA."  Loca- 
tions within  the  MSA/PMSA  are  further  divided  into  each 
central  city,  and  each  county  or  county  balance.  Selected 
large  incorporated  places  also  may  be  specified  as  places 
of  work. 

Within  New  England  MSA/PMSA's,  the  places  of  work 
presented  generally  are  cities  and  towns.  Locations  out- 
side the  MSA/PMSA  are  specified  if  they  are  important 
commuting  destinations  for  residents  of  the  MSA/PMSA, 
and  may  include  adjoining  MSA/PMSA's  and  their  central 
cities,  their  component  counties,  large  incorporated  places, 
or  counties,  cities,  or  other  geographic  areas  outside  any 
MA.   In  tabulations  for  MSA/PMSA's  in  New  England;

Honolulu,  Hawaii;  and  certain  other  MA's,  some  place-of- 
work  locations  are  identified  as  "areas"  (e.g.,  Area  1 ,  Area 
5,  Area  12,  etc.).  Such  areas  consist  of  groups  of  towns, 
cities,  census  designated  places  (Honolulu  MSA  only),  or 
counties  that  have  been  identified  as  unique  place-of-work 
destinations.  When  an  adjoining  MSA/PMSA  or  MSA/PMSA 
remainder  is  specified  as  a  place-of-work  location,  its 
components  are  not  defined.  However,  the  components 
are  presented  in  the  1990  CP-1,  General  Population  Char- 
acteristics for  Metropolitan  Areas  and  the  1990  CH-1, 
General  Housing  Characteristics  for  Metropolitan  Areas 
reports.  In  tabulations  that  present  data  for  census  tracts 
outside  MA's,  place-of-work  locations  are  defined  as  "in 
county  of  residence"  and  "outside  county  of  residence." 

In  areas  where  the  workplace  address  was  coded  to  the 
block  level,  persons  were  tabulated  as  working  inside  or 
outside  a  specific  place  based  on  the  location  of  that 
address,  regardless  of  the  response  to  question  22c 
concerning  city/town  limits.  In  areas  where  it  was  impos- 
sible to  code  the  workplace  address  to  the  block  level, 
persons  were  tabulated  as  working  in  a  place  if  a  place 
name  was  reported  in  question  22b  and  the  response  to 
question  22c  was  either  "Yes"  or  the  item  was  left  blank. 
In  selected  areas,  census  designated  places  (CDP's)  may 
appear  in  the  tabulations  as  places  of  work.  The  accuracy 
of  place-of-work  data  for  CDP's  may  be  affected  by  the 
extent  to  which  their  census  names  were  familiar  to 
respondents,  and  by  coding  problems  caused  by  similari- 
ties between  the  CDP  name  and  the  names  of  other 
geographic  jurisdictions  in  the  same  vicinity. 

Place-of-work  data  are  given  for  selected  minor  civil 
divisions  (generally,  cities,  towns,  and  townships)  in  the 
nine  Northeastern  States,  based  on  the  responses  to  the 
place-of-work  question.  Many  towns  and  townships  are 
regarded  locally  as  equivalent  to  a  place  and  therefore, 
were  reported  as  the  place  of  work.  When  a  respondent 
reported  a  locality  or  incorporated  place  that  formed  a  part 
of  a  township  or  town,  the  coding  and  tabulating  procedure 
was  designed  to  include  the  response  in  the  total  for  the 
township  or  town.  The  accuracy  of  the  place-of-work  data 
for  minor  civil  divisions  is  greatest  for  the  New  England 
States.  However,  the  data  for  some  New  England  towns, 
for  towns  in  New  York,  and  for  townships  in  New  Jersey 
and  Pennsylvania  may  be  affected  by  coding  problems 
that  resulted  from  the  unfamiliarity  of  the  respondent  with 
the  minor  civil  division  in  which  the  workplace  was  located 
or  when  a  township  and  a  city  or  borough  of  the  same  or 
similar  name  are  located  close  together. 

Place-of-work  data  may  show  a  few  workers  who  made 
unlikely  daily  work  trips  (e.g.,  workers  who  lived  in  New 
York  and  worked  in  California).  This  result  is  attributable  to 
persons  who  worked  during  the  reference  week  at  a 
location  that  was  different  from  their  usual  place  of  work, 
such  as  persons  away  from  home  on  business. 

Comparability— The  wording  of  the  question  on  place  of 
work  was  substantially  the  same  in  the  1 990  census  as  it 
was  in  1980.  However,  data  on  place  of  work  from  the 


1 990  census  are  based  on  the  full  census  sample,  while 
data  from  the  1980  census  were  based  on  only  about 
one-half  of  the  full  sample. 

For  the  1 980  census,  nonresponse  or  incomplete  responses 
to  the  place-of-work  question  were  not  allocated,  resulting    ■ 
in  the  use  of  "not  reported"  categories  in  the   1980    i 
publications.  However,  for  the  1990  census,  when  place  of    : 
work  was  not  reported  or  the  response  was  incomplete,  a 
work  location  was  allocated  to  the  person  based  on  their 
means  of  transportation  to  work,  travel  time  to  work, 
industry,  and  location  of  residence  and  workplace  of 
others.  The  1990  publications,  therefore,  do  not  contain  a 
"not  reported"  category  for  the  place-of-work  data. 

Comparisons  between  1980  and  1990  census  data  on  ■ 
the  gross  number  of  workers  in  particular  commuting  flows, 
or  the  total  number  of  persons  working  in  an  area,  should 
be  made  with  extreme  caution.  Any  apparent  increase  in 
the  magnitude  of  the  gross  numbers  may  be  due  solely  to 
the  fact  that  for  1990  the  "not  reported"  cases  have  been 
distributed  among  specific  place-of-work  destinations,  instead 
of  tallied  in  a  separate  category  as  in  1980. 

Limitation  of  the  Data— The  data  on  place  of  work  relate 
to  a  reference  week;  that  is,  the  calendar  week  preceding 
the  date  on  which  the  respondents  completed  their  ques- 
tionnaires or  were  interviewed  by  enumerators.  This  week 
is  not  the  same  for  all  respondents  because  the  enumer- 
ation was  not  completed  in  1  week.  However,  for  the 
majority  of  persons,  the  reference  week  for  the  1990 
census  is  the  last  week  in  March  1990.  The  lack  of  a 
uniform  reference  week  means  that  the  place-of-work  data 
reported  in  the  census  will  not  exactly  match  the  distribu- 
tion of  workplace  locations  observed  or  measured  during 
an  actual  workweek. 

The  place-of-work  data  are  estimates  of  persons  16 
years  old  and  over  who  were  both  employed  and  at  work 
during  the  reference  week  (including  persons  in  the  Armed 
Forces).  Persons  who  did  not  work  during  the  reference 
week  but  had  jobs  or  businesses  from  which  they  were 
temporarily  absent  due  to  illness,  bad  weather,  industrial 
dispute,  vacation,  or  other  personal  reasons  are  not  included 
in  the  place-of-work  data.  Therefore,  the  data  on  place  of 
work  understate  the  total  number  of  jobs  or  total  employ- 
ment in  a  geographic  area  during  the  reference  week.  It 
also  should  be  noted  that  persons  who  had  irregular, 
casual,  or  unstructured  jobs  during  the  reference  week 
may  have  erroneously  reported  themselves  as  not  work- 
ing. 

The  address  where  the  individual  worked  most  often 
during  the  reference  week  was  recorded  on  the  census 
questionnaire.  If  a  worker  held  two  jobs,  only  data  about 
the  primary  job  (the  one  worked  the  greatest  number  of 
hours  during  the  preceding  week)  was  requested.  Persons 
who  regularly  worked  in  several  locations  during  the  refer- 
ence week  were  requested  to  give  the  address  at  which 
they  began  work  each  day.  For  cases  in  which  daily  work 
was  not  begun  at  a  central  place  each  day.  the  person  was 


B-22 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


asked  to  provide  as  much  information  as  possible  to 
describe  the  area  in  which  he  or  she  worked  most  during 
the  reference  week. 

Means  of  Transportation  to  Work 

The  data  on  means  of  transportation  to  work  were 
derived  from  answers  to  questionnaire  item  23a,  which 
was  asked  of  persons  who  indicated  in  question  21  that 
they  worked  at  some  time  during  the  reference  week.  (For 
more  information,  see  discussion  under  "Reference  Week.") 
l\/leans  of  transportation  to  work  refers  to  the  principal 
mode  of  travel  or  type  of  conveyance  that  the  person 
usually  used  to  get  from  home  to  work  during  the  reference 
week. 

Persons  who  used  different  means  of  transportation  on 
different  days  of  the  week  were  asked  to  specify  the  one 
they  used  most  often,  that  is,  the  greatest  number  of  days. 
Persons  who  used  more  than  one  means  of  transportation 
to  get  to  work  each  day  were  asked  to  report  the  one  used 
for  the  longest  distance  during  the  work  trip.  The  category, 
"Car,  truck,  or  van,"  includes  workers  using  a  car  (includ- 
ing company  cars  but  excluding  taxicabs),  a  truck  of 
one-ton  capacity  or  less,  or  a  van.  The  category,  "Public 
transportation,"  includes  workers  who  used  a  bus  or  trolley 
bus,  streetcar  or  trolley  car,  subway  or  elevated,  railroad, 
ferryboat,  or  taxicab  even  if  each  mode  is  not  shown 
separately  in  the  tabulation.  The  category,  "Other  means," 
includes  workers  who  used  a  mode  of  travel  which  is  not 
identified  separately  within  the  data  distribution.  The  cate- 
gory, "Other  means,"  may  vary  from  table  to  table,  depend- 
ing on  the  amount  of  detail  shown  in  a  particular  distribu- 
tion. 

The  means  of  transportation  data  for  some  areas  may 
show  workers  using  modes  of  public  transportation  that 
are  not  available  in  those  areas  (e.g.,  subway  or  elevated 
riders  in  an  MA  where  there  actually  is  no  subway  or 
elevated  service).  This  result  is  largely  due  to  persons  who 
worked  during  the  reference  week  at  a  location  that  was 
different  from  their  usual  place  of  work  (such  as  persons 
away  from  home  on  business  in  an  area  where  subway 
service  was  available)  and  persons  who  used  more  than 
one  means  of  transportation  each  day  but  whose  principal 
means  was  unavailable  where  they  lived  (for  example, 
residents  of  nonmetropolitan  areas  who  drove  to  the  fringe 
of  an  MA  and  took  the  commuter  railroad  most  of  the 
distance  to  work). 

Private  Veliicle  Occupancy 

The  data  on  private  vehicle  occupancy  were  derived 
from  answers  to  questionnaire  item  23b.  This  question  was 
asked  of  persons  who  indicated  in  question  21  that  they 
worked  at  some  time  during  the  reference  week  and  who 
reported  in  question  23a  that  their  means  of  transportation 
to  work  was  "Car,  truck,  or  van."  (For  more  information, 
see  discussion  under  "Reference  Week.") 


Private  vehicle  occupancy  refers  to  the  number  of 
persons  who  usually  rode  to  work  in  the  vehicle  during  the 
reference  week.  The  category,  "Drove  alone,"  includes 
persons  who  usually  drove  alone  to  work  as  well  as 
persons  who  were  driven  to  work  by  someone  who  then 
drove  back  home  or  to  a  nonwork  destination.  The  cate- 
gory, "Carpooled,"  includes  workers  who  reported  that  two 
or  more  persons  usually  rode  to  work  in  the  vehicle  during 
the  reference  week. 

Persons  Per  Car,  Truck,  or  Van— This  is  obtained  by 
dividing  the  number  of  persons  who  reported  using  a  car, 
truck,  or  van  to  get  to  work  by  the  number  of  such  vehicles 
that  they  used.  The  number  of  vehicles  used  is  derived  by 
counting  each  person  who  drove  alone  as  one  vehicle, 
each  person  who  reported  being  in  a  two-person  carpool 
as  one-half  vehicle,  each  person  who  reported  being  in  a 
three-person  carpool  as  one-third  vehicle,  and  so  on,  and 
then  summing  all  the  vehicles. 

Time  Leaving  Home  to  Go  to  Work 

The  data  on  time  leaving  home  to  go  to  work  were 
derived  from  answers  to  questionnaire  item  24a.  This 
question  was  asked  of  persons  who  indicated  in  question 
21  that  they  worked  at  some  time  during  the  reference 
week  and  who  reported  in  question  23a  that  they  worked 
outside  their  home.  The  departure  time  refers  to  the  time  of 
day  that  the  person  usually  left  home  to  go  to  work  during 
the  reference  week.  (For  more  information,  see  discussion 
under  "Reference  Week.") 

Travel  Time  to  Work 

The  data  on  travel  time  to  work  were  derived  from 
answers  to  questionnaire  item  24b.  This  question  was 
asked  of  persons  who  indicated  in  question  21  that  they 
worked  at  some  time  during  the  reference  week  and  who 
reported  in  question  23a  that  they  worked  outside  their 
home.  Travel  time  to  work  refers  to  the  total  number  of 
minutes  that  it  usually  took  the  person  to  get  from  home  to 
work  during  the  reference  week.  The  elapsed  time  includes 
time  spent  waiting  for  public  transportation,  picking  up 
passengers  in  carpools,  and  time  spent  in  other  activities 
related  to  getting  to  work.  (For  more  information,  see 
discussion  under  "Reference  Week.") 

LANGUAGE  SPOKEN  AT  HOIVIE  AND  ABILITY 
TO  SPEAK  ENGLISH 

Language  Spoken  at  Home 

Data  on  language  spoken  at  home  were  derived  from 
the  answers  to  questionnaire  items  15a  and  15b,  which 
were  asked  of  a  sample  of  persons  born  before  April  1, 
1985.  Instructions  mailed  with  the  1990  census  question- 
naire stated  that  a  respondent  should  mark  "Yes"  in 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


B-23 


question  15a  if  the  person  sometimes  or  always  spoke  a 
language  other  than  English  at  home  and  should  not  mark 
"Yes"  if  a  language  was  spoken  only  at  school  or  if 
speaking  was  limited  to  a  few  expressions  or  slang.  For 
question  15b,  respondents  were  instructed  to  print  the 
name  of  the  non-English  language  spoken  at  home.  If  the 
person  spoke  more  than  one  language  other  than  English, 
the  person  was  to  report  the  language  spoken  more  often 
or  the  language  learned  first. 

The  cover  of  the  census  questionnaire  included  infor- 
mation in  Spanish  which  provided  a  telephone  number  for 
respondents  to  call  to  request  a  census  questionnaire  and 
instructions  in  Spanish.  Instruction  guides  were  also  avail- 
able in  32  other  languages  to  assist  enumerators  who 
encountered  households  or  respondents  who  spoke  no 
English. 

Questions  1 5a  and  1 5b  referred  to  languages  spoken  at 
home  in  an  effort  to  measure  the  current  use  of  languages 
other  than  English.  Persons  who  knew  languages  other 
than  English  but  did  not  use  them  at  home  or  who  only 
used  them  elsewhere  were  excluded.  Persons  who  reported 
speaking  a  language  other  than  English  at  home  may  also 
speak  English;  however,  the  questions  did  not  permit 
determination  of  the  main  or  dominant  language  of  per- 
sons who  spoke  both  English  and  another  language.  (For 
more  information,  see  discussion  below  on  "Ability  to 
Speak  English.") 

For  persons  who  indicated  that  they  spoke  a  language 
other  than  English  at  home  in  question  15a,  but  failed  to 
specify  the  name  of  the  language  in  question  15b,  the 
language  was  assigned  based  on  the  language  of  other 
speakers  in  the  household;  on  the  language  of  a  person  of 
the  same  Spanish  origin  or  detailed  race  group  living  in  the 
same  or  a  nearby  area;  or  on  a  person  of  the  same 
ancestry  or  place  of  birth.  In  all  cases  where  a  person  was 
assigned  a  non-English  language,  it  was  assumed  that  the 
language  was  spoken  at  home.  Persons  for  whom  the 
name  of  a  language  other  than  English  was  entered  in 
question  15b,  and  for  whom  question  15a  was  blank  were 
assumed  to  speak  that  language  at  home. 

The  write-in  responses  listed  in  question  1 5b  (specific 
language  spoken)  were  transcribed  onto  computer  files 
and  coded  into  more  than  380  detailed  language  catego- 
ries using  an  automated  coding  system.  The  automated 
procedure  compared  write-in  responses  reported  by  respon- 
dents with  entries  in  a  computer  dictionary,  which  initially 
contained  approximately  2,000  language  names.  The  dic- 
tionary was  updated  with  a  large  number  of  new  names, 
variations  in  spelling,  and  a  small  number  of  residual 
categories.  Each  write-in  response  was  given  a  numeric 
code  that  was  associated  with  one  of  the  detailed  catego- 
ries in  the  dictionary.  If  the  respondent  listed  more  than 
one  non-English  language,  only  the  first  was  coded. 

The  write-in  responses  represented  the  names  people 
used  for  languages  they  speak.  They  may  not  match  the 
names  or  categories  used  by  linguists.  The  sets  of  cate- 
gories used  are  sometimes  geographic  and  sometimes 
linguistic.  Figure  1  provides  an  illustration  of  the  content  of 


the  classification  schemes  used  to  present  language  data.

sion, U.S.  Bureau  of  the  Census,  Washington,  DC  20233. 

Household  Language — In  households  where  one  or  more 
persons  (age  5  years  old  or  over)  speak  a  language  other 
than  English,  the  household  language  assigned  to  all 
household  members  is  the  non-English  language  spoken 
by  the  first  person  with  a  non-English  language  in  the 
following  order:  householder,  spouse,  parent,  sibling,  child, 
grandchild,  other  relative,  stepchild,  unmarried  partner, 
housemate  or  roommate,  roomer,  boarder,  or  foster  child, 
or  other  nonrelative.  Thus,  persons  who  speak  only  English 
may  have  a  non-English  household  language  assigned  to 
them  in  tabulations  of  persons  by  household  language.

Ability  to  Spealt  English 

Persons  5  years  old  and  over  who  reported  that  they 
spoke  a  language  other  than  English  in  question  15a  were 
also  asked  in  question  15c  to  indicate  their  ability  to  speak 
English  based  on  one  of  the  following  categories:  "Very 
well,"  "Well,"  "Not  well,"  or  "Not  at  all." 

I        The  data  on  ability  to  speak  English  represent  the 

j    person's  own  perception  about  his  or  her  own  ability  or, 

'    because  census  questionnaires  are  usually  completed  by 

I    one  household  member,  the  responses  may  represent  the 

perception  of  another  household  member.  The  instruction 

guides  and  questionnaires  that  were  mailed  to  households 

did  not  include  any  information  on  how  to  interpret  the 

j    response  categories  in  question  1 5c. 

Persons  who  reported  that  they  spoke  a  language  other 
than  English  at  home  but  whose  ability  to  speak  English 
I  was  not  reported,  were  assigned  the  English-language 
ability  of  a  randomly  selected  person  of  the  same  age, 
Spanish  origin,  nativity  and  year  of  entry,  and  language 
group. 

Linguistic  Isolation — A  household  in  which  no  person 
I  age  14  years  or  over  speaks  only  English  and  no  person 
age  14  years  or  over  who  speaks  a  language  other  than 
English  speaks  English  "Very  well"  is  classified  as  "lin- 
guistically isolated."  All  the  members  of  a  linguistically 
isolated  household  are  tabulated  as  linguistically  isolated, 
including  members  under  age  14  years  who  may  speak 
only  English. 

Limitation  of  the  Data — Persons  who  speak  a  language 
other  than  English  at  home  may  have  first  learned  that 
language  at  school.  However,  these  persons  would  be 
expected  to  indicate  that  they  spoke  English  "Very  well." 
Persons  who  speak  a  language  other  than  English,  but  do 
not  do  so  at  home,  should  have  been  reported  as  not 
speaking  a  language  other  than  English  at  home. 

The  extreme  detail  in  which  language  names  were 
coded  may  give  a  false  impression  of  the  linguistic  preci- 
sion of  these  data.  The  names  used  by  speakers  of  a 
language  to  identify  it  may  reflect  ethnic,  geographic,  or 
political  affiliations  and  do  not  necessarily  respect  linguis- 
tic distinctions.  The  categories  shown  in  the  tabulations 
were  chosen  on  a  number  of  criteria,  such  as  information 
about  the  number  of  speakers  of  each  language  that  might 
be  expected  in  a  sample  of  the  United  States  population. 

Comparability — Information  on  language  has  been  col- 
lected in  every  census  since  1890.  The  comparability  of 
data  among  censuses  is  limited  by  changes  in  question 
wording,  by  the  subpopulations  to  whom  the  question  was 
addressed,  and  by  the  detail  that  was  published. 

The  same  question  on  language  was  asked  in  the  1980 
and  1990  censuses.  This  question  on  the  current  language 
spoken  at  home  replaced  the  questions  asked  in  prior 


censuses  on  mother  tongue;  that  is,  the  language  other 
than  English  spoken  in  the  person's  home  when  he  or  she 
was  a  child;  one's  first  language;  or  the  language  spoken 
before  immigrating  to  the  United  States.  The  censuses  of 
1910-1940,  1960  and  1970  included  questions  on  mother 
tongue.  A  change  in  coding  procedure  from  1980  to  1990 
should  have  improved  accuracy  of  coding  and  may  affect 
the  number  of  persons  reported  in  some  of  the  380  plus 
categories.  It  should  not  greatly  affect  the  4-group  or  25- 
group  lists.  In  1980,  coding  clerks  supplied  numeric  codes 
for  the  written  entries  on  each  questionnaire  using  a  2,000 
name  reference  list.  In  1990  written  entries  were  tran- 
scribed to  a  computer  file  and  matched  to  a  computer 
dictionary  which  began  with  the  2,000  name  list,  but 
expanded  as  unmatched  names  were  referred  to  head- 
quarters specialists  for  resolution. 

The  question  on  ability  to  speak  English  was  asked  for 
the  first  time  in  1980.  In  tabulations  from  1980,  the 
categories  "Very  well"  and  "Well"  were  combined.  Data 
from  other  surveys  suggested  a  major  difference  between 
the  category  "Very  well"  and  the  remaining  categories.  In 
tabulations  showing  ability  to  speak  English,  persons  who 
reported  that  they  spoke  English  "Very  well"  are  pre- 
sented separately  from  persons  who  reported  their  ability 
to  speak  English  as  less  than  "Very  well." 

MARITAL  STATUS 

The  data  on  marital  status  were  derived  from  answers  to 
questionnaire  item  6,  which  was  asked  of  all  persons.  The 
marital  status  classification  refers  to  the  status  at  the  time 
of  enumeration.  Data  on  marital  status  are  tabulated  only 
for  persons  1 5  years  old  and  over. 

All  persons  were  asked  whether  they  were  "now  mar- 
ried," "widowed,"  "divorced,"  "separated,"  or  "never  mar- 
ried." Couples  who  live  together  (unmarried  persons, 
persons  in  common-law  marriages)  were  allowed  to  report 
the  marital  status  they  considered  the  most  appropriate. 

Never  Married—Includes  all  persons  who  have  never 
been  married,  including  persons  whose  only  marriage(s) 
was  annulled. 

Ever  Married— Includes  persons  married  at  the  time  of 
enumeration  (including  those  separated),  widowed,  or  divorced. 

Now  Married,  Except  Separated— Includes  persons  whose 
current  marriage  has  not  ended  through  widowhood,  divorce, 
or  separation  (regardless  of  previous  marital  history).  The 
category  may  also  include  couples  who  live  together  or 
persons  in  common-law  marriages  if  they  consider  this 
category  the  most  appropriate.  In  certain  tabulations, 
currently  married  persons  are  further  classified  as  "spouse 
present"  or  "spouse  absent." 

Separated— Includes  persons  legally  separated  or  other- 
wise absent  from  their  spouse  because  of  marital  discord. 
Included  are  persons  who  have  been  deserted  or  who 
have  parted  because  they  no  longer  want  to  live  together 
but  who  have  not  obtained  a  divorce. 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


B-25 


Widowed— Includes  widows  and  widowers  who  have  not 
remarried. 

Divorced— Includes  persons  who  are  legally  divorced  and 
who  have  not  remarried. 

In  selected  sample  tabulations,  data  for  married  and 
separated  persons  are  reorganized  and  combined  with 
information  on  the  presence  of  the  spouse  in  the  same 
household. 

Now  Married— All  persons  whose  current  marriage  has 
not  ended  by  widowhood  or  divorce.  This  category  includes 
persons  defined  above  as  "separated." 

Spouse  Present— Marned  persons  whose  wife  or  hus- 
band was  enumerated  as  a  member  of  the  same 
household,  including  those  whose  spouse  may  have 
been  temporarily  absent  for  such  reasons  as  travel  or 
hospitalization. 

Spouse  Absent— Married  persons  whose  wife  or  hus- 
band was  not  enumerated  as  a  member  of  the  same 
household.  This  category  also  includes  all  married  per- 
sons living  in  group  quarters. 

Separated— Dei'\r\ed  above. 

Spouse  Absent,  Other— Married  persons  whose  wife  or 
husband  was  not  enumerated  as  a  member  of  the  same 
household,  excluding  separated.  Included  is  any  person 
whose  spouse  was  employed  and  living  away  from 
home  or  in  an  institution  or  absent  in  the  Armed  Forces. 

Differences  between  the  number  of  currently  married 
males  and  the  number  of  currently  married  females  occur 
because  of  reporting  differences  and  because  some  hus- 
bands and  wives  have  their  usual  residence  in  different 
areas.  In  sample  tabulations,  these  differences  can  also 
occur  because  different  weights  are  applied  to  the  individ- 
ual's data.  Any  differences  between  the  number  of  "now 
married,  spouse  present"  males  and  females  are  due 
solely  to  sample  weighting.  By  definition,  the  numbers 
would  be  the  same. 

When  marital  status  was  not  reported,  it  was  imputed 
according  to  the  relationship  to  the  householder  and  sex 
and  age  of  the  person.  (For  more  information  on  imputa- 
tion, see  Appendix  C,  Accuracy  of  the  Data.) 

Comparability— The  1990  marital  status  definitions  are 
the  same  as  those  used  in  1 980  with  the  exception  of  the 
term  "never  married"  which  replaces  the  term  "single"  in 
tabulations.  A  general  marital  status  question  has  been 
asked  in  every  census  since  1880. 

MOBILITY  LIMITATION  STATUS 

The  data  on  mobility  limitation  status  were  derived  from 
answers  to  questionnaire  item  19a,  which  was  asked  of  a 
sample  of  persons  1 5  years  old  and  over.  Persons  were 


identified  as  having  a  mobility  limitation  if  they  had  a  health 
condition  that  had  lasted  for  6  or  more  months  and  which 
made  it  difficult  to  go  outside  the  home  alone.  Examples  of 
outside  activities  on  the  questionnaire  included  shopping 
and  visiting  the  doctor's  office. 

The  term  "health  condition"  referred  to  both  physical 
and  mental  conditions.  A  temporary  health  problem,  such 
as  a  broken  bone  that  was  expected  to  heal  normally,  was 
not  considered  a  health  condition. 

Comparability — This  was  the  first  time  that  a  question  on 
mobility  limitation  was  included  in  the  census. 


PLACE  OF  BIRTH 

The  data  on  place  of  birth  were  derived  from  answers  to 
questionnaire  item  8,  which  was  asked  on  a  sample  basis. 
The  place-of-birth  question  asked  respondents  to  report 
the  U.S.  State,  commonwealth  or  territory,  or  the  foreign 
country  where  they  were  born.  Persons  born  outside  the 
United  States  were  asked  to  report  their  place  of  birth 
according  to  current  international  boundaries.  Since  numer- 
ous changes  in  boundaries  of  foreign  countries  have 
occurred  in  the  last  century,  some  persons  may  have 
reported  their  place  of  birth  in  terms  of  boundaries  that 
existed  at  the  time  of  their  birth  or  emigration,  or  in 
accordance  with  their  own  national  preference. 

Persons  not  reporting  place  of  birth  were  assigned  the 
birthplace  of  another  family  member  or  were  allocated  the 
response  of  another  person  with  similar  characteristics. 
Persons  allocated  as  foreign  born  were  not  assigned  a 
specific  country  of  birth  but  were  classified  as  "Born 
abroad,  country  not  specified." 

Nativity — Information  on  place  of  birth  and  citizenship 
were  used  to  classify  the  population  into  two  major  cate- 
gories: native  and  foreign  born.  When  information  on  place 
of  birth  was  not  reported,  nativity  was  assigned  on  the 
basis  of  answers  to  citizenship,  if  reported,  and  other 
charactehstics. 

Native — Includes  persons  born  in  the  United  States,  Puerto 
Rico,  or  an  outlying  area  of  the  United  States.  The  small 
number  of  persons  who  were  born  in  a  foreign  country  but 
have  at  least  one  Amehcan  parent  also  are  included  in  this 
category. 

The  native  population  is  classified  in  the  following 
groups:  persons  born  in  the  State  in  which  they  resided  at 
the  time  of  the  census;  persons  born  in  a  different  State,  by 
region;  persons  born  in  Puerto  Rico  or  an  outlying  area  of 
the  U.S.;  and  persons  born  abroad  with  at  least  one 
American  parent. 

Foreign  Born — Includes  persons  not  classified  as  "Native." 
Prior  to  the  1970  census,  persons  not  reporting  place  of 
birth  were  generally  classified  as  native. 


B-26 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


The  foreign-born  population  is  shown  by  selected  area, 
country,  or  region  of  birth;  the  places  of  birth  shown  in  data 
products  were  selected  based  on  the  number  of  respon- 
dents who  reported  that  area  or  country  of  birth. 

Comparability— Data  on  the  State  of  birth  of  the  native 
population  have  been  collected  in  each  census  beginning 
with  that  of  1850.  Similar  data  were  shown  in  tabulations 
for  the  1 980  census  and  other  recent  censuses.  Nonre- 
sponse  was  allocated  in  a  similar  manner  in  1980;  how- 
ever, prior  to  1980,  nonresponse  to  the  place  of  birth 
question  was  not  allocated.  Prior  to  the  1970  census, 
persons  not  reporting  place  of  birth  were  generally  classi- 
fied as  native. 

The  questionnaire  instruction  to  report  mother's  State  of 
residence  instead  of  the  person's  actual  State  of  birth  (if 
born  in  a  hospital  in  a  different  State)  was  dropped  in  1990. 
Evaluation  studies  of  1970  and  1980  census  data  demon- 
strated that  this  instruction  was  generally  either  ignored  or 
misunderstood.  Since  the  hospital  and  the  mother's  resi- 
dence is  in  the  same  State  for  most  births,  this  change  may 
have  a  slight  effect  on  State  of  birth  data  for  States  with 
large  metropolitan  areas  that  straddle  State  lines. 

POVERTY  STATUS  IN  1989 

The  data  on  poverty  status  were  derived  from  answers 
to  the  same  questions  as  the  income  data,  questionnaire 
items  32  and  33.  (For  more  information,  see  the  discussion 
under  "Income  in  1989.")  Poverty  statistics  presented  in 
census  publications  were  based  on  a  definition  originated 
by  the  Social  Security  Administration  in  1 964  and  subse- 
quently modified  by  Federal  interagency  committees  in 
1969  and  1980  and  prescribed  by  the  Office  of  Manage- 
ment and  Budget  in  Directive  14  as  the  standard  to  be 
used  by  Federal  agencies  for  statistical  purposes. 

At  the  core  of  this  definition  was  the  1 961  economy  food 
plan,  the  least  costly  of  four  nutritionally  adequate  food 
plans  designed  by  the  Department  of  Agriculture.  It  was 
determined  from  the  Agriculture  Department's  1955  survey 
of  food  consumption  that  families  of  three  or  more  persons 
spend  approximately  one-third  of  their  income  on  food; 
hence,  the  poverty  level  for  these  families  was  set  at  three 
times  the  cost  of  the  economy  food  plan.  For  smaller 
families  and  persons  living  alone,  the  cost  of  the  economy 
food  plan  was  multiplied  by  factors  that  were  slightly  higher 
to  compensate  for  the  relatively  larger  fixed  expenses  for 
these  smaller  households. 

The  income  cutoffs  used  by  the  Census  Bureau  to 
determine  the  poverty  status  of  families  and  unrelated 
individuals  included  a  set  of  48  thresholds  arranged  in  a 
two-dimensional  matrix  consisting  of  family  size  (from  one 
person  to  nine  or  more  persons)  cross-classified  by  pres- 
ence and  number  of  family  members  under  18  years  old 
(from  no  children  present  to  eight  or  more  children  present). 
Unrelated  individuals  and  two-person  families  were  further 
differentiated  by  age  of  the  householder  (under  65  years 
old  and  65  years  old  and  over). 


The  total  income  of  each  family  or  unrelated  individual  In 
the  sample  was  tested  against  the  approphate  poverty 
threshold  to  determine  the  poverty  status  of  that  family  or 
unrelated  individual.  If  the  total  income  was  less  than  the 
corresponding  cutoff,  the  family  or  unrelated  individual  was 
classified  as  "below  the  poverty  level."  The  number  of 
persons  below  the  poverty  level  was  the  sum  of  the 
number  of  persons  in  families  with  incomes  below  the 
poverty  level  and  the  number  of  unrelated  individuals  with 
incomes  below  the  poverty  level. 

The  poverty  thresholds  are  revised  annually  to  allow  for 
changes  in  the  cost  of  living  as  reflected  in  the  Consumer 
Price  Index.  The  average  poverty  threshold  for  a  family  of 
four  persons  was  $12,674  in  1989.  (For  more  information, 
see  table  A  below.)  Poverty  thresholds  were  applied  on  a 
national  basis  and  were  not  adjusted  for  regional,  State  or 
local  variations  in  the  cost  of  living.  For  a  detailed  discus- 
sion of  the  poverty  definition,  see  U.S.  Bureau  of  the 
Census,  Current  Population  Reports,  Series  P-60,  No.  171, 
Poverty  in  the  United  States:  1988  and  1989. 

Persons  for  Whom  Poverty  Status  is  Determined- 
Poverty  status  was  determined  for  all  persons  except 
institutionalized  persons,  persons  in  military  group  quarters 
and  in  college  dormitories,  and  unrelated  individuals  under 
1 5  years  old.  These  groups  also  were  excluded  from  the 
denominator  when  calculating  poverty  rates. 

Specified  Poverty  Levels — Since  the  poverty  levels  cur- 
rently in  use  by  the  Federal  Government  do  not  meet  all 
the  needs  of  data  users,  some  of  the  data  are  presented 
for  alternate  levels.  These  specified  poverty  levels  are 
obtained  by  multiplying  the  income  cutoffs  at  the  poverty 
level  by  the  appropriate  factor.  For  example,  the  average 
income  cutoff  at  125  percent  of  poverty  level  was  $15,843 
($12,674  X  1.25)  in  1989  for  a  family  of  four  persons. 

Weighted    Average    Thresholds    at    the     Poverty 

Level— The  average  thresholds  shown  in  the  first  column 
of  table  A  are  weighted  by  the  presence  and  number  of 
children.  For  example,  the  weighted  average  threshold  for 
a  given  family  size  is  obtained  by  multiplying  the  threshold 
for  each  presence  and  number  of  children  category  within 
the  given  family  size  by  the  number  of  families  in  that 
category.  These  products  are  then  aggregated  across  the 
entire  range  of  presence  and  number  of  children  catego- 
ries, and  the  aggregate  is  divided  by  the  total  number  of 
families  in  the  group  to  yield  the  weighted  average  thresh- 
old at  the  poverty  level  for  that  family  size. 

Since  the  basic  thresholds  used  to  determine  the  pov- 
erty status  of  families  and  unrelated  individuals  are  applied 
to  all  families  and  unrelated  individuals,  the  weighted 
average  poverty  thresholds  are  derived  using  all  families 
and  unrelated  individuals  rather  than  just  those  classified 
as  being  below  the  poverty  level.  To  obtain  the  weighted 
poverty  thresholds  for  families  and  unrelated  individuals 
below  alternate  poverty  levels,  the  weighted  thresholds 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


B-27 


shown  in  table  A  may  be  multiplied  directly  by  the  appro- 
priate factor.  The  weighted  average  thresholds  presented 
in  the  table  are  based  on  the  March  1990  Current  Popu- 
lation Survey.  However,  these  thresholds  would  not  differ 
significantly  from  those  based  on  the  1990  census. 

Income  Deficit— Represents  the  difference  between  the 
total  income  of  families  and  unrelated  individuals  below  the 
poverty  level  and  their  respective  poverty  thresholds.  In 
computing  the  income  deficit,  families  reporting  a  net 
income  loss  are  assigned  zero  dollars  and  for  such  cases 
the  deficit  is  equal  to  the  poverty  threshold. 

This  measure  provided  an  estimate  of  the  amount  which 
would  be  required  to  raise  the  incomes  of  all  poor  families 
and  unrelated  individuals  to  their  respective  poverty  thresh- 
olds. The  income  deficit  is  thus  a  measure  of  the  degree  of 
impoverishment  of  a  family  or  unrelated  individual.  How- 
ever, caution  must  be  used  in  comparing  the  average 
deficits  of  families  with  different  characteristics.  Apparent 
differences  in  average  income  deficits  may,  to  some 
extent,  be  a  function  of  differences  in  family  size. 

IVIean  Income  Deficit — Represents  the  amount  obtained 
by  dividing  the  total  income  deficit  of  a  group  below  the 
poverty  level  by  the  number  of  families  (or  unrelated 
individuals)  in  that  group. 

Comparability— The  poverty  definition  used  in  the  1990 
and  1980  censuses  differed  slightly  from  the  one  used  in 
the  1970  census.  Three  technical  modifications  were 
made  to  the  definition  used  in  the  1 970  census  as  described 
below: 

1.  The  separate  thresholds  for  families  with  a  female 
householder  with  no  husband  present  and  all  other 
families  were  eliminated.  For  the  1980  and  1990 
censuses,  the  weighted  average  of  the  poverty  thresh- 
olds for  these  two  types  of  families  was  applied  to  all 
types  of  families,  regardless  of  the  sex  of  the  house- 
holder. 


2.  Farm  families  and  farm  unrelated  individuals  no  longer 
had  a  set  of  poverty  thresholds  that  were  lower  than 
the  thresholds  applied  to  nonfarm  families  and  unre- 
lated individuals.  The  farm  thresholds  were  85  percent 
of  the  corresponding  levels  for  nonfarm  families  in  the 
1970  census.  The  same  thresholds  were  applied  to  all 
families  and  unrelated  individuals  regardless  of  resi- 
dence in  1980  and  1990. 

3.  The  thresholds  by  size  of  family  were  extended  from 
seven  or  more  persons  in   1970  to  nine  or  more  ^ 
persons  in  1980  and  1990. 

These  changes  resulted  in  a  minimal  increase  in  the 
number  of  poor  at  the  national  level.  For  a  complete 
discussion  of  these  modifications  and  their  impact,  see  the 
Current  Population  Reports,  Series  P-60,  No.  133. 

The  population  covered  in  the  poverty  statistics  derived 
from  the  1980  and  1990  censuses  was  essentially  the 
same  as  in  the  1970  census.  The  only  difference  was  that 
in  1980  and  1990,  unrelated  individuals  under  15  years  old 
were  excluded  from  the  poverty  universe,  while  in  1970, 
only  those  under  14  years  old  were  excluded.  The  poverty 
data  from  the  1960  census  excluded  all  persons  in  group 
quarters  and  included  all  unrelated  individuals  regardless 
of  age.  It  was  unlikely  that  these  differences  in  population 
coverage  would  have  had  significant  impact  when  compar- 
ing the  poverty  data  for  persons  since  the  1960  censuses. 

Current  Population  Survey — Because  of  differences  in 
the  questionnaires  and  data  collection  procedures,  esti- 
mates of  the  number  of  persons  below  the  poverty  level 
by  various  characteristics  from  the  1990  census  may 
differ  from  those  reported  in  the  March  1990  Current 
Population  Survey. 

RACE 

The  data  on  race  were  derived  from  answers  to  ques- 
tionnaire item  4,  which  was  asked  of  all  persons.  The 
concept  of  race  as  used  by  the  Census  Bureau  reflects

self-identification;  it  does  not  denote  any  clear-cut  scien- 
tific definition  of  biological  stock.  The  data  for  race  repre- 
sent self-classification  by  people  according  to  the  race 
with  which  they  most  closely  identify.  Furthernnore,  it  is 
recognized  that  the  categories  of  the  race  item  include 
both  racial  and  national  origin  or  socio-cultural  groups. 

During  direct  interviews  conducted  by  enumerators,  if  a 
person  could  not  provide  a  single  response  to  the  race 
question,  he  or  she  was  asked  to  select,  based  on 
self-identification,  the  group  which  best  described  his  or 
her  racial  identity.  If  a  person  could  not  provide  a  single 
race  response,  the  race  of  the  mother  was  used.  If  a  single 
race  response  could  not  be  provided  for  the  person's 
mother,  the  first  race  reported  by  the  person  was  used.  In 
all  cases  where  occupied  housing  units,  households,  or 
families  are  classified  by  race,  the  race  of  the  householder 
was  used. 

The  racial  classification  used  by  the  Census  Bureau 
generally  adheres  to  the  guidelines  in  Federal  Statistical 
Directive  No.  1 5,  issued  by  the  Office  of  Management  and 
Budget,  which  provides  standards  on  ethnic  and  racial 
categories  for  statistical  reporting  to  be  used  by  all  Federal 
agencies.  The  racial  categories  used  in  the  1 990  census 
data  products  are  provided  below. 

White— Includes  persons  who  indicated  their  race  as 
"White"  or  reported  entries  such  as  Canadian,  German, 
Italian,  Lebanese,  Near  Easterner,  Arab,  or  Polish. 

Black— Includes  persons  who  indicated  their  race  as 
"Black  or  Negro"  or  reported  entries  such  as  African 
American,  Afro-American,  Black  Puerto  Rican,  Jamaican, 
Nigerian,  West  Indian,  or  Haitian. 

American  Indian,  Eskimo,  or  Aleut— Includes  persons 
who  classified  themselves  as  such  in  one  of  the  specific 
race  categories  identified  below. 

American  Indian— \r\c\u6es  persons  who  indicated  their 
race  as  "American  Indian,"  entered  the  name  of  an 
Indian  tribe,  or  reported  such  entries  as  Canadian 
Indian,  French-American  Indian,  or  Spanish-American 
Indian. 

American  Indian  Tribe— Persons  who  identified  them- 
selves as  American  Indian  were  asked  to  report  their 
enrolled  or  principal  tribe.  Therefore,  tribal  data  in 
tabulations  reflect  the  written  tribal  entries  reported 
on  the  questionnaires.  Some  of  the  entries  (for 
example,  Iroquois,  Sioux,  Colorado  River,  and  Flat- 
head) represent  nations  or  reservations. 

The  information  on  tribe  is  based  on  self-identification 
and  therefore  does  not  reflect  any  designation  of 
Federally-  or  State-recognized  tribe.  Information  on 
American  Indian  tribes  is  presented  in  summary  tape 
files  and  special  data  products.  The  information  is 
derived  from  the  American  Indian  Detailed  Tribal 


Classification  List  for  the  1 990  census.  The  classifi- 
cation list  represents  all  tribes,  bands,  and  clans  that 
had  a  specified  number  of  American  Indians  reported 
on  the  census  questionnaire. 

Es/f/mo— Includes  persons  who  indicated  their  race  as 
"Eskimo"  or  reported  entries  such  as  Arctic  Slope, 
Inupiat,  and  Yupik. 

/l/ew/— Includes  persons  who  indicated  their  race  as 
"Aleut"  or  reported  entries  such  as  Alutiiq,  Egegik,  and 
Pribilovian. 

Asian  or  Pacific  Islander— Includes  persons  who  reported 
in  one  of  the  Asian  or  Pacific  Islander  groups  listed  on  the 
questionnaire  or  who  provided  write-in  responses  such  as 
Thai,  Nepali,  or  Tongan.  A  more  detailed  listing  of  the 
groups  comprising  the  Asian  or  Pacific  Islander  population 
is  presented  in  figure  2  below.  In  some  data  products, 
information  is  presented  separately  for  the  Asian  popula- 
tion and  the  Pacific  Islander  population. 

Asian— Includes  "Chinese,"  "Filipino,"  "Japanese,"  "Asian 
Indian,"  "Korean,"  "Vietnamese,"  and  "Other  Asian."  In 
some  tables,  "Other  Asian"  may  not  be  shown  separately, 
but  is  included  in  the  total  Asian  population. 

C/7//7ese— Includes  persons  who  indicated  their  race  as 
"Chinese"  or  who  identified  themselves  as  Cantonese, 
Tibetan,  or  Chinese  American.  In  standard  census  reports, 
persons  who  reported  as  "Taiwanese"  or  "Formosan" 
are  included  here  with  Chinese.  In  special  reports  on  the 
Asian  or  Pacific  Islander  population,  information  on 
persons  who  identified  themselves  as  Taiwanese  are 
shown  separately. 

Filipino — Includes  persons  who  indicated  their  race  as 
"Filipino"  or  reported  entries  such  as  Philipino,  Philipine, 
or  Filipino  American. 

Japanese— \nc\udes  persons  who  indicated  their  race 
as  "Japanese"  and  persons  who  identified  themselves 
as  Nipponese  or  Japanese  American. 

Asian  Indian— \nc\udes  persons  who  indicated  their 
race  as  "Asian  Indian"  and  persons  who  identified 
themselves  as  Bengalese,  Bharat,  Dravidian,  East  Indian, 
or  Goanese. 

Korean— \nc\udes  persons  who  indicated  their  race  as 
"Korean"  and  persons  who  identified  themselves  as 
Korean  American. 

l//eir/7a/77ese— -Includes  persons  who  indicated  their  race 
as  "Vietnamese"  and  persons  who  identified  them- 
selves as  Vietnamese  American.

such  as  Hmong,  Laohmong,  or  Mong. 

Laotian — Includes  persons  who  provided  a  write-in  response 
such  as  Laotian,  Laos,  or  Lao. 

777a/^lncludes  persons  who  provided  a  write-in  response 
such  as  Thai,  Thailand,  or  Siamese. 

Other  Asian — Includes  persons  who  provided  a  write-in 
response  of  Bangladeshi,  Burmese,  Indonesian,  Paki- 
stani, Sri  Lankan,  Amerasian,  or  Eurasian.  See  figure  2 
for  other  groups  comprising  "Other  Asian." 


Pacific  Islander— Includes  persons  who  indicated  their 
race  as  "Pacific  Islander"  by  classifying  themselves  into 
one  of  the  following  groups  or  identifying  themselves  as 
one  of  the  Pacific  Islander  cultural  groups  of  Polynesian, 
Micronesian,  or  Melanesian. 

Hawaiian— \nc\udes  persons  who  indicated  their  race  as 
"Hawaiian"  as  well  as  persons  who  identified  them- 
selves as  Part  Hawaiian  or  Native  Hawaiian. 


The  written  entries  under  "Indian  (Amer.)"  and  "Other 
Asian  or  Pacific  Islander  (API)"  were  reviewed  and  coded 
during  100-percent  processing  of  the  1990  census  ques- 
tionnaires. A  substantial  portion  of  the  entries  for  the 
"Other  race"  category  also  were  reviewed,  edited,  and 
coded  during  the  100-percent  processing.  The  remaining 
entries  under  "Other  race"  underwent  review  and  coding 
during  sample  processing.  Most  of  the  written  entries 
reviewed  and  coded  during  sample  processing  were  those 
indicating  Hispanic  origin  such  as  Mexican,  Cuban,  or 
Puerto  Rican. 

If  the  race  entry  for  a  member  of  a  household  was 
missing  on  the  questionnaire,  race  was  assigned  based 
upon  the  reported  entries  of  race  by  other  household 
members  using  specific  rules  of  precedence  of  household 
relationship.  For  example,  if  race  was  missing  for  the 
daughter  of  the  householder,  then  the  race  of  her  mother 
(as  female  householder  or  female  spouse)  would  be 
assigned.  If  there  was  no  female  householder  or  spouse  in 
the  household,  the  daughter  would  be  assigned  her  father's 
(male  householder)  race.  If  race  was  not  reported  for 
anyone  in  the  household,  the  race  of  a  householder  in  a 
previously  processed  household  was  assigned.  This  pro- 
cedure is  a  variation  of  the  general  imputation  procedures 
described  in  Appendix  C,  Accuracy  of  the  Data. 


Samoa/?— Includes  persons  who  indicated  their  race  as 
"Samoan"  or  persons  who  identified  themselves  as 
American  Samoan  or  Western  Samoan. 

Guamanian—\nc\udes  persons  who  indicated  their  race 
as  "Guamanian"  or  persons  who  identified  themselves 
as  Chamorro  or  Guam. 

Otfier  Pacific  islander— \r\c\u6es  persons  who  provided 
a  write-in  response  of  a  Pacific  Islander  group  such  as 
Tahitian,  Northern  Mariana  Islander,  Palauan,  Fijian,  or 
a  cultural  group  such  as  Polynesian,  Micronesian,  or 
Melanesian.  See  figure  2  for  other  groups  comprising 
"Other  Pacific  Islander." 

Other  Race— Includes  all  other  persons  not  included  in 
the  "White,"  "Black,"  "American  Indian,  Eskimo,  or  Aleut," 
and  the  "Asian  or  Pacific  Islander"  race  categories  described 
above.  Persons  reporting  in  the  "Other  race"  category  and 
providing  write-in  entries  such  as  multiracial,  multiethnic, 
mixed,  interracial,  Wesort,  or  a  Spanish/Hispanic  origin 
group  (such  as  Mexican,  Cuban,  or  Puerto  Rican)  are 
included  here. 

Written  entries  to  three  categories  on  the  race  item— 
"Indian  (Amer.),"  "Other  Asian  or  Pacific  Islander  (API)," 
and  "Other  race"— were  reviewed,  edited,  and  coded  by 
subject  matter  specialists.  (For  more  information  on  the 
coding  operation,  see  the  section  below  that  discusses 
"Comparability.") 


B-30 


Limitation  of  the  Data — In  the  1980  census,  a  relatively 
high  proportion  (20  percent)  of  American  Indians  did  not 
report  any  tribal  entry  in  the  race  item.  Evaluation  of  the 
pre-census  tests  indicated  that  changes  made  for  the  1 990 
race  item  should  improve  the  reporting  of  tribes  in  the  rural 
areas  (especially  on  reservations)  for  the  1990  census. 
The  results  for  urban  areas  were  inconclusive.  Also,  the 
precensus  tests  indicated  that  there  may  be  overreporting 
of  the  Cherokee  tribe.  An  evaluation  of  1 980  census  data 
showed  overreporting  of  Cherokee  in  urban  areas  or  areas 
where  the  number  of  American  Indians  was  sparse. 

In  the  1990  census,  respondents  sometimes  did  not  fill 
in  a  circle  or  filled  the  "Other  race"  circle  and  wrote  in  a 
response,  such  as  Arab,  Polish,  or  African  Amehcan  in  the 
shared  write-in  box  for  "Other  race"  and  "Other  API" 
responses.  Duhng  the  automated  coding  process,  these 
responses  were  edited  and  assigned  to  the  appropriate 
racial  designation.  Also,  some  Hispanic  origin  persons  did 
not  fill  in  a  circle,  but  provided  entries  such  as  Mexican  or    \ 
Puerto  Rican.  These  persons  were  classified  in  the  "Other    | 
race"  category  during  the  coding  and  editing  process. 
There  may  be  some  minor  differences  between  sample   - 
data  and  100-percent  data  because  sample  processing 
included  additional  edits  not  included  in  the  100-percent 
processing.

Comparability— Differences  between  the  1990  census 
and  earlier  censuses  affect  the  comparability  of  data  for 
certain  racial  groups  and  American  Indian  tribes.  The  1990 
census  was  the  first  census  to  undertake,  on  a  100- 
percent  basis,  an  automated  review,  edit,  and  coding 
operation  for  written  responses  to  the  race  item.  The 
automated  coding  system  used  in  the  1990  census  greatly 
reduced  the  potential  for  error  associated  with  a  clerical 
review.  Specialists  with  a  thorough  knowledge  of  the  race 
subject  matter  reviewed,  edited,  coded,  and  resolved 
inconsistent  or  incomplete  responses.  In  the  1 980  census, 
there  was  only  a  limited  clerical  review  of  the  race  responses 
on  the  100-percent  forms  with  a  full  clerical  review  con- 
ducted only  on  the  sample  questionnaires. 

Another  major  difference  between  the  1990  and  pre- 
ceding censuses  is  the  handling  of  the  write-in  responses 
for  the  Asian  or  Pacific  Islander  populations.  In  addition  to 
the  nine  Asian  or  Pacific  Islander  categories  shown  on  the 
questionnaire  under  the  spanner  "Asian  or  Pacific  Islander 
I  (API),"  the  1 990  census  race  item  provided  a  new  residual 
I   category,  "Other  API,"  for  Asian  or  Pacific  Islander  per- 

I   sons  who  did  not  report  in  one  of  the  listed  Asian  or  Pacific

Islander  groups.  During  the  coding  operation,  write-In 
responses  for  "Other  API"  were  reviewed,  coded,  and 
assigned  to  the  appropriate  classification.  For  example,  in 
1990,  a  write-in  entry  of  Laotian,  Thai,  or  Javanese  is 
classified  as  "Other  Asian,"  while  a  write-in  entry  of 
Tongan  or  Fijian  is  classified  as  "Other  Pacific  Islander."  In 
the  1990  census,  these  persons  were  able  to  identify  as 
"Other  API"  in  both  the  100-percent  and  sample  opera- 
tions. 

In  the  1980  census,  the  nine  Asian  or  Pacific  Islander 
groups  were  also  listed  separately.  However,  persons  not 
belonging  to  these  nine  groups  wrote  in  their  specific  racial 
group  under  the  "Other"  race  category.  Persons  with  a 
written  entry  such  as  Laotian,  Thai,  or  Tongan,  were 
tabulated  and  published  as  "Other  race"  in  the  100- 
percent  processing  operation  in  1 980,  but  were  reclassi- 
fied as  "Other  Asian  and  Pacific  Islander"  in  1980  sample 
tabulations.  In  1980  special  reports  on  the  Asian  or  Pacific 
Islander  populations,  data  were  shown  separately  for 
"Other  Asian"  and  "Other  Pacific  Islander." 

The  1970  questionnaire  did  not  have  separate  race 
categories  for  Asian  Indian,  Vietnamese,  Samoan,  and 
Guamanian.  These  persons  indicated  their  race  in  the 
"Other"  category  and  later,  through  the  editing  process, 
were  assigned  to  a  specific  group.  For  example,  in  1 970, 
Asian  Indians  were  reclassified  as  "White,"  while  Vietnam- 
ese, Guamanians,  and  Samoans  were  included  in  the 
"Other"  category. 

Another  difference  between  1990  and  preceding  cen- 
suses is  the  approach  taken  when  persons  of  Spanish/ 
Hispanic  origin  did  not  report  in  a  specific  race  category  but 
reported  as  "Other  race"  or  "Other."  These  persons 
commonly  provided  a  write-in  entry  such  as  Mexican, 
Venezuelan,  or  Latino.  In  the  1990  and  1980  censuses, 
these  entries  remained  in  the  "Other  race"  or  "Other" 
category,  respectively.  In  the  1970  census,  most  of  these 
persons  were  included  in  the  "White"  category. 

REFERENCE  WEEK 

The  data  on  labor  force  status  and  journey  to  work  were 
related  to  the  reference  week;  that  is,  the  calendar  week 
preceding  the  date  on  which  the  respondents  completed 
their  questionnaires  or  were  interviewed  by  enumerators. 
This  week  is  not  the  same  for  ail  respondents  since  the 
enumeration  was  not  completed  in  one  week.  The  occur- 
rence of  holidays  during  the  enumeration  period  could 
affect  the  data  on  actual  hours  worked  during  the  refer- 
ence week,  but  probably  had  no  effect  on  overall  measure- 
ment of  employment  status  (see  the  discussion  below  on 
"Comparability"). 

Comparability— The  reference  weeks  for  the  1990  and 
1980  censuses  differ  in  that  Passover  and  Good  Friday 
occurred  in  the  first  week  of  April  1 980,  but  in  the  second 
week  of  April  1990.  Many  workers  presumably  took  time 
off  for  those  observances.  The  differing  occurrence  of 

B-31 


these  holidays  could  affect  the  comparability  of  the  1990 
and  1 980  data  on  actual  hours  worked  for  some  areas  if 
the  respective  weeks  were  the  reference  weeks  for  a 
significant  number  of  persons.  The  holidays  probably  did 
not  affect  the  overall  measurement  of  employment  status 
since  this  information  was  based  on  work  activity  during 
the  entire  reference  week. 

RESIDENCE  IN  1985 

The  data  on  residence  in  1985  were  derived  from 
answers  to  questionnaire  item  14b,  which  asked  for  the 
State  (or  foreign  country),  county,  and  place  of  residence 
on  April  1,  1985,  for  those  persons  reporting  in  question 
14a  that  on  that  date  they  lived  in  a  different  house  than 
their  current  residence.  Residence  in  1985  is  used  in 
conjunction  with  location  of  current  residence  to  determine 
the  extent  of  residential  mobility  of  the  population  and  the 
resulting  redistribution  of  the  population  across  the  various 
States,  metropolitan  areas,  and  regions  of  the  country. 

When  no  information  on  residence  in  1 985  was  reported 
for  a  person,  information  for  other  family  members,  if 
available,  was  used  to  assign  a  location  of  residence  in 
1985.  All  cases  of  nonresponse  or  incomplete  response 
that  were  not  assigned  a  previous  residence  based  on 
Information  from  other  family  members  were  allocated  the 
previous  residence  of  another  person  with  similar  charac- 
teristics who  provided  complete  information. 

The  tabulation  category,  "Same  house,"  includes  all 
persons  5  years  old  and  over  who  did  not  move  during  the 
5  years  as  well  as  those  who  had  moved  but  by  1990  had 
returned  to  their  1985  residence.  The  category,  "Different 
house  in  the  United  States,"  includes  persons  who  lived  in 
the  United  States  in  1985  but  in  a  different  house  or 
apartment  from  the  one  they  occupied  on  April  1,  1990. 
These  movers  are  then  further  subdivided  according  to  the 
type  of  move. 

In  most  tabulations,  movers  are  divided  into  three 
groups  according  to  their  1 985  residence:  "Different  house, 
same  county,"  "Different  county,  same  State,"  and  "Dif- 
ferent State."  The  last  group  may  be  further  subdivided 
into  region  of  residence  in  1985.  The  category,  "Abroad," 
Includes  those  persons  who  were  residing  in  a  foreign 
country,  Puerto  Rico,  or  an  outlying  area  of  the  U.S.  in 
1985,  including  members  of  the  Armed  Forces  and  their 
dependents.  Some  tabulations  show  movers  who  were 
residing  in  Puerto  Rico  or  an  outlying  area  in  1985  sepa- 
rately from  those  residing  in  other  countries. 

In  tabulations  for  metropolitan  areas,  movers  are  cate- 
gorized according  to  the  metropolitan  status  of  their  cur- 
rent and  previous  residences,  resulting  in  such  groups  as 
movers  within  an  MSA/PMSA,  movers  between  MSA/ 
PMSA's,  movers  from  nonmetropolitan  areas  to  MSA/PMSA, 
and  movers  from  central  cities  to  the  remainder  of  an 
MSA/PMSA.  In  some  tabulations,  these  categories  are 
further  subdivided  by  size  of  MSA/PMSA,  region  of  current 
or  previous  residence,  or  movers  within  or  between  central 
cities  and  the  remainder  of  the  same  or  a  different  MSA/PMSA. 

B-32 


The  size  categories  used  in  some  tabulations  for  both 
1985  and  1990  residence  refer  to  the  populations  of  the' 
MSA/PMSA  on  April  1,  1990;  that  is,  at  the  end  of  the 
migration  interval. 

Some  tabulations  present  data  on  inmigrants,  outmi- 
grants,  and  net  migration.  "Inmigrants"  are  generally  defined 
as  those  persons  who  entered  a  specified  area  by  crossing 
its  boundary  from  some  point  outside  the  area.  In  some 
tabulations,  movers  from  abroad  are  included  in  the  num-> 
ber  of  inmigrants;  in  others,  only  movers  within  the  United; 
States  are  included. 

"Outmigrants"  are  persons  who  depart  from  a  specific 
area  by  crossing  its  boundary  to  a  point  outside  it,  but 
without  leaving  the   United  States.   "Net  migration"   iS' 
calculated  by  subtracting  the  number  of  outmigrants  from  '• 
the  number  of  inmigrants  and,  depending  upon  the  partic- 
ular tabulation,  may  or  may  not  include  movers  from- 
abroad.  The  net  migration  for  the  area  is  net  inmigration  if 
the  result  was  positive  and  net  outmigration  if  the  result 
was  negative.  In  the  tabulations,  net  outmigration  is  indi- 
cated by  a  minus  sign  (-). 

Inmigrants  and   outmigrants  for  States  include  only; 
those  persons  who  did  not  live  in  the  same  State  in  1 985 
and   1990;  that  is,  they  exclude  persons  who  moved- 
between  counties  within  the  same  State.  Thus,  the  sum  of 
the  inmigrants  to  (or  outmigrants  from)  all  counties  in  any ; 
State  is  greater  than  the  number  of  inmigrants  to  (or 
outmigrants  from)  that  State.  However,  in  the  case  of  net 
migration,  the  sum  of  the  nets  for  all  the  counties  within  a 
State  equal  the  net  for  the  State.  In  the  same  fashion,  the  [ 
net  migration  for  a  division  or  region  equals  the  sum  of  the 
nets  for  the  States  comprising  that  division  or  region,  while 
the  number  of  inmigrants  and  outmigrants  for  that  division 
or  region   is   less  than  the  sum  of  the  inmigrants  or 
outmigrants  for  the  individual  States. 

The  number  of  persons  who  were  living  in  a  different 
house  in  1985  is  somewhat  less  than  the  total  number  of 
moves  during  the  5-year  pehod.  Some  persons  in  the  same 
house  at  the  two  dates  had  moved  duhng  the  5-year  period 
but  by  the  time  of  the  census  had  returned  to  their  1 985  . 
residence.  Other  persons  who  were  living  in  a  different . 
house  had  made  one  or  more  intermediate  moves.  For 
similar  reasons,  the  number  of  persons  living  in  a  different  ^ 
county,  MSA/PMSA,  or  State  or  moving  between  nonmet- 
ropolitan areas  may  be  understated. 

Comparability — Similar  questions  were  asked  on  all  pre- 
vious censuses  beginning  in  1940,  except  the  questions  in 
1950  referred  to  residence  1  year  earlier  rather  than  5 
years  earlier.  Although  the  questions  in  the  1940  census 
covered  a  5-year  period,  comparability  with  that  census 
was  reduced  somewhat  because  of  different  definitions 
and  categories  of  tabulation.  Comparability  with  the  1 960 
and  1970  census  is  also  somewhat  reduced  because 
nonresponse  was  not  allocated  in  those  earlier  censuses. 
For  the  1980  census,  nonresponse  was  allocated  in  a 
manner  similar  to  the  1990  allocation  scheme. 

DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


SCHOOL  ENROLLMENT  AND  LABOR  FORCE 
STATUS 

Tabulation  of  data  on  enrollment,  educational  attain- 
ment, and  labor  force  status  for  the  population  16  to  19 
years  old  allows  for  calculation  of  the  proportion  of  the  age 
group  who  are  not  enrolled  in  school  and  not  high  school 
graduates  or  "dropouts"  and  an  unemployment  rate  for  the 
"dropout"  population.  Definitions  of  the  three  topics  and 
descriptions  of  the  census  items  from  which  they  were 
derived  are  presented  in  "Educational  Attainment,"  "Employ- 
ment Status,"  and  "School  Enrollment  and  Type  of  School." 
The  published  tabulations  include  both  the  civilian  and 
Armed  Forces  populations,  but  labor  force  status  is  pro- 
vided for  the  civilian  population  only.  Therefore,  the  com- 
ponent labor  force  statuses  may  not  add  to  the  total  lines 
enrolled  in  school,  high  school  graduate,  and  not  high 
school  graduate.  The  difference  is  Armed  Forces. 

Comparability— The  tabulation  of  school  enrollment  by 
labor  force  status  is  similar  to  that  published  in  1980 
census  reports.  The  1980  census  tabulation  included  a 
single  data  line  for  Armed  Forces;  however,  enrollment, 
attainment,  and  labor  force  status  data  were  shown  for  the 
civilian  population  only.  In  1970,  a  tabulation  was  included 
for  16  to  21  year  old  males  not  attending  school. 

SCHOOL  ENROLLMENT  AND  TYPE  OF  SCHOOL 

Data  on  school  enrollment  were  derived  from  answers 
to  questionnaire  item  1 1 ,  which  was  asked  of  a  sample  of 
persons.  Persons  were  classified  as  enrolled  in  school  if 
they  reported  attending  a  "regular"  public  or  private  school 
or  college  at  any  time  between  February  1,  1990,  and  the 
time  of  enumeration.  The  question  included  instructions  to 
"include  only  nursery  school,  kindergarten,  elementary 
school,  and  schooling  which  would  lead  to  a  high  school 
diploma  or  a  college  degree"  as  regular  school.  Instruc- 
tions included  in  the  1990  respondent  instruction  guide, 
which  was  mailed  with  the  census  questionnaire,  further 
specified  that  enrollment  in  a  trade  or  business  school, 
company  training,  or  tutoring  were  not  to  be  included 
unless  the  course  would  be  accepted  for  credit  at  a  regular 
elementary  school,  high  school,  or  college.  Persons  who 
did  not  answer  the  enrollment  question  were  assigned  the 
enrollment  status  and  type  of  school  of  a  person  with  the 
same  age,  race  or  Hispanic  origin,  and,  at  older  ages,  sex, 
whose  residence  was  in  the  same  or  a  nearby  area. 

Public  and  Private  School — Includes  persons  who  attended 
school  in  the  reference  period  and  indicated  they  were 
enrolled  by  marking  one  of  the  questionnaire  categories  for 
either  "public  school,  public  college"  or  "private  school, 
private  college."  The  instruction  guide  defines  a  public 
school  as  "any  school  or  college  controlled  and  supported 
by  a  local,  county.  State,  or  Federal  Government."  Schools 
supported  and  controlled  primarily  by  religious  organiza- 
tions or  other  private  groups  are  defined  as  private. 
Persons  who  filled  both  the  "public"  and  "private"  circles 
are  edited  to  the  first  entry,  "public." 


Level  of  School  In  Which  Enrolled— Persons  who  were 
enrolled  in  school  were  classified  as  enrolled  in  "prepri- 
mary  school,"  "elementary  or  high  school,"  or  "college" 
according  to  their  response  to  question  1 2  (years  of  school 
completed  or  highest  degree  received).  Persons  who  were 
enrolled  and  reported  completing  nursery  school  or  less 
were  classified  as  enrolled  in  "preprimary  school,"  which 
includes  kindergarten.  Similarly,  enrolled  persons  who  had 
completed  at  least  kindergarten,  but  not  high  school,  were 
classified  as  enrolled  in  elementary  or  high  school.  Enrolled 
persons  who  reported  completing  high  school  or  some 
college  or  having  received  a  post-secondary  degree  were 
classified  as  enrolled  in  "college."  Enrolled  persons  who 
reported  completing  the  twelfth  grade  but  receiving  "NO 
DIPLOMA"  were  classified  as  enrolled  in  high  school.  (For 
more  information  on  level  of  school,  see  the  discussion 
under  "Educational  Attainment.") 

Comparability— School  enrollment  questions  have  been 
included  in  the  census  since  1840;  grade  attended  was 
first  asked  in  1 940;  type  of  school  was  first  asked  in  1 960. 
Before  1940,  the  enrollment  question  in  various  censuses 
referred  to  attendance  in  the  preceding  six  months  or  the 
preceding  year.  In  1940,  the  reference  was  to  attendance 
in  the  month  preceding  the  census,  and  in  the  1950  and 
subsequent  censuses,  the  question  referred  to  attendance 
in  the  two  months  preceding  the  census  date. 

Until  the  1910  census,  there  were  no  instructions  limit- 
ing the  kinds  of  schools  in  which  enrollment  was  to  be 
counted.  Starting  in  1910,  the  instructions  indicated  that 
attendance  at  "school,  college,  or  any  educational  institu- 
tion" was  to  be  counted.  In  1930  an  instruction  to  include 
"night  school"  was  added.  In  the  1940  instructions,  night 
school,  extension  school,  or  vocational  school  were  included 
only  if  the  school  was  part  of  the  regular  school  system. 
Correspondence  school  work  of  any  kind  was  excluded.  In 
the  1950  instructions,  the  term  "regular  school"  was 
introduced,  and  it  was  defined  as  schooling  which  "advances 
a  persori  towards  an  elementary  or  high  school  diploma  or 
a  college,  university,  or  professional  school  degree."  Voca- 
tional, trade,  or  business  schools  were  excluded  unless 
they  were  graded  and  considered  part  of  a  regular  school 
system.  On-the-job  training  was  excluded,  as  was  nursery 
school.  Instruction  by  correspondence  was  excluded  unless 
it  was  given  by  a  regular  school  and  counted  towards 
promotion. 

In  1960,  the  question  used  the  term  "regular  school  or 
college"  and  a  similar,  though  expanded,  definition  of 
"regular"  was  included  in  the  instructions,  which  continued 
to  exclude  nursery  school.  Because  of  the  census'  use  of 
mailed  questionnaires,  the  1960  census  was  the  first  in 
which  instructions  were  written  for  the  respondent  as  well 
as  enumerators.  In  the  1970  census,  the  questionnaire 
used  the  phrase  "regular  school  or  college"  and  included 
instructions  to  "count  nursery  school,  kindergarten,  and 
schooling  which  leads  to  an  elementary  school  certificate, 
high  school  diploma,  or  college  degree."  Instructions  in  a 
separate  document  specified  that  to  be  counted  as  regular

school,  nursery  school  must  include  instruction  as  an 
important  and  integral  phase  of  its  program,  and  continued 
the  exclusion  of  vocational,  trade,  and  business  schools. 
The  1980  census  question  was  very  similar  to  the  1970 
question,  but  the  separate  instruction  booklet  did  not 
require  that  nursery  school  include  substantial  instructional 
content  in  order  to  be  counted. 

The  age  range  for  which  enrollment  data  have  been 
obtained  and  published  has  varied  over  the  censuses. 
Information  on  enrollment  was  recorded  for  persons  of  all 
ages  in  the  1930  and  1940  and  1970  through  1990;  for 
persons  under  age  30,  in  1950;  and  for  persons  age  5  to 
34,  in  1960.  Most  of  the  published  enrollment  figures 
referred  to  persons  age  5  to  20  in  the  1 930  census,  5  to  24 
in  1940,  5  to  29  in  1950,  5  to  34  in  1960,  3  to  34  in  1970, 
and  3  years  old  and  over  in  1980.  This  growth  in  the  age 
group  whose  enrollment  was  reported  reflects  increased 
interest  in  the  number  of  children  in  preprimary  schools 
and  in  the  number  of  older  persons  attending  colleges  and 
universities. 

In  the  1950  and  subsequent  censuses,  college  students 
were  enumerated  where  they  lived  while  attending  college, 
whereas  in  earlier  censuses,  they  generally  were  enumer- 
ated at  their  parental  homes.  This  change  should  not  affect 
the  comparability  of  national  figures  on  college  enrollment 
since  1940;  however,  it  may  affect  the  comparability  over 
time  of  enrollment  figures  at  sub-national  levels. 

Type  of  school  was  first  introduced  in  the  1960  census, 
where  a  separate  question  asked  the  enrolled  persons 
whether  they  were  in  a  "public"  or  "private"  school.  Since 
the  1 970  census,  the  type  of  school  was  incorporated  into 
the  response  categories  for  the  enrollment  question  and 
the  terms  were  changed  to  "public,"  "parochial,"  and 
"other  private."  In  the  1980  census,  "private,  church 
related"  and  "private,  not  church  related"  replaced  "paro- 
chial" and  "other  private." 

Grade  of  enrollment  was  first  available  in  the  1940 
census,  where  it  was  obtained  from  responses  to  the 
question  on  highest  grade  of  school  completed.  Enumer- 
ators were  instructed  that  "for  a  person  still  in  school,  the 
last  grade  completed  will  be  the  grade  preceding  the  one 
in  which  he  or  she  was  now  enrolled."  From  1 950  to  1 980, 
grade  of  enrollment  was  obtained  from  the  highest  grade 
attended  in  the  two-part  question  used  to  measure  educa- 
tional attainment.  (For  more  information,  see  the  discus- 
sion under  "Educational  Attainment.")  The  form  of  the 
question  from  which  level  of  enrollment  was  derived  in  the 
1990  census  most  closely  corresponds  to  the  question 
used  in  1940.  While  data  from  prior  censuses  can  be 
aggregated  to  provide  levels  of  enrollment  comparable  to 
the  1990  census,  1990  data  cannot  be  disaggregated  to 
show  single  grade  of  enrollment  as  in  previous  censuses. 

Data  on  school  enrollment  were  also  collected  and 
published  by  other  Federal,  State,  and  local  government 
agencies.  Where  these  data  were  obtained  from  adminis- 
trative records  of  school  systems  and  institutions  of  higher 
learning,  they  were  only  roughly  comparable  with  data  from 
population  censuses  and  household  surveys  because  of 

B-34 


differences  in  definitions  and  concepts,  subject  matter' 
covered,  time  references,  and  enumeration  methods.  At 
the  local  level,  the  difference  between  the  location  of  the 
institution  and  the  residence  of  the  student  may  affect  the 
comparability  of  census  and  administrative  data.  Differ- 
ences between  the  boundaries  of  school  districts  and 
census  geographic  units  also  may  affect  these  compari- 
sons. 

SELF-CARE  LIMITATION  STATUS 


The  data  on  self-care  limitation  status  were  derived  from ' 
answers  to  questionnaire  item  1 9b,  which  was  asked  of  a 
sample  of  persons  15  years  old  and  over.  Persons  were 
identified  as  having  a  self-care  limitation  if  they  had  a- 
health  condition  that  had  lasted  for  6  or  more  months  and 
which  made  it  difficult  to  take  care  of  their  own  personal 
needs,  such  as  dressing,  bathing,  or  getting  around  inside 
the  home. 

The  term  "health  condition"  referred  to  both  physical 
and  mental  conditions.  A  temporary  health  problem,  such 
as  a  broken  bone  that  was  expected  to  heal  normally  was 
not  considered  a  health  condition. 

Comparability — This  was  the  first  time  that  a  question  on 
self-care  limitation  was  included  in  the  census. 


SEX 

The  data  on  sex  were  derived  from  answers  to  ques- 
tionnaire item  3,  which  was  asked  of  all  persons.  For  most 
cases  in  which  sex  was  not  reported,  it  was  determined  by 
the  appropriate  entry  from  the  person's  given  name  and 
household  relationship.  Othen^/ise,  sex  was  imputed  accord- 
ing to  the  relationship  to  the  householder  and  the  age  and 
marital  status  of  the  person.  For  more  information  on 
imputation,  see  Appendix  C,  Accuracy  of  the  Data. 

Sex  Ratio— A  measure  derived  by  dividing  the  total  num- 
ber of  males  by  the  total  number  of  females  and  multiplying 
by  100. 

Comparability— A  question  on  the  sex  of  individuals  has 
been  asked  of  the  total  population  in  every  census. 

VETERAN  STATUS 

Data  on  veteran  status,  penod  of  military  service,  and 
years  of  military  service  were  derived  from  answers  to 
questionnaire  item  17,  which  was  asked  of  a  sample  of 
persons. 


Veteran  Status— The  data  on  veteran  status  were  derived  * 
from  responses  to  question  17a.  For  census  data  prod-  ■ 
ucts,  a  "civilian  veteran"  is  a  person  16  years  old  or  over  ^ 
who  had  served  (even  for  a  short  time)  but  is  not  now  ^ 

DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS  '

serving  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army,  Navy,  Air  Force, 
Marine  Corps,  or  the  Coast  Guard,  or  who  served  as  a 
Merchant  Marine  seaman  during  World  War  II.  Persons 
who  served  in  the  National  Guard  or  military  Reserves  are 
classified  as  veterans  only  if  they  were  ever  called  or 
ordered  to  active  duty  not  counting  the  4-6  months  for 
Initial  training  or  yearly  summer  camps.  All  other  civilians 
16  years  old  and  over  are  classified  as  nonveterans. 

Period  of  Military  Service— Persons  who  indicated  in 
question  1 7a  that  they  had  served  on  active  duty  (civilian 
veterans)  or  were  now  on  active  duty  were  asked  to 
indicate  in  question  1 7b  the  period  or  periods  in  which  they 
served.  Persons  serving  in  at  least  one  wartime  period  are 
classified  in  their  most  recent  wartime  period.  For  example, 
persons  who  served  both  during  the  Korean  conflict  and 
the  post-Korean  peacetime  era  between  February  1955 
and  July  1964  are  classified  in  one  of  the  two  "Korean 
conflict"  categories.  If  the  same  person  had  also  served 
during  the  Vietnam  era,  he  or  she  would  instead  be 
Included  in  the  "Vietnam  era  and  Korean  conflict"  cate- 
gory. The  responses  were  edited  to  eliminate  inconsisten- 
cies between  reported  period(s)  of  service  and  the  age  of 
the  person  and  to  cancel  out  reported  combinations  of 
periods  containing  unreasonable  gaps  (for  example,  a 
person  could  not  serve  during  World  War  I  and  the  Korean 
conflict  without  serving  during  World  War  II).  Note  that  the 
period  of  service  categories  shown  in  this  report  are 
mutually  exclusive. 

Years  of  Military  Service— Persons  who  indicated  in 
question  17a  that  they  had  served  on  active  duty  (civilian 
veterans)  or  were  now  on  active  duty  were  asked  to  report 
the  total  number  of  years  of  active-duty  service  in  question 
17c.  The  data  were  edited  for  consistency  with  responses 
to  question  17b  (Period  of  Military  Service)  and  with  the 
age  of  the  person. 

Limitation  of  the  Data— There  may  be  a  tendency  for  the 
following  kinds  of  persons  to  report  erroneously  that  they 
served  on  active  duty  in  the  Armed  Forces:  (a)  persons 
who  served  in  the  National  Guard  or  military  Reserves  but 
were  never  called  to  active  duty;  (b)  civilian  employees  or 
volunteers  for  the  USO,  Red  Cross,  or  the  Department  of 
Defense  (or  its  predecessor  Departments,  War  and  Navy); 
and  (c)  employees  of  the  Merchant  Marine  or  Public  Health 
Service.  There  may  also  be  a  tendency  for  persons  to 
erroneously  round  up  months  to  the  nearest  year  in 
question  17c  (for  example,  persons  with  1  year  8  months 
of  active  duty  military  service  may  mistakenly  report  "2 
years"). 

Comparability— Since  census  data  on  veterans  were 
based  on  self-reported  responses,  they  may  differ  from 
data  from  other  sources  such  as  administrative  records  of 
the  Department  of  Defense.  Census  data  may  also  differ 
from  Veterans  Administration  data  on  the  benefits-eligible 
population,  since  factors  determining  eligibility  for  veterans 
benefits  differ  from  the  rules  for  classifying  veterans  in  the 
census. 


The  wording  of  the  question  on  veteran  status  (17a)  for 
1990  was  expanded  from  the  veteran/not  veteran  ques- 
tion in  1980  to  include  questions  on  current  active  duty 
status  and  service  in  the  military  Reserves  and  the  National 
Guard.  The  expansion  was  intended  to  clarify  the  appro- 
priate response  for  persons  in  the  Armed  Forces  and  for 
persons  who  served  in  the  National  Guard  or  military 
Reserve  units  only.  For  the  first  time  in  a  census,  service 
during  World  War  II  as  a  Merchant  Marine  Seaman  was 
considered  active-duty  military  service  and  persons  with 
such  service  were  counted  as  veterans.  An  additional 
period  of  military  service,  "September  1980  or  later"  was 
added  in  1990.  As  in  1970  and  1980,  persons  reporting 
more  than  one  period  of  service  are  shown  in  the  most 
recent  wartime  period  of  service  category.  Question  1 7c 
(Years  of  Military  Service)  was  new  for  1990. 

WORK  DISABILITY  STATUS 

The  data  on  work  disability  were  derived  from  answers 
to  questionnaire  item  18,  which  was  asked  of  a  sample  of 
persons  15  years  old  and  over.  Persons  were  identified  as 
having  a  work  disability  if  they  had  a  health  condition  that 
had  lasted  for  6  or  more  months  and  which  limited  the  kind 
or  amount  of  work  they  could  do  at  a  job  or  business.  A 
person  was  limited  in  the  kind  of  work  he  or  she  could  do 
if  the  person  had  a  health  condition  which  restricted  his  or 
her  choice  of  jobs.  A  person  was  limited  in  the  amount  of 
work  if  he  or  she  was  not  able  to  work  full-time.  Persons 
with  a  work  disability  were  further  classified  as  "Prevented 
from  working"  or  "Not  prevented  from  working." 

The  term  "health  condition"  referred  to  both  physical 
and  mental  conditions.  A  temporary  health  problem,  such 
as  a  broken  bone  that  was  expected  to  heal  normally,  was 
not  considered  a  health  condition. 

Comparability— The  wording  of  the  question  on  work 
disability  was  the  same  in  1990  as  in  1980.  Information  on 
work  disability  was  first  collected  in  1970.  In  that  census, 
the  work  disability  question  did  not  contain  a  clause 
restricting  the  definition  of  disability  to  limitations  caused 
by  a  health  condition  that  had  lasted  6  or  more  months; 
however,  it  did  contain  a  separate  question  about  the 
duration  of  the  disability. 

WORK  STATUS  IN  1989 

The  data  on  work  status  in  1989  were  derived  from 
answers  to  questionnaire  item  31,  which  was  asked  of  a 
sample  of  persons.  Persons  16  years  old  and  over  who 
worked  1  or  more  weeks  according  to  the  criteria  described 
below  are  classified  as  "Worked  in  1989."  All  other 
persons  16  years  old  and  over  are  classified  as  "Did  not 
work  in  1989."  Some  tabulations  showing  work  status  in 
1989  include  15  year  olds;  these  persons,  by  definition,  are 
classified  as  "Did  not  work  in  1989."

Weeks  Worked  in  1989 

The  data  on  weeks  worked  in  1989  were  derived  fronn 
responses  to  questionnaire  item  31  b.  Question  31  b  (Weeks 
Worked  in  1989)  was  asked  of  persons  16  years  old  and 
over  who  indicated  in  question  31a  that  they  worked  in 
1989. 

The  data  pertain  to  the  number  of  weeks  during  1989  in 
which  a  person  did  any  work  for  pay  or  profit  (including  paid 
vacation  and  paid  sick  leave)  or  worked  without  pay  on  a 
family  farm  or  in  a  family  business.  Weeks  of  active  service 
in  the  Armed  Forces  are  also  included. 

Usual  Hours  Worked  Per  Week  Worked  In  1989 

The  data  on  usual  hours  worked  per  week  worked  in 
1989  were  derived  from  answers  to  questionnaire  item 
31c.  This  question  was  asked  of  persons  16  years  old  and 
over  who  indicated  that  they  worked  in  1989. 

The  data  pertain  to  the  number  of  hours  a  person 
usually  worked  during  the  weeks  worked  in  1989.  The 
respondent  was  to  report  the  number  of  hours  worked  per 
week  in  the  majority  of  the  weeks  he  or  she  worked  in 
1989.  If  the  hours  worked  per  week  varied  considerably 
during  1989,  the  respondent  was  to  report  an  approximate 
average  of  the  hours  worked  per  week.  The  statistics  on 
usual  hours  worked  per  week  in  1 989  are  not  necessarily 
related  to  the  data  on  actual  hours  worked  during  the 
census  reference  week  (question  21b). 

Persons  16  years  old  and  over  who  reported  that  they 
usually  worked  35  or  more  hours  each  week  during  the 
weeks  they  worked  are  classified  as  "Usually  worked  full 
time;"  persons  who  reported  that  they  usually  worked  1  to 
34  hours  are  classified  as  "Usually  worked  part  time." 

Year-Round  Full-Tlme  Workers— All  persons  16  years 
old  and  over  who  usually  worked  35  hours  or  more  per 
week  for  50  to  52  weeks  in  1989. 

Number  of  Workers  In  Family  In  1989— The  term  "worker" 
as  used  for  these  data  is  defined  based  on  the  criteria  for 
Work  Status  in  1 989. 

Limitation  of  the  Data— It  is  probable  that  the  number  of 
persons  who  worked  in  1989  and  the  number  of  weeks 
worked  are  understated  since  there  was  some  tendency 
for  respondents  to  forget  intermittent  or  short  periods  of 
employment  or  to  exclude  weeks  worked  without  pay. 
There  may  also  be  a  tendency  for  persons  not  to  include 
weeks  of  paid  vacation  among  their  weeks  worked;  one 
result  may  be  that  the  census  figures  may  understate  the 
number  of  persons  who  worked  "50  to  52  weeks." 

Comparability— The  data  on  weeks  worked  collected  in 
the  1990  census  were  comparable  with  data  from  the 
1980,  1970,  and  1960  censuses,  but  may  not  be  entirely 
comparable  with  data  from  the  1940  and  1950  censuses. 
Since  the  1960  census,  two  separate  questions  have  been 

B-36 


used  to  obtain  this  information.  The  first  identified  persons 
with  any  work  experience  during  the  year  and,  thus, 
indicated  those  persons  for  whom  the  questions  on  num- 
ber of  weeks  worked  applied.  In  1940  and  1950,  however, 
the  questionnaires  contained  only  a  single  question  on 
number  of  weeks  worked. 

In  1970,  persons  responded  to  the  question  on  weeks 
worked  by  indicating  one  of  six  weeks-worked  intervals.  In 
1 980  and  1 990,  persons  were  asked  to  enter  the  specific 

number  of  weeks  they  worked. 

i 

YEAR  OF  ENTRY 

The  data  on  year  of  entry  were  derived  from  answers  to 
questionnaire  item  10,  which  was  asked  of  a  sample  of . 
persons.  The  question,  "When  did  this  person  come  to  the  ; 
United  States  to  stay?"  was  asked  of  persons  who  indi- 
cated in  the  question  on  citizenship  that  they  were  not  born 
in  the  United  States.  (For  more  information,  see  the 
discussion  under  "Citizenship.") 

The  1990  census  questions,  tabulations,  and  census 
data  products  about  citizenship  and  year  of  entry  include 
no  reference  to  immigration.  All  persons  who  were  born 
and  resided  outside  the  United  States  before  becoming 
residents  of  the  United  States  have  a  date  of  entry.  Some 
of  these  persons  are  U.S.  citizens  by  birth  (e.g.,  persons 
born  in  Puerto  Rico  or  born  abroad  of  American  parents). 
To  avoid  any  possible  confusion  concerning  the  date  of 
entry  of  persons  who  are  U.S.  citizens  by  birth,  the  term, , 
"year  of  entry"  is  used  in  this  report  instead  of  the  term 
"year  of  immigration." 

Limitation  of  the  Data — The  census  questions  on  nativity, : 
citizenship,  and  year  of  entry  were  not  designed  to  mea- : 
sure  the  degree  of  permanence  of  residence  in  the  United  • 
States.  The  phrase,  "to  stay"  was  used  to  obtain  the  year  * 
in  which  the  person  became  a  resident  of  the  United ' 
States.  Although  the  respondent  was  directed  to  indicate 
the  year  he  or  she  entered  the  country  "to  stay,"  it  was 
difficult  to  ensure  that  respondents  interpreted  the  phrase 
correctly. 

Comparability — A  question  on  year  of  entry,  (alternately : 
called  "year  of  immigration")  was  asked  in  each  decennial 
census  from  1890  to  1930,  1970,  and  1980.  In  1980.  the 
question  on  year  of  entry  included  six  arrival  time  intervals. 
The  number  of  arrival  intervals  was  expanded  to  ten  In 
1990.  In  1980,  the  question  on  year  of  entry  was  asked  ^ 
only  of  the  foreign-born  population.  In  1990,  all  persons 
who  responded  to  the  long-form  questionnaire  and  were  ^ 
not  born  in  the  United  States  were  to  complete  the 
question  on  year  of  entry. 

HOUSING  CHARACTERISTICS 

LIVING  QUARTERS 

Living  quarters  are  classified  as  either  housing  units  or 
group  quarters.  (For  more  information,  see  the  discussion  i 
of  "Group  Quarters"  under  Population  Characteristics.) 

DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


Usually,  living  quarters  are  in  structures  intended  for 
residential  use  (for  example,  a  one-family  home,  apartment 
house,  hotel  or  motel,  boarding  house,  or  mobile  home). 
Living  quarters  also  may  be  in  structures  intended  for 
nonresidential  use  (for  example,  the  rooms  in  a  warehouse 
where  a  guard  lives),  as  well  as  in  places  such  as  tents, 
vans,  shelters  for  the  homeless,  dormitories,  barracks,  and 
old  railroad  cars. 

Housing  Units— A  housing  unit  is  a  house,  an  apartment, 
a  mobile  home  or  trailer,  a  group  of  rooms  or  a  single  room 
occupied  as  separate  living  quarters  or,  if  vacant,  intended 
for  occupancy  as  separate  living  quarters.  Separate  living 
quarters  are  those  in  which  the  occupants  live  and  eat 
separately  from  any  other  persons  in  the  building  and 
which  have  direct  access  from  outside  the  building  or 
through  a  common  hall. 

The  occupants  may  be  a  single  family,  one  person  living 
alone,  two  or  more  families  living  together,  or  any  other 
group  of  related  or  unrelated  persons  who  share  living 
arrangements.  For  vacant  units,  the  criteria  of  separate- 
ness  and  direct  access  are  applied  to  the  intended  occu- 
pants whenever  possible.  If  that  information  cannot  be 
obtained,  the  criteria  are  applied  to  the  previous  occu- 
pants. 

Both  occupied  and  vacant  housing  units  are  included  in 
the  housing  unit  inventory,  except  that  recreational  vehi- 
cles, boats,  vans,  tents,  railroad  cars,  and  the  like  are 
included  only  if  they  are  occupied  as  someone's  usual 
place  of  residence.  Vacant  mobile  homes  are  included 
provided  they  are  intended  for  occupancy  on  the  site 
where  they  stand.  Vacant  mobile  homes  on  dealers'  sales 
lots,  at  the  factory,  or  in  storage  yards  are  excluded  from 
the  housing  inventory. 

If  the  living  quarters  contains  nine  or  more  persons 
unrelated  to  the  householder  or  person  in  charge  (a  total  of 
at  least  10  unrelated  persons),  it  is  classified  as  group 
quarters.  If  the  living  quarters  contains  eight  or  fewer 
persons  unrelated  to  the  householder  or  person  in  charge, 
it  is  classified  as  a  housing  unit. 

Occupied  Housing  Units— A  housing  unit  is  classified  as 
occupied  if  it  is  the  usual  place  of  residence  of  the  person 
or  group  of  persons  living  in  it  at  the  time  of  enumeration, 
or  if  the  occupants  are  only  temporarily  absent;  that  is, 
away  on  vacation  or  business.  If  all  the  persons  staying  in 
the  unit  at  the  time  of  the  census  have  their  usual  place  of 
residence  elsewhere,  the  unit  is  classified  as  vacant.  A 
household  includes  all  the  persons  who  occupy  a  housing 
unit  as  their  usual  place  of  residence.  By  definition,  the 
count  of  occupied  housing  units  for  100-percent  tabula- 
tions is  the  same  as  the  count  of  households  or  house- 
holders. In  sample  tabulations,  the  counts  of  household 
and  occupied  housing  units  may  vary  slightly  because  of 
different  sample  weighting  methods. 


Vacant  Housing  Units— A  housing  unit  is  vacant  if  no  one 
is  living  in  it  at  the  time  of  enumeration,  unless  its  occu- 
pants are  only  temporarily  absent.  Units  temporarily  occu- 
pied at  the  time  of  enumeration  entirely  by  persons  who 
have  a  usual  residence  elsewhere  also  are  classified  as 
vacant.  (For  more  information,  see  discussion  under  "Usual 
Home  Elsewhere.") 

New  units  not  yet  occupied  are  classified  as  vacant 
housing  units  if  construction  has  reached  a  point  where  all 
exterior  windows  and  doors  are  installed  and  final  usable 
floors  are  in  place.  Vacant  units  are  excluded  if  they  are 
open  to  the  elements;  that  is,  the  roof,  walls,  windows, 
and/or  doors  no  longer  protect  the  interior  from  the 
elements,  or  if  there  is  positive  evidence  (such  as  a  sign  on 
the  house  or  in  the  block)  that  the  unit  is  condemned  or  is 
to  be  demolished.  Also  excluded  are  quarters  being  used 
entirely  for  nonresidential  purposes,  such  as  a  store  or  an 
office,  or  quarters  used  for  the  storage  of  business  sup- 
plies or  inventory,  machinery,  or  agricultural  products. 

Hotels,  l\/lotels,  Rooming  Houses,  Etc.— Occupied  rooms 
or  suites  of  rooms  in  hotels,  motels,  and  similar  places  are 
classified  as  housing  units  only  when  occupied  by  perma- 
nent residents;  that  is,  persons  who  consider  the  hotel  as 
their  usual  place  of  residence  or  have  no  usual  place  of 
residence  elsewhere.  Vacant  rooms  or  suites  of  rooms  are 
classified  as  housing  units  only  in  those  hotels,  motels,  and 
similar  places  in  which  75  percent  or  more  of  the  accom- 
modations are  occupied  by  permanent  residents. 

If  any  of  the  occupants  in  a  rooming  or  boarding  house 
live  and  eat  separately  from  others  in  the  building  and  have 
direct  access,  their  quarters  are  classified  as  separate 
housing  units. 

Staff  Living  Quarters— The  living  quarters  occupied  by 
staff  personnel  within  any  group  quarters  are  separate 
housing  units  if  they  satisfy  the  housing  unit  criteria  of 
separateness  and  direct  access;  otherwise,  they  are  con- 
sidered group  quarters. 

Comparability— The  first  Census  of  Housing  in  1940 
established  the  "dwelling  unit"  concept.  Although  the  term 
became  "housing  unit"  and  the  definition  has  been  modi- 
fied slightly  in  succeeding  censuses,  the  1990  definition  is 
essentially  comparable  to  previous  censuses.  There  was 
no  change  in  the  housing  unit  definition  between  1980  and 
1990. 

ACREAGE 

The  data  on  acreage  were  obtained  from  questionnaire 
items  H5a  and  H19a.  Question  H5a  was  asked  at  ail 
occupied  and  vacant  one-family  houses  and  mobile  homes. 
Question  HI  9a  was  asked  on  a  sample  basis  at  occupied 
and  vacant  one-family  houses  and  mobile  homes. 

Question  H5a  asks  whether  the  house  or  mobile  home 
is  located  on  a  place  of  10  or  more  acres.  The  intent  of  this 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


B-37 


item  is  to  exclude  owner-occupied  and  renter-occupied 
one-family  houses  on  10  or  more  acres  from  the  specified 
owner-  and  renter-occupied  universes  for  value  and  rent 
tabulations. 

Question  H19a  provides  data  on  whether  the  unit  is 
located  on  less  than  1  acre.  The  main  purpose  of  this  item, 
in  conjunction  with  question  HI  9b  on  agricultural  sales,  is 
to  identify  farm  units.  (For  more  information,  see  discus- 
sion under  "Farm  Residence.") 

For  both  items,  the  land  may  consist  of  more  than  one 
tract  or  plot.  These  tracts  or  plots  are  usually  adjoining; 
however,  they  may  be  separated  by  a  road,  creek,  another 
piece  of  land,  etc. 

Comparability— Question  H5a  is  similar  to  that  asked  in 
1970  and  1980.  This  item  was  asked  for  the  first  time  of 
mobile  home  occupants  in  1990.  Question  HI  9a  is  an 
abbreviated  form  of  a  question  asked  on  a  sample  basis  in 
1980.  In  previous  censuses,  information  on  city  or  subur- 
ban lot  and  number  of  acres  was  obtained  also. 


AGRICULTURAL  SALES 

Data  on  the  sales  of  agricultural  crops  were  obtained 
from  questionnaire  item  HI 9b,  which  was  asked  on  a 
sample  basis  at  occupied  one-family  houses  and  mobile 
homes  located  on  lots  of  1  acre  or  more.  Data  for  this  item 
exclude  units  on  lots  of  less  than  1  acre,  units  located  in 
structures  containing  2  or  more  units,  and  all  vacant  units. 
This  item  refers  to  the  total  amount  (before  taxes  and 
expenses)  received  in  1 989  from  the  sale  of  crops,  vege- 
tables, fruits,  nuts,  livestock  and  livestock  products,  and 
nursery  and  forest  products,  produced  on  "this  property." 
Respondents  new  to  a  unit  were  asked  to  estimate  total 
agricultural  sales  in  1 989  even  if  some  portion  of  the  sales 
had  been  made  by  other  occupants  of  the  unit. 

This  item  is  used  mainly  to  classify  housing  units  as  farm 
or  nonfarm  residences,  not  to  provide  detailed  information 
on  the  sale  of  agricultural  products.  Detailed  information 
on  the  sale  of  agricultural  products  is  provided  by  the 
Census  Bureau's  Census  of  Agriculture  (Factfinder  for  the 
Nation:  Agricultural  Statistics,  Bureau  of  the  Census,  1989). 
(For  more  information,  see  the  discussion  under  "Farm 
Residence.") 


BEDROOMS 

The  data  on  bedrooms  were  obtained  from  question- 
naire item  H9,  which  was  asked  at  both  occupied  and 
vacant  housing  units.  This  item  was  asked  on  a  sample 
basis.  The  number  of  bedrooms  is  the  count  of  rooms 
designed  to  be  used  as  bedrooms;  that  is,  the  number  of 
rooms  that  would  be  listed  as  bedrooms  if  the  house  or 
apartment  were  on  the  market  for  sale  or  for  rent.  Included 
are  all  rooms  intended  to  be  used  as  bedrooms  even  if 

B-38 


they  currently  are  being  used  for  some  other  purpose.  A 
housing  unit  consisting  of  only  one  room,  such  as  a 
one-room  efficiency  apartment,  is  classified,  by  definition, 
as  having  no  bedroom. 

Comparability— Data  on  bedrooms  have  been  collected 
in  every  census  since  1960.  In  1970  and  1980,  data  for 
bedrooms  were  shown  only  for  year-round  units.  In  past 
censuses,  a  room  was  defined  as  a  bedroom  if  it  was  used 
mainly  for  sleeping  even  if  also  used  for  other  purposes. 
Rooms  that  were  designed  to  be  used  as  bedrooms  but 
used  mainly  for  other  purposes  were  not  considered  to  be 
bedrooms.  A  distribution  of  housing  units  by  number  of 
bedrooms  calculated  from  data  collected  in  a  1986  test 
showed  virtually  no  differences  in  the  two  versions  except 
in  the  two  bedroom  category,  where  the  previous  "use" 
definition  showed  a  slightly  lower  proportion  of  units. 

BOARDED-UP  STATUS 

Boarded-up  status  was  obtained  from  questionnaire 
item  C2  and  was  determined  for  all  vacant  units.  Boarded-up 
units  have  windows  and  doors  covered  by  wood,  metal,  or 
masonry  to  protect  the  interior  and  to  prevent  entry  into  the 
building.  A  single-unit  structure,  a  unit  in  a  multi-unit 
structure,  or  an  entire  multi-unit  structure  may  be  boarded-up 
in  this  way.  For  certain  census  data  products,  boarded-up 
units  are  shown  only  for  units  in  the  "Other  vacant" 
category.  A  unit  classified  as  "Usual  home  elsewhere"  can 
never  be  boarded  up.  (For  more  information,  see  the 
discussion  under  "Usual  Home  Elsewhere.") 

Comparability— This  item  was  first  asked  in  the  1980 
census  and  was  shown  only  for  year-round  vacant  housing 
units.  In  1990,  data  are  shown  for  all  vacant  housing  units. 

BUSINESS  ON  PROPERTY 

The  data  for  business  on  property  were  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  H5b,  which  was  asked  at  all  occupied 
and  vacant  one-family  houses  and  mobile  homes.  This 
question  is  used  to  exclude  owner-occupied  one-family 
houses  with  business  or  medical  offices  on  the  property 
from  certain  statistics  on  financial  characteristics. 

A  business  must  be  easily  recognizable  from  the  out- 
side. It  usually  will  have  a  separate  outside  entrance  and 
have  the  appearance  of  a  business,  such  as  a  grocery 
store,  restaurant,  or  barber  shop.  It  may  be  either  attached 
to  the  house  or  mobile  home  or  be  located  elsewhere  on 
the  property.  Those  housing  units  in  which  a  room  is  used 
for  business  or  professional  purposes  and  have  no  recog- 
nizable alterations  to  the  outside  are  not  considered  as 
having  a  business.  Medical  offices  are  considered 
businesses  for  tabulation  purposes. 

Comparability — Data  on  business  on  property  have  been 
collected  since  1940. 

DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


CONDOMINIUM  FEE 

The  data  on  condominium  fee  were  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  H25,  which  was  asked  at  owner-occupied 
condominiums.  This  item  was  asked  on  a  sample  basis.  A 
condominium  fee  normally  is  charged  monthly  to  the 
owners  of  the  individual  condominium  units  by  the  condo- 
minium owners  association  to  cover  operating,  mainte- 
nance, administrative,  and  improvement  costs  of  the  com- 
mon property  (grounds,  halls,  lobby,  parking  areas,  laundry 
rooms,  swimming  pool,  etc.)  The  costs  for  utilities  and/or 
fuels  may  be  included  in  the  condominium  fee  if  the  units 
do  not  have  separate  meters. 

Data  on  condominium  fees  may  include  real  estate  tax 
and/or  insurance  payments  for  the  common  property,  but 
do  not  include  real  estate  taxes  or  fire,  hazard,  and  flood 
insurance  for  the  individual  unit  already  reported  in  ques- 
tions H21  and  H22. 

Amounts  reported  were  the  regular  monthly  payment, 
even  if  paid  by  someone  outside  the  household  or  remain 
unpaid.  Costs  were  estimated  as  closely  as  possible  when 
exact  costs  were  not  known. 

The  data  from  this  item  were  added  to  payments  for 
mortgages  (both  first  and  junior  mortgages  and  home 
equity  loans);  real  estate  taxes;  fire,  hazard,  and  flood 
insurance  payments;  and  utilities  and  fuels  to  derive  "Selected 
Monthly  Owner  Costs"  and  "Selected  Monthly  Owner 
Costs  as  a  Percentage  of  Household  Income  in  1989"  for 
condominium  owners. 

Comparability— This  is  a  new  item  in  1990. 

CONDOMINIUM  STATUS 

The  data  on  condominium  housing  units  were  obtained 
from  questionnaire  item  HI 8,  which  was  asked  on  a 
sample  basis  at  both  occupied  and  vacant  housing  units. 
Condominium  is  a  type  of  ownership  that  enables  a  person 
to  own  an  apartment  or  house  in  a  development  of  similarly 
owned  units  and  to  hold  a  common  or  joint  ownership  in 
some  or  all  of  the  common  areas  and  facilities  such  as 
land,  roof,  hallways,  entrances,  elevators,  swimming  pool, 
etc.  Condominiums  may  be  single-family  houses  as  well  as 
units  in  apartment  buildings.  A  condominium  unit  need  not 
be  occupied  by  the  owner  to  be  counted  as  such.  A  unit 
classified  as  "mobile  home  or  trailer"  or  "other"  (see 
discussion  under  "Units  in  Structure")  cannot  be  a  condo- 
minium unit. 

Limitation  of  the  Data— Testing  done  prior  to  the  1 980 
and  1990  censuses  indicated  that  the  number  of  condo- 
miniums may  be  slightly  overstated. 

Comparability — In  1970,  condominiums  were  grouped 
together  with  cooperative  housing  units,  and  the  data  were 
reported  only  for  owner-occupied  cooperatives  and  con- 
dominiums. Beginning  in  1980,  the  census  identified  all 


condominium  units  and  the  data  were  shown  for  renter- 
occupied  and  vacant  year-round  condominiums  as  well  as 
owner  occupied.  In  1970  and  1980,  the  question  on 
condominiums  was  asked  on  a  100-percent  basis.  In  1990, 
it  was  asked  on  a  sample  basis. 

CONTRACT  RENT 

The  data  on  contract  rent  (also  referred  to  as  "rent 
asked"  for  vacant  units)  were  obtained  from  questionnaire 
item  H7a,  which  was  asked  at  all  occupied  housing  units 
that  were  rented  for  cash  rent  and  all  vacant  housing  units 
that  were  for  rent  at  the  time  of  enumeration. 

Housing  units  that  are  renter  occupied  without  payment 
of  cash  rent  are  shown  separately  as  "No  cash  rent"  in 
census  data  products.  The  unit  may  be  owned  by  friends  or 
relatives  who  live  elsewhere  and  who  allow  occupancy 
without  charge.  Rent-free  houses  or  apartments  may  be 
provided  to  compensate  caretakers,  ministers,  tenant  farm- 
ers, sharecroppers,  or  others. 

Contract  rent  is  the  monthly  rent  agreed  to  or  con- 
tracted for,  regardless  of  any  furnishings,  utilities,  fees, 
meals,  or  services  that  may  be  included.  For  vacant  units, 
it  is  the  monthly  rent  asked  for  the  rental  unit  at  the  time  of 
enumeration. 

If  the  contract  rent  includes  rent  for  a  business  unit  or 
for  living  quarters  occupied  by  another  household,  the 
respondent  was  instructed  to  report  that  part  of  the  rent 
estimated  to  be  for  his  or  her  unit  only.  Respondents  were 
asked  to  report  rent  only  for  the  housing  unit  enumerated 
and  to  exclude  any  rent  paid  for  additional  units  or  for 
business  premises. 

If  a  renter  pays  rent  to  the  owner  of  a  condominium  or 
cooperative,  and  the  condominium  fee  or  cooperative 
carrying  charge  is  also  paid  by  the  renter  to  the  owner,  the 
respondent  was  instructed  to  include  the  fee  or  carrying 
charge. 

If  a  renter  receives  payments  from  lodgers  or  roomers 
who  are  listed  as  members  of  the  household,  the  respond- 
ent was  instructed  to  report  the  rent  without  deduction  for 
any  payments  received  from  the  lodgers  or  roomers.  The 
respondent  was  instructed  to  report  the  rent  agreed  to  or 
contracted  for  even  if  paid  by  someone  else  such  as 
friends  or  relatives  living  elsewhere,  or  a  church  or  welfare 
agency. 

In  some  tabulations,  contract  rent  is  presented  for  all 
renter-occupied  housing  units,  as  well  as  specified  renter- 
occupied  and  vacant-for-rent  units.  Specified  renter-occupied 
and  specified  vacant-for-rent  units  exclude  one-family  houses 
on  10  or  more  acres.  (For  more  information  on  rent,  see 
the  discussion  under  "Gross  Rent.") 

Median  and  Quartile  Contract  Rent— The  median  divides 
the  rent  distribution  into  two  equal  parts.  Quartiles  divide 
the  rent  distribution  into  four  equal  parts.  In  computing 
median  and  quartile  contract  rent,  units  reported  as  "No

cash  rent"  are  excluded.  Median  and  quartile  rent  calcu- 
lations are  rounded  to  the  nearest  whole  dollar.  (For  more 
infornnation  on  medians  and  quartiles,  see  the  discussion 
under  "Derived  Measures.") 

Aggregate  Contract  Rent— To  calculate  aggregate  con- 
tract rent,  the  amount  assigned  for  the  category  "Less 
than  $80"  is  $50.  The  amount  assigned  to  the  category 
"$1 ,000  or  more"  is  $1 ,250.  Mean  contract  rent  is  rounded 
to  the  nearest  whole  dollar.  (For  more  information  on 
aggregates  and  means,  see  the  discussion  under  "Derived 
Measures.") 

Limitation  of  the  Data— In  the  1970  and  1980  censuses, 
coa^ract  rent  for  vacant  units  had  high  allocation  rates, 
about  35  percent. 

Comparability— Data  on  this  item  have  been  collected 
since  19^^.  For  1990,  quartiles  were  added  because  the 
range  of  J\ents  and  values  in  the  United  States  has 
increased  in  recent  years.  Upper  and  lower  quartiles  can 
be  used  to  note  large  rent  and  value  differences  among 
various  geographic  areas. 


A  one-family  unit  occupied  by  a  tenant  household 
paying  cash  rent  for  land  and  buildings  is  enumerated  as  a 
farm  residence  only  if  sales  of  agricultural  products  from  its 
yard  (as  opposed  to  the  general  property  on  which  it  is 
located)  amounted  to  at  least  $1 ,000  in  1 989.  A  one-family 
unit  occupied  by  a  tenant  household  that  does  not  pay 
cash  rent  is  enumerated  as  a  farm  residence  if  the 
remainder  of  the  farm  (including  its  yard)  qualifies  as  a 
farm. 

Farm  residence  is  provided  as  an  independent  data  item 
only  for  housing  units  located  in  rural  areas.  It  may  be 
derived  for  housing  units  in  urban  areas  from  the  data 
items  on  acreage  and  sales  of  agricultural  products  on  the 
public-use  microdata  sample  (PUMS)  files.  (For  more 
information  on  PUMS,  see  Appendix  F,  Data  Products  and 
User  Assistance.) 

The  farm  population  consists  of  persons  in  households 
living  in  farm  residences.  Some  persons  who  are  counted 
on  a  property  classified  as  a  farm  (including  in  some  cases 
farm  workers)  are  excluded  from  the  farm  population.  Such 
persons  include  those  who  reside  in  multi-unit  buildings  or 
group  quarters. 


DURATION  OF  VACANCY 

The  data  for  duration  of  vacancy  (also  referred  to  as 
"months  vacant")  were  obtained  from  questionnaire  item 
D,  which  was  completed  by  census  enumerators.  The 
statistics  on  duration  of  vacancy  refer  to  the  length  of  time 
(in  months  and  years)  between  the  date  the  last  occupants 
moved  from  the  unit  and  the  time  of  enumeration.  The 
data,  therefore,  do  not  provide  a  direct  measure  of  the  total 
length  of  time  units  remain  vacant. 

For  newly  constructed  units  which  have  never  been 
occupied,  the  duration  of  vacancy  is  counted  from  the  date 
construction  was  completed.  For  recently  converted  or 
merged  units,  the  time  is  reported  from  the  date  conver- 
sion or  merger  was  completed.  Units  occupied  by  an  entire 
household  with  a  usual  home  elsewhere  are  assigned  to 
the  "Less  than  1  month"  interval. 

Comparability— Similar  data  have  been  collected  since 
1960.  In  1970  and  1980,  these  data  were  shown  only  for 
year-round  vacant  housing  units.  In  1990,  these  data  are 
shown  for  all  vacant  housing  units. 

FARM  RESIDENCE 

The  data  on  farm  residence  were  obtained  from  ques- 
tionnaire items  HI 9a  and  H19b.  An  occupied  one-family 
house  or  mobile  home  is  classified  as  a  farm  residence  if: 
(1)  the  housing  unit  is  located  on  a  property  of  1  acre  or 
more,  and  (2)  at  least  $1 ,000  worth  of  agricultural  products 
were  sold  from  the  property  in  1 989.  Group  quarters  and 
housing  units  that  are  in  multi-unit  buildings  or  vacant  are 
not  included  as  farm  residences. 


Comparability— These  are  the  same  criteria  that  were 
used  to  define  a  farm  residence  in  1 980.  In  1 960  and  1 970, 
a  farm  was  defined  as  a  place  of  1 0  or  more  acres  with  at 
least  $50  worth  of  agricultural  sales  or  a  place  of  less  than 
10  acres  with  at  least  $250  worth  of  agricultural  sales. 
Earlier  censuses  used  other  definitions.  Note  that  the 
definition  of  a  farm  residence  differs  from  the  definition  of 
a  farm  in  the  Census  of  Agriculture  {Factfinder  for  the 
Nation:  Agricultural  Statistics,  Bureau  of  the  Census,  1 989). 


GROSS  RENT 

Gross  rent  is  the  contract  rent  plus  the  estimated 
average  monthly  cost  of  utilities  (electricity,  gas,  and 
water)  and  fuels  (oil,  coal,  kerosene,  wood,  etc.)  if  these 
are  paid  for  by  the  renter  (or  paid  for  the  renter  by 
someone  else).  Gross  rent  is  intended  to  eliminate  differ- 
entials which  result  from  varying  practices  with  respect  to 
the  inclusion  of  utilities  and  fuels  as  part  of  the  rental 
payment.  The  estimated  costs  of  utilities  and  fuels  are 
reported  on  a  yearly  basis  but  are  converted  to  monthly 
figures  for  the  tabulations.  Renter  units  occupied  without 
payment  of  cash  rent  are  shown  separately  as  "No  cash 
rent"  in  the  tabulations.  Gross  rent  is  calculated  on  a 
sample  basis. 

Comparability- Data  on  gross  rent  have  been  collected 
since  1940  for  renter-occupied  housing  units.  In  1980. 
costs  for  electricity  and  gas  were  collected  as  average 
monthly  costs.  In  1990,  all  utility  and  fuel  costs  were 
collected  as  yeady  costs  and  divided  by  12  to  provide  an 
average  monthly  cost.

GROSS  RENT  AS  A  PERCENTAGE  OF 
HOUSEHOLD  INCOME  IN  1989 

Gross  rent  as  a  percentage  of  household  income  in 
1989  is  a  computed  ratio  of  monthly  gross  rent  to  monthly 
household  income  (total  household  income  in  1989  divided 
by  12).  The  ratio  was  computed  separately  for  each  unit 
and  was  rounded  to  the  nearest  whole  percentage.  Units 
for  which  no  cash  rent  is  paid  and  units  occupied  by 
households  that  reported  no  income  or  a  net  loss  in  1989 
comprise  the  category  "Not  computed."  This  item  is 
calculated  on  a  sample  basis. 

HOUSE  HEATING  FUEL 

The  data  on  house  heating  fuel  were  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  HI 4,  which  was  asked  at  occupied 
housing  units.  This  item  was  asked  on  a  sample  basis.  The 
data  show  the  type  of  fuel  used  most  to  heat  the  house  or 
apartment. 

Utility  Gas— Includes  gas  piped  through  underground 
pipes  from  a  central  system  to  serve  the  neighborhood. 

Bottled,  Tanl<,  or  LP  Gas— Includes  liquid  propane  gas 
stored  in  bottles  or  tanks  which  are  refilled  or  exchanged 
when  empty. 

Fuel  Oil,  Kerosene,  Etc.— Includes  fuel  oil,  kerosene, 
gasoline,  alcohol,  and  other  combustible  liquids. 

Wood — Includes  purchased  wood,  wood  cut  by  household 
members  on  their  property  or  elsewhere,  driftwood,  saw- 
mill or  construction  scraps,  or  the  like. 

Solar  Energy— Includes  heat  provided  by  sunlight  which  is 
collected,  stored,  and  actively  distributed  to  most  of  the 
rooms. 

Other  Fuel— Includes  all  other  fuels  not  specified  else- 
where. 

No  Fuel  Used — Includes  units  that  do  not  use  any  fuel  or 
that  do  not  have  heating  equipment. 

Comparability— Data  on  house  heating  fuel  have  been 
collected  since  1940.  The  category,  "Solar  energy"  is  new 
for  1990. 


INSURANCE  FOR  FIRE,  HAZARD,  AND  FLOOD 

The  data  on  fire,  hazard,  and  flood  insurance  were 
obtained  from  questionnaire  item  H22,  which  was  asked  at 
a  sample  of  owner-occupied  one-family  houses,  condomin- 
iums, and  mobile  homes.  The  statistics  for  this  item  refer  to 
the  annual  premium  for  fire,  hazard,  and  flood  insurance  on 


the  property  (land  and  buildings);  that  is,  policies  that 
protect  the  property  and  its  contents  against  loss  due  to 
damage  by  fire,  lightning,  winds,  hail,  flood,  explosion,  and 
so  on. 

Liability  policies  are  included  only  If  they  are  paid  with 
the  fire,  hazard,  and  flood  insurance  premiums  and  the 
amounts  for  fire,  hazard,  and  flood  cannot  be  separated. 
Premiums  are  included  even  if  paid  by  someone  outside 
the  household  or  remain  unpaid.  When  premiums  are  paid 
on  other  than  a  yearly  basis,  the  premiums  are  converted 
to  a  yearly  basis. 

The  payment  for  fire,  hazard,  and  flood  insurance  is 
added  to  payments  for  real  estate  taxes,  utilities,  fuels,  and 
mortgages  (both  first  and  junior  mortgages  and  home 
equity  loans)  to  derive  "Selected  Monthly  Owner  Costs" 
and  "Selected  Monthly  Owner  Costs  as  a  Percentage  of 
Household  Income  in  1989." 

A  separate  question  (H23d)  determines  whether  insur- 
ance premiums  are  included  in  the  mortgage  payment  to 
the  lender(s).  This  makes  it  possible  to  avoid  counting 
these  premiums  twice  in  the  computations. 

Comparability— Data  on  payment  for  fire  and  hazard 
insurance  were  collected  for  the  first  time  in  1980.  Flood 
insurance  was  not  specifically  mentioned  in  the  wording  of 
the  question  in  1980.  The  question  was  asked  only  at 
owner-occupied  one-family  houses.  Excluded  were  mobile 
homes,  condominiums,  houses  with  a  business  or  medical 
office  on  the  property,  houses  on  10  or  more  acres,  and 
housing  units  in  multi-unit  buildings.  In  1990,  the  question 
was  asked  of  all  one-family  owner-occupied  houses,  includ- 
ing houses  on  10  or  more  acres.  It  also  was  asked  at 
mobile  homes,  condominiums,  and  one-family  houses  with 
a  business  or  medical  office  on  the  property. 

KITCHEN  FACILITIES 

Data  on  kitchen  facilities  were  obtained  from  question- 
naire item  H11,  which  was  asked  at  both  occupied  and 
vacant  housing  units.  A  unit  has  complete  kitchen  facilities 
when  it  has  all  of  the  following:  (1)  an  installed  sink  with 
piped  water,  (2)  a  range,  cook  top  and  convection  or 
microwave  oven,  or  cookstove,  and  (3)  a  refrigerator.  All 
kitchen  facilities  must  be  located  in  the  structure.  They 
need  not  be  in  the  same  room.  Portable  cooking  equip- 
ment is  not  considered  a  range  or  cookstove.  An  ice  box  is 
not  considered  to  be  a  refrigerator. 

Comparability— Data  on  complete  kitchen  facilities  were 
collected  for  the  first  time  in  1970.  Earlier  censuses 
collected  data  on  individual  components,  such  as  kitchen 
sink  and  type  of  refrigeration  equipment.  In  1 970  and  1 980, 
data  for  kitchen  facilities  were  shown  only  for  year-round 
units.  In  1990,  data  are  shown  for  all  housing  units, 

MEALS  INCLUDED  IN  RENT 

The  data  on  meals  included  in  the  rent  were  obtained 
from  questionnaire  item  H7b,  which  was  asked  of  all 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


B-41 


occupied  housing  units  that  were  rented  for  cash  and  all 
vacant  housing  units  that  were  for  rent  at  the  time  of 
enumeration. 

The  statistics  on  meals  included  in  rent  are  presented 
for  specified  renter-occupied  and  specified  vacant-for-rent 
units.  Specified  renter-occupied  and  specified  vacant-for- 
rent  units  exclude  one-family  houses  on  10  or  more  acres. 
(For  more  information,  see  the  discussion  under  "Contract 
Rent.") 

Comparability— This  is  a  new  item  in  1 990.  It  is  intended 
to  measure  "congregate"  housing,  which  generally  is 
considered  to  be  housing  units  where  the  rent  includes 
meals  and  other  services,  such  as  transportation  to  shop- 
ping and  recreation. 

MOBILE  HOME  COSTS 

The  data  on  mobile  home  costs  were  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  H26,  which  was  asked  at  owner-occupied 
mobile  homes.  This  item  was  asked  on  a  sample  basis. 

These  data  include  the  total  yearly  costs  for  personal 
property  taxes,  land  or  site  rent,  registration  fees,  and 
license  fees  on  all  owner-occupied  mobile  homes.  The 
instructions  are  to  not  include  real  estate  taxes  already 
reported  in  question  H21. 

Costs  are  estimated  as  closely  as  possible  when  exact 
costs  are  not  known.  Amounts  are  the  total  for  an  entire 
12-month  billing  period,  even  if  they  are  paid  by  someone 
outside  the  household  or  remain  unpaid. 

The  data  from  this  item  are  added  to  payments  for 
mortgages,  real  estate  taxes,  fire,  hazard,  and  flood  insur- 
ance payments,  utilities,  and  fuels  to  derive  selected 
monthly  owner  costs  for  mobile  homes  owners. 

Comparability— This  item  is  new  for  1 990. 

MORTGAGE  PAYMENT 

The  data  on  mortgage  payment  were  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  H23b,  which  was  asked  at  owner 
occupied  one-family  houses,  condominiums,  and  mobile 
homes.  This  item  was  asked  on  a  sample  basis.  Question 
H23b  provides  the  regular  monthly  amount  required  to  be 
paid  the  lender  for  the  first  mortgage  (deed  of  trust, 
contract  to  purchase,  or  similar  debt)  on  the  property. 
Amounts  are  included  even  if  the  payments  are  delinquent 
or  paid  by  someone  else.  The  amounts  reported  are 
included  in  the  computation  of  "Selected  Monthly  Owner 
Costs"  and  "Selected  Monthly  Owner  Costs  as  a  Percent- 
age of  Household  Income  in  1989"  for  units  with  a 
mortgage. 

The  amounts  reported  include  everything  paid  to  the 
lender  including  principal  and  interest  payments,  real  estate 
taxes,  fire,  hazard,  and  flood  insurance  payments,  and 
mortgage  insurance  premiums.  Separate  questions  deter- 
mine whether  real  estate  taxes  and  fire,  hazard,  and  flood 


insurance  payments  are  included  in  the  mortgage  payment 
to  the  lender.  This  makes  it  possible  to  avoid  counting 
these  components  twice  in  the  computation  of  "Selected 
Monthly  Owner  Costs." 

Comparability — Information  on  mortgage  payment  was 
collected  for  the  first  time  in  1980.  It  was  collected  only  at 
owner-occupied  one-family  houses.  Excluded  were  mobile 
homes,  condominiums,  houses  with  a  business  or  medical 
office  on  the  property,  one-family  houses  on  10  or  more 
acres,  and  housing  units  in  multi-unit  buildings.  In  1990,  the 
questions  on  monthly  mortgage  payments  were  asked  of 
all  owner-occupied  one-family  houses,  including  one-family 
houses  on  10  or  more  acres.  They  were  also  asked  at 
mobile  homes,  condominiums,  and  one-family  houses  with 
a  business  or  medical  office. 

The  1980  census  obtained  total  regular  monthly  mort- 
gage payments,  including  payments  on  second  or  junior 
mortgages,  from  a  single  question.  Two  questions  were 
used  in  1990;  one  for  regular  monthly  payments  on  first 
mortgages,  and  one  for  regular  monthly  payments  on 
second  or  junior  mortgages  or  home  equity  loans.  (For 
more  information,  see  the  discussion  under  "Second  or 
Junior  Mortgage  Payment.") 

MORTGAGE  STATUS 

The  data  on  mortgage  status  were  obtained  from  ques- 
tionnaire items  H23a  and  H24a,  which  were  asked  at 
owner-occupied  one-family  houses,  condominiums,  and 
mobile  homes.  "Mortgage"  refers  to  all  forms  of  debt 
where  the  property  is  pledged  as  security  for  repayment  of 
the  debt.  It  includes  such  debt  instruments  as  deeds  of 
trust,  trust  deeds,  contracts  to  purchase,  land  contracts, 
junior  mortgages  and  home  equity  loans. 

A  mortgage  is  considered  a  first  mortgage  if  it  has  prior 
claim  over  any  other  mortgage  or  if  it  is  the  only  mortgage  • 
on  the  property.  All  other  mortgages,  (second,  third,  etc.) 
are  considered  junior  mortgages.  A  home  equity  loan  is 
generally  a  junior  mortgage.  If  no  first  mortgage  is  reported, 
but  a  junior  mortgage  or  home  equity  loan  is  reported,  then 
the  loan  is  considered  a  first  mortgage.  ' 

In  most  census  data  products,  the  tabulations  for  "Selected 
Monthly  Owner  Costs"  and  "Selected  Monthly  Owner 
Costs  as  a  Percentage  of  Household  Income  in  1989"  , 
usually  are  shown  separately  for  units  "with  a  mortgage" 
and  for  units  "not  mortgaged."  The  category  "not  mort-  , 
gaged"  is  comprised  of  housing  units  owned  free  and  clear 
of  debt. 


Comparability — A  question  on  mortgage  status  was  included 
in  the  1940  and  1950  censuses,  but  not  in  the  1960  and 
1970  censuses.  The  item  was  reinstated  in  1980  along 
with  a  separate  question  dealing  with  the  existence  of 
second  or  junior  mortgages.  In  1980,  the  mortgage  status 
questions  were  asked  at  owner-occupied  one-family  houses  > 
on  less  than  10  acres.  Excluded  were  mobile  homes.

DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


condominiums,  houses  with  a  business  or  medical  office, 
houses  on  10  or  more  acres,  and  housing  units  in  multi-unit 
buildings.  In  1990,  the  questions  were  asked  of  all  one- 
family  owner-occupied  housing  units,  including  houses  on 
10  or  more  acres.  They  were  also  asked  at  mobile  homes, 
condominiums,  and  houses  with  a  business  or  medical 
office. 

PERSONS  IN  UNIT 

This  item  is  based  on  the  100-percent  count  of  persons 
in  occupied  housing  units.  All  persons  occupying  the 
housing  unit  are  counted,  including  the  householder,  occu- 
pants related  to  the  householder,  and  lodgers,  roomers, 
boarders,  and  so  forth. 

The  data  on  "persons  in  unit"  show  the  number  of 
housing  units  occupied  by  the  specified  number  of  per- 
sons. The  phrase  "persons  in  unit"  is  used  for  housing 
tabulations,  "persons  in  households"  for  population  items. 
Figures  for  "persons  in  unit"  match  those  for  "persons  in 
household"  for  100-percent  data  products.  In  sample 
products,  they  may  differ  because  of  the  weighting 
process. 

Median  Persons  in  Unit— In  computing  median  persons 
in  unit,  a  whole  number  is  used  as  the  midpoint  of  an 
interval;  thus,  a  unit  with  4  persons  is  treated  as  an  interval 
ranging  from  3.5  to  4.5  persons.  Median  persons  is  rounded 
to  the  nearest  hundredth.  (For  more  information  on  medi- 
ans, see  the  discussion  under  "Derived  Measures.") 

Persons  in  Occupied  Housing  Units— This  is  the  total 
population  minus  those  persons  living  in  group  quarters. 
"Persons  per  occupied  housing  unit"  is  computed  by 
dividing  the  population  living  in  housing  units  by  the 
number  of  occupied  housing  units. 

PERSONS  PER  ROOM 

"Persons  per  room"  is  obtained  by  dividing  the  number 
of  persons  in  each  occupied  housing  unit  by  the  number  of 
rooms  in  the  unit.  Persons  per  room  is  rounded  to  the 
nearest  hundredth.  The  figures  shown  refer,  therefore,  to 
the  number  of  occupied  housing  units  having  the  specified 
ratio  of  persons  per  room. 

Mean  Persons  Per  Room— This  is  computed  by  dividing 
persons  in  housing  units  by  the  aggregate  number  of 
rooms.  This  is  intended  to  provide  a  measure  of  utilization. 
A  higher  mean  may  indicate  a  greater  degree  of  utilization 
or  crowding;  a  low  mean  may  indicate  under-utilization. 
(For  more  information  on  means,  see  the  discussion  under 
"Derived  Measures.") 

PLUMBING  FACILITIES 

The  data  on  plumbing  facilities  were  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  H10,  which  was  asked  at  both  occupied 
and  vacant  housing  units.  This  item  was  asked  on  a 


sample  basis.  Complete  plumbing  facilities  include  hot  and 
cold  piped  water,  a  flush  toilet,  and  a  bathtub  or  shower.  All 
three  facilities  must  be  located  inside  the  house,  apart- 
ment, or  mobile  home,  but  not  necessarily  in  the  same 
room.  Housing  units  are  classified  as  lacking  complete 
plumbing  facilities  when  any  of  the  three  facilities  are  not 
present. 

Comparability— The  1990  data  on  complete  plumbing 
facilities  are  not  strictly  comparable  with  the  1980  data.  In 
1980,  complete  plumbing  facilities  were  defined  as  hot  and 
cold  piped  water,  a  bathtub  or  shower,  and  a  flush  toilet  in 
the  housing  unit  for  the  exclusive  use  of  the  residents  of 
that  unit.  In  1990,  the  Census  Bureau  dropped  the  require- 
ment of  exclusive  use  from  the  definition  of  complete 
plumbing  facilities.  Of  the  2.3  million  year-round  housing 
units  classified  in  1980  as  lacking  complete  plumbing  for 
exclusive  use,  approximately  25  percent  of  these  units  had 
complete  plumbing  but  the  facilities  were  also  used  by 
members  of  another  household.  From  1940  to  1970, 
separate  and  more  detailed  questions  were  asked  on 
piped  water,  bathing,  and  toilet  facilities.  In  1970  and  1980, 
the  data  on  plumbing  facilities  were  shown  only  for  year- 
round  units. 

POVERTY  STATUS  OF  HOUSEHOLDS  IN  1989 

The  data  on  poverty  status  of  households  were  derived 
from  answers  to  the  income  questions.  The  income  items 
were  asked  on  a  sample  basis.  Households  are  classified 
below  the  poverty  level  when  the  total  1 989  income  of  the 
family  or  of  the  nonfamily  householder  is  below  the  appro- 
priate poverty  threshold.  The  income  of  persons  living  in 
the  household  who  are  unrelated  to  the  householder  is  not 
considered  when  determining  the  poverty  status  of  a 
household,  nor  does  their  presence  affect  the  household 
size  in  determining  the  appropriate  poverty  threshold.  The 
poverty  thresholds  vary  depending  upon  three  criteria:  size 
of  family,  number  of  children,  and  age  of  the  family 
householder  or  unrelated  individual  for  one  and  two- 
persons  households.  (For  more  information,  see  the  dis- 
cussion of  "Poverty  Status  in  1989"  and  "Income  in  1989" 
under  Population  Characteristics.) 

REAL  ESTATE  TAXES 

The  data  on  real  estate  taxes  were  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  H21 ,  which  was  asked  at  owner-occupied 
one-family  houses,  condominiums,  and  mobile  homes.  The 
statistics  from  this  question  refer  to  the  total  amount  of  all 
real  estate  taxes  on  the  entire  property  (land  and  buildings) 
payable  in  1989  to  all' taxing  jurisdictions,  including  special 
assessments,  school  taxes,  county  taxes,  and  so  forth. 

Real  estate  taxes  include  State,  local,  and  all  other  real 
estate  taxes  even  if  delinquent,  unpaid,  or  paid  by  some- 
one who  is  not  a  member  of  the  household.  However, 
taxes  due  from  prior  years  are  not  included.  If  taxes  are 
paid  on  other  than  a  yearly  basis,  the  payments  are 
converted  to  a  yearly  basis.

B-43 


The  payment  for  real  estate  taxes  is  added  to  payments 
for  fire,  hazard,  and  flood  insurance;  utilities  and  fuels;  and 
mortgages  (both  first  and  junior  mortgages  and  home 
equity  loans)  to  derive  "Selected  Monthly  Owner  Costs" 
and  "Selected  Monthly  Owner  Costs  as  a  Percentage  of 
Household  Income  in  1989."  A  separate  question  (H23c) 
determines  whether  real  estate  taxes  are  included  in  the 
mortgage  payment  to  the  lender(s).  This  makes  it  possible 
to  avoid  counting  taxes  twice  in  the  computations. 

Comparability — Data  for  real  estate  taxes  were  collected 
for  the  first  time  in  1980.  The  question  was  asked  only  at 
owner-occupied  one-family  houses.  Excluded  were  mobile 
homes  or  trailers,  condominiums,  houses  with  a  business 
or  medical  office  on  the  property,  houses  on  10  or  more 
acres,  and  housing  units  in  multi-unit  buildings.  In  1990,  the 
question  was  asked  of  all  one-family  owner-occupied 
houses,  including  houses  on  10  or  more  acres.  It  also  was 
asked  at  mobile  homes,  condominiums,  and  one-family 
houses  with  a  business  or  medical  office  on  the  property. 

ROOMS 

The  data  on  rooms  were  obtained  from  questionnaire 
item  H3,  which  was  asked  at  both  occupied  and  vacant 
housing  units.  The  statistics  on  rooms  are  in  terms  of  the 
number  of  housing  units  with  a  specified  number  of  rooms. 
The  intent  of  this  question  is  to  count  the  number  of  whole 
rooms  used  for  living  purposes. 

For  each  unit,  rooms  include  living  rooms,  dining  rooms, 
kitchens,  bedrooms,  finished  recreation  rooms,  enclosed 
porches  suitable  for  year-round  use,  and  lodger's  rooms. 
Excluded  are  strip  or  pullman  kitchens,  bathrooms,  open 
porches,  balconies,  halls  or  foyers,  half-rooms,  utility  rooms, 
unfinished  attics  or  basements,  or  other  unfinished  space 
used  for  storage.  A  partially  divided  room  is  a  separate 
room  only  if  there  is  a  partition  from  floor  to  ceiling,  but  not 
if  the  partition  consists  solely  of  shelves  or  cabinets. 

Median  Rooms— This  measure  divides  the  room  distribu- 
tion into  two  equal  parts,  one-half  of  the  cases  falling 
below  the  median  number  of  rooms  and  one-half  above 
the  median.  In  computing  median  rooms,  the  whole  num- 
ber is  used  as  the  midpoint  of  the  interval;  thus,  the 
category  "3  rooms"  is  treated  as  an  interval  ranging  from 
2.5  to  3.5  rooms.  Median  rooms  is  rounded  to  the  nearest 
tenth.  (For  more  information  on  medians,  see  the  discus- 
sion under  "Derived  Measures.") 

Aggregate  Rooms— To  calculate  aggregate  rooms,  an 
arbitrary  value  of  "10"  is  assigned  to  rooms  for  units  falling 
within  the  terminal  category,  "9  or  more."  (For  more 
information  on  aggregates  and  means,  see  the  discussion 
under  "Derived  Measures.") 

Comparability— Data  on  rooms  have  been  collected  since 
1940.  In  1970  and  1980,  these  data  were  shown  only  for 
year-round  housing  units.  In  1990,  these  data  are  shown 
for  all  housing  units. 


SECOND  OR  JUNIOR  MORTGAGE  PAYMENT 

The  data  on  second  or  junior  mortgage  payments  were 
obtained  from  questionnaire  items  H24a  and  H24b,  which 
were  asked  at  owner-occupied  one-family  houses,  condo- 
miniums, and  mobile  homes.  Ouestion  H24a  asks  whether 
a  second  or  junior  mortgage  or  a  home  equity  loan  exists 
on  the  property.  Question  H24b  provides  the  regular 
monthly  amount  required  to  be  paid  to  the  lender  on  all 
second  or  junior  mortgages  and  home  equity  loans.  Amounts 
are  included  even  if  the  payments  are  delinquent  or  paid  by 
someone  else.  The  amounts  reported  are  included  in  the 
computation  of  "Selected  Monthly  Owner  Costs"  and 
"Selected  Monthly  Owner  Costs  as  a  Percentage  of  House- 
hold Income  in  1989"  for  units  with  a  mortgage. 

All  mortgages  other  than  first  mortgages  are  classified 
as  "junior"  mortgages.  A  second  mortgage  is  a  junior 
mortgage  that  gives  the  lender  a  claim  against  the  property 
that  is  second  to  the  claim  of  the  holder  of  the  first 
mortgage.  Any  other  junior  mortgage(s)  would  be  subordi- 
nate to  the  second  mortgage.  A  home  equity  loan  is  a  line 
of  credit  available  to  the  borrower  that  is  secured  by  real 
estate.  It  may  be  placed  on  a  property  that  already  has  a 
first  or  second  mortgage,  or  it  may  be  placed  on  a  property 
that  is  owned  free  and  clear. 

If  the  respondents  answered  that  no  first  mortgage 
existed,  but  a  second  mortgage  did  (as  in  the  above  case 
with  a  home  equity  loan),  a  computer  edit  assigned  the  unit 
a  first  mortgage  and  made  the  first  mortgage  monthly 
payment  the  amount  reported  in  the  second  mortgage. 
The  second  mortgage  data  were  then  made  "No"  in 
question  H24a  and  blank  in  question  H24b. 

Comparability— The  1980  census  obtained  total  regular 
monthly  mortgage  payments,  including  payments  on  sec- 
ond or  junior  mortgages,  from  one  single  question.  Two 
questions  were  used  in  1990:  one  for  regular  monthly 
payments  on  first  mortgages,  and  one  for  regular  monthly 
payments  on  second  or  junior  mortgages  and  home  equity 
loans. 


SELECTED  MONTHLY  OWNER  COSTS 

The  data  on  selected  monthly  owner  costs  were  obtained 
from  questionnaire  items  H20  through  H26  for  a  sample  of 
owner-occupied  one-family  houses,  condominiums,  and 
mobile  homes.  Selected  monthly  owner  costs  is  the  sum  of 
payments  for  mortgages,  deeds  of  trust,  contracts  to 
purchase,  or  similar  debts  on  the  property  (including 
payments  for  the  first  mortgage,  second  or  junior  mort- 
gages, and  home  equity  loans);  real  estate  taxes;  fire, 
hazard,  and  flood  insurance  on  the  property;  utilities  (elec- 
tricity, gas,  and  water);  and  fuels  (oil,  coal,  kerosene,  wood, 
etc.).  It  also  includes,  where  appropriate,  the  monthly 
condominium  fee  for  condominiums  and  mobile  home 
costs  (personal  property  taxes,  site  rent,  registration  fees, 
and  license  fees)  for  mobile  homes. 


B-44 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


In  certain  tabulations,  selected  monthly  owner  costs  are 
presented  separately  for  specified  owner-occupied  hous- 
ing units  (owner-occupied  one-family  houses  on  fewer 
than  10  acres  without  a  business  or  medical  office  on  the 
property),  owner-occupied  condominiums,  and  owner-occupied 
mobile  homes.  Data  usually  are  shown  separately  for  units 
"with  a  mortgage"  and  for  units  "not  mortgaged." 


of  sewage  by  other  means.  A  public  sewer  may  be 
operated  by  a  government  body  or  by  a  private  organiza- 
tion. A  housing  unit  is  considered  to  be  connected  to  a 
septic  tank  or  cesspool  when  the  unit  is  provided  with  an 
underground  pit  or  tank  for  sewage  disposal.  The  category, 
"Other  means"  includes  housing  units  which  dispose  of 
sewage  in  some  other  way. 


Median  Selected  Monthly  Owner  Costs— This  measure 
is  rounded  to  the  nearest  whole  dollar. 

Comparability— The  components  of  selected  monthly  owner 
costs  were  collected  for  the  first  time  in  1980.  The  1990 
tabulations  of  selected  monthly  owner  costs  for  specified 
owner-occupied  housing  units  are  virtually  identical  to 
1980,  the  primary  difference  was  the  amounts  of  the  first 
and  second  mortgages  were  collected  in  separate  ques- 
tions in  1990,  while  the  amounts  were  collected  in  a  single 
question  in  1980.  The  component  parts  of  the  item  were 
tabulated  for  mobile  homes  and  condominiums  for  the  first 
time  in  1990. 

In  1980,  costs  for  electricity  and  gas  were  collected  as 
average  monthly  costs.  In  1990,  all  utility  and  fuel  costs 
were  collected  as  yearly  costs  and  divided  by  12  to  provide 
an  average  monthly  cost. 

SELECTED  MONTHLY  OWNER  COSTS  AS  A 
PERCENTAGE  OF  HOUSEHOLD  INCOME  IN 
1989 

The  information  on  selected  monthly  owner  costs  as  a 
percentage  of  household  income  in  1989  is  the  computed 
ratio  of  selected  monthly  owner  costs  to  monthly  house- 
hold income  in  1 989.  The  ratio  was  computed  separately 
for  each  unit  and  rounded  to  the  nearest  whole  percent- 
age. The  data  are  tabulated  separately  for  specified  owner- 
occupied  units,  condominiums,  and  mobile  homes. 

Separate  distributions  are  often  shown  for  units  "with  a 
mortgage"  and  for  units  "not  mortgaged."  Units  occupied 
by  households  reporting  no  income  or  a  net  loss  in  1989 
are  included  in  the  "not  computed"  category.  (For  more 
information,  see  the  discussion  under  "Selected  Monthly 
Owner  Costs.") 

Comparability— The  components  of  selected  monthly  owner 
costs  were  collected  for  the  first  time  in  1 980.  The  tabula- 
tions of  "Selected  Monthly  Owner  Costs  as  a  Percentage 
of  Household  Income  in  1989"  for  specified  owner-occupied 
housing  units  are  comparable  to  1 980. 


Comparability— Data  on  sewage  disposal  have  been  col- 
lected since  1940.  In  1970  and  1980,  data  were  shown 
only  for  year-round  housing  units.  In  1990,  data  are  shown 
for  all  housing  units. 

SOURCE  OF  WATER 

The  data  on  source  of  water  were  obtained  from  ques- 
tionnaire item  HI  5,  which  was  asked  at  both  occupied  and 
vacant  housing  units.  Housing  units  may  receive  their 
water  supply  from  a  number  of  sources.  A  common  source 
supplying  water  to  five  or  more  units  is  classified  as  a 
"Public  system  or  private  company."  The  water  may  be 
supplied  by  a  city,  county,  water  district,  water  company, 
etc.,  or  it  may  be  obtained  from  a  well  which  supplies  water 
to  five  or  more  housing  units.  If  the  water  is  supplied  from 
a  well  serving  four  or  fewer  housing  units,  the  units  are 
classified  as  having  water  supplied  by  either  an  "Individual 
drilled  well"  or  an  "Individual  dug  well."  Drilled  wells  or 
small  diameter  wells  are  usually  less  than  1-1/2  feet  in 
diameter.  Dug  wells  are  usually  larger  than  1-1  /2  feet  wide 
and  generally  hand  dug.  The  category,  "Some  other 
source"  includes  water  obtained  from  springs,  creeks, 
rivers,  lakes,  cisterns,  etc. 

Comparability— Data  on  source  of  water  have  been  col- 
lected since  1940.  In  1970  and  1980,  data  were  shown 
only  for  year-round  housing  units.  In  1990,  data  are  shown 
for  all  housing  units. 

TELEPHONE  IN  HOUSING  UNIT 

The  data  on  telephones  were  obtained  from  question- 
naire item  HI  2,  which  was  asked  at  occupied  housing 
units.  This  item  was  asked  on  a  sample  basis.  A  telephone 
must  be  inside  the  house  or  apartment  for  the  unit  to  be 
classified  as  having  a  telephone.  Units  where  the  respond- 
ent uses  a  telephone  located  inside  the  building  but  not  in 
the  respondent's  living  quarters  are  classified  as  having  no 
telephone. 


SEWAGE  DISPOSAL 

The  data  on  sewage  disposal  were  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  HI  6,  which  was  asked  at  both  occupied 
and  vacant  housing  units.  This  item  was  asked  on  a 
sample  basis.  Housing  units  are  either  connected  to  a 
public  sewer,  to  a  septic  tank  or  cesspool,  or  they  dispose 


Comparability— Data  on  telephones  in  1980  are  compa- 
rable to  1 990.  The  1 960  and  1 970  censuses  collected  data 
on  telephone  availability.  A  unit  was  classified  as  having  a 
telephone  available  if  there  was  a  telephone  number  on 
which  occupants  of  the  unit  could  be  reached.  The  tele- 
phone could  have  been  in  another  unit,  in  a  common  hall, 
or  outside  the  building.

TENURE 

The  data  for  tenure  were  obtained  from  questionnaire 
item  H4,  which  was  asked  at  ail  occupied  housing  units.  All 
occupied  housing  units  are  classified  as  either  owner 
occupied  or  renter  occupied. 

Owner  Occupied — A  housing  unit  is  owner  occupied  if  the 
owner  or  co-owner  lives  in  the  unit  even  if  it  is  mortgaged 
or  not  fully  paid  for.  The  owner  or  co-owner  must  live  in  the 
unit  and  usually  is  the  person  listed  in  column  1  of  the 
questionnaire.  The  unit  is  "Owned  by  you  or  someone  in 
this  household  with  a  mortgage  or  loan"  if  it  is  being 
purchased  with  a  mortgage  or  some  other  debt  arrange- 
ment such  as  a  deed  of  trust,  trust  deed,  contract  to 
purchase,  land  contract,  or  purchase  agreement.  The  unit 
is  also  considered  owned  with  a  mortgage  if  it  is  built  on 
leased  land  and  there  is  a  mortgage  on  the  unit. 

A  housing  unit  is  "Owned  by  you  or  someone  in  this 
household  free  and  clear  (without  a  mortgage)"  if  there  is 
no  mortgage  or  other  similar  debt  on  the  house,  apartment, 
or  mobile  home  including  units  built  on  leased  land  if  the 
unit  is  owned  outright  without  a  mortgage.  Although  owner- 
occupied  units  are  divided  between  mortgaged  and  owned 
free  and  clear  on  the  questionnaire,  census  data  products 
containing  1 00-percent  data  show  only  total  owner-occupied 
counts.  More  extensive  mortgage  information  was  col- 
lected on  the  long-form  questionnaire  and  are  shown  in 
census  products  containing  sample  data.  (For  more  infor- 
mation, see  the  discussion  under  "Mortgage  Status.") 

Renter  Occupied— All  occupied  housing  units  which  are 
not  owner  occupied,  whether  they  are  rented  for  cash  rent 
or  occupied  without  payment  of  cash  rent,  are  classified  as 
renter  occupied.  "No  cash  rent"  units  are  separately 
identified  in  the  rent  tabulations.  Such  units  are  generally 
provided  free  by  friends  or  relatives  or  in  exchange  for 
services  such  as  resident  manager,  caretaker,  minister,  or 
tenant  farmer.  Housing  units  on  military  bases  also  are 
classified  in  the  "No  cash  rent"  category.  "Rented  for  cash 
rent"  includes  units  in  continuing  care,  sometimes  called 
life  care  arrangements.  These  arrangements  usually  involve 
a  contract  between  one  or  more  individuals  and  a  health 
services  provider  guaranteeing  the  individual  shelter,  usu- 
ally a  house  or  apartment,  and  services,  such  as  meals  or 
transportation  to  shopping  or  recreation. 

Comparability— Data  on  tenure  have  been  collected  since 
1890.  In  1970,  the  question  on  tenure  also  included  a 
category  for  condominium  and  cooperative  ownership.  In 
1980,  condominium  units  and  cooperatives  were  dropped 
from  the  tenure  item,  and  since  1980,  only  condominium 
units  are  identified  in  a  separate  question. 

For  1990,  the  response  categories  were  expanded  to 
allow  the  respondent  to  report  whether  the  unit  was  owned 
with  a  mortgage  or  free  and  clear  (without  a  mortgage). 
The  distinction  between  units  owned  with  a  mortgage  and 
units  owned  free  and  clear  was  added  in  1990  to  improve 


the  count  of  owner-occupied  units.  Research  after  the 
1980  census  indicated  some  respondents  did  not  consider 
their  units  owned  if  they  had  a  mortgage. 

UNITS  IN  STRUCTURE 

The  data  on  units  in  structure  (also  referred  to  as  "type 
of  structure")  were  obtained  from  questionnaire  item  H2, 
which  was  asked  at  all  housing  units.  A  structure  is  a 
separate  building  that  either  has  open  spaces  on  all  sides 
or  is  separated  from  other  structures  by  dividing  walls  that 
extend  from  ground  to  roof.  In  determining  the  number  of 
units  in  a  structure,  all  housing  units,  both  occupied  and 
vacant,  are  counted.  Stores  and  office  space  are  excluded. 

The  statistics  are  presented  for  the  number  of  housing 
units  in  structures  of  specified  type  and  size,  not  for  the 
number  of  residential  buildings. 

1-Unit,  Detached — This  is  a  1-unlt  structure  detached 
from  any  other  house;  that  is,  with  open  space  on  all  four 
sides.  Such  structures  are  considered  detached  even  if 
they  have  an  adjoining  shed  or  garage.  A  one-family  house 
that  contains  a  business  is  considered  detached  as  long  as 
the  building  has  open  space  on  all  four  sides.  Mobile 
homes  or  trailers  to  which  one  or  more  permanent  rooms 
have  been  added  or  built  also  are  included. 

1-Unit,  Attached— This  is  a  1-unit  structure  that  has  one 
or  more  walls  extending  from  ground  to  roof  separating  it 
from  adjoining  structures.  In  row  houses  (sometimes  called 
townhouses),  double  houses,  or  houses  attached  to  non- 
residential structures,  each  house  is  a  separate,  attached 
structure  if  the  dividing  or  common  wall  goes  from  ground 
to  roof. 

2  or  More  Units — These  are  units  in  structures  containing 
2  or  more  housing  units,  further  categorized  as  units  in 
structures  with  2,  3  or  4,  5  to  9,  10  to  19,  20  to  49,  and  50 
or  more  units. 

Mobile  Home  or  Trailer— Both  occupied  and  vacant 
mobile  homes  to  which  no  permanent  rooms  have  been 
added  are  counted  in  this  category.  Mobile  homes  or 
trailers  used  only  for  business  purposes  or  for  extra 
sleeping  space  and  mobile  homes  or  trailers  for  sale  on  a 
dealer's  lot,  at  the  factory,  or  in  storage  are  not  counted  in 
the  housing  inventory. 

Other — This  category  is  for  any  living  quarters  occupied  as 
a  housing  unit  that  does  not  fit  the  previous  categories. 
Examples  that  fit  this  category  are  houseboats,  railroad 
cars,  campers,  and  vans. 

Comparability — Data  on  units  in  structure  have  been 
collected  since  1940  and  on  mobile  homes  and  trailers 
since  1 950.  In  1 970  and  1 980,  these  data  were  shown  only 
for  year-round  housing  units.   In   1990.  these  data  are 


B-46 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


shown  for  all  housing  units.  In  1980,  the  data  were 
collected  on  a  sample  basis.  The  category,  "Boat,  tent, 
van,  etc."  was  replaced  in  1990  by  the  category  "Other." 
In  some  areas,  the  proportion  of  units  classified  as  "Other" 
is  far  larger  than  the  number  of  units  that  were  classified  as 
"Boat,  tent,  van,  etc."  in  1980. 


USUAL  HOME  ELSEWHERE 

The  data  for  usual  home  elsewhere  are  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  B,  which  was  completed  by  census 
employees.  A  housing  unit  temporarily  occupied  at  the 
time  of  enumeration  entirely  by  persons  with  a  usual 
residence  elsewhere  is  classified  as  vacant.  The  occu- 
pants are  classified  as  having  a  "Usual  home  elsewhere" 
and  are  counted  at  the  address  of  their  usual  place  of 
residence.  Typical  examples  are  people  in  a  vacation 
home,  persons  renting  living  quarters  temporarily  for  work, 
and  migrant  workers. 

Limitation  of  the  Data — Evidence  from  previous  cen- 
suses suggests  that  in  some  areas  enumerators  marked 
units  as  "vacant— usual  home  elsewhere"  when  they 
should  have  marked  "vacant— regular." 

Comparability— Data  for  usual  home  elsewhere  was  tab- 
ulated for  the  first  time  in  1 980. 


UTILITIES 

The  data  on  utility  costs  were  obtained  from  question- 
naire items  H20a  through  H20d,  which  were  asked  of 
occupied  housing  units.  These  items  were  asked  on  a 
sample  basis. 

Questions  H20a  through  H20d  asked  for  the  yearly  cost 
of  utilities  (electricity,  gas,  water)  and  other  fuels  (oil,  coal, 
wood,  kerosene,  etc.).  For  the  tabulations,  these  yearly 
amounts  are  divided  by  12  to  derive  the  average  monthly 
cost  and  are  then  included  in  the  computation  of  "Gross 
Rent,"  "Gross  Rent  as  a  Percentage  of  Household  Income 
in  1 989,"  "Selected  Monthly  Owner  Costs,"  and  "Selected 
Monthly  Owner  Costs  as  a  Percentage  of  Household 
Income  in  1989." 

Costs  are  recorded  if  paid  by  or  billed  to  occupants,  a 
welfare  agency,  relatives,  or  friends.  Costs  that  are  paid  by 
landlords,  included  in  the  rent  payment,  or  included  in 
condominium  or  cooperative  fees  are  excluded. 

Limitation  of  the  Data — Research  has  shown  that  respon- 
dents tended  to  overstate  their  expenses  for  electricity  and 
gas  when  compared  to  utility  company  records.  There  is 
some  evidence  that  this  overstatement  is  reduced  when 
yearly  costs  are  asked  rather  than  monthly  costs.  Caution 
should  be  exercised  in  using  these  data  for  direct  analysis 
because  costs  are  not  reported  for  certain  kinds  of  units 


such  as  renter-occupied  units  with  all  utilities  included  in 
the  rent  and  owner-occupied  condominium  units  with 
utilities  included  in  the  condominium  fee. 

Comparability— The  data  on  utility  costs  have  been  col- 
lected since  1980  for  owner-occupied  housing  units,  and 
since  1940  for  renter-occupied  housing  units.  In  1980, 
costs  for  electricity  and  gas  were  collected  as  average 
monthly  costs.  In  1990,  all  utility  and  fuel  costs  were 
collected  as  yearly  costs  and  divided  by  1 2  to  provide  an 
average  monthly  cost. 

VACANCY  STATUS 

The  data  on  vacancy  status  were  obtained  from  ques- 
tionnaire item  CI,  which  was  completed  by  census  enu- 
merators. Vacancy  status  and  other  characteristics  of 
vacant  units  were  determined  by  enumerators  obtaining 
information  from  landlords,  owners,  neighbors,  rental  agents, 
and  others.  Vacant  units  are  subdivided  according  to  their 
housing  market  classification  as  follows: 

For  Rent— These  are  vacant  units  offered  "for  rent,"  and 
vacant  units  offered  either  "for  rent"  or  "for  sale." 

For  Sale  Only—lhese  are  vacant  units  being  offered  "for 
sale  only,"  including  units  in  cooperatives  and  condomin- 
ium projects  if  the  individual  units  are  offered  "for  sale 
only." 

Rented  or  Sold,  Not  Occupied— \i  any  money  rent  has 
been  paid  or  agreed  upon  but  the  new  renter  has  not 
moved  in  as  of  the  date  of  enumeration,  or  if  the  unit  has 
recently  been  sold  but  the  new  owner  has  not  yet  moved 
in,  the  vacant  unit  is  classified  as  "rented  or  sold,  not 
occupied." 

For  Seasonal,  Recreational,  or  Occasional  6/se— These 
are  vacant  units  used  or  intended  for  use  only  in  certain 
seasons  or  for  weekend  or  other  occasional  use  through- 
out the  year. 

Seasonal  units  include  those  used  for  summer  or  winter 
sports  or  recreation,  such  as  beach  cottages  and  hunting 
cabins.  Seasonal  units  also  may  include  quarters  for  such 
workers  as  herders  and  loggers.  Interval  ownership  units, 
sometimes  called  shared-ownership  or  time-sharing  con- 
dominiums, also  are  included  here. 

For  Migrant  Workers— These  include  vacant  units  intended 
for  occupancy  by  migratory  workers  employed  in  farm  work 
during  the  crop  season.  (Work  in  a  cannery,  a  freezer  plant, 
or  a  food-processing  plant  is  not  farm  work.) 

Other  Vacant— \i  a  vacant  unit  does  not  fall  into  any  of  the 
classifications  specified  above,  it  is  classified  as  "other 
vacant."  For  example,  this  category  includes  units  held  for 
occupancy  by  a  caretaker  or  janitor,  and  units  held  for 
personal  reasons  of  the  owner.

B-47 


Homeowner  Vacancy  Rate— This  is  the  percentage  rela- 
tionship between  the  number  of  vacant  units  for  sale  and 
the  total  homeowner  inventory.  It  is  computed  by  dividing 
the  number  of  vacant  units  for  sale  only  by  the  sum  of  the 
owner-occupied  units  and  the  number  of  vacant  units  that 
are  for  sale  only. 

Rental  Vacancy  Rate— This  is  the  percentage  relation- 
ship of  the  number  of  vacant  units  for  rent  to  the  total 
rental  inventory.  It  is  computed  by  dividing  the  number  of 
vacant  units  for  rent  by  the  sum  of  the  renter-occupied 
units  and  the  number  of  vacant  units  for  rent. 

Comparability— Data  on  vacancy  status  have  been  col- 
lected since  1940.  For  1990,  the  category,  "seasonal/rec- 
reational/occasional use"  combined  vacant  units  classi- 
fied in  1980  as  "seasonal  or  migratory"  and  "held  for 
occasional  use."  Also,  in  1970  and  1980,  housing  charac- 
teristics generally  were  presented  only  for  year-round 
units.  In  1990,  housing  characteristics  are  shown  for  all 
housing  units. 

VALUE 

The  data  on  value  (also  referred  to  as  "price  asked"  for 
vacant  units)  were  obtained  from  questionnaire  item  H6, 
which  was  asked  at  housing  units  that  were  owned,  being 
bought,  or  vacant  for  sale  at  the  time  of  enumeration. 
Value  is  the  respondent's  estimate  of  how  much  the 
property  (house  and  lot,  mobile  home  and  lot,  or  condo- 
minium unit)  would  sell  for  if  it  were  for  sale.  If  the  house  or 
mobile  home  was  owned  or  being  bought,  but  the  land  on 
which  it  sits  was  not,  the  respondent  was  asked  to 
estimate  the  combined  value  of  the  house  or  mobile  home 
and  the  land.  For  vacant  units,  value  was  the  price  asked 
for  the  property. 

Value  was  tabulated  separately  for  all  owner-occupied 
and  vacant-for-sale  housing  units,  owner-occupied  and 
vacant-for-sale  mobile  homes  or  trailers,  and  specified 
owner-occupied  and  specified  vacant-for-sale  housing  units. 
Specified  owner-occupied  and  specified  vacant-for-sale 
housing  units  include  only  one-family  houses  on  fewer  than 
10  acres  without  a  business  or  medical  office  on  the 
property.  The  data  for  "specified  units"  exclude  mobile 
homes,  houses  with  a  business  or  medical  office,  houses 
on  10  or  more  acres,  and  housing  units  in  multi-unit 
buildings. 

Median  and  Quartile  Value— The  median  divides  the 
value  distribution  into  two  equal  parts.  Quartiles  divide  the 
value  distribution  into  four  equal  parts.  These  measures 
are  rounded  to  the  nearest  hundred  dollars.  (For  more 
information  on  medians  and  quartiles,  see  the  discussion 
under  "Derived  Measures.") 

Aggregate  Value— To  calculate  aggregate  value,  the  amount 
assigned  for  the  category  "Less  than  $10,000"  is  $9,000. 
The  amount  assigned  to  the  category  "$500,000  or  more" 


is  $600,000.  Mean  value  is  rounded  to  the  nearest  hundred 
dollars.  (For  more  information  on  aggregates  and  means, 
see  the  discussion  under  "Derived  Measures.") 

Comparability — In  1980,  value  was  asked  only  at  owner- 
occupied  or  vacant-for-sale  one-family  houses  on  fewer 
than  10  acres  with  no  business  or  medical  office  on  the 
property  and  at  all  owner-occupied  or  vacant-for-sale 
condominium  housing  units.  Mobile  homes  were  excluded. 
Value  data  were  presented  for  specified  owner-occupied 
housing  units,  specified  vacant-for-sale-only  housing  units, 
and  owner-occupied  condominium  housing  units. 

In  1990,  the  question  was  asked  at  all  owner-occupied 
or  vacant-for-sale-only  housing  units  with  no  exclusions. 
Data  presented  for  specified  owner-occupied  and  speci- 
fied vacant-for-sale-only  housing  units  will  include  one- 
family  condominium  houses  but  not  condominiums  in 
multi-unit  structures  since  condominium  units  are  now 
identified  only  in  long-form  questionnaires. 

For  1 990,  quartiles  have  been  added  because  the  range 
of  values  and  rents  in  the  United  States  has  increased  in 
recent  years.  Upper  and  lower  quartiles  can  be  used  to 
note  large  value  and  rent  differences  among  various 
geographic  areas. 

VEHICLES  AVAILABLE 

The  data  on  vehicles  available  were  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  HI 3,  which  was  asked  at  occupied 
housing  units.  This  item  was  asked  on  a  sample  basis. 
These  data  show  the  number  of  households  with  a  spec- 
ified number  of  passenger  cars,  vans,  and  pickup  or  panel 
trucks  of  one-ton  capacity  or  less  kept  at  home  and 
available  for  the  use  of  household  members.  Vehicles 
rented  or  leased  for  one  month  or  more,  company  vehi- 
cles, and  police  and  government  vehicles  are  included  if 
kept  at  home  and  used  for  nonbusiness  purposes.  Disman- 
tled or  immobile  vehicles  are  excluded.  Vehicles  kept  at 
home  but  used  only  for  business  purposes  also  are 
excluded. 

Vehicles  Per  Household — This  is  computed  by  dividing 
aggregate  vehicles  available  by  the  number  of  occupied 
housing  units. 

Limitation  of  the  Data — The  1980  census  evaluations 
showed  that  the  number  of  automobiles  was  slightly  over- 
reported;  the  number  of  vans  and  trucks  slightly  underre- 
ported.  The  statistics  do  not  measure  the  number  of 
vehicles  privately  owned  or  the  number  of  households 
owning  vehicles. 

Comparability — Data  on  automobiles  available  were  col- 
lected from  1960  to  1980.  In  1980,  a  separate  question 
also  was  asked  on  the  number  of  trucks  and  vans.  The 
data  on  automobiles  and  trucks  and  vans  were  presented 


i 


B-48 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


separately  and  also  as  a  combined  vehicles  available 
tabulation.  The  1990  data  are  comparable  to  the  1980 
vehicles  available  tabulations. 


YEAR  HOUSEHOLDER  MOVED  INTO  UNIT 

The  data  on  year  householder  moved  into  unit  were 
obtained  from  questionnaire  item  H8,  which  was  asked  at 
occupied  housing  units.  This  item  was  asked  on  a  sample 
basis.  These  data  refer  to  the  year  of  the  latest  move  by 
the  householder.  If  a  householder  moved  back  into  a 
housing  unit  he  or  she  previously  occupied,  the  year  of  the 
latest  move  was  reported.  If  the  householder  moved  from 
one  apartment  to  another  within  the  same  building,  the 
year  the  householder  moved  into  the  present  apartment 
was  reported.  The  intent  is  to  establish  the  year  the 
present  occupancy  by  the  householder  began.  The  year 
that  the  householder  moved  in  is  not  necessarily  the  same 
year  other  members  of  the  household  moved,  although  in 
the  great  majority  of  cases  an  entire  household  moves  at 
the  same  time. 

Comparability— In  1960  and  1970,  this  question  was 
asked  of  every  person  and  included  in  population  reports. 
This  item  in  housing  tabulations  refers  to  the  year  the 
householder  moved  in.  In  1980  and  1990,  the  question 
was  asked  only  of  the  householder. 

YEAR  STRUCTURE  BUILT 

The  data  on  year  structure  built  were  obtained  from 
questionnaire  item  HI  7,  which  was  asked  at  both  occupied 
and  vacant  housing  units.  This  item  was  asked  on  a 
sample  basis.  Data  on  year  structure  built  refer  to  when  the 
building  was  first  constructed,  not  when  it  was  remodeled, 
added  to,  or  converted.  For  housing  units  under  construc- 
tion that  met  the  housing  unit  definition— that  is,  all  exterior 
windows,  doors,  and  final  usable  floors  were  in  place— the 
category  "1989  or  March  1990"  was  used.  For  a  house- 
boat or  a  mobile  home  or  trailer,  the  manufacturer's  model 
year  was  assumed  to  be  the  year  built.  The  figures  shown 
in  census  data  products  relate  to  the  number  of  units  built 
during  the  specified  periods  that  were  still  in  existence  at 
the  time  of  enumeration. 

Median  Year  Structure  Built— The  median  divides  the 
distribution  into  two  equal  parts.  The  median  is  rounded  to 
the  nearest  calendar  year.  Median  age  of  housing  can  be 
obtained  by  subtracting  median  year  structure  built  from 
1990.  For  example,  if  the  median  year  structure  built  is 
1957,  the  median  age  of  housing  in  that  area  is  33  years 
(1990  minus  1957). 

Limitation  of  the  Data— Data  on  year  structure  built  are 
more  susceptible  to  errors  of  response  and  nonreporting 
than  data  on  many  other  items  because  respondents  must 
rely  on  their  memory  or  on  estimates  by  persons  who  have 


lived  in  the  neighborhood  a  long  time.  Available  evidence 
indicates  there  is  underreporting  in  the  older-year-structure- 
built  categories,  especially  "Built  in  1939  or  earlier."  The 
introduction  of  the  "Don't  know"  category  (see  the  discus- 
sion on  "Comparability")  may  have  resulted  in  relatively 
higher  allocation  rates.  Data  users  should  refer  to  the 
discussion  in  Appendix  C,  Accuracy  of  the  Data,  and  to  the 
allocation  tables. 

Comparability— Data  on  year  structure  built  were  col- 
lected for  the  first  time  in  the  1940  census.  Since  then,  the 
response  categories  have  been  modified  to  accommodate 
the  10-year  period  between  each  census.  In  1990,  the 
category,  "Don't  Know,"  was  added  in  an  effort  to  mini- 
mize the  response  error  mentioned  in  the  paragraph  above 
on  limitation  of  the  data. 


DERIVED  MEASURES 

Census  data  products  include  various  derived  mea- 
sures, such  as  medians,  means,  and  percentages,  as  well 
as  certain  rates  and  ratios.  Derived  measures  that  round  to 
less  than  0.1  are  not  shown  but  indicated  as  zero.  In 
printed  reports,  zero  is  indicated  by  a  dash  (-). 

Interpolation 

Interpolation  frequently  is  used  in  calculating  medians 
or  quartiles  based  on  interval  data  and  in  approximating 
standard  errors  from  tables.  Linear  interpolation  is  used  to 
estimate  values  of  a  function  between  two  known  values. 
"Pareto  interpolation"  is  an  alternative  to  linear  interpola- 
tion. It  is  used  by  the  Census  Bureau  in  calculating  median 
income  within  intervals  wider  than  $2,500.  In  Pareto  inter- 
polation, the  median  is  derived  by  interpolating  between 
the  logarithms  of  the  upper  and  lower  income  limits  of  the 
median  category. 

Mean 

This  measure  represents  an  arithmetic  average  of  a  set 
of  values.  It  is  derived  by  dividing  the  sum  of  a  group  of 
numerical  items  (or  aggregate)  by  the  total  number  of 
items.  Aggregates  are  used  in  computing  mean  values.  For 
example,  mean  family  income  is  obtained  by  dividing  the 
aggregate  of  all  income  reported  by  persons  in  families  by 
the  total  number  of  families.  (Additional  information  on 
means  and  aggregates  is  included  in  the  separate  expla- 
nations of  many  population  and  housing  subjects.) 

Median 

This  measure  represents  the  middle  value  in  a  distribu- 
tion. The  median  divides  the  total  frequency  into  two  equal 
parts:  one-half  of  the  cases  fall  below  the  median  and 
one-half  of  the  cases  exceed  the  median.  The  median  is 


DEFINITIONS  OF  SUBJECT  CHARACTERISTICS 


B-49 


computed  on  the  basis  of  the  distribution  as  tabulated, 
which  is  sometimes  more  detailed  than  the  distribution 
shown  in  specific  census  publications  and  other  data 
products. 

In  reports,  if  the  median  falls  within  the  upper  interval  of 
the  tabulation  distribution,  the  median  is  shown  as  the 
initial  value  of  the  interval  followed  by  a  plus  sign  (+);  if 
within  the  lower  interval,  the  median  is  shown  as  the  upper 
value  of  the  category  followed  by  a  minus  sign  (-).  For 
summary  tape  files,  if  the  median  falls  within  the  upper  or 
lower  interval,  it  is  set  to  a  specified  value.  (Additional 
information  on  medians  is  included  in  the  separate  expla- 
nations of  many  population  and  housing  subjects.) 

Percentages,  Rates,  and  Ratios 

These  measures  are  frequently  presented  in  census 
products  to  compare  two  numbers  or  two  sets  of  measure- 
ments. These  comparisons  are  made  in  two  ways:  (1) 


subtraction,  which  provides  an  absolute  measure  of  the 
difference  between  two  items,  and  (2)  the  quotient  of  two 
numbers,  which  provides  a  relative  measure  of  difference. 


Quartile 

This  measure  divides  a  distribution  into  four  equal  parts. 
The  first  quartile  (or  lower  quartile)  is  the  value  that  defines 
the  upper  limit  of  the  lowest  one-quarter  of  the  cases.  The 
second  quartile  is  the  median.  The  third  quartile  (or  upper 
quartile)  defines  the  lower  limit  of  the  upper  one-quarter  of 
the  cases  in  the  distribution.  The  difference  between  the 
upper  and  lower  quartiles  is  called  the  interquartile  range. 
This  interquartile  range  is  less  affected  by  wide  variations 
than  is  the  mean.  Quartiles  are  presented  for  certain 
financial  characteristics  such  as  housing  value  and  rent.

INTRODUCTION 

The  data  contained  in  this  data  product  are  based  on 
the  1990  census  sannple.  The  data  are  estimates  of  the 
actual  figures  that  would  have  been  obtained  from  a 
complete  count.  Estimates  derived  from  a  sample  are 
expected  to  be  different  from  the  100-percent  figures 
because  they  are  subject  to  sampling  and  nonsampling 
errors.  Sampling  error  in  data  arises  from  the  selection  of 
persons  and  housing  units  to  be  included  in  the  sample. 
Nonsampling  error  affects  both  sample  and  100-percent 
data,  and  is  introduced  as  a  result  of  errors  that  may  occur 
dunng  the  collection  and  processing  phases  of  the  census. 
Provided  below  is  a  detailed  discussion  of  both  types  of 
errors  and  a  description  of  the  estimation  procedures. 

SAMPLE  DESIGN 

Every  person  and  housing  unit  in  the  United  States  was 
asked  certain  basic  demographic  and  housing  questions 
(for  example,  race,  age,  marital  status,  housing  value,  or 
rent).  A  sample  of  these  persons  and  housing  units  was 
asked  more  detailed  questions  about  such  items  as  income, 
occupation,  and  housing  costs  in  addition  to  the  basic 
demographic  and  housing  information.  The  primary  sam- 
pling unit  for  the  1990  census  was  the  housing  unit, 
including  all  occupants.  For  persons  living  in  group  quar- 
ters, the  sampling  unit  was  the  person.  Persons  in  group 
quarters  were  sampled  at  a  1  -in-6  rate. 

The  sample  designation  method  depended  on  the  data 
collection  procedures.  Approximately  95  percent  of  the 
population  was  enumerated  by  the  mailback  procedure.  In 
these  areas,  the  Bureau  of  the  Census  either  purchased  a 
commercial  mailing  list,  which  was  updated  by  the  United 
States  Postal  Service  and  Census  Bureau  field  staff,  or 
prepared  a  mailing  list  by  canvassing  and  listing  each 
address  in  the  area  prior  to  Census  Day.  These  lists  were 
computerized  and  the  appropriate  units  were  electronically 
designated  as  sample  units.  The  questionnaires  were 
either  mailed  or  hand-delivered  to  the  addresses  with 
instructions  to  complete  and  mail  back  the  form. 


Housing  units  in  governmental  units  with  a  precensus 
(1988)  estimated  population  of  fewer  than  2,500  persons 
were  sampled  at  1-in-2.  Governmental  units  were  defined 
for  sampling  purposes  as  all  incorporated  places,  all 
counties,  all  county  equivalents  such  as  parishes  in  Loui- 
siana, and  all  minor  civil  divisions  in  Connecticut,  Maine, 
Massachusetts,  Michigan,  Minnesota,  New  Hampshire, 
New  Jersey,  New  York,  Pennsylvania,  Rhode  Island,  Ver- 
mont, and  Wisconsin.  Housing  units  in  census  tracts  and 
block  numbering  areas  (BNA's)  with  a  precensus  housing 
unit  count  below  2,000  housing  units  were  sampled  at 
1-in-6  for  those  portions  not  in  small  governmental  units 
(governmental  units  with  a  population  less  than  2,500). 
Housing  units  within  census  tracts  and  BNA's  with  2,000  or 
more  housing  units  were  sampled  at  1-in-8  for  those 
portions  not  in  small  governmental  units. 

In  list/enumerate  areas  (about  5  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion), each  enumerator  was  given  a  blank  address  register 
with  designated  sample  lines.  Beginning  about  Census 
Day,  the  enumerator  systematically  canvassed  an  assigned 
area  and  listed  all  housing  units  in  the  address  register  in 
the  order  they  were  encountered.  Completed  question- 
naires, including  sample  information  for  any  housing  unit 
listed  on  a  designated  sample  line,  were  collected.  For  all 
governmental  units  with  fewer  than  2,500  persons  in 
list/enumerate  areas,  a  1-in-2  sampling  rate  was  used.  All 
other  list/enumerate  areas  were  sampled  at  1-in-6. 

Housing  units  in  American  Indian  reservations,  tribal 
jurisdiction  statistical  areas,  and  Alaska  Native  villages 
were  sampled  according  to  the  same  criteria  as  other 
governmental  units,  except  the  sampling  rates  were  based 
on  the  size  of  the  American  Indian  and  Alaska  Native 
population  in  those  areas  as  measured  in  the  1 980  census. 
Trust  lands  were  sampled  at  the  same  rate  as  their 
associated  American  Indian  reservations.  Census  desig- 
nated places  in  Hawaii  were  sampled  at  the  same  rate  as 
governmental  units  because  the  Census  Bureau  does  not 
recognize  incorporated  places  in  Hawaii. 

The  purpose  of  using  variable  sampling  rates  was  to 
provide  relatively  more  reliable  estimates  for  small  areas 
and  decrease  respondent  burden  in  more  densely  popu- 
lated areas  while  maintaining  data  reliability.  When  all 
sampling  rates  were  taken  into  account  across  the  Nation, 
approximately  one  out  of.  every  six  housing  units  in  the 
Nation  was  included  in  the  1990  census  sample. 

CONFIDENTIALITY  OF  THE  DATA 

To  maintain  the  confidentiality  required  by  law  (Title  13, 
United  States  Code),  the  Bureau  of  the  Census  applies  a 
confidentiality  edit  to  the  1 990  census  data  to  assure  that 


ACCURACY  OF  THE  DATA 


C-1 


published  data  do  not  disclose  information  about  specific 
individuals,  households,  or  housing  units.  As  a  result,  a 
small  amount  of  uncertainty  is  introduced  into  the  esti- 
mates of  census  characteristics.  The  sample  itself  pro- 
vides adequate  protection  for  most  areas  for  which  sample 
data  are  published  since  the  resulting  data  are  estimates  of 
the  actual  counts;  however,  small  areas  require  more 
protection.  The  edit  is  controlled  so  that  the  basic  structure 
of  the  data  Is  preserved. 

The  confidentiality  edit  is  implemented  by  selecting  a 
small  subset  of  individual  households  from  the  internal 
sample  data  files  and  blanking  a  subset  of  the  data  items 
on  these  household  records.  Responses  to  those  data 
items  were  then  imputed  using  the  same  imputation  pro- 
cedures that  were  used  for  nonresponse.  A  larger  subset 
of  households  is  selected  for  the  confidentiality  edit  for 
small  areas  to  provide  greater  protection  for  these  areas. 
The  editing  process  is  implemented  in  such  a  way  that  the 
quality  and  usefulness  of  the  data  were  preserved. 

ERRORS  IN  THE  DATA 

Since  statistics  in  this  data  product  are  based  on  a 
sample,  they  may  differ  somewhat  from  100-percent  fig- 
ures that  would  have  been  obtained  if  all  housing  units, 
persons  within  those  housing  units,  and  persons  living  in 
group  quarters  had  been  enumerated  using  the  same 
questionnaires,  instructions,  enumerators,  etc.  The  sample 
estimate  also  would  differ  from  other  samples  of  housing 
units,  persons  within  those  housing  units,  and  persons 
living  in  group  quarters.  The  deviation  of  a  sample  estimate 
from  the  average  of  all  possible  samples  is  called  the 
sampling  error.  The  standard  error  of  a  sample  estimate  is 
a  measure  of  the  variation  among  the  estimates  from  all 
the  possible  samples  and  thus  is  a  measure  of  the 
precision  with  which  an  estimate  from  a  particular  sample 
approximates  the  average  result  of  all  possible  samples. 
The  sample  estimate  and  its  estimated  standard  error 
permit  the  construction  of  interval  estimates  with  pre- 
scribed confidence  that  the  interval  includes  the  average 
result  of  all  possible  samples.  Described  below  is  the 
method  of  calculating  standard  errors  and  confidence 
intervals  for  the  data  in  this  product. 

In  addition  to  the  variability  which  arises  from  the 
sampling  procedures,  both  sample  data  and  100-percent 
data  are  subject  to  nonsampling  error.  Nonsampling  error 
may  be  introduced  during  any  of  the  various  complex 
operations  used  to  collect  and  process  census  data.  For 
example,  operations  such  as  editing,  reviewing,  or  han- 
dling questionnaires  may  introduce  error  into  the  data.  A 
detailed  discussion  of  the  sources  of  nonsampling  error  is 
given  in  the  section  on  "Control  of  Nonsampling  Error"  in 
this  appendix. 

Nonsampling  error  may  affect  the  data  in  two  ways. 
Errors  that  are  introduced  randomly  will  increase  the 
variability  of  the  data  and  should  therefore  be  reflected  in 
the  standard  error.  Errors  that  tend  to  be  consistent  in  one 


direction  will  make  both  sample  and  100-percent  data 
biased  in  that  direction.  For  example,  if  respondents 
consistently  tend  to  under-report  their  income,  then  the 
resulting  counts  of  households  or  families  by  income 
category  will  tend  to  be  understated  for  the  higher  income 
categories  and  overstated  for  the  lower  income  categories. 
Such  biases  are  not  reflected  in  the  standard  error. 

Calculation  of  Standard  Errors 

Totals  and  Percentages— Tables  A  through  C  in  this 
appendix  contain  the  information  necessary  to  calculate 
the  standard  errors  of  sample  estimates  in  this  data 
product.  To  calculate  the  standard  error,  it  is  necessary  to 
know  the  basic  standard  error  for  the  characteristic  (given 
in  table  A  or  B)  that  would  result  under  a  simple  random 
sample  design  (of  persons,  households,  or  housing  units) 
and  estimation  technique;  the  design  factor  for  the  partic- 
ular characteristic  estimated  (given  in  table  C);  and  the 
number  of  persons  or  housing  units  in  the  tabulation  area 
and  the  percent  of  these  in  the  sample.  For  machine- 
readable  products,  the  percent-in-sample  is  included  in  a 
data  matrix  on  the  file  for  each  tabulation  area.  In  printed 
reports,  the  percent-in-sample  is  provided  in  data  tables  at 
the  end  of  the  statistical  tables  that  compose  the  report. 
The  design  factors  reflect  the  effects  of  the  actual  sample 
design  and  complex  ratio  estimation  procedure  used  for 
the  1990  census.  Tape  purchasers  will  receive  table  C,  the 
table  of  design  factors,  as  a  supplement  to  the  technical 
documentation.  Table  C  is  included  in  this  appendix  for 
printed  reports. 

The  steps  given  below  should  be  used  to  calculate  the 
standard  error  of  an  estimate  of  a  total  or  a  percentage 
contained  in  this  product.  A  percentage  is  defined  here  as 
a  ratio  of  a  numerator  to  a  denominator  where  the  numer- 
ator is  a  subset  of  the  denominator.  For  example,  the 
proportion  of  Black  teachers  is  the  ratio  of  Black  teachers 
to  all  teachers. 

1 .  Obtain  the  standard  error  from  table  A  or  B  (or  use 
the  formula  given  below  the  table)  for  the  estimated 
total  or  percentage,  respectively. 

2.  Find  the  geographic  area  to  which  the  estimate 
applies  in  the  appropriate  percent-in-sample  table 
or  appropriate  matrix,  and  obtain  the  person  or 
housing  unit  "percent-in-sample"  figure  for  this 
area.  Use  the  person  "percent-in-sample"  figure  for 
person  and  family  characteristics.  Use  the  housing 
unit  "percent-in-sample"  figure  for  housing  unit 
characteristics. 

3.  Use  table  C  to  obtain  the  design  factor  for  the 
characteristic  (for  example,  employment  status,  school 
enrollment)  and  the  range  that  contains  the  percent- 
in-sample  with  which  you  are  working.  Multiply  the 
basic  standard  error  by  this  factor. 

The  unadjusted  standard  errors  of  zero  estimates  or  of 
very  small  estimated  totals  or  percentages  will  approach 
zero.  This  is  also  the  case  for  very  large  percentages  or

ACCURACY  OF  THE  DATA 


estimated  totals  that  are  close  to  the  size  of  the  tabulation 
areas  to  which  they  correspond.  Nevertheless,  these  esti- 
mated totals  and  percentages  still  are  subject  to  sampling 
and  nonsampling  variability,  and  an  estimated  standard 
error  of  zero  (or  a  very  small  standard  error)  is  not 
appropriate.  For  estimated  percentages  that  are  less  than 
2  or  greater  than  98,  use  the  basic  standard  errors  in  table 
B  that  appear  in  the  "2  or  98"  row.  For  an  estimated  total 
that  is  less  than  50  or  within  50  of  the  total  size  of  the 
tabulation  area,  use  a  basic  standard  error  of  1 6. 

An  illustration  of  the  use  of  the  tables  is  given  in  the 
section  entitled  "Use  of  Tables  to  Compute  Standard 
Errors." 

Sums  and  Differences— The  standard  errors  estimated 
from  these  tables  are  not  directly  applicable  to  sums  of  and 
differences  between  two  sample  estimates.  To  estimate 
the  standard  error  of  a  sum  or  difference,  the  tables  are  to 
be  used  somewhat  differently  in  the  following  three  situa- 
tions: 


1 


If 


For  the  sum  of  or  difference  between  a  sample 
estimate  and  a  1 00-percent  value,  use  the  standard 
error  of  the  sample  estimate.  The  complete  count 
value  is  not  subject  to  sampling  error. 

For  the  sum  of  or  difference  between  two  sample 
estimates,  the  appropriate  standard  error  is  approx- 
imately the  square  root  of  the  sum  of  the  two 
individual  standard  errors  squared;  that  is,  for  stand- 
ard errors: 


SE  X  and  SE  y  of  estimates  X  and  Y : 


SE 


(X  +  Y) 


SE,x_Y,  =  V(SEx)'+(Se;)2 


This  method,  however,  will  underestimate  (over- 
estimate) the  standard  error  if  the  two  items  in  a 
sum  are  highly  positively  (negatively)  correlated  or  if 
the  two  items  in  a  difference  are  highly  negatively 
(positively)  correlated.  This  method  may  also  be 
used  for  the  difference  between  (or  sum  of)  sample 
estimates  from  two  censuses  or  from  a  census 
sample  and  another  survey.  The  standard  error  for 
estimates  not  based  on  the  1990  census  sample 
must  be  obtained  from  an  appropriate  source  out- 
side of  this  appendix. 

3.  For  the  differences  between  two  estimates,  one  of 
which  is  a  subclass  of  the  other,  use  the  tables 
directly  where  the  calculated  difference  is  the  esti- 
mate of  interest.  For  example,  to  determine  the 
estimate  of  non-Black  teachers,  one  may  subtract 
the  estimate  of  Black  teachers  from  the  estimate  of 
total  teachers.  To  determine  the  standard  error  of 
the  estimate  of  non-Black  teachers  apply  the  above 
formula  directly. 

Ratios— Frequently,  the  statistic  of  interest  is  the  ratio  of 
two  variables,  where  the  numerator  is  not  a  subset  of  the 


denominator.  For  example,  the  ratio  of  teachers  to  stu- 
dents in  public  elementary  schools.  The  standard  error  of 
the  ratio  between  two  sample  estimates  is  estimated  as 
follows: 

1 .  If  the  ratio  is  a  proportion,  then  follow  the  procedure 
outlined  for  "Totals  and  Percentages." 

2.  If  the  ratio  is  not  a  proportion,  then  approximate  the 
standard  error  using  the  formula  below.

Medians — For  the  standard  error  of  the  median  of  a 
characteristic,  it  is  necessary  to  examine  the  distribution 
from  which  the  median  is  derived,  as  the  size  of  the  base 
and  the  distribution  itself  affect  the  standard  error.  An 
approximate  method  is  given  here.  As  the  first  step, 
compute  one-half  of  the  number  on  which  the  median  .is 
based  (refer  to  this  result  as  N/2).  Treat  N/2  as  if  it  were 
an  ordinary  estimate  and  obtain  its  standard  error  as 
instructed  above.  Compute  the  desired  confidence  interval 
about  N/2.  Starting  with  the  lowest  value  of  the  character- 
istic, cumulate  the  frequencies  in  each  category  of  the 
characteristic  until  the  sum  equals  or  first  exceeds  the 
lower  limit  of  the  confidence  interval  about  N/2.  By  linear 
interpolation,  obtain  a  value  of  the  characteristic  corre- 
sponding to  this  sum.  This  is  the  lower  limit  of  the 
confidence  interval  of  the  median.  In  a  similar  manner, 
continue  cumulating  frequencies  until  the  sum  equals  or 
exceeds  the  count  in  excess  of  the  upper  limit  of  the 
interval  about  N/2.  Interpolate  as  before  to  obtain  the 
upper  limit  of  the  confidence  interval  for  the  estimated 
median. 

When  interpolation  is  required  in  the  upper  open-ended 
interval  of  a  distribution  to  obtain  a  confidence  bound,  use 
1.5  times  the  lower  limit  of  the  open-ended  confidence 
interval  as  the  upper  limit  of  the  open-ended  interval. 

Confidence  Intervals 

A  sample  estimate  and  its  estimated  standard  error  may 
be  used  to  construct  confidence  intervals  about  the  esti- 
mate. These  intervals  are  ranges  that  will  contain  the 
average  value  of  the  estimated  characteristic  that  results 
over  all  possible  samples,  with  a  known  probability.  For 
example,  if  all  possible  samples  that  could  result  under  the 
1990  census  sample  design  were  independently  selected 
and  surveyed  under  the  same  conditions,  and  if  the 
estimate  and  its  estimated  standard  error  were  calculated 
for  each  of  these  samples,  then: 

1 .  Approximately  68  percent  of  the  intervals  from  one 
estimated  standard  error  below  the  estimate  to  one 
estimated  standard  error  above  the  estimate  would 
contain  the  average  result  from  all  possible  sam- 
ples; 


ACCURACY  OF  THE  DATA

2.  Approximately  90  percent  of  the  intervals  from 
1 .645  times  the  estimated  standard  error  below  the 
estimate  to  1.645  times  the  estimated  standard 
error  above  the  estimate  would  contain  the  average 
result  from  all  possible  samples. 

3.  Approximately  95  percent  of  the  intervals  from  two 
estimated  standard  errors  below  the  estimate  to 
two  estimated  standard  errors  above  the  estimate 
would  contain  the  average  result  from  all  possible 
samples. 

The  intervals  are  referred  to  as  68  percent,  90  percent, 
and  95  percent  confidence  intervals,  respectively. 

The  average  value  of  the  estimated  characteristic  that 
could  be  derived  from  all  possible  samples  is  or  is  not 
contained  in  any  particular  computed  interval.  Thus,  we 
cannot  make  the  statement  that  the  average  value  has  a 
certain  probability  of  falling  between  the  limits  of  the 
calculated  confidence  interval.  Rather,  one  can  say  with  a 
specified  probability  of  confidence  that  the  calculated 
confidence  interval  includes  the  average  estimate  from  all 
possible  samples  (approximately  the  100-percent  value). 

Confidence  intervals  also  may  be  constructed  for  the 
ratio,  sum  of,  or  difference  between  two  sample  figures. 
This  is  done  by  first  computing  the  ratio,  sum,  or  difference, 
then  obtaining  the  standard  error  of  the  ratio,  sum,  or 
difference  (using  the  formulas  given  earlier),  and  finally 
forming  a  confidence  interval  for  this  estimated  ratio,  sum, 
or  difference  as  above.  One  can  then  say  with  specified 
confidence  that  this  interval  includes  the  ratio,  sum,  or 
difference  that  would  have  been  obtained  by  averaging  the 
results  from  all  possible  samples. 

The  estimated  standard  errors  given  in  this  appendix  do 
not  include  all  portions  of  the  variability  due  to  nonsam- 
pling  error  that  may  be  present  in  the  data.  The  standard 
errors  reflect  the  effect  of  simple  response  variance,  but 
not  the  effect  of  correlated  errors  introduced  by  enumer- 
ators, coders,  or  other  field  or  processing  personnel.  Thus, 
the  standard  errors  calculated  represent  a  lower  bound  of 
the  total  error.  As  a  result,  confidence  intervals  formed 
using  these  estimated  standard  errors  may  not  meet  the 
stated  levels  of  confidence  (i.e.,  68,  90,  or  95  percent). 
Thus,  some  care  must  be  exercised  in  the  interpretation  of 
the  data  in  this  data  product  based  on  the  estimated 
standard  errors. 

A  standard  sampling  theory  text  should  be  helpful  if  the 
user  needs  more  information  about  confidence  intervals 
and  nonsampling  errors. 

Use  of  Tables  to  Compute  Standard  Errors 

The  following  is  a  hypothetical  example  of  how  to 
compute  a  standard  error  of  a  total  and  a  percentage. 
Suppose  a  particular  data  table  shows  that  for  City  A  9,948 
persons  out  of  all  15,888  persons  age  16  years  and  over 
were  in  the  civilian  labor  force.  The  percent-in-sample 


table  lists  City  A  with  a  percent-in-sample  of  16.0  percent 
(Persons  column).  The  column  in  table  C  which  includes 
16.0  percent-in-sample  shows  the  design  factor  to  be  1.1 
for  "Employment  status." 

The  basic  standard  error  for  the  estimated  total  9,948 
may  be  obtained  from  table  A  or  from  the  formula  given 
below  table  A.  In  order  to  avoid  interpolation,  the  use  of  the 
formula  will  be  demonstrated  here.  Suppose  that  the  total 
population  of  City  A  was  21 ,220.  The  formula  for  the  basic 
standard  error,  SE,  is 

SE(9,948)  =  \/5(9,948)  (1-9,948/21,220) 
=  163  persons. 

The  standard  error  of  the  estimated  9,948  persons  16 
years  and  over  who  were  in  the  civilian  labor  force  is  found 
by  multiplying  the  basic  standard  error  1 63  by  the  design 
factor,  1.1  from  table  C.  This  yields  an  estimated  standard 
error  of  179  for  the  total  number  of  persons  16  years  and 
over  in  City  A  who  were  in  the  civilian  labor  force. 

The  estimated  percent  of  persons  16  years  and  over 
who  were  in  the  civilian  labor  force  in  City  A  is  62.6.  From 
table  B,  the  unadjusted  standard  error  is  found  to  be 
approximately  0.85  percentage  points.  The  standard  error 
for  the  estimated  62.6  percent  of  persons  16  years  and 
over  who  were  in  the  civilian  labor  force  is  0.85  x  1.1  = 
0.94  percentage  points. 

A  note  of  caution  concerning  numerical  values  is  nec- 
essary. Standard  errors  of  percentages  derived  in  this 
manner  are  approximate.  Calculations  can  be  expressed 
to  several  decimal  places,  but  to  do  so  would  indicate  more 
precision  in  the  data  than  is  justifiable.  Final  results  should 
contain  no  more  than  two  decimal  places  when  the 
estimated  standard  error  is  one  percentage  point  (i.e., 
1.00)  or  more. 

In  the  previous  example,  the  standard  error  of  the  9,948 
persons  1 6  years  and  over  in  City  A  who  were  in  the  civilian 
labor  force  was  found  to  be  179.  Thus,  a  90  percent 
confidence  interval  for  this  estimated  total  is  found  to  be: 

[9,948  -  1.645(179)]  to  [9,948  -I-  1.645(179)] 
or 
9,654  to  10,242 

One  can  say,  with  about  90  percent  confidence,  that  this 
interval  includes  the  value  that  would  have  been  obtained 
by  averaging  the  results  from  all  possible  samples. 

The  following  is  an  illustration  of  the  calculation  of 
standard  errors  and  confidence  intervals  when  a  differ- 
ence between  two  sample  estimates  is  obtained.  For 
example,  suppose  the  number  of  persons  in  City  B  age  16 
years  and  over  who  were  in  the  civilian  labor  force  was 
9,314  and  the  total  number  of  persons  16  years  and  over 
was  16,666.  Further  suppose  the  population  of  City  B  was 
25,225.  Thus,  the  estimated  percentage  of  persons  16 
years  and  over  who  were  in  the  civilian  labor  force  is  55.9 
percent.  The  unadjusted  standard  error  determined  using 
the  formula  provided  at  the  bottom  of  table  B  is  0.86 


C-4 


ACCURACY  OF  THE  DATA 


percentage  points.  We  find  that  City  B  had  a  percent-in- 
sample  of  15.7.  The  range  which  includes  15.7  percent-in- 
sample  in  table  C  shows  the  design  factor  to  be  1.1  for 
"Employment  Status."  Thus,  the  approximate  standard 
error  of  the  percentage  (55.9  percent)  is  0.86  x  1 .1  =  0.95 
percentage  points. 

Now  suppose  that  one  wished  to  obtain  the  standard 
error  of  the  difference  between  City  A  and  City  B  of  the 
percentages  of  persons  who  were  16  years  and  over  and 
who  were  in  the  civilian  labor  force.  The  difference  in  the 
percentages  of  interest  for  the  two  cities  is: 

62.6  -  55.9  =  6.7  percent. 

Using  the  results  of  the  previous  example: 


SE(6.7)  =\/(SE(62.6))2  +  (SE(55.9))2=A/(0.94)2+ (0.95)2 

=  1 .34  percentage  points 
The  90  percent  confidence  interval  for  the  difference  Is 


formed  as  before: 

[6.70  -  1.645(1.34)]  to  [6.70  - 
or 
4.50  to  8.90 


1.645(1.34)] 


One  can  say  with  90  percent  confidence  that  the 
interval  includes  the  difference  that  would  have  been 
obtained  by  averaging  the  results  from  all  possible  sam- 
ples. 

For  reasonably  large  samples,  ratio  estimates  are  nor- 
mally distributed,  particularly  for  the  census  population. 
Therefore,  if  we  can  calculate  the  standard  error  of  a  ratio 
estimate  then  we  can  form  a  confidence  interval  around 
the  ratio.  Suppose  that  one  wished  to  obtain  the  standard 
error  of  the  ratio  of  the  estimate  of  persons  who  were  1 6 
years  and  over  and  who  were  in  the  civilian  labor  force  in 
City  A  to  the  estimate  of  persons  who  were  1 6  years  and 
over  and  who  were  in  the  civilian  labor  force  in  City  B.  The 
ratio  of  the  two  estimates  of  interest  is: 

9948/9314  =  1.07

Using  the  results  above,  the  90  percent  confidence

or

ESTIMATION  PROCEDURE 

The  estimates  which  appear  in  this  publication  were 
obtained  from  an  iterative  ratio  estimation  procedure  (iter- 
ative proportional  fitting)  resulting  in  the  assignment  of  a 
weight  to  each  sample  person  or  housing  unit  record.  For 


any  given  tabulation  area,  a  characteristic  total  was  esti- 
mated by  summing  the  weights  assigned  to  the  persons  or 
housing  units  possessing  the  characteristic  in  the  tabula- 
tion area.  Estimates  of  family  or  household  characteristics 
were  based  on  the  weight  assigned  to  the  family  member 
designated  as  householder.  Each  sample  person  or  hous- 
ing unit  record  was  assigned  exactly  one  weight  to  be  used 
to  produce  estimates  of  all  characteristics.  For  example,  if 
the  weight  given  to  a  sample  person  or  housing  unit  had 
the  value  6,  all  characteristics  of  that  person  or  housing 
unit  would  be  tabulated  with  the  weight  of  6.  The  estima- 
tion procedure,  however,  did  assign  weights  varying  from 
person  to  person  or  housing  unit  to  housing  unit.  The 
estimation  procedure  used  to  assign  the  weights  was 
performed  in  geographically  defined  "weighting  areas." 
Weighting  areas  generally  were  formed  of  contiguous 
geographic  units  which  agreed  closely  with  census  tabu- 
lation areas  within  counties.  Weighting  areas  were  required 
to  have  a  minimum  sample  of  400  persons.  Weighting 
areas  never  crossed  State  or  county  boundaries.  In  small 
counties  with  a  sample  count  below  400  persons,  the 
minimum  required  sample  condition  was  relaxed  to  permit 
the  entire  county  to  become  a  weighting  area. 

Within  a  weighting  area,  the  ratio  estimation  procedure 
for  persons  was  performed  in  four  stages.  For  persons,  the 
first  stage  applied  1 7  household-type  groups.  The  second 
stage  used  two  groups:  sampling  rate  of  1-in-2;  sampling 
rate  less  than  1-in-2.  The  third  stage  used  the  dichotomy 
householders/nonhouseholders.  The  fourth  stage  applied 
180  aggregate  age-sex-race-Hispanic  origin  categories. 
The  stages  were  as  follows:

Within  a  weighting  area,  the  first  step  in  the  estimation 
procedure  was  to  assign  an  initial  weight  to  each  sample 
person  record.  This  weight  was  approximately  equal  to  the 
inverse  of  the  probability  of  selecting  a  person  for  the 
census  sample. 

The  next  step  in  the  estimation  procedure,  prior  to 
iterative  proportional  fitting,  was  to  combine  categories  in 
each  of  the  four  estimation  stages,  when  needed  to 
increase  the  reliability  of  the  ratio  estimation  procedure. 
For  each  stage,  any  group  that  did  not  meet  certain  criteria 
for  the  unweighted  sample  count  or  for  the  ratio  of  the 
100-percent  to  the  initially  weighted  sample  count,  was 
combined,  or  collapsed,  with  another  group  in  the  same 
stage  according  to  a  specified  collapsing  pattern.  At  the 
fourth  stage,  an  additional  criterion  concerning  the  number 
of  complete  count  persons  in  each  race/Hispanic  origin 
category  was  applied. 


As  the  final  step,  the  initial  weights  underwent  four; 
stages  of  ratio  adjustment  applying  the  grouping  proce- 
dures described  above.  At  the  first  stage,  the  ratio  of  the 
complete  census  count  to  the  sum  of  the  initial  weights  for 
each  sample  person  was  computed  for  each  stage  I  group. 
The  initial  weight  assigned  to  each  person  in  a  group  was 
then  multiplied  by  the  stage  I  group  ratio  to  produce  an; 
adjusted  weight. 

In  stage  II,  the  stage  I  adjusted  weights  were  again  , 
adjusted  by  the  ratio  of  the  complete  census  count  to  the 
sum  of  the  stage  I  weights  for  sample  persons  in  each ; 
stage  II  group.  Next,  at  stage  III,  the  stage  II  weights  were 
adjusted  by  the  ratio  of  the  complete  census  count  to  the 
sum  of  the  stage  II  weights  for  sample  persons  in  each 
stage  III  group.  Finally,  at  stage  IV,  the  stage  III  weights 
were  adjusted  by  the  ratio  of  the  complete  census  count  to  • 
the  sum  of  the  stage  III  weights  for  sample  persons  in  each 
stage  IV  group.  The  four  stages  of  ratio  adjustment  were  , 
performed  two  times  (two  iterations)  in  the  order  given 
above.  The  weights  obtained  from  the  second  iteration  for 
stage  IV  were  assigned  to  the  sample  person  records.  = 
However,  to  avoid  complications  in  rounding  for  tabulated 
data,  only  whole  number  weights  were  assigned.  For 
example,  if  the  final  weight  of  the  persons  in  a  particular 
group  was  7.25  then  1/4  of  the  sample  persons  in  this 
group  were  randomly  assigned  a  weight  of  8,  while  the  ; 
remaining  3/4  received  a  weight  of  7. 

The  ratio  estimation  procedure  for  housing  units  was  , 
essentially  the  same  as  that  for  persons,  except  that 
vacant  units  were  treated  differently.  The  occupied  hous- 
ing unit  ratio  estimation  procedure  was  done  in  four  stages, 
and  the  vacant  housing  unit  ratio  estimation  procedure  was  ; 
done  in  a  single  stage.  The  first  stage  for  occupied  housing  ' 
units  applied   16  household  type  categories,  while  the 
second  stage  used  the  two  sampling  categories  described 
above  for  persons.  The  third  stage  applied  three  units-in- 
structure  categories;  i.e.  single  units,  multi-unit  less  than  10 
and  multi-unit  10  or  more.  The  fourth  stage  could  poten- 
tially use  200  tenure-race-Hispanic  origin-value/rent  groups. 
The  stages  for  ratio  estimation  for  housing  units  were  as 
follows:

The  estimates  produced  by  this  procedure  realize  some 
of  the  gains  In  sampling  efficiency  that  would  have  resulted 
if  the  population  had  been  stratified  into  the  ratio  estima- 
tion groups  before  sampling,  and  If  the  sampling  rate  had 
been  applied  Independently  to  each  group.  The  net  effect 
is  a  reduction  in  both  the  standard  error  and  the  possible 
bias  of  most  estimated  characteristics  to  levels  below  what 
would  have  resulted  from  simply  using  the  Initial,  unad- 
justed weight.  A  by-product  of  this  estimation  procedure  is 
that  the  estimates  from  the  sample  will,  for  the  most  part, 
be  consistent  with  the  complete  count  figures  for  the 
population  and  housing  unit  groups  used  in  the  estimation 
procedure. 


ACCURACY  OF  THE  DATA 


C-7 


Control  of  Nonsampling  Error 

As  mentioned  earlier,  both  sample  and  100-percent 
data  are  subject  to  nonsampling  error.  This  component  of 
error  could  introduce  serious  bias  into  the  data,  and  the 
total  error  could  Increase  dramatically  over  that  which 
would  result  purely  from  sampling.  While  it  is  impossible  to 
completely  eliminate  nonsampling  error  from  an  operation 
as  large  and  complex  as  the  decennial  census,  the  Bureau 
of  the  Census  attempted  to  control  the  sources  of  such 
error  during  the  collection  and  processing  operations. 
Described  below  are  the  primary  sources  of  nonsampling 
error  and  the  programs  instituted  for  control  of  this  error. 
The  success  of  these  programs,  however,  was  contingent 
upon  how  well  the  instructions  actually  were  carried  out 
during  the  census.  As  part  of  the  1990  census  evaluation 
program,  both  the  effects  of  these  programs  and  the 
amount  of  error  remaining  after  their  application  will  be 
evaluated. 

Undercoverage— It  is  possible  for  some  households  or 
persons  to  be  missed  entirely  by  the  census.  The  under- 
coverage of  persons  and  housing  units  can  introduce 
biases  into  the  data. 

Several  coverage  improvement  programs  were  imple- 
mented during  the  development  of  the  census  address  list 
and  census  enumeration  and  processing  to  minimize  under- 
coverage of  the  population  and  housing  units.  These 
programs  were  developed  based  on  experience  from  the 
1980  census  and  results  from  the  1990  census  testing 
cycle.  In  developing  and  updating  the  census  address  list, 
the  Census  Bureau  used  a  variety  of  specialized  proce- 
dures in  different  parts  of  the  country. 

•  In  the  large  urban  areas,  the  Census  Bureau  purchased 
and  geocoded  address  lists.  Concurrent  with  geocoding, 
the  United  States  Postal  Service  (USPS)  reviewed  and 
updated  this  list.  After  the  postal  check,  census  enumer- 
ators conducted  a  dependent  canvass  and  update  oper- 
ation. In  the  fall  of  1989,  local  officials  were  given  the 
opportunity  to  examine  block  counts  of  address  listings 
(local  review)  and  identify  possible  errors.  Prior  to  mail- 
out,  the  USPS  conducted  a  final  review. 

•  In  small  cities,  suburban  areas,  and  selected  rural  parts 
of  the  country,  the  Census  Bureau  created  the  address 
list  through  a  listing  operation.  The  USPS  reviewed  and 
updated  this  list,  and  the  Census  Bureau  reconciled 
USPS  corrections  and  updated  through  a  field  operation. 
In  the  fall  of  1989,  local  officials  participated  in  reviewing 
block  counts  of  address  listings.  Prior  to  mailout,  the 
USPS  conducted  a  final  review. 

•  The  Census  Bureau  (rather  than  the  USPS)  conducted  a 
listing  operation  in  the  fall  of  1989  and  delivered  census 
questionnaires  in  selected  rural  and  seasonal  housing 
areas  in  March  of  1990.  In  some  inner-city  public  hous- 
ing developments,  whose  addresses  had  been  obtained 
via  the  purchased  address  list  noted  above,  census 
questionnaires  were  also  delivered  by  Census  Bureau 
enumerators. 


Coverage  improvement  programs  continued  during  and 
after  mailout.  A  recheck  of  units  initially  classified  as 
vacant  or  nonexistent  improved  further  the  coverage  of 
persons  and  housing  units.  All  local  officials  were  given  the 
opportunity  to  participate  in  a  post-census  local  review, 
and  census  enumerators  conducted  an  additional  recan- 
vass.  In  addition,  efforts  were  made  to  improve  the  cover- 
age of  unique  population  groups,  such  as  the  homeless 
and  parolees/probationers.  Computer  and  clerical  edits 
and  telephone  and  personal  visit  followup  also  contributed 
to  improved  coverage. 

More  extensive  discussion  of  the  programs  implemented 
to  improve  coverage  will  be  published  by  the  Census 
Bureau  when  the  evaluation  of  the  coverage  improvement 
program  is  completed. 

Respondent  and  Enumerator  Error— The  person  answer- 
ing the  questionnaire  or  responding  to  the  questions  posed 
by  an  enumerator  could  serve  as  a  source  of  error, 
although  the  questions  were  phrased  as  clearly  as  possi- 
ble based  on  precensus  tests,  and  detailed  instructions  for 
completing  the  questionnaire  were  provided  to  each  house- 
hold. In  addition,  respondents'  answers  were  edited  for 
completeness  and  consistency,  and  problems  were  fol- 
lowed up  as  necessary. 

The  enumerator  may  misinterpret  or  otherwise  incor- 
rectly record  information  given  by  a  respondent;  may  fail  to 
collect  some  of  the  information  for  a  person  or  household; 
or  may  collect  data  for  households  that  were  not  desig- 
nated as  part  of  the  sample.  To  control  these  problems, 
the  work  of  enumerators  was  monitored  carefully.  Field 
staff  were  prepared  for  their  tasks  by  using  standardized 
training  packages  that  included  hands-on  experience  in 
using  census  materials.  A  sample  of  the  households 
interviewed  by  enumerators  for  nonresponse  were  reinter- 
viewed  to  control  for  the  possibility  of  data  for  fabricated 
persons  being  submitted  by  enumerators.  Also,  the  esti- 
mation procedure  was  designed  to  control  for  biases  that 
would  result  from  the  collection  of  data  from  households 
not  designated  for  the  sample. 

Processing  Error — The  many  phases  involved  in  process- 
ing the  census  data  represent  potential  sources  for  the 
introduction  of  nonsampling  error.  The  processing  of  the 
census  questionnaires  includes  the  field  editing,  followup, 
and  transmittal  of  completed  questionnaires;  the  manual 
coding  of  write-in  responses;  and  the  electronic  data 
processing.  The  various  field,  coding  and  computer  oper- 
ations undergo  a  number  of  quality  control  checks  to 
insure  their  accurate  application. 

Nonresponse — Nonresponse  to  particular  questions  on 
the  census  questionnaire  allows  for  the  introduction  of  bias 
into  the  data,  since  the  characteristics  of  the  nonrespon- 
dents  have  not  been  observed  and  may  differ  from  those 
reported  by  respondents.  As  a  result,  any  imputation 
procedure  using  respondent  data  may  not  completely 


C-8 


ACCURACY  OF  THE  DATA   " 


reflect  this  difference  either  at  the  elemental  level  (individ- 
ual person  or  housing  unit)  or  on  the  average.  Some 
protection  against  the  introduction  of  large  biases  is  afforded 
by  minimizing  nonresponse.  In  the  census,  nonresponse 
was  reduced  substantially  during  the  field  operations  by 
the  various  edit  and  followup  operations  aimed  at  obtaining 
a  response  for  every  question.  Characteristics  for  the 
nonresponses  remaining  after  this  operation  were  imputed 
by  the  computer  by  using  reported  data  for  a  person  or 
housing  unit  with  similar  characteristics. 

EDITING  OF  UNACCEPTABLE  DATA 

The  objective  of  the  processing  operation  is  to  produce 
a  set  of  data  that  describes  the  population  as  accurately 
and  clearly  as  possible.  To  meet  this  objective,  question- 
naires were  edited  during  field  data  collection  operations 
for  consistency,  completeness,  and  acceptability.  Ques- 
tionnaires also  were  reviewed  by  census  clerks  for  omis- 
sions, certain  specific  inconsistencies,  and  population  cov- 
erage. For  example,  write-in  entries  such  as  "Don't  know" 
or  "NA"  were  considered  unacceptable.  For  some  district 
offices,  the  initial  edit  was  automated;  however,  for  the 
majority  of  the  district  offices,  it  was  performed  by  clerks. 
As  a  result  of  this  operation,  a  telephone  or  personal  visit 
followup  was  made  to  obtain  missing  information.  Potential 
coverage  errors  were  included  in  the  followup,  as  well  as  a 
sample  of  questionnaires  with  omissions  and/or  inconsis- 
tencies. 

Subsequent  to  field  operations,  remaining  incomplete  or 
inconsistent  information  on  the  questionnaires  was  assigned 


using  imputation  procedures  during  the  final  automated 
edit  of  the  collected  data.  Imputations,  or  computer  assign- 
ments of  acceptable  codes  in  place  of  unacceptable 
entries  or  blanks,  are  needed  most  often  when  an  entry  for 
a  given  item  is  lacking  or  when  the  information  reported  for 
a  person  or  housing  unit  on  that  item  is  inconsistent  with 
other  information  for  that  same  person  or  housing  unit.  As 
in  previous  censuses,  the  general  procedure  for  changing 
unacceptable  entries  was  to  assign  an  entry  for  a  person 
or  housing  unit  that  was  consistent  with  entries  for  persons 
or  housing  units  with  similar  characteristics.  The  assign- 
ment of  acceptable  codes  in  place  of  blanks  or  unaccept- 
able entries  enhances  the  usefulness  of  the  data. 

Another  way  in  which  corrections  were  made  during  the 
computer  editing  process  was  through  substitution;  that  is, 
the  assignment  of  a  full  set  of  characteristics  for  a  person 
or  housing  unit.  When  there  was  an  indication  that  a 
housing  unit  was  occupied  but  the  questionnaire  contained 
no  information  for  the  people  within  the  household  or  the 
occupants  were  not  listed  on  the  questionnaire,  a  previ- 
ously accepted  household  was  selected  as  a  substitute, 
and  the  full  set  of  characteristics  for  the  substitute  was 
duplicated.  The  assignment  of  the  full  set  of  housing 
characteristics  occurred  when  there  was  no  housing  infor- 
mation available.  If  the  housing  unit  was  determined  to  be 
occupied,  the  housing  characteristics  were  assigned  from 
a  previously  processed  occupied  unit.  If  the  housing  unit 
was  vacant,  the  housing  characteristics  were  assigned 
from  a  previously  processed  vacant  unit.

and  private  businesses  and  students,  were  not  enumer- 
ated, nor  were  their  counts  obtained  fronn  adnninistrative 
sources.  On  the  other  hand,  Americans  temporarily  over- 
seas were  to  be  enumerated  at  their  usual  residence  in  the 
United  States. 


ENUMERATION  AND  RESIDENCE  RULES 

In  accordance  with  census  practice  dating  back  to  the 
first  United  States  census  in  1790,  each  person  was  to  be 
enumerated  as  an  inhabitant  of  his  or  her  "usual  resi- 
dence" in  the  1990  census.  Usual  residence  is  the  place 
where  the  person  lives  and  sleeps  most  of  the  time  or 
considers  to  be  his  or  her  usual  residence.  This  place  is  not 
necessarily  the  same  as  the  person's  legal  residence  or 
voting  residence.  In  the  vast  majority  of  cases,  however, 
the  use  of  these  different  bases  of  classification  would 
produce  substantially  the  same  statistics,  although  there 
might  be  appreciable  differences  for  a  few  areas. 

The  implementation  of  this  practice  has  resulted  in  the 
establishment  of  rules  for  certain  categories  of  persons 
whose  usual  place  of  residence  is  not  immediately  appar- 
ent. Furthermore,  this  practice  means  that  persons  were 
not  always  counted  as  residents  of  the  place  where  they 
happened  to  be  staying  on  Census  Day  (April  1,  1990). 

Enumeration  Rules 

Each  person  whose  usual  residence  was  in  the  United 
States  was  to  be  included  in  the  census,  without  regard  to 
the  person's  legal  status  or  citizenship.  In  a  departure  from 
earlier  censuses,  foreign  diplomatic  personnel  participated 
voluntarily  in  the  census,  regardless  of  their  residence  on 
or  off  the  premises  of  an  embassy.  As  in  previous  cen- 
suses, persons  in  the  United  States  specifically  excluded 
from  the  census  were  foreign  travelers  who  had  not 
established  a  residence. 

Americans  with  a  usual  residence  outside  the  United 
States  were  not  enumerated  in  the  1990  census.  United 
States  military  and  Federal  civilian  employees,  and  their 
dependents  overseas,  are  included  in  the  population  counts 
for  States  for  purposes  of  Congressional  apportionment, 
but  are  excluded  from  all  other  tabulations  for  States  and 
their  subdivisions.  The  counts  of  United  States  military  and 
Federal  civilian  employees,  and  their  dependents,  were 
obtained  from  administrative  records  maintained  by  Fed- 
eral departments  and  agencies.  Other  Americans  living 
overseas,  such  as  employees  of  international  agencies 


Residence  Rules 

Each  person  included  in  the  census  was  to  be  counted 
at  his  or  her  usual  residence — the  place  where  he  or  she 
lives  and  sleeps  most  of  the  time  or  the  place  where  the 
person  considers  to  be  his  or  her  usual  home.  If  a  person 
had  no  usual  residence,  the  person  was  to  be  counted 
where  he  or  she  was  staying  on  April  1,  1990. 

Persons  temporarily  away  from  their  usual  residence, 
whether  in  the  United  States  or  overseas,  on  a  vacation  or 
on  a  business  trip,  were  counted  at  their  usual  residence. 
Persons  who  occupied  more  than  one  residence  during  the 
year  were  counted  at  the  one  they  considered  to  be  their 
usual  residence.  Persons  who  moved  on  or  near  Census 
Day  were  counted  at  the  place  they  considered  to  be  their 
usual  residence. 

Persons  In  the  Armed  Forces— Members  of  the  Armed 
Forces  were  counted  as  residents  of  the  area  in  which  the 
installation  was  located,  either  on  the  installation  or  in  the 
surrounding  community.  Family  members  of  Armed  Forces 
personnel  were  counted  where  they  were  living  on  Census 
Day  (for  example,  with  the  Armed  Forces  person  or  at 
another  location). 

Each  Navy  ship  not  deployed  to  the  6th  or  7th  Fleet  was 
attributed  to  the  municipality  that  the  Department  of  the 
Navy  designated  as  its  homeport.  If  the  homeport  included 
more  than  one  municipality,  ships  berthed  there  on  Census 
Day  were  assigned  by  the  Bureau  of  the  Census  to  the 
municipality  in  which  the  land  immediately  adjacent  to  the 
dock  or  pier  was  actually  located.  Ships  attributed  to  the 
homeport,  but  not  physically  present  and  not  deployed  to 
the  6th  or  7th  Fleet,  were  assigned  to  the  municipality 
named  on  the  Department  of  the  Navy's  homeport  list. 
These  rules  also  apply  to  Coast  Guard  vessels. 

Personnel  assigned  to  each  Navy  and  Coast  Guard  ship 
were  given  the  opportunity  to  report  a  residence  off  the 
ship.  Those  who  did  report  an  off-ship  residence  in  the 
communities  surrounding  the  homeport  were  counted  there; 
those  who  did  not  were  counted  as  residents  of  the  ship. 
Personnel  on  Navy  ships  deployed  to  the  6th  or  7th  Fleet 
on  Census  Day  were  considered  to  be  part  of  the  overseas 
population. 


COLLECTION  AND  PROCESSING  PROCEDURES 


D-1 


Persons  on  Maritime  Ships— Persons  aboard  maritime 
ships  who  reported  an  off-ship  residence  were  counted  at 
that  residence.  Those  who  did  not  were  counted  as 
residents  of  the  ship,  and  were  attributed  as  follows: 

1 .  The  port  where  the  ship  was  docked  on  Census  Day, 
if  that  port  was  in  the  United  States  or  its  territories. 

2.  The  port  of  departure  if  the  ship  was  at  sea,  provided 
the  port  was  in  the  United  States  or  its  territories. 

3.  The  port  of  destination  in  the  United  States  or  its 
territories,  if  the  port  of  departure  of  a  ship  at  sea  was 
a  foreign  port. 

4.  The  overseas  population  if  the  ship  was  docked  at  a 
foreign  port  or  at  sea  between  foreign  ports.  (These 
persons  were  not  included  in  the  overseas  population 
for  apportionment  purposes.) 

Persons  Away  at  School— College  students  were  counted 
as  residents  of  the  area  in  which  they  were  living  while 
attending  college,  as  they  have  been  since  the  1950 
census.  Children  in  boarding  schools  below  the  college 
level  were  counted  at  their  parental  home. 

Persons  in  Institutions— Persons  under  formally  autho- 
rized, supervised  care  or  custody,  such  as  in  Federal  or 
State  prisons;  local  jails;  Federal  detention  centers;  juve- 
nile institutions;  nursing,  convalescent,  and  rest  homes  for 
the  aged  and  dependent;  or  homes,  schools,  hospitals,  or 
wards  for  the  physically  handicapped,  mentally  retarded, 
or  mentally  ill,  were  counted  at  these  places. 

Persons  Away  From  Their  Usual  Residence  on  Census 

Day— Migrant  agricultural  workers  who  did  not  report  a 
usual  residence  elsewhere  were  counted  as  residents  of 
the  place  where  they  were  on  Census  Day.  Persons  in 
worker  camps  who  did  not  report  a  usual  residence 
elsewhere  were  counted  as  residents  of  the  camp  where 
they  were  on  Census  Day. 

In  some  parts  of  the  country,  natural  disasters  displaced 
significant  numbers  of  households  from  their  usual  place  of 
residence.  If  these  persons  reported  a  destroyed  or  dam- 
aged residence  as  their  usual  residence,  they  were  counted 
at  that  location. 

Persons  away  from  their  usual  residence  were  counted 
by  means  of  interviews  with  other  members  of  their 
families,  resident  managers,  or  neighbors. 

DATA  COLLECTION  PROCEDURES 

The  1990  census  was  conducted  primarily  through 
self-enumeration.  The  questionnaire  packet  included  gen- 
eral information  about  the  1990  census  and  an  instruction 
guide  explaining  how  to  complete  the  questionnaire.  Spanish- 
language  questionnaires  and  instruction  guides  were  avail- 
able on  request.  Instruction  guides  also  were  available  in 
32  other  languages. 


Enumeration  of  Housing  Units 

Each  housing  unit  in  the  country  received  one  of  two 
versions  of  the  census  questionnaire: 

1.  A  short-form  questionnaire  that  contained  a  limited 
number  of  basic  population  and  housing  questions; 
these  questions  were  asked  of  all  persons  and  hous- 
ing units  and  are  often  referred  to  as  100-percent 
questions. 

2.  A  long-form  questionnaire  that  contained  the  100- 
percent  items  and  a  number  of  additional  questions;  a 
sampling  procedure  was  used  to  determine  those  \ 
housing   units  that  were  to   receive  the   long-form 
questionnaire. 


Three  sampling  rates  were  employed.  For  slightly  more 
than  one-half  of  the  country,  one  in  every  six  housing  units  ' 
(about  17  percent)   received  the   long-form  or  sample 
questionnaire.  In  functioning  local  governmental  units  (coun- 
ties and  incorporated  places,  and  in  some  parts  of  the  \ 
country,  towns  and  townships)  estimated  to  have  fewer ', 
than  2,500  inhabitants,  every  other  housing  unit  (50  per- ; 
cent)  received  the  sample  questionnaire  in  order  to  enhance 
the  reliability  of  the  sample  data  for  these  small  areas.  For ' 
census  tracts  and  block  numbering  areas  having  more 
than  2,000  housing  units  in  the  Census  Bureau's  address 
files,  one  in  every  eight  housing  units  (about  13  percent) 
received  a  sample  questionnaire,  providing  reliable  statis-  • 
tics  for  these  areas  while  permitting  the  Census  Bureau  to 
stay  within  a  limit  of  17.7  million  sample  questionnaires,  or 
a  one-in-six  sample,  nationwide. 

The  mail-out/mail-back  procedure  was  used  mainly  in  • 
cities,   suburban  areas,   towns,   and   rural  areas  where  ^ 
mailing  addresses  consisted  of  a  house  number  and  street  ] 
name.   In  these  areas,  the  Census  Bureau  developed 
mailing  lists  that  included  about  88.4  million  addresses. 
The  questionnaires  were  delivered  through  the  mail  and 
respondents  were  to  return  them  by  mail.  Census  ques- 
tionnaires were  delivered   1   week  before  Census  Day 
(April  1,  1990) 

The  update/leave/mail-back  method  was  used  mainly  '' 
in  densely  populated  rural  areas  where  it  was  difficult  to 
develop  mailing  lists  because  mailing  addresses  did  not 
use  house  number  and  street  name.  The  Census  Bureau  ' 
compiled  lists  of  housing  units  in  advance  of  the  census. 
Enumerators  delivered  the  questionnaires,  asked  respon- 
dents to  return  them  by  mail,  and  added  housing  units  not 
on  the  mailing  lists.  This  method  was  used  mainly  in  the 
South  and  Midwest,  and  also  included  some  high-rise, 
low-income  urban  areas.  A  variation  of  this  method  was 
used  in  urban  areas  having  large  numbers  of  boarded-up 
buildings.  About  1 1  million  housing  units  were  enumerated 
using  this  method. 

The  list/enumerate  method  (formeriy  called  conven- 
tional or  door-to-door  enumeration)  was  used  mainly  in 
very  remote  and  sparsely-settled  areas.  The  United  States 


D-2 


COLLECTION  AND  PROCESSING  PROCEDURES  •■ 


Postal  Service  delivered  unaddressed  short-form  question- 
naires before  Census  Day.  Starting  a  week  before  Census 
Day,  enumerators  canvassed  these  areas,  checked  that  all 
housing  units  received  a  questionnaire,  created  a  list  of  all 
housing  units,  completed  long-form  questionnaires,  and 
picked  up  the  completed  short-form  questionnaires.  This 
method  was  used  mainly  in  the  West  and  Northeast  to 
enumerate  an  estimated  6.5  million  housing  units. 

Followup 

Nonresponse  Followup— In  areas  where  respondents 
were  to  mail  back  their  questionnaires,  an  enumerator 
visited  each  address  from  which  a  questionnaire  was  not 
received. 

Coverage  and  Edit-Fallure  Followup— In  the  mail-back 
areas,  some  households  returned  a  questionnaire  that  did 
not  meet  specific  quality  standards  because  of  incomplete 
or  inconsistent  information,  or  the  respondent  had  indi- 
cated difficulty  in  deciding  who  was  to  be  listed  on  the 
questionnaire.  These  households  were  contacted  by  tele- 
phone or  by  personal  visit  to  obtain  the  missing  information 
or  to  clarify  who  was  to  be  enumerated  in  the  household.  In 
areas  where  an  enumerator  picked  up  the  questionnaires, 
the  enumerator  checked  the  respondent-filled  question- 
naire for  completeness  and  consistency. 

Special  Enumeration  Procedures 

Special  procedures  and  questionnaires  were  used  for 
the  enumeration  of  persons  in  group  quarters,  such  as 
college  dormitories,  nursing  homes,  prisons,  military  bar- 
racks, and  ships.  The  questionnaires  (Individual  Census 
Reports,  Military  Census  Reports,  and  Shipboard  Census 
Reports)  included  the  100-percent  population  questions 
but  did  not  include  any  housing  questions.  In  all  group 
quarters,  all  persons  were  asked  the  basic  population 
questions;  in  most  group  quarters,  additional  questions 
were  asked  of  a  sample  (one-in-six)  of  persons. 

Shelter  and  Street  Night  (S-Night) 

The  Census  Bureau  collected  data  for  various  compo- 
nents of  the  homeless  population  at  different  stages  in  the 
1990  census.  "Shelter  and  Street  Night"  (S-Night)  was  a 
special  census  operation  to  count  the  population  in  four 
types  of  locations  where  homeless  people  are  found.  On 
the  evening  of  March  20,  1990,  and  during  the  early 
morning  hours  of  March  21,  1990,  enumerators  counted 
persons  in  pre-identified  locations: 

1 .  Emergency  shelters  for  the  homeless  population  (pub- 
lic and  private;  permanent  and  temporary). 

2.  Shelters  with  temporary  lodging  for  runaway  youths. 

3.  Shelters  for  abused  women  and  their  children. 


4.  Open  locations  in  streets  or  other  places  not  intended 
for  habitation. 

Emergency  shelters  include  all  hotels  and  motels  cost- 
ing $12  or  less  (excluding  taxes)  per  night  regardless  of 
whether  persons  living  there  considered  themselves  to  be 
homeless,  hotels  and  motels  (regardless  of  cost)  used 
entirely  to  shelter  homeless  persons,  and  pre-identified 
rooms  in  hotels  and  motels  used  for  homeless  persons 
and  families.  Enumeration  in  shelters  usually  occurred 
from  6  p.m.  to  midnight;  street  enumeration,  from  2  a.m.  to 
4  a.m.;  abandoned  and  boarded-up  buildings  from  4  a.m.  to 
8  a.m.;  and  shelters  for  abused  women,  from  6  p.m.  on 
March  20  to  noon  on  March  21. 

Other  components,  which  some  consider  as  part  of  the 
homeless  population,  were  enumerated  as  part  of  regular 
census  operations.  These  include  persons  doubled  up  with 
other  families,  as  well  as  persons  with  no  other  usual  home 
living  in  transient  sites,  such  as  commercial  campgrounds, 
maternity  homes  for  unwed  mothers,  and  drug/alcohol 
abuse  detoxification  centers.  In  institutions,  such  as  local 
jails  and  mental  hospitals,  the  Census  Bureau  does  not 
know  who  has  a  usual  home  elsewhere;  therefore,  even 
though  some  are  literally  homeless,  these  persons  cannot 
be  identified  separately  as  a  component  of  the  homeless 
population. 

There  is  no  generally  agreed-upon  definition  of  "the 
homeless,"  and  there  are  limitations  in  the  census  count 
that  prevent  obtaining  a  total  count  of  the  homeless 
population  under  any  definition.  As  such,  the  Census 
Bureau  does  not  have  a  definition  and  will  not  provide  a 
total  count  of  "the  homeless."  Rather,  the  Census  Bureau 
will  provide  counts  and  characteristics  of  persons  found  at 
the  time  of  the  census  in  selected  types  of  living  arrange- 
ments. These  selected  components  can  be  used  as  build- 
ing blocks  to  construct  a  count  of  homeless  persons 
appropriate  to  particular  purposes  as  long  as  the  data 
limitations  are  taken  into  account. 

In  preparation  for  "Shelter-and-Street-Night"  enumera- 
tion, the  regional  census  centers  (RCC's)  mailed  a  certified 
letter  (Form  D-33  (L))  to  the  highest  elected  official  of  each 
active  functioning  government  of  the  United  States  (more 
than  39,000)  requesting  them  to  identify: 

1.  All  shelters  with  sleeping  facilities  (permanent  and 
temporary,  such  as  church  basements,  armories, 
public  buildings,  and  so  forth,  that  could  be  open  on 
March  20). 

2.  Hotels  and  motels  used  to  house  homeless  persons 
and  families. 

3.  A  list  of  outdoor  locations  where  homeless  persons 
tend  to  be  at  night. 

4.  Places  such  as  bus  or  train  stations,  subway  stations, 
airports,  hospital  emergency  rooms,  and  so  forth, 
where  homeless  persons  seek  shelter  at  nfght.

5.  The  specific  addresses  of  abandoned  or  boarded-up 
buildings  where  homeless  persons  were  thought  to 
stay  at  night. 

The  letter  from  the  RCC's  to  the  governmental  units 
emphasized  the  importance  of  listing  night-time  congregat- 
ing sites.  The  list  of  shelters  was  expanded  using  informa- 
tion from  administrative  records  and  informed  local  sources. 
The  street  sites  were  limited  to  the  list  provided  by  the 
jurisdictions.  All  governmental  units  were  eligible  for  "Shel- 
ter and  Street  Night."  For  cities  with  50,000  or  more 
persons,  the  Census  Bureau  took  additional  steps  to 
update  the  list  of  shelter  and  street  locations  if  the  local 
jurisdiction  did  not  respond  to  the  certified  letter.  Smaller 
cities  and  rural  areas  participated  if  the  local  jurisdiction 
provided  the  Census  Bureau  a  list  of  shelters  or  open 
public  places  to  visit  or  if  shelters  were  identified  through 
our  inventory  development,  local  knowledge  update,  or 
during  the  Special  Place  Prelist  operation. 

The  Census  Bureau  encouraged  persons  familiar  with 
homeless  persons  and  the  homeless  themselves  to  apply 
as  enumerators.  This  recruiting  effort  was  particularly 
successful  in  larger  cities. 

For  shelters,  both  long-  and  short-form  Individual  Cen- 
sus Reports  (ICR's)  were  distributed.  For  street  enumera- 
tion, only  short-form  ICR's  were  used.  Persons  in  shelters 
and  at  street  locations  were  asked  the  basic  population 
questions.  Additional  questions  about  social  and  economic 
characteristics  were  asked  of  a  sample  of  persons  in 
shelters  only. 

Enumerators  were  instructed  not  to  ask  who  was  home- 
less; rather,  they  were  told  to  count  all  persons  (including 
children)  staying  overnight  at  the  shelters,  and  everyone 
they  saw  on  the  street  except  the  police,  other  persons  in 
uniform,  and  persons  engaged  in  employment  or  obvious 
money-making  activities  other  than  begging  and  panhan- 
dling. 

At  both  shelter  and  street  sites,  persons  found  sleeping 
were  not  awakened  to  answer  questions.  Rather,  the 
enumerator  answered  the  sex  and  race  questions  by 
observation  and  estimated  the  person's  age  to  the  best  of 
his  or  her  ability.  In  shelters,  administrative  records  and 
information  from  the  shelter  operator  were  used,  when 
available,  for  persons  who  were  already  asleep. 

Less  than  1  percent  of  shelters  refused  to  participate  in 
the  census  count  at  first.  By  the  end  of  the  census  period, 
most  of  those  eventually  cooperated  and  the  number  of 
refusals  had  been  reduced  to  a  few.  For  the  final  refusals, 
head  counts  and  population  characteristics  were  obtained 
by  enumerators  standing  outside  such  shelters  and  count- 
ing people  as  they  left  in  the  morning. 

The  "street"  count  was  restricted  to  persons  who  were 
visible  when  the  enumerator  came  to  the  open,  public 
locations  that  had  been  identified  by  local  jurisdictions. 
Homeless  persons  who  were  well  hidden,  moving  about,  or 
in  locations  other  than  those  identified  by  the  local  gov- 
ernments were  likely  missed.  The  number  missed  will 
never  be  known  and  there  is  no  basis  to  make  an  estimate 


of  the  number  missed  from  census  data.  The  count  of 
persons  in  open,  public  places  was  affected  by  many 
factors,  including  the  extra  efforts  made  to  encourage 
people  to  go  to  shelters  for  "Shelter  and  Street  Night,"  the 
weather  (which  was  unusually  cold  in  many  parts  of  the 
country),  the  presence  of  the  media,  and  distrust  of  the 
census.  Expectations  of  the  number  of  homeless  persons 
on  the  street  cannot  be  based  on  the  number  seen  dunng 
the  day  because  the  night-time  situation  is  normally  very 
different  as  more  homeless  persons  are  in  shelters  or  very 
well  hidden. 

For  both  "Shelter-and-Street-Night"  locations,  the  Cen- 
sus Bureau  assumed  that  the  usual  home  of  those  enu- 
merated was  in  the  block  where  they  were  found  (shelter 
or  street). 

The  "Shelter-and-Street-Night"  operation  replaced  and 
expanded  the  1980  Mission  Night  (M-Night)  and  Casual 
Count  operations.  These  two  operations  were  aimed  at 
counting  the  population  who  reported  having  no  usual 
residence.  M-Night  was  conducted  a  week  after  Census 
Day,  in  April  1980.  Enumerators  visited  hotels,  motels,  and 
similar  places  costing  $4  or  less  each  night;  missions, 
flophouses,  local  jails  and  similar  places  at  which  the 
average  length  of  stay  was  30  days  or  less;  and  nonshelter 
locations,  such  as  bus  depots,  train  stations,  and  all  night 
movie  theaters.  Questions  were  asked  of  everyone,  regard- 
less of  age.  Enumerators  conducted  M-Night  up  to  mid- 
night on  April  8,  1980,  and  returned  the  next  morning  to 
collect  any  forms  completed  after  midnight. 

The  Casual  Count  operation  was  conducted  in  May 
1980  at  additional  nonshelter  locations,  such  as  street 
corners,  pool  halls,  welfare  and  employment  offices.  This 
operation  lasted  for  approximately  2  weeks.  Casual  Count 
was  conducted  during  the  day  only  in  selected  large 
central  cities.  Only  persons  who  appeared  to  be  at  least  1 5 
years  of  age  were  asked  if  they  had  been  previously 
enumerated.  Casual  Count  was  actually  a  coverage-improve- 
ment operation.  It  was  not  specifically  an  operation  to 
count  homeless  persons  living  in  the  streets.  Persons  were 
excluded  if  they  said  they  had  a  usual  home  outside  the 
city  because  it  was  not  cost  effective  to  check  through 
individual  questionnaires  in  another  city  to  try  to  find  the 
person. 

PROCESSING  PROCEDURES 

Respondents  returned  many  census  questionnaires  by 
mail  to  1  of  over  344  census  district  offices  or  to  one  of  six 
processing  offices.  In  these  offices,  the  questionnaires 
were  "checked  in"  and  edited  for  completeness  and 
consistency  of  the  responses.  After  this  initial  processing 
had  been  performed,  all  questionnaires  were  sent  to  the 
processing  offices. 

In  the  processing  offices,  the  household  questionnaires 
were  microfilmed  and  processed  by  the  Film  Optical 
Sensing  Device  for  Input  to  Computers  (FOSDIC).  For 
most  items  on  the  questionnaire,  the  information  supplied 


D-4 


COLLECTION  AND  PROCESSING  PROCEDURES 


by  the  respondent  was  indicated  by  filling  circles  in  prede- 
signated  positions.  FOSDIC  electronically  "read"  these 
filled  circles  from  the  nnicrofilm  copy  of  the  questionnaire 
and  transferred  the  information  to  computer  tape.  The 
computer  tape  did  not  include  individual  names,  addresses, 
or  handwritten  responses. 

The  data  processing  was  performed  in  several  stages. 
All  questionnaires  were  microfilmed,  "read"  by  FOSDIC, 
and  transferred  to  computer  disk.  Selected  written  entries 
in  the  race  question  on  both  the  short  and  long  forms  were 
keyed  from  the  microfilm  and  coded  using  the  data  base 
developed  from  the  1980  census  and  subsequent  content 
and  operational  tests.  Keying  of  other  written  entries  on 
the  long  forms  occurred  in  the  seven  processing  offices. 


The  information  (for  example,  income  dollar  amounts  or 
homeowner  shelter  costs)  on  these  keyed  files  was  merged 
with  the  FOSDIC  data  or  processed  further  through  one  of 
three  automated  coding  programs.  The  codes  for  industry, 
occupation,  place-of-birth,  migration,  place-of-work,  ances- 
try, language,  relationship,  race,  and  Hispanic  origin  were 
merged  with  the  FOSDIC  data  for  editing,  weighting,  and 
tabulating  operations  at  Census  Bureau  headquarters.  All 
responses  to  the  questions  on  Individual  Census  Reports 
(ICR's),  Military  Census  Reports  (MCR's),  and  Shipboard 
Census  Reports  (SCR's)  were  keyed,  not  processed  by 
microfilm  or  FOSDIC.

How  to  Fill  Out  Your  Census  Form 

Please  use  a  black  lead  pencil  only.  Black  lead  pencil  Is  better  to  use  than  ballpoint  or 
other  pens.  Most  questions  ask  you  to  fillin  the  drdc,  or  to  print  the  information.  Sec 
Emnple  below. 


Make  sure  you  print  answers  for  everyone  in  this  househoM.  If  someone  in  the 
househokl,  such  as  a  roomer  or  boarder,  does  not  want  to  give  you  all  the 
information  for  the  form,  print  at  least  Ae  person's  name  and  answer  questions  2 
and  3.  A  census  taker  will  call  to  get  the  other  informatkm  direcdy  from  the  person. 


There  may  be  a  questton  you  cannot  answer  exactly.  For  example,  you  might  not 
know  the  age  of  an  elderly  person  OT  the  price  for  whk:h  your  house  wouM  seD.  Ask 
someone  else  in  your  househokl;  if  no  one  knows,  ^e  your  best  estimate. 


Instructions  for  individual  questions  begin  on  page  3  of  this  guide .  They  will  help  you 
to  understand  the  questions  and  answer  them  correctly. 

If  you  have  a  question  about  filling  out  the  census  form  or  need  asdstance,  caD  the 
local  U.S.  census  office.  The  telephone  nnmber  to  given  on  the  cover  of  the 
qnettionnaire. 


If  you  do  not  mail  back  your  census  form,  a  census  taker  will  be  sent  out  to  assist  you. 
But  it  saves  time  and  your  taxpayer  dollars  if  you  fill  out  the  form  yourself  and  mail  it 
back.

Your  Answers  Are  Confidential 

The  law  authorizing  the  census  (Title  13,  U.S.  Code)  also  provides  that  your 
answers  are  confidential.  No  one  except  census  workers  may  see  your  completed 
form  and  they  can  be  fined  and/or  imprisoned  for  any  disclosure  of  your  answers. 
Only  after  72  years  can  your  individuid  census  form  become  available  to  other 
government  agencies  (whether federal,  state,  county,  or  local).  Until  dten,  no  other 
person  or  business  can  see  your  individual  rqxvt. 

The  same  law  that  protects  the  confidentiafity  of  your  answers  requires  that  you 
provkle  the  information  asked  in  this  census  to  the  best  of  your  knowledge. 

Information  collected  from  the  decennial  census  is  used  for  a  variety  of  statistical 
purposes.  Census  information  is  used  to  find  out  where  hinding  Is  most  needoi  for 
schoob,  health  centers,  highways,  and  other  services.  Census  results  are  used  by 
members  of  publk:  and  private  groups-including  community  organizations-and  by 
businesses  and  industries,  as  well  as  by  agendes  at  all  levels  of  government.

What  the  Census  Is  About  ~ 

Some  Questions  and  Answers 

Why  are  we  taking  a  <:en8tt8? 

The  most  important  reason  for  taking  a  decennied  census  Is  to  determine  how 
many  representatives  each  state  will  have  in  Congress. 

What  does  the  Census  Bureau  do  with  the  information  yon  provide? 

The  individual  information  collected  in  the  census  is  group>ed  together  into 
statisticsd  totals.  Information  such  eis  the  number  of  persons  in  a  given  area, 
their  ages,  educational  background,  the  chairacteristics  of  their  houdng,  etc. , 
enable  government,  business,  and  industry  to  plan  more  effectively. 

How  long  have  we  been  taking  the  census? 

The  first  census  weis  taken  in  1790  in  accordance  with  the  requirement  in  the 
first  article  of  the  constitution.  A  census  has  been  taken  every  10  years  since. 
The  1990  Decennizd  Census  marks  the  200th  anniversary  of  the  census. 

How  are  you  being  counted? 

Census  forms  are  delivered  to  all  households  a  few  days  before  census  day. 
Households  eire  requested  to  fill  out  the  form  zund  mziil  it  back  to  the  census 
office. 


Why  the  Census  Asks 
Certain  Questions 

Here  are  a  few  reasons  for  asking  some  of  the  questions. 

It  is  ets  important  to  get  information  about  people  and  their  houses  as  it  is 
to  count  them. 

Name? 

Names  help  make  sure  that  everyone  in  a  household  is  coimted,  but  that 
no  one  is  counted  twice. 

Value  or  rent? 

Government  and  planning  agencies  use  answers  to  these  questions  in 
combination  with  other  information  to  develop  housing  programs  to 
meet  the  needs  of  people  at  different  economic  levels. 

Complete  plumbing? 

This  question  gives  information  on  the  quality  of  housing.  The  data  eure 
used  with  other  statistics  to  show  how  the  "level  of  living"  compares  in 
veirious  areas  and  how  it  has  changed  over  time. 

Place  of  birth? 

This  question  provides  information  used  to  study  long-term  trends  as  to 
where  people  move  and  to  study  migration  patterns  and  differences  in 
growth  patterns. 

Job? 

Answers  to  the  questions  about  the  jobs  people  hold  provide  information 
on  the  extent  and  types  of  employment  in  dtfferent  areeis  of  the  country. 
From  this  information,  training  programs  can  be  developed  and  the  need 
for  new  industries  can  be  determined. 

Income? 

Income,  more  th<»n  anything  else,  determines  how  families  or  persons 
live.  Income  information  makes  it  possible  to  compare  the  economic 
levels  of  different  areas.

ple, the  State  Data  Center  Program  has  been  expanded  to 
include  over  1,400  organizations  to  provide  data  and 
services  to  the  public. 

This  appendix  provides  a  detailed  introduction  to  the 
1 990  census  data  products  and  related  materials,  such  as 
maps  and  reference  publications.  It  concludes  by  describ- 
ing sources  of  assistance  and  other  Census  Bureau  data 
available  to  the  public. 

DATA  PRODUCTS 

Printed  reports  and  computer  tape  files  traditionally  are 
the  most  widely  used  products.  The  Census  Bureau  also 
offers  data  on  microfiche,  on  CD-ROM  laser  discs,  and 
through  its  online  service,  CENDATA"^'^.  These  various 
products  are  described  below.  For  information  about  prices 
and  how  to  order,  write  or  call  Customer  Services.  (See  the 
"Sources  of  Assistance"  section  for  the  address  and 
phone  number.) 

The  data  products  present  statistics  about  the  subjects 
covered  in  the  1990  census  questionnaires.  These  sub- 
jects are  listed  in  figure  1 ,  page  F-7.  As  the  figure  shows, 
there  are  100-percent  subjects  (those  covered  in  ques- 
tions asked  of  everyone  or  about  every  housing  unit)  and 
sample  subjects  (those  covered  in  questions  asked  at 
about  one  out  of  every  six  housing  units).  Generally,  a  data 
product  presents  either  100-percent  data  prepared  by 
tabulating  the  responses  to  the  100-percent  questions 
from  all  questionnaires,  or  sample  data  prepared  by  tabu- 
lating only  the  responses  to  the  100-percent  and  sample 
questions  from  the  "long-form"  questionnaires.  Two  report 
series,  1990  CPH-3  and  1990  CPH-4  (see  figure  2,  page 
F-8),  present  both  100-percent  and  sample  data. 


Printed  Reports 

Printed  reports  are  the  most  convenient  and  readily 
available  source  of  data  for  most  census  users.  The 
Census  Bureau  releases  the  reports  in  several  series  (see 
figure  2)  that  are  grouped  under  three  broad  titles:  1990 
Census  of  Population  and  Housing  (1990  CPH),  1990 
Census  of  Population  (1990  CP),  and  1990  Census  of 
Housing  (1 990  CH).  There  also  are  reports,  not  reflected  in 
figure  2,  for  the  outlying  areas  of  the  Pacific.  The  reports 
are  sold  by  the  Superintendent  of  Documents,  U.S.  Gov- 
ernment Printing  Office.  (See  the  "Sources  of  Assistance" 
section  for  the  address  and  phone  number.) 

In  several  series,  there  are  separate  reports  for  each 
State.  The  geographic  coverage  of  the  State  reports  is 
listed  in  figure  2.  The  United  States  summaries  for  these 
report  series  contain,  for  the  most  part,  data  for  the  United 
States,  regions,  divisions.  States,  metropolitan  areas  (MA's), 
urbanized  areas  (UA's),  counties,  American  Indian  and 
Alaska  Native  areas,  places  with  10,000  or  more  persons, 
and  other  large  substate  areas  (for  example,  county  sub- 
divisions, such  as  towns  and  townships,  with  10,000  or 
more  persons  in  selected  States). 

Report  series  that  present  data  for  small  areas,  such  as 
census  tracts,  contain  limited  subject-matter  detail  (for 
example,  counts  of  people  by  age  ranges — under  5  years, 
5  to  9  years,  etc. — rather  than  by  single  years).  Report 
series  that  include  greater  amounts  of  subject-matter  detail 
include  less  geographic  detail. 

Computer  Tape  Files 

The  Census  Bureau  provides  more  data  on  tape  and 
other  machine-readable  products  than  in  printed  reports. 
These  products  are  sold  by  the  Census  Bureau's  Cus- 
tomer Services.  There  are  several  general  types  of  data 
files  released  on  computer  tape  (available  on  both  reels 
and  cartridges).  They  are  introduced  below,  and  more 
information  is  presented  in  figures  3  and  4,  pages  F-11 
through  F-1 3. 

Public  Law  94-171  Data— This  data  file  presents  the 
counts  designed  and  formatted  for  use  in  legislative  re- 
districting.  These  counts  also  are  available  on  CD-ROM 
and  paper  listings.  Excerpts  are  available  on 
CENDATA™.  The  counts,  for  areas  as  small  as  blocks, 
census  tracts,  and  voting  districts,  include  totals  for  popu- 
lation, race  groups,  persons  of  Hispanic  origin,  population 
18  years  and  over,  and  housing  units.  (See  figure  4.) 


DATA  PRODUCTS  AND  USER  ASSISTANCE

Summary  Tape  Files  (STF's)—  These  computer  tape  files 
provide  statistics  with  greater  subject-matter  detail  than 
printed  reports.  They  also  present  statistics  for  some  types 
of  areas,  such  as  block  groups  and  blocks,  that  are  not 
included  in  the  reports.  (See  figure  3.) 

Here  are  some  important  features  of  STF's: 

•  Each  STF  presents  a  particular  set  of  data  tables  for 
specific  types  of  geographic  areas. 

•  Each  STF  has  three  or  more  file  types  (indicated  by  a 
letter  suffix  attached  to  the  STF  number)  that  differ  in  the 
geographic  levels  reported,  but  contain  the  same  data 
detail. 

•  STF's  1  and  2  contain  100-percent  data,  and  STF's  3 
and  4  offer  sample  data. 

•  STF's  1  and  3  report  on  smaller  areas  and  offer  less 
data  detail  than  STF's  2  and  4. 

•  STF's  1  through  4  offer  greater  data  detail  than  the  1 980 
STF's  1  through  4. 

Subject  Summary  Tape  Files  (SSTF's)— These  files  are 
the  source  of  the  subject  reports  and  provide  greater 
subject-matter  detail  than  the  STF's.  They  present  data  for 
the  United  States,  regions,  and  divisions,  and,  in  some 
cases,  also  for  States,  counties,  and  large  cities.  (See 
figure  4.) 

Public  Use  Microdata  Sample  (PUMS)  Files— These 
computer  tape  files  (see  figure  4)  contain  data  from 
samples  of  long-form  housing-unit  records  ("micro- 
data")  for  large  geographic  areas.  Each  sample  housing- 
unit  record  includes  essentially  all  the  1990  census  data 
collected  about  each  person  in  a  sample  household  and 
the  characteristics  of  the  housing  unit.  Information  that 
could  be  used  to  identify  an  individual  or  a  housing  unit  is 
not  included  in  the  file. 

Microdata  files  enable  users  to  prepare  customized 
tabulations  and  cross-tabulations  of  most  items  on  the 
census  questionnaire.  There  are  two  PUMS  files: 

•  A  file  presenting  a  5-percent  sample  of  housing  units  in 
which  each  household  record  includes  codes  to  let  the 
user  know  in  what  area,  such  as  a  group  of  counties,  a 
single  county,  or  a  place,  the  household  is  located.  Each 
area  identified  must  have  a  population  of  at  least  1 00,000 
and  boundaries  that  do  not  cross  State  lines. 

•  A  file  presenting  a  1  -percent  sample  of  housing  units.  Its 
household  records  include  codes  associating  them  with 
MA'S  and  other  large  areas,  the  boundaries  of  which 
may  cross  State  lines.  (For  the  1980  census,  there  were 
two  files  with  1 -percent  samples.  The  1 -percent  sample 
showing  data  for  selected  urbanized  areas  and  other 
large  areas  will  not  be  produced  for  the  1 990  census.) 

Other  Special  Computer  Tape  Files— Other  files  include 
the  Census/Equal  Employment  Opportunity  (EEO)  Special 
File  and  the  County-to-County  Migration  File.  (See  figure 
4.)  The  Census  Bureau  may  prepare  additional  special 
files.

Microfiche 

Block  statistics  are  available  on  microfiche  as  they  were 
for  the  1 980  census.  The  microfiche  present,  in  table : 
format,  a  subset  of  the  tabulations  for  census  blocks  found 
in  STF  IB  (see  figure  3).  In  the  1990  census,  for  the  first  j 
time,  the  entire  land  area  of  the  Nation  and  its  possessions  , 
was  block-numbered.  This  increased  the  number  of  blocks 
for  which  the  Census  Bureau  provides  data  from  2.5  million 
in  1 980  to  7  million  for  1 990.  The  cost  and  storage  of  block  -. 
data  of  this  magnitude  would  be  prohibitive  if  the  data  were 
published  in  printed  reports. 

STF's  1 A  and  3A  are  available  on  microfiche,  as  well.  As 
noted   in   figure  3,   they  provide   data  for  a  variety  of 
geographic  areas.  Also,  all  printed  reports  are  offered  on 
microfiche  from  Customer  Services  soon  after  they  are  5 
published. 

Compact  Disc— Read-Only  Memory  (CD-ROM) 

For  the  1990  census,  the  Public  Law  (P.L)  94-171  file; 
an  extract  of  STF  1 B  that  presents  selected  statistics  for 
blocks;  and  STF's  1A,  1C,  3A,  3B,  and  3C  are  also 
available  on  CD-ROM.  (One  4  3/4-inch  CD-ROM,  a  type  of 
optical  or  laser  disc,  can  hold  the  contents  of  approxi- 
mately 1,600  flexible  diskettes,  or  three  or  four  high- 
density  computer  tapes.) 

Online  Information  Systems 

The  Census  Bureau  began  CENDATA^"^,  its  online 
information  service,  in  1984.  CENDATA^*^  is  accessible 
through  two  information  vendors,  CompuServe  and 
DIALOG.  A  number  of  Census  Bureau  reports,  in  whole 
or  in  part,  are  offered  online.  For  the  1990  census, 
CENDATA^*^  provides  up-to-date  information  about  the 
availability  of  data  products  and  carries  selections  of  State, 
county,  MA,  and  place  data  from  the  P.L.  94-171  tape  file 
and  STF's  1  and  3. 

Custom  Data  Products 

These  products  are  for  users  who  require  unique  tabu- 
lations that  are  not  included  in  standard  products;  for 
example,  information  for  locally  defined  geographic  areas. 
Users  also  can  order  special  microdata  files. 

The  cost  of  preparing  custom  products  must  be  paid  by 
the  users  who  request  them.  Any  data  that  the  Census 
Bureau  provides  in  these  products  are  subject  to  the  same 
standards  applied  to  other  data  to  ensure  that  confidential 
individual  information  is  not  revealed. 

User-Defined  Areas  Program  (UDAP)  Tabulations— 

UDAP  can  provide  a  set  of  predefined  data  tables  for 
locally  defined  areas  that  do  not  correspond  to  standard 
1990  census  geographic  areas.  Users  identify  the  geo- 
graphic areas  of  interest  to  them  by  delineating  boundanes 
around  groupings  of  census  blocks  on  1 990  census  County 

DATA  PRODUCTS  AND  USER  ASSISTANCE 


Block  Maps  or  by  electronically  submitting  the  geographic 
components  of  their  area  of  interest.  (A  contact  for  more 
information  is  given  in  the  "Sources  of  Assistance"  sec- 
tion.) 

Special  Tabulations— The  Census  Bureau  can  prepare 
special  data  tabulations  for  any  specific  geographic  or 
subject-matter  area.  Users  should  rely  on  standard  reports, 
tapes,  microfiche,  or  user-defined  area  tabulations  when- 
ever possible,  since  special  tabulations  tend  to  be  substan- 
tially more  expensive  and  take  time  to  arrange  and  pro- 
duce. (Contacts  for  more  information  are  given  in  the 
"Sources  of  Assistance"  section.) 


GEOGRAPHIC  PRODUCTS 


Maps 


Voting  District  Outline  Maps— Maps  in  this  county-based 
series  depict  voting  district  boundaries  (for  those  counties 
for  which  States  furnished  boundary  information)  and  the 
features  underlying  the  boundaries.  They  also  show  gov- 
ernmental unit  boundaries  in  relation  to  the  voting  districts. 
They  are  prepared  on  electrostatic  plotters  and  sold  by 
Customer  Services. 

Geographic  Publications 

The  Geographic  Identification  Code  Sctieme  report  in 
the  1990  CPH-R  series  shows  the  1990  census  geo- 
graphic area  codes  and  Federal  information  processing 
standards  (FIPS)  codes,  as  appropriate,  for  States,  metro- 
politan areas,  counties,  county  subdivisions,  places,  Amer- 
ican Indian  and  Alaska  Native  areas,  and  other  entities, 
along  with  some  descriptive  information  about  the  codes. 
The  code  scheme  also  is  offered  on  computer  tape. 


Census  Bureau  maps  are  necessary  for  virtually  all  uses 
of  small-area  1 990  census  data.  They  are  needed  to  locate 
the  specific  geographic  areas  for  which  the  census  pro- 
vides data  and  to  study  the  spatial  relationship  of  the  data 
for  analytic  purposes.  The  Census  Bureau  prepares  a 
variety  of  1990  census  maps.  Among  the  most  useful  are 
these  four  series: 

County  Block  Maps — These  maps  show  census  blocks 
and  their  numbers;  boundaries  for  statistical  and  govern- 
mental entities,  such  as  census  tracts  and  places;  and 
physical  features.  The  P.L.  94-171  version  of  these  maps 
also  shows  voting  district  boundaries  in  those  States  that 
furnished  them.  The  maps  are  prepared  on  electrostatic 
plotters  by  county  (or  equivalent  entity)  with  one  or  more 
map  sheets  each,  depending  on  the  size  and  shape  of  the 
area  and  the  density  of  the  block  pattern.  An  average 
county  requires  20  map  sheets.  The  maps  may  be  pur- 
chased from  Customer  Services. 

County  Subdivision  Outline  Maps— Maps  in  this  State- 
based  series  present  the  boundaries  of  the  counties, 
county  subdivisions,  places,  American  Indian  and  Alaska 
Native  areas  (including  off-reservation  trust  lands),  tribal 
designated  statistical  areas,  and  tribal  jurisdiction  statisti- 
cal areas.  Electrostatic-plotter  copies  are  available  for 
purchase  from  Customer  Services.  Also,  they  appear  on 
multiple  page-size  sheets  in  the  State  reports  of  these 
series:  1 990  CPH-1 , 1 990  CPH-2,  1 990  CPH-5, 1 990  CP-1 , 
1990  CP-2,  1990  CH-1,  and  1990  CH-2. 

Census  Tract/Block  Numbering  Area  (BNA)  Outline 

Maps— Maps  in  this  county-based  series  depict  census 
tract  or  BNA  boundaries  and  numbers,  and  the  features 
underlying  the  boundaries.  They  also  show  governmental 
units  in  relation  to  the  census  tracts/BNA's.  Customer 
Services  sells  electrostatic-plotter  copies,  and  the  Super- 
intendent of  Documents  sells  printed  copies. 

DATA  PRODUCTS  AND  USER  ASSISTANCE 


Machine-Readable  Geographic  Files 

All  1990  census  summary  tape  files  include  1990  cen- 
sus geographic  area  codes,  FIPS  codes,  certain  area 
names,  land  and  inland  water  area  in  square  kilometers, 
geographic  coordinates  for  an  internal  point  for  each 
entity,  and  other  geographic  information. 

The  Census  Bureau  developed  an  automated  geo- 
graphic data  base,  known  as  the  TIGER  (Topologically 
Integrated  Geographic  Encoding  and  Referencing)  Sys- 
tem, to  produce  the  geographic  products  for  the  1990 
census.  TIGER  provides  coordinate-based  digital  map 
information  for  the  entire  United  States,  Puerto  Rico,  the 
U.S.  Virgin  Islands,  and  the  Pacific  territories  over  which 
the  United  States  has  jurisdiction. 

The  TIGER  System  has  significantly  improved  the  utility 
of  1 990  census  maps  and  geographic  reference  products. 
Extract  files  generated  from  the  TIGER  System  permit 
users,  with  appropriate  software,  to  perform  such  tasks  as 
linking  the  statistical  data  in  the  P.L.  94-171  file  or  the 
STF's  and  displaying  selected  characteristics  on  maps  or  a 
video  display  screen  at  different  scales  and  with  whatever 
boundaries  they  select  for  any  geographic  area  of  the 
country.  For  example,  a  map  for  a  particular  county  could 
show  the  distribution  of  the  voting  age  population  by  city 
block. 

The  first  extract  of  selected  geographic  and  carto- 
graphic information  intended  for  computer  applications, 
such  as  plotting  maps  and  building  geographic  information 
systems,  is  called  the  TIGER/Line™  files.  TIGER/Line™ 
files  contain  attributes  for  the  segments  of  each  boundary 
and  feature  (for  example,  roads,  railroads,  and  rivers), 
including  1990  census  geographic  codes  for  adjacent 
areas,  latitude/longitude  coordinates  of  segment  end  points 
and  the  curvature  of  segments,  the  name  and  type  of  the 
feature,  and  the  relevant  census  feature  class  code  iden- 
tifying the  feature  segment  by  category.  TIGER/Line'^'^ 
files  also  furnish  address  ranges  and  associated  ZIP

TIGER/Line™  files  and  other  TIGER  System  extracts, 
such  as  TIGER/Boundary™  and  TIGER/DataBase™,  are 
released  on  computer  tape  and,  in  some  cases,  CD-ROM.

Other  Sources  of  Products  and  Services 

State  Data  Centers— The  Census  Bureau  furnishes  data 
products,  training  in  data  access  and  use,  technical  assis- 
tance, and  consultation  to  all  States,  the  District  of  Colum- 
bia, Guam,  Puerto  Rico,  and  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands.  State 
Data  Centers,  in  turn,  offer  publications  for  reference, 
printouts  from  computer  tape,  specially  prepared  reports, 
maps,  and  other  products  and  assistance  to  data  users. 
For  a  list  of  the  State  Data  Centers,  see  the  Census 
Catalog  and  Guide  or  contact  Customer  Services.  The  list 
also  notes  organizations  in  States  participating  in  the 
Census  Bureau's  Business/Industry  Data  Center  (BIDC) 
Program.  The  BIDC's  help  business  people,  economic 
development  planners,  and  other  data  users  obtain  and 
use  data. 

National  Services  Program— The  National  Services  Pro- 
gram (NSP)  provides  data-related  services  for  nationally 
based  nonprofit  organizations  that  represent  minorities  or 
other  segments  of  the  population  who  have  been  histori- 
cally undercounted  in  decennial  censuses.  The  partici- 
pants include  social  service,  business,  professional,  civil 
rights,  educational,  and  religious  groups.  Through  a  pilot 
project,  the  National  Services  Information  Center  (NSIC) 
Initiative,  three  of  these  nonprofit  groups  now  offer  their 
clientele  reports,  computer  tape  printouts,  and  other  infor- 
mation from  the  Census  Bureau.  To  learn  more  about  the 
NSP  and  the  NSIC,  write  to  the  National  Services  Program, 
Data  User  Services  Division,  Bureau  of  the  Census,  Wash- 
ington, DC  20233,  or  call  301-763-1384. 

National  Clearinghouse— The  National  Clearinghouse  for 
Census  Data  Services  is  a  listing  of  private  companies  and 
other  organizations  that  offer  assistance  in  obtaining  and 


using  data  released  by  the  Census  Bureau.  For  a  list  of 
participants  in  the  National  Clearinghouse,  see  the  Census 
Catalog  and  Guide  or  contact  Customer  Services. 

Depository  Libraries— There  are  1 ,400  libraries  that  receive 
(from  the  Government  Printing  Office)  Federal  publications 
that  they  think  their  patrons  will  need.  Often  some  of  these 
publications  are  Census  Bureau  reports.  The  Census  Bureau 
provides  free  reports  to  an  additional  120  census  deposi- 
tory libraries.  Also,  many  libraries  purchase  census  reports 
and  maps  for  their  areas.  The  Census  Catalog  and  Guide 
includes  a  list  of  all  depository  libraries. 

OTHER  CENSUS  BUREAU  RESOURCES 

The  Census  Bureau  has  more  to  offer  than  just  the 
results  of  the  census  of  population  and  housing.  Through 
other  censuses,  surveys,  and  estimates  programs,  it  com- 
piles and  issues  (in  reports,  computer  tape,  and  other 
media)  data  on  subjects  as  diverse  as  appliance  sales, 
neighborhood  conditions,  and  exports  to  other  countries. 
Here  are  examples  of  the  information  published  about— 

•  People:  Age,  race,  sex,  income,  poverty,  child  care, 
child  support,  fertility,  noncash  benefits,  education,  com- 
muting habits,  pension  coverage,  unemployment,  ances- 
try. 

•  Business  and  industry:  Number  of  employees,  total  pay- 
roll, sales  and  receipts,  products  manufactured  or  sold. 

•  Housing  and  construction:  Value  of  new  construction, 
numbers  of  owners  and  renters,  property  value  or  rent 
paid,  housing  starts,  fuels  used,  mortgage  costs. 

•  Farms:  Number,  acreage,  livestock,  crop  sales. 

•  Governments:  Revenues  and  expenditures,  taxes,  employ- 
ment, pension  funds. 

•  Foreign  trade:  Exports  and  imports,  origin  and  destina- 
tion, units  shipped. 

•  Other  nations:  Population,  birth  rates,  death  rates,  liter- 
acy, fertility. 

The  other  censuses,  such  as  agriculture,  retail  trade, 
manufactures,  and  governments,  are  collected  for  years 
ending  in  "2"  and  "7."  Surveys  and  estimates  programs 
generate  results  as  often  as  every  month. 

Many  of  the  monthly  "economic  indicators"  that  mea- 
sure how  the  Nation  is  doing  come  directly  or  indirectly 
from  the  Census  Bureau.  Examples:  employment  and 
unemployment;  housing  starts;  wholesale  and  retail  trade; 
manufacturers'  shipments,  inventories,  and  orders;  export 
and  import  trade;  and  sales  of  single-family  homes. 

The  other  statistical  activities  of  the  Census  Bureau  are 
described  below.  Data  users  will  find  more  information 
about  them  and  descriptions  of  their  data  products  in  the

annual  Census  Catalog  and  Guide.  Also,  special  guides 
and  brochures  are  prepared  for  most  of  thenn.  Contact  the 
Census  Bureau's  Customer  Services  for  more  information. 

Current  Demographic  and  Housing  Programs 

Two  types  of  current  programs  complement  the  10-year 
census:  population  estimates  and  surveys.  The  total  pop- 
ulation of  the  United  States  is  estimated  monthly;  the 
population  of  States,  counties,  and  metropolitan  areas  is 
estimated  annually;  and  the  population  of  places  and  other 
governmental  units  is  estimated  every  2  years.  Projections 
of  future  population  are  made  at  the  national  and  State 
levels. 

The  Census  Bureau's  many  household  surveys  update 
population  and  housing  characteristics  at  the  national  level 
and  sometimes  for  States  and  metropolitan  areas,  as  well. 
These  surveys  also  obtain  many  characteristics  not  included 
in  the  10-year  census.  The  Current  Population  Survey  is 
taken  monthly;  the  American  Housing  Survey  national 
sample  is  taken  biennially;  the  American  Housing  Survey 
metropolitan  sample  is  taken  in  44  areas,  1 1  per  year  in  a 
4-year  cycle;  most  other  surveys  are  annual  or  less  fre- 
quent. 

Economic  Censuses  and  Surveys 

The  economic  censuses  provide  statistics  about  busi- 
ness establishments  once  every  5  years,  covering  years 
ending  in  "2"  and  "7."  The  1987  Economic  Censuses 
include  the  censuses  of  retail  trade,  wholesale  trade, 
service  industries,  transportation,  manufactures,  mineral 
industries,  and  construction  industries.  Also  included  are 
related  programs,  such  as  statistics  on  minority-  and 
women-owned  businesses,  enterprise  statistics,  and  cen- 
suses of  economic  activity  in  Puerto  Rico  and  some  of  the 
outlying  areas  under  U.S.  jurisdiction. 

Several  key  statistics  are  tabulated  for  all  industries 
covered  in  the  censuses.  They  are  number  of  establish- 
ments, number  of  employees,  payroll,  and  measure  of 
output  (sales  or  receipts,  and  value  of  shipments  or  of  work 
done).  Other  items  vary  from  sector  to  sector. 

The  Census  Bureau  also  has  programs  that  provide 
current  statistics  on  such  measures  as  total  sales  of 
particular  kinds  of  businesses  or  production  of  particular 
products.  These  programs  include  monthly,  quarterly,  and 
annual  surveys,  the  results  of  which  appear  in  publication 
series  such  as  Current  Business  Reports  and  Current 
Industrial  Reports.  The  County  Business  Patterns  program 
offers  annual  statistics  based  on  data  compiled  primarily 
from  administrative  records. 

Agriculture  Census  and  Surveys 

The  agriculture  census  is  conducted  concurrently  with 
the  economic  censuses.  It  is  the  only  source  of  uniform 
agriculture  data  at  the  county  level.  It  provides  data  on 
such  subjects  as  the  number  and  size  of  farms;  land  use 
and  ownership;  livestock,  poultry,  and  crops;  and  value  of 
products  sold. 


F-6 


Results  of  three  surveys — the  1988  Farm  and  Ranch 
Irrigation  Survey,  1988  Census  of  Horticulture  Specialties, . 
and  1988  Agricultural  Economics  and  Land  Ownership 
Survey — are  published  in  conjunction  with  the  1987  Cen- 
sus of  Agriculture.  Also,  the  Census  Bureau  regularly 
issues  reports  from  a  survey  on  cotton  ginnings. 


Governments  Census  and  Surveys 

The  census  of  governments,  also  for  years  ending  in 
"2"  and  "7,"  covers  all  types  of  governments:  Federal, 
State,  county,  municipal  (place),  township  (county  subdivi- 
sion), school  district,  and  special  district.  It  provides  data 
on  such  subjects  as  number  of  public  employees,  payrolls,  • 
revenue,  and  expenditures. 

Annual  and  quarterly  surveys  cover  the  same  principal 
subjects  but  generate  data  only  for  States  and  the  largest 
local  governments. 


Foreign  Trade  Statistics 

Monthly  U.S.  merchandise  trade  data  compiled  by  the 
Census  Bureau  summarize  export  and  import  transactions 
and  are  based  on  the  official  documents  filed  by  shippers 
and  receivers.  These  figures  reflect  the  flow  of  merchan- 
dise but  not  intangibles  like  services  and  financial  commit- 
ments. The  trade  figures  trace  commodity  movements  out 
of  and  into  the  U.S.  Customs  jurisdiction,  which  includes 
Puerto  Rico  and  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands  as  well  as  the  50 
States  and  the  District  of  Columbia.  Data  are  published 
separately  on  trade  between  the  United  States  and  Puerto 
Rico,  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands,  and  other  U.S.  possessions. 

Other  Statistical  Activities 

The  Census  Bureau  also  offers  international  data.  It 
maintains  an  international  data  base  which  is  available  to 
the  public  on  computer  tape  and  is  used  to  produce  the 
biennial  World  Population  Profile  report.  It  prepares  studies 
dealing  with  the  demographic  and  economic  characteris- 
tics of  other  countries  and  world  regions. 

Statistical  compendia  are  another  important  data  prod- 
uct. These  publications  (sometimes  also  offered  in  machine- 
readable  form)  draw  data  from  many  sources  and  reorga- 
nize them  for  convenient  use.  The  most  widely  used 
compendia  are  the  annual  Statistical  Abstract  of  the  United 
States,  the  County  and  City  Data  Book  (published  every  5 
years),  and  the  State  and  Metropolitan  Area  Data  Book 
(published  approximately  every  4  years).

PART  B,  GLOSSARY 

1990  Census  of  Population 
and  Housing  Guide 


Part  B,  Glossary  (1990  CPH-R-IB)  is 
the  second  part  of  the  3-part  1990  Census  of  Population 
and  Housing  Guide.  It  defines  terms  used  in  the  census. 
•  Geographic  definitions  cover  specific  characteristics 
of  an  entity,  such  as  type  of  geographic  code  and  how 
boundaries  are  determined.  •  Population  and  housing 
definitions  identify  the  related  item  numbers  on  the 
1990  census  questionnaire  (included  as  an  appendix), 
define  the  concepts  involved,  and  note  the  items 
comparability  to  previous  censuses.  •  Technical 
terms  associated  with  the  collection,  processing, 
and  tabulation  of  1990  census  data  also  are  included, 
along  with  terms  used  in  working  with  data  files  on 


electronic  media.  (The  geographic,  population,  and 
housing  definitions  are  drawn  from  appendixes  to 
1990  census  reports  and  technical  documentation.)
