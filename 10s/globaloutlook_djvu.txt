Synchronicity 


e Global growth is strengthening as policy stimulus in some advanced 
economies is unwound. This is a broadly-based global expansion: all 45 
industrialised OECD and related emerging-market countries are set to 
grow this year, the first time since the Global Financial Crisis. 


e Price pressures remain muted, but signs of inflation are building in 
Canada and the US. 


e A Federal deficit of CAD 17 bn is expected this fiscal year, improving to 
CAD 16 bn by the next election. 


e Despite its recent strength, the USD is expected to weaken going 
forward, with currencies like the CAD appreciating significantly through 
the end of 2018. 


e A gradual increase in US and Canadian policy rates is expected, but the 
Canadian dollar will do some of the Bank of Canada’s work. More rapid 
rate hikes could be required if the loonie doesn't appreciate as we 
expect. 


e Geopolitical risks dominate. While there are economic risks that merit 
surveillance, potential developments in North Korea are of far greater 
concern. 


For the first time since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), all 45 industrialised 
OECD and related emerging-market countries are set to expand (chart 1). This is 
a confirmation of the narrative building throughout the year in which the sources of 
growth have been broadening across and within countries. There are now tangible 
signs that firms have joined households in contributing to the recovery in most 
countries. This is a most welcome development given the general weakness of 
business investment in companies globally since the GFC. In fact, capital 
spending in the more advanced OECD countries is expanding at a pace not seen 
in over three years (chart 2). This turnaround in investment appears to reflect a 
number of powerful factors: a rise in confidence as ISM indicators are at multi- 
year records; the still-low cost of capital; capacity constraints in some countries; 
and the general increase in trading partner activity, which is also captured by the 
acceleration in global trade growth. Given this breadth of growth geographically 
and its increasing diversity within countries, the foundation remains for solid global 
performance through at least 2018. 


A similar dynamic is at play in Canada, where all the provincial economies but 
Newfoundland and Labrador are set to expand this year. At the national level, 
growth is expected to hit an unsustainable 3.1% during 2017, roughly double 
estimates of the Canadian economy's underlying potential this year, before 
slowing to 2.0% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019 as tailwinds from Canadian consumers 
begin to flag and the economy reverts closer to its potential growth rate.

GLOBAL ECONOMICS 


| SCOTIABANK’S GLOBAL OUTLOOK 


Alberta and BC will lead the pack in 2017, with Alberta expanding by nearly 4% and 
BC by 3.5%. BC’s growth follows multiple years of higher than national average 
growth, whereas Alberta’s outperformance reflects to some degree a natural 
rebound from a very severe recession and rebuilding following the Fort McMurray 
wildfires. So while Alberta’s growth outpaces by far that of other provinces, there 
remains much excess capacity and the economy doesn't feel like it is at the 
forefront of Canadian growth. 


The sectoral breadth of the recovery in Canada also impresses. More sectors are 
expanding now than at any point since the GFC, another indication that the 
expansion is broadly based and well supported (chart 3). 


Stronger Canadian growth provides an opportunity for better fiscal outcomes. We 
anticipate that the Federal government will seek to go into the next election with an 
improving budget balance, building on the much stronger-than-expected results 
recorded this fiscal year. Our operating assumption is that the federal deficit will be 
CAD 17 bn in fiscal year 2017—18 and improve to CAD 16 bn by 2019-20, as the 
adjustment for risk remains unused. 


Hurricanes Harvey and Irma dominated US news in recent weeks, but despite the 
havoc they wrought in the southern states of the US and Puerto Rico, neither is 
expected to have a meaningful impact on overall US economic activity. US growth 
averaged just above 2% in the first half of 2017, and looks set to come in ata 
similar pace in the second half following the storms. This steady growth 
performance, with 2.2% y/y projected in 2017 and 2.3% y/y in 2018, nevertheless 
remains above both the Fed and Scotiabank Economics’ estimates of potential 
growth at around 1.8% until 2019. Strong consumption growth combined with a 
rebound in industrial activity should tip the US into excess-demand territory during 
the next couple years even if Washington proves unable to deliver on meaningful 
changes in taxes and spending. 


Growth and inflation remain largely coupled in the US and Canada. Price 
pressures are building in both countries, even though inflation remains well below 
targeted levels. In the US, a number of transitory factors are holding prices down. 
As these play out, and wage growth accelerates, inflation should gradually rise to 
2%. We continue to believe that the Fed will carry on with its gradual pace of

tightening, with a 25 bps hike in December, followed by two more hikes next year. In Canada, our empirical analysis implies 
that the link between inflation and output appears tighter than in the US. As in the US, labour market developments remain 
critical to inflation dynamics and the recent pick-up in Canadian wages suggests price increases will accelerate in the months 
ahead. This underlies our view that the Bank of Canada will raise rates gradually, with the next hike in December and two more 
during 2018. In both countries, longer-term interest rates will rise as the Fed’s balance-sheet unwind proceeds and short-term 
rates are ratcheted up, but the continuation of quantitative easing programs in Europe and Japan will limit the extent to which 


US, and therefore Canadian, longer-term rates will increase. 


At this point, we think there are upside risks to the Canadian interest rate forecast relative to the US rate view. The tighter link 
between output and prices north of the border could lead to greater inflation surprises in Canada compared with the US, 
suggesting the Canadian dollar could appreciate over the next year. Our models suggest a fair value of about 83 cents for the CAD 
based on our forecast of variables that influence the dollar, but we expect markets to overshoot this level as loonie-supportive 
sentiment returns. If the Canadian dollar remains at current levels, the Bank of Canada would need to tighten policy further, with

potentially 25-50 bps in additional tightening by early 
2019 relative to our current forecast. 


Political developments remain salient in the Pacific 
Alliance countries. Elections in Chile, Colombia, and 
Mexico, as well as political turmoil in Peru, imply some 
risks to the outlook, but we expect growth to strengthen 
significantly in 2018 as uncertainty diminishes, private and 
public investment picks up, and the region continues to 
benefit from strength in the world’s major economies, 
which leads to greater demand for commodities and other 
major emerging-market exports. 


The synchronized nature of the ongoing recovery bodes 
well for its sustainability. Concerns remain about the 
potential impact of the Fed’s efforts to unwind its balance 
sheet, the prospect of additional central banks tightening 
monetary policy, and national worries such as the level of 
household indebtedness in Canada. These risks are 
reasonably well balanced by, amongst other things, the 
possibility that asset prices could remain elevated, 
confidence could improve further, and investment could 
accelerate more rapidly than currently projected. 
Importantly, we do not build into our forecasts any impact 
from potential tax reform in the US. In our view, the most

e Growth is expected to hit 3.1% during 2017, more than double most 
estimates of the Canadian economy’s underlying potential this year, 
before slowing to 2.0% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019 as tailwinds from busy 
Canadian consumers begin to wane. 


e Investment, industrial activity, and exports are beginning to bear more 
of the burden of growth, setting the stage for a more sustainable and 
balanced outlook. 


e Despite consistent year-on-year increases in debt, Canadian 
households have seen even stronger increases in asset values, which 
position them to weather progressively rising interest rates given their 
relatively high equity in their homes. 


BROADENING GROWTH, RISING POTENTIAL 


The Canadian economy roared ahead in the first half of 2017, expanding well 
above potential at quarter-on-quarter annualized rates of 3.7% in Q1 before 
accelerating further to 4.5% in Q2. We expect momentum to continue through the 
second half (table 1) to sustain a forecast of 3.1% real GDP growth for the whole 
of 2017—up substantially from the 2.0% both we and consensus forecasts 
anticipated at the beginning of the year. Although the sources of Canadian growth 
are broadening, they still remain heavily concentrated in consumption, which is 
unlikely to be fully sustainable as interest rates rise. 


We expect Canadian growth to decelerate toward 2.0% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019 
as the effects of tighter monetary policy from the Bank of Canada take hold and 
growth returns to the economy’s underlying potential (table 2). In its April 2017 
Monetary Policy Report, the Bank proposed that potential GDP growth—the rate 
consistent with the Bank’s 2% inflation target—would range between 1.0 and 
1.6% in 2017, 1.1 and 1.7% in 2018, and 1.1 to 1.9% in 2019, for an average of 
1.4% during 2017-19. Going forward, Scotiabank Economics projects that 
potential growth will average 1.7% in 2017-19, at the upper bound of the Bank’s 
projections. We expect the Bank of Canada also to revise upward its expectations 
for potential growth to reflect improving labour productivity, increasing investment, 
and capital deepening—which would imply less excess demand (chart 1) and the 
need for only gradual further rate increases along the lines we have projected 
(table 1 again). 


These projections of Canada’s potential underlying growth rates are all still well 
below the Bank’s 2.0% estimate for the period 2010-14. After a single year of 
relatively quick growth in 2017, our expectation that growth will slow down again 
toward a middling underlying trend should prompt renewed focus on efforts to 
raise Canadian productivity once uncertainties about our trading relationship with 
the United States become resolved.

FADING CONSUMER TAILWINDS 


Consumers remain the biggest drivers of Canadian economic activity, though they 
are beginning to pass the baton of growth to other sectors of the real economy. 
Household consumption is expected to add two percentage points to Canada’s 
overall GDP advance in 2017, its largest contribution in seven years. Consumer 
confidence is at its highest level in a decade and major purchase plans remain 
elevated. 


Incomes and purchasing power have been bolstered by increased government net 
transfers and strong labour market conditions. Rapid job growth—the quickest in 
four years—has pushed the national unemployment rate to a cycle-low 6.2%, 
equivalent to 5.4% under the methodology used in the United States. The prime-age 
employment-to-population ratio is close to an all-time high of 82.3%, which implies 
that labour-market slack has been almost entirely absorbed. 


Wealth gains associated with rising home prices have provided further fuel. 
Residential real estate assets have generated CAD 236 bn in increased household 
net worth over the past year. Assuming a wealth effect of 5 cents on the dollar, this 
is likely to have added upwards of a percentage point to the annual advance in 
consumer spending. 


Several major celebrations in Canada this year, including the 150th anniversary of 
Confederation, have contributed to a notable rise in tourism-related expenditures, 
including on air and rail transportation, accommodations, food and beverage 
services, and arts and entertainment. The number of international tourists to 
Canada this year is tracking its highest level since 2006 (chart 2) as rising 
connection traffic through Canada’s international air hubs and tighter travel 
restrictions into the US provide additional support to our visitor numbers. 
Meanwhile, a Canadian dollar that has averaged below 80 US cents so far in 2017 
has limited cross-border shopping trips by Canadians to the United States (chart 2 
again). 


Consumers are unlikely to be able to maintain their recent spending momentum. 
While hiring surveys remain positive, the pace of job growth is expected to slow with 
the labour market nearing full employment in many parts of the country and 
business confidence ebbing in some sectors. More firms are reporting labour 
shortages that could limit payroll expansion. Recent and pending increases to 
minimum wages in a number of provinces also could hold back hiring. 


Several other factors are expected to reinforce a more cautious trend in consumer 
spending. The boost to incomes from the rollout of the Canada Child Benefit in mid- 
2016 has peaked, and is expected to fade over the coming year. Household disposable 
income growth is forecast to slow from 4.5% in 2017 to an average of 3.5% during 
2018-19. 


The likelihood of a further modest cooling in national home sales would dampen 
purchases of durable goods and renovation demand. Motor vehicle sales are set to 
move lower during 2018—19 after five consecutive record-breaking years that have 
driven per household purchases to record highs.

CANADA’S HOUSING CYCLE HAS LIKELY PEAKED Guns

Deteriorating housing affordability, moderately higher borrowing costs, and 

consecutive rounds of regulatory policy changes have moderated national resale 

activity. Much of the recent slowdown in sales and softening in prices has been 

concentrated in the Greater Toronto Area and surrounding municipalities, and 

follows the implementation of a series of provincial measures in the spring of 5 

2017. Activity in the region is showing tentative signs of stabilizing, which 

implies that market sentiment has now largely adjusted to these latest rule

New home construction and renovation activity remain elevated, but are expected to 
trend lower as resale-market conditions cool. Housing starts are forecast to total a five- 
year high of 212,000 units in 2017, before slowing to 198,000 and 188,000 units, 
respectively, in 2018 and 2019 (table 2 again)—even with increased demand from 
Millennials ageing into their prime household formation years and still-high international 
immigration rates. Our above-consensus forecast for 2018 takes into account the 
current elevated level of permits trending around 230,000, record pre-construction 
condo sales in Toronto, affordable housing initiatives in some provinces, and rebuilding 
in Alberta. The resulting reduction in residential investment will be felt broadly, with 
negative spillovers to a range of goods and service industries, including manufacturing, 
retail and wholesale trade, transportation, and professional services. 


PRIMARY SECTOR REVIVAL 


Industrial activity is advancing at its fastest pace in six years, led by 10.1% growth of 
volumes in the primary sector (chart 7). The volume of oil and gas extraction year-to- 
date has expanded by 22% y/y, while mining output is reviving alongside 
strengthening global demand. For example, Canadian metal export volumes have

accelerated to a 12% y/y gain in the last three months, reversing nearly two years of declining shipments. This trend is also 
evident across other metal-producing countries and reflects an upturn in business investment as global growth synchronizes. 
Capital expenditure growth among the advanced OECD economies picked up to 3.7% y/y in Q2, double the pace of the total 
annual expansion in 2016. Most of Canada’s mining exports are sent outside of North America, with less than 20% directed to 
the US. This provides a more direct perspective on strengthening global economic activity compared with data on overall 
Canadian merchandise exports since more than 70% of these merchandise exports are shipped to the United States. 


DECADE-HIGH OPERATING RATES LIFT MACHINERY DEMAND 


A broadly-based upturn is also underway for Canadian manufacturers, with industrial operating rates on the rise and a growing 
order backlog helping to lift business confidence to one of its highest levels of recent decades. Machinery and shipbuilding are 
leading the output gains, with domestic demand for manufactured products outpacing export growth for the first time in several 
years. An improving economic backdrop and rising profitability are leading a growing number of companies to increase their capital 
spending plans, resulting in a 17% y/y increase in Canadian machinery shipments to date in 2017 (chart 8).

| SCOTIABANK’S GLOBAL OUTLOOK 


The rebound in machinery demand is strongest in Alberta, with shipments to the 
primary sector year-to-date surging around 46% y/y through July. However, the 
comeback is spread across most provinces, and reflects the highest nationwide 
industrial operating rate of the past decade. Demand for industrial machinery has 
increased 25% y/y in Ontario this year to date, and is also reviving quickly in British 
Columbia. Order growth is even stronger, which is lifting the sector’s backlog to record 
highs. The machinery sector now accounts for 10% of Canada’s overall 
manufacturing backlog, roughly double its share of current shipments. 


AN EXPORT BOUNCE 


In the second quarter of the year, Canadian exports posted their best performance 
since late-2011 as nearly every major export sector recorded gains. The slight 
rebound in oil prices, with WTI oil currently trading at around USD 50, has boosted the 
value of Canada’s resource-sector exports (chart 9). While trading at nearly two times 
its early-2016 trough of USD 26, WTI oil is still selling well below its mid-2014 high of 
USD 107. At the same time, rising domestic investment has allowed capacity- 
constrained manufacturing sectors to take advantage of stronger growth across 
industrialized and emerging economies and increase their foreign sales. The third 
quarter is likely to see a brief pause in this trend owing to the temporary closure of 
some Canadian auto plants for retooling, but exports should resume their recent 
expansion as these factories come back online. 


Despite the recent boost in exports, Canada’s monthly trade deficit remains fairly high 
at just over CAD 3 bn in July, though is expected to contract towards the end of year, 
pushing the country’s current account deficit below 3% of GDP for the first time since 
2014, and continue to shrink in the coming years (table 2). Yet, with the loonie 
projected to appreciate further, firms may take advantage of the stronger currency to 
import capital goods and consumers’ extended shopping spree might get a last boost, 
which may together prevent a faster narrowing of the merchandise trade balance. 


HEAVIER RELIANCE ON FOREIGN FINANCING 


External trade deficits have to be financed, and portfolio flows into Canadian 
securities picked up from late-2015 and pushed net foreign purchases of Canadian 
assets to a year-to-date record of CAD 124 bn at end-July (chart 10). The financial 
sector’s increasing reliance on wholesale finance from abroad has driven about half of 
new Canadian corporate bond issuance this year (chart 11). 


THE CHALLENGE OF SUSTAINING A DIMINISHED FEDERAL DEFICIT 


Ottawa’s final 2016-17 deficit widened to CAD 17.8 bn from the modest one billion 
dollar shortfall in 2015-16, but this still represents a substantive improvement of more 
than CAD 5 bn compared with the original Budget estimate (excluding the CAD 6 bn 
risk adjustment) and the government’s forecast last March. Revenues were CAD 1.4 
bn higher than the government projected in March, but the CAD 3.8 bn shortfall in 
spending, due in large part to delays, was even bigger. Looking ahead, a desire to 
stabilize or even trim future budget shortfalls will make it difficult for the federal 
government to carry forward the spending delayed from fiscal 2016-17. For the 
current fiscal year, 2017-18, stronger nominal GDP growth in calendar 2017 should 
help hold the deficit around CAD 17.0 bn (excluding the adjustment for risk), albeit 
with some offset from higher-than-projected interest rates.

tripartite talks on the North American Free Trade 

Agreement (NAFTA) left Canadian negotiators still waiting to receive draft text from the US side on their proposed changes to 
major elements of the accord such as rules of origin and dispute-settlement mechanisms. These delays continue to augur for one 
of two possible outcomes: a conclusion to the talks by the end-2017 target date that results in only limited changes to the 
agreement; or, an extension of the talks beyond 2018's election season with prospects for major changes in 2019 just as 





constrained. Even if our expectation that NAFTA remains intact is realised, an elongated period of negotiations, combined with 
other potential American trade actions on softwood, steel, aluminum, solar panels, and jet aircraft, among other potential targets, 
would increase uncertainty and put a damper on both domestic and foreign direct investment into Canada. 


This potential pall on investment comes right as Canada pivots from a period of emergency monetary accommodation and 
recession-fighting fiscal stimulus to a post-crisis economic footing, where well-placed capital expenditure will be needed to raise 
estimates of our relatively low potential growth rate from 1.7%, back to pre-2008 rates closer to 2.0%. Once the uncertainty posed 
by the NAFTA talks has passed, Canada’s longer-term prosperity will hinge critically on turning our national conversation toward 
finding the right mix of private and public investment to put our economy on a sustained path toward faster long-term growth.

For provincial governments, the forecast period promises multiple layers of change. Federal policy objectives are propelling 
adjustments—from an increased focus on mental health issues and home care via the Health Accords to a renewed emphasis on 
attracting skilled immigrants to carbon pricing in all Provinces and Territories as of January 2018. Provinces and municipalities are 
struggling to make life more “affordable” for their residents, hampered in some jurisdictions by escalating power prices and in the 
future by the cost of operating and maintaining the extensive new infrastructure now under construction. Provincial economic 
development programs focused on building exports face the opportunities offered by the Comprehensive Economic and Trade 
Agreement with Europe and the uncertainties inherent in the current NAFTA renegotiations. 


In the anticipated environment of rising interest rates, the Provinces’ success post-recession in lengthening the term of their debt is 
expected to offer some insurance. But the resolution of other concerns, such as rising health care costs from an expanding Seniors 
cohort, is ongoing as new issues emerge, such as the opioid crisis. Careful provincial expenditure management will continue to be 
required to achieve sustainable black ink, even though five Provinces forecast surpluses for the current fiscal year and several 
other Provinces are making substantive progress in narrowing their Budget gaps.

October 5, 2017 


& Scotiabank’ 


United States 


e The recent hurricanes will have limited effects on the US economy. 
Strong employment gains should boost consumption as a driver of the 
US economic expansion and push growth to 2.2% y/y in 2017, before 
plateauing in 2018 at 2.3% and decelerating to 1.7% y/y in 2019, close to 
potential. 


e The US industrial sector is on track to rise from two years of 
doldrums, stemming from recovery in the extractive sectors and gains 
in capital-goods industries as investment picks up across the 
economy. This rebound could be dampened if federal tax reform fails 
to materialize. 


e The concurrent pick-up in global growth should boost US exports in the 
coming years, but the country’s current account deficit will likely widen 
as imports continue to grow owing to a still-strong US dollar. 


THE MORE VIOLENT THE STORM, THE QUICKER IT PASSES 


Hurricanes Harvey and Irma dominated US news in recent weeks, but despite the 
havoc they wrought in the southern states of the US and Puerto Rico, neither is 
expected to have a meaningful impact on overall US economic activity. US growth 
averaged just above 2% in the first half of 2017, and looks set to come in ata 
similar pace in the second half following the storms (table 1). This steady growth 
performance, with 2.2% y/y projected in 2017 and 2.3% y/y in 2018 (table 2), 
nevertheless remains above both the Fed and Scotiabank Economics’ estimates 
of potential growth averaging around 1.8% during 2017-19 (chart 1). Strong 
consumption growth combined with a rebound in industrial activity should keep the 
US in excess-demand territory during 2017 and 2018, even if Washington proves 
unable to deliver on meaningful changes in taxes and spending. 


US CONSUMERS REGAIN THEIR MOJO 


After a brief early-year lull, consumers are once again leading the US expansion. 
Solid consumer fundamentals, including a robust job market, should sustain 
steady consumption growth of around 2.5% through next year. Monthly hiring 
gains are averaging around 185,000 new positions, a strong performance at this 
late stage of the economic cycle. Consumer confidence is near 16-year highs. 


Wage gains remain muted, but should begin to accelerate given drum-tight labour 
markets and firming labour productivity trends. Most measures of US labour- 
market slack imply that the economy is at full employment. The US jobless rate is 
near a 16-year low of 4.4%, while broader measures of labour underutilization that 
account for marginally attached and underemployed workers are also plumbing 
decade-lows. The job openings (JOLTS) rate is near its highest level since at least 
2000, evidence of growing labour shortages driven by stronger growth and 
demand (chart 2).

Solid household balance sheets also are providing support to consumer spending. 
Rising home and equity values have driven household net worth to record levels. 
Debt-service charges consume about 10% of disposable income, near the lowest 
level on record. Households have rebuilt significant home equity. 


Household vehicle purchases remain resilient, and should continue to move higher 
in 2018 given an ageing vehicle fleet. The slowdown in overall auto sales this year 
in large part reflects de-fleeting in the US rental car market. Replacement demand 
for vehicles damaged by hurricane-induced flooding also will provide a boost to 
sales into 2018. 


There are a few downside risks to the US consumer outlook. An increasing share of 
spending is being financed by debt or savings. Growth in consumer credit has more 
than doubled over the past year to 6% y/y, led by revolving credit. Savings rates 
have been drawn down, and are nearing pre-recession lows (chart 3). Delinquency 
rates are turning up for some debt categories, including credit cards. Conversely, 
the potential for the US administration to implement personal income tax reform 
remains an upside risk. No significant tax relief is currently built into our forecast. 


A MORE MUTED US HOUSING OUTLOOK 


The US housing recovery has lost some momentum. Taking into account weaker 
activity in regions hit hard by recent hurricanes, total existing home sales in 2017 
are expected to end the year largely on par with 2016 levels. Housing starts also are 
expected to be relatively flat year-on-year. 


The fundamental drivers of housing demand remain solid, including low borrowing 
costs, strong job growth, rising incomes, and elevated consumer confidence. 
Lenders are gradually easing loan standards. Millennials are ageing into their prime 
home-buying years. In short, there is still considerable pent-up demand for housing. 
The US homeownership rate, after hitting a record low of 63.1% in mid-2016, is 
edging higher across age cohorts.

Yet, a number of factors are expected to continue to restrain activity. Rising home 
prices, high student debt loads, and a persistent shortage of affordable listings all 
remain a significant hurdle for many potential buyers. The number of available 
existing homes for sale has fallen to historic lows. Market conditions remain most 
challenging for first-time buyers, whose share of home purchases remains stuck at 
just over 30%, well below the historical average of near 40%. Rising rates and higher 


borrowing costs will worsen affordability. 


We have downgraded our expectations for new home construction since last 
quarter’s Global Outlook. While builder confidence remains high, the ability to ramp 
up activity more sharply is constrained by rising land prices, higher construction 
costs, and labour shortages. Housing starts are now expected to total 1.25 and 1.30 
mn units, respectively, in 2018 and 2019—up from an estimated 1.20 mn units this 
year (table 2 again), but still well below underlying demographic requirements 


estimated at around 1.40 mn units annually.

US industrial activity continues to gain momentum. Domestic demand for manufactured products is advancing at its fastest pace 
since 2011 and business confidence has jumped to its highest level since the start of the millennium. Consumer goods originally 
led the way, buoyed by a solid labour market and the healthiest household balance sheets in more than a decade. However, the 
economically-sensitive resource sector and capital goods industries have moved to the forefront of growth in recent months, as 
both US and global growth consolidates (chart 4). In particular, US demand for metal products has advanced at a 10% y/y pace 
this year to date, reversing the sharp fall-off we saw through mid-2016. For example, US steel demand has surged by about 18% 
y/y over the year to date, the best performance since 2011. This improvement reflects enhanced prospects for business 
investment and construction activity, and should be bolstered by reconstruction efforts and increased federal spending following 
the recent hurricanes. For context, in the aftermath of 2005’s Hurricane Katrina, Congress approved aid packages exceeding USD 


100 bn (0.7% of GDP); an even larger stimulus is likely 
following the latest hurricane season. 


BROAD-BASED REBOUND IN BUSINESS INVESTMENT 


US business investment climbed an annualized 7% in 
the first half of 2017, the best performance in three 
years, which has led to a significant acceleration in 
machinery demand. As of August, US machinery 
demand had risen 7% y/y in the year to date, with 
double-digit gains across most industries. While a 54% 
y/y rebound in the oil & gas sector activity in the first half 
of 2017 is providing a major boost to machinery and 
steel products, non-energy investment is also 
strengthening, which is helping to lift non-defense 
capital goods orders at an accelerating pace and points 
to further improvement ahead in business investment 
(chart 5). Of note, US demand for construction 
machinery has surged about 17% y/y so far during

The forecast contribution of current and capital spending across all levels of government 
to annual real GDP growth is projected to edge up to a muted 0.1 percentage point 
annually in 2018 and 2019. State and municipal governments are responding cautiously 
to the ongoing volatility in federal policy discussions given the Republicans’ wish to 
devolve more program responsibility to lower levels of government. We assume a 
moderate widening of the federal fiscal deficit from a low of 2.4% in fiscal 2015 to 3.3% in 
fiscal 2019 as revenue growth fails to keep pace with annual expenditures that are being 





pushed up by net interest payments, mandatory outlays, and significant one-time events. Non-defense capital

the US administration’s key proposals are summarized below, though we acknowledge 

that critical supporting details are not known. Proposed tax relief for citizens includes: 

collapsing the existing seven federal personal income tax brackets to three (i.e., 12%, 25%, and 35%), with the option of a fourth 
bracket for the very highest earners; expanding the standard deductions, enhancing the child tax credit; and eliminating the 
Alternative Minimum Tax and the Estate Tax. For corporations, the federal income tax rate would be trimmed from 35% to 20%, 
and for small businesses that pass through profits to their owners, the tax rate would be 25%. For five years, investment in 
machinery and equipment could be fully written off in the first year. For multinationals operating abroad, the current worldwide tax 
would be replaced by a territorial system. 


Details on the means by which these tax cuts would be financed, however, remain to be determined by Congress. Representatives 
are unlikely to agree to eliminate several key deductions, notably those provided on mortgage interest, charitable donations, and 
state and local taxes, to finance tax reform. As a result, the recently proposed package of reforms is unlikely to succeed, but its 
failure could spur some interim stop-gap measures in order for the White House and legislators to show some progress. 


EXPORTS RISE, BUT TRADE DEFICITS SET TO WORSEN 


American merchandise exports have posted their largest annual gains in half a decade, supported by a substantial recovery in 
commodity exports and renewed strength in manufactures. Higher oil and minerals prices have lifted growth in mining, petroleum, 
and coal exports to a 45% y/y average in the year to July. Last year, these exports shrank at a yearly pace of 22% over the same 
period; their current levels remain at around three-quarters of the export flows that prevailed prior to the 2015 oil crash. Overall, 
total goods exports have grown by 7% y/y as of July, surpassing the 4.1% y/y gains over the same period in services exports—the 
first time this has happened since 2012, thanks mainly to the recovery in the mining sector. 


Still, persistent strength in the USD—which remains near post-recession highs, supported by capital inflows in response to the 
Fed’s efforts to normalize monetary policy—should keep merchandise imports growing faster than exports. While the surplus on 
services trade has remained relatively constant since 2014, a recent 8% y/y increase in the goods trade deficit has contributed to a 
slight widening of the country’s current account deficit (chart 6). The US’s trade and current account deficits will likely continue to 
expand with savings rates at pre-recessions lows (chart 3 again) and the US Administration pushing to provide additional fiscal 
stimulus through infrastructure spending or tax cuts—thereby undermining one White House priority while delivering on another. 


FOREIGN PURCHASES OF US SECURITIES RETURN 


In international financial markets, net foreign purchases of US securities have remained in the black for seven consecutive months, 
the longest streak since 2012-13, after oscillating between net outflows and net inflows nearly every month since mid-2015 as China 
reduced its reserve holdings of US Treasuries (chart 7). In the year to July, Chinese holdings of US Treasuries have recovered by 
some USD 117 bn as pressure on the Chinese authorities to support the yuan have eased. Foreign purchases of domestic corporate 
stocks and fixed-income instruments have also picked up over the last 18 months in the search for yield (chart 8).

THE RISKS OF AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM 


October 5, 2017 


Some aspects of the uncertain policy terrain in the US have firmed up in recent months, while others have become softer. The deal 
between the White House and Congressional Democrats put a temporary end to the debt-ceiling debate, but this issue could flare 
anew in 2018. The recent collapse of successive health-care reform bills exemplifies how the divided Republican-controlled 
Congress may also find it difficult to pass meaningful tax reform or major spending initiatives—which could put a halt on the 
emerging rebound in business investment. Growth could be further stifled by protectionist efforts to crimp the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and stifle trade in, amongst other things, aircraft, lumber, aluminum, steel, and solar panels.

US & Canadian Monetary Policy & Capital Markets 


Scotiabank Economics has not materially altered its forecasts for the Federal 
Reserve, Bank of Canada and broader yield curves. One more hike from each 
central bank this year is still expected to be followed by two more hikes from each 
next year in such fashion as to continue bear flattening the 2s10s slopes of each 
country’s yield curve as a neutral influence upon CAD (charts 1, 2). We forecast a 
constant overnight rate spread of -25bps over our forecast horizon with policy 
rates coming close to if not converging upon neutral rate assumptions in 2019. 


BANK OF CANADA — PAUSE, THEN GRADUAL 


The BoC is expected to hike by 25bps in December and twice more in 2018 
around April and October timelines. In timing the next hike, the risk is skewed 
toward later than December rather than sooner. By 2019, a neutral policy rate 
range of 2—2.5% is forecast for this cycle. 


Governor Poloz’s recent speech and press conference continue to leave the door 
open to further rate hikes while also indicating some patience and data 
dependence (here). In reference to how tightening involves more than just 
reversing the two cuts in 2015, Poloz stated that “At a minimum, that additional 
stimulus is no longer needed.” Briefly summarized, a pause was signalled by a) 
stating that the BoC will “feel our way cautiously”, b) indicating nothing 
“mechanical in our approach to monetary policy” which leans against a straight 
line of uninterrupted policy moves in anticipation of model-based developments, c) 
flagging still-soft wage data, d) indicating uncertainty over the investment cycle 
and its influences upon spare capacity and hence inflation pressures, and d) 
indicating uncertainty toward the “cause, size and persistence” of currency 
movements and associated effects. 


The reasons for a tightening bias continue to include: 


e The lifting of domestic idiosyncratic inflation drivers as prices for gasoline, 
autos and electricity turn from being disinflationary toward reflationary; 


e The general output gap framework as spare capacity has largely closed on 
the back of strong growth while we anticipate that a slower-growing economy 
will slip marginally into excess aggregate demand going forward. With the 
customary lag, a mild rise in inflationary pressure is anticipated (chart 3). 


e Event risk has subsided. It appears unlikely a) that the US will impose border 
taxes, b) that NAFTA will be a major macro-event as opposed to a sector- 
specific consideration, and c) that Canada will import a major bond market 
shock from the US on the application of fiscal and regulatory stimulus late in 
the cycle while the term premium rises as the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet shrinks (more on this below). 


e Financial stability risks. The corrections in Vancouver's and Toronto’s housing 
markets will likely prove to be temporary and motivate further comfort toward 
tightening at a gradual pace. Indeed, household credit growth has accelerated 
over the summer.

& Scotiabank’ 


e To sterilize a fiscal policy overshoot. The combined application of monetary and fiscal policy stimulus led to stronger-than- 
expected GDP growth averaging nearly 4% over the past four quarters in inflation-adjusted terms. 


FEDERAL RESERVE — CONVENTIONAL TIGHTENING 


A rate hike in December is expected to be followed by two more hikes in 2018 around June and December timelines and hence 
one less than the Fed’s ‘dot plot’ guidance. We then anticipate that a neutral policy target range of 2.25—2.5% will be realized into 
2019 as the rate hike cycle comes to a close. 


There are at least three main considerations that are guiding our forecast beyond the underlying growth and spare capacity 
fundamentals that we think support further hikes. 


1. Inflation And The Dollar 


Inflation is probably undergoing transitory headwinds related to past USD strength. As — Chart 4 


the USD has weakened since spring, a higher inflation profile is anticipated and USD’s Rise and Fall 
this should support a return to policy tightening. While the connection between the Impacting Inflation 
dollar and inflation is hardly air-tight, large, abrupt swings in the dollar tend to be more 49g [index, Jan 1997=100 


correlated with large, abrupt swings in import prices (chart 4) and modest pass-through 





to CPI. The broad dollar index is now at its lowest since April 2016 and has reversed all _ 
of the pre- and post-election rally and then some. A more muted correction in the dollar — 
in early 2016 was followed by a rise in core PCE inflation from about 1.2% y/y to 1.9% eae 
y/y with several drivers, the USD among them. i20 
118 
It is important to recall the literature and to note that the Federal Reserve views the 116 rita 
currency’s role in this way. Indeed this speech about two years ago by retiring Vice 114 
Chairman Stanley Fischer was specifically on the very topic of exchange rate effects on 449 
growth and inflation. Fischer stated that Fed models indicate that for every 10% trade- 110 
weighted appreciation in the dollar, core PCE inflation is reduced by 0.5% in the two 15 16 17 
quarters following the dollar's move and the four-quarter effect is to reduce core PCE pa ananie patie oe: 


inflation by about 0.3%. Note that the broad dollar index appreciated by about 9% from 
the spring of 2016 until early 2017 and has since depreciated by a similar amount. 


It is therefore conceivable that much of the deceleration in core PCE inflation from 1.9% at the start of this year to 1.4% as of 
August was due to the dollar’s prior appreciation. By corollary, dollar depreciation since earlier this year may well have the 
Fed much closer to its inflation target as soon as 2018H1. 


2. Rely On Conventional Tightening 


As explained in the yield curve forecasts below, it’s unlikely that the Fed will be able to singlehandedly cheapen the Treasury curve 
through raising the term premium via reduced reinvestment. Thus, unconventional policy tightening is no clear substitute for 
conventional policy tightening. It therefore remains unclear that the Fed should count upon unconventional tightening in lieu of 
conventional rate hikes as some FOMC officials appeared to suggest or implied comfort toward over the summer. 


3. Sterilizing Other Policy Stimulus 


Will potential fiscal and regulatory policy easing be achieved in such fashion as to offer meaningful macroeconomic benefits? This 
is a hugely loaded question that present space is not suited to addressing in full, but our assumption is that there will be very little 
macroeconomic benefit to potential policy reforms. If we’re wrong then markets and Federal Reserve policy may sterilize the 
outcomes which means the Fed’s response to fiscal policy initiatives ranges between being relatively benign to 
incrementally hawkish relative to our base case scenario. 


Visit our web site at scotiabank.com/economics or contact us by email at scotia.economics@scotiabank.com 18 


& Scotiabank’ 


One argument not on this list of key considerations is that FOMC officials desire 
policy tightening in order to build future policy flexibility away from the lower 
bound on rates should downside risks to the economy and the Fed’s dual 
mandate resurface. There may be some who believe this, but the embedded 
circular logic is that the Fed wishes to court recession risks through policy 
tightening that is otherwise unsuitable so that it has the flexibility to counter the 
next recession. 


YIELD CURVES — ASYMMETRIC TERM PREMIUM RESPONSE? 


A key issue governing the outlook for the yield curves (see table) is whether the 
Treasury term premium rises as the Fed reduces its balance sheet holdings of 
Treasuries and MBS and at what pace. | think the term premium will rise more 
slowly as the balance sheet shrinks than it fell as QE expanded the balance sheet 
over the post-crisis period. That doesn’t mean Treasuries can’t cheapen further 
from here over the next year, with our forecast being that US 10 year yields end 
2018 at about 2%%, but added pressures from a big rise in the term premium are 
unlikely in my view. 


Research (here) suggests US 10 year Treasury yields are about 1% lower than 
where they would be otherwise in the absence of the Fed’s balance sheet 
expansion and controlling for other influences. The view that the Treasury term 


premium will rise less materially than it fell (i.e., a shallow ‘U’ versus a ‘V’) is based 


upon many other considerations affecting the Treasury market than just the Fed’s 
balance sheet that have markets understanding the reduction plan but in the 
context of other considerations. They include: 


e Late cycle concerns that could slow, halt or reverse balance sheet reduction 
plans at some point along the multi-year plan. There is practically zero 
science around timing a business cycle but the risks of disappointment 
somewhere along the way are more material when one is dealing with the 
third longest expansion on record that will soon become the second longest 
than they would be if the expansion were at a more embryonic stage; 


e The actions of other major QE central banks whose balance sheets will not 
be shrinking for years (BoE) or will continue to expand even if at a slower 
pace in future (ECB, BoJ). Please see chart 5. This is unlike the taper 
tantrum in May 2013 in that other central banks were nowhere nearly as 
active including the ECB whose balance sheet was shrinking at the time. 
The estimate of the term premium’s reduction via the Fed’s QE program 
was also skewed toward a period when QE1 and QE2 were rolled out 
before much more aggressive foreign central bank actions on conventional 
(negative policy rates) and unconventional (QE, guidance, term lending 
programs, etc.) policies. The ability of the Fed to cheapen the Treasury 
market on its own is limited in a world of connected carry trades adjusted for 
FX hedging risks if other foreign central banks are still hesitant to allow their 
own yields to rise materially. 


e Elevated stock markets may merit a safe-haven bid that preserves demand 
for Treasuries.

e The reinvestment caps (chart 6) are theoretical and not binding. The actual amounts allowed to roll off the balance sheet each 
month depend upon the flow of maturing securities and, in the case of MBS, prepayments risk. Starting about a year from 
now, there will be several months each year in which the actual amount of Treasuries maturing and rolling off the balance 
sheet will be materially lower than the theoretical investment caps. 


e Neutral rate estimates continue to move lower and are the ultimate anchor for the curve’s pricing of potential future Fed rate 
policy actions. 


e There are various other influences upon the term premium that has been dropping for decades and well before QE, like 
estimates of long-run inflation risk (chart 7). On that note, the 5y5y inflation swap is pricing longer-run inflation of 2.3% at the 
moment which seems fairly reasonable at this point.

Mexico 
MIXED SIGNS WITH A POSITIVE BALANCE 


e Mexico is grieving the losses suffered as a consequence of two terrible 
earthquakes in September. It is still too early to determine the likely 
effects on the macroeconomic landscape, but we think they will be 
relatively small. 


e Some of the recent economic indicators present conflicting results that 
could imply the Mexican economy is slowing down; while others point 
the other way. We see the positive balance prevailing, and thus we are 
once again raising our GDP forecasts. 


e Contrasting with the market’s view that monetary policy will be rapidly 
eased in 2018, we still expect Banco de Mexico to increase its reference 
interest rate a couple more times. 


September was a disastrous month for Mexico. Two strong earthquakes produced 
terrible human losses and severe damage, mainly in the center-south region, 
affecting Mexico City, Puebla, State of Mexico, Oaxaca, Chiapas and Morelos. 
There is not yet a final assessment of the devastation, but the death toll across 
the country is more than 330. In Mexico City alone, over 3,000 buildings were 
damaged and 40 buildings collapsed. Most of productive infrastructure was not 
seriously affected, even though some sections of the highway between Mexico 
City and Acapulco were destroyed and the Salina Cruz refinery in Oaxaca was 
shut down for some weeks. 


It is difficult to assess the impact on the macroeconomic variables, but in our view, 
effects on economic growth and inflation will be barely observable and transitory. 
Our preliminary estimate of the impact on third quarter GDP growth is less than 
0.2 percentage points, not affecting the growth forecast for the whole year. 
Inflation could reveal some pressures as the unusual demand for several products 
increased and business inventories fell. Some other price increases could be 
observed during the reconstruction phase, especially in construction materials 
such as cement, steel, glass, etc. In any case, these pressures will be temporary 
and are not expected to have a material impact on inflation. 


Turning to the economy, there are currently some mixed signals that are difficult to 
interpret. Retail sales are showing a significant slowdown (see chart 1), barely 
growing in real terms on a y/y basis in June and July. Much of this slower pace is 
explained by the weakness in auto sales (-4.8% y/y in June and -4.3% y/y in July), 
and departmental stores and supermarkets (-0.9% y/y in June and -0.1% y/y in 
July). There are, however, strong increases in health care items (+7.4% y/y), 
paper and leisure products (+8.0% y/y), home appliances and computers (+11.0% 
y/y) and TV and e-commerce (+10.3% y/y), all of them in July. Worth noting is that 
some of the slowdown is explained by the unexpected acceleration in inflation.

a confluence of factors, including the “Semana Santa’ effect, the public investment 
cuts to strengthen the fiscal stance, and the likely increase in uncertainty levels due 
to the new government in the USA and the coming change of government in Mexico 
next year. 


A very positive performance on external trade has been observed during the year. 
Non-oil exports reached US$ 376.6 billion in the 12 month accumulated sum in 
August, growing 7.0% y/y, while imports reached US$ 369.6 billion and expanded by 
3.8% y/y. Chart 4 shows the positive reaction of trade during the last year. Most of Source: INEGI 
this result is explained by the relative strength showed recently in the US economy. 





On balance, we still perceive the Mexican economy to be on a positive track, and as a consequence, we are once again revising 
our macroeconomic scenario toward a faster pace of growth. GDP growth for 2017 is revised to 2.4% from 2.0% in the previous 
quarterly report. For the coming two years we still expect a gradual additional improvement, with a 2.7% GDP growth forecast for 
2018 and 3.1% for 2019. 


A special comment should be made about our interest rate forecast. Most analysts expect that Banco de Mexico will cut interest rates 
in 2018. However, inflation has been on the rise, and even though we share the view that inflation will begin a rapid decline during 
2018 once the shocks observed during 2017 fade away, we anticipate that inflation will be higher than expected in 2017 and then will 
not fall below 4% during 2018. There are some concerning signs that could be interpreted as demand-side pressures, for instance, 
tuition fees keep accelerating, reaching 4.74% in the first half of September. Since inflationary risk keeps rising, we still believe Banco 
de Mexico will need to make a couple more hikes to the reference interest rate, one this year and another early next year. 


A final comment should be made about the political landscape in Mexico, now that the electoral process has formally begun. In the 
coming months, no later than February 22"°, candidates should be appointed, and a fierce struggle within most parties is expected. 
Banco de Mexico will have a new Governor, and one likely candidate is the current Minister of Finance, José Antonio Meade, who 
could also become the PRI presidential candidate. There will be a lot of changes and uncertainty in the coming months, and 
depending on the final outcome, expect some financial market volatility.

United Kingdom 


e The Bank of England has flagged that a rate hike is likely to be delivered 
at the next meeting in November. 


e We expect moderate further tightening to be delivered during 2018, 
helped by accelerating growth and wage inflation in the new year. 


e We expect inflation to rise slightly further in the near term (to above 3% 
y/y), before slowing fairly abruptly during 2018. 


WHAT’S NEW? 


The most striking change over the past month has been the change in the 
Bank of England’s tone. The latest Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) 
minutes were clearly hawkish and the recent data flow has been upbeat. The 
combination of both makes a rate hike at the November meeting appear 
almost certain. 


Thus far, the MPC has been prepared to tolerate inflation somewhat above target, 
justified by there being a reasonably wide margin of spare capacity. However, the 
Bank’s view is that the margin of spare capacity is being eroded more quickly than 
expected—not least because of the latest downwards surprise in the 
unemployment rate. The BoE also recently judged that the potential growth rate in 
the UK has slowed, making it easier for slack to be eroded. Last but not least, 
near term inflation prints have exceeded BoE expectations and the committee 
judges that wage inflation is probably more buoyant than the official data imply. 
Both suggest that inflation will continue to exceed the Bank’s inflation target. The 
bottom line is that the committee’s tolerance is wearing thin and the first rate hike 
is imminent. 


The next consideration is whether this rate move is the first of several, or merely a 
reversal of last August’s emergency rate cut in the aftermath of the EU 
referendum result. We suspect that there will be further increases in Bank Rate 
during 2018, though the data will dictate the timing. Our view is that the MPC will 
be opportunistic; clawing back interest rate ammunition when the activity data 
appear strong enough to support such moves. In that context, we doubt that the 
data will support a second rate hike as soon as the February “Super Thursday” 
MPC meeting. However, towards the middle of the year we would expect concrete 
evidence of accelerating wage inflation and an upwards path in GDP growth to 
pave the way to further increases in Bank Rate. 


GROWTH 


We expect a mediocre GDP reading during Q3; around 0.3% q/q. That would be 
slightly below the Bank of England’s new judgement of trend growth (around 0.4% 
q/q) but in line with its own forecast of 0.3% q/q for Q3. The headwinds facing the 
consumer have intensified in recent months; with inflation accelerating further and 
wage inflation no higher. This should persist until early next year, helping to keep 
growth at a dreary %% q/q in Q4-2017 and Q1-2018.

October 5, 2017 


Next year should be a better year for growth, depending on which figure you look at. We expect the quarterly growth rates to be on 
an upwards trajectory throughout 2018, rising from “4% q/q in early 2018, up to around “2% q/q by the end of the year. While we 
view that as an improvement, it would translate into an annual average growth rate of 174% y/y—somewhat lower than the latest 
BoE projection. 


The shape of our growth profile is heavily influenced by the consumer. The downwards path for growth in 2017 has been almost 
entirely due to the squeeze on household real disposable income growth, in turn due to accelerating inflation set against sluggish 
wage inflation. That should reverse during 2018 as inflation decelerates and wage inflation gains traction. Investment and net trade 
have threatened to prop up growth, but thus far there has been little evidence of this. That is likely to be a reflection of uncertainty, 
both given the Brexit process as well as the muted pace of GDP growth. We doubt that will change any time soon. 


INFLATION 


We believe that the peak in inflation is imminent. Virtually all of the acceleration in inflation over the past year has been due to 
sharply rising imported inflation. However, as chart 1 illustrates, this uplift should be coming to an end very soon. We expect CPI 
inflation to peak at around 3.1% y/y in September and October—triggering a letter from the BoE Governor to the Chancellor to 
explain why inflation is so far above target and what the MPC plans to do to remedy the situation. This is largely symbolic and 
should not rock the boat. 


Moreover, we expect inflation to decelerate fairly abruptly over the subsequent 12 month period, particularly as the uplift from 
imported inflation begins to unwind. Indeed, our forecast for CPI inflation for next year is a reasonable margin below the BoE’s 
latest forecast. We believe that there is a good chance that CPI inflation will undershoot the 2% y/y target by late-2018, particularly 
in light of the recent appreciation in the GBP exchange rate. This view is somewhat at odds with the market, which seems to be 
taking the view that inflation will be sticky and take much longer to gravitate back towards the 2% target. The complete lack of 
acceleration in domestically generated inflation (gauged in chart 2, via core services inflation) suggests to us that pricing power is 
lacking. As such, we take the view that second round effects from the sharp increase in imported inflation will be less than others 
have assumed. 


ANY OTHER BUSINESS 


Wage inflation, or the lack of it, is going to be a major determinant of how soon we should expect to see another rate hike (assuming 
the BoE does deliver a rate rise at the next meeting). Despite the low headline rate of wage inflation, the BoE has judged that 
composition effects (a reduction in the proportion of high-pay employees relative to an increase in the proportion of low-pay workers) 
is distorting the wage inflation figures lower. While the MPC is likely to look through the muted wage data for now, we suspect that 
they will want to await news of how private sector pay settlements perform at the start of the calendar year before hiking rates 
further. A 42-year low in the unemployment rate, sharply higher CPI and RPI inflation and anecdotal reports of less plentiful 
availability of migrant workers all point to some upwards drift in pay growth. Meanwhile the lack of productivity growth and multiple 
demands on corporate cashflow (apprenticeship levy, auto-enrolment in pensions, national living wage, etc.) are still cannibalising 
firms’ ability to increase pay growth. As such, we have aimed moderately higher for wage inflation next year, consistent with only 
moderate policy tightening.

Given our view that core inflation will drift sideways, headline inflation will be at the mercy of non-core components; namely food 
and energy. In the absence of sharp swings in energy and food, headline inflation is likely to reside between 1% y/y and 172% y/y 
over the course of 2018 before gaining further ground towards the 2% y/y target during 2019. 


POLICY 


Against that backdrop, the ECB will have to weigh up the competing influences of above-trend GDP growth versus subdued 
inflation. Since the ECB’s mandate is to control inflation, we suspect that the latter will take precedence. As such, we would 
envisage that the Governing Council will announce a further expansion of its asset purchase programme once the current 
programme expires in December. We would expect the pace of asset purchases to be halved (i.e. tapered), down from EUR60bn 
per month to EUR30bn per month. That would probably rule out any tightening in the ECB refi rate at least until 2019. 


Political risk in the eurozone has faded and was the dog that didn’t bark, let alone bite during 2017. The Dutch, French and German 
elections all passed without any major market-moving outcomes. The Italian election (most likely in 2018) could cause some jitters, 
but the worst of the political risk in the Eurozone seems to have been averted.

Brazil 


e Acombination of reform progress (in which we think the TJLP changes 
are particularly relevant—even if we expect a gradual impact), the 
Brazilian Central Bank’s revamped credibility, and a stabilization in 
public finances has allowed rates to drop quite substantially. This in 
turn is giving the highly indebted economy some relief, and is boosting 
consumer spending by freeing up disposable income. However, there 
are still some risks to this rates compression, which are to a large 
degree linked to politics. 


e On the political front, there are two main sources of uncertainty: the 
2018 Presidential elections, and whether the government will be able to 
approve the key reforms. In our view, the most important reform will be 
pensions, which is highly relevant for the country’s fiscal sustainability, 
but it may also play an important part in next year’s presidential 
elections because given its unpopularity, approving pensions reform 
could open the way for the PT to defeat the reformers. 


There are many important questions about Brazil as we head into the close of 
2017, and most of them come down to politics. However, there is also some 
uncertainty over when the economy will start posting a more sustained recovery, 
as well as what will drive it. Regarding the growth rebound, we see some scope 
for base effects and a recovery in confidence to drive an improvement, but those 
two factors alone are unlikely to support a sustained recovery. Household 
spending has been heavily burdened by high indebtedness (see chart 1), but 
some relief is coming in the form of lower interest rates, which should continue 
helping alleviate the debt service burden families face. Are lower interest rates 
sustainable? Our take is there are many moving parts. The BCB has successfully 
brought inflation back under control, which is allowing it to cut interest rates quite 
aggressively (the SELIC rate has been cut from 14.25% to 8.25% since October 
2016). We and markets expect further cuts, but there is the risk that if reforms are 
not passed, we could see investor disappointment put the currency (BRL) under 
depreciating pressures, and push inflation higher. 


On a more structural trend, we see room for the reform of the TJLP rate allowing 
Brazil’s market clearing rates to decline. The reason is that it should help de- 
segment local lending markets, by bringing tier-1 borrowers back into the pool 
(BNDES had essentially taken tier-1 borrowers out of the market), thus lowering 
clearing rates. This positive factor should play out gradually. Finally, there is a 
fiscal aspect to lower rates. Over recent years, the rapid deterioration of Brazil’s 
fiscal position drove the loss of its investment grade rating, and put upward 
pressure on rates. However, even though the deficit is still wide (we could see a 
public deficit of around 6% of GDP this year) and the overall debt load is high 
(gross public debt is rapidly converging to 90% of GDP), the pace of the 
deterioration is improving, and markets are giving the current government the 
benefit of the doubt, driving a compression in credit premiums (5yr CDS have 
tightened 300bps since their highs a couple of years ago, trading around 200bps 
at the moment).

Regarding monetary policy, the DI curve shows markets look for 125bps of additional rate cuts. Our take is that although neutral 
rates have likely fallen somewhat with the changes that the government has implemented and those that are expected (including 
TJLP reform), they are still relatively high. We would not be surprised if real neutral monetary policy rates are still somewhere 
around 4%, from around 5% prior to reforms. This means that the additional rate cuts that markets expect from here could be 
reversed as the economy comes back on track but, for now, we tend to agree that more cuts are likely in the pipeline. However, 
this view is not without risks. The biggest risk in our opinion is the BRL. Our take is that the real’s nominal depreciation has more 
than been eaten away by inflation, and in our view, the real is now on the “expensive side” (hence our FX call). If the reforms, 
particularly pensions (for which debate keeps getting pushed back) fall through, we should see market disappointment translate 
into depreciating pressures on the BRL, which could in turn derail the BCB’s easing cycle as Brazil's FX-inflation pass-through is 
relatively high. Hence, what happens on both the reform and election front next year is key for Brazilian assets, and also for how 
low local rates can get, and how long they can stay there. 


On the political front, there are two major risks worth tracking, and they are both related — and highly relevant to the macro 
outlook. The first is the reform approval process which is moving forward much more slowly than markets anticipated, and we think 
it's partly due to the PT now being back on its feet, after seemingly being brought to its knees by President Rousseff’s 
impeachment. A risk is that with Presidential elections looming in November 2018, and the pension reform (arguably the most 
important) having about a 70% rejection rate, politicians will be unable to get the bill approved before it trips up with the electoral 
period. The bill has already been materially watered down, but even in its watered-down state, the vote has been repeatedly 
delayed. Failure to get the bill approved before the end of 18-Q1 would likely trigger some pressure on Brazilian assets. A second 
risk related to this is how the approval of the pension bill would impact the outlook for next year’s elections if it were to materialize. 
Our take is that markets would see a return of the PT as negative for Brazilian assets, given the poor fiscal performance of the 
country during its last administration. At the moment, given the judicial process against him, it’s unclear whether President Lula will 
be a contender next year. However, even if he does contend, the path to victory does not look easy despite Lula being the most 
popular politician in the country. Despite Lula’s high popularity (he continues to come out at the top of nearly all polls), he also has 
a high rejection rate (between 40% and 50% in recent polls), which means winning in a second round run-off would likely be tough, 
as he has a very low ceiling which should hurt him in a run-off vote. Where the pension bill comes in, is that if approved, it could 
increase rejection towards reformist candidates, and could tip the electoral balance in favor of the PT, or Lula. Hence, there is both 
a lot at stake on the political front, but there is also a lot of uncertainty.

Colombia 


Colombia’s economic performance continues to suggest a gradual 
recovery, consistent with looser policy settings, and a strengthening 
in confidence, as well as acceleration in the execution of government 
infrastructure spending which we expect to gain traction over coming 
months. 


Even though we tend to agree with consensus that BanRep will 
continue to cut rates, we see risks to this view, primarily coming from 
possible depreciation pressure on the Colombian peso. These 
pressures could come from worse-than-expected fiscal results, or the 
upcoming Presidential elections. 


News on Colombia’s outlook has been mixed, but remains consistent with an 
economy that is gradually gaining traction, accelerating as we near year-end. 
The sectors of the economy that are still serving as a drag are the mining 
industry and construction. On the construction front, we expect more dynamic 
performance heading into 2018. Furthermore, it is worth noting that retail sales 
are posting better performance as the year turns into the second half (+3.0% in 
the latest release), but they are still being hurt by relatively high unemployment. 
Hence, we expect GDP to continue strengthening over coming quarters, and 
sector performance to become more balanced. We expect growth of +1.9% this 
year (Bloomberg consensus +1.7%), to be followed by a more robust +2.5% in 
2018 (Bloomberg consensus +2.6%), and a closer to potential +3.1% in 2019 
(Bloomberg consensus +3.0%). The gradual strengthening of the economy is 
consistent with our view that both the 4G infra program, and the peace process 
will bring accelerated growth with them, but the benefits will slowly gain 
momentum. 


The main concern among market players in our view is whether the rebound will 
be strong enough to match the macro assumptions that the government is using 
for its fiscal plan. Markets, and Scotiabank Economics, are still skeptical that the 
economy can recover enough to match the official projections (we’re not sure 
that growth will top 4.0% in 2019-2025 as the government projects) which feed 
into the country’s fiscal rule. This concern about whether the public finances 
have been properly anchored is one of the reasons why local rates have come 
under pressure (upwards), and one of the reasons the country’s credit ratings 
still have some downgrade risk (we assign a 30% probability to a downgrade). 


On the rates front, the latest minutes from BanRep are consistent with continued 
cuts in interest rates, given the board sees inflation still converging towards the 
mid-point of the inflation target, even if there is some upward pressure from food 
prices that will generate some noise heading into year-end (similar to elsewhere 
in LATAM). The latest decision was split, with 4 members voting for a 25bps cut, 
and 2 members voting for a 50bps cut. There was also one member who voted 
for a pause. Our take is that acceleration in the pace of rate cuts is unlikely, 
given the majority of the board believes that—with the cut delivered last time— 
rate settings are already in neutral. The board believes the economy has

already touched bottom and is starting a gradual rebound—hence we see no rush on the easing front, particularly as food 
continues to pressure inflation upwards. 


Regarding the outlook for interest rates, we are roughly in line with consensus in the latest BanRep survey, although we are 
relatively hawkish in our skew of risks. The first reason for caution we see is that in the most recent survey of expectations, we 
saw that economists broadly expect inflation to rise to slightly above BanRep’s target as we head to year-end (consensus looks 
for 4.2% inflation by December). Given the inflation spike is driven by likely temporary pressures coming from food prices, we 
don’t see this shock on its own as serious. However, if the shock were to be accompanied by a material depreciation of the 
Colombian peso, the risks become higher, given Colombia still has relatively high FX-inflation pass-through (20%—30%). 





What can trigger a sell-off in the Colombian peso? Barring an external shock (the Fed?), we believe there are two primary 
sources of domestic risk: the first is the Presidential elections in May 2018, which could make investors nervous if an anti- 
establishment candidate were to emerge as a strong contender. Our take is that there will be two main camps within the 
establishment, primarily representing supporters of President Santos and of former President Uribe. The main difference 
between the two is approaches to the peace process, and we see little differences on the macro front. However, there is also 
the possibility that a third camp, to the left of the political spectrum, could emerge (former Mayor of Bogota Gustavo Petro has 
been strong in recent polls, and we have heard some, still small, degree of concern among investors). The second domestic 
risk we see is related to public finances, and the potential for credit rating downgrades. If the situation does not improve, we 
could see downgrades materialize, which would leave Colombia at the threshold of investment grade, which could spook some 
investors. However, we note we see a loss of investment grade as a low probability risk.

Zavala, has been replaced by the current Vice-President and member of 
Congress, Mercedes Araoz. Zavala was also Minister of Finance, and has been 
replaced in that role by Claudia Cooper, who was acting as Vice-Minister of 
Economy. Other cabinet changes include: Minister of Justice, of Education, of 
Health, and of Housing. Six cabinet members in all were changed, while twelve 
were ratified. We do not expect any major disruption in policy, outside of 
moderate adjustments. The six new members may signify policy shifts within 
their jurisdictions; however, these shifts will remain within a generally market- 
friendly and business-friendly framework. This includes Cooper at Finance, who 
is known to be orthodox and mainstream in her economic views. In general, 
Peru’s new cabinet is similar to the past in that its members are predominantly 
independent, with a technical (apolitical) profile. 


Congress seems to have accepted the new cabinet, at least for now. However, 
there is no real guarantee that the PPK regime and opposition Congress will get 
along much better. The replacement of the former Minister of Justice (Marisol 
Perez Tello), by Enrique Mendoza has reopened the discussion of the pardon 
(“indulto”) and freedom of Alberto Fujimori. An event such as this would have 
political consequences that are not easy to predict. 


Markets have reacted with calm to the change in cabinet and events that led to 
it. In part, perhaps, because everything occurred so quickly and over the 
weekend, but also | believe it reflects the confidence that neither Congress nor 
the government is interested in changing economic policy significantly. 


Meanwhile, economic news is not strong, but in general points to an economy 
that is rebounding after El Niho. GDP grew 1.6% in July, YoY, and 2.2% during 
the first seven months of the year. The softer growth figures compared to 3.6% 
in June and 3.4% in May, reflecting the fact that resource sectors (mining and 
fishmeal) are no longer driving growth. This was expected. Growth figures from 
now on will reflect non-resource sectors, more linked to domestic demand, 
which fell to 1% levels during the El Nifo months, and has since rebounded 
closer to 2%.

The growth outlook is set to improve as we approach the end of the year, as 
government investment is, finally, rising in earnest and starting to drive the 
economy. After declining nearly every month from September 2016 to April 
2017, government investment has risen at an increasing pace since May, with a 
24% YoY increase in August. 


Government spending should only get stronger. The government announced 
details for investment in post-Nifo reconstruction and the Panamerican Games, 
which includes a 10% spending increase in its 2018 budget. Public investment 
will rise 18%. This is in line with our expectations of GDP growth rising from 
2.5% in 2017 to 3.7% in 2018. 


Another source driving growth expectations is the performance of metal prices. 
Even with the recent retracement, most metal prices that are important to Peru 
are still way ahead of expectations. This is feeding into improving external 
accounts, a strengthening FX rate (held back by significant Central Bank 
intervention), less concern over deteriorating fiscal accounts, and rising 
business confidence. All in all, macro accounts are improving and expectations 
are rising, despite political events. This seems largely to be what was behind the 
decision both by Moody’s and Fitch to maintain Peru’s credit rating and “stable” 
outlook. 


The Central Bank has continued to do its part as well. The CB lowered its 
reference rate in September to 3.50%, the third 25bps decline in the year. The 
CB was clear in signaling that it would reduce the rate in September, and has 
stated its intention to continue giving clear guidance on what it will do from one 
month to the next. For October, it has signaled a pause. After that is anyone’s 
guess, but we would not be surprised to see one more 25bps decrease before 
the CB ends its expansionary policy. 


The CB continues to be more concerned about growth than inflation. Twelve- 
month inflation to August came in at 3.2%. This was above the CB target range, 
but the CB seems convinced that this reflects temporary supply shocks, and that 
inflation will fall well below its 3.0% target ceiling before the year ends. 


Peru is slowly transitioning to more robust, investment-driven growth. It would be 
helpful if politics could also transition to a state of less conflict and uncertainty.

Chile 
RISING OPTIMISM, BUT RISKS REMAIN 


e The situation for the Chilean economy remains very similar to that 
described one month ago. The economy is stabilizing, and 2018 growth 
is expected to reach its highest level since 2013 as the political situation 
improves. 


e Though risks for 2018 growth are tilted to the upside, worsening terms 
of trade and some potential political challenges represent possible 
downside risks to the forecast. 


MACRO UPDATE: SMALL BUT MEANINGFUL CHANGES 


No significant data changes have taken place since our last report. We continue to 
forecast growth of 1.4% for the current year and 2.8% for 2018, which is more 
conservative than the Central Bank’s forecast. In September the Central Bank 
increased the average of its forecast range for economic growth from 1.375% to 
1.5% for the current year and kept the forecast at 3% for 2018. Though the 
upward revision was modest, it ended the recent string of negative revisions to the 
growth outlook. On the inflation side, the forecast for the current year was revised 
down (from 2.6% to 2.4%) and upward for 2018 (3% vs. previous 2.9%). In the 
same report, the potential growth for the Chilean economy was cut to the range 
2.5%-3%. 


All in all, although monetary policy rate (MPR) cuts were not ruled out, no change 
to the MPR (currently at 2.5%) is the most likely scenario for the coming months. 
Aligned with that, we maintain our expectation of no change in MPR up to mid- 
2018. Were stronger-than-expected growth to materialize, this could lead to a re- 
assessment of this view. In the very short term, the Central Bank should not be 
too uncomfortable with a twelve-month accumulated inflation temporarily in the 
low half of its reference range (2%—4%). Along with the reduction in inflation, the 
exchange spot rate (CLP/USD) started to recover, though there was likely a much 
more powerful reason for it: a pullback of the copper price and the strengthening 
of the US dollar in the international markets. We continue to expect a year-end 
value around 640, which would be consistent with forecast values for most of the 
variables that historically condition the exchange rate. 


POLITICAL PANORAMA: SHARPER PICTURE... STILL BLURRY 


In the political arena, the changes have not been very dramatic either. Surveys 
show that relative position for presidential election remains almost the same, led 
by former President Sebastian Pifera (center-right) with 43%, followed far behind 
by Alejandro Guillier (center-left, pro current Government) with 19%, and Beatriz 
Sanchez (left) with 13%. Just to Pifera’s left and right there are two candidates 
(Goic and Kast, respectively) with 4% each. That picture means the November 
19" election will be followed by a ballotage on December 17", for which Mr. 
Piflera keeps the first option. Though this is the most likely scenario, there are two 
additional political risks: first, the parliamentary election (half senate and whole 
Deputies Chamber) where results are far from being clear and, second, the ability

of the new Administration to accomplish both short- and long-term improvements 
(tax reform, labor reform, environmental institutions, among many other). Some 
surveys show that this political uncertainty, though lower than in other Latin 
American countries, in addition to the implementation of damaging reforms in the 
previous three years and the deterioration of the terms of trade, has reduced the 
flow of investment, with investors adopting a wait-and-see attitude. 


The resignation of the core of the economic team (on August 31") highlighted the 
cracks in the ruling coalition, but is unlikely to mean dramatic changes in the 
current economic policy of the government. Its tenure ends within six months (on 
March 11", 2018), which is a limited timespan to make changes, especially when 
the government's popularity, though improving, is still low and there is a widening 
rejection of previous reforms or, at least, skepticism about them. The new 
economic team (which is headed by the same people as in Mr. Lagos’ center-left 
administration in 2000—2006) is apparently focused on continuing with the 
previous line, to capitalize on improvement in expectations or growth that could 
come from better terms of trade and the perspective of a new political environment 
(as in other countries in the region). In that context, the design of a 2018 balanced 
budget seems the first priority. 


MAIN RISKS 


These conditions for investment imply a two-fold short-term risk: a) decisions 
could be on hold before knowing the result of the election and the performance 
under the new political scenario, and/or b) a growing pent-up demand for 
investment that might burst in 2018. Of course, consequences of the first would be 
more concerning that those of the second, but either of them might cause large 
impacts in activity, demand, prices, rates, etc.

China 


e China is set to remain among global engines of growth, yet real GDP 
gains will likely decelerate to 6% y/y by the end of 2019. 


e Important leadership meeting in October will determine the pace and 
focus of forthcoming structural reforms. 


ROBUST ECONOMIC GROWTH AHEAD OF PARTY CONGRESS 


China’s economic growth will remain reasonably sound through 2019 despite the 
fact that the pace is set to decelerate gradually. We estimate that the nation’s real 
GDP growth will average 6.7% this year and move toward the 6% mark by 2019. 
The moderate slowdown reflects the economy's continued transition from reliance 
on credit-fuelled investment toward consumer-driven activity (chart 1) and it will 
put the Chinese economy onto a healthier and more sustainable footing. Despite 
the gradual deceleration, China will continue to be among the world’s growth 
outperformers and its significance in the world economy will continue to increase. 
We assess that while the economy has built substantial imbalances in recent 
years due to poor allocation of resources—such as credit—the country’s 
economic outlook is favourable enough for the government to meet its goal of 
doubling China’s 2010 GDP and per-capita income by 2020. 


China recorded relatively rapid real GDP growth in the first half of this year, with 
output expanding by 6.9% y/y (chart 2). Accordingly, the economy will comfortably 
meet the government's official 2017 growth target of at least 6.5%. We expect 
output gains to be smaller over the coming quarters on the back of the waning 
base effect of public spending, which was up by 21% y/y in the first half of 2017. 
The robust growth momentum so far this year has supported social stability and 
created a favourable economic environment for the 19th National Congress of the 
Communist Party of China, which will commence on October 18, 2017. 


LEADERSHIP CHANGE TO SPUR STRUCTURAL REFORMS 


The 19th National Congress, which takes place only twice in a decade, marks the 
mid-point of President Xi Jinping’s 10-year term. The new composition of the 
Politburo Standing Committee—China’s top policymaking body—will be closely 
watched as up to five out of seven members of the committee are expected to 
retire this year due to the party’s unwritten age limits. The remaining two members 
are President Xi himself and Premier Li Keqiang. Among the expected retirees is 
President Xi’s close aide Wang Qishan who has been the leader of China’s 
rigorous anti-corruption campaign. The configuration of the new committee will 
determine how fast China’s economic liberalization will progress over the coming 
years. 


We expect to see somewhat faster progress on economic reforms following the 
party congress. Efforts will likely be focused on strengthening the banking 
system’s resilience—by improving risk management, bolstering the regulatory 
framework, promoting gradual deleveraging, increasing transparency, and 
managing the resolution of troubled loans—that is a reform priority before the 
economy can be liberalized further. It is also likely that policymakers will place

GLOBAL ECONOMICS 


| SCOTIABANK’S GLOBAL OUTLOOK 


less emphasis on achieving short-term real GDP growth targets and more on financial 
stability, given elevated risks stemming from continued rapid credit growth (chart 3) and 
China’s high corporate debt burden. Within the universe of banking system reforms, we 
believe that increasing the depth of the financial sector is a vital aspect of near-term 
structural changes as it would promote stronger capital flows into China and lessen 
pressure on the capital account that is currently curbed by tighter capital controls. 


In addition to financial sector reforms, we continue to pay attention to any progress 
made toward meeting China’s long-term goal of having markets play a “decisive role” in 
resource allocation. A key element of meeting this objective is faster advancement in 
reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which dominate the economy and tend to 
be less efficient than their private-sector counterparts. There are around one hundred 
massive SOE conglomerates in China, yet when their subsidiaries are included the 
number of nonfinancial companies climbs to 167,000. According to estimates by the 
International Monetary Fund, the productivity of Chinese SOE’s is 25% lower than in 
corresponding private companies. We expect to see further progress on consolidating 
SOEs, curtailing their losses, reducing their non-commercial functions, incorporating 
SOE subsidiaries, and opening some SOE-dominated sectors to private investment. 


PRUDENT AND NEUTRAL MONETARY POLICY TO BE MAINTAINED 


China’s monetary conditions are set to remain “prudent and neutral” over the coming 
months, according to the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). The country’s monetary 
policy has become more market-based in recent years and the central bank is now 
using the 7-day reverse repo rate as its de-facto policy rate to signal monetary policy 
intentions (yet officially the one-year loan and deposit rates are still the formal 
benchmark interest rates and are determined by China’s State Council). The 7-day rate 
has remained at 2.45% since March after it was increased by a total of 20 basis points 
in the first quarter of 2017. We expect monetary policy to be tightened cautiously in the 
latter part of the forecast horizon, yet conditions are set to remain relatively loose 
overall against the backdrop of slowing economic growth momentum. 


Price pressures remain well contained in China with headline inflation currently 
hovering below 2% y/y (chart 4). We expect only gradual strengthening in inflationary 
pressures over the coming quarters with the inflation rate reaching 272% y/y by the end 
of 2019. As part of China’s financial market liberalization efforts over the medium-term, 
the PBoC will likely move away from money growth targets toward inflation-targeting. 
Such transition will eventually improve monetary policy transparency and credibility, 
which are important prerequisites for successful internalization of the Chinese renminbi 
(CNY). In the meantime, we expect Chinese policymakers to increase exchange rate 
flexibility slightly. This is likely to happen through a wider CNY trading band around the 
PBoC’s reference rate; we believe that the existing +2% band may be enlarged— 
potentially to +3%—soon after the party congress.

Japan 
e Strong economic activity has yet to feed wage gains and inflation. 
e Politics dominate the near-term outlook. 


SOLID GROWTH AND LOW INFLATION 


Japan’s current economic activity is stronger and more broad-based than it has 
been in years. Real GDP growth averaged 112% y/y in the first half of the year 
(chart 1), driven by domestic demand, particularly household consumption and 
fixed investment. In addition, Japan’s external sector is responding to strengthening 
global demand and international trade, with net exports contributing to real GDP 
gains. We expect Japan’s economic growth to average 1.6% y/y in 2017, well 
above the nation’s potential growth rate of around 12% y/y. We estimate that output 
gains will be lower—and more sustainable—in 2018-19, averaging 0.9% y/y. 


Japan’s inflationary pressures remain low. Despite a tight labour market, higher 
corporate profits and a recent pick-up in business investment, wage increases 
remain muted (chart 2), questioning the sustainability of Japan’s recovery. Until 
we see solid wage gains, Japan’s inflation is set to stay low. In recent months 
price increases have hovered near 72% y/y. Should Japan’s consumption tax rate 
be hiked from 8% to 10% in October 2019 as currently planned, inflation will break 
the Bou’s 2% y/y inflation target in the final months of 2019, mimicking the price 
evolution after April 2014 when the tax rate was raised from 5% to 8% (chart 2). 
However, excluding this temporary impact, inflation will likely stay below the 2% 
mark in the foreseeable future. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is expected to maintain 
loose monetary policy through our forecast horizon. The short-term policy rate will 
likely remain at -0.1% and the Bou will continue to adjust the amount of its bond 
purchases depending on market developments, aiming to keep the 10-year 
government bond yield relatively close to 0%. While cautious alterations to the 
Bou’s asset purchase program are possible before the end of 2019, we do not 
expect the policy rate to be increased within our forecast horizon. 


JAPAN IN ELECTION MODE 


The economy’s favourable backdrop prompted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to call a 
snap election for October 22. The election for the House of Representatives (the 
lower house) was to be held by the end of 2018. Prime Minister Abe will be 
seeking to capitalize on stronger public support for his Liberal Democratic Party 
(LPD) and disarray in the opposition. Currently, the LPD and its coalition partner 
Komeito hold a two-thirds majority in the lower house. Renewing the solid 
mandate would allow the government to focus forcefully on structural reforms. 


The run-up to the election will likely be characterized by debates about Japan’s 
North Korea strategy and the revamping of the Japanese social security system 
against the backdrop of a rapidly aging society. In addition, Prime Minister Abe will 
be seeking a clear mandate to be able to move ahead with the second 
consumption tax rate increase in 2019. To gather support for the hike, he has 
signaled intentions for less fiscal consolidation, promising to direct the tax 
revenues to areas such as education and care services for the elderly.

various efforts to formalize the economy—will be growth-supportive over the

encourage private sector investment. Additionally, ongoing progress on cleaning P

POTENTIAL FISCAL BOOST FORBIDS MONETARY POLICY SUPPORT 


Responding to weak economic growth, the Indian government may consider new 
fiscal stimulus measures to underpin domestic demand. Speculation regarding a 
looser fiscal stance has triggered investor concerns about the sustainability of 
India’s fiscal position, which is already one of the economy’s weakest links. Until 
now, the administration had aimed to narrow the central government deficit to 3% 
of GDP by FY2018—19 (April-May). Any slippage from meeting the target could 
undermine India’s chances of receiving a sovereign credit rating upgrade from 
Moody’s, which currently holds a “positive” outlook on India’s “Baa3” rating.

Weak economic growth will likely increase pressure on the Reserve Bank of India

repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.0% following the August 1—2 monetary policy 
meeting on the back of benign inflationary developments (chart 2). Nevertheless, 
we expect the RBI’s monetary policy stance to remain unchanged in the near term 
given that the government may adopt a looser fiscal stance. On various 
occasions, the RBI has highlighted that potential fiscal slippage is one of the key 
risks to the country’s inflation outlook. Moreover, further benchmark interest rate oa 
reductions would likely have only a minimal impact on stimulating the economy 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

MONETARY NORMALIZATION IN THE CARDS FOR 2019 Soutees: Scotiabank Eeonomics, Bleomberg, 


The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will likely maintain accommodative 

monetary conditions over the coming quarters in order to support domestic 

demand, leaving the benchmark cash rate at the current level of 1.50%. The 

RBA’s policymakers have recently pointed out that the strength of the Australian 

dollar (chart 1) is expected to keep inflationary pressures low for the time being 

and weigh on the outlook for the nation’s output and employment. Nevertheless, 

we do not expect the Australian dollar to appreciate further in the near-term due to 

lower bulk commodities prices. Orit

The Australian labour market continues to strengthen gradually with full-time jobs

by strengthening non-mining investment growth and the fading adverse impact a eras 

from declining mining investment. While real wage increases are currently near 25

translate into modest wage pressures and demand-driven inflation. We estimate 5 

that the headline inflation rate will hover near the low end of the RBA’s 2-3% é 

inflation target range through 2018 and to climb slowly—but more sustainably— 

over the course of 2019, reaching 273% y/y by the end of the year. As a response a

GLOBAL ECONOMICS 
| SCOTIABANK’S GLOBAL OUTLOOK 


October 5, 2017 


=, Scotiabank’ 


Commodities 
FOLLOWING DIFFERENT PATHS ON A COMMON UPWARD HILL 


e Anaccelerating global economy and a weakening US dollar will provide 
a broadly supportive backdrop and buttress the ongoing recovery of 
industrial commodity prices. 


e Oil markets are rebalancing along prior expectations, though bearish 
sentiment will require further realized supply deficits for WTI prices to 
break above $55/bbl. 


e Industrial metals rallied together through Q3, but prices have since 
diverged and we expect metal-specific fundamentals to drive 
differentiated price performance through 2019. 


Global commodities are broadly forecast to gain ground through the 
forecast horizon but recovery paths are increasingly heterogeneous, both 
across sectors and within them. Energy markets are experiencing gradual, range- 
bound recoveries against volatile metals performance. While metals rallied 
together in the third quarter, prices are diverging again as individual fundamentals 
reassert control. These market-specific developments are occurring against a 
widely supportive backdrop, where an accelerating global economy is 
bolstering commodities demand and broad US dollar weakness is putting 
upward pressure on dollar-denominated contracts. Chinese industrial and 
environmental policy remain the key outlook risks, with the timing of stimulus 
withdrawal as well as the seriousness of supply-side and environmental efforts 
likely to keep the market guessing. On balance, we anticipate that most 
industrial commodities will continue to gain in year-over-year terms through 
the forecast horizon, though bulk commodities are expected to undergo a 
needed correction and precious metals prices are forecast to fall back ona 
higher rate environment (chart 1). 


ENERGY: BEARISH OIL SENTIMENT WILL REQUIRE DEEPER, SUSTAINED 
DEFICITS TO PROVE RECOVERY’S STAYING POWER 


The oil market is rebalancing much as expected but prices have lagged the 
gradual recovery occurring in the physical market, with still-high commercial 
inventories providing ample cover for bearish sentiment and tilting speculative 
price movements to the downside. Sentiment headwinds will slow the recovery in 
crude prices and are the primary reason for a modest $1—2/bbl decrease to our 
WTI crude price forecast to average $50/bblI in 2017, $52/bbl in 2018, and 
$56/bbl in 2019. However, we continue to see strengthening fundamentals (chart 
2) that will tilt medium-term risk to the upside and ultimately drive prices higher 
through end-decade, with supply deficits expected to reduce the overhang in 
OECD commercial inventories back to 5-year average levels by mid-2019. Our 
optimism is rooted in a less sanguine outlook for US production growth coupled 
with steady OPEC discipline and weak output through the rest of the world. 
Demand is expected to continue growing at an above-trend pace of roughly 1.5 
MMbpd y/y through 2019 given accelerating global growth and persistently low 
prices.

BASE METALS: DIVERGENT OUTLOOKS FOLLOWING COLLECTIVE Q3 RALLY 


Base metals markets experienced a collective third quarter rally, though prices 
have since diverged (chart 6) and metal-specific fundamentals are expected to 
drive individual performance through the forecast horizon. 


Copper’s recent volatility is surprising given a relatively balanced physical 
market compared with the supply situations in its sister base metals. Moderate 
surpluses over the past few years have weighed on copper but the recent uptick in 
Chinese industrial activity pushed “Dr. Copper’—so-called for the belief that the 
metal’s price reflects global industrial trends—into overdrive, leaping from lows near 
$2/lb last year to recent highs above $3.15/lb. Copper’s fundamentals have tightened 
modestly since our last outlook but not nearly enough to justify recent price gains, and 
promising drawdowns of copper inventories proved to be a false start after fresh 
deliveries to LME sheds have left exchanges well-stocked (chart 7). The completion 
of new mines as well the expansion of legacy mines, primarily in Chile, Zambia, 
and the DRC will tilt the market back to small surpluses over the forecast 
horizon, but an emptying of that mine capacity pipeline is expected to push 
prices to average $2.85/Ib in 2018 and $3.00/Ib in 2019. 


The nickel market is experiencing growing supply deficits, but price 
performance is inhibited by a significant inventory overhang stemming from a 
decade of oversupply. A gradual reduction of these inventories is forecast to put 
soft upward pressure on nickel prices, which are expected to average $4.65/Ib in 
2017, $5.00/Ib in 2018, and $5.50/Ib in 2019. Our outlook assumes that mines 
shuttered under Philippine environmental audits are restarted, but slow progress on 
that front tips our forecast risk to the upside, with less Philippine supply leading to 
more aggressive stock drawdowns and thus a steeper upward price path. 


Zinc continues to enjoy the strongest fundamentals within the base metals complex 
and supply tightness is expected to push prices higher than today’s already-inflated 
levels, averaging $1.50/Ib in 2018 and peaking at $1.60/Ib in 2019. Initially, these high 
prices had released a new wave of supply—primarily from Chinese mines—and had 
spooked the market but those supply gains have evaporated (chart 8), putting zinc back on 
our assumed path toward acute tightness over the next two years. However, we anticipate 
that prices in the $1.50—1.60/lb range will be sufficient to incentivize new mine supply onto 
the market and prices are expected to gradually come back down from 2019 onward. This 
downtrend from cycle highs will be amplified by the likely demand destruction that will occur 
as manufacturers shift to other, less zinc-intensive galvanizing processes. Future supply 
gains are expected to come largely from China and Australia, with additional new mine 
supply expected from South Africa, India, Peru, and Mexico. 


The aluminium market remains on edge as participants await the onset of the 
much-telegraphed winter capacity cutbacks which, when combined with recent 
government moves to shutter inefficient smelting capacity, have pushed prices 
to five-year highs near $1/lb as fears of supply shortage incentivize prompt 
buying. However, the aluminium market appears fundamentally balanced absent 
significant and sustained policy action out of Beijing, and ultimate price levels will be 
determined by how much capacity is affected in China, for how long, and what prices 
are needed by ex-Chinese smelters to profitably restart idled plants. We expect 
aluminium prices to average $0.90/Ib through 2019, but risks are on the upside 
given the potential for deeper, longer environmental policy action in China.

BULK COMMODITIES: ENJOY THESE PRICES WHILE THEY LAST 


Bulk commodities like iron ore and coking coal have continued to surprise on 
the upside after receiving a demand jolt from newly profitable Chinese steel 
mills (chart 9), which increased imports of raw materials and strained seaborne 
supply. Stimulus has kept steel demand high at the same time that the government 
has been closing inefficient “illegal” smelting capacity, reducing domestic supply. This 
current market tightness is further exacerbated by China’s looming winter capacity 
cutbacks, which have prompted affected mills to increase production today in hopes 
of offsetting forced idling between October and March; this intertemporal demand 
shifting has benefitted bulk commodities recently but will weigh on prices through the 
winter months as steel production and thus the need for imported feedstock falls 
away. Iron ore prices are expected to average $60/t through the forecast period, 
the upper end of the seaborne cost curve and more than sufficient to bring enough 
ore to market given a less compressed demand schedule. Hard coking coal (HCC) 
prices are expected to see a similar downtrend toward marginal pricing following this 
past year’s roller coaster, which saw HCC gyrate between $150 and $310 per tonne 
on an assortment of supply-side constraints. HCC prices are expected to fall to 
$150/t in 2018 and $130/t in 2019 barring further weather-related supply 
tightness. 


PRECIOUS METALS: GOLD RANGEBOUND ON WEAK DOLLAR, HIGHER RATES 


The price of gold remains elevated after briefly breaching $1,350/oz in 
September, its highest level of the year, on falling market expectations of 
interest rate hikes in the US, a weakening US dollar, and heightened 
geopolitical risk concerns related to mounting rhetorical volleys between 
Washington and Pyongyang (chart 10). Despite these bullish gold factors, we 
believe that the market is currently underpricing the likelihood of further tightening by 
the US Federal Reserve later this year. We forecast that the US Fed will hike in 
December and as such gold will face dual headwinds, with gold expected to weaken 
on a higher real rate path as well as a temporarily stronger US dollar. Following this 
adjustment, we believe that gold will average $1,300/oz in 2018 and 2019. 
Anticipated continued US dollar weakness after a brief fourth quarter rebound is 
expected to provide gold with upward support and mitigate the downside pressure 
from a rising rate environment globally.

Eurozone growth momentum remains strong, which will limit near-term EUR weakness, but political risks remain obvious and a 
potential restraint on gains into mid-2018 (regional independence issues, Italy’s general election has to be held by May of 2018). 
The ECB is edging closer to the end of its asset purchase programme, however, and we expect the eventual normalization of 
monetary policy to allow investors to refocus on one of the EUR’s key structural supports—its large current account surplus 
relative to the US. We also note that global central banks retain a low relative and absolute exposure to the EUR in reserve asset 
holdings and large, institutional investors may have to adjust exposure to the EUR as growth strengthens and the ECB exits from 
extra-ordinary policy accommodation. We look for modest strength in the EUR next year and more obvious gains into 2019 as a 
result. 


Our GBP forecast has been upgraded to reflect our call for the BoE to tighten monetary policy later this year in response to high 
domestic inflation. We expect only a slow tightening in policy, however, with a second hike unlikely before mid-2018—we think 
May. But considering that few major central banks are even close to raising benchmark rates, even a slight increase in the 
benchmark rate will help lift the GBP broadly. Brexit remains a risk in the GBP’s background but, assuming no significant changes 
on the domestic political front, we also think a lot of bad news has already been factored in to the GBP at current levels and we 
rather view the GBP as looking quite cheap still from a longer-term valuation perspective. 


The JPY will underperform broadly in the coming year. Domestic growth trends remain weak and the BoJ remains far from 
achieving its 2% inflation goal. This means policy accommodation remaining in place for an extended period as other central banks 
prepare to exit extra-ordinary accommodation or nudge policy tighter. Relatively weaker growth and accommodative monetary 
policy settings will weigh on the JPY. We expect the USD to trade up to the 120 area through late-2019 but longer-term charts 
suggest a risk of more rapid USD appreciation in the medium term if the USD pushes through the 115 area on a sustained basis in 
the next couple of quarters. 


It may still be a bit premature to start worrying about the impact of LATAM elections on FX, outside of Chile, which is holding its 
elections in November. Most polls and analysts believe that former President Pifera is likely going to win the election, although 
there is also uncertainty about whether he will be able to secure a large enough legislative coalition to push forward his agenda, 
which investors seem to like. Accordingly, over the coming weeks, we expect the Chilean peso will react to polls and what they 
suggest about the legislative composition. In Colombia, fiscal concerns are one of the drivers of recent softness not only in the 
Colombian peso (COP), but also domestic rates, meaning comments from rating agencies and fiscal and growth numbers should 
be the major drivers of the COP’s price action. Our take is that COP is now somewhat “cheap” from a fundamental perspective 
(about 5%-—10%), but volatility is likely from both fiscal/growth considerations (short term), as well as electoral campaigns (starting 
early 2018). On the electoral front, we expect both Uribe & Santos aligned candidates to be seen as positive by markets (macro 
policy continuity). In Mexico, the three factors that should determine price action are likely to be: inflation and monetary policy, 
NAFTA negotiations, and the 2018 elections. We expect NAFTA and monetary policy to be the key drivers in the near term, while 
elections should kick in as a major driver early in 2018. However, there are still some aspects of the elections that markets need to 
be mindful off right now, namely who the main parties select as their candidates. We expect those candidates to start emerging 
late October—mid-November. On NAFTA, even though we expect the final outcome will be positive, it should still be a volatility 
driver as issues of contention emerge. Our take is that the Mexican peso (MXN) remains about 5% undervalued. However, even 
though it is cheap, we expect uncertainty related to the NAFTA renegotiation and the 2018 elections to keep the peso on its back 
foot. Peruvian markets seem to be increasingly immune to the domestic political drama playing out, with the reaction to President 
PPK’s cabinet shuffle being quite modest. Behind this market stability, is the view that Peru has already undertaken a lot of the key 
reforms, meaning that as long as we have a functional government, risks are relatively modest. 


Asian EM FX will trade in line with risk sentiment over the remainder of the year. External uncertainties including the stance of the 
ECB, US macro data, the US debt ceiling issue, US tax reforms as well as geopolitical risks are all issues that may affect regional 
FX into year end. 


The Chinese yuan (CNY)’s implied volatility has been rising along with the sliding risk reversal since late August. A neutral risk 
reversal has paved the way for the regulators to increase two-way flexibility in the yuan exchange rate and push for reforms, such 
as a wider trading band. The China Finance 40 Forum (CF40), a Beijing-based quasi-governmental think tank, said in a report that 
it is a good time now for China to carry out further FX reforms and the nation should allow the yuan to become more flexible.

Meanwhile, the PBoC is expected to properly manage market expectations ahead of the ruling party’s 19th national congress and 
US President Trump’s visit to China scheduled for early November. 


We see downside potential for the Indian rupee (INR) in the weeks ahead on rising concern over domestic stimulus plans and 
possible unwinding of long INR carry position. USD/INR is likely to head for the 66.0 mark. In the medium term, the INR will recoup 
its losses when the market is convinced of the proposed stimulus package’s ability to prop up economic growth. 


The Korean won (KRW) remains susceptible to downward pressure related to the geopolitical situation on the Peninsula. We are 
closely monitoring the Taiwanese dollar (TWD) and expect USD/TWD to rise towards the 30.5 level should stock outflows 
continue. The Thai baht (THB) will trade along with a broader market tone but outperform somewhat given the nation’s solid 
fundamentals. The BoT has committed to intervening intermittently to curb an excessively strong THB—the best performing 
currency this year in the region.
