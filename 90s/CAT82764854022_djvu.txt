FROM THE EDITOR 


As we approach the Spring of 1990, an estimated 
1.1 million acres are scheduled to be sprayed for 
gypsy moth control in the Northeast and Michigan. 
An average treatment cost of $15 per acre means 
that roughly 15 million dollars will be spent by States 
and the Federal government for this year’s treat- 
ment. In some ways, this figure reflects the impor- 
tance that government (and therefore society) 
places upon controlling this pest. | can think of sev- 
eral reasons for this high degree of importance: 1) 
The gypsy moth, unlike some other forest pests, is 
a problem that affects a lot of people. People place 
a high priority on the trees in their yards, along their 
streets, and in their parks and greenways. Since the 
gypsy moth can dramatically alter our urban tree 
environment, it has become a pest that strikes an 
important chord in the values of many people. 2) As 
the statistic on this issue’s cover relates, the gypsy 
moth also threatens an important oak resource in 
the Northeast. Maybe threatening a resource is a 
little overdramatic, but the pest does impose seri- 
ous timber management implications for those who 
make a living growing and selling oak timber. 3) The 
final reason is the millions of caterpillars that can 
invade residential areas during a gypsy moth out- 
break. This is one concern we hear over and over 
again from homeowners. This is the nuisance part of 
gypsy moth and it is a concern that can rally a 
neighborhood into action faster than many other 
neighborhood concerns. 


What about the cure? Is the cure worse than the 
problem? There is no small amount of concern over 
how we treat this problem. At present, treating a 
million acres means that pesticides will be aerially 
sprayed over forests, parks, and forested residential 
areas. Right in the middle of all this sits State and 
Federal agencies responsible for making decisions 
that alleviate the problem while protecting the envi- 
ronment. It is because of these environmental con- 
cerns that these same agencies struggle to find the 
safest and most effective means to control the gyp- 
sy moth. These efforts have led to new materials 
being developed such as the virus Gypchek, or the 
mating disruption material Disrupt®. These are new 
attempts to solve the problem while minimizing ef- 
fects upon the environment. 


As we move into the 1990’s, and the gypsy moth 
continues to move west and south, this balancing 


act between the problem and the cure will grow 
more evident. And, as it does, our desire to find the 
perfect balance will also grow. 


This issue focuses upon a subject often overlooked 
by pest management specialists--What to do with 
the dead trees. And, of all places the gypsy moth 
seems to have found a home--in Utah!

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 


Roy G. Hatcher, lowa Department of Natural Re- 
sources, writes: 


"| am including a copy of the final report on 
lowa’s first gypsy moth control project. | 
thought it might be of interest to your read- 
ers to see how a midwestern State copes 
with its first gypsy moth infestation." 


We have been surveying for gypsy moth in lowa 
since 1973 and we are very aware of what the con- 
sequences might be if we allow the gypsy moth to 
get established in lowa. We had more detections 
this year than we ever had and are aware that we will 
be having more infestations show up in our State. 


Location of Treatment Area: A portion of the Mill- 
crest residential area in southwest Clinton, lowa. 


Area Treated: 9 acres. 
Material Used: Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki 
marketed under the Sandoz Crop Protection trade 


name SAN 415. 


Application Rate: 64 0z. SAN 415 in 100 gallons of 
water applied to all host foliage per acre. 


Dates and Number of Applications: Three (May 16, 
May 25, and June 6, 1989). 


Kind of Equipment Used: One John Bean hydraulic 
sprayer and four hand operated sprayers. 


Discussion: The effectiveness of the treatment, as 
indicated by the results of the 1989 trapping sea- 


41 


son, indicates the work was successful. High den- 
sity trapping was conducted in the Millcrest residen- 
tial area. Traps were inspected at frequent intervals 
during the prime recovery period and at regular 
intervals with other traps the remainder of the sea- 
son. No positive recoveries were made. 


Mr. K. Rhody of the Pennsylvania Bureau of 
Forestry, writes: 


"Are household cleaning products effec- 
tive at destroying egg masses?" 


Thomas Odell, aresearch entomologist with the US- 
DA Forest Service, responds: 


"The use of household cleaning products 
containing pine oil may be effective at killing 
overwintering (diapausing) larvae in egg 
masses, but to my knowledge, it has not 
been tested scientifically. While laboratory 
testing could quickly evaluate the conse- 
quences of painting or spraying household 
cleaning products on egg masses, it would 
be more difficult to determine the potential 
phytotoxicity to plant tissue if it was sprayed 
or painted on bark. Since most cleaning 
products have excellent penetrating capabili- 
ties they may reach important plant tissues, 
killing plant cells as well as gypsy moth." 


"Another consideration in trying to reduce 
gypsy moth populations by destroying egg 
masses is the potential for actually effecting 
population reduction. There is no evidence 
that scraping or painting egg masses by 
hand contributes to reducing the impact of 
gypsy moth. When you can easily find egg 
masses to treat, there are just to many out-of- 
reach or out-of-sight to make your efforts 
worthwhile (aside from the satisfaction of 
eliminating a few nasties). In addition, scrap- 
ing egg masses or spraying or painting them 
with materials not registered for use against 
gypsy moth may be dangerous to your 
health and/or the plant’s. Egg masses are 
covered with fine hairs (setae), deposited 
around the eggs by their mother. They have 
known allergenic properties; they should not 
be handled without gloves, breathing the 
hairs should be avoided, and eyes should be 


protected. In short, be forewarned that trying 
to destroy egg masses, while noble, may be 
hazardous to plant tissue and you!" 


UTAH GYPSY MOTH PROGRAM

Ogden, Utah 84401 


The gypsy moth appeared in Utah in 1988. Follow- 
ing the initial find of five male moths on the Univer- 
sity of Utah campus, an intensive delimiting pro- 
gram was initiated in the Salt Lake City area near the 
Wasatch Mountains. Gypsy moth pheromone traps 
extended southward to Provo and north to Brigham 
City. Of the 1,737 traps placed in the field, 114 
recorded multiple catches. The final male moth 
catch in 1988 was 1,292. Over 90 percent of the 
male moths caught were collected southeast of Salt 
Lake City. Because populations of the insect were 
not discovered until late July, delimitation trapping 
of the adult male moths was not adequate to de- 
scribe treatment boundaries. Therefore, the treat- 
ment program conducted in 1989 was based on the 
finds of other life stages (egg masses and pupal 
cases). Many of the male moths captured within the 
Salt Lake area were thought to be artifacts of the 
core infestation. 


Based on the results of the egg mass survey a 
1,200-acre block was designated for treatment in 
1989. An area less than 1 acre in size, had egg mass 
numbers exceeding 4,000 egg masses/acre. Three 
applications of Bt (Dipel 8L at 96 oz./acre, 16 BIU’s) 
were used to suppress the gypsy moth populations 
within the treatment block. Pre- and post-spray lar- 
val and egg mass counts were made to determine 
spray effectiveness. Seven days following the last 
application, larval counts indicated a 95 percent 
reduction in larval numbers. Egg mass counts con- 
ducted in the fall of 1989, indicated a 98 percent 
reduction in egg mass numbers within the 10 sites 
surveyed. Pre-spray egg mass counts ranged from 
0 to 4,240 egg masses per acre; post-spray counts 
ranged from 0 to 80 egg masses per acre. 


Increased public awareness of the gypsy moth in 
Utah also led to the discovery of two isolated popu- 


lations in Bountiful and Provo, Utah. As a result of 
the late finds, ground applications of Orthene were 
made on 4th and 5th instar larvae within the affected 
sites. Milk carton traps were placed within the three 
treatment areas at densities of 4-8/acre depending 
on vegetation types present. 


Based on the 1989 pheromone trap results, 13 treat- 
ment blocks totaling 20,064 acres have been desig- 
nated for treatment in the 1990 aerial eradication 
program. The 13 blocks are scattered along the 
Wasatch Front in Utah, Davis, and Salt Lake Coun- 
ties. Three applications of Bt (24 BIU’s) will be ap- 
plied undiluted at 7-10 day intervals. The first appli- 
cation should begin the first week in May. As a result 
of the trapping data, the quarantine boundary has 
also been expanded to encompass 150,000 acres 
in the 3-county area. Trapping intensity has more 
than doubled from the 1989 program. Over 11,500 
pheromone traps will be used in the detection and 
delimiting programs in 1990. 


Many obstacles have to be overcome to ensure the 
success of the eradication program. Terrain, weath- 
er, and phenological development of both host and 
insect make this a challenging program. Excellent 
cooperation between agencies has enabled quick 
and effective action to deal with the problems this 
pest presents, not only to Utah but to most of the 
intermountain west.

GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING 
THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY 
OF SALVAGING GYPSY MOTH

INTRODUCTION 


Since the introduction of the gypsy moth to the 
United States in 1869, the pest has become estab- 
lished in the northeastern United States from Maine 
to northern Virginia. Practically all forest stands in 
the Northeast are susceptible to gypsy moth defoli- 
ation. Stands containing oaks of all types, birch and 
aspen are particularly vulnerable. 


Although defoliation is an important measure in pre- 
dicting the extent of tree mortality in a stand, other 
factors such as stand and site characteristics and 
composition, and invasion of types of insects and 
fungi have an overall influence on tree mortality. The 
challenge to managers and planners is not only to 
estimate defoliation and mortality, but to also deter- 
mine which stands are economical to harvest. 


Generally, pulping and lumber recovery studies 
suggest that pulp and lumber can be recovered 
from gypsy moth-killed trees, provided the trees 
were harvested within a period of 1 to 3 years of the 
trees’ death. 


Although pulping and recovery studies have been 
conducted, mortality estimators developed, and sil- 
vicultural guidelines to minimize losses document- 
ed, a need exists for evaluating which stands will be 
economical to salvage. A rigorous financial analysis 
must be conducted using accurate estimates of log- 
ging cost for alternative logging technologies. The 
logging costs need to be integrated with wood value 


4 


estimates to determine what is economical to sal- 
vage and what is not. Accordingly, in this report, a 
methodology and guidelines are documented pro- 
viding estimates that can be used to determine 
which stands are economically feasible to harvest. 


ESTIMATING LOGGING COSTS 


Stump-to-mill logging cost estimates were devel- 
oped for salvaging gypsy moth killed hardwoods for 
cable and ground-based logging systems. The cost 
estimates were developed using ECOST and EAST- 
COST. ECOST and EASTCOST are microcomputer 
programs that can be used to estimate the stump- 
to-mill cost of cable and ground-based logging in 
the mountainous terrain in the Eastern United 
States. Stand data used were from 574 sample 
1/10-acre plots established in Pennsylvania in 1978 
before the gypsy moth infestation of the 1980's. 
Cumulative tree mortality was annually measured 
from 1979 to 1985 on all plots. Table 1 represents 
what is potentially possible in salvaging dead hard- 
wood trees. The specific logging technologies eval- 
uated included the Clearwater cable yarder for 
steep terrain applications and a John Deere 540B 
skidder for moderate to gentle terrain. Both of these 
machines are representative of cable and ground- 
based logging technology. The transportation haul 
distances evaluated ranged from 20 to 60 miles. 


ESTIMATING WOOD VALUE 


Three levels of delivered prices for sawlog and 
pulpwood/fuelwood by oak species were used-- 
high, medium, and low (Table 2). The range of price 
levels between the product classes in Table 2 was 
obtained from Forest Products Price Bulletins. Only 
sawlog and pulpwood products were evaluated as 
these are the products most likely to be salvaged 
from gypsy moth-killed trees. Veneer logs were not 
treated, since log buyers generally were reluctant to 
purchase veneer logs from dead standing or 
downed timber. 


Figure 1 shows the relative revenue Curves by price 
level and average cut-tree d.b.h. for red oak and a 
fixed volume removal of 2,000 cubic feet. The rev- 
enue curves rise sharply in the range of 12- to 
13-inch average tree d.b.h. This is due to the fact 
that as trees get larger, more medium and large 
sawlogs are produced. Larger logs fetch higher 
price levels. 


ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY 


Figure 2 shows the relative revenue differences for 
red, white, chestnut, scarlet, and black oak. Eco- 
nomic feasibility can be determined by focusing on 
the intersections of the cost and revenue curves 
(Figure 1). Each intersection defines the minimum 
average d.b.h. that is economically feasible for the 
specified cost and revenue assumptions. These in- 
tersections define break-even salvage harvest con- 
ditions. Conditions beyond these break-even points 
represent what is profitable in salvaging gypsy moth 
killed hardwoods. For example, stands containing 
trees that average 10-inch d.b.h. can be salvaged 
using ground-based technology when the haul is 20 
miles or less (Figure 1). In contrast, stands must 
contain trees that average at least 11.5- to 12-inch 
d.b.h. and be within a short 20-mile haul to be eco- 
nomical when using cable logging technology. Fig- 
ure 1 is specific to red oak and a fixed volume re- 
moval of 2,000 cubic feet. 


SELECTING SALVAGEABLE STANDS 


The data and methodology mentioned above were 
used to develop economic feasibility matrices for 
red, white, chestnut, scarlet, and black oak (Figures 
3 through 9). 


The major differences in Figures 3-9 are the interac- 
tive effects of logging technology, species, price 
levels, and haul distances on the economic feasibil- 
ity of harvesting a particular stand. For example, 
stands containing primarily red oak trees that aver- 
age 13 inches d.b.h. (Figure 3), 1,500 ft? volume 
removal, using cable logging technology, with 
60-mile haul distances, are economically feasible to 
harvest at high, medium, and low prices. In contrast, 
similar combinations of logging technology, volume 
removal, and haul distance for stands consisting of 
white oak trees (Figure 4), 60-mile hauls are only 
economical at the high price level. Since the combi- 
nations of logging technology and haul distance 
remain the same, the difference in economic feasi- 
bility in this case is due to the difference in prices for 
red and white oak products. 


Another major difference in Figures 3-9 is the impact 
of the interaction of logging technology and volume 
harvested on the economic feasibility of harvesting 
a stand. For example, stands consisting of chestnut 


oak trees, using cable logging technology (Figure 
5) are economical if the trees average at least 12 
inches d.b.h., with at least 1,500 ft? of volume, high 
price levels, and be within 20 miles to a mill. For 
similar species, prices, haul combinations, using 
ground-based technology (Figure 9), stands con- 
taining trees that average at least 10 inches d.b.h. 
and 2,500 ft* of volume can be harvested if the price 
level is high and the stand is located within 20 miles 
of a mill. 


Managers, planners, landowners, and loggers can 
use these matrices to help determine what stands 
are profitable to salvage. For example: a landowner 
is looking to salvage a stand with heavy mortality, 
trees averaging 10 inches d.b.h., volume of 3,000 
cubic feet, primarily scarlet oak, on moderate 
ground. He/she would enter the matrices in Figures 
6 and 8, since the stand could be logged with either 
logging technology. From Figure 6, cable logging 
this stand simply would not be economical. From 
Figure 8, ground-based logging this stand would be 
economically feasible if the haul distance to the mill 
was less than or equal to 20 miles and only at high- 
price levels. Other evaluations would follow similar 
logic. 


The methodology described here could be linked to 
inventory or stand data bases to determine which 
stands have salvage potential and also to develop 
salvage guidelines. The focus on management then 
could be restricted to those stands offering the most 
potential. In practice, this analysis could be repeat- 
ed as often as necessary to include changes in 
product markets, prices, harvesting technology, or 
silvicultural objectives. 


CONSIDERATIONS FOR MANAGERS 


Logging costs decreased with increasing average 
cut-tree d.b.h. 


The most profitable stands will be those with high 
volumes, valuable species mix, have trees with 
grade logs, on gentle ground, salvageable by 
ground-based systems, and close hauls to the mill. 


The trees should be salvaged, if possible, before 
they die; but if they were dead, they should be 
salvaged within 1 year to minimize pulpwood and 
lumber recovery losses. 


Submarginal salvage efforts may be packaged with 
more profitable stands into one economical harvest. 
In stands with low volumes of dead material, thin- 
ning of live trees can be used to increase the volume 
and value of the logging operation to make it more 
profitable. Methods such as those summarized here 
can be linked to existing inventory data bases to 
evaluate candidate stands for salvage operations. 


Although these guidelines include only two types of 
logging technology, three levels of market price, 
and transport mileage, one can easily evaluate oth- 
er scenarios with the methodology presented by 
simply making additional simulation runs.
