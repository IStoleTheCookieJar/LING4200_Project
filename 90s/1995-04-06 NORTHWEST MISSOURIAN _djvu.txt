Singing  birds,  a  hen  that  lays  golden 
eggs,  and  a  cow  that  had  trouble  dying  and 
giving  milk,  kept  the  audience  laughing 
once  they  were  “Into  the  Woods”  Wednes¬ 
day  night  at  the  Mary  Linn  Performing 
Arts  Center. 

The  play  continues  tonight  through 
Saturday  at  7:30  p.m.,  with  an  additional 
matinde  at  2  p.m.  Sunday.  Tickets  are  $8 
for  orchestra  and  $6  for  balcony. 

After  the  opening  night’s  show,  many 
cast  members  said  they  believed  the  musi¬ 
cal  was  a  success  because  the  cast  worked 


so  closely  together  as  a  team. 

“I  hope  we  can  keep  our  energy  level  up 
and  have  fun  along  with  the  audience 
without  having  any  major  let  downs,”  Jill 
Newland,  Cinderella,  said. 

Newland’s  roommate,  Michelle 
Neuerburg,  played  theBaker’s  Wife.  How¬ 
ever,  on  Monday  Neuerburg  suddenly 
came  down  with  a  tonsil  infection,  but  still 
performed  Wednesday  with  a  sometimes 
soft  voice. 

“My  voice  is  so-so  and  it  is  hard  be¬ 
cause  I  want  to  sing  out  but  I  can’t  because 
I  have  to  save  my  voice,”  Neuerburg  said 
in  a  hoarse  whisper  after  opening  night.  “I 
feel  better  now  than  I  have  so  far.” 


Othercast  members  were  also  pleased 
with  the  first  night’s  performance. 

“We  have  the  best  cast  ever  and  we 
had  a  blast,"  said  Cara  Gitto,  who  played 
Little  Red  Riding  Hood.  “I  enjoyed  my 
role  because  it  was  really  not  different 
from  myself.” 

Audience  members  got  a  thrill  out  of 
the  musical  as  well. 

“I  thought  the  show  was  excellent,” 
Heidi  Price  said.  “I  enjoyed  the  music, 
songs,  the  dance,  Little  Red  Riding  Hood 
and  the  Witch.”

Local  taverns 
face  charges 


By  CHRIS  TRIEBSCH 

Chief  Reporter 


In  an  ironic  set  of  circumstances  considering  the 
heated  issue  of  over/under  nights,  two  Maryville 
taverns  are  being  reprimanded  by  the  State  for  serv¬ 
ing  minors. 

The  Outback  and  T.O.’s  have  each  received  one- 
week  license  suspensions  from  the  Missouri  Divi¬ 
sion  of  Liquor  Control  for  numerous  counts  of  sell¬ 
ing  liquor  to  minors  and  liquor  consumption  by 
minors  in  those  bars. 

T.O.’s  had  seven  counts  of  consumption  by  mi¬ 
nors  and  three  counts  of  supplying  minors.  The 
Outback  had  six  counts  of  consumption  by  minors. 
The  department  issued  these  charges  Monday. 

Trent  Stringer,  owner  of  the  Outback,  is  appeal¬ 
ing  this  decision.  A  special  appeal  hearingon  the 
matter  is  scheduled  for  June. 

Stringer  said  these  charges  are  the  first  made 
against  the  Outback,  and  he  has  reported  minors  who 
have  attempted  to  consume  alcohol  to  authorities  in 
the  past. 

But  one  minor,  who  declined  to  give  her  name, 
said  she  had  been  served  alcohol  in  the  Outback  and 
also  knows  of  other  minors  who  have  been  served. 

T.O.’s  suspension  will  begin  May  1,  state  liquor 
authorities  said.  Terry  Oglesby,  owner  of  T.O.’s,  has 
not  commented  on  the  charges  but  has  said  he  favors 
an  ordinance  restricting  minors  from  the  Maiyville 
taverns. 

These  suspensions  come  at  a  time  when  some 
residents  and  officials  of  Maryville  are  trying  to  get 
an  ordinance  to  keep  minors  completely  out  of  bars. 

The  Outback  is  one  of  the  two  Maryville  bars  that 
offer  over/under  nights.  Minors  are  allowed  in  the 
bars  for  entertainment  on  these  nights  but  not  for 
consuming  alcohol. 

It  is  not  yet  known  if  the  bars  will  completely  shut 
down  for  the  week  or  remain  open  without  serving 
alcohol.

VPAA  to  take  office  Monday 


By  CHRIS  TRIEBSCH 

Chief  Reporter 

A  period  of  transition  will  soon  be 
upon  Northwest  as  the  University  pre¬ 
pares  for  the  arrival  of  the  new  vice 
president  for  Academic  Affairs. 

Tim  Gilmour,  the  new  VPAA,  will 
arrive  and  take  office  Monday .  He  will 
also  be  moving  into  his  temporary  new 
home,  Phillips  Hall. 

Frances  Shipley,-  interim  dean  of 
faculty  and  instruction,  will  step  down 
from  her  position  at  that  time  and 
return  to  her  old  post  as  graduate  dean . 
Shipley  plans  to  clean  out  her  office 
Saturday,  so  Gilmour  can  move  in 
immediately  after  his  arrival. 

This  transition  marks  an  end  to  a 
two-year  struggle  to  fill  the  position. 
There  has  not  been  a  permanent  VPAA 
since  Robert  Culbertson  left  in  June 
1993  to  accept  the  job  as  chancellor  of 
the  University  of  Wisconsin- 
Platteville. 

Patt  VanDyke,  now  dean  of  Owens 
library,  took  charge  of  the  VPAA  po¬ 
sition  on  an  interim  basis  immediately 
after  Culbertson’s  departure.  She  had 
previously  served  as  assistant  vice 
president  for  Academic  Affairs,  a  po¬ 
sition  that  no  longer  exists  at  North¬ 
west. 

VanDyke  said  she  had  some  reser-

Speaker  pushes  quality  instruction

MYRON  TRIBUS  STRESSES  the  Importance  of 
Instructor/student  Interaction.  The  Interactive 
classroom  allows  more  creative  thinking. 


Have  you  ever  walked  in  a  classroom  to  find  the 
instructor  informing  you  that  you  would  be  making  the 
syjlabus?  This  is  just  one  of  the  many  ideas  that  were 
discussed  at  the  Quality  Classroom  Wednesday. 

The  Quality  Classroom  came  about  because  of  a 
presentation  in  January  by  Myron  Tribus,  a  specialist 
inquality  managementand  consulting  engineer.  Many 
of  the  faculty  said  they  were  very  impressed  by  some 
of  the  ideas  generated  and  opted  to  have  a  campus¬ 
wide  event  for  faculty  and  students. 

Tribus  came  back  and  presented  a  session  at  the 
Quality  Classroom  along  with  Samuel  Welch  from 
Xavier  University  and  Kathleen  O’Brien,  academic 
dean  at  Alvemo  College  in  Milwaukee. 

The  Quality  Classroom  was  intended  to  generate 
ideas  about  how  to  get  students  interested  in  learning. 

Tribus  tookquestions  and  stories  from  the  people  in 
his  sessions  and  offered  advice. 

He  told  instructors  they  should  stir  up  students’ 
interest  by  letting  them  apply  what  they  have  learned.

Greeks  to  promote  community  service 


By  JASON  CISPER 

Missourian  Staff 


This  year’s  Greek  Weekend  theme,  "Never  Underesti¬ 
mate  the  Power  of  Greeks,”  is  proving  to  be  more  than  just  a 
slogan. 

Service  projects,  friendly  competition  and  Greek  unity  are 
only  a  few  items  on  the  agenda  for  this  year’ s  Greek  Weekend, 
which  will  take  place  tonight  through  Sunday. 

"It’s  a  time  for  Greeks  on  campus  to  draw  attention  to 
themselves  in  a  positive  light,”  Kent  Porterfield,  Inter-Frater¬ 
nity  Council  adviser,  said.  “During  this  weekend,  they  can 
portray  what  they’re  most  proud  of  —  their  leadership  and 
service  to  the  community.” 

Service  projects  for  this  year’s  Greek  Weekend  include  a 
chanty  car  wash,  collection  of  canned  goods,  a  clothing  drive 
and  a  new  paint  job  for  the  Maryville  Health  Care  Center. 

‘The  week  is  special  because  of  the  time  we  make  for  one 
another  to  unite  the  combination  of  individual  organizations’ 


abilities,  enthusiasm,  power  and  spirit  to  benefit  the  philan¬ 
thropy,"  Nancy  Lippert,  weekend  co-chair,  said. 

Greek  Weekend  is  not  all  work,  however.  Greek  games 
are  a  big  part  of  the  celebration.  They  begin  with  the  chariot 
race  today  and  continue  through  the  weekend,  and  some 
games  are  more.competitive  than  others. 

“We  take  the  chariot  race  pretty  seriously ,’’  Beau  Schlomer, 
Alpha  Kappa  Lambda  member,  said.  “We’ve  got  our  best 
men  on  the  team.” 

Sunday  will  wind  up  the  weekend’s  festivities  with  an 
awards  ceremony  at  6:30  p.m.  in  the  Union  Ballroom. 

During  this  time,  individuals  and  Greek  organizations 
will  be  recognized  for  their  efforts  throughout  the  academic 
year.  The  more  prestigious  awards  include  "Outstanding 
Greek  Organization,"  “Outstanding  Greek  President”  and 
“Most  Greek  Participation.” 

In  addition,  juniors  and  seniors  who  have  been  active  in 
the  Greek  system  will  be  asked  to  join  the  Order  of  Omega 
—  an  honor  society  for  fraternity  and  sorority  members.

Campus  Voice 


Why  do  yoopiink 
f|eople  mol 


With  classes  within  walking  distance,  most  of  the 
comforts  of  home  and  meals  like  mother  used  to  make, 
on-campus  living  is  more  appealing  than  ever.  But  if 
there  are  so  many  advantages  to  living  in  the  residence 
halls,  why  is  Perrin  Hall  closing  its  doors? 

The  cold,  harsh  reality  is  that  the  on-campus  popu¬ 
lation  has  decreased  considerably  over  the  last  three 
years.  The  number  of  students  living  on  campus  has 
dropped  to  below  2,000  this  spring,  nearly  800  less 
than  their  capacity. 

The  fact  is  that  residence  halls  are  slowly  losing  the 
battle  for  students’  money  to  the  expanding  Maryville 
housing  market,  which  has  seen  the  addition  of  a  half- 
dozen  new  apartment  complexes  in  the  last  two  years. 

There  are  benefits  to  living  off  campus :  Not  only  do 
students  gain  the  responsibility  of  living  on  their  own, 
but  also  the  amount  of  space  and  privacy  is  greater  by 
comparison.  Also,  fewerrestrictions  apply  to  astudent’s 
conduct  when  living  in  an  off-campus  situation. 

“It’s  understandable  that  during  a  student’s  sopho¬ 
more  year,  after  spending  two  years  in  the  residence 
halls,  the  attitudes  about  communal  living  can  change,” 
said  Wayne  Viner,  Residential  Life  coordinator.  “Off- 
campus  living  can  look  very  attractive.” 

However,  the  benefits  of  on-campus  living  out¬ 
weigh  those  of  living  off  campus. 

The  feeling  of  students  who  live  on  campus  is  that 
residence  hall  living  is,  first  and  foremost,  convenient. 

Students  pay  their  fees  up-front  so  they  do  not  need 
to  be  concerned  with  scraping  together  enough  money 
to  pay  rent  or  buy  food  at  the  end  of  the  month. 

Also,  the  residence  halls  are  within  minimal  walk¬ 
ing  distance  of  all  the  campus  buildings  and  campus 
activities.  Scraping  the  windshield  of  a  car  that  you 
cannot  find  a  parking  place  for  on  campus  is  nb  match 
for  a  short  walk  to  class  from  the  residence  halls. 

On  campus,  cooking  your  own  meals  is  not  even  a 
consideration  with  the  convenience  of  the  Student 


Union,  where  a  variety  of  meals  are  available  and  Second,  provide  recreation  equipment  for  all  resi- 
served  during  flexible  service  hours.  dence  halls.  Perrin  Hall,  for  example,  does  not  have 

Additionally,  the  many  hall  councils  allow  students  Ping-pong  or  pool  tables  for  students  to  enjoy, 
to  involve  themselves  in  leadership  development,  Third,  the  buildings  are  no  more  “residence  halls” 
which  empower  the  students  to  make  change.  now  than  they  were  “dorms”  in  the  past.  Give  students 

However,  if  life  in  the  residence  halls  were  so  the  comfortsofhome:  curtains  on  showers,  carpet  in  all 
picturesque,  then  they  would  be  filled  to  capacity  hallways  and  rooms  and  working  shades  on  windows, 
every  year.  The  fact  is  they  are  not.  Not  only  will  the  addition  of  a  few  modem  conve- 

To  attract  new  students  or  bring  students  back  to  the  niences  dramatically  improve  a  student’s  overall  atti- 


residence  hall  environment,  Residential  Life  should 
make  a  number  of  changes  and  additions. 

First,  offer  housing  contracts  in  one-semester  incre¬ 
ments  in  addition  to  the  year-long  contracts  to  accom¬ 
modate  students  graduating  at  mid-semester.  Break¬ 
ing  an  existing  contract  is  no  easy  task,  so  making  a 
one-semester  contract  available  would  be  ideal. 


tude,  that  attitude  may  become  contagious. 

While  it  is  possible  to  find  inexpensive  off-campus 
housing,  students  are  not  promised  the  convenience 
and  safety  provided  by  Northwest’s  residence  halls. 

The  best  kind  of  living  is  available  on  campus,  but  it 
is  up  to  the  students  to  take  advantage  of  it  and  Res¬ 
idential  Life  to  keep  it  that  way. 


“Because  of  a 
lack  of  freedom. 

They  are  allowed 
to  do  more  things 
off  campus.  They 
can  talk  whenever 
they  want,  they 
can  drink  with 
whomever  they

over  when  they  want.”

“It’s  cheaper. 
•It’s  a  lot  more

think  the  main 
reason  is  it’s  a

Insensitive 
remarks  only 
contribute 
to  growing 
stereotypes 


In  today’s  society,  with  so  many  dif¬ 
ferent  issues  plaguing  us,  we  must 
be  willing  to  help  combat  the  prob¬ 
lems  rather  than  adding  to  them. 

To  make  this  nation  a  truly  great 
place  to  live,  we  must  be  sensitive  to 
these  issues  and  educate  people  so 
these  problems  may  eventually  be  laid 
to  rest. 

With  this  in  mind,  I  cannot  seem  to 
brush  off  an  incident  that  occurred  on 
April  Fool’s  evening  in  Maryville.  I 
believe  this  is  an  example  of  asensitive 
issue  that  should  not  be  joked  about  no 
matter  the  situation  or  severity. 

One  of  my  friends  accidentally 
locked  her  keys  in  her  car  at  around  1 1 
p.m.  Saturday.  After  unsuccessfully 
trying  to  contact  several  local  lock¬ 
smiths,  we  asked  a  nearby  Maryville 
Public  Safety  officer  if  he  could  assist 
us.  Sgt.  Rick  Smail  was  gracious 
enough  to  try  to  unlock  the  car  while 
several  of  us  stood  by  to  observe. 

Smail  was  telling  us  how  difficult  it 
would  be  to  unlock  such  a  new  car 
when  he  said  “If  I  was  a  little  black  boy 
from  Kansas  City  I  could  get  it  open." 

My  seven  friends  and  I  were  ap¬ 
palled  by  the  sergeant’s  insensitive 
comment.  This  was  highly  uncalled 


MY  TURN 


to 


for  and  did  not  get  any  chuckles  from 
any  of  us. 

It  is  people  with  Smart's  stereotypi¬ 
cal  mentality  who  hold  back  this  com¬ 
munity  and  many ,  many  others  in  fight¬ 
ing  for  racial  equality.  How  can  we 
honestly  promote  Maryville  as  a 
friendly  place  that  welcomes  people  of 
all  nationalities  and  races  when  we 
know  the  stereotypes  are  alive  here. 
Many  people  in  this  community  are 
quick  to  judge  because  of  the  stereo¬ 
types  they  grew  up  hearing. 

If  we  wonder  why  Maryville,  and 
the  University  in  particular,  is  not  cul¬ 
turally  diverse,  we  should  look  to  the 
leaders  as  well  as  residents  of  the  Uni¬ 
versity  and  community. 

-  Who  would  feel  welcome  or  even 
want  to  come  to  a  town  where  one  is 
slapped  with  a  stereotype  before  ever 
having  a  chance  to  prove  themselves 
different? 

I  imagine  Sgt.  Smail  regrets  his 
comment,  but  this  perfectly  exempli¬ 
fies  how  one  small  remark  makes  a 
lasting  impression.  Maybe  Smail  did 
not  even  realize  that  what  he  was  say¬ 
ing  would  offend  anyone. 

However,  this  is  where  part  of  the 
problem  lies.  We  all  need  to  think 


sis 


before  we  speak  and  learn  to  be  a  little 
more  sensitive  to  others’  feelings  about 
certain  issues.  This  might  require  a 
reevaluation  of  our  language  and  our 
thoughts  to  remove  those  quirks  that 
deal  with  touchy  subjects. 

I  might  expect  this  comment  to 
come  from  an  uneducated  youth.  How¬ 
ever,  this  particular  man  is  a  profes¬ 
sional  who  is  supposed  to  “keep  the 
peace”  among  the  people  in  this  city 
and  state. 

If  we  wonder  why  students  and 
community  members  have  never  been 
able  to  have  a  good  relationship,  it  is 
because  of  ignorant  and  insensitive 
stereotypes  placed  upon  us.  How  could 
one  feel  trusted  and  respected  knowing 
the  community  has  people  who  will 
not  give  them  a  chance  because  of 
these  stereotypes  they  choose  to  be¬ 
lieve?  If  remarks  and  thoughts  like  this 
are  not  meant  to  offend  or  hurt  anyone, 
I’d  like  to  know  their  purpose. 

It  is  a  shame  that  Smart's  comment 
reflects  upon  his  department  as  well  as 
his  profession.  We  expect  our  officers 
to  act  like  professionals  and  to  be  sen¬ 
sitive  to  issues  plaguing  society  today. 
Sgt.  Smail  did  not  do  either  one  that 
April  Fool’s  night.

Mail  is  my  lifeline  here  at  North¬ 
west.  Without  a  steady  cur¬ 
rent  of  correspondence,  I  sink 
into  a  weird  kind  of  existential  despair, 

,  Maybe  that’s  why  I  found  myself 
staying  up  till  2  a.m.  dialing  1-800 
numbers  from  the  back  of  Rolling  Stone 
magazine,  requesting  free  catalogs  and 
pamphlets  regarding  everything  from 
inventors’  services  to  bladder  control. 

I  caught  myself  using  silly  aliases 
like  “Edward"  and  “Vincent."  When 
the  requested  envelopes  arrived  in  the 
following  days,  I  carefully  cut  away 
the  address  labels  and  taped  them  to  the 
upperleftcomerof  my  envelopes  home. 
My  sense  of  humor  deteriorates  when 
I’m  tired. 

But  I  become  frighteningly  obses¬ 
sive  about  e-mail.  I  log  in  almost  hourly 
to  check  for  messages,  and  my  heart 
sinks  when  thescreen’sannouncement 
“18  New  Mail  Messages"  turns  out  to 
be  an  assortment  of  dirty  jokes  down¬ 
loaded  by  BBS-happy  friends  and  au¬ 


tomatic  responses  from  the  White 
House. 

Did  you  know  you  could  e-mail  the 
White  House?  You  can,  by  addressing 
rants  and  raves  of  various  sorts  to 
“president@whitehouse.gov.” 

Or,  if  you  need  to  voice  an  opinion 
to  Ai  Gore  (who  I’m  beginning  to 
believe  is  nothing  more  than  an 
animatronic  torso  propped  up  in  achair 
behind  Clinton  during  press  confer¬ 
ences),  send  mail  to 
"vice.president@whitehouse.gov." 

I  take  advantage  of  Clinton's  com- 
puteraddress  all  the  time  by  letting  him 
know  what  1  think  about  the  “issues" 
(namely,  UFO  activity,  fraudulent  gov¬ 
ernment  documents  and  orbital  launch 
systems).  Doing  so  sometimes  prompts 
Clinton’s  e-mail-machine  to  crank  out 
“personalized”  letters  on  official  White 
House  stationery: 

"Dear  Mr.  Vincent  Tonnies, 

Thank  you  for  your  views  about  the 
issues  that  currently  affect  our  nation. 


4  Cheers  to  the  music  and  theater  departments 
for  their  hilarious  production  of  “Into  the  Woods." 
Who  would’ve  thought  that  cramming  a  bazillion 
fairy  tales  into  one  story  line  would  be  so  much 
fun,  let  alone  make  perfect  sense.  Too  funny! 

i  Cheers  to  baseball  tans  who  decided  to 
boycott  spring  training  with  replacement  players. 
Attendance  figures  for  this  year’s  spring  training 
dwindle  in  comparison  to  1994.  Message  to 
team  owners:  We’re  not  buying  it. 


f  Jeers  to  Walt  Bodine,  KMBC.  Channel  9’s 
token  old  fogie  restaurant  critic,  lor  staying  on  the 
air  with  his  ridiculous  stories.'  A  fjjw  weeks  ago,  - 
he  was  plugging  a  Kansas  City  salad  bar.  Sure, 
commentary  from  the  elderly  can  add  some 
charm  to  the  news,  but  this  old  fart  has  gotta  go. 
What  do  you  think  of  that  Walt? 

t  Jeers  to  the'GOP  for  being  as  clueless  as  Bill 
Clinton  in  its  first  100  days.  Deficit  reduction  with 
crazy  spending  habits  and  tax  cuts?  Get  real. 


P.S.  For  your  information,  Hillary 
has  NEVER  claimed  to  have  been  ab¬ 
ducted  by  aliens,  and  I  have  no  plans 
whatsoever  to  build  a  UFO  landing 
field  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Washington 
Monument." 

As  you  can  set;,  those  who  say  that 
voters  have  no  real  voice  are  (quite 
wrong.  Thanks  to  my  expert  advice, 
Clinton  stands  a  very  good  chance  of 
losing  the  '96  election ...  that  is,  unless 
he  reprograms  Al  Gore. 

If  you  watch  recent  presidential 
speeches  closely,  you’ll  see  that  Al’s 
nods  are  out  of  .sync  with  Clinton’s 
non-sequiturs. 

This  doesn’t  project  a  particularly 
good  image  to  the  American  people. 
Maybe  I  should  write  to  him  about  it.

Missourian  Staff 


A  member  of  the  Northwest  commu¬ 
nity  will  be  leaving  to  take  a  post  that 
heads  the  Maryville  community  after 
Tuesday’s  election  returns. 

George  English,  a  retiring  govern¬ 
ment  professor  at  Northwest,  received 
the  second-most  votes  in  the  race  for  the 
Maryville  City  Council’s  two  positions, 
edging  out  Tim  Rickabaugh  and  Keith 
Walbum. 

Maryville  Mayor  Dale 
Mathes  received  644  votes 
to  head  the  voting,  followed 
by  English  with  564  tallies.  “We  at

52  votes  —  I  was  flabber¬ 
gasted.  I  was  pleased  that  the  city  of 
Maryville  did  something  to  put  me  that 
far  ahead.” 

Rickabaugh  said  he  did  not  think  the 
election  hurt  his  future  aspirations  and  he 
may  campaign  for  another  position. 

“This  was  more  of  a  boost  than  any¬

Daily  Forum  to  publish  Sunday  edition 


By  TATE  SINCLAIR 

Missourian  Staff 

For  the  first  time  in  its  130-year  history,  the 
Maryville  Daily  Forum  will  publish  a  Sunday 
paper  to  complement  its  weekday  editions. 

Dan  Hester,  Daily  Forum  publisher,  said  the 
publishing  of  a  Sunday  edition  beginning  May  7  is 
a  way  for  the  Forum  to  continue  its  history  as  a  vital 
part  of  the  Maryville  community. 

“We’re ,  the  main  source  for  information  in 
Maryville,”  Hester  said.  “This  edition  will  give  us 
a  chance  to  expand  our  business  and  sports  cover¬ 
age.” 

While  the  newsstand  price  of  the  Sunday  edi¬ 
tion  will  be  75  cents  compared  to  the  daily  price  of 
50  cents,  subscribers  will  see  no  increase  in  their 
bill.  However,  all  Forum  readers  will  have  to  make 


a  sacrifice  in  the  form  of  the  loss  of  the  Monday 
edition,  Hester  said. 

“This  will  enable  us  to  still  print  five  papers  a 
week  and  keep  subscription  prices  the  same,”  he 
said. 

Sports  coverage  will  headline  the  new  section 
B.  The  paper  hopes  to  include  more  professional 
sports  coverage  as  well  as  local  sports  coverage, 
Hester  said. 

A  Sunday  paper  also  gives  local  businesses  a 
chance  to  keep  Maryville  shoppers  in  town  by 
advertising  to  them  on  the  busiest  shopping  day  of 
the  week,  he  said. 

‘This  will  contribute  to  keeping  shoppers  in  the 
community ,”  Hester  said.  “It  gives  retailers  achance 
to  get  shoppers  in  the  door  on  an  important  day.” 

The  Forum  will  also  give  a  guarantee  that  any 
advertising  received  during  the  week  will  receive 


space  in  the  Sunday  paper.  This  form  of  guarantee 
has  not  been  offered  by  the  Forum  before,  and  is  not 
offered  by  any  other  local  paper. 

The  recent  closure  of  the  Maryville  Free  Press 
had  nothing  to  do  with  the  decision  to  begin  pub¬ 
lishing  a  weekend  Forum  edition,  he  said. 

“We  would  have  done  it  one  way  or  another,”  he 
said.  “We’ve  kicked  around  the  idea  of  a  Sunday 
edition  since  I  arrived  here  in  October.  The  timing 
just  seemed  right.” 

Hester  said  he  sees  no  reason  why  the  Sunday 
paper  should  suffer  the  same  fate  as  the  Free  Press 
— a  local  weekly  which  closed  in  March  because  of 
funding  problems  —  because  the  Forum  is  a  daily 
editorial  while  the  Free  Press  was  started  as  a 
weekly  advertiser  with  a  small  news  staff. 

Hester  said  he  thinks  there  will  be  an  increase  in 
subscriptions  because  of  the  new  edition.

with  cntertainmentprovidcdat7  p.m. 
The  program  will  showcase  cultures 
from  all  over  the  world. 

Pat  Foster,  director  of  Multicul¬ 
tural  Affairs,  said  the  event  is  meant 
to  raise  awareness  of  world  cultures. 
The  theme  for  this  year’s  show  is 
“When  the  world  meets  Northwest.” 

“I  think  its  a  great  event  for 
Maryville,”  Foster  said.  “It  exposes 
the  campus  and  community  to  a  lot  of 
international  diversity.” 

Karen  Butler,  president  of  ISO, 
said  much  of  the  talent  will  come 
from  the  organization. 

“We  get  students  who  are  mainly 
from  ISO  to  put  on  a  show  of  dance,” 
Butler  said.  “It’s  mostly  students 
performing  acts  from  their  native 
countries." 

Bayo  Oludaja,  co-sponsor  of  the 
event,  said  other  oreanizations  on 
campus  like  the  Chinese  Student 
Association,  HALO  and  ABC  were 
contacted  to  see  if  they  wanted  to  be 
involved  in  the  presentation.

dinner  and  culture  show  on  Friday.  Native  foods 
prepared  by  the  studentswill  be  served  in  a  buffet. 


Cultural  groups  outside  Mary¬ 
ville  were  also  contacted.  Fostersaid 
the  Haskell  Indian  Nation  from  Kan¬ 
sas  will  be  represented. 

“We’re  looking  forward  to  the 
Haskell  singers  and  dancers  as  well 
as  some  Samoan  dancers  and  a  Turk¬ 
ish  group,”  Foster  said.  “This  is  the 
first  time  a  Native  American  group 
has  performed  for  us.” 

Butler  said  although  many  of  the 
big  acts  will  be  from  out-of-town 


groups,  Northwest  students  will  be 
well-represented. 

“The  local  acts  we  have  include 
some  students  playing  the  piano  and 
Japanese  students  who  are  doing 
native  dance,”  Butler  said.  “We’ve 
seen  one  or  two  and  it’s  looking 
good.” 

International  students  from 
Northwest  will  also  prepare  foods 
from  their  cultures  to  be  served  be¬ 
fore  the  performances. 


“We  have  dishes  from  the  Czech 
Republic,  from  Turkey,  from  Samoa 
and  we’ ve  got  two  different  foods  from 
Africa  to  name  a  few,"  Butler  said. 

The  food  will  be  set  up  like  a  dinner 
buffet,  allowing  people  to  choose  any 
combination  of  ethnic  dishes. 

Tickets  for  the  event  are  $3  for  se¬ 
nior  citizens  and  $5  for  everyone  else. 
They  can  be  purchased  at  the  door  or 
prior  to  the  show  in  the  Administration 
Building  at  the  Student  Services  Desk. 


Song,  dance  enhance  storybook  production

technical  side  of  the  show. 

“All  of  the  show  was  good,  but  I  enjoyed  the 
costumes  and  the  sets,”  Barb  Jones  said. 

The  theater  and  music  departments,  in  associa¬ 
tion  with  Northwest  Encore  Performances,  pre¬ 
sented  the  Tony  award-winning  musical. 

Stephen  Sondheim  wrote  the  animated  music 
and  lyrics,  with  book  by  James  Lapine. 

The  musical  features  a  mix  of  different  fairy 
tales  such  as  Little  Red  Riding  Hood,  Cinderella, 
theBaker’s  Wife,  Rupunzel,  Jackand  the  Beanstalk 
and  hints  of  other  minor  ones.  A  witch  comes  and 


casts  a  spell  on  the  Bakers  so  they  could  not  have 
children  unless  they  obtained  a  cow  as  white  as 
milk  (from  Jack  from  the  Beanstalk),  a  cape  as  red 
as  blood  (which  happened  to  be  from  Little  Red 
Riding  Hood),  a  lock  of  hair  as  yellow  as  com 
(enter  the  Rapunzel  story)  and  a  gold  slipper, 
which,  of  course,  belonged  to  Cinderella. 

These  items,  and  other  meetings  in  the  woods, 
helped  to  grant  everybody’s  wishes,  and  the  first 
act  ended  with  characters  living  “happily  ever 
after.”  Or  did  they? 

The  second  act  forces  characters  back  into  the 
woods  and  shows  what  happens  after  “happily 
ever  after.”  All  the  fairy-tale  characters  blend 


together  in  different  songs  and  dances. 

The  Northwest  production  of  “Into  the  Woods” 
featured  an  added  twist  in  the  form  of  dancing  in 
addition  to  singing.  Jody  Atkinson  from  the  State 
Ballet  of  Missouri  choreographed  thedancing  num¬ 
bers. 

“I  thought  this  musical  went  great  for  the  open¬ 
ing  night,  and  I  was  pleased  with  the  crowd  for  a 
Wednesday  night,”  Atkinson  said. 

Charles  Schultz  explained  why  they  chose  to 
add  dance  to  the  musical. 

“Because  there  is  no  dance  in  the  original  ‘Into 
the  Woods,’  I  decided  the  dance  would  bring  out 
surprises  in  this  music,”  Schultz  said.

SCHOLARSHIP  WINNERS 


By  CHERA  PRIDEAUX 

Missourian  Staff 

A  Northwest  woman  is  one  of  only 
70  students  in  the  nation  to  be  selected 
for  the  $30,000  Truman  Scholarship. 

Jenifer  Harr  was  notified  of  the 
award  by  the  President’s  office  March 
20.  Scholars  are  selected  for  their  lead¬ 
ership  potential,  intellectual  ability  and 
likelihood  of  “making  a  difference.” 

Harr  submitted  a  lengthy  applica¬ 
tion  that  included  aPublic  Policy  analy¬ 
sis.  Her  topic  was  the  government’s 
responsibilities  in  the  area  of  disabili¬ 
ties  such  as  hearing  loss  and  blindness. 

This  topic  has  personal  significance 
for  Harr,  who  has  a  hearing  impair¬ 
ment  called  nerve  deafness,  which  she 
was  diagnosed  with  at  the  age  of  four. 

“I  wanted  to  make  other  people 
aware  of  the  challenges  that  other’s 
face,”  Harr  said.  “I  was  hoping  to  act  as 
an  example  of  what  a  disabled  person 
could  achieve.” 

Harr  was  the  first  Northwest  stu¬ 
dent  to  receive  the  award  which  pro¬ 
vides  $3,000 for  undergraduates  in  their 
senior  year,  and  $27,000  for  graduate 
study.  Harr  was  one  of  only  1 4  finalists 


Funds  grant  student 
education  in  England 


By  CHERA  PRIDEAUX 

Missourian  Staff 

Imagine  receiving  the  chance  to 
study  in  Europe  for  a  year,  earning  a 
master’sdegree  in  half  the  time  it  would 
take  in  the  United  States  and  having  it 
all  paid  for. 

Michelle  Akins  won  a  scholarship 
that  will  give  her  the  opportunity  to 
complete  her  master’s  degree  in  En¬ 
glish  in  England  at  the  University  of 
Birmingham  during  the  1995-1996 
academic  year. 

Akins  interviewed  with  scholarship 
committee  members  for  the  award  af¬ 
ter  the  Rotary  District  nominated  her. 
She  received  official  notice  of  scholar¬ 
ship  from  the  district  in  December. 

The  total  amount  of  the  award  is 
$21,500,  which  covers  all  living  ex¬ 
penses,  airfare,  tuition,  books  and  study 
aides. 

Akins  said  she  believes  it  is  a  privi¬ 
lege  to  have  the  opportunity  to  study 
abroad. 


“Because 
my  emphasis  is 
in  English  lit¬ 
erature,  I’m  de¬ 
lighted  and  hon- 
ored  to  have  this 
^|||Slr  '•  opportunity  to 

^  learn  directly 

Michelle  Akins  will  from  the 

pursue  a  master's  source,”  Akins 

degree  In  England.  saj,j 

Akins  said 

she  will  spend  most  of  her  time  in 
England  studying,  but  she  would  also 
like  to  spend  some  time  learning  more 
about  Europe. 

“I  want  to  go  to  London,  Stratford 
upon  Avon  and  I  would  really  like  to 
go  to  authors’  homes,  Stonehenge  and 
travel  through  as  much  of  Europe  as  I 
can,”  Akins  said. 

Akins  will  graduate  with  a  bach¬ 
elor’s  degree  in  English  in  May.  She 
has  been  the  editorial  assistant'  for 
Green  Tower  Press  and  president  of 
the  English  honorary  SigmaTau  Delta.

Exhibit  features  instructors’  work 


By  SUSAN  LORIMOR 

Missourian  Staff 

Northwest  is  giving  area  art  instruc¬ 
tors  a  chance  to  show  their  stuff.  With 
the  Mid- America  Elementary  and  Sec¬ 
ondary  Art  Teachers  Exhibit,  the  fine 
arts  department  allows  the  public  to 
take  a  peek  at  local  teachers’  artwork. 

The  exhibit,  located  in  the  DeLuce 
Gallery  of  the  Fine  Arts  Building, 
opened  Monday  with  25  pieces  of  art¬ 
work  from  local  artists. 

A  judge  selected  the  pieces  of  art¬ 
work  from  7 1  entries,  Kim  Spradling, 


assistant  professor  of  art,  said.  Jerry 
Miller,  chair  of  the  art  department  at 
Central  Missouri  State  University, 
served  as  judge. 

Of  those  25  selected,  LeDonna 
McIntosh  received  a  Juror’s  Choice 
Award  for  an  oil  canvas  titled  “Gar¬ 
den,  1994.” 

McIntosh  is  a  K- 12  art  teacher  for 
the  Nodaway-Holt  school  district.  Most 
of  her  focus  is  on  oil  painting. 

“Painting  is  hard  work,”  McIntosh 
said.  “This  is  one  way  that  it  pays  off.” 

For  McIntosh,  winning  the  Juror’s 
Award  literally  did  pay  off,  as  she 


received  a  monetary  award.  Jokingly, 
she  admitted  she  would  use  the  money 
to  purchase  more  paint  and  canvases. 

“I  love  to  paint,”  she  said.  “It  is 
what  I  do  in  my  spare  time  and  in  the 
summers.” 

McIntosh  said  she  also  enjoys  par¬ 
ticipating  in  the  exhibits  and  tries  to  do 
so  at  anytime  she  can. 

“It’s  a  great  way  to  get  exposure 
and  feedback  from  other  profes¬ 
sionals,”  she  said. 

This  exposure,  McIntosh  said, 
makes  her  a  more  credible  teacher. 

The  exhibition  is  in  its  fifth  year  at 


Northwest,  with  partial  funding  com¬ 
ing  from  the  Missouri  Arts  Council,  a 
state  agency,  Spradling  said. 

Spradling  listed  two  main  purposes 
of  the  exhibition:  providing  a  nearby 
place  for  teachers  to  showcase  their 
works  and  giving  them  a  chance  to 
compete  with  their  peers. 

Tlie  Mid- America  Elementary  and 
Secondary  Art  Teachers  Exhibit  will 
be  on  display  until  Friday,  April  21, 
Admission  is  free,  Most  exhibits  in  the 
DeLuce  Gallery  run  approximately 
three  weeks  and  are  open  to  the  public 
throughout  the  week  at  various  times.

I  know  the  institution  well,”  VanDyke 
said.  “The  reservations  I  had  wereabout 
my  health  and  the  ability  to  keep  up 
with  a  job  that  is  as  demanding  as  that 
for  the  long  haul.” 

VanDyke  served  in  that  capacity 
for  one  year.  In  the  meantime,  a  com¬ 
mittee  headed  by  Shipley  led  a  search 
to  fill  the  position  permanently.  They 
sifted  through  128  candidates  and  nar¬ 
rowed  them  down  to  six  finalists.  Uni¬ 
versity  President  Dean  Hubbard  then 


narrowed  them  down  to  two. 

In  April  1994,  Richard  Whitman, 
dean  of  the  College  of  Arts  and  Com¬ 
munications  at  James  Madison  Uni¬ 
versity  in  Harrisonburg,  Va.,  visited 
the  University.  He  was  one  of  the  final 
two  candidates  for  the  position  and 
was  hired  shortly  after  his  visit. 

But  Whitman  never  assumed  du¬ 
ties.  He  opted  not  to  come  to  the  Uni¬ 
versity  because  of  “personal  reasons.” 
Much  of  his  decision  is  still  clouded  in 
mystery  as  he  did  not  give  specifics. 

“I  believe  what  he  said  is  what  we 
should  accept:  that  there  were  per¬ 
sonal  reasons,  that  he  felt  it  was  just  not 
a  good  plan  for  him  to  move  to  Mis¬ 
souri,”  VanDyke  said.  “He  was  a  very 


pleasant  man,  veiy  knowledgeable  and 
highly  skilled.  I  think  he  would  have 
been  a  good  match  for  the  campus.” 

Whitman  declined  to  comment  on 
his  role  in  the  VPAA  situation. 

When  Whitman  decided  not  to  as¬ 
sume  the  position,  there  was  talk  of 
going  to  a  matrix  model,  which  would 
have  eliminated  thejob.  However,  Fac¬ 
ulty  Senate  recommended  to  Hubbard 
that  an  interim  be  named  right  away 
and  they  suggested  Shipley. 

Senate  urged  Shipley  to  accept,  but 
she  did  not  give  them  an  answer. 

“I  took  a  little  vacation  and  when  I 
came  back  I  called  and  they  told  me 
they  had  gone  ahead  and  submitted  my 
name,”  Shipley  said.  ‘The  Friday  be- 


fore(classes),PresidentHubbardcalled 
me  and  at  that  point  I  did  feel  some 
obligation  to  give  consideration  to  it.” 

Shipley  accepted  the  position  tem¬ 
porarily.  She  also  asked  that  she  not  be 
called  VPAA  because  she  was  also 
keeping  herjob  as  departmentchair  for 
human  environment^  sciences. 

"I  purposely  asked  to  becalleddean 
of  faculty  and  instruction  to  try  to 
convey  that  I  would  not  be  as  available 
perhaps  as  a  full-time  vice  president 
for  Academic  Affairs  would  be," 
Shipley  said. 

After  more  than  two  years  with  a 
vacant  VPAA  office,  officials  are  hop¬ 
ing  that  the  acceptance  will  now  be  a 
source  of  stability  for  the  University.

Author  calls  work 
‘book  of  memories5 


By  TATE  SINCLAIR 

Missourian  Staff 

Author  Susan  Fromberg  Scheaffer 
captivated  an  audience  of  90  students, 
professors  and  local  residents  Wednes¬ 
day  with  a  reading  from  her  unpub¬ 
lished  book  “The  Golden  Rope." 

Scheaffer  read  three  passages  from 
the  work  which  she  said  is  more  of  a 
“book  of  dreams  and  memories”  than 
anything  else. 

The  book,  which  is  about  the  lives 
of  two  identical  twins  with  differing 
goals,  is  indicative  of  her  work. 

“All  my  books  are  so  different,” 
Scheaffer  said.  “(Except)  they  all  are 
told  in  the  first  person  narrative." 

Scheaffer  said  she  is  able  to  write  in 
this  perspective  because  she  immerses 
herself  in  the  character  and  becomes 
that  person.  She  accomplishes  this 
doing  research  and  talking  to  people 
who  are  similar  to  her  characters  to 
understand  how  they  think. 

Although  she  calls  Brooklyn  and 
Vermont  her  homes,  Scheaffer  said 
she  enjoys  coming  to  the  Midwest  to 
read  her  work. 

This  reading  was  only  her  sixth  or 


seventh  of  the  year,  and  she  plans  to 
revisit  the  heartland  this  summer  when 
she  goes  to  Indiana  for  a  reading. 

While  many  of  Scheaffer’s  read¬ 
ings  occur  in  large  venues  such  as 
Manhattan’s  Public  Theater  or  New 
York’s  92nd  Street  YMCA,  she  said 
readings  in  the  Midwest  are  more  en¬ 
joyable  because  the  audience  is  more 
serious  and  interested  in  the  work. 

“In  places  such  as  New  York,  much 
of  the  crowd  is  made  up  of  other 
writers  who  are  there  just  to  see  what 
you’re  up  to  and  let  people  know 
they’re  still  out  there,”  Scheaffer  said. 

While  her  current  books  have  a 
serious  tone  and  often  deal  with  dark 
subjects,  they  may  still  be  lighter  read¬ 
ing  than  the  works  she  read  when  she 
was  young. 

“I  had  quite  a  macabre  taste  when 
I  was  young,”  Scheaffer  said. 

The  reason  she  learned  to  read  was 
so  she  could  read  a  story  about 
Bluebeard,  mostly  because  of  the  gory 
picture  which  accompanied  it 

Scheaffer,  who  has  written  16  books 
and  more  than  400  poems,  is  currently 
working  as  a  professor  at  Brooklyn 
College  in  New  York. 


Student  Senate 
joins  bar  debate 


STACEY  MEYER/Missourian  Staff 

AUTHOR  SUSAN  FROMBERG  SCHEAFFER  reads  from  her  unpub¬ 
lished  book,  “The  Golden  Rope,”  Wednesday  in  the  University 
Conference  Center.  This  is  her  sixth  or  seventh  reading  of  the  year. 


Members  plan  to  circulate 
petitions  to  allow  minors 
to  gather  in  some  taverns 

By  CHERA  PRIDEAUX 

_ Missourian  Staff _ 

Student  Senate  is  taking  another 
step  in  its  efforts  to  support  the  pres¬ 
ence  of  minors  in  bars  by  providing 
students  an  opportunity  to  sign  a  peti¬ 
tion  supporting  the  “over/under”  nights. 

Senate  members  will  be  in  the  Union 
between  10  a.m.  and  2  p.m.  today  and 
Friday  to  obtain  as  many  signatures  as 
possible  to  present  to  City  Council  on 
Monday. 

Senate  member  Mike  Vinson  sug¬ 
gested  that  students  write  letters  to 
City  Hall  stressing  the  importance  of 
the  “over/under”  nights  at  bars  to  keep 
it  open  as  a  social  gathering  place  for 
students. 

Also  discussed  in  the  Senate  meet¬ 
ing  were  the  changes  in  campus  din¬ 
ing,  including  the  addition  of  Freshens 
Yogurt  next  fall  and  the  possibility  of 


adding  Taco  Lights  in  the  Deli,  along 
with  low-fat  cottage  cheese  and  bottled 
water.  Pizza  by  the  slice  may  also  be 
returning. 

Other  items  on  the  agenda  were 
several  policy  changes  which  require 
all  of  the  off-campus  representatives 
to  live  off-campus  at  the  time  of  the 
first  meeting  and  remain  off-campus 
throughout  their  office  term. 

A  motion  to  require  class  represen¬ 
tatives  to  be  a  member  of  the  class  he 
or  she  is  representing  at  the  time  of 
taking  office  was  also  passed.  Hall 
representatives  also  must  now  be  and 
remain  in  the  residence  hall  they  are 
representing  at  the  time  of  taking  of¬ 
fice. 

Travis  Dimmitt,  Senate  member, 
believes  the  changes  were  necessary. 

‘The  policy  changes  are  very  im¬ 
portant  because  they  are  one  of  the 
things  Student  Senate  had  as  its  main 
goal  for  this  semester,”  Dimmitt  said. 

Senate  is  also  working  on  an  all¬ 
campus  mailing  to  inform  students  of 
the  proposal  restricting  financial  aid. 


Seminar  introduces 


Faculty  Senate  approves  relationship  resolution  better  teaching  ideas 

•  A  k.  AMAI  tw/  X- A  1 * ) 


By  CHRIS  TRIEBSCH 

Chief  Reporter 

Faculty  Senate  passed  a  resolution 
Wednesday  that  will  restrict  teacher- 
student  dating  at  the  University. 

The  resolution  states  that  it  is  un¬ 
ethical  to  date  anyone  who  is  in  charge 
of  giving  grades,  recommendations, 
thesis  advice,  promotions,  salary  in¬ 
creases  and  performance  evaluations. 
In  other  words,  a  professor  could  still 
date  a  particular  student  if  none  of 
those  criteria  were  met. 

According  to  the  wording,  this 
stipulation  would  also  apply  in  pro¬ 
fessor-professor  and  student-student 
relationships. 

Annelle  Weymuth,  executive  as¬ 
sistant  to  the  president,  wrote  the  reso¬ 
lution  and  Faculty  Senate  made  a  few 


minor  changes  in  the  wording  after 
debating  the  issue. 

Also  discussed  at  the  Faculty  Sen¬ 
ate  meeting  was  the  master  plan  that 
will  move  some  departments  to  differ¬ 
ent  buildings. 

Some  of  the  senators, -such  as  Phil 
Lucido,  biology  professor,  said  they 
were  upset  because  they  did  not  be¬ 
lieve  the  administration  was  letting 
them  have  enough  input  in  the  deci¬ 
sions.  They  thought  they  should  have 
more  say  because  of  the  new  philoso¬ 
phy  of  empowering  faculty. 

They  were  most  upset  about  the 
deans  switching  their  offices  to  the 
Administration  Building. 

But  Patricia  Bowers  Schultz,  Fac¬ 
ulty  Senate  president;.' was  quick  to 
point  out  that  only  30  to  50  faculty 
members  attended  a  town  hall  meet¬ 


ing  concerning  this  issue.  She  said  the 
administration  was  listening  to  the  fac¬ 
ulty,  but  people  cannot  always  have 
what  they  want. 

In  other  Senate  news,  Roger  Pugh, 
director  of  admissions,  spoke  to  Sen¬ 
ate  about  the  various  admission  poli¬ 
cies  and  where  Northwest  wants  to 
stand. 

The  University  previously  decided 
to  go  from  an  open  enrollment  institu¬ 
tion  to  a  moderately  selective  institu¬ 
tion.  This  would  automatically  admit 
students  who  receive  an  ACT  score  of 
21  or  the  SAT  equivalent.  Students 
who  receive  lower  would  not  auto¬ 
matically  be  admitted. 

Pugh  said  about  33  percent  of  stu¬ 
dents  are  below  the  index  of  standards, 
but  he  hopes  to  have  that  figure  down 
to  25  percent  next  year  and  eventually 


have  it  down  to  1 0  percent  by  the  year 
2000.  He  said  it  will  take  time  and 
should  therefore  be  done  on  a  more 
gradual  basis. 

Pugh  also  talked  about  where 
Northwest  students  stand  this  year  as 
compared  to  previous  years.  More  stu¬ 
dents  are  taking  more  math,  English, 
social  science  and  natural  science 
classes  in  high  school.  Many  universi¬ 
ties  require  at  least  three  years  of  each. 
The  average  ACT  score  and  grade 
point  average  in  high  school  has  also 
gone  up. 

Pugh  also  said  the  University  could 
probably  start  recruiting  more  students 
,  from  the  21-23  ACT  range  as  the 
-  University ofMissouri-Columbiaand 
Southwest  Missouri  Slate  University 
in  Springfield  increase  theirminimum 
ACT  requirements.

them  learn  how  much  fun  that  (sub¬ 
ject)  can  be,"  Tribus  said.  “So  we  need 
to  find  out  how  to  do  that.  You  have  to 
give  them  that  fun.  Let  them  contribute 
as  a  means  of  hooking  them  on  the 
subject.” 

He  also  told  instructors  that  they 
need  to  show  students  the  purpose  of 
the  subject  they  are  studying. 

He  said  instructors  need  to  help 
students  find  useful  applications  for 
the  subject. 

These  principles  can  work  for  any 
subject,  even  the  ones  you  would  least 
expect,  he  said. 

,  “When, y pit  get., the  students  ex¬ 
tremely,  interested  in.  learning. the  in¬ 
formation,  you  free  up  the  teacher  to  do 
other  things,”  Tribus  said. 

Tribus  also  talked  about  the  differ¬ 


ence  between  grading  and  evaluating 
students.  Grading  students  puts  them 
against  each  other  by  applying  one 
grade  to  their  work,  but  evaluating 
them  specifically  points  out  their 
strengths  and  areas  they  need  to  im¬ 
prove. 

In  addition  to  Tribus,  Welch  talked 
aboutrequirements-based  learning  and 
O’Brien  discussed  assessment  as  learn¬ 
ing. 

Students  also  attended  morning  ses¬ 
sions  in  the  Fine  Arts  Building.  Those 
sessions  focused  on  the  importance  of 
general  education. 

Alumni  from  all  the  colleges  told  of 
their  experiences  and  ho  w  general  edu¬ 
cation  has  helped  them  in  their  careers. 

JessicaElgin,StudentSe'naiepresi- 
dent,  said  more  students  attended  than 
expected  and  the  reactions  she  received 
from  students  were  very  favorable.

Bearcats  open 
MIAA  season 

By  JENI  KLAMM 

Missourian  Staff 

Continuing  its  early  MIAA  season  tradition,  the  softball 
team  split  its  third  straight  conference  doubleheader  Wednes¬ 
day  against  Emporia  State  University  at  Beal  Park. 

Northwest  won  the  first  encounter  with  the  Lady  Hor¬ 
nets  7-3.  The  ’Cats,  on  the  arm  strength  of  junior  pitcher 
Jennifer  Spencer,  held  Emporia  to  four  hits.  For  Spencer,  it 
was  her  ninth  straight  win  in  a  row. 

Junior  shortstop  Natalie  Lesko  paced  the  home  team  at 
the  plate  going  3-3,  scoring  a  run,  plating  two  RBI  and 
swiping  a  base. 

In  the  second  encounter  against  the  Lady  Hornets,  the 
guests  took  advantage  of  three  first  inning  Bearcat  errors  tn 
tie  Northwest,  but  Emporia  plated  two  more  runs  in  the 
second  inning  and  added  solo  runs  in  the  fourth  and  sixth 
innings  to  take  the  victory. 

Freshman  first  baseman  Brenda  Ritland  went  2-3  and 
junior  pitcher  Kristi  Sweeney  watched  her  record  drop  to 
2-6  while  allowing  seven  hits,  three  runs,  three  walks  and 
strike  outs  in  six  innings  of  work. 

Northwest  entertained  Central  Missouri  State  Univer¬ 
sity  on  Saturday,  losing  the  first  game,  6-5,  but  salvaging  a 
win  in  the  ninth  inning  of  the  second  game,  3-2, 

Junior  outfielder  Amber  Cremeens  said  she  believed  the 
Jennies  pulled  ahead  because  the  'Cats  were  not  giving 
what  they  needed  to  give. 

“Weplayed  great  during  both  games  on  Saturday,  but  we 
didn’t  give  enough  to  win,”  she  said.  “During  the  second 
game  we  pulled  together  and  played  really  hard.  We  started 
to  have  everything  fall  into  place.” 

Cremeens  was  3-for-3  at  the  plate  with  two  runs  batted 
in  and  a  double  in  the  first  game, 

Lesko  also  shined  on  offense,  tying  three  school  records 
in  the  game  with  four  hits,  three  runs  scored  and  two 
doubles.  Sophomore  outfielder  Kelly  Randles  pitched  in 
with  a  triple  and  two  runs  scored, 

Senior  pitcher  Kelly  Matthews  said  she  thought  the 
’Cats  improved  with  each  game  against  CMSU. 

‘There  were  no  major  plays  during  the  game,’’  she  said. 
“We  just  kept  getting  better  and  better  with  every  game. 
When  we  have  our  heads  in  the  game,  we  can  play  any  team 
tough.”

Tracksters  triumph  in

Assistant  to  the  Editor 

Coming  off  a  three-week  break  from  compe¬ 
tition,  the  Bearcat  tracksters  showed  no  rust  as 
both  teams  took  first  place  in  the  Northwest 
Track  and  Field  Invitational  Saturday. 

The  men’s  team  won  six  individual  titles, 
while  the  women  took  five. 

Senior  Cody  Buhrmeister  won  the  1 10-meter 
hurdles  with  freshman  Jake  Catherell  right  on  his 
heels,  finishing  in  second  place. 

Rounding  out  the  Bearcat  firsts  on  the  track 
was  senior  Chris  Blondin,  who  won  the  800- 
meter  run. 

In  the  field  events,  freshman  Joe  Reichert  won 
the  discus  outright,  while  sophomore  Mark  Serve’ 
took  home  first  place  in  the  long  jump. 

Senior  Jeff  Fogel  won  the  pole  vault  and 
freshman  Jason  Knobbe  leapt  to  first  place  in  the 
triple  jump. 

Richard  Alsup,  men  ’  s  head  coach,  said  he  was 
surprised  that  the  team  did  as  well  as  they  did. 

“We  did  awfully  well,”  Alsup  said.  “There 
was  no  major  standout,  there  were  a  lot  (of 
people)  that  did  well.” 

Reichert  said  to  contend  in  the  conference  the 
team. 

“We’re  a  young  team,”  Reichert  said.  “(The 
freshmen)  have  to  compete  like  sophomores  and 
juniors  since  most  of  the  teams  (in  the  confer¬ 
ence)  are  older  than  us.” 

On  the  women’s  side,  freshman  Jacshelle 
Sasser  had  an  outstanding  meet,  winning  both  the 
long  jump  and  the  high  jump. 

Junior  Kerry  Doetker  equalled  Sasser’s  jump 
of  5-feet-9-inches,  but  finished  in  second  place 
because  of  the  number  of  missed  heights. 

Sasser’s  jump  was  a  new  invitational  record 
and  both  Sasser  and  Doetker  provisionally  quali¬ 
fied  for  NCAA  Division  n  Nationals  in  Emporia, 
Kan.,  May  25-27. 

Freshman  Kathy  Kearns  won  the  5, 000-meter 
run  and  freshman  Carrie  Sindelar  won  the  800. 

Senior  Nancy  Huppcrt  brought  home  the  final 
individual  championship  for  the  Bearcats,  throw¬ 
ing  herself  into  first  place  finish  in  the  discus. 

Ron  DeShon,  women’s  head  coach,  was  ex¬ 
cited  about  the  way  his  team  performed  after  the 
long  layoff. 

“We  had  a  lot  of  outstanding  performances,” 
he  said.  “It  showed  the  work  of  the  last  three 
weeks  really  paid  off.” 

Sindelar  said  she  sees  a  lot  of  improvement  in 
the  team  since  the  indoor  season. 

“We  have  more  experience,”  Sindelar  said. 
“There’s  more  events  that  the  freshmen  are  used 
to,  except  that  we  won’ t  be  running  like  freshmen 
for  long.” 

Next  up  for  the  team  will  be  the  first  ever 
MIAA  Challenge  this  Saturday  at  the  Herschel 
Neil  Track  with  the  first  event  starting  at  9  a.m. 

The  MIAA  Challenge  will  pit  the  MIAA 
against  the  North  Central  Conference. 

The  MIAA  will  be  outnumbered  nine  schools 
to  five,  as  Emporia  State  University,  Pittsburg 
State  University  and  Missouri  Southern  State 
College  will  not  be  competing,  whereas  every

second  place,  but  his  team  did  not  quite 
play  well  enough  to  achieve  that  goal. 

Despite  the  loss,  Rosewell  said  it 
was  a  good  experience  to  play  against 
some  of  the  tougher  schools  in  the 
region. 

“We  played  in  the  tournament  to 
play  against  good  competition  and  try 
to  improve  our  play  for  the  rest  of  the 
season,"  he  said. 

Afteran  eight-day  break,  the  women 
took  to  the  courts  and  skunked  Baker 
University  7-0  on  Tuesday  at  Baldwin 
City,  Kan. 

Sophomore  Maria  Groumoutis 
raised  her  singles  record  to  1 1-2  on  the 
season  and  junior  Lia  Ruiz  recorded 
her  10th  win  of  the  season. 

Rosewell  said  he  was  impressed 
with  his  team  and  attributed  part  of  the 
success  to  a  few  adjustments. 

"We  played  pretty  good  and  beat  a 
good  NAIA  team  7-0,"  he  said.  “We 
changed  some  things  around  in  the 
doubles  teams  and  it  ended  up  helping 
us." 

Rosewell  said  despite  the  fact  his 
team  had  not  played  in  over  a  week,  he 
expected  his  team  to  be  sharp. 

‘They  have  been  working  out  and 
staying  in  shape  and  have  been  playing 
really  well  in  practice.” 

The  men  and  women  will  be  home 
this  weekend  jo  take  on  the  University 
ofSouthern  Colorado  at  10a.m.Friday 
at  the  Frank  Grube  and  High  Rise 
Courts. 

Both  teams  will  also  be  in  action  on 
Saturday  as  they  play  host  to  Southern 
Illinois  University-Edwardsville. 

“It  is  a  good  weekend  for  men  and 
women,"  Rosewell  said.  "Both  of  those 
teams  have  good  men’s  and  women’s 
teatos  and  I  am  glad  we  are  playing 
them  and  playing  them  here." 


school  from  the  NCC  will  be  there,  with  the 
exception  of  North  Dakota  State  University. 

DeShon  said  the  MIAA  Challenge  will  be  a 
different  kind  of  meet  than  what  people  are  used 
to  seeing.  Instead  of  points  for  finishes  going  to 
that  individual,  points  will  go  toward  the  confer¬ 
ences’  total. 

Buhrmeister  said  he  sees  the  tneet  as  a  chance 
to  check  how  the  team  is  doing  overall. 

“This  will  be  a  good  chance  to  see  where  we 
are,  not  only  in  our  conference,  but  also  in  the 
nation,”  he  said. 

Kearns  said  the  team  is  excited  about  this 
meet. 

“There  is  going  to  be  a  lot  of  great  competi¬ 
tion,”  she  said.  “This  gives  us  a  chance  to  focus 
on  one  event,  instead  of  two  or  three.” 

DeShon  also  expects  to  see  a  lot  of  good 
competition  on  both  sides. 

“I  would  not  be  surprised  to  see  a  lot  of  records 
broken  this  weekend,”  DeShon  said.  “This  should 
be  a  real  treat  for  track  fans."

sophomore  JacqueBurkhart  to  break  the  2-2  tie  and  win  the 
game. 

The  Bearcats  split  games  again  Sunday  in  their  second 
doubleheader  in  as  many  days  against  Northeast  Missouri 
State  Univeristy. 

The  Bearcats  committed  seven  errors  in  the  first  game, 
which  led  to  five  Northeast  runs  and  an  8-3  win  for  the  Lady 
Bulldogs. 

However,  the  Bearcats  did  come  back  in  the  second 
game  to  salvage  the  back  end  of  the  doubleheader,  3-0.  All 
three  Bearcat  runs  were  scored  in  the  second  inning. 

Northwest  will  play  a  doubleheader  at  4  p.m.  Friday 
against  Peru  State  University  at  Beal  Park. 

Tournament  play  begins  at  10  a.m,  Saturday  at  Beal 
Park  against  Dana  College.  At  1  p.m.  the  ’Cats  take  on  St.

Up  to  this  point  in  the  season,  the 
Northwest  men’s  tennis  team  had  been 
slicing  through  its  competition  like  a 
hot  knife  through  butter,  but  its  sharp¬ 
ness  was  tested  by  Graceland  College. 

On  Wednesday,  the  doubles  team 
of  junior  Dave  Subrt  and  senior 
Eduardo  Jarolim  allowed  the  Bearcats 
to  squeak  by  Graceland,  4-3,  in  Lamoni, 
Iowa. 

Subrt  and  Jarolim  defeated 
Alejandro  Anders  and  Barry  Thrutch¬ 
ley  at  No.  2  doubles,  9-8,  to  break  a  3-

Ichabods  prolong  Bearcats’  woes 

By  JEFF  HARLIN 

Missourian  Staff 

After  six  straight  losses,  the  Northwest  baseball  team  has 
watched  its  record  fall  to  .500. 

Included  in  those  six  losses  were  four  to  defending 
NCAA  Division  II  champion  Central  Missouri  State  Uni¬ 
versity. 

Tuesday,  the  Ichabods  of  Washburn  University  came  to 
town  for  an  abbreviated  nine-inning  engagement.  Washburn 
won  convincingly,  22-2,  and  dominated  every  aspect  of  the 
game. 

Northwest  used  eight  pitchers  in  the  game  in  order  to 
“rest-up”  for  future  games. 

Northwest  managed  four  hits  in  the  game.  The  Bearcats 
brought  in  two  runs  in  the  eighth  inning  when  right  fielder 
Justin  Abbott  was  hit  by  a  pitch  and  scored  on  a  double  by 
second  baseman  Derrick  Beasley.  Beasley  then  scored  on  a 
single  by  Jay  Hearn. 

The  ’Cats  opened  a  six-game  homestand  Friday  with  a 
loss  to  the  University  of  Nebraska-Omaha  20-17  Friday. 

The  Mavericks  trailed  by  as  many  as  1 1  runs  before  coming 
back  on  the  ’Cats  and  chalking  up  the  victory. 

The  weekend  series  with  CMSU  started  with  two  highly 
competitive  games  in  whichNorthwestdid  nothaveenough 
firepower  to  keep  up  with  the  Mules.  CMSU  would  claim 
both  games  of  the  doubleheader  Saturday,  7-5  and  7-4. 

In  the  first  game,  Bearcat  junior  centerfielder  Matt 
Fitzmorris  went  3-for-5  with  one  run  batted  in.  Junior  third 
baseman  Mike  Balm  and  senior  shortstop  Brian  Witthar 
both  went  2-for-4,  with  Balm  connecting  on  his  first  homer 
of  the  season. 

Sophomore  Mark  Gutkowski  pitched  three  and  a  third 
innings  of  solid  relief  pitching,  giving  up  one  earned  run. 

In  Saturday’s  second  game,  the  Bearcats  could  only 
muster  four  hits  in  the  7-4  loss.  Of  those  hits,  senior  left 
fielder  Brad  Skriveraccounted  for  two.  Senior  Brent  Goheen 
picked  up  the  complete  game  loss. 

In  Sunday  ’  s  opener,  the  CMSU  bats  came  alive  to  pound 
the  Northwest  pitching  staff  with  26  runs  on  27  hits.  The 
Mules  got  an  outstanding  complete-game  performance 
from  veteran  Bob  Poisal. 

Northwest  had  eight  players  with  one  hit  apiece  in  the 
26-2  schalacking. 

The  final  game  of  the  series  returned  to  baseball-score 
form  as  the  Mules  scored  two  runs  in  the  first  inning  to  grab 
a  lead  they  would  never  relinquish  winning,  6-3. 

Northwest  tried  to  claw  its  way  back  with  three  runs  in 
the  final  four  innings,  but  CMSU  was  able  to  halt  the  attack. 

For  the  second  time  this  season,  Fitzmorris  was  called  to 
the  mound  and  once  again  responded  with  a  complete  game. 

Fitzmorris  gave  up  four  earned  runs  on  lOhitsandstruckout 
'four.  Sophomore  centerfielder  Scott  Soderstrom  led  the 
’Cats  at  the  plate  with  two  hits.

UCLA  fans’  championship  vigor  gets  out  of  hand 

LOS  ANGELES  (AP)  —  Fifteen  people  were  arrested  and 
police  in  riot  gear  fired  rubber  bullets  to  tame  unruly  celebrants  as 
nearly  4,000  people  poured  into  the  streets  of  Westwood,  Calif.,  to 
celebrate  UCLA’s  first  NCAA  basketball  crown  in  20  years. 

Officers  fired  20  bean-bag  and  rubber-bullet  rounds  to  disperse 
revelers  Monday  night  after  the  UCLA  Bruins  beat  the  Arkansas 
Razorbacks,  89-78. 

In  contrast  to  the  Westwood  confrontation,  the  arrival  of  the 
team  at  Los  Angeles  International  Airport  was  an  orderly,  but  still 
jubilant  event. 

Bleary-eyed  from  their  own  night  of  celebration  in  Seattle,  the 
Bruins  were  met  by  400  to  500  fans. 

“Everything’s  basically  a  blur  right  now,"  Ed  O’Bannon  said. 
O’Bannon  grabbed  the  Final  Four  Most  Valuable  Player  by  scoring 
30  points  and  grabbing  17  rebounds  in  the  win  over  Arkansas. 

“We’re  having  agood  time  enjoy  ing  what’s  going  on,”  O’Bannon 
said.  “I’m  happy  we  won  and  that  everybody  appreciates  it.” 

“It’s  a  great  feeling,”  said  UCLA  head  coach  Jim  Harrick,  who 
was  criticized  in  recent  years  for  not  guiding  the  Bruins  to  a  Final 
Four,  much  less  an  NCAA  title. 

“When  your  team  can  step  up  and  play  its  greatest  game  when 
needed,  that’s  the  epitome  of  coaching,”  he  said.  “That’s  what  our 
team  did  last  night.” 

Aftera  brief  celebration  with  the  fans,  the  Bruins  left  by  bus  with 
a  police  escort,  headed  for  the  main  campus  about  10  miles  away. 

But  they  weren’t  going  to  stay  there  long.  The  entire  team  was 
invited  to  be  on  “The  Tonight  Show  with  Jay  Leno,”  which  was 
being  taped  that  evening. 

The  Monday  night  confrontation  between  rowdy  fans  and 
police  in  Westwood  left  one  LAPD  officer  with  broken  ribs.  Some 
bottles  and  rocks  were  tossed  from  the  roving  crowd  of  celebrants 
who  flowed  into  the  Westwood  shopping  and  dining  area  next  to 
the  UCLA  campus. 

“It  was  just  a  few  people  causing  all  the  grief,”  McBride  said. 
“We  had  mostly  law-abiding  individuals  out  there  celebrating  the 
first  championship  in  20  years,  but  some  got  a  little  wild.” 

Within  an  hour  of  the  Bruins’  win  over  Arkansas  in  Seattle, 
police  in  Los  Angeles  went  on  a  city  wide  tactical  alert. 

“With  a  crowd  as  large  as  this,  you’re  going  to  have  someone 
who  is  drunk  who  is  going  to  confront  police  officers,”  officer 
Arthur  Holmes  said. 

At  least  200  officers,  many  in  riot  gear,  marched  into  the  streets 
lined  with  restaurants  and  shops  and  walked  in  lines,  baton  to  baton, 
pushing  the  students  back. 

The  officers  occasionally  charged  the  fans,  jogging  toward 
them  with  their  batons  out  and  discharging  pellets. 

\  Geoff  Christian,  a  UCLA  graduate,  blamed  the  police. 

“We  were  just  celebrating,”  Christian  said.  “Why  did  they  need 
to  save  an  intersection  that  people  were  just  hanging  out  in?” 

Earlier,  the  mood  was  one  of  joy  over  UCLA’s  basketball 
victory. 

“I’m  going  to  cry,”  Gloria  King  said  as  the  Bruins  finished  the 
game  and  patrons  at  Stratton  ’  s  Grill  burst  into  more  than  1 5  minutes 
of  screaming.  '  t-  •  «  ' 

‘This  is  so  unreal,  this  is  just  great,”1  she  said.  “Ern  goirig  ta 
remember  this  forever.”  "V'A‘‘

Storybooks  often  tell  the  story  of  Cin¬ 
derella’s  wicked  stepmother,  Little  Red  Riding 
Hood’s  walk  through  the  forest  and  Jack’s 
attempt  to  sell  his  prized  cow  for  a  mere 
handfiil  of  beans.  But  who  knew  of  all  the 
work  that  must  go  into  bringing  those  stories 
to  life — not  just  in  the  imagination,  but  on  the 
stage. 

“Into  the  Woods”  opened  Wednesday  night 
in  the  Mary  Linn  Performing  Arts  Center.  The 
play  is  a  collaborative  effort  between  the 
theater  and  music  departments.  It  will  run  at 
7:30  p.m.  tonight  through  Saturday  night  with 
a  matinee  at  2  p.m.  Sunday. 

“Into  the  Woods”  is  a  musical  production 
typical  of  a  menagerie  of  common  fairy  tales 
such  as  “Cindrella,”  “Jack  and  the  Beanstalk,” 
“LittleRed  Riding  Hood,"  “The  Baker’s  Wife” 
and  “Rapunzel.” 

To  bring  those  stories  to  life,  it  takes  a 
choreographed  combination  of  producing, 
acting,  directing  and  constructing,  involving 
far  more  people  than  just  the  actors. 

Practice  for  the  Tony  award-winning  mu¬ 
sical  began  in  early  January.  During  this  time, 
the  actors,  musicians,  technicians,  directors, 
costume  designers,  make-up  artists  and 
practicum  classes  were  at  work  for  this  North¬ 
west  production. 

The  following  was  a  “typical"  night  for  the 
cast  and  crew  just  weeks  prior  to  their  perfor¬ 
mance. 

5:35  p.m.  A  box  fan  makes  a  small  rum¬ 
bling  noise  as  it  blows  the  aroma  of  sawdust 
from  the  floor  of  the  Mary  Linn  stage  to  the 
back  of  the  theater.  The  room  remains  empty 
except  for  a  woman  vigorously  practicing  at  a 
piano  in  the  orchestra  pit  in  front  of  the  stage. 

Setting  up  the  woods 

The  stage  for  “Into  the  Woods"  bears  no 
colorful  scenery,  for  the  props  can  still  be  seen 
from  their  beginning  skeletons  —  plywood, 
wire  and  no  paint.  Within  a  few  weeks,  the 
stage  will  provide  the  background  of  several 
different  children's  fables  all  meshed  into  one 
show. 

The  show  will  feature  approximately  175- 
200  dimensional  lights  that  include  seven 
different  theatrical  lights.  Mark  Vams,  scenic 
and  lighting  designer,  along  with  10-12  stu¬ 
dents,  is  in  charge  of  the  lighting.  Vams  also 
organizes  the  design  and  construction  of  the 
set  with  the  help  of  40-50  students. 

Another  important  person  that  helps  to 
make  the  show  run  smoother  is  Director

Crew  members  of  “Into  the  Woods”  watch  After  rehersal,  the  cast  and  crew  met  to 
a  dress  rehersal  and  make  note  of  errors,  discuss  how  the  play  could  be  made  better. 


Charles  Schultz,  associate  professor  of  the¬ 
ater.  Schultz,  along  with  a  committee  of 
theater  faculty  members,  chose  the  play.  A 
committee  of  members  from  both  the  music 
and  theater  departments  then  voted  on  it. 

“We  wanted  something  different  from  the 
old  book  musical  such  as  ‘West  Side  Story,’” 
he  said.  “We  wanted  to  educate  the  students 
with  the  different  genres.” 

5:45  p.m.  The  performers  filter  in  the 
theater  as  they  talk  amongst  each  other  while 
waiting  for  another  long  night  of rehearsal  to 
begin. 

Jerry  Nevins,  the  narrator  for  the  musical, 
said  putti  ng  a  musical  together  requires  more 
work  than  many  realize. 

As  a  theater  major,  various  classes  require 
50  hours  in  theater  shops  such  as  the  scene, 
costume  or  set.  But  other  than  the  required 
work,  Nevins  said  the  experience  is  the  most 
important. 

‘The  best  part  about  it  is  feeling  as  if  you 
are  part  of  an  ensemble,  working  together,” 
he  said.  "It’s  aleaming  experience  and  some¬ 
thing  new  and  different.” 

Jermel  Fryer,  who  plays  Cinderella’s 
prince’s  steward,  said  the  relationship  be¬ 
tween  the  cast  and  crew  is  essential  to  the 
formation  of  the  play. 

“Without  the  performers,  there’s  no  tech¬ 
nicians  and  without  the  technicians,  there’s 
no  performers,”  he  said. 


The  big  bad  wolf  and  his  little  mice 

6  p.  m.  In  the  middle  of  the  theater  seats  sits 
a  wooden  desk.  Behind  the  desk,  assistant 
director  Anne  Einig  watches  as  the  actors 
gather  for  another  night  of  rehearsal. 

Although  Einig  does  not  appear  on  stage 
in  the  show,  her  constant  attention  and  under¬ 
standing  of  each  aspect  needed  for  the  pro¬ 
duction  is  vital. 

Einig’ s  job  requires  her  to  record  the  ac¬ 
tors  blocking  or  where  they  are  to  move 
during  each  scene  of  the  musical,  help  the 
actors  with  their  lines,  schedule  nightly  re¬ 
hearsals  and  act  as  the  director’s  assistant. 

After  a  run-through  of  certain  scenes, 
Einig  goes  through  scene  by  scene  what 
problems  or  positive  comments  Schultz  saw 
during  the  practice. 

While  Einig  works  more  with  the  director 
and  on-stage  talent,  she  said  the  offstage 
work  is  what  makes  the  acting  in  the  spotlight 
come  alive. 

6:05  p.m.  Schultz  begins  practice  with  a 
pep  talk  for  the  crew  and  cast  members. 
Costume  designer  Dyann  Vams  joins  in  and 
infonns  the  members  that  dress  rehearsal 
would  be  later  in  the  week  and  any  problems 
with  costumes  should  be  written  on  the  lists 
posted  on  the  dressing  room  doors,

►WOODS  from  page  9 

Quiet! 

6:23  p.m.  Schultzyells,  "Quiet!"  and  rehearsal  begins. 
Schultz,  with  energy  and  enthusiasm,  stands  approxi¬ 
mately  six  rows  back  and  makes  slight  pauses  while  stand¬ 
ing  by  each  theater  seat  to  view  the  stage  from  a  different 
angle.  Throughout  the  rehearsal,  Schultz  remains  active 
and  content  with  each  aspect  of  the  play. 

‘The  more  enthusiastic  you  are,  the  more  enthusiastic 
they  will  be,”  he  said. 

Although  Schultz  directs  the  rehearsals,  stage  manager 
Bob  Holcombe  takes  over  the  production  after  opening 
night.  Holcombe’s  job  includes  helping  design  the  set  and 
working  as  the  shop  foreman  where  set 
production  takes  place. 

“As  stage  manager,  I  have  to  keep  ev¬ 
erything  straight,”  he  said.  “I  am  in  charge 
Jets  to  °f  both  the  actors  and  the  technicians.”

jger  My,  what  pretty  clothes  you  have! 

TTryp^try  Below  the  Mary  Linn  stage,  past  a  door 
.ill!  a  leading  down  a  flight  of  steps  and  into  a 
maze  of  hallways  and  turns,  is  the  costume 
shop.  The  stop  is  filled  with  many  authentic  costumes. 

Here  Dyann  Vams,  costume  and  makeup  designer, 
brings  many  of  the  characters  to  life  with  a  little  material 
and  a  lot  of  imagination. 

Vams’  ideas  for  the  costumes  come  from  a  combination 
of  the  script,  the  time  period  and  the  types  of  characters  in 

the. play....,.,  .  ■.  ,  ,m  Y»«*  v'''1'1’ 

“Usually  I  make  my  own  patterns  pr^qombination  of 
patterns  from  stores,  but  those  are  not  durable!”  Vams  said. 

The  majority  of  the  costumes  for  “Into  the  Woods”  have 
been  made  from  scratch,  while  some  costumes  are  used  out 
of  “wardrobe  storage,”  which  consists  of  costumes  saved 
from  prior  theater  productions. 

In  addition  to  costumes,  Vams  is  also  in  charge  of  the 
actors’  make-up.  Four  dressers  and  two  wig  people  will 
assist  with  the  actors’  backstage  preparations.  While  the 
cast  members  usually  apply  their  own  makeup,  two  char¬ 
acters  require  a  mask. 

Little  Red  Riding  Hood  and  the  wolf  require  a  foam 
latex  mask,  much  like  those  from  “Beauty  and  the  Beast,” 
Vams  said. 

While  the  masks  for  the  play  are  not  as  detailed  as  in  the 
Broadway  musical,  each  mask  took  about  three  days  to 
make. 

Because  each  character  requires  preparation,  Vams  has 
to  pace  her  work  weeks  before  practice. 

“One  of  the  hardest  things  is  the  time  element,”  she  said. 
“With  teaching  all  day  and  with  classes,  actors  also  don’t 
have  time.” 

Despite  the  extra  time  spent  working  behind  the  scenes, 
Vams  said  that  everyone  working  on  and  offstage  must 
keep  a  positive  attitude  throughout  the  entire  process. 

“It’s  really  fun  to  watch  someone  do  or  accomplish 
something,”  she  said.  “It  all  depends  on  self-preservation. 
If  you  are  miserable,  then  so  is  everyone  around  you.  You 
have  to  have  realistic  expectations  if  you  know  something 
is  going  to  be  difficult  and  timely.” 

6:35  p.m.  Vams  continues  to  work  downstairs  as  the 
sound  of  actors  singing  drifts  down  from  the  stage  above 
where  they  are  hard  at  work. 

6:45  p.m.  Back  upstairs,  Schultz  continues  to  intently 


'  watch  the  actors  and  quietly  speaks  to  Einig  about  them 
Near  the  front  of  the  theater,  actors  involved  in  later  acts 
in  the  play  remain  in  their  seats  where  most  of  them  review 
their  lines,  waiting  for  their  time  to  hit  the  stage. 

For  some,  no  amount  of  time  or  preparation  can  squelch 
the  anxiety  and  anticipation  that  comes  with  their  parts. 

Jennifer  Combs,  who  plays  Little  Red  Riding  Hood’s 
Granny,  constantly  thinks  about  memorizing  her  lines  and 
her  part. 

“I  think  about  it  a  lot,”  she  said.  “I’ll  be  sitting  in  class 
going  over  the  songs  in  my  head.” 

Although  audiences  will  see  only  the  performance, 
Combs  said  that  a  play  cannot  continue  without  those 
people  behind  the  scenes. 

“It  is  not  just  inside  this  room,”  she  said.  “The  progress 
they  (set' designers)  have  made  is  incredible  in  a  short 
amdunt  of  time.” 

The  woods  are  alive  with  the  sound  of  music 

6:55  p.m.  The  majority  of  the  actors  are  now  on  stage 
singing  a  chorus  number,  "Into  the  Woods,  ”  and  dancing 
in  sync  at  the  same  time. 

The  music  and  lyrics,  written  by  Stephen  Sondheim 
and  the  script  by  James  Lapine,  do  not  usually  have  any 
dancing  numbers  incorporated  in  the  performance.  How¬ 
ever,  the  current  theater  production  has  been  altered  to 
include  such  numbers  and  new  characters  added  to  main¬ 
tain  its  individuality. 

“We  have  incorporated  a  great  deal  of  dance  between 
the  wolf  and  Little  Red  Riding  Hood,  the  bumping  of  the 
three  men  from  Cinderella,”  Schultz  said.  “We  added 
characters  such  as  Little  Bo  Peep.  None  of  these  are  in  the 
original  show.” 

Although  the  show  will  feature  those  additions  and 
changes,  Schultz  said  he  believes  it  is  important  to  maintain 
the  play’s  originality. 

“We  wanted  to  make  it  unique  but  not  destroy  it,”  he' 
said. 

Choreographer  Jody  Atkinson,  who  has  also  been  an 
assistant  choreographer  and  performed  in  various  musicals 
at  Kansas  City’s  Starlight  Theater,  was  hired  to  incorporate 
dancing  where  she  thought  it  was  necessary. 

7:05  p.m.  The  first  three  acts  must  start  over  for  some 
extra  practice. 

7:30  p.m.  The  play  continues  with  a  scene  featuring 
Cara  Gitto  as  Little  Red  Riding  Hood  and  Shad  Ramsey  as 
the  sly  Wolf. 

In  addition  to  learning  new  dance  moves,  Ramsey  has

had  to  adapt  to  dancing  and  singing  in  his  wolf 
costume.  The  costume  is  padded,  which  makes  it  hot 
to  work  in.  • 

“It  wasn’t  that  difficult  really,”  he  said.  “Espe¬ 
cially  when  you  had  a  professional  choreographer, 
one  who  is  patient  and  creative.” 

Fee  Fi  Foo  Fum! 

As  the  actors  strut  their  stuff  onstage,  another 
aspect  of  this  complex  performance  takes  place 
behind  a  window  in  the  back  —  the  sound. 

Brian  Noerrlinger,  sound  designer  and  audio  en¬ 
gineer  for  “Into  the  Woods,”  is  in  charge  of  creating 
the  various  sound  effects  needed  for  “making  the 
fairy  tales  come  alive.”  Approximately  180  sound 
cues  such  as  birds  singing,  giant  noises  and  the  sound 
of  a  beanstalk  rising  are  necessary. 

Noerrlinger  found  many  of  those  sounds  in  a 
sound  effects  library.  While  sounds  such  as  a  bird 
chirping  were  easy  to  find,  others  had  to  be  built  from 
scratch.  In  one  scene,  when  the  giant  from  “Jack  and 
the  Beanstalk"  throws  the  narrator  across  the  stage, 
a  new  sound  had  to  be  created.  In  order  to  make  the 
sound  of  the  narrator  hitting  the  ground,  Noerrlinger 
dropped  a  sand  bag  and  recorded  the  noise. 

With  20  microphones  in  place,  Noerrlinger  will 
also  wear  a  headset  to  communicate  with  Holcombe 
during  the  play.  That  way,  the  headset  is  used  so 
Holcombe  can  give  Noerrlinger  sound  cues. 

Rapunzel,  Rapunzel,  Let  Down  Your  Hair! 

Another  behind-the-scenes  job  required  for  the 
fairy-tale  production  is  props.  Propmaster  Jeff 
Johnston  is  in  charge  of  constructing  the  props  for  the 
play  and  making  sure  they  are  in  the  correct  place. 

One  of  Johnston’s  most  difficult  props  to  make 
was  Rapunzel’s  braid  —  a  strand  25  feet  long  and  a 
foot  wide.  On  the  weirder  side,  he  also  had  to 
construct  a  chicken  that  was  able  to  move  across 
stage  by  itself. 

7:50  p.m.  Holcombe  comes  out  of  the  corridor  to 
catch  Johnston,  who  is  standing  outside  of  the  the¬ 
ater  for  last-minute  instructions.  Holcombe  informs 
Johnston  of  a  problem  with  a  prop  and  says  he  does 
not  want  to  worry  about  it  during  the  show.  Johnston 
quickly  assures  Holcombe  everything  would  be  in 
place  and  working  for  the  show.  After  their  brief 
conversation,  both  return  to  wort 
,  8:10  p.m.  More  than  an  hour  passes  and  the 
actors  are  still  hard  at, wort  Tired  as  they  seem,  they 
continue  practicing. 

8:40 p.m.  Schultz  tells  the  cast  and  crew  to  “ take 
10.  ”  Lisa  Lawrence,  pianist  and  Northwest  alumna, 
moves from  her  place  in  the  orchestra  pit  to  chat  with 
the  actors. 

Lawrence’s  piano  sits  just  below  the  stage  during 
practice,  but  she  must  memorize  and  listen  closely 
because  during  the  actual  performance,  the  pit  will  be 
lowered  and  she  will  not  be  able  to  see  the  actors  on 
stage. 

Lawrence  also  played  for  “West  Side  Story.”  She 
said  her  love  for  music  has  encouraged  her  to  con¬ 
tinue  her  career  and  to  someday  play  professionally. 

Lawrence  must  also  practice  with  Vocal  Director 
Patricia  Bowers  Schultz,  associate  professor  of  mu¬ 
sic,  in  addition  to  the  actors.  , 

"Sometimes  I  feel  sluggish,  but  just  knowing  I’m 
a  part  of  it  is  a  great  feeling,”  Lawrence  said. 

Getting  Ready  for  the  Night  of  the  Ball 

Charles  Schultz  agrees  dedication  and  hard  work 


are  essential  to  working  on  the  musical. 

“It  requires  a  great  deal  of  work  and  dedication,” 
he  said.  “But  the  dedication  is  automatic.  There  are 
talented  people  behind  it  and  professionals  in  charge.” 

Jill  Newland,  who  portrays  Cinderella,  said  the 
immediate  benefits  actors  receive  from  the  show  are 
overwhelming. 

"Performing  for  everyone  is  kind  of  a  rush,”  she 
said. 

To  stay  in  shape  physically  and  mentally  for 
practice,  Newland  said  she  takes  vitamins  and  often 
avoids  drinking  a  lot  of  Coke.  Newland  has  a  main 
singing  part  in  the  play,  so  she  must  rest  her  voice  and 
avoid  straining  her  voice  when  talking. 

“I  try  to  get  extra  sleep  on  weekends  —  it  cuts 
back  on  my  social  life,”  she  said. 

Despite  that  lack  of  social  life,  Schultz  said  the 
main  motivation  comes  mostly  from  the  students, 
not  from  his  directing. 

“They’re  their  biggest  pushers,”  he  said.  “It’s  not 
a  matter  of  peer  pressure;  we  want  to  do  the  best  we 
can.” 

Patricia  Bowers  Schultz  works  closely  with  all 
the  singers  on  the  vocals.  Most  of  the  performers  are 
music  majors. 

“I  did  a  lot  of  work  with  the  students,”  Schultz 
said.  “We  got  together  in  the  voice  studio  with  the 
accompanist  right  after  Christmas.  Before  I  could  do 
anything,  I  had  listen  to  make  sure  that  they  could 
come  in  at  the  right  time  and  that  their  dictation  was 
clear.” 

Schultz  found  the  most  difficult  part  of  the  music 
was  the  constant  movement  involved.  Some  actors 
must  sing  while  moving  around  the  stage,  which  she 
said  takes  time  and  practice  because  of  the  combina¬ 
tion  of  the  two  physical  activities. 

“If  you  don’t  understand  the  singing,  then  you 
lose  the  plot,”  she  said. 

Richard  Weymuth  and  Ernest  Woodruff,  both 
associate  professors  of  music,  are  the  other  musical 
directors  in  the  play. 

Woodruff  will  direct  the  pit  orchestra,  which 
includes  eight  students,  seven  hired  St.  Joseph  Sym¬ 
phony  members  and  one  pianist. 

The  orchestra  members  practiced  the  music  by 
themselves  before  practicing  with  the  actors.  Ap¬ 
proximately  two  weeks  before  the  performance,  the 
orchestra  joined  the  remainder  .of  the  cast  and  crew 
for  final  rehearsals. 

8:50  p.m.  Schultz  informs  the  actors  that  he  wants 
to  go  through  the  first  act’s  scenes  one  more  time 
'without  stopping. 

9:42  p.m.  Sitting  on  stage,  the  cast  and  some  crew 
members  gather  together  to  hear  how  their  perfor¬ 
mance  went  for  the  night.  As  Charles  Schultz,  Einig 
and  Patricia  Bowers  Schultz  speak,  the  lights  from 
the  stage  dim  behind  the  actors,  giving  a  hint  that  the 
nightly  practice  is  wrapping  up.  Technicians  and 
Crew  hands  quietly  join  in  the  discussion  a  few 
minutes  later.  Soon  afterward,  the  whole  crew  is 
present. 

10:05  p.m.  Holcombe  thanks  the  cast  and  crew 
for  their  hard  work  and  dedication.  Another  night 
has  passed  in  preparation  for  the  musical  "Into  the 
Woods." 

“They  all  realize  it’s  not  just  one  individual,” 
Charles  Schultz  said.  “It’s  a  matter  of  letting  them 
become  a  big  team,  a  comradeship.” 

10:10p.m.  The  lights  dim  and  the  theater  begins 
to  clear. 

After  six  nights  of  practice  a  week  for  three 
months,  the  storybooks  have  closed  and  the  cast  and 
crew  are  ready  to  go  “into  the  woods.”

‘Circle  of  Friends’ 

★★  (out  of  four) 

Stare:  Minnie  Driver,  Chris  O'Donnell, 
Colin  Firth 

Director:  Pat  O'Conner 

Reviewer:  Mike  Johnson _ ^ 

Thecharming  Minnie  Driver  drives 
the  film  adaptation  of  Maeve  Binch- 
ley’s  bestsellpr,  “Circle  of  Friends,” 
for  most  of  its  90  minute  length. 

Unfortunately,  because  of  a  script 
that  stalls  with  some  nasty  subplots, 
she  is  unable  to  drive  it  into  the  win¬ 
ning  circle. 

Driver  plays  Benny,  an  overweight 
young  Irish  woman  who  forms  a  seem¬ 
ingly  unbreakable  circle  of  friends  with 
.childhood  chums,  the  sweet  Eve  and 
slutty  Nan. 

While  attending  college,  Benny  falls 
in  love  with  a  handsome  pre-med  stu¬ 
dent  named  Jack,  played  by  the  blandly 
good-looking  Chris  O’Donnell. 

Jack  in  vites  Benny  to  the  big  dance, 
but  she  is  forced  to  sit  teary-eyed  in  the 
comer  while  he  dances  with  the  other 
women  in  the  dance  hall. 

As  she  starts  to  leave,  Jack  finally 
asks  her  to  dance. 

Benny  says  in  amoment  of  startling 
honesty,  “Well,  you  certainly  tookyour 
time  getting  to  it.  Although  I  may  look 
like  a  hippo,  I’m  really  quite  thin- 
skinned.” 

The  scenes  with  Benny  and  Jack, 
two  young  virgins  in  love,  have  such  a 
sweet,  sexy  charm,  making  the  dis¬ 
heartening  turn  of  events  that  fojlows 
even  more  depressing. 


DELIGHTFUL  NEWCOMER  MINNIE  Driver  freshens  up 
at  the  big  dance  with  her  friend  Nan,  played  by  Saffron 


Bellows,  in  the  coming-of-age  love  story  based  on 
Maeve  Binchley’s  bestselling  novel,  “Circleof  Friends.” 


Those  expecting  a  nice,  sweet  ro¬ 
mance  will  be  sorely  disappointed. 
Although  set  in  the  ’50s,  this  is  a  ’90s 
mo''ic,  replete  with  modem  sensibili¬ 
ties  and  behavior. 

By  the  time  the  credits  roll,  the 
movie’s  house  of  cards,  including  a 
near  rape,  death  and  adultery,  has  col¬ 
lapsed.  Only  one  card  remains  stand¬ 
ing:  queen  of  broken  hearts,  Driver. 

After  Benny  has  learned  Jack  has 
cheated  on  her,  she  blames  herself. 


Driver  is  heart-breaking  as  she  tries  to 
come  up  with  excuses  for  why  Jack  did 
it. 

Throughout  all  the  dark  subplots 
written  nondescriptly  by  Andrew 
Davies,  Driver  keeps  the  movie  afloat 
with  a  seemingly  effortless  charm. 

In  strange  career  twists,  Driver’s 
next  role  will  be  as  a  Bond  girl,  as  in 
James  Bond,  and  O’Donnell  will  play 
Robin  to  Val  Kilmer’s  Batman  in 
“Batman  Forever.” 


While  O’Donnell  lacks  the  edge  to 
give  audiences  a  multi-dimensional 
Robin,  Driver  promises  to  make 
chopped  wood  of  the  latest  Bond,  the 
deadly  dull  Pierce  Brosnan. 

Whether  or  not  she  can  pull  off  that 
coup  remains  to  be  seen.  However,  in 
“Circle  of  Friends,”  Driver  is  a  purring 
Model-T,  with  O’Donnell  as  an  attrac¬ 
tive  hood  ornament. 

It’s  just  too  bad  the  movie  is  a 
creaky  Yugo. 


THE  STROLLER

clocks  set

Man  fights  losing  battle  against  time

Your  Man  has  noticed  something  very 
troublesome,  at  least  to  me. 

It  seems  that  every  building  on  this 
campus  operates  on  its  own  time.  It’s  like  we 
have  lots  of  different  time  zones  right  here  at 
Northwest. 

It  really  has  no  effect  on  those  people  who 
have  all  of  their  classes  in  one  building,  but 
heaven  forbid  if  you  have  to  change  buildings. 

Your  Man  is  one  of  those  unfortunate  fools 
who  has  classes  back  to  back  in  different 
buildings. 

Trying  to  make  it  from  one  class  to  the  next 
with  enough  time  is  next  to  impossible.  Your 
Man  isn’t  a  great  athlete  and  running  from  one 
class  to  another  is  not  his  idea  of.  fun. 

Because  of  course,  I  go  from  one  building 
that  runs  ten  minutes  slow  to  a  building  that 
runs  five  minutes  fast. 


Coiden  Hall  has  taken  on  the  time  zone  of 
the  West  Coast  —  at  least  ten  minutes  slower 
than  any  other  building  on  campus. 

Garrett-Strong  is  the  East  Coast  and  is 
always  running  ahead. 

Luckily,  Your  Man’s  early  classes  are  in 
Coiden,  I  need  every  extra  minute  I  can  get  in 
the  mornings. 

Wells  Hall  is  the  most  confusing  of  all, 
though.  It  has  different  times  between  the  top 
and  bottom  floors. 

I  need  to  wear  four  watches  just  to  know 
when  I  need  to  be  somewhere  by  their  stan¬ 
dards  of  time. 

All  my  teachers,  I  hope,  are  becoming 
accustomed  to  my  tardiness  in  their  classes. 
At  least  they  should  be — I’veonly  made  it  to- 
a  couple  of  classes  on  time  this  semester. 

For  a  while,  I  thought  I  had  it  all  figured 


out.  I  actually  made  it  to  a  few  of  thetp  on 
time,  I  was  so  proud.  My  teachers  actually 
smiled  at  me  when  they  saw  me  silting  when 
class  began. 

But  no,  daylight  savings  had  to  go  into 
effect.  Not  only  did  I  lose  an  hour  of  sleep  that 
I  can’t  reclaim  until  next  fall,  but  also  every¬ 
one  moved  their  clocks. 

Now  I  have  to  go  through  all  the  trouble  of 
figuring  out  what  time  my  classes  are  going 
on  again. 

With  only  a  few  weeks  left  in  the  semester, 
Your  Man  is  beginning  to  lose  hope. 

My  record  is  so  bad  now,  why  bother. 
Besides,  my  instructors  might  go  into  cardiac 
arrest  if  I  showed  up  on  time  two  classes  in  a 
row. 

The  Stroller  lias  been  a  tradition  at  North¬ 
west  since  1918.
