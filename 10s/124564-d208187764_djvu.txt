STATE  OF  TEXAS 
COUNTY  OF  TARRANT 


KNOW  ALL  MEN  BY  THESE  PRESENTS: 


Lessor:  Paul  William  Meissner,  and  spouse  Laurie  Meissner 
6327  Cobblestone  Ln. 
Arlington,  TX  76001 

Lessee:  Cheaha  Land  Services,  LLC 
PO  Box  122119 
Fort  Worth,  TX  76121 

Effective  Date:  October  17,  2007 

Lessee,  named  above,  is  the  present  owner  of  an  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease  (the  "Lease"),  dated  October 
17, 2007,  from  Paul  William  Meissner,  and  spouse  Laurie  Meissner,  and  recorded  in  Instrument  #D208008982  of 
the  Official  Records  of  the  Tarrant  County,  Texas. 

At  the  time  the  Lease  was  entered  into,  the  description  of  the  lands  contained  in  the  Lease  was  believed  by 
Lessor  and  Lessee  to  cover,  and  was  intended  by  them  to  cover,  certain  lands  owned  by  Lessor. 

Since  the  execution,  delivery,  and  recording  of  the  Lease,  it  has  been  discovered  that  the  description  of 
lands  contained  in  the  Lease  does  not  adequately  describe  the  lands  Lessor  intended  to  lease  to  Lessee.  Lessor  and 
Lessee  desire  to  amend  and  correct  the  description  of  lands  contained  in  the  Lease  to  accurately  identify  the  lands  to 
be  covered  by  the  Lease. 

For  adequate  consideration,  and  the  further  consideration  of  the  obligations  and  agreements  contained  in 
the  Lease,  Lessor  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the  Lease  shall  cover,  and  the  Lease  is  amended,  so  that  it  now 
covers  the  following  lands  in  the  county  and  state  named  above: 

Lot  10,  Block  15,  Fannin  Farm,  Phase  IV,  an  Addition  to  the  City  of  Arlington,  Tarrant  County,  Texas.  According 
to  Plat  recorded  in  Cabinet  A,  Slide  2716,  Deed  Records,  Tarrant  County,  Texas. 

Lessor  ratifies,  adopts,  and  confirms  the  Lease  and  extends  the  Lease  to  cover  the  lands  described  in  this 
Amendment  as  if  the  description  of  lands  set  out  above  had  been  originally  included  in  the  Lease.  Lessor  grants, 
leases,  and  lets  to  Lessee,  its  successors  and  assigns,  the  lands  described  in  this  Amendment  for  the  purposes  and 
upon  the  terms,  conditions,  and  provisions  contained  in  the  Lease. 

This  Amendment  shall  be  binding  for  all  purposes  on  Lessor  and  Lessor's  successors,  heirs  and  assigns. 

we  Amendment  is  signed  by  Lessor  and  Lessee  as  of  the  date  of  the  acknowledgment  of  their  signatures 
below,  bu/isjeffective  for  all  purposes  as  of  the  Effective  Date  stated-above.
