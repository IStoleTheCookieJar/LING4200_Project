IN  MEMORIAM 


Jean  R.  Yawkey 

♦ 


epay  tribute  to  the  memory  of  Mrs.  Jean  R. 
Yawkey,  chairwoman  of  the  Board  of  the  JRY 
Corporation,  a  general  partner  of  the  Boston 
Red  Sox,  who  passed  away  at  the  age  of  83  'Wednes¬ 
day,  February  26, 1992,  as  a  result  of  complications 

from  a  stroke. 

The  long  tradition  of  Yawkey  ownership  first  began  when 
Tom  Yawkey  purchased  the  club  in  1933.  Mrs.  Yawkey  married 
Tom  in  1944  and  attended  virtually  every  home  game  in  Fenway 
Park  since  then.  She  was  always  involved  in  the  operations  of  the 
club,  but  she  made  even  more  of  an  impact  on  the  community 
through  the  millions  of  dollars  she  gave  to  various  charities. 

Mrs.  Yawkey  always  avoided  personal  publicity  as  she  went 
about  helping  others  in  a  quiet  way.  She  served  as  chairwoman  of  the 
board  of  the  Jimmy  Fund,  and  participated  in  the  1990  dedication  of 
the  Thomas  A.  Yawkey  Research  Laboratories  at  the  Dana-Farber 
Cancer  Institute.  The  Jimmy  Fund,  which  is  the  primary  fund¬ 
raising  arm  of  Dana-Farber,  has  been  the  official  Red  Sox  clmrity 
since  1952. 

An  avid  enthusiast  of  wildlife,  Mrs.  Yawkey  maintained 
great  interest  in  the  care  and  maintenance  of  The  Tom  Yawkey 
Wildlife  Center  in  Georgetown,  SC.  This  40,000-acre  preserve  was 
the  former  winter  home  of  the  Yawkey' s  and  was  donated  to  the  state 
of  South  Carolina  by  Mr.  Yawkey  in  1976.  The  preserve  is  managed 
by  the  South  Carolina  Wildlife  and  Marine  Resources  Department, 
with  funding  from  The  Yawkey  Foundation.  Mrs.  Yawkey' s 
extensive  knowledge  of  the  environment  and  waterfowl  permitted 
her  to  take  a  leading  role  in  the  oversight  of  the  wildlife  center.  Mrs. 
Yawkey  also  was  a  strong  backer  of  the  Nature  Conservancy. 

The  Yawkeys  co-founded  the  Tara  Hall  Home  For  Boys, 
located  in  Georgetown,  SC,  in  1972.  In  addition  to  major  financial 
support  of  the  home  and  school,  Mrs.  Yawkey  would  always 
remember  each  boy  at  Christmas.  Last  fall,  she  sent  the  entire 
school  to  an  Atlanta  Braves'  playoff  game. 

Since  moving  to  Boston  on  a  full-time  basis  in  the  1980s, 
Mrs.  Yawkey  became  involved  in  numerous  charitable  endeavors. 
She  helped  to  establish  the  Family  Inn  in  Brookline,  a  temporary 
home  for  families  undergoing  transplant  surgery  in  Boston  area 
hospitals.  She  was  also  a  major  donor  to  organizations  such  as  the 
Pine  Street  Inn,  Rosie's  Place,  the  Boys  and  Girls  Club  of  Boston, 
the  Daniel  Man  Boys  and  Girls  Club  in  Dorchester,  The  Boston 
Food  Bank's  Second  Helping  Program,  The  Sports  Museum, 


Massachusetts  General  Hospital,  and  the  Boston  Pops  Orchestra, 
whose  music  she  particularly  appreciated. 

Mrs.  Yawkey  also  established  a  number  of  scholarships  over 
the  years  to  provide  educational  opportunities  to  those  who  othenvise 
could  not  afford  to  further  their  education. 

Most  of  all,  Mrs.  Yawkey  loved  the  game  of  baseball.  She 
was  a  true  friend  to  many  of  the  players  and  the  employees  of  the 
club.  It  did  not  matter  if  one  swept  up  the  park,  ran  the  scoreboard, 
or  made  major  business  decisions.  She  always  had  a  smile  and  a 
kind  word  for  them.  The  employees  of  the  Red  Sox  were  family  to 
Mrs.  Yawkey. 

Besides  the  Red  Sox,  Mrs.  Yawkey  was  a  big  supporter 
of  amateur  baseball.  She  funded  the  1984  United  States  Olympic 
Baseball  team's  visit  to  Fenway  Park  for  an  exhibition  game  against 
the  Boston  Park  League.  The  Yawkey  Baseball  League  and  the 
Park  League  are  supported  on  an  ongoing  basis  by  the  Yawkey 
Foundation.  The  Rookie  League,  a  program  to  involve  inner-city 
youngsters  at  a  very  early  age  with  the  game  of  baseball,  was  a  pet 
project  of  Mrs.  Yawkey.  In  addition,  the  College  Beanpot  Baseball 
Tournament  was  born  in  1990  with  the  help  of  Mrs.  Yawkey’ s 
support. 

Mrs.  Yawkey  was  also  a  director  of  the  National  Baseball 
Hall  of  Fame  and  Museum  in  Cooperstown,  NY,  holding  the 
distinction  of  being  the  first  woman  ever  elected  to  serve  on  its  board. 
In  addition  to  her  involvement  as  a  director,  Mrs.  Yawkey  provided 
leadership  funding  for  the  Hall  of  Fame's  recent  addition,  the  Fetzer- 
Yawkey  Building.  And,  at  the  time  of  her  death,  she,  through  the 
Yawkey  Foundation,  had  committed  to  a  major  expansion  project 
of  the  National  Baseball  Hall  of  Fame  Library. 

In  recent  years,  Mrs.  Yawkey  received  several  awards 
including  the  Greater  Boston  Chamber  of  Commerce  1991 
Distinguished  Bostonian  Award.  In  1988,  the  New  England  Council 
of  Women  Professionals  presented  Mrs.  Yawkey  with  the  First 
Annual  Jean  R.  Yawkey  Award.  Each  year  it  is  awarded  to  a  woman 
who  embodies  outstanding  leadership  qualities  and  who  significantly 
contributes  to  New  England's  community  spirit. 

Jean  Yawkey' s  life  was  one  of  labor  and  love,  and  now  she 
has  passed  on  to  join  her  husband,  Tom,  whom  she  deeply  loved  and 
sorely  missed  since  his  death  16  years  ago.  Those  who  mourn  her 
passing  should  take  heart  in  knowing  how  much  she  was  looking 
forward  to  the  reunion  with  her  husband.

THE  MANAGER 


On  October  8, 1991  Hobson  signed 
a  two-year  contract  and  became 
the  38th  manager  of  the  Red  Sox. 
1991  was  Hobson’s  first  year 
as  a  AAA  manager.  He  joined  Pawtucket  Jan. 
8, 1991  after  spending  the  previous  two  years 
as  manager  of  AA  New  Britain  (Eastern  L.). 
The  PawSox  made  a  dramatic  turnaround 
under  Hobson,  going  from  last  place  in  1990 
to  first  in  1991,  an  I8-/2  game  improvement. 
As  a  result  Hobson  won  Int.  L.  Manager-of- 
the-Y ear  honors  and  was  selected  by  “Baseball 
America”  as  overall  minor  league  Manager  of 
the  Year. 

Hobson  juggled  41  different  players  (13 
PawSox  were  called  up  to  Boston  during  the 
season)  into  a  79-64  record  and  a  first-place 
finish.  In  the  process  the  PawSox  not  only  set 
an  all-time  attendance  record  at  McCoy 
Stadium  for  the  5th  straight  year,  but  also  they 
went  over  300,000  for  the  fiist  time  (362,342). 
The  PawSox  were  swept  in  three  playoff 
games  by  the  Governor’s  Cup  Champion 
Columbus  Clippers. 

In  1990  Hobson  guided  the  BritSox  to 
the  final  round  of  the  Eastern  L.  playoffs  after 
the  club  finished  in  4th  place  during  the  reg¬ 
ular  season  with  a  72-67  mark.  They  then 
upset  the  league  champion  Albany  Yankees 
three  games  to  two  before  losing  in  the  finals 
three  games  to  none  to  the  London  Tigers. 
The  last  three  falls  he  helped  coach  the  Red 
Sox  Florida  Instructional  League  team.  In  five 
years  as  a  minor  league  manager  Hobson  had 
a  349-345  .503  regular  season  record,  includ¬ 
ing  15 1-1 31  .535  the  last  two  years. 

Butch  returned  to  the  Red  Sox,  where 
he  played  from  1975  through  1980,  as  man¬ 
ager  of  New  Britain  in  1 989.  The  BritSox  were 
8th  in  his  first  season  as  manager  but  finished 
just  6'A  games  behind  4th  place  Reading  with 
a  13-game  improvement  for  a  60-76  record. 
During  that  winter  he  played  3B  for  the 
Winter  Haven  Super  Sox  in  the  Senior  Pro 
League. 

Hobson  also  played  for  the  Angels  in 
1981  and  the  Yankees  in  1982.  In  1983-85  he 
played  for  the  Yankees’  triple  A  team  at 
Columbus  and  was  released  during  spring

training  of  1986.  He  sat  out  that  year  before 
he  became  manager  for  the  Mets’  Class  A  affil¬ 
iate,  Columbia,  in  the  South  Atlantic  L.  in 
1987-88.  In  1988  he  guided  the  Mets  to  a  74- 
63  540  record,  5th  in  the  league.  Columbia 
finished  2nd  during  the  2nd  half  of  the  sea¬ 
son  with  a  36-31  mark.  In  1987  the  team  was 
64-75  .460. 

Butch  played  both  baseball  and  football 
at  the  University  of  Alabama.  He  was  backup 
QB  to  Terry  Davis  for  “Bear”  Bryant’s  “wish¬ 
bone”  offense  in  1972  that  culminated  in  the 
Orange  Bowl  vs.  Nebraska  for  the  national 
championship.  Nebraska  won  the  battle  of 
the  unbeatens,  38-6,  but  Hobson  rushed  15 
times  for  59  yards,  including  a  26-yard  scam¬ 
per.  Butch  was  on  the  varsity  baseball  team 
as  a  freshman,  the  final  season  for  Coach  Joe 
Sewell  who  was  inducted  into  baseball’s  Hall 
of  Fame  in  Cooperstown  in  1976.  Hobson  did 
not  play  baseball  in  1971  but  became  the 
Tide’s  regular  3B  in  1972-73.  He  hit  .282  in 
35  games  as  a  junior  and  then  .317  in  36 
games  as  a  senior  with  13  HR  (most  ever  by 
an  Alabama  player  at  the  time)  and  37  RBI. 
Alabama  finished  22-14  in  1973  and  won  the 
SEC  Western  Division  title.  They  lost  the  play¬ 
offs  two  games  to  one  to  Vanderbilt  for  an 
NCAA  berth. 

Hobson’s  father,  Clell,  Sr.,  was  a  three- 
year  letterman  at  QB  at  Alabama,  1950-52. 
Butch  played  football  for  his  dad  at  Bessemer 
(Ala.)  High  School  and  was  named  to  the  All- 
Jefferson  County  team  as  a  senior.  He  also 
played  basketball  and  baseball  for  Bessemer. 

Butch  was  the  Red  Sox  8th  pick  in  the 
1973  June  draft.  He  played  two  games  with 
the  Red  Sox  at  the  end  of  1975  then  came 
back  again  June  28,  1976.  That  night  he  hit 
an  inside-the-park  HR  in  Fenway  off  Rudy  May 
of  Balt.  From  1977-79  Hobson  hit  75  HR  and 
had  285  RBI.  He  still  holds  Red  Sox  season 
records  for  HR  (30)  and  RBI  (1 12)  for  a  third 
baseman  set  in  1977  when  he  batted  mostly 
ninth.  In  1979  Butch  slammed  28  HR  and  had 
93  RBI.  In  six  seasons  with  the  Red  Sox  he  hit 
.252  in  623  games  with  94  HR  and  358  RBI. 
Eight  M.L.  seasons  produced  a  .248  avg.  with 
98  HR  and  397  RBI.

5/6/86,  Kody  5/31/90. 

Gary  returned  to  the  Red  Sox  in  Boston  as 
bullpen  coach  after  a  seven-year  absence.  Last  year 
he  managed  AA  New  Britain  after  two  seasons  as 
manager  of  Lynchburg  (A,  Carolina  L.).  He  began 
managing  in  the  minors  for  the  Yankees  at 
Oneonta  (NYP)  in  1987-88.  The  last  three  falls  he 
helped  coach  the  Red  Sox  team  in  the  Florida 
Instructional  League. 

Allenson  rejoined  Boston,  where  he  played 
from  1978  through  1984,  when  he  became  man¬ 
ager  of  Lynchburg.  Gary  led  the  L-Sox  to  the  first 
half  title  in  1989,  and  an  overall  70-66  record. 
Lynchburg  was  eliminated  in  the  playoff  semi¬ 
finals  by  eventual  champion  Prince  William.  He 
managed  the  Carolina  L.  North  Division  team  in

In  1988  Gary  led  Oneonta  to  the  NYP  title.  The 
Yankees  finished  with  the  best  record  in  the  NYP, 
48-28  .632,  and  first  place  in  the  McNamara  Div. 
They  beat  Jamestown  2  games  to  none  in  the  play¬ 
offs.  In  1987  Oneonta  finished  2nd,  41-34  .547, 
2  'A  gms.  out  of  first  place. 

Muggsy  was  the  Red  Sox  9th  pick  in  the  1976 
June  draft.  He  helped  lead  Arizona  State  Univ.  to 
the  1975  College  World  Series  where  he  beat

Crofoot  Children:  James  Tyler  10/21/77, 
Chad  11/17/80,  Kyle  3/5/83,  Lauren 
8/21/86. 

Burleson  was  one  of  the  most  popular  Red  Sox 
players  during  the  1970s.  In  1992  he  has  returned 
as  the  club’s  hitting  instructor  after  1 1  years  in 
three  other  organizations.  Rick  spent  the  past  three 
years  with  Oakland,  including  1991  as  their  major 
league  hitting  instructor.  In  1989  he  was  a  roving 
minor  league  infield  instructor,  and  in  1990  he 
moved  into  the  Athletics  scouting  department 
where  he  was  assigned  to  cover  Orange  County 
in  the  Southern  California  area. 

The  “Rooster”  was  the  Red  Sox  first  selection 
in  the  1970  winter  draft,  after  playing  shortstop 
for  the  Connie  Mack  World  Champions  of  1969. 
After  four-plus  minor  league  seasons,  Burleson 
joined  the  Red  Sox  May  4,  1974.  He  committed 
three  errors  in  his  debut  that  night  but  came  back 
the  next  day  with  a  HR,  single  and  three  RBI.  He 
went  on  to  compile  a  lifetime  .273  avg.  during  a 
13-year  major  league  career  with  Boston  (1974- 
80),  California  (1981-86)  and  Baltimore  (1987). 
He  earned  four  All-Star  appearances,  a  Gold  Glove 
in  1979,  twice  won  the  Thomas  A.  Yawkey  team 
MVP  award,  voted  by  the  Boston  Writers,  in  1979- 
80  and  hit  .318  (14-44)  during  two  A.L.C.S.  (1975 
and  ’86)  and  one  World  Series  (1975). 

He  hit  .274  in  seven  years  and  1,031  games 
with  the  Red  Sox,  including  .293  with  194  hits 
in  1977.  He  made  only  eight  throwing  errors  in 
1978-79  and  had  a  .981  fielding  mark  in  1978  that 
tied  for  the  club  SS  record  with  Vem  Stephens 
(1950)  and  Rico  Petrocelli  (1969).  In  1979  he 
took  part  in  two  of  the  three  Red  Sox  triple  plays 
and  committed  just  16  errors  in  81 1  chances. 
He  followed  that  performance  in  1980  by 
leading  A.L.  SS  in  putouts,  assists,  DP’s  (147) 
and  chances/game.

shoulder  rotator  cuff  suffered  in  1982  limited  Rick

hair.  Bats  and  Throws:  Right.  Home: 
Durham,  NH.  Married:  Susan  Knorr. 
Children:  Christopher  2/5/82,  Andrew 
11/28/85,  Alexander  9/11/88. 

Gale  made  his  debut  as  the  Red  Sox  pitching 
coach  in  1992.  He  got  his  pro  coaching  baptism 
in  1989  under  Butch  Hobson  at  AA  New  Britain, 
then  moved  with  Hobson  to  AAA  Pawtucket  in 
1991. 

The  1991  PawSox  led  the  I.L.  with  49  saves 
and  were  second  in  fewest  walks  allowed  despite 
using  23  pitchers,  including  17  as  starters.  Gale 
had  to  continually  juggle  the  staff,  but  they  held 
together  for  a  79-64  record  and  a  first-place  finish 
in  the  I.L.  Eastern  Division. 

In  1990  his  New  Britain  moundsmen  tied  for 
the  league  lead  with  a  3. 17  ERA  and  38  saves,  were 
second  with  16  shutouts  and  tied  for  the  second 
least  walks  allowed.  Gale  twice  took  the  mound 
himself  in  1989  at  New  Britain  in  emergency  sit¬ 
uations  and  allowed  just  one  run  in  5. 1  IP.  He  had 
a  similar  situation  in  1991  for  Pawtucket  and 
hurled  5.2  IP  (4H,  1R,  IBB,  IK).  In  the  fall  of  1989 
he  went  to  Russia  on  the  Eastern  L.  Diamond 
Diplomacy  USSR  Tour,  then  pitched  for  Fort  Myers 
in  the  Senior  Pro  League. 

Rich  spent  seven  seasons  in  the  majors  with 
Kansas  City  (1978-81),  San  Francisco  (1982), 
Cincinnati  (1983)  and  the  Red  Sox  (1984).  He 
played  in  Japan  with  the  Hanshin  Tigers  in  1985- 
86.  He  was  drafted  by  the  Royals  in  the  5th  round 
of  the  1975  June  draft  and  had  an  outstanding 
rookie  campaign  in  1978.  He  was  148,  3.09  in  31 
games  and  was  named  Sporting  News  A.L.  Rookie 
Pitcher  of  the  Year  and  to  the  Topps  and  Baseball 
Digest  M.L.  All-Rookie  teams. 

Gale  signed  with  the  Red  Sox  Feb.  24,  1984 
after  his  release  from  Cincinnati.  He  was  9-5,  2.79 
at  Pawtucket  that  season  and  2-3, 5.56  in  13  games 
with  the  Red  Sox.  He  returned  to  his  alma  mater, 
the  University  of  New  Hampshire,  to  get  his 
degree  in  1988  and  also  served  as  the  Wildcats 
pitching  coach.  Prior  to  being  drafted  by  the 
Royals,  he  pitched  three  years  at  UNH  (1973-75) 
and  still  holds  the  school  record  for  most  strike¬ 
outs  in  a  game,  17  in  1973.

ing  33  in  the  major  leagues,  13  as  a  manager. 

On  July  19, 1976  Zim  replaced  Darrell  Johnson

304  .575  record  that  included  three  straight  years 
of  90-plus  wins,  1977-79.  Zimmer  was  let  go  as 
Sox  manager  with  an  82-73  record  and  four  games 
left  in  1980.  He  went  on  to  manage  Texas  (1981- 
82)  and  the  Chicago  Cubs  (1988-91)  with  stops 
in  between  as  a  coach  for  the  New  York  Yankees 
(1983  and  1986),  the  Cubs  (1984-86)  and  San 
Francisco  (1987).  He  was  third  base  coach  in  the 
N.L.C.S.  with  the  Cubs  in  1984  and  the  Giants 
in  1987,  and  for  the  Red  Sox  when  they  went  to

coached  for  Montreal  (1971)  and  San  Diego 
(1972).  On  April  27, 1972  he  replaced  Preston 
Gomez  as  the  Padres’  manager  and  held  that 
position  for  two  years. 

In  1989  Zimmer  was  a  near-unanimous  choice 
as  N.L.  Manager  of  the  Year  by  the  BBWAA  (23  of 
24  first-place  votes)  after  leading  the  Cubs  to 
the  Eastern  Div.  title.  He  became  a  minor  league 
manager  in  1967  in  the  Cincinnati  organization, 
and  after  three  seasons,  joined  Montreal  as  a 
coach  in  1971.

Zimmer  started  his  pro  career  in  1949  as  a 
shortstop  in  the  Dodger  system.  In  1953  he  was 
leading  the  American  Association  in  HR  (23)  and 
RBI  (63)  at  St.  Paul  when  he  was  struck  in  the  head 
by  Jim  Kirk  of  Columbus  July  7,  and  missed  the 
rest  of  the  season.  In  1954  he  began  a  12-year 
major  league  career  with  the  Dodgers,  Cubs,  Mets, 
Reds  and  Washington  Senators.  He  had  to  over¬ 
come  another  injury  when  he  got  a  cheekbone 
fracture  June  23, 1956  on  a  pitch  from  Haljefifcoat 
of  the  Reds  that  again  disabled  him  for  the  year 
while  playing  for  Brooklyn.  He  was  the  Dodgers 
second  baseman  in  the  final  game  of  the  1955 
World  Series,  won  by  Johnny  Podres  2-0  over  the 
Yankees. 

During  his  M.L.  career  Zim  played  second, 
third,  shortstop,  the  outfield  and  even  caught  in 
35  games  for  the  Senators.  He  was  selected  by  the 
Mets  from  the  Cubs  in  the  N.L.  expansion  draft  in 
1961 .  He  ended  his  playing  career  with  the  Toei 
Flyers  in  1966  in  Japan.  On  opening  day  in  I960, 
his  first  game  with  the  Cubs,  he  homered  off  the 
Dodgers  Don  Drysdale  before  67,500  in  the  L.A.

Simmons  in  his  first  M.L.  at-bat  in  1954,  and  hit  a 
two-run  HR  for  the  Senators  in  1963  in  his  first 
A.L.  at-bat.

runs  with  63  stolen  bases  (10  of  home  plate)  in 
124  games  for  Homell  (Class  D,  PONY  L.).

In  the  summer  of  1 990  if  somebody 
told  Joe  Hesketh  he  would 
become  one  of  the  better  left- 
handed  starters  in  the  American 
League  the  following  season,  he  might 
have  had  a  good  laugh. 

Not  that  he  didn’t  have  the  con¬ 
fidence  in  himself,  to  the  contrary. 
He  did,  but  nobody  else  seemed  to 
believe  in  him. 

It  was  the  middle  of  the  baseball 
season,  and  the  33-year-old  lefthander 
was  sitting  at  home  in  Palm  Harbor, 
Florida.  He  had  been  released  by  the 
Montreal  Expos  on  April  25  after  only 
two  relief  appearances.  Five  days  later 
he  was  picked  up  by  the  Atlanta  Braves 
and  after  31  appearances,  they  cut 
him  loose  three  months  later  on  July 
24. 

“I’d  have  to  say  I  thought  it  was 
the  end.  After  Atlanta  let  me  go  I 
didn’t  think  I  was  going  to  continue 
my  career.  I  just  felt  it  might  be  best 
for  me  to  go  on  and  try  something 
else,”  he  recalled. 

Then  the  phone  rang  and 
Hesketh’s  career  was  re-bom.  He 
found  out  not  everybody  had  given 
up  on  him. 

The  voice  on  the  other  end  was 
Red  Sox  General  Manager  Lou 
Gorman.  He  was  looking  for  a 
lefthander  for  the  bullpen  and  had 
good  reports  on  Hesketh.

RED  SOX 


Rookies 

by  John  Grabowski 


The  odds  are  great  against  a 
player  achieving  stardom  in 
his  first  season  in  the  big 
leagues,  but  the  dream  still 
bums  deep  within  the  heart  of  every 
rookie  who  laces  on  a  pair  of  spikes.  To 
stick  with  the  “big  club,”  and  go  on  to 
win  honors  as  the  outstanding  fresh¬ 
man  in  the  league,  is  a  feat  accom¬ 
plished  by  only  two  of  the  150  or  so 
players  who  enter  onto  the  scene  each 
year. 

Since  an  award  for  the  top  rookie 
was  first  given  out  by  the  Baseball  Writ¬ 
ers'  Association  in  1947,  only  four  Red 
Sox  players  have  won  the  honor  — 
Walt  Dropo  in  1950,  Don  Schwall  in 
1961,  Carlton  Fisk  in  1972,  and  Fred 
Lynn  in  1975. 

But  the  list  of  outstanding  Red  Sox 
rookies  doesn’t  end  with  those  four.  In 
fact,  if  an  all-star  team  of  Boston  rookies 
is  picked,  Schwall  would  not  even  be 
on  it. 

At  first  base,  Dropo  is  the  choice. 
Following  an  impressive  1 1-game  cup 
of  coffee  with  the  1949  club,  “Moose” 
hit  the  floor  running  in  1950.  He  was 
the  American  League  All-Star  first 
baseman  and  went  on  to  hit  .322,  and 


Don  Schwall 


Johnny  Pesky 


tied  with  Vem  Stephens  with  a  league¬ 
leading  1 44  RBI.  His  326  total  bases  also 
led  the  circuit,  while  his  34  home  runs 
and  .583  slugging  percentage  were  good 
for  second  in  the  A.  L.  Curiously  enough, 
the  player  Dropo  forced  off  first,  team¬ 
mate  Billy  Goodman,  batted  .354  in  a 
utility  role  to  lead  the  league  in  hitting. 
Two  years  earlier,  Goodman  had  bro¬ 
ken  in  as  a  rookie  with  a  .310  average 
and  66  runs  batted  in. 

The  top  performance  at  the  key¬ 
stone  sack  is  of  more  recent  vintage.  In 
1980,  Dave  Stapleton  trailed  only  Joe 
Charboneau  of  Cleveland  in  Rookie  of 
the  Year  balloting,  leading  the  Sox  with 
an  average  of  .321,  while  stroking  7 
homers  and  driving  in  45  runs.  Unfortu¬ 
nately,  he  never  again  reached  those 
heights.  His  average  dropped  in  each  of 
his  succeeding  six  seasons,  bottoming 
out  at  .128  in  1986.  Marty  Barrett  (.303, 
3, 45  in  1984)  and  Larry  Gardner  (.283, 
2,  36  in  1910)  also  merit  recognition. 


Competition  at  the  hot  comer  is 
stiff,  with  players  such  as  Joe  Foy  (.262, 
15,  63  in  1966)  and  Glenn  Hoffman 
(.285, 4, 42  in  1980)  laying  claim  to  the 
spot.  The  nod  here,  however,  goes  to 
Jim  Tabor,  whose . 289  average,  1 4  home 
runs,  and  95  RBI  in  1939  were  over¬ 
shadowed  by  the  remarkable  totals  put 
up  by  another  Boston  rookie.  But  more 
about  him  later.  Some  might  question 
why  Wade  Boggs  is  not  penciled  in, 
pointing  to  his  .349  average  in  1982. 
The  reason,  simply,  is  that  he  played 
more  games  at  first  base  that  year  (49) 
than  at  third  (44).  He  did  not  become 
the  full-time  third  sacker  until  the  fol¬ 
lowing  year. 

At  shortstop,  we  findjohnny  Pesky. 
As  a  rookie  in  1942,  he  led  the  league  in 
hits  with  205,  while  finishing  second  to 
teammate  Ted  Williams  in  batting  at 
.331.  After  missing  the  next  three  years 
due  to  the  war,  Pesky  returned  and, 
remarkably,  proceeded  to  lead  the  A.L. 
in  hits  each  of  his  first  two  seasons 
back.  His  batting  averages  were  .335 
and  .324. 

Catching  chores  fall  into  the  ca¬ 
pable  hands  of  Carlton  Fisk.  “Pudge”

won  the  1972  Rookie  of  the  Year  Award, 
in  a  unanimous  vote,  on  the  strength  of 
22  home  runs,  61  runs  batted  in,  a  .293 
B.A.,  and  a  league-leading  9  triples.  His 
leadership  role  behind  the  plate  helped 
the  club  to  a  second-place  finish,  just 
one-half  game  behind  the  Detroit  Ti¬ 
gers.  Who  would  have  thought  that 
today,  20  years  later,  Fisk  is  still  per¬ 
forming  his  brand  of  magic,  albeit  for 
the  Western  Division  Chicago  White 
Sox?  Runner-up  honors  go  to  Sammy 
White,  who  impressed  as  a  rookie  20 
years  before  Fisk.  White  batted  .282  for 
the  1952  squad,  cracking  10  round- 
trippers  and  driving  home  49  runs. 

Outstanding  freshman  perfor¬ 
mances  by  Boston  outfielders  are  plen¬ 
tiful,  dating  back  to  Patsy  Dougherty  in 
the  A.L.’s  second  season.  Dougherty 
batted  .342  in  1902,  the  fourth  best 
mark  in  the  league.  More  recently,  Dom 


Ted  Williams 


DiMaggio  (.301,  8,  46  in  1940),  Sam 
Mele  (.302,  12,  73  in  1947),  Tony 
Conigliaro  (.290,  24,  52  in  1964)  and 
Carl  Yastrzemski(. 266,  11,  80  in  1961) 
have  excelled.  The  picks  here,  how¬ 
ever,  are  Ted  Williams,  Fred  Lynn,  and 
Mike  Greenwell. 

Hall  of  Famer  Williams  burst  onto 
the  scene  in  1939.  He  led  the  league  in 
runs  batted  in  (145)  and  total  bases 
(344),  finished  second  in  runs  scored 
(131),  bases  on  balls  (107)  and  doubles 
(44),  third  in  home  runs  (31),  and  fourth 
in  slugging  percentage  (.609).  He  bat¬ 
ted  .327,  and  undoubtedly  would  have 
won  the  rookie  award  had  one  been  in 
existence  at  the  time. 

Lynn  did  win  the  award  in  1975, 
accomplishing  something  no  one  has 
done  before  or  since.  He  batted  .331,

with  21  four-baggers,  105  ribbies,  and 
league-leading  figures  in  doubles  (47) 
and  slugging  (.566).  In  leading  the  Sox 
to  the  American  League  pennant,  he 
was  voted  Most  Valuable  Player,  the 
only  man  to  win  the  honor  in  his  maiden 
season. 

Third  spot  in  the  pasture  goes  to 
Greenwell,  who  debuted  in  1987  fol¬ 
lowing  brief  stints  the  previous  two 
years.  Greenwell  hit  .328,  bashed  19 
homers,  and  brought  home  89  runs, 
while  coming  to  the  plate  412  official 
times.  His  numbers  were  overshadowed 
by  Mark  McGwire’s  49  home  runs,  and 
Greenwell  finished  fourth  in  the  ballot¬ 
ing  for  the  rookie  award. 

Despite  Lynn’s  M.V.P.  trophy,  he 
was  not  the  unanimous  winner  in  the 
rookie  vote.  One  player  received  one- 
half  of  a  vote,  thus  preventing  a  sweep. 
That  player  was  Lynn’s  teammate,  Jim 
Rice.  Rice’s  impressive  .309  average, 
22  home  runs,  and  102  RBI  make  him 
hard  to  leave  off  our  club,  so  let’s  stick 
him  in  as  designated  hitter. 

A  team  with  all  this  firepower  is 
sure  to  win  its  share  of  games  with  any 
sort  of  pitching  at  all.  We’ll  limit  our¬ 
selves  to  two  starters  and  two  relievers 
to  complete  our  team. 

From  the  right  side,  our  choice 
boils  down  to  two  20-game  winners. 
The  numbers  are  nearly  identical  for 
Hugh  Bedient  (20-9,  2.92  in  1912)  and 
Boo  Ferriss  (21-10,  2.96  in  1945).  The 
pick  here  is  Ferriss,  who  tossed  five 
shutouts  among  his  26  complete  games, 
and  hurled  264.2  innings.  Bedient  had 
more  strikeouts  in  fewer  innings,  as  the 
Sox  won  the  A.L.  pennant  by  14  games. 
Ferriss’  team  finished  in  seventh  place, 
17-1/2  games  off  the  pace.  Dick 
Newsome  won  19  games  for  Boston  in 
1941  to  merit  some  consideration,  but 
a  relatively  high  4.13  ERA  eliminates 
him  from  contention.

The  southpaw  starter  for  our  nine 
should  receive  no  argument.  The  im¬ 
mortal  “Bambino,”  Babe  Ruth,  com¬ 
piled  an  18-8  log  for  the  pennant- win¬ 
ning  1915  team,  allowing  only  2.44 
earned  runs  per  contest.  His  bat  comes 
in  handy,  too.  In  only  92  official  trips  to 
the  plate,  he  led  Boston  in  home  runs, 
with  four,  and  hit  .315. 

Our  bullpen  is  manned  by  none 
other  than  Dick  Radatz.  “The  Monster” 
broke  in  in  1962  with  a  league-leading 
62  appearances  and  24  saves.  The  six- 
foot,  six-inch  righthander  struck  fear 
into  the  hearts  of  opposing  batters, 
fanning  144  in  just  under  125  innings. 
His  left-handed  counterpart  in  the  pen 


Mike  Greenwell 


is  Albert  Walter  “Sparky”  Lyle,  who  first 
saw  the  light  of  big  league  day  in  1967. 
Although  he  appeared  in  only  27  games, 
Lyle  gave  indication  of  things  to  come 
by  notching  5  saves  and  posting  a  2.28 
ERA  in  43.1  IP  of  work. 

Well,  there  you  have  it.  Fourteen 
Red  Sox  who  beat  the  odds  and  went 
on  to  star  in  their  rookie  big  league 
campaigns.  Only  time  will  tell  if  anyone 
currently  toiling  in  the  minors  will  some¬ 
day  supplant  one  of  the  above  players. 

But  even  if  they  don’t,  the  numbers 
posted  by  these  Red  Sox  rookies  will 
always  stand  out  among  the  top  first- 
year  performances  in  big  league  his¬ 
tory.

THE  IMPOSSIBLE  DREAM 
PART  II 


The  Dream  Builds 

by  Saul  E.  Wisnia 


The  promise  of  spring  had  gone 
unnoticed.  The  Boston  Red 
Sox,  perennial  losers,  began 
1967  with  a  fiery  new  man¬ 
ager  in  Dick  Williams  and  a  refreshing 
style  of  play.  Most  experts  still  felt  the 
youthful  group  had  no  chance,  and 
even  a  1 4-1 2  exhibition  record  failed  to 
impress  the  Las  Vegas  oddsmakers.  The 
Sox  were  a  100-1  shot,  expected  to 
provide  a  little  excitement  and  not  much 
else. 

But  something  set  this  team  apart 
from  the  ninth-place  finishers  that  pre¬ 
ceded  it.  Young  veterans  Carl 
Yastrzemski,  Jim  Lonborg  and  Tony 
Conigliaro  were  sick  of  losing,  and 
Williams  had  no  intention  of  continu¬ 
ing  the  trend.  When  rookie  lefthander 
Billy  Rohr  came  within  one  pitch  of  a 
no-hitter  in  his  major  league  debut  April 
14,  it  was  the  first  sign  something  spe¬ 
cial  was  about  to  happen. 

An  Impossible  Dream. 

It  didn’t  happen  overnight.  Follow¬ 
ing  Rohr’s  masterpiece,  the  Sox  were 
quickly  deflated  in  a  1-0  loss  to  Mel 
Stottlemyre.  Next  was  a  7-6  setback  in 
18  innings  during  which  Boston  blew 
1 3  chances  to  knock  in  the  winning  run 
from  second  or  third.  First  baseman 
George  Scott,  an  All-Star  in  ’66,  now 
battling  to  keep  his  weight  down  and 
job  intact,  went  l-for-8,  missed  a  “take” 
sign  on  a  3-0  pitch,  and  received  a  $50 
fine  from  Williams. 

Dick  was  fuming.  The  team  flew  to 
Chicago  following  the  game,  arrived 
past  midnight,  but  was  on  the  field  for 
an  early  workout  the  next  day.  Stating 
that,  “Talking  with  Scott  is  like  talking 
to  cement,”  Williams  benched  the  .185 
hitter  in  favor  of  Tony  Horton.  Horton 
fielded  abysmally  in  another  Boston 
loss,  and  third  baseman  Joe  Foy  (.083 
and  10  pounds  overweight)  was  seated 
next.  Foy  took  to  fasting,  and  veteran 
columnist  Harold  Kaese  of  the  Globe 
offered  advice:  “The  Sox  are  a  long  way 
from  being  perfect,  and  nobody  —  es¬ 
pecially  Williams  —  should  expect  them 
to  be  perfect.” 


Fans  worried  for  his  sanity,  but 
Dick  proved  the  perfect  manager  for 
this  club.  The  Sox  were  youthful  (aver¬ 
age  age  24),  impressionable,  and  far 
from  rich.  Foy  had  been  playing  25 
months  straight,  including  two  winters 
in  the  Caribbean,  simply  because  he 
needed  the  money.  “If  I  stayed  at  home, 
I’d  work  from  8  to  5  for  $75  a  week,”  he 
said.  “Down  there  I  play  four  or  five 
games  a  week  and  get  a  better  pay- 
check.” 

Shortstop  Rico  Petrocelli  was  mak¬ 
ing  $9000,  and  agonized  over  putting  a 
down  payment  on  a  house.  Reliever 
John  Wyatt  had  all  his  money  tied  up  in 
real  estate  ventures.  Rookie  Reggie 
Smith  knew  things  would  improve  fol¬ 
lowing  a  .162  start  —  if  only  he  could 
raise  enough  to  move  his  wife  to  Bos¬ 
ton.  The  team  payroll  was  $850,000 
(topped  by  Yastrzemski’ s  $58,000),  but 
most  fans  couldn’t  care  less. 

Only  Rohr’s  numbers  made  head¬ 
lines.  A  $500  raise  following  his  near¬ 
gem  raised  his  salary  to  $7000,  and  a 
guest  spot  on  Ed  Sullivan  brought  an¬ 
other  $500.  The  fame  was  fleeting.  Billy 
went  the  distance  in  winning  his  next 
start,  but  after  several  poor  outings, 
was  gone  to  Toronto  by  June  —  never 


Bill  Rohr’s  major  league  debut  would  be 
talked  about  for  years. 


to  win  another  game  in  the  majors.  A 
classic  one-month  wonder,  Rohr’s  mo¬ 
ment  of  glory  had  catapulted  an  entire 
team  of  over-achievers. 

In  Washington,  Frank  Howard  hit  a 
homer  off  Boston’s  Dennis  Bennett  that 
traveled  480  feet,  but  the  Red  Sox  scored 
the  winning  runs  when  Mike  Andrews 
hit  a  90-foot  drive  that  bounced  off  first 
baseman  Ken  Harrelson’s  knee  into  foul 
territory.  Trailing  Kansas  City  in  the 
15th  inning,  they  prevailed  1 1-10  on  a 
pinch-single  by  weak-hitting  Jose 
T artabull.  The  Sox  were  playing  a  brand 
of  baseball  not  seen  at  Fenway  Park  for 
years,  and  finished  April  8-6,  in  3rd 
place,  one  game  behind  Detroit. 

May  began  less  promisingly,  as  a 
team-wide  slump  prompted  nine  losses 
in  12  games.  Surprising  nobody,  Wil¬ 
liams  made  more  shake-ups.  Declaring 
“I  don’t  care  how  much  they’re  earn¬ 
ing,  I’m  trying  to  win  ball  games,”  he 
benched  the  slipping  Yastrzemski  and 
put  third-stringer  George  Thomas  in 
left  against  the  Twins.  When  Thomas 
was  forced  to  leave  the  game  with  a 
dislocated  finger,  Tartabull  helped  start 
the  final  rally  of  a  9-5  victory. 

The  next  day,  Williams  announced 
he  was  sitting  Conigliaro  and  Smith  for 
a  doubleheader  against  Kansas  City. 
Petrocelli  was  now  the  only  player  not 
benched  in  the  first  20  games.  “I’m 
here  to  win,”  said  Dick.  “Not  to  see 
how  many  friends  I  can  make.”  Wil¬ 
liams  later  changed  his  mind  on 
Conigliaro,  and  Tony  responded  by  hit¬ 
ting  a  three-run  homer. 

Success  grew  contagious.  Winning 
the  second  game  of  a  doubleheader 
sweep  over  Detroit  a  few  days  later, 
Jose  Santiago  threw  147  pitches  and  hit 
three  others  for  a  homer,  double,  and 
sacrifice  fly.  “What  do  you  want  to  talk 
about?”  the  smiling  Santiago  asked  re¬ 
porters,  “My  hitting  or  my  pitching?” 
The  Sox  gained  no  ground  on  first- 
place  Chicago,  but  moved  from  eighth 
place  to  third  in  one  afternoon.

NO  HOME  RUN  PARADISE

able  drop  in  home  run  production.  The 
theory  most  often  put  forth  for  this  is 
the  change  the  addition  made  in  the 
out-blowing  wind  currents  over  the 
field. 

When  the  scoreboard  was  erected 
in  center  field,  similar  wind  shift  effects 
occurred,  and  the  then  centerfielder, 
Fred  Lynn,  found  it  took  him  the  early 
season  period  to  adjust  to  the  new 
pattern  of  wind  flow. 

Fenway  opened  in  1 9 1 2 ,  and  while 
it  was  accepted  as  the  latest  in  ballpark 
design,  it  was  not  the  most  spacious 


park  in  the  American  League.  Even 
though  the  present  bullpens  in  right 
field  were  missing,  and  there  was  greater 
open  space  in  the  triangle  area  of  cen¬ 
ter  field,  it  was  not  the  largest  of  major 
league  parks.  There  was  the  famous 
“Duffy’s  Cliff’  in  left  field  —  a  rather 
steep  embankment  in  front  of  the  left- 
field  wall. 

In  the  dead  ball  era,  a  number  of 
the  home  runs  were  of  the  inside-the- 
park  variety  and  naturally  were  hit  in 


For  years  Red  Sox  fans  have  been 
led  to  believe  that  Fenway  Park 
is  a  home  run  hitter’s  paradise. 
There  may  have  been  years  when  this 
was  true,  but  a  closer  look  at  the  record 
gives  us  a  different  perspective.  The 
fact  that  the  venerable  old  Boston  land¬ 
mark  was  not  especially  friendly  to  Red 
Sox  batters  until  the  1920s,  when  the 
live  ball  era  descended  upon  baseball, 
is  often  overlooked  by  baseball  histori¬ 
ans.  There  has  also  been,  since  the 
erection  of  the  “600”  Club  and  the  new 
press  box  behind  home  plate,  a  notice-

the  parks  with  the  more  spacious  out¬ 
fields.  Until  Babe  Ruth  came  along, 
many  of  the  Sox  homers  were  hit  on  the 
road,  although  it  is  uncertain  how  many 
went  “over  the  fence.”  It  was  also  true 
that  as  large  overflow  crowds  filled  the 
ballparks,  fans  were  allowed  on  the 
fields  behind  roped-off  areas.  Various 
ground  rules  were  in  effect,  and  balls 
hit  “over  the  ropes”  and  into  the  crowds 
were  valued  as  doubles,  triples,  or  home 
runs  depending  upon  the  local  rules. 

As  testimony  to  the  often  crowded 
field  conditions,  Smokeyjoe  Wood,  the 
Sox  ace  pitcher  of  the  1912  champion¬ 
ship  team,  told  me  many  times  of  his 
famous  pitching  duel  with  the  great 
Walter  Johnson  of  the  Washington  Sena¬ 
tors  and  how  the  crowds  surrounded 
him  as  he  took  his  warm-up  pitches  just 
outside  the  dugout  area.  It  was  the 
custom  then  that  the  starting  pitchers 
warmed  up  close  by  the  stands  in  the 
home  plate  area.  Many  readers  will  re¬ 
call  seeing  the  well  publicized  photo  of 
Joe  Wood  warming  up  surrounded  by 
the  crowd.  It  was  at  that  famous  game 
that  the  benches  were  moved  close  by 
the  foul  lines  so  the  crowd  could  stand 
behind  them. 

In  all,  the  1912  Red  Sox  hit  29 
home  runs,  1 0  of  them  coming  at  home. 
Among  the  10  was  Hugh  Bradley’s  of 
April  26  off  Philadelphia’s  Lefty  Russell, 
a  seventh-inning  blast  over  the  wall 
with  two  teammates  aboard.  It  was 
Fenway  Park’s  first  home  run.  Hall  of 
Famer  Tris  Speaker  tied  Philadelphia’s 
Home  Run  Baker  for  the  league  lead 
with  10  round  trippers,  four  of  which 
were  hit  at  Fenway.  The  previous  sea¬ 
son  the  Sox  had  hit  20  home  runs  at 
their  old  home  field  on  Huntington 
Ave.,  and  35  overall.  The  Huntington 
Ave.  Grounds  had  a  more  spacious  out¬ 
field. 


In  1913  the  home  run  output 
dropped  to  just  17,  but  of  those  only  3 
came  at  Fenway.  Harry  Hooper,  Heinie 
Wagner  and  Clyde  Engle  were  the  lucky 
trio.  The  1914  club  was  one  better, 
clouting  18  circuit  smashes,  but  again 
only  3  were  hit  at  Fenway  —  Larry 
Gardner,  Olaf  Henriksen,  and  Del  Gainor 
accomplished  the  feat,  the  last  two 
coming  on  October  6  and  7  at  the  tail 
end  of  the  season.  Can  you  imagine 
only  six  home  runs  at  Fenway  in  two 
years? 

The  1915  World  Champion  Red 
Sox  saw  their  homer  production  drop 
to  only  14,  however,  their  Fenway  pro¬ 
duction  curiously  almost  doubled  as 
five  round  trippers  found  their  way  out 
of  the  park.  Two  of  the  five  were  hit  by 
pitchers  Joe  Wood  and  Babe  Ruth.  The 
season  also  marked  Babe’s  first  ever 
major  league  home  run,  that  coming  as 
he  led  off  the  third  inning  at  New  York 
in  the  Polo  Grounds  on  May  6  off  Yan- 


“Smokey”  Joe  Wood. 


kee  righthander  Jack  Warhop,  a  long 
blast  to  right  field. 

World  Champions  again  in  1916, 
their  home  run  production  remained  at 
14  with  an  almost  unbelievable  one  hit 
at  home.  That’s  right,  one  Red  Sox 
home  run  all  season  at  Fenway.  That 
shot  came  off  the  bat  of  Tilly  Walker  on 
June  20  against  New  York  righthander 
Ray  Keating  in  the  seventh  inning  with 
no  one  on  base.  Walker,  Ruth  and  Gainor 
all  tied  with  three  apiece  to  lead  the 
team. 

While  the  1917  club  didn’t  match 
the  World  Champions  of  ’  1 5  and  ’  16  by 
bringing  home  the  pennant,  they  con¬ 
tinued  the  home  run  output  at  1 4  —  the 
third  consecutive  year  at  that  count. 
This  time  only  three  were  Fenway  Park 
jobs  with  Larry  Gardner,  Harry  Hooper 
and  Babe  Ruth  capturing  the  homers. 

The  1918  club  brought  another 
championship  to  Boston  and  broke  the 
14  homer  cycle  by  gamering  15  circuit 
clouts  for  the  year,  but  did  little  for  the 
home  fans,  as  only  two  were  hit  at 
Fenway:  Harry  Hooper  off  Detroit’s  Bill 
James  on  May  16  and  Jack  Coffey  off  St. 
Louis’  A1  Sothoron  on  August  21.  By 
now  Babe  Ruth  was  beginning  to  show 
his  power  as  he  had  1 1  of  the  1 5  that  the 
team  hit. 

Oh  my,  what  happened  in  1919? 
The  Sox  had  33  home  runs  of  which 
Ruth  had  29,  a  new  season  record  for 
home  runs.  Besides  Ruth,  Hooper  had  3 
and  Stuffy  Mclnnis  had  one  to  account 
for  all  the  team’s  homers.  The  dead  ball 
era  was  about  to  end,  and  the  lively  ball 
was  about  to  arrive.  That  winter  Sox 
owner  Harry  Frazee  sold  Babe  Ruth  to 
the  New  York  Yankees,  but  except  for 
a  dip  in  1920,  the  Sox  never  again 
approached  the  low  home  run  output 
of  the  early  years  at  Fenway  Park.

FORMER  RED  SOX  STARS 


WHERE  ARE  THEY  NOW? 


by  Dick  Dew 


Wore  No.  9,  1937; 
No.  1,  1938-44,  1946-31 


THEN:  In  his  prime  he  performed  quietly 
and  efficiently  before  millions  of  fans,  compil¬ 
ing  often  spectacular  statistics  and  earning 
the  respect  of  those  who  watched  him  and 
those  who  played  with  him. 

And  while  Robert  Pershing  “Bobby”  Doerr 
played  from  1937  through  1931,  he  is  still 
among  the  top  five  in  1 1  of  the  Boston  Red  Sox 
career  statistical  categories,  a  feat  that  was  recog¬ 
nized  by  his  periodic  selection  as  the  best  second 
baseman  ever  to  play  regularly  at  Fenway  Park  and, 
finally,  for  elevation  to  the  Baseball  Hall  of  Fame  by 
the  Veteran’s  Selection  Committee  in  1987. 

Doerr,  whose  playing  career  was  cut  short  in 
his  prime  at  age  33  by  a  back  injury,  batted  .289 
in  106  games  with  73  runs  batted  in  and  1 3  home 
runs  in  his  final  season  as  a  player  and  still  wishes 
he  could  have  played  more  games  in  that  painful 
1951  season. 

“They  told  me  I  needed  a  fusion  operation  and 
there  were  no  guarantees,  but  that  I  could  live  a 
normal  life  without  it.  I  had  14  good  years  with  the 
Red  Sox  and  probably  my  best  season  in  1950,  so  I 
decided  against  it.” 

Doerr,  who  played  all  but  13  of  his  1,865  career 
games  at  second  base  for  the  Red  Sox,  retired  with  a 
.288  career  batting  average,  223  home  runs,  1,247 
runs  batted  in,  381  career  doubles  and  an  impres¬ 
sive  89  career  triples.  In  1950,  he  batted  .294  in 
146  games  with  27  homers  and  120  RBI.

DOERR 


He  was  a  nine-time  all-star  selec¬ 
tion,  a  five-time  starter,  is  still  the  club’s 
all-time  leader  for  games  at  second  base , 
coached  hitting  for  10  years  in  Boston’s 
farm  system  and  worked  as  a  major 
league  batting  coach  for  Dick  Williams 
during  the  Impossible  Dream  year  of 
1967  and  through  1969.  He  came  back 
from  1977  to  1981  as  a  coach  with  the 
expansion  Toronto  Blue  Jays. 

NOW  !a  native  of  Los  Angeles, 
Bobby  Doerr  was  introduced  to  Or¬ 
egon  as  a  teenager  by  the  trainer  of  the 
Hollywood  franchise  in  the  Pacific  Coast 
League. 

“He  used  to  come  up  here  with  his 
wife  during  the  off-season  to  spend  the 
winter  on  the  Rogue  River.  He’d  show 
me  pictures  of  fish  and  deer,  so  I  came 
up  to  spend  a  winter  with  them. 

“In  those  days,  you  had  to  take  a 
boat  up  the  river,  there  were  no  roads, 
and  I  liked  it  so  much  I  have  come  back 
every  winter  since  then.  I  met  my  wife 
up  here,  she  was  teaching  in  a  one- 
room  schoolhouse,  we  got  acquainted 
and  married. 

“We  have  a  home  near  Eugene,  but 
up  here  (Junction  City,  OR)  you  can 
look  in  any  direction  and  see  nothing 
but  mountains.  My  nearest  neighbor  is 
only  150  yards  away,  but  for  another 
neighbor,  you’ve  got  to  go  a  mile.” 

Doerr  caught  a  25-pound  salmon 
to  mark  his  74th  birthday  earlier  this 
year,  and  while  he  was  on  the  river  he 
saw  a  herd  of  1 5  to  20  elk.  Even  though 
they  have  “three  or  four  roads  in  here 
now,”  the  area  is  still  noted  for  its  deer 
and  wild  turkeys  as  well  as  for  the 
salmon. 

If  Bobby’s  love  for  fishing  sounds 
familiar,  it  is  probably  because  he  was 
signed  by  Red  Sox  scout  Eddie  Collins 
in  1936  while  Collins  was  visiting  the 
west  coast  to  sign  another  eventual  Hall 
of  Famer  named  Ted  Williams. 


“I  had  broken  into  the  Pacific  Coast 
League  real  young  and  played  with  some 
older  players  that  had  come  down  from 
the  majors.  I  got  a  break  and  played 
second  base,  a  position  that  I  liked. 
Shortstop  was  the  big  position,  but  I 
always  felt  I  was  lucky  the  way  it  went. 

“Being  named  to  the  Hall  of  Fame 
turned  my  life  around.  Now,  there’s 
something  going  on  all  the  time.  It  is  an 
honor  that  I  never  expected  to  happen, 
it’s  just  something  to  be  in  a  fraternity 
like  that. 

“  I  am  perfectly  happy  to  have  been 
selected  by  the  veteran’s  committee. 
It’s  the  ultimate  honor  of  my  baseball 
life.  Now,  I  go  to  two  or  three  old 
timers’  games  a  year,  and  I  go  to  card 
shows  to  sign  autographs. 

“I  still  go  to  golf  tournaments, 
though  I  don’t  play  much  any  more.  I 
think  I’ve  only  played  once  in  the  last 
two  years.  The  nearest  golf  course  is  30 
miles  away.  I  enjoy  fishing  most.” 


MEMORIES:  You  can  hear 

the  emotion  in  Bobby  Doerr’ s  voice 
even  today  when  he  talks  about  the 
Yawkeys  and  Fenway  Park. 

“The  first  thing  that  happened 
when  I  got  to  Boston  was  Joe  Cronin 
took  me  from  the  office  into  the  back  of 
the  stands  for  my  first  look  at  Fenway. 
I  had  been  in  the  Coast  League  for  three 
years.  I  had  never  seen  a  major  league 
park,  and  that  was  a  beautiful  sight. 

“  I  kind  of  liked  the  style  in  Boston, 
it  had  a  nice  history,  and  the  fans  were 
exceptionally  nice  to  me.  I  was  always 
conscientious  and  serious,  and  I  think 
the  fans  sensed  that  I  was  trying  to  do 
my  best,  and  they  appreciated  it.  Play¬ 
ing  my  career  in  Boston  was  one  of  the 
great  breaks  in  my  life,  there  was  never 
anything  adverse  from  the  fans.” 

Bobby,  who  has  to  go  to  town  to 
see  any  traffic  these  days,  has  one  re¬ 
gret  from  his  playing  days.  “The  only 
drawback  was  that  we  never  won  a

at  the  1990  Old  Timers'  Game  at  Fenway.

RED  SOX 

BROADCASTERS 

The  Red  Sox  Radio  Network  will  carry 
every  game,  with  Bob  Starr  and  Joe 
Castiglione  handling  the  play-by-play. 
WRKO-AM  in  Boston  begins  its  third 
season  as  the  flagship  station  of  a  net¬ 
work  of  6 3  stations  which  blankets 
New  England. 

Castiglione  is  in  his  10th  season  on 
Red  Sox  radio.  He  had  previously  covered 


Joe  Castiglione 
and  Bob  Starr 


the  Cleveland  Indians  (1979-80-82)  on 
both  radio  and  TV.  He  also  broadcast  the 
Milwaukee  Brewers  on  cable  in  1981. 

The  Hamden  Conn,  native  has  also 
announced  the  Cleveland  Cavaliers  (NBA) 
on  cable,  and  he  did  college  basketball 
on  New  England  Sports  Network  for  six 
winters.  Joe  has  also  taught  a  broadcast 
journalism  course  at  Northeastern 
University  for  several  years. 

Starr  returned  to  Boston  in  1990  after 
a  20-year  hiatus.  He  had  been  the  sports 
anchor  at  WBZ-TV  (1966-69),  as  well  as 
doing  radio  play-by-play  work  for  Boston 
College  football  and  the  Patriots. 

Prior  to  1990,  he  was  the  television 
voice  of  the  California  Angels  for  nine 
seasons,  and  his  baseball  broadcasting 
resume  includes  the  San  Francisco  Giants 
and  St.  Louis  Cardinals  as  well. 


Ned  Martin 
and  Jerry  Remy 


In  addition,  he  has  broadcast  pro 
football  for  the  Los  Angeles  Rams,  San 
Francisco  49ers,  St.  Louis  Cardinals  and 
Patriots,  and  he  has  called  the  play-by-play 
for  numerous  NFL  championships.  He 
has  also  done  college  football  and  bas¬ 
ketball  for  the  University  of  Missouri, 
Illinois  State,  Bradley  and  Illinois  Wes¬ 
leyan,  and  football  for  UCLA  and  B.C. 

The  Red  Sox  began  radio  broadcasts 
in  Spanish  in  1990.  WROL-AM  in  Boston 
is  the  flagship  of  Carter  Radio  Network’s 
five  stations  (also  Hartford,  Lawrence, 
Providence,  and  Springfield).  Once  again, 
all  weeknight  home  games  will  be  car-

tied.  Hector  Martinez  and  Bobby  Serrano, 
both  natives  of  Puerto  Rico,  will  return 
for  their  third  season  as  the  broadcasters. 

Every  Red  Sox  game  will  also  be 
shown  on  television  this  season,  with  TV- 
38  carrying  75  games  and  New  England 
Sports  Network  (NESN)  showing  81  on 
cable.  CBS  will  have  the  Red  Sox  on 
national  TV  five  times,  while  ESPN  will 


Sean  McDonough 
and  Bob  Montgomery 


show  four  games  on  their  Sunday  night 
national  broadcasts. 

TV-38,  along  with  its  New  England 
network,  is  in  its  18th  season  of  Red 
Sox  coverage,  with  Sean  McDonough 
and  Bob  Montgomery  together  for  their 
fifth  season. 

McDonough,  in  his  fifth  year  as  play- 
by-play  man  for  the  Red  Sox,  is  regarded 
nationally  as  one  of  the  best  in  his  field. 
This  past  February  he  was  in  Albertville, 
France  covering  the  Olympics  for  CBS, 
announcing  the  luge  and  bobsled  events. 
Also  this  past  off-season  again  found  him 
on  ESPN  extensively  doing  both  college 
football  and  basketball.  He  announced 
Hockey  East  games  for  NESN  and  TV-38  for 
six  winters. 

In  addition,  Sean  has  been  a  studio 
host  for  the  Red  Sox  on  NESN,  the  Bruins

Conigliaro  left  in  mid-May  for  two  weeks 
of  army  reserve  duty  at  Camp  Drum, 
New  York.  Before  1967  ballplayers 
could  fulfill  military  duties  in  the  off¬ 
season,  but  increasing  casualties  in  Viet¬ 
nam  and  subsequent  pressure  at  home 
meant  call-ups  now  came  at  any  time. 
In  addition  to  Tony,  Dalton  Jones  and 
Lonborg  were  expected  to  see  duty 
sometime  during  the  summer. 

Boston  survived  Tony’s  absence 
thanks  to  a  variety  of  heroes.  Scott 
became  more  patient  at  the  plate,  steady 
Dalton  Jones  spelled  the  slumping  Foy 
at  third,  and  Yastrzemski’s  hitting  and 
fielding  reached  a  new  level.  In  one 
four-game  series  with  Cleveland,  the 
Sox  came  from  behind  in  each  contest 
—  winning  three  of  four.  The  pitching 
remained  surprisingly  consistent. 

When  Lonborg  and  Co.  finally 
slumped,  it  was  frightening  —  56  runs 
allowed  in  six  games,  including  1 7  home 
runs.  The  worst  came  May  17,  when 
Baltimore  hit  seven  homers  (four  in  the 
seventh)  on  the  way  to  a  1 2-8  win.  The 
crisis  eventually  passed,  and  when 
Lonnie  recorded  a  clutch  1-0  win  in 
Detroit  May  24,  the  Sox  were  back  over 
.500. 

There  was  no  denying  Williams’ 
impact.  By  May’s  end  Boston  had  25 
stolen  bases,  on  pace  to  steal  100  for 
the  first  time  since  1934.  Double  steals 
and  hit-and-run  plays  were  part  of  Dick’s 
game,  as  was  the  suicide  squeeze  — 
already  successful  three  times.  The  team 
earned  run  average  of  3-40  was  its  low¬ 
est  since  the  pennant  year  of  1946. 

June  began  with  a  shutout  loss  to 
Minnesota  and  dreaded  Dean  Chance 
(remember  that  name),  but  things 
quickly  improved.  Lonborg  took  a  no¬ 
hitter  into  the  eighth  at  Cleveland  June 
2,  broken  when .  175-hitting  Duke  Sims 
doubled  with  one  out  into  the  right- 
field  stands.  Jim  (now  7-1)  settled  for  a 
three-hitter  and  2-1  victory.  Immedi¬ 
ately  following  the  game,  the  Sox  an¬ 
nounced  a  trade:  aging  reliever  Don 
McMahon  and  minor  league  righty  Rob 
Snow  to  the  White  Sox  for  infielder 
Jerry  Adair. 

A  scrappy  utilityman  capable  of 
playing  short,  second,  or  third,  Adair, 
30,  was  expected  to  provide  infield 
insurance.  He  proved  much  more,  start¬ 
ing  most  of  the  second  half  and  batting 
a  career-high  .291  for  Boston.  Fifteen 


THE  IMPOSSIBLE  DREAM 
PART  II 


Gary  Bell’s  12  wins  were  a  valuable 
contribution  to  the  cause. 


minutes  after  losing  to  the  Indians  the 
following  night,  the  Sox  made  their 
second  trade  in  as  many  days  getting 
Cleveland  starter  Gary  Bell  in  exchange 
for  Horton  and  veteran  outfielder  Don 
Demeter. 

Williams  called  Bell  immediately  to 
tell  him  he  was  starting  in  Chicago  the 
following  Wednesday,  and  Gary  was 
overjoyed.  Horton,  believing  he  never 
got  his  chance  in  Boston,  took  the  move 
much  harder.  By  trading  a  player  of 
Tony’s  potential  (a  .300  hitter  but  a 
poor  fielder),  Williams  had  shown  his 
toughness  again.  Like  most  of  his  moves, 
it  paid  off. 

A  wily  veteran  and  former  all-star, 
Bell  immediately  gave  the  Sox  a  boost 
with  wins  in  his  first  two  starts.  No 
longer  under  pressure  from  Horton, 
Scott  began  hitting  better  than  ever. 
Yaz  heated  up,  an  11  for  22  streak 
hiking  his  average  to  .322.  His  homer 
and  RBI  totals  also  among  baseball’s 
best,  it  looked  like  Carl  was  finally  hav¬ 
ing  the  year  fans  had  waited  for  from 
the  heir  to  Ted  Williams. 

Despite  such  heroics,  the  Sox  hov¬ 
ered  around  .500  for  several  weeks. 
Then  came  the  turning  point  —  an 
extra-inning  affair  with  the  White  Sox 
June  1 5  at  Fenway.  Chicago  scored  in 
the  1 1  th  to  break  a  0-0  tie,  but  with  two 
outs  in  the  bottom  of  the  inning, 
Conigliaro  hit  a  3-2  pitch  for  a  two-run 
homer  into  the  net.  Tony  ran  out  the 
game-winner  in  his  traditional  head- 
down  manner,  and  when  he  looked  up 
after  rounding  third,  he  could  only  grin. 


Jerry  Adair’s  presence  added  versatility 
and  a  solid  .291  batting  average. 


The  entire  team  was  waiting  for  him  at 
home  plate,  and  the  crowd  (including 
his  father  Sal)  was  screaming  as  if  the 
World  Series  had  just  been  won.  Tony 
leaped  up  and  down  the  rest  of  the  way 
home. 

The  Globe’s  Larry  Birtwell  called  it 
“a  night  to  remember,”  and  like  Rohr’s 
one-hitter,  it  proved  a  pivotal  moment 
for  the  team.  They  were  now  30-28, 
over  .500  to  stay.  If  Rohr’s  effort  had 
given  fans  a  glimpse,  Tony’s  homer 
made  them  believers. 

The  Sox  lost  a  doubleheader  the 
next  night,  but  then  went  7-4  the  re¬ 
mainder  of  the  month.  Against  this  ex¬ 
citing  backdrop,  owner  Tom  Yawkey 
shocked  New  England  by  announcing 
in  late  June  he  would  move  the  Red  Sox 
unless  he  could  find  a  new  stadium  to 
play  in.  He  was  sick  of  losing  money, 
and  a  modem  park  with  more  seating 
and  better  parking  might  help  him  clear 
a  profit.  “This  is  not  a  threat,”  Yawkey 
told  Will  McDonough  of  the  Globe.  “It 
is  merely  a  fact.”  Asked  if  the  Red  Sox 
would  still  be  playing  at  Fenway  in  5 
years,  Yawkey  answered  simply:  “No.” 

Talks  continued  into  July,  political 
and  business  leaders  lending  their  sup¬ 
port.  Possible  stadium  sites  included 
East  Boston  and  Newton,  with  the  most 
serious  bid  a  $26  million,  52,000-seat 
complex  that  could  also  house  the 
homeless  Boston  Patriot  football  club. 
Little  did  Yawkey  know  what  was  about 
to  transpire  at  Fenway.

The  lower  lefthand  corner  of  the  scoring  block  should  be  considered  as  home  plate.  Progress  is 
counter-clockwise  with  progress  to  first  base  indicated  in  lower  righthand  corner,  to  second  in 
upper  righthand  corner,  to  third  in  upper  lefthand  corner  and  to  home  in  lower  left.  In  example 
to  left,  batter  reached  first  on  an  error  by  the  second  baseman,  stole  second,  went  to  third  on  a 
wild  pitch  and  scored  on  a  passed  ball.  It  is  convenient  to  encircle  all  runs  as  shown  so  that

THE  IMPOSSIBLE  DREAM 
PART  II 


Continued  from  page  35 

Folks  around  baseball  were  taking  the  Red  Sox 
seriously.  Oriole  manager  Hank  Bauer  named  Yaz,  Rico, 
and  Tony  C  to  the  starting  lineup  for  the  All-Star  Game, 
and  selected  Lonborg  to  his  pitching  staff.  Jim  celebrated 
with  a  10-2  victory  over  Kansas  City,  but  the  team  then 
suffered  an  excruciating  stretch  of  close  defeats  that 
dropped  them  to  fifth  place  at  the  All-Star  break.  After  a 
4-3  loss  in  Anaheim  July  5  their  record  was  40-36  —  with 
18  of  the  losses  by  one  run.  The  bats  had  fallen  silent,  and 
when  Bell  was  clobbered  by  Baltimore  10-0  a  week  later, 
doubters  speculated  Williams  was  out  of  hunches. 

Once  again,  it  was  Conigliaro  who  lifted  dampened 
spirits.  In  the  first  inning  the  following  night  (July  14), 
Tony  hit  a  homer  so  high  over  the  Green  Monster  veteran 
observers  could  not  recall  a  harder-hit  ball  at  Fenway. 
Yaz  added  his  own  home  run  in  the  sixth  (his  20th,  tying 
a  career  high),  and  Lonborg  got  his  1 2th  win.  Williams 
wasn’t  out  of  luck  —  or  hunches  —  at  all.  Taking  a  tip 
from  catcher  Russ  Gibson  that  July  15  starter  Gary 
Waslewski  “had  nothing,”  Williams  had  Jose  Santiago 
warming  up  even  before  the  game  started.  When 
Waslewski  walked  the  first  two  Orioles  and  went  to  2-0 
on  Paul  Blair,  Dick  made  the  move  to  Jose.  Two  pitches 
later,  Blair  hit  a  liner  to  Foy  at  third  to  start  a  triple  play. 
Santiago  cruised,  and  the  Sox  were  5-1  victors. 

So  it  went.  Fans  began  buying  tickets  for  September 
games,  putting  the  Sox  within  reach  of  a  one  million 
attendance  mark  for  the  first  time  since  I960.  When 
Boston  took  a  pair  from  the  Tigers  (Y az  homering  in  each 
game),  a  writer  asking  Foy  if  he  thought  the  Sox  could 
finish  in  the  first  division  was  told:  “Forget  that.  Why  not 
go  all  the  way?”  A  six-game  trip  to  Baltimore  and  Cleve¬ 
land  began  with  a  two-game  sweep  of  the  Orioles.  Darrell 
Brandon  and  Stange  then  pitched  back-to-back  complete 
game  wins  over  the  Indians.  The  next  day,  July  23,  the 
Sox  swept  a  doubleheader  behind  Lonborg  and  Bell  to 
extend  the  streak  to  10  for  the  first  time  since  May  of 
1951 .  A  homer  by  Conigliaro  in  the  first  game  made  him 
at  22  years  old  the  youngest  major  leaguer  in  history  to

on  TV-38,  and  the  Patriots  on  WHDH 
radio.  The  South  Boston  native  is  a  grad¬ 
uate  of  Syracuse  University.  He  began 
his  broadcasting  career  with  the  Syra¬ 
cuse  Chiefs  of  the  International  League 
(1982-84). 

Montgomery  has  been  with  TV-38 
for  1 1  seasons.  He  was  a  valuable  reserve 
catcher  for  the  Red  Sox  during  his  10-year 
major  league  career.  He  signed  with 
Boston  in  1962  and  came  to  the  majors 
in  1970.  He  played  in  387  games,  includ¬ 
ing  62  for  the  1975  A.L.  pennant  winners, 
before  an  arm  injury  forced  his  retirement 
during  spring  training  in  1980. 

Monty  did  a  local  radio  talk  show  as 
well  as  some  work  on  Red  Sox  radio 
broadcasts,  prior  to  joining  the  TV-38 
team  in  1982.  He  also  announced  the  Red 
Sox  on  NESN  for  three  seasons  (1985-87). 

NESN  is  covering  the  Red  Sox  for 
the  ninth  year,  with  Ned  Martin  and 


Jerry  Remy  teaming  together  for  the 
fifth  season. 

Martin  has  been  announcing  Red  Sox 
games  on  TV  and  radio  for  32  consecu¬ 
tive  seasons,  including  the  past  eight  with 
NESN.  He  began  his  career  in  Charleston, 
West  Virginia,  covering  the  American 
Association  team  there  for  five  years.  He 
joined  Curt  Gowdy  in  the  Red  Sox  booth 
for  the  1961  season  and  has  been  there 
ever  since,  working  with  1 1  different  part¬ 
ners  in  that  time. 

Ned  has  announced  the  A.L.  playofls 
on  CBS  radio  four  times,  and  also  did  the 
1975  World  Series  on  television  for  NBC. 
The  Duke  graduate  is  also  an  accom¬ 
plished  football  announcer,  having  done 
play-by-play  for  the  Patriots  (1965),  Dart¬ 
mouth  (7  years),  Harvard  (6  years),  and 
Yale  (2  years). 

Remy,  a  popular  player  during  his 
career  in  Boston,  is  in  his  fifth  year  in  the 
NESN  booth.  His  playing  days  were  cut 


short  by  a  knee  injury,  which  forced  his 
retirement  during  spring  training  in  1986. 

The  Fall  River,  Mass,  native  broke 
into  the  majors  with  the  Angels  in  1975 
and  was  traded  to  the  Red  Sox  prior  to 
the  1978  season.  He  was  the  club’s  reg¬ 
ular  second  baseman  until  the  early  part 
of  1984,  when  a  serious  knee  injury  effec¬ 
tively  ended  his  career.  He  stole  at  least 
30  bases  in  each  of  his  first  four  major 
league  seasons  and  hit  over  .300  twice 
(1980  &  1981).  In  all,  he  played  in  1,154 
major  league  games  with  a  .275  average. 
He  was  an  All-State  second  baseman  for 
Somerset  High  School  in  1970. 

For  the  convenience  of  its  viewers, 
NESN  rebroadcasts  most  of  its  games  (usu¬ 
ally  that  night  at  1 1:00  and  9:00  a.m.  the 
next  day).  NESN  also  offers  Red  Sox 
Digest,  a  30-minute  pre-game  show,  and 
Red  Sox  Weekly,  a  review  of  all  the  action 
from  the  previous  week.

all-star  teams  and  I  played  in  one  world 
series  (1946)  and  coached  in  another 
(1967).  (He  batted  .409  to  lead  the  Red 
Sox  in  the  series  with  the  Cardinals.) 

Bobby’s  son  works  for  an  account¬ 
ing  firm  but  had  a  brief  fling  as  a  base¬ 
ball  pitcher.”  He  played  for  the  Univer¬ 
sity  of  Oregon  and  one  season  in  the 
Basin  League  in  South  Dakota  with  guys 
like  Jim  Lonborg.  He  had  a  good  curve, 
a  major  league  curve,  but  he  didn’t  have 
enough  of  a  fastball.

a  couple  of  hits  in  the  doubleheader,” 
Doerr  said  with  pride  in  his  voice. 

In  a  way,  Bobby  Doerr  is  happy 
that  he  didn’t  play  in  the  free  agent  era. 
“I  was  always  happy  they  didn’t  want  to 
trade  me.  And  it  would  have  been  hard 
to  go  play  someplace  else  for  a  few 
thousand  dollars. 

“  I  was  very  happy  with  Fenway,  it 
was  a  great  ballpark  to  play  in,  espe¬ 
cially  from  a  hitter’s  standpoint.  The 
weather  was  not  extreme,  and  most 
important  I  always  felt  welcome  there.

Red  Sox  With  The  Fans 


And  In 

T  he  Boston  Red  Sox  announced  their 
sponsoring  of  the  A.  Bartlett  Giamatti 
Little  League  Leadership  Training  Cen¬ 
ter  in  Bristol,  CT,  a  totally  handicapped- 
accessible  facility  for  physically  and 
mentally  disabled  children.  The  Train¬ 
ing  Center  which  will  be  the  interna¬ 
tional  headquarters  of  the  Little  League’s 
Challenger  Division,  will  feature  train¬ 
ing  and  education  programs  as  well  as 
tournament  play  for  over  500,000  boys 
and  girls  giving  them  an  opportunity  to 
participate  in  Little  League  baseball  for 
the  first  time.  The  Red  Sox  are  the  first 
to  support  this  endeavor. 


The  Community 


Some  of  the  attendees  at  the  April  14  press  conference  held  at  Fenway  Park  to 
announce  Red  Sox  sponsorship  of  the  Center  were  from  left  to  right:  Dr.  Creighton  J. 
Hale,  president  and  CEO  of  Little  League  Baseball;  Tim  Naehring  and  Mike  Greenwell 
with  two  youngsters  from  the  program,  Terry  Rubman  and  Joey  Elecwicz.  Photo

Phil  Plantier  delighted  many  of  the  patients  at  the  Veterans  Administration  Medical  Center  in  San  Diego  when  he  visited  and 
signed  autographs  on  National  Salute  to  Hospitalized  Veterans  Day  last  February  14. 


Scott  Cooper  posed  with  99-year-old 
Red  Sox  fan  Louis  Rosenthal  who  threw 
out  the  first  pitch  before  a  recent  game. 


On  April  24,  before  the  Red  Sox/T exas  game  at  Fenway,  Red  Sox  players  and 
coaches  conducted  the  Red  Sox/Boston  Globe  Clinic  for  3,500  youngsters  and 
parents.  Here,  Tim  Naehring  explains  the  fundamentals  of  fielding  to  the  crowd. 
This  off-field  event  was  sponsored  by  the  Boston  Globe  who  advertised  the  clinic 
and  purchased  tickets  to  the  game  that  were  given  to  the  winners  and  their  guests.

THE  IMPOSSIBLE  DREAM 
PART  II 


Continued  from  page  46 


The  Red  Sox  were  unaccustomed  to  scenes  such  as  this. 


reach  100  home  runs.  His  youthful  suc¬ 
cess  seemed  to  mirror  that  of  his  team. 

On  the  plane  ride  home  from  Cleve¬ 
land,  it  was  announced  something  “out 
of  the  ordinary”  was  happening  at 
Boston’s  Logan  Airport.  Players  didn’t 
know  what  to  expect,  and  when  they 
landed  that  night  to  a  reception  of 
1 5,000  people,  they  couldn’t  believe  it. 

“Actually,  it  was  kind  of  scary,” 
Stange  recalled  this  spring.  “They 
couldn’t  get  the  plane  into  the  airport, 
so  they  took  us  to  the  end  of  the  run¬ 
way,  figuring  we  would  be  safe  out 
there.  They  brought  out  the  bus,  and  as 
we  got  off  the  plane  and  onto  it,  all 
those  15,000  fans  got  around  the  bus. 
For  a  minute  there  I  thought  they  were 
going  to  tip  it  over.  ” 

Fans  waited  for  hours  on  Jersey 
Street  (now  Yawkey  Way)  for  tickets  to 
an  eight-game  homestand,  and  the  Sox 
responded  by  taking  5  of  8  from  con¬ 
tenders  California  and  Minnesota. 
Against  the  Angels  July  27,  the  biggest 
Fenway  crowd  since  1 958  (34, 1 93)  saw 
Boston  erase  a  5-2  deficit  in  the  ninth  on 
a  solo  homer  by  Conigliaro  -  after  Foy 
smashed  a  two-run  blast  one  out  ahead 
of  him.  They  won  in  the  10th  on  a 
ground-ball  error  after  Yaz  made  two 
great  plays  in  left  field  in  the  top  of  the 
inning.  Trailing  3-2  two  days  later,  Wil¬ 
liams  got  pinch  hits  in  the  eighth  from 
Norm  Siebem  (just  picked  up  from  San 
Francisco)  and  Jones  to  seal  another 
victory  before  35,469,  the  largest  crowd 


in  1 1  years.  The  Sox  were  finding  every 
way  imaginable  to  win,  and  talk  of  a 
new  stadium  was  quickly  forgotten. 
Fenway  Park  was  the  place  to  be. 

Entering  August  the  Sox  were  still 
in  second  place,  56-44,  two  games  be¬ 
hind  Chicago.  It  was  going  to  be  a  battle 
to  the  wire:  Detroit,  Minnesota,  and 
California  were  also  within  five  games 
of  the  top.  Private  first  class  Lonborg 
(serving  his  two-week  reserve  stint) 
flew  in  from  Atlanta  to  pick  up  his  1 5th 
win  August  1 ,  and  even  seven  losses  on 
a  nine-game  road  trip  couldn’t  derail 
Boston’s  hopes.  Contenders  beat  up  on 
one  another  to  keep  the  Sox  from  los¬ 
ing  ground,  and  when  Lonborg  used 


another  overnight  pass  to  fly  to  Kansas 
City  and  pick  up  a  5-1  victory,  Boston 
crept  back  to  within  1-1/2  of  the  top 
August  9. 

Veteran  catcher  Elston  Howard 
(villain  in  the  Rohr  game)  was  bought 
from  the  Yankees,  and  immediately 
made  an  impact  with  his  deft  handling 
of  the  pitching  staff.  Williams  was  up  to 
his  old  tricks,  benching  Scott  against 
California  for  being  two  pounds  over¬ 
weight,  even  though  the  Boomer  was 
hitting  .343  with  four  homers  against 
the  Angels.  Back  home,  New  England¬ 
ers  sat  by  their  bedside  radios  listening 
in  agony  as  two  more  one-run  losses

THE  IMPOSSIBLE  DREAM 


slipped  by  with  Scott  on  the  pine. 

Players  and  fans  may  have  hated 
him  at  times,  but  it  was  hard  not  to 
respect  Williams.  By  the  time  the  Sox 
entered  a  mid-August  series  with  the 
Angels  at  Fenway,  they  were  still  just  3- 
1/2  games  from  the  top.  In  the  midst  of 
an  1 1-game  homestand,  Boston  hoped 
to  make  up  ground  on  the  White  Sox, 
Tigers,  and  Twins.  The  bats  were  com¬ 
ing  around,  starters  Stange  and  Santiago 
were  on  fire,  and  a  kid  named  Albert 
“Sparky”  Lyle  had  joined  Wyatt  in  the 
bullpen  with  great  success.  The  night 
before,  the  coveted  one  million  atten¬ 
dance  mark  had  been  reached. 

Thousands  of  miles  away,  numbers 
of  a  different  kind  were  rising  far  too 
fast  in  Southeast  Asia,  and  General  Wil¬ 
liam  C.  Westmoreland  requested  Presi¬ 
dent  Lyndon  Johnson  have  600,000 
troops  in  Vietnam  by  year’s  end.  Racial 
riots  in  Newark  left  dozens  dead, 
prompting  Johnson  to  form  a  commit¬ 
tee  to  investigate  urban  violence.  Mas¬ 
sachusetts  Senator  Edward  Brooke,  the 


John  Wyatt’s  efforts  totaled  1 0  wins  and 
20  saves. 


lone  black  in  the  senate,  was  named  a 
member. 

The  world  was  changing,  but  the 
Red  Sox  were  still  in  a  pennant  race. 
The  same  Fenway  Park  that  two  months 


earlier  was  the  subject  of  demolition 
debate  had  become  electrified  with 
pennant  fever. 

On  August  18,  1967,  Conigliaro 
stepped  up  to  the  plate  in  the  bottom 
of  the  fourth  inning  to  face  the  Angels’ 
Jack  Hamilton.  What  happened  next 
broke  the  calm  warmth  of  the  evening 
—  and  forever  changed  the  course  of  a 
baseball  season  and  a  young  man’s  life. 
Hamilton  threw  a  fastball.  It  moved  in 
toward  Conigliaro's  head,  and  the  home¬ 
town  hero  froze. 

Tony  C  was  down. 


A  freelance  writer from  Brookline,  Saul  Wisnia 
was  bom  a  Tony  C  homer  from  Fenway  the 
week  the  Sox  broke  camp  to  begin  the  Impos¬ 
sible  Dream.  He  is  currently  writing  a  book  on 
the  Red  Sox  and  Boston  Braves  as  they  co¬ 
existed  in  Boston  during  the  20  seasons  from 
when  Tom  Yawkey  bought  the  Red  Sox  in  1933 
to  when  the  Braves  left  town  following  the  1952 
season.  Entitled  From  Yawkey  to  Milwaukee, 
the  book  is  being  edited  by  Dick  Johnson,  cura¬ 
tor  at  the  Sports  Museum  and  co-author  of  Ted 
Williams -A  Portrait  in  Words  and  Pictures.

A  GREAT  IDEA  FOR 
RED  SOX  FANS 


Robin  Samora 
is  a  woman 
who  knows 
how  it  feels 
to  pitch  to  the 
Red  Sox. 

Last  year, 
she  stood  in  the 
team’s  front 
offices  present¬ 
ing  a  unique 
idea  -  a  personalized,  full-color  story¬ 
book  about  a  day  at  Fenway  Park.  This 
year,  the  subject  of  her  pitch,  My  Day 
At  Fenway  Park,  shows  every  sign  of 
becoming  a  hit. 

Samora  began  warming  up  in  1990, 
when  the  idea  for  the  book  popped 
into  her  head  at  a  Red  Sox  game.  With 
over  two  years  experience  producing 
personalized  children’s  books,  she  was 
certain  that  their  customized  format 
would  be  ideal  for  a  tale  about  one  of 
the  country’s  most  historical  ballparks. 

“From  the  start,  we  knew  that 
My  Day  At  Fenway  Park  had  to  be 
more  than  just  a  typical  personalized 
storybook,”  said  Samora.  “We  added 
special  customization  categories  like 
‘Favorite  Baseball  Player’  and  ‘Favorite 
Food.’  And  we  created  a  page  that 
would  specifically  highlight  the  game’s 
starting  lineup  and  final  score.” 


Samora  assembled  a  team,  called 
Ballpark  Publications,  that  soon  discov¬ 
ered  there  was  much  work  to  be  done. 
Every  aspect  of  the  book,  from  the 
production  of  its  gold-stamped,  red 
velour  cover  to  the  creation  of  the 
marketing  plan  had  to  be  reviewed, 
analyzed,  and  agreed  upon. 

“Even  at  our  very  first  meeting,  we 
were  faced  with  a  major  challenge  - 
the  story  itself,”  Samora  continued. 

“We  wanted  the  story  to  include 
real  aspects  of  a  visit  to  the  park,  like 
stopping  at  the  concession  stand,  but 
we  also  wanted  a  little  of  the  history  of 
Fenway.  Plus  we  wanted  some  of  the 
basic  rules  of  baseball.  Of  course,  it  also 
had  to  be  structured  to  allow  personal¬ 
ization  throughout.  And  all  of  these 
elements  had  to  somehow  be  com¬ 
bined  in  a  book  that  would  be  not  just 
educational,  but  interesting  and 
enjoyable  as  well.” 

“The  book  offered  us  an  excellent 
opportunity  to  not  only  promote  the 
team  and  the  sport,”  explained  Dick 
Bresciani,  Red  Sox  Vice  President  of 
Public  Relations,  “but  also  to  build 
loyalty  among  a  growing  number  of 
young  fans.  And  to  do  so  with  a  story 
that  is  fun  and  informative.” 

Today,  order  forms  for  My  Day 
At  Fenway  Park  are  available  within 
Fenway  Park,  as  well  as  through  local 
ticket  and  souvenir  shops  and  Ballpark’s 
800  Number.  And  the  response  from 


fans  to  date  has  been  loud,  strong  and 
widespread. 

“Although  most  of  our  orders 
are  from  New  England,  we’ve  had  a 
surprising  number  of  responses  from 
places  like  New  York,  Florida,  Cali¬ 
fornia,  Texas  and  elsewhere,”  said 
Chuck  Conte,  Ballpark’s  Vice  President 
of  Marketing.  “I  guess  it  only  goes  to 
prove  that  the  Red  Sox  have  fans  all 
over  the  country.  Actually,  fans  all  over 
the  world.  In  fact,  we  just  sent  an  order 
off  to  France.” 

And  the  people  placing  the  orders 
are  as  diversified  as  their  mailing 
addresses.  According  to  Samora: 

“We  thought  we  were  creating  a 
children’s  book,  but  we  discovered  that 
people  of  all  ages  were  responding.  We 
had  a  husband  who  gave  it  to  his  wife 
for  their  40th  wedding  anniversary 
commemorating  a  game  they  attended 
on  their  honeymoon.  We  had  a  second 
grader  who  brought  the  book  to  show- 
and-tell,  which  prompted  his  teacher  to 
order  it.  We  had  a  father  who  ordered  a 
book  for  a  baby  that  was  only  a  day  or 
two  old.  And  we  had  several  people 
who  ordered  books  for  September 
28th,  I960  because  they  were  at  the 
game  where  Ted  Williams  hit  his  final 
home  run.  The  diversity  of  the  orders 
has  been  incredible.”

146,670  hits.  And  counting. 


This  year,  the  2,106  baseball  games  played  in 
the  major  leagues  will  yield  tens  of  thousands  of 
hits,  walks,  strikeouts,  stolen  bases,  double  plays 
and  runs. 

They  will  produce  a  staggering  mountain  of 
statistics  that’ll  be  chewed  up  and  pored  over  by 
sportswriters,  fans  and  teams  alike.  Over  and  over 
again,  statistics  will  fuel  not  only  official  records 
and  standings,  but  also  good-natured  arguments 
and  the  booming  hobby  of  fantasy  leagues. 

Data  covering  everything  from  batting  aver¬ 
ages,  stolen  bases,  and  won-lost  percentages  to 
more  obscure  considerations  like  whether  a  team 
plays  better  on  grass  or  artificial  turf,  or  at  night 
instead  of  daytime. 

Ever  since  the  first  ball  was  thrown,  measure¬ 
ments  have  been  made  on  just  about  every  aspect 
of  the  game,  not  just  to  establish  current  team 
and  player  rankings  and  correlate  past  perfor¬ 
mance  with  future  success,  but  to  enrich  the  lore 
and  preserve  the  legends  of  our  national  pastime. 

Needless  to  say,  accuracy  and  speed  in  jug¬ 
gling  these  figures  are  paramount.  What  better 
endeavor  to  utilize  the  power  of  the  computer? 

So,  five  years  ago,  Major  League  Baseball  and 
IBM  embarked  on  a  joint  effort  to  create  what  is 
now  known  as  the  MLB-IBM  Baseball  Informa¬ 
tion  System  (BIS). 

Now,  from  the  very  first  pitch  of  opening  day 
to  the  last  play  of  the  World  Series,  the  results  of 
every  player  who  steps  to  the  plate  are  recorded  and 
analyzed  faster  than  a  Nolan  Ryan  fastball.  (In 
fact,  as  of  last  season,  we’ve  logged  146,670  hits.) 

Whether  he  struck  out  or  singled.  Whether 
there’s  a  walk  or  a  ground-rule  double.  Bases 
stolen  or  runs  batted  in.  It’s  all  entered  by  a 
representative  from  the  home  team  working 
on  an  IBM  Personal  System/2®  computer  in  the 
press  box. 

After  the  game,  a  complete  report  is  printed 
out  containing  long  and  short  box  scores  and 
complete  year-to-date  statistics  as  well  as  a  play- 
by-play  narrative  of  the  game  (by  the  time  the 
reporters  return  from  postgame  interviews  and 
in  plenty  of  time  to  meet  newspaper  deadlines). 
Reporters  have  hailed  the  BIS  an  absolute  gift. 


It  saves  them  endless  calculations.  And,  with  the 
accompanying  narrative  report  of  each  game,  it 
helps  jog  the  memory  in  case  anything  was  left 
out  of  their  notes. 

The  postgame  information  is  then  sent  elec¬ 
tronically  to  a  central  host  computer  at  MLB 
headquarters  in  New  York.  There,  the  larger  com¬ 
puter,  an  IBM  AS/400®  compiles  the  statistics, 
along  with  the  data  and  statistics  of  every  other 
game  played  that  day. 

Until  the  MLB-IBM  System,  many  types  of 
statistical  reports  were  only  available  once  a  week 
or  monthly,  or  not  at  all.  Now,  by  9  o’clock  the  next 
morning,  the  host  computer  makes  available 
reports  covering  more  than  29  categories  (and 
growing)  for  all  26  clubs. 

In  addition  to  reports  for  all  teams,  individual 
team  intelligence  reports  provide  detailed  perfor¬ 
mance  data  in  many  areas  such  as  how  pitchers  per¬ 
form  in  late  innings  or  a  hitter’s  ability  to  advance 
runners  in  certain  situations  or  his  batting  effec¬ 
tiveness  against  righties  or  lefties.  Today,  this 
information  is  a  vital  element  of  managerial  strat¬ 
egy,  coaching  help  and  even  front  office  moves. 

In  total,  the  massive  effort  produces  over  300 
daily  reports  during  the  season  and  an  addition¬ 
al  360  postseason  reports  covering  48  more 
categories. 

It  also  provides  online  data  for  the  press  at 
the  World  Series  and  All  Star  games,  and  because 
it’s  instantaneous,  BIS  ensures  reporters  get  up- 
to-date  stats  in  the  event  of  last-minute  changes. 

Finally,  the  system  provides  accurate  statistics 
for  MLB  publications  like  the  official  League  Red 
and  Green  books. 

In  a  very  short  time,  the  MLB-IBM  system  has 
had  a  very  profound  effect  on  how  our  nation’s 
favorite  game  is  played  and  enjoyed. 

And,  while  the  importance  of  many  contri¬ 
butions  made  to  baseball  over  the  years  can  never 
accurately  be  measured,  happily,  now  there  is 
something  that  can.

support  for  the  Jimmy  Fund  under  the  ownership 
of  Thomas  A.  Yawkey,  cancer  was  predictably  fatal.

astounding  breakthroughs  in  cancer  research  and

JOE  HESKETH 


Continued  from  page  16 


“I  got  the  call  from  Boston,  they 
were  in  a  pennant  race  and  needed  a 
left-handed  setup  man. 

“I  said  ‘what  the  heck,  I’ve  got  two 
months  left  in  the  season,  I  might  as 
well  play  it  out,  see  what  happens.’ 

“I  thought  playing  in  Fenway  Park 
and  pitching  for  the  Red  Sox  would  be 
fun.  I  didn’t  pitch  badly  (0-4,  3  51  ERA 
in  12  appearances,  two  of  them  starts), 
but  when  the  playoffs  came  around,  I 
knew  I  wasn’t  going  to  be  on  the  roster. 
It  was  a  numbers  thing  and  understand¬ 
able.” 

The  Red  Sox  brought  Hesketh  to 
camp  the  next  spring,  but  he  didn’t 
really  figure  in  Manager  Joe  Morgan’s 
plans. 

Hesketh  suspected  this  and  decided 
if  he  was  going  down,  he  was  going 
down  firing  both  barrels. 

“I  had  to  reach  down  again  and  see 
what  I  had  left  in  me  as  far  as  being  a 
competitor,”  he  said. 

“I  didn’t  want  to  leave  the  game 
thinking  I  was  giving  up  on  myself.  So 
I  said:  ‘what  the  heck,  I’ll  give  it  one 
more  shot  in  the  spring,  and  we  ll  see 
what  happens  from  there.’ 

“And  knock  on  wood  everything’s 
been  pretty  good  since.” 

Pretty  good  may  be  an  understate¬ 
ment. 

Hesketh  pitched  his  way  onto  the 
team  last  spring  and  wound  up  having 
a  season  that  exceeded  even  his  wildest 
dreams. 

He  made  23  appearances  during 
the  first  half  of  the  season,  22  out  of  the 
bullpen. 

Then,  because  of  a  succession  of 
injuries,  he  got  a  chance  to  start,  and 
once  he  got  his  foot  in  the  door,  they 
couldn’t  get  him  out. 

He  made  16  starts,  won  10,  only 
lost  three  and  had  an  earned  run  aver¬ 
age  of  3  00.  Overall  he  finished  the 
season  by  winning  a  career-high  12 


games  and  lost  only  four.  His  overall 
ERA  was  3-29,  and  he  led  the  major 
leagues  with  a  .750  winning  percent¬ 
age. 

The  frosting  on  the  cake  came  when 
he  signed  a  two-year  deal  (the  club  has 
the  option  for  the  third)  worth  an  esti¬ 
mated  $3  5  million.  From  a  $465,000 
salary  in  1 99 1 ,  he  jumped  to  $  1 , 77 5 ,000 
this  season. 

Hesketh  had  severe  shoulder  sur¬ 
gery  for  an  impinged  nerve  in  his  shoul¬ 
der  -  an  injury  that  sidelined  him  from 
July  3,  1986  until  August  13,  1987. 

When  he  came  back  he  was  a  full¬ 
time  reliever  and  pitched  well  in  18 
appearances  for  the  Expos. 

He  made  a  career-high  60  appear¬ 
ances  out  of  the  bullpen  going  4-3  with 
nine  saves.  But  disaster  struck  the  fol¬ 
lowing  season. 


“They  were  looking  for  good  things 
from  me,  but  things  went  totally  the 
other  way.  It  didn’t  work  well,  and  it 
got  to  be  an  ugly  situation. 

“It  was  getting  to  the  point  where 
I  wasn’t  enjoying  going  to  the  ballpark.  ” 
He  thought  he  got  a  break  when 
the  Expos  released  him  and  the  Braves 
picked  him  up. 

“I  felt  if  I  got  a  chance  to  pitch, 
things  might  turn  around  for  me.  They 
gave  me  some  opportunities  as  a  closer, 
but  as  you  well  know,  I’ m  not  a  closer.  ” 
Hesketh  believes  his  arm  came  back 
to  where  it  was  before  the  surgery 
because  he  became  a  starter. 

“Dr.  (Frank)  Jobe  who  did  the  op¬ 
eration  on  me  said  the  best  thing  for  my 
arm  would  probably  to  be  a  starting

pitcher.  That  gives  me  four  days  in 
between  to  work  on  the  muscles  of  my 
shoulder  and  back  and  pitch  once  ev¬ 
ery  five  days. 

“The  day  after  I  pitch  my  shoulder 
gets  tired.  I  take  the  day  off,  then  hit  the 
weight  room  the  next  two  days,  then 
take  another  day  off.  So  far  it  hasn't 
bothered  me. 

“Starting  pitching  is  my  niche.  I 
don’t  know  if  being  in  the  bullpen  was 
good  for  the  type  of  surgery  I  had, 
getting  ready  in  a  couple  of  minutes. 

“I  think  for  me  it  was  a  matter  of 
opportunity,  and  unfortunately  for  the 
team,  we  had  a  series  of  injuries  and 
that  put  me  into  the  starting  rotation.” 

As  a  starter  Hesketh  strives  for  con¬ 
sistency. 

“I  want  to  keep  the  team  in  the 
game.  I  want  to  be  a  consistent  pitcher, 
not  a  guy  who  goes  out,  has  one  good 
start  then  maybe  two  or  three  shaky 
ones,  then  a  bad  one,  then  a  good  one. 
I  just  want  to  be  consistent.” 

The  record  shows  he  had  been 
very  consistent  as  well  as  very  good.

The  only  razor  that  senses  and  adjusts 
to  the  individual  needs  of  your  face. 


Gillette  Sensor:  the  shave  personalized  to  every  man. 

It  starts  with  twin  blades,  individually  and 
independently  mounted  on 
highly  responsive  springs. 

So  they  continuously  sense  and  automatically 
adjust  to  the  individual  curves  and  unique  needs 
of  your  face. 

Innovation  is  everywhere.  You 
can  feel  it  in  the  textured  ridges 
and  the  balance  of  the  Sensor 
razor.  You  appreciate  it  in  the  easy 
loading  system  and  the  convenient 

shaving  organizer. 

Even  rinsing  is  innova¬ 
tive.  The  new  blades  are  50% 
narrower  than  any  others 
allowing  water  to  flow  freely  around  and  through  them, 
for  effortless  cleaning  and  rinsing.
