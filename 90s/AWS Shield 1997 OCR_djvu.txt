Time Well Spent 1 



\^/ hy is our time well spent at Annie Wright? Time is well 
spent here because of the environment which we all create : a civil 
and inclusive environment that welcomes everyone into the 
school community, enabling growth and change to occur. 

Time is well spent at Annie Wright because the process of 
growing up for our ^ 
students involves all 
portions of the 
school community. 

Many of us 
think that our time 
has been well spent 




BELOW: A time for joy... Middle schooler Hillary Bruce jokes around with friends 
Brett Meager and Casey Leo. 

Annie Wright School 




ABOVE: A time to laugh... Upper schoolers Hiori Eijima. Kelly 
Blume, and Shelby Nutter 



because we see students 
leaving the Annie Wright 
School who know that they 
have done something 
significant with their lives 
while here. 

Annie Wright is but a 
phase in our lives. We hope this phase helps to train our 
students to manage the change which the future phases of their 
lives will surely bring. But that is the future. We hope that what 

is in the past, the 
time spent at 
Annie Wright, 
has been time 
well spent. 

-Robert Klarsch, 
Headmaster 




ABOVE: A time for peace... Lower schoolers Andrew 
Nakayama, Mack Konigsfeld. Alex Ristubenm. Daniel

Dear Seniors, 

You've been wonderful role models to the freshman and we wish 
you good luck In the future. Your leaving is bittersweet. It's bitter 
because you're leaving. It's sweet because we'll no longer be freshman. 
Don't let being college freshman get you down. By the time we're 
freshman in college you'll be seniors again! Now that you bananas are 
splitting, us 'berries will be blue, but our thoughts are always with you 
and we hope you miss us too.

The body repeats the landscape. They

never before experienced on this greening 
planet.

And a women who held a babe against 
her bosom said, Speak to us of Children. 
And he said: 

Your children are not your children. 
They are the sons and daughters of Life's 
longing for itself. 

They come through you but not from you, 
And though they are with you they belong 
not to you. 

You may give them your love but not your 
thoughts, 

For they have their own thoughts. 

You may house their bodies but not their souls, 

For their souls dwell in the house of 
tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even In 
your dreams. 

You may strive to be like them, but seek not 
to make them like you. q 

For life goes not backward nor tarries ^^^^

Baby boo girls all seven plus eights 
Sing for the aged, the worried, the 
weary. 

Remind us to smile with the wisdoms 
of youth 
And to laugh at the foibles of 
parents. 

Give us the songs of astronauts. 
Sing of building, of medicine, of law. 
Sing like Elizabeth, Isabel and 
Columbo. 
Sing of Asia and finding the Saolo.
