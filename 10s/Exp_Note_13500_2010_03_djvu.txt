EXPLANATORY NOTES 


INTRODUCTION 


1 Explanatory Notes in the form found in other ABS publications are not included in Australian 
Economic Indicators. Readers are directed to the Explanatory Notes contained in related ABS 
publications. 


2 Australian Economic Indicators presents a statistical summary of the Australian economy, 
together with international comparisons of selected economic indicators. It also includes 
commentaries, articles and technical notes. Australian Economic Indicators has been 
developed primarily as a reference document, providing a broad basis for economic analysis and 
research. 


3 The tables contain mainly ABS data, although data from other sources are included. For ABS 
sourced data, the publication name and catalogue number are included in the footnotes of the 
tables. If the data are from other sources, the source organisation’s name is included in the 
footnotes. 


MOST RECENT DATA 


4 The statistics shown are the latest available as at 24 February 2010. 


RELATED PUBLICATIONS 


5 A list of related publications is included on the ABS website under the Related Information tab 
of the latest release of Australian Economic Indicators. These include publications which are 
the source of the data in the tables and other related publications. 


6 Other useful sources of detailed information are the ‘Concepts, Sources and Methods’ and 
classification publications. These are released irregularly, each relating to a specific publication, 
collection or standard classification. The publications most relevant to Australian Economic 
Indicators include:

SEASONALLY ADJUSTED AND TREND ESTIMATES 


7 Series in this publication include original, seasonally adjusted and trend series. Special care 
should always be taken in interpreting data for the most recent months and quarters. Some of the 
original and all of the seasonally adjusted and trend series are subject to revision. 


8 It is not uncommon for movements in original time series data and those provided from 
seasonally adjusted and trend series to differ significantly. Movements in a time series of original 
data may reflect several factors, including: 


= longer-term changes in the item being measured (i.e. trend movements) 
» short-term irregular changes 

= regular seasonal influences 

= normal ‘trading’, ‘working’ or ‘pay’ day patterns 

= systematic holiday effects. 


9 Seasonal adjustment and trend estimates help the user to identify the effect of these influences 
on the time series. Seasonal adjustment removes the effect of the last three listed influences 
from the data, leaving only the trend and short-term irregular movements. Trend estimates are 
then obtained by removing the effects of the short-term irregularities, which in many series can 
be a major contributor to movements in the original data. By comparing the historical trend series 
with the seasonally adjusted series, the user can identify the short-term irregularities which have 
influenced the original series. 


10 Trend estimates produced by the ABS are based on Henderson Moving Averages, and are 
therefore subject to revision especially for the latest few months or quarters. 


11 The general methods used in the ABS for making seasonal adjustments are described in 
Information paper: An Introductory Course on Time Series Analysis - Electronic Delivery ( 
cat. no. 1346.0.55.001). The method used to estimate trends is described in Information Paper: A 
Guide to Interpreting Time Series - Monitoring Trends ( cat. no. 1349.0). 


12 The ABS uses concurrent seasonal adjustment to derive the combined adjustment factors. 
This means that data from the current month are used in estimating seasonal and trading day 
factors for the current and previous months. Concurrent adjustment can result in revisions each 
month to estimates for earlier periods. However, in most instances, the only noticeable revisions 
will be to the combined adjustment factors for the current month, the previous month and the 
same month a year ago. As a result of the concurrent seasonal adjustment the trend estimates 
are also concurrently estimated. Further information on concurrent seasonal adjustment can be 
found in Information Paper: Introduction of Concurrent Seasonal Adjustment into the Retail 
Trade Series, 1999 ( cat. no. 8514.0). 


CHAIN VOLUME MEASURES 


13 The chain volume measures appearing in this publication are annually-reweighted chain 
Laspeyres indexes referenced to the current price values in a chosen reference year (i.e. the 
year when the quarterly chain volume measures sum to the current price annual values). Chain 
Laspeyres volume measures are compiled by linking together (Compounding) movements in 


volumes, calculated using the average prices of the previous financial year, and applying the 
compounded movements to the current price estimates of the reference year. Quarterly chain 
volume estimates are benchmarked to annual chain volume estimates, so that the quarterly 
estimates for a financial year sum to the corresponding annual estimate. 


14 Chain volume measures are not generally additive. In other words, in general, component 
chain volume measures do not sum to a total in the way original current price components do. In 
order to minimise the impact of this property, the ABS uses the latest base year as the reference 
year (i.e. the year prior to the latest complete financial year). By adopting this approach, non- 
additivity does not exist for the quarters following the reference year (currently 2007-08) and is 
relatively small for the quarters in the reference year and the quarters immediately preceding it. A 
new base year and the reference year for volume measures are updated annually in the 
September quarter Australian National Accounts (Australian Economic Indicators, January 
issue). In the September quarter 2009 Australian National Accounts issue, the new reference 
year became 2007-08 for volume estimates. This had two effects, first, a new base year, 
2007-08, was introduced which has resulted in revisions to growth rates in subsequent periods. 
Second, the volume estimates have been re-referenced to 2007-08 thus preserving additivity in 
the quarters after the reference year. Re-referencing changes levels but not growth rates, 
although some revision to recent growth rates can be expected because of the introduction of a 
more recent base year (and revisions to the current price estimates underlying the chain volume 
measures). 


OTHER USAGES 


15 Columns in bold in the tables indicate a total. Columns usually sum from the left, with the total 
appearing on the right. A major exception is the balance of payments and international 
investment position data in Chapter 2. These data sum from the right with the total appearing on 
the left - in keeping with the international standard for these statistics. Some tables include 
subtotal columns and columns which need to be subtracted to obtain the total. Where this is not 
clear a footnote explains the relationship between the columns. 


16 Columns in italics indicate that seasonally adjusted or trend estimates are not available for 
that column, and original data are provided instead. 


17 Yearly periods shown as, e.g. 2007-08, refer to the fiscal year ended 30 June 2008. 


18 Where figures have been rounded, discrepancies may occur between sums of the component 
items and totals. Percentage changes may not be exactly comparable to tabulated source series 
due to rounding of the source series, the percentage change series or both.
