a  tenn  of  thirty-six  (36)  months  from  this  date  (called  "Primary  team"),  and  as  long  thereafter 
as  oil,  gas,  liquid  hydrocarbons  or  their  respective  constituent  components,  or  any  of  them,  is 
produced  in  paying  quantities  from  said  physical  land  or  land  with  which  said  land  or  any  part 
thereof  is  pooled,  or  this  lease  is  maintained  by  virtue  of  some  other  provision  hereof. 

3.  This  lease  does  not  include  and  there  is  hereby  excepted  and  reserved  to  Lessor 
all  of  the  sulphur,  coal,  lignite,  uranium  and  other  fissionable  materials,  geothermal 
energy  (including  entrained  methane,  hydrostatic  pressure  and  thermal  energy),  rock, 
gravel,  and  sand,  base  and  precious  metals  and  any  other  mineral  substances  (excepting 
oil,  liquid  hydrocarbons,  gas  and  their  respective  constituent  products  expressly  covered 


under  this  lease)  presently  owned  by  Lessor  in,  under  or  upon  the  leased  premises, 
together  with  rights  of  ingress  and  egress  and  use  of  the  leased  premises  by  Lessor  and  its 
mineral  Lessees,  for  purposes  of  seismic  exploration  for  the  minerals  reserved  herein  to 
Lessor. 


4.        The  royalties  to  be  paid  by  Lessee  are: 


(a)  on  oil  and  on  other  liquid  hydrocarbons  saved  at  the  well,  25%  of  that  produced  and 
saved  from  said  land,  same  to  be  delivered  at  the  wells  or  to  the  credit  of  Lessor  in  tire 
pipeline  to  which  the  wells  may  be  connected  with  Lessor's  interest  in  either  case  to  be 
free  and  clear  of  all  costs  and/or  expenses  of  any  kind  including  but  not  limited  to 
production,  pre-production,  post-production,  severance,  compression,  treating, 
gathering,  transportation,  and  other  excise  taxes  and/or  other  cost  incurred  by  Lessee  in 
transporting,  delivering,  processing,  compressing,  or  otherwise  making  such  oil  and/or 
other  liquid  hydrocarbons  merchantable.  .  However,  any  such  transportation  costs 
which  result  in  enhancing  the  value  of  the  of  the  marketable  oil,  gas  or  other 
products  to  receive  a  better  price  may  be  deducted  from  Lessor's  share  of  production 
as  long  as  they  are  based  on  Lessee's  actual  transportation  cost  of  such 
enhancements.  In  no  event  shall  Lessor  receive  a  price  that  is  less  than,  or  more  than, 
the  price  received  by  Lessee  from  an  unaffiliated  third  party  purchaser.  However, 
Lessee  may  at  its  option,  at  any  tune  or  from  time  to  time,  purchase  Lessor's  oil  at  the 
well,  paying  therefore  the  total  value  of  all  benefits  and/or  consideration  received  by 
Lessee,  or  any  related,  affiliated,  and/or  associated  entity  from  the  sale  and/or  other 
dispositions  of  the  hydrocarbons; 

(b)  on  gas,  including  casing  head  gas  and  all  gaseous  substances,  produced  from  said  land 
and  sold  or  used  by  Lessee,  25%  of  the  total  value  of  all  benefits  and/or  consideration 
received  by  Lessee,  or  any  related,  affiliated,  and/or  associated  entity  from  the  sale 
and/or  other  dispositions  of  such  gas  and/or  gaseous  substances.  Such  25%  shall  not  bear 
any  costs  and/or  expenses  of  any  kind  including  but  not  limited  to  production,  pre- 
production,  post-production,  severance,  compression,  treating,  gathering,  transportation, 
and  other  excise  taxes  and/or  other  cost  incurred  by  Lessee  in  transporting,  delivering, 
processing,  compressing,  or  otherwise  making  such  gas  and/or  gaseous  substance 
merchantable  .  However,  any  such  transportation  costs  which  result  in  enhancing  the 
value  of  the  of  the  marketable  oil,  gas  or  other  products  to  receive  a  better  price  may 
be  deducted  from  Lessor's  share  of  production  as  long  as  they  are  based  on  Lessee's 
actual  transportation  cost  of  such  enhancements.  In  no  event  shall  Lessor  receive  a 
price  that  is  less  than,  or  more  than,  the  price  received  by  Lessee  from  an  unaffiliated 
third  party  purchaser; 

(c)  on  gas,  including  casing  head  gas  and  all  gaseous  substances,  produced  from  said  land 
and  used  off  said  land  by  Lessee  and  not  benefiting  Lessor,  the  total  value  of  all  benefits 
and/or  consideration  received  by  Lessee,  or  any  related,  affiliated,  and/or  associated 
entity  from  the  sale  and/or  other  dispositions  of  such  gas  and/or  gaseous  substances. 
Such  25%  shall  not  bear  any  costs  and/or  expenses  of  any  kind  including  but  not  limited 
to  production,  pre-production,  post-production,  severance,  compression,  treating, 


gathering,  transportation  and  other  excise  taxes  and/or  other  cost  incurred  by  Lessee  in 
transporting,  delivering,  processing,  compressing,  or  otherwise  making  such  gas  and/or 
gaseous  substance  merchantable.  However,  any  such  transportation  costs  which  result 
in  enhancing  the  value  of  the  of  the  marketable  oil,  gas  or  other  products  to  receive  a 
better  price  may  be  deducted  from  Lessor's  share  of  production  as  long  as  they  are 
based  on  Lessee's  actual  transportation  cost  of  such  enhancements.  In  no  event  shall 
Lessor  receive  a  price  that  is  less  than,  or  more  than,  the  price  received  by  Lessee 
from  an  unaffiliated  third  party  purchaser; 

(d)  If  the  gas  from  any  well  producing  from  this  lease  should  be  sufficiently 
impregnated  with  gasoline,  condensate  or  other  liquid  hydrocarbons  in  suspension 
that  paying  quantities  of  such  gasoline,  condensate  or  other  product  can  be  separated 
from  said  gas  and  liquefied  as  a  practical  lease  operation  by  the  installation  by 
Lessee  of  traps,  separators  or  other  devices  ordinarily  used  in  the  industry  for  such 
purpose  at  the  well  site,  then  Lessee  agrees  and  shall  be  obligated  to  install  at  the 
well  site  such  device  or  devices  to  the  end  that  so  much  of  said  gasoline,  condensate 
or  other  products  as  can  be  separated  through  such  devices  before  marketing  be 
recovered  and  Lessor  shall  receive  its  royalty  as  specified  in  paragraph  3(a)  of  the 
gasoline,  condensate  or  other  liquefied  products  recovered  from  the  lease  in  such 
manner,  together  with  a  royalty  on  separated  gas  in  the  amount  and  determined  as 
provided  in  paragraph  3(b)  or  3(c)  hereof,  as  applicable; 

(e)  If  gas  or  casinghead  gas  or  separated  gas  resulting  from  field  separation  produced 
from  the  land  subject  to  this  lease  is  processed  by  or  for  the  account  of  lessee  (or  any 
company  or  other  entity  with  which  lessee  is  affiliated  by  stock  ownership  or 
otherwise)  for  the  recovery  of  liquid  hydrocarbons  therefrom  in  a  gas  processing, 
absorption,  stripping  or  similar  plant,  then  in  lieu  of  royalties  provided  in  paragraphs 
3(b),  and  3(c)  a  royalty  of  25%  of  the  market  value  at  the  plant  tailgate  of  all  liquid 
hydrocarbons  recovered  and  saved  in  such  plant  and  attributable  to  gas  produced 
from  the  land,  less  25%  of  the  reasonable  direct  costs  (excluding  amortization  and 
depreciation  on  pipeline  and  plant  investment  and  direct  overhead  associated 
therewith)  of  processing  such  gas  in  the  plant  for  the  recovery  of  such  liquid 
hydrocarbons,  plus  a  royalty  on  residue  gas  resulting  from  such  plant  operation 
attributable  to  gas  produced  from  the  land  subject  to  this  lease  in  the  amount  and 
determined  as  provided  in  paragraphs  3(b)  and  3(c)  hereof; 

(f)  Any  monies  received  by  Lessee,  or  by  any  company  or  other  entity  with  which 
Lessee  is  affiliated  by  stock  ownership  or  otherwise,  under  or  with  respect  to  any 
agreement  for  the  sale,  use,  or  other  disposition  of  oil  or  gas  production  from  or 
attributable  to  the  premises  in  the  nature  of  (i)  a  prepayment  for  deliveries  of  such 
production  to  be  made  at  a  future  date  (or  for  deliveries  of  such  production  which  the 
purchaser  thereof  may  request  at  a  future  date),  including,  without  limitation,  any 
"advance  payments"  or  "take-or-pay  payments,"  (ii)  a  payment  to  modify  the  gas 
price  or  any  other  terms  of  a  contract,  or  to  terminate  or  rescind  such  contract  or 
delay  performance  thereunder,  and  (iii)  any  and  all  other  sums  or  other  consideration 
paid  or  to  be  paid  to  compromise  claims  in  respect  of  such  contract,  shall  be  deemed 


proceeds  of  production  from  the  leased  premises  when  received  by  Lessee  and 
royalty  thereon  under  this  lease  shall  be  due  and  owing  as  if  such  production  were 
produced  and  sold,  used,  or  otherwise  disposed  of;  provided,  that  all  royalty  amounts 
paid  in  respect  of  such  payments  shall  be  credited  against  and  deducted  from  the 
royalty  amounts  due  when  and  if  production  from  the  leased  premises  in  respect  of 
which  such  payments  were  received  is  delivered  by  Lessee  to  the  purchaser  thereof. 

(g)  If  at  any  time,  whether  before  or  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  Lessee 
shall  have  completed  a  well  or  wells  bottomed  under  or  passing  under  the  above 
described  premises  which  well  or  wells  are  capable  of  producing  gas  in  commercial 
quantities  but  are  shut-in  with  the  result  that  gas  is  not  produced  and  sold  or  used, 
Lessee  shall  pay  as  royalty  to  royalty  owners  for  each  such  shut-in  well  on  or  before 
the  expiration  of  ninety  (90)  days  after  (i)  the  date  of  completion  of  such  gas  well  as 
evidenced  by  the  Well  Completion  Report  filed  with  the  appropriate  state  or  other 
governmental  regulatory  agency  or  commission  having  jurisdiction,  or  (ii)  the  date 
such  gas  ceases  to  be  sold  or  used,  as  the  case  may  be,  an  amount  equal  to  Fifty 
Dollars  ($50.00)  per  acre  of  land  attributed  to  the  producing  unit  surrounding  the 
well  or  wells  bottomed  under  or  passing  under  the  leased  premises.  It  will  be 
considered  that  each  such  well  is  producing  gas  in  paying  quantities  within  the 
meaning  of  this  lease  for  a  period  of  one  (1)  year  after  the  expiration  of  said  ninety 
(90)  day  period.  In  like  manner  and  upon  like  payments  being  made  annually  on  or 
before  the  expiration  of  the  last  preceding  year  for  which  such  payment  or  tender  has 
been  made,  it  will  be  considered  that  said  well  or  wells  are  producing  gas  in 
commercial  quantities  for  successive  periods  of  one  (1)  year;  provided,  however,  that 
tins  lease  may  not  be  maintained  in  force  solely  by  payment  of  shut-in  gas  well 
royalty  for  any  well  under  this  paragraph  for  more  than  two  (2)  consecutive  years 
after  the  effective  date  of  the  first  such  payment,  or  for  shorter  periods  at  various 
intervals  not  to  exceed  in  the  aggregate  four  (4)  years  in  all.  Said  shut-in  gas  royalty 
payments  shall  be  a  debt  of  the  Lessee  and  not  a  conditional  limitation.  Said 
payments  shall  be  made  to  Lessor  at  the  address  provided  above;  provided,  however, 
any  owner  of  royalty  may  designate  a  different  depository  bank  in  writing. 

(h)  Accounting  and  payment  to  Lessor  of  royalties  from  production  of  oil  and 
gas  as  herein  provided  shall  commence  no  later  than  ninety  (90)  days  following  the 
first  month  of  production.  Thereafter,  unless  otherwise  specifically  provided  herein, 
all  accounting  and  payments  of  royalties  shall  be  made  on  or  before  the  last  day  of 
the  second  calendar  month  following  the  calendar  month  in  which  the  production 
occurred.  Unless  otherwise  herein  expressly  provided,  any  royalties  or  other 
payments  provided  for  in  this  lease  which  are  suspended  or  not  paid  to  Lessor  within 
the  time  period  specified  therefore  shall  accrue  interest  at  the  rate  of  eighteen  percent 
(18%)  per  annum  (or  if  lesser,  the  highest  rate  permitted  by  applicable  law)  from  due 
date  until  paid.  Acceptance  by  Lessor,  its  successors,  agents  or  assigns,  of  royalties 
which  are  past  due  shall  not  act  as  a  waiver  or  estoppel  of  its  right  to  receive  or 
recover  any  and  all  interest  due  thereon  under  the  provisions  hereof,  unless  the 
written  acceptance  or  acknowledgment  by  Lessor  to  Lessee  expressly  so  provides.  If 
Lessee  shall  assert  by  written  notice  to  one  or  more  royalty  owners  that  a  good-faith, 


bonaflde  dispute  exists,  based  on  an  attorney's  written  opinion  which  is  included 
with  Lessee's  notice  as  to  the  entitlement  of  Lessor  to  payment  of  such  royalties, 
Lessee  may  then  satisfy  its  obligations  to  pay  such  disputed  royalties  hereunder  by 
paying  such  disputed  royalty  to  a  Trustee  acceptable  to  both  parties,  which  Trustee 
shall  retain  and  invest  such  disputed  royalties  in  interest  bearing  accounts  approved 
by  Lessor  pending  resolution  of  the  royalty  entitlement  dispute  with  interest  to 
belong  to  the  rightful  royalty  owner.  If  Lessor  and  Lessee  cannot  agree  on  a  Trustee 
to  hold  and  invest  the  disputed  royalties  within  fifteen  (15)  days  after  Lessee's  notice 
or  if  the  royalty  entitlement  dispute  has  not  been  settled  and  resolved  within  sixty 
(60)  days  after  Lessee's  notice,  then  Lessee,  upon  request  by  one  or  more  Lessors 
shall  institute  an  interpleader  action  and  tender  the  disputed  royalties  plus  any 
interest  accrued  thereon  into  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  to  be  held  and  invested 
under  the  direction  of  court;  provided  however  that  Lessee  shall  not  be  entitled  to 
claim  any  attorneys  fees,  costs,  expenses,  or  other  deductions  which  Lessee  claims 
are  associated  with  the  institution  of  such  interpleader  action  from  the  funds  to  be 
interpleaded  into  the  Court. 


5.  Lessee  may  pool  all  or  any  portion  of  the  lands  covered  by  this  lease.  The  unit  formed 
by  such  pooling  for  an  oil  well  shall  not  exceed  40  acres  plus  a  maximum  acreage  tolerance 
of  10%,  and  for  a  gas  well  or  a  horizontal  completion  shall  not  exceed  640  acres  plus  a 
maximum  acreage  tolerance  of  10%;  provided,  however,  that  in  the  event  any  Federal  or 
state  law,  or  any  order,  rule  or  regulation  of  the  appropriate  state  or  other  governmental 
regulatory  agency  or  commission  having  jurisdiction  prescribes  or  permits  a  spacing 
pattern  for  the  development  of  the  field,  or  allocates  a  producing  allowable  in  whole  or  in 
part  based  on  acreage  per  well,  then  any  producing  unit  retained  hereunder  shall  include 
only  the  minimum  acreage  as  may  be  so  prescribed  or  permitted  or  as  may  be  used  in 
such  allocation  or  allowable.  For  the  purpose  of  the  foregoing,  the  term  "horizontal 
completion"  means  a  well  in  which  the  horizontal  component  of  the  gross  completion 
interval  in  the  reservoir  is  at  least  five  hundred  (500)  feet,  hi  exercising  its  pooling  rights 
hereunder,  Lessee  shall  file  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  unit  and  stating  the 
effective  date  of  pooling.  Production,  drilling,  completion,  or  reworking  operations  anywhere 
on  a  unit  which  includes  all  or  any  part  of  the  leased  premises  shall  be  treated  as  if  it  were 
production,  drilling,  completion  or  reworking  operations  on  the  leased  premises,  except  that 
the  production  on  which  Lessors  royalty  is  calculated  shall  be  that  proportion  of  the  total  unit 
production  which  the  net  acreage  covered  by  this  lease  and  included  in  the  unit  bears  to  the 
total  gross  acreage  in  the  unit.  Pooling  in  one  or  more  instances  shall  not  exhaust  Lessee's 
pooling  rights  hereunder,  and  Lessee  shall  have  the  recurring  right  but  not  the  obligation  to 
revise  any  unit  formed  hereunder  by  expansion  or  contraction  or  both,  either  before  or  after 
commencement  of  production,  so  long  as  the  total  acreage  therein  does  not  exceed  the 
maximum  herein  specified.  Also  each  such  drilling  or  production  unit,  when  limited  to  any  one 
or  more  formations  and  to  any  one  or  more  of  the  minerals  therein  or  produced  therefrom, 
may  from  time  to  time  during  the  primary  term  be  enlarged  and  extended  by  lessee  to  include 
additionally  any  other  formation  or  formations  and  any  other  mineral  or  minerals  therein  or 
produced  therefrom,  hi  making  such  a  revision,  Lessee  shall  file  or  record  a  written 


declaration  describing  the  revised  unit  and  stating  the  effective  date  of  revision.  To  the  extent 
any  portion  of  the  leased  premises  is  included  in  or  excluded  from  the  unit  by  virtue  of  such 
revision,  the  proportion  of  unit  production  on  which  royalties  are  payable  hereunder  shall 
thereafter  be  adjusted  accordingly.  In  the  absence  of  production  in  paying  quantities  from  a 
unit,  or  upon  permanent  cessation  thereof,  Lessee  may  terminate  the  unit  by  filing  of  record  a 
written  declaration  describing  the  unit  and  stating  the  date  of  tennination.  Pooling  hereunder 
shall  not  constitute  a  cross-conveyance  of  interests.  Anything  in  this  lease  to  the  contrary 
notwithstanding,  in  the  event  only  a  part,  or  parts,  of  the  land  covered  by  this  lease  is 
pooled  or  consolidated  with  other  land  or  lands,  operations  on  or  production  from  such 
pooled  unit  or  units  will  maintain  this  lease  in  force  only  as  to  the  land  covered  hereby 
which  is  included  in  such  unit  or  units  and,  following  expiration  of  the  primary  term  of 
this  lease,  only  as  to  the  strata  or  stratum  from  which  production  of  oil,  liquid 
hydrocarbons,  gas  or  their  respective  constituent  products  is  obtained  by  the  unit  well  or 
wells. 

6.  Subject  to  other  provisions  of  this  lease,  with  respect  to  drilling  operations  on,  and 
acreage  held  by,  this  lease,  during  and  following  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  the 
following  provision  shall  govern: 

(a)  In  the  event  Lessee  at  any  time  drills  a  dry  hole  bottomed  under  or  passing  under 
said  land  and  no  oil,  liquid  hydrocarbons,  gas  or  their  respective  constituent  products 
(collectively  referred  to  in  this  paragraph  6  as  "oil  or  gas")  is  then  being  produced 
hereunder,  or  in  the  event  all  production  of  oil  or  gas  from  said  land  should  at  any 
time  cease  for  any  cause,  this  lease  shall  continue  in  effect  for  a  period  of  sixty 
(60)days  from  abandonment  of  such  dry  hole  or  cessation  of  production  and  may  be 
continued  thereafter  if  Lessee  commences  drilling  operations  under  said  land  within 
said  60-day  period,  this  lease  shall  continue  in  effect,  subject  to  the  provisions  of 
subparagraph  (d)  hereof,  as  long  as  drilling  operations  are  prosecuted  with  reasonable 
diligence  and  thereafter  as  long  as  oil  or  gas  is  produced  hereunder;  or 

(b)  If  no  oil  or  gas  is  being  produced  hereunder  at  the  expiration  of  the  primary 
term  but  Lessee  is  then  engaged  in  drilling  operations,  or  within  the  60-day  period 
specified  in  subparagraph  (a)  above  Lessee  commences  drilling  operations,  this  lease 
shall  continue  in  effect  in  the  manner  and  for  the  time  specified  in  subparagraph  (d) 
hereof. 

(c)  The  term  "drilling  operations"  whenever  used  in  this  lease  shall  mean  and 
include  operations  for  drilling  a  well;  reworking  operations;  and  reconditioning, 
deepening,  plugging  back,  cleaning  out,  repairing  or  testing  of  a  well.  For  all 
purposes  of  this  lease,  drilling  operations  shall  be  deemed  to  be  prosecuted  with 
reasonable  diligence  when  prosecuted  without  cessation  of  more  than  thirty  (30) 
consecutive  days  or  when  no  more  than  sixty  (60)  consecutive  days  elapse  between 
the  completion  of  all  (or  substantially  all)  operations  at  one  well  or  location  and  the 
commencement  of  drilling  operations  at  another  well  or  location. 


(d)  Anything  in  this  lease  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,  it  is  understood  and 
agreed  that  this  lease  shall  terminate  at  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  as  to  all 
lands  held  under  this  lease  at  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  except  for  any 
producing  tracts  as  described  below,  unless  Lessee  is  then  engaged  in  drilling 
operations  on  this  lease  or,  within  the  60-day  period  preceding  the  expiration  of  the 
primary  term,  Lessee  shall  have  completed  or  abandoned  a  well  drilled  on  this  lease. 
In  either  of  such  events,  this  lease  shall  continue  in  force,  as  to  all  lands  held  under 
this  lease  at  the  expiration  of  such  primary  term,  only  so  long  as  Lessee  is  engaged  in 
continuous  drilling  operations  under  said  land,  and  drilling  operations  shall  be 
deemed  continuous  if  not  more  than  sixty  (60)  days  (commencing  on  the  day  of 
completion  or  abandonment  in  the  case  of  a  well  completed  or  abandoned  within  the 
60-day  period  preceding  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term)  elapse  between  the 
completion  or  abandonment  of  one  well  and  the  commencement  of  drilling 
operations  for  another  well.  At  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  unless  the 
continuous  drilling  provisions  specified  above  in  this  subparagraph  (d)  shall  then  be 
applicable,  or  at  such  later  date  as  Lessee  shall  fail  to  continuously  drill  this  lease 
within  the  60-day  time  periods  specified  above  for  continuous  drilling  operations  in 
effect  at  the  end  of  the  primary  term,  this  lease  shall  terminate  except  as  follows: 

(1)  If  Lessee  has  completed  a  well  bottomed  under  or  passing  under  said  land 
which  is  classified  as  an  oil  well  by  the  appropriate  state  or  other  governmental 
regulatory  agency  or  commission  having  jurisdiction  and  is  producing,  or  capable 
of  producing,  oil  in  commercial  quantities,  then  this  lease  shall  continue  in  effect 
as  to  a  tract  of  Forty  and  no/100  (40)  acres  around  each  such  well  bore  down  to 
but  not  below  100'  below  the  stratigraphic  equivalent  of  the  deepest  depth  at 
which  such  well  is  completed  as  a  well  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities; 

(2)  If  Lessee  has  completed  a  well  bottomed  under  or  passing  under  said  land 
which  is  classified  as  a  gas  well  by  the  appropriate  state  or  other  governmental 
regulatory  agency  or  commission  having  jurisdiction  and  is  producing,  or  capable 
of  producing,  gas  in  commercial  quantities,  then  this  lease  shall  continue  in  effect 
as  to  a  tract  of  Six  Hundred  Forty  and  no/100  (640)  acres  around  each  such  well 
bore  down  to  but  not  below  100'  below  the  stratigraphic  equivalent  of  the  deepest 
depth  at  which  such  well  is  completed  as  a  well  capable  of  producing  in  paying 
quantities; 

provided,  however,  that  in  the  event  any  Federal  or  state  law,  or  any  order,  rule  or 
regulation  of  the  appropriate  state  or  other  governmental  regulatory  agency  or 
commission  having  jurisdiction  prescribes  or  permits  a  spacing  pattern  for  the 
development  of  the  field,  or  allocates  a  producing  allowable  in  whole  or  in  part  based  on 
acreage  per  well,  then  any  producing  unit  retained  hereunder  shall  include  only  the 
minimum  acreage  as  may  be  so  prescribed  or  permitted  or  as  may  be  used  in  such 
allocation  or  allowable. 

Thereafter,  the  leasehold  rights  as  to  each  such  particular  tract  (that  is,  the  applicable  oil 
spacing  unit  and  the  applicable  gas  allowable  unit,  as  the  case  may  be)  shall  continue 


effective  as  to  the  particular  tract  down  to  the  depths  as  specified  above  so  long  and  only 
so  long  as  said  tract  continues  to  produce  hereunder  and  so  long  thereafter  as  Lessee  may 
be  conducting  operations  under  said  particular  tract  with  the  view  of  developing  and/or 
restoring  production  therefrom  and  with  no  cessation  of  such  operations  on  a  well  or 
wells  thereunder  for  more  than  sixty  (60)  days  until  production  from  such  tract  is 
restored.  Each  such  tract  shall  be  selected  by  Lessee  as  a  pooled  unit  and  shall,  as  nearly 
as  practicable,  be  in  the  form  of  a  rectangle  with  the  well  by  virtue  of  which  same  is  held 
located  parallel  to  the  longest  axis  thereof  and  equidistant  from  its  sides  .  It  is  the 
intention  of  the  parties  hereto  that  each  such  tract  shall  be  treated  as  constituting  a 
separate  lease  and  neither  production  from  nor  operations  on  any  such  tract  shall  maintain 
this  lease  in  force  as  to  any  other  such  tract.  At  the  end  of  the  primary  term,  Lessee  shall 
file  a  written  designation  in  the  appropriate  records  of  Tarrant  County  designating  the 
Producing  Unit  for  each  well  drilled  upon  or  including  any  portion  of  the  leased 
premises. 

7.  In  the  event  a  unit  is  formed  hereunder  for  a  horizontal  completion  before  the 
horizontal  completion  is  completed  or  within  ninety  (90)  days  after  the  horizontal 
completion  is  completed,  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  to  revise  the  configuration  and  size 
of  the  unit  within  ninety  (90)  days  after  the  horizontal  completion  is  completed.  Such 
right  to  designate  a  revised  unit  may  be  exercised  by  Lessee  only  twice  during  said  90- 
day  period.  To  so  revise  a  unit  designated  for  a  horizontal  completion,  Lessee  shall  file  of 
record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  revised  unit  and  stating  the  effective  date  of 
revision.  After  the  expiration  of  said  90-day  period,  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  to  revise 
tire  configuration  and  size  of  a  unit  formed  or  previously  revised  hereunder  for  a 
horizontal  completion;  provided,  however,  no  such  revision  shall  be  valid  as  to  and 
binding  upon  Lessor  if  the  interest  of  Lessor  in  unit  production  after  giving  effect  to  the 
designation  of  such  revised  unit  is  less  than  the  interest  that  Lessor  owned  in  unit 
production  prior  to  the  designation  of  such  revised  unit. 

8.  In  the  event  a  well  or  wells  producing  oil  or  gas  in  paying  quantities  should  be 
brought  in  on  adjacent  land  and  draining  the  leased  premises,  Lessee  agrees  to  drill  such 
offset  wells  as  a  reasonably  prudent  operator  would  drill  under  the  same  or  similar 
circumstances.  If  oil  or  gas  is  discovered  on  the  land  covered  by  this  lease,  Lessee  agrees 
to  further  develop  the  land  covered  by  this  lease  as  a  reasonable  and  prudent  operator 
would  under  the  same  or  similar  circumstances  observing  at  all  times  the  stipulations  of 
Clause  9  of  this  document. 

9.  Lessee  agrees  that  no  water  from  Lessor's  wells,  tank,  ponds,  lakes,  rivers, 
streams,  springs,  or  other  surface  water  located  on  or  crossing  Lessor's  lands  or 
underground  fresh  water  will  be  used  in  the  conduct  of  any  of  its  operations.  Lessee  shall 
comply  with  applicable  state  and  Federal  regulations  in  disposition  (by  reinjection  or 
otherwise)  of  salt  water,  brine  or  other  fluids  utilized  in  or  resulting  from  operations,  and 
shall  not  cause  or  permit  any  such  substances  to  damage  or  pollute  the  surface  of  the 
leased  premises  or  any  fresh  water  sands  lying  thereunder.  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  at 
any  time  within  sixty  (60)  days  after  the  expiration  of  this  lease  and  provided  Lessee  is 
not  in  default  hereunder  to  remove  all  property  and  fixtures  placed  by  Lessee  around  the 
periphery  of  said  land,  including  the  right  to  draw  and  remove  all  casing  except  casing  in 


water  wells,  and  Lessee  shall  do  nothing  that  will  in  any  way  damage  any  water  well  or 
prevent  its  future  use  by  Lessor.  However,  if  Lessor  so  elects,  Lessee  agrees  to  remove 
the  casing  from  and  plug  and  abandon  water  wells  at  Lessee's  sole  expense. 

a.  Lessee  understands  that  the  majority  of  the  land  described  in  Exhibit 
"A"  has  been  platted  for  residential  purposes.  Lessee  agrees  that  it 
shall  not  use  the  surface  of  the  land_as  a  drill  site,  injection  well  site, 
repressuring  site,  pressure  maintenance  site,  cycling  and/or 
secondary  or  tertiary  recovery  operation  site,  gathering  station,  frac 
tank,  frac  pond,  frac  pit,  mud  pit,  or  for  any  other  facilities  or 
vehicular  traffic  related  to  drilling  and/or  production  off  of  the 
county  roads.  Further,  no  drilling  activity  on  any  lands  adjoining  the 
leased  premises  shall  occur  within  600'  of  any  existing  structure 
located  on  the  leased  premises.  All  drilling  activities  conducted  within 
500'  of  the  lands  described  in  Exhibit  "A"  shall  employ  a  closed  loop  "zero 
discharge  system"  or  similar  technology  for  drilling  the  well.  All  mud, 
drill  cuttings,  sewage,  produced  water,  etc.  will  be  collected  for  disposal 
at  state-approved  disposal  facilities,  or  disposed  down  the  well  annulus. 
Where  feasible,  excess  materials  and  drill  cuttings  will  be  stored  on  the 
drill  location  in  order  to  coordinate  the  removal  of  such  materials.  For  all 
drilling  activities  conducted  within  600'  but  more  than  500'  of  the  lands 
described  in  Exhibit  "A"  in  which  drilling  mud  is  used  and  pits  are  used  to 
collect  fluids  used  in  such  operations,  such  pits  shall  not  be  located  on  any 
lands  described  in  Exhibit  "A"  and  all  such  pits  located  within  600'  of  the 
property  described  in  Exhibit  "A"  shall  be  lined  with  an  impenetrable 
material  so  as  not  to  allow  any  drilling  fluids,  additives,  oil  or  other 
substances  to  penetrate  the  soil  of  the  leased  premises.  Lessee  shall  comply 
with  all  regulatory  and  statutory  requirements  in  the  use  and  construction  of 
all  pits  utilized  with  drilling  operations  on  the  lease  premises. 

1 0.  Within  sixty  (60)  days  of  the  completion  of  drilling  and  completion  operations  on  a  well  on 
any  lands  adjoining  the  lands  described  in  Exhibit  "A"  Lessee  shall  restore  the  surface  to  the 
same  condition  in  which  it  was  found  immediately  prior  to  any  use  thereof  as  much  as 
reasonably  possible.  All  oil-based  mud  and  other  oil-based  or  salt-water  based  drilling  fluids  shall 
be  vacuumed  from  the  pits  and  disposed  of  properly  off  the  leased  premises  by  Lessee,  all  pits  and 
other  excavations  shall  be  backfilled  and  leveled  by  Lessee,  weather  permitting,  and  the  site  shall  be 
cleaned  and  all  trash,  garbage,  junk,  pieces  of  iron,  pipes,  unused  equipment  and  other  debris  shall 
be  removed  by  Lessee. 

11.  Lessee  shall  keep  the  leased  premises  and  adjacent  lands  clean  and  free  of  all 
trash  and  litter  which  may  emanate  from  Lessee's  operations.  Under  no  circumstances 
will  Lessee  bury  or  burn  any  trash,  debris  or  foreign  material  of  any  nature  within  500 
feet  of  the  leased  premises. 

12.  Lessee  shall  not  assign  this  lease  in  whole  or  in  part,  nor  any  interest  therein, 
without  the  prior  written  consent  of  Lessor,  which  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably 
withheld;  provided  however,  that  Lessor  may  withhold  such  consent  if  Lessor  reasonably 
believes  that  any  assignee  or  transferee  of  this  lease  who  will  assume  duties  as  operator 


does  not  have  a  net  worth  equal  to  or  better  than  Lessee  or  the  capability  of  operating  the 
lease  in  a  manner  comparable  in  the  manner  in  which  Lessee  operated  the  lease  or  the 
financial  ability  to  perform  Lessee's  obligations  hereunder.  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  to 
assign  this  lease  without  Lessor  consent  if  such  assignment  is  begin  made  to  Chesapeake 
Exploration,  L.L.C.,  its  successors  in  interest,  or  its  officers,  directors,  and/or 
subsidiaries. 

13.  Lessee  shall  not  be  liable  for  delays  or  defaults  in  its  performance  of  any 
agreement  or  covenant  hereunder  (other  than  any  covenant  or  agreement  which  relates  to 
the  payment  of  money)  due  to  force  majeure.  The  term  "force  majeure"  as  employed 
herein  shall  mean  any  act  of  God,  including  but  not  limited  to  storms,  floods,  washouts, 
landslides,  and  lightning.  This  lease  is  expressly  made  subject  to,  and  Lessee  in  its 
operations  hereunder  shall  comply  with  applicable  requirements  of,  all  Federal  and  state 
laws,  and  rules  and  regulations  of  any  governmental  authority,  state  or  Federal,  having 
jurisdiction  in  the  premises,  and  nothing  herein  contained  shall  be  construed  as  requiring 
Lessee  to  violate  any  such  laws,  rules  or  regulations  or  to  penalize  Lessee  for  complying 
therewith.  If  Lessee  is  required,  ordered  or  directed  by  any  Federal  or  state  law,  or  any 
order,  rule  or  regulation  of  governmental  authority  to  cease  drilling,  reworking  or 
producing  operations  on  the  land  covered  by  this  lease,  or  if  Lessee  by  force  majeure  is 
prevented  from  conducting  such  operations,  then  until  such  time  as  such  law,  order,  rule, 
regulation  or  force  majeure  is  terminated  and  for  a  period  of  sixty  (60)  days  after  such 
termination  each  and  every  provision  of  this  lease  or  implied  covenant  arising  thereunder 
that  might  operate  to  tenninate  this  lease  or  the  estate  conveyed  by  it  (other  than  any 
covenant  or  agreement  which  relates  to  the  payment  of  money)  shall  be  suspended  and 
inoperative  and  this  lease  shall  continue  in  full  force  and  effect;  provided,  however,  that 
in  no  event  shall  the  term  hereof  be  so  extended  for  a  period  of  more  than  two  (2)  years 
solely  by  reason  of  this  paragraph.  The  protections  afforded  by  this  paragraph  shall  not 
apply  to  any  occurrence  or  cause  within  the  control  of  Lessee,  or  which  could  have  been 
prevented  by  Lessee,  in  the  exercise  of  reasonable  prudence;  and,  Lessee  shall  take  all 
reasonable  actions  to  remove  or  end  any  triggering  cause  of  the  protections  of  this 
paragraph  as  soon  as  reasonably  possible.  In  no  event  shall  this  lease  be  perpetuated  by 
the  provisions  of  this  paragraph  9  for  a  period  of  more  than  one  (1)  consecutive  year,  or 
two  (2)  years  of  cumulative  time. 

14.  The  breach  by  Lessee  of  any  obligation  arising  hereunder  shall  not  work  an 
immediate  forfeiture  or  termination  of  this  lease  nor  cause  a  termination  or  reversion  of 
the  estate  created  hereby  nor  be  grounds  for  cancellation  hereof  in  whole  or  in  part.  In  the 
event  Lessor  considers  that  Lessee  has  breached  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Lease, 
Lessor  shall  notify  Lessee  in  writing  of  such  breach.  Lessee  shall  have  thirty  (30)  days 
after  receipt  of  notice  to  remedy  said  breach.  Failure  to  remedy  such  breach  shall 
tenninate  this  Lease  and  Lessor  shall  forfeit  all  rights  to  the  oil,  gas  and  other  minerals  in 
any  lands  covered  by  this  lease  which  are  not  otherwise  held  by  actual  and  continuous 
production  of  oil,  gas  and  other  minerals  or  the  conduct  of  operations  as  set  forth  herein. 
After  the  discovery  of  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  in  paying  quantities  on  said  land,  Lessee 
shall  reasonably  develop  the  acreage  retained  hereunder,  but  in  discharging  this 
obligation  it  shall  in  no  event  be  required  to  drill  more  than  one  (1)  well  per  forty  (40) 


acres,  plus  an  acreage  tolerance  not  to  exceed  ten  per  cent  (10%)  of  forty  (40)  acres  of  the 
area  retained  hereunder  and  capable  of  producing  oil  in  paying  quantities  and  one  (1)  well 
per  six  hundred  forty  (640)  acres,  plus  an  acreage  tolerance  not  to  exceed  ten  per  cent 
(10%)  of  six  hundred  forty  (640)  acres  of  the  area  retained  hereunder  and  capable  of 
producing  gas  or  other  mineral  in  paying  quantities  or  a  horizontal  completion  unless  the 
Texas  Railroad  Commission  shall  specify  smaller  well  spacing  allowances.  Should  the 
Texas  Railroad  Commission  specify  smaller  well  spacing  allowances  by  issuance  of  field 
rules  or  otherwise,  Lessee  shall  be  required  to  drill  one  well  for  each  specified  well 
spacing  allowance.  All  drilling  done  under  this  provision  will  be  conducted  with  respect 
to  the  prohibitions  of  Clause  9  against  performing  drilling  or  production  operations  from 
the  surface  of  the  leased  area. 

15.  Lessor  hereby  agrees  that  Lessee  at  its  option,  may  discharge  any  tax,  mortgage 
or  other  lien  upon  said  land  in  the  event  of  default  of  payment  by  Lessor,  and  in  the  event 
Lessee  does  so,  it  shall  be  subrogated  to  such  lien  with  the  right  to  enforce  same  and  apply 
royalties  accruing  hereunder  toward  satisfying  same.  Without  impairment  of  Lessee's 
rights  under  the  warranty  in  the  event  of  failure  of  title,  it  is  agreed  that,  if  Lessor  owns 
an  interest  in  said  land  less  than  the  entire  fee  simple  estate,  whether  stated  herein  above 
as  a  whole  or  partial  interest,  their  the  royalties  to  be  paid  Lessor  shall  be  reduced 
proportionately.  All  royalty  interest  covered  by  this  lease  (whether  or  not  owned  by  lessor) 
shall  be  paid  out  of  the  royalty  herein  provided.  Should  any  one  or  more  of  the  parties 
named  herein  above  as  Lessors  fail  to  execute  this  lease,  it  shall  nevertheless  be  binding 
upon  the  party  or  parties  executing  the  same. 

16.  Lessee,  its  successors  and  assigns,  shall  have  the  right  at  any  time  to  surrender 
this  lease,  in  whole  or  in  part,  to  Lessor  or  Lessors  heirs,  representatives,  successors  and 
assigns  by  delivering  or  mailing  a  release  thereof  to  the  Lessor,  or  by  placing  a  release 
thereof  of  record  in  the  county  in  which  said  land  is  situated;  thereupon  Lessee  shall  be 
relieved  from  all  obligations,  express  or  implied,  of  this  agreement  as  to  the  acreage  so 
surrendered,  and  thereafter  the  advance  annual  royalties  payable  hereunder  shall  be 
reduced  in  the  proportion  that  the  acreage  covered  hereby  is  reduced  by  said  release  or 
releases.  Such  release,  however,  shall  not  relieve  Lessee  of  any  cleanup,  remediation,  indemnity  or 
other  obligations  of  Lessee  ender  this  lease  with  respect  to  the  released  acreage. 

17.  Upon  Lessor's  request  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  (if  Lessee  elects  not  to 
continuously  develop)  or  the  Continuous  Development  Period,  above,  Lessee  shall  execute  and 
record  a  partial  release  containing  a  satisfactory  legal  description  of  the  acreage  not  retained 
hereunder.  Such  release,  however,  shall  not  relieve  Lessee  of  any  cleanup,  remediation,  indemnity 
or  other  obligations  of  Lessee  ender  this  lease  with  respect  to  Hie  released  acreage. 

18.  Lessee  is  hereby  given  the  option  to  extend  the  primary  term  of  this  lease  for  an 
additional  two  (2)  years  from  the  expiration  of  the  original  primary  term  hereof.  The 
option  may  be  exercised  by  Lessee  at  any  time  during  the  original  primary  term  by 
paying  the  sum  of  twenty  two  thousand,  five  hundred  &  no/100  dollars  (22,500.00)  per  net 
mineral  acre  to  Lessor  or  to  the  credit  of  Lessor  mail  to  Lessor  at  the  above  address.  This 
payment  shall  be  based  upon  the  number  of  net  mineral  acres  then  covered  by  this  lease 
&  not  at  such  time  being  maintained  by  other  provisions  hereof.  This  payment  may  be 


made  by  the  check  or  draft  of  Lessee  mailed  or  delivered  to  Lessor  or  to  said  bank  at  any 
time  during  the  original  primary  term  hereof.  If  such  bank  (or  any  successor  bank)  should 
fail,  liquidate  or  be  succeeded  by  another  bank,  or  for  any  reason  fail  or  refuse  to  accept 
payment,  Lessee  shall  not  be  held  in  default  for  failure  to  make  such  payment  until  thirty 
(30)  days  after  Lessors  delivery  to  lessee  of  a  proper  recordable  instrument  naming 
another  bank  as  agent  to  receive  such  payment.  If,  at  the  time  this  payment  is  made, 
various  parties  are  entitled  to  specific  amounts  according  to  Lessee's  records,  this 
payment  may  be  divided  between  said  parties  and  paid  in  the  same  proportion.  Should 
this  option  be  exercised  as  herein  provided,  it  shall  be  considered  for  all  purposes  as 
though  this  lease  originally  provided  for  a  primary  term  of  five  (5)  years. 

19.  Lessor  and  Lessee  agree  that  in  the  event  production  is  obtained  hereunder 
pursuant  to  which  Lessor  executes  a  division  order  or  division  orders  (or  transfer  order  or 
transfer  orders)  that  contain  terms  and  provisions  which  conflict  with  or  vary  the  terms 
and  provisions  of  this  lease,  the  terms  and  provisions  hereof  shall  control  and  Lessor  shall 
always  be  entitled  to  receive  royalties  on  the  basis  herein  provided  irrespective  of 
whether  such  payments  are  made  by  Lessee  or  by  a  third  party  purchaser  of  production. 
Any  division  order  or  transfer  order  that  Lessor  executes  shall  be  executed  solely  for  the 
purpose  of  confirming  Lessor's  interest  in  the  production  of  covered  minerals  from  the 
leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  and  in  no  event  shall  the  execution  thereof  be 
effective  to  ratify  or  revive  this  lease  irrespective  of  any  language  therein  to  the  contrary. 
Furthermore,  the  execution  by  Lessor  of  a  division  order  in  favor  of  a  third  party 
purchaser  of  production  shall  not  relieve  Lessee  of  Lessee's  obligations  hereunder  to  pay 
royalties  timely  and  properly  to  Lessor  in  the  event  such  third  party  purchaser  declares 
bankruptcy  or  otherwise  fails  or  refuses  to  pay  royalties  in  a  timely  and  proper  manner. 

20.  Lessee,  its  successors  and  assigns  agree  to  defend,  indemnify,  and  hold  harmless 
Lessor,  and  its  officers,  owners,  partners,  guests,  invitees,  and  any  of  their  respective 
heirs,  successors,  agents  and  employees  (collectively,  the  Indemnified  Parties"),  from 
any  and  all  costs,  losses,  claims,  judgments,  settlements,  and  damages  of  every  kind  and 
character  to  property  or  persons  (including  violations  of  environmental  laws  and 
regulations,  personal  injury  and  death),  lawsuits  and/or  causes  of  action  (including 
reasonable  attorneys'  fees,  expert  fees  and  court  costs),  INCLUDING  CLAIMS 
ARISING  FROM  THE  JOINT  OR  CONCURRENT  NEGLIGENCE  OF  ANY  OF 
THE  INDEMNIFIED  PARTIES,  and  including  strict  liability,  which  may  grow  out  of, 
arise  from,  or  in  any  manner  be  connected  with  the  activities  of  Lessee  and  Lessee's 
agents,  invitees,  guests,  contractors,  servants  and  employees,  whether  acting  within  the 
scope  of  their  employment  or  not,  and  whether  negligent  or  not,  on  the  leased  premises, 
or  any  adjacent  property. 

As  used  in  this  lease,  the  term  "Hazardous  Materials"  means  any  substance  defined  or 
identified  as  a  hazardous,  extra  hazardous  or  toxic  substance,  waste,  or  material  under 
any  applicable  federal,  state,  or  local  statute  or  regulation.  "Remedial  Work"  is  defined  as 
any  site  investigation  or  monitoring,  any  cleanup,  containment,  remediation,  removal,  or 
restoration  work  performed  in  response  to  any  federal,  state  or  local  government 
authority  or  private  party  action,  or  pursuant  to  any  federal,  state  or  local  statute,  rule 
regulation  or  other  laws.  Lessee  agrees  (1)  to  remove  from  the  leased  premises,  if,  as  and 


when  required  by  law,  any  Hazardous  Materials  released  thereon  by  Lessee,  (2)  to 
perform  Remedial  Work  where  the  need  therefore  arises  in  connection  with  Lessee's 
operations  or  activities  around  the  periphery  of  the  leased  premises,  and  (3)  to  comply  in 
all  respects  with  all  federal,  state  and  local  governmental  laws  and  regulations  governing 
operations  by  Lessee  and  Remedial  Work  on  or  associated  with  the  leased  premises. 
Remedial  Work  shall  be  performed  by  one  or  more  contractors  selected  by  Lessee  and 
under  the  supervision  of  a  consulting  engineer  selected  by  Lessee.  All  costs  and  expenses 
of  Remedial  Work  resulting  from  Lessee's  operations  shall  be  paid  by  Lessee,  including, 
without  limitation,  the  charges  of  such  contractors  and/or  the  consulting  engineer  and 
Lessor's  reasonable  attorneys'  fees..  Lessee  will  notify  Lessor  of  any  claim  or  other  action 
by  any  governmental  agency  or  any  third  party  involving  the  actual  or  alleged  existence 
of  Hazardous  Materials  on  the  leased  premises  or  on  Lessor's  adjoining  property  and  to 
provide  Lessor  with  copies  of  (1)  any  notice  of  any  release  of  Hazardous  Materials  given 
by  Lessee  pursuant  to  any  law  or  regulation  and  (2)  any  report  of  and  response  to  any 
such  incident.  Lessee,  its  successors  and  assigns,  will  indemnify,  pay  and  protect,  defend 
and  save  Lessor,  and  its  officers,  owners,  partners,  guests,  invitees,  and  any  of  their 
respective  heirs,  successors,  agents  and  employees,  harmless  from  all  claims,  liabilities, 
fees  and  expenses  of  any  kind  (including  attorneys'  fees  and  costs)  that  arise  from  the 
actual  or  alleged  presence  or  release  of  any  Hazardous  Materials  in  connection  with  the 
operations  of  Lessee  and  Lessee's  agents,  invitees,  guests,  contractors,  servants  and 
employees  in  the  area  of  the  leased  premises. 


21.  Lessee,  at  its  own  expense,  shall  maintain  a  general  liability  insurance  policy 
(covering  both  bodily  injury  and  property  damage  and  covering  its  indemnity  provisions 
of  this  lease)  in  an  amount  of  at  least  $10,000,000  combined  single  limit.  Lessee  shall 
also,  at  its  own  expense,  carry  worker's  compensation  insurance  as  required  by  law.  Said 
policies  shall  (i)  name  Lessor  as  an  additional  insured  (except  for  the  worker's 
compensation  policy,  which  instead  shall  include  a  waiver  of  subrogation  endorsement  in 
favor  of  Lessor),  and  (ii)  provide  that  said  insurance  shall  not  be  canceled  unless  thirty 
(30)  days  prior  written  notice  shall  have  been  given  to  Lessor.  In  addition,  such  insurance 
provided  by  Lessee  shall  be  primary  coverage  for  Lessor  when  any  policy  issued  to  Lessor 
is  similar  or  duplicate  in  coverage,  and  Lessor's  policy  shall  be  excess  over  Lessee's 
policies. 

22.  This  lease  is  subject  to  all  licenses,  permits,  easements,  rights  of  way,  surface  leases 
and  other  contracts  of  Lessor  affecting  the  surface  of  the  leased  premises. 

23.  No  waiver  of  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  lease  shall  be  deemed  or  constitute  a 
waiver  of  any  other  provision  of  this  lease,  nor  shall  such  waiver  constitute  a  continuing 
waiver  unless  otherwise  expressly  provided.  Likewise,  the  failure  of  Lessor  to  enforce 
any  provision  of  this  lease  shall  not  be  deemed  nor  shall  constitute  a  waiver  of  the  right 
of  Lessor  to  enforce  such  provision. 

24.  Any  amendment,  alteration,  extension  or  ratification  of  this  lease  or  any  term  or 
provision  of  this  lease  shall  be  made  by  an  instrument  in  writing  clearly  denominated  as 


to  its  purpose  and  effect  and  jointly  subscribed  by  the  LESSEE  and  LESSOR,  describing 
the  specific  terms  or  provisions  of  the  lease  affected  and  the  proposed  change  or 
modifications  thereof  and  executed  by  the  party  against  whom  any  such  amendment, 
alteration,  extension  or  ratification  is  sought  to  be  enforced,  and  any  purported 
amendment,  alteration,  extension  or  ratification  not  so  drafted  and  executed  shall  be  of  no 
force  and  effect. 

25.  Lessee  covenants  that  it  will  strictly  comply  with  all  applicable  laws,  regulations  and 
ordinances  in  conducting  all  operations  under  this  lease. 

26.  If  either  party  hereto  files  a  legal  action  to  enforce  any  express  or  implied 
obligation  of  this  lease  and  receives  a  favorable  judgment  from  a  court  of  competent 
jurisdiction,  then  the  losing  party  shall  reimburse  the  prevailing  party  for  all  costs  of  such 
legal  proceedings,  including  costs  incurred,  expert  witness  fees  and  reasonable  attorneys' 
fees. 

27.  Any  notice  or  other  communication  permitted  or  required  under  the  terms  hereof 
shall  be  in  writing  and,  unless  otherwise  specified,  be  deemed  properly  given  on  the  date 
personally  delivered  or  on  the  date  postmarked  if  mailed,  postage  prepaid  United  States 
mail,  addressed  to  Lessor  or  Lessee  at  the  address  set  forth  at  the  commencement  of  this 
lease,  or  to  such  other  address  as  may  hereafter  be  designated  by  either  party  to  the  other 
by  notice.  Notice  given  in  other  manner  shall  be  effective  only  if  and  when  received. 

28.  No  Warranty  of  Title.  Lessor  makes  no  warranty  of  any  kind  with  respect  to  title 
to  the  surface  or  the  mineral  estate  in  the  Property  or  any  portion  or  interest  therein.  All 
warranties  that  might  arise  at  common  law  or  by  statute,  including  but  not  limited  to 
Section  5.023  of  the  Texas  Property  Code  (or  its  successor),  are  likewise  not  provided  by 
Lessor  and  are  hereby  excluded.  By  acceptance  of  this  Lease,  Lessee  acknowledges  that 
it  has  been  provided  a  full  and  complete  opportunity  to  investigate  and  has  conducted 
sufficient  investigation  to  satisfy  itself  as  to  the  title  to  the  leased  premises.  Lessee 
assumes  all  risk  of  title  failures. 

29.  By  executing  this  document  I  hereby  acknowledge  that  I  have  am  familiar 
with  the  terms  and  conditions  contained  in  the  Amended  and  Restated  Declaration 
of  Covenants,  Conditions  and  Restrictions  for  Oakview  Estates  Recorded  in  Volume

Estates,  and  that  by  signing  this  document  I  have  waived  my  individual  right  to

portion  of  the  Declarations  which  purports  to  prohibit,  prevent  or  otherwise 
interfere  with  any  Owners  right  to  develop  the  minerals  in  and  under  the  lands
