5)  1992  Merit/NSFNET  Information  Services 


A    year  of  dedication  and  hard  work  by  the 
fjk  NSFNET  partnership  has  begun  to  pay 
X  JiL  dividends  for  network  users  as  the 
ANS  T3  technology  becomes  a  production 
tool  for  NSFNET  sites. 

As  of  March  1 ,  a  number 
of  midlevel  networks  were 
moving  their  traffic  across 
the  T3  network  and  plans 
were  in  place  to  move  the 
remaining  networks  over 
the  next  few  months. 

Merit  obtains  NSFNET 
backbone  services  from 
ANS  which  provides  a 
major  national  network 
that  operates  at  T3  speeds 
using  circuits  provided  by 
MCI  and  central  networking  technology  based 
ontheIBMRS/6000™. 

Fine-tuning  over  the  past  year 

Activities  over  the  past  twelve  months  have 
focused  on  installing  T3  technology  at  all     , 
NSFNET  sites,  re-engineering  the  early  T3 
backbone  to  expand  total  bandwidth  and  pro- 
vide greater  redundancy,  and  refining  the 
initial  developmental  hardware  and  software 
to  bring  the  level  of  reliability  up  to  produc- 
tion standards.  In  addition,  some 
organizational  changes  have  been  made  to 
ensure  a  smooth  problem-solving  path. 

The  first  stage  is  nearly  complete  and  a  plan 
is  in  place  to  deploy  higher  speed  T3  interface 
cards  which  will  increase  the  throughput  on 
all  nodes  during  second  quarter  1992. 

Strengthening  the  architecture 

When  T3  connections  were  originally  imple- 
mented at  the  beginning  of  1991,  some 
problems  were  experienced  with  the  new  ar- 


chitecture. This  led  to  a  major  effort  by 
Merit,  ANS,  IBM,  and  MCI  to  improve  the 
technology  before  T3  traffic  was  increased. 
Debugging  activities  continued  at  a  fast  pace 


NSFNET  Backbone  Service  (T3) 


through  October  1991,  until  a  reasonable 
degree  of  reliability  was  achieved. 

Peeling  the  onion 

The  problem  analysis  and  resolution  pro- 
cess has  been  compared  to  "peeling  the  skin 
of  an  onion",  as  multiple  glitches  that  at  first 
appeared  to  have  the  same  symptoms  were

The  Wide  Area  Information  Servers 
(WAIS)  system  is  a  set  of 
products  supplied  by  different  ven- 
dors to  help  end-users  find  and  retrieve 
information  over  networks.  Using  WAIS 
(pronounced  ways)  the  user  isn't  required  to 
become  familiar  with  several  different  sys- 
tems. Also,  since  the  interface  consolidates 
data  from  many  sources,  the  data  can  be  ma- 
nipulated effortlessly,  virtually  without 
regard  to  their  origins. 

Thinking  Machines,  Apple  Computer,  and 
Dow  Jones  initially  implemented  such  a  sys- 
tem for  use  by  business  executives.  These 
products  are  becoming  more  widely  avail- 
able from  various  companies. 

What  does  WAIS  do? 

Users  on  different  platforms  can  access 
personal,  company,  and  published  informa- 
tion from  one  interface.  The  information 
can  be  anything:  text,  pictures,  voice,  or 
formatted  documents.  Since  a  single  com- 
puter-to-computer protocol  is  used, 
information  can  be  stored  anywhere  on  dif- 


The  latest  and  greatest  from  the  world  of 
WAIS  was  demonstrated  for  attendees  at  a 
WAIS  seminar  held  at  the  MCNC  Center  for 
Communications  in  Research  Triangle  Park, 
NC  on  February  3  and  4. 

Participants  viewed  a  number  of  demon- 
strations of  WAIS  software  on  several 
platforms  and  were  treated  to  a  sneak  pre- 
view of  an  Apple  development  project  to 
create  a  new  Macintosh-WAIS  interface. 
The  prototype  of  this  interface  combines 


ferent  types  of  machines.  Anyone  can  use 
this  system  since  it  uses  natural  language 
questions  to  find  relevant  documents.  Rel- 
evant documents  can  be  fed  back  to  a  server 
to  refine  the  search.  This  avoids  complicated 
query  languages  and  vendor  specific  sys- 
tems. Successful  searches  can  be 
automatically  run  to  alert  the  user  when 
new  information  becomes  available. 

How  does  WAIS  work? 

The  servers  take  a  user's  question  and  do 
their  best  to  find  relevant  documents.  The 
servers,  at  this  point,  do  not  understand  the 
user's  English  language  question,  rather  they 
try  to  find  documents  that  contain  those 
words  and  phrases  and  ranks  them  based  on 
heuristics.  The  user  interfaces  (clients)  talk 
to  the  servers  using  an  extension  to  a  stan- 
dard protocol  Z39.50.  Using  a  public 
standard  allows  vendors  to  compete  with 
each  other,  while  bypassing  the  usual  propri- 
etary protocol  period  that  slows 
development.  Thinking  Machines  is  giving 
away  an  implementation  of  this  standard  to 
help  vendors  develop  clients  and  servers.

Lynch  of  the  University  of  California,

Chapel  Hill.

Where  do  WAIS  servers  exist? 

Even  though  the  system  is  very  new,  there 
are  already  several  servers: 

•  Dow  Jones  is  putting  a  server  on  their 
own  Dow  Vision  network.  This  server  con- 
tains the  Wall  Street  Journal,  Barons,  and 
450  magazines.  This  is  a  for-pay  server. 

8  Thinking  Machines  operates  a  Connec- 
tion Machine  on  the  Internet  for  free  use. 
The  databases  it  supports  are  some  patents,  a 
collection  of  molecular  biology  abstracts,  a 
cookbook,  and  the  CIA  World  Factbook. 

8  MIT  supports  a  poetry  server  with  a  great 
deal  of  classical  and  modern  poetry. 

8  Cosmic  is  serving  descriptions  of  govern- 
ment software  packages. 

8  The  Library  of  Congress  has  plans  to 
make  their  catalog  available  on  the  protocol. 

8  Weather  maps  and  forecasts  are  made 
available  by  Thinking  Machines  as  a 
repackaging  of  existing  information. 

8  The  "directory  of  servers"  facility  is  op- 
erated by  Thinking  Machines  so  that  new 
servers  can  be  easily  registered  as  either  for- 


pay  or  for-free  servers  and  users  can  find 
out  about  these  services.

As  the  migration  of  all  production 
traffic  to  the  ANS  T3  backbone 
"-nears  completion,  performance 
improvement  is  the  feature  that  will  be  most 
apparent  to  a  majority  of  users  of  NSFNET 
backbone  services.  However,  underlying  the 
visible  product  is  a  complex  foundation  of 
innovations  and  advances  which  reside  at 
the  forefront  of  network  technology. 

Architecture 

The  architecture  for  the  T3  network 
evolved  from  many  observations  made  in 
the  course  of  managing  the  Tl  network  and 
is  shown  in  the  figure  at  right. 

Packet  switches  in  the  T3  infrastructure  are 
designated  as  either  Exterior  Nodal  Switch- 
ing Subsystems  (ENSSs)  or  Core  Nodal 
Switching  Subsystems  (CNSSs).  ENSSs  are 
located  on  the  regional  network  premises 
and  CNSSs  are  co-located  at  MCI  carrier 
switching  centers  which  are  also  known  as 
"points-of-presence"  (POPs)  or  "junction 
points."  The  decision  to  co-locate  packet 
switches  within  POPs  was  key  for  several 
reasons.  Since  these  locations  are  major  car- 
rier circuit  switching  centers,  they  have  the 
full  backup  power  essential  to  the  stability 
of  the  network  and  many  are  staffed  24 
hours/day,  7  days/week. 

Additionally,  co-locating  the  CNSSs  pro- 
vides the  opportunity  to  more  closely  match 
the  carrier-provided  circuit  switched  net- 
work topology  with  packet  switched 
network  topology.  As  a  result,  path  redun- 
dancy becomes  much  easier  to  engineer. 

With  this  architecture,  the  need  for  transit 
traffic  to  traverse  the  end  nodes  is 
eliminated.  Only  traffic  specifically  sourced 
from  or  destined  to  a  given  ENSS  traverses 
the  access  link.  Consequently,  the  total 
bandwidth  needs  of  the  CNSS  cloud  are 


■Wtaft 


based  on  aggregate  requirements  because  of 
the  shared  portion  of  the  network  while 
access  link  needs  are  based  on  individual 
requirements. 

Regional  network  connections 

Currently  the  T3  infrastructure  supports 
both  Ethernet  and  FDDI  interconnection. 
The  access  into  the  CNSS  cloud  is  via  DS3 
(45  Mbs),  DS1  (1.544  Mbs)  or  DSO  (56Kbs) 
circuits.  The  network  uses  cisco™  packet 
switches  for  56  Kbs  access  into  the 
backbone. 


T3  Site 


DS3  circuits 

The  DS3  circuits  operate  in 
non-subrated  mode,  which 
means  that  the  full  45  Mbs, 
less  framing  and  carrier  man- 
agement overhead,  are 
available  for  user  traffic.  The 
physical  and  electrical  inter- 
facing to  these  lines  is  handled 
by  a  Data  Service  Unit  (DSU). 
Nearly  all  of  the  DS3  circuits 
are  carried  on  terrestrial  fiber- 
optic lines. 

Packet  switches 

The  T3  network  packet  switches  are  based 
on  the  IBM  RISC/6000™  machines  running 
code  based  on  the  AIX  operating  system, 
with  appropriate  network  adapter  hardware, 
and  packet  switching,  routing  and  network 
management  software.  In  order  to  drive  the 
DS3  lines  at  45  Mbs,  high  performance 
adapter  cards  and  software  were  required. 

To  accomplish  this,  "smart"  adapter  cards 
with  the  Intel  960CA  32-bit  microprocessor 
on  board  were  developed.  The  cards  contain 
all  information  required  to  switch  a  packet, 
including  routing  tables  and  stored

In  fact,  "smart

packets  between 
themselves 
without  any  main 
system

instruction  code  for  packet  switching.  In 
fact,  "smart  cards"  will  switch  packets 
between  themselves  without  any  main 
system  intervention,  thereby  greatly 
increasing  packet  switching  efficiency.  CPU 
intervention  is  necessary  only  when  routing 
information  is  updated.  In  addition,  the 
presence  of  a  high  speed  system  bus  (IBM's 
MicroChannel™)  ensures  that  bus  bandwidth 
will  not  restrict  packet  flow.  Deployment  of 
these  cards  at  the  POP-based  CNSS  and 
ENSS  sites  is  being  finalized.  Completion  of 
this  task  is  expected  to  take  several  months. 

Routing 

The  routing  technology  and  architecture 
used  on  the  T3  network  is  essentially  the 
same  as  the  Tl  network.  Routing  is  fully 
distributed,  with  each  NSS  exchanging  state 
information  with  other  nodes  and  then  com- 
puting the  optimal  routes.  The  Intermediate 
System-to-intermediate  System  (IS-IS)  link 
state  routing  protocol  is  used  as  the  intra-do- 
main  routing  protocol. 

In  order  to  take  advantage  of  the  new  ar- 
chitecture and  to  minimize  routing  overhead, 
exterior  information  is  transmitted  internally 
via  the  Internal  Border  Gateway  Protocol 
(IBGP).  With  over  4,500  network  numbers 
in  the  routing  tables  maximizing  the  effi- 
ciency and  controlling  the  dynamics  of  this 
information  transmission  assumes  para- 
mount importance. 

Border  Gateway  Protocol  (BGP)  or  Exte- 
rior Gateway  Protocol  (EGP)  are  used  as  the 
inter-domain  routing  protocol,  to  share 
reachability  and  routing  information  with 
the  attached  regional  networks.  Policy-based 
routing  with  tightly  controlled  routing  infor- 
mation flow  between  attached  networks 
ensures  that  the  T3  infrastructure  will  con- 
tinue to  serve  as  the  primary  transit  WAN  in 
the  global  Internet  system. 


Tl  and  T3  co-existence 

Since  the  T3  network  was  designed  as  an 
overlay  to  complement  the  existing  Tl  net- 
work and  eventually  replace  it,  controlled 
traffic  migration  from  the  Tl  to  the  T3  net- 
work posed  some  challenges. 

In  the  migration  phase,  which  is  currently 
in  progress,  some  sites  are  connected  to 
both  networks,  and  some  to  only  one.  It 
was  essential  that  a  stable  and  redundant 
cross-connect  system  be  designed  to  allow 
user  traffic  to  reach  any  site,  regardless  of 
how  the  destination  site  was  connected  or 
where  the  packet  entered  the  network. 
Regional  networks  that  were  multihomed  to 
both  Tl  and  T3  will  maintain  peering  with 
both  backbones.  This  will  allow  the  Tl 
network  to  be  used  to  connect  to  regionals 
connected  directly  to  the  Tl,  and  the  T3 
network  to  be  used  to  connect  to  regionals 
directly  connected  to  the  T3.  At  press  time 
traffic  migration  was  underway  and  a  load 
sharing  configuration  was  running  on  the 
production  network. 

T1/T3  Interconnect  Gateways 

The  routing  design  for  load  sharing  in- 
volves T1/T3  interconnect  gateways  at  Ann 
Arbor,  Houston,  San  Diego,  and  Princeton 
with  5  th  and  6th  gateways  planned  at  Den- 
ver and  Seattle.  This  scheme  is  integral  to 
maintaining  traffic  balance  and  minimizing 
congestion  at  the  interconnect  points. 

As  1992  progresses,  developers  and  engi- 
neers within  the  partnership  of  ANS,  Merit, 
IBM,  and  MCI  will  continue  to  provide  a 
leading-edge  environment  for  the  growing 
number  of  network  users.

Merit  has  received  word  that  two 
proposals,  one  for  an  Internet 
directory  project  called  TopNode, 
and  the  other  for  an  Internet  Information 
Packet  project,  have  been  accepted  by  the 
Coalition  for  Networked  Information  (CNI). 
CNI  is  a  consortium  formed  by  American 
Research  Libraries,  CAUSE,  and  EDUCOM 
to  promote  the  creation  of  and  access  to 
information  resources  in  networked 
environments  in  order  to  enrich  scholarship 
and  to  enhance  intellectual  productivity. 
Merit's  responsibilities  in  theTopNode 
project  include  sharing  knowledge  about 
network  resources,  assisting  in  the  gathering 
of  such  information,  and  creating  an  X.500 
version  of  the  TopNode  directory.

On  December  9,  1991,  the  High  Perfor- 
mance Computing  Bill  of  1991,  known  in  its 
various  iterations  as  "The  Gore  Bill"  or 
"The  NREN  Bill,"  was  signed  into  law  by 
President  Bush. 

"Congressional  action  on  the  High  Perfor- 
mance Computing  and  Communications  Bill 
provides  strong  national  recognition  of  the 
importance  of  the  national  networking  effort 
in  which  Merit,  Inc.,  has  played  a  pioneering 
role,"  commented  Dr.  Douglas  Van  Houwel- 
ing,  Merit  Board  of  Directors  member  and 
Vice-Provost  for  Information  Technology  at 
the  University  of  Michigan.  "The  hard  work 
is  just  now  beginning,  however,  for  the  ex- 


pectations of  our  colleagues  and  the  compe- 
tition for  access  are  continuing  to  rise 
rapidly.  Merit  will  continue  to  work  with 
the  networking  community  in  response  to 
these  demands."

New 

organizational 
structures  have 
been  developed 
to  enhance 
network  operation 
and  improve  the 
interaction  with 
regionals  on 
network  problems. 


discovered  and  fixed.  Problems  were  inves- 
tigated starting  at  the  circuit  level,  moving  to 
the  DSU  or  interface  hardware,  and  finally 
to  the  router  software  and  hardware. 

In  recent  months,  T3  circuit  and  router  de- 
ployment has  continued  at  the  sixteen 
NSFNET  regional  sites  with  the  last  of  these 
completed  in  November.  Nevertheless,  the 
phase-in  of  additional  production  traffic  to 
the  T3  network  was  delayed  because  of  con- 
tinuing concerns  over  reliability  and 
performance  of  the  new  technology.  These 
issues  have  been  addressed  through  a  series 
of  actions  including: 

1)  improve  the  network  software  and  hard- 
ware, 

2)  deploy  new  monitoring  tools  to  better 
track  problems, 

3)  provide  a  fallback  system  in  the  event  of 
core  node  isolation,  and 

4)  develop  new  test  strategies  to  ensure 
that  the  final  technology  implemented  would 
meet  the  standards  of  reliability  to  which 
NSFNET  users  had  become  accustomed. 

In  addition,  new  organizational  structures 
have  been  developed  to  enhance  network 
operation  and  improve  the  interaction  with 
regionals  on  network  problems. 

Visible  improvements 

At  the  top  of  the  stack  of  visible  improve- 
ments are  performance  capabilities  which 
now  exceed  that  of  most  local  networks  to 
which  users  are  attached.  The  national  infra- 
structure comprises  local/campus  area 
networks  (local  area  networks  or  LANs) 
connected  to  the  regional  and  national  net- 
works (wide  area  networks  or  WANs). 

In  the  past,  constraints  in  performance 
were  generally  related  to  the  WANs  having 
slower  speeds  than  the  LANs.  Many  LANs 
which  interconnect  to  the  regional  and 


national  networks  are  Ethernets  capable  of 
10  Mb/sec,  much  higher  than  the  maximum 
1.544  Mb/sec  of  the  Tl  networks  to  which 
the  LANs  are  attached.  In  some  cases, 
attachments  to  campus  and  other 
organization  LANs  have  been  at  speeds  of 
56  Kbps  or  less. 

Bandwidth  limitation  now  at  the  local 
level 

Implementation  of  the  T3  infrastructure 
has  produced  a  setting  in  which  backbone 
capacity  is  higher  than  much  of  the  intercon- 
necting network  bandwidth  beneath  it.  As  a 
result,  bandwidth  limitation  now  occurs  for 
most  sites  at  the  midlevel/regional  level 
rather  than  at  the  national  network  level. 
While  100  Mb/sec  Fiber  Distributed  Data 
Interface  (FDDI)  is  supported  at  some  local 
and  regional  networks,  most  have  yet  to  de- 
ploy this  technology. 

Stability  period  used  for  tests 

A  two-week  hiatus  in  December  was  de- 
clared a  period  of  "no  change"  on  the  T3 
network.  The  time  was  used  to  judge  the  sta- 
bility and  reliability  of  the  network  in  a 
steady  state  condition,  to  prepare  for  the 
cutover  of  Tl  traffic,  to  test  the  T1/T3  inter- 
connect gateway  backup,  and  to  perform 
tests  which  were  scheduled  and  coordinated 
with  the  regional  networks.  The  testing  pe- 
riod proved  successful  and  enhanced 
confidence  in  the  network. 

Safety  Net 

Safety  Net  has  been  put  in  place  as  a 
fallback  in  case  all  T3  paths  to  a  core  node 
become  unusable.  It  represents  the  addition 
of  12  Tl  links  to  interconnect  with  the  T3 
backbone  Core  Nodal  Switching  Subsystem 
(CNSS)  nodes.  These  safety  net  links  are  in-

stalled  between  the  MCI  switching  centers 
and  do  not  connect  to  the  Exterior  Nodal 
Switching  Subsystem  (ENSS)  nodes.  The  Tl 
link  metrics  are  designed  so  that  a  Tl  path  is 
used  only  if  all  other  T3  paths  to  adjacent 
CNSS  nodes  become  unreachable. 

Restructuring  of  Merit/ANS  NOC  and 
Internet  Engineering  Group 

The  NSFNET  is  a  vital  communications 
link  which  demands  a  trouble-shooting 
structure  that  is  as  efficient  and  reliable  as 
possible.  In  an  effort  to  produce  such  a 
framework  the  Network  Operations  Center 
and  Internet  Engineering  groups  have  been 
modified  to  provide  a  three-tier  problem- 
resolution  setting. 

1st  Level:  Network  Operations  Techni- 
cians. NOC  operators  will  continue  to 
provide  first  level  technical  support  for  net- 
work problems.  The  NOC  function  will 
become  more  formalized  with  emphasis  on 
reporting,  escalation,  tracking,  and  proce- 
dure execution. 

2nd  level:  National  Network  Attack 
Force.  As  part  of  the  ongoing  efforts  to  en- 
sure complete  trouble-shooting  coverage  of 
the  national  network,  the  National  Network 
Attack  Force  (NNAF)  has  been  formed.  This 
group  of  six  individuals  provides  24-hours 
per  day /seven-days  per  week  implementa- 
tion of  the  T3  network  problem  resolution 
process.  The  team  develops  NOC  diagnostic 
tools,  trains  NOC  operators,  and  performs 
network-related  tests.  The  group  reports  to 
the  IE  manager. 

3rd  Level:  Internet  Engineering  Group. 
A  number  of  the  tasks  indicated  above  were 
previously  handled  by  the  Internet  Engineer- 
ing staff.  As  the  NNAF  members  assume 
those  duties,  the  Internet  Engineers  will 
have  time  to  pursue  longer-term  engineering 


activities  and  for  attending  to  the  highest 
priority  problems  which  reach  the  third  level 
of  escalation. 

Future  T3 

The  mix  of  a  solid  foundation  plus  future 
leading  edge  technology  such  as  the  immi- 
nent deployment  of  the  new  IBM-developed, 
high-performance  interfaces  for  the  RS/ 
6000-based  routers,  helps  ensure  that  no- 
table network  performance  will  be  realized. 

As  noted  on  page  10  of  this  issue,  the  Na- 
tional Science  Board  recently  approved  a 
request  by  the  National  Science  Foundation 
to  extend  the  current  Cooperative  Agree- 
ment with  Merit  for  a  period  of  up  to  18 
months  beyond  the  November  1992  expira- 
tion date  of  the  current  contract. 

Developers  and  engineers  within  the  part- 
nership continue  to  work  toward  a  greater 
understanding  of  the  interactions  of  applica- 
tion and  network  engineering,  and  to  tune 
the  network  to  maximize  efficiency  as  the 
user  base  grows.

Page  9 


At  the  end  of  November  1992,  the 
existing  five-year  cooperative 
t  agreementwhich  the  National 
Science  Foundation  has  with  Merit  for 
NSFNET  backbone  services  comes  to  an 
end.  For  those  who  have  come  to  rely  on  the 
NSFNET  for  the  work  they  do  in  research 
and  education,  the  question  of  "what 
happens  next?"  is  critical  to  assuring 
stability  and  planning  for  the  future. 

Some  answers  are  at  hand  since  the  Na- 
tional Science  Board  met  at  the  end  of 
November  and  approved  a  plan  put  forth  by 
NSF's  Division  of  Networking  and  Commu- 
nications Research  and  Infrastructure. 

"NSF  plans  to  make  a  draft  solicitation  for 
the  Backbone  follow-on  available  sometime 
in  March  for  a  two  to  three  month  period  of 
public  comment,"  said  Steve  Wolff.  He 
added  that  NSF  hopes  to  issue  the  solicita- 
tion in  May  or  June  of  this  year. 

No  service  Interruption  for  users 

The  plan  has  two  aspects:  the  first  is  a 
provision  which  will  assure  that  users  will 
see  no  interruption  in  service  when  the 
current  agreement  expires.  The  second  is  a 
set  of  solicitations  for  longer-term  provision 
of  services. 


"As  an  association  of  network  and  infor- 
mation service  providers,  FARNET 
[Federation  of  American  Research  Net- 
works] has  endorsed  the  principles  of 
competition  and  choice,  especially  where  the 
market  for  these  services  is  maturing,"  said 
Laura  Breeden,  Executive  Director  of 
FARNET.  "We  are  looking  forward  to 
working  with  NSF  on  the  implementation  of 
its  plans  for  the  INREN  [Interim  National 
Research  and  Education  Network]." 

Plan  reflects  FARNET  recommendations 
This  past  November  FARNET  submitted  a 
number  of  recommendations  to  NSF 
regarding  interregional  connectivity  after 
November  1992.  The  plan  reflects  some 
aspects  of  the  FARNET  input,  as  well  as 
the  input  of  many  other  individuals,  federal 
agencies,  and  organizations  with  whom 
NSF  consulted.

The  following  is  a  new  acceptable  use  policy  for  the  NSFNET  backbone  service.  Copies  are  available  via  anonymous 
FTP  from  nis.nsf.net.  The  file  to  retrieve  is:  acceptable.use.policies/nsfnet.txt  or  nsfnet.ps  for  the  PostScript  version. 


The  NSFNET  Backbone  Service  Acceptable  Use  Policy 

GENERAL  PRINCIPLE: 

(1)  NSFNET  Backbone  services  are  provided  to  support  open  research  and    education  in  and 
among  US  research  and  instructional  institutions,  plus  research  arms  of  for-profit  firms  when  engaged  in 
open    scholarly  communication  and  research,  Use  for  other  purposes  is  not  acceptable. 
SPECIFICALLY  ACCEPTABLE  USES: 

(2)  Communication  with  foreign  researchers  and  educators  in  connection  with  research  or  Instruc- 
tion, as  long  as  any  network  that  the  foreign  user  employs  for  such  communication  provides  reciprocal 
access  to  US  researchers  and  educators. 

(3)  Communication  and  exchange  for  professional  development,  to  maintain  currency,  or  to  debate 
issues  in  a  field  or  subfield  of  knowledge. 

(4)  Use  for  disciplinary-society,  university-association,  government-advisory,  or  standards  activities  re- 
lated to  the  user's  research  and  instructional  activities. 

(5)  Use  in  applying  for  or  administering  grants  or  contracts  for  research  or  instruction,  but  not  for  other 
fundraising  or  public  relations  activities. 

(6)  Any  other  administrative  communications  or  activities  in  direct  support  of  research  and  instruc- 
tion. 

(7)  Announcements  of  new  products  or  services  for  use  in  research  or  instruction,  but  not  advertising 
of  any  kind. 

(8)  Any  traffic  originating  from  a  network  of  another  member  agency  of  the  Federal  Networking 
Council  If  the  traffic  meets  the  acceptable  use  policy  of  that  agency. 

(9)  Communication  incidental  to  otherwise  acceptable  use,  except  for  illegal  or  specifically  unac- 
ceptable use. 


UNACCEPTABLE  USES 

(10)  Use  for  for-profit  activities  (consulting  for  pay,  sales  or  administration  of  campus  stores,  sale  of 
tickets  to  sports  events,  and  so  on)  or  use  by  for-profit  institutions  unless  covered  by  the  General  Prin- 
ciple or  as  a  specifically  acceptable  use. 

(1 1)  Extensive  use  for  private  or  personal  business.  This  statement  applies  to  use  of  the  the  NSFNET 
Backbone  only.  NSF  expects  that  connecting  networks  will  formulate  their  own  use  policies.  The  NSF 
Division  of  Networking  and  Communications  Research  and  Infrastructure  will  resolve  any  questions 
about  this  Policy  or  its  interpretation.

Getting  the  "right  tool  for  the  job"  no 
longer  applies  only  to  obtaining  the 
latest  battery-powered  gizmo  from 
the  local  "Hammers  R  Us"  hardware  store. 
The  value  of  owning  the  proper  tool  holds 
true  for  the  "net  ops"  who  manage  today's 
rapidly  growing  computer  networks  as 
much  as  for  carpenters,  electricians  or  auto 
mechanics. 

Since  1988,  Merit  has  operated  a  Network 
Operations  Center  (NOC)  in  Ann  Arbor,  MI, 
for  managing  the  NSFNET.  Network 
capacity  has  expanded  more  than  700  times 
and  network  connections  have  grown  from 
170  in  July  1988  to  more  than  4,500  in 
January  1992.  New  nodes  and  links  are  now 
being  added  almost  weekly  and  data  traffic 
has  increased  from  195  million  to  over  13 
billion  packets  per  month. 


It  is  the  job  of  the  technicians  in  the  Merit 
NOC  to  monitor  this  vast  network,  open 
trouble  tickets  for  problems  that  occur,  and 
track  them  through  to  closure. 

Owing  to  the  leading-edge  nature  of  the 
NSFNET  technology,  appropriate  monitor- 
ing and  diagnostic  tools  are  generally  not 
commercially  available.  Consequently, 
Merit  Internet  engineers  often  write  software 
to  fill  the  need  for  timely  problem  detection 
and  resolution  on  the  backbone. 

Rover  is  one  of  the  primary  tools  used  by 
the  Merit  NOC  to  monitor  the  NSFNET. 
The  Rover  package  was  written  by  Bill 
Norton  of  Merit's  Network  Management 
Systems  group. 

"Bill  has  had  almost  daily  contact  with 
NOC  personnel  and  has  filled  in  as  an

operator  on  occasion.  The  unique  insight 
into  the  needs  of  the  NOC  gained  from  this 
contact  is  apparent  in  the  design  of  the  tool," 
said  John  Labbe,  NOC  assistant  manager. 
Rover  is  an  extensible  tool  that  currently 
incorporates  two  modules:  originalRover, 
including  Roverd  and  Display,  and 
discoveryRover,  which  provides  an  in-depth, 
real-time  picture  of  the  Advanced  Network 
&  Services  T3  network.  Figure  1,  at  left,  il- 
lustrates the  interactions  of  the  various 
pieces  of  Rover. 

originalRover 

originalRover  was  developed  in  1988.  It 
consists  of  two  parts,  Roverd  and  Display. 
Roverd  reads  information  from  a  configura- 
tion file  called  hostfile  that  contains  a  list  of 
network  nodes,  IP  addresses  and  associated 
tests  to  be  performed  on  each  of  them.  Ex- 
ample lines  from  hostfile  are  shown  in 
Figure  2,  below. 

If  the  test  fails,  a  problem  entry  is  added  to 
the  problem  file.  Subsequently,  if  a  test  suc- 
ceeds the  problem  entry  is  removed.  All 
problem  additions  and  deletions  are  logged. 
The  contents  of  the  problem  file  are  view- 
able on  monitors  through  the  Display 
module  of  originalRover. 

Display 

The  Display  module  of 
originalRover  allows  the 
contents  of  the  problem 
file  to  be  viewed  on  four- 
by-five-foot  monitors  in 
the  Merit  NOC  as  well  as 
on  the  NOC  Ops'  moni- 
tors. The  problem  file  is 
periodically  polled  for 
modifications  and  the  dis- 


plays are  updated  accordingly.  A  representa- 
tion of  the  text  display  is  shown  in  Figure  3 
on  the  following  page. 

Latest  Developments— discoveryRover 

During  the  past  months,  the  T3  ANSnet 
(Advanced  Network  &  Services  network) 
has  come  into  its  own  as  noted  in  the  article 
on  page  1  of  this  issue.  Rover  has  been  made 
more  robust  to  deal  with  the  new  technology 
and  the  increasing  complexity  of  the 
networks. 

Collection  mechanism 

The  initial  version  of  originalRover  would 
cycle  through  the  host  file  sequentially  and 
the  time  it  took  to  query  all  the  nodes  was 
somewhat  dependent  on  the  state  of  the 
network.  It  would  not  put  a  report  of  "node 
down"  in  the  problem  file  until  the 
reachability  test — five  successive  "pings" 
(five  retries,  one  second  apart)  had  failed. 
This,  plus  the  sequential  pattern,  allowed  for 
a  potentially  high  cycle  time  which  was 
unacceptable. 

With  discoveryRover  it  is  possible  to  ob- 
tain a  more  in-depth  picture  of  the  network 
by  supplementing  the  original  ping/ 
reachability  tests  with  Simple  Network 
Management  Protocol  (SNMP)  queries.

30-second  discovery  of  the  current 
topology 

Only  30  seconds  are  needed  for 
discoveryRover  to  determine  the  current  to- 
pology of  the  network  and  store  the  state  of 
the  nodes  and  links  in  a  network  status  file. 
This  is  accomplished  by  querying  the 
"known"  nodes  for  information  on  the  nodes 
they  know  about,  i.e.  "what  links  do  you 
have,  who  is  attached  to  them,  and  what  is 
the  state  of  the  link?"  More  specifically, 
SNMP  queries  return  information  on  node 
reachability,  link  state  information  and  in- 
formation on  Autonomous  System  (AS) 
reachability. 

Nodes  that  respond  to  the  query  are 
marked  up.  Link  state  is  determined  by  que- 
rying the  IS -IS  tables  maintained  at  each  of 
the  nodes. 

The  IS-IS  protocol  operating  over  the  links 
and  the  routers  will  mark  the  links  down  if 
they  have  not  heard  a  hello  packet  recently. 
Conversely,  if  the  router  says  the  link  is  up, 
that  means  it  has  heard  a  hello  packet  and 
the  remote  machine  is  probably  up  which  re- 
sults in  the  node  being  marked  busy — most 


likely  up  but  has  not  answered  the  SNMP 
query  yet.  Therefore,  if  SNMP  link  queries 
obtain  a  response  then  the  node  at  the  end  of 
the  link  is  assumed  to  be  functioning  and  its 
status  is  marked  up. 

This  discovery  process  is  the  mechanism 
that  obtains  the  information  stored  in  the 
Network  Status  File  which  contains  a  list  of 
objects  named  nodes  and  links.  Query  re- 
sponses may  be  displayed  as  ordinary  text  or 
through  an  X  Window-based  environment. 

X  Window-based  display 

An  X  Window-based  graphical  interface 
has  been  developed  to  aid  in  using  Rover. 
This  "front  end"  to  the  Rover  data  collector 
displays  nodes  and  links  in  a  color-key 
fashion  which  reflects  their  state  as  seen  in 
the  Network  Status  File.  As  new  node  and 
link  objects  are  discovered  in  the  network, 
the  map  is  updated  to  show  the  new  objects. 
Placement  of  nodes  on  the  display  is 
accomplished  using  the  mouse,  and  the 
map  is  automatically  saved  upon  exiting 
the  program.

Customizing 

Users  can  bind  arbitrary  actions  to  mouse 
clicks  or  key  clicks  on  nodes  or  links  dis- 
played on  the  map.  These  actions  are 
defined  in  the  user's  .Xdefaults  file.  The  ex- 
ample shown  in  Figure  4  is  a  user's 
.Xdefaults  file  which  binds  a  "mouse  button 
1  down  event"  to  opening  an  AiXterm  win- 
dow and  pinging  the  node  in  question. 


Nsfnet3*draw*XmPushButton. Translations:  #augment  \ 
<BtnlDown>:      system (  aixterm  -e  ping  $1  )  \n\ 
<Btn3Down>:      system (  aixterm  -e  telnet  $1  ) 


The  "mouse  button  3  down  event"  is  like- 
wise bound  to  opening  an  AiXterm  window 
telneted  into  the  node.  The  graphical  display 
replaces  all  instances  of  $1  with  the  IP  Ad- 
dress of  the  node  that  was  pressed. 

The  syntax  for  actions  on  links  is  similar. 
Merit  is  currently  specifying  the  above  tasks 
in  Rover's  .Xdefaults  file  by  binding  execu- 
tion of  a  shell  script  rather  than  coding  the 
actual  command  in  the  .Xdefaults.  While 
originally  done  for  readability,  experience 
has  shown  that  by  executing  a  shell  script,  a 
layer  of  abstraction  can  easily  be  added.  For 
instance,  if  there  is  a  desire  to  get  connected 
to  a  node,  the  shell  script  could  try  to  use  in- 
band  access  first,  and  if  that  failed, 
automatically  use  out-of-band  access  trans- 
parent to  the  operator. 

One  can  imagine  invoking  a  link  testing 
shell  script  with  a  mouse  or  key  click  se- 
quence that  would  perform  link  diagnosis. 
This  shell  script  might  query  either  end  of 
the  link  for  DSU  and  interface  status,  error 
counts,  or  other  defined  conditions. 


Possible  use  with  other  tools 

The  Network  Status  File  offers  another  ad- 
vantage in  that  it  can  be  used  in  other 
network  management  tools  such  as  statistics 
collections.  The  status  file  provides  a  list  of 
reachable  nodes  that  is  used  during  the  col- 
lection of  data  from  the  network.  As  new 
nodes  are  discovered  they  are  automatically 
added  to  the  SNMP  data  collection  list. 

An  additional  feature  is  the 
automatic  measuring  of  cir- 
cuit quality  by  Merit's  DSU 
circuit  monitoring  facility  as 
new  links  are  added. 

Conceivably,  this  might  permit  automatic 
diagnosis  of  problems.  Binding  execution 
of  a  shell  script  to  a  node  or  link  state  transi- 
tion would  be  one  way  of  automating 
problem  determination.  This  script  could  po- 
tentially update  the  operators'  problem  entry 
with  the  information  that  it  discovered. 
Eventually,  the  problem  might  also  be  cor- 
rected automatically.  In  that  case,  the  NOC 
would  be  informed  of  the  occurrence  and  the 
corrective  action  taken. 

Rover  is  continually  being  refined  to  stay 
abreast  of  the  current  needs  of  the  Network 
Operations  Center.  For  further  information
