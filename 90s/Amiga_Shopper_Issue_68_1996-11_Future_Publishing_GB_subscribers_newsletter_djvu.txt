Subscription Letter 



The essential magazine for Amiga enthusiasts 'r'Sgi

Issue 68 November 1996 




I am sad to say that you are now a member of a very exclusive club. With the 
market continuing to deteriorate, Amiga Shopper will no longer be able to take 
new subscriptions and so, as your subscription runs out, you will not be able 
to renew it. This is because there is little chance of another 1 2 issues of your 
favourite mag. 

We shall be continuing tor as long as possible and you will continue to get 
your mag until your subscription ends or we do, whichever is the former. You 
will then have the opportunity to take up a subscription with our sister magazine, Amiga Format. 
If your subscription is coming to an end, then don't despair. You can still set a regular order 
for Amiga Shopper at your newsagents and that will guarantee that you don't miss out on a 
single issue. 

On a happier note, we are still around so let's not dwell too much on the future, but on the 
present which is looking pretty good for serious users. There has been no let up in new releases 
of both hardware and software and you can read the definitive reviews, as usual, in the main 
magazine. The Coverdisk is jammed with some top quality stuff, but there wasn't room for the 
usual smaller utilities so you lucky subscribers have this month's pick on your exclusive disk. 
Turn over for details of the disks contents and remember, chin up.

Subscribers 



David Taylor introduces this month's Subscribers disk which 
has the very best in new software from the Amiga PD. 




This is a rendering 
of the Lost object. 
The picture is on 
the Subs disk itself 
in the Picture 
directory and the 
object is in the 
third Subs Zone.

This month's disk has got some real 
treats in store for you. There's a new 
version of SysSpeed, the system 
tester and of LCD Daemon the software for 
the LCD hardware project which we ran in 
AS64 and which proved so popular. Then 
there's a 3D object for Imagine and on the 
disk itself an example rendering of it in 
JPEG form and, to top it all off, another six 
useful utilities. 

SysSpeed 

Other speed testers which are used for 
measuring the capabilities of your system 
can be very incorrect. Their results are 
either spurious or not really very revealing 
about the system. SysSpeed reckons to 
change ail this and allows you to create 
complete modules of tests so that you can 
compare machines. In addition to doing 
standard CPU rating tests, there are various 
optional tests based on real software so 



that, assuming you have the programs, you 
can get results from graphics packages and 
archivers to see how well your machine 
operates under real situations. 

The testing doesn't stop with the CPU 
and can be used to check all of the system 
including disk speeds. 

TinyPlayer 

This is a very small and compact module 
player which can pi ay a variety of file 
formats including the brand new OctaMED 
Soundstudio format. It handles Med files, 
files packed with PowerPacker, files 
crunched with XPK and much more. 

Clip History 

The clipboard is a useful facility that allows 
you to copy and paste text around an 
application. Whenever you copy a piece of 
text in an application it is placed as a 
temporary item in the clipboard for you to 




use. However, we always want more and 
complain that there is only a single 
clipboard and that, while there is no 
technical reason against it, we can normally 
only hold one item in memory. Also a item 
copied to the clipboard in one application is 
not necessarily available to be pasted in 
another. 

Clip History solves both of these 
problems and gives you an interface which 
can be brought up with a hotkey so that you 
can choose which item you want to paste. 
It expands a useful feature into an 
invaluable one. 

Ultra Pay Advice 

This application is a brand new version of 
Pay Advice and allows you to enter alt your 
pay details every month so you can keep 
track of them and ensure that you are not 
paying too much tax and that you have 
been paid the correct amount. It is 
extremely easy to use and you should be 
able to get your pay in order very quickly. 

XFD 

This package requires installing and it 
allows you to unpack any packed file using 
just one single command. Normally you 
would have to know exactly what form of 
file you were working with and have the 
appropriate unpacker to be able to do any 
work on it. Now all you need is this package 
with its set of custom libraries and use the 
xfd decrunch command (there are also 
other commands for other functions 
included). You select the filename and 
destination and it will be automatically 
unpacked. Wildcards are accepted so you 



can scan the entire directory. For example, 
Xfddecrunch dfO;#? Ram; will try every file 
on dfO: and unpack any packed ones to 
ram:. This is especially useful for packed 
data files or documents that you want to 
work with but were unable to load. 

LCD Daemon 

In AS64 we ran a special DIY hardware 
project that showed you how to create a 
liquid crystal display that your Amiga could 
control and use to display pertinent 
information that may not be able to be 
displayed on the screen. This is the latest 
release of the software and if you don't 
have issue 64, don't worry because the 
instructions for building it are included in 
the package. 

And the rest... 

Also included on the disk are a set of 
macros for Final Writer a new object for 
Imagine users, called Lost and created by T 
Coleman, and a utility called CyberMap 
which CyberStorm owners can use to 
speed up the performance of their cards. ■ 



Installation 



To install your Subscribers disk, you can 
boot it; but you'll have to have your main 
Coverdlsks at hand because the 
Subscriber's disk needs a few files from 
them. If you have a hard drive, you can 
install everything from the three disks by 
loading Workbench and using the script 
on the first Coverdisk. Remember that 
after installing the disks, you may still 
need to install individual programs from 
their drawers.
