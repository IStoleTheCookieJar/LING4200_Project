AMENDMENT  TO  OIL,  GAS  AND  MINERAL  LEASE 


State:  Texas 

County:  Tarrant 

Lessor:  Richard  Graves  and  wife,  Nancy  B.  Graves 

Lessee:  XTO  Energy  Inc. 

Effective  Date:  September  12, 2007 

Lessee,  named  above,  is  the  present  owner  of  an  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease  (the 
"Lease"),  dated  September  12,  2007,  from  Lessor,  named  above,  to  Grand  Energy,  Inc.,  and 
recorded  as  Tarrant  County  Clerk's  Document  No.  D207365980  of  the  Official  Public  Records 
of  the  county  and  state  named  above. 

At  the  time  the  Lease  was  entered  into,  the  description  of  the  lands  contained  in  the  Lease 
was  believed  by  Lessor  and  Lessee  to  cover,  and  was  intended  by  them  to  cover,  certain  lands 
owned  by  Lessor. 

Since  the  execution  and  delivery  of  the  Lease,  it  has  been  discovered  that  the  description 
of  lands  contained  in  the  Lease  does  not  adequately  describe  the  lands  Lessor  intended  to  lease  to 
Lessee.  Lessor  and  Lessee  desire  to  amend  and  correct  the  description  of  lands  contained  in  the 
Lease  to  accurately  identify  the  lands  to  be  covered  by  the  Lease. 

For  adequate  consideration,  and  the  further  consideration  of  the  obligations  and 
agreements  contained  in  the  Lease,  Lessor,  named  above,  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  the 
Lease  shall  cover,  and  the  Lease  is  hereby  amended,  so  that  it  now  covers  the  following  lands  in 
the  county  and  state  named  above: 

0.81  acres  of  land,  more  or  less,  located  in  the  M.  E.  P.  & 
P.  R.  R.  Co.  Survey,  A-1141,  Tarrant  County,  Texas  and 
being  the  same  land  more  particularly  described  in  that 
certain  Warranty  Deed  dated  August  29,  2002,  from 
Frances  Harman  to  Richard  Graves  et  ux,  recorded  at 
Document  No.  D204006395,  Real  Property  Records, 
Tarrant  County,  Texas. 

Lessor  ratifies,  adopts,  and  confirms  the  Lease  extends  the  Lease  to  cover  the  lands 
described  in  this  Amendment  as  if  the  description  of  lands  set  out  above  had  been  originally 
included  in  the  Lease.  Lessor  grants,  leases,  and  lets  to  Lessee,  its  successors  and  assigns,  the 
lands  described  in  this  Amendment  for  the  purposes  and  upon  the  terms,  conditions,  and 
provisions  contained  in  the  Lease. 


This  Amendment  shall  be  binding  for  all  purposes  on  Lessor  and  Lessor's  successors, 
heirs  and  assigns. 

This  Amendment  is  signed  by  Lessor  as  of  the  date  of  the  acknowledgment  of  their 
signatures  below,  but  is  effective  for  all  purposes  as  of  the  Effective  Date  stated  above.
