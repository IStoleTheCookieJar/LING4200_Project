Montana's  highways  will  be 
better  maintained  and  some 
might  become  scenic  byways  if 
Montana's  55th  Legislature 
approves  legislation  supported 
by  the  Montana  Department  of 
Transportation  (MDT).

Maintenance  Issues.  Scenic  Byways  Top 
MDT  Legislative  Agenda 


Improved  Highway  Maintenance 

The  maintenance  of  Montana's  major 
highways  is  critical  to  Montana's 
economic  health  and  the  safety  of 
residents  and  nonresidents  who  drive 
these  highways.  For  example,  over  8 
million  out-of-state  visitors  enter 
Montana  each  year  by  highway.  These 
visitors  contribute  over  $1  billion  to  the 
State's  economy.  These  highways  also 
carry  Montana's  agricultural  products 
to  rail  lines  and  manufactured  goods 
and  food  to  Montana's  communities. 

MDT  is  pursuing  two  legislative 
initiatives  that  will  help  insure  these 
highways  continue  to  meet  these 
critical  needs  in  the  future. 

Additional  Maintenance  Positions 


Since  1980,  MDT  has  lost  115  full-time 
equivalent  (FTE)  positions  from  it's 
Maintenance  Program.  Of  these 
reductions,  76  of  them  came  during  the 
1995  legislative  session  when  MDT 
was  asked  to  reduce  overall  FTE  levels 
by  five  percent.  During  the  same 
period,  the  department  has  added  more 
than  1700  lane  miles  of  maintenance 
responsibility.    This  means  that  each 


maintenance  employee  is  now  respon- 
sible for  approximately  eight  more  miles 
of  highway  than  an  employee  in  1980. 
Although  MDT's  Maintenance  employ- 
ees "work  smarter"  than  they  did  in  1980, 
maintaining  current  level  winter  mainte- 
nance is  a  constant  challenge.  In  fact,  for 
FY96  the  only  way  to  maintain  at  current 
levels  was  by  overrunning  our  Mainte- 
nance Program  personal  services  budget. 
A  similar  overrun  is  projected  for  FY97. 

To  address  this  problem,  MDT  is  seeking 
approval  from  the  Legislature  to  restore 
48  of  the  Maintenance  FTE' s  lost  over  the 
last  16  years.  These  positions  would  be 
filled  throughout  Montana  to  insure  each 
area  maintains  the  current  level  of 
highway  maintenance.

MDTs  Guide  to  Public  Involvement 
Now  Available 


The  "Draft  Public  Involvement  Process  Handbook" 
was  distributed  for  public  review  and  comment  in  Au- 
gust and  September.  We  received  over  200  requests 
from  readers  who  received  notification  via  postcards, 
newspaper  ads  and  MDT' s  Internet  Homepage.  More 
than  14%  of  the  requests  came  via  the  Internet. 


In  response  to  questions  and  suggestions,  the  revised  publication  in- 
cludes more  project  specific  information.  The  name  was  changed  to 
avoid  confusion  with  another  MDT  publication  which  provides  guid- 
ance to  department  employees  responsible  for  developing  public  involve- 
ment plans  for  highway  projects.  Other  changes  include  improved  graph- 
ics and  more  information  on  how  to  contact  key  MDT  offices. 

Thanks  to  everyone  that  provided  comments  and  suggestions!

Why  was  MDrs  First  Annual  Transportation 
Planning  Conference  Cancelled? 

Although  more  than  700  people  were  notified  via  postcards  and  fly- 
ers of  this  Planning-oriented  conference*  only  1 4  registrants  had  con- 
firmed by  the  registration  deadline.  The  goal  of  this  conference  was 
to  provide  our  customers  an  opportunity  to  learn  more  about  many 
of  the  programs  the  division  is  involved  in.  and  give  participants  a 
chance  to  ask  questions,  share  their  concerns,  and  discuss  ways  we 
can  improve  the  way  we  manage  these  programs. 

The  division  felt  the  cost  and  time  involved  to  proceed  with  the  con- 
ference would  far  outweigh  the  benefit  to  the  few  people  that  regis- 
tered. Therefore  the  decision  was  made  to  cancel. 

We  are  now  soliciting  comments  from  you  - 
OUR  PUBLIC  on  what  we  can  do  to  better  inform 
you.  Call  our  toll  free  line  at  1-800-714-7296  with 
your  thoughts  and  comments.

Passenger  Assistance 
Classes  Given  Across 
State 

John  Robinson,  Training  and  Develop- 
ment Specialist  in  MDT's  Transit  Sec- 
tion, conducted  nine  "Passenger  Service 
and  Safety"  workshops  during  1996. 

More  than  100  transit  drivers  across  the 
state  attended  courses  this  year.  The 
training  focused  on  the  proper  handling 
of  the  physically  disabled  passenger 
who  must  use  walkers,  canes,  crutches, 
or  wheelchairs.  "Hands  on"  training 
includes  everything  from  assisting  the 
visually  impaired  to  proper  hydraulic 
wheelchair  lift  operating  procedures. 

Upon  completion  of  the  course,  partici- 
pants must  pass  a  test  with  90%  accu- 
racy before  they  receive  a  diploma  and 
become  fully  certified  in  Passenger  Ser- 
vice and  Safety.

Great  Falls  Transit 
Driver  Competes  at 
National  Bus  Roadeo 

Dick  Dahlen  of  Great  Falls  Transit 
competed  in  the  35-foot  bus  class 
October  8  in  Anaheim,  California  af- 
ter winning  the  Montana  full-size  bus 
class. 

He  placed  26th  out  of  46  drivers  en- 
tered in  the  1996  American  Public 
Transportation  Association  Interna- 
tional Bus  Operators  Roadeo.  The 
roadeo  was  a  tremendous  experi- 
ence." Dahlen  said.  "It  was  a  great 
honor  to  represent  Montana  and  Great 
Falls  Transit." 

Congratulations  Dick!

Did  You  Know  Anyone  Can  Nominate  a  Project? 

be  years  before  it  is  let  to  contract. 


Most  people  don't  realize  anyone  can 
submit  a  highway  project  nomination. 
The  general  perception  is  only  influ- 
ential people  or  highway  officials  can 
nominate  a  project.  The  fact  is  -  any- 
one can  nominate  a  project  at  any 
time  during  the  year.  These  project 
nominations  can  be  for  any  of 
Montana's  highway  systems  as  well 
as  for  reconstruction,  resurfacing, 
bridge  rehabilitation  or  replacement, 
safety  improvements,  or  any  other 
aspect  of  Montana's  transportation 
system. 

Generally,  projects  submitted  by  the 
public  have  already  been  identified 
by  MDT  personnel  as  needed 
projects,  but  not  always.  MDT  is  al- 
ways willing  to  accept  input  from  the 
public.  Additionally,  we  encourage 
anyone  to  call  to  find  out  if  a  project 
has  already  been  identified  and  its 
tentative  contract  date.  Due  to  fund- 
ing constraints,  even  though  a  project 
has  been  put  into  the  program,  it  could 


Upon  receiving  suggestions  for  high- 
way projects,  we  acknowledge  re- 
ceipt with  a  letter.  Next,  MDT  staff 
will  see  if  it' s  identified  in  the  three- 
year  Statewide  Transportation  Im- 
provement Program  (STIP),  or  the 
long-term  tentative  construction  pro- 
gram. If  the  nominated  project  is  not 
in  the  program,  it  may  be  included  in 
the  next  draft  version  of  the  STIP 
which  is  presented  for  public  com- 
ment in  June  of  each  year.  Finally,  if 
the  proposed  project  receives  favor- 
able public  comment,  meets  the  re- 
quirements of  state  and  federal  regu- 
lations, and  receives  approval  from 
the  Montana  Transportation  Commis- 
sion, the  project  will  enter  the  prelimi- 
nary engineering  phase  of  develop- 
ment.

Missoula-Ravalli  TMA 
Presents  Mid-Year  Report 

The  Missoula-Ravalli  Transportation 
Management  Association  presented  a 
mid-year  report  to  its  advisory  board 
and  MDT  staff  on  October  30.  MR 
TMA  is  a  one-year  MDT-funded  pi- 
lot project  to  implement  transportation 
demand  management  (TDM)  strate- 
gies in  Missoula  and  Ravalli  Counties. 

Executive  Director  Noel  Larrivee  re- 
ported on  the  status  of  the  goals  and 
objectives,  noting  the  success  in  gar- 
nering support  in  Missoula  and 
throughout  the  Bitterroot  Valley. 
Larrivee  also  reported  the  first  Park 
and  Ride  lot  in  Montana  has  been  es- 
tablished in  Hamilton.  He  then  pre- 
sented three  budget  plans  to  the  board 
for  the  continuation  of  MR  TMA  in 
1997-1998.

Montana's 


How  Fast  Should  You  Drive? 

In  Montana  there  are  two  types  of 
speed  limits: 


Statutory  Speed  Limits 

Under  legislative  control  defined  by  Montana  statutes. 

♦  Safe  and  prudent 

♦  Daytime  speed  limits  for  trucks 

♦  Nighttime  speed  limits  for  all  vehicles 

♦  Limits  for  urban  districts 

♦  Limits  for  survey  crew  work  projects 

Special  Speed  Limits  or  Speed  Zones 
Are  based  on  recommendations  of  traffic  engineering  pro- 
fessionals on  specified  section  of  roadway. 

♦  School  speed  zones 

♦  Senior  citizen  centers 

♦  Roadways  where  the  adjacent  environment  is 
Transitioning  between  rural  and  urban 

♦  Temporary  work  zones 

♦  Segments  where  the  combination  of  roadway 
design  features  and  intensity  of  adjacent 
development  tend  to  cause  the  traffic  stream 
to  travel  at  other  than  statutory  limits. 

The  intent  of  speed  zones  is  to  influence  as  many  drivers 
as  possible  to  operate  at  or  near  the  same  speed,  thus 
reducing  conflicts  created  by  wide  differentials  in 
operating  speeds.  These  conflicts,  and  the  resultant 
accidents,  are  substantially  less  when  the  majority  of 
vehicles  are  traveling  the  same  speed. 

There  is  a  common  misconception  that  posting  lower  speed 
zonesreduces  the  speed  of  vehicles.  This  is  not  true.  An 
article  titled  "Traffic  Engineering  Myths  and  Realities" 
in  the  January,  1990  issue  of  Public  Works  Magazine  con- 
firms this.  The  section  on  speed  zones  tells  us  that:  "One 
of  the  most  prevalent  myths  around  is  that  motorists  will 
adjust  their  speed  in  response  to  the  numbers  posted  on 
speed  limit  signs  regardless  of  roadway  and  traffic  condi- 
tions. Before-and-after  studies  consistently  demonstrate 
that  there  are  no  significant  changes  in  traffic  speeds  fol- 
lowing the  posting  of  new  or  revised  speed  limits." 


The  article  continues,  "Furthermore, 
no  published  research  findings  have 
established  any  direct  relationship 
between  posted  speed  limits  and  ac- 
cident frequency,..." 


Studies 

show  speed 

limit  signs 

have  little 

or  no  effect 

on  the 

speed  of 

traffic. 


Regulatory  speed  limit  signs  should  identify 
the  maximum  speed  limit,  enabling  law  en- 
forcement to  target  those  who  are  driving 
outside  the  normal  pace  of  traffic. 

Another  common  misconception  about  speed 
zones  is  lower  speed  zones  decrease  accidents. 
In  fact,  speed  zones  which  are  set  arbitrarily 
low  are  often  less  safe  than  speed  zones  which  have  been 
recommended  based  on  a  thorough  traffic  and  engineer- 
ing study  of  the  roadway  and  its  environment.  Setting 
speed  zones  below  the  normal  traffic  pace  can  result  in  a 

wider  range  of  traffic 
speeds  on  the  roadway, 
and  potentially  more 
hazardous  conditions. 

The  use  of  engineering 
and  design  tools  is  the 
best  way  to  target  and  re- 
duce accident  trends. 
These  tools  include 
modified  roadway  align- 
ment, intersection  de- 
sign, traffic  signals, 
pavement  markings,  and 
signage.  Properly  ap- 
plied, these  tools  result 
in  a  more  uniform  pace, 
reduced  conflicts,  and 
fewer  accidents. 


Appropriate  speed 

zones  are  aids  to 

law  enforcement  to 

target  the  smaller 

number  of  high  risk 

motorists  in  the 

traffic  stream  who 

drive  at  a  speed 

other  than  that 

deemed  prudent  by 

the  majority  of  the 

drivers.

Speed  Zones 


Procedures  for  Revising  Speed  Zones 
On  MDT  Highways 

1 .  MDT  encourages  any  requests  for  changes  in  a 
speed  limit  to  be  submitted  to  the  department 
by  local  governments  or  state  agencies.  If  a  lo- 
cal individual  submits  a  request,  MDT  will  con- 
tact the  appropriate  local  governing  authority 
for  approval. 

2.  Following  receipt  of  a  request,  MDT  sends  a 
letter  to  the  requestor  explaining  the  specific 
procedures.  MDT  staff  then  meets  with  the  lo- 
cal government  body  to  explain  the  law,  depart- 
ment and  Montana  Transportation  Commission 
responsibilities,  and  the  traffic  and  engineering 
study  used  to  develop  recommendations. 

3.  The  local  government  body  has  30  days  after 
the  meeting  to  decide  whether  to  sign  a  letter 
saying  the  officials  want  the  study  to  continue. 

4.  If  the  local  government  body  gives  its  approval, 
traffic  engineers  conduct  a  traffic  and  engineer- 
ing study  as  required  by  law  and  then  prepares 
recommendations  for  the  local  government. 
Recommendations  are  based  on  several  factors, 
including  the  85th  percentile  speed  and  pace. 

The  pace  is  a  10  MPH  range  of  speed  contain- 
ing the  largest  proportion  of  the  traffic  stream. 
Both  radar  and  automated  counters  are  used  to 
measure  vehicular  speeds  in  both  directions.  En- 
gineers review  the  distribution  of  speed  within 
the  traffic  stream  to  determine  the  speed  most 
drivers  are  driving.  The  greater  the  percentage 
of  vehicles  in  the  pace,  the  fewer  conflicts  the 
driver  has  to  deal  with  and  the  safer  the  road- 
way. Other  factors  considered  are  road  surface 
and  condition,  curves  and  hazards,  roadside  de- 
velopment, such  as  business  and  advertising 
signs  -  sometimes  called  roadside  friction,  park- 
ing and  pedestrian  activity,  and  accident  records 
for  the  area. 


Since  motorists  take  most  of  these  things  into 
account  when  determining  their  speed,  the  best 
measurement  for  speed  zone  setting  is  still  the 
speed  most  drivers  are  driving.  This  is  referred 
to  as  the  85th  percentile  and  is  based  on  the 
princilple  that  85  percent  of  the  drivers  are  safe 
and  prudent  and  adjust  their  speed  to  the  con- 
ditions regardless  of  the  posted  limit.  Studies 
have  also  shown  motorists  driving  at  or  right 
below  the  85th  percentile  speed  are  the  most 
alert  and  least  likely  to  involved  in  an  accident. 

MDT  staff  provides  the  study  results  to  the  lo- 
cal government  within  30  days  of  the  study 
completion. 

The  local  government  has  60  days  after  receiv- 
ing the  results  to  comment.  A  copy  of  the  re- 
sults is  also  sent  to  local  law  enforcement  offi- 
cials and  the  Montana  Highway  Patrol. 

At  the  end  of  60  days  the  results  and  the 
department's  recommendation  are  presented  to 
the  Montana  Transportation  Commission  at  its 
next  regular  meeting.  The  local  government 
receives  written  notification  of  recommenda- 
tions and  is  also  informed  of  the  Commission 
meeting  date.  The  local  government  is  advised 
of  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  the  Com- 
mission. 

If  the  Transportation  Commission  approves  the 
change,  MDT  personnel  make  the  necessary 
signing  changes.

Montana's  White  Crosses 
A  Brief  History 


For  43  years,  white  crosses  have 
marked  the  scenes  of  fatal  traf- 
fic accidents  along  the  highways 
of  Montana.  These  crosses  re- 
mind passing  motorists  of  the 
dangers  of  the  roads,  as  well  as 
the  lives  which  have  been  lost 
on  the  highways. 


The  white  cross  program  began  after 
six  lives  were  lost  in  the  Missoula  area 
over  the  Labor  Day  Holiday  in  1952. 
Floyd  Eaheart,  a  member  of  the 
American  Legion  in  Missoula,  felt  the 
crosses  would  act  as  a  reminder  to  the 
hazards  of  the  roads. 

After  being  approved  by  the  Montana 
Highway  Commission  in  January  of 
1953,  other  American  Legion  posts 
around  the  state  took  up  the  cause  and 
had  placed  over  2000  crosses  by  1965 
(This  represents  a  cemetery  of  over 
five  acres). 

Most  of  the  122  American  Legion 
posts  in  Montana  have  been  assigned 
an  area  in  which  they  are  responsible 
for  placing  and  maintaining  the  white 
crosses. 


Each  post  assembles  its  own  crosses 
by  the  standards  set  by  the  American 
Legion,  and  places  them  as  close  to 
the  exact  scene  of  the  fatal  accident 
as  possible. 


The  American  Legion's  White 
Crosses  can  be  found  on  state  high- 
ways, secondary  roads,  city  streets, 
and  in  abiding  by  federal  law,  far  off 
the  interstate  highway. 

Even  though  the  signs  are  self-ex- 
planatory to  Montanans  who  have 
lived  around  them  for  generations,  the 
American  Legion  has  placed  signs  ex- 
plaining the  program  at  several  en- 
trances to  the  state.  For  example,  the 
sign  near  Libby  says  "Each  white 
cross  represents  a  highway  fatality, 
please  drive  carefully  -  American  Le- 
gion Post  #97  Libby". 

The  American  Legion  has  experi- 
enced few  difficulties  with  the  pro- 
gram, but  on  rare  occasions,  the  white 
crosses  have  been  torn  down  by  griev- 
ing families. 


Quite  often,  families  place  wreaths  and 
other  decorations  on  the  crosses,  which 
many  times  are  considered  a  memorial 
to  a  loved  one  lost  in  an  accident.

Additional  Preventive  Maintenance 
Funding 


MDT  is  also  seeking  approval  from 
the  Legislature  to  redirect  $1  million 
in  current  level  funding  to  establish  a 
proactive  preventive  maintenance 
program  on  Montana's  most  impor- 
tant highways. 

Montana's  highway  system  has  an 
estimated  replacement  value  in  the 
billions  of  dollars.  As  in  the  case  of 
any  product,  highways  cannot  be 
made  to  last  forever.  Roadways 
deteriorate  and  disintegrate  at  an 
accelerated  rate  unless  they  are 
properly  and  consistently  maintained. 
While  the  department  has  a  substan- 
tial program  designed  to  maintain  our 
highway  infrastructure,  it's  largely  a 
"reactive  maintenance"  program.  The 
system  needs  are  so  great  compared  to 
the  limited  resources,  MDT  is  forced 
to  apply  the  available  resources  to 
those  areas  with  the  worst  problems. 

This  funding  request  will  allow  the 
department  to  begin  moving  to  a 
mode  of  preventive  rather  than 
reactive  maintenance.  MDT  will  use 
these  funds   on  cost-effective  thin

overlay,  chip  seal,  and  crack  sealing 
projects.  This  minor  and  inexpensive 
investment  will  pay  off  over  time  by 
delaying  the  need  for  expensive 
overlay  and  reconstruction  projects, 
and  increasing  the  life  span  of  our 
highways. 


Montana  Scenic/Historic 
Byway  Program 

Montana  has  many  roads 

with  noteworthy  scenic 

and  historic  features  that 

would  be  of  interest  to 

out-of-state    visitors. 

However,  unlike  most 

states,  Montana  has  never  developed 

a  program  that  identifies  and  promotes 

these  routes  to  benefit  Montana's 

communities. 

Proposals  for  a  Montana  scenic  by- 
way program  have  come  up  often  in 
the  last  30  years,  but  have  never  re- 
sulted in  the  development  of  a  pro- 
gram. MDT  finally  addressed  this 
issue  in  a  comprehensive  manner  in 
the  1994  Scenic  Byway  Feasibility 
Study.  The  Study  concluded  a  pro- 
gram which  recognized  noteworthy 
routes  and  encouraged  visitors  to  ex- 
tend their  visits  would  be  beneficial 
to  Montana's  communities.  MDT  is 
therefore  asking  the  55th  Legislature 
for  the  authority  to  develop  a  Mon- 
tana Scenic/Historic  Byway  Program. 

The  Feasibility  Study  also  determined 
that  Montana  would  benefit  most 
from  a  "two-tiered"  scenic  and  his- 
toric byway  program  that  includes 
less-developed  "backcountry"  routes 


as  well  as  traditional  major  highways. 
This  type  of  program,  which  has  been 
very  successful  in  Utah,  would  allow 
all  areas  of  Montana  to  participate. 

Scenic  and  Historic  Byway  designa- 
tion wouldn't  provide  any  additional 
funding  for  reconstruction  or  mainte- 
nance.   However,  enhancements  to 
these  routes,  such  as  interpretive  signs 
and  guides,  bike  and  pedestrian 
facilities,  and  scenic  puUouts, 
would  be  eligible  for  funding 
under  Montana's  Community 
^^^Bj  Transportation  Enhancement 
V     Program. 

Development  of  a  Montana  program 
would  also  allow  Montana's  best 
routes  to  be  eligible  for  nomination 
for  designation  as  Ail-American 
Roads  or  National  Scenic  Byways 
through  a  Federal  program  designed 
to  promote  routes  nationally  and  in- 
ternationally.
