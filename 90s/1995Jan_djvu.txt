appy New Year to you all! 
Do you, like me, have all 
sorts of resolutions you’ve 
already broken? No 
matter....forget the guilt and simply 
resolve now to have fun and paint 
something YOU want to paint 
(sometimes the hardest 


resolution). In colors that make 
YOU feel good. Mix and splash and 
fool around. And when you need a 
break from feeling so creative, sit 
down with a cup of something and 
catch up on the latest GSWS news. 
We've lots of it.

Butler and Dave Dewey. Receiving 
will be September 9th, the reception 
October 15. The show runs until 
November 26th. Pick-up is Nov. 26

to plan ahead. 


Views of 
Natu re is the title of the 


show which will be held July 29— 
September 1 at the Stony Brook 
Gallery, 31 Titus Mill Road, in Pen-

pieces will be juried into a show

selected by the artists. Commission 
will be 30%. The paintings are shown 
at the artist’s risk since the 
Watershed Association doesn’t carry 
art insurance, but the Gallery is 
manned. and good care is taken. 
We'll send out forms in mid-April. 
Our chairman for this show is Stan 
Kephart.

The Chalfonte Hotel in Cape May was

Oct.8. Her paintings have been juried 
into the Perkins Center for the Arts 
Members & Faculty Exhibit, the 
GSWS juried show (the Cotswold

Heritage Commission Annual, and 
the Jane Law Long Beach Island

County.She served as chairwoman of

KATHY L. WOTRING received notifi-

able Mention in the 61st Inter- 
national (juried) Exhibition of the

The show was Nov. 6 to Nov. 27. 





President’s Message, continued 


with the purchased pictures 
ranging in price from $15. to $750. 
About 300 people attended the sale 
this year; most walked out with 
something. Framed and unframed 
work sold about equally well. 
Approximately $19,000 worth of 
paintings were sold giving GSWS 
$2,495. after expenses. We are one 
of the few art organizations with 
associate membership to provide a 


showing-selling opportunity for 
associates. 

In October, the GSWS was asked 
to participate in a day featuring the 
arts at Quakerbridge Mall. We set up 
a small display of paintings by local 
GSWS artists on a screen lent by 
Harriet Kaftanic. Using the GSWS 
mirror, Richard Kaiser and Robert 
Heyer demonstrated watercolor 
landscapes to fascinated audiences. 





Both the display and 
demonstrations were much 
admired and two paintings were 
sold. 

The work of Board members has 
been helped by the secretarial 
services of Linda Goldberg who 
works at a very reasonable hourly 
rate assisting with typing, mailing, 
and maintaining our computer lists.
