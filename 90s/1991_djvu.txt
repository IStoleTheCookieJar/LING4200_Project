WHAT A WAY TO 
START THE DAY 


BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! “My 
clock wakes me up, but my mother 
has to get me up,”’ 
LaTonya Cullers. Waking up for 
school is not the easiest thing to do, 
but some students and teachers woke 
up at the crack of dawn to participate 
in early morning school activities. 
The lunchroom served breakfast for 
the first time this year. A few devoted 
debaters worked before school with 
Mr. Watford, who is always early for 
work “because I get up at 3:00 in the 
morning after only five or six hours of 
sleep!” After an hour and twenty 
minute drive, Mr. Orr was usually the 
first teacher to pull into the faculty 
parking lot at 7:15 A.M. He must be 
at school early to teach the Great 
Books class that began this year. 
Fourteen students joined Mr. Orr 
every morning at 7:30 to discuss great 
works of literature. 


alarm 


explained 


“I get up at 3:00 every 
morning.” 
— Mr. Watford 


Also a large group of students felt 
that prayer is the most important way 
to start the day. From 7:45 to 8:15 
they joined together in the audito- 
rium. 

People that rode the “great yellow 
tube” did not have much choice what 
time they got to school. Since the 
staff enforced the rule about staying 
outside until 8:15, these students 
spent their extra morning time so- 
cializing or finishing homework. 

The rest of the student body, who 
got to school as late as they could, 
zoomed along the winding road to 
the parking lot at 8:20. As the home- 
room bell rang they slid into their 
seat.

way to start the day is to be late for 
school. Not arriving on time for 
homeroom can be hazardous to a 
person’s whole day! Just think of all 
the extra steps a student has to go 
through if he does not quite make it 


by the tardy bell... 
m Go to Mr. Carter’s office m Stand 


in a long line for a late slip = Think of 
good excuse for not being there on 
time m Carry late slip to homeroom 
teacher to sign (This is usually on the 
other side of school.) m Walk back to 
other building for first period (By this 
time the student is usually ten min- 
utes late for class.) m Show slip to the 
teacher m» Remember to have every 
teacher for the next five periods sign 
the now very wrinkled late slip. 

If a student makes a habit of going 
through these steps, after three times 
he would be penalized with one hour 
of detention.

Bottom: A volunteer guides a reg-

Campaign posters littered the halls 
candidates drew last-minute buttons and 
made speeches to passing students in the 
hall. Candidates ran for President, Vice 
President, Secretary, and Treasurer for each 
class. Together Mrs. Hubbard and the Lead 
ership Peach program created a realistic at 
mosphere with the same voting machines 
and registration forms used in Peach County 
Elections. Mrs. Hubbard supervised the 
project, and decided that this would be an 
excellent chance for students to experience 
voting as adults 

Registrars were called from each home 
room to pass out registration forms make 
sure of completion, and alphabetize. Those 
who did not fill out forms in advance were 
given a second chance the day of the voting 
Neal David was the chief registrar. “It was a 
learning experience for everyone,” he said, 
‘and was also fun! 


Homerooms were called out of class, be 
ginning with the Seniors, to come down to 
the auditorium and vote. As homerooms 
arrived, Mrs. Hubbard passed out sheets 
that listed all the candidates running. It also 
had questions on modern issues, like longer 
school years, and asked who we would se 
lect for governor. There were two machines 
and several volunteers who helped show 
the students how to operate the machines 

The process lasted longer than expected 
and only Seniors, Juniors, and some Soph 
omores were allowed to vote on the ma- 
chines, while Freshmen and the rest of the 
Sophomores used ballots to vote. “It was 
disappointing,” said Jessie Pierce, a fresh 
man, “but there is always next year!”

“Our Homeconting Queestfor 1990-91, Miss Hope Bickley!”’ Cheers rang out over the ium as the beaming queen was crowned. 
Weeks before, girls begafi#preparing for this very special half-time. It all starte y filling out an application. But after passing 
the grade require s, thie girls began the most difficult part of running for urt: campaigning, stocking up on candy ae 
board, the competitors fill rhe halls with banners bearing catchy phrases. Bart Simpson and familiar sayings encouraged student® to cast 


their vote. Everyone was eage®ro get a campaign sticker with candy attached and share in the excitement of voting day. The girls waited 
impatiently for the sixth peri@@ announcement that revealed the names of the court. The Fresh class elected Amy Culpepper.and Mitzi 
Hamlin. Sophomores voted di Brandi Reddick and LaTondra Tennyson. T Wright and Ashley Parks represented the juniots. Senior 
Trojanettes were Hope Bickley, La@ha Fluellen, Tami Shealy, and NicolelGtramge. 

These lucky girls movedjon to tM fun of finding a dress for Homecomffig¢might and the excitement of riding in the Homecoming 


Parade. They were also treat@d to a special lunch on Homecoming 
But the tense moments wéfe not over for the Senior representatives had more campaigning ahead and after voting for the queen, 
hey had three more weeks of waiting. Then finally, the night arrived. Ten beauties strolled across the field with their proud escorts and 
bok their place on the court. Everyone waited excitedly as last year’s queen, Kelli Kennedy, crowné@ the new Trojanette. ‘I couldn't 
elieve it when I saw Kelli walking over to me and heard my name over the intercom. It was so special, I'll never forget it.”’

ALL THE TRIMMINGS 


From dawn to dark, it was Homecoming all day long. And 
even before that, preparations for the big day were being 
made. Weeks in advance classes and clubs built and stuffed 
their floats. Class representatives jingled cans, collecting mon- 
ey for Spirit Ribbons. Homerooms decorated their doors and 
made helmets for their teachers to wear. 

In homeroom, teachers counted the number of students 
who dressed up for Tacky Day, Black and Gold, and Spirit and 
Tie Day. Mrs. Washington’s and Mrs. Branch’s homerooms 
both had 100% participation in the Black and Gold Contest. 

Then the judging began. Homeroom door winners were 
Mrs. Allgood, Mrs. Byas, and Mrs. Holly. For the second year 
in a row, Mrs. Branch’s homeroom won the helmet contest. 

Juniors stole the show at the Pep Rally, winning the Relay 
Race, the Spirit Ribbon Contest, and the Spirit Stick Contest. 

Following the presentation of the Homecoming Court, 
cheerleaders, Golden Girls, and the flag and rifle corps per- 
formed. Then Mrs. Poole’s Spanish class led a cheer in Span- 
ish. 

Festivities continued at the parade with bands, floats, and 
Homecoming beauties on cars. Sophomores won the float 
competition with their “Roast the Lions.” 

The football game provided the most exciting action of all! 
When time ran out with a tie score, the game was extended into 
two overtimes. Cheers rose from the tense fans as the team was 
awarded one point for the most yardage to win the game! 

Students celebrated the victory at the dance following the 
game. The new queen, Hope Bickley, and her court led the first 
dance. Enjoying music by Earl, everyone danced away the final 
hours of Homecoming Day; the perfect end to an unforgettable 
day!

ALL IN FUN 


There comes a time in everyone's life 
when you must come to the aid of your 
country, or in this case the aid of your 
homeroom. Among the numerous Home- 
coming events, Senior Games are the most 
exciting. Although others could probably 
think of different words to describe them, 
especially the ones who were involved in the 
races. 

It takes a whole week to prepare for two 
days’ worth of competition between senior 
homerooms. During this time you could 
probably see many students riding down the 
halls on tricycles. 

There were several games which varied 
from untying knotted socks to consuming 
disgusting food. The events included the egg 
toss, onion race, tricycle race, sock race, 
and the principal's race, but one contest that 
got the most publicity was the Mr. and Mrs. 
Baker High Competition. Two people were 
chosen from each senior homeroom to dress 
up as a man and a woman from Baker 
High. 


“It felt so funny to be talking 
to somebody and realize they 
didn’t recognize who I was!” 

— Christie Cochran, 
Mr. Baker High from 12F 


Through all this one homeroom prevailed. Mrs. 
Cleveland's homeroom came out on top to claim 
their rightful trophy. Even though the students 
were highly competitive, it was ALL IN FUN.

Mark ONE Up 
for Ecology 


In the past two years many new and exciting 
classes have been added to our curriculum. 
The newest addition is an Ecology class taught 
by Mrs. Kay Kicklighter. 

Ecology is the study of the environment and 
the human impact on it. Pollution, recycling, 
and ozone depletion are among the issues that 
are discussed daily. Not only does the class get 
involved in these serious discussions but most 
of them are able to offer a solution to the 
earth’s most pressing problems. Mr. Spear- 
man, an avid ecologist, is an honorary member 
of the class because he shares in all of the 
discussions. He even had the opportunity to 
teach the class. He loved every minute of it! 

Currently the Ecology class is involved in a 
project which requires the aid of the commu- 
nity. The project is known as a backyard hab- 
itat. This means that the animals’ and other 
living things’ habitats will be preserved. The 
area will be used as an outdoor classroom. 
Schools in the Peach County School System 
will be allowed to use these at any time. 


Top right: As you can see ecology is not all serious stuff. Ben Butler, Jason Rowland, and 
Sheftall Lanter can prove it!

Important 
Decisions 


The humongous responsibility of putting on a 
prom was, as always, placed on the Juniors. 
The elected class officers and homeroom rep- 
resentatives met every Wednesday with Mrs. 
Hubbard, Mrs. Lee, and Mr. Slusser to discuss 
prom details. “At the meetings we always

explained Becky Schooks with a laugh. 


“We always ended up fighting, but that 
was the fun part.” 
— Becky Schooks 


By the end of the first semester Junior homer- 
ooms had voted on prom colors, theme, and 
Junior dues. To raise more money for the prom, 
volunteers waited tables on Junior night at Piz- 
za Hut. 

After money was raised and important de- 
cisions were made, all that were left were 
hours and hours of work to prepare what they 
hoped would be the best prom ever. Then on 
May 11 the much awaited night arrived. Every- 
thing was worthwhile. “The prom this year 
turned out to be a success,” was Germain 
Schofield's view.

DRESSED TO KILL 


It was like stepping into the Twi- 
light Zone. The halls were lined with 
little demons, vampires, witches, 
and worst of all, clowns! The stu- 
dents became prey to the heckling 
creatures. 

Halloween is a favorite holiday of 
children, but the students of PCHS 
learned that it’s also a favorite of 
teachers. They decided to “dress 
up” the holiday. However, much 
work did not get done, because the 
students couldn’t concentrate. It is 
very hard to take seriously someone 
who is wearing a large, red, rubber 
ornament on his nose. 


“T loved the look of shock on my 

students’ faces as I walked in 
the room to start class!” 

— Miss Rogers, 

Computer Teacher 


The students hope the teachers at PCHS will 
carry on with this newfangled tradition. Not only 
does it show teacher participation but it also serves 


as a day of relaxation for students and teachers.

Teachers’ Greatest Moments 


Mrs. Conner’s expression speaks for itself 


“TI remember my first snipe hunt,” laughed Mrs. Con- 
ner. ‘“Back when I was in college, my best friend took me 
down this long dirt road. Then she gave me a bag and left 
me by some bushes. She told me that if I was quiet and 
still enough, I would catch a snipe. She left me in the dark 
for about thirty minutes. Finally, when my friend came 
back, she found me crying.”

Starting to Fit In 


The Sophomores are happy not to be Fresh- 
men anymore. Jada Bowling said when asked, 
“two more years before we become SENI- 
ORS." The Sophomores worry the ‘‘new”’ 
Freshmen the most, because the Juniors had 
harassed them unmercifully the year before. 

No longer needing to use their handbooks or 
to ask directions, Sophomores have settled into 
“high school life.’ They look forward to be- 
coming Juniors and giving the prom for the 
Seniors next year. 


“As a Sophomore you get more 
respect from your fellow class- 
mates, especially Freshmen.” 
— Alfred Conteh 


During their Sophomore year, many students receive 
their drivers license and begin driving to school. They no 
longer have to ride the ‘yellow tube” or be picked up by 
their MOTHER! 

Alfred Conteh summed it all up by saying, “As a 
Sophomore you get more respect from your fellow class- 
mates, especially Freshmen.” 

“Say What?” Jartu Toles and Felicia Solomon exchange gossip with 
their sophomore pals. 


Because of his football injury, Alex Vinson does not quite make it to 
class on time.

Tacky Day 


Against All Odds 


To look around at orientation, one might 
have thought, “This class is not going to make it 
four years!” And on the first day of school, some 
Freshmen may have wondered themselves, as 
they screamed, “Which way to Mrs. Gatliff's 
class?” or “When do I go to lunch?” 

After a week of chaos, the Freshmen began 
to learn the ropes. They even began partic- 
ipating in the pep rallies. They won the spirit 
stick at the first pep rally. 


“I was extremely nervous. It 
was the worst time of my life.” 
— Hal Kennedy 

Freshman 


Freshmen have also had the chance to elect 
class officers. These officers have been work- 
ing diligently and constructively to plan ed- 
ucational and social activities for the students. 
Karan Kendrick, the President, found this to 
say about their class, “We get to work!”

Practice Makes 


Perfect 


Just as students had to study to make the 
grade, athletes had to practice to be able to 
win. Coaches had players start training 
weeks before competition with other schools 
began, so that the players would be in “tip-top 
shape.” 

Through practice, teammates became 
closer. To win, the team had to act as one. To 
be able to do that, the players had to know 
how each of their teammates would react in 
every situation. Coaches’ pushing moved the 
teams to be more and more like a “well-oiled 
machine.” 

Football players began work the spring be- 
fore their games, working through the fun- 
damentals of the game. In the hot summer 
sun, coaches worked with their groups, shap- 
ing them for the coming games. Football play- 
ers worked year round by joining the weight 
lifting program. 

In the summer, softball players also sweat- 
ed in the sun, getting ready for the fall games. 
Heather Anthony said, “All that running — 
that was the hardest part of practice!” 

Summer camps at Georgia Southern Uni- 
versity helped cheerleaders and some of the 


"It's hot and sweaty ‘cause we 
worked ourselves to death!” — 
Amy Tharpe 

Senior Cheerleader 


baseball players work up their sport. Darrell 
Halmann and Tony Locke said camp was one 
of the best parts of their summer. 

Basketball practice paid off in the winter as 
well as the months of work put in by track, 
tennis and baseball teams. At times, practice 
was difficult, and many of the players thought 
that they would not make it, but they did, and 
it was worth it! As the players looked back at 
the beginning of the season, they realized 
that all of the work did actually help!

98 / Football 





At the beginning of the year many of the 
fans were skeptical of this season because 
our football team had a whole new sched- 
ule, but as the season progressed the 
Trojans proved that they were a winning 
team. Our only loss was to Kendrick High 
from Columbus. There were many close 
games, but every time we came out on top. 

The 9-1 record the Trojans had was the 
best Peach County High has seen in a long 
time. Even though we only lost one game, 
we were unable to go to the play-offs be- 
cause two other teams in the subregion had 
the same record. Those two other teams 
went instead of us. 

We are proud of our Trojans for the tre- 
mendous effort everyone put forth to make 
it a winning season. Congratulations!

This year’s cheerleading squad proved to be excellent. At camp they 
received the spirit stick for the fourth year in a row. This year’s squad was 
also chosen as an award of excellence nominee which is a very great honor. 


As the year progressed the squad grew closer and became better and

Basketball season brought cheer to the dreary winter with 
improved records for girls and boys teams. The boys, led by 
junior Greg Streeter, swept the Columbus schools with im- 
pressive wins. In tight situations quick thinking and accurate 
shots, like Trent Parker’s three-pointers, pulled the team 
through to victory. 

Coach Cherry was proud of the effort her girls team showed 
all season long. They played hard and came through with big 
wins like the 72-27 victory over Spencer. Senior Natalie White 
drew cheers for her exciting performance on the court each 
game. 

The basketball teams both made an impressive place for 
themselves among the new competition this season.

What makes band members spend long, hot sum- 
mer days in the sun and freezing Friday nights 
performing on the field, and long awaited Saturdays 
marching in some parade? What about all the head- 
aches and scratchy uniforms and exasperated di- 
rectors or squad leaders shouting orders? What's so 
good about being in band to make a person go to all 
that trouble? 

One student had the simple answer, “It’s fun!” 


“Marching season is the best 
part of the year.’ Kendra 
Banks 


Kendra Banks backed it up by saying that even 
though it was hard sometimes, in the end it was all 
worth it. 

Mr. Lindsey, the director, agreed. After many 
years of directing, he knew all the pros and cons. This 
year's band was one of the definite pros. “The 
Marching band had some of the most experienced 
players. An exceptionally strong brass section and 
experienced woodwinds allowed us to play level 4 and 
5 in Concert Band.” 

Enjoying band just depended on how a person 
chose to look at it. Instead of cramped bus rides, they 
were fun times to be with friends. Band always 
seemed to be filled with time for jokes and fun. The 
excitement of a good performance far outweighed a 
little cold weather, especially if that meant snuggling 
up with someone special to keep warm. No one could 
beat the pride of winning all superior trophies at the 
Hawkinsville Invitational Marching Festival of the 
excellent and superior ratings at the Old South March- 
ing Band on Newnan. Best of all, the band led the 
crowd at football games, cheering and playing tunes to 
spur on the players on the field. “It is hard work,” 
senior Elgin Mayfield admitted, “But there's lots of 
time for fun.”

Parade Rest! 


What's the best part of a parade? Some said the bright floats 
or pretty girls on flashy cars, but most agreed that the band 
brings the biggest excitement to a parade. Everyone awaited 
the toe-tapping sounds of the marching band. Sweet tunes and 
catchy cadences put all in the mood for fun. Plus, the Golden 
Girls, Flags, and Rifles Corps added to the show with drills and 
routines of their own. Swinging flags, flashy poms, and spinning 
rifles kept the crowd pleased like no other attraction. 

Parades were a year round business for the band. Beginning in 
the fall with the school’s Homecoming, band members enjoyed 
the short march through downtown Ff. Valley. It got tougher a 
few weeks later when the Ft. Valley State College Homecoming 
brought people from all over. Cheering fans crowded the street, 
keeping marchers on their toes in the narrow space left. 

Cold weather welcomed Christmas and dual parades in Ft. 
Valley and Byron. Decked in Christmas Cheer, the band an- 
nounced the holiday season. 

Spring offered the annual band trip. Members traveled by bus 
the long distance to Nashville, TN to compete in festival ac- 
tivities; the perfect way to end their season.

“I love getting to perform with the flags,"” Denise Chitty

is definitely worth it.” 

Whether they are twirling flags or rifles, both teams shine 
in halftime shows and pep rallies. Led by captains Pamela 
Greer, Michelle Barron, Veronda Mathis, and director Jus- 
tine Girdner, groups practice both in their own class period at 
school and after hours with the rest of the band each day.

that behind us and pull together.”

"5, 6, 7, 8!" drill team captain LaTisha Fluellen clapped the beat 
as co-captains Amanda Swift and Hope Bickley led the line through 
their dance once more. Director, Mrs. Debra Byrd, watched hawk- 
eyed for errors. Soon she would point out places that needed 
improvement. Sometimes that meant extra practices. “Perfecting a 
routine happens when the team members are willing to put in that 
extra time and effort. The enthusiasm of these girls helped us 
through those long rehearsals,’ said Mrs. Byrd. 

Hard work paid off. Aside from dancing at halftime, marching in 
parades, and entertaining at pep-rallies, Golden Girls received 
invitations to perform in two school productions; Trojan Follies and 
the Christmas Cabaret. They danced in the community sponsored 
Education Pep rally. They also marched with other Adcianta drill 
teams in the opening of the Macy's Christmas Parade in Atlanta. 

During the summer, 14 dancers attended the Universal Dance 
Association camp in Carrollton. The girls learned about 20 dances 
and were awarded ribbons for individual performance, bringing 
home 54 blue ribbons. They won second place in the home routine 
competition against the other drill teams. They also won a spirit 
stick for cooperative behavior and extra effort. Their second place 
trophy qualified them for the National Dance Competition in 
Orlando, Florida, where they performed in the Spring. Seniors Angel 
Dailey, Tami Shealy, and Hope Bickley agreed the trip was the best 
part of their final season. Captain LaTisha Fluellen concluded, “‘It 
was teamwork and good attitudes that helped us perform well. I was 
proud of that.”

In Rain, Sleet, or Snow! 


Seniors made their night special despite the weather. 


The weather report was grim: 100% 
chance of rain. Band members groaned, 
especially seniors. The last home game of 
the year, when they would be honored 
for four years of hard work would be 
rained out, A busy week of preparation 
was in vain. 

Knowing how much it meant to the 
seniors, Mr. Lindsey broke the usual 
monotony of sitting in the bandroom 
through a rainy day with the announce- 
ment that the band would perform. The 
wet, freezing crowd cheered as they head- 
ed on to the field for half-time bringing a 
lighter mood to the dreary night. In a 
few moments all the excitement of any 
other night was back as the full band 
opened with a mix of the best songs of 
the year. The crowd roared as half the 
band put their instruments down and 
danced along with the flags, rifles, and 
drill team.

field and performed a jazz ‘‘In the

Classic Romans 


The Junior Classical League, known as the 
Latin Club, has as its main purpose the main- 
tenance of the history of Roman culture. 

Members of the Junior Classical League meet 
once each school month to celebrate in standard 
Roman tradition. New members must dress in 
togas for the semi-annual initiation party held at 
the local Pizza Hut. This party is held once during 
October and once during May. At the first party, 
officers are elected for the remainder of the 
school year. 

Members also place orders for Latin Club t- 
shirts, which are proudly displayed by all at the 
monthly meetings. Christie Cochran and Bradley 
Carthon are co-presidents this year. Alex Vinson 
and Tracey Penson are vice presidents.

also meets many mornings before school to get work done. This 
year that work included preparing and distributing three hun- 
dred red, white, and blue bows to honor U.S. military forces 
stationed in the Middle East. Three hundred red ribbons were 
also prepared and distributed for the “Tie One On” Campaign, 
which encouraged students not to drink and drive. More than 
one thousand red ribbons were distributed to Arrive Alive 
members, as well as students and teachers, to be worn during 
National Drug Awareness Week, October 21-28. Arrive Alive 
sponsored a vehicle in the Fort Valley Christmas Parade, as well 
as one in the Byron Christmas Parade. During the Christmas 
season, several thousand ribbons were tied on cars in the Fort 
Valley and Byron communities to remind people of the dangers 
of drinking and driving. 

Prom Week had many reminders to students of the hazards of 
drinking and driving. A speaker for a student-wide assembly 
program was employed, and fresh red ribbons were tied to 
student and faculty vehicles. 

Because of a successful fund-raising campaign this year, Ar- 
rive Alive was able to sponsor the purchase of a picnic table for 
the outdoor dining area beside the cafeteria.

Getting Down to Business 


The famous sellers of TOM-WATT items be- 
gin a new year full of exciting but traditional 
events. The first of the events included, of 
course, TOM-WATT. Beginning in the first of 
the year FBLA members swamped teachers 
with the idea of spending money on the 
cute, little gifts that would become “great 
little Christmas gifts’ later. A prize was given 
to the number one seller .. . Pam Yeomans 
stole the show! 

Another tradition that was fulfilled, as ex- 
pected, was the “Santa’s little elf’’ cam- 
paign. The FBLA members each chose a 
teacher to present gifts to show their ap- 
preciation for all they had done. It was a 
success. And just between you and me... 
the teachers really love it!

Vocational SUCCESS 


This year marks the 26th birthday of the 
Vocational Industrial Clubs of America. VICA is 
the national organization for trade, industrial, 
technical, and health occupations. The theme 
guiding all activities is ‘‘VICA: Quality at 
Work.”’ 

Quality is a way of thinking and acting that 
yields a way of living and doing business. VI- 
CA’s dedication to quality begins with its em- 
phasis on developing well-rounded students and 
quality employees by building self-confidence, 
positive work attitudes, and good communica- 
tion skills. 

The highlight of this year was having Kather- 
yn Rackley, a culinary arts student, compete on 
the national level. Other projects and training 
included leadership skills, food drive for needy 
families, teacher appreciation breakfast, and 
distributing yellow ribbons during the Persian 
Gulf crisis.

ALL KEYED UP 


These guys are all keyed up in the community. 
The 1990-91 PCHS Key Club has been a major asset 
to our county. This is the second year that the Key 
Club has been extremely involved in community 
services. 

There are many services that the Key Club has 
performed for this area, several of them include 
visits to the nursing homes, dinners for the needy 
families at Christmas, adopt-a-highway program, 
and letters to the soldiers in the Middle East. 
“Carolling for Cans’ was a Christmas program that 
involved the singing of Christmas carols in ex- 
change for any canned goods. The Key Club took 
this program very seriously and many members 
showed to take part in this program. The needy 
families that received these canned goods were 
very thankful. I’m sure the Key Club was glad that 
they could make someone’s Christmas better.

CRACKED UP TO BE 


Literary / 143 





It has been an honor being the editor of this year’s edition 
of the Retrospect. Along with joy, there comes frustration, 
and I definitely had my share of that. But, I have to admit, 
there are no greater people than the ones I had the op- 
portunity to work with this past year. 

Whenever I was in a tight, they all helped me. Thanks 
you guys for always going the extra mile. But most of all, 
thanks for your devotion and friendship. 

To my parents, I give them all the credit of what I am 
today. I love you both! To Chris, thanks for all the support 
and understanding. You've really kept me going! 


Angie Queen 


Being advisor of the 1991 Retrospect has been a joy for 
me as well being the advisor for fast year’s edition of the 
annual, This year’s staff had been very positive and 
extraordinarily determined. They even persuaded me to give 
my approval for a title which is incorrect grammatically! But 
their spirit and hard work more than made up for this minor 
indiscretion! 

I give my hearty thanks to the whole yearbook staff for a 
job well-done, for the yearbook is the fruit of their dedicated 
labors. As advisor, I merely sign the receipts! 

Finally, to editor Angie Queen, I give my enthusiastic 
appreciation in fulfilling the numerous demands of this 
position. 

Having the last word, I cannot resist the chance to correct 
and write, IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE YEARS!

War and Peace 


On August 2, 1990 Iraqi troops, under the leadership of 
Saddam Hussein, invaded the nation of Kuwait. After 
several months of negotiations, sanctions, and other 
forms of peaceful coersion, President Bush decided to use 
military might to push the Iraqis out of Kuwait. So began 
seven months of U.S. led coalition forces build-up in Saudi 
Arabia. This was the beginning of Operation Desert 
Shield. The transition to Operation Desert Storm came on 
January 16, 1991 with offensive air strikes against stra- 
tegic Iraqi military positions inside Kuwait and Iraq, leav- 
ing the Iraqi airforce crippled. Once this was done, the 
coalition airforce, which had air superiority, began to 
weaken the Iraqi forces. Six weeks later, the coalition 
ground forces began the liberation of Kuwait. One hun- 
dred hours later, Kuwait was free, and the war was over.

REO Ulu L 


* 


Thirty years ago, Mrs. Betty Cleveland began teaching school. 
The first four years, she taught sixth and seventh grade science 
at the Fort Valley Elementary School and then moved to the high 


school to teach twelfth grade English. 

Mrs. Cleveland has had many memorable moments. In her 
first week teaching, a child, in her fifth grade homeroom, 
brought a pistol to school. Fortunately, she was able to retrieve 
the gun without anyone being hurt. 

As have most teachers, Mrs. Cleveland has gotten many 
interesting answers from her students. While she was teaching 
science, Mrs. Cleveland asked, “What are the three states of 
matter?’ The answer should be: gas, liquid, and solid. However, 
the student, who must have been asleep, answered, ‘Georgia, 
South Carolina, and North Carolina.” 

Mrs. Cleveland said that when a student wants to participate 
in class and does not want the class to end, she has done a good 
job. 

We would like to dedicate the 1991 Retrospect to Mrs. Betty 
Cleveland because we think that she is a number one teacher!

favorite epic poem.

Chance... 


Well it is that time of year again — 

he we’ve made it through Christmas, we’ve 

made it through semester exams, but 

most of all, we’ve made it through SPRING 
BREAR!!! 

The end of the year brings about so 
many feelings; sadness and joy. For some 
it is the end; for others it is a whole new 
beginning, but through it all, we’ll remem- 
ber 1991 as one of those years!
