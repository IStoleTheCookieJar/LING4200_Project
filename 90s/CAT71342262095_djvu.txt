"Together  we  can  accomplish  a  lot..." 

An  Interview  With 
Assistant  Secretary 
Catherine  Bertini 


In  this  issue  of  Food  and  Nutrition, 
we  are  pleased  to  introduce  USDA's 
Assistant  Secretary  for  Food  and  Con- 
sumer Services,  Catherine  Bertini.  She 
was  nominated  to  the  post  by  President 
Bush,  confirmed  by  the  Senate,  and 
sworn  in  on  October  10. 

Bertini  set  the  tone  for  her  new  task 
in  remarks  she  gave  at  her  formal 
swearing-in  ceremony,  November  3. 
She  said,  "Our  challenge  is  to  work  to- 
gether to  improve  delivery  of  services 
and  insure  basic  nutritional  support  for 
those  in  need.  I  promise  I  will  work  ag- 
gressively and  cooperatively.  I  hope  I 
will  work  creatively  and  efficiently.  To- 
gether we  can  accomplish  a  lot." 

Bertini  came  to  USDA  from  the  De- 
partment of  Health  and  Human  Serv- 
ices (HHS),  where  she  was  Acting 
Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Family  Sup- 
port Administration.  In  that  position, 
she  had  responsibility  for  a  $1 4-billion 
program. 

From  September  1 987  to  March 
1 989,  she  directed  HHS'  Aid  to  Fami- 
lies with  Dependent  Children  Program 
(AFDC),  the  country's  largest  cash  as- 
sistance program,  serving  nearly  4  mil- 
lion families  with  needy  children.

Bertini  also  has  experience  working 
in  the  private  sector.  From  1 977  to 
1 987,  she  was  with  Container  Corpo- 
ration of  America,  managing  public  pol- 
icy, as  well  as  state  and  local  public 
affairs  and  community  relations. 

Following  is  the  text  of  an  interview 
with  Assistant  Secretary  Bertini. 

QHow  do  you  feel  your  experi- 
ence at  HHS  will  be  of  value  to 
you  here  at  USDA? 

A One  of  the  reasons  Secretary 
Yeutter  asked  me  to  take  on  this 
responsibility  was  the  2  years  I  spent 
at  the  Department  of  Health  and  Hu- 
man Services  working  in  the  area  of 
welfare  reform  and  managing  the 
AFDC  program. 

In  the  coming  years,  we  hope  to 
achieve  some  conformity  between 
HHS  programs  and  food  stamps.  So  I 
believe  my  background  at  HHS  will  be 
quite  relevant. 

I  also  served  as  the  HHS  represent- 
ative on  the  White  House  Low-Income 
Opportunity  Board.  As  an  Assistant 
Secretary  at  USDA,  I  remain  on  that 
board,  wearing  a  different  hat. 

I  was  very  encouraged  about  achiev- 
ing conformity  when  I  went  to  a  meet- 
ing of  food  stamp  directors  last 
November  in  Alabama.  They  were 
hopeful  that  my  background  in  AFDC 
will  facilitate  conformity  between 
AFDC  and  food  stamps. 

Of  course,  the  issue  of  trying  to 
make  our  programs  conform  has  been 
on  the  table  for  a  long  time,  but  maybe 
we  can  do  more  to  work  out  some  of 
the  differences. 

QWhat  would  be  the  reasons  to 
bring  programs  together? 

A There  are  several  reasons.  The 
first  is  to  make  more  sense  of  the 
programs  from  the  clients'  perspective. 
The  people  who  need  these  programs 
should  have  an  easier  time  applying  for 
and  receiving  benefits  through  them. 
That  goes  for  food  stamps,  AFDC, 


or  any  other  assistance  program. 

And  by  making  the  programs  more 
compatible,  we  help  not  only  the  clients 
but  also  the  caseworkers  and  others 
who  work  with  clients.  Certainly,  if  the 
programs  conformed,  there  would  be 
less  frustration  and  fewer  obstacles  for 
the  caseworkers. 

Making  the  programs  conform  would 
also  save  administrative  costs.  As  part 
of  our  effort  toward  conformity,  we're 
currently  testing  an  electronic  benefits 
transfer  (EBT)  system  in  Baltimore. 
Clients  use  one  plastic  card  to  obtain 
benefits  from  food  stamps,  AFDC, 
child  support  enforcement,  and  other 
state  public  assistance  programs. 

HHS,  USDA,  and  the  Maryland  De- 
partment of  Human  Resources  are 
each  paying  a  piece  of  the  administra- 
tive costs  for  the  system.  The  point  is, 
if  we  can  share  these  costs,  there  will 
be  a  savings  for  each  of  the  agencies. 

The  same  is  true  for  the  people  who 
are  delivering  the  services.  If  one  per- 
son can  handle  two  programs,  then 
maybe  we  don't  need  two  people  to  do 
the  job.  I'm  not  suggesting  this  is  a  way 
to  cut  back  on  employees.  I  do  think, 
however,  it's  going  to  be  a  way  to  save 
some  administrative  costs  over  the 
long  term. 

To  get  back  to  my  experience  at 
HHS,  I'll  mention  that  I  did  a  lot  of  work 
with  interest  groups — advocacy 
groups  and  others.  Of  course,  this  will 
be  relevant  to  what  we  do  here  at 
USDA. 

At  HHS,  I  also  gained  valuable  expe- 
rience writing  regulations  for  welfare 
reform.  This  was  very  instructive  both 
in  terms  of  getting  involved  in  depth  in 
the  issues  and  in  working  cooperatively 
with  a  lot  of  folks  from  interest  groups, 
states,  and  federal  agencies. 

QWhat  is  your  preferred  style  of 
management? 

A In  terms  of  style  or  method  of 
operating,  when  we  talk  about 
difficult  issues,  we  need  to  have  every- 
body at  the  table  who  needs  to  talk 
about  them.  For  instance,  when  we  talk 
about  conformity  among  programs, 
we're  not  going  to  just  talk  about  it  at 
USDA  or  in  the  Bush  Administration; 
we're  going  to  talk  about  it  with  the

the  Washington  area  and  in  other  parts 
of  the  country.

Spring  1 990 


Last  fall,  Assistant  Secretary  Bertini  toured 
the  Greater  Chicago  Food  Depository,  a  non- 
profit agency  that  distributes  food  donated 
by  USD  A  as  well  as  by  private  donors.  Here, 
agency  staff  show  Bertini  some  freeze-dried 
cauliflower  donated  by  a  food  company. 

states  and  with  Congress,  and  with 
other  interested  people. 

When  we  talk  about  employment  and 
training  performance  standards,  we're 
going  to  talk  about  them  with  Labor 
and  HHS  and  with  states,  not  just 
among  ourselves.  When  we  talk  about 
nutrition  monitoring,  that's  an  issue  be- 
tween the  Human  Nutrition  Information 
Service  (HNIS),  HHS,  FNS,  the  Hill, 
plus  the  interest  groups. 

The  thing  I'm  most  proud  of  in  my 
2  years  at  HHS  is  the  rule  we  issued  to 
implement  the  AFDC  work  program. 
It's  known  as  the  Job  Opportunity  and 
Basic  Skills  Program  (JOBS).  We've 
had  a  great  deal  of  compliments  about 
that,  even  from  people  who  don't  agree 
with  everything  in  the  rule.  They  think 
it's  a  good  product,  and  they  applaud 
the  process  we  used,  which  gave 
everybody  a  chance  to  have  input. 

I'm  proud  of  that  achievement — an 
excellent  product  created  in  a  timely 
and  open  fashion.  That's  how  I  like  to 
operate. 

QCan  you  tell  us  a  little  about 
your  background  and  how  you 
came  to  be  involved  with  service 
programs? 

A I  became  interested  in  public 
service  when  my  father  was  first 
elected  to  the  city  council  in  Cortland, 
New  York.  I  was  1 3  when  I  went  with 
him  to  city  council  meetings  and,  of 
course,  whatever  my  father's  position 
was  on  whatever  issue,  I  felt  his  was 
the  only  correct  position.  That  was  my 
first  exposure  to  government  and 
politics. 

At  about  the  same  time,  my  aunt  was 
a  nurse  in  the  Air  Force  and  some  of 
her  colleagues  had  been  assigned  to 
Vietnam.  They  came  back  on  leave  and 
told  a  group  of  us  young  people  about 
all  the  needs  of  the  poor  citizens  of 
Vietnam. 

They  told  of  how,  on  their  off-duty 
hours,  U.S.  medical  personnel  would 
go  into  the  villages  to  try  to  help  the  ci- 
vilians, but  it  was  difficult  because  they 
didn't  have  basic  supplies — like  soap. 
They  had  already  received  donated 
medical  supplies,  but  they  needed 
soap  to  help  people  improve  their  sani- 
tary conditions. 

A  group  of  us  organized  a  "soap 
drive"  at  school  and  by  one  means  or 

4 


another,  we  collected  mounds  and 
mounds  of  it.  I  think  the  nurses  were 
overwhelmed  with  all  the  soap  we  sent. 

That  was  one  of  the  first  things  I  did 
that  made  me  realize  there  were  people 
who  needed  help,  and  I  was  interested 
in  helping  them. 

When  I  was  still  a  teenager,  I  had  the 
opportunity  to  manage  two  summer 
youth  employment  programs. 

And  years  later,  as  an  adult,  I  did  a 
lot  of  volunteer  work  in  Chicago.  I 
served  food  at  a  homeless  women's 
shelter  and  worked  with  young  people 
in  the  inner  city  on  job  development  and 
training  in  two  different  programs. 

I  also  served  on  the  Illinois  State 
Scholarship  Commission  and  on  a 
board  that  looked  into  governance  in 
the  Chicago  public  schools.  And  I  had 
the  opportunity  to  serve  the  state  as  a 
commissioner  on  the  Illinois  Human 
Rights  Commission. 

I've  been  interested  in  programs  that 
deliver  a  service  for  people  for  a  num- 
ber of  years,  and  I  was  very  lucky  be- 
cause the  Reagan  White  House 
offered  me  the  position  of  director  of 
the  Office  of  Family  Assistance  in  the 
Department  of  Health  and  Human 
Services. 


" ...when  we  talk  about 
difficult  issues,  we 
need  to  have  everybody 
at  the  table  who  needs 
to  talk  about  them.  For 
instance,  when  we  talk 
about  conformity 
among  programs,  we're 
not  going  to  just  talk 
about  it  at  USD  A  or  in 
the  Bush  Administra- 
tion; we  're  going  to 
talk  about  it  with  the 
states  and  with 
Congress,  and  with 
other  interested 
people."

Q Since  the  Bush  Administration 
has  been  in  office,  it  has  been 
inclined  to  maintain  the  current 
level  of  federal  support  for  food  as- 
sistance programs.  Do  you  think 
this  trend  will  continue? 

A Basically,  I  see  the  major 
programs  continuing  as  they  are. 
President  Bush  places  a  high  priority 
on  serving  those  in  need. 

QAs  the  Assistant  Secretary  for 
Food  and  Consumer  Services, 
you  are  responsible  for  a  massive 
food  assistance  effort  that  costs 
over  $23  billion  a  year.  How  does 
one  approach  such  a  monumental 
task? 


A Well,  there  are  2,000  people  in 
FNS,  and  many  more  at  the  state 
and  local  level,  working  on  the  pro- 
grams. Often,  they've  worked  on  them 
for  years  and  there's  a  lot  of  expertise, 
a  lot  of  dedication.  That's  the  number 
one  reason  why  I  feel  confident  about 
managing  them. 

I  hope  to  give  some  direction  to  the 
programs  and  have  President  Bush's 
concerns  be  reflected  both  in  how  they 
operate  and  in  the  direction  they  are 
given. 

QWhen  you  spoke  to  the  FNS 
staff  on  October  12,  you  asked 
them  to  be  compassionate  when 
dealing  with  program  recipients. 
Will  you  elaborate? 


"...although  we're  a 
very  prosperous 
country,  we  still  have 
millions  of  people  in 
need  of  some  basic 
support.  I  think  the 
most  important 
long-range  challenge 
is  to  make  sure  the 
programs  continue 
ana  to  operate  them 
well  so  that  people 
don't  go  hungry." 


A Sometimes  when  we  look  at  an 
issue  or  program  policy,  the  way 
we  interpret  that  policy  will  reflect  our 
primary  objective  for  the  program.  For 
example,  if  our  objective  is  to  save 
money,  we  will  make  a  policy  decision 
one  way.  But  if  our  objective  is  to  be 
more  accommodating  to  the  clients,  we 
will  make  our  decisions  differently. 

When  President  Bush  gave  his  inau- 
gural address,  he  made  his  objectives 
very  clear.  He  told  us  that  although  we 
have  serious  budget  constraints,  he 
still  wants  us  to  operate  within  the  con- 
text of  a  "kinder,  gentler  America."  To 
me,  that  means  we  should  take  a  softer 
approach  and  lean  in  the  direction  of 
the  clients,  whenever  possible. 

One  concrete  example  of  what  I 
mean  is  the  issue  of  how  we  count  the 
income  that  blind  people  get  for  the 

Food  and  Nutrition 


care  and  feeding  of  their  seeing- 
eye  dogs. 

There  are  two  ways  to  look  at  this  is- 
sue. On  the  one  hand,  we  can  deter- 
mine that  any  cash  income,  regardless 
of  its  purpose,  must  be  counted  as  "in- 
come." This  approach  would  cause  a 
blind  person  to  receive  a  smaller  food 
stamp  allotment. 

The  other  approach  says,  yes,  it's 
cash,  but  it's  for  the  seeing-eye  dog. 
And  a  blind  person  can't  operate  out- 
side of  home  without  a  seeing-eye  dog. 
Thus,  the  money  should  not  be 
counted  as  "income"  for  purposes  of 
calculating  the  amount  of  food  stamps 
to  be  received. 

There  are  other  examples  I  could 
cite,  such  as  the  voucher  system  West 
Virginia  uses  once  a  year  to  provide 
needy  children  with  clothes  for  school. 
In  the  past,  USDA  considered  these 
vouchers  as  payments.  Consequently, 
they  reduced  a  family's  food  stamp  al- 
lotment. Now,  we  call  them  annual 
"emergency  payments,"  which  don't 
count  as  income.  This  is  what  I  mean 

Spring  1990 


by  a  softer,  more  compassionate 
approach. 

QWhat  do  you  see  as  the  major 
challenges  that  face  the  food 
programs  in  the  coming  years? 

A The  first  challenge  is  to  work  for  a 
time  when  there  are  no  hungry 
Americans,  at  least  none  who  are  invol- 
untarily hungry.  Beyond  that,  we  should 
work  so  that  all  citizens  have  a  reason- 
able chance  at  having  a  nutritious  diet. 

Without  the  food  assistance  pro- 
grams, we  obviously  would  have  a  seri- 
ous problem  with  hunger  in  this 
country.  Because,  although  we're  a 
very  prosperous  country,  we  still  have 
millions  of  people  in  need  of  some 
basic  support.  I  think  the  most  impor- 
tant long-range  challenge  is  to  make 
sure  the  programs  continue  and  to  op- 
erate them  well  so  that  people  don't 
go  hungry. 

QWhat  direction  do  you  see  the 
food  assistance  programs 
taking  over  the  next  10  years? 


Opposite  page:  While  visiting  a  local  food 
stamp  office  in  Chicago,  Bertini  stops  to 
talk  with  income  maintenance  supervisor 
Donna  Clay.  Above:  At  Massachusetts' 
North  Quincy  High  School,  with  FNS 
regional  administrator  Harold  McLean, 
she  answers  questions  from  a  student  who 
works  on  the  school  newspaper. 


A I've  already  mentioned  serving 
hungry  people,  but  as  a  corollary, 
we  need  to  look  carefully  at  who  is  hun- 
gry in  America  and  who  is  poor.  I  think 
the  government  has  to  insure  we  are 
serving  that  precise  population. 

And,  when  we  look  at  the  percentage 
of  children  who  are  poor  in  this  country, 
we  are  looking  at  a  very  serious  prob- 
lem that  has  to  be  addressed  in  some 
very  public  and  major  ways. 

I  believe  that  many  problems  in  our 
communities,  such  as  drugs,  crime, 
and  teen  pregnancies,  can  be  partially 
attributed  to  the  fact  that  we  have  neg- 
lected our  children,  to  a  large  degree. 

QHave  you  had  the  opportunity 
to  actually  see  some  of  the 
food  assistance  programs  in 
operation? 

7 


A Yes,  I've  already  eaten  lunch  at 
several  schools,  and  I  plan  to  visit 
at  least  one  school  each  month. 

The  very  clear  message  I  got  from 
eating  lunch  at  school  is  that  while  we 
have  an  important  job  to  assure  that  we 
are  serving  nutritious  meals,  we  also 
have  to  make  sure  the  food  is  attractive 
so  that  it  will  be  eaten.  Because  unless 
these  little  people  put  it  in  their  stom- 
achs, what's  on  their  plate  is  irrelevant. 

I've  had  a  chance  to  visit  a  number  of 
WIC  clinics  and  have  seen  how  WIC 
operates.  Certainly,  I've  heard  rave  re- 
views about  the  WIC  program  and  how 
helpful  it  is  to  people. 

I've  applied  for  food  stamps  in  Ala- 
bama. Of  course,  they  pretended  they 
didn't  know  I  really  wasn't  eligible.  But  I 
learned  lessons  there,  including  how 
silly  some  of  the  application  require- 
ments are.  We're  trying  to  eliminate 
these  where  possible. 

QHas  Secretary  Yeutter  given 
you  any  instructions  regard- 
ing the  food  programs? 

A Yes,  but  before  I  mention  them, 
I  want  to  say  that  the  Secretary 
intimately  knows  the  issues  we  deal 
with  because  in  1 973-74  he  was  the 


Assistant  Secretary  for  Marketing  and 
Consumer  Services,  with  responsibil- 
ity for  food  assistance  programs.  He's 
very  interested  in  our  success  and  in 
the  continuation  of  the  programs. 

He  is  committed  to  the  Food  Stamp 
Program,  and  he  actually  opened  the 
first  WIC  clinic  in  Pineville,  Kentucky,  in 
January  1 974.  We  couldn't  have  a  Sec- 
retary with  a  better  understanding  of 
what  we're  doing. 

One  of  the  challenges  Secretary 
Yeutter  has  asked  us  to  face  is  the  is- 
sue of  fraud  in  the  Food  Stamp  Pro- 
gram. He  wants  us  to  do  all  that's 
required  to  fight  fraud,  and  he  wants  us 
to  consider  what  else  we  could  be 
doing. 

I  told  the  FNS  regional  administra- 
tors recently  I  don't  think  being  tough 
on  fraud  is  inconsistent  with  taking  a 
softer  approach.  Because  with  fraud, 
we're  talking  about  people  who  are  rip- 
ping off  clients  and  taxpayers.  We 
should  be  careful  with  eligible  clients 
and  intolerant  with  those  who  commit 
fraud. 

And  besides  doing  all  we  can  to  re- 
duce food  stamp  fraud,  the  Secretary 
has  asked  us  to  work  toward  conform- 


ity among  programs  wherever  possi- 
ble. I  discussed  this  issue  earlier. 

QDo  you  have  anything  you 
would  like  to  say  to  the 
employees  of  FNS  and  HNIS? 

A Yes.  I'm  proud  and  pleased  to  join 
you  in  your  work  because  the 
roles  we  have  are  so  important  for  this 
country.  Whether  the  people  we  serve 
are  children,  babies,  or  other  poor 
Americans,  we  have  a  great  deal  of 
responsibility  to  them.  We  have  re- 
sponsibility to  run  efficient  programs, 
be  creative  in  how  we  use  federal  dol- 
lars, be  resourceful  and  willing  in  our 
response  to  natural  disasters,  and  to 
be  compassionate. 

We  also  have  the  responsibility  to 
reach  all  Americans  to  help  them  un- 
derstand the  nutritional  value  of  food. 

Our  responsibility  is  to  go  beyond 
just  operating  the  programs.  We  need 
to  ask:  How  can  we  better  outreach? 
How  can  we  better  tell  people  about 
what  we're  doing?  How  can  we  better 
package  the  programs  with  other  pro- 
grams so  that  the  people  we're  serving 
get  the  best  possible  service  and 
information?

says  Birge  Watkins,  USDA's  Deputy 
Assistant  Secretary  for  Food  and  Con- 
sumer Services.  "Too  often  we  talk 
about  problems  and  don't  mention  the 
opportunities." 

Watkins  is  happy  to  be  in  a  position 
to  help  find  and  develop  opportunities 
"through  creative  issue  analysis"  and 
by  opening  his  door  to  many  diverse 
groups. 

"Effective  policy  making  should  ex- 
amine the  'big  picture'  to  develop  a 
deeper  understanding  of  issues  and  a 
wide  variety  of  options,"  he  says.  He 
feels  it  is  especially  important  to  con- 
sider interest  group  viewpoints  within 
the  parameters  of  overall  Administra- 
tion objectives. 

"It  gives  us  a  chance  to  see  what  dif- 
ferent groups  are  thinking.  It  doesn't 
mean  we're  always  going  to  agree  with 
them  and  accept  everything  they  say. 
But  give  and  take  is  vital  to  the  policy 
process." 

Participating  in  this  process  is  what 
appeals  to  Watkins  about  public  serv- 
ice. "Being  able  to  work  with  problems 
at  the  national  level  is  very  exciting,"  he 
says.  "That's  what  keeps  drawing  me 
to  public  service  rather  than  to  the  busi- 
ness sector." 

A  fresh  approach 
to  management 

His  enthusiasm,  coupled  with  his 
professional  expertise  and  educational 
background,  makes  Watkins  a  wel- 
come addition  to  the  new  management 
team  at  USDA.  Along  with  Assistant 
Secretary  Catherine  Bertini,  Watkins  is 
bringing  a  fresh  approach  to  managing 
the  programs  of  the  Food  and  Nutrition 
Service,  the  Human  Nutrition  Informa- 
tion Service,  and  the  Office  of  the  Con- 
sumer Advisor. 

Secretary  of  Agriculture  Clayton 
Yeutter  echoed  this  sentiment  when 
announcing  his  appointment.  "Watkins' 
10 


management  background  and  his 
Washington  experience  make  a  valua- 
ble combination  which  will  serve  the 
Department  well,"  he  said. 

From  his  work  on  President  Ford's 
White  House  staff,  as  a  member  of  the 
Bush  Transition  Team,  and  as  Assist- 
ant to  the  Administrator  of  USDA's  Ag- 
ricultural Stabilization  and  Conserv- 
ation Service,  Watkins  knows  how  to 
get  things  done  in  Washington. 

Although  new  to  domestic  food  pro- 
grams, Watkins'  work  in  the  interna- 
tional arena  has  made  him  very  aware 
of  hunger  issues. 

He  was  Assistant  Director  of  Presi- 
dent Reagan's  Task  Force  on  Interna- 


tional Private  Enterprise.  He  was  also 
Deputy  Assistant  Director  of  the  Office 
of  International  Training  at  the  Agency 
for  International  Development.  In  those 
jobs  he  saw  first-hand  the  immense 
hunger  and  agricultural  problems  of  de- 
veloping countries  and  learned  much 
about  food  assistance  abroad. 

Believes  in  taking 
a  broad  perspective 

Watkins  feels  his  education  is  a 
great  asset  in  his  new  job.  He  earned  a 
master's  of  public  administration  de- 
gree from  Harvard  University  and  a 
master's  of  business  administration 
from  the  London  Business  School. 


Food  and  Nutrition 


"Both  government  and  business 
schools  teach  you  to  take  a  broader 
perspective,"  he  says.  "They  give  you 
tools  with  which  to  view  policy,  bud- 
get, organization  and  management, 
finance,  and  marketing  in  the  context 
of  an  overall  strategy." 

From  his  earlier  years  as  an  art  ma- 
jor at  Alma  College,  Watkins  knows 
that  the  policy  process  is  not  unlike  the 
creative  process.  "Sometimes  develop- 
ing policy  options  reminds  me  how 
many  colors  one  has  to  choose  from 
when  painting  a  picture.  The  goal  is  to 
make  the  colors  work  well  together." 

This  broad  perspective  has  helped 
Watkins  zero  in  on  a  couple  of  immedi- 
ate goals.  One  is  to  expand  possibili- 
ties of  electronic  benefits  transfer  in  the 
Food  Stamp  Program.  He  feels  this  fits 
in  with  the  longer  goal  the  Administra- 
tion has  of  improving  access  and  secu- 
rity for  food  stamp  recipients. 

"This  is  an  exciting  area,"  says 
Watkins,  "where  interest  groups  play  a 
major  role.  For  example,  we  have  to 
recognize  how  changes  in  technology 
are  gradually  changing  the  way  gro- 
cery retailers  do  business.  Then  we 
can  fashion  an  approach  that  ad- 
dresses their  concerns,  meets  recipi- 
ents' needs,  and  follows  Food  Stamp 
Program  goals." 

Watkins  serves  on  the  policy  group 
for  the  Interagency  Council  for  the 
Homeless  on  behalf  of  Assistant  Sec- 
retary Bertini.  This,  coupled  with  visits 
to  a  number  of  homeless  shelters,  has 
sparked  a  great  interest  for  him  in  how 
USDA's  food  programs  can  better  help 
homeless  people,  particularly  families 
and  children. 

In  addition  to  making  food  programs 
more  accessible  to  the  needy,  Watkins 
wants  to  see  more  incentives  built  into 
them  so  that  recipients  can  become 
self-sufficient  in  the  long  run. 

And  that  gets  back  to  providing  op- 
portunities for  people.  He  wants  to  help 
recipients  find  ways  to  make  good  in- 
comes. "The  Employment  and  Training 
Program  offered  to  food  stamp  recipi- 
ents is  one  way  of  doing  this,"  he  says. 

"Balancing  the  needs  of  all  people," 
says  Watkins,  "is  the  challenge  I  face 
and  welcome  as  the  Deputy  Assistant 
Secretary  for  Food  and  Consumer 
Services.  I'm  very  glad  to  be  here."

Bringing  A  Special  Perspective  To  The  Food  Programs 

Wisconsin  State  Legislator 
Betty  Jo  Nelsen  Is  New 
Administrator  Of  FNS 


FNS  Administrator  Betty  Jo  Nelsen  at  a  press  conference  on  food  distribution. 


/\.nother  member  of  the  new  manage- 
ment team  at  USDA  is  Betty  Jo  Neisen, 
who  earlier  this  year  was  named  ad- 
ministrator of  the  Food  and  Nutrition 
Service  (FNS). 

Nelsen  came  to  FNS  from  the  Wis- 
consin Assembly.  Elected  in  a  special 
election  in  1 979  and  reelected  bienni- 
ally, she  served  on  20  committees  dur- 
ing her  1 0  years  in  the  state 
legislature. 

As  a  member  of  the  Joint  Finance 
Committee,  she  was  one  of  1 6  legisla- 
tors responsible  for  developing  the 
state's  $1 1 -billion  annual  budget.  She 
was  minority  leader  of  the  assembly 
from  1 987-88  and  during  that  time 
served  on  the  Welfare  Reform 
Commission. 

Prior  to  holding  elective  office,  Nel- 
sen coordinated  the  Milwaukee  Volun- 
tary Action  Center  Involvement  Corps, 
where  she  was  responsible  for  all  as- 
pects of  a  pilot  program  linking  corpo- 
rate sector  volunteers  with  nonprofit 
agencies  seeking  voluntary  help. 
She  also  served  as  president  of  the 


Junior  League  of  Milwaukee;  chaired 
the  Agency  Evaluation  Committee  for 
the  United  Way  of  Greater  Milwaukee; 
and  was  program  manager  of  volun- 
teers with  the  Milwaukee  County  De- 
partment of  Public  Welfare. 

A  graduate  of  Dedham  (Massachu- 
setts) High  School,  she  earned  a  bach- 
elor's degree  in  education  with  a  major 
in  food  and  nutrition  from  Massachu- 
setts State  College,  Framingham.  Im- 
mediately after  graduation  from 
college,  she  taught  junior  high  school 
in  Omaha,  Nebraska. 

In  announcing  her  appointment  as 
FNS  administrator,  Secretary  of  Agri- 
culture Clayton  Yeutter  said,  "Betty  Jo 
Nelsen  brings  a  wide  range  of  legisla- 
tive and  public  service  experience  to 
this  vital  post  and  will  be  a  valuable  as- 
set to  the  USDA  team. 

"Active  in  welfare  reform  efforts  in 
Wisconsin,  she  has  demonstrated 
long-standing  interest  in  the  health  and 
welfare  of  those  who  are  served  by 
FNS  programs."

Winning  With  Summer  Meals 

New  Castle  Has 
Food  For  Kids, 
Jobs  For  Teens 


i 


.f  summer  meals  taste  a  bit  like 
home  cooking  to  kids  in  New  Castle, 
Delaware,  it  may  be  because  an  older 
brother  or  cousin  or  next  door  neighbor 
helped  make  them. 

In  an  arrangement  that  benefits 
teens  needing  work  as  well  as  children 
needing  nourishing  food,  lunches  for 
the  Summer  Food  Service  Program 
are  prepared  by  teenagers  hired  by  the 
county  through  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Labor's  Job  Training  Partnership  Act 
Program  (JTPA). 

Summer  mornings  begin  early  for 
the  Manpower  Youth  teens.  By  6  a.m. 
each  weekday,  they  are  already  start- 


ing to  arrive  at  William  Penn  High 
School's  cafeteria  for  a  long  day  of  bak- 
ing, cooking,  assembling,  packing,  and 
delivering  breakfasts  and  lunches  to 
Delaware's  neediest  children.  Last 
summer,  these  young  workers  pre- 
pared meals  for  2,500  New  Castle 
youngsters  at  1 40  sites  throughout  the 
county. 

Sponsored  by 
local  agency 

The  Summer  Food  Service  Program 
is  one  of  several  child  nutrition  pro- 
grams administered  nationally  by 


USDA's  Food  and  Nutrition  Service  in 
cooperation  with  states  and  qualifying 
local  sponsors. 

Summer  program  sponsors  include 
local  municipal  or  county  governments, 
public  or  private  nonprofit  school  food 
authorities,  community  agencies, 
churches,  day  camps,  institutions  pro- 
viding day  care  for  the  handicapped, 
and  residential  camps. 

Targeted  to  low-income  areas,  the 
summer  program  seeks  to  ensure  that 
needy  children  get  well-balanced 
meals  while  school  is  not  in  session. 
As  in  the  National  School  Lunch  Pro- 
gram, meals  follow  federal  nutrition 
guidelines. 

About  20  JTPA  youths  worked  as 
meal  preparers  for  New  Castle's  sum- 
mer program  last  year.  Together,  they 
ran  the  only  self-preparation  center  in 
Delaware.  Ranging  in  age  from  1 4  to 
20  years  old,  they  were  paid  minimum 
wage  through  the  JTPA.  The  program 
offered  them  a  chance  to  make  money 
over  the  summer,  but  they  gained  much 
more.  They  learned  respect  for  author- 
ity, adults,  and  each  other.

Food  and  Nutrition 


Brookmont  Farms  is  one  of  several  summer 
food  program  sites  in  New  Castle. 

Spring  1990  13 


Gladis  Reese  has  been  head  of  the 
kitchen  for  this  program  for  1 5  years. 
She  claims  this  is  her  last  year  but  has 
been  saying  this  for  the  last  few  years. 
Reese  has  seen  the  program  grow 
from  300  lunches  to  over  2,500.  She 
has  also  seen  many  of  her  JTRA  youth 
workers  come  and  go.  "You  have  to  be- 
lieve in  the  program  for  it  to  work,  and  it 
does  work  with  teamwork,"  she  says. 

Teens  have  grown 
along  with  program 

With  feeling  Reese  recounts  the 
years  and  the  special  kids  who  have 
worked  for  her.  "This  program  helps  not 
only  the  low-income  but  the  handi- 

"Drink  your  milk, "  encourages  an  older 
brother,  who  has  taken  time  out  to  make  sure

follow  USD  A  nutrition  guidelines. 


capped  as  well,"  Reese  says.  "It  gives 
them  a  chance  to  be  self-sufficient." 

Last  summer,  Reese  had  a  number 
of  handicapped  youths  working  for  her. 
For  example,  Travis  Hosey  was  con- 
fined to  a  wheelchair  and  used  sign 
language  to  talk  to  his  friend  Steven 
Thomas,  who  was  deaf.  William,  a  par- 
aplegic with  a  heart  condition,  was 
Gladis'  "top  banana"  for  4  years.  He 
now  works  at  a  medical  center  and 
drives  his  own  car. 

Mario,  who  had  no  hands,  had  spe- 
cial fingers  made  for  him.  He  wanted  to 
be  an  opera  singer  and  often  sang 
while  he  worked.  Reese  says  they  all 
watched  him  win  first  prize  in  a  talent 
show  at  the  Delaware  State  Fair  one 
year  for  singing  his  original  composi- 
tion while  accompanying  himself  on 
the  piano. 


"There's  not  a  kid  I  can't  handle," 
says  Reese.  "If  they  come  in  with  a 
chip  on  their  shoulder,  they  leave  with- 
out one.  These  kids  know  we  care  for 
them.  Even  if  I  holler  at  them,  they 
know  it's  because  I  care." 

Suzanne  Burnette,  summer  food  di- 
rector for  New  Castle  County,  says  the 
program  started  1 5  years  ago  serving 
lunch  only  to  the  JTPA  youth  at  work 
sites  and  then  branched  out  into  the 
communities  where  there  were  many 
children  needing  meals. 

"Open  sites"  serving  the  free  meals 
are  set  up  in  communities  where  50 
percent  of  the  students  receive  free  or 
reduced-priced  lunches  during  the 
school  year.  At  other  sites,  eligible  chil- 
dren are  enrolled  in  the  program;  eligi- 
bility is  determined  primarily  by 
household  income. 

Parents  sometimes 
help  supervise 

Burnette  prefers  to  do  outreach  in 
communities  that  are  most  disadvan- 
taged. She  also  tries  to  have  parents 
within  the  community  volunteer  their 
time  to  supervise  at  the  sites. 

That  goes  for  grandparents,  too.  For 
example,  last  summer  at  Brookmont 
Farms,  "Mother  Mary"  Shockley,  a 
grandmother  whom  all  the  children 
know  and  respect,  volunteered  to 
watch  over  the  kids  while  lunch  was 
served.  She  says  she  enjoyed  her  work 
and  would  like  to  do  it  again  this  year. 

At  many  New  Castle  sites,  a 
variety  of  activities — such  as  story 
reading,  sports,  and  arts  and  crafts — 
give  the  children  a  chance  to  learn 
some  new  things. 

Helping  with  summer  meals  is  also  a 
learning  experience  for  the  teens.  "This 
is  the  first  job  for  most  of  the  kids,"  says 
Nancy  Ford,  state  specialist  with  the 
Summer  Food  Service  Program. 
"These  kids  are  important,  and  the  pro- 
gram keeps  them  off  the  streets." 

Food  for  children,  jobs  for  teens.  In 
New  Castle,  Delaware,  it's  a  winning 
combination.

Working  To  Heal  As  Well  As  Shelter 


Boston 's  Pine  Street  Inn 
Is  Beacon  Of  Hope  To  Many 


JTJ.OW  are  you  today,  Mr.  Jones?" 

Conversation.  Simple,  courteous, 
and  humane.  A  welcome  respite  from 
the  isolation  of  life  on  the  streets. 

Staff  and  volunteers  at  the  Pine 
Street  Inn  in  Boston,  Massachusetts, 
greet  homeless  men  and  women  by 
name.  They  know  that  as  much  as  their 
"guests"  need  shelter,  they  also  need 
respect,  kindness,  and  a  basic  affirma- 
tion of  their  individual  worth  and 
dignity. 

The  Inn,  a  converted  firehouse,  is 
easily  recognized  by  its  brightly  lit 
tower  beckoning  the  city's  homeless  to 
safety  and  shelter. 

Meals  and  other 
services  provided 

An  emergency  shelter  run  by  a  pri- 
vate nonprofit  organization,  the  Pine 
Street  Inn  and  its  satellites  provide  880 
beds  every  night  for  single  adult  men 
and  women.  Largely  through  the  sup- 
port of  its  volunteers,  the  Inn  also 
serves  two  meals  a  day,  7  days  a  week, 
to  more  than  1 ,600  persons. 


More  than  1 20  volunteer  groups  do- 
nate or  help  with  meals.  Food  help  also 
comes  from  USDA's  Food  Distribution 
Program,  which  provides  approxi- 
mately $2,000  worth  of  staple  com- 
modities each  month. 

In  addition  to  food  and  shelter,  Pine 
Street  has  an  on-site  clinic  to  tend  to 
immediate  health  needs  and  assist 
with  medical  or  psychiatric  referrals. 
The  Inn  also  provides  clothing  (primar- 
ily donated)  5  days  a  week  to  approxi- 
mately 370  men  and  women  per  day. 

The  road  back  from  homelessness  is 
a  hard  one.  Sheltering  is  only  a  part  of 
the  solution,  says  John  Rood,  commu- 
nity relations  associate  for  Pine  Street. 
"Our  whole  focus  is  to  get  people  out  of 
this  mode  of  coming  in  here  to  a  virtual 
warehouse  and  sleeping.  What  we  are 
looking  to  do  is  create  smaller  transi- 
tional programs  aimed  at  specific 
groups." 

The  homeless  population  is  varied — 
ranging  from  formerly  institutionalized 


mentally  ill  men  and  women  to  mothers 
and  children  forced  out  of  homes  and 
apartments  because  of  rising  rents  or 
personal  crises  such  as  divorce,  loss 
of  job,  or  illness. 

Pine  Street  has  put  into  place  three 
programs  to  reach  homeless  people 
with  various  needs.  They  are:  the  work 
rehabilitation  program;  the  permanent 
housing  program;  and  Pine  Street's 
newest  program — Celeste  House  for 
women  and  children.  FNS  programs 
play  a  supportive  role  in  each. 

Beginning  the 
transition  to  housing 

The  work  rehabilitation  effort  is 
called  the  Live-In  Staff  Program.  It  cur- 
rently serves  approximately  40  men 
and  1 5  women,  most  of  whom  have  a 
long  history  of  substance  abuse  or 
mental  illness. 

Pine  Street's  tower  (left  of  the  tallest  sky- 
scraper) shines  brightly  in  the  night. 


"The  program  gives  them  a  chance 
to  reverse  the  circumstances  that 
brought  them  to  the  shelter,"  says  Rood. 
"It  is  the  first  step  in  the  transitional 
process  of  going  from  the  shelter  envi- 
ronment to  permanent  housing." 

Placement  in  the  program  is  done  on 
an  individual  basis,  and  work  assign- 
ments are  individually  paced  according 
to  ability.  Typical  work  assignments  in- 
clude making  beds,  serving  meals,  and 
cleaning.  In  exchange,  Pine  Street  pro- 
vides a  room,  meals,  an  hourly  stipend, 
and  counseling  to  help  participants 
with  addictions  or  mental  illness. 

Also  helpful  are  referrals  to  other 
work  programs,  such  as  the  Food 
Stamp  Employment  and  Training  Pro- 
gram (approximately  43  referrals  are 
made  to  this  program  each  year),  and 
information  on  other  sources  of  food 
help  and  social  services. 

Says  one  former  Live- In  staff  person 
who  has  since  found  a  job  and  a  home 
outside  the  Inn:  "The  Live-In  Program 
enabled  me  to  regain  some  of  my  self- 
esteem.  It  gave  me  hope  that  every- 
thing wasn't  over." 

Permanent  residence 
helpful  to  many 

The  Paul  Sullivan  Housing  Trust, 
named  in  memory  of  the  Inn's  former 
executive  director,  was  established  in 
1 983.  The  goal  of  the  program  is  to 
provide  a  stable,  permanent  residence 
for  single  men  and  women  of  limited 
means.  Currently  the  Inn  has  about  80 
units  and  hopes  to  have  about  1 50  by 
the  end  of  the  year. 


Mothers  and  children,  as  well  as  single  adult  men  and  women, 
benefit  from  services  provided  by  the  Pine  Street  Inn.  More  than 
120  volunteer  groups  and  individual  volunteers,  such  as  this 
elderly  man  (right),  donate  food  for  meals  or  help  serve  them. 
Pine  Street 's  kitchen  staff  (below)  have  a  busy  schedule. 
The  Inn  serves  two  meals  a  day  to  more  than  1,600  people.

her  until  both  agree  that  the  transition 
from  shelter  to  permanent  housing  has 
been  completed.  For  many,  this  proc- 
ess requires  several  months  of  reg- 
ular visits. 

The  Pine  Street  staff  feel  this  sup- 
port helps  ensure  that  placements  will 
be  truly  permanent,  instead  of  having 
people  reappear  in  the  shelter  system 
after  living  awhile  on  their  own. 

People  who  are  placed  in  permanent 
housing  are  required  to  contribute  one- 
fourth  of  their  income  whether  it  be 
from  employment  wages  or  veteran  or 
disability  benefits  they  receive.  The 
counselors  often  help  residents  secure 
furniture,  kitchen  equipment,  linens, 
and  a  supply  of  food  through  the  Pine 
Street's  network  of  donors.  They  also 
help  residents  transport  everything  on 
moving  day. 

The  residence  has  live-in  managers. 
Additional  staff  come  in  during  the  day 
to  provide  counseling;  help  with  refer- 
rals to  social  service  agencies,  such  as 
the  local  food  stamp  office;  and  make 
sure  residents  have  transportation  to 
appointments. 

"We  maintain  communication  with 
people  in  permanent  housing  for  an  in- 
definite period  on  an  individual  basis," 
says  Rood.  "The  successes  we  have 
had  with  this  program  let  us  know  we 
are  on  the  right  track. 

"One  man  in  particular  comes  to 
mind.  He  was  the  typical,  disheveled, 
downcast  homeless  guest  in  the  shel- 
ter. He  was  able  to  make  the  transition, 
and  now  he  is  in  permanent  housing. 
When  you  go  to  see  him  now,  you  are 
his  guest.  That  is  why  we  are  here." 

Women  and  children 
get  special  care 

Recognizing  the  special  needs  of 
homeless  women  and  children,  Pine 
Street  opened  the  Celeste  House  in 
May  1 989.  The  Celeste  House  offers  a 
2-year  comprehensive  program  of  sup- 
portive transitional  housing  and  serv- 
ices for  women  and  their  children. 

The  women  in  this  program  are 
chronic  substance  abusers.  "Our  ef- 
forts are  to  help  these  women  turn  their 
lives  around  and  become  self-sufficient 
so  they  will  be  capable  of  supporting 
themselves  and  caring  for  their  chil- 
dren," says  Blaise  Flynn,  administrator 
of  Celeste  House. 

The  house,  provided  by  the  Domini- 
can Sisters,  has  accommodations  for 
1 2  women  and  their  children.  It  is  set 


up  to  offer  a  wide  range  of  educational 
and  supportive  services  within  a 
shared  living  context. 

The  women  have  their  own  rooms 
and  share  a  kitchen.  There  is  also  a 
nursery  and  a  school  area  where  the 
women  can  study  for  the  GED  (General 
Equivalency  Diploma  from  high  school) 
and  learn  word  processing. 

The  24-hour  staff  coverage  allows 
the  women  to  live  with  their  children  in 
a  safe  and  nurturing  environment.  Ac- 
tivities and  supportive  services — such 
as  career  counseling,  tutoring,  Alco- 
holics/Narcotics Anonymous,  parent 
training,  and  recreation — help  them  re- 
build their  lives. 

Since  the  women  in  the  program  are 
recovering  from  substance  abuse,  they 
have  special  nutrition  needs,  which  are 
addressed.  Proper  diet  is  emphasized. 
USDA's  WIC  program  plays  a  key  role 
here  since  all  of  the  women  are  either 
participating  in  WIC  themselves  or 
have  children  who  are  participating. 

"We  hope  to  be  able  to  give  these 
women  the  skills  they  will  need  to  live 
full  and  productive  lives,"  says  Rood. 
"We  won't  know  how  successful  we've 
been  until  the  first  woman  is  ready  to 
leave  the  program,  and  that  won't  be 
for  a  while." 

Working  to  heal 
as  well  as  shelter 

"We  have  success  stories,  but  not  as 
many  as  we  would  like  given  the  tre- 
mendous magnitude  of  the  homeless," 
he  adds.  "We  are  continually  chal- 
lenged to  develop  programs  that  not 
only  meet  the  needs  of  the  homeless 
but  also  help  heal  them. 

"We  believe  the  solution  lies  in  more 
specialized  programs;  increased  gov- 
ernment assistance  and  affordable 
housing  for  the  working  poor;  commu- 
nity-based residential  programs  for 
those  with  special  needs;  and  in  soci- 
ety's education  of  the  realities  of  the 
homeless,"  says  Rood. 

"And  that  all  begins  with  the  basic 
knowledge  that  the  homeless  are  not 
'the  homeless'  but  people  who  don't 
have  homes."

Boosting  Kids'  Chances  Of  Going  On  To  School 


Virginia  Day  Care  Center 
Gives  Children  Of  Migrant 
Farmworkers  A  Head  Start 


Irma  Guel  never  was  a  teenager.  She 
became  an  adult  at  1 5  when  she  mar- 
ried and  had  a  child.  You  grow  up  fast 
in  a  migrant  camp. 

"My  first  baby  was  only  5  months  old 
when  I  got  pregnant  with  my  second 
one,"  Guel  says.  "I  had  a  hard  time  rais- 
ing both  of  them.  They  might  as  well 
have  been  twins." 

Guel,  23,  her  husband,  and  their 
three  children  make  a  yearly  round  trip 
from  Florida  to  Virginia  with  their  Mexi- 
can-American families  to  plant  and 
harvest  crops  such  as  tomatoes  and 
green  beans.  For  these  migrant  farm- 
workers, wages  are  minimal,  particu- 


larly if  the  weather  is  inclement. 
Possessions  are  few,  and  many  work- 
ers are  undereducated. 

Seeking  more  for 
their  children 

Improving  their  lives  hasn't  been 
easy  for  the  Guels  because  of  the  ram- 
ifications of  trying  to  break  away  from  a 
lifestyle  that's  been  passed  from  gen- 
eration to  generation. 

But  thanks  to  a  Virginia  day  care 
center  where  two  federal  programs  join 
forces,  the  Guels  are  hopeful  for  a  bet- 
ter life. 

It's  at  the  Parksley  Migrant  Head 


Start  Center,  on  the  70-mile  peninsula 
known  as  Virginia's  Eastern  Shore, 
that  the  two  oldest  Guel  children  re- 
ceived a  special  kind  of  guidance  to 
prepare  them  for  school. 

Their  2-year-old  brother  is  now  at- 
tending the  facility,  which  provides  edu- 
cation, health  care,  and  social  activ- 
ities to  low-income  children  through 
the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and 
Human  Services'  Head  Start  Program 
and  nutritious  meals  through  USDA's 
Child  Care  Food  Program. 

Coincidentally,  Irma  landed  a  job 
2  years  ago  as  an  interpreter  at  the 
center,  which  serves  a  predominantly 


Spanish-speaking  population.  This 
seasonal  position  in  Virginia  allows  her 
to  spend  6  months  out  of  the  year 
closer  to  her  children. 

"At  least  one  parent  needs  to  get  out 
of  the  fields  to  teach  the  children  that 
there's  something  better  out  there," 
she  says. 

The  center  has  had  a  positive  effect 
not  only  on  Irma  but  on  her  children  as 
well.  "I  feel  good  about  leaving  my  child 
here,"  she  says.  "My  baby  is  really  too 
young  to  talk,  but  I  think  he  likes  it 
here.  If  he  didn't,  he  wouldn't  be  too 
ready  to  get  on  the  bus  in  the  morning." 

Irma  says  her  son  looks  forward  to 
mealtime  at  the  center.  The  menus  for 
breakfast  and  lunch  follow  federal 
guidelines  to  meet  the  nutritional  needs 
of  the  children  who  attend  the  center. 

Arts  and  crafts  and  food  are  not  the 
only  things  the  center  has  to  ease  a 
young  parent's  mind. 

"I  know  there's  always  a  nurse  here," 
Irma  says.  "If  my  child  needs  some 
kind  of  medication  or  needs  to  be  seen 
by  a  doctor,  they  always  take  care  of  it. 
I  can  go  to  work  and  know  he  is  all 
right.  Where  else  can  I  leave  him  un- 
less I  pay  for  a  babysitter?  And  I  can't 
afford  that. 

"I  think  a  lot  of  parents  feel  more 
comfortable  leaving  their  children  here 
at  the  day  care  center." 

"Home  away  from 
home"  for  100  kids 

Open  from  6  a.m.  to  6  p.m.,  Monday 
through  Friday,  the  Parksley  Migrant 
Head  Start  Center  is  a  "home  away 
from  home"  for  some  1 00  kids. 

A  tall,  old  sycamore  shades  the  Park- 
sley Center's  playground,  where  tod- 
dlers riding  red  and  green  scooters 
mimic  truck  sounds.  Inside,  infants 
sleep  in  cribs;  a  caregiver  cradles  one 
of  them  as  though  he  were  her  own. 
Large  letters  made  from  blue  construc- 
tion paper  read,  "A  baby  needs  hugs, 
kisses,  cuddling,  and  most  of  all  love." 
In  another  room,  some  wide-eyed  pre- 
schoolers sit  quietly,  as  a  teacher  reads 
one  of  their  favorite  stories. 
It's  close  to  lunchtime.  Elizabeth  and 
Daisey,  the  full-time  cooks,  have  a 
large  pot  of  homemade  tomato  and 
meat  sauce  simmering  on  the  six- 

At  Parksley,  a  variety  of  activities  help 
children  learn,  and  meals  are  no  exception. 
Staff  members  (left)  sit  with  the  children  while

burner  stove.  They're  cutting  up  fresh, 
locally  grown  carrots  for  the  tossed 
salad.  Pasta,  green  peas,  french 
bread,  and  milk  also  will  be  offered  to 
the  kids,  along  with  vanilla  pudding  for 
dessert. 

But,  things  weren't  always  so  idyllic. 

"Children  often  were  left  in  cars 
along  the  highway  or  in  baskets  in  the 
fields  while  their  parents  worked,"  says 
Myron  Miller,  migrant  Head  Start  direc- 
tor for  the  Virginia  Council  of  Churches 
(VCC),  which  operates  the  center. 
"There  was  a  need  to  have  children  in 
some  place  other  than  in  the  fields. 

"The  council,  an  organization  of  13 
major  church  groups  in  the  state,  be- 
gan a  ministry  with  migrant  farm- 
workers in  1 948  to  help  these  folks  who 
stayed  a  short  time  in  the  state  and 
lived  in  labor  camps  pretty  much  apart 
from  the  community.  Their  major  need 
was  day  care." 

The  VCC  has  a  long  history  of  help- 
ing migrant  children  at  the  Eastern 
Shore.  VCC  volunteers,  for  example, 
have  taught  reading  and  writing  in 
places  like  chapels  and  migrant 
camps,  which  often  weren't  large 
enough  and  had  no  running  water  ex- 
cept for  the  rain  that  came  in  through 
leaky  roofs.  Miller,  an  ordained  minis- 
ter, had  previously  been  involved  with 
the  migrant  population  in  Florida  when 
he  was  called  to  the  VCC  in  1 956. 

In  1 974,  VCC  joined  forces  with  East 
Coast  Migrant  Head  Start,  a  grantee 
agency  of  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Health  and  Human  Services.  The  cor- 
poration organizes  and  directs  Head 
Start  within  delegate  agencies.  East 
Coast  pays  for  the  installation  of 
plumbing,  for  example,  which  is  re- 
quired for  a  center  to  obtain  a  license 
to  operate. 

The  Parksley  facility,  two  other  local 
centers,  and  one  in  northern  Virginia 
built  with  VCC  funds,  also  operate  on 
state  monies  and  by  the  council's  in- 
kind  contributions.  They  serve  295  chil- 
dren yearly  through  the  Head  Start  and 
child  care  feeding  programs. 

Special  care  and 
food  mean  a  lot 

USDA's  Child  Care  Food  Program 
provides  a  nutritious  breakfast,  lunch, 
and  snack  each  day. 

Mealtime  is  not  just  a  "time  out,"  cen- 
ter director  Joyce  Petit-Dix  explains. 
It's  a  meaningful  social  experience  for 
the  kids,  who  often  don't  have  an  op- 
portunity to  make  a  lot  of  friends  be- 
cause they  relocate  so  frequently. 


Since  the  ratio  of  staff  to  children  is 
about  one-to-four,  the  kids  get  a  lot  of 
attention  at  lunchtime.  The  employees 
sit  and  talk  to  them  and  explain  why  the 
good  foods  they  get  at  the  center  are 
important  to  their  growth. 

Infants  8  weeks  old  to  children  up  to 
4  years  old  can  participate  in  the  pro- 
grams at  Parksley  from  June  into  No- 
vember. An  assessment,  educational 
profile,  and  lesson  plan  are  developed 
for  each.  Center  staff  are  specially 
trained  to  keep  track  of  the  youngsters' 
progress. 

"Ninety-nine  percent  of  the  time, 
they're  not  where  they're  supposed  to 
be,"  says  Petit-Dix.  "Sometimes  it 
might  be  because  of  a  physical  condi- 
tion. Once  we  take  care  of  those 
needs,  we  can  bring  them  to  where 
they  should  be  and  go  forward." 

The  children  get  constant  attention 
from  the  staff  of  64,  who  see  the  day 
care  facility  as  much  more  than  a  baby- 
sitting operation.  While  infants  are 
guided  through  basic  motor  skills,  tod- 
dlers listen  to  records  and  play  with  an 
abundance  of  toys.  Older  children 
watch  puppet  shows,  push  pee-wee 
size  shopping  carts  through  a  make- 
believe  grocery  store,  learn  songs, 
fingerpaint,  and  prepare  for  the  transi- 
tion to  public  school. 

An  outreach  worker  at  Parksley  en- 
rolls the  kids,  assesses  each  family's 
needs,  and  may  refer  them  to  other  pro- 


grams like  USDA's  Food  Stamp  Pro- 
gram and  WIC  (the  Special  Supple- 
mental Food  Program  for  Women, 
Infants,  and  Children). 

The  children  must  have  a  physical 
examination  and  be  immunized  before 
they  are  accepted  at  the  center.  Physi- 
cians from  a  Norfolk  hospital  check  the 
children  at  the  beginning  of  the  pro- 
gram. The  Delmarva  Rural  Ministries 
fills  in  afterwards. 

First  thing  each  day,  the  Parksley 
staff  dress  the  children  in  clothing  do- 
nated to  the  center,  to  save  wear  and 
tear  on  the  kids'  clothes.  They  record 
any  changes  they  notice,  such  as  the 
presence  of  lice,  scratches,  bites, 
runny  noses,  or  bruises.  Some  of  the 
children  get  baths  and  have  their 
clothes  laundered. 

If  a  child  needs  medical  attention,  a 
note  is  sent  to  the  parents  asking  them 
to  either  handle  the  problem  them- 
selves or  give  the  center  nurse  permis- 
sion to  make  an  appointment  for  the 
child.  Either  way,  the  child  cannot  re- 
turn to  the  center  until  he  or  she  is  well. 

The  Head  Start  facility  provides 
transportation  to  the  doctor  and  den- 
tist. But  first,  center  staff  may  have  to 
drive  around  in  the  fields. 

"We  don't  do  anything  to  anyone's 
child  without  the  parents  being  pres- 
ent," says  Petit-Dix.  "If  we  have  to  go 
into  the  fields  to  get  them,  we  will  do  so. 
We  have  an  understanding  with  the 


farmers.  If  children  are  sick,  they  won't 
be  allowed  in  the  center;  therefore, 
some  parents  are  going  to  be  home.  If 
we're  not  taking  care  of  their  kids,  how 
can  the  people  work?  The  farmers 
need  us." 

Helping  children 
go  on  to  school 

Health  and  scholastic  records  are 
forwarded  to  other  migrant  Head  Start 
centers  on  the  East  Coast.  It's  this  kind 
of  groundwork  that  is  building  the  kids' 
chances  to  go  on  to  school. 

"Traditionally,  migrant  kids  missed 
out  on  education,"  says  Miller.  "In  the 
early  years,  we  had  to  beg  the  parents 
to  let  us  take  their  children.  They  were 
reluctant  to  leave  them  with  strangers. 
They  seek  us  out  now. 

"The  center's  programs  have  made  a 
significant  improvement  in  the  lives  of 
the  children.  You  can  see  how  good 
food  and  a  clean  environment  make  a 
difference  in  just  a  few  weeks."

Making  Sure  Children  Get  What  They  Need 


Gila  River  Clinic  Reaches 
Out  To  WIC  Participants 
Needing  Extra  Care 


In  the  Gila  River  Indian  community  in 
Central  Arizona,  all  the  children  partici- 
pating in  WIC  need  the  help  the  pro- 
gram offers.  But  some  need  a  little 
more  and  get  it  because  of  a  new  clinic 
set  up  to  help  them  and  other  children 
in  the  community  with  some  very  de- 
manding health  problems. 

Gila  River,  about  an  hour's  drive 
south  of  Phoenix,  is  the  third  largest  In- 
dian community  in  the  United  States. 
It  is  home  to  more  than  1 0,000  people 
in  20  communities  scattered  across 
374,000  acres. 

Lynn  Rusch,  who  oversees  the  Gila 
River  WIC  program  as  director  of  Ma- 
ternal and  Child  Nutrition  Services, 
says  many  of  the  young  WIC  partici- 
pants have  multiple  problems  that  af- 
fect their  nutritional  status  as  well  as 
their  general  health. 

Some  of  the  common  problems 
Rusch  and  her  staff  see  include  low 
birth  weight,  "failure  to  thrive,"  cleft  lip 
or  palate,  cerebral  palsy,  fetal  alcohol 
syndrome,  and  severe  obesity  (1 50 
percent  or  more  of  ideal  weight). 

Many  of  the  children's  mothers  were 
diabetic  or  developed  gestational  dia- 
betes during  pregnancy,  and  some  of 
the  babies  have  associated  risks,  such 
as  birth  defects,  brain  damage, 
jaunice,  and  enlarged  heart. 

Coordination  with  local  health 
professionals  is  essential  to  providing 
full  care  to  these  children  and  their 
families. 

Variety  of  services 
offered  at  clinic 

Last  year,  Rusch  began  working  with 
staff  at  the  reservation's  new  Hu  Hu 
Kam  Memorial  Hospital  to  set  up  a 
clinic  especially  designed  for  children 
with  special  needs.  Begun  a  year  ago, 
it  is  called,  appropriately,  the  Special 
Needs  Clinic. 

"We  wanted  to  come  up  with  a  way  to 
make  it  as  easy  as  possible  to  provide 

22 


the  best  care  we  can,"  says  Dr.  Cindy 
Bowers,  a  staff  physician  at  Hu  Hu 
Kam  Hospital.  "We  also  wanted  to 
make  access  to  the  health  care  system 
easier." 

Working  as  a  team,  Dr.  Bowers,  Lynn 
Rusch,  and  Janet  Corelli,  assistant  di- 
rector of  public  health  nursing,  assess 
what  treatment  is  indicated  for  each 
child  referred  to  the  clinic  and  decide 
how  it  can  best  be  provided. 

Rusch,  a  registered  dietician  with  a 
nursing  background  as  well,  takes  re- 


sponsibility for  issues  related  to  diet 
and  nutrition.  She  works  closely  with 
the  hospital's  physicians  to  evaluate 
children's  feeding  plans  and  makes 
sure  their  nutrition  care  is  closely  coor- 
dinated with  the  rest  of  their  medical 
care. 

Sometimes,  a  child  may  need  to  see 
a  specialist  and  may  be  referred  to  the 
pediatrician  who  holds  a  clinic  at  the 
hospital  for  a  half  day  monthly,  or  to  the 
child  psychologist,  an  occupational 
therapist,  or  other  specialists. 


Food  and  Nutrition 


The  clinic's  staff  try  to  schedule  pa- 
tients' appointments  as  carefully  as 
possible  to  eliminate  extra  trips  for 
their  families.  Since  transportation  is 
sometimes  a  problem  on  the  reserva- 
tion, some  families  may  not  always 
come  in  if  they  have  to  make  too  many 
trips  to  the  hospital. 

Some  children  need  to  be  referred  to 
specialists  or  medical  facilities  outside 
the  reservation.  Many  go  to  Phoenix  to 
the  Indian  Medical  Center  or  Children's 
Rehabilitative  Services. 

Care  tailored 
to  each  child 

"Andy"  is  one  baby  who  started  out 
with  WIC  and  is  now  also  being  cared 
for  through  the  Special  Needs  Clinic. 

Andy's  mom  was  only  1 3  years  old 
when  he  was  born.  Although  the  baby 
appeared  healthy  at  birth,  a  para- 
professional  on  the  WIC  staff  noticed 
he  wasn't  breathing  normally  when  he 
came  in  for  his  2-month  appointment, 
and  noted  that  his  weight  gain  was  be- 
low normal.  She  referred  Andy  to 
Rusch,  who  scheduled  the  baby  for  an 
appointment  at  the  Special  Needs 
Clinic.

Phoenix  for  testing,  where  it  was  deter- 
mined that  he  had  cardiac  problems 
and  would  indeed  need  special  care. 

After  2  weeks  of  treatment,  he  came 
home,  and  the  team  from  the  Special 
Needs  Clinic  coordinated  with  the 
medical  staff  in  Phoenix  to  monitor  and 
reinforce  his  care.  Rusch  worked 
closely  with  Andy's  mother  to  carefully 
monitor  his  feeding  and  weight  gain, 
including  showing  her  how  to  mix  the 
formula  and  food  supplements  pre- 
scribed to  help  Andy  grow. 

Because  the  baby  was  at  high  risk, 
Rusch  saw  Andy  weekly,  either  at  the 
WIC  office  or  at  the  Special  Needs 
Clinic.  She  also  checked  on  him  be- 
tween office  visits.  When  Rusch  and 
her  staff  noticed  that  the  baby  was  still 
not  gaining  weight  in  spite  of  their  ef- 


forts, Dr.  Bowers  again  had  him  admit- 
ted to  Phoenix  for  evaluation. 

Andy's  heart  condition  had  wors- 
ened. He  spent  another  2  weeks  at  the 
hospital  in  Phoenix  while  the  staff  there 
stabilized  his  heart  condition  and 
weight  gain. 

Since  Andy  came  back  from  his  sec- 
ond trip,  his  mother  has  brought  him  to 
the  Special  Needs  Clinic  monthly,  and 
to  the  WIC  clinic  weekly  so  that  Rusch 
can  continue  to  closely  monitor  his 
progress.  "His  heart  works  so  hard,  he 
burns  up  all  the  calories  from  the  for- 
mula," Rusch  explains. 

WIC  provides 
special  formula 

WIC  provides  Andy's  special  for- 
mula, which  Rusch  says,  at  about  $1 3 
per  can,  the  family  couldn't  afford  on 
their  own.  To  help  Andy  gain  weight, 
doctors  have  added  an  easily  digested, 
high-calorie  oil  to  the  formula  and  sup- 
plements he  was  already  receiving. 

This  makes  preparing  Andy's  for- 
mula even  more  complex.  "Our  role  in 
showing  Andy's  mother  how  to  prepare 
the  formula  and  mix  it  with  the  supple- 
ments has  been  very  important,"  says 

23 


Rusch.  "It's  a  big  responsibility  for  a 
13-year-old." 

WIC's  role  in  identifying  nutrition 
problems  and  related  medical  problems 
is  also  very  important,  she  adds.  With- 
out WIC,  some  of  the  problems  spotted 
during  WIC  appointments  might  go 
undetected. 

After  each  clinic  visit,  the  staff  meets 
to  discuss  Andy's  treatment  and  prog- 
ress. They  keep  careful  records  to  as- 
sist medical  professionals  at  any 
facility  that  may  need  to  help  Andy  in 
the  future. 

In  addition,  they  share  information  on 
his  case  with  field  staff,  such  as  public 
health  nurses,  social  workers,  or  WIC 
staff  members  running  the  district  WIC 
clinics.  As  with  other  Special  Needs 
Clinic  patients,  they  help  follow  up  on 
Andy  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including 


home  visits.  Home  visits  offer  oppor- 
tunities to  work  with  members  of  the 
extended  family  to  provide  information 
and  support. 


Field  workers  also  help  keep  Bowers, 
Rusch,  and  Corelli  informed  about  the 
status  of  Andy's  case,  and  alert  them 
to  potential  problems.  This  is  espe- 
cially helpful  when  working  with  a  fam- 
ily living  in  an  area  without  phones. 

Until  there  is 
no  longer  a  need 

Once  a  child  is  seen  by  the  Special 
Needs  Clinic,  care  is  continued  until 
there  is  no  longer  a  need,  or  until  the 
child  outgrows  the  clinic. 

"Because  of  the  complexity  and  se- 
verity of  their  problems,  care  for  many 
of  these  kids  through  the  Special 
Needs  Clinic  will  continue  until  they 
pass  into  adulthood,"  says  Rusch. 

Twenty-seven  kids  have  been  seen 
through  the  clinic  since  it  was  set  up  a 
year  ago,  and  most  are  enrolled  in  the 
WIC  Program. 

The  Special  Needs  kids  take  a  lot  of 
Rusch's  time,  but  she  says  it's  worth  it. 
"These  babies  need  the  extra  care.  It 
would  be  a  shame  if  they  didn't  get  it."

Helping  Families  Whose  Lives  Have  Been  Torn  Apart 


When  Hurricane  Hugo 
Strikes,  Special  Efforts  Get 
Food  Through  To  St.  Croix 


Hurricane  Hugo  ravaged  St.  Croix 
with  near-tornado  force  winds  for  the 
better  part  of  1 2  hours  on  Sunday  night 
and  Monday  morning,  September  1 7 
and  18. 

Four  days  later,  heavy  rains  rico- 
cheted off  the  tarmac  at  the  St.  Croix 
airport.  It  was  3  a.m.,  Friday,  Septem- 
ber 22.  Strong  winds  from  the  sudden 
storm  began  to  unloosen  the  tarpaulin 
covering  pallets  of  USDA  commodities 
earmarked  for  the  island's  disaster 
victims. 

Just  as  the  tarps  began  to  billow, 
Jaime  Rivera  and  Angel  "Gabby" 
Matos,  from  the  Food  and  Nutrition 
Service's  Caribbean  area  office, 


sprinted  from  the  airport  terminal, 
across  the  runway.  They  scaled  the 
pallets  and,  in  turn,  forced  out  the  air 
pockets  and  retied  the  protective  cov- 
ering around  the  precious  cargo. 

It  took  them  nearly  3  hours  to  secure 
the  pallets.  Then,  exhausted,  drench- 
ed, and  arm-weary,  their  day  was  about 
to  begin. 

Welcome  to  the  world  of  disaster  re- 
lief— St.  Croix,  Virgin  Islands,  edition. 

"You  do  what 
needs  to  be  done" 

"You  do  what  needs  to  be  done,"  Riv- 
era, director  of  the  Caribbean  area  of- 
fice, said.  It  was  a  sentiment  often 


repeated  and  most  appropriate  for  the 
devastation  that  was  St.  Croix. 

When  it  was  all  done,  the  combined 
federal,  state,  local,  and  volunteer  food 
distribution  effort  resulted  in  more  than 
4  million  meals  for  St.  Croix  disaster 
victims.  There  was  an  abundance  of 
food  and  no  shortage  of  people  dedi- 
cated to  get  that  food  to  those  who  des- 
perately needed  it. 


"After  the  hurricane,"  said  volunteer 
Wayne  Kennedy,  "there  was  nothing. ..no 
power,  communications,  water ,  food... " 


That  first  night  when  Rivera  and 
Matos  secured  what  was  to  be  the  first 
of  some  4.3  million  pounds  of  USDA 
commodities  sent  by  air  and  sea  to 
St.  Croix,  the  two  had  been  sleeping 
on  cots  in  a  small  office  at  the  airport. 

They  had  arrived  that  day  from  their 
Puerto  Rico  homeland,  which  also  had 
been  ravaged  by  Hurricane  Hugo.  Both 
had  suffered  damage  to  their  homes. 
Rivera's  wife  had  just  delivered  their 
third  child,  and  Matos'  wife  was  in  her 
third  trimester. 

"It  was  not  good  timing,  that's  for 
sure,"  Matos  said.  "But  what  can  you 
do?  There  was  work  to  be  done." 

The  work  involved  setting  up  the 
movement  of  food  from  the  airstrip  to  a 
nearby  holding  area,  then  to  a  Virgin  Is- 
lands Department  of  Agriculture  ware- 
house and,  finally,  to  food  distribution 
sites  set  up  throughout  the  island. 

Coordination  with  the  Federal  Emer- 
gency Management  Agency  (FEMA), 
the  U.S.  Army's  18th  Airborne  unit,  the 
Virgin  Island  National  Guard,  and  the 
Red  Cross  helped  resolve  the  trans- 
portation problems.  The  FNS  area  of- 
fice staffers  had  the  network  opera- 
tional in  a  short  time. 

Rivera  and  Matos  were  joined  in  St. 
Croix  on  September  29  by  Steve  Rob- 
bins,  a  food  distribution  supervisor 
from  FNS'  Mid-Atlantic  regional  office. 
If  the  early  arrival  by  the  FNS  staff  from 
Puerto  Rico  was  responsible  for  jump 
starting  the  food  relief  effort  on  St. 
Croix,  it  was  Robbins  who  fine-tuned 
the  distribution  machine. 

Food  arrived 
by  air  and  sea 

As  food  shipments  began  arriving  in 
great  volume,  first  by  air  and  then  by 
sea,  vehicles  and  manpower  were  at  a 
premium.  Robbins'  3  weeks  on  St. 
Croix  were  a  whirlwind  of  meetings,  ne- 
gotiations, and  cajoling. 

When  food  wasn't  moving  fast 
enough,  it  was  not  unusual  to  see  Rob- 
bins join  an  aircraft  cargo  crew  to  pull 
pallets  to  the  unloading  doors,  drive  a 
21/2-ton  truck  loaded  with  commodities 
from  the  airstrip  to  the  nearby  mar- 
shalling area,  or  restack  pallets  that 
had  been  jostled  inadvertently  by  a  fork 
lift.  Robbins,  obviously,  was  another

regional  office  (right),  and  Virgin  Islands  com- 
modity supervisor  Winston  Saddler  make  sure 
boxes  of  food  are  ready  to  be  moved  to  the 
main  distribution  center.

who  had  that  "do  what  needs  to  be 
done"  attitude. 

"It's  amazing.  You  work  1 6  to  1 8 
hours  a  day  and  you  feel  disappointed 
that  there's  not  enough  time,"  he  said. 
"Sundays  are  just  like  any  other  day.  In 
fact,  at  the  FEMA  disaster  assistance 
center,  someone  posted  the  day  of  the 
week  on  the  bulletin  board  each  morn- 
ing. You  just  didn't  know  what  day  it 
was  because  it  was  irrelevant." 

The  long  hours  and  hard  work 
brought  results.  The  4.3  million  pounds 
of  USDA  food  were  brought  from  the 
airstrips  and  docks  to  the  central  ware- 
house first  by  the  U.S.  Army,  then  by 
private  contractors.  The  Virgin  Islands 
National  Guard  and  the  Red  Cross 
took  care  of  the  transportation  to 
scores  of  sites,  where  local  volunteers 
prepared  meal  packages  from  the  23 
different  kinds  of  commodities  to  dis- 
tribute to  friends  and  neighbors. 

The  effort  paid  off  to  the  thousands 

28 


of  St.  Croix  residents  who  fell  victim  to 
Hurricane  Hugo.  And,  Robbins  said, 
there  was  a  great  deal  of  personal 
satisfaction. 

"When  you  go  to  a  feeding  site  and 
you  see  the  food  that  you've  been  kill- 
ing yourself  to  get  out  there,  and  you 
see  the  smiles  on  people's  faces,  that 
says  it  all.  And  that's  the  difference  be- 
tween working  a  disaster  situation  and 
a  normal  nine-to-five  job.  That's  what 
makes  it  all  worthwhile  ultimately,  and 
it's  a  beautiful  experience." 

The  FNS  crew  gained  support  in 
their  efforts  with  the  arrival  on  Septem- 
ber 23  of  Winston  Saddler,  commodity 
supervisor  with  the  Virgin  Islands  De- 
partment of  Education.  His  knowledge 
of  St.  Croix  as  well  as  the  business  of 
food  distribution  was  of  immeasurable 
help  in  dispersing  food  throughout 
the  island. 

"Without  Winston,  the  whole  opera- 
tion could  have  bogged  down,"  Rivera 


said.  "He  kept  us  rolling,  especially  in 
dealing  with  local  government  officials." 

Saddler  left  his  home  on  St.  Thomas 
and  travelled  4  hours  on  a  barge  to  St. 
Croix,  some  40  miles  away.  He  had  a 
few  things  in  an  overnight  bag  that 
served  as  his  dresser  and  pillow  for 
nearly  3  weeks.  He  slept  on  cots  and 
chairs  under  leaking  roofs  and  without 
electricity  and  water. 

Rewards  outweighed 
the  discomforts 

For  Saddler,  who  spent  whatever  free 
time  he  could  find  driving  around  the  is- 
land to  make  sure  all  food  distribution 
sites  and  the  people  who  came  there 
were  receiving  commodities,  the  re- 
wards were  simple  ones  that  far  out- 
weighed the  discomforts. 

"There  were  so  many  of  my  people 
who  had  nothing.  I  couldn't  believe  it.  It 
was  very  sad  at  first,"  he  said.  "But  we 
made  a  difference  to  a  lot  of  people  who 

Food  and  Nutrition 


were  really  in  need.  That  meant  a  great 
deal  to  me. 

"I'll  never  forget  what  I  saw  there, 
both  in  terms  of  what  happened  be- 
cause of  the  hurricane  and  what  we 
were  able  to  accomplish  to  help  the 
people.  Everyone  worked  so  hard.  I 
won't  forget  them  either." 

As  food  moved  from  port  to  ware- 
house to  distribution  site  to  homes, 
there  were  many  players  who  gave  self- 
lessly  and  silently.  Mary  Bowen,  head 
of  the  Red  Cross  operation  on  St. 
Croix,  said,  "You  couldn't  pay  people 
for  the  kind  of  dedication  we've  seen." 

Wayne  Kennedy  and  George  Kinder 
teamed  up  as  Red  Cross  volunteers 
whose  mission  was  to  troubleshoot  at 
the  distribution  sites  on  the  western 
part  of  the  island.  They  would  be  on  the 
go  from  sunup  to  well  after  sundown 
transporting  other  volunteers  to  and 
from  the  sites,  checking  on  the  availa- 
bility of  food,  and  providing  information 
to  Red  Cross  operations  headquarters. 

Kennedy,  a  Los  Angeles  resident,  op- 
erates his  own  construction  business. 
When  Hurricane  Hugo  swept  through 
the  Virgin  Islands,  he  dropped  a 
$40,000  construction  contract  and 
signed  on  with  the  Red  Cross  to  help  in 
the  disaster  effort. 

"I  felt  this  is  where  I  had  to  be,"  Ken- 
nedy said.  "Work  will  be  there  when  I 
get  back." 

Hugo  is  his  fourth  disaster  volunteer 
effort  with  Red  Cross  but  "definitely  the 
most  devastating"  in  terms  of  destruc- 
tion and  hardship  on  those  affected. 

"This  should  be  the  case  study  from 
which  all  disaster  relief  personnel 
should  be  trained,"  Kennedy  said,  "be- 
cause whatever  could  go  wrong  did  go 
wrong.  After  the  hurricane,  there  was 
nothing — no  power,  communications, 
water,  food — and  no  immediate  re- 
sources from  which  to  draw  support."

Volunteers  helped 
despite  own  losses 

Kennedy's  partner,  George  Kinder, 
didn't  have  to  travel  as  far  to  be  a  Red 
Cross  volunteer.  Kinder  retired  from 
the  Air  Force  7  years  ago  and  bought  a 
small  home  on  St.  Croix. 

The  house  was  destroyed  in  the  hur- 
ricane. But  whatever  sadness  or  dejec- 
tion he  felt  was  hidden  behind  a  con- 
stant smile  as  he  described  his  volun- 
teer assignment. 

"My  wife  and  I  weren't  hurt.  We're 
staying  with  friends,  and  there's  noth- 
ing I  can  do  about  the  house  right  now," 
Kinder  explained.  "So,  I  thought  I'd 
come  over  to  Red  Cross  to  see  if  I 
could  help.  Wayne  and  I  have  been  on 
the  go  ever  since." 

Like  Kinder,  there  were  many  people 
from  St.  Croix  who  set  aside  personal 
tragedies  to  help  in  the  relief  effort. 
Teachers,  especially,  were  at  their 
closed  schools  helping  dispense  food 
packages  to  families. 

And,  there  was  Iris  Medina,  a  school 
cafeteria  worker  at  the  Eulalie  Rivera 
Elementary  School  in  the  Grove  sec- 
tion of  St.  Croix.  Her  house  was  com- 
pletely destroyed  by  the  hurricane,  and 
she  was  forced  to  move  in  with  family 
in  a  nearby  community. 

Every  day  following  the  hurricane, 
she  walked  the  2  miles  to  and  from  the 
school,  which  was  turned  into  a  disas- 
ter and  feeding  center,  to  help  prepare 
meals  for  people  seeking  help. 

"We  were  able  to  use  some  of  the 
food  at  the  school  along  with  some  of 
the  food  that  has  come  since,"  she 
said.  "Everyone  has  been  helping." 

Medina  described  her  experience 
during  the  hurricane  as  waiting  out  the 
initial  part  of  the  storm,  then  racing  with 
many  others  during  the  eye  of  the  hurri- 
cane to  get  to  the  school.  "There  were 
people  running  from  all  over,  mothers 
with  children,  trying  to  get  to  the 
school,"  she  said. 

Meals  provided 
almost  immediately 

Despite  losing  a  large  part  of  the 
roof  that  covered  the  school's  kitchen, 
Medina  said  she  and  other  members  of 
the  cafeteria  staff  were  able  to  provide 
immediate  meal  service. 

"Even  though  many  people  lost 
everything  in  the  storm,  they  were  here 
from  day  one  serving  the  meals  from 
what  we  had  in  the  school — some 
USDA  meat,  fruit,  and  a  lot  of  peanut 
butter,"  she  said.  "We  gave  the  peanut 
butter  to  the  kids  and  reminded  them 
how  nutritious  it  was."

Emergency  shipments  of  canned  pork, 
vegetarian  beans,  and  orange  juice  were  the 
first  USDA  commodities  to  arrive  on  the 
island  of  St.  Croix  following  the  storm.

With  school  closed  indefinitely, 
Medina  expressed  her  concern  for  the 
children,  a  universal  sentiment  of 
school  food  service  workers. 

"We  are  worrying  about  the  kids,"  she 
said.  "We  want  them  back  in  school."
