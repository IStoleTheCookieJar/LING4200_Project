ABSTRACT 

A  pot  experiment  was  conducted  on  saline  soil  of  Sonagazi,  Bangladesh  to  determine  the  effect  of  different  levels 
of  salinity,  gypsum  and  rice-hull  on  soil  properties  under  wheat  culture.  pH  value  of  soil  slightly  increase  with  the  increase 
of  salinity.  EC  value  of  soil  significantly  (p  <  0.05)  increased  with  application  of  saline  water  but  decreased  with  the 
application  of  gypsum  and  rice  hull  alone  or  in  combination.  Available  nitrogen  content  16.18%  and  phosphorous  content 
19.23%  increased  in  soil  at  maturity  stage  with  increase  level  of  salinity,  but  available  sulfur  content  18.33%  decrease  with 
the  increase  level  of  salinity  as  compared  with  control.

INTRODUCTION 

The  availability  of  land  for  growing  crops  in  Bangladesh  is  limited.  This  requires  the  utilization  of  marginal  and 
problem  soils  and  improvement  of  yield  potentiality  of  wheat  per  unit  of  land  where  soil  stresses  of  different  kinds  and 
degrees  exist.  Problem  soil  offer  great  opportunity  in  this  regard(l).  The  problem  of  salinity  is  spreading  all  over  the  globe. 
Bangladesh  is  not  free  from  this  threat  as  the  saline  zones  are  creeping  outwardly.  Salinity  covers  about  one-fifth  of  the 
total  area  (26,000  km2)  of  Bangladesh  which  lies  around  the  northern  apex  of  the  Bay  of  Bengal'2'.  In  Bangladesh,  the 
saline  soils  have  the  potential  of  contributing  substantially  to  increase  wheat  production.  Among  the  factors  that  influence 
vertical  expansion  in  food  production,  the  use  of  inorganic  fertilizers,  and  soil  amending  materials  deserves  special 
attention.  Gypsum  increases  yield  and  acts  as  an  amending  material  of  saline  soil(3>.  Many  research  reported  that  the 
application  of  saline  water  with  gypsum  increased  the  removal  of  Na  from  the  soil  profile,  appreciably  decreased  the  soil 
pH,  improved  water  infiltration  rate  and  raised  crop  yield(4).  Rice  hull  also  improved  water  holding  capacity  of  soil. 
It  also  increased  organic  matter  content  of  the  soil  and  subsequently  increased  crop  yield.  The  present  investigation 
therefore  is  an  attempt  to  study  the  dynamics  of  physic-chemical  characteristics  of  coastal  saline  soil  under  wheat  as 
influenced  by  gypsum  and  rice-hull. 

METHODS 

A  pot  experiment  was  conducted  with  BARI-20  (Gourave)  high  yielding  wheat  cultivar.  The  soils  used  in  the 
experiment  representing  plough  layer  depth  (0-15  cm)  were  collected  from  Sonagazi  thana  of  Feni.  One  kg  of  soil  sample 
was  kept  in  the  plastic  container  for  chemical  analysis.  The  physical  and  chemical  characteristics  of  the  soils  were 
determined  by  following  standard  methods  and  the  results  are  presented  in  the  Table  1 .  As  a  basal  dose  half  of  Urea  and 
TSP  fertilizers  were  mixed  with  the  soil  of  each  pot  as  respectively  240  kg  ha"1  and  450  kg  ha"1.  After  sowing  the  wheat

seeds  soils  were  irrigated  with  tap  water  by  sprinkler  process  when  required.  Weeding  was  done  after  15  days  of  seedling. 
Another  half  of  Urea  and  TSP  were  given  in  the  pot  on  that  day.  Irrigation  with  saline  water  started  after  55  days  of 
seedling.  Each  pot  required  300  ml  of  saline  water.  Growth  parameter-Plant  heights  were  collected  at  three  stages  of  the 
plant  growth  -early  stage  (15  days  after  seedling),  middle  stage  (55  days  after  seedling)  and  maturity  stage 
(100  days  after  seedling).  Soil  samples  were  also  collected  in  polythene  bags  for  analyzing  nutrient  elements.

RESULTS  AND  DISCUTIONS 
Soil  pH 

The  pH  of  all  the  soils  were  examined  and  presented  in  table3.  There  was  slightly  changes  in  soil  pH  at  different 
stage  of  crop  growth.  Soil  pH  value  increased  with  the  saline  water  irrigation.  The  highest  value  of  pH  was  found  8.3  in 
T3  (EC12G0)  and  lowest  value  was  found  7.2  in  T7  (EC0G30o)  after  harvest  (table  3).  Soil  pH  decreased  slightly  with  the 
application  of  gypsum  and  rice-hull.  Soil  pH  decreased  more  with  gypsum  at  the  rate  of  300  kg  ha"1  than  gypsum  at  the  rate 
of  200  kg  ha"1.  The  combined  application  of  gypsum  200  kg  ha"1  with  rice-hull  4  or  8  t  ha"1  are  more  effective  to  reduce  soil 
pH  than  the  combined  application  of  gypsum  300  kg  ha"1  with  rice-hull  4  or  8  t  ha"1.  Al  most  similar  results  were  reported 
by  several  scientists.  Ahmed  et  al,  1983  observed  higher  pH  values  of  saline  water  irrigated  soil(8). 
Ahmed  and  Rahman  (1986)  reported  that  the  application  of  gypsum  in  saline  soil  decreased  the  pH  of  the  soil(9). 

Electrical  Conductivity 

The  electrical  conductivity  of  soil  (EC,,)  significantly  (p<  0.05)  increased  with  the  increase  of  salinity  of  irrigation 
water  and  marked  increased  was  observed  with  the  highest  salinity  level  (12  mS  cm"1).  With  the  advent  of  plant  growth, 
ECe  value  slightly  decreased  at  earlier  stage  and  finally  increased  (table  3).  After  harvest  the  maximum  value  of  soil  ECe 
was  found  5.4  mS  cm"1  in  T3  (EC12G0)  and  minimum  value  was  found  4.0  mS  cm"1  in  T7  (EC0G30o)  (table  3). 
Soil  EC  value  decreased  highly  with  the  application  of  gypsum  at  the  rate  of  300  kg  ha"1  than  gypsum  200  kg  ha"1. 
The  combined  application  of  gypsum  at  the  rate  of  300  kg  ha"1  and  rice-hull  (4  t  ha"1  and  8  t  ha"1)  decreased  ECe  value  more 
than  the  combined  application  of  gypsum  at  the  rate  of  200  kg  ha"1  and  rice-  hull  (4  t  ha"1  and  8  t  ha"1).  Kumar  et  al,  (1984) 
reported  that  the  EC  of  the  soil  increased  with  the  EC  of  irrigation  water(10).  The  present  results  are  partially  well  with  the 
findings  of  Khan  et  al.,  (1996).  Khan  et  al,  reported  that  the  EC  value  of  soil  decreased  with  the  higher  dose  of  gypsum 
added  in  the  soil(11).

EC0,  EC6,  EC12  represent  salinity  level  0,  6,  12  mS  cm"  . 
Go,  G2oo>  G300  represent  0,  200,  300  kg  ha"1  gypsum. 
H0,  H4,  H8  represent  0,  4,  8  t  ha"1  rice  hull. 


Available  Nitrogen 

Available  nitrogen  content  in  the  soil  increased  with  increased  level  of  salinity,  which  indicates  uptake  of  nitrogen 
decreased  with  the  increased  salinity  (Figure  1).  On  the  other  hand,  available  nitrogen  content  in  soil  decreased  with  the 
addition  of  gypsum  and  rice  hull,  which  might  be  due  to  better  growth  of  plants.  The  maximum  value  77  mg  kg"1  was 
found  in  T12  (ECi2H4)  and  minimum  value  20  mg  kg"1  was  found  in  T25  (EC0G30oH8)  at  the  maturity  stage  which  is 
64.914%  less  as  compared  with  control  T,  (EC0G0).  Gypsum  at  the  rate  of  300  kg  ha"1  was  more  effective  in  the  case  of 
decreasing  available  nitrogen  content  in  the  soil.  Rice-hull  of  8  t  ha"1  was  also  more  effective  to  reduce  more  available 
nitrogen  content  than  4  t  ha"1  Within  the  combinations  of  rice-hull  and  gypsum,  rice-  hull  of  8  t  ha"1  with  gypsum  of 
300  kg  ha"1  was  more  effective  than  other  combinations  in  the  case  of  reducing  available  nitrogen  content  in  the  soil. 

Available  Phosphorous 

The  availability  of  phosphorous  in  soil  increased  with  the  increased  level  of  salinity  that  means  uptake  of 
phosphorous  decreased  with  the  increased  of  Salinity  (Figure  2).  With  the  addition  of  gypsum  and  rice-hull  decreased 
phosphorous  content  in  soil,  which  indicates  plant  uptake  increased.  The  maximum  value  4.24  mg  kg"1  was  found  in 
T3  (EC12G0)  and  the  minimum  value  3.60  mg  kg"1  was  found  in  T25  (EC0G30oH8)  at  the  maturity  stage  which  is  13.46%  less 
as  compared  with  control  T,  (EC0G0).  The  application  of  gypsum  at  the  rate  of  300  kg  ha"1  was  more  effective  to  reducing 
availability  of  phosphorous  in  soil  than  gypsum  at  the  rate  of  200  kg  ha"1.  Rice-hull  8  t  ha"1  was  also  more  effective  to 
reduce  available  phosphorous  in  soil  than  rice-hull  4  t  ha"1.  Among  all  the  combinations  of  rice-hull  and  gypsum, 
rice-  hull  8  t  ha"1  and  gypsum  300  kg  ha"  is  more  effective  to  reduce  available  phosphorous  in  soil.

Available  Sulfur 

The  maximum  value  of  available  sulfur  442  mg  kg"1  was  found  in  T7  (EC0G300)  and  minimum  value  107  mg  kg"1 
was  found  in  T24  (EC12G300H4)  at  the  maturity  stage  in  the  soil.  Availability  of  sulfur  content  in  soil  decrease  with  the 
increased  levels  of  salinity,  that  means  uptake  of  sulfur  increase  with  the  increased  levels  of  salinity  (Figure  3). 
On  the  other  hand,  available  sulfur  content  increased  with  the  addition  of  gypsum  and  rice-hull  that  indicate  plant  uptake 
decreased.  Gypsum  dose  300  kg  ha"1  alone  and  rice-hull  dose  8  t  ha"1  alone  was  more  effective  than  any  other  dose. 
Within  the  combinations  of  rice-hull  and  gypsum,  rice-hull  4  t  ha"1  with  gypsum  200  kg  ha"1  was  more  effective  than  other 
combinations  in  the  case  of  increasing  available  sulfur  content  in  the  soil. 

CONCLUSIONS 

The  findings  suggest  that  the  application  of  gypsum  and  rice-hull  on  saline  soil  reduced  the  salinity  level 
(maximum  15%)  as  compared  with  control.  It  also  decreased  the  pH  value  and  improve  the  N,  P  and  S  status  of  that  soil.

The  highest  dose  of  gypsum  at  300  kg  ha"1  plus  rice-hull  of  8  t  ha"1  was  found  to  be  the  best  among  the  treatments  which 
revealed  that  the  more  higher  doses  of  gypsum  and  rice-hull  may  be  more  effective  in  order  to  improve  the 
physico-chemical  condition  of  the  saline  soil  and  to  boost  up  the  wheat  production  under  saline  environments.  However, 
further  research  is  needed.
