SECRETARY  OF  AGRICULTURE  MIKE  ESPY 
ON  THE  SENATE  COMMITTEE  ON  AGRICULTURE,  NUTRITION 
AND  FORESTRY'S  MARKUP  OF  USDA'S  REORGANIZATION  MEASURE 

March  9,  1994 

"The  Senate's  action  means  that  for  the  first  time  since  its  inception  by  President  Abraham  Lincoln 
over  1 00  years  ago,  we  are  moving  toward  a  significant  reorganization  of  the  Department  of  Agriculture 
that  will  downsize  its  structure,  make  its  mission  more  responsive  to  its  constituencies  and  save  the 
American  taxpayer  real  dollars. 

"On  behalf  of  President  Clinton  and  Vice  President  Gore,  I  applaud  Senators  Leahy  and  Lugar  for 
their  leadership  in  moving  this  measure  forward.  This  markup,  and  the  recent  markup  in  the  House  of 
Representatives  subcommittee,  demonstrates  to  the  American  public  that  reinventing  government  and 
streamlining  are  not  just  slogans  but  a  concrete  effort  to  change  the  way  the  government  does 
business."

USDA'S  MEAT  AND  POULTRY  HOTLINE:  A  LINK  BETWEEN  NUTRITION,  FITNESS  AND  FOOD  SAFETY 

WASHINGTON,  March  7-March  is  National  Nutrition  Month,  and  USDA's  Meat  and  Poultry  Hotline 
is  joining  in  the  observance. 

"This  is  our  third  year  of  responding  to  calls  concerning  nutrition  questions  on  our  nationwide,  toll- 
free  Hotline,"  says  Susan  Conley,  director  of  the  Hotline. 

Launched  in  1985  to  help  consumers  with  food  safety  and  handling  questions  about  meat  and 
poultry  products,  the  Hotline  began  answering  nutrition  questions  as  well  in  October  1991.  The 
Hotline,  in  cooperation  with  other  government  agencies,  serves  as  an  important  link  between  the  areas 
of  nutrition,  fitness  and  food  safety. 

Many  people  calling  the  Hotline  with  nutrition  questions  also  reveal  potentially  unsafe  food 
practices.  "For  example,  raw  eggs  added  to  shakes  or  blended  juices  do  provide  extra  protein  to  the 
diet,"  Conley  explained,  "but  it  is  also  possible  to  introduce  Salmonella  enteritidis,  a  foodborne  pathogen 
that  could  make  people  sick.  Eating  undercooked  or  raw  eggs,  meat  and  poultry  can  cause  illness." 

About  four  percent  of  the  some  131,000  calls  to  the  Hotline  each  year  relate  to  nutrition  issues. 
Common  concerns  include  the  fat  and  cholesterol  content  of  meat  and  poultry  products;  the  nutritional 
differences  between  cooking  chicken  with  or  without  the  skin,  and  the  nutritional  benefits,  if  any,  of 
eating  raw  rather  than  cooked  meat.  "This  is  clearly  a  food  safety  issue,"  said  Conley. 

With  more  food  packages  now  carrying  the  new  nutrition  label,  the  Hotline  staff  also  helps 
consumers  better  understand  the  new  labels. 

"The  Hotline  fully  supports  the  American  Dietetic  Association's  'Eat  Right  America'  campaign,"  says 
Conley.  "Registered  dietitians  and  home  economists  will  continue  to  respond  to  consumers'  food  safety 
and  nutrition  questions,  not  only  during  National  Nutrition  Month,  but  year-round  as  well." 

The  Meat  and  Poultry  Hotline  can  be  reached  at  1-800-535-4555.  In  the  metropolitan  Washington, 
D.C.  area,  the  number  is  (202)  720-3333.

USDA  ENDING  QUARANTINE  ON  CANADIAN  SEED  POTATOES 

WASHINGTON,  March  7-The  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  is  removing  a  federal  quarantine  on 
Canadian  seed  potatoes  that  was  imposed  to  stop  the  spread  of  the  necrotic  strain  of  potato  virus  Y 
(PVYn)  based  on  the  impostion  of  a  certification  program. 

USDA's  Animal  and  Plant  Health  Inspection  Service  is  ending  the  quarantine  because  of  an 
agrement  with  Canada  to  prevent  the  spread  of  PVYn  by  means  of  a  seed  potato  certification  program. 
The  program  is  called  the  Canada/United  States  PVYn  Management  Plan. 

"The  implementation  of  this  plan  will  protect  U.S.  agriculture  from  potential  risks  imposed  by 
PVYn,  making  federal  regulations  that  apply  to  Canada  with  respect  to  PVYn  unnecessary,"  said  B.  Glen 
Lee,  deputy  administrator  of  APHIS's  plant  protection  and  quarantine. 

The  management  plan  calls  for  testing  Canadian  seed  potatoes  for  PVYn  in  early  generations  and 
mandates  the  removal  of  infected  seedlots  from  seed  potato  production. 

Copies  of  the  plan  may  be  obtained  by  writing  James  Petit  de  Mange,  operations  officer,  Port 
Operations  Staff,  PPQ,  APHIS,  USDA,  Room  632  Federal  Building,  6505  Belcrest  Road,  Hyattsville,  Md. 
20782. 

The  new  regulation  was  announced  as  a  final  rule  in  the  March  2  Federal  Register.

USDA  SEEKS  COMMENT  ON  PROPOSED  AMENDMENTS  TO  MIDDLE  ATLANTIC  FEDERAL  MILK 
MARKETING  ORDER 

WASHINGTON,  March  7-The  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  is  inviting  dairy  farmers,  milk 
cooperative  associations,  milk  handlers  (shippers)  and  consumers  to  testify  at  a  hearing  on  proposals 
to  amend  the  Middle  Atlantic  federal  milk  marketing  order. 

The  hearing  will  begin  on  May  2  at  9  a.m.,  at  the  Holiday  Inn-Independence  Mall,  400  Arch  Street, 
Philadelphia,  Pa. 

Lon  Hatamiya,  administrator  of  USDA's  Agricultural  Marketing  Service,  said  a  federation  of  dairy 
producer  cooperatives,  which  requested  the  hearing,  proposes  to  amend  the  order's  "pooling" 
provisions.  At  issue  are  the  rules  for  amounts  of  milk  its  members  must  deliver  or  distribute  under  the 
order  to  be  eligible  to  receive  the  order's  benefits,  he  said. 

The  Middle  Atlantic  milk  marketing  order  affects  northern  Virginia,  eastern  Maryland,  southeastern 
Pennsylvania,  Delaware,  southern  New  Jersey,  and  the  District  of  Columbia. 

Details  of  the  hearing  were  published  as  a  notice  in  the  March  4  Federal  Register.  Copies  of  the 
notice  are  available  from  Rex  F.  Lothrop,  Market  Administrator,  Suite  200  Essex  Building,  333  N. 
Fairfax  Street,  Alexandria,  Va.  22314,  or  USDA,  AMS,  Dairy  Division,  Order  Formulation  Branch,  Rm.

CONCERN  ABOUT  HUNGER  IN  AMERICA  BRINGS  OVER  300  PEOPLE  TO  USDA  FORUM 

WASHINGTON,  March  8-More  than  300  people  from  seven  states  came  to  a  USDA  regional  hunger 
forum  yesterday  in  Kansas  City,  Mo.  to  talk  about  hunger  in  their  communities. 

"Hunger  is  one  of  the  most  haunting  problems  facing  our  country  today,"  said  Shirley  Watkins, 
Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  for  Food  and  Consumer  Services  at  the  Department  of  Agriculture.  "We 
are  here  to  listen  to  your  problems  and  find  solutions." 

Panelists  and  audience  members  at  the  forum  included  advocates,  health  officials,  nutritionists, 
students,  and  people  who  experience  hunger  in  their  daily  lives. 

Forum  co-chair,  U.S.  Rep.  Alan  Wheat  (D-Mo.),  whose  district  includes  Kansas  City,  told  the 
audience,  "Now  is  the  time  to  act  to  solve  the  lingering  problems  of  hunger  in  this  country.  Today  we 
can  send  a  strong  message:  It's  not  enough  to  care.  We  also  have  to  act." 

Aquanette  Babalola  participates  in  the  University  of  Missouri's  Expanded  Food  and  Nutrition 
Education  Program  (EFNEP),  which  she  called  "a  blessing  in  disguise."  As  a  child  living  with  her 
disabled  grandmother,  Aquanette  learned  to  "prepare  nutritious  meals,  to  shop  on  a  fixed  budget,  to 
use  a  recipe,  and  to  prepare  a  grocery  list"  through  EFNEP  instruction. 

The  forum  was  held  at  Harvesters:  The  Community  Food  Network  in  Kansas  City.  Harvesters 
provides  food  to  41  7  not-for-profit  agencies  in  the  Kansas  City  area.  Executive  Director  Judy  Perry 
urged  USDA  to  consolidate  food  assistance  programs  to  maximize  food  resources  and  reduce 
duplication  of  efforts.  In  1 993,  Harvesters  distributed  1 3.6  million  pounds  of  food  and  related  products 
in  the  Kansas  City  area. 

The  forum  in  Kansas  City  is  the  third  in  a  series  of  regional  forums  to  focus  on  regional  obstacles 
and  solutions  in  the  fight  against  hunger  in  America's  communities.  In  June,  Secretary  of  Agriculture 
Mike  Espy  convened  the  National  Hunger  Forum  in  Washington,  D.C.  That  conference  brought  together 
the  largest  and  most  distinguished  group  since  the  White  House  Conference  nearly  25  years  ago. 
Previous  regional  forums  were  held  in  Burlington,  Vt.,  and  McAllen,  Texas.  The  final  forum  will  be  held 
April  22  in  Dayton,  Ohio.

USDA  E.  COLI  DAIRY  CALF  STUDY  POINTS  TO  NEED  FOR  CHANGES  IN  HERD  MANAGEMENT 

WASHINGTON,  March  8--The  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  announced  today  that  a  recently 
completed  one-year  study  indicates  that  herd  management  practices  may  have  an  impact  on  the 
prevalence  of  the  pathogen  E.  coli  0157:H7  in  dairy  herds. 

"This  finding  is  valuable  and  could  point  to  ways  to  lower  the  levels  of  E.  coli  01 57:H7  in  cattle  and 
thus  reduce  the  incidence  of  food  poisoning  and  related  diseases  in  humans,"  said  Patricia  Jensen, 
acting  assistant  secretary  for  marketing  and  inspection  services. 

Cattle  shed  the  E.  coli  0157:H7  organism  in  their  feces,  which  can  contaminate  the  environment 
and  expose  other  animals.  Although  cattle  carry  and  shed  the  bacteria  without  becoming  ill,  human 
illnesses  associated  with  E.  coli  0157:H7  can  include  bloody  diarrhea  and  hemorrhagic  uremic 
syndrome,  a  serious  kidney  disease  and  the  leading  cause  of  acute  kidney  failure  in  children.  Sources 
of  human  infection  vary,  but  many  documented  outbreaks  of  disease  have  been  traced  to  undercooked 
beef.  Humans  can  become  exposed  through  consuming  contaminated  undercooked  meat,  untreated 
water  or  unpasteurized  milk  or  materials  cross  contaminated  with  these  products.  Person-to-person 
transmission  is  also  an  important  source  of  secondary  infections  in  humans. 

Jensen  said  the  dairy  heifer  study,  conducted  by  USDA's  Animal  and  Plant  Health  Inspection 
Service,  is  only  one  of  a  number  of  efforts  by  the  department  to  improve  the  safety  of  meat  and  poultry

products.  "Over  the  past  year,"  she  said,  "we  have  initiated  a  strategic  pathogen  reduction  program 
that  aims  to  reduce  microbial  contamination  from  the  farm  to  the  table." 

The  study  that  APHIS  conducted  through  its  National  Animal  Health  Monitoring  System  followed 
newborn  calves  to  the  weaning  stage.  The  study  included  1 ,81 1  dairy  operations  in  28  states.  Fecal 
samples  collected  from  about  7,000  preweaned  calves  from  over  1 ,000  dairy  operations  were  tested 
for  presence  of  the  pathogen. 

Samples  from  25  of  these  calves  from  1 9  farms  in  1 6  states  tested  positive  for  the  organism,  for 
a  prevalence  of  3.6  per  1 ,000  calves.  Farms  with  positive  test  results  were  spread  across  the  country, 
and  no  regional  or  seasonal  clustering  was  found. 

The  project  next  conducted  a  follow-up  study  on  64  of  the  study  herds  to  look  at  shedding  patterns 
(expelling  the  organism  in  feces)  in  infected  herds  and  to  determine  management  factors  that  might  be 
associated  with  infection.  An  increase  in  prevalence  was  identified  at  8  weeks  of  age,  the  average  age 
at  which  calves  were  weaned.  Weaned  calves  were  three  times  more  likely  to  test  positive  than  calves 
still  nursing  their  mothers. 

The  study  found  that  if  calves  were  grouped  before  weaning,  the  herd  was  nine  times  more  likely 
to  test  positive  than  if  they  were  grouped  after  weaning.  This  indicates  that  grouping  calves  before 
weaning  may  increase  transmission  of  E.  coli  to  other  calves  or  precipitate  shedding  of  the  pathogen 
in  calves  already  carrying  it  in  their  systems. 

Jensen  said  USDA's  food  safety  emphasis  last  year  was  on  enforcement  and  on  developing  a 
science-based  inspection  system.  She  said  food  safety  improvements  have  included  special 
unannounced  reviews  of  meat  and  poultry  plants,  which  resulted  in  temporarily  stopping  activities  at 
several  plants;  mandating  and  improving  training  on  zero  tolerance  for  fecal  matter  on  beef  carcasses; 
increased  research  from  the  farm  to  the  table  to  develop  methods^to  detect  and  destroy  pathogens,  as 
well  as  new  inspection  methods  based  on  sound  science;  rapid  bacteria  test  research;  and  the  hiring 
of  200  additional  inspectors  in  the  Food  Safety  and  Inspection  Service  and  an  additional  200  in  the 
fiscal  1995  budget. 

"We  are  in  the  process  of  issuing  a  final  rule  mandating  safe  cooking  and  handling  labels  for  raw 
and  partially  cooked  meat  and  poultry  products,"  Jensen  noted.  "USDA  also  is  engaged  in  a  broad 
range  of  cooperative  efforts  with  the  states  and  with  other  federal  agencies  to  enhance  food  safety. 
Currently,  more  than  70  pathogen  reduction  activities  are  underway."

ESPY  ANNOUNCES  PROPOSAL  TO  IMPROVE  POULTRY  INSPECTION  SYSTEM 

WASHINGTON,  March  9  --  Agriculture  Secretary  Mike  Espy  today  announced  the  U.S.  Department 
of  Agriculture  will  further  enhance  and  strengthen  the  poultry  inspection  system  to  include  microbial 
testing  and  the  prohibition  of  all  fecal  matter  on  raw  product. 

"We  have  made  improving  the  meat  and  poultry  inspection  system  at  USDA  a  top  priority  and 
today's  announcement  is  another  move  in  that  direction,"  said  Espy.  "We  are  taking  steps  to  further 
incorporate  science  and  modernize  the  nation's  meat  and  poultry  system." 

The  secretary's  poultry  initiative  includes  several  major  changes  that  will  be  proposed  in  the  Federal 
Register. 

Today's  proposal  includes: 

♦  No  amount  of  fecal  matter  will  be  allowed  on  raw  product.  This  will  formalize  the  policy  in 
regulation.  When  Espy  came  to  office  he  reinforced  this  policy  for  red  meat  and  directed  the  Food 
Safety  and  Inspection  Service  to  draft  a  similar  proposal  for  poultry.  Fecal  matter  will  no  longer  be 
acceptable  as  part  of  a  finished  product  standard. 

♦  Regular  microbial  testing  will  be  mandated  on  a  statistical  sampling  of  product.  This  will  further 
incorporate  science  into  the  system. 

♦  Industry  will  be  required  to  use  FDA-approved  rinses  that  reduce  overall  bacterial  levels  on  raw 
product.  As  more  compounds  are  developed  and  given  FDA  approval,  immediate  use  will  be  allowed. 


Page  5 


♦  A  part  of  the  inspection  sequence  will  be  changed.  Currently,  the  initial  inspection  of  the  poultry 
carcasses  is  before  the  internal  organs  are  removed.  Today's  proposal  calls  for  the  inspection  to  take 
place  before  and  after  the  internal  organs  are  removed.  This  will  ensure  that  the  carcasses  are 
examined  after  a  key  point  of  potential  contamination  (organ  removal)  and  before  the  chiller. 

♦  Fecal-contaminated  poultry  carcasses  will  be  allowed  to  be  washed  inside  and  outside,  rather  than 
trimmed,  if  removal  is  effective;  however,  all  birds  will  be  re-inspected  after  reprocessing  rather  than 
a  sampling.  This  move  is  based  on  a  1993  study  which  reconfirms  the  efficacy  of  washing. 

♦  Steps  will  be  taken  to  reduce  stress  on  inspectors  and  the  risk  of  repetitive  motion  trauma. 

Since  coming  to  office  in  January  1993,  Espy  has  made  several  major  improvements  to  the  meat 

and  poultry  inspection  system,  including  launching  unannounced  reviews  of  plants,  hiring  additional 
inspectors,  accelerating  research  on  microbial  testing  and  moving  toward  mandating  safe  cooking  and 
handling  labels  for  raw  meat  and  poultry.

USDA  CONTINUES  SPECIAL  REVIEWS  OF  MEAT  AND  POULTRY  PLANTS 

WASHINGTON,  March  11  -  As  part  of  the  continuing  review  on  meat  and  poultry  plants  around 
the  nation,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture's  Food  Safety  and  Inspection  Service  has  released  a 
follow-up  report  on  79  plants  previously  identified  as  having  serious  deficiencies.  The  report  notes  that 
FSIS  enhanced  enforcement  is  helping  to  improve  plants.  In  September,  58  plants  had  improved  and 
21  plants  received  accelerated  deficiency  notices.  Further,  reviews  were  conducted  in  the  21  plants 
with  only  seven  repeat  accelerated  deficiency  notices  being  issued. 

"The  report  issued  is  part  of  the  unannounced  reviews  of  1,000  plants  and  USDA's  continuing 
effort  to  strengthen  enforcement  of  its  regulations  in  the  nation's  meat  and  poultry  plants,"  said 
Agriculture  Secretary  Mike  Espy,  who  has  made  improving  the  meat  and  poultry  inspection  system  a 
primary  objective  of  USDA.  "Our  special  review  team  is  working  throughout  the  nation,  and  we  feel 
strongly  that  we  are  making  a  difference.  We  are  sending  a  clear  message  that  our  inspectors  will 
continue  to  aggressively  work  to  hold  plants  to  the  highest  standards." 

The  reviews  in  the  report  took  place  in  September  and  follow-up  visits  took  place  from  November 
through  January.  Observations  observed  by  the  review  team  ranged  from  poor  lighting,  to  rodent  and 
pest  infestation  to  contaminated  product.  A  plant  receives  an  accelerated  deficiency  notice  when  the 
review  team  observes  a  serious  loss  of  process  control  and  product  adulteration. 

Two  of  the  21  plants  reviewed  and  which  received  accelerated  deficiency  notices,  Ben  Kezar 
Wholesale  Meats  of  Grantham,  N.H.,  and  Brown's  Meat  Plant  of  Troy,  Tenn.,  have  withdrawn  from  the 
federal  inspection  system. 

Of  the  21  plants  given  a  second  review  between  December  and  January,  the  seven  plants

The  release  of  today's  report  follows  earlier  reports  issued  by  Espy  which  outlined  observations 
found  at  plants  by  the  special  review  team.  The  last  report  was  issued  Feb.  4  and  cited  the  findings 
in  26  turkey  plants.  In  1993,  Espy  released  a  report  on  90  beef  plants. 

Since  coming  to  office  in  January,  1993,  Espy  has  made  improvements  to  the  meat  and  poultry 
inspection  system,  including  launching  unannounced  reviews  of  plants,  hiring  additional  inspectors, 
accelerating  research  on  microbial  testing  and  moving  toward  mandating  safe  cooking  anc^handling 
labels  for  raw  meat  and  poultry.

1993-CROP  FEED  GRAINS  NOT  ELIGIBLE  TO  ENTER  FARMER-OWNED  RESERVE 

WASHINGTON,  March  1 1 -Grant  Buntrock,  executive  vice  president  of  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture's  Commodity  Credit  Corporation,  today  announced  that  1993-crop  feed  grains  will  not  be 
allowed  to  enter  the  farmer-owned  reserve  (FOR).  "The  statute  prohibits  entry  when  both  market 
prices  exceed  the  entry  level  and  the  stocks-to-use  ratio  is  below  the  trigger  requirement,"  Buntrock 
said.  "Both  conditions  now  exist,  so  the  CCC  does  not  have  the  authority  to  allow  1993-crop  feed 
grains  into  the  reserve." 

As  of  Feb.  25,  the  90-day  average  of  corn  prices  was  $2.71  per  bushel-well  above  the  $2./06 
trigger  level.  Also,  the  estimated  1 993/94  corn  ending  S/U  is  0. 1 01  -well  below  the  0.225  S/U  trigger 
level.

SOYBEAN  PRODUCERS  TO  CONTINUE  PROMOTION  AND  RESEARCH  PROGRAM 

WASHINGTON,  March  1 1 -Secretary  of  Agriculture  Mike  Espy  has  determined  that  the  majority 
of  soybean  producers  voting  in  a  Feb.  9  national  referendum  voted  to  continue  the  National  Soybean 
Promotion  and  Research  Program. 

Secretary  Espy  said  program  changes  that  the  referendum  puts  into  motion  become  effective  April 

1. 

Lon  Hatamiya,  administrator  of  USDA's  Agricultural  Marketing  Service,  the  agency  with  oversight 
responsibility  for  USDA  research  and  promotion  programs,  said,  "Of  the  85,606  valid  ballots  cast, 
46,060,  or  53.8  percent  favored  the  program  and  39,546,  or  46.2  percent,  opposed  continuing  it." 

AMS  conducted  the  referendum  with  the  assistance  of  the  Cooperative  Extension  Service  and  the 
Agricultural  Stabilization  and  Conservation  Service. 

"The  law  authorizing  the  program  requires  the  majority  of  voting  producers  to  support  continuation 
of  the  program.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  referendum,  assessments  of  one  half  of  one  percent  of  the 
net  market  price  of  soybeans  sold  by  producers  will  continue  to  be  collected  and  used  by  the  United 
Soybean  Board  and  Qualified  State  Soybean  Boards,"  Hatamiya  said. 

As  a  result  of  the  continuation  of  the  National  Soybean  Promotion  and  Research  Program,  the  law 
which  authorizes  the  program  mandates  changes  in  the  way  assessments  are  refunded: 

-Refunds  will  be  limited  to  10  percent  of  total  collections,  on  a  state-by-state  basis.  Producers 
requesting  refunds  will  receive  a  pro-rata  share  of  their  state's  available  funds  up  to  the  amount  they 
paid  into  the  fund. 

-Refunds  will  no  longer  be  paid  on  a  monthly  basis.  Instead,  they  will  be  paid  after  the  end  of  the 
respective  qualified  state  soybean  board's  fiscal  year. 

Full  refunds  on  assessments  paid  prior  to  April  1  will  continue  to  be  available,  Hatamiya  said.

Assessments  generated  under  the  program  finance  promotion,  research  and  consumer  information 
activities  to  strengthen  the  soybean  industry's  position  in  the  marketplace.  AMS  monitors  activities 
carried  out  under  the  act. 

Notice  of  the  determination  of  the  national  soybean  referendum  is  scheduled  to  be  published  in  the 
Federal  Register  in  late  March.  For  copies,  contact  Ralph  Tapp,  Chief,  Research  and  Promotion  Branch,

STORAGE  PAYMENTS  RESUME  FOR  FARMER-OWNED-RESERVE  WHEAT 

WASHINGTON,  March  7-Grant  Buntrock,  executive  vice  president  of  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture's  Commodity  Credit  Corporation,  today  announced  that  storage  payments  on  wheat  in  the 
farmer-owned-reserve  (FOR)  resumed  March  2. 

Buntrock  said  that  "Despite  the  resumption  in  storage  payments,  producers  may  continue  to  market 
their  FOR  wheat." 

Storage  payments  stopped  Nov.  30,  1993  when  the  5-day  moving  average  price  of  the  classes  of 
wheat  in  the  FOR  reached  95  percent  ($3.80  per  bushel)  of  the  $4.00  per  bushel  wheat  target  price. 
The  nonstorage  earning  period  continues  until  prices  have  been  below  the  storage-stop  trigger  level  for 
more  than  90  consecutive  days. 

The  last  day  on  which  the  wheat  market  price  equalled  or  exceeded  95  percent  of  the  wheat  target 
price  was  Dec.  1,  1993.  Therefore,  March  1  is  the  end  of  the  nonstorage  earning  period  and  storage 
payments  resume  on  March  2. 

Storage  payments  are  26.5  cents  per  bushel,  per  year,  paid  at  the  end  of  each  quarter.  As  of  Feb. 
15,  1994,  12.6  million  bushels  of  1990-crop  wheat  remained  in  the  FOR.

USDA  EXTENDS  ASSESSMENT  DUE  DATE  ON  IMPORTED  TOBACCO 

WASHINGTON,  March  7  -  Grant  Buntrock,  executive  vice  president  of  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture's  Commodity  Credit  Corporation,  today  announced  that  the  original  due  date  of  March  10 
for  remittance  of  budget  deficit  marketing  assessments  and  importer  no-net-cost  assessments  on 
tobacco  imported  on  or  after  January  1,  1994,  will  be  extended  until  April  10,  1994. 

These  assessments,  as  applicable,  are  due  on  each  pound  of  unmanufac-tured  tobacco  entered  into 
the  United  States,  Buntrock  said. 

USDA  plans  to  publish  shortly  a  rule  finalizing  a  previously  published  interim  rule  which  implements 
the  provisions  of  the  Omnibus  Budget  Reconcilia-tion  Act  of  1993  relating  to  the  budget  deficit 
marketing  assessment  and  the  importer  no-net-cost  assessment  prior  to  March  10,  1994.

USDA  SEEKS  COMMENTS  ON  MALTING  BARLEY  ASSESSMENT  RATE 

WASHINGTON,  March  1 1—The  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture's  Commodity  Credit  Corporation  is 
seeking  comments  on  an  amendment  to  regulations  that  change  the  malting  barley  assessment  from 
5  percent  to  2.5  percent  for  the  1993  through  1995  crops  of  barley. 

Grant  Buntrock,  CCC  executive  vice  president,  said  the  2.5  percent  assessment  is  based  on  the 
individual  state's  average  malting  barley  price  received  by  producers  during  the  first  five  months  of  the 
barley  marketing  year,  June  1 -October  31 .  For  those  states  for  which  an  average  malting  barley  price 
is  not  established,  the  2.5  percent  assessment  is  based  on  the  national  average  malting  barley  price 
received  by  growers,  Buntrock  said. 

The  Agricultural  Act  of  1 949,  as  amended,  provides  that  the  Secretary  of  Agriculture  shall  levy  an 
assessment,  up  to  5  percent,  on  malting  barley  producers  participating  in  the  barley  production 
adjustment  program  for  each  of  the  1991-1995  crop  years.  The  assessment  was  5  percent  for  each 
of  the  1991  and  1992  crops  of  barley. 

The  adjusted  assessment  will  improve  the  competitive  position  of  U.S.  barley  producers  and  reduce 
the  distortions  on  barley  marketings  and  production  caused  by  the  previous  higher  assessment, 
Buntrock  said. 

The  2.5  percent  assessment  became  effective  when  published  in  the  Federal  Register  March  7. 

Comments  must  be  received  by  April  6  to  be  considered  and  may  either  be  FAXed  to  (202) 
690-1346  or  mailed  to:  Phil  Sronce,  Director,  Grains  Analysis  Division,  USDA/ASCS,  Room  3742-S, 
P.O.  Box  2415.  All  comments  will  be  available  for  public  inspection  in  Room  3740  in  USDA's  South 
Building,  14th  Street  and  Independence  Avenue,  S.W.,  Washington,  D.C.  during  regular  business  hours.

A  New  Agricultural  Product 

LESQUERELLA:  GLOBAL  RETHINKING  OF  RENEWABLE  RESOURCES 

WASHINGTON,  March  7  --  If  all  goes  according  to  plan,  expect  to  see  lesquerella  --  a  desert  shrub 
native  to  the  American  Southwest  --  transformed  into  an  important  ingredient  in  everything  from  high- 
performance  specialty  plastics,  industrial  nylons,  and  lubricants  to  high-priced  cosmetics. 

The  lesquerella  seed  produces  a  vegetable  oil.  Dr.  Keith  Walker,  director  of  development  for  the 
Agrigenetics  Company  of  San  Diego,  Calif.,  says  lesquerella's  commercial  prospects  are  promising. 
"The  things  that  bode  well  for  vegetable  oils  as  industrial  products  are  the  global  rethinking  of  the  role 
of  renewable  resources  and  the  interest  in  so-called  'environmentally  friendly  products.'  These  trends 
mean  that  a  new  product  may  not  be  economically  viable  now,  but  very  soon  it  could  become  viable 
due  to  environmental  and  political  changes." 


Page  1 1 


Agrigenetics  is  so  upbeat  about  lesquerella's  future  that  it  is  spearheading  a  consortium  designed 
to  replace  the  $30  million  worth  of  imported  castor  oil  with  domestically  produced  lesquerella  oil  as 
quickly  as  possible. 

To  support  this  effort,  the  Alternative  Agriculture  Research  and  Commercialization  (AARC)  Center, 
a  branch  of  the  U.S.  Department  of 

Agriculture,  is  investing  $500,000  to  speed  development  of  lesquerella.  The  Center  funds  projects  that 
will  expand  industrial  and  commercial  uses  of  agricultural  and  forest  products.  This  investment  will  be 
repaid  with  interest  once  lesquerella  oil  production  is  commercialized. 

Agrigenetics  plans  to  invest  an  additional  $267,00  and  other  partners  have  pledged  over  $1 
million.  Previous  Agrigenetics  research  established  that  lesquerella  seed,  grown  and  processed  with 
standard  equipment,  produces  specialty  oils  containing  commercially  valuable  hydroxy  fatty  acids.  The 
current  project  focuses  on  domesticating  wild  lesquerella  to  raise  its  yield  of  both  seed  and  high-quality 
oil. 

Lesquerella  offers  environmental  and  economic  benefits  including  new  products  made  from  a 
domestic  renewable  resource  and  an  alternative  crop  for  farmers  that  requires  less  water  than  traditional 
crops  such  as  cotton.

A  New  Agricultural  Product 

GRASS  MATS  GROW  NEW  JOBS  FOR  RURAL  AMERICA 

WASHINGTON,  March  8  --  What  happens  when  you  take  50,000  acres  of  kenaf  and  add  grass 
seed  and  ingenuity? 

The  expected  result  is  the  creation  of  46  new  jobs  in  a  rural  community  and  the  environmental 
benefits  associated  with  finding  new  uses  for  soil-protecting,  renewable  agricultural  products.  Kenaf 
is  an  ancient  fiber  crop  now  grown  in  the  southern  and  western  states. 

The  new  McCarthy  Farms  roll  and  grow  kenaf  grass  mat  developed  by  Agro-Fibers,  Inc.  of 
Corcoran,  Calif.,  offers  an  economical  way  to  create  a  new  lawn  -  in  some  cases  saving  the  consumer 
40  percent  or  more  over  traditional  seeding  methods.  The  mat  is  entirely  biodegradable  and  helps 
fertilize  the  grass  seed  as  it  grows.  It  also  reduces  the  amount  of  water  required  to  start  a  lawn. 

The  combination  of  job  creation  and  environmental  benefits  naturally  attracted  the  interest  of  the 
new  Alternative  Agriculture  Research  and  Commer-cialization  (AARC)  Center,  a  branch  of  the  U.S. 
Department  of  Agriculture.  The  Center  funds  projects  that  will  expand  industrial  and  commericial  uses 
of  agricultural  and  forest  products. 

Typical  of  the  generally  small  entrepreneurial  firms  picked  by  the  Center  for  the  initial  awards  of 
$10  million,  Agro-Fibers  is  in  line  to  receive  an  $800,000  investment  of  AARC  Center  money.  In 
return,  the  company  will  be  combining  new  ideas,  new  technology,  and  a  new  commercial  crop  in  ways 
designed  both  to  generate  rural  jobs  and  to  improve  the  environment.  If  sales  of  the  new  kenaf  grass 
mats  develop  as  rapidly  as  planned,  the  investment  should  be  fully  repaid  with  interest  within  two  to 
three  years.

The  number  of  new  production  plants  --  and  the  number  of  new  jobs  --will  depend  on  consumer 
demand.  Early  interest  in  the  product  suggests  that  the  initial  plant  employing  46  people  will  be  the 
first  of  many.  The  company  expects  to  carve  out  an  estimated  $50-million  niche  in  the  multi-billion 
dollar  home  gardening  industry.  The  greater  this  niche  turns  out  to  be,  the  greater  will  be  the 
environmental  benefits  from  turning  waste  forest  fibers  and  soil-saving  kenaf ,  grown  without  chemicals, 
into  a  high-value  commercial  product.

USDA'S  MEAT  AND  POULTRY  HOTLINE  OFFERS  ADVICE  FOR  ST.  PATRICK'S  CORNED  BEEF  DINNERS 

WASHINGTON,  March  8-Finally,  March  has  arrived  with  hopes  of  spring  soon  behind.  March  for 
USDA's  Meat  and  Poultry  Hotline  means  St.  Patrick's  Day  celebrations  across  the  country  will  spark 
many  questions  about  safe  handling  and  preparation  of  corned  beef  and  cabbage. 

Why  corned  beef  on  St.  Patrick's  Day?  That's  a  story  in  itself.  When  most  people  are  asked  why 
they  prepare  corned  beef  and  cabbage  on  March  17,  the  answer  usually  is,  "because  that's  what  you 
always  serve  on  St.  Patrick's  Day.  It's  tradition." 

Just  as  Thanksgiving  is  associated  with  turkey,  so  is  corned  beef  and  cabbage  with  St.  Patrick's 
Day. 

But  how  this  "tradition"  started  is  unclear. 

"What  is  clear  is  that  corned  beef  has  nothing  to  do  with  corn,"  says  Susan  Conley,  Director  of  the 
U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture's  toll-free  Meat  and  Poultry  Hotline.  "Corned  beef  got  its  name  in 
Anglo-Saxon  times  when  coarse  'corns  of  salt'  were  used  to  process  the  meat. 

"Originally  meat  was  preserved  by  dry  salting,"  explained  Conley,  "but  as  brining  took  the  place  of 
salting,  the  term  'corned  beef'  still  held.  We  usually  say  'corned  beef'  instead  of  brined  or  pickled 
beef." 

Whatever  its  origins,  corned  beef  has  generated  a  number  of  calls  on  the  Hotline.  One  of  the  most 
often  asked  questions  is  how  long  it  can  be  kept  in  the  refrigerator  or  freezer. 

Some  packages  may  display  a  "sell-by"  or  "use-by"  date,  Conley  said.  Products  with  a  "use-by" 
date  can  be  stored  unopened  in  the  refrigerator  until  that  time.  "We  advise  callers  that  corned  beef 
products  without  a  date  or  with  a  'sell-by'  date  can  be  kept  in  the  refrigerator  for  up  to  a  week  after 
purchase,  or  up  to  a  month  in  the  freezer,"  says  Conley.  "For  best  results,  buy  your  corned  beef  as 
close  to  St.  Patrick's  Day  as  possible." 

What  happens  if  the  corned  beef  is  kept  in  the  freezer  for  more  than  a  month.  Is  it  still  safe? 
Conley  says  the  answer  is  "yes,"  but  that  longer  freezing  could  lead  to  quality  loss. 

As  for  the  spices  used  to  flavor  the  beef  these  days,  Conley  says  that  will  depend  on  the  processor 
and  the  section  of  the  country  someone  lives  in.  The  most  commonly  used  spices,  however,  are 
peppercorn  and  bay  leaf. 

Another  often-asked  question:  What  cuts  of  meat  are  used  for  corned  beef?  Corned  beef  is  made 
from  one  of  several  less-tender  beef  cuts  like  the  brisket,  rump  and  round.  Therefore,  it  requires  long, 
moist  cooking. 

Keep  food  safety  in  mind  when  preparing  the  corned  beef.  Corned  beef  can  be  cooked  on  top  of 
the  range  along  with  the  favored  cabbage  and  potatoes;  in  a  slow  cooker;  in  the  oven;  or  started  in  the 
microwave  and  finished  up  in  the  oven. 

Remember,  set  the  oven  temperature  no  lower  than  325  F  to  start.  Just  barely  cover  the  meat  with 
water  and  keep  the  dish  or  pot  covered  throughout  cooking.  Juices  should  bubble  slightly,  but  not  boil.

The  meat  should  cook  for  one  hour  per  pound  either  in  the  oven  or  on  the  range;  longer  in  a  slow 
cooker. 

,  A  number  of  callers  are  also  concerned  about  how  to  know  when  cooked  corned  beef  is  ready  to 
eat.  "Fork-tender  is  a  good  indication,  but  to  be  sure,  use  a  meat  thermometer,"  advises  Conley,  "and 
cook  until  the  internal  temperature  has  reached  at  least  1 60  F.  Then  you  will  know  that  you  have 
safely  prepared  the  meat." 

Still  other  callers  to  the  Flotline  ask  why  corned  beef  is  still  pink  in  color  after  cooking.  "That's 
because  the  meat  is  cured  with  nitrite,  which  fixes  the  meat  pigments,  and  sometimes  affects  the  meat 
color,"  says  Conley. 

Consumers  who  would  like  more  information  about  corned  beef  and  other  meat  and  poultry 
products,  should  call  the  toll-free  Meat  and  Poultry  Hotline  at  1-800-535-4555.  In  the  metropolitan 
Washington,  D.C.  area,  the  number  is  (202)  720-3333.

A  New  Agricultural  Product 

KENAF  REVIVAL  COULD  LAUNCH  TEXAS  NEWSPRINT  INDUSTRY 

WASHINGTON,  March  11—  One  of  the  world's  oldest  fiber  crops  —  kenaf  --  could  become  a  major 
source  of  the  "newsprint"  paper  used  for  newspapers.  Since  more  than  half  of  the  nation's  newsprint 
is  currently  imported,  adding  about  $3.8  billion  to  the  U.S.  trade  deficit  each  year,  kenaf  newsprint 
could  save  both  trees  and  money. 

Drawing  on  more  than  20  years  of  active  U.S.  research  into  kenaf  production  methods  and 
potential  markets  for  this  annual,  hot-climate  crop,  Kenaf  International  of  McAllen,  Texas  now  plans 
to  build  a  $50-million  paper  mill  designed  to  produce  30,000  tons  of  newsprint  per  year. 

After  repeated  commercial-scale  tests,  kenaf  is  acknowledged  as  a  cost-competitive  source  of 
newsprint.  Compared  with  wood-pulp  paper,  research  shows  kenaf  paper  as  stronger,  whiter,  less 
yellowing,  capable  of  sharper  photo  reproduction,  and  more  user-friendly  due  to  better  ink  adherence 
(thus  requiring  less  ink  and  resulting  in  less  ink  ruboff  on  readers'  hands). 

The  proposed  plant  is  designed  to  produce  newsprint  from  a  mix  of  kenaf  and  recycled 
newspapers,  with  the  ratio  varied  depending  on  the  availability  of  the  two  components. 

Kenaf  International  General  Manager  Charles  Taylor  says  kenaf  newsprint  pays  dividends  both 
economically  and  environmentally.  A  tree-free  paper  that  requires  relatively  minimal  chemical  inputs 
in  either  field  or  mill  operations  reduces  both  costs  and  environmental  concerns,"  he  said.  "Energy 
consumption  is  15  to  25  percent  lower  for  kenaf  than  that  required  to  pulp  southern  pine  .  .  .  and  the 
treated  waste  water  can  be  used  to  irrigate  nearby  fiber  crops."  Another  plus  is  that  in  field  trials  in  the 
southeast  U.S.,  kenaf  has  yielded  three  to  five  times  more  fiber  per  acre  per  year  than  southern  pine. 

The  Alternative  Agriculture  Research  and  Commercialization  Center,  a  branch  of  the  U.S. 
Department  of  Agriculture,  is  investing  a  repayable  $100,000  to  help  Kenaf  International  prepare 
materials  for  a  project  financing  plan  for  presentation  to  potential  investors  and  lenders.  The  Center 
funds  projects  that  will  expand  industrial  and  commericial  uses  of  agricultural  and  forest  products. 

Supplying  the  proposed  newsprint  plant  would  provide  a  steady  market  to  grow  kenaf  on  far 
greater  acreage  for  the  25  Texas  farmers  who  are  now  growing  it  on  only  3,000  acres  for  research  and 
limited  marketing  purposes.
