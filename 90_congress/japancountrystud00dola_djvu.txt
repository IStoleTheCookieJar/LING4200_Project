Foreword 


This  volume  is  one  in  a  continuing  series  of  books  prepared  by 
the  Federal  Research  Division  of  the  Library  of  Congress  under 
the  Country  Studies — Area  Handbook  Program  sponsored  by  the 
Department  of  the  Army.  The  last  page  of  this  book  lists  the  other 
published  studies. 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  country, 
describing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and  national 
security  systems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the  interrelation- 
ships of  those  systems  and  the  ways  they  are  shaped  by  cultural 
factors.  Each  study  is  written  by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social 
scientists.  The  authors  seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of 
the  observed  society,  striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static 
portrayal.  Particular  attention  is  devoted  to  the  people  who  make 
up  the  society,  their  origins,  dominant  beliefs  and  values,  their  com- 
mon interests  and  the  issues  on  which  they  are  divided,  the  nature 
and  extent  of  their  involvement  with  national  institutions,  and  their 
attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward  their  social  system  and 
political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should  not 
be  construed  as  an  expression  of  an  official  United  States  govern- 
ment position,  policy,  or  decision.  The  authors  have  sought  to 
adhere  to  accepted  standards  of  scholarly  objectivity.  Corrections, 
additions,  and  suggestions  for  changes  from  readers  will  be  wel- 
comed for  use  in  future  editions.

Acknowledgments 


The  authors  wish  to  acknowledge  their  use  and  adaptation  of 
information  from  various  chapters  in  the  1983  edition  of  Japan:  A 
Country  Study,  edited  by  Frederica  M.  Bunge.  The  authors  are  also 
indebted  to  a  number  of  individuals  and  organizations  who  gave 
their  time  and  special  knowledge  of  Japanese  affairs  to  provide 
research  data  and  perspective.  Among  those  who  gave  generous 
and  timely  help  were  Warren  M.  Tsuneishi,  Chief  of  the  Asian 
Division,  Library  of  Congress,  who  commented  on  the  completed 
manuscript.  Also  instrumental  in  providing  timely  and  useful  data 
were  Shojo  Honda  and  other  staff  members  of  the  Japanese  Sec- 
tion of  the  Asian  Division. 

Others  who  provided  insight  and  research  materials  to  the  authors 
were  Haruyuki  Furukawa  of  the  Japanese  National  Diet  staff  and 
Col.  Isao  Mukunoki  of  the  Japanese  Embassy  in  Washington. 
Yoriyoshi  Naito  of  the  Asahi  Shimbun  and  Rikuo  Sato  of  the  Mainichi 
Newspapers,  both  in  Washington,  were  extremely  helpful  in  provid- 
ing photographs  for  use  in  the  book. 

Various  members  of  the  staff  of  the  Federal  Research  Division 
of  the  Library  of  Congress  assisted  in  the  preparation  of  the  book. 
Timothy  Merrill  reviewed  the  maps  and  geographical  references 
in  the  book.  David  P.  Cabitto  prepared  the  artwork  for  the  cover 
illustration  and  coordinated  the  production  of  all  maps  and  figures. 
Alberta  J.  King  provided  research  and  word  processing  assistance 
for  sections  of  the  book  and  contributed  to  the  final  proofreading. 
Janie  L.  Gilchrist  provided  word  processing  assistance  on  parts  of 
the  book,  and  Barbara  Edgerton  and  Izella  Watson  performed  fi- 
nal word  processing  for  the  completed  manuscript.  Sandra  W. 
Meditz  made  helpful  suggestions  during  her  review  of  all  parts  of 
the  book  and  coordinated  work  with  Ralph  K.  Benesch,  who  over- 
sees the  Country  Studies — Area  Handbook  program  for  the  Depart- 
ment of  the  Army.  Marilyn  L.  Majeska  managed  editing  and 
production  of  the  book,  with  assistance  from  Andrea  T.  Merrill 
and  Martha  E.  Hopkins. 

Other  Library  of  Congress  staff  who  assisted  with  the  prepara- 
tion of  the  book  were  Ewen  Allison  and  Carol  Winfree,  both  of 
the  Congressional  Research  Service,  who  provided  research  as- 
sistance and  word  processing  support,  respectively,  for  the  chap- 
ter on  foreign  relations.  Malinda  B.  Neale  of  the  Library  of 
Congress  Composing  Unit  prepared  camera-ready  copy,  under  the 
direction  of  Peggy  F.  Pixley.

The  authors  also  want  to  thank  other  individuals  who  contributed 
to  the  preparation  of  the  manuscript:  Marcie  D.  Rinka  of  John 
Carroll  University  for  word  processing  support  for  the  chapter  on 
society  and  environment;  Greenhorne  and  O'Mara  for  prepara- 
tion of  the  map  drafts;  Reiko  I.  Seekins  and  Marti  Ittner,  who 
designed  the  illustrations  on  the  tide  pages  of  chapters  one  and  chap- 
ters two  through  eight,  respectively;  and  Wayne  Home  for  his 
graphics  support.  Additionally,  special  thanks  go  to  Ann  H.  Covalt, 
who  edited  the  manuscript;  Catherine  Schwartzstein,  who  per- 
formed the  final  prepublication  editorial  review;  and  Joan  C.  Cook, 
who  prepared  the  index. 

Finally,  the  authors  are  especially  grateful  to  those  individuals 
and  organizations  who  donated  photographs  and  artwork  for  the 
illustrations  used  in  the  book,  many  of  which  are  original  work 
not  previously  published.  They  are  acknowledged  in  the  illustra- 
tion captions.

Preface 


This  edition  supersedes  the  fourth  edition  of  Japan:  A  Country 
Study,  published  in  1983.  It  provides  updated  information  on  one 
of  the  most  economically  powerful  nations  in  the  world  in  a  period 
of  significant  economic  change.  Although  much  of  what  was  re- 
ported in  1983  has  remained  the  same  in  regard  to  traditional  be- 
havior and  organizational  dynamics,  world  events  have  continued 
to  shape  Japanese  domestic  and  international  policies.  Improved 
relations  with  virtually  all  countries  of  the  Asia-Pacific  region, 
democracy  movements  in  Eastern  Europe,  the  general  improve- 
ment in  East- West  relations,  volatile  changes  in  the  Middle  East, 
economic  uncertainty  throughout  the  world,  competition  for  in- 
ternational markets,  high-technology  developments,  and  the  whole 
panoply  of  Japanese  relations  with  its  major  business  and  security 
partner,  the  United  States,  have  all  affected  Japan  as  it  moves 
toward  a  new  century. 

The  aim  of  the  authors  of  the  new  edition  of  Japan:  A  Country 
Study  has  been  to  analyze  Japanese  society  with  respect  to  its  an- 
cient traditions  and  postwar  transformation.  Both  its  long  histori- 
cal and  societal  evolution  and  its  emergence  in  the  second  half  of 
the  twentieth  century  as  a  major  actor  on  the  international  politi- 
cal and  economic  scene  are  considered  in  depth. 

The  Hepburn  system  of  romanization  is  used  for  Japanese  per- 
sonal names,  which  generally  appear  in  standard  order,  with  the 
family  name  first.  In  cases  of  certain  well-known  historical  figures, 
such  as  Tokugawa  Ieyasu  (Ieyasu),  or  members  of  famous  fami- 
lies, such  as  the  Fujiwara,  the  individual  is  referred  to  by  given 
name.  The  spelling  of  place  names  follows  usage  of  the  United  States 
Board  on  Geographic  Names.  The  pinyin  system  of  romanization 
is  used  for  most  Chinese  names  and  terms.  Measurements  are  given 
in  the  metric  system;  a  conversion  table  is  provided  to  assist  read- 
ers unfamiliar  with  metric  measurements  (see  table  1 ,  Appendix). 

Users  of  this  book  are  encouraged  to  consult  the  chapter  bib- 
liographies at  the  end  of  the  book.  Selected  specialized  bibliographies 
have  been  listed  in  the  Bibliography  for  those  wishing  to  do  fur- 
ther reading  and  research.  Additionally,  users  may  wish  to  use  other 
bibliographies,  such  as  the  Japan  Foundation's  Catalogue  of  Books

liography for  Japanese  Studies  (4  vols. ,  Tokyo,  1975-82),  which  covers

Introduction 


JAPAN  IN  1990  WAS  a  modern,  thriving  democracy,  yet  it  re- 
tained a  long  and  esteemed  imperial  tradition.  The  Japanese  took 
great  pride  in  being  "unique,"  yet  much  of  Japanese  civilization 
was  composed  of  selective  borrowings,  from  the  Chinese  written 
language  in  the  sixth  century  to  United  States  semiconductors  in 
the  latter  half  of  the  twentieth  century.  Although  Japan  lacked 
almost  all  raw  materials,  it  was  a  highly  urbanized  and  industrial- 
ized economic  power  supplying  vast  export  markets.  Yet  farming 
interests  still  exerted  a  strong  influence  on  the  ruling  Liberal 
Democratic  Party  (LDP)  and  its  trade  policies.  Japan  was  a  rich 
country,  ranking  first  among  major  industrial  nations  in  per  cap- 
ita gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary),  but  many  of  its 
people  were  crowded  into  inadequate  housing  lacking  such  basic 
amenities  as  indoor  plumbing.  Although  the  bushido  (way  of  the 
warrior)  legacy  of  the  feudal  era  still  exerted  a  definite  influence 
on  modern  society,  the  ultranationalism  that  it  had  spawned  was 
repudiated  and  the  military  machine  that  earlier  in  the  twentieth 
century  had  conquered  much  of  the  Asia-Pacific  region  had  been 
replaced  by  streamlined  Self-Defense  Forces,  well  trained  but  under- 
equipped  and  barely  able  to  defend  the  home  islands. 

Japan  consists  of  the  four  main  islands  of  Hokkaido,  Honshu, 
Shikoku,  and  Kyushu,  along  with  a  plethora  of  smaller  islands, 
and  is  separated  from  the  Asian  mainland  by  the  Sea  of  Japan  and 
bordered  on  the  east  by  the  Pacific  Ocean  (see  fig.  1).  Nearly  75 
percent  of  the  country's  land  surface  is  covered  by  mountains,  and 
the  climate,  although  generally  humid,  ranges  from  cool  in  the  north 
to  subtropical  in  the  south.  Historically,  when  Japan  was  a  pre- 
dominantly agricultural  country,  its  varied  climate  made  for  re- 
gional diversity  in  economy  and  culture,  and  its  insular  geography 
and  rugged  terrain  helped  it  limit  and  control  foreign  access.  Since 
World  War  II,  however,  as  Japanese  society  has  become  over- 
whelmingly urban,  industrial,  and  internationalized,  climatic  and 
geographical  effects  have  become  much  less  significant. 

The  origins  of  Japanese  civilization  are  buried  in  legend,  with 
the  country's  first  written  records  dating  from  the  sixth  to  the  eighth 
centuries  A.D.,  after  Japan  had  adopted  the  Chinese  writing  sys- 
tem. Early  in  the  sixth  century,  Chinese  Buddhism  was  introduced 
to  Japan  by  way  of  Korea,  and  with  it  came  many  Chinese  govern- 
mental and  fiscal  practices.  A  society  of  individual  military  rulers, 
each  responsible  for  his  own  area,  evolved  into  an  imperial  system

Introduction 


JAPAN  IN  1990  WAS  a  modern,  thriving  democracy,  yet  it  re- 
tained a  long  and  esteemed  imperial  tradition.  The  Japanese  took 
great  pride  in  being  "unique,"  yet  much  of  Japanese  civilization 
was  composed  of  selective  borrowings,  from  the  Chinese  written

ita gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary),  but  many  of  its 
people  were  crowded  into  inadequate  housing  lacking  such  basic 
amenities  as  indoor  plumbing.  Although  the  bushidd  (way  of  the 
warrior)  legacy  of  the  feudal  era  still  exerted  a  definite  influence 
on  modern  society,  the  ultranationalism  that  it  had  spawned  was 
repudiated  and  the  military  machine  that  earlier  in  the  twentieth 
century  had  conquered  much  of  the  Asia-Pacific  region  had  been 
replaced  by  streamlined  Self-Defense  Forces,  well  trained  but  under- 
equipped  and  barely  able  to  defend  the  home  islands. 

Japan  consists  of  the  four  main  islands  of  Hokkaido,  Honshu, 
Shikoku,  and  Kyushu,  along  with  a  plethora  of  smaller  islands, 
and  is  separated  from  the  Asian  mainland  by  the  Sea  of  Japan  and 
bordered  on  the  east  by  the  Pacific  Ocean  (see  fig.  1).  Nearly  75 
percent  of  the  country's  land  surface  is  covered  by  mountains,  and 
the  climate,  although  generally  humid,  ranges  from  cool  in  the  north 
to  subtropical  in  the  south.  Historically,  when  Japan  was  a  pre- 
dominantly agricultural  country,  its  varied  climate  made  for  re- 
gional diversity  in  economy  and  culture,  and  its  insular  geography 
and  rugged  terrain  helped  it  limit  and  control  foreign  access.  Since 
World  War  II,  however,  as  Japanese  society  has  become  over- 
whelmingly urban,  industrial,  and  internationalized,  climatic  and 
geographical  effects  have  become  much  less  significant. 

The  origins  of  Japanese  civilization  are  buried  in  legend,  with 
the  country's  first  written  records  dating  from  the  sixth  to  the  eighth 
centuries  A.D.,  after  Japan  had  adopted  the  Chinese  writing  sys- 
tem. Early  in  the  sixth  century,  Chinese  Buddhism  was  introduced 
to  Japan  by  way  of  Korea,  and  with  it  came  many  Chinese  govern- 
mental and  fiscal  practices.  A  society  of  individual  military  rulers, 
each  responsible  for  his  own  area,  evolved  into  an  imperial  system 


xxvii 


codified  in  the  Taiho-ryoritsu  (Great  Treasure  Code)  of  701.  Im- 
perial control  was  gradually  spread  throughout  the  main  island  of 
Honshu  and  eventually  to  all  of  Japan  by  military  conquest.  The 
leaders  of  these  conquests  were  rewarded  with  large  landholdings. 
By  the  tenth  century,  these  military  leaders  had  evolved  into  a  war- 
rior class — the  bushi  or  samurai — that  supplanted  the  central 
authority  of  the  emperor;  and  Japanese  society  evolved  into  a  feu- 
dal economy  with  the  large  landholdings  of  the  samurai  supported 
by  local  peasants,  artisans,  and  merchants.  Beginning  in  the  seven- 
teenth century,  the  Tokugawa  shoguns,  like  earlier  military  rulers 
under  the  same  title,  asserted  control  over  a  newly  reunified  Japan. 
They  also  closed  the  country  to  outside  influences  and  developed 
the  national  premodern  economy. 

When  Japan  was  reopened  in  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  cen- 
tury, the  traditional  political,  military,  and  economic  systems  were 
no  match  for  powerful  foreign  intruders,  and  the  shogun's  govern- 
ment failed.  It  was  replaced  by  a  new  oligarchy  of  strong  regional 
leaders  who  brought  about  the  Meiji  Restoration — the  ostensible 
restoration  of  imperial  power — in  1868.  The  Meiji  rulers  carried 
out  wholesale  radical  reforms.  The  government  hired  thousands 
of  foreigners  to  teach  modern  science,  mathematics,  and  foreign 
languages  and  sent  a  multitude  of  students  and  envoys  to  Europe 
and  North  America  to  learn  the  lessons  that  had  bypassed  them 
during  the  years  of  exclusion.  They  returned  to  combine  foreign 
ideology  and  modern  methods  with  Japanese  traditions,  devis- 
ing a  governmental  and  economic  system  that  was  totally  new  yet 
uniquely  Japanese.  The  government  also  built  factories  and  ship- 
yards to  help  private  businesses  get  started.  These  businesses  de- 
veloped rapidly  into  large  conglomerates,  some  of  which  dominated 
the  world  of  business  in  the  early  1990s.  Transportation  and  in- 
dustry were  modernized;  the  military  was  reorganized  and  equipped 
with  up-to-date  weapons;  and  under  the  1889  constitution,  Japan 
took  the  first  steps  toward  representative  government. 

For  the  remainder  of  the  nineteenth  century  and  into  the  twen- 
tieth century,  the  economy  grew  at  a  moderate  rate  although  it 
remained  heavily  dependent  on  agriculture.  After  the  development 
of  a  strong  economic  and  industrial  base  at  home,  successful  wars 
annexing  Taiwan  and  Korea,  and  the  growth  of  spheres  of  influence 
over  a  large  part  of  the  Chinese  mainland,  Japan  began  to  exert 
its  influence  throughout  the  Asia-Pacific  region.  In  the  late  1920s, 
industry  outstripped  agriculture,  and  in  the  1930s  industry,  little 
affected  by  the  Great  Depression  plaguing  the  rest  of  the  industri- 
alized world,  continued  to  grow.  Using  the  strong  Japanese  econ- 
omy to  support  their  imperialistic  designs,  ultranationalist  military 


xxvm 


officers  succeeded  in  stifling  the  young  democracy  and  took  con- 
trol of  the  government  in  the  name  of  the  emperor.  With  their  power 
unchecked,  the  militarist  government  led  the  nation  into  a  series 
of  military  conflicts  that  culminated  in  the  almost  total  destruc- 
tion of  the  nation  during  World  War  II. 

World  War  II  destroyed  nearly  half  of  Japan's  industry.  Japan's 
economy  was  completely  disrupted,  and  the  country  was  forced 
to  rely  on  United  States  assistance  and  imports  of  essential  food 
and  raw  material.  Large-scale  procurements  by  United  States  armed 
forces  during  the  Korean  War  (1950-53)  revived  Japanese  indus- 
try, and  the  country  invested  heavily  in  replacing  the  destroyed 
factories  with  modern,  well-equipped  factories.  By  the  mid-1950s, 
modern  plants  staffed  by  a  well-educated,  disciplined  work  force 
had  brought  the  Japanese  economy  back  to  pre- World  War  II  levels. 
For  the  remainder  of  the  1950s,  however,  Japan  endured  chronic 
trade  deficits.  Unhampered  by  large  military  expenditures,  the 
Japanese  economy  continued  to  grow  at  a  rapid  pace  into  the  next 
decade.  Japanese  trade  relations  improved  dramatically  during  the 
1960s,  attaining  a  favorable  balance,  and  Japanese  industry  felt 
confident  enough  to  compete  in  the  international  market  in  such 
heavy  industrial  products  as  automobiles,  ships,  and  machine  tools. 

The  Ministry  of  International  Trade  and  Industry  (MITI), 
formed  in  1949,  played  a  major  role  in  the  1950s  and  1960s  in  for- 
mulating and  implementing  Japan's  international  trade  policy,  as- 
sisting the  development  of  domestic  industry  and  protecting  it  from 
foreign  competition.  MITI's  authority  gradually  decreased  as  pri- 
vate industry  and  other  ministries  took  more  responsibility  on  them- 
selves. By  the  late  1980s,  MITI's  control  over  international  trade 
policy  was  greatly  reduced.  The  Japan  External  Trade  Organiza- 
tion (JETRO)  was  established  by  MITI  in  1958  to  promote  Japan's 
external  trade.  Over  the  years  JETRO 's  role  diversified;  it  went 
from  promoting  exports  to  fostering  all  aspects  of  Japan's  trade 
relations  and  enhancing  understanding  with  trading  partners. 

In  the  immediate  postwar  period,  the  operations  of  Japanese 
financial  institutions  were  severely  restricted.  In  the  1970s,  con- 
trols began  to  loosen,  and  these  institutions  rapidly  expanded  their 
international  activities.  By  the  late  1980s,  they  were  major  inter- 
national players,  opening  branches  abroad  to  foster  foreign  invest- 
ments and  making  Tokyo  a  world  financial  center.  During  the  late 
1980s,  Japan  became  the  world's  largest  creditor  nation  and  was 
home  to  some  of  the  world's  largest  banking  and  financial  institu- 
tions. Japanese  securities  firms  played  a  major  role  in  international 
finances  and  were  members  of  major  world  stock  exchanges.  In 
1988  the  Tokyo  Securities  and  Stock  Exchange  became  the  world's 


xxix 


largest,  while  the  Osaka  Stock  Exchange  ranked  third  behind  Tokyo 
and  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange.  Beginning  in  1986,  the  Tokyo 
exchange  permitted  foreign  brokerage  firms  to  be  members.  Japan 
also  played  an  increasing  role  in  international  economic  organiza- 
tions and  agreements,  especially  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and 
the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade.  Japan  has  a  strong 
private  enterprise  economy,  although  public  corporations  played 
a  very  important  role  in  the  early  postwar  period.  By  the  1980s, 
however,  their  role  was  considerably  decreased,  and  some  of  the 
largest  were  privatized.  The  thriving  private  enterprise  sector  was 
dominated  by  large  corporations  with  affiliated  smaller  firms. 
Labor-management  relations  were  generally  harmonious,  and  labor 
productivity  was  high. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Japan  squeezed  nearly  124  million  people  into 
less  than  400,000  square  kilometers  of  land,  much  of  which  was 
uninhabitable.  But  population  growth,  rapid  in  the  last  half  of  the 
nineteenth  century  and  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth  century,  had 
slowed  drastically  by  the  1980s.  This  low  fertility  rate,  combined 
with  high  life  expectancy,  was  making  Japan  a  rapidly  aging  soci- 
ety, placing  an  increasing  burden  on  the  shrinking  working-age 
population. 

Women  traditionally  had  occupied  an  inferior  position  in 
Japanese  society.  Even  though  they  were  given  the  right  to  vote 
in  1946  and  were  accorded  equal  rights  under  the  1947  Constitu- 
tion and  the  Civil  Code  of  1948,  their  general  status  did  not  sig- 
nificantly improve.  As  Japan  faced  a  shrinking  work  force  in  the 
1980s  and  1990s,  however,  increasing  numbers  of  women  were 
brought  into  the  labor  market,  resulting  in  improved  educational, 
political,  and  economic  opportunities.  Nevertheless,  women's  status 
still  remained  far  short  of  that  for  men. 

Japan  promoted  exports  by  developing  world-class  industries  and 
providing  incentives  for  firms  to  export.  In  the  postwar  period, 
export  incentives  mainly  took  the  form  of  tax  relief  and  govern- 
ment assistance  to  build  export  industries  along  with  heavy  im- 
port barriers.  As  Japanese  industry  regained  its  strength  in  the 
1960s,  the  government  gradually  liberalized  its  trade  policy,  and 
tax  incentives  were  eliminated.  In  the  1970s,  a  strong  rise  in  the 
value  of  the  yen  (for  value  of  the  yen — see  Glossary)  under  the  new 
system  of  floating  exchange  rates  and  the  oil  price  shocks  of  1973 
and  1979  brought  large  trade  deficits.  The  situation  spurred  Japan 
to  reduce  its  dependence  on  unreliable  foreign  petroleum  by  con- 
servation and  diversification  of  sources  and  to  sharply  increase  its 
exports  to  offset  the  high  costs  of  raw  materials.  In  the  1980s,  with 
the  dramatic  drop  in  the  cost  of  raw  materials,  Japan  developed 


xxx 


a  large  trade  surplus.  Export  policy  shifted  to  export  restraints  on 
certain  products  that  were  causing  the  greatest  tensions  with  trad- 
ing partners,  and  Japan  greatly  increased  its  foreign  investment. 
This  trend  continued  through  the  1980s.  Japan  continued  to  be 
the  target  of  complaints  from  trading  partners,  however,  especial- 
ly for  nontariff  barriers  such  as  standards,  testing  procedures,  and 
restrictive  distribution  practices. 

In  the  1980s,  manufactured  imports  still  made  up  a  share  of  the 
gross  national  product  far  below  that  of  other  developed  countries, 
and  in  1989  Japan  was  named  an  unfair  trading  partner  by  the 
United  States  government.  Although  certain  Japanese  industries, 
such  as  automobile  manufacturing,  were  heavily  export  oriented, 
Japan  exported  a  lower  percentage  of  its  GNP  than  most  major 
industrialized  nations.  During  the  1960s  and  1970s,  import  growth 
kept  up  with  exports,  but  in  the  1980s,  import  growth  fell  off  drasti- 
cally, leading  to  large  trade  surpluses.  The  United  States  was  the 
largest  single  destination  of  Japanese  exports  (34  percent  in  1988) 
as  well  as  its  largest  single  source  of  imports  (22.4  percent).  Japan's 
major  international  industries  in  the  late  1980s  were  motor  vehi- 
cles, consumer  electronics,  computers,  semiconductors  and  other 
electronic  components,  and  iron  and  steel.  The  rapid  increase  in 
the  value  of  the  yen  in  the  late  1980s  made  Japanese  exports  less 
price  competitive  and  imports  more  price  competitive,  but  it  was 
unclear  in  1990  what  effect  the  increased  value  of  the  yen  would 
have  on  the  balance  of  trade  in  the  long  term. 

Japan  has  traditionally  run  a  deficit  in  services:  transportation, 
insurance,  travel  expenditures,  royalties,  licensing  fees,  and  income 
from  investment.  In  the  early  1980s,  however,  this  deficit  was  some- 
what offset  by  the  rapid  growth  of  Japanese  foreign  investment. 
In  the  late  1980s,  increased  travel  expenses  again  produced  a 
marked  increase  in  the  services  deficit  despite  a  rapid  growth  in 
foreign  investments.  Although  most  barriers  to  foreign  investment 
were  removed  in  the  1980s,  Japan's  heavy  investment  in  other  coun- 
tries remained  a  major  cause  of  tension  with  those  countries. 

Japan's  foreign  aid  program,  begun  in  the  1960s  as  World  War 
II  reparations  to  other  Asian  countries,  grew  rapidly  during  the 
1980s.  In  the  late  1980s,  Japanese  assistance  consisted  of  bilateral 
grants  and  loans  as  well  as  support  to  multilateral  aid  organizations. 

Japan,  one  of  the  world's  most  literate  nations,  places  great  value 
on  education.  It  provides  children  with  compulsory  free  education 
from  first  grade  through  ninth  grade.  A  high  percentage  of  chil- 
dren also  attends  preschools  and  continues  through  into  upper- 
secondary  and  higher  education.  Educational  standards  are  high, 
and  Japanese  students  consistently  finish  at  or  near  the  top  in 


xxxi 


international  academic  tests.  Teachers  are  held  in  great  esteem  by 
Japanese  society  and  are  charged  with  imparting  sound  moral  values 
to  their  students  along  with  academic  information.  Any  antisocial 
behavior  on  or  off  campus  is  considered  to  reflect  on  the  teacher. 
Entrance  to  higher  education  is  by  examination  and  is  extremely 
competitive,  causing  great  stress  to  students  trying  to  get  into  the 
"right"  school.  Education  rarely  ends  with  graduation  from  the 
formal  school  system.  Japan  also  has  extensive,  well-utilized  adult 
education. 

The  Japanese  have  shown  widespread  interest  in  their  tradi- 
tional culture:  the  tea  ritual,  calligraphy,  flower  arranging,  and  No, 
Kabuki,  and  bunraku  (puppet)  theater,  as  well  as  classical  works 
of  art.  At  the  same  time,  educated  Japanese  are  expected  to  have 
a  good  understanding  of  classical  Western  music  and  art,  and 
modern  Western  music,  drama,  and  art  have  been  imported  and 
adapted  to  develop  distinctive  new  Japanese  forms.  In  addition, 
extensive  print  and  broadcast  media  provide  information  and  en- 
tertainment. 

The  Japanese  do  not  consider  themselves  a  religious  people.  Their 
world  view,  however,  is  guided  by  a  basic  philosophy  deeply  rooted 
in  ancient  Shinto  beliefs  on  human  origins  and  relations  with  the 
spirit  world,  modified  by  later  adaptations  of  Confucian  ideas  on 
societal  relationships  and  order  and  Buddhist  concepts  of  karmic 
causation  and  an  afterlife.  Japanese  are  very  conscious  of  their  po- 
sition in  society  and  the  various  roles  that  they  are  expected  to  play 
throughout  their  lives.  They  put  a  high  premium  on  social  har- 
mony and  will  go  to  great  pains  to  avoid  bringing  disgrace  on  their 
families  and  other  groups  with  which  they  are  associated  by  dis- 
rupting that  harmony.  For  this  reason,  more  than  any  other,  in 
1990  the  overall  crime  rate  remained  quite  low  in  comparison  with 
other  major  industrialized  nations,  and  Japanese  cities  were  among 
the  safest  in  the  world. 

The  1947  Constitution,  with  its  stipulation  of  a  symbolic  role 
for  the  emperor,  guarantees  of  civil  and  human  rights,  and  renun- 
ciation of  war,  remained  the  operative  basis  for  Japanese  govern- 
ment in  1990.  By  pragmatic  collaboration  with  big  business,  small 
business,  agriculture,  and  professional  groups,  the  LDP  has  domi- 
nated Japanese  politics  since  it  was  formed  as  a  coalition  of  smaller 
conservative  groups  in  1955.  Although  LDP  fortunes  have  risen 
and  ebbed  over  the  years  since  its  establishment,  no  opposition  party 
has  been  able  to  oust  it  from  power.  On  occasions,  such  as  the  Lock- 
heed bribery  scandal  in  the  mid-1970s  and  the  Recruit  influence- 
peddling  scandal  of  1988-89,  LDP  dominance  appeared  to  be  in 
danger.  In  the  upper  house  (House  of  Councillors)  elections  of  July 


xxxn 


1989,  the  LDP  actually  became  the  minority  party  behind  the  Japan 
Socialist  Party  and  a  coalition  of  smaller  opposition  groups.  But 
voters  have  continued  to  give  the  LDP  control  of  the  more  power- 
ful lower  house  (House  of  Representatives).  This  fact  results  as 
much  from  the  opposition's  inability  to  present  a  viable  alterna- 
tive as  from  popular  support  for  the  LDP.  The  voters  have  preferred 
to  chastise  the  LDP  for  its  mistakes  rather  than  to  oust  the  party. 

In  the  postwar  period,  Japan  concentrated  on  rebuilding  its  econ- 
omy, attempted  to  cultivate  friendly  ties  with  all  nations,  and  re- 
lied on  the  United  States  for  military  security.  By  the  1970s,  this 
foreign  policy  began  to  be  called  into  question  as  Japan  came  into 
its  own  as  a  world  economic  power.  In  the  1980s,  Japan  became 
a  leading  industrial  nation,  the  world's  largest  creditor  nation  and 
largest  donor  of  foreign  aid,  and  a  major  actor  in  international  finan- 
cial institutions  such  as  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary)  and  the  In- 
ternational Monetary  Fund  (see  Glossary).  As  it  entered  the  1990s, 
people  at  home  and  abroad  expected  Japan  to  play  a  diplomatic 
role  proportionate  to  its  economic  power  and  its  role  in  foreign  as- 
sistance, trade,  and  investment.  But  popular  sentiment  in  Japan 
and  its  Asian  neighbors  continued  strongly  to  oppose  Japan's  as- 
suming the  military  role  expected  of  a  world  power. 

Because  of  their  tragic  experience  with  a  military-controlled 
government  before  and  during  World  War  II,  the  Japanese  peo- 
ple readily  accepted  the  military  restrictions  written  into  the  1947 
Constitution  at  the  insistence  of  occupation  forces  and,  even  in  1990, 
generally  interpreted  Article  9  of  the  Constitution  as  forbidding 
the  Japanese  Self-Defense  Forces  from  being  deployed  outside  of 
the  country  or  possessing  nuclear  weapons.  Japan  still  depended 
on  the  1960  Treaty  of  Mutual  Cooperation  and  Security  with  the 
United  States,  which  mandated  the  United  States  to  come  to  its 
aid  in  the  event  of  a  large-scale  invasion  and  allowed  for  United 
States  provision  of  a  nuclear  umbrella.  There  is  little  popular  sen- 
timent for  change  in  this  arrangement. 

As  Japan  moved  toward  the  twenty-first  century,  it  was  faced 
with  a  series  of  dilemmas.  How  could  it  continue  to  grow  as  a  world 
economic  leader  without  assuming  a  greater  political  role?  And, 
how  could  it  be  considered  a  political  leader  when  it  could  not  even 
provide  for  the  security  of  its  own  territory  without  foreign  as- 
sistance? Its  trading  partners  complained  that  Japan  enjoyed  an 
unfair  advantage.  Yet  when  Japanese  firms  invested  in  their  econ- 
omies, they  raised  the  specter  of  Japanese  domination.  Each  in- 
ternational crisis  found  Western  powers  calling  on  Japan  to 
"contribute  its  fair  share"  to  the  peacekeeping  forces.  At  the  same 
time,  the  Japanese  people  and  their  Asian  neighbors,  remembering 


xxxiii 


the  terrible  lessons  of  World  War  II,  demanded  that  there  be  no 
foreign  projection  of  Japanese  military  power.  With  less  than  ten 
years  until  the  next  century,  Japan  had  yet  to  come  to  grips  with 
these  questions.  The  answers  seemed  far  off. 

January  22,  1991 

*    *  * 

As  the  manuscript  for  this  book  was  being  completed,  the 
Japanese  economy  continued  to  grow  at  a  healthy  rate.  After  a  weak 
2.6  percent  annualized  growth  in  GNP  in  the  fourth  quarter  of 

1990,  the  GNP  jumped  to  an  11.2  percent  annualized  growth  in 
the  first  quarter  of  1991.  But  the  fact  that  more  than  half  of  this 
increase  came  from  exports  seemed  to  indicate  that  overall  growth 
for  1991  would  slow  considerably  from  the  first  quarter  figure. 

Japan's  tardiness  in  providing  promised  support  to  the  United 
States-led  coalition  forces  opposing  the  Iraqi  occupation  of  Kuwait 
exacerbated  already  tense  Japanese-United  States  trade  relations. 
In  March  1991,  Japan's  legislature,  the  National  Diet,  finally  ap- 
proved the  US$13  billion  promised  several  months  earlier,  reliev- 
ing some  of  the  tension  in  Japanese-United  States  relations.  With 
the  attention  of  Congress  and  the  American  public  diverted  to  other 
areas  of  the  world,  Japanese  and  United  States  government  offi- 
cials were  able  to  quietly  negotiate  a  trade  agreement  on  semicon- 
ductors and  an  agreement  to  open  Japanese  construction  projects 
to  United  States  companies.  Japan's  refusal  to  open  up  its  rice  market 
to  foreign  suppliers  remained  a  serious  problem  for  agricultural  trade. 

Although  the  Kaifu  administration  in  November  1990  was  un- 
successful in  getting  Diet  authorization  for  the  Self-Defense  Forces 
to  participate  in  peacekeeping  operations,  in  early  February  1991 
the  Japanese  government  dispatched  military  transport  aircraft  to 
evacuate  refugees  from  the  Persian  Gulf  war  from  Jordan  and  Syria 
to  Egypt  at  the  request  of  the  United  Nations  International  Or- 
ganization for  Migration.  After  the  war,  Japan  sent  a  small  flo- 
tilla of  four  Maritime  Self-Defense  Force  minesweepers  and  two 
support  ships  to  the  Gulf  to  clear  Iraqi  mines.  In  the  summer  of 

1991 ,  the  Kaifu  administration  drafted  a  new  proposal  setting  aside 
a  force  of  1,000  troops  and  50  cease-fire  monitors  to  be  available 
for  United  Nations  peacekeeping  operations.  The  proposal  appeared 
to  have  substantial  public  support. 

On  July  18,1991,  after  several  months  of  difficult  negotiations, 
Prime  Minister  Kaifu  Toshiki  signed  a  joint  statement  with  the 


xxxiv 


Dutch  prime  minister,  Ruud  Lubbers,  head  of  the  European  Com- 
munity Council,  and  the  European  Commission  president,  Jacques 
Delors,  pledging  closer  Japanese-European  Community  consulta- 
tions on  foreign  relations,  scientific  and  technological  cooperation, 
assistance  to  developing  countries,  and  efforts  to  reduce  trade  con- 
flicts. Japanese  foreign  ministry  officials  hoped  that  this  agreement 
would  help  to  broaden  Japanese-European  Community  political 
links  and  raise  them  above  the  narrow  confines  of  trade  disputes. 

The  much  heralded  visit  to  Japan  of  Soviet  president  and  general 
secretary  of  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union  Mikhail 
Gorbachev  occurred  in  April  1991.  Although  Gorbachev  and  Kaifu 
signed  several  low-level  agreements  on  environmental  protection, 
nuclear  energy,  and  cultural  exchanges,  they  made  no  progress  in 
resolving  the  main  obstacle  to  Japanese-Soviet  relations,  the  Soviet 
Union's  continued  occupation  of  Shikotan,  Etorofu,  Kunashiri, 
and  the  Habomai  Islands  north  of  Hokkaido.  In  September  1991, 
Gorbachev  resigned  as  general  secretary  of  the  communist  party 
and  his  government  was  in  transition,  causing  further  uncertain- 
ties about  that  government's  relations  with  Japan  and  other  nations. 

In  the  early  1990s,  the  Japanese  government  was  making  a  con- 
certed effort  to  enhance  its  diplomatic  stature,  especially  in  Asia. 
Kaifu 's  much  publicized  spring  1991  tour  of  five  Southeast  Asian 
nations — Malaysia,  Brunei,  Thailand,  Singapore,  and  the  Philip- 
pines— culminated  in  a  May  3  major  foreign  policy  address  in  Sin- 
gapore, in  which  he  called  for  a  new  partnership  with  the  Association 
of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  and  pledged  that  Japan  would 
go  beyond  the  purely  economic  sphere  to  seek  an  "appropriate  role 
in  the  political  sphere  as  a  nation  of  peace."  As  evidence  of  this 
new  role,  Japan  took  an  active  part  in  promoting  negotiations  to 
resolve  the  Cambodian  conflict. 

In  Northeast  Asia,  Japan  conducted  lengthy  negotiations  with 
the  Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea)  aimed 
at  establishing  diplomatic  relations  with  P'yongyang  while  main- 
taining its  relations  with  Seoul.  The  Japanese  government  also  re- 
vived Sino-Japanese  exchanges  and  offered  support  to  Mongolia's 
political  and  economic  restructuring.  In  January  1991,  Japan  began 
normalization  talks  with  P'yongyang  with  a  formal  apology  for  its 
1910-45  colonial  rule  of  the  Korean  Peninsula.  The  negotiations 
were  aided  by  Tokyo's  support  of  a  proposal  for  simultaneous  en- 
try to  the  United  Nations  by  North  Korea  and  the  Republic  of 
Korea  (South  Korea);  the  issues  of  international  inspection  of  North 
Korean  nuclear  facilities  and  the  nature  and  amount  of  Japanese 
economic  assistance,  however,  proved  more  difficult  to  negotiate.

Japan  took  the  lead  in  restoring  trade  and  economic  agreements 
with  China,  suspended  following  Beijing's  June  1989  Tiananmen 
Incident.  Japan-China  trade,  which  began  to  recover  in  Septem- 
ber 1990,  increased  rapidly  in  1991.  In  March  1991,  the  Japan 
Export-Import  Bank  resumed  loans  to  China,  and  in  April  Japan 
announced  its  support  for  restoration  of  Asian  Development  Bank 
loans  to  China.  A  series  of  unilateral  and  multilateral  loans  followed. 

Frequent  meetings  between  high-level  Japanese  and  Chinese 
government  officials  also  took  place  in  1991.  In  March  Japanese 
foreign  ministry  officials  met  in  Tokyo  with  Chinese  foreign  ministry 
officials  to  discuss  a  wide  range  of  bilateral  and  international  is- 
sues; in  May  former  prime  ministers  Nakasone  Yasuhiro  and 
Takeshita  Noboru,  in  Beijing  to  attend  the  opening  of  a  Japan- 
China  youth  center,  met  with  leading  Chinese  officials;  and  in  June 
the  Chinese  minster  of  foreign  affairs,  Qian  Qichen,  visited  Tokyo. 
The  culmination  of  government-to- government  exchanges  came 
with  Prime  Minister  Kaifu's  August  1991  visit  to  Beijing,  the  first 
by  a  leader  of  a  major  industrialized  nation  since  the  Tiananmen 
Incident.  During  the  visit,  Kaifu  discussed  a  full  range  of  bilateral 
and  international  issues  with  Chinese  leaders  and  offered  substan- 
tial economic  assistance.  Kaifu  also  visited  Ulaanbaatar  and  offered 
Japanese  encouragement  and  financial  support  to  Mongolia's  ef- 
forts to  reorganize  its  government  and  economy. 

The  political  fortunes  of  leading  Japanese  political  figures  changed 
in  1991.  Doi  Takako,  who  in  late  1989  and  early  1990  had  been 
considered  a  possible  candidate  for  prime  minister  on  the  strength 
of  her  Japan  Socialist  Party's  victory  in  the  July  1989  House  of  Coun- 
cilors election,  resigned  her  post  in  late  July  1991  following  the  party's 
crushing  defeat  in  local  elections.  And,  in  October  Prime  Minster 
Kaifu,  despite  his  high  rating  with  the  Japanese  public,  announced 
that  he  would  not  run  for  another  term  as  president  of  the  LDP 
when  he  failed  to  attain  Diet  passage  of  a  political  reform  bill  and 
lost  the  support  of  powerful  LDP  factions.  Miyazawa  Kiichi,  a  strong 
political  figure  whose  career  dates  from  World  War  II  and  the  United 
States  occupation,  was  elected  president  of  the  LDP  on  October  27, 
1991,  and  prime  minister  on  November  5.  On  December  7,  Prime 
Minister  Miyazawa  indicated  that  Japan  felt  'deep  responsibility' 
for  the  suffering  that  it  inflicted  in  World  War  II,  but  believed  that 
it  had  atoned  for  its  conduct  by  its  contribution  to  peace  and  prosperi- 
ty since  the  war.  It  remained  to  be  seen,  however,  what  general 
policy  changes  the  Miyazawa  administration  would  bring  to  Japan 
and  its  relations  with  the  rest  of  the  world.

' '  NOTHING  SIMILAR  MAY  be  found  in  foreign  lands, ' '  wrote 
Kitabatake  Chikafusa  when  he  described  Japan  in  his  fourteenth- 
century  Jinno  shoto  ki  (Chronicle  of  the  Direct  Descent  of  the  Di- 
vine Sovereigns).  Although  Japan's  culture  developed  late  in  Asian 
terms  and  was  much  influenced  by  China  and  later  the  West,  its 
history,  like  its  art  and  literature,  is  special  among  world  civiliza- 
tions. As  some  scholars  have  argued,  these  outside  influences  may 
have  "corrupted"  Japanese  traditions,  yet  once  absorbed  they  also 
enriched  and  strengthened  the  nation,  forming  part  of  a  vibrant 
and  unique  culture. 

Early  in  Japan's  history,  society  was  controlled  by  a  ruling  elite 
of  powerful  clans.  The  most  powerful  emerged  as  a  kingly  line  and 
later  as  the  imperial  family  in  Yamato  (modern  Nara  Prefecture 
or  possibly  in  northern  Kyushu)  in  the  third  century  A.D. ,  claim- 
ing descent  from  the  gods  who  created  Japan.  An  imperial  court 
and  government,  shaped  by  Chinese  political  and  social  institu- 
tions, were  established.  Often  powerful  court  families  effected  a 
hereditary  regency,  having  established  control  over  the  .emperor. 
The  highly  developed  culture  attained  between  the  eighth  and  the 
twelfth  centuries  was  followed  by  a  long  period  of  anarchy  and  civil 
war,  and  a  feudal  society  developed  in  which  military  overlords 
ran  the  government  on  behalf  of  the  emperor,  his  court,  and  the 
regent.  Although  the  Yamato  (see  Glossary)  court  continued  con- 
trol of  the  throne,  in  practice  a  succession  of  dynastic  military  re- 
gimes ruled  the  now-decentralized  country.  In  the  late  sixteenth 
century,  Japan  began  a  process  of  reunification  followed  by  a  period 
of  great  stability  and  peace,  in  which  contact  with  the  outside  world 
was  limited  and  tightly  controlled  by  the  government. 

Confronted  by  the  West — inopportunely  during  the  economically 
troubled  late  eighteenth  and  early  nineteenth  centuries — Japan 
emerged  gradually  as  a  modern,  industrial  power,  exhibiting  some 
democratic  institutions  by  the  end  of  World  War  I.  Beginning  in 
the  mid-nineteenth  century,  phenomenal  social  upheaval,  accom- 
panied by  political,  military,  and  economic  successes,  led  to  an  over- 
abundance of  nationalist  pride  and  extremist  solutions,  and  to  even 
faster  modernization.  Representative  government  was  finally  replaced 
by  increasingly  authoritarian  regimes,  which  propelled  Japan  into 
World  War  II.  After  the  cataclysm  of  nuclear  war,  Japan  rebuilt 
itself  based  on  a  new  and  earnest  desire  for  peaceful  development,

becoming  an  economic  superpower  in  the  second  half  of  the  twen- 
tieth century. 

Early  Developments 

Ancient  Cultures 

The  literature  of  Shinto  (Way  of  the  Gods;  see  Religious  and 
Philsophical  Traditons,  ch.  2)  employs  much  mythology  to  describe 
the  supposed  historical  origins  of  Japan.  According  to  the  creation 
story  found  in  the  Kojiki  (Record  of  Ancient  Matters,  dating  from 
712  A.  D.)  and  the  Nihongi  or  Nihon  shoki  (Chronicle  of  Japan,  from 
720  A.D.),  the  Japanese  islands  were  created  by  the  gods,  two  of 
whom —  the  male  Izanagi  and  the  female  Izanami — descended  from 
heaven  to  carry  out  the  task.  They  also  brought  into  being  other 
kami  (deities  or  supernatural  forces),  such  as  those  influencing  the 
sea,  rivers,  wind,  woods,  and  mountains.  Two  of  these  deities,  the 
Sun  Goddess,  Amaterasu  Omikami,  and  her  brother,  the  Storm 
God,  Susano-o,  warred  against  each  other,  with  Amaterasu  emerg- 
ing victorious. 

Subsequently  Amaterasu  sent  her  grandson,  Ninigi,  to  rule  over 
the  sacred  islands.  Ninigi  took  with  him  what  became  the  three 
imperial  regalia — a  curved  jewel  (magatama),  a  mirror,  and  a  "sword 
of  gathered  clouds" — and  ruled  over  the  island  of  Kyushu  (see 
fig.  1).  Ninigi's  great-grandson,  Jimmu,  recognized  as  the  first 
human  emperor  of  Japan,  set  out  to  conquer  Yamato.  On  the  main 
island  of  Honshu,  according  to  tradition,  he  established  the  un- 
broken line  of  imperial  descent  from  the  Sun  Goddess  and  founded 
the  Land  of  the  Rising  Sun  in  660  B.C. 

Archaeological  evidence  shows  some  human  activity  as  early 
as  30,000  B.C.,  when  the  islands  were  connected  glacially  to  the 
Asian  mainland.  The  first  modern  inhabitants  of  Japan,  however, 
are  thought  to  have  been  relative  latecomers,  arriving  from  diverse 
points  of  the  eastern  Pacific  rim  by  around  10,000  B.C. 

Of  these  prehistoric  people,  those  who  left  the  clearest  record 
were  members  of  the  heterogeneous  Jomon  culture  (ca.  10,000- 
300  B.C.)  who  made  by  3,000  B.C.  clay  pottery  impressed  with 
rope  or  cord  patterns  (Jomon  means  "patterns  of  plaited  cord") 
with  a  growing  sophistication.  These  people  also  used  chipped  stone 
tools  and  were  hunters,  gatherers,  and  skillful  coastal  and  deep- 
water  fishermen.  They  practiced  a  rudimentary  form  of  agriculture 
and  lived  in  caves  and  later  in  temporary  shallow  pit  dwellings, 
leaving  rich  kitchen  middens  for  modern  anthropological  study. 
Many  elements  of  Japanese  culture,  such  as  Shinto  mythology,  mar- 
riage customs,  and  architectural  styles,  may  date  from  the  end

of  this  period  and  reflect  a  mingled  migration  from  northern  Asian 
and  southern  Pacific  areas. 

Some  developments  of  the  next  cultural  period,  the  Yayoi,  are  at- 
tributed to  Chinese  and  Korean  influences.  The  Yayoi  culture 
(named  after  the  section  of  Tokyo  where  archaeological  investiga- 
tions uncovered  its  traces)  flourished  between  about  300  B.C.  and 
A.D.  300  from  southern  Kyushu  to  northern  Honshu.  The  earli- 
est of  these  people,  who  are  thought  to  have  migrated  from  Korea 
to  northern  Kyushu  and  intermixed  with  the  Jomon,  also  used 
chipped  stone  tools.  Although  the  pottery  of  the  Yayoi  was  more 
technologically  advanced — produced  on  a  potter's  wheel — it  was 
more  simply  decorated  than  Jomon  ware.  The  Yayoi  made  bronze 
ceremonial  nonfunctional  bells,  mirrors,  and  weapons,  and  by  the 
first  century  A.D.,  iron  agricultural  tools  and  weapons.  They  wove 
cloth,  lived  in  permanent  farming  villages,  constructed  buildings 
of  wood  and  stone,  accumulated  wealth  through  land  ownership 
and  the  storage  of  grain,  and  developed  distinct  social  classes.  Their 
irrigated,  wet-rice  culture  was  similar  to  that  of  central  and  south 
China,  requiring  a  heavy  input  of  human  labor,  which  led  to  the 
development  and  eventual  growth  of  a  highly  sedentary  society. 
Unlike  China,  which  had  to  undertake  massive  public  works  and 
water-control  projects,  leading  to  a  highly  centralized  government, 


5 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Japan  had  abundant  water.  In  Japan,  then,  local  political  and  so- 
cial developments  were  relatively  more  important  than  the  activi- 
ties of  the  central  authority  and  a  stratified  society. 

Kofun  Period,  ca.  A.D.  300-710 

New  continental  influences,  such  as  the  extensive  use  of  iron, 
characterized  the  next  historical  period.  The  Kofun,  or  old  tomb, 
period  (ca.  A.D.  300-710,  also  known  as  the  Yamato  period),  takes 
its  name  from  the  culture's  distinctive  earthen  funeral  mounds  with 
large  stone  burial  chambers,  many  of  which  were  keyhole  shaped. 
During  this  time,  a  highly  aristocratic  society  with  militaristic  rul- 
ers developed.  Its  horse-riding  warriors  wore  armor,  carried  swords 
and  other  weapons,  and  used  advanced  military  methods  like  those 
of  Northeast  Asia.  Evidence  of  these  advances  is  seen  in  haniwa 
(literally,  clay  rings)  funerary  figures  found  in  thousands  of  tombs 
scattered  throughout  the  area.  The  figures  are  portrayed  using  a 
wide  variety  of  musical  instruments,  weapons,  modes  of  convey- 
ance, and  so  forth.  Another  funerary  piece,  the  magatama,  became 
one  of  the  symbols  of  the  power  of  the  imperial  house. 

The  Kofun  period  was  a  critical  stage  in  Japan's  evolution  toward 
a  more  cohesive  and  recognized  state.  This  society  was  most  devel- 
oped in  the  easternmost  part  of  the  Inland  Sea  (Seto  Naikai),  and 
its  armies  established  a  foothold  on  the  southern  tip  of  Korea. 
Japan's  rulers  of  the  time  even  petitioned  the  Chinese  court  for 
confirmation  of  royal  titles;  the  Chinese,  in  turn,  recognized 
Japanese  military  control  over  parts  of  the  Korean  Peninsula.  The 
earliest  written  records  about  Japan  are  from  Chinese  sources  from 
this  period.  Wa  (the  Japanese  pronunciation  of  an  early  Chinese 
name  for  Japan)  was  first  mentioned  in  A.D.  57.  Early  Chinese 
historians  described  Wa  as  a  land  of  hundreds  of  scattered  tribal 
communities,  not  the  unified  land  with  a  700-year  tradition  as  laid 
out  in  the  Nihongi,  which  puts  the  foundation  of  Japan  at  660  B.C. 
Third-century  Chinese  sources  reported  that  the  Wa  people  lived 
on  raw  vegetables,  rice,  and  fish  served  on  bamboo  and  wooden 
trays,  had  vassal-master  relations,  collected  taxes,  had  provincial 
granaries  and  markets,  clapped  their  hands  in  worship  (something 
still  done  in  Shinto  shrines),  had  violent  succession  struggles,  built 
earthen  grave  mounds,  and  observed  mourning.  Himiko,  a  female 
ruler  of  an  early  political  federation  known  as  Yamatai,  flourished 
during  the  third  century.  While  Himiko  reigned  as  spiritual  leader, 
her  younger  brother  carried  out  affairs  of  state,  which  included 
diplomatic  relations  with  the  court  of  the  Chinese  Wei  Dynasty 
(A.D.  220-65). 

The  Yamato  polity,  which  emerged  in  the  mid-Kofun  period, 
was  distinguished  by  powerful  great  clans  or  extended  families,  each 


6

with  its  dependents.  Each  clan  was  headed  by  a  patriarch  who  per- 
formed sacred  rites  to  the  clan's  kami  to  ensure  the  long-term  wel- 
fare of  the  clan.  Clan  members  were  the  aristocracy,  and  the  kingly 
line  that  controlled  the  Yamato  court  was  at  its  pinacle. 

By  the  fifth  century  A.D.,  the  Yamato  court  was  concentrated 
in  Asuka,  near  modern  Nara,  and  exercised  power  over  clans  in 
Kyushu  and  Honshu,  bestowing  titles,  some  hereditary,  on  clan 
chieftains.  The  Yamato  name  became  synonomous  with  all  of  Japan 
as  the  Yamato  rulers  suppressed  the  clans  and  acquired  agricul- 
tural lands.  Based  on  Chinese  models  (including  the  adoption  of 
the  Chinese  written  language),  they  developed  a  central  adminis- 
tration and  an  imperial  court  attended  by  subordinate  clan  chief- 
tains but  with  no  permanent  capital.  By  the  mid- seventh  century, 
the  agricultural  lands  had  grown  to  a  substantial  public  domain, 
subject  to  central  policy.  The  basic  administrative  unit  was  the 
county,  and  society  was  organized  into  occupation  groups.  Most 
people  were  farmers;  other  were  fishers,  weavers,  potters,  artisans, 
armorers,  and  ritual  specialists. 

More  exchange  occurred  between  Japan  and  the  continent  of 
Asia  late  in  the  Kofun  period.  Buddhism  was  introduced  from 
Korea,  probably  in  A.D.  538,  exposing  Japan  to  a  new  body  of 
religious  doctrine.  The  Soga,  a  Japanese  court  family  that  rose  to 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


prominence  with  the  accession  of  the  Emperor  Kimmei  about  A.D. 
531,  favored  the  adoption  of  Buddhism  and  of  governmental  and 
cultural  models  based  on  Chinese  Confucianism.  But  some  at  the 
Yamato  court — such  as  the  Nakatomi  family,  which  was  responsi- 
ble for  performing  Shinto  rituals  at  court,  and  the  Mononobe,  a 
military  clan — were  set  on  maintaining  their  prerogatives  and  re- 
sisted the  alien  religious  influence  of  Buddhism.  The  Soga  in- 
troduced Chinese-modeled  fiscal  policies,  established  the  first 
national  treasury,  and  considered  the  Korean  Peninsula  a  trade 
route  rather  than  an  object  of  territorial  expansion.  Acrimony  con- 
tinued between  the  Soga  and  the  Nakatomi  and  Mononobe  clans 
for  more  than  a  century  during  which  the  Soga  temporarily  emerged 
ascendant. 

The  Soga  intermarried  with  the  imperial  family  and  by  A.D. 
587  Soga  Umako,  the  Soga  chieftain,  was  powerful  enough  to  in- 
stall his  nephew  as  emperor  and  later  to  assassinate  him  and  replace 
him  with  the  Empress  Suiko.  Suiko,  the  first  of  eight  sovereign 
empresses,  was  merely  a  figurehead  for  Umako  and  Prince  Re- 
gent Shotoku  Taishi  (A.D.  574-622).  Shotoku,  recognized  as  a  great 
intellectual  of  this  period  of  reform,  was  a  devout  Buddhist  well- 
read  in  Chinese  literature.  He  was  influenced  by  Confucian  prin- 
ciples, including  the  Mandate  of  Heaven,  which  suggested  that  the 
sovereign  ruled  at  the  will  of  a  supreme  force.  Under  Shotoku 's 
direction,  Confucian  models  of  rank  and  etiquette  were  adopted, 
and  his  Seventeen  Article  Constitution  (Kenpojushichijd)  prescribed 
ways  to  bring  harmony  to  a  society  chaotic  in  Confucian  terms. 
In  addition,  Shotoku  adopted  the  Chinese  calendar,  developed  a 
system  of  highways,  built  numerous  Buddhist  temples,  had  court 
chronicles  compiled,  sent  students  to  China  to  study  Buddhism  and 
Confucianism,  and  established  formal  diplomatic  relations  with 
China. 

Numerous  official  missions  of  envoys,  priests,  and  students  were 
sent  to  China  in  the  seventh  century.  Some  remained  twenty  years 
or  more;  many  of  those  who  returned  became  prominent  reform- 
ers. In  a  move  greatly  resented  by  the  Chinese,  Shotoku  sought 
equality  with  the  Chinese  emperor  by  addressing  a  memorial  "From 
the  Son  of  Heaven  in  the  Land  of  the  Rising  Sun  to  the  Son  of 
Heaven  of  the  Land  of  the  Setting  Sun."  Shotoku 's  bold  step  set 
a  precedent:  Japan  never  again  accepted  a  subordinate  status  in 
its  relations  with  China.  Although  the  missions  continued  the  trans- 
formation of  Japan  through  Chinese  influences,  the  Korean  in- 
fluence on  Japan  declined  despite  the  close  connections  there  had 
been  during  the  early  Kofun  period.

Historical  Setting 


About  twenty  years  after  the  deaths  of  Shotoku  (in  A.D.  622), 
Soga  Umako  (in  A.D.  626),  and  Empress  Suiko  (in  A.D.  628), 
court  intriques  over  the  succession  and  the  threat  of  a  Chinese  in- 
vasion led  to  a  palace  coup  against  the  Soga  oppression  in  645. 
The  revolt  was  led  by  Prince  Naka  and  Nakatomi  Kamatari,  who 
seized  control  of  the  court  from  the  Soga  family  and  introduced 
the  Taika  Reform  (Taika  means  great  change)  to  centralize  the 
state. 

The  Taika  Reform — influenced  by  Chinese  practices — started 
with  land  redistribution,  aimed  at  ending  the  existing  landholding 
system  of  the  great  clans  and  their  control  over  domains  and  oc- 
cupational groups.  What  were  once  called  "private  lands  and  pri- 
vate people' '  became  '  'public  lands  and  public  people, ' '  as  the  court 
now  sought  to  assert  its  control  over  all  of  Japan  and  to  make  the 
people  direct  subjects  of  the  throne.  Land  was  no  longer  heredi- 
tary but  reverted  to  the  state  at  the  death  of  the  owner.  Taxes  were 
levied  on  harvests  and  on  silk,  cotton,  cloth,  thread,  and  other 
products.  A  corvee  (labor)  tax  was  established  for  military  conscrip- 
tion and  building  public  works.  The  hereditary  titles  of  clan  chief- 
tains were  abolished,  and  three  ministries  were  established  to  advise 
the  throne  (the  minister  of  the  left,  minister  of  the  right,  and  minister 
of  the  center,  or  chancellor).  The  country  was  divided  into  provinces 
headed  by  governors  appointed  by  the  court,  and  the  provinces 
were  further  divided  into  districts  and  villages. 

Naka  assumed  the  position  of  minister  of  the  center,  and 
Kamatari  was  granted  a  new  family  name — Fujiwara — in  recog- 
nition of  his  great  service  to  the  imperial  family.  Fujiwara  Kamatari 
became  the  first  in  a  long  line  of  court  aristocrats.  Another,  long- 
lasting  change  was  the  use  of  the  name  Nippon  or  Nihon  (see  Glos- 
sary), or  sometimes  Dai  Nippon  (Great  Japan)  in  diplomatic  docu- 
ments and  chronicles.  Following  the  reigns  of  Naka's  uncle  and 
mother,  Naka  assumed  the  throne  as  Emperor  Tenji  in  662,  tak- 
ing the  additional  title  tenno  (heavenly  sovereign).  This  new  title 
was  intended  to  improve  the  Yamato  clan's  image  and  to  emphasize 
the  divine  origins  of  the  imperial  family  in  the  hope  of  keeping  it 
above  political  frays,  such  as  those  precipitated  by  the  Soga  clan. 
Within  the  imperial  family,  however,  power  struggles  continued 
as  the  emperor's  brother  and  son  vied  for  the  throne.  The  brother, 
who  later  reigned  as  Emperor  Temmu,  consolidated  Tenji' s  re- 
forms and  state  power  in  the  imperial  court. 

Reforms  were  further  consolidated  and  codified  in  A.D.  701 
under  the  Taiho-ryoritsu  (Great  Treasure  Code,  known  as  the 
Taiho  Code),  which,  except  for  a  few  modifications  and  being 
relegated  to  primarily  ceremonial  functions,  remained  in  force  until 


9 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

1868.  The  Taiho  Code  provided  for  Confucian-model  penal  pro- 
visions (light  rather  than  harsh  punishments)  and  Chinese-style  cen- 
tral administration  through  the  Department  of  Rites,  which  was 
devoted  to  Shinto  and  court  rituals,  and  the  Department  of  State, 
with  its  eight  ministries  (for  central  administration,  ceremonies, 
civil  affairs,  the  imperial  household,  justice,  military  affairs,  peo- 
ple's affairs,  and  the  treasury).  A  Chinese-style  civil  service  ex- 
amination system  based  on  the  Confucian  classics  was  also  adopted. 
Tradition  circumvented  the  system,  however,  as  aristocratic  birth 
continued  to  be  the  main  qualification  for  higher  position.  The 
Taiho  Code  did  not  address  the  selection  of  the  sovereign.  Several 
empresses  reigned  from  the  fifth  to  the  eighth  centuries,  but  after 
770  succession  was  restricted  to  males,  usually  from  father  to  son, 
although  sometimes  to  brother  or  uncle. 

Nara  and  Heian  Periods,  A.D.  710-1185 
Economic,  Social,  and  Administrative  Developments 

Before  the  Taiho  Code  was  established,  the  capital  was  custo- 
marily moved  after  the  death  of  an  emperor  because  of  the  ancient 
belief  that  a  place  of  death  was  polluted.  Reforms  and  bureaucra- 
tization of  government  led  to  the  establishment  of  a  permanent  im- 
perial capital  at  Heijokyo,  or  Nara,  in  A.D.  710.  (Previously  the 
capital  had  been  about  twenty-five  kilometers  south  of  Nara,  in 
and  around  Asuka,  the  name  given  by  some  historians  to  the  pre- 
Nara  period  [538-710]  and  art  style.)  The  capital  at  Nara,  which 
gave  its  name  to  the  new  period  (710-94),  was  styled  after  the  grand 
Chinese  Tang  Dynasty  (618-907)  capital  at  Chang' an  and  was  the 
first  truly  urban  center  in  Japan.  It  soon  had  a  population  of 
200,000,  representing  nearly  4  percent  of  the  country's  popula- 
tion, and  some  10,000  people  worked  in  government  jobs. 

Economic  and  administrative  activity  increased  during  the  Nara 
period.  Roads  linked  Nara  to  provincial  capitals  and  taxes  were 
collected  more  efficiendy  and  routinely.  Coins  were  minted,  if  not 
widely  used.  Outside  the  Nara  area,  however,  there  was  little  com- 
mercial activity,  and  in  the  provinces  the  old  Shotoku  land  reform 
systems  declined.  By  the  mid-eighth  century,  shoen  (landed  es- 
tates), one  of  the  most  important  economic  institutions  in  medieval 
Japan,  began  to  rise  as  a  result  of  the  search  for  a  more  manag- 
able  form  of  landholding.  Local  administration  gradually  became 
more  self-sufficient  while  the  breakdown  of  the  old  land  distri- 
bution system  and  the  rise  of  taxes  led  to  the  loss  or  abandon- 
ment of  land  by  many  people  who  became  the  ''wave  people," 
or  ronin  (see  Glossary).  Some  of  these  formerly  "public  people"  were 


10 


Historical  Setting 


privately  employed  by  large  landholders,  and  "public  lands"  in- 
creasingly reverted  to  the  shoen. 

Factional  fighting  at  the  imperial  court  continued  throughout 
the  Nara  period.  Imperial  family  members,  leading  court  fami- 
lies, such  as  the  Fujiwara,  and  Buddhist  priests  all  contended  for 
influence.  In  the  late  Nara  period,  financial  burdens  on  the  state 
increased,  and  the  court  began  dismissing  nonessential  officials. 
In  792  universal  conscription  was  abandoned,  and  district  heads 
were  allowed  to  establish  private  militia  forces  for  local  police  work. 
Decentralization  of  authority  became  the  rule  despite  the  reforms 
of  the  Nara  period.  Eventually,  to  return  control  to  imperial  hands, 
the  capital  was  moved  in  784  to  Nagaoka  and  in  794  to  Heiankyo 
(Capital  of  Peace  and  Tranquility)  or  Heian,  about  twenty- six 
kilometers  north  of  Nara.  By  the  late  eleventh  century,  the  city 
was  popularly  called  Kyoto  (Capital  City),  the  name  it  has  had 
ever  since. 

Cultural  Developments  and  the  Establishment  of  Buddhism 

Some  of  Japan's  literary  monuments  were  written  during  the 
Nara  period  including  the  Kojiki  and  Nihongi,  the  first  national  his- 
tories compiled  in  712  and  720  respectively;  the  Man'yoshu  (Col- 
lection of  Ten  Thousand  Leaves),  an  anthology  of  poems;  and  the 
Kaifuso  (Fond  Recollections  of  Poetry),  an  anthology  written  in 
Chinese  by  Japanese  emperors  and  princes.  Another  major  cul- 
tural development  of  the  era  was  the  permanent  establishment  of 
Buddhism  in  Japan.  Buddhism  had  been  introduced  in  the  sixth 
century,  but  had  a  mixed  reception  until  the  Nara  period,  when 
it  was  heartily  embraced  by  the  Emperor  Shomu.  Shomu  and  his 
Fujiwara  consort  were  fervent  Buddhists  and  actively  promoted  the 
spread  of  Buddhism,  making  it  the  "guardian  of  the  state"  and 
strengthening  Japanese  institutions  through  still  further  Chinese 
acculturation.  During  Shomu 's  reign,  the  Todaiji  (Great  East  Tem- 
ple) was  built  and  within  it  was  placed  the  Buddha  Dainichi  (Great 
Sun  Buddha),  a  sixteen-meter-high,  gilt-bronze  statue.  This  Buddha 
was  identified  with  the  Sun  Goddess,  and  from  this  point  on  a 
gradual  syncretism  of  Buddism  and  Shinto  ensued.  Shomu  declared 
himself  the  "Servant  of  the  Three  Treasures"  of  Buddhism:  the 
Buddha,  the  law  or  teachings  of  Buddhism,  and  the  Buddhist  com- 
munity. 

Although  these  efforts  stopped  short  of  making  Buddhism  the 
state  religion,  Nara  Buddhism  heightened  the  status  of  the  imperial 
family.  Buddhist  influence  at  court  increased  under  the  two  reigns 
of  Shomu 's  daughter.  As  Empress  Koken  from  749  to  758,  she 
brought  many  Buddhist  priests  into  court.  Koken  abdicated  in  758 


11

on  the  advice  of  her  cousin,  Fujiwara  Nakamaro.  When  the  re- 
tired empress  came  to  favor  a  Buddhist  faith  healer  named  Dokyo, 
Nakamaro  rose  up  in  arms  in  764  but  was  quickly  crushed.  Koken 
charged  the  ruling  emperor  with  colluding  with  Nakamaro,  and 
had  him  deposed  and  reascended  the  throne  as  Empress  Shotoku 
from  764  to  770.  It  was  at  this  point  that  she  commissioned  the 
printing  of  1  million  prayer  charms,  many  examples  of  which  sur- 
vive, and  which  were  known  as  the  earliest  printing  in  the  world 
until  an  earlier  example  dating  751  was  discovered  in  Korea  in  1966. 
Shotoku  had  the  charms  printed  to  placate  the  Buddhist  clergy. 
She  may  even  have  wanted  to  make  Dokyo  emperor,  but  she  died 
before  she  could  act.  Her  actions  shocked  Nara  society  and  led  to 
the  exclusion  of  women  from  imperial  succession  and  the  removal 
of  Buddhist  priests  from  positions  of  political  authority. 

Despite  such  machinations,  Buddhism  began  to  spread  through- 
out Japan  during  the  ensuing  Heian  period  (794-1 185)  primarily 
through  two  major  esoteric  sects,  Tendai  (Heavenly  Terrace)  and 
Shingon  (True  Word).  Tendai  originated  in  China  and  is  based 
on  the  Lotus  Sutra.  Shingon  is  an  indigenous  sect  with  close  affilia- 
tions to  original  Indian,  Tibetan,  and  Chinese  Buddhist  thought 
founded  by  Kukai  (also  called  Kobo  Daishi),  who  gready  impressed 
the  emperors  following  Emperor  Kammu  (782-806)  and  genera- 
tions of  Japanese,  not  only  with  his  holiness,  but  also  with  his  poetry, 
calligraphy,  painting,  and  sculpture.  Kammu  himself  was  a  nota- 
ble patron  of  the  otherworldly  Tendai  sect,  which  rose  to  great 
power  over  the  ensuing  centuries.  A  close  relationship  developed 
between  the  Tendai  monastery  complex  on  Mount  Hiei  and  the 
imperial  court  in  its  new  capital  at  the  foot  of  the  mountain  and, 
as  a  result,  Tendai  emphasized  great  reverence  for  the  emperor 
and  the  nation. 

The  Fujiwara  Regency 

When  Kammu  moved  the  capital  to  Heian  (Kyoto),  which  re- 
mained the  imperial  capital  for  the  next  1 ,000  years,  he  did  so  not 
only  to  strengthen  imperial  authority  but  also  to  improve  his  seat 
of  government  geopolitically.  Kyoto  had  good  river  access  to  the 
sea  and  could  be  reached  by  land  routes  from  the  eastern  provinces. 
The  early  Heian  period  (794-967)  continued  Nara  culture;  the 
Heian  capital  was  patterned  on  the  Chinese  capital  at  Chang' an, 
as  was  Nara,  but  on  a  larger  scale.  Despite  the  decline  of  the  Taika- 
Taiho  reforms,  imperial  government  was  vigorous  during  the  early 
Heian  period.  Indeed,  Kammu 's  avoidance  of  drastic  reform 
decreased  the  intensity  of  political  struggles,  and  he  became  recog- 
nized as  one  of  Japan's  most  forceful  emperors.

Although  Kammu  had  abandoned  universal  conscription  in  792, 
he  still  waged  major  military  offensives  to  subjugate  the  Ainu,  a 
north  Asian  caucasoid  people,  sometimes  referred  to  as  Emishi, 
living  in  northern  and  eastern  Japan.  After  making  temporary  gains 
in  794,  in  797  Kammu  appointed  a  new  commander  under  the 
title  seii  taishogun  (barbarian- subduing  generalissimo,  often  referred 
to  as  shogun).  By  801  the  shogun  had  defeated  the  Ainu  and  ex- 
tended the  imperial  domains  to  the  eastern  end  of  Honshu.  Im- 
perial control  over  the  provinces  was  tenuous  at  best,  however,  and 
in  the  ninth  and  tenth  centuries  much  authority  was  lost  to  the  great 
families  who  disregarded  the  Chinese-style  land  and  tax  systems 
imposed  by  the  government  in  Kyoto.  Stability  came  to  Heian 
Japan,  but,  even  though  succession  was  ensured  for  the  imperial 
family  through  heredity,  power  again  concentrated  in  the  hands 
of  one  noble  family,  the  Fujiwara. 

Following  Kammu 's  death  in  806  and  a  succession  struggle 
among  his  sons,  two  new  offices  were  established  in  an  effort  to 
adjust  the  Taika-Taiho  administrative  structure.  Through  the  new 
Emperor's  Private  Office,  the  emperor  could  issue  administrative 
edicts  more  directly  and  with  more  self-assurance  than  before.  The 
new  Metropolitan  Police  Board  replaced  the  largely  ceremonial 
imperial  guard  units.  While  these  two  offices  strengthened  the 


13

emperor's  position  temporarily,  soon  they  and  other  Chinese-style 
structures  were  bypassed  in  the  developing  state.  Chinese  influence 
effectively  ended  with  the  last  imperial- sanctioned  mission  to  China 
in  838.  Tang  China  was  in  a  state  of  decline,  and  Chinese  Bud- 
dhists were  severely  persecuted,  undermining  Japanese  respect  for 
Chinese  institutions.  Japan  began  to  turn  inward. 

As  the  Soga  had  taken  control  of  the  throne  in  the  sixth  cen- 
tury, the  Fujiwara  by  the  ninth  century  had  intermarried  with  the 
imperial  family,  and  one  of  their  members  was  the  first  head  of 
the  Emperor's  Private  Office.  Another  Fujiwara  became  regent  for 
his  grandson,  then  a  minor  emperor,  and  yet  another  was  appointed 
kanpaku  (regent  for  an  adult  emperor).  Toward  the  end  of  the  ninth 
century,  several  emperors  tried,  but  failed,  to  check  the  Fujiwara. 
For  a  time,  however,  during  the  reign  of  Emperor  Daigo  (897-930), 
the  Fujiwara  regency  was  suspended  as  he  ruled  directly. 

Nevertheless,  the  Fujiwara  were  not  demoted  by  Daigo,  but  ac- 
tually became  stronger  during  his  reign.  Central  control  of  Japan 
had  continued  to  decline,  and  the  Fujiwara,  along  with  other  great 
families  and  religious  foundations,  acquired  ever  larger  shoen  and 
greater  wealth  during  the  early  tenth  century.  By  the  early  Heian 
period,  the  shoen  had  obtained  legal  status,  and  the  large  religious 
establishments  sought  clear  titles  in  perpetuity,  waiver  of  taxes, 
and  immunity  from  government  inspection  of  the  shoen  they  held. 
Those  people  who  worked  the  land  found  it  advantageous  to  transfer 
title  to  shoen  holders  in  return  for  a  share  of  the  harvest.  People 
and  lands  were  increasingly  beyond  central  control  and  taxation, 
a  de  facto  return  to  conditions  before  the  Taika  Reform. 

Within  decades  of  Daigo' s  death,  the  Fujiwara  had  absolute  con- 
trol over  the  court.  By  the  year  1000  Fujiwara  Michinaga  was  able 
to  enthrone  and  dethrone  emperors  at  will.  Little  authority  was 
left  for  traditional  officialdom,  and  government  affairs  were  han- 
dled through  the  Fujiwara  family's  private  administration.  The 
Fujiwara  had  become  what  historian  George  B.  Sansom  has  called 
"hereditary  dictators." 

Despite  their  usurpation  of  imperial  authority,  the  Fujiwara 
presided  over  a  period  of  cultural  and  artistic  flowering  at  the  im- 
perial court  and  among  the  aristocracy.  There  was  great  interest 
in  graceful  poetry  and  vernacular  literature.  Japanese  writing  had 
long  depended  on  Chinese  ideograms  (kanji),  but  these  were  now 
supplemented  by  kana,  a  phonetic  Japanese  script  based  on  sim- 
plified Chinese  ideograms;  katakana,  a  mnemonic  device  using  parts 
of  Chinese  ideograms;  and  hiragana,  a  cursive  form  of  katakana  writ- 
ing and  an  art  form  in  itself  (see  Arts,  ch.  3).  Hiragana  gave  writ- 
ten expression  to  the  spoken  word  and,  with  it,  to  the  rise  in  Japan's 


14

famous  vernacular  literature,  much  of  it  written  by  court  women 
who  had  not  been  trained  in  Chinese  as  had  their  male  counter- 
parts. Three  late  tenth-century  and  early  eleventh-century  women 
presented  their  views  of  life  and  romance  at  the  Heian  court  in 
Kagero  nikki  (The  Gossamer  Years)  by  "the  mother  of  Michitsuna, " 
Makura  no  soshi  (The  Pillow  Book)  by  Sei  Shonagon,  and  Genji  mono- 
gatari  (Tale  of  Genji) — the  world's  first  novel — by  Murasaki  Shikibu 
(see  Literature,  ch.  3).  Indigenous  art  also  flourished  under  the 
Fujiwara  after  centuries  of  imitating  Chinese  forms.  Vividly  colored 
yamato-e  (Japanese  style)  paintings  of  court  life  and  stories  about 
temples  and  shrines  became  common  in  the  mid-  and  late  Heian 
periods,  setting  patterns  for  Japanese  art  to  this  day  (see  Art,  ch.  3). 

As  culture  flourished,  so  did  decentralization.  Whereas  the  first 
phase  of  shorn  development  in  the  early  Heian  period  had  seen  the 
opening  of  new  lands  and  the  commending  of  lands  to  aristocrats 
and  religious  institutions,  during  the  second  phase  patrimonial 
"house  governments,"  as  in  the  old  clan  system,  arose.  (In  fact, 
the  form  of  the  old  clan  system  had  remained  largely  intact  within 
the  great  old  centralized  government.)  New  institutions  were  now 
needed  in  the  face  of  social,  economic,  and  political  changes.  The 
Taiho  Code  lapsed,  its  institutions  relegated  to  ceremonial  func- 
tions. Family  administrations  now  became  public  institutions.  As 
the  most  powerful  family,  the  Fujiwara  governed  Japan  and  de- 
termined the  general  affairs  of  state,  such  as  succession  to  the  throne. 
Family  and  state  affairs  were  thoroughly  intermixed,  a  pattern  fol- 
lowed among  other  families,  monasteries,  and  even  the  imperial 
family.  Land  management  became  the  primary  occupation  of  the 
aristocracy,  not  so  much  because  direct  control  by  the  imperial  fam- 
ily or  central  government  had  declined  but  more  from  strong  fam- 
ily solidarity  and  a  lack  of  a  sense  of  Japan  as  a  single  nation. 

The  Rise  of  the  Military  Class 

Under  the  early  courts,  when  military  conscription  had  been  cen- 
trally controlled,  military  affairs  had  been  taken  out  of  the  hands 
of  the  provincial  aristocracy.  But  as  the  system  broke  down  after 
792,  local  power  holders  again  became  the  primary  source  of  mili- 
tary strength.  Shoen  holders  had  access  to  manpower  and,  as  they 
obtained  improved  military  technology  (such  as  new  training 
methods,  more  powerful  bows,  armor,  horses,  and  superior  swords) 
and  faced  worsening  local  conditions  in  the  ninth  century,  mili- 
tary service  became  part  of  shoen  life.  Not  only  the  shoen,  but  also 
civil  and  religious  institutions  formed  private  guard  units  to  pro- 
tect themselves.  Gradually,  the  provincial  upper  class  was  trans- 
formed into  a  new  military  elite  based  on  the  ideals  of  the  bushi 


15

(warrior)  or  samurai  (literally,  "one  who  serves";  see  The  Bushido 
Code,  ch.  8). 

Bushi  interests  were  diverse,  cutting  across  old  power  structures 
to  form  new  associations  in  the  tenth  century.  Mutual  interests, 
family  connections,  and  kinship  were  consolidated  in  military  groups 
that  became  part  of  family  administration.  In  time,  large  regional 
military  families  formed  around  members  of  the  court  aristocracy 
who  had  become  prominent  provincial  figures.  These  military 
families  gained  prestige  from  connections  to  the  imperial  court  and 
court-granted  military  tides  and  access  to  manpower.  The  Fujiwara, 
Taira,  and  Minamoto  were  among  the  most  prominent  families 
supported  by  the  new  military  class. 

Decline  in  food  production,  growth  of  the  population,  and  com- 
petition for  resources  among  the  great  families  all  led  to  the  gradual 
decline  of  Fujiwara  power  and  gave  rise  to  military  disturbances 
in  the  mid-tenth  and  eleventh  centuries.  Members  of  the  Fujiwara, 
Taira,  and  Minamoto  families — all  of  whom  had  descended  from 
the  imperial  family — attacked  one  another,  claimed  control  over 
vast  tracts  of  conquered  land,  set  up  rival  regimes,  and  generally 
broke  the  peace  of  the  Land  of  the  Rising  Sun. 

The  Fujiwara  controlled  the  throne  until  the  reign  of  Emperor 
Go-Sanjo  (1068-73),  the  first  emperor  not  born  of  a  Fujiwara 
mother  since  the  ninth  century.  Go-Sanjo,  determined  to  restore 
imperial  control  through  strong  personal  rule,  implemented  reforms 
to  curb  Fujiwara  influence.  He  also  established  an  office  to  com- 
pile and  validate  estate  records  with  the  aim  of  reasserting  central 
control.  Many  shoen  were  not  properly  certified,  and  large  land- 
holders, like  the  Fujiwara,  felt  threatened  with  the  loss  of  their  lands. 
Go-Sanjo  also  established  the  Incho,  or  Office  of  the  Cloistered 
Emperor,  which  was  held  by  a  succession  of  emperors  who  abdi- 
cated to  devote  themselves  to  behind-the-scenes  governance,  or  inset 
(cloistered  government). 

The  Incho  filled  the  void  left  by  the  decline  of  Fujiwara  power. 
Rather  than  being  banished,  the  Fujiwara  were  mostly  retained 
in  their  old  positions  of  civil  dictator  and  minister  of  the  center 
while  being  bypassed  in  decision  making.  In  time,  many  of  the 
Fujiwara  were  replaced,  mosdy  by  members  of  the  rising  Minamoto 
family.  While  the  Fujiwara  fell  into  disputes  among  themselves  and 
formed  northern  and  southern  factions,  the  inset  system  allowed 
the  paternal  line  of  the  imperial  family  to  gain  influence  over  the 
throne.  The  period  from  1086  to  1156  was  the  age  of  supremacy 
of  the  Incho  and  of  the  rise  of  the  military  class  throughout  the 
country.  Military  might  rather  than  civil  authority  dominated  the 
government.

Historical  Setting 


A  struggle  for  succession  in  the  mid-twelfth  century  gave  the 
Fujiwara  an  opportunity  to  regain  their  former  power.  Fujiwara 
Yorinaga  sided  with  the  retired  emperor  in  a  violent  battle  in  1 158 
against  the  heir  apparent,  who  was  supported  by  the  Taira  and 
Minamoto.  In  the  end,  the  Fujiwara  were  destroyed,  the  old  sys- 
tem of  government  supplanted,  and  the  inset  system  left  powerless 
as  bushi  took  control  of  court  affairs,  marking  a  turning  point  in 
Japanese  history.  Within  a  year,  the  Taira  and  Minamoto  clashed 
and  a  twenty-year  period  of  Taira  ascendancy  began.  The  Taira 
were  seduced  by  court  life  and  ignored  problems  in  the  provinces. 
Finally,  Minamoto  Yoritomo  (1147-99)  rose  from  his  headquar- 
ters at  Kamakura  (in  the  Kanto  region,  southwest  of  modern  Tokyo) 
to  defeat  the  Taira,  and  with  them  the  child  emperor  they  con- 
trolled, in  the  Genpei  War  (1180-85). 

Kamakura  and  Muromachi  Periods,  1185-1573 
The  Bakufu  and  the  Hojo  Regency 

The  Kamakura  period  (1185-1333)  marks  the  transition  to  the 
Japanese  "medieval"  era,  a  nearly  700-year  period  in  which  the 
emperor,  the  court,  and  the  traditional  central  government  were 
left  intact,  but  were  largely  relegated  to  ceremonial  functions.  Civil, 
military,  and  judicial  matters  were  controlled  by  the  bushi  class, 
the  most  powerful  of  whom  was  the  de  facto  national  ruler.  The 
term  feudalism  is  generally  used  to  describe  this  period,  being  ac- 
cepted by  scholars  as  applicable  to  medieval  Japan  as  well  as 
medieval  Europe.  Both  had  land-based  economies,  vestiges  of  a 
previously  centralized  state,  and  a  concentration  of  advanced  mili- 
tary technologies  in  the  hands  of  a  specialized  fighting  class.  Lords 
required  the  loyal  services  of  vassals,  who  were  rewarded  with  fiefs 
of  their  own.  The  fief  holders  exercised  local  military  rule  and  public 
power  related  to  the  holding  of  land.  This  period  in  Japan  differed 
from  the  old  shoen  system  in  its  pervasive  military  emphasis. 

Once  Minamoto  Yoritomo  had  consolidated  his  power,  he  es- 
tablished a  new  government  at  his  family  home  in  Kamakura.  He 
called  his  government  a  bakufu  (tent  government),  but  because  he 
was  given  the  title  sett  taishogun  by  the  emperor,  it  is  often  referred 
to  in  Western  literature  as  the  shogunate.  Yoritomo  followed  the 
Fujiwara  form  of  house  government  and  had  an  administrative 
board,  a  board  of  retainers,  and  a  board  of  inquiry.  After  confis- 
cating Taira  estates  in  central  and  western  Japan,  he  had  the  im- 
perial court  appoint  stewards  for  the  estates  and  constables  for  the 
provinces.  As  shogun,  Yoritomo  was  both  the  steward  and  the 
constable- general.  The  Kamakura  bakufu  was  not  a  national  regime, 


17 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


however,  and  although  it  controlled  large  tracts  of  land,  there  was 
strong  resistance  to  the  stewards.  The  regime  continued  warfare 
against  the  Fujiwara  in  the  north,  but  never  brought  either  the  north 
or  the  west  under  complete  military  control.  The  old  court  resided 
in  Kyoto,  continuing  to  hold  the  land  over  which  it  had  jurisdic- 
tion, while  newly  organized  military  families  were  attracted  to 
Kamakura. 

Despite  a  strong  beginning,  Yoritomo  failed  to  consolidate  the 
leadership  of  his  family  on  a  lasting  basis.  Intrafamily  contention 
had  long  existed  within  the  Minamoto,  although  Yoritomo  had 
eliminated  most  serious  challengers  to  his  authority.  When  he  died 
suddenly  in  1 199,  his  son  Yoriie  became  shogun  and  nominal  head 
of  the  Minamoto,  but  Yoriie  was  unable  to  control  the  other  eastern 
bushi  families.  By  the  early  thirteenth  century,  a  regency  had  been 
established  for  the  shogun  by  his  maternal  grandparents — members 
of  the  Hqjo  family,  a  branch  of  the  Taira  that  had  allied  itself  with 
the  Minamoto  in  1 180.  Under  the  Hqjo,  the  bakufu  became  power- 
less, and  the  shogun,  often  a  member  of  the  Fujiwara  family  or 
even  an  imperial  prince,  was  merely  a  figurehead. 

With  the  protector  of  the  emperor  a  figurehead  himself,  strains 
emerged  between  Kyoto  and  Kamakura,  and  in  1221  a  war — the 
Jokyu  Incident — broke  out  between  the  cloistered  emperor  and  the 
Hqjo  regent.  The  Hqjo  forces  easily  won  the  war,  and  the  imperial 
court  was  brought  under  direct  bakufu  control.  The  shogun 's  con- 
stables gained  greater  civil  powers,  and  the  court  was  obliged  to 
seek  Kamakura 's  approval  for  all  of  its  actions.  Although  deprived 
of  political  power,  the  court  was  allowed  to  retain  extensive  estates 
with  which  to  sustain  the  imperial  splendor  the  bakufu  needed  to 
help  sanction  its  rule. 

Several  significant  administrative  achievements  were  made  dur- 
ing the  Hqjo  regency.  In  1225  the  Council  of  State  was  established, 
providing  opportunities  for  other  military  lords  to  exercise  judi- 
cial and  legislative  authority  at  Kamakura.  The  Hqjo  regent  presid- 
ed over  the  council,  which  was  a  successful  form  of  collective 
leadership.  The  adoption  of  Japan's  first  military  code  of  law — 
the  Joei  Code — in  1232  reflected  the  profound  transition  from  court 
to  militarized  society.  While  legal  practices  in  Kyoto  were  still  based 
on  500-year-old  Confucian  principles,  the  Joei  Code  was  a  highly 
legalistic  document  that  stressed  the  duties  of  stewards  and  con- 
stables, provided  means  for  settling  land  disputes,  and  established 
rules  governing  inheritances.  It  was  clear  and  concise,  stipulated 
punishments  for  violators  of  its  conditions,  and  remained  in  effect 
for  the  next  635  years.

As  might  be  expected,  the  literature  of  the  time  reflected  the  un- 
settled nature  of  the  period.  The  Hojoki  (An  Account  of  My  Hut) 
describes  the  turmoil  of  the  period  in  terms  of  the  Buddhist  con- 
cepts of  impermanance  and  the  vanity  of  human  projects.  The  Heike 
monogatari  (Tale  of  the  Heike)  narrated  the  rise  and  fall  of  the  Taira 
(also  known  as  the  Heike),  replete  with  tales  of  wars  and  samurai 
deeds.  A  second  literary  mainstream  was  the  continuation  of 
anthologies  of  poetry  in  the  Shin  kokinshu  wakashu  (New  Collection 
of  Ancient  and  Modern  Times),  of  which  twenty  volumes  were 
produced  between  1201  and  1205. 

The  Flourishing  of  Buddhism 

In  the  time  of  disunity  and  violence,  deepening  pessimism  in- 
creased the  appeal  of  the  search  for  salvation.  Kamakura  was  the 
age  of  the  great  popularization  of  Buddhism  with  two  new  sects, 
Jodo  (Pure  Land)  and  Zen  (Meditation),  dominating  the  period. 
The  old  Heian  sects  had  been  quite  esoteric  and  more  appealing 
to  intellectuals  than  to  the  masses.  The  Mount  Hiei  monasteries 
had  become  politically  powerful  but  appealed  primarily  to  those 
capable  of  systematic  study  of  the  sect's  teachings.  This  situation 
gave  rise  to  the  Jodo  sect,  based  on  unconditional  faith  and  devotion 


19

and  prayer  to  Amida  Buddha.  Zen  rejected  all  temporal  and  scrip- 
tural authority,  stressing  moral  character  rather  than  intellectual 
attainments,  an  emphasis  that  appealed  to  the  military  class.  Zen 
masters,  regarded  as  embodiments  of  truth,  were  turned  to  by  grow- 
ing numbers  of  the  military  class. 

Mongol  Invasions 

The  repulsions  of  two  Mongol  invasions  were  momentous  events 
in  Japanese  history.  Japanese  relations  with  China  had  been  ter- 
minated in  the  mid-ninth  century  after  the  deterioration  of  late  Tang 
China  and  the  turning  inward  of  the  Heian  court.  Some  commer- 
cial contacts  were  maintained  with  southern  China  in  later  centu- 
ries, but  Japanese  pirates  made  the  open  seas  dangerous.  At  a  time 
when  the  bakufu  had  little  interest  in  foreign  affairs  and  ignored 
communications  from  China  and  Koryo  (as  Korea  was  then  known), 
news  arrived  in  1268  of  a  new  Mongol  regime  in  Beijing.  Its  leader, 
Khubilai  Khan,  demanded  that  the  Japanese  pay  tribute  to  the  new 
Yuan  Dynasty  (1279-1368)  and  threatened  reprisals  if  they  failed 
to  do  so.  Unused  to  such  threats,  Kyoto  raised  the  diplomatic  coun- 
ter of  Japan's  divine  origin,  rejected  the  Mongol  demands,  dis- 
missed the  Korean  messengers,  and  started  defensive  preparations. 
After  further  unsuccessful  entreaties,  the  first  Mongol  invasion  took 
place  in  1274.  More  than  600  ships  carried  a  combined  Mongol, 
Chinese,  and  Korean  force  of  23,000  troops  armed  with  catapults, 
combustible  missiles,  and  bows  and  arrows.  In  fighting,  these  sol- 
diers grouped  in  close  cavalry  formations  against  samurai  ac- 
customed to  one-on-one  combat.  Local  Japanese  forces  at  Hakata, 
on  northern  Kyushu,  defended  against  the  superior  mainland  force, 
which,  after  one  day  of  fighting  was  decimated  by  the  onslaught 
of  a  sudden  typhoon.  Khubilai  realized  that  nature,  not  military 
incompetence,  had  been  the  cause  of  his  forces'  failure  so,  in  1281, 
he  launched  a  second  invasion.  Seven  weeks  of  fighting  took  place 
in  northwestern  Kyushu  before  another  typhoon  struck,  again  de- 
stroying the  Mongol  fleet. 

Although  Shinto  priests  attributed  the  two  defeats  of  the  Mon- 
gols to  a  "divine  wind"  (kamikaze),  a  sign  of  heaven's  special  pro- 
tection of  Japan,  the  invasion  left  a  deep  impression  on  the  bakufu 
leaders.  Long-standing  fears  of  the  Chinese  threat  to  Japan  were 
reinforced,  and  the  Korean  Peninsula  became  regarded  as  "an 
arrow  pointed  at  the  heart  of  Japan."  The  Japanese  victory,  how- 
ever, gave  the  bushi  a  sense  of  fighting  superiority  that  remained 
with  Japan's  soldiers  until  1945.  The  victory  also  convinced  the 
bushi  of  the  value  of  the  bakufu  form  of  government.

Historical  Setting 


The  Mongol  war  had  been  a  drain  on  the  economy,  and  new 
taxes  had  to  be  levied  to  maintain  defensive  preparations  for  the 
future.  The  invasions  also  caused  disaffection  among  those  who 
expected  recompense  for  their  help  in  defeating  the  Mongols.  There 
were  no  lands  or  other  rewards  to  be  given,  however,  and  such 
disaffection,  combined  with  overextension  and  the  increasing 
defense  costs,  led  to  a  decline  of  the  Kamakura  bakufu.  Addition- 
ally, inheritances  had  divided  family  properties,  and  landowners 
increasingly  had  to  turn  to  moneylenders  for  support.  Roving  bands 
of  ronin  further  threatened  the  stability  of  the  bakufu. 

Civil  War 

The  Hojo  reacted  to  the  ensuing  chaos  by  trying  to  place  more 
power  among  the  various  great  family  clans.  To  further  weaken 
the  Kyoto  court,  the  bakufu  decided  to  allow  two  contending  im- 
perial lines — known  as  the  Southern  Court  or  junior  line  and  the 
Northern  Court  or  senior  line — to  alternate  on  the  throne.  The 
method  worked  for  several  successions  until  a  member  of  the 
Southern  Court  ascended  to  the  throne  as  Emperor  Go-Daigo 
(1318-39).  Go-Daigo  wanted  to  overthrow  the  bakufu  and  openly 
defied  Kamakura  by  naming  his  own  son  his  heir.  In  1331  the  bakufu 
exiled  Go-Daigo,  but  loyalist  forces  rebelled.  They  were  aided  by 
Ashikaga  Takauji  (1305-58),  a  constable  who  turned  against 
Kamakura  when  dispatched  to  put  down  Go-Daigo 's  rebellion.  At 
the  same  time,  another  eastern  chieftain  rebelled  against  the  bakufu, 
which  quickly  disintegrated,  and  the  Hojo  were  defeated. 

In  the  swell  of  victory,  Go-Daigo  endeavored  to  restore  imperial 
authority  and  tenth-century  Confucian  practices.  This  period  of 
reform,  known  as  the  Kemmu  Restoration  (1333-36),  aimed  at 
strengthening  the  position  of  the  emperor  and  reasserting  the  pri- 
macy of  the  court  nobles  over  the  bushi.  The  reality,  however,  was 
that  the  forces  who  had  arisen  against  Kamakura  had  been  set  on 
defeating  the  Hojo,  not  on  supporting  the  emperor.  Ashikaga 
Takauji  finally  sided  with  the  Northern  Court  in  a  civil  war  against 
the  Southern  Court  represented  by  Go-Daigo.  The  long  War  Be- 
tween the  Courts  lasted  from  1336  to  1392.  Early  in  the  conflict, 
Go-Daigo  was  driven  from  Kyoto,  and  the  Northern  Court  con- 
tender was  installed  by  Ashikaga,  who  became  the  new  shogun. 

Ashikaga  Bakufu 

The  ensuing  period  of  Ashikaga  rule  (1336-1573)  was  called 
Muromachi  for  the  district  in  which  its  headquarters  were  in  Kyoto 
after  1378.  What  distinguished  the  Ashikaga  bakufu  from  that  of 
Kamakura  was  that,  whereas  Kamakura  had  existed  in  equilibrium 


21 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

with  the  Kyoto  court,  Ashikaga  took  over  the  remnants  of  the  im- 
perial government.  Nevertheless,  the  Ashikaga  bakufu  was  not  as 
strong  as  the  Kamakura  had  been  and  was  greatly  preoccupied  by 
the  civil  war.  Not  until  the  rule  of  Ashikaga  Yoshimitsu  (as  third 
shogun,  1368-94,  and  chancellor,  1394-1408)  did  a  semblance  of 
order  emerge. 

Yoshimitsu  allowed  the  constables,  who  had  had  limited  pow- 
ers during  the  Kamakura  period,  to  become  strong  regional  rul- 
ers, later  called  daimyo  (from  dai,  great,  and  mydden,  named  lands). 
In  time  a  balance  of  power  evolved  between  the  shogun  and  the 
daimyo;  the  three  most  prominent  daimyo  families  rotated  as  deputies 
to  the  shogun  at  Kyoto.  Yoshimitsu  was  finally  successful  in  re- 
unifying the  Northern  and  Southern  courts  in  1392,  but,  despite 
his  promise  of  greater  balance  between  the  imperial  lines,  the  North- 
ern line  maintained  control  over  the  throne  thereafter.  The  line 
of  shoguns  gradually  weakened  after  Yoshimitsu  and  increasingly 
lost  power  to  the  daimyo  and  other  regional  strongmen.  The  sho- 
gun's  decisions  about  imperial  succession  became  meaningless,  and 
the  daimyo  backed  their  own  candidates.  In  time,  the  Ashikaga  fam- 
ily had  its  own  succession  problems,  resulting  finally  in  the  Onin 
War  (1467-77),  which  left  Kyoto  devastated  and  effectively  ended 
the  national  authority  of  the  bakufu.  The  power  vacuum  that  en- 
sued launched  a  century  of  anarchy  (see  Provincial  Wars  and  For- 
eign Contacts,  this  ch.). 

Economic  and  Cultural  Developments 

Contact  with  Ming  Dynasty  (1368-1644)  China  was  renewed 
during  the  Muromachi  period  after  the  Chinese  sought  support 
in  suppressing  Japanese  pirates,  or  wako,  who  controlled  the  seas 
and  pillaged  coastal  areas  of  China.  Wanting  to  improve  relations 
with  China  and  to  rid  Japan  of  the  wako  threat,  Yoshimitsu  ac- 
cepted a  relationship  with  the  Chinese  that  was  to  last  for  half  a 
century.  Japanese  wood,  sulfur,  copper  ore,  swords,  and  folding 
fans  were  traded  for  Chinese  silk,  porcelain,  books,  and  coins  in 
what  the  Chinese  considered  tribute  but  the  Japanese  saw  as  profit- 
able trade. 

During  the  time  of  the  Ashikaga  bakufu,  a  new  national  culture, 
called  Muromachi  culture,  emerged  from  the  bakufu  headquarters 
in  Kyoto  to  reach  all  levels  of  society.  Zen  Buddhism  played  a  large 
role  in  spreading  not  only  religious  but  also  artistic  influences,  es- 
pecially those  derived  from  Chinese  painting  of  the  Chinese  Song 
(960-1279),  Yuan,  and  Ming  dynasties.  The  proximity  of  the  im- 
perial court  and  the  bakufu  resulted  in  a  comingling  of  imperial  fam- 
ily members,  courtiers,  daimyo,  samurai,  and  Zen  priests.  Art  of

all  kinds,  architecture,  literature,  No  drama,  comedy,  poetry,  the 
tea  ceremony,  landscape  gardening,  and  flower  arranging,  all 
flourished  during  Muromachi  times. 

There  also  was  renewed  interest  in  Shinto,  which  had  quietly 
coexisted  with  Buddhism  during  the  centuries  of  the  latter' s 
predominance.  In  fact,  Shinto,  which  lacked  its  own  scriptures  and 
had  few  prayers,  as  a  result  of  syncretic  practices  begun  in  the  Nara 
period  had  widely  adopted  Shingon  Buddhist  rituals  and,  between 
the  eighth  and  fourteenth  centuries,  was  nearly  totally  absorbed 
by  Buddhism  and  became  known  as  Ryobu  Shinto  (Dual  Shinto) . 
The  Mongol  invasions  in  the  late  thirteenth  century,  however,  had 
evoked  a  national  consciousness  of  the  role  of  the  kamikaze  in  defeat- 
ing the  enemy.  Less  than  fifty  years  later  (1339-43),  Kitabatake 
Chikafusa  (1293-1354),  the  chief  commander  of  the  Southern  Court 
forces,  wrote  the  Jinno  shoto  ki  (Chronicle  of  the  Direct  Descent  of 
the  Divine  Sovereigns).  This  chronicle  emphasized  the  importance 
of  maintaining  the  divine  descent  of  the  imperial  line  from  Ama- 
terasu  to  the  current  emperor,  a  condition  that  gave  Japan  a  spe- 
cial national  polity  (kokutai).  Besides  reenforcing  the  concept  of  the 
emperor  as  a  deity,  the  Jinno  shoto  ki  provided  a  Shinto  view  of  his- 
tory, which  stressed  the  divine  nature  of  all  Japanese  and  the  coun- 
try's spiritual  supremacy  over  China  and  India.  As  a  result,  a 
change  gradually  occurred  in  the  balance  between  the  dual 
Buddhist- Shinto  religious  practice.  Between  the  fourteenth  and 
seventeenth  centuries,  Shinto  reemerged  as  the  primary  belief  sys- 
tem, developed  its  own  philosophy  and  scripture  (based  on  Con- 
fucian and  Buddhist  canons),  and  became  a  powerful  nationalistic 
force. 

Provincial  Wars  and  Foreign  Contacts 

The  Onin  War  led  to  serious  political  fragmentation  and  obliter- 
ation of  domains:  a  great  struggle  for  land  and  power  ensued  among 
bushi  chieftains  until  the  mid-sixteenth  century.  Peasants  rose  against 
their  landlords  and  samurai  against  their  overlords  as  central  con- 
trol virtually  ceased.  The  imperial  house  was  left  impoverished, 
and  the  bakufu  was  controlled  by  contending  chieftains  in  Kyoto. 
The  provincial  domains  that  emerged  after  the  Onin  War  were 
smaller  and  easier  to  control.  Many  new  small  daimyo  arose  from 
among  the  samurai  who  had  overthrown  their  great  overlords. 
Border  defenses  were  improved  and  well-fortified  castle  towns  began 
to  be  built  to  protect  the  newly  opened  domains,  for  which  land 
surveys  were  made,  roads  built,  and  mines  opened.  New  house 
laws  provided  practical  means  of  administration,  stressing  duties 
and  rules  of  behavior.  Emphasis  was  put  on  success  in  war,  estate 


23

management,  and  finance.  Threatening  alliances  were  guarded 
against  through  strict  marriage  rules.  Aristocratic  society  was  over- 
whelmingly military  in  character,  the  rest  of  society  controlled  in 
a  system  of  vassalage.  The  shoen  were  obliterated,  and  court  no- 
bles and  absentee  landlords  were  dispossessed.  The  new  daimyo 
directly  controlled  the  land,  keeping  the  peasantry  in  permanent 
serfdom  in  exchange  for  protection. 

Most  wars  of  the  period  were  short  and  localized,  though  they 
occurred  throughout  Japan.  By  1500  the  entire  country  was  en- 
gulfed in  civil  wars.  Rather  than  disrupting  the  local  economies, 
however,  the  frequent  movement  of  armies  stimulated  the  growth 
of  transportation  and  communications,  which  in  turn  provided  ad- 
ditional revenues  from  customs  and  tolls.  To  avoid  such  fees,  com- 
merce shifted  to  the  central  region,  which  no  daimyo  had  been  able 
to  control,  and  to  the  Inland  Sea.  Economic  developments  and  the 
desire  to  protect  trade  achievements  brought  about  the  establish- 
ment of  merchant  and  artisan  guilds. 

By  the  end  of  the  Muromachi  period,  the  first  Europeans  had 
arrived.  The  Portuguese  landed  in  southern  Kyoshu  in  1543  and 
within  two  years  were  making  regular  port  calls.  The  Spanish  ar- 
rived in  1587,  followed  by  the  Dutch  in  1609.  The  Japanese  began 
to  attempt  studies  of  European  civilization  in  depth,  and  new  op- 
portunities were  presented  for  the  economy  along  with  serious  po- 
litical challenges.  European  firearms,  fabrics,  glassware,  clocks, 
tobacco,  and  other  Western  innovations  were  traded  for  Japanese 
gold  and  silver.  Wealth  was  accumulated  on  a  major  scale  through 
trade,  and  lesser  daimyo,  especially  in  Kyushu,  greatiy  increased 
their  power.  Provincial  wars  were  made  more  deadly  with  the  in- 
troduction of  firearms,  such  as  muskets  and  cannons,  and  greater 
use  of  infantry. 

Christianity  had  an  impact  on  Japan,  largely  through  the  efforts 
of  the  Jesuits,  led  first  by  Saint  Francis  Xavier  (1506-52),  who  ar- 
rived in  Kagoshima  in  southern  Kyushu  in  1549.  Both  daimyo  and 
merchants  seeking  better  trade  arrangements  as  well  as  peasants 
were  among  the  converts.  By  1560  Kyoto  had  become  another 
major  area  of  missionary  activity  in  Japan.  In  1568  the  port  of 
Nagasaki  was  established  by  a  Christian  daimyo,  and  turned  over 
to  Jesuit  administration  in  1579.  By  1582  there  were  as  many  as 
150,000  converts  (2  percent  of  the  population)  and  200  churches. 
But  bakufu  tolerance  for  this  alien  influence  diminished  as  the  coun- 
try became  more  unified  and  the  openness  of  the  period  decreased. 
Proscriptions  against  Christianity  began  in  1587  and  outright  perse- 
cutions in  1597.  Although  foreign  trade  was  still  encouraged,  it 
was  closely  regulated,  and  by  1640  the  exclusion  and  suppression 


24

of  Christianity  had  become  national  policy  (see  Tokugawa  Period, 
1600-1867,  this  ch.;  Religious  and  Philosophical  Traditions,  ch.  2). 

Reunification,  1573-1600 

Between  1560  and  1600,  powerful  military  leaders  arose  to  defeat 
the  warring  daimyo  and  unify  Japan.  Three  major  figures  dominated 
the  period  in  succession:  Oda  Nobunaga  (1534-82),  Toyotomi 
Hideyoshi  (1536-98),  and  Tokugawa  Ieyasu  (1542-1616),  each  of 
whom  emerged  as  a  major  overlord  with  large  military  forces  under 
his  command.  As  their  power  increased,  they  looked  to  the  im- 
perial court  in  Kyoto  for  sanction.  In  1568  Nobunaga,  who  had 
defeated  another  overlord's  attempt  to  attack  Kyoto  in  1560, 
marched  on  the  capital,  gained  the  support  of  the  emperor,  and 
installed  his  own  candidate  in  the  succession  struggle  for  shogun. 
Backed  by  military  force,  Nobunaga  was  able  to  control  the  bakufu. 

Initial  resistance  to  Nobunaga  in  the  Kyoto  region  came  from 
the  Buddhist  monks,  rival  daimyo,  and  hostile  merchants.  Sur- 
rounded by  his  enemies,  Nobunaga  struck  first  at  the  secular  power 
of  the  militant  Tendai  Buddhists,  destroying  their  monastic  center 
at  Mount  Hiei  near  Kyoto  and  killing  thousands  of  monks  in  1571 . 
By  1573  he  had  defeated  the  local  daimyo,  banished  the  last  Ashikaga 
shogun,  and  ushered  in  what  historians  call  the  Azuchi-Momoyama 
period  (1573-1600),  named  after  the  castles  of  Nobunaga  and 
Hideyoshi.  Having  taken  these  major  steps  toward  reunification, 
Nobunaga  then  built  a  seven- story  castle  surrounded  by  stone  walls 
at  Azuchi  on  the  shore  of  Lake  Biwa.  The  castle  was  able  to  with- 
stand firearms  and  became  a  symbol  of  the  age  of  reunification. 
Nobunaga' s  power  increased  as  he  enfeoffed  the  conquered  daimyo, 
broke  down  the  barriers  to  free  commerce,  and  drew  the  humbled 
religious  communities  and  merchants  into  his  military  structure. 
He  secured  control  of  about  one-third  of  the  provinces  through  the 
use  of  large-scale  warfare  and  he  institutionalized  administrative  prac- 
tices, such  as  systematic  village  organization,  tax  collection,  and  stan- 
dardized measurements.  At  the  same  time,  other  daimyo,  both  those 
Nobunaga  had  conquered  and  those  beyond  his  control,  built  their 
own  heavily  fortified  castles  and  modernized  their  garrisons.  In  1577 
Nobunaga  dispatched  his  chief  general,  Hideyoshi,  to  conquer  twelve 
western  Honshu  provinces.  The  war  was  a  protracted  affair,  and 
in  1582,  when  Nobunaga  led  an  army  to  assist  Hideyoshi,  he  was 
assassinated. 

After  destroying  the  forces  responsible  for  Nobunaga' s  death, 
Hideyoshi  was  rewarded  with  a  joint  guardianship  of  Nobunaga' s 
heir,  who  was  a  minor.  By  1584  Hideyoshi  had  eliminated  the  three 
other  guardians,  taken  complete  control  of  Kyoto,  and  become  the 


25 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


undisputed  successor  of  his  late  overlord.  A  commoner  by  birth 
and  without  a  surname,  Hideyoshi  was  adopted  by  the  Fujiwara 
family,  given  the  surname  Toyotomi,  and  granted  the  tide  kanpaku, 
representing  civil  and  military  control  of  all  Japan.  By  the  follow- 
ing year,  he  had  secured  alliances  with  three  of  the  nine  major  daimyo 
coalitions  and  continued  the  war  of  reunification  in  Shikoku  and 
northern  Kyushu.  In  1590,  with  an  army  of  200,000  troops, 
Hideyoshi  defeated  his  last  formidable  rival,  who  controlled  the 
Kanto  region  of  eastern  Honshu.  The  remaining  contending  daimyo 
capitulated,  and  the  military  reunification  of  Japan  was  complete. 

All  of  Japan  was  controlled  by  the  dictatorial  Hideyoshi  either 
directly  or  through  his  sworn  vassals,  and  a  new  national  govern- 
ment structure  had  evolved:  a  country  unified  under  one  daimyo 
alliance  but  still  decentralized.  The  basis  of  the  power  structure 
was  again  the  distribution  of  territory.  A  new  unit  of  land  mea- 
surement and  assessment — the  koku — was  instituted.  One  koku  was 
equivalent  to  about  180  liters  of  rice;  daimyo  were  by  definition  those 
who  held  lands  capable  of  producing  10,000  koku  or  more  of  rice. 
Hideyoshi  personally  controlled  2  million  of  the  18.5  million  koku 
total  national  assessment  (taken  in  1598).  Tokugawa  Ieyasu,  a  pow- 
erful central  Honshu  daimyo  (not  completely  under  Hideyoshi' s  con- 
trol), held  2.5  million  koku. 

Despite  Hideyoshi 's  tremendous  strength  and  the  fear  in  which 
he  was  held,  his  position  was  far  from  secure.  He  attempted  to  re- 
arrange the  daimyo  holdings  to  his  advantage,  for  example,  reas- 
signing the  Tokugawa  family  to  the  conquered  Kanto  region  and 
surrounding  their  new  territory  with  more  trusted  vassals.  He  also 
adopted  a  hostage  system  for  daimyo  wives  and  heirs  at  his  castle 
town  at  Osaka  and  used  marriage  alliances  to  enforce  feudal  bonds. 
He  imposed  the  koku  system  and  land  surveys  to  reassess  the  en- 
tire nation.  In  1590  Hideyoshi  declared  an  end  to  any  further  class 
mobility  or  change  in  social  status,  reinforcing  the  class  distinc- 
tions between  cultivators  and  bushi  (only  the  latter  could  bear  arms). 
He  provided  for  an  orderly  succession  in  1591  by  taking  the  title 
taiko,  or  retired  kanpaku,  turning  the  regency  over  to  his  son 
Hideyori.  Only  toward  the  end  of  his  life  did  Hideyoshi  try  to  for- 
malize the  balance  of  power  by  establishing  the  five-member  Board 
of  Regents  (one  of  them  Ieyasu),  sworn  to  keep  peace  and  support 
the  Toyotomi,  the  five-member  Board  of  House  Administrators 
for  routine  policy  and  administrative  matters,  and  the  three-member 
Board  of  Mediators,  who  were  charged  with  keeping  peace  between 
the  first  two  boards. 

Momoyama  art  (1573-1615),  named  after  the  hill  on  which 
Hideyoshi  built  his  castle  at  Fushima,  south  of  Kyoto,  flourished

during  this  period.  It  was  a  period  of  interest  in  the  outside  world, 
the  development  of  large  urban  centers,  and  the  rise  of  the  mer- 
chant and  leisure  classes.  Ornate  castle  architecture  and  interiors 
adorned  with  painted  screens  embellished  with  gold  leaf  reflected 
daimyo  power  and  wealth  of  the  period.  Depictions  of  the  "southern 
barbarians" — Europeans — were  exotic  and  popular. 

In  1577  Hideyoshi  had  seized  Nagasaki,  Japan's  major  point 
of  contact  with  the  outside  world.  He  took  control  of  the  various 
trade  associations  and  tried  to  regulate  all  overseas  activities. 
Although  China  rebuffed  his  efforts  to  secure  trade  concessions, 
Hideyoshi  succeeded  in  sending  commercial  missions  to  the  Philip- 
pines, Malaya,  and  Siam  (present-day  Thailand).  He  was  suspi- 
cious of  Christianity,  however,  as  potentially  subversive  to  daimyo 
loyalties  and  he  had  some  missionaries  crucified. 

Hideyoshi' s  major  ambition  was  to  conquer  China,  and  in  1592, 
with  an  army  of  200,000  troops,  he  invaded  Korea,  then  a  Chinese 
vassal  state.  His  armies  quickly  overran  the  peninsula  before  los- 
ing momentum  in  the  face  of  a  combined  Korean-Chinese  force. 
During  peace  talks  Hideyoshi  demanded  a  division  of  Korea,  free- 
trade  status,  and  a  Chinese  princess  as  consort  for  the  emperor. 
The  equality  with  China  sought  by  Japan  was  rebuffed  by  the 
Chinese  and  peace  efforts  ended.  In  1597  a  second  invasion  was 
begun,  but  it  abruptly  ended  with  Hideyoshi 's  death  in  1598. 

Tokugawa  Period,  1600-1867 
Rule  of  Shogun  and  Daimyo 

An  evolution  had  taken  place  in  the  centuries  from  the  time  of 
the  Kamakura  bakufu,  which  existed  in  equilibrium  with  the  im- 
perial court,  to  the  Tokugawa,  when  the  bushi  became  the  un- 
challenged rulers  in  what  historian  Edwin  O.  Reischauer  has  called 
a  ''centralized  feudal"  form  of  government.  Instrumental  in  the 
rise  of  the  new  bakufu  was  Tokugawa  Ieyasu,  the  main  beneficiary 
of  the  achievements  of  Nobunaga  and  Hideyoshi.  Already  power- 
ful, Ieyasu  profited  by  his  transfer  to  the  rich  Kanto  area.  He  main- 
tained 2.5  million  koku  of  land,  had  a  new  headquarters  at  Edo, 
a  strategically  situated  castle  town  (the  future  Tokyo),  and  had  an 
additional  2  million  koku  of  land  and  thirty-eight  vassals  under  his 
control.  After  Hideyoshi 's  death,  Ieyasu  moved  quickly  to  seize 
control  from  the  Toyotomi  family. 

Ieyasu 's  victory  over  the  western  daimyo  at  the  Battle  of  Sekiga- 
hara  (1600)  gave  him  virtual  control  of  all  Japan.  He  rapidly 
abolished  numerous  enemy  daimyo  houses,  reduced  others,  such 
as  that  of  the  Toyotomi,  and  redistributed  the  spoils  of  war  to  his

family  and  allies.  Ieyasu  still  failed  to  achieve  complete  control  of 
the  western  daimyo,  but  his  assumption  of  the  title  of  shogun  helped 
consolidate  the  alliance  system.  After  further  strengthening  his 
power  base,  Ieyasu  was  confident  enough  to  install  his  son  Hidetada 
(1579-1632)  as  shogun  and  himself  as  retired  shogun  in  1605.  The 
Toyotomi  were  still  a  significant  threat,  and  Ieyasu  devoted  the 
next  decade  to  their  eradication.  In  1615  the  Toyotomi  stronghold 
at  Osaka  was  destroyed  by  the  Tokugawa  army. 

The  Tokugawa  (or  Edo)  period  brought  200  years  of  stability 
to  Japan.  The  political  system  evolved  into  what  historians  call 
bakuhan,  a  combination  of  the  terms  bakufu  and  han  (domains)  to 
describe  the  government  and  society  of  the  period.  In  the  bakuhan, 
the  shogun  had  national  authority  and  the  daimyo  had  regional 
authority,  a  new  unity  in  the  feudal  structure,  which  had  an  in- 
creasingly large  bureaucracy  to  administer  the  mixture  of  central- 
ized and  decentralized  authorities.  The  Tokugawa  became  more 
powerful  during  their  first  century  of  rule:  land  redistribution  gave 
them  nearly  7  million  koku,  control  of  the  most  important  cities, 
and  a  land  assessment  system  reaping  great  revenues. 

The  feudal  hierarchy  was  completed  by  the  various  classes  of 
daimyo.  Closest  to  the  Tokugawa  house  were  the  shinpan  or  "re- 
lated houses."  They  were  twenty-three  daimyo  on  the  borders  of 
Tokugawa  lands,  daimyo  all  direcdy  related  to  Ieyasu.  The  shinpan 
held  mostly  honorary  titles  and  advisory  posts  in  the  bakufu.  The 
second  class  of  the  hierarchy  were  the  fudai,  or  "house  daimyo" 
rewarded  with  lands  close  to  the  Tokugawa  holdings  for  their  faithful 
service.  By  the  eighteenth  century,  145  fudai  controlled  such  smaller 
han,  the  greatest  assessed  at  250,000  koku.  Members  of  the  fudai 
class  staffed  most  of  the  major  bakufu  offices.  Ninety-seven  han 
formed  the  third  group,  the  tozama  (outside  vassals),  former  oppo- 
nents or  new  allies.  The  tozama  were  located  mostly  on  the  periph- 
eries of  the  archipelago  and  collectively  controlled  nearly  10  million 
koku  of  productive  land.  Because  the  tozama  were  least  trusted  of 
the  daimyo,  they  were  the  most  cautiously  managed  and  gener- 
ously treated,  although  they  were  excluded  from  central  govern- 
ment positions. 

The  Tokugawa  not  only  consolidated  their  control  over  a  reuni- 
fied Japan,  they  also  had  unprecedented  power  over  the  emperor, 
the  court,  all  daimyo,  and  the  religious  orders.  The  emperor  was 
held  up  as  the  ultimate  source  of  political  sanction  for  the  shogun, 
who  ostensibly  was  the  vassal  of  the  imperial  family.  The  Tokugawa 
helped  the  imperial  family  recapture  its  old  glory  by  rebuilding  its 
palaces  and  granting  it  new  lands.  To  ensure  a  close  tie  between

the  imperial  clan  and  the  Tokugawa  family,  Ieyasu's  granddaughter 
was  made  an  imperial  consort  in  1619. 

A  code  of  laws  was  established  to  regulate  the  daimyd  houses.  The 
code  encompassed  private  conduct,  marriage,  dress,  and  types  of 
weapons  and  numbers  of  troops  allowed;  required  alternate-year  resi- 
dence at  Edo;  prohibited  the  construction  of  ocean-going  ships; 
proscribed  Christianity;  and  stipulated  that  bakufu  regulations  were 
the  national  law.  Although  the  daimyd  were  not  taxed  per  se,  they 
were  regularly  levied  for  contributions  for  military  and  logistical  sup- 
port and  such  public  works  projects  as  castles,  roads,  bridges,  and 
palaces.  The  various  regulations  and  levies  not  only  strengthened 
the  Tokugawa  but  depleted  the  wealth  of  the  daimyd,  thus  weaken- 
ing their  threat  to  the  central  administration.  The  han,  once  military- 
centered  domains,  became  mere  local  administrative  units.  The  dai- 
myd did  have  full  administrative  control  over  their  territory  and  com- 
plex systems  of  retainers,  bureaucrats,  and  commoners.  Loyalty  was 
exacted  from  religious  foundations,  already  greatly  weakened  by 
Nobunaga  and  Hideyoshi,  through  a  variety  of  control  mechanisms. 

Seclusion  and  Social  Control 

Like  Hideyoshi,  Ieyasu  encouraged  foreign  trade  but  also  was 


29

suspicious  of  outsiders.  He  wanted  to  make  Edo  a  major  port,  but 
once  he  learned  that  the  Europeans  favored  ports  in  Kyushu  and 
that  China  had  rejected  his  plans  for  official  trade,  he  moved  to 
control  existing  trade  and  allowed  only  certain  ports  to  handle  spe- 
cific kinds  of  commodities. 

The  ' ' Christian  problem"  was,  in  effect,  a  problem  in  control- 
ling both  the  Christian  daimyo  in  Kyushu  and  trade  with  the  Euro- 
peans. By  1612  the  shogun's  retainers  and  residents  of  Tokugawa 
lands  had  been  ordered  to  foreswear  Christianity.  More  restric- 
tions came  in  1616  (the  restriction  of  foreign  trade  to  Nagasaki  and 
Hirado,  an  island  northwest  of  Kyushu),  1622  (the  execution  of 
120  missionaries  and  converts),  1624  (the  expulsion  of  the  Span- 
ish), and  1629  (the  execution  of  thousands  of  Christians).  Finally, 
in  1635,  an  edict  prohibited  any  Japanese  from  traveling  outside 
Japan  or,  if  someone  left,  from  ever  returning.  In  1636  the  Por- 
tuguese were  restricted  to  Deshima,  a  man-made  islet — and  thus, 
not  true  Japanese  soil — in  Nagasaki's  harbor. 

The  Shimabara  Rebellion  of  1637-38,  in  which  discontented 
Christian  samurai  and  peasants  rebelled  against  the  bakufu — and 
Edo  called  in  Dutch  ships  to  bombard  the  rebel  stronghold — marked 
the  end  of  the  Christian  movement.  Soon  thereafter  the  Portuguese 
were  permanently  expelled,  members  of  the  Portuguese  diplomatic 
mission  were  executed,  all  subjects  were  ordered  to  register  at  a 
Buddhist  or  Shinto  temple,  and  the  Dutch  and  Chinese  were  re- 
stricted respectively  to  Deshima  and  a  special  quarter  in  Nagasaki. 
Besides  small  trade  of  some  outer  daimyo  with  Korea  and  the  Ryukyu 
Islands,  to  the  southwest  of  Japan's  main  islands,  by  1641  foreign 
contacts  were  limited  to  Nagasaki. 

Japanese  society  of  the  Tokugawa  period  was  influenced  by  Con- 
fucian principles  of  social  order.  At  the  top  of  the  hierarchy,  but 
removed  from  political  power,  were  the  imperial  court  families  at 
Kyoto.  The  real  political  power  holders  were  the  samurai  followed 
by  the  rest  of  society,  in  descending  hierarchical  order:  farmers, 
who  were  organized  into  villages,  artisans,  and  merchants.  Urban 
dwellers,  often  well-to-do  merchants,  were  known  as  chonin  (towns- 
people) and  confined  to  special  districts.  The  individual  had  no 
legal  rights  in  Tokugawa  Japan.  The  family  was  the  smallest  legal 
entity,  and  the  maintenance  of  family  status  and  privileges  was  of 
great  importance  at  all  levels  of  society. 

Economic  Development 

Economic  development  during  the  Tokugawa  period  included 
urbanization,  more  shipping  of  commodities,  a  significant  expan- 
sion of  domestic  and,  initially,  foreign  commerce,  and  a  diffusion 


30

of  trade  and  handicraft  industries.  Edo  had  a  population  of  more 
than  1  million  and  Osaka  and  Kyoto  each  had  more  than  400,000 
inhabitants  by  the  mid-eighteenth  century.  Many  other  castie  towns 
grew  as  well.  Osaka  and  Kyoto  became  busy  trading  and  handicraft 
production  centers  while  Edo  was  the  center  for  the  supply  of  food 
and  essential  urban  consumer  goods.  The  construction  trades 
flourished  along  with  banking  facilities  and  merchant  associations. 
Increasingly,  han  authorities  oversaw  the  rising  agricultural  produc- 
tion and  the  spread  of  rural  handicrafts. 

Intellectual  Trends 

The  flourishing  of  neo-Confucianism  was  the  major  intellectual 
development  of  the  Tokugawa  period.  Confucian  studies  had  long 
been  kept  active  in  Japan  by  Buddhist  clerics,  but  during  the 
Tokugawa  period,  Confucianism  emerged  from  Buddhist  religious 
control.  This  system  of  thought  increased  attention  to  a  secular  view 
of  man  and  society.  The  ethical  humanism,  rationalism,  and  histor- 
ical perspective  of  neo-Confucian  doctrine  appealed  to  the  official 
class,  and  by  the  mid-seventeenth  century,  it  was  Japan's  dominant 
legal  philosophy  and  contributed  direcdy  to  the  development  of  the 
kokugaku  (national  learning)  school  of  thought. 

Advanced  studies  and  growing  applications  of  neo-Confucianism 
contributed  to  the  transition  of  the  social  and  political  order  from 
feudal  norms  to  class-and  large- group-oriented  practices.  The  rule 
of  the  people  or  Confucian  man  was  gradually  replaced  by  the  rule 
of  laws.  New  laws  were  developed  and  new  administrative  devices 
were  instituted.  A  new  theory  of  government  and  a  new  vision  of 
society  emerged  as  a  means  of  justifying  more  comprehensive  gover- 
nance by  the  bakufu.  Each  person  had  a  distinct  place  in  society  and 
was  expected  to  work  to  fulfill  his  mission  in  life.  The  people  were 
to  be  ruled  with  benevolence  by  those  whose  assigned  duty  it  was 
to  rule.  Government  was  all-powerful  but  responsible  and  humane. 
Although  the  class  system  was  influenced  by  neo-Confucianism,  it 
was  not  identical  to  it.  Whereas  soldiers  and  clergy  were  at  the  bot- 
tom of  the  hierarchy  in  the  Chinese  model,  in  Japan  some  mem- 
bers of  these  classes  constituted  the  ruling  elite. 

Members  of  the  samurai  class  adhered  to  bushi  traditions  with  a 
renewed  interest  in  Japanese  history  and  cultivating  the  ways  of  Con- 
fucian scholar- administrators,  resulting  in  the  development  of  the 
concept  of  bushido  (the  way  of  the  warrior — see  Glossary).  Another 
special  way  of  life — chonindo — also  emerged.  Chonindo  (the  way  of 
the  townspeople)  was  a  distinct  culture  that  arose  in  cities  such  as 
Osaka,  Kyoto,  and  Edo.  It  encouraged  aspiration  to  bushido 
qualities — diligence,  honesty,  honor,  loyalty,  and  frugality — while

blending  Shinto,  neo-Confucian,  and  Buddhist  beliefs.  Study  of 
mathematics,  astronomy,  cartography,  engineering,  and  medicine 
were  also  encouraged.  Emphasis  was  placed  on  quality  of  work- 
manship, especially  in  the  arts.  For  the  first  time,  urban  popula- 
tions had  the  means  and  leisure  time  to  support  a  new  mass  culture. 
Their  search  for  enjoyment  became  known  as  ukiyo  (the  floating 
world),  an  ideal  world  of  fashion  and  popular  entertainment.  Profes- 
sional female  entertainers  (geisha),  music,  popular  stories,  Kabuki 
and  bunraku  (puppet)  theater,  poetry,  a  rich  literature,  and  art,  ex- 
emplified by  beautiful  woodblock  prints  (known  as  ukiyo-e),  were 
all  part  of  this  flowering  culture  (see  Visual  Arts,  ch.  3).  Litera- 
ture also  flourished  with  the  talented  examples  of  the  playwright 
Chikamatsu  Monzaemon  (1653-1724)  and  the  poet,  essayist,  and 
travel  writer  Matsuo  Basho  (1644-94). 

Buddhism  and  Shinto  were  both  still  important  in  Tokugawa 
Japan.  Buddhism,  combined  with  neo-Confucianism,  provided 
standards  of  social  behavior.  Although  not  as  powerful  politically 
as  it  had  been  in  the  past,  Buddhism  was  espoused  by  the  upper 
classes.  Proscriptions  against  Christianity  benefited  Buddhism  in 
1640  when  the  bakufu  ordered  everyone  to  register  at  a  temple.  The 
rigid  separation  of  Tokugawa  society  into  han,  villages,  wards,  and 
households  helped  reaffirm  local  Shinto  attachments.  Shinto  pro- 
vided spiritual  support  to  the  political  order  and  was  an  important 
tie  between  the  individual  and  his  community.  Shinto  also  helped 
preserve  a  sense  of  national  identity. 

Shinto  eventually  assumed  an  intellectual  form  as  shaped  by  neo- 
Confucian  rationalism  and  materialism.  The  kokugaku  movement 
emerged  from  the  interactions  of  these  two  belief  systems.  Kokugaku 
contributed  to  the  emperor-centered  nationalism  of  modern  Japan 
and  the  revival  of  Shinto  as  a  national  creed  in  the  eighteenth  and 
nineteenth  centuries.  The  Kojiki,  Nihongi,  and  Man'yoshu  were  all 
studied  anew  in  the  search  for  the  Japanese  spirit.  Some  purists  in 
the  kokugaku  movement  even  criticized  the  Confucian  and  Buddhist 
influences — in  effect,  foreign  ones — for  contaminating  Japan's  an- 
cient ways.  Japan  was  the  land  of  the  kami  and,  as  such,  had  a  spe- 
cial destiny. 

Knowledge  of  the  West  during  the  early  Tokugawa  was  restricted 
to  a  tiny  school  of  thought  known  as  Rangaku  (Dutch  Learning). 
Its  adherents  were  mostly  in  Nagasaki,  where  the  Dutch  outpost 
was  located  on  Deshima  Island. 

Decline  of  the  Tokugawa 

The  Tokugawa  did  not  eventually  collapse  simply  because  of  in- 
trinsic failures.  Foreign  intrusions  helped  to  precipitate  a  complex 


32 


Historical  Setting 


political  struggle  between  the  bakufu  and  a  coalition  of  its  critics. 
The  continuity  of  the  anti-bakufu  movement  in  the  mid-nineteenth 
century  would  finally  bring  down  the  Tokugawa.  From  the  out- 
set, the  Tokugawa  attempted  to  restrict  families'  accumulation  of 
wealth  and  fostered  a  "back  to  the  soil"  policy,  in  which  the  farmer, 
the  ultimate  producer,  was  the  ideal  person  in  society.  Despite  these 
efforts  to  restrict  wealth,  and  partly  because  of  the  extraordinary 
period  of  peace,  the  standard  of  living  for  urban  and  rural  dwellers 
alike  grew  significantiy  during  the  Tokugawa  period.  Better  means 
of  crop  production,  transportation,  housing,  food,  and  entertain- 
ment were  all  available,  as  was  more  leisure  time,  at  least  for  urban 
dwellers.  The  literacy  rate  was  high  for  a  preindustrial  society,  and 
cultural  values  were  redefined  and  widely  imparted  throughout  the 
samurai  and  chonin  classes.  Despite  the  reappearance  of  guilds,  eco- 
nomic activities  went  well  beyond  the  restrictive  nature  of  the  guilds, 
and  commerce  spread  and  a  money  economy  developed.  Although 
government  heavily  restricted  the  merchants  and  viewed  them  as 
unproductive  and  usurious  members  of  society,  the  samurai,  who 
gradually  became  separated  from  their  rural  ties,  depended  greatly 
on  the  merchants  and  artisans  for  consumer  goods,  artistic  interests, 
and  loans.  In  this  way,  a  subtle  subversion  of  the  warrior  class  by 
the  chonin  took  place. 

A  struggle  arose  in  the  face  of  political  limitations  that  the  shogun 
imposed  on  the  entrepreneurial  class.  The  government  ideal  of  an 
agrarian  society  failed  to  square  with  the  reality  of  commercial  dis- 
tribution. A  huge  government  bureaucracy  had  evolved,  which  now 
stagnated  because  of  its  discrepancy  with  a  new  and  evolving  so- 
cial order.  Compounding  the  situation,  the  population  increased 
significantly  during  the  first  half  of  the  Tokugawa  period.  Although 
the  magnitude  and  growth  rates  are  uncertain,  there  were  at  least 
26  million  commoners  and  about  4  million  members  of  samurai 
families  and  their  attendants  when  the  first  nationwide  census  was 
taken  in  1721.  Drought,  followed  by  crop  shortages  and  starva- 
tion, resulted  in  twenty  great  famines  between  1675  and  1837. 
Peasant  unrest  grew,  and  by  the  late  eighteenth  century,  mass  pro- 
tests over  taxes  and  food  shortages  had  become  commonplace.  New- 
ly landless  families  became  tenant  farmers  while  the  displaced  rural 
poor  moved  into  the  cities.  As  the  fortunes  of  previously  well-to- 
do  families  declined,  others  moved  in  to  accumulate  land,  and  a 
new,  wealthy  farming  class  emerged.  Those  people  who  benefited 
were  able  to  diversify  production  and  to  hire  laborers,  while  others 
were  left  discontented.  Many  samurai  fell  on  hard  times  and  were 
forced  into  handicraft  production  and  wage  jobs  for  merchants.

Western  intrusions  were  on  the  increase  in  early  nineteenth  cen- 
tury. Russian  warships  and  traders  encroached  on  Karafuto  (today 
the  Soviet  island  of  Sakhalin)  and  the  Kuril  Islands,  the  southern- 
most of  which  are  considered  by  the  Japanese  as  the  northern  islands 
of  Hokkaido.  A  British  warship  entered  Nagasaki  Harbor  search- 
ing for  enemy  Dutch  ships  in  1808,  and  other  warships  and  whal- 
ers were  seen  in  Japanese  waters  with  increasing  frequency  in  the 
1810s  and  1820s.  Whalers  and  trading  ships  from  the  United  States 
also  arrived  on  Japan's  shores.  Although  the  Japanese  made  some 
minor  concessions  and  allowed  some  landings,  they  largely  at- 
tempted to  keep  all  foreigners  out,  sometimes  using  force.  Ran- 
gaku  became  crucial  not  only  in  understanding  the  foreign 
£ 'barbarians"  but  in  using  the  knowledge  gained  from  the  West 
to  fend  them  off. 

By  the  1830s,  there  was  a  general  sense  of  crisis.  Famines  and 
natural  disasters  hit  hard,  and  unrest  led  to  a  peasant  uprising 
against  officials  and  merchants  in  Osaka  in  1837.  Although  it  lasted 
only  a  day,  the  uprising  made  a  dramatic  impression.  Remedies 
came  in  the  form  of  traditional  solutions  that  sought  to  reform  moral 
decay  rather  than  institutional  problems.  The  shogun's  advisers 
pushed  for  a  return  to  the  martial  spirit,  more  restrictions  on  for- 
eign trade  and  contacts,  suppression  of  Rangaku,  censorship  of  liter- 
ature, and  elimination  of  "luxury"  in  the  government  and  samurai 
class.  Others  sought  the  overthrow  of  the  Tokugawa  and  espoused 
the  political  doctrine  of  sonnd-joi  (revere  the  emperor,  expel  the  bar- 
barians), which  called  for  unity  under  imperial  rule  and  opposed 
foreign  intrusions.  The  bakufu  persevered  for  the  time  being  amidst 
growing  concerns  over  Western  successes  in  establishing  colonial 
enclaves  in  China  following  the  Opium  War  of  1839-42.  More  re- 
forms were  ordered,  especially  in  the  economic  sector,  to  strengthen 
Japan  against  the  Western  threat. 

Japan  turned  down  a  demand  from  the  United  States,  which 
was  greatly  expanding  its  own  presence  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region, 
to  establish  diplomatic  relations  when  Commodore  James  Biddle 
appeared  in  Edo  Bay  with  two  warships  in  July  1846.  However, 
when  Commodore  Matthew  C.  Perry's  four-ship  squadron  ap- 
peared in  Edo  Bay  in  July  1853,  the  bakufu  was  thrown  into  tur- 
moil. The  chairman  of  the  senior  councillors,  Abe  Masahiro 
(1819-57),  was  responsible  for  dealing  with  the  Americans.  Hav- 
ing no  precedent  to  manage  this  threat  to  national  security,  Abe 
tried  to  balance  the  desires  of  the  senior  councillors  to  compromise 
with  the  foreigners,  of  the  emperor  who  wanted  to  keep  the  foreign- 
ers out,  and  of  the  daimyo  who  wanted  to  go  to  war.  Lacking  con- 
sensus, Abe  decided  to  compromise  by  accepting  Perry's  demands

for  opening  Japan  to  foreign  trade  while  also  making  military  prepa- 
rations. In  March  1854,  the  Treaty  of  Peace  and  Amity  (or  Treaty 
of  Kanagawa)  opened  two  ports  to  American  ships  seeking  provi- 
sions, guaranteed  good  treatment  to  shipwrecked  American  sailors, 
and  allowed  a  United  States  consul  to  take  up  residence  in  Shimoda, 
a  seaport  on  the  Izu  Peninsula,  southwest  of  Edo.  A  commercial 
treaty,  opening  still  more  areas  to  American  trade,  was  forced  on 
the  bakufu  five  years  later. 

The  resulting  damage  to  the  bakufu  was  significant.  Debate  over 
government  policy  was  unusual  and  had  engendered  public  cri- 
ticism of  the  bakufu.  In  the  hope  of  enlisting  the  support  of  new 
allies,  Abe,  to  the  consternation  of  the  fudai,  had  consulted  with 
the  shinpan  and  tozama  daimyd,  further  undermining  the  already 
weakened  bakufu.  In  the  Ansei  Reform  (1854-56),  Abe  then  tried 
to  strengthen  the  regime  by  ordering  Dutch  warships  and  arma- 
ments from  the  Netherlands  and  building  new  port  defenses.  In 
1855  a  naval  training  school  with  Dutch  instructors  was  set  up  at 
Nagasaki,  and  a  We  stern- style  military  school  was  established  at 
Edo;  by  the  next  year,  the  government  was  translating  Western 
books.  Opposition  to  Abe  increased  within  fudai  circles,  which  op- 
posed opening  bakufu  councils  to  tozama  daimyd,  and  he  was  replaced 
in  1855  as  chairman  of  the  senior  councillors  by  Hotta  Masayoshi 
(1810-64). 

At  the  head  of  the  dissident  faction  was  Tokugawa  Nariaki,  who 
had  long  embraced  a  militant  loyalty  to  the  emperor  along  with 
antiforeign  sentiments,  and  who  had  been  put  in  charge  of  national 
defense  in  1854.  The  Mito  school — based  on  neo-Confucian  and 
Shinto  principles — had  as  its  goal  the  restoration  of  the  imperial 
institution,  the  turning  back  of  the  West,  and  the  founding  of  a 
world  empire  under  the  divine  Yamato  Dynasty. 

In  the  final  years  of  the  Tokugawa,  foreign  contacts  increased 
as  more  concessions  were  granted  .  The  new  treaty  with  the  United 
States  in  1859  allowed  more  ports  to  be  opened  to  diplomatic 
representatives,  unsupervised  trade  at  four  additional  ports,  and 
foreign  residences  in  Osaka  and  Edo.  It  also  embodied  the  con- 
cept of  extraterritoriality  (foreigners  were  subject  to  the  laws  of  their 
own  countries  but  not  to  Japanese  law).  Hotta  lost  the  support  of 
key  daimyd,  and  when  Tokugawa  Nariaki  opposed  the  new  treaty, 
Hotta  sought  imperial  sanction.  The  court  officials,  perceiving  the 
weakness  of  the  bakufu,  rejected  Hotta' s  request  and  thus  suddenly 
embroiled  Kyoto  and  the  emperor  in  Japan's  internal  politics  for 
the  first  time  in  many  centuries.  When  the  shogun  died  without 
an  heir,  Nariaki  appealed  to  the  court  for  support  of  his  own  son, 
Tokugawa  Yoshinobu  (or  Keiki),  for  shogun,  a  candidate  favored

by  the  shinpan  and  tozama  daimyb.  The  fudai  won  the  power  strug- 
gle, however,  installing  Tokugawa  Yoshitomi,  arresting  Nariaki 
and  Keiki,  executing  Yoshida  Shoin  (1830-59,  a  leading  sonnb-jbi 
intellectual  who  had  opposed  the  American  treaty  and  plotted  a 
revolution  against  the  bakufu),  and  signing  treaties  with  the  United 
States  and  five  other  nations,  thus  ending  more  than  200  years  of 
exclusion. 

The  strong  measures  the  bakufu  took  to  reassert  its  dominance 
were  not  enough.  Revering  the  emperor  as  a  symbol  of  unity,  ex- 
tremists wrought  violence  and  death  against  the  bakufu  and  han 
authorities  and  foreigners.  Foreign  naval  retaliation  led  to  still 
another  concessionary  commercial  treaty  in  1865,  but  Yoshitomi 
was  unable  to  enforce  the  Western  treaties.  A  bakufu  army  was 
defeated  when  it  was  sent  to  crush  dissent  in  Satsuma  and  Choshu 
han  in  1866.  Finally,  in  1867,  the  emperor  died  and  was  succeeded 
by  his  minor  son  Mutsuhito;  Keiki  reluctantly  became  head  of  the 
Tokugawa  house  and  shogun.  He  tried  to  reorganize  the  govern- 
ment under  the  emperor  while  preserving  the  shogun 's  leadership 
role.  Fearing  the  growing  power  of  the  Satsuma  and  Choshu  daimyb, 
other  daimyo  called  for  returning  the  shogun 's  political  power 
to  the  emperor  and  a  council  of  daimyo  chaired  by  the  former 
Tokugawa  shogun.  Keiki  accepted  the  plan  in  late  1867  and 
resigned,  announcing  an  "imperial  restoration."  The  Satsuma, 
Choshu,  and  other  han  leaders  and  radical  courtiers,  however, 
rebelled,  seized  the  imperial  palace,  and  announced  their  own  resto- 
ration on  January  3,  1868.  The  bakufu  was  abolished,  Keiki  was 
reduced  to  the  ranks  of  the  common  daimyb,  and  the  Tokugawa 
army  gave  up  without  a  fight  (although  other  Tokugawa  forces 
fought  until  November  1868,  and  bakufu  naval  forces  continued 
to  hold  out  for  another  six  months). 

The  Emergence  of  Modern  Japan,  1868-1919 
The  Meiji  Restoration 

Those  people  who  wanted  to  end  Tokugawa  rule  did  not  envi- 
sion a  new  government  or  a  new  society;  they  merely  sought  the 
transfer  of  power  from  Edo  to  Kyoto  while  retaining  all  their  feudal 
prerogatives.  Instead,  a  profound  change  took  place.  The  emperor 
emerged  as  a  national  symbol  of  unity  in  the  midst  of  reforms  that 
were  much  more  radical  than  had  been  envisioned. 

The  first  reform  was  the  promulgation  of  the  Charter  Oath  in 
1868,  a  general  statement  of  the  aims  of  the  Meiji  leaders  to  boost 
morale  and  win  financial  support  for  the  new  government.  Its  five 
provisions  were  the  establishment  of  deliberative  assemblies,  the

involvement  of  all  classes  in  carrying  out  state  affairs,  freedom  of 
social  and  occupational  mobility,  replacement  of  "evil  customs" 
with  the  "just  laws  of  nature,"  and  an  international  search  for 
knowledge  to  strengthen  the  foundations  of  imperial  rule.  Implicit 
in  the  Charter  Oath  was  an  end  to  exclusive  political  rule  by  the 
bakufu  and  a  move  toward  more  democratic  participation  in  govern- 
ment. To  implement  the  Charter  Oath,  an  eleven- article  consti- 
tution was  drawn  up.  Besides  providing  for  a  new  Council  of  State, 
legislative  bodies,  and  systems  of  ranks  for  nobles  and  officials,  it 
limited  office  tenure  to  four  years,  allowed  public  balloting,  provided 
for  a  new  taxation  system,  and  ordered  new  local  administrative 
rules. 

The  Meiji  government  assured  the  foreign  powers  that  it  would 
abide  by  the  old  treaties  negotiated  by  the  bakufu  and  announced 
that  it  would  act  in  accordance  with  international  law.  Mutsuhito, 
who  was  to  reign  until  1912,  selected  a  new  reign  title — Meiji,  or 
Enlightened  Rule — to  mark  the  beginning  of  a  new  era  in  Japanese 
history.  To  further  dramatize  the  new  order,  the  capital  was  relo- 
cated from  Kyoto,  where  it  had  been  situated  since  794,  to  Tokyo 
(Eastern  Capital),  the  new  name  for  Edo.  In  a  move  critical  for 
the  consolidation  of  the  new  regime,  most  daimyd  voluntarily  sur- 
rendered their  land  and  census  records  to  the  emperor,  symboliz- 
ing that  the  land  and  people  were  under  the  emperor's  jurisdiction. 
Confirmed  in  their  hereditary  positions,  the  daimyd  became  gov- 
ernors, and  the  central  government  assumed  their  administrative 
expenses  and  paid  samurai  stipends.  The  han  were  replaced  with 
prefectures  in  1871 ,  and  authority  continued  to  flow  to  the  national 
government.  Officials  from  the  favored  former  han,  such  as 
Satsuma,  Choshu,  Tosa,  and  Hizen,  staffed  the  new  ministries. 
Formerly  out-of-favor  court  nobles  and  lower-ranking  but  more 
radical  samurai  replaced  bakufu  appointees,  daimyd,  and  old  court 
nobles  as  a  new  ruling  class  appeared. 

Inasmuch  as  the  Meiji  Restoration  had  sought  to  return  the  em- 
peror to  a  preeminent  position,  efforts  were  made  to  establish  a 
Shinto-oriented  state  much  like  the  state  of  1,000  years  earlier.  An 
Office  of  Shinto  Worship  was  established,  ranking  even  above  the 
Council  of  State  in  importance.  The  kokutai  ideas  of  the  Mito  school 
were  embraced,  and  the  divine  ancestry  of  the  imperial  house  em- 
phasized. The  government  supported  Shinto  teachers,  a  small  but 
important  move.  Although  the  Office  of  Shinto  Worship  was  de- 
moted in  1872,  by  1877  the  Home  Ministry  controlled  all  Shinto 
shrines  and  certain  Shinto  sects  were  given  state  recognition.  Shinto 
was  at  last  released  from  Buddhist  administration  and  its  proper- 
ties restored.  Although  Buddhism  suffered  from  state  sponsorship 


37 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

of  Shinto,  it  had  its  own  resurgence.  Christianity  was  also  legal- 
ized and  Confucianism  remained  an  important  ethical  doctrine. 
Increasingly,  however,  Japanese  thinkers  identified  with  Western 
ideology  and  methods. 

The  Meiji  oligarchy,  as  the  new  ruling  class  is  known  to  histori- 
ans, was  a  privileged  clique  that  exercised  imperial  power,  some- 
times despotically.  The  members  of  this  class  were  adherents  to 
kokugaku  and  believed  they  were  the  creators  of  a  new  order  as  grand 
as  that  established  by  Japan's  original  founders.  Two  of  the  major 
figures  of  this  group  were  Okubo  Toshimichi  (1832-78),  son  of  a 
Satsuma  retainer,  and  Satsuma  samurai  Saigo  Takamori  (1827-77), 
who  had  joined  forces  with  Choshu,  Tosa,  and  Hizen  to  overthrow 
the  Tokugawa.  Okubo  became  minister  of  finance  and  Saigo  a  field 
marshal;  both  were  imperial  councillors.  Kido  Koin  (1833-77),  native 
of  Choshu,  student  of  Yoshida  Shoin,  and  coconspirator  with  Oku- 
bo and  Saigo,  became  minister  of  education  and  chairman  of  the 
Governors'  Conference  and  pushed  for  constitutional  government. 
Also  prominent  were  Iwakura  Tomomi  (1825-83),  a  Kyoto  native 
who  had  opposed  the  Tokugawa  and  was  to  become  the  first  am- 
bassador to  the  United  States,  and  Okuma  Shigenobu  (1838-1922), 
of  Hizen,  a  student  of  Rangaku,  Chinese,  and  English,  who  held 
various  ministerial  portfolios,  eventually  becoming  prime  minister 
in  1898. 

To  accomplish  the  new  order's  goals,  the  Meiji  oligarchy  set  out 
to  abolish  the  Tokugawa  class  system  through  a  series  of  economic 
and  social  reforms.  Bakufu  revenues  had  depended  on  taxes  on 
Tokugawa  and  other  daimyo  lands,  loans  from  wealthy  peasants  and 
urban  merchants,  limited  customs  fees,  and  reluctantly  accepted 
foreign  loans.  To  provide  revenue  and  develop  a  sound  infrastruc- 
ture, the  new  government  financed  harbor  improvements,  light- 
houses, machinery  imports,  schools,  overseas  study  for  students, 
salaries  for  foreign  teachers  and  advisers,  modernization  of  the  army 
and  navy,  railroads  and  telegraph  networks,  and  foreign  diplomatic 
missions. 

Difficult  economic  times,  manifested  by  increasing  incidents  of 
agrarian  rioting,  led  to  calls  for  social  reforms.  Besides  the  old  high 
rents,  taxes,  and  interest  rates,  the  average  citizen  was  faced  with 
cash  payments  for  new  taxes,  military  conscription,  and  tuition 
charges  for  compulsory  education.  The  people  needed  more  time 
for  productive  pursuits  while  correcting  social  abuses  of  the  past. 
To  achieve  these  reforms,  the  old  Tokugawa  class  system  of 
samurai,  farmer,  artisan,  and  merchant  was  abolished  by  1871, 
and,  even  though  old  prejudices  and  status  consciousness  con- 
tinued, all  were  theoretically  equal  before  the  law.  Actually  helping

to  perpetuate  social  distinctions,  the  government  named  new  so- 
cial divisions:  the  former  daimyo  became  nobility,  the  samurai  be- 
came gentry,  and  all  others  became  commoners.  Daimyo  and 
samurai  pensions  were  paid  off  in  lump  sums,  and  the  samurai 
later  lost  their  exclusive  claim  to  military  positions.  Former  samurai 
found  new  pursuits  as  bureaucrats,  teachers,  army  officers,  police 
officials,  journalists,  scholars,  colonists  in  the  northern  parts  of 
Japan,  bankers,  and  businessmen.  These  occupations  helped  stem 
some  of  the  discontent  this  large  group  felt;  some  profited  im- 
mensely, but  many  were  not  successful  and  provided  significant 
opposition  in  the  ensuing  years  (see  Opposition  to  the  Meiji  Oli- 
garchy, this  ch.). 

Additionally,  between  1871  and  1873,  a  series  of  land  and  tax 
laws  were  enacted  as  the  basis  for  modern  fiscal  policy.  Private 
ownership  was  legalized,  deeds  were  issued,  and  lands  were  as- 
sessed at  a  fair  market  value  with  taxes  paid  in  cash  rather  than 
in  kind  as  in  pre-Meiji  days  and  at  slightly  lower  rates. 

Undeterred  by  opposition,  the  Meiji  leaders  continued  to  modern- 
ize the  nation  through  government- sponsored  telegraph  cable  links

to  all  major  Japanese  cities  and  the  Asian  mainland,  and  the  con- 
struction of  railroads,  shipyards,  munitions  factories,  mines,  tex- 
tile manufacturing  facilities,  factories,  and  experimental  agriculture 
stations.  Much  concerned  about  national  security,  the  leaders  made 
significant  efforts  at  military  modernization,  which  included  es- 
tablishing a  small  standing  army  and  a  large  reserve  system,  and 
compulsory  militia  service  for  all  men  (see  Militarism  Before  1945, 
ch.  8).  Foreign  military  systems  were  studied,  foreign  advisers 
brought  in,  and  Japanese  cadets  sent  abroad  to  European  and 
United  States  military  and  naval  schools. 

Foreign  Relations 

The  Meiji  leaders  also  modernized  foreign  policy,  an  important 
step  in  making  Japan  a  full  member  of  the  international  commu- 
nity. The  traditional  East  Asia  world  view  was  based  not  on  an 
international  society  of  national  units  but  on  cultural  distinctions 
and  tributary  relationships;  monks,  scholars,  and  artists,  rather  than 
professional  diplomatic  envoys,  had  generally  served  as  the  con- 
veyors of  foreign  policy.  Foreign  relations  were  related  more  to 
the  sovereign's  desires  than  to  the  public  interest.  For  Japan  to 
emerge  from  the  feudal  period,  it  had  to  avoid  the  fate  of  other 
Asian  countries  by  establishing  genuine  national  independence  and 
equality.  The  Meiji  oligarchy  was  aware  of  Western  progress,  and 
'  'learning  missions"  were  sent  abroad  to  absorb  as  much^>f  it  as 
possible.  One  such  mission,  led  by  Iwakura,  Kido,  and  Okubo, 
and  containing  forty-eight  members  in  total,  spent  two  years 
(1871-73)  touring  the  United  States  and  Europe,  studying  govern- 
ment institutions,  courts,  prison  systems,  schools,  the  import-export 
business,  factories,  shipyards,  glass  plants,  mines,  and  other  en- 
terprises. Upon  returning,  mission  members  called  for  domestic 
reforms  that  would  help  Japan  catch  up  with  the  West.  The  revi- 
sion of  unequal  treaties  forced  on  Japan  became  a  top  priority.  The 
returned  envoys  also  sketched  a  new  vision  for  a  modernized  Japan's 
leadership  role  in  Asia,  but  they  realized  that  this  role  required 
that  Japan  develop  its  national  strength,  cultivate  nationalism 
among  the  population,  and  carefully  craft  policies  toward  poten- 
tial enemies.  No  longer  could  Westerners  be  seen  as  "barbarians," 
for  example.  In  time,  Japan  formed  a  corps  of  professional 
diplomats. 

Although  he  never  assumed  a  government  post,  another  influen- 
tial Meiji  period  figure  was  Fukuzawa  Yukichi  (1835-1901).  He 
was  a  prolific  writer  on  many  subjects,  the  founder  of  schools  and 
a  newspaper,  and,  above  all,  an  educator  bent  on  impressing  his 
fellow  Japanese  with  the  merits  of  Westernization.

Historical  Setting 


Japan  was  shortly  to  test  its  new  world  outlook.  Disputes  with 
China  over  sovereignty  of  the  Ryukyii  Islands,  with  Russia  over 
sovereignty  of  the  Kuril  Islands  and  Sakhalin,  and  with  Korea  over 
the  Korean  court's  refusal  to  recognize  the  new  Meiji  government 
and  its  envoys  were  all  settled  diplomatically  between  1874  and 
1876.  Military  threats  had  been  made  in  the  Chinese  and  Korean 
affairs,  and  it  seemed  to  many  that  Japan  would  soon  use  military 
means  to  achieve  its  goals. 

Opposition  to  the  Meiji  Oligarchy 

The  1873  Korean  crisis  resulted  in  the  resignation  of  military- 
expedition  proponents  Saigo  and  Councillor  of  State  Eto  Shimpei 
(1834-74).  Eto,  the  founder  of  various  patriotic  organizations,  con- 
spired with  other  discontented  elements  to  start  an  armed  insur- 
rection against  government  troops  in  Saga,  the  capital  of  his  native 
prefecture  in  Kyushu  in  1874.  Charged  with  suppressing  the  revolt, 
Okubo  swiftly  crushed  Eto,  who  had  appealed  unsuccessfully  to 
Saigo  for  help.  Three  years  later,  the  last  major  armed  uprising — 
but  most  serious  challenge  to  the  Meiji  government — took  shape 
in  the  Satsuma  Rebellion,  this  time  with  Saigo  playing  an  active 
role.  The  Saga  Rebellion  and  other  agrarian  and  samurai  upris- 
ings mounted  in  protest  to  the  Meiji  reforms  had  been  easily  put 
down  by  the  army.  Satsuma' s  former  samurai  were  numerous, 
however,  and  they  had  a  long  tradition  of  opposition  to  central 
authority.  Saigo,  with  some  reluctance  and  only  after  more 
widespread  dissatisfaction  with  the  Meiji  reforms,  raised  a  rebel- 
lion in  1877.  Both  sides  fought  well,  but  the  modern  weaponry  and 
better  financing  of  the  government  forces  ended  the  Satsuma  Re- 
bellion. Although  he  was  defeated  and  committed  suicide,  Saigo 
was  not  branded  a  traitor  and  became  a  heroic  figure  in  Japanese 
history.  The  suppression  of  the  Satsuma  Rebellion  marked  the  end 
of  serious  threats  to  the  Meiji  regime  but  was  sobering  to  the  oligar- 
chy. The  fight  drained  the  national  treasury,  led  to  serious  infla- 
tion, and  forced  land  values — and  badly  needed  taxes — down.  Most 
importantly,  calls  for  reform  were  renewed. 

The  Development  of  Representative  Government 

The  major  institutional  accomplishment  after  the  Satsuma  Re- 
bellion was  the  start  of  the  trend  toward  developing  representative 
government.  People  who  had  been  forced  out  or  left  out  of  the 
governing  apparatus  after  the  Meiji  Restoration  had  witnessed  or 
heard  of  the  success  of  representative  institutions  in  other  coun- 
tries of  the  world  and  applied  greater  pressure  for  a  voice  in 
government. 


41 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


A  major  proponent  of  representative  government  was  Itagaki 
Taisuke  (1837-1919),  a  powerful  leader  of  Tosa  forces  who  had 
resigned  from  his  Council  of  State  position  over  the  Korean  affair 
in  1873.  Itagaki  sought  peaceful  rather  than  rebellious  means  to 
gain  a  voice  in  government.  He  started  a  school  and  a  movement 
aimed  at  establishing  a  constitutional  monarchy  and  a  legislative 
assembly.  Itagaki  and  others  wrote  the  Tosa  Memorial  in  1874 
criticizing  the  unbridled  power  of  the  oligarchy  and  calling  for  the 
immediate  establishment  of  representative  government.  Dissatis- 
fied with  the  pace  of  reform  after  having  rejoined  the  Council  of 
State  in  1875,  Itagaki  organized  his  followers  and  other  democratic 
proponents  into  the  nationwide  Aikokusha  (Society  of  Patriots)  to 
push  for  representative  government  in  1878.  In  1881,  in  an  action 
for  which  he  is  best  known,  Itagaki  helped  found  the  Jiyuto  (Liberal 
Party),  which  favored  French  political  doctrines.  In  1882  Okuma 
established  the  Rikken  Kaishinto  (Constitutional  Progressive  Party), 
which  called  for  a  British- style  constitutional  democracy.  In  re- 
sponse, government  bureaucrats,  local  government  officials,  and 
other  conservatives  established  the  Rikken  Teiseito  (Imperial  Rule 
Party),  a  progovernment  party,  in  1882.  Numerous  political  demon- 
strations followed,  some  of  them  violent,  resulting  in  further  govern- 
ment restrictions.  The  restrictions  hindered  the  political  parties  and 
led  to  divisiveness  within  and  among  them.  The  Jiyiito,  which  had 
opposed  the  Kaishinto,  was  disbanded  in  1884,  and  Okuma  re- 
signed as  Kaishinto  president. 

Government  leaders,  long  preoccupied  with  violent  threats  to 
stability  and  the  serious  leadership  split  over  the  Korean  affair, 
generally  agreed  that  constitutional  government  should  someday 
be  established.  Kido  had  favored  a  constitutional  form  of  govern- 
ment since  before  1874,  and  several  proposals  that  provided  for 
constitutional  guarantees  had  been  drafted.  The  oligarchy,  however, 
while  acknowledging  the  realities  of  political  pressure,  was  deter- 
mined to  keep  control.  Thus,  modest  steps  were  taken.  The  Osaka 
Conference  in  1875  resulted  in  the  reorganization  of  government 
with  an  independent  judiciary  and  an  appointed  Council  of  Elders 
(Genronin)  tasked  with  reviewing  proposals  for  a  legislature.  The 
emperor  declared  that  "constitutional  government  shall  be  estab- 
lished in  gradual  stages"  as  he  ordered  the  Council  of  Elders  to 
draft  a  constitution.  Three  years  later,  the  Conference  of  Prefec- 
tural  Governors  established  elected  prefectural  assemblies.  Although 
limited  in  their  authority,  these  assemblies  represented  a  move  in 
the  direction  of  representative  government  at  the  national  level, 
and  by  1880  assemblies  also  had  been  formed  in  villages  and  towns. 
In  1880  delegates  from  twenty-four  prefectures  held  a  national 


42

convention  to  establish  the  Kokkai  Kisei  Domei  (League  for  Es- 
tablishing a  National  Assembly). 

Although  the  government  was  not  opposed  to  parliamentary  rule, 
confronted  with  the  drive  for  "people's  rights,"  it  continued  to 
try  to  control  the  political  situation.  New  laws  in  1875  prohibited 
press  criticism  of  the  government  or  discussion  of  national  laws. 
The  Public  Assembly  Law  (1880)  severely  limited  public  gather- 
ings by  disallowing  attendance  by  civil  servants  and  requiring  police 
permission  for  all  meetings.  Within  the  ruling  circle,  however,  and 
despite  the  conservative  approach  of  the  leadership,  Okuma  con- 
tinued as  a  lone  advocate  of  British- style  government,  a  govern- 
ment with  political  parties  and  a  cabinet  organized  by  the  majority 
party,  answerable  to  the  national  assembly.  He  called  for  elections 
to  be  held  by  1882  and  for  a  national  assembly  to  be  convoked  by 
1883;  in  doing  so,  he  precipitated  a  political  crisis  that  ended  with 
an  1881  imperial  rescript  declaring  the  establishment  of  a  national 
assembly  in  1890  and  dismissing  Okuma. 

Rejecting  the  British  model,  Iwakura  and  other  conservatives 
borrowed  heavily  from  the  Prussian  constitutional  system.  One  of 
the  Meiji  oligarchy,  Ito  Hirobumi  (1841-1909),  a  Choshu  native 
long  involved  in  government  affairs,  was  charged  with  drafting 
Japan's  constitution.  He  led  a  Constitutional  Study  Mission  abroad 
in  1882,  spending  most  of  his  time  in  Germany.  He  rejected  the 
United  States  Constitution  as  "too  liberal"  and  the  British  sys- 
tem as  too  unwieldy  and  having  a  parliament  with  too  much  con- 
trol over  the  monarchy;  the  French  and  Spanish  models  were 
rejected  as  tending  toward  despotism. 

On  Ito's  return,  one  of  the  first  acts  of  the  government  was  to 
establish  new  ranks  for  the  nobility.  Five  hundred  persons  from 
the  old  court  nobility,  former  daimyo,  and  samurai  who  had  provided 
valuable  service  to  the  emperor  were  organized  in  five  ranks:  prince, 
marquis,  count,  viscount,  and  baron.  Ito  was  put  in  charge  of  the 
new  Bureau  for  Investigation  of  Constitutional  Systems  in  1884, 
and  the  Council  of  State  was  replaced  in  1885  with  a  cabinet  headed 
by  Ito  as  prime  minister.  The  positions  of  chancellor,  minister  of 
the  left,  and  minister  of  the  right,  which  had  existed  since  the 
seventh  century  as  advisory  positions  to  the  emperor,  were  all 
abolished.  In  their  place,  the  Privy  Council  was  established  in  1888, 
to  evaluate  the  forthcoming  constitution  and  to  advise  the  emperor. 
To  further  strengthen  the  authority  of  the  state,  the  Supreme  War 
Council  was  established  under  the  leadership  of  Yamagata  Aritomo 
(1838-1922),  a  Choshu  native  who  has  been  credited  with  the  found- 
ing of  the  modern  Japanese  army  and  was  to  become  the  first  con- 
stitutional prime  minister.  The  Supreme  War  Council  developed 


43

a  German-style  general  staff  system  with  a  chief  of  staff  who  had 
direct  access  to  the  emperor  and  could  operate  independently  of 
the  army  minister  and  civilian  officials. 

When  finally  granted  by  the  emperor  as  a  sign  of  his  sharing 
his  authority  and  giving  rights  and  liberties  to  his  subjects,  the  1889 
Constitution  of  the  Empire  of  Japan  (the  Meiji  Constitution)  pro- 
vided for  the  Imperial  Diet  (Teikoku  Gikai),  composed  of  a  popu- 
larly elected  House  of  Representatives  with  a  very  limited  franchise 
of  male  citizens  who  paid  ¥15  (for  value  of  the  yen — see  Glossary) 
in  national  taxes,  about  1  percent  of  the  population;  the  House 
of  Peers,  composed  of  nobility  and  imperial  appointees;  and  a  cabi- 
net responsible  to  the  emperor  and  independent  of  the  legislature. 
The  Diet  could  approve  government  legislation  and  initiate  laws, 
make  representations  to  the  government,  and  submit  petitions  to 
the  emperor.  Nevertheless,  in  spite  of  these  institutional  changes, 
sovereignty  still  resided  in  the  emperor  on  the  basis  of  his  divine 
ancestry.  The  new  constitution  specified  a  form  of  government  that 
was  still  authoritarian  in  character,  with  the  emperor  holding  the 
ultimate  power  and  only  minimal  concessions  made  to  popular 
rights  and  parliamentary  mechanisms.  Party  participation  was 
recognized  as  part  of  the  political  process.  The  Meiji  Constitution 
was  to  last  as  the  fundamental  law  until  1947. 

The  first  national  election  was  held  in  1890  and  300  members 
were  elected  to  the  House  of  Representatives.  The  Jiyuto  and 
Kaishinto  parties  had  been  revived  in  anticipation  of  the  election 
and  together  won  over  half  of  the  seats.  The  House  of  Represen- 
tatives soon  became  the  arena  for  disputes  between  the  politicians 
and  the  government  bureaucracy  over  large  issues,  such  as  the  bud- 
get, the  ambiguity  of  the  constitution  on  the  Diet's  authority,  and 
the  desire  of  the  Diet  to  interpret  the  "will  of  the  emperor"  versus 
the  oligarchy's  position  that  the  cabinet  and  administration  should 
"transcend"  all  conflicting  political  forces.  The  main  leverage  the 
Diet  had  was  in  its  approval  or  disapproval  of  the  budget,  and  it 
successfully  wielded  its  authority  henceforth. 

In  the  early  years  of  constitutional  government,  the  strengths 
and  weaknesses  of  the  Meiji  Constitution  were  revealed.  A  small 
clique  of  Satsuma  and  Choshu  elite  continued  to  rule  Japan,  be- 
coming institutionalized  as  an  extraconstitutional  body  of  genro  (elder 
statesmen).  Collectively,  the  genro  made  decisions  reserved  for  the 
emperor,  and  the  genro,  not  the  emperor,  controlled  the  govern- 
ment politically.  Throughout  the  period,  however,  political  prob- 
lems were  usually  solved  through  compromise,  and  political  parties 
gradually  increased  their  power  over  the  government  and  held  an 
ever  larger  role  in  the  political  process  as  a  result.

Between  1891  and  1895,  Ito  served  as  prime  minister  with  a  cabi- 
net composed  mostly  of  genro  who  wanted  to  establish  a  govern- 
ment party  to  control  the  House  of  Representatives.  Although  not 
fully  realized,  the  trend  toward  party  politics  was  well  established. 

Modernization  and  Industrialization 

Japan  emerged  from  the  Tokugawa-Meiji  transition  as  the  first 
Asian  industrialized  nation.  Domestic  commercial  activities  and 
limited  foreign  trade  had  met  the  demands  for  material  culture  in 
the  Tokugawa  period,  but  the  modernized  Meiji  era  had  radically 
different  requirements.  From  the  onset,  the  Meiji  rulers  embraced 
the  concept  of  a  market  economy  and  adopted  British  and  North 
American  forms  of  free  enterprise  capitalism.  The  private  sector — in 
a  nation  blessed  with  an  abundance  of  aggressive  entrepeneurs — 
welcomed  such  change. 

Economic  reforms  included  a  unified  modern  currency  based 
on  the  yen,  banking,  commercial  and  tax  laws,  stock  exchanges, 
and  a  communications  network.  Establishment  of  a  modern  institu- 
tional framework  conducive  to  an  advanced  capitalist  economy  took 
time,  but  was  completed  by  the  1890s.  By  this  time,  the  govern- 
ment had  largely  relinquished  direct  control  of  the  moderniza- 
tion process,  primarily  for  budgetary  reasons.  Many  of  the  former 
daimyd,  whose  pensions  had  been  paid  in  a  lump  sum,  benefited 
greatly  through  investments  they  made  in  emerging  industries,  while

those  who  had  been  informally  involved  in  foreign  trade  before  the 
Meiji  Restoration  also  flourished.  Old  bakufu-serv'mg  firms  that 
clung  to  their  traditional  ways  failed  in  the  new  business  en- 
vironment. 

The  government  was  initially  involved  in  economic  moderniza- 
tion, providing  a  number  of  "model  factories"  to  facilitate  the  tran- 
sition to  the  modern  period.  After  the  first  twenty  years  of  the  Meiji 
period,  the  industrial  economy  expanded  rapidly  through  to  about 
1920  with  inputs  of  advanced  Western  technology  and  large  pri- 
vate investments.  Stimulated  by  wars  and  through  cautious  eco- 
nomic planning,  Japan  emerged  from  World  War  I  as  a  major 
industrial  nation. 

Overseas  Expansion 

Historically,  Japan's  main  foreign  preoccupation  has  been  China. 
The  Korean  Peninsula,  a  strategically  located  feature  critical  to 
the  defense  of  the  Japanese  archipelago,  greatly  occupied  Japan's 
attention  in  the  nineteenth  century.  Earlier  tension  over  Korea  had 
been  settled  temporarily  through  the  Treaty  of  Kanghwa  in  1876, 
which  opened  Korean  ports  to  Japan,  and  in  1885  the  Tianjin  Con- 
vention had  provided  for  the  removal  from  Korea  of  both  Chinese 
and  Japanese  troops  sent  to  support  contending  factions  in  the 
Korean  court.  In  effect,  the  convention  had  made  Korea  a  co- 
protectorate  of  Beijing  and  Tokyo  at  a  time  when  Russian,  Brit- 
ish, and  United  States  interests  in  the  peninsula  also  were  on  the 
increase.  A  crisis  was  precipitated  in  1894  when  a  leading  pro- 
Japanese  Korean  political  figure  was  assassinated  in  Shanghai  with 
Chinese  complicity.  Prowar  elements  in  Japan  called  for  a  puni- 
tive expedition,  which  the  cabinet  resisted.  With  assistance  from 
several  Japanese  nationalistic  societies,  the  illegal  Tonghak  (Eastern 
Learning)  nationalistic  religious  movement  in  Korea  staged  a  re- 
bellion that  was  crushed  by  Chinese  troops.  Japan  responded  with 
force  and  quickly  defeated  China  in  the  First  Sino-Japanese  War 
(1894-95).  After  nine  months  of  fighting,  a  cease-fire  was  called 
and  peace  talks  were  held.  The  victor's  demands  were  such  that 
a  Japanese  protectorate  over  China  seemed  in  the  offing,  but  an 
assassination  attempt  on  Li  Hongzhang,  China's  envoy  to  the  peace 
talks,  embarrassed  Japan,  which  then  quickly  agreed  to  an  ar- 
mistice. The  Treaty  of  Shimonoseki  recognized  Korean  indepen- 
dence; the  end  of  Korean  tribute  to  China;  a  200-million-tael 
(Chinese  ounces  of  silver,  the  equivalent  in  1895  of  US$150  mil- 
lion) indemnity;  the  ceding  of  Taiwan,  the  Penghu  Islands,  and 
the  Liaodong  Peninsula  (the  southern  part  of  Manchuria)  to  Japan; 
and  the  opening  of  Chang  Jiang  (Yangtze  River)  ports  to  Japanese

trade.  It  also  assured  Japanese  rights  to  engage  in  industrial  enter- 
prises in  China. 

Having  their  own  imperialist  designs  on  China  and  fearing  its 
impending  disintegration,  Russia,  Germany,  and  France  jointly 
objected  to  Japanese  control  of  Liaodong.  Threatened  with  a  tripar- 
tite naval  maneuver  in  Korean  waters,  Japan  decided  to  give  back 
Liaodong  in  return  for  a  larger  indemnity  from  China.  Russia 
moved  to  fill  the  void  by  securing  from  China  a  twenty-five-year 
lease  of  Dalian  (Dairen  in  Japanese,  also  known  as  Port  Arthur) 
and  rights  to  the  South  Manchurian  Railway  Company,  a  semi- 
official Japanese  company,  to  construct  a  railroad.  St.  Petersburg 
also  wanted  to  lease  more  Manchurian  territory,  and,  although 
Japan  was  loath  to  confront  Russia  over  this  issue,  it  did  move  to 
use  Korea  as  a  bargaining  point:  Japan  would  recognize  Russian 
leaseholds  in  southern  Manchuria  if  Russia  would  leave  Korean 
affairs  to  Japan.  The  Russians  only  agreed  not  to  impede  the  work 
of  Japanese  advisers  in  Korea,  but  Japan  was  able  to  use  diplo- 
matic initiatives  to  keep  St.  Petersburg  from  leasing  Korean  terri- 
tory in  1899.  At  the  same  time,  Japan  was  able  to  wrest  a  concession 
from  China  that  the  coastal  areas  of  Fujian  Province,  across  the 
strait  from  Taiwan,  were  within  Japan's  sphere  of  influence  and 
could  not  be  leased  to  other  powers.  In  1900  Japanese  forces  par- 
ticipated in  suppressing  the  Boxer  Uprising,  exacting  still  more  in- 
demnity from  China. 

Japan  then  succeeded  in  attracting  a  Western  ally  to  its  cause. 
Japan  and  Britain,  both  of  whom  wanted  to  keep  Russia  out  of 
Manchuria,  signed  a  Treaty  of  Alliance  in  1902,  which  was  in  ef- 
fect until  1921,  when  the  two  signed  the  Four  Power  Treaty  on 
Insular  Possessions,  which  took  effect  in  1923.  The  British  recog- 
nized Japanese  interests  in  Korea  and  assured  Japan  they  would 
remain  neutral  in  case  of  a  Russo-Japanese  war  but  would  become 
more  actively  involved  if  another  power  (probably  an  allusion  to 
France)  entered  the  war  as  a  Russian  ally.  In  the  face  of  this  joint 
threat,  Russia  became  more  conciliatory  toward  Japan  and  agreed 
to  withdraw  its  troops  from  Manchuria  in  1903.  The  new  balance 
of  power  in  Korea  favored  Japan  and  allowed  Britain  to  concen- 
trate its  interests  elsewhere  in  Asia.  Hence,  Tokyo  moved  to  gain 
influence  over  Korean  banks,  opened  its  own  financial  institutions 
in  Korea,  and  began  constructing  railroads  and  obstructing  Rus- 
sian and  French  undertakings  on  the  peninsula. 

When  Russia  failed  to  withdraw  its  troops  from  Manchuria  by 
an  appointed  date,  Tokyo  issued  a  protest.  St.  Petersburg  replied 
that  it  would  agree  to  a  partition  of  Korea  at  the  thirty-ninth  parallel, 
with  a  Japanese  sphere  to  the  south  and  a  neutral  zone  to  the  north.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

But  Manchuria  was  to  be  outside  Japan's  sphere,  and  Russia  would 
not  guarantee  the  evacuation  of  its  troops.  Despite  the  urging  of 
caution  by  most  genro,  Japan's  hardliners  issued  an  ultimatum  to 
Russia,  which  showed  no  signs  of  further  compromise.  War  broke 
out  in  February  1904  with  Japanese  surprise  attacks  on  Russian 
warships  at  Dalian  and  Chemulpo  (in  Korea,  now  called  Inch' on). 
Despite  tremendous  loss  of  life  on  both  sides,  the  Japanese  won 
a  series  of  land  battles  and  then  decisively  defeated  Russia's  Baltic 
Sea  Fleet  (renamed  the  Second  Pacific  Squadron)  at  the  Battle  of 
Tsushima  in  May  1905.  At  an  American-mediated  peace  con- 
ference in  Portsmouth,  New  Hampshire,  Russia  acknowledged 
Japan's  paramount  interests  in  Korea  and  agreed  to  avoid  *  'mili- 
tary measures"  in  Manchuria  and  Korea.  Both  sides  agreed  to 
evacuate  Manchuria,  except  for  the  Guandong  Territory,  a  lease- 
hold on  the  Liaodong  Peninsula,  and  restore  the  occupied  areas 
to  China.  Russia  transferred  its  lease  on  Dalian  and  adjacent  ter- 
ritories and  railroads  to  Japan,  ceded  the  southern  half  of  Sakhalin 
to  Japan,  and  granted  Japan  fishing  rights  in  the  Sea  of  Okhotsk 
and  the  Bering  Sea. 

Japanese  nationalism  intensified  after  the  Russo-Japanese  War 
and  a  new  phase  of  continental  expansion  began  after  1905.  Polit- 
ically and  economically,  Korea  became  a  protectorate  of  Japan  and 
in  1910  was  formally  annexed  as  a  part  of  the  empire.  By  means 
of  the  South  Manchurian  Railway,  Japanese  entrepreneurs  vig- 
orously exploited  Manchuria.  By  1907  Russia  had  entered  into  a 
treaty  arrangement  with  Japan  whereby  both  sides  recognized  the 
other's  sphere  of  influence  in  Manchuria. 

Political  Rivalries 

After  the  bitter  political  rivalries  between  the  inception  of  the 
Diet  and  1894,  when  the  nation  was  unified  for  the  war  effort  against 
China,  there  followed  five  years  of  unity,  unusual  cooperation,  and 
coalition  cabinets.  From  1900  to  1912,  the  Diet  and  the  cabinet 
cooperated  even  more  directly,  with  political  parties  playing  larger 
roles.  Throughout  the  entire  period,  the  old  Meiji  oligarchy  re- 
tained ultimate  control,  but  steadily  yielded  power  to  the  opposi- 
tion parties.  The  major  figures  of  the  period  were  Yamagata 
Aritomo,  whose  long  tenure  (1868-1922)  as  a  military  and  civil 
leader,  including  two  terms  as  prime  minister,  was  characterized 
by  his  intimidation  of  rivals  and  resistance  to  democratic  proce- 
dures; and  Ito,  who  was  a  compromiser  and,  although  overruled 
by  the  genro,  wanted  to  establish  a  government  party  to  control  the 
House  during  his  first  term.  When  Ito  returned  to  the  prime 
ministership  in  1898,  he  again  pushed  for  a  government  party,  but 


48 


Historical  Setting 


when  Yamagata  and  others  refused,  Ito  resigned.  With  no  willing 
successor  among  the  genro,  the  Kenseito  (Constitutional  Party)  was 
invited  to  form  a  cabinet  under  the  leadership  of  Okuma  and 
Itagaki,  a  major  achievement  in  the  opposition  parties'  competi- 
tion with  the  genro.  This  success  was  short-lived:  the  Kenseito  split 
into  two  parties,  the  Kenseito  led  by_ Itagaki  and  the  Kensei  Honto 
(Real  Constitutional  Party)  led  by  Okuma,  and  the  cabinet  ended 
after  only  four  months.  Yamagata  then  returned  as  prime  min- 
ister with  the  backing  of  the  military  and  the  bureaucracy.  Despite 
broad  support  of  his  views  on  limiting  constitutional  government, 
Yamagata  formed  an  alliance  with  Kenseito.  Reforms  of  electoral 
laws,  an  expansion  of  the  House  to  369  members,  and  provisions 
for  secret  ballots  won  Diet  support  for  Yamagata' s  budgets  and 
tax  increases.  He  continued  to  use  imperial  ordinances,  however, 
to  keep  the  parties  from  fully  participating  in  the  bureaucracy  and 
to  strengthen  the  already  independent  position  of  the  military.  When 
Yamagata  failed  to  offer  more  compromises  to  the  Kenseito,  the 
alliance  ended  in  1900,  beginning  a  new  phase  of  political  de- 
velopment. 

Ito  and  a  protege,  Saionji  Kimmochi  (1849-1940),  finally  suc- 
ceeded in  forming  a  progovernment  party — the  Seiyukai  (Associ- 
ation of  Friends  of  Constitutional  Government) — in  September 
1900,  and  a  month  later  Ito  became  prime  minister  of  the  first  Seiyu- 
kai cabinet.  The  Seiyukai  held  the  majority  of  seats  in  the  House, 
but  Yamagata' s  conservative  allies  had  the  greatest  influence  in 
the  House  of  Peers,  forcing  Ito  to  seek  imperial  intervention.  Tiring 
of  political  infighting,  Ito  resigned  in  1901.  Thereafter,  the  prime 
ministership  alternated  between  Yamagata' s  protege,  Katsura  Taro 
(1847-1913;  prime  minister  1901-5  and  1908-11),  and  Saionji 
(prime  minister  1905-8  and  1911-12).  The  alternating  of  political 
power  was  an  indication  of  the  two  sides'  ability  to  cooperate  and 
share  power  and  helped  foster  the  continued  development  of  party 
politics. 

The  Meiji  era  ended  with  the  death  of  the  emperor  in  1912  and 
the  accession  of  Crown  Prince  Yoshihito  as  emperor  of  the  Taisho 
period  (Great  Righteousness,  1912-26).  The  end  of  the  Meiji  era 
was  marked  by  huge  government  domestic  and  overseas  invest- 
ments and  defense  programs,  nearly  exhausted  credit,  and  a  lack 
of  foreign  exchange  to  pay  debts.  The  beginnning  of  the  Taisho 
era  was  marked  by  a  political  crisis  that  interrupted  the  earlier 
politics  of  compromise.  When  Saionji  tried  to  cut  the  military  bud- 
get, the  army  minister  resigned,  bringing  down  the  Seiyukai  cabi- 
net. Both  Yamagata  and  Saionji  refused  to  resume  office  and  the 
genro  were  unable  to  find  a  solution.  Public  outrage  over  the  military 


49

manipulation  of  the  cabinet  and  the  recall  of  Katsura  for  a  third 
term  led  to  still  more  demands  for  an  end  to  genro  politics.  Despite 
old  guard  opposition,  the  conservative  forces  formed  a  party  of  their 
own  in  1913,  the  Rikken  Doshikai  (Constitutional  Association  of 
Friends),  a  party  that  won  a  majority  in  the  House  over  the  Seiyukai 
in  late  1914. 

World  War  I 

Seizing  the  opportunity  of  Berlin's  distraction  with  the  Europe- 
an War,  and  wanting  to  expand  its  sphere  of  influence  in  China, 
Japan  declared  war  on  Germany  in  August  1914  and  quickly  oc- 
cupied German-leased  territories  in  China's  Shandong  Province 
and  the  Mariana,  Caroline,  and  Marshall  islands  in  the  Pacific. 
With  its  Western  allies  heavily  involved  in  the  war  in  Europe,  Japan 
sought  further  to  consolidate  its  position  in  China  by  presenting 
the  Twenty-One  Demands  to  China  in  January  1915.  Besides  ex- 
panding its  control  over  the  German  holdings,  Manchuria,  and 
Inner  Mongolia,  Japan  also  sought  joint  ownership  of  a  major  min- 
ing and  metallurgical  complex  in  central  China,  prohibitions  on 
China's  ceding  or  leasing  any  coastal  areas  to  a  third  power,  and 
miscellaneous  other  political,  economic,  and  military  controls,  which 
if  achieved,  would  have  reduced  China  to  a  Japanese  protectorate. 
In  the  face  of  slow  negotiations  with  the  Chinese  government, 
widespread  anti-Japanese  sentiments  in  China,  and  international 
condemnation,  Japan  withdrew  the  final  group  of  demands,  and 
treaties  were  signed  in  May  1915. 

Japan's  hegemony  in  northern  China  and  other  parts  of  Asia 
was  facilitated  through  other  international  agreements.  One  with 
Russia  in  1916  helped  further  secure  Japan's  influence  in  Man- 
churia and  Inner  Mongolia,  and  agreements  with  France,  Britain, 
and  the  United  States  in  1917  recognized  Japan's  territorial  gains 
in  China  and  the  Pacific.  The  Nishihara  Loans  (named  after  Nishi- 
hara  Kamezo,  Tokyo's  representative  in  Beijing)  of  1917  and  1918, 
while  aiding  the  Chinese  government,  put  it  still  deeper  into  Japan's 
debt.  Toward  the  end  of  the  war,  Japan  increasingly  filled  orders 
for  its  European  allies'  needed  war  materiel,  thus  helping  to  diversify 
the  country's  industry,  increase  its  exports,  and  transform  Japan 
from  a  debtor  to  a  creditor  nation  for  the  first  time. 

Japan's  power  in  Asia  grew  with  the  demise  of  the  tsarist  re- 
gime in  Russia  and  the  disorder  the  1917  Bolshevik  Revolution 
left  in  Siberia.  Wanting  to  seize  the  opportunity,  the  Japanese  army 
planned  to  occupy  Siberia  as  far  west  as  Lake  Baykal.  To  do  so, 
Japan  had  to  negotiate  an  agreement  with  China  allowing  the  transit 
of  Japanese  troops  through  Chinese  territory.  Although  the  force

was  scaled  back  to  avoid  antagonizing  the  United  States,  more  than 
70,000  Japanese  troops  joined  the  much  smaller  units  of  the  Al- 
lied Expeditionary  Force  sent  to  Siberia  in  1918. 

The  year  1919  saw  Japan  sitting  among  the  '  'Big  Five"  powers 
at  the  Versailles  Peace  Conference.  Tokyo  was  granted  a  perma- 
nent seat  on  the  Council  of  the  League  of  Nations,  and  the  peace 
treaty  confirmed  the  transfer  to  Japan  of  Germany's  rights  in  Shan- 
dong, a  provision  that  led  to  anti-Japanese  riots  and  a  mass  politi- 
cal movement  throughout  China.  Similarly,  Germany's  former 
Pacific  islands  were  put  under  a  Japanese  mandate.  Despite  its  small 
role  in  World  War  I  (and  the  Western  powers'  rejection  of  its  bid 
for  a  racial  equality  clause  in  the  peace  treaty),  Japan  emerged  as 
a  major  actor  in  international  politics  at  its  close. 

Between  the  Wars,  1920-36 
Two-Party  System 

The  two-party  political  system  that  had  been  developing  in  Japan 
since  the  turn  of  the  century  finally  came  of  age  after  World  War 
I.  This  period  has  sometimes  been  called  that  of  "Taisho  democ- 
racy," after  the  reign  title  of  the  emperor.  In  1918  Hara  Takashi 
(1856-1921),  a  protege  of  Saionji  and  a  major  influence  in  the 
prewar  Seiyukai  cabinets,  had  become  the  first  commoner  to  serve 
as  prime  minister.  He  took  advantage  of  long-standing  relation- 
ships he  had  throughout  the  government,  won  the  support  of  the 
surviving  genrd  and  the  House  of  Peers,  and  brought  into  his  cabi- 
net as  army  minister  Tanaka  Giichi  (1864-1929),  who  had  a  greater 
appreciation  of  favorable  civil-military  relations  than  his  predeces- 
sors. Nevertheless,  major  problems  confronted  Hara:  inflation,  the 
need  to  adjust  the  Japanese  economy  to  postwar  circumstances, 
the  influx  of  foreign  ideas,  and  an  emerging  labor  movement. 
Prewar  solutions  were  applied  by  the  cabinet  to  these  postwar 
problems,  and  little  was  done  to  reform  the  government.  Hara 
worked  to  ensure  a  Seiyukai  majority  through  time-tested  methods, 
such  as  new  election  laws  and  electoral  redistricting,  and  embarked 
on  major  government-funded  public  works  programs. 

The  public  grew  disillusioned  with  the  growing  national  debt 
and  the  new  election  laws,  which  retained  the  old  minimum  tax 
qualifications  for  voters.  Calls  were  raised  for  universal  suffrage 
and  the  dismantling  of  the  old  political  party  network.  Students, 
university  professors,  and  journalists,  bolstered  by  labor  unions 
and  inspired  by  a  variety  of  democratic,  socialist,  communist,  anar- 
chist, and  other  Western  schools  of  thought,  mounted  large  but 
orderly  public  demonstrations  in  favor  of  universal  male  suffrage 


51

in  1919  and  1920.  New  elections  brought  still  another  Seiyukai 
majority,  but  barely  so.  In  the  political  milieu  of  the  day,  there 
was  a  proliferation  of  new  parties,  including  socialist  and  communist 
parties. 

In  the  midst  of  this  political  ferment,  Hara  was  assassinated  by 
a  disenchanted  railroad  worker  in  1921  (see  Diplomacy,  this  ch.). 
He  was  followed  by  a  succession  of  nonparty  prime  ministers  and 
coalition  cabinets.  Fear  of  a  broader  electorate,  left-wing  power, 
and  the  growing  social  change  engendered  by  the  influx  of  Western 
popular  culture  together  led  to  the  passage  of  the  Peace  Preserva- 
tion Law  (1925),  which  forbade  any  change  in  the  political  struc- 
ture or  the  abolition  of  private  property. 

Unstable  coalitions  and  divisiveness  in  the  Diet  led  the  Kenseikai 
(Constitutional  Government  Association)  and  the  Seiyu  Honto 
(True  Seiyukai)  to  merge  as  the  Rikken  Minseito  (Constitutional 
Democratic  Party)  in  1927.  The  Minseito  platform  was  commit- 
ted to  the  parliamentary  system,  democratic  politics,  and  world 
peace.  Thereafter,  until  1932,  the  Seiyukai  and  the  Rikken  Minseito 
alternated  in  power. 

Despite  the  political  realignments  and  hope  for  more  orderly 
government,  domestic  economic  crises  plagued  whichever  party 
held  power.  Fiscal  austerity  programs  and  appeals  for  public  sup- 
port of  conservative  government  policies  like  the  Peace  Preserva- 
tion Law — including  reminders  of  the  moral  obligation  to  make 
sacrifices  for  the  emperor  and  the  state — were  attempted  as  solu- 
tions. Although  the  world  depression  of  the  late  1920s  and  early 
1930s  had  minimal  effects  on  Japan — indeed  Japanese  exports  grew 
substantially  during  this  period — there  was  a  sense  of  rising  dis- 
content that  was  heightened  with  the  assassination  of  Minseito  prime 
minister  Hamaguchi  Osachi  in  1931, 

The  events  flowing  from  the  Meiji  Restoration  in  1868  had  seen 
not  only  the  fulfillment  of  many  domestic  and  foreign  economic 
and  political  objectives — without  Japan's  first  suffering  the  colonial 
fate  of  other  Asian  nations — but  also  a  new  intellectual  ferment, 
in  a  time  when  there  was  interest  worldwide  in  socialism  and  an 
urban  proletariat  was  developing.  Universal  male  suffrage,  social 
welfare,  workers'  rights,  and  nonviolent  protest  were  ideals  of  the 
early  leftist  movement.  Government  suppression  of  leftist  activi- 
ties, however,  led  to  more  radical  leftist  action  and  even  more  sup- 
pression, resulting  in  the  dissolution  of  the  Japan  Socialist  Party 
(Nihon  Shakaito),  only  a  year  after  its  1906  founding,  and  in  the 
general  failure  of  the  socialist  movement. 

The  victory  of  the  communists  in  Russia  in  1917  and  their  hopes 
for  a  world  revolution  led  to  the  establishment  of  the  Comintern 


52 


Historical  Setting 


(a  contraction  of  Communist  International,  the  organization  founded 
in  Moscow  in  1919  to  coordinate  the  world  communist  movement). 
The  Comintern  realized  the  importance  of  Japan  in  achieving  suc- 
cessful revolution  in  East  Asia  and  actively  worked  to  form  the  Japan 
Communist  Party  (Nihon  Kyosanto),  which  was  founded  in  July 
1922.  An  end  to  feudalism,  the  abolition  of  the  monarchy,  with- 
drawal of  Japanese  troops  from  Siberia,  Sakhalin,  China,  Korea, 
and  Taiwan,  and  recognition  of  the  Soviet  Union  were  the  an- 
nounced goals  of  the  Japan  Communist  Party  in  1923.  A  brutal 
suppression  of  the  party  followed.  Radicals  responded  with  an  as- 
sassination attempt  on  Prince  Regent  Hirohito.  The  1925  Peace 
Preservation  Law  was  a  direct  response  to  the  "dangerous  thoughts" 
perpetrated  by  communist  elements  in  Japan. 

The  liberalization  of  election  laws,  also  in  1925,  benefited  com- 
munist candidates  even  though  the  Japan  Communist  Party  itself 
was  banned.  A  new  Peace  Preservation  Law  in  1928,  however, 
further  impeded  communist  efforts  by  banning  the  parties  they  had 
infiltrated.  The  police  apparatus  of  the  day  was  ubiquitous  and 
quite  thorough  in  attempting  to  control  the  socialist  movement  (see 
The  Police  System,  ch.  8).  By  1926  the  Japan  Communist  Party 
had  been  forced  underground,  by  the  summer  of  1929  the  party 
leadership  had  been  virtually  destroyed,  and  by  1933  the  party  had 
largely  disintegrated. 

Diplomacy 

Emerging  Chinese  nationalism,  the  victory  of  the  communists 
in  Russia,  and  the  growing  presence  of  the  United  States  in  East 
Asia  all  worked  against  Japan's  postwar  foreign  policy  interests. 
The  four-year  Siberian  expedition  and  activities  in  China,  com- 
bined with  big  domestic  spending  programs,  had  depleted  Japan's 
wartime  earnings.  Only  through  more  competitive  business  prac- 
tices, supported  by  further  economic  development  and  industrial 
modernization,  all  accommodated  by  the  growth  of  the  zaibatsu 
(wealth  groups — see  Glossary),  could  Japan  hope  to  become  pre- 
dominant in  Asia.  The  United  States,  long  a  source  of  many  im- 
ported goods  and  loans  needed  for  development,  was  seen  as 
becoming  a  major  impediment  to  this  goal  because  of  its  policies 
of  containing  Japanese  imperialism. 

An  international  turning  point  in  military  diplomacy  was  the 
Washington  Conference  of  1921-22,  which  produced  a  series  of 
agreements  that  effected  a  new  order  in  the  Pacific  region.  Japan's 
economic  problems  made  a  naval  buildup  nearly  impossible  and, 
realizing  the  need  to  compete  with  the  United  States  on  an  eco- 
nomic rather  than  a  military  basis,  the  Japanese  government  came 


53 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


to  see  rapprochement  as  inevitable.  Japan  adopted  a  more  neutral 
attitude  toward  the  civil  war  in  China;  joined  the  United  States, 
Britain,  and  France  in  encouraging  Chinese  self-development;  and 
dropped  efforts  to  expand  its  hegemony  into  China  proper. 

In  the  Four  Power  Treaty  on  Insular  Possessions  (December  13, 
1921),  Japan,  the  United  States,  Britain,  and  France  agreed  to 
recognize  the  status  quo  in  the  Pacific,  and  Japan  and  Britain  agreed 
to  terminate  formally  their  Treaty  of  Alliance.  The  Five  Power 
Naval  Disarmament  Treaty  (February  6,  1922)  established  an  in- 
ternational capital  ship  ratio  (5,  5,  3,  1.75,  and  1.75,  respectively, 
for  the  United  States,  Britain,  Japan,  France,  and  Italy)  and  limited 
the  size  and  armaments  of  capital  ships  already  built  or  under  con- 
struction. In  a  move  that  gave  the  Japanese  Imperial  Navy  greater 
freedom  in  the  Pacific,  Washington  and  London  agreed  not  to  build 
any  new  military  bases  between  Singapore  and  Hawaii. 

The  goal  of  the  Nine  Power  Treaty  (February  6,  1922),  signed 
by  Belgium,  China,  the  Netherlands,  and  Portugal  along  with  the 
original  five  powers,  was  the  prevention  of  war  in  the  Pacific.  The 
signatories  agreed  to  respect  China's  independence  and  integrity, 
not  to  interfere  in  Chinese  attempts  to  establish  a  stable  govern- 
ment, to  refrain  from  seeking  special  privileges  in  China  or  threaten- 
ing the  positions  of  other  nations  there,  to  support  a  policy  of  equal 
opportunity  for  commerce  and  industry  of  all  nations  in  China, 
and  to  reexamine  extraterritoriality  and  tariff  autonomy  policies. 
Japan  also  agreed  to  withdraw  its  troops  from  Shandong,  relin- 
quishing all  but  purely  economic  rights  there,  and  to  evacuate  its 
troops  from  Siberia. 

In  1928  Japan  joined  fourteen  other  nations  in  signing  the 
Kellogg-Briand  Pact,  which  denounced  "recourse  to  war  for  the 
solution  of  international  controversies."  Thus,  when  Japan  invaded 
Manchuria  only  three  years  later,  its  pretext  was  the  defense  of 
its  nationals  and  economic  interests  there.  The  London  Naval  Con- 
ference in  1930  came  at  the  time  of  an  economic  recession  in  Japan, 
and  the  Japanese  government  was  amenable  to  further,  cost-saving 
naval  reductions.  Although  Prime  Minister  Hamaguchi  Osachi 
(1870-1931)  had  civilian  support,  he  bypassed  the  Naval  General 
Staff  and  approved  the  signing  of  the  London  Naval  Treaty. 
Hamaguchi 's  success  was  pyrrhic:  ultranationalists  called  the  treaty 
a  national  surrender,  and  navy  and  army  officials  girded  them- 
selves for  defense  of  their  budgets.  Hamaguchi  himself  died  from 
wounds  suffered  in  an  assassination  attempt  in  November  1930, 
and  the  treaty,  with  its  complex  formula  for  ship  tonnage  and  num- 
bers aimed  at  restricting  the  naval  arms  race,  had  loopholes  that 
made  it  ineffective  by  1938.

Historical  Setting 


The  Rise  of  the  Militarists 

Ultranationalism  had  characterized  right-wing  politicians  and 
conservative  military  men  since  the  inception  of  the  Meiji  Resto- 
ration, contributing  greatly  to  the  prowar  politics  of  the  1870s.  Dis- 
enchanted former  samurai  had  formed  patriotic  societies  and 
intelligence-gathering  organizations,  such  as  the  Gen'yosha  (Black 
Ocean  Society,  founded  in  1881)  and  its  later  offshoot,  the  Kokuryu- 
kai  (Black  Dragon  Society,  or  Amur  River  Society,  founded  in 
1901).  These  groups  became  active  in  domestic  and  foreign  poli- 
tics, helped  foment  prowar  sentiments,  and  supported  ultranation- 
alist  causes  through  the  end  of  World  War  II.  After  Japan's  victories 
over  China  and  Russia,  the  ultranationalists  concentrated  on  domes- 
tic issues  and  perceived  domestic  threats,  such  as  socialism  and  com- 
munism. 

After  World  War  I  and  the  intellectual  ferment  of  the  period, 
nationalist  societies  became  numerous  but  had  a  minority  voice 
during  the  era  of  two-party  democratic  politics.  Diverse  and  angry 
groups  called  for  nationalization  of  all  wealth  above  a  fixed  minimal 
amount  and  for  armed  overseas  expansion.  The  emperor  was  highly 
revered  by  these  groups,  and  when  Hirohito  was  enthroned  in  1927 
initiating  the  Showa  period  (Bright  Harmony,  1926-89),  there  were 
calls  for  a  "Showa  Restoration"  and  a  revival  of  Shinto.  Emperor- 
centered  neo-Shintoism,  or  State  Shinto,  which  had  long  been  de- 
veloping, came  to  fruition  in  the  1930s  and  1940s.  It  glorified  the 
emperor  and  traditional  Japanese  virtues  to  the  exclusion  of  the 
Western  influences  perceived  as  greedy,  individualistic,  bourgeois, 
and  assertive.  The  ideals  of  the  Japanese  family-state  and  self- 
sacrifice  in  service  of  the  nation  were  given  a  missionary  interpre- 
tation, being  thought  by  their  ultranationalist  proponents  to  be  ap- 
plicable to  the  modern  world. 

The  1930s  were  a  decade  of  fear  in  Japan,  characterized  by  the 
resurgence  of  right-wing  patriotism,  the  weakening  of  democratic 
forces,  domestic  terrorist  violence  (including  an  assassination  at- 
tempt on  the  emperor  in  1932),  and  stepped-up  military  aggres- 
sion abroad.  A  prelude  to  this  state  of  affairs  was  Tanaka  Giichi's 
term  as  prime  minister  from  1927  to  1929.  Twice  he  sent  troops 
to  China  to  obstruct  Chiang  Kai-shek's  unification  campaign,  and, 
in  June  1928,  adventurous  officers  of  the  Guandong  Army,  the 
Imperial  Japanese  Army  unit  stationed  in  Manchuria,  embarked 
on  unauthorized  initiatives  to  protect  Japanese  interests,  includ- 
ing the  assassination  of  a  former  ally,  Manchurian  warlord  Zhang 
Zuolin.  The  perpetrators  hoped  the  Chinese  would  be  prompted 
to  take  military  action,  forcing  the  Guandong  Army  to  retaliate. 


55 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

The  Japanese  high  command  and  the  Chinese,  however,  both  re- 
fused to  mobilize.  The  incident  turned  out  to  be  a  striking  exam- 
ple of  unchecked  terrorism.  Even  though  press  censorship  kept  the 
Japanese  public  from  knowing  about  these  events,  they  led  to  the 
downfall  of  Tanaka  and  set  the  stage  for  a  similar  plot,  the  Man- 
churian  Incident,  in  1931. 

A  secret  society  founded  by  army  officers  seeking  to  establish 
a  military  dictatorship — the  Sakurakai  (Cherry  Society,  the  cherry 
blossom  being  emblematic  of  self-sacrifice) — plotted  to  attack  the 
Diet  and  political  party  headquarters,  assassinate  the  prime 
minister,  and  declare  martial  law  under  a  "Showa  Restoration" 
government  led  by  the  army  minister.  Although  the  army  cancelled 
its  coup  plans  (to  have  been  carried  out  in  March  1931),  no  reprisals 
were  taken  and  terrorist  activity  was  again  tacitly  condoned. 

The  Manchurian  Incident  of  September  1931  did  not  fail  and 
it  set  the  stage  for  the  eventual  military  takeover  of  the  Japanese 
government.  Guandong  Army  conspirators  blew  up  a  few  meters 
of  South  Manchurian  Railway  Company  track  near  Mukden  (now 
Shenyang),  blamed  it  on  Chinese  saboteurs,  and  used  the  event 
as  an  excuse  to  seize  Mukden.  One  month  later,  in  Tokyo,  mili- 
tary figures  plotted  the  October  Incident,  which  was  aimed  at  set- 
ting up  a  national  socialist  state.  The  plot  failed,  but  again  the  news 
was  suppressed  and  the  military  perpetrators  were  not  punished. 
Japanese  forces  attacked  Shanghai  in  January  1932  on  the  pretext 
of  Chinese  resistance  in  Manchuria.  Finding  stiff  Chinese  resistance 
in  Shanghai,  the  Japanese  waged  a  three-month  undeclared  war 
there  before  a  truce  was  reached  in  March  1932.  Several  days  later, 
Manchukuo  was  established.  Manchukuo  was  a  Japanese  puppet 
state  headed  by  the  last  Chinese  emperor,  Puyi,  as  chief  executive 
and  later  emperor.  The  civilian  government  in  Tokyo  was  power- 
less to  prevent  these  military  happenings.  Instead  of  being  con- 
demned, the  Guandong  Army's  actions  enjoyed  popular  support 
back  home.  International  reactions  were  extremely  negative, 
however.  Japan  withdrew  from  the  League  of  Nations,  and  the 
United  States  became  increasingly  hostile. 

The  Japanese  system  of  party  government  finally  met  its  demise 
with  the  May  15th  Incident  in  1932,  when  a  group  of  junior  naval 
officers  and  army  cadets  assassinated  Prime  Minister  Inukai  Tsuyoshi 
(1855-1932).  Although  the  assassins  were  put  on  trial  and  sentenced 
to  fifteen  years'  imprisonment,  they  were  seen  popularly  as  having 
acted  out  of  patriotism.  Inukai 's  successors,  military  men  chosen 
by  Saionji,  the  last  surviving  genro,  recognized  Manchukuo  and 
generally  approved  the  army's  actions  in  securing  Manchuria  as  an 
industrial  base,  an  area  for  Japanese  emigration,  and  a  staging

ground  for  war  with  the  Soviet  Union.  Various  army  factions  con- 
tended for  power  amid  increasing  suppression  of  dissent  and  more 
assassinations.  In  the  February  26th  Incident  of  1936,  about  1,500 
troops  went  on  a  rampage  of  assassination  against  the  current  and 
former  prime  ministers  and  other  cabinet  members,  and  even 
Saionji  and  members  of  the  imperial  court.  The  revolt  was  put  down 
by  other  military  units  and  its  leaders  executed  after  secret  trials. 
Despite  public  dismay  over  these  events  and  the  discredit  they 
brought  to  numerous  military  figures,  Japan's  civilian  leadership 
capitulated  to  the  army's  demands  in  the  hope  of  ending  domestic 
violence.  Increases  were  seen  in  defense  budgets,  naval  construc- 
tion (Japan  announced  it  would  no  longer  accede  to  the  London 
Naval  Treaty),  and  patriotic  indoctrination  as  Japan  moved  toward 
a  wartime  footing. 

In  November  1936,  the  Anti-Comintern  Pact,  an  agreement  to 
exchange  information  and  collaborate  in  preventing  communist  ac- 
tivities, was  signed  by  Japan  and  Germany  (Italy  joined  a  year 
later).  War  was  launched  against  China  after  the  Marco  Polo  Bridge 
Incident  of  July  7,  1937,  in  which  an  allegedly  unplanned  clash 
took  place  near  Beiping  (as  Beijing  was  then  called)  between  Chinese 
and  Japanese  troops  and  quickly  escalated  into  full-scale  warfare. 
The  Second  Sino-Japanese  War  (1937-45)  ensued,  and  relations 
with  the  United  States,  Britain,  and  the  Soviet  Union  deteriorated. 
The  increased  military  activities  in  China — and  Japan's  idea  of 
establishing  "Mengukuo"  in  Inner  Mongolia  and  the  Mongolian 
People's  Republic — soon  led  to  a  major  clash  over  rival  Mongolia- 
Manchukuo  border  claims.  When  Japanese  troops  invaded  eastern 
Mongolia,  a  major  ground  and  air  battle  with  a  joint  Soviet- 
Mongolian  army  took  place  between  May  and  September  1939  at 
the  Battle  of  Halhin  Gol.  The  Japanese  were  severely  defeated, 
sustaining  as  many  as  80,000  casualties,  and  thereafter  Japan  con- 
centrated its  war  efforts  on  its  southward  drive  in  China  and 
Southeast  Asia,  a  strategy  that  helped  propel  Japan  ever  closer  to 
war  with  the  United  States,  Britain,  and  their  allies. 

Under  the  prime  ministership  of  Konoe  Fumimaro  (1891- 
1945) — the  last  head  of  the  famous  Fujiwara  house — the  govern- 
ment was  streamlined  and  given  absolute  power  over  the  nation's 
assets.  In  1940,  the  2,600th  anniversary  of  the  founding  of  Japan 
according  to  tradition,  Konoe 's  cabinet  called  for  the  establishment 
of  a  *  'Greater  East  Asia  Coprosperity  Sphere,"  a  concept  build- 
ing on  Konoe 's  1938  call  for  a  "New  Order  in  Greater  East  Asia," 
encompassing  Japan,  Manchukuo,  China,  and  Southeast  Asia.  The 
Greater  East  Asia  Coprosperity  Sphere  was  to  integrate  Asia  po- 
litically and  economically — under  Japanese  leadership — against

Western  domination.  It  was  developed  in  recognition  of  the  chang- 
ing geopolitical  situation  emerging  in  1940,  and,  eventually,  a 
Greater  East  Asia  Ministry  was  established  (in  1942)  and  the 
Greater  East  Asia  Conference  was  held  in  Tokyo  in  1943.  Also 
in  1940,  political  parties  were  ordered  to  dissolve,  and  the  Imperial 
Rule  Assistance  Association,  comprising  members  of  all  former  par- 
ties, was  established  to  transmit  government  orders  throughout 
society.  In  September  1940,  Japan  joined  the  Axis  alliance  with 
Germany  and  Italy  when  it  signed  the  Tripartite  Pact,  a  military 
agreement  to  redivide  the  world  that  was  directed  primarily  against 
the  United  States. 

There  had  been  a  long-standing  and  deep-seated  antagonism  be- 
tween Japan  and  the  United  States  since  the  first  decade  of  the  twen- 
tieth century.  Each  perceived  the  other  as  a  military  threat,  and 
trade  rivalry  was  carried  on  in  earnest.  The  Japanese  greatly  re- 
sented the  racial  discrimination  perpetuated  by  United  States  im- 
migration laws,  and  the  Americans  became  increasingly  wary  of 
Japan's  interference  in  the  self-determination  of  other  peoples. 
Japan's  military  expansionism  and  quest  for  national  self-sufficiency 
eventually  led  the  United  States  in  1940  to  embargo  war  supplies, 
abrogate  a  long-standing  commercial  treaty,  and  put  greater  re- 
strictions on  the  export  of  critical  commodities.  These  American 
tactics,  rather  than  forcing  Japan  to  a  standstill,  made  Japan  more 
desperate.  After  the  signing  of  the  Japanese-Soviet  Neutrality  Pact 
in  April  1941,  and  while  still  actively  making  war  plans  against 
the  United  States,  Japan  participated  in  diplomatic  negotiations 
with  Washington  aimed  at  achieving  a  peaceful  settlement.  Wash- 
ington was  quite  concerned  about  Japan's  role  in  the  Tripartite 
Pact  and  demanded  the  withdrawal  of  Japanese  troops  from  China 
and  Southeast  Asia.  Japan  countered  that  it  would  not  use  force 
unless  "a  country  not  yet  involved  in  the  European  war"  (that  is, 
the  United  States)  attacked  Germany  or  Italy,  and  demanded  that 
the  United  States  and  Britain  not  interfere  with  a  Japanese  settle- 
ment in  China  (a  pro-Japanese  puppet  government  had  been  set 
up  in  Nanjing  in  1940).  Because  certain  Japanese  military  leaders 
were  working  at  cross-purposes  with  officials  seeking  a  peaceful  set- 
tlement (including  Konoe,  other  civilians,  and  some  military 
figures),  talks  were  deadlocked.  On  October  15,  1941,  army  min- 
ister Tqjo  Hideki  (1884-1948)  declared  the  negotiations  ended. 
Konoe  resigned,  replaced  by  Tqjo,  and  after  one  final  United  States 
rejection  of  Japan's  terms  of  negotiation,  on  December  1,  1941, 
the  Imperial  Conference  (an  ad  hoc  meeting  convened — and  then 
rarely — in  the  presence  of  the  emperor)  ratified  the  decision  to

embark  on  a  war  of  "self-defense  and  self-preservation"  and  to 
attack  the  United  States  naval  base  at  Pearl  Harbor. 

World  War  II  and  the  Occupation,  1941-52 

After  initial  battlefield  success  and  a  tremendous  overextension 
of  its  resources  in  the  war  (known  to  Japan  as  the  Greater  East 
Asia  War,  to  the  United  States  as  the  Pacific  War)  against  a  quickly 
mobilizing  United  States  and  Allied  war  effort,  Japan  was  unable 
to  sustain  "Greater  East  Asia"  (see  fig.  2).  As  early  as  1943,  Konoe 
led  a  peace  movement,  and  Tqjo  was  forced  from  office  in  July 
1944.  His  successors  sought  peace  mediation  (Sweden  and  the  Soviet 
Union  were  approached  for  help  in  such  a  process),  but  the  enemy 
offered  only  unconditional  surrender.  After  the  detonation  of  atomic 
bombs  over  Hiroshima  and  Nagasaki  on  August  6  and  8,  1941, 
respectively,  the  emperor  asked  that  the  Japanese  people  bring  peace 
to  Japan  by  "enduring  the  unendurable  and  suffering  what  is  in- 
sufferable" by  surrendering  to  the  Allied  powers.  The  documents 
of  surrender  were  signed  on  board  the  U.S.S.  Missouri  in  Tokyo 
Bay,  on  September  2,  1945  (see  World  War  II,  ch.  8).  The  terms 
of  surrender  included  the  occupation  of  Japan  by  Allied  military 
forces,  assurances  that  Japan  would  never  again  go  to  war,  re- 
striction of  Japanese  sovereignty  to  the  four  main  islands  "and  such 
minor  islands  as  may  be  determined,"  and  surrender  of  Japan's 
colonial  holdings. 

A  period  of  demilitarization  and  democratization  followed  in 
Japan  (1945-47).  Under  the  direction  of  General  Douglas  Mac- 
Arthur,  the  Supreme  Commander  for  the  Allied  Powers  (SCAP), 
Japan's  army  and  navy  ministries  were  abolished,  munitions  and 
military  equipment  were  destroyed,  and  war  industries  were  con- 
verted to  civilian  uses.  War  crimes  trials  found  4,200  Japanese  offi- 
cials guilty;  700  were  executed,  and  186,000  other  public  figures 
were  purged.  State  Shinto  was  disestablished,  and  on  January  1, 
1946,  Emperor  Hirohito  repudiated  his  divinity.  MacArthur  pushed 
the  government  to  amend  the  1889  Meiji  Constitution,  and  on 
May  3,  1947,  the  new  Japanese  Constitution  (often  called  the 
"MacArthur  Constitution")  came  into  force  (see  The  Postwar  Con- 
stitution, ch.  6).  Constitutional  reforms  were  accompanied  by  eco- 
nomic reforms,  including  agricultural  land  redistribution,  the 
reestablishment  of  trade  unions,  and  severe  proscriptions  on  zaibatsu 
(see  Patterns  of  Development,  ch.  4). 

Relatively  rapid  stabilization  of  Japan  led  to  a  relaxation  of  SCAP 
purges  and  press  censorship.  Quick  economic  recovery  was  en-, 
couraged,  restrictions  on  former  zaibatsu  members  eventually  were 
lifted,  and  foreign  trade  was  allowed.  Finally,  fifty-one  nations  met

in  San  Francisco  in  September  1951  to  reach  a  peace  accord  with 
Japan  (formally  known  as  the  Treaty  of  Peace  with  Japan;  China, 
India,  and  the  Soviet  Union  participated  in  the  conference  but  did 
not  sign  the  treaty).  Japan  renounced  its  claims  to  Korea,  Taiwan, 
Penghu,  the  Kuril  Islands,  southern  Sakhalin,  islands  it  gained  by 
League  of  Nations  mandate,  South  China  Sea  islands,  and  Ant- 
arctic territory,  while  agreeing  to  settle  disputes  peacefully  according 
to  the  United  Nations  Charter.  Japan's  rights  to  defend  itself  and 
to  enter  into  collective  security  arrangements  were  acknowledged. 
The  1952  ratification  of  the  Japan-United  States  Mutual  Security 
Assistance  Pact  also  ensured  a  strong  defense  for  Japan  and  a  large 
postwar  role  in  Asia  for  the  United  States  (see  Relations  with  the 
United  States,  ch.  7;  Early  Developments,  ch.  8). 

Toward  a  New  Century,  1953-84 

Political  parties  had  begun  to  revive  almost  immediately  after 
the  occupation  began.  Left-wing  organizations,  such  as  the  Japan 
Socialist  Party  and  the  Japan  Communist  Party  quickly  reestab- 
lished themselves,  as  did  various  conservative  parties.  The  old 
Seiyiikai  and  Rikken  Minseito  came  back  as,  respectively,  the 
Liberal  Party  (Nihon  Jiyuto)  and  the  Japan  Progressive  Party 
(Nihon  Shimpoto).  The  first  postwar  elections  were  held  in  1946 
(women  were  given  the  franchise  for  the  first  time),  and  the  Liberal 
Party's  vice  president,  Yoshida  Shigeru  (1878-1967),  became  prime 
minister.  For  the  1947  elections,  anti-Yoshida  forces  left  the  Liberal 
Party  and  joined  forces  with  the  Progressive  Party  to  establish  the 
new  Democratic  Party  (Minshuto).  This  divisiveness  in  conserva- 
tive ranks  gave  a  plurality  to  the  Japan  Socialist  Party,  which  was 
allowed  to  form  a  cabinet  that  lasted  less  than  a  year.  Thereafter 
the  socialist  party  steadily  declined  in  its  electoral  successes.  After 
a  short  period  of  Democratic  Party  administration,  Yoshida  re- 
turned in  late  1948  and  continued  to  serve  as  prime  minister  until 
1954. 

Even  before  Japan  regained  full  sovereignty,  the  government 
had  rehabilitated  nearly  80,000  people  who  had  been  purged,  many 
of  whom  returned  to  their  former  political  and  government  posi- 
tions. A  debate  over  limitations  on  military  spending  and  the 
sovereignty  of  the  emperor  ensued,  contributing  to  the  great  reduc- 
tion in  the  Liberal  Party's  majority  in  the  first  postoccupation  elec- 
tions (October  1952).  After  several  reorganizations  of  the  armed 
forces,  in  1954  the  Self-Defense  Forces  were  established  under  a 
civilian  director  (see  The  Self-Defense  Forces,  ch.  8).  Cold  War 
realities  and  the  hot  war  in  nearby  Korea  also  contributed  signifi- 
cantly to  the  United  States-influenced  economic  redevelopment,

(Jiyuto)  with  the  Japan  Democratic  Party  (Nihon  Minshuto),  an 
offshoot  of  the  earlier  Democratic  Party,  to  form  the  Liberal 
Democratic  Party  (Jiyo-Minshuto;  LDP)  in  November  1955.  This 
party  has  continuously  held  power  from  1955  through  1990  (see 


63 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


The  Liberal  Democratic  Party,  ch.  6).  Its  leadership  was  drawn 
from  the  elite  who  had  seen  Japan  through  the  defeat  and  occupa- 
tion; it  attracted  former  bureaucrats,  local  politicians,  business- 
men, journalists,  other  professionals,  farmers,  and  university 
graduates.  In  October  1955,  socialist  groups  reunited  under  the 
Japan  Socialist  Party,  which  emerged  as  the  second  most  power- 
ful political  force.  It  was  followed  closely  in  popularity  by  the 
Komeito  (Clean  Government  Party),  founded  in  1964  as  the  po- 
litical arm  of  the  Soka  Gakkai  (Value  Creation  Society),  a  lay  or- 
ganization of  the  Buddhist  sect  Nichiren  Shoshu  (see  Komeito, 
ch.  6).  The  Komeito  emphasized  traditional  Japanese  beliefs  and 
attracted  urban  laborers,  former  rural  residents,  and  many  women. 
Like  the  Japan  Socialist  Party,  it  favored  the  gradual  modification 
and  dissolution  of  the  Japan-United  States  Mutual  Security  As- 
sistance Pact. 

Japan's  biggest  postwar  political  crisis  took  place  in  1960  over 
the  revision  of  this  pact.  As  the  new  Treaty  of  Mutual  Coopera- 
tion and  Security  was  concluded,  which  renewed  the  United  States 
role  as  military  protector  of  Japan,  massive  street  protests  and  po- 
litical upheaval  occurred,  and  the  cabinet  resigned  a  month  after 
the  Diet's  ratification  of  the  treaty.  Thereafter  political  turmoil  sub- 
sided. Japanese  views  of  the  United  States,  after  years  of  mass  pro- 
tests over  nuclear  armaments  and  the  mutual  defense  pact, 
improved  by  1972,  with  the  reversion  of  United  States-occupied 
Okinawa  to  Japanese  sovereignty  and  the  winding-down  of  the  Sec- 
ond Indochina  War  (1954-75). 

Japan  had  reestablished  relations  with  the  Republic  of  China 
after  World  War  II,  and  cordial  relations  were  maintained  with 
the  nationalist  government  when  it  was  exiled  to  Taiwan,  a  policy 
that  won  Japan  the  enmity  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China,  which 
was  established  in  1949.  After  the  general  warming  of  relations  be- 
tween China  and  Western  countries,  especially  the  United  States, 
which  shocked  Japan  with  its  sudden  rapprochement  with  Beijing 
in  1971 ,  Tokyo  established  relations  with  Beijing  in  1972  and  close 
cooperation  in  the  economic  sphere  followed  (see  Communist  Coun- 
tries, ch.  5;  Relations  with  China,  ch.  7). 

Japan's  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union  continued  to  be 
problematic  long  after  the  war.  The  main  object  of  dispute  was 
the  Soviet  occupation  of  what  Japan  calls  its  Northern  Territories, 
the  two  most  southerly  islands  in  the  Kurils  (Etorofu  and  Kunashiri) 
and  Shikotan  and  the  Habomai  Islands  (northeast  of  Hokkaido), 
which  were  seized  by  the  Soviets  in  the  closing  days  of  World  War 
II  (see  Soviet  Union,  ch.  7).

Historical  Setting 


Throughout  the  postwar  period,  Japan's  economy  continued  to 
boom,  with  results  far  outstripping  expectations.  Japan  rapidly 
caught  up  with  the  West  in  foreign  trade,  gross  national  product 
(GNP — see  Glossary),  and  general  quality  of  life  (see  Living  Stan- 
dards, ch.  4;  Postwar  Development,  ch.  5).  These  achievements 
were  underscored  by  the  1964  Tokyo  Olympic  Games  and  the 
Osaka  International  Exposition  (Expo  '70)  world's  fair  in  1970. 

The  high  economic  growth  and  political  tranquility  of  the  mid- 
to-late  1960s  were  tempered  by  the  quadrupling  of  oil  prices  by 
the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  in  1973.  Almost 
completely  dependent  on  imports  for  petroleum,  Japan  experienced 
its  first  and  only  recession  since  the  war. 

Despite  its  wealth  and  central  position  in  the  world  economy, 
Japan  has  had  little  or  no  influence  in  global  politics  for  much  of 
the  postwar  period.  Under  the  prime  ministership  of  Tanaka  Kakuei 
(1972-74),  Japan  took  a  stronger  but  still  low-key  stance  by  stead- 
ily increasing  its  defense  spending  and  easing  trade  frictions  with 
the  United  States.  Tanaka' s  administration  was  also  characterized 
by  high-level  talks  with  United  States,  Soviet,  and  Chinese  lead- 
ers, if  with  mixed  results.  His  visits  to  Indonesia  and  Thailand 
prompted  riots,  a  manifestation  of  long-standing  anti-Japanese  sen- 
timents (see  Relations  with  other  Asian  Countries,  ch.  7).  Tanaka 
was  forced  to  resign  in  1974  because  of  his  alleged  connection  to 
financial  scandals  and,  in  the  face  of  charges  of  involvement  in  the 
Lockheed  bribery  scandal,  he  was  arrested  and  jailed  briefly  in  1976. 

By  the  late  1970s,  the  Komeito  and  the  Democratic  Socialist  Party 
had  come  to  accept  the  Treaty  of  Mutual  Cooperation  and  Secu- 
rity, and  the  Democratic  Socialist  Party  even  came  to  support  a 
small  defense  buildup.  The  Japan  Socialist  Party,  too,  was  forced 
to  abandon  its  once  strict  antimilitary  stance.  The  United  States 
kept  up  pressure  on  Japan  to  increase  its  defense  spending  above 
1  percent  of  its  GNP,  engendering  much  debate  in  the  Diet,  with 
most  opposition  coming  not  from  minority  parties  or  public  opin- 
ion but  from  budget-conscious  officials  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance 
(see  Defense  Spending,  ch.  8). 

The  fractious  politics  of  the  LDP  hindered  consensus  in  the  Diet 
in  the  late  1970s.  The  sudden  death  of  Prime  Minister  Ohira 
Masayoshi  just  before  the  June  1980  elections,  however,  brought 
out  a  sympathy  vote  for  the  party  and  gave  the  new  prime  minister, 
Suzuki  Zenko,  a  working  majority.  Suzuki  was  soon  swept  up  in 
a  controversy  over  the  publication  of  a  textbook  that  appeared  to 
many  of  Japan's  former  enemies  as  a  whitewash  of  Japanese  ag- 
gression in  World  War  II.  This  incident,  and  serious  fiscal 


65 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

problems,  caused  the  Suzuki  cabinet,  composed  of  numerous  LDP 
factions,  to  fall. 

Nakasone  Yasuhiro,  a  conservative  backed  by  the  still-powerful 
Tanaka  and  Suzuki  factions,  who  once  served  as  director  general 
of  the  Defense  Agency,  became  prime  minister  in  November  1982. 
Several  cordial  visits  between  Nakasone  and  United  States  presi- 
dent Ronald  Reagan  were  aimed  at  improving  relations  between 
their  countries.  Nakasone 's  more  strident  position  on  Japanese 
defense  issues  made  him  popular  with  some  United  States  officials 
but  not,  generally,  in  Japan  or  among  Asian  neighbors.  Although 
his  characterization  of  Japan  as  an  "unsinkable  aircraft  carrier," 
his  noting  the  "common  destiny"  of  Japan  and  the  United  States, 
and  his  calling  for  revisions  to  Article  9  of  the  Constitution  (which 
renounced  war  as  the  sovereign  right  of  the  nation),  among  other 
prorearmament  statements,  produced  negative  reactions  at  home 
and  abroad,  a  gradual  acceptance  emerged  of  the  Self-Defense 
Forces  and  the  mutual  security  treaty  with  the  United  States  in 
the  mid-1980s. 

Another  serious  problem  was  Japan's  growing  trade  surplus, 
which  reached  record  heights  during  Nakasone 's  first  term  (see  For- 
eign Trade  Policies;  Trade  and  Investment  Relations,  ch.  5).  The 
United  States  pressured  Japan  to  remedy  the  imbalance,  demanding 
that  Tokyo  raise  the  value  of  the  yen  and  open  its  markets  further 
to  facilitate  more  imports  from  the  United  States.  Because  Japan 
aids  and  protects  its  key  industries,  it  was  accused  of  creating  an 
unfair  competitive  advantage.  Tokyo  agreed  to  try  to  resolve  these 
problems,  but  generally  defended  its  industrial  policies  and  made 
concessions  on  its  trade  restrictions  very  reluctantly. 

In  November  1984,  Nakasone  was  chosen  for  a  second  term  as 
LDP  president.  His  cabinet  received  an  unusually  high  rating,  a 
50  percent  favorable  response  in  polling  during  his  first  term,  while 
opposition  parties  reached  a  new  low  in  popular  support.  As  he 
moved  into  his  second  term,  Nakasone  thus  held  a  strong  position 
in  the  Diet  and  the  nation.  Despite  being  found  guilty  of  bribery 
in  1983,  Tanaka  in  the  early  to  mid-1980s  remained  a  power  be- 
hind the  scenes  through  his  control  of  the  party's  informal  apparatus 
and  continued  as  an  influential  adviser  to  the  more  internationally 
minded  Nakasone.  Fluctuation  in  the  popularity  of  the  LDP  and 
charges  of  corruption  among  political  leaders  continued  as  the  de- 
cade progressed.

JAPAN  IS  KNOWN  throughout  the  world  for  its  economic  suc- 
cesses, yet  Japanese  society  remains  an  enigma  to  many  outside 
its  borders.  Those  people  who  stress  the  nation's  uniqueness,  in- 
cluding many  Japanese,  often  overlook  the  common  human  traits 
that  make  cross-cultural  communication  possible  and  rewarding. 
Those  who  stress  Japan's  convergence  with  the  West  miss  the  deeper 
differences  that  have  allowed  Japan  to  chart  its  own  path  through 
the  unknowns  of  the  postindustrial  period. 

Geography  and  climate  do  not  determine  social  organization  or 
values,  but  they  do  set  parameters  for  human  action.  Leaders  of 
this  island  nation  historically  have  exerted  close  political  control 
over  their  people  and  limited  foreign  influence  to  degrees  not  pos- 
sible elsewhere.  Mountainous  terrain  and  wet-rice  agriculture 
fostered — but  did  not  ensure — attitudes  of  cooperation  within  the 
social  unit  and  a  sense  of  separateness  from  the  outside.  Extend- 
ing nearly  3,800  kilometers  from  northeast  to  southwest,  Japan  has 
a  generally  mild,  temperate  climate  with  a  rich  variety  of  local 
habitats.  This  expansiveness  resulted  in  regional  variations  in  cul- 
ture and  economic  development  historically,  but  these  differences 
decreased  in  importance  (or  were  relegated  to  tourist  attractions) 
in  the  twentieth  century.  With  77  percent  of  the  population  living 
in  urban  areas  and  a  large  majority  of  farm  families  earning  most 
of  their  income  from  nonfarm  labor,  regional  and  rural-urban  differ- 
ences in  life-style  were  minimal  in  the  early  1990s.  The  large  and 
stable  national  population,  with  low  fertility  and  mortality  rates, 
was  aging  rapidly. 

Japanese  society  underwent  great  social  changes  after  1945.  Fam- 
ilies became  smaller,  women  increasingly  participated  in  paid  labor, 
and  urban  life  replaced  the  rural  community  as  the  common  en- 
vironment in  which  children  were  raised  and  human  interaction 
took  place.  The  changes  brought  new  problems,  such  as  industrial 
pollution,  the  entrance  examination  ' 'hell,"  and  social  anomie.  The 
government  responded  with  new  policies,  and  ordinary  citizens  uti- 
lized traditional  customs  to  give  meaning  to  the  present.  Japanese 
cities  in  the  late  twentieth  century  were  convenient  and  safe.  Sur- 
face prosperity  masked  an  unequal  distribution  of  wealth  and 
discrimination  against  those  perceived  to  be  "different."  Films, 
television,  nightlife,  and  comic  books  (manga),  sometimes  garish 
and  violent,  offered  an  escape  from  the  pressures  of  contemporary 
life.  Categorization  of  social  problems  as  medical  syndromes  tended

to  focus  attention  on  personal-problem  solving  and  away  from 
societal-level  causes,  such  as  poverty,  gender  roles,  or  the  lack  of 
assistance  in  caring  for  ill  elderly  relatives. 

The  pace  and  rhythm  of  life  in  1990  Japan  would  have  seemed 
familiar  to  Westerners.  Yet  the  Japanese  approached  them  with 
a  world  view  eclectically  derived  from  a  variety  of  religious  and 
secular  traditions,  emphasizing  human  relations.  Many  Japanese 
were  willing  to  delay  rewards,  to  put  forth  their  best  efforts  for  their 
teams,  and  to  avoid  open  conflict.  The  outside  world  was  an  arena 
of  intense  competition.  Family,  neighborhood,  and  workplace  rep- 
resented ever-widening  circles  of  social  relations  to  which  individuals 
adjusted  and  through  which  they  grew  as  human  beings. 

Japan,  with  the  world's  second  largest  gross  national  product 
(GNP — see  Glossary)  and  seventh  largest  population,  played  an 
increasingly  important  part  in  world  affairs.  As  the  government 
embarked  on  a  policy  of  internationalization,  individual  Japanese 
creatively  combined  elements  from  their  own  history  with  foreign 
influences  and  new  inventions,  as  they  adapted  to  the  postindus- 
trial  world. 

Physical  Setting 

Composition,  Topography,  and  Drainage 

The  mountainous  islands  of  the  Japanese  Archipelago  form  a 
crescent  off  the  eastern  coast  of  Asia  (see  fig.  1).  They  are  sepa- 
rated from  the  mainland  by  the  Sea  of  Japan,  which  historically 
served  as  a  protective  barrier.  Japan's  insular  nature,  together  with 
the  compactness  of  its  main  territory  and  the  cultural  homogen- 
eity of  its  people,  enabled  the  nation  to  remain  free  of  outside  dom- 
ination until  its  defeat  in  World  War  II  (see  World  War  II  and 
the  Occupation,  1941-52,  ch.  1).  The  country  consists  of  four  prin- 
cipal islands:  Hokkaido,  Honshu,  Shikoku,  and  Kyushu;  more  than 
3,000  adjacent  islands  and  islets,  including  Oshima  in  the  Nampo 
chain;  and  more  than  200  other  smaller  islands,  including  those 
of  the  Amami,  Okinawa,  and  Sakishima  chains  of  the  Ryiikyu 
Archipelago.  The  national  territory  also  includes  the  small  Bonin 
Islands  (called  Ogasawara  by  the  Japanese),  I  wo  Jima,  and  the  Vol- 
cano Islands  (Kazan  Retto),  stretching  some  1,100  kilometers  from 
the  main  islands.  A  territorial  dispute  with  the  Soviet  Union,  dat- 
ing from  the  end  of  World  War  II,  over  the  two  southernmost  of 
the  Kuril  Islands,  Etorofu  and  Kunashiri,  and  the  smaller  Shikotan 
and  Habomai  island  groups  northeast  of  Hokkaido  remained 
a  sensitive  spot  in  Japan-Soviet  Union  relations  throughout  the 
1980s  (see  Relations  with  the  Soviet  Union,  ch.  7).  Excluding

disputed  territory,  the  archipelago  covers  about  377,000  square 
kilometers.  No  point  in  Japan  is  more  than  150  kilometers  from 
the  sea. 

The  four  major  islands  are  separated  by  narrow  straits  and  form 
a  natural  entity.  The  Ryukyii  Islands  curve  970  kilometers  south- 
ward from  Kyushu. 

The  distance  between  Japan  and  the  Korean  Peninsula,  the 
nearest  point  on  the  Asian  continent,  is  about  200  kilometers  at 
the  Korea  Strait.  Japan  has  always  been  linked  with  the  continent 
through  trade  routes,  stretching  in  the  north  toward  Siberia,  in 
the  west  through  the  Tsushima  Islands  to  the  Korean  Peninsula, 
and  in  the  south  to  the  ports  on  the  south  China  coast. 

The  Japanese  islands  are  the  summits  of  mountain  ridges  up- 
lifted near  the  outer  edge  of  the  continental  shelf.  About  75  per- 
cent of  Japan's  area  is  mountainous,  and  scattered  plains  and 
intermontane  basins  (in  which  the  population  is  concentrated)  cover 
only  about  25  percent.  A  long  chain  of  mountains  runs  down  the 
middle  of  the  archipelago,  dividing  it  into  two  halves,  the  ''face," 
fronting  on  the  Pacific  Ocean,  and  the  "back,"  toward  the  Sea 
of  Japan.  On  the  Pacific  side  are  steep  mountains  1,500  to  3,000 
meters  high  ,with  deep  valleys  and  gorges.  Central  Japan  is  marked 
by  the  convergence  of  the  three  mountain  chains — the  Hida,  Kiso, 


73

and  Akaishi  mountains — that  form  the  Japanese  Alps  (Nihon 
Arupusu),  several  of  whose  peaks  are  higher  than  3,000  meters. 
The  highest  point  in  the  Japanese  Alps  is  Kitadake  at  3, 192  meters. 
The  highest  point  in  the  country  is  Mount  Fuji  (Fujisan,  also  called 
Fujiyama  in  the  West  but  not  in  Japan),  a  volcano  dormant  since 
1707  that  rises  to  3,776  meters  above  sea  level  in  Shizuoka  Prefec- 
ture. On  the  Sea  of  Japan  side  are  plateaus  and  low  mountain  dis- 
tricts, with  altitudes  of  500  to  1,500  meters. 

None  of  the  populated  plains  or  mountain  basins  is  exten- 
sive in  area.  The  largest,  the  Kanto  Plain,  where  Tokyo  is  situated, 
covers  only  13,000  square  kilometers.  Other  important  plains  are 
the  Nobi  Plain  surrounding  Nagoya,  the  Kinki  Plain  in  the  Osaka- 
Kyoto  area,  the  Sendai  Plain  around  the  city  of  Sendai  in  north- 
eastern Honshu,  and  the  Ishikari  Plain  on  Hokkaido.  Many  of  these 
plains  are  along  the  coast,  and  their  areas  have  been  increased  by 
reclamation  throughout  recorded  history. 

The  small  amount  of  habitable  land  prompted  significant  human 
modification  of  the  terrain  over  many  centuries.  Land  was  reclaimed 
from  the  sea  and  from  river  deltas  by  building  dikes  and  drainage, 
and  rice  paddies  were  built  on  terraces  carved  into  mountainsides. 
The  process  continued  in  the  modern  period  with  extension  of  shore- 
lines and  building  of  artificial  islands  for  industrial  and  port 
development,  such  as  Port  Island  in  Kobe  and  the  new  Kansai  In- 
ternational Airport,  which  was  under  construction  in  Osaka  Bay 
in  1 990 .  Hills  and  even  mountains  have  been  razed  to  provide  flat 
areas  for  housing. 

Rivers  are  generally  steep  and  swift,  and  few  are  suitable  for 
navigation  except  in  their  lower  reaches.  Most  rivers  are  less  than 
300  kilometers  in  length,  but  their  rapid  flow  from  the  mountains 
provides  a  valuable,  renewable  resource:  hydroelectric  power  gener- 
ation. Japan's  hydroelectric  power  potential  has  been  exploited 
almost  to  capacity.  Seasonal  variations  in  flow  have  led  to  exten- 
sive development  of  flood  control  measures.  Most  of  the  rivers  are 
very  short.  The  longest,  the  Shinano,  which  winds  through  Nagano 
Prefecture  to  Niigata  Prefecture  and  flows  into  the  Sea  of  Japan, 
is  only  367  kilometers  long.  The  largest  freshwater  lake  is  Lake 
Biwa,  northeast  of  Kyoto. 

Extensive  coastal  shipping,  especially  around  the  Inland  Sea  (Seto 
Naikai)  compensates  for  the  lack  of  navigable  rivers.  The  Pacific 
coastline  south  of  Tokyo  is  characterized  by  long,  narrow,  gradu- 
ally shallowing  inlets  produced  by  sedimentation,  which  has  created 
many  natural  harbors.  The  Pacific  coastline  north  of  Tokyo,  the 
coast  of  Hokkaido,  and  the  Sea  of  Japan  coast  are  generally  un- 
indented,  with  few  natural  harbors  (see  fig.  3).

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 

Geographic  Regions 

The  country's  forty-seven  prefectures  are  grouped  into  eight 
regions  frequently  used  as  statistical  units  in  government  documents 
(see  Local  Government,  ch.  6).  The  islands  of  Hokkaido,  Shikoku, 
and  Kyushu  each  form  a  region,  and  the  main  island  of  Honshu 
is  divided  into  five  regions. 

Hokkaido 

Hokkaido,  about  83,500  square  kilometers  in  area,  constitutes 
more  than  20  percent  of  Japan's  land  area.  Like  the  other  main 
islands,  Hokkaido  is  generally  mountainous,  but  its  mountains  are 
lower  than  in  other  parts  of  Japan;  many  have  leveled  summits, 
and  hills  predominate.  Valleys  cut  through  the  terrain,  and  com- 
munications are  comparatively  easy.  Hokkaido  was  long  looked 
upon  as  a  remote  frontier  area,  and  until  the  second  half  of  the 
nineteenth  century  was  left  largely  to  the  indigenous  Ainu  (see 
Minorities,  this  ch.).  The  Ainu  in  the  1980s  numbered  fewer  than 
20,000,  and  they  were  being  rapidly  assimilated  into  the  main 
Japanese  population.  Since  the  movement  of  modern  technology 
and  development  into  the  area  in  the  late  nineteenth  century, 
Hokkaido  has  been  considered  the  major  center  of  Japanese  agricul- 
ture, forestry,  fishing,  and  mining.  Hokkaido,  with  about  90  per- 
cent of  Japan's  pastureland,  produced  the  same  proportion  of  its 
dairy  products  in  the  late  1980s.  Manufacturing  industry  played 
a  smaller  role  compared  to  the  other  regions. 

Hokkaido's  environmental  quality  and  rural  character  were 
altered  by  industrial  and  residential  development  in  the  1980s,  with 
developments  such  as  the  completion  of  the  Seikan  Tunnel  link- 
ing Hokkaido  and  Honshu.  Hokkaido  was  both  an  important 
agricultural  center  and  a  growing  industrial  area,  with  most  in- 
dustrial development  near  Sapporo,  the  prefectural  capital. 

Tdhoku 

The  northeastern  part  of  Honshu,  called  Tohoku  (literally  "the 
northeast"),  includes  six  prefectures.  Tohoku,  like  most  of  Japan, 
is  hilly  or  mountainous.  Its  initial  historical  settlement  occurred 
between  the  seventh  and  ninth  centuries  A.D.,  well  after  Japanese 
civilization  and  culture  had  become  firmly  established  in  central 
and  southwestern  Japan.  Although  iron,  steel,  cement,  chemical, 
pulp,  and  petroleum-refining  industries  began  developing  in  the 
1960s,  Tohoku  was  traditionally  considered  the  granary  of  Japan 
because  it  supplied  Sendai  and  the  Tokyo-Yokohama  market  with 
rice  and  other  farm  commodities.  Tdhoku  provided  20  percent  of

is  hilly  or  mountainous.  Its  initial  historical  settlement  occurred

77

the  nation's  rice  crop  (see  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fishing,  ch.  4). 
The  climate,  however,  is  harsher  than  in  other  parts  of  Honshu 
and  permits  only  one  crop  a  year  on  paddy  land. 

The  inland  location  of  many  of  the  region's  lowlands  has  led  to 
a  concentration  of  much  of  the  population  there.  Coupled  with 
coastlines  that  do  not  favor  port  development,  this  settlement  pat- 
tern resulted  in  a  much  greater  than  usual  dependence  on  land  and 
railroad  transportation.  Low  points  in  the  central  mountain  range 
fortunately  make  communications  between  lowlands  on  either  side 
of  the  range  moderately  easy.  Tourism  became  a  major  industry 
in  the  Tohoku  region,  with  points  of  interest  including  the  islands 
of  Matsushima  Bay,  Lake  Towada,  the  Rikuchu  Coasdine  National 
Park,  and  the  Bandai-Asahi  National  Park. 

Kantd 

The  Kanto  ("east  of  the  barrier")  region  encompasses  seven 
prefectures  around  Tokyo  on  the  Kanto  Plain.  The  plain  itself, 
however,  makes  up  only  slighdy  more  than  40  percent  of  the  region. 
The  rest  consists  of  the  hills  and  mountains  that  border  it  except 
on  the  seaward  side.  Once  the  heartland  of  feudal  power,  the  Kanto 
became  the  center  of  modern  development  (see  Tokugawa  Period, 
1600-1867,  ch.  1).  Within  the  Tokyo-Yokohama  metropolitan  area, 
the  Kanto  housed  not  only  Japan's  seat  of  government,  but  also 
the  largest  group  of  universities  and  cultural  institutions  in  addi- 
tion to  the  greatest  population  and  a  large  industrial  zone.  Although 
most  of  the  Kanto  Plain  was  used  for  residential,  commercial,  or 
industrial  construction,  it  was  still  farmed  in  the  early  1990s.  Rice 
was  the  principal  crop,  although  the  zone  around  Tokyo  and  Yoko- 
hama had  been  landscaped  to  grow  garden  produce  for  the 
metropolitan  market. 

The  Kanto  region  in  the  late  twentieth  century  was  the  most 
highly  developed,  urbanized,  and  industrialized  part  of  Japan. 
Tokyo  and  Yokohama  formed  a  single  industrial  complex  with  a 
concentration  of  light  and  heavy  industry  along  Tokyo  Bay.  Smaller 
cities,  farther  away  from  the  coast,  housed  substantial  light  indus- 
try. The  average  population  density  reached  5,471  persons  per 
square  kilometer  in  1987  (see  Population  Density,  this  ch.). 

Chubu 

The  Chubu  or  central  region  encompasses  nine  prefectures  in 
the  midland  of  Japan,  west  of  the  Kanto  region.  The  region  is  the 
widest  part  of  Honshu  and  is  characterized  by  high,  rugged  moun- 
tains. The  Japanese  Alps  divide  the  country  into  the  sunnier  Pa- 
cific side,  known  as  the  front  of  Japan  or  Omote-Nihon,  and  the 


78 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


colder  Sea  of  Japan  side,  or  Ura-Nihon,  the  back  of  Japan.  The 
region  comprises  three  distinct  districts:  Hokuriku,  a  coastal  strip 
on  the  Sea  of  Japan  that  is  a  major  wet-rice  producing  area;  Tosan, 
or  the  Central  Highlands;  and  Tokai,  or  the  eastern  seaboard,  a  nar- 
row corridor  along  the  Pacific  Coast. 

Hokuriku  lies  west  of  the  massive  mountains  that  occupy  the 
central  Chubu  region.  The  district  has  a  very  heavy  snowfall  and 
strong  winds.  Its  turbulent  rivers  are  the  source  of  abundant  hydro- 
electric power.  Niigata  Prefecture  is  the  site  of  domestic  gas  and 
oil  production.  Industrial  development  is  extensive,  especially  in 
the  cities  of  Niigata  and  Toyama.  Fukui  and  Kanazawa  also  have 
large  manufacturing  industries.  Hokuriku  developed  largely  in- 
dependently of  other  regions,  mainly  because  it  remained  relatively 
isolated  from  the  major  industrial  and  cultural  centers  on  the  Pa- 
cific Coast.  Because  port  facilities  were  limited  and  road  transport 
hampered  by  heavy  winter  snows,  the  district  relied  largely  on  rail- 
road transportation  (see  Railroads  and  Subways,  ch.  4). 

The  Tosan  district  is  an  area  of  complex  and  high  rugged 
mountains — often  called  the  roof  of  Japan — that  include  the  Japa- 
nese Alps.  The  population  is*  chiefly  concentrated  in  six  elevated 
basins  connected  by  narrow  valleys.  Tosan  was  long  a  main  silk- 
producing  area,  although  output  declined  after  World  War  II. 
Much  of  the  labor  formerly  required  in  silk  production  was  ab- 
sorbed by  the  district's  diversified  manufacturing  industry,  which 
included  precision  instruments,  machinery,  textiles,  food  process- 
ing, and  other  light  manufacturing. 

The  Tokai  district,  bordering  the  Pacific  Ocean,  is  a  narrow  cor- 
ridor interrupted  in  places  by  mountains  that  descend  into  the  sea. 
Since  the  Tokugawa  period  (1600-1867),  this  corridor  has  been 
important  in  linking  Tokyo,  Kyoto,  and  Osaka.  One  of  old  Japan's 
most  famous  roads,  the  Tokaido,  ran  through  it  connecting  Edo 
(Tokyo,  since  1868)  and  Kyoto,  the  old  imperial  capital;  in  the 
twentieth  century  it  became  the  route  of  new  super-express  high- 
ways and  high-speed  railroad  lines. 

A  number  of  small  alluvial  plains  are  found  in  the  corridor  sec- 
tion. A  mild  climate,  favorable  location  relative  to  the  great 
metropolitan  complexes,  and  the  availability  of  fast  transportation 
have  made  them  truck-gardening  centers  for  out-of- season  vegeta- 
bles. Upland  areas  of  rolling  hills  are  extensively  given  over  to  the 
growing  of  mandarin  oranges  and  tea.  The  corridor  also  has  a  num- 
ber of  important  small  industrial  centers.  The  western  part  of  Tokai 
includes  the  Nobi  Plain,  where  rice  was  grown  by  the  seventh  cen- 
tury A.D.  Nagoya,  facing  Ise  Bay,  is  a  center  for  heavy  industry, 
including  iron  and  steel  and  machinery  manufacturing.

Kinki 

The  Kinki  region  lies  to  the  west  of  Tokai  and  consists  of  seven 
prefectures  forming  a  comparatively  narrow  area  of  Honshu, 
stretching  from  the  Sea  of  Japan  on  the  north  to  the  Pacific  Ocean 
on  the  south.  It  includes  Japan js  second  largest  industrial- 
commercial  complex,  centered  on  Osaka  and  Kobe,  and  the  two 
former  capital  cities  of  Nara  and  Kyoto,  seats  of  the  imperial  fam- 
ily from  the  early  eighth  century  A.D.  until  the  Meiji  Restoration 
in  1868  (see  The  Meiji  Restoration,  ch.  1).  The  area  is  rich  in  im- 
perial and  cultural  history  and  attracts  many  Japanese  and  foreign 
tourists ._ 

The  Osaka  Plain  is  the  site  of  Osaka,  Kobe,  and  a  number  of 
intermediate- sized  industrial  cities,  which  together  form  the  Han- 
shin  commercial-industrial  complex.  The  suburbs  of  Osaka  were 
given  over  to  farming,  including  vegetables,  dairy  farming,  poultry 
raising,  and  rice  cultivation  in  the  1980s.  These  areas  were  progres- 
sively reduced  as  the  cities  expanded  and  residential  areas,  including 
numerous  so-called  "new  cities,"  were  built,  such  as  the  develop- 
ments north  of  Osaka  resulting  from  the  Osaka  International  Ex- 
position (Expo  '70)  world's  fair. 

Chugoku 

The  Chugoku  region,  occupying  the  western  end  of  Honshu  en- 
compasses five  prefectures.  It  is  characterized  by  irregular  rolling 
hills  and  limited  plain  areas  and  is  divided  into  two  distinct  parts 
by  mountains  running  east  and  west  through  its  center.  The  north- 
ern, somewhat  narrower,  district  is  known  as  San'in,  or  "shady 
side  of  the  mountain,"  and  the  southern  district,  as  San'yo,  or 
"sunny  side,"  because  of  their  marked  differences  in  climate.  The 
whole  Inland  Sea  region,  including  San'yo  underwent  rapid  de- 
velopment in  the  late  twentieth  century.  The  city  of  Hiroshima, 
rebuilt  after  being  destroyed  by  the  atomic  bomb  in  1945,  was  an 
industrial  metropolis  of  more  than  2.8  million  people  by  1987.  Over- 
fishing and  pollution  reduced  the  productivity  of  the  Inland  Sea 
fishing  grounds,  and  the  area  concentrated  on  heavy  industry. 
San'in,  on  the  other  hand,  was  less  industrialized  and  relied  on 
agriculture. 

Shikoku 

The  Shikoku  region — comprising  the  entire  island  of  Shikoku— 
covers  about  18,800  square  kilometers  and  consists  of  four  prefec- 
tures. It  is  connected  to  Honshu  by  ferry  and  air,  and  since  1988 
by  the  Seto-Ohashi  bridge  network.  Until  completion  of  the  bridges, 


80 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  region  was  isolated  from  the  rest  of  Japan,  and  the  freer  move- 
ment between  Honshu  and  Shikoku  was  expected  to  promote  eco- 
nomic development  on  both  sides  of  the  bridges. 

Mountains  running  east  and  west  divide  Shikoku  into  a  narrow 
northern  subregion,  fronting  on  the  Inland  Sea,  and  a  southern 
part  facing  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Most  of  the  population  lived  in  the 
north  in  the  1980s,  and  all  but  one  of  the  island's  few  larger  cites 
were  located  there.  Industry  was  moderately  well  developed  and 
included  the  processing  of  ores  from  the  important  Besshi  copper 
mine.  Land  was  used  intensively.  Wide  alluvial  areas,  especially 
in  the  eastern  part  of  the  zone,  were  planted  with  rice  and  subse- 
quently double  cropped  with  winter  wheat  and  barley.  Fruit  was 
grown  throughout  the  northern  area  in  great  variety,  including 
citrus  fruits,  persimmons,  peaches,  and  grapes. 

The  larger  southern  section  of  Shikoku  is  mountainous  and 
sparsely  populated.  The  only  significant  lowland  is  a  small  alluvial 
plain  at  Kochi,  a  prefectural  capital.  The  section's  mild  winters 
stimulated  some  truck  farming,  specializing  in  growing  out-of- 
season  vegetables  under  plastic  covering.  Two  crops  of  rice  can 
be  cultivated  annually  in  the  southern  portion.  The  pulp  and  paper 
industry  took  advantage  of  the  abundant  forests  and  hydroelectric 
power. 

Kyushu 

Kyushu,  meaning  "nine  provinces"  (from  its  ancient  adminis- 
trative structure),  is  the  southernmost  of  the  main  islands  and  in 
modern  times  comprises  seven  prefectures.  It  was  the  stepping  stone 
to  Honshu  for  early  migrants  from  the  Korean  Peninsula  and  a 
channel  for  the  spread  of  ideas  from  the  Asian  mainland  (see  Early 
Developments,  ch.  1).  Kyushu  lies  at  the  western  end  of  the  In- 
land Sea.  Its  northern  extremity  is  only  about  1 .6  kilometers  from 
Honshu,  and  the  two  islands  are  connected  by  the  Kammon  Bridge 
and  by  three  tunnels,  including  one  for  the  Japan  Railways  Group's 
Shinkansen  (bullet  train).  The  region  is  divided  not  only  geographi- 
cally, but  economically,  by  the  Kyushu  Mountains,  which  run  di- 
agonally across  the  middle  of  the  island.  The  north,  including 
Kitakyushu  industrial  region,  became  increasingly  urbanized  and 
industrialized  after  World  War  II,  while  the  agricultural  south  be- 
came relatively  poorer.  The  hilly  northwestern  part  of  the  island 
has  extensive  coal  deposits,  the  second  largest  in  Japan,  which 
formed  the  basis  for  a  large  iron  and  steel  industry.  An  extensive 
lowland  area,  in  the  northwest,  between  Kumamoto  and  Saga,  was 
an  important  farming  district  in  the  late  1980s.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

The  climate  of  Kyushu  is  generally  warm  and  humid,  and  the 
cultivation  of  vegetables  and  fruits  was  supplemented  by  cattle  rais- 
ing. The  cities  of  Kitakyushu  and  Sasebo  were  noted  for  iron  and 
steel  production,  and  Nagasaki  for  manufacturing.  Nagasaki  is  a 
city  of  historical  and  cultural  importance,  a  center  for  Chinese  and 
Western  influences  from  the  sixteenth  century  on,  and  the  only 
port  open  to  foreign  ships  during  most  of  the  Tokugawa  period. 
Like  Hiroshima,  it  also  was  rebuilt  after  being  devastated  by  an 
atomic  bomb  attack  in  1945. 

Ryukyu  Islands 

The  Ryukyu  Islands  include  more  than  200  islands  and  islets — 
some  little  more  than  coral  outcrops — of  which  fewer  than  half  are 
populated.  They  extend  in  a  chain  generally  southwestward  from 
the  Tokara  Strait,  which  separates  them  from  the  oudying  islands 
of  Kyushu,  to  within  120  kilometers  of  Taiwan.  The  Ryukyus  are 
considered  part  of  the  Ryushu  region  but  historically  have  been 
quite  distinctively  separate  from  the  rest  of  the  region. 

The  islands  are  the  tops  of  mountain  ranges  along  the  outer  edge 
of  the  continental  shelf.  They  are  generally  hilly  or  mountainous, 
with  active  volcanos  occurring  mainly  in  the  northern  part  of  the 
archipelago.  Okinawa  is  the  largest  and  economically  the  most  im- 
portant of  the  Ryukyus.  There  was  little  industry  in  the  1980s,  and 
the  economy  relied  heavily  on  tourism.  Northern  Okinawa  is  quite 
rugged  and  forested,  while  the  southern  part  consists  of  rolling  hills. 
Although  agriculture  and  fishing  remained  the  occupations  of  most 
of  the  population  in  the  Ryukyus,  the  region  experienced  consider- 
able industrial  expansion  during  the  period  of  United  States  occu- 
pation from  1945  to  1972. 

Climate 

Lying  in  the  middle  latitudes,  covering  about  22°  of  latitude  in 
the  northern  hemisphere,  Japan  is  generally  a  rainy  country  with 
high  humidity.  Because  of  its  wide  range  of  latitude,  Japan  has 
diverse  climates,  with  a  range  often  compared  to  that  of  the  east 
coast  of  North  America,  from  Nova  Scotia  to  Georgia.  Tokyo's 
latitude  is  about  36°  north,  comparable  to  that  of  Tehran,  Athens, 
or  Los  Angeles.  The  generally  humid,  temperate  climate  exhibits 
marked  seasonal  variation  celebrated  in  art  and  literature,  as  well 
as  regional  variations  ranging  from  cool  in  Hokkaido  to  subtropi- 
cal in  Kyushu.  Climate  also  varies  with  altitude  and  with  location 
on  the  Pacific  Ocean  or  on  the  Sea  of  Japan.  Northern  Japan  has 
warm  summers  but  long,  cold  winters  with  heavy  snow.  Central 


82 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 

Japan  has  hot,  humid  summers  and  short  winters,  and  southwestern 
Japan  has  long,  hot,  humid  summers  and  mild  winters. 

Two  primary  factors  influence  Japanese  climate:  a  location  near 
the  Asian  continent  and  the  existence  of  major  oceanic  currents. 
The  climate  from  June  to  September  is  marked  by  hot,  wet  weather 
brought  by  tropical  airflows  from  the  Pacific  Ocean  and  Southeast 
Asia.  These  airflows  are  full  of  moisture  and  deposit  substantial 
amounts  of  rain  when  they  reach  land.  There  is  a  marked  rainy 
season,  beginning  in  early  June  and  continuing  for  about  a  month. 
It  is  followed  by  hot,  sticky  weather.  Five  or  six  typhoons  pass  over 
or  near  Japan  every  year  from  early  August  to  early  September, 
sometimes  resulting  in  significant  damage.  Annual  precipitation, 
which  averages  between  100  and  200  centimeters,  is  concentrated 
in  the  period  between  June  and  September.  In  fact,  70  to  80  per- 
cent of  the  annual  precipitation  falls  during  this  period.  In  winter, 
a  high-pressure  area  develops  over  Siberia,  and  a  low-pressure  area 
over  the  northern  Pacific  Ocean.  The  result  is  a  flow  of  cold  air 
eastward  across  Japan  that  brings  freezing  temperatures  and  heavy 
snowfalls  to  the  central  mountain  ranges  facing  the  Sea  of  Japan, 
but  clear  skies  to  areas  fronting  on  the  Pacific. 

Two  major  ocean  currents  affect  this  climatic  pattern.  The  warm 
Kuroshio  Current  (Black  Current;  also  known  as  the  Japan  Cur- 
rent) and  the  cold  Oyashio  Current  (Parent  Current;  also  known 
as  the  Okhotsk  Current).  The  Kuroshio  Current  flows  northward 
on  the  Pacific  side  of  Japan  and  warms  areas  as  far  north  as  Tokyo; 
a  small  branch,  the  Tsushima  Current,  flows  up  the  Sea  of  Japan 
side.  The  Oyashio  Current,  which  abounds  in  plankton  beneficial 
to  cold-water  fish,  flows  southward  along  the  northern  Pacific,  cool- 
ing adjacent  coastal  areas.  The  meeting  point  of  these  currents  at 
latitude  36°  north  is  a  bountiful  fishing  ground. 

Earthquakes 

Ten  percent  of  the  world's  active  volcanos — 40  in  the  1980s 
(another  148  were  dormant) — are  found  in  Japan,  which  lies  in 
a  zone  of  extreme  crustal  instability.  As  many  as  1 ,500  earthquakes 
are  recorded  yearly,  and  magnitudes  of  four  to  six  on  the  Richter 
scale  are  not  uncommon.  Minor  tremors  occur  almost  daily  in  one 
part  of  the  country  or  another,  causing  slight  shaking  of  buildings. 
Major  earthquakes  occur  infrequently;  the  most  famous  in  the  twen- 
tieth century  was  the  great  Kanto  earthquake  of  1923,  in  which 
130,000  people  died.  Undersea  earthquakes  also  expose  the  Japa- 
nese coastline  to  danger  from  tsunami. 

Japan  has  become  a  world  leader  in  research  on  causes  and 
prediction  of  earthquakes.  The  development  of  advanced  technology 


83 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

has  permitted  the  construction  of  skyscrapers  even  in  earthquake- 
prone  areas.  Extensive  civil  defense  efforts  focus  on  training  in  pro- 
tection against  earthquakes,  in  particular  against  accompanying 
fire,  which  represents  the  greatest  danger. 

Pollution 

As  Japan  changed  from  an  agricultural  society  to  an  urbanized 
industrial  power,  much  of  its  natural  beauty  was  destroyed  and 
defaced  by  overcrowding  and  industrial  development.  However, 
as  the  world's  leading  importer  of  both  exhaustible  and  renewable 
natural  resources  and  the  second  largest  consumer  of  fossil  fuels, 
Japan  came  to  realize  that  it  had  a  major  international  responsi- 
bility to  conserve  and  protect  the  environment.  By  1990  Japan  had 
some  of  the  world's  strictest  environmental  protection  regulations. 

These  regulations  were  the  consequence  of  a  number  of  well  pub- 
licized environmental  disasters.  Cadmium  poisoning  from  indus- 
trial waste  in  Toyama  Prefecture  was  discovered  to  be  the  cause 
of  the  extremely  painful  itai-itai  disease  {itai-itai  means  ouch-ouch), 
which  causes  severe  pain  in  the  back  and  joints,  contributes  to  britde 
bones  that  fracture  easily,  and  brings  about  degeneration  of  the 
kidneys.  Recovery  of  cadmium  effluent  halted  the  spread  of  the 
disease,  and  no  new  cases  have  been  recorded  since  1946.  In  the 
1960s,  hundreds  of  inhabitants  of  Minamata  City  in  Kumamoto 
Prefecture  contracted  "Minamata  disease,"  a  degeneration  of  the 
central  nervous  system  caused  by  eating  mercury-poisoned  seafood 
from  Minamata  Bay  (nearly  1 ,300  cases  of  Minamata  disease  had 
been  diagnosed  by  1979).  In  Yokkaichi,  a  port  in  Mie  Prefecture, 
air  pollution  caused  by  sulfur  oxide  and  nitrogen  oxide  emissions 
led  to  a  rapid  increase  in  the  number  of  people  suffering  from 
asthma  and  bronchitis.  In  urban  areas,  photochemical  smog  from 
automotive  and  industrial  exhaust  fumes  also  contributed  to  the 
rise  in  respiratory  problems.  In  the  early  1970s,  chronic  arsenic 
poisoning  attributed  to  dust  from  local  arsenic  mines  (since  shut 
down)  was  experienced  in  Shimane  and  Miyazaki  prefectures.  The 
incidence  of  polychlorobiphenyl  (PCB)  poisoning,  caused  by  pol- 
luted cooking  oil  and  food,  particularly  seafood,  was  also  prob- 
lematic. 

Grass-roots  pressure  groups  were  formed  in  the  1960s  and  1970s 
as  a  response  to  increasing  environmental  problems.  These  groups 
were  independent  of  formal  political  parties  and  focused  on  sin- 
gle, usually  local,  environmental  issues.  Such  citizens'  movements 
were  reminiscent  of  earlier  citizen  protests  in  the  1890s.  As  a  result 
of  this  pressure,  Japan  began  in  the  early  1970s  to  combat  pollu- 
tion on  an  official  governmental  level,  with  the  establishment  of 


84 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  Environmental  Agency.  Although  the  agency  lacked  strong  pub- 
lic influence  and  political  power,  it  established  effective  regulations 
to  curb  pollution  from  photochemical  smog  through  strict  automo- 
tive emissions  standards.  It  also  worked  to  reduce  noise  from  trains 
and  airplanes,  to  remove  mining,  forestry,  and  tourist  debris  left 
on  mountainsides  and  in  national  forests,  and  to  monitor  noise  and 
air  pollutant  levels  in  major  cities. 

Groups  also  pressured  the  government  and  industry  for  a  sys- 
tem of  compensation  for  pollution  victims.  A  series  of  lawsuits  in 
the  early  1970s  established  that  corporations  were  responsible  for 
damage  cause  by  their  products  or  activities.  The  Pollution  Health 
Damage  Compensation  Law  of  1973  provides  industry  funds  for 
victims.  Compensation,  however,  was  slow,  and  awards  small,  while 
the  establishment  of  a  government  fund  helped  industry  diffuse 
public  outrage.  In  1984,  it  was  reported  that  Japan  had  more  than 
85,000  recognized  victims  of  environmental  pollution,  with  an  esti- 
mated rate  of  increase  of  6  percent  a  year.  The  regulations  aimed 
at  business  were  not  enough  to  solve  Japan's  environmental 
problems,  according  to  the  Environmental  Agency's  1989  White 
Paper  on  the  Environment,  although  public  awareness  and  interest  had 
grown  and  a  number  of  civic  and  public  interest  groups  had  been 
established  to  combat  pollution.  Fewer  public  interest  groups  were 
engaged  in  the  environmental  debate  than  in  antinuclear  issues, 
and  the  peak  of  public  interest  in  the  environment  occurred  in  the 
1970s  and  early  1980s. 

Japan  had  still  not  addressed  worldwide  environmental  issues 
adequately.  Japanese  whaling  continued  in  the  late  1980s  to  be  the 
object  of  international  protest,  and  Japanese  corporate  involvement 
in  the  deforestation  of  Southeast  Asia  created  concern  among 
domestic  and  international  groups. 

The  late  1980s  saw  the  beginnings  of  change.  In  a  1984  public 
opinion  poll  conducted  by  the  government,  Japanese  citizens  had 
indicated  less  concern  for  environmental  problems  than  their  Euro- 
pean counterparts.  In  the  same  year,  the  Environmental  Agency 
had  issued  its  first  white  paper  calling  for  greater  participation  by 
Japan's  public  and  private  sectors  in  protecting  the  global  environ- 
ment. That  challenge  was  repeated  in  the  1989  study.  When  citizens 
were  asked  in  1989  if  they  thought  environmental  problems  had 
improved  compared  with  the  past,  nearly  41  percent  thought  things 
had  improved,  31  percent  thought  that  they  had  stayed  the  same, 
and  nearly  21  percent  thought  that  they  had  worsened.  Some  75 
percent  of  those  surveyed  expressed  concern  about  endangered  spe- 
cies, shrinkage  of  rain  forests,  expansion  of  deserts,  destruction  of 
the  ozone  layer,  acid  rain,  and  increased  water  and  air  pollution 


85 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

in  developing  cquntries.  Most  believed  that  Japan,  alone  or  in 
cooperation  withbther  industrialized  countries,  had  the  responsi- 
bility to  solve  environmental  problems.  Although  environmental 
public  interest  groups  were  not  as  numerous  or  active  as  they  had 
been  in  the  1970s,  the  increased  awareness  of  global  environmen- 
tal issues  was  likely  to  result  in  increased  grass-roots  activism. 

Since  the  1960s,  Japan  has  made  slow  but  significant  progress 
in  combating  environmental  problems.  Efforts  made  in  the  late 
1980s  created  a  base  of  technology  and  concern  that  was  expected 
to  help  the  Japanese  face  the  environmental  issues  of  the  1990s. 

Population 

With  a  population  of  122.6  million  in  1988,  Japan  was  three  times 
more  densely  populated  than  Europe  as  a  whole  and  twelve  times 
more  densely  populated  than  the  United  States.  The  population 
has  grown  more  than  threefold  since  1872,  when  it  stood  at  34.8 
million.  Beginning  in  the  1950s  the  birth  rate  declined,  however, 
and  by  the  late  1980s  the  rate  of  natural  increase  was  0.5  percent, 
the  lowest  in  the  world  outside  Europe.  Both  the  density  and  the 
age  structure  of  Japan's  population  are  likely  to  influence  the  coun- 
try's future. 

Population  Density 

Japan  had  an  average  of  324  persons  per  square  kilometer  in 
1988,  high  compared  with  China  (115),  the  United  States  (26),  or 
the  Soviet  Union  (13),  but  lower  than  in  some  other  Asian  coun- 
tries, such  as  the  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea),  which  had  428 
people  per  square  kilometer.  The  population  per  square  kilometer 
of  habitable  land  in  1988  was  1,523  persons,  however,  compared 
with  384  in  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany), 
165  in  France,  and  54  in  the  United  States.  About  77  percent  of 
the  population  lived  in  urban  areas,  and  the  Pacific  Coast  from 
Tokyo  to  Osaka  was  particularly  densely  populated.  Well  over  50 
percent  of  the  Japanese  population  lived  on  slightly  over  2  percent 
of  its  land. 

Japan's  population  density  has  helped  promote  extremely  high 
land  prices.  Between  1955  and  1989,  land  prices  in  the  six  largest 
cities  increased  15,456  percent.  Urban  land  prices  generally  in- 
creased 40  percent  from  1980  to  1987;  in  the  six  largest  cities,  the 
price  of  land  doubled  over  that  period.  For  many  families,  this  trend 
put  housing  in  central  cities  out  of  reach.  The  result  was  lengthy 
commutes  for  many  workers;  daily  commutes  of  up  to  two  hours 
each  way  were  not  uncommon  in  the  Tokyo  area  in  the  late  1980s. 
Despite  the  large  amount  of  forested  land  in  Japan,  parks  in  cities 


86 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


were  smaller  and  scarcer  than  in  major  European  or  United  States 
cities,  which  averaged  ten  times  the  amount  of  parkland  per  in- 
habitant. However,  despite  the  high  cost  of  urban  housing,  more 
people  were  likely  to  move  back  into  central  city  areas,  especially 
as  the  price  of  transportation  and  commuting  time  increased.  Na- 
tional and  regional  governments  devoted  resources  to  making 
regional  cities  and  rural  areas  more  attractive  by  developing  trans- 
portation networks,  social  services,  industry,  and  education  insti- 
tutions in  attempts  to  decentralize  settlement  and  improve  the 
quality  of  life.  Nevertheless,  major  cities,  especially  Tokyo,  re- 
mained attractive  to  young  people  seeking  education  and  jobs. 

Age  Structure 

Like  other  postindustrial  countries,  Japan  in  the  1980s  faced  the 
problems  associated  with  an  aging  population  (see  Patterns  of  De- 
velopment, ch.  4).  In  1988,  only  11.2  percent  of  the  population 
was  sixty-five  years  or  older,  but  projections  were  that  nearly  24 
percent  would  be  in  that  age  category  by  2020  (see  table  2,  Ap- 
pendix). That  shift  will  make  Japan  one  of  the  world's  most  el- 
derly societies,  and  the  change  will  have  taken  place  in  a  shorter 
span  of  time  than  in  any  other  country. 

This  aging  of  the  population  was  brought  about  by  a  combina- 
tion of  low  fertility  and  high  life  expectancies.  In  1988,  the  fertil- 
ity rate  was  11.9  per  1,000,  and  the  average  number  of  children 
born  to  a  woman  over  her  lifetime  had  been  fewer  than  two  since 
the  late  1970s  (the  average  number  was  1 .7  in  the  mid-1980s).  Fam- 
ily planning  was  nearly  universal,  with  condoms  and  legal  abortions 
the  main  forms  of  birth  control.  A  number  of  factors  contributed 
to  the  trend  toward  small  families:  late  marriage,  increased  par- 
ticipation of  women  in  the  labor  force,  small  living  spaces,  and  the 
high  costs  of  children's  education.  Life  expectancies  at  birth,  81.3 
years  for  women  and  75.5  years  for  men  in  1988,  were  the  highest 
in  the  world.  (The  expected  life  span  at  the  end  of  World  War  II, 
for  both  men  and  women,  was  fifty  years.)  The  mortality  rate  in 
1988  was  6  per  1,000.  The  leading  causes  of  death  were  cancer, 
heart  disease,  and  cerebrovascular  disease,  a  pattern  common  to 
postindustrial  societies  (see  Health  Care,  this  ch.). 

Public  policy,  the  media,  and  discussions  with  private  citizens 
revealed  a  high  level  of  concern  for  the  implications  of  one  in  four 
persons  in  Japan  being  sixty-five  or  older.  By  2025  the  depen- 
dency ratio  (the  ratio  of  people  under  fifteen  years  plus  those  sixty- 
five  and  older  to  those  aged  fifteen  to  sixty-five,  indicating  in  a 
general  way  the  ratio  of  the  dependent  population  to  the  working 
population)  was  expected  to  be  two  dependents  for  every  three 


87

workers.  The  aging  of  the  population  was  already  becoming  evi- 
dent in  the  aging  of  the  labor  force  and  the  shortage  of  young  work- 
ers in  the  late  1980s,  with  potential  impacts  on  employment 
practices,  wages  and  benefits,  and  the  roles  of  women  in  the  labor 
force  (see  The  Structure  of  Japan's  Labor  Markets,  ch.  4).  The 
increasing  proportion  of  elderly  people  in  the  population  also  had 
a  major  impact  on  government  spending.  As  recently  as  the  early 
1970s,  social  expenditures  amounted  to  only  about  6  percent  of 
Japan's  national  income.  In  1989,  that  portion  of  the  national  bud- 
get was  18  percent,  and  it  was  expected  that  by  2025,  27  percent 
of  national  income  would  be  spent  on  social  welfare. 

In  addition,  the  median  age  of  the  elderly  population  was  rising 
in  the  late  1980s  (see  fig.  4).  The  proportion  of  people  aged  seventy- 
five  to  eighty-five  was  expected  to  increase  from  6  percent  in  1985 


88 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


to  15  percent  in  2025.  Because  the  incidence  of  chronic  disease  in- 
creases with  age,  the  health-care  and  pension  systems,  too,  were 
expected  to  come  under  severe  strain.  The  government  in  the 
mid-1980s  began  to  reevaluate  the  relative  burdens  of  government 
and  the  private  sector  in  health  care  and  pensions,  and  it  estab- 
lished policies  to  control  government  costs  in  these  programs. 
Recognizing  the  lower  probability  that  an  elderly  person  will  be 
residing  with  an  adult  child  and  the  higher  probability  of  any  daugh- 
ter or  daughter-in-law's  participation  in  the  paid  labor  force,  the 
government  encouraged  establishment  of  nursing  homes,  day-care 
facilities  for  the  elderly,  and  home  health  programs.  Longer  life 
spans  were  altering  relations  between  spouses  and  across  genera- 
tions, creating  new  government  responsibilities,  and  changing  vir- 
tually all  aspects  of  social  life. 

Migration 

Between  6  million  and  7  million  people  moved  their  residences 
each  year  during  the  1980s.  About  50  percent  of  these  moves  were 
within  the  same  prefecture;  the  others  were  relocations  from  one 
prefecture  to  another.  During  Japan's  economic  development  in 
the  twentieth  century,  and  especially  during  the  1950s  and  1960s, 
migration  was  characterized  by  urbanization  as  people  from  rural 
areas  in  increasing  numbers  moved  to  the  larger  metropolitan  areas 
in  search  of  better  jobs  and  education.  Out-migration  from  rural 
prefectures  continued  in  the  late  1980s,  but  more  slowly  than  in 
previous  decades. 

In  the  1980s,  government  policy  provided  support  for  new  urban 
development  away  from  the  large  cities,  particularly  Tokyo,  and 
assisted  regional  cities  to  attract  young  people  to  live  and  work  there. 
Regional  cities  offered  familiarity  to  those  from  nearby  areas,  lower 
costs  of  living,  shorter  commutes,  and,  in  general,  a  more  relaxed 
life-style  then  could  be  had  in  larger  cities.  Young  people  continued 
to  move  to  large  cities,  however,  to  attend  universities  and  find 
work,  but  some  returned  to  regional  cities  (a  pattern  known  as 
U-turn)  or  to  their  prefecture  of  origin  (a  pattern  known  as  J-turn). 

Government  statistics  show  that  in  the  1980s  significant  num- 
bers of  people  left  the  largest  cities  (Tokyo  and  Osaka).  In  1988, 
more  than  500,000  people  left  Tokyo,  which  experienced  a  net  loss 
through  migration  of  nearly  73,000  for  the  year.  Osaka  had  a  net 
loss  of  nearly  36,000  in  the  same  year.  However,  the  prefectures 
showing  the  highest  net  growth  were  located  near  the  major  urban 
centers,  such  as  Saitama,  Chiba,  Ibaraki,  and  Kanazawa  around 
Tokyo,  and  Hyogo,  Nara,  and  Shiga  near  Osaka  and  Kyoto.  This 
pattern  suggests  a  process  of  suburbanization,  people  moving  away

from  the  cities  for  affordable  housing  but  still  commuting  there  for 
work  and  recreation,  rather  than  a  true  decentralization. 

Japanese  economic  success  has  led  to  an  increase  in  certain  types 
of  external  migration.  In  1988,  about  8.5  million  Japanese  went 
abroad.  Over  80  percent  of  these  people  traveled  as  tourists,  espe- 
cially visiting  other  parts  of  Asia  and  North  America.  However, 
about  548,000  Japanese  were  living  abroad,  48,000  of  whom  had 
permanent  foreign  residency,  about  four  times  the  number  who 
had  that  status  in  1975.  Nearly  200,000  Japanese  went  abroad  in 
1988  for  extended  periods  of  study,  research,  or  business  assign- 
ments. As  the  government  and  private  corporations  have  stressed 
internationalization,  greater  numbers  of  individuals  have  been 
directly  affected,  decreasing  Japan's  historically  claimed  insularity. 
Despite  the  benefits  of  experiencing  life  abroad,  individuals  who  have 
lived  outside  of  Japan  for  extended  periods  often  faced  problems 
of  discrimination  upon  their  return  because  others  might  no  longer 
consider  them  fully  Japanese.  By  the  late  1980s,  these  problems, 
particularly  the  bullying  of  returnee  children  in  the  schools,  had  be- 
come a  major  public  issue  both  in  Japan  and  in  Japanese  commu- 
nities abroad  (see  Primary  and  Secondary  Education,  ch.  3). 

Minorities 

Japanese  society,  with  its  ideology  of  homogeneity,  has  tradi- 
tionally been  intolerant  of  ethnic  and  other  differences.  People  iden- 
tified as  different  might  be  considered  "polluted" — the  category 
applied  historically  to  the  outcasts  of  Japan,  particularly  the 
burakumin — and  thus  not  suitable  as  marriage  partners  or  employees. 
Men  or  women  of  mixed  ancestry,  those  with  family  histories  of 
certain  diseases,  atomic  bomb  survivors  of  Hiroshima  and  Nagasaki 
and  their  descendants,  foreigners,  and  members  of  minority  groups 
faced  discrimination  in  a  variety  of  forms. 

Foreign  Residents 

If  Japanese  society  was  reluctant  to  readmit  returnees  in  the 
1980s,  it  was  even  less  willing  to  accept  those  people  who  were  not 
ethnic  Japanese  as  full  members  of  society.  In  1988  there  were 
941,000  foreign  residents  in  Japan,  less  than  1  percent  of  Japan's 
population  (if  illegal  aliens  were  counted,  the  number  of  foreign- 
ers might  be  several  times  higher  than  the  quoted  figure).  Of  this 
number,  677,000  (about  72  percent)  were  Koreans,  and  129,000 
(some  14  percent)  were  Chinese.  Many  of  these  people  were  descen- 
dants of  those  brought  to  Japan  during  Japan's  occupation  of  Tai- 
wan (1895-1945)  and  of  Korea  (1905-45)  to  work  at  unskilled  jobs, 
such  as  coal  mining.  Because  Japanese  citizenship  was  based  on 


90 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  nationality  of  the  parent  rather  than  the  place  of  birth,  subse- 
quent generations  were  not  automatically  Japanese  and  had  to  be 
naturalized  to  claim  citizenship,  despite  being  born  and  educated 
in  Japan  and  speaking  only  Japanese,  as  was  the  case  with  most 
Koreans  in  Japan.  Until  the  late  1980s,  people  applying  for  citizen- 
ship were  expected  to  use  only  the  Japanese  renderings  of  their 
names  and,  even  as  citizens,  continued  to  face  discrimination  in 
education,  employment,  and  marriage.  Thus,  few  chose  naturali- 
zation, and  they  faced  legal  restrictions  as  foreigners  as  well  as  ex- 
treme social  prejudice. 

All  non-Japanese  were  required  by  law  to  register  with  the 
government  and  carry  alien  registration  cards.  From  the  early 
1980s,  a  civil  disobedience  movement  encouraged  refusal  of  the 
fingerprinting  that  accompanied  registration  every  five  years.  Those 
people  who  opposed  fingerprinting  argued  that  it  was  discrimina- 
tory since  the  only  Japanese  who  were  fingerprinted  were  crimi- 
nals. The  courts  upheld  fingerprinting,  but  the  law  was  changed 
so  that  fingerprinting  was  done  once  rather  than  with  each  renew- 
al of  the  registration.  Some  Koreans,  often  with  the  support  of  either 
the  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea)  or  the  Democratic  People's 
Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea),  attempted  to  educate  their  chil- 
dren in  Korean  language,  history,  and  culture  and  to  instill  pride 
in  their  Korean  heritage.  Most  Koreans  in  Japan  in  1990,  however, 
had  never  been  to  the  Korean  Peninsula,  and  did  not  speak  Korean. 
Many  were  caught  in  a  vicious  cycle  of  poverty  and  discrimina- 
tion in  a  society  that  emphasized  Japan's  homogeneity  and  cul- 
tural uniqueness.  Other  Asians,  too,  whether  students  or  permanent 
residents,  faced  prejudice  and  a  strong  "we-they"  distinction.  Euro- 
peans and  North  Americans  might  be  treated  with  greater  hospi- 
tality but  nonetheless  found  it  difficult  to  become  full  members  of 
Japanese  society.  Public  awareness  of  the  place  of  foreigners  (gaijiri) 
in  Japanese  society  was  heightened  in  the  late  1980s  in  debates  over 
the  acceptance  of  Vietnamese  and  Chinese  refugees  and  the  im- 
porting of  Filipino  brides  for  rural  farmers. 

Burakumin 

Despite  Japan's  claim  of  homogeneity,  two  Japanese  minority 
groups  can  be  identified.  The  largest  is  known  as  burakumin  (liter- 
ally, residents  of  buraku,  hamlets),  descendants  of  premodern  out- 
cast hereditary  occupational  groups,  such  as  butchers,  leatherworkers, 
and  certain  entertainers.  Discrimination  against  these  occupational 
groups  arose  historically  because  of  Buddhist  prohibitions  against 
killing  and  Shinto  notions  of  pollution,  as  well  as  governmental  at- 
tempts at  social  control.  During  the  Tokugawa  period,  such  people 


91 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

were  required  to  live  in  special  buraku  and,  like  the  rest  of  the  popu- 
lation, were  bound  by  sumptuary  laws  based  on  the  inheritance 
of  social  class.  The  Meiji  government  abolished  derogatory  names 
applied  to  burakumin  in  1871,  but  the  new  laws  had  little  effect  on 
the  social  discrimination  faced  by  the  former  outcasts  and  their 
descendants.  The  laws,  however,  did  eliminate  the  economic  mo- 
nopoly they  had  over  certain  occupations. 

Burakumin  in  1990,  although  physically  indistinguishable  from 
other  Japanese,  often  lived  in  urban  ghettoes  or  in  the  traditional 
special  hamlets  in  rural  areas.  Some  attempted  to  pass  as  ordinary 
Japanese,  but  the  checks  on  family  background  that  were  often  part 
of  marriage  arrangements  and  employment  applications  made  this 
difficult.  Estimates  on  the  number  of  burakumin  ranged  from  2  mil- 
lion to  4  million,  or  about  2  to  3  percent  of  the  national  population. 

Ordinary  Japanese  claimed  that  burakumin  status  can  be  sur- 
mised from  the  location  of  the  family  home,  occupation,  dialect, 
or  mannerisms,  and,  despite  legal  equality,  continued  to  discrimi- 
nate against  people  they  surmised  to  be  burakumin.  Past  and  cur- 
rent discrimination  had  resulted  in  lower  educational  attainment 
and  socioeconomic  status  among  burakumin  than  among  the  majority 
of  Japanese.  Movements  with  objectives  ranging  from  "liberation" 
to  encouraging  integration  have  tried  over  the  years  to  change  this 
situation.  As  early  as  1922,  leaders  of  the  burakumin  community  or- 
ganized a  movement,  the  Levelers  Association  of  Japan  (Suiheisha), 
to  advance  their  rights.  After  World  War  II,  the  National  Commit- 
tee for  Burakumin  Liberation  was  founded,  changing  its  name  to 
the  Burakumin  Liberation  League  in  the  1950s.  The  league,  with 
the  support  of  the  socialist  and  communist  parties,  pressured  govern- 
ment into  making  important  concessions  in  the  late  1960s  and  1970s. 
One  concession  was  the  passing  of  a  Special  Measures  Law  for  As- 
similation Projects,  which  provided  financial  aid  for  burakumin  com- 
munities. Another  was  the  closing  of  nineteenth-century  family 
registers,  kept  by  the  Ministry  of  Justice  for  all  Japanese,  which  re- 
vealed the  outcaste  origins  of  burakumin  families  and  individuals. 
These  records  could  now  be  consulted  only  in  legal  cases,  making 
it  more  difficult  to  identify  or  discriminate  against  burakumin.  Even 
into  the  1980s,  however,  the  subjects  of  burakumin  discrimination 
and  liberation  were  taboo  in  public  discussion.  In  the  late  1970s, 
the  Sayama  incident,  which  involved  a  murder  conviction  of  a 
burakumin  based  on  circumstantial  evidence,  focused  public  atten- 
tion on  the  problems  of  the  burakumin.  In  the  1980s,  some  educa- 
tors and  local  governments,  particularly  in  areas  with  relatively  large 
burakumin  populations,  began  special  education  programs,  which  they 


92 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


hoped  would  encourage  greater  educational  and  economic  success 
for  young  burakumin  and  decrease  the  discrimination  they  faced. 

Ainu 

The  second  minority  group  among  Japanese  citizens  is  the  Ainu, 
who  are  thought  to  be  related  to  Tungusic,  Altaic,  and  Uralic  peo- 
ples of  Siberia.  Historically,  the  Ainu  (Ainu  means  human  in  the 
Ainu  language)  were  an  indigenous  hunting  and  gathering  popu- 
lation who  occupied  most  of  northern  Honshu  as  late  as  the  Nara 
period  (A.D.  710-94).  As  Japanese  settlement  expanded,  the  Ainu 
were  pushed  northward,  until  by  the  Meiji  period,  they  were  con- 
fined by  the  government  to  a  small  area  in  Hokkaido,  in  a  man- 
ner similar  to  the  placing  of  native  Americans  on  reservations. 
Characterized  as  remnants  of  a  primitive  circumpolar  culture,  the 
fewer  than  20,000  Ainu  in  1990  were  considered  racially  distinct 
and  thus  not  fully  Japanese.  Disease  and  a  low  birth  rate  had  se- 
verely diminished  their  numbers  over  the  past  two  centuries  and 
intermarriage  had  brought  about  an  almost  completely  mixed  popu- 
lation. 

Although  no  longer  in  daily  use,  the  Ainu  language  in  1990  was 
preserved  in  epics,  songs,  and  stories  transmitted  orally  over  suc- 
ceeding generations.  Distinctive  rhythmic  music  and  dances  and 
some  Ainu  festivals  and  crafts  were  preserved,  but  mainly  in  order 
to  take  advantage  of  tourism. 

Values  and  Beliefs 

Contemporary  Japan  is  a  secular  society.  Creating  harmonious 
relations  with  others  through  reciprocity  and  the  fulfillment  of  so- 
cial obligations  is  more  significant  for  most  Japanese  than  an  in- 
dividual's relationship  to  a  transcendent  God.  Harmony,  order, 
and  self-development  are  three  of  the  most  important  values  that 
underlie  Japanese  social  interaction.  Basic  ideas  about  self  and  the 
nature  of  human  society  are  drawn  from  several  religious  and 
philosophical  traditions.  Religious  practice,  too,  emphasizes  the 
maintenance  of  harmonious  relations  with  others  (both  spiritual 
beings  and  other  humans)  and  the  fulfillment  of  social  obligations 
as  a  member  of  a  family  and  a  community. 

Values 

Empathy  and  Human  Relations 

In  Japanese  mythology,  the  gods  display  human  emotions,  such 
as  love  and  anger.  In  these  stories,  behavior  that  results  in  positive 
relations  with  others  is  rewarded,  and  empathy,  identifying  oneself 


93 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


with  another,  is  highly  valued.  By  contrast,  those  actions  that  are 
antisocial,  or  that  harm  others,  are  condemned.  Hurtful  behavior 
is  punished  in  the  myths  by  ostracizing  the  offender. 

No  society  can  exist  that  tolerates  significant  antisocial  behavior 
in  the  long  term,  but  Japan  is  among  the  societies  that  most  strongly 
rely  on  social  rather  than  supernatural  sanctions  and  emphasize 
the  benefits  of  harmony.  Japanese  children  learn  from  their  earli- 
est days  that  human  fulfillment  comes  from  close  association  with 
others.  Children  learn  early  to  recognize  that  they  are  part  of  an 
interdependent  society,  beginning  in  the  family  and  later  extend- 
ing to  larger  groups  such  as  neighborhood,  school,  community, 
and  workplace.  Dependence  on  others  is  a  natural  part  of  the  human 
condition;  it  is  viewed  negatively  only  when  the  social  obligations 
it  creates  are  too  onerous  to  fulfill. 

In  interpersonal  relationships,  most  Japanese  tend  to  avoid  open 
competition  and  confrontation.  Working  with  others  requires  self- 
control,  but  it  carries  the  rewards  of  pride  in  contributing  to  the 
group,  emotional  security,  and  social  identity.  Wa,  the  notion  of 
harmony  within  a  group,  requires  an  attitude  of  cooperation  and 
a  recognition  of  social  roles.  If  each  individual  in  the  group  under- 
stands personal  obligations  and  empathizes  with  the  situations  of 
others,  then  the  group  as  a  whole  benefits.  Success  can  come  only 
if  all  put  forth  their  best  individual  efforts.  Decisions  are  often  made 
only  after  consulting  with  everyone  in  the  group.  Consensus  does 
not  imply  that  there  has  been  universal  agreement,  but  this  style 
of  consultative  decision  making  involves  each  member  of  the  group 
in  an  information  exchange,  reinforces  feelings  of  group  identity, 
and  makes  implementation  of  the  decision  smoother.  Cooperation 
within  a  group  also  is  often  focused  on  competition  between  that 
group  and  a  parallel  one,  whether  the  issue  is  one  of  educational 
success  or  market  share.  Symbols  such  as  uniforms,  names,  ban- 
ners, and  songs  identify  the  group  as  distinct  from  others  both  to 
outsiders  and  internally.  Participation  in  group  activities,  whether 
official  or  unofficial,  is  a  symbolic  statement  that  an  individual 
wishes  to  be  considered  part  of  the  group.  Thus,  after- work  bar 
hopping  provides  not  only  instrumental  opportunities  for  the  ex- 
change of  information  and  release  of  social  tensions,  but  also  op- 
portunities to  express  nonverbally  a  desire  for  continued  affiliation. 

Working  in  a  group  in  Japan  requires  the  development  of  suc- 
cessful channels  of  communication,  which  reinforce  group  inter- 
dependence and  the  sense  of  difference  from  those  who  are  not 
members  of  the  group.  Yet  social  interaction  beyond  that  which 
occurs  with  individuals  with  whom  one  lives  and  works  is  a  neces- 
sity in  contemporary  society.  If  the  exchange  is  brief  and  relatively 


94

discipline  combined  with  ancient  Chinese  fencing  techniques

insignificant,  such  as  buying  a  newspaper,  anonymity  will  be  main- 
tained. But  if  the  relationship  is  expected  to  continue  over  a  long 
period,  whether  in  business,  marriage,  employment,  or  neighbor- 
hood, great  care  is  likely  to  be  invested  in  establishing  and  main- 
taining good  relationships.  Such  relationships  are  often  begun  by 
using  the  social  networks  of  a  relative,  friend,  or  colleague  who 
can  provide  an  introduction  to  the  desired  person  or  serve  as  nakodo 
(go-between).  The  nakodo  most  often  refers  to  the  person  (or  peo- 
ple) who  negotiates  marriage  arrangements,  including  checking  each 
family's  background,  conveying  questions  and  criticisms,  and 
smoothing  out  difficulties.  But  this  kind  of  personal  mediation  is 
common  in  many  aspects  of  Japanese  life. 

Group  membership  in  Japan  provides  enjoyment  and  fulfillment, 
but  also  causes  tremendous  tension.  An  ideology  of  group  harmony 
does  not  ensure  harmony  in  fact.  Japan  is  an  extremely  competi- 
tive society,  yet  competition  within  the  group  must  be  suppressed. 
Minor  issues  are  sometimes  dealt  with  by  appeals  to  higher  author- 
ity, but  they  may  well  smolder  unresolved  for  years.  Major  problems 
may  be  denied,  especially  to  outsiders,  but  may  result  in  factions 
or  in  the  fissioning  of  the  group  (see  Interest  Groups,  ch.  6).  It 
is  often  the  individual,  however,  who  bears  the  burden  of  these 


95 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

interpersonal  tensions.  This  burden  is  reflected  in  high  rates  of  al- 
cohol consumption  and  of  minor,  sometimes  psychosomatic,  ill- 
ness. Many  Japanese  cope  with  these  stresses  by  retreating  into 
the  private  self  or  by  enjoying  the  escapism  offered  by  much  of 
the  popular  culture  (see  The  Arts,  ch.  3). 

The  Public  Sphere:  Order  and  Status 

It  is  difficult  to  imagine  a  Japanese  vision  of  the  social  order 
without  the  influence  of  Confucianism,  because  prior  to  the  ad- 
vent of  Chinese  influence  in  the  sixth  century,  Japan  did  not  have 
a  stratified  society  (see  Religious  and  Philosophical  Traditions,  this 
ch.).  Confucianism  emphasizes  harmony  among  heaven,  nature, 
and  human  society  achieved  through  each  person's  accepting  his 
or  her  social  role  and  contributing  to  the  social  order  by  proper 
behavior.  An  often  quoted  phrase  from  the  Confucian  essay  "Da 
Xue"  (The  Great  Learning)  explains,  "Their  persons  being  cul- 
tivated, their  families  were  regulated.  Their  families  being  regu- 
lated, their  states  were  rightly  governed.  Their  states  being  rightly 
governed,  the  whole  kingdom  was  made  tranquil  and  happy." 

This  view  implies  that  hierarchy  is  natural.  Relative  status  differ- 
ences define  nearly  all  social  interaction.  Age  or  seniority,  gender, 
educational  attainment,  and  place  of  employment  are  common  dis- 
tinctions that  guide  interaction.  Without  some  knowledge  of  the 
other's  background,  age  and  gender  may  be  an  individual's  only 
guidelines.  A  Japanese  person  may  prefer  not  to  interact  with  a 
stranger  to  avoid  potential  errors  in  etiquette.  The  business  cards 
or  calling  cards  so  frequently  exchanged  in  Japan  are  valuable  tools 
of  social  interaction  because  they  provide  enough  information  about 
another  person  to  facilitate  normal  social  exchange.  Japan  scholar 
Edwin  O.  Reischauer  noted  that  whereas  Americans  often  act  to 
minimize  status  differences,  Japanese  find  it  awkward,  even  un- 
becoming, when  a  person  does  not  behave  in  accordance  with  sta- 
tus expectations. 

The  Japanese  language  is  one  means  of  expressing  status  differ- 
ences and  contributes  to  the  assumption  that  hierarchy  is  natural. 
Verb  endings  regularly  express  relationships  of  superiority  or  in- 
feriority. Japanese  has  a  rich  vocabulary  of  honorific  and  humble 
terms  that  indicate  a  person's  status  or  may  be  manipulated  to  ex- 
press what  the  speaker  desires  the  relationship  to  be.  Men  and 
women  employ  somewhat  different  speech  patterns,  with  women 
making  greater  use  of  polite  forms.  Certain  words  are  identified 
with  masculine  speech  and  others  with  feminine.  For  example,  there 
are  a  number  of  ways  to  say  the  pronoun  "I,"  depending  on  the 
formality  of  the  occasion,  the  gender  of  the  speaker,  and  the  relative 


96

status  of  the  speaker  and  listener.  As  is  appropriate  in  a  culture 
that  stresses  the  value  of  empathy,  one  person  cannot  speak  without 
considering  the  other. 

The  term  hierarchy  implies  a  ranking  of  roles  and  a  rigid  set  of 
rules,  and  Japan  has  its  share  of  bureaucracy.  But  the  kind  of 
hierarchical  sense  that  pervades  the  whole  society  is  of  a  different 
sort,  which  anthropologist  Robert  Smith  calls  "diffuse  order."  For 
example,  in  premodern  times,  local  leaders  were  given  a  great  deal 
of  autonomy  in  exchange  for  assuming  total  responsibility  for  af- 
fairs in  their  localities.  In  contemporary  Japan  also,  responsibility 
is  collective  and  authority  diffuse.  The  person  seeming  to  be  in 
charge  is,  in  reality,  bound  into  the  web  of  group  interdependence 
as  tightly  as  those  who  appear  to  be  his  subordinates.  Leadership 
thus  calls  not  for  a  forceful  personality  and  sharp  decision-making 
skills,  but  for  sensitivity  to  the  feelings  of  others  and  skills  in  medi- 
ation. Even  in  the  early  1990s,  leaders  were  expected  to  assume 
responsibility  for  a  major  problem  occurring  in  or  because  of  their 
groups  by  resigning  their  posts,  although  they  may  have  had  no 
direct  involvement  in  the  situation. 

Status  in  Japan  is  based  on  specific  relationships  between  in- 
dividuals, often  relationships  of  social  dependency  between  those 
of  unequal  status.  Girt  (duty),  the  sense  of  obligation  to  those  to 


97 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

whom  one  is  indebted,  requires  deferential  behavior  and  eventu- 
ally repayment  of  the  favor,  which  in  turn  calls  forth  future  favors. 
Relations  of  social  dependence  thus  continue  indefinitely,  with  their 
very  inequality  binding  individuals  to  each  other.  Rules  of  hier- 
archy are  tempered  by  the  relationship  itself.  This  tempering  is 
known  as  ninjo  (human  emotion  or  compassion).  The  potential  con- 
flict between  giri  and  ninjo  has  been  a  frequent  theme  in  Japanese 
drama  and  literature  (see  Performing  Arts;  Literature,  ch.  3). 
Although  young  Japanese  in  1990  were  less  likely  to  phrase  a  per- 
sonal dilemma  in  those  terms,  claiming  that  the  concept  of  gin  was 
old-fashioned,  many  continued  to  feel  stress  in  doing  what  they 
should  when  it  was  not  what  they  wanted.  Social  order  exists  in 
part  because  all  members  of  the  society  are  linked  in  relationships 
of  social  dependency,  each  involved  in  giving  and  receiving. 

The  Private  Sphere:  Goals  and  Self 

Relative  status  may  be  seen  as  the  basis  of  social  organization 
and  affiliation  with  others  may  be  considered  desirable,  but  these 
assumptions  by  no  means  negate  a  concept  of  self.  An  ideology 
of  harmony  with  others  does  not  automatically  create  a  congruence 
of  individual  with  group  or  institutional  goals.  Anthropologist  Brian 
Moeran  distinguishes  Japanese  attitudes  toward  individuality  and 
individualism.  Individuality,  or  the  uniqueness  of  a  person,  is  not 
only  tolerated,  but  often  admired  if  the  person  is  seen  as  sincere, 
as  acting  from  the  heart.  A  work  of  art  conveys  strength  as  well 
as  beauty  from  its  *  'individuality."  Individualism,  on  the  other 
hand,  is  viewed  negatively,  for  it  is  equated  with  selfishness,  the 
opposite  of  the  empathy  that  is  so  highly  valued.  While  many 
modern  Japanese  deny  the  relevance  of  the  concept  of  seishin  (self- 
less spiritual  strength,  as  in  World  War  II  soldiers),  selfishness  (es- 
pecially "selfish  mothers,"  because  the  behavior  of  mothers  is 
commonly  thought  to  effect  the  mental  and  physical  health  of  chil- 
dren) takes  the  blame  for  many  social  problems  of  modern  soci- 
ety. These  problems  include  ones  categorized  as  psychosomatic 
medical  syndromes,  such  as  kitchen  syndrome  (dadokoro  shokogun), 
in  which  formerly  meticulous  housewives  suddenly  adopt  odd  be- 
haviors and  complain  of  aches  and  pains,  nonverbally  expressing 
their  frustration  with  or  rejection  of  the  "good  wife-wise  mother" 
role,  or  school-refusal  syndrome  (toko  kyohi),  in  which  children  com- 
plain of  somatic  problems,  such  as  stomachaches,  and  thus  miss 
school  in  an  attempt  to  avoid  academic  or  social  failure. 

Japan,  like  all  other  societies,  has  conflicts  between  individual 
and  group.  What  is  different  from  North  American  society  is  not 
that  the  Japanese  have  no  sense  of  self,  but  rather  that  the  self  is 


98 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


defined  through  its  interaction  with  others  and  not  merely  through 
the  force  of  individual  personality. 

According  to  Japan  scholar  Edwin  O.  Reischauser,  "The  cooper- 
ative, relativistic  Japanese  is  not  thought  of  as  the  bland  product 
of  a  social  conditioning  that  has  worn  off  all  individualistic  cor- 
ners, but  rather  as  the  product  of  firm  inner  self-control  that  has 
made  him  master  of  his  .  .  .  anti- social  instincts  ....  Social  con- 
formity .  .  .  is  no  sign  of  weakness  but  rather  the  proud,  tempered 
product  of  inner  strength."  This  mastery  is  achieved  by  overcom- 
ing hardship,  through  self-discipline,  and  through  personal  striv- 
ing for  a  perfection  that  one  knows  is  not  possible  but  remains  a 
worthy  goal.  In  this  view,  both  the  self  and  society  can  be  improved, 
and  in  fact  are  interrelated,  since  the  ideal  of  selfhood  toward  which 
many  Japanese  strive  is  one  in  which  consideration  of  others  is  para- 
mount. Whereas  Americans  attempt  to  cultivate  a  self  that  is 
unique,  most  Japanese  place  greater  emphasis  on  cultivating  "a 
self  that  can  feel  human  in  the  company  of  others,"  according  to 
David  Plath.  Maturity  means  continuing  to  care  about  what  others 
are  thinking  but  feeling  confident  in  one's  ability  to  judge  and  act 
effectively,  acknowledging  social  norms  while  remaining  true  to  self. 

Religious  and  Philosophical  Traditions 

The  values  described  in  the  preceding  section  are  derived  from 
a  number  of  religious  and  philosophical  traditions,  both  indigenous 
and  foreign.  Taken  together,  these  traditions  may  be  considered 
the  Japanese  world  view,  although  the  personal  beliefs  of  an  in- 
dividual Japanese  may  incorporate  some  aspects  and  disregard 
others.  The  Japanese  world  view  is  eclectic,  contrasting  with  a 
Western  view  in  which  religion  is  exclusive  and  defines  one's  iden- 
tity. Contemporary  Japanese  society  is  highly  secular.  Cause  and 
effect  relations  are  frequently  based  in  scientific  models,  and  ill- 
ness and  death  are  explained  by  modern  medical  theories.  Yet  the 
scientific  view  is  but  one  of  the  options  from  which  an  individual 
may  draw  in  interpreting  life's  experiences. 

The  Japanese  world  view  is  characterized  also  by  a  pragmatic 
approach  to  problem  solving,  in  which  the  technique  may  be  less 
important  than  the  results.  Thus  a  Japanese  who  is  ill  may  simul- 
taneously or  sequentially  seek  the  assistance  of  a  medical  doctor, 
obtain  medication  from  a  person  trained  in  the  Chinese  herbal  tra- 
dition, and  visit  a  local  shrine.  Each  of  these  actions  is  based  on 
a  different  belief  in  causation  of  the  illness:  the  physician  may  say 
that  the  illness  is  due  to  a  bacterial  infection;  the  herbalist  regards 
the  body  as  being  out  of  balance;  and  the  basis  of  the  shrine  visit 
is  the  belief  that  the  mind  must  be  cleansed  to  heal  the  body.  In 


99 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

the  West,  these  explanations  might  be  viewed  as  mutually  exclu- 
sive, but  the  Japanese  patient  may  hold  all  of  these  views  simul- 
taneously without  a  sense  of  discord.  Similarly,  a  student  studying 
for  university  entrance  examinations  knows  that  without  extraor- 
dinary hard  work,  admission  is  impossible.  Yet  the  student  will 
probably  also  visit  a  special  shrine  to  ask  for  the  help  of  the  spiritual 
world  in  assuring  success. 

The  roots  of  the  Japanese  world  view  can  be  traced  to  several 
traditions.  Shinto,  the  only  indigenous  religion  of  Japan,  provided 
the  base.  Confucianism,  from  China,  provided  concepts  of  hier- 
archy, loyalty,  and  the  emperor  as  the  son  of  heaven.  Daoism,  also 
from  China,  helped  give  order  and  sanction  to  the  system  of  govern- 
ment implied  in  Shinto.  Buddhism  brought  with  it  not  only  its  con- 
templative religious  aspects  but  also  a  developed  culture  of  art  and 
temples,  which  had  a  considerable  role  in  public  life.  Christianity 
brought  an  infusion  of  Western  ideas,  particularly  those  involving 
social  justice  and  reform. 

Shinto 

Shinto  (Way  of  the  Gods)  is  the  term  used  to  refer  to  an  assort- 
ment of  beliefs  and  practices  indigenous  to  Japan  that  predate  the 
arrival  of  Buddhism,  but  have  in  turn  been  influenced  by  it.  The 
Shinto  world  view  is  of  a  pantheistic  universe  of  kami,  spirits  or 
gods  with  varying  degrees  of  power. 

Although  each  person  is  expected  to  continue  existence  as  a  kami 
after  death,  Shinto  is  concerned  with  this  world  rather  than  with 
the  afterlife.  This  world  contains  defiling  substances,  and  Shinto 
ritual  often  involves  mental  and  physical  purification  of  a  person 
who  has  come  into  contact  with  a  pollutant,  such  as  death.  Water 
or  salt  commonly  serve  as  purifying  agents.  Some  kami  are  guar- 
dian deities  for  villages,  and  thus  they  symbolize  the  unity  of  the 
human  community  as  well  as  mediating  in  its  relationship  with  the 
natural  and  supernatural  worlds. 

Japanese  legends  describe  the  activities  and  personalities  of  the 
kami.  The  most  well-known  legends  describe  the  creation  of  the 
human  world  and  trace  the  origins  of  the  Japanese  imperial  fam- 
ily to  the  gods  (see  Ancient  Cultures,  ch.  1).  The  latter  legend 
formed  the  basis  of  the  wide  acceptance  of  the  concept  of  the  em- 
peror's divine  descent  in  pre- 1945  Japan. 

In  the  fifth  and  sixth  centuries,  Shinto  came  under  the  influence 
of  Chinese  Confucianism  and  Buddhism.  From  the  former,  it  bor- 
rowed the  veneration  of  ancestors,  and  from  the  latter  it  adopted 
philosophical  ideas  and  religious  rites.  Because  of  the  popularity 
of  things  Chinese  and  the  ethical  and  philosophical  attraction  of 


100 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Buddhism  for  the  court  and  the  imperial  family,  Shinto  became 
somewhat  less  influential  than  Buddhism  for  more  than  a  millen- 
nium. Many  people,  however,  were  adherents  to  both  systems  of 
belief.  By  the  seventeenth  century,  Shinto  began  to  emerge  from 
Buddhism's  shadow  through  the  influence  of  neo-Confucian  ra- 
tionalism (see  Intellectual  Trends,  ch.  1). 

The  emerging  nationalism  of  the  late  Tokugawa  period  com- 
bined with  the  political  needs  of  the  Meiji  Restoration  (1868) 
oligarchs  to  reform  Shinto  into  a  state  religion,  and  it  flourished 
as  such  until  1945  under  government  patronage.  Japan's  defeat 
in  World  War  II  and  the  emperor's  denial  of  his  divinity  brought 
an  end  to  State  Shinto  (see  The  Status  of  the  Emperor,  ch.  6).  Some- 
times considered  synonymous  with  State  Shinto  before  1945  was 
Shrine  Shinto  (Jinja  Shinto),  but  after  the  war  most  Shinto  tradi- 
tions were  observed  in  the  home  rather  than  in  shrines.  Most 
shrines,  which  had  previously  benefited  from  state  sponsorship,  were 
organized  into  the  Association  of  Shinto  Shrines  after  1946.  Sect 
Shinto  (Kyoha  Shinto)  consists  of  more  than  eighty  private  reli- 
gious sects,  which  conduct  services  in  houses  of  worship  or  lecture 
halls  rather  than  in  shrines. 

In  1987  there  were  more  than  81,350  Shinto  shrines  and  102,000 
clergy  in  Japan.  After  World  War  II,  the  requirement  of  mem- 
bership in  a  shrine  parish  was  revoked,  but  in  1990  local  shrines 
still  served  as  focal  points  for  community  identity  for  many 
Japanese,  and  occasional  informal  or  ritual  visits  are  common. 
Nearly  95  million  Japanese  citizens  professed  adherence  to  some 
form  of  Shinto.  Some  of  the  Sect  Shinto  groups  are  considered  new 
religions. 

Buddhism 

Buddhism,  which  originated  in  India,  was  introduced  into  Japan 
in  the  sixth  century  A.D.  from  Korea  and  China.  Buddhism  in- 
troduced ideas  into  Japanese  culture  that  have  become  insepara- 
ble from  the  Japanese  world  view:  the  concept  of  rebirth,  ideas  of 
karmic  causation,  and  an  emphasis  on  the  unity  of  experience.  It 
gained  the  patronage  of  the  ruling  class,  which  supported  the  build- 
ing of  temples  and  production  of  Buddhist  art  (see  Cultural  De- 
velopments and  the  Establishment  of  Buddhism,  ch.  1).  In  the  early 
centuries  of  Buddhism  in  Japan,  scholarly  esoteric  sects  were  popu- 
lar, and  the  Buddhist  influence  was  limited  mainly  to  the  upper 
class.  From  the  late  Heian  period  (A.D.  794-1185)  through  the 
Kamakura  period  (1185-1333),  Pure  Land  (Jodo)  and  Nichiren 
Shoshu  sects,  which  had  much  wider  appeal,  spread  throughout 
all  classes  of  society  (see  The  Flourishing  of  Buddhism,  ch.  1).  These

sects  stressed  experience  and  faith,  promising  salvation  in  a  future 
world.  Zen  Buddhism,  which  encourages  the  attainment  of  enlight- 
enment through  meditation  and  an  austere  life  style,  had  wide  ap- 
peal among  the  bushi  or  samurai — the  warrior  class — who  had  come 
to  have  great  political  power  (see  The  Rise  of  the  Military  Class, 
ch.  1).  Under  the  sponsorship  of  the  ruling  military  class,  Zen  had 
a  major  impact  on  Japanese  aesthetics.  In  addition,  Japan  scholar 
Robert  Bellah  has  argued,  Buddhist  sects  popular  among  com- 
moners in  the  Tokugawa  period  encouraged  values  such  as  hard 
work  and  delayed  rewards,  which,  like  Protestantism  in  Europe, 
helped  lay  the  ideological  foundation  for  Japan's  industrial  success. 

Buddhist  funerary  and  ancestral  rites  remained  pervasive  in 
Japan  in  the  late  1980s.  Although  regular  attendance  at  Buddhist 
temples  was  rare,  partly  because  many  Buddhist  sects  did  not  ob- 
serve community  worship,  there  were  in  1987  more  than  77,000 
temples  and  274,000  clergy.  Buddhist  as  well  as  Shinto  priests  marry 
and  often  sons  inherit  the  responsibility  for  their  father's  parish 
at  his  death.  The  Nichiren  school,  based  on  belief  in  the  Lotus  Sutra 
and  its  doctrine  of  universal  salvation,  was  the  largest  sect  in  Japan 
in  1989,  with  35,541,430  members.  Its  wide  appeal  was  based  on 
the  broad  range  of  religious  and  social  thought  and  the  lay  activi- 
ties it  incorporates. 

Confucianism 

Although  not  practiced  as  a  religion,  Confucianism  from  China 
has  deeply  influenced  Japanese  thought.  In  essence,  Confucian- 
ism is  the  practice  of  proper  forms  of  conduct,  especially  in  social 
and  familial  relationships.  It  is  derived  from  compilations  attributed 
to  the  fifth-century  B.C.  Chinese  philosopher  Kong  Fuzi  or  Kongzi 
(Confucius;  in  Japanese,  Koshi).  Confucian  government  was  to 
be  a  moral  government,  bureaucratic  in  form  and  benevolent 
toward  the  ruled.  Confucianism  also  provided  an  hierarchical  sys- 
tem, in  which  each  person  was  to  act  according  to  his  or  her  status 
to  create  a  harmoniously  functioning  society  and  ensure  loyalty  to 
the  state.  The  teachings  of  filial  piety  and  humanity  continue  to 
form  the  foundation  for  much  of  social  life  and  ideas  about  family 
and  nation. 

Neo-Confucianism,  introduced  to  Japan  in  the  twelfth  century, 
is  an  interpretation  of  nature  and  society  based  on  metaphysical 
principles,  and  influenced  by  Buddhist  and  Daoist  ideas.  In  Japan, 
where  it  is  known  as  Shushigaku  (Shushi  School,  after  the  Chinese 
neo-Confucian  scholar  Zhu  Xi — Shushi  in  Japanese),  it  brought 
the  idea  that  family  stability  and  social  responsibility  are  human 
obligations.  The  school  used  various  metaphysical  concepts  to 


104 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


explain  the  natural  and  social  order.  Shushigaku,  in  turn,  influenced 
the  kokutai  (national  polity)  theory,  which  emphasized  the  special 
national  characteristics  of  Japan. 

Daoism 

Daoism  (literally,  the  way)  from  China  has  also  influenced 
Japanese  thought,  and  has  a  special  affinity  for  Zen  Buddhism. 
Zen's  praise  of  emptiness,  exhortations  to  act  in  harmony  with  na- 
ture, and  admonitions  to  avoid  discrimination  and  duality  all  are 
parallel  in  Daoist  beliefs.  The  lunar  calendar,  the  selection  of  auspi- 
cious days  for  special  events,  the  siting  of  buildings,  and  numer- 
ous folk  medicinal  treatments  also  have  origins  in  Daoism  and 
continue  as  customs  to  varying  degrees  in  contemporary  Japanese 
society.  Daoism  has  also  influenced  native  shamanistic  traditions 
and  rituals. 

Christianity 

Christianity  was  introduced  in  the  sixteenth  century  by  Por- 
tuguese and  Spanish  Roman  Catholic  missionaries,  but,  because 
it  was  associated  with  Western  imperialism  and  considered  a  threat 
to  Japanese  political  control,  it  was  banned  from  the  mid- 
seventeenth  century  to  the  mid-nineteenth  century  (see  Seclusion 
and  Social  Control,  ch.  1).  With  the  reopening  of  Japan  in  the 
mid- 1850s,  missionaries  again  arrived.  While  fewer  than  900,000 
people  (less  than  1  percent  of  the  population)  considered  themselves 
Christian  in  the  late  1980s,  Christianity  was  respected  for  its  con- 
tributions to  society,  particularly  in  education  and  social  action. 
In  the  late  1980s,  about  64  percent  of  all  Christians  belonged  to 
Protestant  churches,  about  32  percent  to  the  Roman  Catholic 
Church,  and  about  4  percent  to  other  Christian  denominations. 
There  were  more  than  3,200  places  of  Christian  worship  in  Japan. 

New  Religions 

A  number  of  religious  organizations  are  generally  labeled  "new 
religions"  {shinko  shukyo),  although  some  date  back  to  the  early 
nineteenth  century.  The  largest  are  Soka  Gakkai  (Value  Creation 
Society),  Rissho  Koseikai  (Society  for  the  Establishment  of  Jus- 
tice and  Community  for  the  Rise  [of  Buddhism]),  and  Tenrikyo 
(Religion  of  Divine  Wisdom),  with  more  than  17  million,  6  mil- 
lion, and  about  2.5  million  members,  respectively,  in  the  late  1980s. 
Both  Soka  Gakkai  and  Rissho  Koseikai  are  offshoots  of  the  Nichiren 
Shoshu  sect  of  Buddhism.  Tenrikyo  was  once  considered  an  off- 
shoot of  Sect  Shinto  but  is  now  regarded  as  independent  of  other 


106 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


divisions  of  Shinto.  Some  of  the  larger  of  these  new  religions  were 
active  internationally  as  well  as  in  Japan. 

No  one  category  can  be  used  to  describe  all  of  the  new  religions. 
What  distinguishes  them  from  popular  or  folk  religions  is  their  claim 
to  an  organizational  status  equivalent  to  Shinto  or  Buddhism.  Their 
teachings  are  diverse,  but  most  syncretize  elements  of  Buddhist, 
Shinto,  Christian,  and  other  beliefs.  Most  emphasize  the  depen- 
dence of  the  living  on  kami,  the  Buddha  or  Buddhist  figures,  or 
ancestors.  Some,  such  as  Tenrikyo,  are  monotheistic  and  stress  in- 
dividual salvation.  For  example,  Rissho  Koseikai  adherents  gather 
in  small  groups  to  discuss  religious  issues  and  problems  of  daily 
life.  Most  of  the  new  religions  provide  special  support  to  their  ad- 
herents through  small  group  meetings,  and  encourage  solving 
problems  through  ritual  and  proper  behavior.  Many  stress  har- 
monious relations  with  others,  hard  work,  and  sincerity  as  the  way 
to  a  better  life. 

Most  of  the  new  religions  were  founded  by  charismatic  lay  peo- 
ple, often  women,  who  had  experienced  transforming  spiritual  epi- 
sodes and  felt  called  upon  to  convey  these  experiences  to  others. 
They  stressed  lay  participation,  involving  small,  local,  face-to-face 
groups  as  well  as  national  organizations.  They  encouraged  direct 
contact  with  the  supernatural,  and  some  groups  practiced  faith  heal- 
ing and  mutual  support  techniques.  People  who  joined  these  groups 
often  did  so  in  response  to  personal  problems,  but  many  found  con- 
tinuing fulfillment  through  their  emphasis  on  returning  to  tradi- 
tional values. 

Religious  Practice 

Most  Japanese  participate  in  rituals  and  customs  derived  from 
several  religious  traditions  (see  table  3,  Appendix).  Life  cycle  events 
are  often  marked  by  visits  to  a  Shinto  shrine.  The  birth  of  a  new 
baby  is  celebrated  with  a  formal  shrine  visit  at  the  age  of  about 
one  month,  as  are  the  third,  fifth,  and  seventh  birthdays  and  the 
official  beginning  of  adulthood  at  age  twenty.  Wedding  ceremo- 
nies are  often  performed  by  Shinto  priests,  but  Christian  weddings 
are  also  popular.  In  the  early  1980s,  more  than  8  percent  of  wed- 
dings were  held  in  a  shrine  or  temple  and  nearly  4  percent  in  a 
church.  The  most  popular  place  for  a  wedding  ceremony — chosen 
by  41  percent — was  a  wedding  hall. 

Funerals  are  most  often  performed  by  Buddhist  priests,  and 
Buddhist  rites  are  also  common  on  death  day  anniversaries  of  de- 
ceased family  members.  Some  Japanese  do  not  perform  ancestral 
ceremonies  at  all,  and  some  do  so  rather  mechanically  and  awk- 
wardly. But  there  have  also  been  changes  in  these  practices,  such 


107 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

as  more  personal  and  private  ceremonies  and  women  honoring  their 
own  as  well  as  their  husband's  ancestors,  that  make  them  more 
meaningful  to  contemporary  participants. 

There  are  two  categories  of  holidays  in  Japan:  matsuri  (festivals), 
which  are  largely  of  Shinto  origin  and  relate  to  the  cultivation  of 
rice  and  the  spiritual  well-being  of  the  community;  and  nenchu  gyd 
(annual  events),  mainly  of  Chinese  or  Buddhist  origin.  The  matsuri 
were  supplemented  during  the  Heian  period  with  more  festivals 
added,  and  they  were  organized  into  a  formal  calendar.  In  addi- 
tion to  the  complementary  nature  of  the  different  holidays,  there 
were  later  accretions  during  the  feudal  period.  Very  few  matsuri 
or  nenchu  gyd  are  national  holidays,  but  they  are  included  in  the 
national  calendar  of  annual  events  (see  table  4,  Appendix). 

Most  holidays  are  secular  in  nature,  but  the  two  most  significant 
for  the  majority  of  Japanese — New  Year's  Day  for  Shinto  believers 
and  Obon  (also  call  Bon  Festival)  for  Buddhists,  which  marks  the 
end  of  the  ancestors'  annual  visit  to  their  earthly  home — involve 
visits  to  Shinto  shrines  or  Buddhist  temples.  The  New  Year's  holi- 
day (January  1-3)  is  marked  by  the  practice  of  numerous  customs 
and  the  consumption  of  special  foods.  These  customs  include  time 
for  getting  together  with  family  and  friends,  for  special  television 
programming,  and  for  visiting  Shinto  shrines  to  pray  for  family  bless- 
ings in  the  coming  year.  Dressing  in  a  kimono,  hanging  out  special 
decorations,  eating  noodles  on  New  Year's  Eve  to  show  continuity 
into  the  new  year,  and  playing  a  poetry  card  game  are  among  the 
more  "traditional"  practices.  During  Obon  season,  in  mid- August 
(or  mid-July  depending  on  the  locale),  bon  (spirit  altars)  are  set  up 
in  front  of  Buddhist  family  altars,  which,  along  with  ancestral  graves, 
are  cleaned  in  anticipation  of  the  return  of  the  spirits.  As  with  the 
New  Year  holiday,  people  living  away  from  their  family  homes  return 
for  visits  with  relatives.  Celebrations  include  folk  dancing  and  prayers 
at  the  Buddhist  temple  as  well  as  family  rituals  in  the  home. 

Many  Japanese  also  participate,  at  least  as  spectators,  in  one 
of  the  many  local  matsuri  celebrated  throughout  the  country.  Matsuri 
may  be  sponsored  by  schools,  towns,  or  other  groups,  but  are  most 
often  associated  with  Shinto  shrines.  As  religious  festivals,  these 
strike  a  Western  observer  as  quite  commercialized  and  secular,  but 
the  many  who  plan  the  events,  cook  special  foods,  or  carry  the  floats 
on  their  shoulders,  find  renewal  of  self  and  of  community  through 
participation. 

Religion  and  the  State 

Article  20  of  the  1947  Constitution  states  that,  "Freedom  of 
religion  is  guaranteed  to  all.  No  religious  organization  shall  receive 


108 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


any  privileges  from  the  State,  nor  exercise  any  political  author- 
ity .  .  (see  The  Postwar  Constitution,  ch.  6).  Contemporary  re- 
ligious freedom  fits  well  with  the  tolerant  attitude  of  most  Japanese 
toward  other  religious  beliefs  and  practices.  Separation  of  religion 
and  the  state,  however,  is  a  more  difficult  issue. 

Historically,  there  was  no  distinction  between  a  scientific  and 
a  religious  world  view.  In  early  Japanese  history,  the  ruling  class 
was  responsible  for  performing  propitiatory  rituals,  which  later  came 
to  be  identified  as  Shinto,  and  for  the  introduction  and  support 
of  Buddhism.  Later,  religious  organization  was  used  by  regimes 
for  political  purposes,  as  when  the  Tokugawa  government  required 
each  family  to  be  registered  as  a  member  of  a  Buddhist  temple  for 
purposes  of  social  control.  In  the  late  nineteenth  century,  rightists 
created  State  Shinto,  requiring  that  each  family  belong  to  a  shrine 
parish  and  that  the  concepts  of  emperor  worship  and  a  national 
Japanese  "family"  be  taught  in  the  schools. 

In  the  1980s,  the  meaning  of  the  separation  of  state  and  religion 
again  became  controversial.  The  issue  came  to  a  head  in  1985  when 
Prime  Minister  Nakasone  Yasuhiro  paid  an  official  visit  to  Yasukuni 
Shrine,  which  honors  Japanese  war  dead,  including  leaders  from 
the  militarist  period  in  the  1930s  and  1940s  (see  The  Rise  of  the 
Militarists,  ch.  1).  Supporters  of  Nakasone 's  action  (mainly  on  the 
political  right)  argued  that  the  visit  was  to  pay  homage  to  patriots; 
others  claimed  that  the  visit  was  an  attempt  to  revive  State  Shinto 
and  nationalistic  extremism.  The  visit  was  protested  by  China, 
North  Korea,  South  Korea,  and  other  countries  occupied  by  Japan 
in  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth  century,  and  domestically  by  leftists, 
intellectuals,  and  the  Japanese  news  media.  Similar  cases  have  oc- 
curred at  local  levels,  and  courts  increasingly  often  have  been  asked 
to  clarify  the  division  between  religion  and  government.  Separat- 
ing religious  elements  of  the  Japanese  world  view  from  what  is 
merely  "Japanese"  is  not  easy,  especially  given  the  ambiguous  role 
of  the  emperor,  whose  divinity  was  denied  in  1945,  but  who  con- 
tinued to  perform  functions  of  both  state  and  religion. 

Social  Organization 

From  birth  Japanese  are  recognized  as  autonomous  human  beings. 
However,  from  the  beginning  infants  are  influenced  by  society's  em- 
phasis on  social  interdependence.  In  fact,  Japanese  human  develop- 
ment may  be  seen  as  a  movement  toward  mastery  of  an  ever- 
expanding  circle  of  social  life,  beginning  with  the  family,  widening 
to  include  school  and  neighborhood  as  children  grow,  and  incor- 
porating roles  as  colleague,  inferior,  and  superior.  Viewed  in  this 
perspective,  socialization  does  not  culminate  with  adolescence,  for 


110 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  individual  must  learn  to  be,  for  example,  a  section  chief,  a 
parent-teacher  association  member,  or  a  grandparent  at  various 
points  in  life. 

Many  Westerners  ask  whether  there  is  a  Japanese  self  that  exists 
apart  from  identification  with  a  group.  The  answer  lies  in  the 
Japanese  distinction  between  uchi  (inside)  and  soto  (outside).  These 
terms  are  relative,  and  the  "we"  implied  in  uchi  can  refer  to  the 
individual,  the  family,  a  work  group,  a  company,  a  neighborhood, 
or  even  all  of  Japan.  But  it  is  always  defined  in  opposition  to  a 
"they."  The  context  or  situation  thus  calls  for  some  level  of  defi- 
nition of  self.  When  an  American  businessman  meets  a  Japanese 
counterpart,  the  Japanese  will  define  himself  as  a  member  of  a  par- 
ticular company  with  which  the  American  is  doing  business. 
However,  if  the  American  makes  a  cultural  mistake,  the  Japanese 
is  likely  to  define  himself  as  Japanese  as  distinguished  from  a 
foreigner.  The  American  might  go  away  from  his  encounter  with 
the  belief  that  the  Japanese  think  of  themselves  only  as  members 
of  a  group.  The  same  person  attending  a  school  event  with  one 
of  his  children  might  be  defined  at  the  level  of  his  family  or  house- 
hold. Viewed  relaxing  at  home  or  playing  golf  with  former  class- 
mates, he  would  perhaps  have  reached  a  level  of  definition  more 
similar  to  an  American  concept  of  self. 

From  childhood,  however,  Japanese  are  taught  that  this  level 
of  self  should  not  be  assertive,  but  rather  considerate  of  the  needs 
of  others;  the  private  emotions  and  perhaps  the  fun-loving,  relaxed 
side  of  Japanese  individuals  are  tolerated  and  even  admired  as  long 
as  these  do  not  interfere  with  the  performance  of  more  public 
responsibilities.  The  proper  performance  of  social  roles  is  neces- 
sary to  the  smooth  functioning  of  society.  Individuals,  aware  of 
private  inner  selves  (and  even  resistance  to  the  very  roles  they  per- 
form), use  a  shifting  scale  of  uchi  and  soto  to  define  themselves  in 
various  situations. 

Family 

The  family  is  the  earliest  locus  of  social  life  for  an  individual 
and  provides  a  model  of  social  organization  for  most  later  encoun- 
ters with  the  wider  world.  Yet,  as  uchi,  the  Japanese  family  does 
not  have  clear  boundaries.  At  times  the  term  family  may  refer  to 
a  nuclear  family  of  parents  and  unmarried  children.  On  other  oc- 
casions it  refers  to  a  line  of  descent,  and  on  still  others  it  refers 
to  the  household  as  a  unit  of  production  or  consumption. 

A  great  variety  of  family  forms  have  existed  historically  in  Japan, 
from  the  matrilocal  customs  of  the  Heian  elite,  which  are  described 
in  Genji  monogatari  (Tale  of  Genji),  to  the  extreme  patrilineality  of 


111 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

the  samurai  class  in  the  feudal  period.  Numerous  family  forms, 
through  which  ran  a  common  belief  in  the  existence  of  the  family- 
household  beyond  the  life  of  its  current  members,  coexisted,  par- 
ticularly in  the  countryside.  Among  the  upper  classes  and  wealth- 
ier merchant  and  artisan  urban  households  of  the  Tokugawa  period, 
the  chonin,  providing  for  household  continuity,  and  if  possible  en- 
riching the  household's  estate,  represented  duty  to  one's  ancestors 
and  appreciation  toward  one's  parents. 

With  the  promulgation  of  the  Domestic  Relations  and  Inheritance 
Law  in  1898,  the  Japanese  government  institutionalized  more  rigid 
family  controls  than  most  people  had  known  in  the  feudal  period. 
Individuals  were  registered  in  an  official  family  registry.  In  the  early 
twentieth  century,  each  family  was  required  to  conform  to  the  ie 
(household)  system,  with  a  multigenerational  household  under  the 
legal  authority  of  a  household  head.  In  establishing  the  ie  system, 
the  government  moved  the  ideology  of  family  in  the  opposite  direc- 
tion of  trends  resulting  from  urbanization  and  industrialization. 
The  ie  system  took  as  its  model  for  the  family  the  Confucian- 
influenced  pattern  of  the  Tokugawa  period  upper  classes.  Authority 
and  responsibility  for  all  members  of  the  ie  lay  legally  with  the  house- 
hold head.  Each  generation  supplied  a  male  and  female  adult,  with 
a  preference  for  first  son  inheritance  and  patrilocal  marriage.  When 
possible,  daughters  were  expected  to  marry  out  and  younger  sons 
to  establish  their  own  households.  Women  could  not  legally  own 
or  control  property  or  select  spouses.  The  ie  system  thus  artifici- 
ally restricted  the  development  of  individualism,  individual  rights, 
women's  rights,  and  the  nuclearization  of  the  family.  It  formal- 
ized patriarchy  and  emphasized  lineal  and  instrumental  rather  than 
conjugal  and  emotional  ties  within  the  family. 

After  World  War  II,  the  Allied  occupation  forces  established  a 
new  family  ideology  based  on  equal  rights  for  women,  equal  in- 
heritance by  all  children,  and  free  choice  of  spouse  and  career.  From 
the  late  1960s,  most  marriages  in  Japan  have  been  based  on  the 
mutual  attraction  of  the  couple  and  not  the  arrangement  of  par- 
ents. Moreover,  arranged  marriages  in  the  1980s  might  have  begun 
with  an  introduction  by  a  relative  or  family  friend,  but  actual  negoti- 
ations did  not  begin  until  all  parties,  including  the  bride  and  groom, 
were  satisfied  with  the  relationship. 

Under  the  ie  system,  only  a  minority  of  households  included  three 
generations  at  a  time,  since  nonsuccessor  sons  (those  who  were  not- 
heirs)  often  set  up  their  own  household.  From  1970  to  1983,  the 
proportion  of  three- generation  households  fell  from  19  percent  to 
15  percent  of  all  households,  while  two- generation  households  con- 
sisting of  a  couple  and  their  unmarried  children  increased  only 


112 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


slightly,  from  41  percent  to  42  percent  of  all  households.  The 
greatest  change  has  been  the  increase  in  couple-only  households 
and  in  elderly  single-person  households. 

Public  opinion  surveys  in  the  late  1980s  seemed  to  confirm  the 
statistical  movement  away  from  the  three- generation  ie  family 
model.  Half  of  the  respondents  did  not  think  that  the  first  son  had 
a  special  role  to  play  in  the  family,  and  nearly  two- thirds  rejected 
the  need  for  adoption  of  a  son  in  order  to  continue  the  family.  Other 
changes,  such  as  an  increase  in  filial  violence  and  school  refusal 
suggest  a  breakdown  of  strong  family  authority. 

Official  statistics,  however,  indicate  that  Japanese  concepts  of 
family  continued  to  diverge  from  those  in  the  United  States  in  the 
1980s.  The  divorce  rate,  although  increasing  slowly,  remained  at 
1.3  per  1,000  marriages  in  1987,  low  by  international  standards. 
Strong  gender  roles  remained  the  cornerstone  of  family  responsi- 
bilities. Most  survey  respondents  said  that  family  life  should  em- 
phasize parent-child  ties  over  husband- wife  relations.  Nearly  80 
percent  of  respondents  in  a  1 986  government  survey  believed  that 
the  ancestral  home  and  family  grave  should  be  carefully  kept  and 
handed  on  to  one's  children.  Over  60  percent  thought  it  best  for 
elderly  parents  to  live  with  one  of  their  children.  This  sense  of  fam- 
ily as  a  unit  that  continued  through  time  was  stronger  among  peo- 
ple who  had  a  livelihood  to  pass  down,  such  as  farmers,  merchants, 
owners  of  small  companies,  and  physicians,  than  among  urban  sal- 
ary and  wage  earners.  Anthropologist  Jane  Bachnik  noted  the  con- 
tinued emphasis  on  continuity  in  the  rural  families  she  studied. 
Uchi  (here,  the  contemporary  family)  were  considered  the  living 
members  of  an  ie,  which  had  no  formal  existence.  Yet,  in  each 
generation,  there  occurred  a  sorting  of  members  into  permanent 
and  temporary  members,  defining  different  levels  of  uchi. 

Various  family  life-styles  exist  side  by  side  in  contemporary 
Japan.  In  many  urban  families,  the  husband  may  commute  to  work 
and  return  late,  having  little  time  with  his  children  except  for  Sun- 
days, a  favorite  day  for  family  outings.  The  wife  might  be  a  "pro- 
fessional housewife,"  with  nearly  total  responsibility  for  raising 
children,  assuring  their  careers  and  marriages,  running  the  house- 
hold, and  managing  the  family  budget.  She  also  has  primary  respon- 
sibility for  maintaining  social  relations  with  the  wider  circles  of 
relatives,  neighbors,  and  acquaintances,  and  for  managing  the  fam- 
ily's reputation.  Her  social  life  remains  separate  from  that  of  her 
husband.  It  is  increasingly  likely  that  in  addition  to  these  family 
responsibilities,  she  would  also  have  a  part-time  job  or  participate 
in  adult  education  or  other  community  activities.  The  closest  emo- 
tional ties  within  such  families  are  between  the  mother  and  children. 


113 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

In  other  families,  particularly  among  the  self-employed,  husband 
and  wife  work  side  by  side  in  a  family  business.  Although  gender- 
based  roles  are  clear  cut,  they  might  not  be  as  rigidly  distinct  as 
in  a  household  where  work  and  family  are  more  separated.  In  such 
families,  fathers  are  more  involved  in  their  children's  development 
because  they  have  more  opportunity  for  interacting  with  them. 

As  women  worked  outside  of  the  home  with  increasing  frequency 
in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  there  was  pressure  on  their  husbands  to 
take  on  more  responsibility  for  housework  and  child  care.  Farm 
families,  who  depended  on  nonfarm  employment  for  most  of  their 
income,  were  also  developing  patterns  of  interaction  different  from 
those  of  previous  generations. 

Neighborhood 

Beyond  the  family,  the  next  group  to  which  children  are  in- 
troduced is  the  neighborhood.  Although  the  loose,  informal  groups 
of  children  who  wandered  through  villages  of  the  past  had  no  coun- 
terpart in  contemporary  heavily  trafficked  city  streets,  neighbor- 
hood playgrounds  and  the  grounds  of  local  shrines  and  temples  are 
sites  where  young  children,  accompanied  by  mothers,  begin  to  learn 
to  get  along  with  others. 

Among  neighbors,  there  is  great  concern  for  face.  In  old  urban 
neighborhoods  or  rural  villages,  families  might  have  been  neigh- 
bors for  generations,  and  thus  expect  relationships  of  assistance 
and  cooperation  to  continue  into  the  future.  In  newer  company 
housing,  neighbors  represent  both  competition  and  stress  at  the 
workplace,  which  cannot  be  expressed.  Extra  care  is  taken  to  main- 
tain proper  relations  while  maximizing  family  privacy.  Participation 
in  neighborhood  activities  is  not  mandatory,  but  nonparticipants 
might  lose  face.  If  a  family  plans  to  stay  in  an  area,  people  feel 
strong  pressures  to  participate  in  public  projects  such  as  neigh- 
borhood cleanups  or  seasonal  festivals.  Concern  for  the  family's 
reputation  is  real  because  background  checks  for  marriage  and  em- 
ployment might  include  asking  neighbors  their  opinions  about  a 
family.  More  positively,  neighbors  become  uchi  for  certain  purposes, 
such  as  local  merchants  providing  personal  services,  physicians 
responding  to  calls  for  minor  ailments  and  emergency  treatment, 
and  neighbors  taking  care  of  children  while  their  mother  goes  out. 

People  who  work  in  the  neighborhood  where  they  live  often  have 
a  different  attitude  from  those  who  spend  most  of  their  waking  hours 
at  distant  workplaces,  creating  differences  in  character  between  the 
central  city  and  the  suburbs.  Central  city  areas,  dominated  by  the 
old  middle  class  of  artisans,  merchants,  and  small  business  own- 
ers, generally  have  more  active  neighborhood  associations  and  other 


114 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


local  groups,  such  as  merchant  associations  and  shrine  associations. 
The  neighborhood  association's  activities  include  public  sanitation 
and  health,  volunteer  firefighting,  disaster  preparedness,  crime 
prevention,  information  exchange,  and  recreational  activities,  par- 
ticularly for  children  and  the  elderly.  In  new  urban  or  suburban 
developments,  local  governments  might  take  a  more  active  role  in 
performing  these  functions.  In  neighborhoods  with  mixtures  of  new 
and  old  middle  class  residents,  it  is  people  with  the  time  and  in- 
terest, most  likely  those  with  businesses  in  the  area,  who  are  ac- 
tive in  neighborhood  affairs.  The  activities  of  women  and  children, 
however,  might  cut  across  such  class  distinctions.  The  emphasis 
on  good  relations  with  neighbors  helps  counteract  the  potential  de- 
personalization of  urban  living.  Working  together  on  community 
projects,  exchanging  information,  and  cooperating  in  community 
rituals,  such  as  festivals,  helps  maintain  a  sense  of  community. 

The  consequences  of  economic  growth  were  examined  more 
closely  by  1980s  consumers,  who  began  to  demand  higher  quality 
social  services,  more  libraries  and  cultural  centers,  greater  access 
to  sports  facilities,  and  more  parkland.  Attention  was  increasingly 
focused  on  the  adverse  effects  of  urban  life  on  families:  modern 
children  were  seen  as  more  demanding  and  less  disciplined  than 
their  forebears,  who  had  experienced  war  and  poverty. 

Despite  these  problems,  urban  life  was  much  safer  and  more  con- 
venient than  in  many  other  countries  in  the  late  twentieth  century. 
In  contrast  to  most  industrialized  nations,  urban  crime  rates  were 
declining.  The  streets  of  Tokyo  were  safe  even  at  night,  and  a  public 
campaign  was  more  likely  to  urge  residents  to  lock  their  doors  than 
to  suggest  they  install  deadbolts.  Public  transportation  was  con- 
gested but  convenient,  clean,  punctual,  and  relatively  inexpensive 
(see  Transportation  and  Communications,  ch.  4).  Complaints  were 
heard,  however,  that  railroad  station  parking  lots  were  too  small 
to  accommodate  all  commuter  bicycles.  In  urban  areas,  houses  were 
close  together;  but  at  the  same  time  shops  were  close  by,  and  house- 
wives could  easily  purchase  fresh  vegetables  and  fish  daily.  Urban 
life  was  made  more  attractive  for  many  by  a  wide  variety  of  cul- 
tural and  sports  activities,  including  the  symphony  orchestra,  the- 
ater, sumo,  professional  baseball,  museums,  and  art  galleries  (see 
The  Arts,  ch.  3). 

Workplace 

Entry  into  the  labor  force  widens  the  circle  of  social  relation- 
ships. For  many  adults,  these  contacts  are  important  sources  of 
friendships  and  resources.  For  men  especially,  the  workplace  is  the 
focus  of  their  social  world.  Many  both  in  and  outside  of  Japan  share 


115 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

an  image  of  the  Japanese  workplace  that  is  based  on  a  lifetime- 
employment  model  used  by  large  companies.  These  employment 
practices  came  about  as  the  result  of  labor  shortage  in  the  1920s, 
when  companies  competed  to  recruit  and  retain  the  best  workers 
by  offering  better  benefits  and  job  security.  By  the  1960s,  em- 
ployment at  a  large  prestigious  company  had  become  the  goal  of 
children  of  the  new  middle  class;  the  pursuit  of  which  required 
mobilization  of  family  resources  and  great  individual  perseverance 
in  order  to  achieve  success  in  the  fiercely  competitive  education 
system. 

Lifetime  employment  referred  not  to  a  worker's  lifetime,  but  to 
the  time  from  school  graduation  until  mandatory  retirement,  in 
1990  at  age  sixty  for  most  men.  Workers  were  recruited  directly 
out  of  school,  and  large  investments  were  made  in  training.  Em- 
ployees were  expected  to  work  hard  and  demonstrate  loyalty  to  the 
firm,  in  exchange  for  some  degree  of  job  security  and  benefits,  such 
as  housing  subsidies,  good  insurance,  the  use  of  recreational  facil- 
ities, and  bonuses  and  pensions.  Wages  began  low,  but  seniority 
was  rewarded  with  promotions  based  on  a  combination  of  senior- 
ity and  ability.  Leadership  was  not  based  on  assertiveness  or  quick 
decision  making,  but  on  the  ability  to  create  consensus,  taking  into 
account  the  needs  of  subordinates.  Surveys  indicated  continued 
preference  for  bosses  who  were  demanding  but  showed  concern 
for  workers'  private  lives  over  less-demanding  bosses  interested  only 
in  performance  on  the  job.  This  system  rewarded  behavior  demon- 
strating identification  with  the  team  effort,  indicated  by  singing 
the  company  song,  not  taking  all  of  one's  vacation  days,  and  shar- 
ing credit  for  accomplishments  with  the  work  group.  Pride  in  one's 
work  was  expressed  through  competition  with  other  parallel  sec- 
tions in  the  company  and  between  one's  company  and  other  com- 
panies in  similar  lines  of  business.  Thus,  individuals  were  motivated 
to  maintain  wa  (harmony)  and  participate  in  group  activities,  not 
only  on  the  job,  but  in  after-hours  socializing  as  well.  The  image 
of  group  loyalty,  however,  might  have  been  more  a  matter  of  ideol- 
ogy than  practice,  especially  for  people  who  did  not  make  it  to  the 
top. 

Every  worker  did  not  enjoy  the  benefits  of  such  employment  prac- 
tices and  work  environments  in  the  1980s.  Although  64  percent 
of  households  in  1985  depended  on  wages  or  salaries  for  most  of 
their  income,  most  of  these  workers  were  employed  by  small  and 
medium- sized  firms  that  could  not  afford  the  benefits  or  achieve 
the  successes  of  the  large  companies,  despite  the  best  intentions 
of  owners.  Even  in  the  large  corporations,  distinctions  between  per- 
manent and  temporary  employees  made  many  workers,  often 


116 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


women,  ineligible  for  benefits  and  promotions.  These  workers  were 
also  the  first  to  be  laid  off  in  difficult  business  conditions.  Japan 
scholar  Dorinne  K.  Kondo  compares  the  status  of  permanent  and 
temporary  workers  with  Bachnik's  distinctions  between  permanent 
and  temporary  members  of  an  ie,  creating  degrees  of  inside  and 
outside  within  a  firm.  Traditions  of  entrepreneurship  and  of  in- 
heritance of  the  means  of  livelihood  continued  among  merchants, 
artisans,  farmers,  and  fishermen,  still  nearly  20  percent  of  the  work 
force  in  1985.  These  workers  gave  up  security  for  autonomy,  and 
when  economically  necessary,  supplemented  household  income  with 
wage  employment.  Traditionally,  such  businesses  used  unpaid  fam- 
ily labor,  but  in  1990  wives  or  even  husbands  were  likely  to  go 
off  to  work  in  factories  or  offices  and  leave  spouses  or  retired  par- 
ents to  work  the  farm  or  mind  the  shop.  Policies  of  decentraliza- 
tion provided  factory  jobs  locally  for  families  that  farmed  part-time; 
on  the  other  hand,  unemployment  created  by  deindustrialization 
affected  rural  as  well  as  urban  workers.  Unemployment  was  low 
in  Japan  compared  to  other  industrialized  nations  (less  than  3  per- 
cent through  the  late  1980s),  but  an  estimated  400,000  day  laborers 
shared  none  of  the  security  or  affluence  enjoyed  by  those  employees 
with  lifetime-employment  benefits. 

Although  Japanese  workers  are  known  worldwide  for  their  hard 
work  and  dedication  to  their  firms,  more  than  50  percent  of  respon- 
dents of  a  1988  government  survey  said  that  they  would  rather  have 
more  free  time  than  increased  income.  The  proportion  preferring 
free  time  to  increased  income  was  greater  among  professionals,  su- 
pervisors, and  white-collar  workers.  There  was  also  evidence  of 
increased  interfirm  mobility  among  some  types  of  workers  in  the 
late  1980s,  as  a  result  of  a  labor  shortage  and  changing  attitudes 
toward  work  among  young  people. 

Popular  Culture 

Japanese  popular  culture  not  only  reflects  the  attitudes  and  con- 
cerns of  the  present,  but  also  provides  a  link  to  the  past.  Popular 
films,  television  programs,  comics,  and  music  all  developed  from 
older  artistic  and  literary  traditions,  and  many  of  their  themes  and 
styles  of  presentation  can  be  traced  to  traditional  art  forms.  Con- 
temporary forms  of  popular  culture,  like  the  traditional  forms, 
provide  not  only  entertainment,  but  also  an  escape  for  the  con- 
temporary Japanese  from  the  problems  of  an  industrial  world. 
When  asked  how  they  spent  their  leisure  time,  80  percent  of  a  sam- 
ple of  men  and  women  surveyed  by  the  government  in  1 986  aver- 
aged about  two  and  one-half  hours  per  weekday  watching  television, 
listening  to  the  radio,  and  reading  newspapers  or  magazines.  Some 


117 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


16  percent  spent  an  average  of  two  and  one-quarter  hours  a  day 
engaged  in  hobbies  or  amusements.  Others  spent  leisure  time  par- 
ticipating in  sports,  socializing,  and  personal  study.  Teenagers  and 
retired  people  reported  more  time  spent  on  all  of  these  activities 
than  other  groups. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  family  was  the  focus  of  leisure  activities, 
such  as  excursions  to  parks  or  shopping  districts.  Although  Japan 
is  often  thought  of  as  a  hard-working  society  with  little  time  for 
pleasure,  the  Japanese  seek  entertainment  wherever  they  can.  In 
the  1980s,  it  was  common  to  see  Japanese  commuters  riding  the 
train  to  work,  enjoying  their  favorite  comic  book  or  listening 
through  earphones  to  the  latest  in  popular  music  on  cassette  players. 

In  the  mid-1980s,  Japan  had  about  71  million  television  sets  in 
use,  and  television  was  the  main  source  of  home  entertainment  and 
information  for  most  of  the  population.  The  Japanese  had  a  wide 
variety  of  programs  to  choose  from,  including  the  various  dramas 
(police,  crime,  home,  and  samurai),  cartoons,  news,  and  game, 
quiz,  and  sports  shows  provided  by  the  Japan  Broadcasting  Cor- 
poration (Nippon  Hoso  Kyokai — NHK)  general  station,  the  NHK 
educational  station,  and  numerous  commercial  and  independent 
stations.  The  violence  of  the  samurai  and  police  dramas  and  the 
scatological  humor  of  the  cartoons  drew  criticism  from  mothers  and 
commentators.  Characters  in  dramas  and  cartoons  often  reflected 
racial  and  gender  stereotypes.  Women  news  anchors  were  not  given 
equal  exposure  in  news  broadcasts,  and  few  women  were  portrayed 
on  television  in  high  career  positions. 

Individuals  also  could  choose  from  a  variety  of  types  of  popular 
entertainment.  There  was  a  large  selection  of  musical  tapes,  films, 
television  programs,  and  the  products  of  a  huge  comic  book  in- 
dustry, among  other  forms  of  entertainment,  from  which  to  choose 
in  the  late  1980s  (see  Performing  Arts;  Literature;  and  Films  and 
Television,  ch.  3). 

Gender  Stratification  and  the  Lives  of  Women 

Gender  has  been  an  important  principle  of  stratification  through- 
out Japanese  history,  but  the  cultural  elaboration  of  gender  differ- 
ences has  varied  over  time  and  among  different  social  classes.  In 
the  twelfth  century,  for  example,  women  could  inherit  property 
in  their  own  names  and  manage  it  by  themselves.  Later,  under 
feudal  governments,  the  status  of  women  declined.  Peasant  women 
continued  to  have  de  facto  freedom  of  movement  and  decision- 
making power,  but  upper-class  women's  lives  were  subject  to  the 
patrilineal  and  patriarchal  ideology  supported  by  the  government 
as  part  of  its  efforts  at  social  control.  With  early  industrialization,

young  women  participated  in  factory  work  under  exploitative  and 
unhealthy  working  conditions  without  gaining  personal  autonomy. 
In  the  Meiji  period,  industrialization  and  urbanization  lessened  the 
authority  of  fathers  and  husbands,  but  at  the  same  time  the  Meiji 
Civil  Code  denied  women  legal  rights  and  subjugated  them  to  the 
will  of  household  heads.  Peasant  women  were  less  affected  by  the 
institutionalization  of  this  trend,  but  it  gradually  spread  even  to  re- 
mote areas.  In  the  1930s  and  1940s,  the  government  encouraged 
the  formation  of  women's  associations,  applauded  high  fertility,  and 
regarded  motherhood  as  a  patriotic  duty  to  the  Japanese  Empire. 

After  World  War  II,  the  legal  position  of  women  was  redefined 
by  the  occupation  authorities,  who  included  an  equal  rights  clause 
in  the  1947  Constitution  and  the  revised  Civil  Code  of  1948.  In- 
dividual rights  were  given  precedence  over  obligation  to  family. 
Women  as  well  as  men  were  guaranteed  the  right  to  choose  spouses 
and  occupations,  to  inherit  and  own  property  in  their  own  names, 
to  initiate  divorce,  and  to  retain  custody  of  their  children.  Women 
were  given  the  right  to  vote  in  1946.  Other  postwar  reforms  opened 
education  institutions  to  women  and  required  that  women  receive 
equal  pay  for  equal  work.  In  1986,  an  Equal  Employment  Oppor- 
tunity Law  took  effect.  Legally,  few  barriers  to  women's  equal  par- 
ticipation in  the  life  of  society  remained. 

Gender  inequality,  however,  continued  in  family  life,  the  work- 
place, and  popular  values.  The  notion  expressed  in  the  proverbial 
phrase  "good  wife,  wise  mother,"  continued  to  influence  beliefs 
about  gender  roles.  Most  women  may  not  have  been  able  to  re- 
alize that  ideal,  but  many  believed  that  it  was  in  their  own,  their 
children's,  and  society's  best  interests  that  they  stay  home  to  de- 
vote themselves  to  their  children,  at  least  while  the  children  were 
young.  Many  women  found  satisfaction  in  family  life  and  in  the 
accomplishments  of  their  children,  gaining  a  sense  of  fulfillment 
from  doing  good  jobs  as  household  managers  and  mothers.  In  most 
households,  women  were  responsible  for  their  family  budgets  and 
made  independent  decisions  about  the  education,  careers,  and  life- 
styles of  their  families.  On  the  other  hand,  women  took  the  social 
blame  for  problems  of  family  members. 

Women's  educational  opportunities  have  increased  in  the  twen- 
tieth century.  Among  new  workers  in  1989,  37  percent  of  women 
had  received  education  beyond  upper- secondary  school,  compared 
with  43  percent  of  men,  but  most  women  had  received  their  post- 
secondary  education  in  junior  colleges  and  technical  schools  rather 
than  in  universities  and  graduate  schools  (see  Higher  Education, 
ch.  3). 

Forty- seven  percent  of  all  women  over  fifteen  years  of  age 
participated  in  the  paid  labor  force  in  1987.  Two  major  changes 


120 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


in  the  female  work  force  were  under  way.  The  first  was  a  move 
away  from  household-based  employment.  Peasant  women  and  those 
from  merchant  and  artisan  families  had  always  worked.  With  self- 
employment  becoming  less  common,  however,  the  more  usual  pat- 
tern was  separation  of  home  and  workplace,  creating  new  problems 
of  child  care,  care  of  the  elderly,  and  housekeeping  responsibili- 
ties. The  second  major  change  was  the  increased  participation  of 
married  women  in  the  labor  force.  In  the  1950s,  most  women  em- 
ployees were  young  and  single;  62  percent  of  the  female  labor  force 
in  1960  had  never  been  married.  In  1987,  66  percent  of  the  fe- 
male labor  force  was  married,  and  only  23  percent  was  made  up 
women  who  had  never  married.  Some  women  continued  working 
after  marriage,  most  often  in  professional  and  government  jobs, 
but  their  numbers  were  small.  Others  started  their  own  businesses, 
or  took  over  family  businesses.  More  commonly,  women  left  paid 
labor  after  marriage,  then  returned  after  their  youngest  children 
were  in  school.  These  middle-age  recruits  generally  took  low-paying, 
part-time  service  or  factory  jobs.  They  continued  to  have  nearly 
total  responsibility  for  home  and  children,  and  often  justified  their 
employment  as  an  extension  of  their  responsibilities  for  the  care 
of  their  families.  Despite  legal  support  for  equality  and  some  im- 
provement in  their  status,  married  women  understood  that  their 
husbands'  jobs  demanded  long  hours  and  extreme  commitment. 
Because  women  earned  an  average  of  only  60  percent  as  much  as 
men,  most  did  not  find  it  advantageous  to  take  full-time,  respon- 
sible jobs  after  marriage,  if  doing  so  left  no  one  to  manage  the  house- 
hold and  care  for  children  (see  Working  Women,  ch.  4). 

Yet  women's  status  in  the  labor  force  was  changing  in  the  late 
1980s,  most  likely  as  a  result  of  changes  brought  about  by  the  aging 
of  the  population.  Longer  life  expectancies,  smaller  families  and 
bunched  births,  and  lowered  expectations  of  being  cared  for  in  old 
age  by  their  children  have  all  led  women  to  participate  more  fully 
in  the  labor  force.  At  the  same  time,  service  job  opportunities  in 
the  postindustrial  economy  expanded,  and  there  were  fewer  new 
male  graduates  to  fill  them. 

Some  of  the  same  demographic  factors — low  birth  rates  and  high 
life  expectancies — also  changed  workplace  demands  on  husbands. 
For  example,  men  recognized  their  need  for  a  different  kind  of  rela- 
tionship with  their  wives  in  anticipation  of  long  post-retirement 
periods. 

Age  Stratification  and  the  Elderly 

Another  key  principle  in  the  stratification  of  Japanese  society 
is  age.  "Acting  one's  age"  may  be  more  important  in  Japan  than 


121 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

in  some  other  societies,  resulting  in  relatively  narrow  age  ranges 
for  such  life  cycle  events  as  university  education,  first  job,  or  mar- 
riage. This  pattern  fits  with  the  value  placed  on  playing  social  roles 
appropriately. 

Old  age  ideally  represents  a  time  of  relaxation  of  social  obliga- 
tions, assisting  with  the  family  farm  or  business  without  carrying 
the  main  responsibility,  socializing,  and  receiving  respectful  care 
from  family  and  esteem  from  the  community.  In  the  late  1980s, 
high  (although  declining)  rates  of  suicide  among  older  people  and 
the  continued  existence  of  temples  where  one  could  pray  for  quick 
death  indicated  that  this  ideal  was  not  always  fulfilled.  Japan  has 
a  national  holiday  called  Respect  for  the  Aged  Day,  but  for  most 
people  it  is  merely  another  day  for  picnics  or  an  occasion  when 
the  commuter  trains  run  on  holiday  schedules.  True  respect  for 
the  elderly  may  be  questioned  when  buses  and  trains  carry  signs 
above  specially  reserved  seats  to  remind  people  to  give  up  their 
seats  for  elderly  riders.  Although  the  elderly  might  not  have  been 
accorded  a  generalized  respect  based  on  age,  many  older  Japanese 
continued  to  live  full  lives  that  included  gainful  employment  and 
close  relationships  with  adult  children. 

Although  the  standard  retirement  age  in  Japan  throughout  most 
of  the  postwar  period  was  fifty-five,  people  aged  sixty-five  and  over 
in  Japan  were  more  likely  to  work  than  in  any  other  developed 
country  in  the  1980s.  In  1987,  36  percent  of  men  and  15  percent 
of  women  in  this  age-group  were  in  the  labor  force.  With  better 
pension  benefits  and  decreased  opportunities  for  agricultural  or 
other  self-employed  work,  however,  labor  force  participation  by 
the  elderly  has  been  decreasing  since  1960.  In  1986,  90  percent 
of  Japanese  surveyed  said  that  they  wished  to  continue  working 
after  age  sixty-five.  They  indicated  both  financial  and  health  rea- 
sons for  this  choice.  Other  factors,  such  as  a  strong  work  ethic  and 
the  centering  of  men's  social  ties  around  the  workplace,  may  also 
be  relevant.  Employment  was  not  always  available,  however,  and 
men  and  women  who  worked  after  retirement  usually  took  sub- 
stantial cuts  in  salary  and  prestige.  Between  1981  and  1986,  the 
proportion  of  people  sixty  and  over  who  reported  that  a  public  pen- 
sion was  their  major  source  of  income  increased  from  35  percent 
to  53  percent,  while  those  relying  most  on  earnings  for  income  fell 
from  31  to  25  percent,  and  those  relying  on  children  decreased  from 
16  to  9  percent  (see  Aging  and  Retirement  of  the  Labor  Force, 
ch.  4). 

As  the  1990s  approached,  there  was  a  major  trend  toward  the 
elderly  maintaining  separate  households  rather  than  co-residing  with 
the  families  of  adult  children.  The  proportion  living  with  children 


122 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


decreased  from  77  percent  in  1970  to  65  percent  in  1985,  although 
this  rate  was  still  much  higher  than  in  other  industrialized  coun- 
tries. The  number  of  elderly  living  in  Japan's  retirement  or  nurs- 
ing homes  also  increased  from  around  75,000  in  1970  to  more  than 
216,000  in  1987;  still,  this  group  was  a  small  portion  of  the  total 
elderly  population.  People  living  alone  or  only  with  spouses  con- 
stituted 32  percent  of  the  sixty-five-and-over  group.  Less  than  half 
of  those  responding  to  a  government  survey  believed  that  it  was 
the  duty  of  the  eldest  son  to  care  for  parents,  but  63  percent  re- 
plied that  it  was  natural  for  children  to  take  care  of  their  elderly 
parents.  The  motive  of  co-residence  seems  to  have  changed,  from 
being  the  expected  arrangement  of  an  agricultural  society  to  be- 
ing an  option  for  coping  with  circumstances  such  as  illness  or  widow- 
hood in  a  postindustrial  society. 

In  the  late  1980s,  concern  for  the  health  of  the  aged  continued 
to  receive  a  great  deal  of  attention,  and  nearly  free  medical  care 
for  people  over  seventy  years  of  age  was  a  national  policy.  Respon- 
sibility for  the  care  of  the  aged,  bedridden,  or  senile,  however,  still 
devolved  mainly  on  family  members,  usually  daughters-in-law. 

Health  Care  and  Social  Welfare 

While  most  postwar  Japanese  relied  on  personal  savings  and  the 
support  of  family,  both  the  government  and  private  companies  have 
long  provided  assistance  for  the  ill  or  otherwise  disabled,  and  for 
the  old.  Beginning  in  the  1920s,  the  government  enacted  a  series 
of  welfare  programs,  based  mainly  on  European  models,  to  pro- 
vide medical  care  and  financial  support.  Government  expenditures 
for  all  forms  of  social  welfare  increased  from  6  percent  of  national 
income  in  the  early  1970s  to  18  percent  in  1989.  The  mixtures  of 
public  and  private  funding  have  created  complex  pension  and  in- 
surance systems. 

Health  Care 

A  person  who  becomes  ill  in  Japan  has  a  number  of  options. 
One  may  visit  a  Buddhist  temple  or  Shinto  shrine,  or  send  a  fam- 
ily member  in  their  place.  There  are  numerous  folk  remedies,  in- 
cluding hot  springs  baths  and  chemical  and  herbal  over-the-counter 
medications.  A  person  may  seek  the  assistance  of  traditional  heal- 
ers, such  as  herbalists,  masseurs,  and  acupuncturists.  However, 
Western  biomedicine  has  dominated  Japanese  medical  care  in  the 
postwar  period. 

Public  health  services,  including  free  screening  examinations  for 
particular  diseases,  prenatal  care,  and  infectious  disease  control 
were  provided  by  national  and  local  governments.  Payment  for 


123 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


personal  medical  services  was  offered  through  a  universal  medical 
insurance  system  that  provided  relative  equality  of  access,  with  fees 
set  by  a  government  committee.  People  without  insurance  through 
employers  could  participate  in  a  national  health  insurance  program 
administered  by  local  governments.  Since  1973,  all  elderly  persons 
were  covered  by  government-sponsored  insurance.  Patients  were 
free  to  select  physicians  or  facilities  of  their  choice. 

There  were  more  than  1,000  mental  hospitals,  8,700  general 
hospitals,  and  1 ,000  comprehensive  hospitals  with  a  total  capacity 
of  1.5  million  beds.  Hospitals  provided  both  out-patient  and  in- 
patient care.  In  addition,  79,000  clinics  offered  primarily  out-patient 
services,  and  there  were  48,000  dental  clinics.  Most  physicians  and 
hospitals  sold  medicine  directly  to  patients,  but  there  were  36,000 
pharmacies  where  patients  could  purchase  synthetic  or  herbal  medi- 
cation. 

National  health  expenditures  rose  from  about  ¥1  trillion  (for 
value  of  the  yen — see  Glossary)  in  1965  to  over  ¥18  trillion  in  1987, 
or  from  slightly  more  than  5  percent  to  almost  7  percent  of  Japan's 
national  income.  In  addition  to  cost  control  problems,  the  system 
was  troubled  with  excessive  paperwork,  long  waits  to  see  physi- 
cians, assembly-line  care  for  out-patients  (because  few  facilities  made 
appointments),  overmedication,  and  abuse  of  the  system  because 
of  low  out-of-pocket  costs  to  patients.  Another  problem  in  the  late 
1980s  was  an  uneven  distribution  of  health  personnel,  with  cities 
favored  over  rural  areas. 

In  the  late  1980s,  government  and  professional  circles  were  con- 
sidering changing  the  system  so  that  primary,  secondary,  and  ter- 
tiary levels  of  care  would  be  clearly  distinguished  within  each 
geographical  region,  and  facilities  might  be  designated  by  level  of 
care,  with  referrals  required  to  obtain  more  complex  care.  Policy 
makers  and  administrators  also  recognized  the  need  to  unify  the 
various  insurance  systems  and  control  costs. 

There  were  nearly  191,400  physicians,  66,800  dentists,  and 
333,000  nurses,  plus  more  than  200,000  people  licensed  to  practice 
massage,  acupuncture,  moxibustion,  and  other  East  Asian  therapeu- 
tic methods.  Since  around  1900,  Chinese-style  herbalists  have  been 
required  to  be  licensed  medical  doctors.  Training  was  professional- 
ized and,  except  for  East  Asian  healers,  was  based  on  a  biomedical 
model  of  disease.  However,  the  practice  of  biomedicine  was  in- 
fluenced as  well  by  Japanese  social  organization  and  cultural  ex- 
pectations concerning  education,  the  organization  of  the  workplace, 
and  social  relations  of  status  and  dependency,  decision-making  styles, 
and  ideas  about  the  human  body,  causes  of  illness,  gender,  individu- 
alism, and  privacy.  Anthropologist  Emiko  Ohnuki-Tierney  notes 


124 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


that  "daily  hygienic  behavior  and  its  underlying  concepts,  which 
are  perceived  and  expressed  in  terms  of  biomedical  germ  theory, 
in  fact  are  directly  tied  to  the  basic  Japanese  symbolic  structure." 

Although  the  number  of  cases  remained  small  by  international 
standards,  public  health  officials  were  concerned  in  the  late  1980s 
about  the  worldwide  epidemic  of  acquired  immune  deficiency  syn- 
drome (AIDS).  The  first  confirmed  case  of  AIDS  in  Japan  was 
reported  in  1985.  By  August  1989,  there  were  108  confirmed  cases 
and  between  1,000  and  2,500  others  infected  with  the  virus.  Offi- 
cials anticipated  a  fourfold  increase  by  1992.  Japanese  statistics  on 
patterns  of  transmission  of  the  disease  differ  greatly  from  those  of 
other  countries.  Fifty-eight  percent  of  AIDS  patients  were  hemo- 
philiacs, who  were  infected  with  the  AIDS  virus  by  receiving  tainted 
imported  blood  products.  Another  29  percent  were  homosexual  and 
the  remaining  13  percent  were  infected  through  heterosexual  in- 
tercourse. While  frightened  by  the  deadliness  of  the  disease  yet  sym- 
pathetic to  the  plight  of  hemophiliac  AIDS  patients,  most  Japanese 
were  unconcerned  with  contracting  AIDS  themselves.  Various  levels 
of  government  responded  to  the  introduction  of  AIDS  into  the  het- 
erosexual population  by  establishing  government  committees,  man- 
dating AIDS  education,  and  advising  testing  for  the  general  public 
without  targeting  special  groups.  A  fund,  underwritten  by  phar- 
maceutical companies  that  distributed  imported  blood  products, 
was  established  in  1988  to  provide  financial  compensation  for  AIDS 
patients. 

Social  Welfare 

The  futures  of  Japan's  health  and  welfare  systems  in  1990  were 
being  shaped  by  the  rapid  aging  of  the  population.  Medical  insur- 
ance, health  care  for  the  elderly,  and  public  health  expenses  con- 
stituted about  60  percent  of  social  welfare  and  social  security  costs 
in  1975,  while  government  pensions  accounted  for  20  percent.  By 
the  early  1980s,  pensions  accounted  for  nearly  50  percent  of  social 
welfare  and  social  security  expenditures  because  people  were  liv- 
ing longer  after  retirement.  A  fourfold  increase  in  workers'  indi- 
vidual contributions  was  projected  by  the  twenty-first  century. 

A  major  revision  in  the  public  pension  system  in  1986  unified 
several  former  plans  into  a  single  Employee  Pension  Insurance  Plan. 
In  addition  to  merging  the  former  plans,  the  1986  reform  attempted 
to  reduce  benefits  to  hold  down  increases  in  worker  contribution 
rates.  It  also  established  the  right  of  women  who  did  not  work  out- 
side the  home  to  pension  benefits  of  their  own,  not  only  as  a  de- 
pendent of  a  worker.  Everyone  aged  between  twenty  and  sixty  was 
a  compulsory  member  of  this  Employee  Pension  Insurance  Plan.

Despite  complaints  that  these  pensions  amounted  to  little  more 
than  "spending  money,"  an  increasing  number  of  people  plan- 
ning for  their  retirement  counted  on  them  as  an  important  source 
of  income.  Benefits  increased  so  that  the  basic  monthly  pension 
was  about  US$420  in  1987,  with  future  payments  adjusted  to  the 
consumer  price  index.  Forty  percent  of  elderly  households  in  1985 
depended  on  various  types  of  annuities  and  pensions  as  their  only 
sources  of  income. 

Some  people  were  also  eligible  for  corporate  retirement  al- 
lowances. About  90  percent  of  firms  with  thirty  or  more  employees 
gave  retirement  allowances  in  the  late  1980s  frequently  as  lump 
sum  payments,  but  increasingly  often  in  the  form  of  annuities. 

Japan  also  had  public  assistance  programs  benefiting  about  1 
percent  of  the  population.  About  33  percent  of  recipients  were  el- 
derly people,  about  45  percent  were  households  with  sick  or  dis- 
abled members,  about  14  percent  were  fatherless  families,  and  about 
8  percent  were  in  other  categories. 

Japanese  often  claim  to  outsiders  that  their  society  is  homogene- 
ous. By  world  standards,  the  Japanese  enjoy  a  high  standard  of 
living,  and  nearly  90  percent  of  the  population  consider  themselves 
part  of  the  middle  class.  Most  people  express  satisfaction  with  their 
lives  and  take  great  pride  in  being  Japanese  and  in  their  country's 
status  as  an  economic  power  on  a  par  with  the  United  States  and 
Western  Europe.  In  folk  crafts  and  in  right-wing  politics,  in  the 
new  religions  and  in  international  management,  the  Japanese  have 
turned  to  their  past  to  interpret  the  present.  In  doing  so,  however, 
they  may  be  reconstructing  history  as  a  common  set  of  beliefs  and 
practices  that  make  the  country  look  more  homogeneous  than  it  is. 

In  a  society  that  values  outward  conformity,  individuals  may 
appear  to  take  a  back  seat  to  the  needs  of  the  group.  Yet  it  is  in- 
dividuals who  create  for  themselves  a  variety  of  life-styles.  They 
are  constrained  in  their  choices  by  age,  gender,  life  experiences, 
and  other  factors,  but  they  draw  from  a  rich  cultural  repertoire 
of  past  and  present  through  which  the  wider  social  world  of  fami- 
lies, neighborhoods,  and  institutions  gives  meaning  to  their  lives. 
As  Japan  set  out  to  internationalize  itself  in  the  1990s,  the  iden- 
tification of  inherent  Japanese  qualities  took  on  new  significance, 
and  the  ideology  of  homogeneity  sometimes  masked  individual  de- 
cisions and  life-styles  of  postindustrial  Japan.

Chapter  3.  Education  and  the  Arts 


Artist's  rendition  of Great  Wave  off  the  Coast  of  Ka.na.gaw a.,  from  the 
series  Thirty-six  Views  of  Mount  Fuji  by  ukiyo-e  artist  Hokusai 
Katsushika  (1760-1849) 


JAPANESE  CULTURAL  VALUES  are  deeply  imbedded  in  the 
country's  richly  varied,  ancient  past.  Rooted  in  the  native  religion 
of  Shinto  (Way  of  the  Gods),  these  values  are  also  heavily  indebted 
to  the  continental  influences  of  Buddhism  and  Confucianism.  In 
Shinto,  gods  permeate  the  universe  and  are  perceived  as  embodied 
in  specific  places,  such  as  sacred  Mount  Fuji  and  the  Nachi  Falls, 
or  as  tutelary  spirits  of  rocks  and  trees.  Therefore,  a  reverence  for 
nature  and  admiration  for  particular  scenic  places  are  pervasive 
in  Japanese  art,  echoed  in  literary  descriptions,  and  expressed  in 
architectural  concepts  that  remove  walls  to  allow  the  outside  in  and 
in  avant-garde  smoke  sculptures,  which  recreate  mists.  Shinto  con- 
cepts of  ritual  cleanliness,  purification,  and  renewal  have  played 
a  role  in  preserving  the  forms  of  ancient  shrines  like  that  at  Ise 
and  have  nurtured  handicrafts.  They  also  have  shaped  some  fu- 
nereal practices,  for  example,  the  clay  sculptures  or  haniwa  in  the 
Kofun  period  (ca.  A.D.  300-710),  which  provided  the  first  real 
likeness  of  the  ancient  Japanese. 

Buddhist  thought  was  fundamental  to  the  formulation  of  most 
of  Japan's  arts,  blending  and  absorbing  elements  from  the  proto- 
historic  Shinto.  Basic  to  Buddhist  thought  is  the  comprehension 
of  the  universe  as  in  constant  flux,  which  results  in  emphasis  on 
the  idea  that  all  living  things  perish  or  are  transformed  in  the  chain 
of  existence.  From  this  view  comes  a  feeling  for  ''the  poignancy 
of  things"  {mono  no  aware),  a  frequent  element  in  literature  begin- 
ning in  the  Heian  period  (794-1185).  Cherry  blossoms  are  ap- 
preciated for  their  short-lived  beauty,  which  symbolizes  the  samurai 
ideal  of  a  brilliant  life  with  a  sudden,  dramatic  end.  Zen  Buddhism 
affirms  the  values  of  rustic  simplicity  and  finding  pleasure  in  the 
ordinary  or  minimal;  it  stresses  austerity,  simplicity,  and  brevity 
in  all  things  and  a  life  of  solitude  and  contemplation,  ideas  which, 
together  with  Zen  teaching  devices,  found  expression  in  the  tea 
ceremony,  short  poems,  spontaneous  ink  paintings,  and  medita- 
tion gardens. 

Chinese  artistic  forms  and  philosophical  concepts  have  been  var- 
iously integrated  and  modified  over  the  centuries  by  the  Japanese. 
Confucianism  glorifies  the  cultivation  of  wisdom:  the  scholarly  life 
is  its  ideal,  as  are  the  virtues  of  ethical  behavior,  sincerity,  and 
a  desire  for  social  harmony.  All  these  elements  were  embodied  in 
the  gentleman- scholar  and  his  successors,  the  teacher-scholar  and 


131 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

the  artist-writer,  whose  proficiency  in  language  and  use  of  the  brush 
made  literature  and  calligraphy  the  most  admired  art  forms. 

Japanese  children  are  taught  a  reverence  for  learning  and  trained 
in  the  traditional  arts  both  within  the  school  system  and  outside. 
Instruction  in  music,  calligraphy,  flower  arrangement,  and  the  tea 
ritual  may  begin  at  home,  but  soon  the  child  studies  with  a  skilled 
practitioner.  Only  the  martial  arts,  such  as  judo  or  Japanese  fenc- 
ing (kendo),  are  generally  limited  to  men.  Men  often  practice  the 
other  arts  as  well.  Such  early  introduction  to  and  widespread  par- 
ticipation in  different  expressions  of  Japanese  heritage  lead  to  sup- 
port for  traditional  cultural  values  and  the  appreciation  throughout 
society  of  artistic  qualities. 

Education 

Many  of  the  historical  and  cultural  characteristics  that  shape 
Japanese  arts  shape  its  education  as  well.  Japanese  tradition  stresses 
respect  for  society  and  the  established  order  and  prizes  group  goals 
above  individual  interests.  In  the  early  1990s,  schooling  empha- 
sized in  addition  diligence,  self-criticism,  and  well-organized  study 
habits.  More  generally,  the  belief  was  ingrained  that  hard  work 
and  perseverance  would  yield  success  in  life.  Much  of  official  school 
life  was  devoted  directly  or  indirectly  to  teaching  correct  attitudes 
and  moral  values  and  to  developing  character,  with  the  aim  of  creat- 
ing a  citizenry  that  was  both  literate  and  attuned  to  the  basic  values 
of  culture  and  society. 

At  the  same  time,  the  academic  achievement  of  Japanese  students 
was  extremely  high  by  international  standards.  Japanese  children 
consistentiy  ranked  at  or  near  the  top  in  successive  international  tests 
of  mathematics.  The  system  was  characterized  by  high  enrollment 
and  retention  rates  throughout.  An  entrance  examination  system, 
particularly  important  at  the  college  level,  exerted  strong  influences 
throughout  the  entire  system.  The  structure  did  not  consist  exclu- 
sively of  government- sponsored,  formal  official  education  institu- 
tions. Private  education  also  formed  an  important  part  of  the 
educational  landscape,  and  the  role  of  schools  outside  the  official 
school  system  could  not  be  ignored. 

A  majority  of  children  began  their  education  by  attending 
preschool,  although  it  was  not  part  of  the  official  system.  The  offi- 
cial structure  in  the  early  1990s  provided  compulsory  free  school- 
ing and  a  sound  and  balanced  education  to  virtually  all  children 
from  grade  one  through  grade  nine.  Upper- secondary  school,  from 
grades  ten  through  twelve,  though  also  not  compulsory,  attracted 
about  94  percent  of  those  who  completed  lower- secondary  school. 
About  one-third  of  all  Japanese  upper- secondary  school  graduates

Education  and  the  Arts 


advanced  to  postsecondary  education — to  full  four-year  universi- 
ties, two-year  junior  colleges,  or  to  other  institutions. 

Japan  in  the  early  1990s  remained  a  highly  education-minded 
society.  Education  was  esteemed,  and  educational  achievement  was 
often  the  prerequisite  for  success  in  work  and  in  society  at  large. 

Historical  Background 

Japan  has  had  relations  with  other  cultures  since  the  dawn  of 
its  history  (see  Early  Developments,  ch.  1).  Foreign  civilizations 
have  often  provided  new  ideas  for  the  development  of  Japan's  own 
culture.  Chinese  teachings  and  ideas,  for  example,  flowed  into  Japan 
from  the  sixth  to  ninth  centuries.  Along  with  the  introduction  of 
Buddhism  came  the  Chinese  system  of  writing  and  its  literary  tra- 
dition, and  Confucianism  (see  Religious  and  Philosophical  Tradi- 
tions, ch.  2). 

By  the  ninth  century,  Kyoto,  the  imperial  capital,  had  five  in- 
stitutions of  higher  learning,  and  during  the  remainder  of  the  Heian 
period  (794-1185),  other  schools  were  established  by  the  nobility 
and  the  imperial  court.  During  the  medieval  period  (1185-1600), 
Zen  Buddhist  monasteries  were  especially  important  centers  of 
learning,  and  the  Ashikaga  School  (Ashikaga  Gakko)  flourished 
in  the  fifteenth  century  as  a  center  of  higher  learning. 

In  the  sixteenth  and  early  seventeenth  centuries,  Japan  ex- 
perienced intense  contact  with  the  major  European  powers.  Jesuit 
missionaries,  who  accompanied  Portuguese  traders,  proselytized 
Christianity,  opening  a  number  of  religious  schools.  Japanese  stu- 
dents thus  began  to  study  Latin  and  Western  music,  as  well  as  their 
own  language. 

By  1603  Japan  had  been  reunified  by  the  Tokugawa  regime,  and 
by  1640  foreigners  had  been  ordered  out  of  Japan,  Christianity 
banned,  and  virtually  all  foreign  contact  prohibited.  The  nation 
then  entered  a  period  of  isolation  and  relative  domestic  tranquil- 
ity, which  was  to  last  200  years.  When  the  Tokugawa  period  began, 
few  common  people  in  Japan  could  read  or  write.  By  the  period's 
end,  learning  had  become  widespread.  Tokugawa  education  left 
a  valuable  legacy:  an  increasingly  literate  populace,  a  meritocra- 
tic ideology,  and  an  emphasis  on  discipline  and  competent  perfor- 
mance. Under  subsequent  Meiji  leadership,  this  foundation  would 
facilitate  Japan's  rapid  transition  from  feudal  country  to  modern 
nation  (see  Tokugawa  Period,  1600-1867,  ch.  1). 

During  the  Tokugawa  period,  the  role  of  many  of  the  bushi,  or 
samurai,  changed  from  warrior  to  administrator,  and  as  a  conse- 
quence, their  formal  education  and  their  literacy  increased  propor- 
tionally. Samurai  curricula  stressed  morality  and  included  both 


133 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

military  and  literary  studies.  Confucian  classics  were  memorized, 
and  their  reading  and  recitation  were  common  methods  of  study. 
Arithmetic  and  calligraphy  were  also  studied.  Most  samurai  at- 
tended schools  sponsored  by  their  han  (domains),  and  by  the  time 
of  the  Meiji  Restoration  of  1868,  more  than  200  of  the  276  han 
had  established  schools.  Some  samurai  and  even  commoners  also 
attended  private  academies,  which  often  specialized  in  particular 
Japanese  subjects  or  in  Western  medicine,  modern  military  science, 
gunnery,  or  Rangaku  (Dutch  studies),  as  European  studies  were 
called  (see  Intellectual  Trends;  The  Emergence  of  Modern  Japan, 
1868-1919,  ch.  1). 

Education  of  commoners  was  generally  practically  oriented, 
providing  basic  training  in  reading,  writing,  and  arithmetic,  em- 
phasizing calligraphy  and  use  of  the  abacus.  Much  of  this  educa- 
tion was  conducted  in  so-called  temple  schools  (terakoya),  derived 
from  earlier  Buddhist  schools.  These  schools  were  no  longer  reli- 
gious institutions,  nor  were  they,  by  1867,  predominantly  located 
in  temples.  By  the  end  of  the  Tokugawa  period,  there  may  have 
been  more  than  14,000  such  schools.  Teaching  techniques  included 
reading  from  various  textbooks,  memorizing,  and  repeatedly  copy- 
ing Chinese  characters  and  Japanese  script. 

After  1868  new  leadership  set  Japan  on  a  rapid  course  of  moder- 
nization. Realizing  from  the  outset  that  education  was  fundamental 
to  nation  building  and  modernization,  the  Meiji  leaders  established 
a  public  education  system  to  help  Japan  catch  up  with  the  West. 
Missions  were  sent  abroad  to  study  the  education  systems  of  lead- 
ing Western  countries.  These  missions  and  other  observers  returned 
with  the  ideas  of  decentralization,  local  school  boards,  and  teacher 
autonomy.  Such  ideas  and  ambitious  initial  plans,  however,  proved 
very  difficult  to  carry  out.  After  some  trial  and  error,  a  new  na- 
tional education  system  emerged.  As  an  indication  of  its  success, 
elementary  school  enrollments  climbed  from  about  40  or  50  per- 
cent of  the  school-age  population  in  the  1870s  to  over  90  percent 
by  1900. 

By  the  1890s,  after  earlier  intensive  preoccupation  with  Western, 
particularly  United  States,  educational  ideas,  a  much  more  con- 
servative and  traditional  orientation  evolved:  the  education  sys- 
tem became  more  reflective  of  Japanese  values.  Confucian  precepts 
were  stressed,  especially  those  concerning  the  hierarchical  nature 
of  human  relations,  service  to  the  new  state,  the  pursuit  of  learn- 
ing, and  morality.  These  ideals,  embodied  in  the  1890  Imperial 
Rescript  on  Education,  along  with  highly  centralized  government 
control  over  education,  largely  guided  Japanese  education  until  the 
end  of  World  War  II.

Education  and  the  Arts 


In  the  early  twentieth  century,  education  at  the  primary  level 
was  egalitarian  and  virtually  universal,  but  at  higher  levels  it  was 
multitracked,  highly  selective,  and  elitist.  College  education  was 
largely  limited  to  the  few  national  universities,  where  German  in- 
fluences were  strong.  Three  of  the  imperial  universities  admitted 
women,  and  there  were  a  number  of  women's  colleges,  some  quite 
prestigious,  but  women  had  relatively  few  opportunities  to  enter 
higher  education.  During  this  period,  a  number  of  universities  were 
founded  by  Christian  missionaries,  who  also  took  an  active  role 
in  expanding  educational  opportunities  for  women,  particularly  at 
the  secondary  level. 

After  1919  several  of  the  private  universities  received  official  sta- 
tus, being  granted  government  recognition  for  programs  they  had 
conducted,  in  many  cases,  since  the  1880s.  In  the  1920s,  the  tra- 
dition of  liberal  education  briefly  reappeared,  particularly  at  the 
kindergarten  level,  where  the  Montessori  method  attracted  a  fol- 
lowing. In  the  1930s,  education  was  subject  to  strong  military  and 
nationalistic  influences. 

By  1945  the  Japanese  education  system  had  been  devastated, 
and  with  the  defeat  came  the  discredit  of  much  prewar  thought. 
A  new  wave  of  foreign  ideas  was  introduced  during  the  postwar 
period  of  military  occupation  (see  World  War  II  and  the  Occupa- 
tion, 1941-52,  ch.  1). 

Occupation  policy  makers  and  the  United  States  Education 
Mission,  set  up  in  1946,  made  a  number  of  changes  aimed  at 
democratizing  Japanese  education:  instituting  the  six-three-three 
grade  structure  (six  years  of  elementary  school,  three  of  lower- 
secondary  school,  and  three  of  upper- secondary  school)  and  ex- 
tending compulsory  schooling  to  nine  years.  They  replaced  the 
prewar  system  of  higher- secondary  schools  with  comprehensive 
upper- secondary  schools  (high  schools).  Curricula  and  textbooks 
were  revised,  the  nationalistic  morals  course  was  abolished  and 
replaced  with  social  studies,  locally  elected  school  boards  were  in- 
troduced, and  teachers  unions  established  (see  Contemporary  Set- 
ting, this  ch.). 

With  the  abolition  of  the  elitist  higher  education  system  and  an 
increase  in  the  number  of  higher  education  institutions,  the  op- 
portunities for  higher  learning  grew.  Expansion  was  accomplished 
initially  by  granting  university  or  junior  college  status  to  a  num- 
ber of  technical  institutes,  normal  schools,  and  advanced  secon- 
dary schools. 

After  the  restoration  of  full  national  sovereignty  in  1952,  Japan 
immediately  began  to  modify  some  of  the  changes  in  education, 


135 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


to  reflect  Japanese  ideas  about  education  and  educational  adminis- 
tration. The  postwar  Ministry  of  Education  regained  a  great  deal 
of  power.  School  boards  were  appointed,  instead  of  elected.  A  course 
in  moral  education  was  reinstituted  in  modified  form,  despite  sub- 
stantial initial  concern  that  it  would  lead  to  a  renewal  of  height- 
ened nationalism. 

By  the  1960s,  postwar  recovery  and  accelerating  economic  growth 
brought  new  demands  to  expand  higher  education  and  greater  stress 
related  to  higher  education  quality  and  finances.  In  general,  the 
1960s  was  a  time  of  great  turbulence  in  higher  education.  Late  in 
the  decade  especially,  universities  in  Japan  were  rocked  by  violent 
student  riots  that  disrupted  many  campuses.  Campus  unrest  was 
the  confluence  of  a  number  of  factors,  including  the  anti- Vietnam 
War  movement  in  Japan,  ideological  differences  between  various 
Japanese  student  groups,  disputes  over  campus  issues  such  as  dis- 
cipline, student  strikes,  and  even  general  dissatisfaction  with  the 
university  system  itself. 

The  government  responded  with  the  University  Control  Law 
in  1969,  and  in  the  early  1970s,  with  further  education  reforms. 
New  laws  governed  the  founding  of  new  universities  and  teachers' 
compensation,  and  public  school  curricula  were  revised.  Private 
education  institutions  began  to  receive  public  aid,  and  a  nation- 
wide standardized  university  entrance  examination  was  added  for 
the  national  universities.  Also  during  this  period,  strong  disagree- 
ment developed  between  the  government  and  teachers  groups. 

Despite  the  numerous  educational  changes  that  have  occurred 
in  Japan  since  1868,  and  especially  since  1945,  the  education  sys- 
tem in  1990  still  reflected  long-standing  cultural  and  philosophical 
ideas:  that  learning  and  education  are  esteemed  and  to  be  pursued 
seriously,  and  that  moral  and  character  development  are  integral 
to  education.  The  meritocratic  legacy  of  the  Meiji  period  has  en- 
dured, as  has  the  centralized  education  structure.  Interest  remains 
in  adapting  foreign  ideas  and  methods  to  Japanese  traditions  and 
in  improving  the  system  generally. 

Education  Reform 

In  spite  of  the  admirable  success  of  the  education  system  since 
World  War  II,  there  were  still  problems  in  the  1980s.  Some  of  these 
difficulties  as  perceived  by  domestic  and  foreign  observers  included 
rigidity,  excessive  uniformity,  lack  of  choices,  undesirable  influences 
of  the  university  examinations,  and  overriding  emphasis  on  for- 
mal educational  credentials.  There  was  also  a  belief  that  educa- 
tion was  responsible  for  some  social  problems  and  for  the  general 
academic,  behavioral,  and  adjustment  problems  of  some  students. 


136 


Education  and  the  Arts 


There  was  great  concern  too  that  Japanese  education  be  respon- 
sive to  the  new  requirements  caused  by  international  challenges 
of  the  changing  world  in  the  twenty-first  century. 

Flexibility,  creativity,  internationalization  (kokusaika),  individu- 
ality, and  diversity  thus  became  the  watchwords  of  Japan's  momen- 
tous education  reform  movement  of  the  1980s,  although  they  echoed 
themes  heard  earlier,  particularly  in  the  1970s  (see  Higher  Educa- 
tion, this  ch.).  The  proposals  and  potential  changes  of  the  1980s 
were  so  significant  that  some  are  comparing  them  to  the  educa- 
tional changes  that  occurred  when  Japan  opened  to  the  West  in 
the  nineteenth  century  and  to  those  of  the  occupation. 

Concerns  of  the  new  reform  movement  were  captured  in  a  se- 
ries of  reports  issued  between  1985  and  1987  by  the  National  Coun- 
cil on  Educational  Reform.  The  final  report  outiined  basic  emphases 
in  response  to  the  internationalization  of  education,  new  informa- 
tion technologies,  and  the  media;  and  emphases  on  individuality, 
lifelong  learning,  and  adjustment  to  social  change.  To  explore  these 
new  directions,  the  council  suggested  that  eight  specific  subjects 
be  considered:  designing  education  for  the  twenty-first  century, 
organizing  a  system  of  lifelong  learning  and  reducing  the  empha- 
sis on  the  educational  background  of  individuals,  improving  and 
diversifying  higher  education,  enriching  and  diversifying  elemen- 
tary and  secondary  education,  improving  the  quality  of  teachers, 
adapting  to  internationalization,  adapting  to  the  information  age, 
and  conducting  a  review  of  the  administration  and  finance  of  edu- 
cation. These  subjects  reflected  both  educational  and  social  aspects 
of  the  reform,  in  keeping  with  the  Japanese  view  about  the  rela- 
tionship of  education  to  society.  Even  as  debate  over  reform  took 
place,  the  government  quickly  moved  to  begin  implementing 
changes  in  most  of  these  eight  areas. 

Contemporary  Setting 

The  late  twentieth-century  Japanese  education  system  had  a 
strong  legal  foundation.  Three  documents  in  particular — the  Fun- 
damental Law  of  Education,  the  School  Education  Law,  and  the 
new  Constitution,  all  adopted  in  1947 — provided  this  legal  basis 
(see  The  Postwar  Constitution,  ch.  6).  The  system  was  highly  cen- 
tralized, although  three  levels  of  government  administration — 
national,  prefectural,  and  municipal — had  various  responsibilities 
for  providing,  financing,  and  supervising  educational  services  for 
the  nation's  more  than  65,000  schools  and  the  nearly  27  million 
students  in  1989  (see  table  5,  Appendix).  At  the  top  of  the  system 
stood  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Science,  and  Culture  (hereafter, 
the  Ministry  of  Education,  or  Monbusho),  which  had  significant 


137 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

responsibility  for  funding,  curricula,  textbooks,  and  national  edu- 
cation standards. 

More  general  responsibilities  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  were 
the  promotion  and  dissemination  of  education,  scientific  knowledge, 
academic  research,  culture,  and  sports.  The  ministry  was  supported 
by  advisory  bodies  and  standing  councils,  such  as  the  Central  Coun- 
cil on  Education,  and  by  ad  hoc  councils,  such  as  the  National 
Council  on  Educational  Reform. 

The  ministry's  authority  and  responsibilities  were  not  limited 
to  public  institutions.  Most  of  its  regulations,  particularly  concern- 
ing compulsory  education,  also  applied  to  private  institutions.  The 
ministry  had  power  to  approve  the  founding  of  universities  and 
supervised  the  national  universities.  In  addition,  it  provided  finan- 
cial assistance  and  guidance  to  lower  levels  of  government  on  educa- 
tional matters  and  was  empowered  to  mandate  changes  in  local 
policies. 

The  ministry  drafted  its  annual  budget  and  education-related 
legislation  and  submitted  them  to  the  Diet  (see  The  Legislature, 
ch.  6).  Monbusho  administered  the  disbursement  of  funds  and 
cooperated  with  other  agencies  concerned  with  education  and  its 
finance.  In  1990  a  main  area  of  ministry  activity  was  implement- 
ing reforms  based  on  the  reports  and  recommendations  of  the  Na- 
tional Council  on  Educational  Reform,  whose  final  report  was 
submitted  to  the  prime  minister  in  1987. 

Each  of  the  forty-seven  prefectures  had  a  five-member  board  of 
education  appointed  by  the  governor  with  the  consent  of  the  prefec- 
tural  assembly.  The  prefectural  boards  administered  and  operated 
public  schools  under  their  supervision,  including  most  of  the  pub- 
lic upper- secondary  schools,  special  schools  for  the  handicapped, 
and  some  other  public  institutions  in  the  prefecture  (see  Local 
Government,  ch.  6).  Prefectural  boards  were  the  teacher-licensing 
bodies;  with  the  advice  of  municipal  governments,  they  appointed 
teachers  to  public  elementary  and  lower- secondary  schools;  they 
also  licensed  preschools  and  other  schools  in  their  municipalities 
and  promoted  social  education. 

Municipal-level  governments  operated  the  public  elementary  and 
lower- secondary  schools  in  their  jurisdictions.  Supervision  was  con- 
ducted by  the  local  board  of  education,  usually  a  five-member  or- 
ganization appointed  by  the  mayor  with  the  consent  of  the  local 
assembly.  The  board  also  made  recommendations  to  the  prefec- 
tures about  the  appointment  or  dismissal  of  teachers  and  adopted 
textbooks  from  the  list  certified  by  the  Ministry  of  Education. 
Mayors  also  were  charged  with  some  responsibilities  for  municipal 
universities  and  budget  coordination.

Education  and  the  Arts 


All  three  levels  of  government — national,  prefectural,  and 
municipal — provided  financial  support  for  education.  National 
government  was  the  largest  source  of  direct  funding,  through  the 
budget  of  the  Ministry  of  Education,  and  a  significant  source  of 
indirect  funding  of  local  education  through  a  tax  rebate  to  local 
government,  in  a  tax  allocation  grant.  The  national  government 
bore  from  one-third  to  one-half  of  the  cost  of  education  in  the  form 
of  teachers'  salaries,  school  construction,  the  school  lunch  program, 
and  vocational  education  and  equipment. 

The  ministry's  budget  between  fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glossary) 
1980  and  FY  1988  increased  a  total  of  about  7  percent  (see  The 
Role  of  Government  and  Business,  ch.  4).  But,  as  a  percentage 
of  the  total  national  budget  (before  the  deduction  of  mandated  ex- 
penses and  debt  service),  the  ministry's  share  actually  declined  stead- 
ily throughout  the  1980s,  from  about  10  percent  in  1980  to  about 
7.7  percent  in  the  budget  proposed  for  FY  1989.  The  proposed  FY 
1989  budget  asked  for  ¥4.637  trillion  (for  value  of  the  yen — see 
Glossary),  an  increase  of  1.34  percent  over  FY  1988's  ¥4.576  trillion. 

Teaching  remained  an  honored  profession,  and  teachers  had  high 
social  status,  stemming  from  the  Japanese  cultural  legacy  and  public 
recognition  of  their  important  social  responsibilities.  Society  ex- 
pected teachers  to  embody  the  ideals  they  were  to  instill,  particu- 
larly because  teaching  duties  extended  to  the  moral  instruction  and 
character  development  of  children.  Formal  classroom  moral  edu- 
cation, informal  instruction,  and  even  academic  classes  were  all 
viewed  as  legitimate  venues  for  this  kind  of  teaching.  Teachers' 
responsibilities  to  their  schools  and  students  frequently  extended 
beyond  the  classroom,  off  school  grounds  and  after  school  hours. 

In  the  1980s,  teachers  were  well  paid,  and  periodic  improvements 
also  were  made  in  teachers'  salaries  and  compensation.  Starting 
salaries  compared  favorably  with  those  of  other  white  collar  profes- 
sionals, and  in  some  cases  were  higher.  In  addition  to  salary,  there 
were  many  types  of  special  allowances  and  a  bonus  (paid  in  three 
installments),  which  in  the  late  1980s  amounted  to  about  five 
months'  salary.  Teachers  also  received  the  standard  health  and 
retirement  benefits  available  to  most  Japanese  salaried  workers. 

Whether  for  economic  reward,  social  status,  or  the  desire  to  teach, 
the  number  of  people  wishing  to  enter  teaching  exceeded  the  num- 
ber of  new  openings  by  as  many  as  five  or  six  applicants  to  every 
one  position.  Prefectural  boards  and  other  public  bodies  were  able 
to  select  the  best  qualified  from  a  large  pool  of  applicants. 

By  the  late  1980s,  the  great  majority  of  new  teachers  were  en- 
tering the  profession  with  a  bachelor's  degree,  but  about  25  per- 
cent of  the  total  teaching  force  at  the  elementary  school  level  did 


139 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

not  have  a  bachelor's  degree.  The  program  for  prospective  teachers 
at  the  undergraduate  level  included  study  in  education  as  well  as 
concentration  in  academic  areas.  Most  new  teachers  majored  in 
a  subject  other  than  education,  and  graduates  of  colleges  of  edu- 
cation were  still  in  the  minority.  After  graduation,  a  teacher  had 
to  pass  a  prefectural-level  examination  to  be  licensed  by  a  prefec- 
tural  board  of  education. 

Changes  also  occurred  during  the  1980s  in  in-service  training 
and  supervision  of  new  teachers.  In-service  training,  particularly 
that  conducted  under  the  auspices  of  the  Ministry  of  Education, 
had  been  questioned  for  many  years.  After  considerable  debate, 
and  some  opposition  from  the  Japan  Teachers  Union  (Nihon 
Kyoshokuin  Kumiai — Nikkyoso),  a  new  system  of  teacher  train- 
ing was  introduced  in  1989.  The  new  system  established  a  one- 
year  training  program,  required  new  teachers  to  work  under  the 
direction  of  a  master  teacher,  and  increased  the  required  number 
of  both  in-school  and  out-of-school  training  days  and  the  length 
of  time  new  teachers  were  under  probationary  status. 

The  Japan  Teachers  Union,  established  in  1947,  was  the  larg- 
est teachers  union  in  the  late  1980s.  The  union  functioned  as  a 
national  federation  of  prefectural  teachers  unions,  although  each 
of  these  unions  had  considerable  autonomy  and  its  own  strengths 
and  political  orientation.  Historically,  there  had  been  considera- 
ble antagonism  between  the  union  and  the  Ministry  of  Education, 
owing  to  a  variety  of  factors.  Some  were  political,  because  the  stance 
of  the  union  had  been  strongly  leftist  and  it  often  opposed  the  more 
conservative  ruling  Liberal  Democratic  Party.  Another  factor  was 
the  trade  union  perspective  that  the  teachers  union  had  on  the 
profession  of  teaching  (see  The  Liberal  Democratic  Party,  ch.  6). 
Additional  differences  on  education  issues  concerned  training  re- 
quirements for  new  teachers,  decentralization  in  education,  school 
autonomy,  curricula,  textbook  censorship,  and,  in  the  late  1980s, 
the  reform  movement. 

The  union  tended  to  support  the  Japan  Socialist  Party,  while 
a  minority  faction  supported  the  Japan  Communist  Party  (see  The 
Opposition  Parties,  ch.  6).  In  the  late  1980s,  internal  disagreements 
in  the  Japan  Teachers  Union  on  political  orientation  and  on  the 
union's  relationships  to  other  national  labor  organizations  finally 
caused  a  rupture.  The  union  thus  became  less  effective  than  in  previ- 
ous years  at  a  time  when  the  national  government  and  the  minis- 
try were  moving  ahead  on  reform  issues.  The  union  had  opposed 
many  reforms  proposed  or  instituted  by  the  ministry,  but  failed 
to  forestall  changes  in  certification  and  teacher  training,  two  is- 
sues on  which  it  was  often  at  odds  with  the  government.  The  new 


140 


Education  and  the  Arts 


union  leadership  that  emerged  after  several  years  of  internal  dis- 
cord seemed  to  take  a  more  conciliatory  approach  to  the  ministry 
and  reform  issues,  but  the  union's  future  directions  were  not  clear. 

Preschool  and  Day  Care 

Early  childhood  education  began  at  home,  and  there  were  numer- 
ous books  and  television  shows  aimed  at  helping  mothers  of 
preschool  children  to  educate  their  children  and  to  ''parent"  more 
effectively.  Much  of  the  home  training  was  devoted  to  teaching 
manners,  proper  social  behavior,  and  structured  play,  although 
verbal  and  number  skills  were  also  popular  themes.  Parents  were 
strongly  committed  to  early  education  and  frequently  enrolled  their 
children  in  preschools. 

Preschool  education  provided  the  transition  from  home  to  for- 
mal school  for  most  children.  Children's  lives  at  home  were  charac- 
terized by  indulgence,  and  the  largely  nonacademic  preschool 
experience  helped  children  make  the  adjustment  to  the  group- 
oriented  life  of  school  and,  in  turn,  to  life  in  society  itself  (see  Values, 
ch.  2). 

Preschools  (ydchien),  predominantly  staffed  by  young  female  junior 
college  graduates,  were  supervised  by  the  Ministry  of  Education 
in  the  1980s,  but  were  not  part  of  the  official  education  system. 
In  addition  to  preschools,  a  well-developed  system  of  government- 
supervised  day-care  centers  (hoikuen),  supervised  by  the  Ministry 
of  Labor,  was  an  important  provider  of  preschool  education. 
Together,  these  two  kinds  of  institutions  enrolled  well  over  90  per- 
cent of  all  preschool-age  children  prior  to  their  entrance  into  the 
formal  system  at  first  grade.  The  Ministry  of  Education's  1990 
Course  of  Study  for  Preschools,  which  applied  to  both  kinds  of  in- 
stitutions, covered  such  areas  as  human  relationships,  environment, 
words  (language),  and  expression.  The  58  percent  of  preschools 
that  were  private  accounted  for  77  percent  of  all  children  enrolled. 

Primary  and  Secondary  Education 

Education  in  postwar  Japan  was  compulsory  and  free  for  all 
school  children  from  the  first  through  the  ninth  grades  (see  fig.  5). 
The  school  year  began  on  April  1  and  ended  on  March  3 1  of  the 
following  year.  Schools  used  a  trimester  system  demarcated  by  va- 
cation breaks.  Japanese  children  attended  school  five  full  weekdays 
and  one-half  day  on  Saturdays.  The  school  year  had  a  legal  mini- 
mum of  210  days,  but  most  local  school  boards  added  about  30 
more  days  for  school  festivals,  athletic  meets,  and  ceremonies  with 
nonacademic  educational  objectives,  especially  those  encouraging 
cooperation  and  school  spirit.  With  allowance  made  for  the  time

devoted  to  such  activities  and  the  half  day  of  school  on  Saturday, 
the  number  of  days  devoted  to  instruction  was  about  195  per  year. 

The  Japanese  hold  several  important  beliefs  about  education, 
especially  compulsory  schooling:  that  all  children  have  the  ability 
to  learn  the  material;  that  effort,  perseverance,  and  self-discipline, 
not  academic  ability,  determine  academic  success;  and  that  these 
study  and  behavioral  habits  can  be  taught.  Thus,  students  in 


142 


Education  and  the  Arts 


elementary  and  lower-secondary  schools  were  not  grouped  or  taught 
on  the  basis  of  their  ability,  nor  was  instruction  geared  to  individual 
differences. 

The  nationally  designed  curricula  exposed  students  to  balanced, 
basic  education,  and  compulsory  schooling  was  known  for  its  equal 
educational  treatment  of  students  and  for  its  relatively  equal  dis- 
tribution of  financial  resources  among  schools.  However,  the  de- 
mands made  by  the  uniform  curricula  and  approach  extracted  a 
price  in  lack  of  flexibility,  including  expected  conformity  of  be- 
havior. Little  effort  was  made  to  address  children  with  special  needs 
and  interests.  Much  of  the  reform  proposed  in  the  late  1980s,  par- 
ticularly that  part  emphasizing  greater  flexibility,  creativity,  and 
opportunities  for  greater  individual  expression,  was  aimed  at  chang- 
ing these  approaches. 

Textbooks  were  free  to  students  at  compulsory  school  levels.  New 
texts  were  selected  by  school  boards  or  principals  once  every  three 
years  from  the  Ministry  of  Education's  list  of  approved  textbooks 
or  from  a  small  list  of  texts  that  the  ministry  itself  published.  The 
ministry  bore  the  cost  of  distributing  these  books,  in  both  public 
and  private  schools.  Textbooks  were  small,  paperbound  volumes 
that  could  easily  be  carried  by  the  students  and  that  became  their 
property. 

Almost  all  schools  had  a  system  of  access  to  health  profession- 
als. Educational  and  athletic  facilities  were  good;  almost  all  elemen- 
tary schools  had  an  outdoor  playground,  roughly  90  percent  had 
a  gymnasium,  and  75  percent  an  outdoor  swimming  pool. 

Elementary  School 

In  the  late  1980s,  more  than  99  percent  of  elementary  school- 
age  children  were  enrolled  in  school.  All  children  entered  first  grade 
at  age  six,  and  starting  school  was  considered  a  very  important 
event  in  a  child's  life. 

Virtually  all  elementary  education  took  place  in  public  schools; 
less  than  1  percent  of  the  schools  were  private.  Private  schools  tended 
to  be  costly,  although  the  rate  of  cost  increases  in  tuition  for  these 
schools  had  slowed  in  the  1980s.  Some  private  elementary  schools 
were  prestigious  and  served  as  a  first  step  to  higher-level  private 
schools  with  which  they  were  affiliated,  and  thence  to  a  univer- 
sity. Competition  to  enter  some  of  these  "ladder  schools"  was  quite 
intense. 

Although  public  elementary  education  was  free,  some  school  ex- 
penses were  borne  by  parents,  for  example,  school  lunches  and  sup- 
plies. For  many  families,  there  were  also  nonschool  educational 
expenses,  for  extra  books,  or  private  lessons,  or  juku  (see  Glossary). 


143 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Such  expenses  rose  throughout  the  decade,  reaching  an  average 
of  ¥184,000  (US$1,314)  in  FY  1987  for  each  child.  Costs  for  pri- 
vate elementary  schools  were  substantially  higher. 

Elementary  school  classes  were  large,  about  thirty-one  students 
per  class  on  average,  but  higher  numbers  were  permitted.  Students 
were  usually  organized  into  small  work  groups,  which  had  both 
academic  and  disciplinary  functions.  Discipline  also  was  main- 
tained, and  a  sense  of  responsibility  encouraged,  by  the  use  of  stu- 
dent monitors  and  by  having  the  students  assume  responsibility 
for  the  physical  appearance  of  their  classroom  and  school. 

The  ministry's  Course  of  Study  for  Elementary  Schools  was  com- 
posed of  a  wide  variety  of  subjects,  both  academic  and  nonaca- 
demic,  including  moral  education  and  "special  activities."  "Special 
activities"  referred  to  scheduled  weekly  time  given  over  to  class 
affairs  and  to  preparing  for  the  school  activities  and  ceremonies 
that  were  used  to  emphasize  character  development  and  the  im- 
portance of  group  effort  and  cooperation.  The  standard  academic 
curriculum  included  Japanese  language,  social  studies,  arithme- 
tic, and  science.  Nonacademic  subjects  taught  included  art  and 
handicrafts,  music,  homemaking,  physical  education,  and  moral 
education.  Japanese  language  was  the  subject  most  emphasized. 
The  complexity  of  the  written  language  and  the  diversity  of  its 
spoken  forms  in  educated  speech  require  this  early  attention. 

A  new  course  of  study  was  established  in  1989,  partly  as  a  result 
of  the  education  reform  movement  of  the  1980s  and  partly  because 
of  ongoing  curriculum  review.  Important  changes  scheduled  were 
an  increased  number  of  hours  devoted  to  Japanese  language,  the 
replacement  of  the  social  sciences  course  with  a  daily  life  course — 
instruction  for  children  on  proper  interaction  with  the  society  and 
environment  around  them — and  an  increased  emphasis  on  moral 
education.  While  evidence  was  still  inconclusive,  it  appeared  that 
at  least  some  children  were  having  difficulties  with  Japanese  lan- 
guage. New  emphasis  also  was  to  be  given  in  the  curriculum  to 
the  national  flag  and  the  national  anthem.  The  ministry  suggested 
that  the  flag  be  flown  and  the  national  anthem  be  sung  at  impor- 
tant school  ceremonies.  Because  neither  the  flag  nor  the  anthem 
had  been  legally  designated  as  national  symbols,  and  because  of 
the  nationalistic  wartime  associations  the  two  had  in  the  minds  of 
some  citizens,  the  suggestion  from  the  ministry  was  greeted  with 
some  opposition.  The  revised  history  curriculum  was  to  empha- 
size cultural  legacies  and  events  and  the  biographies  of  key  figures. 
The  ministry  provided  a  proposed  list  of  biographies,  and  there 
was  some  criticism  surrounding  particular  suggestions. 


144 


Education  and  the  Arts 


Elementary  teachers  were  generally  responsible  for  all  subjects, 
and  classes  remained  in  one  room  for  most  activities.  Teachers  were 
well  prepared  in  the  subjects  they  taught.  Most  teachers,  about  60 
percent  of  the  total,  were  women;  but  most  principals  and  head 
teachers  in  elementary  schools  were  men. 

Teachers  had  ample  teaching  materials  and  audiovisual  equip- 
ment. There  was  an  excellent  system  of  educational  television  and 
radio,  and  almost  all  elementary  schools  used  programs  prepared 
by  the  School  Education  Division  of  Japan  Broadcasting  Corpo- 
ration (Nippon  Hoso  Kyokai — NHK).  In  addition  to  broadcast 
media,  schools  increasingly  were  equipped  with  computers. 
Although  only  6.5  percent  of  public  elementary  schools  had  per- 
sonal computers  in  1986,  by  1989  the  number  had  passed  20  per- 
cent. The  ministry  was  greatly  concerned  with  this  issue  and 
planned  much  greater  use  of  such  equipment. 

Virtually  all  elementary  schoolchildren  received  a  full  lunch  at 
school.  Although  heavily  subsidized  by  government,  both  directly 
and  indirectiy,  the  program  was  not  altogether  free.  Full  meals 
usually  consisted  of  bread  (or  increasingly,  of  rice),  a  main  dish, 
and  milk.  Though  the  program  grew  out  of  concern  in  the  immedi- 
ate postwar  period  for  adequate  nutrition,  the  school  lunch  was 
also  important  as  a  teaching  device.  Because  there  were  relatively 
few  cafeterias  in  elementary  schools,  meals  were  taken  in  the  class- 
room with  the  teacher,  providing  another  informal  opportunity  for 
teaching  nutrition  and  health  and  good  eating  habits  and  social 
behavior.  Frequently,  students  also  were  responsible  for  serving 
the  lunch  and  cleanup. 

Japanese  elementary  schooling  was  acknowledged  both  in  Japan 
and  abroad  to  be  excellent,  but  not  without  some  problems,  nota- 
bly increasing  absenteeism  and  a  declining  but  troublesome  num- 
ber of  cases  of  bullying.  In  addition,  special  provision  for  the  many 
young  children  returning  to  Japan  from  long  absences  overseas  was 
an  issue  of  major  interest.  The  government  also  was  concerned  with 
the  education  of  Japanese  children  residing  abroad  and  sent  teachers 
overseas  to  teach  in  Japanese  schools. 

Elementary  school  education  was  seen  in  Japan  as  fundamental 
in  shaping  a  positive  attitude  toward  lifelong  education.  Regard- 
less of  academic  achievement,  almost  all  children  in  elementary 
school  were  advanced  to  lower- secondary  schools,  the  second  of 
the  two  compulsory  levels  of  education. 

Lower-Secondary  School 

Lower- secondary  school  covered  grades  seven,  eight,  and  nine — 
children  between  the  ages  of  roughly  twelve  and  fifteen — with 


145

increased  focus  on  academic  studies.  Although  it  was  still  possible 
to  leave  the  formal  education  system  after  completing  lower- 
secondary  school  and  find  work,  fewer  than  4  percent  did  so  by 
the  late  1980s. 

Like  elementary  schools,  most  lower- secondary  schools  in  the 
1980s  were  public,  but  5  percent  were  private.  Private  schools  were 
costly,  averaging  ¥558,592  (US$3,989)  per  student  in  1988,  about 
four  times  more  than  the  ¥130,828  (US$934)  that  the  ministry 
estimated  as  the  parental  cost  for  students  enrolled  in  public  lower- 
secondary  schools. 

The  teaching  force  in  lower- secondary  schools  was  two-thirds 
male.  Schools  were  headed  by  principals,  99  percent  of  whom  were 
men  in  1988.  Teachers  had  often  majored  in  the  subjects  they 
taught,  and  more  than  80  percent  had  graduated  from  a  four-year 
college.  Classes  were  large,  with  thirty-eight  pupils  per  class  on 
average,  and  each  class  was  assigned  a  homeroom  teacher  who  dou- 
bled as  counselor.  Unlike  elementary  students,  lower-secondary 
school  students  had  different  teachers  for  different  subjects.  The 
teacher,  however,  rather  than  the  students,  moved  to  a  new  room 
for  each  fifty-minute  period. 

Instruction  in  lower- secondary  schools  tended  to  rely  on  the  lec- 
ture method.  Teachers  also  used  other  media,  such  as  television 
and  radio,  and  there  was  some  lab  work.  About  45  percent  of  all 
public  lower- secondary  schools  had  computers,  including  schools 
that  used  them  only  for  administrative  purposes.  Classroom  or- 
ganization was  still  based  on  small  work  groups,  although  no  longer 
for  reasons  of  discipline.  By  lower- secondary  school,  students  were 
expected  to  have  mastered  daily  routines  and  acceptable  behavior. 

All  course  contents  were  specified  in  the  Course  of  Study  for 
Lower- Secondary  Schools.  Some  subjects,  such  as  Japanese  lan- 
guage and  mathematics,  were  coordinated  with  the  elementary  cur- 
riculum. Others,  such  as  foreign-language  study,  usually  English, 
began  at  this  level.  The  curriculum  covered  Japanese  language, 
social  studies,  mathematics,  science,  music,  fine  arts,  health,  and 
physical  education.  All  students  also  were  exposed  to  either  indus- 
trial arts  or  homemaking.  Moral  education  and  special  activities 
continued  to  receive  attention. 

Students  also  attended  mandatory  club  meetings  during  school 
hours,  and  many  also  participated  in  after-school  clubs.  Most  lower- 
secondary  students  said  they  liked  school,  although  it  was  the  chance 
to  meet  their  friends  daily — not  the  lessons — that  was  particularly 
attractive  to  them. 

The  ministry  recognized  a  need  to  improve  the  teaching  of  all 
foreign  languages,  especially  English.  To  improve  instruction  in 


146 


Education  and  the  Arts 


spoken  English,  the  government  invited  many  young  native  speak- 
ers of  English  to  Japan  to  serve  as  assistants  to  school  boards  and 
prefectures  under  its  Japan  Exchange  and  Teaching  Program.  By 
1988,  participants  numbered  over  1,000. 

As  part  of  the  movement  to  develop  an  integrated  curriculum 
and  the  education  reform  movement  of  the  late  1980s,  the  entire 
Course  of  Study  for  Lower- Secondary  Schools  was  revised  in  1989 
to  take  effect  in  the  1991-93  school  years.  A  main  aim  of  the  re- 
form was  to  equip  students  with  the  basic  knowledge  needed  for 
citizenship.  In  some  measure,  this  meant  increased  emphasis  on 
Japanese  history  and  culture,  as  well  as  understanding  Japan  as 
a  nation  and  its  relationships  with  other  nations  of  the  world.  The 
course  of  study  also  increased  elective  hours,  recommending  that 
electives  be  chosen  in  light  of  individual  student  differences  and 
with  an  eye  toward  diversification. 

Two  problems  of  great  concern  to  educators  and  citizens  began 
to  appear  at  the  lower- secondary  level  in  the  1980s:  bullying,  which 
seemed  rampant  in  the  mid-1980s  but  had  abated  somewhat  by 
the  end  of  the  decade,  and  the  school-refusal  syndrome  (toko  kyohi — 
manifested  by  a  student's  excessive  absenteeism),  which  was  on 
the  rise.  Experts  disagreed  over  the  specific  causes  of  these  phenome- 
na, but  there  was  general  agreement  that  the  system  offered  little 
individualized  or  specialized  assistance,  thus  contributing  to  dis- 
affection among  those  who  could  not  conform  to  its  demands  or 
who  were  otherwise  experiencing  difficulties.  Another  problem  con- 
cerned Japanese  children  returning  from  abroad.  These  students, 
particularly  if  they  had  been  overseas  for  extended  periods,  often 
needed  help  not  only  in  reading  and  writing,  but  in  adjusting  to 
rigid  classroom  demands.  Even  making  the  adjustment  did  not 
guarantee  acceptance:  besides  having  acquired  a  foreign  language, 
many  of  these  students  had  also  acquired  foreign  customs  of  speech, 
dress,  and  behavior  that  marked  them  as  different. 

Special  Education 

Japanese  special  education  at  the  compulsory  level  was  highly 
organized  in  the  late  1980s,  even  though  it  had  been  nationally 
mandated  and  implemented  only  in  1979.  In  1990  there  was  still 
controversy  over  whether  children  with  special  needs  could  or  should 
be  "mainstreamed."  In  a  society  that  stressed  the  group,  many 
parents  desired  to  have  their  children  attend  regular  schools.  Main- 
streaming  in  Japan,  however,  did  not  necessarily  mean  attend- 
ing regular  classes;  it  often  meant  attending  a  regular  school  that 
had  special  classes  for  handicapped  students.  There  were  also  spe- 
cial public  schools  for  the  handicapped,  which  had  departments 


147 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

equivalent  to  the  various  levels  of  elementary  and  secondary  schools, 
including  kindergarten  and  upper- secondary  departments  in  some 
cases.  There  were  few  private  institutions  for  special  education. 
Some  students  attended  regular  classes  and  also  special  classes  for 
training  for  their  particular  needs.  Some  teachers  were  also  dis- 
patched to  children  who  could  not  attend  schools  (see  table  6,  Ap- 
pendix) . 

Upper-Secondary  School 

Even  though  upper- secondary  school  was  not  compulsory  in 
Japan,  94  percent  of  all  lower- secondary  school  graduates  entered 
upper- secondary  schools  in  1989.  Private  upper- secondary  schools 
accounted  for  about  24  percent  of  all  upper-secondary  schools,  and 
neither  public  nor  private  schools  were  free.  The  Ministry  of  Edu- 
cation estimated  that  annual  family  expenses  for  the  education  of 
a  child  in  a  public  upper- secondary  school  were  about  ¥300,000 
(US$2,142)  in  both  1986  and  1987  and  that  private  upper- secondary 
schools  were  about  twice  as  expensive. 

All  upper- secondary  schools,  public  and  private,  were  informally 
ranked,  based  on  their  success  in  placing  graduates  in  freshman 
classes  of  the  most  prestigious  universities.  In  the  1980s,  private 
upper- secondary  schools  occupied  the  highest  levels  of  this  hier- 
archy, and  there  was  substantial  pressure  to  do  well  in  the  exami- 
nations that  determined  the  upper- secondary  school  a  child  entered. 
Admission  also  depended  on  the  scholastic  record  and  performance 
evaluation  from  lower-secondary  school,  but  the  examination  results 
largely  determined  school  entrance.  Students  were  closely  coun- 
seled in  lower- secondary  school,  so  that  they  would  be  relatively 
assured  of  a  place  in  the  schools  to  which  they  applied. 

The  most  common  type  of  upper- secondary  schools  had  a  full- 
time,  general  program  that  offered  academic  courses  for  students 
preparing  for  higher  education  and  also  technical  and  vocational 
courses  for  students  expecting  to  find  employment  after  gradua- 
tion. More  than  70  percent  of  upper- secondary  school  students  en- 
rolled in  the  general  academic  program  in  the  late  1980s.  A  small 
number  of  schools  offered  part-time  or  evening  courses  or  correspon- 
dence education. 

The  first-year  programs  for  students  in  both  academic  and  com- 
mercial courses  were  similar.  They  included  basic  academic  courses, 
such  as  Japanese  language,  English,  mathematics,  and  science.  In 
upper-secondary  school,  differences  in  ability  were  first  publicly 
acknowledged,  and  course  content  and  course  selection  were  far 
more  individualized  in  the  second  year.  However,  there  was  a  core 
of  academic  material  throughout  all  programs. 


148 


Education  and  the  Arts 


Vocational- technical  programs  included  several  hundred  special- 
ized courses,  such  as  information  processing,  navigation,  fish  farm- 
ing, business  English,  and  ceramics.  Business  and  industrial  courses 
were  the  most  popular,  accounting  for  72  percent  of  all  students 
in  full-time  vocational  programs  in  1989. 

The  upper- secondary  curriculum  also  underwent  thorough  re- 
vision; and  in  1989  a  new  Course  of  Study  for  Upper- Secondary 
Schools  was  announced  that  would  be  phased  in  beginning  in  1994. 
Among  noteworthy  changes  was  the  requirement  that  both  male 
and  female  students  take  a  course  in  home  economics.  The  govern- 
ment was  concerned  with  instilling  in  all  students  an  awareness 
of  the  importance  of  family  life,  the  various  roles  and  responsibili- 
ties of  family  members,  the  concept  of  cooperation  within  the  fam- 
ily, and  the  role  of  the  family  in  society.  The  family  continued  to 
be  an  extremely  important  part  of  the  social  infrastructure,  and 
the  ministry  clearly  was  interested  in  maintaining  family  stability 
within  a  changing  society.  Another  change  of  note  was  the  divi- 
sion of  the  old  social  studies  course  into  history,  geography,  and 
civics  courses. 

Most  upper- secondary  teachers  in  the  late  1980s  were  univer- 
sity graduates.  Upper-secondary  schools  were  organized  into  depart- 
ments, and  teachers  specialized  in  their  major  fields  although  they 
taught  a  variety  of  courses  within  their  disciplines.  Although  women 
composed  about  20  percent  of  the  teaching  force,  only  2.5  percent 
of  principals  were  women. 

Teaching  depended  largely  on  the  lecture  system,  with  the  main 
goal  of  covering  the  very  demanding  curriculum  in  the  time  allot- 
ted. Approach  and  subject  coverage  tended  to  be  uniform,  at  least 
in  the  public  schools.  As  in  lower- secondary  school,  the  teachers, 
not  the  students,  moved  from  room  to  room  after  each  fifty-minute 
class  period. 

Upper- secondary  students  were  subject  to  a  great  deal  of  super- 
vision by  school  authorities  and  school  rules  even  outside  of  school. 
Students'  behavior  and  some  activities  were  regulated  by  school 
codes  that  were  known  and  obeyed  by  most  children.  School  regu- 
lations often  set  curfews  and  governed  dress  codes,  hairstyles,  stu- 
dent employment,  and  even  leisure  activities.  The  school  frequently 
was  responsible  for  student  discipline  when  a  student  ran  afoul  of 
the  regulations,  or  occasionally,  of  the  law.  Delinquency,  generally, 
and  school  violence,  in  particular,  were  troubling  to  Japanese 
authorities.  Violations  by  upper- secondary  school  students  included 
smoking  and  some  substance  abuse  (predominantly  of  ampheta- 
mines). Use  of  drugs,  although  not  a  serious  problem  by  interna- 
tional standards,  was  of  concern  to  the  police  and  civil  authorities 


149 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

(see  Public  Order  and  Internal  Security,  ch.  8).  Bullying  and  the 
drop-out  rate  were  also  subjects  of  attention.  Upper- secondary  stu- 
dents dropped  out  at  a  rate  of  between  2.0  and  2.5  percent  per 
year.  The  graduation  rates  for  upper- secondary  schools  stood  at 
87.5  percent  in  1987. 

Discrimination  in  education  was  prohibited,  but  the  burakumin 
(outcast  people),  a  group  of  people  racially  and  culturally  Japanese 
who  had  been  discriminated  against  historically,  were  still  dis- 
advantaged in  education  to  some  degree  (see  Minorities,  ch.  2). 
Their  relatively  poor  educational  attainment  through  the  upper- 
secondary  level  in  the  1960s  was  said  to  have  been  largely  corrected 
by  the  1980s,  but  reliable  evidence  was  lacking. 

There  were  some  private  schools  for  the  children  of  the  foreign 
community  in  Japan,  and  some  Korean  schools  for  children  of 
Japan's  Korean  minority  population,  many  of  whom  were  second- 
generation  or  third- generation  residents  in  Japan.  Graduates  of 
Korean  schools  faced  some  discrimination,  particularly  in  enter- 
ing higher  education.  Observers  estimated  that  75  percent  of  Korean 
children  were  attending  Japanese  schools  in  the  early  1980s. 

Training  of  handicapped  students,  particularly  at  the  upper- 
secondary  level,  emphasized  vocational  education,  to  enable  stu- 
dents to  be  as  independent  as  possible  within  society.  Vocational 
training  varied  considerably  depending  on  the  student's  handicap, 
but  the  options  were  limited  for  some.  It  was  clear  that  the  govern- 
ment was  aware  of  the  necessity  of  broadening  the  range  of  possi- 
bilities for  these  students.  Advancement  to  higher  education  was 
also  a  goal  of  the  government,  and  it  struggled  to  have  institutions 
of  higher  learning  accept  more  handicapped  students. 

Upper- secondary  school  students  returning  to  Japan  after  liv- 
ing overseas  presented  another  problem.  The  ministry  was  trying 
to  get  upper-secondary  schools  to  accept  these  students  more  readily, 
and  in  the  late  1980s  had  decided  to  allow  credit  for  one  upper- 
secondary  school  year  spent  abroad. 

Upper- secondary  school  graduates  choosing  to  enter  the  world 
of  work  were  supported  by  a  very  effective  system  of  job  place- 
ment, which,  combined  with  favorable  economic  conditions,  kept 
the  unemployment  rate  among  new  graduates  quite  low  (see  The 
Structure  of  Japan's  Labor  Market,  ch.  4).  For  those  students  going 
on  to  college,  the  final  phases  of  school  life  became  increasingly 
dedicated  to  preparing  for  examinations,  particularly  in  some  of 
the  elite  private  schools.  About  31  percent  of  upper- secondary 
graduates  advanced  to  some  form  of  higher  education  direcdy  after 
graduation. 


150 


Education  and  the  Arts 


After- school  clubs  provided  an  important  upper- secondary  school 
activity.  Sports,  recreational  reading,  and  watching  television  were 
popular  daily  leisure  activities,  but  schoolwork  and  other  studies 
remained  the  focus  of  the  daily  lives  of  most  children.  The  college 
entrance  examinations  greatly  influenced  school  life  and  study 
habits,  not  only  for  college-bound  students,  but  indirectly  for  all; 
the  prospect  of  the  examinations  often  imparted  a  seriousness  to 
the  tone  of  school  life  at  the  upper- secondary  level. 

After-School  Education 

Much  debated,  and  often  criticized  in  the  late  twentieth  century, 
juku  were  special  private  schools  that  offered  highly  organized  les- 
sons conducted  after  regular  school  hours  and  on  the  weekends. 
Although  best  known  and  most  widely  publicized  for  their  role  as 
"cram  schools,"  where  children  (sent  by  concerned  parents)  could 
study  to  improve  scores  on  upper- secondary  school  entrance  ex- 
aminations, academicjtt£w  actually  performed  several  educational 
functions.  They  provided  supplementary  education  that  many  chil- 
dren needed  just  to  keep  up  with  the  regular  school  curriculum, 
remedial  education  for  the  increasing  numbers  of  children  who 
fell  behind  in  their  work,  and  preparation  for  students  striving  to 
improve  test  scores  and  preparing  for  the  all-important  upper- 
secondary  and  university  entrance  examinations.  In  many  ways, 
juku  compensated  for  the  formal  education  system's  inability  or  un- 
willingness to  address  particular  individual  problems.  Half  of  all 
compulsory  school-age  children  attended  academic  juku,  which 
offered  instruction  in  mathematics,  Japanese  language,  science, 
English,  and  social  studies.  Many  other  children,  particularly 
younger  children,  attended  nonacademic7'w£tt  for  piano  lessons,  art 
instruction,  swimming,  and  abacus  lessons.  To  some  observers, 
juku  represented  an  attempt  by  parents  to  exercise  a  meaningful 
measure  of  choice  in  Japanese  education,  particularly  for  children 
attending  public  schools.  Some  juku  offered  subject  matter  not  avail- 
able in  the  public  school  curricula,  while  others  emphasized  a  spe- 
cial philosophical  or  ethical  approach. 

Juku  also  played  a  social  role,  and  children  in  Japan  said  they 
liked  going  to  juku  because  they  were  able  to  make  new  friends; 
many  children  asked  to  be  sent  because  their  friends  attended.  Some 
children  seemed  to  like  juku  because  of  the  closer  personal  contact 
they  had  with  their  teachers. 

Juku  attendance  rose  from  the  1970s  through  the  mid-1980s;  par- 
ticipation rates  increased  at  every  grade  level  throughout  the  com- 
pulsory education  years.  This  phenomenon  was  a  source  of  great 
concern  to  the  ministry,  which  issued  directives  to  the  regular 


151 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

schools  that  it  hoped  would  reduce  the  need  for  after- school  les- 
sons, but  these  directives  had  little  practical  effect. 

Somejw^w  even  had  branches  in  the  United  States  and  other  coun- 
tries to  help  children  living  abroad  to  catch  up  with  students  in 
Japan.  Because  of  the  commercial  nature  of  most  juku,  some  crit- 
ics argued  that  they  had  profit  rather  than  education  at  heart,  and 
not  all  students  could  afford  to  attend.  Juku  introduced  some  in- 
equality into  what  had  been  a  relatively  egalitarian  approach  to 
education,  at  least  in  public  schools  through  ninth  grade.  Yet,  while 
some  juku  were  expensive,  the  majority  were  affordable  for  most 
families \juku  could  not  price  themselves  beyond  the  reach  of  their 
potential  clientele.  If  rising  enrollments  in  juku  were  any  indica- 
tion, costs  were  not  yet  a  limiting  factor  for  most  parents,  andjw/rw 
clearly  were  given  some  priority  in  family  budgeting. 

If  a  student  did  not  attend  juku,  it  did  not  mean  that  he  or  she 
was  necessarily  at  a  disadvantage  in  school.  Other  avenues  of  as- 
sistance were  available.  For  example,  self-help  literature  and  sup- 
plemental texts  and  study  guides,  some  produced  by  publishing 
houses  associated  with  juku,  were  widely  available  commercially. 
Most  of  these  items  were  moderately  priced.  A  correspondence 
course  of  the  Upper- Secondary  School  of  the  Air  was  broadcast 
almost  daily  on  the  NHK  educational  radio  and  television  chan- 
nels. These  programs  were  free,  and  costs  for  accompanying  text- 
books were  nominal.  In  addition,  about  1  percent  of  elementary 
school  students  and  7.3  percent  of  lower- secondary  school  students 
took  extra  lessons  at  home  with  tutors. 

Higher  Education 

College  Entrance 

College  entrance  was  based  largely  on  the  scores  that  students 
achieved  in  entrance  examinations.  Private  institutions  accounted 
for  73  percent  of  all  university  enrollments  in  1988,  but  with  a  few 
exceptions,  the  public  national  universities  were  the  most  highly 
regarded.  This  distinction  had  its  origins  in  historical  factors — the 
long  years  of  dominance  of  the  select  imperial  universities,  such 
as  Tokyo  and  Kyoto  universities,  which  trained  Japan's  leaders 
before  the  war — and  also  in  differences  in  quality,  particularly  in 
facilities  and  faculty  ratios.  In  addition,  certain  prestigious  employ- 
ers, notably  the  government  and  select  large  corporations,  continued 
to  restrict  their  hiring  of  new  employees  to  graduates  of  the  most 
esteemed  universities.  There  was  a  close  link  between  university 
background  and  employment  opportunity.  Because  Japanese  so- 
ciety placed  such  store  in  academic  credentials,  the  competition

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

to  enter  the  prestigious  universities  was  keen.  In  addition,  the 
eighteen-year-old  population  was  still  growing  in  the  late  1980s, 
increasing  the  number  of  applicants. 

Students  applying  to  national  universities  took  two  entrance  ex- 
aminations, first  a  nationally  administered  uniform  achievement 
test  and  then  an  examination  administered  by  the  university  that 
the  student  hoped  to  enter.  Applicants  to  private  universities  needed 
to  take  only  the  university's  examination.  Some  national  schools 
had  so  many  applicants  that  they  used  the  first  test,  the  Joint  First 
Stage  Achievement  Test,  as  a  screening  device  for  qualification  to 
their  own  admissions  test. 

Such  intense  competition  meant  that  many  students  could  not 
compete  successfully  for  admission  to  the  college  of  their  choice. 
An  unsuccessful  student  could  either  accept  an  admission  elsewhere, 
forego  a  college  education,  or  wait  until  the  following  spring  to  take 
the  national  examinations  again.  A  large  number  of  students  chose 
the  last  option.  These  students,  called  ronin  (see  Glossary),  spent 
an  entire  year,  and  sometimes  longer,  studying  for  another  attempt 
at  the  entrance  examinations. 

Yobiko  (see  Glossary)  are  private  schools  that  in  current  times, 
like  many  juku,  help  students  prepare  for  entrance  examinations. 
Whileyobiko  have  many  programs  for  upper-secondary  school  stu- 
dents, they  are  best  known  for  their  specially  designed  full-time, 
year-long  classes  for  ronin.  The  number  of  applicants  to  four-year 
universities  totalled  almost  560,000  in  1988.  Ronin  accounted  for 
about  40  percent  of  new  entrants  to  four-year  colleges  in  1988.  Most 
ronin  were  men,  but  about  14  percent  were  women.  The  ronin  ex- 
perience was  so  common  in  Japan  that  the  Japanese  educational 
structure  was  often  said  to  have  an  extra  ronin  year  built  into  it. 

Yobiko  sponsored  a  variety  of  programs,  both  full-time  and  part- 
time,  and  employed  an  extremely  sophisticated  battery  of  tests,  stu- 
dent counseling  sessions,  and  examination  analysis  to  supplement 
their  classroom  instruction.  The  cost  oi yobiko  education  was  high, 
comparable  to  first-year  university  expenses,  and  some  specialized 
courses  at  yobiko  were  even  more  expensive.  Someyobiko  published 
modified  commercial  versions  of  the  proprietary  texts  they  used 
in  their  classrooms  through  publishing  affiliates  or  by  other  means, 
and  these  were  popular  among  the  general  population  preparing 
for  college  entrance  exams.  Yobiko  also  administered  practice  ex- 
aminations throughout  the  year,  which  they  opened  to  all  students 
for  a  fee. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  examination  and  entrance  process  were 
the  subjects  of  renewed  debate.  In  1987  the  schedule  of  the  Joint 
First  Stage  Achievement  Test  was  changed,  and  the  content  of  the 


154 


Education  and  the  Arts 


examination  itself  was  revised  for  1990.  The  schedule  changes  for 
the  first  time  provided  some  flexibility  for  students  wishing  to  ap- 
ply to  more  than  one  national  university.  The  new  Joint  First  Stage 
Achievement  Test  was  prepared  and  administered  by  the  National 
Center  for  University  Entrance  Examination  and  was  designed  to 
accomplish  better  assessment  of  academic  achievement. 

The  ministry  hoped  many  private  schools  would  adopt  or  adapt 
the  new  national  test  to  their  own  admissions  requirements  and 
thereby  reduce  or  eliminate  the  university  tests.  But,  by  the  time 
the  new  test  was  administered  in  1990,  few  schools  had  displayed 
any  inclination  to  do  so.  The  ministry  urged  universities  to  increase 
the  number  of  students  admitted  through  alternate  selection 
methods,  including  admission  of  students  returning  to  Japan  from 
long  overseas  stays,  admission  by  recommendation,  and  admis- 
sion of  students  who  had  graduated  from  upper- secondary  schools 
more  than  a  few  years  before.  Although  a  number  of  schools  had 
programs  in  place  or  reserved  spaces  for  returning  students,  only 
5  percent  of  university  students  were  admitted  under  these  alter- 
nate arrangements  in  the  late  1980s. 

Other  college  entrance  issues  were  proper  guidance  for  college 
placement  at  the  upper- secondary  level  and  better  dissemination 
of  information  about  university  programs.  The  ministry  provided 
information  through  the  National  Center  for  University  Entrance 
Examination's  on-line  information  access  system  and  encouraged 
universities,  faculties,  and  departments  to  prepare  brochures  and 
video  presentations  about  their  programs. 

Universities 

In  1989  there  were  just  over  2  million  students  enrolled  in  Japan's 
490  universities.  At  the  top  of  the  higher  education  structure,  these 
institutions  provided  four-year  training  leading  to  a  bachelor's 
degree,  and  some  offered  six-year  programs  leading  to  a  profes- 
sional degree.  There  were  two  types  of  public  four-year  colleges: 
the  95  national  universities  (including  the  University  of  the  Air) 
and  the  38  local  public  universities,  founded  by  prefectures  and 
municipalities.  The  357  remaining  four-year  colleges  were  private 
(see  table  7,  Appendix). 

The  overwhelming  majority  of  college  students  attended  full-time 
day  programs.  In  1988  the  most  popular  courses,  enrolling  almost 
40  percent  of  all  undergraduate  students,  were  in  the  social  sciences, 
including  business,  law,  and  accounting.  Other  popular  subjects 
were  engineering  (20  percent),  the  humanities  (15  percent),  and 
education  (7.5  percent).

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

The  average  costs  (tuition,  fees,  and  living  expenses)  for  a  year 
of  higher  education  in  1986  were  ¥1.4  million  (US$10,000),  of 
which  parents  paid  a  little  less  than  80  percent,  or  about  20  per- 
cent of  the  average  family's  income  in  1986.  To  help  defray  ex- 
penses, students  frequently  worked  part-time  or  borrowed  money 
through  the  government-supported  Japan  Scholarship  Association. 
Assistance  also  was  offered  by  local  governments,  nonprofit  cor- 
porations, and  other  institutions. 

In  1988  women  accounted  for  about  26  percent  of  all  university 
undergraduates,  and  their  numbers  were  slowly  increasing.  Wom- 
en's choices  of  majors  and  programs  of  study  still  tended  to  follow 
traditional  patterns,  with  more  than  two-thirds  of  all  women  en- 
rolled in  education,  social  sciences,  or  humanities  courses.  Only 
15  percent  studied  scientific  and  technical  subjects,  and  women 
represented  less  than  3  percent  of  students  in  engineering,  the  most 
popular  subject  for  men. 

Junior  Colleges 

Junior  colleges — mainly  private  institutions — were  a  legacy  of 
the  occupation  period;  many  had  been  prewar  institutions  upgraded 
to  college  status  at  that  time.  More  than  90  percent  of  the  students 
in  junior  colleges  were  women,  and  higher  education  for  women 
was  still  largely  perceived  as  preparation  for  marriage  or  for  a  short- 
term  career  before  marriage.  Junior  colleges  provided  many  women 
with  social  credentials  as  well  as  education  and  some  career  op- 
portunities. These  colleges  frequently  emphasized  home  econom- 
ics, nursing,  teaching,  the  humanities,  and  social  sciences  in  their 
curricula. 

Special  Training  Schools 

Advanced  courses  in  special  training  schools  required  upper- 
secondary- school  graduation.  These  schools  offered  training  in 
specific  skills,  such  as  computer  science  and  vocational  training, 
and  they  enrolled  a  large  number  of  men.  Some  students  attended 
these  schools  in  addition  to  attending  a  university;  others  went  to 
qualify  for  technical  licenses  or  certification.  The  prestige  of  spe- 
cial training  schools  was  lower  than  that  of  universities,  but  gradu- 
ates, particularly  in  technical  areas,  were  readily  absorbed  by  the 
job  market. 

Miscellaneous  Schools 

In  1988  there  were  about  3,700  predominantly  private  "miscel- 
laneous schools,"  whose  attendance  did  not  require  upper- 
secondary  school  graduation.  Miscellaneous  schools  offered  a  variety 


156 


Students  at  Shokutoku  Junior  College

of  courses  in  such  programs  as  medical  treatment,  education,  so- 
cial welfare,  and  hygiene,  diversifying  practical  postsecondary  train- 
ing and  responding  to  social  and  economic  demands  for  certain 
skills. 

Technical  Colleges 

Most  technical  colleges  were  national  institutions  established  to 
train  highly  skilled  technicians  in  five-year  programs  in  a  number 
of  fields,  including  the  merchant  marine.  Sixty- two  of  these  schools 
had  been  operating  since  the  early  1960s.  About  10  percent  of  tech- 
nical college  graduates  transferred  to  universities  as  third-year  stu- 
dents, and  some  universities,  notably  the  University  of  Tokyo  and 
Tokyo  Institute  of  Technology,  earmarked  entrance  places  for  these 
transfer  students  in  the  1980s. 

Graduate  Education  and  Research 

Graduate  schools  became  a  part  of  the  formal  higher  education 
system  only  after  World  War  II  and  were  still  not  stressed  in  1990. 
Even  though  60  percent  of  all  universities  had  graduate  schools, 
only  7  percent  of  university  graduates  advanced  to  master's  pro- 
grams, and  total  graduate  school  enrollment  was  about  4  percent 
of  the  entire  university  student  population. 


157 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


The  pattern  of  graduate  enrollment  was  almost  the  opposite  of 
that  of  undergraduates:  the  majority  (63  percent)  of  all  graduate 
students  were  enrolled  in  the  national  universities,  and  it  appeared 
that  the  disparity  between  public  and  private  graduate  enrollments 
was  widening.  Graduate  education  was  largely  a  male  preserve, 
and  women,  particularly  at  the  master's  level,  were  most  heavily 
represented  in  the  humanities,  social  sciences,  and  education.  Men, 
on  the  other  hand,  were  frequently  found  in  engineering  programs 
where,  at  the  master's  level,  women  comprised  only  2  percent  of 
the  students.  At  the  doctoral  level,  the  two  highest  levels  of  female 
enrollment  were  found  in  medical  programs  and  the  humanities, 
where  in  both  fields  30  percent  of  doctoral  students  were  women. 
Women  accounted  for  about  13  percent  of  all  doctoral  enrollments. 

The  generally  small  numbers  of  graduate  students  and  the  gradu- 
ate enrollment  profile  resulted  from  a  number  of  factors,  especially 
the  traditional  employment  pattern  of  industry.  The  private  sec- 
tor frequently  preferred  to  hire  and  train  new  university  gradu- 
ates, allowing  them  to  develop  their  research  skills  within  the 
corporate  structure.  Thus,  the  demand  for  students  with  advanced 
degrees  was  low. 

The  Ministry  of  Education,  Science,  and  Culture 

The  Ministry  of  Education,  Science,  and  Culture  was  the  primary 
authority  over  higher  education.  It  approved  the  establishment  of 
all  new  institutions,  both  public  and  private,  and  directly  controlled 
the  budgets  of  all  national  institutions  and  their  affiliated  research 
institutes.  In  addition,  the  ministry  regulated  many  aspects  of  the 
university  environment,  including  standards  for  academics  and 
physical  plants  and  facilities.  The  ministry  also  provided  subsidies 
to  private  higher  education  institutions  for  both  operation  and 
equipment  and  made  long-term  loans  for  physical  plant  im- 
provement. 

Government  appropriations  were  the  largest  source  of  funds  for 
national  universities  (over  75  percent),  and  tuition  and  fees  provided 
most  revenues  for  private  schools  (about  66  percent),  with  subsi- 
dies accounting  for  another  10  to  15  percent  for  the  private  schools. 
The  1975  Private  School  Promotion  Law  allowed  the  government 
to  subsidize  private  education  and  increased  the  ministry's  authority 
over  private  schools,  but  the  ministry's  own  budgetary  limits  and 
general  fiscal  restraint  have  tended  to  limit  such  subsidies,  which 
remained  relatively  low.  In  FY  1988,  for  example,  only  ¥244  bil- 
lion of  the  total  ministry  budget  of  ¥4.6  trillion  went  for  this  purpose. 

The  Ministry  of  Education  had  two  major  areas  of  responsibil- 
ity related  to  graduate  education  and  research.  In  addition  to  being 


158 


Education  and  the  Arts 


generally  responsible  for  the  national  universities  and  establishing 
their  research  institutes,  the  ministry  also  promoted  the  research 
conducted  at  universities  and  funded  both  institutions  and  indi- 
viduals. About  a  half-dozen  research  institutes,  such  as  the  Na- 
tional Institute  for  Educational  Research  and  the  National  Institute 
for  Special  Education,  were  also  under  direct  ministry  supervision. 
Several  types  of  research  organizations  were  affiliated  with  uni- 
versities: the  national  research  institutes  attached  to  national  uni- 
versities, independent  research  facilities  affiliated  with  national 
universities  but  open  to  researchers  from  universities  throughout 
Japan,  other  research  centers,  and  other  facilities  at  national,  local, 
public,  and  private  universities. 

The  ministry  was  not  the  exclusive  agent  for  funding  and  promot- 
ing research,  but  it  accounted  for  about  half  of  the  entire  govern- 
ment budget  for  research  throughout  most  of  the  1980s.  In  addition 
to  providing  funds  for  research  institutes  and  national  universi- 
ties, the  ministry  gave  smaller  amounts  for  scientific  grants  and 
programs  in  other  public  and  private  institutions. 

The  ministry  could  devote  funds  to  particular  areas  of  research 
that  it  considered  important.  In  FY  1988,  space  science,  particu- 
larly scientific  satellites,  rockets,  and  astronomy,  high-energy  phys- 
ics and  accelerator  experiments,  and  the  construction  of  a  national 
research  and  development  information  network  were  programs  that 
the  ministry  emphasized  in  its  budget. 

Reform 

The  quality  of  undergraduate  and  graduate  education  was  the 
subject  of  widespread  criticism  in  the  1980s,  and  its  improvement 
was  one  of  the  focal  points  of  university  reform.  One  complaint 
was  that  students,  once  admitted,  had  little  incentive  to  study  be- 
cause graduation  was  virtually  automatic.  There  were  few  atten- 
dance requirements  and,  except  for  examinations,  students  were 
free  to  come  and  go  as  they  pleased.  There  was  poor  teaching,  and 
little  study.  Students  and  the  system  were  accused  of  squandering 
the  four  years. 

In  response  to  the  call  for  university  reform  in  the  reports  of  the 
National  Council  on  Educational  Reform,  the  ministry  founded 
the  University  Council  in  1987.  High  on  the  council's  agenda  were 
the  diversification  and  reform  of  graduate  education,  improvement 
in  the  management  and  organization  of  universities,  and  the  de- 
velopment of  a  policy  for  lifelong  education  and  diversification  in 
educational  activities.  The  recommendations  that  had  emerged  by 
1989  included  improvements  in  the  provision  of  private  financial 
support  to  universities  and  modified  personnel  practices  for  college 


159

instructors  in  the  national  schools.  There  were  calls  for  better  in- 
formation and  data-processing  education  and  for  the  establishment 
or  reorganization  of  departments  and  research  faculties  in  those 
fields.  Finally,  in  the  area  of  lifelong  education,  changes  under  dis- 
cussion were  the  provision  of  more  public  lectures,  expansion  of 
university  entrance  opportunities  for  the  general  adult  population, 
improvements  in  the  University  of  the  Air,  and  better  school- 
community  links. 

The  University  of  the  Air,  which  had  no  entrance  requirements, 
was  originally  designed  to  give  all  Japanese  access  to  higher  edu- 
cation through  radio  and  television  broadcasts.  Although  it  was 
hampered  by  limited  broadcast  radius  and  frequencies,  it  had  a 
potential  leading  role  in  promoting  lifelong  learning  (see  Social  Edu- 
cation, this  ch.). 

Internationalization  was  an  issue  for  every  education  level,  but 
particularly  for  higher  education.  The  number  of  students  study- 
ing in  Japan  from  foreign  countries,  especially  Asian  countries, 
was  increasing,  and  the  higher  education  structure  was  not  partic- 
ularly well-equipped  to  deal  with  them.  In  1988  approximately 
25,000  foreign  students  from  more  than  100  countries  were  study- 
ing in  Japanese  universities  and  colleges,  and  the  ministry  expected 
the  figure  to  be  100,000  by  the  beginning  of  the  twenty-first  cen- 
tury. The  ministry  was  also  working  to  regulate  and  improve  the 
standards  for  teaching  Japanese  to  foreign  students  and  trying  to 
improve  their  financial  and  living  arrangements.  During  the  1980s, 
Japanese  universities  established  branches  in  the  United  States, 
and  many  American  schools  also  set  up  Japanese  branches.  At  least 
one  Japanese  women's  university  began  to  require  its  undergradu- 
ates to  spend  a  semester  on  the  campus  of  an  affiliated  school  in 
the  United  States. 

As  in  virtually  every  other  area  of  education,  debate  over  re- 
form of  graduate  education  and  research  was  widespread  at  the 
end  of  the  1980s.  The  University  Council  established  a  subcom- 
mittee on  graduate  schools  consisting  of  academics,  researchers, 
and  corporate  executives.  The  subcommittee  identified  a  number 
of  critical  issues:  establishing  graduate  schools  that  were  indepen- 
dent of  traditional  university  structures,  founding  new  and  special- 
ized graduate  schools,  reconsidering  entrance  and  graduation 
criteria,  increasing  the  international  student  population  and  inter- 
nationalizing graduate  education,  addressing  the  qualifications  of 
graduate  school  faculties,  modifying  the  mission  of  doctoral  courses, 
arranging  for  flexibility  in  admissions  to  graduate  school,  stan- 
dardizing the  length  of  graduate  programs  and  reconciling  the  var- 
iations between  degrees  awarded  by  different  schools  and  in  different 


160 


Education  and  the  Arts 


disciplines,  establishing  an  accreditation  and  evaluation  system, 
and  reviewing  the  financial  situation  of  graduate  students.  These 
recommendations  were  acknowledged  in  the  ministry's  FY  1988 
budget,  which  included  funds  for  expanding  student  aid  programs, 
reforming  graduate  programs,  and  establishing  a  new  Graduate 
School  for  Advanced  Studies.  Proposed  reform  of  the  research  sys- 
tem concentrated  on  improving  cooperation  between  universities 
and  the  private  sector,  and  between  universities  and  other  insti- 
tutions. 

Finally,  the  subcommittee  recommended  greater  Japanese  par- 
ticipation and  cooperation  in  international  projects  and  greater 
efforts  to  make  Japanese  scientific  and  technical  literature  avail- 
able in  English.  Although  there  were  more  programs  for  interna- 
tional scholarly  exchange  and  more  foreign  researchers  and  foreign 
graduate  students  in  Japan  than  in  the  past,  Japanese  society  and 
education  institutions  were  still  having  some  difficulties  in  accom- 
modating them  smoothly. 

Some  of  the  urgency  behind  considering  reforms  in  graduate  edu- 
cation and  research  came  from  the  recognition  that  Japan  was  in- 
creasingly involved  in  advanced  research  and  was  no  longer  assured 
of  having  foreign  models  to  study.  To  remain  competitive  and  to 
guarantee  its  future,  Japan  would  need  to  make  serious  changes 
in  its  education  and  research  structures.  Its  institutions  would  have 
to  be  more  flexible  and  diverse,  and  encourage  the  creativity  in 
education  that  would  foster  new  technology.  This  need  was  seen 
to  require  a  national  effort,  one  not  limited  to  the  graduate  sector. 

Social  Education 

Modern  Japan  is  unquestionably  a  society  that  values  educa- 
tion highly.  Nowhere  in  the  1980s  was  this  better  reflected  than 
in  "social  education,"  as  the  Japanese  called  nondegree-oriented 
education.  Diverse  institutions,  such  as  the  miscellaneous  schools, 
provided  these  services.  Large  newspaper  companies  sponsored  cul- 
tural centers  that  offered  ongoing  programs  of  informal  education, 
department  stores  organized  curricula  covering  everything  from 
cooking  classes  to  music,  English  conversation,  and  Japanese  poetry. 

"Lifelong learning,"  another  term  for  social  education,  was  also 
a  key  phrase  in  the  education  reforms  of  the  late  1980s.  The  respon- 
sibility for  social  education  was  shared  by  all  levels  of  government, 
but  especially  local  government.  Local  governments  also  were 
largely  responsible  for  such  public  facilities  as  libraries  and  mu- 
seums, basic  resources  in  social  education  (see  table  8,  Appendix). 
The  ministry  was  interested  in  increasing  the  use  of  public  school 
facilities  for  lifelong  learning  activities,  increasing  the  number  of 


161 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

social  education  facilities,  training  staff,  and  disseminating  infor- 
mation about  lifelong  learning  opportunities. 

The  Japanese  are  voracious  readers.  In  the  1980s,  well-known 
bookstores  were  full  from  the  moment  they  opened  their  doors  each 
day  with  readers  seeking  books  from  a  staggering  range  of  foreign 
as  well  as  Japanese  titles.  The  top  four  national  newspapers  alone 
had  a  combined  daily  circulation  (with  two  editions  each  day)  of 
over  35  million,  and  there  were  four  daily  English-language  papers 
as  well. 

Although  education  in  Japan  in  1990  was  in  transition  in  many 
regards,  it  still  retained  its  postwar  organizational  structure.  Even 
with  growing  pressure  for  reforms  and  for  more  emphasis  on  in- 
dividuality and  internationalization  in  education,  it  was  clear  that 
educational  changes  would  be  a  unique  amalgam  of  traditional 
values  and  modern  innovations. 

The  Arts 

The  introduction  of  Western  cultural  values,  which  had  flooded 
Japan  by  the  late  nineteenth  century,  led  to  a  dichotomy  develop- 
ing between  traditional  values  and  the  attempts  to  duplicate  and 
assimilate  a  variety  of  clashing  new  ideas.  This  split  remained  evi- 
dent in  the  late  twentieth  century,  although  much  synthesis  had 
occurred,  which  had  created  an  international  cultural  atmosphere 
and  stimulated  contemporary  Japanese  arts  toward  ever  more  in- 
novative forms. 

Japan's  aesthetic  conceptions,  deriving  from  diverse  cultural  tra- 
ditions, have  been  formative  in  the  production  of  unique  art  forms, 
all  of  which  are  characterized  by  an  overwhelming  technical  per- 
fection. Over  the  centuries,  a  wide  range  of  artistic  motifs  devel- 
oped and  were  refined,  becoming  imbued  with  symbolic  significance 
and  acquiring  many  layers  of  meaning.  Japanese  aesthetics  pro- 
vide a  key  to  understanding  artistic  works  perceivably  different  from 
those  coming  from  Western  traditions. 

Within  the  East  Asian  artistic  tradition,  China  has  been  the  ac- 
knowledged teacher  and  Japan  the  devoted  student.  Nevertheless, 
Japanese  arts  developed  their  own  style,  which  can  be  clearly  differen- 
tiated from  the  Chinese.  The  monumental,  symmetrically  balanced, 
rational  approach  of  Chinese  art  forms  became  miniaturized,  irregu- 
lar, and  subdy  suggestive  in  Japanese  hands.  Miniature  rock  gardens, 
diminutive  plants  (bonsai),  and  flower  arrangements,  in  which  the 
selected  few  represented  a  garden,  were  the  favorite  pursuits  of  re- 
fined aristocrats  for  a  millennium,  and  they  have  remained  a  part 
of  contemporary  cultural  life.

The  diagonal,  reflecting  a  natural  flow,  rather  than  the  fixed  tri- 
angle became  the  favored  structural  device,  whether  in  painting, 
architectural  or  garden  design,  dance  steps,  or  musical  notations. 
Odd  numbers  replace  even  ones  in  the  regularity  of  a  Chinese 
master  pattern,  and  a  pull  to  one  side  allows  a  motif  to  turn  the 
corner  of  a  three-dimensional  object,  thus  giving  continuity  and 
motion  that  is  lacking  in  a  static  frontal  design.  Japanese  painters 
used  the  devices  of  the  cutoff,  close-up,  and  fade-out  by  the  twelfth 
century  in  yamato-e,  or  Japanese-style,  scroll  painting,  perhaps  one 
reason  why  modern  filmmaking  has  been  such  a  natural  and 
successful  art  form  in  Japan.  Suggestion  is  used  rather  than  direct 
statement;  oblique  poetic  hints,  allusive,  inconclusive  melodies  and 
thoughts — all  have  proved  frustrating  to  the  Westerner  trying  to 
penetrate  the  meanings  of  literature,  music,  painting,  and  even 
everyday  language. 

The  Japanese  began  defining  such  aesthetic  ideas  in  a  number 
of  evocative  phrases  by  at  least  the  tenth  or  eleventh  centuries.  The 
courtly  refinements  of  the  aristocratic  Heian  period  evolved  into 
the  elegant  simplicity  seen  as  the  essence  of  good  taste  in  the  under- 
stated art  that  is  called  shibui  (see  Nara  and  Heian  Periods,  710- 
1185,  ch.  1).  Two  terms  originating  from  Zen  Buddhist  medita- 
tive practices  describe  degrees  of  tranquility:  one,  the  repose  found 
in  humble  melancholy  (wabi),  the  other,  the  serenity  accompany- 
ing the  enjoyment  of  subdued  beauty  (sabi).  Zen  thought  also

contributed  a  penchant  for  combining  the  unexpected  or  startling, 
used  to  jolt  one's  consciousness  toward  the  goal  of  enlightenment: 
in  art,  this  approach  was  expressed  in  combinations  of  such  un- 
likely materials  as  lead  inlaid  in  lacquer  and  in  clashing  poetic  im- 
agery. Unexpectedly  humorous  and  sometimes  grotesque  images 
and  motifs  also  stem  from  the  Zen  koan  (conundrum).  Although 
the  arts  have  been  mainly  secular  since  the  Tokugawa  period,  tradi- 
tional aesthetics  and  training  methods,  stemming  generally  from 
religious  sources,  continue  to  underlie  artistic  productions  (see 
Tokugawa  Period,  1600-1867,  ch.  1). 

In  the  Meiji  period  (1868-1912),  Western  art  forms  came  into 
Japan  and  were  studied  with  intense  interest  by  Japanese  artists, 
who  quickly  imitated  a  variety  of  European  models.  By  the  early 
twentieth  century,  a  period  of  assimilation  began  as  techniques  were 
mastered  and  the  new  forms  of  literature  and  the  visual  and  per- 
forming arts  were  adapted.  Artists  divided  into  two  main  camps, 
those  continuing  in  traditional  Japanese  style  and  those  who  whole- 
heartedly studied  the  new  Western  culture.  By  the  late  1920s,  a 
generation  of  Japanese  artists  had  synthesized  Western  and 
Japanese  artistic  conceptions.  Oil  painters  used  the  calligraphic, 
black  lines  of  traditional  Japanese  brushwork,  and  musicians  used 
the  Asian  tonal  system  and  instruments  to  create  a  concerto,  while 
new  theaters  dealt  with  social  themes  in  the  allusive  traditional  liter- 
ary style.  Artists  employing  Western  forms  were  accused  of  im- 
itating rather  than  innovating.  Yet,  the  age-old  Asian  cultural 
tradition  has  always  entailed  copying  a  master's  style  until  it  has 
been  perfected,  which  explains  why  so  much  so-called  "imitative 
art"  was  produced.  Japan  produced  much  vibrant  and  unique  new 
art  through  such  exchanges. 

After  World  War  II,  many  artists  began  working  in  art  forms 
deriving  from  the  international  scene,  moving  away  from  local  ar- 
tistic developments  into  the  mainstream  of  world  art.  But  tradi- 
tional Japanese  conceptions  endured,  particularly  in  the  use  of 
modular  space  in  architecture  and  certain  spacing  intervals  in  music 
and  dance,  and  a  propensity  for  certain  color  combinations  and 
characteristic  literary  forms.  The  wide  variety  of  art  forms  avail- 
able to  the  Japanese  in  the  1990s  reflected  the  vigorous  state  of 
the  arts,  widely  supported  by  the  Japanese  people  and  promoted 
by  the  government. 

Traditionally,  the  artist  was  a  vehicle  for  expression  and  was  per- 
sonally reticent,  in  keeping  with  the  role  of  an  artisan  or  enter- 
tainer of  low  social  status.  The  calligrapher — a  member  of  the 
Confucian  literati  class,  or  samurai — did  have  a  higher  status,  while 
artists  of  great  genius  were  often  recognized  in  the  medieval  period

by  receiving  a  name  from  a  feudal  lord  and  thus  rising  socially  (see 
The  Kamakura  and  Muromachi  Periods,  1185-1573,  ch.  1).  The 
performing  arts,  however,  were  generally  held  in  less  esteem,  and 
the  purported  immorality  of  actresses  of  the  early  Kabuki  theater 
caused  the  Tokugawa  government  to  bar  women  from  the  stage; 
female  roles  in  Kabuki  and  No  thereafter  were  played  by  men  (see 
The  Bakufu  and  the  Hqjo  Regency,  ch.  1). 

In  the  early  1990s,  there  were  a  number  of  specialized  universi- 
ties for  the  arts,  led  by  the  national  universities.  The  most  impor- 
tant was  the  prestigious  Tokyo  Arts  University,  said  to  be  the  most 
difficult  of  all  national  universities  to  enter.  Another  seminal  center 
was  Tama  Arts  University  in  Tokyo,  which  produced  many  of 
Japan's  late  twentieth-century  innovative  young  artists.  Traditional 
training  in  the  arts  remained:  experts  taught  from  their  homes  or 
headed  schools  working  within  a  master-pupil  relationship.  A  pupil 
did  not  experiment  with  a  personal  style  until  the  top  level  of  train- 
ing, or  graduation,  or  becoming  head  of  a  school.  Many  young 
artists  have  criticized  this  system  as  stifling  creativity  and  individu- 
ality. A  new  generation  of  the  avant-garde  has  broken  with  this 
tradition,  often  receiving  its  training  in  the  West.  In  the  traditional 
arts,  however,  the  master-pupil  system  preserved  the  secrets  and 
skills  of  the  past.  Some  master-pupil  lineages  could  be  traced  to 
the  medieval  period,  from  which  they  continued  to  use  a  great 
master's  style  or  theme.  Japanese  artists  considered  technical  vir- 
tuosity as  the  sine  qua  non  of  their  professions,  a  fact  recognized 
by  the  rest  of  the  world  as  one  of  the  hallmarks  of  Japanese  art. 

The  national  government  has  actively  supported  the  arts  through 
the  Agency  for  Cultural  Affairs,  set  up  in  1968  as  a  special  body 
of  the  Ministry  of  Education.  The  agency's  budget  for  FY  1989 
rose  to  ¥37.8  billion  after  five  years  of  budget  cuts,  but  still 
represented  much  less  than  1  percent  of  the  general  budget.  The 
agency's  Cultural  Affairs  Division  disseminated  information  about 
the  arts  within  Japan  and  internationally,  and  the  Cultural  Proper- 
ties Protection  Division  protected  the  nation's  cultural  heritage. 
The  Cultural  Affairs  Division  was  concerned  with  such  areas  as 
art  and  culture  promotion,  arts  copyrights,  and  improvements  in 
the  national  language.  It  also  supported  both  national  and  local 
arts  and  cultural  festivals,  and  funded  traveling  cultural  events  in 
music,  theater,  dance,  art  exhibitions,  and  filmmaking.  Special 
prizes  were  offered  to  encourage  young  artists  and  established  prac- 
titioners, and  some  grants  were  given  each  year  to  enable  them 
to  train  abroad.  The  agency  funded  national  museums  of  modern 
art  in  Kyoto  and  Tokyo  and  the  Museum  of  Western  Art  in  Tokyo, 
which  exhibited  both  Japanese  and  international  shows.  The  agency 


165 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

also  supported  the  Japan  Academy  of  Arts,  which  honored  emi- 
nent persons  of  arts  and  letters,  appointing  them  to  membership 
and  offering  ¥3.5  million  in  prize  money.  Awards  were  made  in 
the  presence  of  the  emperor,  who  would  personally  bestow  the 
highest  accolade,  the  Cultural  Medal.  In  1989  the  fifth  woman  ever 
to  be  so  distinguished  was  cited  for  Japanese-style  painting,  while 
for  the  first  time  two  women — a  writer  and  a  costume  designer — 
were  nominated  for  the  Order  of  Cultural  Merit,  another  official 
honor  carrying  the  same  stipend. 

The  Cultural  Properties  Protection  Division  originally  was  es- 
tablished to  oversee  restorations  after  World  War  II.  In  1989  it 
was  responsible  for  over  2,500  historic  sites,  including  the  ancient 
capitals  of  Asuka,  Heijokyo,  and  Fujiwara,  more  than  275  scenic 
places,  and  nearly  1,000  national  monuments,  and  for  such  in- 
digenous fauna  as  ibis  and  storks.  As  of  1989,  some  1,000  build- 
ings, paintings,  sculptures,  and  other  art  forms  had  been  designated 
National  Treasures.  In  addition,  about  1 1 ,500  items  had  the  lesser 
designation  of  Important  Cultural  Properties,  with  buildings  ac- 
counting for  the  largest  share,  closely  followed  by  sculpture  and 
craft  objects. 

The  government  also  protected  buried  properties,  of  which  some 
300,000  had  been  identified.  During  the  1980s,  many  important 
prehistoric  and  historic  sites  were  investigated  by  the  archaeologi- 
cal institutes  that  the  agency  funded,  resulting  in  about  2,000  ex- 
cavations in  1989.  The  wealth  of  material  unearthed  shed  new  light 
on  the  controversial  period  of  the  formation  of  the  Japanese  state 
(see  Early  Developments,  ch.  1). 

A  1975  amendment  to  the  Cultural  Properties  Protection  Act 
of  1897  enabled  the  Agency  for  Cultural  Affairs  to  designate  tradi- 
tional areas  and  buildings  in  urban  centers  for  preservation.  From 
time  to  time,  various  endangered  traditional  artistic  skills  were 
added  to  the  agency's  preservation  roster,  such  as  the  1989  inclu- 
sion of  a  kind  of  ancient  doll  making. 

One  of  the  most  important  roles  of  the  Cultural  Properties  Pro- 
tection Division  was  to  preserve  the  traditional  arts  and  crafts  and 
performing  arts  through  their  living  exemplars.  Individual  artists 
and  groups,  such  as  a  dance  troupe  or  a  pottery  village,  were  desig- 
nated as  mukei  bunkazai  (intangible  cultural  assets)  in  recognition  of 
their  skill.  Major  exponents  of  the  traditional  arts  have  been  desig- 
nated as  ningen  kokuhd  (living  national  treasures).  About  seventy  per- 
sons are  so  honored  at  any  one  time;  in  1989  the  six  newly  designated 
masters  were  a  kyogen  (comic)  performer,  a  chanter  of  bunraku  (pup- 
pet) theater,  a  performer  of  the  nagauta  samisen  (a  special  kind  of 
stringed  instrument),  the  head  potter  making  Nabeshima  decorated

porcelain  ware,  the  top  pictorial  lacquer-ware  artist,  and  a  metal- 
work  expert.  Each  was  provided  a  lifetime  annual  pension  of  ¥2 
million  and  financial  aid  for  training  disciples. 

The  national  museums  of  Japanese  and  Asian  art  in  Tokyo, 
Kyoto,  Nara,  and  Osaka,  the  cultural  properties  research  institutes 
at  Tokyo  and  Nara,  the  national  theaters,  the  Ethnological  Mu- 
seum, the  National  Museum  of  History  and  Folk  Culture,  and  the 
National  Storehouse  for  Fine  Arts  all  came  under  the  aegis  of  the 
Cultural  Properties  Protection  Division.  During  the  1980s,  the  Na- 
tional No  Theater  and  the  National  Bunraku  Theater  were  con- 
structed by  the  government. 

Arts  patronage  and  promotion  by  the  government  were  broad- 
ened to  include  a  new  cooperative  effort  with  corporate  Japan  to 
provide  funding  beyond  the  tight  budget  of  the  Agency  for  Cul- 
tural Affairs.  Many  other  public  and  private  institutions  partici- 
pated, especially  in  the  burgeoning  field  of  awarding  arts  prizes. 
A  growing  number  of  large  corporations  joined  major  newspapers 
in  sponsoring  exhibitions  and  performances  and  in  giving  yearly 
prizes.  The  most  important  of  the  many  literary  awards  given  were 
the  venerable  Naoki  Prize  and  the  Akutagawa  Prize,  the  latter  being 
the  equivalent  of  the  Pulitzer  Prize  in  the  United  States.  In  1989 
an  effort  to  promote  cross-cultural  exchange  led  to  the  establish- 
ment of  a  Japanese  "  Nobel  Prize"  for  the  arts — the  Premium  Im- 
periale — by  the  Japan  Art  Association.  This  prize  of  US$100,000 
was  funded  largely  by  the  mass  media  conglomerate  Fuji-Sankei 
and  awarded  on  a  world-wide  selection  basis. 

A  number  of  foundations  promoting  the  arts  arose  in  the  1980s, 
including  the  new  Cultural  Properties  Foundation  set  up  to  preserve 
historic  sites  overseas,  especially  along  the  Silk  Route  in  Inner  Asia 
and  at  Dunhuang  in  China.  Another  international  arrangement 
was  made  in  1988  with  the  United  States  Smithsonian  Institution 
for  cooperative  exchange  of  high-technology  studies  of  Asian  arti- 
facts. The  government  played  a  major  role  by  funding  the  Japan 
Foundation,  which  provided  both  institutional  and  individual 
grants,  effected  scholarly  exchanges,  awarded  annual  prizes,  sup- 
ported publications  and  exhibitions,  and  sent  traditional  Japanese 
arts  groups  to  perform  abroad.  The  Arts  Festival  held  for  two 
months  each  fall  for  all  the  performing  arts  was  sponsored  by  the 
Agency  for  Cultural  Affairs.  Major  cities  also  provided  substan- 
tial support  for  the  arts;  a  growing  number  in  the  1980s  had  built 
large  centers  for  the  performing  arts  and,  stimulated  by  govern- 
ment funding,  were  offering  prizes  such  as  the  Lafcadio  Hearn  Prize 
initiated  by  the  city  of  Matsue.  There  were  also  a  number  of  new 
municipal  museums  providing  about  one-third  more  facilities  in 


167

the  1980s  than  were  previously  available.  In  the  late  1980s,  Tokyo 
added  more  than  twenty  new  cultural  halls,  notably,  the  large  Cul- 
tural Village  built  by  Tokyu  Corporation  and  the  reconstruction 
of  Shakespeare's  Globe  Theater.  All  these  efforts  reflected  a  rising 
popular  enthusiasm  for  the  arts.  Japanese  art  buyers  swept  the 
Western  art  markets  in  the  late  1980s,  paying  record  highs  for  im- 
pressionist paintings  and  US$51.7  million  alone  for  one  blue  pe- 
riod Picasso. 

After  World  War  II,  artists  typically  gathered  in  arts  associa- 
tions, some  of  which  were  long-established  professional  societies 
while  others  reflected  the  latest  arts  movement.  The  Japan  Artists 
League,  for  example,  was  responsible  for  the  largest  number  of 
major  exhibitions  including  the  prestigious  annual  Nitten  (Japan 
Art  Exhibition).  The  P.E.N.  Club  of  Japan  (P.E.N,  stands  for 
prose,  essay,  and  narrative) — a  branch  of  an  international  writers' 
organization — was  the  largest  of  some  thirty  major  authors'  associ- 
ations. Actors,  dancers,  musicians,  and  other  kinds  of  performing 
artists  boasted  their  own  major  and  minor  societies,  including  the 
Kabuki  Society,  organized  in  1987  to  maintain  this  art's  traditional 
high  standards,  which  were  thought  to  be  endangered  by  modern 
innovation.  By  the  1980s,  however,  avant-garde  painters  and  sculp- 
tors had  eschewed  all  groups,  and  were  "unattached"  artists. 

Visual  Arts 

Architecture 

With  the  introduction  of  Western  building  techniques,  materials, 
and  styles  into  Meiji  Japan,  new  steel  and  concrete  structures  were 
built  in  strong  contrast  to  traditional  styles.  Japan  played  some  role 
in  modern  skyscraper  design  because  of  its  long  familiarity  with 
the  cantilever  principle  to  support  the  weight  of  heavy  tiled  tem- 
ple roofs.  Frank  Lloyd  Wright  was  strongly  influenced  by  Japanese 
spatial  arrangements  and  the  concept  of  interpenetrating  exterior 
and  interior  space,  long  achieved  in  Japan  by  opening  up  walls 
made  of  sliding  doors.  In  the  late  twentieth  century,  however,  only 
in  domestic  and  religious  architecture  was  Japanese  style  commonly 
employed.  Cities  bristled  with  modern  skyscrapers,  epitomized  by 
Tokyo's  crowded  skyline,  reflecting  a  total  assimilation  and  trans- 
formation of  modern  Western  forms. 

The  widespread  urban  planning  and  reconstruction  necessitated 
by  the  devastation  of  World  War  II  produced  such  major  architects 
as  Maekawa  Kunio  and  Tange  Kenzo.  Maekawa,  a  student  of 
world-famous  architect  Charles  LeCorbusier,  produced  thoroughly 
international,  functional  modern  works.  Tange,  who  worked  at  first 


168 


Education  and  the  Arts 

for  Maekawa,  supported  this  concept.  Both  were  notable  for  in- 
fusing Japanese  aesthetic  ideas  into  starkly  contemporary  build- 
ings, returning  to  the  spatial  concepts  and  modular  proportions 
of  tatami  (sleeping  mats),  using  textures  to  enliven  the  ubiquitous 
ferroconcrete  and  steel,  and  integrating  gardens  and  sculpture  into 
their  designs.  Tange  used  the  cantilever  principle  in  a  pillar  and 
beam  system  reminiscent  of  ancient  imperial  palaces;  the  pillar — 
a  hallmark  of  Japanese  traditional  monumental  timber  construc- 
tion— became  fundamental  to  his  designs.  Maki  Fumihiko  advanced 
new  city  planning  ideas  based  on  the  principle  of  layering  or  cocoon- 
ing  around  an  inner  space  (oku),  a  Japanese  spatial  concept  that 
was  adapted  to  urban  needs.  He  also  advocated  the  use  of  empty 
or  open  spaces  (ma),  a  Japanese  aesthetic  principle  reflecting  Bud- 
dhist spatial  ideas.  Another  quintessentially  Japanese  aesthetic  con- 
cept was  a  basis  for  Maki  designs,  which  focused  on  openings  onto 
intimate  garden  views  at  ground  level  while  cutting  off  ugly  sky- 
lines. A  dominant  1970s  architectural  concept,  the  "metabolism" 
of  convertibility,  provided  for  changing  the  functions  of  parts  of 
buildings  according  to  use,  and  has  remained  influential  in  the 
1990s. 

A  major  architect  of  the  1970s  and  1980s  was  Isozaki  Arata,  origi- 
nally a  student  and  associate  of  Tange' s,  who  also  based  his  style 
on  the  LeCorbusier  tradition  and  then  turned  his  attention  toward 
the  further  exploration  of  geometric  shapes  and  cubic  silhouettes. 
He  synthesized  Western  high-technology  building  concepts  with 
peculiarly  Japanese  spatial,  functional,  and  decorative  ideas  to  create 
a  modern  Japanese  style.  Isozaki' s  predilection  for  the  cubic  grid 
and  trabeated  pergola  in  large-scale  architecture,  for  the  semicircular 
vault  in  domestic- scale  buildings,  and  for  extended  barrel  vault- 
ing in  low,  elongated  buildings  led  to  a  number  of  striking  varia- 
tions. New  Wave  architects  of  the  1980s  were  influenced  by  his 
designs,  either  pushing  to  extend  his  balanced  style,  often  into  man- 
nerism, or  reacting  against  them. 

A  number  of  avant-garde  experimental  groups  were  encompassed 
in  the  New  Wave  of  the  late  1970s  and  the  1980s.  They  reexamined 
and  modified  the  formal  geometric  structural  ideas  of  modernism 
by  introducing  metaphysical  concepts,  producing  some  startling 
fantasy  effects  in  architectural  design.  In  contrast  to  these  innova- 
tors, the  experimental  poetic  minimalism  of  Ando  Tadao  embod- 
ied the  postmodernist  concerns  for  a  more  balanced,  humanistic 
approach  than  that  of  structural  modernism's  rigid  formulations. 
Ando's  buildings  provide  a  variety  of  light  sources,  including  ex- 
tensive use  of  glass  bricks  and  opening  up  spaces  to  the  outside 
air.  He  adapted  the  inner  courtyards  of  traditional  Osaka  houses 


169 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

to  new  urban  architecture,  using  open  stairways  and  bridges  to 
lessen  the  sealed  atmosphere  of  the  standard  city  dwelling.  His  ideas 
became  ubiquitous  in  the  1980s,  when  buildings  were  commonly 
planned  around  open  courtyards  or  plazas,  often  with  stepped  and 
terraced  spaces,  pedestrian  walkways,  or  bridges  connecting  build- 
ing complexes.  In  1989  Ando  became  the  third  Japanese  to  receive 
France's  Prix  de  L'Academie  d' Architecture,  an  indication  of  the 
international  strength  of  the  major  Japanese  architects,  all  of  whom 
produced  important  structures  abroad  during  the  1980s.  Japanese 
architects  were  not  only  skilled  practitioners  in  the  modern  idiom 
but  also  enriched  postmodern  designs  worldwide  with  innovative 
spatial  perceptions,  subtle  surface  texturing,  unusual  use  of  indus- 
trial materials,  and  a  developed  awareness  of  ecological  and  topo- 
graphical problems. 

Sculpture 

Japanese  sculpture  derived  from  Shinto  funerary  and  Buddhist 
religious  arts,  and  developed  portrait  sculpture  only  as  a  memorial 
to  a  shrine  patron  or  temple  founder.  Materials  traditionally  used 
were  metal — especially  bronze — and,  more  commonly,  wood,  often 
lacquered,  gilded,  or  brightiy  painted.  By  the  end  of  the  Tokugawa 
period,  such  traditional  sculpture — except  for  miniaturized  works — 
had  largely  disappeared  because  of  the  loss  of  patronage  by  Bud- 
dhist temples  and  the  nobility. 

The  stimulus  of  Western  art  forms  returned  sculpture  to  the 
Japanese  art  scene  and  introduced  the  plaster  cast,  outdoor  heroic 
sculpture,  and  the  school  of  Paris  concept  of  sculpture  as  an  "art 
form."  Such  ideas  adapted  in  Japan  during  the  late  nineteenth  cen- 
tury, together  with  the  return  of  state  patronage,  rejuvenated  sculp- 
ture. After  World  War  II,  sculptors  turned  away  from  the  figurative 
French  school  of  Rodin  and  Maillol  toward  aggressive  modern  and 
avant-garde  forms  and  materials,  sometimes  on  an  enormous  scale. 
A  profusion  of  materials  and  techniques  characterized  these  new 
experimental  sculptures,  which  also  absorbed  the  ideas  of  inter- 
national "op"  (optical  illusion)  and  "pop"  (popular  motif)  art. 
A  number  of  innovative  artists  were  both  sculptors  and  painters 
or  printmakers,  their  new  theories  cutting  across  material  boun- 
daries. 

In  the  1970s,  the  ideas  of  contextual  placement  of  natural  ob- 
jects of  stone,  wood,  bamboo,  and  paper  into  relationships  with 
people  and  their  environment  were  embodied  in  the  mono-ha  school. 
These  artists  emphasized  materiality  as  the  most  important  aspect 
of  art  and  brought  to  an  end  the  antiformalism  that  had  dominated 
the  avant-garde  in  the  preceding  two  decades.  This  focus  on  the 


170

relationships  between  objects  and  people  was  ubiquitous  through- 
out the  arts  world  and  led  to  a  rising  appreciation  of  "Japanese" 
qualities  in  the  environment  and  a  return  to  native  artistic  princi- 
ples and  forms.  Among  these  precepts  were  a  reverence  for  nature 
and  various  Buddhist  concepts  brought  into  play  by  architects  to 
treat  time/space  problems.  Western  ideology  was  carefully  re- 
examined, and  much  was  rejected  as  artists  turned  to  their  own 
environment — both  inward  and  outward — for  sustenance  and  in- 
spiration. From  the  late  1970s  through  the  late  1980s,  artists  began 
to  create  a  vital  new  art,  which  was  both  contemporary  and  Asian 
in  sources  and  expression  but  still  very  much  a  part  of  the  interna- 
tional scene.  These  artists  focused  on  projecting  their  own  individu- 
alism and  national  styles  rather  than  on  adapting  or  synthesizing 
Western  ideas  exclusively. 

Outdoor  sculpture,  which  came  to  the  fore  with  the  advent  of  the 
Hakone  Open- Air  Museum  in  1969,  was  widely  used  in  the  1980s, 
and  cities  supported  enormous  outdoor  sculptures  for  parks  and 
plazas,  and  major  architects  planned  for  sculpture  in  their  build- 
ings and  urban  layouts.  Outdoor  museums  and  exhibitions 
burgeoned,  stressing  the  natural  placement  of  sculpture  in  the  en- 
vironment. Since  hard  sculpture  stone  is  not  native  to  Japan,  most 
outdoor  pieces  were  created  from  stainless  steel,  plastic,  or  aluminum

for  "tension  and  compression"  machine  constructions  of  mirror- 
surfaced  steel  or  for  elegant,  polished- aluminum,  ultramodern 
shapes.  The  strong  influence  of  modern  high  technology  on  the 
artists  resulted  in  experimentation  with  kinetic,  tensile  forms,  such 
as  flexible  arcs  and  "info-environmental"  sculptures  using  lights. 
Video  components  and  video  art  developed  rapidly  from  the  late 
1970s  throughout  the  1980s.  The  new  Japanese  experimental  sculp- 
tors could  be  understood  as  working  with  Buddhist  ideas  of  perme- 
ability and  regeneration  in  structuring  their  forms,  a  contrast  to 
the  general  Western  conception  of  sculpture  as  something  with  finite 
and  permanent  contours. 

In  the  1980s,  wood  and  natural  materials  were  used  prominently 
by  many  sculptors,  who  now  began  to  place  their  works  in  inner 
courtyards  and  enclosed  spaces.  Also,  a  Japanese  feeling  for  rhyth- 
mic motion,  captured  in  recurring  forms  as  a  "systematic  gestural 
motion,"  was  used  by  both  long-established  artists  like  Kiyomizu 
Kyubei  and  Nagasawa  Hidetoshi  and  the  younger  generation 
spearheaded  by  Toya  Shigeo.  The  1970s  search  for  a  national  iden- 
tity led  to  a  renewed  understanding  of  Japanese  forms,  spatial 
perceptions,  rhythms,  and  philosophical  conceptions,  which  re- 
invigorated  Japanese  sculpture  in  the  1980s. 

Painting 

Painting  is  one  of  the  oldest  and  most  highly  refined  of  Japanese 
arts,  stemming  from  classic  continental  traditions  of  the  early  histor- 
ical period  (sixth- seventh  centuries  A.D.).  Native  Japanese  tradi- 
tions reached  their  apex  in  the  Heian  period  (794-1 185),  producing 
many  artistic  devices  still  in  use  in  the  1990s.  During  periods  of 
strong  Chinese  influence,  new  art  forms  were  adapted,  such  as 
Buddhist  works  in  Nara,  ink  painting  in  the  Muromachi  period, 
and  landscape  painting  by  literati  in  the  Tokugawa  era.  When 
Western  painting  theories  were  introduced  in  the  Meiji  period, 
Japan  already  had  a  long  history  of  adaptation  of  imported  ideas 
and  had  established  a  copy  process  ranging  from  emulation  to  syn- 
thesis. But  it  was  not  until  well  into  the  twentieth  century  that  the 
Japanese  were  able  to  assimilate  the  new  medium  of  oil  paints  with 
new  ideas  of  three-dimensional  projections  on  flat  surfaces. 

Most  contemporary  Japanese  artists  could  be  divided  into  those 
who  worked  in  a  broadly  international  style  and  those  who  main- 
tained Japanese  artistic  traditions,  though  usually  within  a  modern 
idiom.  After  World  War  II,  painters,  calligraphers,  and  printmakers 
flourished  in  the  big  cities,  particularly  Tokyo,  and  became  pre- 
occupied with  the  mechanisms  of  urban  life,  reflected  in  the  flick- 
ering lights,  neon  colors,  and  frenetic  pace  of  their  abstractions.  All

Education  and  the  Arts 


the  "isms"  of  the  New  York-Paris  art  world  were  fervently  em- 
braced. After  the  abstractions  of  the  1960s,  the  1970s  saw  a  return 
to  realism  strongly  flavored  by  the  "op"  and  "pop"  art  move- 
ments, embodied  in  the  1980s  in  the  explosive  works  of  Shinohara 
Ushio.  Many  such  outstanding  avant-garde  artists  worked  both  in 
Japan  and  abroad,  winning  international  prizes.  These  artists  felt 
that  there  was  "nothing  Japanese"  about  their  works,  and  indeed 
they  belonged  to  the  international  school.  By  the  late  1970s,  the 
search  for  Japanese  qualities  and  a  national  style  caused  many  art- 
ists to  reevaluate  their  artistic  ideology  and  turn  away  from  what 
some  felt  were  the  empty  formulas  of  the  West.  Contemporary 
paintings  within  the  modern  idiom  began  to  make  conscious 
use  of  traditional  Japanese  art  forms,  devices,  and  ideologies.  A 
number  of  mono-ha  artists  turned  to  painting  to  recapture  tradi- 
tional nuances  in  spatial  arrangements,  color  harmonies,  and 
lyricism. 

Japanese-style  painting  (nihongd)  had  continued  in  a  modern 
fashion,  updating  traditional  expressions  while  retaining  their  in- 
trinsic character.  Some  artists  within  this  style  still  painted  on  silk 
or  paper  with  traditional  colors  and  ink,  while  others  used  new 
materials,  such  as  acrylics.  Many  of  the  older  schools  of  art,  most 
notably  those  of  the  Tokugawa  period,  were  still  practiced.  For  ex- 
ample, the  decorative  naturalism  of  the  rimpa  school,  character- 
ized by  brilliant,  pure  colors  and  bleeding  washes,  was  reflected 
in  the  work  of  many  postwar  artists  and  in  the  1980s  art  of  Hikosaka 
Naoyoshi.  The  realism  of  the  Maruyama-Okyo  school  and  the  calli- 
graphic and  spontaneous  Japanese  style  of  the  gentlemen- scholars 
were  both  widely  practiced  in  the  1980s.  Sometimes  all  of  these 
schools,  as  well  as  older  ones,  such  as  the  Kano  ink  traditions,  were 
drawn  on  by  contemporary  artists  in  the  Japanese  style  and  in  the 
modern  idiom.  Many  Japanese-style  painters  were  honored  with 
awards  and  prizes,  as  the  late  1970s  and  the  1980s  saw  a  renewed 
popular  demand  for  Japanese-style  art.  More  and  more,  the  in- 
ternational modern  painters  also  drew  on  the  Japanese  schools  as 
they  turned  away  from  Western  styles  in  the  1980s.  The  tendency 
had  been  to  synthesize  East  and  West.  But  new  artistic  approaches 
were  less  in  favor  of  a  conscious  blending  than  of  recapturing  the 
Japanese  spirit  within  a  modern  idiom.  Thus,  the  100-year  split 
between  Japanese-style  and  Western-style  art  began  to  heal.  Some 
artists  had  already  leapt  the  gap  between  the  two,  as  did  the  out- 
standing painter,  Shinoda  Toko.  Her  bold  sumi  ink  abstractions 
were  inspired  by  traditional  calligraphy  but  realized  as  lyrical  ex- 
pressions of  modern  abstraction.

Calligraphy 

Calligraphy,  the  art  of  beautiful  writing,  had  long  been  highly 
esteemed,  intensively  studied,  and  avidly  collected.  The  writing 
of  Chinese  ideograms  (kanji)  in  a  wide  variety  of  styles  was  inherited 
from  the  Chinese  scholarly  tradition,  which  at  one  extreme  became 
the  nearly  indecipherable  grass-style  writing  and  at  the  other  geo- 
metric abstractions.  There  are  famous  exponents  of  all  these  styles 
in  contemporary  Japan  who  have  spent  lifetimes  perfecting  their 
skills.  The  most  widely  used  mode  is  called  kana,  referring  to  the 
Japanese  syllabary,  which  provides  an  opportunity  to  depict  both 
ideograms  and  Japanese  phonetic  sounds  in  set  phrases.  There  are 
many  ways  in  which  this  kind  of  writing  may  be  done:  with  fine, 
delicate  strokes  or  bold,  splashy  ones,  carefully  controlled  or  in  unin- 
hibited freedom,  and  on  a  scale  ranging  from  large  to  minuscule. 
Traditional  Japanese  poetry  is  usually  classified  in  the  kana  group, 
while  modern  poetry  is  placed  in  a  group  by  itself.  Zen  Buddhism 
promoted  a  spontaneous  style  of  writing  in  its  koan,  which  includes 
some  pictorial  additions. 

Because  calligraphy  lends  itself  so  well  to  modern  abstract  paint- 
ing, some  artists  have  used  it  in  this  form;  the  Bokusho  abstract 
school  has  developed  some  outstanding  masters.  Calligraphers  are 
greatly  revered  not  only  for  their  skill  and  scholarship  but  also  for 
their  attainment  of  a  high  spiritual  level,  which  produces  the  medita- 
tive calm  considered  necessary  for  truly  creative  brushwork.  Calli- 
graphy is  widely  collected  at  enormous  prices.  Even  those  who 
cannot  read  the  script,  which  is  not  uncommon  because  some  is 
nearly  abstract,  treasure  writing  by  well-known  persons  in  vari- 
ous fields,  such  as  politics  or  the  military. 

Prints 

Outstanding  among  the  contemporary  arts  for  vitality  and  origi- 
nality are  the  works  of  the  creative  printmakers,  which  have  brought 
worldwide  recognition.  The  twentieth-century  Japanese  print 
evolved  from  the  Western  idea  of  a  single  artist's  conceiving,  ex- 
ecuting, and  producing  one  individual  work.  In  contrast,  the  clas- 
sic ukiyo-e  (floating  world  art)  print  approach  was  of  a  team 
production  by  an  artist  designer,  craftsman  carver,  colorist,  printer, 
and  publisher,  who  promoted  sales  of  multiple  copies.  The  modern 
print  movement  so  stressed  the  creative  process  that  even  in  the 
1980s,  editions  of  prints  were  seldom  very  large  and  were  apt  to 
differ  in  color  or  even  design  elements  from  one  printing  to  the  next. 

In  the  late  twentieth  century,  a  broad  spectrum  of  artistic  styles 
from  traditional  to  experimental  was  practiced  in  a  multiplicity  of 
media  and  techniques.  Munakata  Shiko,  a  major  force  in  gaining

recognition  for  creative  printmaking,  drew  deeply  on  Japanese 
artistic  sources,  from  folk  art  to  Zen  poetry-paintings,  combining 
kanji  with  free-floating  Chagall-like  figures.  He  influenced  many 
other  celebrated  print  artists  who  drew  on  folk  art  and  used  natu- 
ral earth  and  mineral  colors  to  depict  traditional  village  scenes  and 
lively  local  festivals.  Artists  such  as  Sekino  Jun'ichiro  and  Saito 
Kiyoshi  were  inspired  to  update  famous  views,  as  of  the  Tokaido, 
while  others  played  with  traditional  themes  derived  from  sumo, 
the  theater,  or  geisha.  At  the  opposite  pole  are  the  works  of  the 
abstractionists,  the  exponents  of  all  the  "isms"  of  the  day,  and 
the  experimental  essays  of  some  consummate  designers.  Most  avant- 
garde  artists  worked  in  mixed  media,  often  using  engraving  tech- 
niques with  silk-screened  colors  or  monochromatic  metal  prints  with 
soldered  wires.  They  experimented  freely  with  photomontage, 
photo-prints  made  with  an  electric  scanner,  and  lithographs.  Pho- 
tography as  an  art  form  came  into  its  own  in  the  1980s,  and  major 
international  exhibitions  displayed  the  stunning  products  of  artist 
photographers  such  as  Namikawa  Banri,  Kurigama  Kazumi,  and 
Hashi.  In  the  1980s,  a  trend  among  many  young  printmakers  was 
towards  the  use  of  black  and  white  for  somber,  often  superrealis- 
tic,  themes,  captured  with  exquisite  technical  and  artistic  precision. 

Ceramics 

One  of  Japan's  oldest  art  forms,  ceramics,  reaches  back  to  the 
Neolithic  period  (ca.  10,000  B.C.),  when  the  earliest  soft  earthen- 
ware was  coil-made,  decorated  by  hand-impressed  rope  patterns 
(Jomon  ware),  and  baked  in  the  open.  Continental  emigrants  of 
the  third  century  B.C.  introduced  the  use  of  the  wheel  along  with 
the  metal  age  (Yayoi)  and,  eventually  (in  the  third  to  fourth  cen- 
turies A.D.),  a  tunnel  kiln  in  which  stoneware  fired  at  high  tem- 
peratures embellished  with  natural  ash  glaze  was  produced. 
Medieval  kilns  enabled  more  refined  production  of  stoneware,  which 
was  still  produced  in  the  late  twentieth  century  at  a  few  famous 
sites,  especially  in  central  Honshu  around  the  city  of  Seto,  the  wares 
of  which  were  so  widely  used  that  Seto-mono  became  the  generic 
term  for  ceramics  in  Japan.  The  overlord  Toyotomi  Hideyoshi's 
Korean  campaigns  of  the  late  sixteenth  century  were  dubbed  the 
"ceramic  wars,"  since  the  importation  of  Korean  potters  appeared 
to  be  their  major  contribution.  These  potters  introduced  a  variety 
of  new  techniques  and  styles  in  their  artifacts  that  were  greatly  ad- 
mired for  the  tea  ceremony.  They  also  discovered  in  northern 
Kyushu  the  proper  ingredients  needed  to  produce  porcelain  and 
were  soon  dazzling  the  guests  at  daimyo  banquets  with  the  first 
Japanese-made  porcelain  (see  Ashikaga  Bakufu,  ch.  1). 


176 


Education  and  the  Arts 


The  modern  masters  of  these  famous  traditional  kilns  still  bring 
the  ancient  formulas  in  pottery  and  porcelain  to  new  heights  of 
achievement  at  Shiga,  Ige,  Karatsu,  Hagi,  and  Bizen.  Yamamoto 
Masao  of  Bizen  and  Miwa  Kyusetsu  of  Hagi  were  designated  as 
mukei  bunkazai.  By  1989  only  a  half-dozen  potters  were  so  honored, 
either  as  representatives  of  famous  kiln  wares  or  for  the  creation 
of  superlative  techniques  in  glazing  or  decoration,  while  two  groups 
were  designated  for  preserving  the  wares  of  distinguished  ancient 
kilns. 

In  the  old  capital  of  Kyoto,  the  Raku  family  continued  to  pro- 
duce the  famous  rough  tea  bowls  that  had  so  delighted  Hideyoshi, 
while  experiments  continued  to  reconstruct  the  classic  formulas  of 
Momoyama-era  Seto-type  tea  wares  at  Mino,  such  as  the  famous 
Oribe  copper- green  glaze  and  Shino  ware's  prized  milky  glaze. 
Artist  potters  experimented  endlessly  at  the  Kyoto  and  Tokyo  arts 
universities  to  recreate  traditional  porcelain  and  its  decorations 
under  such  outstanding  ceramic  teachers  as  Fujimoto  Yoshimichi, 
a  mukei  bunkazai.  Ancient  porcelain  kilns  around  Arita  in  Kyushu 
were  still  maintained  by  the  lineage  of  the  famous  Sakaida  Kakie- 
mon  and  Imaizume  Imaiemon,  hereditary  porcelain  makers  to  the 
Nabeshima  clan;  both  were  heads  of  groups  designated  mukei 
bunkazai. 

By  the  end  of  the  1980s,  many  master  potters  no  longer  worked 
at  major  or  ancient  kilns,  but  were  making  classic  wares  in  vari- 
ous parts  of  Japan  or  in  Tokyo,  a  notable  example  being  Tsuji 
Seimei,  who  brought  his  clay  from  Shiga  but  potted  in  the  Tokyo 
area.  A  number  of  artists  were  engaged  in  reconstructing  famous 
Chinese  styles  of  decoration  or  glazes,  especially  the  blue-green 
celadon  and  the  watery- green  qingbai.  One  of  the  most  beloved 
Chinese  glazes  in  Japan  is  the  chocolate-brown  tenmoku  glaze  that 
covered  the  peasant  tea  bowls  brought  back  from  Southern  Song 
China  (in  the  twelfth  and  thirteenth  centuries)  by  Zen  monks.  For 
their  Japanese  users,  these  chocolate-brown  wares  embodied  the 
Zen  aesthetic  of  wabi  (rustic  simplicity). 

Interest  in  the  humble  art  of  the  village  potter  was  revived  in 
a  folk  movement  of  the  1920s  by  such  master  potters  as  Hamada 
Shqji  and  Kawai  Kanjiro.  These  artists  studied  traditional  glaz- 
ing techniques  to  preserve  native  wares  in  danger  of  disappear- 
ing. The  kilns  at  Tamba,  overlooking  Kobe,  continued  to  produce 
the  daily  wares  used  in  the  Tokugawa  period,  while  adding  modern 
shapes.  Most  of  the  village  wares  were  made  anonymously  by  local 
potters  for  utilitarian  purposes.  Local  styles,  whether  native  or  im- 
ported, tended  to  be  continued  without  alteration  into  the  present. 
In  Kyushu,  kilns  set  up  by  Korean  potters  in  the  sixteenth  century, 


177 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


such  as  at  Koishibara  and  its  offshoot  at  Onta,  perpetuated 
sixteenth-century  Korean  peasant  wares.  In  Okinawa,  the  produc- 
tion of  village  ware  continued  under  several  leading  masters,  with 
Kaneshiro  Jiro  honored  as  a  mukei  bunkazai. 

Handicrafts 

The  many  and  varied  traditional  handicrafts  of  Japan  enjoyed 
official  recognition  and  protection  and,  owing  to  the  folk  art  move- 
ment, were  much  in  demand.  Each  craft  demanded  a  set  of  special- 
ized skills.  Textile  crafts,  for  example,  included  silk,  hemp,  and 
cotton,  woven  (after  spinning  and  dyeing)  in  forms  ranging  from 
timeless  folk  designs  to  complex  court  patterns.  Village  crafts  evolv- 
ing from  ancient  folk  traditions  also  continued  in  weaving  and  in- 
digo dyeing  in  Hokkaido  by  the  Ainu  peoples,  whose  distinctive 
designs  had  prehistoric  prototypes  and  by  other  remote  farming 
families  in  northern  Japan.  Silk- weaving  families  can  be  traced  to 
the  fifteenth  century  in  the  famous  Nishijin  weaving  center  of 
Kyoto,  where  elegant  fabrics  worn  by  the  emperor  and  the  aristoc- 
racy were  produced.  In  the  seventeenth  century,  designs  on  tex- 
tiles were  applied  using  stencils  and  rice  paste,  in  the  yuzen  or 
paste-resist  method  of  dyeing.  The  yuzen  method  provided  an  imi- 
tation of  aristocratic  brocades,  which  were  forbidden  to  commoners 
by  sumptuary  laws.  Moriguchi  Kako  of  Kyoto  has  continued  to 
create  works  of  art  in  his yuzen-dyed  kimonos,  which  were  so  sought 
after  that  the  contemporary  fashion  industry  designed  an  indus- 
trial method  to  copy  them  for  use  on  Western- style  clothing.  Fa- 
mous designers,  such  as  Hanae  Mori,  borrowed  extensively  from 
kimono  patterns  for  their  couturier  collections.  By  the  late  1980s, 
an  elegant,  handwoven,  dyed  kimono  had  become  extremely  costiy, 
running  to  US$25,000  for  a  formal  garment.  In  Okinawa,  the  fa- 
mous  yuzen-dyeing  method  was  especially  effective  where  it  was 
produced  in  the  bingata  stencil-dyeing  techniques,  which  produced 
exquisitely  colored,  striking  designs  as  artistic  national  treasures. 

Lacquer,  the  first  plastic,  was  invented  in  Asia,  and  its  use  in 
Japan  can  be  traced  to  prehistoric  finds.  Lacquer  ware  is  most  often 
made  from  wooden  objects,  which  receive  multiple  layers  of  re- 
fined lac  juices,  each  of  which  must  dry  before  the  next  is  applied. 
These  layers  make  a  tough  skin  impervious  to  water  damage  and 
breakage-resistant,  providing  lightweight,  easy  to  clean  utensils 
of  every  sort.  The  decoration  on  such  lacquers,  whether  carved 
through  different  colored  layers  or  in  surface  designs,  applied  with 
gold  or  inlaid  with  precious  substances,  has  been  a  prized  art  form 
since  the  Nara  period  (A.D.  710-94). 

Papermaking  is  another  contribution  of  Asian  civilization;  the 
Japanese  art  of  making  paper  from  the  mulberry  plant  is  thought

to  have  begun  in  the  sixth  century.  Dyeing  paper  with  a  wide 
variety  of  hues  and  decorating  it  with  designs  became  a  major 
preoccupation  of  the  Heian  court,  and  the  enjoyment  of  beauti- 
ful paper  and  its  use  has  continued  thereafter,  with  some  modern 
adaptations.  The  traditionally  made  paper  called  Izumo  (after  the 
shrine  area  where  it  is  made)  was  especially  desired  for  fusuma 
(sliding  panels)  decoration,  artists'  papers,  and  elegant  letter  paper. 
Some  printmakers  have  their  own  logo  made  into  their  papers, 
and  since  the  Meiji  period,  another  special  application  has  been 
Western  marbleized  end  papers  (made  by  the  Atelier  Miura  in 
Tokyo). 

Metalwork  is  epitomized  in  the  production  of  the  Japanese  sword, 
of  extremely  high  quality.  These  swords  originated  before  the  first 
century  B.C.  and  reached  their  height  of  popularity  as  the  chief 
possession  of  warlords  and  samurai.  The  production  of  a  sword 
has  retained  something  of  the  religious  quality  it  once  had  in  em- 
bodying the  soul  of  the  samurai  and  the  martial  spirit  of  Japan. 
For  many  Japanese,  the  sword,  one  of  the  "three  jewels"  of  the 
nation,  remained  a  potent  symbol;  possessors  would  treasure  a 
sword  and  it  would  be  maintained  within  the  family,  its  loss  sig- 
nifying their  ruin  (see  Ancient  Cultures,  ch.  1).

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Performing  Arts 

A  remarkable  number  of  the  traditional  forms  of  music,  dance, 
and  theater  have  survived  in  the  contemporary  world,  enjoying 
some  popularity  through  reidentification  with  Japanese  cultural 
values.  Traditional  music  and  dance,  which  trace  their  origins  to 
ancient  religious  use — Buddhist,  Shinto,  and  folk — have  been  pre- 
served in  the  dramatic  performances  of  No,  Kabuki,  and  bunraku 
theater.  Ancient  court  music  and  dance  forms  deriving  from  con- 
tinental sources  were  preserved  through  imperial  household  musi- 
cians and  temple  and  shrine  troupes.  Some  of  the  oldest  musical 
instruments  in  the  world  have  been  in  continuous  use  in  Japan  from 
the  Jomon  period,  as  shown  by  finds  of  stone  and  clay  flutes  and 
zithers  with  between  two  and  four  strings,  to  which  Yayoi-period 
metal  bells  and  gongs  were  added  to  create  early  musical  ensem- 
bles. By  the  early  historical  period  (sixth  to  seventh  centuries  A.D.), 
there  were  a  variety  of  large  and  small  drums,  gongs,  chimes,  flutes, 
and  stringed  instruments,  such  as  the  imported  mandolin-like  biwa, 
and  the  flat  six- stringed  zither,  which  evolved  into  the  thirteen- 
stringed  koto.  These  instruments  formed  the  orchestras  for  the 
seventh-century  continentally  derived  ceremonial  court  music, 
which,  together  with  the  accompanying  bugaku  (a  type  of  court 
dance),  are  the  most  ancient  of  such  forms  still  performed  at  the 
imperial  court,  ancient  temples,  and  shrines.  Buddhism  introduced 
the  rhythmic  chants,  still  used  in  the  1990s,  that  were  joined  with 
native  ideas  and  underlay  the  development  of  vocal  music,  such 
as  in  No. 

The  oldest  dramatic  form  preserved  in  Japan  is  No  theater,  which 
attained  its  contemporary  form  at  the  fourteenth-century  Ashikaga 
court.  In  the  1980s,  there  were  five  major  No  groups  and  a  few 
notable  regional  troupes  performing  several  hundred  plays  from 
a  medieval  repertoire  for  a  popular  audience,  not  just  for  an  elite. 
A  No  play  unfolds  around  the  recitation  and  dancing  of  a  prin- 
cipal and  secondary  figure,  while  a  seated  chorus  chants  a  story, 
accentuated  by  solemn  drum  and  flute  music.  The  dramatic  ac- 
tion is  mimed  in  highly  stylized  gestures  symbolizing  intense  emo- 
tions, which  are  also  evoked  by  terse  lyrical  prose  and  dance. 
Standardized  masks  and  brilliant  costumes  stand  out  starkly  against 
the  austere,  empty  stage  with  its  symbolic  pine  tree  backdrop.  The 
stories  depict  legendary  or  historical  events  of  a  tragic  cast,  infused 
with  Buddhist  ideas.  The  foreboding  atmosphere  is  relieved  by 
comic  interludes  (kyogen)  played  during  the  intermission.  A  few  ex- 
perimental plays  have  been  developed  by  authors  such  as  Mishima 
Yukio  (1925-70),  and  in  the  1980s  a  Christian  No  play  was  written

by  a  Sophia  University  philosophy  professor  and  daringly  performed 
at  the  Vatican  for  Pope  John  Paul  II .  The  National  No  Theater 
has  revived  popular  interest  in  this  ancient  art  form  by  supporting 
experimental  No  plays  in  the  late  1980s. 

Kabuki  and  bunraku  theater  developed  as  popular  forms  of  en- 
tertainment in  the  seventeenth  century.  Kabuki  combined  contem- 
porary music,  acrobatics,  and  mimicry  like  that  of  No,  and  was 
originally  performed  by  troupes  that  included  actresses.  Women 
were  soon  barred  from  appearing,  so  the  often  large  casts  consisted 
entirely  of  male  performers.  Classical  Kabuki  somewhat  resem- 
bles Western  drama,  except  that  dialogue  is  supplemented  by  chant- 
ing and  accompanied  by  music  provided  by  the  samisen,  a  three- 
stringed  lute  perfected  during  the  seventeenth  century.  The  plot 
was  often  clarified  by  the  use  of  a  storyteller  who  recounted  the 
major  action,  as  was  also  customary  in  No. 

Kabuki  conventions  include  the  use  of  artificially  high-pitched 
voices,  exaggerated  gestures  and  miming,  and  flamboyant  costumes 
and  makeup,  but  no  masks.  Elaborate  stage  devices — trapdoors, 
revolving  stages,  and  runways  through  the  theater — heighten  the 
excitement.  Historical  and  legendary  themes  were  extended  to  in- 
clude events  from  the  urban  life  of  the  seventeenth  and  eighteenth 
centuries,  such  as  a  townsman's  dislike  for  the  samurai.  A  com- 
mon theme  in  the  late  seventeenth-century  and  early  eighteenth- 
century  works  of  Chikamatsu  Monzaemon,  "the  Shakespeare  of 
Japan,"  is  the  conflict  between  personal  desires  and  the  Confu- 
cian sense  of  loyalty  and  duty.  By  the  early  1990s,  there  were  two 
national  Kabuki  theaters  in  Tokyo,  as  the  major  performance 
centers  for  this  classical  art,  featuring  a  growing  repertoire  of 
lesser  known  as  well  as  classic  work.  Among  contemporary  masters 
working  to  "update"  Kabuki  and  attract  modern  audiences  were 
Ichikawa  Ennosuke  III,  whose  deft  acting,  clever  acrobatics,  and 
swift  costume  changes  evoked  nearly  magical  illusions,  and 
Tamasaburo  Bando,  the  top  player  of  a  wide  range  of  feminine 
roles.  These  and  other  superb  Kabuki  actors  brought  record  au- 
diences to  performances  in  the  late_1980s. 

Bunraku,  puppet  theater  native  to  Osaka,  was  regarded  as  a  seri- 
ous dramatic  medium  for  adults  (unlike  puppetry  in  many  West- 
ern countries),  and  has  flourished  along  with  Kabuki  since  the 
Tokugawa  period.  Chikamatsu  turned  to  writing  for  the  bunraku 
when  he  became  dissatisfied  with  the  liberties  some  Kabuki  actors 
took  with  his  plays.  A  narrator,  who  sings  all  the  parts,  and  a 
samisen-play'mg  chorus  are  the  main  elements  of  bunraku.  The 
narrator- singer  conveys  the  emotional  content  of  the  play  and  gener- 
ates the  illusion  of  life  into  the  large  puppets,  who  move  realistically

in  complex  roles,  manipulated  by  a  master  and  black-hooded,  robed 
assistants.  These  narrator- singers  derive  from  the  ancient  tradi- 
tion of  storytellers,  whose  exponents  continue  to  flourish  in  modern 
forms,  now  including  women  and  such  uproarish  comics  as  Katsura 
Shijaku. 

Traditional  music,  song,  and  dance  have  been  performed  by 
women,  notably  the  geisha  of  Tokyo  and  Kyoto.  Theatrical  per- 
formances by  Kyoto  geisha  can  be  seen  in  the  spring  and  autumn 
Miyako  Odori  dance  performances.  A  nagauta  (lyric  music)  sing- 
ing group  has  a  full  orchestral  ensemble,  consisting  of  drums,  flutes, 
samisen,  and  koto.  The  traditional  musical  notation  is  based  on  a 
five-tone  scale,  with  semitones  often  ending  on  a  rising  note.  Fa- 
mous performers  may  play  the  samisen  or  koto  only,  or  play  together 
with  a  singer  or  dancer.  The  dances  come  from  No,  Kabuki,  and 
folk  sources,  featuring  large  ensemble  dances  as  highlights  of  these 
brilliant  spectacles. 

Folk  music  and  dance  deriving  from  regional  festivals  and 
ceremonies  began  to  become  well-known  in  Japan  through  radio, 
television,  and  recordings.  Folk  festivals,  concerts,  and  contests, 
and  taverns  specializing  in  folk  singing  contributed  to  the  rising 
popularity  of  these  ancient  forms,  revitalized  by  the  growing  desire 
of  the  young  in  the  1980s  to  learn  traditional  agrarian  songs  and 
dances,  while  the  Japan  Folkloric  Dance  Ensemble  performed  them 
internationally.  Some  thirty  outstanding  performers  from  all  the 
traditional  performing  arts  were  designated  as  mukei  bunkazai  at  the 
end  of  the  1980s. 

Classical  Western  music  has  become  a  fundamental  part  of 
Japanese  musical  education  since  its  introduction  in  the  nineteenth 
century.  The  Toho  School  of  Music  in  Tokyo  has  produced  many 
outstanding  international  performers  on  the  piano  and  stringed  in- 
struments. Children  commonly  studied  piano  or  violin,  and  the 
famous  Suzuki  violin  method  of  training  children  from  the  age  of 
two  had  produced  a  generation  of  virtuosos,  some,  such  as  Midori, 
enjoyed  an  international  reputation. 

Symphony  orchestras  played  in  Tokyo  and  most  major  cities, 
also  making  international  tours.  Japanese  musicians  and  conduc- 
tors gained  international  recognition,  some  performing  regularly 
with  top  foreign  orchestras  overseas  and  on  tour  in  Japan.  Con- 
temporary Japanese  composers  have  experimented  widely  with  in- 
struments: using  Japanese  and  Western  instruments  together,  using 
only  Asian  instruments,  and  capturing  traditional  sounds  with  elec- 
tronic synthesizers  and  Western  instruments.  The  Ensemble 
Nipponica,  Music  Today,  and  Sound  Space  Ark  were  among  the 
major  groups  promoting  modern  Japanese  music.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Classical  Western  opera  enjoyed  a  boom,  with  many  foreign  com- 
panies performing,  and  even  local  companies  rose  to  new  heights 
with  the  development  of  leading  operatic  singers.  Further  evidence 
of  interest  in  Japanese  themes  was  shown  by  a  major  competition 
to  write  a  new  opera  about  Chikamatsu,  with  music  composed  by 
Hara  Kazuko,  a  Doshisha  University  professor. 

Popular  music  was  enjoyed  in  many  forms.  Musical  comedies 
and  revues  were  standard  urban  entertainment.  Broadway  and  Lon- 
don hits  were  quickly  adapted  by  Tokyo  theater  troupes,  often  using 
foreign  directors  for  notable  productions  and  sometimes  featuring 
Western  actors  who  spoke  their  lines  in  Japanese.  Japanese  youth 
everywhere  enjoyed  popular  music:  highly  international  jazz,  rock, 
heavy  metal,  folk,  new  music,  pop,  synthesized  music,  instrumental 
music,  and  Japanese  folk  songs.  Springing  from  popular  music  were 
the  works  of  experimental  composers  like  Hosono  Haruomi  and 
Sakamoto  Ryuichi,  who  blended  Middle  Eastern  or  Chinese  sounds 
for  the  huge  recording  industry  and  film  sound  tracks.  In  1988 
Sakamoto  was  Japan's  first  Oscar-winning  musician  for  his  score 
for  The  Last  Emperor. 

Live  jazz  in  concert  halls,  open  air,  and  hundreds  of  disco  coffee 
shops  and  pianobars  was  enthusiastically  embraced.  While  Ameri- 
can jazz  greats  were  acclaimed,  veteran  Japanese  instrumentalists 
Watanabe  Sadao  and  Hino  Teramasu  also  commanded  major  au- 
diences at  jazz  festivals.  Kitaro  was  the  leading  composer  in  syn- 
thesized sounds,  providing  sometimes  exotic,  but  generally  soothing, 
music  dear  to  the  frazzled  urbanite.  While  percussionist  Tsuchitori 
Toshi  recreated  the  Mahabharata  and  other  ethnic  works,  an  in- 
digenous kind  of  jazz  poured  from  the  Sado  Island  Kodo  drum- 
mers, whose  prodigious  athletic  performances  mesmerized  all  and 
made  their  home  a  new  music  festival  center.  Singing  and  danc- 
ing at  amateur  open  nights  {karaoke)  at  a  growing  number  of  pubs 
was  an  activity  in  which  everyone  could  shine  by  singing  along  with 
prerecorded  tapes.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  hawaiko-chan,  the  new  girl 
singers,  also  were  popular.  Records,  tapes,  and  compact  discs  spread 
every  type  of  music  nationwide  and  provided  common  experience 
for  music  appreciation. 

Twentieth-century  Japanese  dance  draws  on  various  traditional 
styles  and  Western  classical  and  avant-garde  forms,  all  interpretated 
with  the  high  standards  of  Japanese  schools.  Many  famous  dance 
studios  grew  from  training  centers  for  Kabuki  actor-dancers  or 
derived  from  famous  Kabuki  families.  Women  dancers  drawing 
their  art  from  butoh  (classical  Japanese  dance)  were  trained  by  the 
Hanayagi  school,  whose  top  dancers  performed  internationally.

in  Heian  court  costumes,  characterized  by  the  slow,  formal,  and 
elegant  motions  of  this  classical  age  of  Japanese  culture. 

Western  schools  covered  classical  ballet,  jazz-dance,  and  modern 
dance,  and  influenced  the  butoh  avant-garde  dance  movement.  Ballet 
was  said  to  have  replaced  traditional  Japanese  arts,  such  as  flower 
arrangement  and  the  tea  ceremony  in  the  hearts  of  young  girls. 
Prima  ballerina  Morishita  Yoko  sat  on  the  jury  for  the  Prix  de 
Lausanne  Ballet  Competition  in  1989,  held  for  the  first  time  in 
Tokyo,  and  marking  the  arrival  of  Japanese  classical  ballet  in  the 
international  community.  Horiuchi  Gen,  a  1980  Prix  de  Lausanne 
winner,  became  a  major  soloist  with  the  New  York  City  Ballet, 
and  Japanese  performers  noted  for  their  superb  technique  were 
members  of  many  major  international  companies.  Modern  dance 
was  performed  early  after  the  war  and  was  later  taught  by  such 
famous  dancers  as  Eguchi  Takaya.  The  Tokyo  Modern  Dance 
School  and  the  Ozawa  Hisako  Modern  Dance  Company  also 
promoted  avant-garde  modern  dance.  A  wide  experimental  range 
within  modern  dance  occurred  from  which  choreographer 
Teshigawara  Saburo  skillfully  drew  to  create  multifaceted  works 
for  his  KARAS  Company. 

The  vital  avant-garde  butoh  dance  was  a  major  development  after 
the  war:  at  least  five  major  schools  performed  in  the  1985  Butoh 
Festival,  and  there  were  numerous  creative  offshoots.  Hijikata 
Tatsumi  was  a  charismatic  dancer  who  experimented  with  different

kinds  of  creative  dance  to  capture  expressive  motions  he  considered 
expressly  suited  to  the  Japanese  physiognomy  and  psyche.  He  com- 
bined eroticism,  social  criticism,  and  avant-garde  theater  ideas,  and 
considered  the  body  to  be  a  repository  for  "stored  memories," 
which  could  be  metamorphosed  into  dance  forms.  His  theories  and 
choreography  were  carried  on  by  a  number  of  famous  dancers,  who 
eventually  formed  their  own  major  companies,  which  were  strong 
in  the  1980s  and  made  tours  abroad. 

Modern  drama  in  the  late  twentieth  century  consisted  of  shingeki 
(experimental  Western- style  theater),  which  employed  natural- 
istic acting  and  contemporary  themes  in  contrast  to  the  stylized 
conventions  of  Kabuki  and  No.  In  the  postwar  period,  there  was 
a  phenomenal  growth  in  creative  new  dramatic  works,  which  in- 
troduced fresh  aesthetic  concepts  that  revolutionized  the  orthodox 
modern  theater.  Challenging  the  realistic,  psychological  drama  fo- 
cused on  "tragic  historical  progress"  of  the  Western-derived  shingeki, 
young  playwrights  broke  with  such  accepted  tenets  as  conventional 
stage  space,  placing  their  action  in  tents,  streets,  and  open  areas, 
and,  at  the  extreme,  in  scenes  played  out  all  over  Tokyo.  Plots  be- 
came increasingly  complex,  with  play-within-a-play  sequences, 
moving  rapidly  back  and  forth  in  time,  and  intermingling  reality 
with  fantasy.  Dramatic  structure  was  fragmented,  with  the  focus 
on  the  performer,  who  often  used  a  variety  of  masks  to  reflect  differ- 
ent personae.  Playwrights  returned  to  common  stage  devices  per- 
fected in  No  and  Kabuki  to  project  their  ideas,  such  as  employing 
a  narrator,  who  could  also  use  English  for  international  audiences. 
Major  playwrights  in  the  1980s  were  Kara  Joro,  Shimizu  Kunio, 
and  Betsuyaku  Minoru,  all  closely  connected  to  specific  compa- 
nies. In  the  1980s,  stagecraft  was  refined  into  a  more  sophisticated, 
complex  format  than  in  the  earlier  postwar  experiments  but  lacked 
their  bold  critical  spirit. 

Many  Western  plays,  from  those  of  the  ancient  Greeks  to  Shake- 
speare and  from  those  of  Fyodor  Dostoevsky  to  Samuel  Beckett, 
were  performed  in  Tokyo.  An  incredible  number  of  performances, 
perhaps  as  many  as  3,000,  were  given  each  year,  making  Tokyo 
one  of  the  world's  leading  theatrical  centers.  The  opening  of  the 
replica  of  the  Globe  Theater  was  celebrated  by  importing  an  en- 
tire British  company  to  perform  all  of  Shakespeare's  historical  plays, 
while  other  Tokyo  theaters  produced  other  Shakespearean  plays 
including  various  new  interpretations  of  Hamlet  and  King  Lear. 

Suzuki  Tadashi's  Togo  troupe  developed  a  unique  kind  of 
"method  acting,"  integrating  avant-garde  concepts  with  classical 
No  and  Kabuki  devices,  an  approach  that  became  a  major  creative

force  in  Japanese  and  international  theater  in  the  1980s.  Another 
highly  original  East-West  fusion  occurred  in  the  inspired  produc- 
tion Nastasya,  taken  from  Dostoevsky's  The  Idiot,  in  which  Bando 
Tamasaburo,  a  famed  Kabuki  onnagata  (female  impersonator), 
played  the  roles  of  both  the  prince  and  his  fiancee. 

Literature 

Japanese  literature  dates  from  about  the  fifth  century  A.D.,  when 
the  Chinese  writing  system  began  to  be  used  by  scribes  at  the 
Yamato  court.  As  soon  as  the  Japanese  courtiers  learned  to  read, 
they  began  to  write,  compiling  between  the  sixth  century  and  the 
eighth  century  both  a  state  history  of  epic  proportions,  the  Kojiki 
(Record  of  Ancient  Matters)  and  one  of  the  world's  oldest  poetry 
anthologies,  the  Man'yoshu  (Collection  of  Ten  Thousand  Leaves), 
both  of  which  contain  many  older  works.  They  also  composed 
Chinese-style  poetry,  which  they  found  suitable  for  more  difficult, 
lengthy,  and  profound  thoughts.  By  the  eighth  century,  the  elite 
had  already  come  to  grips  with  the  problem  of  assimilating  difficult 
foreign  ideas  in  a  complex  new  language.  The  dichotomy  between 
native  expression  and  the  use  of  prestigious  imported  forms  be- 
came a  pattern  of  Japanese  artistic  life.  Buddhist  commentary  ap- 
peared after  several  centuries  of  copying,  translation,  and  study.

In  the  ninth  century  it  found  a  strong  voice  and  skilled  brush  in 
the  monk  Kukai,  through  whose  inspiration  religious  themes  be- 
came a  part  of  the  literary  fabric. 

Prose  works  had  reached  a  high  level  by  the  tenth  century,  when 
the  literary  diary  made  its  appearance,  and  in  the  eleventh  the 
world's  first  novel,  Genji  monogatari  (Tale  of  Genji),  was  composed 
by  a  court  lady,  Murasaki  Shikibu.  Her  acute  psychological  ob- 
servations molded  by  a  subtle  feminine  sensibility  wove  a  deft  pic- 
ture of  the  hothouse  Heian  court  society.  It  remains  a  matchless 
source  for  all  subsequent  writers  and  an  important  part  of  the  clas- 
sical education  of  every  Japanese.  In  the  medieval  period,  wom- 
en's vernacular  writing  dominated  prose  in  the  form  of  diaries  of 
court  ladies,  supplemented  by  recollections  of  courtiers,  the  wry 
comments  and  musings  of  monks,  and  a  wide  variety  of  tales  and 
legends,  both  secular  and  profane.  Heike  monogatari  (Tale  of  the 
Heike)  captured  the  samurai  spirit  of  the  Kamakura  warriors'  age, 
while  the  melancholy  thirty-one  syllable  waka  poems  (in  a  five-seven- 
five- seven-seven  syllables-per-line  arrangement)  of  the  twelfth- 
century  monk  Saigyo  reflected  the  mood  of  a  militant  era.  Exiles 
from  the  capital  and  monastic  authors  who  contemplated  the  fleeting 
vanities  of  this  world,  and  the  theme  of  death  and  the  spirit  world 
characterized  writing  of  the  Muromachi  period,  setting  the  tone 
for  the  No  plays  of  Zeami  Motokiyo  (1363-1443).  Comic  relief  was 
provided  by  kyogen,  using  the  vernacular  to  reveal  something  of 
the  life  of  the  commoner. 

The  peace  and  prosperity  of  the  Tokugawa  age  produced  a  new 
mercantile  class — the  chonin — whose  antics  were  humorously  de- 
scribed in  the  vigorous  seventeenth-century  novels  of  Ihara  Saikaku, 
dispelling  the  lingering  melancholy  of  the  late  feudal  period.  A  major 
poet  of  this  age,  Matsuo  Basho,  lifted  his  voice  to  extol  the  quali- 
ties of  loneliness,  of  getting  away  from  the  new  crowded  towns  by 
taking  the  "narrow  road  to  the  deep  north,"  a  celebrated  journey 
whose  three-hundredth  anniversary  was  widely  commemorated  in 
the  late  1980s.  Basho' s  matchless  renku  (linked  poems)  of  thirty-six 
verses  and  his  lighthearted  seventeen- syllable  haiku  (five- seven-five) 
set  a  norm  for  modern  emulators.  A  third  literary  genius  of  this 
period  was  the  great  dramatist,  Chikamatsu  Monzaemon,  whose 
historical  and  domestic  plays  formed  the  soul  of  the  Kabuki  thea- 
ter. In  the  eighteenth  century,  Chinese  novels  were  translated  into 
Japanese,  the  poet  Yosa  Buson  infused  a  new  romantic  spirit  into 
haiku  poems,  and  Kobayashi  Issa  made  interesting  subjects  out 
of  the  "ordinariness"  of  the  common  folk  and  the  ugly,  starveling 
sparrow.

Japanese  literature  clearly  draws  on  a  tradition  rich  in  poetic 
and  prose  forms.  The  writing  of  poetry  in  both  the  classic  thirty- 
one  syllable  waka  and  the  seventeen- syllable  haiku  remained  a  na- 
tional pastime  and  a  skill  expected  of  the  educated,  among  whom 
competitions  were  frequently  held.  Japanese  renga  parties,  at  which 
poets  and  the  intelligentsia  composed  poetry  in  groups,  continued 
as  a  major  literary  pursuit.  Haiku  poets  were  among  the  most  hon- 
ored of  all  creative  artists,  and  a  haiku  museum  was  established 
in  1976  as  a  public  center  for  poetry  study.  The  ancient  waka  in 
modern  usage  is  called  a  tanka,  or  short  song  (also  with  a  five-seven- 
five-seven-seven  syllabic  formula).  Many  writers  continued  to  use 
this  form  for  less  profound  thoughts.  Even  more  striking  were  the 
modern  permutations  of  older  literary  forms:  such  experiments  as 
two  syllable  haiku,  tanka  in  romaji  (romanized  form  of  kana),  and 
Zen  ideas  expressed  in  Western-style  "free  verse." 

The  introduction  of  European  literature  in  the  late  nineteenth 
century  brought  "free  verse"  into  the  poetic  repertoire;  it  became 
widely  used  for  longer  works  embodying  new  intellectual  themes. 
Young  Japanese  prose  writers  and  dramatists  have  struggled  with 
a  whole  galaxy  of  new  ideas  and  artistic  schools,  but  novelists  were 
the  first  to  successfully  assimilate  some  of  these  concepts.  A  new 


189

colloquial  literature  developed  centering  around  the  "I  novel,"  with 
some  unusual  protagonists  as  in  Natsume  Soseki's  Wagahai  wa  neko 
de  aru  (I  Am  a  Cat).  Two  modern  literary  giants  whose  works  were 
deeply  rooted  in  Japanese  sensibilities  were  Tanizaki  Jun'ichiro, 
who  captured  the  East-West  value  struggle  in  Japanese  life  prior 
to  World  War  II  and  Kawabata  Yasunari,  a  master  of  psychological 
fiction  during  the  mid-century  and  a  Nobel  Prize  winner.  Captur- 
ing the  immediate  postwar  atmosphere  were  Dazai  Osamu  and 
Mishima  Yukio,  both  of  whom  committed  suicide.  Dazai' s  writ- 
ing reflected  the  quiet  desperation  of  living  with  defeat,  while 
Mishima  provided  a  glowing  vision  of  traditional  morality,  gradu- 
ally overcome  by  new  Western  values. 

Prominent  writers  of  the  1970s  and  1980s,  such  as  Oe  Kensaburo, 
were  identified  with  intellectual  and  moral  issues  in  their  attempts 
to  raise  social  and  political  consciousness.  Inoue  Mitsuaki  had  long 
been  concerned  with  the  atomic  bomb  and  continued  in  the  1980s 
to  write  on  problems  of  the  nuclear  age,  while  Endo  Shusaku  de- 
picted the  religious  dilemma  of  Roman  Catholics  in  feudal  Japan, 
as  a  springboard  to  address  spiritual  problems.  Inoue  Yasushi  also 
turned  to  the  past  in  masterful  historical  novels  of  Inner  Asia  and 
ancient  Japan,  in  order  to  portray  present  human  fate. 

Avant-garde  writers,  such  as  Abe  Kobo,  who  wanted  to  express 
the  Japanese  experience  in  modern  terms  without  using  either  in- 
ternational styles  or  traditional  conventions,  developed  new  inner 
visions.  Furui  Yoshikichi  tellingly  related  the  lives  of  alienated  urban 
dwellers  coping  with  the  minutiae  of  daily  life,  while  the  psycho- 
dramas  within  such  daily  life  crises  have  been  explored  by  a  rising 
number  of  important  women  novelists.  The  1988  Naoki  Prize  went 
to  Todo  Shizuko  for  Ripening  Summer,  a  story  capturing  the  com- 
plex psychology  of  modern  women.  Other  award-winning  stories 
at  the  end  of  the  decade  dealt  with  current  issues  of  the  elderly  in 
hospitals,  the  recent  past  {Pure-Hearted  Shopping  District  in  Koenji, 
Tokyo),  and  the  life  of  a  Meiji  ukiyo-e  artist.  In  international  litera- 
ture, Ishiguro  Kazuo,  a  native  of  Japan,  had  taken  up  residence 
in  Britain  and  won  Britain's  prestigious  Booker  Prize. 

Although  modern  Japanese  writers  covered  a  wide  variety  of  sub- 
jects, one  particularly  Japanese  approach  stressed  their  subjects' 
inner  lives,  widening  the  earlier  novel's  preoccupation  with  the  nar- 
rator's consciousness.  In  Japanese  fiction,  plot  development  and 
action  have  often  been  of  secondary  interest  to  emotional  issues. 
In  keeping  with  the  general  trend  toward  reaffirming  national 
characteristics,  many  old  themes  reemerged,  and  some  authors 
turned  consciously  to  the  past.  Strikingly,  Buddhist  attitudes  about 
the  importance  of  knowing  oneself  and  the  poignant  impermanence 


190 


Education  and  the  Arts 


of  things  formed  an  undercurrent  to  sharp  social  criticism  of  this 
material  age.  There  was  a  growing  emphasis  on  women's  roles, 
the  Japanese  persona  in  the  modern  world,  and  the  malaise  of  com- 
mon people  lost  in  the  complexities  of  urban  culture. 

Popular  fiction,  nonfiction  works,  and  children's  literature  all 
flourished  in  urban  Japan  in  the  1980s.  Many  popular  works  fell 
between  "pure  literature"  and  pulp  novels,  including  all  sorts  of 
historical  serials,  information-packed  docudramas,  science  fiction, 
mysteries,  business  stories,  war  journals,  and  animal  stories.  Best- 
sellers in  the  late  1980s  were  several  books  by  a  young  woman, 
"Banana"  Yoshimoto,  and  Murakami  Haruki's  spectacularly  suc- 
cessful Norwegian  Wood  and  A  Wild  Sheep  Chase.  Nonfiction  covered 
everything  from  crime  to  politics.  Although  factual  journalism 
predominated,  many  of  these  works  were  interpretive,  reflecting 
a  high  degree  of  individualism.  Children's  works  reemerged  in  the 
1950s,  and  the  newer  entrants  into  this  field,  many  of  them  younger 
women,  brought  new  vitality  to  it  in  the  1980s.  Manga  (comic  books) 
have  penetrated  almost  every  sector  of  the  popular  market.  Widely 
used  for  soft  pornography,  they  also  have  included  a  multivolume 
high- school  history  of  Japan  and,  for  the  adult  market,  a  manga 
introduction  to  economics,  which  was  also  available  in  English. 
Manga  represented  between  20  and  30  percent  of  annual  publica- 
tions at  the  end  of  the  1980s,  in  sales  of  some  ¥400  billion  per  year. 

Films  and  Television 

Reeling  from  television's  overwhelming  success,  the  cinema  in- 
dustry retreated  in  the  1980s  to  the  tried-and-true  formulas,  the 
comedies,  romances,  detective  stories,  and  youth  films  that  always 
had  sure  audiences.  Production  at  the  four  major  film  companies 
dwindled  to  some  200  films  a  year,  of  which  only  a  handful  were 
quality  productions.  Pornographic  films  grew  to  constitute  about 
half  of  films  made.  The  animated  format  used  for  children's  films 
did  show  promising  originality,  but  truly  creative  productions  could 
be  found  only  among  independent  film  directors.  A  burgeoning 
number  of  art  films,  both  domestic  and  imported,  found  homes 
in  intimate  art  theaters  in  the  cities.  Foreign  films  were  often  the 
major  draws  in  urban  areas,  which  had  record  runs  for  European 
and  North  American  hits.  Some  top  directors  produced  major  films 
with  foreign  funding  or  in  foreign  locations.  In  a  return  to  Japanese 
production  at  the  end  of  the  1980s,  Akira  Kurosawa,  the  ac- 
knowledged old  master  of  cinematic  art,  summarized  his  remem- 
brance of  things  past  in  his  movie  Dreams.  A  nostalgic  look  at  past 
views  of  family  life  was  seen  in  Ichikawa  Kon's  remake  of  Tanizaki 
Jun'ichiro's  The  Makioka  Sisters,  a  visually  beautiful  color  film

portraying  the  nearly  vanished  world  of  early  twentieth- century 
upper-class  women.  A  major  historical  offering  was  Teshigawara 
Hiroshi's  Rikyu  (1989),  which  marked  the  return  of  this  major  direc- 
tor after  a  seventeen-year  absence  from  films,  in  a  pictorially  mag- 
nificent presentation  of  the  life  of  the  famous  Momoyama  tea  master 
and  his  moral  conflict  with  the  political  overlord  Hideyoshi. 

Although  there  was  virtually  no  market  in  Japan  for  documen- 
taries, a  major  docudrama,  Tokyo  saiban  (Tokyo  Judgment),  directed 
by  Kobayashi  Masaki,  and  taken  directly  from  footage  of  tribunal 
proceedings  against  alleged  Japanese  war  criminals,  had  a  rapt  au- 
dience. Outstanding  among  the  newer  independent  directors  were 
Itami  Juzo  and  Morita  Yoshimitsu,  whose  The  Family  Game  set  a 
new  pattern  for  satirical  comedies  on  urban  dilemmas.  By  the 
mid-1980s,  Itami 's  savage  new  satires  showed  unprecedented  origi- 
nality. Although  these  films  addressed  the  anomalies  and  excesses 
of  Japanese  life,  their  subjects  were  mirrored  around  the  world, 
and  they  had  a  strong  international  following. 

Popular  comedy  was  led  by  the  beloved  Tora-san  series  about 
the  travel  adventures  of  an  avuncular,  bumbling  everyman,  played 
by  the  ever-popular  Atsumi  Kiyoshi,  whose  forty-first  feature  film 
in  1989  took  the  hero  to  Vienna  in  a  telling  display  of  internation- 
alization. Another  hoary  favorite  was  the  monster  series  starring 
Godzilla.  The  most  sophisticated  youth  movie  of  the  1980s  may 
have  been  Yamakawa  Naoto's  The  New  Morning  of  Billy  the  Kid, 
a  fantasy  set  in  a  Tokyo  theme-bar,  which  was  embraced  by  the 
young  worldwide.  A  much-loved  children's  classic  Kaze  no  matasaburo 
(Children  of  the  Wind)  written  by  Miyazawa  Kenji,  was  filmed 
by  award- winning  director  Ito  Shunya  as  a  skillful  fantasy.  Ani- 
mated full-length  features  ranged  from  a  gorgeously  interpreted 
selection  from  Tale  of  Genji  to  Otomoto  Katsushiro's  Akira,  a  vio- 
lent, provocative  futuristic  fantasy.  Such  animated  features  had 
their  origins  in  the  wildly  popular  manga  action  cartoons.  Televi- 
sion also  produced  a  substantial  number  of  cartoons,  including  the 
ever  popular  '  'Sazae-san, ' '  which  had  the  highest  rating  in  the  late 
1980s. 

Television  had  attained  virtually  100  percent  penetration  by  1990, 
and  only  1  percent  of  households  were  without  a  color  television 
set,  making  Japan  a  major  information  society.  Programming  con- 
sisted of  about  50  percent  pure  entertainment  and  nearly  25  per- 
cent cultural  shows,  the  remainder  being  news  reports  and 
educational  programs.  There  were  two  main  broadcasting  systems: 
the  public  NHK  and  five  private  networks.  The  major  system, 
NHK,  was  publicly  subsidized  by  mandatory  subscription  fees. 
Leading  newspapers  were  among  the  financial  supporters  of  the 


192 


Education  and  the  Arts 


most  important  private  channels.  International  programs  were 
transmitted  by  satellite  for  instant  replay  after  the  government,  in 
1979,  set  up  the  Communications  and  Broadcasting  Satellite  Or- 
ganization. Japan's  first  operational  broadcast  satellite  was  launched 
in  1984.  Commercial  television  stations  had  become  a  major  vehi- 
cle for  advertising  in  place  of  newspapers  and  received  huge 
revenues,  far  surpassing  those  of  NHK. 

Samurai  and  yakuza  (Japanese  underworld)  themes  were  now 
almost  solely  the  provenance  of  television,  as  were  those  of  family 
life,  ubiquitous  in  daytime  soaps.  The  biggest  hit  of  the  1980s  overall 
was  the  television  drama  "Oshin,"  a  tale  of  a  mother's  struggles 
and  suffering.  The  longest-running  series  since  1981  was  "From 
the  North  Country,"  in  which  a  divorced  father  and  his  two  chil- 
dren survive  in  the  backwoods  of  Hokkaido. 

Criticisms  continued  concerning  the  vulgarity  of  some  commer- 
cial programs,  but  these  programs  still  appeared  in  the  early  1990s. 
Major  problems  perceived  were  the  high  level  of  violence  and  the 
lack  of  moral  values  in  children's  shows.  All  television  and  radio 
stations,  however,  were  required  to  devote  a  certain  proportion  of 
broadcast  time  to  educational  programs  to  retain  their  licenses,  and 
these  programs  grew  steadily  in  response  to  popular  demand.  All 
networks  have  to  comply  with  the  Broadcasting  Law  of  1950,  while 
several  councils  oversee  general  programming,  although  compli- 
ance with  their  recommendations  is  voluntary. 

Japan's  traditional  arts  and  their  modern  counterparts  found  wide 
expression  at  home  and  internationally  in  the  1980s,  reflecting  the 
strong  continuing  creativity  of  its  artists,  performers,  and  writers. 
Major  trends  were  seen  in  the  search  for  characteristic  cultural 
values  and  modes  of  expression,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  grow- 
ing awareness  of  internationalism,  on  the  other,  affirming  Japan's 
strong  economic  position  in  the  world.

Chapter  4.  The  Character  and  Structure 

of  the  Economy 


Family  crest  with  a  flying  phoenix  (ho'o),  the  bird  of  immortality 


THE  JAPANESE  ECONOMY  entered  the  1990s  in  excellent 
shape.  Japan  had  the  world's  second  largest  gross  national  product 
(GNP — see  Glossary)  throughout  the  1970s  and  ranked  first  among 
major  industrial  nations  in  1989  in  per  capita  GNP,  at  US$23,616, 
up  sharply  from  US$8,900  in  1980.  After  a  mild  economic  slump 
in  the  mid-1980s,  Japan's  economy  began  a  period  of  expansion 
in  1986  that  was  continuing  in  1990.  Economic  growth  averaging 
5  percent  between  1987  and  1989  revived  industries,  such  as  steel 
and  construction,  which  had  been  relatively  dormant  in  the  mid- 
1980s,  and  brought  record  salaries  and  employment  (see  table  9, 
Appendix).  Unlike  the  economic  booms  of  the  1960s  and  1970s, 
however,  when  increasing  exports  played  the  key  role  in  economic 
expansion,  domestic  demand  propelled  the  Japanese  economy  in 
the  late  1980s.  This  development  involved  fundamental  economic 
restructuring,  from  export  dependence  to  reliance  on  domestic  de- 
mand. The  boom  that  started  in  1986  was  generated  by  the  deci- 
sions of  companies  to  increase  private  plant  and  equipment  spending 
and  of  consumers  to  go  on  a  buying  spree.  Japan's  imports  grew 
at  a  faster  rate  than  exports. 

During  the  1980s,  the  Japanese  economy  shifted  its  emphasis 
away  from  primary  and  secondary  activities  (notably  agriculture, 
manufacturing,  and  mining)  to  processing,  with  telecommunica- 
tions and  computers  becoming  increasingly  vital.  Information  be- 
came an  important  resource  and  product,  central  to  wealth  and 
power.  The  rise  of  an  information-based  economy  was  led  by  major 
research  in  highly  sophisticated  technology,  such  as  advanced  com- 
puters. The  selling  and  use  of  information  became  very  beneficial 
to  the  economy.  Tokyo  became  a  major  financial  center,  home  of 
some  of  the  world's  major  banks,  financial  firms,  insurance  com- 
panies, and  the  world's  largest  stock  exchange. 

A  national  effort  in  the  1980s  involved  both  government  and  busi- 
ness in  increasing  Japan's  influence  in  the  area  of  high  technol- 
ogy. One  important  development  area  was  industrial  automation. 
Automotive  producers,  such  as  Toyota  and  Nissan,  relied  increas- 
ingly on  robotics  in  their  factories.  Japan  planned  a  much-touted 
Fifth  Generation  artificial  intelligence  computer  project,  boasted 
a  new  but  active  space  program,  and  designated  new  towns  as 
research  centers  and  production  hubs  for  new  technologies.  In  the 
area  of  semiconductors,  by  1989  Japan  was  outproducing  the  United 
States,  which  had  enjoyed  a  nearly  two- to-one  lead  in  world  market 


197 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

share  in  the  mid-1980s.  Japan  became  a  world  leader  in  techno- 
logical research  and  production. 

Japanese  postwar  technological  research  was  carried  out  for  the 
sake  of  economic  growth  rather  than  military  development.  The 
growth  in  high-technology  industries  in  the  1980s  resulted  from 
heightened  domestic  demand  for  high- technology  products  and  for 
higher  living,  housing,  and  environmental  standards,  better  health, 
medical,  and  welfare  opportunities,  better  leisure- time  facilities, 
and  improved  ways  to  accommodate  a  rapidly  aging  society. 

The  development  of  a  postindustrial  economy  did  not  mean  the 
end  of  Japan's  importance  as  a  major  manufacturing  center.  Tradi- 
tional industries,  such  as  iron  and  steel,  automobiles,  and  construc- 
tion, experienced  strong  growth  in  the  late  1980s,  and  there  was 
every  indication  that  these  industries  would  continue  to  grow  in 
the  1990s.  Only  the  primary  sector  (agriculture,  forestry,  and  fish- 
ing) and  mining  showed  signs  of  decline  in  the  1980s. 

Patterns  of  Development 

Revolutionary  Change 

Since  the  mid-nineteenth  century,  when  the  Tokugawa  govern- 
ment first  opened  the  country  to  Western  commerce  and  influence, 
Japan  has  gone  through  two  periods  of  economic  development  (see 
Decline  of  the  Tokugawa;  The  Emergence  of  Modern  Japan, 
1868-1919;  and  World  War  II  and  the  Occupation,  1941-52,  ch.  1). 
The  first  began  in  1854  and  extended  through  World  War  II;  the 
second  began  in  1945  and  continued  into  the  early  1990s.  In  both 
periods,  the  Japanese  opened  themselves  to  Western  ideas  and  in- 
fluence; experienced  revolutionary  social,  political,  and  economic 
changes;  and  became  a  world  power  with  carefully  developed  spheres 
of  influence.  During  both  periods,  the  Japanese  government  en- 
couraged economic  change  by  fostering  a  national  revolution  from 
above,  planning  and  advising  in  every  aspect  of  society.  The  na- 
tional goal  each  time  was  to  make  Japan  so  powerful  and  wealthy 
that  its  independence  would  never  again  be  threatened. 

In  the  Meiji  period  (1868-1912),  leaders  inaugurated  a  new 
Western-based  education  system  for  all  young  people,  sent  thou- 
sands of  students  to  the  United  States  and  Europe,  and  hired  more 
than  3,000  Westerners  to  teach  modern  science,  mathematics,  tech- 
nology, and  foreign  languages  in  Japan  (see  Historical  Background, 
ch.  3).  The  government  also  built  railroads,  improved  roads,  and 
inaugurated  a  land  reform  program  to  prepare  the  country  for  fur- 
ther development. 

To  promote  industrialization,  government  decided  that,  while 
it  should  help  private  business  to  allocate  resources  and  to  plan, 


198 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

the  private  sector  was  best  equipped  to  stimulate  economic  growth. 
The  greatest  role  of  government  was  to  help  provide  the  economic 
conditions  in  which  business  could  flourish.  In  short,  government 
was  to  be  the  guide,  and  business  the  producer.  In  the  early  Meiji 
period,  the  government  built  factories  and  shipyards  that  were  sold 
to  entrepreneurs  at  a  fraction  of  their  value.  Many  of  these  busi- 
nesses grew  rapidly  into  the  larger  conglomerates  that  still  domi- 
nated much  of  the  business  world  in  the  early  1990s.  Government 
emerged  as  chief  promoter  of  private  enterprise,  enacting  a  series 
of  probusiness  policies,  including  low  corporate  taxes. 

Before  World  War  II,  Japan  built  an  extensive  empire  that  in- 
cluded Taiwan,  Korea,  Manchuria,  and  parts  of  northern  China 
(see  Diplomacy,  ch.  1).  The  Japanese  regarded  this  sphere  of  in- 
fluence as  a  political  and  economic  necessity,  preventing  foreign 
states  from  strangling  Japan  by  blocking  its  access  to  raw  mate- 
rials and  crucial  sea-lanes.  Japan's  large  military  force  was  regarded 
as  essential  to  the  empire's  defense.  The  colonies  were  lost  as  a 
result  of  World  War  II,  but  since  then  the  Japanese  have  extended 
their  economic  influence  throughout  Asia  and  beyond.  Japan's  Con- 
stitution, promulgated  in  1947,  forbids  an  offensive  military  force, 
but  Japan  still  maintained  its  formidable  Self-Defense  Forces  and 
ranked  third  in  the  world  in  military  spending  behind  the  United 
States  and  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  late  1980s  (see  The  Postwar 
Constitution,  ch.  6;  Defense  Spending,  ch.  8). 

Rapid  growth  and  structural  change  have  characterized  Japan's 
two  periods  of  economic  development  since  1868.  In  the  first  pe- 
riod, the  economy  grew  only  moderately  at  first  and  relied  heavily 
on  traditional  agriculture  to  finance  modern  industrial  infrastruc- 
ture. By  the  time  the  Russo-Japanese  War  (1904-5)  began,  65  per- 
cent of  employment  and  38  percent  of  gross  domestic  product 
(GDP — see  Glossary)  was  still  based  on  agriculture,  but  modern 
industry  had  begun  to  expand  substantially.  By  the  late  1920s, 
manufacturing  and  mining  contributed  23  percent  of  GDP,  com- 
pared to  21  percent  for  all  of  agriculture.  Transportation  and  com- 
munications had  developed  to  sustain  heavy  industrial  development. 

In  the  1930s,  the  Japanese  economy  suffered  less  from  the  Great 
Depression  than  other  industrialized  nations,  expanding  at  the  rapid 
rate  of  5  percent  of  GDP  per  year,  while  manufacturing  and  min- 
ing came  to  account  for  more  than  30  percent  of  GDP,  more  than 
twice  the  value  for  the  agricultural  sector.  Most  industrial  growth, 
however,  was  geared  toward  expanding  the  nation's  military  power. 

World  War  II  wiped  out  many  of  Japan's  gains  since  1868.  About 
40  percent  of  the  nation's  industrial  plants  and  infrastructure  was 
destroyed,  and  production  reverted  to  levels  of  about  fifteen  years 


199 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

earlier.  The  people  were  shocked  by  the  devastation  and  swung 
into  action.  New  factories  were  equipped  with  the  best  modern 
machines,  giving  Japan  an  initial  competitive  advantage  over  the 
victor  states,  who  now  had  older  factories.  As  Japan's  second  period 
of  economic  development  began,  millions  of  former  soldiers  joined 
a  well-disciplined  and  highly  educated  work  force  to  rebuild  Japan. 

Japan's  highly  acclaimed  postwar  education  system  contributed 
strongly  to  the  modernizing  process.  The  world's  highest  literacy 
rate  and  high  education  standards  were  major  reasons  for  Japan's 
success  in  achieving  a  technologically  advanced  economy.  Japanese 
schools  also  encouraged  discipline,  another  benefit  in  forming  an 
effective  work  force. 

The  early  postwar  years  were  devoted  to  rebuilding  lost  indus- 
trial capacity:  major  investments  were  made  in  electric  power,  coal, 
iron  and  steel,  and  chemical  fertilizers.  By  the  mid-1950s,  produc- 
tion matched  prewar  levels.  Released  from  the  demands  of  military- 
dominated  government,  the  economy  not  only  recovered  its  lost 
momentum,  but  also  surpassed  the  growth  rates  of  earlier  periods. 
Between  1953  and  1965,  GDP  expanded  by  over  9  percent  per  year, 
manufacturing  and  mining  by  13  percent,  construction  by  1 1  per- 
cent, and  infrastructure  by  12  percent.  In  1965  these  sectors  em- 
ployed over  41  percent  of  the  labor  force  while  only  26  percent 
remained  in  agriculture. 

The  mid-1960s  ushered  in  a  new  type  of  industrial  development 
as  the  economy  opened  itself  to  international  competition  in  some 
industries  and  developed  heavy  and  chemical  manufactures. 
Whereas  textiles  and  light  manufactures  maintained  their  profita- 
bility internationally,  other  products,  such  as  automobiles,  ships, 
and  machine  tools,  assumed  new  importance.  Manufacturing  and 
mining  value-added  grew  at  the  rate  of  17  percent  per  year  be- 
tween 1965  and  1970.  Growth  rates  moderated  to  about  8  percent 
and  evened  out  between  the  industrial  and  service  sectors  between 
1970  and  1973,  as  retail  trade,  finance,  real  estate,  information, 
and  other  service  industries  streamlined  their  operations. 

Japan  faced  severe  economic  challenge  in  the  mid-1970s.  The 
world  oil  crisis  in  1973  shocked  an  economy  that  had  become  vir- 
tually dependent  on  foreign  petroleum  (see  The  Value  of  the  Yen, 
ch.  5).  Japan  experienced  its  first  postwar  decline  in  industrial 
production  together  with  severe  price  inflation.  The  recovery  that 
followed  the  first  oil  crisis  revived  the  optimism  of  most  business 
leaders,  but  the  maintenance  of  industrial  growth  in  the  face  of 
high  energy  costs  required  shifts  in  the  industrial  structure. 

Changing  price  conditions  favored  conservation  and  alternative 
sources  of  industrial  energy.  Although  the  investment  costs  were 


200 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

high,  many  energy-intensive  industries  successfully  reduced  their 
dependence  on  oil  during  the  late  1970s  and  1980s  and  enhanced 
their  productivity.  Advances  in  microcircuitry  and  semiconduc- 
tors in  the  late  1970s  and  1980s  also  led  to  new  growth  industries 
in  consumer  electronics  and  computers  and  to  higher  productivity 
in  already  established  industries.  The  net  result  of  these  adjust- 
ments was  to  increase  the  energy  efficiency  of  manufacturing  and 
to  expand  so-called  knowledge-intensive  industry.  The  service  in- 
dustries expanded  in  an  increasingly  postindustrial  economy. 

Structural  economic  changes,  however,  were  unable  to  check  the 
slowing  of  economic  growth,  as  the  economy  matured  in  the  late 
1970s  and  1980s,  attaining  annual  growth  rates  no  better  than  4 
to  6  percent.  But,  these  rates  were  remarkable  in  a  world  of  ex- 
pensive petroleum  and  in  a  nation  of  few  domestic  resources. 
Japan's  average  growth  rate  of  5  percent  in  the  late  1980s,  for  ex- 
ample, was  far  higher  than  the  3.8  percent  growth  rate  of  the  United 
States. 

Despite  more  petroleum  price  increases  in  1979,  the  strength  of 
the  Japanese  economy  was  apparent.  It  expanded  without  the 
double-digit  inflation  that  afflicted  other  industrial  nations  and  that 
had  bothered  Japan  itself  after  the  first  oil  crisis  in  1973.  Japan 
experienced  slower  growth  in  the  mid-1980s,  but  its  demand- 
sustained  economic  boom  of  the  late  1980s  revived  many  troubled 
industries. 

Complex  economic  and  institutional  factors  affected  Japan's  post- 
war growth.  First,  the  nation's  prewar  experience  provided  several 
important  legacies.  The  Tokugawa  period  (1600-1867)  bequeathed 
a  vital  commercial  sector  in  burgeoning  urban  centers,  a  relatively 
well-educated  elite  (although  one  with  limited  knowledge  of  Euro- 
pean science),  a  sophisticated  government  bureaucracy,  produc- 
tive agriculture,  a  closely  unified  nation  with  highly  developed 
financial  and  marketing  systems,  and  a  national  infrastructure  of 
roads.  The  buildup  of  industry  during  the  Meiji  period  to  the  point 
where  Japan  could  vie  for  world  power  was  an  important  prelude 
to  postwar  growth  and  provided  a  pool  of  experienced  labor  fol- 
lowing World  War  II. 

Second,  and  more  important,  was  the  level  and  quality  of  in- 
vestment that  persisted  through  the  1980s.  Investment  in  capital 
equipment,  which  averaged  more  than  1 1  percent  of  GNP  during 
the  prewar  period,  rose  to  some  20  percent  of  GNP  during  the  1950s 
and  to  more  than  30  percent  in  the  late  1960s  and  1970s.  During 
the  economic  boom  of  the  late  1980s,  the  rate  still  kept  to  around 
20  percent.  Japanese  businesses  imported  the  latest  technologies 
to  develop  the  industrial  base.  As  a  latecomer  to  modernization, 


201 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Japan  was  able  to  avoid  some  of  the  trial  and  error  earlier  needed 
by  other  nations  to  develop  industrial  processes.  In  the  1970s  and 
1980s,  Japan  improved  its  industrial  base  through  technology  licens- 
ing, patent  purchases,  and  the  imitation  and  improvement  of  for- 
eign inventions.  In  the  1980s,  industry  stepped  up  its  research  and 
development,  and  many  firms  became  famous  for  their  innova- 
tions and  creativity. 

Japan's  labor  force  contributed  importandy  to  economic  growth, 
not  only  because  of  its  availability  and  literacy,  but  also  because 
of  its  reasonable  wage  demands.  Before  and  immediately  after 
World  War  II,  the  transfer  of  numerous  agricultural  workers  to 
modern  industry  resulted  in  rising  productivity  and  only  moder- 
ate wage  increases.  As  population  growth  slowed  and  the  nation 
became  increasingly  industrialized  in  the  mid-1960s,  wages  rose 
significantly.  But  labor  union  cooperation  generally  kept  salary  in- 
creases within  the  range  of  productivity  gains. 

High  productivity  growth  played  a  key  role  in  postwar  economic 
growth.  The  highly  skilled  and  educated  labor  force,  extraordinary 
savings  rates  and  accompanying  levels  of  investment,  and  the  low 
growth  of  Japan's  labor  force  were  major  factors  in  the  high  rate 
of  productivity  growth. 

The  nation  has  also  benefited  from  economies  of  scale.  Although 
medium- sized  and  small  enterprises  generated  much  of  the  nation's 
employment,  large  facilities  were  most  productive.  Many  indus- 
trial enterprises  consolidated  to  form  larger,  more  efficient  units. 
Before  World  War  II,  large  holding  companies  formed  wealth 
groups,  or  zaibatsu  (see  Glossary),  which  dominated  most  indus- 
try. The  zaibatsu  were  dissolved  after  the  war,  but  keiretsu — large 
and  modern  industrial  enterprise  groupings — emerged.  The  coor- 
dination of  activities  within  these  groupings  and  the  integration 
of  smaller  subcontractors  into  the  groups  enhanced  industrial  effi- 
ciency. 

Japanese  corporations  developed  strategies  that  contributed  to 
their  immense  growth.  Growth-oriented  corporations  that  took 
chances  competed  successfully.  Product  diversification  became  an 
essential  ingredient  of  the  growth  patterns  of  many  keiretsu.  Japanese 
companies  added  plant  and  human  capacity  ahead  of  demand.  Seek- 
ing market  share  rather  than  quick  profit  was  another  powerful 
strategy. 

Finally,  circumstances  beyond  Japan's  direct  control  contributed 
to  its  success.  International  conflicts  tended  to  stimulate  the  Japanese 
economy  until  the  devastation  at  the  end  of  World  War  II.  The 
Russo-Japanese  War  (1904-5),  World  War  I  (1914-18),  the  Korean 
War  (1950-53),  and  the  Second  Indochina  War  (1954-75)  brought 


202 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

economic  booms  to  Japan.  In  addition,  benign  treatment  from  the 
United  States  after  World  War  II  facilitated  the  nation's  recon- 
struction and  growth.  The  United  States  occupation  of  Japan 
(1945-52)  resulted  in  the  rebuilding  of  the  nation  and  the  creation 
of  a  democratic  state.  United  States  assistance  totaled  about  US$1 .9 
billion  during  the  occupation,  or  about  15  percent  of  the  nation's 
imports  and  4  percent  of  GNP  in  that  period.  About  59  percent 
of  this  aid  was  in  the  form  of  food;  15  percent  in  industrial  materi- 
als, and  12  percent  in  transportation  equipment.  United  States  grant 
assistance,  however,  tapered  off  quickly  in  the  mid-1950s.  United 
States  military  procurement  from  Japan  peaked  at  a  level  equiva- 
lent to  7  percent  of  Japan's  GNP  in  1953  and  fell  below  1  percent 
after  1960.  A  variety  of  United  States-sponsored  measures  during 
the  occupation,  such  as  land  reform,  contributed  to  the  economy's 
later  performance  by  increasing  competition.  In  particular,  the  post- 
war purge  of  industrial  leaders  allowed  new  talent  to  rise  in  the 
management  of  the  nation's  rebuilt  industries.  Finally,  the  econ- 
omy benefited  from  foreign  trade,  as  it  was  able  to  expand  exports 
rapidly  enough  to  pay  for  imports  of  equipment  and  technology 
without  falling  into  debt  as  have  a  number  of  developing  nations 
in  the  1980s,  (see  Level  and  Commodity  Composition  of  Trade, 
ch.  5). 

The  consequences  of  Japan's  economic  growth  were  not  always 
positive.  Large  advanced  corporations  existed  side-by-side  with  the 
smaller  and  technologically  less-developed  firms,  creating  a  kind 
of  economic  dualism  in  the  late  twentieth  century.  Often  the  smaller 
firms,  which  employed  more  than  two-thirds  of  Japan's  workers, 
worked  as  subcontractors  directly  for  larger  firms,  supplying  a  nar- 
row range  of  parts  and  temporary  workers.  Excellent  working  con- 
ditions, salaries,  and  benefits,  such  as  permanent  employment,  were 
provided  by  most  large  firms,  but  not  by  the  smaller  firms.  Tem- 
porary workers,  mostly  women,  received  much  smaller  salaries  and 
had  less  job  security  than  permanent  workers.  Thus,  despite  the 
high  living  standards  of  many  workers  in  larger  firms,  Japan  in 
1990  remained  in  general  a  low- wage  country  whose  economic 
growth  was  fueled  by  highly  skilled  and  educated  workers  who  ac- 
cepted poor  salaries,  often  unsafe  working  conditions,  and  poor 
living  standards  (see  table  10,  Appendix). 

Additionally,  Japan's  preoccupation  with  boosting  the  rate  of 
industrial  growth  during  the  1950s  and  1960s  led  to  the  relative 
neglect  of  consumer  services  and  also  to  the  worsening  of  indus- 
trial pollution.  Housing  and  urban  services,  such  as  water  and  sew- 
age systems,  and  social  security  benefits,  lagged  behind  the 
development  of  industry,  and  despite  considerable  improvement 


203 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  still  lagged  well  behind  other  industrial- 
ized nations  at  the  end  of  the  1980s.  Agricultural  subsidies  and 
a  complex  and  outmoded  distribution  system  also  kept  the  prices 
of  some  essential  consumer  goods  very  high  by  world  standards 
(see  Living  Standards,  this  ch.).  Industrial  growth  came  at  the  ex- 
pense of  the  environment.  Foul  air,  heavily  polluted  water,  and 
waste  disposal  became  critical  political  issues  in  the  1970s  and  again 
in  the  late  1980s  (see  Pollution,  ch.  2). 

The  Evolving  Occupational  Structure 

As  late  as  1955,  some  40  percent  of  the  labor  force  still  worked 
in  agriculture,  but  this  figure  had  declined  to  17  percent  by  1970 
and  to  8.3  percent  by  1988.  The  government  estimated  in  the  late 
1980s  that  this  figure  would  decline  to  4.9  percent  by  2000,  as  Japan 
imported  more  and  more  of  its  food  and  small  family  farms  disap- 
peared. 

Japan's  economic  growth  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  was  based  on 
the  rapid  expansion  of  heavy  manufacturing  in  such  areas  as  au- 
tomobiles, steel,  shipbuilding,  chemicals,  and  electronics.  The 
secondary  sector  (manufacturing,  construction,  and  mining)  ex- 
panded to  35.6  percent  of  the  work  force  by  1970.  By  the  late  1970s, 
however,  the  Japanese  economy  began  to  move  away  from  heavy 
manufacturing  toward  a  more  service-oriented  (tertiary  sector)  base. 
During  the  1980s,  jobs  in  wholesaling,  retailing,  finance  and  in- 
surance, real  estate,  transportation,  communications,  and  govern- 
ment grew  rapidly,  while  secondary  sector  employment  remained 
stable.  The  tertiary  sector  grew  from  47  percent  of  the  work  force 
in  1970  to  58  percent  in  1987  and  was  expected  to  grow  to  62  per- 
cent by  2000,  when  the  secondary  sector  will  probably  employ  33 
percent  of  Japan's  workers. 

The  Role  of  Government  and  Business 

Although  Japan's  economic  development  was  primarily  the 
product  of  private  entrepreneurship,  the  government  has  directly 
contributed  to  the  nation's  prosperity.  Its  actions  have  helped  in- 
itiate new  industries,  cushion  the  effects  of  economic  depression, 
create  a  sound  economic  infrastructure,  and  protect  the  living  stan- 
dards of  the  citizenry.  Indeed,  so  pervasive  has  government  in- 
fluence in  the  economy  seemed  that  many  foreign  observers  have 
popularized  the  term  '  'Japan  Incorporated' '  to  describe  its  alliance 
of  business  and  government  interests.  Whether  Japan  in  1990  ac- 
tually fit  this  picture  seemed  questionable,  but  there  was  little  doubt 
that  government  agencies  continued  to  influence  the  economy 
through  a  variety  of  policies. 


204 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

Japanese  attitudes  towards  government  have  historically  been 
shaped  by  Confucianism  (see  Cultural  Developments  and  the  Es- 
tablishment of  Buddhism,  ch.  1;  and  Religious  and  Philosophical 
Traditions,  ch.  2).  Japan  often  has  been  defined  as  a  Confucian 
country,  but  one  in  which  loyalty  is  more  important  than  benevo- 
lence. Leadership  stemmed  from  the  government  and  authority 
in  general,  and  business  looked  to  government  for  guidance.  These 
attitudes,  coupled  with  the  view  of  the  nation  as  a  family,  allowed 
government  to  influence  business,  and  businesses  worked  hard  not 
only  for  their  own  profits,  but  also  for  national  well-being.  There 
was  a  national  consensus  that  Japan  must  be  an  economic  power 
and  that  the  duty  of  all  Japanese  was  to  sacrifice  themselves  for 
this  national  goal.  Thus,  the  relationship  between  government  and 
business  was  as  collaborators  rather  than  as  mutually  suspicious 
adversaries. 

Government-business  relations  were  conducted  in  many  ways 
and  through  numerous  channels.  The  most  important  conduits  in 
the  postwar  period  were  the  economic  ministries:  the  Ministry  of 
Finance  and  the  Ministry  of  International  Trade  and  Industry, 
known  as  MITI  (see  Trade  and  Investment  Institutions,  ch.  5). 
The  Ministry  of  Finance  had  operational  responsibilities  for  all  fiscal 
affairs,  including  the  preparation  of  the  national  budget  (see  table 
11,  Appendix).  It  initiated  fiscal  policies  and,  through  its  indirect 
control  over  the  Bank  of  Japan,  the  central  bank,  was  responsible 
for  monetary  policy  as  well.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  allocated  pub- 
lic investment,  formulated  tax  policies,  collected  taxes,  and  regu- 
lated foreign  exchange. 

The  Ministry  of  Finance  established  low  interest  rates,  and  by 
thus  reducing  the  cost  of  investment  funds  to  corporations,  pro- 
moted industrial  expansion.  MITI  was  responsible  for  the  regula- 
tion of  production  and  the  distribution  of  goods  and  services.  It 
was  the  "steward"  of  the  Japanese  economy,  developing  plans  con- 
cerning the  structure  of  Japanese  industry.  MITI  had  several  spe- 
cial functions  in  the  late  1980s:  controlling  Japan's  foreign  trade 
and  supervising  international  commerce,  ensuring  the  smooth  flow 
of  goods  in  the  national  economy,  promoting  the  development  of 
manufacturing,  mining,  and  distribution  industries,  and  supervising 
the  procurement  of  a  reliable  supply  of  raw  materials  and  energy 
resources. 

The  Ministry  of  Transportation  was  responsible  for  oversight 
of  all  land,  sea,  and  air  transport.  The  Ministry  of  Construction 
was  charged  with  supervising  all  construction  in  Japan  and  Japa- 
nese-supported construction  abroad.  Its  responsibilities  also  included 
land  acquisition  for  public  use  and  environmental  protection  as  it 


205 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

related  to  construction.  The  Ministry  of  Health  and  Welfare  was 
responsible  for  supervising  and  coordinating  all  health  and  wel- 
fare services,  and  the  Ministry  of  Posts  and  Telecommunications 
was  responsible  for  the  postal  service  and  electronic  communi- 
cations. 

Industrial  Policy 

After  World  War  II  and  especially  in  the  1950s  and  1960s,  the 
Japanese  government  devised  a  complicated  system  of  policies  to 
promote  industrial  development  and  cooperated  closely  for  this  pur- 
pose with  private  firms.  The  objective  of  industrial  policy  was  to 
shift  resources  to  specific  industries,  to  gain  international  competi- 
tive advantage  for  Japan.  These  policies  and  methods  were  used 
primarily  to  increase  the  productivity  of  inputs  and  to  influence, 
directly  or  indirectly,  industrial  investment. 

Administrative  guidance  (gydsei  shido)  was  a  principal  instrument 
of  enforcement  used  extensively  throughout  the  Japanese  govern- 
ment to  support  a  wide  range  of  policies.  Influence,  prestige,  ad- 
vice, and  persuasion  were  used  to  encourage  both  corporations  and 
individuals  to  work  in  directions  judged  desirable.  The  persuasion 
was  exerted  and  the  advice  was  given  by  public  officials,  who  often 
had  the  power  to  provide  or  withhold  loans,  grants,  subsidies, 
licenses,  tax  concessions,  government  contracts,  import  permits, 
foreign  exchange,  and  approval  of  cartel  arrangements.  The 
Japanese  used  administrative  guidance  to  buffer  market  swings, 
anticipate  market  developments,  and  enhance  market  competition 
(see  Foreign  Trade  Policies,  ch.  5). 

Mechanisms  used  by  the  Japanese  government  to  affect  the  econ- 
omy typically  related  to  trade,  labor  markets,  competition,  and  tax 
incentives.  They  included  a  broad  range  of  trade  protection  mea- 
sures, subsidies,  de  jure  and  de  facto  exemptions  from  antitrust 
statutes,  labor  market  adjustments,  and  industry- specific  assistance 
to  enhance  the  use  of  new  technology.  Rather  than  producing  a 
broad  range  of  goods,  the  Japanese  selected  a  few  areas  in  which 
they  could  develop  high-quality  goods  that  they  could  produce  in 
vast  quantities  at  competitive  prices.  A  good  example  is  the  camera 
industry,  which  since  the  1960s  has  been  dominated  by  Japan. 

Historically,  there  have  been  three  main  elements  in  Japanese 
industrial  development.  The  first  was  the  development  of  a  highly 
competitive  manufacturing  sector.  The  second  was  the  deliberate 
restructuring  of  industry  toward  higher  value-added,  high-produc- 
tivity industries.  In  the  late  1980s,  these  were  mainly  knowledge- 
intensive  tertiary  industries.  The  third  element  was  aggressive 
domestic  and  international  business  strategies. 


206 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

Japan  has  few  natural  resources  and  depends  on  massive  im- 
ports of  raw  materials.  It  must  export  to  pay  for  its  imports,  and 
manufacturing  and  the  sales  of  its  services,  such  as  banking  and 
finance,  were  its  principal  means  of  doing  so.  For  these  reasons, 
the  careful  development  of  the  producing  sector  was  a  key  con- 
cern of  both  government  and  industry  throughout  most  of  the  twen- 
tieth century.  Government  and  business  leaders  generally  agreed 
that  the  composition  of  Japan's  output  must  continually  shift  if  living 
standards  were  to  rise.  Government  played  an  active  role  in  mak- 
ing these  shifts,  often  anticipating  economic  developments  rather 
than  reacting  to  them. 

After  World  War  II,  the  initial  industries  that  policy  makers  and 
the  general  public  felt  Japan  should  have  were  iron  and  steel,  ship- 
building, the  merchant  marine,  machine  industries  in  general, 
heavy  electrical  equipment,  and  chemicals.  Later  they  added  the 
automobile  industry,  petrochemicals,  and  nuclear  power,  and  in 
the  1980s,  such  industries  as  computers  and  semiconductors.  Since 
the  late  1970s,  the  government  has  strongly  encouraged  the  de- 
velopment of  knowledge-intensive  industries.  Government  support 
for  research  and  development  grew  rapidly  in  the  1980s,  and  large 
joint  government-industry  development  projects  in  computers  and 
robotics  were  started.  At  the  same  time,  government  promoted  the 
managed  decline  of  competitively  troubled  industries,  including 
textiles,  shipbuilding,  and  chemical  fertilizers,  through  such  mea- 
sures as  tax  breaks  for  corporations  that  retrained  workers  to  work 
at  other  tasks. 

Although  industrial  policy  remained  important  in  Japan  in  the 
1970s  and  1980s,  thinking  began  to  change.  Government  seemed 
to  intervene  less  and  become  more  respective  of  price  mechanisms 
in  guiding  future  development.  During  this  period,  trade  and  direct 
foreign  investment  were  liberalized,  tariff  and  nontariff  trade  bar- 
riers were  lowered,  and  the  economies  of  the  advanced  nations  be- 
came more  integrated,  with  the  growth  of  international  trade  and 
international  corporations.  In  the  late  1980s,  knowledge-intensive 
and  high-technology  industries  became  prominent.  The  govern- 
ment showed  little  inclination  to  promote  such  booming  parts  of 
the  economy  as  fashion  design,  advertising,  and  management  con- 
sulting. The  question  at  the  end  of  the  1980s  was  whether  the 
government  would  become  involved  in  such  new  developments  or 
whether  it  would  let  them  progress  on  their  own. 

Monetary  and  Fiscal  Policy 

Monetary  policy  pertained  to  the  regulation,  availability,  and  cost 
of  credit,  while  fiscal  policy  dealt  with  government  expenditures, 


207 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

taxes,  and  debt.  Through  management  of  these  areas,  the  Minis- 
try of  Finance  regulated  the  allocation  of  resources  in  the  econ- 
omy, affected  the  distribution  of  income  and  wealth  among  the 
citizenry,  stabilized  the  level  of  economic  activities,  and  promoted 
economic  growth  and  welfare. 

The  Ministry  of  Finance  played  an  important  role  in  Japan's 
postwar  economic  growth.  It  advocated  a  "growth  first"  approach, 
with  a  high  proportion  of  government  spending  going  to  capital 
accumulation,  and  minimum  government  spending  overall,  which 
kept  both  taxes  and  deficit  spending  down,  making  more  money 
available  for  private  investment.  Most  Japanese  put  money  into 
savings  accounts  (see  table  12,  Appendix). 

In  the  postwar  period,  the  government's  fiscal  policy  centered 
on  the  formulation  of  the  national  budget,  which  was  the  respon- 
sibility of  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  The  ministry's  Budget  Bureau 
prepared  expenditure  budgets  for  each  fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glos- 
sary) based  on  the  requests  from  government  ministries  and  af- 
filiated agencies.  The  ministry's  Tax  Bureau  was  responsible  for 
adjusting  the  tax  schedules  and  estimating  revenues.  The  minis- 
try also  issued  government  bonds,  controlled  government  borrow- 
ing, and  administered  the  Fiscal  Investment  and  Loan  Program, 
which  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  the  "second  budget." 

Three  types  of  budgets  were  prepared  for  review  of  the  National 
Diet  each  year  (see  The  Legislature,  ch.  6).  The  general  account 
budget  included  most  of  the  basic  expenditures  for  current  govern- 
ment operations.  Special  account  budgets,  of  which  there  were  about 
forty,  were  designed  for  special  programs  or  institutions  where  close 
accounting  of  revenues  and  expenditures  was  essential:  for  public 
enterprises,  state  pension  funds,  and  public  works  projects  financed 
from  special  taxes.  Finally,  there  were  the  budgets  for  the  major 
public  enterprises,  including  public  service  corporations,  loan  and 
finance  institutions,  and  the  special  public  banks  (see  table  13,  Ap- 
pendix). Although  these  budgets  were  usually  approved  before  the 
start  of  each  fiscal  year,  they  were  usually  revised  with  supplemental 
budgets  in  the  fall.  Local  jurisdiction  budgets  depended  heavily 
on  transfers  from  the  central  government. 

Government  fixed  investments  in  infrastructure  and  loans  to  pub- 
lic and  private  enterprises  were  about  15  percent  of  GNP.  Loans 
from  the  Fiscal  Investment  and  Loan  Program,  which  were  out- 
side the  general  budget  and  funded  primarily  from  postal  savings, 
represented  more  than  20  percent  of  the  general  account  budget, 
but  their  total  effect  on  economic  investment  was  not  completely 
accounted  for  in  the  national  income  statistics.  Taxes,  represent- 
ing 14  percent  of  GNP  in  1987,  were  low  compared  to  those  in

other  developed  economies.  Taxes  provided  87.8  percent  of 
revenues  in  1990.  Income  taxes  were  graduated  and  progressive. 
The  principal  structural  feature  of  the  tax  system  was  the  tre- 
mendous elasticity  of  the  individual  income  tax.  Because  inheritance 
and  property  taxes  were  low,  there  was  a  slowly  increasing 
concentration  of  wealth  in  the  upper  tax  brackets.  In  1989,  the 
government  introduced  a  major  tax  reform,  including  a  3  percent 
consumption  tax. 

The  Financial  System 

In  the  mid-1980s,  while  the  United  States  was  becoming  a  debtor 
nation,  Japan  became  the  world's  largest  creditor  and  Tokyo  a 
major  international  financial  center.  Four  of  the  biggest  banks  in 
the  world  were  Japanese  at  that  time  and  Japan  had  the  world's 
largest  insurance  company,  advertising  firm,  and  stock  market. 
In  the  remainder  of  the  1980s,  Japan's  financial  and  banking  in- 
dustries grew  at  unprecedented  rates. 

The  main  elements  of  Japan's  financial  system  were  much  the 
same  as  those  of  other  major  industrialized  nations:  a  commercial 
banking  system,  which  accepted  deposits,  extended  loans  to  busi- 
nesses, and  dealt  in  foreign  exchange;  specialized  government- 
owned  financial  institutions,  which  funded  various  sectors  of  the 
domestic  economy;  securities  companies,  which  provided  broker- 
age services,  underwrote  corporate  and  government  securities,  and 
dealt  in  securities  markets;  capital  markets,  which  offered  the  means 
to  finance  public  and  private  debt  and  to  sell  residual  corporate 
ownership;  and  money  markets,  which  offered  banks  a  source  of 
liquidity  and  provided  the  Bank  of  Japan  with  a  tool  to  implement 
monetary  policy. 

Japan's  traditional  banking  system  was  segmented  into  clearly 
defined  components  in  the  late  1980s:  commercial  banks  (thirteen 
major  and  sixty-four  smaller  regional  banks),  long-term  credit  banks 
(seven),  trust  banks  (seven),  mutual  loan  and  savings  banks  (sixty- 
nine),  and  various  specialized  financial  institutions.  During  the 
1980s,  a  rapidly  growing  group  of  nonbank  operations,  such  as 
consumer  loan,  credit  card,  leasing,  and  real  estate  organizations 
began  performing  some  of  the  traditional  functions  of  banks,  such 
as  the  issuing  of  loans. 

In  the  early  postwar  financial  system,  city  banks  provided  short- 
term  loans  to  major  domestic  corporations  while  regional  banks 
took  deposits  and  extended  loans  to  medium-sized  and  small  busi- 
nesses. Neither  engaged  much  in  international  business.  In  the 
1950s  and  1960s,  a  specialized  bank,  the  Bank  of  Tokyo,  took  care 
of  most  of  the  government's  foreign  exchange  needs  and  functioned 


209

as  the  nation's  foreign  banking  representative.  Long-term  credit 
banks  were  intended  to  complement  rather  than  to  compete  with 
the  commercial  banks.  Authorized  to  issue  debentures  rather  than 
take  ordinary  deposits,  they  specialized  in  long-term  lending  to 
major  kaisha,  or  corporations.  Trust  banks  were  authorized  to  con- 
duct retail  and  trust  banking  and  often  combined  the  work  of  com- 
mercial and  long-term  credit  banks.  Trust  banks  not  only  managed 
portfolios  but  also  raised  funds  through  the  sale  of  negotiable  loan 
trust  certificates.  Mutual  loan  and  savings  banks,  credit  associa- 
tions, credit  cooperatives,  and  labor  credit  associations  collected 
individual  deposits  from  general  depositors.  These  deposits  were 
then  loaned  to  cooperative  members  and  to  the  liquidity- starved 
city  banks  via  the  inter-bank  money  markets  or  were  sent  to  cen- 
tral cooperative  banks,  which  in  turn  loaned  the  funds  to  small  busi- 
nesses and  corporations.  More  than  8,000  agricultural,  forestry, 
and  fishery  cooperatives  performed  many  of  the  same  functions 
for  the  cooperatives.  Many  of  their  funds  were  transmitted  to  their 
central  bank,  the  Norinchukin  Bank,  which  was  the  world's  larg- 
est bank  in  terms  of  domestic  deposits. 

A  group  of  government  financial  institutions  paralleled  the  pri- 
vate banking  sector.  The  Japan  Export-Import  Bank,  the  Japan 
Development  Bank,  and  a  number  of  finance  corporations,  such 
as  the  Housing  Loan  Corporation,  promoted  the  growth  of  special- 
ized sectors  of  the  domestic  economy.  These  institutions  derived 
their  funding  from  deposits  collected  by  the  postal  savings  system 
and  deposited  with  the  Trust  Fund  Bureau.  The  postal  savings  sys- 
tem, through  the  24,000  post  offices,  accepted  funds  in  various 
forms,  including  savings,  annuities,  and  insurance.  The  post  offices 
offered  the  highest  interest  rates  for  regular  savings  accounts  (8 
percent  for  time  deposits  in  1990)  and  tax  free  savings  until  1988, 
thereby  collecting  more  deposits  and  accounts  than  any  other  in- 
stitution in  the  world. 

Japan's  securities  markets  increased  their  volume  of  dealings 
rapidly  during  the  late  1980s,  led  by  Japan's  rapidly  expanding 
securities  firms.  There  were  three  categories  of  securities  compa- 
nies in  Japan,  the  first  consisting  of  the  "Big  Four"  securities  houses 
(among  the  six  largest  such  firms  in  the  world):  Nomura,  Daiwa, 
Nikko,  and  Yamaichi.  The  Big  Four  played  a  key  role  in  interna- 
tional financial  transactions  and  were  members  of  the  New  York 
Stock  Exchange.  Nomura  was  the  world's  largest  single  securities 
firm;  its  net  capital,  in  excess  of  US$10  billion  in  1986,  exceeded 
that  of  Merrill  Lynch,  Salomon  Brothers,  and  Shearson  Lehman 
combined.  In  1986  Nomura  became  the  first  Japanese  member  of 
the  London  Stock  Exchange.  Nomura  and  Daiwa  were  primary

dealers  in  the  United  States  Treasury  bond  market.  The  second 
tier  of  securities  firms  contained  ten  medium-sized  firms  and  the 
third  all  the  smaller  securities  firms  registered  in  Japan.  Many  of 
these  smaller  firms  were  affiliates  of  the  Big  Four,  while  some  were 
affiliated  with  banks.  In  1986  eighty-three  of  the  smaller  firms  were 
members  of  the  Tokyo  Securities  and  Stock  Exchange.  Japan's  secu- 
rities firms  derived  most  of  their  incomes  from  brokerage  fees,  equity 
and  bond  trading,  underwriting,  and  dealing.  Other  services  in- 
cluded the  administration  of  trusts.  In  the  late  1980s,  a  number 
of  foreign  securities  firms,  including  Salomon  Brothers  and  Merrill 
Lynch,  became  players  in  Japan's  financial  world. 

Japanese  insurance  companies  became  important  leaders  in  in- 
ternational finance  in  the  late  1980s.  More  than  90  percent  of  the 
population  owned  life  insurance,  and  the  amount  held  per  person 
was  at  least  50  percent  greater  than  in  the  United  States.  Many 
Japanese  used  insurance  companies  as  savings  vehicles.  Insurance 
companies'  assets  grew  at  a  rate  of  over  20  percent  per  year  in  the 
late  1980s,  reaching  nearly  US$694  billion  in  1988.  These  assets 
permitted  the  companies  to  become  major  players  in  international 
money  markets.  Nippon  Life  Insurance  Company,  the  world's  larg- 
est insurance  firm,  was  reportedly  the  biggest  single  holder  of  United 
States  Treasury  securities  in  1989.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

The  Tokyo  Securities  and  Stock  Exchange  became  the  largest 
in  the  world  in  1988,  in  terms  of  the  combined  market  value  of 
outstanding  shares  and  capitalization,  while  the  Osaka  Stock  Ex- 
change ranked  third  after  those  of  Tokyo  and  New  York.  Although 
there  are  eight  stock  exchanges  in  Japan,  the  Tokyo  stock  exchange 
represented  83  percent  of  the  nation's  total  equity  in  1988.  Of  the 
1,848  publicly  traded  domestic  companies  in  Japan  at  the  end  of 
1986,  about  80  percent  were  listed  on  the  Tokyo  stock  exchange. 

Two  developments  in  the  late  1980s  helped  in  the  rapid  expan- 
sion of  the  Tokyo  Securities  and  Stock  Exchange.  The  first  was 
a  change  in  the  financing  of  company  operations.  Traditionally, 
large  firms  obtained  funding  through  bank  loans  rather  than  capi- 
tal markets,  but  in  the  late  1980s  they  began  to  rely  more  on  direct 
financing.  The  second  development  came  in  1986  when  the  Tokyo 
exchange  permitted  non-Japanese  brokerage  firms  to  become  mem- 
bers for  the  first  time.  By  1988  the  exchange  had  sixteen  foreign 
members.  The  Tokyo  Securities  and  Stock  Exchange  had  124  mem- 
ber companies  all  told  in  mid- 1990. 

Japan's  stock  market  dealings  exploded  in  the  1980s,  with  in- 
creased trading  volume  and  rapidly  rising  stock  prices.  The  Nikkei 
Stock  Average  grew  from  6,850  in  October  1982  to  nearly  39,000 
in  early  1990.  During  one  six-month  period  in  1986,  total  trade 
volume  on  the  Tokyo  exchange  increased  by  250  percent  with  wild 
swings  in  the  Nikkei  average.  After  the  plunge  of  the  New  York 
Stock  Exchange  in  October  1987,  the  Tokyo  average  dropped  by 
15  percent,  but  there  was  a  sharp  recovery  by  early  1988.  In  1990 
five  types  of  securities  were  traded  on  the  Tokyo  exchange:  stocks, 
bonds,  investment  trusts,  rights,  and  warrants  alone. 

Public  Corporations 

Although  the  Japanese  economy  is  largely  based  on  private  en- 
terprise, it  does  have  a  number  of  government-owned  (public)  cor- 
porations, which  are  more  extensive  and,  in  some  cases,  different 
in  function  from  what  exists  in  the  United  States.  In  1988  there 
were  97  public  corporations,  reduced  from  111  in  the  early  1980s 
as  a  result  of  administrative  reforms.  Public  companies  at  the  na- 
tional level  were  normally  affiliated  with  one  of  the  economic  minis- 
tries, although  the  extent  of  direct  management  and  supervision 
varied.  The  government  divided  the  national-level  corporations  into 
several  categories.  The  first  included  the  main  public  service  and 
monopoly  corporations:  Nippon  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Cor- 
poration, Japanese  National  Railways,  and  Japan  Tobacco  and 
Salt  Public  Corporation.  However,  Nippon  Telegraph  and  Tele- 
phone Corporation  was  privatized  in  1985,  the  Japanese  National 


212 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

Railways  in  1987,  and  the  Japan  Tobacco  and  Salt  Corporation 
in  1988.  The  second  category  included  the  major  development 
corporations  devoted  to  housing,  agriculture,  highways,  water  re- 
sources, ports,  energy  resources,  and  urban  development  projects. 
Other  categories  of  corporations  included  those  charged  with  spe- 
cial government  projects,  loans  and  finance,  and  special  types  of 
banking.  Local  public  corporations  were  involved  with  utilities. 

Public  corporations  benefited  the  economy  in  several  ways.  Some, 
like  Nippon  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Corporation  before  privati- 
zation, were  important  sources  of  technology  development  funds 
or  centers  around  which  private  industry  could  cluster.  Others 
provided  vital  public  services  that  private  industry  would  find  im- 
possible to  finance.  The  development  banks,  particularly  the  Japan 
Development  Bank,  were  sources  of  long-term  investment  funds 
and  instrumental  in  shaping  the  pattern  of  industry,  especially  in 
the  early  postwar  period.  Because  public  corporations  also  added 
revenue  to  the  national  budget  and  were,  theoretically,  self- financ- 
ing, they  required  litde  from  the  government  in  the  way  of  financial 
support.  They  also  provided  employment  for  retired  bureaucrats. 
The  reemployment  of  retired  bureaucrats  as  advisors  to  these  cor- 
porations as  well  as  many  private- sector  firms  was  rather  common, 
especially  in  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s,  under  the  tide  amakudari 
(descent  from  heaven).  The  practice  was  most  prevalent  in  the  high- 
regulated  banking,  steel,  and  transportation  industries,  but  was 
found  throughout  the  Japanese  economy. 

Public  corporations  also  had  a  negative  side.  Their  operations 
were  apt  to  be  less  efficient  than  those  of  the  private  sector,  and 
in  some  corporations,  close  government  supervision  impeded  cor- 
porate responsibility.  Conflicts  between  corporate  heads,  who  were 
retired  from  competing  ministries,  and  envy  among  career  em- 
ployees, who  saw  their  advancement  blocked  by  the  influx  of  re- 
tired officials,  also  created  frequent  management  problems.  Labor 
relations  were  also  less  harmonious  in  the  public  sector  than  the 
private  sector.  Some  of  Japan's  most  debilitating  strikes  and  work 
slowdowns  have  been  launched  by  public  transportation  workers. 

Private  Enterprise 

The  engine  of  Japanese  economic  growth  has  been  private  in- 
itiative and  enterprise,  together  with  strong  support  and  guidance 
from  the  government  and  from  labor.  The  most  numerous  enter- 
prises were  single  proprietorships,  of  which  there  were  over  4  mil- 
lion in  the  late  1980s.  The  dominant  form  of  organization,  however, 
was  the  corporation:  in  1988  some  2  million  corporations  employed 
more  than  30  million  workers,  or  nearly  half  of  the  total  labor  force 


213 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

of  60.1  million  people.  Corporations  ranged  from  large  to  small, 
but  the  favored  type  of  organization  was  the  joint- stock  company, 
with  directors,  auditors,  and  yearly  stockholders'  meetings. 

Japan's  postwar  business  order  dates  back  to  the  dissolution  of 
the  zaibatsu  during  the  Allied  occupation.  Central  holding  companies 
were  dissolved  and  families  and  other  owners  were  compensated 
with  non-negotiable  government  bonds.  Individual  operating  firms 
were  then  freed  to  act  independentiy.  At  the  same  time,  the  govern- 
ment instituted  antimonopoly  legislation  and  formed  the  Fair  Trade 
Commission.  Together  with  agricultural  land  reform  and  the  start 
of  the  labor  movement,  these  measures  helped  introduce  a  degree 
of  competition  into  markets  that  had  not  previously  existed. 

It  was  not  long,  however,  before  the  spirit  and  letter  of  these 
reform  laws  were  neglected.  During  the  1950s,  government  guid- 
ance of  industry  often  sidestepped  the  provisions  of  the  law.  While 
market  forces  determined  the  course  of  the  vast  majority  of  enter- 
prise activities,  adjustments  in  the  allocation  of  bank  credit  and 
the  formation  of  cartels  favored  the  reemergence  of  conglomerate 
groupings.  These  groups  competed  vigorously  with  one  another 
for  market  shares  both  within  and  outside  Japan,  but  they  domi- 
nated lesser  industry. 

In  contrast  to  the  dualism  of  the  prewar  era — featuring  a  giant 
gap  between  modern,  large  enterprises  and  the  smaller,  traditional 
firms — the  postwar  system  was  more  graduated.  Interlocking  pro- 
duction and  sales  arrangements  between  greater  and  smaller  en- 
terprises characterized  corporate  relations  in  most  markets.  The 
average  Japanese  business  executive  was  well  aware  of  the  firms 
that  led  production  and  sales  in  each  industry  and  sensitive  to 
minute  differentiations  of  rank  among  the  many  corporations. 

At  the  top  of  the  corporate  system  were  three  general  types  of 
corporate  groupings.  The  first  included  the  corporate  heirs  of  the 
zaibatsu  (including  many  of  the  same  firms),  and  the  second  con- 
sisted of  corporations  that  formed  around  major  commercial  banks. 
The  nation's  six  largest  groupings  were  in  these  categories.  Mitsui, 
Mitsubishi,  and  Sumitomo  were  former  zaibatsu,  while  other  group- 
ings were  formed  around  the  Fuji-Sankei,  Sanwa,  and  Dai-Ichi 
Kangyo  banking  giants.  A  third  type  of  corporate  grouping  devel- 
oped around  large  industrial  producers. 

The  relations  among  the  members  of  the  first  two  types  of  groups 
were  flexible,  informal,  and  quite  different  from  the  holding  com- 
pany pattern  of  the  prewar  days.  Coordination  took  place  at  peri- 
odic gatherings  of  corporation  presidents  and  chief  executive 
officers.  The  purpose  of  these  meetings  was  to  exchange  informa- 
tion and  ideas  rather  than  to  command  group  operations  in  a  formal 


214 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

way.  The  general  trading  firms  associated  with  each  group  could 
also  be  used  to  coordinate  group  finance,  production,  and  mar- 
keting policies  although  none  of  these  relationships  was  entirely 
exclusive  (see  Trading  Companies,  ch.  5).  The  practice  of  cross- 
holding  shares  of  group  stock  further  cemented  these  groups,  and 
such  holdings  usually  made  up  about  30  percent  of  the  total  group 
equity.  Member  corporations  would  typically,  though  not  exclu- 
sively, borrow  from  group  banks. 

Similar  relationships  characterized  the  third  type  of  corporate 
group,  which  established  around  a  major  industrial  producer.  Mem- 
bers of  this  group  were  often  subsidiaries  or  affiliates  of  the  parent 
firm,  or  regular  subcontractors.  Subsidiaries  and  contracting  cor- 
porations normally  built  components  for  the  parent  firm  and,  be- 
cause of  their  smaller  size,  afforded  several  benefits  to  the  parent. 
The  larger  firm  could  concentrate  on  final  assembly  and  high  value- 
added  processes,  while  the  smaller  firm  could  perform  specialized 
and  labor-intensive  tasks.  Cash  payments  to  the  subcontractors  were 
supplemented  by  commercial  bills  whose  maturity  could  be  post- 
poned when  the  need  arose.  In  the  late  1980s,  subcontracting  firms 
accounted  for  over  60  percent  of  Japan's  6  million  small  and 
medium-sized  enterprises  (those  having  fewer  than  300  employees). 

This  characterization  of  the  economy  as  consisting  of  neat,  hier- 
archical corporate  groupings  is  somewhat  simplistic.  In  the  1970s 
and  1980s,  a  number  of  independent  middle-sized  firms — especially 
in  the  services  and  retail  trade — were  busy  catering  to  increasingly 
diversified  and  specialized  markets.  Unaffiliated  with  the  nation's 
large  conglomerates,  these  corporations  dueled  each  other  in  a  high- 
ly competitive  market.  Bankruptcies  among  such  companies  and 
the  smaller  firms  were  much  more  common  than  among  the  large 
enterprises.  Small  business  was  the  main  provider  of  employment 
for  the  Japanese — two-thirds  of  Japanese  workers  were  employed 
by  small  firms  throughout  the  1980s — and  thereby  the  source  of 
consumer  demand;  it  engaged  in  almost  half  of  business  invest- 
ment as  well. 

The  issue  of  who  controlled  the  enterprise  system  was  complex. 
While  theoretically  corporations  were  owned  by  stockholders,  in- 
dividual stock-ownership  fell  throughout  the  1970s  and  1980s,  and 
in  1990  was  less  than  30  percent.  Financial  corporations  accounted 
for  the  remaining  70  percent  or  so.  Relative  to  capital,  almost  all 
large  corporations  carried  enormous  debt,  a  phenomenon  known 
as  overborrowing.  Such  an  unbalanced  capital  structure  resulted 
from  the  easy  availability  of  credit  from  the  main  group  bank  and 
the  network  of  corporate  relations,  which  reduced  the  need  to  resort 
to  capital  markets.  Corporate  shareholder  meetings  were  often  only 


215

window  dressing.  Thugs  sometimes  terrorized  stockholders,  de- 
manding payments  to  vote  for  management  or  refrain  from  ex- 
posing scandals.  The  auditing  system  also  was  not  well  developed. 
Until  the  late  1980s,  few  companies  engaged  outside  auditors,  and 
accounting  practices  gave  corporations  room  to  mislead  both  the 
public  and  shareholders.  The  law  was  changed  in  1981  to  control 
this  kind  of  excess,  to  enhance  the  power  of  auditors,  and  to  reduce 
the  number  of  stockholders  in  the  employ  of  management.  But  in 
general,  it  seemed  that  business  management  held  the  reins  of  cor- 
porate control,  often  with  little  public  accountability.  The  corporate 
system  maintained  itself  by  smoothing  relations  with  the  govern- 
ment bureaucracy,  expanding  benefits  to  workers  and  consumers, 
and  public  relations  and  philanthropy. 

The  Culture  of  Japanese  Management 

The  culture  of  Japanese  management  so  famous  in  the  West  was 
generally  limited  to  Japan's  large  corporations.  These  flagships  of 
the  Japanese  economy  provided  their  workers  with  excellent  sala- 
ries and  working  conditions  and  secure  employment.  These  com- 
panies and  their  employees  were  the  business  elite  of  Japan.  A  career 
with  such  a  company  was  the  dream  of  many  young  people  in 
Japan,  but  only  a  select  few  attained  the  jobs.  Qualification  for 
employment  was  limited  to  the  men  and  the  few  women  who  gradu- 
ated from  the  top  thirty  colleges  and  universities  in  Japan. 

In  the  late  twentieth  century,  placement  and  advancement  of 
Japanese  workers  was  heavily  based  on  educational  background. 
Students  who  did  not  gain  admission  to  the  most  highly  rated  col- 
leges only  rarely  had  the  chance  to  work  for  a  large  company.  In- 
stead, they  had  to  seek  positions  in  small  and  medium- sized  firms 
that  could  not  offer  comparable  benefits  and  prestige.  The  quality 
of  one's  education  and,  more  importantly,  the  college  attended, 
played  decisive  roles  in  a  person's  career  (see  Higher  Education, 
ch.  3). 

Few  Japanese  attended  graduate  school,  and  graduate  training 
in  business  per  se  was  rare  in  the  1980s.  There  were  only  a  few 
business  school  programs  in  Japan.  Companies  provided  their  own 
training  and  showed  a  strong  preference  for  young  men  who  could 
be  trained  in  the  company  way.  Interest  in  a  person  whose  atti- 
tudes and  work  habits  were  shaped  outside  the  company  was  low. 
When  young  men  were  preparing  to  graduate  from  college,  the 
attempt  to  find  a  suitable  employer  began.  This  process  had  been 
very  difficult:  there  were  only  a  few  positions  in  the  best  govern- 
ment ministries,  and  quite  often  entry  into  a  good  firm  was  deter- 
mined by  competitive  examination.  In  the  1990s,  the  situation  was 


216 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

becoming  less  competitive  with  a  gradual  decrease  in  the  number 
of  candidates.  New  workers  enter  their  companies  as  a  group  on 
April  1  each  year. 

One  of  the  prominent  features  of  Japanese  management  was  the 
practice  of  permanent  employment  {shushin  koyo).  Permanent  em- 
ployment covered  the  minority  of  the  work  force  that  worked  for 
the  major  companies.  Management  trainees,  traditionally  nearly 
all  of  whom  were  men,  were  recruited  directly  from  colleges  when 
they  graduated  in  the  late  winter  and,  if  they  survived  a  six-month 
probationary  period  with  the  company,  were  expected  to  stay  with 
the  companies  for  their  entire  working  careers.  Employees  were 
not  dismissed  thereafter  on  any  grounds,  except  for  serious  breaches 
of  ethics. 

Permanent  employees  were  hired  as  generalists,  not  as  specialists 
for  a  specific  positions.  A  new  worker  was  not  hired  because  of 
any  special  skill  or  experience;  rather,  the  individual's  intelligence, 
educational  background,  and  personal  attitudes  and  attributes  were 
closely  examined.  On  entering  a  Japanese  corporation,  the  new 
employee  would  train  from  six  to  twelve  months  in  each  of  the  firm's 
major  offices  or  divisions.  Thus,  within  a  few  years  a  young  em- 
ployee would  know  every  facet  of  company  operations,  knowledge 
which  allowed  companies  to  be  more  productive. 

Another  unique  aspect  of  Japanese  management  in  the  late  twen- 
tieth century  was  the  system  of  promotion  and  reward.  An  impor- 
tant criterion  was  seniority.  Seniority  was  determined  by  the  year 
an  employee's  class  entered  the  company.  Career  progression  was 
highly  predictable,  regulated,  and  automatic.  Compensation  for 
young  workers  was  quite  low,  but  they  accepted  low  pay  with  the 
understanding  that  their  pay  would  increase  in  regular  increments 
and  be  quite  high  by  retirement.  Compensation  consisted  of  a  wide 
range  of  tangible  and  intangible  benefits,  including  housing  as- 
sistance, inexpensive  vacations,  good  recreational  facilities,  and, 
most  importantly,  the  availability  of  low-cost  loans  for  such  things 
as  housing  and  a  new  car.  Regular  pay  was  often  augmented  by 
generous  semiannual  bonuses.  Members  of  the  same  graduating 
class  usually  started  with  similar  salaries,  and  salary  increases  and 
promotions  each  year  were  generally  uniform.  The  purpose  was 
to  maintain  harmony  and  avoid  stress  and  jealousy  within  the 
group. 

Individual  evaluation,  however,  did  occur.  Early  in  a  worker's 
career  (by  age  thirty)  distinctions  were  made  in  pay  and  job  as- 
signments. During  the  latter  part  of  a  worker's  career  another  weed- 
ing took  place:  the  best  workers  were  selected  for  accelerated 
advancement  into  upper  management.  Those  employees  who  failed 


217 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


to  advance  were  forced  to  retire  from  the  company  in  their  mid-to 
late  fifties.  Retirement  did  not  necessarily  mean  a  life  of  leisure. 
Poor  pension  benefits  and  modest  social  security  meant  that  many 
people  had  to  continue  working  after  retiring  from  a  career.  Many 
management  retirees  worked  for  the  smaller  subsidiaries  of  the  large 
companies,  with  another  company,  or  with  the  large  company  it- 
self at  substantially  lower  salaries. 

A  few  major  corporations  in  the  late  1980s  were  experimenting 
with  variations  of  permanent  employment  and  automatic  promo- 
tion. Some  rewarded  harder  work  and  higher  production  with 
higher  raises  and  more  rapid  promotions,  but  most  retained  the 
more  traditional  forms  of  hiring  and  advancement.  A  few  compa- 
nies that  experienced  serious  reverses  laid  off  workers,  but  such 
instances  were  rare. 

Another  aspect  of  Japanese  management  was  the  company  union, 
which  most  regular  company  employees  were  obliged  to  join.  The 
worker  did  not  have  a  separate  skill  identification  outside  of  the 
company.  Despite  federations  of  unions  at  the  national  level,  the 
union  did  not  exist  as  an  entity  separate  from,  or  with  an  adver- 
sarial relationship  to,  the  company.  The  linking  of  the  company 
with  the  worker  put  severe  limits  on  independent  union  action  and 
the  worker  did  not  wish  to  harm  the  economic  well-being  of  the 
company.  Strikes  were  rare  and  usually  brief. 

Japanese  managerial  style  and  decision  making  in  large  compa- 
nies emphasized  the  flow  of  information  and  initiative  from  the 
bottom  up,  making  top  management  a  facilitator  rather  than  the 
source  of  authority,  while  middle  management  was  both  the  impetus 
for  and  shaper  of  policy.  Consensus  was  stressed  as  a  way  of  arriv- 
ing at  decisions,  and  close  attention  was  paid  to  workers'  well-being. 
Rather  than  serve  as  an  important  decision  maker,  the  ranking 
officer  of  a  company  had  the  responsibility  of  maintaining  harmony 
so  that  employees  could  work  together.  A  Japanese  chief  execu- 
tive officer  was  a  consensus  builder. 

Employment  and  Labor  Relations 

Rising  labor  productivity,  particularly  in  the  manufacturing 
industries,  contributed  significantly  to  the  nation's  economic 
development.  Labor  productivity  was  unusually  high  in  the  late 
1970s,  when  Japan's  wages  first  became  competitive  with  other 
industrialized  nations.  But,  productivity  rose  at  an  annual  average 
rate  of  only  2.6  percent  between  1978  and  1987  (see  table  14,  Appen- 
dix). At  the  same  time,  Japan  was  able  to  keep  its  unemployment 
rate  between  2.3  and  3.0  percent  from  1985  to  1990.  The  struc- 
ture of  the  nation's  employment  system  and  relatively  harmonious 


218 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

labor-management  relations  were  two  of  the  reasons  for  this  en- 
viable performance. 

Employment,  Wages,  and  Working  Conditions 

Japan's  work  force  grew  by  less  than  1  percent  per  year  in  the 
1970s  and  1980s.  In  1990  it  stood  at  nearly  63  percent  of  the  total 
population  over  fifteen  years  of  age,  a  level  little  changed  since  1970. 
Labor  force  participation  differed  within  age  and  gender  group- 
ings and  was  similar  to  that  in  other  industrialized  nations  in  its 
relative  distribution  among  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  in- 
dustries. The  percentage  of  people  employed  in  the  primary  sec- 
tor (agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing)  dropped  from  17.4  in  1970 
to  8.3  in  1987  and  was  projected  to  fall  to  4.9  by  2000.  The  per- 
centage of  the  Japanese  labor  force  employed  in  heavy  industry 
was  33.7  in  1970;  it  dropped  to  33.1  in  1987  and  was  expected 
to  be  27.7  in  2000.  Light  industry  employed  47  percent  of  the  work 
force  in  1970  and  58  percent  in  1987.  The  sector  was  expected  to 
employ  62  percent  by  2000.  Throughout  the  1970s  and  1980s,  well 
over  95  percent  of  all  men  between  the  ages  of  twenty-five  and  fifty- 
four  were  in  the  work  force,  but  the  proportion  dropped  sharply 
after  the  usual  retirement  age  of  fifty-five  (by  1990  the  retirement 
age  for  most  men  had  risen  to  sixty).  Women  participated  most 
actively  in  the  job  market  in  their  early  twenties  and  between  the 
ages  of  thirty-five  and  fifty-four  (see  Gender  Stratification  and  the 
Lives  of  Women,  ch.  2).  The  unemployment  rate  (2.3  percent  in 
1989)  was  considerably  lower  than  in  the  other  industrialized 
nations. 

Wages  varied  by  industry  and  type  of  employment.  Regular 
workers  in  firms  with  more  than  thirty  employees,  those  in  finance, 
real  estate,  public  service,  petroleum,  publishing,  and  emerging 
high-technology  industries  earned  the  highest  wages.  The  lowest 
paid  were  those  in  textiles,  apparel,  furniture,  and  leather  products 
industries.  The  average  farmer  fared  even  worse.  During  the  period 
of  strong  economic  growth  from  1960  to  1973,  wage  levels  rose 
rapidly.  Nominal  wages  increased  an  average  of  13  percent  per 
year  while  real  wages  rose  7  percent  each  year.  Wage  levels  then 
stagnated  as  economic  growth  slowed.  Between  1973  and  1987  an- 
nual nominal  and  real  wage  increases  dropped  to  8  percent  and 
2  percent,  respectively.  Wages  began  rising  in  1987  as  the  value 
of  the  yen  sharply  appreciated.  In  1989  salaried  workers  receiving 
the  highest  average  pay  hikes  over  the  previous  year  were  newspaper 
employees  (6.7  percent),  followed  by  retail  and  wholesale  workers 
(6  percent)  and  hotel  employees  (5.7  percent).  Workers  in  the  steel 


219 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


(2.5  percent)  and  shipbuilding  (4.2  percent)  industries  fared  worse. 
The  salaries  of  administrative  and  technical  workers  were  about 
20  percent  higher  than  those  of  production  workers.  In  the  late 
1980s,  with  wages  in  manufacturing  firms  having  500  or  more  work- 
ers indexed  at  100,  enterprises  with  100  to  499  employees  were 
indexed  at  79,  those  with  30  to  99  employees  at  64,  and  those  with 
5  to  29  employees  at  56.6.  The  gap  between  wages  paid  to  second- 
ary school  and  college  graduates  was  slight,  but  widened  as  they 
grew  older  and  peaked  at  the  age  of  fifty-five,  when  the  former 
received  only  60  to  80  percent  of  the  wages  of  the  latter. 

Workers  received  two  fairly  large  bonuses  as  well  as  their  regu- 
lar salary,  one  mid-year  and  the  other  at  year's  end.  In  1988  work- 
ers in  large  companies  received  bonuses  equivalent  to  their  pay 
for  1 .9  months  while  workers  in  the  smallest  firms  gained  bonuses 
equal  to  1 .2  months'  pay.  In  addition  to  bonuses,  Japanese  work- 
ers received  a  number  of  fringe  benefits,  such  as  living  allowances, 
incentive  payments,  remuneration  for  special  job  conditions,  al- 
lowances for  good  attendance,  and  cost-of-living  allowances. 

Working  conditions  varied  from  firm  to  firm.  On  average,  em- 
ployees worked  a  forty-six-hour  week  in  1987;  employees  of  most 
large  corporations  worked  a  modified  five-day  week  with  two  Satur- 
days a  month,  while  those  in  most  small  firms  worked  as  much 
as  six  days  each  week.  In  the  face  of  mounting  international  criti- 
cism of  excessive  working  hours  in  Japan,  in  January  1989  public 
agencies  began  closing  two  Saturdays  a  month.  Labor  unions  made 
reduced  working  hours  an  important  part  of  their  demands,  and 
many  larger  firms  responded  in  a  positive  manner.  In  1986  the 
average  employee  in  manufacturing  and  production  industries 
worked  2,150  hours  in  Japan,  compared  to  1,924  hours  in  the 
United  States  and  1,643  in  France.  The  average  Japanese  worker 
was  entitled  to  fifteen  days  of  paid  vacation  a  year,  but  actually 
took  only  seven  days. 

The  Structure  of  Japan's  Labor  Market 

The  structure  of  Japan's  labor  market  was  experiencing  grad- 
ual change  in  the  late  1980s  and  was  expected  to  continue  this  trend 
throughout  the  1990s.  Labor  market  structure  was  affected  by  the 
aging  of  the  working  population,  increasing  numbers  of  women 
in  the  labor  force,  and  workers'  rising  education  level.  There  was 
the  prospect  of  increasing  numbers  of  foreign  nationals  in  the  labor 
force.  And,  finally,  the  labor  market  faced  possible  changes  owing 
to  younger  workers  who  sought  to  break  away  from  traditional 
career  paths  to  those  that  stressed  greater  individuality  and 
creativity.

Working  Women 

In  the  early  1990s,  Japanese  women  were  joining  the  labor  force 
in  unprecedented  numbers.  In  1987  there  were  23.6  million  work- 
ing women  (40  percent  of  the  labor  force),  and  they  accounted  for 
59  percent  of  the  increase  in  employment  from  1975  to  1987.  The 
participation  rate  for  women  in  the  labor  force  (the  ratio  of  those 
working  to  all  women  aged  fifteen  and  older)  rose  from  45.7  per- 
cent in  1975  to  48.6  percent  in  1987  and  was  expected  to  reach 
50  percent  by  2000. 

The  growing  participation  of  women  reflected  both  supply  and 
demand  factors.  Industries  such  as  wholesaling,  retailing,  banking, 
and  insurance  have  expanded,  in  large  part  because  of  the  effective 
use  of  women  as  part-time  employees  (see  Age  Structure;  ch.  2). 

Foreign  Workers 

Traditionally  Japan  has  had  strict  laws  regarding  the  employ- 
ment of  foreigners,  although  exceptions  were  made  for  certain 
occupational  categories.  Excepted  categories  have  included  execu- 
tives and  managers  engaged  in  commercial  activities,  full-time 
scholars  associated  with  research  and  education  institutions,  profes- 
sional entertainers,  engineers  and  others  specializing  in  advanced 


221 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


technology,  foreign-language  teachers,  and  others  with  special  skills 
unavailable  among  Japanese  nationals. 

The  problems  of  foreign  workers  in  the  labor  force  were  expected 
to  continue  in  the  1990s.  Despite  the  long-term  upward  trend  in 
the  unemployment  rate,  many  unpopular  jobs  went  unfilled  and 
the  domestic  labor  market  was  sluggish.  Imported  labor  was  seen 
as  a  solution  to  this  situation  by  some  employers,  who  hired  low- 
paid  foreign  workers,  who  were,  in  turn,  enticed  by  comparatively 
high  Japanese  wages.  The  strict  immigration  laws  were  expected 
to  remain  on  the  books,  however,  although  the  influx  of  illegal  aliens 
from  nearby  Asian  countries  to  participate  in  the  labor  market  was 
likely  to  increase  (see  table  16,  Appendix). 

Workers9  Changing  Attitudes 

The  success  of  corporations  in  Japan  was  attributable  to  the 
remarkable  motivation  of  its  workers.  Also  behind  this  corporate 
prosperity  was  the  workers'  strong  sense  of  loyalty  to  and  identifi- 
cation with  their  employers.  While  many  theories  have  evolved  to 
explain  the  extraordinary  attitude  of  Japanese  workers,  perhaps 
the  most  noteworthy  is  that  of  personnel  management.  This  view 
holds  that  loyalty  to  the  company  has  developed  as  a  result  of  job 
security  and  a  wage  system  in  which  those  with  the  greatest  seniority 
reap  the  highest  rewards.  Such  corporate  structure  presumably 
fostered  not  only  a  determined  interest  in  the  company,  but  a  low 
percentage  of  workers  who  changed  jobs. 

During  the  postwar  economic  reconstruction,  the  backbone  of 
the  labor  force  was,  of  course,  made  up  of  people  born  before  World 
War  II.  These  people  grew  up  in  a  Japan  that  was  still  largely  an 
agriculturally  based  economy  and  had  little  material  wealth. 
Moreover,  they  suffered  the  hardships  of  war  and  accepted  hard 
work  as  a  part  of  their  lives.  In  the  late  twentieth  century,  these 
people  were  being  replaced  by  generations  born  after  the  war,  and 
there  were  indications  that  the  newcomers  had  different  atti- 
tudes toward  work.  Postwar  generations  were  accustomed  to 
prosperity,  and  they  were  also  much  better  educated  than  their 
elders. 

As  might  be  expected,  these  socioeconomic  changes  have  affected 
workers'  attitudes.  Prior  to  World  War  II,  surveys  indicated  that 
the  aspect  of  life  regarded  as  most  worthwhile  was  work.  During 
the  1980s,  the  percentage  of  people  who  felt  this  way  was  declin- 
ing. Workers'  identification  with  their  employers  was  weakening 
as  well.  A  survey  by  the  Management  and  Coordination  Agency 
revealed  that  a  record  2.7  million  workers  changed  jobs  in  the  one- 
year  period  beginning  October  1 ,  1986,  and  the  ratio  of  those  who 


222 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

switched  jobs  to  the  total  labor  force  matched  the  previous  high 
recorded  in  1974.  This  survey  also  showed  that  the  percentage  of 
workers  indicating  an  interest  in  changing  jobs  increased  from  4.5 
percent  in  1971  to  9.9  percent  in  1987. 

Another  indication  of  changing  worker  attitudes  was  the  num- 
ber of  people  meeting  with  corporate  scouts  to  discuss  the  possibil- 
ity of  switching  jobs.  Corporations'  treatment  of  older  workers  also 
affected  attitudes:  there  were  fewer  positions  for  older  workers,  and 
many  found  themselves  without  the  rewards  that  their  predeces- 
sors had  enjoyed. 

Aging  and  Retirement  of  the  Labor  Force 

Japan's  population  was  aging  in  the  late  twentieth  century.  Dur- 
ing the  1950s,  the  percentage  of  the  population  in  the  sixty-five- 
and-over  group  remained  steady  at  around  5  percent.  Through- 
out subsequent  decades,  however,  that  age-group  expanded,  and 
by  1987  it  had  grown  to  almost  11  percent  of  the  population.  It 
was  expected  to  have  reached  16  percent  by  2000  and  almost  24 
percent  by  2020  (see  Population,  ch.  2).  Perhaps  the  most  outstand- 
ing feature  of  this  trend  was  the  speed  with  which  it  was  occurring 
in  comparison  to  trends  in  other  industrialized  nations.  In  the 
United  States,  expansion  of  the  sixty-five-and-over  age-group  from 
7  percent  to  14  percent  took  seventy-five  years;  in  Britain  and  the 
Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany)  this  expansion  took 
forty-five  years.  The  same  expansion  in  Japan  was  expected  to  take 
only  twenty- six  years. 

As  Japan's  population  aged,  so  did  its  work  force.  In  1988  the 
Ministry  of  Labor  projected  that,  by  1990,  20  percent  of  the  work 
force  would  be  made  up  of  workers  aged  fifty-five  and  over.  By 
2000,  the  ministry  predicted,  24  percent  of  the  working  popula- 
tion (almost  one  in  four  workers)  would  be  in  this  age-group.  This 
demographic  shift  was  expected  to  bring  about  both  macroeconomic 
and  microeconomic  problems.  At  the  national  level,  Japan  may 
have  trouble  in  financing  the  pension  system.  At  the  corporate  level, 
problems  will  include  growing  personnel  costs  and  the  shortage  of 
senior  positions.  If  such  problems  become  severe,  government  will 
be  forced  to  develop  countermeasures. 

In  most  Japanese  companies,  salaries  rose  with  worker  age.  Be- 
cause younger  workers  were  paid  less,  they  were  more  attractive 
to  employers,  and  the  difficulty  in  finding  employment  increased 
with  age.  This  pattern  was  evidenced  by  the  unemployment  rates 
for  different  age-groups  and  by  the  number  of  applicants  per  job 
vacancy  for  each  age- group  in  openings  handled  by  public  employ- 
ment offices.  As  the  Japanese  population  ages,  such  trends  may  grow. 


223 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


Most  Japanese  companies  required  that  employees  retire  upon 
reaching  a  specified  age.  During  most  of  the  postwar  period,  that 
age  was  fifty-five.  Since  government  social  security  payments  nor- 
mally began  at  age  sixty,  workers  were  forced  to  find  reemploy- 
ment to  fill  the  five-year  gap.  However,  in  1986  the  Diet  passed 
the  Law  Concerning  the  Stabilization  of  Employment  for  Elderly 
People,  to  provide  various  incentives  for  firms  to  raise  their  retire- 
ment age  to  sixty.  Many  Japanese  companies  raised  the  retirement 
age  they  set,  partly  in  response  to  this  legislation.  And  despite  man- 
datory retirement  policies,  many  Japanese  companies  allowed  their 
employees  to  continue  working  beyond  the  age  of  sixty — although 
generally  at  reduced  wages.  Reasons  that  people  over  sixty  con- 
tinued to  work  varied:  some  did  so  to  supplement  inadequate  pen- 
sion incomes,  while  others  simply  wanted  to  give  meaning  to  their 
lives  or  to  keep  in  touch  with  society  (see  table  17,  Appendix). 

As  Japan's  population  aged,  the  financial  health  of  the  public 
pension  plan  deteriorated.  To  avoid  massive  premium  increases, 
government  reformed  the  system  in  1986  by  cutting  benefit  levels 
and  raising  the  plan's  specified  age  at  which  benefits  began  from 
sixty  to  sixty- five.  Under  the  revised  system,  contributions  paid 
in  equal  share  by  employer  and  employee  were  expected  to  be 
equivalent  to  about  30  percent  of  wages,  as  opposed  to  40  percent 
of  wages  under  the  old  system.  However,  problems  now  arose  in 
securing  employment  opportunities  for  the  sixty- to- sixty-five  age- 
group. 

In  1990,  some  90  percent  of  companies  paid  retirement  benefits 
to  their  employees  in  the  form  of  lump-sum  payments  and  pen- 
sions. Some  companies  based  the  payment  amount  on  the  em- 
ployee's base  pay,  while  others  used  formulas  independent  of  base 
pay.  Since  the  system  was  designed  to  reward  long  service,  pay- 
ment rose  progressively  with  the  number  of  years  worked. 

Social  Insurance  and  Minimum  Wage  Systems 

Companies  in  Japan  were  responsible  for  enrolling  their  employees 
in  various  social  insurance  systems,  including  health  insurance,  em- 
ployee pension  insurance,  employment  insurance,  and  workers'  ac- 
cident compensation  insurance.  The  employer  covered  all  costs  for 
workers'  accident  compensation  insurance,  but  payments  to  the  other 
systems  were  shared  by  both  employer  and  employee. 

The  Minimum  Wage  Law,  introduced  in  1947  but  not  enacted 
until  1959,  was  designed  to  protect  low- income  workers.  Minimum 
wage  levels  have  been  determined,  according  to  both  region  and 
industry,  by  special  councils  composed  of  government,  labor,  and 
employment  representatives.

The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

Labor  Unions 

Japan's  over  74,500  trade  unions  were  represented  by  four  main 
labor  federations  in  the  mid-1980s:  the  General  Council  of  Trade 
Unions  of  Japan  (Nihon  Rodo  Kumiai  Sohyogikai,  commonly 
known  as  Sohyo),  with  4.4  million  members — a  substantial  per- 
centage representing  public  sector  employees;  the  Japan  Confeder- 
ation of  Labor  (Zen  Nihon  Rodo  Sodomei,  or  Domei  for  short), 
with  2.2  million  members;  the  Federation  of  Independent  Labor 
Unions  (Churitsu  Roren),  with  1.6  million  members;  and  the  Na- 
tional Federation  of  Industrial  Organizations  (Shinsanbetsu),  with 
only  61,000  members.  In  1987  Domei  and  Churitsu  Roren  were 
dissolved  and  amalgamated  into  the  newly  established  National  Fed- 
eration of  Private  Sector  Unions  (Rengo);  and  in  1990  Sohyo  af- 
filiates merged  with  Rengo  to  form  a  new  entity,  Shin  Rengo.  Local 
labor  unions  and  work  unit  unions,  rather  than  the  federations, 
conducted  the  major  bargaining.  Unit  unions  often  banded  together 
for  wage  negotiations,  but  federations  did  not  control  their  poli- 
cies or  actions.  Federations  also  engaged  in  political  and  public  re- 
lations activities  (see  Interest  Groups,  ch.  6). 

The  rate  of  labor  union  membership,  which  was  35.4  percent 
in  1970,  had  declined  considerably  by  the  end  of  the  1980s.  The 
continuing  long-term  reduction  in  union  membership  was  caused 
by  several  factors,  including  the  restructuring  of  Japanese  indus- 
try away  from  heavy  industries.  Many  people  entering  the  work 
force  in  the  1980s  joined  smaller  companies  in  the  tertiary  sector, 
where  there  was  a  general  disinclination  toward  joining  labor  or- 
ganizations. 

The  relationship  between  the  typical  labor  union  and  the  com- 
pany was  unusually  close.  Both  white-  and  blue-collar  workers 
joined  the  union  automatically  in  most  major  companies.  Tem- 
porary and  subcontracting  workers  were  excluded,  and  managers 
with  the  rank  of  section  chief  and  above  were  considered  part  of 
management.  In  most  corporations,  however,  many  of  the  man- 
agerial staff  were  former  union  members.  In  general,  Japanese 
unions  were  sensitive  to  the  economic  health  of  the  company,  and 
company  management  usually  briefed  the  union  membership  on 
the  state  of  corporate  affairs. 

Any  regular  employee  below  the  rank  of  section  chief  was  eligi- 
ble to  become  a  union  officer.  Management,  however,  often  pres- 
sured the  workers  to  select  favored  employees.  Officers  usually 
maintained  their  seniority  and  tenure  while  working  exclusively 
on  union  activities  and  being  paid  from  the  union's  accounts,  and 
union  offices  were  often  located  at  the  factory  site.  Many  union 


225 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

officers  went  on  to  higher  positions  within  the  corporation  if  they 
were  particularly  effective  (or  troublesome),  but  few  became  ac- 
tive in  organized  labor  activities  at  the  national  level. 

During  prosperous  times,  the  spring  labor  offensives  were  highly 
ritualized  affairs,  with  banners,  sloganeering,  and  dances  aimed 
more  at  being  a  show  of  force  than  a  crippling  job  action.  Mean- 
while, serious  discussions  took  place  between  the  union  officers  and 
corporate  managers  to  determine  pay  and  benefit  adjustments.  If 
the  economy  turned  sour,  or  if  management  tried  to  reduce  the 
number  of  permanent  employees,  however,  disruptive  strikes  often 
occurred.  The  number  of  working  days  lost  to  labor  disputes  peaked 
in  the  economic  turmoil  of  1974  and  1975  at  around  9  million  work- 
days in  the  two-year  period.  In  1979,  however,  there  were  fewer 
than  1  million  days  lost.  Since  1981  the  average  number  of  days 
lost  per  worker  each  year  to  disputes  was  just  over  9  percent  of 
the  number  lost  in  the  United  States  (see  table  18,  Appendix).  After 
1975,  when  the  economy  entered  a  period  of  slower  growth,  an- 
nual wage  increases  moderated,  and  labor  relations  were  concilia- 
tory. During  the  1980s,  workers  received  pay  hikes  that  on  average 
closely  reflected  the  real  growth  of  GNP  for  the  preceding  year. 
In  1989,  for  example,  workers  received  an  average  5.1  percent  pay 
hike,  while  GNP  growth  had  averaged  5  percent  between  1987  and 
1989.  The  moderate  trend  continued  in  the  early  1990s,  as  the  coun- 
try's national  labor  federations  were  reorganizing  themselves. 

Infrastructure  and  Technology 

A  mountainous,  insular  nation,  Japan  has  inadequate  natural 
resources  to  support  its  growing  economy  and  large  population  (see 
Energy,  this  ch.).  Although  many  kinds  of  minerals  were  extracted 
throughout  the  country,  most  mineral  resources  had  to  be  imported 
in  the  postwar  era.  Local  deposits  of  metal-bearing  ores  were 
difficult  to  process  because  they  were  of  a  low  grade.  The  nation's 
large  and  varied  forest  resources,  which  covered  70  percent  of  the 
country  in  the  late  1980s,  were  not  utilized  extensively.  Because 
of  the  precipitous  terrain,  underdeveloped  road  network,  and  high 
percentage  of  young  trees,  domestic  sources  were  able  to  supply 
only  between  25  and  30  percent  of  the  nation's  timber  needs. 
Agriculture  and  fishing  were  the  best  developed  resources,  but  only 
through  years  of  painstaking  investment  and  toil.  The  nation  there- 
fore built  up  the  manufacturing  and  processing  industries  to  con- 
vert raw  materials  imported  from  abroad.  This  strategy  of  economic 
development  necessitated  the  establishment  of  a  strong  economic 
infrastructure  to  provide  the  needed  energy,  transportation,  com- 
munications, and  technological  know-how.

The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

Construction 

The  mainstay  of  infrastructure  development  was  the  construc- 
tion industry,  which  employed  slightly  less  than  10  percent  of  the 
labor  force  in  1985  and  contributed  some  8.5  percent  of  GDP.  After 
the  two  oil  crises  in  the  1970s,  construction  investment  turned  slug- 
gish and  the  share  of  construction  investment  in  GNP  decreased 
gradually.  In  1987,  however,  business  expanded  through  inves- 
tors' confidence,  continued  increase  in  corporate  earnings,  improve- 
ment of  personal  income,  and  rapid  rise  in  land  prices.  The  share 
of  construction  investment  in  GNP  rose  sharply,  especially  for  more 
sophisticated  and  higher  value-added  private  housing  and  private 
nonhousing  structures. 

Construction  starts  in  FY  1988  covered  a  total  area  of  258  mil- 
lion square  meters,  the  second  highest  area  on  record,  while  hous- 
ing starts  numbered  1.66  million,  the  third  highest  on  record.  Total 
investment  in  construction  exceeded  US$483  billion.  Growing  de- 
mand for  private  housing  and  new  industry  plants  and  equipment 
led  to  Japan's  fifty  largest  construction  companies  experiencing 
double-digit  growth  in  FY  1988. 

Although  demand  for  new  private  housing  was  expected  to  grow 
in  the  early  1990s,  even  greater  growth  was  expected  for  new  urban 
office  buildings.  A  number  of  large  urban  development  projects, 
including  those  for  Tokyo's  waterfront,  other  urban  redevelopment, 
highway  construction,  and  new  or  expanded  airports,  suggested 
continued  work  for  the  construction  industry  through  the  1990s. 

Japan's  construction  technology,  which  includes  advanced  earth- 
quake-resistant designs,  was  among  the  most  developed  in  the  world 
(see  Visual  Arts,  ch.  3).  Major  firms  competed  to  improve  quality 
control  over  all  phases  of  design,  management,  and  execution. 
Research  and  development  focused  especially  on  energy-related  fa- 
cilities, such  as  nuclear  power  plants  and  liquid  natural  gas  (LNG) 
storage  tanks.  The  largest  firms  were  also  improving  their  under- 
water construction  methods. 

Mining 

Mining  was  a  rapidly  declining  industry  in  the  1980s.  Domestic 
coal  production  shrank  from  a  peak  of  55  million  tons  in  1960  to 
slightly  more  than  16  million  tons  in  1985,  while  coal  imports  grew 
to  nearly  91  million  tons  in  1987.  Domestic  coal  mining  compa- 
nies faced  cheap  coal  imports  and  high  production  costs,  which 
caused  them  chronic  deficits  in  the  1980s.  In  the  late  1980s,  Japan's 
approximately  1  million  tons  of  coal  reserves  were  mostly  hard  coal 


227 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

used  for  coking.  Most  of  the  coal  Japan  consumed  was  used  to 
produce  electric  power. 

Japanese  coal  is  found  at  the  extreme  ends  of  the  country,  in 
Hokkaido  and  Kyushu,  which  have,  respectively,  45  and  40  per- 
cent of  the  country's  coal  deposits.  Kyushu's  coal  is  generally  of 
poor  quality  and  hard  to  extract,  but  the  proximity  of  the  Kyushu 
mines  to  ports  facilitates  transportation.  In  Hokkaido,  the  coal 
seams  are  wider  and  can  be  worked  mechanically,  and  the  quality 
of  the  coal  is  good.  Unfortunately,  these  mines  are  located  well 
inland,  making  transportation  difficult.  In  most  Japanese  coal 
mines,  inclined  galleries,  which  extended  in  some  places  to  9.7 
kilometers  underground,  were  used  instead  of  pits.  This  arrange- 
ment was  costly,  despite  the  installation  of  moving  platforms.  The 
result  was  that  a  miner's  daily  output  was  far  less  than  in  Western 
Europe  and  the  United  States  and  domestic  coal  cost  far  more  than 
imported  coal. 

Energy 

Japan  lacks  any  significant  domestic  sources  of  energy  except 
coal  and  must  import  substantial  amounts  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas, 
and  other  energy  resources,  including  uranium.  In  1986  the  coun- 
try's dependence  on  imports  for  primary  energy  stood  at  nearly 
92  percent.  Its  rapid  industrial  growth  since  the  end  of  World  War 
II  had  doubled  energy  consumption  every  five  years.  The  use  of 
power  had  also  changed  qualitatively.  In  1950,  coal  supplied  half 
of  Japan's  energy  needs,  hydroelectricity  one-third,  and  oil  the  rest. 
In  1987  oil  provided  Japan  with  56.6  percent  of  energy  needs.  Coal 
provided  18  percent  of  energy  needs,  natural  gas  9.7  percent, 
nuclear  power  10  percent,  hydroelectic  power  4.1  percent,  geother- 
mal  0.1  percent,  and  1.5  percent  came  from  other  sources.  Dur- 
ing the  1960-72  period  of  accelerated  growth,  energy  consumption 
grew  much  faster  than  GNP,  doubling  Japan's  consumption  of 
world  energy.  By  1976,  with  only  3  percent  of  the  world's  popula- 
tion, Japan  was  consuming  6  percent  of  global  energy  supplies. 

After  the  two  oil  crises  of  the  1970s,  the  pattern  of  energy  con- 
sumption in  Japan  changed  from  heavy  dependence  on  oil  to  some 
diversification  to  other  forms  of  energy  resources.  Japan's  domes- 
tic oil  consumption  dropped  slightly,  from  around  5.1  million  barrels 
of  oil  per  day  in  the  late  1970s  to  4.9  million  barrels  per  day  in 
1990.  While  the  country's  use  of  oil  was  declining,  its  consump- 
tion of  nuclear  power  and  LNG  rose  substantially.  Because  domestic 
natural  gas  production  is  minimal,  rising  demand  was  met  by 
greater  imports.  Japan's  main  LNG  suppliers  in  1987  were  Indone- 
sia (51.3  percent),  Malaysia  (20.4  percent),  Brunei  (17.8  percent), 


228 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

Abu  Dhabi  (7.3  percent),  and  the  United  States  (3.2  percent). 
Several  Japanese  industries,  including  electric  power  companies 
and  steelmakers,  switched  from  petroleum  to  coal,  most  of  which 
was  imported. 

In  1987,  the  latest  year  for  which  complete  statistics  were  avail- 
able, Japan's  total  energy  requirements  were  tabulated  at  372  mil- 
lion tons  of  petroleum  equivalent.  Of  this  total,  85  percent  was 
imported.  Consumption  totalled  263.8  million  tons,  45.9  percent 
of  which  was  used  by  industry;  23.6  percent  by  the  transportation 
sector;  26.8  percent  for  agricultural,  residential,  services,  and  other 
uses;  and  3.7  percent  for  non-energy  uses,  such  as  lubricating  oil 
or  asphalt. 

In  1989  Japan  was  the  world's  third  largest  producer  of  electric- 
ity. Most  of  the  more  than  3,300  power  plants  were  thermoelec- 
tric. About  75  percent  of  the  available  power  was  controlled  by 
the  ten  major  regional  power  utilities,  of  which  Tokyo  Electric 
Power  Company  was  the  world's  largest.  Electricity  rates  in  Japan 
were  among  the  world's  highest. 

The  Japanese  were  working  to  increase  the  availability  of  nuclear 
power  in  1985.  Although  Japan  was  a  late  starter  in  this  field,  it 
finally  imported  technology  from  the  United  States  and  obtained 
uranium  from  Canada,  France,  South  Africa,  and  Australia.  By 
1987  the  country  had  thirty-three  nuclear  reactors  in  operation, 
with  seventeen  additional  reactors  planned  or  under  construction. 
The  ratio  of  nuclear  power  generation  to  total  electricity  produc- 
tion increased  from  2  percent  in  1973  to  26  percent  in  1987. 

During  the  1980s,  Japan's  nuclear  power  program  was  strongly 
opposed  by  environmental  groups,  particularly  after  the  Three  Mile 
Island  accident  in  the  United  States.  Other  problems  for  the  pro- 
gram were  the  rising  costs  of  nuclear  reactors  and  fuel,  the  huge 
investments  necessary  for  fuel  enrichment  and  reprocessing  plants, 
reactor  failures,  and  nuclear  waste  disposal.  Nevertheless,  Japan 
continued  to  build  nuclear  power  plants.  Of  alternative  energy 
sources,  Japan  has  effectively  exploited  only  geothermal  energy. 
The  country  had  six  geothermal  power  stations  with  a  combined 
capacity  of  133,000  kilowatts  per  hour  in  1989  (see  table  19,  Ap- 
pendix). 

Research  and  Development 

As  its  economy  matured  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  Japan  gradu- 
ally shifted  away  from  dependence  on  foreign  research.  Japan's 
ability  to  conduct  independent  research  and  development  became 
a  decisive  factor  in  boosting  the  nation's  competitiveness.  As  early 
as  1980,  the  Science  and  Technology  Agency,  a  component  of  the 


229 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  announced  the  commencement  of 
"the  era  of  Japan's  technological  independence."  By  1986  Japan 
had  come  to  devote  a  higher  proportion  of  its  GNP  to  research  and 
development  than  the  United  States.  In  1989  nearly  700,000 
Japanese  were  engaged  in  research  and  development,  more  than 
the  number  of  French,  Britons,  and  West  Germans  combined.  At 
the  same  time  Japan  was  producing  more  engineers  than  any  coun- 
try except  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States.  Similar  trends 
were  seen  in  the  use  of  capital  resources.  Japan  spent  US$39. 1  bil- 
lion on  government  and  private  research  and  development  in  1987, 
equivalent  to  2.9  percent  of  its  national  income  (the  highest  ratio 
in  the  world).  Although  the  United  States  spent  around  US$108.2 
billion  on  research  and  development  in  1987,  only  2.6  percent  of 
its  income  was  devoted  to  that  purpose,  ranking  it  third  behind 
Japan  and  West  Germany. 

The  Japanese  reputation  for  originality  also  increased.  Of  the 
1.2  million  patents  registered  worldwide  in  1985,  40  percent  were 
Japanese,  and  Japanese  citizens  took  out  19  percent  of  the  120,000 
patent  applications  made  in  the  United  States.  In  1987,  around 
33  percent  of  computer-related  patents  in  the  United  States  were 
Japanese,  as  were  30  percent  of  aviation-related  and  26  percent 
of  communications  patents. 

Despite  its  advances  in  technological  research  and  development 
and  its  major  commitment  to  applied  research,  however,  Japan 
significantly  trailed  other  industrialized  nations  in  basic  scientific 
research.  In  1989  around  13  percent  of  Japanese  research  and  de- 
velopment funds  were  devoted  to  basic  research.  The  proportion 
of  basic  research  expenses  borne  by  government  was  also  much 
lower  in  Japan  than  in  the  United  States,  as  was  Japan's  ratio  of 
basic  research  expenses  to  GNP.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  Japanese 
government  attempted  to  rectify  national  deficiencies  in  basic 
research  through  a  broad  "originality"  campaign  in  schools,  gener- 
ously funding  research,  and  encouraging  private  cooperation  in 
various  fields. 

Most  research  and  development  was  private,  although  govern- 
ment support  to  universities  and  laboratories  aided  industry  gready. 
In  1986,  private  industry  provided  76  percent  of  the  funding  for 
research  and  development,  which  was  especially  strong  in  the  late 
1980s  in  electrical  machinery  (with  a  ratio  of  research  costs  to  total 
sales  of  5.5  percent  in  1986),  precision  instruments  (4.6  percent), 
chemicals  (4.3  percent),  and  transportation  equipment  (3.2  per- 
cent). 

As  for  government  research  and  development,  the  national  com- 
mitment to  greater  defense  spending  in  the  1980s  translated  into 


230 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

increased  defense-related  research  and  development.  Meanwhile, 
government  moved  away  from  supporting  large-scale  industrial 
technology,  such  as  shipbuilding  and  steel.  Research  emphases  in 
the  1980s  were  in  alternative  energy,  information  processing,  life 
sciences,  and  modern  industrial  materials. 

Industry 

The  nation's  industrial  activities  (including  mining,  manufac- 
turing, and  power,  gas,  and  water  utilities)  contributed  46.6  of  total 
domestic  industrial  production  in  1989,  up  slightly  from  45.8  per- 
cent in  1975.  This  steady  performance  of  the  industrial  sector  in 
the  1970s  and  1980s  was  a  result  of  the  growth  of  high- technology 
industries  (see  table  20,  Appendix).  During  this  period,  some  of 
the  older  heavy  industries,  such  as  steel  and  shipbuilding,  either 
declined  or  simply  held  stable.  Together  with  the  construction  in- 
dustry, those  older  heavy  industries  employed  34.9  of  the  work  force 
in  1989  (relatively  unchanged  from  34.8  percent  in  1980).  The  ser- 
vice industry  sector  grew  the  fastest  in  the  1980s  in  terms  of  GNP, 
while  the  greatest  losses  occurred  in  agriculture,  forestry,  mining, 
and  transportation.  Most  industry  catered  to  the  domestic  mar- 
ket, but  exports  were  important  for  several  key  commodities.  In 
general,  industries  relatively  geared  toward  exports  over  imports 
in  1988  were  transportation  equipment  (with  a  24.8  percent  ratio 
of  exports  over  imports),  motor  vehicles  (54  percent),  electrical 
machinery  (23.4  percent),  general  machinery  (21.2  percent),  and 
metal  and  metal  products  (8.2  percent). 

Industry  was  concentrated  in  several  regions,  which  were  in  order 
of  importance:  the  Kanto  region  surrounding  Tokyo,  especially 
the  prefectures  of  Chiba,  Kanagawa,  Saitama,  and  Tokyo  (the 
Keihin  industrial  region);  the  Nagoya  metropolitan  area,  includ- 
ing Aichi,  Gifu,  Mie,  and  Shizuoka  prefectures  (the  Chukyo-Tokai 
industrial  region);  Kinki  (the  Keihanshin  industrial  region);  the 
southwestern  part  of  Honshu  and  northern  Shikoku  around  the 
Inland  Sea  (the  Setouchi  industrial  region);  and  the  northern  part 
of  Kyushu  (Kitakyushu).  In  addition,  a  long  narrow  belt  of  indus- 
trial centers  was  found  between  Tokyo  and  Hiroshima,  established 
by  particular  industries,  that  had  developed  as  mill  towns.  These 
included  Toyota  City,  near  Nagoya,  the  home  of  the  automobile 
manufacturer. 

The  fields  in  which  Japan  enjoyed  relatively  high  technological 
development  included  semiconductor  manufacturing,  optical  fibers, 
optoelectronics,  video  discs  and  videotex,  facsimile  and  copy  ma- 
chines, industrial  robots,  and  fermentation  processes.  Japan  lagged 
slightly  in  such  fields  as  satellites,  rockets,  and  large  aircraft,  where 


231 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


advanced  engineering  capabilities  were  required,  and  in  such  fields 
as  computer-aided  design  and  computer-aided  manufacturing 
(CAD/CAM),  databases,  and  natural  resources  exploitation,  where 
basic  software  capabilities  were  required. 

Basic  Manufactures 

Japan's  major  export  industries  included  automobiles,  consumer 
electronics,  computers,  semiconductors,  and  iron  and  steel  (see 
Major  International  Industries,  ch.  5).  Additionally,  key  indus- 
tries in  Japan's  economy  were  mining,  nonferrous  metals,  petro- 
chemicals, pharmaceuticals,  bioindustry,  shipbuilding,  aerospace, 
textiles,  and  processed  foods. 

As  the  coal-mining  industry  declined,  so  did  the  general  impor- 
tance of  domestic  mining  in  the  whole  economy.  Only  0.2  percent 
of  the  labor  force  was  engaged  in  mining  operations  in  1988,  and 
the  value  added  from  mining  was  about  0.3  percent  of  the  total 
for  all  mining  and  manufacturing.  Domestic  production  contributed 
most  to  the  supply  of  such  nonmetals  as  silica  sand,  pyrophyllite 
clay,  dolomite,  and  limestone.  Domestic  mines  were  contributing 
declining  shares  of  the  requirements  for  the  metals  zinc,  copper, 
and  gold.  Almost  all  of  the  ores  used  in  the  nation's  sophisticated 
processing  industries  were  imported. 

The  nonferrous  metals  industry  fared  very  well  in  the  late  1980s, 
as  domestic  demand  for  these  metals  reached  record  levels.  Japan's 
consumption  of  the  main  nonferrous  metals,  such  as  copper,  lead, 
zinc,  and  aluminum,  was  the  second  highest  in  the  noncommunist 
world  after  the  United  States.  In  1989,  sales  of  copper  products 
exceeded  1.5  million  tons  for  the  first  time.  Production  of  electric 
wire  and  cable,  which  accounted  for  70  percent  of  Japan's  copper 
demand,  and  brass  mills,  which  use  the  other  30  percent,  ex- 
perienced sharp  growth,  as  did  the  demand  for  aluminum. 

The  petrochemical  industry  experienced  moderate  growth  in  the 
late  1980s  because  of  steady  economic  expansion.  The  highest 
growth  came  in  the  production  of  plastics,  polystyrene,  and  poly- 
propylene. Prices  for  petrochemicals  remained  high  because  of  in- 
creased demand  in  the  newly  developing  economies  of  Asia,  but 
the  construction  of  factory  complexes  to  make  ethylene-based 
products  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea)  and  Thailand 
by  1990  was  expected  to  increase  supplies  and  reduce  prices.  In 
the  long  term,  the  Japanese  petrochemical  industry  was  likely  to 
face  intensifying  competition  due  to  the  integration  of  domestic  and 
international  markets,  and  efforts  by  other  Asian  countries  to  catch 
up  with  Japan.

The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

The  pharmaceutical  industry  and  bioindustry  experienced  strong 
growth  in  the  late  1980s.  Pharmaceuticals  production  grew  an  es- 
timated 8  percent  in  1989,  because  of  increased  expenditures  by 
Japan's  rapidly  aging  population.  Leading  producers  actively  de- 
veloped new  drugs,  such  as  those  for  degenerative  and  geriatric 
diseases,  while  internationalizing  operations.  Pharmaceutical  com- 
panies were  establishing  tripolar  networks  connecting  Japan,  the 
United  States,  and  Western  Europe  to  coordinate  product  develop- 
ment. They  also  increased  merger  and  acquisition  activity  over- 
seas. Biotechnology  research  and  development  was  progressing 
steadily,  including  the  launching  of  marine  biotechnology  projects, 
with  full-scale  commercialization  expected  to  take  place  in  the  early 
1990s.  Biotechnology  research  covered  a  wide  variety  of  fields: 
agriculture,  animal  husbandry,  pharmaceuticals,  chemicals,  food 
processing,  and  fermentation.  Human  hormones  and  proteins  for 
pharmaceutical  products  were  sought  through  genetic  recombina- 
tion using  bacteria.  Biotechnology  also  was  used  to  enhance  bac- 
terial enzyme  properties  to  further  improve  amino-acid  fermentation 
technology,  a  field  in  which  Japan  was  the  world  leader.  The  gov- 
ernment cautioned  Japanese  producers,  however,  against  over- 
optimism  regarding  biotechnology  and  bioindustry.  The  research 
race  both  in  Japan  and  abroad  intensified  in  the  1980s,  leading 
to  patent  disputes  and  forcing  some  companies  to  abandon  research. 
Also,  researchers  began  to  realize  that  such  drug  development  con- 
tinually showed  new  complexities,  requiring  more  technical  break- 
throughs than  first  imagined.  Yet  despite  these  problems,  research 
and  development,  especially  in  leading  companies,  were  still  ex- 
pected to  be  successful  and  end  in  product  commercialization  in 
the  mid-term. 

Japan  dominated  world  shipbuilding  in  the  late  1980s,  filling 
more  than  half  of  all  orders  worldwide.  Its  closest  competitors  were 
South  Korea  and  Spain,  with  9  percent  and  5.2  percent  of  the  mar- 
ket, respectively.  Japan's  shipyards  replaced  their  West  European 
competitors  as  world  leaders  in  production,  through  advanced  de- 
sign, fast  delivery,  and  low  production  costs.  The  Japanese  ship- 
building industry  was  hit  by  a  lengthy  recession  from  the  late  1970s 
through  most  of  the  1980s,  which  resulted  in  a  drastic  cutback  in 
the  use  of  facilities  and  in  the  work  force,  but  there  was  a  sharp 
revival  in  1989.  The  industry  was  helped  by  a  sudden  rise  in  de- 
mand from  other  countries  that  needed  to  replace  their  aging  fleets 
and  from  a  sudden  decline  in  the  South  Korean  shipping  indus- 
try. In  1988  Japanese  shipbuilding  firms  received  orders  for  4.8 
million  gross  tons  of  ships,  but  this  figure  grew  to  7.1  million  tons 
in  1989.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

The  aerospace  industry  received  a  major  boost  in  1969  with  the 
establishment  of  the  National  Space  Development  Agency,  which 
was  charged  with  the  development  of  satellites  and  launch  vehi- 
cles (see  Telecommunications,  this  ch.).  Japan's  aircraft  industry 
was  only  one-twentieth  the  size  of  that  of  the  United  States  and 
one-twelfth  that  of  Western  Europe,  and  its  technological  level 
lagged  as  well.  However,  in  the  late  1980s  Japan  began  to  partici- 
pate in  new  international  aircraft  development  projects  as  its  tech- 
nical capabilities  developed.  The  Asuka  fanjet-powered  short  takeoff 
and  landing  (STOL)  aircraft  made  a  successful  test  flight  in  1985. 
In  1988  Japan  signed  an  accord  with  the  United  States  to  cooper- 
ate in  building  Japan's  next- generation  fighter  aircraft,  the  FSX 
(see  Defense  Industry,  ch.  8). 

The  textile  industry  showed  a  strong  revival  in  the  late  1980s 
because  of  increased  domestic  demand  from  the  construction,  au- 
tomobile, housing,  and  civil  engineering  industries  for  various  syn- 
thetic fibers.  The  clothing  industry  also  fared  well  in  the  late  1980s, 
thanks  to  the  expansion  of  consumer  demand,  especially  in  the  area 
of  women's  apparel.  Production  of  high  value-added  fashionable 
clothes  became  the  mainstay  of  this  industry. 

The  production  value  of  the  food  industry  ranked  third  among 
manufacturing  industries  after  electric  and  transport  machinery. 
It  produced  a  great  variety  of  products,  ranging  from  traditional 
Japanese  items,  such  as  soybean  paste  (miso)  and  soy  sauce,  to 
beer  and  meat.  The  industry  as  a  whole  experienced  mild  growth 
in  the  1980s,  primarily  from  the  development  of  such  new  products 
as  "dry  beer"  and  precooked  food,  which  was  increasingly  used 
because  of  the  tendency  of  family  members  to  dine  separately,  the 
trend  toward  smaller  families,  and  convenience.  A  common  fea- 
ture of  all  sectors  of  the  food  industry  was  their  internationaliza- 
tion. As  domestic  raw  materials  lost  their  price  competitiveness 
following  the  liberalization  of  imports,  food  makers  more  often 
produced  foodstuffs  overseas,  promoted  tie-ups  with  overseas  firms, 
and  purchased  overseas  firms. 

Domestic  Trade  and  Services 

The  nation's  service  industries  were  the  major  contributor  to 
GNP  and  employment,  generating  about  58  percent  of  the  national 
totals  in  1987.  Moreover,  services  were  the  fastest  growing  sector, 
outperforming  manufacturing  in  the  1980s.  The  service  sector  cov- 
ered many  diverse  activities.  Wholesale  and  retail  trade  was 
dominant,  but  advertising,  data  processing,  publishing,  tourism, 
leisure  industries,  entertainment,  and  other  industries  grew  rapidly 
in  the  1980s.  Most  service  industries  were  small  and  labor-intensive, 


234 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

but  became  more  technologically  sophisticated  as  computer  and 
electronic  products  were  incorporated  by  management. 

The  operation  of  wholesale  and  retail  trades  has  often  been 
denigrated  by  other  nations  as  a  barrier  to  foreign  participation 
in  the  Japanese  market,  as  well  as  being  called  antiquated  and  in- 
efficient. Small  retailers  and  "mom-and-pop"  stores  predominated. 
In  1985  there  were  1 .6  million  retail  outlets  in  Japan,  slightly  more 
than  the  total  number  of  retail  outlets  in  the  United  States  (1.5 
million  in  1982),  even  though  Japan  has  only  half  the  population 
of  the  United  States  and  is  smaller  than  California. 

There  were  several  changes  in  wholesaling  and  retailing  in  the 
1980s.  Japan's  distribution  system  was  becoming  more  efficient. 
Retail  outlets  and  wholesale  establishments  both  peaked  in  num- 
ber in  1982  and  were  down  5.4  percent  and  3.7  percent,  respec- 
tively, in  1985.  The  main  casualties  were  sole  proprietorships, 
especially  mom-and-pop  stores  and  wholesale  locations  with  fewer 
than  ten  employees.  Almost  96,000  of  the  1,036,000  mom-and- 
pop  stores  in  operation  in  1982  were  out  of  business  three  years 
later.  Government  estimates  for  the  late  1980s  show  additional  con- 
solidation in  both  wholesale  and  retail  sectors,  including  a  continued 
sharp  decline  in  mom-and-pop  store  operations.  A  further  decline 
in  mom-and-pop  stores  was  expected  as  a  result  of  the  Large-Scale 
Retail  Store  Law  of  1990,  which  greatly  reduced  the  power  of  small 
retailers  to  block  the  establishment  of  large  retail  stores.  Soaring 
land  prices  were  a  major  cause  of  the  decline  of  mom-and-pop 
stores,  but  an  even  more  important  reason  was  the  growth  of  con- 
venience and  discount  stores.  Discount  stores  were  not  much  big- 
ger than  the  traditional  small  shops,  but  their  distribution  networks 
gave  them  a  big  pricing  edge.  Moreover,  Japanese  consumers  were 
discovering  the  advantages  of  catalog  shopping,  which  offered  not 
only  convenience,  but  also  greater  selection  and  lower  prices.  Ac- 
cording to  a  Nikkei  survey,  the  mail-order  business  expanded  13 
percent  between  April  1987  and  March  1988  to  more  than  US$8.9 
billion  in  annual  sales.  Specialty  chains,  particularly  those  handling 
men's  and  women's  clothing,  shoes,  and  consumer  electronics,  were 
also  doing  better  than  the  overall  industry.  Department  stores,  su- 
permarkets, and  superstores  (hybrid  supermarket-discount  stores) 
and  other  big  retail  operations  were  gaining  business  at  the  expense 
of  small  retailers,  although  their  progress  was  quite  slow.  Between 
1980  and  1988,  department  stores  increased  their  share  of  total  retail 
sales  by  only  1  percentage  point  to  8.4  percent.  Supermarkets  and 
superstores  increased  in  market  share  from  6.5  to  7.3  percent.  Be- 
tween 1980  and  1988,  the  number  of  department  stores  grew  from 


235 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


325  to  just  371,  and  other  big  self-service  stores  only  increased  in 
number  by  62  units  between  1984  and  1988. 

Among  service  industries,  the  restaurant,  advertising,  real  es- 
tate, hotel  and  leisure  business,  and  data-processing  industries  grew 
rapidly  in  the  1980s.  The  fast-food  industry  has  been  profitable 
for  both  foreign  and  domestic  companies.  By  1989  family  restau- 
rants and  fast-food  chains  had  grown  into  a  US$138  billion  busi- 
ness. Overall  growth  declined  in  the  late  1980s  because  of  the  sharp 
rise  of  rents  and  a  proliferation  of  restaurants  in  many  areas.  The 
number  of  hotel  and  guest  rooms  grew  from  189,654  in  1981  to 
342,695  in  1988. 

Because  much  of  the  sales  competition  in  Japan  was  of  the  non- 
price  variety,  advertising  was  extremely  important.  Consumers  had 
to  see  the  suitability  of  products  and  services  for  their  lifestyles. 
The  intense  competition  for  the  domestic  market  spurred  the  growth 
of  the  world's  largest  advertising  agency,  Dentsu,  as  well  as  other 
advertisers. 

Transportation  and  Communications 
Railroads  and  Subways 

Railroads  were  long  the  most  important  means  of  passenger  and 
freight  transportation,  ever  since  they  were  established  in  the  late 
nineteenth  century,  but  from  the  1960s  they  were  rivalled  in  usage 
by  road  transportation  (see  Roads,  this  ch.;  table  21,  Appendix). 
The  relative  share  of  railroads  in  total  passenger-kilometers  fell  from 
66.7  percent  in  1965  to  42  percent  in  1978,  and  to  37.1  percent 
in  1987.  By  contrast,  passenger  cars  and  domestic  airlines  were 
carrying  ever-larger  shares  of  the  passenger  traffic  in  the  late  1980s 
(see  Civil  Aviation,  this  ch.;  table  22,  Appendix). 

At  the  heart  of  Japan's  railroad  system  is  the  Japan  Railways 
Group,  a  government- subsidized  group  of  eight  companies  that  took 
over  most  of  the  assets,  operations,  and  liabilities  of  the  government- 
owned  Japanese  National  Railways  in  1987.  Initially,  the  compa- 
nies remained  in  the  public  domain  with  privatization  planned,  at 
least  for  some  of  the  companies,  by  the  early  1990s.  There  were 
six  passenger  companies:  the  East  Japan,  West  Japan,  and  Central 
Japan  railway  companies,  which  operated  in  Honshu,  and  the 
Kyushu,  Shikoku,  and  Hokkaido  railway  companies,  which  oper- 
ated on  the  islands  for  which  the  companies  were  named.  In  addi- 
tion, the  East  Japan  Railway  Company,  since  the  opening  of  the 
Seikan  Tunnel  between  Honshu  and  Hokkaido  in  1988,  also  pro- 
vided express  service  to  Sapporo.  Similarly,  the  Central  Japan  Rail- 
way Company  started  serving  Shikoku  after  the  1990  completion

of  the  Seto-Ohashi  bridges,  a  system  of  seven  bridges  linking  Honshu 
and  Shikoku.  The  six  companies  had  18,800  kilometers  of  routes 
(mosdy  1.1-meter  track)  in  use  in  the  late  1980s.  About  25  percent 
of  the  routes  were  in  double-track  and  multi- track  sections,  and  the 
rest  were  single-track.  In  1988,  51  percent  of  the  six  companies' 
1,000  locomotives  were  diesel  and  the  rest  were  electric.  Another 
company,  Japan  Freight  Railway  Company,  owned  its  locomotives 
(295  diesel  and  569  electric  locomotives  in  1988),  rolling  stock,  and 
stations  but  hired  track  from  the  six  passenger  companies.  It  ran 
fewer  trains  on  less  track  than  Japanese  National  Railways  freight 
service  did  before  its  demise  but  at  increased  revenues  and  higher 
productivity.  The  eighth  company,  the  Shinkansen  Property  Cor- 
poration, leased  Shinkansen  ("bullet"  train)  railroad  facilities — 
including  2,100  kilometers  of  1.4-meter  gauge  high-speed  track — to 
the  passenger  companies  on  Honshu.  Some  of  the  Shinkansen 
electric-powered  trains  operated  at  speeds  up  to  240  kilometers  per 
hour. 

Another  nearly  3,400  kilometers  of  routes,  mostly  1.1 -meter- 
gauge,  were  operated  by  major  private  railroads,  and  by  what  are 
known  in  Japan  as  third  sector  railroads — new  companies,  financed 
with  private  and  local  government  funds — that  absorbed  some  of 
Japanese  National  Railways'  rural  lines.  There  were  twenty-seven 
private  and  third  sector  companies  in  1989. 

What  remained  of  the  debt-ridden  Japanese  National  Railways 
after  its  1987  breakup  was  named  the  Japanese  National  Railways 
Setdement  Corporation.  Its  purpose  was  to  dispose  of  assets  not  ab- 
sorbed by  the  successor  companies  and  to  execute  other  activities 
relating  to  the  breakup,  such  as  reemployment  of  former  person- 
nel. The  demise  of  the  government-owned  system  came  after  charges 
of  serious  management  inefficiencies,  profit  losses,  and  fraud.  By 
the  early  1980s,  passenger  and  freight  business  had  declined,  and 
fare  increases  failed  to  keep  up  with  higher  labor  costs.  The  new 
companies  introduced  competition,  cut  their  staffing,  and  made  re- 
form efforts.  Initial  public  reaction  to  these  moves  was  good:  the 
combined  passenger  travel  on  the  Japan  Railways  Group  passenger 
companies  in  1987  was  204.7  billion  passenger-kilometers,  up  3.2 
percent  from  1986,  while  the  passenger  sector  previously  had  been 
stagnant  since  1975.  The  growth  in  passenger  transport  of  private 
railroads  in  1987  was  2.6  percent,  which  meant  that  the  Japan  Rail- 
ways Group's  rate  of  increase  was  above  that  of  the  private-sector 
railroads  for  the  first  time  since  1974.  Demand  for  rail  transport 
was  improved,  although  it  still  accounted  for  only  37  percent  of  pas- 
senger transportation  and  only  5  percent  of  cargo  transportation  in 
1987.  Rail  passenger  transportation  was  superior  to  automobiles  in 


238 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

terms  of  energy  efficiency  and  on  speed  of  long-distance  transpor- 
tation. 

In  addition  to  its  extensive  railroads,  Japan  has  an  impressive 
number  of  subway  systems.  The  largest  was  in  Tokyo,  where  the 
subway  network  in  1989  consisted  of  21 1  kilometers  of  track  serv- 
ing 205  stations.  Two  subway  systems  served  the  capital:  one  run 
by  the  Teito  Rapid  Transit  Authority,  with  seven  lines  (the  oldest 
of  which  was  built  in  1927),  and  the  other  operated  by  the  Tokyo 
metropolitan  government's  Transportation  Bureau,  with  three  lines. 
Outlying  and  suburban  areas  were  served  by  seven  private  rail- 
road companies  whose  lines  intersected  at  major  stations  with  the 
subway  system.  More  than  sixty  additional  kilometers  of  subway 
were  under  construction  in  1990  by  the  two  companies.  As  of  1989, 
there  also  were  full  subway  systems  in  Fukuoka,  Kobe,  Kyoto, 
Nagoya,  Osaka,  Sendai,_and  Yokohama.  Hiroshima  and  Kobe  had 
light  rail  systems,  and  Osaka,  in  addition  to  its  subway,  had  an 
intermediate  capacity  transit  system  (rubber-tired  motor  cars  run- 
ning on  concrete  guideways).  Like  Tokyo,  all  of  these  cities  also 
were  well  served  by  public  and  private  railroads. 

Roads 

Road  passenger  and  freight  transport  expanded  considerably  dur- 
ing the  1980s  as  private  ownership  of  motor  vehicles  greatly  in- 
creased along  with  the  quality  and  extent  of  the  nation's  roads. 
Passenger  transport  by  motor  vehicles  in  1987  totaled  540.7  bil- 
lion passenger-kilometers,  up  8.2  percent  over  the  previous  year. 
The  Japan  Railways  Group  companies  operated  long-distance  bus 
service  in  the  late  1980s  on  the  nation's  expanding  expressway  net- 
work. In  addition  to  relatively  low  fares  and  deluxe  seating,  the 
buses  were  well  utilized  because  they  continued  service  during  the 
night  when  air  and  train  services  were  limited.  The  cargo  sector 
also  grew  rapidly  in  the  1980s,  recording  224. 1  billion  ton-kilometers 
in  1987.  The  freight  handled  by  motor  vehicles,  mainly  trucks,  in 
1989,  was  over  5  billion  tons,  accounting  for  90  percent  of  domes- 
tic freight  tonnage  and  about  50  percent  of  ton-kilometers. 

The  total  length  of  roads  in  Japan  reached  about  1 ,098,900  kilo- 
meters in  1987  (see  fig.  6).  Sixty-five  percent  of  the  roads  were 
paved,  compared  to  only  about  40  percent  in  1978.  Efforts  to  up- 
grade roads,  however,  have  not  kept  up  with  increases  in  automo- 
bile ownership.  In  the  late  1980s,  many  roads  had  reached  a 
saturation  point  and  traffic  jams  were  especially  serious  in  large 
urban  areas.  There  was  a  vigorous  government  plan  to  improve 
the  situation  by  constructing  an  additional  14,000  kilometers  of 


239 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

highways  in  the  1990s.  The  1988  opening  of  the  Seto-Ohashi  section 
of  the  Honshu-Shikoku  Bridge  project  provided  a  long-awaited 
direct  link  between  Honshu  and  relatively  undeveloped  Shikoku. 

Maritime  Transportation 

In  1986  the  Japanese  merchant  fleet  included  10,011  ships  with 
a  total  displacement  of  38.5  million  gross  tons,  a  steady  decrease 
from  10,425  ships  with  a  total  gross  tonnage  of  40.4  million  in  1984. 
Of  the  nearly  1 ,200  Japanese  ships  of  1,000  gross  registered  tons 
and  over,  there  were  more  than  300  bulk  carriers;  more  than  250 
petroleum,  oils,  and  lubricants  tankers;  some  240  vehicle  and  cargo 
carriers;  and  more  than  150  refrigerated  cargo  ships.  The  remainder 
were  passenger  and  passenger-cargo  ships,  container  ships,  roll- 
on/roll-off  cargo  ships,  chemical  tankers,  combination  ore  and  oil 
carriers,  and  other  specialized  types  of  large  ships. 

Japanese  ports,  mainly  Yokohama,  Nagoya,  and  Kobe,  received 
40,129  ships  in  1986,  loaded  88.1  million  tons  of  cargo,  and  un- 
loaded 598.9  million  tons.  Other  major  ports  included  Chiba,  Hako- 
date, Kitakyushu,  Kushiro,  Osaka,  Tokyo,  and  Yokkaichi. 

Almost  all  shipping  operated  from  coastal  ports.  Japans'  rivers 
were  short  and  were  unnavigable  except  in  the  lower  reaches. 

Civil  Aviation 

The  civil  aviation  industry  grew  steadily  during  the  1980s,  with 
increased  demand  for  both  domestic  and  international  services.  In- 
creases in  the  number  of  passengers  on  each  type  of  route  reached 
more  than  10  percent  per  year.  Direct  service  was  provided  be- 
tween the  New  Tokyo  International  Airport  at  Narita-Sanrizuka, 
seventy  kilometers  northeast  of  Tokyo,  and  nearly  every  country 
in  the  world  via  Japan  Airlines,  All  Nippon  Airways,  and  most 
other  international  carriers.  Tokyo  International  Airport  at  Haneda 
and  Osaka,  Nagoya,  Nagasaki,  Fukuoka,  Kagoshima,  and  Naha 
airports  also  handled  some  international  flights  in  the  late  1980s, 
and  the  new  Kansai  International  Airport  was  under  construction 
in  Osaka  Bay  with  a  projected  completion  date  of  1993.  Japan 
Airlines,  All  Nippon  Airways,  and  Japan  Air  System  also  provided 
connections  between  most  major  Japanese  cities,  and  South- West 
Air  Lines  operated  scheduled  flights  to  major  islands  in  the  Ryukyus. 
In  1986  Japanese  carriers  served  more  than  53.6  million  passengers. 
Although  air  cargo  accounted  for  only  for  a  small  proportion  of  all 
cargo  transported  both  domestically  and  internationally — approxi- 
mately 3.5  trillion  ton-kilometers  in  1986 — the  rate  of  air  cargo 
growth  was  very  high.

Telecommunications 

In  1990  no  other  nation  in  the  world  was  as  literate  (with  a  liter- 
acy rate  of  99  percent)  and  dominated  by  the  mass  media  as  Japan 
(see  Literature;  Films  and  Television,  ch.  3;  The  Mass  Media  and 
Politics,  ch.  6).  Japan's  telecommunications  system  is  excellent  both 
in  domestic  and  foreign  service.  The  rapid  spread  of  television  sets 
in  the  1960s,  and  advances  in  satellite  communications  in  the  1970s, 
which  permitted  rapid  improvements  in  television  broadcasting, 
were  major  postwar  factors  in  Japan's  new  information  society. 

The  broadcast  industry  has  been  dominated  by  the  Japan  Broad- 
casting Corporation  (Nippon  Hoso  Kyokai — NHK)  since  its  found- 
ing in  1925.  It  operated  two  public  television  and  three  radio 
networks  nationally,  producing  about  1,700  programs  per  week 
in  the  late  1980s.  Its  general  and  education  programs  were  broad- 
cast through  more  than  6,900  television  and  nearly  330  AM  and 
more  than  500  FM  radio  transmitting  stations.  Comprehensive  ser- 
vice in  twenty-one  languages  was  available  throughout  the  world. 
Although  NHK's  budget  and  operations  are  under  the  purview 
of  the  Ministry  of  Posts  and  Telecommunications,  the  Broadcast- 
ing Law  of  1950  provides  for  independent  management  and  pro- 
gramming by  NHK. 

Television  broadcasting  began  in  1953,  and  color  television  was 
introduced  in  1960.  Cable  television  was  introduced  in  1969.  In 
1978  an  experimental  broadcast  satellite  with  two  color  television 
channels  was  launched.  Operational  satellites  for  television  use  were 
launched  between  1984  and  1990.  Television  viewing  spread  so 
rapidly  that,  by  1987,  99  percent  of  Japan's  households  had  color 
television  sets  and  the  average  family  had  its  set  on  at  least  five 
hours  a  day.  Starting  in  1987,  NHK  began  full-scale  experimen- 
tal broadcasting  on  two  channels  using  satellite-to-audience  sig- 
nals, thus  bringing  service  to  remote  and  mountainous  parts  of  the 
country  that  earlier  had  experienced  poor  reception.  The  new  sys- 
tem also  provided  twenty-four  hours  a  day,  nonstop  service. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Japan  also  had  more  than  100  commercial  tele- 
vision companies,  which  operated  more  than  6,300  stations,  and 
the  country  had  more  than  140  commercial  radio  companies  oper- 
ating about  630  medium  wave,  short  wave,  and  FM  stations,  in- 
cluding several  national  as  well  as  many  local  stations.  Broadcasting 
innovations  in  the  1980s  included  sound  multiplex  (two-language 
or  stereo)  broadcasting,  satellite  broadcasting,  and  in  1985  the 
University  of  the  Air  and  teletext  services  were  inaugurated. 

Rapid  improvements,  innovations,  and  diversification  in  com- 
munications technology,  including  optical  fiber  cables,  communi- 
cations satellites,  and  facsimile  machines,  led  to  rapid  growth  of

the  communications  industry  in  the  1980s.  Nippon  Telegraph  and 
Telephone  Corporation,  government- owned  until  1985,  had  domi- 
nated the  communications  industry  until  April  1985,  when  new 
common  carriers,  including  Daini  Denden,  were  permitted  to  enter 
the  field.  Kokusai  Denshin  Denwa  Company  lost  its  monopoly  hold 
on  international  communications  activities  in  1989,  when  Nihon 
Kokusai  Tsushin  and  other  private  overseas  communications  firms 
began  operations. 

Japan's  first  satellite  was  launched  in  1970,  followed  by  subse- 
quent launches  of  experimental  and  applications  satellites  in  fields 
such  as  communications,  broadcasting,  meteorology,  and  earth  ob- 
servation. Satellites  were  launched  from  Japan's  Tanegashima 
Space  Center  on  the  island  of  Tanegashima  in  Kagoshima  Prefec- 
ture. Japanese  space  scientists  have  successfully  launched  three  H-I 
rockets  that  accommodate  a  payload  of  550  kilograms  each.  Japan 
also  cooperated  with  the  United  States,  Western  Europe,  and  Can- 
ada to  construct  an  earth-orbiting  space  station.  In  1990  a  consor- 
tium of  Japanese  firms  led  by  Mitsubishi  Heavy  Industries  was 
planning  to  enter  the  commercial  rocket  industry  by  the  mid-1990s, 
but  unexpectedly  high  costs  and  the  need  to  further  improve  the 
H-II  booster,  the  first  rocket  designed  and  developed  entirely  in 
Japan,  meant  that  Japanese  commercial  launch  services  would  prob- 
ably not  begin  until  the  late  1990s. 

Japan's  burgeoning  high-technology  communications  system  in- 
cluded the  widespread  use  of  telephones.  In  1989  there  were  64 
million  telephones  in  Japan,  nearly  one  for  every  two  people. 

Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fishing 

Agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing  dominated  the  Japanese  econ- 
omy through  the  1940s,  but  thereafter  declined  in  relative  impor- 
tance. In  the  1870s,  these  sectors  accounted  for  more  than  82  percent 
of  employment.  Employment  in  agriculture  declined  in  the  prewar 
period,  but  the  sector  was  still  the  largest  employer  (about  50  per- 
cent of  the  work  force)  by  the  end  of  World  War  II.  It  further 
declined  to  23.5  percent  in  1965,  11.9  percent  in  1977,  and  to  8.3 
percent  in  1988.  The  importance  of  agriculture  in  the  national  econ- 
omy later  continued  its  rapid  decline,  with  the  share  of  net  agricul- 
tural production  in  GNP  finally  reduced  between  1975  and  1989 
from  4.1  to  3  percent.  In  the  late  1980s,  85.5  percent  of  Japan's 
farmers  were  also  engaged  in  occupations  outside  of  farming,  and 
most  of  these  part-time  farmers  earned  most  of  their  income  from 
nonfarming  activities  (see  table  23,  Appendix). 

Japan's  economic  boom  that  began  in  the  1950s  left  farmers  far 
behind  both  in  income  and  agricultural  technology.  Farmers  were 


244 


The  Character  and  Structure  of  the  Economy 

determined  to  close  this  income  gap  as  quickly  as  possible.  They 
were  attracted  to  the  government's  food  control  policy  under  which 
high  rice  prices  were  guaranteed  and  farmers  were  encouraged  to 
increase  the  output  of  any  crops  of  their  own  choice.  Farmers  be- 
came mass  producers  of  rice,  even  turning  their  own  vegetable 
gardens  into  rice  fields.  Their  output  swelled  to  over  14  million 
tons  in  the  late  1960s,  a  direct  result  of  greater  cultivated  acreage 
and  increased  yield  per  unit  area  owing  to  improved  cultivation 
techniques. 

Three  types  of  farm  households  developed:  those  engaging  ex- 
clusively in  agriculture  (14.5  percent  of  the  4.2  million  farm  house- 
holds in  1988,  down  from  21.5  percent  in  1965);  those  deriving 
more  than  half  their  income  from  the  farm  (14.2  percent,  down 
from  36.7  percent  in  1965);  and  those  mainly  engaged  in  jobs  other 
than  farming  (71.3  percent,  up  from  41 .8  percent  in  1965).  As  more 
and  more  farm  families  turned  to  nonfarming  activities,  the  farm 
population  declined  (down  from  4.9  million  in  1975  to  4.8  million 
in  1988).  The  rate  of  decrease  slowed  in  the  late  1970s  and  1980s, 
but  the  average  age  of  farmers  rose  to  fifty-one  years  by  1980,  twelve 
years  older  than  the  average  industrial  employee. 

The  most  striking  feature  of  Japanese  agriculture  was  the  short- 
age of  farmland.  The  4.9  million  hectares  under  cultivation  con- 
stituted just  13.2  percent  of  the  total  land  area  in  1988.  However, 
the  land  was  intensively  cultivated.  Rice  paddies  occupied  most 
of  the  countryside,  whether  on  the  alluvial  plains,  the  terraced 
slopes,  or  the  swampland  and  coastal  bays.  Nonrice  farmlands 
shared  such  terraces  and  lower  slopes  and  were  planted  with  wheat 
and  barley  in  the  autumn  and  with  sweet  potatoes,  vegetables,  and 
dry  rice  in  the  summer.  Intercropping  was  common:  such  crops 
were  alternated  with  beans  and  peas. 

Japanese  agriculture  has  been  characterized  as  a  "sick"  sector 
because  it  must  contend  with  a  variety  of  constraints,  such  as  the 
rapidly  diminishing  availability  of  arable  land  and  falling  agricul- 
tural incomes.  Nevertheless,  the  Japanese  managed  production  at 
high  levels.  Agriculture  was  maintained  through  the  use  of  techni- 
cally advanced  fertilizers  and  farm  machinery,  and  a  vast  array 
of  price  supports.  The  nation's  many  agricultural  cooperatives  were 
in  charge  of  purchasing  grain  according  to  prices  indexed  to  the 
average  wage  rates  in  the  nonagricultural  sector.  As  a  result,  rice, 
wheat,  and  barley  prices  followed  productivity  trends  in  industry 
rather  than  in  agriculture.  This  type  of  support  system,  enacted 
in  1960  along  with  the  Basic  Agricultural  Law,  resulted  in  large 
government  rice  stockpiles  and  high  agricultural  prices.  Excessive 
rice  production  had  an  adverse  effect  on  other  crop  production. 


245 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Japan's  self-sufficiency  ratio  for  grains  other  than  rice  fell  below 
10  percent  in  the  1970s  and  but  rose  to  14  percent  in  the  mid-  to 
late  1980s.  The  problem  of  surplus  rice  was  further  aggravated  by 
extensive  changes  in  the  diets  of  many  Japanese  in  the  1970s  and 
1980s.  Even  a  major  rice  crop  failure  did  not  reduce  the  accumu- 
lated stocks  by  more  than  25  percent  of  the  reserve.  In  1987,  Japan 
was  71  percent  self-sufficient  in  food,  but  only  provided  about  30 
percent  of  its  cereals  and  fodder  needs. 

Livestock  raising  was  a  minor  activity.  Demand  for  beef  rose 
strongly  in  the  1980s  and  farmers  often  shifted  from  dairy  farm- 
ing to  production  of  high-quality  (and  high-cost)  beef.  Through- 
out the  1980s,  domestic  beef  production  met  over  60  percent  of 
demand.  In  1991,  as  a  result  of  heavy  pressure  from  the  United 
States,  Japan  ended  import  quotas  on  beef  as  well  as  citrus  fruit 
(see  Import  Policies,  ch.  5).  Milk  cows  were  numerous  in  Hokkaido, 
where  25  percent  of  farmers  ran  dairies,  but  milk  cows  were  also 
raised  in  Iwate,  in  Tohoku,  and  near  Tokyo  and  Kobe.  Beef  cat- 
tle were  mostly  concentrated  in  western  Honshu,  and  Kyushu. 
Hogs,  the  oldest  domesticated  animals  raised  for  food,  were  found 
everywhere.  Pork  was  the  most  popular  meat. 

The  nation's  forest  resources,  although  abundant,  had  not  been 
well  developed  to  sustain  a  large  lumber  industry.  Of  the  24.5  mil- 
lion hectares  of  forests,  19.8  million  were  classified  as  active  forests. 
Most  often  forestry  was  a  part-time  activity  for  farmers  or  small 
companies.  About  a  third  of  all  forests  were  owned  by  the  govern- 
ment. Production  was  highest  in  Hokkaido  and  in  Aomori,  Iwate, 
Akita,  Fukushima,  Gifu,  Miyazaki,  and  Kagoshima  prefectures. 
Nearly  33.5  million  cubic  meters  of  roundwood  were  produced  in 
1986,  of  which  98  percent  was  destined  for  industrial  uses. 

Japan  was  the  world's  largest  fishing  nation  in  tonnage  of  fish 
caught — 12.5  million  tons  in  1987,  up  from  9.3  million  tons  in  1970 
and  11.12  million  tons  in  1980.  After  the  1973  energy  crisis,  deep- 
sea  fishing  in  Japan  declined,  with  the  annual  catch  in  the  1980s 
averaging  2  million  tons.  Offshore  fisheries  accounted  for  an  average 
of  50  percent  of  the  nation's  total  fish  catches  in  the  late  1980s, 
although  they  experienced  repeated  ups  and  downs  during  that  pe- 
riod. Coastal  fisheries  had  smaller  catches  than  northern  sea  fish- 
eries in  1986  and  1987.  As  a  whole,  Japan's  fish  catches  registered 
a  slower  growth  in  the  late  1980s.  By  contrast,  Japan's  import  of 
marine  products  increased  greatly  in  the  1980s,  surpassing  2  mil- 
lion tons  in  1987.  Japan  also  introduced  the  "culture  and  breed" 
fishing  system  or  sea  farming.  In  this  system,  artificial  insemina- 
tion and  hatching  techniques  are  used  to  breed  fish  and  shellfish,

which  are  then  released  into  rivers  or  seas.  These  fish  and  shellfish 
are  caught  after  they  grow  bigger.  Salmon  was  one  cultured  fish. 
Japan  is  also  one  of  the  world's  few  whaling  nations.  As  a  mem- 
ber of  the  International  Whaling  Commission,  the  government 
pledged  that  its  fleets  would  restrict  their  catch  to  international 
quotas,  but  it  attracted  international  opprobrium  for  its  failure  to 
sign  an  agreement  placing  a  moratorium  on  sperm  whaling.  Japan 
has  more  than  2,000  fishing  ports,  including  Nagasaki,  in  south- 
west Kyushu;  Otaru,  Kushiro,  and  Abashiri  in  Hokkaido;  and 
Yaezu  and  Misaki  on  the  east  coast  of  Honshu. 

Living  Standards 

In  general,  Japanese  consumers  have  benefited  from  the  nation's 
economic  growth,  while  in  turn  they  have  stimulated  the  econ- 
omy through  demand  for  sophisticated  products,  loyalty  to  domes- 
tically produced  goods,  and  saving  and  pooling  investment  funds. 
But  personal  disposable  income  has  not  risen  as  fast  as  the  econ- 
omy as  a  whole  in  many  years — at  1  percentage  point  less  than 
average  GNP  growth  in  the  late  1980s.  Despite  the  hard  work  and 
sacrifice  that  have  made  Japan  one  of  the  wealthiest  nations  in  the 
world,  some  Japanese  feel  they  are  "a  rich  nation,  but  a  poor  peo- 
ple." Such  a  negative  view  of  the  economy  was  prompted  by  the 


247 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


fact  that  the  average  consumer  had  to  pay  dearly  for  goods  and 
services  that  were  much  cheaper  elsewhere. 

Real  household  expenditures  did  rise  during  Japan's  economic 
growth.  Living  standards  improved  sharply  in  the  1970s  and  1980s. 
The  share  of  total  family  living  expenses  devoted  to  food  dropped 
from  35  percent  in  1970  to  27  percent  in  1986,  while  net  house- 
hold savings,  which  averaged  slightly  over  20  percent  in  the 
mid-1970s,  averaged  between  15  and  20  percent  in  the  1980s. 
Japanese  households  thus  had  greater  disposable  income  to  pay  for 
improved  housing  and  other  consumer  items.  The  increase  in  dis- 
posable income  partly  explained  the  economic  boom  of  the  1980s, 
which  was  pushed  by  explosive  domestic  demand. 

Japanese  income  distribution  in  the  1980s,  both  before  and  after 
taxes,  was  among  the  most  equitable  in  the  world.  An  important 
factor  in  income  distribution  was  that  the  lower  income  group  was 
better  off  than  in  most  industrialized  countries. 

Japanese  homes,  although  they  were  relatively  new,  were  much 
smaller  and  often  had  fewer  amenities  than  those  in  other  indus- 
trialized nations.  Even  though  the  percentage  of  residences  with 
flush  toilets  jumped  from  31.4  percent  in  1973  to  65.8  percent  in 
1988,  this  figure  was  still  far  lower  than  in  other  industrialized  states. 
In  some  primarily  rural  areas  of  Japan,  it  was  still  under  30  per- 
cent. Even  9.7  percent  of  homes  built  between  1986  and  1988  did 
not  have  flush  toilets.  People  in  other  industrialized  countries  took 
central  heating  and  either  a  shower  or  bath  for  granted,  but  many 
Japanese  homes  were  lacking  in  all  three.  However,  by  1988  only 
9  percent  of  Japanese  residences  had  no  bathtub,  a  figure  that  had 
improved  from  nearly  27  percent  in  1973.  The  alternative  for  many 
Japanese  remained  public  baths,  although  these  were  gradually  dis- 
appearing. Additionally,  81  percent  of  Japanese  households  used 
kerosene  heaters  as  the  main  source  of  heat. 

Japanese  housing  in  the  early  1990s  was  very  expensive  relative 
to  annual  income,  but  the  high  cost  was  somewhat  offset  by  low 
interest  rates  and  probable  future  income  gains,  making  Japanese 
housing  more  affordable  than  it  might  appear.  There  were  also 
many  urban  apartments  found  near  public  transportation  that 
rented  for  as  little  as  US$600  to  US$800  a  month  in  early  1990. 

The  Westernization  of  many  areas  of  Japanese  life  included  con- 
suming a  greater  diversity  of  foods.  After  World  War  II,  Japanese 
dietary  patterns  changed  radically  and  came  to  resemble  those  of 
the  West.  While  older  Japanese  still  preferred  a  breakfast  with  tradi- 
tional dishes — boiled  rice,  miso  soup,  and  pickled  vegetables — 
younger  Japanese  had  toast  and  coffee.  The  Japanese  diet  improved 
along  with  other  living  standards.  Average  intake  per  day  was  2,084

calories  and  77.9  grams  of  protein,  in  the  late  1980s.  Of  total  pro- 
tein intake,  26.5  percent  came  from  cereals  (including  18.4  per- 
cent from  rice),  9.6  percent  from  pulses,  23.1  percent  from  fish, 
14.8  percent  from  livestock  products,  11  percent  from  eggs  and 
milk,  and  15  percent  from  other  sources.  Before  World  War  II, 
the  average  annual  consumption  of  rice  was  1 40  kilograms  per  cap- 
ita, but  it  fell  to  72  kilograms  in  1987.  This  development  further 
exacerbated  the  problem  of  rice  oversupply,  leading  to  a  huge  rice 
stock  and  creating  great  deficits  in  the  government's  foodstuff  con- 
trol account.  The  government  inaugurated  several  policies  to  switch 
to  nonrice  crops,  but  they  met  with  limited  success  and  rice  re- 
mained in  oversupply. 

A  negative  aspect  of  Japan's  economic  growth  was  industrial  pol- 
lution. Until  the  mid-1970s,  both  public  and  private  sectors  pur- 
sued economic  growth  with  such  single-mindedness  that  prosperity 
was  accompanied  by  severe  degradation  of  both  the  environment 
and  quality  of  life  (see  Pollution,  ch.  2). 

Typically,  Japanese  consumers  have  been  savers  as  well  as  buy- 
ers, partly  because  of  habit,  but  by  1980  the  consumer  credit  in- 
dustry began  to  flourish.  Younger  families  were  particularly  prone 
to  take  on  debt.  Housing  was  the  largest  single  item  for  which 


249 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

consumers  contracted  loans.  In  1989  families  annually  borrowed 
an  estimated  US$17,000  or  about  23  percent  of  their  average  sav- 
ings. Those  who  wished  to  buy  houses  and  real  estate  needed  an 
average  US$242,600,  of  which  they  borrowed  about  US$129,000. 
But  many  younger  families  in  the  1980s  were  giving  up  the  idea 
of  ever  buying  a  house.  This  change  led  many  young  Japanese  to 
spend  part  of  their  savings  on  trips  abroad,  expensive  consumer 
items,  and  other  luxuries.  As  one  young  worker  put  it,  "If  I  can 
never  buy  a  house,  at  least  I  can  use  my  money  to  enjoy  life  now. ' ' 
As  credit  card  and  finance  agency  facilities  expanded,  the  use  of 
credit  to  procure  other  consumer  durables  was  spreading.  By  1989 
the  number  of  credit  cards  issued  in  Japan  reached  virtual  parity 
with  the  population. 

Japanese  families  still  feel  that  saving  for  retirement  is  critical 
because  of  the  relative  inadequacy  of  official  social  security  and 
private  pension  plans.  The  average  family  in  1989  had  US$76,500 
in  savings,  a  figure  far  short  of  what  was  needed  to  cover  the  liv- 
ing expenses  for  retired  individuals,  although  official  pensions  and 
retirement  allowances  did  help  cover  the  financial  burdens  of  senior 
citizens.  The  annual  living  expenses  for  retired  individuals  in  1989 
were  estimated  at  US$22,800,  half  of  which  was  received  from 
government  pensions  and  the  rest  from  savings  and  retirement  al- 
lowances. Senior  citizens  in  their  seventies  had  the  largest  savings, 
including  deposits,  insurance,  and  negotiable  securities  worth  an 
estimated  US$1 13,000  per  person.  In  1989  individuals  in  their  twen- 
ties had  savings  amounting  to  US$23,800,  while  salaried  workers 
in  their  thirties  had  US$66,000  in  savings. 

The  Japanese  consumer  benefited  most  from  the  availability  of 
compact,  sophisticated  consumer  products  that  were  popular  ex- 
ports. Television  sets,  watches,  clothing,  automobiles,  household 
appliances,  and  personal  computers  were  quality  items  that  industry 
provided  in  quantity.  In  the  late  1980s,  virtually  every  Japanese 
family  had  one  or  more  television  sets,  a  washing  machine,  a 
refrigerator,  small  space  heaters,  and  cameras.  Sixty  percent  of 
Japanese  homes  in  1989  had  air  conditioning  of  some  kind.  Other 
popular  items  in  the  1980s  included  electric  ranges,  video  cassette 
recorders,  video  cameras,  compact  disc  players,  and  personal  com- 
puters. Most  families  had  an  automobile. 

It  is  difficult  to  make  cross-cultural  comparisons,  but  one  Japa- 
nese social  scientist  ranked  Japan  among  a  group  of  ten  other  in- 
dustrialized nations  according  to  a  variety  of  variables.  In  this 
comparison,  for  which  there  is  data  from  the  mid-1970s  to  the  late 
1980s,  Japan  was  better  than  average  in  terms  of  overall  income 
distribution,  per  capita  disposable  income,  traffic  safety  and  crime,

life  expectancy  and  infant  mortality,  proportion  of  owner-occupied 
homes,  work  stoppages  and  labor  unrest,  worker  absenteeism,  and 
air  pollution.  Japan  was  below  average  for  wage  differentials  by 
gender  and  firm  size,  labor's  share  of  total  manufacturing  income, 
social  security  and  unemployment  benefits,  weekly  workdays  and 
daily  work  hours,  overall  price  of  land  and  housing,  river  pollu- 
tion, sewage  facilities,  and  recreational  park  areas  in  urban  centers. 
Some  of  these  variables,  especially  pollution  and  increased  leisure 
time,  improved  in  the  1980s,  and,  in  general,  living  standards  in 
Japan  were  comparable  to  those  of  the  world's  wealthiest  economies.

Chapter  5.  International  Economic  Relations 


Family  crest  using  bamboo  (take)  leaves  and  stems,  symbols  of  endurance 
and  resilience 


JAPAN  IS  BOTH  a  major  trading  nation  and  one  of  the  largest 
international  investors  in  the  world.  In  many  respects,  international 
trade  is  the  lifeblood  of  Japan's  economy,  and  it  is  the  window 
through  which  most  people  in  the  United  States  view  Japan.  Im- 
ports and  exports  totaling  the  equivalent  of  US$452  billion  in  1988 
meant  that  Japan  was  the  world's  third  largest  trading  nation  after 
the  United  States  and  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Ger- 
many). Trade  was  once  the  primary  form  of  Japan's  international 
economic  relationships,  but  in  the  1980s,  its  rapidly  rising  foreign 
investments  added  a  new  and  increasingly  important  dimension, 
broadening  the  horizons  of  Japanese  businesses  and  giving  Japan 
new  world  prominence. 

Japan's  international  economic  relations  in  the  first  three  de- 
cades after  World  War  II  were  shaped  largely  by  two  factors:  a 
relative  lack  of  domestic  raw  materials  and  a  determination  to  catch 
up  with  the  industrial  nations  of  the  West.  Because  of  Japan's  lack 
of  raw  materials,  its  exports  have  consisted  almost  exclusively  of 
manufactured  goods,  and  raw  materials  have  represented  a  large 
share  of  its  imports.  The  country's  sense  of  dependency  and  vul- 
nerability has  also  been  strong  because  of  its  lack  of  raw  materials. 
Japan's  determination  to  catch  up  with  the  West  encouraged  poli- 
cies to  move  away  from  simple  labor-intensive  exports  toward  more 
sophisticated  export  products  (from  textiles  in  the  1950s  to  automo- 
biles and  consumer  electronics  in  the  1980s),  and  pursue  protec- 
tionist policies  to  limit  foreign  competition  for  domestic  industries. 

The  sense  of  dependence  on  imported  raw  materials  was  espe- 
cially strong  in  Japan  during  the  1970s,  when  crude  petroleum  and 
other  material  prices  rose  and  supply  was  uncertain.  Throughout 
much  of  the  postwar  period,  in  fact,  Japanese  government  policy 
has  aimed  at  generating  sufficient  exports  to  pay  for  raw  material 
imports.  During  the  1980s,  however,  raw  material  prices  fell  and 
the  feeling  of  vulnerability  lessened.  The  1980s  also  brought  rapidly 
rising  trade  surpluses,  so  that  Japan  could  export  far  more  than 
was  needed  to  balance  its  imports.  With  these  developments,  some 
of  the  resistance  to  manufactured  imports,  long  considered  luxu- 
ries in  the  relative  absence  of  raw  materials,  began  to  dissipate. 

By  the  1980s,  Japan  had  caught  up.  Now  an  advanced  indus- 
trial nation,  it  faced  new  changes  in  its  economy,  on  both  domes- 
tic and  international  fronts,  including  demands  to  supply  more 
foreign  aid  and  to  open  its  markets  for  imports.  It  had  become  a 


255 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

leader  in  the  international  economic  system,  through  its  success 
in  certain  export  markets,  its  leading  technologies,  and  its  growth 
as  a  major  investor  around  the  world.  These  were  epochal  changes 
for  Japan,  after  a  century  in  which  the  main  national  motivation 
was  to  catch  up  with  the  West.  These  dramatic  changes  also  fed 
domestic  developments  that  were  lessening  the  society's  insularity 
and  parochialism. 

The  processes  through  which  Japan  was  becoming  a  key  mem- 
ber of  the  international  economic  community  were  expected  to  con- 
tinue in  the  1990s — productivity  continued  to  grow  at  a  healthy 
pace,  the  country's  international  leadership  in  a  number  of  indus- 
tries remained  unquestioned,  and  investments  abroad  continued 
to  expand.  Pressures  were  likely  to  lead  to  further  openness  to  im- 
ports, increased  aid  to  foreign  countries,  and  involvement  in  the 
running  of  major  international  institutions,  such  as  the  Interna- 
tional Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary).  As  Japan  achieved 
a  more  prominent  international  position  during  the  1980s,  it  also 
generated  considerable  tension  with  its  trade  partners,  and  espe- 
cially with  the  United  States.  These  tensions  will  likely  remain, 
but  should  be  manageable  as  both  sides  continue  to  see  economic 
benefits  from  the  relationship. 

Postwar  Development 

After  the  end  of  World  War  II,  Japan's  economy  was  in  a  sham- 
bles, and  its  international  economic  relations  almost  completely  dis- 
rupted. Initially,  imports  were  limited  to  essential  food  and  raw 
materials,  mostly  financed  by  economic  assistance  from  the  United 
States.  Because  of  extreme  domestic  shortages,  exports  did  not  begin 
to  recover  until  the  Korean  War  (1950-53),  when  special  procure- 
ment by  United  States  armed  forces  created  boom  conditions  in 
indigenous  industries.  By  1954  economic  recovery  and  rehabilita- 
tion were  essentially  complete.  For  much  of  the  1950s,  however, 
Japan  had  difficulty  exporting  as  much  as  it  imported,  leading  to 
chronic  trade  and  current  account  deficits.  Keeping  these  deficits 
under  control,  so  that  Japan  would  not  be  forced  to  devalue  its 
currency  under  the  Bretton  Woods  System  (see  Glossary)  of  fixed 
exchange  rates  that  prevailed  at  the  time,  was  a  primary  concern 
of  government  officials.  Stiff  quotas  and  tariffs  on  imports  were 
part  of  the  policy  response.  By  1960,  Japan  accounted  for  3.6  per- 
cent of  all  exports  of  noncommunist  countries. 

During  the  1960s,  the  dollar  value  of  exports  grew  at  an  aver- 
age annual  rate  of  16.9  percent,  more  than  75  percent  faster  than 
the  average  rate  of  all  noncommunist  countries.  By  1970  exports 
had  risen  to  nearly  6.9  percent  of  all  noncommunist-world  exports. 


256 


International  Economic  Relations 


The  rapid  productivity  growth  in  manufacturing  industries  made 
Japanese  products  more  competitive  in  world  markets  at  the  fixed 
exchange  rate  for  the  yen  (for  value  of  the  yen — see  Glossary)  during 
the  decade,  and  the  chronic  deficits  that  the  nation  faced  in  the 
1950s  had  disappeared  by  the  middle  of  the  1970s.  International 
pressure  to  dismantle  quota  and  tariff  barriers  mounted,  and  Japan 
began  moving  in  this  direction. 

The  1970s  brought  major,  wrenching  changes  for  Japan's  ex- 
ternal relations.  The  decade  began  with  the  end  of  the  fixed  ex- 
change rate  for  the  yen  (a  change  brought  about  mainly  by  rapidly 
rising  Japanese  trade  and  current  account  surpluses)  and  with  a 
strong  rise  in  the  value  of  the  yen  under  the  new  system  of  floating 
rates.  Japan  also  faced  sharply  higher  bills  for  imports  of  energy 
and  other  raw  materials.  The  new  exchange  rates  and  the  rise  in 
raw  material  prices  meant  that  the  surpluses  of  the  decade's  be- 
ginning were  lost,  and  large  trade  deficits  followed  in  the  wake  of 
the  oil  price  shocks  of  1973  and  1979.  Expanding  the  country's 
exports  remained  a  priority  in  the  face  of  these  raw  material  sup- 
ply shocks,  and  during  the  decade  exports  continued  to  expand  at 
a  high  annual  average  rate  of  2 1  percent  (see  Balance  of  Merchan- 
dise Trade,  this  ch.). 

Most  of  the  concerns  of  the  1970s  diminished  in  the  1980s.  Oil 
and  other  raw  material  prices  fell  dramatically,  and  Japan's  trade 
deficits  turned  quickly  to  enormous  trade  surpluses  by  the  middle 
of  the  decade.  In  response  to  these  surpluses,  the  value  of  the  yen 
rose  against  that  of  other  currencies  in  the  last  half  of  the  decade, 
but  the  surpluses  proved  surprisingly  resilient  to  this  change.  The 
large  surpluses,  combined  with  foreign  perceptions  that  Japan's 
import  markets  were  still  relatively  closed,  exacerbated  tension 
between  Japan  and  a  number  of  its  principal  trading  partners,  es- 
pecially the  United  States.  A  rapid  increase  in  imports  of  manufac- 
tured goods  after  1987  eased  some  of  these  tensions,  but  as  the 
decade  ended  friction  still  continued. 

Through  most  of  the  postwar  period,  foreign  investment  was  not 
a  significant  part  of  Japan's  external  economic  relations.  Both  in- 
ward and  outward  investments  were  carefully  controlled  by  govern- 
ment regulations,  which  kept  the  investment  flows  small.  These 
controls  applied  to  direct  investment  in  the  creation  of  subsidiaries 
under  the  control  of  a  parent  company,  portfolio  investment,  and 
lending.  Controls  were  motivated  by  the  desire  to  prevent  foreigners 
(mainly  Americans)  from  gaining  ownership  of  the  economy  when 
Japan  was  in  a  weak  position  after  World  War  II,  and  by  concerns 
over  the  balance  of  payments  deficits  (see  Capital  Flows,  this  ch.). 
Beginning  in  the  late  1960s,  these  controls  were  gradually  loosened, 


257 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

and  the  process  of  deregulation  accelerated  and  continued  through- 
out the  1980s.  The  result  was  a  dramatic  increase  in  capital  move- 
ments, with  the  biggest  change  occurring  in  outflows — investments 
by  Japanese  in  other  countries.  By  the  end  of  the  1980s,  Japan  had 
become  a  major  international  investor.  Because  the  country  was 
a  newcomer  to  the  world  of  overseas  investment,  this  development 
led  to  new  forms  of  tension  with  other  countries,  including  criti- 
cism of  highly  visible  Japanese  acquisitions  in  the  United  States 
and  elsewhere. 

Trade  and  Investment  Institutions 

The  Ministry  of  International  Trade  and  Industry 

Japan's  Ministry  of  International  Trade  and  Industry  (MITI) 
was  formed  in  1949  from  the  union  of  the  Trade  Agency  and  the 
Ministry  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  in  an  effort  to  curb  postwar 
inflation  and  provide  government  leadership  and  assistance  for  the 
restoration  of  industrial  productivity  and  employment. 

MITI  has  held  primary  responsibility  for  formulating  and  im- 
plementing international  trade  policy,  although  it  has  done  so  by 
seeking  a  consensus  among  interested  parties,  including  the  Minis- 
try of  Foreign  Affairs,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (see  The  Role 
of  Government  and  Business,  ch.  4).  MITI  has  also  coordinated 
trade  policy  with  the  Economic  Planning  Agency,  the  Bank  of 
Japan,  and  the  ministries  of  agriculture,  forestry  and  fisheries, 
health  and  welfare,  construction,  transportation,  and  posts  and 
telecommunications  on  issues  affecting  their  interests.  As  trade  is- 
sues broadened  in  scope,  these  other  ministries  became  more  im- 
portant in  international  negotiating,  so  that  in  the  late  1980s  MITI 
had  less  control  in  formulating  international  trade  policy  than  it 
had  had  in  the  1950s  and  1960s.  The  prime  minister,  the  National 
Diet  (Japan's  legislature),  and  the  Fair  Trade  Commission  have 
also  circumscribed  MITI's  operations. 

MITI  has  been  responsible  not  only  in  the  areas  of  exports  and 
imports,  but  also  for  all  domestic  industries  and  businesses  not  spe- 
cifically covered  by  other  ministries,  for  investments  in  plant  and 
equipment,  pollution  control,  energy  and  power,  some  aspects  of 
foreign  economic  assistance,  and  consumer  complaints.  This  span 
has  allowed  MITI  to  integrate  conflicting  policies,  such  as  those 
on  pollution  control  and  export  competitiveness,  to  minimize  dam- 
age to  export  industries. 

MITI  has  served  as  an  architect  of  industrial  policy,  an  arbiter 
on  industrial  problems  and  disputes,  and  a  regulator.  A  major 
objective  of  the  ministry  has  been  to  strengthen  the  country's 


258 


International  Economic  Relations 


industrial  base.  It  has  not  managed  Japanese  trade  and  industry 
along  the  lines  of  a  centrally  planned  economy,  but  it  has  provided 
industries  with  administrative  guidance  and  other  direction,  both 
formal  and  informal,  on  modernization,  technology,  investments 
in  new  plants  and  equipment,  and  on  domestic  and  foreign  com- 
petition. 

The  close  relationship  between  MITI  and  Japanese  industry  has 
led  to  foreign  trade  policy  that  often  complements  the  ministry's 
efforts  to  strengthen  domestic  manufacturing  interests.  MITI  facili- 
tated the  early  development  of  nearly  all  major  industries  by  provid- 
ing protection  from  import  competition,  technological  intelligence, 
help  in  licensing  foreign  technology,  access  to  foreign  exchange, 
or  assistance  in  mergers. 

These  policies  to  promote  domestic  industry  and  to  protect  it 
from  international  competition  were  strongest  in  the  1950s  and 
1960s.  As  industry  became  stronger  and  as  MITI  lost  some  of  its 
policy  tools,  such  as  control  over  allocation  of  foreign  exchange, 
MITFs  policies  also  changed.  The  success  of  Japanese  exports  and 
the  tension  it  has  caused  in  other  countries  led  MITI  to  provide 
guidance  on  limiting  exports  of  particular  products  to  various  coun- 
tries. Starting  in  1981,  MITI  presided  over  the  establishment  of 
voluntary  restraints  on  automobile  exports  to  the  United  States, 
to  allay  criticism  from  American  manufacturers  and  their  unions. 

Similarly,  MITI  was  forced  to  liberalize  import  policies,  despite 
its  traditional  protectionist  focus.  During  the  1980s,  the  ministry 
helped  to  craft  a  number  of  market-opening  and  import-promoting 
measures,  including  the  creation  of  an  import  promotion  office 
within  the  ministry.  The  close  relationship  between  MITI  and  in- 
dustry allowed  the  ministry  to  play  such  a  role  in  fostering  more 
open  markets  but  conflict  remained  between  the  need  to  open  mar- 
kets and  the  desire  to  continue  promoting  new  and  growing  domes- 
tic industries. 

The  Japan  External  Trade  Organization 

The  Japan  External  Trade  Organization  (JETRO)  was  estab- 
lished by  MITI  in  1958  to  consolidate  Japan's  efforts  in  export  pro- 
motion. The  government  has  provided  more  than  half  of  JETRO 's 
annual  operating  budget.  As  of  1989,  JETRO  maintained  seventy- 
eight  offices  in  fifty-seven  countries,  as  well  as  thirty  offices  in  Japan, 
with  a  total  staff  of  1,200. 

Initially,  JETRO 's  activities  focused  mainly  on  promoting  ex- 
ports to  other  countries.  As  exporters  established  themselves  in 
world  markets  and  the  balance  of  trade  turned  from  deficit  to  sur- 
plus, however,  JETRO 's  role  shifted  to  encompass  more  varied

activities.  These  have  included  the  furtherance  of  mutual  under- 
standing with  trading  partners,  import  promotion,  liaison  between 
small  businesses  in  Japan  and  their  overseas  counterparts,  and  data 
dissemination.  Import  promotion  services  have  included  publica- 
tions, promotion  of  trade  fairs,  seminars,  and  trade  missions. 

Trading  Companies 

A  major  Japanese  innovation  in  international  trade  has  been  the 
development  of  large  integrated  general  trading  companies.  These 
corporations  were  first  organized  during  the  late  nineteenth  cen- 
tury as  part  of  the  effort  to  replace  the  foreign  companies  dominating 
Japan's  trade  and  to  provide  foreign  marketing  services  to  Japanese 
firms  unfamiliar  with  the  outside  world. 

At  first,  trading  companies  acted  as  specialized  wholesalers  for 
Japanese  manufacturers  in  domestic  and  foreign  markets  and 
bought  raw  materials  and  other  inputs  for  manufacturing  opera- 
tions. Later,  trading  companies  also  served  as  financial  intermedi- 
aries, absorbed  foreign  exchange  risk  for  their  customers,  provided 
technical  advice  to  small  firms  whose  products  might  be  exported, 
and  engaged  in  direct  investment  overseas,  often  to  secure  stable 
sources  of  supply. 

After  World  War  II,  the  trading  companies  developed  some  third- 
country  trade,  some  of  which  did  not  involve  Japanese  products 
or  firms.  Such  transactions  included  arranging  for  the  sale  of  a 
United  States  chemical  plant  to  the  Soviet  Union  and  importing 
Romanian  urea  into  Bangladesh.  By  1988,  such  offshore  trade  ac- 
counted for  almost  20  percent  of  total  sales  of  the  nine  largest  trading 
companies  in  Japan. 

In  the  1980s,  several  thousand  trading  companies  existed  in 
Japan.  The  top  nine  companies,  however,  accounted  for  the  bulk 
of  the  transactions.  In  fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glossary)  1988,  C.  Itoh 
led  with  sales  of  ¥15.6  trillion,  followed  by  Mitsui  (¥14.8  trillion), 
Sumitomo  (¥14.6  trillion),  Marubeni  (¥14.2  trillion),  and  Mi- 
tsubishi (¥13.8  trillion).  Others  in  the  top  nine  were  Nissho  Iwai, 
Tomen,  Nichimen,  and  Kanematsu-Gosho.  These  companies  were 
very  important  in  Japan's  foreign  trade:  in  1988  they  together  han- 
dled 42  percent  of  exports  and  74  percent  of  imports. 

These  companies  were  best  at  handling  large-volume  bulk 
products,  such  as  raw  materials.  They  faced  some  difficulties  in 
the  1970s  and  1980s  with  fluctuations  in  international  raw  mate- 
rial markets,  but  they  continued  to  play  a  very  important  role  in 
Japan's  international  trade.  During  the  1980s,  they  increasingly 
acted  through  direct  investment.

International  Economic  Relations 


Financial  Institutions 

For  most  of  the  postwar  period,  Japan's  financial  institutions 
operated  in  a  severely  regulated  environment:  most  interest  rates 
were  controlled,  the  type  of  business  these  institutions  could  en- 
gage in  was  narrowly  circumscribed,  and  few  international  trans- 
actions were  possible.  Beginning  in  the  1970s,  these  controls  began 
to  loosen,  and  financial  institutions  rapidly  expanded  their  inter- 
national activities.  By  the  end  of  the  1980s,  they  were  major  inter- 
national players. 

The  major  international  players  were  "city"  banks  (the  thirteen 
largest  banks  in  Japan,  which  operated  nationwide  branches),  in- 
vestment houses,  and  life  insurance  companies,  which  invested 
heavily  in  pension  funds  abroad  in  the  1980s  (see  The  Financial 
System,  ch.  4).  In  1988,  the  nine  largest  banks  in  the  world,  mea- 
sured by  total  assets,  were  Japanese  banks.  These  banks  opened 
branches  abroad,  acquired  existing  foreign  banks,  and  became  en- 
gaged in  new  activities,  such  as  underwriting  Euro-yen  bond  is- 
sues. The  investment  houses  also  increased  overseas  activities, 
especially  participating  in  the  United  States  Treasury  bond  mar- 
ket (where  as  much  as  25  to  30  percent  of  each  new  issue  was  pur- 
chased by  Japanese  investors  in  the  late  1980s).  The  life  insurance 
companies  moved  heavily  into  foreign  investments  as  deregulation 
allowed  them  to  do  so  and  as  their  resources  increased  through  the 
spread  of  fully  funded  pension  funds. 

As  of  March  1989,  the  five  largest  city  banks  in  Japan  (in  order 
of  total  fund  volume)  were  Dai-Ichi  Kangyo  Bank,  Sumitomo  Bank, 
Fuji  Bank,  Mitsubishi  Bank,  and  Sanwa  Bank.  The  four  largest 
investment  houses,  which  dominated  the  securities  business,  were 
Nomura,  Daiwa,  Nikko,  and  Yamaichi. 

Besides  these  private  institutions,  there  were  a  number  of  gov- 
ernment-owned financial  institutions  in  the  late  1980s.  Of  these, 
the  Japan  Export-Import  Bank  (Exim  Bank)  was  the  only  one  with 
an  international  focus.  The  Exim  Bank  provided  financing  for  trade 
between  Japan  and  developing  countries,  performing  the  function 
of  export-import  banks  run  by  governments  in  other  countries  (in- 
cluding the  United  States),  although  its  participation  was  possibly 
greater. 

As  Japan  became  a  more  important  international  financial  power, 
Tokyo  became  a  world  financial  center.  In  April  1989,  the  aver- 
age daily  volume  of  transactions  in  the  Tokyo  foreign  exchange 
market  was  US$115  billion,  not  far  behind  the  US$129  billion  in 
New  York.  The  Tokyo  Securities  and  Stock  Exchange  also  rivaled 
the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  in  daily  volume,  overtaking  New 


261

York  in  1988  to  become  the  world's  largest  stock  exchange  in  terms 
of  the  combined  market  value  of  outstanding  shares  and  capitali- 
zation. 

Foreign  Aid  Institutions 

In  1990  Japan  had  three  government  institutions  involved  in  dis- 
bursing foreign  aid:  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency 
QIC  A),  the  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund  (OECF),  and 
the  Exim  Bank.  JICA  was  responsible  for  technical  cooperation; 
the  OECF  was  responsible  for  soft  loans;  and  the  Exim  Bank  had 
not  only  a  trade-financing  role  but  also  became  increasingly  in- 
volved in  lending  for  aid  programs.  The  Exim  Bank,  for  example, 
was  the  government  agency  chosen  to  carry  out  US$10  billion  in 
cofinancing  with  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary)  and  IMF  in  the 
1989  Brady  Plan  for  partial  relief  of  Mexico's  international  debt. 

International  Trade  and  Development  Institutions 

Japan  was  a  member  of  the  United  Nations  (UN),  IMF,  Or- 
ganisation for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD), 
and  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT — see  Glos- 
sary). It  also  participated  in  the  international  organizations  focus- 
ing on  economic  development,  including  the  World  Bank  and  the 
Asian  Development  Bank. 

As  a  member  of  the  IMF  and  World  Bank,  for  example,  Japan 
played  a  role  in  the  effort  during  the  1980s  to  address  the  interna- 
tional debt  crisis  brought  on  by  the  inability  of  certain  developing 
countries  to  service  their  foreign  debts  as  raw  material  prices  fell 
and  their  economies  stagnated.  As  a  member  of  the  IMF,  Japan 
also  cooperated  with  other  countries  in  moderating  the  short-run 
volatility  of  the  yen  and  participated  in  discussions  on  strengthen- 
ing the  international  monetary  system. 

Japan's  membership  in  the  OECD  has  constrained  its  foreign 
economic  policy  to  some  extent.  When  Japan  joined  the  OECD 
in  1966,  it  was  obliged  to  agree  to  OECD  principles  on  capital  liber- 
alization, an  obligation  that  led  Japan  to  begin  the  process  of  liber- 
alizing its  many  tight  controls  on  investment  flows  into  and  out 
of  Japan.  Japan  was  also  a  participant  in  the  OECD's  "gentle- 
men's agreement"  on  guidelines  for  government- supported  export 
credits,  which  placed  a  floor  on  interest  rates  and  other  terms  for 
loans  to  developing  countries  from  government- sponsored  export- 
import  banks. 

GATT  has  provided  the  basic  structure  through  which  Japan 
has  negotiated  detailed  international  agreements  on  import  and 


262

export  policies.  Although  Japan  had  been  a  member  of  GATT  since 
1955,  it  retained  reservations  to  some  GATT  articles,  permitting 
it  to  keep  in  place  stiff  quota  restrictions  until  the  early  1960s.  Japan 
took  its  GATT  obligations  seriously,  however,  and  a  number  of 
American  disputes  with  Japan  over  its  import  barriers  were  suc- 
cessfully resolved  by  obtaining  GATT  rulings,  with  which  Japan 
complied.  Japan  also  negotiated  bilaterally  with  countries  on  eco- 
nomic matters  of  mutual  interest. 

The  international  organization  with  the  strongest  Japanese  pres- 
ence has  been  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the  multilateral  lending 
agency  established  in  1966  that  made  soft  loans  to  developing  Asian 
countries.  Japan  and  the  United  States  have  had  the  largest  vot- 
ing rights  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Japan  has  tradi- 
tionally filled  the  presidency. 

As  Japan  became  a  greater  international  financial  power  in  the 
1980s,  its  role  in  financing  these  trade  and  development  institu- 
tions grew.  Previously,  the  government  had  been  a  very  quiet  par- 
ticipant in  these  organizations,  but  as  its  financial  role  increased, 
pressure  to  expand  voting  rights  and  play  a  more  active  policy  role 
mounted.  By  the  end  of  the  1980s,  Japan's  voting  rights  in  the 
World  Bank  had  increased,  and  discussions  were  proceeding  on 
a  similar  change  in  the  IMF.

Foreign  Trade  Policies 
Export  Policies 

For  many  years,  export  promotion  was  a  large  issue  in  Japanese 
government  policy.  Government  officials  recognized  that  Japan 
needed  to  import  to  grow  and  develop,  and  it  needed  to  generate 
exports  to  pay  for  those  imports.  After  the  war,  Japan  had  difficulty 
exporting  enough  to  pay  for  its  imports  until  the  mid-1960s,  and 
resulting  deficits  were  the  justification  for  export  promotion  pro- 
grams and  import  restrictions. 

The  belief  in  the  need  to  promote  exports  was  strong  and  part 
of  Japan's  self-image  as  a  "processing  nation."  A  processing  na- 
tion must  import  raw  materials,  but  is  able  to  pay  for  the  imports 
by  adding  value  to  them  and  exporting  some  of  the  output.  Na- 
tions grow  stronger  economically  by  moving  up  the  industrial  lad- 
der to  produce  products  with  greater  value  added  to  the  basic  inputs. 
Rather  than  letting  markets  accomplish  this  movement  on  their 
own,  the  Japanese  government  felt  the  economy  should  be  guided 
in  this  direction  through  industrial  policy. 

Japan's  methods  of  promoting  exports  took  two  paths.  The  first 
was  to  develop  world-class  industries  that  could  initially  substitute 
for  imports  and  then  compete  in  international  markets.  The  sec- 
ond was  to  provide  incentives  for  firms  to  export. 

During  the  first  two  decades  after  World  War  II,  export  incen- 
tives took  the  form  of  a  combination  of  tax  relief  and  government 
assistance  to  build  export  industries.  After  joining  the  IMF  in  1964, 
however,  Japan  had  to  drop  its  major  export  incentive — the  total 
exemption  of  export  income  from  taxes — to  comply  with  IMF  proce- 
dures. It  did  maintain  into  the  1970s,  however,  special  tax  treat- 
ment of  costs  for  market  development  and  export  promotion. 

Once  chronic  trade  deficits  came  to  an  end  in  the  mid-1960s, 
the  need  for  export  promotion  policies  diminished.  Virtually  all 
export  tax  incentives  were  eliminated  over  the  course  of  the  1970s. 
Even  JETRO,  whose  initial  function  was  to  assist  smaller  firms 
with  overseas  marketing,  saw  its  role  shift  toward  import  promo- 
tion and  other  activities.  In  the  1980s,  Japan  continued  to  use  in- 
dustrial policy  to  promote  the  growth  of  new,  more  sophisticated 
industries,  but  direct  export  promotion  measures  were  no  longer 
part  of  the  policy  package. 

The  1970s  and  1980s  saw  the  emergence  of  policies  to  restrain 
exports  in  certain  industries.  The  great  success  of  some  Japanese 
export  industries  created  a  backlash  in  other  countries,  either  be- 
cause of  their  success  per  se  or  because  of  allegations  of  unfair 
competitive  practices.  Under  GATT  guidelines,  nations  have  been 


264 


International  Economic  Relations 


reluctant  to  raise  tariffs  or  impose  import  quotas — quotas  violate 
the  guidelines  and  raising  tariffs  goes  against  the  general  trend 
among  industrial  nations.  Instead,  they  have  resorted  to  convinc- 
ing the  exporting  country  to  "voluntarily"  restrain  exports  of  the 
offending  product.  In  the  1980s,  Japan  was  quite  willing  to  carry 
out  such  export  restraints.  Among  Japan's  exports  to  the  United 
States,  steel,  color  television  sets,  and  automobiles  all  were  sub- 
ject to  such  restraints  at  various  times. 

Import  Policies 

Japan  began  the  postwar  period  with  heavy  import  barriers.  Vir- 
tually all  products  were  subject  to  government  quotas,  many  faced 
high  tariffs,  and  MITI  had  authority  over  the  allocation  of  the  for- 
eign exchange  companies  needed  to  pay  for  any  import.  These  poli- 
cies were  justified  at  the  time  by  the  weakened  position  of  Japanese 
industry  and  the  country's  chronic  trade  deficits. 

By  the  late  1950s,  Japan's  international  trade  had  regained  its 
prewar  level,  and  its  balance  of  payments  displayed  sufficient 
strength  for  its  rigid  protectionism  to  be  increasingly  difficult  to 
justify.  The  IMF  and  GATT  strongly  pressured  Japan  to  free  its 
commerce  and  international  payments  system.  Beginning  in  the 
1960s,  the  government  adopted  a  policy  of  gradual  trade  liberali- 
zation, easing  import  quotas,  reducing  tariff  rates,  freeing  trans- 
actions in  foreign  exchange,  and  admitting  foreign  capital  into 
Japanese  industries,  which  has  continued  through  the  1980s. 

The  main  impetus  for  change  throughout  has  been  international 
obligation,  response  to  foreign,  rather  than  domestic,  pressure.  The 
result  has  been  a  prolonged,  reluctant  process  of  reducing  barriers, 
which  has  frustrated  many  of  Japan's  trading  partners. 

Japan  has  been  a  participant  in  the  major  rounds  of  tariff-cutting 
negotiations  under  the  GATT  framework — the  Kennedy  Round 
completed  in  1967,  the  Tokyo  Round  completed  in  1979,  and  the 
Uruguay  Round,  which  began  in  the  1980s  and  was  scheduled  for 
completion  in  1990.  As  a  result  of  these  agreements,  tariffs  in  Japan 
fell  to  a  low  level  on  average.  Upon  complete  implementation  of 
the  Tokyo  Round  agreement,  Japan  had  the  lowest  average  tariff 
level  among  industrial  countries — 2.5  percent,  compared  with  4.2 
percent  for  the  United  States  and  4.6  percent  for  the  European 
Community. 

Japan's  quotas  also  dropped.  From  490  items  under  quota  in 
1962,  Japan  had  only  27  items  under  quota  in  the  mid-1980s,  and 
that  number  dropped  again  late  in  the  decade  to  22  with  further 
agreements  scheduled  to  come  into  effect  in  the  early  1990s,  which 
would  reduce  the  number  again.  But  those  products  still  under 


265 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

quota  proved  to  be  highly  visible  and  were  the  object  of  complaints 
by  exporting  countries.  The  reduction  of  controlled  items  in  the 
late  1980s  resulted  from  Japan's  loss  of  a  GATT  case  brought  by 
the  United  States  concerning  import  restrictions  on  twelve  agricul- 
tural products.  In  addition,  heavy  pressure  from  the  United  States 
led  to  an  agreement  that  Japan  would  end  import  quotas  on  beef 
and  citrus  fruit  in  1991.  The  one  restricted  product  that  continued 
to  prompt  objections  from  other  countries  at  the  end  of  the  decade 
was  rice,  imports  of  which  were  prohibited.  Rice  has  traditionally 
been  the  mainstay  of  the  Japanese  diet,  and  farm  organizations 
have  played  upon  the  theme's  deep  cultural  importance  as  a  rea- 
son for  prohibiting  imports.  Farm  organizations  also  have  a  dis- 
proportionate political  voice  because  of  the  shift  of  the  population 
to  the  cities  without  any  significant  redistricting  for  seats  in  the 
Diet  (see  The  Electoral  System,  ch.  6).  Even  on  rice,  however,  it 
appeared  by  1990  that  political  forces  were  moving,  under  foreign 
pressure,  in  the  direction  of  a  gradually  opening  to  trade. 

Despite  Japan's  rather  good  record  on  tariffs  and  quotas,  it  con- 
tinued to  be  the  target  of  complaints  and  pressure  from  its  trading 
partners  during  the  1980s.  Many  complaints  revolved  around  non- 
tariff  barriers  other  than  quotas — standards,  testing  procedures, 
government  procurement,  and  other  policies  that  could  be  used 
to  restrain  imports.  These  barriers,  by  their  very  nature,  were  often 
difficult  to  document,  but  complaints  were  frequent. 

In  1984  the  United  States  government  initiated  intensive  talks 
with  Japan  on  four  product  areas:  forest  products,  telecommuni- 
cations equipment  and  services,  electronics,  and  pharmaceuticals 
and  medical  equipment.  The  Market  Oriented  Sector  Selective 
(MOSS)  talks  aimed  at  routing  out  all  overt  and  informal  barriers 
to  imports  in  these  areas.  The  negotiations  lasted  throughout  1985 
and  achieved  modest  success. 

Supporting  the  view  that  Japanese  markets  remained  difficult  to 
penetrate,  statistics  showed  that  the  level  of  manufactured  imports 
in  Japan  as  a  share  of  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary) 
was  still  far  below  the  level  in  other  developed  countries  during  the 
1980s.  Frustration  with  the  modest  results  of  the  MOSS  process  and 
similar  factors  led  to  provisions  in  the  United  States  Trade  Act  of 
1988  aimed  at  Japan.  Under  the  "Super  301"  provision,  na- 
tions were  to  be  named  as  unfair  trading  partners  and  specific 
products  chosen  for  negotiation,  as  appropriate,  with  retaliation 
against  the  exports  of  these  nations  should  negotiations  fail  to  provide 
satisfactory  results.  Japan  was  named  an  unfair  trading  nation  in 
1989,  and  negotiations  began  on  forest  products,  supercomputers, 


266 


International  Economic  Relations 


and  telecommunications  satellites  (see  United  States  and  Canada, 
this  ch.). 

By  the  end  of  the  1980s,  however,  some  internally  generated 
changes  in  import  policy  appeared  to  be  under  way  in  Japan.  The 
rapid  appreciation  of  the  yen  after  1985,  which  made  imports  more 
attractive,  stimulated  a  domestic  debate  over  nontariff  barriers  and 
other  structural  features  of  the  economy  impeding  imports.  Greater 
openness  in  policies  and  structures  began  to  be  sought  in  response 
to  domestic  pressures  rather  than  in  response  to  foreign  pressure 
and  international  obligation. 

External  pressure  for  change  also  increased  when  the  United 
States  initiated  a  series  of  bilateral  talks  in  1989  parallel  to  negoti- 
ations under  the  "Super  301"  provision.  These  new  talks,  known 
as  the  Structural  Impediments  Initiative,  focused  on  structural  fea- 
tures in  Japan  that  seemed  to  impede  imports  in  ways  outside  the 
normal  scope  of  trade  negotiations.  Issues  raised  in  the  Structural 
Impediments  Initiative,  and  by  the  Japanese  themselves  in  domestic 
discussions,  included  the  distribution  system  (in  which  manufac- 
turers continued  to  have  unusually  strong  control  over  wholesalers 
and  retailers  handling  their  products,  inhibiting  newcomers,  es- 
pecially foreign  ones)  and  investment  behavior  that  made  it  very 
difficult  for  foreign  firms  to  acquire  Japanese  firms.  These  discus- 
sions highlighted  some  of  the  fundamental  differences  in  the 
Japanese  and  United  States  economies,  but  how  quickly  change 
might  result  from  the  talks  was  unclear. 

Level  and  Commodity  Composition  of  Trade 
Exports 

Japanese  exports  grew  rapidly  in  the  1960s  and  1970s,  but  growth 
slowed  considerably  during  the  1980s.  Over  these  decades,  both 
the  composition  and  the  reputation  of  products  from  Japan  changed 
profoundly. 

Because  of  the  success  of  certain  exports,  Japan  was  often  viewed 
as  a  heavily  export-dependent  nation.  As  a  percentage  of  GNP, 
however,  the  country  exports  less  than  other  major  trading  coun- 
tries of  the  world.  In  1988,  for  example,  it  exported  9.3  percent 
of  its  GNP  compared  with  15.6  percent  for  Italy,  16.9  percent  for 
France,  17.8  percent  for  Britain,  24.4  percent  for  Canada,  26.8 
percent  for  West  Germany,  and  43.4  percent  for  the  Netherlands. 
The  United  States  exported  a  smaller  share  of  its  GNP  at  6.6 
percent.  Japan  was,  therefore,  less  dependent  on  foreign  trade  than 
many  other  industrialized  countries  of  the  world.  In  certain 
industries,  however,  export  dependence  was  high.  In  1988,  for 


267 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

example,  just  over  half  of  all  automobiles  produced  in  Japan  were 
exported. 

The  growth  of  Japanese  exports  during  the  1960s  and  1970s  was 
truly  phenomenal.  Beginning  in  1960  at  US$4.1  billion,  merchan- 
dise exports  grew  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  16.9  percent  in  the 
1960s  and  at  one  of  21  percent  in  the  1970s.  From  1981  to  1988, 
however,  export  growth  was  7.4  percent,  about  one-third  the  level 
of  the  1970s.  By  1988  merchandise  exports  reached  US$264.9  bil- 
lion (see  table  24,  Appendix). 

The  growth  in  exports  can  be  viewed  in  terms  of  both  pull  and 
push  factors.  The  pull  came  from  increasing  demand  for  Japanese 
products  as  the  United  States  and  other  foreign  markets  grew  and 
as  trade  barriers  in  major  market  countries  were  reduced.  Another 
pull  factor  was  the  price  competitiveness  of  Japanese  products.  From 
1960  to  1970,  Japan's  export  price  index  increased  by  only  4  per- 
cent, reflecting  the  high  rate  of  productivity  growth  in  the  manufac- 
turing industries  producing  export  products.  Inflation  was  higher 
in  the  1970s,  but  export  prices  were  still  only  45  percent  higher 
in  1980  than  in  1970  (growing  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  less 
than  4  percent),  considerably  lower  than  world  inflation.  The  1980s 
began  with  another  short  burst  of  inflation  because  of  oil  price  in- 
creases in  1979,  but  by  1988  Japanese  export  prices  were  actually 
23  percent  lower  than  in  1980,  offsetting  much  of  the  price  increase 
of  the  1980s.  This  record  enhanced  the  international  price  com- 
petitiveness of  Japanese  products. 

During  the  1950s,  Japanese  export  products  had  a  reputation 
for  poor  quality.  However,  this  image  changed  dramatically  dur- 
ing the  1970s.  Japanese  steel,  ships,  watches,  television  receivers, 
automobiles,  semiconductors,  and  many  other  goods  developed  a 
reputation  for  being  manufactured  to  high  standards  and  under 
strict  quality  control.  The  Japanese  were  the  acknowledged  world 
leaders  for  quality  and  design  in  the  1980s  for  some  of  these 
products.  This  rise  in  product  quality  also  increased  demand  for 
Japanese  exports. 

The  push  behind  Japan's  exports  came  from  manufacturers. 
Many  recognized  that  to  reach  efficient  levels  of  production  they 
needed  to  adopt  a  global  approach.  Manufacturers  concentrated 
on  the  domestic  market  (often  protected  from  foreign  products)  until 
they  reached  internationally  competitive  levels  and  domestic  mar- 
kets were  saturated.  Often  helped  by  the  large  general  trading  com- 
panies, manufacturers  aggressively  attacked  foreign  markets  when 
they  felt  able  to  compete  globally.  This  push  factor  partially  ac- 
counted for  the  extraordinarily  high  level  of  export  growth  in  the 
1970s,  when  the  domestic  economy  slowed;  increasing  exports  was 


268

a  way  for  manufacturers  to  continue  expanding  despite  the  more 
sluggish  domestic  market. 

Exports  included  a  wide  variety  of  products,  virtually  all  of  which 
were  processed  to  some  degree  (see  table  25;  table  26,  Appendix). 
After  the  war,  the  composition  of  exports  shifted  through  techno- 
logical progression.  Primary  products,  light  manufactures,  and 
crude  items,  which  predominated  during  the  1950s,  were  gradu- 
ally eclipsed  by  heavy  industrial  goods,  complex  machinery  and 
equipment,  and  consumer  durables,  which  required  large  capital 
investments  and  advanced  technology  to  produce.  This  process  was 
illustrated  vividly  in  the  case  of  textiles,  which  composed  more  than 
30  percent  of  Japanese  exports  in  1960,  but  less  than  3  percent  by 
1988.  Iron  and  steel  products,  which  grew  rapidly  in  the  1960s  to 
become  nearly  15  percent  of  exports  by  1970,  also  declined  to  less 
than  6  percent  of  exports  by  1988.  Over  the  same  period,  however, 
exports  of  motor  vehicles  rose  from  under  2  percent  to  over  18  per- 
cent of  the  total.  In  1988  Japan's  major  exports  were  motor  vehi- 
cles, office  machinery,  iron  and  steel,  semiconductors  and  other 
electronic  components,  and  scientific  and  optical  equipment. 

Imports 

During  the  1960s  and  1970s,  imports  grew  in  tandem  with 


269 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

exports,  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  15.4  percent  during  the  1960s 
and  22.2  percent  during  the  1970s.  In  a  sense,  import  growth  over 
much  of  this  period  was  constrained  by  exports  because  exports 
generated  the  foreign  exchange  to  purchase  the  imports.  During 
the  1980s,  however,  import  growth  lagged  far  behind  exports,  at 
an  average  annual  rate  of  only  2.9  percent  from  1981  to  1988.  This 
low  level  of  import  growth  led  to  the  large  trade  surpluses  that 
emerged  in  the  1980s. 

In  general,  Japan  has  not  imported  an  unusually  large  amount 
as  a  share  of  its  GNP,  but  it  has  been  highly  dependent  on  im- 
ports for  a  variety  of  critical  raw  materials.  Japan  has  by  no  means 
been  the  only  industrialized  nation  dependent  on  imported  raw 
materials,  but  it  has  depended  on  imports  for  a  wider  variety  of 
materials,  and  often  for  a  higher  share  of  its  needs  for  these  materi- 
als. The  country  imported,  for  example,  50  percent  of  its  caloric 
intake  of  food  and  about  30  percent  of  the  total  value  of  food  con- 
sumed in  the  late  1980s.  It  also  depended  on  imports  for  about 
85  percent  of  its  total  energy  needs  (including  all  of  its  petroleum 
and  89  percent  of  its  coal)  and  nearly  all  of  its  iron,  copper,  and 
lead  ore  and  nickel. 

The  long-term  growth  in  imports  was  facilitated  by  several  major 
factors.  The  most  important  was  general  growth  in  the  Japanese 
economy  and  income  levels.  Rising  real  incomes  increased  demand 
for  imports,  both  those  consumed  directly  and  those  entering  into 
production.  Another  factor  was  the  shift  in  the  economy  toward 
greater  reliance  on  imported  raw  materials.  Primary  energy  sources 
in  the  late  1940s,  for  example,  were  domestic  coal  and  charcoal. 
The  shift  to  imported  oil  and  coal  as  major  energy  sources  did  not 
come  until  the  late  1950s  and  1960s.  The  small  size  and  poor  quality 
of  many  of  the  mineral  deposits  in  Japan,  combined  with  innova- 
tions in  ocean  transportation,  such  as  bulk  ore  carriers,  meant  that 
as  the  economy  grew,  demand  outstripped  domestic  supply  and 
cheaper  imports  were  utilized. 

The  price  of  imports  was  also  a  factor  in  their  growth.  In  1973 
Japan's  import  price  index  was  at  essentially  the  same  level  as  in 
1955,  partly  because  of  the  appreciation  of  the  yen  after  1971 ,  which 
reduced  the  yen  price  of  imports,  but  also  because  of  the  reduced 
costs  of  ocean  shipping  and  stable  prices  for  food  and  raw  materi- 
als. For  the  rest  of  the  1970s,  however,  import  prices  skyrocketed, 
climbing  219  percent  from  1973  to  1980.  This  dramatic  price  rise, 
especially  for  petroleum  but  by  no  means  confined  to  it,  was  respon- 
sible for  the  rapid  growth  of  the  dollar  value  of  imports  during  the 
1970s,  despite  the  slower  growth  of  the  economy.  During  the  1980s, 
import  prices  fell  again,  especially  for  petroleum,  dropping  by  44 


270 


International  Economic  Relations 


percent  from  1980  to  1988.  Reflecting  these  price  movements,  the 
dollar  value  of  petroleum  imports  rose  from  about  US$2.8  billion 
in  1970  to  nearly  US$58  billion  in  1980,  and  then  fell  by  half,  to 
less  than  US$26  billion  by  1988  (see  table  27;  table  28,  Appendix). 

A  third  factor  affecting  imports  was  trade  liberalization.  Reduced 
tariff  rates  and  a  weakening  of  other  overt  trade  barriers  meant 
that  imports  should  have  been  able  to  compete  more  fully  in  Japan's 
markets.  The  extent  to  which  this  was  true,  however,  was  subject 
to  much  debate  among  analysts.  The  share  of  manufactured  im- 
ports in  the  GNP  changed  very  little  from  1970  to  1985,  suggest- 
ing that  falling  import  barriers  had  little  impact  on  the  propensity 
to  purchase  foreign  products.  Falling  trade  barriers  might  become 
more  significant  in  the  1990s  as  liberalization  continues. 

Yet  another  factor  determining  import  levels  was  the  exchange 
rate.  After  the  ending  of  the  Bretton  Woods  System  in  1971,  the 
yen  appreciated  against  the  dollar  and  other  currencies.  The  ap- 
preciation of  the  yen  made  imports  less  expensive  to  Japan,  but 
it  had  a  complex  effect  on  total  imports.  Demand  for  raw  material 
imports  was  not  affected  much  by  price  changes  (at  least  in  the 
short  run).  Demand  for  manufactured  goods,  however,  was  more 
responsive  to  price  changes.  Much  of  the  rapid  increase  in  imports 
of  manufactures  after  1985,  when  the  yen  began  to  appreciate  rap- 
idly, can  be  attributed  to  this  exchange  rate  effect. 

All  factors  combined  led  to  the  rapid  growth  of  imports  in  the 
1960s  and  1970s  and  their  very  slow  growth  in  the  1980s.  Rapid 
economic  growth  combined  with  stable  import  prices  and  the  shift 
toward  imported  raw  materials  brought  high  import  growth  in  the 
1960s.  The  big  jump  in  raw  material  prices  in  the  1970s  kept  im- 
port growth  high  despite  lower  economic  growth.  In  the  1980s,  fall- 
ing raw  material  prices,  a  relatively  weak  yen,  and  continued  modest 
economic  growth  kept  import  growth  low  in  the  first  half  of  the 
decade.  Import  growth  finally  accelerated  in  the  second  half  of  the 
1980s,  when  raw  material  prices  stopped  falling  and  as  the  rise  in 
the  value  of  the  yen  encouraged  manufactured  imports. 

Japan  imported  a  wide  range  of  products,  although  energy 
sources,  raw  materials,  and  food  were  the  major  items.  Mineral 
fuels,  for  example,  rose  from  under  17  percent  of  all  imports  in 
1960  to  a  high  of  nearly  50  percent  in  1980.  They  had  declined 
to  under  21  percent  by  1988.  These  shifts  show  the  enormous  im- 
pact of  price  changes  on  imports.  Swings  in  imports  of  other  raw 
materials  were  far  less  dramatic,  and  many  declined  over  time  as 
a  share  of  total  imports.  Metal  ores  and  scrap,  for  example,  declined 
steadily  from  15  percent  in  1960  to  less  than  5  percent  in  1988, 
reflecting  the  changing  structure  of  the  economy,  which  moved  away 


271 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

from  basic  metal  manufactures  to  higher  value-added  industries. 
Textile  materials  also  dropped  from  1 7  percent  of  total  imports  in 
1960  to  under  2  percent  in  1988,  as  the  textile  industry  became 
less  important  and  imports  of  finished  textiles  increased.  Foodstuffs, 
on  the  other  hand,  were  relatively  steady  as  a  share  of  imports, 
rising  from  just  over  12  percent  in  1960  to  less  than  16  percent 
in  1988. 

Manufactured  goods — chemicals,  machinery  and  equipment,  and 
miscellaneous  commodities — gained  as  a  share  of  imports,  but  the 
variation  among  them  was  considerable.  Manufactures  were  about 
22  percent  of  total  imports  in  1960,  remained  at  just  under  23  per- 
cent in  1980,  and  then  expanded  to  49  percent  by  1988.  Imports 
of  textiles,  nonferrous  metals,  and  iron  and  steel  products  all  showed 
significant  gains,  for  the  same  reasons  that  the  raw  material  im- 
ports to  produce  them  had  declined.  However,  chemical  and  ma- 
chinery and  equipment  imports  showed  little  increase  in  share  until 
after  1985. 

The  heavy  dependency  on  raw  materials  that  characterized  Japan 
until  the  mid-1980s  reflected  both  their  absence  in  Japan  and  the 
process  of  import- substitution  in  which  Japan  favored  domestic  in- 
dustries over  imports.  The  desire  to  restrict  manufactured  imports 
was  intensified  by  the  knowledge  that  the  nation  needed  strong 
manufacturing  industries  to  generate  exports  to  pay  for  needed  raw 
material  imports.  Only  with  the  appreciation  of  the  yen  after  1985, 
and  the  drop  in  petroleum  and  other  raw  material  prices,  did  this 
sense  of  vulnerability  ease.  These  trends  were  reflected  in  the  ris- 
ing share  of  manufactures  in  imports  in  the  late  1980s. 

Balance  of  Merchandise  Trade 

Between  1960  and  1964,  Japan  incurred  annual  trade  deficits 
(based  on  a  customs  clearance  for  imports)  ranging  from  US$0.4 
billion  to  US$1.6  billion.  The  era  of  chronic  trade  deficit  ended 
in  1965,  and  by  1969,  with  a  positive  balance  of  almost  US$1  bil- 
lion, Japan  was  widely  regarded  as  a  surplus  trading  nation.  In 

1971  the  surplus  reached  US$4  billion,  and  its  rapid  increase  was 
a  main  factor  behind  the  United  States  decision  to  devalue  the  dollar 
and  pressure  Japan  to  revalue  the  yen — events  that  led  quickly  to 
the  end  of  the  Bretton  Woods  System  of  fixed  exchange  rates.  By 

1972  Japan's  surplus  had  climbed  to  US$5  billion,  despite  the 
revaluation  of  the  yen  in  1971. 

The  jump  in  prices  of  petroleum  and  other  raw  materials  dur- 
ing 1973  plunged  the  balance  of  trade  into  deficit,  and  in  1974  the 
deficit  reached  US$6.6  billion.  With  strong  export  growth,  however, 
this  was  reversed  to  a  surplus  of  US$2.4  billion  by  1976.  The  surplus 


272 


International  Economic  Relations 


reached  a  record  US$18.2  billion  in  1978,  promoting  considerable 
tension  between  the  United  States  and  Japan. 

In  1979  petroleum  prices  jumped  again,  and  Japan's  trade 
balance  again  turned  to  deficit,  reaching  US$10.7  billion  in  1980. 
Once  again  rapid  export  growth  and  stagnant  imports  returned 
Japan  quickly  to  surplus  by  1981.  From  that  time  through  1986, 
Japan's  trade  surplus  grew  explosively,  to  a  peak  of  US$82.7  bil- 
lion. This  unprecedented  trade  surplus  resulted  from  the  moderate 
annual  rise  in  exports  and  drop  in  imports  noted  above.  Under- 
lying these  trade  developments  was  the  weakness  of  the  yen  against 
other  currencies,  which  enhanced  export  price  competitiveness  and 
dampened  import  demand. 

After  1986  the  dollar  value  of  Japan's  trade  surplus  declined, 
to  US$77.6  billion  in  1988.  This  decline  came  as  the  yen  finally 
appreciated  strongly  against  the  dollar  (beginning  in  1985)  and  as 
a  rapid  rise  in  manufactured  imports  began  to  offset  the  large  drop 
in  the  value  of  raw  material  imports.  Nevertheless,  the  surplus 
showed  surprising  resilience  in  the  face  of  the  strengthening  of  the 
yen. 

Underlying  trends  throughout  the  1970s  and  1980s  was  the  fun- 
damental strength  of  Japan's  export  sector.  Under  the  fixed  ex- 
change rates  of  the  1960s,  exports  became  progressively  more 
competitive  on  world  markets,  lifting  the  country  out  of  the  per- 
sistent trade  deficits  that  had  continued  into  the  early  years  of  the 
decade.  During  the  1970s,  rapid  export  expansion  extricated  the 
country  from  the  deficits  immediately  following  the  two  oil  price 
shocks  of  1973  and  1979.  Continuing  export  strength  then  drove 
the  nation  to  the  extraordinary  trade  surpluses  of  the  1980s,  as  the 
temporary  burden  of  costly  oil  imports  waned. 

Japan's  fundamental  strength  in  world  markets  required  its  fear 
of  vulnerability  and  opposition  to  manufactured  imports  to  be  re- 
assessed. In  the  early  1980s,  fear  of  vulnerability  remained  strong 
and  fed  the  continuation  of  policies  and  behavior  that  kept  manufac- 
tured imports  unusually  low  compared  with  those  of  other  indus- 
trial nations.  Only  with  the  large  decline  in  raw  material  prices 
and  the  explosion  of  trade  surpluses  did  policies  and  behavior  begin 
to  change.  These  changes  would  not  necessarily  bring  down  the 
trade  surplus,  but  would  help  diminish  tension  between  Japan  and 
its  trading  partners. 

Balance  of  Payments  Accounts 

Services  and  the  Current  Account 

Japan  has  traditionally  run  a  deficit  in  services.  Trade  in  services 
includes  transportation  (freight  and  passenger  fares),  insurance,  travel 


273 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

expenditures,  royalties,  licensing  fees,  and  income  from  invest- 
ments. The  steadily  rising  deficit  in  services  from  1960  through 
1980,  from  US$99  million  in  1960,  to  nearly  US$1.8  billion  in  1970 
and  to  more  than  US$11  billion  in  1980,  can  be  attributed  to  ris- 
ing royalty  and  licensing  payments  for  Japan's  acquisition  of  tech- 
nology from  other  industrial  countries  and  to  rising  deficits  in  the 
trade-related  services  of  transportation  and  insurance.  The  trans- 
portation deficit  rose  after  the  1960s,  as  rapidly  climbing  labor  costs 
made  Japanese-flag  vessels  less  competitive,  leading  to  greater  use 
of  foreign-flag  carriers  (including  many  flag-of-convenience  ves- 
sels actually  owned  by  Japanese  interests). 

Beginning  in  the  late  1970s,  however,  rapidly  growing  overseas 
investments  began  to  increase  the  inflow  of  investment  income. 
The  investments  themselves  are  part  of  capital  flows  in  the  balance 
of  payments,  but  repatriation  of  earnings  on  those  investments  is 
part  of  the  services  account.  From  a  small  surplus  of  US$900  mil- 
lion in  1978,  the  balance  on  investment  income  (earnings  from 
abroad  minus  the  earnings  of  foreigners  in  Japan)  grew  to  US$21 
billion  by  1988.  The  tremendous  growth  in  Japanese  investments 
abroad  had  not  been  matched  by  any  such  growth  of  foreign  in- 
vestment in  Japan. 

Despite  the  rapid  growth  in  Japan's  investment  income  surplus, 
the  country's  total  services  account  remained  in  deficit  in  the  1980s. 
It  did  diminish  in  the  first  half  of  the  decade,  but  then  total  deficits 
increased  again,  from  US$4.9  billion  in  1986  to  nearly  US$11.2 
billion  in  1988.  Offsetting  the  rising  surpluses  in  investment  in- 
come were  an  enormous  jump  in  the  deficit  on  overseas  travel  and 
purchases  by  Japanese  citizens  while  abroad.  The  net  balance  on 
passenger  transportation  deteriorated  from  a  net  deficit  of  US$1.3 
billion  in  1985  to  US$3.7  billion  by  1988,  and  foreign  travel  and 
spending  (purchases  of  goods  and  services  by  individuals  while 
abroad)  increased  from  US$3.7  billion  to  US$15.8  billion  over  the 
same  short  time.  This  burst  of  overseas  travel  and  spending  came 
as  the  movement  in  the  exchange  rate  made  foreign  travel  more 
attractive  to  the  Japanese.  It  also  reflected  the  rising  perception 
among  Japanese  consumers  that  prices  for  a  wide  range  of  manufac- 
tured items  were  substantially  lower  abroad  than  at  home,  giving 
them  an  incentive  to  purchase  these  items  while  out  of  their  coun- 
try. By  the  end  of  the  decade,  the  number  of  Japanese  taking  over- 
seas trips  approached  10  million  annually. 

One  other  nonmerchandise  transaction  is  included  in  the  cur- 
rent account  balance — net  transfers.  These  represent  the  flow  of 
foreign  aid  from  Japan.  As  the  country  supplied  more  foreign  aid, 
the  deficit  in  this  account  rose.  Much  of  the  change  occurred  in 
the  1980s,  with  the  deficit  growing  from  US$1.5  billion  in  1980 


274 


7T 


to  US$4.1  billion  by  1988.  It  was  expected  to  grow  further,  with 
Japan's  foreign  aid  expanding  in  the  1990s. 

Adding  net  exports  of  services  and  net  transfers  to  the  merchan- 
dise trade  balance,  with  imports  measured  free  on  board  (f.o.b.), 
rather  than  as  customs,  insurance,  and  freight  (c.i.f.),  gives  the 
balance  on  current  account.  Movements  in  Japan's  current  account 
balance  have  generally  mirrored  those  of  the  merchandise  trade 
balance  considered  above,  although  deficits  in  services  and  net  trans- 
fers have  offset  the  surpluses  somewhat.  Japan  began  to  register 
surpluses  in  the  current  account  in  1965,  which  later  continued 
to  rise,  though  they  were  punctuated  by  short-term  deficits  following 
the  two  oil  price  hikes  in  1973  and  1979. 

During  the  1980s  Japan's  current  account  balance  shot  from  a 
record  deficit  of  US$10.7  billion  in  1980  to  a  record  surplus  of 
US$87  billion  in  1987.  As  a  share  of  GNP,  this  surplus  reached 
a  peak  of  4.4  percent  in  1985,  a  large  value  for  a  current  account 
surplus.  The  appreciation  of  the  yen  against  the  dollar  and  other 
currencies  beginning  in  1985  was  slow  to  have  any  impact  on  the 
dollar  value  of  the  current  account  surplus,  although  it  did  decline 
by  US$8  billion  in  1988. 

Capital  Flows 

Capital  movements  offset  the  surpluses  or  deficits  in  the  current 
account.  A  current  account  surplus,  for  example,  implies  that  rather 


275 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

than  using  all  the  foreign  currency  earned  by  selling  exports  to  buy 
imports,  corporations  and  individuals  chose  to  invest  the  money 
in  foreign-currency-denominated  assets  instead.  As  measured  in 
Japan's  balance  of  payments  data,  capital  movements  consist  of 
long-  and  short-term  investments,  and  movements  in  official  for- 
eign exchange  reserves  and  private  bank  accounts.  Capital  move- 
ments include  loans,  portfolio  investments  in  corporate  stock,  and 
direct  investment  (establishment  or  purchase  of  subsidiaries  abroad). 
A  capital  outflow  occurs  when  a  Japanese  individual  or  corpora- 
tion makes  a  loan,  buys  foreign  stock,  or  establishes  a  subsidiary 
abroad.  A  capital  inflow  occurs  when  foreigners  engage  in  these 
operations  in  Japan. 

After  World  War  II,  Japan's  return  to  world  capital  markets 
as  a  borrower  was  slow  and  deliberate.  Even  before  the  war,  Japan 
did  not  participate  in  world  capital  markets  to  the  same  extent  as 
the  United  States  or  West  European  countries.  Caution  and  con- 
trol remained  strong  until  well  into  the  1970s,  when  the  nation  was 
no  longer  a  net  debtor.  Since  that  time,  deregulation  has  proceeded 
steadily  and  capital  flows  have  grown  rapidly.  The  rapid  growth 
of  investment  abroad  in  the  1980s  had  made  Japan  the  largest  net 
investor  in  the  world  by  the  end  of  the  decade. 

As  might  be  expected  of  a  country  recovering  from  a  major  war- 
time defeat,  Japan  remained  a  net  debtor  nation  until  the  mid- 
1960s,  although  it  was  never  as  far  in  debt  as  many  of  the  more 
recently  developing  countries.  By  1967,  however,  Japanese  invest- 
ments overseas  had  begun  to  exceed  foreign  investments  in  Japan, 
changing  Japan  from  a  net  debtor  to  a  net  creditor  nation.  The 
country  remained  a  modest  net  creditor  until  the  1980s,  when  its 
creditor  position  expanded  explosively,  altering  Japan's  relation- 
ship to  the  rest  of  the  world. 

In  the  Japanese  balance  of  payments  data,  these  changes  are  most 
readily  seen  in  the  long-term  capital  account.  During  the  first  half 
of  the  1960s,  this  account  generally  showed  small  net  inflows  of 
capital  (as  did  the  short-term  capital  account).  From  1965  on, 
however,  the  long-term  capital  account  consistently  showed  an  out- 
flow, ranging  from  US$1  billion  to  US$12  billion  during  the  1970s. 
The  sharp  shift  in  the  balance  of  payments  brought  about  by  the 
oil  price  hike  at  the  decade's  end  produced  an  unusual  net  inflow 
of  long-term  capital  in  1980  of  US$2.3  billion,  but  thereafter  the 
outflow  resumed  and  grew  enormously.  From  nearly  US$10  bil- 
lion in  1981,  the  annual  net  outflow  of  long-term  capital  reached 
nearly  US$137  billion  in  1987  and  then  dropped  slightly,  to  just 
over  US$130  billion,  in  1988  (see  table  29,  Appendix).

Short-term  capital  flows  in  the  balance  of  payments  do  not  show 
so  clear  a  picture.  These  more  volatile  flows  have  generally  added 
to  the  net  capital  outflow,  but  in  some  years  movements  in  inter- 
national differentials  in  interest  rates  or  other  factors  led  to  a  net 
inflow  of  short-term  capital. 

The  other  significant  part  of  capital  flows  in  the  balance  of  pay- 
ments is  the  movement  in  gold  and  foreign  exchange  reserves  held 
by  the  government,  which  represent  the  funds  held  by  the  Bank 
of  Japan  to  intervene  in  foreign  exchange  markets  to  affect  the  value 
of  the  yen.  In  the  1970s,  the  size  of  these  markets  became  so  large 
that  any  government  intervention  was  only  a  small  share  of  total 
transactions,  but  Japan  and  other  governments  used  their  reserves 
to  influence  exchange  rates  when  necessary.  In  the  second  half  of 
the  1970s,  for  example,  foreign  exchange  reserves  rose  rapidly,  from 
a  total  of  US$12.8  billion  in  1975  to  US$33  billion  by  1978,  as 
the  Bank  of  Japan  sold  yen  to  buy  dollars  in  foreign  exchange  mar- 
kets to  slow  or  stop  the  rise  in  the  yen's  value,  fearful  that  such 
a  rise  would  adversely  affect  Japanese  exports.  The  same  opera- 
tion occurred  on  a  much  larger  scale  after  1985.  From  US$26.5 
billion  in  1985  (a  level  little  changed  from  the  decade's  beginning), 
exchange  reserves  had  climbed  to  almost  US$98  billion  by  1988. 
This  intervention  was  similarly  inspired  by  concern  about  the  yen's 
high  value. 

The  combination  of  net  outflows  of  long-  and  short-term  capital 
and  rising  holdings  of  foreign  exchange  by  the  central  government 
produced  enormous  change  in  Japan's  accumulated  holdings  of  for- 
eign assets,  compared  to  foreigners'  holdings  of  assets  in  Japan. 
As  a  result,  from  a  net  asset  position  of  US$11.5  billion  in  1980 
(meaning  that  Japanese  investors  held  US$1 1.5  billion  more  in  for- 
eign assets  than  foreigners  held  in  Japan),  Japan's  international 
net  assets  had  grown  to  nearly  US$292  billion  by  1988  (see  table 
30,  Appendix).  Japanese  assets  abroad  grew  from  nearly  US$160 
billion  in  1980  to  almost  US$1.5  trillion  by  1988,  a  ninefold  in- 
crease. Liabilities — investments  by  foreigners  in  Japan — expanded 
somewhat  more  slowly,  about  sevenfold,  from  US$148  billion  in 
1980  to  US$1 . 1  trillion  in  1988.  Dramatic  shifts  were  seen  in  port- 
folio securities  purchases — stocks  and  bonds — in  both  directions. 
Japanese  purchases  of  foreign  securities  went  from  only  US$4.2 
billion  in  1976  to  over  US$21  billion  in  1980  and  to  US$427  bil- 
lion by  1988.  Although  foreign  purchases  of  Japanese  securities 
also  expanded,  the  growth  was  much  slower,  and  the  total  was  still 
under  US$255  billion  in  1988. 

Capital  flows  have  been  heavily  affected  by  government  policy. 
During  the  1950s  and  the  first  half  of  the  1960s,  when  Japan  faced 


277 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

chronic  current  account  deficits,  concern  over  maintaining  a  high 
credit  rating  in  international  capital  markets  and  fear  of  having 
to  devalue  the  currency  and  of  foreign  ownership  of  Japanese  com- 
panies all  led  to  tight  controls  over  both  inflow  and  outflow  of  cap- 
ital. As  part  of  these  controls,  for  example,  government  severely 
restricted  foreign  direct  investment  in  Japan,  but  encouraged  licens- 
ing agreements  with  foreign  firms  to  obtain  access  to  their  tech- 
nology. As  Japan's  current  account  position  strengthened  in  the 
1960s,  however,  the  nation  came  under  increasing  pressure  to  liber- 
alize its  tight  controls. 

When  Japan  became  a  member  of  the  OECD  in  1966,  it  also 
had  to  agree  to  liberalize  its  capital  markets.  This  process  began 
in  1967  and  continued  in  the  early  1990s.  Decontrol  of  interna- 
tional capital  flows  was  aided  in  1980,  when  the  new  Foreign  Ex- 
change and  Foreign  Control  Law  went  into  effect.  In  principle, 
all  external  economic  transactions  were  free  of  control,  unless  speci- 
fied otherwise.  In  practice,  a  wide  range  of  transactions  continued 
to  be  subject  to  some  form  of  formal  or  informal  control  by  the 
government. 

Because  of  continuing  capital  controls,  negotiations  between 
Japan  and  the  United  States  were  held,  producing  an  agreement 
in  1984,  the  Yen-Dollar  Accord.  This  agreement  led  to  additional 
liberalizing  measures  that  were  implemented  over  the  next  several 
years.  Many  of  these  changes  concerned  the  establishment  and  func- 
tioning of  markets  for  financial  instruments  in  Japan  (such  as  a 
short-term  treasury  bill  market)  rather  than  the  removal  of  inter- 
national capital  controls  per  se.  This  approach  was  taken  because 
of  American  concerns  that  foreign  investment  in  Japan  was  impeded 
by  a  lack  of  various  financial  instruments  in  the  country  and  by 
the  government's  continued  control  of  interest  rates  for  many  of 
those  instruments  that  did  exist.  As  a  result  of  the  agreement,  for 
example,  interest  rates  on  large  bank  deposits  were  decontrolled, 
and  the  minimum  denomination  for  certificates  of  deposit  was 
lowered. 

By  the  end  of  the  1980s,  barriers  to  capital  flow  were  no  longer 
a  major  issue  in  United  States-Japan  relations.  However,  im- 
balances in  the  flows  and  in  accumulated  totals  of  capital  invest- 
ment, with  Japan  becoming  a  large  world  creditor,  were  emerging 
as  new  areas  of  tension.  This  tension  was  exacerbated  by  the  fact 
that  the  United  States  became  the  world's  largest  net  debtor  at  the 
same  time  that  Japan  became  its  largest  net  creditor.  Neverthe- 
less, no  policy  decisions  had  been  made  by  the  end  of  the  1980s 
that  would  restrict  the  flow  of  Japanese  capital  to  the  United  States. 


278 


International  Economic  Relations 


One  important  area  of  capital  flows  is  direct  investment — outright 
ownership  or  control  (as  opposed  to  portfolio  investment).  Japan's 
direct  foreign  investment  has  grown  rapidly,  although  not  as  dra- 
matically as  portfolio  investment.  Data  collected  by  its  Ministry 
of  Finance  show  the  accumulated  value  of  Japanese  foreign  direct 
investment  growing  from  under  US$3.6  billion  in  1970  to  US$36.5 
billion  in  1980  and  to  over  US$186  billion  by  1988  (see  table  31, 
Appendix).  Direct  investment  tends  to  be  very  visible,  and  the  rapid 
increase  of  Japan's  direct  investments  in  countries  such  as  the 
United  States,  combined  with  the  large  imbalance  between  Japan's 
overseas  investment  and  foreign  investment  in  Japan  was  a  primary 
cause  of  tension  at  the  end  of  the  1980s. 

The  location  of  Japan's  direct  investments  abroad  has  been  shift- 
ing. In  1970,  21  percent  of  its  investments  were  in  Asia  and  nearly 
22  percent  in  the  United  States.  By  1988,  the  share  of  investments 
in  Asia  had  dropped  slightly,  to  under  18  percent,  while  that  in 
the  United  States  had  risen  sharply,  to  nearly  39  percent  of  the 
total.  During  this  period,  Japan's  share  of  investments  in  Latin 
America  held  rather  steady  (from  nearly  16  percent  in  1970  to  nearly 

17  percent  in  1988),  as  it  did  in  Europe  (down  slightly  from  nearly 

18  percent  to  over  16  percent  in  that  period),  and  Africa  (where 
it  was  under  3  percent  in  both  years).  Both  the  Middle  East  (down 
from  over  9  percent  to  under  2  percent)  and  the  Pacific  (down  from 
roughly  8  percent  to  5  percent)  became  relatively  less  important 
locations  for  Japanese  investments.  However,  because  of  the  rapid 
growth  in  the  dollar  amounts  of  the  investments,  these  shifts  were 
all  relative.  Even  in  the  Middle  East,  the  dollar  value  of  Japanese 
investments  had  grown. 

The  drive  to  invest  overseas  stemmed  from  several  motives.  A 
major  reason  for  many  early  investments  was  to  obtain  access  to 
raw  materials.  As  Japan  became  more  dependent  on  imported  raw 
materials,  energy,  and  food  during  the  1960s  and  1970s,  direct  in- 
vestments were  one  way  of  ensuring  supply.  The  Middle  East,  Aus- 
tralia, and  some  Asian  countries  (such  as  Indonesia)  were  major 
locations  for  such  investments  by  1970.  Second,  rising  labor  costs 
during  the  1960s  and  1970s  led  certain  labor-intensive  industries, 
especially  textiles,  to  move  abroad. 

Investment  in  other  industrial  countries,  such  as  the  United 
States,  was  often  motivated  by  barriers  to  exports  from  Japan.  The 
restrictions  on  automobile  exports  to  the  United  States,  which  went 
into  effect  in  1981,  became  a  primary  motivation  for  Japanese  auto- 
makers to  establish  assembly  plants  in  the  United  States.  The  same 
situation  had  occurred  earlier,  in  the  1970s,  for  plants  manufac- 
turing television  sets.  Japanese  firms  exporting  from  developing 


279 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

countries,  moreover,  often  received  preferential  tariff  treatment  in 
developed  countries  (under  the  Generalized  System  of  Preferences). 
In  short,  protectionism  in  developed  countries  often  motivated 
Japanese  foreign  direct  investment. 

After  1985,  a  new  and  important  incentive  materialized  for  such 
investments.  The  rapid  rise  in  the  value  of  the  yen  seriously  under- 
mined the  international  competitiveness  of  many  products  manufac- 
tured in  Japan.  While  this  situation  had  been  true  for  textiles  in 
the  1960s,  it  now  also  affected  a  much  wider  range  of  more  sophisti- 
cated products.  Japanese  manufacturers  began  actively  seeking 
lower  cost  production  bases.  This  factor,  rather  than  any  increase 
in  foreign  protectionism,  appeared  to  lie  behind  the  acceleration 
of  overseas  investments  after  1985. 

This  cost  disadvantage  also  led  more  Japanese  firms  to  think  of 
their  overseas  factories  as  a  source  of  products  for  the  Japanese 
market  itself.  Except  for  the  basic  processing  of  raw  materials, 
manufacturers  had  previously  regarded  foreign  investments  as  a 
substitute  for  exports  rather  than  as  an  overseas  base  for  home  mar- 
kets. The  share  of  output  from  Japanese  factories  in  the  lower- wage- 
cost  countries  of  Asia  that  was  destined  for  the  Japanese  market 
(rather  than  for  local  markets  or  for  export)  rose  from  10  percent 
in  1980  to  16  percent  in  1987. 

The  Value  of  the  Yen 

The  relative  value  of  the  yen  is  determined  in  foreign  exchange 
markets  by  the  forces  of  demand  and  supply.  The  demand  for  the 
yen  is  governed  by  the  desire  of  foreigners  to  buy  goods  and  ser- 
vices in  Japan  and  by  their  interest  in  investing  in  Japan  (buying 
yen-denominated  real  and  financial  assets).  The  supply  of  the  yen 
in  the  market  is  governed  by  the  desire  of  yen  holders  to  exchange 
their  yen  for  other  currencies  to  purchase  goods,  services,  or  assets. 

In  1949  the  value  of  the  yen  was  set  at  ¥360  per  US$1  through 
an  American  plan,  which  was  part  of  the  Bretton  Woods  System, 
to  stabilize  prices  in  the  Japanese  economy.  That  exchange  rate 
was  maintained  until  1971 ,  when  the  United  States  abandoned  the 
convertibility  of  the  dollar  to  gold,  which  had  been  a  key  element 
of  the  Bretton  Woods  System,  and  imposed  a  10  percent  surcharge 
on  imports,  and  set  in  motion  changes  that  eventually  led  to  float- 
ing exchange  rates  in  1973. 

By  1971  the  yen  had  become  undervalued  (see  table  32,  Appen- 
dix). Japanese  exports  were  costing  too  little  in  international  mar- 
kets, and  imports  from  abroad  were  costing  the  Japanese  too  much. 
This  undervaluation  was  reflected  in  the  current  account  balance, 
which  had  risen  from  the  deficits  of  the  early  1960s  to  a  then-large 


280 


International  Economic  Relations 

surplus  of  US$5.8  billion  in  1971 .  The  belief  that  the  yen,  and  sev- 
eral other  major  currencies,  were  undervalued  motivated  the  United 
States  actions  in  1971. 

Following  the  United  States  measures  to  devalue  the  dollar  in 
the  summer  of  1971,  the  Japanese  government  agreed  to  a  new, 
fixed  exchange  rate  as  part  of  the  Smithsonian  Agreement,  signed 
at  the  end  of  the  year.  This  agreement  set  the  exchange  rate  at 
¥308  per  US$1 .  However,  the  new  fixed  rates  of  the  Smithsonian 
Agreement  were  difficult  to  maintain  in  the  face  of  supply  and  de- 
mand pressures  in  the  foreign  exchange  market.  In  early  1973,  the 
rates  were  abandoned,  and  the  major  nations  of  the  world  allowed 
their  currencies  to  float. 

In  the  1970s,  Japanese  government  and  business  people  were 
very  concerned  that  a  rise  in  the  value  of  the  yen  would  hurt  ex- 
port growth  by  making  Japanese  products  less  competitive  and 
would  damage  the  industrial  base.  The  government,  therefore,  con- 
tinued to  intervene  heavily  in  foreign  exchange  marketing  (buy- 
ing or  selling  dollars),  even  after  the  1973  decision  to  allow  the  yen 
to  float. 

Despite  intervention,  market  pressures  caused  the  yen  to  con- 
tinue climbing  in  value,  peaking  temporarily  at  an  average  of  ¥271 
per  US$1  in  1973  before  the  impact  of  the  oil  crisis  was  felt.  The 
increased  costs  of  imported  oil  caused  the  yen  to  depreciate  to  a 
range  of  ¥290  to  ¥300  between  1974  and  1976.  The  reemergence 
of  trade  surpluses  drove  the  yen  back  up  to  ¥211  in  1978.  This 
currency  strengthening  was  again  reversed  by  the  second  oil  shock, 
with  the  yen  dropping  to  ¥227  by  1980. 

During  the  first  half  of  the  1980s,  the  yen  failed  to  rise  in  value 
even  though  current  account  surpluses  returned  and  grew  quickly. 
From  ¥221  in  1981 ,  the  average  value  of  the  yen  actually  dropped 
to  ¥239  in  1985.  The  rise  in  the  current  account  surplus  gener- 
ated stronger  demand  for  yen  in  foreign  exchange  markets,  but 
this  trade-related  demand  for  yen  was  offset  by  other  factors.  A 
wide  differential  in  interest  rates,  with  United  States  interest  rates 
much  higher  than  those  in  Japan,  and  the  continuing  moves  to 
deregulate  the  international  flow  of  capital,  led  to  a  large  net  out- 
flow of  capital  from  Japan.  This  capital  flow  increased  the  supply 
of  yen  in  foreign  exchange  markets,  as  Japanese  investors  changed 
their  yen  for  other  currencies  (mainly  dollars)  to  invest  overseas. 
This  situation  kept  the  yen  weak  relative  to  the  dollar  and  fostered 
the  rapid  rise  in  the  Japanese  trade  surplus  that  took  place  in  the 
1980s. 

In  1985  a  dramatic  change  began.  Finance  officials  from  major 
nations  signed  an  agreement  (the  Plaza  Accord)  affirming  that  the 


281 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

dollar  was  overvalued  (and,  therefore,  the  yen  undervalued).  This 
agreement,  and  shifting  supply  and  demand  pressures  in  the  mar- 
kets, led  to  a  rapid  rise  in  the  value  of  the  yen.  From  its  average 
of  ¥239  per  US$1  in  1985,  the  yen  rose  to  a  peak  of  ¥128  in  1988, 
virtually  doubling  its  value  relative  to  the  dollar.  After  1988  the 
yen's  value  declined  slightly  to  ¥145  in  September  1989,  but  re- 
mained much  stronger  than  in  1985. 

The  yen's  increased  value  made  Japanese  exports  less  price  com- 
petitive and  imports  more  price  competitive,  which  should  have 
brought  down  the  value  of  trade  and  current  account  surpluses. 
The  current  account  figures  discussed  above,  however,  indicated 
that  such  a  response  was  slow.  The  strong  appreciation  of  the  yen 
began  in  1985,  but  the  current  account  continued  to  rise  until  1987, 
and  its  decline  in  1988  was  rather  small. 

Trade  and  Investment  Relations 

Japan  was  engaged  in  trade  and  investment  with  nearly  every 
country  in  the  world.  Generally  speaking,  however,  its  greatest  eco- 
nomic interaction  was  with  other  developed  countries,  and  over 
time  this  interaction  grew. 

In  1988  about  61  percent  of  exports  went  to  developed  coun- 
tries, 34  percent  to  developing  countries,  and  5  percent  to  com- 
munist countries.  The  largest  single  destination  of  Japanese  exports 
was  the  United  States,  which  accounted  for  an  extraordinary  33.8 
percent  of  all  exports.  The  United  States  was  the  major  growth 
market  for  Japanese  exports  in  the  1980s;  it  had  accounted  for  only 
24  percent  of  the  total  in  1980.  West  Germany,  Britain,  the  Repub- 
lic of  Korea  (South  Korea),  and  Taiwan  were  the  next  largest  mar- 
kets, at  the  much  lower  level  of  about  6  percent  each  (see  table 
33,  Appendix). 

Of  imports,  51  percent  came  from  developed  countries  in  1988, 
42  percent  from  developing  countries,  and  7  percent  from  com- 
munist countries,  with  the  developed  countries'  share  rising  over 
the  course  of  the  1980s  as  raw  materials,  which  predominate  in 
developing  country  sales  to  Japan,  declined  in  price.  Despite  Japan's 
dependence  on  foreign  sources  of  energy  and  raw  materials,  the 
United  States  was  the  largest  single  source  of  imports,  accounting 
for  22.4  percent  in  1988,  larger  than  the  combined  share  (10  per- 
cent) for  all  Middle  Eastern  countries,  the  suppliers  of  much  of 
Japan's  oil.  Over  time,  however,  dependence  on  United  States  im- 
ports had  slipped  rather  steadily,  from  34.6  percent  in  1960,  as 
sources  of  supply  diversified.  Other  major  sources  of  1988  imports 
were  South  Korea  (6.3  percent),  Australia  (5.5  percent),  China  (5.3 


282 


International  Economic  Relations 


percent),  Indonesia  (5.1  percent),  Taiwan  (4.7  percent),  Canada 
(4.4  percent),  and  West  Germany  (4.3  percent). 

Historically,  Japan  has  had  trade  deficits  with  raw  material  sup- 
pliers and  surpluses  with  other  countries.  In  the  1980s,  however, 
balances  with  all  trading  partners  shifted  somewhat  in  Japan's  favor. 
Its  surplus  in  trade  with  developed  countries  rose  from  US$12  bil- 
lion in  1980  to  US$67  billion  by  1988,  while  the  balance  with  de- 
veloping countries  shifted  from  a  deficit  of  US$25  billion  in  1980 
to  a  surplus  of  nearly  US$11  billion  in  1988.  Its  deficit  in  trade 
with  the  Middle  East,  peaked  at  about  US$30  billion  in  1980,  sink- 
ing to  only  US$10.5  billion  by  1988. 

Partly  because  of  this  rapid  shift  toward  surplus,  and  because 
of  continued  problems  of  access  to  Japanese  markets,  Japan  faced 
increased  tensions  with  a  number  of  its  trading  partners  during 
the  1980s.  The  decade  was  marked  by  contentious  negotiations  es- 
pecially with  the  United  States.  Complicating  the  nature  of  all  these 
relationships  was  the  very  swift  rise  of  Japan  as  a  major  investor 
in  the  domestic  assets  of  its  major  trading  partners. 

United  States  and  Canada 

The  United  States  has  been  Japan's  largest  economic  partner, 
taking  33.8  percent  of  its  exports,  supplying  22.4  percent  of  its  im- 
ports, and  accounting  for  38.6  percent  of  its  direct  investment 
abroad  in  1988.  The  United  States  also  supplied  47  percent  ac- 
cumulated direct  investment  by  foreign  firms  in  Japan. 

Japanese  imports  from  the  United  States  included  both  raw 
materials  and  manufactured  goods.  American  agricultural  products 
were  a  leading  import  in  1988  (US$9.1  billion  as  measured  by 
United  States  export  statistics),  made  up  of  meat  (US$1 .4  billion), 
fish  (US$1 .6  billion),  grains  (US$2.3  billion),  and  soybeans  (US$1 .0 
billion).  Imports  of  manufactured  goods  were  mainly  in  the  category 
of  machinery  and  transportation  equipment,  rather  than  consumer 
goods.  In  1988  Japan  imported  US$6.9  billion  of  machinery  from 
the  United  States,  of  which  computers  and  computer  parts  (US$2.4 
billion)  formed  the  largest  single  component.  In  the  category  of 
transportation  equipment,  Japan  imported  US$2.2  billion  of  air- 
craft and  parts  (automobiles  and  parts  accounted  for  only  US$500 
million). 

Japanese  exports  to  the  United  States  were  almost  entirely 
manufactured  goods.  Automobiles  were  by  far  the  largest  single 
category,  amounting  to  US$21  billion  in  1988,  or  23  percent  of 
total  Japanese  exports  to  the  United  States.  Automotive  parts  ac- 
counted for  another  US$5  billion.  Other  major  items  were  office 
machinery  (including  computers),  which  totaled  US$10.6  billion

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

in  1988,  telecommunications  equipment  (US$10.4  billion),  power 
generating  equipment  (US$3.3  billion),  iron  and  steel  (US$2.9  bil- 
lion), and  metalworking  machinery  (US$1.7  billion). 

From  the  mid-1960s,  the  trade  balance  has  been  in  Japan's  favor. 
According  to  Japanese  data,  its  surplus  with  the  United  States  grew 
from  US$380  million  in  1970  to  nearly  US$48  billion  in  1988. 
United  States  data  on  the  trade  relationship  (which  differ  slightly 
because  each  nation  includes  transportation  costs  on  the  import 
but  not  the  export  side)  also  show  a  rapid  deterioration  of  the  im- 
balance in  the  1980s,  from  a  Japanese  surplus  of  US$10  billion 
in  1980  to  one  of  US$60  billion  in  1987,  with  a  slight  improve- 
ment, to  one  of  US$55  billion,  in  1988. 

This  general  deterioration,  and  the  very  modest  improvement 
in  trade  balance  after  the  yen  rose  in  value  after  1985,  contributed 
greatly  to  strained  economic  relations.  The  United  States  had  pres- 
sured Japan  to  open  its  markets  since  the  early  1960s,  but  the  in- 
tensity of  the  pressure  increased  through  the  1970s  and  1980s. 

Tensions  were  exacerbated  by  issues  specific  to  particular  indus- 
tries perhaps  more  than  by  the  trade  imbalance  in  general.  Begin- 
ning with  textiles  in  the  1950s,  a  number  of  Japanese  exports  to 
the  United  States  were  subject  to  opposition  from  American  in- 
dustry. These  complaints  generally  alleged  unfair  trading  practices, 
such  as  dumping  (selling  at  a  lower  cost  than  at  home,  or  selling 
below  the  cost  of  production)  and  patent  infringement.  The  result 
of  negotiations  was  often  Japan's  agreement  "voluntarily"  to  re- 
strain exports  to  the  United  States.  Such  agreements  applied  to 
a  number  of  products,  including  color  television  sets  in  the  late 
1970s  and  automobiles  in  the  1980s. 

Some  innovative  approaches  emerged  in  the  1980s  as  United 
States  companies  strove  to  achieve  greater  access  to  Japanese  mar- 
kets. MOSS  negotiations  in  1985  addressed  access  problems  re- 
lated to  four  industries:  forest  products,  pharmaceuticals  and 
medical  equipment,  electronics,  and  telecommunications  equipment 
and  services. 

Problems  of  access  to  Japanese  markets  were  among  the  moti- 
vations for  the  United  States  Trade  Act  of  1988,  which  included 
a  provision  calling  on  the  president  to  identify  unfair  trading  part- 
ners of  the  United  States  and  to  specify  products  for  negotiation 
with  these  countries.  In  the  spring  of  1989,  Japan  was  named  under 
this  provision  and  three  areas — forest  products,  telecommunica- 
tions satellites,  and  supercomputers — were  selected  for  negotiations. 
This  action  exemplified  the  continuing  mood  of  dissatisfaction  over 
access  to  Japanese  markets  at  the  end  of  the  decade  (see  Import 
Policies,  this  ch.). 


284 


International  Economic  Relations 


At  the  same  time,  the  United  States  initiated  broad  talks  con- 
cerning the  structural  factors  inhibiting  manufactured  imports  in 
Japan,  in  the  Structural  Impediments  Initiative.  These  talks  ad- 
dressed such  areas  as  the  law  restraining  the  growth  of  large  dis- 
count store  chains  in  Japan,  weak  antitrust  law  enforcement,  land 
taxation  that  encouraged  inefficient  farming,  and  high  real  estate 
prices. 

As  elsewhere,  Japanese  direct  investment  in  the  United  States 
expanded  rapidly  and  had  become  an  important  new  dimension 
in  the  countries'  relationship.  The  total  value  of  cumulative  in- 
vestments of  this  kind  was  US$8.7  billion  in  1980;  it  had  grown 
by  more  than  eight  times  by  1988  to  US$71.9  billion.  United  States 
data  identified  Japan  as  the  second  largest  investor  in  the  United 
States;  it  had  about  half  the  value  of  investments  of  Britain,  but 
more  than  those  of  the  Netherlands,  Canada,  or  West  Germany. 
Much  of  Japan's  investment  in  the  United  States  in  the  late  1980s 
was  in  the  commercial  sector,  providing  the  basis  for  distribution 
and  sale  of  Japanese  exports  to  the  United  States.  Wholesale  and 
retail  distribution  accounted  for  35  percent  of  all  Japanese  invest- 
ments in  the  United  States  in  1988,  while  manufacturing  accounted 
for  23  percent.  Real  estate  became  a  popular  investment  during 
the  1980s,  with  cumulative  investments  rising  to  US$10  billion  by 
1988,  20  percent  of  the  total. 

Japan's  balance  of  trade  with  Canada  tended  to  be  in  deficit  be- 
cause Canada  was  a  supplier  of  raw  materials  to  Japan.  In  1988 
Canada  was  the  destination  for  2.4  percent  of  Japan's  exports  and 
the  source  of  4.4  percent  of  its  imports.  Canada  was  a  major  sup- 
plier of  food  (particularly  wheat),  wood  and  wood  pulp,  and  coal. 
Japan's  deficit  with  Canada  in  1988  was  US$1.9  billion. 

Noncommunist  Asia 

The  developing  nations  of  Asia  grew  rapidly  as  suppliers  to  and 
buyers  from  Japan.  In  1988  these  countries  (including  South  Korea, 
Taiwan,  Hong  Kong,  Singapore,  Indonesia,  and  other  countries 
in  Southeast  Asia)  accounted  for  25  percent  of  Japan's  exports, 
a  share  well  below  the  34  percent  value  of  1960,  but  one  that  had 
been  roughly  constant  since  1970.  In  1988  developing  Asian  coun- 
tries provided  26  percent  of  Japan's  imports,  a  share  that  had  risen 
slowly,  from  16  percent  in  1970  and  23  percent  in  1980. 

As  a  whole,  Japan  had  run  a  surplus  with  noncommunist  Asia, 
and  this  surplus  rose  quickly  in  the  1980s.  From  a  minor  deficit 
in  1980  of  US$841  million  (mostly  caused  by  a  peak  in  the  value 
of  oil  imports  from  Indonesia),  Japan  showed  a  surplus  of  nearly 
US$3  billion  with  these  countries  in  1985  and  of  over  US$19  billion 


285 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

in  1988.  The  shift  was  caused  by  the  fall  in  the  prices  of  oil  and 
other  raw  materials  that  Japan  imported  from  the  region  and  to 
the  rapid  growth  in  Japanese  exports  as  the  region's  economic 
growth  continued  at  a  high  rate. 

Indonesia  and  Malaysia  both  continued  to  show  a  trade  surplus 
because  of  their  heavy  raw  material  exports  to  Japan.  However, 
falling  oil  prices  caused  trade  in  both  directions  between  Japan  and 
Indonesia  to  decline  in  the  1980s.  Trade  similarly  declined  with 
the  Philippines,  owing  to  the  political  turmoil  and  economic  con- 
traction there  in  the  1980s. 

South  Korea,  Taiwan,  Hong  Kong,  and  Singapore  constituted 
the  newly  industrialized  economies  (NIEs)  in  Asia,  and  all  four 
exhibited  high  economic  growth  during  the  1970s  and  1980s.  Like 
Japan,  they  lacked  many  raw  materials  and  mainly  exported 
manufactured  goods.  Their  deficits  with  Japan  increased  from  1980 
to  1988  when  the  deficits  of  all  four  were  sizeable.  Over  the  1970s 
and  1980s,  they  evolved  a  pattern  of  importing  components  from 
Japan  and  exporting  assembled  products  to  the  United  States. 

Japanese  direct  investment  in  Asia  also  expanded,  with  the  total 
cumulative  value  reaching  over  US$32  billion  by  1988.  Indone- 
sia, at  US$9.8  billion  in  1988  was  the  largest  single  location  for 
these  investments.  As  rapid  as  the  growth  of  investment  was, 
however,  it  did  not  keep  pace  with  Japan's  global  investment,  so 
the  share  of  Asia  in  total  cumulative  investment  slipped,  from  26.5 
percent  in  1975  to  17.3  percent  in  1988. 

Western  Europe 

Japan's  trade  with  Western  Europe  grew  steadily,  but  had  been 
relatively  small  well  into  the  1 980s  considering  the  size  of  this  mar- 
ket. In  1980  Western  Europe  supplied  only  7.4  percent  of  Japan's 
imports  and  took  16.6  percent  of  its  exports.  However,  the  rela- 
tionship began  to  change  very  rapidly  after  1985.  West  European 
exports  to  Japan  increased  two  and  one-half  times  in  just  the  three 
years  from  1985  to  1988  and  rose  as  a  share  of  all  Japanese  im- 
ports to  16  percent.  (Much  of  this  increase  came  from  growing 
Japanese  interest  in  European  consumer  items,  including  luxury 
automobiles.)  Likewise,  Japan's  exports  to  Europe  rose  rapidly  after 
1985,  more  than  doubling  by  1988  and  accounting  for  21  percent 
of  all  Japanese  exports. 

In  1988  the  major  European  buyers  of  Japanese  exports  were 
West  Germany  (US$15.8  billion)  and  Britain  (US$10.6  billion)  (see 
table  34,  Appendix).  The  largest  European  suppliers  to  Japan  were 
West  Germany  (US$8. 1  billion),  France  (US$4  billion),  and  Brit- 
ain (US$4.2  billion)  (see  table  35,  Appendix).  Traditionally,  West 


286 


International  Economic  Relations 


European  countries  had  trade  deficits  with  Japan,  and  this  con- 
tinued to  be  the  case  in  1988,  despite  the  surge  in  Japan's  imports 
from  them  after  1985.  From  1980  to  1988,  the  deficit  of  the  West 
European  countries  as  a  whole  expanded  from  US$11  billion  to 
US$25  billion,  with  much  of  the  increase  coming  after  1985. 

Trade  relations  with  Western  Europe  were  strained  during  the 
1980s.  Policies  varied  among  the  individual  countries,  but  many 
imposed  restrictions  on  Japanese  imports.  Late  in  the  decade,  as 
discussions  proceeded  on  the  trade  and  investment  policies  that 
would  prevail  with  European  economic  integration  in  1992,  many 
Japanese  officials  and  business  people  became  concerned  that  pro- 
tectionism directed  against  Japan  would  increase.  Domestic  con- 
tent requirements  (specifying  the  share  of  local  products  and  value 
added  in  a  product)  and  requirements  on  the  location  of  research 
and  development  facilities  and  manufacturing  investments  appeared 
likely. 

Fear  of  a  protectionist  Western  Europe  accelerated  Japanese 
direct  investment  in  the  second  half  of  the  1980s.  Total  accumu- 
lated Japanese  direct  investments  in  the  region  grew  from  US$4.5 
billion  in  1980  to  over  US$30  billion  in  1988,  from  12.2  percent 
to  more  than  16  percent  of  such  Japanese  investments.  Rather  than 
being  discouraged  by  protectionist  signals  from  Europe,  Japanese 
businesses  appeared  to  be  determined  to  play  a  significant  role  in 
what  promised  to  be  a  large,  vigorous,  and  integrated  market  in 
the  1990s.  Investment  offered  the  surest  means  of  circumventing 
protectionism,  and  Japanese  business  appeared  to  be  willing  to  com- 
ply with  whatever  domestic  content  or  other  performance  require- 
ments the  European  Communities  might  impose. 

The  Middle  East 

The  importance  of  the  Middle  East  expanded  dramatically  in 
the  1970s  with  the  jumps  in  crude  oil  prices.  Japan  was  deeply  con- 
cerned with  maintaining  good  relations  with  these  oil-producing 
nations  to  avoid  a  debilitating  cut  in  oil  supplies.  During  the  1980s, 
however,  oil  prices  fell  and  Japan's  concerns  over  the  security  of 
its  oil  supply  diminished  greatly. 

The  Middle  East  represented  only  7.5  percent  of  total  Japanese 
imports  in  1960  and  12.4  percent  in  1970,  with  the  small  rise  result- 
ing from  the  rapid  increase  in  the  volume  of  oil  consumed  by  the 
growing  Japanese  economy.  By  1980,  however,  this  share  had 
climbed  to  a  peak  of  31.7  percent  because  of  the  two  rounds  of 
price  hikes  in  the  1970s.  Falling  oil  prices  after  1980  brought  this 
share  back  down  to  10.5  percent  by  1988 — actually  a  lower  per- 
centage than  in  1970,  before  the  price  hikes  had  started.  The  major 


287 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

oil  suppliers  to  Japan  in  1988  were  Saudi  Arabia  and  the  United 
Arab  Emirates.  Iran,  Iraq,  and  Kuwait  were  also  significant,  but 
smaller,  sources.  These  three  countries  became  less  important  oil 
suppliers  after  1980  because  of  the  Iran-Iraq  war  (1980-88)  and 
resulting  damage  to  loading  facilities  and  shipping. 

As  imports  from  the  Middle  East  surged  in  the  1970s,  so  did 
Japanese  exports  to  the  region.  Paralleling  the  pattern  for  imports, 
however,  this  share  fell  in  the  1980s.  Equalling  1.8  percent  in  1960, 
exports  to  this  region  rose  to  11.1  percent  of  total  Japanese  exports 
in  1980,  but  then  declined  to  3.6  percent  by  1988. 

Part  of  Japan's  strategy  to  assure  oil  supplies  was  to  encourage 
investment  in  oil-supplying  countries.  However,  such  investment 
never  kept  pace  with  Japan's  investments  in  other  regions.  The 
country's  expanding  need  for  oil  helped  push  direct  investment  in 
the  Middle  East  to  9.3  percent  of  total  direct  investments  abroad 
by  Japanese  companies  in  1970,  but  this  share  had  fallen  to  6.2 
percent  by  1980  and  to  only  1.8  percent  by  1988.  The  Iran-Iraq 
war  was  a  major  factor  in  the  declining  interest  of  Japanese  inves- 
tors, exemplified  by  the  fate  of  a  large  US$3  billion  petrochemical 
complex  in  Iran,  which  was  almost  complete  when  the  revolution 
took  place  in  1979.  Completion  was  delayed  first  by  political  con- 
cerns (when  United  States  embassy  personnel  were  held  hostage) 
and  then  by  repeated  Iraqi  bombing  raids.  The  project  was  finally 
cancelled  in  1989,  with  losses  for  both  Japanese  companies  and  the 
Japanese  government,  which  had  provided  insurance  for  the  project. 

Oceania 

Australia  and  New  Zealand  were  predominantly  sources  of  food 
and  raw  materials  for  Japan.  In  1988  Australia  accounted  for  5.5 
percent  of  total  Japanese  imports,  a  share  that  held  relatively  steady 
in  the  late  1980s,  while  New  Zealand  accounted  for  less  than  1  per- 
cent. Because  they  provided  raw  materials,  both  nations  had  trade 
surpluses  with  Japan.  Australia  was  the  largest  single  supplier  of 
coal,  iron  ore,  wool,  and  sugar  to  Japan  in  1988,  while  New  Zealand 
was  the  second  largest  supplier  of  wool. 

Resource  development  projects  in  Australia  attracted  Japanese 
capital,  as  did  trade  protectionism  by  necessitating  local  produc- 
tion for  the  Australian  market.  Investments  in  Australia  totaled 
US$8. 1  billion  in  1988,  accounting  for  4.4  percent  of  Japanese  direct 
investment  abroad.  But,  because  of  the  broadening  reach  of  Japan's 
foreign  investment,  this  share  had  been  declining,  down  from  5.9 
percent  in  1980.  During  the  1980s,  Japanese  real  estate  investment 
increased  in  Australia,  particularly  in  the  ocean  resort  area  known 


288 


International  Economic  Relations 


as  the  Gold  Coast,  where  Japanese  presence  was  strong  enough 
to  create  some  backlash. 

The  trade  of  both  Australia  and  New  Zealand  had  shifted  away 
from  other  Commonwealth  of  Nations  countries  toward  Asia.  Japan 
in  particular  had  emerged  as  the  leading  trading  partner  for  these 
two  countries.  Faced  with  growing  interdependence  with  Asia,  Aus- 
tralia joined  Japan  in  actively  calling  for  greater  consultation  and 
cooperation  among  Pacific  nations.  Still,  Australia  and  New  Zea- 
land faced  quotas,  high  tariffs,  and  unusual  standards  barriers  in 
exporting  agricultural  products  including  beef,  butter,  and  apples, 
to  Japan. 

Latin  America 

In  the  1970s,  Japan  briefly  showed  enthusiasm  over  Brazilian 
prospects.  A  vast  territory  richly  endowed  with  raw  materials  and 
with  a  sizable  Japanese-Brazilian  minority  in  the  population,  Brazil 
appeared  to  Japanese  business  to  offer  great  opportunities  for  trade 
and  investment.  However,  none  of  those  expectations  have  been 
realized,  and  Japanese  financial  institutions  became  caught  up  in 
the  international  debt  problems  of  Brazil  and  other  Latin  Ameri- 
can countries. 

In  1988  Japan  received  US$8.3  billion  of  imports  from  Latin 
America  as  a  whole,  and  exported  US$9.3  billion  to  the  region, 
for  a  surplus  of  US$1  billion.  Although  the  absolute  value  of  both 
exports  and  imports  had  grown  over  time,  Latin  America  had 
declined  in  importance  as  a  Japanese  trading  partner.  The  share 
of  Japan's  total  imports  coming  from  this  region  dropped  from  7.3 
percent  in  1970  to  4.1  percent  in  1980,  remaining  at  4.4  percent 
in  1988.  Japanese  exports  to  Latin  America  also  declined,  from 
6.9  percent  in  1980  to  3.5  percent  in  1988. 

Despite  this  relative  decline  in  trade,  Japanese  direct  investment 
in  the  region  continued  to  grow  quickly,  reaching  US$31 .6  billion 
in  1988,  or  16.9  percent  of  Japan's  total  foreign  direct  investment. 
This  share  was  only  slightly  below  that  ofl975(18.1  percent)  and 
was  almost  equal  to  the  share  in  Asian  countries.  However,  over 
US$11  billion  of  this  investment  was  in  Panama — mainly  for 
Panamanian-flag  shipping,  which  does  not  represent  true  invest- 
ment in  the  country.  The  Bahamas  also  attracted  US$1.9  billion 
in  investment,  mainly  from  Japanese  financial  institutions,  but  in 
arrangements  to  secure  favorable  tax  treatment  rather  than  real 
investments.  Brazil  absorbed  US$5  billion  in  Japanese  direct  in- 
vestment, Mexico  US$1 .6  billion,  and  other  Latin  American  coun- 
tries amounts  below  US$1  billion  in  the  late  1980s.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Latin  American  countries  lie  at  the  heart  of  the  Third  World 
debt  problems  that  plagued  international  financial  relations  in  the 
1980s.  Japanese  financial  institutions  became  involved  as  lenders 
to  these  nations,  although  they  were  far  less  exposed  than  United 
States  banks.  Because  of  this  financial  involvement,  the  Japanese 
government  was  actively  involved  in  international  discussions  of 
how  to  resolve  the  crisis.  In  1987,  Minister  of  Finance  Miyazawa 
Kiichi  put  forth  a  proposal  on  resolving  the  debt  issue.  Although 
that  initiative  did  not  go  through,  the  Brady  Plan  that  emerged 
in  1989  contained  some  elements  of  the  Miyazawa  Plan.  The 
Japanese  government  supported  the  Brady  Plan  by  pledging  US$10 
billion  in  cofinancing  with  the  World  Bank  and  IMF. 

Africa 

Africa  has  been  the  least  important  world  region  for  Japanese 
trade  and  investment.  Japan  had  little  historical  experience  with 
Africa  and  little  interest  in  economic  ties  with  the  region,  except 
for  development  of  raw  material  supplies. 

In  1988  Africa  accounted  for  just  over  1  percent  of  Japan's  im- 
ports and  for  1  percent  of  its  exports.  Japan's  largest  trading  part- 
ner in  Africa  in  1988  was  South  Africa,  which  accounted  for  34 
percent  of  Japanese  exports  to  Africa  and  45  percent  of  Japan's 
imports  from  the  region.  Because  of  trading  sanctions  imposed  on 
South  Africa  by  the  United  States  and  other  countries,  Japan 
emerged  as  South  Africa's  largest  trading  partner  during  the  1980s. 
This  position  proved  embarrassing  to  Japan  and  led  it  to  down- 
grade some  diplomatic  and  economic  relations  with  the  country. 
Despite  the  fact  that  South  Africa  remained  Japan's  largest  trad- 
ing partner  in  the  region,  both  exports  and  imports  in  1988  had 
declined  by  more  than  one-third  from  their  value  in  1980. 

Africa  was  the  location  of  only  US$4.6  billion  or  2.5  percent  of 
Japanese  foreign  direct  investment  in  1988,  of  which  most  (US$3.6 
billion)  was  in  Liberia.  As  in  Panama,  this  investment  was  mainly 
in  the  form  of  flag-of-convenience  shipping.  Japanese  data  showed 
virtually  no  direct  investment  in  South  Africa  (US$1  million),  and 
no  new  investment  in  this  country  during  the  1980s. 

Communist  Countries 

Japan's  experience  with  communist  countries  was  quite  limited 
in  the  years  after  the  war.  In  the  1980s,  its  patterns  of  interaction 
with  China  and  the  Soviet  Union  diverged  sharply,  its  relations 
with  China  growing  quickly,  those  with  the  Soviet  Union  stagnat- 
ing. Other  communist  areas,  such  as  Eastern  Europe,  continued 
to  be  only  tiny  trade  and  investment  partners  for  Japan.

International  Economic  Relations 


Exports  to  communist  countries  totaled  US$13.8  billion  in  1988, 
or  5.2  percent  of  Japan's  exports.  Imports  from  these  countries 
totaled  nearly  US$13.9  billion,  yielding  a  virtual  balance  in  trade. 
Imports  from  the  Soviet  Union  declined  during  the  first  half  of  the 
1980s,  from  nearly  US$1.9  billion  to  less  than  US$1.5  billion,  and 
then  recovered  to  almost  US$2.8  billion  by  1988,  representing  a 
modest  growth  for  the  entire  period.  Imports  from  China,  on  the 
other  hand,  more  than  doubled  in  this  time,  from  just  over  US$4.3 
billion  in  1980  to  nearly  US$9.9  billion  in  1988.  Export  trade  fol- 
lowed a  similar  pattern:  exports  to  the  Soviet  Union  stagnated  and 
then  grew  modestly,  to  over  US$3.1  billion  in  1988,  while  those 
to  China  expanded  rapidly,  from  nearly  US$5.1  billion  in  1980 
to  just  under  US$9.5  billion  in  1988. 

China  and  Japan  have  geographic  proximity,  extensive  cultural 
ties,  and  a  long  history  of  commercial  relations.  However,  Japan's 
trade  relationship  with  China  was  severely  constrained  in  the  1950s 
and  1960s  because  of  its  support  for  the  United  States  policy  of 
containment.  Japanese  business  did  not  expand  such  commercial 
relations  significantly  until  the  United  States-China  rapprochement 
in  the  early  1970s  and  Japan's  subsequent  establishment  of  diplo- 
matic relations  with  China  (see  Relations  with  China,  ch.  7).  Japan 
recognized  the  Beijing  government  in  1972.  After  Mao  Zedong's 
death  in  1976,  China  pursued  economic  contacts  with  the  West, 
and  trade  with  Japan  expanded  rapidly.  The  new  relationship  was 
reinforced  by  the  signing  of  a  Long-Term  Trade  Agreement  in 
1978.  In  1980  Japan  granted  China  reduced  tariff  treatment  under 
the  Generalized  System  of  Preferences. 

Investment  in  China  also  expanded  once  relations  improved  in 
the  1970s.  Japanese  data  show  some  US$2  billion  of  cumulative 
direct  investment  in  China  by  1988.  China  also  became  the  larg- 
est single  recipient  of  foreign  aid  from  Japan  during  the  1980s. 
However,  a  treaty  establishing  a  firm  legal  framework  for  direct 
investment,  remained  to  be  completed  at  the  end  of  the  1980s.  Fur- 
thermore, the  massacre  of  Chinese  prodemocracy  demonstrators 
in  Beijing's  1989  Tiananmen  Incident,  and  subsequent  political 
and  economic  tightening  in  China  discouraged  new  Japanese  in- 
vestment. 

Commercial  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union  also  paralleled  stra- 
tegic developments.  Japan  was  very  interested  in  Siberian  raw 
materials  in  the  early  1970s  as  prices  were  rising  and  detente  per- 
sisted. The  challenges  to  detente,  especially  the  invasion  of  Af- 
ghanistan in  1979  and  falling  raw  material  prices,  put  strong 
constraints  on  Japanese  trade  and  investment  relations  with  the 
Soviet  Union.  Only  after  Soviet  policy  began  to  change  under 


291 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Mikhail  Gorbachev's  leadership,  beginning  in  1985,  did  Japanese 
trade  resume  its  growth. 

Further  complicating  economic  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union 
was  the  dispute  over  four  small  northern  islands  occupied  by  the 
Soviets  toward  the  end  of  World  War  II.  No  progress  had  taken 
place  on  this  issue  during  three  decades  of  intermittent  negotia- 
tions. However,  the  1980s  ended  with  new  hope  that  a  settlement 
would  emerge.  Were  this  to  occur,  economic  relations  with  the 
Soviet  Union  might  expand  more  rapidly  (see  Relations  with  the 
Soviet  Union,  ch.  7). 

Japan's  trade  was  also  constrained  by  the  Coordinating  Com- 
mittee for  Multilateral  Export  Controls  (CoCom),  which  controlled 
exports  of  strategic  high  technology.  In  1987  the  United  States  dis- 
covered that  Toshiba  Machine  Tool  had  shipped  machine  tools  on 
the  restricted  list  to  the  Soviet  Union,  tools  used  to  manufacture 
quieter  submarine  propellers.  Although  the  Japanese  government 
moved  reluctantly  to  punish  Toshiba  (and  the  United  States  im- 
posed sanctions  on  Toshiba  exports  to  the  United  States  in 
response),  the  final  outcome  was  stronger  surveillance  and  punish- 
ment for  CoCom  violations  in  Japan. 

Japanese  investment  loans  and  trade  credits  went  mainly  to 
Siberian  resource  development.  But  this  development  never  ex- 
panded as  originally  expected.  Soviet  interest  in  revitalizing  the 
economy  in  the  late  1980s  suggested  that  future  Japanese  invest- 
ment would  be  concentrated  in  the  western  regions  of  the  Soviet 
Union  rather  than  in  Siberia. 

Japan's  trade  and  investment  relations  with  other  communist 
countries  in  Eastern  Europe  and  Asia  were  very  limited.  In  1988 
exports  to  Eastern  Europe  were  less  than  US$1  billion,  as  were 
imports  from  the  region.  The  reunification  of  Germany  and  the 
rapid  disintegration  of  communist  regimes  in  other  East  European 
countries  may  open  the  prospect  of  expanded  trade  and  investment 
during  the  1990s,  but  economic  problems  within  the  region  as  these 
nations  grappled  with  moving  toward  market-oriented  economies 
were  likely  to  continue  to  limit  trade  with  Japan.  Trade  with  other 
Asian  communist  countries  was  even  less  significant.  The  Demo- 
cratic Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea)  is  geographically  close  to 
Japan,  but  that  nation's  default  on  trade  debt  in  the  1960s,  com- 
bined with  the  political  tension  between  it  and  the  Republic  of  Korea 
(South  Korea)  kept  North  Korean  trade  with  Japan  at  a  minimum. 

International  Economic  Cooperation  and  Aid 

Japan  emerged  as  one  of  the  largest  aid  donors  in  the  world  dur- 
ing the  1980s.  In  1988  Japan  was  the  second  largest  foreign  aid 


292 


International  Economic  Relations 


donor  worldwide,  behind  the  United  States.  Japan's  ratio  of  for- 
eign aid  to  GNP  in  this  year  was  0.32  percent  behind  the  0.35  per- 
cent average  for  the  OECD's  Development  Assistance  Committee 
member  countries,  but  ahead  of  the  United  States  ratio  of  0.20 
percent. 

The  foreign  aid  program  began  in  the  1960s  out  of  the  repara- 
tions payments  Japan  was  obliged  to  pay  to  other  Asian  countries 
for  war  damage.  The  program's  budget  remained  quite  low  until 
the  late  1970s,  when  Japan  came  under  increasing  pressure  from 
other  industrial  countries  to  play  a  larger  role.  During  the  1980s, 
Japan's  foreign  aid  budget  grew  quickly,  despite  the  budget  con- 
straints imposed  by  the  effort  to  reduce  the  fiscal  deficit.  From  1984 
to  1988,  the  Official  Development  Assistance  (ODA)  budget  in- 
creased at  an  average  annual  rate  of  22.5  percent,  reaching  US$9. 1 
billion  by  1988.  Part  of  this  rise  was  due  to  exchange  rate  move- 
ments (with  given  yen  amounts  committed  in  the  budget  becom- 
ing larger  dollar  amounts).  In  the  Japanese  government  budget, 
foreign  aid  rose  at  a  lower,  but  still  strong  rate,  of  between  4  per- 
cent and  12  percent  each  year  during  the  1980s,  with  an  average 
annual  rate  of  growth  from  1979  to  1988  of  8.6  percent. 

Such  assistance  consisted  of  grants  and  loans,  and  support  for 
multilateral  aid  organizations.  In  1988  Japan  allocated  US$6.4  bil- 
lion of  its  aid  budget  to  bilateral  assistance  and  US$2.7  billion  to 
multilateral  agencies.  Of  the  bilateral  assistance,  US$2.9  billion 
went  for  grants  and  US$3.5  billion  for  concessional  loans. 

Japan's  foreign  aid  program  has  been  criticized  for  better  serv- 
ing the  interests  of  Japanese  corporations  than  those  of  develop- 
ing countries.  In  the  past,  tied  aid  (grants  or  loans  tied  to  the 
purchase  of  merchandise  from  Japan)  was  high,  but  untied  aid  ex- 
panded rapidly  in  the  1980s,  reaching  71  percent  of  all  aid  by  1986. 
This  share  compared  favorably  with  other  Development  Assistance 
Committee  countries  and  with  the  United  States  corresponding 
figure  of  54  percent.  Nevertheless,  complaints  continued  that  even 
Japan's  untied  aid  tended  to  be  directed  toward  purchases  from 
Japan.  Aid  in  the  form  of  grants  (the  share  of  aid  disbursed  as  grants 
rather  than  as  loans)  was  low  relative  to  other  Development  As- 
sistance Committee  countries,  and  remained  so  late  in  the  1980s. 

Bilateral  assistance  was  concentrated  in  the  developing  countries 
of  Asia,  although  modest  moves  took  place  in  the  1980s  to  expand 
the  geographical  scope  of  aid.  In  1988  some  62.8  percent  of  bilateral 
development  assistance  was  allocated  to  Asia,  13.8  percent  to  Africa, 
9.1  percent  to  the  Middle  East,  and  6.2  percent  to  Latin  America. 
Asia's  share  was  down  somewhat,  from  75  percent  in  1975  and 
70  percent  in  1980,  but  still  accounted  for  by  far  the  largest  share 


293 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

of  bilateral  aid.  During  the  1980s,  increased  aid  went  to  Pakistan 
and  Egypt,  partly  in  response  to  pressure  from  the  United  States 
to  provide  such  aid  for  strategic  purposes.  Japan  had  little  involve- 
ment in  Africa,  but  the  severe  drought  of  the  1980s  brought  an 
increase  in  the  share  of  development  assistance  for  that  continent. 

The  five  largest  recipients  of  Japanese  ODA  in  1988  were  in  Asia: 
Indonesia  (US$985  million),  China  (US$674  million),  the  Philip- 
pines (US$535  million),  Thailand  (US$361  million),  and  Bangla- 
desh (US$342  million).  Earlier  in  the  1980s,  China  had  been  the 
largest  single  recipient  for  several  successive  years.  These  large  aid 
amounts  made  Japan  the  largest  single  source  of  development  as- 
sistance for  most  Asian  countries.  For  the  Association  of  Southeast 
Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  countries,  for  example,  Japan  supplied 
55  percent  of  net  ODA  received  in  1987,  compared  with  11  per- 
cent from  the  United  States  and  only  10  percent  from  the  multi- 
lateral aid  agencies. 

The  largest  use  of  Japan's  bilateral  aid  was  for  economic  infra- 
structure (transportation,  communications,  river  development,  and 
energy  development),  which  accounted  for  39  percent  of  the  total 
in  1988.  Smaller  shares  went  to  development  of  the  production  sec- 
tor (19  percent)  and  social  infrastructure  (16  percent).  In  general, 
large  construction  projects  predominated  in  Japan's  bilateral  for- 
eign aid.  Even  within  the  category  of  social  infrastructure,  water 
supply  and  sanitation,  which  involved  major  construction  projects, 
absorbed  the  largest  amount  of  money  (5.8  percent  of  the  bilateral 
aid  in  1988,  compared  with  4.7  percent  for  education  and  only  2 
percent  for  health).  Food  aid  (0.5  percent  of  total  bilateral  aid  in 
1988)  and  debt  relief  (2.7  percent)  were  not  important  parts  of 
Japan's  official  development  assistance. 

Major  International  Industries 

As  in  most  countries,  a  relatively  small  number  of  industries 
dominated  Japan's  trade  and  investment  interaction  with  the  rest 
of  the  world.  In  the  late  1980s,  those  industries  were  motor  vehi- 
cles, consumer  electronics,  computers,  semiconductors  and  other 
electronic  components,  and  iron  and  steel. 

Motor  Vehicles 

The  motor  vehicle  industry  was  the  most  successful  industry  in 
Japan  in  the  1980s.  In  1988  Japan  produced  8.2  million  passenger 
cars,  making  it  the  largest  producer  in  the  world  (the  United  States 
in  that  year  produced  7.1  million),  and  54  percent  of  that  output 
was  exported.  Passenger  cars,  other  motor  vehicles,  and  automo- 
tive parts  were  the  largest  class  of  Japanese  exports  throughout  the 


294 


International  Economic  Relations 


1980s.  In  1988  they  accounted  for  18  percent  of  all  Japanese  ex- 
ports, a  meteoric  rise  from  only  1.9  percent  in  1960. 

Fear  of  protectionism  in  the  United  States  also  led  to  major  direct 
foreign  investments  there  by  Japanese  auto  producers.  By  the  end 
of  the  decade,  all  the  major  Japanese  producers  had  automotive 
assembly  lines  operating  in  the  United  States:  Honda,  Toyota,  Nis- 
san, Mazda,  and  Isuzu  (in  a  joint  plant  with  Subaru).  Following 
the  major  assembly  firms,  Japanese  auto  parts  producers  also  began 
investing  in  the  United  States  in  the  late  1980s. 

Automobiles  were  a  major  area  of  contention  for  the  United 
States-Japan  relationship  during  the  1980s.  When  the  price  of  oil 
rose  in  1979,  demand  for  small  automobiles  increased,  which 
worked  to  the  advantage  of  Japanese  exports  in  the  United  States 
market.  As  the  Japanese  share  of  the  market  increased,  to  21.8 
percent  in  1981,  pressures  rose  to  restrict  imports  from  Japan.  The 
result  of  these  pressures  was  a  series  of  negotiations  in  early  1981 , 
which  produced  a  "voluntary"  export  agreement  limiting  Japanese 
shipments  to  the  United  States  to  1 .68  million  units  (excluding  cer- 
tain kinds  of  specialty  vehicles  and  trucks).  This  agreement  re- 
mained in  effect  for  the  rest  of  the  decade,  with  the  limit  reset  at 
2.3  million  units  in  1985.  As  Japanese  assembly  lines  in  the  United 
States  came  on  line,  imports  of  Japanese  automobiles  in  1988  ac- 
tually fell  below  the  limit. 

Similar  restraints  on  Japanese  exports  were  imposed  by  Can- 
ada and  several  West  European  countries.  Japan's  investment  in- 
creased in  Western  Europe  as  well,  but  it  faced  pressure  to  achieve 
high  local  value  added  as  discussion  proceeded  on  the  European 
Economic  Community  unification  slated  for  1992. 

Foreign  penetration  of  the  automotive  market  in  Japan  was  less 
successful.  Imports  of  foreign  automobiles  were  very  low  during 
the  forty  years  prior  to  1985,  never  exceeding  60,000  units  annu- 
ally, or  1  percent  of  the  domestic  market.  Trade  and  investment 
barriers  restricted  imported  cars  to  an  insignificant  share  of  the 
market  in  the  1950s,  and  as  barriers  were  finally  lowered,  strong 
control  over  the  distribution  networks  made  penetration  difficult. 
The  major  American  automobile  manufacturers  acquired  minor- 
ity interests  in  some  Japanese  firms  when  investment  restrictions 
were  relaxed,  Ford  obtaining  a  25  percent  interest  in  Toyo  Kogyo 
(Mazda),  General  Motors  a  34  percent  interest  in  Isuzu,  and  Chrys- 
ler a  15  percent  interest  in  Mitsubishi  Motors.  This  ownership  did 
not  provide  a  means  for  American  cars  to  penetrate  the  Japanese 
market  until  the  end  of  the  1980s. 

After  the  strong  appreciation  of  the  yen  in  1985,  however, 
Japanese  demand  for  foreign  automobiles  increased.  The  greater 


295 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

sense  of  affluence  in  Japanese  society  was  accompanied  by  a  ris- 
ing interest  in  European  design.  In  1988  automobile  imports  to- 
taled 150,629  units,  of  which  127,309  were  European,  mostly  West 
German.  Only  21 , 124  units  were  imported  from  the  United  States 
in  1988. 

Consumer  Electronics 

The  industries  producing  consumer  electronics — audio  receivers, 
compact  disc  players,  and  other  audio  components;  tape  recorders, 
television  receivers,  video  cassette  recorders,  and  video  cameras — 
were  major  exporters,  and  in  the  1980s  they  invested  overseas  as 
well.  In  1988,  34  percent  of  color  televisions  produced  in  Japan 
were  exported,  as  were  79  percent  of  video  cassette  recorders.  Some 
of  these  products  had  too  small  an  export  share  to  show  up  separately 
in  summary  trade  data,  but  audio  tape  recorders  represented  2.9 
percent  of  total  Japanese  exports  in  1988,  video  cassette  recorders 
2.3  percent,  radio  receivers  0.8  percent,  and  television  receivers 
0.7  percent,  for  a  total  of  6.7  percent. 

All  of  these  industries  built  on  Japan's  success  in  developing  com- 
mercial applications  for  the  transistor  in  the  1950s  and  the  suc- 
ceeding generations  of  semiconductor  devices  of  the  1970s  and 
1980s.  Most  of  this  output  came  from  large  integrated  electronics 
firms,  which  manufactured  semiconductor  devices,  consumer  elec- 
tronics, and  computers.  Their  international  success  came  from  con- 
tinually pushing  miniaturization  and  driving  down  manufacturing 
costs  through  innovations  in  the  manufacturing  process. 

Mainly  because  of  Japanese  industry's  success,  the  American 
consumer  electronics  industry  withered.  During  the  1970s,  Japanese 
inroads  in  the  American  market  for  color  television  receivers  sparked 
charges  of  dumping  and  other  predatory  practices.  These  disputes 
led  to  an  orderly  marketing  agreement  or  voluntary  export  restraint 
by  Japan  in  1977,  which  limited  exports  of  color  televisions  to  1 .75 
million  units  annually  between  1977  and  1980.  While  this  agree- 
ment afforded  some  protection  to  the  domestic  industry,  Japanese 
firms  responded  by  investing  in  the  United  States.  By  the  end  of 
the  1980s,  only  one  American-owned  television  manufacturer  re- 
mained; the  others  had  disappeared  or  been  bought  by  West  Eu- 
ropean or  Japanese  firms. 

Other  products  for  the  consumer  electronics  market  did  not 
become  as  controversial  as  color  televisions,  partly  because  the 
Japanese  had  pioneered  the  products.  Video  cassette  recorders, 
video  cameras,  and  compact  disc  players  were  all  developed  for 
the  consumer  market  by  Japanese  firms,  and  no  American-owned 
firms  were  involved  in  their  manufacture  in  the  1980s.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Japanese  overseas  investment  in  the  consumer  electronics  indus- 
try was  motivated  by  protectionism  and  labor  costs.  Protectionism 
was  the  main  motivation  for  Japanese  firms  to  establish  color  tele- 
vision plants  in  the  United  States.  By  1980,  after  the  three  years 
of  voluntary  export  restraints,  seven  Japanese  firms  had  located 
plants  in  the  United  States.  In  addition,  Japanese  firms  retained 
production  of  the  most  technologically  advanced  products  at  home, 
while  shifting  production  of  less  advanced  products  to  developing 
countries  such  as  Taiwan.  For  these  reasons,  Japanese  export  of 
color  televisions  fell  during  the  1980s,  from  2  percent  of  total  ex- 
ports in  1970  to  only  0.7  percent  in  1988. 

Computers 

Japan  was  a  latecomer  to  computer  manufacturing.  IBM  Japan, 
a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  IBM,  along  with  other  foreign  sub- 
sidiaries, originally  dominated  the  Japanese  market.  Until  the 
1980s,  Japanese  computer  manufacturers  viewed  their  marketing 
battle  as  one  of  capturing  Japan's  domestic  market  from  IBM 
Japan,  not  of  penetrating  world  markets.  However,  Japan's  in- 
dustry developed  with  extraordinary  speed  and  moved  into  inter- 
national markets.  The  leading  computer  manufacturers  in  Japan 
at  the  end  of  the  1980s  (by  sales  in  the  domestic  market)  were 
Fujitsu,  IBM  Japan,  Hitachi,  NEC,  and  Unisis,  in  mainframes, 
and  NEC,  Fujitsu,  Seiko  Epson,  Toshiba,  and  IBM  Japan  in  per- 
sonal computers.  Despite  the  benefits  extended  by  Japanese  indus- 
trial policy  to  the  domestic  computer  industry,  IBM  was  able  to 
maintain  a  significant  market  position  in  Japan — a  24  percent  share 
of  the  mainframe  market  and  a  6  percent  share  of  the  personal  com- 
puter market  in  1988. 

In  1988  Japan  exported  US$1.5  billion  of  computer  equipment, 
up  more  than  twelve-fold  from  the  US$122  million  in  1980. 
Japanese  firms  were  not  very  successful  in  exporting  mainframe 
computers,  but  did  very  well  in  peripheral  equipment,  such  as 
printers  and  tape  drives.  In  the  rapidly  growing  personal  computer 
market,  the  Japanese  achieved  a  modest  market  share  in  the  United 
States  during  the  1980s.  Imports  of  computer  equipment,  in  1988, 
came  to  US$3.2  billion  (including  parts).  However,  much  of  the 
computer  equipment  produced  by  foreign-owned  firms  that  was 
used  in  Japan  was  manufactured  domestically  by  subsidiaries  rather 
than  imported. 

The  special  treatment  extended  to  the  computer  industry  became 
the  subject  of  trade  disputes  with  the  United  States  in  the  1980s, 
in  particular,  government  procurement  practices  for  supercom- 
puters (the  fastest,  top-of-the-line  computers).  At  issue  was  the 


298

inability  of  American  manufacturers  to  sell  these  machines  to 
government-funded  agencies  in  Japan.  Some  rules  were  changed 
in  1987,  but  supercomputers  remained  one  of  three  products  sin- 
gled out  for  further  negotiation  by  the  United  States  in  1989  under 
the  provisions  of  the  1988  Trade  Act.  Earlier,  conflict  ensued  over 
a  Japanese  proposal  to  protect  computer  software  under  patent  law 
rather  than  under  copyright  law,  a  move  that  the  United  States 
felt  would  reduce  protection  for  American-designed  software  in  the 
Japanese  market.  This  issue  was  resolved  when  the  patent  law 
proposal  was  dropped. 

Semiconductors 

Semiconductor  devices  are  the  key  components  of  computers  and 
of  a  wide  variety  of  other  electronic  equipment.  Inasmuch  as  the 
entire  electronics  industry  was  considered  vital  to  the  health  and 
growth  of  the  economy,  semiconductors  received  significant  atten- 
tion in  Japan  during  the  1970s  and  1980s.  By  the  end  of  the  1980s, 
Japanese  firms  dominated  world  production  and  trade  in  certain 
segments  of  the  semiconductor  industry.  In  particular,  they  came 
to  dominate  the  world  market  in  dynamic  random-access  memory 
units  (DRAMs).  The  Japanese  share  of  the  world  merchant  mar- 
ket for  1 -megabit  DRAMs  at  the  end  of  the  decade,  for  example, 
was  estimated  at  90  percent,  while  other  estimates  put  the  Japanese 
share  of  all  semiconductor  devices  at  48  percent.  Trade  data  showed 
that  in  1988  Japan  exported  more  than  US$12  billion  in  semicon- 
ductor devices  (and  vacuum  tubes),  representing  a  dramatic  in- 
crease from  US$6  million  in  1960  and  just  over  US$2  billion  in 
1980.  Such  imports,  on  the  other  hand,  totaled  only  US$2.2  bil- 
lion in  the  same  year. 

The  rise  of  Japanese  competition  and  the  decline  in  the  world 
market  share  held  by  American  manufacturers,  coupled  with  alle- 
gations of  unfair  trade  practices,  made  semiconductors  a  conten- 
tious issue  between  the  United  States  and  Japan  throughout  the 
1980s.  The  allegations  included  charges  of  dumping  in  the  United 
States  market  and  of  import  barriers  artificially  limiting  the  mar- 
ket share  of  American  firms  selling  in  Japan.  Negotiations  in  1986 
produced  an  agreement  that  led  to  an  increase  in  Japanese  DRAM 
export  prices  and  that  also  included  a  provision  to  increase  the 
American  share  of  the  Japanese  market  (from  the  10  percent  that 
prevailed  at  that  time  to  20  percent  by  1991).  United  States  com- 
plaints that  the  Japanese  failed  to  carry  out  the  agreement  in  good 
faith  led  to  retaliation,  the  imposition  of  punitive  100  percent  tariffs 
on  US$300  million  of  Japanese  exports  to  the  United  States.  Evi- 
dence that  the  export  prices  of  DRAMs  had  risen  led  to  partial

elimination  of  the  sanctions,  but  others  remained  until  compliance 
was  seen  in  increasing  the  American  market  share  in  Japan.  This 
entire  episode  remained  very  controversial  at  the  end  of  the  de- 
cade, particularly  the  question  of  specifying  an  acceptable  market 
share  for  American  products  in  Japan. 

Iron  and  Steel 

Iron  and  steel  had  been  a  leading  industry  in  Japan  and  had 
been  considered  critical  to  economic  growth  by  the  Japanese  govern- 
ment in  the  1950s.  This  attitude,  exemplified  by  government  loans 
offered  at  favorable  rates,  led  to  rapid  modernization  and  expan- 
sion of  the  domestic  industry.  By  1970  iron  and  steel  were  the  lead- 
ing exports  from  Japan,  accounting  for  over  US$2.8  billion  or  14.7 
percent  of  total  exports.  This  export  share  peaked  in  1974,  at  19 
percent.  Because  of  both  the  domestic  industry's  strength  and  im- 
port barriers,  imports  of  iron  and  steel  represented  a  minimal 
US$276  million  in  1974.  Japan's  success  in  this  industry,  however, 
did  generate  large  imports  of  raw  materials — iron  ore  and  concen- 
trates, and  coking  coal.  Iron  and  steel  were  a  classic  case  of  a 
processing  trade,  with  Japan  importing  raw  materials,  building 
state-of-the-art,  integrated  steel  plants  at  harborside,  and  export- 
ing part  of  the  output  to  the  rest  of  the  world. 

Iron  and  steel  products  were  the  object  of  major  trade  disputes 
in  the  1970s.  The  United  States  steel  industry  alleged  that  the 
Japanese  engaged  in  dumping  to  increase  their  market  share  in 
the  United  States.  These  disputes  led  to  various  responses.  In  1978, 
the  United  States  government  instituted  the  "trigger  price  mech- 
anism": when  iron  and  steel  imports  reached  a  certain  low  price 
it  would  initiate  dumping  investigations,  effectively  setting  a  mini- 
mum price  for  imports.  These  prices  were  based  on  estimates  of 
Japanese  production  costs  because  the  Japanese  were  assumed  to 
be  the  lowest-cost  producer  in  the  world.  This  system  lasted  until 
the  early  1980s  and  was  replaced  in  1984  by  a  set  of  voluntary  ex- 
port restraints  negotiated  separately  with  major  suppliers  of  iron 
and  steel  to  the  United  States.  Japanese  shipments  to  the  United 
States  remained  subject  to  these  restraints  for  the  rest  of  the  decade. 

Despite  the  emphasis  placed  on  the  iron  and  steel  industry  in 
the  Japanese  economy  and  its  export  success,  the  industry  proved 
to  be  mature  and  declining  in  the  1980s.  Its  share  of  total  Japanese 
exports  slipped  to  only  5.8  percent  by  1988.  Imports  of  iron  and 
steel  to  Japan  rose  rapidly  in  the  1980s,  reaching  US$4.6  billion 
or  2.5  percent  of  total  imports.  South  Korea,  for  example,  was 
rapidly  moving  into  certain  parts  of  the  industry  and  managed  to 
penetrate  Japanese  markets  despite  opposition  from  the  Japanese

industry.  As  a  leader  in  steelmaking  technology  by  the  late  1970s, 
Japan  had  also  become  an  important  source  of  technology  for  South 
Korea,  China,  and  other  developing  nations  building  their  own 
steel  industries. 

Industries  of  the  Future 

The  Japanese  government  remained  actively  involved  in  shap- 
ing Japan's  economic  future.  Electronics  were  in  the  forefront  in 
the  1980s,  but  the  importance  of  other  industries  appeared  to  be 
rising  by  the  end  of  the  decade.  These  industries  included  compos- 
ite materials,  industrial  ceramics,  space  development  (including 
satellites  and  launch  vehicles),  and  superconductors  (and  products 
using  them,  such  as  magnetic  levitation  trains).  The  government's 
strong  belief  that  such  industries  will  be  critical  for  the  nation's 
future  will  likely  foster  active  participation  in  these  industries  by 
Japanese  firms.  As  these  industries  develop,  they  are  also  likely 
to  become  the  subject  of  trade  disputes  insofar  as  industrial  policy 
concerns  might  limit  imports  and  result  in  an  export  push  that  other 
nations  would  resent.  On  the  other  hand,  because  Japan  is  at  the 
technological  frontier  with  other  nations  in  these  industries,  Japa- 
nese development  might  produce  more  original  technologies  that 
other  nations  would  be  eager  to  acquire,  perhaps  creating  greater 
mutual  dependence.

Chapter  6.  The  Political  System 


Family  crest  of  a  double-petal  chrysanthemum  (kiku),  a  blossom  that  symbolizes 
nobility  and  purity;  used  by  the  imperial  family 


IN  1990,  JAPAN'S  oldest  living  person  was  Fujisawa  Mitsu,  113 
years  old.  In  the  year  of  her  birth,  1876  (the  ninth  year  of  the 
1868-1912  Meiji  era),  the  government  ended  the  special  status  of 
the  samurai,  taking  away  their  stipends  and  prohibiting  them  from 
wearing  swords.  Members  of  the  new  ruling  elite  traveled  to  Europe 
and  the  United  States  to  study  Western  political  ideas  and  institu- 
tions. Mitsu  was  thirteen  when  the  Meiji  Constitution  was  promul- 
gated, a  constitution  combining  traditional  nationalistic  thought 
with  German  legal  and  political  concepts.  The  most  influential 
Meiji-era  advocate  of  Anglo-American  liberalism,  Fukuzawa 
Yukichi,  died  in  1901  when  Mitsu  was  twenty-five.  She  was  middle- 
aged  when  political  parties  controlled  the  government  during  the 
"Taisho  democracy"  era  of  the  early  to  middle  1920s  and  revolu- 
tionary Marxism  was  popular  among  university  students  and  in- 
tellectuals. The  "Showa  fascism"  of  the  1930s  and  1940s  was  in 
large  measure  a  reaction  against  these  Westernizing  trends.  When 
General  Douglas  MacArthur  landed  in  Japan  and  began  the  United 
States  occupation  in  1945,  Mitsu  was  sixty-nine  years  old.  Her 
robust  old  age  witnessed  the  reintroduction  of  Western-style 
liberalism,  the  emergence  of  a  stable  parliamentary  system  under 
the  dominance  of  the  Liberal  Democratic  Party  (LDP — Jiyu- 
Minshuto),  the  rise  of  the  new  left,  and  postwar  Japan's  most  dra- 
matic episode  of  romantic  rightist  theater,  writer  Mishima  Yukio's 
self-immolation  in  1970. 

That  the  lifespan  of  a  single  person  could  encompass  such  dra- 
matic and  abrupt  changes  suggests  the  heterogeneity  of  contem- 
porary Japanese  political  values.  The  country  has  been  host  to  a 
wide  range  of  often  conflicting  foreign  influences:  Prussian  sta- 
tism,  French  radicalism,  Anglo-American  liberalism,  Marxism  and 
Marxism-Leninism,  and  European  fascism.  Mitsu  lived  to  see  the 
kokutai  (national  polity)  ideology  enshrined  in  the  Meiji  Constitu- 
tion and  overthrown  in  the  postwar  Constitution.  The  fact  that  a 
person  living  in  1990  had  been  born  in  the  twilight  of  Japan's  feu- 
dal regime  suggests  that  some  of  the  older  values  remained  viable. 
Certainly  Japan's  economic  dynamism  is  often  explained  in  terms 
of  the  coupling  of  feudal  values  with  the  efficiency  of  modern  or- 
ganization. Political  scientists  seeking  to  describe  the  distinctive 
features  of  Japanese  politics  also  point  to  the  feudal  legacy  behind 
them.  These  features  include  the  nature  of  decision  making,  the 
generally  pragmatic  spirit  of  Japanese  politics  and,  especially,  the 


305 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

post- 1955  successes  of  the  conservative  LDP,  which  has  epitomized 
feudal  personalism. 

Maintaining  power  uninterruptedly  for  nearly  four  decades,  the 
LDP  was  able  to  promote  a  highly  stable  policy-making  process. 
Its  leaders  functioned  as  brokers,  joining  the  expertise  of  the  elite 
civil  service  with  the  demands  of  important  interest  groups.  The 
role  of  these  leaders,  however,  was  not  passive.  Since  the  1960s, 
the  party's  policy-making  power  has  increased  while  that  of  the 
bureaucracy  has  declined.  Although  political  scandals  were  frequent, 
tarnishing  the  general  image  of  politicians,  the  system  succeeded 
in  providing  most  groups  in  society  with  adequate  representation 
and  a  share  of  prosperity.  The  Japanese  middle-class  in  the  early 
1990s  was  large  and  stable. 

At  the  same  time,  opposition  parties  were  divided  and  gener- 
ally ineffectual.  Although  they  performed  an  important  monitor- 
ing function,  they  seemed  in  the  early  1990s  incapable  of  joining 
forces  or  providing  a  credible  alternative  to  the  ruling  party.  The 
general  election  of  February  18,  1990  still  gave  the  scandal- shaken 
LDP  a  stable  majority  in  the  lower  house,  making  it  likely  that 
not  only  Mitsu's  great- great- grandchildren,  but  also  her  great-great- 
great  grandchildren,  would  grow  to  maturity  under  a  LDP  prime 
minister. 

The  Postwar  Constitution 

On  July  26,  1945,  Allied  leaders  Winston  Churchill,  Harry  S. 
Truman,  and  Joseph  Stalin  issued  the  Potsdam  Declaration,  which 
demanded  Japan's  unconditional  surrender.  This  declaration  also 
defined  the  major  goals  of  the  postsurrender  Allied  occupation: 
"The  Japanese  government  shall  remove  all  obstacles  to  the  revival 
and  strengthening  of  democratic  tendencies  among  the  Japanese 
people.  Freedom  of  speech,  of  religion,  and  of  thought,  as  well  as 
respect  for  the  fundamental  human  rights  shall  be  established"  (Sec- 
tion 10).  In  addition,  this  document  stated:  "The  occupying  forces 
of  the  Allies  shall  be  withdrawn  from  Japan  as  soon  as  these  objec- 
tives have  been  accomplished  and  there  has  been  established  in  ac- 
cordance with  the  freely  expressed  will  of  the  Japanese  people  a 
peacefully  inclined  and  responsible  government"  (Section  12).  The 
Allies  sought  not  merely  punishment  or  reparations  from  a  milita- 
ristic foe,  but  fundamental  changes  in  the  nature  of  its  political 
system.  In  the  words  of  political  scientist  Robert  Ward:  "The  oc- 
cupation was  perhaps  the  single  most  exhaustively  planned  opera- 
tion of  massive  and  externally  directed  political  change  in  world 
history."

The  Political  System 


The  wording  of  the  Potsdam  Declaration — "The  Japanese 
Government  shall  remove  all  obstacles  .  .  ." — and  the  initial  post- 
surrender  measures  taken  by  MacArthur,  the  Supreme  Commander 
for  the  Allied  Powers  (SCAP),  suggest  that  neither  he  nor  his 
superiors  in  Washington  intended  to  impose  a  new  political  sys- 
tem on  Japan  unilaterally.  Instead,  they  wished  to  encourage  new 
Japanese  leaders  to  initiate  democratic  reforms  on  their  own.  But 
by  early  1946,  MacArthur' s  staff  and  Japanese  officials  were  at 
odds  over  the  most  fundamental  issue,  the  writing  of  a  new  consti- 
tution. Prime  Minister  Shidehara  Kijuro  and  many  of  his  colleagues 
were  extremely  reluctant  to  take  the  drastic  step  of  replacing  the 
1889  Meiji  Constitution  with  a  more  liberal  document.  In  late  1945, 
Shidehara  appointed  Matsumoto  Joji,  state  minister  without  port- 
folio, head  of  a  blue-ribbon  committee  of  constitutional  scholars 
to  suggest  revisions.  The  Matsumoto  Commission's  recommen- 
dations, made  public  in  February  1946,  were  quite  conservative 
(described  by  one  Japanese  scholar  in  the  late  1980s  as  "no  more 
than  a  touching-up  of  the  Meiji  Constitution").  MacArthur  re- 
jected them  outright  and  ordered  his  staff  to  draft  a  completely  new 
document.  This  was  presented  to  surprised  Japanese  officials  on 
February  13,  1946. 

The  MacArthur  draft,  which  proposed  a  unicameral  legislature, 
was  changed  at  the  insistence  of  the  Japanese  to  allow  a  bicameral 
legislature,  both  houses  being  elected.  In  most  other  important 
respects,  however,  the  ideas  embodied  in  the  February  13  docu- 
ment were  adopted  by  the  government  in  its  own  draft  proposal 
of  March  6.  These  included  the  Constitution's  most  distinctive  fea- 
tures: the  symbolic  role  of  the  emperor,  the  prominence  of  guaran- 
tees of  civil  and  human  rights,  and  the  renunciation  of  war.  The 
new  document  was  approved  by  the  Privy  Council,  the  House  of 
Peers,  and  the  House  of  Representatives,  the  major  organs  of 
government  in  the  1889  constitution,  and  promulgated  on  Novem- 
ber 3,  1946,  to  go  into  effect  on  May  3,  1947.  Technically,  the 
1947  Constitution  was  an  amendment  to  the  1889  document  rather 
than  its  abrogation. 

The  new  Constitution  would  not  have  been  written  as  it  was  had 
MacArthur  and  his  staff  allowed  Japanese  politicians  and  constitu- 
tional experts  to  resolve  the  issue  as  they  wished.  The  document's 
foreign  origins  have,  understandably,  been  a  focus  of  controversy 
since  Japan  recovered  its  sovereignty  in  1952.  Yet  in  late  1945  and 
1946,  there  was  much  public  discussion  on  constitutional  reform, 
and  the  MacArthur  draft  was  apparently  greatly  influenced  by  the 
ideas  of  certain  Japanese  liberals.  The  MacArthur  draft  did  not 
attempt  to  impose  an  American- style  presidential  or  federal  system. 


307 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


Instead,  the  proposed  Constitution  conformed  to  the  British  model 
of  parliamentary  government,  which  was  seen  by  the  liberals  as 
the  most  viable  alternative  to  the  European  absolutism  of  the  Meiji 
Constitution. 

After  1952  conservatives  and  nationalists  attempted  to  revise  the 
Constitution  to  make  it  more  ' 'Japanese,"  but  these  attempts  were 
frustrated  for  a  number  of  reasons.  One  was  the  extreme  difficulty 
of  amending  it.  Amendments  require  approval  by  two-thirds  of 
the  members  of  both  houses  of  the  National  Diet  (see  Glossary; 
The  Legislature,  this  ch.),  before  they  can  be  presented  to  the  people 
in  a  referendum  (Article  96).  Also,  opposition  parties,  occupying 
more  than  one- third  of  the  Diet  seats,  were  firm  supporters  of  the 
constitutional  status  quo.  Even  for  members  of  the  ruling  LDP, 
the  Constitution  was  not  disadvantageous.  They  had  been  able  to 
fashion  a  policy-making  process  congenial  to  their  interests  within 
its  framework.  Nakasone  Yasuhiro,  a  strong  advocate  of  constitu- 
tional revision  during  much  of  his  political  career,  for  example, 
downplayed  the  issue  while  serving  as  prime  minister  between  1982 
and  1987. 

The  Status  of  the  Emperor 

In  the  Meiji  Constitution,  the  emperor  was  sovereign  and  the 
locus  of  the  state's  legitimacy:  as  the  preamble  stated,  "The  rights 
of  sovereignty  of  the  State,  We  have  inherited  from  Our  Ances- 
tors, and  We  shall  bequeath  them  to  Our  descendants."  In  the 
postwar  Constitution,  the  emperor's  role  in  the  political  system  was 
drastically  redefined.  A  prior  and  important  step  in  this  process 
was  Emperor  Hirohito's  1946  New  Year's  speech,  made  at  the 
prompting  of  MacArthur,  renouncing  his  status  as  a  divine  ruler. 
Hirohito  declared  that  relations  between  the  ruler  and  his  people 
cannot  be  based  on  "the  false  conception  that  the  emperor  is  di- 
vine or  that  the  Japanese  people  are  superior  to  other  races." 

In  the  first  article  of  the  new  Constitution,  the  newly  "hu- 
manized" ruler  is  described  as  "the  symbol  of  the  State  and  of 
the  unity  of  the  people,  deriving  his  position  from  the  will  of  the 
people  with  whom  resides  sovereign  power. "  The  authority  of  the 
emperor  as  sovereign  in  the  1 889  constitution  was  broad  and  un- 
defined. His  functions  under  the  postwar  system  are  narrow,  spe- 
cific, and  largely  ceremonial,  confined  to  such  activities  as  convening 
the  Diet  bestowing  decorations  on  deserving  citizens,  and  receiv- 
ing foreign  ambassadors  (Article  7).  He  does  not  possess  "powers 
related  to  government"  (Article  4).  The  change  in  the  emperor's 
status  was  designed  to  preclude  the  possibility  of  military  or 
bureaucratic  cliques  exercising  broad  and  irresponsible  powers  "in

the  emperor's  name" — a  prominent  feature  of  1930s  extremism. 
The  Constitution  defines  the  Diet  as  the  "highest  organ  of  state 
power"  (Article  41),  accountable  not  to  the  monarch  but  to  the 
people  who  elected  its  members. 

The  use  of  the  Japanese  word  shocho,  meaning  symbol,  to  describe 
the  emperor  is  unusual  and — depending  upon  one's  viewpoint — 
conveniently  or  frustratingly  vague.  The  emperor  is  neither  head 
of  state  nor  sovereign,  as  are  many  European  constitutional 
monarchs,  although  in  October  1988  Japan's  Ministry  of  Foreign 
Affairs  claimed,  controversially,  that  the  emperor  is  the  country's 
sovereign  in  the  context  of  its  external  relations.  Nor  does  the  em- 
peror have  an  official  priestly  or  religious  role.  Although  he  con- 
tinues to  perform  ancient  rituals,  such  as  ceremonial  planting  of 
the  rice  crop  in  spring,  he  does  so  in  a  private  capacity. 

Laws  relating  to  the  imperial  house  must  be  approved  by  the 
Diet.  Under  the  old  system,  the  Imperial  House  Law  was  separate 
from  and  equal  with  the  constitution.  After  the  war,  the  imperial 
family's  extensive  estates  were  confiscated  and  its  finances  placed 
under  control  of  the  Imperial  Household  Agency,  part  of  the  Office 
of  the  Prime  Minister  and  theoretically  subject  to  the  Diet.  In  prac- 
tice, the  agency  in  the  early  1990s  remained  a  bastion  of  conser- 
vatism, its  officials  shrouding  the  activities  of  the  emperor  and  his

being  the  crest  of  the  imperial  house)  to  maintain  an  aura  of  sanc- 
tity. Despite  knowledge  of  his  illness  among  the  press  corps  and 
other  observers,  details  about  the  late  Emperor  Hirohito's  state  of 
health  in  1988  and  1989  were  tightly  controlled.  In  the  early  1990s, 
the  use  of  the  masculine  pronoun  to  describe  the  emperor  was  ap- 
propriate because  the  Imperial  Household  Law  still  restricted  the 
succession  to  males — despite  the  fact  that  in  earlier  centuries  some 
of  Japan's  rulers  had  been  women  (see  Nara  and  Heian  Periods, 
A.D.  710-1185,  ch.  1). 

The  emperor's  constitutional  status  became  a  focus  of  renewed 
public  attention  following  news  of  Hirohito's  serious  illness  in  late 
1988.  Crown  Prince  Akihito  became  the  first  person  to  ascend  the 
throne  under  the  postwar  system.  One  important  symbolic  issue 
was  the  choice  of  a  new  reign  title  under  the  gengo  system — bor- 
rowed originally  from  imperial  China  and  used  before  1945 — which 
enumerates  years  beginning  with  the  first  year  of  a  monarch's  reign. 
Thus  1988  was  Showa  63,  the  sixty-third  year  of  the  reign  of 
Hirohito,  the  Showa  Emperor.  The  accession  of  a  new  monarch 
is  marked  by  the  naming  of  a  new  era  that  consists  of  two  auspi- 
cious Chinese  characters.  Showa,  for  example,  means  bright  har- 
mony. Critics  deplored  the  secrecy  with  which  such  titles  were 
chosen  in  the  past,  the  decision  being  left  to  a  government-appointed 
committee  of  experts,  and  advocated  public  discussion  of  the  choice 
as  a  reflection  of  Japan's  democratic  values.  Although  the  gengo 
system  was  accorded  official  status  by  a  bill  the  Diet  passed  in  June 
1979,  some  favored  the  system's  abandonment  altogether  in 
favor  of  the  Western  calendar.  But  on  January  7,  1989,  the  day 
of  Hirohito's  death,  the  government  announced  that  Heisei  (Achiev- 
ing Peace)  was  the  new  era  name.  The  first  year  of  Heisei  thus 
was  1989,  and  all  official  documents  were  so  dated. 

Still  more  controversial  were  the  ceremonies  held  in  connection 
with  the  late  emperor's  funeral  and  the  new  emperor's  accession. 
State  support  of  these  activities  would  have  violated  Article  20  of 
the  Constitution  on  the  separation  of  state  and  religious  activities. 
Rightists,  such  as  members  of  the  Society  to  Protect  Japan  (Nihon 
o  Mamoru  Kai),  a  nationwide  lobbying  group,  demanded  full  pub- 
lic support  of  the  ceremonies  as  expression  of  the  people's  love  for 
their  monarch.  Walking  a  tightrope  between  pro-Constitution  and 
rightist  groups,  the  government  chose  to  divide  Hirohito's  state 
funeral,  held  February  24,  1989,  into  official  and  religious  com- 
ponents. Akihito 's  accession  to  the  throne  in  November  1990  also 
had  religious  (Shinto)  and  secular  components:  the  Sokui-no- 
rei,  or  Enthronement  Ceremony,  was  secular;  the  Daijosai,  or  Great 


310 


The  Political  System 


Thanksgiving  Festival — traditionally,  a  communion  between  the 
new  monarch  and  the  gods  in  which  the  monarch  himself  became 
a  deity — was  religious.  The  government's  decision  to  use  public 
funds  not  only  for  the  Sokui-no-rei  but  also  for  the  Daijosai,  justi- 
fied in  terms  of  the  "public  nature"  of  both  ceremonies,  was  seen 
by  religious  and  opposition  groups  as  a  serious  violation  of  Article 
20. 

In  the  early  1990s,  an  array  of  such  symbolic  political  issues 
brought  attention  to  the  state's  role  in  religious  or  quasi-religious 
activities.  Defenders  of  the  Constitution,  including  Japanese  Chris- 
tians, followers  of  new  religions,  leftists,  and  many  members  of 
the  political  opposition,  considered  any  government  involvement 
in  religious  aspects  of  the  enthronement  to  be  a  conservative  at- 
tempt to  undermine  the  spirit,  if  not  the  letter,  of  the  Constitu- 
tion. They  also  strongly  criticized  the  1989  Ministry  of  Education, 
Science,  and  Culture's  controversial  directive,  which  called  for  the 
playing  of  the  prewar  national  anthem  ("Kimigayo,"  or  "The 
Sovereign's  Reign")  and  display  of  the  rising  sun  flag  (Hinomaru, 
the  use  of  which  dates  to  the  early  nineteenth  century)  at  public 
school  ceremonies.  Although  since  the  late  1950s,  these  activities 
had  been  described  by  the  ministry  as  "desirable,"  neither  had 
legal  status  under  the  postwar  Constitution. 

Another  issue  was  state  support  for  the  Yasukuni  Shrine.  This 
shrine,  located  in  Tokyo  near  the  Imperial  Palace,  was  established 
during  the  Meiji  era  as  a  repository  for  the  souls  of  soldiers  and 
sailors  who  died  in  battle,  thus  a  holy  place  rather  than  simply  a 
war  memorial.  Conservatives  introduced  bills  five  times  during  the 
1970s  to  make  it  a  "national  establishment,"  but  none  was  adopted. 
On  the  fortieth  anniversary  of  the  end  of  World  War  II,  August  15, 
1985,  Prime  Minister  Nakasone  Yasuhiro  and  members  of  his  cabi- 
net visited  the  shrine  in  an  official  capacity,  an  action  viewed  as 
a  renewed  conservative  effort,  outside  the  Diet,  to  invest  the  shrine 
with  official  status. 

Despite  the  veneer  of  Westernization  and  Article  20 's  prohi- 
bition of  state  support  of  the  emperor's  religious  or  ceremonial 
activities,  his  postwar  role  was  in  some  ways  more  like  that 
of  traditional  rather  than  prewar  emperors.  During  the  Meiji 
(1868-1912),  Taisho  (1912-26),  and  early  Showa  (1926-89)  eras, 
the  emperor  himself  was  not  actively  involved  in  politics.  His  po- 
litical authority,  however,  was  immense,  and  military  and  bureau- 
cratic elites  acted  in  his  name.  The  "symbolic"  role  of  the  emperor 
after  1945,  however,  recalled  feudal  Japan,  where  political  power 
was  monopolized  and  exercised  by  the  shoguns,  and  the  imperial 
court  carried  on  a  leisurely,  apolitical  existence  in  the  ancient  capital

of  Kyoto  and  served  as  patrons  of  culture  and  the  arts  (see 
Kamakura  and  Muromachi  Periods,  1185-1573,  ch.  1;  Religious 
and  Philosophical  Traditions,  ch.  2). 

Emperor  Akihito,  in  an  effort  to  put  a  modern  face  on  the 
Japanese  monarchy,  held  a  press  conference  on  August  7,  1989, 
his  first  since  ascending  to  the  throne.  He  expressed  his  determi- 
nation to  respect  the  Constitution  and  promote  international  un- 
derstanding. 

The  Article  9  "No  War"  Clause 

Another  distinctive  feature  of  the  Constitution,  and  one  that  has 
generated  as  much  controversy  as  the  status  of  the  emperor,  is  the 
Article  9  "No  War"  clause.  It  contains  two  paragraphs:  the  first 
states  that  the  Japanese  people  "forever  renounce  war  as  a  sover- 
eign right  of  the  nation  and  the  threat  or  use  of  force  as  a  means 
of  settling  international  disputes,"  the  second  that  "land,  sea,  and 
air  forces,  as  well  as  other  war  potential  will  never  be  maintained. " 
Some  historians  attribute  the  inclusion  of  Article  9  to  Charles  Kades, 
one  of  MacArthur's  closest  associates,  who  was  impressed  by  the 
spirit  of  the  1928  Kellogg-Briand  Pact  renouncing  war  (see 
Diplomacy,  ch.  1).  MacArthur  himself  claimed  that  the  idea  had 
been  suggested  to  him  by  Prime  Minister  Shidehara.  The  article's 
acceptance  by  the  Japanese  government  may  in  part  be  explained 
by  the  desire  to  protect  the  imperial  throne.  Some  Allied  leaders 
saw  the  emperor  as  the  primary  factor  in  Japan's  warlike  behavior. 
His  assent  to  the  "No  War"  clause  weakened  their  arguments  in 
favor  of  abolishing  the  throne  or  trying  the  emperor  as  a  war  crim- 
inal. 

Article  9  has  had  broad  implications  for  foreign  policy,  the  in- 
stitution of  judicial  review  as  exercised  by  the  Supreme  Court,  the 
status  of  the  Self-Defense  Forces,  and  the  nature  and  tactics  of  op- 
position politics  (see  Major  Foreign  Policy  Goals  and  Strategies, 
ch.  7;  The  Self-Defense  Forces,  ch.  8).  During  the  late  1980s,  in- 
creases in  government  appropriations  for  the  Self-Defense  Forces 
averaged  more  than  5  percent  per  year.  By  the  early  1990s,  Japan 
was  ranked  third,  behind  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States, 
in  total  defense  expenditures,  and  the  United  States  urged  Japan 
to  assume  a  larger  share  of  the  burden  of  defense  of  the  western 
Pacific.  Given  these  circumstances,  some  have  viewed  Article  9  as 
increasingly  irrelevant.  It  has  remained,  however,  an  important 
brake  on  the  growth  of  Japan's  military  capabilities.  Despite  the 
fading  of  bitter  wartime  memories,  the  general  public,  according 
to  opinion  polls,  continued  to  show  strong  support  for  this  con- 
stitutional provision.

Rights  and  Duties  of  Citizens 

"The  rights  and  duties  of  the  people"  are  prominently  featured 
in  the  postwar  Constitution.  Altogether,  31  of  its  103  articles  are 
devoted  to  describing  them  in  considerable  detail,  reflecting  the 
commitment  to  "respect  for  the  fundamental  human  rights"  of 
the  Potsdam  Declaration.  Although  the  Meiji  Constitution  had  a 
section  devoted  to  the  "rights  and  duties  of  subjects,"  which  guaran- 
teed "liberty  of  speech,  writing,  publication,  public  meetings,  and 
associations,"  these  rights  were  granted  "within  the  limits  of  law." 
Freedom  of  religious  belief  was  allowed  "insofar  as  it  does  not  in- 
terfere with  the  duties  of  subjects"  (all  Japanese  were  required  to 
acknowledge  the  emperor's  divinity,  and  those,  such  as  Christians, 
who  refused  to  do  so  out  of  religious  conviction  were  accused  of 
lese-majeste). 

Such  freedoms  are  delineated  in  the  postwar  Constitution  without 
qualification.  In  addition,  the  later  Constitution  guarantees  free- 
dom of  thought  and  conscience;  academic  freedom;  the  prohibi- 
tion of  discrimination  based  on  race,  creed,  social  status,  or  family 
origin;  and  a  number  of  what  could  be  called  welfare  rights:  the 


313 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


right  to  "minimum  standards  of  wholesome  and  cultured  living," 
the  right  to  "equal  education,"  the  "right  and  obligation  to  work" 
according  to  fixed  standards  of  labor  and  wages,  and  the  right  of 
workers  to  organize.  Equality  of  the  sexes  and  the  right  of  mar- 
riage based  on  mutual  consent  (in  contrast  to  arranged  marriage 
in  the  most  traditional  sense,  in  which  families  decide  on  the  match) 
are  also  recognized.  Limitations  are  placed  on  personal  freedoms 
only  insofar  as  they  are  not  abused  (Article  12)  or  interfere  with 
public  welfare  (Article  13).  The  bestowal  of  the  power  of  judicial 
review  on  the  Supreme  Court  (Article  81)  is  in  part  meant  to  serve 
as  a  means  of  defending  individual  rights  from  infringement  by 
public  authorities  (see  The  Judicial  System,  this  ch.). 

Some  United  States  origins  of  the  Constitution  are  revealed  in 
the  phraseology  of  Article  13,  which  states  that  the  right  of  the  people 
to  "life,  liberty,  and  the  pursuit  of  happiness"  shall  be  the  "supreme 
consideration  in  legislation  and  other  governmental  affairs."  It  was 
with  some  awkwardness  that  such  concepts  were  translated  into 
Japanese.  Yet  the  document  goes  further  in  enumerating  rights 
than  do  the  United  States  and  many  other  Western  constitutions. 
For  example,  the  article  pertaining  to  equality  of  the  sexes  (Arti- 
cle 14)  bans  sexual  (as  well  as  racial,  religious,  and  social)  discrimi- 
nation "in  political,  economic,  or  social  relations"  as  clearly  as 
the  proposed  United  States  equal  rights  amendment,  which  failed 
to  be  ratified  during  the  1970s  and  1980s.  Unlike  their  Japanese 
counterparts,  United  States  schoolteachers  and  university  profes- 
sors are  not  protected  by  a  special  provision  on  academic  freedom 
(Article  23).  Instead,  American  teaching  and  research  activities  are 
subsumed  under  the  more  general  guarantee  of  freedom  of  speech 
in  the  First  Amendment. 

The  Structure  of  Government 

The  Legislature 

Article  41  of  the  Constitution  describes  the  National  Diet,  or 
national  legislature,  as  "the  highest  organ  of  state  power"  and  "the 
sole  law-making  organ  of  the  State"  (see  fig.  7).  This  statement 
is  in  forceful  contrast  to  the  Meiji  Constitution,  which  described 
the  emperor  as  the  one  who  exercised  legislative  power  with  the 
consent  of  the  Diet.  The  Diet's  responsibilities  include  not  only 
the  making  of  laws  but  also  the  approval  of  the  annual  national 
budget  that  the  government  submits  and  the  ratification  of  treaties. 
It  can  also  initiate  draft  constitutional  amendments,  which,  if  ap- 
proved, must  be  presented  to  the  people  in  a  referendum.  The  Diet 
may  conduct  "investigations  in  relation  to  government"  (Article 


314 


The  Political  System 


62).  The  prime  minister  must  be  designated  by  Diet  resolution, 
establishing  the  principle  of  legislative  supremacy  over  executive 
government  agencies  (Article  67).  The  government  can  also  be  dis- 
solved by  the  Diet  if  it  passes  a  motion  of  no  confidence  introduced 
by  fifty  members  of  the  House  of  Representatives,  the  lower  cham- 
ber. Government  officials,  including  the  prime  minister  and  cabi- 
net members,  are  required  to  appear  before  Diet  investigative 
committees  and  answer  inquiries.  The  Diet  also  has  the  power  to 
impeach  judges  convicted  of  criminal  or  irregular  conduct. 

Japan's  legislature  is  bicameral.  Both  the  upper  house,  the  House 
of  Councillors,  and  the  lower  house,  the  House  of  Representatives, 
are  elective  bodies.  The  Constitution's  Article  14  declares  that 
' 4 peers  and  peerages  shall  not  be  recognized."  Upon  its  enactment, 
the  old  House  of  Peers  was  abolished.  Members  of  the  two  new 
houses  are  elected  by  universal  adult  suffrage,  and  secrecy  of  the 
ballot  is  guaranteed  (Article  15).  The  term  of  the  House  of  Repre- 
sentatives is  four  years.  It  may  be  dissolved  earlier,  however,  if 
the  prime  minister  or  members  of  the  House  of  Representatives 
decide  to  hold  a  general  election  before  the  expiration  of  that  term 
(Article  7).  Multiple  representatives  are  elected  from  130  con- 
stituencies based  theoretically  on  population  (see  The  Electoral 
System,  this  ch.).  In  1990  the  House  of  Representatives  had  512 
members. 

Members  of  the  House  of  Councillors  have  six-year  terms.  One 
half  of  these  terms  expire  every  three  years.  There  are  two  types 
of  constituencies  in  the  upper  house:  prefectural  constituencies,  for 
the  forty-seven  prefectures  and  districts,  represented  by  152  coun- 
cillors, apportioned  according  to  the  district  populations;  and  a  na- 
tional "proportional  representation"  constituency,  represented  by 
100  councillors,  which  yields  a  total  of  252.  The  proportional 
representation  system,  introduced  in  1982,  was  the  first  major  elec- 
toral reform  under  the  postwar  Constitution.  Instead  of  choosing 
national  constituency  candidates  as  individuals,  as  had  previously 
been  the  case,  voters  cast  ballots  for  parties.  Individual  council- 
lors, listed  officially  by  the  parties  before  the  election,  are  selected 
on  the  basis  of  the  parties'  proportions  of  the  total  national  constit- 
uency vote.  The  system  was  introduced  to  reduce  the  excessive 
money  spent  by  candidates  for  the  national  constituencies.  Critics 
charged,  however,  that  this  new  system  benefited  the  two  largest 
parties,  the  LDP  and  Japan  Socialist  Party  (Nihon  Shakaito),  which 
in  fact  had  sponsored  the  reform. 

The  House  of  Representatives  has  the  greater  power  of  the  two 
contemporary  houses,  in  contrast  to  the  prewar  system  in  which 
the  two  houses  had  equal  status.  According  to  Article  59,  a  bill

that  is  approved  by  the  House  of  Representatives  but  turned  down 
by  the  House  of  Councillors  returns  to  the  House  of  Representa- 
tives. If  the  latter  passes  the  bill  with  a  two- thirds  or  higher  majority 
on  this  second  ballot,  the  bill  becomes  law.  However,  three  im- 
portant exceptions  to  the  principle  exist,  covering  the  approval  of 
the  budget,  adoption  of  treaties  with  foreign  countries,  and  the  selec- 
tion of  the  prime  minister.  In  all  three  cases,  if  the  upper  and  lower 
houses  have  a  disagreement  that  is  not  resolved  by  a  joint  com- 
mittee of  the  two  houses,  then  after  a  lapse  of  thirty  days  "the  de- 
cision of  the  House  of  Representatives  shall  be  the  decision  of  the 
Diet"  (Articles  60,  61,  and  67).  Budgeting  is  an  important  annual 
political  function,  setting  both  taxes  and  the  allowable  expenditures 
of  all  segments  of  the  central  government,  and  the  impotence  of 
the  upper  house  has  been  demonstrated  on  a  number  of  occasions. 
Nevertheless,  the  House  of  Councillors,  with  its  fixed  terms,  can- 
not be  dissolved  by  the  prime  minister.  In  times  of  emergency, 
the  cabinet  may  convene  the  House  of  Councillors  rather  than  the 
House  of  Representatives  (Article  54). 

In  the  July  23,  1989,  election  for  half  the  members  of  the  House 
of  Councillors,  the  LDP  lost  its  majority.  It  won  only  36  of  the 
126  seats  contested  in  the  prefectural  and  national  constituencies, 
while  the  opposition  parties  together  won  90;  the  largest  opposi- 
tion party,  the  Japan  Socialist  Party,  won  46  (see  table  36,  Ap- 
pendix). This  result  gave  an  admittedly  unstable  coalition  of 
opposition  groups  the  opportunity  to  use  the  limited  powers  of  the 
upper  house  to  delay  or  frustrate  initiatives  taken  in  the  LDP- 
dominated  lower  house.  On  August  9,  1989,  for  the  first  time  in 
forty-one  years,  the  two  houses  nominated  two  different  candidates 
for  prime  minister — Kaifu  Toshiki  of  the  LDP  and  Doi  Takako 
of  the  Japan  Socialist  Party.  Although  Kaifu  was  finally  chosen 
because  of  the  principle  of  lower  house  supremacy,  the  events 
showed  how  opposition  control  of  the  upper  house  could  compli- 
cate the  political  process.  In  March  1990,  the  upper  house  rejected 
a  supplementary  budget  bill  for  fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glossary)  1989 
that  had  been  proposed  by  the  lower  house.  Although  the  bill  was 
eventually  approved  despite  upper  house  rejection,  the  wrangling 
caused  some  minor  inconvenience  to  the  country's  more  than  1 
million  national  civil  servants  whose  monthly  salary  payments  were 
delayed.  The  more  serious  upheaval,  that  might  have  occurred  had 
there  been  a  real  deadlock  or  a  potential  shift  in  fiscal  policies 
brought  about  by  the  opposition  parties,  was  avoided. 

The  Cabinet  and  Ministries 

In  the  postwar  political  system,  executive  power  is  vested  in  the 
cabinet.  The  cabinet  head  is  the  prime  minister,  responsible  for 


317 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

appointing  and  dismissing  other  cabinet  members.  Cabinet 
ministers  include  those  appointed  to  head  the  ministries,  twelve 
in  number,  and  ministers  of  state  placed  in  charge  of  the  commis- 
sions and  agencies  of  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  which  itself 
has  the  status  of  a  ministry.  They  include  the  director  general  of 
the  Defense  Agency,  equivalent  to  a  minister  of  defense  but  lack- 
ing ministerial  status  (a  reflection  of  the  Article  9  renunciation  of 
war).  Also  among  the  ministers  of  state  are  the  chief  cabinet  secre- 
tary, who  coordinates  the  activities  of  the  ministries  and  agencies, 
conducts  policy  research,  and  prepares  materials  to  be  discussed 
at  cabinet  meetings,  and  the  director  of  the  Cabinet  Legislative 
Bureau,  who  advises  cabinet  members  on  drafting  the  legislation 
to  be  proposed  to  the  Diet.  Although  the  chief  cabinet  secretary 
does  not  have  ministerial  rank,  the  position  is  influential  within 
the  cabinet  because  of  its  coordination  role. 

The  Board  of  Audit  reviews  government  expenditures  and  sub- 
mits an  annual  report  to  the  Diet.  The  1947  Board  of  Audit  Law 
gives  this  body  substantial  independence  from  both  cabinet  and 
Diet  control.  The  Security  Council  advises  the  prime  minister  on 
salaries  and  other  matters  pertaining  to  national  government  civil 
servants.  Semiautonomous  public  corporations — including  public 
housing  corporations,  financial  institutions,  and  Japan  Broadcasting 
Corporation  (Nippon  Hoso  Kyokai — NHK,  which  was  the  sole, 
noncommercial  public  radio  and  television  broadcasting  system) — 
had  been  reduced  in  number  by  the  privatization  of  Japan  Airlines, 
the  Japanese  National  Railways,  the  Japan  Tobacco  and  Salt  Public 
Corporation,  and  Nippon  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Corporation 
during  the  1980s,  but  there  still  remained  ninety-seven  such  or- 
ganizations in  1988. 

National  government  civil  servants  are  divided  into  "special" 
and  "regular"  categories.  Appointments  in  the  special  category 
are  governed  by  political  or  other  factors  and  do  not  involve  ex- 
aminations. This  category  includes  cabinet  ministers,  heads  of  in- 
dependent agencies,  members  of  the  Self-Defense  Forces,  Diet 
officials,  and  ambassadors.  The  core  of  the  civil  service  is  com- 
posed of  members  of  the  regular  category,  who  are  recruited  through 
competitive  examinations.  This  group  is  further  divided  into  junior 
service  and  upper  professional  levels,  the  latter  forming  a  well- 
defined  civil  service  elite  (see  The  Civil  Service,  this  ch.). 

Local  Government 

As  of  1990,  Japan  was  divided  into  forty-seven  administrative 
divisions:  one  metropolitan  district  {to — Tokyo),  two  urban  prefec- 
tures (fu — Kyoto  and  Osaka),  forty-three  regular  prefectures  (ken), 


318 


The  Political  System 


and  one  district  (do — Hokkaido)  (see  fig.  8).  Large  cities  were  sub- 
divided into  wards  (ku),  and  further  split  into  precincts  (machi  or 
cho),  or  subdistricts  (shicho)  and  counties  (gun). 

Each  of  the  forty-seven  local  jurisdictions  has  a  governor  and 
a  unicameral  assembly,  both  elected  by  popular  vote  every  four 
years.  All  are  required  by  national  law  to  maintain  departments 
of  general  affairs,  finance,  welfare,  health,  and  labor.  Departments 
of  agriculture,  fisheries,  forestry,  commerce,  and  industry  are  op- 
tional, depending  on  local  needs.  The  governor  is  responsible  for 
all  activities  supported  through  local  taxation  or  the  national 
government. 

Cities  (shi)  are  self-governing  units  administered  independently 
of  the  larger  jurisdictions  within  which  they  are  located.  In  order 
to  attain  shi  status,  a  jurisdiction  must  have  at  least  30,000  inhabi- 
tants, 60  percent  of  whom  are  engaged  in  urban  occupations.  City 
government  is  headed  by  a  mayor  elected  for  four  years  by  popu- 
lar vote.  There  are  also  popularly  elected  city  assemblies.  The  wards 
(ku)  of  larger  cities  also  elect  their  own  assemblies,  which  select  ward 
superintendents . 

The  terms  machi  and  cho  designate  self-governing  towns  outside 
the  cities  as  well  as  precincts  of  urban  wards.  Like  the  cities,  each 
has  its  own  elected  mayor  and  assembly.  Villages  (son  or  mura)  are 
the  smallest  self-governing  entities  in  rural  areas.  They  often  con- 
sist of  a  number  of  rural  hamlets  (buraku)  containing  several  thou- 
sand people  connected  to  one  another  through  the  formally  imposed 
framework  of  village  administration.  Villages  have  mayors  and 
councils  elected  to  four-years  terms. 

Japan  has  a  unitary  rather  than  federal  system  of  government, 
in  which  local  jurisdictions  largely  depend  on  national  government 
both  administratively  and  financially.  Although  much  less  power- 
ful than  its  prewar  counterpart,  the  Home  Ministry,  the  postwar 
Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  and  other  national  ministries  as  well, 
have  the  authority  to  intervene  significandy  in  regional  and  local 
government.  The  result  of  this  power  is  a  high  level  of  organiza- 
tional and  policy  standardization  among  the  different  local  govern- 
ments. Because  local  tax  revenues  are  insufficient  to  support 
prefectural  and  city  governments,  these  bodies  depend  on  central 
government  for  subsidies.  The  term  "30  percent  autonomy"  is  fre- 
quently used  to  describe  local  government  because  that  amount 
of  revenues  is  derived  from  local  taxation.  Yet  local  governments 
are  not  entirely  passive.  People  have  a  strong  sense  of  local  com- 
munity, are  highly  suspicious  of  central  government,  and  wish  to 
preserve  the  uniqueness  of  their  prefecture,  city,  or  town.  Some 
of  the  more  progressive  jurisdictions,  such  as  Tokyo  and  Kyoto,

have  experimented  with  policies  in  such  areas  as  social  welfare  that 
later  were  adopted  by  the  national  government. 

The  Electoral  System 

The  Japanese  political  system  has  three  types  of  elections:  general 
elections  to  the  House  of  Representatives  held  every  four  years  (un- 
less the  lower  house  is  dissolved  earlier),  elections  to  the  House 
of  Councillors  held  every  three  years  to  choose  one-half  of  its  mem- 
bers, and  local  elections  held  every  four  years  for  offices  in  prefec- 
tures, cities,  and  villages.  Elections  are  supervised  by  election 
committees  at  each  administrative  level  under  the  general  direc- 
tion of  the  Central  Election  Administration  Committee.  The  mini- 
mum voting  age  for  persons  of  both  sexes  is  twenty  years;  voters 
must  satisfy  a  three-month  residency  requirement  before  being 


320 


The  Political  System 


allowed  to  cast  a  ballot.  For  those  seeking  office,  there  are  two  sets 
of  age  requirements:  twenty-five  years  of  age  for  admission  to  the 
House  of  Representatives  and  most  local  offices,  and  thirty  years 
of  age  for  admission  to  the  House  of  Councillors  and  the  prefec- 
tural  governorship. 

In  the  general  election  of  February  18,  1990,  the  thirty-ninth 
held  since  the  first  parliamentary  election  in  July  1890,  the  130 
multiple-seat  election  districts  of  the  House  of  Representatives 
returned  two  to  five  representatives,  depending  on  their  popula- 
tion. There  were  two  exceptions:  the  district  encompassing  the 
Amami  Islands,  south  of  Kyushu,  elected  only  one  representative 
to  the  lower  house,  while  the  first  district  of  Hokkaido  elected  six. 
Successful  candidates  were  those  who  won  at  least  the  fifth  largest 
aggregation  of  votes  in  a  five-person  district,  the  fourth  largest  in 
a  four-person  district,  and  so  on.  Voters  cast  their  ballots  for  only 
one  candidate.  Competition  for  lower  house  seats  in  the  February 
1990  general  election  varied  from  district  to  district.  Tokyo's  fourth 
district  had  seventeen  candidates  running  for  five  seats,  while  the 
second  district  in  Ibaraki  Prefecture  had  only  four  persons  run- 
ning for  three  seats.  In  Okinawa  Prefecture's  single  five- seat  dis- 
trict, there  were  only  six  candidates. 

In  House  of  Councillors  elections,  the  prefectural  constituencies 
elect  from  two  to  eight  councillors  depending  on  their  population. 
Each  voter  casts  one  ballot  for  a  prefectural  candidate  and  a  sec- 
ond one  for  a  party  in  the  national  constituency  system. 

Percentages  of  eligible  voters  casting  ballots  in  postwar  elections 
for  the  House  of  Representatives  have  varied  within  a  rather  nar- 
row range,  from  76.9  percent  in  May  1958  to  67.9  percent  in  De- 
cember 1983.  The  figure  for  the  February  18,  1990,  general  election 
was  72.4  percent.  Although  interest  in  politics  is  greater  in  urban 
than  rural  areas,  voter  turnout  in  the  latter  is  generally  higher, 
probably  because  constituents  have  a  greater  personal  stake  in  such 
elections. 

Elections  and  Political  Funding 

Partly  as  a  result  of  revelations  following  the  Recruit  scandal 
of  1988-89,  the  problem  of  political  funding  was  intensely  debated 
during  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s.  The  scandal  arose  through 
the  dealings  of  Ezoe  Hiromasa,  ambitious  chairman  of  the  board 
of  the  Recruit  Corporation  (a  professional  search  service  that  had 
diversified  into  finance  and  real  estate,  and  had  become  involved 
in  politics),  who  sold  large  blocks  of  untraded  shares  in  a  subsidi- 
ary, Recruit  Cosmos,  to  seventy-six  individuals.  When  the  stock 


321 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

was  traded  over  the  counter  in  1986,  its  price  jumped,  earning 
individual  investors  as  much  as  ¥100  million  (for  value  of  the 
yen — see  Glossary)  in  after-sales  profits.  The  persons  involved  in- 
cluded the  most  influential  leaders  of  the  LDP  (usually  through 
their  aides  or  spouses)  and  a  smaller  number  of  opposition  party 
figures.  Although  such  insider  trading  was  not  strictly  illegal,  it 
caused  public  outrage  at  a  time  when  the  ruling  party  was  con- 
sidering a  highly  controversial  consumption  tax.  Before  the  scan- 
dal ran  its  weary  course,  Takeshita  Noboru  was  obliged  to  resign 
as  prime  minister  in  April  1989,  a  senior  aide  committed  suicide 
in  expiation  for  his  leader's  humiliation,  and  former  Prime  Minister 
Nakasone  Yasuhiro  resigned  from  the  LDP — becoming  an  ''in- 
dependent" Diet  member — to  spare  the  much-tainted  party  fur- 
ther shame. 

Regarding  the  background  issue  of  political  funding,  a  group 
of  parliamentarians  belonging  to  the  ruling  LDP  estimated  in  1987 
that  annual  expenses  for  ten  newly  elected  members  of  the  Diet 
averaged  ¥120  million  each,  or  about  $US800,000  (see  table  34, 
Appendix).  This  figure,  which  included  expenses  for  staff  and  con- 
stituent services  in  a  member's  home  district,  was  less  than  the  aver- 
age for  Diet  members  as  a  whole,  because  long-term  incumbents 
tend  to  incur  higher  expenses.  Yet  in  the  late  1980s,  the  govern- 
ment provided  each  Diet  member  with  only  ¥20  million  for  an- 
nual operating  expenses,  leaving  ¥100  million  to  be  obtained 
through  private  contributions,  political  party  faction  bosses,  or  other 
means  (see  The  Liberal  Democratic  Party,  this  ch.).  The  lack  of 
public  funding  meant  that  politicians — especially,  but  not  exclu- 
sively, members  of  the  LDP — needed  constant  infusions  of  cash 
to  stay  in  office. 

Maintaining  staff  and  offices  in  Tokyo  and  the  home  district  con- 
stituted the  biggest  expense.  Near-obligatory  attendance  at  the  wed- 
dings and  funerals  of  constituents  and  their  families,  however,  was 
another  large  financial  drain:  the  Japanese  custom  requires  that 
attendees  contribute  cash,  handed  over  discreetly  in  elaborately 
decorated  envelopes,  to  the  parents  of  the  bride  and  groom  or  to 
the  bereaved. 

After  revelations  of  corrupt  activities  forced  the  resignation  of 
Prime  Minister  Tanaka  Kakuei,  postwar  Japan's  most  skillful  prac- 
titioner of  "money  politics,"  in  1974,  the  1948  Political  Funds  Con- 
trol Law  was  amended  to  establish  ceilings  for  contributions  from 
corporations,  other  organizations,  and  individuals.  This  change 
forced  Diet  members  to  seek  a  larger  number  of  smaller  contribu- 
tions to  maintain  cash  flow.  Fund-raising  parties  to  which  tickets 
were  sold  were  a  major  revenue  source  during  the  1980s,  and  the 


322 


The  Political  System 


abuse  of  these  ticket  sales  became  a  public  concern.  Another  re- 
lated problem  was  the  secrecy  surrounding  political  funds  and  their 
use.  Although  many  politicians,  including  members  of  newly  ap- 
pointed cabinets,  voluntarily  disclosed  their  personal  finances,  such 
disclosure  was  not  compulsory  in  the  early  1990s  and  many  sources 
of  revenue  remained  obscure. 

Proposals  for  system  reform  in  the  early  1990s  included  com- 
pulsory full  disclosure  of  campaign  funding,  more  generous  pub- 
lic allowances  for  Diet  members  to  reduce  (or,  ideally,  to  eliminate) 
their  reliance  on  under-the-table  contributions,  and  stricter  penalties 
for  violators,  including  lengthy  periods  of  being  barred  from  run- 
ning for  public  office.  Some  commentators  advocated  replacement 
of  the  lower  house's  multiple-seat  election  district  system  with  single- 
seat  constituencies  like  those  found  in  Britain  and  the  United  States. 
It  was  argued  that  the  multiple- seat  districts  made  election  cam- 
paigning more  expensive  because  party  members  from  the  same 
district  had  to  compete  among  themselves  for  the  votes  of  the  same 
constituents.  It  was  hoped  that  the  smaller  size  of  single-seat  districts 
would  also  reduce  the  expense  of  staff,  offices,  and  constituent  ser- 
vices. Critics  argued,  however,  that  the  creation  of  single- seat  con- 
stituencies would  virtually  eliminate  the  smaller  opposition  parties 
and  would  either  create  a  United  States-style  two-party  system  or 
give  the  LDP  an  even  greater  majority  in  the  lower  house  than 
it  enjoyed  under  the  multiple-seat  system. 

In  contrast  with  multimillion-dollar  United  States  political  cam- 
paigns, direct  expenses  for  the  comparatively  short  campaigns  before 
Japanese  general,  upper  house,  and  local  elections  were  relatively 
modest.  The  use  of  posters  and  pamphlets  was  strictly  regulated, 
and  candidates  appeared  on  the  noncommercial  public  television 
station,  NHK,  to  give  short  campaign  speeches.  Most  of  this  ac- 
tivity was  publicly  funded.  Campaign  sound-trucks  wove  their  way 
through  urban  and  rural  streets,  often  bombarding  residents  with 
earsplitting  harangues  from  candidates  or  their  supporters.  No  poli- 
tician, however,  could  expect  to  remain  in  office  without  considering 
expenses  for  constituent  services  the  most  important  component 
of  campaign  expenses. 

Electoral  Districts 

The  apportionment  of  electoral  districts  in  the  early  1990s  still 
reflected  the  distribution  of  the  population  in  the  years  following 
World  War  II,  when  only  one-third  of  the  people  lived  in  urban 
areas  and  two-thirds  lived  in  rural  areas.  In  the  next  forty- five  years, 
the  population  became  more  than  three-quarters  urban,  as  people 
deserted  rural  communities  to  seek  economic  opportunities  in  Tokyo 


323 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

and  other  large  cities  (see  Migration,  ch.  2).  The  lack  of  reappor- 
tionment led  to  a  serious  underrepresentation  of  urban  voters.  Urban 
districts  in  the  House  of  Representatives  were  increased  by  five  in 
1964,  bringing  nineteen  new  representatives  to  the  lower  house;  in 
1975,  six  more  urban  districts  were  established,  with  a  total  of  twenty 
new  representatives  allocated  to  them  and  to  other  urban  districts. 
Yet  great  inequities  remained  between  urban  and  rural  voters. 

In  the  early  1980s,  as  many  as  five  times  the  votes  were  needed 
to  elect  a  representative  from  an  urban  district,  as  compared  to 
a  rural  district.  Similar  disparities  existed  in  the  prefectural  con- 
stituencies of  the  House  of  Councillors.  The  Supreme  Court  had 
ruled  on  several  occasions  that  the  imbalance  violated  the  constitu- 
tional principle  of  one  person-one  vote.  The  Supreme  Court  man- 
dated the  addition  of  eight  representatives  to  urban  districts  and 
the  removal  of  seven  from  rural  districts  in  1986.  Several  lower 
house  districts'  boundaries  were  redrawn.  Yet  the  disparity  was 
still  as  much  as  three  urban  votes  to  one  rural  vote  in  the  early  1990s. 

After  the  1986  change,  the  average  number  of  total  persons  per 
lower  house  representative  was  236,424.  However,  the  figure  varied 
from  427,761  persons  per  representative  in  the  fourth  district  of 
Kanagawa  Prefecture,  which  contains  the  large  city  of  Yokohama, 
to  142,932  persons  in  the  third  district  of  largely  rural  and  moun- 
tainous Nagano  Prefecture.  A  major  reapportionment  seemed  un- 
likely in  the  near  future,  since  rural  voters  remained  a  major  source 
of  support  for  the  LDP  (see  Interest  Groups,  this  ch.). 

The  Judicial  System 

In  contrast  to  the  prewar  system,  in  which  executive  bodies  had 
much  control  over  the  courts,  the  postwar  Constitution  guaran- 
tees that  "all  judges  shall  be  independent  in  the  exercise  of  their 
conscience  and  shall  be  bound  only  by  this  Constitution  and  the 
Laws"  (Article  76).  They  cannot  be  removed  from  the  bench  "un- 
less judicially  declared  mentally  or  physically  incompetent  to  per- 
form official  duties"  and  they  cannot  be  disciplined  by  executive 
agencies  (Article  78).  A  Supreme  Court  justice,  however,  may  be 
removed  by  a  majority  of  voters  in  a  referendum  that  occurs  at 
the  first  general  election  following  the  justice's  appointment  and 
every  ten  years  thereafter.  As  of  the  early  1990s,  however,  the  elec- 
torate had  not  used  this  unusual  system  to  dismiss  a  justice. 

The  Supreme  Court,  the  highest  court,  is  the  final  court  of  ap- 
peal in  civil  and  criminal  cases.  The  Constitution's  Article  81  desig- 
nates it  "the  court  of  last  resort  with  power  to  determine  the 
constitutionality  of  any  law,  order,  regulation,  or  official  act."  The 
Supreme  Court  is  also  responsible  for  nominating  judges  to  lower 
courts,  determining  judicial  procedures,  overseeing  the  judicial

system  including  the  activities  of  public  prosecutors,  and  disciplining 
judges  and  other  judicial  personnel.  It  renders  decisions  from  either 
a  grand  bench  of  fifteen  justices  or  a  petty  bench  of  five.  The  grand 
bench  is  required  for  cases  involving  constitutionality.  The  court 
includes  twenty  research  clerks,  whose  function  is  similar  to  that 
of  the  clerks  of  the  United  States  Supreme  Court. 

The  judicial  system  is  unitary:  there  is  no  independent  system 
of  prefectural  level  courts  equivalent  to  the  state  courts  of  the  United 
States.  Below  the  Supreme  Court,  the  Japanese  system  included 
eight  high  courts,  fifty  district  courts,  and  fifty  family  courts  in  the 
late  1980s.  Four  of  each  of  the  last  two  types  of  courts  were  located 
in  Hokkaido,  and  one  of  each  in  the  remaining  forty- six  rural  prefec- 
tures, urban  prefectures,  and  the  Tokyo  Metropolitan  District. 
Summary  courts,  located  in  575  cities  and  towns  in  the  late  1980s, 
performed  the  functions  of  small  courts  and  justices  of  the  peace 
in  the  United  States,  having  jurisdiction  over  minor  offenses  and 
civil  cases. 

Judicial  Review 

The  Supreme  Court  was  generally  reluctant  to  exercise  the 
powers  of  judicial  review  given  to  it  by  the  Constitution,  in  large 


325 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

part  because  of  unwillingness  to  become  involved  in  politically  sen- 
sitive issues.  When  decisions  were  rendered  on  such  matters  as  the 
constitutionality  of  the  Self-Defense  Forces,  the  sponsorship  of 
Shinto  ceremonies  by  public  authorities,  or  the  Ministry  of  Edu- 
cation, Science,  and  Culture's  right  to  determine  the  content  of 
school  textbooks  or  teaching  curricula,  the  court  generally  took  a 
conservative,  progovernment  stance. 

In  the  words  of  political  scientist  T.J.  Pempel,  the  Supreme  Court 
4 'has  been  an  important,  if  frequently  unrecognized,  vehicle  for 
preserving  the  status  quo  in  Japan  and  for  reducing  the  capacity 
of  the  courts  to  reverse  executive  actions."  Important  exceptions 
to  this  conservative  trend,  however,  were  the  rulings  on  the  un- 
constitutionality of  the  electoral  district  apportionment  system,  dis- 
cussed above. 

The  Role  of  Law  in  Japanese  Society 

As  in  other  industrialized  countries,  law  plays  a  central  role  in 
Japanese  political,  social,  and  economic  life.  Fundamental  differ- 
ences between  Japanese  and  Western  legal  concepts,  however,  have 
often  led  Westerners  to  believe  that  Japanese  society  is  based  more 
on  quasi-feudalistic  principles  of  paternalism  (the  oyabun-kobun  rela- 
tionship) and  social  harmony,  or  wa,  (see  Values,  ch.  2).  Japan 
has  a  relatively  small  number  of  lawyers,  about  13,000  practicing 
in  the  mid-1980s  compared  with  667,000  in  the  United  States,  a 
country  with  only  twice  Japan's  population.  This  fact  has  been 
offered  as  evidence  that  the  Japanese  are  strongly  averse  to  upset- 
ting human  relationships  by  taking  grievances  to  court.  In  cases 
of  liability,  such  as  the  crash  of  a  Japan  Airlines  jetliner  in  August 
1985,  which  claimed  520  lives,  Japanese  victims  or  their  survivors 
were  more  willing  than  their  Western  counterparts  would  be  to  ac- 
cept the  ritualistic  condolences  of  company  presidents  (including 
officials'  resignations  over  the  incident)  and  nonjudicially  deter- 
mined compensation,  which  in  many  cases  was  less  than  they  might 
have  received  through  the  courts. 

Factors  other  than  a  cultural  preference  for  social  harmony, 
however,  explain  the  court-shy  behavior  of  the  Japanese.  The 
Ministry  of  Justice  closely  screened  university  law  faculty  gradu- 
ates and  others  who  wished  to  practice  law  or  serve  as  judges.  Only 
about  2  percent  of  the  approximately  25,000  persons  who  applied 
annually  to  the  Ministry's  Legal  Training  and  Research  Institute 
two-year  required  course  were  admitted  in  the  late  1980s.  The  in- 
stitute graduated  only  a  few  hundred  new  lawyers  each  year. 
Plagued  by  shortages  of  attorneys,  judges,  clerks,  and  other  per- 
sonnel, the  court  system  was  severely  overburdened.  Presiding

judges  often  strongly  advised  plaintiffs  to  seek  out-of-court  settle- 
ments. The  progress  of  cases  through  even  the  lower  courts  was 
agonizingly  slow,  and  appeals  carried  to  the  Supreme  Court  could 
take  decades.  Faced  with  such  obstacles,  most  individuals  chose 
not  to  seek  legal  remedies.  If  legal  personnel  were  dramatically  in- 
creased, which  seemed  unlikely  in  the  early  1990s,  use  of  the  courts 
might  approach  rates  found  in  the  United  States  and  other  Western 
countries. 

In  the  English-speaking  countries,  law  has  been  viewed  tradi- 
tionally as  a  framework  of  enforceable  rights  and  duties  designed 
to  protect  the  legitimate  interests  of  private  citizens.  The  judiciary 
is  viewed  as  occupying  a  neutral  stance  in  disputes  between  in- 
dividual citizens  and  the  state.  Legal  recourse  is  regarded  as  a  fun- 
damental civil  right.  The  reformers  of  the  Meiji  era  (1868-1912), 
however,  were  strongly  influenced  by  legal  theories  that  had  evolved 
in  Germany  and  other  continental  European  states.  The  Meiji 
reformers  viewed  the  law  primarily  as  an  instrument  through  which 
the  state  controls  a  restive  population  and  directs  energies  to  achiev- 
ing the  goals  of fukoku  kyohei  (wealth  and  arms). 

The  primary  embodiment  of  the  spirit  of  the  law  in  modern  Japan 
has  not  been  the  attorney  representing  private  interests  but  the 
bureaucrat  who  exercises  control  through  what  the  sociologist  Max 
Weber  has  called  "legal-rational"  methods  of  administration.  Com- 
petence in  law,  acquired  through  university  training,  consists  of 
implementing,  interpreting,  and,  at  the  highest  levels,  formulat- 
ing law  within  a  bureaucratic  framework.  Many  functions  per- 
formed by  lawyers  in  the  United  States  and  other  Western  countries 
are  the  responsibility  of  civil  servants  in  Japan.  The  majority  of 
the  country's  ruling  elite,  both  political  and  economic,  has  been 
recruited  from  among  the  graduates  of  the  Law  Faculty  of  the 
University  of  Tokyo  and  other  prestigious  institutions,  people  who 
have  rarely  served  as  private  attorneys. 

Legal-bureaucratic  controls  on  many  aspects  of  Japanese  soci- 
ety were  extremely  tight.  The  Ministry  of  Education,  Science,  and 
Culture,  for  example,  closely  supervised  both  public  and  private 
universities.  Changes  in  undergraduate  or  graduate  curricula,  the 
appointment  of  senior  faculty,  and  similar  actions  required  minis- 
try approval  in  conformity  with  very  detailed  regulations.  Although 
this  "control-oriented"  use  of  law  did  not  inhibit  the  freedom  of 
teaching  or  research  (protected  by  Article  23  of  the  Constitution), 
it  severely  limited  the  universities'  scope  for  reform  and  innova- 
tion. Controls  were  even  tighter  on  primary  and  secondary  schools 
(see  Education,  ch.  3).

Human  Rights 

Compared  to  most  of  its  Asian  neighbors  and  countries  in  most 
other  parts  of  the  world,  Japan's  record  on  human  rights  was  com- 
mendable, if  not  exemplary.  With  some  important  exceptions,  most 
observers  considered  informal  social  pressures  a  greater  factor  in 
limiting  individual  freedom  than  the  coercive  actions  of  the  author- 
ities. The  ancient  Japanese  adage  that  "the  nail  that  sticks  up  gets 
hammered  down"  captures  the  sense  that  Japanese  people  are 
pressured  more  to  conform  than  are  people  in  the  more  "individu- 
alistic" societies  of  the  West.  Some  Japanese  lower-  and  upper- 
secondary  schools,  for  example,  have  adopted  extremely  strict  dress 
codes,  determining  not  only  apparel  but  also  the  length  of  hair  to 
the  exact  centimeter.  Although  defended  by  conservative  educators 
as  a  way  of  cultivating  discipline  and  self-control,  these  codes  have 
been  widely  criticized  as  violations  of  students'  rights.  In  another 
example,  shopkeepers  and  local  community  groups  throughout 
Japan  canceled  sales  promotions  and  festivals  in  the  wake  of  Em- 
peror Hirohito's  illness  in  late  1988,  for  fear  of  being  labelled  un- 
patriotic. This  self-restraint  movement  cost  them  billions  of  yen. 

Although  freedom  of  expression  was,  for  the  most  part,  respected, 
certain  matters — particularly  those  relating  to  the  emperor — were 
widely  considered  taboo  subjects  for  public  figures.  Nagasaki  City 
mayor  Motoshima  Hitoshi,  a  member  of  the  LDP,  said  in  Decem- 
ber 1988  that  Hirohito  bore  some  responsibility  for  World  War 
II;  he  was  later  ostracized  by  influential,  mainstream  politicians, 
his  life  was  threatened  on  several  occasions,  and  in  January  1990, 
he  was  seriously  wounded  outside  his  office  by  a  right-wing  ex- 
tremist. Despite  the  affront  to  his  father,  Emperor  Akihito  visited 
Motoshima  after  the  attempt  on  his  life. 

Despite  Article  14's  guarantee  of  sexual  equality,  women  faced 
systematic  discrimination  in  the  workplace.  They  were  generally 
expected  to  quit  work  after  getting  married  or  having  children. 
However,  the  number  of  lifelong  career  women  grew  steadily  during 
the  1980s  and  early  1990s.  The  Diet's  passage  of  the  Law  for  Equal 
Opportunity  in  Employment  for  Men  and  Women  in  1985  was 
of  some  help  in  securing  women's  rights,  even  though  the  law  was 
a  "guideline"  and  entailed  no  legal  penalties  for  employers  who 
discriminated.  The  law  has,  however,  been  used  by  women  in  sev- 
eral court  cases  seeking  equal  treatment  in  such  areas  as  retire- 
ment age  (see  Gender  Stratification  and  the  Lives  of  Women,  ch.  2). 

Human  rights  had  also  become  an  issue  because  of  the  police 
practice  of  obtaining  confessions  from  criminal  suspects.  Although 
torture  was  rarely  used,  suspects  were  placed  under  tremendous 


328 


The  Political  System 


psychological  and  physical  pressures  to  confess.  In  several  cases, 
the  courts  acknowledged  that  confessions  were  forced  and  ordered 
prisoners  released  (see  The  Criminal  Justice  System,  ch.  8). 

The  greatest  controversy  concerning  human  rights,  however,  has 
focused  on  the  social  and  legal  treatment  of  minorities.  Although 
the  Japanese  considered  themselves  to  be  a  homogeneous  people, 
minorities  did  exist,  and  they  often  suffered  severe  discrimination. 
The  largest  group,  numbering  from  2  million  to  4  million  in  the 
1980s,  was  the  burakumin,  descendants  of  the  outcast  communi- 
ties of  feudal  Japan.  The  Ainu,  indigenous  inhabitants  of  north- 
ern Japan;  the  people  of  Okinawa;  and  ethnic  Koreans  also  have 
suffered  discrimination  (see  Minorities,  ch.  2). 

Contemporary  Political  Values 

Japanese  politics  are  generally  described  as  pragmatic,  limited 
by  particularistic  loyalties,  and  based  on  human  relations  rather 
than  ideology  or  principles.  The  quintessential  Japanese  leader  is 
a  network  builder  rather  than  the  embodiment  of  charisma  or  ideals; 
more  like  the  crafty  and  resourceful  founder  of  the  Tokugawa  bakufu, 
Tokugawa  Ieyasu,  than  the  ruthless  but  heroic  Oda  Nobunaga  (see 
Reunification,  1573-1600;  Tokugawa  Period,  1600-1867,  ch.  1). 
Such  political  dynamics  are  evident,  for  example,  in  the  workings 
of  the  LDP,  which  has  held  power  without  interruption  since  1955. 

Yet  the  pragmatic,  personalistic  view  of  politics  cannot  explain 
Japan's  militaristic  past,  the  political  crises  of  the  1960s,  the  con- 
troversies surrounding  the  emperor,  Article  9,  or  the  unwilling- 
ness of  many  in  the  Japan  Socialist  Party,  despite  a  huge  political 
cost,  to  abandon  their  antiwar  and  revolutionary  commitment  in 
the  early  1990s.  It  also  fails  to  account  for  the  apparently  sincerely 
held  ideological  beliefs  of  the  wartime  period.  The  "New  Order 
in  Greater  East  Asia' '  was  legitimized  on  the  basis  of  universal  prin- 
ciples, such  as  "pan-Asianism,"  "international  justice,"  and  "per- 
manent peace,"  even  if  the  results  were  quite  the  opposite  (see  The 
Rise  of  the  Militarists,  ch.  1).  The  nonideological  nature  of  main- 
stream Japanese  politics  in  the  postwar  period  reflects  defeat  in  war, 
the  failure  after  1945  to  find  a  national  ideological  consensus  to 
replace  discredited  wartime  beliefs,  and  the  commitment  of  both 
elite  and  ordinary  Japanese  to  expanding  the  economy  and  rais- 
ing living  standards.  As  these  goals  were  attained,  a  complacent, 
largely  apolitical  "middle  mass  society"  (a  term  coined  by  econo- 
mist Murakami  Yasusuke)  emerged,  in  which  90  percent  of  the 
people  in  opinion  polls  consistently  classified  themselves  as  "mid- 
dle class."

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Community  and  Leadership 

Certain  distinctive  features  of  Japanese  politics  can  be  iden- 
tified, although  this  is  not  to  say  that  they  are  unique  to  Japan. 
Rather,  qualities  also  found  in  other  political  systems,  such  as  the 
importance  of  personal  connections  and  consensus  building,  played 
an  extraordinarily  important  role  in  Japanese  politics.  These  fea- 
tures have  deep  historical  roots  and  reflect  values  that  pervade  the 
society  as  a  whole. 

In  both  feudal  and  modern  eras,  a  major  problem  for  Japanese 
political  leaders  has  been  reconciling  the  goals  of  community  sur- 
vival and  the  welfare  and  self-respect  of  individuals  in  an  environ- 
ment of  extreme  scarcity.  In  recent  centuries,  Japan  lacked  the 
natural  resources  and  space  to  accommodate  its  population  com- 
fortably. With  the  exception  of  Hokkaido  and  colonial  territories 
in  Asia  between  1895  and  1945,  there  was  no  "frontier"  to  ab- 
sorb excess  people.  One  solution  was  to  ignore  the  welfare  of  large 
sectors  of  the  population  (poor  peasants  and  workers)  and  to  use 
force  when  they  expressed  their  discontent.  Such  coercive  measures, 
common  during  both  the  Tokugawa  and  World  War  II  periods, 
largely,  although  not  entirely,  disappeared  in  the  postwar  "wel- 
fare state"  (for  example,  farmers  were  evicted  from  their  land  to 
construct  the  New  Tokyo  International  Airport  at  Narita-Sanrizuka 
in  the  1970s  after  long  negotiations  failed).  But  noncoercive,  or 
mostly  noncoercive,  methods  of  securing  popular  compliance  had 
developed  to  an  extraordinary  degree  in  social  and  political  life. 

The  most  important  such  method  is  the  promotion  of  a  strong 
sense  of  community  consciousness  and  group  solidarity.  Japanese 
individuals  are  often  characterized  as  having  a  strong  sense  of  self- 
sacrifice  and  community  dedication.  Historians  and  sociologists  note 
that  both  traditional  and  modern  Japanese  communities — the 
buraku,  the  feudal  domain  with  its  retinue  of  samurai,  the  large  com- 
mercial houses  found  in  Edo  (the  future  Tokyo),  Osaka,  and  Kyoto 
before  1868,  and  modern  corporations  and  bureaucracies  with  their 
cohorts  of  lifetime  employees — have  striven  to  be  all-inclusive.  Such 
groups  serve  a  variety  of  functions  for  the  individual,  providing 
not  only  income  and  sustenance  but  also  emotional  support  and 
individual  identity.  Japanese  called  such  community  inclusive- 
ness  the  "octopus-pot  way  of  life"  (takotsubo  seikatsu).  Large  pots 
with  narrow  openings  at  the  top  are  used  by  fishermen  to  capture 
octopuses,  and  the  term  is  used  to  refer  to  people  so  wrapped  up 
in  their  particular  social  group  that  they  cannot  see  the  world  out- 
side its  confines. 

The  "group  consciousness"  model  of  Japanese  social  life,  how- 
ever, has  been  overstressed  at  times.  A  person  may  often  go  along 


330

with  group  demands  because  they  serve  self-interest  in  the  long 
run  (for  example,  political  contributions  may  help  secure  future 
favors  from  those  in  office).  Historically,  democratic  concepts  of 
individual  rights  and  limited  government  have  been  deeply  appeal- 
ing because  they,  too,  promise  protection  of  individual  autonomy. 
Despite  very  different  ethical  and  political  traditions,  the  Japanese 
people  were  very  receptive  to  imported  liberal  ideas  both  before 
and  after  1945.  John  Stuart  Mill's  essay  On  Liberty,  for  example, 
was  extremely  popular  during  the  Meiji  era. 

Because  individual,  usually  passive,  resistance  to  group  demands 
occurred,  Japanese  leaders  have  found  the  creation  of  a  strong  com- 
munity sense  to  be  a  difficult  and  time-consuming  task.  Harmony 
(wa),  that  most  prized  social  value,  is  not  easily  attained.  One 
mechanism  for  achieving  wa  is  the  use  of  rituals  to  develop  a  psy- 
chological sense  of  group  identity.  Political  parties  and  factions, 
the  offices  of  national  and  local  governments,  businesses,  univer- 
sity departments,  research  groups,  alumni  associations,  and  other 
groups  sponsor  frequent  ceremonies  and  more  informal  parties 
for  this  purpose.  A  group's  history  and  identity  are  carefully  con- 
structed through  the  use  of  songs  and  symbols  (often  resembling, 
in  miniature,  the  Meiji  government's  creation  of  symbols  of  kokutai 
in  the  late  nineteenth  century).  Often,  an  organization's  founder, 


331 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

especially  if  deceased,  is  regarded  as  something  of  a  Confucian  sage 
or  a  Shinto  kami  (deity).  Group  members,  however,  may  find  that 
pervasive  ritualism  allows  them  to  "go  through  the  motions"  (such 
as  the  chanting  of  banzai  (ten  thousand  years)  at  the  end  of  politi- 
cal rallies,  without  having  to  make  a  deeper  commitment  to  the 
group. 

A  second  mechanism  to  promote  community  solidarity  is  the 
building  of  hierarchical  relationships.  In  this  practice,  the  influence 
of  premodern  ethics  is  readily  apparent.  In  what  the  anthropolo- 
gist Nakane  Chie  calls  Japan's  "vertical  society,"  human  relation- 
ships are  defined  in  terms  of  inequality,  and  people  relate  to  each 
other  as  superiors  and  inferiors  along  a  minutely  differentiated 
gradient  of  social  status,  not  only  within  bureaucratic  organiza- 
tions, where  it  might  be  expected,  but  also  in  academic,  artistic, 
and  especially,  political  worlds. 

Hierarchy  expresses  itself  along  two  dimensions:  first,  an  inter- 
nal community  differentiation  of  rank  by  seniority,  education,  and 
occupational  status;  and  second,  the  distinction  between  "insiders" 
and  "outsiders,"  between  members  and  nonmembers  of  the  com- 
munity, along  with  the  ranking  of  whole  groups  or  communities 
along  a  vertical  continuum.  Although  internal  hierarchy  can  cause 
alienation  as  inferiors  chafe  under  the  authority  of  their  superiors, 
the  external  kind  of  hierarchy  tends  to  strengthen  group  cohesion 
as  individual  members  work  to  improve  their  group's  relative  rank- 
ing. The  Japanese  nation  as  a  whole  has  been  viewed  as  a  single 
group  by  its  people  in  relation  to  other  nations.  Intense  national- 
ism has  frequently  been  a  manifestation  of  group  members'  desire 
to  "catch  up  and  overtake"  the  advanced  ("superior")  nations  of 
the  West,  while  the  rights  of  non-Western  nations,  like  China  or 
Korea,  often  viewed  as  "inferior,"  have  been  ignored. 

Like  group  consciousness,  however,  the  theme  of  hierarchy  has 
been  overstressed.  Contemporary  Japanese  politics  show  a  strong 
consciousness  of  equality,  and  even  traditional  communities,  such 
as  rural  villages,  were  often  egalitarian  rather  than  hierarchical. 
Citizens'  movements  of  the  1960s  and  1970s  differed  from  older 
political  organizations  in  their  commitment  to  promoting  intragroup 
democracy.  In  addressing  the  nation,  Emperor  Akihito  used  col- 
loquial Japanese  terms  that  stressed  equality,  rather  than  the  for- 
mal, hierarchy-laden  language  of  his  predecessors. 

Two  mechanisms  for  lessening  the  hierarchy- generated  tensions 
are  the  seniority  principle  and  early  retirement.  As  men  or  women 
grow  older,  gaining  seniority  within  an  organization,  they  acquire 
authority  and  higher  status.  The  seniority  principle  is  reinforced 
by  the  traditional  reluctance  to  place  younger  persons  in  positions 


332 


The  Political  System 


of  authority  over  older  ones.  The  institution  of  early  retirement 
(top-ranked  businesspeople  and  bureaucrats  commonly  retired  at 
age  fifty-five  or  sixty)  helps  to  the  keep  the  promotion  of  others 
smooth  and  predictable.  The  system  also  helps  to  enable  talented 
individuals  to  succeed  to  the  most  responsible  positions  and  pre- 
vents a  small  group  of  older  persons  (what  the  Japanese  call  "one- 
man  leaders")  from  monopolizing  leadership  positions  and  impos- 
ing increasingly  outmoded  ideas  on  the  organization.  Elite  retirees, 
however,  often  continue  to  wield  influence  as  advisers  and  usually 
pursue  second  careers  in  organizations  affiliated  with  the  one  from 
which  they  retired. 

The  circulation  of  elites  that  results  from  the  seniority  and  early 
retirement  principles  ensures  that  everyone  within  the  upper  ranks 
of  the  hierarchy  has  a  turn  at  occupying  a  high- status  position,  such 
as  a  cabinet  post  in  the  national  government.  This  principle,  in 
turn,  enables  people  to  reward  their  followers.  There  has  been,  for 
example,  a  regular  turnover  of  LDP  leaders.  No  individual  has 
served  as  party  president  (and  prime  minister)  longer  than  Sato 
Eisaku,  the  incumbent  between  1964  and  1972.  The  average  ten- 
ure of  party  presidents/prime  ministers  between  1964  and  1987  was 
slightly  more  than  three  years.  Frequent  cabinet  reshuffling  meant 
that  the  average  tenure  of  other  cabinet  ministers  in  the  same  period 
was  a  little  less  than  a  year.  Japan  has  not  been  beset  with  leaders 
in  their  seventies  and  eighties  unwilling  to  give  up  their  powerful 
positions. 

Another  mechanism  reducing  intragroup  tensions  is  the  strong 
personal,  rather  than  legalistic  or  ideological,  ties  between  supe- 
rior and  subordinate.  These  ties  are  typically  characterized  in  terms 
of  fictive  familial  relationships,  analogous  to  the  bonds  between 
parents  and  children  (the  oyabun-kobun  relationship).  The  ideal  leader 
is  viewed  as  a  paternalistic  one,  with  a  warm  and  personal  con- 
cern for  the  welfare  of  his  followers.  For  followers,  loyalty  is  both 
morally  prescribed  and  emotionally  sustained  by  the  system.  In 
the  political  world,  oyabun-kobun  relationships  are  pervasive  despite 
the  formal  commitment  to  universalistic,  democratic  values.  At  the 
same  time,  younger  people  find  such  relationships  less  appealing 
than  their  elders.  The  so-called  shinjinrui  (new  human  beings),  born 
in  the  affluent  1960s  and  1970s,  were  often  criticized  by  older 
Japanese  for  being  self-absorbed,  egoistic,  and  "cool,"  in  the  1980s. 
The  younger  generation  is  inclined  to  view  with  disdain  the  emo- 
tional expression  of  paternalistic  ties,  such  as  in  the  1989  televi- 
sion broadcasts  of  former  Prime  Minister  Tanaka  Kakuei's 
supporters  weeping  profusely  over  his  political  retirement.

Consensus  Building 

The  community  is  often  demanding,  but  it  is  also  fragile,  be- 
cause social  ties  are  sustained  not  only  through  legal  norms  and 
common  self-interest,  but  also  through  the  affective  patron-client 
relationship.  Open  conflict  poses  a  danger  to  the  survival  of  this 
sort  of  community,  and  thus  policy  making  requires  elaborate  con- 
sultation and  consensus  building,  usually  involving  all  the  parties 
concerned.  According  to  political  scientist  Lewis  Austin,  "Every- 
one must  be  consulted  informally,  everyone  must  be  heard,  but 
not  in  such  a  way  that  the  hearing  of  different  opinions  develops 
into  opposition.  The  leader  and  his  assistants  'harmonize  opin- 
ion'. .  .  in  advance,  using  go-betweens  to  avert  the  confrontation 
of  opposing  forces. ' '  After  a  preliminary  agreement  among  all  has 
been  reached,  a  formal  meeting  is  held  in  which  the  agreed-upon 
policy  will  be  proposed  and  adopted. 

This  process  is  called  nemawashi  (root  trimming  or  binding),  evok- 
ing the  image  of  a  gardener  preparing  a  tree  or  shrub  for  trans- 
planting, that  is,  a  change  in  policy.  Austin  points  out  that  a 
common  Japanese  verb  meaning  "to  decide"  (matomeru)  literally 
means  to  gather  or  bring  together.  Decisions  are  "the  sum  of  the 
contributions  of  all."  Although  consensus  building  is,  for  leaders, 
a  time-consuming  and  emotionally  exhausting  process,  it  is  nec- 
essary not  only  to  promote  group  goals  but  also  to  respect  and 
protect  individual  autonomy.  In  fact,  the  process  represents  recon- 
ciliation of  the  two.  In  the  political  system  as  a  whole,  most  groups 
played  some  role  in  the  nemawashi  process  in  the  early  1990s.  Ex- 
ceptions were  those  groups  or  individuals,  such  as  Koreans  or 
burakumin,  who  were  viewed  as  outsiders. 

Political  leaders  have  to  maintain  solidarity  and  harmony  within 
a  single  group  and  also  secure  the  cooperation  of  different  groups 
who  are  often  in  bitter  conflict.  Takotsubo  seikatsu  can  promote  de- 
structive sectionalism.  During  World  War  II,  rivalry  between  the 
Imperial  Army  and  the  Imperial  Navy  was  so  intense  that  it  was 
nearly  impossible  to  coordinate  their  strategic  operations.  In  the 
postwar  political  system,  prime  ministers  have  often  been  unable 
to  persuade  different  ministries,  all  self-sufficient  and  intensely 
jealous  "kingdoms,"  to  go  along  with  reforms  in  such  areas  as  trade 
liberalization.  Observers  such  as  journalist  Karel  G.  van  Wolferen, 
have  concluded  that  Japan's  political  system  is  empty  at  the  center, 
lacking  real  leadership  or  a  locus  of  responsibility:  "Statecraft  in 
Japan  is  quite  different  from  that  in  the  rest  of  Asia,  Europe,  and 
the  Americas.  For  centuries  it  has  entailed  the  preservation  of  a 
careful  balance  of  semiautonomous  groups  that  share  power.  .  .  .

The  Political  System 


These  semiautonomous  components,  each  endowed  with  great  dis- 
cretionary powers,  are  not  represented  in  one  central  ruling  body." 
This  view  is  probably  exaggerated.  Leadership  in  other  countries, 
including  the  United  States,  has  been  paralyzed  from  time  to  time 
by  powerful  interest  groups  and  some  policies  in  Japan  requiring 
decisive  leadership,  such  as  the  creation  of  social  welfare  and  energy 
conservation  policies  in  the  1970s  and  the  privatization  of  state 
enterprises  in  the  1980s,  have  been  reasonably  successful. 

Interest  Groups 

The  emphasis  on  consensus  in  Japanese  politics  is  seen  in  the 
role  of  interest  groups  in  policy  making.  In  the  early  1990s,  these 
groups  ranged  from  those  with  economic  interests,  such  as  occupa- 
tional and  professional  associations,  to  those  with  strong  ideologi- 
cal commitments,  such  as  the  right-wing  Society  to  Protect  Japan 
and  the  left-wing  Japan  Teachers  Union  (Nihon  Kyoshokuin 
Kumiai — Nikkyoso).  There  were  groups  representing  minorities 
(the  Burakumin  Liberation  League,  the  Central  Association  of 
Korean  Residents  in  Japan  [Chosoren],  and  Utari  Kyokai  in 
Hokkaido,  representing  the  Ainu  community),  groups  represent- 
ing war  veterans  and  postwar  repatriates  from  Japan's  overseas 
colonies  (the  Military  Pensions  Association  and  the  Association  of 
Repatriates),  the  victims  of  the  atomic  bombings  of  Hiroshima  and 
Nagasaki,  and  women  opposed  to  prostitution  and  the  threat  to 
public  morals  posed  by  businesses  offering  "adult"  entertainment 
(the  Japan  Mothers  League).  Mayors'  and  prefectural  governors' 
associations  promoted  regional  development.  Residents'  movements 
near  United  States  military  installations  in  Okinawa  and  elsewhere 
pressured  local  authorities  to  support  reductions  in  base  areas  and 
to  exert  more  control  over  United  States  military  personnel  off  base. 
The  great  majority  of  Japanese  were  connected,  either  directly  or 
indirectly,  to  one  or  more  of  these  bodies. 

In  the  postwar  period,  extremely  close  ties  emerged  among  major 
interest  groups,  political  parties,  and  the  bureaucracy.  Many  groups 
identified  so  closely  with  the  ruling  LDP  that  it  was  often  difficult 
to  discern  the  borders  between  party  and  group  membership. 
Officers  of  agricultural,  business,  and  professional  groups  were 
elected  to  the  Diet  as  LDP  legislators.  Groups  of  LDP  parliamen- 
tarians formed  zoku  (tribes),  which  represented  the  interests  of 
occupational  constituencies,  such  as  farmers,  small  businesses,  and 
the  construction  industry.  The  zoku,  interest  groups,  and  bureau- 
crats worked  together  closely  in  formulating  policy  in  such  areas 
as  agriculture  (see  Bureaucrats  and  the  Policy-making  Process,  this 
ch.).

Japan:  A  Country  Study 


In  the  case  of  the  Japan  Socialist  Party,  Democratic  Socialist 
Party,  Japan  Communist  Party  (Nihon  Kyosanto),  and  Komeito 
(Clean  Government  Party),  the  links  with  interest  groups  were  even 
more  intimate.  Before  the  Japanese  Trade  Union  Confederation 
(Shin  Rengo)  was  established  in  1989,  most  leaders  of  the  Japan 
Socialist  Party  and  Democratic  Socialist  Party  and  many  socialist 
Diet  members  had  been  officers  of  the  confederation's  predeces- 
sors, the  General  Council  of  Trade  Unions  of  Japan  (Nihon  Rodo 
Kumiai  Sohyogikai,  or  Sohyo  for  short)  founded  in  1950,  and  the 
Japan  Confederation  of  Labor  (Zen  Nihon  Rodo  Sodomei,  or 
Domei  for  short),  established  in  1964.  Despite  repeated  disavowals, 
the  Komeito  remained,  in  the  early  1990s,  related  to  its  parent  body, 
the  Soka  Gakkai  (Value  Creation  Society),  an  organization  of  lay 
followers  of  the  Buddhist  sect,  Nichiren  Shoshu,  founded  before 
World  War  II  and  one  of  Japan's  most  successful  new  religions 
(see  Komeito,  this  ch.;  Religious  and  Philosophical  Traditions, 
ch.  2).  The  communists  had  their  own  unions  and  small  business 
groups,  which  competed  with  conservative  small  business  associa- 
tions. Japan's  relatively  few  lawyers  divided  their  allegiance  among 
three  professional  groups  separately  affiliated  with  the  LDP,  the 
Japan  Socialist  Party,  and  the  Japan  Communist  Party. 

Both  the  LDP  and  the  opposition  parties,  which  had  weak  re- 
gional organizations,  depended  on  the  interest  groups  to  win  elec- 
tions. The  interest  groups  provided  funding,  blocks  of  loyal  voters 
(although  these  could  not  be  manipulated  as  easily  as  in  the  past), 
and  local  organizational  networks. 

One  important  question  concerning  interest  groups  in  any  coun- 
try is  how  well  they  represent  the  diverse  concerns  of  all  the  citizens. 
A  second  is  whether  government  responds  evenhandedly  to  their 
demands.  Japan's  postwar  record  on  both  counts  was  generally 
good.  Both  major  and  minor  groups  in  society  were  well  repre- 
sented. And  the  government  has  implemented  policies  to  spread 
the  blessings  of  economic  growth  among  the  population  at  large. 
Such  arrangements  helped  to  ensure  political  stability,  and  to  ex- 
plain why,  in  repeated  public  opinion  polls,  90  percent  of  respon- 
dents viewed  themselves  as  "middle  class." 

After  the  war,  for  example,  there  were  major  policy  changes  on 
agriculture.  Despite  prewar  nationalistic  idealization  of  the  rural 
village,  the  government  at  that  time  squeezed  the  farmers  for  taxes 
and  rice.  Political  scientist  Kent  C alder  observed  that  "the  prewar 
state  took  heavily  from  the  countryside,  without  providing  much 
in  return."  Historians  describe  how  many  farm  families  starved, 
or  were  forced  to  sell  their  daughters  into  prostitution.  Respond- 
ing to  the  threat  of  vigorous  leftist  movements  in  the  countryside, 


336 


The  Political  System 


conservative  governments  after  1945  initiated  price  supports  for 
rice  and  other  measures  that  brought  the  farmers  not  just  a  decent 
standard  of  living  but  affluence.  By  the  1970s,  it  was  not  uncom- 
mon to  encounter  group  tours  of  farmers  who  had  never  visited 
Tokyo  taking  holidays  in  Hawaii  or  New  York  City.  In  Calder's 
view,  conservative  governments  were  stoutly  probusiness  but  were 
also  willing  to  coopt  other  interests  such  as  agriculture  at  the  ex- 
pense of  business  to  ensure  social  stability  and  prevent  socialist  elec- 
toral victories.  Sometimes  government  adopted  policies  first 
espoused  by  the  opposition  (for  example,  medical  insurance  and 
other  social  welfare  policies). 

Business  Interests 

Links  between  the  corporate  world  and  government  were  main- 
tained through  three  national  organizations:  the  Federation  of  Eco- 
nomic Organizations  (Keizai  Dantai  Rengokai — Keidanren), 
established  in  1946;  the  Japan  Committee  for  Economic  Devel- 
opment (Keizai  Doyu  Kai),  established  in  1946;  and  the  Japan 
Federation  of  Employers  Association  (Nihon  Keieishadantai 
Renmei — Nikkeiren),  established  in  1948.  In  the  early  1990s, 
Keidanren  was  considered  the  most  important.  Its  membership  in- 
cluded 750  of  the  largest  corporations  and  110  manufacturers  as- 
sociations. Its  Tokyo  headquarters  served  as  a  kind  of  "nerve 
center"  for  the  country's  most  important  enterprises,  and  it  worked 
closely  with  the  powerful  Ministry  of  International  Trade  and  In- 
dustry (MITI).  There  was  evidence,  however,  suggesting  that  the 
federation's  power  in  the  1990s  was  not  what  it  had  been,  partly 
because  major  corporations,  which  had  amassed  huge  amounts  of 
money  by  the  late  1980s,  were  increasingly  capable  of  operating 
without  its  assistance. 

Nikkeiren  was  concerned  largely  with  labor-management  rela- 
tions and  with  organizing  a  united  business  front  to  negotiate  with 
labor  unions  on  wage  demands  during  the  annual  "Spring  Strug- 
gle." The  Keizai  Doyu  Kai,  composed  of  younger  and  more  liberal 
business  leaders,  assigned  itself  the  role  of  promoting  business' s 
social  responsibilities.  Whereas  Keidanren  and  Nikkeiren  were 
"peak  organizations,"  whose  members  themselves  were  associa- 
tions, members  of  the  Keizai  Doyu  Kai,  were  individual  business 
leaders  (see  Labor  Unions,  ch.  4). 

Because  of  financial  support  from  companies,  business  interest 
groups  were  generally  more  independent  of  political  parties  than 
other  groups.  Both  Keidanren  and  the  Keizai  Doyu  Kai,  for  ex- 
ample, indicated  a  willingness  to  talk  with  the  socialists  in  the  wake 
of  the  political  scandals  of  1 988-89  and  also  suggested  that  the  LDP 


337 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

might  form  a  coalition  government  with  an  opposition  party.  Yet 
through  an  organization  called  the  People's  Politics  Association 
(Kokumin  Seiji  Kyokai),  they  and  other  top  business  groups  pro- 
vided the  LDP  with  its  largest  source  of  party  funding. 

Small  Business 

Japan's  streets  are  lined  with  small  shops,  grocery  stores,  restau- 
rants, and  coffeehouses.  Although  supermarkets  and  large  discount 
department  stores  were  more  common  in  the  early  1990s  than  a 
decade  earlier,  the  political  muscle  of  small  business  associations 
was  reflected  in  the  success  with  which  they  blocked  the  rationali- 
zation of  the  country's  distribution  system.  The  Large-Scale  Re- 
tail Store  Law  of  1973,  amended  in  1978,  made  it  very  difficult 
in  the  late  1980s  for  either  Japanese  or  foreign  retailers  to  estab- 
lish large,  economically  efficient  outlets  in  local  communities. 

Many  light  industrial  goods,  such  as  toys,  footwear,  pencils,  and 
kitchen  utensils,  were  still  manufactured  by  small  local  companies 
rather  than  imported  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea), 
Taiwan,  or  Hong  Kong.  Traditional  handicrafts,  such  as  pottery, 
silk  weaving,  and  lacquerware,  produced  using  centuries-old 
methods  in  small  workshops,  flourished  in  every  part  of  the  coun- 
try. Apart  from  protectionism  of  the  "nontariff  barrier"  variety, 
the  government  assured  the  economic  viability  of  small  enterprises 
through  lenient  tax  policies  and  access  to  credit  on  especially  favora- 
ble terms. 

Major  associations  representing  small  and  medium-sized  enter- 
prises included  the  generally  pro-LDP  Japan  Chamber  of  Com- 
merce and  Industry  (Nihon  Shoko  Kaigisho,  or  Nissho  for  short), 
which  was  established  in  1922  but  whose  origins  are  traced  to  the 
establishment  of  the  Tokyo  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry 
in  1878,  the  National  Central  Association  of  Medium  and  Small 
Enterprise  Associations,  the  Japan  League  of  Medium  and  Small 
Enterprise  Organizations,  and  the  Japan  Communist  Party- 
sponsored  Democratic  Merchants  and  Manufacturers  Association. 

Although  small  enterprises  in  services  and  manufacturing 
preserved  cultural  traditions  and  enlivened  urban  areas,  a  major 
motivation  for  government  nurture  of  small  business  was  social  wel- 
fare. In  Kent  Calder's  words,  "Much  of  small  business,  particu- 
larly in  the  distribution  sector,  serves  as  a  labor  reservoir.  Its 
inefficiencies  help  absorb  surplus  workers  who  would  be  unem- 
ployed if  distribution,  services,  and  traditional  manufacturing  were 
uniformly  as  efficient  as  the  highly  competitive  and  modernized 
export  sectors." 


338 


The  Political  System 


Agricultural  Cooperatives 

Observers  have  suggested  that  the  great  influence  of  the  Cen- 
tral Union  of  Agricultural  Cooperatives  (Nokyo)  in  policy  making 
partly  resulted  from  a  widespread  feeling  of  gratitude  to  the  dwin- 
dling agricultural  sector,  which  in  the  past  supported  the  country's 
industrial  modernization.  Nokyo  spokespersons  were  vociferous  in 
their  claims  that  agriculture  is  somehow  intimately  connected  with 
the  spirit  of  the  nation.  They  argued  that  self-sufficiency,  or  near 
self-sufficiency,  in  food  production,  resulting  from  government  sup- 
port of  the  nation's  farmers,  was  central  to  Japan's  security.  The 
public  in  general  was  receptive  to  their  arguments:  an  opinion  poll 
in  1988,  for  example,  revealed  that  70  percent  of  respondents 
preferred  paying  a  higher  price  for  rice  to  importing  it. 

Nokyo,  organized  in  1947  at  the  time  of  the  land  reform,  had 
local  branches  in  every  rural  village  in  the  late  1980s.  Its  constit- 
uent local  agricultural  cooperatives  included  practically  all  of  the 
population  for  which  farming  was  the  principal  occupation.  Since 
its  founding,  Nokyo  had  been  preoccupied  with  maintaining  and 
increasing  government  price  supports  on  rice  and  other  crops  and 
with  holding  back  the  import  of  cheaper  agricultural  products  from 
abroad.  Self-sufficient  in  rice,  Japan  in  the  late  1980s  imported 
only  a  tiny  quantity.  A  special  variety  of  Thai  rice,  for  example, 
is  used  specifically  to  make  the  traditional  Okinawan  liquor, 
awamori.  Nokyo's  determination  to  preserve  "Fortress  Japan"  in 
the  agricultural  realm  had  brought  it  into  conflict  with  business 
groups  such  as  Keidanren,  which  advocated  market  liberalization 
and  cheaper  food  prices. 

Although  closely  allied  to  the  LDP  in  the  past,  Nokyo  and  other 
agricultural  groups  were  outraged  by  the  government's  concessions 
to  the  United  States  on  imports  of  oranges  and  beef  in  1988.  Local 
cooperatives  threatened  to  defect  to  the  Japan  Socialist  Party  if 
government  continued  to  give  in  to  American  demands.  The  Japan 
Socialist  Party  chairwoman,  Doi  Takako,  made  agricultural  pro- 
tectionism a  major  component  of  her  party's  platform. 

Labor  Organizations 

Postwar  labor  unions  were  established  with  the  blessings  of  the 
occupation  authorities.  The  mechanism  for  collective  bargaining 
was  set  up,  and  unions  were  organized  by  enterprise:  membership 
was  determined  by  company  affiliation  rather  than  by  skill  or  in- 
dustry type.  In  general,  membership  was  also  limited  to  perma- 
nent, nonsupervisory  personnel.  Observers  in  the  late  1980s  viewed 
labor  unions'  role  in  the  policy-making  process  as  less  powerful 


339 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


than  that  of  business  and  agricultural  organizations  because  the 
unions'  enterprise-based  structure  made  national  federations  weak 
and  unions  were  closely  associated  with  parties  that  remained  out 
of  power. 

The  Japan  Socialist  Party  largely  depended  on  Sohyo  for  fund- 
ing, organizational  support,  and  membership  during  most  of  the 
postwar  period.  Domei  performed  similar  functions  for  the  Dem- 
ocratic Socialist  Party.  Sohyo  was  composed  primarily  of  public 
sector  unions  such  as  those  organized  for  national  civil  servants, 
municipal  workers,  and  public  school  teachers.  Domei 's  constituent 
unions  were  principally  in  the  private  sector.  In  the  late  1980s, 
however,  the  labor  movement  saw  significant  change.  In  Novem- 
ber 1987,  the  National  Federation  of  Private  Sector  Trade  Unions 
(Rengo),  an  amalgamation  of  Domei  and  smaller  groups,  was 
formed  with  a  membership  of  5.5  million  workers.  After  two  years 
of  intense  negotiations,  it  joined  with  2 . 5  million  members  of  public 
sector  unions  largely  affiliated  with  Sohyo  to  establish  a  new  en- 
tity, Shin  Rengo.  With  8  million  members,  Shin  Rengo  included 
65  percent  of  Japan's  unionized  workers  and  was,  after  the  Ameri- 
can Federation  of  Labor-Congress  of  Industrial  Organizations 
(AFL-CIO)  and  the  British  Trades  Union  Congress,  the  world's 
third  largest  noncommunist  union  federation. 

Shin  Rengo  was  a  moderate,  nonideological  movement  that 
shunned  involvement  with  Marxist  Japan  Communist  Party- 
affiliated  unions.  Two  leftist  union  confederations  emerged  in  the 
wake  of  Shin  Rengo:  the  1.2 -million-member  Japan  Confedera- 
tion of  Trade  Unions  (Zenroren),  and  the  500,000-member  Na- 
tional Trade  Union  Council  (Zenrokyo).  The  powerful  Nikkyoso, 
with  675,000  members  in  the  country's  public  primary  and  second- 
ary schools,  was  divided  between  adherents  and  opponents  of  Shin 
Rengo. 

In  the  early  1990s,  the  relationship  of  Shin  Rengo  to  the  socialist 
political  parties  remained  somewhat  unclear.  It  was  likely  that  many 
old  support  networks  would  remain  in  place.  Some  noted  the  new 
confederation's  potential  for  promoting  opposition  party  unity  be- 
cause it  encompassed  supporters  of  the  two  socialist  parties  and 
the  small  Social  Democratic  League.  In  the  House  of  Councillors 
election  on  July  23,  1989,  the  three  parties  agreed  to  support  twelve 
Shin  Rengo  candidates.  Eleven  of  them  won. 

Professional  Associations  and  Citizen  and  Consumer  Movements 

Physicians,  dentists,  lawyers,  academics,  and  other  profession- 
als organized  associations  for  the  exchange  of  knowledge,  supervi- 
sion of  professional  activities,  and  influence  of  government  policy, 


340 


The  Political  System 


like  those  found  in  other  developed  countries.  The  Japan  Medical 
Association  has  used  its  influence  to  preserve  a  highly  profitable 
system  in  which  physicians,  rather  than  pharmacists,  sell  prescrip- 
tion drugs. 

Citizens  and  consumer  movements,  which  became  prominent 
during  the  1960s  and  1970s,  were  organized  around  issues  relat- 
ing to  the  quality  of  life,  the  protection  of  the  environment  from 
industrial  pollution,  and  the  safety  (although  not  the  cost)  of  con- 
sumer goods.  In  the  late  1960s,  industrial  pollution,  symbolized 
by  the  suffering  of  victims  of  mercury  poisoning  caused  by  the  pol- 
lution of  Minamata  Bay  in  Kumamoto  Prefecture  by  a  chemical 
company,  was  viewed  as  a  national  crisis.  The  Sato  government 
responded  by  establishing  the  Environmental  Agency  in  the  Office 
of  the  Prime  Minister  in  1970,  instituting  tough  penalties  for  pol- 
luters, and  extending  compensation  to  the  victims  of  pollution.  In 
the  early  1990s,  environmental  issues  continued  to  be  the  focus  of 
intense  local  activity.  Communities  on  Ishigaki  Island  in  Okinawa 
Prefecture  were  divided  over  whether  to  construct  a  new  airport 
to  handle  wide-bodied  aircraft  on  land  reclaimed  from  the  sea.  Sup- 
porters viewed  the  project  as  essential  to  the  island's  tourist  de- 
velopment, while  opponents  claimed  that  construction  would 
destroy  offshore  colonies  of  rare  blue  coral  and  would  ruin  the  local 
fishing  industry.  Another  environmental  issue  in  many  parts  of 
Japan  was  the  use  of  powerful  chemicals  on  golf  courses,  which 
in  some  cases  harmed  nearby  residents  (see  Pollution,  ch.  2). 

Women's  groups  were  in  the  forefront  of  the  consumer  move- 
ment. In  the  early  1990s,  they  included  the  National  Federation 
of  Regional  Women's  Associations,  the  Housewives  Association, 
and  the  National  Association  of  Consumer  Cooperatives.  Their 
activities  depended  on  the  support  of  neighborhood  women's  as- 
sociations, the  women's  sections  of  local  agricultural  and  fishing 
cooperatives,  and  government- sponsored  consumer  education 
groups.  Although  boycotts  had  been  organized  against  companies 
making  products  that  the  groups  viewed  as  dangerous  (for  exam- 
ple, canned  foods  containing  carcinogenic  cyclamates),  they  did 
not,  for  the  most  part,  demand  lower  prices  for  food  or  other  goods. 
In  tandem  with  agricultural  interests,  consumer  groups  opposed 
increased  food  imports  on  the  grounds  that  supply  was  unpredic- 
table and  that  they  were  laced  with  dangerous  additives. 

The  Mass  Media  and  Politics 

Japan  is  a  society  awash  in  information.  In  the  early  1990s, 
newspaper  readership  was,  by  a  wide  margin,  the  highest  in  the 
world.  The  six  largest  and  most  influential  newspapers  were  Yomiuri 


341 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


Shimbun,  Mainichi  Shimbun,  Asahi  Shimbun,  Seikyo  Shimbun,  Sankei 
Shimbun,  and  Nihon  Keizai  Shimbun.  There  were  also  more  than  100 
local  newspapers.  The  population,  almost  100  percent  literate,  also 
consumed  record  numbers  of  books  and  magazines.  The  latter 
ranged  from  high-quality  comprehensive  general  circulation  intellec- 
tual periodicals  such  as  Sekai  (World),  Chuo  Koron  (Central  Review), 
and  Bungei  Shunju  (Literary  Annals)  to  sarariman  manga  (salaryman 
comics),  comic  books  for  adults  that  depict  the  vicissitudes  and  fan- 
tasies of  contemporary  office  workers,  and  weeklies  specializing 
in  scandals.  Japan  probably  also  led  the  world  in  the  translation 
of  works  by  foreign  scholars  and  novelists.  Most  of  the  classics  of 
Western  political  thought,  such  as  The  Republic  by  Plato  and 
Leviathan  by  Thomas  Hobbes,  for  example,  were  available  in 
Japanese. 

News  programs  and  special  features  on  television,  moreover,  gave 
viewers  detailed  reports  on  political,  economic,  and  social  develop- 
ments both  at  home  and  abroad.  The  sole  noncommercial  public 
radio  and  television  broadcasting  network,  the  Japan  Broadcast- 
ing Corporation  (Nippon  Hoso  Kyokai — NHK)  provided  gener- 
ally balanced  coverage.  Unlike  their  counterparts  in  the  United 
States,  however,  Japanese  newscasters  on  NHK  and  commercial 
stations  usually  confined  themselves  to  relating  events  and  did  not 
offer  opinions  or  analysis. 

The  major  magazines  and  newspapers  were  vocal  critics  of 
government  policies  and  took  great  pains  to  map  out  the  person- 
nel and  financial  ties  that  held  the  conservative  establishment 
together.  Readers  were  regularly  informed  of  matrimonial  alliances 
between  families  of  top  politicians,  civil  servants,  and  business  lead- 
ers, which  in  some  ways  resembled  those  of  the  old  European 
aristocracy.  The  important  print  media  were  privately  owned. 

Observers  in  the  early  1990s,  however,  pointed  out  that  the  in- 
dependence of  the  established  press  had  been  compromised  by  the 
pervasive  "press  club"  system.  Politicians  and  government  agen- 
cies each  had  one  of  these  clubs,  which  contained  from  12  to  almost 
300  reporters  from  the  different  newspapers,  magazines,  and  broad- 
cast media.  Club  members  were  generally  described  as  being  closer 
to  each  other  than  they  were  to  their  employers.  They  also  estab- 
lished a  close  and  collaborative  working  relationship  with  the  po- 
litical figures  or  government  agencies  to  which  they  were  attached. 
There  was  little  opportunity  for  reporters  to  establish  a  genuinely 
critical,  independent  stance  because  reporting  distasteful  matters 
might  lead  to  exclusion  from  the  club  and  thus  inability  to  gain 
information  and  write.  Although  the  media  has  played  a  major  role 
in  exposing  political  scandals,  some  critics  have  accused  the  large

newspapers,  ostensibly  oppositionist,  of  being  little  more  than  a 
conduit  of  government  ideas  to  the  people.  Free-lance  reporters, 
working  outside  the  press  club  system,  often  made  the  real  break- 
throughs in  investigative  reporting.  For  example,  a  free-lance  jour- 
nalist published  the  first  public  accounts  of  Tanaka  Kakuei's 
personal  finances  in  a  monthly  magazine  in  1974,  even  though  the 
established  press  had  access  to  this  information. 

The  Liberal  Democratic  Party 

The  LDP  has  dominated  the  political  system  since  1955,  when 
it  was  established  as  a  coalition  of  smaller  conservative  groups.  All 
of  Japan's  prime  ministers  since  then  have  come  from  its  ranks 
as  have,  with  one  exception,  other  cabinet  ministers.  The  party's 
fortunes  have  risen  and  ebbed:  a  low  point  was  reached  in  the  July 
23,  1989,  election  to  the  upper  house,  when  it  became,  for  the  first 
time,  a  minority  party  (see  The  Structure  of  Government,  The 
Liberal  Democratic  Party  in  National  Elections,  this  ch.).  But  no 
opposition  party,  whether  singly  or  in  coalition,  was  able  to  oust 
the  LDP  from  power  and  form  a  government  of  its  own. 

By  the  early  1990s,  the  LDP's  nearly  four  decades  in  power  al- 
lowed it  to  establish  a  highly  stable  process  of  policy  formation. 
This  process  would  not  have  been  possible  if  other  parties  had  se- 
cured parliamentary  majorities.  LDP  strength  was  based  on  an  en- 
during, although  not  unchallenged,  coalition  of  big  business,  small 
business,  agriculture,  professional  groups,  and  other  interests.  Elite 
bureaucrats  collaborated  closely  with  the  party  and  interest  groups 
in  drafting  and  implementing  policy.  In  a  sense,  the  party's  suc- 
cess was  a  result  not  of  its  internal  strength  but  of  its  weakness. 
It  lacked  a  strong,  nationwide  organization  or  consistent  ideology 
with  which  to  attract  voters.  Its  leaders  were  rarely  decisive,  charis- 
matic, or  popular.  But  it  has  functioned  efficiently  as  a  locus  for 
matching  interest  group  money  and  votes  with  bureaucratic  power 
and  expertise.  This  arrangement  resulted  in  a  great  deal  of  cor- 
ruption, but  the  party  could  claim  credit  for  helping  to  create  eco- 
nomic growth  and  a  stable,  middle-class  Japan. 

Party  History  and  Basic  Principles 

The  LDP  has  a  complex  genealogy.  Its  roots  can  be  traced  to 
the  groups  established  by  Itagaki  Taisuke  and  Okuma  Shigenobu 
in  the  1880s  (see  The  Development  of  Representative  Government, 
ch.  1).  It  attained  its  present  form  in  November  1955,  when  the 
conservative  Liberal  Party  (Jiyuto)  and  Japan  Democratic  Party 
(Nihon  Minshuto)  united  in  response  to  the  threat  posed  by  a  uni- 
fied Japan  Socialist  Party,  which  had  been  established  the  month 


343 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


before.  The  union  of  the  two  has  often  been  described  as  a  "shot- 
gun marriage. ' '  Both  had  strong  leaders  and  had  previously  com- 
peted with  each  other.  The  Japan  Democratic  Party,  which  had 
been  established  only  a  year  before,  in  November  1954,  was  itself 
a  coalition  of  different  groups  in  which  farmers  were  prominent. 
The  result  of  the  new  amalgamation  was  a  large  party  that  repre- 
sented a  broad  spectrum  of  interests  but  had  minimal  organiza- 
tion compared  with  the  socialist  and  other  leftist  parties.  In  1976, 
in  the  wake  of  the  Lockheed  bribery  scandal,  a  handful  of  youn- 
ger LDP  Diet  members  broke  away  and  established  their  own  party, 
the  New  Liberal  Club  (Shin  Jiyu  Kurabu).  A  decade  later,  however, 
it  was  reabsorbed  by  the  LDP. 

Unlike  the  leftist  parties,  the  LDP  did  not  espouse  a  well-defined 
ideology  or  political  philosophy.  Its  members  held  a  variety  of  po- 
sitions that  could  be  broadly  defined  as  being  to  the  right  of  the 
opposition  parties,  yet  more  moderate  than  those  of  Japan's  numer- 
ous rightist  splinter  groups  (see  Political  Extremists,  this  ch.).  The 
LDP  traditionally  identified  itself  with  a  number  of  general  goals: 
rapid,  export-based  economic  growth,  close  cooperation  with  the 
United  States  in  foreign  and  defense  policies,  and  several  newer 
issues,  such  as  administrative  reform.  Administrative  reform  en- 
compassed several  themes:  simplification  and  streamlining  of 
government  bureaucracy,  privatization  of  state-owned  enterprises, 
and  the  adoption  of  measures,  including  tax  reform,  needed  to  pre- 
pare for  the  strain  on  the  economy  posed  by  an  aging  society.  Other 
priorities  in  the  early  1990s  included  promoting  a  more  active  and 
positive  role  for  Japan  in  the  rapidly  developing  Asia-Pacific  region, 
internationalizing  Japan's  economy  by  liberalizing  and  promot- 
ing domestic  demand,  creating  a  high- technology  information 
society,  and  promoting  scientific  research.  A  business-inspired  com- 
mitment to  free  enterprise  was  tempered  by  the  insistence  of  im- 
portant small  business  and  agricultural  constituencies  on  some  form 
of  protectionism. 

Party  Structure 

At  the  apex  of  the  LDP's  formal  organization  was  the  president, 
who  served  a  two-year  renewable  term.  Because  of  the  party's 
parliamentary  majority,  the  president  has  been  the  prime  minister. 
The  choice  was  formally  that  of  a  party  convention  composed  of 
Diet  members  and  local  LDP  figures,  but  in  most  cases,  they  merely 
approved  the  joint  decision  of  the  most  powerful  party  leaders.  To 
make  the  system  more  democratic,  Prime  Minister  Miki  Takeo 
introduced  a  "primary"  system  in  1978,  which  opened  the  ballot- 
ing to  some  1.5  million  LDP  members.  The  process  was  so  costly 


344 


The  Political  System 


and  acrimonious,  however,  that  it  was  subsequently  abandoned 
in  favor  of  the  old  "smoke-filled  room"  method. 

The  LDP  was  the  most  "traditionally  Japanese"  of  the  political 
parties  because  it  relied  on  a  complex  network  of  patron-client 
(pyabun-kobun)  relationships  on  both  national  and  local  levels.  Na- 
tionally, a  system  of  factions  in  both  the  House  of  Representatives 
and  the  House  of  Councillors  tied  individual  Diet  members  to  power- 
ful party  leaders.  Locally,  Diet  members  had  to  maintain  koenkai 
(local  support  groups)  to  keep  in  touch  with  public  opinion  and  gain 
votes  and  financial  backing.  The  importance  and  pervasiveness  of 
personal  ties  between  Diet  members  and  faction  leaders  and  between 
citizens  and  Diet  members  gave  the  party  a  pragmatic,  "you  scratch 
my  back,  I'll  scratch  yours"  character.  Its  success  depended  less 
on  generalized  mass  appeal  than  on  jiban  (a  strong,  well-organized 
constituency),  kaban  (a  briefcase  full  of  money),  and  kanban  (presti- 
gious appointment,  particularly  on  the  cabinet  level). 

Factions 

In  a  sense,  the  LDP  was  not  a  single  organization  but  a  con- 
glomeration of  competitive  factions,  which,  despite  the  traditional 
emphasis  on  consensus  and  harmony,  engaged  in  bitter  infight- 
ing. Over  the  years,  factions  numbered  from  6  to  13,  with  as  few 
as  4  members  and  as  many  as  120,  counting  those  in  both  houses. 
The  system  was  operative  in  both  houses,  although  it  was  more 
deeply  entrenched  in  the  House  of  Representatives  than  in  the  less 
powerful  House  of  Councillors.  Faction  leaders  usually  were  vet- 
eran LDP  politicians.  Many,  but  not  all,  had  served  as  prime 
minister. 

Faction  leaders  offered  their  followers  services  without  which  the 
followers  would  have  found  it  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  to  sur- 
vive politically.  Leaders  provided  funds  for  the  day-to-day  opera- 
tion of  Diet  members'  offices  and  staff  as  well  as  financial  support 
during  expensive  election  campaigns.  As  discussed  earlier,  the  oper- 
ating allowances  provided  by  the  government  were  inadequate.  The 
leader  also  introduced  his  followers  to  influential  bureaucracts  and 
business  people,  which  made  it  much  easier  for  the  followers  to 
satisfy  their  constituents'  demands. 

Historically,  the  most  powerful  and  aggressive  faction  leader  in 
the  LDP  was  Tanaka  Kakuei,  whose  dual-house  strength  in  the 
early  1980s  exceeded  110.  His  followers  remained  loyal  despite  the 
fact  that  he  had  been  convicted  of  receiving  ¥500  million  (nearly 
US$4  million)  in  bribes  from  the  American  aircraft  manufacturer, 
Lockheed,  to  facilitate  the  purchase  of  its  passenger  aircraft  by  All 
Nippon  Airways,  and  had  formally  withdrawn  from  the  LDP. 


345 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Tanaka  and  his  bitterest  factional  rival,  Fukuda  Takeo,  were  a  study 
in  contrasts.  Tanaka  was  a  rough-hewn  wheeler-dealer  with  a 
primary  school  education  who  had  made  a  fortune  in  the  construc- 
tion industry;  Fukuda  was  an  elite  product  of  the  University  of 
Tokyo  Law  Faculty  and  a  career  bureaucrat. 

In  the  face  of  Fukuda's  strong  opposition,  Tanaka  engineered 
the  selections  of  prime  ministers  Ohira  Masayoshi  (1978-80)  and 
Suzuki  Zenko  (1980-82).  The  accession  of  Nakasone  Yasuhiro  to 
the  prime  ministership  in  1982  would  also  not  have  occurred  without 
Tanaka' s  support  and,  as  a  result,  Nakasone,  at  that  time  a  politi- 
cally weak  figure,  was  nicknamed  "Tanakasone."  But  Tanaka's 
faction  was  dealt  a  grave  blow  when  one  of  his  subordinates, 
Takeshita  Noboru,  decided  to  form  a  breakaway  group.  Tanaka 
suffered  a  stroke  in  November  1985,  but  four  years  passed  before 
he  formally  retired  from  politics. 

The  LDP  faction  system  was  closely  fitted  to  the  House  of 
Representatives'  medium-sized,  multiple-member  election  districts. 
The  party  usually  ran  more  than  one  candidate  in  each  of  these 
constituencies  to  maintain  its  lower  house  majority,  and  these  can- 
didates were  from  different  factions.  During  an  election  campaign, 
the  LDP,  in  a  real  sense,  ran  not  only  against  the  opposition  but 
also  against  itself.  In  fact,  intraparty  competition  within  one  elec- 
tion district  was  often  more  bitter  than  interparty  competition,  with 
two  or  more  LDP  candidates  vying  for  the  same  block  of  conser- 
vative votes.  For  example,  in  the  general  election  of  February  18, 
1990,  three  LDP  and  three  opposition  candidates  competed  for  five 
seats  in  a  southwestern  prefecture.  Two  of  the  LDP  candidates  pub- 
licly expressed  bitterness  over  the  entry  of  the  third,  a  son  of  the 
prefectural  governor.  Local  television  showed  supporters  of  one 
of  the  LDP  candidates  cheering  loudly  when  the  governor's  son 
was  edged  out  for  the  fifth  seat  by  a  Komeito  candidate. 

Local  Support  Groups 

In  the  early  1990s,  kdenkai  (local  support  groups)  were  perhaps 
even  more  important  than  faction  membership  to  the  survival  of 
LDP  Diet  members.  These  kdenkai  served  as  pipelines  through  which 
funds  and  other  support  were  conveyed  to  legislators  and  through 
which  the  legislators  could  distribute  favors  to  constituents  in  return. 
To  avoid  the  stringent  legal  restrictions  on  political  activity  out- 
side of  designated  campaign  times,  kdenkai  sponsored  year-round 
cultural,  social,  and  "educational"  activities.  In  the  prewar  years, 
having  an  invincible,  or  "iron,"  constituency  depended  on  gain- 
ing the  support  of  landlords  and  other  local  notables.  These  peo- 
ple delivered  blocks  of  rural  votes  to  the  candidates  they  favored. 


346 


The  Political  System 


In  the  more  pluralistic  postwar  period,  local  bosses  were  much  weak- 
er and  building  a  strong  constituency  base  much  more  difficult  and 
costly.  Tanaka  used  his  "iron  constituency"  in  rural  Niigata  Prefec- 
ture to  build  a  formidable,  nationwide  political  machine;  but  other 
politicians,  like  Ito  Masayoshi,  were  so  popular  in  their  districts 
that  they  could  refrain,  to  some  extent,  from  money  politics  and 
promote  a  "clean"  image.  Kdenkai  remained  particularly  impor- 
tant in  the  overrepresented  rural  areas,  where  paternalistic,  old- 
style  politics  flourished  and  where  the  LDP,  despite  disaffection 
during  the  late  1980s  over  agricultural  liberalization  policies,  had 
its  strongest  support. 

In  the  classic  oyabun-kobun  manner,  local  people  who  were  con- 
sistently loyal  to  a  figure  like  Tanaka  become  favored  recipients 
of  government  largesse.  In  the  1980s,  his  own  third  electoral  dis- 
trict in  Niigata  was  the  nation's  top  beneficiary  in  per  capita  pub- 
lic works  spending.  Benefits  included  stops  on  the  Shinkansen  bullet 
train  to  Tokyo  and  the  cutting  of  a  tunnel  through  a  mountain  to 
serve  a  hamlet  of  sixty  people  (see  Transportation  and  Communi- 
cations, ch.  4).  Another  fortunate  area  was  Takeshita  Noboru's 
district  in  Shimane  Prefecture  on  the  Sea  of  Japan. 

The  importance  of  local  loyalties  was  also  reflected  in  the 
widespread  practice  of  a  second  generation's  "inheriting"  Diet  seats 
from  fathers  or  fathers-in-law.  This  trend  was  found  predominandy, 
though  not  exclusively,  in  the  LDP.  In  the  February  1990  general 
election,  for  example,  forty- three  second- generation  candidates  ran: 
twenty- two,  including  twelve  LDP  candidates,  were  successful. 
They  included  the  sons  of  former  prime  ministers  Suzuki  Zenko 
and  Fukuda  Takeo,  although  a  son-in-law  of  Tanaka  Kakuei  lost 
in  a  district  different  from  his  father-in-law's. 

The  Liberal  Democratic  Party  in  National  Elections 

Election  statistics  show  that,  while  the  LDP  had  been  able  to 
secure  a  majority  in  the  twelve  House  of  Representatives  elections 
from  May  1958  to  February  1990,  with  only  three  exceptions  (De- 
cember 1976,  October  1979,  and  December  1983),  its  share  of  the 
popular  vote  had  declined  from  a  high  of  57.8  percent  in  May  1958 
to  a  low  of  41 .8  percent  in  December  1976,  when  voters  expressed 
their  disgust  with  the  party's  involvement  in  the  Lockheed  scan- 
dal (see  fig.  9;  table  37,  Appendix).  The  LDP  vote  rose  again  be- 
tween 1979  and  1990.  Although  the  LDP  won  an  unprecedented 
300  seats  in  the  July  1986  balloting,  its  share  of  the  popular  vote 
remained  just  under  50  percent.  The  figure  was  46.2  percent  in 
February  1990.  Following  the  three  occasions  when  the  LDP  found 
itself  a  handful  of  seats  shy  of  a  majority,  it  was  obliged  to  form

The  Political  System 


alliances  with  conservative  independents  and  the  breakaway  New 
Liberal  Club.  In  a  cabinet  appointment  after  the  October  1983  bal- 
loting, a  non-LDP  minister,  a  member  of  the  New  Liberal  Club, 
was  appointed  for  the  first  time. 

In  the  upper  house,  the  July  1989  election  represented  the  first 
time  that  the  LDP  was  forced  into  a  minority  position.  In  previ- 
ous elections,  it  had  either  secured  a  majority  on  its  own  or  recruited 
non-LDP  conservatives  to  make  up  the  difference  of  a  few  seats. 

The  political  crisis  of  1988-89  was  testimony  to  both  the  party's 
strength  and  its  weakness.  In  the  wake  of  a  succession  of  issues — 
the  pushing  of  a  highly  unpopular  consumption  tax  through  the 
Diet  in  late  1988,  the  Recruit  insider  trading  scandal,  which  tainted 
virtually  all  top  LDP  leaders  and  forced  the  resignation  of  Prime 
Minister  Takeshita  Noboru  in  April  (a  successor  did  not  appear 
until  June),  the  resignation  in  July  of  his  successor,  Uno  Sosuke, 
because  of  a  sex  scandal,  and  the  poor  showing  in  the  upper  house 
election — the  media  provided  the  Japanese  with  a  detailed  and  em- 
barrassing dissection  of  the  political  system.  By  March  1989,  popu- 
lar support  for  the  Takeshita  cabinet  as  expressed  in  public  opinion 
polls  had  fallen  to  9  percent.  Uno's  scandal,  covered  in  magazine 
interviews  of  a  "kiss  and  tell"  geisha,  aroused  the  fury  of  female 
voters. 

Yet  Uno's  successor,  the  eloquent  if  obscure  Kaifu  Toshiki,  was 
successful  in  repairing  the  party's  battered  image.  By  January  1990, 
talk  of  the  waning  of  conservative  power  and  a  possible  socialist 
government  had  given  way  to  the  realization  that,  like  the  Lock- 
heed affair  of  the  mid-1970s,  the  Recruit  scandal  did  not  signal 
a  significant  change  in  who  ruled  Japan.  The  February  1990  general 
election  gave  the  LDP,  including  affiliated  independents,  a  com- 
fortable, if  not  spectacular,  majority:  286  of  512  total  represen- 
tatives. 

In  light  of  radical  changes  in  other  parts  of  the  world  during  the 
late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  particularly  the  collapse  of  the  com- 
munist status  quo  in  Eastern  Europe,  the  LDP's  durability  seemed 
odd  to  outsiders.  One  explanation  is  that  the  LDP  has  grown  quite 
skillful  in  manipulating  the  rituals  of  repentance.  In  1989  Takeshita 
and  other  leaders  expressed  kejime  (a  very  difficult  term  to  trans- 
late, although  "knowing  how  to  act  under  the  circumstances"  in- 
dicates some  of  its  meaning),  begging  the  voters  to  accept  their 
promise  that  they  would  do  better  in  the  future  and  would  imple- 
ment "political  reform."  Before  the  general  election,  the  ruling 
party  also  promised  to  consider  revision,  although  not  abolition, 
of  the  consumption  tax.  The  overall  economic  well-being  of  most 
of  the  population,  particularly  in  comparison  with  their  own  lives, 


349 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

or  those  of  their  parents,  in  the  immediate  postwar  period,  is  another 
factor  contributing  to  LDP  sustainability.  But  the  election  results 
suggested  to  many  that,  despite  the  furor,  the  voters  were  less  in- 
terested in  "throwing  the  rascals  out"  than,  in  the  quintessentially 
Confucian  way,  having  them  "reflect"  on  their  errors. 

An  additional  factor  of  major  importance  was  the  perceived  in- 
ability of  the  opposition  parties,  some  of  whom  were  also  tarnished 
by  the  Recruit  scandal,  to  form  a  competent  alternative  govern- 
ment (see  The  Opposition  Parties,  this  ch.).  The  strongly  interest- 
oriented  nature  of  Japanese  politics,  moreover,  meant  that  many 
people  were  tied  to  local  patronage  networks  that  would  suffer  if 
the  socialists  or  other  opposition  groups  gained  power.  Many  voters 
admitted,  "I  don't  like  the  LDP,  but  I  really  had  no  choice." 

Bureaucrats  and  the  Policy-Making  Process 

The  Japanese  had  been  exposed  to  bureaucratic  institutions  at 
least  by  the  early  seventh  century  A.D.,  when  the  imperial  court 
adopted  the  laws  and  government  structure  of  Tang  China  (see 
Nara  and  Heian  Periods,  A.D.  710-1185,  ch.  1).  The  distinctive 
Chinese  institution  of  civil  service  examinations  never  took  root, 
and  the  imported  system  was  never  successfully  imposed  on  the 
country  at  large.  But  by  the  middle  of  the  Tokugawa  period 
(1600-1867),  the  samurai  class  functions  had  evolved  from  war- 
rior to  clerical  and  administrative  functions.  Following  the  Meiji 
Restoration  (1868),  the  new  elite,  which  came  from  the  lower  ranks 
of  the  samurai,  established  a  Western-style  civil  service  (see  The 
Emergence  of  Modern  Japan,  1868-1919,  ch.  1). 

Although  the  United  States  occupation  dismantled  both  the  mili- 
tary and  zaibatsu  (see  Glossary)  establishments,  it  did  little,  out- 
side of  abolishing  the  prewar  Home  Ministry,  to  challenge  the  power 
of  the  bureaucracy.  There  was  considerable  continuity — in  insti- 
tutions, operating  style,  and  personnel — between  the  civil  service 
before  and  after  the  occupation,  partly  because  MacArthur's  staff 
ruled  indirectly  and  depended  largely  on  the  cooperation  of  civil 
servants.  A  process  of  mutual  cooptation  occurred.  Also,  United 
States  policy  planners  never  regarded  the  civil  service  with  the  same 
opprobrium  as  the  military  or  economic  elites.  The  civil  service's 
role  in  Japan's  militarism  was  generally  downplayed.  Many  of  the 
occupation  figures  themselves  were  products  of  President  Franklin  D. 
Roosevelt's  New  Deal  and  had  strong  faith  in  the  merits  of  civil 
service  "professionalism."  Finally,  the  perceived  threat  of  the  Soviet 
Union  in  the  late  1940s  created  a  community  of  interests  for  the 
occupiers  and  conservative,  social  order-conscious  administrators.

The  Political  System 


The  Civil  Service 

In  trying  to  discover  "who's  in  charge  here,"  many  analysts  have 
pointed  to  the  elite  bureaucracy  as  the  people  who  really  governed 
Japan,  although  they  composed  only  a  tiny  fraction  of  the  coun- 
try's more  than  1  million  national  government  employees.  In  the 
early  1990s,  several  hundred  of  the  elite  were  employed  at  each 
national  ministry  or  agency.  Although  entry  into  the  elite  through 
open  examinations  did  not  require  a  college  degree,  the  majority 
of  its  members  were  alumni  of  Japan's  most  prestigious  universi- 
ties. The  University  of  Tokyo  Law  Faculty  remained  in  the  early 
1990s  the  single  most  important  source  of  elite  bureaucrats.  After 
graduation  from  college  and,  increasingly,  some  graduate-level 
study,  applicants  took  a  series  of  extremely  difficult  higher  civil 
service  examinations:  in  1988,  for  example,  28,833  took  the  tests, 
but  only  1,814,  or  6.3  percent,  were  successful.  Of  the  successful 
number,  721  were  actually  hired.  Like  the  scholar-officials  of  im- 
perial China,  successful  candidates  were  hardy  survivors  of  a  gruel- 
ing education  and  testing  process  that  necessarily  began  in  early 
childhood  and  demanded  total  concentration.  The  typical  young 
bureaucrat,  who  in  the  early  1990s  was  in  most  cases  male,  was 
an  intelligent,  hardworking,  and  dedicated  individual.  Some  bu- 
reaucrats lacked  imagination  and,  perhaps,  compassion  for  peo- 
ple whose  way  of  life  was  different  from  their  own. 

The  public's  attitude  toward  the  elite  was  ambivalent.  The  elite 
enjoyed  tremendous  social  prestige,  but  members  were  also  re- 
sented. They  lived  in  a  realm  that  was  at  least  partly  public  yet 
far  removed  from  the  lives  of  ordinary  people.  Compared  with  poli- 
ticians, they  were  generally  viewed  as  honest.  Involvement  of  top 
officials  in  scandals  such  as  the  Recruit  affair,  however,  had,  to 
some  extent,  tarnished  their  image. 

Japan's  elite  bureaucrats  were  insulated  from  direct  political  pres- 
sure because  there  were  very  few  political  appointments  in  the  civil 
service.  Cabinet  ministers  were  usually  career  politicians,  but  they 
were  moved  in  and  out  of  their  posts  quite  frequentiy  (with  an  aver- 
age tenure  of  under  a  year),  and  usually  had  little  opportunity  to 
develop  a  power  base  within  a  ministry  or  force  their  civil  service 
subordinates  to  adopt  reforms.  Below  the  cabinet  minister  was  the 
administrative  vice  minister.  Administrative  vice  ministers  and  their 
subordinates  were  career  civil  servants  whose  appointments  were 
determined  in  accordance  with  an  internally  established  principle 
of  seniority. 

In  a  1975  article,  political  scientist  Chalmers  Johnson  quotes  a 
retired  vice  minister  of  the  Ministry  of  International  Trade  and 
Industry  (MITI),  who  said  that  the  Diet  was  merely  "an  extension 


351

of  the  bureaucracy."  The  official  claimed  that  "the  bureaucracy 
drafts  all  the  laws.  .  .  .  All  the  legislature  does  is  to  use  its  powers 
of  investigation,  which  for  about  half  the  year  keeps  most  of  the 
senior  officials  cooped  up  in  the  Diet." 

In  the  years  since  this  official  made  his  proud  boast,  however, 
it  has  become  apparent  that  there  are  limits  to  the  bureaucrats' 
power.  The  most  important  check  was  the  LDP's  growing  role  in 
policy  formation.  Political  scientist  B.C.  Koh  suggested  that  in  many 
cases  members  of  the  LDP  policy-oriented  tribes  (zoku)  had  greater 
expertise  in  their  fields  than  elite  bureaucrats.  Before  the  latter 
drafted  legislation,  they  had  to  consult  and  follow  the  initiatives 
of  the  party's  Policy  Research  Council.  Many  analysts  consider 
the  role  of  the  bureaucracy  in  drafting  legislation  to  be  no  greater 
than  that  of  its  counterparts  in  France,  the  Federal  Republic  of 
Germany  (West  Germany),  and  other  countries.  Also,  the  deci- 
sion of  many  retired  bureaucrats  to  run  as  LDP  candidates  for  the 
Diet  might  not  reflect,  as  had  been  previously  assumed,  the  power 
of  the  officials  but  rather  the  impatience  of  ambitious  men  who 
wanted  to  locate  themselves,  politically,  "where  the  action  is." 

An  intense  rivalry  among  the  ministries  came  into  play  whenever 
major  policy  decisions  were  formulated.  Elite  civil  servants  were 
recruited  by  and  spent  their  entire  careers  in  a  single  ministry.  As 
a  result,  they  developed  a  strong  sectional  solidarity  and  zealously 
defended  their  turf.  Nonbureaucratic  actors — the  politicians  and 
interest  groups — could  use  this  rivalry  to  their  own  advantage. 

The  Ministry  of  Finance  was  generally  considered  the  most 
powerful  and  prestigious  of  the  ministries.  Its  top  officials  were 
regarded  as  the  cream  of  the  elite.  Although  it  was  relatively  un- 
successful in  the  1970s  when  the  deficit  rose,  the  ministry  was  very 
successful  in  the  1980s  in  constraining  government  spending  and 
raising  taxes,  including  a  twelve-year  battle  to  get  a  consumption 
tax  passed.  The  huge  national  debt  in  the  early  1990s,  however, 
may  turn  out  to  be  evidence  that  this  budget-minded  body  had  been 
unsuccessful  in  the  previous  decade  in  curbing  demands  for  popu- 
lar policies  such  as  health  insurance,  rice  price  supports,  and  the 
unprofitable  nationwide  network  of  the  privatized  Japan  Railways 
Group.  MITI  frequently  encountered  obstacles  in  its  early  post- 
occupation  plans  to  reconsolidate  the  economy.  It  was  not  always 
successful  in  imposing  its  will  on  private  interests,  politicians,  or 
other  ministries.  According  to  law  professor  John  O.  Haley,  writ- 
ing in  the  late  1980s,  MITI's  practice  of  gyosei  shido,  or  adminis- 
trative guidance,  often  described  as  evidence  of  the  bureaucracy's 
hidden  power,  was  in  fact  a  second-best  alternative  to  "express 
statutory  authority  that  would  have  legitimated  its  exercise  of 


352 


The  Political  System 


authority."  Administrative  reform  policies  in  the  1980s  imposed 
ceilings  on  civil  service  staff  and  spending  that  probably  contributed 
to  a  deterioration  of  morale  and  working  conditions. 

Still  another  factor  limiting  bureaucratic  power  was  the  emer- 
gence of  an  affluent  society.  In  the  early  postwar  period,  the  scar- 
city of  capital  made  it  possible  for  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  MITI 
to  exert  considerable  influence  over  the  economy  through  control 
of  the  banking  system  (see  The  Financial  System,  ch.  4).  To  a 
decreasing  extent,  this  scarcity  remained  until  the  1980s  because 
most  major  companies  had  high  debt-equity  ratios  and  depended 
on  the  banks  for  infusions  of  capital.  Their  huge  profits  and  in- 
creasing reliance  on  securities  markets  in  the  late  1980s,  however, 
meant  that  the  Ministry  of  Finance  had  less  influence.  The  wealth, 
technical  sophistication,  and  new  confidence  of  the  companies  also 
made  it  difficult  for  MITI  to  exercise  administrative  guidance.  The 
ministry  could  not  restrain  aggressive  and  often  politically  con- 
troversial purchases  by  Japanese  corporate  investors  in  the  United 
States,  for  example,  Mitsubishi  Estate's  October  1989  purchase 
of  Rockefeller  Center  in  New  York  City,  which,  along  with  the 
Sony  Corporation's  acquisition  of  Columbia  Pictures  several  weeks 
earlier,  heated  up  trade  friction  between  the  two  countries. 

The  whole  issue  of  trade  friction  and  foreign  pressure  tended 
to  politicize  the  bureaucracy  and  promote  unprecedented  divisive- 
ness  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s.  During  the  Structural  Im- 
pediments Initiative  talks  held  by  Japan  and  the  United  States  in 
early  1990,  basic  changes  in  Japan's  economy  were  discussed:  re- 
forms of  the  distribution  and  pricing  systems,  improvement  of  the 
infrastructure,  and  elimination  of  official  procedures  that  limited 
foreign  participation  in  the  economy  (see  Trade  and  Investment 
Relations,  ch.  5).  Although  foreign  pressure  of  this  sort  was  resented 
by  many  Japanese  as  an  intrusion  on  national  sovereignty,  it  also 
provided  an  opportunity  for  certain  ministries  to  make  gains  at  the 
expense  of  others.  There  was  hardly  a  bureaucratic  jurisdiction  in 
the  economic  sphere  that  was  not  in  some  sense  affected. 

Repeatedly,  internationally  minded  political  and  bureaucratic 
elites  found  their  market-opening  reforms,  designed  to  placate 
American  demands,  sabotaged  by  other  interests,  especially  agricul- 
ture. Such  reactions  intensified  American  pressure,  which  in  turn 
created  a  sense  of  crisis  and  a  siege  mentality  within  Japan.  The 
"internationalization"  of  Japan's  society  in  other  ways  also  divided 
the  bureaucratic  elite.  MITI,  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  and  the  Minis- 
try of  Justice  had  divergent  views  on  how  to  respond  to  the  influx 
of  unskilled,  usually  South  Asian  and  Southeast  Asian,  laborers 
into  the  labor-starved  Japanese  economy.  An  estimated  300,000 


353 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

to  400,000  of  them  worked  illegally  for  small  Japanese  firms  in  the 
late  1980s.  Ministry  of  Education,  Science,  and  Culture  revision 
of  guidelines  on  the  writing  of  history  textbooks,  ostensibly  a  domes- 
tic matter,  aroused  the  indignation  of  Japan's  Asian  neighbors  be- 
cause the  changes  tended  to  soften  accounts  of  wartime  atrocities. 

Policy-Making  Dynamics 

Despite  an  increasingly  unpredictable  domestic  and  international 
environment,  policy  making  in  the  early  1990s  conformed  to  well- 
established  postwar  patterns.  The  close  collaboration  of  the  ruling 
party,  the  elite  bureaucracy,  and  important  interest  groups  often 
made  it  difficult  to  tell  who  exactly  was  responsible  for  specific  policy 
decisions.  The  tendency  for  insiders  to  guard  information  on  such 
matters  carefully  compounded  the  difficulty,  especially  for  foreigners 
wishing  to  understand  how  domestic  decision  making  could  be  in- 
fluenced to  reduce  trade  problems. 

The  Human  Factor 

The  most  important  human  factor  in  the  policy-making  process 
was  the  homogeneity  of  the  political  and  business  elites.  In  the  early 
1990s,  they  still  tended  to  be  graduates  of  a  relatively  small  num- 
ber of  top-ranked  universities.  Regardless  of  these  individuals' 
regional  or  class  origins,  their  similar  educational  backgrounds  en- 
couraged their  feeling  of  community,  as  was  reflected  in  the  finely 
meshed  network  of  marriage  alliances  between  top  official,  LDP 
and  financial  circle  (zaikai)  families.  The  institution  of  early  retire- 
ment also  fostered  homogeneity.  In  the  practice  of  amakudari,  or 
descent  from  heaven,  as  it  is  popularly  known,  bureaucrats  retir- 
ing in  their  fifties  often  assumed  top  positions  in  public  corpora- 
tions and  private  enterprise.  They  also  became  LDP  politicians. 
By  the  late  1980s,  most  postwar  prime  ministers  had  had  civil  service 
backgrounds. 

This  homogeneity  facilitated  the  free  flow  of  ideas  among  mem- 
bers of  the  elite  in  informal  settings.  Bureaucrats  and  business  people 
associated  with  a  single  industry,  such  as  electronics,  often  held 
regular  informal  meetings  in  Tokyo  hotels  and  restaurants.  Politi- 
cal scientist  T.J.  Pempel  has  pointed  out  that  the  concentration 
of  political  and  economic  power  in  Tokyo — particularly  the  small 
geographic  area  of  its  central  wards — made  it  easy  for  leaders,  who 
were  almost  without  exception  denizens  of  the  capital,  to  have 
repeated  personal  contact.  Another  often  overlooked  factor  was  the 
tendency  of  elite  males  not  to  be  family  men.  Late  night  work  and 
bar-hopping  schedules  gave  them  ample  opportunity  to  hash  and 
rehash  policy  matters  and  engage  in  haragei  (literally,  belly  art), 


354 


The  Political  System 


or  intimate,  often  nonverbal  communication.  Like  the  warriors  of 
ancient  Sparta,  who  lived  in  barracks  apart  from  their  families  dur- 
ing much  of  their  adulthood,  the  business  and  bureaucratic  elites 
were  expected  to  sacrifice  their  private  lives  for  the  national  good. 

Formal  Policy  Development 

After  a  largely  informal  process  within  elite  circles  in  which  ideas 
were  discussed  and  developed,  steps  might  be  taken  to  institute 
more  formal  policy  development.  This  process  often  took  place  in 
deliberation  councils  {shingikai).  There  were  about  200  shingikai, 
each  attached  to  a  ministry;  their  members  were  both  officials  and 
prominent  private  individuals  in  business,  education,  and  other 
fields.  The  shingikai  played  a  large  role  in  facilitating  communica- 
tion among  those  who  ordinarily  might  not  meet.  Given  the  ten- 
dency for  real  negotiations  in  Japan  to  be  conducted  privately  (in 
the  nemawashi,  or  root  binding,  process  of  consensus  building),  the 
shingikai  often  represented  a  fairly  advanced  stage  in  policy  formu- 
lation in  which  relatively  minor  differences  could  be  thrashed  out 
and  the  resulting  decisions  couched  in  language  acceptable  to  all. 
These  bodies  were  legally  established,  but  had  no  authority  to  ob- 
lige governments  to  adopt  their  recommendations. 

The  most  important  deliberation  council  during  the  1980s  was 
the  Provisional  Commission  for  Administrative  Reform,  established 
in  March  1981  by  Prime  Minister  Suzuki  Zenko.  The  commission 
had  nine  members,  assisted  in  their  deliberations  by  six  advisers, 
twenty- one  "expert  members,"  and  around  fifty  "councillors" 
representing  a  wide  range  of  groups.  Its  head,  Keidanren  pres- 
ident Doko  Toshio,  insisted  that  government  agree  to  take  its 
recommendations  seriously  and  commit  itself  to  reforming  the  ad- 
ministrative structure  and  the  tax  system.  In  1982  the  commission 
had  arrived  at  several  recommendations  that  by  the  end  of  the  de- 
cade had  been  actualized.  These  implementations  included  tax  re- 
form; a  policy  to  limit  government  growth;  the  establishment,  in 
1984,  of  the  Management  and  Coordination  Agency  to  replace  the 
Administrative  Management  Agency  in  the  Office  of  the  Prime 
Minister;  and  privatization  of  the  state-owned  railroad  and  tele- 
phone systems.  In  April  1990,  another  deliberation  council,  the 
Election  Systems  Research  Council,  submitted  proposals  that  in- 
cluded the  establishment  of  single- seat  constituencies  in  place  of 
the  multiple- seat  system. 

Another  significant  policy-making  institution  in  the  early  1990s 
was  the  LDP's  Policy  Research  Council.  It  consisted  of  a  number 
of  committees,  composed  of  LDP  Diet  members,  with  the  commit- 
tees corresponding  to  the  different  executive  agencies.  Committee 


355

members  worked  closely  with  their  official  counterparts,  advanc- 
ing the  requests  of  their  constituents,  in  one  of  the  most  effective 
means  through  which  interest  groups  could  state  their  case  to  the 
bureaucracy  through  the  channel  of  the  ruling  party. 

The  Budget  Process 

Despite  the  increasingly  apparent  limits  of  bureaucratic  power, 
the  Budget  Bureau  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  was  at  the  heart  of 
the  political  process  because  it  drew  up  the  national  budget  each 
year.  This  responsibility  made  it  the  ultimate  focus  of  interest 
groups,  through  the  medium  of  the  LDP  and  of  other  ministries 
that  competed  for  limited  funds.  The  budgetary  process  generally 
began  soon  after  the  start  of  a  new  fiscal  year  on  April  1 .  Minis- 
tries and  government  agencies  prepared  budget  requests  in  con- 
sultation with  the  Policy  Research  Council.  In  the  fall  of  each  year, 
Budget  Bureau  examiners  reviewed  these  requests  in  great  detail, 
while  top  Ministry  of  Finance  officials  worked  out  the  general  con- 
tours of  the  new  budget  and  the  distribution  of  tax  revenues.  Dur- 
ing the  winter,  after  the  release  of  the  ministry's  draft  budget, 
campaigning  by  individual  Diet  members  for  their  constituents  and 
different  ministries  for  revisions  and  supplementary  allocations  be- 
came intense.  LDP  and  Ministry  of  Finance  officials  consulted  on 
a  final  draft  budget,  which  was  generally  passed  by  the  Diet  in  late 
winter. 

In  broad  outline,  the  process  revealed  a  basic  characteristic  of 
Japanese  political  dynamics:  that  despite  the  oft-stated  ideals  of 
"harmony"  and  "consensus,"  interests,  including  bureaucratic 
interests,  were  in  strong  competition  for  resources.  LDP  leaders 
and  Budget  Bureau  officials  needed  great  skill  to  reach  mutually 
acceptable  compromises.  The  image  of  "Japan  Incorporated,"  in 
which  harmony  and  unanimity  were  virtually  automatic,  belied 
the  reality  of  intense  rivalry.  The  late  twentieth-century  system  was 
successful  insofar  as  superior  political  skills  and  appreciation  of  com- 
mon interests  minimized  antagonisms  and  maintained  an  accept- 
able balance  of  power  among  groups.  Whether  this  system  would 
continue,  as  Japan  faced  such  problems  as  growing  social  inequal- 
ity, an  aging  society,  and  the  challenge  of  "internationalization" 
of  its  society  and  economy,  in  the  early  1990s  remained  unclear. 

The  Opposition  Parties 

With  the  exception  of  the  period  from  May  1947  to  March  1948, 
when  a  socialist,  Katayama  Tetsu,  was  prime  minster,  heading  a 
coalition  of  socialists  and  conservatives,  opposition  parties  failed 
to  gain  enough  national  electoral  support  to  participate  in  forming 


356 


The  Political  System 


a  cabinet  or  to  form  one  of  their  own.  In  1990,  major  opposition 
parties  with  representation  in  the  Diet  were  the  Japan  Socialist 
Party,  the  Komeito,  the  Japan  Communist  Party,  and  the  Demo- 
cratic Socialist  Party  (Minshato).  Two  smaller  opposition  parties 
were  the  Socialist  Democratic  League  and  the  Progressive  Party 
(Shimpoto).  None  had  a  sufficiently  broad  base  of  support  to 
challenge  the  LDP  at  the  polls,  and  in  the  early  1990s,  they  had 
not  been  able  to  form  workable  coalitions.  An  exception  occurred 
in  some  local  elections,  where  "progressive"  coalitions  were  more 
effective  in  electing  opposition  candidates  than  on  the  national  level. 

The  opposition  parties  were  separated  by  ideology,  with  the  Japan 
Communist  Party  and  a  significant  faction  of  the  Japan  Socialist 
Party  espousing  Marxist  revolution;  the  others  were  moderate  and 
pragmatic.  In  many  cases,  the  programs  of  the  Komeito  and 
Democratic  Socialist  Party  differed  little  from  those  of  the  LDP. 
Unlike  the  Japan  Socialist  Party,  smaller  opposition  parties  lacked 
the  resources  to  run  candidates  in  all  the  country's  constituencies. 

On  occasions  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  it  seemed  that  the  end  of 
conservative  power  was  at  hand.  One  such  time  was  following  the 
Lockheed  scandal  of  the  mid-1970s  (a  journalist  at  the  time 
described  it  as  "conservative  power  self-destructs");  another  was 
the  combined  furor  over  the  3  percent  consumption  tax  and  the 
Recruit  scandal  in  1988-89.  When  the  LDP  was  pushed  into  the 
minority  in  the  July  1989  upper-house  election,  many  commenta- 
tors believed  that  Doi  Takako,  chairwoman  and  leader  of  the  Japan 
Socialist  Party,  was  within  striking  distance  of  forming  a  govern- 
ment, probably  in  coalition  with  other  opposition  groups,  in  the 
upcoming,  more  important  general  election  for  the  lower  house. 
That  this  situation  failed  to  materialize  suggested  not  so  much  popu- 
lar contentment  with  the  LDP  as  the  opposition's  inability  to  present 
a  viable  alternative  to  voters. 

The  opposition  was  important  if  only  because  its  existence 
legitimized  Japan's  claim  to  be  a  modern,  democratic  state. 
Moreover,  the  Japan  Socialist  Party  and  Japan  Communist  Party 
played  a  major  role  in  the  1950s  and  1960s  in  protecting  the 
democratic  institutions  promoted  by  the  United  States  occupation. 
The  opposition's  control  of  more  than  one-third  of  the  seats  in  the 
Diet  meant  that  amendments  revising  the  Constitution  (such  as 
the  proposed  rewording  or  abolition  of  Article  9)  could  not  be 
passed.  If  conservatives  had  had  their  way  in  the  early  postwar 
years,  some  of  Japan's  prewar  symbols  and  military  power  would 
have  been  restored,  a  move  that  most  likely  would  have  greatly 
affected  relations  with  East  Asian  and  Southeast  Asian  countries, 


357

where  bitter  memories  of  Japanese  wartime  occupation  remained 
fresh. 

In  a  political  system  where  the  ruling  party  habitually  swept  em- 
barrassing matters  under  the  carpet  and  the  established  press  club 
system  inhibited  investigative  reporting,  the  opposition  functioned 
reasonably  well,  to  use  film  scholar  Donald  Richie's  phrase,  as  "car- 
pet picker-uppers."  They  exposed  and  demanded  parliamentary 
investigations  of  scandals  like  the  Recruit  affair.  Routinely,  they 
used  meetings  of  the  Budget  Committee  and  other  committees  in 
the  Diet  to  question  cabinet  ministers  and  government  officials, 
and  these  sessions  received  wide  media  publicity. 

Ideas  first  proposed  by  the  opposition,  such  as  national  health 
insurance  and  other  social  welfare  measures,  were  frequently 
adopted  and  implemented  by  the  ruling  party.  The  '  'Eda  Vision' ' 
of  moderate  socialist  leader  Eda  Saburo  in  the  early  1960s — "An 
American  standard  of  living,  Soviet  levels  of  social  welfare,  a  Brit- 
ish parliamentary  system,  and  Japan's  peace  constitution" — were 
largely  realized  under  LDP  auspices. 

Although  opposition  control  of  the  upper  house  after  the  July 
1989  election  represented  a  change,  the  opposition  had  little  im- 
pact on  the  legislative  process.  Regulations  in  the  Diet  Law  and 
the  rules  of  the  two  houses  gave  presiding  House  of  Representa- 
tives officers  the  power  to  convene  plenary  sessions,  fix  agendas, 
and  limit  debates.  Because  these  officers  were  elected  by  the  LDP 
majority,  they  used  these  powers  to  constrain  opposition  party  ac- 
tivity. Although  the  opposition  could  not  filibuster,  the  lack  of  a 
time  limit  for  formal  balloting  allowed  them  to  use  the  gyuho  senjutsu 
(cow's  pace  tactics)  to  cause  excruciating  delays  in  the  passage  of 
LDP-sponsored  bills,  walking  so  slowly  to  cast  their  individual  votes 
that  the  process  took  several  hours,  sorely  trying  the  tempers  of 
LDP  Diet  members. 

Japan  Socialist  Party 

The  Japan  Socialist  Party  was  the  largest  opposition  party  in 
the  early  1990s.  Like  the  LDP,  it  resulted  from  the  union  of  two 
smaller  groups  in  1955.  The  new  opposition  party  had  its  own  fac- 
tions, although  organized  according  to  left- right  ideological  com- 
mitments rather  than  what  it  called  the  "feudal  personalism"  of 
the  conservative  parties.  In  the  House  of  Representatives  election 
of  1958,  the  Japan  Socialist  Party  gained  32.9  percent  of  the  popular 
vote  and  166  out  of  467  seats.  After  that,  its  percentage  of  the  popu- 
lar vote  and  number  of  seats  gradually  declined.  In  the  double  elec- 
tion of  July  1986  for  both  Diet  houses,  the  party  suffered  a  rout 
by  the  LDP  under  Nakasone:  its  seats  in  the  lower  house  fell  from 


358 


The  Political  System 


112  to  an  all-time  low  of  85  and  its  share  of  the  vote  from  19.5 
percent  to  17.2  percent.  But  its  popular  chairwoman,  Doi  Takako, 
led  it  to  an  impressive  showing  in  the  February  1 990  general  elec- 
tion: 136  seats  and  24.4  percent  of  the  vote.  Some  electoral  dis- 
tricts had  more  than  one  successful  socialist  candidate.  Doi's 
decision  to  put  up  more  than  one  candidate  for  each  of  the  130 
districts  represented  a  controversial  break  with  the  past,  because, 
unlike  their  LDP  counterparts,  many  Japan  Socialist  Party  candi- 
dates did  not  want  to  run  against  each  other.  But  the  great  majority 
of  the  149  socialist  candidates  who  ran  were  successful,  including 
seven  of  eight  women. 

Doi,  a  university  professor  of  constitutional  law  before  entering 
politics,  had  a  tough,  straight-talking  manner  that  appealed  to  voters 
tired  of  the  evasiveness  of  other  politicians.  Many  women  found 
her  a  refreshing  alternative  to  submissive  female  stereotypes,  and 
in  the  late  1980s  the  public  at  large,  in  opinion  polls,  voted  her 
their  favorite  politician  (the  runner-up  in  these  surveys  was  equally 
tough-talking  conservative  LDP  member  Ishihara  Shintaro).  Doi's 
popularity,  however,  was  of  limited  aid  to  the  party.  The  power- 
ful Shakaishugi  Kyokai  (Japan  Socialist  Association),  which  was 
supported  by  a  hard-core  contingent  of  the  party's  76,000-strong 
membership,  remained  committed  to  doctrinaire  Marxism,  imped- 
ing Doi's  efforts  to  promote  what  she  called perestroika  and  a  more 
moderate  program  with  greater  voter  appeal. 

In  1983  Doi's  predecessor  as  chairman,  Ishibashi  Masashi,  began 
the  delicate  process  of  moving  the  party  away  from  its  strong  op- 
position to  the  Self-Defense  Forces.  While  maintaining  that  these 
forces  were  unconstitutional  in  light  of  Article  9,  he  claimed  that, 
because  they  had  been  established  through  legal  procedures,  they 
had  a  "legitimate"  status  (this  phrasing  was  changed  a  year  later 
to  say  that  the  Self-Defense  Forces  "exist  legally").  Ishibashi  also 
broke  past  precedent  by  visiting  Washington  to  talk  with  United 
States  political  leaders. 

By  the  end  of  the  decade,  the  party  had  accepted  the  Self-Defense 
Forces  and  the  1962  Japan-United  States  Treaty  of  Mutual  Cooper- 
ation and  Security  as  facts  of  life.  It  advocated  strict  limitations 
on  military  spending  (no  more  than  1  percent  of  GNP  annually), 
a  suspension  of  joint  military  exercises  with  United  States  forces, 
and  a  reaffirmation  of  the  "three  nonnuclear  principles"  (no 
production,  possession,  or  introduction  of  nuclear  weapons  into 
Japanese  territory).  Doi  expressed  support  for  "balanced  ties"  with 
the  Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea)  and  the 
Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea).  In  the  past,  the  Japan  Socialist 
Party  had  favored  the  Kim  II  Song  regime  in  P'yongyang,  and  in 


359 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

the  early  1990s  it  still  refused  to  recognize  the  1965  normalization 
of  relations  between  Tokyo  and  Seoul.  In  domestic  policy,  the  party 
demanded  the  continued  protection  of  agriculture  and  small  busi- 
ness in  the  face  of  foreign  pressure,  abolition  of  the  consumer  tax, 
and  an  end  to  the  construction  and  use  of  nuclear  power  reactors. 
As  a  symbolic  gesture  to  reflect  its  new  moderation,  at  its  April 
1990  convention  the  party  dropped  its  commitment  to  "socialist 
revolution"  and  described  its  goal  as  "social  democracy":  crea- 
tion of  a  society  in  which  "all  people  fairly  enjoy  the  fruits  of  tech- 
nological advancement  and  modern  civilization  and  receive  the 
benefits  of  social  welfare."  Delegates  also  voted  Doi  a  third  term 
as  party  chairwoman. 

Because  of  the  party's  self-definition  as  a  class-based  party  and 
its  symbiotic  relationship  with  Sohyo,  the  public  sector  union  con- 
federation, few  efforts  were  made  to  attract  nonunion  constituen- 
cies. Although  some  Sohyo  unions  supported  the  Japan  Communist 
Party,  the  Japan  Socialist  Party  remained  the  representative  of 
Sohyo 's  political  interests  until  the  merger  with  private  sector  unions 
formed  the  noncommunist  Shin  Rengo  in  1989.  Because  of  declin- 
ing union  financial  support  during  the  1980s,  some  Japan  Socialist 
Party  Diet  members  turned  to  dubious  fund-raising  methods.  One 
was  involved  in  the  Recruit  affair.  The  Japan  Socialist  Party,  like 
others,  sold  large  blocks  of  fund-raising  party  tickets,  and  the  LDP 
even  gave  individual  Japan  Socialist  Party  Diet  members  funds 
from  time  to  time  to  persuade  them  to  cooperate  in  passing  difficult 
legislation. 

Komeito 

In  1990,  the  Komeito  (the  euphemistic  English  translation  of  the 
Japanese  name  is  Clean  Government  Party)  was  the  second  larg- 
est opposition  party,  with  forty-five  legislators  in  the  House  of 
Representatives  after  the  February  election,  although  the  party  lost 
eleven  seats  compared  with  its  July  1986  showing.  The  Komeito 
was  an  offshoot  of  the  Soka  Gakkai,  which  had  been  founded  in 
1930  as  an  independent  lay  organization  of  the  Nichiren  Shoshu 
sect  of  Buddhism,  whose  numbers  were  estimated  at  750,000  in 
1958  and  more  than  35  million  in  the  late  1980s.  In  1962  the  Soka 
Gakkai,  established  a  League  for  Clean  Government,  which  be- 
came a  regular  political  party,  the  Komeito,  two  years  later.  Ties 
between  the  Komeito  and  the  Soka  Gakkai  were  formally  dissolved 
in  1970,  and  the  image  of  an  "open  party"  was  projnoted.  But  the 
resignation  in  1989  of  a  Komeito  Diet  member,  Ohashi  Toshio, 
following  his  criticism  of  the  religious  leader  Ikeda  Daisaku,  sug- 
gested that  the  Soka  Gakkai' s  influence  over  the  party  remained 


360 


The  Political  System 


substantial.  Public  suspicions  concerning  the  religious  connection 
(in  principle  a  violation  of  the  Constitution's  Article  20),  and  the 
involvement  of  several  Komeito  Diet  members  in  the  Recruit  scan- 
dal accounted  for  the  party's  poor  electoral  showing  in  February 
1990. 

The  party's  supporters  tended  to  be  people  who  were  largely  out- 
side the  privileged  labor  union  and  "salarymen"  circles  of  lifetime 
employment  in  large  enterprises.  The  Komeito 's  programs  were 
rather  vague.  They  emphasized  welfare  and  quality  of  life  issues. 
In  foreign  policy,  they  had  dropped  their  previous  opposition  to 
the  Japan-United  States  security  treaty  and  the  Self-Defense  Forces. 
Given  the  party's  aversion  to  the  leftism  of  the  Japan  Socialist  Party, 
and  despite  its  occasional  cooperation  with  the  leftists,  it  was  judged 
unlikely  to  enter  into  a  lasting  coalition  with  the  largest  opposition 
group,  despite  protracted  negotiations.  In  fact,  the  LDP  worked 
hard  to  gain  the  Komeito 's  cooperation  in  the  upper  house  to  pass 
legislation,  and  most  commentators  considered  the  Komeito,  along 
with  the  Democratic  Socialist  Party,  as  a  likely  coalition  partner 
should  the  LDP  lose  its  parliamentary  majority  in  the  lower  house. 

Japan  Communist  Party 

The  Japan  Communist  Party  was  first  organized  in  1922,  in  the 
wake  of  the  Russian  Revolution,  and  remained  part  of  the  interna- 
tional, Moscow-controlled  communist  movement  until  the  early 
1960s.  Although  the  party  won  a  large  percentage  of  the  popular 
vote  in  Diet  elections  in  1949,  it  became  extremely  unpopular  after 
1950,  when  Moscow  ordered  it  to  cease  being  a  "lovable  party" 
and  to  engage  in  armed  struggle.  It  was  forced  to  go  underground, 
and  in  the  election  lost  all  its  seats  in  the  Diet.  A  self-reliant  party 
line,  stressing  independence  from  both  Moscow  and  Beijing,  evolved 
during  the  1960s.  The  party's  chairman,  Miyamoto  Kenji,  a  tough 
veteran  of  prewar  struggles  and  wartime  prisons,  promoted  the 
"parliamentary  road"  of  nonviolent,  electoral  politics.  Thereafter, 
the  fortunes  of  the  Japan  Communist  Party  gradually  revived. 
Representation  in  the  lower  house  reached  a  high  point  of  thirty- 
nine  in  the  1979  election,  but  declined  to  between  twenty- six  and 
twenty-nine  seats  in  the  1980s  and  to  sixteen  in  the  February  1990 
election.  The  party's  program  promoted  unarmed  neutrality,  the 
severing  of  security  ties  with  the  United  States,  defense  of  the  post- 
war Constitution,  and  socialism.  It  also  voiced  concern  for  welfare 
and  quality  of  life  issues. 

Both  organizationally  and  financially,  the  party  was  stronger  than 
its  opposition  rivals  and  even  the  LDP.  Revenues  from  its  pub- 
lishing enterprises,  especially  the  popular  newspaper  Akahata  (Red 


361 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


Flag),  which  had  the  eighth  largest  circulation  in  the  country, 
provided  adequate  support  for  its  activities.  As  a  result,  the  Japan 
Communist  Party  was  the  party  least  mired  in  money  politics.  This 
fact  earned  it  the  reluctant  respect  of  voters.  But  suspicions  about 
its  ultimate  intentions  remained  strong  in  the  early  1990s.  It  was 
excluded  from  opposition  party  negotiations  on  coalitions.  Its  loss 
of  ten  seats  in  the  February  1990  general  election  was  partly  the 
result  of  voter  disgust  with  the  party's  Chinese  counterpart  following 
repression  of  prodemocracy  demonstrators  in  Beijing's  Tiananmen 
Incident  in  1989.  In  the  election  campaigns  of  1989-90,  the  LDP 
eagerly  smeared  the  party  with  this  association,  forcing  the  com- 
munists in  their  publicity  to  emphasize  that  the  Chinese  and 
Japanese  parties  were  different  and  that  the  Japanese  party  sin- 
cerely supported  the  struggle  for  democracy  in  China  and  Eastern 
Europe.  Ironically,  the  Japan  Communist  Party  had  strongly  con- 
demned the  Beijing  incident,  while  the  LDP  government,  ever  con- 
scious of  business  interests  with  big  investments  in  China,  had 
reacted  lamely  to  the  killings  by  describing  them  as  4 'regrettable." 

Democratic  Socialist  Party 

The  Democratic  Socialist  Party  was  established  in  January  1960 
when  right-wing  members  of  the  Japan  Socialist  Party  broke  away 
to  form  their  own  group.  In  the  past,  the  Democratic  Socialist  Party 
derived  much  of  its  financial  and  organizational  support  from  the 
Domei  private  sector  labor  confederation.  Like  the  LDP  and  the 
Komeito,  it  supported  the  security  treaty  with  the  United  States 
and  the  Self-Defense  Forces.  As  the  most  conservative  of  the  op- 
position parties,  it  had  formed  coalitions  with  the  LDP  and  viewed 
an  opposition  coalition  with  the  Japan  Socialist  Party  with  distaste. 
In  the  February  1990  general  election,  the  Democratic  Socialist 
Party  won  fourteen  seats,  down  from  the  twenty-six  won  in  the 
July  1986  election.  The  party's  chairman,  Tsukamoto  Saburo,  was 
forced  to  resign  in  1988,  after  it  was  revealed  that  he  received  5,000 
shares  of  stock  from  Recruit. 

Other  Parties  and  Independents 

Like  the  Democratic  Socialist  Party,  the  tiny  Social  Democratic 
League  was  formed,  in  1978,  by  defectors  from  the  Japan  Socialist 
Party.  A  non-Marxist  party  in  the  social  democratic  tradition,  it 
won  four  seats  in  the  February  1990  general  election.  In  February 
1990,  the  Progressive  Party  (Shimpoto)  won  one  seat. 

Largely  to  contest  upper  house  elections,  a  large  number  of '  'mini- 
parties"  had  emerged.  In  the  July  1989  election,  these  included  the 
Salaryman's  New  Party,  which  supported  a  more  equitable  tax 


362 


The  Political  System 


system  for  salaried  workers;  the  Global  Club,  devoted  to  women's 
rights;  the  Pension  Party,  concerned  with  inequities  in  the  national 
pension  system;  and  the  People  Opposed  to  Nuclear  Power  Party. 
The  UFO  Party  advocated  a  government  project  to  make  contact 
with  intelligent  beings  from  outer  space. 

A  relatively  large  number  of  candidates  ran  as  independents  in 
general  elections.  Twenty-one  of  them  were  elected  in  the  Febru- 
ary 1990  balloting,  but  the  majority  later  affiliated  themselves  with 
the  LDP,  as  was  the  custom.  Their  number  has  included  powerful 
former  members  of  the  LDP  such  as  Tanaka  Kakuei  and  Nakasone 
Yasuhiro,  who  had  resigned  from  the  party  because  of  scandals 
but  continued  to  lead  LDP  factions. 

Political  Extremists 

According  to  the  1989  Asahi  Nenkan,  there  were  14,400  activist 
members  of  the  "new  left"  organized  into  five  major  "currents" 
(ryu)  and  27  or  28  different  factions.  Total  membership  was  about 
35,000.  New  left  activity  focused  on  the  New  Tokyo  International 
Airport  at  Narita-Sanrizuka.  In  the  early  1970s,  radical  groups  and 
normally  conservative  farmers  formed  a  highly  unusual  alliance 
to  oppose  expropriation  of  the  latter' s  land  for  the  airport's  con- 
struction. Confrontations  at  the  construction  site,  which  pitted  thou- 
sands of  farmers  and  radicals  against  riot  police,  were  violent  but 
generally  nonlethal.  Although  the  airport  was  completed  and  began 
operations  during  the  1980s,  the  resistance  continued,  on  a  reduced 
scale,  in  the  early  1990s.  Radicals  attempted  to  halt  planned  ex- 
pansion of  the  airport  by  staging  guerrilla  attacks  on  those  directly 
or  indirectly  involved  in  promoting  the  plan.  By  1990,  this  activ- 
ity had  resulted  in  some  deaths.  There  were  also  attacks  against 
places  associated  with  the  emperor.  In  January  1990,  leftists  fired 
homemade  rockets  at  imperial  residences  in  Tokyo  and  Kyoto. 

In  terms  of  terrorist  activities,  the  most  important  new  left  group 
was  the  Japanese  Red  Army  (Nihon  Sekigun).  Formed  in  1969, 
it  was  responsible  for,  among  other  acts,  the  hijacking  of  a  Japan 
Airlines  jet  to  P'yongyang  in  1970  and  the  murder  of  twenty-six 
people  at  Lod  International  Airport  in  Tel  Aviv  in  1977.  Its  ac- 
tivists developed  close  connections  with  international  terrorist 
groups,  including  Palestinian  extremists  (see  Civil  Disturbances, 
ch.  8).  The  Japanese  Red  Army  also  had  close  ties  with  the  Kim 
II  Song  regime  in  North  Korea,  where  several  of  its  hijackers  resided 
during  the  early  1990s.  The  group  was  tightiy  organized,  and  one 
scholar  has  suggested  that  its  "managerial  style"  resembled  that 
of  major  Japanese  corporations.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Right-wing  extremists  were  diverse.  In  1989  there  were  800  such 
groups  with  about  120,000  members  altogether.  By  police  count, 
however,  only  about  50  groups  and  23,000  individuals  were  con- 
sidered active.  Right-wing  extremists  indulged  in  a  heady  roman- 
ticism with  strong  links  to  the  prewar  period.  They  tended  to  be 
fascinated  with  the  macho  charisma  of  blood,  sweat,  and  steel,  and 
promoted  (like  many  nonradical  groups)  traditional  samurai  values 
as  the  antidote  to  the  spiritual  ills  of  postwar  Japan.  Their  prefer- 
ence for  violent  direct  action  rather  than  words  reflected  the  ex- 
ample of  the  militarist  extremists  of  the  1930s  and  the  heroic  "men 
of  strong  will"  of  the  late  Tokugawa  period  of  the  1850s  and  1860s. 
The  modern  right-wing  extremists  demanded  an  end  to  the  post- 
war "system  of  dependence"  on  the  United  States,  restoration  of 
the  emperor  to  his  prewar,  divine  status,  and  repudiation  of  Arti- 
cle 9.  Many,  if  not  most,  right-wingers  had  intimate  connections 
with  Japan's  gangster  underground,  the  yakuza. 

The  ritual  suicide  of  one  of  Japan's  most  prominent  novelists, 
Mishima  Yukio,  following  a  failed  attempt  to  initiate  a  rebellion 
among  Self-Defense  Forces  units  in  November  1970  shocked  and 
fascinated  the  public.  Mishima  and  his  small  private  army,  the 
Shield  Society  (Tate  no  Kai),  hoped  that  a  rising  of  the  Self-Defense 
Forces  would  inspire  a  nationwide  affirmation  of  the  old  values  and 
put  an  end  to  the  postwar  "age  of  languid  peace."  Although  right- 
ists were  also  responsible  for  the  assassination  of  socialist  leader 
Asanuma  Inejiro  in  1960  and  an  attempt  on  the  life  of  former  prime 
minster  Ohira  Masayoshi  in  1978,  most  of  them,  unlike  their  prewar 
counterparts,  largely  kept  to  noisy  street  demonstrations,  especially 
harassment  campaigns  aimed  at  conventions  of  the  leftist  Japan 
Teachers  Union.  In  the  early  1990s,  however,  there  was  evidence 
that  a  "new  right"  was  becoming  more  violent.  In  May  1987,  a 
reporter  working  for  the  liberal  Asahi  Shimbun  was  killed  by  a  gun- 
man belonging  to  the  Nippon  Minzoku  Dokuritsu  Giyugun  Betsudo 
Sekihotai  (Blood  Revenge  Corps  of  the  Partisan  Volunteer  Corps 
for  the  Independence  of  the  Japanese  Race),  known  as  Sekihotai 
(Blood  Revenge  Corps).  The  Sekihotai  also  threatened  to  assas- 
sinate former  Prime  Minister  Nakasone  for  giving  in  to  foreign 
pressure  on  such  issues  as  the  revision  of  textbook  accounts  of 
Japan's  war  record.  In  January  1990,  a  member  of  the  Seikijuku 
(translatable,  ironically,  as  the  Sane  Thinkers  School)  shot  and  seri- 
ously wounded  Nagasaki  mayor  Motoshima  Hitoshi.  The  attack 
may  have  been  provoked  by  the  leftist  rocket  attacks  on  imperial 
residences  in  Tokyo  and  Kyoto  a  few  days  earlier  as  well  as  the 
mayor's  critical  remarks  concerning  Emperor  Hirohito.

The  Political  System 


Despite  the  threat  from  political  extremists  on  both  left  and  right, 
periodic  increases  in  the  strength  of  opposition  parties,  and  fac- 
tionalism and  the  taint  of  scandal  in  its  own  ranks,  the  LDP  con- 
tinued to  maintain  a  strong  government.  In  the  February  1990 
election,  Japan's  economically  stable  citizenry  continued  to  sup- 
port the  government  that  had  ruled  for  nearly  forty  years.

Democratizing  Japan,  a  collection  of  essays  edited  by  Robert  Ward 
and  Sakamoto  Yoshikazu,  describes  the  writing  of  the  postwar  Con- 
stitution and  other  effects  of  the  United  States  occupation  on  Japan's 
political  system.  Theodore  Cohen's  Remaking  Japan,  and  From  a 
Ruined  Empire,  edited  by  Otis  Cary,  depict  the  occupation  from  par- 
ticipants' points  of  view.  Although  most  of  the  essays  in  Maruyama 
Masao's  Thought  and  Behavior  in  Modern  Japanese  Politics  were  com- 
posed in  the  late  1940s  and  early  1950s,  this  volume  still  provides 
perhaps  the  best  discussion  of  Japanese  political  values.  Authority 
and  the  Individual  in  Japan,  edited  by  J.  Victor  Koschmann,  discusses 
changes  in  values  from  the  Meiji  period  to  the  1970s  and  has  many 
interesting  things  to  say  about  how  Japanese  view  authority.  Against 
the  State  by  David  Apter  and  Nagayo  Sawa  challenges  the  conven- 
tional view  of  the  value  placed  on  harmony  (wa)  in  describing  farmer 
and  radical  resistance  to  the  construction  of  the  New  Tokyo  In- 
ternational Airport.  Although  published  in  1969,  Nathaniel  B. 
Thayer's  How  the  Conservatives  Rule  Japan  remained  relevant  in  the 
early  1990s.  More  recent  discussions  of  the  political  system  include 
Bradley  M.  Richardson's  The  Political  Culture  of  Japan,  Kyogoku 
Jun'ichi's  The  Political  Dynamics  of  Japan,  T.J.  Pempel's  Policy  and 
Politics  in  Industrial  States,  and  J.  A.  A.  Stockwin  and  others'  Dynamic 
and  Immobilist  Politics  in  Japan.  Kent  E.  C  alder's  Crisis  and  Compen- 
sation, however,  is  especially  illuminating  because  of  its  avoidance 
of  cultural  explanations  (which  are  typically  overused)  and  its  abun- 
dance of  comparisons  with  other  countries.  B.C.  Koh's  Japan's  Ad- 
ministrative Elite  provides  a  clear  and  concise  discussion  of  the  elite 
civil  service  and  its  policy-making  role.  Karel  G.  van  Wolferen's 
controversial  The  Enigma  of  Japanese  Power,  which  Japanese  critics 
have  called  "a  textbook  for  Japan-bashing,"  is  filled  with  interesting 
details,  even  if  its  main  thesis  about  the  leaderless  nature  of  the 
political  system  is  questionable. 

English-language  journals  and  periodicals  with  useful  articles  on 
the  political  system  include  Journal  of Japanese  Studies,  Journal  of  Asian 
Studies,  Asian  Survey,  Pacific  Affairs  [Vancouver],  Japan  Quarterly

JAPAN'S  FOREIGN  POLICY  was  facing  new  challenges  and 
difficult  decisions  in  1990.  The  1980s  had  seen  enormous  changes 
in  the  distribution  of  international  economic  power  and  the  politi- 
cal influence  that  accompanies  it.  Japan  had  become  the  world's 
largest  creditor  nation  and  the  second  largest  donor  of  foreign  aid. 
Japanese  industries  and  enterprises  were  among  the  most  capable 
in  the  world.  High  savings  and  investment  rates  and  high-quality 
education  were  expected  to  solidify  the  international  leadership  of 
these  enterprises  in  the  decade  to  come.  Its  economic  power  gave 
Japan  a  steadily  growing  role  in  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary), 
the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary),  and  other 
international  financial  institutions.  Investment  and  trade  flows  gave 
Japan  by  far  the  dominant  economic  role  in  Asia,  and  Japanese 
aid  and  investment  were  widely  sought  after  in  other  parts  of  the 
world.  It  appeared  to  be  only  a  matter  of  time  before  such  eco- 
nomic power  would  be  translated  into  greater  political  power. 

The  collapse  of  the  Soviet  domination  of  Eastern  Europe  and 
the  growing  Soviet  preoccupation  with  internal  political  and  eco- 
nomic problems  increased  the  importance  of  economic  competi- 
tion, rather  than  military  power,  to  Japan.  The  Soviet  Union,  a 
military  superpower,  was  often  depicted  as  a  large  Third  World 
country  trying  desperately  to  stave  off  economic  disaster  and  anx- 
iously seeking  aid,  trade,  and  technical  benefits  from  the  developed 
countries,  such  as  Japan.  The  power  of  Japan's  ally,  the  United 
States,  was  also  seen  by  many  as  waning.  The  United  States's  sta- 
tus in  the  1980s  had  gone  from  the  world's  largest  creditor  to  the 
world's  largest  debtor,  and  its  economic  position  had  weakened 
relative  to  some  other  developed  countries,  notably  Japan.  The 
United  States  was  forced  to  look  increasingly  to  Japan  and  others 
to  shoulder  the  financial  burdens  entailed  in  the  transformation 
of  former  communist  economies  in  Eastern  Europe  and  other  ur- 
gent international  requirements  that  fall  upon  the  shoulders  of  world 
leaders. 

Inside  Japan,  both  elite  and  popular  opinion  expressed  grow- 
ing support  for  a  more  prominent  international  role,  proportion- 
ate to  the  nation's  economic  power,  foreign  assistance,  trade,  and 
investment.  But  the  traditional  post- World  War  II  reluctance  to 
take  a  greater  military  role  in  the  world  remained.  A  firm  consen- 
sus continued  to  support  the  1960  Treaty  of  Mutual  Cooperation 
and  Security  and  other  bilateral  agreements  with  the  United  States

as  the  keystones  of  Japan's  security  policy.  However,  Japanese  offi- 
cials were  increasingly  active  in  using  their  economic  and  finan- 
cial resources  in  seeking  a  greater  voice  in  international  financial 
and  political  organizations,  and  in  shaping  the  policies  of  the  de- 
veloped countries  toward  international  trouble  spots,  especially  in 
Asia.  Meanwhile,  there  was  some  doubt  in  both  Japan  and  the 
United  States  as  to  whether  Japan-United  States  security  arrange- 
ments, predicated  on  the  Soviet  threat,  could  be  transformed  to 
meet  the  new  strategic  realities  of  the  1990s. 

Throughout  the  post- World  War  II  period,  Japan  concentrated 
on  economic  growth.  It  accommodated  itself  flexibly  to  the  regional 
and  global  policies  of  the  United  States  while  avoiding  major  in- 
itiatives of  its  own;  adhered  to  pacifist  principles  embodied  in  the 
1947  Constitution,  referred  to  as  the  *  'peace  constitution";  and 
generally  took  a  passive,  low-profile  role  in  world  affairs.  Relations 
with  other  countries  were  governed  by  what  the  leadership  called 
"omnidirectional  diplomacy,"  which  was  essentially  a  policy  of 
maintaining  political  neutrality  in  foreign  affairs  while  expanding 
economic  relations  wherever  possible.  This  policy  was  highly  suc- 
cessful and  allowed  Japan  to  prosper  and  grow  as  an  economic 
power,  but  it  was  feasible  only  while  the  country  enjoyed  the  secu- 
rity and  economic  stability  provided  by  its  ally,  the  United  States. 

The  need  for  a  revamping  of  Japan's  foreign  policy  posture  had 
become  apparent  during  the  1970s  and  particularly  following  the 
middle  of  the  decade,  as  major  changes  in  the  international  situa- 
tion and  the  nation's  own  development  into  an  economic  world 
power  made  the  old  diplomacy  obsolete.  Japan's  burgeoning  eco- 
nomic growth  and  expansion  into  overseas  markets  had  given  rise 
to  foreign  charges  of  "economic  aggression"  and  demands  that 
it  adopt  more  balanced  trade  policies.  Changes  in  the  power  rela- 
tionships in  the  Asia-Pacific  quadrilateral — made  up  of  Japan, 
China,  the  United  States,  and  the  Soviet  Union — also  called  for 
reexamination  of  policies.  The  deepening  Sino-Soviet  split  and  con- 
frontation, the  dramatic  rapprochement  between  the  United  States 
and  China,  the  rapid  reduction  of  the  United  States  military 
presence  in  Asia  following  the  Second  Indochina  War  (1954-75), 
and  the  1970s  expansion  of  Soviet  military  power  in  the  western 
Pacific  all  required  a  reevaluation  of  Japan's  security  position  and 
overall  role  in  Asia.  Finally,  the  oil  crises  of  the  1970s  sharpened 
Japanese  awareness  of  the  country's  vulnerability  to  cutoffs  of  raw 
material  and  energy  supplies,  underscoring  the  need  for  a  less  pas- 
sive, more  independent  foreign  policy. 

Japanese  thinking  on  foreign  policy  was  also  influenced  by  the 
rise  of  a  new  postwar  generation  to  leadership  and  policy-making

positions.  The  differences  in  outlook  between  the  older  leaders  still 
in  positions  of  power  and  influence  and  the  younger  generation 
that  was  replacing  them  complicated  formulation  of  foreign  policy. 

By  1990  Japan's  foreign  policy  choices  often  challenged  the 
leadership's  tendency  to  avoid  radical  shifts  and  to  rely  on  incremen- 
tal adjustments.  Although  still  generally  supportive  of  close  ties, 
including  the  alliance  relationship  with  the  United  States,  Japanese 
leaders  were  well  aware  of  strong  American  frustrations  with 
Japanese  economic  practices  and  Japan's  growing  economic  power 
relative  to  the  United  States  in  world  affairs.  Senior  United  States 
leaders  were  calling  upon  Japanese  officials  to  work  with  them  in 
crafting  4 'a  new  conceptual  framework"  for  Japan-United  States 
relations  that  would  take  account  of  altered  strategic  and  economic 
realities  and  changes  in  Japanese  and  United  States  views  about 
the  bilateral  relationship.  The  results  of  this  effort  were  far  from 
clear.  Some  optimistically  predicted  "a  new  global  partnership" 
in  which  the  United  States  and  Japan  would  work  together  as  truly 
equal  partners  in  dealing  with  global  problems.  Pessimists  predicted 
that  negative  feelings  generated  by  the  realignment  in  United  States 
and  Japanese  economic  power  and  persistent  trade  frictions  would 
prompt  Japan  to  strike  out  more  on  its  own,  without  the  '  'guidance' ' 
of  the  United  States.  Given  the  growing  economic  dominance  of 
Japan  in  Asia,  Tokyo  was  seen  as  most  likely  to  strike  out  indepen- 
dently there  first,  translating  its  economic  power  into  political  and 
perhaps,  eventually,  military  influence. 

Major  Foreign  Policy  Goals  and  Strategies 

Japan's  geography — particularly  its  insular  character,  its  lim- 
ited endowment  of  natural  resources,  and  its  exposed  location  near 
potentially  hostile  giant  neighbors — has  played  an  important  role 
in  the  development  of  its  foreign  policy.  In  premodern  times, 
Japan's  semi-isolated  position  on  the  periphery  of  the  Asian  main- 
land was  an  asset  (see  Physical  Setting,  ch.  2).  It  permitted  the 
Japanese  to  exist  as  a  self-sufficient  society  in  a  secure  environ- 
ment. It  also  allowed  them  to  borrow  selectively  from  the  rich  civili- 
zation of  China  while  maintaining  their  own  cultural  identity. 
Insularity  promoted  a  strong  cultural  and  ethnic  unity,  which  under- 
lay the  early  development  of  a  national  consciousness  that  has  in- 
fluenced Japan's  relations  with  outside  peoples  and  cultures 
throughout  its  history. 

Early  Developments 

In  the  early  sixteenth  century,  a  feudally  organized  Japan  came 
into  contact  with  Western  missionaries  and  traders  for  the  first  time. 


371 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Westerners  introduced  important  cultural  innovations  into  Japanese 
society  during  more  than  a  century  of  relations  with  various  feu- 
dal rulers.  But  when  the  country  was  unified  at  the  beginning  of 
the  seventeenth  century,  the  Tokugawa  government  decided  to 
expel  the  foreign  missionaries  and  strictly  limit  intercourse  with 
the  outside  world.  National  seclusion — except  for  contacts  with  the 
Chinese  and  Dutch — was  Japan's  foreign  policy  for  more  than  two 
centuries  (see  Seclusion  and  Social  Control,  ch.  1). 

When  the  Tokugawa  seclusion  was  forcibly  breached  in  1853- 
54  by  Commodore  Matthew  C.  Perry  of  the  United  States  Navy, 
Japan  found  that  geography  no  longer  ensured  security — the  coun- 
try was  defenseless  against  military  pressures  and  economic  exploi- 
tation by  the  Western  powers.  After  Perry's  naval  squadron  had 
compelled  Japan  to  enter  into  relations  with  the  Western  world, 
the  first  foreign  policy  debate  was  over  whether  Japan  should  em- 
bark on  an  extensive  modernization  to  cope  with  the  threat  of  the 
"eastward  advance  of  Western  power,"  which  had  already  vio- 
lated the  independence  of  China,  or  expel  the  "barbarians"  and 
return  to  seclusion.  The  latter  alternative — although  it  appealed 
to  many — was  never  seriously  considered.  Beginning  with  the  Meiji 
Restoration  of  1868,  which  ushered  in  a  new,  centralized  regime, 
Japan  set  out  to  "gather  wisdom  from  all  over  the  world' '  and  em- 
barked on  an  ambitious  program  of  military,  social,  political,  and 
economic  reforms  that  transformed  it  within  a  generation  into  a 
modern  nation- state  and  major  world  power. 

Modern  Japan's  foreign  policy  was  shaped  at  the  outset  by  its 
need  to  reconcile  its  Asian  identity  with  its  desire  for  status  and 
security  in  an  international  order  dominated  by  the  West.  The  prin- 
cipal foreign  policy  goals  of  the  Meiji  period  (1868-1912)  were  to 
protect  the  integrity  and  independence  of  the  nation  against  Western 
domination  and  to  win  equality  of  status  with  the  leading  nations 
of  the  West  by  reversing  the  unequal  treaties.  Since  fear  of  Western 
military  power  was  the  chief  concern  of  the  Meiji  leaders,  their 
highest  priority  was  building  up  the  basic  requirements  for  national 
defense,  under  the  slogan  "wealth  and  arms"  (Jukoku  kyohei).  They 
saw  that  a  modern  military  establishment  required  national  con- 
scription drawing  manpower  from  an  adequately  educated  popu- 
lation, a  trained  officer  corps,  a  sophisticated  chain  of  command, 
and  strategy  and  tactics  adapted  to  contemporary  conditions  (see 
The  Modernization  of  the  Military,  1868-1931,  ch.  8).  Finally, 
it  required  modern  arms  together  with  the  factories  to  make  them, 
sufficient  wealth  to  purchase  them,  and  a  transportation  system 
to  deliver  them  (see  The  Emergence  of  Modern  Japan,  1868-1919, 
ch.  1).

An  important  objective  of  the  military  buildup  was  to  gain  the 
respect  of  the  Western  powers  and  achieve  equal  status  for  Japan 
in  the  international  community.  Inequality  of  status  was  symbo- 
lized by  the  treaties  imposed  on  Japan  when  the  country  was  first 
opened  to  foreign  intercourse.  The  treaties  were  objectionable  to 
the  Japanese  not  only  because  they  imposed  low  fixed  tariffs  on 


373

foreign  imports  and  thus  handicapped  domestic  industries,  but  also 
because  their  provisions  gave  a  virtual  monopoly  of  external  trade 
to  foreigners  and  granted  extraterritorial  status  to  foreign  nation- 
als in  Japan,  exempting  them  from  Japanese  jurisdiction  and  placing 
Japan  in  the  inferior  category  of  uncivilized  nations.  Many  of  the 
social  and  institutional  reforms  of  the  Meiji  period  were  designed 
to  remove  the  stigma  of  backwardness  and  inferiority  represented 
by  the  "unequal  treaties,"  and  a  major  task  of  Meiji  diplomacy 
was  to  press  for  early  treaty  revision. 

Once  created,  the  Meiji  military  machine  was  used  to  extend 
Japanese  power  overseas,  for  many  leaders  believed  that  national 
security  depended  on  expansion  and  not  merely  a  strong  defense. 
Within  thirty  years,  the  country's  military  forces  had  fought  and 
defeated  imperial  China  in  the  First  Sino-Japanese  War  (1894- 
95),  winning  possession  of  Taiwan  and  Chinese  recognition  of 
Korea's  independence.  Ten  years  later,  in  the  Russo-Japanese  War 
(1904-5),  Japan  defeated  tsarist  Russia  and  won  possession  of 
southern  Sakhalin  as  well  as  a  position  of  paramount  influence  in 
Korea  and  southern  Manchuria.  By  this  time,  Japan  had  been  able 
to  negotiate  revisions  of  the  unequal  treaties  with  the  Western  pow- 
ers and  had  in  1902  formed  an  alliance  with  the  world's  leading 
power,  Britain.  After  World  War  I,  in  which  it  sided  with  the 
Western  Allies,  Japan,  despite  its  relatively  small  role  in  the  war 
(with  little  effort  it  gained  possession  of  former  German  territories 
in  the  Pacific),  sat  with  the  victors  at  Versailles  and  enjoyed  the 
status  of  a  great  power  in  its  own  right. 

Between  World  War  I  and  World  War  II,  the  nation  embarked 
on  a  course  of  imperialist  expansion,  using  both  diplomatic  and 
military  means  to  extend  its  control  over  more  and  more  of  the 
Asian  mainland.  It  began  to  see  itself  as  the  protector  and  cham- 
pion of  Asian  interests  against  the  West,  a  point  of  view  that  brought 
it  increasingly  into  conflict  with  the  Western  powers  (see  Diplomacy, 
ch.  1).  When  its  aggressive  policies  met  firm  resistance  from  the 
United  States  and  its  allies,  Japan  made  common  cause  with  the 
Axis  partnership  of  Germany  and  Italy  and  launched  into  war  with 
the  United  States  and  the  Western  Alliance  (see  World  War  II, 
ch.  8). 

After  Japan's  devastating  defeat  in  World  War  II,  the  nation 
came  under  an  Allied  occupation  in  which  the  United  States,  as 
the  principal  occupying  power,  was  charged  with  the  demilitari- 
zation and  democratization  of  the  state.  Major  changes  were  made 
in  political,  social,  and  economic  institutions  and  practices.  Dur- 
ing the  seven-year  occupation,  the  country  had  no  control  over  its 
foreign  affairs  and  became  in  effect  the  ward  of  the  United  States

on  the  international  scene.  It  adopted  a  new  Constitution  where- 
by, in  Article  9,  the  "Japanese  people  forever  renounce  war  as  a 
sovereign  right  of  the  nation  and  the  threat  or  use  of  force  as  mean 
of  settling  international  disputes"  (see  The  Postwar  Constitution, 
ch.  6). 

Postwar  Developments 

When  Japan  regained  its  sovereignty  in  1952  and  reentered  the 
international  community  as  an  independent  nation,  it  found  itself 
in  a  world  dominated  by  the  Cold  War  between  East  and  West, 
in  which  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  United  States  headed  opposing 
camps.  By  virtue  of  the  Treaty  of  Peace  with  Japan  signed  in  San 
Francisco  on  September  8,  1951  (effective  April  28,  1952),  ending 
the  state  of  war  between  Japan  and  most  of  the  Allied  powers  ex- 
cept the  Soviet  Union  and  China,  and  the  Mutual  Security  As- 
sistance Pact  between  Japan  and  the  United  States,  signed  in  San 
Francisco  the  same  day,  Japan  was  now  essentially  a  dependent 
ally  of  the  United  States,  which  continued  to  maintain  bases  and 
troops  on  Japanese  soil. 

Japan's  foreign  policy  goals  during  most  of  the  early  postwar 
period  were  essentially  to  regain  economic  viability  and  establish 
its  credibility  as  a  peaceful  member  of  the  world  community.  Na- 
tional security  was  entrusted  to  the  protective  shield  and  nuclear 
umbrella  of  the  United  States,  which  was  permitted  under  the  secu- 
rity pact  that  came  into  effect  in  April  1952,  to  deploy  its  forces 
in  and  about  Japan.  The  pact  provided  a  framework  governing 
the  use  of  United  States  forces  against  military  threats — internal 
or  external — in  the  region.  A  special  diplomatic  task  was  to  assuage 
the  suspicions  and  alleviate  the  resentments  of  Asian  neighbors  who 
had  suffered  from  Japanese  colonial  rule  and  imperialist  aggres- 
sion in  the  past.  Japan's  diplomacy  toward  its  Asian  neighbors, 
therefore,  tended  to  be  extremely  low-key,  conciliatory,  and  non- 
assertive.  With  respect  to  the  world  at  large,  the  nation  avoided 
political  issues  and  concentrated  on  economic  goals.  Under  its  omni- 
directional diplomacy,  it  sought  to  cultivate  friendly  ties  with  all 
nations,  proclaimed  a  policy  of  "separation  of  politics  and  eco- 
nomics," and  adhered  to  a  neutral  position  on  some  East- West 
issues. 

During  the  1950s  and  1960s,  foreign  policy  actions  were  guided 
by  three  basic  principles:  close  cooperation  with  the  United  States 
for  both  security  and  economic  reasons;  promotion  of  a  free  trade 
system  congenial  to  Japan's  own  economic  needs;  and  international 
cooperation  through  the  United  Nations  (UN) — to  which  it  was 
admitted  in  1956 — and  other  multilateral  bodies.  Adherence  to  these 


375 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

principles  worked  well  and  contributed  to  phenomenal  economic 
recovery  and  growth  during  the  first  two  decades  after  the  end  of 
the  occupation. 

In  the  1970s,  the  basic  postwar  principles  remained  unchanged, 
but  were  approached  from  a  new  perspective,  owing  to  the  pres- 
sure of  practical  politics  at  home  and  abroad.  There  was  growing 
domestic  pressure  on  the  government  to  exercise  more  foreign  policy 
initiatives  independent  of  the  United  States,  without,  however,  com- 
promising vital  security  and  economic  ties.  The  so-called  Nixon 
''shock,"  involving  the  surprise  United  States  opening  to  China 
and  other  regional  issues,  also  argued  for  a  more  independent 
Japanese  foreign  policy.  The  nation's  phenomenal  economic  growth 
had  made  it  a  ranking  world  economic  power  by  the  early  1970s 
and  had  generated  a  sense  of  pride  and  self-esteem,  especially  among 
the  younger  generation.  The  demand  for  a  more  independent  for- 
eign policy  reflected  this  enhanced  self-image. 

Changes  in  world  economic  relations  during  the  1970s  also  en- 
couraged a  more  independent  stance.  Japan  had  become  less  de- 
pendent on  the  Western  powers  for  resources.  Oil,  for  example, 
was  obtained  directly  from  the  producing  countries  and  not  from 
the  Western-controlled  multinational  companies.  Other  important 
materials  also  came  increasingly  from  sources  other  than  the  United 
States  and  its  allies,  while  trade  with  the  United  States  as  a  share 
of  total  trade  dropped  significantly  during  the  decade  of  the  1970s. 
Thus,  political  leaders  began  to  argue  that  in  the  interests  of  eco- 
nomic self-preservation,  more  attention  should  be  paid  to  the  finan- 
cial and  development  needs  of  other  countries,  especially  those  that 
provided  Japan  with  vital  energy  and  raw  material  supplies. 

The  move  toward  a  more  autonomous  foreign  policy  was  ac- 
celerated in  the  1970s  by  the  United  States  decision  to  withdraw 
troops  from  Indochina.  Japanese  public  opinion  had  earlier  favored 
some  distance  between  Japan  and  the  United  States  involvement 
in  war  in  Vietnam.  The  collapse  of  the  war  effort  in  Vietnam  was 
seen  as  the  end  of  United  States  military  and  economic  dominance 
in  Asia  and  brought  to  the  fore  a  marked  shift  in  Japanese  atti- 
tudes about  the  United  States.  This  shift,  which  had  been  developing 
since  the  early  1970s,  took  the  form  of  questioning  the  credibility 
of  the  United  States 's  nuclear  umbrella,  as  well  as  its  ability  to  under- 
write a  stable  international  currency  system,  guarantee  Japanese 
access  to  energy  and  raw  materials,  and  secure  Japanese  interests 
in  a  stable  political  order.  The  shift  therefore  required  a  reassess- 
ment of  omnidirectional  diplomacy. 

Japan's  leaders  welcomed  the  reassertion  of  United  States  mili- 
tary power  in  Asian  and  world  affairs  following  the  revolution  in

Foreign  Relations 


Iran,  the  United  States  hostage  crisis,  and  the  Soviet  military  in- 
vasion of  Afghanistan,  all  of  which  occurred  in  1979.  Japanese  lead- 
ers played  a  strong  supporting  role  in  curbing  economic  and  other 
interaction  with  the  Soviet  Union  and  its  allies,  to  help  check  the 
expansion  of  Soviet  power  in  sensitive  Third  World  areas.  Under 
Prime  Minister  Nakasone  Yasuhiro,  Japan  built  up  a  close  political- 
military  relationship  with  the  United  States  as  part  of  a  de  facto 
international  front  of  a  number  of  developed  and  developing  coun- 
tries intent  on  checking  Soviet  expansion.  Japan's  defense  spend- 
ing continued  to  grow  steadily  despite  overall  Japanese  budget 
restraint.  Japan  became  increasingly  active  in  granting  foreign  as- 
sistance to  countries  of  strategic  importance  in  East-West  compe- 
tition (see  Strategic  Considerations;  Defense  Spending,  ch.  8). 

The  realignment  of  United  States  and  Japanese  currencies  in 
the  mid-1980s  increased  the  growth  of  Japanese  trade,  aid,  and 
investment,  especially  in  Asia.  It  also  accelerated  the  reversal  of 
the  United  States  fiscal  position,  from  one  of  the  world's  largest 
creditors  in  the  early  1980s  to  the  world's  largest  debtor  at  the  end 
of  the  decade.  Japan  became  the  world's  largest  creditor,  an  in- 
creasingly active  investor  in  the  United  States,  and  a  major  con- 
tributor to  international  debt  relief,  financial  institutions,  and  other 
assistance  efforts. 

The  crucial  issue  for  the  United  States  and  many  other  world 
governments  in  the  1990s  centered  on  how  Japan  would  employ 
this  growing  economic  power.  The  strategic  framework  of  the 
Japan-United  States  alliance  also  was  called  into  question  by  the 
ending  of  the  Cold  War  and  collapse  of  the  Soviet  empire.  Could 
a  new  rationale  be  found  to  sustain  the  active  security  tie  that  had 
been  the  basis  for  Japan's  foreign  affairs  in  the  postwar  period? 
Had  Japan's  foreign  interactions  become  so  broad  and  multifaceted 
that  new  mechanisms  were  needed?  Were  new  ways  of  thinking 
about  Japan's  foreign  policy  being  formulated  and  implemented 
in  Japan?  It  appeared  clear  to  observers  in  Japan  in  1990  that  the 
majority  of  the  Japanese  public  and  elite  were  satisfied  with  the 
general  direction  of  Japanese  foreign  policy.  That  policy  direction 
was  characterized  by  continued  close  ties  with  the  United  States, 
to  sustain  world  stability  and  prosperity  that  were  so  beneficial  to 
Japan,  and  incrementally  more  assertive  Japanese  policies,  espe- 
cially regarding  international  economic  and  political  institutions 
and  Asian  affairs.  Yet,  the  world  order  was  changing  rapidly,  and 
there  were  deep  frustrations  in  some  quarters  in  the  United  States, 
China,  and  Western  Europe  over  Japanese  practices.  There  also 
was  some  evidence  of  deep  frustrations  in  Japan  over  Tokyo's  seem- 
ing slowness  in  taking  a  more  active  world  role.  The  possibility

of  more  radical  change  in  Japanese  foreign  policy,  perhaps  in  direc- 
tions more  independent  of  the  United  States,  remained  a  distinct 
possibility. 

Foreign  Policy  Formulation 
Institutional  Framework 

Under  the  1947  Constitution,  the  cabinet  exercises  the  primary 
responsibility  for  the  conduct  of  foreign  affairs,  subject  to  the  overall 
supervision  of  the  Diet  (see  The  Legislature,  ch.  6).  The  prime 
minister  is  required  to  make  periodic  reports  on  foreign  relations 
to  the  Diet,  whose  upper  and  lower  houses  each  have  a  foreign  af- 
fairs committee.  Each  committee  reports  on  its  deliberations  to  ple- 
nary sessions  of  the  chamber  to  which  it  belongs.  Ad  hoc  committees 
are  formed  occasionally  to  consider  special  questions.  Diet  mem- 
bers have  the  right  to  raise  pertinent  policy  questions — officially 
termed  interpellations — to  the  minister  of  foreign  affairs  and  the 
prime  minister.  Treaties  with  foreign  countries  require  ratification 
by  the  Diet.  As  the  symbol  of  the  state,  the  emperor  performs  the 
ceremonial  function  of  receiving  foreign  envoys  and  attesting  to 
foreign  treaties  ratified  by  the  Diet. 

As  the  chief  executive  and  constitutionally  the  dominant  figure 
in  the  political  system,  the  prime  minister  has  the  final  word  in 
major  foreign  policy  decisions.  The  minister  of  foreign  affairs,  a 
senior  member  of  the  cabinet,  acts  as  the  prime  minister's  chief 
adviser  in  matters  of  planning  and  implementation.  The  minister 
in  1990  was  assisted  by  two  vice  ministers:  one  in  charge  of  ad- 
ministration, who  was  at  the  apex  of  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Af- 
fairs structure  as  its  senior  career  official,  and  the  other  in  charge 
of  political  liaison  with  the  Diet.  Other  key  positions  in  the  minis- 
try included  members  of  the  ministry's  Secretariat  which  in  1989 
had  divisions  handling  consular,  emigration,  communications,  and 
cultural  exchange  functions,  and  the  directors  of  the  various  regional 
and  functional  bureaus  in  the  ministry  (see  fig.  10). 

The  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  staff  included  an  elite  career 
foreign  service  corps,  recruited  on  the  basis  of  a  competitive  ex- 
amination and  thereafter  trained  by  the  ministry's  Foreign  Ser- 
vice Training  Institute.  The  handling  of  specific  foreign  policy  issues 
was  usually  divided  between  the  geographic  and  functional  bureaus 
to  minimize  overlaps  and  competition.  In  general,  bilateral  issues 
were  assigned  to  the  geographic  bureaus,  and  multilateral  problems 
to  the  functional  bureaus.  The  Treaties  Bureau,  with  its  wide- 
ranging  responsibilities,  tended  to  get  involved  in  the  whole  spec- 
trum of  issues.  The  Information  Analysis,  Research,  and  Planning

Bureau  in  the  ministry's  Secretariat  engaged  in  comprehensive  and 
coordinated  policy  investigation  and  planning. 

Long  a  profession  of  high  social  prestige,  diplomatic  service  from 
the  Meiji  period  through  World  War  II  was  a  preserve  of  the  upper 
social  strata.  In  addition  to  formal  qualifications,  proper  social  ori- 
gin, family  connections,  and  graduation  from  Tokyo  Imperial 
University  were  important  prewar  requirements  for  admission. 
After  World  War  II,  these  requirements  were  changed  as  part  of 
democratic  reform  measures  but  foreign  service  continued  to  be 
a  highly  regarded  career.  Most  career  foreign  service  officers  had 
passed  the  postwar  Higher  Foreign  Service  Examination  before 
entry  into  the  service.  Many  of  these  successful  examinees  were 
graduates  of  the  prestigious  Law  Faculty  of  the  University  of  Tokyo. 
Almost  all  ambassadorial  appointments  since  the  1950s  have  been 
made  from  among  veteran  diplomats. 

Diplomacy  in  postwar  Japan  was  not  a  monopoly  of  the  Minis- 
try of  Foreign  Affairs.  Given  the  overriding  importance  of  economic 
factors  in  foreign  relations,  the  ministry  worked  closely  with  the 
Ministry  of  Finance  on  matters  of  customs,  tariffs,  international 
finance,  and  foreign  aid;  with  the  Ministry  of  International  Trade 
and  Industry  (MITI)  on  exports  and  imports;  and  with  the  Ministry 
of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries  on  questions  of  foreign 
agricultural  imports  and  fishing  rights.  The  Ministry  of  Foreign 
Affairs  also  consulted  other  agencies,  such  as  the  Defense  Agency, 
the  Fair  Trade  Commission,  the  Japan  Export-Import  Bank,  the 
Japan  External  Trade  Organization,  the  Overseas  Economic  Co- 
operation Fund,  and  the  Overseas  Technical  Cooperation  Agency. 
On  many  issues  affecting  the  country's  foreign  economic  activi- 
ties— and  thus  its  diplomatic  relations  as  well — the  Ministry  of  For- 
eign Affairs  and  sometimes  MITI  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  were 
known  to  favor  liberalizing  import  restrictions.  On  the  other  hand, 
the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries  and  other 
domestic  ministries  took  a  more  protectionist  stand,  evidently  be- 
cause of  pressures  from  special  interest  groups  (see  Trade  and  In- 
vestment Institutions,  ch.  5). 

The  vital  importance  of  foreign  affairs  expanded  to  affect  virtu- 
ally every  aspect  of  national  life  in  postwar  Japan,  and  the  multi- 
plicity of  agencies  involved  in  external  affairs  continued  to  be  a 
source  of  confusion  and  inefficiency  in  the  formulation  of  foreign 
policy.  On  the  other  hand,  as  the  postwar  generation  of  leaders 
and  policymakers  began  to  assume  a  greater  role  in  government 
decision  making  and  as  public  attitudes  on  foreign  policy  issues 
matured,  there  were  indications  that  foreign  affairs  were  being  con- 
ducted on  the  basis  of  a  more  stable  consensus.

Foreign  Relations 


The  Role  of  Domestic  Politics 

The  influence  of  Japanese  domestic  politics  on  the  conduct  of 
foreign  affairs  changed  in  the  mid-1970s.  Up  to  that  time,  the  for- 
eign policy  debate  in  Japan  had  been  between  "progressives,"  who 
favored  advances  toward  socialist  countries  and  more  independence 
from  the  United  States,  and  "conservatives,"  who  tended  to  identify 
Japanese  interests  closely  with  the  United  States-led  alignment  of 
Western  countries.  The  ruling  Liberal  Democratic  Party  (LDP) 
was  closely  associated  with  the  conservative,  pro-United  States  po- 
sition, while  opposition  parties  often  staked  out  positions  at  odds 
with  the  status  quo  (see  The  Liberal  Democratic  Party,  ch.  6). 

General  satisfaction  in  Japan  with  the  peace  and  prosperity  that 
had  been  brought  to  the  country  made  it  hard  for  opposition  par- 
ties to  garner  much  support  for  a  radical  move  to  the  left  in  Japan's 
foreign  policy.  The  collapse  of  communism  in  Eastern  Europe  and 
the  widely  publicized  brutalities  of  communist  regimes  in  Asia  in 
the  late  1980s  further  dampened  popular  Japanese  interest  in  shift- 
ing foreign  policy  to  the  left. 

Meanwhile,  the  ruling  LDP  modified  its  base  of  political  power. 
By  the  1980s,  it  had  markedly  shifted  the  social  composition  of  LDP 
support  away  from  the  traditional  conservative  reliance  on  busi- 
ness and  rural  groups,  to  include  every  category  of  the  electorate. 
This  shift  resulted  from  efforts  by  LDP  politicians  to  align  various 
local  interests  in  mutually  advantageous  arrangements  in  support 
of  LDP  candidates.  The  LDP  had  brought  together  various  can- 
didates and  their  supporting  interest  groups  and  had  reached  a  pol- 
icy consensus  to  pursue  economic  development  while  depending 
strongly  on  the  United  States  security  umbrella. 

Domestic  political  challenges  to  LDP  dominance  waxed  and 
waned  later  in  the  1980s  as  the  party  faced  major  influence-peddling 
scandals  with  weak  and  divided  leadership.  In  1989  the  opposi- 
tion Japan  Socialist  Party  won  control  of  the  Diet's  House  of  Coun- 
cillors. But  the  Japan  Socialist  Party's  past  ideological  positions 
on  foreign  policy  appeared  to  be  more  of  a  liability  than  an  asset 
going  into  the  lower- house  elections  in  1990,  and  the  party  at- 
tempted to  modify  a  number  of  positions  that  called  for  pushing 
foreign  policy  to  the  left.  In  contrast,  the  LDP  standard  bearer, 
Prime  Minister  Kaifu  Toshiki,  used  identification  with  the  United 
States  and  the  West  to  his  advantage  in  the  successful  LDP  effort 
to  sustain  control  of  the  House  of  Representatives  in  February  1990 
(see  The  Electoral  System,  ch.  6). 

In  1990  the  government,  under  the  LDP,  continued  to  popula- 
rize its  policy  of  economic  and  security  ties  with  the  United  States; 
of  responding  to  domestic  and  international  expectations  of  greater 


381 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Japanese  political  and  economic  contributions;  and  of  international 
cooperation  through  the  UN  and  other  international  organizations 
in  the  cause  of  world  peace,  disarmament,  aid  to  developing  coun- 
tries, and  educational  and  technical  cooperation.  Foreign  policy 
speeches  by  the  prime  minister  and  the  minister  of  foreign  affairs 
were  widely  disseminated,  and  pamphlets  and  booklets  on  major 
foreign  policy  questions  were  issued  frequently. 

Political  groups  opposing  the  government's  foreign  policy 
presented  their  views  freely  through  political  parties  and  the  mass 
media,  which  took  vocal  and  independent  positions  on  wide-ranging 
external  issues.  Some  of  the  opposing  elements  were  leftists  who 
sought  to  exert  influence  through  their  representatives  in  the  Diet, 
through  mass  organizations,  and  sometimes  through  rallies  and 
street  demonstrations.  In  contrast,  special  interest  groups  supporting 
the  government — including  the  business  community  and  agricul- 
tural interests — brought  pressure  to  bear  on  the  prime  minister, 
cabinet  members,  and  members  of  the  Diet,  usually  through  behind- 
the-scenes  negotiations  and  compromises  (see  Interest  Groups;  The 
Mass  Media  and  Politics,  ch.  6). 

Partisan  political  activities  of  all  ideological  tendencies  were 
undertaken  freely  and  openly,  but  the  difference  in  foreign  policy 
perspectives  appeared  increasingly  in  the  1980s  to  derive  less  from 
ideology  than  from  more  pragmatic  considerations.  Broadly  stated, 
the  partisan  disagreement  among  the  various  groups  competing 
for  power  had  centered  on  the  question  of  Japan's  safety  from  ex- 
ternal threat  or  attack.  The  dominant  view  was  that,  although  the 
Japanese  should  be  responsible  for  defending  their  homeland,  they 
should  continue  their  security  ties  with  the  United  States,  at  least 
until  they  could  gain  sufficient  confidence  in  their  own  self-defense 
power,  which  has  been  interpreted  as  not  being  proscribed  by  Ar- 
ticle 9  of  the  Constitution.  Proponents  of  this  view  agreed  that  this 
self-defense  capability  should  be  based  on  conventional  arms  and 
that  any  nuclear  shield  should  be  provided  by  the  United  States 
under  the  1960  security  treaty. 

The  Sino-United  States  rapprochement  of  the  1970s  and  the 
stiffening  of  Japan-Soviet  relations  in  the  1980s  caused  the  oppo- 
sition parties  to  be  less  insistent  on  the  need  to  terminate  the  secu- 
rity treaty.  The  Democratic  Socialist  Party  and  the  Komeito  (Clean 
Government  Party)  indicated  their  readiness  to  support  the  treaty, 
while  the  Japan  Socialist  Party  dropped  its  demand  for  immediate 
abrogation.  Only  the  Japan  Communist  Party  remained  adamant. 

Despite  partisan  differences,  all  political  parties  and  groups  were 
nearly  unanimous  during  the  1970s  and  1980s  that  Japan  should 
exercise  more  independence  and  initiative  in  foreign  affairs  and 


382 


Foreign  Relations 


not  appear  so  ready  to  follow  the  United  States  on  matters  affect- 
ing Japan's  interests.  They  also  agreed  that  Japan  should  continue 
to  prohibit  the  introduction  of  nuclear  weapons  into  the  country. 
These  shared  views  stemmed  from  the  resurgence  of  nationalism 
during  the  post- World  War  II  era  and  from  Japanese  people's  pride 
in  their  own  heritage  and  in  the  economic  achievements  of  the  post- 
war decades.  Although  there  were  indications  that  the  "nuclear 
allergy"  produced  by  Japan's  traumatic  experience  with  the  atomic 
bombings  of  Hiroshima  and  Nagasaki  in  August  1945  was  begin- 
ning to  moderate,  nuclear  weapons  remained  a  sensitive  political 
issue  in  1990. 

Except  for  security-related  matters,  most  foreign  affairs  issues 
involved  economic  interests  and  mainly  attracted  the  attention  of 
the  specific  groups  affected.  The  role  of  interest  groups  in  formulat- 
ing foreign  policy  varied  with  the  issue  at  hand.  Because  trade  and 
capital  investment  issues  were  involved,  for  example,  in  relations 
with  China  and  with  the  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea),  the 
business  community  increasingly  became  an  interested  party  in  the 
conduct  of  foreign  affairs.  Similarly,  when  fishing  rights  or  agricul- 
tural imports  were  being  negotiated,  representatives  of  the  indus- 
tries affected  worked  with  political  leaders  and  the  foreign  affairs 
bureaucracies  in  shaping  policy. 

Because  of  the  continuous  control  of  the  government  enjoyed 
by  the  LDP  since  its  formation  in  1955,  the  policy-making  bodies 
of  the  LDP  had  become  the  centers  of  government  policy  formu- 
lation. Because  the  unified  will  of  the  majority  party  almost  in- 
variably prevailed  in  the  Diet,  some  observers  believed  that  that 
body,  had  been  reduced  to  a  mere  sounding  board  for  government 
policy  pronouncements  and  a  rubber-stamp  ratifier  of  decisions 
made  by  the  prime  minister  and  his  cabinet.  This  situation  meant 
that  significant  debate  and  deliberations  on  foreign  policy  matters 
generally  took  place  not  in  the  Diet  but  in  closed-door  meetings 
of  the  governing  LDP,  for  example,  between  representatives  of  the 
Foreign  Affairs  Section  of  the  LDP's  Policy  Research  Council  and 
officials  of  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  MITI,  or  leaders  of 
major  LDP  support  groups,  such  as  the  Federation  of  Economic 
Organizations  (Keizai  Dantai  Rengokai — better  known  as  Keidan- 
ren;  see  Business  Interests,  ch.  6). 

The  role  of  public  opinion  in  the  formulation  of  foreign  policy 
throughout  the  postwar  period  has  been  difficult  to  determine.  Japan 
continued  to  be  extremely  concerned  with  public  opinion,  and  opin- 
ion polling  became  a  conspicuous  feature  of  national  life.  The  large 
number  of  polls  on  public  policy  issues,  including  foreign  pol- 
icy matters,  conducted  by  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  the 


383 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  other  government  organizations,  and 
the  media  led  to  the  presumption  by  analysts  that  the  collective 
opinions  of  voters  do  exert  significant  influence  on  policymakers. 
The  public  attitudes  toward  foreign  policy  that  had  held  through- 
out much  of  the  postwar  period  appeared  to  have  shifted  in  the 
1980s.  Opinion  polls  reflected  a  marked  increase  in  national  pride 
and  self-esteem.  Moreover,  public  discussion  of  security  matters 
by  government  officials,  political  party  leaders,  press  commenta- 
tors, and  academics  had  become  markedly  less  volatile  and  doc- 
trinaire and  more  open  and  pragmatic,  suggesting  indirectly  that 
public  attitudes  on  this  subject  had  evolved  as  well. 

The  mass  media,  and  particularly  the  press,  as  the  champion 
of  the  public  interest  and  critic  of  the  government,  continued  to 
mold  public  attitudes  strongly.  The  media  was  the  chief  source  of 
demands  that  the  government  exercise  a  more  independent  and 
less  "weak-kneed"  diplomacy  in  view  of  the  changing  world  situ- 
ation and  Japan's  increased  stature  in  the  world. 

An  Overview  of  Japan's  Foreign  Relations 

Relations  with  the  United  States 

Japan-United  States  relations  were  more  uncertain  in  1 990  than 
at  any  time  since  World  War  II.  As  long-standing  military  allies 
and  increasingly  interdependent  economic  partners,  Japan  and  the 
United  States  cooperated  closely  to  build  a  strong,  multifaceted 
relationship  based  on  democratic  values  and  interests  in  world  sta- 
bility and  development.  Japan-United  States  relations  improved 
enormously  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  as  the  two  societies  and  econ- 
omies became  increasingly  intertwined.  In  1990  their  combined 
gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  totaled  about  one  third 
of  the  world's  GNP.  Japan  received  about  11  percent  of  United 
States  exports  (a  larger  share  than  any  other  country  except  Can- 
ada), and  the  United  States  bought  about  34  percent  of  Japan's 
exports  (see  United  States  and  Canada,  ch.  5).  Japan  had  US$65 
billion  in  direct  investment  in  the  United  States  in  1990,  while  the 
United  States  had  more  than  US$17  billion  invested  in  Japan.  Some 
US$100  billion  in  United  States  government  securities  held  by  in- 
stitutions in  Japan  helped  finance  much  of  the  United  States  budget 
deficit.  Economic  exchanges  were  reinforced  by  a  variety  of  scien- 
tific, technical,  tourist,  and  other  exchanges.  Each  society  continued 
to  see  the  other  as  its  main  ally  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  Certain 
developments  in  the  late  1980s  damaged  bilateral  relations.  Never- 
theless, public  opinion  surveys  continued  to  reveal  that  substan- 
tial majorities  of  Japanese  and  Americans  believed  that  the  bilateral 
relationship  was  vital  to  both  countries. 


384 


Foreign  Relations 


Growing  interdependence  was  accompanied  by  markedly  chang- 
ing circumstances  at  home  and  abroad  that  were  widely  seen  to 
have  created  a  crisis  in  Japan-United  States  relations  in  the  late 
1980s.  United  States  government  officials  continued  to  emphasize 
the  positive  aspects  of  the  relationship  but  warned  that  there  was 
a  need  for  ' 4  a  new  conceptual  framework. "  The  Wall  Street  Journal 
publicized  a  series  of  lengthy  reports  documenting  changes  in  the 
relationship  in  the  late  1980s  and  reviewing  the  considerable  de- 
bate in  Japan  and  the  United  States  over  whether  a  closely  co- 
operative relationship  was  possible  or  appropriate  for  the  1990s. 
An  authoritative  review  of  popular  and  media  opinion,  published 
in  1990  by  the  Washington-based  Commission  on  US-Japan  Re- 
lations for  the  Twenty  First  Century,  was  concerned  with  preserving 
a  close  Japan-United  States  relationship.  It  warned  of  a  "new  ortho- 
doxy" of  "suspicion,  criticism  and  considerable  self-justification," 
which  it  said  was  endangering  the  fabric  of  Japan-United  States 
relations. 

Three  sets  of  factors  stood  out  as  most  important  in  explaining 
the  challenges  facing  Japan-United  States  relations  in  the  1990s. 
They  were  economic,  political-military,  and  domestic  in  nature. 

The  relative  economic  power  of  Japan  and  the  United  States  was 
undergoing  sweeping  change,  especially  in  the  1980s.  This  change 
went  well  beyond  the  implications  of  the  United  States  trade  deficit 
with  Japan,  which  had  remained  between  US$40  billion  and  US$48 
billion  annually  since  the  mid-1980s.  The  persisting  United  States 
trade  and  budget  deficits  of  the  early  1980s  led  to  a  series  of  deci- 
sions in  the  middle  of  the  decade  that  brought  a  major  realignment 
of  the  value  of  Japanese  and  United  States  currencies.  The  stronger 
Japanese  currency  gave  Japan  the  ability  to  purchase  more  United 
States  goods  and  to  make  important  investments  in  the  United 
States.  By  the  late  1980s,  Japan  was  the  main  international  creditor. 

Japan's  growing  investment  in  the  United  States — it  was  the  sec- 
ond largest  investor  after  Britain — led  to  complaints  from  some 
American  constituencies.  Moreover,  Japanese  industry  seemed  well 
positioned  to  use  its  economic  power  to  invest  in  the  high-technology 
products  in  which  United  States  manufacturers  were  still  leaders. 
The  United  States' s  ability  to  compete  under  these  circumstances 
was  seen  by  many  Japanese  and  Americans  as  hampered  by  heavy 
personal,  government,  and  business  debt  and  a  low  savings  rate. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  breakup  of  the  Soviet  bloc  in  Eastern  Eu- 
rope and  the  growing  preoccupation  of  Soviet  leaders  with  mas- 
sive internal  political  and  economic  difficulties  forced  the  Japanese 
and  United  States  governments  to  reassess  their  longstanding  alli- 
ance against  the  Soviet  threat.  Officials  of  both  nations  had  tended 


385 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

to  characterize  the  security  alliance  as  the  linchpin  of  the  relation- 
ship, which  should  have  priority  over  economic  and  other  disputes. 
Some  Japanese  and  United  States  officials  and  commentators  con- 
tinued to  emphasize  the  common  dangers  to  Japan-United  States 
interests  posed  by  the  continued  strong  Soviet  military  presence 
in  Asia  (see  Relations  with  the  Soviet  Union,  this  ch.).  They  stressed 
that  until  Moscow  followed  its  moderation  in  Europe  with  major 
demobilization  and  reductions  in  its  forces  positioned  against  the 
United  States  and  Japan  in  the  Pacific,  Washington  and  Tokyo 
needed  to  remain  militarily  prepared  and  vigilant. 

Increasingly,  however,  other  perceived  benefits  of  close  Japan- 
United  States  security  ties  were  emphasized.  The  alliance  was  seen 
as  deterring  other  potentially  disruptive  forces  in  East  Asia,  nota- 
bly the  Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea  (North  Korea). 
Ironically,  some  United  States  officials  noted  that  the  alliance  helped 
keep  Japan's  potential  military  power  in  check  and  under  the  su- 
pervision of  the  United  States. 

The  post-Cold  War  environment  strengthened  the  relative  im- 
portance of  economic  prowess  over  military  power  as  the  major 
source  of  world  influence  in  the  1990s.  This  shift  affected  the  per- 
ceived relative  standing  of  Japan,  the  United  States,  and  other  pow- 
ers. Increasingly,  Japan  was  expected  to  shoulder  international  aid 
and  economic  responsibilities  that  in  the  past  were  discharged  by 
the  United  States  and  other  Western  countries. 

The  declining  Soviet  threat,  the  rising  power  of  the  Japanese 
economy,  increasingly  close  United  States  interaction  (and  related 
disputes)  with  Japan,  and  other  factors  led  by  1990  to  a  decided 
shift  in  United  States  opinion  about  Japan,  and  less  marked  but 
nonetheless  notable  shifts  in  Japanese  opinion.  In  the  United  States, 
this  shift  was  reflected  in  questions  about  which  was  the  more  seri- 
ous, the  military  threat  from  the  Soviets  or  the  economic  challenge 
from  Japan.  In  a  series  of  polls  in  1989  and  1990,  most  respon- 
dents considered  the  challenge  from  Japan  the  more  serious.  Sim- 
ilarly, poll  data  from  early  1990  showed  that  most  Japanese 
considered  negative  United  States  attitudes  toward  Japan  a  re- 
flection of  United  States  anger  at  "America's  slipping  economic 
position."  Meanwhile,  Japanese  opinion  was  showing  greater  con- 
fidence in  Japan's  ability  to  handle  its  own  affairs  without  con- 
stant reference — as  in  the  past — to  the  United  States.  Japanese  belief 
in  United  States  reliability  as  a  world  leader  also  lessened. 

In  both  countries,  new  or  "revisionist"  views  of  the  Japan-United 
States  relationship  were  promoted.  In  Japan,  some  commentators 
argued  that  the  United  States  was  weak,  dependent  on  Japan,  and 
unable  to  come  to  terms  with  world  economic  competition.  They 


386 


Foreign  Relations 


urged  Japan  to  strike  out  on  a  more  independent  course.  In  the 
United  States,  prominent  commentators  warned  of  a  Japanese  eco- 
nomic juggernaut,  out  of  control  of  the  Japanese  government,  which 
needed  to  be  "contained"  by  the  United  States. 

At  the  same  time,  it  was  easy  to  overstate  the  changes  in  opin- 
ion in  both  countries.  Japanese  still  considered  the  United  States 
positively  as  their  closest  friend,  the  principal  guardian  of  their  ex- 
ternal security,  their  most  important  economic  partner  and  mar- 
ket, and  the  exemplar  of  a  life- style  that  had  much  to  offer — and 
much  to  envy.  Moreover,  the  vast  majority  of  Americans  still  viewed 
Japan  positively,  had  high  respect  for  Japanese  accomplishments, 
and  supported  the  United  States  defense  commitment  to  Japan. 

In  the  years  after  World  War  II,  Japan's  relations  with  the  United 
States  were  placed  on  an  equal  footing  for  the  first  time  at  the  end 
of  the  occupation  by  the  Allied  forces  in  April  1952.  This  equal- 
ity, the  legal  basis  of  which  was  laid  down  in  the  peace  treaty  signed 
by  forty-eight  Allied  nations  and  Japan,  was  initially  largely  nomi- 
nal, because  in  the  early  postoccupation  period  Japan  required 
direct  United  States  economic  assistance.  A  favorable  Japanese 
balance  of  payments  with  the  United  States  was  achieved  in  1954, 
mainly  as  a  result  of  United  States  military  and  aid  spending  in 
Japan. 

The  Japanese  people's  feeling  of  dependence  lessened  gradually 
as  the  disastrous  results  of  World  War  II  subsided  into  the  back- 
ground and  trade  with  the  United  States  expanded.  Self-confidence 
grew  as  the  country  applied  its  resources  and  organizational  skill 
to  regaining  economic  health.  This  situation  gave  rise  to  a  general 
desire  for  greater  independence  from  United  States  influence.  Dur- 
ing the  1950s  and  1960s,  this  feeling  was  especially  evident  in  the 
Japanese  attitude  toward  United  States  military  bases  on  the  four 
main  islands  of  Japan  and  in  Okinawa  Prefecture,  occupying  the 
southern  two-thirds  of  the  Ryukyu  Islands  (see  fig.  1). 

The  government  had  to  balance  left-wing  pressure  advocating 
disassociation  from  the  United  States  against  the  realities  of  the 
need  for  military  protection.  Recognizing  the  popular  desire  for 
the  return  of  the  Ryukyus  and  the  Bonin  Islands  (also  known  as 
the  Ogasawara  Islands),  the  United  States  as  early  as  1953  volun- 
tarily relinquished  its  control  of  the  Amami  Island  group  at  the 
northern  end  of  the  Ryukyus.  But  the  United  States  made  no  com- 
mitment to  return  Okinawa,  which  was  then  under  United  States 
military  administration  for  an  indefinite  period  as  provided  in  Ar- 
ticle 3  of  the  peace  treaty.  Popular  agitation  culminated  in  a  unani- 
mous resolution  adopted  by  the  Diet  in  June  1956,  calling  for  a 
return  of  Okinawa  to  Japan. 


387 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Bilateral  talks  on  revising  the  1952  security  pact  began  in  1959, 
and  the  new  Treaty  of  Mutual  Cooperation  and  Security  was  signed 
in  Washington  on  January  19,  1960.  When  the  pact  was  submit- 
ted to  the  Diet  for  ratification  on  February  5,  it  became  the  sub- 
ject of  bitter  debate  over  the  Japan-United  States  relationship  and 
the  occasion  for  violence  in  an  all-out  effort  by  the  leftist  opposi- 
tion to  prevent  its  passage.  It  was  finally  approved  by  the  House 
of  Representatives  on  May  20.  Japan  Socialist  Party  deputies  boy- 
cotted the  lower  house  session  and  tried  to  prevent  the  LDP  deputies 
from  entering  the  chamber;  they  were  forcibly  removed  by  the 
police.  Massive  demonstrations  and  rioting  by  students  and  trade 
unions  followed.  These  outbursts  prevented  a  scheduled  visit  to 
Japan  by  President  Dwight  D.  Eisenhower  and  precipitated  the 
resignation  of  Prime  Minister  Kishi  Nobusuke,  but  not  before  the 
treaty  was  passed  by  default  on  June  19,  when  the  House  of  Coun- 
cillors failed  to  vote  on  the  issue  within  the  required  thirty  days 
after  lower  house  approval. 

Under  the  treaty,  both  parties  assumed  an  obligation  to  assist 
each  other  in  case  of  armed  attack  on  territories  under  Japanese 
administration.  (It  was  understood,  however,  that  Japan  could  not 
come  to  the  defense  of  the  United  States  because  it  was  constitu- 
tionally forbidden  to  send  armed  forces  overseas.  In  particular,  the 
Constitution  forbids  the  maintenance  of  ''land,  sea,  and  air  forces." 
It  also  expresses  the  Japanese  people's  renunciation  of  "the  threat 
or  use  of  force  as  a  means  of  settling  international  disputes."  Ac- 
cordingly, the  Japanese  find  it  difficult  to  send  their  "self-defense" 
forces  overseas,  even  for  peace-keeping  purposes.)  The  scope  of 
the  new  treaty  did  not  extend  to  the  Ryukyu  Islands,  but  an  ap- 
pended minute  made  clear  that  in  case  of  an  armed  attack  on  the 
islands,  both  governments  would  consult  and  take  appropriate 
action.  Notes  accompanying  the  treaty  provided  for  prior  consul- 
tation between  the  two  governments  before  any  major  change  oc- 
curred in  the  deployment  of  United  States  troops  or  equipment 
in  Japan.  Unlike  the  1952  security  pact,  the  new  treaty  provided 
for  a  ten-year  term,  after  which  it  could  be  revoked  upon  one  year's 
notice  by  either  party.  The  treaty  included  general  provisions  on 
the  further  development  of  international  cooperation  and  on  im- 
proved future  economic  cooperation. 

Both  countries  worked  closely  to  fulfill  the  United  States  promise, 
under  Article  3  of  the  peace  treaty,  to  return  all  Japanese  territo- 
ries acquired  by  the  United  States  in  war.  In  June  1968  the  United 
States  returned  the  Bonin  Islands  (including  I  wo  Jima)  to  Japanese 
administrative  control.  In  1969  the  Okinawa  reversion  issue  and 
Japan's  security  ties  with  the  United  States  became  the  focal  points 


388 


Foreign  Relations 


of  partisan  political  campaigns.  The  situation  calmed  considera- 
bly when  Prime  Minister  Sato  Eisaku  visited  Washington  in 
November  1969,  and  in  a  joint  communique  signed  by  him  and 
President  Richard  M.  Nixon,  announced  the  United  States  agree- 
ment to  return  Okinawa  to  Japan  in  1972.  In  June  1971,  after  eigh- 
teen months  of  negotiations,  the  two  countries  signed  an  agreement 
providing  for  the  return  of  Okinawa  to  Japan  in  1972. 

The  Japanese  government's  firm  and  voluntary  endorsement  of 
the  security  treaty  and  the  settlement  of  the  Okinawa  reversion  ques- 
tion meant  that,  two  major  political  issues  in  Japan-United  States 
relations  were  eliminated.  But  new  issues  arose.  In  July  1971,  the 
Japanese  government  was  surprised  by  Nixon's  dramatic  announce- 
ment of  his  forthcoming  visit  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China. 
Many  Japanese  were  chagrined  by  the  failure  of  the  United  States 
to  consult  in  advance  with  Japan  before  making  such  a  fundamental 
change  in  foreign  policy.  The  following  month,  the  government 
was  again  surprised  to  learn  that,  without  prior  consultation,  the 
United  States  had  imposed  a  10  percent  surcharge  on  imports,  a 
decision  certain  to  hinder  Japan's  exports  to  the  United  States.  Re- 
lations between  Tokyo  and  Washington  were  further  strained  by 
the  monetary  crisis  involving  the  December  1971  revaluation  of 
the  Japanese  yen  (for  value  of  the  yen — see  Glossary). 

These  events  of  1971  marked  the  beginning  of  a  new  stage  in 
relations,  a  period  of  adjustment  to  a  changing  world  situation  that 
was  not  without  episodes  of  strain  in  both  political  and  economic 
spheres,  although  the  basic  relationship  remained  close.  The  po- 
litical issues  between  the  two  countries  were  essentially  security- 
related  and  derived  from  efforts  by  the  United  States  to  induce 
Japan  to  contribute  more  to  its  own  defense  and  to  regional  secu- 
rity. The  economic  issues  tended  to  stem  from  the  ever- widening 
United  States  trade  and  payments  deficits  with  Japan,  which  began 
in  1965  when  Japan  reversed  its  imbalance  in  trade  with  the  United 
States  and,  for  the  first  time,  achieved  an  export  surplus. 

The  United  States  withdrawal  from  Indochina  in  1975  and  the 
end  of  the  Second  Indochina  War  meant  that  the  question  of  Japan's 
role  in  the  security  of  East  Asia  and  its  contributions  to  its  own 
defense  became  central  topics  in  the  dialogue  between  the  two  coun- 
tries. United  States  dissatisfaction  with  Japanese  defense  efforts 
began  to  surface  in  1975  when  Secretary  of  Defense  James  A. 
Schlesinger  publicly  stigmatized  Japan  as  a  passive  defense  partner. 

United  States  pressures  continued  and  intensified,  particularly 
as  events  in  Iran  and  elsewhere  in  the  Middle  East  after  1979  caused 
the  United  States  to  relocate  more  than  50  percent  of  its  naval 
strength  from  East  Asian  waters  to  the  Indian  Ocean.  Japan  was 


389 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


repeatedly  pressed  not  only  to  increase  its  defense  expenditures  and 
build  up  its  antisubmarine  and  naval  patrol  capabilities,  but  to  play 
a  more  active  and  positive  security  role  generally. 

The  Japanese  government,  constrained  by  constitutional  limi- 
tations and  strongly  pacifist  public  opinion,  responded  slowly  to 
pressures  for  a  more  rapid  buildup  of  its  Self-Defense  Forces  (SDF). 
It  steadily  increased  its  budgetary  outlays  for  those  forces,  however, 
and  indicated  its  willingness  to  shoulder  more  of  the  cost  of  main- 
taining the  United  States  military  bases  in  Japan.  In  1976  the 
United  States  and  Japan  formally  established  a  subcommittee  for 
defense  cooperation,  in  the  framework  of  a  bilateral  Security  Con- 
sultative Committee  provided  for  under  the  1960  security  treaty. 
This  subcommittee,  in  turn,  drew  up  new  Guidelines  for  Japan- 
United  States  Defense  Cooperation,  under  which  military  plan- 
ners of  the  two  countries  have  conducted  studies  relating  to  joint 
military  action  in  the  event  of  an  armed  attack  on  Japan. 

On  the  economic  front,  Japan  sought  to  ease  trade  frictions  by 
agreeing  to  Orderly  Marketing  Arrangements,  which  limited 
exports  on  products  whose  influx  into  the  United  States  was  creat- 
ing political  problems.  In  1977  an  Orderly  Marketing  Arrange- 
ment limiting  Japanese  color  television  exports  to  the  United  States 
was  signed,  following  the  pattern  of  an  earlier  disposition  of  the 
textile  problem.  Steel  exports  to  the  United  States  were  also  cur- 
tailed, but  the  problems  continued  as  disputes  flared  over  United 
States  restrictions  on  Japanese  development  of  nuclear  fuel- 
reprocessing  facilities,  Japanese  restrictions  on  certain  agricultur- 
al imports,  such  as  beef  and  oranges,  and  liberalization  of  capital 
investment  and  government  procurement  within  Japan. 

To  respond  to  the  call,  from  its  allies  and  from  within  the  coun- 
try as  well,  for  a  greater  and  more  responsible  role  in  the  world, 
Japan  developed  what  Ohira  Masayoshi,  after  he  became  prime 
minister  in  December  1978,  called  a  "comprehensive  security  and 
defense  strategy  to  safeguard  peace."  Under  this  policy,  Japan 
sought  to  place  its  relations  with  the  United  States  on  a  new 
footing — one  of  close  cooperation  but  on  a  more  reciprocal  and 
autonomous  basis,  and  on  a  global  scale. 

This  policy  was  put  to  the  test  in  November  1979,  when  radical 
Iranians  seized  the  United  States  embassy  in  Tehran,  taking  sixty 
hostages.  Japan  reacted  by  condemning  the  action  as  a  violation 
of  international  law.  At  the  same  time,  Japanese  trading  firms  and 
oil  companies  reportedly  purchased  Iranian  oil  that  had  become 
available  when  the  United  States  banned  oil  imported  from  Iran. 
This  action  brought  sharp  criticism  from  the  United  States  of 
Japanese  government  "insensitivity"  for  allowing  the  oil  purchases 


390 


Foreign  Relations 


and  led  to  a  Japanese  apology  and  agreement  to  participate  in  sanc- 
tions against  Iran  in  concert  with  other  United  States  allies. 

Following  that  incident,  the  Japanese  government  took  greater 
care  to  support  United  States  international  policies  designed  to 
preserve  stability  and  promote  prosperity.  Japan  was  prompt  and 
effective  in  announcing  and  implementing  sanctions  against  the 
Soviet  Union  following  the  Soviet  invasion  of  Afghanistan  in  De- 
cember 1979.  In  1981,  in  response  to  United  States  requests,  it 
accepted  greater  responsibility  for  defense  of  seas  around  Japan, 
pledged  greater  support  for  United  States  forces  in  Japan,  and  per- 
sisted with  a  steady  buildup  of  the  SDF. 

A  qualitatively  new  stage  of  Japan-United  States  cooperation  in 
world  affairs  appeared  to  be  reached  in  late  1982  with  the  election 
of  Prime  Minister  Nakasone  Yasuhiro.  Officials  of  the  Ronald  Rea- 
gan administration  worked  closely  with  their  Japanese  counterparts 
to  develop  a  personal  relationship  between  the  two  leaders  based 
on  their  common  security  and  international  outlook.  Nakasone  re- 
assured United  States  leaders  of  Japan's  determination  against  the 
Soviet  threat,  closely  coordinated  policies  with  the  United  States 
toward  such  Asian  trouble  spots  as  the  Korean  Peninsula  and 
Southeast  Asia,  and  worked  cooperatively  with  the  United  States 
in  developing  China  policy.  The  Japanese  government  welcomed 
the  increase  of  United  States  forces  in  Japan  and  the  Western  Pa- 
cific, continued  the  steady  buildup  of  the  SDF,  and  positioned  Japan 
firmly  on  the  side  of  the  United  States  against  the  threat  of  Soviet 
international  expansion.  Japan  continued  to  cooperate  closely  with 
United  States  policy  in  these  areas  following  Nakasone 's  term  of 
office,  although  the  political  leadership  scandals  in  Japan  in  the 
late  1980s  made  it  difficult  for  newly  elected  President  George  Bush 
to  establish  the  same  kind  of  close  personal  ties  that  marked  the 
Reagan  years. 

A  specific  example  of  Japan's  close  cooperation  with  the  United 
States  included  its  quick  response  to  the  United  States  call  for  greater 
host  nation  support  from  Japan  following  the  rapid  realignment 
of  Japan-United  States  currencies  in  the  mid-1980s.  The  currency 
realignment  resulted  in  a  rapid  rise  of  United  States  costs  in  Japan, 
which  the  Japanese  government,  upon  United  States  request,  was 
willing  to  offset.  Another  set  of  examples  was  provided  by  Japan's 
willingness  to  respond  to  United  States  requests  for  foreign  as- 
sistance to  countries  considered  of  strategic  importance  to  the  West. 
During  the  1980s,  United  States  officials  voiced  appreciation  for 
Japan's  "strategic  aid"  to  countries  such  as  Pakistan,  Turkey, 
Egypt,  and  Jamaica.  Prime  Minister  Kaifu  Toshiki's  pledges  of 
support  for  East  European  and  Middle  Eastern  countries  in  1 990 


391 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

fit  the  pattern  of  Japan's  willingness  to  share  greater  responsibil- 
ity for  world  stability. 

Despite  complaints  from  some  Japanese  businesses  and  diplo- 
mats, the  Japanese  government  remained  in  basic  agreement  with 
United  States  policy  toward  China  and  Indochina.  The  govern- 
ment held  back  from  large-scale  aid  efforts  until  conditions  in  China 
and  Indochina  were  seen  as  more  compatible  with  Japanese  and 
United  States  interests.  Of  course,  there  also  were  instances  of  lim- 
ited Japanese  cooperation.  Japan's  response  to  the  United  States 
decision  to  help  to  protect  tankers  in  the  Persian  Gulf  during  the 
Iran-Iraq  war  in  the  late  1980s  was  subject  to  mixed  reviews.  Some 
United  States  officials  stressed  the  positive,  noting  that  Japan  was 
unable  to  send  military  forces  because  of  constitutional  reasons  but 
compensated  by  supporting  the  construction  of  a  navigation  sys- 
tem in  the  Gulf,  providing  greater  host  nation  support  for  United 
States  forces  in  Japan,  and  providing  loans  to  Oman  and  Jordan 
(see  The  Article  9  "No  War"  Clause,  ch.  6).  Japan's  refusal  to 
join  even  in  a  mine-sweeping  effort  in  the  Gulf  was  an  indication 
to  some  United  States  officials  of  Tokyo's  unwillingness  to  cooperate 
with  the  United  States  in  areas  of  sensitivity  to  Japanese  leaders 
at  home  or  abroad. 

The  main  area  of  noncooperation  with  the  United  States  in  the 
1980s  was  Japanese  resistance  to  repeated  United  States  efforts  to 
get  Japan  to  open  its  market  more  to  foreign  goods  and  to  change 
other  economic  practices  seen  as  adverse  to  United  States  economic 
interests.  A  common  pattern  was  followed  here.  The  Japanese 
government  was  sensitive  to  political  pressures  from  important 
domestic  constituencies  that  would  be  hurt  by  greater  openness. 
In  general,  these  constituencies  were  of  two  types — those  repre- 
senting inefficient  or  "declining"  producers,  manufacturers,  and 
distributors,  who  could  not  compete  if  faced  with  full  foreign  com- 
petition; and  those  up-and-coming  industries  that  the  Japanese 
government  wished  to  protect  from  foreign  competition  until  they 
could  compete  effectively  on  world  markets.  To  deal  with  domes- 
tic pressures  while  trying  to  avoid  a  break  with  the  United  States, 
the  Japanese  government  engaged  in  protracted  negotiations.  This 
tactic  bought  time  for  declining  industries  to  restructure  themselves 
and  new  industries  to  grow  stronger.  Agreements  reached  dealt 
with  some  aspects  of  the  problems,  but  it  was  common  for  trade 
or  economic  issues  to  be  dragged  out  in  talks  over  several  years, 
involving  more  than  one  market-opening  agreement.  Such  agree- 
ments were  sometimes  vague  and  subject  to  conflicting  interpre- 
tations in  Japan  and  the  United  States  (see  Import  Policies,  ch.  5). 


392 


Foreign  Relations 


During  the  1970s  and  1980s,  United  States  administrations  had 
favored  an  issue-by-issue  approach  in  negotiating  such  economic 
disputes  with  Japan.  This  approach  ostensibly  limited  the  areas 
of  dispute.  But  it  resulted  in  widespread  negative  publicity,  at  a 
time  when  changing  economic  and  security  circumstances  were 
causing  both  countries  to  reevaluate  the  relationship.  Notable  out- 
pourings of  United  States  congressional  and  media  rhetoric  criti- 
cal of  Japan  accompanied  the  disclosure  in  1987  that  Toshiba  had 
illegally  sold  sophisticated  machinery  of  United  States  origin  to  the 
Soviet  Union,  which  reportedly  allowed  Moscow  to  make  subma- 
rines quiet  enough  to  avoid  United  States  detection,  and  the  United 
States  congressional  debate  in  1989  over  the  Japan-United  States 
agreement  to  develop  a  new  fighter  aircraft — the  FSX — for  Japan's 
Air  Self-Defense  Force  (see  The  Defense  Industry,  ch.  8). 

A  new  approach  was  added  in  1989.  The  so-called  Structural 
Impediments  Initiative  was  a  series  of  talks  designed  to  deal  with 
domestic  structural  problems  limiting  trade  on  both  sides.  After 
several  rounds  of  often  contentious  talks,  agreements  were  reached 
in  April  and  July  1990  that  promised  major  changes  in  such  sensi- 
tive areas  as  Japanese  retailing  practices,  land  use,  and  investment 
in  public  works.  The  United  States  pledged  to  deal  more  effectively 
with  its  budget  deficit  and  to  increase  domestic  savings.  United 
States  supporters  saw  the  Structural  Impediments  Initiative  talks 
as  addressing  fundamental  causes  of  Japan-United  States  economic 
friction.  Skeptics  pointed  to  them  as  ways  for  officials  to  buy  time 
and  avoid  an  acute  crisis  in  Japan-United  States  relations. 

Relations  with  China 

The  priority  that  policy  toward  China  has  commanded  in 
Japanese  foreign  affairs  has  varied  over  time.  During  the  period 
of  United  States-backed  "containment"  of  China,  there  was  a  sharp 
divergence  between  official  policy  and  popular  attitudes  in  Japan. 
As  a  loyal  ally  of  the  United  States,  the  Japanese  government  was 
committed  to  nonrecognition,  whereas  popular  sentiments  favored 
diplomatic  relations  and  expanded  trade.  The  Japan  Communist 
Party  and  the  Japan  Socialist  Party  sought  to  capitalize  on  this  sit- 
uation in  their  propaganda  efforts  to  promote  closer  relations  with 
Beijing.  Pro-Chinese  sentiment  found  support  not  only  in  the  desire 
of  the  business  community  for  a  new  source  of  raw  materials  and 
a  profitable  market,  but  also  in  the  popular  feeling  of  cultural  af- 
finity with  the  Chinese.  Japanese  leaders  spent  considerable  effort 
trying  to  manage  this  tension. 

The  unanticipated  United  States  opening  to  China  in  1971  under- 
mined the  administration  of  Prime  Minister  Sato,  but  the  subse- 
quent government  of  Prime  Minister  Tanaka  Kakuei  quickly

adjusted  policy  by  normalizing  diplomatic  relations  in  1972. 
Throughout  the  next  decade,  policy  toward  China  continued  to 
receive  high  priority  as  Japanese  officials  dealt  with  competing  pres- 
sures from  the  Chinese  and  Soviet  governments.  Beijing  and 
Moscow  pressed  Tokyo  to  side  with  their  respective  positions  in 
the  intense  Sino- Soviet  competition  for  influence  in  Asia  follow- 
ing the  substantial  United  States  military  withdrawal  and  the  fall 
of  United  States-backed  regimes  in  Indochina. 

China's  economic  importance  to  Japanese  policymakers  rose  in 
tandem  with  the  market-oriented  reforms  and  increased  foreign 
interaction  associated  with  the  post-Mao  Zedong  policies  of  Chinese 
leader  Deng  Xiaoping.  Unrealistic  Japanese  expectations  of  eco- 
nomic benefit  in  China  were  ended  by  the  zigzag  course  of  Chinese 
development  in  the  1980s.  Japanese  decision  makers  by  the  end 
of  the  decade  were  able  to  settle  on  a  balanced  policy  toward  China 
that  required  less  attention  from  Japanese  leaders  and  received  lower 
priority  than  in  the  past.  The  massacre  of  prodemocracy  demon- 
strators in  Beijing's  Tiananmen  Incident  and  collapse  of  communist 
regimes  in  Eastern  Europe  and  parts  of  Asia  in  1989  discredited 
China's  communist  leaders  in  the  minds  of  Japanese  people  and 
made  it  more  difficult  for  Chinese  officials  or  opposition  Japanese 
politicians  to  raise  China-related  issues  in  Japanese  domestic  poli- 
tics. The  effect  was  to  reduce  further  the  need  to  make  special 
government  concessions  on  China-related  issues. 

The  early  post-World  War  II  political  differences  between  the 
two  countries  related  especially  to  China's  insistence  that  Japan 
end  its  official  relations  with  the  Guomindang  (Chinese  Nation- 
alist Party)  government  on  Taiwan  and  abrogate  its  security  treaty 
with  the  United  States.  Initially,  neither  country  allowed  its  polit- 
ical differences  to  stand  in  the  way  of  broadening  unofficial  con- 
tacts, and  in  the  mid-1950s  they  exchanged  an  increasing  number 
of  cultural,  labor,  and  business  delegations. 

In  1958,  however,  China  suspended  its  trade  with  Japan — ap- 
parentiy  convinced  that  trade  concessions  were  ineffective  in  achiev- 
ing political  goals.  Thereafter,  in  a  plan  for  improving  political 
relations,  China  requested  that  the  Japanese  government  not  be 
hostile  toward  it,  not  obstruct  any  effort  to  restore  normal  rela- 
tions between  itself  and  Japan,  and  not  join  in  any  conspiracy  to 
create  two  Chinas. 

Coincident  with  its  dispute  with  the  Soviet  Union,  China  resumed 
its  trade  with  Japan  in  late  1960.  Important  provisions  were  at- 
tached to  the  arrangement,  however,  stipulating  that  trade  was  to 
be  based  on  formal  government-to-government  agreements  and 
private  trade  was  to  be  sanctioned  indirectly  by  the  Japanese

Foreign  Relations 


government.  Only  Japanese  firms  that  pledged  to  support  the  three 
political  principles  of  1958  were  to  be  allowed  to  participate. 

In  November  1962,  Sino-Japanese  relations  were  elevated  to 
semiofficial  status — still  far  short  of  diplomatic  recognition — with 
the  signing  in  Beijing  of  a  five-year  trade  memorandum  (1963-67), 
better  known  as  the  Liao-Takasaki  Agreement.  Under  its  terms, 
Chinese  purchases  of  industrial  plants  were  to  be  financed  partly 
through  medium-term  credits  from  the  Japan  Export-Import  Bank. 
The  accord  also  permitted  China  to  open  a  trade  mission  in  Tokyo 
and  in  1963  paved  the  way  for  Japanese  government  approval  of 
the  export  to  China  of  a  synthetic  textile  manufacturing  plant  valued 
at  around  US$20  million,  guaranteed  by  the  bank.  Subsequent  pro- 
test from  Taiwan  caused  Japan  to  shelve  further  deferred-payment 
plant  exports.  China  reacted  to  this  change  by  downgrading  its 
Japan  trade  and  intensified  propaganda  attacks  against  Japan  as 
a  4 'lackey"  of  the  United  States. 

Relations  cooled  noticeably  during  the  massive  political  and  eco- 
nomic chaos  that  prevailed  during  the  radical  phases  of  the  Cul- 
tural Revolution  in  China,  from  1966  to  1969.  As  the  turmoil 
subsided,  however,  the  Japanese  government — -already  under  pres- 
sure both  from  the  pro-China  factions  in  the  LDP  and  from  oppo- 
sition elements — sought  to  adopt  a  more  forward  posture.  Japan's 
efforts  to  set  its  own  China  policy  became  particularly  evident  after 
July  1971  when  Nixon,  according  to  Japanese  sources,  ''shocked" 
the  Japanese  by  announcing  his  forthcoming  visit  to  Beijing.  Re- 
lations remained  complicated,  however,  because  of  Japan's  diplo- 
matic and  substantial  economic  ties  with  Taiwan  and  the  presence 
of  a  powerful  pro-Guomindang  faction  in  the  LDP. 

The  September  1972  visit  to  Beijing  of  Japan's  newly  elected 
prime  minister,  Tanaka  Kakuei,  culminated  in  the  signing  of  a 
historic  joint  statement  that  ended  nearly  eighty  years  of  enmity 
and  friction  between  the  two  countries.  In  this  statement,  Tokyo 
recognized  the  Beijing  regime  as  the  sole  legal  government  of  China, 
stating  at  the  same  time  that  it  understood  and  respected  China's 
position  that  Taiwan  was  "an  inalienable  part  of  the  territory  of 
the  People's  Republic  of  China."  For  its  part,  China  waived  its 
demand  for  war  indemnities  from  Japan.  (This  demand  was  first 
made  in  the  mid-1950s;  the  war  reparations  claims  totaled  as  much 
as  the  equivalent  of  US$50  billion.)  Diplomatic  relations  were  to 
be  established  as  of  September  29,  1972.  Japan  and  China  also 
agreed  to  hold  negotiations  aimed  at  the  conclusion  not  only  of  a 
treaty  of  peace  and  friendship  but  also  at  agreements  on  trade,  ship- 
ping, air  transportation,  and  fisheries.  Sino-Japanese  trade  grew 
rapidly  after  1972.  In  January  1974,  a  three-year  trade  agreement — 


395 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

the  first  of  several  working  agreements  covering  civil  air  transpor- 
tation, shipping,  fisheries,  and  trademarks — was  signed.  Arrange- 
ments for  technical  cooperation,  cultural  exchange,  and  consular 
matters  were  also  undertaken. 

Negotiations  for  a  Sino-Japanese  peace  and  friendship  treaty  also 
began  in  1974  but  soon  encountered  a  political  problem  Japan 
wished  to  avoid.  China  insisted  on  including  in  the  treaty  an 
antihegemony  clause,  clearly  directed  at  the  Soviet  Union.  Japan, 
wishing  to  adhere  to  its  "equidistant"  or  neutral  stance  in  the  Sino- 
Soviet  confrontation,  objected.  The  Soviet  Union  made  clear  that 
a  Sino-Japanese  treaty  would  prejudice  Soviet-Japanese  relations. 
Japanese  efforts  to  reach  a  compromise  with  China  over  this  issue 
failed,  and  the  talks  were  broken  off  in  September  1975. 

Matters  remained  at  a  standstill  until  political  changes  in  China 
after  the  death  of  Mao  Zedong  in  1976  brought  to  the  fore  a  leader- 
ship dedicated  to  economic  modernization  and  interested  in  accom- 
modation with  Japan,  whose  aid  was  essential.  A  changing  climate 
of  opinion  in  Japan  that  was  more  willing  to  ignore  Soviet  warn- 
ings and  protests  and  accept  the  idea  of  "antihegemonism"  as  an 
international  principle  also  helped  lay  the  groundwork  for  new  ef- 
forts to  conclude  the  treaty. 

In  February  1978,  a  long-term  private  trade  agreement  led  to 
an  arrangement  by  which  trade  between  Japan  and  China  would 
increase  to  a  level  of  US$20  billion  by  1985,  through  exports  from 
Japan  of  plants  and  equipment,  technology,  construction  materials, 
and  machine  parts  in  return  for  coal  and  crude  oil.  This  long-term 
plan,  which  gave  rise  to  inflated  expectations,  proved  overly  am- 
bitious and  was  drastically  cut  back  the  following  year  as  China 
was  forced  to  reorder  its  development  priorities  and  scale  down 
its  commitments.  However,  the  signing  of  the  agreement  reflected 
the  wish  on  both  sides  to  improve  relations.  In  April  1978,  a  dis- 
pute involving  the  intrusion  of  armed  Chinese  fishing  boats  into 
the  waters  off  the  Senkaku  Islands,  a  cluster  of  barren  islets  north 
of  Taiwan  and  south  of  the  Ryukyu  Islands,  flared  up  and  threat- 
ened to  disrupt  the  developing  momentum  toward  a  resumption 
of  peace  treaty  talks.  Restraint  on  both  sides  led  to  an  amic- 
able resolution.  (The  Senkakus  are  claimed  by  Japan,  China,  and 
Taiwan,  but  the  question  of  territorial  rights  was  finessed  in  this 
case.)  Talks  on  the  peace  treaty  were  resumed  in  July,  and  agree- 
ment was  reached  in  August  on  a  compromise  version  of  the  anti- 
hegemony  clause.  The  Treaty  of  Peace  and  Friendship  was  signed 
on  August  12  and  came  into  effect  October  23,  1978. 

Chinese  domestic  political  problems  and  uneven  progress  in 
China's  reform  programs  at  times  dampened  Japanese  enthusiasm

Foreign  Relations 


for  economic  relations  with  China.  Yet  Sino-Japanese  relations 
made  considerable  progress  in  the  1980s.  In  1982  there  was  a  seri- 
ous political  controversy  over  revision  of  Japanese  textbooks  deal- 
ing with  the  history  of  imperial  Japan's  war  against  China  in  the 
1930s  and  1940s.  Beijing  also  registered  concern  in  1983  about  the 
reported  shift  in  United  States  strategic  emphasis  in  Asia,  away 
from  China  and  in  favor  of  more  reliance  on  Japan,  under  the 
leadership  of  the  more  *  'hawkish"  Prime  Minister  Nakasone 
Yasuhiro,  warning  anew  against  possible  revival  of  Japanese 
militarism.  By  mid- 1983,  however,  Beijing  had  decided — coinci- 
dentally  with  its  decision  to  improve  relations  with  the  Reagan 
administration — to  solidify  ties  with  Japan.  Chinese  Communist 
Party  general  secretary  Hu  Yaobang  visited  Japan  in  November 
1983,  and  Prime  Minister  Nakasone  reciprocated  by  visiting  China 
in  March  1984. 

The  Chinese  had  long  looked  on  Japan — by  then  a  major  trad- 
ing partner — as  a  leading  source  of  assistance  in  promoting  eco- 
nomic development  in  China.  The  growth  of  Soviet  military  power 
in  East  Asia  in  the  early  1980s  prompted  them  to  consult  with  Japan 
more  frequently  on  security  issues  and  to  pursue  parallel  foreign 
policies  designed  to  check  Soviet  influence  and  promote  regional 
stability.  While  Japanese  enthusiasm  for  the  Chinese  market  waxed 
and  waned,  broad  strategic  considerations  in  the  1980s  steadied 
Tokyo's  policy  toward  Beijing.  In  fact,  Japan's  heavy  involvement 
in  China's  economic  modernization  reflected  in  part  a  determina- 
tion to  encourage  peaceful  domestic  development  in  China,  to  draw 
China  into  gradually  expanding  links  with  Japan  and  the  West, 
to  reduce  China's  interest  in  returning  to  its  more  provocative  for- 
eign policies  of  the  past,  and  to  obstruct  any  Sino- Soviet  realign- 
ment against  Japan. 

Thus,  common  strategic  concerns,  as  well  as  economic  interests, 
held  the  two  nations  together.  Until  the  late  1970s,  the  Chinese 
appeared  more  alarmed  than  Japan  about  the  Soviet  military  build- 
up in  Asia.  But  as  Moscow  increasingly  sought  to  impede  stra- 
tegic cooperation  among  Japan,  the  United  States,  and  possibly 
China,  in  part  by  stepped-up  intimidation  of  Japan,  the  Nakasone 
government  became  more  concerned  about  the  Soviet  military 
buildup. 

Many  of  Tokyo's  concerns  about  the  Soviet  Union  duplicated 
Chinese  worries.  They  included  the  increased  deployment  in  East 
Asia  of  Soviet  SS-20  missiles,  Tu-22M  Backfire  bombers,  and  bal- 
listic missile  submarines;  the  growth  of  the  Soviet  Pacific  fleet;  the 
Soviet  invasion  of  Afghanistan  and  the  potential  threat  it  posed 


397 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

to  Persian  Gulf  oil  supply  routes;  and  an  increased  Soviet  military 
presence  in  Vietnam. 

In  response,  Japan  and  China  adopted  strikingly  complemen- 
tary foreign  policies,  designed  to  isolate  the  Soviet  Union  and  its 
allies  politically  and  to  promote  regional  stability.  In  Southeast  Asia, 
both  countries  provided  strong  diplomatic  backing  for  the  efforts 
of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN — see  Glos- 
sary) to  bring  about  a  Vietnamese  withdrawal  from  Cambodia. 
Japan  cut  off  all  economic  aid  to  Vietnam  and  provided  substan- 
tial economic  assistance  to  Thailand  to  help  with  resettling  Indo- 
chinese  refugees.  China  was  a  key  supporter  of  Thailand  and  of 
the  Cambodian  resistance  groups.  In  Southwest  Asia,  both  nations 
backed  the  condemnation  of  the  Soviet  occupation  of  Afghanistan, 
refused  to  recognize  the  Soviet-backed  Kabul  regime,  and  sought 
through  diplomatic  and  economic  means  to  bolster  Pakistan.  In 
Northeast  Asia,  Japan  and  China  sought  to  moderate  the  behavior 
of  their  Korean  partners — South  Korea  and  North  Korea, 
respectively — to  reduce  tensions.  In  1983  both  China  and  Japan 
strongly  criticized  the  Soviet  proposal  to  redeploy  some  of  their 
European-based  SS-20  missiles  to  Asia. 

Complementary  economic  interests  also  strengthened  Sino- 
Japanese  relations.  Japan  was  a  major  source  of  capital,  technol- 
ogy, and  equipment  for  China's  modernization  drive.  In  fact,  Japan 
had  been  China's  largest  trading  partner  since  the  mid-1960s,  ac- 
counting for  more  than  20  percent  of  China's  total  trade.  Bilateral 
trade  exploded  in  the  1970s  and  early  1980s,  from  US$1  billion 
in  the  early  1970s  to  over  US$8  billion  in  1982.  Japan  became 
China's  largest  creditor,  accounting  for  nearly  half  of  the  estimated 
US$30  billion  in  credit  China  lined  up  from  1979  to  1983. 

Although  its  share  of  Japan's  global  trade  was  still  small  (3  per- 
cent in  1982),  China  became  Japan's  sixth  largest  trading  part- 
ner. Japan  regarded  China  as  a  significant  source  of  coal,  oil,  and 
strategic  minerals,  such  as  tungsten  and  chromium,  and  as  an  im- 
portant market  for  Japanese  steel,  machinery  plant  equipment, 
chemical  products,  and  synthetic  textile  fibers. 

The  optimism  that  marked  the  economic  relationship  in  the  late 
1970s  had  given  way  to  a  greater  degree  of  realism  on  both  sides 
by  the  early  1980s.  China's  decision  to  curtail  imports  of  heavy 
industrial  goods  in  1981  and  1982  had  a  sobering  effect  on  the 
Japanese.  Businesspeople  in  Japan  came  to  appreciate  the  problems 
China  faced,  and  revised  their  expections  of  the  growth  of  economic 
ties  as  the  Chinese  experimented  with  various  economic  policies. 
The  Japanese  continued  to  hope  that  they  would  profit  from  China's

potentially  huge  domestic  market,  whenever  its  modernization 
began  to  pick  up  speed. 

Japanese  economic  interests  in  China  focused  on  developing 
energy  resources  and  infrastructure  and  on  promoting  commer- 
cial trade.  As  of  1983,  the  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund, 
Tokyo's  official  aid  organization,  had  agreed  to  grant  US$3.5  bil- 
lion in  loans  to  China  for  basic  infrastructure  projects,  such  as  port 
and  rail  modernization.  In  addition,  the  Japan  Export-Import  Bank 
extended  US$2  billion  for  oil  exploration  and  coal  mining  at  a  6.25 
percent  annual  interest  rate,  the  lowest  rate  China  had  gained  from 
any  country  at  that  time.  The  Japanese  were  heavily  involved  in 
China's  oil  industry,  and  Japanese  drilling  in  the  Bohai  Gulf  ap- 
peared promising. 

Japan  encountered  a  number  of  episodes  of  friction  with  China 
during  the  rest  of  the  1980s.  In  late  1985,  Chinese  officials  com- 
plained harshly  about  Prime  Minister  Nakasone's  visit  to  the 
Yasukuni  Shrine,  which  commemorates  Japan's  war  dead,  and  in 
mid- 1986  they  complained  about  the  latest  revision  of  Japan's  his- 
tory textbooks  to  soften  accounts  of  World  War  II  atrocities.  Eco- 
nomic issues  centered  on  Chinese  complaints  that  the  influx  of 
Japanese  products  into  China  had  produced  a  serious  trade  deficit 
for  China.  Nakasone  and  other  Japanese  leaders  were  able  to  reduce 
these  official  concerns  during  visits  to  Beijing  and  in  other  talks 
with  Chinese  officials.  Notably,  they  assured  the  Chinese  of  Japan's 
continued  large-scale  development  and  commercial  assistance.  At 
the  popular  level  in  China,  it  was  not  easy  to  allay  concerns. 
Student-led  demonstrations  against  Japan,  on  the  one  hand,  helped 
reinforce  Chinese  officials'  warnings  to  their  Japanese  counterparts. 
On  the  other  hand,  it  was  more  difficult  to  change  popular  opin- 
ion in  China  than  it  was  to  change  the  opinions  of  the  Chinese 
officials.  Meanwhile,  the  removal  of  party  chief  Hu  Yaobang  in 
early  1987  was  detrimental  to  smooth  Sino-Japanese  relations,  since 
Hu  had  built  personal  relationships  with  Nakasone  and  other 
Japanese  leaders. 

The  Chinese  government's  harsh  crackdown  on  prodemocracy 
demonstrations  in  the  spring  of  1989  caused  Japanese  policymak- 
ers to  realize  that  the  new  situation  in  China  was  extremely  deli- 
cate and  required  careful  handling  to  avoid  Japanese  actions  that 
would  push  China  farther  away  from  reform.  At  the  same  time, 
these  policymakers  were  loathe  to  break  ranks  with  the  United  States 
and  other  Western  countries,  where  popular  opinion  and  domes- 
tic pressures  to  varying  degrees  required  that  officials  condemn  the 
crackdown  and  take  action  to  restrict  economic  or  other  interaction 
of  benefit  to  the  Chinese  regime.  Beijing  leaders  reportedly  judged 


399 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

at  first  that  the  industrialized  countries  would  relatively  quickly 
resume  normal  business  with  China  after  a  brief  period  of  com- 
plaint over  the  Tiananmen  Incident.  When  that  did  not  happen, 
the  Chinese  officials  made  strong  suggestions  to  Japanese  officials 
that  they  break  from  most  industrialized  nations  by  pursuing  nor- 
mal economic  intercourse  with  China,  consistent  with  Tokyo's  long- 
term  interests  in  China.  Japanese  leaders — like  West  European  and 
United  States  leaders — were  careful  not  to  isolate  China,  and  con- 
tinued trade  and  other  relations  generally  consistent  with  the  poli- 
cies of  other  industrialized  democracies.  But  they  also  followed  the 
United  States  lead  in  limiting  economic  relations  notably  advan- 
tageous to  China.  In  particular,  they  held  back  for  one  year  the 
disbursement  of  ¥810  billion  in  aid,  which  Japan  had  promised 
in  1988  to  give  China  in  the  1990-95  period. 

Relations  with  the  Soviet  Union 

The  1980s  saw  a  decided  hardening  in  Japanese  attitudes  toward 
the  Soviet  Union.  Japan  was  pressed  by  the  United  States  to  do 
more  to  check  the  expansion  of  Soviet  power  in  the  Third  World 
following  the  December  1979  Soviet  invasion  of  Afghanistan.  It 
responded  by  cutting  off  contacts  beneficial  to  the  Soviet  regime 
and  providing  assistance  to  "front  line"  Third  World  states,  such 
as  Pakistan  and  Thailand.  Under  Nakasone,  Japan  worked  hard 
to  demonstrate  a  close  identity  of  views  with  the  Reagan  adminis- 
tration on  the  Soviet  threat.  Japan  steadily  built  up  its  military 
forces,  welcomed  increases  in  United  States  forces  in  Japan  and 
the  Western  Pacific,  and  pledged  close  cooperation  to  deal  with 
the  danger  posed  by  Soviet  power. 

Although  public  and  media  opinion  remained  skeptical  of  the 
danger  to  Japan  posed  by  Soviet  forces  in  Asia,  there  was  strong 
opposition  in  Japan  to  Moscow's  refusal  to  accede  to  Japan's  claims 
to  the  Northern  Territories,  known  to  the  Japanese  as  Etorofu  and 
Kunashiri,  at  the  southern  end  of  the  Kuril  Island  chain,  and  the 
smaller  Shikotan  Island  and  the  Habomai  Islands,  northeast  of 
Hokkaido,  which  were  seized  by  the  Soviets  in  the  last  days  of  World 
War  II  (see  fig.  11).  The  stationing  of  Soviet  military  forces  on 
the  islands  gave  tangible  proof  of  the  Soviet  threat,  and  provoca- 
tive maneuvers  by  Soviet  air  and  naval  forces  in  Japanese-claimed 
territory  served  to  reinforce  Japanese  official  policy  of  close  iden- 
tification with  a  firm  United  States-backed  posture  against  Soviet

spokesmen  calling  for  greater  contact  with  Japan.  Gorbachev  took 
the  lead  in  promising  new  initiatives  in  Asia,  but  the  substance 
of  Soviet  policy  changed  more  slowly.  In  particular,  throughout

after  the  end  of  World  War  II,  a  state  of  war  between  Japan  and

territorial  dispute  over  the  Northern  Territories.

cluded Japanese  fishing  rights  in  the  Sea  of  Okhotsk  and  off  the

prisoners  of  war,  who,  the  Japanese  claimed,  were  still  being  held 
in  the  Soviet  Union.  Negotiation  of  these  issues  broke  down  early 
in  1956  because  of  tension  over  territorial  claims.

negotiations  for  a  peace  treaty,  including  territorial  issues.  In  ad- 
dition, the  Soviets  pledged  to  support  Japan  for  UN  membership

of  World  War  II,  in  violation  of  the  Japanese-Soviet  Neutrality 
Pact  of  1941. 

The  Soviet  Union  sought  to  induce  Japan  to  abandon  its  ter- 
ritorial claims  by  alternating  threats  and  persuasion.  As  early  as 
1956,  it  hinted  at  the  possibility  of  considering  the  return  of  the 
Habomai  Islands  and  Shikotan  Island  if  Japan  abandoned  its  alli- 
ance with  the  United  States.  In  1960  the  Soviet  government  warned 
Japan  against  signing  the  Treaty  of  Mutual  Cooperation  and  Secu- 
rity with  the  United  States,  and  after  the  treaty  was  signed  declared 
that  it  would  not  hand  over  the  Habomai  Islands  and  Shikotan 
Island  under  any  circumstances  unless  Japan  abrogated  the  treaty 
forthwith.  In  1964  the  Soviet  government  offered  to  return  these 
islands  unconditionally  if  the  United  States  ended  its  military 
presence  on  Okinawa  and  the  main  islands  of  Japan. 

Despite  divergence  on  the  territorial  question,  on  which  neither 
side  was  prepared  to  give  ground,  Japanese  relations  with  the  Soviet 
Union  improved  appreciably  after  the  mid-1960s.  The  Soviet 
government  began  to  seek  Japanese  cooperation  in  its  economic 
development  plans,  and  the  Japanese  responded  positively.  The 
two  countries  signed  a  five-year  trade  agreement  in  January  1966 
and  a  civil  aviation  agreement  as  well. 

Economic  cooperation  expanded  rapidly  during  the  1970s,  despite 
an  often  strained  political  relationship.  The  two  economies  were 
complementary,  for  the  Soviet  Union  needed  Japan's  capital,  tech- 
nology, and  consumer  goods,  while  Japan  needed  Soviet  natural 
resources,  such  as  oil,  gas,  coal,  iron  ore,  and  timber.  By  1979 
overall  trade  had  reached  US$4.4  billion  annually  and  had  made 
Japan,  next  to  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany), 
the  Soviet  Union's  most  important  nonsocialist  trading  partner. 

This  economic  cooperation  was  interrupted  by  Japan's  decision 
in  1980  to  participate  in  sanctions  against  the  Soviet  Union  for  its 
invasion  of  Afghanistan  and  by  its  actions  to  hold  in  abeyance  a 
number  of  projects  being  negotiated,  to  ban  the  export  of  some 
high- technology  items,  and  to  suspend  Siberian  development  loans. 
Subsequently,  Japanese  interest  in  economic  cooperation  with  the 
Soviet  Union  waned  as  Tokyo  found  alternative  suppliers  and  re- 
mained uncertain  about  the  economic  viability  and  political  sta- 
bility of  the  Soviet  Union  under  Gorbachev.  Japan-Soviet  trade 
in  1988  was  valued  at  nearly  US$6  billion. 

Japan-Soviet  political  relations  during  the  1970s  were  charac- 
terized by  the  frequent  exchange  of  high-level  visits  to  explore  the 
possibility  of  improving  bilateral  relations  and  by  repeated  discus- 
sions of  a  peace  treaty,  which  were  abortive  because  neither  side 
was  prepared  to  yield  on  the  territorial  issue.  Minister  of  Foreign

Foreign  Relations 


Affairs  Andrei  Gromyko  of  the  Soviet  Union  visited  Tokyo  in  Janu- 
ary 1972 — one  month  before  United  States  president  Nixon's  his- 
toric visit  to  China — to  reopen  ministerial-level  talks  after  a  six-year 
lapse.  Other  high-level  talks,  including  an  October  1973  meeting 
between  Prime  Minister  Tanaka  Kakuei  and  Leonid  I.  Brezhnev, 
general  secretary  of  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union,  were 
held  in  Moscow  during  the  next  three  years,  but  the  deadlock  on 
the  territorial  issue  continued  and  prospects  for  a  settlement 
dimmed.  Moscow  began  to  propose  a  treaty  of  friendship  and  good- 
will as  an  interim  step  while  peace  treaty  talks  were  continued.  This 
proposal  was  firmly  rejected  by  Japan. 

After  1975  the  Soviet  Union  began  openly  to  warn  that  the 
Japanese  peace  treaty  with  China  might  jeopardize  Soviet-Japan 
relations.  In  January  1976,  Gromyko  again  visited  Tokyo  to  re- 
sume talks  on  the  peace  treaty.  When  the  Japanese  again  refused 
to  budge  on  the  territorial  question,  Gromyko,  according  to  the 
Japanese,  offered  to  return  two  of  the  Soviet-held  island  areas — 
the  Habomai  Islands  and  Shikotan  Island — if  Japan  would  sign 
a  treaty  of  goodwill  and  cooperation.  He  also  reportedly  warned 
the  Japanese,  in  an  obvious  reference  to  China,  against  "forces 
which  come  out  against  the  relaxation  of  tension  and  which  try  to 
complicate  relations  between  states,  including  our  countries." 

The  signing  of  the  Sino-Japanese  peace  treaty  in  mid- 1978  was 
a  major  setback  to  Japanese- Soviet  relations.  Despite  Japanese  pro- 
testations that  the  treaty's  antihegemony  clause  was  not  directed 
against  any  specific  country,  Moscow  saw  it  as  placing  Tokyo  with 
Washington  and  Beijing  firmly  in  the  anti- Soviet  camp.  Officially, 
both  sides  continued  to  express  the  desire  for  better  relations,  but 
Soviet  actions  served  only  to  alarm  and  alienate  the  Japanese  side. 
The  1980s  Soviet  military  buildup  in  the  Pacific  was  a  case  in  point. 

Changes  in  Soviet  policy  carried  out  under  Gorbachev  begin- 
ning in  the  mid-1980s,  including  attempts  at  domestic  reform  and 
the  pursuit  of  detente  with  the  United  States  and  Western  Europe, 
elicited  generally  positive  Japanese  interest,  but  the  Japanese 
government  held  that  the  Soviet  Union  had  not  changed  its  poli- 
cies on  issues  vital  to  Japan.  The  government  stated  that  it  would 
not  conduct  normal  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union  until  Moscow 
returned  the  Northern  Territories.  The  government  and  Japanese 
business  leaders  stated  further  that  Japanese  trade  with  and  invest- 
ment in  the  Soviet  Union  would  not  grow  appreciably  until  the 
Northern  Territories  issue  was  resolved. 

By  1990  the  Soviet  government  had  altered  its  tactics.  The  Soviets 
now  acknowledged  that  the  territorial  issue  was  a  problem  and 
talked  about  it  with  Japanese  officials  at  the  highest  levels  and  in 


405

working-level  meetings.  Soviet  officials  reportedly  floated  a  proposal 
to  lease  the  Northern  Territories  and  part  of  Sakhalin — once  a 
colonial  holding  of  Japan's — to  Japan.  Gorbachev  and  others  also 
referred  to  a  1956  Soviet  offer  to  return  one  of  the  three  main  is- 
lands (Shikotan,  the  smallest  of  the  three)  and  the  Habomai  Is- 
lands, and  there  were  indications  that  Moscow  might  be  prepared 
to  revive  the  offer.  The  Soviets  emphasized  that  they  would  not 
return  all  the  islands  because  of  Soviet  public  opposition  and  the 
possible  reawakening  of  other  countries'  territorial  claims  against 
the  Soviet  Union.  The  Soviet  military  reportedly  opposed  a  return, 
because  the  Kuril  chain  provided  a  protective  barrier  to  the  Sea 
of  Okhotsk,  where  the  Soviet  navy  deployed  submarines  carrying 
long-range  ballistic  missiles. 

The  Soviet  government  also  stepped  up  its  diplomacy  toward 
Japan  with  the  announcement  in  1990  that  Gorbachev  would  visit 
Japan  in  1991 .  Soviet  officials  asserted  that  their  government  would 
propose  disarmament  talks  with  Japan  and  might  make  more 
proposals  on  the  Northern  Territories  in  connection  with  the  visit. 
Observers  believed  that  Gorbachev  might  propose  a  package  dealing 
with  the  islands,  arms  reduction,  and  economic  cooperation.  In 
January  1990,  the  Japanese  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  shifted  its 
position,  which  previously  had  rejected  negotiations  with  the  Soviet 
Union  on  arms  reductions,  indicating  that  Japan  would  be  willing 
to  negotiate.  Ministry  officials  stated  that  the  government  would 
formulate  policy  on  arms  reduction  in  close  coordination  with  the 
United  States. 

Relations  with  Other  Asia-Pacific  Countries 

Japan's  rapid  rise  as  the  dominant  economic  power  in  Asia  in 
the  1980s  helped  to  define  Japanese  policy  toward  this  diverse 
region,  stretching  from  South  Asia  to  the  islands  in  the  South  Pa- 
cific Ocean.  The  decline  in  East- West  and  Sino-Soviet  tensions  dur- 
ing the  1980s  suggested  that  economic  rather  than  military  power 
would  determine  regional  leadership.  During  the  decade,  Japan 
displaced  the  United  States  as  the  largest  provider  of  new  business 
investment  and  economic  aid  in  the  region,  although  the  United 
States  market  remained  a  major  source  of  Asia-Pacific  dynamism. 
Especially  following  the  rise  in  value  of  the  yen  relative  to  the  dol- 
lar in  the  late- 1980s,  Japan's  role  as  a  capital  and  technology  ex- 
porter and  as  an  increasingly  significant  importer  of  Asian 
manufactured  goods  made  it  the  core  economy  of  the  Asia-Pacific 
region. 

From  the  mid-1950s  to  the  late  1960s,  Japan's  relations  with  the 
rest  of  Asia  were  concerned  mainly  with  promoting  its  far-flung,

multiplying  economic  interests  in  the  region  through  trade,  tech- 
nical assistance,  and  aid.  Its  main  problems  were  the  economic 
weakness  and  political  instability  of  its  trading  partners  and  the 
growing  apprehension  of  Asian  leaders  over  Japan's  "over- 
presence"  in  their  region. 

Japan  began  to  normalize  relations  with  its  neighbors  during  the 
1950s  after  a  series  of  intermittent  negotiations,  which  led  to  the 
payment  of  war  reparations  to  Burma,  Indonesia,  the  Philippines, 
and  the  Republic  of  Vietnam  (South  Vietnam).  Thailand's  repa- 
rations claims  were  not  settled  until  1963.  Japan's  reintegration 
into  the  Asian  scene  was  also  facilitated  early  by  its  joining  the 
Colombo  Plan  for  Cooperative  Economic  and  Social  Development 
in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  in  December  1954  and  by  its  attendance 
at  the  April  1955  Afro-Asian  Conference  in  Bandung,  Indonesia. 
In  the  late  1950s,  Japan  made  a  limited  beginning  in  its  aid  pro- 
gram. In  1958  it  extended  the  equivalent  of  US$50  million  in  credits 
to  India,  the.  first  Japanese  loan  of  its  kind  in  post- World  War  II 
years.  As  in  subsequent  cases  involving  India,  as  well  as  Sri  Lanka, 
Malaysia,  Taiwan,  Pakistan,  and  South  Korea,  these  credits  were 
rigidly  bound  to  projects  that  promoted  plant  and  equipment  pur- 
chases from  Japan.  In  1960  Japan  officially  established  the  Insti- 
tute of  Asian  Economic  Affairs  (renamed  the  Institute  of  Developing 
Economies  in  1969)  as  the  principal  training  center  for  its  specialists 
in  economic  diplomacy. 


407 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

In  the  early  1960s,  the  government  adopted  a  more  forward 
posture  in  seeking  to  establish  contacts  in  Asia.  In  1960  the  Insti- 
tute of  Asian  Economic  Affairs  was  placed  under  the  jurisdiction 
of  the  Ministry  of  International  Trade  and  Industry  (MITI).  In 
1961  the  government  established  the  Overseas  Economic  Cooper- 
ation Fund  as  a  new  lending  agency.  The  following  year  the  Over- 
seas Technical  Cooperation  Agency  made  its  debut. 

By  the  mid-1960s,  Japan's  role  had  become  highly  visible  in  Asia 
as  well  as  elsewhere  in  the  world.  In  1966  Japan  became  a  full  mem- 
ber of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Develop- 
ment (OECD — see  Glossary).  As  economic  and  trade  expansion 
burgeoned,  leaders  began  to  question  the  propriety  and  wisdom 
of  what  they  variously  described  as  ''mere  economism,"  an 
"export-first  policy,"  and  the  "commercial  motives  of  aid."  They 
wanted  to  contribute  more  to  the  solution  of  the  North- South 
problem,  as  they  dubbed  the  issue — the  tenuous  relationship  be- 
tween the  developed  countries  and  the  developing  countries. 

Efforts  since  the  beginning  of  the  1970s  to  assume  a  leading  role 
in  promoting  peace  and  stability  in  Asia,  especially  Southeast  Asia, 
by  providing  economic  aid  and  by  offering  to  serve  as  a  mediator 
in  disputes,  faced  two  constraints.  Externally  there  was  fear  in  parts 
of  Asia  that  Japan's  systematic  economic  penetration  into  the  region 
would  eventually  lead  to  something  akin  to  its  pre-World  War  II 
scheme  to  exploit  Asian  markets  and  materials.  Internally,  foreign 
policymakers  were  apprehensive  that  Japan's  political  involvement 
in  the  area  in  whatever  capacity  would  almost  certainly  precipi- 
tate an  anti-Japanese  backlash  and  adversely  affect  its  economic 
position. 

After  a  reassessment  of  policy,  the  Japanese  leadership  appeared 
to  have  decided  that  more  emphasis  ought  to  be  given  to  helping 
the  developing  countries  of  the  region  modernize  their  industrial 
bases  to  increase  their  self-reliance  and  economic  resilience.  In  the 
late  1970s,  Japan  seemed  to  have  decided  that  bilateral  aid  in  the 
form  of  yen  credits,  tariff  reductions,  larger  quota  incentives  for 
manufactured  exports,  and  investments  in  processing  industries, 
energy,  agriculture,  and  education  would  be  the  focus  of  its  aid 
programs  in  Asia. 

By  1990,  Japan's  interaction  with  the  vast  majority  of  Asia-Pacific 
countries,  especially  its  burgeoning  economic  exchanges,  was  multi- 
faceted  and  increasingly  important  to  the  recipient  countries.  The 
developing  countries  of  ASEAN  (Brunei,  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the 
Philippines,  and  Thailand;  Singapore  was  treated  as  a  newly  in- 
dustrialized economy,  or  NIE)  regarded  Japan  as  critical  to  their 
development.  Japanese  aid  to  the  ASEAN  countries  totaled  US$1 .9

billion  in  Japanese  fiscal  year  (FY — see  Glossary)  1988  versus  about 
US$333  million  for  the  United  States  during  United  States  FY  1988. 
Japan  was  the  number  one  foreign  investor  in  the  ASEAN  coun- 
tries, with  cumulative  investment  as  of  March  1989  of  about 
US$14.5  billion,  more  than  twice  that  of  the  United  States.  Japan's 
share  of  total  foreign  investment  in  ASEAN  countries  ranged  from 
70-80  percent  in  Thailand  to  20  percent  in  Indonesia. 

South  Asia 

In  South  Asia,  Japan's  role  was  mainly  that  of  an  aid  donor. 
Japanese  aid  to  seven  South  Asian  countries  totaled  US$1.1  bil- 
lion in  1988,  about  the  same  as  the  United  States  gave.  Except 
for  Pakistan,  which  received  heavy  inputs  of  aid  from  the  United 
States,  all  other  South  Asian  countries  received  most  of  their  aid 
from  Japan.  Four  South  Asian  nations — India,  Pakistan,  Bangla- 
desh, and  Sri  Lanka — were  in  the  top  ten  list  of  Tokyo's  aid  recip- 
ients worldwide. 

Prime  Minister  Kaifu  signaled  a  broadening  of  Japan's  interest 
in  South  Asia  with  his  swing  through  the  region  in  April  1990.  In 
an  address  to  the  Indian  parliament,  Kaifu  stressed  the  role  of  free 
markets  and  democracy  in  bringing  about  "a  new  international 
order, ' '  and  emphasized  the  need  for  a  settlement  of  the  Kashmir 
territorial  dispute  between  India  and  Pakistan,  and  for  economic 
liberalization  to  attract  foreign  investment  and  promote  dynamic 
growth.  To  India,  which  was  very  short  of  hard  currency,  Kaifu 
pledged  a  new  concessional  loan  of  ¥100  billion  (about  US$650 
million)  for  the  coming  year. 

Newly  Industrialized  Economies 

Japan's  relationships  with  the  NIEs  (South  Korea,  Taiwan,  Hong 
Kong,  and  Singapore — often  called  the  Four  Tigers)  were  marked 
by  both  cooperation  and  competition.  After  the  early  1980s,  when 
Tokyo  extended  a  large  financial  credit  to  South  Korea  for  essen- 
tially political  reasons,  Japan  avoided  significant  aid  relationships 
with  the  NIEs.  Relations  instead  involved  capital  investment,  tech- 
nology transfer,  and  trade.  Increasingly,  the  NIEs  came  to  be 
viewed  as  Japan's  rivals  in  the  competition  for  export  markets  for 
manufactured  goods,  especially  the  vast  United  States  market  (see 
International  Economic  Cooperation  and  Aid,  ch.  5). 

Australia,  New  Zealand,  and  the  Pacific  Islands 

Japan's  economic  involvement  in  Australia  was  heavily  tilted 
toward  extraction  of  natural  resources  and  in-country  manufac- 
turing for  the  Australian  domestic  market.  Japanese  investment

by  1988  made  Australia  the  single  largest  source  of  Japanese  re- 
gional imports.  Japan's  trade  with  New  Zealand  was  a  small  frac- 
tion of  its  trade  with  Australia. 

Politically,  Japan's  relations  with  Australia  and  New  Zealand 
had  elements  of  tension  as  well  as  acknowledged  mutuality  of  in- 
terest. Memories  of  World  War  II  lingered  among  the  public,  as 
did  a  contemporary  fear  of  Japanese  economic  domination.  At  the 
same  time,  government  and  business  leaders  saw  Japan  as  a  vital 
export  market  and  an  essential  element  in  Australia's  and  New 
Zealand's  future  growth  and  prosperity. 

By  1990  commercial  and  strategic  interests  prompted  a  strong 
surge  in  Japanese  involvement  in  the  newly  independent  island  na- 
tions of  the  Pacific.  Japan's  rapidly  growing  aid  to  the  South  Pa- 
cific was  seen  by  many  as  a  response  to  United  States  calls  for 
greater  burden-sharing,  and  to  the  adoption  of  the  1982  Conven- 
tion on  Law  of  the  Sea,  which  gave  states  legal  control  over  fish- 
ery resources  within  their  200-nautical-mile  economic  zones.  Japan 
was  second  after  Australia  as  an  aid  donor  to  the  region.  The  US$93 
million  it  provided  in  1988  was  more  than  three  times  the  United 
States  aid  of  US$26.7  million  in  FY  1988.  Japanese  companies  also 
invested  heavily  in  the  tourism  industry  in  the  island  nations. 

The  Koreas 

Japan's  policies  toward  the  two  Koreas  reflected  the  importance 
this  area  had  for  Asian  stability,  which  was  seen  as  essential  to 
Japanese  peace  and  prosperity.  In  1990  Japan  remained  one  of  four 
major  powers  (along  with  the  United  States,  the  Soviet  Union,  and 
China)  that  had  important  security  interests  on  the  Korean  Penin- 
sula. However,  Japan's  involvement  in  political  and  security  is- 
sues on  the  Korean  Peninsula  was  more  limited  than  that  of  the 
other  three  powers.  Japan's  relations  with  North  Korea  and  South 
Korea  had  a  legacy  of  bitterness  stemming  from  harsh  Japanese 
colonial  rule  over  Korea  from  1910  to  1945.  Polls  during  the  post- 
war period  in  Japan  and  South  Korea  showed  that  the  people  of 
each  nation  had  a  profound  dislike  of  the  other  country  and  people. 

Article  9  of  Japan's  Constitution  is  interpreted  to  bar  Japan  from 
entering  into  security  relations  with  countries  other  than  the  United 
States.  Consequently,  Japan  had  no  substantive  defense  relation- 
ship with  South  Korea,  and  military  contacts  were  infrequent.  The 
Japanese  government  supported  noncommunist  South  Korea  in 
other  ways.  It  backed  United  States  contingency  plans  to  dispatch 
United  States  armed  forces  in  Japan  to  South  Korea  in  case  of  a 
North  Korean  attack  on  South  Korea.  It  also  acted  as  an  inter- 
mediary between  South  Korea  and  China.  It  pressed  the  Chinese

government  to  open  and  expand  relations  with  South  Korea  in  the 
1980s. 

Japan's  trade  with  South  Korea  was  US$27.25  billion  in  1988, 
with  a  surplus  of  US$3.63  billion  on  the  Japanese  side.  Japanese 
direct  private  investment  in  South  Korea  totaled  US$3.25  billion 
in  1988.  Japanese  and  South  Korean  firms  often  had  interdepen- 
dent relations,  which  gave  Japan  advantages  in  South  Korea's 
growing  market.  Many  South  Korean  products  were  based  on  Japa- 
nese design  and  technology.  A  surge  in  imports  of  South  Korean 
products  into  Japan  in  1990  was  due  partly  to  production  by 
Japanese  investors  in  South  Korea. 

Japan- North  Korean  relations  remained  antagonistic  in  the  late 
1980s.  The  two  governments  did  not  maintain  diplomatic  relations 
and  had  no  substantive  contacts.  The  opposition  Japan  Socialist 
Party,  however,  had  cordial  relations  with  the  North  Korean 
regime . 

Issues  in  Japan-North  Korean  relations  that  produced  tensions 
included  North  Korean  media  attacks  on  Japan,  Japan's  imposi- 
tion of  economic  sanctions  on  North  Korea  for  terrorist  acts  against 
South  Korea  in  the  1980s,  and  unpaid  North  Korean  debts  to 
Japanese  enterprises  of  about  US$50  million.  Japan  allowed  trade 
with  North  Korea  through  unofficial  channels.  This  unofficial  trade 
reportedly  came  to  more  than  US$200  million  annually  in  the  1980s. 

Vietnam  and  Cambodia 

Stability  in  Indochina  also  was  very  important  to  Japanese  in- 
terests. During  the  Vietnam  war  of  the  1960s  and  1970s,  Japan 
had  consistently  encouraged  a  negotiated  settlement  at  the  earliest 
possible  date.  Even  before  the  hostilities  ended,  it  had  made  con- 
tact with  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Vietnam  (North  Vietnam) 
government  and  had  reached  an  agreement  to  establish  diplo- 
matic relations  in  September  1973.  Implementation,  however,  was 
delayed  by  North  Vietnamese  demands  that  Japan  pay  the  equiva- 
lent of  US$45  million  in  World  War  II  reparations  in  two  yearly 
installments,  in  the  form  of  "economic  cooperation"  grants.  Giv- 
ing in  to  the  Vietnamese  demands,  Japan  paid  the  money  and 
opened  an  embassy  in  Hanoi  in  October  1975  following  the  unifi- 
cation of  North  Vietnam  and  South  Vietnam  into  the  Socialist 
Republic  of  Vietnam.  Recognition  of  the  communist  Khmer  Rouge 
regime  in  Cambodia  came  in  1975,  and  diplomatic  relations  with 
that  country  were  established  in  August  1976. 

This  Indochina  policy  was  justified  at  home  and  to  the  member 
countries  of  ASEAN — some  of  which  were  hostile  to  and  suspicious 
of  Vietnam — on  the  grounds  that  official  contacts  and  eventually 


411 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

aid  to  Vietnam  would  promote  the  peace  and  stability  of  Southeast 
Asia  as  a  whole.  In  December  1978,  after  a  visit  to  Tokyo  by  Viet- 
nam's minister  of  foreign  affairs,  Nguyen  Duy  Trinh,  Japan  agreed 
to  give  Vietnam  US$195  million  in  grant  aid,  as  well  as  commodity 
loans  and  food  shipments.  When  Vietnam  launched  its  invasion 
of  Cambodia  later  that  same  month,  Japan  was  embarrassed  and 
irritated.  It  joined  ASEAN  in  condemning  the  invasion,  supported 
the  UN  resolution  calling  for  immediate  withdrawal  of  Vietnamese 
forces,  and  suspended  the  aid  commitments  it  had  made  with 
Hanoi. 

Japan  and  the  United  States  shared  common  ground  in  oppos- 
ing the  Soviet-backed  Vietnamese  invasion  of  Cambodia  in  De- 
cember 1978.  Japan's  policy  of  restricting  aid  and  other  economic 
cooperation  with  Vietnam  reinforced  international  pressures  on 
Hanoi  to  pull  back  its  forces  and  seek  a  comprehensive  Cambodian 
settlement.  Faced  with  international  isolation,  waning  Soviet  bloc 
support,  continued  armed  resistance  in  Cambodia,  and  large-scale 
economic  problems  at  home,  Hanoi  withdrew  most  if  not  all  of  its 
combat  troops  from  Cambodia  in  1989.  It  appealed  to  developed 
countries  to  open  channels  of  economic  cooperation,  trade,  and 
aid.  Although  some  Japanese  businesses  were  interested  in  invest- 
ment and  trade  with  Vietnam  and  Cambodia,  the  Japanese  govern- 
ment still  opposed  economic  cooperation  with  those  countries  until 
there  was  a  comprehensive  settlement  in  Cambodia.  This  stand 
was  basically  consistent  with  United  States  policy  of  the  time. 

Meanwhile,  Japan  gave  informal  assurances  that  Tokyo  was  pre- 
pared to  bear  a  large  share  of  the  financial  burden  to  help  with 
reconstruction  aid  to  Cambodia,  whenever  a  comprehensive  set- 
tlement was  reached,  and  to  help  fund  UN  or  other  international 
peacekeeping  forces,  should  they  be  required. 

Relations  with  Other  Countries 

Japan  had  diplomatic  relations  with  nearly  all  independent  na- 
tions and  had  been  an  active  member  of  the  UN  since  December 
1956.  Its  relations  with  countries  other  than  those  discussed  above 
were  mainly  commercial  and  economic.  It  had  few  major  political 
differences  with  any  of  them  but  was  under  continuing  pressure 
from  many  to  limit  its  exports  and  to  remove  restrictions  imposed 
on  the  import  of  foreign  goods  and  capital.  It  was  also  being  pressed 
to  contribute  more  to  the  socioeconomic  betterment  of  the  nations 
of  the  Third  World. 

During  the  1970s,  the  government  took  positive  measures  to  in- 
crease its  Official  Development  Assistance  (ODA)  to  developing 
countries  and  to  contribute  to  the  stabilization  of  the  international 


412

trade  and  monetary  system.  These  measures  were  generally  wel- 
comed abroad,  although  some  countries  felt  that  the  steps  taken 
were  not  executed  as  rapidly  or  were  not  as  extensive  as  similar 
efforts  by  some  other  advanced  industrialized  nations.  Japan's  ODA 
increased  tenfold  during  the  decade  and  stood  at  US$3.3  billion 
in  1980,  but  this  ODA  as  a  percentage  of  GNP  was  still  below  the 
average  of  other  donor  countries. 

In  the  1980s,  Japan's  ODA  continued  to  rise  rapidly.  ODA  net 
disbursements,  in  nominal  terms,  averaged  around  US$3  billion 
per  year  in  the  early  1980s,  and  jumped  to  US$5.6  billion  in  1986 
and  US$9.1  billion  in  1988.  Japan's  share  of  total  disbursements 
from  major  aid  donors  also  grew  significantly,  from  1 1.76  percent 
in  1979  to  about  15  percent  in  the  mid-1980s,  and  to  nearly  19 
percent  in  1988.  Japan's  ODA  as  a  percentage  of  its  GNP,  however, 
did  not  increase  substantially  during  the  1980s,  remaining  at  about 
0.3  percent. 

Japan  continued  to  concentrate  its  economic  assistance  in  Asia 
(about  72  percent  of  total  commitments  in  1987-88),  reflecting  its 
historical  and  economic  ties  to  the  region.  Japan  made  modest  in- 
creases in  aid  to  Africa  with  the  announcement  in  1989  of  a  US$600 
million  grant  program  for  the  next  three  years.  In  early  1990,  Japan 
also  pledged  large  amounts  of  assistance  to  Eastern  Europe,  but 


413 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

most  of  that  aid  was  to  be  in  the  form  of  market  rate  credits  and 
investment  insurance,  which  did  not  qualify  as  ODA.  In  other 
regions,  Japan  appeared  likely  to  continue  allocating  relatively  small 
shares  of  assistance.  Nevertheless,  by  1987  Japan  had  become  the 
largest  bilateral  donor  in  twenty-nine  countries,  nearly  double  the 
number  in  which  that  had  been  the  case  ten  years  earlier. 

The  continued  growth  of  Japan's  foreign  aid  appeared  to  be  moti- 
vated by  two  fundamental  factors.  First,  Japanese  policy  aimed 
at  assuming  international  responsibilities  commensurate  with  its 
position  as  a  global  economic  power.  Second,  many  believed,  the 
growing  Japanese  foreign  aid  program  came  largely  in  response 
to  pressure  from  the  United  States  and  other  allies  for  Japan  to 
take  on  a  greater  share  of  the  financial  burdens  in  support  of  shared 
security,  political,  and  economic  interests. 

Although  cultural  and  noneconomic  ties  with  Western  Europe 
grew  significantly  during  the  1980s,  the  economic  nexus  remained 
by  far  the  most  important  element  of  Japanese-West  European  re- 
lations throughout  the  decade.  Events  in  West  European  relations, 
as  well  as  political,  economic,  or  even  military  matters,  were  topics 
of  concern  to  most  Japanese  commentators  because  of  the  immedi- 
ate implications  for  Japan.  The  major  issues  centered  on  the  effect 
of  the  coming  West  European  economic  unification  on  Japan's 
trade,  investment,  and  other  opportunities  in  Western  Europe. 
Some  West  European  leaders  were  anxious  to  restrict  Japanese  ac- 
cess to  the  newly  integrated  European  Community,  but  others  ap- 
peared open  to  Japanese  trade  and  investment.  In  partial  response 
to  the  strengthening  economic  ties  among  nations  in  Western  Eu- 
rope and  to  the  1989  United  States-Canada  free  trade  agreement, 
Japan  and  other  countries  along  the  Asia-Pacific  rim  began  mov- 
ing in  the  late  1980s  toward  greater  economic  cooperation. 

International  Cooperation 

United  Nations 

At  the  beginning  of  the  1990s,  Japan  continued  to  regard  inter- 
national cooperation  within  the  UN  framework  as  a  basic  foreign 
policy  principle.  When  Japan  joined  the  UN  in  1956,  it  did  so  with 
great  enthusiasm  and  broad  public  support,  for  the  international 
organization  was  seen  to  embody  the  pacifist  country's  hopes  for 
a  peaceful  world  order.  Membership  was  welcomed  by  many 
Japanese  who  saw  the  UN  as  a  guarantor  of  a  policy  of  unarmed 
neutrality  for  their  nation.  To  others,  support  for  the  UN  would 
be  useful  in  masking  or  diluting  Japan's  almost  total  dependence 
on  the  United  States  for  its  security.  The  government  saw  the  UN 


414 


Foreign  Relations 


as  an  ideal  arena  for  its  risk-minimizing,  omnidirectional  foreign 
policy. 

After  the  late  1950s,  Japan  participated  actively  in  the  social  and 
economic  activities  of  the  UN's  various  specialized  agencies  and 
other  international  organizations  concerned  with  social,  cultural, 
and  economic  improvement.  During  the  1970s,  as  it  attained  the 
status  of  an  economic  superpower,  Japan  was  called  on  to  play  an 
increasingly  large  role  in  the  UN.  As  Japan's  role  increased  and 
its  contributions  to  UN  socioeconomic  development  activities  grew, 
many  Japanese  began  to  ask  whether  their  country  was  being  given 
an  international  position  of  responsibility  commensurate  with  its 
economic  power.  There  was  even  some  sentiment,  expressed  as 
early  as  1973,  that  Japan  should  be  given  a  permanent  seat  on  the 
UN  Security  Council  with  the  United  States,  the  Soviet  Union, 
Britain,  France,  and  China. 

By  1990  Japan's  international  cooperation  efforts  had  reached 
a  new  level  of  involvement  and  activism.  Japan  contributed  about 
11  percent  of  the  regular  UN  budget,  second  only  to  the  United 
States,  which  contributed  25  percent.  Japan  was  particularly  ac- 
tive in  UN  peacekeeping  activities  and  in  1989,  for  the  first  time, 
sent  officials  to  observe  and  participate  in  UN  peacekeeping  ef- 
forts (in  Afghanistan,  Iran,  Iraq,  and  Namibia).  Japan  sent  a  small 
team  to  observe  the  February  1990  elections  in  Nicaragua,  and 
planned  to  offer  more  than  100  people  to  help  supervise  elections 
in  Cambodia  if  the  UN  were  to  establish  a  presence  there. 

Other  Organizations 

In  addition  to  its  UN  activities  and  its  participation  in  Asian 
regional  groupings,  such  as  the  Colombo  Plan  and  the  Asian  De- 
velopment Bank,  Japan  was  also  involved,  beginning  in  the  1950s, 
in  worldwide  economic  groupings  largely  made  up  of,  or  domi- 
nated by,  the  industrialized  nations  of  Western  Europe  and  North 
America.  In  1952  Japan  became  a  member  of  the  IMF  and  of  the 
World  Bank,  where  it  played  an  increasingly  important  role.  In 
1955,  it  joined  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade 
(GATT — see  Glossary).  In  1966  Japan  was  admitted  to  the  OECD, 
which  brought  it  into  what  was  essentially  a  club  of  leading  indus- 
trialized nations.  Japan  has  participated  actively  since  1975  in  the 
annual  summit  meetings  of  the  seven  largest  capitalist  coun- 
tries— the  Group  of  Seven — Canada,  Federal  Republic  of  Germany, 
France,  Italy,  Japan,  Britain,  and  the  United  States. 

International  Banks 

Based  on  its  economic  power  and  performance,  Japan  steadily  ex- 
panded its  role  in  the  World  Bank,  the  IMF,  and  other  international 


415 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

financial  institutions.  Investment  and  trade  flows  made  Japan  by 
far  the  dominant  economic  nation  in  Asia.  Japanese  aid  and  in- 
vestment became  widely  sought  after  in  other  parts  of  the  world, 
and  it  appeared  to  be  only  a  matter  of  time  before  such  economic 
power  would  translate  into  greater  political  influence. 

In  the  multilateral  development  banks,  Japan's  financial  and  pol- 
icy positions  became  more  prominent.  Tokyo  had  assumed  a  leading 
role  at  the  Asian  Development  Bank  for  a  number  of  years.  At  the 
World  Bank,  Japan's  voting  share  represented  about  9.4  percent, 
compared  with  16.3  percent  for  the  United  States.  Japan  also  made 
several  "special"  contributions  to  particular  World  Bank  programs 
that  raised  its  financial  status  but  did  not  alter  its  voting  position. 
Japan  planned  to  participate  in  the  East  European  Development 
Bank,  making  a  contribution  of  8.5  percent,  the  same  as  the  United 
States  and  major  West  European  donors.  Japan  also  displayed  a 
growing  prominence  in  IMF  deliberations,  helping  ease  the  massive 
debt  burdens  of  Third  World  countries,  and  generally  supported 
efforts  at  the  GATT  1990  Uruguay  Round  of  trade  negotiations 
to  liberalize  world  trade  and  investment. 

Policy  after  the  Cold  War 

The  post-Cold  War  world  promised  an  important  position  for 
Japan.  Japanese  leaders  and  popular  opinion  remained  tentative 
and  uncertain  as  to  how  Japan  would  use  its  remarkable  economic 
power  in  order  to  preserve  and  enhance  Japanese  national  interests. 
There  seemed  to  be  little  alternative  to  a  continued  close  strategic 
relationship  with  the  United  States  and  a  general  international  out- 
look designed  to  promote  global  peace,  development,  and  access 
to  world  markets  and  resources.  Japanese  leaders  and  public  opinion 
were  often  anxious  to  see  Japan  assert  a  more  pronounced  posi- 
tion in  world  affairs,  but  the  tradition  of  caution  in  Japanese  for- 
eign policy  was  reinforced  by  the  still  unclear  outlines  of  the 
post-Cold  War  environment  that  would  affect  Japanese  foreign  pol- 
icy in  the  years  ahead.

JAPAN  IN  THE  EARLY  1990s  was  in  the  unusual  position  of 
being  a  major  world  economic  and  political  power,  with  an  ag- 
gressive military  tradition,  resisting  the  development  of  strong 
armed  forces.  A  military  proscription  is  included  as  Article  9  of 
the  1947  Constitution,  which  states,  "The  Japanese  people  forever 
renounce  war  as  a  sovereign  right  of  the  nation  and  the  threat  or 
use  of  force  as  a  means  of  settling  international  disputes. "  In  1990 
that  article,  along  with  the  rest  of  the  "Peace  Constitution,"  re- 
tained strong  government  and  citizen  support  and  was  interpreted 
as  permitting  the  Self-Defense  Forces  (SDF),  but  prohibiting  those 
forces  from  possessing  nuclear  weapons  or  other  offensive  arms  or 
being  deployed  outside  of  Japan. 

The  SDF  were  under  control  of  the  civilian  Defense  Agency, 
subordinate  to  the  prime  minister.  Although  highly  trained  and 
fully  qualified  to  perform  the  limited  missions  assigned  to  them, 
the  SDF  were  small,  understaffed,  and  underequipped  for  more 
extensive  military  operations,  and  as  of  1990  had  never  seen  ac- 
tion in  any  operation  other  than  disaster  relief. 

Japan's  national  defense  policy  has  been  based  on  maintaining 
the  1960  Treaty  of  Mutual  Cooperation  and  Security  with  the 
United  States,  under  which  Japan  assumed  unilateral  responsibil- 
ity for  its  own  internal  security  and  the  United  States  agreed  to 
join  in  Japan's  defense  in  the  event  that  Japan  or  its  territories  were 
attacked.  Although  the  size  and  capability  of  the  SDF  have  always 
limited  their  role,  until  1976  defense  planning  focused  on  develop- 
ing forces  adequate  to  deal  with  the  conventional  capabilities  of 
potential  regional  adversaries.  Beginning  in  1976,  government  pol- 
icy held  that  the  SDF  would  be  developed  only  to  repel  a  small- 
scale,  limited  invasion  and  that  the  nation  would  depend  on  the 
United  States  to  come  to  its  aid  in  the  event  of  a  more  serious  in- 
cursion. 

The  Soviet  invasion  of  Afghanistan  in  1979  and  the  buildup  of 
military  forces  in  the  Soviet  Far  East,  including  a  group  of  islands

but  claimed  by  Japan,  led  Japan  to  develop  a  program  to  modern- 
ize and  improve  the  SDF  in  the  1980s,  especially  in  air  defense 
and  antisubmarine  warfare.  In  1990  the  government  was  reevalu- 
ating its  security  policy  based  on  reduced  East-West  tensions  and 
improving  Soviet-Japanese  relations.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 


The  Japanese  government  valued  its  close  relations  with  the 
United  States  and  remained  dependent  on  the  United  States  nuclear 
umbrella.  Thus,  it  worked  to  facilitate  military  contacts  and  to  sup- 
port the  United  States  diplomatically  whenever  possible.  Both  the 
government  and  the  public,  however,  supported  only  limited  in- 
creases in  self-defense  capability.  National  security,  it  was  believed, 
is  fostered  by  international  diplomacy  and  economic  aid  as  much 
as  by  militai/  might. 

There  were  few  critical  issues  for  Japan's  internal  security  in 
1990.  Conditions  of  public  order  compared  favorably  with  those 
elsewhere  in  the  world.  The  crime  rate  was  remarkably  low,  kept 
that  way  by  well-organized  and  efficient  police  assisted  by  general 
citizen  cooperation  and  support. 

Militarism  Before  1945 
The  BushidO  Code 

Japanese  aversion  for  things  military  is  of  recent  origin.  For  cen- 
turies before  1945,  military  men  and  a  strong  martial  tradition  ex- 
erted a  powerful  and,  at  times,  dominant  influence  on  national  life. 
Although  the  development  of  a  modern  army  and  navy  came  only 
during  the  Meiji  period  (1868-1912),  reverence  for  the  art  of  war 
and  its  practitioners  had  long  been  characteristic  of  Japanese  society. 

In  the  middle  of  the  seventh  century,  under  the  Taika  Reform, 
the  Yamato  court  used  military  forces,  conscripted  from  the  peasants 
and  led  by  court-appointed  aristocrats,  to  extend  its  realm  and  main- 
tain order  (see  Early  Developments,  ch.  1).  Military  leaders  ini- 
tially were  loyal  to  the  emperors,  but  with  the  rise  of  the  great  private 
estates,  or  shoen,  in  the  mid-eighth  century,  imperial  control  waned 
(see  Nara  and  Heian  Periods  A.D.  710-1 185,  ch.  1).  National  con- 
scription was  abandoned  in  A.D.  792.  Decreased  imperial  authority 
gave  rise  to  chaotic  conditions  and  lawlessness  in  the  countryside. 
Provincial  officials  and  shoen  holders  used  local  militias,  civil  offi- 
cials under  arms,  and  soldiers  of  the  shoen  holders  to  secure  their 
land  and  compete  for  power. 

By  the  mid-twelfth  century,  these  local  armed  forces  had  devel- 
oped into  a  distinct  warrior  class  (bushi,  or  samurai),  completely 
overshadowing  the  military  strength  of  the  imperial  government. 
Empowered  by  a  nationwide,  feudal,  military  dictatorship,  the  chief 
national  figure,  the  shogun,  ruled  in  the  name  of  a  figurehead  em- 
peror. By  the  end  of  the  sixteenth  century,  samurai  dominated  the 
social  and  political  hierarchy  that  existed  under  the  shogun  and 
developed  into  a  hereditary  elite.  After  1603  they  alone  were  granted 
the  right  to  bear  the  sword,  which  subsequently  became  the  symbol 


422 


National  Security 


of  their  superior  status.  During  the  sixteenth  century,  a  wide  vari- 
ety of  firearms  also  was  introduced  from  Europe,  and  used  quite 
effectively,  particularly  against  some  of  the  outer  daimyo,  or  feudal 
lords. 

In  time,  a  customary  ethical  code,  bushido  (see  Glossary),  was 
developed.  According  to  this  doctrine,  the  samurai  was  bound  to 
accept  death  in  battle  rather  than  flight  or  surrender  and,  seeing 
corruption  or  disloyalty  in  another,  was  expected  to  slay  the  guilty 
party  and  then  commit  seppuku  (see  Glossary)  lest  his  honorable 
intentions  be  questioned.  As  an  ideal  of  conduct,  the  code  empha- 
sized personal  honesty,  reverence  and  respect  for  parents,  willing- 
ness to  sacrifice  oneself  for  family  honor,  consideration  for  the 
feelings  of  others,  indifference  to  pain,  loyalty  to  one's  superiors, 
and  unquestioning  obedience  to  duty  in  the  face  of  any  hardship 
or  danger.  Although  a  reality  that  often  fell  short  of  the  ideal,  bushido 
had  a  profound  and  lasting  impact  on  the  nation.  Its  effects  were 
still  seen  in  the  conduct  of  battle  in  World  War  II.  Banzai  (a  rally- 
ing cry  meaning  10,000  years)  charges  against  stronger  enemy  forces 
and  the  tenacity  of  resistance  under  severe  duress  testified  to  the 
strength  and  persistence  of  the  samurai  tradition. 

The  Modernization  of  the  Military,  1868-1931 

When  Western  powers  began  to  use  their  superior  military 
strength  to  press  Japan  for  trade  relations  in  the  1850s,  the  coun- 
try's decentralized  and,  by  Western  standards,  antiquated  mili- 
tary forces  were  unable  to  provide  an  effective  defense  against  their 
advances.  After  the  fall  of  the  Tokugawa  government  in  1867  and 
the  restoration  of  the  Meiji  emperor,  de  facto  political  and  adminis- 
trative power  shifted  to  a  group  of  younger  samurai  who  had  been 
instrumental  in  forming  the  new  system  and  were  committed  to 
modernizing  the  military.  They  introduced  drastic  changes,  which 
cleared  the  way  for  the  development  of  modern,  European- style 
armed  forces. 

Conscription  became  universal  and  obligatory  in  1872  and, 
although  samurai  wedded  to  the  traditional  prerogatives  of  their 
class  resisted,  by  1880  a  conscript  army  was  firmly  established.  The 
Imperial  Army  General  Staff  Office  was  established  directly  under 
the  emperor  in  1878  and  given  broad  powers  for  military  planning 
and  strategy.  The  new  force  eventually  made  the  samurai  spirit 
its  own.  Loyalties  formerly  accorded  to  feudal  lords  were  trans- 
ferred to  the  state  and  to  the  emperor.  Upon  release  from  service, 
soldiers  carried  these  ideals  back  to  their  home  communities,  ex- 
tending military-derived  standards  to  all  classes. 


423 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

An  imperial  rescript  of  1882  called  for  unquestioning  loyalty  to 
the  emperor  by  the  new  armed  forces  and  asserted  that  commands 
from  superior  officers  were  equivalent  to  commands  from  the  em- 
peror himself.  Thenceforth,  the  military  existed  in  an  intimate  and 
privileged  relationship  with  the  imperial  institution.  Top-ranking 
military  leaders  were  given  direct  access  to  the  emperor  and  the 
authority  to  transmit  his  pronouncements  direcdy  to  the  troops.  The 
sympathetic  relationship  between  conscripts  and  officers,  particu- 
larly junior  officers,  who  were  drawn  mostly  from  the  peasantry, 
tended  to  draw  the  military  closer  to  the  people  (see  The  Meiji  Resto- 
ration, ch.  1).  In  time,  most  people  came  to  look  more  for  guidance 
in  national  matters  to  military  commanders  than  to  political  leaders. 

The  first  test  of  the  nation's  new  military  capabilities,  a  successful 
punitive  expedition  to  Taiwan  in  1874,  was  followed  by  a  series 
of  military  ventures  unmarred  by  defeat  until  World  War  II.  Japan 
moved  against  Korea,  China,  and  Russia,  to  secure  by  military 
means  the  raw  materials  and  strategic  territories  it  believed  neces- 
sary for  the  development  and  protection  of  the  homeland.  Territorial 
gains  were  achieved  in  Korea,  the  southern  half  of  Sakhalin  (re- 
named Karafuto),  and  Manchuria.  As  an  ally  of  Britain  in  World 
War  I,  Japan  assumed  control  over  Germany's  possessions  in  Asia, 
notably  in  China's  Shandong  Province,  and  the  Mariana,  Caro- 
line, and  Marshall  islands  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  (see  World  War  I, 
ch.  1). 

The  Naval  General  Staff,  independent  from  the  supreme  com- 
mand from  1893,  became  even  more  powerful  after  World  War  I. 
At  the  1921-22  Washington  Conference,  the  major  powers  signed 
the  Five  Power  Naval  Disarmament  Treaty,  which  set  the  interna- 
tional capital  ship  ratio  for  the  United  States,  Britain,  Japan,  France, 
and  Italy  at  5,  5,  3,  1.75,  and  1.75  respectively.  The  Imperial  Navy 
insisted  that  it  required  a  ratio  of  seven  ships  for  every  eight  United 
States  naval  ships,  but  settled  for  three  to  five,  a  ratio  acceptable 
to  the  Japanese  public  (see  Diplomacy,  ch.  1).  The  London  Naval 
Treaty  of  1930  brought  about  further  reduction  but,  by  the  end  of 
1935,  Japan  had  entered  a  period  of  unlimited  military  expansion 
and  ignored  its  previous  commitments.  By  the  late  1930s,  the  propor- 
tion of  Japanese  to  United  States  naval  forces  was  70.6  percent  in 
total  tonnage  and  94  percent  in  aircraft  carriers,  and  Japanese  ships 
slightly  outnumbered  those  of  the  United  States. 

World  War  II 

Establishment  of  Manchukuo 

The  power  of  the  military  grew  when,  in  September  1931,  without 
the  knowledge  or  approval  of  the  civil  government,  members  of  the 


424 


National  Security 


Imperial  Army  unit  stationed  in  Manchuria — the  Guandong,  or 
Kwantung,  Army — dynamited  a  short  section  of  the  South  Man- 
churian  Railway  near  Shenyang  (called  Mukden  by  the  Japanese). 
Blaming  the  incident  on  Chinese  saboteurs,  the  Guandong  Army 
declared  a  state  of  emergency  and  quickly  occupied  all  the  prin- 
cipal cities  in  the  region.  In  March  1932  this  army  formed  the  pup- 
pet state  of  Manchukuo  (see  Rise  of  the  Militarists,  ch.  1).  At  home, 
this  quick  and  inexpensive  victory  greatly  increased  the  confidence 
of  the  young  nationalist  officers,  who  could  rightly  claim  credit  for 
it,  but  other  officers  were  sobered  by  the  precedent  for  insubordi- 
nation. Their  apprehension  was  well  founded:  in  the  early  1930s 
a  series  of  assassinations  and  conspiracies  occurred  within  the  na- 
tion and  armed  forces.  In  1936  a  force  from  the  Tokyo  garrison 
rose  in  open  revolt.  Although  the  rebels  were  suppressed  on  orders 
of  the  emperor,  the  stage  was  set  for  more  radical  military  leaders 
to  assume  gradual  control  of  the  government,  a  process  that  was 
completed  by  1940  and  lasted  until  a  few  weeks  before  Japan's  1945 
surrender  in  World  War  II. 

Sino-Japanese  War 

On  July  17,  1937,  a  new  wave  of  expansion  on  the  Asian  main- 
land began  with  a  skirmish  between  Chinese  and  Japanese  troops 
at  Marco  Polo  Bridge  outside  of  Beiping  (now  Beijing).  Although 
the  Japanese  commander  had  committed  his  troops  without  prior 
knowledge  or  consent  of  the  government  in  Tokyo,  he  was  promptiy 
provided  with  reinforcements  by  the  general  staff,  which  by  this 
time  was  strongly  influenced  by  the  younger  officers.  The  fighting 
quickly  spread,  and  the  Second  Sino-Japanese  War  (1937-45)  had 
begun.  On  July  28  Chinese  forces  evacuated  Beiping.  Two  days 
later  the  Japanese  army  occupied  Tianjin,  and  on  August  13 
Japanese  forces  attacked  China's  financial  center,  Shanghai. 
Chinese  forces  resisted  for  three  months,  but  finally  succumbed 
to  the  better-armed  and  better-trained  Japanese  forces.  The  fall 
of  Shanghai  left  China's  capital,  Nanjing,  unprotected,  and  the 
Chinese  government  moved  its  capital  to  the  southwestern  moun- 
tain city  of  Chongqing.  Japanese  forces  quickly  occupied  Nan- 
jing, indiscriminately  massacring  about  100,000  civilians  in  the  in- 
famous "Rape  of  Nanjing."  In  mid- 1938  the  Japanese  set  their 
sights  on  the  central  Chinese  industrial  city  of  Wuhan.  Wuhan  held 
out  for  four  and  one-half  months,  but  finally  surrendered  on  De- 
cember 25,  1938.  The  fall  of  Wuhan,  coupled  with  the  earlier  fall 
of  Guangzhou  on  October  2 1 ,  left  most  urban  areas  in  central  and 
eastern  China  in  the  hands  of  the  Japanese.  To  the  north,  however, 


425 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


Japanese  forces  were  defeated  after  a  protracted  battle  with  a  joint 
Soviet-Mongolian  force  in  1939. 

At  home,  the  Japanese  armed  forces  were  portrayed  as  benevo- 
lent crusaders  striving  to  free  Asia  from  European  colonial  domi- 
nation. The  military's  control  over  almost  every  phase  of  Japanese 
life  was  by  now  complete,  and  opposition  to  its  policies  was  tanta- 
mount to  treason.  The  top  military  commanders  enjoyed  direct 
access  to  the  emperor,  bypassing  civilian  authority  completely. 

War  in  the  Pacific 

In  September  1940,  with  the  permission  of  the  pro-Nazi  Vichy 
government  of  France,  Japan  moved  into  northern  Indochina,  es- 
tablishing a  foothold  in  strategically  important  Southeast  Asia.  A 
few  days  later,  Japan  signed  a  mutual  defense  agreement,  the 
Tripartite  Pact,  with  Germany  and  Italy,  putting  it  on  a  collision 
course  with  the  United  States.  The  German  invasion  of  the  Soviet 
Union  in  June  1941  relieved  the  Japanese  of  the  Soviet  threat  in 
East  Asia.  As  a  result,  in  July  1941  Japan  decided  to  move  its  troops 
into  southern  Indochina  for  possible  operations  against  the  oil-rich 
Dutch  East  Indies.  The  United  States  responded  by  freezing 
Japanese  assets  in  the  United  States  and  imposing  an  oil  embargo 
on  Japan.  Britain,  the  British  Commonwealth  of  Nations  coun- 
tries, and  the  government  of  the  Dutch  East  Indies  quickly  followed 
suit,  cutting  90  percent  of  Japan's  oil  imports.  Faced  with  a  choice 
of  submitting  to  United  States  demands  for  a  return  to  the  pre- 1931 
status  quo  or  confronting  the  United  States,  Japan  determined  to 
strike  out  boldly.  Beginning  with  a  devastating  attack  against  the 
United  States  fleet  at  Pearl  Harbor,  Hawaii,  on  December  7,  1941, 
it  quickly  took  advantage  of  superior  air  and  naval  power  to  oc- 
cupy the  Philippines,  the  Dutch  East  Indies,  Malaya,  and  Singa- 
pore. An  overland  offensive  brought  Burma  and  Thailand  under 
Japanese  control,  and  a  string  of  amphibious  operations  established 
Japan's  control  of  the  South  Pacific.  By  mid- 1942  Japanese  forces 
appeared  to  be  in  control  of  most  of  their  objectives  (see  fig.  2). 

It  was  at  this  point  that  the  superior  economic  and  industrial 
power  of  the  United  States  began  to  turn  the  tide.  In  June  1942 
the  Japanese  directed  the  bulk  of  their  navy  to  Midway,  a  tiny  atoll 
at  the  northern  tip  of  the  Hawaiian  chain,  expecting  to  destroy  the 
rest  of  the  United  States  Pacific  fleet.  Instead,  the  Americans,  fore- 
warned of  the  attack,  used  carrier-based  aircraft  to  devastate  the 
Japanese  fleet.  The  United  States  counteroffensive  had  begun.  In 
the  South  Pacific,  after  six  months  of  heavy  fighting,  Japanese  forces 
evacuated  Guadalcanal  in  February  1943.  From  there,  revitalized 
United  States  and  Allied  forces  retook  most  of  the  South  Pacific 


426

islands  occupied  by  the  overextended  Japanese  forces.  By  June 
1944,  United  States  and  Allied  forces  had  reached  Saipan,  in  the 
Mariana  Islands,  putting  their  bombers  within  range  of  the  Japanese 
homeland. 

When  United  States  air,  ground,  and  sea  power  began  to  reverse 
the  tide  of  Japanese  victories,  the  authority  of  the  Japanese  forces 
began  to  wane  in  the  captured  territories.  At  home  in  Japan, 
however,  respect  remained  high  until  intensive  United  States  ae- 
rial bombardment  there  raised  popular  doubt  about  the  military's 
ability  to  win  the  war.  It  was  not  until  the  last  days  of  the  war, 
after  the  United  States  had  dropped  atomic  bombs  on  Hiroshima 
and  Nagasaki,  that  the  emperor,  in  an  unprecedented  political  act, 
compelled  the  general  staff  to  accept  the  terms  for  surrender. 

The  Self-Defense  Forces 

Japan's  defeat  in  World  War  II,  the  only  major  military  defeat 
in  the  country's  history,  had  a  profound  and  lasting  effect  on  na- 
tional attitudes  toward  war,  the  armed  forces,  and  military  involve- 
ment in  politics.  These  attitudes  were  immediately  apparent  in  the 
public's  willing  acceptance  of  total  disarmament  and  demobiliza- 
tion after  the  war  and  in  the  alacrity  with  which  all  military  lead- 
ers were  removed  from  positions  of  influence  in  the  state.  Under 


427 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

General  Douglas  MacArthur  of  the  United  States  Army,  serving 
as  the  Supreme  Commander  of  the  Allied  Powers,  and  in  concert 
with  the  wishes  of  most  Japanese,  occupation  authorities  were  com- 
mitted to  the  demilitarization  and  democratization  of  the  nation. 
All  clubs,  schools,  and  societies  associated  with  the  military  and 
martial  skills  were  eliminated.  The  general  staff  was  abolished,  along 
with  army  and  navy  ministries  and  the  Imperial  Army  and  Im- 
perial Navy.  Industry  serving  the  military  also  was  dismantled. 

The  trauma  of  defeat  produced  strong  pacifist  sentiments  that 
found  expression  in  the  United  States-fostered  1947  Constitution, 
which  forever  renounces  war  as  an  instrument  for  setding  interna- 
tional disputes  and  declares  that  Japan  will  never  again  maintain 
"land,  sea,  or  air  forces  or  other  war  potential"  (see  The  Postwar 
Constitution,  ch.  6).  Later  cabinets  interpreted  these  provisions  as 
not  denying  the  nation  the  right  to  self-defense  and,  with  the  en- 
couragement of  the  United  States,  developed  the  SDF.  Antimilitarist 
public  opinion,  however,  remained  a  force  to  be  reckoned  with  on 
any  defense-related  issue.  The  constitutional  legitimacy  of  the  SDF 
was  challenged  well  into  the  1970s,  and  even  in  the  1980s  govern- 
ment acted  warily  on  defense  matters  lest  residual  antimilitarism 
be  aggravated  and  a  backlash  result. 

Early  Development 

Deprived  of  any  military  capability  after  1945,  the  nation  had 
only  occupation  forces  and  a  few  domestic  police  on  which  to  rely 
for  security.  Rising  Cold  War  tensions  in  Europe  and  Asia,  cou- 
pled with  leftist-inspired  strikes  and  demonstrations  in  Japan, 
prompted  some  conservative  leaders  to  question  the  unilateral 
renunciation  of  all  military  capability.  These  sentiments  were  in- 
tensified in  1950  when  most  occupation  troops  were  transferred 
to  the  Korean  War  (1950-53)  theater,  leaving  Japan  virtually  help- 
less to  counter  internal  disruption  and  subversion,  and  very  much 
aware  of  the  need  to  enter  into  a  mutual  defense  relationship  with 
the  United  States  to  guarantee  the  nation's  external  security.  En- 
couraged by  the  occupation  authorities,  the  Japanese  government 
in  July  1950  authorized  the  establishment  of  the  National  Police 
Reserve,  consisting  of  75,000  men  equipped  with  light  infantry 
weapons. 

Under  the  terms  of  the  Mutual  Security  Assistance  Pact,  rati- 
fied in  1952  along  with  the  peace  treaty  Japan  had  signed  with  the 
United  States  and  other  countries,  United  States  forces  stationed 
in  Japan  were  to  deal  with  external  aggression  against  Japan  while 
Japanese  forces,  both  ground  and  maritime,  would  deal  with  in- 
ternal threats  and  natural  disasters.  Accordingly,  in  mid- 1952  the 


428 


National  Security 


National  Police  Reserve  was  expanded  to  1 10,000  men  and  named 
the  National  Safety  Force.  The  Coastal  Safety  Force,  which  had 
been  organized  in  1950  as  a  waterborne  counterpart  to  the  Na- 
tional Police  Reserve,  was  transferred  with  it  to  the  National  Safety 
Agency  to  constitute  an  embryonic  navy  (see  Military  Relations 
with  the  United  States,  this  ch.). 

As  Japan  perceived  a  growing  external  threat  without  adequate 
forces  to  counter  it,  the  National  Safety  Force  underwent  further 
development  that  entailed  difficult  political  problems.  The  war  re- 
nunciation clause  of  the  Constitution  was  the  basis  for  strong  po- 
litical objections  to  any  sort  of  force  other  than  conventional  police. 
In  1954,  however,  separate  land,  sea,  and  air  forces  for  purely  defen- 
sive purposes  were  created,  subject  to  the  Office  of  the  Prime 
Minister  (see  The  Cabinet  and  Ministries,  ch.  6). 

To  avoid  the  appearance  of  a  revival  of  militarism,  Japan's  lead- 
ers emphasized  constitutional  guarantees  of  civilian  control  of  the 
government  and  armed  forces  and  used  nonmilitary  terms  for  the 
organization  and  functions  of  the  forces.  The  overall  organization 
was  called  the  Defense  Agency  rather  than  the  Ministry  of  Defense. 
The  armed  forces  were  designated  the  Ground  Self-Defense  Force 
(GSDF),  the  Maritime  Self-Defense  Force  (MSDF),  and  the  Air 
Self-Defense  Force  (ASDF),  instead  of  the  army,  navy,  and  air 
force. 

Although  possession  of  nuclear  weapons  is  not  forbidden  in  the 
Constitution,  Japan,  as  the  only  nation  to  experience  the  devasta- 
tion of  atomic  attack,  early  expressed  its  abhorrence  of  nuclear  arms 
and  determined  never  to  acquire  them.  The  Basic  Atomic  Energy 
Law  of  1956  limits  research,  development,  and  utilization  of  nuclear 
power  to  peaceful  uses,  and  from  1956  national  policy  has  embod- 
ied "three  non-nuclear  principles" — forbidding  the  nation  to  pos- 
sess or  manufacture  nuclear  weapons  or  to  allow  them  to  be 
introduced  into  the  nation.  In  1976  Japan  ratified  the  Treaty  on 
the  Non-Proliferation  of  Nuclear  Weapons  (adopted  by  the  United 
Nations  Security  Council  in  1968)  and  reiterated  its  intention  never 
to  develop,  use,  or  allow  the  transportation  of  nuclear  weapons 
through  its  territory. 

Strategic  Considerations 

The  expansion  of  military  capabilities  in  the  Soviet  Far  East  be- 
ginning in  1970  was  of  grave  concern  to  Japan,  and  Japanese 
authorities  regularly  monitored  the  activities  of  the  Soviet  Pacific 
fleet  and  Soviet  aircraft  in  the  waters  and  air  space  around  Japan. 
Despite  a  general  lessening  of  world  tensions  and  Soviet  overtures 
for  improved  bilateral  relations,  in  1990  the  Soviet  Union  still

maintained  a  variety  of  units,  including  a  division  headquarters, 
on  the  southernmost  Kuril  Islands  claimed  by  Japan  as  its  North- 
ern Territories.  The  Soviet  Union  also  operated  about  100  major 
surface  war  ships  and  140  submarines  (about  75  nuclear  powered) 
out  of  Vladivostok  and  other  Pacific  ports.  Soviet  naval  combat- 
ants had  passed  through  the  Soya,  Tsugaru,  and  Korea  straits  and 
had  sailed  in  the  Sea  of  Japan  and  the  Sea  of  Okhotsk  and  in  Pa- 
cific Ocean  areas  adjacent  to  Japan  (see  fig.  1).  Japan  also  was 
within  range  of  Tu-22M  Backfire  bombers  and  sea-  and  air- 
launched  cruise  missiles  and  tactical  nuclear  weapons  based  in  the 
Soviet  Union. 

Another  area  of  strategic  interest  to  the  nation  was  the  Korean 
Peninsula.  The  Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea  (North 
Korea)  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea)  had  remained 
implacable  enemies  since  the  Korean  War,  and  in  1990  the  bor- 
der between  them  was  one  of  the  most  heavily  fortified  in  the  world. 
Stable  and  peaceful  relations  between  the  two  were  considered  vital 
to  Japan's  interest:  an  outbreak  of  hostilities  would  involve  United 
States  forces  stationed  in  Japan,  presenting  political  and  possibly 
security  problems  for  the  nation,  in  addition  to  interrupting  flourish- 
ing trade  with  South  Korea.  Although  Japan  maintained  formal 
diplomatic  relations  only  with  South  Korea,  it  had  refused  to  con- 
tribute to  that  nation's  defense,  stating  that  any  aid  to  a  foreign 
military  establishment  would  violate  its  own  Constitution. 

Events  on  the  Asian  mainland  could  also  affect  Japan.  From  the 
early  1970s,  China  possessed  a  nuclear  force  capable  of  striking 
Japan  and  a  large  standing  army  and  substantial  navy,  even  if  the 
latter  were  geared  primarily  to  coastal  defense.  China  itself  was 
unlikely  to  present  a  direct  military  threat  to  Japan,  but  Chinese 
internal  unrest  or  China's  conflicts  with  its  neighbors  could  have 
an  indirect  impact  on  Japanese  security  and  trade  (see  Trade  and 
Investment  Relations,  ch.  5). 

The  nation  was  vitally  dependent  on  maintaining  access  to  re- 
gional and  worldwide  shipping  lanes  and  fishing  areas,  but  it  was 
incapable  of  defending  the  sea  routes  on  which  it  relied.  Its  energy 
supplies  came  primarily  from  Middle  Eastern  sources,  and  its 
tankers  had  to  pass  through  the  Indian  Ocean,  the  Strait  of  Malacca, 
and  the  South  China  Sea,  making  them  vulnerable  to  hostilities 
in  Southeast  Asia.  Vulnerability  to  interception  of  oceangoing  trade 
remained  the  country's  greatest  strategic  weakness.  Efforts  to  over- 
come this  weakness,  beginning  with  Prime  Minister  Suzuki  Zenko's 
statement  in  May  1981  that  Japan  would  attempt  to  defend  its  sea 
lines  of  communication  (SLOC)  to  a  distance  of  1,000  nautical 
miles,  met  with  controversy.  Within  the  Defense  Agency  itself,  some 


430 


National  Security 


viewed  a  role  for  the  MSDF  in  defending  the  SLOC  as  "unrealis- 
tic, unauthorized,  and  impossible,"  Even  the  strongest  support- 
ers of  this  program  allowed  that  constitutional  and  other  legal 
restrictions  would  limit  active  participation  of  the  MSDF  to  cases 
where  Japan  was  under  direct  attack.  Japan  could,  however,  pro- 
vide surveillance  assistance,  intelligence  sharing,  and  search  and 
rescue  support  to  United  States  naval  forces. 

Japan's  small  size,  its  geographically  concentrated  industry,  and 
the  close  proximity  of  potentially  hostile  powers  all  rendered  the 
country  vulnerable  to  a  major  nuclear  strike.  As  for  defense  against 
conventional  aggression,  strategy  was  determined  by  the  nation's 
elongated  insular  geography,  its  mountainous  terrain,  and  the  near- 
ness of  the  Asian  mainland.  The  terrain  favors  local  defense  against 
invasion  by  ground  forces,  but  protection  of  the  approximately 
15,800  kilometer  coastiine  of  the  four  main  islands  would  present 
unique  problems  in  the  event  of  a  large-scale  invasion.  Potentially 
hostile  aircraft  and  missile  bases  were  so  close  that  timely  warning 
even  by  radar  facilities  might  be  difficult  to  obtain. 

Maneuver  space  was  limited  to  such  an  extent  that  ground 
defenses  would  have  to  be  virtually  in  place  at  the  onset  of  hostili- 
ties. No  point  of  the  country  is  more  than  150  kilometers  from  the 
sea.  Moreover,  the  straits  separating  Honshu  from  the  other  main 
islands  restrict  the  rapid  movement  of  troops  from  one  island  to 
another,  even  though  all  major  islands  are  now  connected  by  bridges 
and  tunnels.  Within  each  island,  mountain  barriers  and  narrow 
roads  restrict  troop  and  supply  movements.  The  key  strategic  region 
was  densely  populated  and  highly  industrialized  central  Honshu, 
particularly  the  area  from  Tokyo  to  Kobe  (see  Physical  Setting, 
ch.  2). 

Place  in  National  Life 

The  Defense  Agency,  aware  that  it  could  not  accomplish  its  pro- 
grams without  popular  support,  paid  close  attention  to  public  opin- 
ion. Although  the  people  retained  a  lingering  suspicion  of  the  armed 
services,  in  the  late  1980s  antimilitarism  had  moderated,  compared 
to  its  form  in  the  early  1950s  when  the  SDF  was  established.  At 
that  time,  fresh  from  the  terrible  defeat  of  World  War  II,  most 
people  had  ceased  to  believe  that  the  military  could  maintain  peace 
or  serve  the  national  interest.  By  the  mid-1970s,  memories  of  World 
War  II  had  faded,  and  a  growing  number  of  people  believed  that 
Japan's  military  and  diplomatic  roles  should  reflect  its  rapidly  grow- 
ing economic  strength.  At  the  same  time,  United  States-Soviet  stra- 
tegic contention  in  the  area  around  Japan  had  increased.  In  1976 
Defense  Agency  Director  General  Sakata  Michita  called  upon  the 


431 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

cabinet  to  adopt  the  National  Defense  Program  Outline  to  improve 
the  quality  of  the  armed  forces  and  more  clearly  define  their  strictly 
defensive  role.  For  this  program  to  gain  acceptance,  Sakata  had  to 
agree  to  a  ceiling  on  military  expenditures  of  1  percent  of  the  gross 
national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  and  a  prohibition  on  export- 
ing weapons  and  military  technology.  The  outiine  was  adopted  by 
the  cabinet  and,  according  to  public  opinion  polls,  was  approved 
by  approximately  60  percent  of  the  people.  Throughout  the  re- 
mainder of  the  1970s  and  into  the  1980s,  the  quality  of  the  SDF 
improved  and  public  approval  of  the  improved  forces  went  up. 

In  November  1982,  when  the  Defense  Agency's  former  direc- 
tor general,  Nakasone  Yasuhiro,  became  prime  minister,  he  was 
under  strong  pressure  from  the  United  States  and  other  Western 
nations  to  move  toward  a  more  assertive  defense  policy  in  line  with 
Japan's  status  as  a  major  world  economic  and  political  power. 
Strong  antimilitarist  sentiment  remained  in  Japanese  public  opin- 
ion, however,  especially  in  the  opposition  parties.  Nakasone  chose 
a  compromise  solution,  gradually  building  up  the  SDF  and  stead- 
ily increasing  defense  spending  while  guarding  against  being  drawn 
beyond  self-defense  into  collective  security.  In  1985  he  developed 
the  Mid-Term  Defense  Estimate  (see  Missions,  this  ch.).  Although 
that  program  had  general  public  backing,  its  goals  could  not  be 
met  while  retaining  the  ceiling  of  1  percent  of  GNP  on  military 
spending,  which  still  had  strong  public  support.  At  first  the  govern- 
ment tried  to  get  around  the  problem  by  deferring  payment,  bud- 
geting only  the  initial  costs  of  major  military  hardware.  But  by  late 
1986,  it  had  become  obvious  that  the  1  percent  ceiling  had  to  be 
superseded.  Thus,  on  January  24,  1987,  in  an  extraordinary  night 
meeting,  the  cabinet  abandoned  this  ceiling.  A  March  1987  Asahi 
Shimbun  poll  indicated  that  this  move  was  made  in  defiance  of  public 
opinion:  only  15  percent  approved  the  removal  of  the  ceiling  and 
61  percent  disapproved.  But  a  January  1988  poll  conducted  by  the 
Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  reported  that  58  percent  approved 
the  defense  budget  of  1 .004  percent  of  GNP  for  Fiscal  Year  (FY — 
see  Glossary)  1987. 

During  1987  the  Japanese  government  reviewed  ways  in  which 
it  could  assist  friendly  forces  in  protecting  shipping  in  the  Persian 
Gulf.  Several  possibilities  were  seriously  considered,  including  send- 
ing minesweepers  to  the  gulf.  But,  in  the  end,  the  government  de- 
termined that  sending  any  military  forces  to  the  gulf  would  be 
unacceptable  to  the  Japanese  people.  Instead  the  Japanese  govern- 
ment agreed  to  fund  the  installation  of  radio  navigation  guides  for 
gulf  shipping.

Appreciation  of  the  SDF  continued  to  grow  in  the  1980s,  with 
over  half  of  the  respondents  in  a  1988  survey  voicing  an  interest 
in  the  SDF  and  over  76  percent  indicating  that  they  were  favor- 
ably impressed.  Although  the  majority  (63.5  percent)  of  respondents 
were  aware  that  the  primary  purpose  of  the  SDF  was  maintenance 
of  national  security,  an  even  greater  number  (77  percent)  saw  dis- 
aster relief  as  the  most  useful  SDF  function.  The  SDF  therefore 
continued  to  devote  much  of  its  time  and  resources  to  disaster  relief 
and  other  civic  action.  Between  1984  and  1988,  at  the  request  of 
prefectural  governors,  the  SDF  assisted  in  approximately  3,100  dis- 
aster relief  operations,  involving  about  138,000  personnel,  16,000 
vehicles,  5,300  aircraft,  and  120  ships  and  small  craft.  In  addition, 
the  SDF  participated  in  earthquake  disaster  prevention  operations 
and  disposed  of  a  large  quantity  of  World  War  II  explosive  ord- 
nance, especially  in  Okinawa.  The  forces  also  participated  in  public 
works  projects,  cooperated  in  managing  athletic  events,  took  part 
in  annual  Antarctic  expeditions,  and  conducted  aerial  surveys  to 
report  on  ice  conditions  for  fishermen  and  on  geographic  forma- 
tions for  construction  projects.  Especially  sensitive  to  maintaining 
harmonious  relations  with  communities  close  to  defense  bases,  the 
SDF  built  new  roads,  irrigation  networks,  and  schools  in  those 
areas.  Soundproofing  was  installed  in  homes  and  public  buildings

near  airfields.  Despite  these  measures,  in  some  areas  local  resistance 
to  military  installations  remained  strong. 

Missions 

Despite  the  nation's  status  as  a  major  world  power,  Japan  es- 
chewed responsibility  for  regional  defense.  Having  renounced  war, 
the  possession  of  war  potential,  the  right  of  belligerency,  and  the 
possession  of  nuclear  weaponry,  it  held  the  view  that  it  should  pos- 
sess only  the  minimum  defense  necessary  to  face  external  threats. 
Within  those  limits,  the  Self-Defense  Forces  Law  of  1954  provides 
the  basis  from  which  various  formulations  of  SDF  missions  have 
been  derived.  The  law  states  that  ground,  maritime,  and  air  forces 
are  to  preserve  the  peace  and  independence  of  the  nation  and  to 
maintain  national  security  by  conducting  operations  on  land,  at 
sea,  and  in  the  air  to  defend  the  nation  against  direct  and  indirect 
aggression. 

The  general  framework  through  which  these  missions  are  to  be 
accomplished  was  set  forth  in  the  Basic  Policy  for  National  Defense 
adopted  by  the  cabinet  in  1957;  it  remained  in  force  in  1990.  Ac- 
cording to  this  document,  the  nation's  security  would  be  achieved 
by  supporting  the  United  Nations  (UN)  and  promoting  interna- 
tional cooperation,  by  stabilizing  domestic  affairs  and  enhancing 
public  welfare,  by  gradually  developing  an  effective  self-defense 
capability,  and  by  dealing  with  external  aggression  on  the  basis 
of  Japan-United  States  security  arrangements,  pending  the  effec- 
tive functioning  of  the  UN. 

The  very  general  terms  in  which  military  missions  were  couched 
left  specifics  open  to  wide  interpretation  and  prompted  the  criti- 
cism that  the  nation  did  not  possess  a  military  strategy.  In  the  1976 
National  Defense  Program  Outline,  the  cabinet  sought  to  define 
missions  more  specifically  by  setting  guidelines  for  the  nation's  read- 
iness, including  specific  criteria  for  the  maintenance  and  opera- 
tion of  the  SDF.  Under  these  guidelines,  in  cases  of  limited  and 
small-scale  attack,  Japanese  forces  would  respond  promptly  to  con- 
trol the  situation.  If  enemy  forces  attacked  in  greater  strength  than 
Japan  could  counter  alone,  the  SDF  would  engage  the  attacker  until 
the  United  States  could  come  to  its  aid.  Against  nuclear  threat, 
Japan  would  rely  on  the  nuclear  deterrence  of  the  United  States. 
To  accomplish  its  missions,  the  SDF  would  maintain  surveillance, 
be  prepared  to  respond  to  direct  and  indirect  attacks,  be  capable 
of  providing  command,  communication,  logistics,  and  training  sup- 
port, and  be  available  to  aid  in  disaster  relief. 

The  outline  specified  quotas  of  personnel  and  equipment  that 
were  deemed  necessary  for  each  force  to  meet  its  tasks.  Particular 


434 


National  Security 


elements  of  each  force's  mission  were  also  identified.  The  GSDF 
was  to  defend  against  ground  invasion  and  threats  to  internal  secu- 
rity, be  able  to  deploy  to  any  part  of  the  nation,  and  protect  the 
bases  of  all  three  services  of  the  Self-Defense  Forces.  The  MSDF 
was  to  meet  invasion  by  sea,  guard  and  defend  coastal  waters,  ports, 
bays,  and  major  straits,  sweep  mines,  and  patrol  and  survey  the  sur- 
rounding waters.  The  ASDF  was  to  render  aircraft  and  missile  in- 
terceptor capability,  provide  support  fighter  units  for  maritime  and 
ground  operations,  supply  air  reconnaissance  and  air  transport  for 
all  forces,  and  maintain  airborne  and  stationary  early  warning  units. 

The  Mid-Term  Defense  Estimate  for  FY  1986  through  FY  1990 
envisioned  a  modernized  SDF  with  an  expanded  role.  While  main- 
taining Japan-United  States  security  arrangements  and  the  exclu- 
sively defensive  policy  mandated  by  the  Constitution,  this  program 
undertook  moderate  improvements  in  Japanese  defense  capabili- 
ties. Among  its  specific  objectives  were  bettering  air  defense  by 
improving  and  modernizing  interceptor-fighter  aircraft  and  surface- 
to-air  missiles,  improving  antisubmarine  warfare  capability  with 
additional  destroyers  and  fixed- wing  antisubmarine  patrol  aircraft, 
and  upgrading  intelligence,  reconnaissance,  and  command,  con- 
trol, and  communications. 

The  SDF  disaster  relief  role  is  defined  in  Article  83  of  the  Self- 
Defense  Forces  Law  of  1954,  requiring  units  to  respond  to  calls 
for  assistance  from  prefectural  governors  to  aid  in  fire  fighting, 
earthquake  disasters,  searches  for  missing  persons,  rescues,  and 
reinforcement  of  embankments  and  levees  in  the  event  of  flood- 
ing. As  of  1990,  the  SDF  had  not  been  used  in  police  actions  nor 
was  it  likely  to  be  assigned  any  internal  security  tasks  in  the  future. 

Organization,  Training,  and  Equipment 

Based  on  the  Self-Defense  Forces  Law  of  1954,  the  nation's 
defense  establishment  was  organized  to  ensure  civilian  control  of 
the  armed  forces.  The  result  has  been  a  unique  military  system. 
All  SDF  personnel  were  technically  civilians:  those  in  uniform  were 
classified  as  special  civil  servants  and  were  subordinate  to  the 
ordinary  civil  servants  who  ran  the  Defense  Agency.  There  was 
no  military  secrets  law,  and  offenses  committed  by  military  per- 
sonnel— whether  on  base  or  off  base,  on  duty  or  off  duty,  of  mili- 
tary or  nonmilitary  nature — were  all  adjudicated  under  normal 
procedures  by  civil  courts  in  appropriate  jurisdictions  (see  The 
Criminal  Justice  System,  this  ch.). 

The  Defense  Agency 

In  1990  the  Defense  Agency,  as  part  of  the  Office  of  the  Prime 
Minister,  was  required  by  Article  66  of  the  Constitution  to  be 


435 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

completely  subordinate  to  civilian  authority.  Its  head,  the  director 
general,  had  the  rank  of  minister  of  state.  He  was  assisted  by  two 
vice  directors  general  (vice  ministers),  one  parliamentary  and  one 
administrative;  the  Defense  Facilities  Office;  and  the  Internal 
Bureaus  (see  fig.  12).  The  highest  figure  in  the  command  struc- 
ture was  the  prime  minister,  who  was  responsible  directly  to  the 
Diet  (see  Glossary;  The  Legislature,  ch.  6).  In  a  national  emer- 
gency, the  prime  minister  was  authorized  to  order  the  various  com- 
ponents of  the  Self-Defense  Forces  into  action,  subject  to  the  consent 
of  the  Diet.  In  times  of  extreme  emergency,  that  approval  might 
be  obtained  after  the  fact. 

In  July  1986,  the  Security  Council  was  established.  The  council 
was  presided  over  by  the  prime  minister  and  included  the  ministers 
of  state  specified  in  advance  in  Article  9  of  the  Cabinet  Law,  the 
foreign  minister,  the  finance  minister,  the  chief  cabinet  secretary, 
the  chairman  of  the  National  Public  Safety  Commission,  the  director 
general  of  the  Defense  Agency,  and  the  director  general  of  the  Eco- 
nomic Planning  Agency.  The  chairman  of  the  Security  Council 
also  could  invite  the  chairman  of  the  Joint  Staff  Council  and  any 
other  relevant  state  minister  or  official  to  attend.  Replacing  the 
National  Defense  Council,  which  had  acted  as  an  advisory  group 
on  defense-related  matters  since  1956,  the  Security  Council  ad- 
dressed a  wider  range  of  military  and  nonmilitary  security  issues, 
including  basic  national  defense  policy,  the  National  Defense  Pro- 
gram Outline,  the  outline  on  coordinating  industrial  production 
and  other  matters  related  to  the  National  Defense  Program  Out- 
line, and  decisions  on  diplomatic  initiatives  and  defense  operations. 

The  internal  bureaus,  especially  the  Bureau  of  Defense  Policy, 
Bureau  of  the  Finance,  and  the  Bureau  of  Equipment,  were  often 
headed  by  officials  from  other  ministries  and  were  the  main  centers 
of  power  and  instruments  of  civilian  control  in  the  Defense  Agency. 
The  Bureau  of  Defense  Policy  was  responsible  for  drafting  defense 
policy  and  programs,  for  determining  day-to-day  operational  ac- 
tivities, and  for  information  gathering  and  analysis  in  the  SDF. 
The  Bureau  of  Finance  was  instrumental  in  developing  the  Defense 
Agency  budget  and  in  establishing  spending  priorities  for  the 
Defense  Agency  and  the  SDF.  The  Bureau  of  Equipment,  organized 
into  subunits  for  each  of  the  military  services,  focused  on  equip- 
ment procurement.  Before  any  major  purchase  was  recommended 
to  the  Diet  by  the  Defense  Agency,  it  had  to  be  reviewed  by  each 
of  these  important  bureaus. 

Below  these  civilian  groups  was  the  uniformed  SDF.  In  1990 
its  senior  officer  was  the  chairman  of  the  Joint  Staff  Council,  a  body 
that  included  the  chiefs  of  staff  of  the  ground,  maritime,  and  air 


436 


National  Security 


arms  of  the  Self-Defense  Forces.  Its  principal  functions  were  to  ad- 
vise the  director  general  and  to  plan  and  execute  joint  exercises. 
The  three  branches  maintained  staff  offices  to  manage  operations 
in  their  branches.  Although  rank  established  echelons  of  command 
within  the  SDF,  all  three  branches  were  immediately  responsible 
to  the  director  general  and  were  coequal  bodies  with  the  Joint  Staff 
Council  and  the  three  staff  offices. 

This  structure  precluded  the  concentration  of  power  of  the 
pre- 1945  general  staffs,  but  it  impeded  interservice  coordination, 
and  there  were  few  formal  exchanges  among  commanders  from 
various  branches.  Moreover,  some  dissatisfaction  was  reported  by 
high-ranking  officers  who  felt  they  had  little  power  compared  with 
younger  civilian  officials  in  the  bureaus,  who  most  often  had  no 
military  experience.  To  rectify  this  situation  and  to  increase  input 
by  the  SDF  in  policy  matters,  in  the  early  1980s  the  Joint  Staff 
Council  was  enlarged  to  establish  better  lines  of  communication 
between  the  internal  bureaus  and  the  three  staff  offices.  A  com- 
puterized central  command  and  communications  system  and 
various  tactical  command  and  communications  systems  were 
established,  linking  service  and  field  headquarters  with  general 
headquarters  at  the  Defense  Agency  and  with  one  another. 

In  the  1980s,  efforts  were  also  under  way  to  facilitate  a  clear  and 
efficient  command  policy  in  the  event  of  a  crisis.  The  government 
stood  by  the  principle  that  military  action  was  permitted  only  under 
civilian  control,  but  in  recognition  that  delay  for  consultation  might 
prove  dangerous,  ships  of  the  MSDF  began  to  be  armed  with  live 
torpedoes,  and  fighter- interceptors  were  allowed  to  carry  missiles 
at  all  times.  Although  aircraft  had  long  been  allowed  to  force  down 
intruders  without  waiting  for  permission  from  the  prime  minister, 
ships  were  still  required  to  receive  specific  orders  before  interdict- 
ing invading  vessels.  The  Defense  Agency  had  recommended  draw- 
ing up  more  complete  guidelines  to  clarify  what  action  SDF  combat 
units  could  take  in  emergencies. 

Cooperation  between  the  SDF  and  other  civilian  agencies  in  con- 
tingency planning  was  limited.  No  plans  existed  to  ensure  the  sup- 
port of  civilian  aircraft  and  merchant  fleets  in  times  of  crisis,  even 
though  the  SDF  transportation  capabilities  were  generally  judged 
inadequate.  In  1990  legislation  was  being  studied  to  provide  the 
SDF  with  the  ability  to  respond  in  emergency  situations  not  spe- 
cifically covered  by  Article  76  of  the  Self-Defense  Forces  Law. 

SDF  training  included  instilling  a  sense  of  mission.  Personnel 
were  provided  with  the  scientific  and  technical  education  to  oper- 
ate and  maintain  modern  equipment  and  with  the  physical  train- 
ing necessary  to  accomplish  their  missions.

Modern  equipment  was  gradually  replacing  obsolescent  materiel 
in  the  SDF.  In  1987  the  Defense  Agency  replaced  its  communica- 
tions system  (which  formerly  had  relied  on  telephone  lines  of  the 
Nippon  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Corporation)  with  a  microwave 
network  incorporating  a  three-dimensional  transmission  system 
using  a  communications  satellite.  Despite  efforts  to  increase  stocks, 
however,  supplies  of  ammunition  and  maintenance  and  repair  parts 
in  1990  remained  at  less  than  satisfactory  levels. 

The  Ground  Self-Defense  Force 

The  largest  of  the  three  services,  the  GSDF,  operated  under  the 
command  of  the  chief  of  the  ground  staff,  based  in  the  city  of 
Ichikawa,  east  of  Tokyo.  Although  allotted  180,000  slots  for 
uniformed  personnel,  in  1989  the  force  was  maintained  at  about 
86  percent  of  that  level  (with  approximately  156,200  personnel), 
because  of  funding  constraints.  The  GSDF  consisted  of  one  armored 
division,  twelve  infantry  divisions,  one  airborne  brigade,  two  com- 
bined brigades,  one  training  brigade,  one  artillery  brigade  with 
four  groups,  eight  antiaircraft  artillery  groups,  one  helicopter 
brigade  with  twenty-four  squardrons,  and  two  antitank  helicopter 
squadrons,  with  a  third  being  formed,  and  five  engineer  brigades 
(see  table  38,  Appendix). 

In  1989  the  GSDF  was  divided  into  five  regional  armies,  each 
containing  two  to  four  divisions,  antiaircraft  artillery  units,  and 
support  units  (see  fig.  13).  The  largest,  the  Northern  Army,  was 
headquartered  on  Hokkaido,  where  population  and  geographic  con- 
straints were  less  limiting  than  elsewhere.  It  had  four  divisions  and 
artillery,  antiaircraft  artillery,  and  engineering  brigades.  The  North- 
eastern and  Eastern  armies,  headquartered  in  Sendai  and  Ichikawa, 
respectively,  each  had  two  divisions,  and  the  Central  Army,  head- 
quartered in  Itami,  had  three  divisions  in  addition  to  a  combined 
brigade  located  on  Shikoku.  The  Western  Army,  with  two  divi- 
sions, was  headquartered  at  Kengun  and  maintained  a  combined 
brigade  on  Okinawa. 

Intended  to  deter  attack,  repulse  a  small  invasion,  or  provide 
a  holding  action  until  reinforced  by  United  States  armed  forces, 
the  ground  element  in  1990  was  neither  equipped  nor  staffed  to 
offer  more  than  a  show  of  conventional  defense  by  itself.  Antitank 
artillery,  ground- to- sea  firepower,  and  mobility  were  being  im- 
proved and  surface-to-ship  missiles  were  being  acquired  in  the  Mid- 
Term  Defense  Program  scheduled  for  completion  in  FY  1990  (see 
table  39,  Appendix).  The  number  of  uniformed  personnel  was  in- 
sufficient to  enable  an  immediate  shift  onto  emergency  footing.  In- 
stead, the  ratio  of  officers  to  enlisted  personnel  was  high,  requiring

augmentation  by  reserves  or  volunteers  in  times  of  crisis.  In  late 
1989,  however,  GSDF  reserve  personnel,  numbering  48,000,  had 
received  little  professional  training. 

In  1989  basic  training  for  lower- secondary  and  upper- secondary 
school  graduates  began  in  the  training  brigade  and  lasted  approx- 
imately three  months.  Specialized  enlisted  and  noncommissioned 
officer  (NCO)  candidate  courses  were  available  in  branch  schools, 
and  qualified  NCOs  could  enter  an  eight-to-twelve-week  second 
lieutenant  candidate  program.  Senior  NCOs  and  graduates  of  an 
eighty- week  NCO  pilot  course  were  eligible  to  enter  officer  candi- 
date schools,  as  were  graduates  of  the  National  Defense  Academy 
at  Yokosuka  and  of  four-year  universities.  Advanced  technical, 
flight,  medical,  and  command  staff  officer  courses  were  also  run 
by  the  GSDF.  Like  the  maritime  and  air  forces,  the  GSDF  ran 
a  youth  cadet  program  offering  technical  training  to  lower-secondary 
school  graduates  below  military  age  in  return  for  a  promise  of  en- 
listment. 

Because  of  population  density  on  the  Japanese  islands,  only  lim- 
ited areas  were  available  for  large-scale  training  and,  even  in  these 
areas,  noise  restrictions  were  a  problem  (see  Population,  ch.  2). 
The  GSDF  tried  to  adapt  to  these  conditions  by  conducting  com- 
mand post  exercises  and  map  maneuvers  and  by  using  simulators 
and  other  training  devices.  In  live  firing  during  training,  propel- 
lants  were  reduced  to  shorten  shell  ranges.  Such  restriction 
diminished  the  value  of  combat  training  and  troop  morale. 

The  Maritime  Self-Defense  Force 

The  MSDF  had  an  authorized  strength  in  1989  of  46,000  and 
maintained  some  44,400  personnel  and  operated  149  major  com- 
batants, including  14  submarines,  56  destroyers  and  frigates,  47 
mine  warfare  vessels,  14  patrol  craft,  and  6  amphibious  ships.  It 
also  flew  some  181  fixed-wing  aircraft  and  102  helicopters.  Most 
of  these  aircraft  were  used  in  antisubmarine  and  mine  warfare  oper- 
ations. 

The  MSDF  was  commanded  by  the  chief  of  the  maritime  staff 
and  included  the  maritime  staff  office,  the  self-defense  fleet,  five 
regional  district  commands,  the  air-training  squadron,  and  vari- 
ous support  units,  such  as  hospitals  and  schools.  The  maritime  staff 
office,  located  in  Tokyo,  served  the  chief  of  staff  in  command  and 
supervision  of  the  force.  The  self-defense  fleet,  headquartered  at 
Yokosuka,  was  charged  with  defense  of  all  waters  around  the 
Japanese  Archipelago.  It  commanded  four  escort  flotillas  (two  based 
in  Yokosuka  and  one  each  in  Sasebo  and  Maizuru),  the  fleet  air 
force  headquartered  at  Atsugi,  two  submarine  flotillas  based  at  Kure 


441 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


and  Yokosuka,  two  mine-sweeping  flotillas  based  at  Kure  and 
Yokosuka,  and  the  fleet  training  command  at  Yokosuka. 

Five  district  units  acted  in  concert  with  the  fleet  to  guard  the 
waters  of  their  jurisdictions  and  provide  shore-based  support.  Dis- 
trict headquarters  were  located  in  Ominato,  Maizuru,  Yokosuka, 
Kure,  and  Sasebo. 

MSDF  recruits  received  three  months  of  basic  training  followed 
by  courses  in  patrol,  gunnery,  mine  sweeping,  convoy  operations, 
and  maritime  transportation.  Flight  students,  all  upper- secondary 
school  graduates,  entered  a  two-year  course.  Officer  candidate 
schools  offered  six-month  courses  to  qualified  enlisted  personnel 
and  those  who  had  completed  flight  school.  Graduates  of  four-year 
universities,  the  four-year  National  Defense  Academy,  and  par- 
ticularly outstanding  enlisted  personnel  underwent  a  one-year  officer 
course  at  the  Officer  Candidate  School  at  Eta  Jima  (site  of  the 
former  Imperial  Naval  Academy).  Special  advanced  courses  for 
officers  were  also  available  in  such  fields  as  submarine  duty  and 
flight  training.  The  MSDF  operated  its  own  staff  college  in  Tokyo 
for  senior  officers. 

The  large  volume  of  coastal  commercial  fishing  and  maritime 
traffic  limited  in-service  sea  training,  especially  in  the  relatively 
shallow  waters  required  for  mine  laying,  mine  sweeping,  and  sub- 
marine rescue  practice.  Training  days  were  scheduled  around  slack 
fishing  seasons  in  winter  and  summer — providing  about  ten  days 
during  the  year.  The  MSDF  maintained  two  oceangoing  training 
ships  and  conducted  annual  long-distance  on-the-job  training  for 
graduates  of  the  one-year  officer  candidate  school. 

The  naval  force's  capacity  to  perform  its  defense  missions  varied 
according  to  the  task.  MSDF  training  emphasized  antisubmarine 
and  antiaircraft  warfare.  Defense  planners  believed  the  most  ef- 
fective approach  to  combating  submarines  entailed  mobilizing  all 
available  weapons,  including  surface  combatants,  submarines,  air- 
craft, and  helicopters,  and  the  numbers  and  armament  of  these 
weapons  were  being  increased  in  the  Mid-Term  Defense  Program. 
A  critical  weakness  remained,  however,  in  the  ability  to  defend 
such  weapons  against  air  attack.  Because  most  of  the  MSDF's  air 
arm  was  detailed  to  antisubmarine  warfare,  the  ASDF  had  to  be 
relied  on  to  provide  air  cover,  an  objective  that  competed  unsuc- 
cessfully with  the  ASDF's  primary  mission  of  air  defense  of  the 
home  islands.  Extended  patrols  over  sea  lanes  were  also  beyond 
the  ASDF's  capabilities.  The  fleet's  capacity  to  provide  ship-based 
anti-air-attack  protection  was  limited  by  the  absence  of  aircraft  car- 
riers and  the  inadequate  number  of  shipborne  long-range  surface- 
to-air  missiles  and  close-range  weapons.  The  fleet  was  also  short

of  underway  replenishment  ships  and  seriously  deficient  in  all  areas 
of  logistic  support  (see  table  40,  Appendix).  These  weaknesses  seri- 
ously compromised  the  ability  of  the  MSDF  to  fulfill  its  mission 
and  to  operate  independently  of  the  United  States  Air  Force  and 
the  United  States  Seventh  Fleet. 

The  Air  Self-Defense  Force 

The  ASDF  was  the  major  aviation  arm  of  the  SDF.  It  had  an 
authorized  strength  of  47,000  and  maintained  some  46,400  per- 
sonnel and  approximately  390  combat  aircraft  in  1989.  Front-line 
formations  included  three  ground- attack  squadrons,  nine  fighter 
squadrons,  one  reconnaissance  squadron,  and  five  transport 
squadrons. 

Major  units  of  the  ASDF  were  the  Air  Defense  Command,  the 
Flight  Support  Command,  Flying  Training  Command,  Air  Develop- 
ing and  Proving  Command,  and  Air  Materiel  Command.  The  Air 
Support  Command  was  responsible  for  direct  support  of  operational 
forces  in  rescue,  transportation,  control,  weather  monitoring,  and 
inspection.  The  Flying  Training  Command  was  responsible  for  basic 
flying  and  technical  training.  The  Air  Developing  and  Proving  Com- 
mand, in  addition  to  overseeing  equipment  research  and  develop- 
ment, was  also  responsible  for  research  and  development  in  such 
areas  as  flight  medicine.  The  Air  Defense  Command  had  North- 
ern, Central,  and  Western  regional  commands  located  at  Misawa, 


443 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


Iruma,  and  Kasuga,  and  a  Southwestern  Composite  Air  Division 
based  at  Naha  on  Okinawa.  All  four  regional  headquarters  con- 
trolled surface-to-air  missile  units  of  both  the  ASDF  and  the  GSDF 
located  in  their  respective  areas. 

For  its  air  defense  of  the  nation,  the  ASDF  in  1989  maintained 
an  integrated  network  of  twenty-eight  radar  installations  and  air 
defense  direction  centers  known  as  the  Basic  Air  Defense  Ground 
Environment.  In  the  late  1980s,  the  system  was  modernized  and 
augmented  with  E-2C  airborne  early-warning  aircraft. 

The  nation  relied  on  fighter-interceptor  aircraft  and  surface-to- 
air  missiles  to  intercept  hostile  aircraft.  In  1989  both  of  these  sys- 
tems were  undergoing  improvement.  Outmoded  aircraft  were  being 
replaced  with  more  sophisticated  models,  and  Nike-J  missiles  were 
being  replaced  with  new  Patriot  systems  (see  table  41 ,  Appendix). 
Essentially,  however,  the  nation  relied  on  United  States  forces  to 
provide  interceptor  capability. 

The  ASDF  also  provided  air  support  for  ground  and  sea  opera- 
tions of  the  GSDF  and  the  MSDF  and  air  defense  for  bases  of  all 
the  forces.  Although  support  fighter  squadrons  were  being  moder- 
nized in  1989,  they  lacked  precision- guided  weapons  for  support 
of  ground  operations  and  attacks  on  hostile  ships,  and  ASDF  pi- 
lots received  little  flight  training  over  oceans  to  prepare  for  mari- 
time operations.  The  ASDF  had  a  poor  base  defense  capability, 
consisting  mainly  of  outmoded  antiaircraft  guns  and  portable 
shelters  to  house  aircraft.  Base  defenses  were  being  upgraded  in 
the  late  1980s  with  new  surface-to-air  missiles,  modern  antiaircraft 
artillery,  and  new  fixed  and  mobile  aircraft  shelters. 

After  passing  an  entrance  examination,  recruits  could  enter  sev- 
eral training  programs.  Lower-secondary  school  graduates  were 
eligible  to  enter  the  ASDF's  four-year  youth  cadet  program  to  earn 
upper- secondary  school  equivalency  and  NCO  status,  or  they  could 
undergo  twelve-week  recruit  training  courses  followed  by  techni- 
cal training  lasting  from  five  to  fifty  weeks.  Upper-secondary  school 
graduates  could  also  enter  either  two-year  NCO  or  four-year  flight 
courses.  Specialized  training  was  available  for  all  NCOs,  as  were 
opportunities  to  enroll  in  officer  and  flight  officer  candidate  courses. 
Graduates  of  the  four-year  National  Defense  Academy  or  four-year 
universities  received  thirty  to  forty  weeks  of  instruction  in  officer 
candidate  schools.  Advanced  technical,  flight,  and  command  staff 
officer  programs  were  available  for  officers. 

Recruitment  and  Conditions  of  Service 

The  total  authorized  strength  in  the  three  branches  of  the  SDF 
was  approximately  274,000  in  1989.  In  addition,  the  SDF  maintained 


444 


National  Security 


a  total  of  about  48,000  reservists  attached  to  the  three  services.  Even 
when  Japan's  active  and  reserve  components  were  combined, 
however,  the  country  maintained  a  lower  ratio  of  military  person- 
nel to  its  population  than  did  any  member  nation  of  the  North 
Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  or  the  Warsaw  Treaty  Or- 
ganization (Warsaw  Pact).  Of  the  major  Asian  nations,  only  India 
and  Indonesia  kept  a  lower  ratio  of  personnel  in  arms. 

The  SDF  was  an  all- volunteer  force.  Conscription  per  se  was 
not  forbidden  by  law,  but  many  citizens  considered  Article  18  of 
the  Constitution,  which  proscribes  involuntary  servitude  except  as 
punishment  for  a  crime,  as  a  legal  prohibition  of  any  form  of  con- 
scription. Even  in  the  absence  of  so  strict  an  interpretation,  however, 
a  military  draft  appeared  politically  impossible. 

SDF  uniformed  personnel  were  recruited  as  private,  E-l,  sea- 
man recruit,  and  airman  basic  for  a  fixed  term.  Ground  forces 
recruits  normally  enlisted  for  two  years;  those  seeking  training  in 
technical  specialties  enlisted  for  three.  Naval  and  air  recruits  nor- 
mally enlisted  for  three  years.  Officer  candidates,  students  in  the 
National  Defense  Academy  and  National  Defense  Medical  Col- 
lege, and  candidate  enlisted  students  in  technical  schools  were  en- 
rolled for  an  indefinite  period.  The  National  Defense  Academy  and 
enlisted  technical  schools  usually  required  an  enrollment  of  four 
years  and  the  National  Defense  Medical  College  six  years. 

When  the  SDF  was  originally  formed,  women  were  recruited 
exclusively  for  the  nursing  services.  Opportunities  were  expanded 
somewhat  when  women  were  permitted  to  join  the  GSDF  com- 
munication service  in  1967  and  the  MSDF  and  ASDF  communi- 
cation services  in  1974.  In  1989  about  77  percent  of  service  areas 
were  open  to  women,  and  there  were  4,924  women  in  the  SDF: 
1,046  nurses,  35  physicians,  and  3,843  general  service  personnel. 

In  the  face  of  some  continued  post- World  War  II  public  apathy 
or  antipathy  toward  the  armed  services,  the  SDF  in  1990  had 
difficulties  in  recruiting  personnel.  The  forces  had  to  compete  for 
qualified  personnel  with  well-paying  industries  and  most  enlistees 
were  ''persuaded"  volunteers  who  signed  up  after  solicitation  from 
recruiters.  Predominantly  rural  prefectures  supplied  military  en- 
listees far  beyond  the  proportions  of  their  populations.  In  areas  such 
as  southern  Kyushu  and  Hokkaido,  where  employment  opportu- 
nities were  limited,  recruiters  were  welcomed  and  supported  by 
the  citizens.  In  contrast,  little  success  or  cooperation  was  encoun- 
tered in  urban  centers  such  as  Tokyo  and  Osaka. 

Because  the  forces  were  all  volunteer  and  legally  civilian,  mem- 
bers could  resign  at  any  time,  and  retention  was  a  problem.  Many 
enlistees  were  lured  away  by  the  prospects  of  highly  paying  civilian 


445 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

jobs,  and  Defense  Agency  officials  complained  of  private  indus- 
tries looting  their  personnel.  The  agency  attempted  to  stop  these 
practices  by  threats  of  sanctions  for  offending  firms  that  held  defense 
contracts  and  by  private  agreements  with  major  industrial  firms. 
Given  the  nation's  labor  shortage,  however,  the  problem  promised 
to  continue. 

Some  older  officers  considered  the  members  of  the  modern  forces 
unequal  to  personnel  of  the  former  Imperial  Army  and  Imperial 
Navy,  but  the  SDF  were  generally  regarded  as  professional  and 
able.  Compared  with  their  counterparts  in  other  nations,  mem- 
bers of  the  SDF  were  remarkably  well  educated  and  in  good  phys- 
ical condition.  Literacy  was  universal,  and  school  training  extensive. 
Personnel  were  trained  in  the  martial  arts,  judo  and  kendo,  and  phys- 
ical standards  were  strict.  The  SDF  probably  did  not  attract  the 
same  high  level  of  personnel  as  other  institutions  in  Japan.  Gradu- 
ates of  the  top  universities  rarely  entered  the  armed  forces,  and 
applicants  to  the  National  Defense  Academy  were  generally  con- 
sidered to  be  on  the  level  of  those  who  applied  to  second-rank  local 
universities. 

In  1990  general  conditions  of  military  life  were  not  such  that 
a  career  in  the  SDF  seemed  an  attractive  alternative  to  one  in  pri- 
vate industry  or  the  bureaucracy.  The  conditions  of  service  provided 
less  dignity,  prestige,  and  comfort  than  they  had  before  World  War 
II,  and  for  most  members  of  the  defense  establishment,  military 
life  offered  less  status  than  did  a  civilian  occupation.  Those  people 
who  entered  the  SDF  were  often  unfairly  perceived  by  the  citizenry 
as  unable  to  find  a  better  job. 

As  special  civil  servants,  SDF  personnel  were  paid  according  to 
civilian  pay  scales  that  did  not  always  distinguish  rank.  At  times 
SDF  salaries  were  greater  for  subordinates  than  for  commanding 
officers;  senior  NCOs  with  long  service  could  earn  more  than  newly 
promoted  colonels.  Pay  raises  were  not  included  in  Defense  Agency 
budgets  and  could  not  be  established  by  military  planners.  Retire- 
ment ages  for  officers  below  flag  rank  ranged  from  fifty-three  to 
fifty-five  years,  and  from  fifty  to  fifty-three  for  enlisted  personnel. 
Limits  were  sometimes  extended  because  of  personnel  shortages. 
In  the  late  1980s,  the  Defense  Agency,  concerned  about  the  difficulty 
of  finding  appropriate  postretirement  employment  for  these  early 
retirees,  provided  vocational  training  for  enlisted  personnel  about 
to  retire  and  transferred  them  to  units  close  to  the  place  where  they 
intended  to  retire.  Beginning  in  October  1987,  the  Self-Defense 
Forces  Job  Placement  Association  provided  free  job  placement  and 
reemployment  support  for  retired  SDF  personnel.  Retirees  also 
received  pensions  immediately  upon  retirement,  some  ten  years 


446 


National  Security 


earlier  than  most  civil  service  personnel.  Financing  the  retirement 
system  promised  to  be  a  problem  of  increasing  scope  in  the  1990s, 
with  the  aging  of  the  population. 

SDF  personnel  benefits  were  not  comparable  to  such  benefits 
for  active-duty  military  personnel  in  other  major  industrialized  na- 
tions. Health  care  was  provided  at  the  SDF  Central  Hospital,  14 
regional  hospitals,  and  165  clinics  in  military  facilities  and  on  board 
ship,  but  only  covered  physical  examinations  and  the  treatment 
of  illness  and  injury  suffered  in  the  course  of  duty.  There  were  no 
commissary  or  exchange  privileges.  Housing  was  often  substan- 
dard, and  military  appropriations  for  facilities  maintenance  often 
focused  on  appeasing  civilian  communities  near  bases  rather  than 
on  improving  on-base  facilities. 

Uniforms,  Ranks,  and  Insignia 

In  1990  uniforms  in  all  three  SDF  branches  were  similar  in  style 
to  those  worn  by  United  States  forces.  GSDF  uniforms  were  gray- 
blue;  MSDF  personnel  wore  traditional  blue  dress,  white  service, 
and  khaki  work  uniforms;  and  ASDF  personnel  wore  the  lighter 
shade  of  blue  worn  by  the  United  States  Air  Force.  The  arm  of 
service  to  which  members  of  the  ground  force  were  attached  was 
indicated  by  piping  of  distinctive  colors:  for  infantry,  red;  artillery, 
yellow;  armor,  orange;  engineers,  violet;  ordnance,  light  green; 
medical,  green;  army  aviation,  light  blue;  signals,  blue;  quarter- 
master, brown;  transportation,  dark  violet;  airborne,  white;  and 
others,  dark  blue.  The  cap  badge  insignia  for  all  displayed  a  dove 
of  peace. 

There  were  nine  officer  ranks  in  the  active  SDF,  along  with  a 
warrant  officer  rank;  five  NCO  ranks;  and  three  enlisted  ranks  (see 
fig.  14).  The  highest  NCO  rank,  first  sergeant  (senior  chief  petty 
officer  in  the  MSDF  and  senior  master  sergeant  in  the  ASDF),  was 
established  in  1 980  to  provide  more  promotion  opportunities  and 
shorter  terms  of  service  as  sergeant  first  class,  chief  petty  officer, 
or  master  sergeant.  Under  the  earlier  system,  the  average  NCO 
was  promoted  only  twice  in  approximately  thirty  years  of  service 
and  remained  at  the  top  rank  for  almost  ten  years. 

Defense  Spending 

According  to  Japanese  security  policy,  maintaining  a  military 
establishment  was  only  one  method — and  by  no  means  the  best — to 
achieve  national  security.  Diplomacy,  economic  aid  and  develop- 
ment, and  a  close  relationship  with  the  United  States  under  the 
terms  of  the  1960  security  treaty  were  all  considered  more  impor- 
tant. Even  in  the  1980s,  defense  spending  was  accorded  a  relatively

low  priority.  For  FY  1986  through  FY  1990,  defense's  share  of  the 
general  budget  was  around  6.5  percent,  as  compared  to  approxi- 
mately 28  percent  for  the  United  States.  In  1987  Japan  ranked  sixth 
in  the  world  in  total  defense  expenditures  behind  the  Soviet  Union, 
the  United  States,  France,  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West 
Germany),  and  Britain.  By  1989  it  ranked  third  after  the  United 
States  and  the  Soviet  Union,  mainly  because  of  the  increased  value 
of  the  yen. 

In  addition  to  annual  budgets,  the  Defense  Agency  prepared  a 
series  of  cabinet- approved  build-up  plans  beginning  in  1957,  which 
set  goals  for  specific  task  capabilities  and  established  procurement 
targets  to  achieve  them.  Under  the  first  three  plans  (for  1958-60, 
1962-66,  and  1967-71),  funding  priorities  were  set  to  establish  the 
ability  to  counter  limited  aggression.  Economic  difficulties  follow- 
ing the  1973  oil  crisis,  however,  caused  major  problems  in  achiev- 
ing the  Fourth  Defense  Buildup  Plan  (1972-76)  and  forced  funding 
to  be  cut,  raising  questions  about  the  basic  concepts  underlying 
defense  policies  (see  Monetary  and  Fiscal  Policy,  ch.  4). 

In  1976  the  government  recognized  that  substantial  increases  in 
spending,  personnel,  and  bases  would  be  virtually  impossible.  In- 
stead a  "standard  defense  concept"  was  suggested,  one  stressing 
qualitative  improvements  in  the  SDF,  rather  than  quantitative  ones. 
It  was  decided  that  defense  spending  would  focus  on  achieving  a 
basic  level  of  defense  as  set  forth  in  the  1976  National  Defense  Pro- 
gram Outline.  Thereafter,  the  government  ceased  to  offer  buildup 
plans  that  alarmed  the  public  by  their  seemingly  open-ended  na- 
ture and  switched  to  reliance  on  single  fiscal  year  formulas  that 
offered  explicit,  attainable  goals. 

Defense  spending  increased  slightly  during  the  late  1970s,  and 
in  the  1980s  only  the  defense  and  Official  Development  Assistance 
budgets  were  allowed  to  increase  in  real  terms.  In  1985  the  Defense 
Agency  developed  the  Mid-Term  Defense  Estimate  objectives  for 
FY  1986  through  FY  1990,  to  improve  SDF  front-line  equipment 
and  upgrade  logistic  support  systems.  For  the  GSDF,  these  mea- 
sures included  the  purchase  of  advanced  weapons  and  equipment 
to  improve  antitank,  artillery,  ground- to- sea  firepower,  and  mo- 
bile capabilities.  For  the  MSDF,  the  focus  was  on  upgrading  anti- 
submarine capabilities,  with  the  purchase  of  new  destroyer  escorts 
equipped  with  the  Aegis  system  and  SH-60J  antisubmarine  heli- 
copters, and  on  improving  antimine  warfare  and  air  defense  sys- 
tems. ASDF  funds  were  concentrated  on  the  purchase  of  fighter 
aircraft  and  rescue  helicopters.  The  entire  cost  of  the  Mid-Term 
Defense  Estimate  for  FY  1986  through  FY  1990  was  projected  at 


450 


National  Security 


approximately  ¥18.4  trillion  (approximately  US$83.2  billion,  at 
the  1985  exchange  rate). 

In  FY  1989  the  ¥3.9  trillion  defense  budget  accounted  for  6.49 
percent  of  the  total  budget,  1 .006  percent  of  the  GNP.  In  addition 
to  the  Defense  Agency  itself,  the  defense  budget  supported  the 
Defense  Facilities  Administration  Agency  and  the  Security  Coun- 
cil. Defense  Agency  funding  covered  GSDF,  MSDF,  and  ASDF, 
and  the  internal  bureaus,  the  Joint  Staff  Council,  the  the  National 
Defense  Academy,  the  National  Defense  Medical  College,  the  Na- 
tional Institute  for  Defense  Studies,  the  Technical  Research  and 
Development  Institute,  and  the  Central  Procurement  Office. 

The  FY  1990  defense  budget,  at  0.997  percent  of  the  forecasted 
GNP,  dipped  below  the  1  percent  level  for  the  first  time  since  it 
was  reached  in  1987.  But  the  more  than  ¥4.1  trillion  budget  still 
marked  a  6.1  percent  increase  over  the  FY  1989  defense  budget 
and  provided  virtually  all  of  the  ¥104  billion  requested  for  research 
and  development,  including  substantial  funds  for  guided-missile 
and  communications  technologies.  Although  some  ¥34.6  billion 
was  authorized  over  several  years  for  joint  Japan-United  States 
research  and  development  of  the  experimental  FSX  fighter  plane, 
disputes  over  this  project  were  believed  to  have  convinced  the 
Defense  Agency  to  strengthen  the  capability  of  the  domestic  arms 
industry  and  increase  its  share  of  SDF  contracts.  After  originally 
being  cut,  funds  were  also  restored  for  thirty  advanced  model  tanks 
and  the  last  Aegis  multiple-targeting-equipped  destroyer  escort 
needed  to  complete  the  Mid-Term  Defense  Estimate.  The  6. 1  per- 
cent defense  increase  was  accompanied  by  an  even  larger  (8.2  per- 
cent) increase  in  Official  Development  Assistance  funding. 

Officials  resisted  United  States  pressure  to  agree  formally  that 
Japan  would  support  more  of  the  cost  of  maintaining  United  States 
troops,  claiming  that  such  a  move  would  require  revision  of  agree- 
ments between  the  two  nations.  But  in  FY  1989  the  Japanese 
government  contributed  US$2.4  billion — roughly  40  percent — of 
the  total  cost.  The  contribution  slated  for  FY  1990  was  increased 
to  US$2.8  billion — nearly  10  percent  of  the  total  defense  budget — 
and  by  the  end  of  FY  1 990  the  Japanese  government  expected  to 
assume  all  expenses  for  utilities  and  building  maintenance  costs 
for  United  States  troops  stationed  in  Japan. 

The  Defense  Industry 

Dismantled  by  occupation  authorities  after  World  War  II,  ar- 
maments production  resumed  in  1952  when  the  nation's  manufac- 
turers began  repairing  and  maintaining  equipment  for  United  States 
forces  operating  in  Asia.  Individual  producers  emerged  as  affiliates 


451 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

of  larger  industrial  conglomerates,  including  the  former  zaibatsu 
(see  Glossary)  of  Mitsubishi  and  Sumitomo.  After  1954  the  defense 
industry  began  to  arm  the  SDF,  at  first  making  only  slight  improve- 
ments on  United  States-designed  equipment  manufactured  for  local 
use.  The  Japanese  defense  industry  received  about  US$10  billion 
worth  of  advanced  technology  from  the  United  States  between  1950 
and  1983. 

In  July  1970,  Defense  Agency  Director  General  Nakasone  Yasu- 
hiro  established  five  objectives  for  the  defense  industry:  to  main- 
tain Japan's  industrial  base  for  national  security,  to  acquire 
equipment  from  Japan's  domestic  research  and  development  and 
production  efforts,  to  use  civilian  industries  for  domestic  arms 
production,  to  set  long-term  goals  for  research  and  development 
and  production,  and  to  introduce  competition  into  defense  produc- 
tion. By  the  late  1970s,  indigenous  suppliers  had  developed  and 
produced  an  almost  complete  range  of  modern  equipment,  includ- 
ing aircraft,  tanks,  artillery,  and  major  surface  and  underwater 
naval  combatants.  Certain  types  of  highly  sophisticated  weaponry, 
including  F-15  fighters,  P-3C  Orion  antisubmarine  aircraft,  and 
8-inch  howitzers,  were  produced  under  license.  Except  for  the  most 
complex  and  costiy  items,  such  as  the  E-2C  airborne  early-warning 
aircraft,  little  was  purchased  complete  from  foreign  suppliers. 

Over  25  percent  of  the  ¥18.4  trillion  Mid-Term  Defense  Esti- 
mate for  FY  1986  through  1990  was  allocated  for  equipment 
procurement,  most  of  it  domestically  produced;  but  the  most  lucra- 
tive defense  contract  was  for  the  FSX.  Envisioned  as  a  successor 
to  the  F-l  support  fighter  in  the  ASDF  inventory,  the  FSX  was 
expected  to  take  ten  years  to  develop  at  an  estimated  cost  of  ¥200 
billion.  In  October  1985,  the  Defense  Agency  began  by  consider- 
ing three  development  options  for  the  FSX:  domestic  development, 
adoption  of  an  existing  domestic  model,  or  adoption  of  a  foreign 
model.  The  agency  originally  favored  domestic  development.  But 
by  late  1986,  after  consultation  and  much  pressure  from  the  United 
States,  it  decided  to  consider  a  coproduction  agreement  with  the 
United  States.  And  in  October  1987,  Japanese  and  United  States 
defense  officials  meeting  in  Washington  decided  on  a  joint  project 
to  remodel  either  the  F-15  or  the  F-l 6.  The  Defense  Agency  se- 
lected the  F-16.  Once  the  agreement  was  reached,  it  came  under 
heavy  criticism  from  members  of  the  United  States  Congress 
concerned  about  loss  of  key  United  States  technologies  and  tech- 
nological leadership,  risks  of  Japanese  commercialization  of  tech- 
nology at  United  States  expense,  and  insufficient  work  share  for 
American  firms.  As  a  result  of  the  controversy,  in  early  1989  the 
United  States  demanded  and  obtained  a  review  and  revision  of  the 


452

agreement,  restricting  technology  transfer  and  specifying  that 
American  firms  would  receive  40  percent  of  the  work.  The  con- 
troversy left  bitterness  on  both  sides,  and  Japanese  industrialists, 
convinced  that  a  Japanese-designed  and  Japanese-developed  FSX 
would  be  superior  to  a  modified  F-16  codeveloped  by  Japan  and 
the  United  States  and  irritated  at  United  States  pressure  to  renego- 
tiate an  agreement  they  considered  already  favorable  to  the  United 
States,  seemed  in  1990  to  be  inclined  to  go  it  alone  on  future 
weapons  research. 

In  the  late  1980s,  the  defense  industry,  limited  by  the  lack  of 
research  and  development,  inadequate  testing  equipment,  restricted 
exports,  and  no  economies  of  scale,  accounted  for  only  0.5  per- 
cent of  Japan's  total  industrial  output.  The  Defense  Production 
Committee  of  the  Federation  of  Economic  Organizations  (Keizai 
Dantai  Rengokai — Keidanren)  was  an  important  element  in  defense 
production,  negotiating  with  the  Defense  Agency  and  coordinat- 
ing activities  among  defense  firms.  Keidanren  disseminated  defense 
information  and  informally  limited  competition  by  promoting  agree- 
ments between  companies.  Nearly  60  percent  of  Japanese  defense 
contracts  were  awarded  to  five  large  corporations:  Mitsubishi  Heavy 
Industries,  Toshiba  Corporation,  Mitsubishi  Electric  Corporation, 
Kawasaki  Heavy  Industries,  and  Ishikawajima-Harima  Heavy 
Industries  Corporation.  Competition  for  contracts  nonetheless  in- 
tensified in  the  1980s,  as  larger  portions  of  the  defense  budget  were 
allotted  to  procurement.  But  for  the  Japanese  defense  industry  to 
become  efficient  it  had  to  depend  on  economies  of  scale  that  could 
only  be  achieved  through  export.  Ishikawajima-Harima  Heavy 
Industries  indicated  an  interest  in  the  arms  export  market  when 
it  changed  its  articles  of  incorporation  to  include  arms  in  its  list 
of  products  in  June  1987  and  later  asked  that  weapons  export 


453

restrictions  be  eased  during  the  1990s.  A  secret  memorandum  cir- 
culating among  defense  contractors  in  1988  estimated  that  lifting 
the  export  ban  (that  existed  by  general  interpretation  of  Article  9 
of  the  Constitution)  would  result  in  Japan's  capturing  45  percent 
of  the  world  tank  and  self-propelled  artillery  market,  40  percent 
of  military  electronic  sales,  and  60  percent  of  naval  ship  construc- 
tion. In  1989  a  Keidanren  committee  headed  by  Kanamori  Masao, 
chairman  of  Mitsubishi  Heavy  Industries,  called  for  increasing 
defense  research  and  development  to  5  percent  of  the  total  defense 
budget.  The  FY  1990  defense  budget  allotted  approximately  2  per- 
cent for  this  purpose.  In  the  1990s,  Japanese  corporations  might 
be  expected  to  market  mainly  dual-use  electronics  subcomponents, 
vehicles,  and  transport  and  communications  equipment  offshore 
or  through  front  companies  and  to  provide  components  for  mis- 
siles and  aircraft  produced  overseas,  especially  in  the  United  States. 

Military  Relations  with  the  United  States 

The  1952  Mutual  Security  Assistance  Pact  provided  the  initial 
basis  for  the  nation's  security  relations  with  the  United  States  (see 
World  War  II  and  the  Occupation,  1941-52,  ch.  1;  Relations  with 
the  United  States,  ch.  7).  The  pact  was  replaced  in  1960  by  the 
Treaty  of  Mutual  Cooperation  and  Security,  which  declares  that 
both  nations  will  maintain  and  develop  their  capacities  to  resist 
armed  attack  in  common  and  that  each  recognizes  that  an  armed 
attack  on  either  one  in  territories  administered  by  Japan  will  be 
considered  dangerous  to  the  safety  of  the  other.  The  Agreed  Minutes 
to  the  treaty  specified  that  the  Japanese  government  must  be  con- 
sulted prior  to  major  changes  in  United  States  force  deployment 
in  Japan  or  to  the  use  of  Japanese  bases  for  combat  operations  other 
than  in  defense  of  Japan  itself.  However,  Japan  was  relieved  by 
its  constitutional  prohibition  of  participating  in  external  military 
operations  from  any  obligation  to  defend  the  United  States  if  it 
were  attacked  outside  of  Japanese  territories.  In  1990  the  Japanese 
government  expressed  its  intention  to  continue  to  rely  on  the  treaty's 
arrangements  to  guarantee  national  security. 

The  Agreed  Minutes  under  Article  6  of  the  1 960  treaty  contain 
a  status-of-forces  agreement  on  the  stationing  of  United  States  forces 
in  Japan,  with  specifics  on  the  provision  of  facilities  and  areas  for 
their  use  and  on  the  administration  of  Japanese  citizens  employed 
on  the  facilities.  Also  covered  are  the  limits  of  the  two  countries' 
jurisdictions  over  crimes  committed  in  Japan  by  United  States  mili- 
tary personnel. 

The  Mutual  Security  Assistance  Pact  of  1952  initially  involved 
a  military  aid  program  that  provided  for  Japan's  acquisition  of 


454 


National  Security 


funds,  materiel,  and  services  for  the  nation's  essential  defense. 
Although  Japan  no  longer  received  any  aid  from  the  United  States 
by  the  1960s,  the  agreement  continued  to  serve  as  the  basis  for  pur- 
chase and  licensing  agreements  assuring  interoperability  of  the  two 
nations'  weapons  and  for  the  release  of  classified  data  to  Japan, 
including  both  international  intelligence  reports  and  classified  tech- 
nical information. 

A  major  issue  for  military  relations  between  the  two  nations  was 
resolved  in  1972  when  the  Ryukyu  Islands,  including  Okinawa, 
reverted  to  Japanese  control,  and  the  provisions  of  the  1960  secu- 
rity treaty  were  extended  to  cover  them.  The  United  States  retained 
the  right  to  station  forces  in  these  islands.  In  1990,  30,000  United 
States  troops  still  occupied  20  percent  of  Okinawa's  land,  a  source 
of  friction  with  the  local  population.  Military  relations  improved 
after  the  mid-1970s.  In  the  early  1960s,  a  Security  Consultative 
Committee,  with  representatives  from  both  countries,  had  been 
set  up  under  the  1960  security  treaty  to  discuss  and  coordinate  secu- 
rity matters  concerning  both  nations.  In  1976  a  subcommittee  of 
that  body  prepared  the  Guidelines  for  Japan-United  States  Defense 
Cooperation  that  were  approved  by  the  full  committee  in  1978  and 
later  approved  by  the  National  Defense  Council  and  cabinet.  The 
guidelines  authorized  unprecedented  activities  in  joint  defense  plan- 
ning, response  to  an  armed  attack  on  Japan,  and  for  cooperation 
on  situations  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  region  that  could  affect  Japan's 
security. 

Under  the  framework  of  the  guidelines,  the  Japanese  Joint  Staff 
Council  and  the  commander  of  United  States  Forces,  Japan,  drew 
up  a  long-range  program  for  joint  exercises  to  encompass  all  three 
services  of  both  nations.  Every  year  during  the  1980s,  the  GSDF 
conducted  command  post  and  field-training  exercises  involving  units 
from  each  of  the  regional  armies  in  combined  training  with  United 
States  forces.  Although  the  MSDF  had  participated  in  exercises 
with  the  United  States  Navy  since  1955,  in  1980  Japan,  in  an  un- 
precedented move,  permitted  a  task  force  of  ships  and  aircraft  to 
train  in  the  Rim  of  the  Pacific  (RIMPAC)  comprehensive  naval 
exercise  with  naval  forces  from  the  United  States,  Australia,  Can- 
ada, and  New  Zealand.  Japan  also  participated  in  RIMPAC  '88 
with  eight  destroyers  and  frigates,  one  submarine,  eight  P-3C  anti- 
submarine aircraft,  and  one  supply  ship.  The  ASDF  also  conducted 
numerous  air  defense,  fighter,  rescue,  and  command  post  train- 
ing exercises  with  United  States  Air  Force  units. 

In  1990  over  50,000  members  of  the  United  States  armed  forces 
were  stationed  in  Japan,  including  almost  24,000  marines,  16,200 
air  force  personnel,  8,100  members  of  the  navy,  and  2,400  army 


455

personnel,  who  were  deployed  at  several  locations  on  Honshu, 
Kyushu,  and  Okinawa.  These  numbers  represented  a  substantial 
increase — more  than  10  percent — over  1980  figures,  but  the  number 
of  United  States  troops  maintained  on  Japanese  soil  was  expected 
to  be  reduced  to  the  1980  level  by  1993. 

Public  Order  and  Internal  Security 

Conditions  of  public  order  in  1990  compared  favorably  with  those 
in  other  industrialized  countries.  The  overall  crime  rate  was  low 
by  North  American  and  West  European  standards  and  had  shown 
a  general  decline  since  the  mid-1960s.  The  incidence  of  violent  crime 
was  especially  low,  owing  in  part  to  effective  enforcement  of  strin- 
gent firearms  control  laws.  Problems  of  particular  concern  were 
those  associated  with  a  modern  industralized  nation,  including 
juvenile  delinquency,  traffic  control,  and  white-collar  crime. 

Civil  disorders  occurred  from  the  early  1950s,  chiefly  in  Tokyo, 
but  did  not  seriously  threaten  the  internal  security  of  the  state.  Far 
less  frequent  after  the  early  1970s,  they  were  in  all  cases  effectively 
countered  by  efficient  and  well-trained  police  units  employing  the 
most  sophisticated  techniques  of  riot  control. 

In  1990  the  police  were  an  apolitical  body  under  the  general  su- 
pervision of  independent  agencies,  free  of  direct  central  govern- 
ment executive  control.  They  were  checked  by  an  independent 
judiciary  and  monitored  by  a  free  and  active  press.  The  police  were 
generally  well  respected  and  could  rely  on  considerable  public 
cooperation  in  their  work. 

Officials  involved  in  the  criminal  justice  system  were  usually 
highly  trained  professionals  interested  in  preventing  crime  and  re- 
habilitating offenders.  They  were  allowed  considerable  discretion 
in  dealing  with  legal  infractions  and  in  1 990  appeared  to  deserve 
the  trust  and  respect  accorded  to  them  by  the  general  public.  Con- 
stitutionally guaranteed  rights  of  habeas  corpus,  protection  against 
self-incrimination,  and  the  inadmissability  of  confessions  obtained 
under  duress  were  enforced  by  criminal  procedures. 

The  prison  system  in  1990  was  generally  modern  and  conducted 
from  the  viewpoint  of  resocialization.  Prisoners  were  treated  on 
an  individualized  basis,  and  education  was  emphasized.  Special 
attention  was  given  to  juvenile  offenders  who  were  normally  housed 
separately  from  adult  prisoners.  A  well-organized  parole  and  pro- 
bation program  employed  numerous  citizen  volunteers. 

The  Police  System 

The  Japanese  government  established  a  European- style  civil 
police  system  in  1874,  under  the  centralized  control  of  the  Police 


456 


National  Security 


Bureau  within  the  Home  Ministry,  to  put  down  internal  distur- 
bances and  maintain  order  during  the  Meiji  Restoration.  By  the 
1880s,  the  police  had  developed  as  a  nationwide  instrument  of 
government  control,  providing  support  for  local  leaders  and  en- 
forcing public  morality.  They  acted  as  general  civil  administrators, 
implementing  official  policies,  and  thereby  facilitating  unification 
and  modernization.  In  rural  areas  especially,  the  police  had  great 
authority  and  were  accorded  the  same  mixture  of  fear  and  respect 
as  the  village  head.  Their  increasing  involvement  in  political  af- 
fairs was  one  of  the  foundations  of  the  authoritarian  state  in  Japan 
in  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth  century. 

The  centralized  police  system  steadily  acquired  responsibilities, 
until  it  controlled  almost  all  aspects  of  daily  life,  including  fire 
prevention  and  mediation  of  labor  disputes.  The  system  regulated 
public  health,  business,  factories,  and  construction,  and  issued  per- 
mits and  licenses.  The  Peace  Preservation  Law  of  1925  gave  police 
the  authority  to  arrest  people  for  '  'wrong  thoughts. ' '  Special  Higher 
Police  were  created  to  regulate  motion  pictures,  political  meetings, 
and  election  campaigns.  Military  police  operating  under  the  army 
and  navy  and  the  justice  and  home  ministries  aided  the  civilian 
police  in  limiting  proscribed  political  activity.  After  the  Manchu- 
rian  Incident  of  1931 ,  military  police  assumed  more  authority,  lead- 
ing to  friction  with  their  civilian  counterparts  (see  World  War  II, 
this  ch.).  After  1937  police  directed  business  activities  for  the  war 
effort,  mobilized  labor,  and  controlled  transportation. 

After  Japan's  surrender  in  1945,  occupation  authorities  retained 
the  prewar  police  structure  until  a  new  system  was  implemented 
and  the  Diet  passed  the  1947  Police  Law.  Contrary  to  Japanese 
proposals  for  a  strong,  centralized  force  to  deal  with  postwar  un- 
rest, the  police  system  was  decentralized.  About  1,600  indepen- 
dent municipal  forces  were  established  in  cities,  towns,  and  villages 
with  5,000  inhabitants  or  more,  and  a  National  Rural  Police  was 
organized  by  prefecture.  Civilian  control  was  to  be  ensured  by  plac- 
ing the  police  under  the  jurisdiction  of  public  safety  commissions 
controlled  by  the  National  Public  Safety  Commission  in  the  Office 
of  the  Prime  Minister.  The  Home  Ministry  was  abolished  and 
replaced  by  the  less  powerful  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  and  the 
police  were  stripped  of  their  responsibility  for  fire  protection,  public 
health,  and  other  administrative  duties. 

When  most  occupation  forces  were  transferred  to  Korea  in 
1950-51,  the  75,000  strong  National  Police  Reserve  was  formed 
to  back  up  the  ordinary  police  during  civil  disturbances,  and  pres- 
sure mounted  for  a  centralized  system  more  compatible  with 
Japanese  political  preferences.  The  1947  Police  Law  was  amended 


457 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

in  1951  to  allow  the  municipal  police  of  smaller  communities  to 
merge  with  the  National  Rural  Police.  Most  chose  this  arrange- 
ment, and  by  1954  only  about  400  cities,  towns,  and  villages  still 
had  their  own  police  forces.  Under  the  1954  amended  Police  Law, 
a  final  restructuring  created  an  even  more  centralized  system  in 
which  local  forces  were  organized  by  prefectures  under  a  National 
Police  Agency. 

The  revised  Police  Law  of  1954,  still  in  effect  in  1990,  preserved 
some  strong  points  of  the  postwar  system,  particularly  measures 
ensuring  civilian  control  and  political  neutrality,  while  allowing 
for  increased  centralization.  The  National  Public  Safety  Commis- 
sion system  was  retained.  State  responsibility  for  maintaining  public 
order  was  clarified  to  include  coordination  of  national  and  local 
efforts,  centralization  of  police  information,  communications,  and 
recordkeeping  facilities,  and  national  standards  for  training,  uni- 
forms, pay,  rank,  and  promotion.  Rural  and  municipal  forces  were 
abolished  and  integrated  into  prefectural  forces,  which  handled  basic 
police  matters.  Officials  and  inspectors  in  various  ministries  and 
agencies  continued  to  exercise  special  police  functions  assigned  to 
them  in  the  1947  Police  Law. 

National  Organization 

In  1990  the  mission  of  the  National  Public  Safety  Commission 
was  to  guarantee  the  neutrality  of  the  police  by  insulating  the  force 
from  political  pressure  and  to  ensure  the  maintenance  of  democratic 
methods  in  police  administration.  The  commission's  primary  func- 
tion was  to  supervise  the  National  Police  Agency,  and  it  had  the 
authority  to  appoint  or  dismiss  senior  police  officers  (see  fig.  15). 
The  commission  consisted  of  a  chairman,  who  held  the  rank  of 
minister  of  state,  and  five  members  appointed  by  the  prime  minister 
with  the  consent  of  both  houses  of  the  Diet.  The  commission  oper- 
ated independently  of  the  cabinet,  but  liaison  and  coordination  with 
it  were  facilitated  by  the  chairman's  being  a  member  of  that  body. 

As  the  central  coordinating  body  for  the  entire  police  system, 
the  National  Police  Agency  determined  general  standards  and  poli- 
cies; detailed  direction  of  operations  was  left  to  the  lower  echelons. 
In  a  national  emergency  or  large-scale  disaster,  the  agency  was 
authorized  to  take  command  of  prefectural  police  forces.  In  1989 
the  agency  was  composed  of  around  1,100  national  civil  servants, 
empowered  to  collect  information  and  to  formulate  and  execute 
national  policies.  The  agency  was  headed  by  a  commissioner  gen- 
eral who  was  appointed  by  the  National  Public  Safety  Commis- 
sion with  the  approval  of  the  prime  minister.  The  central  office 
included  the  Secretariat,  with  divisions  for  general  operations, 


458 


National  Security 


planning,  information,  finance,  management,  and  procurement 
and  distribution  of  police  equipment,  and  five  bureaus.  The  Police 
Administration  Bureau  was  concerned  with  police  personnel,  edu- 
cation, welfare,  training,  and  unit  inspections.  The  Criminal  In- 
vestigation Bureau  was  in  charge  of  research  statistics  and  the 
investigation  of  nationally  important  and  international  cases.  This 
bureau's  Safety  Department  was  responsible  for  crime  prevention, 
combating  juvenile  delinquency,  and  pollution  control.  In  addi- 
tion, the  Criminal  Investigation  Bureau  surveyed,  formulated,  and 
recommended  legislation  on  firearms,  explosives,  food,  drugs,  and 
narcotics.  The  Communications  Bureau  supervised  police  commu- 
nications systems. 

The  Traffic  Bureau  licensed  drivers,  enforced  traffic  safety  laws, 
and  regulated  traffic.  Intensive  traffic  safety  and  driver  education 
campaigns  were  run  at  both  national  and  prefectural  levels.  The 
bureau's  Expressway  Division  addressed  special  conditions  of  the 
nation's  growing  system  of  express  highways. 

The  Security  Bureau  formulated  and  supervised  the  execution 
of  security  policies.  It  conducted  research  on  equipment  and  tac- 
tics for  suppressing  riots  and  oversaw  and  coordinated  activities 
of  the  riot  police.  The  Security  Bureau  was  also  responsible  for 
security  intelligence  on  foreigners  and  radical  political  groups,  in- 
cluding investigation  of  violations  of  the  Alien  Registration  Law 
and  administration  of  the  Entry  and  Exit  Control  Law.  The  bureau 
also  implemented  security  policies  during  national  emergencies  and 
natural  disasters. 

In  1990  the  National  Police  Agency  maintained  seven  regional 
police  bureaus,  each  responsible  for  a  number  of  prefectures. 
Metropolitan  Tokyo  and  the  island  of  Hokkaido  were  excluded  from 
these  regional  jurisdictions  and  run  more  autonomously  than  other 
local  forces,  in  the  case  of  Tokyo,  because  of  its  special  urban  situ- 
ation, and  of  Hokkaido,  because  of  its  distinctive  geography  (see 
Geographic  Regions,  ch.  2).  The  National  Police  Agency  main- 
tained police  communications  divisions  in  these  two  areas  to  han- 
dle any  coordination  needed  between  national  and  local  forces. 

Local  Organization 

In  1987  there  were  223,000  police  officers  nationwide,  most 
affiliated  with  local  police  forces.  Local  forces  included  forty- 
three  prefectural  {ken)  police  forces;  one  metropolitan  (to)  police 
force,  in  Tokyo;  two  urban  prefectural  (fit)  police  forces,  in  Osaka 
and  Kyoto;  and  one  district  (do)  police  force,  in  Hokkaido.  These 
forces  had  limited  authority  to  initiate  police  actions.  Their  most 
important  activities  were  regulated  by  the  National  Police  Agency,

which  provided  funds  for  equipment,  salaries,  riot,  escort,  and 
natural  disaster  duties,  and  internal  security  and  multiple  juris- 
diction cases.  National  police  statutes  and  regulations  established 
the  strength  and  rank  allocations  of  all  local  personnel  and  the 
locations  of  local  police  stations.  Prefectural  police  financed  and 
controlled  the  patrol  officer  on  the  beat,  traffic  control,  criminal 
investigations,  and  other  daily  operations. 

Each  prefectural  police  headquarters  contained  administrative 
divisions  corresponding  to  those  of  the  bureaus  of  the  National 
Police  Agency.  Headquarters  were  staffed  by  specialists  in  basic 
police  functions  and  administration  and  were  commanded  by  an 
officer  appointed  by  the  local  Office  of  the  National  Public  Safety 
Commission.  Most  arrests  and  investigations  were  performed  by 
prefectural  police  officials  (and  in  large  jurisdictions,  by  police  as- 
signed to  substations),  who  were  assigned  to  one  or  more  central 
locations  within  the  prefecture.  Experienced  officers  were  organized 
into  functional  bureaus  and  handled  all  but  the  most  ordinary 
problems  in  their  fields. 

Below  these  stations,  police  boxes  {koban) — substations  near  major 
transportation  hubs  and  shopping  areas  and  in  residential 
districts — formed  the  first  line  of  police  response  to  the  public.  In 
the  late  1980s,  about  20  percent  of  the  total  police  force  was  as- 
signed to  koban.  Staffed  by  three  or  more  officers  working  in  eight- 
hour  shifts,  they  served  as  a  base  for  foot  patrols  and  usually  had 
both  sleeping  and  eating  facilities  for  officers  on  duty  but  not  on 
watch.  In  rural  areas,  residential  offices  usually  were  staffed  by 
one  police  officer  who  resided  in  adjacent  family  quarters.  These 
officers  endeavored  to  become  a  part  of  the  community,  and  their 
families  often  aided  in  performing  official  tasks. 

Officers  assigned  to  koban  had  intimate  knowledge  of  their  juris- 
dictions. One  of  their  primary  tasks  was  to  conduct  twice-yearly 
house-by-house  residential  surveys  of  homes  in  their  areas,  at  which 
time  the  head  of  the  household  at  each  address  filled  out  a  resi- 
dence information  card  detailing  the  names,  ages,  occupations,  busi- 
ness addresses,  and  vehicle  registration  numbers  of  household 
occupants  and  the  names  of  relatives  living  elsewhere.  Police  took 
special  note  of  names  of  the  aged  or  those  living  alone  who  might 
need  special  attention  in  an  emergency.  They  conducted  surveys 
of  local  businesses  and  recorded  employee  names  and  addresses, 
in  addition  to  such  data  as  which  establishments  stayed  open  late 
and  which  employees  might  be  expected  to  work  late.  Participa- 
tion in  the  survey  was  voluntary,  and  most  citizens  cooperated, 
but  in  the  late  1980s  an  increasing  segment  of  the  population  had 
come  to  regard  the  surveys  as  invasions  of  privacy. 


461 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Information  elicited  through  the  surveys  was  not  centralized  but 
was  stored  in  each  police  box,  where  it  was  used  primarily  as  an 
aid  to  locating  people.  When  a  crime  occurred  or  an  investigation 
was  underway,  however,  these  files  were  invaluable  in  establish- 
ing background  data  for  a  case.  Specialists  from  district  police  sta- 
tions spent  considerable  time  culling  through  the  usually  poorly 
filed  data  maintained  in  the  police  boxes. 

Riot  Police 

Within  their  security  divisions,  each  prefectural  level  police 
department  and  the  Tokyo  police  maintained  special  riot  units. 
These  units  were  formed  after  riots  at  the  Imperial  Palace  in  1952, 
to  respond  quickly  and  effectively  to  large  public  disturbances.  They 
were  also  used  in  crowd  control  during  festival  periods,  at  times 
of  natural  disaster,  and  to  reinforce  regular  police  when  necessary. 
Full-time  riot  police  could  also  be  augmented  by  regular  police 
trained  in  riot  duties. 

In  handling  demonstrations  and  violent  disturbances,  riot  units 
were  deployed  en  masse,  military  style.  It  was  common  practice 
for  files  of  riot  police  to  line  streets  through  which  demonstrations 
passed.  If  demonstrators  grew  disorderly  or  deviated  from  officially 
countenanced  areas,  riot  police  stood  shoulder- to- shoulder,  some- 
times three  and  four  deep,  to  push  with  their  hands  to  control  the 
crowds.  Individual  action  was  forbidden.  Three-person  units  some- 
times performed  reconnaissance  duties,  but  more  often  operations 
were  carried  out  by  squads  of  nine  to  eleven,  platoons  of  twenty- 
seven  to  thirty- three,  and  companies  of  eighty  to  one  hundred.  Front 
ranks  were  trained  to  open  to  allow  passage  of  special  squads  to 
rescue  captured  police  or  to  engage  in  tear  gas  assaults.  Each  per- 
son wore  a  radio  with  an  earpiece  to  hear  commands  given  simul- 
taneously to  the  formation. 

The  riot  police  were  committed  to  using  disciplined,  nonlethal 
force  and  carried  no  firearms.  They  were  trained  to  take  pride  in 
their  poise  under  stress.  Demonstrators  also  were  usually  restrained 
(see  Civil  Disturbances,  this  ch.).  Police  brutality  was  rarely  an 
issue.  When  excesses  occurred,  the  perpetrator  was  disciplined  and 
sometimes  transferred  from  the  force  if  considered  unable  to  keep 
his  temper. 

Extensive  experience  in  quelling  violent  disorders  led  to  the  de- 
velopment of  special  uniforms  and  equipment  for  the  riot  police 
units.  In  the  1980s,  riot  dress  consisted  of  a  field- type  jacket,  which 
covered  several  pieces  of  body  armor  and  included  a  corselet  hung 
from  the  waist,  an  aluminum  plate  down  the  backbone,  and  shoul- 
der pads.  Armored  gauntlets  covered  the  hands  and  forearms. 


462

Helmets  had  faceplates  and  flared  padded  skirts  down  the  back  to 
protect  the  neck.  In  case  of  violence,  the  front  ranks  carried 
1 .2-meter  shields  to  protect  against  staves  and  rocks  and  held  nets 
on  high  poles  to  catch  flying  objects.  Specially  designed  equipment 
included  water  cannons,  armored  vans,  and  mobile  tunnels  for  pro- 
tected entry  into  seized  buildings. 

Because  riot  police  duties  required  special  group  action,  units 
were  maintained  in  virtually  self-sufficient  compounds  and  trained 
to  work  as  a  coordinated  force.  The  overwhelming  majority  of 
officers  were  bachelors  who  lived  in  dormitories  within  riot  police 
compounds.  Training  was  constant  and  focused  on  physical 
conditioning,  mock  battles,  and  tactical  problems.  A  military  at- 
mosphere prevailed — dress  codes,  behavior  standards,  and  rank 
differentiations  were  more  strictly  adhered  to  than  in  the  regular 
police.  Esprit  de  corps  was  inculcated  with  regular  ceremonies  and 
institutionalization  of  rituals  such  as  applauding  personnel  dis- 
patched to  or  returning  from  assignments  and  formally  welcom- 
ing senior  officers  to  the  mess  hall  at  all  meals. 

Riot  duty  was  not  popular  because  it  entailed  special  sacrifices 
and  much  boredom  in  between  irregularly  spaced  actions.  Although 
many  police  were  assigned  riot  duty,  only  a  few  were  volunteers. 
For  many  personnel,  riot  duty  served  as  a  stepping  stone  because 
of  its  reputation  and  the  opportunities  it  presented  to  study  for  the 
advanced  police  examinations  necessary  for  promotion.  Because 
riot  duties  demanded  physical  fitness — the  armored  uniform 
weighed  6.6  kilograms — most  personnel  were  young,  often  serv- 
ing in  the  units  after  an  initial  assignment  in  a  koban. 

Special  Police 

In  addition  to  regular  police  officers,  there  were  several  thou- 
sand officials  attached  to  various  agencies  who  performed  special 
duties  relating  to  public  safety.  They  were  responsible  for  such  mat- 
ters as  railroad  security,  forest  preservation,  narcotics  control,  fish- 
ery inspection,  and  enforcement  of  regulations  on  maritime,  labor, 
and  mine  safety. 

In  1990,  the  largest  and  most  important  of  these  ministry- 
supervised  public  safety  agencies  was  the  Maritime  Safety  Agency, 
an  external  bureau  of  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  established 
to  deal  with  crime  in  coastal  waters  and  to  maintain  facilities  for 
safeguarding  navigation.  The  agency  operated  a  fleet  of  patrol  and 
rescue  craft  in  addition  to  a  few  aircraft  used  primarily  for  anti- 
smuggling  patrols  and  rescue  activities.  In  the  mid-1980s,  the  Mari- 
time Safety  Agency  annually  rescued  around  500  people  and 
arrested  another  500  for  violations  of  fishing  and  smuggling  laws. 


463 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

Other  agencies  with  limited  public  safety  functions  included  the 
Labor  Standards  Inspection  Office  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  rail- 
road police  of  Japan  Railways  Group,  immigration  agents  of  the 
Ministry  of  Justice,  postal  inspectors  of  the  Ministry  of  Posts  and 
Telecommunications,  and  revenue  inspectors  in  the  Ministry  of 
Finance. 

A  small  intelligence  agency,  the  Public  Security  Investigation 
Office  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice,  handled  national  security  mat- 
ters both  inside  and  outside  the  country.  Its  activities  were  not 
generally  known  to  the  public. 

Police-Community  Relations 

Despite  legal  limits  on  police  jurisdiction,  many  citizens  retained 
their  views  of  the  police  as  authority  figures  to  whom  they  could 
turn  for  aid.  The  public  often  sought  police  assistance  to  settle  fam- 
ily quarrels,  counsel  juveniles,  and  mediate  minor  disputes.  Citizens 
regularly  consulted  police  for  directions  to  hotels  and  residences — an 
invaluable  service  in  cities  where  streets  were  often  unnamed  and 
buildings  were  numbered  in  the  order  in  which  they  had  been  built 
rather  than  consecutively.  Police  were  encouraged  by  their  superiors 
to  view  these  tasks  as  answering  the  public's  demands  for  service 
and  as  inspiring  community  confidence  in  the  police.  Public  atti- 
tudes toward  the  police  were  generally  favorable,  although  a  se- 
ries of  incidents  of  forced  confessions  in  the  late  1980s  raised  some 
concern  about  police  treatment  of  suspects  held  for  pretrial  de- 
tention. 

Conditions  of  Service 

Education  was  highly  stressed  in  police  recruitment  and  promo- 
tion. Entrance  to  the  force  in  the  late  1980s  was  determined  by  ex- 
aminations administered  by  each  prefecture.  Examinees  were  divided 
into  two  groups:  upper- secondary- school  graduates  and  university 
graduates.  In  1985  there  were  ten  examinees  with  upper- secondary 
diplomas  and  six  with  university  degrees  for  every  job  opening. 
Recruits  underwent  rigorous  training — one  year  for  upper-secon- 
dary-school graduates  and  six  months  for  university  graduates — at 
the  residential  police  academy  attached  to  the  prefectural  headquar- 
ters. On  completion  of  basic  training,  most  police  officers  were  as- 
signed to  local  police  boxes.  Promotion  was  achieved  by  examination 
and  required  further  course  work.  In-service  training  provided  man- 
datory continuing  education  in  more  than  100  fields.  Police  officers 
with  upper- secondary- school  diplomas  were  eligible  to  take  the  ex- 
amination for  sergeant  after  three  years  of  on-the-job  experience. 
University  graduates  could  take  the  examination  after  only  one  year. 
University  graduates  were  also  eligible  to  take  the  examination  for

assistant  police  inspector,  police  inspector,  and  superintendent  after 
shorter  periods  than  upper-secondary-school  graduates.  There  were 
usually  five  to  fifteen  examinees  for  each  opening. 

About  fifteen  officers  per  year  passed  advanced  civil  service  ex- 
aminations and  were  admitted  as  senior  officers.  Officers  were 
groomed  for  administrative  positions  and,  although  some  rose 
through  the  ranks  to  become  senior  administrators,  most  such  po- 
sitions were  held  by  specially  recruited  senior  executives. 

The  police  forces  were  subject  to  external  oversight.  Although 
officials  of  the  National  Public  Safety  Commission  generally 
deferred  to  police  decisions  and  rarely  exercised  their  powers  to 
check  police  actions  or  operations,  police  were  liable  for  civil  and 
criminal  prosecution,  and  the  media  actively  publicized  police  mis- 
deeds. The  Human  Rights  Bureau  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice  solic- 
ited and  investigated  complaints  against  public  officials,  including 
police,  and  prefectural  legislatures  could  summon  police  chiefs  for 
questioning.  Social  sanctions  and  peer  pressure  also  constrained 
police  behavior.  As  in  other  occupational  groups  in  Japan,  police 
officers  developed  an  allegiance  to  their  own  group  and  a  reluc- 
tance to  offend  its  principles. 

The  Criminal  Justice  System 

Three  basic  features  of  the  nation's  system  of  criminal  justice 
characterized  its  operations  in  1990.  First,  the  institutions — police, 


465 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

government  prosecutor's  offices,  courts,  and  correctional  organs — 
maintained  close  and  cooperative  relations  with  each  other,  con- 
sulting frequently  on  how  best  to  accomplish  the  shared  goals  of 
limiting  and  controlling  crime.  Second,  citizens  were  encouraged 
to  assist  in  maintaining  public  order  and  they  participated  exten- 
sively in  crime  prevention  campaigns,  apprehension  of  suspects, 
and  offender  rehabilitation  programs.  Finally,  officials  who  ad- 
ministered criminal  justice  were  allowed  considerable  discretion  in 
dealing  with  offenders. 

Until  the  Meiji  Restoration  in  1868,  the  criminal  justice  system 
was  controlled  mainly  by  daimyo  (see  Rule  of  Shogun  and  Daimyo, 
ch.  1).  Public  officials,  not  laws,  guided  and  constrained  people 
to  conform  to  moral  norms.  In  accordance  with  the  Confucian  ideal, 
officials  were  to  serve  as  models  of  behavior;  the  people,  who  lacked 
rights  and  had  only  obligations,  were  expected  to  obey.  Such  laws 
as  did  exist  were  transmitted  through  local  military  officials  in  the 
form  of  local  domain  laws.  Specific  enforcement  varied  from  do- 
main to  domain,  and  no  formal  penal  codes  existed.  Justice  was 
generally  harsh,  and  severity  depended  upon  one's  status.  Kin  and 
neighbors  could  share  blame  for  an  offender's  guilt:  whole  fami- 
lies and  villages  could  be  flogged  or  put  to  death  for  one  member's 
transgression. 

After  1868  the  justice  system  underwent  rapid  transformation. 
The  first  publicly  promulgated  legal  codes,  the  Penal  Code  of  1880 
and  the  Code  of  Criminal  Instruction  of  1880,  were  based  on  French 
models.  Offenses  were  specified,  and  set  punishments  were  estab- 
lished for  particular  crimes.  Both  codes  were  innovative  in  that  they 
treated  all  citizens  as  equals,  provided  for  centralized  administra- 
tion of  criminal  justice,  and  prohibited  punishment  by  ex  post  facto 
law.  Guilt  was  held  to  be  personal;  collective  guilt  and  guilt  by  as- 
sociation were  abolished.  Offenses  against  the  emperor  were  spelled 
out  for  the  first  time. 

Innovative  aspects  of  the  codes  notwithstanding,  certain  provi- 
sions reflected  traditional  attitudes  toward  authority.  The  prose- 
cutor represented  the  state  and  sat  with  the  judge  on  a  raised 
platform — his  position  above  the  defendant  and  the  defense  coun- 
sel suggesting  their  relative  status.  Under  a  semi-inquisitorial  sys- 
tem, primary  responsibility  for  questioning  witnesses  lay  with  the 
judge,  and  defense  counsel  could  question  witnesses  only  through 
the  judge.  Cases  were  referred  to  trial  only  after  a  judge  presided 
over  a  preliminary  fact-finding  investigation  in  which  the  suspect 
was  not  permitted  counsel.  Because  in  all  trials  available  evidence 
had  already  convinced  the  court  in  a  preliminary  procedure,  the 


466 


National  Security 


defendant's  legal  presumption  of  innocence  at  trial  was  undermined 
and  the  legal  recourse  open  to  his  counsel  was  further  weakened. 

The  Penal  Code  was  substantially  revised  in  1907  to  reflect  the 
growing  influence  of  German  law  in  Japan,  and  the  French  prac- 
tice of  classifying  offenses  into  three  types  was  eliminated.  More 
importantly,  where  the  old  code  had  allowed  very  limited  judicial 
discretion,  the  new  one  permitted  the  judge  to  apply  a  wide  range 
of  subjective  factors  in  sentencing. 

After  World  War  II,  occupation  authorities  initiated  reform  of 
the  Constitution  and  laws  in  general.  Except  for  omitting  offenses 
relating  to  war,  the  imperial  family,  and  adultery,  the  1947  Penal 
Code  remains  virtually  identical  to  the  1907  version.  The  crimi- 
nal procedure  code,  however,  was  substantially  revised  to  incor- 
porate rules  guaranteeing  the  rights  of  the  accused.  The  system 
became  almost  completely  accusatorial,  and  the  judge,  although 
still  able  to  question  witnesses,  decided  a  case  on  evidence  presented 
by  both  sides.  The  preliminary  investigative  procedure  was  sup- 
pressed. The  prosecutor  and  defense  counsel  sat  on  equal  levels, 
below  the  judge.  Laws  on  indemnification  of  the  wrongly  accused, 
juveniles,  prisons,  probation,  and  minor  offenses  were  also  passed 
in  the  postwar  years  to  supplement  criminal  justice  administration. 

Crime 

The  National  Police  Agency  divided  crime  into  six  main  cate- 
gories. Felonious  offenses — the  most  serious  and  carrying  the  stiffest 
penalties — included  murder  and  conspiracy  to  murder,  robbery, 
rape,  and  arson.  Violent  offenses  consisted  of  unlawful  assembly 
while  possessing  dangerous  weapons,  simple  and  aggravated  as- 
sault, extortion,  and  intimidation.  Larceny  encompassed  burglary, 
vehicle  theft,  and  shoplifting.  Crimes  classified  as  intellectual  in- 
cluded fraud,  embezzlement,  counterfeiting,  forgery,  bribery,  and 
breach  of  trust.  Moral  offenses  included  gambling,  indecent  ex- 
posure, and  the  distribution  of  obscene  literature.  Miscellaneous 
offenses  frequently  involved  the  obstruction  of  official  duties,  negli- 
gence with  fire,  unauthorized  entry,  negligent  homicide  or  injury 
(often  in  traffic  accidents),  possession  of  stolen  property,  and  de- 
struction of  property.  Special  laws  defined  other  criminal  offenses, 
among  them  prostitution,  illegal  possession  of  swords  and  firearms, 
customs  violations,  and  possession  of  controlled  substances  including 
narcotics  and  marijuana. 

In  1986  the  police  identified  over  2.1  million  Penal  Code  viola- 
tions. Two  types  of  violations — larceny  (64.7  percent  of  total  vio- 
lations) and  negligent  homicide  or  injury  as  a  result  of  accidents 
(25.6  percent) — accounted  for  over  90  percent  of  criminal  offenses

in  Japan  in  1986.  Major  crimes  occurred  in  Japan  at  a  very  low 
rate.  Japan  experienced  1 .6  robberies  per  100,000  population,  com- 
pared with  46.8  for  West  Germany,  60.1  for  Britain,  and  225.1 
for  the  United  States;  and  1.4  murders  per  100,000  population, 
compared  with  4.5  for  West  Germany,  4.3  for  Britain,  and  8.6 
for  the  United  States.  Japanese  authorities  also  solved  a  high  per- 
centage of  robbery  cases  (78.5  percent  compared  with  48.4  per- 
cent for  West  Germany,  20.4  percent  for  Britain,  and  24.7  percent 
for  the  United  States)  and  homicide  cases  (96.7  percent  compared 
with  93.9  percent  for  West  Germany,  76.7  percent  for  Britain,  and 
70.2  percent  for  the  United  States). 

An  important  factor  keeping  crime  low  was  the  traditional  em- 
phasis on  the  individual  as  a  member  of  groups  to  which  he  or  she 
must  not  bring  shame.  Within  these  groups — family,  friends,  as- 
sociates at  work  or  school — a  Japanese  had  social  rights  and  obli- 
gations, derived  valued  emotional  support,  and  met  powerful 
expectations  to  conform.  In  1990  these  informal  social  sanctions 
continued  to  display  remarkable  potency  despite  competing  values 
in  a  changing  society.  Other  important  factors  keeping  the  crime 
rate  low  were  the  prosperous  economy  and  a  strict  and  effective 
weapons  control  law.  Ownership  of  handguns  was  forbidden  to  the 
public,  hunting  rifles  and  ceremonial  swords  were  registered  with 
the  police,  and  the  manufacture  and  sale  of  firearms  were  regu- 
lated. The  production  and  sale  of  live  and  blank  ammunition  were 
also  controlled,  as  were  the  transportation  and  importation  of  all 
weapons.  In  the  late  1980s,  crimes  were  seldom  committed  with 
firearms. 

Despite  Japan's  status  as  a  modern,  urban  nation — a  condition 
linked  by  many  criminologists  to  growing  rates  of  crime — the  na- 
tion did  not  suffer  from  steadily  rising  levels  of  criminal  activity. 
Although  crime  continued  to  be  higher  in  urban  areas,  in  the  1980s 
rates  of  crime  remained  relatively  constant  nationwide,  and  rates 
of  violent  crime  continued  to  decrease. 

The  nation  was  not  problem-free,  however;  of  particular  con- 
cern to  the  police  were  crimes  associated  with  modernization.  In- 
creased wealth  and  technological  sophistication  brought  new 
white-collar  crimes,  such  as  computer  and  credit  card  fraud,  larceny 
involving  coin  dispensers,  and  insurance  falsification.  Incidence 
of  drug  abuse  was  minuscule  compared  with  other  industrialized 
nations  and  limited  mainly  to  stimulants.  Japanese  law  enforce- 
ment authorities  endeavored  to  control  this  problem  by  extensive 
coordination  with  international  investigative  organizations  and 
stringent  punishment  of  Japanese  and  foreign  offenders.  Traffic 


468 


National  Security 


accidents  and  fatalities  in  the  late  1980s  continued  to  consume  sub- 
stantial law  enforcement  resources. 

Juvenile  delinquency,  although  not  nearly  as  serious  as  in  most 
industrialized  nations,  was  a  great  concern  to  authorities.  In  1986 
over  46  percent  of  persons  arrested  for  criminal  offenses  (other  than 
negligent  homicide  or  injuries)  were  juveniles.  Over  75  percent  of 
the  juveniles  arrested  were  charged  with  larceny,  mainly  shoplift- 
ing and  theft  of  motorcycles  and  bicycles.  The  failure  of  the  Japanese 
education  system  to  address  the  concerns  of  nonuniversity-bound 
students  was  cited  as  an  important  factor  in  the  rise  of  juvenile  crime 
(see  Primary  and  Secondary  Education,  ch.  3). 

Yakuza  (underworld)  groups  were  estimated  to  number  more  than 
3,100  and  together  contained  almost  86,000  members.  Although 
concentrated  in  the  largest  urban  prefectures,  yakuza  operated  in 
most  cities  and  often  received  protection  from  high-ranking  offi- 
cials in  exchange  for  their  assistance  in  keeping  the  crime  rate  low 
by  discouraging  criminals  operating  individually  or  in  small  groups. 
Following  concerted  police  pressure  in  the  1960s,  smaller  gangs 
either  disappeared  or  began  to  consolidate  in  syndicate-type  or- 
ganizations. In  1986  three  large  syndicates  dominated  underworld 
crime  in  the  nation  and  controlled  more  than  1,000  gangs  and 
29,000  gangsters. 

Yakuza  had  existed  in  Japan  well  before  the  1800s  and  followed 
codes  based  on  bushido.  Their  early  operations  were  usually  close- 
knit,  and  the  leader  and  gang  members  had  father- son  relation- 
ships. Although  this  traditional  arrangement  continued  to  exist, 
yakuza  activities  were  increasingly  replaced  by  modern  types  of  gangs 
that  depended  on  force  and  money  as  organizing  concepts.  Nonethe- 
less, yakuza  often  pictured  themselves  as  saviors  of  traditional 
Japanese  virtues  in  a  postwar  society,  sometimes  forming  ties  with 
right-wing  groups  espousing  the  same  views  and  attracting  dissatis- 
fied youths  to  their  ranks. 

Civil  Disturbances 

The  public  and  government  appeared  to  tolerate  certain  forms 
of  public  disorder  as  inherent  to  a  properly  functioning  democracy. 
Demonstrations  usually  followed  established  forms.  Groups  received 
legal  permits  and  kept  to  assigned  routes  and  areas.  Placards  and 
bullhorns  were  used  to  express  positions.  Traffic  was  sometimes 
disrupted,  and  occasional  shoving  battles  between  police  and  pro- 
testers resulted.  But  arrests  were  rare  and  generally  made  only  in 
cases  involving  violence. 

Political  extremists  have  not  hesitated  to  use  violence  and  were 
held  responsible  for  bombings  in  connection  with  popular  causes.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

In  January  1990  the  mayor  of  Nagasaki  was  shot  by  a  member 
of  the  right-wing  Seikijuku  (Sane  Thinkers  School),  presumably 
for  a  statement  he  had  made  that  was  perceived  as  critical  of  the 
late  Emperor  Hirohito.  That  attack  came  two  days  after  the  left- 
wing  Chukakuha  (Middle  Core  Faction),  opposed  to  the  imperial 
system,  claimed  responsibility  for  firing  a  rocket  onto  the  grounds 
of  the  residence  of  the  late  emperor's  brother  and  a  day  before  the 
government  announced  the  events  leading  to  the  enthronement  of 
Emperor  Akihito  in  November  1990.  The  enthronement  ceremonies 
were  considered  likely  targets  for  extremist  groups  on  the  left  and 
the  right  who  saw  the  mysticism  surrounding  the  emperor  as  being 
overemphasized  or  excessively  reduced,  respectively.  Although 
membership  in  these  groups  represented  only  a  minute  portion  of 
the  population  and  presented  no  serious  threat  to  the  government, 
authorities  were  concerned  about  the  example  set  by  the  groups' 
violence,  as  well  as  by  the  particular  violent  events.  Violent  pro- 
test by  radicals  also  occurred  in  the  name  of  causes  apparently  iso- 
lated from  public  sentiments.  Occasional  clashes  between  leftist 
factions  and  between  leftists  and  rightists  have  injured  both  par- 
ticipants and  bystanders.  Security  in  the  early  1990s  remained  heavy 
at  New  Tokyo  International  Airport  at  Narita-Sanrizuka  in  Chiba 
Prefecture,  the  scene  of  violent  protests  in  the  1970s  by  radical 
groups  supporting  local  farmers  opposed  to  expropriation  of  their 
land. 

The  most  notorious  extremists  were  the  Japanese  Red  Army, 
a  Marxist  terrorist  group  (see  Political  Extremists,  ch.  6).  This 
group  was  responsible  for  an  attack  on  Lod  International  Airport 
in  Tel  Aviv,  Israel,  in  support  of  the  Popular  Front  for  the  Liber- 
ation of  Palestine  in  1972.  It  participated  in  an  attack  on  a  Shell 
Oil  refinery  in  Singapore  in  1974  and  seized  the  French  embassy 
in  The  Hague  that  same  year  and  the  United  States  and  Swedish 
embassies  in  Kuala  Lumpur  in  1975.  In  1977  the  Japanese  Red 
Army  hijacked  a  Japan  Airlines  jet  over  India  in  a  successful  de- 
mand for  a  US$6  million  ransom  and  the  release  of  six  inmates 
in  Japanese  prisons.  Following  heavy  criticism  at  home  and  abroad 
for  the  government's  "caving  in"  to  terrorists'  demands,  the 
authorities  announced  their  intention  to  recall  and  reissue  approx- 
imately 5.6  million  valid  Japanese  passports  to  make  hijacking  more 
difficult.  A  special  police  unit  was  formed  to  keep  track  of  the  ter- 
rorist group,  and  tight  airport  security  measures  were  instigated. 
Despite  issuing  regular  threats,  the  Japanese  Red  Army  was  rela- 
tively inactive  in  the  1980s.  In  1990  its  members  were  reported 
to  be  in  North  Korea  and  Lebanon  undergoing  further  training 
and  available  as  mercenaries  to  promote  various  political  causes.

National  Security 


Criminal  Procedure 

In  1990  the  nation's  criminal  justice  officials  followed  specified 
legal  procedures  in  dealing  with  offenders.  Once  a  suspect  was  ar- 
rested by  national  or  prefectural  police,  the  case  was  turned  over 
to  attorneys  in  the  Supreme  Public  Prosecutors  Office,  who  were 
the  government's  sole  agents  in  prosecuting  lawbreakers.  Although 
under  Ministry  of  Justice's  administration,  these  officials  worked 
under  Supreme  Court  rules  and  were  career  civil  servants  who  could 
be  removed  from  office  only  for  incompetence  or  impropriety. 
Prosecutors  presented  the  government's  case  before  judges  in  the 
Supreme  Court  and  the  four  types  of  lower  courts:  high  courts, 
district  courts,  summary  courts,  and  family  courts.  Penal  and  pro- 
bation officials  administered  programs  for  convicted  offenders  under 
the  direction  of  public  prosecutors  (see  The  Judicial  System,  ch.  6). 

After  identifying  a  suspect,  police  had  the  authority  to  exercise 
some  discretion  in  determining  the  next  step.  If,  in  cases  pertain- 
ing to  theft,  the  amount  was  small  or  already  returned,  the  offense 
petty,  the  victim  unwilling  to  press  charges,  the  act  accidental,  or 
the  likelihood  of  a  repetition  not  great,  the  police  could  either  drop 
the  case  or  turn  it  over  to  a  prosecutor.  Reflecting  the  belief  that 
appropriate  remedies  were  sometimes  best  found  outside  the  for- 
mal criminal  justice  mechanisms,  in  1987  approximately  49  per- 
cent of  criminal  cases  were  not  sent  to  the  prosecutor. 

Police  also  exercised  wide  discretion  in  matters  concerning 
juveniles.  Police  were  instructed  by  law  to  identify  and  counsel 
minors  who  appeared  likely  to  commit  crimes,  and  they  could  refer 
juvenile  offenders  and  nonoffenders  alike  to  child  guidance  centers 
to  be  treated  on  an  outpatient  basis.  Police  could  also  assign 
juveniles  or  those  considered  to  be  harming  the  welfare  of  juveniles 
to  special  family  courts.  These  courts  were  established  in  1949  in 
the  belief  that  the  adjustment  of  a  family's  situation  was  sometimes 
required  to  protect  children  and  prevent  juvenile  delinquency.  Fam- 
ily courts  were  run  in  closed  sessions,  tried  juvenile  offenders  under 
special  laws,  and  operated  extensive  probationary  guidance  pro- 
grams. Young  people  between  the  ages  of  fourteen  and  twenty 
could,  at  the  judgment  of  police,  be  sent  to  the  public  prosecutor 
for  possible  trial  as  adults  before  a  judge  under  the  general  crimi- 
nal law. 

Safeguards  protected  the  suspects'  rights.  Police  had  to  secure 
warrants  to  search  for  or  seize  evidence.  A  warrant  was  also  neces- 
sary for  an  arrest,  although  if  the  crime  were  very  serious  or  the 
perpetrator  likely  to  flee,  it  could  be  obtained  immediately  after 
arrest.  Within  forty-eight  hours  after  placing  a  suspect  under 


471 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 


detention,  the  police  had  to  present  their  case  before  a  prosecutor, 
who  was  then  required  to  apprise  the  accused  of  the  charges  and 
of  the  right  to  counsel.  Within  another  twenty-four  hours,  the  prose- 
cutor had  to  go  before  a  judge  and  present  a  case  to  obtain  a  de- 
tention order.  Suspects  could  be  held  for  ten  days  (extensions  were 
granted  in  special  cases),  pending  an  investigation  and  a  decision 
whether  or  not  to  prosecute.  In  the  1980s,  some  suspects  were 
reported  to  have  been  mistreated  during  this  detention  to  exact  a 
confession. 

Prosecution  could  be  denied  on  the  grounds  of  insufficient  evi- 
dence or  on  the  prosecutor's  judgment.  Under  Article  248  of  the 
Code  of  Criminal  Procedures,  the  prosecutor,  after  weighing  the 
offender's  age,  character,  and  environment,  the  circumstances  and 
gravity  of  the  crime,  and  the  accused's  rehabilitative  potential,  did 
not  have  to  institute  public  action,  but  could  deny  or  suspend  and 
ultimately  drop  the  charges  after  a  probationary  period.  Because 
the  investigation  and  disposition  of  a  case  could  occur  behind  closed 
doors  and  the  identity  of  an  accused  person  who  was  not  prose- 
cuted was  rarely  made  public,  an  offender  could  successfully  reenter 
society  and  be  rehabilitated  under  probationary  status  without  the 
stigma  of  a  criminal  conviction. 

Institutional  safeguards  checked  the  prosecutors'  discretionary 
powers  not  to  prosecute.  Lay  committees  were  established  in  con- 
junction with  branch  courts  to  hold  inquests  on  a  prosecutor's  de- 
cisions. These  committees  met  four  times  yearly  and  could  order 
that  a  case  be  reinvestigated  and  prosecuted.  Victims  or  interested 
parties  could  also  appeal  a  decision  not  to  prosecute. 

Most  offenses  were  tried  first  in  district  courts  before  one  or  three 
judges,  depending  on  the  severity  of  the  case.  Defendants  were  pro- 
tected from  self-incrimination,  forced  confession,  and  unrestricted 
admission  of  hearsay  evidence.  In  addition,  defendants  had  the  right 
to  counsel,  public  trial,  and  cross-examination.  Trial  by  jury  was 
authorized  by  the  1923  Jury  Law  but  was  suspended  in  1943.  It 
had  not  been  reinstated  as  of  1990,  chiefly  owing  to  defendants' 
distrust  of  jurors,  who  were  believed  to  be  emotional  and  easily 
influenced,  and  the  generally  greater  public  confidence  in  the  com- 
petence of  judges. 

The  judge  conducted  the  trial  and  was  authorized  to  question 
witnesses,  independently  call  for  evidence,  decide  guilt,  and  affix 
a  sentence.  The  judge  could  also  suspend  any  sentence  or  place 
a  convicted  party  on  probation.  Should  a  judgment  of  not  guilty 
be  rendered,  the  accused  was  entitled  to  compensation  by  the  state 
based  on  the  number  of  days  spent  in  detention.

National  Security 


Criminal  cases  from  summary  courts,  family  courts,  and  dis- 
trict courts  could  be  appealed  to  the  high  courts  by  both  the  prose- 
cution and  the  defense.  Criminal  appeal  to  the  Supreme  Court  was 
limited  to  constitutional  questions  and  a  conflict  of  precedent  be- 
tween the  Supreme  Court  and  high  courts. 

The  criminal  code  set  minimum  and  maximum  sentences  for 
offenses  to  allow  for  the  varying  circumstances  of  each  crime  and 
criminal.  Penalties  ranged  from  fines  and  short-term  incarceration 
to  compulsory  labor  and  the  death  penalty.  Heavier  penalties  were 
meted  out  to  repeat  offenders.  Capital  punishment  consisted  of 
death  by  hanging  and  could  be  imposed  on  those  convicted  of  lead- 
ing an  insurrection,  inducing  or  aiding  foreign  armed  aggression, 
arson,  or  homicide. 

The  Penal  System 

Prisons,  in  existence  in  some  feudal  domains  as  early  as  the  late 
sixteenth  century,  originally  functioned  to  hold  people  for  trial  or 
prior  to  execution.  Because  of  the  costs  and  difficulties  involved 
in  long-term  incarceration  and  the  prevailing  standards  of  justice 
that  called  for  sentences  of  death  or  exile  for  serious  crimes,  life 
imprisonment  was  rare.  Facilities  were  used  sometimes  for  shorter 
confinement.  Prisoners  were  treated  according  to  their  social  sta- 
tus and  housed  in  barracks-like  quarters  (see  Seclusion  and  Social 
Control,  ch.  1).  In  some  cases  the  position  of  prison  officer  was 
hereditary,  and  staff  vacancies  were  filled  by  relatives. 

During  the  Meiji  period  (1868-1912),  the  country  adopted 
Western-style  penology  along  with  systems  of  law  and  legal  adminis- 
tration. In  1888  an  aftercare  hostel  (halfway  house)  was  opened 
for  released  prisoners.  Staffed  mainly  by  volunteers,  this  institu- 
tion helped  ex-convicts  reenter  society.  Many  ex-convicts  had  been 
ostracized  by  their  families  for  the  shame  they  had  incurred  and 
had  literally  nowhere  to  go.  The  Prison  Law  of  1908  provided  basic 
rules  and  regulations  for  prison  administration,  stipulating  separate 
facilities  for  those  sentenced  to  confinement  with  and  without  labor, 
and  for  those  detained  for  trial  and  short  sentences. 

The  Juvenile  Law  of  1922  established  administrative  organs  to 
handle  offenders  under  the  age  of  eighteen  and  recognized  volun- 
teer workers  officially  as  the  major  forces  in  the  community-based 
treatment  of  juveniles.  After  World  War  II  juvenile  laws  were  re- 
vised to  extend  their  jurisdiction  to  those  under  the  age  of  twenty. 
Volunteer  workers  were  reorganized  under  a  new  law  and  in  1990 
remained  an  indispensable  part  of  the  rehabilitation  system. 

The  Correctional  Bureau  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice  administered 
the  adult  prison  system  as  well  as  the  juvenile  correctional  system 


473 


Japan:  A  Country  Study 

and  three  women's  guidance  homes  (to  rehabilitate  prostitutes). 
The  ministry's  Rehabilitation  Bureau  operated  the  probation  and 
parole  systems.  Prison  personnel  were  trained  at  an  institute  in 
Tokyo  and  in  branch  training  institutes  in  each  of  the  eight  regional 
correctional  headquarters  under  the  Correctional  Bureau.  Profes- 
sional probation  officers  studied  at  the  Legal  Training  and  Research 
Institute  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Japan's  prison  population  stood  at  somewhat 
more  than  55,000  (about  44  per  100,000  general  population),  nearly 
9,000  in  short-term  detention  centers,  the  remaining  46,000  in  pri- 
sons. Approximately  45  percent  were  repeat  offenders.  The  United 
States  during  that  period  had  a  prison  population  of  approximately 
1  million  (about  500  per  100,000  general  population)  with  nearly 
90  percent  repeat  offenders.  While  the  high  recidivism  in  the  United 
States  prison  system  was  blamed  on  its  failure  to  reform  offenders, 
Japanese  recidivism  was  attributed  mainly  to  the  discretionary  pow- 
ers of  police,  prosecutors,  and  courts,  and  the  tendency  to  seek 
alternative  sentences  for  first  offenders. 

The  penal  system  was  intended  to  resocialize,  reform,  and  re- 
habilitate offenders.  On  confinement,  prisoners  were  first  classi- 
fied according  to  sex,  nationality,  kind  of  penalty,  length  of 
sentence,  degree  of  criminality,  and  state  of  physical  and  mental 
health.  They  were  then  placed  in  special  programs  designed  to  treat 
individual  needs.  Vocational  and  formal  education  were  empha- 
sized, as  was  instruction  in  social  values.  Most  convicts  engaged 
in  labor  for  which  a  small  stipend  was  set  aside  for  use  on  release. 
Under  a  system  stressing  incentives,  prisoners  were  initially  assigned 
to  community  cells,  then  earned  better  quarters  and  additional 
privileges  based  on  their  good  behavior. 

Although  a  few  juvenile  offenders  were  handled  under  the  general 
penal  system,  most  were  treated  in  separate  juvenile  training 
schools.  More  lenient  than  the  penal  institutions,  these  facilities 
provided  correctional  education  and  regular  schooling  for  delin- 
quents under  the  age  of  twenty. 

According  to  the  Ministry  of  Justice,  the  government's  respon- 
sibility for  social  order  did  not  end  with  imprisoning  an  offender, 
but  also  extended  to  aftercare  treatment  and  to  noninstitutional 
treatment  to  substitute  for  or  supplement  prison  terms.  A  large 
number  of  those  given  suspended  sentences  were  released  to  the 
supervision  of  volunteer  officers  under  the  guidance  of  professional 
probation  officers.  Adults  were  usually  placed  on  probation  for  a 
fixed  period  and  juveniles  until  they  reached  the  age  of  twenty. 
Volunteers  were  also  used  in  supervising  parolees,  though  profes- 
sional probation  officers  generally  supervised  offenders  considered

to  have  a  high  risk  of  recidivism.  Volunteers  hailed  from  all  walks 
of  life  and  handled  no  more  than  five  cases  at  one  time.  They  were 
responsible  for  overseeing  the  offenders'  conduct  to  prevent  the 
occurrence  of  further  offenses.  Volunteer  probation  officers  also 
offered  guidance  and  assistance  to  the  ex-convict  in  assuming  a 
law-abiding  place  in  the  community.  Although  volunteers  were 
sometimes  criticized  for  being  too  old  compared  to  their  charges 
(more  than  70  percent  were  retired,  aged  fifty-five  or  over)  and 
so  unable  to  understand  the  problems  they  faced,  most  authorities 
believed  that  the  volunteers  were  critically  important  in  the  na- 
tion's criminal  justice  system. 

Public  support  and  cooperation  with  law  enforcement  officials 
helped  in  holding  down  Japan's  crime  rate,  with  little  or  no  threat 
to  internal  security.  The  external  security  threat  in  1990  was  also 
considerably  reduced  from  previous  years.  The  Japanese  govern- 
ment was  confident  that  diplomatic  activity  and  a  limited  SDF, 
backed  by  United  States  treaty  commitments,  would  be  sufficient 
to  deter  any  potential  adversary. 

*    *  * 

The  most  comprehensive  treatment  of  the  SDF  is  available  in 
Jieitai  nenkan  (Self-Defense  Forces  Yearbook),  the  annual  white  paper 
published  by  Defense  Daily,  and  Defense  of  Japan,  published  by  the 
Japanese  Defense  Agency.  Other  sources  include  James  H.  Buck's 
The  Modern  Japanese  Military  System,  Harrison  M.  Holland's  Managing 
Defense:  Japan's  Dilemma,  and  Malcolm  Mcintosh's  Japan  Re-armed. 
The  International  Institute  for  Strategic  Studies'  annual,  The  Mili- 
tary Balance,  provides  current  data  on  the  size,  budget,  and  equip- 
ment inventory  of  the  armed  forces.  Reinhard  Drifte's  Arms 
Production  in  Japan  gives  insight  into  Japan's  developing  defense  in- 
dustry. 

The  Police  of  fapan,  published  by  the  National  Police  Agency,  gives 
an  excellent  overview  of  the  police  system  and  Keisatsu  hakusho  (Police 
White  Paper),  published  annually  by  the  same  agency,  gives  up- 
dated law  enforcement  information  and  crime  figures. 

Journals  such  as  Japan  Quarterly  [Tokyo],  Far  Eastern  Economic 
Review  [Hong  Kong] ,  and  Summaries  of  Selected  Japanese  Magazines 
(issued  monthly  by  the  United  States  Embassy  in  Tokyo)  frequently 
cover  issues  in  defense  and  internal  security  and  public  order.  (For

Glossary 


Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN) — Established  in 
1967  to  foster  cooperation  in  food  production,  industry  and 
commerce,  civil  aviation,  shipping,  tourism,  communications, 
meteorology,  science  and  technology,  and  Southeast  Asian 
studies.  The  charter  members  were  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the 
Philippines,  Singapore,  and  Thailand.  Brunei  was  admitted 
in  1984.  Papua  New  Guinea  has  observer  status. 

Bretton  Woods  System — A  structure  of  fixed  exchange  rates  de- 
veloped at  the  1944  Bretton  Woods  Conference,  which  estab- 
lished the  International  Monetary  Fund  (q.  v. )  and  the  World 
Bank  (q.v.),  and  was  in  effect  until  1971. 

bushido — Literally,  the  way  of  the  warrior  (samurai),  a  term  ap- 
plied to  the  principles  of  loyalty  and  honor;  a  code  of  stoic  en- 
durance, scorn  of  danger  and  death,  religious  worship  of 
country  and  sovereign,  and  proper  social  relationships;  an  aes- 
thetic life- style. 

Diet — The  national  legislature.  From  1890  to  1947,  known  as  the 
Imperial  Diet  (in  Japanese,  Teikoku  Gikai)  with  the  appointed 
House  of  Peers  and  the  elected  House  of  Representatives;  since 
1947,  the  National  Diet  or  Diet  (in  Japanese,  Kokkai)  with  the 
House  of  Councillors  and  the  House  of  Representatives,  both 
of  which  are  elected.  The  word  diet  comes  from  the  Latin  dies 
(day),  a  reference  to  the  period  of  time  for  which  a  court  or 
assembly  met.

General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT) — An  interna- 
tional instrument,  under  United  Nations  (UN)  auspices,  es- 
tablishing rules  of  trade  accepted  by  countries  responsible  for 
most  of  the  world's  trade;  came  into  effect  in  1948.  Since  1968 
has  operated  in  conjunction  with  the  UN  Conference  on  Trade 
and  Development  (UNCTAD)  to  provide  information  and 
training  on  export  markets,  marketing  techniques,  and  trade 
policy  issues.  GATT  members  have  met  in  a  series  of  "rounds" 
for  multilateral  trade  negotiations  since  1964.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) — Established  along  with  the 
World  Bank  (q.  v.)  in  1945,  the  IMF  is  a  specialized  agency 
affiliated  with  the  United  Nations  and  is  responsible  for  stabiliz- 
ing international  exchange  loans  to  its  members  (including  in- 
dustrialized and  developing  countries)  when  they  experience 
balance  of  payments  difficulties.  These  loans  frequently  carry 
conditions  that  require  substantial  internal  economic  adjust- 
ments by  the  recipients,  most  of  which  are  developing  countries. 

juku — Privately  established  schools  that  teach  either  academic  or 
nonacademic  subjects.  Academic^a  offer  tutorial,  enrichment, 
remedial,  and  examination  preparatory  classes  that  supplement 
regular  school  work.  Most  hold  classes  after  school  and/or  on 
weekends. 

Nihon  (or  Nippon) — The  official  pronunciation  of  the  two  Chinese 
ideographs  (rtben  in  piny  in  romanization,  literally,  source  of 
the  sun)  comprising  the  name  Japan,  as  designated  by  the 
Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science,  is  Nippon  (or 
in  full,  Nippon  Koku — Nippon  country).  The  common  pronun- 
ciation in  everyday  usage,  however,  is  Nihon  (Nihon  Koku). 
The  use  of  Nihon  antedates  Prince  Shotoku's  seventh-century 
reference  to  himself  as  the  Son  of  Heaven  of  the  Land  of  the 
Rising  Sun  and  possibly  dates  from  the  establishment  of  the 
Nihon-fu  (Japan  Office)  in  the  Yamato  (q.  v. )  colony  in  southern 
Korea  that  served  as  a  liaison  office  of  the  Yamato  court  to 
the  Chinese  court,  probably  as  early  as  the  sixth  century.  Marco 
Polo,  or  his  scribe,  referred  to  Zipangu  (Ribenguo  in  pinyin 
romanization),  which  has  variously  appeared  as  Cipango, 
Jipangu,  and  Jipan,  from  which  the  current  spelling  of  Japan 
undoubtedly  descends. 

Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development 
(OECD) — Established  in  1961  to  promote  economic  and  so- 
cial welfare  among  member  countries  (in  1990,  Australia,  Aus- 
tria, Belgium,  Britain,  Canada,  Denmark,  Federal  Republic 
of  Germany,  Finland,  France,  Greece,  Iceland,  Ireland,  Italy, 
Japan,  Luxembourg,  the  Netherlands,  New  Zealand,  Norway, 
Portugal,  Spain,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  Turkey,  and  the  United 
States)  by  assisting  member  governments  in  the  formulation 
and  coordination  of  policy;  and  to  encourage  member-nation 
support  of  developing  (Third  World)  nations. 

ronin — Originally,  a  "wave  person"  or  a  masterless  samurai,  who 
has  left  the  service  of  his  lord,  either  by  choice  or  forced  cir- 
cumstances, and  serves  others  with  his  bold  and  sometimes 
desperate  deeds.  In  contemporary  Japan,  a  student  who  has 
failed  the  entrance  examination  to  the  institution  of  choice  and 


574 


Glossary 


has  chosen  to  spend  an  additional  year  or  more  in  study  to  take 
the  examination  again. 
seppuku — either  voluntary  (to  expiate  serious  failure)  or  obligatory 
suicide  (instead  of  execution)  to  regain  one's  honor  in  death. 
A  privilege  reserved  for  the  samurai  class.  Commonly  referred 
to  as  hara-kiri. 

World  Bank — Informal  name  used  to  designate  a  group  of  three 
affiliated  international  institutions:  the  International  Bank  for 
Reconstruction  and  Development  (IBRD),  the  International 
Development  Association  (IDA),  and  the  International  Finance 
Corporation  (IFC).  The  IBRD,  established  in  1945,  has  the 
primary  purpose  of  providing  loans  to  developing  countries  for 
productive  projects.  The  IDA,  a  legally  separate  loan  fund  but 
administered  by  the  staff  of  the  IBRD,  was  set  up  in  1960  to 
furnish  credits  to  the  poorest  developing  countries  on  much  eas- 
ier terms  than  those  of  conventional  IBRD  loans.  The  IFC, 
founded  in  1956,  supplements  the  activities  of  the  IBRD 
through  loans  and  assistance  designed  specifically  to  encourage 
the  growth  of  productive  private  enterprises  in  the  less  devel- 
oped countries.  The  president  and  certain  senior  officers  of  the 
IBRD  hold  the  same  positions  in  the  IFC .  The  three  institu- 
tions are  owned  by  the  governments  of  the  countries  that  sub- 
scribe their  capital.  To  participate  in  the  World  Bank  group, 
member  states  must  first  belong  to  the  International  Mone- 
tary Fund  (IMF — q.v.). 

Yamato — Refers  to  the  country  of  Japan  or  things  Japanese,  such 
as  yamato-e  (Japanese  painting)  and  to  the  ancient  court  from 
which  the  imperial  family  rose.  The  Yamato  court  was  situated 
either  in  modern  Nara  Prefecture,  from  the  early  fourth  cen- 
tury A.D. ,  or  in  northern  Kyushu,  starting  perhaps  in  the  early 
third  century  A.D. 

yen  (¥) — The  national  currency,  in  coins  of  1,  5,  10,  and  100  yen 
and  notes  of  500,  1,000,  5,000,  and  10,000  yen.  From  1945 
to  1971,  Japan  maintained  a  fixed  parity  to  the  United  States 
dollar  of  US$1  =  ¥360.  After  a  period  of  adjustment  during  the 
financial  crises  of  the  1971-73  period,  the  value  has  floated  ac- 
cording to  movements  in  the  international  capital  markets.  The 
exchange  rate  in  August  1990  was  ¥147  =  US$1 .  Fluctuations 
in  recent  years  have  been  considerable,  producing  exchange 
rates  for  US$1  of  ¥142  (August  1989),  ¥134  (August  1988), 
¥149  (August  1987),  ¥155  (August  1986),  and  ¥239  (August 
1985) 

yobiko — A  type  of  private  school  that  specializes  in  preparing  high- 
school  graduates  for  university-entrance  examinations,  often 
through  intensive  full-time  programs.

Japan:  A  Country  Study 

zaibatsu — Literally,  ' 'wealth  group."  Zaibatsu  were  powerful  indus- 
trial or  financial  combines  that  merged  during  the  Meiji  era 
and  were  implicated  in  the  militarist  regimes  of  the  1930s  and 
1940s.  They  were  an  amalgamation  of  sometimes  hundreds  of 
businesses  controlled  by  a  holding  company  owned  by  a  single 
family.  The  major  zaibatsu  were  Mitsui,  Mitsubishi,  Sumimoto, 
and  Yasuda.  The  zaibatsu  were  abolished  in  1945  and  1946. 
After  1947,  numerous  companies  formerly  controlled  by  zaibatsu 
came  together  as  keiretsu  (enterprise  groups) — conglomerates 
no  longer  controlled  by  a  singe  family  and  whose  individual 
member  companies  had  greater  autonomy  than  they  had  had 
as  part  of  a  zaibatsu.
