The  Beer  Drinking  Theme 
in  Tacitus’  Germania 

Bernhard  Bierschenk 


Abstract  While  there  are  a number  of  archaeological  references  to  brewing  of  beer  as  early  as 
1200  BC,  there  are  besides  picturing  drinking-horns,  no  references  to  early  drinking  customs. 
Fortunately,  significant  similarities  among  the  Germanic  tribes  have  been  noted  as  early  as 
about  100  AC  which  suggest  commonalty  in  drinking  as  a formal  ritual  activity.  Tacitus’ 
writing  about  beer  drinking  can  be  tested  against  the  hypothesis  of  Charles  Choi  (2010)  that 
‘Beer  Lubricated  the  Rise  of  Civilization’.  It  will  be  made  evident  that  state  attractions  can  be 
established  by  applying  the  procedures,  outlined  in  the  manuals  of  Perspective  Text  Analysis. 
However,  the  presentation  of  the  obtained  results  through  energy  landscapes  requires  a non- 
resistant  attitude  towards  the  chosen  [AaO]  approach.  In  mirroring  the  orientation  [O]  in  the 
intention  [A],  a rigorous  examination  of  their  roots  has  been  made  possible.  Conciliations  at 
Germanic  Symbel  relate  to  the  discovery  of  Retrial  as  the  basic  root  of  intention  and 
Participation  as  the  complementary  root  of  orientation.  By  coupling  Latin  graphemes  strings 
at  the  micro  level  with  the  componential  [A]  and  [O]  strands  at  the  macro  level,  it  has  become 
evident  that  the  essence  of  themes  and  motifs  must  be  produced  from  the  inside  out. 


From  an  etymological  point  of  view,  the  word  bier  is  of  West-Germanic  origin  and 
may  have  been  formed  with  the  Latin  word  bibere,  which  means  drinking.  All  other  related 
Germanic  constructions  take  their  departure  in  the  Middle  High  German  bier  or  its  Old 
German  version  bior.  As  Tacitus  points  out,  the  drinking  ritual  seems  to  play  an  important 
role  in  the  Germanic  societies.  Thus,  the  function  of  beer  as  a social  lubricate  can  be  studied 
with  Symbel  as  its  suitable  context.  Tacitus’  writing  on  the  custom  at  Symbel,  as  it  appears  in 
Chapter  22,  is  reproduced  as  follows. 

»Statim  e somno,  quem  plerumque  in  diem  extrahunt,  lavantur,  saepius  calida,  ut  apud  quos 
plurimum  hiems  occupat.  Lauti  cibum  capiunt:  separatae  singulis  sedes  et  sua  cuique  mensa. 

Turn  ad  negotia  nec  minus  saepe  ad  convivia  procedunt  armati.  Diem  noctemque  continuare 
potando  nulli  probrum.  Crebrae,  ut  inter  vinolentos,  rixae  raro  conviciis,  saepius  caede  et 
vulneribus  transiguntur.  Sed  et  de  reconciliandis  in  vicem  inimicis  et  iungendis  adfinitatibus  et 
adsciscendis  principibus,  de  pace  denique  ac  hello  plerumque  in  conviviis  consultant,  tamquam 
nullo  magis  tempore  aut  ad  simplices  cogitationes  pateat  animus  aut  ad  magnas  incalescat.  Gens 
non  astuta  nec  callida  aperit  adhuc  secreta  pectoris  licentia  ioci;  ergo  detecta  et  nuda  omnium 
mens.  Postera  die  retractatur,  et  salva  utriusque  temporis  ratio  est:  deliberant,  dum  fingere 
nesciunt,  constituunt,  dum  errare  non  possunt.  » Cornelii  Taciti  (98)  de  origine  et  situ 
Germanorum  (or  Germaniae)  liber,"  Chap.  22 

Evidence  of  the  essentially  Germanic  nature  of  this  kind  of  ritual  drinking  comes  from 
various  European  archaeological  sites  (Bauschatz,  1982;  Ward,  2001;  Wills,  2012)  In 
particular,  the  Icelanders  as  well  as  other  Scandinavian  tribes  and  the  Anglo-Saxon’s  of 
England  (Zuring,  2013)  have  practiced  the  drinking  ritual  at  Symbel  (Old  English)  or  Sumbl 
(Old  Norse).  Other  Germanic  tribes  have  also  practised  the  drinking  rituals  at  Symbel.  Rather 
than  trying  to  become  comprehensive,  focussing  on  the  Old  North  ritual  alone  will  be 
sufficient  in  order  to  trace  the  way  in  which  the  Germanic  tribes  relate  themselves  to  beer 
drinking.

Since  Tacitus  himself  is  the  text  producer  his  thoughts  can  be  discovered  and  made 
the  foundation  of  his  points  of  observation.  Furthermore,  his  viewpoints  are  conceived  to  be 
something  that  exists  only  through  a semantic-free  processing  of  the  observer-environment 
relationship  which  means  his  of  Germanic  Symbel  description.  Therefore  his  observations  on 
this  custom  will  be  examined  with  Perspective  Text  Analysis  (PTA).  Corresponding  manuals 
are  provided  in  the  Appendix.  By  means  of  the  given  instructions,  3D  geometric 
configurations  will  be  produced  which  are  free  from  semantic  interpretations. 

The  prominent  aspect  of  studying  text  as  bio-physical  expression  implies  that  this 
approach  represents  a qualitative  jump  into  a new  phase  in  studying  text.  The  present 
supposition  is  that  the  mechanisms  that  have  worked  in  historical  time  are  producing  the 
complex  configuration  of  the  actual  Latin  text.  Thus,  to  approach  Tacitus’  points  of 
observation  as  well  as  his  points  of  view  requires  the  bookkeeping  of  subtle  attitudinal 
changes  (in  the  mathematical  sense,  see  Hestenes,  1994,  p.  72)  and  to  recover  the  underlying 
rotational  changes  step-wise  and  without  intervening  dissociations  and  in  perfect  order 
(Baeyer,  1999,  12-14).  A further  supposition  concerns  the  expression  of  the  underlying  forces 
which  are  expected  to  generate  topology-changing  transitions  by  mirroring  the  Objective  in 
the  Agent.  Whenever  these  processes  require  the  integration  of  a variable  into  a composite, 
rotational  transformations  have  to  perform  the  transition  from  the  expression  of  individual 
strings  to  the  evolution  of  more  or  less  long-winded  strands.  By  writing  his  viewpoints  into 
text,  observing  and  measuring  can  be  patterned  as  shown  in  Table  A1  of  the  Appendix  and 
accounted  for  with  precision. 

Bio-kinetic  Energy  Investment 

An  important  result  of  the  [AaO]  formula  appears  in  the  establishment  of  the  helical 
properties  of  its  ring-configurations.  Thus,  the  crucial  import  of  local  string-grapheme 
interaction  can  be  demonstrated  only  through  a rotation-governed  processing  of  specific 
changes  in  angular  articulation.  Since  evolutionary  changes  appear  in  the  string-grapheme 
composites,  i.e.,  with  each  other  integrated  strings  of  graphemes,  this  kind  of  integration 
generates  layered  composites  as  the  units  of  textual  evolution.  Calculating  the  depth  of  a ring 
means  calculating  the  magnitude  of  (R=W=0),  i.e.,  (O)  minus  the  roots  C/28,  Vxfy)  of  the 
magnitudes  in  the  string-rotation  of  the  moving  (p(0))  and  (a(cj))  variables.  This  measure 
generates  the  ground  for  transformation  of  the  produced  sequences  and  composites.  In 
computing  the  [AaO]  ring- structure,  the  involved  rotations  are  carried  out  in  the  following 
way: 


The  winding  magnitude  of  a strand  is  taken  as  basis  (1/1).  Every  in-folding  of  a segment  of  this 
strand  is  treated  as  an  expression  of  the  variable’s  vibrating  property.  Since  it  is  an  expression 
of  the  strand’s  contextual  circumstances,  its  surface-oriented  developing  curling  plays  a 
complementary  role,  which  is  accounted  for  by  adding  the  fraction  of  (1/10)  as  curling  value  to 
the  basic  winding  value  of  the  strand.  Thereafter  the  contextual  fitness  value  is  added  as  a valve 
fraction  of  (1/100)  of  the  winding-value,  but  multiplied  with  the  number  of  in-folding 
graphemes . This  procedure  is  reiterated  for  every  segment  of  a strand.  If  the  strand  is  growing, 
this  lowers  its  short-distance  sensitivity  and  thus  is  increasing  its  in-folding  capacity. 

As  shown  in  Table  A1  of  the  Appendix,  this  measure  allows  for  the  numerical  representation 
of  rotational  distance.  It  follows  that  intention  and  orientation  is  mediated  through  an 
exchange  of  strand  properties  by  means  of  flow-fields.  Since  flow-fields  themselves  are  made 
up  of  vibrating  as  well  as  non- vibrating  strand  segments,  the  directional  turn  of  a winding 
strand  must  take  into  account  all  deviations  from  surface  uniformity.  In  conclusion,  the 
dynamics  in  a ring  structure  resides  not  in  the  physical  reality  of  a segment,  but  in  the 
metaphysical  fraction  or  share  it  has  in  the  bio-kinetic  energy  transformation  of  string- 


The  Beer  Drinking  Theme  in  Tacitus’  Germania  3 


grapheme  compounds  and  their  exchange  with  flow-fields.  In  addition,  textual  pattern 
movements  must  be  related  with  exactness  to  proper  biological  time  scales.  The  model 
followed  is  pictured  in  Figure  1. 


Growth 

(Irreversible  Time) 


Figure  1 Coupling  and  Entangling  of  States 

In  capturing  a change  in  the  state  of  a string  through  the  vibrating  (As)  properties  of  a 
grapheme,  localising  the  strings  on  opposite  dots,  according  to  their  properties,  shows  that 
time-dependent  shifts  are  specifying  the  associated  strings  reciprocally.  In  separating  the  dots 
in  the  first  plane  through  the  energy  (Vi)-function,  two  types  of  dots  can  be  identified:  A 
filled  dot,  which  indicates  a non-relaxed  state  and  a non-filled  dot,  which  implies  a relaxed 
state.  As  a consequence,  a string  must  revolve  around  the  energy  component  (v).  Twisting 
and  winding  strings  in  a composition  of  a sequence  are  constitutive  of  the  helical 
configuration  of  a composite.  The  expression  of  a string  (As)  relates  to  non-linear  and  time- 
dependent  change  in  energy  conservation,  meanwhile  winding  means  the  production  of  time- 
dependent  and  non-linear  string-grapheme  compounds  as  well  as  layered  composites  that  can 
be  used  in  an  operational  definition  of  the  concepts  of  speed  and  acceleration.  Since  flow- 
fields  must  show  definite  winding  (W>1)  directions  (Winfree,  1980,  pp.  14,  244),  it  can  be 
stated  that  also  flow-fields  have  helical  properties.  The  proof  of  the  hypothesis  is  independent 
of  parameter  fitting. 

In  a straightforward  application  of  these  concepts,  it  is  possible  to  derive  the 
dynamical  properties  of  a string-grapheme  compound  from  the  recombination  spectrum  (As). 
Accounting  for  the  spectrum  is  a function  of  string  movements.  Since  measured  accelerations 
are  related  to  timing,  i.e.,  channelling  through  the  (0a)  and  (0p)  dummies  of  the  involved 
flow-fields,  acceleration  is  identifiable  with  the  expression  of  the  gradient  dynamics  of  a 
flow-field,  which  is  characterised  by  repeated  co-valence  and  joint  causation.  Finally,  it  may 
be  noted  that  the  [AaO]  ring,  used  in  the  process,  must  be  treated  as  the  most  primitive 
synthesising  mechanism  (for  a thorough  discussion,  see  Hardison,  1999). 

The  following  Flow  Chart  is  based  on  the  text  processing,  shown  in  Table  A1  of  the 
Appendix.  Since  the  given  text  appears  to  have  attracted  many,  it  is  made  the  source  for  an 
attempt  to  reveal  the  kind  of  ideas  that  are  covered  by  the  textual  surface.  This  is  especially 
challenging  when  the  original  has  been  produced  in  historical  time.  Furthermore,  finding  a 
proper  solution  is  dependent  on  the  way  in  which  perceived  relations  have  been  processed 
and  coordinated  in  chaining  together  textual  elements.

The  coding  protocol  of  the  Flow  Chart  is  showing  that  the  governing  (a)  variable  is  repeated 
whenever  two  or  more  ([:!)  variables  appear  within  the  range  of  a particular  action  (=verb). 
The  protocol  makes  evident  that  both  components  are  performing  twofold  dependent 
functional  controls  over  angular  articulation  and  management  of  the  produced  movement 
patterns. 

Within  the  conceived  set  of  specifying  conditions,  repetition  implies  reusing  the 
active  agent.  Thus,  a special  character  of  the  coding  appears  through  the  repetition  of 
particular  (a)  variables  with  the  effect  of  an  unchanged  winding  (=rotation)  factor.  In 
contrast,  channelling  (...)  through  reiteration  specifies  the  degree  to  which  a particular 
variable  is  reversibly  addressed  during  the  course  and  thus  is  changing  the  winding  factor. 
For  example,  it  is  shown  how  (00)  is  changing  at  (0,2).  The  same  kind  of  reiteration  appears 
when  the  value  of  (as)  is  changing  at  the  position  of  (<X6),  while  (aw)  is  repeated  in  the 
positions  of  (a  1 5 J and  (ai6).  In  principle,  channelling  appears  when  a dummy  is  supplemented 
with  the  shadow  of  the  immediately  preceding  agent  variable  (0.1)  that  is  the  ROT  of  (ai). 
When  (an)  and  (an),  are  involving  (aio)  the  shadow  is  finally  fading  into  position  (an)  and 
thus  become  even  more  shadow-like.  Shadowing  at  (an)  may  also  mean  a combination  of 
repetition  and  channelling  which  is  competing  with  the  material  expressions  at  (aio). 

Since  the  observed  text  building  behaviour  is  coupled  with  the  emergence  of  steps,  a 
dynamic  coupling  of  steps  with  shape  is  simultaneously  inferred  as  foundation  for  the 
development  of  a Potential  Energy  Surface  (PES).  The  waves,  appearing  in  the  PES  graphs 
will  show  that  invested  energy  potentials  become  similar  to  waving  fabrics.  Hence  the  notion 
of  a dynamic  movement  texture  seems  to  be  a fitting  conceptualization  of  its  form  or  shape. 
The  most  obvious  capacity  of  a shape  concerns  the  reflection  of  fluidity. 

A study  of  the  intentional  flow  dynamics  allows  a comparison  between  positions 
where  the  asymmetries  become  particularly  pronounced.  Table  A2  of  the  Appendix  gives  a 
summary  and  shows  that  the  corresponding  places  of  textual  articulation  appear  in  the  first 
case  of  interval  1.  Here  the  rotation  value  is  near  the  maximum  and  can  be  mirrored  as  a 
strong  and  rapidly  inflating  wave  crest  in  Figure  2. 

Resonance  in  the  Beer  Drinking  Theme 

The  difference  between  expansion  and  extension  can  be  expressed  experimentally  in 
two  distinct  ways.  One  way  concerns  the  repetition  of  a grapheme  configuration,  which  leaves 
the  winding  factor  unchanged.  The  other  refers  to  the  degree  of  channelling,  which  specifies 
the  degree  to  which  a particular  configuration  is  reversibly  addressed  during  the  course  of 
writing  and  thus  is  changing  the  winding  factor.  Whenever  the  evolutionary  process  requires 
the  integration  of  grapheme  into  composites,  rotational  translations  perform  the  transition 
from  the  expression  of  strings  to  the  evolution  of  an  in-folded  strand. 

With  the  introduced  novelty  of  imaging  the  dynamics  in  a behavioural  approach  to 
text  building,  the  stepping  function  of  Figure  1 can  be  bound  to  the  manifestation  of 
differences  in  intention  and  orientation.  Additionally,  the  pointer  function  of  the  prepositions 
is  rendering  a certain  focus  on  the  direction  in  the  articulation.  With  the  produced  flow-fields 
as  intermediaries,  layered  composites  provide  the  ground  for  the  geometric  shapes  of  a text 
space  as  shown  by  the  graphs  of  Figure  2 and  3 below. 

Finally,  if  the  bonding  of  a-  and  [1-variables  in  an  expression  would  appear  to  be 
dependent  only  on  a linear  relationship,  its  reconstructed  text  space  would  appear  stationary. 
However,  the  strict  dependency  in  the  bonding  is  governing  a displacement  and  refraction 
mechanism  whose  work  is  preventing  the  production  of  stationary  results.

Figure  2 Fluidity  in  the  Agent  Component 

Since  it  has  been  possible  to  express  the  overall  dynamics  in  a sequence  of  strings  as  distance 
from  the  thermodynamic  equilibrium  it  can  also  be  shown  that  cyclic  phase  transitions  are 
determining  the  helical  properties  of  their  strands.  These  translations  proceed  over  the 
sequencing  space  of  the  locally  determined  string  production. 

Characteristic  of  the  speed  in  the  Agent  component  is  its  epigrammatic  terseness  and 
vividness.  Three  examples  are  specifying  verb-less  phrases  at  the  beginning  of  the 
corresponding  sentences.  A wave  crest,  accomplished  by  the  first  explicitly  expressed  agent 
variable,  is  made  up  of  specifications  before  the  verb  ( Statim  e somno,  quem  plerumque  in 
diem).  Its  magnitude  is  (-+8.20).  Since  materialised  strings  appear  at  the  textual  level  as 


The  Beer  Drinking  Theme  in  Tacitus’  Germania  7 


graphemes , they  mark  certain  character  properties.  This  means  that  the  magnitude,  related  to 
the  Latin  grapheme  composition,  provides  a certain  peak  in  the  resonance  spectrum.  After  the 
in-folding  has  been  performed  another  peak  appears  in  interval  four  with  case  1 which 
implies  the  maximum  rotation  value  («+10.13).  Hence,  the  agent  variable  ( Turn  ad  negotia 
nec  minus  saepe  ad  convivia ) is  very  prominent.  Finally,  the  shape  gets  further  undulating 
kick  in  interval  11  with  case  1 and  the  rotation  value  (w+5.97),  which  means  a boost  by  the 
string  sequence  (,  el  salva  utriusque  temporis  ratio).  Thereafter,  rotating  is  producing  more 
evenly  appearing  results.  Thus,  flows  as  intermediaries  generate  grapheme  composites  which 
provide  the  ground  for  the  establishment  of  asymmetries. 

Slower  flows  appear  towards  the  middle  and  reveal  a hole  ( 0 ) in  the  texture  through 
which  strings  are  fading.  A closer  look  reveals  that  case  3 in  interval  seven  and  before  the 
verb  form  (el  0 ascisendis)  constitutes  a lower  fold  that  is  visible  with  (~+ 1 .43).  Further,  in 
interval  7 is  the  flow  in  case  5 dependent  on  the  agent  dummy  (. 0 ).  Since  case  1 (Sed  el  de)  is 
repeated  by  sliding  over  two  borders,  the  root  has  been  extracted  twice  and  resulted  in  the 
rotation  value  («-1.71).  The  deepest  tip  appears  in  the  seventh  interval  in  case  eight  and  is  the 
result  of  further  fading  away  of  the  agent  and  thus  deeper  into  the  ongoing  conceptualization. 
Before  the  verb  form  ( 0 incalescat),  it  marks  a rotation  value  («-4.05).  Whenever  the 
translation  process  requires  the  integration  of  string  sequences  into  composites,  rotational 
changes  perform  the  transition  from  the  expression  of  strings  to  the  evolution  of  involutes. 

The  other  kind  of  produced  involutes  relates  to  the  angular  articulations  which  have 
produced  the  PES  graph  of  Figure  3.  This  graph  is  a function  of  the  textual  elements  that 
perform  at  the  right-hand  side  of  the  AaO-formula.  By  imaging  the  idea  of  fluidity,  inherent 
Symbel  (sum-alu)  beer-gathering  or  beer-sharing  (Bauschatz,  1982,  p.  135),  the  horn-fluidity 
relationship  becomes  distinct  through  the  moulded  horn  which  can  be  detected  in  Figure  3. 
Moreover  the  ‘Horn’  appears  as  attached  to  the  ‘Table’. 

In  the  discussion  of  Bauschatz  (1982,  p.  9),  it  becomes  clear  that  the  generic  term 
picked  for  this  drink  is  ol  (‘beer’). The  Horn-Table  union  and  the  powerful  alcoholic  drinking 
are  related  to  the  flow  which  puts  forward  the  icon  of  a drinking  horn  and  the  Table-Bench 
arrangement.  The  horn  may  be  seen  to  be  bound  to  the  bench,  which  appears  as  a plate  at  the 
right-hand  side.  Together  they  make  up  the  significance  of  the  Symbel,  namely  togetherness 
in  drinking  which,  moreover,  is  ritually  repeated.  This  feature  is  captured  by  the  depth  of  the 
generated  horn.  The  waves,  are  showing  that  the  invested  energy  potential  become  similar  to 
a waving  fabric.  Even  here,  the  notion  of  dynamic  movement  texture  seems  to  be  a fitting 
term  for  its  form  or  shape.  Clearly,  the  Latin  text  carries  the  notion  of  sitting  down  for  mutual 
positioning  with  a concrete  purpose  in  mind  and  within  a friendly  and  unconstraint  context. 

From  Table  1 it  becomes  clear  that  people  at  the  bench  are  forming  intimate  and 
essential  relationships.

Since  drinking  is  not  the  primary  activity  at  Symbel,  the  last  two  activities  of  Table  1 point 
towards  the  fact  that  intoxication  with  beer  has  no  negative  effect  on  consciousness  and 
hence,  does  not  interfere  with  togetherness,  speech  making  and  negotiated  settlements.

Tacitus  as  text  producer  gives  expression  to  his  mode  of  picking  up  information  on  the 
drinking  ritual  of  the  Germanic  people.  To  the  degree  that  a sensible  verbal  reaction  to  the 
fading  of  the  observed  facts  can  be  processed,  conceptual  coherence  can  be  penetrated 
without  direct  access  to  the  context.  Channelling  (...)  through  reiteration  specifies  the  degree 
to  which  a particular  variable  is  reversibly  addressed  during  the  course  and  thus  is  changing 
the  winding  factor.  Table  A3  of  the  Appendix  supphes  further  information  on  participating  in 


The  Beer  Drinking  Theme  in  Tacitus’  Germania  9 


a Symbel  event  at  which  serious  business  as  well  as  war  and  peace  may  be  discussed. 
Drinking  and  speaking  are  pointing  to  joint  activities  which  are  integrated  by  the 
componential  the  channelling  procedures. 

The  Orientation  Space 

The  coordinates,  made  up  by  the  strain-  and  shear-dimensions  refer  to  the  underlying 
mesh  system  of  the  dependency  graph,  shown  in  Figure  4. 

Orientation 


Figure  4 Fusion  Dynamics  in  the  Objective  Component 

In  contrast  to  the  X-axis  of  the  fluidity  spaces,  the  X-axis  of  the  fusion  spaces  is  responding 
to  the  Strain,  while  the  Y-axis,  instead  of  carrying  the  intervals,  is  now  specifying  Shear. 
Furthermore,  the  Z-axis  is,  instead  of  carrying  the  flow  dynamics,  related  to  the  fusion 


10  Bernhard  Bierschenk 


dynamics.  The  theoretical  significance  of  applying  invariant  mesh  systems  to  the  fusion  of 
dynamic  measurements  relates  to  the  way  in  which  the  concentration  of  information  within  a 
space  has  its  impact  on  the  evolving  fusion  dynamics. 

Since  the  dynamics  in  the  folding  is  manifested  in  continuous  and  discontinuous 
trajectories  at  the  macro-level,  both  have  constraining  effects.  Based  on  the  landscape 
established  in  Figure  4,  it  becomes  possible  to  capture  the  point  of  destination  through  the 
final  state  attractor  whose  coupling  configuration  consists  of  the  following  dependency 
relation: 

T31  Challenge  (strain-9,  shear-4),  magnitude  of  (-+84.77) 

T4  Reasonableness  (strain-2,  shear-3),  magnitude  of  (--113.31) 

T41  Participation  (strain-3,  shear-3),  magnitude  of  (--28.54) 

When  linked  to  the  distance  in  the  folded  space,  the  fusion  dynamics  gives  expression  to  a 
very  characteristic  landscape  of  mountains  and  valleys.  The  coupling  configuration  implies  a 
transformation  where  (T4)  is  acting  on  (T3i).  Once  the  trajectories  of  the  participating  micro 
structures  have  moved  the  fusion  process  into  the  realm  of  the  global  state  attractor  (T44),  the 
transforming  attractor  (T4)  as  well  as  the  final  attractor  (T4i)  is  shown  to  lie  below  sea  level. 

It  is  no  accident  that  the  root  of  the  orientation  dimension  has  manifested  itself  in 
Participation  since  at  Symbel,  it  is  foremost  the  social  event  that  is  of  interest.  It  consists  of  a 
number  of  people  which  are  gathering  around  the  bench  and  bound  together  by  their  words. 
Thus  the  Symbel  cannot  be  a one-man  show,  i.e.,  held  in  isolation  or  in  silence.  Words  are 
spoken  over  the  horn  before  the  drinking  (Wills,  2012,  p.  3). 

The  pattern  in  the  linkage  between  the  participants  is  further  extended  to  great  actions, 
previously  established  through  speech  making.  Hence  a deed  reworded  at  Symbel  becomes  a 
reality  account.  The  participant  who  serves  this  function  of  creating  a saga  appears  in  the  role 
of  the  spokesman  and  consequently  as  a challenger  of  the  scope  of  the  presented  actions. 

...  in  such  activity,  the  power  of  all  other  actions  is  brought  to  bear  upon  the 
ritual  moment  and  fixes  it  within  the  ever-evolving  interrelation  of  all  present 
actions  with  the  past  (Bauschatz,  1982,  p.  136). 

It  is  clear  from  the  index  of  the  attractor  that  Challenge  (T31)  has  become  materialized  in  a 
microstructure  that  follows  with  a certain  distance  the  impact  of  Reasonableness  (T4).  The 
boasts  made  by  the  challenger  or  guest  on  behalf*  of  the  host  thus  saving  the  host  the 
embarrassment  of  entering  into  or  losing  an  argument  is  to  take  on  the  task  of  contesting 
(^author’s  change  of  behave  into  behalf).  Wills  (2012,  p.  8)  underlines  his  statement  with  the 
observation  that  a person  taking  on  the  role  of  a challenger  should  be  thick  skinned  and 
knowledgeable  of  lore  and  the  group ’s  history  and  politics. 

The  participants,  sitting  orderly  at  the  bench  are  celebrating  Consensus  which  implies 
the  attractor  (T3g).  The  Symbel  as  context  of  a social  event  is  fostering  togetherness.  This 
attraction  is  deep  seated  and  appears  below  sea  level  at  (strain-2,  shear-5)  with  a magnitude 
of  (--79.48).  The  con-sense  of  spring  water  with  powerful  waters  appears  through  its 
relationship  to  the  event  (Bauschatz,  1982,  p.  134).  Hence,  the  power  of  fluidity  is  felt  in 
depth. 

In  the  analysis,  the  attractor  T36  carries  Conscience  (strain-2,  shear-6)  with  a 
magnitude  of  (~-5.56)  and  has  emerged  on  the  left-hand  side  of  the  deep  valley  and  thus  is 
partaking  in  the  evolution  of  Consensus  (T3g).  Therefore,  in  order  to  generate  a communal 
mood,  the  participants  may  enter  altered  states  of  togetherness  through  chants  and  songs.  In 
fact,  the  narrative  of  Tacitus  provides  a way  of  accessing  Symbel  not  merely  as  myth  but  as 


The  Beer  Drinking  Theme  in  Tacitus’  Germania  1 1 


reality,  lived  on  the  basis  of  the  underlying  operations  that  are  binding  together  the 
participants  with  present  and  past. 

Conscience  at  (T36)  implies  that  the  Germanic  Symbel  (Feast)  seems  to  have  survived 
as  an  expression  for  the  power  of  the  past  (story  telling)  on  the  present.  In  this  role  it  is  the 
result  of  an  attempt  to  comprehend  the  core  of  Germanic  culture.  On  the  other  hand  the 
landscape  has  also  a marked  plane  surface  attached  to  a sharply  rising  mountain.  Integrated  in 
the  solid  mountain  massif  is  growing  acuity  which  is  reflected  through  the  following  state 
attractions: 

T17  Doubt  (strain-21,  shear- 1),  magnitude  of  (-+82.63) 

T3  Credibility  (strain-9,  shear-5),  magnitude  of  (~+2. 1 4) 

T31  Challenge  (strain-9,  shear-4),  magnitude  of  (-+84.77) 

Again,  appearing  late  on  the  transformation  path,  the  attractor  (T17)  carries  a magnitude  of 
(-+82.63)  and  is  extremely  challenging.  By  asking  for  facts,  shifts  in  awareness  are  setting 
the  stage  at  Symbel.  By  questioning  facts,  the  transforming  impact  of  (T3),  however  slight,  is 
underpinning  a need  for  assurance  about  the  real  happening  of  an  event.  In  this  sense,  the 
spoken  words  become  the  locus  of  reality  and  reality  within  history.  For  the  development  at 
the  Symbel,  questioning  the  Credibility  (T3)  appears  with  a magnitude  of  (-+2.14).  As  the 
result  of  previous  states  of  grace,  the  attractor  is  a natural  part  in  the  practice  of  conscience. 
The  carrying  state  attractor  may  point  towards  some  indications  to  criticism. 

Thus  the  named  state  relation  appears  to  work  against  simplistic  conceptions  of  what 
may  be  implied  by  the  robustness  in  an  inquiry.  The  mutual  dependency  between  the  last 
three  termini  has  become  specified  through  their  new  neighbourhood  relations.  Through  the 
causal  relationship  between  termini  and  the  underlying  structure,  individual  specificity  makes 
evident  that  Tacitus  is  contributing  with  uniqueness  in  the  reported  observations  and  in  his 
way  of  grasping  the  centrality  of  the  Symbel  as  a specifically  Germanic  phenomenon. 

Table  A3  in  the  Appendix  gives  a complete  account  of  the  folding  into  mono-layered 
and  multi-layered  composites.  The  derived  names  have  empirical  value,  because  the 
derivation  regards  a configuration  of  composites  as  relations,  which  are  mutually  dependent. 
Furthermore,  as  illustrated  with  the  discussion  of  Figure  4,  a new  kind  of  conservation  is 
generating  meaning.  Differences  in  meaning  are  producing  concentrations  that  are 
influencing  the  development  of  folds.  Resulting  from  differences  in  the  dynamics,  certain 
energy  concentrations  are  influencing  the  folding  in  a particular  region.  However,  to  catch  the 
fundamental  implications  of  the  resulting  information  synthesis  requires  that  the  underlying 
order  variables  are  producing  conceptually  valid  spaces. 

The  Intention  Space 

From  the  intention  point  of  view,  the  Agent  component  in  the  following  graph 
representation  is  specifying  the  profile  of  the  intention  dimension.  Searching  for  novel 
concepts  concerning  the  import  of  intention  for  the  observation  of  the  Symbel  tradition 
requires  a unique  way  of  varying  and  integrating  the  values  of  the  Agent  component.  Table 
A4  in  the  Appendix  builds  on  the  cooperative  interaction  of  the  mesh  systems  of  the  Agent 
and  Objective  Component  respectively  which  provide  the  complete  results  of  the  fusion 
process.  In  order  to  fit  the  particular  configuration  of  attractors  the  same  number  of  folding 
lines  has  been  selected  for  the  labelling  of  the  path.  The  invariants  of  intention  have  been 
extracted  according  to  Table  A5.  Once  more,  the  highest  mountain  represents  the  slowest 
path.  Hence,  more  climbing  is  required  and  involves  a higher  barrier  for  the  consumption  of 
free  energy.  The  lower  mountain  massif  at  the  right-hand  side  implies  faster  folding  and 
consequently  lower  barriers.

Figure  5 Fusion  Dynamics  in  the  Agent  Component 

The  final  or  global  state  attractor  (T4i)  at  (strain-2,  shear-4)  carries  a magnitude  of  (~+88.7) 
and  is  a source  for  Retrial  or  restoring  grace  and  can  be  related  to  the  presence  of  criteria  for 
judging  if  and  to  what  degree  one’s  conduct  or  deal  was  satisfactory  for  all  involved  parties. 
Hence,  Retrial  means  that  doubts  may  have  occurred  and  may  have  required  that  possible 
faults  become  unmasked  in  the  arrangement.  When  measured  against  the  energy  invested  in 
the  established  state  attractor  (T4),  position  (strain-3,  shear-5)  and  a magnitude  of  (-+78.75), 
its  descriptor  Equilibrium  signals  a lot  of  courage  in  order  to  dismantle  false  impressions  or 
the  disturbing  behaviour  of  a fellow  at  the  Colloquium  which  appears  in  the  position  (strain- 


The  Beer  Drinking  Theme  in  Tacitus’  Germania  13 


5,  shear-5).  The  discovered  magnitude  of  (-+68.62)  indicates  that  a concentrated  effort  needs 
to  be  made  in  order  to  meet  proper  priorities. 

The  neighbouring  attractor  (T27)  in  the  position  (strain- 15,  shear-6)  carries  the 
descriptive  notion  Unconstraint  which  may  imply  a warm  and  hospitable  atmosphere  at  the 
Symbel.  The  magnitude  (-+68.33)  of  the  attractor  at  this  node  is  a sizable  concentration  of 
energy.  Further,  the  amount  marks  the  importance  of  keeping  good  relationship  for  each 
other.  This,  however,  requires  an  open  attitude,  to  admit  mistakes  and  to  correct  them. 

The  state  attractor  (T31)  in  the  position  (strain-3,  shear-5)  and  a magnitude  of  (=+72.4) 
signals  a pronounced  key.  Putting  stress  on  Non-false  means  putting  stress  on  the  dominance 
of  fair  behaviour.  Reasonable  behaviour  is  expected  to  contribute  to  the  fact  that  wrong-doing 
is  prohibited  and  hence  socially  unacceptable.  Innocent  or  serious  hiding  obscure  ideas 
behind  socially  accepted  blinds  is  not  legitimate  nor  a justifiable  case. 

The  intention  to  provoke  unlawful  behaviour  or  urging  someone  to  behave  unlawfully 
is  the  source  of  Incitement,  i.e.,  the  state  attractor  (T29)  in  the  position  (strain- 13,  shear-6) 
which  carries  the  magnitude  of  (=+69.6).  It  may  be  conceived  of  as  a significant  impact 
regarding  the  questioning  of  the  decency  of  a performed  speech.  In  sum,  the  attractor  seems 
to  have  emerged  on  the  possibility  of  fabricated  facts  or  illusive  views. 

Finally,  the  state  attractor  (T2i)  in  the  position  (strain-21,  shear-2)  carries  a magnitude 
of  (=+62.1)  and  concerns  the  Custom  of  the  Germanic  people.  Hence,  noticing  Symbel  as  a 
traditional  and  widely  accepted  way  of  socializing  at  occasions  where  noble  man  make 
business  contracts,  marriage  or  war  and  peace.  On  the  agenda  is  of  course  an  observation  that 
has  been  confirmed  by  many  contemporary  persons  and  in  later  times  by  outsiders.  In 
particular,  the  custom  of  drinking  from  the  horn  in  this  kind  of  ceremonial  cases  requires 
faithfulness  and  may  have  involved  the  swearing  of  oaths  in  the  presence  of  the  assembled. 


Discussion 

Archaeological  knowledge  of  the  Symbel  comes  foremost  from  Scandinavian,  English 
and  German  sources  (Ward,  2001,  p.  1;  Wills,  2012,  p.  1).  The  primary  information 
associated  with  the  horn  as  drinking  vessel  implies  that  the  performed  rituals  link  to  activities 
that  foster  the  togetherness  of  noble  men.  Another  source,  based  on  literature  studies,  has 
been  provided  by  Zuring  (2013)  who  has  collected  a number  of  literary  documents  which 
give  accounts  on  the  Germanic  drinking  ritual,  however  mainly  in  the  Anglo-Saxon  (English) 
context  of  the  middle  ages.  The  paper  provides  two  perspectives:  One  is  addressing  the 
Christian  view,  exemplified  by  Beowulf.  The  other  opposing  view  connects  to  the  inherent 
Germanic  aspect  of  fellowship  and  loyalty.  However,  concerning  this  age-old  vernacular 
trend  (Martinez,  2010)  in  the  kind  of  text  analysis,  performed  by  Zuring,  there  is  no  easy  way 
to  get  rid  of  all  semantic  confusions  that  might  be  associated  with  conclusions  drawn  from 
the  study  of  historical  works. 

For  overcoming  the  impediment  of  interpretation,  the  PTA  strategy  has  been  applied 
which  allows  for  the  bio-physical  study  of  the  intentional  properties.  Treating  an  ancient  text 
experimentally,  like  Tacitus’  narration  of  the  events  at  Symbel,  means  considering  text  as 
self-referential  and  self-organising  system  which  becomes  structured  through  its  own  internal 
driving  forces.  Hence,  the  main  conclusion  to  be  drawn  from  the  provided  analyses  is  that  the 
Germanic  people  have  focussed  on  bonding  among  the  participants  in  which  equilibration 
and  mutual  obligations  were  recognised.  Thus,  the  Symbel  is  the  natural  context  where  guests 
can  behave  unconstraint  and  appeased  among  associates. 

The  configuration  of  the  termini,  presented  in  the  Figures  4 and  5,  appears  to  preserve 
the  long-standing  Germanic  tradition  for  organizing  form  and  management  of  social 


14  Bernhard  Bierschenk 


meetings.  Beer  is  the  main  vehicle  for  conveying  cultural  values  as  well  as  behavioural  norms 
and  expectations.  The  discussion  captures  the  essence  of  the  roots  of  a social  relationship 
which  suspends  on  equality  and  participation  as  well  as  on  strong  emphasis  of 
reasonableness,  even  though  Tacitus  has  been  critical  of  the  convention  of  mixing  beer 
drinking  with  business  making.
