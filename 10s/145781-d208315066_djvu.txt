CORRECTION  OF  OIL,  GAS  AND  MINERAL  LEASE 

Reference  is  hereby  made  to  that  certain  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease  ("Subject 
Lease")  by  and  between  the  undersigned  Lessor(s)  and  Dale  Property  Services,  L.L.C.,  a 
Texas  limited  liability  company,  as  Lessee,  recorded  in  the  Real  Property  Records  of 
Tarrant  County,  Texas  on  February  20,  2007,  Document  No.  D207061035.  Subject 
Lease  was  subsequently  assigned  to  Chesapeake  Exploration,  L.L.C.,  successor  by 
merger  to  Chesapeake  Exploration  Limited  Partnership,  thereby  authorizing  Chesapeake 
to  investigate,  explore,  prospect,  drill,  and  produce  oil  and  gas  (reserving  to  said  Lessor 
the  usual  royalties),  upon  the  lands  described  herein,  situated  in  Tarrant  County,  Texas. 

WHEREAS,  by  that  certain  Conveyance  recorded  as  Document  No.  D207131205 
of  the  Official  Public  Records  of  Tarrant  County,  Texas,  said  Lease  is  now  owned  and 
held  in  entirety  by  the  undersigned  Lessee;  and 

WHEREAS,  the  legal  description  on  the  Subject  Lease  mistakenly  refers  to  a  Plat 
Map  "Volume  204,  Page  9"  for  the  East  25  feet  of  the  North  44  feet  of  Lot  5  and  the 
North  44  feet  of  Lot  6,  Block  110,  of  the  Belmont  Terrace  Addition,  when  it  should  read 
"Volume  106,  Page  91"  instead;  and 

WHEREAS,  Lessor  and  Lessee  desire  to  execute  this  instrument  in  order  to 
correct  the  aforementioned  mistake; 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  for  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and 
sufficiency  of  which  are  hereby  acknowledged,  Lessor  and  Lessee  do  hereby  correct  and 
amend  the  Subject  Lease  by  correcting  the  legal  description  thereon  as  follows; 

0.076  acres  of  land,  more  or  less,  being  the  East  25  feet  of  the  North  44  feet  of  Lot  5 
and  the  North  44  feet  of  Lot  6,  Block  110,  of  the  Belmont  Terrace  Addition,  an 
addition  to  the  City  of  Fort  Worth,  Texas,  more  particularly  described  by  metes  and 
bounds  in  that  certain  Plat  Map  recorded  in  Volume  106,  Page  91,  of  the  Plat 
Records  of  Tarrant  County,  Texas. 

To  facilitate  execution,  this  instrument  may  be  executed  in  as  many  counterparts 
as  may  be  convenient  or  required.  It  shall  not  be  necessary  that  the  signature  of  all 
persons  required  to  bind  any  party  appear  on  each  counterpart.  All  counterparts  shall 
collectively  constitute  a  single  instrument.  It  shall  not  be  necessary  in  making  proof  of 
this  instrument  to  produce  or  account  for  more  than  a  single  counterpart  containing  the 
respective  signatures  of,  or  on  behalf  of,  each  of  the  parties  hereto.  Any  signature  page  to 


1 


any  counterpart  may  be  detached  from  such  counterpart  without  impairing  the  legal  effect 
of  the  signatures  thereon  and  thereafter  attached  to  another  counterpart  identical  thereto 
except  having  attached  to  it  additional  signature  pages. 

IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  this  instrument  is  dated  and  made  effective  as  of  the 
date  of  the  Subject  Lease  as  set  forth  above. 

EXECUTED  effective  the  Z.^>  day  of    Do\y  ,  2008.
