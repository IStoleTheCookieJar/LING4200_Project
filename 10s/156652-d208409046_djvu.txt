THIS  LEASE  AGREEMENT  (this  "Lease")  is  made  as  of  the  3"1  day  of  September,  2008,  between  Cella  M.  Antrey, 
a  single  person,  whose  address  is  5305  Ira  Street,  Haltom  City,  Texas  76117,  as  Lessor,  and  XTO  Energy  Inc.,  whose 
address  is  810  Houston  Street,  Fort  Worth,  Texas  76102,  as  Lessee. 

1.  Leased  Premises.  In  consideration  of  a  cash  bonus  paid  upon  execution  of  this  Lease,  and  the  covenants  herein 
contained,  Lessor  hereby  grants,  leases  and  lets  exclusively  to  Lessee  the  land  described  on  Exhibit  "A"  attached  hereto 
(the  "leased  premises")  in  Tarrant  County,  Texas  (including  any  interests  therein  which  Lessor  may  hereafter  acquire  by 
reversion,  prescription  or  otherwise),  for  the  purpose  of  exploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  marketing  oil  and  gas. 
For  purposes  of  this  Lease,  "oil  and  gas"  means  oil,  gas  and  other  liquid  and  gaseous  hydrocarbons  and  their  constituent 
elements  produced  through  a  well  bore.  "Oil"  includes  all  condensate,  distillate  and  other  liquid  and  gaseous 
hydrocarbons  produced  through  a  well  bore.  "Gas"  includes  helium,  carbon  dioxide  and  other  commercial  gases,  as  well 
as  hydrocarbon  gases.  Expressly  excluded  from  this  Lease  are  lignite,  coal,  sulfur  and  other  like  minerals.  The  leased 
premises  shall  include  all  strips  and  gores,  streets,  easements,  highways  and  alleyways  adjacent  thereto.  Lessor  agrees  to 
execute  at  Lessee's  request  any  additional  or  supplemental  instruments  reasonably  necessary  for  a  more  complete  or 
accurate  description  of  the  leased  premises.  In  the  event  Lessor  owns  any  additional  acreage  than  that  for  which  bonus 
was  originally  paid,  Lessee  shall  pay  additional  bonus  at  the  rate  per  acre  on  which  bonus  was  originally  paid  when  this 
Lease  was  acquired.  For  the  purpose  of  determining  the  amount  of  any  shut-in  royalties  hereunder,  the  number  of  gross 
acres  specified  on  Exhibit  "A"  shall  be  deemed  correct,  whether  actually  more  or  less. 

2.  Term.  This  Lease  is  a  "paid  up"  lease  requiring  no  rentals.  Subject  to  the  other  provisions  contained  herein, 
this  Lease  shall  be  for  a  term  of  Three  (3_)  years  from  the  date  hereof  (the  "primary  term"),  and  for  as  long  thereafter  as 
oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered  hereby  are  produced  in  paying  quantities  from  the  leased  premises  or  from  lands 
pooled  therewith,  or  this  Lease  is  otherwise  maintained  in  effect  pursuant  to  the  provisions  hereof. 

3.  Royalty.  Royalties  on  oil,  gas  and  other  substances  produced  and  saved  hereunder  shall  be  paid  by  Lessee  to 
Lessor  as  follows:  (a)  for  oil  and  other  liquid  hydrocarbons  separated  at  Lessee's  separator  facilities,  the  royalty  shall  be 
twenty  five  percent  (25%)  of  such  production,  to  be  delivered  at  Lessee's  option  to  Lessor  at  the  wellhead  or  to  Lessor's 
credit  at  the  oil  purchaser's  transportation  facilities,  provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  continuing  right  to  purchase  such 
production  at  the  wellhead  market  price  then  prevailing  in  the  same  field  (or  if  there  is  no  such  price  then  prevailing  in  the 
same  field,  then  in  the  nearest  field  in  which  there  is  such  a  prevailing  price)  for  production  of  similar  grade  and  gravity; 
and  (b)  for  gas  (including  casinghead  gas)  and  all  other  substances  covered  hereby,  the  royalty  shall  be  twenty  five 
percent  (25%)  of  the  proceeds  realized  by  Lessee  from  the  sale  thereof,  computed  at  the  point  of  sale,  less  a  proportionate 
part  of  ad  valorem  taxes  and  production,  severance  or  other  excise  taxes,  and  less  the  permitted  unaffiliated  third  party 
deductions  described  below;  provided  that  Lessee  shall  have  the  continuing  right  to  purchase  such  production  at  the 
prevailing  wellhead  market  price  paid  for  production  of  similar  quality  in  the  same  field  (or  if  there  is  no  such  price  then 
prevailing  in  the  same  field,  then  in  the  nearest  field  in  which  there  is  such  a  prevailing  price)  pursuant  to  comparable 
purchase  contracts  entered  into  on  the  same  or  nearest  preceding  date  as  the  date  on  which  Lessee  commences  its 
purchases  hereunder.  If  at  the  end  of  the  primary  term  or  any  time  thereafter  one  or  more  wells  on  the  leased  premises  or 
lands  pooled  therewith  are  capable  of  producing  oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered  hereby  in  paying  quantities,  but 
such  well  or  wells  are  either  shut-in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  such  well  or  wells  shall 
nevertheless  be  deemed  to  be  producing  in  paying  quantities  for  the  purpose  of  maintaining  this  Lease.  A  well  that  has 
been  drilled  but  not  fraced  shall  be  deemed  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities.  If  for  a  period  of  ninety  (90) 
consecutive  days  such  well  or  wells  are  shut-in  or  production  therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee,  then  Lessee  shall  pay 
shut-in  royalty  of  fifty  dollars  ($50.00)  per  acre  then  covered  by  this  Lease  on  or  before  the  end  of  said  90-day  period  and 
thereafter  on  or  before  each  anniversary  of  the  end  of  said  90-day  period  while  the  well  or  wells  are  shut-in  or  production 
therefrom  is  not  being  sold  by  Lessee;  provided,  however,  that  if  this  Lease  is  otherwise  being  maintained  by  operations, 
or  if  production  is  being  sold  by  Lessee  from  another  well  or  wells  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  no 
shut-in  royalty  shall  be  due  until  the  end  of  the  90-day  period  next  following  cessation  of  such  operations  or  production. 
Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  it  is  expressly  understood  and  agreed  that  after  the  expiration  of  the 
primary  term,  Lessee  shall  not  have  the  right  to  continue  this  Lease  in  force  by  payment  of  shut-in  royalty  for  more  than  a 
single  period  of  up  to  two  (2)  consecutive  years. 

Royalties  on  oil,  gas  and  other  substances  produced  and  saved  hereunder  which  are  processed  in  a  processing 
plant  in  which  Lessee,  or  an  affiliate  of  Lessee,  has  a  direct  or  indirect  interest,  shall  be  calculated  based  upon  the  higher 
of  the  proceeds  received  or  the  market  value  of  the  products  so  processed.  Similarly,  on  oil,  gas  and  other  substances 
produced  and  saved  hereunder  which  are  sold  to  Lessee,  or  an  affiliate  of  Lessee,  royalties  shall  be  paid  based  upon  the 
higher  of  the  market  value  of  the  products  so  sold  and  the  proceeds  received  by  Lessee  for  said  products.  Notwithstanding 
anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  except  for  nonaffiliated  third-party  charges  incurred  or  paid  by  Lessee,  in  no  event  shall 
any  of  Lessor's  royalty  bear  any  part  of  the  costs  of  production  or  any  post-production  costs,  including  costs  of  lifting, 
gathering,  dehydration,  compression,  separation,  delivery,  transportation,  manufacture,  processing,  treating  or  marketing, 
or  for  construction,  operation  or  depreciation  of  any  plant  or  other  facility  or  equipment  for  processing  or  treating  oil  or 
gas  produced  from  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith.  In  no  event  shall  Lessor  receive  a  price  greater  than  or 
less  than  Lessee  in  sales  to  nonaffiliates. 

As  used  herein,  "affiliate"  means  (i)  a  corporation,  joint  venture,  partnership  or  other  entity  that  owns  more  than 
ten  percent  (10%)  of  the  outstanding  voting  interest  of  Lessee  or  in  which  Lessee  owns  more  than  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the 


NO  SURFACE  USE 
PAID  UP  OIL  AND  GAS  LEASE 


outstanding  voting  interest;  or  (ii)  a  corporation,  joint  venture,  partnership  or  other  entity  in  which,  together  with  Lessee, 
more  than  ten  percent  (10%)  of  the  outstanding  voting  interest  of  both  the  Lessee  and  the  other  corporation,  joint  venture, 
partnership  or  other  entity  is  owned  or  controlled  by  the  same  person  or  group  of  persons. 

4.  Payments.  All  shut-in  or  other  royalty  payments  under  this  Lease  shall  be  paid  or  tendered  to  Lessor  at  the 
above  address,  or  at  such  address  or  to  Lessor's  credit  at  such  depository  institution  as  Lessor  may  provide  written  notice 
of  from  time  to  time.  All  payments  or  tenders  may  be  made  in  currency,  by  check  or  by  draft. 

5.  Continuous  Drilling  Obligations.  If  Lessee  drills  a  well  which  is  incapable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities  (a 
"dry  hole")  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  or  if  all  production  (whether  or  not  in  paying  quantities) 
permanently  ceases  from  any  cause,  including  a  revision  of  unit  boundaries  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Section  6  or  the 
action  of  any  governmental  authority,  then  in  the  event  this  Lease  is  not  otherwise  being  maintained  in  force  it  shall 
nevertheless  remain  in  force  if  Lessee  commences  operations  for  reworking  an  existing  well  or  for  drilling  an  additional 
well  or  for  otherwise  obtaining  or  restoring  production  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  within  one 
hundred  eighty  (180)  days  after  completion  of  operations  on  such  dry  hole  or  within  one  hundred  and  eighty  (180)  days 
after  such  cessation  of  all  production.  If  at  the  end  of  the  primary  term,  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  this  Lease  is  not 
otherwise  being  maintained  in  force  but  Lessee  is  then  engaged  in  drilling,  reworking  or  any  other  operations  reasonably 
calculated  to  obtain  or  restore  production  therefrom,  this  Lease  shall  remain  in  force  so  long  as  any  one  or  more  of  such 
operations  are  prosecuted  with  no  cessation  of  more  than  ninety  (90)  consecutive  days,  and  if  any  such  operations  result  in 
the  production  of  oil  or  gas  or  other  substances  covered  hereby,  as  long  thereafter  as  there  is  production  in  paying 
quantities  from  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith.  After  completion  of  a  well  capable  of  producing  in  paying 
quantities  hereunder,  Lessee  shall  drill  such  additional  wells  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith  as  a 
reasonably  prudent  operator  would  drill  under  the  same  or  similar  circumstances  (a)  to  develop  the  leased  premises  as  to 
formations  then  capable  of  producing  in  paying  quantities  on  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith,  or  (b)  to 
protect  the  leased  premises  from  uncompensated  drainage  by  any  well  or  wells  located  on  other  lands  not  pooled 
therewith.  There  shall  be  no  covenant  to  drill  exploratory  wells  or  any  additional  wells  except  as  expressly  provided 
herein. 

6.  Pooling.  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  but  not  the  obligation  to  pool  all  or  any  part  of  the  leased  premises  or 
interests  therein  with  any  other  lands  or  interests,  as  to  any  or  all  depths  or  zones,  and  as  to  any  or  all  substances  covered 
by  this  lease,  either  before  or  after  the  commencement  of  production,  whenever  Lessee  deems  it  necessary  or  proper  to  do 
so  in  order  to  prudently  develop  or  operate  the  leased  premises,  whether  or  not  similar  pooling  authority  exists  with 
respect  to  such  other  lands  or  interests;  provided,  however,  that  the  entire  leased  premises  covered  by  this  Lease  shall  be 
included  in  any  unit  created  pursuant  to  the  pooling  authority  granted  herein.  The  unit  formed  by  such  pooling  for  an  oil 
well  which  is  not  a  horizontal  completion  shall  not  exceed  eighty  (80)  acres  plus  a  maximum  acreage  tolerance  of  ten 
percent  (10%),  and  for  a  gas  well  or  a  horizontal  completion  shall  not  exceed  six  hundred  forty  (640)  acres  plus  a 
maximum  acreage  tolerance  often  percent  (10%);  provided  that  a  larger  unit  may  be  formed  for  an  oil  well  or  gas  well  or 
horizontal  completion  to  conform  to  any  well  spacing  or  density  pattern  that  may  be  prescribed  or  permitted  by  any 
governmental  authority  having  jurisdiction  to  do  so.  For  the  purpose  of  the  foregoing,  the  terms  "oil  weir  and  "gas  well" 
shall  have  the  meanings  prescribed  by  applicable  law  or  the  appropriate  governmental  authority,  or,  if  no  definition  is  so 
prescribed,  "oil  well"  means  a  well  with  an  initial  gas-oil  ratio  of  less  than  100,000  cubic  feet  per  barrel  and  "gas  well" 
means  a  well  with  an  initial  gas-oil  ratio  of  100,000  cubic  feet  or  more  per  barrel,  based  on  24-hour  production  test 
conducted  under  normal  producing  conditions  using  standard  lease  separator  facilities  or  equivalent  testing  equipment; 
and  "horizontal  completion"  means  a  well  in  which  the  horizontal  component  of  the  gross  completion  interval  in  the 
reservoir  exceeds  the  vertical  component  thereof.  In  exercising  its  pooling  rights  hereunder,  within  ninety  (90)  days  of 
first  production,  Lessee  shall  file  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  unit  and  stating  the  effective  date  of 
pooling  which  may  be  retroactive  to  first  production.  In  the  event  Lessor's  acreage  is  included  in  a  well,  all  of  Lessor's 
acreage  shall  be  included.  Production,  drilling  or  reworking  operations  anywhere  on  a  unit  which  includes  the  leased 
premises  shall  be  treated  as  if  it  were  production,  drilling  or  reworking  operations  on  the  leased  premises,  except  that  the 
production  on  which  Lessor's  royalty  is  calculated  shall  be  that  proportion  of  the  total  unit  production  which  the  net 
acreage  covered  by  this  Lease  and  included  in  the  unit  bears  to  the  total  gross  acreage  in  the  unit.  Pooling  in  one  or  more 
instances  shall  not  exhaust  Lessee's  pooling  rights  hereunder,  and  Lessee  shall  have  the  recurring  right  but  not  the 
obligation  to  revise  any  unit  formed  hereunder  by  expansion  or  contraction  or  both,  either  before  or  after  commencement 
of  production,  in  order  to  conform  to  the  well  spacing  or  density  pattern  prescribed  or  permitted  by  the  governmental 
authority  having  jurisdiction,  or  to  conform  to  any  productive  acreage  determination  made  by  such  governmental 
authority.  In  making  such  a  revision,  Lessee  shall  file  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  revised  unit  and 
stating  the  effective  date  of  revision.  If  the  leased  premises  are  included  in  or  excluded  from  the  unit  by  virtue  of  such 
revision,  the  proportion  of  unit  production  on  which  royalties  are  payable  hereunder  shall  thereafter  be  adjusted 
accordingly.  In  the  absence  of  production  in  paying  quantities  from  a  unit,  or  upon  permanent  cessation  thereof,  Lessee 
may  terminate  the  unit  by  filing  of  record  a  written  declaration  describing  the  unit  and  stating  the  date  of  termination. 
Pooling  hereunder  shall  not  constitute  a  cross-conveyance  of  interests.  If  this  lease  now  or  hereafter  covers  separate 
tracts,  no  pooling  or  unitization  of  royalty  interest  as  between  any  such  separate  tracts  is  intended  or  shall  be  implied  or 
result  merely  from  the  inclusion  of  such  separate  tracts  within  this  Lease  but  Lessee  shall  nevertheless  have  the  right  to 
pool  as  provided  above  with  consequent  allocation  of  production  as  above  provided.  As  used  in  this  paragraph,  the  words 
"separate  tract"  mean  any  tract  with  royalty  ownership  differing,  now  or  hereafter,  either  as  to  parties  or  amounts,  from 
that  as  to  any  other  part  of  the  leased  premises. 

7.  Partial  Interests.  If  Lessor  owns  less  than  the  full  mineral  estate  in  all  or  any  part  of  the  leased  premises,  the 
royalties  and  shut-in  royalties  payable  hereunder  for  any  well  on  any  part  of  the  leased  premises  or  lands  pooled  therewith 
shall  be  reduced  to  the  proportion  that  Lessor's  interest  in  such  part  of  the  leased  premises  bears  to  the  fiill  mineral  estate 
in  such  part  of  the  leased  premises. 

8.  Assignment.  The  interest  of  either  Lessor  or  Lessee  hereunder  may  be  assigned,  devised  or  otherwise 
transferred  in  whole  or  in  part,  by  area  and/or  by  depth  or  zone,  and  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  parties  hereunder 


2 


shall  extend  to  their  respective  heirs,  devisees,  executors,  administrators,  successors  and  assigns  No  change  in  Lessor's 
ownership  shall  have  the  effect  of  reducing  the  rights  or  enlarging  the  obligations  of  Lessee  hereunder,  and  no  change  in 
ownership  shall  be  binding  on  Lessee  until  thirty  (30)  days  after  Lessee  has  been  furnished  the  original  or  certified  or  duly 
au  henticated  copies of  the  documents  establishing  such  change  of  ownership  to  the  reasonable  satisfaction  of  Lessee  or 
until  Lessor  has  satisfied  the  notificaUon  requirements  contained  in  Lessee's  usual  form  of  division  order.  Except  as 
otherwise  stated  herein,  .f  Lessee  transfers  its  interest  hereunder  in  whole  or  in  part,  Lessee  shall  be  relieved  of  all 
ob  iga  ions  thereafter  arising  with  respect  to  the  transferred  interest,  and  failure  of  the  transferee  to  satisfy  such 
obligations  with  respect  to  the  transferred  interest  shall  not  affect  the  rights  of  Lessee  with  respect  to  any  interest  not  so 
transferred  If  Lessee  transfers  a  full  or  undivided  interest  in  all  or  any  portion  of  the  area  covered  by  this  Lease  the 
obligation  to  pay  or  tender  shut-in  royalties  hereunder  shall  be  divided  between  Lessee  and  the  transferee  in  proportion  to 
the  net  acreage  interest  in  this  Lease  then  held  by  each.  F  F 

*  yease  ^  Vertical  Puyh  C1««se.  Lessee  may,  at  any  time  and  from  time  to  time,  deliver  to  Lessor  in 
recordable  form  or  file  of  record  a  written  release  of  this  Lease  as  to  a  full  or  undivided  interest  in  all  or  any  portion  of  the 
area  covered  by  this  Lease  or  any  depths  or  zones  thereunder,  and  shall  thereupon  be  relieved  of  all  obligations  thereafter 
ans.ng  with  respect  to  the  interest  so  released.  If  Lessee  releases  all  or  an  undivided  interest  in  less  than  all  of  the  area 
covered  hereby.  Lessee  s  obligation  to  pay  or  tender  shut-in  royalties  shall  be  proportionately  reduced  in  accordance  with 
toe  net  acreage  interest  retained  hereunder.  In  any  event,  upon  termination  of  this  Lease,  Lessee,  its  successors  or  assigns, 
shall  deliver  to  Lessor  a  recordable  release  as  to  such  portion  or  portions  of  this  Lease  which  have  terminated  under  the

renewal  of  the  primary  term,  or  after  cessation  of  operations  as  provided  herein,  whichever  occurs  last,  this  Lease  shall 
terminate  as  to  all  rights  lying  below  one  hundred  feet  (100')  below  either  (1)  the  deepest  depth  drilled  in  any  well  drilled 
on  the  leased  premises  or  on  lands  pooled  therewith  or  (2)  the  stratigraphic  equivalent  of  the  base  of  the  deepest  formation 
producing  or  capable  of  producing  in  any  well  drilled  on  the  leased  premises  or  on  lands  pooled  therewith,  whichever  is 

he  deepest;  provided  however,  if  Lessee  is  then  engaged  in  operations  on  the  leased  premises  or  on  lands  pooled

herein,  or  by  directional  or  horizontal  drilling  commenced  from  a  surface  location  on  other  lands.  Lessee  shall  make  all 
reasonable  efforts  not  to  use  residential  or  neighborhood  streets  or  thoroughfares  in  developing  the  leased  premises  any 
lands  pooled  therewith  or  otherwise. 

wolli1^  .HTT'  J!0^  level\afsociated  with  Less<*'s  operations  related  to  the  drilling,  completion  and  reworking  of 
wells  shall  be  kept  to  a  reasonable  minimum,  taking  into  consideration  reasonably  available  equipment  and  technology  in 
the  oil  and  gas  industry,  the  level  and  nature  of  development  and  surface  use  elsewhere  in  the  vicinity  of  Lessee's  drill 
sites  and  the  fact  Lessee  s  operations  are  being  conducted  in  or  near  an  urban  residential  area.  If  Lessee  utilizes  any  non- 
electnc-powered  equipment  in  its  operations,  Lessee  shall  take  reasonable  steps  to  muffle  the  sound  therefrom  by 
installing  a  noise  suppression  muffler  or  like  equipment. 

.  J*  Rylatory  Requirements  and  Force  Majeure.  Lessee's  obligations  under  this  Lease,  whether  express  or 
implied  shall  be  subject  to  all  applicable  laws,  rules,  regulations  and  orders  of  any  governmental  authority  having 
jurisdiction  including  environmental  regulations,  setback  requirements,  restrictions  on  the  drilling  and  production  of 
wells,  and  the  pnce  of  oil  gas  and  other  substances  covered  hereby.  To  the  extent  any  such  laws,  rules,  regulations  or 
orders  are  less  restrictive  than  the  terms  of  this  Lease,  this  Lease  shall  control.  When  drilling,  reworking  production  or 
other  operations  are  prevented  or  delayed  by  such  laws,  rules,  regulations  or  orders,  or  by  inability  to  obtein  necessary 
permits,  equipment  services,  material,  water,  electricity,  fuel,  access  or  easements,  or  by  fire,  flood,  adverse  weather 
conditions,  war,  sabotage  rebellion,  insurrection,  riot,  strike  or  labor  disputes,  or  by  inability  to  obtain  a  satisfactory 
market  for  production  or  failure  of  purchasers  or  carriers  to  take  or  transport  such  production,  or  by  any  other  cause  not 
reasonably  within  Lessee's  control,  this  Lease  shall  not  terminate  because  of  such  prevention  or  delay,  and  at  Lessee's 
option,  the  period  of  such  prevention  or  delay  shall  be  added  to  the  term  hereof.  Lessee  shall  not  be  liable  for  breach  of
