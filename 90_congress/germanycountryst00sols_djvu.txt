Foreword 


This  volume  is  one  in  a  continuing  series  of  books  prepared 
by  the  Federal  Research  Division  of  the  Library  of  Congress 
under  the  Country  Studies/Area  Handbook  Program  spon- 
sored by  the  Department  of  the  Army.  The  last  two  pages  of  this 
book  list  the  other  published  studies. 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  coun- 
try, describing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and 
national  security  systems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the 
interrelationships  of  those  systems  and  the  ways  they  are 
shaped  by  historical  and  cultural  factors.  Each  study  is  written 
by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social  scientists.  The  authors 
seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of  the  observed  society, 
striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static  portrayal.  Particular 
attention  is  devoted  to  the  people  who  make  up  the  society, 
their  origins,  dominant  beliefs  and  values,  their  common  inter- 
ests and  the  issues  on  which  they  are  divided,  the  nature  and 
extent  of  their  involvement  with  national  institutions,  and  their 
attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward  their  social  system  and 
political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should 
not  be  construed  as  an  expression  of  an  official  United  States 
government  position,  policy,  or  decision.  The  authors  have 
sought  to  adhere  to  accepted  standards  of  scholarly  objectivity. 
Corrections,  additions,  and  suggestions  for  changes  from  read- 
ers will  be  welcomed  for  use  in  future  editions.

Preface 


Like  its  predecessors,  East  Germany:  A  Country  Study  and  Fed- 
eral Republic  of  Germany:  A  Country  Study,  this  study  attempts  to 
review  Germany's  history  and  treat  in  a  concise  and  objective 
manner  its  dominant  social,  political,  economic,  and  military 
aspects.  Sources  of  information  included  books,  scholarly  jour- 
nals, foreign  and  domestic  newspapers,  official  reports  of  gov- 
ernment and  international  organizations,  and  numerous 
periodicals  on  German  and  international  affairs. 

The  name  Germany  is  used  in  three  senses:  first,  it  refers  to 
the  region  in  Central  Europe  commonly  regarded  as  constitut- 
ing Germany,  even  when  there  was  no  central  German  state,  as 
was  the  case  for  most  of  Germany's  history;  second,  it  refers  to 
the  unified  German  state  established  in  1871  and  existing  until 
1945;  and  third,  since  October  3,  1990,  it  refers  to  the  united 
Germany,  formed  by  the  accession  on  this  date  of  the  German 
Democratic  Republic  (GDR,  or  East  Germany)  to  the  Federal 
Republic  of  Germany  (FRG,  or  West  Germany).  The  name  Fed- 
eral Republic  of  Germany  refers  to  West  Germany  from  its  found- 
ing on  May  23,  1949,  until  German  unification  on  October  3, 
1990.  After  this  date,  it  refers  to  united  Germany.  For  the  sake 
of  brevity  and  variety,  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  is  often 
called  simply  the  Federal  Republic. 

The  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  consists  of  sixteen  states 
(Lander;  sing.,  Land).  Five  of  these  Lander  date  from  July  1990, 
when  the  territory  of  the  German  Democratic  Republic  was 
once  again  divided  into  Lander.  For  this  reason,  when  discuss- 
ing events  since  unification,  Germans  frequently  refer  to  the

attempts  to  reform  Soviet  Union  and  its  empire 
and  his  decision  not  to  intervene  militarily  in  East 
German  affairs,  lead  to  collapse  of  East  German 
regime,  late  1989-early  1990.

Introduction 


GERMANY  WAS  UNITED  on  October  3,  1990.  Unification 
brought  together  a  people  separated  for  more  than  four 
decades  by  the  division  of  Europe  into  two  hostile  blocs  in  the 
aftermath  of  World  War  II.  The  line  that  divided  the  continent 
ran  through  a  defeated  and  occupied  Germany.  By  late  1949, 
two  states  had  emerged  in  divided  Germany:  the  Federal 
Republic  of  Germany  (FRG,  or  West  Germany),  a  member  of 
the  Western  bloc  under  the  leadership  of  the  United  States; 
and  the  German  Democratic  Republic  (GDR,  or  East  Ger- 
many), part  of  the  Eastern  bloc  led  by  the  Soviet  Union. 
Although  the  two  German  states  were  composed  of  a  people 
speaking  one  language  and  sharing  the  same  traditions,  they 
came  to  have  the  political  systems  of  their  respective  blocs. 
West  Germany  developed  into  a  democratic  capitalist  state  like 
its  Western  neighbors;  East  Germany  had  imposed  on  it  the 
Soviet  Union's  communist  dictatorship  and  command  econ- 
omy. 

Although  the  leaders  of  each  state  were  committed  to  the 
eventual  unification  of  Germany  and  often  invoked  its  neces- 
sity, with  the  passage  of  time  the  likely  realization  of  unification 
receded  into  the  distant  future.  Relations  between  the  two 
states  worsened  during  the  1950s  as  several  million  East  Ger- 
mans, unwilling  to  live  in  an  increasingly  Stalinized  society,  fled 
to  the  West.  August  1961  saw  the  sealing  of  the  common  Ger- 
man border  with  the  construction  of  the  Berlin  Wall.  In  the 
early  1970s,  however,  diplomatic  relations  between  the  two 
states  were  regularized  by  the  Basic  Treaty,  signed  in  1972.  Dur- 
ing the  remainder  of  the  decade  and  during  the  1980s,  rela- 
tions improved,  and  contacts  between  the  citizens  of  the  two 
states  increased  greatly.  In  1987  Erich  Honecker  became  the 
first  East  German  leader  to  make  a  state  visit  to  West  Germany. 

As  of  the  late  1980s,  however,  no  well-informed  observer 
foresaw  German  unification  as  being  likely  in  the  near  future. 
In  fact,  its  prospect  seemed  so  remote  that  some  politicians 
advocated  abandoning  unification  as  a  long-term  goal.  Those 
who  remained  committed  to  Germany's  ultimate  unification 
frankly  admitted  that  decades  would  probably  pass  before  it 
happened.

The  events  leading  to  unification  in  October  1990  were 
unexpected,  and  they  occurred  at  a  frantic  pace.  In  the  eleven 
months  between  the  opening  of  the  Berlin  Wall  in  November 
1989  and  unification,  the  forty-year-old  East  German  dictator- 
ship collapsed,  Western  political  and  economic  systems  were 
introduced  in  the  East,  new  treaties  altered  long-standing  dip- 
lomatic relationships  between  Germany  and  neighboring 
states,  and  two  radically  different  societies  began  to  grow 
together. 

The  rapid  collapse  of  the  East  German  regime  surprised 
everyone.  East  Germany  appeared  to  be  the  most  economically 
successful  of  all  Eastern-bloc  countries.  Its  citizens  enjoyed  a 
modest  yet  decent  standard  of  living  and  cradle-to-grave  secu- 
rity provided  by  a  government-run  welfare  system.  They  trav- 
eled to  other  East  European  countries  for  their  summer 
vacations,  watched  West  German  television,  and  hoped  for  bet- 
ter living  conditions  and  more  freedom  in  the  future.  Most 
East  Germans  acquiesced  in  the  communist  regime's  restric- 
tions, having  fashioned  areas  of  personal  freedom  in  their  pri- 
vate lives.  A  small  opposition  movement  operated  within  the 
shelter  of  the  Protestant  church,  the  country's  sole  relatively 
independent  social  institution.  When  opposition  figures 
became  too  troublesome,  the  regime  dealt  with  them  by 
depriving  them  of  their  livelihood,  sending  them  to  prison,  or 
expelling  them  to  West  Germany. 

The  regime's  elderly,  hard-line  leadership  opposed  the 
reforms  of  Soviet  leader  Mikhail  Gorbachev,  who  sought  to 
make  socialism  more  efficient  by  introducing  capitalist  incen- 
tives and  reducing  central  control.  Encouraged  by  this  liberal- 
ization and  the  application  of  Gorbachev's  reforms  in 
neighboring  Poland  and  Hungary,  the  regime's  opponents 
became  bolder  during  the  summer  and  fall  of  1989  and 
mounted  mass  demonstrations  that  doubled  and  doubled 
again  in  size  from  week  to  week. 

Soviet  officials  advised  the  Honecker  regime  not  to  expect 
outside  support.  Without  foreign  military  assistance  for  the 
first  time,  the  GDR  leadership  decided  against  the  use  of  force 
to  quell  the  burgeoning  demonstrations.  Honecker  was  ousted 
in  mid-October,  and  more  realistic  leaders  sought  to  save  the 
regime  by  making  concessions.  In  November  travel  abroad 
became  possible,  and  East  Germans  swarmed  into  West  Ger- 
many, many  intending  to  remain  there.  Reforms  could  no 


xxxviii 


longer  satisfy  East  Germans,  however,  who  wanted  the  free- 
doms and  living  standard  of  West  Germany. 

West  German  chancellor  Helmut  Kohl  (1982-  )  seized  the 
political  initiative  in  late  November  with  his  Ten-Point  Plan  for 
unification.  Yet,  even  he  thought  several  years  and  an  interven- 
ing stage,  such  as  a  confederational  structure,  would  be  neces- 
sary before  unification  of  the  two  Germanys  could  occur.  By 
early  1990,  however,  the  need  to  stop  the  massive  flow  of  East 
Germans  westward  made  speedy  unification  imperative.  In 
addition,  revolutionary  change  in  other  Eastern-bloc  counties 
made  solutions  that  a  short  time  earlier  had  appeared  out  of 
the  question  suddenly  seem  feasible.  The  Treaty  on  Monetary, 
Economic,  and  Social  Union  between  the  two  German  states 
was  signed  in  May  and  went  into  effect  in  July.  The  two  Ger- 
manys signed  the  Unification  Treaty  in  August.  The  Treaty  on 
the  Final  Settlement  with  Respect  to  Germany,  the  so-called 
Two-Plus-Four  Treaty,  was  signed  in  September  by  the  two  Ger- 
manys and  the  four  victors  of  World  War  II — Britain,  France, 
the  Soviet  Union,  and  the  United  States.  The  treaty  restored 
full  sovereignty  to  Germany  and  ended  the  Cold  War  era. 

When  unification  occurred  on  October  3,  1990,  it  was  a 
happy,  yet  subdued  occasion.  The  many  problems  of  joining 
such  diverse  societies  were  already  apparent.  The  vaunted  East 
German  economy  was  coming  to  be  seen  as  a  Potemkin's  vil- 
lage, with  many  of  its  most  prestigious  firms  uncompetitive  in  a 
market  economy.  East  German  environmental  problems  were 
also  proving  much  more  serious  than  anyone  had  foreseen; 
remedies  would  cost  astronomical  sums.  West  Germans  had  dis- 
covered also  that  their  long-lost  eastern  cousins  differed  from 
them  in  many  ways  and  that  relations  between  them  were  often 
rife  with  misunderstandings.  A  complete  melding  of  the  two 
societies  would  take  years,  perhaps  even  a  generation  or  two. 
The  legal  unification  arranged  by  the  treaties  of  1990  was  only 
the  beginning  of  a  long  process  toward  a  truly  united  Germany. 

In  its  long  history,  Germany  has  rarely  been  united.  For  most 
of  the  two  millennia  that  central  Europe  has  been  inhabited  by 
German-speaking  peoples,  the  area  called  Germany  was 
divided  into  hundreds  of  states,  many  quite  small,  including 
duchies,  principalities,  free  cities,  and  ecclesiastical  states.  Not 
even  the  Romans  united  Germany  under  one  government; 
they  managed  to  occupy  only  its  southern  and  western  por- 
tions. At  the  beginning  of  the  ninth  century,  Charlemagne 


xxx  IX 


established  an  empire,  but  within  a  generation  its  existence  was 
more  symbolic  than  real. 

Medieval  Germany  was  marked  by  division.  As  France  and 
England  began  their  centuries-long  evolution  into  united 
nation-states,  Germany  was  racked  by  a  ceaseless  series  of  wars 
among  local  rulers.  The  Habsburg  Dynasty's  long  monopoly  of 
the  crown  of  the  Holy  Roman  Empire  provided  only  the  sem- 
blance of  German  unity.  Within  the  empire,  German  princes 
warred  against  one  another  as  before.  The  Protestant  Reforma- 
tion deprived  Germany  of  even  its  religious  unity,  leaving  its 
population  Roman  Catholic,  Lutheran,  and  Calvinist.  These 
religious  divisions  gave  military  strife  an  added  ferocity  in  the 
Thirty  Years'  War  (1618-48),  during  which  Germany  was  rav- 
aged to  a  degree  not  seen  again  until  World  War  II. 

The  Peace  of  Westphalia  of  1648  left  Germany  divided  into 
hundreds  of  states.  During  the  next  two  centuries,  the  two  larg- 
est of  these  states — Prussia  and  Austria — -jockeyed  for  domi- 
nance. The  smaller  states  sought  to  retain  their  independence 
by  allying  themselves  with  one,  then  the  other,  depending  on 
local  conditions.  From  the  mid-1 790s  until  Prussia,  Austria,  and 
Russia  defeated  Napoleon  at  the  Battle  of  Leipzig  in  1813  and 
drove  him  out  of  Germany,  much  of  the  country  was  occupied 
by  French  troops.  Napoleon's  officials  abolished  numerous 
small  states,  and,  as  a  result,  in  1815,  after  the  Congress  of 
Vienna,  Germany  consisted  of  about  forty  states. 

During  the  next  half-century,  pressures  for  German  unifica- 
tion grew.  Scholars,  bureaucrats,  students,  journalists,  and  busi- 
nessmen agitated  for  a  united  Germany  that  would  bring  with 
it  uniform  laws  and  a  single  currency  and  that  would  replace 
the  benighted  absolutism  of  petty  German  states  with  democ- 
racy. The  revolutions  of  1848  seemed  at  first  likely  to  realize 
this  dream  of  unity  and  freedom,  but  the  monarch  who  was 
offered  the  crown  of  a  united  Germany,  King  Friedrich  Wil- 
helm  IV  of  Prussia,  rejected  it.  The  king,  like  the  other  rulers 
of  Germany's  kingdoms,  opposed  German  unity  because  he 
saw  it  as  a  threat  to  his  power. 

Despite  the  opposition  of  conservative  forces,  German  unifi- 
cation came  just  over  two  decades  later,  in  1871,  when  Ger- 
many was  unified  and  transformed  into  an  empire  under 
Emperor  Wilhelm  I,  king  of  Prussia.  Unification  was  not 
brought  about  by  revolutionary  or  liberal  forces,  but  by  a  con- 
servative Prussian  aristocrat,  Otto  von  Bismarck.  Sensing  the 
power  of  nationalism,  Bismarck  sought  to  use  it  for  his  own 


xl 


aims,  the  preservation  of  a  feudal  social  order  and  the  triumph 
of  his  country,  Prussia,  in  the  long  contest  with  Austria  for  pre- 
eminence in  Germany.  By  a  series  of  masterful  diplomatic 
maneuvers  and  three  brief  and  dazzlingly  successful  military 
campaigns,  Bismarck  achieved  a  united  Germany  without  Aus- 
tria. He  brought  together  the  so-called  "small  Germany,"  con- 
sisting of  Prussia  and  the  remaining  German  states,  some  of 
which  had  been  subdued  by  Prussian  armies  before  they 
became  part  of  a  Germany  ruled  by  a  Prussian  emperor. 

Although  united  Germany  had  a  parliament,  the  Reichstag, 
elected  through  universal  male  suffrage,  supreme  power  rested 
with  the  emperor  and  his  ministers,  who  were  not  responsible 
to  the  Reichstag.  Although  the  Reichstag  could  contest  the  gov- 
ernment's decisions,  in  the  end  the  emperor  could  largely  gov- 
ern as  he  saw  fit.  Supporting  the  emperor  were  the  nobility, 
large  rural  landowners,  business  and  financial  elites,  the  civil 
service,  the  Protestant  clergy,  and  the  military.  The  military, 
which  had  made  unification  possible,  enjoyed  tremendous 
prestige.  Led  by  an  aristocratic  officer  corps  sworn  to  feudal 
values  and  opposed  to  parliamentary  democracy  and  the  rights 
of  a  free  citizenry,  the  military  embodied  the  spirit  of  the  Ger- 
man Empire. 

Opposition  to  this  authoritarian  regime  with  its  feudal  struc- 
tures was  found  mainly  in  the  Roman  Catholic  Center  Party, 
the  Socialist  Party,  and  in  a  variety  of  liberal  and  regional  polit- 
ical groups  opposed  to  Prussia's  hegemony  over  Germany.  In 
the  long  term,  Bismarck  and  his  successors  were  not  able  to 
subjugate  this  opposition.  By  1912  the  Socialists  had  come  to 
have  the  largest  number  of  representatives  in  the  Reichstag. 
They  and  the  Center  Party  made  governing  increasingly  diffi- 
cult for  the  empire's  conservative  leadership. 

Despite  the  presence  of  these  opposition  groups,  however,  a 
truly  representative  parliamentary  democracy  did  not  exist.  As 
a  result,  Germans  had  little  opportunity  to  learn  the  art  of 
practical  politics.  With  few  exceptions,  this  had  also  been  the 
case  throughout  German  history.  Although  Germany's  states 
were  usually  well  managed  by  an  efficient  and  honest  civil  ser- 
vice, they  were  authoritarian.  Government  was  seen  as  the  busi- 
ness of  the  rulers;  the  ruled  were  to  be  obedient  and  silent. 

Because  they  were  inexperienced  in  democratic  govern- 
ment, Germans  in  the  nineteenth  century  were  often  viewed  as 
political  children,  incapable  of  governing  themselves.  In  addi- 
tion, seeing  the  excesses  of  the  French  Revolution,  many 


xli 


thoughtful  Germans  came  to  the  conclusion  that  democracy 
was  not  suitable  for  Germany.  The  success  of  democratic  politi- 
cal institutions  in  Britain  and  the  United  States  did  not  con- 
vince these  skeptics;  they  feared  that  the  passions  of  the 
ignorant  masses  could  too  easily  be  inflamed.  Even  many  Ger- 
man liberals  found  the  idea  that  ordinary  citizens  ought  to 
determine  how  public  business  should  be  conducted  too  radi- 
cal a  notion.  Instead,  they  recommended  that  parliaments  con- 
sisting of  the  educated  and  the  prosperous  should  serve  as 
advisory  bodies  to  noble  rulers. 

Germany's  defeat  in  World  War  I  in  1918  meant  the  end  of 
the  German  Empire.  The  emperor  was  forced  to  abdicate,  and 
a  republic — the  Weimar  Republic — was  established  with  a  con- 
stitution that  provided  for  a  parliamentary  democracy  in  which 
the  government  was  ultimately  responsible  to  the  people.  The 
new  republic's  first  president  and  prime  minister  were  con- 
vinced democrats,  and  Germany  seemed  ready  at  last  to  join 
the  community  of  democratic  nations. 

The  Weimar  Republic  ultimately  disappointed  those  who 
had  hoped  it  would  introduce  democracy  to  Germany.  By  mid- 
1933  it  had  been  destroyed  by  Adolf  Hitler,  its  declared  enemy 
since  his  first  days  in  the  public  arena.  Hitler  was  a  political 
genius  who  sensed  and  exploited  the  worries  and  resentments 
of  many  Germans,  knew  when  to  act,  and  possessed  a  sure 
instinct  for  power.  His  greatest  weapon  in  his  quest  for  political 
power,  however,  was  the  disdain  many  Germans  felt  for  the  new 
republic. 

Many  Germans  held  the  Weimar  Republic  responsible  for 
Germany's  defeat.  At  the  war's  end,  no  foreign  troops  stood  on 
German  soil,  and  military  victory  still  seemed  likely.  Instead  of 
victory,  however,  in  the  view  of  many,  the  republic's  Socialist 
politicians  arranged  a  humiliating  peace.  Many  Germans  were 
also  affronted  by  the  spectacle  of  parliamentary  politics.  The 
republic's  numerous  small  parties  made  forming  stable  and 
coherent  coalition  governments  very  difficult.  Frequent  elec- 
tions failed  to  yield  effective  governments.  Government  poli- 
cies also  often  failed  to  solve  pressing  social  and  economic 
problems. 

These  shortcomings  undermined  the  legitimacy  of  the 
Weimar  Republic.  The  upper  classes,  the  judiciary,  the  police, 
the  civil  service,  educators,  the  military,  and  much  of  the  mid- 
dle class  gave  the  republic  only  halfhearted  support  at  best. 
Many  members  of  these  groups  despised  the  republic  and 


xlii 


wanted  it  replaced  with  an  authoritarian  system  of  government. 
The  early  years  of  the  Weimar  Republic  saw  frequent  attempts 
to  destroy  it  by  force,  mostly  from  the  right,  but  also  from  the 
left. 

A  modest  economic  recovery  from  1924  to  1929  gave  the 
Weimar  Republic  a  brief  respite.  The  severe  social  stress  engen- 
dered by  the  Great  Depression,  however,  swelled  the  vote 
received  by  extreme  antidemocratic  parties  in  the  election  of 
1930  and  the  two  elections  of  1932.  The  government  ruled  by 
emergency  decree.  In  January  1933,  leading  conservative  poli- 
ticians formed  a  new  government  with  Hitler  as  chancellor. 
They  intended  to  harness  him  and  his  party,  now  the  country's 
largest,  to  realize  their  own  aim  of  replacing  the  republic  with 
an  authoritarian  government.  Within  a  few  months,  however, 
Hitler  had  outmaneuvered  them  and  established  a  totalitarian 
regime.  Only  in  1945  did  a  military  alliance  of  dozens  of 
nations  succeed  in  deposing  him,  and  only  after  his  regime  and 
the  nation  it  ruled  had  committed  crimes  of  unparalleled  enor- 
mity. 

In  the  aftermath  of  World  War  II,  Germany  came  to  consist 
of  two  states.  One,  East  Germany,  never  attained  real  legitimacy 
in  the  eyes  of  its  citizens  and  had  to  use  force  to  prevent  them 
from  fleeing  to  the  West.  The  other,  West  Germany,  was 
resoundingly  successful. Within  two  decades  of  defeat,  it  had 
become  one  of  the  world's  richest  nations,  with  a  prosperity 
that  extended  to  all  segments  of  the  population.  The  economy 
performed  so  successfully  that  eventually  several  million  for- 
eigners came  to  West  Germany  to  work  as  well.  West  German 
and  foreign  workers  alike  were  protected  from  need  arising 
from  sickness,  accidents,  and  old  age  by  an  extensive,  mostly 
nongovernment  welfare  system. 

Along  with  this  material  success,  a  vigorous  democracy  devel- 
oped. To  avoid  the  Weimar  Republic's  weak  coalition  govern- 
ments, the  West  German  constitution,  the  Basic  Law,  permitted 
only  those  parties  with  at  least  5  percent  of  the  vote  to  sit  in  the 
Bundestag,  the  lower  house  of  its  parliament.  This  provision 
meant  that  stable  parliamentary  governments  could  be  formed 
fairly  easily,  and  efficient  government  became  possible.  In  con- 
trast to  the  Weimar  Republic,  the  Basic  Law  banned  political 
parties  opposed  to  democracy. 

From  the  first  national  election  in  1949,  West  German  poli- 
tics has  been  dominated  by  two  large  catchall  parties  (Volks- 
parteien;  sing.,  Volkspartei) ,  whose  support  came  from  voters 


xliii 


formerly  allied  to  many  smaller  parties.  The  moderate  Chris- 
tian Democratic  Union  (Christlich  Demokratische  Union — 
CDU),  allied  with  its  small  sister  party  active  in  Bavaria,  the 
Christian  Social  Union  (Christlich-Soziale  Union — CSU),  won 
the  votes  of  a  broad  range  of  Roman  Catholic  and  Protestant 
voters.  For  the  first  time  in  German  history,  members  of  the 
two  religions  worked  together  to  attain  their  political  goals. 
The  CDU/CSU  also  had  left  and  right  wings,  which  had  to 
cooperate  if  the  alliance  were  to  win  elections  and  exercise 
power.  After  much  debate,  the  CDU/CSU's  various  wings  for- 
mulated the  concept  of  a  social  market  economy — free-market 
capitalism  combined  with  an  extensive  social  net.  The  CDU/ 
CSU  alliance  has  successfully  held  together  its  diverse  member- 
ship and,  with  the  exception  of  the  1969-82  period,  has 
headed  all  the  Federal  Republic's  governments  since  1949, 
when  CDU  leader  Konrad  Adenauer  became  the  country's  first 
chancellor. 

The  Federal  Republic's  other  large  popular  party  is  the 
Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialdemokratische 
Partei  Deutschlands — SPD),  which  receives  much  of  the  work- 
ing-class vote.  In  the  early  years  of  the  Federal  Republic,  the 
SPD  was  feared  by  many  voters  because  of  its  socialist  aims. 
With  time,  however,  the  party  moderated  its  positions;  for 
example,  it  accepted  West  German  rearmament  in  the  mid- 
1950s  and  came  to  support  the  social  market  economy.  It  also 
won  the  trust  of  suspicious  voters  by  participating  in  many  local 
and  state  {Land;  pi.,  Lander)  governments.  After  joining  with 
the  CDU/CSU  to  form  a  coalition  government  at  the  national 
level  from  1966  to  1969,  the  SPD  and  the  small,  liberal  Free 
Democratic  Party  (Freie  Demokratische  Partei — FDP)  formed 
a  coalition  government  with  SDP  leader  Willy  Brandt  as  chan- 
cellor. The  SPD-FDP  coalition  lasted  until  1982.  In  that  year, 
the  FDP  and  the  CDU/CSU  formed  a  new  coalition  govern- 
ment with  Helmut  Kohl  as  chancellor,  a  coalition  still  in  power 
in  mid-1996. 

Many  observers  maintain  that  German  democracy  is  in  a 
transition  stage.  The  SPD  has  lost  its  most  steady  source  of  sup- 
port as  an  increasingly  advanced  economy  has  reduced  the  size 
of  the  blue-collar  working  class.  An  increasingly  secular  and 
sophisticated  society  has  also  cut  into  the  CDU/CSU  stable 
pool  of  confessional  voters.  Thus,  since  the  1980s,  the  large 
catchall  parties  have  been  confronted  with  an  increasingly  vola- 
tile electorate.  Both  parties  have  experienced  declining  mem- 


xliv 


berships.  As  these  parties  have  worked  to  woo  a  more  diverse 
electorate,  they  have  moderated  their  stances  to  such  a  degree 
that  many  voters  have  difficulty  telling  them  apart. 

Despite  CDU  losses  in  the  October  1994  national  elections, 
the  CDU/CSU-FDP  coalition  survived,  but  with  a  majority  of 
only  ten  seats.  The  SPD's  share  of  the  vote  rose  in  these  elec- 
tions, but  not  enough  to  take  power  at  the  national  level.  The 
SPD  has  been  more  successful  in  elections  at  the  Land  level  in 
recent  years  and  has  often  controlled  the  Bundesrat,  parlia- 
ment's upper  house.  However,  it  lost  its  sole  control  of  North 
Rhine-Westphalia  in  the  elections  of  May  1995  and  did  even 
worse  in  October  1995  Land  elections  in  Berlin.  SPD  leader 
Rudolf  Sharping  was  deposed  a  month  later  and  replaced  by 
Oskar  Lafontaine,  who  had  led  the  party  to  defeat  in  the  1990 
national  elections.  Lafontaine's  resurrection  did  not  appear  to 
solve  the  party's  long-standing  leadership  problem  because  it 
lost  badly  in  the  Land  elections  of  March  1996  in  Schleswig- 
Holstein,  Rhineland-Palatinate,  and  Baden-Wurttemberg. 

As  the  two  large  parties  face  diminishing  pools  of  secure 
votes,  growing  numbers  of  young  and  educated  voters  have 
come  to  support  the  ecological  party,  Alliance  90/The  Greens 
(Bundnis  90/Die  Grunen),  which,  after  having  elected  its  first 
representatives  to  the  Bundestag  in  1983,  in  1994  became  the 
body's  third-largest  party,  displacing  the  FDR  As  of  mid-1996, 
the  Greens  had  a  skilled  leader,  Joschka  Fischer,  who  has  trans- 
formed the  party  from  a  group  of  apolitical  idealists  into  a 
highly  pragmatic,  but  still  principled,  political  force  that  exam- 
ines nearly  every  facet  of  German  life  from  a  fresh  standpoint. 
Some  observers  hold  that  the  party  represents  the  future  of 
German  politics. 

The  party  displaced  by  the  Greens,  the  FDP,  has  been  a  part- 
ner in  all  coalition  governments  at  the  national  level  since 
1969.  Pledged  to  classic  European  liberal  political  values,  the 
FDP  has  distinguished  itself  by  its  advocacy  of  the  legal  rights  of 
the  individual.  In  recent  years,  however,  the  party  has  struggled 
for  its  survival  because  of  leadership  problems  and  because  its 
close  embrace  of  the  CDU/CSU  has  caused  it  to  lose  its  politi- 
cal identity  in  the  eyes  of  many  voters.  By  late  1995,  the  party 
seemed  on  the  verge  of  political  extinction;  it  suffered  a  steep 
drop  in  its  vote  in  the  national  election  of  October  1994  and  a 
long  string  of  losses  in  elections  at  the  Land  level.  In  March 
1996,  however,  the  FDP  increased  its  vote  and  won  seats  in  all 
three  Land  elections  held  during  the  month.  Although  the 


xlv 


FDP  was  represented  in  only  four  Land  parliaments  as  of  mid- 
1996,  these  election  results  allow  the  party  to  retain  its  role  as  a 
coalition-maker  in  governments  at  the  national  level. 

In  addition  to  the  Greens,  another  new  party  that  has  altered 
German  politics  is  the  Party  of  Democratic  Socialism  (Partei 
des  Demokratischen  Sozialismus — PDS).  Able  to  win  votes  only 
in  eastern  Germany,  the  PDS  has  the  support  of  voters  who 
regret  the  extent  to  which  or  the  way  in  which  East  Germany 
was  swallowed  up  by  the  Federal  Republic.  Although  the  PDS  is 
the  successor  to  East  Germany's  communist  Socialist  Unity 
Party  of  Germany  (Sozialistische  Einheitspartei  Deutsch- 
lands — SED),  it  does  not  recommend  that  the  East  German 
regime  be  restored.  Rather,  it  demands  that  eastern  German 
interests  be  given  greater  respect  by  western  Germans,  who  are 
often  seen  as  arrogant  and  overbearing  by  eastern  Germans. 
The  PDS  has  thirty  seats  in  the  Bundestag  and  is  represented  in 
the  parliaments  of  the  eastern  Lander,  but  is  not  a  partner  in 
any  coalition.  Because  the  PDS  owes  its  success  to  the  some- 
times legitimate  anger  of  easterners  at  how  they  have  fared  in  a 
united  Germany,  observers  believe  that  the  influence  of  the 
PDS  will  wane  as  these  Lander  become  more  integrated  into 
united  Germany. 

In  addition  to  the  above  parties,  several  small  right-wing  par- 
ties are  politically  active.  None  have  representatives  in  the 
Bundestag.  The  Republikaner,  which  at  about  25,000  members 
is  the  largest  of  these  parties,  has  representatives  in  the  Baden- 
Wurttemberg  parliament  after  winning  11  percent  of  the  vote 
in  1992  and  9  percent  of  the  vote  in  elections  there  in  March 
1996.  The  campaigns  of  these  right-wing  parties  are  based 
mainly  on  a  fervid  nationalism  and  a  dislike  of  Germany's  for- 
eign residents.  They  stop  short  of  clearly  espousing  Hitlerian 
doctrines,  however,  because  doing  so  would  mean  their  being 
banned  and  their  leaders  possibly  being  imprisoned. 

In  addition  to  parties  of  the  extreme  right,  authorities  esti- 
mate that  a  few  thousand  violent  right-wing  extremists  are 
active  within  Germany.  Most  are  disaffected  young  males  with 
few  job  prospects.  Although  comparatively  few  in  number  in  a 
country  of  80  million,  they  have  received  international  atten- 
tion when  they  have  attacked  or  killed  foreign  workers  living  in 
Germany  or  vandalized  Jewish  cemeteries  or  synagogues.  The 
world's  alarm  at  such  occurrences  is  easily  understandable, 
given  Germany's  history  in  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth  cen- 
tury. Yet  few  observers  believe  that  these  extreme  right-wing 


xlvi 


elements  pose  a  threat  to  German  democracy  or  have  any 
chance  of  gaining  political  influence,  let  alone  coming  to 
power. 

Germans  of  the  late  twentieth  century  differ  greatly  from 
those  of  its  first  half.  The  extreme  nationalism  of  the  interwar 
period  finds  little  support  in  the  Germany  of  the  1990s,  for 
example.  Unlike  Germany's  failure  to  achieve  victory  in  World 
War  I,  which  to  many  Germans  of  the  interwar  period 
appeared  to  have  been  caused  by  the  treachery  of  Socialist  pol- 
iticians rather  than  by  military  defeat,  Germany's  uncondi- 
tional surrender  in  1945  was  obviously  unavoidable  given  the 
military  situation  at  the  war's  end.  Moreover,  because  Hitler 
clearly  started  the  war,  Germany  is  judged,  to  some  extent  at 
least,  to  have  deserved  its  terrible  consequences.  Thus,  in  con- 
trast to  Germans  of  the  interwar  period,  few  postwar  Germans 
have  demanded  revenge  for  Germany's  sufferings  or  advocated 
the  seizure  of  lost  territory.  This  absence  of  an  aggressive 
nationalism  can  be  seen  in  the  foreign  policy  of  the  Federal 
Republic.  Unlike  the  diplomacy  of  the  empire  and  the  Hitler 
regime,  this  foreign  policy  has  always  had  as  its  first  principle 
multilateralism,  a  principle  realized  through  Germany's  active 
membership  in  a  great  variety  of  international  organizations. 

Germans  have  also  become  convinced  democrats.  They 
understand  and  appreciate  the  workings  of  parliamentary 
democracy  with  its  loyal  opposition,  concessions,  and  the 
peaceful  passing  of  power  from  one  government  to  another; 
they  know  the  importance  of  an  independent  judiciary  in  pro- 
tecting individual  rights;  and  they  value  a  free  and  powerful 
press.  Under  a  democratic  system  of  government,  West  Ger- 
mans have  experienced  the  most  successful  period  of  German 
history,  and,  whatever  the  system's  failings,  they  are  unwilling 
to  reject  it  for  panaceas  of  earlier  eras.  Eastern  Germans  are 
now  learning  Western  democratic  values  after  decades  of  polit- 
ical repression.  Having  experienced  a  multitude  of  political 
and  economic  disasters  under  totalitarian  regimes  of  the  right 
and  the  left,  Germans  have  matured  and  become  political 
adults  no  longer  susceptible  to  the  Utopian  promises  of  dema- 
gogues. 

Germany  does  face  some  serious  challenges  in  the  second 
half  of  the  1990s  and  in  the  new  century.  The  most  immediate 
challenge  is  to  fully  integrate  eastern  Germany  and  its  inhabit- 
ants into  the  advanced  social  market  economy  and  society  of 
western  Germany. 


xlvii 


As  of  mid-1996,  much  had  already  been  done  to  foster  the 
formation  of  a  strong  eastern  economy  and  to  bring  its  compo- 
nents up  to  global  standards.  In  the  1990-95  period,  more  than 
US$650  billion  had  been  transferred  from  western  Germany  to 
eastern  Germany.  This  enormous  financial  infusion  has  mark- 
edly improved  eastern  living  standards,  and  specialists  believe 
that  by  the  late  1990s,  the  east's  infrastructure  will  be  the  most 
advanced  in  Europe.  Unemployment  in  eastern  Germany  has 
consistently  remained  at  about  15  percent,  however,  about  one- 
third  above  the  national  level,  despite  eastern  growth  rates 
about  three  times  higher  than  those  in  western  Germany.  Many 
of  the  older  jobless  are  not  likely  to  find  employment  compara- 
ble to  what  they  had  under  the  communist  system.  Yet,  many 
eastern  Germans  have  fared  well  in  the  new  economy  and  have 
adapted  well  to  its  demands. 

Achieving  complete  social  unification  is  expected  to  take  a 
generation  or  two.  Decades  of  life  in  diverse  societies  have  cre- 
ated two  peoples  with  different  attitudes.  Easterners  are  gener- 
ally less  ambitious  and  concerned  with  their  careers  than  their 
western  counterparts.  Their  more  relaxed  work  ethic  some- 
times raises  the  ire  of  western  Germans.  Many  easterners  also 
take  offense  at  what  has  seemed  to  them  arrogant  or  patroniz- 
ing attitudes  of  westerners.  The  "implosion"  of  East  Germany 
in  1990  prevented  a  slower,  more  nuanced  introduction  of 
Western  institutions  and  habits  of  thought  to  the  east  that 
would  have  resulted  in  fewer  bruised  feelings.  Polls  of  recent 
years  have  found  a  growing  convergence  of  beliefs  and  opin- 
ions between  the  two  peoples,  however,  a  trend  almost  certain 
to  continue. 

The  most  serious  problem  confronting  Germany  in  the  long 
term  is  one  faced  by  all  advanced,  high-wage  industrial  coun- 
tries— how  to  meet  the  challenges  posed  by  an  increasingly  glo- 
balized economy  in  which  highly  skilled  workers  of  lesser 
developed  countries  are  available  at  one-tenth  the  wages  of 
wealthy  countries.  For  Germany  these  countries  are  not  located 
only  in  Asia,  but  next  door  in  the  former  Eastern  bloc.  By  the 
1990s,  German  wages  were  among  the  world's  highest,  some  50 
percent  higher  than  those  of  the  United  States,  for  example. 
Germany's  extensive  social  safety  net  is  a  principal  reason  for 
its  high  wage  cost,  yet  no  political  party  can  expect  to  signifi- 
cantly cut  into  social  programs  and  retain  the  favor  of  voters. 

In  addition  to  high  wages,  the  German  economy  faces  struc- 
tural problems  because  the  areas  in  which  it  has  long  been 


xlviii 


strongest — the  chemical  industry  and  machine  production,  for 
example — are  not  areas  in  which  most  future  economic  growth 
will  occur.  Having  been  so  successful  in  their  traditional  fields 
of  expertise,  German  businessmen  are  somewhat  conservative, 
not  given  to  risky  entrepreneurship,  and  have  not  invested  in 
new  areas  such  as  computers  and  biotechnology.  Economists 
see  little  reason  to  believe  that  Germany  can  overtake  the  lead- 
ers in  these  fields,  most  notably  the  United  States  and  Japan. 

Germany  also  faces  serious  demographic  problems.  Popula- 
tion growth  in  recent  decades  has  been  slow;  in  many  years,  the 
number  of  Germans  has  actually  declined  because  the  birth 
rate  has  been  so  low.  Given  this  long-standing  trend,  specialists 
wonder  how  Germans  will  continue  to  maintain  their  generous 
pension  system,  an  unfunded  system  that  operates  on  the  pay- 
as-you-go  principle,  according  to  which  retirees  are  supported 
by  today's  workers.  If  present  trends  continue,  by  2030  the  ratio 
of  retirees  to  workers  will  be  one  to  one. 

An  obvious  solution  to  this  problem  is  to  import  workers. 
However,  because  Germans  do  not  regard  their  country  as  a 
nation  of  immigrants,  importing  workers  is  not  currently  seen 
as  a  politically  acceptable  solution.  As  of  the  mid-1990s,  Ger- 
many had  about  7  million  foreign  residents,  including  2  mil- 
lion Muslims,  and  more  foreign  workers  are  not  wanted. 
Germany  has  not  yet  successfully  integrated  the  foreigners 
already  on  its  soil:  archaic  immigration  laws  make  it  difficult  to 
became  a  German  citizen,  and  xenophobic  attitudes  of  many 
Germans  often  make  foreign  residents,  even  those  born  and 
raised  in  the  country  and  speaking  perfect  German,  feel 
unwanted.  In  time,  demographic  realities  may  cause  Germans 
to  view  more  favorably  the  permanent  presence  of  a  substantial 
non-German  population  and  lead  them  to  adopt  more  liberal 
notions  of  citizenship. 

Unification  and  the  ending  of  the  Cold  War  have  meant  that 
Germany  must  adjust  itself  to  a  new  international  environ- 
ment. The  disastrous  failures  of  German  foreign  policy  in  the 
first  half  of  the  twentieth  century  have  caused  Germans  to 
approach  this  challenge  warily.  Until  the  demise  of  the  Soviet 
Union,  Germans  could  enjoy  the  certainties  of  the  Cold  War, 
both  they  and  their  neighbors  secure  in  the  knowledge  that  the 
superpowers  would  contain  any  possible  German  aggression. 

Throughout  the  postwar  era,  West  Germany  was  a  model  cit- 
izen of  the  community  of  nations,  content  to  be  the  most 
devoted  participant  in  the  movement  toward  Europe's  eco- 


xlix 


nomic  and  social  unification.  West  German  politicians  shared 
the  fears  of  their  foreign  neighbors  of  a  resurgent,  aggressive 
Germany  and  sought  to  ensure  their  country's  containment  by 
embedding  it  in  international  organizations.  In  the  mid-1950s, 
for  example,  West  Germany  rearmed,  but  as  a  member  of  the 
North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO — see  Glossary) . 

Since  the  end  of  the  Cold  War,  however,  united  Germany  has 
occupied  an  exposed  position  in  Central  Europe,  with  settled, 
secure  neighbors  in  the  west  and  unpredictable  and  insecure 
neighbors  to  the  east.  Because  of  this  exposure,  German  policy 
makers  wish  to  extend  the  European  Union  (EU — see  Glos- 
sary) and  NATO  eastward,  at  a  minimum  bringing  Poland,  the 
Czech  Republic,  and  Hungary  into  both  organizations.  In  the 
German  view,  these  countries  could  serve  as  a  buffer  between 
Germany  and  uncertain  developments  in  Russia  and  other 
members  of  the  former  Soviet  Union.  At  the  same  time  as  this 
so-called  widening  of  West  European  institutions  is  being 
undertaken,  Germany  is  working  for  their  deepening  by  press- 
ing for  increased  European  unity.  As  of  mid-1996,  Helmut  Kohl 
remained  the  continent's  most  important  advocate  of  realizing 
a  common  European  currency  through  the  European  Mone- 
tary Union  (EMU — see  Glossary)  by  the  turn  of  the  century. 
However  unrealistic  this  timetable  may  prove  to  be,  in  the  post- 
war era  Germany  has  steadfastly  worked  to  realize  German 
writer  Thomas  Mann's  ideal  of  a  Europeanized  Germany  and 
rejected  his  nightmare  of  a  Germanized  Europe.

PEOPLE  HAVE  DWELLED  for  thousands  of  years  in  the  terri- 
tory now  occupied  by  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany.  The 
first  significant  written  account  of  this  area's  inhabitants  is  Ger- 
mania,  written  about  A.D.  98  by  the  Roman  historian  Tacitus. 
The  Germanic  tribes  he  describes  are  believed  to  have  come 
from  Scandinavia  to  Germany  about  100  B.C.,  perhaps  induced 
to  migrate  by  overpopulation.  The  Germanic  tribes  living  to 
the  west  of  the  Rhine  River  and  south  of  the  Main  River  were 
soon  subdued  by  the  Romans  and  incorporated  into  the 
Roman  Empire.  Tribes  living  to  the  east  and  north  of  these  riv- 
ers remained  free  but  had  more  or  less  friendly  relations  with 
the  Romans  for  several  centuries.  Beginning  in  the  fourth  cen- 
tury A.D.,  new  westward  migrations  of  eastern  peoples  caused 
the  Germanic  tribes  to  move  into  the  Roman  Empire,  which  by 
the  late  fifth  century  ceased  to  exist. 

One  of  the  largest  Germanic  tribes,  the  Franks,  came  to  con- 
trol the  territory  that  was  to  become  France  and  much  of  what 
is  now  western  Germany  and  Italy.  In  A.D.  800  their  ruler, 
Charlemagne,  was  crowned  in  Rome  by  the  pope  as  emperor  of 
all  of  this  territory.  Because  of  its  vastness,  Charlemagne's 
empire  split  into  three  kingdoms  within  two  generations,  the 
inhabitants  of  the  West  Frankish  Kingdom  speaking  an  early 
form  of  French  and  those  in  the  East  Frankish  Kingdom  speak- 
ing an  early  form  of  German.  The  tribes  of  the  eastern  king- 
dom— Franconians,  Saxons,  Bavarians,  Swabians,  and  several 
others — were  ruled  by  descendants  of  Charlemagne  until  911, 
when  they  elected  a  Franconian,  Conrad  I,  to  be  their  king. 
Some  historians  regard  Conrad's  election  as  the  beginning  of 
what  can  properly  be  considered  German  history. 

German  kings  soon  added  the  Middle  Kingdom  to  their 
realm  and  adjudged  themselves  rulers  of  what  would  later  be 
called  the  Holy  Roman  Empire.  In  962  Otto  I  became  the  first 
of  the  German  kings  crowned  emperor  in  Rome.  By  the  middle 
of  the  next  century,  the  German  lands  ruled  by  the  emperors 
were  the  richest  and  most  politically  powerful  part  of  Europe. 
German  princes  stopped  the  westward  advances  of  the  Magyar 
tribe,  and  Germans  began  moving  eastward  to  begin  a  long 
process  of  colonization.  During  the  next  few  centuries,  how- 
ever, the  great  expense  of  the  wars  to  maintain  the  empire 
against  its  enemies,  chiefly  other  German  princes  and  the

wealthy  and  powerful  papacy  and  its  allies,  depleted  Germany's 
wealth  and  slowed  its  development.  Unlike  France  or  England, 
where  a  central  royal  power  was  slowly  established  over 
regional  princes,  Germany  remained  divided  into  a  multitude 
of  smaller  entities  often  warring  with  one  another  or  in  combi- 
nations against  the  emperors.  None  of  the  local  princes,  or  any 
of  the  emperors,  were  strong  enough  to  control  Germany  for  a 
sustained  period. 

Germany's  so-called  particularism,  that  is,  the  existence 
within  it  of  many  states  of  various  sizes  and  kinds,  such  as  prin- 
cipalities, electorates,  ecclesiastical  territories,  and  free  cities, 
became  characteristic  by  the  early  Middle  Ages  and  persisted 
until  1871,  when  the  country  was  finally  united.  This  disunity 
was  exacerbated  by  the  Protestant  Reformation  of  the  sixteenth 
century,  which  ended  Germany's  religious  unity  by  converting 
many  Germans  to  Lutheranism  and  Calvinism.  For  several  cen- 
turies, adherents  to  these  two  varieties  of  Protestantism  viewed 
each  other  with  as  much  hostility  and  suspicion  as  they  did 
Roman  Catholics.  For  their  part,  Catholics  frequently  resorted 
to  force  to  defend  themselves  against  Protestants  or  to  convert 
them.  As  a  result,  Germans  were  divided  not  only  by  territory 
but  also  by  religion. 

The  terrible  destruction  of  the  Thirty  Years'  War  of  1618-48, 
a  war  partially  religious  in  nature,  reduced  German  particular- 
ism, as  did  the  reforms  enacted  during  the  age  of  enlightened 
absolutism  (1648-1789)  and  later  the  growth  of  nationalism 
and  industrialism  in  the  nineteenth  century.  In  1815  the  Con- 
gress of  Vienna  stipulated  that  the  several  hundred  states  exist- 
ing in  Germany  before  the  French  Revolution  be  replaced  with 
thirty-eight  states,  some  of  them  quite  small.  In  subsequent 
decades,  the  two  largest  of  these  states,  Austria  and  Prussia, 
vied  for  primacy  in  a  Germany  that  was  gradually  unifying 
under  a  variety  of  social  and  economic  pressures.  The  politi- 
cian responsible  for  German  unification  was  Otto  von  Bis- 
marck, whose  brilliant  diplomacy  and  ruthless  practice  of 
statecraft  secured  Prussian  hegemony  in  a  united  Germany  in 
1871.  The  new  state,  proclaimed  the  German  Empire,  did  not 
include  Austria  and  its  extensive  empire  of  many  non-German 
territories  and  peoples. 

Imperial  Germany  prospered.  Its  economy  grew  rapidly,  and 
by  the  turn  of  the  century  it  rivaled  Britain's  in  size.  Although 
the  empire's  constitution  did  not  provide  for  a  political  system 
in  which  the  government  was  responsible  to  parliament,  politi- 


4 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 


cal  parties  were  founded  that  represented  the  main  social 
groups.  Roman  Catholic  and  socialist  parties  contended  with 
conservative  and  progressive  parties  and  with  a  conservative 
monarchy  to  determine  how  Germany  should  be  governed. 

After  Bismarck's  dismissal  in  1890  by  the  young  emperor  Wil- 
helm  II,  Germany  stepped  up  its  competition  with  other  Euro- 
pean states  for  colonies  and  for  what  it  considered  its  proper 
place  among  the  great  states.  An  aggressive  program  of  military 
expansion  instilled  fear  of  Germany  in  its  neighbors.  Several 
decades  of  military  and  colonial  competition  and  a  number  of 
diplomatic  crises  made  for  a  tense  international  atmosphere  by 
1914.  In  the  early  summer  of  that  year,  Germany's  rulers  acted 
on  the  belief  that  their  country's  survival  depended  on  a  suc- 
cessful war  against  Russia  and  France.  German  strategists  felt 
that  a  war  against  these  countries  had  to  be  waged  by  1916  if  it 
were  to  be  won  because  after  that  year  Russian  and  French  mil- 
itary reforms  would  be  complete,  making  German  victory 
doubtful.  This  logic  led  Germany  to  get  drawn  into  a  war 
between  its  ally  Austria-Hungary  and  Russia.  Within  weeks,  a 
complicated  system  of  alliances  escalated  that  regional  conflict 
into  World  War  I,  which  ended  with  Germany's  defeat  in 
November  1918. 

The  Weimar  Republic,  established  at  war's  end,  was  the  first 
attempt  to  institute  parliamentary  democracy  in  Germany.  The 
republic  never  enjoyed  the  wholehearted  support  of  many  Ger- 
mans, however,  and  from  the  start  it  was  under  savage  attack 
from  elements  of  the  left  and,  more  important,  from  the  right. 
Moreover,  it  was  burdened  during  its  fifteen-year  existence  with 
serious  economic  problems.  During  the  second  half  of  the 
1920s,  when  foreign  loans  fed  German  prosperity,  parliamen- 
tary politics  functioned  better,  yet  many  of  the  established 
elites  remained  hostile  to  it.  With  the  onset  of  the  Great 
Depression,  parliamentary  politics  became  impossible,  and  the 
government  ruled  by  decree.  Economic  crisis  favored  extremist 
politicians,  and  Adolf  Hitler's  National  Socialist  German  Work- 
ers' Party  became  the  strongest  party  after  the  summer  elec- 
tions of  1932.  In  January  1933,  the  republic's  elected  president, 
Paul  von  Hindenburg,  the  World  War  I  army  commander, 
named  a  government  headed  by  Hitler. 

Within  a  few  months,  Hitler  accomplished  the  "legal  revolu- 
tion" that  removed  his  opponents.  By  1935  his  regime  had 
transformed  Germany  into  a  totalitarian  state.  Hitler  achieved 
notable  economic  and  diplomatic  successes  during  the  first  five 


5 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

years  of  his  rule.  However,  in  September  1939  he  made  a  fatal 
gamble  by  invading  Poland  and  starting  World  War  II.  The 
eventual  defeat  of  Hitler's  Third  Reich  in  1945  occurred  only 
after  the  loss  of  tens  of  millions  of  lives,  many  from  military 
causes,  many  from  sickness  and  starvation,  and  many  from 
what  has  come  to  be  called  the  Holocaust. 

Early  History 

The  Germanic  tribes,  which  probably  originated  from  a  mix- 
ture of  peoples  along  the  Baltic  Sea  coast,  inhabited  the  north- 
ern part  of  the  European  continent  by  about  500  B.C.  By  100 
B.C.,  they  had  advanced  into  the  central  and  southern  areas  of 
present-day  Germany.  At  that  time,  there  were  three  major 
tribal  groups:  the  eastern  Germanic  peoples  lived  along  the 
Oder  and  Vistula  rivers;  the  northern  Germanic  peoples  inhab- 
ited the  southern  part  of  present-day  Scandinavia;  and  the 
western  Germanic  peoples  inhabited  the  extreme  south  of  Jut- 
land and  the  area  between  the  North  Sea  and  the  Elbe,  Rhine, 
and  Main  rivers.  The  Rhine  provided  a  temporary  boundary 
between  Germanic  and  Roman  territory  after  the  defeat  of  the 
Suevian  tribe  by  Julius  Caesar  about  70  B.C.  The  threatening 
presence  of  warlike  tribes  beyond  the  Rhine  prompted  the 
Romans  to  pursue  a  campaign  of  expansion  into  Germanic  ter- 
ritory. However,  the  defeat  of  the  provincial  governor  Varus  by 
Arminius  at  the  Battle  of  the  Teutoburg  Forest  in  A.D.  9  halted 
Roman  expansion;  Arminius  had  learned  the  enemy's  strate- 
gies during  his  military  training  in  the  Roman  armies.  This  bat- 
tle brought  about  the  liberation  of  the  greater  part  of  Germany 
from  Roman  domination.  The  Rhine  River  was  once  again  the 
boundary  line  until  the  Romans  reoccupied  territory  on  its 
eastern  bank  and  built  the  Limes,  a  fortification  300  kilometers 
long,  in  the  first  century  A.D. 

The  second  through  the  sixth  centuries  was  a  period  of 
change  and  destruction  in  which  eastern  and  western  Ger- 
manic tribes  left  their  native  lands  and  settled  in  newly 
acquired  territories.  This  period  of  Germanic  history,  which 
later  supplied  material  for  heroic  epics,  included  the  downfall 
of  the  Roman  Empire  and  resulted  in  a  considerable  expan- 
sion of  habitable  area  for  the  Germanic  peoples.  However,  with 
the  exception  of  those  kingdoms  established  by  Franks  and 
Anglo-Saxons,  Germanic  kingdoms  founded  in  such  other 
parts  of  Europe  as  Italy  and  Spain  were  of  relatively  short  dura- 
tion because  they  were  assimilated  by  the  native  populations.

Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

The  conquest  of  Roman  Gaul  by  Frankish  tribes  in  the  late  fifth 
century  became  a  milestone  of  European  history;  it  was  the 
Franks  who  were  to  become  the  founders  of  a  civilized  German 
state. 

Medieval  Germany 

The  Merovingian  Dynasty,  ca.  500-751 

In  Gaul  a  fusion  of  Roman  and  Germanic  societies  occurred. 
Clovis,  a  Salian  Frank  belonging  to  a  family  supposedly 
descended  from  a  mythical  hero  named  Merovech,  became  the 
absolute  ruler  of  a  Germanic  kingdom  of  mixed  Roman-Ger- 
manic population  in  486.  He  consolidated  his  rule  with  victo- 
ries over  the  Gallo-Romans  and  all  the  Frankish  tribes,  and  his 
successors  made  other  Germanic  tribes  subjects  of  the  Merov- 
ingian Dynasty.  The  remaining  250  years  of  the  dynasty,  how- 
ever, were  marked  by  internecine  struggles  and  a  gradual 
decline.  During  the  period  of  Merovingian  rule,  the  Franks 
reluctantly  began  to  adopt  Christianity  following  the  baptism  of 
Clovis,  an  event  that  inaugurated  the  alliance  between  the 
Frankish  kingdom  and  the  Roman  Catholic  Church.  The  most 
notable  of  the  missionaries  responsible  for  Christianizing  the 
tribes  living  in  Germany  was  Saint  Boniface  (ca.  675-754),  an 
English  missionary  who  is  considered  the  founder  of  German 
Christianity. 

The  Carolingian  Dynasty,  752-911 

Charlemagne  inherited  the  Frankish  crown  in  768.  During 
his  reign  (768-814),  he  subdued  Bavaria,  conquered  Lom- 
bardy  and  Saxony,  and  established  his  authority  in  central  Italy. 
By  the  end  of  the  eighth  century,  his  kingdom,  later  to  become 
known  as  the  First  Reich  (empire  in  German),  included 
present-day  France,  the  Netherlands,  Belgium,  and  Luxem- 
bourg, as  well  as  a  narrow  strip  of  northern  Spain,  much  of 
Germany  and  Austria,  and  much  of  the  northern  half  of  Italy. 
Charlemagne,  founder  of  an  empire  that  was  Roman,  Chris- 
tian, and  Germanic,  was  crowned  emperor  in  Rome  by  the 
pope  in  800. 

The  Carolingian  Empire  was  based  on  an  alliance  between 
the  emperor,  who  was  a  temporal  ruler  supported  by  a  military 
retinue,  and  the  pope  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  who 
granted  spiritual  sanction  to  the  imperial  mission.  Charle- 
magne and  his  son  Louis  I  (r.  814-40)  established  centralized 


7 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

authority,  appointed  imperial  counts  as  administrators,  and 
developed  a  hierarchical  feudal  structure  headed  by  the 
emperor.  Reliant  on  personal  leadership  rather  than  the 
Roman  concept  of  legalistic  government,  Charlemagne's 
empire  lasted  less  than  a  century. 

A  period  of  warfare  followed  the  death  of  Louis.  The  Treaty 
of  Verdun  (843)  restored  peace  and  divided  the  empire  among 
three  sons,  geographically  and  politically  delineating  the 
approximate  future  territories  of  Germany,  France,  and  the 
area  between  them,  known  as  the  Middle  Kingdom  (see  fig.  2). 
The  eastern  Carolingian  kings  ruled  the  East  Frankish  King- 
dom, what  is  now  Germany  and  Austria;  the  western  Caroling- 
ian kings  ruled  the  West  Frankish  Kingdom,  what  became 
France.  The  imperial  title,  however,  came  to  depend  increas- 
ingly on  rule  over  the  Middle  Kingdom.  By  this  time,  in  addi- 
tion to  a  geographical  and  political  delineation,  a  cultural  and 
linguistic  split  had  occurred.  The  eastern  Frankish  tribes  still 
spoke  Germanic  dialects;  the  language  of  the  western  Frankish 
tribes,  under  the  influence  of  Gallo-Latin,  had  developed  into 
Old  French.  Because  of  these  linguistic  differences,  the  Treaty 
of  Verdun  had  to  be  written  in  two  languages. 

Not  only  had  Charlemagne's  empire  been  divided  into  three 
kingdoms,  but  the  East  Frankish  Kingdom  was  being  weakened 
by  the  rise  of  regional  duchies,  the  so-called  stem  duchies  of 
Franconia,  Saxony,  Bavaria,  Swabia,  and  Lorraine,  which 
acquired  the  trappings  of  petty  kingdoms.  The  fragmentation 
in  the  east  marked  the  beginning  of  German  particularism,  in 
which  territorial  rulers  promoted  their  own  interests  and 
autonomy  without  regard  to  the  kingdom  as  a  whole.  The 
duchies  were  strengthened  when  the  Carolingian  line  died  out 
in  911;  subsequent  kings  would  have  no  direct  blood  link  to  the 
throne  with  which  to  legitimate  their  claims  to  power  against 
the  territorial  dukes. 

The  Saxon  Dynasty,  919-1024 

Because  the  dukes  of  the  East  Frankish  Kingdom  had  wea- 
ried of  being  ruled  by  a  foreign  king,  they  elected  a  German  to 
serve  as  their  king  once  the  Carolingian  line  expired.  The  elec- 
tion of  Conrad  I  (r.  911-18),  Duke  of  Franconia,  as  the  first 
German  king  has  been  marked  by  some  historians  as  the  begin- 
ning of  German  history.  Conrad's  successor,  Henry  I  (r.  919- 
36),  Duke  of  Saxony,  was  powerful  enough  to  designate  his  son 
Otto  I  (r.  936-73)  as  his  successor.  Otto  was  so  able  a  ruler  that 


8 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

he  came  to  be  known  as  Otto  the  Great.  He  overpowered  other 
territorial  dukes  who  rebelled  against  his  rule  and  reversed  the 
particularist  trend  for  a  time.  But  he  failed  to  establish  the 
principle  of  hereditary  succession,  and  the  German  dukes  con- 
tinued to  elect  one  of  their  number  as  king.  But  through  mili- 
tary successes  and  alliances  with  the  church,  which  had 
extensive  properties  and  military  forces  of  its  own,  Otto 
expanded  the  crown  lands,  thus  laying  the  foundation  of 
monarchical  power.  Henry,  Otto,  and  the  later  Saxon  kings 
also  encouraged  eastward  expansion  and  colonization,  thereby 
extending  German  rule  to  parts  of  the  Slavic  territories  of 
Poland  and  Bohemia.  The  Magyars'  westward  expansion  was 
halted  by  Otto  in  955  at  the  Battle  of  Lechfeld  in  southern  Ger- 
many. 

In  962  Otto,  who  had  also  gained  control  of  the  Middle 
Kingdom,  was  formally  crowned  king  of  the  Romans.  The  pos- 
sessor of  this  title  would,  in  time,  be  known  as  the  Holy  Roman 
Emperor.  The  coronation  came  to  be  seen  as  the  founding  of 
the  Holy  Roman  Empire,  an  institution  that  lasted  until  1806 
and  profoundly  influenced  the  course  of  German  history.  The 
coronation  of  Otto  was  a  moment  of  glory  for  the  German 
monarchy,  but  its  long-term  consequences  were  not  beneficial 
because  as  German  kings  sought  to  exercise  the  offices  of  the 
empire  they  became  involved  in  Italian  affairs,  often  to  such  an 
extent  that  they  neglected  the  governing  of  Germany.  Because 
German  kings  were  so  often  in  Italy,  the  German  nobility 
became  stronger.  In  addition,  the  presence  of  German  kings  in 
Italy  as  emperors  soon  caused  them  to  come  into  conflict  with 
the  papacy,  which  did  not  hesitate  to  seek  allies  in  Italy  or  Ger- 
many to  limit  imperial  power.  A  last  problem  was  that  the  suc- 
cession to  the  German  throne  was  often  uncertain  or  was  hotly 
contested  because  it  was  not  inheritable,  but  could  only  be 
attained  through  election  by  the  German  dukes.  This  circum- 
stance made  the  formation  of  an  orderly  or  stable  central  gov- 
ernment nearly  impossible.  In  the  opinion  of  some  historians, 
Otto's  triumph  in  Rome  in  962  ultimately  was  disastrous  for 
Germany  because  it  delayed  German  unification  by  centuries. 

The  Salian  Dynasty,  1024-1125 

After  the  death  of  the  last  Saxon  king  in  1024,  the  crown 
passed  to  the  Salians,  a  Frankish  tribe.  The  four  Salian  kings — 
Conrad  II,  Henry  III,  Henry  IV,  and  Henry  V — who  ruled  Ger- 
many as  kings  from  1024  to  1125,  established  their  monarchy

as  a  major  European  power.  Their  main  accomplishment  was 
the  development  of  a  permanent  administrative  system  based 
on  a  class  of  public  officials  answerable  to  the  crown. 

A  principal  reason  for  the  success  of  the  early  Salians  was 
their  alliance  with  the  church,  a  policy  begun  by  Otto  I,  which 
gave  them  the  material  support  they  needed  to  subdue  rebel- 
lious dukes.  In  time,  however,  the  church  came  to  regret  this 
close  relationship.  The  relationship  broke  down  in  1075  during 
what  came  to  be  known  as  the  Investiture  Contest,  a  struggle  in 
which  the  reformist  pope,  Gregory  VII,  demanded  that  Henry 
IV  (r.  1056-1106)  renounce  his  rights  over  the  German 
church.  The  pope  also  attacked  the  concept  of  monarchy  by 
divine  right  and  gained  the  support  of  significant  elements  of 
the  German  nobility  interested  in  limiting  imperial  absolutism. 
More  important,  the  pope  forbade  church  officials  under  pain 
of  excommunication  to  support  Henry  as  they  had  so  freely

done  in  the  past.  In  the  end,  Henry  journeyed  to  Canossa  in 
northern  Italy  in  1077  to  do  penance  and  to  receive  absolution 
from  the  pope.  However,  he  resumed  the  practice  of  lay  investi- 
ture (appointment  of  religious  officials  by  civil  authorities)  and 
arranged  the  election  of  an  antipope. 

The  German  monarch's  struggle  with  the  papacy  resulted  in 
a  war  that  ravaged  German  lands  from  1077  until  the  Concor- 
dat of  Worms  in  1122.  This  agreement  stipulated  that  the  pope 
was  to  appoint  high  church  officials  but  gave  the  German  king 
the  right  to  veto  the  papal  choices.  Imperial  control  of  Italy  was 
lost  for  a  time,  and  the  imperial  crown  became  dependent  on 
the  political  support  of  competing  aristocratic  factions.  Feudal- 
ism also  became  more  widespread  as  freemen  sought  protec- 
tion by  swearing  allegiance  to  a  lord.  These  powerful  local 
rulers,  having  thereby  acquired  extensive  territories  and  large 
military  retinues,  took  over  administration  within  their  territo- 
ries and  organized  it  around  an  increasing  number  of  castles. 
The  most  powerful  of  these  local  rulers  came  to  be  called 
princes  rather  than  dukes. 

According  to  the  laws  of  the  German  feudal  system,  the  king 
had  no  claims  on  the  vassals  of  the  other  princes,  only  on  those 
living  within  his  family's  territory.  Lacking  the  support  of  the 
formerly  independent  vassals  and  weakened  by  the  increasing 
hostility  of  the  church,  the  monarchy  lost  its  preeminence. 
Thus,  the  Investiture  Contest  strengthened  local  power  in  Ger- 
many in  contrast  to  what  was  happening  in  France  and 
England,  where  the  growth  of  a  centralized  royal  power  was 
under  way. 

The  Investiture  Contest  had  an  additional  effect.  The  long 
struggle  between  emperor  and  pope  hurt  Germany's  intellec- 
tual life — in  this  period  largely  confined  to  monasteries — and 
Germany  no  longer  led  or  even  kept  pace  with  developments 
occurring  in  France  and  Italy.  For  instance,  no  universities 
were  founded  in  Germany  until  the  fourteenth  century. 

The  Hohenstaufen  Dynasty,  1138-1254 

Following  the  death  of  Henry  V  (r.  1106-25),  the  last  of  the 
Salian  kings,  the  dukes  refused  to  elect  his  nephew  because 
they  feared  that  he  might  restore  royal  power.  Instead,  they 
elected  a  noble  connected  to  the  Saxon  noble  family  Welf 
(often  written  as  Guelf).  This  choice  inflamed  the  Hohen- 
staufen family  of  Swabia,  which  also  had  a  claim  to  the  throne. 
Although  a  Hohenstaufen  became  king  in  1138,  the  dynastic 


11 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

feud  with  the  Welfs  continued.  The  feud  became  international 
in  nature  when  the  Welfs  sided  with  the  papacy  and  its  allies, 
most  notably  the  cities  of  northern  Italy,  against  the  imperial 
ambitions  of  the  Hohenstaufen  Dynasty. 

The  second  of  the  Hohenstaufen  rulers,  Frederick  I  (r. 
1152-90),  also  known  as  Frederick  Barbarossa  because  of  his 
red  beard,  struggled  throughout  his  reign  to  restore  the  power 
and  prestige  of  the  German  monarchy,  but  he  had  little  suc- 
cess. Because  the  German  dukes  had  grown  stronger  both  dur- 
ing and  after  the  Investiture  Contest  and  because  royal  access 
to  the  resources  of  the  church  in  Germany  was  much  reduced, 
Frederick  was  forced  to  go  to  Italy  to  find  the  finances  needed 
to  restore  the  king's  power  in  Germany.  He  was  soon  crowned 
emperor  in  Italy,  but  decades  of  warfare  on  the  peninsula 
yielded  scant  results.  The  papacy  and  the  prosperous  city-states 
of  northern  Italy  were  traditional  enemies,  but  the  fear  of 
imperial  domination  caused  them  to  join  ranks  to  fight  Freder- 
ick. Under  the  skilled  leadership  of  Pope  Alexander  III,  the 
alliance  suffered  many  defeats  but  ultimately  was  able  to  deny 
the  emperor  a  complete  victory  in  Italy.  Frederick  returned  to 
Germany  old  and  embittered.  He  had  vanquished  one  notable 
opponent  and  member  of  the  Welf  family,  Saxony's  Henry  the 
Lion,  but  his  hopes  of  restoring  the  power  and  prestige  of  his 
family  and  the  monarchy  seemed  unlikely  to  be  met  by  the  end 
of  his  life. 

During  Frederick's  long  stays  in  Italy,  the  German  princes 
became  stronger  and  began  a  successful  colonization  of  Slavic 
lands.  Offers  of  reduced  taxes  and  manorial  duties  enticed 
many  Germans  to  settle  in  the  east  as  the  area's  original  inhab- 
itants were  killed  or  driven  away.  Because  of  this  colonization, 
the  empire  increased  in  size  and  came  to  include  Pomerania, 
Silesia,  Bohemia,  and  Moravia.  A  quickening  economic  life  in 
Germany  increased  the  number  of  towns  and  gave  them 
greater  importance.  It  was  also  during  this  period  that  castles 
and  courts  replaced  monasteries  as  centers  of  culture.  Growing 
out  of  this  courtly  culture,  German  medieval  literature  reached 
its  peak  in  lyrical  love  poetry,  the  Minnesang,  and  in  narrative 
epic  poems  such  as  Tristan,  Parzival,  and  the  Nibelungenlied. 

Frederick  died  in  1190  while  on  a  crusade  and  was  suc- 
ceeded by  his  son,  Henry  VI  (r.  1190-97).  Elected  king  even 
before  his  father's  death,  Henry  went  to  Rome  to  be  crowned 
emperor.  A  death  in  his  wife's  family  gave  him  possession  of  Sic- 
ily, a  source  of  vast  wealth.  Henry  failed  to  make  royal  and 


12 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

imperial  succession  hereditary,  but  in  1196  he  succeeded  in 
gaining  a  pledge  that  his  infant  son  Frederick  would  receive 
the  German  crown.  Faced  with  difficulties  in  Italy  and  confi- 
dent that  he  would  realize  his  wishes  in  Germany  at  a  later 
date,  Henry  returned  to  the  south,  where  it  appeared  he  might 
unify  the  peninsula  under  the  Hohenstaufen  name.  After  a 
series  of  military  victories,  however,  he  died  of  natural  causes  in 
Sicily  in  1197. 

Because  the  election  of  the  three-year-old  Frederick  to  be 
German  king  appeared  likely  to  make  orderly  rule  difficult,  the 
boy's  uncle,  Philip,  was  chosen  to  serve  in  his  place.  Other  fac- 
tions elected  a  Welf  candidate,  Otto  IV,  as  counterking,  and  a 
long  civil  war  began.  Philip  was  murdered  by  Otto  IV  in  1208. 
Otto  IV  in  turn  was  killed  by  the  French  at  the  Battle  of  Bou- 
vines  in  1214.  Frederick  returned  to  Germany  in  1212  from  Sic- 
ily, where  he  had  grown  up,  and  became  king  in  1215.  As 
Frederick  II  (r.  1215-50),  he  spent  little  time  in  Germany 
because  his  main  concerns  lay  in  Italy.  Frederick  made  signifi- 
cant concessions  to  the  German  nobles,  such  as  those  put  forth 
in  an  imperial  statute  of  1232,  which  made  princes  virtually 
independent  rulers  within  their  territories.  The  clergy  also 
became  more  powerful.  Although  Frederick  was  one  of  the 
most  energetic,  imaginative,  and  capable  rulers  of  the  Middle 
Ages,  he  did  nothing  to  draw  the  disparate  forces  in  Germany 
together.  His  legacy  was  thus  that  local  rulers  had  more  author- 
ity after  his  reign  than  before  it. 

By  the  time  of  Frederick's  death  in  1250,  there  was  little  cen- 
tralized power  in  Germany.  The  Great  Interregnum  (1256-73), 
a  period  of  anarchy  in  which  there  was  no  emperor  and  Ger- 
man princes  vied  for  individual  advantage,  followed  the  death 
of  Frederick's  son  Conrad  IV  in  1254.  In  this  short  period,  the 
German  nobility  managed  to  strip  many  powers  away  from  the 
already  diminished  monarchy.  Rather  than  establish  sovereign 
states,  however,  many  nobles  tended  to  look  after  their  families. 
Their  many  heirs  created  more  and  smaller  estates.  A  largely 
free  class  of  officials  also  formed,  many  of  whom  eventually 
acquired  hereditary  rights  to  administrative  and  legal  offices. 
These  trends  compounded  political  fragmentation  within  Ger- 
many. 

Despite  the  political  chaos  of  the  Hohenstaufen  period,  the 
population  grew  from  an  estimated  8  million  in  1200  to  about 
14  million  in  1300,  and  the  number  of  towns  increased  tenfold. 
The  most  heavily  urbanized  areas  of  Germany  were  located  in 


13 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  south  and  the  west.  Towns  often  developed  a  degree  of 
independence,  but  many  were  subordinate  to  local  rulers  or 
the  emperor.  Colonization  of  the  east  also  continued  in  the 
thirteenth  century,  most  notably  through  the  efforts  of  the 
Knights  of  the  Teutonic  Order,  a  society  of  soldier-monks.  Ger- 
man merchants  also  began  trading  extensively  on  the  Baltic. 

The  Empire  under  the  Early  Habsburgs 

The  Great  Interregnum  ended  in  1273  with  the  election  of 
Rudolf  of  Habsburg  as  king-emperor.  After  the  interregnum 
period,  Germany's  emperors  came  from  three  powerful  dynas- 
tic houses:  Luxemburg  (in  Bohemia),  Wittelsbach  (in  Bavaria), 
and  Habsburg  (in  Austria).  These  families  alternated  on  the 
imperial  throne  until  the  crown  returned  in  the  mid-fifteenth 
century  to  the  Habsburgs,  who  retained  it  with  only  one  short 
break  until  the  dissolution  of  the  Holy  Roman  Empire  in  1806. 

The  Golden  Bull  of  1356,  an  edict  promulgated  by  Emperor 
Charles  IV  (r.  1355-78)  of  the  Luxemburg  family,  provided  the 
basic  constitution  of  the  empire  up  to  its  dissolution.  It  formal- 
ized the  practice  of  having  seven  electors — the  archbishops  of 
the  cities  of  Trier,  Cologne,  and  Mainz,  and  the  rulers  of  the 
Palatinate,  Saxony,  Brandenburg,  and  Bohemia — choose  the 
emperor,  and  it  represented  a  further  political  consolidation  of 
the  principalities.  The  Golden  Bull  ended  the  long-standing 
attempt  of  various  emperors  to  unite  Germany  under  a  heredi- 
tary monarchy.  Henceforth,  the  emperor  shared  power  with 
other  great  nobles  like  himself  and  was  regarded  as  merely  the 
first  among  equals.  Without  the  cooperation  of  the  other 
princes,  he  could  not  rule. 

The  princes  were  not  absolute  rulers  either.  They  had  made 
so  many  concessions  to  other  secular  and  ecclesiastical  powers 
in  their  struggle  against  the  emperor  that  many  smaller  princi- 
palities, ecclesiastical  states,  and  towns  had  retained  a  degree  of 
independence.  Some  of  the  smaller  noble  holdings  were  so 
poor  that  they  had  to  resort  to  outright  extortion  of  travelers 
and  merchants  to  sustain  themselves,  with  the  result  that  jour- 
neying through  Germany  could  be  perilous  in  the  late  Middle 
Ages.  All  of  Germany  was  under  the  nominal  control  of  the 
emperor,  but  because  his  power  was  so  weak  or  uncertain,  local 
authorities  had  to  maintain  order — yet  another  indication  of 
Germany's  political  fragmentation. 

Despite  the  lack  of  a  strong  central  authority,  Germany  pros- 
pered during  the  fourteenth  and  fifteenth  centuries.  Its  popu- 


14 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

lation  increased  from  about  14  million  in  1300  to  about  16 
million  in  1500,  even  though  the  Black  Death  killed  as  much  as 
one-third  of  the  population  in  the  mid-fourteenth  century. 

Located  in  the  center  of  Europe,  Germany  was  active  in 
international  trade.  Rivers  flowing  to  the  north  and  the  east 
and  the  Alpine  passes  made  Germany  a  natural  conduit  convey- 
ing goods  from  the  Mediterranean  to  northern  Europe.  Ger- 
many became  a  noted  manufacturing  center.  Trade  and 
manufacturing  led  to  the  growth  of  towns,  and  in  1500  an  esti- 
mated 10  percent  of  the  population  lived  in  urban  areas.  Many 
towns  became  wealthy  and  were  governed  by  a  sophisticated 
and  self-confident  merchant  oligarchy.  Dozens  of  towns  in 
northern  Germany  joined  together  to  form  the  Hanseatic 
League,  a  trading  federation  that  managed  shipping  and  trade 
on  the  Baltic  and  in  many  inland  areas,  even  into  Bohemia  and 
Hungary.  The  Hanseatic  League  had  commercial  offices  in 
such  widely  dispersed  towns  as  London,  Bergen  (in  present-day 
Norway),  and  Novgorod  (in  present-day  Russia).  The  league 
was  at  one  time  so  powerful  that  it  successfully  waged  war 
against  the  king  of  Denmark.  In  southern  Germany,  towns 
banded  together  on  occasion  to  protect  their  interests  against 
encroachments  by  either  imperial  or  local  powers.  Although 
these  urban  confederations  were  not  always  strong  enough  to 
defeat  their  opponents,  they  sometimes  succeeded  in  helping 
their  members  to  avoid  complete  subjugation.  In  what  was 
eventually  to  become  Switzerland,  one  confederation  of  towns 
had  sufficient  military  might  to  win  virtual  independence  from 
the  Holy  Roman  Empire  in  1499. 

The  Knights  of  the  Teutonic  Order  continued  their  settle- 
ment of  the  east  until  their  dissolution  early  in  the  sixteenth 
century,  in  spite  of  a  serious  defeat  at  the  hands  of  the  Poles  at 
the  Battle  of  Tannenberg  in  1410.  The  lands  that  came  under 
the  control  of  this  monastic  military,  whose  members  were 
pledged  to  chastity  and  to  the  conquest  and  conversion  of  hea- 
thens, included  territory  that  one  day  would  become  eastern 
Prussia  and  would  be  inhabited  by  Germans  until  1945.  Ger- 
man settlement  in  areas  south  of  the  territories  controlled  by 
the  Knights  of  the  Teutonic  Order  also  continued,  but  gener- 
ally at  the  behest  of  eastern  rulers  who  valued  the  skills  of  Ger- 
man peasant-farmers.  These  new  settlers  were  part  of  a  long 
process  of  peaceful  German  immigration  to  the  east  that  lasted 
for  centuries,  with  Germans  moving  into  all  of  eastern  Europe 
and  even  deep  into  Russia.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Intellectual  growth  accompanied  German  expansion.  Sev- 
eral universities  were  founded,  and  Germany  came  into 
increased  contact  with  the  humanists  active  elsewhere  in 
Europe.  The  invention  of  movable  type  in  the  middle  of  the  fif- 
teenth century  in  Germany  also  contributed  to  a  more  lively 
intellectual  climate.  Religious  ferment  was  common,  most 
notably  the  heretical  movement  engendered  by  the  teachings 
of  Jan  Hus  (ca.  1372-1415)  in  Bohemia.  Hus  eventually  was 
executed,  but  the  dissatisfaction  he  felt  toward  the  established 
church  was  shared  by  many  others  throughout  German-speak- 
ing lands,  as  could  be  seen  in  the  frequent  occurrences  of  pop- 
ular, mystical  religious  revivalism  after  his  death. 

The  Protestant  Reformation 

On  the  eve  of  the  Protestant  Reformation,  the  institutions  of 
the  Holy  Roman  Empire  were  widely  thought  to  be  in  need  of 
improvement.  The  Habsburg  emperors  Frederick  III  (r.  1440- 
93)  and  his  son  Maximilian  I  (r.  1493-1519)  both  cooperated 
with  individual  local  rulers  to  enact  changes.  However,  the 
imperial  and  local  parties  had  different  aims,  the  former  wish- 
ing to  strengthen  the  empire,  the  latter  aiming  to  secure 
greater  independence  by  formalizing  their  rights  and  ensuring 
regular  procedures  for  the  conduct  of  public  business.  In  1489 
the  procedures  of  the  imperial  diet,  the  Reichstag,  in  which 
representatives  of  all  states  within  the  empire  met,  were  reorga- 
nized. One  of  the  reforms  allowed  participation  in  the  diet  by 
representatives  of  the  towns.  In  1495  Maximilian  declared  an 
empirewide  peace  and  made  arrangements  to  reduce  the  law- 
lessness and  violence  that  often  marked  relations  among  local 
rulers. 

Maximilian's  reforms  were  not  enough  to  cure  the  ills  of  the 
empire,  and  relations  between  it  and  the  princes  and  ecclesias- 
tical states  often  were  tense.  Disputes  frequently  involved  com- 
plicated constellations  of  powers  with  occasional  interference 
from  abroad,  most  notably  France.  Charles  V  (r.  1519-56)  was 
elected  emperor  in  1519  only  after  he  paid  large  bribes  to  the 
seven  electors  and  agreed  to  many  restrictions  on  his  powers, 
restrictions  he  often  later  ignored  (see  fig.  3). 

A  changing  economy  also  made  for  discontent  among  those 
unable  to  profit  from  new  conditions.  Some  of  the  empire's 
inhabitants  had  become  quite  rich,  most  notably  the  Fugger 
family  of  Augsburg,  whose  members  had  replaced  the  bankers 
of  northern  Italy  as  Europe's  leading  financiers.  The  Fuggers

had  come  to  manage  the  financial  affairs  of  the  Habsburg 
Dynasty,  which,  in  combination  with  increased  trade  between 
south  and  north,  made  Germany  Europe's  financial  center  for 
a  few  decades.  However,  other  groups  in  Germany  were  experi- 
encing hardship.  A  burgeoning  rural  population  found  it  diffi- 
cult to  get  enough  to  eat,  and  many  peasants  went  to  the  towns 
to  seek  a  living.  Municipal  officials  responded  by  seeking  to  bar 
rural  newcomers.  Within  towns  that  were  not  prospering,  rela- 
tions between  the  classes  became  more  tense  as  social  mobility 
was  reduced  by  a  declining  economy. 

Martin  Luther 

On  the  eve  of  All  Saints'  Day  in  1517,  Martin  Luther,  a  pro- 
fessor of  theology  at  Wittenberg  University  in  Saxony,  posted 
ninety-five  theses  on  a  church  door.  Luther's  primary  concern 
was  the  sale  of  indulgences — papal  grants  of  reduced  punish- 
ment in  the  afterlife,  including  releases  from  purgatory.  First 
written  in  Latin,  the  theses  were  soon  translated  into  German 
and  widely  distributed.  Summoned  by  church  authorities  to 
explain  his  writings,  Luther  became  embroiled  in  further  con- 
troversy and  in  1520  wrote  his  three  most  famous  tracts,  in 
which  he  attacked  the  papacy  and  exposed  church  corruption, 
acknowledged  the  validity  of  only  two  of  the  seven  sacraments, 
and  argued  for  the  supremacy  of  faith  over  good  works.  In 
1521  Luther  was  summoned  to  appear  before  Emperor  Charles 
V  at  the  Diet  of  Worms.  Refusing  to  recant  his  writings,  he  was 
banned  under  the  Edict  of  Worms.  Secreted  away  by  the  ruler 
of  Saxony,  Frederick  the  Wise,  Luther  retreated  to  the  castle  of 
Wartburg,  where  he  worked  on  a  translation  of  the  New  Testa- 
ment and  wrote  numerous  religious  tracts. 

Luther's  disagreements  with  the  doctrines  of  the  Roman 
Catholic  Church  set  off  a  chain  of  events  that  within  a  few 
decades  destroyed  Germany's  religious  unity.  Although  one  of 
the  most  influential  figures  in  German  history,  Luther  was  only 
one  of  many  who  were  critical  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church. 
However,  because  of  the  power  of  his  ideas  and  the  enormous 
influence  of  his  writings,  it  is  he  who  is  regarded  as  the  initiator 
of  the  Protestant  Reformation.  Luther  quickly  acquired  a  large 
following  among  those  disgusted  by  rampant  church  corrup- 
tion and  unfulfilled  by  mechanistic  religious  services.  Many 
warmed  to  his  contention  that  religion  must  be  simplified  into 
a  close  relationship  of  human  beings  with  God  without  the

had  come  to  manage  the  financial  affairs  of  the  Habsburg 
Dynasty,  which,  in  combination  with  increased  trade  between 
south  and  north,  made  Germany  Europe's  financial  center  for 
a  few  decades.  However,  other  groups  in  Germany  were  experi- 
encing hardship.  A  burgeoning  rural  population  found  it  diffi- 
cult to  get  enough  to  eat,  and  many  peasants  went  to  the  towns 
to  seek  a  living.  Municipal  officials  responded  by  seeking  to  bar 
rural  newcomers.  Within  towns  that  were  not  prospering,  rela- 
tions between  the  classes  became  more  tense  as  social  mobility 
was  reduced  by  a  declining  economy. 

Martin  Luther 

On  the  eve  of  All  Saints'  Day  in  1517,  Martin  Luther,  a  pro- 
fessor of  theology  at  Wittenberg  University  in  Saxony,  posted 
ninety-five  theses  on  a  church  door.  Luther's  primary  concern 
was  the  sale  of  indulgences — papal  grants  of  reduced  punish- 
ment in  the  afterlife,  including  releases  from  purgatory.  First 
written  in  Latin,  the  theses  were  soon  translated  into  German 
and  widely  distributed.  Summoned  by  church  authorities  to 
explain  his  writings,  Luther  became  embroiled  in  further  con- 
troversy and  in  1520  wrote  his  three  most  famous  tracts,  in 
which  he  attacked  the  papacy  and  exposed  church  corruption, 
acknowledged  the  validity  of  only  two  of  the  seven  sacraments, 
and  argued  for  the  supremacy  of  faith  over  good  works.  In 
1521  Luther  was  summoned  to  appear  before  Emperor  Charles 
V  at  the  Diet  of  Worms.  Refusing  to  recant  his  writings,  he  was 
banned  under  the  Edict  of  Worms.  Secreted  away  by  the  ruler 
of  Saxony,  Frederick  the  Wise,  Luther  retreated  to  the  castle  of 
Wartburg,  where  he  worked  on  a  translation  of  the  New  Testa- 
ment and  wrote  numerous  religious  tracts. 

Luther's  disagreements  with  the  doctrines  of  the  Roman 
Catholic  Church  set  off  a  chain  of  events  that  within  a  few 
decades  destroyed  Germany's  religious  unity.  Although  one  of 
the  most  influential  figures  in  German  history,  Luther  was  only 
one  of  many  who  were  critical  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church. 
However,  because  of  the  power  of  his  ideas  and  the  enormous 
influence  of  his  writings,  it  is  he  who  is  regarded  as  the  initiator 
of  the  Protestant  Reformation.  Luther  quickly  acquired  a  large 
following  among  those  disgusted  by  rampant  church  corrup- 
tion and  unfulfilled  by  mechanistic  religious  services.  Many 
warmed  to  his  contention  that  religion  must  be  simplified  into 
a  close  relationship  of  human  beings  with  God  without  the 


19

extensive  mediation  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  and  its 
accretion  of  tradition. 

Luther  magnified  the  inherent  potency  of  his  ideas  by  articu- 
lating them  in  a  language  that  was  without  rival  in  clarity  and 
force.  He  strove  to  make  the  Scriptures  accessible  to  ordinary 
worshipers  by  translating  them  into  vernacular  German.  This 
he  did  with  such  genius  that  the  German  dialect  he  used 
became  the  written  language  of  all  of  Germany.  Without 
Luther's  translation  of  the  Bible,  Germany  might  have  come  to 
use  a  number  of  mutually  incomprehensible  languages,  as  was 
the  case  in  the  northwestern  part  of  the  Holy  Roman  Empire, 
where  local  dialects  evolved  into  what  is  now  modern  Dutch. 
Luther  also  wrote  hymns  that  are  still  sung  in  Christian  reli- 
gious services  all  over  the  world. 

A  less  exalted  reason  for  the  wide  distribution  of  Luther's 
doctrines  was  the  development  of  printing  with  movable  type. 
The  Reformation  created  a  demand  for  all  kinds  of  religious 
writings.  The  readership  was  so  great  that  the  number  of  books 
printed  in  Germany  increased  from  about  150  in  1518  to 
nearly  1,000  six  years  later. 

Luther's  ideas  soon  coalesced  into  a  body  of  doctrines  called 
Lutheranism.  Powerful  supporters  such  as  princes  and  free  cit- 
ies accepted  Lutheranism  for  many  reasons,  some  because  they 
sincerely  supported  reform,  others  out  of  narrow  self-interest. 
In  some  areas,  a  jurisdiction  would  adopt  Lutheranism  because 
a  large  neighboring  state  had  done  so.  In  other  areas,  rulers 
accepted  it  because  they  sought  to  retain  control  over  their 
subjects  who  had  embraced  it  earlier.  Nearly  all  the  imperial 
cities  became  Lutheran,  despite  the  fact  that  the  emperor,  to 
whom  they  were  subordinate,  was  hostile  to  the  movement. 
Historians  have  found  no  single  convincing  explanation  of  why 
one  area  became  Lutheran  and  another  did  not,  because  so 
many  social,  economic,  and  religious  factors  were  involved. 

Given  the  revolutionary  nature  of  Lutheranism  and  the  eco- 
nomic and  political  tensions  of  the  period,  it  is  not  surprising 
that  the  Reformation  soon  became  marked  by  violence  and 
extremism.  The  Knights'  War  of  1522-23,  in  which  members  of 
the  lower  nobility  rebelled  against  the  authorities  in  southwest- 
ern Germany,  was  quickly  crushed.  Some  of  the  rampaging 
knights  were  ardent  supporters  of  Luther.  The  Peasants'  War  of 
1524-25  was  more  serious,  involving  as  many  as  300,000  peas- 
ants in  southwestern  and  central  Germany.  Influenced  some- 
what by  the  new  religious  ideas  but  responding  mostly  to 


20 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 


changing  economic  conditions,  the  peasants'  rebellion  spread 
quickly,  but  without  coordination.  It  also  received  support 
from  some  dissatisfied  city  dwellers  and  from  some  noblemen 
of  arms  who  led  its  ragged  armies.  Although  the  peasants' 
rebellion  was  the  largest  uprising  in  German  history,  it  was 
quickly  suppressed,  with  about  100,000  casualties.  In  the  1530s, 
the  Anabaptists,  a  radical  Christian  sect,  seized  several  towns, 
their  objective  being  to  construct  a  just  society.  They  were  like- 
wise brutally  suppressed  by  the  authorities. 

Luther  opposed  the  peasants'  cause  and  wrote  an  impas- 
sioned tract  demanding  their  quick  suppression.  However  radi- 
cal his  religious  views,  Luther  was  a  social  and  political 
conservative.  He  believed  that  the  end  of  the  world  was  immi- 
nent and  regarded  practical  affairs  as  having  little  importance 
compared  with  the  effort  to  win  eternal  salvation.  Therefore, 
he  counseled  obedience  to  worldly  authorities  if  they  allowed 
freedom  of  worship.  Lutheranism  thus  became  a  means  of 
upholding  the  worldly  status  quo  and  the  leaders  who  adopted 
the  new  faith.  In  contrast  to  England,  where  Protestantism 
retained  a  significant  radical  social  element,  German  Protes- 
tantism became  an  integral  part  of  the  state.  Some  historians 
maintain  that  this  integration  of  state  and  church  has  deprived 
Germany  of  a  deeply  rooted  tradition  of  political  dissent  as 
found  in  Britain  and  the  United  States. 

Resistance  to  Lutheranism 

Although  Lutheranism  had  powerful  supporters,  its  survival 
was  by  no  means  certain.  Its  main  opponent  was  the  Habsburg 
emperor  Charles  V,  who  had  inherited  Spain,  the  Netherlands, 
southern  Italy,  Sicily,  and  the  Austrian  lands  as  patrimony  and 
who  hoped  to  restore  the  unity  of  the  German  Empire  by  keep- 
ing it  Roman  Catholic.  Charles  had  been  out  of  Germany 
between  1521  and  1530,  and  when  he  returned  he  found  that 
the  new  religion  had  won  too  many  adherents  to  be  easily 
uprooted.  In  addition,  he  could  not  devote  himself  single- 
mindedly  to  combating  it  but  also  had  to  struggle  with  power- 
ful external  enemies.  One  was  Francis  I  (r.  1515-47)  of  France, 
who  attacked  the  empire  from  the  west,  having  resolved  to 
destroy  the  power  of  the  Habsburgs.  Another  threat  was  posed 
by  the  Turks,  who  were  attacking  the  empire  from  the  east. 
Even  the  papacy  at  times  conspired  against  its  coreligionist 
because  it  feared  Charles  was  becoming  too  powerful. 


21 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Within  Germany,  forces  were  also  arrayed  against  Charles.  In 
1531  Protestant  leaders  created  the  League  of  Schmalkalden  to 
oppose  him.  By  1545  northeastern  and  northwestern  Germany 
and  large  parts  of  southern  Germany  had  become  Protestant. 
Despite  the  significant  victory  over  the  Protestants  at  the  Battle 
of  Muhlberg  in  1547,  Charles  still  was  not  powerful  enough  to 
impose  his  will  on  the  German  princes. 

The  Peace  of  Augsburg 

By  the  early  1550s,  it  was  apparent  that  a  negotiated  settle- 
ment was  necessary.  In  1555  the  Peace  of  Augsburg  was 
signed. The  settlement,  which  represented  a  victory  for  the 
princes,  granted  recognition  to  both  Lutheranism  and  Roman 
Catholicism  in  Germany,  and  each  ruler  gained  the  right  to 
decide  the  religion  to  be  practiced  within  his  state.  Subjects  not 
of  this  faith  could  move  to  another  state  with  their  property, 
and  disputes  between  the  religions  were  to  be  settled  in  court. 

The  Protestant  Reformation  strengthened  the  long-standing 
trend  toward  particularism  in  Germany.  German  leaders, 
whether  Protestant  or  Catholic,  became  yet  more  powerful  at 
the  expense  of  the  central  governing  institution,  the  empire. 
Protestant  leaders  gained  by  receiving  lands  that  formerly 
belonged  to  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  although  not  to  as 
great  an  extent  as,  for  example,  would  occur  in  England.  Each 
prince  also  became  the  head  of  the  established  church  within 
his  territory.  Catholic  leaders  benefited  because  the  Roman 
Catholic  Church,  in  order  to  help  them  withstand  Protestant- 
ism, gave  them  greater  access  to  church  resources  within  their 
territories.  Germany  was  also  less  united  than  before  because 
Germans  were  no  longer  of  one  faith,  a  situation  officially  rec- 
ognized by  the  Peace  of  Augsburg.  The  agreement  did  not 
bring  sectarian  peace,  however,  because  the  religious  question 
in  Germany  had  not  yet  been  settled  fully. 

The  Thirty  Years'  War,  1 61 8-48 

Germany  enjoyed  a  time  of  relative  quiet  between  the  Peace 
of  Augsburg,  signed  in  1555,  and  the  outbreak  of  the  Thirty 
Years'  War  in  1618.  The  empire  functioned  in  a  more  regular 
way  than  previously,  and  its  federal  nature  was  more  evident 
than  in  the  past.  The  Reichstag  met  frequently  to  deal  with 
public  matters,  and  the  emperors  Ferdinand  I  (r.  1556-64)  and 
Maximilian  II  (r.  1564-76)  were  cautious  rulers  concerned 


22 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 


mostly  with  strengthening  their  family's  hold  on  Austria  and 
adjacent  areas.  Rudolf  II  (r.  1576-1612)  was  an  indolent  and 
capricious  ruler  who  generally  followed  his  advisers'  counsel. 
As  a  result,  some  German  states  were  able  to  expand  their  terri- 
tories by  annexing  smaller  neighbors  in  the  absence  of  an 
engaged  and  attentive  emperor.  Local  rivalries  engendered 
tensions  that  often  were  based  on  religious  affiliation. 

The  Counter-Reformation  and  Religious  Tensions 

The  Peace  of  Augsburg  brought  peace  but  did  not  settle  the 
religious  disagreements  in  Germany.  For  one  thing,  its  signato- 
ries did  not  recognize  Calvinism,  a  relatively  stringent  form  of 
Protestantism  that  was  gaining  prominence  around  the  time 
the  Augsburg  treaty  was  signed,  in  what  has  been  called  the 
Second  Reformation.  Adherents  to  both  Calvinism  and  Luthe- 
ranism  worked  to  spread  their  influence  and  gain  converts  in 
the  face  of  the  Counter-Reformation,  the  attempt  of  the 
Roman  Catholic  Church  to  regroup  and  reverse  the  spread  of 
Protestantism.  Followers  of  all  three  religions  were  at  times  suc- 
cessful, but  only  at  the  expense  of  the  others. 

Fear  of  religious  subversion  caused  rulers  to  monitor  the 
conduct  of  their  subjects  more  closely.  Attempting  to  help  the 
modern  reader  understand  the  intensity  and  pervasiveness  of 
this  fear,  Mary  Fulbrook,  a  noted  British  historian  of  Germany, 
has  likened  it  to  the  anxiety  prevailing  in  the  first  years  of  the 
Cold  War.  An  example  of  the  social  paranoia  engendered  by 
the  religious  tensions  of  the  period  is  Protestant  Germany's 
refusal  until  1700  to  accept  the  Gregorian  calendar  introduced 
by  the  papacy  in  1582  because  the  reform  entailed  a  one-time 
loss  of  the  days  between  October  5  and  14.  Many  Protestants 
suspected  that  Roman  Catholics  were  attempting  somehow  to 
steal  this  time  for  themselves. 

By  the  first  decades  of  the  seventeenth  century,  religious 
controversy  had  become  so  obstructive  that  at  times  the  Reichs- 
tag could  not  conduct  business.  In  1608,  for  example,  Calvin- 
ists  walked  out  of  the  body,  preventing  the  levying  of  a  tax  to 
fight  a  war  against  the  Turks.  In  the  same  year,  the  Evangelical 
Union  was  established  by  a  few  states  and  cities  of  the  empire  to 
defend  the  Protestant  cause.  In  1609  a  number  of  Roman  Cath- 
olic states  countered  by  forming  the  Catholic  League. 
Although  both  bodies  were  less  concerned  with  a  sectarian  war 
than  with  the  specific  aims  of  their  member  states,  their  forma- 


23 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

tion  was  an  indication  of  how  easily  disputes  could  acquire  a 
religious  aspect. 

Military  Campaigns 

The  Thirty  Years'  War  resulted  from  a  local  rebellion,  but  the 
admixture  of  religion  transformed  it  into  a  European  conflict 
that  lasted  for  more  than  a  generation  and  devastated  Ger- 
many. In  1618  Bohemian  nobles  opposed  the  decision  of 
Emperor  Matthias  (r.  1608-19)  to  designate  his  Catholic  cousin 
Ferdinand  king  of  Bohemia.  Instead,  the  nobles  elected  Fred- 
erick of  the  Palatinate,  a  German  Calvinist,  to  be  their  king.  In 
1620,  in  an  attempt  to  wrest  control  from  the  nobles,  imperial 
armies  and  the  Catholic  League  under  General  Johann  von 
Tilly  defeated  the  Protestant  Bohemians  at  the  Battle  of  White 
Mountain  near  Prague.  The  Protestant  princes,  alarmed  by  the 
strength  of  the  Catholic  League  and  the  possibility  of  Roman 
Catholic  supremacy  in  Europe,  decided  to  renew  their  struggle 
against  Emperor  Matthias.  They  were  aided  by  France,  which, 
although  Roman  Catholic,  was  opposed  to  the  increasing 
power  of  the  Habsburgs,  the  dynastic  family  to  which  Matthias 
and  Ferdinand  belonged.  Despite  French  aid,  by  the  late  1620s 
imperial  armies  of  Emperor  Ferdinand  II  (r.  1619-37)  and  the 
Catholic  League,  under  the  supreme  command  of  General 
Albrecht  von  Wallenstein,  had  defeated  the  Protestants  and 
secured  a  foothold  in  northern  Germany. 

In  his  time  of  triumph,  Ferdinand  overreached  himself  by 
publishing  in  1629  the  Edict  of  Restitution,  which  required 
that  all  properties  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  taken  since 
1552  be  returned  to  their  original  owners.  The  edict  renewed 
Protestant  resistance.  Catholic  powers  also  began  to  oppose 
Ferdinand  because  they  feared  he  was  becoming  too  powerful. 
Invading  armies  from  Sweden,  secretly  supported  by  Catholic 
France,  marched  deep  into  Germany,  winning  numerous  victo- 
ries. The  Catholic  general  Tilly  and  Sweden's  Protestant  king, 
Gustavus  Adolphus,  were  killed  in  separate  battles.  Wallenstein 
was  assassinated  on  Emperor  Ferdinand's  orders  because  he 
feared  his  general  was  becoming  too  powerful.  After  the  tri- 
umph of  the  Spanish  army  over  Swedish  forces  at  the  Battle  of 
Nordlingen  in  1634,  a  truce  was  arranged  between  the 
emperor  and  some  of  the  German  princes  under  the  Treaty  of 
Prague.  France  then  invaded  Germany,  not  for  religious  rea- 
sons but  because  the  House  of  Bourbon,  the  dynastic  family  of 
several  French  and  Spanish  monarchs,  wished  to  ensure  that 


24 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

the  House  of  Habsburg  did  not  become  too  powerful.  This 
invasion  is  illustrative  of  the  French  axiom  that  Germany  must 
always  remain  divided  into  small,  easily  manipulated  states. 
(Indeed,  preventing  a  united  Germany  remained  an  objective 
of  French  foreign  policy  even  late  in  the  twentieth  century.) 
Because  of  French  participation,  the  war  continued  until  the 
Peace  of  Westphalia  was  signed  in  1648. 

The  Peace  of  Westphalia 

The  Peace  of  Westphalia  largely  settled  German  affairs  for 
the  next  century  and  a  half.  It  ended  religious  conflicts 
between  the  states  and  included  official  recognition  of  Calvin- 
ism. Its  signatories  altered  the  boundaries  of  the  empire  by  rec- 
ognizing that  Switzerland  and  the  Netherlands  had  become 
sovereign  states  outside  the  empire.  Portions  of  Alsace  and  Lor- 
raine went  to  France.  Sweden  received  some  territory  in  north- 
ern Germany,  which  in  the  long  run  it  could  not  retain. 
Brandenburg  became  stronger,  as  did  Saxony  and  Bavaria.  In 
addition,  states  within  the  empire  acquired  greater  indepen- 
dence with  the  right  to  have  their  own  foreign  policies  and 
form  alliances,  even  with  states  outside  the  empire.  As  a  result 
of  these  changes,  the  Holy  Roman  Empire  lost  much  of  what 
remained  of  its  power  and  would  never  again  be  a  significant 
actor  on  the  international  stage.  The  Habsburgs  would  con- 
tinue to  be  crowned  emperors,  but  their  strength  would  derive 
from  their  own  holdings,  not  from  leadership  of  the  empire. 
Germany  was  less  united  in  1648  than  in  1618,  and  German 
particularism  had  been  strengthened  once  again. 

The  Thirty  Years'  War  had  a  devastating  effect  on  the  Ger- 
man people.  Historians  have  usually  estimated  that  between 
one-fourth  and  one-third  of  the  population  perished  from 
direct  military  causes  or  from  illness  and  starvation  related  to 
the  war.  Some  regions  were  affected  much  more  than  others. 
For  example,  an  estimated  three-quarters  of  Wurttemberg's 
population  died  between  1634  and  1639.  Overall  losses  were 
serious  enough  that  historians  believe  that  it  took  a  century 
after  the  Thirty  Years'  War  for  Germany's  population  to  reach 
the  level  of  1618. 

Germany's  economy  was  also  severely  disrupted  by  the  rav- 
ages of  the  Thirty  Years'  War.  The  war  exacerbated  the  eco- 
nomic decline  that  had  begun  in  the  second  half  of  the 
sixteenth  century  as  the  European  economy  shifted  westward 
to  the  Atlantic  states — Spain,  France,  England,  and  the  Low 


25 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Countries.  The  shift  in  trade  meant  that  Germany  was  no 
longer  located  at  the  center  of  European  commerce  but  on  its 
fringes.  The  thriving  economies  of  many  German  towns  in  the 
late  Middle  Ages  and  first  half  of  the  sixteenth  century  gradu- 
ally dried  up,  and  Germany  as  a  whole  entered  a  long  period  of 
economic  stagnation  that  ended  only  in  the  second  half  of  the 
nineteenth  century. 

The  Age  of  Enlightened  Absolutism,  1648-1 789 

Although  the  Holy  Roman  Empire  no  longer  had  a  signifi- 
cant role  in  European  politics  after  the  Thirty  Years'  War,  it 
remained  important  in  Germany,  providing  a  framework  for 
the  many  German  states'  and  cities'  conduct  of  their  public 
affairs.  The  Reichstag,  which  remained  in  session  at  Regens- 
burg  from  1663  until  the  empire's  dissolution  in  1806,  pro- 
vided a  forum  for  the  settlement  of  disputes.  On  occasion, 
votes  were  taken  to  remove  incompetent  or  tyrannical  rulers  of 
member  states.  The  empire's  most  important  service  was  that  it 
provided  a  measure  of  security  to  Germany's  many  small  states 
and  free  cities,  without  which  some  would  have  been  swallowed 
up  by  larger  neighbors.  Because  of  its  weakened  condition,  the 
empire  could  no  longer  dominate  Germany,  even  when 
headed  by  ambitious  and  capable  men  such  as  Charles  VI  (r. 
1711-40).  During  the  1720s,  he  attempted  unsuccessfully  to 
breathe  new  life  into  the  empire.  Later  emperors  returned  to 
the  traditional  Habsburg  practice  of  using  the  imperial  throne 
to  benefit  their  own  dynastic  holdings. 

For  nearly  a  century  after  the  Peace  of  Westphalia,  the  main 
danger  to  German  states  came  from  abroad.  France  was  the 
chief  threat,  seizing  parts  of  southwestern  Germany  in  the  late 
1600s,  among  them  the  city  of  Strasbourg  in  1681.  French 
troops  also  fought  on  German  soil  during  the  War  of  the  Span- 
ish Succession  (1701-14).  In  addition  to  these  military  actions, 
France  formed  alliances  with  some  German  states,  most  signifi- 
cantly with  Bavaria,  which  sought  support  against  neighboring 
Austria.  The  Ottoman  Empire  also  posed  a  threat.  In  1683  its 
forces  besieged  Vienna.  The  Germans  ultimately  were  success- 
ful against  the  Ottoman  Empire,  and  after  the  Treaty  of  Passa- 
rowitz  of  1 71 8,  the  Turks  were  no  longer  a  danger. 

Austria  and  Prussia 

The  most  important  German  power  after  the  Peace  of  West-

phalia  was  Austria,  followed  by  a  few  other  states  with  much 
smaller  populations,  most  notably  Brandenburg,  Saxony,  and 
Bavaria.  Austria  retained  its  preeminence  until  the  second  half 
of  the  nineteenth  century,  but  in  the  eighteenth  century  Bran- 
denburg had  become  a  serious  rival,  annexing  valuable  Aus- 
trian territory.  The  rivalry  came  to  form  the  so-called  dualism 
of  the  empire,  that  is,  the  presence  in  it  of  two  powerful  states, 
neither  of  which  was  strong  enough  to  dominate  the  empire 
and  for  that  reason  sought  the  support  of  smaller  states.  The 
smaller  states  worked  to  derive  their  own  advantages  from  Ger- 
man dualism,  none  being  willing  to  cede  sovereignty  to  either 
Austria  or  Prussia. 

In  1648  Brandenburg  was  a  small  state  in  northern  Ger- 
many. It  had  been  ruled  by  the  Hohenzollern  Dynasty  since  the 
late  fifteenth  century  and  consisted  of  the  core  region  and  its 
capital,  Berlin:  eastern  Pomerania;  an  area  around  Magdeburg; 
the  former  holdings  of  the  Knights  of  the  Teutonic  Order  in 
eastern  Prussia;  and  some  smaller  holdings  in  western  Ger- 
many. Brandenburg  became  known  as  Prussia  in  1701  when  its 
ruler  crowned  himself  King  Frederick  I  of  Prussia.  Prussia 
acquired  the  rest  of  Pomerania  after  defeating  Sweden  in  the 
Great  Northern  War  (1700-21).  Prussia's  increase  in  size  and 
influence  may  be  attributed  to  a  succession  of  capable  leaders, 
all  of  whom  enjoyed  long  reigns.  The  first  was  Frederick  Will- 
iam (r.  1640-88),  known  as  the  Great  Elector.  He  increased  his 
family's  power  by  granting  favors  to  the  nobility,  weakening  the 
independence  of  the  towns,  and  maintaining  a  professional 
standing  army.  His  son  Frederick  I  (r.  1688-1713)  established 
Prussia  as  a  kingdom.  Frederick  further  strengthened  the  army, 
but  not  nearly  as  much  as  his  son  Frederick  William  I  (r.  1713- 
40),  who  also  modernized  the  kingdom's  bureaucracy.  Freder- 
ick II  (r.  1740-86),  known  to  posterity  as  Frederick  the  Great, 
continued  along  the  same  lines  as  his  father  but  showed  much 
greater  imagination  and  ruthlessness,  transforming  his  small 
kingdom  into  one  of  the  great  powers  of  Europe. 

In  1740  Frederick  seized  Silesia,  a  wealthy  province  that 
belonged  to  the  Habsburgs  and  had  a  population  of  about  1 
million  inhabitants.  Maria  Theresa  (r.  1740-80),  the  new  Habs- 
burg  empress,  was  unable  to  regain  possession  of  Silesia,  which 
remained  under  Prussian  control  at  the  end  of  the  War  of  the 
Austrian  Succession  (1740-48).  Frederick  retained  Silesia  even 
after  facing  a  coalition  of  France,  Austria,  and  Russia  during 
the  Seven  Years'  War  (1756-63).  Frederick  expanded  Prussian

territory  still  further  in  1772,  when,  with  his  erstwhile  enemies 
Russia  and  Austria,  he  took  part  in  the  First  Partition  of 
Poland.  This  last  seizure  was  highly  beneficial  to  Frederick 
because  it  linked  eastern  Prussia  with  much  of  his  kingdom's 
western  holdings. 

Although  Prussia  and  Austria  were  rivals,  they  had  some 
important  characteristics  in  common.  Neither  state  was  popu- 
lated by  a  single  people,  but  by  numerous  peoples  speaking  dif- 
ferent languages  and  belonging  to  different  religions.  Neither 
state  was  located  entirely  within  the  empire.  Both  had  sizable 
territories  to  the  east  of  the  empire,  and  it  was  there  that  they 
hoped  mainly  to  expand.  Both  states  were  governed  by  enlight- 
ened monarchs,  who,  having  only  to  cajole  the  nobility  with 
occasional  concessions,  saw  government  as  for  the  people  but 
not  by  the  people.  Hence,  both  states  were  governed  by  the 
most  efficient  methods  known  to  the  eighteenth  century,  and 
both  were  fairly  tolerant  according  to  the  standards  of  the  time. 
Prussia  accepted  many  Protestants  expelled  from  other  states, 
most  notably  the  Huguenots  who  fled  France  after  the  Edict  of 
Nantes  in  1685.  Austria  became  one  of  the  first  states  to  allow 
Jews  to  settle  where  they  liked  within  its  boundaries  and  to 
practice  the  professions  of  their  choice. 

The  Smaller  States 

By  the  eighteenth  century,  none  of  the  other  states  of  the 
empire  were  strong  enough  to  have  territorial  ambitions  to 
match  those  of  Prussia  and  Austria.  Some  of  the  larger  states, 
such  as  Saxony,  Bavaria,  and  Wurttemberg,  also  maintained 
standing  armies,  but  their  smaller  size  compelled  them  to  seek 
allies,  some  from  outside  the  empire.  With  the  exception  of  the 
free  cities  and  ecclesiastical  states,  smaller  states,  like  Austria 
and  Prussia,  were  governed  by  a  hereditary  monarch  who  ruled 
either  with  the  consent  or  help  of  the  nobility  and  with  the 
help  of  an  increasingly  well-trained  bureaucracy.  Only  a  few 
states,  such  as  Wurttemberg,  could  boast  of  an  active  democ- 
racy of  the  kind  evolving  in  Britain  and  France.  Except  in  a  few 
free  cities,  such  as  Frankfurt  am  Main  and  Hamburg,  which 
were  active  in  international  trade,  Germany's  commercial  class 
was  neither  strong  nor  self-confident.  Farmers  in  western  Ger- 
many were  largely  free;  those  in  the  east  were  often  serfs.  How- 
ever, whether  in  the  east  or  the  west,  most  who  worked  the  land 
lived  at  the  subsistence  level.

Despite  its  lack  of  popular  democracy,  Germany  was  gener- 
ally well  governed.  The  state  bureaucracies  gained  in  power 
and  expertise,  and  efficiency  and  probity  were  esteemed.  Dur- 
ing the  eighteenth  century,  the  principles  of  the  Enlighten- 
ment came  to  be  widely  disseminated  and  applied.  Although 
there  were  no  political  challenges  to  enlightened  absolutism, 
as  was  the  case  in  France,  all  phenomena,  including  religion, 
were  subject  to  critical,  reasoned  examination  to  determine 
their  rationality.  In  this  more  tolerant  environment,  differing 
religious  views  could  still  create  social  friction,  but  ways  were 
found  for  the  empire's  three  main  religions — Roman  Catholi- 
cism, Lutheranism,  and  Calvinism — to  coexist  in  most  states. 
The  expulsion  of  about  20,000  Protestants  from  the  ecclesiasti- 
cal state  of  Salzburg  during  1731-32  was  viewed  by  the  edu- 
cated public  at  the  time  as  a  harking  back  to  less  enlightened 
days. 

Several  new  universities  were  founded,  some  soon  consid- 
ered among  Europe's  best.  An  increasingly  literate  public  made 
possible  a  jump  in  the  number  of  journals  and  newspapers.  At 
the  end  of  the  seventeenth  century,  most  books  printed  in  Ger- 
many were  in  Latin.  By  the  end  of  the  next  century,  all  but  5 
percent  were  in  German.  The  eighteenth  century  also  saw  a 
refinement  of  the  German  language  and  a  flowering  of  Ger- 
man literature  with  the  appearance  of  such  figures  as  Gotthold

Lessing,  Johann  Wolfgang  von  Goethe,  and  Friedrich  Schiller. 
German  music  also  reached  great  heights  with  the  Bach  family, 
George  Frederick  Handel,  Joseph  Haydn,  and  Wolfgang  Ama- 
deus  Mozart. 

The  French  Revolution  and  Germany 

The  French  Revolution,  which  erupted  in  1789  with  the 
storming  of  the  Bastille  in  Paris,  at  first  gained  the  enthusiastic 
approval  of  some  German  intellectuals,  who  welcomed  the 
proclamation  of  a  constitution  and  a  bill  of  rights.  Within  a  few 
years,  most  of  this  support  had  dissipated,  replaced  by  fear  of  a 
newly  aggressive  French  nationalism  and  horror  at  the  execu- 
tion of  the  revolution's  opponents.  In  1792  French  troops 
invaded  Germany  and  were  at  first  pushed  back  by  imperial 
forces.  But  at  the  Battle  of  Valmy  in  late  1792,  the  French  army, 
a  revolutionary  citizens'  army  fighting  on  its  own  soil,  defeated 
the  professional  imperial  army.  By  1794  France  had  secured 
control  of  the  Rhineland,  which  it  was  to  occupy  for  twenty 
years. 

During  the  Rhineland  occupation,  France  followed  its  tradi- 
tional policy  of  keeping  Austria  and  Prussia  apart  and  manipu- 
lating the  smaller  German  states.  In  observance  of  the  Treaty 
of  Basel  of  1795,  Prussian  and  German  forces  north  of  the 
Main  River  ceased  efforts  against  the  French.  Austria  endured 
repeated  defeats  at  the  hands  of  the  French,  most  notably  at 
the  Battle  of  Austerlitz  in  1805.  At  this  battle,  Russians  fought 
alongside  Austrians  against  the  French,  who  were  aided  by 
forces  from  several  south  German  states,  including  Bavaria, 
Baden,  and  Wurttemberg. 

Prussia  reentered  the  war  against  France  in  1806,  but  its 
forces  were  badly  beaten  at  the  Battle  of  Jena  that  same  year. 
Prussia  was  abandoned  by  its  ally  Russia  and  lost  territory  as  a 
result  of  the  Treaty  of  Tilsit  in  1807.  These  national  humilia- 
tions motivated  the  Prussians  to  undertake  a  serious  program 
of  social  and  military  reform.  The  most  noted  of  the  reform- 
ers— Karl  vom  Stein,  Karl  August  von  Hardenberg,  Wilhelm 
von  Humboldt,  and  Gerhard  von  Scharnhorst,  along  with 
many  others — improved  the  country's  laws,  education,  admin- 
istration, and  military  organization.  Scharnhorst,  responsible 
for  military  reforms,  emphasized  the  importance  to  the  army 
of  moral  incentives,  personal  courage,  and  individual  responsi- 
bility. He  also  introduced  the  principle  of  competition  and 
abandoned  the  privileges  accorded  to  nobility  within  the  offi-

cer  corps.  A  revitalized  Prussia  joined  with  Austria  and  Russia 
to  defeat  Napoleon  at  the  Battle  of  Leipzig  in  late  1813  and 
drove  him  out  of  Germany.  Prussian  forces  under  General  Geb- 
hard  von  Blucher  were  essential  to  the  final  victory  over  Napo- 
leon at  the  Battle  of  Waterloo  in  1815. 

Despite  Napoleon's  defeat,  some  of  the  changes  he  had 
brought  to  Germany  during  the  French  occupation  were 
retained.  Public  administration  was  improved,  feudalism  was 
weakened,  the  power  of  the  trade  guilds  was  reduced,  and  the 
Napoleonic  Code  replaced  traditional  legal  codes  in  many 
areas.  The  new  legal  code  was  popular  and  remained  in  effect 
in  the  Rhineland  until  1900.  As  a  result  of  these  reforms,  some 
areas  of  Germany  were  better  prepared  for  the  coming  of 
industrialization  in  the  nineteenth  century. 

French  occupation  authorities  also  allowed  many  smaller 
states,  ecclesiastical  entities,  and  free  cities  to  be  incorporated 
into  their  larger  neighbors.  Approximately  300  states  had 
existed  within  the  Holy  Roman  Empire  in  1789;  only  about 
forty  remained  by  1814.  The  empire  ceased  to  exist  in  1806 
when  Francis  II  of  Austria  gave  up  his  imperial  title.  In  its  place, 
Napoleon  had  created  the  Confederation  of  the  Rhine,  made 
up  of  the  states  of  western  and  southern  Germany,  under 
French  direction.  Austria  and  Prussia  were  not  members.  The 
confederation  was  to  provide  Napoleon  with  troops  for  his  mil- 
itary campaigns.  After  his  defeat,  the  confederation  was  dis- 
solved. 

The  German  Confederation,  1815-66 

The  Congress  of  Vienna  (1814-15),  convened  after  Napo- 
leon's defeat,  sought  to  restore  order  to  a  Europe  disrupted  by 
revolutionary  and  imperial  France.  Its  members'  objective  was 
a  constellation  of  states  and  a  balance  of  power  that  would 
ensure  peace  and  stability  after  a  quarter-century  of  revolution 
and  war.  In  addition  to  the  delegates  of  many  small  states,  the 
congress  included  representatives  of  five  large  European  states: 
Austria,  Prussia,  Russia,  Britain,  and  France.  After  months  of 
deliberations,  the  congress  established  an  international  politi- 
cal order  that  was  to  endure  for  nearly  100  years  and  that 
brought  Europe  a  measure  of  peace. 

The  congress  made  no  effort  to  restore  the  Holy  Roman 
Empire  and  its  300-odd  states.  Instead,  it  accepted  the  disap- 
pearance of  many  small  states  that  had  occurred  since  1789 
and  created  the  German  Confederation.  The  confederation 


31 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

consisted  of  thirty-eight  sovereign  states  and  four  free  cities 
and  included  the  five  large  kingdoms  of  Austria,  Prussia,  Sax- 
ony, Bavaria,  and  Wurttemberg  (see  fig.  4).  The  confederation 
met  at  a  diet  in  Frankfurt,  with  an  Austrian  always  serving  as 
president. 

Prince  Clemens  von  Metternich,  who  directed  Austria's  for- 
eign policy  from  1809  until  1848,  was  the  dominant  political 
figure  within  the  confederation.  He  waged  a  decades-long  cam- 
paign to  prevent  the  spread  of  revolution  in  Europe  by  seeking 
to  restore  much  of  the  political  and  social  order  that  had 
existed  before  the  French  Revolution.  Metternich's  Carlsbad 
Decrees  of  1819  established  a  pervasive  system  of  press  censor- 
ship and  regulation  of  the  universities  that  dampened  German 
intellectual  life  and  hindered  the  publication  of  writings  advo- 
cating the  principles  of  liberalism.  In  the  1820s,  he  engineered 
the  formation  of  the  Holy  Alliance  of  the  monarchs  of  Austria, 
Prussia,  and  Russia  to  quash  political,  social,  and  economic 
developments  within  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  thought  to 
threaten  political  stability. 

Economic  and  Political  Trends  Toward  Unification 

It  was  not  possible  for  Metternich  and  his  allies  to  suppress 
completely  the  desire  for  liberal  reforms,  including  the  estab- 
lishment of  constitutional  parliamentary  government,  eco- 
nomic freedom,  and  civil  liberties.  Some  of  these  reforms  had 
already  been  under  discussion  during  the  eighteenth-century 
Enlightenment,  and  awareness  of  their  desirability  had  spread 
during  the  Napoleonic  era.  In  addition,  the  economic  reforms 
introduced  into  the  Rhineland  by  France  had  taken  hold.  The 
business  class  that  formed  after  1815  pressed  for  abolition  of 
restrictive  trade  practices  favored  by  traditional  handicraft 
guilds.  Businessmen  also  sought  a  common  currency  and  sys- 
tem of  measurements  for  Germany,  as  well  as  a  reduction  of 
the  numerous  tolls  that  made  road  and  river  travel  expensive 
and  slow. 

During  the  1820s,  significant  progress  was  made  in  reducing 
customs  duties  among  German  states.  At  Prussian  instigation, 
the  Zollverein  (Customs  Union)  began  to  form,  and  by  the 
mid-1 830s  it  included  all  the  most  important  German  states 
except  Austria.  Prussia  saw  to  it  that  its  chief  rival  within  Ger- 
many was  excluded  from  the  union.  Vienna,  for  its  part,  did 
not  realize  at  this  early  point  the  political  and  economic  signifi- 
cance of  intra-German  trade.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Germany's  lower  classes — farmers,  artisans,  and  factory 
workers — were  not  included  in  the  discussions  about  political 
and  economic  reform.  Germany's  farmers  had  been  freed  to 
some  degree  from  many  obligations  and  dues  owed  to  the 
landowning  aristocracy,  but  they  were  often  desperately  poor, 
earning  barely  enough  to  survive.  Farmers  west  of  the  Elbe 
River  usually  had  properties  too  small  to  yield  any  kind  of  pros- 
perity. Farmers  east  of  the  Elbe  often  were  landless  laborers 
hired  to  work  on  large  estates.  Artisans,  that  is,  skilled  workers 
in  handicrafts  and  trades  belonging  to  the  traditional  guilds, 
saw  their  economic  position  worsen  as  a  result  of  the  industrial- 
ization that  had  begun  to  appear  in  Germany  after  1815.  The 
guilds  attempted  to  stop  factory  construction  and  unrestricted 
commerce,  but  strong  economic  trends  ran  counter  to  their 
wishes.  Factory  workers,  in  contrast,  were  doing  well  compared 
with  these  other  groups  and  were  generally  content  with  their 
lot  when  the  economy  as  a  whole  prospered. 

The  Revolutions  of  1 848 

Europe  endured  hard  times  during  much  of  the  1840s.  A 
series  of  bad  harvests  culminating  in  the  potato  blight  of  1845- 
46  brought  widespread  misery  and  some  starvation.  An  eco- 
nomic depression  added  to  the  hardship,  spreading  discontent 
among  the  poor  and  the  middle  class  alike.  A  popular  uprising 
in  Paris  in  February  1848  turned  into  a  revolution,  forcing  the 
French  king  Louis  Philippe  to  flee  to  Britain. 

The  success  of  the  revolution  sparked  revolts  elsewhere  in 
Europe.  Numerous  German  cities  were  shaken  by  uprisings  in 
which  crowds  consisting  mainly  of  the  urban  poor,  but  also  of 
students  and  members  of  the  liberal  middle  class,  stormed 
their  rulers'  palaces  and  demanded  fundamental  reform.  Ber- 
lin and  Vienna  were  especially  hard  hit  by  what  came  to  be 
called  the  revolutions  of  1848.  The  rulers  of  both  cities,  like 
rulers  elsewhere,  quickly  acceded  to  the  demands  of  their 
rebellious  subjects  and  promised  constitutions  and  representa- 
tive government.  Conservative  governments  fell,  and  Metter- 
nich  fled  to  Britain.  Liberals  called  for  a  national  convention  to 
draft  a  constitution  for  all  of  Germany.  The  National  Assembly, 
consisting  of  about  800  delegates  from  throughout  Germany, 
met  in  a  church  in  Frankfurt,  the  Paulskirche,  from  May  1848 
to  March  1849  for  this  purpose.

The  Restoration 

Within  just  a  few  months,  liberal  hopes  for  a  reformed  Ger- 
many were  disappointed.  Conservative  forces  saw  that  the  lib- 
eral movement  was  divided  into  a  number  of  camps  having 
sharply  different  aims.  Furthermore,  the  liberals  had  little  sup- 
port left  among  the  lower  classes,  who  had  supported  them  in 
the  first  weeks  of  the  revolution  by  constructing  barricades  and 
massing  before  their  rulers'  palaces.  Few  liberals  desired  popu- 
lar democracy  or  were  willing  to  enact  radical  economic 
reforms  that  would  help  farmers  and  artisans.  As  a  result  of  this 
timidity,  the  masses  deserted  the  liberals.  Thus,  conservatives 
were  able  to  win  sizable  elements  of  these  groups  to  their  side 
by  promising  to  address  their  concerns.  Factory  workers  had 
largely  withheld  support  from  the  liberal  cause  because  they 
earned  relatively  good  wages  compared  with  farmers  and  arti- 
sans. 

Once  the  conservatives  regrouped  and  launched  their  suc- 
cessful counterattack  across  Germany,  many  of  the  reforms 
promised  in  March  1848  were  forgotten.  The  National  Assem- 
bly published  the  constitution  it  had  drafted  during  months  of 
hard  debate.  It  proposed  the  unification  of  Germany  as  a  feder- 
ation with  a  hereditary  emperor  and  a  parliament  with  dele- 
gates elected  directly.  The  constitution  resolved  the  dispute 
between  supporters  of  "Little  Germany,"  that  is,  a  united  Ger- 
many that  would  exclude  Austria  and  the  Habsburg  Empire, 
and  those  supporting  "Large  Germany,"  which  would  include 
both.  The  constitution  advocated  the  latter. 

The  Prussian  king,  Friedrich  Wilhelm  IV  (r.  1840-58),  was 
elected  united  Germany's  first  emperor.  He  refused  the  crown, 
stating  that  he  could  be  elected  only  by  other  kings.  At  that 
point,  the  assembly  disbanded.  A  few  subsequent  rebellions  by 
democratic  liberals  drew  some  popular  support  in  1849,  but 
they  were  easily  crushed  and  their  leaders  executed  or  impris- 
oned. Some  of  these  ardent  democrats  fled  to  the  United 
States.  Among  them  was  Carl  Schurz,  who  later  fought  at  the 
Battle  of  Gettysburg  as  a  Union  officer,  served  one  term  as  a 
United  States  senator  from  Missouri,  and  was  appointed  secre- 
tary of  the  interior  by  United  States  president  Rutherford  B. 
Hayes. 

The  German  Confederation  was  reestablished,  and  conser- 
vatives held  the  reins  of  power  even  more  tightly  than  before. 
The  failure  of  the  1848  revolutions  also  meant  that  Germany 
was  not  united  as  many  had  hoped.  However,  some  of  the  liber-

als'  more  practical  proposals  came  to  fruition  later  in  the  1850s 
and  1860s  when  it  was  realized  that  they  were  essential  to  eco- 
nomic efficiency.  Many  commercial  restrictions  were  abolished. 
The  guilds,  with  their  desire  to  turn  back  the  clock  and  restore 
preindustrial  conditions,  were  defeated,  and  impediments  to 
the  free  use  of  capital  were  reduced.  The  "hungry  forties"  gave 
way  to  the  prosperity  of  the  1850s  as  the  German  economy 
modernized  and  laid  the  foundations  for  spectacular  growth 
later  in  the  century. 

Bismarck  and  Unification 

Liberal  hopes  for  German  unification  were  not  met  during 
the  politically  turbulent  1848-49  period.  A  Prussian  plan  for  a 
smaller  union  was  dropped  in  late  1850  after  Austria  threat- 
ened Prussia  with  war.  Despite  this  setback,  desire  for  some 
kind  of  German  unity,  either  with  or  without  Austria,  grew  dur- 
ing the  1850s  and  1860s.  It  was  no  longer  a  notion  cherished  by 
a  few,  but  had  proponents  in  all  social  classes.  An  indication  of 
this  wider  range  of  support  was  the  change  of  mind  about  Ger- 
man nationalism  experienced  by  an  obscure  Prussian  diplo- 
mat, Otto  von  Bismarck.  He  had  been  an  adamant  opponent  of 
German  nationalism  in  the  late  1840s.  During  the  1850s,  how- 
ever, Bismarck  had  concluded  that  Prussia  would  have  to  har- 
ness German  nationalism  for  its  own  purposes  if  it  were  to 
thrive.  He  believed  too  that  Prussia's  well-being  depended  on 
wresting  primacy  in  Germany  from  its  traditional  enemy,  Aus- 
tria. 

In  1862  King  Wilhelm  I  of  Prussia  (r.  1858-88)  chose  Bis- 
marck to  serve  as  his  minister  president.  Descended  from  the 
Junker,  Prussia's  aristocratic  landowning  class,  Bismarck  hated 
parliamentary  democracy  and  championed  the  dominance  of 
the  monarchy  and  aristocracy.  However,  gifted  at  judging  polit- 
ical forces  and  sizing  up  a  situation,  Bismarck  contended  that 
conservatives  would  have  to  come  to  terms  with  other  social 
groups  if  they  were  to  continue  to  direct  Prussian  affairs.  The 
king  had  summoned  Bismarck  to  direct  Prussia's  government 
in  the  face  of  the  Prussian  parliament's  refusal  to  pass  a  budget 
because  it  disagreed  with  army  reforms  desired  by  the  king  and 
his  military  advisers.  Although  he  could  not  secure  parlia- 
ment's consent  to  the  government's  budget,  Bismarck  was  a  tac- 
tician skilled  and  ruthless  enough  to  govern  without  parlia- 
ment's consent  from  1862  to  1866.

As  an  ardent  and  aggressive  Prussian  nationalist,  Bismarck 
had  long  been  an  opponent  of  Austria  because  both  states 
sought  primacy  within  the  same  area — Germany.  Austria  had 
been  weakened  by  reverses  abroad,  including  the  loss  of  terri- 
tory in  Italy,  and  by  the  1860s,  because  of  clumsy  diplomacy, 
had  no  foreign  allies  outside  Germany.  Bismarck  used  a  diplo- 
matic dispute  to  provoke  Austria  to  declare  war  on  Prussia  in 
1866.  Against  expectations,  Prussia  quickly  won  the  Seven 
Weeks'  War  (also  known  as  the  Austro-Prussian  War)  against 
Austria  and  its  south  German  allies.  Bismarck  imposed  a 
lenient  peace  on  Austria  because  he  recognized  that  Prussia 
might  later  need  the  Austrians  as  allies.  But  he  dealt  harshly 
with  the  other  German  states  that  had  resisted  Prussia  and 
expanded  Prussian  territory  by  annexing  Hanover,  Schleswig- 
Holstein,  some  smaller  states,  and  the  city  of  Frankfurt.  The 
German  Confederation  was  replaced  by  the  North  German 
Confederation  and  was  furnished  with  both  a  constitution  and 
a  parliament.  Austria  was  excluded  from  Germany.  South  Ger- 
man states  outside  the  confederation — Baden,  Wurttemberg, 
and  Bavaria — were  tied  to  Prussia  by  military  alliances. 

Bismarck's  military  and  political  successes  were  remarkable, 
but  the  first  had  been  achieved  at  considerable  risk,  and  the 
second  were  by  no  means  complete.  Luck  had  played  a  part  in 
the  decisive  victory  at  the  Battle  of  Koniggratz  (Hradec  Kralove 


39 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  present-day  Czech  Republic);  otherwise,  the  war  might 
have  lasted  much  longer  than  it  did.  None  of  the  larger  Ger- 
man states  had  supported  either  Prussia's  war  or  the  formation 
of  the  North  German  Confederation  led  by  Prussia.  The  states 
that  formed  what  is  often  called  the  Third  Germany,  that  is, 
Germany  exclusive  of  Austria  and  Prussia,  did  not  desire  to 
come  under  the  control  of  either  of  those  states.  None  of  them 
wished  to  be  pulled  into  a  war  that  showed  little  likelihood  of 
benefiting  any  of  them.  In  the  Seven  Weeks'  War,  the  support 
they  gave  Austria  had  been  lukewarm. 

In  1870  Bismarck  engineered  another  war,  this  time  against 
France.  The  conflict  would  become  known  to  history  as  the 
Franco-Prussian  War.  Nationalistic  fervor  was  ignited  by  the 
promised  annexation  of  Lorraine  and  Alsace,  which  had 
belonged  to  the  Holy  Roman  Empire  and  had  been  seized  by 
France  in  the  seventeenth  century.  With  this  goal  in  sight,  the 
south  German  states  eagerly  joined  in  the  war  against  the  coun- 
try that  had  come  to  be  seen  as  Germany's  traditional  enemy. 
Bismarck's  major  war  aim — the  voluntary  entry  of  the  south 
German  states  into  a  constitutional  German  nation-state — 
occurred  during  the  patriotic  frenzy  generated  by  stunning 
military  victories  against  French  forces  in  the  fall  of  1870. 
Months  before  a  peace  treaty  was  signed  with  France  in  May 
1871,  a  united  Germany  was  established  as  the  German 
Empire,  and  the  Prussian  king,  Wilhelm  I,  was  crowned  its 
emperor  in  the  Hall  of  Mirrors  at  Versailles. 

Imperial  Germany 

The  German  Empire — often  called  the  Second  Reich  to  dis- 
tinguish it  from  the  First  Reich,  established  by  Charlemagne  in 
800 — was  based  on  two  compromises.  The  first  was  between  the 
king  of  Prussia  and  the  rulers  of  the  other  German  states,  who 
agreed  to  accept  him  as  the  kaiser  (emperor)  of  a  united  Ger- 
many, provided  they  could  continue  to  rule  their  states  largely 
as  they  had  in  the  past.  The  second  was  the  agreement  among 
many  segments  of  German  society  to  accept  a  unified  Germany 
based  on  a  constitution  that  combined  a  powerful  authoritar- 
ian monarchy  with  a  weak  representative  body,  the  Reichstag, 
elected  by  universal  male  suffrage.  No  one  was  completely  satis- 
fied with  the  bargain.  The  kaiser  had  to  contend  with  a  parlia- 
ment elected  by  the  people  in  a  secret  vote.  The  people  were 
represented  in  a  parliament  having  limited  control  over  the 
kaiser. 


40 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

As  had  been  the  tradition  in  Prussia,  the  kaiser  controlled 
foreign  policy  and  the  army  through  his  handpicked  ministers, 
who  formed  the  government  and  prepared  legislation.  The 
government  was  headed  by  a  chancellor,  also  selected  by  the 
kaiser,  who  served  in  this  post  at  the  kaiser's  pleasure  and  could 
be  dismissed  by  him  at  any  time.  The  Bundesrat  (Federal 
Council)  represented  Germany's  princes.  About  one-third  of 
its  seats  were  held  by  Prussians.  Conceived  as  an  upper  house 
to  the  Reichstag,  the  Bundesrat,  like  the  Reichstag,  was 
required  to  vote  on  legislation  drawn  up  by  the  government 
before  it  became  law.  The  Reichstag  had  no  power  to  draft  leg- 
islation. In  addition,  the  government's  actions  were  not  subject 
to  the  Reichstag's  approval,  and  the  government  was  not  drawn 
from  the  Reichstag,  as  is  ordinarily  the  case  in  parliamentary 
democracies. 

The  government  needed  the  approval  of  the  Bundesrat  and 
the  Reichstag  to  enact  legislative  proposals,  and  the  kaiser  and 
his  chancellor  had  many  means  of  securing  this  approval.  Con- 
servative in  nature,  the  Bundesrat  was  usually  docile  and 
needed  little  wooing.  Compliant  in  the  early  years  of  the 
empire,  the  Reichstag,  by  contrast,  became  less  so  with  time. 
The  easiest  means  of  controlling  the  Reichstag  was  to  threaten 
it  with  new  elections  in  the  hope  of  getting  a  legislative  body 
more  attuned  to  the  intentions  of  the  government.  During 
elections  the  government  campaigned  for  the  parties  it 
favored,  sometimes  cynically  conjuring  up  fears  of  national 
catastrophe  if  particular  parties  won  many  seats.  The  govern- 
ment also  bargained  with  parties,  granting  them  what  they 
sought  in  exchange  for  votes.  A  last  means  of  taming  the  Reich- 
stag was  to  spread  rumors  of  a  possible  coup  d'etat  by  the  army 
and  the  repeal  of  the  constitution  and  universal  suffrage.  This 
technique  was  used  repeatedly  in  imperial  Germany  and  could 
even  frighten  the  conservative  Bundesrat.  However  little  many 
of  the  Reichstag  members  might  like  the  empire's  political 
order,  the  prospect  of  naked  despotism  pleased  them  even  less. 

Although  the  Reichstag  did  not  wield  real  power,  elections  to 
it  were  hotly  contested,  and  Bismarck  and  later  chancellors  and 
governments  were  concerned  with  their  outcome.  As  more- 
democratic  parties  came  to  dominate  in  the  Reichstag,  govern- 
ing became  more  difficult  for  the  kaiser  and  his  officials.  Dur- 
ing the  later  decades  of  the  reign  of  Wilhelm  II  (r.  1888-1918), 
the  empire's  governing  system  experienced  such  difficulties 
that  some  conservatives  advocated  scrapping  it,  and  democrats 


41 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

argued  for  a  new,  truly  parliamentary  system.  A  fear  of  these 
drastic  choices  and  their  possible  effects  caused  Germany  to 
muddle  through  with  the  existing  system  until  the  disaster  of 
World  War  I  culminated  in  that  system's  abolition. 

Political  Parties 

Six  major  political  parties  were  active  in  imperial  Germany: 
the  Conservative  Party,  the  Free  Conservative  Party,  the 
National  Liberal  Party,  the  Progressive  Party,  the  Center  Party, 
and  the  Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany  (Sozial- 
demokratische  Partei  Deutschlands — SPD).  Only  the  SPD  sur- 
vived both  the  empire  and  the  Weimar  Republic  (1918-33) 
and  came  to  play  a  vital  role  in  the  Federal  Republic.  Even 
though  the  German  Empire  lacked  a  genuinely  democratic  sys- 
tem, the  six  main  parties  accurately  reflected  the  interests  and 
hopes  of  most  of  its  people. 

The  most  right-wing  of  the  six  parties  was  the  Conservative 
Party,  which  represented  Prussian  nationalism,  aristocracy,  and 
landed  property.  Many  of  its  members  remained  opposed  to 
German  unification  because  they  feared  Prussia's  gradual 
absorption  by  the  empire.  The  Conservatives  also  detested  the 
Reichstag  because  it  was  elected  by  universal  suffrage.  The  Free 
Conservative  Party  represented  industrialists  and  large  com- 
mercial interests.  The  views  of  this  party  most  closely  matched 
those  of  Bismarck.  Its  members  supported  unification  because 
they  saw  it  as  unavoidable.  The  National  Liberal  Party  was  com- 
posed of  liberals  who  had  accepted  Germany's  lack  of  full 
democracy  because  they  valued  national  unity  more.  They  con- 
tinued to  favor  a  laissez-faire  economic  policy  and  seculariza- 
tion. In  time,  National  Liberals  became  some  of  the  strongest 
supporters  of  the  acquisition  of  colonies  and  a  substantial  naval 
buildup,  both  key  issues  in  the  1880s  and  1890s. 

Unlike  the  members  of  the  National  Liberal  Party,  members 
of  the  Progressive  Party  remained  faithful  to  all  the  principles 
of  European  liberalism  and  championed  the  extension  of  par- 
liament's powers.  This  party  was  in  the  forefront  of  those 
opposed  to  the  authoritarian  rule  of  Bismarck  and  his  succes- 
sors. The  Center  Party  was  Germany's  Roman  Catholic  party 
and  had  strong  support  in  southern  Germany,  the  Rhineland, 
and  in  parts  of  Prussia  with  significant  Polish  populations.  It 
was  conservative  regarding  monarchical  authority  but  progres- 
sive in  matters  of  social  reform.  Bismarck's  brutal  campaign 
against  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  in  the  1870s — the  Kul- 


42 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

turkampf  (cultural  struggle),  an  attempt  to  reduce  the 
church's  power  over  education  and  its  role  in  many  other  areas 
of  German  society — turned  the  Center  Party  against  him.  By 
the  late  1870s,  Bismarck  had  to  concede  victory  to  the  party, 
which  had  become  stronger  through  its  resistance  to  the  gov- 
ernment's persecution.  The  party  remained  important  during 
the  Weimar  Republic  and  was  the  forerunner  of  the  Federal 
Republic's  moderate  conservative  parties,  the  Christian  Demo- 
cratic Union  (Christlich  Demokratische  Union — CDU)  and 
the  Christian  Social  Union  (Christlich-Soziale  Union — CSU). 

The  Marxist  SPD  was  founded  in  Gotha  in  1875,  a  fusion  of 
Ferdinand  Lassalle's  General  German  Workers'  Association 
(formed  in  1863),  which  advocated  state  socialism,  and  the 
Social  Democratic  Labor  Party  (formed  in  1869),  headed  by 
August  Bebel  and  Wilhelm  Liebknecht,  which  aspired  to  estab- 
lish a  classless  communist  society.  The  SPD  advocated  a  mix- 
ture of  revolution  and  quiet  work  within  the  parliamentary 
system.  The  clearest  statement  of  this  impossible  combination 
was  the  Erfurt  Program  of  1891.  The  former  method  fright- 
ened nearly  all  Germans  to  the  party's  right,  while  the  latter 
would  build  the  SPD  into  the  largest  party  in  the  Reichstag 
after  the  elections  of  1912. 

Once  Bismarck  gave  up  his  campaign  against  Germany's 
Roman  Catholics,  whom  he  had  seen  for  a  time  as  a  Vatican- 
controlled  threat  to  the  stability  of  the  empire,  he  attacked  the 
SPD  with  a  series  of  antisocialist  laws  beginning  in  1878.  A  posi- 
tive aspect  of  Bismarck's  campaign  to  contain  the  SPD  was  a 
number  of  laws  passed  in  the  1880s  establishing  national  health 
insurance  and  old-age  pensions.  Bismarck's  hope  was  that  if 
workers  were  protected  by  the  government,  they  would  come 
to  support  it  and  see  no  need  for  revolution.  Bismarck's  antiso- 
cialist campaign,  which  continued  until  his  dismissal  in  1890  by 
Wilhelm  II,  severely  restricted  the  activities  of  the  SPD.  Ironi- 
cally, the  laws  may  have  inadvertently  benefited  the  SPD  by 
forcing  it  to  work  within  legal  channels.  As  a  result  of  its  sus- 
tained activity  within  the  political  system,  the  SPD  became  a 
cautious,  pragmatic  party,  which,  despite  its  fiery  Marxist  rheto- 
ric, won  increasing  numbers  of  seats  in  the  Reichstag  and 
achieved  some  improvements  in  working  and  living  conditions 
for  Germany's  working  class. 

The  Economy  and  Population  Growth 

Germany  experienced  an  economic  boom  immediately  after 


43 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

unification.  For  the  first  time,  the  country  was  a  single  eco- 
nomic entity,  and  old  impediments  to  internal  trade  were 
lifted.  The  federal  chancellery  published  a  new  commercial 
code  and  established  a  uniform  currency.  The  indemnity  that 
France  had  to  pay  Germany  after  losing  the  1870-71  war  pro- 
vided capital  for  railroad  construction  and  building  projects.  A 
speculative  boom  resulted,  characterized  by  large-scale  forma- 
tion of  joint-stock  companies  and  unscrupulous  investment 
practices.  This  period  of  intense  financial  speculation  and  con- 
struction, called  by  Germans  the  Grunderzeit  (founders'  time), 
ended  with  the  stock  market  crash  of  1873. 

Despite  the  crash  and  several  subsequent  periods  of  eco- 
nomic depression,  Germany's  economy  grew  rapidly.  By  1900  it 
rivaled  the  more-established  British  economy  as  the  world's 
largest.  German  coal  production,  about  one-third  of  Britain's 
in  1880,  increased  sixfold  by  1913,  almost  equaling  British 
yields  that  year.  German  steel  production  increased  more  than 
tenfold  in  the  same  period,  surpassing  British  production  by 
far. 

Industrialization  began  later  in  Germany  than  in  Britain, 
and  the  German  economy  was  not  a  significant  part  of  the 
world  economy  until  late  in  the  nineteenth  century  Germany's 
industrialization  started  with  the  building  of  railroads  in  the 
1840s  and  1850s  and  the  subsequent  development  of  coal  min- 
ing and  iron  and  steel  production,  activities  that  made  up  what 
is  called  the  First  Industrial  Revolution.  In  Germany,  the  Sec- 
ond Industrial  Revolution,  that  is,  the  growth  of  chemical  and 
electrical  industries,  followed  the  enormous  expansion  of  coal 
and  steel  production  so  closely  that  the  country  can  be  said  to 
have  experienced  the  two  revolutions  almost  simultaneously. 
Germany  took  an  early  lead  in  the  chemical  and  electrical 
industries.  Its  chemists  became  renowned  for  their  discoveries, 
and  by  1914  the  country  was  producing  half  the  world's  electri- 
cal equipment.  As  a  result  of  these  developments,  Germany 
became  the  continent's  industrial  giant. 

Germany's  population  also  expanded  rapidly,  growing  from 
41.0  million  in  1871  to  49.7  million  in  1891  and  65.3  million  in 
1911.  The  expanding  and  industrializing  economy  changed 
the  way  this  rapidly  expanding  population  earned  its  liveli- 
hood. In  1871  about  49  percent  of  the  workforce  was  engaged 
in  agriculture;  by  1907  only  35  percent  was.  In  the  same  period, 
industry's  share  of  the  rapidly  growing  workforce  rose  from  31 
percent  to  40  percent.  Urban  birth  rates  were  often  the  coun- 


44 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 


try's  highest,  but  there  was  much  migration  from  rural  areas  to 
urban  areas,  where  most  industry  was  located.  Berlin,  by  far  the 
country's  largest  city  and  a  major  industrial  center,  grew  from 
almost  1  million  inhabitants  in  1875  to  2  million  in  1910.  Many 
smaller  cities,  especially  those  in  areas  with  much  industry — 
such  as  the  Ruhr  region,  the  upper  Rhine  Valley,  the  Neckar 
Valley,  and  Saxony — tripled  or  quadrupled  in  size  during  this 
period. 

The  Tariff  Agreement  of  1 879  and  Its  Social  Consequences 

The  crash  of  1873  and  the  subsequent  depression  began  the 
gradual  dissolution  of  Bismarck's  alliance  with  the  National 
Liberals  that  had  begun  after  his  triumphs  of  1866.  In  the  late 
1870s,  Bismarck  began  negotiations  with  the  economically  pro- 
tectionist Conservative  Party  and  Center  Party  toward  the  for- 
mation of  a  new  government  coalition.  Conservative  electoral 
gains  and  National  Liberal  losses  in  1879  brought  a  conserva- 
tive coalition  to  power.  Bismarck  then  abandoned  his  former 
allies  in  the  National  Liberal  Party  and  put  in  place  a  system  of 
tariffs  that  benefited  the  landed  gentry  of  eastern  Prussia — 
threatened  by  imports  of  cheaper  grains  from  Russia  and  the 
United  States — and  industrialists  who  were  afraid  to  compete 
with  cheaper  foreign  manufactured  goods  and  who  believed 
they  needed  more  time  to  establish  themselves. 

Bismarck's  alliance  with  the  Prussian  landowning  class  and 
powerful  industrialists  and  the  parties  representing  their  inter- 
ests had  profound  social  effects.  From  that  point  on,  conserva- 
tive groups  had  the  upper  hand  in  German  society.  The 
German  middle  class  began  to  imitate  its  conservative  social 
superiors  rather  than  attempt  to  impose  its  own  liberal,  middle- 
class  values  on  Germany.  The  prestige  of  the  military  became 
so  great  that  many  middle-class  males  sought  to  enhance  their 
social  standing  by  becoming  officers  in  the  reserves.  The  mid- 
dle classes  also  became  more  susceptible  to  the  nationalistic 
clamor  for  colonies  and  "a  place  in  the  sun"  that  was  to  become 
ever  more  virulent  in  the  next  few  decades. 

Bismarck's  Foreign  Policy 

Bismarck  sincerely  regarded  the  new  German  Empire  as 
"satiated,"  that  is,  having  no  desire  to  expand  further  and 
hence  posing  no  threat  to  its  neighbors.  The  chancellor  held 
that  the  country  had  to  adjust  to  its  new  circumstances  and  that 
this  would  take  decades.  For  this  reason,  he  sought  to  convince 


45 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  other  European  states  of  Germany's  desire  to  live  in  peace, 
hoping  thereby  to  secure  Germany  against  attack.  He  aimed  to 
arrange  this  security  through  a  system  of  alliances.  Believing 
that  France  would  remain  Germany's  enemy  because  of  the 
annexation  of  Alsace-Lorraine,  an  action  he  had  opposed 
because  of  the  enmity  it  would  cause,  he  turned  to  other  states. 

Bismarck  arranged  an  alliance  with  Austria-Hungary  in  1879 
and  one  with  Italy  in  1882.  His  triumph,  however,  was  a  secret 
alliance  he  formed  by  means  of  the  Reinsurance  Treaty  with 
Russia  in  1887,  although  its  terms  violated  the  spirit  of  the 
treaty  with  Austria-Hungary.  However  much  these  agreements 
contributed  to  German  security,  Bismarck's  plunge  into  the 
European  scramble  for  overseas  colonies  ultimately  weakened 
it  by  awakening  British  fears  about  Germany's  long-term  geo- 
political aims.  Subsequent  feelers  he  put  out  with  a  view  to 
establishing  an  understanding  with  Britain  were  rebuffed.  In 
1890  Bismarck  was  dismissed  by  young  Kaiser  Wilhelm  over  a 
dispute  about  antisocialist  legislation. 

Foreign  Policy  in  the  Wilhelmine  Era 

Foreign  policy  in  the  Wilhelmine  Era  (1890-1914)  turned 
away  from  Bismarck's  cautious  diplomacy  of  the  1871-90 
period.  It  was  also  marked  by  a  shrill  aggressiveness.  Brusque, 
clumsy  diplomacy  was  backed  by  increased  armaments  produc- 
tion, most  notably  the  creation  of  a  large  fleet  of  battleships 
capable  of  challenging  the  British  navy.  This  new  bellicosity 
alarmed  the  rest  of  Europe,  and  by  about  1907  German  policy 
makers  had  succeeded  in  creating  Bismarck's  nightmare:  a  Ger- 
many "encircled"  by  an  alliance  of  hostile  neighbors — in  this 
case  Russia,  France,  and  Britain — in  an  alliance  called  the  Tri- 
ple Entente. 

The  first  brick  to  fall  out  of  Bismarck's  carefully  crafted  edi- 
fice was  Germany's  Reinsurance  Treaty  with  Russia.  Harmed  by 
Prussian  trade  policies,  Russia  did  not  renew  the  treaty  and 
instead  turned  to  France  for  economic  assistance  and  military 
security.  The  two  countries  formally  allied  in  early  1893.  Britain 
joined  them  in  1907,  even  though  France  and  Britain  had 
nearly  gone  to  war  over  a  colonial  dispute  in  1898.  Britain's 
main  reason  for  abandoning  its  usual  posture  as  an  aloof 
observer  of  developments  on  the  continent  was  Germany's 
plan  to  build  a  fleet  of  sixty  battleships  of  the  formidable 
Dreadnought  class.

Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

The  German  naval  expansion  program  had  many  domestic 
supporters.  The  kaiser  deeply  admired  the  navy  of  his  grand- 
mother, Queen  Victoria  of  Britain,  and  wanted  one  as  large  for 
himself.  Powerful  lobbying  groups  in  Germany  desired  a  large 
navy  to  give  Germany  a  worldwide  role  and  to  protect  a  grow- 
ing German  colonial  empire  in  Africa  and  the  Pacific.  Industry 
wanted  large  government  contracts.  Some  political  parties  pro- 
moted naval  expansion  and  an  aggressive  foreign  policy  to  win 
votes  from  a  nervous  electorate  they  kept  worked  up  with  jingo- 
istic rhetoric. 

The  chief  figure  in  promoting  the  naval  buildup  was  Admi- 
ral Alfred  von  Tirpitz,  who  is  considered  the  founder  of  the 
modern  German  navy.  Tirpitz  was  an  effective  spokesman  for 
the  program  and  had  the  ear  of  the  kaiser  and  his  advisers.  In 
1898,  after  the  Reichstag  passed  the  first  Naval  Bill,  Anglo-Ger- 
man relations  deteriorated.  The  Supplementary  Naval  Act  of 
1900  further  strained  relations  with  Britain,  as  did  a  proposed 
Berlin-Baghdad  railroad  through  the  Ottoman  Empire,  a 
project  that  threatened  British  as  well  as  Russian  interests  in 
the  Balkans.  Two  crises  over  Morocco,  in  1905  and  1911,  drove 
France  and  Britain  closer  together  and  made  for  a  tense  inter- 
national atmosphere.  The  great  powers  remained  neutral  dur- 
ing the  Balkan  Wars  (1912-13),  a  nationalist  rebellion  against 
Ottoman  rule,  but  European  tensions  were  increased  still  fur- 
ther, and  the  expectation  that  there  would  eventually  be  war  on 
the  continent  became  more  certain. 

The  assassination  of  Archduke  Franz  Ferdinand  in  Sarajevo 
on  June  28,  1914,  set  off  a  series  of  diplomatic  and  military 
decisions  that  would  end  peace  in  Europe.  The  kaiser  gave  a  so- 
called  blank  check  to  his  ally,  Austria-Hungary,  saying  that  Ger- 
many would  support  any  Habsburg  measure  taken  against  Ser- 
bia, which  had  backed  the  assassination.  Austria-Hungary's 
ultimatum  to  Serbia  in  late  July  was  so  harsh  that  war  became 
inevitable.  Within  days,  a  set  of  interlocking  alliances  had 
Europe's  great  powers  embroiled  in  what  would  become  World 
War  I. 

World  War  I 

Germany's  leadership  had  hoped  for  a  limited  war  between 
Austria-Hungary  and  Serbia.  But  because  Russian  forces  had 
been  mobilized  in  support  of  Serbia,  the  German  leadership 
made  the  decision  to  support  its  ally.  The  Schlieffen  Plan, 
based  on  the  assumption  that  Germany  would  face  a  two-front 


47 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

war  because  of  a  French-Russian  alliance,  required  a  rapid  inva- 
sion through  neutral  Belgium  to  ensure  the  quick  defeat  of 
France.  Once  the  western  front  was  secure,  the  bulk  of  German 
forces  could  attack  and  defeat  Russia,  which  would  not  yet  be 
completely  ready  for  war  because  it  would  mobilize  its  gigantic 
forces  slowly. 

Despite  initial  successes,  Germany's  strategy  failed,  and  its 
troops  became  tied  down  in  trench  warfare  in  France.  For  the 
next  four  years,  there  would  be  little  progress  in  the  west, 
where  advances  were  usually  measured  in  meters  rather  than  in 
kilometers.  Under  the  command  of  Paul  von  Hindenburg  and 
Erich  Ludendorff,  the  army  scored  a  number  of  significant  vic- 
tories against  Russia.  But  it  was  only  in  early  1918  that  Russia 
was  defeated.  Even  after  this  victory  in  the  east,  however,  Ger- 
many remained  mired  in  a  long  war  for  which  it  had  not  pre- 
pared. 

Germany's  war  aims  were  annexationist  in  nature  and  fore- 
saw an  enlarged  Germany,  with  Belgium  and  Poland  as  vassal 
states  and  with  colonies  in  Africa.  In  its  first  years,  there  was 
widespread  support  for  the  war.  Even  the  SPD  supported  it, 
considering  it  a  defensive  effort  and  voting  in  favor  of  war  cred- 
its. By  1916,  however,  opposition  to  the  war  had  mounted 
within  the  general  population,  which  had  to  endure  many 
hardships,  including  food  shortages.  A  growing  number  of 
Reichstag  deputies  came  to  demand  a  peace  without  annex- 
ations. Frustrated  in  its  quest  for  peace,  in  April  1917  a  seg- 
ment of  the  SPD  broke  with  the  party  and  formed  the 
Independent  Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany.  In  July  the 
Reichstag  passed  a  resolution  calling  for  a  peace  without 
annexations.  In  its  wake,  Chancellor  Theobald  von  Bethmann 
Hollweg  was  forced  to  resign,  and  Hindenburg  and  Luden- 
dorff came  to  exercise  a  control  over  Germany  until  late  1918 
that  amounted  to  a  virtual  military  dictatorship. 

Military  leaders  refused  a  moderate  peace  because  they  were 
convinced  until  very  late  in  the  war  that  victory  ultimately 
would  be  theirs.  Another  reason  for  their  insistence  on  a  settle- 
ment that  fulfilled  expansionist  aims  was  that  the  government 
had  not  financed  the  war  with  higher  taxes  but  with  bonds. 
Taxes  had  been  seen  as  unnecessary  because  it  was  expected 
that  the  government  would  redeem  these  bonds  after  the  war 
with  payments  from  Germany's  vanquished  enemies.  Thus, 
only  an  expansionist  victory  would  keep  the  state  solvent  and 
save  millions  of  German  bondholders  from  financial  ruin.

Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

After  the  Bolshevik  Revolution  of  November  1917,  Russia 
and  Germany  began  peace  negotiations.  In  March  1918,  the 
two  countries  signed  the  Treaty  of  Brest-Litovsk.  The  defeat  of 
Russia  enabled  Germany  to  transfer  troops  from  the  eastern  to 
the  western  front.  Two  large  offensives  in  the  west  were  met  by 
an  Allied  counteroffensive  that  began  in  July.  German  troops 
were  pressed  back,  and  it  became  evident  to  many  officers  that 
Germany  could  not  win  the  war.  In  September  Ludendorff  rec- 
ommended that  Germany  sue  for  peace.  In  October  extensive 
reforms  democratized  the  Reichstag  and  gave  Germany  a  con- 
stitutional monarchy.  A  coalition  of  progressive  forces  was 
formed,  headed  by  SPD  politician  Friedrich  Ebert.  The  mili- 
tary allowed  the  birth  of  a  democratic  parliament  because  it 
did  not  want  to  be  held  responsible  for  the  inevitable  armistice 
that  would  end  the  war  on  terms  highly  unfavorable  to  Ger- 
many. Instead,  the  civilian  government  that  signed  the  truce 
was  to  take  the  blame  for  the  nation's  defeat. 

The  political  reforms  of  October  were  overshadowed  by  a 
popular  uprising  that  began  on  November  3  when  sailors  in 
Kiel  mutinied.  They  refused  to  go  out  on  what  they  considered 
a  suicide  mission  against  British  naval  forces.  The  revolt  grew 
quickly  and  within  a  week  appeared  to  be  burgeoning  into  a 
revolution  that  could  well  overthrow  the  established  social 
order.  On  November  9,  the  kaiser  was  forced  to  abdicate,  and 
the  SPD  proclaimed  a  republic.  A  provisional  government 
headed  by  Ebert  promised  elections  for  a  national  assembly  to 
draft  a  new  constitution.  In  an  attempt  to  control  the  popular 
uprising,  Ebert  agreed  to  back  the  army  if  it  would  suppress  the 
revolt.  On  November  11,  the  government  signed  the  armistice 
that  ended  the  war.  Germany's  loses  included  about  1.6  million 
dead  and  more  than  4  million  wounded. 

Signed  in  June  1919,  the  Treaty  of  Versailles  limited  Ger- 
many to  an  army  of  100,000  soldiers.  The  treaty  also  stipulated 
that  the  Rhineland  be  demilitarized  and  occupied  by  the  west- 
ern Allies  for  fifteen  years  and  that  Germany  surrender  Alsace- 
Lorraine,  northern  Schleswig-Holstein,  a  portion  of  western 
Prussia  that  became  known  as  the  Polish  Corridor  because  it 
gave  Poland  access  to  the  Baltic,  and  all  overseas  colonies.  Also, 
an  Allied  Reparations  Commission  was  established  and 
charged  with  setting  the  amount  of  war-damage  payments  that 
would  be  demanded  of  Germany.  The  treaty  also  included  the 
"war  guilt  clause,"  ascribing  responsibility  for  World  War  I  to 
Germany  and  Austria-Hungary.

The  Weimar  Republic,  1918-33 

The  Weimar  Constitution 

The  Weimar  Republic,  proclaimed  on  November  9,  1918, 
was  born  in  the  throes  of  military  defeat  and  social  revolution. 
In  January  1919,  a  National  Assembly  was  elected  to  draft  a 
constitution.  The  government,  composed  of  members  from 
the  assembly,  came  to  be  called  the  Weimar  coalition  and 
included  the  SPD;  the  German  Democratic  Party  (Deutsche 
Demokratische  Partei — DDP),  a  descendant  of  the  Progressive 
Party  of  the  prewar  period;  and  the  Center  Party.  The  percent- 
age of  the  vote  gained  by  this  coalition  of  parties  in  favor  of  the 
republic  (76.2  percent,  with  38  percent  for  the  SPD  alone)  sug- 
gested broad  popular  support  for  the  republic.  The  antirepub- 
lican,  conservative  German  National  People's  Party 
(Deutschnationale  Volkspartei — DNVP)  and  the  German  Peo- 
ple's Party  (Deutsche  Volkspartei — DVP)  received  a  combined 
total  of  10.3  percent  of  the  vote.  The  Independent  Social  Dem- 
ocratic Party  of  Germany,  which  had  split  from  the  SPD  during 
the  war,  won  8  percent  of  the  vote.  In  February  the  assembly 
elected  Friedrich  Ebert  as  the  republic's  first  president. 

In  mid-1919  the  assembly  ratified  the  constitution  of  the  new 
Weimar  Republic,  so  named  because  its  constitution  was 
drafted  in  the  small  city  where  the  poets  Goethe  and  Schiller 
had  lived.  The  constitution  established  a  federal  republic  con- 
sisting of  nineteen  states  (Lander,  sing.,  Land)  (see  fig.  5).  The 
republic's  government  was  a  mixed  strong  president  and  parlia- 
mentary system,  with  the  president  seen  by  many  as  a  sort  of 
substitute  kaiser.  The  president  was  elected  by  popular  direct 
ballot  to  a  seven-year  term  and  could  be  reelected.  He 
appointed  the  chancellor  and,  pursuant  to  the  chancellor's 
nominations,  also  appointed  the  cabinet  ministers.  However, 
the  cabinet  had  to  reflect  the  party  composition  of  the  Reichs- 
tag and  was  also  responsible  to  this  body.  Election  to  the 
Reichstag  was  by  secret  ballot  and  popular  vote.  Suffrage  was 
universal.  Thus,  Germany  had  a  truly  democratic  parliamen- 
tary system.  However,  the  president  had  the  right  to  dismiss  the 
cabinet,  dissolve  the  Reichstag,  and  veto  legislation.  The  legis- 
lative powers  of  the  Reichstag  were  further  weakened  by  the 
provision  for  presidential  recourse  to  popular  plebiscite.  Arti- 
cle 48,  the  so-called  emergency  clause,  accorded  the  president 
the  right  to  allow  the  cabinet  to  govern  without  the  consent  of

parliament  whenever  it  was  deemed  essential  to  maintaining 
public  order. 

Problems  of  Parliamentary  Politics 

The  Weimar  Republic  was  beset  with  serious  problems  from 
the  outset  that  led  many  Germans  either  to  withhold  support 
from  the  new  parliamentary  democracy  or  to  seek  actively  to 
destroy  it.  The  extreme  left  and  much  of  the  right  provided  the 
republic's  most  vitriolic  opponents.  Its  supporters  included  the 
bulk  of  the  left,  represented  by  the  SPD,  and  the  moderate 
right,  made  up  of  the  Center  Party  and  the  DDP.  However,  at 
key  times  these  supporters  failed  to  behave  responsibly  because 
of  political  inexperience,  narrow  self-interest,  or  unrealistic 
party  programs. 

The  most  serious  obstacle  the  new  republic  faced  was  the 
refusal  of  many  Germans  to  accept  its  legitimacy.  The  extreme 
left  regarded  it  as  an  instrument  of  the  propertied  to  prevent 
revolution,  recalling  Ebert's  agreement  with  the  military  in 
November  1918  that  resulted  in  the  army's  bloody  suppression 
of  the  left-wing  revolts  of  late  1918  and  early  1919.  In  the  face 
of  this  SPD-military  alliance,  elements  of  the  left  considered 
the  SPD  as  great  a  barrier  to  their  goals  as  the  conservatives. 
Represented  by  the  Communist  Party  of  Germany  (Kommunis- 
tische  Partei  Deutschlands — KPD),  the  extreme  left  felt  such 
an  enduring  hostility  to  the  Weimar  Republic  that  at  times  it 
cooperated  with  the  extreme  right  in  efforts  to  destroy  the 
republic. 

The  right  posed  a  graver  threat  to  the  Weimar  Republic  than 
did  the  extreme  left  because  it  enjoyed  the  support  of  most  of 
Germany's  establishment:  the  military,  the  financial  elites,  the 
state  bureaucracy,  the  educational  system,  and  much  of  the 
press.  Unlike  political  parties  in  well-established  democracies, 
the  right-wing  parties  in  the  Reichstag  could  not  be  considered 
a  loyal  opposition  because  their  ultimate  aim  was  to  abolish  the 
new  system  of  government.  The  right  opposed  democracy  and 
desired  to  establish  a  conservative  authoritarian  regime.  The 
right  styled  those  who  were  party  to  the  armistice  and  to  the 
Treaty  of  Versailles  as  "November  criminals"  because  of  Ger- 
many's loss  of  territory  and  sovereignty  and  the  burden  of 
enormous  war  reparations.  The  increasing  acceptance  by  many 
of  the  "stab  in  the  back"  legend,  which  attributed  Germany's 
defeat  in  World  War  I  to  the  treachery  of  the  SPD  and  others 
on  the  left  rather  than  to  the  military  might  of  the  Allies,  inten-

sified  the  hatred  many  rightists  felt  toward  the  republic.  Like 
some  on  the  extreme  left,  many  on  the  right  used  violence, 
either  petty  and  random  or  large-scale  and  concerted,  to  attain 
their  ends.  Throughout  the  short  life  of  the  Weimar  Republic, 
various  political  groups  maintained  gangs  of  youths  organized 
into  paramilitary  forces. 

In  addition  to  venomous  political  opposition,  the  republic 
had  to  contend  with  a  weak  economy  plagued  by  high  rates  of 
inflation  and  unemployment.  Inflation  was  fueled  partly  by  the 
enormous  wartime  debts  the  imperial  government  had  con- 
tracted rather  than  raise  taxes  to  finance  the  war.  Even  more 
inflationary  were  the  enormous  war  reparations  demanded  by 
the  Allies,  which  made  economic  recovery  seem  impossible  to 
many  objective  expert  observers.  Inflation  ruined  many  mid- 
dle-class Germans,  who  saw  their  savings  and  pensions  wiped 
out.  Unemployment  also  remained  epidemic  throughout  the 
1920s,  hurting  millions  of  wage  earners  and  their  families. 
Their  economic  misery  made  these  groups  susceptible  to  the 
claims  of  extremist  political  parties. 

The  pervasive  social  and  political  discontent  growing  out  of 
Germans'  grievances,  justified  or  not,  soon  had  consequences. 
A  right-wing  coup  d'etat  in  March  1920,  the  Kapp  Putsch — 
named  for  its  leader,  Wolfgang  Kapp — failed  only  because  of  a 
general  strike. The  military  had  refused  to  intervene,  although 
it  did  brutally  suppress  some  Communist-inspired  uprisings 
shortly  thereafter.  The  establishment's  tacit  support  of  unlawful 
right-wing  actions  such  as  the  Kapp  Putsch  and  violent  repres- 
sion of  the  left  endured  to  the  end  of  the  Weimar  Republic. 
This  support  could  also  be  seen  in  the  sentences  meted  out  by 
the  courts  to  perpetrators  of  political  violence.  Right-wing  ter- 
rorists usually  received  mild  or  negligible  sentences,  while 
those  on  the  left  were  dealt  with  severely,  even  though  left-wing 
violence  was  but  a  fraction  of  that  committed  by  the  right. 

Dissatisfaction  with  the  republic  was  also  evident  in  the  June 
1920  elections,  in  which  the  Weimar  coalition  lost  its  majority. 
A  combined  total  vote  of  28.9  percent  for  the  DNVP,  a  descen- 
dant of  the  prewar  Conservatives,  and  the  DVP,  composed 
mainly  of  National  Liberals,  reflected  German  middle-class  dis- 
illusionment with  democracy.  Both  parties  wished  to  abolish 
the  Weimar  constitution.  SPD  strength  fell  to  21. V  percent,  as 
some  workers  defected  to  the  extreme  left.  The  Independent 
Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany,  formed  during  the  war, 
effectively  ceased  to  exist  as  some  members  joined  the  KPD, 


54

formed  in  December  1918,  and  the  remainder  reunited  with 
the  SPD. 

The  Weimar  coalition  never  regained  its  majority.  Because 
no  party  ever  gained  as  much  as  50  percent  of  the  vote,  unsta- 
ble coalition  governments  became  the  rule  in  the  1920s,  and  by 
the  end  of  the  decade  more  than  a  dozen  governments  had 
been  formed,  none  capable  of  unified  action  on  major  prob- 
lems. The  SPD  and  the  Center  Party  often  could  agree  on  ques- 
tions of  foreign  policy,  such  as  compliance  with  the  provisions 
of  the  Treaty  of  Versailles,  but  split  on  domestic  issues.  Con- 
versely, the  Center  Party  agreed  with  parties  to  its  right  on 
domestic  issues  but  split  with  them  on  foreign  policy.  Thus, 
minority  governments  were  formed  that  often  showed  little 
internal  coherence  during  their  brief  lives. 

The  year  1923  was  one  of  crisis  for  the  republic.  In  January 
French  and  Belgian  troops  occupied  the  highly  industrialized 
Ruhr  area  because  of  German  defaults  on  reparations  pay- 
ments. The  Weimar  government  responded  by  calling  upon 
the  Ruhr  population  to  stop  all  industrial  activity.  The  govern- 
ment also  began  printing  money  at  such  a  rate  that  it  soon 
became  virtually  worthless;  by  the  fall  of  1923,  wheelbarrows 
were  needed  to  carry  enough  currency  for  simple  purchases  as 
inflation  reached  rates  beyond  comprehension.  In  1914  US$1 
had  equaled  4  marks.  By  mid-1920,  US$1  was  worth  40  marks, 
by  early  1922  about  200  marks,  a  year  later  18,000  marks,  and 
by  November  1923  4.2  trillion  marks.  In  addition,  the  country 
was  racked  by  strikes,  paramilitary  street  violence,  and  rumors 
of  planned  uprisings  by  both  the  left  and  the  right.  In  August, 
in  the  midst  of  this  chaos,  President  Ebert  asked  Gustav  Strese- 
mann,  head  of  the  DVP,  to  form  a  new  government  to  resolve 
the  crisis. 

The  Stresemann  Era 

Stresemann  was  a  Vernunftrepublikaner,  that  is,  someone  who 
supported  the  Weimar  Republic  because  it  seemed  the  best 
course  of  action  rather  than  from  a  firm  commitment  to  parlia- 
mentary democracy.  During  the  war,  Stresemann  had  sup- 
ported imperial  aims  and  desired  extensive  annexation  of 
foreign  territory.  After  the  war,  he  remained  a  monarchist  and 
founded  the  DVP  to  oppose  the  republic.  In  early  1920,  he 
wished  for  the  success  of  the  Kapp  Putsch.  However,  shocked 
by  the  assassinations  of  several  prominent  politicians,  he  had 
gradually  come  to  believe  that  the  effective  functioning  of  the 


55 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Weimar  Republic  was  the  best  safeguard  against  violent 
regimes  of  either  the  left  or  the  right.  He  also  became  con- 
vinced that  Germany's  economic  problems  and  differences 
with  other  countries  could  best  be  resolved  through  negotiated 
agreements. 

Chancellor  only  from  August  to  November  1923,  Strese- 
mann  headed  the  "great  coalition, 11  an  alliance  that  included 
the  SPD,  the  Center  Party,  the  DDP,  and  the  DVP.  In  this  brief 
period,  he  ended  passive  resistance  in  the  Ruhr  area  and  intro- 
duced measures  to  bring  the  currency  situation  under  control. 
Because  of  the  failure  of  several  coup  attempts — including  one 
by  Adolf  Hitler  in  Munich — and  a  general  quieting  of  the 
atmosphere  after  these  problems  had  been  solved,  the  Weimar 
Republic  was  granted  a  period  of  relative  tranquillity  that  lasted 
until  the  end  of  the  decade.  Overriding  issues  were  by  no 
means  settled,  but,  for  a  few  years,  the  republic  functioned 
more  like  an  established  democracy. 

After  his  resignation  from  the  chancellorship  because  of 
opposition  from  the  right  and  left,  Stresemann  served  as  Ger- 
man foreign  minister  until  his  death  in  1929.  A  brilliant  negoti- 
ator and  a  shrewd  diplomat,  Stresemann  arranged  a 
rapprochement  with  the  Allies.  Reparations  payments  were 
made  easier  by  the  Reichstag's  acceptance  in  mid-1924  of  the 
Dawes  Plan,  which  had  been  devised  by  an  American  banker, 
Charles  G.  Dawes,  to  effect  significant  reductions  in  payments 
until  1929.  That  year,  only  months  before  his  death,  Strese- 
mann negotiated  a  further  reduction  as  part  of  the  Young  Plan, 
also  named  for  an  American  banker,  Owen  D.  Young.  The 
Dawes  Plan  had  also  provided  for  the  withdrawal  of  French  and 
Belgian  troops  from  the  Ruhr  district,  which  was  completed  in 
1925.  In  addition,  beginning  in  the  mid-1920s,  loans  from  the 
United  States  stimulated  the  German  economy,  instigating  a 
period  of  growth  that  lasted  until  1930. 

The  Locarno  treaties,  signed  in  1925  by  Germany  and  the 
Allies,  were  the  centerpiece  of  Stresemann's  attempt  at  rap- 
prochement with  the  West.  A  prerequisite  to  Germany's  admis- 
sion to  the  League  of  Nations  in  1926,  the  treaties  formalized 
German  acceptance  of  the  demilitarization  of  the  Rhineland 
and  guaranteed  the  western  frontier  as  defined  by  the  Treaty  of 
Versailles.  Both  Britain  and  Germany  preferred  to  leave  the 
question  of  the  eastern  frontier  open.  In  1926  the  German  and 
Soviet  governments  signed  the  Treaty  of  Berlin,  which  pledged 


56 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

Germany  and  the  Soviet  Union  to  neutrality  in  the  event  of  an 
attack  on  either  country  by  foreign  powers. 

The  Locarno  treaties,  the  Treaty  of  Berlin,  and  Germany's 
membership  in  the  League  of  Nations  were  successes  that 
earned  Stresemann  world  renown.  Within  Germany,  however, 
these  achievements  were  condemned  by  many  on  the  right 
who  charged  that  these  agreements  implied  German  recogni- 
tion of  the  validity  of  the  Treaty  of  Versailles.  To  them,  Strese- 
mann's  diplomacy,  as  able  as  Bismarck's  in  the  opinion  of  some 
historians,  was  tantamount  to  treachery  because  Germany  was 
honor  bound  to  take  by  force  that  which  the  rightists  felt  was 
owed  it.  Because  of  these  opinions  and  continued  dissatisfac- 
tion on  the  right  with  the  political  system  established  by  the 
Weimar  Constitution,  the  Center  Party  and  the  parties  to  its 
right  became  more  right-wing  during  the  latter  1920s,  as  did 
even  Stresemann's  own  party,  the  DVP. 

Hitler  and  the  Rise  of  National  Socialism 

Adolf  Hitler  was  born  in  the  Austrian  border  town  of 
Braunau  am  Inn  in  1889.  When  he  was  seventeen,  he  was 
refused  admission  to  the  Vienna  Art  Academy,  having  been 
found  insufficiently  talented.  He  remained  in  Vienna,  however, 
where  he  led  a  bohemian  existence,  acquiring  an  ideology 
based  on  belief  in  a  German  master  race  that  was  threatened  by 
an  international  Jewish  conspiracy  responsible  for  many  of  the 
world's  problems.  Hitler  remained  in  Vienna  until  1913,  when 
he  moved  to  Munich.  After  serving  with  bravery  in  the  German 
army  during  World  War  I,  he  joined  the  right-wing  Bavarian 
German  Workers'  Party  in  1919.  The  following  year,  the  party 
changed  its  name  to  the  National  Socialist  German  Workers' 
Party  (National-Sozialistische  Deutsche  Arbeiterpartei — 
NSDAP).  Its  members  were  known  as  Nazis,  a  term  derived 
from  the  German  pronunciation  of  "National."  In  1921  Hitler 
assumed  leadership  of  the  NSDAP. 

As  leader  of  the  NSDAP,  Hitler  reorganized  the  party  and 
encouraged  the  assimilation  of  other  radical  right-wing  groups. 
Gangs  of  unemployed  demobilized  soldiers  were  gathered 
under  the  command  of  a  former  army  officer,  Ernst  Rohm,  to 
form  the  Storm  Troops  (Sturmabteilung — SA),  Hitler's  private 
army.  Under  Hitler's  leadership,  the  NSDAP  joined  with  others 
on  the  right  in  denouncing  the  Weimar  Republic  and  the 
"November  criminals"  who  had  signed  the  Treaty  of  Versailles. 
The  postwar  economic  slump  won  the  party  a  following  among 


57 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

unemployed  ex-soldiers,  the  lower  middle  class,  and  small 
farmers;  in  1923  membership  totaled  about  55,000.  General 
Ludendorff  supported  the  former  corporal  in  the  Beer  Hall 
Putsch  of  November  1923  in  Munich,  an  attempt  to  overthrow 
the  Bavarian  government.  The  putsch  failed,  and  Hitler 
received  a  light  sentence  of  five  years,  of  which  he  served  less 
than  one.  Incarcerated  in  relative  comfort,  he  wrote  Mein 
Kampf  (My  Struggle),  in  which  he  set  out  his  long-term  political 
aims. 

After  the  failure  of  the  putsch,  Hitler  turned  to  "legal  revolu- 
tion" as  the  means  to  power  and  chose  two  parallel  paths  to 
take  the  Nazis  to  that  goal.  First,  the  NSDAP  would  employ  pro- 
paganda to  create  a  national  mass  party  capable  of  coming  to 
power  through  electoral  successes.  Second,  the  party  would 
develop  a  bureaucratic  structure  and  prepare  itself  to  assume 
roles  in  government.  Beginning  in  the  mid-1920s,  Nazi  groups 
sprang  up  in  other  parts  of  Germany.  In  1927  the  NSDAP  orga- 
nized the  first  Nuremberg  party  congress,  a  mass  political  rally. 
By  1928  party  membership  exceeded  100,000;  the  Nazis,  how- 
ever, polled  only  2.6  percent  of  the  vote  in  the  Reichstag  elec- 
tions in  May. 

A  mere  splinter  party  in  1928,  the  NSDAP  became  better 
known  the  following  year  when  it  formed  an  alliance  with  the 
DNVP  to  launch  a  plebiscite  against  the  Young  Plan  on  the 
issue  of  reparations.  The  DNVP's  leader,  Alfred  Hugenberg, 
owner  of  a  large  newspaper  chain,  considered  Hitler's  spell- 
binding oratory  a  useful  means  of  attracting  votes.  The  DNVP- 
NSDAP  union  brought  the  NSDAP  within  the  framework  of  a 
socially  influential  coalition  of  the  antirepublican  right.  As  a 
result,  Hitler's  party  acquired  respectability  and  access  to 
wealthy  contributors. 

Had  it  not  been  for  the  economic  collapse  that  began  with 
the  Wall  Street  stock  market  crash  of  October  1929,  Hitler 
probably  would  not  have  come  to  power.  The  Great  Depression 
hit  Germany  hard  because  the  German  economy's  well-being 
depended  on  short-term  loans  from  the  United  States.  Once 
these  loans  were  recalled,  Germany  was  devastated.  Unemploy- 
ment went  from  8.5  percent  in  1929  to  14  percent  in  1930,  to 
21.9  percent  in  1931,  and,  at  its  peak,  to  29.9  percent  in  1932. 
Compounding  the  effects  of  the  Depression  were  the  drastic 
economic  measures  taken  by  Center  Party  politician  Heinrich 
Bruning,  who  served  as  chancellor  from  March  1930  until  the 
end  of  May  1932.  Bruning's  budget  cuts  were  designed  to  cause 


58 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

so  much  misery  that  the  Allies  would  excuse  Germany  from 
making  any  further  reparations  payments.  In  this  at  least,  Brun- 
ing  succeeded.  United  States  president  Herbert  Hoover 
declared  a  "reparations  moratorium"  in  1932.  In  the  mean- 
time, the  Depression  deepened,  and  social  discontent  intensi- 
fied to  the  point  that  Germany  seemed  on  the  verge  of  civil 
war. 

In  times  of  desperation,  voters  are  ready  for  extreme  solu- 
tions, and  the  NSDAP  exploited  the  situation.  Skilled  Nazi  pro- 
pagandist Joseph  Goebbels  launched  an  intensive  media 
campaign  that  ceaselessly  expounded  a  few  simple  notions 
until  even  the  dullest  voter  knew  Hitler's  basic  program.  The 
party's  program  was  broad  and  general  enough  to  appeal  to 
many  unemployed  people,  farmers,  white-collar  workers,  mem- 
bers of  the  middle  class  who  had  been  hurt  by  the  Depression 
or  had  lost  status  since  the  end  of  World  War  I,  and  young  peo- 
ple eager  to  dedicate  themselves  to  nationalist  ideals.  If  voters 
were  not  drawn  to  some  aspects  of  the  party  platform,  they 
might  agree  with  others.  Like  other  right-wing  groups,  the 
party  blamed  the  Treaty  of  Versailles  and  reparations  for  the 
developing  crisis.  Nazi  propaganda  attacked  the  Weimar  politi- 
cal system,  the  "November  criminals,"  Marxists,  international- 
ists, and  Jews.  Besides  promising  a  solution  to  the  economic 
crisis,  the  NSDAP  offered  the  German  people  a  sense  of 
national  pride  and  the  promise  of  restored  order. 

Three  elections — in  September  1930,  in  July  1932,  and  in 
November  1932 — were  held  between  the  onset  of  the  Depres- 
sion and  Hitler's  appointment  as  chancellor  in  January  1933. 
The  vote  shares  of  the  SPD  and  the  Center  Party  fluctuated 
somewhat  yet  remained  much  as  they  had  been  in  1928,  when 
the  SPD  held  a  large  plurality  of  153  seats  in  the  Reichstag  and 
the  Center  Party  held  sixty-one,  third  after  the  DNVP's  seventy- 
three  seats.  The  shares  of  the  parties  of  the  extreme  left  and 
extreme  right,  the  KPD  and  the  NSDAP,  respectively,  increased 
dramatically  in  this  period,  KPD  holdings  almost  doubling 
from  fifty-four  in  1928  to  100  in  November  1932.  The  NSDAP's 
success  was  even  greater.  Beginning  with  twelve  seats  in  1928, 
the  Nazis  increased  their  delegation  seats  nearly  tenfold,  to  107 
seats  in  1930.  They  doubled  their  holdings  to  230  in  the  sum- 
mer of  1932.  This  made  the  NSDAP  the  largest  party  in  the 
Reichstag,  far  surpassing  the  SPD  with  its  133  seats.  The  gains 
of  the  NSDAP  came  at  the  expense  of  the  other  right-wing  par- 
ties.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Chancellor  Bruning  was  unable  to  secure  parliamentary 
majorities  for  his  austerity  policy,  so  he  ruled  by  decree,  a  right 
given  him  by  President  Hindenburg.  Head  of  the  German 
army  during  World  War  I,  Hindenburg  had  been  elected  presi- 
dent in  1925.  Ruling  without  parliament  was  a  major  step  in 
moving  away  from  parliamentary  democracy  and  had  the 
approval  of  many  on  the  right.  Many  historians  see  this  devel- 
opment as  part  of  a  strategic  plan  formulated  at  the  time  by 
elements  of  the  conservative  establishment  to  abolish  the 
republic  and  replace  it  with  an  authoritarian  regime. 

By  late  May  1932,  Hindenburg  had  found  Bruning  insuffi- 
ciently pliable  and  named  a  more  conservative  politician,  Franz 
von  Papen,  as  his  successor.  After  the  mid-1932  elections  that 
made  the  NSDAP  Germany's  largest  party,  Papen  sought  to  har- 
ness Hitler  for  the  purposes  of  traditional  conservatives  by 
offering  him  the  post  of  vice  chancellor  in  a  new  cabinet.  Hit- 
ler refused  this  offer,  demanding  the  chancellorship  instead. 

General  Kurt  von  Schleicher,  a  master  intriguer  and  a  leader 
of  the  conservative  campaign  to  abolish  the  republic,  con- 
vinced Hindenburg  to  dismiss  Papen.  Schleicher  formed  a  new 
government  in  December  but  lost  Hindenburg's  support 
within  a  month.  On  January  30,  1933,  Papen  again  put 
together  a  cabinet,  this  time  with  Hitler  as  chancellor.  Papen 
and  other  conservatives  thought  they  could  tame  Hitler  by 
tying  him  down  with  the  responsibilities  of  government  and 
transferring  to  themselves  his  tremendous  popularity  with  a 
large  portion  of  the  electorate.  But  they  proved  no  match  for 
his  ruthlessness  and  his  genius  at  knowing  how — and  when — to 
seize  power.  Within  two  months,  Hitler  had  dictatorial  control 
over  Germany. 

The  Third  Reich,  1933-45 

The  Consolidation  of  Power 

Hitler  rapidly  transformed  the  Weimar  Republic  into  a  dicta- 
torship. The  National  Socialists  accomplished  their  "revolu- 
tion" within  months,  using  a  combination  of  legal  procedure, 
persuasion,  and  terror.  Because  the  parties  forming  the  cabinet 
did  not  have  a  parliamentary  majority,  Hindenburg  called  for 
the  dissolution  of  the  Reichstag  and  set  March  5,  1933,  as  the 
date  for  new  elections.  A  week  before  election  day,  the  Reichs- 
tag building  was  destroyed  by  fire.  The  Nazis  blamed  the  fire 
on  the  Communists,  and  on  February  28  the  president,  invok- 


60 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 

ing  Article  48  of  the  constitution,  signed  a  decree  that  granted 
the  Nazis  the  right  to  quash  the  political  opposition.  Autho- 
rized by  the  decree,  the  SA  arrested  or  intimidated  Socialists 
and  Communists. 

The  election  of  March  5  was  the  last  held  in  Germany  until 
after  World  War  II.  Although  opposition  parties  were  severely 
harassed,  the  NSDAP  won  only  43.9  percent  of  the  vote.  None- 
theless, with  the  help  of  political  allies,  Hitler  presented  the 
Reichstag  with  the  proposal  for  an  Enabling  Act  that,  if  passed 
by  a  two-thirds  majority,  would  allow  him  to  govern  without 
parliament  for  four  years.  On  March  23,  the  proposal  was 
passed  with  the  support  of  the  Center  Party  and  others.  All 
Communists  and  some  Social  Democrats  were  prevented  from 
voting. 

Hitler  used  the  Enabling  Act  to  implement  Gleichschaltung 
(synchronization),  that  is,  the  policy  of  subordinating  all  insti- 
tutions and  organizations  to  Nazi  control.  First,  left-wing  politi- 
cal parties  were  banned;  then,  in  July  1933,  Germany  was 
declared  a  one-party  state.  The  civil  service  and  judiciary  were 
purged  of  "non-Aryans"  (Jews)  and  leftists.  Local  and  state  gov- 
ernments were  reorganized  and  staffed  with  Nazis.  Trade 
unions  were  dissolved  and  replaced  with  Nazi  organizations. 
Even  the  NSDAP  was  purged  of  its  social-revolutionary  wing, 
the  SA.  The  enormous  and  unruly  SA  was  brought  under  con- 
trol by  a  massacre  of  its  leadership  at  the  end  of  June  1934  in 
the  "night  of  the  long  knives."  Other  opponents  were  also 
killed  during  this  purge,  among  them  Schleicher.  After  Hin- 
denburg's  death  in  early  August  1934,  Hitler  combined  the 
offices  of  the  president  and  the  chancellor.  With  the  SA  tamed, 
Hitler  assured  the  army  that  he  regarded  it  as  Germany's  mili- 
tary force,  and  the  soldiers  swore  an  oath  of  personal  alle- 
giance to  Hitler,  pledging  unconditional  obedience.  Heinrich 
Himmler's  Guard  Detachment  (Schutz-Staffel — SS)  replaced 
the  SA  as  Hitler's  private  army. 

Once  the  regime  was  established,  terror  was  the  principal 
means  used  to  maintain  its  control  of  Germany.  Police  arrests, 
which  had  focused  originally  on  Communists  and  Socialists, 
were  extended  to  other  groups,  most  particularly  to  Jews.  This 
systematic  use  of  terror  was  highly  effective  in  silencing  resis- 
tance. Some  enemies  of  the  regime  fled  abroad.  However,  all 
but  a  tiny  minority  of  those  opposed  to  Hitler  resigned  them- 
selves to  suppressing  their  opinions  in  public  and  hoping  for 
the  regime's  eventual  demise.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Like  its  secular  institutions,  Germany's  churches  were  sub- 
jected to  Nazi  pressure.  They  resisted  incorporation  into  the 
regime  and  retained  a  substantial  degree  of  independence. 
This  situation  was  tolerated  by  the  regime,  provided  that  the 
churches  did  not  interfere  with  its  efforts  to  control  public  life. 
When  the  churches  were  outraged  by  such  Nazi  practices  as 
euthanasia,  they  protested.  The  regime  responded  by  more 
carefully  concealing  such  medical  procedures.  Otherwise,  with 
the  exception  of  a  few  brave  isolated  clergymen,  the  churches 
rarely  spoke  out  against  the  regime.  The  regime's  chief  vic- 
tims— -Jews,  Communists,  Socialists,  labor  leaders,  and  writ- 
ers— generally  had  not  been  close  to  the  churches,  and  their 
persecution  was  witnessed  in  silence. 

Joseph  Goebbels,  the  minister  of  propaganda,  contributed 
to  the  regime's  consolidation  with  the  establishment  of  the 
Reich  Cultural  Chamber,  which  extended  Gleichschaltung  to  the 
educational  system,  the  radio,  and  the  cultural  institutions. 
However,  an  elaborate  system  of  censorship  was  not  considered 
necessary  to  control  the  press.  Non-Nazi  party  newspapers  had 
already  been  suppressed.  The  editors  of  the  remaining  newspa- 
pers soon  were  able  to  figure  out  what  was  deemed  suitable  for 
public  consumption.  Goebbels  also  took  an  interest  in  Ger- 
many's substantial  film  industry,  pressuring  it  to  make  pleasant, 
amusing  films  that  would  distract  the  German  public  in  its  lei- 
sure hours. 

The  regime  soon  achieved  its  desired  consolidation.  Many 
Germans  supported  it,  some  out  of  opportunism,  some 
because  they  liked  certain  aspects  of  it  such  as  full  employ- 
ment, which  was  quickly  achieved.  The  regime  also  brought 
social  order,  something  many  Germans  welcomed  after  fifteen 
years  of  political  and  economic  chaos.  Many  were  won  over  by 
Hitler's  diplomatic  successes,  which  began  soon  after  he  came 
to  power  and  continued  through  the  1930s  and  which  seemed 
to  restore  Germany  to  what  they  saw  as  its  rightful  place  in  the 
international  community. 

Foreign  Policy 

Once  his  regime  was  consolidated,  Hitler  took  little  interest 
in  domestic  policy,  his  sole  concern  being  that  Germany 
become  sufficiently  strong  to  realize  his  long-term  geopolitical 
goal  of  creating  a  German  empire  that  would  dominate  west- 
ern Europe  and  extend  deep  into  Russia.  In  a  first  step  toward 
this  goal,  he  made  a  de  facto  revision  to  the  Treaty  of  Versailles 


62

by  ceasing  to  heed  its  restrictions  on  German  rearmament. 
Soon  after  becoming  chancellor,  Hitler  ordered  that  rearma- 
ment, secretly  under  way  since  the  early  1920s,  be  stepped  up. 
Later  in  1933,  he  withdrew  Germany  from  the  League  of 
Nations  to  reduce  possible  foreign  control  over  Germany.  In 
1935  he  announced  that  Germany  had  begun  rearmament, 
would  greatly  increase  the  size  of  its  army,  and  had  established 
an  air  force.  Italy,  France,  and  Britain  protested  these  actions 
but  did  nothing  further,  and  Hitler  soon  signed  an  agreement 
with  Britain  permitting  Germany  to  maintain  a  navy  one-third 
the  size  of  the  British  fleet.  In  1936  Hitler  remilitarized  the 
Rhineland,  in  violation  of  various  treaties.  There  was  no  for- 
eign opposition. 

In  1936  Germany  began  closer  relations  with  fascist  Italy,  a 
pariah  state  because  of  its  invasion  of  Ethiopia  the  year  before. 
The  two  antidemocratic  states  joined  together  to  assist  General 
Francisco  Franco  in  overthrowing  Spain's  republican  govern- 
ment during  the  Spanish  Civil  War  (1936-39).  In  November 
1936,  Germany  and  Italy  formed  the  Berlin-Rome  Axis.  That 
same  year,  Germany,  Italy,  and  Japan  signed  the  Anti-Comin- 
tern Pact,  the  three  signatories  pledging  to  defend  each  other 
against  the  Soviet  Union  and  international  communism. 

It  was  also  in  1936  that  Hitler  informed  the  regime's  top  offi- 
cials that  Germany  must  be  ready  for  war  by  1940.  In  response, 
the  Four-Year  Plan  was  established.  Developed  under  the  direc- 
tion of  Hermann  Goering,  it  set  forth  production  quotas  and 
market  guidelines.  Efforts  to  regiment  the  economy  were  not 
without  conflict.  Some  of  the  economic  elite  desired  that  Ger- 
many be  integrated  into  the  world's  economy.  Others  advo- 
cated autarchy,  that  is,  firmly  basing  the  German  economy  in 
Central  Europe  and  securing  its  raw  materials  through  barter 
agreements. 

In  the  end,  no  clear  decision  on  the  management  of  the  Ger- 
man economy  was  made.  Large  weapons  contracts  with  indus- 
trial firms  soon  had  the  economy  running  at  top  speed,  and 
full  employment  was  reached  by  1937.  Wages  did  not  increase 
much  for  ordinary  workers,  but  job  security  after  years  of  eco- 
nomic depression  was  much  appreciated.  The  rearmament 
program  was  not  placed  on  a  sound  financial  footing,  however. 
Taxes  were  not  increased  to  pay  for  it  because  the  regime 
feared  that  this  would  dissatisfy  workers.  Instead,  the  regime 
tapped  the  country's  foreign  reserves,  which  were  largely 
exhausted  by  1939.  The  regime  also  shunned  a  rigorous  orga- 


63 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

nization  of  rearmament  because  it  feared  the  social  tensions 
this  might  engender.  The  production  of  consumer  goods  was 
not  curtailed  either,  again  based  on  the  belief  that  the  morale 
of  the  population  had  to  remain  high  if  Germany  were  to 
become  strong.  In  addition,  because  Hitler  expected  that  the 
wars  waged  in  pursuit  of  his  foreign  policy  goals  would  be 
short,  he  judged  great  supplies  of  weapons  to  be  unnecessary. 
Thus,  when  war  began  in  September  1939  with  the  invasion  of 
Poland,  Germany  had  a  broad  and  impressive  range  of  weap- 
ons, but  not  much  in  the  way  of  replacements.  As  in  World  War 
I,  the  regime  expected  that  the  defeated  would  pay  for  Ger- 
many's expansion. 

Through  1937  Hitler's  foreign  policy  had  the  approval  of  tra- 
ditional conservatives.  However,  because  many  of  them  were 
skeptical  about  his  long-range  goals,  Hitler  replaced  a  number 
of  high  military  officers  and  diplomats  with  more  pliable  subor- 
dinates. In  March  1938,  the  German  army  was  permitted  to 
occupy  Austria  by  that  country's  browbeaten  political  leader- 
ship. The  annexation  (Anschluss)  of  Austria  was  welcomed  by 
most  Austrians,  who  wished  to  become  part  of  a  greater  Ger- 
many, something  forbidden  by  the  Treaty  of  Versailles.  In  Sep- 
tember 1938,  British  prime  minister  Neville  Chamberlain 
consented  to  Hitler's  desire  to  take  possession  of  the  Sudeten- 
land,  an  area  in  Czechoslovakia  bordering  Germany  that  was 
inhabited  by  about  3  million  Germans.  In  March  1939,  Ger- 
many occupied  the  Czech-populated  western  provinces  of 
Bohemia  and  Moravia,  and  Slovakia  was  made  a  German  pup- 
pet state. 

Immediately  after  the  German  occupation  of  Bohemia  and 
Moravia,  Britain  and  France  finally  became  convinced  of  Hit- 
ler's expansionist  objectives  and  announced  their  intention  to 
defend  the  sovereignty  of  Poland.  Because  Hitler  had  con- 
cluded that  he  could  not  hope  for  British  neutrality  in  the  com- 
ing war,  he  formed  a  formal  military  alliance  with  Italy — the 
Pact  of  Steel.  In  August  he  signed  a  nonaggression  pact  with 
the  Soviet  Union,  thus  apparently  freeing  Germany  from 
repeating  the  two-front  war  it  had  fought  in  World  War  I. 

The  Outbreak  of  World  War  II 

On  September  1,  1939,  German  troops  invaded  Poland. 
Britain  and  France  declared  war  on  Germany  two  days  later.  By 
the  end  of  the  month,  Hitler's  armies  had  overrun  western 
Poland.  Soviet  armies  occupied  eastern  Poland,  and  the  two 


64 


Historical  Setting:  Early  History  to  1945 


countries  subsequently  formally  divided  Poland  between  them. 
In  April  1940,  German  forces  conquered  Denmark  and  Nor- 
way, and  in  May  they  struck  at  the  Netherlands,  Belgium,  Lux- 
embourg, and  France.  French  and  British  troops  offered 
ineffective  resistance  against  the  lightning-like  strikes,  or  blitz- 
krieg, of  German  tanks  and  airplanes.  A  large  part  of  the 
French  army  surrendered,  and  some  300,000  British  and 
French  soldiers  were  trapped  at  Dunkirk  on  the  coast  of  north- 
ern France.  However,  because  Hitler,  for  a  combination  of 
political  and  military  reasons,  had  halted  the  advance  of  his 
armored  divisions,  the  British  were  able  to  rescue  the  men  at 
Dunkirk.  France,  however,  surrendered  in  June. 

For  Hitler  the  war  in  the  west  was  a  sideshow,  a  prelude  to 
the  building  of  an  empire  in  eastern  Europe  and  the  Soviet 
Union.  Hitler  had  hoped  that  Britain  would  stay  out  of  the  war. 
In  his  vision  of  the  near  future,  he  foresaw  the  two  countries 
sharing  the  world  between  them — Britain  would  keep  its  over- 
seas empire,  and  Germany  would  construct  a  new  one  to  its 
east.  When  approached  with  the  suggestion  of  a  separate 
peace,  British  prime  minister  Winston  Churchill  rejected  the 
offer  and  rallied  his  people  to  fight  on. The  Third  Reich  experi- 
enced its  first  military  defeat  in  the  Battle  of  Britain,  in  which 
the  Royal  Air  Force,  during  the  summer  and  fall  of  1940,  pre- 
vented the  German  air  force  from  gaining  the  air  superiority 
necessary  for  an  invasion  of  Britain.  Consequently,  Hitler  post- 
poned the  invasion. 

Hitler  concluded  by  June  1941  that  Britain's  continuing 
resistance  was  not  a  serious  impediment  to  his  main  geopoliti- 
cal goal  of  creating  an  empire  extending  east  from  Germany 
deep  into  the  Soviet  Union.  On  June  22,  1941,  negating  their 
1939  nonaggression  pact,  Germany  invaded  the  Soviet  Union. 
Eagerness  to  realize  his  long-held  dream  caused  Hitler  to  gam- 
ble everything  on  a  quick  military  campaign.  He  had  antici- 
pated victory  within  three  months,  but  effective  Soviet 
resistance  and  the  early  onset  of  winter  stopped  German 
advances.  A  counteroffensive,  launched  in  early  1942,  drove 
the  Germans  back  from  Moscow.  In  the  summer  of  1942,  Hitler 
shifted  the  attack  to  the  south  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  began  a 
large  offensive  to  secure  the  Caucasian  oil  fields.  By  September 
1942,  the  Axis  controlled  an  area  extending  from  northern 
Norway  to  North  Africa  and  from  France  to  Stalingrad. 

Japan's  attack  on  the  United  States  naval  base  at  Pearl  Har- 
bor on  December  7,  1941,  brought  the  United  States  into  the 


65 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

war.  In  support  of  Germany's  fellow  Axis  power,  Hitler  immedi- 
ately declared  war  on  the  United  States.  But  with  the  United 
States  involvement,  a  coalition  now  existed  that,  with  its  vast 
human  and  material  resources,  was  almost  certain  to  defeat  the 
Third  Reich.  To  ensure  that  the  alliance  not  break  apart  as  had 
happened  in  1918  when  Russia  signed  a  truce  with  Germany, 
the  Allies  swore  to  fight  Germany  until  an  unconditional  sur- 
render was  secured.  Another  reason  the  Allies  wanted  the  com- 
plete military  defeat  of  Germany  was  that  they  wished  to 
preclude  any  possibility  of  German  politicians  claiming  that  "a 
stab  in  the  back"  had  caused  Germany's  undoing,  as  they  had 
done  after  World  War  I. 

The  military  turning  point  of  the  war  in  Europe  came  with 
the  Soviet  victory  at  Stalingrad  in  the  winter  of  1942-43;  some 
300,000  of  Germany's  finest  troops  were  either  killed  or  cap- 
tured. By  May  1943,  Allied  armies  had  driven  the  Axis  forces 
out  of  Africa  and  had  landed  in  Italy.  Also  of  great  importance, 
by  1943  the  United  States  and  British  navies  had  succeeded  in 
substantially  reducing  the  German  submarine  threat  to  ship- 
ping. This  cleared  the  way  for  the  movement  of  arms  and 
troops  to  Britain  in  preparation  for  a  cross-channel  invasion  of 
France. 

Total  Mobilization,  Resistance,  and  the  Holocaust 

Once  it  became  clear  that  the  war  would  not  be  a  short  one, 
Germany's  industry  was  reorganized  for  a  total  mobilization. 
Between  February  1942  and  July  1944,  armaments  production 
increased  threefold  despite  intense  Allied  bombing  raids. 
Much  of  the  labor  for  this  increase  came  from  the  employment 
of  some  7  million  foreigners,  taken  from  their  homelands  and 
forced  to  work  under  terrible  conditions.  Also  contributing  to 
the  Nazi  war  effort  was  the  systematic  requisitioning  of  raw 
materials  and  food  from  occupied  territories.  As  a  result,  Ger- 
mans remained  fairly  well  fed  for  most  of  the  war,  in  contrast  to 
the  hunger  endured  during  World  War  I. 

Despite  their  comparative  physical  well-being  until  late  in 
the  war,  it  gradually  became  clear  to  many  Germans  that  the 
regime's  series  of  military  triumphs  had  come  to  an  end.  Even 
the  most  intense,  mendacious  propaganda  could  not  conceal 
that  Germany's  forces  were  being  beaten  back.  Sharing  this 
growing  awareness  that  defeat  was  likely,  a  group  of  military 
officers  decided  to  assassinate  Hitler.  Although  elements  of  the 
military  had  long  opposed  him,  no  one  had  acted  to  this  point.

During  1943  and  1944,  the  conspirators,  who  included  many 
high-ranking  officers  and  numerous  prominent  civilians, 
worked  out  elaborate  plans  for  seizing  power  after  the  dicta- 
tor's death.  On  June  20,  1944,  the  conspirators  ignited  a  bomb 
that  would  probably  have  killed  Hitler  except  for  a  stroke  of 
bad  luck — the  misplacement  of  the  device  under  a  conference 
room  table.  The  regime  struck  back  and  after  months  of  repris- 
als had  killed  several  thousand  people,  among  them  one  field 
marshal  and  twenty-two  generals.  Several  earlier  attempts  on 
Hitler's  life  had  also  failed.  Because  of  these  failures,  it  would 
be  up  to  the  Allies  to  remove  Hitler  and  his  regime  from  power. 

Anti-Semitism  was  one  of  the  Third  Reich's  most  faithfully 
executed  policies.  Hitler  saw  the  Jews'  existence  as  inimical  to 
the  well-being  of  the  German  race.  In  his  youth  in  Vienna,  he 
had  come  to  believe  in  a  social  Darwinist,  life-or-death  struggle 
of  the  races,  with  that  between  the  German  race  and  the  Jews 


67

being  the  most  savage.  Because  of  his  adherence  to  these  racist 
notions,  he  dreamed  of  creating  a  German  empire  completely 
free  of  Jews,  believing  that  if  the  Jewish  "bacillus"  were  permit- 
ted to  remain  within  the  Teutonic  empire,  the  empire  would 
become  corrupted  and  fail. 

Upon  taking  power,  the  Nazis  began  immediately  to  rid  Ger- 
many of  its  Jewish  citizens.  In  the  Aryan  Paragraph  of  1933,  the 
regime  decreed  that  Jews  could  not  hold  civil  service  positions. 
The  Nuremberg  Laws  of  1935  deprived  Jews  of  the  right  to  citi- 
zenship and  restricted  relationships  between  "Aryans"  (racially 
pure  Germans)  and  Jews.  After  the  Kristallnacht  (Crystal 
Night)  of  November  9,  1938,  an  organized  act  of  violence  per- 
petrated by  Nazis  against  Jews  in  all  parts  of  Germany,  the  per- 
secution of  Jews  entered  a  new  phase.  Random  acts  of  violence, 
by  then  commonplace,  were  replaced  by  the  systematic  isola- 
tion of  the  Jewish  population  in  Germany,  which  had  num- 
bered about  600,000  in  the  early  1930s. 

Until  1941  there  had  been  plans  to  "cleanse"  Germany  of 
Jews  by  gathering  them  together  and  expelling  them  from  the 
Reich.  One  plan  had  as  its  goal  the  transfer  of  Germany's  Jews 
to  Madagascar.  A  contingent  of  Jews  had  even  been  moved  to 
southern  France  in  preparation.  However,  wartime  conditions 
and  the  presence  of  millions  of  Jews  in  Poland,  the  Soviet 
Union,  and  other  occupied  areas  in  Eastern  Europe  gradually 
led  to  the  adoption  of  another  plan:  the  systematic  extermina- 
tion of  all  Jews  who  came  under  German  control.  Techniques 
that  had  been  developed  for  the  regime's  euthanasia  program 
came  to  be  used  against  Jews.  Discussions  in  January  1942  at 
the  Wannsee  Conference  on  the  outskirts  of  Berlin  led  to  the 
improved  organization  and  coordination  of  the  program  of 
genocide. 

Killing  came  to  be  done  in  an  efficient,  factorylike  fashion  in 
large  extermination  camps  run  by  Himmler's  Special  Duty  Sec- 
tion (Sonderdienst — SD).  The  tempo  of  the  mass  murder  of 
Jewish  men,  women,  and  children  was  accelerated  toward  the 
end  of  the  war.  Hitler's  preoccupation  with  the  "final  solution" 
was  so  great  that  the  transport  of  Jews  was  at  times  given  prefer- 
ence over  the  transport  of  war  materiel.  Authorities  generally 
agree  that  about  6  million  European  Jews  died  in  the  Holo- 
caust. A  large  number  (about  4.5  million)  of  those  killed  came 
from  Poland  and  the  Soviet  Union;  about  125,000  German 
Jews  were  murdered.

Defeat 

In  June  1944,  American,  British,  and  Canadian  forces 
invaded  France,  driving  the  Germans  back  and  liberating  Paris 
by  August.  A  German  counteroffensive  in  the  Ardennes  began 
in  late  December  was  beaten  back  after  heavy  fighting  in  what 
became  known  as  the  Battle  of  the  Bulge.  Soviet  troops,  mean- 
while, advanced  from  the  east.  Western  forces  reached  the 
Rhine  River  in  March  1945;  simultaneously,  Soviet  armies  over- 
ran most  of  Czechoslovakia  and  pressed  on  toward  Berlin. 
Although  faced  with  certain  defeat,  Hitler  insisted  that  every 
German  city,  every  village,  and  "every  square  meter"  be 
defended  or  left  behind  as  "scorched  earth."  The  Western 
Allies  and  the  Soviet  forces  made  their  first  contact,  in  Saxony, 
on  April  27.  Three  days  later,  Hitler  committed  suicide  in  a 
Berlin  bunker.  Berlin  fell  to  the  Soviet  forces  on  May  2;  on  May 
7,  the  Third  Reich  surrendered  unconditionally.  It  is  estimated 
that  about  55  million  people  died  in  the  European  theater  dur- 
ing World  War  II.  About  8  million  of  these  dead  were  German.

Chapter  2.  Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


Half-timbered  houses  of  the  seventeenth  century  in  Frankfurt  am  Main 


GERMANY  WAS  UNITED  ON  OCTOBER  3,  1990.  This  event 
came  after  forty-five  years  of  division  that  had  begun  with  the 
partition  of  Germany  into  four  occupation  zones  following  its 
defeat  in  1945  by  the  Four  Powers — the  United  States,  Britain, 
France,  and  the  Soviet  Union.  Once  a  powerful  nation,  Ger- 
many lay  vanquished  at  the  end  of  World  War  II.  The  war's 
human  cost  had  been  staggering.  Millions  of  Germans  had 
died  or  had  suffered  terribly  during  the  conflict,  both  in  com- 
bat and  on  the  home  front.  Intensive  Allied  bombing  raids, 
invasions,  and  subsequent  social  upheaval  had  forced  millions 
of  Germans  from  their  homes.  Not  since  the  ravages  of  the 
Thirty  Years'  War  had  Germans  experienced  such  misery. 
Beyond  the  physical  destruction,  Germans  had  been  con- 
fronted with  the  moral  devastation  of  defeat. 

Germans  refer  to  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  war  as  the 
Stunde  Null  (Zero  Hour),  the  point  in  time  when  Germany 
ceased  to  exist  as  a  state  and  the  rebuilding  of  the  country 
would  begin.  At  first,  Germany  was  administered  by  the  Four 
Powers,  each  with  its  own  occupation  zone.  In  time,  Germans 
themselves  began  to  play  a  role  in  the  governing  of  these  zones. 
Political  parties  were  formed,  and,  within  months  of  the  war's 
end,  the  first  elections  were  held.  Although  most  people  were 
concerned  with  mere  physical  survival,  much  was  accom- 
plished in  rebuilding  cities,  fashioning  a  new  economy,  and 
integrating  the  millions  of  refugees  from  the  eastern  areas  of 
Germany  that  had  been  lost  after  the  war. 

Overshadowing  these  events  within  Germany,  however,  was 
the  gradual  emergence  of  the  Cold  War  during  the  second  half 
of  the  1940s.  By  the  decade's  end,  the  two  superpowers — the 
United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union — had  faced  off  in  an 
increasingly  ideological  confrontation.  The  Iron  Curtain 
between  them  cut  Germany  in  two.  Although  the  Allies'  origi- 
nal plans  envisioned  that  Germany  would  remain  a  single  state, 
Western  and  Eastern  concepts  of  political,  social,  and  eco- 
nomic organization  gradually  led  the  three  Western  zones  to 
join  together,  becoming  separate  from  the  Soviet  zone  and  ulti- 
mately leading  to  the  formation  in  1949  of  two  German  states. 
The  three  Western  occupation  zones  became  the  Federal 
Republic  of  Germany  (FRG,  or  West  Germany),  and  the  Soviet 


73 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

zone  became  the  German  Democratic  Republic  (GDR,  or  East 
Germany) . 

During  the  next  four  decades,  the  two  states  led  separate 
existences.  West  Germany  joined  the  Western  community  of 
nations,  while  East  Germany  became  the  westernmost  part  of 
the  Soviet  empire.  The  two  German  states,  with  a  common  lan- 
guage and  history,  were  separated  by  the  mutual  suspicion  and 
hostility  of  the  superpowers.  In  the  mid-1950s,  both  German 
states  rearmed.  The  FRG's  armed  forces,  the  Bundeswehr, 
became  a  vital  part  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization 
(NATO).  The  GDR's  National  People's  Army  (Nationale  Volks- 
armee — NVA)  became  a  key  component  of  the  Warsaw  Pact. 
The  construction  of  the  Berlin  Wall  in  1961  by  the  GDR  fur- 
ther divided  the  two  states. 

In  West  Germany,  by  the  early  1950s  a  system  of  parliamen- 
tary democracy  with  free  and  contending  political  parties  was 
firmly  established.  The  Christian  Democratic  Union  (Christ- 
lich  Demokratische  Union — CDU),  along  Avith  its  sister  party, 
the  Christian  Social  Union  (Christlich-Soziale  Union — CSU), 
led  the  coalitions  that  governed  West  Germany  at  the  national 
level  for  two  decades  until  late  1969.  In  that  year,  the  Social 
Democratic  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialdemokratische  Partei 
Deutschlands — SPD)  formed  the  first  of  a  series  of  coalition 
governments  with  the  Free  Democratic  Party  (Freie 
Demokratische  Partei — FDP)  that  governed  the  country  until 
1982.  Late  that  year,  the  SPD  was  ousted  from  power  when  the 
CDU/CSU  and  the  FDP  formed  a  new  coalition  government. 
These  parties  ruled  for  the  rest  of  the  1980s.  As  successful,  how- 
ever, as  West  Germany's  adoption  of  democratic  politics  had 
been  after  1945,  the  country's  economic  recovery  was  so  strong 
that  it  was  commonly  referred  to  as  the  "economic  miracle  " 
(Wirtschaftswunder) .  By  the  1960s,  West  Germany  was  among 
the  world's  wealthiest  countries,  and  by  the  1990s,  Germany's 
economy  and  central  bank  played  the  leading  role  in  Europe's 
economy. 

East  Germany  was  not  so  fortunate.  A  socialist  dictatorship 
was  put  in  place  and  carefully  watched  by  its  Soviet  masters.  As 
in  the  Soviet  Union,  political  opposition  was  suppressed,  the 
press  censored,  and  the  economy  owned  and  controlled  by  the 
state.  East  Germany's  economy  performed  modestly  when  com- 
pared with  that  of  West  Germany,  but  of  all  the  socialist  econo- 
mies it  was  the  most  successful.  Unlike  West  Germany,  East 
Germany  was  not  freely  supported  by  its  citizens.  Indeed,  force 


74 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


was  needed  to  keep  East  Germans  from  fleeing  to  the  West. 
Although  some  consolidation  of  the  GDR  was  assured  by  the 
construction  of  the  Berlin  Wall,  the  GDR  remained  an  artificial 
entity  maintained  by  Soviet  military  power.  Once  this  support 
was  withdrawn,  the  GDR  collapsed. 

During  the  four  decades  of  division,  relations  between  the 
two  German  states  were  reserved  and  sometimes  hostile. 
Despite  their  common  language  and  history,  the  citizens  of  the 
two  states  had  limited  direct  contact  with  one  another.  At 
times,  during  the  1960s,  for  example,  contact  was  reduced  to  a 
minimum.  During  the  1970s,  however,  the  two  peoples  began 
to  mix  more  freely  as  their  governments  negotiated  treaties 
that  made  relations  between  the  two  states  more  open.  During 
the  1980s,  although  relations  continued  to  improve  and  con- 
tacts between  the  two  peoples  became  more  frequent,  persons 
attempting  to  flee  from  East  Germany  still  died  along  its  mined 
borders,  GDR  officials  continued  to  harass  and  arrest  dissi- 
dents, and  the  Socialist  Unity  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialistische 
Einheitspartei  Deutschlands — SED)  rigidly  controlled  political 
life. 

A  key  reason  for  the  collapse  of  the  GDR  was  the  poor  per- 
formance of  its  state-owned  and  centrally  directed  economy. 
The  efforts  of  Soviet  president  Mikhail  Gorbachev,  beginning 
in  the  mid-1980s,  to  liberalize  the  Soviet  Union  and  reform  its 
economy  were  met  with  hostility  by  the  GDR's  top  leadership. 
Word  of  these  measures  nevertheless  reached  East  German 
grassroots  opposition  groups.  Encouraged  by  the  waves  of 
reform  in  the  Soviet  Union  and  in  neighboring  socialist  states, 
opposition  in  the  East  German  population  grew  and  became 
more  and  more  vocal,  despite  increased  state  repression.  By 
the  second  half  of  1989,  the  East  German  opposition  consisted 
of  a  number  of  groups  with  a  variety  of  aims  and  was  strong 
enough  to  stage  large  demonstrations. 

The  massive  flow  of  East  Germans  to  the  West  through 
neighboring  socialist  countries  in  the  summer  and  fall  of  1989, 
particularly  through  Hungary,  was  telling  evidence  that  the 
GDR  did  not  have  the  support  of  its  citizens.  Public  opposition 
to  the  regime  became  ever  more  open  and  demanding.  In  late 
1989,  confronted  with  crushing  economic  problems,  unable  to 
control  the  borders  of  neighboring  states,  and  told  by  the 
Soviet  leadership  not  to  expect  outside  help  in  quelling  domes- 
tic protest,  the  GDR  leadership  resigned  in  the  face  of  massive 
and  constantly  growing  public  demonstrations.  After  elections 


75 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  spring  of  1990,  the  critics  of  the  SED  regime  took  over 
the  government.  On  October  3,  1990,  the  GDR  ceased  to  exist, 
and  its  territory  and  people  were  joined  to  the  FRG.  The  divi- 
sion of  Germany  that  had  lasted  decades  was  ended. 

Postwar  Occupation  and  Division 

On  May  8,  1945,  the  unconditional  surrender  of  the  German 
armed  forces  (Wehrmacht)  was  signed  by  Field  Marshal  Wil- 
helm  Keitel  in  Berlin,  ending  World  War  II  for  Germany.  The 
German  people  were  suddenly  confronted  by  a  situation  never 
before  experienced  in  their  history:  the  entire  German  terri- 
tory was  occupied  by  foreign  armies,  cities  and  infrastructure 
were  largely  reduced  to  rubble,  the  country  was  flooded  with 
millions  of  refugees  from  the  east,  and  large  portions  of  the 
population  were  suffering  from  hunger  and  the  loss  of  their 
homes.  The  nation-state  founded  by  Otto  von  Bismarck  in  1871 
lay  in  ruins. 

The  Establishment  of  Occupation  Zones 

The  total  breakdown  of  civil  administration  throughout  the 
country  required  immediate  measures  to  ensure  the  rebuilding 
of  civil  authority.  After  deposing  Admiral  Karl  Donitz,  Hitler's 
successor  as  head  of  state,  and  his  government,  the  Allies 
issued  a  unilateral  declaration  on  June  5,  1945,  that  pro- 
claimed their  supreme  authority  over  German  territory,  short 
of  annexation.  The  Allies  would  govern  Germany  through  four 
occupation  zones,  one  for  each  of  the  Four  Powers — the 
United  States,  Britain,  France,  and  the  Soviet  Union. 

The  establishment  of  zones  of  occupation  had  been  decided 
at  a  series  of  conferences.  At  the  conference  in  Casablanca, 
held  in  January  1943,  British  prime  minister  Winston 
Churchill's  proposal  to  invade  the  Balkans  and  East-Central 
Europe  via  Greece  was  rejected.  This  decision  opened  the  road 
for  Soviet  occupation  of  eastern  Germany.  At  the  Tehran  Con- 
ference in  late  1943,  the  western  border  of  postwar  Poland  and 
the  division  of  Germany  were  among  the  topics  discussed.  As  a 
result  of  the  conference,  a  commission  began  to  work  out 
detailed  plans  for  the  occupation  and  administration  of  Ger- 
many after  the  war.  At  the  Yalta  Conference  in  February  1945, 
participants  decided  that  in  addition  to  United  States,  British, 
and  Soviet  occupation  zones  in  Germany,  the  French  were  also 


76 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


to  have  an  occupation  zone,  carved  out  of  the  United  States 
and  British  zones. 

The  relative  harmony  that  had  prevailed  among  the  United 
States,  Britain,  and  the  Soviet  Union  began  to  show  strains  at 
the  Potsdam  Conference,  held  from  July  17  to  August  2,  1945. 
In  most  instances,  Soviet  leader  Joseph  Stalin  was  successful  in 
getting  the  settlements  he  desired.  One  of  his  most  far-reach- 
ing victories  was  securing  the  conference's  approval  of  his  deci- 
sion to  compensate  Poland  for  the  loss  of  territory  in  the  east 
to  the  Soviet  Union  by  awarding  it  administrative  control  over 
parts  of  Germany.  Pending  the  negotiation  of  a  peace  treaty 
with  Germany,  Poland  was  to  administer  the  German  provinces 
of  Pomerania,  Silesia,  and  the  southern  portion  of  East  Prussia. 
The  forcible  "transfer"  to  the  west  of  Germans  living  in  these 
provinces  was  likewise  approved. 

The  movement  westward  of  Germans  living  east  of  a  line 
formed  by  the  Oder  and  western  Neisse  rivers  resulted  in  the 
death  or  disappearance  of  approximately  2  million  Germans, 
while  an  estimated  12  million  Germans  lost  their  homes.  The 
presence  of  these  millions  of  refugees  in  what  remained  Ger- 
man territory  in  the  west  was  a  severe  hardship  for  the  local 
populations  and  the  occupation  authorities. 

The  conferees  at  Potsdam  also  decided  that  each  occupying 
power  was  to  receive  reparations  in  the  form  of  goods  and 
industrial  equipment  in  compensation  for  its  losses  during  the 
war.  Because  most  German  industry  lay  outside  its  zone,  it  was 
agreed  that  the  Soviet  Union  was  to  take  industrial  plants  from 
the  other  zones  and  in  exchange  supply  them  with  agricultural 
products.  The  Allies,  remembering  the  political  costs  of  finan- 
cial reparations  after  World  War  I,  had  decided  that  repara- 
tions consisting  of  payments  in  kind  were  less  likely  to  imperil 
the  peace  after  World  War  II. 

The  final  document  of  the  Potsdam  Conference,  the  Pots- 
dam Accord,  also  included  provisions  for  demilitarizing  and 
denazifying  Germany  and  for  restructuring  German  political 
life  on  democratic  principles.  German  economic  unity  was  to 
be  preserved. 

The  boundaries  of  the  four  occupation  zones  established  at 
Yalta  generally  followed  the  borders  of  the  former  German  fed- 
eral states  (Lander,  sing.,  Land).  Only  Prussia  constituted  an 
exception:  it  was  dissolved  altogether,  and  its  territory  was 
absorbed  by  the  remaining  German  Lander  in  northern  and 
northwestern  Germany.  Prussia's  former  capital,  Berlin,  dif- 


77 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

fered  from  the  rest  of  Germany  in  that  it  was  occupied  by  all 
four  Allies — and  thus  had  so-called  Four  Power  status.  The 
occupation  zone  of  the  United  States  consisted  of  the  Land  of 
Hesse,  the  northern  half  of  the  present-day  Land  of 
Baden-Wurttemberg,  Bavaria,  and  the  southern  part  of  Greater 
Berlin.  The  British  zone  consisted  of  the  Lander  of 
Schleswig-Holstein,  Lower  Saxony,  North  Rhine-Westphalia, 
and  the  western  sector  of  Greater  Berlin.  The  French  were 
apportioned  the  Lander  of  Rhineland-Palatinate,  the  Saar- 
land— which  later  received  a  special  status — the  southern  half 
of  Baden-Wurttemberg,  and  the  northern  sector  of  Greater 
Berlin.  The  Soviet  Union  controlled  the  Lander  of  Mecklen- 
burg, Brandenburg,  Saxony,  Saxony-Anhalt,  Thuringia,  and 
the  eastern  sector  of  Greater  Berlin,  which  constituted  almost 
half  the  total  area  of  the  city. 

The  zones  were  governed  by  the  Allied  Control  Council 
(ACC),  consisting  of  the  four  supreme  commanders  of  the 
Allied  Forces.  The  ACC's  decisions  were  to  be  unanimous.  If 
agreement  could  not  be  reached,  the  commanders  would 
forego  unified  actions,  and  each  would  confine  his  attention  to 
his  own  zone,  where  he  had  supreme  authority.  Indeed,  the 
ACC  had  no  executive  authority  of  its  own,  but  rather  had  to 
rely  on  the  cooperation  of  each  military  governor  to  imple- 
ment its  decisions  in  his  occupation  zone.  Given  the  immense 
problems  involved  in  establishing  a  provisional  administration, 
unanimity  was  often  lacking,  and  occupation  policies  soon  var- 
ied. 

The  French,  for  instance,  vetoed  the  establishment  of  a  cen- 
tral German  administration,  a  decision  that  furthered  the 
country's  eventual  division.  Because  they  had  not  participated 
in  the  Potsdam  Conference,  the  French  did  not  feel  bound  to 
the  conference's  decision  that  the  country  would  remain  an 
economic  unit.  Instead,  the  French  sought  to  extract  as  much 
as  they  could  from  Germany  and  even  annexed  the  Saar  area 
for  a  time. 

The  Soviet  occupiers  likewise  sought  to  recover  as  much  as 
possible  from  Germany  as  compensation  for  the  losses  their 
country  had  sustained  during  the  war.  Unlike  the  French,  how- 
ever, they  sought  to  influence  Germany  as  a  whole  and  hoped 
to  hold  an  expanded  area  of  influence.  In  their  own  zone,  the 
Soviet  authorities  quickly  moved  toward  establishing  a  socialist 
society  like  their  own. 


78 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


The  United  States  had  the  greatest  interest  in  denazification 
and  in  the  establishment  of  a  liberal  democratic  system.  Early 
plans,  such  as  the  Morgenthau  Plan  to  keep  Germans  poor  by 
basing  their  economy  on  agriculture,  were  dropped  as  the 
Soviet  Union  came  to  be  seen  as  a  threat  and  Germany  as  a 
potential  ally. 

Britain  had  the  least  ambitious  plans  for  its  zone.  However, 
British  authorities  soon  realized  that  unless  Germany  became 
economically  self-sufficient,  British  taxpayers  would  bear  the 
expense  of  feeding  its  population.  To  facilitate  German  eco- 
nomic self-sufficiency,  United  States  and  British  occupation 
policies  soon  merged,  and  by  the  beginning  of  1947  their  zones 
had  been  joined  into  one  economic  area — the  Bizone. 

The  Nuremberg  Trials  and  Denazification 

The  Allies  agreed  that  Germany  should  never  again  have  the 
opportunity  to  destroy  European  peace  as  it  had  in  the  two 
world  wars.  A  principal  aim  of  the  Allies  was  to  prevent  the 
resurgence  of  a  powerful  and  aggressive  Germany.  As  a  first 
step  toward  demilitarizing,  denazifying,  and  democratizing 
Germany,  the  Allies  established  an  international  military  tribu- 
nal in  August  1945  to  jointly  try  individuals  considered  respon- 
sible for  the  outbreak  of  the  war  and  for  crimes  committed  by 
the  Hitler  regime  (see  The  Third  Reich,  1933-45,  ch.  1). 
Nuremberg,  the  city  where  the  most  elaborate  political  rallies 
of  the  Hitler  regime  had  been  staged,  was  chosen  as  the  loca- 
tion for  the  trials,  which  began  in  November  1945. 

On  trial  were  twenty-two  men  seen  as  principally  responsible 
for  the  National  Socialist  regime,  its  administration,  and  the 
direction  of  the  German  armed  forces,  the  Wehrmacht. 
Among  the  defendants  accused  of  conspiracy,  crimes  against 
peace,  crimes  against  humanity,  and  war  crimes  were  Hermann 
Goering,  Wilhelm  Keitel,  Joachim  von  Ribbentrop,  Rudolf 
Hess,  and  Albert  Speer.  Although  many  Germans  considered 
the  accusation  of  conspiracy  to  be  on  questionable  legal 
grounds,  the  accusers  were  successful  in  unveiling  the  back- 
ground of  developments  that  had  led  to  the  outbreak  of  World 
War  II,  as  well  as  the  extent  of  the  atrocities  committed  in  the 
name  of  the  Hitler  regime.  Twelve  of  the  accused  were  sen- 
tenced to  death,  seven  received  prison  sentences,  and  three 
were  acquitted. 

The  trials  received  wide  publicity  in  Germany  and  through- 
out the  world.  Although  many  Germans  maintained  that  it 


79 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 


would  have  been  better  if  the  defendants  had  faced  a  German 
tribunal  rather  than  one  imposed  by  the  war's  foreign  victors, 
they  agreed  that  the  trials  made  public  much  information 
about  the  mass  murders  and  other  crimes  that  otherwise  might 
not  have  come  to  light.  The  German  people  and  the  rest  of  the 
world  reacted  with  horror  and  dismay  to  the  revelations.  The 
trials  of  these  more  prominent  figures  of  the  Hitler  regime 
were  followed  by  the  trials  of  thousands  of  lesser  offenders. 

The  Allies  did  not  seek  merely  to  punish  the  leadership  of 
the  National  Socialist  regime,  but  to  purge  all  elements  of 
national  socialism  from  public  life.  One  phase  of  the  denazifi- 
cation process  dealt  with  lower-level  personnel  connected  with 
the  Nazi  regime.  Their  pasts  were  reviewed  to  determine  if  the 
parts  they  had  played  in  the  regime  were  sufficiently  grievous 
to  warrant  their  exclusion  from  roles  in  a  new  Germany's  poli- 
tics or  government.  Germans  with  experience  in  government 
and  not  involved  in  the  Nazi  regime  were  needed  to  cooperate 
with  occupation  authorities  in  the  administration  of  the  zones. 

The  process  of  denazification  was  carried  out  diversely  in  the 
various  zones.  The  most  elaborate  procedures  were  instituted 
in  the  United  States  zone,  where  investigated  individuals  were 
required  to  complete  highly  detailed  questionnaires  concern- 
ing their  personal  histories  and  to  appear  at  hearings  before 
panels  of  German  adjudicators.  In  the  British  and  French 
zones,  denazification  was  pursued  with  less  vigor  because  the 
authorities  thought  it  more  important  to  reestablish  a  function- 
ing bureaucracy  in  their  sectors. 

Denazification  was  most  rigorous  in  the  Soviet  sector.  Civil 
servants,  teachers,  and  legal  officials  with  significant  Nazi  pasts 
were  thoroughly  purged.  Denazification  was  also  used  as  an 
instrument  for  seizing  the  resources  of  the  so-called  "class 
enemy":  former  Nazis  who  owned  factories  or  estates  were 
denounced  and  their  property  confiscated.  After  participating 
in  the  social  transformation,  some  former  Nazis  were  par- 
doned and  even  gained  high  positions  within  the  new  commu- 
nist ruling  class. 

The  denazification  process  mandated  that  simpler  cases 
involving  lesser  offenders  be  tried  before  more  complicated 
cases  involving  officials  higher  up  in  the  Nazi  regime.  With 
time,  however,  prosecution  became  less  severe,  and  the  United 
States  came  to  be  more  concerned  with  the  Cold  War.  When 
denazification  ended  in  March  1948,  the  more  serious  cases 


80 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


had  not  yet  been  tried.  As  a  result,  numerous  former  Nazi  func- 
tionaries escaped  justice,  much  to  the  regret  of  many  Germans. 

Political  Parties  and  Democratization 

The  reintroduction  of  democratic  political  parties  in  Ger- 
many was  one  of  the  primary  concerns  of  the  Allies  during  the 
final  phase  of  the  war.  The  Soviet  authorities  were  the  first  to 
reestablish  political  parties  in  their  zone.  They  ordered  the  for- 
mation of  political  parties  on  June  10,  1945,  well  before  such  a 
directive  was  issued  in  the  Western  zones.  In  addition  to  seek- 
ing to  control  their  own  zone,  they  hoped  to  influence  the 
emerging  political  constellations  in  the  Western  zones  by  the 
early  mobilization  of  a  strong  leftist  movement. 

On  June  11,  the  Communist  Party  of  Germany  (Kommunis- 
tische  Partei  Deutschlands — KPD)  was  reestablished  in  the 
Soviet  zone  under  a  German  leadership  that,  for  the  most  part, 
had  lived  for  years  in  Moscow.  Wilhelm  Pieck  was  its  chairman. 
Shortly  thereafter,  the  Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany 
(Sozialdemokratische  Partei  Deutschlands — SPD)  was  also 
reconstituted,  under  the  leadership  of  Otto  Grotewohl.  When 
it  became  obvious  that  the  SPD  would  emerge  as  the  most  pop- 
ular leftist  party  in  the  Soviet  zone,  the  Soviet  authorities 
forced  the  merger  of  the  KPD  and  the  SPD  in  April  1946  and 
subsequently,  from  this  merger,  the  formation  of  the  Socialist 
Unity  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialistische  Einheitspartei  Deutsch- 
lands— SED).  The  Communists  clearly  had  the  upper  hand  in 
SED  leadership.  Vigorous  resistance  to  the  merger  of  the  two 
leftist  parties  came  from  Social  Democrats  in  the  Western 
zones,  led  by  Kurt  Schumacher,  a  veteran  Social  Democratic 
politician  and  member  of  the  Reichstag  during  the  Weimar 
Republic  and  a  political  prisoner  during  the  Third  Reich.  As  a 
result  of  this  principled  opposition  to  Communist  control,  the 
rebuilding  of  the  SPD  in  the  Western  zones  took  a  separate 
course. 

The  SED  sought  to  retain  the  image  of  a  political  force  open 
to  the  masses,  and  it  governed  through  the  active  participation 
of  its  members.  It  also  competed  with  other  parties  in  regional 
elections.  After  the  Land  elections  of  October  1946  in  which 
the  SED  failed  to  obtain  an  absolute  majority,  the  party 
resorted  to  different  tactics  in  order  to  secure  its  grip  on  the 
electorate.  SED  leaders  created  an  Anti-Fascist  Bloc  consisting 
of  all  political  parties  that  was  to  guarantee  the  introduction  of 
an  antifascist  and  democratic  order  in  the  Soviet  zone.  From 


81 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  very  beginning,  the  SED  could  veto  any  proposal  from  any 
other  bloc  party  not  in  accordance  with  its  ideals  for  a  socialist 
society.  As  a  result,  the  two  other  political  parties  authorized  in 
the  Soviet  zone  were  purged  of  their  leadership,  and  their 
party  programs  were  realigned  in  support  of  SEE)  goals.  The 
two  other  parties  were  the  Christian  Democratic  Union  (Christ- 
lich  Demokratische  Union — CDU),  which  represented  middle- 
class  interests,  and  the  Liberal  Democratic  Party  of  Germany 
(Liberal-Demokratische  Partei  Deutschlands — LDPD),  which 
represented  the  liberal  political  tradition  that  dated  back  to 
the  late  1840s. 

Two  additional  bloc  parties  were  established  in  1948  in  the 
Soviet  zone  to  represent  groups  still  without  a  specific  political 
party.  The  Democratic  Peasants'  Party  of  Germany 
(Demokratische  Bauernpartei  Deutschlands — DBD)  was 
formed  to  prepare  farmers  for  the  planned  land  reform,  which 
would  involve  extensive  nationalizations.  The  second  party,  the 
National  Democratic  Party  of  Germany  (National- 
Demokratische  Partei  Deutschlands — NDPD),  was  to  work  at 
reintegrating  into  a  socialist  society  approximately  2  million 
people  of  right-wing  views.  The  group  included  veterans  and  a 
relatively  large  number  of  former  members  of  the  National 
Socialist  German  Workers'  Party  (National-Sozialistiche 
Deutsche  Arbeiterpartei — NSDAP),  Adolf  Hitler's  party. 

The  Social  Democratic  Party  that  operated  in  the  Western 
zones  was,  in  contrast  to  the  Eastern  SPD,  markedly  anticom- 
munist  (see  Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany,  ch.  7).  This 
attitude  reflected  a  continuation  of  its  bitter  hostility  to  the 
Communists  during  the  Weimar  Republic.  The  reestablished 
party,  headed  by  Kurt  Schumacher  and,  after  his  death,  by 
Erich  Ollenhauer,  could  look  back  on  a  distinguished  history 
of  creating  better  living  conditions  for  the  working  class  within 
the  context  of  parliamentary  democracy.  Although  anticom- 
munist,  the  SPD's  leadership  still  regarded  the  party  as  Marxist 
and  remained  committed  to  working  for  a  socialist  economy. 
As  such,  the  SPD  envisioned  a  neutral  socialist  Germany 
located  between  the  capitalist  economies  of  the  West  and  the 
Soviet  dictatorship  of  the  East.  The  SPD  was  able  to  build  on  its 
extensive  working-class  membership,  which  predated  Hitler's 
seizure  of  power  in  1933. 

For  the  conservative  forces,  the  political  beginning  after 
1945  appeared  more  difficult  because  of  past  fragmentation  on 
regional  and  denominational  lines.  The  persecution  and  sup- 


82 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


pression  suffered  during  the  Third  Reich  by  conservative  Cath- 
olics and  Protestants  alike  gave  rise  to  a  unified  Christian 
conservative  party,  which  would  represent  all  who  opposed 
communism  and  socialism  and  who  held  traditional  Christian 
middle-class  values.  At  first,  several  regional  political  organiza- 
tions formed  in  Berlin,  Cologne,  and  Frankfurt  am  Main.  On 
December  16,  1945,  it  was  agreed  that  their  collective  designa- 
tion should  be  called  the  Christian  Democratic  Union  (Christ- 
lich  Demokratische  Union — CDU)  (see  Christian  Democratic 
Union/Christian  Social  Union,  ch.  7). 

During  the  initial  phase  of  development,  members  of  the 
Christian  labor  unions  strongly  influenced  the  program  of  the 
conservative  movement.  Although  they  did  not  dispute  the 
concept  of  private  ownership  of  property,  they  advocated  state 
control  for  many  principal  industries.  During  the  1950s,  a 
market-oriented  policy  that  was  combined  with  a  strong  social 
component  came  to  dominate  the  party. 

The  Bavarian  Christian  conservative  organization,  the  Chris- 
tian Social  Union  (Christlich-Soziale  Union — CSU),  founded 
in  October  1946,  remained  a  separate  party  organization  and 
kept  its  name  even  after  the  foundation  of  the  FRG.  It  followed 
a  more  pronounced  conservative  ideological  party  line  than 
the  CDU. 

Even  more  difficult  than  the  political  unification  of  Chris- 
tian conservatives  was  the  consolidation  of  the  liberal  move- 
ment in  postwar  Germany.  Traditionally,  the  liberals  had  been 
divided  into  a  conservative  national  liberal  wing  and  a  more 
leftist-oriented  liberal  movement.  There  was  also  a  reservoir  of 
voters  who  understood  themselves  to  be  truly  liberal  in  that 
they  did  not  commit  themselves  to  any  ideology.  Common  to 
all  of  the  party  groupings,  however,  was  the  rejection  of  a 
planned  economy.  A  number  of  independent  liberal  party 
groups  existed  for  a  time  in  southwestern  Germany  and  in 
Hesse,  Hamburg,  and  Berlin.  In  November  1948,  most  of  them 
united  in  the  Free  Democratic  Party  (Freie  Demokratische 
Partei — FDP),  whose  main  figure,  Theodor  Heuss,  became  the 
first  federal  president  of  the  FRG  (see  table  2,  Appendix;  Free 
Democratic  Party,  ch.  7). 

The  Creation  of  the  Bizone 

By  early  1946,  the  Western  Allies — the  United  States  and 
Britain  in  particular — had  become  convinced  that  Soviet 
expansionism  had  to  be  contained.  The  Soviet  Union's  seizure

of  Polish  territory  and  the  drawing  of  the  Oder-Neisse  border 
(which  gave  formerly  German  territory  to  Poland),  its  antidem- 
ocratic actions  in  other  countries  occupied  by  Soviet  forces, 
and  its  policies  toward  areas  such  as  Greece  and  Turkey  per- 
suaded Western  leaders  that  the  Soviet  Union  was  aiming  for 
communist  domination  of  Europe.  Churchill's  use  of  the 
expression  "Iron  Curtain"  to  describe  the  Soviet  cordoning  off 
of  a  sphere  of  influence  in  Europe  illustrated  a  basic  change  in 
attitude  toward  Soviet  intentions  on  the  part  of  Western  lead- 
ers. As  a  result  of  this  change,  Germany  came  to  be  seen  more 
as  a  potential  ally  than  as  a  defeated  enemy. 

The  change  in  attitude  led  United  States  officials  to  take  a 
more  active  role  in  Germany.  A  notable  early  example  of  this 
policy  change  was  a  speech  given  in  Stuttgart  in  September 
1946  by  the  United  States  secretary  of  state,  James  F.  Byrnes, 
proposing  the  transfer  of  administrative  functions  from  the 
existing  military  governments  to  a  single  civilian  German 
administration.  Byrnes  stated  that  the  United  States  had  not 
defeated  the  Nazi  dictatorship  to  keep  Germans  suppressed 
but  instead  wanted  them  to  become  a  free,  self-governing,  and 
prosperous  people.  The  speech  was  the  first  significant  indica- 
tion that  Germany  was  not  to  remain  an  outcast  but  was, 
according  to  Byrnes,  to  have  "an  honorable  place  among  the 
free  and  peace-loving  nations  of  the  world." 

Neither  the  Soviet  Union  nor  France  desired  a  revitalized 
Germany,  but  after  intensive  negotiations,  a  unified  economic 
zone,  the  Bizone,  consisting  of  the  United  States  and  British 
zones,  was  proclaimed  on  January  1,  1947.  After  a  difficult 
beginning,  the  Bizone  proved  itself  a  success,  and  its  popula- 
tion of  40  million  began  to  benefit  from  an  improving  econ- 
omy. Only  in  the  spring  of  1949,  after  a  period  of  sustained 
economic  growth,  did  the  French  occupation  zone  join  the 
Bizone,  creating  the  Trizone. 

In  mid-1947  the  European  Recovery  Program,  or  Marshall 
Plan  as  it  is  more  widely  known,  was  announced.  The  plan's 
aim  was  to  stimulate  the  economies  on  the  continent  through 
the  infusion  of  large-scale  credits  for  the  promotion  of  trade 
between  Europe  and  the  United  States.  The  United  States  stip- 
ulated only  that  Europe's  economy  was  to  be  united  and  that 
Europeans  were  to  participate  actively  in  the  administration  of 
the  program.  The  Soviet  Union  suspected  that  the  proposal 
was  a  means  to  prevent  it  from  harvesting  the  fruits  of  the  vic- 
tory over  fascism.  Deeming  the  proposal  a  direct  affront  to  its 


84 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


communist  ideology  by  "American  economic  imperialism,"  the 
Soviet  Union  promptly  rejected  participation  in  the  program, 
as  did  the  East  European  states,  obviously  acting  on  Soviet 
orders. 

To  fulfill  the  precondition  of  economic  cooperation  in 
Europe,  sixteen  Western  countries  joined  the  Organisation  for 
European  Economic  Co-operation  (OEEC — see  Glossary)  in 
early  1948.  In  April  1948,  the  United  States  Congress  approved 
the  Foreign  Assistance  Act,  which  arranged  the  provision  of 
aid.  Shortly  thereafter,  industrial  products,  consumer  goods, 
credits,  and  outright  monetary  gifts  started  to  flow  into  the 
impoverished  economies  of  Western  Europe.  Cities,  industries, 
and  infrastructure  destroyed  during  the  war  were  rapidly 
rebuilt,  and  the  economies  of  the  war-torn  countries  began  to 
recover.  In  the  Western  zones,  aid  from  the  Marshall  Plan  laid 
the  foundations  for  the  West  German  "economic  miracle"  of 
the  1950s. 

A  functioning  currency  system  was  also  needed  for  a  growing 
economy.  The  war  economy  of  the  National  Socialist  govern- 
ment had  created  an  oversupply  of  currency  not  matched  by  a 
supply  of  goods.  To  combat  the  resulting  black-market  econ- 
omy, especially  noticeable  in  large  cities,  and  to  aid  economic 
recovery  in  western  Germany,  a  central  bank  was  founded  and 
a  currency  reform  was  proclaimed  on  June  19,  1948.  The 
reform  introduced  the  deutsche  mark.  In  exchange  for  sixty 
reichsmarks,  each  citizen  received  DM40  (for  value  of  the 
deutsche  mark — see  Glossary).  Additionally,  controls  over 
prices  and  basic  supplies  were  lifted  by  authorities,  thus 
abruptly  wiping  out  the  black  market. 

The  swift  action  of  the  Western  powers  took  the  Soviet 
authorities  by  surprise,  and  they  quickly  implemented  a  sepa- 
rate currency  reform  for  their  zone  and  all  of  Berlin.  The  West- 
ern powers,  however,  had  already  ordered  the  distribution  of 
deutsche  marks  in  their  sectors  of  the  city.  This  measure,  which 
for  the  Soviet  Union  represented  the  culmination  of  the  West- 
ern policy  to  undermine  Soviet  efforts  to  build  a  socialist  soci- 
ety in  its  zone,  produced  a  sudden  dramatic  reaction,  the 
Soviet  blockade  of  Berlin. 

On  June  24,  1948,  Soviet  troops  blocked  all  road  and  rail 
connections  to  West  Berlin.  Within  a  few  days,  shipping  on  the 
Spree  and  Havel  rivers  was  halted;  electric  power,  which  had 
been  supplied  to  West  Berlin  by  plants  in  the  Soviet  zone,  was 
cut  off;  and  supplies  of  fresh  food  from  the  surrounding  coun- 


85 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

tryside  were  suddenly  unavailable.  The  Four  Power  status  of 
Berlin,  agreed  upon  by  the  Allied  victors,  had  not  included  any 
provisions  regarding  traffic  by  land  to  and  from  Berlin  through 
the  Soviet  zone.  It  had,  however,  established  three  air  corridors 
from  the  Western  zones  to  the  city. 

The  three  Western  powers  acted  swiftly:  an  airlift  of  unprece- 
dented dimensions  was  organized  to  supply  the  2.5  million 
inhabitants  of  the  Western  sectors  of  Berlin  with  what  they 
needed  to  survive.  The  United  States  military  governor  in  Ger- 
many, General  Lucius  D.  Clay,  successfully  coordinated  the  air- 
lift, which  deployed  230  United  States  and  150  British 
airplanes.  Up  to  10,000  tons  of  supplies  were  flown  in  daily, 
including  coal  and  other  heating  fuels  for  the  winter.  Alto- 
gether, about  275,000  flights  succeeded  in  keeping  West  Berlin- 
ers  alive  for  nearly  a  year. 

The  Soviet  Union  had  not  expected  such  Western  resolve. 
Failing  in  its  attempt  to  starve  the  Western  Allies  out  of  Berlin, 
it  lifted  the  blockade  on  May  12,  1949.  The  Western  Allies,  led 
by  the  United  States,  had  stood  their  ground  without  provok- 
ing armed  conflict.  Although  the  blockade  had  ended,  its 
effects  on  Berlin  were  lasting.  By  June  16,  1948,  realizing  that  it 
would  not  achieve  its  goal  of  a  socialist  Germany,  the  Soviet 
Union  withdrew  from  the  ACC,  prompting  the  Western  Allies 
to  create  a  separate  administration  for  their  sectors.  At  the  end 
of  1948,  two  municipal  administrations  existed,  and  Berlin  had 
become  a  divided  city.  A  more  significant  effect  was  perhaps 
that,  in  Western  eyes,  Berlin  was  no  longer  seen  as  the  capital 
of  Hitler's  Germany  but  rather  as  a  symbol  of  freedom  and  the 
struggle  to  preserve  Western  civic  values. 

The  Birth  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany 

Participants  at  the  Potsdam  Conference  had  agreed  that  the 
foreign  ministers  of  the  four  victorious  powers  should  meet  to 
implement  and  monitor  the  conference's  decisions  about  post- 
war Europe.  During  their  fifth  meeting,  held  in  London  in  late 
1947,  prospects  for  concluding  a  peace  treaty  with  Germany 
were  examined.  Following  lengthy  discussions  on  the  question 
of  reparations,  the  conference  ended  without  any  concrete 
decisions. 

The  tense  atmosphere  during  the  talks  and  the  uncoopera- 
tive attitude  of  the  Soviet  participants  convinced  the  Western 
Allies  of  the  necessity  of  a  common  political  order  for  the  three 
Western  zones.  At  the  request  of  France,  the  Western  Allies 


86 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


were  joined  by  Belgium,  the  Netherlands,  and  Luxembourg  at 
the  subsequent  Six  Power  Conference  in  London,  which  met  in 
two  sessions  in  the  spring  of  1948. 

The  recommendations  of  this  conference  were  contained  in 
the  so-called  Frankfurt  Documents,  which  the  military  gover- 
nors of  the  Western  zones  issued  to  German  political  leaders, 
the  minister  presidents  of  the  Western  Lander  on  July  1,  1948. 
The  documents  called  for  convening  a  national  convention  to 
draft  a  constitution  for  a  German  state  formed  from  the  West- 
ern occupation  zones.  The  documents  also  contained  the 
announcement  of  an  Occupation  Statute,  which  was  to  define 
the  position  of  the  occupation  powers  vis-a-vis  the  new  state. 

The  minister  presidents  initially  objected  to  the  creation  of  a 
separate  political  entity  in  the  west  because  they  feared  such  an 
entity  would  cement  the  division  of  Germany.  Gradually,  how- 
ever, it  became  apparent  that  the  division  of  the  country  was 
already  a  fact.  To  emphasize  the  provisional  nature  of  the  docu- 
ment they  were  to  draft,  the  minister  presidents  rejected  the 
designation  "constitution"  and  agreed  on  the  term  "Basic  Law" 
(Grundgesetz).  Final  approval  of  the  Basic  Law,  whose  articles 
were  to  be  worked  out  by  a  parliamentary  council,  was  to  be 
given  by  a  vote  of  the  Land  diets,  and  not  by  referendum,  as 
suggested  in  the  Frankfurt  Documents.  Once  the  Allies  had 
accepted  these  and  other  modifications,  a  constitutional  con- 
vention was  called  to  draft  the  Basic  Law. 

The  convention  met  in  August  1948  in  Bavaria  at  Herrenchi- 
emsee.  After  completing  its  work,  the  Parliamentary  Council, 
consisting  of  sixty-five  delegates  from  the  respective  Land  diets 
and  chaired  by  leading  CDU  politician  Konrad  Adenauer,  met 
in  Bonn  in  the  fall  of  1948  to  work  out  the  final  details  of  the 
document.  After  months  of  debate,  the  final  text  of  the  Basic 
Law  was  approved  by  a  vote  of  fifty-three  to  twelve  on  May  8, 
1949.  The  new  law  was  ratified  by  all  Land  diets,  with  the  excep- 
tion of  the  Bavarian  parliament,  which  objected  to  the  empha- 
sis on  a  strong  central  authority  for  the  new  state.  After 
approval  by  the  Western  military  governors,  the  Basic  Law  was 
promulgated  on  May  23,  1949.  A  new  state,  the  Federal  Repub- 
lic of  Germany  (FRG,  or  West  Germany),  had  come  into  exist- 
ence (see  fig.  6). 

The  members  of  the  Parliamentary  Council  that  fashioned 
the  articles  of  the  Basic  Law  were  fully  aware  of  the  constitu- 
tional deficiencies  that  had  brought  down  the  Weimar  Repub- 
lic. They  sought,  therefore,  to  approve  a  law  that  would  make  it 


87

Figure  6.  Germany,  1949-90 

impossible  to  circumvent  democratic  procedures,  as  had 
occurred  in  the  past.  The  powers  of  the  lower  house,  the 
Bundestag,  and  the  federal  chancellor  were  enhanced  consid- 
erably at  the  expense  of  the  federal  president,  who  was  reduced 
to  a  figurehead  (see  Government  Institutions,  ch.  7).  Prime 
consideration  was  given  to  the  basic  rights  and  the  dignity  of 
the  individual.  The  significance  of  the  Lander  was  enhanced  by 
their  direct  influence  on  legislation  through  representation  in 


88 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


the  upper  house,  the  Bundesrat.  The  Basic  Law  also  safe- 
guarded parliamentary  government  by  protecting  the  federal 
chancellor  from  being  forced  from  power  through  a  simple 
vote  of  no-confidence.  Instead,  a  constructive  vote  of  no-confi- 
dence was  required,  that  is,  the  vote's  sponsors  were  required 
to  name  a  replacement  able  to  win  the  necessary  parliamentary 
support.  The  Basic  Law  also  supported  the  principle  of  a  free 
market,  as  well  as  a  strong  social  security  system.  In  summary, 
the  new  Basic  Law  showed  striking  similarities  to  the  constitu- 
tion of  the  United  States.  To  underscore  its  provisional  charac- 
ter, Article  146  of  the  Basic  Law  stated  that  the  document  was 
to  be  replaced  as  soon  as  all  German  people  were  free  to  deter- 
mine their  own  future. 

According  to  the  Basic  Law,  the  Federal  Constitutional 
Court  could  ban  a  political  party  that  aimed  at  obstructing  or 
abolishing  the  system  of  democracy.  The  activities  of  a  number 
of  openly  antidemocratic  parties  during  the  Weimar  Republic 
had  inspired  the  authors  of  the  Basic  Law  to  include  this  strong 
provision.  In  1952  the  Socialist  Reich  Party  (Sozialistische 
Reichspartei — SRP),  a  successor  to  the  NSDAP,  became  the 
first  party  to  be  banned.  The  SRP  had  maintained  that  the 
Third  Reich  still  existed  legally,  and  it  had  denied  the  legiti- 
macy of  the  FRG  as  a  state.  A  few  years  later,  the  KPD  was  also 
suspended.  Although  the  KPD  was  at  first  represented  in  all 
Land  parliaments,  it  gradually  lost  support.  After  1951  the  lead- 
ership of  the  KPD  began  to  pursue  an  openly  revolutionary 
course  and  advocated  the  overthrow  of  the  government.  After 
five  years  of  deliberations,  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court 
declared  the  KPD  unconstitutional. 

The  Birth  of  the  German  Democratic  Republic 

As  with  the  birth  of  the  FRG,  the  formation  of  a  separate 
nation-state  in  the  Soviet  zone  also  took  only  a  few  years.  In  late 
1947,  the  SED  convened  the  "German  People's  Congress  for 
Unity  and  a  Just  Peace"  in  Berlin.  To  demonstrate  the  SED's 
claim  of  responsibility  for  the  political  future  of  all  Germans, 
representatives  from  the  Western  zones  were  invited.  The  con- 
gress demanded  the  negotiation  of  a  peace  treaty  for  the  whole 
of  Germany  and  the  establishment  of  a  German  central  gov- 
ernment. An  SED-controlled  organization  was  founded  to  win 
support  for  the  realization  of  these  demands  in  all  occupation 
zones. 


89 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

The  Second  People's  Congress,  held  in  March  1948,  pro- 
posed a  referendum  on  German  unity,  rejected  the  Marshall 
Plan,  and  recognized  the  Oder-Neisse  border,  which  separated 
the  Soviet  zone  from  territory  that  was  administered  by  Poland 
but  that  had  once  been  part  of  Germany  Thereafter,  few  West- 
ern  politicians  had  any  doubts  about  the  goals  of  the 
SED-sponsored  congress.  The  congress  elected  a  People's 
Council  and  created  a  constitutional  committee  to  draft  a  con- 
stitution for  a  "German  Democratic  Republic,"  which  was  to 
apply  to  all  of  postwar  Germany.  The  constitutional  committee 
submitted  the  new  constitution  to  the  People's  Council,  and  it 
was  approved  on  March  19,  1949. 

The  Third  People's  Congress,  its  membership  chosen  by  the 
SED,  met  in  May  1949,  just  after  the  ending  of  the  Berlin  block- 
ade. Apparently  reacting  to  current  events  in  the  Western 
zones,  where  the  Basic  Law  establishing  the  West  German  gov- 
ernment in  Bonn  had  just  been  approved,  the  congress 
approved  the  draft  constitution  of  the  German  Democratic 
Republic  (GDR,  or  East  Germany). 

A  new  People's  Council,  elected  during  the  Third  People's 
Congress,  was  convened  for  the  first  time  on  October  7,  1949, 
and  the  constitution  of  the  GDR  went  into  effect  the  same  day. 
The  Soviet  military  administration  was  dissolved,  and  its  admin- 
istrative functions  were  transferred  to  East  German  authorities. 
The  People's  Council  was  renamed  and  began  its  work  as  the 
Volkskammer  (People's  Chamber),  the  parliament  of  the  GDR. 
A  second  parliamentary  chamber,  the  Landerkammer  (Provin- 
cial Chamber),  consisting  of  thirty-four  deputies,  was  consti- 
tuted by  the  five  Land  diets  on  October  11,  1949.  Wilhelm 
Pieck  became  the  first  president  of  the  GDR  on  the  same  day, 
and  the  newly  formed  cabinet,  under  the  leadership  of  Otto 
Grotewohl,  was  installed  on  October  12,  1949. 

According  to  the  first  constitution  of  the  GDR,  its  citizens 
enjoyed  certain  basic  rights,  even  the  right  to  strike.  In  reality, 
however,  there  was  little  freedom.  According  to  the  constitu- 
tion, both  the  Council  of  State  (Staatsrat)  and  the  Council  of 
Ministers  (Ministerrat)  were  elected  by  and  responsible  to  the 
Volkskammer.  All  parties  and  mass  organizations  represented 
in  this  body  were  united  in  the  National  Front,  under  the  ideo- 
logical leadership  of  the  SED.  The  Volkskammer  was  a  mere 
forum  for  speeches  and  mock  debates.  In  reality,  all  policy  mat- 
ters were  decided  by  the  Politburo  of  the  SED,  on  which  most 


90 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


important  functionaries  of  the  Council  of  State  and  the  Coun- 
cil of  Ministers  had  a  seat. 

The  party  structure  of  the  SED  had  been  reorganized  in  the 
image  of  the  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union  even  before 
the  foundation  of  the  GDR,  and  the  system  of  nomenklatura 
(see  Glossary),  with  its  strict  system  of  ideological  education 
and  selection  of  candidates  for  all  functions  in  party  and  state, 
was  introduced.  Within  a  few  months,  East  Germany  became  a 
model  for  all  other  satellites  of  the  Soviet  Union. 

West  Germany  and  the  Community  of  Nations 

At  the  end  of  World  War  II,  Germany  was  a  defeated  nation 
occupied  by  foreign  powers.  It  had  lost  its  national  sovereignty, 
and  the  world  saw  it  as  a  pariah,  guilty  of  crimes  without  paral- 
lel in  history.  In  addition  to  rebuilding  their  shattered  country 
in  a  physical  sense,  most  leading  German  politicians  saw  their 
main  goals  in  the  coming  decades  as  restoring  their  country's 
reputation,  regaining  its  sovereignty,  and  becoming  once  again 
a  member  in  good  standing  in  the  community  of  nations. 

The  figure  who  dominated  West  Germany's  politics  in  its 
first  two  decades  was  Konrad  Adenauer,  a  politician  totally 
committed  to  restoring  his  country  to  an  honored  place 
among  nations.  He  saw  little  likelihood  that  the  Soviet  occupa- 
tion of  East  Germany  would  soon  end;  hence,  he  sought  to 
build  a  strong  West  Germany  firmly  attached  to  the  Western 
community  of  parliamentary  democracies.  As  president  of  the 
Parliamentary  Council,  Adenauer  had  played  a  leading  role  in 
the  process  of  finalizing  and  passing  the  Basic  Law  in  1949. 

Even  before  he  participated  in  fashioning  the  country's  con- 
stitution, Adenauer  had  had  a  long  and  eventful  political 
career.  Born  in  1876  in  Cologne,  he  studied  law  and  economics 
and  became  active  in  local  politics.  As  a  member  of  the  Catho- 
lic-based Center  Party,  he  became  the  mayor  of  his  home  town 
in  1917.  The  National  Socialists  deposed  him  in  1933,  and, 
after  the  attempt  on  Hitler's  life  on  July  20,  1944,  he  was 
arrested  and  imprisoned  for  four  months.  After  the  war,  the 
United  States  reinstalled  him  as  mayor  of  Cologne.  The  British 
military  authorities,  however,  fired  him  from  this  position 
because  of  alleged  incompetence.  In  March  1946,  Adenauer 
became  chairman  of  the  CDU  in  the  British  occupation  zone 
and,  after  having  shown  extraordinary  leadership  in  the  delib- 
erations on  the  Basic  Law,  became  the  first  chancellor  of  the 
newly  formed  state  (see  table  3,  Appendix).

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

One  of  Adenauer's  main  goals  was  regaining  his  country's 
sovereignty.  Although  the  Basic  Law  gave  full  legislative,  execu- 
tive, and  judicial  powers  to  the  new  FRG  and  its  Lander,  certain 
powers  were  reserved  for  the  occupying  authorities.  The  Occu- 
pation Statute,  drawn  up  in  April  1949  by  the  foreign  ministers 
of  the  Four  Powers,  gave  the  occupation  authorities  the  right  to 
supervise  the  new  state's  foreign  policy,  trade,  and  civil  avia- 
tion, as  well  as  the  right,  under  special  circumstances,  to 
assume  complete  control  over  their  own  occupation  zones. 

By  means  of  another  statute,  the  Ruhr  Statute,  likewise  con- 
cluded in  April  1949,  the  administration  of  the  resources  and 
industrial  potential  of  the  Ruhr  area  was  also  kept  under  for- 
eign control.  In  the  past,  the  area  had  been  a  key  element  in 
the  building  of  Germany's  military  machine.  France,  in  particu- 
lar, sought  safeguards  against  future  threats  to  its  national  secu- 
rity by  arranging  the  creation  of  the  International  Authority  for 
the  Ruhr,  which,  under  the  direction  of  France,  Belgium,  the 
Netherlands,  and  Luxembourg,  controlled  the  distribution  of 
the  area's  resources. 

Although  the  Ruhr  Statute  was  designed  to  prevent  Ger- 
many from  ever  again  becoming  a  threat  to  its  neighbors,  it 
later  served  as  the  first  instrument  of  economic  cooperation 
for  the  region.  In  conformity  with  the  Petersberg  Agreement  of 
November  1949  with  the  Western  Allies,  the  FRG  became  a 
member  of  the  International  Authority  for  the  Ruhr  and  was 
granted  the  right  to  establish  consular  relations  with  foreign 
countries.  Furthermore,  the  dismantling  of  German  industrial 
plants  in  the  Ruhr  area  was  largely  stopped,  and  Germany  was 
allowed  to  again  build  merchant  ships.  The  winning  of  these 
important  concessions  was  Adenauer's  first  major  success  as 
chancellor. 

In  the  spring  of  1950,  French  foreign  minister  Robert  Schu- 
man  recommended  the  creation  of  the  European  Coal  and 
Steel  Community  (ECSC)  to  revive  European  economic  coop- 
eration and  prevent  future  conflict  between  France  and  Ger- 
many. According  to  Schuman's  plan,  countries  willing  to  place 
their  coal  and  steel  industries  under  an  independent  authority 
could  join. 

Once  again,  Adenauer  seized  the  opportunity  to  further 
integrate  West  Germany  into  Western  Europe.  Against  the 
SPD's  strong  opposition,  the  FRG  entered  into  negotiations 
with  France,  Belgium,  the  Netherlands,  Luxembourg,  and  Italy 
on  the  formation  of  the  ECSC.  Negotiations  were  successfully 


92 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


concluded  in  June  1952.  The  ECSC  superseded  the  Interna- 
tional Authority  for  the  Ruhr  and  laid  the  foundations  of  the 
future  European  Community  (EC — see  Glossary;  see  European 
Union,  ch.  8).  Adenauer's  conciliatory  but  resolute  foreign  pol- 
icy also  secured  the  admission  in  1951  of  the  FRG  into  the 
Council  of  Europe,  a  body  established  in  May  1949  to  promote 
European  ideals  and  principles. 

Another  important  step  for  the  FRG  on  its  path  toward  reen- 
try into  the  community  of  nations  was  Adenauer's  unwavering 
position  on  restitution  to  the  victims  of  Nazi  crimes.  Of  particu- 
lar significance  was  the  normalization  of  relations  with  Israel 
and  with  the  Jewish  people  in  general.  Although  the  terrible 
atrocities  that  had  occurred  during  the  war  could  not  be 
undone,  material  restitution  could  at  least  improve  the  lot  of 
the  survivors.  In  1952  a  reparations  agreement  with  Israel  was 
arranged  that  called  for  the  payment  of  DM3  billion  to  the  Jew- 
ish state  over  the  next  twelve  years.  Additional  agreements  with 
Jewish  organizations  provided  for  restitution  to  Jewish  victims 
throughout  the  world.  Through  such  actions,  the  FRG  sought 
to  meet  its  obligations  as  the  legal  successor  to  the  German 
Reich,  a  position  it  had  accepted  since  the  FRG's  founding. 

Rearmament  and  the  European  Defense  Community 

The  outbreak  of  the  Korean  War  in  1950  convinced  Western 
leaders  of  the  growing  threat  of  international  communism. 
The  United  States  began  to  encourage  the  Europeans — the 
FRG  in  particular — to  contribute  to  their  own  defense.  For 
Germany,  five  years  after  having  lost  the  most  devastating  of  all 
wars,  this  meant  forming  an  army,  a  step  unthinkable  for  many 
Germans.  Germany's  rearmament  was  also  anathema  to  some 
of  its  neighbors,  especially  France.  As  the  Korean  War  contin- 
ued, however,  opposition  to  rearmament  lessened  within  the 
FRG,  and  China's  entry  in  the  war  caused  France  to  revise  its 
negative  position  toward  German  rearmament. 

To  contain  a  newly  armed  Germany,  French  officials  pro- 
posed the  creation  of  the  European  Defense  Community 
(EDC)  under  the  aegis  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organiza- 
tion (NATO).  Adenauer  quickly  agreed  to  join  the  EDC 
because  he  saw  membership  as  likely  to  increase  his  country's 
sovereignty.  The  treaties  establishing  the  EDC  were  signed  in 
May  1952  in  Bonn  by  the  Western  Allies  and  the  FRG. 
Although  the  Bundestag  ratified  the  treaties,  the  EDC  was  ulti- 
mately blocked  by  France's  parliament,  the  National  Assembly, 


93 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

because  it  opposed  putting  French  troops  under  foreign  com- 
mand. The  French  veto  meant  that  a  new  formula  was  needed 
to  allay  French  fears  of  a  strong  Germany. 

The  negotiations  surrounding  the  planned  rearmament  of 
the  FRG  and  the  creation  of  the  EDC  provoked  a  Soviet  coun- 
termeasure.  After  a  second  East  German  proposal  for  talks  on  a 
possible  unification  of  the  two  Germanys  failed  because  of  the 
FRG's  demands  for  free  elections  in  the  GDR,  the  Soviet  Union 
put  forth  a  new  proposal  to  the  Western  Allies  in  March  1952. 
The  Soviet  Union  would  agree  to  German  unification  if  the 
Oder-Neisse  border  were  recognized  as  final  and  if  a  unified 
Germany  were  to  remain  neutral.  If  the  proposal  were 
accepted,  Allied  troops  would  leave  Germany  within  one  year, 
and  the  country  would  obtain  its  full  sovereignty. 

Although  the  offer  was  directed  to  the  Western  Allies,  its 
content  was  aimed  directly  at  the  West  German  public  and 
aroused  lively  discussion  about  the  country's  future.  Adenauer 
was  convinced,  however,  that  even  if  the  Soviet  proposal  were 
serious,  an  acceptance  of  the  plan  would  mean  Germany's 
exclusion  from  the  community  of  Western  democracies  and  an 
uncertain  future.  Together  with  the  Western  Allies,  which  did 
not  wish  to  act  without  his  consent,  Adenauer  continued  to 
demand  free  elections  supervised  by  the  United  Nations  (UN) 
in  all  of  Germany  as  a  precondition  for  negotiations.  The 
Soviet  Union  declined  and  abandoned  its  proposal.  Adenauer 
was  harshly  criticized  by  the  opposition  for  not  having  seized 
this  opportunity  for  unification.  As  his  impressive  victory  in  the 
Bundestag  elections  of  1953  clearly  demonstrated,  however, 
Adenauer  had  acted  according  to  the  wishes  of  the  overwhelm- 
ing majority  of  West  Germans  (see  table  4,  Appendix). 

Adenauer's  decision  to  turn  down  the  Soviet  proposal  was 
convincing  evidence  that  the  FRG  intended  to  remain  firmly 
anchored  in  the  Western  defense  community.  After  plans  for 
the  EDC  had  failed  because  of  the  French  veto,  negotiations 
were  successfully  concluded  on  the  Treaties  of  Paris  in  May 
1954,  which  ended  the  Occupation  Statute  and  made  the  FRG 
a  member  of  the  Western  European  Union  (WEU — see  Glos- 
sary) and  of  NATO  (see  The  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organiza- 
tion; Western  European  Union,  ch.  8).  On  May  5,  1955,  the 
FRG  declared  its  sovereignty  as  a  country  and,  as  a  new  mem- 
ber of  NATO,  undertook  to  contribute  to  the  organization's 
defense  effort  by  building  up  its  own  armed  forces,  the 
Bundeswehr  (see  Creation  of  the  Bundeswehr,  ch.  9). 


94 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


The  FRG  contributed  to  NATO's  defense  effort  by  building 
up  the  Bundeswehr,  an  undertaking  that  met  with  considerable 
opposition  within  the  population.  For  many,  the  memories  of 
the  war  were  still  too  vivid.  To  avoid  separating  the  army  from 
the  country's  civilian  and  political  life,  as  was  the  case  during 
the  Weimar  Republic,  laws  were  passed  that  guaranteed  civilian 
control  over  the  armed  forces  and  gave  the  individual  soldier  a 
new  status.  Members  of  the  conscription  army  were  to  be  "citi- 
zens in  uniform"  and  were  encouraged  to  take  an  active  part  in 
democratic  politics.  Although  West  Germans  generally 
remained  less  than  enthusiastic  about  their  new  army,  the 
majority  accepted  the  responsibility  of  sharing  the  burden  of 
defense  with  the  United  States  and  the  other  members  of 
NATO. 

By  1955  the  Soviet  Union  had  abandoned  efforts  to  secure  a 
neutralized  Germany,  having  become  convinced  of  the  FRG's 
firm  position  within  the  Western  Alliance.  Following  the  Four 
Power  Conference  in  Geneva  in  July  1955,  Chancellor  Ade- 
nauer accepted  an  invitation  to  visit  Moscow,  seeking  to  open 
new  lines  of  communication  with  the  East  without  compromis- 
ing the  FRG's  firm  commitment  to  the  West.  In  Moscow  in  Sep- 
tember, he  arranged  for  the  release  of  10,000  German  war 
prisoners.  In  addition,  without  having  recognized  the  division 
of  Germany  or  the  Oder-Neisse  line  as  permanent,  West  Ger- 
man negotiators  also  established  diplomatic  relations  with  the 
Soviet  Union. 

The  Soviet  Union  had  recognized  the  GDR  as  a  state  in 
1954,  and  the  two  countries  maintained  diplomatic  relations 
with  one  another.  The  FRG  had  not,  however,  recognized  the 
GDR.  And  to  dissuade  other  countries  from  recognizing  East 
Germany,  Adenauer's  foreign  policy  adviser,  Walter  Hallstein, 
proposed  that  the  FRG  break  diplomatic  relations  with  any 
country  that  recognized  the  GDR.  The  proposal  was  based  on 
the  FRG's  claim,  as  a  democratic  state,  to  be  the  only  legitimate 
representative  of  the  German  people.  The  Hallstein  Doctrine 
was  adopted  as  a  principle  of  West  German  foreign  policy  in 
September  1955  and  remained  in  effect  until  the  late  1960s. 

Another  important  development  in  the  FRG's  relations  with 
its  neighbors  was  that  the  Saarland  rejoined  the  FRG  in  1957. 
After  World  War  II,  France  had  attempted  to  separate  this 
region  economically  and  politically  from  the  rest  of  Germany. 
In  1947  the  Saarland  received  its  own  constitution  and  was  vir- 
tually autonomous.  During  negotiations  leading  to  the  Treaties 


95 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

of  Paris,  the  FRG  and  France  agreed,  in  the  Saar  Statute,  that 
the  Saarland  should  become  a  territory  under  the  control  of 
the  Council  of  Europe.  However,  in  the  referendum  of  Octo- 
ber 1955,  which  was  supposed  to  confirm  the  Saar  Statute, 
Saarland  voters  rejected  the  statute  by  a  two-thirds  majority,  an 
indication  that  they  wished  their  region  to  become  part  of  the 
FRG.  On  January  1,  1957,  the  Saarland  became  a  West  German 
Land. 

In  addition  to  his  success  in  building  a  close  and  firm  rela- 
tionship with  the  United  States,  another  of  Adenauer's  great 
foreign  policy  achievements  was  reconciliation  with  France, 
with  which  Germany  had  been  locked  in  rivalry  and  conflict  for 
centuries.  In  spite  of  remaining  disagreements  on  the  areas  of 
European  integration  and  NATO,  a  basis  for  the  development 
of  more  normal  relations  between  their  two  countries  was 
forged  upon  a  good  personal  understanding  between  Ade- 
nauer and  French  president  Charles  de  Gaulle,  who  had 
assumed  the  French  presidency  in  1958. 

The  German-French  Friendship  Treaty  (Elysee  Treaty), 
which  went  into  effect  in  January  1963,  called  for  regular  con- 
sultations between  the  two  governments,  semiannual  meetings 
of  the  chiefs  of  state,  and  a  youth  exchange  program.  The 
treaty  was  seen  by  many  as  a  positive  step  in  the  history  of  a  dif- 
ficult relationship  between  the  two  countries.  Of  greater 
importance  to  the  majority  of  West  Germans,  however,  was  the 
country's  relationship  with  the  United  States  and  its  secure 
place  within  the  Western  defense  community. 

Social  Market  Economy 

Germany's  economic  growth  during  the  first  decades  after 
the  war  at  times  overshadowed  its  marked  success  at  joining  the 
international  community.  In  1945  the  country's  economy  was 
shattered.  A  good  part  of  what  survived  was  later  dismantled 
and  carried  off  by  the  victorious  Allies.  Within  Germany  there 
was  much  argument  about  how  to  rebuild  the  economy  and 
what  its  nature  should  be.  Socialist  politicians  argued  for  a  cen- 
tral distribution  system,  extensive  state  controls,  and  the 
nationalization  of  banks  and  industry.  Their  main  opponent 
was  Ludwig  Erhard,  a  liberal  economist  appointed  to  head  the 
office  of  economic  affairs  in  the  Bizone,  who  later  became  min- 
ister for  economics  and  ultimately  FRG  chancellor  (1963-66), 
succeeding  Adenauer. 


96 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


Erhard's  concept  of  a  socially  responsive  market  economy 
based  on  free  trade  and  private  enterprise,  aided  by  the  infu- 
sion of  capital  through  the  Marshall  Plan,  proved  to  be  the 
ideal  basis  for  the  strong  recovery  of  the  West  German  econ- 
omy, culminating  in  the  economic  miracle  ( Wirtschaftswunder) 
of  the  1950s  (see  The  Social  Market  Economy,  ch.  5).  In  some 
areas,  for  instance  in  housing  and  in  agriculture,  prevailing  cir- 
cumstances required  the  introduction  of  price  controls  and 
subsidies.  Controls  to  prevent  the  formation  of  cartels  and  to 
foster  monetary  stability  also  remained  the  state's  responsibil- 
ity. The  state  likewise  furthered  the  accumulation  of  private 
capital  and  protected  ordinary  citizens  by  establishing  a  gener- 
ous system  of  social  services  that  included  statutory  health, 
unemployment,  and  pension  insurance  programs. 

West  Germany's  economy  functioned  very  well  for  several 
decades,  and  the  country  became  one  of  the  world's  wealthiest 
(see  The  Economic  Miracle  and  Beyond,  ch.  5).  Thanks  to  the 
strong  social  welfare  component  and  the  system  of  codetermi- 
nation,  which  gave  workers  in  factories  some  say  about  their 
management,  West  German  industry  enjoyed  a  long  period  of 
labor  peace.  The  export-oriented  economy  received  another 
boost  with  the  creation  of  the  European  Economic  Community 
(EEC — see  Glossary)  by  the  Treaty  of  Rome  in  March  1957. 
West  Germany  was  one  of  the  EEC's  founding  members. 

Ludwig  Erhard  and  the  Grand  Coalition 

Konrad  Adenauer  assumed  the  chancellorship  of  the  newly 
founded  FRG  in  1949,  at  the  age  of  seventy-three.  From  the 
beginning,  his  primary  foreign  policy  goals  had  been  the 
achievement  of  German  reunification  through  a  policy  of 
strength,  the  building  of  strong  relations  with  the  United 
States,  and  reconciliation  with  France. 

Until  the  elections  of  1961,  Adenauer  had  enjoyed  the  sup- 
port of  a  healthy  CDU/CSU  majority  in  the  Bundestag.  Various 
domestic  issues  and  very  likely  also  the  Berlin  crisis,  however, 
reduced  the  CDU/CSU's  strength  in  the  Bundestag  and  forced 
the  formation  of  a  coalition  government  with  the  FDP.  The 
work  of  this  government  was  impeded  by  differences  of  opin- 
ion from  the  outset.  Following  the  resignation  of  FDP  cabinet 
members  in  protest  over  a  controversy  surrounding  the  arrest 
of  Rudolf  Augstein,  editor  of  the  newsmagazine  Der  Spiegel,  for 
allegedly  having  reported  classified  material  concerning  NATO 
exercises,  the  working  climate  of  the  coalition  deteriorated. 


97 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 


Forced  to  accept  the  resignation  of  his  powerful  minister  of 
defense,  Franz  Josef  Strauss,  who  had  had  Augstein  arrested, 
and  facing  an  erosion  of  support  within  the  CDU,  Adenauer 
resigned  on  October  15,  1963. 

Ludwig  Erhard  succeeded  Adenauer  as  chancellor.  Under 
Erhard's  leadership,  the  CDU/CSU-FDP  coalition  remained  in 
power  until  1966.  Erhard's  more  liberal  economic  policy 
toward  the  East  European  states  that  maintained  diplomatic 
relations  with  East  Germany  made  maintaining  the  Hallstein 
Doctrine  difficult.  In  addition,  his  position  of  favoring  close 
coordination  of  German  foreign  policy  with  the  United  States 
was  resisted  by  the  "Gaullists,"  even  those  in  his  own  party,  who 
favored  a  continuation  of  Adenauer's  close  relations  with 
France. 

The  CDU/CSU  did  well  in  the  elections  of  1965,  but  rela- 
tions with  the  FDP  had  deteriorated.  A  recession  and  a  budget 
crisis  caused  the  FDP  to  drop  out  of  the  coalition.  Erhard  ruled 
with  a  minority  government  for  a  short  time,  but  after  the 
opposition's  significant  gains  in  several  Land  elections,  his 
party  formed  a  new  coalition  government  with  the  SPD.  Erhard 
resigned  as  chancellor  in  November  1966,  less  successful  in 
that  position  than  he  had  been  as  the  "father  of  the  economic 
miracle." 

When  the  CDU/CSU  entered  into  a  coalition  with  the  SPD 
in  December  1966,  West  Germany  was  experiencing  unprece- 
dented economic  troubles.  High  unemployment,  a  relatively 
high  budget  deficit,  and  an  unexpected  rise  in  support  for 
right-wing  groups,  such  as  the  National  Democratic  Party  of 
Germany  (Nationaldemokratische  Partei  Deutschlands — 
NPD),  brought  West  Germany's  largest  parties  together  to 
form  what  was  called  the  Grand  Coalition.  Kurt  Georg 
Kiesinger  (CDU),  who  had  served  as  minister  president  of 
Baden-Wurttemberg,  was  appointed  chancellor;  Willy  Brandt 
(SPD),  the  governing  mayor  of  Berlin,  became  vice  chancellor 
and  minister  of  foreign  affairs;  and  Karl  Schiller  (SPD)  was 
appointed  minister  for  economics.  Considered  by  many  as 
"unnatural"  because  the  coalition  partners  came  from  opposite 
ends  of  the  political  spectrum,  the  coalition  was  seen  as  a  tem- 
porary solution  needed  to  gain  the  cooperation  of  the  trade 
unions  and  stabilize  the  economy.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

of  the  East  German  population,  particularly  among  workers 
suffering  under  the  high  production  quotas  set  by  the  SED,  Sta- 
lin's death  gave  rise  to  hopes  for  an  improvement  in  living  con- 
ditions and  for  an  easing  of  political  terror.  In  an  attempt  to 
stave  off  increasing  unrest  among  the  population  as  living  stan- 
dards were  worsening  and  production  quotas  were  being 
raised,  the  East  German  leadership,  headed  by  General  Secre- 
tary Walter  Ulbricht,  announced  new  economic  policies  that 
would  end  price  hikes  and  increase  the  availability  of  consumer 
goods.  Ulbricht  refused,  however,  to  lower  production  goals  for 
industry  and  construction,  which  had  been  increased  by  10 
percent  on  May  28,  1953. 

On  the  new  parade  grounds  at  East  Berlin's  Stalin  Allee,  a 
symbol  of  communist  pride,  enraged  workers  assembled  in  pro- 
test on  June  16.  The  following  day,  demonstrations  were  held 
in  most  industrial  cities  of  the  GDR.  Demands  were  made  for 
comprehensive  economic  reforms  and  political  changes, 
including  Ulbricht's  resignation  and  free  elections.  Over- 
whelmed by  such  widespread  opposition  to  their  policies,  the 
East  German  authorities  were  unable  to  quell  the  protests. 
Soviet  military  units  stationed  in  East  Germany  were  called  in 
and,  with  the  help  of  East  German  police  units,  suppressed  the 
unrest  within  two  days.  Order  was  restored  at  a  cost  of  an  esti- 
mated several  dozen  deaths  and  1,000  arrests.  Ulbricht,  the  fig- 
ure largely  responsible  for  the  causes  of  the  demonstrations, 
had  triumphed,  but  the  uprising  demonstrated  the  frailty  of 
the  East  German  regime  and  signaled  the  East  German  popula- 
tion's "will  to  freedom." 

Born  in  Leipzig  in  1893,  Ulbricht  had  served  on  the  Western 
Front  in  World  War  I  and  had  joined  the  KPD  in  1919.  He 
advanced  quickly  in  the  party  hierarchy,  becoming  Reichstag 
deputy  in  1928.  After  Hitler's  seizure  of  power,  Ulbricht  went 
into  exile.  From  1937  to  1945,  he  worked  for  the  party  in  Mos- 
cow. After  the  war,  he  returned  to  Berlin  to  build  up  the  KPD 
under  the  protection  of  the  Soviet  Union.  By  1950  he  was 
chairman  of  the  SED  and  through  a  variety  of  positions  ruled 
the  East  German  state  with  an  iron  fist  for  the  next  two  decades 
by  successfully  eliminating  every  potential  competitor  within 
the  SED  leadership. 

Consolidation  of  the  New  State 

The  most  important  instrument  employed  by  East  German 
authorities  to  guarantee  their  absolute  rule  was  the  State  Secu-

rity  Service  (Staatssicherheitsdienst,  commonly  referred  to  as 
the  Stasi).  Founded  in  early  1950  as  the  secret  service  branch 
of  the  Ministry  for  State  Security  (Ministerium  fur  Staatssicher- 
heit — MfS),  the  Stasi  came  to  exercise  almost  complete  control 
over  the  population  of  the  GDR.  During  the  first  five  years  of  its 
existence,  Stasi  personnel  were  trained  by  Soviet  instructors.  In 
addition  to  its  surveillance  of  the  East  German  population — 
which  was  carried  out  with  sinister  thoroughness  up  until  the 
final  days  of  the  GDR — the  Stasi  conducted  extensive  espio- 
nage activities  in  the  West,  particularly  in  the  FRG. 

Aside  from  its  approximately  100,000  full-time  employees, 
the  Stasi  could  also  rely  on  the  assistance  of  nearly  2  million 
civilian  spies,  or  so-called  informal  employees  (Informelle  Mitar- 
beiter — IM),  who  reported  regularly  from  domestic  listening 
posts  or  from  abroad.  Experts  agree  that  before  its  dissolution 
in  1990,  the  Stasi  had  developed  the  most  perfect  spying  system 
ever  devised  to  watch  over  its  own  citizens.  It  had  truly  realized 
the  idea  of  the  "glass-citizen,"  whose  every  activity  was  known  to 
and  controlled  by  the  state.  In  Stasi  headquarters  in  East  Ber- 
lin, detailed  information  on  individual  citizens  was  collected  in 
huge  archives,  which  survived,  largely  intact,  the  downfall  of 
the  East  German  state. 

An  equally  important  role  in  building  a  permanent  power 
base  for  the  SED  was  played  by  mass  organizations.  One  of  the 
most  important  was  the  Free  German  Youth  (Freie  Deutsche 
Jugend — FDJ),  founded  in  March  1946,  in  which  young  people 
between  the  ages  of  fourteen  and  twenty-five  were  to  be  indoc- 
trinated as  members  of  a  new  socialist  society.  Together  with  its 
suborganization  for  youngsters  from  six  to  fourteen  years  of 
age,  the  Young  Pioneers — later  called  the  Pioneer  Organiza- 
tion "Ernst  Thalmann,"  in  memory  of  the  chief  of  the  KPD  dur- 
ing the  Weimar  Republic,  who  was  killed  in  a  concentration 
camp — the  FDJ  soon  became  an  effective  instrument  for  influ- 
encing the  coming  generations.  An  important  part  of  its  influ- 
ence was  that  membership  in  the  FDJ  soon  determined  access 
to  institutions  of  higher  learning,  recreation  and  sports  facili- 
ties, and  ultimately  career  opportunities. 

Another  important  mass  organization  was  the  Free  German 
Trade  Union  Federation  (Freier  Deutscher  Gewerkschafts- 
bund — FDGB),  which  attempted  to  motivate  the  workforce  to 
achieve  production  goals  and  also  provided  members  with 
opportunities  for  inexpensive  vacations  at  FDGB-owned  sea-

shore  resorts.  Similarly,  the  interests  of  women  were  served  by 
the  Democratic  Women's  Federation  of  Germany. 

By  the  end  of  1947,  all  facets  of  society  were  organized  in 
associations  and  groupings  under  the  control  of  the  SED.  The 
GDR  authorities  also  sought  to  deprive  potential  enemies 
within  the  state  of  the  traditions  and  institutions  upon  which 
the  state  and  society  had  been  founded.  A  primary  target  for 
complete  transformation  was  the  court  system.  Judges  and 
attorneys  soon  came  to  be  used  as  mere  instruments  to  carry 
out  Marxist-Leninist  goals.  The  legality  of  actions  was  deter- 
mined by  the  political  leadership. 

The  SED  also  declared  the  traditional  administrative  division 
of  East  Germany  into  five  Lander  an  obstacle  to  "efficient"  gov- 
ernance. The  five  Lander,  all  grown  out  of  long  historical  tradi- 
tions, were  abolished  and  fourteen  administrative  districts 
established.  This  measure  gave  the  central  government  in  East 
Berlin  much  greater  control  over  the  activities  in  these  dis- 
tricts, which  were  now  much  smaller,  and,  equally  important, 
allowed  it  to  break  with  another  aspect  of  Germany's  despised 
bourgeois  history. 

Planned  Economy 

In  the  GDR,  as  in  the  other  new  "people's  republics,"  the 
authorities'  goal  of  abolishing  private  property  and  every  trace 
of  capitalism  was  to  be  implemented  in  several  steps.  By  taking 
possession  of  all  resources,  as  well  as  of  the  means  of  produc- 
tion and  distribution,  the  socialist  state  hoped  to  be  able  to 
compete  successfully  with  the  capitalist  West  and  finally  dem- 
onstrate the  superiority  of  the  socialist  system. 

Patterned  on  the  Soviet  model,  the  East  German  economy 
was  transformed  into  a  state-controlled,  centrally  planned  pro- 
duction and  distribution  system  by  1948.  Beginning  in  1945, 
large  tracts  of  real  estate  and  factories  were  taken  over  by  the 
state  under  reform  programs  for  agriculture  and  industry. 
After  the  foundation  of  the  GDR,  these  reforms  were  pursued 
with  vigor.  In  1949  the  new  state  became  a  member  of  the 
Council  for  Mutual  Economic  Assistance  (Comecon),  which 
included  all  other  Soviet  satellite  states  and  had  been  created 
in  order  to  coordinate  economic  planning  in  socialist  states 
worldwide. 

The  concept  of  multiyear  plans  was  introduced  with  the  First 
Five-Year  Plan  of  1951.  It  was  intended  to  make  up  war  losses 
and  also  make  possible  reparations  payments  to  the  Soviet

Union.  For  this  purpose,  heavy  industry  was  built  up  on  a  large 
scale.  Production  goals  could  not  be  reached,  however,  because 
of  a  chronic  shortage  of  raw  materials.  The  manufacture  of 
consumer  products  was  neglected  completely. 

The  Second  Five-Year  Plan,  started  in  1956,  aimed  to  com- 
plete the  nationalization  of  all  industrial  concerns  and  the  col- 
lectivization of  agricultural  enterprises.  By  the  early  1960s, 
Kombinate  (collective  farms)  accounted  for  about  90  percent  of 
all  farm  production.  Private  farmers  who  resisted  collectiviza- 
tion were  arrested. 

When  production  began  to  decline  in  the  early  1960s,  the 
SED  introduced  the  so-called  New  Economic  System  of  decen- 
tralized planning,  which  delegated  some  production  decisions 
previously  the  prerogative  of  the  central  planning  authorities 
to  the  Association  of  Publicly  Owned  Enterprises  (Vereinigung 
Volkseigener  Betriebe — WB).  The  WB  was  to  foster  special- 
ized production  within  individual  branches  of  industry,  includ- 
ing the  previously  neglected  production  of  consumer  goods. 
Production  declined  even  further,  however,  and  it  became 
increasingly  evident  to  many  East  Germans  that  their  "planned 
economy"  had  lost  the  economic  battle  with  the  capitalist  West. 

The  Warsaw  Pact  and  the  National  People's  Army 

The  Warsaw  Pact,  which  included  the  Soviet  Union  and  all 
its  satellite  states  in  Eastern  Europe,  was  created  on  May  14, 
1955,  just  days  after  the  FRG  joined  NATO.  Like  NATO,  its 
Western  counterpart,  the  Warsaw  Pact  guaranteed  mutual  mili- 
tary assistance  to  its  members  in  the  event  of  an  attack  and 
coordination  of  all  member  forces  in  a  unified  command.  The 
existence  of  this  command,  which  was  situated  in  Moscow, 
allowed  the  Soviet  Union  to  station  troops  on  its  allies'  territo- 
ries. Each  member  state  was  also  obligated  to  establish  its  own 
armed  forces.  In  the  GDR,  the  People's  Police  (Volkspolizei,  or 
Vopo)  had  created  paramilitary  units  in  1952.  The  Soviet 
Union  had  unofficially  helped  form  East  German  naval  and  air 
force  units  beginning  in  1950. 

On  March  1,  1956,  the  National  People's  Army  (Nationale 
Volksarmee — NVA)  was  officially  created  by  transferring  the 
existing  paramilitary  units  of  the  People's  Police  to  the  NVA. 
The  new  army  was  officially  under  the  leadership  of  the  SED 
and  under  the  direction  of  the  newly  created  Ministry  for 
National  Defense.  Initially,  the  NVA  was  to  be  staffed  by  volun- 
teers only,  but  in  1962,  when  recruitment  presented  increasing 


103 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

difficulties  for  the  SED  and  its  support  organizations,  conscrip- 
tion was  introduced.  Before  the  construction  of  the  Berlin 
Wall,  conscription  had  been  seen  as  impossible  to  enforce. 

As  early  as  the  1950s,  the  NVA  became  the  most  effective  and 
best-equipped  fighting  force  in  the  Warsaw  Pact  aside  from  the 
Soviet  army.  By  the  early  1980s,  the  NVA  had  an  active  strength 
of  167,000,  of  which  approximately  60,000  were  professional 
soldiers;  there  were  approximately  3  million  reservists.  Most 
weapons  were  of  Soviet  origin. 

The  Berlin  Wall 

Besides  its  increasing  economic  difficulties,  by  the  end  of  the 
1950s  the  GDR  encountered  another  problem  that  began  to 
threaten  its  existence:  large  numbers  of  people  were  leaving 
East  Germany  for  the  West.  Nearly  half  of  those  who  fled  the 
GDR  were  under  twenty-five  years  of  age.  Although  crossing 
the  border  between  the  two  German  states  had  become  dan- 
gerous after  new  security  measures  were  introduced  in  the 
early  1950s  and  severe  penalties  for  the  crime  of  "flight  from 
the  republic"  (Republikflucht)  were  introduced  by  GDR  authori- 
ties in  1957,  a  relatively  safe  escape  route  remained  via  West 
Berlin,  which  could  be  reached  from  East  Berlin  using  the  city's 
public  transportation  network.  Once  in  West  Berlin,  refugees 
were  registered  and  then  transported  to  the  FRG  by  air. 

Alarmed  by  the  continuous  population  drain,  the  East  Ger- 
man Politburo  ordered  the  erection  of  a  wall  along  the  border 
between  West  Berlin  and  East  Berlin.  On  Sunday  morning, 
August  13,  1961,  workers  began  building  a  three-meter-high 
concrete  wall  along  the  border  of  the  Soviet  sector  of  the  city. 
Within  a  few  hours,  public  transportation  lines  were  cut,  and 
West  Berlin  was  sealed  off  from  East  Germany.  Chancellor  Ade- 
nauer and  West  Berlin's  governing  mayor,  Willy  Brandt,  sought 
to  calm  the  outraged  West  Berliners.  The  Western  Allies  did 
not  react  with  force  because  they  were  unwilling  to  endanger 
world  peace.  Up  to  that  date,  nearly  3.5  million  had  left  the 
GDR  for  West  Germany.  After  the  building  of  the  wall,  the 
stream  of  refugees  decreased  to  a  mere  trickle. 

Despite  the  construction  of  the  Berlin  Wall,  many  East  Ger- 
mans still  tried  to  escape.  Several  hundred  of  those  attempting 
to  leave  the  GDR  were  killed;  others  were  captured,  perhaps 
after  being  wounded  by  automatic  guns  or  mines  along  the 
border,  and  sentenced  to  long  prison  terms.  With  the  sealing 


104 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


off  of  East  Berlin,  the  East  German  regime  had  solved  the  refu- 
gee situation. 

The  "Socialist  State  of  the  German  Nation" 

The  building  of  the  Wall  effectively  halted  large-scale  emi- 
gration from  the  GDR.  Although  the  SED  failed  to  gain  the 
active  support  of  the  majority  of  the  population,  young  people, 
especially,  began  to  tolerate  the  regime,  at  least  passively.  In  the 
absence  of  any  alternatives,  they  fulfilled  their  routine  duties  in 
youth  organizations,  schools,  and  workplaces.  By  the 
mid-1960s,  the  regime  could  afford  to  lessen  internal  pressures 
on  its  citizens,  who,  encouraged  by  increased  production  of 
consumer  goods,  had  largely  given  up  their  open  resentment 
against  the  SED  and  had  turned  their  attention  to  improving 
their  standard  of  living. 

Ulbricht's  state  visit  to  Egypt  in  1965  ended  the  GDR's  politi- 
cal isolation.  A  previously  unknown  pride  in  East  German 
achievements  and  a  feeling  of  distinct  GDR  identity  began  to 
develop,  first  among  ruling  party  functionaries  and  then  gradu- 
ally among  segments  of  the  population.  In  1967  the  GDR  lead- 
ership, encouraged  by  these  developments,  attempted  to  gain 
official  recognition  of  its  autonomy  from  the  FRG.  When  the 
FRG  refused  to  grant  recognition,  the  GDR  government  pro- 
claimed a  separate  GDR  citizenship  and  introduced  a  visa 
requirement  for  West  Germans  traveling  to  West  Berlin  and  to 
the  GDR.  With  these  measures,  the  GDR  began  to  practice  a 
policy  of  new  assertiveness  and  ideological  delimitation 
(Abgrenzung)  in  response  to  the  FRG's  policy  of  recognizing 
only  one  German  citizenship. 

Membership  in  the  UN  was  a  primary  foreign  policy  goal  of 
the  GDR  in  the  late  1960s.  A  veto  by  the  Western  powers  in  the 
UN  Security  Council  blocked  the  GDR's  bid,  however.  The 
GDR  did  gain  admission  to  the  International  Olympic  Commit- 
tee, which  permitted  East  German  athletes  to  participate  in  the 
Olympic  games  as  a  separate  team.  For  the  GDR,  however,  the 
ultimate  breakthrough  in  the  area  of  foreign  policy — a  treaty 
with  the  FRG — came  only  after  international  political  tensions 
began  to  ease  under  the  new  spirit  of  detente. 

Following  the  conclusion  of  the  Treaty  of  Moscow  between 
the  FRG  and  the  Soviet  Union  in  January  1970,  a  new  era  of 
communication  began  between  the  two  German  states  that  cul- 
minated in  the  signing  of  the  Basic  Treaty  in  December  1972. 
The  next  year,  both  states  became  members  of  the  UN,  and 


105 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

most  countries  came  to  recognize  the  GDR.  Permanent  diplo- 
matic representations,  in  lieu  of  embassies,  were  established, 
respectively,  by  the  FRG  in  East  Berlin  and  by  the  GDR  in 
Bonn,  demonstrating  the  new  climate  of  mutual  respect  and 
cooperation  between  the  two  German  states. 

In  this  new  setting,  there  was  no  longer  room  for  Walter 
Ulbricht,  who  had  maintained  a  policy  of  confrontation  with 
the  West  for  many  years.  The  Soviet  Union,  which  had  demon- 
strated considerably  more  flexibility  than  the  GDR  leadership 
during  its  negotiations  with  the  FRG,  was  also  irritated  by  the 
failure  of  Ulbricht's  economic  program  and  by  his  attempts  to 
demonstrate  ideological  independence  by  adhering  to  conser- 
vative Marxist  principles.  In  1971  the  Soviet  authorities 
ordered  that  Ulbricht  be  relieved  of  power.  His  replacement 
was  Erich  Honecker,  who,  as  secretary  of  the  Central  Commit- 
tee of  the  SED  for  security  matters,  had  been  directly  responsi- 
ble for  the  building  of  the  Berlin  Wall. 

The  Social  Democratic-Free  Democratic  Coalition, 
1969-82 

In  the  West  German  Bundestag  elections  of  September  1969, 
the  CDU/CSU  remained  the  largest  political  group,  holding 
eighteen  more  seats  than  the  SPD.  With  the  help  of  the  FDP, 
which  had  earlier  supported  the  candidacy  of  the  SPD  minister 
of  justice  Gustav  Heinemann  for  the  federal  presidency,  Willy 
Brandt  was  able  to  form  an  SPD-FDP  coalition  government, 
with  himself  as  federal  chancellor.  The  SPD-FDP  coalition 
lasted  until  late  1982  and  was  noted  for  its  accomplishments  in 
the  area  of  foreign  policy.  The  formation  of  this  new  coalition 
forced  the  CDU/CSU  into  opposition  for  the  first  time  in  the 
history  of  West  Germany. 

Willy  Brandt 

Willy  Brandt  became  the  first  democratically  elected  Social 
Democrat  to  hold  the  chancellorship.  Born  in  Lubeck  in  1913, 
Brandt  first  joined  the  SPD  in  1930  and  later  joined  a  smaller 
leftist  grouping,  the  Socialist  Workers  Party  (Sozialistiche 
Arbeiterpartei — SAP).  After  Hitler  came  to  power,  Brandt  emi- 
grated to  Norway,  where  he  became  a  citizen  and  worked  as  a 
journalist.  After  Germany  occupied  Norway  in  1940,  he  fled  to 
Sweden.  Brandt  returned  to  Germany  after  the  war  as  a  news 
correspondent  and  later  as  a  Norwegian  diplomat  in  Berlin. 


106 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


After  he  had  again  assumed  German  citizenship,  Brandt 
rejoined  the  SPD  in  1947.  He  became  mayor  of  Berlin  in  1957 
and  was  the  SPD  candidate  for  the  chancellorship  in  1961.  In 
the  late  1950s,  Brandt  was  a  principal  architect  of  the  SPD's 
rejection  of  its  Marxist  past  and  adoption  of  the  Bad  Godes- 
burg  Program,  in  which  the  party  accepted  the  free-market 
principle.  The  triumph  of  the  CDU/CSU  in  the  1957  national 
elections  and  widespread  and  increasing  prosperity  made  such 
a  step  necessary  if  the  SPD  were  to  win  the  electorate's  favor.  In 
1964  Brandt  became  the  chairman  of  the  SPD.  From  1966  to 
1969,  he  served  as  minister  for  foreign  affairs  and  vice  chancel- 
lor in  the  Grand  Coalition. 

When  Brandt  became  chancellor  in  1969,  he  proposed  a 
new  policy  toward  the  communist  states  of  Eastern  Europe;  this 
policy  later  became  known  as  Ostpolitik  (policy  toward  the 
East).  In  recognition  of  his  efforts  toward  detente  in  Europe, 
he  received  the  Nobel  Prize  for  Peace  in  1971.  In  the  early 
1970s,  Brandt  also  engineered  a  package  of  treaties  that  nor- 
malized the  FRG's  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union  and  with 
Poland,  the  GDR,  and  other  Soviet-bloc  nations.  He  success- 
fully withstood  a  vote  of  no-confidence  in  the  Bundestag  in 
April  1972  and  won  the  Bundestag  elections  in  November  1972 
with  an  impressive  relative  majority  of  nearly  45  percent. 
Brandt  resigned  in  May  1974,  shocked  by  the  discovery  that 
one  of  his  personal  assistants,  Gunter  Guillaume,  was  a  spy  for 
the  GDR. 

In  domestic  policy,  Brandt  and  his  FDP  coalition  partners 
initiated  legal  reforms,  including  the  passage  of  more  liberal 
laws  regarding  divorce  and  abortion,  the  latter  reform  generat- 
ing intense  public  discussion.  Education  reforms  calling  for 
new  types  of  schools  and  for  overhauling  administration  of  the 
universities  were  only  partially  carried  out.  Brandt  and  his  coa- 
lition partners  were  more  successful  in  realizing  their  foreign 
policy  goals  than  in  achieving  their  domestic  aims. 

Ostpolitik 

West  Germany's  relations  with  the  East  European  states  had 
virtually  stagnated  since  the  establishment  of  the  Hallstein  Doc- 
trine in  the  mid-1950s.  In  1970,  in  an  attempt  to  lessen  tensions 
in  Europe,  Brandt  and  his  FDP  minister  for  foreign  affairs, 
Walter  Scheel,  agreed  to  negotiate  with  the  communist  bloc. 
For  the  first  time  since  1948,  the  top  politicians  of  the  FRG  and 
the  GDR  held  talks,  with  Brandt  and  the  East  German  prime 


107 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

minister,  Willi  Stoph,  meeting  in  Erfurt  in  East  Germany  and 
Kassel  in  West  Germany.  Although  the  talks  produced  no  con- 
crete results  because  Brandt  refused  to  recognize  the  GDR  as  a 
sovereign  state,  communication  lines  were  reopened. 

After  coordinating  policy  goals  with  the  United  States,  the 
FRG  also  entered  negotiations  with  the  Soviet  Union  on  a 
treaty  normalizing  relations,  in  which  both  countries 
renounced  the  use  of  force.  The  FRG  agreed  to  make  no  terri- 
torial claims,  and  it  recognized  de  facto  the  Oder-Neisse  bor- 
der and  the  border  between  the  FRG  and  the  GDR.  FRG 
negotiators,  however,  insisted  that  such  agreements  did  not 
alter  the  West  German  position  on  future  reunification  of  the 
country  and  that  the  responsibilities  of  the  Four  Powers  in  Ger- 
many remained  unchanged  by  the  treaty.  They  also  linked  the 
signing  of  the  treaty  to  a  Soviet  promise  to  open  talks  on  nor- 
malizing the  Berlin  situation.  After  the  Soviet  Union  had 
agreed  to  these  conditions,  the  Treaty  of  Moscow  was  signed  in 
August  1970.  The  agreement  opened  the  road  to  negotiations 
with  other  countries  of  the  Soviet  bloc. 

In  December  1970,  after  ten  months  of  complicated  negotia- 
tions, the  FRG  and  Poland  signed  the  Treaty  of  Warsaw.  The 
treaty  contained  essentially  the  same  points  as  the  Treaty  of 
Moscow  on  the  question  of  Poland's  western  border,  the  renun- 
ciation of  territorial  claims  by  the  FRG,  and  the  ongoing 
responsibilities  of  the  Four  Powers.  In  return,  Poland  agreed  to 
allow  ethnic  Germans  still  in  Poland  to  emigrate  to  the  FRG. 
During  the  subsequent  debates  on  the  ratification  of  the  two 
treaties,  the  CDU/CSU  and  part  of  the  FDP  made  their  con- 
sent contingent  on  the  formulation  of  a  strong  statement  by 
the  Bundestag  underscoring  Germany's  right  to  reunification 
in  self-determination  and  of  the  Allies'  responsibilities  for  Ger- 
many and  Berlin. 

Concurrent  with  the  negotiations  on  the  treaties  of  Moscow 
and  Warsaw,  the  Four  Powers  undertook  to  end  disagreement 
about  the  status  of  Berlin  in  talks  that  ultimately  led  to  the  Four 
Power  Agreement  (also  known  as  the  Quadripartite  Agree- 
ment) of  September  1971.  The  talks,  which  began  in  March 
1970,  got  off  to  a  difficult  stari  because  the  Western  Allies  and 
the  Soviet  Union  were  deeply  divided  over  their  basic  interpre- 
tation of  the  "status  of  Berlin."  After  they  "agreed  to  disagree" 
on  this  point,  progress  was  finally  made,  and  all  sides  con- 
curred that  the  status  quo  of  Berlin  should  not  be  changed  uni- 
laterally.

The  Soviet  Union  made  two  very  important  concessions: 
traffic  to  and  from  West  Berlin  would  be  unimpeded  in  the 
future,  and  the  existing  ties  of  West  Berlin  to  the  FRG  were 
given  de  facto  recognition.  Soviet  officials,  however,  insisted 
that  West  Berlin  was  not  to  be  considered  a  territory  belonging 
to  the  FRG  and  therefore  was  not  to  be  governed  by  it.  Further- 
more, the  Soviet  Union  made  the  conclusion  of  the  agreement 
among  the  Four  Powers  contingent  on  the  signing  of  the 
Treaty  of  Moscow  between  the  FRG  and  the  Soviet  Union, 
which  was  still  under  negotiation.  They  thereby  established  the 
same  linkage  that  the  FRG  had  demanded,  but  in  reverse. 

The  Four  Power  Agreement  charged  the  governments  of 
West  Berlin  and  the  GDR  with  negotiating  an  accord  that 
would  regulate  access  to  and  from  West  Berlin  from  the  FRG 
and  secure  the  right  of  West  Berliners  to  visit  East  Berlin  and 
the  GDR.  The  Transit  Agreement  of  May  1972  arranged  these 
matters  and  also  secured  the  rights  of  GDR  citizens  to  visit  the 
FRG,  but  only  in  cases  of  family  emergency.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Following  the  negotiations  on  traffic  between  the  FRG  and 
the  GDR,  both  sides  recognized  the  feasibility  of  arriving  at  a 
more  comprehensive  treaty  between  the  two  German  states. 
Talks  began  in  August  1972  and  culminated  in  December  1972 
with  the  signing  of  the  Basic  Treaty.  In  the  treaty,  both  states 
committed  themselves  to  developing  normal  relations  on  the 
basis  of  equality,  guaranteeing  their  mutual  territorial  integrity 
as  well  as  the  border  between  them,  and  recognizing  each 
other's  independence  and  sovereignty.  They  also  agreed  to  the 
exchange  of  "permanent  missions"  in  Bonn  and  East  Berlin  to 
further  relations. 

After  the  bitterly  contested  approval  of  the  Basic  Treaty  by 
the  SPD-FDP-controlled  Bundestag  in  May  1973,  a  political 
decision  that  the  CDU/CSU  had  warned  against  for  decades 
became  a  reality:  West  Germany's  de  facto  recognition  of  East 
Germany  as  a  separate  state.  To  many  conservatives,  the  Basic 
Treaty  represented  the  failure  of  the  Hallstein  Doctrine  and  a 
final  blow  to  the  possibility  of  Germany's  reunification.  Bavaria 
filed  a  suit  in  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court  in  Karlsruhe  to 
prevent  the  treaty's  implementation,  but  the  court  held  the 
treaty  to  be  compatible  with  the  provisions  of  the  Basic  Law.  As 
a  result  of  the  treaty,  the  FRG  and  the  GDR  became  members 
of  the  UN  in  June  1973. 

Among  the  states  to  the  east,  Czechoslovakia  remained  the 
only  neighbor  with  which  West  Germany  had  not  yet  normal- 
ized diplomatic  relations.  Negotiations  with  this  country 
proved  to  be  considerably  more  difficult  than  those  with  the 
Soviet  Union  or  Poland.  The  main  obstacle  was  a  difference  in 
interpreting  the  Munich  Agreement  of  September  1938.  On 
the  one  hand,  the  FRG  maintained  that  the  accord  itself  had  to 
be  considered  legally  valid  but  that  the  occupation  of  Czecho- 
slovakia in  March  1939  had  voided  its  provisions.  Czechoslova- 
kia, on  the  other  hand,  insisted  that  the  accord  be  considered 
void  from  the  very  beginning.  Both  sides  finally  agreed  that  the 
accord  was  to  be  considered  void,  but  that  all  legal  proceedings 
in  the  occupied  territory  between  1938  and  1945  were  to  be 
upheld.  Once  this  basic  understanding  had  been  reached,  the 
treaty  with  Czechoslovakia,  known  as  the  Treaty  of  Prague,  sim- 
ilar in  content  to  the  Treaty  of  Warsaw,  was  signed  in  December 
1973,  and  diplomatic  relations  were  established.  Shortly  there- 
after, West  Germany  exchanged  ambassadors  with  Hungary 
and  Bulgaria.

Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


Helmut  Schmidt 

Following  Brandt's  resignation  in  May  1974,  the  SPD-FDP 
coalition  partners  unanimously  agreed  that  Minister  of  Finance 
Helmut  Schmidt  should  head  the  new  government.  At  fifty-five, 
Schmidt  became  the  youngest  chancellor  of  the  FRG.  Born  in 
Hamburg  in  1918,  he  served  as  an  officer  in  World  War  II. 
After  the  war,  he  joined  the  SPD  and  served  in  Hamburg's 
municipal  government,  where  he  acquired  a  national  reputa- 
tion as  a  top-notch  manager  because  of  his  competence  in  deal- 
ing with  a  severe  flood  in  1962.  He  was  the  SPD  faction  leader 
in  the  Bundestag  and  minister  of  defense  in  the  first  SPD-FDP 
cabinet.  Schmidt  gradually  became  recognized  at  home  and 
abroad  as  a  pragmatic  politician  and  an  expert  in  economic 
and  defense  matters.  His  first  cabinet  included  the  FDP's 
Hans-Dietrich  Genscher  as  minister  of  foreign  affairs. 
Genscher  replaced  Walter  Scheel,  who  had  been  elected  fed- 
eral president  in  1974. 

Schmidt  was  confronted  with  a  number  of  serious  problems. 
The  economic  turbulence  caused  by  the  oil  crisis  of  1973  had 
affected  the  FRG,  and  a  ban  on  the  use  of  automobiles  on  Sun- 
days had  been  introduced  to  preserve  scarce  fuel  reserves.  Per- 
haps as  a  result  of  the  crisis,  Germans  began  to  recognize 
limitations  to  economic  growth  and  simultaneously  to  become 
aware  of  ecological  dangers  to  the  environment  inherent  in 
their  lifestyle.  As  a  result,  environmental  movements  sprang  up 
throughout  the  FRG. 

Worries  about  the  environment  and  about  long-term  eco- 
nomic growth  became  widespread  in  the  next  few  years,  and 
the  almost  limitless  optimism  of  the  postwar  period  began  to 
give  way  to  a  mood  of  uncertainty  about  the  future.  Unemploy- 
ment was  also  on  the  rise,  and  labor  unions,  traditionally  reli- 
able allies  of  the  SPD,  began  to  depart  from  their  position  of 
solidarity  with  the  SPD-FDP  government.  In  this  increasingly 
difficult  economic  and  political  environment,  Schmidt  tried  to 
steer  a  steady  course,  one  often  too  conservative  for  his  party 
and  from  which  necessary  support  was  at  times  lacking. 

The  Student  Movement  and  Terrorism 

In  addition  to  troubling  economic  and  environmental  prob- 
lems for  which  no  easy  solutions  were  available,  West  Germany 
and  its  politicians  had  to  contend  with  two  new  sources  of 
social  unrest:  the  student  movement  of  the  late  1960s  and  early 


111 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

1970s,  and  left-wing  terrorism,  which  originated  in  the  late 
1960s,  but  which  had  its  greatest  impact  in  the  1970s. 

Inspired  by  the  student  movement  in  the  United  States  and 
by  the  international  movement  opposing  the  war  in  Vietnam, 
as  well  as  by  rising  opposition  to  the  traditional  administration 
of  German  universities,  students  organized  protest  movements 
at  a  number  of  German  universities  in  the  late  1960s.  Sit-ins, 
disruption  of  lectures,  and  attacks  against  buildings  housing 
major  publishing  companies,  such  as  the  Axel  Springer  Group, 
were  staged  by  a  minority  of  student  groups,  primarily  those 
with  Marxist  ties.  Protesters  claimed  that  an  "extra-parliamen- 
tary opposition"  was  needed  to  ensure  representation  of  the 
people  in  a  state  that  was  governed  largely  by  two  major  parties. 
The  student  protest  movement  had  little  support  among  the 
population,  however,  and  was  finally  absorbed  by  the  estab- 
lished parties. 

Terrorism  was  also  a  concern  during  this  period  (see  Dissi- 
dence  and  Terrorist  Activity,  ch.  9).  A  few  radical  student  ele- 
ments sought  to  realize  their  aims  through  political  terrorism. 
Small  groups  launched  violent  attacks  against  "symbols  of  capi- 
talism." They  fire-bombed  department  stores  in  several  cities, 
broke  into  police  stations,  robbed  banks,  and  attacked  United 
States  military  installations. 

One  terrorist  group,  notorious  for  its  brutality,  became 
known  as  the  Baader-Meinhof  Gang,  named  after  its  leaders, 
Andreas  Baader  and  Ulrike  Meinhof.  Calling  themselves  the 
Red  Army  Faction  (Rote  Armee  Fraktion — RAF),  their  aim  was 
to  assassinate  the  "levers  of  the  imperialist  power  structure," 
thereby  provoking  the  state  to  abandon  lawful  methods  of 
fighting  terrorism.  The  arrest  and  imprisonment  in  1972  of  the 
main  RAF  leaders  led  to  an  intensification  of  terrorist  acts  by 
the  group,  which  culminated  in  1977  in  the  kidnapping  of 
Hanns-Martin  Schleyer,  the  president  of  the  Federation  of  Ger- 
man Employers'  Associations  (Bundesvereinigung  der 
Deutschen  Arbeitgeberverbande — BDA)  and  in  the  hijacking 
six  weeks  later  of  a  Lufthansa  passenger  airplane  to  Mogadishu, 
Somalia. 

The  aim  of  both  these  terrorist  actions  was  the  release  of 
Baader  and  the  other  RAF  prisoners.  In  a  spectacular  rescue 
action,  the  Lufthansa  airplane  was  stormed  by  a  special  unit  of 
the  West  German  Federal  Border  Force,  ending  a  five-day  odys- 
sey  through  the  Middle  East.  Failing  in  their  coup,  Baader  and 
three  other  RAF  leaders  committed  suicide  in  their  prison 


112 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


cells,  and  Schleyer  was  subsequently  murdered  by  his  kidnap- 
pers. The  police  had  been  successful  in  discovering  hideouts, 
strategy  papers,  and  caches  of  weapons,  however,  which  led  to 
the  severe  weakening  of  the  organization  of  the  RAF. 

Nevertheless,  supported  by  various  international  terrorist 
groups,  including  the  GDR's  Stasi,  the  RAF  maintained  a  small 
network  committed  to  assassinating  prominent  public  figures. 
In  1989  they  were  responsible  for  the  murder  of  Alfred  Herr- 
hausen,  a  top  executive  of  the  Deutsche  Bank  in  Frankfurt,  and 
in  1991  for  the  murder  of  Detlev  Karsten  Rohwedder,  president 
of  the  Treuhandanstalt,  the  agency  that  managed  the  privatiza- 
tion of  property  in  the  former  GDR  (see  Unification  and  Its 
Aftermath,  ch.  5). 

The  Greens 

In  the  aftermath  of  the  oil  crisis  of  1973,  regional  political 
groups  concerned  with  environmental  issues  began  to  put  up 
candidates  in  communal  and  regional  elections.  In  1980  a 
number  of  ecological  groups,  alternative  action  movements, 
and  various  women's  rights  organizations  banded  together  on 
the  national  level  to  form  the  political  party  that  came  to  be 
called  the  Greens  (Die  Grunen). 

Although  the  political  views  of  the  various  groups  in  the  new 
party  were  widely  diverse,  all  agreed  that  the  continuous  expan- 
sion of  the  economy  was  detrimental  to  the  environment  and 
that  disarmament  was  imperative  if  mankind  were  to  survive. 
The  Greens'  support  for  radical  peace  movements  and  their 
demand  that  the  FRG  withdraw  from  NATO  prevented  many 
West  Germans  from  taking  the  Greens  seriously  as  a  political 
force.  In  the  Bundestag  elections  of  1980,  they  could  muster 
only  1.5  percent  of  the  vote,  not  enough  to  win  any  parliamen- 
tary seats.  In  the  1983  elections,  however,  they  broke  the  5  per- 
cent barrier  and  won  twenty-seven  seats  in  the  Bundestag. 

Differing  ideological  orientations  within  the  Greens  soon 
began  to  undermine  the  party's  effectiveness  in  the  political 
process.  Two  different  factions  emerged:  the  dogmatic  funda- 
mentalists (Fundis),  who  were  unwilling  to  make  any  compro- 
mises on  policy  in  order  to  win  political  allies;  and  the  realists 
(Realos),  who  were  ready  to  enter  into  a  coalition  with  the  SPD 
on  the  communal  and  Land  level  in  order  to  put  environmen- 
talist ideas  into  practice. 

Another  cause  of  disagreement  within  the  party  organiza- 
tion of  the  Greens  was  the  principle  of  rotation  of  seats  in  the 


113 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Bundestag  and  in  Land  diets.  This  policy  required  deputies  to 
give  up  their  seats  after  only  half  a  term  so  that  other  Green 
candidates  would  have  an  opportunity  to  participate  in  the 
political  process.  As  a  result,  experienced  representatives  who 
understood  the  workings  of  parliament  were  forced  to  relin- 
quish their  seats  and  were  relegated  to  subordinate  work  in  the 
party.  Such  unrealistic  policies  persuaded  numerous  talented 
Green  politicians  to  withdraw  from  active  politics,  or  to  leave 
the  party  altogether.  In  1984  a  party  leadership  consisting  only 
of  women  was  elected,  giving  the  Greens  an  image  of  practicing 
reverse  discrimination. 

Although  the  Realos  among  the  Greens  subsequently  partici- 
pated in  Land  governments  as  cabinet  members,  the  party 
remained  on  the  periphery  of  politics  during  the  remainder  of 
the  1980s  (see  The  Greens,  ch.  7).  Nevertheless,  the  Greens 
positively  influenced  the  views  of  the  traditional  political  par- 
ties concerning  the  ecology  and  the  preservation  of  natural 
resources. 

The  Christian  Democratic/Christian  Socialist-Free 
Democratic  Coalition,  1983- 

The  SPD-FDP  coalition  formed  in  1969  became  increasingly 
strained  in  the  early  1980s,  leading  to  concerns  among  the  FDP 
leadership  about  its  stability.  The  SPD  had  become  deeply 
divided  because  many  of  its  members  found  Chancellor 
Schmidt's  policies  too  conservative.  Particularly  troublesome 
was  his  position  on  NATO's  Dual-Track  Decision,  which 
required  the  stationing  of  new  missiles  in  West  Germany  if 
Soviet  missiles  were  not  withdrawn.  FDP  chairman  Genscher 
feared  that  Schmidt  would  lose  the  backing  of  the  SPD  as  its 
left  wing  became  more  influential.  As  a  result  of  these  fears, 
Genscher  began  to  urge  a  change  in  the  political  constellation 
governing  West  Germany  and  the  formation  of  a  coalition  with 
the  CDU/CSU. 

The  SPD-FDP  coalition  broke  apart  in  September  1982  when 
the  FDP  minister  of  economics,  Otto  Lambsdorff,  advocated 
cutting  social  welfare  expenditures.  Schmidt  countered  by 
threatening  to  fire  Lambsdorff.  The  threat  prompted  the  resig- 
nation of  all  FDP  cabinet  members.  Schmidt  presided  over  a 
minority  government  for  a  few  days  until  the  FDP,  together 
with  the  CDU/CSU,  raised  a  constructive  vote  of  no-confi- 
dence against  the  government.  Schmidt  lost  the  vote,  and  Hel- 


114 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


mut  Kohl,  head  of  the  CDU,  formed  a  new  coalition 
government  composed  of  the  CDU,  its  sister  party  the  CSU, 
and  the  FDR  Kohl  himself  became  chancellor  on  October  1, 
1982. 

Born  in  1930  in  Ludwigshafen  in  the  heavily  Roman  Catho- 
lic and  conservative  Rhineland-Palatinate,  Kohl  was  a  founding 
member  and  leader  of  the  CDU  youth  organization  in  his 
hometown.  He  served  as  minister  president  of  the 
Rhineland-Palatinate  from  1969  to  1976,  and  in  the  1976 
national  elections  he  ran  unsuccessfully  against  SPD  candidate 
Chancellor  Schmidt  for  the  office  of  chancellor. 

In  the  1980  national  elections,  Franz  Josef  Strauss  was  the 
CDU/CSU  candidate  for  chancellor.  Strauss,  Bavaria's  minister 
president  and  head  of  the  CSU,  was  one  of  Germany's  most 
influential  and  colorful  politicians.  He  believed  the  CDU/CSU 
could  come  to  power  in  Bonn  without  the  help  of  the  FDP. 
After  Strauss  lost  the  elections  and  Schmidt  remained  chancel- 
lor, however,  Kohl  began  to  steer  toward  an  eventual  coalition 
with  the  FDP  because  he  did  not  think  that  conservatives  could 
win  an  absolute  majority  at  the  national  level. 

New  elections  for  the  Bundestag  were  held  in  1983,  several 
months  after  Kohl  had  assumed  the  chancellorship.  The  results 
gave  Kohl's  government  a  clear  majority  and  confirmed  him  as 
chancellor.  Throughout  his  career,  Kohl  demonstrated  a  strong 
determination,  extraordinary  political  skills,  and  a  keen  sense 
for  the  political  will  of  the  German  people.  His  key  role  in  the 
German  reunification  process  has  deservedly  earned  him  a 
position  of  distinction  in  German  history. 

In  the  first  half  of  the  1980s,  West  German  politics  were 
dominated  by  the  heated  discussion  of  NATO's  Dual-Track 
Decision.  The  peace  movement  mounted  numerous  demon- 
strations to  protest  the  possible  stationing  of  United  States  mis- 
siles in  West  Germany  should  the  Soviet  Union  not  remove  its 
newly  stationed  SS-20  missiles  from  Eastern  Europe. 

In  the  mid-1970s,  the  Soviet  Union  had  decided  to  modern- 
ize its  intermediate-range  missile  arsenal  by  the  introduction 
and  stationing  of  the  advanced  ground-based  SS-20  systems. 
With  a  range  of  approximately  5,000  kilometers,  the  SS-20  was 
capable  of  delivering  a  150-kiloton  nuclear  warhead  within  a 
target  radius  of  400  meters — a  capability  that  could  not  be 
matched  by  any  NATO  weapon.  It  was  clear  that  the  missile's 
target  area  was  Central  Europe.  Chancellor  Schmidt  had  been 
among  the  first  to  warn  of  the  danger  posed  by  this  new  Soviet 


115 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

weapon  system.  The  United  States  reacted  quickly  by  develop- 
ing two  new  weapon  systems — the  Pershing  II  inter- 
mediate-range rocket  and  the  cruise  missile.  Although  the  Per- 
shing II  possessed  a  considerably  shorter  range  and  a  much 
smaller  warhead  than  the  SS-20,  it  was  capable  of  hitting  its 
potential  target  with  almost  absolute  accuracy. 

At  the  NATO  conference  of  foreign  and  defense  ministers 
held  in  December  1979,  officials  decided  to  deploy  108  Persh- 
ing II  rockets  and  464  cruise  missiles  in  Europe  by  the  end  of 
1983.  They  also  agreed  to  enter  negotiations  as  soon  as  possible 
with  the  Soviet  Union  on  the  stationing  of  medium-range  mis- 
siles in  Europe.  If  Soviet  missiles  were  withdrawn  from  Central 
Europe,  United  States  missiles  would  not  be  positioned  in  West 
Germany.  The  United  States-Soviet  Union  talks  began  in 
Geneva  in  November  1981  and  continued  for  two  years,  but 
without  achieving  results. 

NATO's  Dual-Track  Decision  met  with  mounting  opposition 
from  the  West  German  and  European  peace  movement,  and 
numerous  rallies  were  held  in  the  early  1980s.  In  the  fall  of 
1983,  protest  demonstrations  throughout  the  FRG  were  aimed 
at  influencing  the  imminent  decision  of  the  Bundestag  on 
deployment.  Demonstrators  feared  that  if  missiles  were  sta- 
tioned on  German  soil,  the  German  population  would  be 
wiped  out  in  the  event  of  a  possible  nuclear  exchange,  while 
the  Soviet  Union  would  remain  unaffected.  With  time,  how- 
ever, the  peace  movement  became  increasingly  divided,  and 
after  1983  it  began  to  have  less  influence  on  public  opinion. 
Most  West  Germans  saw  the  Soviet  Union  as  responsible  for  the 
escalation  of  the  arms  race  by  their  deployment  of  the  SS-20 
and,  in  addition,  mistrusted  the  Soviet  Union's  apparently 
keen  interest  in  the  peace  movement  in  Western  Europe. 

Chancellor  Kohl  and  his  new  government  were  determined 
to  stand  by  West  Germany's  commitment  to  its  NATO  partners. 
After  a  lengthy  debate  in  the  Bundestag,  the  CDU/CSU-FDP 
majority  coalition  voted  for  deployment,  with  the  SPD  and  the 
Greens  opposing.  Stationing  of  the  missiles  began  immediately, 
and  the  Soviet  Union  withdrew  from  the  Geneva  negotiations. 
By  the  mid-1980s,  as  international  tensions  began  to  ease,  pub- 
lic attention  turned  to  new  prospects  for  detente  between  West 
and  East. 

The  Honecker  Era,  1971-89 

Ulbricht's  successor  in  East  Germany  was  Erich  Honecker. 


116 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


Born  in  1913  in  the  Saarland,  Honecker  joined  the  Communist 
Party  of  Germany  (Kommunistische  Partei  Deutschlands — 
KPD)  in  1929.  As  a  full-time  functionary  of  the  party,  he  contin- 
ued his  work  in  the  underground  movement  after  Hitler  came 
to  power  in  1933  and  until  arrested  by  the  Nazis  in  1935. 
Imprisoned  until  the  end  of  World  War  II,  Honecker  resumed 
his  career  in  1945  as  a  leading  KPD  functionary,  becoming 
Ulbricht's  assistant  on  the  latter's  return  to  Germany  from  the 
Soviet  Union  in  1945.  From  1946  to  1955,  Honecker  served  as 
chairman  of  the  youth  organization,  the  Free  German  Youth 
(Freie  Deutsche  Jugend — FDJ).  He  became  a  member  of  the 
SED  Politburo  in  1958.  As  secretary  for  security  matters  of  the 
SED  Central  Committee,  Honecker  was  directly  responsible  for 
the  building  of  the  Berlin  Wall  in  1961.  When  Ulbricht  was 
removed  from  power  in  1971,  Honecker  succeeded  him  in  his 
party  functions  and  became  chief  of  the  SED.  Honecker  was 
head  of  state  of  the  GDR  from  1976  until  his  resignation  in 
1989.  After  his  fall  from  power,  Honecker  found  refuge  in  the 
Embassy  of  Chile  in  Moscow  until  his  extradition  to  Berlin  in 
1992,  where  he  was  brought  to  trial.  He  was  released  from  cus- 
tody in  1993  for  health  reasons  and  went  to  Chile,  where  he 
died  in  1994.  Although  less  rigid  than  Ulbricht,  as  evidenced  by 
his  willingness  to  sign  agreements  with  the  West  that  opened 
the  GDR  somewhat  and  made  the  lives  of  its  citizens  easier, 
Honecker  remained  a  convinced  communist  until  his  death. 

The  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe 

Keen  to  gain  international  recognition  of  its  sphere  of  inter- 
est and  believing  that  such  recognition  would  solidify  its  grip 
on  its  East  European  satellite  states,  the  Soviet  Union,  begin- 
ning in  the  early  1970s,  sponsored  an  initiative  calling  for  the 
convening  of  a  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in 
Europe  (CSCE — see  Glossary).  For  the  West,  such  meetings 
meant  the  possibility  of  tying  the  Soviet  Union  and  its  satellites 
to  an  international  security  system,  thereby  lessening  tensions, 
furthering  economic  cooperation,  and  obtaining  humanitarian 
improvements  for  the  people  of  Eastern  Europe.  The  first  of 
the  series  of  conferences  opened  in  July  1973  in  Helsinki  and 
was  attended  by  the  foreign  ministers  of  the  thirty-five  member 
states.  At  the  conference's  final  meeting  in  1975,  the  heads  of 
state  of  all  member  countries  were  in  attendance  for  the  sign- 
ing of  the  Final  Act,  or  the  Helsinki  Accords.

As  subsequent  CSCE  conferences  showed,  Soviet  officials 
had  totally  underestimated  the  effect  of  the  provisions  for  the 
exchange  of  information,  which  allowed  for  the  unscrambled 
reception  of  Western  media  broadcasts  within  the  geographic 
area  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  countries.  East  Germans  benefited 
especially  from  access  to  West  German  radio  and  television  pro- 
grams, which  furnished  previously  unobtainable  news  about 
world  events.  Television  viewers  in  the  East  also  became  aware 
of  an  obviously  far  superior  standard  of  living  in  the  West  and 
developed  a  new  awareness  of  the  deficiencies  of  the  commu- 
nist regime,  an  awareness  that  fifteen  years  later  led  to  the 
events  that  brought  down  that  regime. 

The  New  East  German  Constitution  and  the  Question  of 
Identity 

Although  the  GDR  had  finally  achieved  its  goal  of  interna- 
tional recognition  with  the  signing  of  the  Basic  Treaty  in 
December  1972,  renewed  concerns  about  the  stability  and 
identity  of  the  GDR  as  a  second  German  state  drove  the  SED 
Politburo  toward  a  policy  of  reaffirming  the  socialist  nature  of 
the  state.  As  early  as  1971,  Honecker  had  launched  a  campaign 
to  foster  a  socialist  identity  among  East  Germans  and  to 
counter  West  German  emphasis  on  the  historical  unity  of  the 
German  nation.  In  1974  the  GDR  constitution  was  even 
amended  to  increase  a  sense  of  separate  development.  All  ref- 
erences in  the  document  to  the  "German  nation"  and  to  Ger- 
man national  heritage  were  deleted. 

The  SED  had  long  revised  German  history  to  make  it  con- 
form to  socialist  purposes.  Symbols  of  Prussian  heritage  in  Ber- 
lin, such  as  the  equestrian  statue  of  Prussian  king  Frederick  the 
Great,  had  been  removed.  And  in  1950,  Ulbricht  had  ordered 
the  500-year-old  palace  of  the  Hohenzollern  Dynasty  demol- 
ished because  it  was  a  symbol  of  "feudal  repression." 

Just  as  the  SED  was  striving  to  develop  a  separate  GDR  con- 
sciousness and  loyalty,  however,  the  new  access  to  Western 
media,  arranged  by  the  CSCE  process  and  formalized  in  the 
Helsinki  Accords  of  1975,  was  engendering  a  growing  enthusi- 
asm among  East  Germans  for  West  Germany's  Ostpolitik. 
Honecker  sought  to  counter  this  development  by  devising  a 
new  formula:  "citizenship,  GDR;  nationality,  German."  After 
the  SED's  Ninth  Party  Congress  in  May  1976,  Honecker  went 
one  step  further:  figures  of  Prussian  history,  such  as  the 
reformers  Karl  vom  Stein,  Karl  August  von  Hardenberg,  Ger- 


118 


Historical  Setting:  1945  to  1990 


hard  von  Scharnhorst,  and  the  founder  of  Berlin  Univer- 
sity, Wilhelm  von  Humboldt,  were  rehabilitated  and  claimed  as 
historical  ancestors  of  the  GDR.  Frederick  the  Great  and  Otto 
von  Bismarck  were  also  restored  to  prominence.  Even  Martin 
Luther  was  judged  a  worthy  historical  figure  who  needed  to  be 
understood  within  the  context  of  his  times. 

These  concessions  did  not  alter  the  regime's  harsh  policy 
toward  dissidents,  however.  Primary  targets  were  artists  and 
writers  who  advocated  reforms  and  democratization,  including 
Wolf  Biermann,  a  poet-singer  popular  among  East  German 
youth  who  was  expelled  from  the  GDR  in  1976.  A  wave  of  per- 
secution of  other  dissident  intellectuals  followed.  Some  were 
imprisoned;  others  were  deported  to  West  Germany.  Nonethe- 
less, political  statements  by  East  German  intellectuals,  some 
going  so  far  as  to  advocate  reunification,  continued  to  appear 
anonymously  in  the  West  German  press. 

Relations  Between  the  Two  Germanys 

Although  Honecker  pursued  a  tough  policy  against  internal 
dissidents  and  carefully  guarded  the  GDR's  unique  identity  as 
the  state  in  which  the  old  Marxist  dream  of  socialism  had 
become  a  reality,  he  was  keenly  aware  of  the  necessity  for  com- 
munication and  reasonable  working  relations  with  the  FRG. 
His  dream  of  being  received  at  the  White  House  as  a  guest  of 
state  by  United  States  president  Ronald  Reagan  was  never  real- 
ized, but  Honecker  opened  more  lines  of  communication  to 
Western  politicians  than  had  his  predecessors. 

As  a  consequence  of  the  Helsinki  Accords,  the  reception  of 
Western  news  media  broadcasts  was  tacitly  allowed  in  the  GDR. 
In  the  early  1980s,  it  also  became  possible  for  citizens  of  the 
GDR  who  were  not  yet  pensioners  to  visit  relatives  in  the  West 
in  cases  involving  urgent  family  matters.  Under  a  new  regula- 
tion, refugees  who  had  gone  to  the  West  before  1981  and  had 
therefore  automatically  lost  their  GDR  citizenship  could  now 
enter  the  GDR  with  their  West  German  passport.  These  mea- 
sures benefited  East  Germans  and,  together  with  access  to 
Western  television,  helped  to  create  a  new  relaxed  atmosphere 
in  the  GDR. 

On  the  economic  side,  the  GDR  fully  utilized  the  advantages 
of  the  Interzone  Trading  Agreement,  which  allowed  special 
consideration  for  the  export  of  goods  from  the  GDR  to  the 
FRG  and  other  EC  member  states,  as  well  as  the  import  of  vital 
industrial  products  from  the  West.  Diplomatic  relations  with 


119 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  EC  were  established  in  1988,  a  reversal  of  the  former  policy 
that  saw  the  organization  as  a  threat  to  the  GDR's  sovereignty. 
The  annual  Leipzig  Industrial  Fair  also  provided  a  convenient 
forum  for  meeting  Western  politicians  and  industrialists. 

The  severe  shortage  of  Western  currency  in  the  GDR,  one  of 
the  key  concerns  of  the  SED  leadership,  was  alleviated  by 
agreements  with  the  FRG  that  tripled  the  bulk  contributions  to 
the  East  German  postal  administration  by  the  FRG.  Similar 
agreements,  financially  advantageous  to  the  GDR,  improved 
the  highway  links  to  West  Berlin.  More  significant,  however,  was 
the  granting  of  bank  credits  amounting  to  DM2  billion  to  the 
GDR  during  1983  and  1984.  The  CSU  leader  and  minister  pres- 
ident of  Bavaria,  Franz  Josef  Strauss,  was  the  principal  negotia- 
tor of  these  credit  agreements. 

At  first,  the  credits  appeared  to  yield  positive  results  along 
the  inner-German  border,  where  mines  and  automatic  guns, 
which  had  so  long  posed  a  deadly  threat  to  East  Germans 
attempting  to  flee  to  the  FRG,  were  dismantled.  Later,  however, 
it  became  clear  that  these  devices  had  been  replaced  by  nearly 
impenetrable  electronic  warning  systems  and  with  trained  dogs 
at  certain  sectors  along  the  border.  The  order  to  shoot  at  refu- 
gees was  not  rescinded  but  remained  in  effect  almost  until  the 
end  of  the  GDR  regime.  Also  remaining  in  effect  were  strict 
controls  for  West  German  citizens  at  GDR  border  crossings  and 
on  transit  routes  to  and  from  West  Berlin,  although  there  were 
no  further  reports  of  people  being  abused  at  border  check- 
points. 

However  much  relations  improved  between  the  two  states  in 
some  areas,  the  stance  of  the  SED  leadership  toward  the  FRG's 
NATO  membership  remained  hostile.  Harsh  attacks  in  the  East 
German  press  labeling  the  FRG  as  an  "American  missile 
launcher"  became  more  frequent  during  the  debates  on  the 
stationing  of  Pershing  II  and  cruise  missiles.  On  occasion,  high- 
level  official  visits  were  canceled  to  signal  the  GDR's  opposition 
to  Western  military  policies.  The  FRG  responded  in  kind.  For 
example,  Federal  President  Karl  Carstens  (1979-84)  did  not 
attend  as  planned  the  East  German  celebrations  on  the  occa- 
sion of  the  500th  anniversary  of  the  birth  of  Martin  Luther  in 
1983. 

In  October  1987,  when  the  two  superpowers  were  striving  for 
detente  and  disarmament  and  the  relations  between  the  two 
Germanys  were  cordial,  Honecker  visited  Bonn  as  the  GDR 
head  of  state.  The  visit,  postponed  several  times,  was  in

response  to  Chancellor  Schmidt's  visit  to  East  Germany  in 
1981.  Honecker  was  in  the  West  German  capital  for  an  "official 
working  meeting."  He  signed  agreements  for  cooperation  in 
the  areas  of  science  and  technology,  as  well  as  environmental 
protection.  Honecker's  statement  that  the  border  dividing  the 
two  Germanys  would  one  day  be  seen  as  a  line  "connecting"  the 
two  states,  similar  to  the  border  between  the  GDR  and  Poland, 
attracted  thoughtful  public  attention  in  the  West.  Honecker 
was  cordially  received  by  members  of  the  government,  in  the 
words  of  Federal  President  Richard  von  Weizsacker  (1984-94), 
as  a  "German  among  Germans."  However,  at  various  stages  of 
the  visit — which  subsequently  took  him  to  several  federal  states, 
including  his  native  Saarland — large  numbers  of  demonstra- 
tors chanted,  "The  wall  must  go." 


121 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

The  East  German  media  coverage  of  the  visit  provided  the 
opportunity  for  Chancellor  Kohl  to  speak  to  "all  the  people  in 
Germany"  and  to  call  for  the  breaking  down  of  barriers  "in 
accordance  with  the  wishes  of  the  German  people."  Although 
the  visit  yielded  no  immediate  concrete  results  and  Honecker's 
hopes  of  increased  political  recognition  for  the  GDR  were  not 
realized,  a  dialogue  had  begun  that  could  make  the  division  of 
Germany  more  bearable  for  the  people  involved.  As  of  late 
1987,  however,  there  was  still  little  hope  of  overcoming  the  divi- 
sion itself. 

The  Peace  Movement  and  Internal  Resistance 

The  GDR  leadership  welcomed  protests  against  weapons 
and  war  as  long  as  they  occurred  in  the  FRG.  However,  when  a 
small  group  of  East  German  pacifists  advocating  the  conversion 
of  "swords  into  plowshares"  demonstrated  in  1981  against  the 
presence  of  Soviet  missiles  on  GDR  soil,  as  well  as  against  the 
destruction  of  the  environment  by  the  dumping  of  industrial 
waste  and  the  use  of  nuclear  power  generally,  they  were 
arrested,  prosecuted,  and  in  some  cases  expelled  from  the 
GDR.  Church  organizations  in  the  GDR — considered  subver- 
sive by  their  mere  existence — and  individual  pastors  who  pro- 
tected and  defended  demonstrators  at  risk  to  their  own  safety 
became  targets  of  increased  surveillance  by  the  Stasi,  as  did 
individual  churchgoers,  who  by  1988  were  frequently  arrested 
and  interrogated. 

The  mounting  nervousness  of  the  GDR  leadership  became 
evident  in  June  1987  when  large  crowds  of  East  Berlin  youth 
gathered  on  their  side  of  the  Wall,  along  with  young  people 
from  all  over  the  GDR,  to  hear  two  rock  concerts  being  held  in 
West  Berlin  near  the  Reichstag  building.  When  the  crowd 
broke  into  frenzied  cries  for  freedom  and  unification,  police 
cleared  the  area,  arresting  and  forcibly  removing  Western  news 
reporters  filming  the  incident. 

In  the  local  elections  of  May  17,  1989,  the  "united  list"  led  by 
the  SED  received  98.9  percent  of  the  vote,  obviously  the  result 
of  massive  manipulation,  which  enraged  large  segments  of  the 
population  who  had  previously  remained  silent.  In  the  next 
months,  persistent  public  complaints  against  the  prevailing  liv- 
ing conditions  and  lack  of  basic  freedoms,  voiced  by  church 
groups  and  by  opposition  groups,  inspired  the  population  to 
take  to  the  streets  in  large  numbers.  The  largest  of  the  new 


122

opposition  groups  was  the  New  Forum,  founded  in  September 
1989  by  Barbel  Bohley,  Jens  Reich,  and  others. 

During  the  fall  of  1989,  mass  demonstrations  of  several  hun- 
dred thousand  people  were  taking  place,  first  in  what  soon 
became  traditional  Monday  demonstrations  in  Leipzig  and 
later  in  Berlin  and  other  large  cities.  For  the  first  time,  GDR 
rulers  realized  that  they  were  losing  control:  the  demonstra- 
tions were  too  massive  to  be  quelled  by  intimidation  or  even 
mass  arrests;  and  shooting  at  the  demonstrators  was  out  of  the 
question  because  of  the  sheer  size  of  the  crowds  and  the 
absence  of  Soviet  support  for  draconian  measures. 

Beginning  in  the  summer  of  1989,  the  regime  was  threat- 
ened by  another  development.  Among  the  thousands  of  GDR 
citizens  that  traveled  by  car  on  "vacation"  to  the  socialist 
"brother  country"  Hungary,  some  600  were  successful  in  cross- 
ing illegally  into  Austria,  where  they  were  enthusiastically  wel- 
comed before  traveling  on  to  the  FRG.  Others  wanting  to 
escape  the  GDR  took  refuge  in  the  embassies  of  the  FRG  in 
Budapest,  Prague,  and  Warsaw.  On  September  11,  Hungary 
legalized  travel  over  the  border  to  Austria  for  GDR  citizens 
heading  for  the  FRG,  enabling  15,000  to  take  this  route  within 
a  few  days.  Eventually,  the  GDR  leadership  was  forced  to  allow 
special  trains  to  carry  thousands  of  GDR  refugees  who  had 
received  permission  to  emigrate  to  the  West  after  taking  sanc- 
tuary in  the  FRG's  embassies  in  Prague  and  Warsaw.  As  the 
trains  traveled  through  the  GDR,  many  more  refugees  tried  to 
climb  aboard,  so  the  government  refused  to  further  allow  such 
transports. 

The  Last  Days  of  East  Germany 

In  January  1988,  Honecker  paid  a  state  visit  to  France.  By  all 
indications,  the  long  stretch  of  international  isolation 
appeared  to  have  been  successfully  overcome.  The  GDR  finally 
seemed  to  be  taking  its  long-sought  place  among  the  interna- 
tional community  of  nations.  In  the  minds  of  the  GDR's 
old-guard  communists,  the  long-awaited  international  political 
recognition  was  seen  as  a  favorable  omen  that  seemed  to  coin- 
cide symbolically  with  the  fortieth  anniversary  of  the  East  Ger- 
man state. 

In  spite  of  Honecker's  declaration  as  late  as  January  1989 
that  "The  Wall  will  still  stand  in  fifty  and  also  in  a  hundred 
years,"  the  effects  of  glasnost  and  perestroika  had  begun  to  be  evi- 
dent in  the  Soviet  Union  and  throughout  Eastern  Europe.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Although  the  GDR  leadership  tried  to  deny  the  reality  of  these 
developments,  for  most  East  Germans  the  reforms  of  Soviet 
leader  Gorbachev  were  symbols  of  a  new  era  that  would  inevita- 
bly also  reach  the  GDR.  The  GDR  leadership's  frantic  attempts 
to  block  the  news  coming  out  of  the  Soviet  Union  by  prevent- 
ing the  distribution  of  Russian  newsmagazines  only  strength- 
ened growing  protest  within  the  population. 

In  Berlin,  on  October  7,  the  GDR  leadership  celebrated  the 
fortieth  anniversary  of  the  foundation  of  the  East  German 
state.  In  his  address,  Honecker  sharply  condemned  the  FRG 
for  interfering  in  the  GDR's  internal  affairs  and  for  encourag- 
ing protesters.  Still  convinced  of  his  mission  to  secure  the  sur- 
vival of  the  GDR  as  a  state,  he  proclaimed:  "Socialism  will  be 
halted  in  its  course  neither  by  ox,  nor  ass."  The  prophetic 
retort  by  Gorbachev,  honored  guest  at  the  celebrations,  as 
quoted  to  the  international  press,  more  accurately  reflected 
imminent  realities:  "He  who  comes  too  late  will  suffer  the  con- 
sequences of  history." 

The  consequences  of  not  having  held  in  check  the  earlier 
large  demonstrations  against  the  regime's  inflexibility  came 
two  days  later  when  70,000  protesters  shouting  "We  are  the 
people"  demonstrated  in  Leipzig.  When  the  police  took  no 
action  during  these  historic  hours  of  October  9,  1989,  it 
became  clear  to  everyone  that  the  days  of  the  GDR  were  num- 
bered. After  the  crowds  in  Leipzig  reached  over  100,000  pro- 
testers on  October  16,  the  Central  Committee  of  the  SED — 
previously  kept  in  the  background  by  Honecker  and  his  com- 
rades in  the  party  leadership — took  control.  Honecker 
resigned  from  his  offices  as  head  of  state  and  party  leader  on 
October  18. 

Egon  Krenz,  longtime  member  of  the  Politburo  and  FDJ 
chairman,  became  Honecker's  successor  as  general  secretary  of 
the  SED.  On  October  24,  Krenz  also  assumed  the  chairman- 
ship of  the  Council  of  State.  On  his  orders,  all  police  actions 
against  demonstrators  were  discontinued.  On  November  4,  the 
largest  demonstration  in  GDR  history  took  place,  with  over  1 
million  people  in  East  Berlin  demanding  democracy  and  free 
elections.  Confronted  with  this  wave  of  popular  opposition,  the 
GDR  government,  under  Prime  Minister  Willi  Stoph,  resigned 
on  November  7.  The  Politburo  followed  suit  on  November  8. 
Finally,  on  the  evening  of  November  9,  Politburo  member 
Gunter  Schabowski  announced  the  opening  of  the  border 
crossings  into  the  FRG.

Opening  of  the  Berlin  Wall  and  Unification 

November  9,  1989,  will  be  remembered  as  one  of  the  great 
moments  of  German  history.  On  that  day,  the  dreadful  Berlin 
Wall,  which  for  twenty-eight  years  had  been  the  symbol  of  Ger- 
man division,  cutting  through  the  heart  of  the  old  capital  city, 
was  unexpectedly  opened  by  GDR  border  police.  In  joyful  dis- 
belief, Germans  from  both  sides  climbed  up  on  the  Wall,  which 
had  been  called  "the  ugliest  edifice  in  the  world."  They 
embraced  each  other  and  sang  and  danced  in  the  streets.  Some 
began  chiseling  away  chips  of  the  Wall  as  if  to  have  a  personal 
hand  in  tearing  it  down,  or  at  least  to  carry  away  a  piece  of  Ger- 
man history.  East  Germans  immediately  began  pouring  into 
West  Germany.  Within  a  few  days,  over  1  million  persons  per 
day  had  seized  the  chance  to  see  their  western  neighbor  first- 
hand.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

On  November  13,  Hans  Modrow  was  elected  minister  presi- 
dent of  the  GDR.  After  Chancellor  Kohl  had  presented  his 
Ten-Point  Plan  for  the  step-by-step  unification  of  Germany  to 
the  Bundestag  on  November  28,  the  Volkskammer  struck  the 
leadership  role  of  the  SED  from  the  constitution  of  the  GDR 
on  December  1  (see  Unification,  ch.  8).  The  SED  Politburo 
resigned  on  December  3,  and  Krenz  stepped  down  as  chairman 
of  the  Council  of  State  on  December  6.  One  day  later,  the 
Round  Table  talks  started  among  the  SED,  the  GDR's  other 
political  parties,  and  the  opposition.  On  December  22,  the 
Brandenburg  Gate  in  Berlin  was  opened  for  pedestrian  traffic. 

During  January  1990,  negotiations  at  the  Round  Table  con- 
tinued. Free  elections  to  the  Volkskammer  were  scheduled  for 
March  18.  The  conservative  opposition,  under  CDU  leader- 
ship, waged  a  joint  campaign  under  the  banner  of  the  Alliance 
for  Germany,  consisting  of  the  CDU,  the  German  Social  Union 
(Deutsche  Soziale  Union — DSU),  a  sister  party  of  the  CSU,  and 
the  Democratic  Awakening  (Demokratischer  Aufbruch — DA). 
The  elections  on  March  18  produced  a  clear  majority  for  the 
Alliance  for  Germany.  On  April  12,  a  CDU  politician,  Lothar 
de  Maiziere,  was  elected  the  new  minister  president. 

The  unusually  poor  showing  of  the  SPD  in  these  final  East 
German  elections  may  be  explained  by  the  party's  reluctance  to 
support  German  unification  and  also  by  the  fact  that  the  public 
was  aware  of  the  close  contacts  that  the  SPD  leadership  had 
maintained  with  the  SED  over  the  years.  The  success  of  the 
conservative  parties  was  repeated  in  the  communal  elections 
on  May  6,  which  were  seen  as  a  correction  to  the  manipulated 
vote  of  the  previous  year. 

As  a  precondition  for  German  unity,  the  Two-Plus-Four  Talks 
among  the  two  German  governments  and  the  four  victorious 
powers  of  World  War  II  began  on  May  5.  Held  in  four  sessions, 
the  last  of  which  was  on  September  12,  the  talks  culminated  in 
the  signing  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Final  Settlement  with  Respect 
to  Germany  (the  Two-Plus-Four  Treaty).  These  talks  settled 
questions  relating  to  the  eastern  border  of  Germany,  the 
strength  of  Germany's  military  forces,  and  the  schedule  of 
Allied  troop  withdrawal  from  German  soil. 

During  a  visit  to  Moscow  in  early  February,  Chancellor  Kohl 
had  received  assurances  from  Gorbachev  that  the  Soviet  Union 
would  respect  the  wishes  of  both  Germanys  to  unite.  Kohl  real- 
ized that  in  order  to  seize  this  historic  opportunity  for  Ger- 
many, swift  action  and  final  determination  were  crucial.  In  a

cordial  meeting  between  Gorbachev  and  Chancellor  Kohl  on 
July  16,  unified  Germany's  membership  in  NATO  and  its  full 
sovereignty  were  conceded  by  the  Soviet  president. 

The  first  concrete  step  toward  unification  was  the  monetary, 
economic,  and  social  union  of  West  Germany  and  East  Ger- 
many on  July  1,  as  had  been  agreed  in  May  in  a  treaty  between 
the  two  German  states.  The  monetary  union  introduced  the 
deutsche  mark  into  East  Germany.  Although  there  had  been 
concern  about  the  GDR's  precarious  financial  situation,  the 
full  extent  of  the  disastrous  consequences  of  forty  years  of  com- 
munist rule  only  came  to  light  in  the  summer  of  1990.  It  was 
soon  clear  that  the  first  massive  aid  package  for  the  East  Ger- 
man economy,  comprising  DM115  billion,  was  just  the  begin- 
ning of  a  long  and  expensive  rebuilding  of  a  country  reduced 
to  shambles  by  the  SEE). 

Divided  by  futile  discussions  about  the  speed  of  unification, 
the  new  government  coalition  in  East  Berlin  had  begun  to  fall 
apart  duringjuly  1990,  when  its  SPD  members  resigned.  Per- 
suaded by  the  mounting  economic  and  social  problems  that 
unification  was  necessary,  the  Volkskammer  finally  agreed  on 
October  3,  1990,  as  the  date  of  German  unification. 

On  the  occasion  of  the  first  free  elections  in  the  GDR,  Chan- 
cellor Kohl  took  the  opportunity  to  publicly  express  his  grati- 
tude to  the  United  States,  which  had  been  Germany's  most 
reliable  ally  during  the  process  of  unification.  Once  the  first 
prerequisite  for  future  unification  had  been  established, 
namely,  the  willingness  of  Gorbachev  to  consider  negotiations 
on  unification  in  light  of  the  dramatic  events  of  the  fall  of  1989, 
the  consent  of  the  other  victorious  powers  had  to  be  secured. 

Statements  voicing  concerns  and  even  fears  of  a  reemer- 
gence  of  an  aggressive  unified  Germany  suddenly  appeared  in 
the  international  press  and  media,  as  well  as  in  unofficial 
remarks  made  by  political  figures  throughout  Europe.  Even  the 
FRG's  major  NATO  partners  in  Europe — Britain  and  France — 
had  become  rather  comfortable  with  the  prevailing  situation, 
that  is,  being  allied  with  an  economically  potent,  but  politically 
weak,  semisovereign  West  Germany. 

Although  lip  service  in  support  of  future  unification  of  Ger- 
many was  common  in  the  postwar  era,  no  one  dreamed  of  its 
eventual  realization.  When  the  historic  constellation  allowing 
unification  appeared,  swift  and  decisive  action  on  the  part  of 
Chancellor  Kohl  and  the  unwavering,  strong  support  given  by 
the  United  States  government  for  the  early  completion  of  the 


127 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

unification  process  were  key  elements  in  surmounting  the  last 
hurdles  during  the  final  phase  of  the  Two-Plus-Four  Talks. 

The  unification  treaty,  consisting  of  more  than  1,000  pages, 
was  approved  by  a  large  majority  in  the  Bundestag  and  the 
Volkskammer  on  September  20,  1990.  After  this  last  procedural 
step,  nothing  stood  in  the  way  of  formal  unification.  At  mid- 
night on  October  3,  the  German  Democratic  Republic  joined 
the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany.  Unification  celebrations 
were  held  all  over  Germany,  especially  in  Berlin,  where  leading 
political  figures  from  West  and  East  joined  the  joyful  crowds 
who  filled  the  streets  between  the  Reichstag  building  and  Alex- 
anderplatz  to  watch  a  fireworks  display.  Germans  celebrated 
unity  without  a  hint  of  nationalistic  pathos,  but  with  dignity 
and  in  an  atmosphere  reminiscent  of  a  country  fair.  Yet  the 
world  realized  that  an  historic  epoch  had  come  to  a  peaceful 
end.

Chapter  3.  The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Cologne  Cathedral,  begun  in  1248,  was  completed  only  in  1880. 


THE  OPENING  OF  THE  BERLIN  WALL  on  November  9, 
1989,  was  one  of  the  most  dramatic  events  of  the  post-World 
War  II  period.  In  the  ensuing  months,  much  more  than  just  the 
graffiti-covered  concrete  panels  of  that  infamous  structure 
came  crashing  down  during  carnival-like  celebrations.  After 
four  decades,  the  division  of  an  entire  continent,  a  nation,  and 
a  society  came  to  an  abrupt  end. 

A  powerful  force  setting  the  revolutionary  change  in  motion 
was  a  substantial  movement  of  people  from  the  German  Demo- 
cratic Republic  (GDR,  or  East  Germany)  westward.  Through- 
out its  forty-year  history,  the  GDR  had  resorted  to  extreme 
measures  to  control  its  borders  and  halt  the  exodus  of  produc- 
tive workers.  The  most  extreme  of  these  measures  was  the  erec- 
tion in  1961  of  the  Berlin  Wall  to  check  the  sustained 
movement  of  East  Germans  to  the  Federal  Republic  of  Ger- 
many (FRG,  or  West  Germany),  whose  booming  economy  had 
created  millions  of  new  jobs.  Nearly  three  decades  later,  for  a 
period  of  several  years  beginning  in  the  summer  of  1989,  the 
appeal  of  West  Germany,  even  with  its  economy  mired  in  reces- 
sion, prompted  another  wave  of  migration  of  more  than 
700,000  East  Germans,  most  between  the  ages  of  eighteen  and 
thirty. 

The  FRG's  absorption  of  the  GDR  in  1990  enlarged  its  area 
by  about  30  percent  and  increased  its  population  about  20  per- 
cent. Integrating  this  new  territory  has  proven  to  be  a  Her- 
culean task.  Prior  to  unification,  West  Germans  enjoyed  one  of 
the  highest  standards  of  living  in  the  world  and  a  per  capita 
income  exceeding  that  of  the  United  States.  East  Germans 
were  prosperous  by  the  standards  of  the  communist  world  but 
had  a  living  standard  considerably  below  that  of  Western 
Europe.  As  the  costs  of  unification  have  accumulated,  the  time 
when  easterners  will  attain  the  standard  of  living  of  westerners 
has  receded  further  into  the  future. 

In  the  early  1990s,  the  five  new  eastern  states  (Lander,  sing., 
Land)  experienced  substantial  depopulation  as  a  result  of  a 
plummeting  birth  rate  and  the  internal  migration  of  eastern 
Germans  to  the  west.  All  social  groups  in  the  east  were  affected 
by  the  hasty  merger,  but  the  position  of  women  was  even  more 
negatively  affected.  In  particular,  the  rapid  privatization  of  the 
socialist  command  economy  led  to  much  unemployment 


133 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

among  women  and  the  dismantling  of  an  extensive  child-care 
system.  The  east's  elderly,  who  generally  had  incomes  and  sav- 
ings much  below  their  counterparts  in  the  western  Lander,  also 
suffered  hardship. 

Unification  inevitably  revealed  a  series  of  unpleasant  sur- 
prises about  the  closed  economy  and  society  of  what  had  been 
East  Germany.  One  of  the  most  distressing  was  the  deplorable 
state  of  the  environment.  Among  the  world's  most  environmen- 
tally conscious  peoples,  West  Germans  were  shocked  by  the  lev- 
els  of  ecological  damage  in  the  east.  Environmental 
degradation,  most  noticeably  badly  polluted  air  and  water,  was 
perhaps  a  more  important  cause  of  the  inequalities  in  living 
standards  between  east  and  west  than  smaller  living  quarters 
and  lower  wages.  Surveying  the  dilapidated  infrastructure  and 
housing  stock,  observers  dubbed  the  newly  incorporated  terri- 
tory "Germany's  Appalachia." 

By  mid-1995  it  appeared  that  the  physical  and  administrative 
mergers  of  the  two  German  states  would  be  far  easier  to  accom- 
plish than  the  social  aspect  of  the  union.  In  the  postwar  period, 
the  two  Germanys  had  assiduously  developed  two  mutually 
exclusive  models  of  society.  Thus,  the  major  challenge  lay  in 
harmonizing  and  integrating  these  societies,  which  were  only 
gradually  emerging  from  the  long  shadows  cast  by  four  decades 
of  separate  development  in  antagonistic  systems. 

Physical  Setting 

Roughly  the  size  of  Montana  and  situated  even  farther 
north,  unified  Germany  has  an  area  of  356,959  square  kilome- 
ters. Extending  853  kilometers  from  its  northern  border  with 
Denmark  to  the  Alps  in  the  south,  it  is  the  sixth  largest  country 
in  Europe.  At  its  widest,  Germany  measures  approximately  650 
kilometers  from  the  Belgian-German  border  in  the  west  to  the 
Polish  frontier  in  the  east. 

The  territory  of  the  former  East  Germany  (divided  into  five 
new  Lander  in  1990)  accounts  for  almost  one-third  of  united 
Germany's  territory  and  one-fifth  of  its  population.  After  a 
close  vote,  in  1993  the  Bundestag,  the  lower  house  of  Ger- 
many's parliament,  voted  to  transfer  the  capital  from  Bonn  in 
the  west  to  Berlin,  a  city-state  in  the  east  surrounded  by  the 
Land  of  Brandenburg.  The  relocation  process  is  expected  to  be 
concluded  by  about  the  year  2000,  following  the  transfer  of  the 
Bundestag,  the  Bundesrat,  the  Chancellory,  and  ten  of  the 
eighteen  federal  ministries.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Topography 

With  its  irregular,  elongated  shape,  Germany  provides  an 
excellent  example  of  a  recurring  sequence  of  landforms  found 
the  world  over.  A  plain  dotted  with  lakes,  moors,  marshes,  and 
heaths  retreats  from  the  sea  and  reaches  inland,  where  it 
becomes  a  landscape  of  hills  crisscrossed  by  streams,  rivers,  and 
valleys.  These  hills  lead  upward,  gradually  forming  high  pla- 
teaus and  woodlands  and  eventually  climaxing  in  spectacular 
mountain  ranges. 

As  of  the  mid-1990s,  about  37  percent  of  the  country's  area 
was  arable;  17  percent  consisted  of  meadows  and  pastures;  30 
percent  was  forests  and  woodlands;  and  16  percent  was  devoted 
to  other  uses.  Geographers  often  divide  Germany  into  four  dis- 
tinct topographic  regions:  the  North  German  Lowland;  the 
Central  German  Uplands;  Southern  Germany;  and  the  Alpine 
Foreland  and  the  Alps  (see  fig.  7). 

North  German  Lowland 

The  North  German  Lowland  is  a  part  of  the  Great  European 
Plain  that  sweeps  across  Europe  from  the  Pyrenees  in  France  to 
the  Ural  Mountains  in  Russia.  All  of  the  Lander  of  Schleswig- 
Holstein,  Hamburg,  Bremen,  Mecklenburg-Western  Pomera- 
nia,  Brandenburg,  Berlin,  most  of  Lower  Saxony  and  Saxony- 
Anhalt,  and  parts  of  Saxony  and  North  Rhine-Westphalia  are 
located  in  this  region. 

Hills  in  the  lowland  only  rarely  reach  200  meters  in  height, 
and  most  of  the  region  is  well  under  100  meters  above  sea  level. 
The  lowlands  slope  almost  imperceptibly  toward  the  sea.  The 
North  Sea  portion  of  the  coastline  is  devoid  of  cliffs  and  has 
wide  expanses  of  sand,  marsh,  and  mud  flats  (Watten) .  The 
mud  flats  between  the  Elbe  estuary  and  the  Netherlands  bor- 
der are  believed  to  have  been  above  sea  level  during  Roman 
history  and  to  have  been  inundated  when  the  shoreline  sank 
during  the  thirteenth  century.  In  the  western  area,  the  former 
line  of  inshore  sand  dunes  became  the  East  Frisian  Islands.  The 
mud  flats  between  the  islands  and  the  shore  are  exposed  at 
very  low  tides  and  are  crossed  by  innumerable  channels  vary- 
ing in  size  from  those  cut  by  small  creeks  to  those  serving  as  the 
estuaries  of  the  Elbe  and  Weser  rivers.  The  mud  and  sand  are 
constantly  shifting,  and  all  harbor  and  shipping  channels 
require  continuing  maintenance. 

The  offshore  islands  have  maximum  elevations  of  fewer  than 
thirty-five  meters  and  have  been  subject  to  eroding  forces  that 


135 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

have  washed  away  whole  sections  during  severe  storms.  Shore- 
lines most  subject  to  eroding  tides  were  stabilized  during  the 
late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries. 

Although  the  East  Frisian  Islands  are  strung  along  the  coast 
in  a  nearly  straight  line,  the  North  Frisian  Islands  are  irregu- 
larly shaped  and  are  haphazardly  positioned.  They  were  also 
once  a  part  of  the  mainland,  and  a  large  portion  of  the  mud 
flats  between  the  islands  and  the  coast  is  exposed  during  low 
tides. 

The  Baltic  Sea  coast  of  Schleswig-Holstein  differs  markedly 
from  its  North  Sea  coast.  It  is  indented  by  a  number  of  small, 
deep  fjords  with  steep  banks,  which  were  carved  by  rivers  when 
the  land  was  covered  with  glacial  ice.  Farther  to  the  east,  the 
Baltic  shore  is  flat  and  sandy.  Rvigen,  Germany's  largest  island, 
lies  just  offshore  of  Stralsund. 

Wherever  the  region's  terrain  is  rolling  and  drainage  is  satis- 
factory, the  land  is  highly  productive.  This  is  especially  true  of 
the  areas  that  contain  a  very  fertile  siltlike  loess  soil,  better  than 
most  German  soils.  Such  areas,  called  Borden  (sing.,  Borde),  are 
located  along  the  southern  edge  of  the  North  German  Low- 
land beginning  west  of  the  Rhine  near  the  Ruhr  Valley  and 
extending  eastward  and  into  the  Leipzig  Basin.  The  Magde- 
burg Borde  is  the  best  known  of  these  areas.  Other  Borden  are 
located  near  Frankfurt  am  Main,  northern  Baden-Wurttem- 
berg,  and  in  an  area  to  the  north  of  Ulm  and  Munich.  Because 
the  areas  with  loess  soil  also  have  a  moderate  continental  cli- 
mate with  a  long  growing  season,  they  are  considered  Ger- 
many's breadbasket. 

Central  German  Uplands 

The  Central  German  Uplands  are  Germany's  portion  of  the 
Central  European  Uplands;  they  extend  from  the  Massif  Cen- 
tral in  France  to  Poland  and  the  Czech  Republic.  Germany's 
uplands  are  generally  moderate  in  height  and  seldom  reach 
elevations  above  1,100  meters.  The  region  encompasses  all  of 
the  Saarland,  Hesse,  and  Thuringia;  the  north  of  Rhineland- 
Palatinate;  substantial  southern  portions  of  North  Rhine-West- 
phalia, Lower  Saxony,  and  Saxony-Anhalt;  and  western  parts  of 
Saxony. 

In  the  west,  the  Central  German  Uplands  begin  with  the 
Rheinish  Uplands,  a  massive  rectangular  block  of  slate  and 
shale  with  a  gently  rolling  plateau  of  about  400  meters  in  eleva- 
tion and  peaks  of  about  800  to  900  meters.  The  Rheinish 


136 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Uplands  are  divided  by  two  deep  and  dramatic  river  valleys — 
the  Moselle  and  the  Rhine.  The  high  hilly  area  to  the  south  of 
the  Moselle  is  the  Hunsruck;  the  one  to  its  north  is  the  Eifel. 
The  Rhine  separates  these  areas  from  their  extensions  to  the 
east,  the  Taunus,  and,  to  the  north,  the  Westerwald.  To  the 
north  and  east  of  the  Westerwald  are  further  distinct  areas  of 
the  Rheinish  Uplands,  most  notably  the  small  range  of  hills 
known  as  the  Siebengebirge,  across  the  Rhine  from  Bonn,  and 
the  larger  hilly  regions — the  Siegerland,  Bergishes  Land, 
Sauerland,  and  the  Rothaargebirge.  The  higher  elevations  of 
the  Rheinish  Uplands  are  heavily  forested;  lower-lying  areas  are 
well  suited  for  the  growing  of  grain,  fruit,  and  early  potatoes. 

Because  of  the  low  elevations  of  its  valleys  (200  to  350 
meters),  the  Uplands  of  Hesse  provide  an  easily  traveled  pas- 
sageway through  the  Central  German  Uplands.  Although  not 
as  dramatic  as  the  Rhine  Valley,  for  hundreds  of  years  this  pas- 
sageway— the  so-called  Hessian  Corridor — has  been  an  impor- 
tant route  between  the  south  and  the  north,  with  Frankfurt  am 
Main  at  one  end  and  Hanover  at  the  other,  and  Kassel  on  the 
Weser  River  in  its  center.  The  headwaters  of  the  Weser  have  cre- 
ated a  number  of  narrow  but  fertile  valleys.  The  highlands  of 
the  Uplands  of  Hesse  are  volcanic  in  origin.  The  most  notable 
of  these  volcanic  highlands  are  the  Rhon  (950  meters)  and  the 
Vogelsburg  (774  meters). 

To  the  north  of  the  Uplands  of  Hesse  lie  two  low  ranges,  the 
Teutoburger  Wald  and  the  Wiehengebirge,  which  are  the 
northernmost  fringes  of  the  Central  German  Uplands.  It  is  at 
the  Porta  Westfalica  near  Minden  that  the  Weser  River  breaks 
through  the  latter  range  to  reach  the  North  German  Lowland. 

One  of  the  highest  points  in  the  Central  German  Uplands  is 
atBrocken  (1,142  meters)  in  the  Harz  Mountains.  This  range  is 
situated  about  forty  kilometers  to  the  northeast  of  Gottingen 
and  forms  the  northwestern  boundary  of  the  Leipzig  Basin,  an 
extension  of  the  North  German  Lowland.  The  Harz  are  still 
largely  forested  at  lower  levels;  barren  moors  cover  higher  ele- 
vations. An  important  center  for  tourism  in  the  1990s,  the 
range  was  once  an  important  source  for  many  minerals. 

The  Thuringer  Wald,  located  in  southwestern  Thuringia,  is  a 
narrow  range  about  100  kilometers  long,  with  its  highest  point 
just  under  1,000  meters.  Running  in  a  northwesterly  direction, 
it  links  the  Central  German  Uplands  with  the  Bohemian  Massif 
of  the  Czech  Republic  and  forms  the  southwestern  boundary 
of  the  Leipzig  Basin.  The  basin's  southeastern  boundary  is

Uplands  are  divided  by  two  deep  and  dramatic  river  valleys — 
the  Moselle  and  the  Rhine.  The  high  hilly  area  to  the  south  of 
the  Moselle  is  the  Hunsrvick;  the  one  to  its  north  is  the  Eifel. 
The  Rhine  separates  these  areas  from  their  extensions  to  the 
east,  the  Taunus,  and,  to  the  north,  the  Westerwald.  To  the 
north  and  east  of  the  Westerwald  are  further  distinct  areas  of 
the  Rheinish  Uplands,  most  notably  the  small  range  of  hills 
known  as  the  Siebengebirge,  across  the  Rhine  from  Bonn,  and 
the  larger  hilly  regions — the  Siegerland,  Bergishes  Land, 
Sauerland,  and  the  Rothaargebirge.  The  higher  elevations  of 
the  Rheinish  Uplands  are  heavily  forested;  lower-lying  areas  are 
well  suited  for  the  growing  of  grain,  fruit,  and  early  potatoes. 

Because  of  the  low  elevations  of  its  valleys  (200  to  350 
meters),  the  Uplands  of  Hesse  provide  an  easily  traveled  pas- 
sageway through  the  Central  German  Uplands.  Although  not 
as  dramatic  as  the  Rhine  Valley,  for  hundreds  of  years  this  pas- 
sageway— the  so-called  Hessian  Corridor — has  been  an  impor- 
tant route  between  the  south  and  the  north,  with  Frankfurt  am 
Main  at  one  end  and  Hanover  at  the  other,  and  Kassel  on  the 
Weser  River  in  its  center.  The  headwaters  of  the  Weser  have  cre- 
ated a  number  of  narrow  but  fertile  valleys.  The  highlands  of 
the  Uplands  of  Hesse  are  volcanic  in  origin.  The  most  notable 
of  these  volcanic  highlands  are  the  Rhon  (950  meters)  and  the 
Vogelsburg  (774  meters). 

To  the  north  of  the  Uplands  of  Hesse  lie  two  low  ranges,  the 
Teutoburger  Wald  and  the  Wiehengebirge,  which  are  the 
northernmost  fringes  of  the  Central  German  Uplands.  It  is  at 
the  Porta  Westfalica  near  Minden  that  the  Weser  River  breaks 
through  the  latter  range  to  reach  the  North  German  Lowland. 

One  of  the  highest  points  in  the  Central  German  Uplands  is 
at  Brocken  (1,142  meters)  in  the  Harz  Mountains.  This  range  is 
situated  about  forty  kilometers  to  the  northeast  of  Gottingen 
and  forms  the  northwestern  boundary  of  the  Leipzig  Basin,  an 
extension  of  the  North  German  Lowland.  The  Harz  are  still 
largely  forested  at  lower  levels;  barren  moors  cover  higher  ele- 
vations. An  important  center  for  tourism  in  the  1990s,  the 
range  was  once  an  important  source  for  many  minerals. 

The  Thuringer  Wald,  located  in  southwestern  Thuringia,  is  a 
narrow  range  about  100  kilometers  long,  with  its  highest  point 
just  under  1,000  meters.  Running  in  a  northwesterly  direction, 
it  links  the  Central  German  Uplands  with  the  Bohemian  Massif 
of  the  Czech  Republic  and  forms  the  southwestern  boundary 
of  the  Leipzig  Basin.  The  basin's  southeastern  boundary  is

formed  by  the  Erzgebirge  range,  which  extends  to  the  north- 
east at  a  right  angle  to  the  Thuringer  Wald.  Part  of  the  Bohe- 
mian Massif,  the  Erzgebirge  range  reaches  1,214  meters  at  its 
highest  point. 

The  southeasternmost  portion  of  the  Central  German 
Uplands  consists  of  the  Bohemian  Forest  and  the  much  smaller 
Bavarian  Forest.  Both  ranges  belong  to  the  Bohemian  Massif. 
The  Bohemian  Forest,  with  heights  up  to  1,450  meters,  forms  a 
natural  boundary  between  Germany  and  the  Czech  Republic. 

Southern  Germany 

Between  the  Central  German  Uplands  and  the  Alpine  Fore- 
land and  the  Alps  lies  the  geographical  region  of  Southern 
Germany,  which  includes  most  of  Baden-Wurttemberg,  much 
of  northern  Bavaria,  and  portions  of  Hesse  and  Rhineland- 
Palatinate.  The  Main  River  runs  through  the  northern  portion 
of  this  region.  The  Upper  Rhine  River  Valley,  nearly  300  kilo- 
meters long  and  about  fifty  kilometers  wide,  serves  as  its  west- 
ern boundary.  The  Rhine's  wide  river  valley  here  is  in  sharp 
contrast  to  its  high  narrow  valley  in  the  Rheinish  Uplands.  The 
southern  boundaries  of  the  region  of  Southern  Germany  are 
formed  by  extensions  of  the  Jura  Mountains  of  France  and 
Switzerland.  These  ranges  are  separate  from  those  of  the  Cen- 
tral German  Uplands.  One  of  these  Jura  ranges  forms  the 
Black  Forest,  whose  highest  peak  is  the  Feldberg  at  1,493 
meters,  and,  continuing  north,  the  less  elevated  Odenwald  and 
Spessart  hills.  Another  Jura  range  forms  the  Swabian  Alb  (see 
Glossary)  and  its  continuation,  the  Franconian  Alb.  Up  to 
1,000  meters  in  height  and  approximately  forty  kilometers 
wide,  the  two  albs  form  a  long  arc — 400  kilometers  long — from 
the  southern  end  of  the  Black  Forest  to  near  Bayreuth  and  the 
hills  of  the  Frankenwald  region,  which  is  part  of  the  Central 
German  Uplands.  The  Hardt  Mountains  in  Rhineland-Palati- 
nate,  located  to  the  west  of  the  Rhine,  are  also  an  offshoot  of 
the  Jura  Mountains. 

The  landscape  of  the  Southern  Germany  region  is  often  that 
of  scarp  and  vale,  with  the  eroded  sandstone  and  limestone 
scarps  facing  to  the  northwest.  The  lowland  terraces  of  the 
Rhine,  Main,  and  Neckar  river  valleys,  with  their  dry  and  warm 
climate,  are  suitable  for  agriculture  and  are  highly  productive. 
The  loess  and  loam  soils  of  the  Rhine-Main  Plain  are  cultivated 
extensively,  and  orchards  and  vineyards  flourish.  The 
Rhine-Main  Plain  is  densely  populated,  and  Frankfurt  am

Main,  at  its  center,  serves  both  as  Germany's  financial  capital 
and  as  a  major  European  transportation  hub. 

Alpine  Foreland  and  the  Alps 

The  Alpine  Foreland  makes  up  most  of  Bavaria  and  a  good 
part  of  Baden-Wurttemberg.  The  foreland  is  roughly  triangular 
in  shape,  about  400  kilometers  long  from  west  to  east  with  a 
maximum  width  of  about  150  kilometers  north  to  south,  and  is 
bounded  by  Lake  Constance  and  the  Alps  to  the  south,  the 
Swabian  and  Franconian  albs  to  the  north,  and  the  Bavarian 
Forest  to  the  east.  Elevation  within  the  foreland  rises  gently 
from  about  400  meters  near  the  Danube,  which  flows  along  its 
north,  to  about  750  meters  at  the  beginning  of  the  Alpine  foot- 
hills. With  the  exception  of  Munich  and  the  small  cities  of 
Augsburg,  Ingolstadt,  and  Ulm,  the  foreland  is  primarily  rural. 
Soils  are  generally  poor,  with  the  exception  of  some  areas  with 
loess  soil,  and  much  of  the  region  is  pasture  or  is  sown  to  hardy 
crops. 

Germany's  portion  of  the  Alps  accounts  for  a  very  small  part 
of  the  country's  area  and  consists  only  of  a  narrow  fringe  of 
mountains  that  runs  along  the  country's  border  with  Switzer- 
land and  Austria  from  Lake  Constance  in  the  west  to  Salzburg, 
Austria,  in  the  east.  The  western  section  of  the  German  Alps 
are  the  Algauer  Alps,  located  between  Lake  Constance  and  the 
Lech  River.  The  Bavarian  Alps,  the  central  section,  lie  between 
the  Lech  and  Inn  rivers  and  contain  Germany's  highest  peak, 
the  Zugspitze  (2,963  meters).  The  Salzburg  Alps,  which  begin 
at  the  Inn  River  and  encircle  Berchtesgaden,  make  up  the  east- 
ernmost section  of  Germany's  Alps. 

Drainage 

The  greater  part  of  the  country  drains  into  the  North  Sea  via 
the  Rhine,  Ems,  Weser,  and  Elbe  rivers,  which  flow  in  a  north- 
northwest  direction.  In  the  east,  the  Oder  River  and  its  tribu- 
tary, the  Neisse  River,  flow  northward  into  the  Baltic  Sea  and 
mark  the  border  with  Poland.  With  the  exception  of  the  Lahn 
River,  which  flows  southward  before  joining  the  Rhine,  most  of 
the  tributaries  of  these  rivers  flow  in  a  west-to-east  or  east-to- 
west  direction.  In  an  exception  to  the  south-north  pattern  of 
major  rivers,  the  Danube  River  rises  in  the  Black  Forest  and 
flows  in  a  southeasterly  direction,  traversing  Bavaria  before 
crossing  into  Austria  at  Passau  on  the  long  journey  to  the  Black

Sea.  The  Iller,  Lech,  Isar,  and  Inn  rivers  flow  from  the  south 
into  the  Danube  and  drain  the  Alpine  Foreland. 

The  Rhine,  Germany's  longest  and  most  important  river, 
originates  in  Switzerland,  from  where  it  flows  into  Lake  Con- 
stance (actually  a  river  basin).  At  the  lake's  west  end,  it  begins  a 
long  course  (800  kilometers)  to  the  Netherlands,  at  first  mark- 
ing the  boundary  between  Germany  and  Switzerland  and  later 
that  between  Germany  and  France.  Of  the  Rhine's  three  most 
important  tributaries,  the  Moselle  River  drains  parts  of  the 
Rheinish  Uplands,  the  Main  drains  areas  between  the  Central 
German  Uplands  and  the  Franconian  Alb,  and  the  Neckar 
River  drains  the  area  between  the  Black  Forest  and  the  Swabian 
Alb.  Because  these  rivers  keep  the  Rhine  high  during  the  win- 
ter and  because  melting  snow  in  the  Alps  keeps  it  high  during 
the  spring  and  summer,  the  river  generally  has  a  high  steady 
flow,  which  accounts  for  its  being  the  busiest  waterway  in 
Europe. 

Climate 

Although  located  mostly  at  latitudes  north  of  the  United 
States-Canadian  border  and  thus  closer  to  the  Arctic  Circle 
than  to  the  equator,  Germany's  climate  is  moderate  and  is  gen- 
erally without  sustained  periods  of  cold  or  heat.  Northwestern 
and  coastal  Germany  have  a  maritime  climate  caused  by  warm 
westerly  winds  from  the  North  Sea;  the  climate  is  characterized 
by  warm  summers  and  mild  cloudy  winters.  Farther  inland,  the 
climate  is  continental,  marked  by  greater  diurnal  and  seasonal 
variations  in  temperature,  with  warmer  summers  and  colder 
winters. 

In  addition  to  the  maritime  and  continental  climates  that 
predominate  over  most  of  the  country,  the  Alpine  regions  in 
the  extreme  south  and,  to  a  lesser  degree,  some  areas  of  the 
Central  German  Uplands  have  a  so-called  mountain  climate. 
This  climate  is  characterized  by  lower  temperatures  because  of 
higher  altitudes  and  greater  precipitation  caused  by  air  becom- 
ing moisture-laden  as  it  lifts  over  higher  terrain. 

The  major  air  masses  contributing  to  the  maritime  weather 
are  the  Icelandic  low-pressure  system  and  the  Azores  high-pres- 
sure system.  The  Icelandic  lows  rotate  in  a  counterclockwise 
direction  and  tend  to  move  to  the  east  and  southeast  as  they 
approach  Europe.  The  Azores  highs  move  eastward  and  rotate 
in  a  clockwise  direction.  Both  of  these  air  masses  furnish  West-

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

ern  Europe  with  moisture-laden  clouds  propelled  by  westerly 
winds. 

The  northern  lowlands  frequently  experience  a  situation 
(more  often  during  the  winter  months)  when  they  are  between 
these  air  masses  and  are  simultaneously  influenced  by  both.  At 
such  times,  winds  come  from  the  west  and  are  usually  strong. 
When  only  one  of  the  systems  is  dominant,  it  is  more  often  the 
Icelandic  low.  In  spite  of  their  nearly  polar  origin,  Icelandic 
lows  are  warmed  by  the  Gulf  Stream,  and  areas  on  the  coun- 
try's North  Sea  coast  have  midwinter  temperatures  averaging 
more  than  1.6°  C.  This  temperature  is  more  than  three  degrees 
above  the  average  for  the  latitude,  which  is  shared  by  central 
Labrador  and  some  bitterly  cold  regions  in  Siberia. 

When  continental  weather  systems  originating  to  the  east  are 
responsible  for  the  weather,  conditions  are  markedly  different. 
In  the  winter  months,  these  systems  have  high-pressure  air 
masses  that  bring  bright,  clear,  cold  weather.  The  local  people 
describe  these  air  masses  as  Siberian  highs  and  usually  expect 
them  to  last  for  about  two  weeks.  An  occasional  condition 
called  John,  or  warm  wind,  arises  when  the  center  of  a  low-pres- 
sure system  deviates  to  the  south  of  its  usual  path  and  crosses 
the  central  part  of  the  country.  In  this  atmospheric  condition, 
warm  tropical  air  is  drawn  across  the  Alps  and  loses  moisture 
on  the  southern  slopes  of  the  mountains.  The  air  warms  signif- 
icantly as  it  compresses  during  its  descent  from  the  northern 
slopes.  In  the  springtime,  these  winds  dissipate  the  cloud  cover 
and  melt  the  snows.  Many  people  respond  to  the  rapid  weather 
changes  caused  by  the  John  with  headaches,  irritability,  and  cir- 
culatory problems. 

The  yearly  mean  temperature  for  the  country  is  about  9°  C. 
Other  than  for  variations  caused  by  shelter  and  elevation,  the 
annual  mean  temperature  is  fairly  constant  throughout  the 
country.  Temperature  extremes  between  night  and  day  and 
summer  and  winter  are  considerably  less  in  the  north  than  in 
the  south. 

Duringjanuary,  the  coldest  month,  the  average  temperature 
is  approximately  1.6°C  in  the  north  and  about  -2°C  in  the 
south.  In  July,  the  warmest  month,  the  situation  reverses,  and  it 
is  cooler  in  the  north  than  in  the  south.  The  northern  coastal 
region  has  July  temperatures  averaging  between  16°C  and 
18°C;  at  some  locations  in  the  south,  the  average  is  19.4°C  or 
slightly  higher.

Annual  precipitation  varies  from  2,000  millimeters  a  year  in 
the  southern  mountains  to  a  low  of  400  millimeters  in  the  vicin- 
ity of  Mainz.  Over  most  of  the  country,  it  averages  between  600 
millimeters  and  800  millimeters  per  annum. 

The  Environment 

Unification  abruptly  transformed  the  Federal  Republic 
from  a  country  with  a  solid,  even  excellent,  environmental 
record  to  one  facing  a  whole  range  of  ecological  disasters — the 
result  of  the  GDR's  decades-long  abuse  of  its  natural  habitat. 
The  estimated  costs  of  restoring  the  environment  in  the  new 
Lander  grew  as  information  became  available  about  how  much 
damage  it  had  sustained.  Expert  estimates  of  from  DM130  bil- 
lion to  DM220  billion  (for  value  of  the  deutsche  mark — see 
Glossary)  in  the  spring  of  1990  had  increased  to  a  possible 
DM400  billion  two  years  later. 

The  two  Germanys  differed  greatly  in  their  approaches 
toward  protecting  the  environment.  Beginning  in  the  late 
1960s,  ecological  concerns  had  become  increasingly  common 
in  West  Germany,  as  was  repeatedly  demonstrated  in  opinion 
polls.  A  1990  poll,  for  example,  found  that  more  than  70  per- 
cent of  those  West  Germans  questioned  held  that  environmen- 
tal protection  should  be  the  highest  priority  for  the 
government  and  the  economy. 

In  East  Germany,  environmental  activism  was  minimal.  For 
decades  the  GDR  had  followed  standard  Soviet  practices  in 
regard  to  industrial  and  urban  development,  scrimping  on  or 
avoiding  entirely  key  infrastructure  investments  such  as 
water-treatment  facilities  and  air-pollution  abatement.  The 
comprehensive  and  intelligent  Socialist  Environmental  Man- 
agement Act  of  1968  was  poorly  implemented  and,  more 
important,  largely  ignored  after  the  late  1970s  when  East  Ger- 
man authorities  decided  that  Western  economic  growth  could 
only  be  matched  by  sacrificing  the  environment.  This  policy 
was  followed  throughout  the  1980s. 

West  German  environmental  legislation  initially  lagged 
behind  that  of  East  Germany.  For  the  first  decades  after  World 
War  II,  West  Germans  were  concerned  with  reconstructing 
their  country  and  its  economy.  Early  efforts  to  deal  with  the 
environment  met  with  little  interest.  The  attainment  of  wide- 
spread prosperity  and  the  coming  to  maturity  of  a  new  genera- 
tion with  so-called  postmaterialist  values  led  to  an  interest  in 
protecting  the  environment.  The  late  1960s  and  the  early  1970s 


145 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

saw  the  passage  of  several  dozen  laws  relating  to  the  environ- 
ment, the  most  important  of  which  were  the  Waste  Disposal 
Law  and  the  Emission  Protection  Law,  both  passed  in  1972.  In 
1974  the  Federal  Environmental  Agency  was  established.  The 
new  legislation  established  the  principles  of  Germany's  envi- 
ronmental policies,  still  in  effect  in  the  mid-1990s:  preventing 
pollution  by  monitoring  new  products  and  projects;  requiring 
the  polluter,  rather  than  society  at  large,  to  pay  damages;  and 
relying  on  cooperation  among  government,  industry,  and  soci- 
ety to  protect  the  environment. 

The  oil  crisis  of  1973-74  and  the  ensuing  worldwide  reces- 
sion led  to  a  tapering  off  of  environmental  activism  on  the  part 
of  the  West  German  government  and  the  political  parties. 
However,  numerous  citizens'  groups  formed  and  pressed  for 
increased  environmental  protection  (see  Citizens'  Initiative 
Associations,  ch.  7).  The  accident  at  the  Three  Mile  Island 
nuclear  power  plant  in  the  United  States  in  1979  also  spurred 
the  growth  of  such  groups.  Elements  of  the  environmental 
movement  formed  a  political  party,  the  Greens  (Die  Grunen) 
in  1980,  which  in  1983  won  seats  in  the  Bundestag  (see  The 
Greens,  ch.  7).  Of  greatest  importance  were  domestic  ecologi- 
cal problems  such  as  pollution  in  the  Baltic  Sea  and  the  Rhine 
and  Main  rivers  and  damage  to  the  country's  forests  from  acid 
rain. 

During  the  early  1980s,  concerns  about  the  environment 
became  widespread  in  the  general  population,  and  all  political 
parties  were  forced  to  address  them.  These  concerns  were 
raised  still  higher  by  a  series  of  ecological  disasters  in  1986:  the 
accident  at  the  nuclear  plant  at  Chernobyl  in  the  Soviet  Union 
and  serious  spills  of  dangerous  chemicals  into  the  Rhine  at 
Basel  in  Switzerland.  Immediately  after  the  Chernobyl  disaster, 
Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl  created  the  Ministry  of  the  Environ- 
ment, Nature  Conservation,  and  Reactor  Safety. 

Stricter  environmental  controls  led  to  marked  improve- 
ments in  air  quality.  Between  1966  and  1988,  sulfur  dioxide 
emissions  in  West  Germany  fell  by  one-third.  Dust  levels,  which 
stood  at  3.2  million  tons  in  1980,  fell  to  550,000  tons  by  the  late 
1980s.  The  quality  of  river  water  also  improved.  The  Rhine  and 
Main  rivers,  nearly  "biologically  dead"  in  the  1960s,  supported 
several  species  of  fish  by  the  early  1990s.  The  Ruhr  River, 
located  in  the  heart  of  the  country's  largest  manufacturing 
region,  became  the  cleanest  "industrial"  river  in  West  Germany 


146

after  the  construction  of  a  series  of  dams  and  the  reforestation 
of  slag  heaps  and  wastelands. 

At  unification,  the  ecological  situation  in  the  new  Ldnderwas 
quite  different.  Because  95  percent  of  industrial  wastewater 
had  been  discharged  without  treatment  and  32  percent  of 
households  were  not  connected  to  sewerage  systems,  more 
than  40  percent  of  the  rivers  of  the  new  Lander  and  24  percent 
of  their  lakes  were  totally  unfit  as  sources  of  drinking  water; 
only  3  percent  of  their  rivers  and  1  percent  of  their  lakes  were 
considered  ecologically  healthy.  Some  rivers  had  pollution  lev- 
els 200  times  higher  than  that  permitted  by  European  Commu- 
nity (EC — see  Glossary)  environmental  standards.  The 
widespread  use  of  brown  coal  had  resulted  in  record  emissions 
of  sulfur  dioxide,  which  rose  by  one-fifth  between  1980  and 
1988.  Moreover,  decades  of  brown  coal  strip  mining  had  left 
some  eastern  areas  resembling  a  lunar  landscape.  Other  areas 
had  been  contaminated  by  the  mining  and  processing  of  ura- 
nium, primarily  to  service  the  Soviet  nuclear  sector. 

Although  East  German  per  capita  waste  production  had 
been  much  lower  than  that  of  West  Germany,  the  East  German 
government  had  negotiated  away  this  advantage  and  jeopar- 
dized ecological  security  in  the  bargain.  In  the  1980s,  the  GDR 
had  earned  hard  currency  by  importing  and  carelessly  dispos- 
ing of  millions  of  tons  of  West  Germany's  trash,  exacerbating 
soil  degradation  and  groundwater  contamination.  Some  60 
percent  of  industrial  waste  had  been  deposited  without  con- 
trols. Of  about  11,000  landfill  sites,  more  than  10,000  were 
uncontrolled.  With  more  than  28,000  potentially  hazardous 
sites,  the  cleanup  effort  required  in  the  east  appears  compara- 
ble in  scope  to  the  Superfund  campaign  in  the  United  States. 

The  Cold  War  had  also  damaged  East  Germany's  environ- 
ment and  to  a  lesser  extent  that  of  West  Germany.  For  nearly 
five  decades,  millions  of  troops  from  the  East  and  the  West  had 
made  intensive  use  of  the  territory  of  the  two  Germanys  as  mil- 
itary bases  and  training  sites.  Cleanup  costs  were  estimated  in 
the  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.  In  recognition  of  this  situa- 
tion, the  United  States  Department  of  Defense  allocated  funds 
to  repair  environmental  damage  in  the  Federal  Republic.  In 
contrast,  Soviet  and  later  Russian  forces,  although  they  report- 
edly occupied  as  much  as  2.5  percent  of  East  German  territory, 
were  paid  to  leave  the  country  and  did  so  without  compensat- 
ing Germany  for  the  extreme  environmental  damage  they  had 
caused.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

With  unification  in  1990,  the  new  Lander  became  subject  to 
the  environmental  laws  of  the  Federal  Republic  and  the  EC, 
although  both  sets  of  laws  were  to  be  applied  gradually.  Stan- 
dards in  some  areas,  such  as  emissions  control,  would  not  come 
into  effect  until  after  2000.  The  ecological  situation  in  the  new 
Lander  soon  changed  for  the  better,  although  much  of  the 
improvement  stemmed  less  from  the  imposition  of  new  stan- 
dards than  from  the  closing,  for  economic  reasons,  of  out- 
moded plants  that  had  caused  much  pollution.  Projects  such  as 
constructing  new  air,  water,  and  soil  treatment  plants  and  mod- 
ernizing old  ones,  reducing  the  amounts  of  brown  coal  con- 
sumed, and  cleaning  up  dump  sites  will  gradually  undo 
decades  of  ecological  damage.  Some  environmental  policies  in 
the  new  Lander,  like  those  in  the  old  Lander,  are  preventive  in 
nature.  Because  of  the  irresponsible  practices  of  the  former 
GDR,  however,  a  great  number  are  also  restorative. 

Serious  environmental  problems  continue  to  confront  Ger- 
many. Despite  the  efforts  begun  in  the  early  1970s,  the  "death 
of  the  forest"  (Waldsterben)  caused  by  acid  rain  continues.  In 
1992  about  68  percent  of  the  country's  trees  had  suffered  sig- 
nificant ecological  damage.  Forests  in  northwestern  Germany 
had  suffered  the  least  damage  from  acid  rain,  those  in  the 
south  and  east  the  most.  Chemical  emissions  from  automobiles 
are  a  serious  cause  of  this  problem.  Only  since  1993,  however, 
have  new  vehicles  been  required  to  have  catalytic  converters. 
Germany's  farmers  also  cause  much  pollution  through  inten- 
sive use  of  fertilizers.  Because  they  are  a  powerful  interest 
group,  it  has  been  difficult  to  pass  legislation  to  regulate  their 
farming  methods. 

Nuclear  power  presents  a  special  dilemma  for  Germany.  In 
western  Germany,  support  for  that  power  source,  which  in  the 
mid-1990s  supplied  about  35  percent  of  the  country's  energy 
requirement,  has  fluctuated  depending  upon  international 
events  and  crises.  As  of  the  mid-1990s,  however,  there  appeared 
little  chance  that  any  more  nuclear  plants  would  be  con- 
structed in  the  near  future. 

Upon  unification,  the  Federal  Republic  inherited  East  Ger- 
many's two  nuclear  power  plants,  which  had  been  built  to 
Soviet  specifications.  Decommissioning  these  plants  would 
increase  reliance  on  polluting  coal-fired  power  plants.  Despite 
this  prospect,  the  likelihood  of  a  Chernobyl-like  disaster 
prompted  the  shutdown  of  these  unsafe  nuclear  power  plants.

Population 

The  population  of  Germany  manifests  trends  characteristic 
of  most  advanced  industrial  countries:  lower  marriage  rates, 
delayed  marriage  and  child-bearing,  low  fertility  rates,  small 
household  size,  high  divorce  rates,  and  extended  life  expect- 
ancy. The  population  of  indigenous  Germans  has  been  in 
decline  since  1972  in  the  west  and  since  1969  in  the  east 
because  the  number  of  births  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  num- 
ber of  deaths.  In  1990  only  five  of  the  sixteen  Lander  registered 
growth  in  population  because  of  natural  increase. 

Household  size  decreased  from  3.0  persons  in  1950  to  2.3  in 
1990.  Marriage  rates  have  slackened,  while  divorce  rates  have 
risen  or  remained  stable  at  high  rates.  In  the  late  1980s,  almost 
one-third  of  all  marriages  ended  in  divorce.  Infant  mortality 
has  steadily  declined,  and  life  expectancy  has  risen,  albeit  more 
slowly  in  eastern  Germany.  As  in  the  United  States,  a  greater 
proportion  of  the  population  is  moving  into  advanced  age.  In 
1871  only  4.6  percent  of  the  population  was  sixty-five  years  of 
age  or  older.  By  1939  that  proportion  had  risen  to  7.8  percent, 
and  by  1992  it  had  risen  to  about  15  percent.  By  2000  it  is  esti- 
mated that  one-quarter  of  the  population  will  be  sixty  or  older. 

Since  the  1950s,  the  population  of  Germany  has  become 
more  diverse.  Millions  of  foreigners  have  migrated  to  Germany, 
seeking  employment,  citizenship,  or  asylum.  In  contrast  to  the 
native  population,  foreigners  in  Germany  tend  to  have  more 
children  and  larger  households.  In  1988  their  average  house- 
hold size  was  3.5  persons.  Depending  upon  their  origins  and 
social  status,  foreigners  in  Germany  have  been  integrated  into 
society  in  widely  varying  degrees. 

Historical  Background 

Since  the  first  unification  of  Germany  in  1871  to  form  the 
German  Empire,  the  population  and  territorial  expanse  of 
Germany  have  fluctuated  considerably,  chiefly  as  a  result  of 
gains  and  losses  in  war.  At  the  time  of  its  founding,  the  empire 
was  home  to  some  41  million  people,  most  of  whom  lived  in  vil- 
lages or  small  towns  (see  table  5,  Appendix).  As  industrializa- 
tion and  urbanization  accelerated  over  the  next  forty  years,  the 
population  increased  significantly  to  64.6  million,  according  to 


149 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  1910  census.  About  two-thirds  of  this  population  lived  in 
towns  with  more  than  2,000  inhabitants,  and  the  number  of 
large  cities  had  grown  from  eight  in  1871  to  eighty-four  in 
1910.  Stimulating  population  growth  were  improvements  in 
sanitary  and  working  conditions  and  in  medicine.  Another  sig- 
nificant source  of  growth  was  an  influx  of  immigrants  from 
Eastern  Europe,  who  came  to  Germany  to  work  on  farms  and 
in  mines  and  factories.  This  wave  of  immigrants,  the  first  of  sev- 
eral groups  that  would  swell  Germany's  population  in  the  suc- 
ceeding decades,  helped  compensate  for  the  millions  of 
Germans  who  left  their  country  in  search  of  a  better  life,  many 
of  whom  went  to  the  United  States. 

At  the  outbreak  of  World  War  I  in  1914,  the  population  of 
Germany  had  reached  about  68  million.  A  major  demographic 
catastrophe,  the  war  claimed  2.8  million  lives  and  caused  a 
steep  decline  in  the  birth  rate.  In  addition,  the  1919  Treaty  of 
Versailles  awarded  territories  containing  approximately  7  mil- 
lion German  inhabitants  to  the  victors  and  to  newly  indepen- 
dent or  reconstituted  countries  in  Eastern  Europe. 

In  the  1930s,  during  the  regime  of  Adolf  Hitler,  a  period  of 
expansion  added  both  territory  and  population  to  the  Third 
Reich.  Following  the  annexation  of  Austria  in  1938  and  the 
Sudetenland  (part  of  Czechoslovakia)  in  1939,  German  terri- 
tory and  population  encompassed  586,126  square  kilometers 
and  79.7  million  people,  according  to  the  1939  census.  The 
census  found  that  women  still  outnumbered  men  (40.4  million 
to  38.7  million),  despite  a  leveling  trend  in  the  interwar 
period. 

The  carnage  of  World  War  II  surpassed  that  of  World  War  I. 
German  war  losses  alone  were  estimated  at  7  million,  about 
half  of  whom  died  in  battle.  Ruined,  defeated,  and  divided  into 
zones  of  occupation,  a  much  smaller  Germany  emerged  in 
1945  with  a  population  about  the  same  as  in  1910.  In  the  imme- 
diate postwar  period,  however,  more  than  12  million  persons — 
expelled  Germans  and  displaced  persons — immigrated  to  Ger- 
many or  used  the  country  as  a  transit  point  en  route  to  other 
destinations,  adding  to  the  population. 

By  1950  the  newly  established  Federal  Republic  of  Germany 
had  a  population  of  about  50  million,  more  than  9  million  of 
whom  were  "expellees."  The  German  Democratic  Republic  had 
about  4  million  newcomers  and  14  million  natives  (see  table  6, 
Appendix).  Most  of  the  expellees  came  from  East  Prussia, 
Pomerania,  Silesia,  and  the  Sudetenland,  all  one-time  German 


150

territories  held  by  other  countries  at  the  end  of  World  War  II. 
The  majority  of  the  settlers  in  West  Germany  remained,  found 
work  in  the  rapidly  recovering  economy,  and  in  time  were  suc- 
cessfully integrated  into  the  society.  Between  1950  and  1989, 
West  Germany's  population  grew  from  50  million  to  62.1  mil- 
lion. Resettled  Germans  and  refugees  from  former  eastern  ter- 
ritories and  their  families  constituted  approximately  20 
percent  of  the  country's  population.  From  its  earliest  years, 
West  Germany  had  become  either  a  temporary  or  a  final  desti- 
nation for  millions  of  migrants.  Yet  despite  this  influx,  the 
country  did  not  develop  an  identity  as  a  country  of  immigra- 
tion as  did,  for  example,  the  United  States  or  Canada. 

The  situation  in  East  Germany  was  much  different.  From  its 
founding  in  1949,  the  GDR  struggled  to  stabilize  its  population 
and  thwart  emigration.  In  the  course  of  its  forty-year  history, 
almost  one-quarter  of  East  Germany's  population  fled  the  state 
to  settle  in  West  Germany.  In  the  1950s  alone,  more  than  2  mil- 
lion people  moved  west,  a  migration  that  triggered  the 
regime's  radical  solution  in  August  1961 — the  construction  of 
the  Berlin  Wall  (see  The  Berlin  Wall,  ch.  2).  During  most  of  its 
existence,  the  only  segment  of  East  Germany's  population  per- 
mitted to  leave  for  West  Germany  were  retirees,  whose  resettle- 
ment there  was  unofficially  encouraged  to  reduce  the  GDR's 
pension  payments.  As  a  result,  the  number  of  persons  sixty 
years  of  age  and  older  in  the  GDR  fell  from  22.1  percent  in 
1970  to  18.3  percent  in  1985  and  made  the  East  German  popu- 
lation younger  than  that  of  West  Germany. 

Deprived  of  a  regular  supply  of  workers  by  the  construction 
of  the  Berlin  Wall,  the  Federal  Republic  in  the  1960s  absorbed 
yet  another  wave  of  migrants.  Laborers  were  recruited  through 
agreements  with  seven  countries:  Italy,  Spain,  Greece,  Turkey, 
Portugal,  Tunisia,  and  Morocco.  Between  1955  and  1973,  the 
number  of  foreign  workers,  called  guest  workers  ( Gastarbeiter) 
to  emphasize  the  intended  temporary  nature  of  their  con- 
tracts, grew  from  about  100,000  to  about  2.5  million.  Originally 
brought  in  for  three-year  shifts,  most  workers — mainly  single 
men — remained  and  made  a  valuable  contribution  to  the 
booming  West  German  economy.  In  the  early  1970s,  however,  a 
recession  brought  on  by  the  international  energy  crisis  slowed 
the  West  German  economy;  the  importing  of  workers  officially 
came  to  an  end  in  1973  (see  Immigration,  this  ch.). 

In  the  1980s  and  early  1990s,  the  fourth  and  most  controver- 
sial wave  of  immigrants  to  West  Germany  were  asylum-seekers 


151 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

and  political  refugees — ethnic  Germans  from  Poland,  Yugosla- 
via, Czechoslovakia,  and  territories  belonging  to  the  former 
Soviet  Union  and  also  East  Germans  who  moved  west  as  the 
GDR  collapsed.  Many  Germans  were  angered  by  the  financial 
and  social  costs  these  immigrants  required  because  they 
believed  many  asylum-seekers  were  drawn  to  Germany  more  by 
the  desire  for  a  better  standard  of  living  than  by  the  need  to 
escape  political  oppression.  Many  ethnic  Germans  hardly 
seemed  German:  some  did  not  even  speak  German. 

Fertility 

Despite  the  Berlin  Wall  and  the  fortified  boundary  that 
divided  them,  the  two  Germanys  had  many  similar  demo- 
graphic developments  in  the  postwar  period.  In  the  late  1950s 
and  especially  in  the  1960s,  both  Germanys  experienced  a 
"baby  boom,"  stimulated  by  increased  economic  prosperity  and 
a  heightened  sense  of  security.  During  the  second  half  of  the 
1960s,  East  Germany's  population  grew  slightly,  an  unusual 
occurrence.  In  West  Germany,  the  absolute  peak  in  births,  1.3 
million,  was  reached  in  1965.  In  that  year,  births  outnumbered 
deaths  by  417,504. 

After  the  baby  boom,  both  countries  experienced  periods  of 
zero  population  growth  when  the  annual  number  of  births 
failed  to  compensate  for  the  annual  number  of  deaths.  As  of 
1993,  with  the  exclusion  of  foreigners'  births,  deaths  have  out- 
numbered births  every  year  since  1976  in  the  old  Lander.  Since 
1986  the  same  has  been  true  for  the  new  Lander.  When  the 
West  German  total  fertility  rate  reached  its  historic  peacetime 
low  of  fewer  than  1.3  children  per  woman  of  child-bearing  age 
in  1985,  popular  newsmagazines  caused  a  sensation  with  cover 
stories  that  warned  of  the  eventual  disappearance  of  the  Ger- 
mans. In  the  former  GDR,  a  pronatalist  policy  temporarily  had 
modest  success  in  boosting  the  birth  rate  in  the  mid-1970s,  but 
the  population  declined  there  for  two  reasons:  emigration  and 
low  fertility.  This  was  especially  noticeable  after  the  fall  of  the 
Berlin  Wall  in  November  1989  when  emigration  soared.  Low 
fertility  also  continued  to  be  a  problem.  Between  1989  and 
1991,  eastern  Germany's  total  fertility  rate  fell  by  38  percent.  In 
1991  the  rate  was  0.98,  well  below  West  Germany's  lowest  level. 

Although  its  population  was  just  one-fifth  that  of  West  Ger- 
many, until  1986  East  Germany  officially  topped  in  absolute 
terms  West  Germany  in  both  the  number  of  births  outside  mar- 
riage and  the  number  of  abortions.  This  situation  was 


152 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


accounted  for  in  part  by  a  chronic  lack  of  birth  control  choices 
in  the  former  Soviet  bloc  and  the  practice  of  using  abortion  as 
a  regular  means  of  curbing  unwanted  pregnancies.  In  1988 
one-third  of  all  births  in  the  GDR  were  to  unwed  mothers, 
whereas  in  the  FRG  only  one-tenth  were.  The  trend  of 
out-of-wedlock  births  in  the  east  continued  to  increase  after 
unification.  By  1992  nearly  42  percent  of  the  babies  born  in  the 
new  Lander  were  to  single  mothers,  compared  with  12  percent 
in  the  old  Lander. 

Until  mid-1993,  when  a  more  restrictive  West  German  law 
came  into  effect,  the  eastern  section  of  Germany  recognized 
the  right  of  abortion  on  demand.  The  highest  rate  was  reached 
in  1972,  when  one-third  of  pregnancies  were  aborted.  By  1989 
the  rate  had  declined,  but  the  probability  of  an  abortion  was 
still  one  in  every  four  pregnancies.  In  the  old  Lander,  legal 
abortions  were  restricted  to  special  circumstances  based  on 
such  factors  as  the  physical  or  mental  health  of  the  mother  or 
fetus.  In  1989  West  Germany  officially  registered  75,297  abor- 
tions, compared  with  about  74,000  for  East  Germany.  Social, 
cultural,  and  economic  factors  accounted  for  the  differences  in 
frequency  of  abortion  and  extramarital  birth  rates. 

Following  unification,  a  trend  termed  demographic  paralysis 
was  observed  in  the  former  East  Germany  when  the  number  of 
births  fell  by  50  percent  between  1990  and  1993.  From  1988  to 
mid-1993,  the  crude  birth  rate  fell  from  12.9  per  1,000  to  5.3 
per  1,000,  an  abrupt  and  precipitous  decline  unmatched  in  an 
industrial  society  in  peacetime.  Especially  hard  hit  by  skyrocket- 
ing unemployment  and  adrift  in  an  alien  market  economy, 
record  numbers  of  women  in  the  new  Lander  stopped  having 
children.  Some  reports  indicated  that  by  the  summer  of  1993 
as  many  as  two-thirds  of  working  women  in  the  east  had  lost 
their  jobs  since  unification.  In  that  same  year,  the  marriage  rate 
fell  by  half. 

Age-Gender  Distribution 

In  the  early  1990s,  an  age-gender  distribution  pyramid  of 
unified  Germany's  population  displayed  at  its  apex  the  legacy 
of  heavy  war  casualties:  a  preponderance  of  elderly  women  too 
great  to  be  explained  by  women's  greater  longevity.  Official  sta- 
tistics show  that  in  1990  there  were  approximately  2.7  million 
more  females  than  males  (41.2  million  versus  38.5  million)  in 
Germany.  In  the  same  year,  so  many  wives  had  outlived  their 
husbands,  either  because  of  war  deaths  or  because  of  the  lower 


153 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

life  expectancy  of  males,  that  the  4.9  million  elderly  widows  in 
the  country  accounted  for  approximately  6  percent  of  the  total 
population.  Population  specialists  have  forecast  the  transfor- 
mation of  the  pyramid  into  a  mushroom,  as  the  effect  of  slack- 
ening birth  rates  pushes  the  population  bulge  higher  up  the 
age  categories.  In  1990  about  50  percent  of  the  population  was 
under  thirty-seven  years  of  age  (see  fig.  8). 

The  progressive  aging  of  Germany's  population  has  been 
rapid.  In  1970  those  aged  seventeen  or  younger  made  up  27.2 
percent  of  the  population,  those  aged  eighteen  to  sixty-five 
accounted  for  59.1  percent,  and  those  aged  sixty-five  and  older 
were  13.7  percent.  By  1990  these  shares  had  changed  to  19.2 
percent,  65.8  percent,  and  15  percent,  respectively.  The  impli- 
cations of  this  trend  for  social  welfare  and  security  are  a  cause 
of  concern.  In  the  early  1990s,  one  pensioner  was  financed  by 
three  employees.  If  present  trends  continue,  forecasts  indicate 
that  by  2030  as  much  as  28  percent  of  Germany's  population 
will  be  elderly,  and  there  will  be  a  1:1  ratio  between  pensioners 
and  workers. 

Mortality 

In  the  postwar  period,  the  former  GDR  developed  a  compre- 
hensive health  care  system  that  made  steady  advances  in  reduc- 
ing infant  mortality  and  extending  life  expectancy  for  both 
men  and  women.  Early  in  the  postwar  period,  life  expectancy 
in  some  categories  was  actually  longer  for  East  Germans  than 
for  West  Germans,  and  infant  mortality  was  lower  until  1980. 
However,  starting  in  the  mid-1970s,  West  Germany  began  to 
register  longer  life  expectancies  in  every  age-group,  and  after 
1980  the  infant  mortality  rate  dropped  below  that  of  East  Ger- 
many. In  1988  infant  mortality  in  West  Germany  was  7.6  per 
1,000  live  births  and  8.1  per  1,000  in  East  Germany. 

The  better  health  and  longevity  of  West  Germans  probably 
stemmed  from  an  increased  interest  in  quality  of  life  issues, 
personal  health,  and  the  environment.  East  Germans,  in  con- 
trast, suffered  the  ill  effects  of  the  Soviet  model  of  a  traditional 
rust-belt  industrial  economy,  with  minimal  concern  for  work- 
ers' safety  and  health  and  wanton  disregard  of  the  need  to  pro- 
tect the  environment.  Improving  environmental  conditions 
and  a  more  health-conscious  way  of  living  should  gradually 
reduce  remaining  health  differences  among  Germans.  In  mid- 
1995  unified  Germany  had  an  estimated  mortality  rate  of  about 
eleven  per  1,000,  and  life  expectancy  was  estimated  at  76.6 


154 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


years  (73.5  years  for  males  and  79.9  years  for  females).  The 
major  causes  of  death  were  the  same  as  those  of  other 
advanced  countries  (see  Current  Health  Care  Issues  and  Out- 
look for  the  Future,  ch.  4). 

Population  Distribution  and  Urbanization 

Following  unification,  the  Federal  Republic  encompassed 
356,958  square  kilometers  and  was  one  of  the  largest  countries 
in  Europe.  With  about  81.3  million  people  in  mid-1995,  it 
ranked  second  behind  Russia  in  population  among  the  coun- 
tries of  Europe.  Unification  actually  reduced  the  Federal 
Republic's  population  density,  however,  because  East  Germany, 
which  had  a  large  rural  area,  was  more  sparsely  populated. 
With  an  average  of  228  persons  per  square  kilometer  in  late 
1993,  unified  Germany  ranked  third  in  population  density 
among  European  countries.  It  ranked  behind  the  Netherlands 
and  Belgium,  which  had  363  and  329  persons  per  square  kilo- 
meter, respectively. 

Germany's  population  density  varies  greatly.  The  most 
densely  populated  Lander  axe  Berlin,  Hamburg,  and  Bremen, 
with  densities  of  3,898,  2,236,  and  1,697  persons  per  square 
kilometer,  respectively,  at  the  end  of  1992  (see  table  7,  Appen- 
dix) .  The  least  densely  populated  are  two  new  Lander,  Mecklen- 
burg-Western Pomerania  and  Brandenburg,  both  mostly  rural 
in  character.  They  had  population  densities  of  eighty  and 
eighty-six  persons  per  square  kilometer,  respectively,  at  the  end 
of  1992.  Other  Lander  axe  closer  to  the  national  average:  the 
largest  Land,  Bavaria,  with  167  persons  per  square  kilometer,  is 
mostly  rural,  but  its  capital  is  the  large  city  of  Munich;  Rhine- 
land-Palatinate,  with  196  persons  per  square  kilometer,  is  also 
mostly  rural  but  has  numerous  heavily  populated  areas  along 
the  Rhine;  and  Saxony,  with  252  persons  per  square  kilometer, 
also  has  a  number  of  heavily  populated  areas. 

The  Land  with  the  most  population,  one-fifth  of  the  nation's 
total,  is  North  Rhine-Westphalia.  With  a  population  density  of 
519  persons  per  square  kilometer  at  the  end  of  1992,  it  is  the 
most  heavily  settled  of  all  Lander,  with  the  exception  of  the 
three  city  Lander  of  Bremen,  Hamburg,  and  Berlin.  North 
Rhine-Westphalia's  density  is  caused  by  its  many  cities;  several 
dozen  of  these  cities  have  populations  above  100,000,  includ- 
ing five  with  populations  above  500,000.  Many  of  these  cities 
are  located  so  close  together  that  they  form  one  of  Europe's

largest  urban  agglomerations,  the  Ruhrstadt  (Ruhr  City),  with 
a  population  of  about  5  million. 

The  Federal  Republic  has  few  very  large  cities  and  many 
medium-sized  ones,  a  reflection  of  the  centuries  when  the 
name  Germany  designated  a  geographical  area  consisting  of 
many  small  and  medium-sized  states,  each  with  its  own  capital 
(see  table  8,  Appendix).  Berlin,  by  far  the  largest  city,  with  a 
population  of  3.5  million  at  the  end  of  1993,  is  certain  to  grow 
in  population  as  more  of  the  government  moves  there  in  the 
second  half  of  the  1990s  and  as  businesses  relocate  their  head- 
quarters to  the  new  capital.  Some  estimates  predict  that 
Greater  Berlin  will  have  a  population  of  8  million  by  early  in 
the  twenty-first  century. 

Berlin  already  dwarfs  the  only  other  cities  having  more  than 
1  million  inhabitants:  Hamburg  with  1.7  million  and  Munich 
with  1.3  million.  Ten  cities  have  populations  between  500,000 
and  1  million,  seventeen  between  250,000  and  500,000,  and 


156 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


fifty-four  between  100,000  and  250,000.  In  the  early  1990s, 
about  one-third  of  the  population  lived  in  cities  with  100,000 
residents  or  more,  one-third  in  cities  and  towns  with  popula- 
tions between  50,000  and  100,000,  and  one-third  in  villages 
and  small  towns. 

Other  densely  populated  areas  are  located  in  the  southwest. 
They  are  Greater  Stuttgart;  the  Rhine-Main  area  with  its  center 
of  Frankfurt  am  Main;  and  the  Rhine-Neckar  region  with  its 
center  in  Mannheim.  The  greater  Nuremberg  and  Hanover 
regions  are  also  significant  population  centers.  The  new  Lander 
are  thinly  settled  except  for  Berlin  and  the  regions  of  Dresden- 
Leipzig  and  Chemnitz-Zwickau. 

Urban  areas  in  the  east  are  more  densely  populated  than 
those  in  the  west  because  the  GDR  saw  little  of  the  suburbaniza- 
tion seen  in  West  Germany.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  greater  con- 
trast between  urban  and  rural  areas  in  the  new  Lander  than  in 
the  west.  West  Germany's  suburbanization,  however,  is  not 
nearly  as  extensive  as  that  experienced  by  the  United  States 
after  the  end  of  World  War  II.  Compared  with  cities  in  the 
United  States,  German  cities  are  fairly  compact,  and  their 
inhabitants  can  quickly  reach  small  villages  and  farmlands. 

Germany's  population  growth  has  been  slow  since  the  late 
1960s.  Many  regions  have  shown  little  or  no  growth,  or  have 
even  declined  in  population.  The  greatest  growth  has  been  in 
the  south,  where  the  populations  of  Baden-Wurttemberg  and 
Bavaria  each  increased  by  well  over  1  million  between  1970  and 
1993.  (Each  had  also  grown  by  over  1  million  in  the  1960s.) 
North  Rhine-Westphalia,  which  had  grown  by  1  million  in  the 
1960s,  added  another  750,000  to  its  population  between  1970 
and  1993,  a  small  increase,  given  a  total  population  of  nearly  18 
million  at  the  end  of  1993.  Bremen,  Hamburg,  and  the  Saar- 
land experienced  some  population  loss  between  1970  and 
1993.  With  the  exception  of  united  Berlin,  all  the  new  Lander 
lost  population  between  the  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall  and  the  end 
of  1993.  In  general,  this  development  reflected  long-term 
trends  in  East  Germany,  although  the  rate  of  decline  has  been 
higher  since  unification. 

Immigration 

Immigration  has  been  a  primary  force  shaping  demographic 
developments  in  the  two  Germanys  in  the  postwar  period  (see 
Historical  Background,  this  ch.).  After  the  erection  of  the  Ber- 
lin Wall  in  1961,  the  immigration  flow,  first  into  West  Germany 


157 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

and  later  into  united  Germany,  consisted  mainly  of  workers 
from  southern  Europe.  In  addition,  the  immigrants  included 
several  other  groups:  a  small  but  steady  stream  of  East  German 
immigrants  (Ubersiedler)  during  the  1980s  that  exploded  in  size 
in  1990  (389,000)  but  by  1993  had  fallen  by  more  than  half 
(172,000)  and  was  somewhat  offset  by  movement  from  west  to 
east  (119,000);  several  million  ethnic  Germans  (Aussiedler) 
from  East  European  countries,  especially  the  former  Soviet 
Union;  and  several  million  persons  seeking  asylum  from  politi- 
cal oppression,  most  of  whom  were  from  East  European  coun- 
tries. 

Foreign  Residents 

As  of  early  1994,  approximately  6.8  million  registered  for- 
eigners resided  in  Germany.  Turks  made  up  the  largest  group 
(1.9  million),  followed  by  immigrants  from  the  former  Yugosla- 
via (930,000),  Italians  (565,000),  Greeks  (350,000),  Poles 
(260,000),  and  Austrians  (185,000).  About  25  percent  of  these 
foreign  residents,  most  of  whom  were  born  in  Germany,  are 
under  the  age  of  eighteen.  Because  of  the  higher  birth  rate  of 
foreigners,  one  of  every  ten  births  in  Germany  is  to  a  foreigner. 
However,  because  recruiting  of  Gastarbeiter  stopped  in  1973  at 
the  onset  of  a  worldwide  recession,  most  foreign  workers  are 
middle-aged  and  have  lived  in  Germany  for  several  decades. 

The  foreign  population  is  not  distributed  evenly.  More  than 
two-thirds  live  in  the  Lander  of  North  Rhine-Westphalia, 
Baden-Wurttemberg,  and  Bavaria,  where  in  1990  they  made  up 
9,  10,  and  7  percent  of  the  population,  respectively.  Foreigners 
live  mainly  in  urban  areas;  in  1989  approximately  23  percent  of 
foreign  residents  lived  in  Hamburg  and  Berlin.  Foreigners 
often  live  in  particular  areas  of  large  cities.  (For  example, 
Kreuzberg  in  Berlin  and  Kalk  in  Cologne  both  have  large  Turk- 
ish communities.)  There  are  few  foreigners  in  the  new  Lander. 
Of  the  roughly  190,000  foreigners  living  in  the  former  GDR  in 
1989  because  of  work  contracts,  many  have  since  been  repatri- 
ated to  Vietnam,  Mozambique,  Cuba,  and  other  developing 
countries  that  were  friendly  to  the  GDR  regime. 

Foreigners  began  arriving  in  West  Germany  in  large  num- 
bers in  the  1960s  after  the  construction  of  the  Berlin  Wall 
ended  migration  from  East  Germany.  Recruited  mainly  from  a 
number  of  countries  in  southern  Europe,  Gastarbeiter  were  not 
expected  to  stay  beyond  the  terms  of  their  work  permits.  How- 
ever, many  opted  to  remain  in  West  Germany  and  subsequently 


158

brought  their  families  there  to  live.  As  a  result,  and  owing  to 
higher  birth  rates,  the  foreign  population  in  Germany  has 
increased  substantially  (see  table  9,  Appendix).  By  offering 
financial  incentives,  West  German  authorities  hoped  to  encour- 
age some  Gastarbeiter  to  return  to  their  native  countries,  but  rel- 
atively few  took  advantage  of  these  provisions.  A  tightening  of 
entry  restrictions  also  caused  many  to  remain  in  Germany 
rather  than  risk  not  being  readmitted  after  spending  time  in 
their  home  country. 

Although  no  longer  recruited  abroad,  Germany's  foreign 
residents  remain  vital  to  the  economy,  parts  of  which  would 
shut  down  if  they  were  to  depart.  They  also  contribute  to  the 
country's  welfare  and  social  insurance  programs  by  paying 
twice  as  much  in  taxes  and  insurance  premiums  as  they  receive 
in  benefits.  In  the  long  term,  their  presence  may  be  seen  as 
vital  because  they  have  a  positive  birth  rate.  The  birth  rate 


159 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

among  native  Germans  is  so  low  that  some  studies  have  esti- 
mated that  Germany  will  require  approximately  200,000  immi- 
grants a  year  to  maintain  its  population  into  the  next  century 
and  support  its  array  of  social  welfare  benefits. 

Most  Germans  do  not  see  their  country  as  a  land  of  immigra- 
tion like  the  United  States  or  Canada,  and  no  demographic  or 
social  issue  has  generated  greater  controversy  than  the  pres- 
ence of  foreigners  in  the  Federal  Republic.  In  an  opinion  poll 
taken  in  1982,  two-thirds  of  West  Germans  said  that  there  were 
too  many  foreigners  in  Germany,  and  one-half  thought  that 
foreigners  should  be  sent  back  to  their  countries  of  origin.  In 
1992  another  poll  found  that  the  "foreigner  problem"  ranked 
as  the  most  serious  issue  for  western  Germans  and  was  third  in 
importance  for  eastern  Germans. 

According  to  the  foreigners  law  that  went  into  effect  in  mid- 
1993,  foreigners  living  in  Germany  for  fifteen  years  may 
become  German  citizens  if  they  have  no  criminal  record  and 
renounce  their  original  citizenship.  Young  foreigners  who  have 
resided  eight  years  in  Germany  may  become  citizens  if  they 
have  attended  German  schools  for  six  years  and  apply  for  citi- 
zenship between  the  ages  of  sixteen  and  twenty-three.  Usually, 
however,  German  citizenship  depends  not  on  where  one  is 
born  (ius  solis)  but  on  the  nationality  of  the  father  or,  since 
1974,  on  the  mother  (ius  sanguinis).  Thus,  to  many,  German 
citizenship  depends  on  being  born  German  and  cannot  right- 
fully be  acquired  through  a  legal  process.  This  notion  makes  it 
practically  impossible  for  naturalized  citizens  or  their  children 
to  be  considered  German.  Some  reformers  advocate  eliminat- 
ing the  concept  of  German  blood  in  the  1913  law  regulating 
citizenship,  but  the  issue  is  an  emotional  one,  and  such  a 
change  has  little  popular  support. 

Ethnic  Germans 

Ethnic  Germans  have  immigrated  to  Germany  since  the  end 
of  World  War  II.  At  first,  these  immigrants  were  Germans  who 
had  resided  in  areas  that  had  formerly  been  German  territory. 
Later,  the  offspring  of  German  settlers  who  in  previous  centu- 
ries had  settled  in  areas  of  Eastern  Europe  and  Russia  came  to 
be  regarded  as  ethnic  Germans  and  as  such  had  the  right  to 
German  citizenship  according  to  Article  116  of  the  Basic  Law. 
Because  they  became  citizens  immediately  upon  arrival  in  Ger- 
many, ethnic  Germans  received  much  financial  and  social  assis- 
tance to  ease  their  integration  into  society.  Housing,  vocational 


160 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


training,  and  many  other  types  of  assistance,  even  language 
training — because  many  did  not  know  the  language  of  their 
forebears — were  liberally  provided. 

With  the  gradual  opening  of  the  Soviet  empire  in  the  1980s, 
the  numbers  of  ethnic  Germans  coming  to  West  Germany 
swelled.  In  the  mid-1980s,  about  40,000  came  each  year.  In 
1987  the  number  doubled  and  in  1988  doubled  again.  In  1990 
nearly  400,000  ethnic  Germans  came  to  the  Federal  Republic. 
In  the  1991-93  period,  about  400,000  ethnic  Germans  settled 
in  Germany.  Since  January  1993,  immigration  of  ethnic  Ger- 
mans has  been  limited  to  220,000  per  year. 

Because  this  influx  could  no  longer  be  managed,  especially 
because  of  the  vast  expense  of  unification,  restrictions  on  the 
right  of  ethnic  Germans  to  return  to  Germany  became  effec- 
tive in  January  1991.  Under  the  new  restrictions,  once  in  Ger- 
many ethnic  Germans  are  assigned  to  certain  areas.  If  they 
leave  these  areas,  they  lose  many  of  their  benefits  and  are 
treated  as  if  they  were  foreigners.  The  government  has  also 
established  programs  to  encourage  the  estimated  several  mil- 
lion ethnic  Germans  who  still  live  in  the  former  Soviet  Union 
and  Eastern  Europe  to  remain  there.  Although  ethnic  Ger- 
mans are  entitled  to  German  citizenship  by  virtue  of  their 
bloodlines,  to  many  Germans  they  do  not  seem  German,  and 
their  social  integration  has  frequently  been  difficult. 

Asylum-Seekers 

To  atone  for  the  crimes  of  the  Third  Reich,  Article  16/2  of 
West  Germany's  Basic  Law  offers  liberal  asylum  rights  to  those 
suffering  political  persecution.  Until  the  1980s,  relatively  few 
refugees  took  advantage  of  this  provision.  But  in  the  second 
half  of  the  decade,  a  new  class  of  "jet-age  refugees"  began  to 
make  its  way  to  Europe  and  especially  to  West  Germany,  which 
accepted  more  than  any  other  West  European  country.  In  the 
mid-1980s,  many  refugees  came  from  Iran  and  Lebanon.  By 
1991  most  refugees  originated  in  regions  of  war-torn  former 
Yugoslavia,  Romania,  or  Turkey.  From  1986  to  1989,  about 
380,000  refugees  sought  asylum  inWest  Germany.  By  compari- 
son, in  the  1990-92  period,  nearly  900,000  people  sought  ref- 
uge in  a  united  Germany. 

Although  only  about  5  percent  of  requests  for  asylum  are 
approved,  slow  processing  and  appeals  mean  that  many  refu- 
gees remain  in  Germany  for  years.  Because  financial  aid  is  also 
provided  for  the  refugees'  living  expenses,  their  presence  has 


161 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

become  a  burden  on  federal  and  local  government.  The  result- 
ing social  tensions  made  imperative  an  amendment  to  the  con- 
stitutional provision  regarding  asylum.  After  heated  debate,  in 
1993  the  Bundestag  passed  legislation  that  amended  the  Basic 
Law  and  tightened  restrictions  on  granting  asylum.  One  impor- 
tant change  is  that  asylum-seekers  are  no  longer  to  be  admitted 
into  Germany  if  they  have  applied  from  a  third  country.  In 
addition,  more  funds  are  to  be  allotted  to  processing  applica- 
tions, so  that  asylum-seekers  remain  in  Germany  for  shorter 
periods. 

Ethnic  Minorities 

In  the  early  1990s,  there  were  between  50,000  and  60,000 
Gypsies  in  Germany.  They  were  divided  into  two  groups:  the 
Sinti,  who  have  lived  for  hundreds  of  years  in  Germany  and 
who  have  largely  adopted  conventional  modes  of  living  and 
employment;  and  the  Roma,  many  of  whom  fled  Romania  fol- 
lowing the  1989  revolution  that  toppled  the  Nicolae  Ceausescu 
regime.  The  lifestyle  and  work  habits  of  the  mobile  Roma  clash 
with  those  of  most  Germans.  As  a  result,  in  1992  the  German 
government  signed  an  agreement  with  Romania  providing  for 
the  repatriation  of  thousands  of  Roma  in  exchange  for  cash 
payments  to  be  used  for  housing  and  job  training. 

Several  other  minority  groups,  officially  recognized  and 
their  languages  protected,  also  live  in  Germany.  For  more  than 
1,000  years,  the  Sorbs,  a  Slavic  nationality,  have  lived  as  an  eth- 
nic minority  in  Brandenburg  and  Saxony.  As  of  1993,  there 
were  about  120,000  Sorbs  in  Germany.  In  addition,  about 
60,000  Danish  speakers  live  in  Schleswig-Holstein,  a  reminder 
of  the  area's  Danish  past;  and  about  12,000  speakers  of  the  Fri- 
sian language  live  on  the  Frisian  Islands  and  on  the  northwest- 
ern coast. 

Germany  once  had  a  prosperous  and  largely  assimilated  Jew- 
ish population  of  about  600,000.  In  the  1930s  and  1940s,  most 
German  Jews  were  exiled,  were  imprisoned,  or  perished  in 
Nazi  death  camps  (see  Total  Mobilization,  Resistance,  and  the 
Holocaust,  ch.  1).  By  the  early  1990s,  Germany's  Jewish  com- 
munity was  only  about  40,000.  Its  numbers  were  growing,  how- 
ever, as  the  result  of  the  immigration  of  some  Israelis  and 
Russian  Jews.  One  of  the  most  eloquent  spokespersons  for  the 
rights  of  minorities  and  a  tireless  advocate  for  greater  tolerance 
is  the  community's  leader,  Ignaz  Bubnis.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 


Women  in  Society 

For  centuries,  a  woman's  role  in  German  society  was 
summed  up  and  circumscribed  by  the  three  "K"  words:  Kinder 
(children),  Kirche  (church),  and  Kuche  (kitchen).  Throughout 
the  twentieth  century,  however,  women  have  gradually  won  vic- 
tories in  their  quest  for  equal  rights.  In  1919  they  received  the 
right  to  vote.  Profound  changes  also  were  wrought  by  World 
War  II.  During  the  war,  women  assumed  positions  traditionally 
held  by  men.  After  the  war,  the  so-called  Trummerfrauen 
(women  of  the  rubble)  tended  the  wounded,  buried  the  dead, 
salvaged  belongings,  and  began  the  arduous  task  of  rebuilding 
war-torn  Germany  by  simply  clearing  away  the  rubble. 

In  West  Germany,  the  Basic  Law  of  1949  declared  that  men 
and  women  were  equal,  but  it  was  not  until  1957  that  the  civil 
code  was  amended  to  conform  with  this  statement.  Even  in  the 
early  1950s,  women  could  be  dismissed  from  the  civil  service 
when  they  married.  After  World  War  II,  despite  the  severe 
shortage  of  young  men  that  made  marriage  impossible  for 
many  women,  traditional  marriage  once  again  became  society's 
ideal.  Employment  and  social  welfare  programs  remained 
predicated  on  the  male  breadwinner  model.  West  Germany 
turned  to  millions  of  migrants  or  immigrants — including  large 
numbers  of  GDR  refugees — to  satisfy  its  booming  economy's 
labor  requirements.  Women  became  homemakers  and  moth- 
ers again  and  largely  withdrew  from  employment  outside  the 
home. 

In  the  east,  however,  women  remained  in  the  workforce.  The 
Soviet-style  system  mandated  women's  participation  in  the 
economy,  and  the  government  implemented  this  key  objective 
by  opening  up  educational  and  vocational  opportunities  to 
women.  As  early  as  1950,  marriage  and  family  laws  also  had 
been  rewritten  to  accommodate  working  mothers.  Abortion 
was  legalized  and  funded  by  the  state  in  the  first  trimester  of 
pregnancy.  An  extensive  system  of  social  supports,  such  as  a 
highly  developed  day-care  network  for  children,  was  also  put  in 
place  to  permit  women  to  be  both  mothers  and  workers.  Eman- 
cipated "from  above"  for  economic  and  ideological  reasons, 
women  in  the  east  entered  institutes  of  higher  learning  and  the 
labor  force  in  record  numbers  while  still  maintaining  the 
household.  East  Germany  had  to  rely  on  women  because  of  its 
declining  population;  the  situation  was  made  more  critical  by 
the  fact  that  most  of  those  fleeing  to  West  Germany  were  men. 


164 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Because  of  these  developments,  about  90  percent  of  East 
German  women  worked  outside  the  home.  They  made  up 
about  half  the  membership  in  the  two  most  important  mass 
organizations  of  the  former  GDR — the  Free  German  Trade 
Union  Federation  (Freier  Deutscher  Gewerkschaftsbund — 
FDGB)  and  the  Free  German  Youth  (Freie  Deutsche  Jugend — 
FDJ).  In  1988  slightly  more  than  one-third  of  the  membership 
of  the  ruling  Socialist  Unity  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialistische 
Einheitspartei  Deutschlands — SED)  consisted  of  women.  In 
contrast,  only  about  4.4  percent  of  West  German  women  were 
members  of  a  political  party. 

After  several  decades  of  conforming  to  traditional  social  pat- 
terns, West  German  women  began  to  demand  changes.  Follow- 
ing patterns  in  Europe  and  the  United  States,  emancipation  in 
the  Federal  Republic  originated  "from  below,"  with  women 
themselves.  In  the  1970s,  the  women's  movement  gathered 
momentum,  having  emerged  as  an  outgrowth  of  student  pro- 
tests in  the  late  1960s  (see  Citizens'  Initiative  Associations,  ch. 
7).  Rallying  around  the  causes  of  equal  rights  (including  the 
right  to  abortion,  which  was  somewhat  restricted  in  West  Ger- 
many), the  movement  succeeded  in  having  legislation  passed 
in  1977  that  granted  a  woman  equal  rights  in  marriage.  A 
woman  could  work  outside  the  home  and  file  for  divorce  with- 
out her  husband's  permission.  Divorce  was  permitted  when  the 
marriage  partners  could  no  longer  be  reconciled. 

Women  also  made  gains  in  education  in  both  Germanys.  By 
the  mid-1960s,  East  German  women  accounted  for  about  half 
of  all  secondary  school  graduates  who  had  prepared  to  study  at 
institutes  of  higher  learning  in  the  GDR;  by  the  1975-76  aca- 
demic year,  they  were  in  the  majority  (53  percent).  To  assist 
women  in  completing  their  studies,  an  extensive  support  sys- 
tem, including  supplementary  payments  and  child  care,  was 
provided.  Expanded  educational  opportunities  for  West  Ger- 
man women  were  slower  in  coming  and  never  equaled  the  lev- 
els reached  in  the  east.  Only  in  the  early  1980s  did  West 
German  women  qualify  for  admission  to  universities  in  the 
same  numbers  as  men.  Although  fewer  than  that  number  pur- 
sued college  and  university  studies,  between  1970  and  1989  the 
percentage  of  female  students  increased  from  31  percent  to  41 
percent.  Two  factors  were  believed  to  be  responsible  for  the 
discrepancy  between  eastern  and  western  rates  of  attendance 
at  institutes  of  higher  learning:  West  German  women  had  a 
stronger  orientation  toward  traditional  familial  relations;  and 


165 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

they  had  dimmer  prospects  for  admission  to  particular  aca- 
demic departments  and  for  professional  employment  after 
graduation. 

Despite  significant  gains,  discrimination  remains  in  united 
Germany.  Income  inequalities  persist:  a  woman's  wages  and  sal- 
aries range  between  65  percent  and  78  percent  of  a  man's  for 
many  positions.  In  most  fields,  women  do  not  hold  key  posi- 
tions. Generally,  the  higher  the  position,  the  more  powerful  is 
male  dominance.  For  example,  women  are  heavily  represented 
in  the  traditional  care-giving  fields  of  health  and  education, 
but  even  in  such  fields  there  is  a  wide  disparity  between  the 
number  of  females  working  in  hospitals  (75  percent  of  total 
staff)  and  schools  (more  than  50  percent)  and  the  number  of 
female  physicians  (4  percent)  and  principals  (20  percent  in  the 
west  and  32  percent  in  the  east).  In  the  late  1980s,  only  5  per- 
cent of  university  professors  in  West  Germany  were  women. 

Although  substantial  barriers  to  equality  of  the  sexes  in  Ger- 
many remain  as  a  result  of  a  persistently  patriarchal  family 
structure  and  work  environment,  women  have  managed  to 
gain  isolated  high-profile  victories.  A  separate  national  office 
for  women's  affairs  was  created  in  West  Germany  in  1980,  and 
similar  agencies  have  been  established  in  most  Lander  in  united 
Germany.  Since  the  mid-1980s,  offices  responsible  for  working 
toward  women's  equality  have  been  active,  first  in  West  Ger- 
many and  after  unification  in  the  new  Lander.  The  Equality 
Offices  ( Gleichstellungstellen)  have  as  one  of  their  tasks  ensuring 
that  women  occupy  a  more  equitable  share  of  positions  in  the 
public  sector. 

Some  women  have  succeeded  in  reaching  positions  of 
power.  One  of  the  most  successful  women  in  politics  in  the 
1990s  is  Rita  Sussmuth,  president  of  the  Bundestag.  In  the  field 
of  industry,  Birgit  Breuel  assumed  the  leadership,  following  the 
assassination  of  Detlev  Rohwedder  in  April  1991,  of  the  Treu- 
handanstalt  (Trust  Agency),  the  powerful  agency  charged  with 
privatizing  the  former  East  German  economy.  Other  influen- 
tial and  prominent  German  women  in  the  mid-1990s  are  Mar- 
ion von  Donhoff,  coeditor  of  Die  Zeit,  and  Elizabeth 
Noelle-Neumann,  director  of  the  Allensbach  Public  Opinion 
Institute.  Yet  despite  this  progress,  a  1991  article  in  an  influen- 
tial weekly  magazine  made  it  clear  how  far  women  must  go  to 
achieve  equality.  The  magazine's  list  of  the  100  most  powerful 
people  in  Germany  included  only  four  women.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Almost  all  segments  of  eastern  German  society  encountered 
tremendous  difficulty  in  the  unification  process,  but  women 
suffered  the  most.  Some  reports  indicated  that  two-thirds  of 
working  women  in  the  new  Lander  were  unemployed,  and 
many  more  were  turned  into  part-time  workers  as  a  result  of 
privatization,  downsizing  of  firms,  and  elimination  of  support 
services  such  as  day-care  and  after-school  centers.  To  improve 
their  prospects  for  employment,  some  women  in  eastern  Ger- 
many reportedly  were  resorting  to  sterilization,  one  of  the  fac- 
tors contributing  to  the  steep  decline  in  births  from  twelve  per 
1,000  in  1989  to  5.3  per  1,000  in  1993. 

Among  the  issues  that  demonstrated  differences  between 
women  of  the  old  and  new  Lander,  one  of  the  most  contentious 
was  abortion.  In  1991  there  were  about  125,000  registered 
abortions  performed  in  Germany,  about  50,000  of  which  were 
in  the  east.  Although  the  number  of  registered  abortions  in 
both  parts  of  Germany  had  been  declining  in  recent  years,  the 
actual  number  of  abortions  was  estimated  at  about  250,000.  For 
a  time  following  unification,  the  restrictive  western  and  permis- 
sive eastern  legislation  on  abortion  continued  in  force.  In  June 
1992,  however,  the  Bundestag  voted  to  ease  abortion  restric- 
tions and  to  permit  the  procedure  during  the  first  twelve  weeks 
of  pregnancy  with  compulsory  counseling.  Resorting  to  what 
had  been  a  successful  policy  in  the  early  1970s,  those  opposed 
to  the  new  law,  including  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl,  appealed  to 
the  Federal  Constitutional  Court  in  Karlsruhe  to  nullify  the 
new  law.  Just  before  it  was  scheduled  to  take  effect,  the  law  was 
blocked  when  the  court  issued  an  injunction.  Subsequently,  a 
new  restrictive  law  came  to  apply  in  all  of  Germany  (see  Politi- 
cal Developments  since  Unification,  ch.  7). 

Marriage  and  Family 

Like  most  other  advanced  countries  in  the  postwar  era,  Ger- 
many recorded  fewer  marriages,  more  divorces,  and  smaller 
families.  In  1960  there  were  690,000  marriages,  compared  with 
516,000  in  1990.  The  total  for  1993  amounted  to  only  442,000, 
but  most  of  this  decline  was  caused  by  a  drop  of  than  more  50 
percent  in  the  number  of  marriages  in  the  new  Lander  between 
1990  and  1993.  Until  1990  the  decline  in  marriages  in  East  Ger- 
many had  been  appreciably  greater  than  in  West  Germany 
(from  215,000  in  1950  to  137,000  in  1989,  compared  with 
536,000  and  399,000  in  the  same  years  in  West  Germany),  but 
not  nearly  as  steep  in  the  1990-93  period.  Just  as  the  dramatic 


167 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

social  changes  brought  to  the  new  Lander  by  unification 
affected  birth  rates  there,  so  they  also  affected  marriages  rates. 

Another  difference  in  marriage  practices  between  the  two 
Germanys  had  been  that  easterners  marrying  for  the  first  time 
did  so  at  an  earlier  age  than  westerners.  Easterners  did  so,  it  is 
believed,  because  of  their  desire  to  have  children  and  hence 
qualify  for  low-cost  child  care  and  housing  benefits.  Following 
unification  this  difference  remained.  In  1992  the  average  age 
at  first  marriage  was  29.0  for  men  and  26.5  for  women  in  the 
old  Lander,  compared  with  2V.  1  for  men  and  25.1  for  women  in 
the  new  Lander.  Since  the  mid-1970s,  the  average  age  at  which 
people  marry  has  slowly  risen  for  both  genders  in  both  parts  of 
Germany. 

As  the  number  of  marriages  declined,  the  frequency  of 
divorce  increased  in  both  states.  Between  1960  and  1990,  the 
number  of  divorces  in  West  Germany  more  than  doubled, 
increasing  from  49,000  to  123,000  and  yielding  a  divorce  rate 
of  about  30  percent.  Divorce  was  always  more  common  in  East 
Germany  than  it  was  in  West  Germany.  The  number  of  divorces 
roughly  doubled  between  1960  and  1988,  going  from  25,000  to 
49,000.  In  1986  there  was  a  record  divorce  rate  of  46  percent. 
Although  home  to  only  20  percent  of  the  total  population,  the 
new  Lander  accounted  for  29  percent  of  all  divorces  in  1990. 
After  unification,  however,  the  incidence  of  divorce  decreased 
greatly  in  the  east,  perhaps  in  response  to  the  overall  uncer- 
tainty and  insecurity  of  future  prospects  for  single  mothers  in 
unified  Germany.  In  1992  the  number  of  divorces  in  the  new 
Lander  amounted  to  only  10,000.  In  1993,  however,  this  num- 
ber rose  to  18,000,  an  increase  of  78  percent. 

Despite  the  increasing  likelihood  of  divorce,  in  1990  about 
89  percent  of  all  families  consisted  of  married  couples,  and 
about  70  percent  of  those  of  marriage  age  were  married.  In 
both  east  and  west,  however,  the  failure  of  these  families  to  pro- 
duce the  necessary  number  of  children  for  population  replace- 
ment was  striking.  Of  the  15  million  married  couples  in  the 
former  West  Germany,  about  57  percent  had  children.  Forty- 
seven  percent  of  couples  with  children  had  one  child,  38  per- 
cent had  two  children,  and  13  percent  had  three  or  more  chil- 
dren. In  1950  the  average  number  of  persons  in  German 
households  was  3.0.  By  1990  this  figure  had  declined  to  2.3.  In 
1991  four-person  households  accounted  for  13  percent  of  the 
total  number  of  households,  three-person  households  for  16 
percent,  two-person  households  for  31  percent,  and 


168 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


single-person  households  for  35  percent.  In  the  early  1990s, 
only  foreign  families  were  regularly  having  two  or  more  chil- 
dren, with  the  Turkish  subgroup  being  the  largest  in  terms  of 
family  size. 

Like  West  Germany,  East  Germany  had  provided  legislative 
protection  for  the  family  and  married  couples,  together  with 
generous  maternity  leave  and  pay  provisions.  In  the  east,  how- 
ever, it  was  assumed  that  the  mother  would  rejoin  the  work- 
force soon  after  maternity  leave,  and  an  elaborate  child-care 
system  was  put  in  place.  Virtually  all  women  could  obtain  excel- 
lent care  for  their  children  if  they  wished.  In  the  west,  many 
mothers  gave  up  their  careers  or  interrupted  them  for  long 
periods  following  the  birth  of  a  child  because  child  care  was 
generally  unavailable.  As  a  result,  in  1990  women  of 
child-bearing  age  in  the  east  had  more  children  (1.67)  than 
women  in  the  west  (1.42).  Supported  by  the  state,  eastern 
women  had  long  been  accustomed  to  balancing  child-rearing 
and  a  profession.  After  unification,  however,  the  new  Lander 
experienced  a  precipitous  decline  in  births  because  of  high 
unemployment,  especially  among  women  (see  Fertility,  this 
ch.). 

By  the  mid-1990s,  the  newest  trend  in  household  formation 
was  what  became  known  as  nonmarital  living  partnerships. 
Between  1972  and  1990,  the  number  of  such  households 
increased  sevenfold,  to  963,000,  or  2-7  percent  of  all  house- 
holds. Almost  90  percent  of  these  were  childless  households. 
Most  young  people  were  opting  to  live  together  before  decid- 
ing to  marry.  This  factor  pushed  the  average  age  at  marriage 
higher. 

Another  sign  of  the  movement  away  from  the  traditional 
concept  of  family  and  of  the  manifestation  of  sexual  freedom 
was  the  rising  number  of  out-of-wedlock  births.  In  the  late 
1980s,  about  one  in  ten  West  German  and  three  in  ten  East 
German  births  were  to  unmarried  women. 

In  the  postwar  period,  it  became  clear  that  marriage  had  lost 
its  former  position  as  the  only  legitimate  locus  for  sexual  activ- 
ity. In  the  early  1990s,  polls  indicated  that  60  percent  of  Ger- 
man sixteen-year-olds  were  sexually  active,  compared  with  15 
percent  in  the  1950s. 

In  the  past,  when  regional  differences  were  acute,  conven- 
tion held  that  marriages  between  a  Prussian  and  a  Bavarian, 
between  a  Catholic  and  a  Protestant,  and  definitely  between  a 
Christian  and  a  Jew  were  "mixed"  marriages.  In  modern  Ger- 


169 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

many,  only  unions  between  Germans  and  foreigners  are  con- 
sidered mixed.  Of  516,000  marriages  in  1990,  about  6  percent 
were  between  Germans  and  foreigners.  Most  often  German 
women  married  Americans,  Italians,  Turks,  and  Yugoslavs,  and 
German  men  married  Yugoslavs,  Poles,  Filipinos,  and  Austri- 
ans.  In  1974  legislation  was  passed  conferring  automatic  citi- 
zenship on  children  born  of  these  unions. 

Housing 

There  is  a  wide  range  of  housing  stock  in  Germany,  from 
mansions  and  country  estates  for  the  wealthy,  to  tents  and  wel- 
fare hotels  for  the  needy  and  homeless.  Most  Germans  live  in 
self-contained  apartments  or  in  single-family  houses. 
Single-story  and  two-story  townhouse-like  dwellings  character- 
ize the  tidy  neighborhoods  of  small  towns  and  medium-sized 
cities,  and  high-rise  apartment  buildings  are  common  in  larger 
cities.  In  many  communities,  merchants,  tradespeople,  and 
shopkeepers  continue  to  live  above  their  stores,  and  clustered 
farmhouses  still  form  the  nucleus  of  many  villages. 

After  World  War  II,  West  Germany  faced  a  severe  housing 
shortage.  Not  only  had  the  war  destroyed  much  of  the  housing, 
but  the  millions  of  refugees  from  the  east  had  to  find  new 
accommodations.  According  to  one  estimate,  there  were  10 
million  dwellings  for  17  million  households.  The  housing 
shortage  often  forced  several  families  to  share  a  single  dwell- 
ing. In  the  1950s  and  1960s,  a  tremendous  surge  in  construc- 
tion, supported  heavily  by  the  government,  resulted  in  the 
construction  of  as  many  as  700,000  dwellings  in  a  single  year. 
Gradually,  the  housing  crisis  eased.  The  problems  that  per- 
sisted generally  involved  a  shortage  of  affordable  housing  in 
urban  areas.  Housing  conditions  in  East  Germany  also 
improved  greatly.  However,  much  of  the  housing  was  badly 
designed  and  poorly  constructed,  and  even  at  the  state's 
demise  in  1990,  the  overall  housing  supply  was  inadequate. 

Unification  revealed  significant  differences  in  the  quality, 
variety,  and  size  of  dwellings  in  the  two  Germanys.  In  West  Ger- 
many, about  70  percent  of  the  housing  stock  had  been  built 
after  1948,  with  95  percent  of  the  dwellings  having  their  own 
bathrooms  and  75  percent  having  central  heating.  In  East  Ger- 
many, 55  percent  of  the  housing  stock  had  been  built  before 
1948,  with  only  75  percent  of  the  dwellings  having  bathrooms 
and  only  47  percent  having  central  heating.  In  addition,  much 
of  the  housing  in  East  Germany  was  in  poor  condition  because 


170 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  authorities  had  maintained  rents  at  such  low  levels  that 
funds  were  not  available  for  essential  repairs. 

In  1992  united  Germany  had  approximately  34.5  million 
dwellings  with  149  million  rooms,  for  a  total  of  2.8  billion 
square  meters  of  living  space.  Dwellings  in  the  west  were  larger 
than  those  in  the  east.  In  1992  dwellings  in  the  old  Lander  had 
an  average  floor  space  of  82. 7  square  meters  for  an  average  of 
35.1  square  meters  per  person,  compared  with  64.5  square 
meters  and  an  average  of  29.0  square  meters  per  person  in  the 
new  Lander. 

The  federal  government  has  responded  with  special  mea- 
sures to  rectify  housing  problems  in  the  new  Lander,  launching 
an  ambitious  program  to  upgrade  and  expand  housing.  By 
1993  about  1.1  million  units  had  been  modernized.  Specialists 
have  estimated  that  bringing  housing  in  the  east  up  to  western 
standards  will  require  the  construction  of  140,000  new  dwell- 
ings a  year  until  2005. 

Unification  also  revealed  significant  differences  with  respect 
to  home  ownership.  In  the  early  1990s,  approximately  40  per- 
cent of  residents  owned  their  dwellings  in  the  old  Lander,  com- 
pared with  25  percent  in  the  new  Lander. 

Prior  to  unification,  a  housing  shortage  had  developed  in 
West  Germany  because  of  increased  immigration  and  the  rising 
number  of  single  householders.  The  arrival  of  several  million 
refugees,  ethnic  Germans,  and  eastern  Germans  coincided 
with  a  steep  drop  in  the  availability  of  inexpensive  housing. 
Despite  the  construction  of  as  many  as  400,000  new  dwellings 
each  year,  as  of  1993  the  need  for  housing  outpaced  the  supply. 
A  housing  shortage  exists  because  the  country's  35  million 
households  exceed  the  number  of  dwellings  by  about  500,000. 

The  housing  shortage  and  a  lack  of  available  land  for  build- 
ing in  densely  populated  areas  have  driven  up  real  estate 
prices.  In  1992  a  single-family  free-standing  house  with  125 
square  meters  of  floor  space  cost  DM300,000  in  Dresden, 
DM450,000  in  Hamburg,  DM590,000  in  Frankfurt  am  Main, 
DM800,000  in  Berlin,  and  DM910,000  in  Munich.  In  western 
Germany,  the  average  price  of  building  land  was  DM129  per 
square  meter,  compared  with  DM32  per  square  meter  in  the 
east. 

Because  decent  housing  is  seen  as  a  basic  right  in  Germany, 
the  government  provides  financial  aid  to  households  devoting 
too  great  a  share  of  their  income  to  housing  costs.  The  aid  can 
subsidize  their  rents  or  help  pay  mortgages.  In  the  early  1990s, 


171 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

some  3  million  households  received  this  type  of  aid.  Despite 
these  programs,  however,  homelessness  remains  a  problem.  In 
the  early  1990s,  some  specialists  estimated  the  number  of 
homeless  at  between  800,000  and  1  million,  while  others 
believed  it  to  be  as  low  as  150,000.  The  homeless  receive  aid 
from  government  and  charitable  organizations,  which  provide 
an  array  of  social  services  and  shelters  (see  Provisions  of  the 
Social  Welfare  System,  ch.  4). 

Religion 

Roman  Catholicism,  one  of  Germany's  two  principal  reli- 
gions, traces  its  origins  there  to  the  eighth-century  missionary 
work  of  Saint  Boniface  (see  Medieval  Germany,  ch.  1).  In  the 
next  centuries,  Roman  Catholicism  made  more  converts  and 
spread  eastward.  In  the  twelfth  and  thirteenth  centuries,  the 
Knights  of  the  Teutonic  Order  spread  German  and  Roman 
Catholic  influence  by  force  of  arms  along  the  southern  Baltic 
Coast  and  into  Russia.  In  1517,  however,  Martin  Luther  chal- 
lenged papal  authority  and  what  he  saw  as  the  commercializa- 
tion of  his  faith.  In  the  process,  Luther  changed  the  course  of 
European  and  world  history  and  established  the  second  major 
faith  in  Germany — Protestantism  (see  The  Protestant  Reforma- 
tion, ch.  1). 

Religious  differences  played  a  decisive  role  in  the  Thirty 
Years'  War  (see  The  Thirty  Years*  War,  1618-48,  ch.  1).  An 
enduring  legacy  of  the  Protestant  Reformation  and  this  con- 
flict was  the  division  of  Germany  into  fairly  distinct  regions  of 
religious  practice.  Roman  Catholicism  remained  the  preemi- 
nent faith  in  the  southern  and  western  German  states,  while 
Protestantism  became  firmly  established  in  the  northeastern 
and  central  regions.  Pockets  of  Roman  Catholicism  existed  in 
Oldenburg  in  the  north  and  in  areas  of  Hesse.  Protestant  con- 
gregations could  be  found  in  north  Baden  and  northeastern 
Bavaria. 

The  unification  of  Germany  in  1871  under  Prussian  leader- 
ship led  to  the  strengthening  of  Protestantism  (see  Bismarck 
and  Unification,  ch.  1).  Otto  von  Bismarck  sought  to  weaken 
Roman  Catholic  influence  through  an  anti-Roman  Catholic 
campaign,  the  Kulturkampf,  in  the  early  1870s.  The  Jesuit 
order  was  prohibited  in  Germany,  and  its  members  were 
expelled  from  the  country.  In  Prussia  the  "Falk  laws,"  named 
for  Adalbert  Falk,  Bismarck's  minister  of  culture,  mandated 
German  citizenship  and  attendance  at  German  universities  for 


172 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


clergymen,  state  inspection  of  schools,  and  state  confirmation 
of  parish  and  episcopal  appointments.  Although  relations 
between  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  and  the  state  were  subse- 
quently improved  through  negotiations  with  the  Vatican,  the 
Kulturkampf  engendered  in  Roman  Catholics  a  deep  distrust 
of  the  empire  and  enmity  toward  Prussia. 

Prior  to  World  War  II,  about  two-thirds  of  the  German  popu- 
lation was  Protestant  and  the  remainder  Roman  Catholic. 
Bavaria  was  a  Roman  Catholic  stronghold.  Roman  Catholics 
were  also  well  represented  in  the  populations  of 
Baden-Wurttemberg,  the  Saarland,  and  in  much  of  the  Rhine- 
land.  Elsewhere  in  Germany,  especially  in  the  north  and  north- 
east, Protestants  were  in  the  majority 

During  the  Hitler  regime,  except  for  individual  acts  of  resis- 
tance, the  established  churches  were  unable  or  unwilling  to 
mount  a  serious  challenge  to  the  supremacy  of  the  state  (see 
The  Third  Reich,  1933-45,  ch.  1).  A  Nazi,  Ludwig  Muller,  was 
installed  as  the  Lutheran  bishop  in  Berlin.  Although  raised  a 
Roman  Catholic,  Hitler  respected  only  the  power  and  organiza- 
tion of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  not  its  tenets.  In  July  1933, 
shortly  after  coming  to  power,  the  Nazis  scored  their  first  diplo- 
matic success  by  concluding  a  concordat  with  the  Vatican,  regu- 
lating church-state  relations.  In  return  for  keeping  the  right  to 
maintain  denominational  schools  nationwide,  the  Vatican 
assured  the  Nazis  that  Roman  Catholic  clergy  would  refrain 
from  political  activity,  that  the  government  would  have  a  say  in 
the  choice  of  bishops,  and  that  changes  in  diocesan  boundaries 
would  be  subject  to  government  approval.  However,  the  Nazis 
soon  violated  the  concordat's  terms,  and  by  the  late  1930s 
almost  all  denominational  schools  had  been  abolished. 

Toward  the  end  of  1933,  an  opposition  group  under  the 
leadership  of  Lutheran  pastors  Martin  Niemoller  and  Dietrich 
Bonhoeffer  formed  the  "Confessing  Church."  The  members  of 
this  church  opposed  the  takeover  of  the  Lutheran  Church  by 
the  Nazis.  Many  of  its  members  were  eventually  arrested,  and 
some  were  executed — among  them,  Bonhoeffer — by  the  end 
of  World  War  II. 

Postwar  Christianity 

The  postwar  division  of  Germany  left  roughly  equal  numbers 
of  Roman  Catholics  and  Protestants  in  West  Germany.  East 
Germany  had  five  times  as  many  Protestants  as  Roman  Catho- 
lics. There  the  authorities  waged  a  persistent  and  largely  suc- 


173 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

cessful  campaign  to  minimize  the  influence  and  authority  of 
the  Protestant  and  Roman  Catholic  churches. 

In  the  Federal  Republic,  freedom  of  religion  is  guaranteed 
by  Article  4  of  the  Basic  Law,  and  the  churches  enjoy  a  special 
legal  status  as  corporate  bodies.  In  theory,  there  is  constitu- 
tional separation  of  church  and  state,  but  church  financing 
complicates  this  separation.  To  support  churches  and  their 
work,  most  Germans  in  the  old  Lander  pay  a  voluntary  church 
tax,  amounting  to  an  8  or  9  percent  surcharge  on  income  tax 
paid.  Living  in  a  society  known  for  consensus  and  conformity, 
few  West  Germans  formally  withdrew  from  the  established 
churches  before  the  1980s  and  hence  continued  to  pay  the  tax. 

Beginning  in  the  1980s,  negative  attitudes  toward  the  tax 
and  the  churches  become  more  common,  and  people  began 
leaving  the  churches  in  significant  numbers.  Between  1980  and 
1992,  about  1.0  million  Roman  Catholics  and  1.2  million  Prot- 
estants gave  up  their  church  memberships.  A  faltering  econ- 
omy and  increased  taxes  caused  many  to  withdraw  for  financial 
reasons.  In  a  1992  poll,  approximately  42  percent  of  those  que- 
ried stated  that  the  church  tax  was  "much  too  high";  64  percent 
favored  abolishing  the  tax  and  supporting  the  churches 
through  voluntary  contributions.  Fourteen  percent  of  those 
Roman  Catholics  and  Protestants  polled  stated  that  they  were 
likely  to  withdraw  or  definitely  would  withdraw  from  their 
church. 

In  a  society  increasingly  materialist  and  secular,  the  spiritual 
and  moral  positions  of  the  churches  became  irrelevant  to 
many.  Among  the  younger  generation  seeking  autonomy  and 
self-fulfillment,  allegiance  was  no  longer  simply  surrendered 
without  question  to  institutions  of  authority.  Attendance  at  ser- 
vices dropped  off  significantly,  and  the  institution  of  the 
church  quietly  disappeared  from  the  lives  of  many  Germans. 

In  East  Germany,  although  the  constitution  theoretically 
provided  for  freedom  of  religion,  the  Marxist-Leninist  state 
placed  formidable  obstacles  before  those  seeking  to  exercise 
that  basic  right.  Enormous  pressure  was  exerted  on  citizens  to 
renounce  religion.  East  Germans  who  practiced  their  religion 
were  denied  educational  and  professional  opportunities,  for 
example.  Consequently,  at  unification  the  majority  of  East  Ger- 
mans were  either  not  baptized  or  had  left  their  church. 

In  the  1990s,  polls  in  the  new  Lander  revealed  that  more 
than  70  percent  of  East  Germans  did  not  believe  in  God.  Young 
people  were  even  less  religious.  Some  polls  found  that  only  16 


174 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


percent  of  East  German  schoolchildren  believed  in  God.  An 
entire  generation  had  been  raised  without  the  religious  rituals 
that  traditionally  had  marked  life's  milestones.  Secular  rituals 
had  been  substituted.  For  example,  the  Jugendweihe  (youth  ded- 
ication) gradually  supplanted  the  Christian  practice  of  confir- 
mation. 

After  unification  in  1990,  there  were  nominally  30.2  million 
Protestants  and  26.7  million  Roman  Catholics  in  united  Ger- 
many. Roman  Catholics  and  Protestants  combined  amounted 
to  about  76  percent  of  the  German  population  and  71  percent 
of  the  country's  total  population. 

Although  less  extreme  than  in  the  past,  attitudes  toward  reli- 
gion continue  to  polarize  German  society.  In  the  1990s,  espe- 
cially in  the  western  Lander,  attitudinal  differences  separate 
many  younger  Germans  with  humanistic  values  (concern  for 
the  environment,  the  rights  of  women  and  minorities,  and 
peace  and  disarmament  issues)  from  an  older  generation  who 
hold  traditional  religious  values.  Many  others  of  the  postwar 
generations  have  accepted  the  values  of  popular  culture  and 
consumerism  and  have  left  the  churches  because  they  no 
longer  seem  significant.  Millions  of  Germans  of  all  ages,  how- 
ever, continue  to  profess  a  religion  for  a  variety  of  reasons, 
among  them  strong  religious  beliefs,  social  pressure  to  con- 
form, preservation  of  educational  and  employment  opportuni- 
ties, support  for  essential  church  social-welfare  activities,  and 
(in  the  western  Lander)  the  enduring  appeal  of  Christian  ritu- 
als surrounding  baptism,  marriage,  and  burial. 

As  of  1995,  it  was  difficult  to  determine  to  what  extent  Ger- 
mans in  the  new  Lander  would  return  to  religion.  In  the  early 
1990s,  popular  magazines  featured  stories  about  the  "heatheni- 
zation"  of  Germany.  Although  such  a  provocative  characteriza- 
tion of  trends  seems  exaggerated,  the  incorporation  of  the 
former  East  Germany  did  dilute  religious  influence  in  united 
Germany.  Conversely,  however,  the  opening  of  eastern  Ger- 
many gave  missionaries  from  the  old  Lander  and  from  around 
the  world  the  chance  to  rekindle  religious  fervor.  In  the  old 
Lander,  the  churches  have  continued  their  vitally  important 
work  of  operating  an  extensive  network  of  hospitals,  nursing 
homes,  and  other  social  institutions.  The  need  for  such  ser- 
vices and  facilities  is  greatest  in  the  five  new  Lander,  and  the 
churches  quickly  stepped  in  to  help.

Roman  Catholicism 

With  about  28.2  million  members,  the  Roman  Catholic 
Church  in  unified  Germany  is  organized  into  five  archdioceses, 
eighteen  dioceses,  three  diocesan  offices,  and  one  apostolic 
administration.  Two  of  the  archdioceses  are  based  in  Bavaria 
(Munich/Freising  and  Bamberg)  and  two  in  North  Rhine- 
Westphalia  (Cologne  and  Paderborn).  More  than  57  percent 
of  all  German  Roman  Catholics  live  in  these  two  Lander. 
Another  28  percent  live  in  the  three  Lander  of  Baden-Wurttem- 
berg,  Hesse,  and  Rhineland-Palatinate.  Only  about  900  of  the 
church's  13,000  parishes  and  other  pastoral  centers  are  located 
in  the  new  Lander.  The  number  of  Roman  Catholics  in  East 
Germany  declined  from  2  million  shortly  after  the  war  to 
800,000  by  1992.  Serving  these  Roman  Catholics  are  two  dio- 
ceses, one  in  Brandenburg  (Berlin)  and  the  other  in  Saxony 
(Dresden). 

Between  1970  and  1989,  the  number  of  Roman  Catholics 
attending  Sunday  mass  in  West  Germany  declined  from  37  per- 
cent to  23  percent.  Between  1970  and  1990,  the  number  of 
annual  baptisms  fell  from  about  370,000  to  around  300,000. 
Approximately  470,000  Roman  Catholics  officially  left  the 
church  between  1985  and  1990.  In  the  same  period,  about 
25,000  returned  to  the  church,  and  another  25,000  converted 
to  other  religions. 

Despite  the  diminishing  numbers  of  Roman  Catholics,  the 
church  tax  enables  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  to  remain 
strong  financially.  In  1992  the  church's  share  of  tax  revenues 
amounted  to  approximately  DM8.5  billion.  An  additional  DM8 
billion  was  received  in  the  form  of  government  subsidies,  ser- 
vice payments,  property,  and  contributions.  Much  of  this  sup- 
port is  returned  to  society  through  an  extensive  network  of 
church-operated  kindergartens,  senior  citizen  centers,  and  hos- 
pitals. The  main  Roman  Catholic  charitable  organization  is  the 
Deutscher  Caritasverband,  which  had  about  400,000  employees 
in  1992. 

As  the  FRG  has  become  an  increasingly  secular  society,  the 
centuries-old  traditional  authority  of  the  Roman  Catholic 
Church  in  matters  of  morality  has  declined,  especially  among 
German  youth.  Many  German  Roman  Catholics  routinely 
ignore  the  church  and  in  particular  the  pope's  positions  on 
such  key  issues  as  birth  control,  premarital  sex,  divorce,  and 
abortion.  For  years  the  number  of  ordinations  in  Germany  has 
declined.  To  address  this  issue,  most  German  Catholics  favor 


176 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


permitting  priests  to  marry,  and  many  support  the  ordination 
of  women. 

Periodically,  independent  reformist  clergymen  challenge 
the  church  hierarchy  and  doctrine.  Often  they  do  so  with  the 
support  of  many  German  Catholics.  In  the  1970s,  Hans  Kiing,  a 
theologian  at  Tubingen  University,  used  his  position  and  cha- 
risma to  criticize  the  idea  of  papal  infallibility  and  other  dog- 
mas. In  the  early  1990s,  major  differences  of  opinion  between 
the  laity  and  church  authorities  were  revealed  by  a  clash 
between  a  reform-minded  priest  and  the  archbishop  in  Pader- 
born,  the  most  conservative  German  diocese.  For  beliefs 
deemed  contrary  to  Vatican  policies  and  dogma,  Father  Eugen 
Drewermann  was  defrocked  by  Archbishop  Johannes  Degen- 
hardt.  In  the  tradition  of  Luther,  Drewermann  continued  to 
express  his  unorthodox  views  outside  the  church — at  universi- 
ties and  in  the  media,  including  talk  shows.  A  1992  survey  indi- 
cated that  among  all  Germans,  Drewermann  was  more  popular 
than  Pope  John  Paul  II. 

Protestantism 

In  the  mid-1990s,  most  of  the  country's  roughly  30  million 
Protestants  were  organized  into  twenty-four  member  churches 
of  the  Evangelical  Church  in  Germany  (Evangelische  Kirche  in 
Deutschland — EKD),  headquartered  in  Hanover.  Later  in  the 
decade,  the  church's  headquarters  is  scheduled  to  relocate  to 
Berlin.  The  mainline  Protestant  churches  belong  to  one  of 
three  groups:  Lutheran  (ten);  Reformed,  or  Calvinist  (two); 
and  United,  or  Lutheran-Calvinist  (twelve).  The  largest  num- 
ber of  congregations  is  in  Saxony,  Berlin,  Brandenburg,  Lower 
Saxony,  Bavaria,  Thuringia,  and  Baden-Wurttemberg.  Protes- 
tant clergy  are  permitted  to  marry,  and  women  are  actively 
engaged  in  the  ministry.  One  of  the  most  prominent  women  in 
the  EKD  and  in  Germany  in  the  mid-1990s  was  Maria  Jepsen, 
bishop  of  Hamburg. 

In  the  early  1990s,  about  5  percent  of  German  Protestants 
attended  weekly  services.  Annual  baptisms  declined  from 
about  346,000  in  1970  to  around  257,000  in  1990.  Of  the 
257,000  baptisms  in  1990,  only  about  12  percent  took  place  in 
the  former  East  Germany.  Out  of  219,000  confirmations  in 
1990,  about  10  percent  involved  East  German  youth.  Like  their 
Roman  Catholic  counterparts,  Protestant  churches  are  well 
supported  by  taxes  and  contributions.  The  EKD  also  runs 
numerous  hospitals  and  other  social  institutions  and  is  a  vitally 


177 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 


important  member  of  the  country's  system  of  social  welfare. 
The  main  Protestant  charitable  organization  is  the  Diakon- 
isches  Werk;  it  has  about  350,000  employees. 

In  East  Germany,  Protestant  churches  became  a  focal  point 
of  opposition  during  the  1980s.  This  was  possible  because  of  an 
agreement  with  the  authorities  in  1978  that  granted  the 
churches  a  degree  of  independence.  Opposition  groups,  com- 
posed of  believers  and  nonbelievers  alike,  subsequently  were 
able  to  meet  at  the  churches,  where  they  discussed  peace  issues 
and  how  East  Germany  could  be  reformed.  In  1989  these 
churches,  in  particular  those  in  Leipzig,  became  staging  points 
for  the  massive  demonstrations  that  led  to  the  collapse  of  the 
communist  regime  (see  The  Peace  Movement  and  Internal 
Resistance,  ch.  2). 

Free  Churches 

The  free  churches  in  Germany  include  about  a  dozen  affili- 
ated but  independent  churches  and  congregations  that 
emerged  from  Protestant  renewal  movements,  primarily  in  the 
nineteenth  century.  Some  free  churches  practice  baptism,  and 
others  accept  a  simple  public  declaration  of  faith.  Prominent 
among  the  former  are  Baptists  and  Methodists,  who  set  up  reli- 
gious communities  in  Germany  in  1834  and  1849,  respectively. 
Methodism  was  brought  to  Germany  by  immigrants  returning 
from  the  United  States.  Since  1854  a  third  group,  the  Free 
Evangelical  Congregations,  has  practiced  baptism  of  believers, 
without  making  it  a  precondition  for  membership  in  the  con- 
gregation. 

Although  the  various  free  churches  follow  different  prac- 
tices, they  differ  from  the  two  main  religions  in  Germany  in 
that  they  are  independent  of  the  state.  The  free  churches,  see- 
ing themselves  as  "free  churches  in  a  free  country,"  seek  no  spe- 
cial treatment  from  the  state  and  are  funded  almost  exclusively 
by  members'  voluntary  contributions. 

The  emergence  of  these  independent  churches  was  accom- 
panied by  their  persecution  and  denunciation  as  sects.  For  this 
reason,  overcoming  prejudice  has  been  a  long  and  arduous 
process.  After  World  War  II,  the  free  churches  were  cofounders 
of  the  Study  Group  of  Christian  Churches  in  West  Germany 
and  West  Berlin.  They  used  this  organization  as  a  forum  for  fra- 
ternal interaction  with  other  churches. 

The  tenets  of  the  free  churches  stress  the  importance  of  the 
New  Testament,  freely  expressed  belief  in  Jesus  Christ  and  a  life 


178 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


of  service  devoted  to  him,  personal  piety,  and  the  sanctity  of 
human  life.  Conscientious  objection  to  military  service  is  a  part 
of  the  teachings  of  some  free  churches.  Many  free  churches 
emphasize  the  autonomy  of  the  local  parish  and  prefer  to  be 
called  a  community  rather  than  a  church. 

Since  1926  the  original  members  of  the  Free  Churches  in 
Germany  have  cooperated  with  one  another  through  the  Meet- 
ing of  Evangelical  Free  Churches.  These  churches  are  the  Asso- 
ciation  of  Evangelical  Free  Church  Congregations,  the 
Association  of  Free  Evangelical  Congregations,  and  the  Evan- 
gelical Methodist  Church.  Five  additional  churches  have  guest 
membership  status:  the  Christian  Study  Group  Mulheim/Ruhr, 
the  Sacred  Army  in  Germany,  the  European-Festland  Fraternal 
Uniate,  the  Church  of  the  Nazarene,  and  the  Association  of 
German  Mennonite  Communities.  These  eight  free  churches 
have  a  combined  membership  of  approximately  195,000,  orga- 
nized in  about  1,500  parishes  or  communities.  Almost  all  these 
churches  are  legal  corporate  bodies. 

In  recent  years,  the  free  churches'  interaction  and  coopera- 
tion with  the  established  Protestant  churches  have  intensified. 
A  few  such  activities  include  missionary  work,  Bible  groups, 
and  humanitarian  efforts  such  as  "Bread  for  the  World." 

Orthodox  Churches 

Eastern  Orthodox  Christianity  in  Germany  derives  mainly 
from  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  Serbs  who  came  to  the 
country  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  as  Gastarbeiter.  The  breakup  of 
the  former  Yugoslavia  in  the  early  1990s  caused  thousands 
more  Serbs  to  come  to  Germany.  Many  of  the  Slavs  from  other 
East  European  countries  also  belong  to  the  Eastern  Orthodox 
Church.  Germany's  large  Greek  population  belongs  mostly  to 
the  Greek  Orthodox  Church. 

Judaism 

When  Hitler  came  to  power  in  1933,  approximately  600,000 
Jews  lived  in  Germany,  some  of  whom  were  among  the  most 
prominent  members  of  society.  Over  the  next  twelve  years, 
most  fled  or  were  murdered,  along  with  millions  of  East  Euro- 
pean Jews,  Slavs,  and  other  nationalities.  As  of  January  1992, 
seventy-six  Jewish  congregations  and  Land  associations  had 
about  34,000  members,  with  the  largest  communities  located  in 
Berlin  and  Frankfurt  am  Main.  In  the  late  1980s  and  early 
1990s,  several  thousand  Soviet  Jews  of  German  ancestry  took 


179 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

advantage  of  liberalized  Soviet  emigration  policies  and  Ger- 
man naturalization  laws  and  resettled  in  the  Federal  Republic. 
However,  since  unification  in  1990  and  the  outbreak  of  radical 
right-wing  violence,  some  in  the  Jewish  community,  remember- 
ing similar  events  in  the  1930s,  have  left.  Although  most  hate- 
crimes  and  violence  have  been  aimed  at  foreign  workers  and 
asylum-seekers,  there  have  been  scattered  incidents  of  attacks 
on  Jewish  synagogues  and  memorials. 

Islam 

Following  the  influx  of  foreign  laborers  in  the  1960s  and 
early  1970s,  Islam  established  a  religious  presence  in  Germany, 
making  it  the  religion  with  the  country's  third  largest  member- 
ship. As  of  1994,  approximately  2  million  Muslims  resided  in 
Germany.  Most  of  the  Muslims  are  either  Turkish,  Kurdish,  Ira- 
nian, or  Palestinian.  Additional  Muslims  have  entered  the 
country  as  refugees,  fleeing  the  ethnic  and  religious  conflict  in 
the  former  Yugoslavia. 

Social  Structure  and  Social  Mobility 

Despite  continuing  although  lessening  differences  in  living 
standards  between  the  old  and  new  Lander,  in  the  mid-1990s 
German  social  structure  consists  mainly  of  a  large,  prosperous 
central  stratum  containing  about  60  percent  of  the  population. 
This  stratum  includes  mid-level  civil  servants,  most  salaried 
employees,  skilled  blue-collar  workers,  and  a  shrinking  pool  of 
farmers.  A  smaller  wealthier  group  consisting  of  an  upper-mid- 
dle class  and  an  upper  class  offsets  the  poverty  experienced  by 
a  poor  lower  class.  Hence  in  terms  of  social  indicators  such  as 
education,  average  income,  and  property  ownership,  Germany 
ranks  among  the  world's  leading  countries.  In  terms  of  income, 
for  example,  in  1991  the  average  German  family  had  a  net 
monthly  income  of  DM4,905,  second  highest  among  members 
of  the  EC. 

Social  Structure 

Most  of  the  workforce  is  employed  in  the  services  sector. 
West  Germany  completed  the  transition  from  an  industrial 
economy  to  one  dominated  by  the  services  sector  in  the  1970s, 
and  by  the  late  1980s  this  sector  employed  two-thirds  of  the 
workforce.  In  contrast,  when  the  Berlin  Wall  fell,  East  Germany 
still  had  not  made  this  transition.  Because  more  of  the  work-

force  was  engaged  in  industry  and  agriculture  than  in  the  ser- 
vices sector,  its  socioeconomic  structure  resembled  that  of  West 
Germany  in  1965. 

Rainer  Geissler,  a  German  sociologist,  has  examined  his 
country's  social  structure  in  light  of  the  economic  changes  that 
have  taken  place  in  the  postwar  era.  Because  of  the  growth  of 
the  services  sector  and  the  doubling  of  state  employees  since 
1950,  he  has  discarded  earlier  divisions  of  German  society  into 
an  elite  class,  middle  class,  and  worker  class,  with  a  small  ser- 
vices class  consisting  of  employees  of  all  levels.  He  has  replaced 
this  division  with  a  more  nuanced  model  that  better  reflects 
these  postwar  changes.  As  the  economy  of  the  new  Lander  is 
incorporated  into  the  western  economy,  its  much  simpler 
social  structure  (elite,  self-employed,  salaried  employees,  and 
workers)  will  come  to  resemble  that  of  the  old  Lander. 

According  to  Geissler,  at  the  end  of  the  1980s  West  Ger- 
many's largest  group  (28  percent  of  the  population)  was  an 
educated  salaried  middle  class,  employed  either  in  the  services 
sector  or  in  the  manufacturing  sector  as  educated,  white-collar 
employees.  Some  members  of  this  group  earned  very  high  sala- 
ries; others  earned  skilled  blue-collar  wages.  This  professional 
class  has  expanded  at  the  expense  of  the  old  middle  class, 
which  amounted  to  only  7  percent  of  the  population  at  the  end 
of  the  1980s.  A  less  educated  segment  of  the  services  sector,  or 
white-collar  employee  sector,  amounted  to  9  percent  of  the 
population.  Geissler  divided  the  working  class  into  three 
groups:  an  elite  of  the  best-trained  and  best-paid  workers  (12 
percent);  skilled  workers  (18  percent),  about  5  percent  of 
whom  are  foreigners;  and  unskilled  workers  (15  percent), 
about  25  percent  of  whom  are  foreigners.  A  portion  of  this  last 
group  live  below  the  poverty  line.  Farmers  and  their  families 
make  up  6  percent  of  the  population.  At  the  top  of  his  model 
of  the  social  structure,  Geissler  posits  an  elite  of  less  than  1  per- 
cent. 

The  Elite 

During  the  centuries  when  Germany  was  a  collection  of 
medium-and  small-sized  states,  wealth  and  power  were  concen- 
trated in  the  hands  of  the  nobility,  landed  gentry,  and  wealthy 
merchants  in  the  cities.  With  the  collapse  of  the  German 
Empire  in  1918,  the  nobility  and  landed  gentry  suffered  a 
major  setback,  but  they  still  retained  much  power  and  influ- 
ence. During  the  interwar  years,  however,  much  political  power 


182 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


devolved  to  representatives  of  other  classes.  A  vivid  illustration 
of  the  transfer  of  power  was  former  army  corporal  Adolf  Hit- 
ler's assumption  of  the  German  presidency  following  the  death 
of  General  Paul  von  Hindenburg  in  1934. 

The  old  propertied  and  monied  elites  suffered  an  additional 
loss  of  power  after  World  War  II.  In  the  new  worker-dominated 
GDR,  they  saw  their  property  confiscated  and  their  power  evap- 
orate. West  German  society  was  transformed  by  the  rapidly 
expanding  social  market  economy  and  the  migration  of  mil- 
lions of  displaced  persons  from  the  east,  many  of  whom  were 
well  educated  and  capable.  Some  of  the  old  elite  and  their  off- 
spring retained  positions  of  influence  (most  notably  in  the  mil- 
itary and  the  diplomatic  corps),  but  to  an  extent  greater  than 
ever  before,  the  elite  class  became  open  to  society  as  a  whole. 

According  to  Geissler,  Germany's  elite  numbers  just  a  few 
thousand,  less  than  1  percent  of  the  population,  but  its  influ- 
ence far  outweighs  its  numbers.  The  elite  consists  of  persons 
occupying  key  positions  in  such  social  sectors  as  business,  poli- 
tics, labor  unions,  the  civil  service,  the  media,  and  the 
churches.  Membership  in  the  elite  is  based  on  performance 
and  is  rarely  inherited.  For  this  reason,  Germany's  elite  is  plu- 
ralist in  nature  because  members  of  lower  social  strata  can 
enter  it  by  rising  to  the  top  of  a  social  sector.  The  openness  of 
elite  positions  varies.  Sons  of  workers  routinely  come  to  hold 
high  positions  in  labor  unions  or  in  the  SPD,  but  rarely  in 
banking  or  the  diplomatic  corps.  A  vital  criterion  for  advance- 
ment is  a  university  degree,  most  notably  a  law  degree,  because 
about  one-third  of  Germany's  elite  consists  of  lawyers. 

Entry  into  East  Germany's  elite  was  determined  almost 
exclusively  by  ideological  considerations.  Small  and 
entrenched,  the  East  German  elite  has  been  characterized  as 
monopolistic,  in  contrast  to  that  of  the  West  German  elite, 
where  numerous  groups  shared  or  competed  for  power.  Most 
of  the  GDR  elite  has  lost  power  since  the  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall. 
As  a  result,  a  new  elite  similar  to  the  pluralistic  elite  of  the  old 
Lander  \s  forming  in  the  new  Lander. 

The  Self-Employed 

The  self-employed  provide  a  service  on  their  own  or  are  the 
owners  of  firms  that  provide  a  service  or  a  product.  In  West 
Germany  in  1989,  the  self-employed  constituted  8.8  percent  of 
the  workforce,  compared  with  16.0  percent  in  1950;  their 
decline  was  even  steeper  in  East  Germany,  from  20.4  to  2.2  per- 


183

cent  over  the  same  period.  The  self-employed  are  a  heteroge- 
neous group,  encompassing  shipping  magnates  and 
seamstresses  and  artists  and  gas  station  owners.  As  a  result,  the 
earnings  of  the  group's  members  vary  considerably — some 
members  are  wealthy,  most  rank  in  the  upper  middle  or  middle 
class  in  terms  of  income  and  social  prestige,  and  some  (about  7 
percent  of  this  group)  are  poor.  Excluding  farmers,  annual 
household  income  of  the  self-employed  in  the  old  Lander  in 
1991  amounted  to  about  DM150,000,  almost  triple  the  average 
household  income. 

As  property  owners  and  food  producers,  farmers  are  a  small 
but  significant  part  of  the  self-employed.  In  both  Germanys, 
the  number  of  farmers  fell  dramatically  in  the  postwar  era:  in 
the  west,  from  5  million  (or  10  percent  of  the  population)  in 
1950  to  864,000  (or  1.4  percent)  in  1989;  in  the  east,  from 
740,000  in  1951  to  only  3,000  in  the  early  1990s. 

A  typical  agricultural  enterprise  in  the  old  Lander  is  a  small- 
or  medium-sized  farm  worked  by  the  owner,  assisted  by  one  or 
two  family  members.  Some  farmers  are  wealthy,  while  others 
only  earn  a  bare  subsistence.  Farmers'  average  household 
income  is  lower  than  that  of  most  other  self-employed  but  is 
about  25  percent  higher  than  the  national  average. 

Salaried  Employees 

The  number  of  salaried  employees  grew  greatly  in  the  post- 
war era  in  West  Germany,  from  16  percent  of  the  workforce  in 
1950,  to  33  percent  in  1974,  and  to  42  percent  in  1989.  Salaried 
employees  work  in  three  main  areas:  commercial,  technical, 
and  administrative.  In  1989,  68  percent  of  salaried  employees 
worked  in  the  services  sector  and  32  percent  in  industry. 

Geissler  divides  salaried  employees  (including  civil  servants) 
into  two  groups:  a  lower  group  that  performs  simple  routine 
tasks  (hairdressers,  salesclerks,  bus  drivers,  and  low-level  civil 
servants  such  as  letter  carriers)  and  that  in  1989  accounted  for 
9  percent  of  West  Germany's  population;  and  an  upper  group 
with  advanced  education  and  responsibility,  often  unsuper- 
vised, that  performs  complex  tasks  (accountants,  teachers,  law- 
yers, and  engineers)  and  that  accounted  for  28  percent  of  the 
population.  The  jobs  of  the  upper  group  often  involve  much 
stress,  and  half  its  members  have  complained  of  it,  compared 
with  less  than  one-fourth  of  skilled  workers. 

In  1988  the  households  of  salaried  employees  in  West  Ger- 
many earned  on  the  whole  36  percent  more  than  workers' 


184 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


households.  Studies  have  found  that  despite  their  modest 
social  prestige  and  income,  only  13  percent  of  the  lower  group 
of  salaried  employees  regard  themselves  as  workers.  Salaried 
employees  as  a  whole  see  themselves  as  belonging  to  the  mid- 
dle class.  According  to  various  studies  cited  by  Geissler,  the 
social  animosity  that  prevailed  between  salaried  employees  and 
workers  in  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth  century  has  evolved 
into  a  more  subtle  sense  of  belonging  to  different  groups.  This 
feeling  of  distinctness  is  most  strongly  felt  by  salaried  employ- 
ees far  removed  from  the  workbench,  for  example,  those  in 
banking. 

Generally  speaking,  salaried  employees  tend  to  believe  that 
they  must  look  out  for  themselves  on  an  individual  basis,  rather 
than  collectively,  as  is  more  common  among  workers.  The 
higher  salaried  employees  rise  in  their  profession,  the  more 
likely  this  is  to  be  the  case.  In  consequence,  a  smaller  portion 
of  salaried  employees  are  members  of  labor  unions  than  are 
workers. 

Civil  Servants 

Civil  servants  (Beamteri)  have  a  long  tradition  in  Germany. 
Their  number  more  than  doubled  between  1950  and  1989, 
from  790,000  to  1.8  million  in  West  Germany,  where  they 
accounted  for  6.6  percent  of  the  workforce.  Because  teachers 
and  professors  are  civil  servants  in  Germany,  much  of  this 
increase  came  from  the  expansion  of  education  in  the  postwar 
era.  Only  about  one-third  of  those  working  for  the  state  are 
regarded  as  civil  servants.  The  remainder  are  either  hourly  or 
salaried  employees  without  the  special  status  and  rights  of  civil 
servants.  In  1989  civil  servants  and  government  employees 
accounted  for  16.6  percent  of  the  workforce. 

Civil  servants  have  complete  job  security,  generous  pensions, 
and  higher  net  incomes  than  salaried  employees.  In  return  for 
these  advantages,  civil  servants  are  to  serve  the  state  loyally  and 
carry  out  their  duties  in  a  nonpartisan  way.  This  does  not,  how- 
ever, prevent  civil  servants  from  being  active  in  politics  and 
even  being  elected  to  public  office. 

Workers 

Although  West  Germany  became  primarily  a  services-sector 
economy  in  the  1970s,  blue-collar  workers  remain  a  vitally 
important  segment  of  the  workforce,  even  though  they  are  out- 
numbered by  salaried  employees.  At  the  end  of  the  1980s, 


185 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

workers  accounted  for  two-fifths  of  the  workforce  in  West  Ger- 
many, a  drop  from  three-fifths  in  1900  and  slightly  more  than 
one-half  in  1960.  The  social  market  economy  and  powerful 
trade  unions  greatly  improved  workers'  working  conditions,  job 
security,  and  living  standards  in  the  postwar  era.  Between  1970 
and  1989,  for  example,  their  average  net  earnings  increased  41 
percent  in  real  terms,  more  than  any  other  group  except  for 
the  self-employed  (not  including  farmers)  and  pensioners.  In 
the  1980s,  about  43  percent  of  skilled  workers  and  29  percent 
of  unskilled  or  partially  trained  workers  lived  in  their  own 
houses  or  apartments;  automobile  ownership  and  lengthy  vaca- 
tions (often  abroad)  had  become  the  rule. 

As  a  result  of  these  changes,  German  workers  no  longer  live 
separately  from  the  rest  of  society  as  was  the  case  in  the  nine- 
teenth century  and  for  much  of  the  twentieth  century.  The 
gradual,  so-called  deproletarianization  has  caused  some  sociol- 
ogists to  maintain  that  it  is  no  longer  accurate  to  speak  of  Ger- 
man workers  as  a  separate  social  group.  Geissler  is  aware  of  the 
much-improved  living  standards  of  the  workers  and  the  grad- 
ual disappearance  of  a  proletarian  lifestyle,  but  he  maintains 
that  workers  still  constitute  a  distinct  group  because  their  earn- 
ings are  lower  than  average,  their  work  is  physically  demanding 
and  closely  supervised,  and  their  children's  opportunities  for 
social  advancement  are  not  as  good  as  those  of  most  other 
groups.  In  addition,  most  workers  still  regard  themselves  as 
members  of  the  working  class,  although  a  growing  percentage 
see  themselves  as  middle  class. 

According  to  Geissler,  the  working  class  is  composed  of  three 
distinct  subgroups:  elite,  skilled,  and  unskilled  or  partially 
trained  workers.  In  the  mid-1980s,  about  12  percent  of  the  pop- 
ulation lived  in  the  households  of  the  worker  elite,  19  percent 
in  those  of  skilled  workers,  and  16  percent  in  those  of  the 
unskilled. 

The  worker  elite,  which  is  composed  of  supervisors  and 
highly  trained  personnel,  enjoys  better  pay  than  the  other 
groups.  Its  work  is  less  physically  demanding  and  resembles 
that  of  salaried  employees.  Only  one-third  of  the  sons  of  the 
worker  elite  remain  workers,  and  about  one-half  of  the  group 
see  themselves  as  members  of  the  middle  class. 

Skilled  workers  have  completed  a  set  course  of  vocational 
training.  This  group  has  expanded  in  recent  decades  and  in 
the  early  1990s  outnumbered  the  unskilled,  which  even  as  late 
as  1970  accounted  for  57  percent  of  workers. 


186 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Unskilled  workers  perform  the  poorest  paid  and  dirtiest 
tasks.  Foreigners  account  for  about  25  percent  of  this  group 
and  German  women  for  about  38  percent.  A  portion  of  this 
group  lives  below  the  poverty  line.  In  addition  to  their  other 
burdens,  the  unskilled  are  most  likely  to  become  unemployed 
and  involved  in  criminal  activity. 

The  Poor 

As  a  large,  urbanized,  industrial  country  with  a  diverse  popu- 
lation, Germany  has  a  portion  of  its  population  living  in  pov- 
erty. The  European  Union  (EU — see  Glossary)  classifies  as 
poor  those  households  that  have  less  than  half  the  average  net 
income.  According  to  this  definition,  in  1992  approximately 
7.5  percent  of  the  population  in  the  old  Lander  and  14.8  per- 
cent in  the  new  Lander  were  poor.  The  number  of  poor  has 
been  growing  since  1970,  when  the  number  of  those  receiving 
social  assistance  reached  its  lowest  point  of  750,000.  In  the 
early  1990s,  one  study  estimated  that  in  1992  there  were  4.6 
million  recipients  of  various  kinds  of  social  assistance,  nearly 
700,000  of  whom  lived  in  the  new  Lander.  Households  with 
three  or  more  children  and  single  parents  were  the  most  likely 
recipients  of  social  assistance. 

Social  Mobility 

Upward  social  mobility,  or  the  ability  or  chance  of  offspring 
to  improve  their  social  position  relative  to  that  of  their  parents, 
expanded  in  both  Germanys  during  the  postwar  era.  The 
growth  of  the  services  sector  was  the  primary  cause  of  this 
expansion.  The  large,  well-trained  workforce  required  by  this 
sector  was  supplied  by  a  greatly  expanded  education  system.  As 
a  result,  many  Germans  received  a  better  education  than  had 
their  parents. 

The  postwar  era  saw  the  formation  of  a  large,  newly  edu- 
cated middle  class,  which  grew  at  the  expense  of  the  small  tra- 
ditional middle  class,  many  of  whose  members  were  merchants 
and  the  owners  of  small  firms.  Joining  this  older  middle  class 
was  difficult  because  membership  required  capital,  property, 
and  other  kinds  of  assets.  For  this  reason,  it  was  a  relatively 
closed  class,  and  its  members  were  usually  the  offspring  of 
existing  members.  By  contrast,  joining  the  new  professional 
middle  class  depended  on  academic  training,  something 
readily  available  in  postwar  West  Germany,  where  education 
was  inexpensive  and  financial  aid  was  easily  obtainable. 


187 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

One  study  measuring  social  mobility  in  the  postwar  decades 
used  a  six-level  model  to  track  Germans  born  between  1930 
and  1949.  It  found  that  20  percent  had  moved  up  to  the  next 
higher  level,  10  percent  had  moved  up  two  levels,  and  2  per- 
cent had  moved  up  three  levels.  Some  downward  mobility  was 
recorded  as  well.  For  example,  1  percent  had  dropped  three 
levels. 

Opportunities  for  upward  social  mobility  varied,  however, 
according  to  one's  place  in  society.  Blue-collar  workers,  for 
example,  did  not  show  as  much  social  mobility  as  other  classes, 
although  their  mobility  increased  somewhat  in  the  late  postwar 
decades.  A  commonly  used  index  to  measure  social  mobility  is 
the  percentage  of  sons  remaining  within  the  social  stratum  or 
milieu  of  their  fathers.  West  German  studies  have  shown  that  in 
1970  only  5  percent  of  blue-collar  workers'  sons  managed  to 
move  up  into  better  paying,  higher  status  professions  in  the  ser- 
vices sector.  By  1979  the  percentage  had  more  than  doubled  to 
11  percent.  The  percentage  of  sons  of  lower-level  salaried  and 
public-sector  employees  moving  into  elevated  professional 
positions  had  increased  from  12  to  22  percent  in  the  same 
period. 

Another  study  examined  the  likelihood  of  different  groups 
securing  a  position  in  the  two  top  levels  of  the  services  sector. 
The  first  and  upper  level  accounts  for  about  10  percent  of  total 
employment  and  consists  of  positions  in  medicine,  law,  higher 
education,  upper  levels  of  administration,  and  the  like.  The 
second  and  lower  level  accounts  for  about  15  percent  of 
employment  and  consists  of  positions  in  teaching,  mid-level 
management,  retailing,  computers,  and  the  like.  The  study 
found  that  about  two-thirds  of  those  employed  in  the  top  level 
and  nearly  three-fifths  of  those  in  the  second  level  are  the  off- 
spring of  persons  employed  in  these  levels.  Only  about  20  per- 
cent of  the  sons  of  workers  are  employed  in  these  levels.  Access 
to  the  top  level  is  very  restricted,  with  4  percent  of  the  sons  of 
skilled  workers  and  2  percent  of  the  sons  of  unskilled  workers 
employed  there.  Almost  no  farmers'  sons  move  into  the  top  lev- 
els. 

Geissler  has  found  three  occupational  categories  particularly 
conducive  to  upward  mobility:  the  self-employed,  the  nonman- 
ual  service  providers,  and  the  worker  elite.  Self-recruitment  in 
the  three  categories  is  relatively  low.  Geissler  holds  that  this 
indicates  that  the  offspring  of  those  so  employed  are  finding 
higher  status  positions.  In  contrast  to  these  groups,  93  percent 


188 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 

of  farmers  are  the  sons  of  farmers;  farmers'  offspring  who  leave 
the  farm  usually  become  either  skilled  or  unskilled  workers. 

As  of  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  social  mobility  trends  in  the 
new  Lander  had  not  yet  stabilized.  Both  upward  and  downward 
mobility  are  greater  than  in  the  old  Lander.  The  widespread  dis- 
qualification of  the  GDR  elite  meant  downward  mobility  for 
many.  The  rapid  transformation  of  the  social  structure  through 
the  replacement  of  a  command  socialist  economy  with  a  social 
market  economy  is  also  causing  much  social  mobility,  especially 
between  generations.  Children  often  do  not  work  in  the  same 
sector  as  their  parents.  A  new  social  class  of  entrepreneurs  is 
being  formed  as  the  new  Lander  become  integrated  into  the 
western  economy. 

The  Search  for  a  New  National  Identity 

In  the  aftermath  of  unification,  Germans  are  searching  for  a 
new  identity.  There  appear  to  be  at  least  two  distinct  German 
identities,  and  obstacles  to  their  speedy  fusion  seem  formida- 
ble. 

In  the  postwar  period,  West  Germany  became  an  upwardly 
mobile,  success-oriented  society.  By  1990  a  broad  and  prosper- 
ous middle-class  and  upper-middle-class  society  had  developed. 
Although  they  still  worked  hard  to  earn  the  vacation  and  work- 
ing conditions  among  the  best  in  the  world,  West  Germans 
sought  to  create  a  "leisure  society."  There  was  a  movement,  for 
example,  advocating  the  adoption  of  a  four-day  workweek. 
Work  was  intrinsically  less  important  to  West  Germans  than  to 
East  Germans;  instead,  they  prized  personal  fulfillment,  recre- 
ation, health,  and  the  natural  environment. 

Through  a  remarkable  transformation,  West  Germans  had 
rehabilitated  themselves,  had  become  internationally  oriented, 
and  had  assumed  a  leading  role  within  the  larger  European 
community.  Members  of  the  older  generation,  especially  those 
"blessed  by  a  late  birth"  (too  young  to  be  Nazis),  were 
self-assured  and  proud  of  the  Federal  Republic's  political,  eco- 
nomic, and  social  achievements.  Starting  in  the  1960s,  the 
younger  generation  discovered  new  freedoms  and  exercised 
them.  In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  youth-  and  student-led  protests 
were  mounted  against  nuclear  weapons  and  nuclear  power 
plants  and  in  favor  of  peace,  disarmament,  and  environmental 
protection. 

By  the  early  1990s,  most  of  the  1960s  generation  had  been 
assimilated  into  the  German  establishment,  but  its  experiences 


189 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

in  challenging  authority  and  winning  concessions  produced 
evolutionary  changes  in  German  society  economy,  and  cul- 
ture. This  generation's  influence  could  be  seen  in  the  huge 
candlelight  vigils  staged  by  people  of  all  ages  to  protest 
right-wing  violence  and  xenophobia. 

On  the  other  side  of  the  fortified  border,  East  German  soci- 
ety was  decidedly  working  class,  with  comparatively  minor  class 
distinctions.  Where  there  were  significant  income  differentials, 
the  extra  money  was  of  little  consequence  in  an  economy 
marked  by  shortages  of  most  consumer  goods.  The  state  appa- 
ratus provided  security  in  the  form  of  guaranteed  employment, 
free  education  and  health  care,  and  subsidized  low  rent. 
Homelessness  was  unknown  in  the  GDR.  Other  social  ills  such 
as  violent  crime,  drug  abuse,  and  prostitution  also  were  much 
less  prevalent  than  in  the  west. 

In  terms  of  their  attitude  toward  state  authority  and  the  fam- 
ily, easterners  manifested  values  characteristic  of  westerners  in 
the  late  1950s  and  1960s.  On  the  factory  floor  or  the  collective 
farm,  conditions  were  often  primitive  and  the  workweek  long 
(forty-three  or  more  hours).  The  workforce,  too,  was  reminis- 
cent of  an  earlier  Germany,  with  greater  numbers  employed  in 
smokestack  industries  or  in  fields  and  mines,  and  far  fewer  in 
the  services  or  information  sector.  One  of  many  revelations 
after  unification  was  the  information  illiteracy  of  easterners. 

With  few  external  options  or  diversions,  East  Germans  iden- 
tified with  home  and  family  more  than  their  counterparts  in 
the  west.  Deprived  of  the  means  and  liberty  to  travel  outside 
communist  Eastern  Europe,  they  formed  what  some  sociolo- 
gists called  a  "niche  society,"  retreating  into  an  inner  circle  to 
find  a  degree  of  privacy. 

For  three  generations,  East  Germans  had  been  indoctri- 
nated in  the  thought  processes  of  two  forms  of  totalitarianism 
in  succession:  nazism  and  communism.  With  the  collapse  of 
communism,  Germans  living  in  the  new  Lander  had  few  values 
and  beliefs,  aside  from  personal  ones,  with  which  to  identify. 
Embittered  by  the  seemingly  imperialistic  imposition  of  all 
things  West  German,  some  easterners  developed  "an  identity  of 
defiance"  ( Trotzidentitat) . 

In  the  initial  stage  of  union,  Germans  focused  on  the  pro- 
found differences  that  had  evolved  in  the  two  states  since  the 
end  of  World  War  II.  In  the  Federal  Republic,  one  of  the 
world's  wealthiest  countries,  quality-of-life  issues  played  key 
roles  in  defining  one's  place  and  identity  in  society.  Home  own- 


190 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


ership,  travel  experiences,  and  leisure  activities  of  all  kinds 
were  translated  into  powerful  status  symbols. 

In  stark  contrast,  the  state  owned  practically  all  property  in 
East  Germany.  Expectations  of  improving  individual  or  family 
lifestyles  were  modest.  Overall,  the  eastern  Ldnderwere  decades 
behind  the  west  in  most  categories  measuring  standard  of  liv- 
ing. Coming  from  a  society  grown  accustomed  to  measuring 
itself  and  others  by  the  yardstick  of  material  prosperity,  it  was 
not  surprising  that  West  Germans  felt  more  in  common  with 
their  neighbors  to  the  west,  in  whose  countries  they  frequently 
traveled. 

In  some  respects,  the  former  GDR  stood  in  relation  to  the 
FRG  as  a  colony  to  an  imperial  power,  and  it  was  not  long 
before  westerners  and  easterners  began  acting  out  the  roles  of 
"know-it-alls"  (westerners)  and  "whimpering  easterners." 
Within  several  years  of  the  opening  of  the  Berlin  Wall,  the 
former  East  Germany  was  transformed  from  a  full-employment 
society  to  one  having  more  than  1  million  unemployed  and 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  part-time  workers. 

Forced  resocialization  has  weighed  heavily  on  eastern  Ger- 
mans' self-esteem.  The  cleft  between  east  and  west  is  suffi- 
ciently deep  and  wide  to  make  easterners  appear  to  be 
foreigners  in  their  own  land,  or  at  best  second-class  citizens.  By 
August  1992,  the  situation  had  deteriorated  to  the  point  where 
a  headline  on  the  cover  of  Der  Spiegel,  the  influential  weekly 
magazine,  summed  it  up  in  three  words:  "Germans  Against 
Germans." 

In  modern  European  history,  the  merging  of  two  fundamen- 
tally different  social,  political,  and  economic  systems  such  as 
those  that  evolved  in  the  two  Germanys  has  no  precedent.  For- 
tunately for  the  newly  united  country,  most  Germans  still  rely 
on  the  traditional  traits  of  diligence,  orderliness,  discipline, 
and  thrift,  and  these  shared  values  ultimately  should  resolve 
the  problems  associated  with  the  merger  of  two  states  and  soci- 
eties at  vastly  different  levels  of  development  and  achievement.

Chapter  4.  Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and 

Education 


Ludwig  van  Beethoven,  1 770-1827,  received  his  early  music  training  in  Bonn. 


THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  SOCIAL  POLICY  in  Germany  has 
followed  a  unique  historical  path.  During  a  long  process  of 
growth  and  social  experimentation,  Germany  combined  a  vig- 
orous and  highly  competitive  capitalist  economy  with  a  social 
welfare  system  that,  with  some  exceptions,  has  provided  its  citi- 
zens cradle-to-grave  security.  The  system's  benefits  are  so  exten- 
sive that  by  the  1990s  annual  total  spending  by  the  state, 
employers,  and  private  households  on  health  care,  pensions, 
and  other  aspects  of  what  Germans  call  the  social  safety  net 
amounted  to  roughly  DM1  trillion  (for  value  of  the  deutsche 
mark — see  Glossary)  and  accounted  for  about  one-third  of  the 
country's  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary).  Unlike 
many  of  the  world's  advanced  countries,  however,  Germany 
does  not  provide  its  citizens  with  health  care,  pensions,  and 
other  social  welfare  benefits  through  a  centralized  state-run  sys- 
tem. Rather,  it  provides  these  benefits  via  a  complex  network  of 
national  agencies  and  a  large  number  of  independent  regional 
and  local  entities — some  public,  some  quasi-public,  and  many 
private  and  voluntary.  Many  of  these  structures  date  from  the 
nineteenth  century,  and  some  from  much  earlier. 

The  legislation  that  established  the  basis  of  this  system  dates 
from  the  1880s  and  was  passed  by  imperial  Germany's  parlia- 
ment, the  Reichstag,  with  the  dual  purpose  of  helping  German 
workers  meet  life's  vicissitudes  and  thereby  making  them  less 
susceptible  to  socialism.  This  legislation  set  the  main  principles 
that  have  guided  the  development  of  social  policy  in  Germany 
to  the  present  day:  membership  in  insurance  programs  is  man- 
dated by  law;  the  administration  of  these  programs  is  delegated 
to  nonstate  bodies  with  representatives  of  the  insured  and 
employers;  entitlement  to  benefits  is  linked  to  past  contribu- 
tions rather  than  need;  benefits  and  contributions  are  related 
to  earnings;  and  financing  is  secured  through  wage  taxes  levied 
on  the  employer  and  the  employee  and,  depending  on  the  pro- 
gram, sometimes  through  additional  state  financing. 

These  insurance  programs  were  developed  from  the  bottom 
up.  They  first  covered  elements  of  the  working  class  and  then 
extended  coverage  to  ever  broader  segments  of  the  population 
and  incorporated  additional  risks.  Over  time,  these  programs 
came  to  provide  a  wide  net  of  entitlements  to  those  individuals 
having  a  steady  work  history.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

By  international  standards,  the  German  welfare  system  is 
comprehensive  and  generous.  However,  not  everyone  benefits 
equally.  In  the  mid-1990s,  the  so-called  safety  net  was  deficient 
for  the  lower-income  strata  and  the  unemployed.  It  was  also 
inadequate  for  persons  needing  what  Germans  term  "social 
aid,"  that  is,  assistance  in  times  of  hardship.  In  1994,  for  exam- 
ple, 4.6  million  persons  needed  social  aid,  a  100  percent 
increase  since  the  1980s.  Germans  who  had  been  citizens  of  the 
former  German  Democratic  Republic  (GDR,  or  East  Ger- 
many), which  became  part  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany 
(FRG,  or  West  Germany)  in  1990,  tend  to  be  overrepresented 
in  each  of  these  groups. 

Women  are  more  at  a  disadvantage  than  any  other  social 
group.  This  fact  stems  from  the  bias  of  German  social  insur- 
ance programs  in  favor  of  a  male  breadwinner  model;  most 
women  receive  social  and  health  protection  by  virtue  of  their 
dependent  status  as  spouse.  Hence,  despite  the  existence  of  a 
comprehensive  interlocking  social  net,  women  face  inequali- 
ties in  accruing  benefits  in  their  own  right  because  of  periods 
spent  rearing  children  or  caring  for  an  elderly  parent. 
Divorced  women  also  fare  poorly  because  of  the  welfare  sys- 
tem's provisions,  as  do  widows,  whose  pensions  are  low. 

In  addition  to  these  problems  or  shortcomings,  Germany's 
social  welfare  and  health  programs  have  had  to  contend  with 
the  unification  of  the  former  West  Germany  and  East  Germany 
in  1990.  West  Germany's  approach  to  social  insurance,  health 
insurance,  unemployment  insurance  (which  did  not  exist  in 
the  former  GDR),  accident  insurance,  and  social  aid  and  assis- 
tance has  been  applied  to  East  Germany.  This  fact  has  meant 
that  the  complex  and  heterogeneous  organizational  and  finan- 
cial arrangements  present  in  the  former  West  Germany  to 
deliver  health  and  social  services  have  had  to  be  built  up  in  the 
former  East  Germany,  in  many  cases  entirely  from  scratch. 

The  need  for  this  extension  of  social  welfare  programs  fol- 
lows logically  from  the  former  East  Germany's  transition  to  a 
free-market  economy  in  which  employment,  health  care,  and 
social  insurance  benefits  have  always  been  highly  contingent 
upon  each  other.  In  the  absence  of  an  East  German  democratic 
tradition  and  attitudes  supportive  of  the  new  institutions  and, 
as  well,  of  adequate  private  organizational  resources  and  skilled 
manpower,  Germany's  attempt  to  integrate  two  entirely  differ- 
ent systems  of  social  protection,  education,  and  health  care 


196 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

purely  by  means  of  law,  administrative  provisions,  and  financial 
resources  is  bound  to  produce  problems  for  years  to  come. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  representatives  of  Germany's  political  par- 
ties, businesses,  unions,  and  voluntary  social  services  agencies 
continued  to  wage  a  vigorous  debate  over  social  policy.  At  issue 
is  the  role  to  be  played  by  state  and/or  nongovernmental  vol- 
untary charitable  agencies,  churches,  and  other  social  service 
providers  and  how  to  find  a  politically  acceptable  mix  of  public 
and  private  institutions.  Ever  since  the  nineteenth  century, 
especially  during  periods  of  economic  and  social  crisis,  there 
has  been  a  recurrent  demand  to  shift  from  insurance-based 
programs  to  a  universal  flat-rate  and  tax-financed  program  in 
order  to  secure  a  minimum  income  for  all.  However,  there  has 
never  been  sufficient  political  support  for  eliminating  insur- 
ance-based programs.  In  the  postwar  period,  business  groups 
and  the  Christian  Democratic  Union  (Christlich  Demo- 
kratische  Union — CDU),  with  the  exception  of  the  left  wing 
within  the  CDU,  tended  to  support  the  continued  segmenta- 
tion of  the  labor  force  into  separate  insurance-based  programs 
for  various  occupational  groups.  In  contrast,  the  labor  unions 
and  the  Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialdemo- 
kratische  Partei  Deutschlands — SPD)  tended  to  support  uni- 
tary programs  for  the  entire  labor  force. 

The  great  costs  of  unification  have  raised  the  possibility  of 
ending  the  steady  expansion  of  social  welfare  programs  that 
had  been  going  on  for  more  than  a  century.  The  current  con- 
servative governing  coalition  has  proposed  reductions  in  bene- 
fits to  finance  unification.  Other  factors  such  as  the 
increasingly  competitive  global  economy  and  structural 
changes  in  the  labor  market  have  also  raised  questions  about 
the  continued  affordability  of  German  social  policy.  As  a  result, 
the  government  is  increasingly  listening  to  employers  who 
insist  that  their  share  of  employee  benefit  payments  be 
reduced  in  order  that  German  business  remain  competitive  in 
a  global  economy. 

The  integration  of  the  two  entirely  different  education  sys- 
tems that  emerged  after  the  1945  division  of  the  country  has 
also  raised  many  controversial  issues.  No  consensus  has 
emerged  on  whether  Germany  should  adopt  the  unified  school 
system  found  in  the  former  East  Germany  or  the  heteroge- 
neous three-tiered  system  of  the  former  West  Germany.  Nor  is 
there  consensus  on  whether  to  increase  the  number  of  school 
years  by  one  year  for  students  in  eastern  Germany  or  to  reduce 


197 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  thirteen  years  of  schooling  in  western  Germany  to  twelve 
years.  A  greater  uniformity  within  the  country's  education  sys- 
tem is  also  needed  because  the  plethora  of  school  tracks  and 
the  diversity  of  curricula  and  qualifying  examinations  might 
indeed  endanger  the  mobility  of  students  and  teachers  within 
Germany  and  within  Europe  in  general. 

Social  Insurance  and  Welfare  Programs 

Historical  Development 

After  Germany  was  united  in  1871  under  the  direction  of 
Otto  von  Bismarck,  the  nation  developed  a  common  govern- 
ment structure  and  social  policy.  But  the  fact  that  united  Ger- 
many had  been  formed  out  of  four  kingdoms,  five  grand 
duchies,  twelve  duchies,  twelve  principalities,  and  three  free  cit- 
ies was  a  crucial  factor  in  the  way  social  welfare  was  adminis- 
trated. Although  after  unification  social  welfare  policy  was 
increasingly  formulated  on  the  national  level,  the  social  insur- 
ance programs  implementing  national  policy  were  aimed  at 
different  social  strata  and  were  administered  in  highly  decen- 
tralized ways. 

The  new  social  welfare  system  that  developed  after  unifica- 
tion in  1871  used  existing  decentralized  structures  to  provide 
an  ever  increasing  range  of  benefits.  Because  of  this,  most 
social  welfare  programs  in  Germany  are  not  administered  by 
state  bureaucracies.  Instead,  except  for  the  period  when  Ger- 
many was  ruled  by  the  regime  of  Adolf  Hitler  (1933-45)  and 
when  the  former  East  Germany  (1949-90)  established  a  state- 
run  social  welfare  program,  the  organizations  implementing 
social  policy  have  been  private  voluntary  entities,  some  of 
which  date  from  the  Middle  Ages.  Thus,  Germany  has  imple- 
mented a  national  social  policy  through  an  extensive  decentral- 
ized and  pluralistic  network  of  voluntary  agencies. 

Germans  see  their  economy  as  a  social  market  economy,  that 
is,  one  that  combines  a  capitalist  mode  of  production  with  the 
belief  that  society  should  protect  all  its  members  from  eco- 
nomic and  social  need.  Such  protection  is  provided  by  a  system 
of  social  insurance  to  which  people  contribute  according  to 
their  incomes  with  the  understanding  that  they  may  someday 
need  its  assistance.  The  belief  that  society  is  responsible  for  the 
well-being  of  its  members  is  called  solidarity,  or  Solidaritat,  and 
is  a  key  concept  of  German  social  policy. 


198 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

Germans  have  combined  the  notion  of  solidarity  with  fed- 
eral and  decentralized  arrangements  of  power  sharing,  or  Sub- 
sidaritdt,  another  concept  that  lies  at  the  heart  of  German 
political  culture  and  is  characteristic  of  all  German-speaking 
countries.  Fundamentally,  Subsidaritdt  means  building  social 
organizations  and  society  from  the  bottom  up  rather  than  from 
the  top  down.  As  a  result  of  this  concept,  Germans  rely  on 
grassroots  social  entities  whenever  possible  to  provide  social 
services  and  make  use  of  higher-level  institutions  only  when 
lower-level  ones  are  found  to  be  inadequate. 

Solidaritdt  and  Subsidaritdt  have  affected  the  development  of 
a  national  social  policy,  but  most  of  all  they  have  shaped  its 
implementation.  For  example,  Germany's  social  insurance  pro- 
grams are  quasi-public  self-governing  bodies  subject  in  most 
cases  to  labor  and  management  control,  but  they  are  largely 
independent  of  the  public  sector,  which  retains  only  supervi- 
sory powers.  The  primary  providers  of  most  social  assistance 
services  are  private-sector  voluntary  organizations,  most  of 
which  are  church  related.  Government  offices  at  the  regional 
and  local  levels  generally  determine  and  handle  cash  benefits 
and  allowances  established  at  the  national  level. 

Some  of  the  most  important  voluntary  social  service  agen- 
cies and  church-related  groups  predate  the  unification  of  Ger- 
many in  1871;  others  date  from  the  last  decades  of  the 
nineteenth  century.  The  first  German  chapter  of  the  Interna- 
tional Red  Cross  was  founded  in  1863.  Out  of  it  grew  the  Ger- 
man Red  Cross,  one  of  the  country's  key  voluntary  agencies. 
The  Innere  Mission,  which  later  became  the  Diakonisches 
Werk  of  the  Evangelical  Church  in  Germany,  was  founded  in 
1848.  The  Roman  Catholic  charity  Deutscher  Caritasverband, 
the  largest  of  the  voluntary  welfare  associations,  dates  from 
1897.  The  German  Non-Denominational  Welfare  Association, 
as  it  became  known  after  1932,  was  founded  in  1920  to  repre- 
sent all  nonchurch-related  hospitals.  The  Workers'  Welfare 
Organization  was  founded  in  1919  from  numerous  Social  Dem- 
ocratic women's  groups  working  for  the  well-being  of  children. 

Despite  the  radically  different  political  regimes  in  power  in 
Germany  since  1871,  German  social  policy  has  shown  a  remark- 
able degree  of  continuity  in  organizational  arrangements  and 
financing.  Change  has  been  largely  of  an  incremental  nature, 
and  new  programs  have  conformed  to  previously  existing  prin- 
ciples and  patterns.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

The  beginning  of  the  national  German  social  welfare  system 
occurred  in  the  1880s  while  Bismarck  was  in  power.  A  primary 
motivation  for  social  legislation  was  the  government's  desire  to 
erode  support  for  socialism  among  workers  and  to  establish  the 
superiority  of  the  Prussian  state  over  the  churches.  The  govern- 
ment hoped  that  provision  of  economic  security  in  case  of 
major  risks  and  loss  of  income  would  promote  political  integra- 
tion and  political  stability.  Three  laws  laid  the  foundations  of 
the  German  social  welfare  system:  the  Health  Insurance  of 
Workers  Law  of  1883,  which  provided  protection  against  the 
temporary  loss  of  income  as  a  result  of  illness;  the  Accident 
Insurance  Law  of  1884,  which  aided  workers  injured  on  the 
job;  and  the  Old  Age  and  Invalidity  Insurance  Law  of  1889.  Ini- 
tially, these  three  laws  covered  only  the  top  segments  of  the 
blue-collar  working  class. 

The  second  phase  of  the  German  social  welfare  system 
spanned  the  period  from  1890,  the  year  of  Bismarck's  resigna- 
tion, to  1918.  During  this  period,  improvements  were  made  in 
the  initial  programs.The  National  Insurance  Code  of  1911  inte- 
grated the  three  separate  insurance  programs  into  a  unified 
social  security  system,  and  compulsory  coverage  and  benefits 
were  extended  to  white-collar  workers.  Survivors'  pensions  for 
widows  were  also  introduced  in  1911.  (The  many  amendments 
to  the  National  Insurance  Code  of  1911  were  later  integrated 
into  the  Social  Insurance  Code  of  1988.)  In  1916  survivors' 
benefits  were  increased,  and  the  retirement  age  for  workers 
was  reduced  from  seventy  to  sixty-five.  Because  its  cooperation 
was  needed  to  maintain  production  during  World  War  I,  the 
working  class  acquired  more  political  influence  and  won 
greater  social  protection  and  representation  during  this 
period.  Efforts  were  also  made  to  develop  mechanisms  for  set- 
tling labor  disputes  and  organizing  voluntary  employee  com- 
mittees, issues  taken  up  by  new  labor  legislation  and  decrees. 
Most  efforts  were  completed  by  the  mid-1920s. 

The  Weimar  Republic  (1918-33)  saw  a  further  expansion  of 
social  welfare  programs.  In  1920  war  victims'  benefits  were 
added  to  the  social  welfare  system.  In  1922  the  Youth  Welfare 
Act  was  passed,  which  today  continues  to  serve  as  the  basic 
vehicle  for  all  youth-related  programs.  Unemployment  relief 
was  consolidated  in  1923  into  a  regular  assistance  program, 
financed  by  employees  and  employers.  The  same  year,  the  1913 
agreement  between  doctors  and  sickness  funds  about  who 
could  treat  sickness-funds  patients  was  integrated  into  the 


200 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

National  Insurance  Code.  Also  in  1923,  a  national  law  on  min- 
ers created  a  single  agency  for  the  administration  of  social 
insurance  programs  for  miners;  before  the  law  went  into  effect, 
110  separate  associations  had  administered  the  program.  In 
1924  a  modern  public  assistance  program  replaced  the  poor 
relief  legislation  of  1870,  and  in  1925  the  accident  insurance 
program  was  reformed,  allowing  occupational  diseases  to 
become  insurable  risks.  In  1927  a  national  unemployment 
insurance  program  was  also  established.  These  gains  in  social 
insurance  and  assistance  programs  were  threatened  by  the 
Great  Depression  of  the  early  1930s,  however.  Reduced  wages 
meant  smaller  contributions  to  social  insurance  and  assistance 
programs,  all  of  which  were  soon  on  the  brink  of  bankruptcy. 

The  Hitler  regime  introduced  major  changes  in  individual 
programs  and  program  administration.  In  1934  the  regime  dis- 
mantled the  self-governance  structure  of  all  social  insurance 
programs  and  appointed  directors  who  reported  to  the  central 
authorities.  The  regime  made  many  improvements  in  social 
insurance  programs  and  benefits,  but  these  changes  were  con- 
ceived to  serve  the  regime  rather  than  the  population.  In  1938 
artisans  came  to  be  covered  under  compulsory  social  insur- 
ance, and  in  1941  public  health  insurance  coverage  was 
extended  to  pensioners.  In  1942  all  wage-earners  regardless  of 
occupation  were  covered  by  accident  insurance,  health  care 
became  unlimited,  and  maternity  leave  was  extended  to  twelve 
fully  paid  weeks  with  job  protection. 

Two  separate  German  states  evolved  after  World  War  II,  each 
with  its  own  social  welfare  programs.  In  the  GDR,  the  state 
became  even  stronger  than  it  had  been  under  Hitler.  The  com- 
munist-directed Socialist  Unity  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialis- 
tische  Einheitspartei  Deutschlands — SED)  had  a  near 
monopoly  of  control  over  all  social  and  political  institutions, 
including  those  that  administered  social  welfare  programs. 

Initially,  the  GDR  retained  separate  social  insurance  plans, 
but  by  1956  the  plans  had  been  unified  into  two  compulsory, 
centrally  controlled,  and  hierarchically  organized  systems  that 
provided  universal  flat-rate  benefits.  Special  programs  also 
served  the  so-called  technical  and  scientific  intelligentsia,  civil 
servants,  police,  and  members  of  the  National  People's  Army 
(Nationale  Volksarmee — NVA)  and  other  security  organiza- 
tions. All  programs  were  heavily  state  subsidized,  unlike  those 
in  West  Germany.  Because  the  right  to  work  was  guaranteed, 
unemployment  insurance  did  not  exist.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

West  Germany  moved  away  from  Hitler's  central  state  direc- 
tion and  returned  to  decentralized  administration  and  control. 
Social  insurance  and  social  protection  programs  under  labor 
and  management  control,  which  were  characteristic  of  the 
Weimar  period,  were  restored.  The  return  to  separate  earn- 
ings-related and  means-tested  benefits  for  different  groups 
meant  that  social  insurance,  social  compensation,  and  public 
assistance  (or  social  aid)  were  not  integrated  into  one  overall 
administration,  as  some  Germans  wished  and  as  the  Allied 
Control  Council  had  intended  in  1946  when  it  drafted  a  uni- 
fied national  insurance  system.  In  the  mid-1970s,  legislators 
attempted  to  consolidate  the  goals,  the  protection,  and  the 
entitlements  as  much  as  possible.  But  they  failed  to  develop  a 
coherently  organized  and  uniform  system  that  would  have 
eliminated  disparities  in  individual  entitlements.  Indeed,  by 
the  mid-1990s  the  disparities  in  welfare  benefits  entitlements  in 
unified  Germany  had  become  more  significant  than  ever 
before. 

Provisions  of  the  Social  Welfare  System 

The  German  social  welfare  tradition  divides  entitlement  pro- 
grams into  three  types.  The  first  and  most  common  type  con- 
sists of  contributory  social  insurance  programs  that  protect 
those  who  pay  into  them  from  loss  of  income  and  unplanned 
expenditures  because  of  illness,  accident,  old  age  or  disability, 
and  unemployment.  The  second  type  consists  of  noncontribu- 
tory  social  compensation  programs  that  provide  tax-financed 
social  welfare  (such  as  health  care,  pensions,  and  other  bene- 
fits) to  those — civil  servants,  for  example — who  perform  a  pub- 
lic service  to  society.  Tax-financed  social  compensation  is  also 
provided  to  those  who  have  suffered  from  income  loss  or  dis- 
ability as  a  result  of  military  or  other  public  service,  and  allow- 
ances are  provided  to  their  dependents  in  the  case  of  death. 
Since  1976  victims  of  violent  crimes  have  also  been  eligible  for 
social  compensation.  In  addition,  social  compensation  can  con- 
sist of  payments  to  all  members  of  society  and  includes  tax- 
funded  child,  housing,  and  educational  allowances.  The  third 
type  of  social  welfare  programs  provides  social  aid,  or  assis- 
tance, to  persons  in  need  who  are  not  eligible  for  assistance 
from  the  other  two  kinds  of  social  entitlement  programs  or 
who  need  additional  aid  because  they  are  still  in  need — for 
example,  if  their  pensions  are  too  small  to  provide  them  with 
decent  housing.  Aid  can  consist  of  general  income  mainte-

nance  payments  (including  payments  for  food,  housing,  cloth- 
ing, and  furniture)  and  assistance  for  those  with  special  needs, 
such  as  the  disabled,  and  individuals  without  health  insurance 
(0.3  percent  of  the  total  German  population). 

In  order  to  better  measure  the  extent  of  social  welfare 
expenditures,  since  1960  the  Germans  have  used  the  concept 
of  a  social  budget  to  lump  together  all  forms  of  social  spend- 
ing, whether  by  the  government,  by  the  country's  large  social 
insurance  programs,  or  by  other  sources.  The  steady  expansion 
of  social  welfare  programs  and  the  increased  costs  of  such 
items  as  pensions  and  medical  care  caused  West  Germany's 
social  budget  to  increase  tenfold  between  1960  and  1990,  from 
DM68.9  billion  in  1960  to  DM703.1  billion  in  1990.  The  West 
German  economy  expanded  greatly  in  this  period  so  that  the 
social  budget's  share  of  GNP  increased  from  about  one-fifth  in 
1960  to  about  one-third  by  1990.  Roughly  two-fifths  of  the  1990 
social  budget  went  to  pension  payments  and  one-third  to 
health  care.  By  1992  the  social  budget  had  grown  to  about 
DM900  billion,  a  sharp  increase  caused  by  the  unification  of 
the  two  Germanys.  Unification  meant  an  increased  population 
and  many  special  needs  of  the  five  new  states  (Lander,  sing., 
Land)  in  eastern  Germany. 

In  1990  the  public  sector  (federal,  Land,  and  local  govern- 
ments) paid  for  about  38  percent  of  the  social  budget,  employ- 
ers for  32  percent,  and  private  households  for  about  29 
percent.  The  remainder  was  financed  by  social  insurance  and 
private  organizations. 

The  cost  of  the  social  budget  for  an  average  wage  earner  is 
difficult  to  assess.  By  the  mid-1990s,  however,  a  typical  wage 
earner  was  estimated  to  pay  about  one-fifth  of  his  or  her 
income  in  direct  taxes  (only  part  of  which  went  to  the  social 
budget)  and  another  one-fifth  for  the  compulsory  social  insur- 
ance programs.  In  addition,  there  were  many  indirect  taxes, 
which  accounted  for  about  two-fifths  of  all  tax  revenue.  The 
most  important  of  the  indirect  taxes  is  the  value-added  tax 
(VAT — see  Glossary),  set  in  1993  at  15  percent  for  most  goods 
and  at  7  percent  for  basic  commodities  each  time  it  is  assessed. 
Given  Germany's  demographic  trends,  the  cost  of  the  social 
budget  is  certain  to  increase  in  the  coming  decades. 

Social  Insurance 

The  social  insurance  program  was  established  in  1889  and 
provides  retirement  pay.  Although  the  central  government  has 


203 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

always  formulated  social  insurance  policy,  the  implementation 
of  the  program  is  decentralized.  In  unified  Germany,  control 
over  the  blue-collar  insurance  programs  remains  in  the  hands 
of  twenty-three  Land-based  insurance  agencies  and  four  federal 
insurance  agencies.  In  the  old  Lander  in  western  Germany, 
eighteen  Land-based  insurance  agencies  serve  people  in  geo- 
graphical districts  that  conform  to  those  established  in  the 
nineteenth  century,  not  to  the  geographical  entities  created 
after  1945.  With  the  assistance  of  staff  from  the  West  German 
insurance  agencies,  five  Land-based  and  self-governing  insur- 
ance agencies  were  established  in  the  new  Lander. 

Four  federal  insurance  agencies  serve  four  groups  in  unified 
Germany:  federal  railroad  workers,  merchant  marine  seamen, 
miners,  and  white-collar  workers.  Civil  servants  and  their 
dependents  are  covered  by  a  separate  retirement  program 
financed  by  outlays  from  federal,  Land,  and  local  governments. 
Other  retirement  programs  provide  retirement  income  for  reg- 
istered craftsmen,  agricultural  workers,  and  self-employed  pro- 
fessionals. 

Because  of  population  trends  that  indicate  a  worsening 
worker/retiree  ratio  and  the  likelihood  of  solvency  problems 
in  the  next  century,  the  pension  reform  of  1992  increased  the 
usual  retirement  age  from  sixty-three  to  sixty-five,  beginning  in 
2001.  Whatever  the  legal  retirement  age,  many  Germans  retire 
early  for  health  reasons  on  disability  pensions. 

The  amount  of  retirement  pay  is  determined  by  the  length 
and  level  of  the  insured  person's  contributions.  Contributions 
in  1995  were  scheduled  to  amount  to  18.6  percent  of  an 
employee's  annual  gross  income  up  to  a  maximum  of 
DM93,600  in  the  old  Lander  and  DM76,800  in  the  new  Lander, 
with  the  employee  and  employer  each  paying  half.  In  the  early 
1990s,  the  average  retirement  pension  amounted  to  about 
DM1,600  per  month  for  retired  persons  over  the  age  of  sixty. 
This  meant  that  Germany  had  the  fourth-highest  pensions  in 
Europe,  surpassed  only  by  Luxemburg,  France,  and  Denmark. 
In  1957  legislation  was  passed  that  required  pensions  to  be 
indexed,  that  is,  raised  according  to  average  wage  increases. 

Unemployment  Insurance 

Unemployment  insurance  was  introduced  in  1927,  relatively 
late  in  comparison  with  the  pioneering  programs  of  the  nine- 
teenth century.  It  replaced  the  welfare  program  for  the  unem- 
ployed that  had  been  created  in  1919.  With  the  exception  of

205 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

civil  servants,  all  employed  individuals  and  trainees,  irrespec- 
tive of  salary  or  wage  levels,  are  covered  by  the  program.  Con- 
tributions in  1995  to  unemployment  insurance  were  scheduled 
to  amount  to  6.5  percent  of  an  employee's  gross  pay  up  to 
DM96,600  in  the  old  Lander  and  DM76,800  in  the  new  Lander, 
with  the  employee  and  employer  each  paying  half.  In  return, 
the  employee  receives  unemployment  pay  of  68  percent  of  net 
earnings  for  a  married  worker  and  63  percent  for  a  nonmar- 
ried  worker,  provided  that  the  unemployed  person  has  worked 
for  360  insurable  days  in  the  last  three  years  before  being  laid 
off.  Unemployment  pay  can  be  paid  from  the  first  day  of  unem- 
ployment for  seventy-eight  to  832  weekdays,  depending  on  the 
length  of  insured  employment  and  the  age  of  the  unemployed. 
In  the  early  1990s,  unemployment  pay  averaged  DM1,300  per 
month.  Once  unemployment  pay  runs  out,  the  employee  is  eli- 
gible for  unemployment  aid,  which  averaged  DM975  a  month 
in  the  early  1990s.  Because  the  unemployed  frequently  do  not 
receive  enough  benefits  to  maintain  their  basic  living  standard, 
local  social  welfare  entities  often  provide  additional  assistance. 
During  unemployment,  entitlements  to  benefits  of  other  social 
insurance  and  health  insurance  programs  remain  in  place. 

The  unemployment  insurance  program  is  administered 
through  a  three-tiered  administration:  a  federal  labor  agency, 
regional  labor  agencies  in  the  Lander,  and  local  labor  offices. 
Unlike  the  labor-management  partnership  in  the  administra- 
tion of  the  other  insurance  programs,  this  program  is  con- 
trolled by  tripartite  boards  composed  of  representatives  of 
labor,  management,  and  governments  at  the  federal,  Land,  and 
local  level.  Because  East  Germany  did  not  have  an  unemploy- 
ment insurance  program,  the  adoption  of  such  a  program  in 
the  new  Lander  has  entailed  numerous  administrative  prob- 
lems. In  addition,  unemployment  there  is  higher  than  in  the 
old  Lander  (in  1994  about  15  percent,  compared  with  10  per- 
cent in  the  old  Lander) . 

Accident  Insurance 

Enacted  in  1884,  the  accident  insurance  program  initially 
covered  only  accidents  in  the  workplace.  In  1925  occupational 
diseases  also  came  to  be  covered.  In  the  post-1945  era,  cash  and 
in-kind  benefits  such  as  rehabilitation  and  vocational  training 
were  expanded  and  improved.  Travel  to  and  from  work  is  also 
now  covered.  If  an  accident  leads  to  total  disability,  the  injured 
person  receives  a  pension  amounting  to  66  percent  of  the  latest 


206 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

year's  earnings.  Survivor  pensions  can  amount  to  a  maximum 
of  80  percent  of  earnings.  Disability  pensions  and  survivors' 
benefits  were  indexed  in  1957,  that  is,  adjusted  according  to 
wage  increases.  In  addition  to  covering  members  of  the  labor 
force,  the  plan  also  covers  students  and  children;  their  cover- 
age is  paid  for  out  of  general  tax  revenues.  Employers  pay  pre- 
miums for  their  employees;  premiums  amount  to  1.44  percent 
of  an  employee's  gross  earnings.  The  self-employed  are  also 
able  to  enroll  in  the  program. 

Social  Assistance 

Social  assistance  is  provided  to  persons  who,  for  any  of  a 
number  of  reasons,  are  unable  to  provide  themselves  with  a 
decent  standard  of  living.  In  1991  some  4.2  million  persons 
received  various  forms  of  social  assistance.  In  the  same  year,  the 
most  important  reasons  that  people  needed  social  assistance 
were  unemployment  (34  percent;  social  assistance  is  paid  once 
unemployment  pay  runs  out),  pensions  or  incomes  too  small  to 
allow  their  recipients  a  decent  standard  of  living  (11  and  7  per- 
cent, respectively),  refusal  of  divorced  fathers  to  pay  child  sup- 
port (11  percent),  and  sickness  (6  percent).  Half  of  all 
recipients  of  social  assistance  are  single  elderly  women.  For- 
eigners residing  in  Germany  also  receive  social  assistance  at  a 
higher  than  average  rate  because  they  are  more  likely  to  be 
unemployed  or  earn  low  incomes. 

Unlike  the  benefits  provided  by  social  insurance  programs, 
social  assistance  is  funded  by  taxes  and  is  not  determined  by 
previous  contributions.  Social  assistance  is  means  tested,  and 
recipients  generally  must  have  exhausted  their  savings.  The 
incomes  of  a  recipient's  close  relatives  (parents  and  children) 
may  also  be  considered  when  assessing  the  provision  of  social 
assistance.  In  the  mid-1990s,  social  assistance  for  the  head  of 
household  amounted  to  about  DM500  a  month  in  the  old 
Lander,  80  percent  of  this  amount  was  allocated  for  the  spouse, 
and  50  to  90  percent  of  this  amount  was  allocated  for  the  chil- 
dren, depending  on  their  ages.  In  addition  to  these  benefits, 
social  assistance  can  cover  housing  costs,  medical  care,  cloth- 
ing, winter  heating,  and  many  other  expenses. 

Other  Social  Benefits 

In  addition  to  social  assistance,  Germany's  social  welfare  sys- 
tem provides  many  other  tax-funded  benefits.  The  most  widely 
paid  benefit  is  that  of  the  child  allowance.  It  is  paid  to  parents 


207 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

of  all  income  levels  to  lessen  the  burden  of  raising  children. 
Benefits  are  generally  paid  until  the  child  reaches  the  age  of 
sixteen  and  thereafter  up  to  the  age  of  twenty-seven  if  the  child 
is  receiving  an  education.  In  the  mid-1990s,  DM70  a  month  was 
paid  for  the  first  child,  DM130  for  the  second,  DM220  for  the 
third,  and  DM240  for  the  fourth  and  subsequent  children. 
Upper-income  parents  receive  smaller  amounts.  Child  benefits 
are  tax  exempt.  Taxpayers  also  have  an  annual  income  tax 
exemption  of  DM4,104  for  each  dependent  child. 

Since  1986  payments  for  child  rearing  have  also  been  made 
to  parents  who  are  either  unemployed  or  working  only  up  to 
nineteen  hours  per  week.  In  1994  these  payments  amounted  to 
DM600  a  month  per  child  for  the  first  six  months  of  the  child's 
life;  after  this  age,  household  income  was  considered.  Pay- 
ments continue  until  the  child's  second  birthday.  Beginning  in 
1994,  a  single  parent  with  a  net  annual  income  of  more  than 
DM75,000  and  a  couple  with  a  net  annual  income  of  more  than 
DM100,000  were  no  longer  eligible  to  receive  this  benefit. 

A  single  parent  raising  a  child  and  receiving  inadequate 
financial  support  from  the  other  parent  is  eligible  to  receive 
maintenance  payments  up  to  a  child's  twelfth  birthday  for  a 
maximum  period  of  seventy-two  months.  In  1994  in  the  old 
Lander,  these  payments  could  amount  to  as  much  as  DM291  a 
month  for  children  up  to  age  six  and  DM353  a  month  for  chil- 
dren between  the  ages  of  six  and  twelve. 

Families  and  single  individuals  can  also  receive  payments  to 
help  them  with  housing  expenses  if  their  incomes  are  insuffi- 
cient to  afford  decent  shelter.  Unlike  housing  aid  provided 
through  social  assistance,  aid  of  this  nature  does  not  require 
that  recipients  exhaust  their  savings  or  lack  close  relatives  to 
assist  them. 

The  disabled  are  also  served  by  a  broad  range  of  medical 
and  vocational  programs  designed  to  provide  them  with 
humane  living  conditions.  Statutory  social  insurance  programs 
are  responsible  for  meeting  the  various  needs  of  their  mem- 
bers who  become  disabled.  In  addition,  government  agencies 
at  the  federal,  Land,  and  local  levels  seek  to  provide  employ- 
ment and  help  with  special  housing  and  transportation  provi- 
sions. Employment  of  the  disabled  is  furthered  by  federal 
legislation  that  requires  firms  employing  more  than  fifteen  per- 
sons to  reserve  6  percent  of  positions  for  the  disabled  or  to 
make  annual  compensatory  payments.  In  1994  Germany  had 
nearly  600  sheltered  workplaces  able  to  provide  special  employ- 


208 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

ment  for  about  140,000  disabled  persons  unable  to  find 
employment  in  the  general  economy. 

Since  1995  German  residents  have  been  obliged  to  join  a 
new  social  insurance  program  that  arranges  for  its  members' 
future  need  for  long-term  nursing  care.  Those  with  public 
health  insurance  will  continue  with  that  insurance;  those  with 
private  health  insurance  are  obliged  to  secure  a  new  insurance 
policy  to  arrange  long-term  nursing  care.  The  new  insurance 
program  will  initially  cover  the  expenses  of  long-term  nursing 
provided  at  home;  monthly  benefits,  in  some  special  cases,  will 
go  up  to  DM3,750  but  usually  will  be  set  at  much  lower  levels 
depending  on  the  kind  of  nursing  care  provided  and  the  con- 
dition of  the  insured  person's  health.  Some  benefits  will  be  pro- 
vided in  kind,  such  as  visits  by  health  care  professionals  to  the 
home.  Some  benefits  will  be  cash  payments  to  friends  or  rela- 
tives who  provide  nonprofessional  nursing  care.  Beginning  in 
mid-1996,  long-term  institutional  care  will  also  be  covered. 

Until  this  program  was  instituted,  the  lack  of  long-term  nurs- 
ing care  was  seen  as  the  single  most  important  shortcoming  in 
the  country's  system  of  social  welfare.  One  effect  of  this  short- 
coming was  that  patients  who  should  have  been  receiving  nurs- 
ing care  at  home  or  in  a  nursing  institution  remained  instead 
in  hospitals,  a  more  expensive  form  of  treatment.  As  of  late 
1994,  officials  had  set  an  initial  contribution  of  1  percent  of 
incomes  up  to  DM68,400  a  year  in  the  old  Lander  and 
DM53,100  in  the  new  Lander,  with  the  employee  and  the 
employer  each  paying  half.  Part  of  the  costs  of  long-term  nurs- 
ing care  may  in  the  future  be  covered  by  abolishing  a  public 
holiday  that  always  falls  on  a  workday.  To  cover  the  cost  of  long- 
term  institutional  nursing  care,  the  contribution  rate  will 
increase  to  1.7  percent  in  mid-1996.  The  great  expense  of  this 
benefit  may  require  the  abolition  of  a  second  public  holiday. 

The  administration  of  the  nursing  care  insurance  program  is 
unique.  It  overlaps  somewhat  that  of  the  sickness  funds  but  will 
also  include  many  federal,  Land,  and  local  agencies.  In  fact,  the 
program  will  involve  more  implementors  than  all  other  social 
insurance  programs  combined.  Implementation  problems 
arise  primarily  from  different  entitlements  and  services  pro- 
vided through  social  assistance,  or  social  aid,  and  by  nursing 
care  insurance.  Problems  also  stem  from  differing  evaluations 
by  sickness-funds  medical  experts  about  who  needs  care  and 
how  much  and  what  kind  of  nursing  care  is  needed  throughout 
Germany.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Current  Social  Welfare  Issues  and  Outlook  for  the  Future 

As  of  mid-1995,  the  policy  and  institutional  features  that 
characterized  the  development  of  German  social  policy  over 
the  last  century  continued  to  provide  the  overall  umbrella  of 
social  policy  in  Germany.  This  has  meant  the  continuation  of 
separate  programs  for  different  groups  in  the  labor  force; 
decentralized  and  mostly  nongovernment,  self-administering 
bodies  and  private  grassroots  voluntary  social  welfare  agencies; 
an  emphasis  on  earnings-related  individualized  cash  benefits 
determined  by  past  contributions  rather  than  by  need;  and  a 
continued  reliance  on  social  insurance  programs.  For  most 
people  living  in  Germany,  these  programs  have  worked  well 
and  in  the  postwar  period  have  provided  a  continuous  expan- 
sion of  coverage  and  improved  benefits. 

Behind  these  achievements,  however,  are  hidden  inequities 
and  inequalities.  During  the  last  forty  years,  the  system  favored 
the  improvement  of  benefits  for  those  with  a  continuous  work 
record.  For  the  most  part,  these  were  male  workers  and  women 
who  had  never  left  the  workforce.  They  received  earnings- 
related  insurance  benefits  while  other  population  groups 
tended  to  receive  means-tested  benefits  or  a  combination  of 
the  two. 

The  number  of  individuals  receiving  means-tested  social 
assistance,  however,  was  increasing  in  the  former  FRG  even 
prior  to  unification.  And  in  1995,  in  a  united  Germany,  the 
recipients  of  social  assistance  included  a  growing  number  of 
impoverished  elderly  women,  female-headed  single  house- 
holds, and  families  with  several  children.  For  example,  a  1992 
study  found  that  households  with  a  sick  or  disabled  person 
needing  constant  home  care,  households  with  a  newborn 
child,  and  non-German  households  had  an  increased  likeli- 
hood of  receiving  social  assistance  benefits. 

Women  are  more  heavily  represented  among  the  disadvan- 
taged than  men.  Their  lower  wages  on  average  mean  smaller 
benefits  because  of  smaller  contributions  into  insurance  pro- 
grams. In  addition,  the  time  women  spend  caring  for  children 
and  other  relatives  generally  means  that  women  have  shorter 
work  histories,  which  affects  their  pension  levels.  German  wel- 
fare regulations  also  place  divorced  and  separated  women  at  a 
disadvantage. 

The  new  Lander  present  a  challenge  to  Germany's  social  wel- 
fare system.  From  the  perspective  of  individuals,  unification 
brought  a  number  of  social  and  institutional  innovations  and 


210 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

improvements  in  living  conditions,  along  with  a  few  new  enti- 
tlements— for  example,  disability  pay,  retirement  for  men 
under  the  age  of  sixty-five,  and  pensions  for  widows  and  widow- 
ers. However,  the  abolition  of  familiar  social  service  centers, 
child-care  facilities,  and  nursing  homes,  coupled  with  inexperi- 
enced staff  in  administrative  agencies,  has  increased  social  and 
psychological  stress  for  many  in  the  east.  Women  of  child-bear- 
ing age  living  in  the  new  Lander  have  been  particularly  affected 
because  before  unification  they  had  better  prenatal  and  post- 
natal care,  the  right  to  abortion,  and  a  fairly  widespread  net- 
work of  day-care  centers  at  work  or  in  their  communities. 

The  lack  of  private  voluntary  organizations  in  the  new 
Lander  has  made  the  administration  of  social  programs  there 
difficult.  Western  German  voluntary  and  church-related  agen- 
cies have  provided  and  still  do  provide  much  assistance.  They 
have  also  assisted  in  setting  up  local  and  district  government 
offices  and  have  trained  new  manpower  to  decide  on  entitle- 
ments, calculate  benefits,  and  interpret  new  laws.  But  a  serious 
shortage  of  social  workers  and  facilities  to  train  or  retrain  them 
remains. 

The  difference  between  the  two  Germanys  in  terms  of  bene- 
fits received  and  resources  available  for  different  social  strata 
will  continue  for  some  time.  The  resulting  dissatisfaction  and 
social  decline  can  be  considered  time  bombs  that  might  bring 
future  political,  social,  and  psychological  instability. 

National  Health  Insurance  and  Medical  Care 

Germany's  health  care  system  provides  its  residents  with 
nearly  universal  access  to  comprehensive  high-quality  medical 
care  and  a  choice  of  physicians.  Over  90  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion receives  health  care  through  the  country's  statutory  health 
care  insurance  program.  Membership  in  this  program  is  com- 
pulsory for  all  those  earning  less  than  a  periodically  revised 
income  ceiling.  Nearly  all  of  the  remainder  of  the  population 
receives  health  care  via  private  for-profit  insurance  companies. 
Everyone  uses  the  same  health  care  facilities. 

Although  the  federal  government  has  an  important  role  in 
specifying  national  health  care  policies  and  although  the 
Lander  control  the  hospital  sector,  the  country's  health  care  sys- 
tem is  not  government  run.  Instead,  it  is  administered  by 
national  and  regional  self-governing  associations  of  payers  and 
providers.  These  associations  play  key  roles  in  specifying  the 
details  of  national  health  policy  and  negotiate  with  one

another  about  financing  and  providing  health  care.  In  addi- 
tion, instead  of  being  paid  for  by  taxes,  the  system  is  financed 
mostly  by  health  care  insurance  premiums,  both  compulsory 
and  voluntary. 

In  early  1993,  the  Health  Care  Structural  Reform  Act 
(Gesundheitsstrukturgesetz — GSG)  came  into  effect,  marking 
the  end  of  a  more  than  a  century-long  period  in  which  benefits 
and  services  under  statutory  public  health  insurance  had  been 
extended  to  ever  larger  segments  of  the  population.  Rising 
health  expenditures  may  prompt  policy  makers  to  impose  fur- 
ther restrictions  on  providers  and  consumers  of  health  care. 
These  high  expenditures  have  been  caused  by  a  rapidly  aging 
population  (retirees'  costs  rose  by  962  percent  between  1972 
and  1992),  the  intensive  and  costly  use  of  advanced-technology 
medical  procedures,  and  other  economic  and  budgetary  pres- 
sures. As  of  mid-1995,  the  drafting  of  new  reform  proposals  was 
under  way. 

For  residents  of  the  former  GDR,  the  era  of  free  care  ended 
in  1991.  The  political  decision  to  adopt  the  FRG's  health  care 
system  required  the  reorganization  of  nearly  all  components  of 
health  care  in  the  new  Lander.  As  of  mid-1995,  the  reorganiza- 
tion of  the  health  care  system  in  the  former  GDR  still  was  far 
from  completion. 

Development  of  the  Health  Care  System 

Nearly  everyone  residing  in  Germany  is  guaranteed  access  to 
high-quality  comprehensive  health  care.  Statutory  health  insur- 
ance (Gesetzliche  Krankenversicherung — GKV)  has  provided 
an  organizational  framework  for  the  delivery  of  public  health 
care  and  has  shaped  the  roles  of  payers,  insurance  or  sickness 
funds,  and  providers,  physicians,  and  hospitals  since  the  Health 
Insurance  Act  was  adopted  in  1883.  In  1885  the  GKV  provided 
medical  protection  for  26  percent  of  the  lower-paid  segments 
of  the  labor  force,  or  10  percent  of  the  population.  As  with 
social  insurance,  health  insurance  coverage  was  gradually 
extended  by  including  ever  more  occupational  groups  in  the 
plan  and  by  steadily  raising  the  income  ceiling.  Those  earning 
less  than  the  ceiling  were  required  to  participate  in  the  insur- 
ance program.  In  1995  the  income  ceiling  was  an  annual 
income  of  about  DM70, 00  in  the  old  Lander  and  DM57,600  in 
the  new  Lander. 

In  1901  transport  and  office  workers  came  to  be  covered  by 
public  health  insurance,  followed  in  1911  by  agricultural  and 


212 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

forestry  workers  and  domestic  servants,  and  in  1914  by  civil  ser- 
vants. Coverage  was  extended  to  the  unemployed  in  1918,  to 
seamen  in  1927,  and  to  all  dependents  in  1930.  In  1941  legisla- 
tion was  passed  that  allowed  workers  whose  incomes  had  risen 
above  the  income  ceiling  for  compulsory  membership  to  con- 
tinue their  insurance  on  a  voluntary  basis.  The  same  year,  cov- 
erage was  extended  to  all  retired  Germans.  Salespeople  came 
under  the  plan  in  1966,  self-employed  agricultural  workers  in 
1972,  and  students  and  the  disabled  in  1975. 

The  1883  health  insurance  law  did  not  address  the  relation- 
ship between  sickness  funds  and  doctors.  The  funds  had  full 
authority  to  determine  which  doctors  became  participating 
doctors  and  to  set  the  rules  and  conditions  under  which  they 
did  so.  These  rules  and  conditions  were  laid  down  in  individual 
contracts.  Doctors,  who  had  grown  increasingly  dissatisfied 
with  these  contracts  and  their  limited  access  to  the  practice  of 
medicine  with  the  sickness  funds,  mobilized  and  founded  a 
professional  association  (Hartmannbund)  in  1900  and  even 
went  on  strike  several  times.  In  1913  doctors  and  sickness  funds 
established  a  system  of  collective  bargaining  to  determine  the 
distribution  of  licenses  and  doctors'  remuneration.  This 
approach  is  still  practiced,  although  the  system  has  undergone 
many  modifications  since  1913. 

The  formation  of  two  German  states  in  the  second  half  of 
the  1940s  resulted  in  two  different  German  health  systems.  In 
East  Germany,  a  centralized  state-run  system  was  put  in  place, 
and  physicians  became  state  employees.  In  West  Germany,  the 
prewar  system  was  reestablished.  It  was  supervised  by  the  gov- 
ernment but  was  not  government  run.  According  to  the  Basic 
Law  of  1949,  Germany's  constitution,  the  federal  government 
has  exclusive  authority  in  public  health  insurance  matters  and 
sets  broad  policy  in  relation  to  the  GKV.  The  government's 
authority  applies  in  particular  to  benefits,  eligibility,  compul- 
sory membership,  covered  risks  (physical,  emotional,  mental, 
curative,  and  preventive),  income  maintenance  during  tempo- 
rary illness,  employer-employee  contributions  to  the  GKV,  and 
other  central  issues.  However,  except  for  the  funding  of  some 
benefits  and  the  planning  and  financing  of  hospitals,  the 
responsibility  for  administering  and  providing  health  care  has 
been  delegated  to  nonstate  entities,  including  national  and 
regional  associations  of  health  care  providers,  Land  hospital 
associations,  nonprofit  insurance  funds,  private  insurance  com- 
panies, and  voluntary  organizations. 


213 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Portability  of  coverage,  eligibility,  and  benefits  are  indepen- 
dent of  any  regional  and/ or  local  reinterpretations  by  either 
insurers,  politicians,  administrators,  or  health  care  providers. 
Universal  coverage  is  honored  by  any  medical  office  or  hospi- 
tal. Check-ins  at  doctors'  offices,  hospitals,  and  specialized  facil- 
ities are  simple,  and  individuals  receive  immediate  medical 
attention.  No  one  in  need  of  care  can  be  turned  away  without 
running  a  risk  of  violating  the  code  of  medical  ethics  or  Land 
hospital  laws. 

The  health  care  system  has  achieved  a  high  degree  of  equity 
and  justice,  despite  its  fragmented  federal  organization:  no  sin- 
gle group  is  in  a  position  to  dictate  the  terms  of  service  deliv- 
ery, reimbursement,  remuneration,  quality  of  care,  or  any 
other  important  concerns.  The  right  to  health  care  is  regarded 
as  sacrosanct.  Universality  of  coverage,  comprehensive  bene- 
fits, the  principle  of  the  healthy  paying  for  the  sick,  and  a  ^dis- 
tributive element  in  the  financing  of  health  care  have  been 
endorsed  by  all  political  parties  and  are  secured  in  the  Basic 
Law. 

By  the  mid-1990s,  health  care  benefits  provided  through  the 
GKV  were  extensive  and  included  ambulatory  care  (care  pro- 
vided by  office-based  physicians),  choice  of  office-based  physi- 
cians, hospital  care,  full  pay  to  mothers  (from  six  weeks  before 
to  eight  weeks  after  childbirth),  extensive  home  help,  health 
checkups,  sick  leave  to  care  for  relatives,  rehabilitation  and 
physical  therapy,  medical  appliances  (such  as  artificial  limbs), 
drugs,  and  stays  of  up  to  one  month  in  health  spas  every  few 
years.  Persons  who  are  unable  to  work  because  of  illness  receive 
full  pay  for  six  weeks,  then  80  percent  of  their  income  for  up  to 
seventy-eight  weeks.  In  an  attempt  to  contain  costs,  beginning 
in  the  1980s  some  of  these  benefits  required  copayments  by  the 
insured.  Although  these  fees  were  generally  very  low,  some 
copayments  were  substantial.  For  example,  insured  patients 
paid  half  the  cost  of  dentures,  although  most  other  dental  care 
was  paid  by  health  insurance. 

The  system  has  managed  these  achievements  relatively  eco- 
nomically. In  1992  about  8.1  percent  of  the  gross  domestic 
product  (GDP — see  Glossary)  went  into  medical  care,  or 
US$1,232  per  capita,  compared  with  12.1  percent  of  GDP  and 
US$2,354  per  capita  in  the  United  States.  Even  so,  Germany 
devoted  about  one-third  of  its  overall  social  budget  to  health 
care,  an  amount  surpassed  only  by  retirement  payments. 


214 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

The  German  health  care  community  has  made  a  serious  and 
sustained  effort  to  control  the  growth  of  health  costs  since  the 
mid-1970s.  The  steep  rise  in  health  expenditures  in  the  first 
half  of  the  1970s  prompted  the  passage  of  the  Health  Insur- 
ance Cost  Containment  Act  of  1977.  The  law  established  an 
advisory  board,  the  Concerted  Action  in  Health  Care,  to  sug- 
gest nonbinding  guidelines  for  health  care  costs.  Chaired  by 
the  federal  minister  for  health,  its  sixty  members  represent  the 
most  important  interest  groups  having  a  stake  in  health  care. 
The  board  has  contributed  to  slowing  the  growth  of  health  care 
costs,  but  further  legislation  has  been  necessary. 

Modest  copayments  for  medications,  dental  treatment,  hos- 
pitalization, and  other  items  were  introduced  in  1982  for  mem- 
bers of  sickness  funds.  These  payments  were  further  increased 
by  the  Health  Care  Reform  Act  of  1989  (Gesundheitsre- 
formgesetz — GRG)  and  again  by  the  Health  Care  Structural 
Reform  Act  (Gesundheitsstrukturgesetz — GSG)  of  1993.  The 
GSG  also  introduced  new  regulatory  instruments  to  monitor 
more  closely  access  to  medical  practice,  to  reorganize  sickness- 
funds  governance,  and  to  control  medication  costs  and  pro- 
spective hospital  payments.  In  addition,  it  proposed  measures 
to  overcome  the  separation  between  ambulatory  medical  care 
and  hospital  care  that  prevailed  in  the  former  FRG. 

Health  Insurance 

Some  92  percent  of  Germany's  residents  receive  health  care 
through  statutory  health  insurance,  that  is,  the  GKV.  As  of  late 
1992,  the  GKV  relied  on  about  1,200  nonprofit  sickness  funds 
that  collect  premiums  from  their  members  and  pay  health  care 
providers  according  to  negotiated  agreements.  Those  not 
insured  through  these  funds,  mostly  civil  servants  and  the  self- 
employed,  have  private  for-profit  insurance.  An  estimated  0.3 
percent  of  the  population  has  no  health  insurance  of  any  kind. 
They  are  generally  the  rich  who  do  not  need  it  and  the  very 
poor,  who  receive  health  care  through  social  assistance. 

Sickness  funds  are  divided  into  two  categories:  primary 
funds  and  substitute  funds.  Workers  earning  less  than  the  peri- 
odically revised  income  ceiling  are  required  to  belong  to  the 
primary  funds;  those  earning  more  than  this  ceiling  may  be 
members  on  a  voluntary  basis.  Some  primary-fund  members 
have  a  choice  of  funds.  Others  do  not  and  become  members  of 
a  particular  fund  because  of  their  occupation  or  place  of  resi- 
dence. According  to  figures  from  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and 


215 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Social  Affairs  for  late  1992,  of  the  six  types  of  primary  funds, 
local  sickness  funds,  then  about  270  in  number,  are  the  most 
important.  Organized  geographically,  they  supply  about  46  per- 
cent of  the  insured  workforce  with  health  insurance.  About  800 
company-based  funds,  located  in  firms  with  more  than  450 
employees,  cover  about  11  percent  of  workers.  Some  180  occu- 
pational funds  organized  by  craft  cover  another  2.5  percent. 
There  are  three  other  kinds  of  primary  funds  (about  two  dozen 
in  all);  they  supply  insurance  for  self-employed  farmers,  sailors, 
and  miners  and  cover  about  4  percent  of  the  workforce.  There 
are  also  two  kinds  of  substitute  funds;  they  provide  health 
insurance  to  white-collar  and  blue-collar  workers  earning  more 
than  the  income  ceiling.  Substitute  funds  are  organized  on  a 
national  basis,  and  membership  is  voluntary.  Such  funds  cover 
about  34  percent  of  insured  workers. 

Employers  and  employees  each  pay  half  of  a  member's  pre- 
miums, which  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  averaged  between  12 
and  13  percent  of  a  worker's  gross  earnings  up  to  the  income 
ceiling.  Premiums  are  set  according  to  earnings  rather  than 
risk  and  are  not  affected  by  a  member's  marital  status,  family 
size,  or  health;  they  are  the  same  for  all  members  of  a  particu- 
lar fund  with  the  same  earnings.  In  a  household  with  two  wage 
earners,  each  pays  the  full  premium  assessed  by  his  or  her  sick- 
ness fund.  The  unemployed  remain  members  of  their  sickness 
fund.  Their  contributions  are  paid  by  federal  and  local  govern- 
ment offices,  with  one-third  coming  from  local  social  assistance 
offices.  The  contributions  of  retirees  are  paid  by  the  pension- 
ers themselves  and  by  their  pension  funds.  Thus,  the  public 
health  insurance  program  redistributes  from  higher  to  lower 
income  groups,  from  the  healthy  to  the  sick,  from  the  young  to 
the  old,  from  the  employed  to  the  unemployed,  and  from 
those  without  children  to  those  with  children. 

Because  some  funds  have  poorer  overall  health  profiles  than 
others  as  a  result  of  the  occupations  of  their  members,  the 
number  of  dependents  and  pensioners  among  its  members,  or 
other  factors,  premiums  can  range  from  as  low  as  about  6.5 
percent  to  as  much  as  16.0  percent  of  a  member's  gross  earn- 
ings. To  counter  this  inequity,  a  national  reserve  fund  makes 
payments  to  funds  with  high  numbers  of  pensioners.  The  GSG 
of  1993  mandates  an  equalization  of  contribution  rates  across 
all  sickness  funds  by  authorizing  payments  to  funds  burdened 
with  health  risks  associated  with  age  and  gender. 


216 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

About  11  percent  of  Germans  pay  for  private  health  insur- 
ance provided  by  about  forty  for-profit  insurance  carriers.  A 
good  portion  of  those  choosing  private  insurance  are  civil  ser- 
vants who  want  insurance  to  cover  the  roughly  50  percent  of 
their  medical  bills  not  covered  by  the  government.  Some  sick- 
ness-fund members  buy  additional  private  insurance  to  secure 
such  extras  as  a  private  room  or  a  choice  of  physicians  while  in 
a  hospital.  Otherwise,  the  medical  care  provided  to  the  pub- 
licly and  privately  insured  is  identical,  and  the  same  medical 
facilities  are  used.  Self-employed  persons  earning  above  the 
income  ceiling  must  have  private  insurance.  Members  of  a  sick- 
ness fund  who  leave  it  for  a  private  insurance  carrier  will  gener- 
ally not  be  allowed  to  return  to  public  insurance. 

Although  private  insurance  companies  pay  health  care  pro- 
viders about  twice  the  amount  paid  by  the  primary  sickness 
funds,  private  insurance  is  often  cheaper  than  statutory  health 
insurance,  especially  for  policyholders  without  dependents.  As 
is  the  case  for  members  of  sickness  funds,  employees  who  have 
private  insurance  have  half  their  premiums  paid  by  their 
employers.  German  private  health  insurance  is  unusual  in  that 
whatever  the  insured  person's  age,  his  or  her  premium  will 
remain  that  set  for  his  or  her  age  cohort  when  the  policy  ini- 
tially was  taken.  Premiums  rise  only  according  to  increases  in 
overall  health  care  costs.  Policyholders  generally  stay  with  their 
original  policy  because  if  they  change  companies,  they  will  pay 
the  higher  rates  of  an  older  age  cohort. 

Health  Care  Providers 

Germany's  principal  health  care  providers  are  its  physicians, 
dentists,  and  three  types  of  hospitals  (public,  private  nonprofit, 
and  private  for-profit).  The  health  industry  also  includes  large 
pharmaceutical  companies  and  the  manufacturers  of  various 
kinds  of  medical  supplies.  Public  health  departments,  which 
are  operated  by  the  Lander,  are  not  an  important  part  of  Ger- 
man health  care.  The  public  health  clinics  in  the  new  Lander 
are  being  phased  out  during  the  integration  of  the  two  medical 
systems. 

Germany's  supply  of  physicians  is  high.  Students  who  meet 
academic  requirements  have  a  constitutionally  guaranteed 
right  to  study  medicine.  This  fact,  plus  an  excellent  and  inex- 
pensive university  system,  has  resulted  in  the  country's  educat- 
ing physicians  at  a  much  higher  per  capita  rate  than  the  United 
States.  Between  1970  and  1990,  the  number  of  physicians  in 


217 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  former  West  Germany  more  than  doubled,  and  in  1991  the 
country  had  3.2  physicians  per  1,000  population,  a  higher  ratio 
than  most  other  members  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic 
Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD — see  Glossary).  (In 
1990  the  United  States  rate  was  2.3  per  1,000.)  With  11.5  physi- 
cian visits  per  person  per  year  in  1988,  West  Germans  and  Ital- 
ians went  to  a  doctor  more  frequently  than  other  Europeans. 
(In  1989  the  United  States  rate  was  5.3  visits  per  person  per 
year.)  Even  so,  expenditures  to  physicians  per  capita  amounted 
to  less  than  half  (US$193)  of  those  in  the  United  States 
(US$414). 

German  physicians  have  good  incomes  (dentists  earn  even 
more),  although  their  average  earnings  have  declined  from  six 
to  three  times  the  average  wage  since  efforts  at  cost  contain- 
ment began  in  the  1970s.  The  high  number  of  physicians  could 
reduce  physicians'  earnings  still  further.  In  addition,  many 
young  physicians  face  unemployment.  The  GSG  of  1993,  for 
example,  mandates  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  office-based 
physicians  who  treat  GKV  patients  (generally  about  90  percent 
of  physicians  join  the  association  that  allows  them  this  prac- 
tice). The  law  also  has  the  long-term  goal  of  limiting  the  num- 
ber of  specialists  in  geographic  areas  where  they  are 
overrepresented. 

German  health  care  makes  a  sharp  distinction  between  phy- 
sicians who  provide  office-based  or  ambulatory  care  and  physi- 
cians who  work  in  hospitals.  Office-based  physicians  are  fee-for- 
service  entrepreneurs  whose  incomes  depend  on  the  amount 
and  kinds  of  medical  care  they  provide.  In  contrast,  hospital 
physicians  are  salaried  employees  of  the  hospitals  in  which  they 
work.  Very  few  hospital  physicians  are  permitted  to  bill  their 
patients.  Until  recent  health  reform  legislation,  the  two  types 
of  physicians  did  not  work  together.  Once  an  ambulatory-care 
physician  decided  that  a  patient  should  enter  a  hospital  (only 
in  emergencies  could  a  patient  go  directly  to  a  hospital),  the 
patient's  care  was  entirely  taken  over  by  a  hospital-based  physi- 
cian. When  a  patient  left  the  hospital,  by  law  he  or  she  again 
came  under  the  care  of  an  office-based  physician.  Since  the 
late  1970s,  hospital-based  physicians  have  outnumbered  ambu- 
latory-care physicians.  In  1990  there  were  about  96,000  of  the 
former  and  75,000  of  the  latter  in  the  old  Lander. 

The  GRG  aimed  at  encouraging  a  better  integration  of 
office  and  hospital  care,  but  little  progress  was  made.  The  GSG 
of  1993  intended  to  lessen  the  traditional  division  by,  among 


218

Center,  New  York 


other  reforms,  making  it  possible  for  hospital-based  physicians 
to  see  their  patients  after  their  release  from  the  hospital.  It  is 
expected  that  lessening  the  separation  of  the  types  of  medical 
care  will  reduce  overall  health  care  costs,  but  as  of  mid-1995  no 
marked  successes  in  achieving  this  goal  had  been  noticed. 
Additionally,  new  budgeting  rules  that  go  into  effect  in  1996 
may  cause  outpatient  surgery,  still  unusual  in  Germany,  to 
become  more  common  by  making  it  more  profitable  for  hospi- 
tals. 

The  ownership  of  hospitals  (there  were  a  total  of  about  3,100 
hospitals  in  the  early  1990s)  is  the  outcome  of  historical  devel- 
opment and  regional  traditions  rather  than  conscious  policy 
and  has  resulted  in  three  types  of  hospitals:  public,  nonprofit, 
and  private  for-profit.  Each  type  accounts  for  about  one-third 
of  the  hospitals.  Public-sector  hospitals  are  mostly  owned  by  the 
Lander,  municipalities,  and  counties  and  provide  about  50  per- 
cent of  all  hospital  beds.  Nonprofit  hospitals,  typically  run  by 
Catholic  or  Protestant  organizations,  provide  about  35  percent 
of  the  beds,  and  for-profit  hospitals  account  for  15  percent. 

Germany  has  too  many  hospital  resources.  In  1988  the  ratio 
of  10.9  patient  beds  per  1,000  population  in  the  former  West 
Germany  was  higher  than  the  OECD  average.  The  number  of 
admissions  as  a  percentage  of  the  total  German  population  was 


219 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

21.5  percent,  significantly  above  the  OECD  average  of  16.1  per- 
cent. The  average  length  of  stay  of  16.6  days  was  below  the 
OECD  average  but  quite  high  by  United  States  standards.  Ger- 
many's inpatient  occupancy  rate  was  86.5  percent,  also  fairly 
high  by  international  standards. 

Between  1972  and  1986,  the  federal  government  and  the 
Lander  were  jointly  responsible  for  hospital  policy  making,  but 
in  1986  the  Land  governments  once  again  assumed  sole 
responsibility.  Lander  own  and  partially  finance  medical  school 
hospitals  and  accredited  teaching  hospitals.  They  enforce 
accreditation  and  licensing  of  health  facilities  and  of  health 
professionals  working  in  social  services.  The  Lander  are  respon- 
sible for  policy  development  and  implementation  of  social  and 
nursing  services,  social  assistance,  youth  services,  and  social 
work.  Most  important,  the  Lander  remain  responsible  for  the 
effective  and  efficient  allocation  and  distribution  of  hospital 
resources. 

Remuneration  of  Health  Care  Providers 

Each  year  the  national  associations  of  sickness  funds  negoti- 
ate agreements  with  the  national  associations  of  sickness-funds 
physicians.  The  same  bargaining  procedures  apply  to  dental 
care.  The  associations  work  with  guidelines  suggested  by  the 
Advisory  Council  for  the  Concerted  Action  in  Health  Care  and 
establish  umbrella  agreements  on  guidelines  for  the  delivery  of 
medical  care  and  fee  schedules  tied  to  the  relative  value  scales 
of  about  2,000  medical  procedures.  At  the  national  level,  the 
Federal  Committee  of  Sickness  Funds  Physicians  and  Sickness 
Funds  is  a  key  player,  although  it  is  little  known  outside  the  cir- 
cle of  health  care  practitioners  and  experts.  It  sets  spending 
limits  on  the  practice  of  medicine  in  physicians'  offices,  deter- 
mines the  inclusion  of  new  medical  procedures  and  preventive 
services,  adjusts  the  remuneration  of  physicians,  and  formu- 
lates guidelines  on  the  distribution  and  joint  use  of  sophisti- 
cated medical  technology  and  equipment  by  ambulatory-care 
or  office-based  physicians  and  hospital  physicians. 

At  the  regional  level,  regional  associations  of  sickness  funds 
and  regional  associations  of  sickness-funds  physicians  negotiate 
specific  contracts,  including  overall  health  budgets,  reimburse- 
ment contracts  for  all  physicians  in  a  region,  procedures  for 
monitoring  physicians,  and  reference  standards  for  prescrip- 
tion drugs.

A  key  instrument  for  containing  GKV  health  care  costs  is  the 
global  budget,  introduced  in  the  mid-1980s,  which  sets  limits 
on  total  health  care  expenditures.  The  GSG  of  1993  retained 
cost  containment  methods  until  1996,  when  it  is  hoped  that 
structural  reforms  will  no  longer  make  it  necessary.  By  means 
of  the  global  budget,  regional  increases  in  total  medical  expen- 
ditures are  linked  to  overall  wage  increases  of  sickness-funds 
members.  The  sickness  funds  transfer  monies  amounting  to 
the  negotiated  budget  to  the  regional  associations  of  sickness- 
funds  physicians;  the  associations  pay  their  members  on  the 
basis  of  points  earned  from  services  performed  in  a  billing 
period.  The  value  of  the  services  is  determined  by  the  negoti- 
ated fee-for-service  schedule,  which  assigns  points  to  each  ser- 
vice according  to  the  relative  value  scale.  No  exchange  of 
money  occurs  between  sickness-fund  patient  and  physician.  Pri- 
vately insured  patients  pay  their  physicians  themselves  and  are 
reimbursed  by  their  insurance  companies. 

The  monetary  value  of  a  point  is  determined  by  dividing  the 
total  value  of  points  billed  by  all  sickness-funds  physicians  into 
the  region's  total  negotiated  health  budget.  A  greater  than 
expected  number  of  services  billed  will  mean  that  a  point  has 
less  value,  and  a  physician  will  earn  less  for  a  particular  service 
than  in  a  previous  year.  To  prevent  physicians  from  attempting 
to  earn  more  by  billing  more  services,  committees  of  doctors 
and  sickness  funds  closely  scrutinize  physician  practices.  Excess 
billing  practices  are  easily  detected  by  means  of  statistical  pro- 
files of  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  practices  that  identify  depar- 
tures of  individual  doctors  from  the  group  average  (a  form  of 
community  rating).  Physicians  found  guilty  of  improper  con- 
duct are  penalized.  The  same  procedures  apply  to  dentists. 

Land  hospital  associations  and  Land  associations  of  sickness 
funds  negotiate  the  general  standards  for  hospital  care  and 
procedures  and  criteria  by  which  to  monitor  the  appropriate 
and  efficient  delivery  of  medical  care.  Each  hospital  negotiates 
a  contract  on  hospital  care  and  the  prices  for  hospital  services 
with  the  regional  sickness-funds  association.  Until  1993  hospi- 
tals' operating  costs  (of  which  salaries  made  up  as  much  as  75 
percent)  were  covered  by  per  diem  rates  paid  by  public  and  pri- 
vate insurance.  Hospital  investments  and  equipment  are 
financed  by  Land  general  revenues. 

The  GSG  of  1993  developed  a  more  sophisticated  reimburse- 
ment method  for  hospitals  than  the  simple  per  diem  rate  in  an 
attempt  to  achieve  greater  hospital  efficiency  and  thereby 


221 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

reduce  costs.  The  law  requires  that  four  sets  of  costs  be  negoti- 
ated for  each  hospital:  payments  to  diagnosis-related  groups 
for  the  full  treatment  of  a  case,  with  the  possibility  of  an  extra 
payment  if  a  patient  is  hospitalized  for  an  unusual  length  of 
time;  special  payments  for  surgery  and  treatments  before  and 
after  surgery;  departmental  allowances  that  reimburse  the  hos- 
pital for  all  nursing  and  medical  procedures  per  patient  per 
day;  and  finally  a  basic  allowance  for  all  nonmedical  proce- 
dures and  covered  accommodations,  food,  television,  and  simi- 
lar expenses.  The  law  also  introduced  new  aggregate  spending 
targets  and  spending  caps  on  hospitals  for  the  period  1993  to 
1995.  Moreover,  the  law  imposes  more  stringent  capital  spend- 
ing controls  on  hospital  construction  and  expensive  medical 
equipment. 

Current  Health  Care  Issues  and  Outlook  for  the  Future 

German  health  care  has  long  overemphasized  curative  medi- 
cine and  neglected  preventive  medicine  and  health  promo- 
tion. In  1994  the  Advisory  Council  for  the  Concerted  Action  in 
Health  Care  recognized  this  imbalance  and  recommended 
improving  prenatal  and  postnatal  care,  providing  more  vacci- 
nations for  young  children,  and  better  educating  the  public 
about  the  dangers  of  alcohol  consumption  and  smoking  both 
during  pregnancy  and  at  other  times.  The  council  also  found 
that  schoolchildren  need  more  sports,  dental  care,  and  sex 
education,  and  that  they  should  be  taught  better  dietary  habits. 
Adolescents  require  better  information  about  the  dangers  of 
drug  abuse,  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  and  obesity.  All 
adults  should  exercise  more  and  make  better  use  of  available 
cancer  and  dental  screening.  The  council  further  recom- 
mended that  fewer  prescription  drugs  be  taken  (the  cost  for 
prescription  drugs  for  the  elderly  is  almost  one-third  higher 
than  the  cost  of  physician  visits).  Improving  the  control  of 
blood  pressure,  counseling  diabetics,  eliminating  occupational 
hazards,  and  promoting  self-help  groups  are  other  goals. 

The  council  also  found  that  many  older  Germans  have  bad 
dietary  habits.  Although  eating  habits  have  improved  in  recent 
decades,  the  German  diet  is  rich  in  fats,  carbohydrates,  and 
sugar  and  is  deficient  in  fruits  and  vegetables.  In  addition,  the 
consumption  of  tobacco  and  alcohol  is  high,  although  it 
decreased  between  1980  and  1990  among  both  men  and 
women.  Because  of  these  factors,  specialists  estimate  that  30  to 


222 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

40  percent  of  the  population  has  health  problems  related  to 
diet. 

Cardiovascular  diseases  are  the  cause  of  about  half  of  all 
deaths,  followed  by  cancer,  which  accounts  for  about  one-quar- 
ter of  deaths  (see  table  10,  Appendix).  Modern  medicine  has 
largely  eradicated  traditional  threats  to  health  such  as  tubercu- 
losis, diphtheria,  and  pneumonia.  Marked  improvements  are 
also  seen  in  other  areas,  such  as  infant  and  maternal  mortality 
rates.  In  1970  infant  mortality  rates  (defined  as  deaths  under 
one  year  of  age  per  1,000  live  births)  were  18.5  in  the  former 
East  Germany  and  23.4  in  the  former  West  Germany,  com- 
pared with  an  estimated  6.3  in  united  Germany  by  1995.  Mater- 
nal deaths  fell  from  140  per  100,000  live  births  in  the  mid- 
1950s  to  fewer  than  ten  per  100,000  by  1989  in  the  former  West 
Germany.  A  similar  improvement  was  measured  in  the  former 
East  Germany. 

A  new  health  problem  is  acquired  immune  deficiency  syn- 
drome (AIDS).  By  late  1994,  a  total  of  11,854  AIDS  cases  had 
been  reported  in  Germany. 

Another  institutional  challenge  is  extending  the  old  Lander 
health  care  system  based  on  statutory  health  insurance  to  the 
new  Lander.  Achieving  this  goal  has  meant  a  complete  overhaul 
of  the  GDR's  state-run  and  highly  centralized  system;  the  intro- 
duction of  insurance  funds,  private  insurance,  and  voluntary 
organizations;  and  the  training  of  physicians  to  become  fee-for- 
service  entrepreneurs,  rather  than  salaried  state  employees  as 
they  were  under  the  old  system.  The  Treaty  on  Monetary,  Eco- 
nomic, and  Social  Union  of  May  18,  1990,  also  set  the  goal  of 
bringing  hospitals  in  the  former  GDR  up  to  the  standards  of 
those  in  the  West.  An  ambitious  program  to  invest  about  US$1 
billion  per  year  beginning  in  1995  will  be  aimed  at  this  last 
goal,  with  about  40  percent  of  funds  coming  from  the  federal 
government,  another  40  percent  from  the  new  Lander,  and  20 
percent  from  public  and  private  insurance  carriers.  It  is 
expected  that  realization  of  the  full  integration  of  the  two 
health  systems  will  take  many  years,  however. 

Education 

Germany  has  one  of  the  world's  best  and  most  extensive 
school  and  university  systems.  Although  shortcomings  exist,  on 
the  whole  the  country's  varied  and  multifaceted  education  sys- 
tem addresses  well  the  needs  of  a  population  with  widely  differ- 
ing characteristics  and  abilities.  Some  young  people  are  best 


223 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

served  by  a  traditional  classroom-based  education  that  pre- 
pares them  for  study  at  a  wide  choice  of  institutions  of  higher 
learning.  Others  profit  more  from  vocational  training  and  edu- 
cation consisting  of  on-the-job  training  combined  with  class- 
room instruction.  At  the  end  of  this  kind  of  education, 
graduates  enter  the  workforce  with  a  useful  skill  or  profession. 
Other  students  may  choose  one  of  many  combinations  of  ele- 
ments of  these  two  paths,  or  decide  later  in  life  to  embark  on 
one  of  them  by  means  of  adult  education  and  night  school. 
Because  education  in  Germany  costs  little  compared  with  that 
in  the  United  States,  for  example,  and  because  educational 
support  of  various  kinds  is  widely  available,  Germans  are  likely 
to  receive  education  and  training  suited  to  their  abilities  and 
desires. 

But  however  well  Germans  have  arranged  their  system  of 
education,  problems  remain.  The  integration  of  two  entirely 
different  education  systems  within  the  country's  highly  federal- 
ized system  had  not  been  completed  as  of  mid-1995.  In  addi- 
tion, the  country's  vaunted  system  of  higher  education  is  beset 
by  severe  overcrowding  despite  its  great  expansion  since  the 
1960s.  Moreover,  many  who  begin  study  at  the  university  level 
are  not  adequately  prepared  to  meet  its  demands.  Many  others 
who  successfully  complete  their  courses  of  study  can  find  no 
suitable  employment  once  they  graduate.  Solving  these  prob- 
lems will  engage  the  country's  educators  and  public  into  the 
next  century. 

Historical  Background 

The  origins  of  the  German  education  system  date  back  to 
church  schools  in  the  Middle  Ages.  The  first  university  was 
founded  in  1386  in  Heidelberg;  others  were  subsequently 
established  in  Cologne,  Leipzig,  Freiburg,  and  a  number  of 
other  cities.  These  universities,  which  trained  only  a  small  intel- 
lectual elite  of  a  few  thousand,  focused  on  the  classics  and  reli- 
gion. In  the  sixteenth  century,  the  Reformation  led  to  the 
founding  of  universities  along  sectarian  lines.  It  was  also  in  this 
century  that  cities  promulgated  the  first  regulations  regarding 
elementary  schools.  By  the  eighteenth  century,  elementary 
schools  had  increasingly  been  separated  from  churches  and 
had  come  under  the  direction  of  state  authorities.  Prussia,  for 
example,  made  school  attendance  for  all  children  between  the 
ages  of  five  and  fourteen  compulsory  in  1763.  A  number  of  uni- 


224 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

versities  dedicated  to  science  also  came  into  being  in  the  eigh- 
teenth century. 

The  defeat  of  Prussia  by  France  led  to  a  reform  of  education 
by  the  Berlin  scholar  Wilhelm  von  Humboldt  (1767-1835).  His 
reforms  in  secondary  schools  have  shaped  the  German  educa- 
tion system  to  the  present  day.  He  required  university-level 
training  for  high  school  teachers  and  modernized  the  struc- 
ture and  curriculum  of  the  Gymnasium,  the  preparatory  school. 
He  also  proposed  an  orientation  phase  after  the  Gymnasium 
and  a  qualifying  examination  known  as  the  Abitur  for  university 
admission.  In  1810  Humboldt  founded  the  university  in  Berlin 
that  now  bears  his  name.  Humboldt  also  introduced  the  three 
principles  that  guided  German  universities  until  the  1960s:  aca- 
demic freedom,  the  unity  of  teaching  and  research,  and  self- 
government  by  the  professors.  Also  of  much  influence  in  edu- 
cation, both  within  Germany  and  abroad,  was  Friedrich 
Froebel's  development  of  the  kindergarten  in  1837. 

For  much  of  the  nineteenth  century,  Germany  had  two  dis- 
tinctive educational  tracks:  the  Gymnasium,  which  provided  a 
classical  education  for  elites;  and  the  Volksschule,  which  was 
attended  for  eight  years  by  about  90  percent  of  children.  The 
two  schools  were  administered  and  supervised  separately.  Later 
in  the  century,  two  additional  types  of  school  emerged:  the 
Realgymnasium,  which  substituted  modern  languages  for  the 
classics,  and  the  Oberrealschule,  which  emphasized  mathematics 
and  science.  Most  children,  however,  could  not  attend  the 
schools  that  prepared  students  for  the  professions  or  university 
entrance  because  of  the  schools'  high  standards  and  long  dura- 
tion. Hence,  around  the  turn  of  the  century,  the  Mittelschule,  or 
middle  school,  was  introduced  to  meet  parental  demand  for 
expanded  educational  and  economic  opportunities.  Children 
entered  the  Mittelschule  after  three  years  of  elementary  school, 
and  they  attended  that  school  for  six  years. 

In  the  nineteenth  century,  new  universities  were  established 
in  a  number  of  major  German  cities,  including  Munich,  Ham- 
burg, and  Frankfurt  am  Main.  The  older  universities  had  been 
located  mainly  in  smaller  cities,  such  as  Heidelberg.  Many  of 
the  new  universities  were  technical  universities,  and  Germany 
soon  attained  a  leadership  in  science  that  it  lost  only  with 
World  War  II.  Universities  were  state  supported  but  largely 
independent  in  matters  of  curriculum  and  administration.  A 
university  degree  brought  much  social  status  and  was  the  pre- 


225 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

requisite  for  entering  the  professions  and  the  higher  levels  of 
the  civil  service. 

A  serious  problem  of  German  education  before  World  War  I 
was  the  rigid  differentiation  between  primary  education, 
received  by  all,  and  secondary  education,  received  mainly  by 
the  children  of  the  more  prosperous  classes.  This  division 
meant  that  most  children  of  the  poor  had  no  access  to  second- 
ary schooling  and  subsequent  study  at  the  university  level.  After 
the  war,  the  Weimar  constitution  outlined  a  democratic  vision 
of  education  that  would  address  the  problem:  supervision  by 
the  state,  with  broad  legislative  powers  over  education;  uniform 
teacher  training;  a  minimum  of  eight  years  of  primary  school 
attendance;  continuing  education  until  the  age  of  eighteen 
years;  and  free  education  and  teaching  materials.  Many  of 
these  reform  proposals  never  came  to  fruition,  however. 

During  the  Hitler  era  (1933-45),  the  national  government 
reversed  the  tradition  of  provincial  and  local  control  of  educa- 
tion and  sought  centralized  control  as  part  of  the  regime's  aim 
to  impose  its  political  and  racist  ideology  on  society  Despite  an 
agreement  with  the  Vatican  that  theoretically  guaranteed  the 
independence  of  Roman  Catholic  schools,  during  the  1930s 
the  regime  considerably  reduced  church  control  of  the  paro- 
chial school  system.  Universities  also  lost  their  independence. 
By  1936  approximately  14  percent  of  all  professors  had  been 
dismissed  because  of  their  political  views  or  ethnic  back- 
ground. The  introduction  of  two  years  of  military  service  and 
six  months  of  required  labor  led  to  a  rapid  decline  in  university 
enrollment.  By  1939  all  but  six  universities  had  closed. 

After  the  defeat  of  the  Hitler  regime  in  1945,  the  rebuilding 
of  the  education  system  in  the  occupied  zones  was  influenced 
by  the  political  interests  and  educational  philosophy  of  the 
occupying  powers:  the  United  States,  Britain,  and  France  in 
what  became  West  Germany;  and  the  Soviet  Union  in  East  Ger- 
many. As  a  result,  two  different  education  systems  developed. 
Their  political,  ideological,  and  cultural  objectives  and  their 
core  curricula  reflected  the  socioeconomic  and  political-ideo- 
logical environments  that  prevailed  in  the  two  parts  of  Ger- 
many from  1945  to  1989. 

The  Western  Allies  had  differing  views  on  education,  but  the 
insistence  of  the  United  States  on  the  "reeducation"  of  German 
youth,  meaning  an  education  in  and  for  democracy,  proved  the 
most  persuasive.  Thus,  the  West  German  education  system  was 
shaped  by  the  democratic  values  of  federalism,  individualism,

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

and  the  provision  of  a  range  of  educational  choices  and  oppor- 
tunities by  a  variety  of  public  and  private  institutions.  Students 
began  to  express  themselves  more  freely  than  before  and  to 
exercise  a  greater  degree  of  influence  on  education.  In  West 
Germany,  religious  institutions  regained  their  footing  and  rep- 
utation. By  contrast,  the  East  German  education  system  was 
centralized.  The  communist-controlled  Socialist  Unity  Party  of 
Germany  (Sozialistische  Einheitspartei  Deutschlands — SED) 
retained  a  monopoly  over  education  and  subjected  it  to  rigid 
control. 

Both  Germanys  faced  the  task  of  "denazifying"  teachers  and 
reeducating  students,  but  they  moved  in  different  directions. 
The  authorities  in  the  East  sought  teachers  who  had  opposed 
fascism  and  who  were  committed  to  a  Marxist-Leninist  ideol- 
ogy. In  the  West,  authorities  dismissed  several  thousand  teach- 
ers and  replaced  them  with  educators  holding  democratic 
values.  The  ensuing  Western  reform  program  included  recon- 
structing facilities  and  reinvigorating  the  system.  In  1953 
reforms  were  introduced  that  aimed  at  standardizing  educa- 
tion throughout  the  Lander.  In  the  1960s,  reforms  were  under- 
taken that  introduced  apprentice  shops  and  new  instruction 
techniques  for  vocational  training. 

The  1970s  saw  further  major  educational  reform,  detailed  in 
the  document  Structural  Plans  for  the  Educational  System.  The 
plan  was  approved  in  1970  by  the  Council  of  Education,  which 
was  established  in  1957  to  serve  as  an  advisory  committee  for 
the  entire  education  system,  and  by  each  Land  minister  of  edu- 
cation and  cultural  affairs.  The  main  components  of  the 
reform  program  were  the  reorganization  of  the  upper  level  of 
the  Gymnasium,  the  recruitment  of  more  students  into  colleges 
and  universities,  and  the  establishment  of  the  comprehensive 
school  (Gesamtschule).  The  Gesamtschule  brings  together  the 
three  kinds  of  secondary  schools — the  Hauptschule,  the  Real- 
schule,  and  the  Gymnasium — in  an  attempt  to  diminish  what 
some  perceived  as  the  elitist  bias  of  the  traditional  secondary 
education  system.  The  program  also  proposed  expanding  adult 
education  and  vocational  training  programs. 

The  reform  program  achieved  some  but  not  all  of  its  goals. 
The  university  entrance  examination  was  made  easier,  and  the 
number  of  students  attending  institutions  of  higher  education 
rose  from  just  over  200,000  in  1960  to  about  1.9  million  in  the 
1992-93  academic  year  (see  table  11,  Appendix).  Between 
1959  and  1979,  twenty  new  universities  were  built,  and  univer- 


228 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

sity  academic  staff  increased  from  19,000  to  78,000.  However, 
some  Germans  opposed  the  lowering  of  university  entrance 
standards,  and  some  also  resisted  the  introduction  of  the  Ge- 
samtschule.  In  addition,  the  worldwide  recession  brought  on  by 
the  oil  crisis  of  1973  caused  serious  financial  problems  for  the 
government  at  all  levels  and  made  reforms  difficult  to  realize. 

Despite  the  different  educational  policies  implemented  by 
the  two  Germanys  between  1945  and  1990,  both  systems 
regarded  education  as  a  constitutional  right  and  a  public 
responsibility,  emphasized  the  importance  of  a  broad  general 
education  (Allgemeinbildung) ,  taught  vocational  education 
through  the  so-called  dual  system  that  combined  classroom 
instruction  with  on-the-job  training,  required  students  to  pass 
the  Abitur  examination  before  beginning  university  studies, 
and  were  committed  to  Humboldt's  concept  of  university  stu- 
dents' becoming  educated  by  doing  research.  Despite  these 
similarities,  the  systems  differed  in  many  important  details,  and 
the  structural  divergence  was  considerable. 

Educational  Policy  Making  and  Administration 

The  Basic  Law  of  1949  reaffirmed  the  nineteenth-century 
tradition  under  which  the  Lander  were  responsible  for  educa- 
tion. Article  30  clearly  established  the  autonomy  of  the  Lander 
in  most  educational  and  cultural  matters,  including  the  financ- 
ing of  education,  the  maintenance  of  schools,  teacher  training, 
the  setting  of  teachers'  qualifications  and  educational  stan- 
dards, and  the  development  of  standardized  curricula.  In 
higher,  or  tertiary,  education,  the  Lander  share  responsibility 
with  the  federal  government.  The  federal  government,  for 
example,  oversees  vocational  education  and  training,  a  very 
important  component  of  Germany's  system  of  education.  The 
federal  government  also  controls  the  financing  of  stipends  and 
educational  allowances  and  the  promotion  of  research  and 
support  of  young  scientists  through  fellowships.  In  addition, 
the  federal  government  also  has  passed  framework  laws  on  gen- 
eral principles  of  higher  education.  However,  the  federal  gov- 
ernment has  no  power  to  reform  higher  education  institutions; 
this  power  remains  a  prerogative  of  the  Lander. 

Most  teachers  and  university-level  professors  are  civil  ser- 
vants with  life  tenure  and  high  standing  in  society.  They  receive 
generous  fringe  benefits  and  relatively  lucrative  compensation, 
while  making  no  contributions  to  social  security  programs.  In 
Bavaria,  for  example,  the  average  starting  salary  for  an  elemen-

tary  or  secondary  school  teacher  in  the  early  1990s  was  about 
US$40,000.  A  senior  teacher  in  a  Gymnasium  earned  about 
US$53,000. 

Postsecondary  education  is  a  shared  responsibility  imple- 
mented through  "cooperative  federalism"  and  joint  policy 
areas.  The  federal  government  and  the  sixteen  old  Lander 
cooperate  extensively  with  regard  to  the  establishment,  expan- 
sion, and  modernization  of  institutions  of  higher  education, 
including  their  financing. 

To  counterbalance  decentralized  authority  and  provide  lead- 
ership in  education,  the  development  of  educational  policy 
and  implementation  is  influenced  by  a  number  of  nationwide 
joint  permanent  advisory  bodies.  These  include  the  Planning 
Committee  for  the  Construction  of  Institutions  of  Higher 
Learning  and  the  Scientific  Council.  Planning  for  education 
and  the  promotion  of  research  by  the  federal  government  and 
the  Lander  have  become  more  important  since  unification  and 
are  implemented  by  the  Federal  and  Land  Commission  on 
Educational  Planning  and  the  Promotion  of  Research. 

Educational  Finances 

Education  is  the  second  largest  item  of  public  spending  after 
social  security  and  welfare  and  in  the  1990-91  academic  year 
amounted  to  4  percent  of  GNP.  Education  is  not  paid  for  by 
local  property  taxes  but  rather  out  of  general  revenues.  Since 
1949  the  federal  government,  the  Lander,  and  the  local  govern- 
ments, including  in  some  cases  intercommunal  single  or  multi- 
purpose districts  (Zweckverbande) ,  have  shared  in  financing 
education.  For  elementary,  primary,  and  secondary  education, 
the  Lander  and  the  local  governments  are  the  major  funding 
sources.  The  Lander  are  responsible  for  teachers'  salaries,  cur- 
riculum development,  and  the  setting  of  standards  and  qualifi- 
cations.  Local  governments  are  responsible  for  the 
maintenance  and  operation  of  school  facilities.  The  Lander 
remain  the  main  source  of  funding  for  higher  education,  but 
the  federal  government  also  plays  a  role.  In  1991  the  Lander 
paid  about  74  percent  of  total  education  costs  (68  percent  in 
1970);  local  governments  contributed  16  percent  (24  percent 
in  1970);  and  the  federal  government  contributed  10  percent 
(8  percent  in  1970). 

The  Education  System 

The  Basic  Law  of  1949  grants  every  German  citizen  the  right 


230 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

to  self-fulfillment.  In  theory,  citizens  are  able  to  choose  the 
type  of  education  they  want  and  are  given  access  to  their  pre- 
ferred occupation  or  profession.  The  goal  of  educational  pol- 
icy is  therefore  to  provide  each  citizen  with  opportunities  to 
grow  personally,  professionally,  and  as  a  citizen  in  accordance 
with  his  or  her  abilities  and  preferences.  The  Lander  axe  to  pro- 
vide equal  educational  opportunities  and  quality  education  for 
all  through  a  variety  of  educational  institutions. 

Education  is  free  and  in  most  types  of  school  is  coeduca- 
tional. Almost  all  elementary  and  secondary  schools  and  about 
95  percent  of  higher  education  institutions  are  public.  College, 
graduate,  and  postgraduate  students  pay  a  nominal  fee  ranging 
from  DM35  to  DM60  a  semester,  which  includes  extensive 
rights  to  health  care  and  other  social  benefits.  When  churches 
or  private  organizations  run  kindergartens,  they  do  so  inde- 
pendently, and  the  public  sector  is  not  involved. 

According  to  the  terms  of  the  Dusseldorf  Treaty  of  1955,  the 
first  major  attempt  to  unify  or  coordinate  the  school  systems  of 
the  Lander,  school  attendance  is  mandatory  for  a  minimum  of 
nine  years  (or  in  some  Lander  lew  years),  beginning  at  age  six. 
A  student  who  starts  vocational  training  as  an  apprentice  must 
attend  a  part-time  vocational  school  until  the  age  of  eighteen. 

Elementary  and  Primary  Education 

The  first  level  of  education  is  called  elementary  education 
and  consists  of  kindergarten  for  children  ages  three  to  five  (see 
fig.  9).  Attendance  is  voluntary.  In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s, 
about  80  percent  of  children  were  in  kindergarten.  Beginning 
in  1996,  all  children  will  be  guaranteed  a  place  in  kindergar- 
ten. Because  the  former  GDR  had  maintained  an  extensive  kin- 
dergarten system,  the  new  Lander  had  enough  kindergarten 
places  to  meet  this  requirement.  In  contrast,  in  the  early  1990s 
the  old  Lander  had  only  enough  places  to  accommodate  about 
75  percent  of  children  in  the  relevant  age-group. 

The  second  level  of  education  is  called  primary  education 
and  consists  of  the  Grundschule  (basic  school).  Children 
between  the  ages  of  six  and  ten  attend  the  Grundschule  from 
grades  one  through  four.  Children  are  evaluated  in  the  fourth 
grade  and  tracked  according  to  their  academic  records, 
teacher  evaluations,  and  parent-teacher  discussions.  The  three 
tracks  lead  to  different  secondary  schools  and  play  a  significant 
role  in  determining  a  child's  subsequent  educational  options.

Junior  Secondary  Education 

Secondary  education,  the  third  level  of  education,  is  divided 
into  two  levels:  junior  secondary  education  (also  called  inter- 
mediate secondary  education)  and  senior  secondary  educa- 
tion. Upon  completion  of  the  Grundschule,  students  between 
the  ages  of  ten  and  sixteen  attend  one  of  the  following  types  of 
secondary  schools:  the  Hauptschule,  the  Realschule,  the  Gymna- 
sium, the  Gesamtschule,  or  the  Sonderschule  (for  children  with 
special  educational  needs).  Students  who  complete  this  level  of 
education  receive  an  intermediate  school  certificate.  Adults 
who  attend  two  years  of  classes  in  evening  schools  can  also  earn 
these  intermediate  school  certificates,  which  permit  further 
study. 

Junior  secondary  education  starts  with  two  years  (grades  five 
and  six)  of  orientation  courses  during  which  students  explore  a 
variety  of  educational  career  paths  open  to  them.  The  courses 
are  designed  to  provide  more  time  for  the  student  and  parents 
to  decide  upon  appropriate  subsequent  education. 

The  Hauptschule,  often  called  a  short-course  secondary 
school  in  English,  lasts  five  or  six  years  and  consists  of  grades 
five  to  nine  or  five  to  ten  depending  on  the  Land.  Some  Lander 
require  a  compulsory  tenth  year  or  offer  a  two-year  orientation 
program.  About  one-third  of  students  completing  primary 
school  continue  in  the  Hauptschule.  The  curriculum  stresses 
preparation  for  a  vocation  as  well  as  mathematics,  history, 
geography,  German,  and  one  foreign  language.  After  receiving 
their  diploma,  graduates  either  become  apprentices  in  shops 
or  factories  while  taking  compulsory  part-time  courses  or 
attend  some  form  of  full-time  vocational  school  until  the  age  of 
eighteen. 

Another  one-third  of  primary  school  graduates  attend  the 
Realschule,  sometimes  called  the  intermediate  school.  These 
schools  include  grades  five  through  ten.  Students  seeking 
access  to  middle  levels  of  government,  industry,  and  business 
attend  the  Realschule.  The  curriculum  is  the  same  as  that  of  the 
Hauptschule,  but  students  take  an  additional  foreign  language, 
shorthand,  wordprocessing,  and  bookkeeping,  and  they  learn 
some  computer  skills.  Graduation  from  the  Realschule  enables 
students  to  enter  a  Fachoberschule  (a  higher  technical  school)  or 
a  Fachgymnasium  (a  specialized  high  school  or  grammar  school) 
for  the  next  stage  of  secondary  education.  A  special  program 
makes  it  possible  for  a  few  students  to  transfer  into  the  Gymna- 
sium, but  this  is  exceptional. 


233 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

The  Gymnasium,  sometimes  called  high  school  or  grammar 
school  in  English,  begins  upon  completion  of  the  Grundschule 
or  the  orientation  grades  and  includes  grades  five  through  thir- 
teen. The  number  of  students  attending  the  Gymnasium  has 
increased  dramatically  in  recent  decades;  by  the  mid-1990s, 
about  one-third  of  all  primary  school  graduates  completed  a 
course  of  study  at  the  Gymnasium,  which  gives  them  the  right  to 
study  at  the  university  level.  In  the  1990s,  the  Gymnasium  con- 
tinued to  be  the  primary  educational  route  into  the  universi- 
ties, although  other  routes  have  been  created. 

The  Gesamtschule  originated  in  the  late  1960s  to  provide  a 
broader  range  of  educational  opportunities  for  students  than 
the  traditional  Gymnasium.  The  Gesamtschule  has  an  all-inclusive 
curriculum  for  students  ages  ten  to  eighteen  and  a  good  deal 
of  freedom  to  choose  coursework.  Some  schools  of  this  type 
have  been  established  as  all-day  schools,  unlike  the  Gymnasium, 
which  is  a  part-day  school  with  extensive  homework  assign- 
ments. The  popularity  of  the  Gesamtschule  has  been  mixed.  It 
has  been  resisted  in  more  conservative  areas,  especially  in 
Bavaria,  where  only  one  such  school  had  been  established  by 
the  beginning  of  the  1990s.  A  few  more  were  established  in 
Bavaria  in  the  next  few  years;  their  presence  is  marginal  when 
compared  with  the  Gymnasium,  of  which  there  were  395  in 
1994.  Even  North  Rhine-Westphalia,  Germany's  most  populous 
Land  and  an  outspoken  supporter  of  the  Gesamtschule,  had  only 
181,  compared  with  623  of  the  traditional  Gymasium. 

Senior  Secondary  Education 

The  variety  of  educational  programs,  tracks,  and  opportuni- 
ties available  to  students  increases  at  the  senior  secondary  level. 
The  largest  single  student  group  attends  the  senior  level  of  the 
Gymnasium,  the  Gymnasiale  Oberstufe.  This  level  includes  the  tra- 
ditional academically  oriented  Gymnasium,  the  vocational  Gym- 
nasium, the  occupation-specific  Fachgymnasium,  and  the 
Gesamtschule.  Graduation  from  these  schools  requires  passing 
the  Abitur,  the  qualifying  examination  for  studying  at  the  uni- 
versity level.  Until  the  late  1970s,  nearly  everyone  who  passed 
the  Abitur  had  access  to  an  institution  of  higher  education. 
However,  in  the  1980s  the  numerus  clausus,  a  restrictive  quota 
system  that  had  been  introduced  for  the  study  of  medicine  in 
the  late  1960s,  began  to  be  used  for  other  popular  fields  of 
study  Strict  selection  criteria  limiting  access  to  higher  educa-

tion  had  become  necessary  because  the  demand  for  places  at 
universities  had  become  much  greater  than  the  supply. 

Vocational  Education  and  Training 

The  German  education  system  has  been  praised  for  its  abil- 
ity to  provide  quality  general  education  combined  with  excel- 
lent specific  training  for  a  profession  or  a  skilled  occupation.  In 
1992  about  65  percent  of  the  country's  workforce  had  been 
trained  through  vocational  education.  In  the  same  year,  2.3 
million  young  people  were  enrolled  in  vocational  or  trade 
schools. 

Building  upon  the  junior  secondary  program,  the  Berufs- 
schulen  are  two-  and  three-year  vocational  schools  that  prepare 
young  people  for  a  profession.  In  the  1992-93  academic  year, 
there  were  1.8  million  enrolled  in  these  schools.  About  264,000 
individuals  attended  Berufsfachschulen,  also  called  intermediate 
technical  schools  (ITS).  These  schools  usually  offer  full-time 
vocation-specific  programs.  They  are  attended  by  students  who 
want  to  train  for  a  specialty  or  those  already  in  the  workforce 
who  want  to  earn  the  equivalent  of  an  intermediate  school  cer- 
tificate from  a  Realschule.  Full-time  programs  take  between 
twelve  and  eighteen  months,  and  part-time  programs  take 
between  three  and  three-and-one-half  years.  Other  types  of 
schools  designed  to  prepare  students  for  different  kinds  of 
vocational  careers  are  the  higher  technical  school  (HTS),  the 
Fachoberschule,  attended  by  about  75,000  persons  in  1992-93, 
and  the  advanced  vocational  school  (AVS),  the  Berufsaufbau- 
schule,  attended  by  about  6,500  persons  in  the  same  year.  Stu- 
dents can  choose  to  attend  one  of  these  three  kinds  of  schools 
after  graduating  with  an  intermediate  school  certificate  from  a 
Realschule  or  an  equivalent  school. 

The  method  of  teaching  used  in  vocational  schools  is  called 
the  dual  system  because  it  combines  classroom  study  with  a 
work-related  apprenticeship  system.  The  length  of  schooling/ 
training  depends  on  prior  vocational  experience  and  may 
entail  one  year  of  full-time  instruction  or  up  to  three  years  of 
part-time  training. 

Students  can  earn  the  Fachhochschulreife  after  successfully 
completing  vocational  education  and  passing  a  qualifying 
entrance  examination.  The  Fachhochschulreife  entitles  a  student 
to  enter  a  Fachhochschule,  or  a  training  college,  and  to  continue 
postsecondary  occupational  or  professional  training  in  engi- 
neering or  technical  fields.  Such  programs  last  from  six 


235 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

months  to  three  years  (full-time  instruction)  or  six  to  eight 
years  (part-time  instruction).  Some  students  with  many  years  of 
practical  experience  or  those  with  special  skills  may  also  attend 
a  Fachhochschule. 

Vocational  education  and  training  is  a  joint  government- 
industry  program.  The  federal  government  and  the  Lander 
share  in  the  financing  of  vocational  education  in  public  voca- 
tional schools,  with  the  federal  government  bearing  a  slightly 
higher  share  (58  percent  in  1991)  than  the  Lander.  On-the-job 
vocational  training,  whose  cost  is  entirely  borne  by  companies 
and  businesses,  is  more  costly  to  provide  than  vocational  educa- 
tion. In  the  early  1990s,  companies  and  businesses  annually 
spent  2  percent  of  their  payrolls  on  training. 

Tertiary  or  Higher  Education 

In  the  1992-93  academic  year,  higher  education  was  avail- 
able at  314  institutions  of  higher  learning,  with  about  1.9  mil- 
lion students  enrolled.  Institutions  of  higher  learning  included 
eighty-one  universities  and  technical  universities,  seven  com- 
prehensive universities  (Gesamthochschuleri) ,  eight  teacher-train- 
ing colleges,  seventeen  theological  seminaries,  126  profession- 
specific  technical  colleges,  thirty  training  facilities  in  public 
administration  (Verwaltungsfachhochschulen) ,  and  forty-five  acad- 
emies for  art,  music,  and  literature.  Nearly  80  percent,  or  250, 
of  these  institutions  were  located  in  the  old  Lander,  and  sixty- 
four  were  in  the  new  Lander.  Baden-Wurttemberg  and  North 
Rhine-Westphalia  had  the  largest  share  of  these  institutions, 
sixty-one  and  forty-nine,  respectively.  In  1990  about  69.7  per- 
cent of  students  at  tertiary-level  institutions  went  to  universities 
and  engineering  schools,  and  another  21. V  percent  attended 
vocational  training  colleges  (Fachhochschulen) . 

German  university  students  can  complete  their  first  degree 
in  about  five  years,  but  on  average  university  studies  last  seven 
years.  Advanced  degrees  require  further  study.  Because  tuition 
at  institutions  of  higher  education  amounts  to  no  more  than  a 
nominal  fee  except  at  the  handful  of  private  universities,  study 
at  the  university  level  means  only  meeting  living  expenses.  An 
extensive  federal  and  Land  program  provides  interest-free 
loans  to  students  coming  from  lower-income  households.  Half 
of  the  loan  must  be  paid  within  five  years  of  graduation.  Stu- 
dents graduating  in  the  top  third  of  their  class  or  within  a 
shorter  time  than  usual  have  portions  of  their  loans  forgiven. 
Loans  are  also  available  to  students  receiving  technical  and 


236

vocational  training.  In  the  early  1990s,  about  half  of  all  stu- 
dents were  obliged  to  work  while  attending  university. 

Unlike  the  United  States,  Germany  does  not  have  a  group  of 
elite  universities;  none  enjoys  a  reputation  for  greater  overall 
excellence  than  is  enjoyed  by  the  others.  Instead,  particular 
departments  of  some  universities  are  commonly  seen  as  very 
good  in  their  field.  For  example,  the  University  of  Cologne  has 
a  noted  economics  faculty.  Also  in  contrast  to  the  United 
States,  German  universities  do  not  offer  much  in  the  way  of 
campus  life,  and  collegiate  athletics  are  nearly  nonexistent. 
Universities  generally  consist  of  small  clusters  of  buildings  dis- 
persed throughout  the  city  in  which  they  are  located.  Students 
do  not  live  on  university  property,  although  some  are  housed  in 
student  dormitories  operated  by  churches  or  other  nonprofit 
organizations.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Education  in  the  New  Lander 

The  Soviet-supported  SED  centralized  and  politicized  educa- 
tion far  more  than  had  been  the  case  during  the  Hitler  era. 
About  70  percent  of  teachers  and  all  school  counselors,  super- 
intendents, members  of  the  teachers'  union,  and  school  admin- 
istrators were  SED  members,  often  performing  both 
professional  and  party  functions.  In  theory,  parents  were  part 
of  the  educational  process,  but  in  practice  they  were  expected 
to  support  party  educational  policy.  Teacher-student  ratios 
were  low — 1:5  compared  with  1:18  in  West  Germany. 

Under  the  new  system,  public  education  was  expanded  by 
establishing  preschools  and  kindergartens.  Because  most 
women  returned  to  work  after  six  months  of  maternity  leave, 
these  new  schools  were  widely  attended.  Lowered  standards  of 
admission  and  scholarships  expanded  access  to  higher  educa- 
tion for  working-class  children  and  diminished  its  elitist  bias. 
The  state  emphasized  education  in  "socialist  values"  and  Marx- 
ism-Leninism  at  all  levels  of  the  system,  following  the  Soviet 
model.  Students  were  required  to  spend  one  day  per  week 
working  in  a  factory,  in  an  office,  or  on  a  farm  in  order  to  rein- 
force the  importance  of  labor. 

In  terms  of  organization,  all  types  of  schools  were  replaced 
by  a  uniform  ten-grade  polytechnical  school,  which  empha- 
sized technical  education.  Upon  graduation  from  this  school, 
about  85  percent  of  students  entered  a  two-year  vocational  edu- 
cation school.  The  remaining  students  attended  special  classes 
to  prepare  for  university  studies,  some  going  to  an  extension  of 
secondary  school  for  two  years,  others  attending  vocational 
school  for  three  years.  The  GDR  had  six  universities,  nine  tech- 
nical universities,  and  several  dozen  specialized  institutions  of 
higher  education.  In  the  1950s  and  1960s,  the  children  of 
workers  were  favored  for  university  study.  In  later  decades,  the 
children  of  the  intelligentsia  (state  officials,  professionals,  and 
academicians)  again  formed  a  greater  part  of  the  student  pop- 
ulation. However,  in  addition  to  passing  the  qualifying  exami- 
nation, students  had  to  demonstrate  political  loyalty  and 
commitment  to  Marxist-Leninist  ideology.  Throughout  their 
schooling,  children  were  constantly  exposed  to  party  ideology 
and  values. 

The  system  had  a  strong  vocational  element  that  focused  on 
providing  a  bridge  to  adult  work.  The  system  was  particularly 
successful  in  some  respects;  literacy  was  practically  universal  by 
1989,  and  the  proportion  of  unskilled  workers  and  trainees  in 


238 


Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

the  workforce  fell  from  70  percent  in  1955  to  13  percent  in 
1989.  The  system  was  best  suited  to  the  teaching  of  mathemat- 
ics, the  natural  sciences,  and  other  technical  and  nonideologi- 
cal  subjects.  It  was  less  effective  in  teaching  the  social  sciences, 
current  affairs,  and  information  technology.  Language  teach- 
ing emphasized  Russian,  which  was  compulsory.  Few  learned 
other  European  languages  such  as  English  or  French. 

The  revolutionary  events  of  November  1989  led  to  an 
abrupt  transformation  of  the  institutional,  political,  and  philo- 
sophical foundations  of  education  in  the  GDR.  In  heated 
debates,  grassroots  groups  of  parents,  teachers,  and  citizens  dis- 
cussed the  future  of  education  and  vocational  training  in  the 
new  Lander.  By  May  1990,  the  GDR  educational  leadership  had 
been  dismissed,  and  steps  had  been  taken  to  reduce  the 
bloated  educational  bureaucracy.  Evaluation  commissions  reas- 
sessed the  quality  of  research  and  academic  institutions  and 
their  staff,  and  many  social  science  departments  suspended 
activity  until  they  were  evaluated.  Departments  of  Marxism- 
Leninism  were  closed  outright,  and  most  institutions  modeled 
on  the  Soviet  system  were  dismantled. 

In  May  1990,  the  ministers  of  education  of  the  Lander  agreed 
that  the  new  Lander  should  develop  their  own  educational  strat- 
egies. The  unification  treaty  of  August  31,  1990,  specified  that 
this  should  be  done  by  June  30,  1991,  when  the  new  Lander 
were  expected  to  have  passed  new  laws  on  education.  A  major 
change  effected  by  those  laws  is  the  replacement  of  the  general 
polytechnic  school  with  the  range  of  educational  models  pre- 
vailing in  West  Germany.  The  five  new  Lander,  with  the  excep- 
tion of  Brandenburg,  introduced  the  four-year  Grundschule. 
Brandenburg  established  a  six-year  Grundschule,  like  that  found 
in  Berlin.  Secondary  schooling  also  resembles  that  of  the  old 
Lander  in  that  the  Gymnasium  is  common  to  all;  however,  other 
schools  at  the  junior  secondary  level  differ  somewhat  in  their 
names  and  organization.  Education  at  the  senior  secondary 
level  resembles  closely  that  of  the  old  Lander. 

Higher  education  has  also  seen  changes.  To  improve  geo- 
graphic access  to  higher  education,  regions  previously  without 
institutions  of  higher  learning  have  received  a  number  of  such 
institutions.  In  other  regions,  institutions  of  higher  learning 
have  been  abolished,  some  of  which  have  been  replaced  by 
Fachhochschulen,  nonexistent  in  the  former  GDR.  University 
staffs  have  also  been  cut,  sometimes  by  as  much  as  50  percent. 
Within  two  or  three  years  of  unification,  about  25  percent  of 


239 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

university  faculty  were  arrivals  from  the  old  Lander.  By  late 
1994,  institutions  of  higher  learning  in  the  new  Lander  had 
benefited  from  annual  payments  from  western  Germany  of 
about  DM3  billion. 

Although  the  old  structure  has  been  replaced,  observers 
agree  that  the  values  and  preferences  internalized  by  parents, 
students,  and  teachers  who  came  to  maturity  in  the  GDR  can 
be  expected  to  survive  for  many  years.  Because  it  lasted 
decades  longer  than  nazism,  the  Marxist-Leninist  influence  on 
education  in  the  new  Lander  will  probably  take  far  longer  to 
overcome. 

Current  Education  Issues  and  Outlook  for  the  Future 

Germany's  system  of  education  faces  a  number  of  chal- 
lenges, among  them  a  surplus  of  teachers  in  a  period  of  declin- 
ing birth  rates.  A  chief  problem  is  reconciling  the  tradition  of 
Land  responsibility  for  education,  which  has  resulted  in  a  vari- 
ety of  school  types,  programs,  and  standards,  with  the  need  for 
a  uniform  national  system.  This  is  the  central  problem  con- 
cerning whether  or  how  to  integrate  the  education  systems  of 
the  new  Lander  with  those  of  the  old  Lander.  Such  an  integra- 
tion will  entail  deciding  whether  to  increase  the  number  of 
years  of  schooling  by  one  year  for  eastern  Germans  or  to 
reduce  the  thirteen  years  of  schooling  for  western  Germans  to 
twelve.  It  will  also  mean  deciding  on  whether  to  introduce  a 
postsecondary  vocational  qualifying  examination  (Fachabitur) 
in  the  new  Lander  to  mirror  the  one  that  has  existed  in  the 
former  FRG  since  the  1970s.  Other  unresolved  issues  relate  to 
such  questions  as  educational  standards,  qualifications,  and  the 
mutual  recognition  of  qualifying  examinations  and  diplomas. 
The  diversity  resulting  from  a  reluctance  to  impose  the  same 
standard  norms  and  diplomas  in  all  Lander,  in  contrast  to 
France  and  many  other  European  countries,  is  so  extreme  that 
some  observers  think  it  may  hinder  the  mobility  of  students 
and  teachers  within  Germany  and  the  larger  Europe. 

Unification  has  also  thrown  into  sharp  focus  the  ongoing 
debate  about  the  weaknesses  of  the  university  system  in  the 
former  FRG.  Many  West  German  universities  are  overcrowded, 
understaffed,  underequipped,  and  underfinanced.  Frequently 
criticized  are  the  length  and  structure  of  degree  courses,  the 
excessive  length  of  studies,  the  high  number  of  long-term  stu- 
dents, and  the  disturbingly  high  number  of  dropouts  who  leave 
higher  education  without  graduating.  Some  of  these  problems 


240 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

result  from  Germany's  success  in  expanding  access  to  second- 
ary education.  About  34  percent  of  all  students  graduated  with 
the  Abiturin  1990,  compared  with  only  11  percent  in  1970. 

Critics  charge  that  many  students  who  fail  to  complete  their 
university  studies  may  not  have  been  well  educated.  A  1994 
study  cast  serious  doubt  on  the  assumption  that  passing  the  Abi- 
tur  is  adequate  preparation  for  study  at  a  university.  It  found 
that  almost  one-third  of  those  who  had  passed  the  examination 
failed  to  complete  their  coursework  at  institutions  of  higher 
education  and  that  the  number  of  dropouts  had  quadrupled 
from  14,000  in  the  mid-1970s  to  60,000  two  decades  later.  The 
study  also  found  that  on  average,  dropouts  left  the  university 
after  three  years,  or  six  semesters,  that  women  had  a  higher 
dropout  rate  than  men,  and  that  the  highest  dropout  rate  was 
in  liberal  arts,  formerly  the  core  of  university  studies. 

Students  cited  a  lack  of  correlation  between  curriculum  con- 
tent and  career  goals  as  one  reason  for  breaking  off  their  stud- 
ies. One  out  of  three  students  also  reported  feeling 
unprepared  for  higher  education.  Other  reasons  listed  were 
the  limited  opportunities  in  the  labor  market,  overcrowding, 
anonymity  (impersonality),  a  lack  of  mentors,  and  the  poor 
quality  of  teaching.  Financial  reasons  also  were  mentioned 
more  often  than  they  had  been  in  the  mid-1970s. 

As  remedies,  some  advocate  establishing  a  better  balance 
between  pure  and  applied  research  and  teaching,  making  a  dis- 
tinction between  first-degree  courses  offering  training  for  a 
profession  and  research-oriented  postgraduate  courses,  and 
substituting  well-defined  curricula  for  the  existing  uncoordi- 
nated requirements.  Delegating  a  larger  share  of  teaching  to  a 
new  breed  of  middle-rank  lecturers  has  also  been  recom- 
mended.

The  best  and  most  comprehensive  historical  and  compara- 
tive account  of  German  social  policy,  although  published  in 
1988,  is  a  nearly  book-length  chapter  by  Jens  Alber  in  Growth  to 
Limits  (Vol.  2),  edited  by  Peter  Flora.  Peter  J.  Katzenstein  also 
provides  a  good  introduction  to  German  social  policy  in  Policy 
and  Politics  in  West  Germany.  Stephan  Leibfried  is  the  author  of 
valuable  articles  on  various  aspects  of  German  social  policy,  as 
is  Arnold  J.  Heidenheimer.  AlfredJ.  Kahn  and  Sheila  B.  Kamer-

Social  Welfare,  Health  Care,  and  Education 

Analyses  in  English  of  recent  developments  regarding  spe- 
cific programs  after  unification  are  regrettably  rare.  An  excep- 
tion is  "Social  Policy:  One  State,  Two-Tier  Welfare"  by  Steen 
Mangen.  A  new  British  periodical,  Journal  of  European  Social  Pol- 
icy, publishes  research  findings  in  English  and  is  beginning  to 
fill  the  gap  in  this  area.  Examples  of  the  journal's  articles 
include  Winifried  Schmahl's  article  on  the  1992  reform  of  pub- 
lic pensions;  Wolfgang  Voges  and  Gotz  Rohwer's  very  useful 
article  on  social  assistance;  Kirsten  Scheiwe's  report  on  poverty 
risks  of  mothers  in  Belgium,  Germany,  and  Britain;  and 
Rudolph  Bauer's  analysis  of  voluntary  welfare  associations  in 
Germany  and  the  United  States. 

The  literature  on  the  German  health  care  system  in  English 
is  extensive.  Written  for  readers  in  the  United  States  and  dating 
from  1993,  Richard  A.  Knox's  Germany:  One  Nation  with  Health 
Care  for  All  is  an  excellent  discussion  of  the  system's  compo- 
nents. A  more  recent  publication  is  Ullrich  K.  Hoffmeyer's 
long  article  "The  Health  Care  System  in  Germany."  It  includes 
a  discussion  of  the  Health  Care  Structural  Reform  Act  of  1993. 
Other  useful  sources  are  John  K.  Iglehart's  articles  in  the  New 
England  Journal  of  Medicine,  Deborah  A.  Stone's  article  "German 
Unification:  East  Meets  West  in  the  Doctor's  Office,"  and  "Glo- 
bal Budgeting  in  Germany:  Lessons  for  the  United  States"  by 
Klaus-Dirk  Henke,  Margaret  A.  Murray,  and  Claudia  Ade. 

There  is  no  recent  one-volume  comprehensive  survey  of  the 
German  education  system.  Christoph  Fuhr's  Schools  and  Institu- 
tions of  Higher  Education  in  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany,  dating 
from  1989,  is  still  quite  useful,  however,  as  is  his  more  recent 
book,  On  the  Education  System  in  the  Five  New  Laender  of  the  Federal 
Republic  of  Germany.  Also  valuable  is  Peter  J.  Katzenstein's  discus- 
sion of  university  reform  in  his  book  Policy  and  Politics  in  West 
Germany.  Val  D.  Rust  and  Diane  Rust  examine  the  difficulties  of 
integrating  the  two  German  education  systems  in  The  Unifica- 
tion of  German  Education. 

The  Press  and  Information  Office  of  the  Federal  Republic  of 
Germany  publishes  brief  accounts  in  English  and  German  on  a 
variety  of  topics,  including  social  programs.  These  can  be 
obtained  through  the  German  Information  Center  in  New 
York.  (For  further  information  and  complete  citations,  see  Bib-

Chapter  5.  The  Domestic  Economy 


The  Frankfurt  am  Main  skyline.  In  the  foreground  is  the  Paulskirche,  meeting 
place  of  the  1848-49  National  Assembly. 


THE  GERMAN  ECONOMY  is  replete  with  contradictions.  It  is 
modern  but  old-fashioned.  It  is  immensely  powerful  but  suffers 
from  serious  structural  weaknesses.  It  is  subject  to  national  laws 
and  rules  but  is  so  closely  tied  into  the  European  Union  (EU — 
see  Glossary)  that  it  is  no  longer  truly  independent.  It  has  a 
central  bank  that  controls  European  monetary  policy  and  has  a 
deepening  impact  on  the  global  economy  but  that  also  insists 
on  making  its  decisions  mainly  on  the  basis  of  domestic  consid- 
erations. Finally,  although  Germany  must  compete  against 
highly  efficient  economies  outside  its  own  continent,  it  contin- 
ues to  carry  the  expense  and  burden  of  traditional  industries 
that  drain  resources  that  could  be  better  used  elsewhere. 

The  German  economy  as  it  is  known  today  is  an  outgrowth 
of  the  1990  merger  between  the  dominant  economy  of  the  Fed- 
eral Republic  of  Germany  (FRG,  or  West  Germany)  and  that  of 
the  German  Democratic  Republic  (GDR,  or  East  Germany). 
This  merger  will  one  day  produce  a  massive  economic  entity 
that  will  constitute  the  fulcrum  of  Europe  as  a  production  cen- 
ter, as  well  as  a  transportation  and  communications  center.  But 
each  partner  brings  different  elements  to  the  mix,  and  the 
merger  has  proved  difficult  and  costly.  The  merger  will  domi- 
nate Germany's  economic  policy  and  reality  until  well  into  the 
next  century. 

The  record  of  the  West  German  economy  during  the  four 
decades  before  unification  shows  a  signal  achievement.  The 
first  decade,  that  of  the  1950s,  had  been  that  of  the  "economic 
miracle."  The  second  decade,  that  of  the  1960s,  had  seen  con- 
solidation and  the  first  signs  of  trouble.  The  1970s  had  brought 
the  oil  shocks,  the  generous  social  programs,  the  rising  deficits, 
and  finally  a  loss  of  control.  In  the  1980s,  new  policies  at  home 
and  a  more  stable  environment  abroad  had  combined  to  put 
West  Germany  back  on  the  path  of  growth. 

The  East  German  economy  had  been  a  powerhouse  in  East- 
ern Europe,  where  Moscow  had  relied  on  it  to  produce 
machine  tools,  chemicals,  and  electronics.  But  it  had  grown 
increasingly  inefficient,  and  its  currency  had  become  worthless 
outside  its  own  borders.  East  Germans  had  felt  frustrated  at 
their  lack  of  true  material  well-being,  as  well  as  their  lack  of 
freedom.  They  joined  their  economy  enthusiastically  with  that 
of  West  Germany  in  1990.  The  merger  gave  them  a  rude  shock, 


247 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

however,  in  part  because  of  the  simultaneous  collapse  of  East 
Germany's  markets  in  the  Soviet  empire  and  in  part  because  of 
the  inefficiencies  that  the  communist  system  had  left  behind. 

The  united  German  economy  is  a  dominant  force  in  world 
markets  because  of  the  strong  export  orientation  that  has  been 
part  of  the  German  tradition  for  centuries.  Although  the  bur- 
dens of  unification  have  cut  into  West  Germany's  traditional 
export  surplus,  German  industry  continues  to  produce  some  of 
the  best  machine  tools,  automobiles,  trucks,  chemicals,  and 
engineering  products  in  the  world.  Its  management  culture, 
which  mingles  competition  and  cooperation,  stresses  quality 
and  durability  above  all  other  virtues.  Because  many  German 
companies  are  small  or  medium-sized,  they  are  able  to  concen- 
trate on  a  few  production  lines  that  compete  effectively  even  if 
they  are  expensive. 

The  German  culture  of  cooperation  also  extends  to  the  rela- 
tions between  the  private  sector  and  the  government.  The 
social  market  economy,  in  which  all  elements  of  the  system 
cooperate,  stresses  the  importance  of  having  all  parties  to  the 
social  contract  work  together.  Workers  play  a  role  in  manage- 
ment. Managers  mingle  with  workers.  The  bureaucracy 
attempts  to  create  an  environment  in  which  all  parties  serve  a 
common  purpose.  Although  the  rules  intended  to  prevent  the 
recurrence  of  the  German  cartel  system  of  the  last  century  are 
strictly  enforced  by  the  Bundeskartellamt  (Federal  Cartel 
Office),  certain  practices  that  would  be  forbidden  under 
United  States  antitrust  laws  are  widely  tolerated  in  Germany. 

The  dominant  force  in  the  German  economy  is  the  banking 
system.  The  central  bank,  the  Bundesbank,  is  deeply  commit- 
ted to  maintaining  the  value  of  the  nation's  currency,  the  deut- 
sche  mark,  even  at  some  potential  cost  to  economic  growth.  It 
fears  inflation  above  all  other  ills  and  is  determined  to  prevent 
the  recurrence  of  Germany's  ruinous  Great  Inflation  of  the 
early  1920s.  Private  banks  also  play  an  important  role.  German 
industrial  and  service  companies  rely  much  more  on  bank 
finance  than  on  equity  capital.  The  banks  provide  the  money 
and  in  turn  sit  on  the  supervisory  boards  of  most  of  Germany's 
corporations.  From  that  vantage  point,  they  stress  the  tradi- 
tional banking  virtues  of  slow  but  steady  and  nonrisky  growth. 
Their  influence  and  thinking  permeate  the  economy. 

German  agriculture  is  not  as  strong  as  German  industry.  It  is 
a  relatively  small  part  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see 
Glossary)  and  is  heavily  subsidized  by  the  EU's  Common  Agri- 


248 


The  Domestic  Economy 


cultural  Policy  (CAP — see  Glossary)  and  by  the  German  gov- 
ernment itself.  The  accession  of  East  Germany  to  a  united 
Germany  expanded  the  relative  size  of  the  agricultural  sector 
and  somewhat  improved  its  efficiency,  but  Germany  is  not  an 
agricultural  producer  like  Spain  or  Italy. 

West  Germany  developed  a  system  of  high  wages  and  high 
social  benefits  that  has  been  carried  over  into  united  Germany. 
The  extent  and  the  generosity  of  its  social  programs  now  leave 
Germany  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  with  respect  to  the 
states  of  Eastern  Europe  and  Asia.  German  labor  costs  are 
above  those  of  most  other  states,  not  because  of  the  wages 
themselves — which  are  high  by  global  standards  but  not  out  of 
line  with  German  labor  productivity — but  because  of  social 
costs,  which  impose  burdens  equal  to  the  wages  themselves. 
Thus,  German  companies  and  German  workers  must  decide 
either  to  abandon  some  of  the  social  programs  that  are  at  the 
core  of  the  revered  social  market  economy  or  to  risk  losing  out 
in  the  increasingly  intense  global  competition  of  the  1990s  and 
beyond.  The  Germans  have  not  solved  this  problem,  but  they 
are  beginning  to  address  it  more  seriously  than  before. 

Patterns  of  Development 
History 

Medieval  Germany,  lying  on  the  open  Central  European 
Plain,  was  divided  into  hundreds  of  contending  kingdoms, 
principalities,  dukedoms,  bishoprics,  and  free  cities.  Economic 
survival  in  that  environment,  like  political  or  even  physical  sur- 
vival, did  not  mean  expanding  across  unlimited  terrain,  as  in 
the  United  States.  It  meant  a  constant  struggle  that  required 
collaboration  with  some,  competition  with  others,  and  an  inti- 
mate understanding  among  government,  commerce,  and  pro- 
duction. A  desire  to  save  was  also  born  in  the  German 
experience  of  political,  military,  and  economic  uncertainty. 

Even  under  these  difficult  conditions,  Germany  had  already 
developed  a  strong  economy  during  the  Middle  Ages.  It  was 
based  on  guild  and  craft  production,  but  with  elements  of  mer- 
chant capitalism  and  mercantilism.  The  trade  conducted  by  its 
cities  ranged  far  and  wide  throughout  Europe  in  all  directions, 
and  Germany  as  a  whole  often  had  trade  surpluses  with  neigh- 
boring states.  One  reason  for  these  exports  was  the  sheer 
necessity  for  the  small  states  to  sell  abroad  in  order  to  buy  the 
many  things  they  could  not  produce  at  home. 


249 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

The  German  guilds  of  the  Middle  Ages  established  the  Ger- 
man tradition  of  creating  products  known  for  quality  and  dura- 
bility. A  craftsman  was  not  permitted  to  pursue  a  trade  until  he 
could  demonstrate  the  ability  to  make  high-quality  products. 
Out  of  that  same  tradition  came  an  equally  strong  passion  for 
education  and  vocational  training,  for  no  craftsman  was  recog- 
nized until  he  had  thoroughly  learned  a  trade,  passed  a  test, 
and  been  certified. 

The  Industrial  Revolution  reached  Germany  long  after  it 
had  flowered  in  Britain,  and  the  governments  of  the  German 
states  supported  local  industry  because  they  did  not  want  to  be 
left  behind.  Many  enterprises  were  government  initiated,  gov- 
ernment financed,  government  managed,  or  government  sub- 
sidized. As  industry  grew  and  prospered  in  the  nineteenth 
century,  Prussia  and  other  German  states  consciously  sup- 
ported all  economic  development  and  especially  transporta- 
tion and  industry. 

The  north  German  states  were  for  the  most  part  richer  in 
natural  resources  than  the  southern  states.  They  had  vast  agri- 
cultural tracts  from  Schleswig-Holstein  in  the  west  through 
Prussia  in  the  east.  They  also  had  coal  and  iron  in  the  Ruhr  Val- 
ley. Through  the  practice  of  primogeniture,  widely  followed  in 
northern  Germany,  large  estates  and  fortunes  grew.  So  did 
close  relations  between  their  owners  and  local  as  well  as 
national  governments. 

The  south  German  states  were  relatively  poor  in  natural 
resources  except  for  their  people,  and  those  Germans  there- 
fore engaged  more  often  in  small  economic  enterprises.  They 
also  had  no  primogeniture  rule  but  subdivided  the  land  among 
several  offspring,  leading  those  offspring  to  remain  in  their 
native  towns  but  not  fully  able  to  support  themselves  from  their 
small  parcels  of  land.  The  south  German  states,  therefore,  fos- 
tered cottage  industries,  crafts,  and  a  more  independent  and 
self-reliant  spirit  less  closely  linked  to  the  government. 

German  banks  played  central  roles  in  financing  German 
industry.  They  also  shaped  industrywide  producer  coopera- 
tives, known  as  cartels.  Different  banks  formed  cartels  in  differ- 
ent industries.  Cartel  contracts  were  accepted  as  legal  and 
binding  by  German  courts  although  they  were  held  to  be  illegal 
in  Britain  and  the  United  States. 

The  first  German  cartel  was  a  salt  cartel,  the  Neckar  Salt 
Union  of  1828,  formed  in  Wurttemberg  and  Baden.  The  pro- 
cess of  cartelization  began  slowly,  but  the  cartel  movement  took 


250 


The  Domestic  Economy 


hold  after  1873  in  the  economic  depression  that  followed  the 
postunification  speculative  bubble.  It  began  in  heavy  industry 
and  spread  throughout  other  industries.  By  1900  there  were 
275  cartels  in  operation;  by  1908,  over  500.  By  some  estimates, 
different  cartel  arrangements  may  have  numbered  in  the  thou- 
sands at  different  times,  but  many  German  companies  stayed 
outside  the  cartels  because  they  did  not  welcome  the  restric- 
tions that  membership  imposed. 

The  government  played  a  powerful  role  in  the  industrializa- 
tion of  the  German  Empire  founded  by  Otto  von  Bismarck  in 
1871  (see  Bismarck  and  Unification,  ch.  1).  It  supported  not 
only  heavy  industry  but  also  crafts  and  trades  because  it  wanted 
to  maintain  prosperity  in  all  parts  of  the  empire.  Even  where 
the  national  government  did  not  act,  the  highly  autonomous 
regional  and  local  governments  supported  their  own  indus- 
tries. Each  state  tried  to  be  as  self-sufficient  as  possible. 

Despite  the  several  ups  and  downs  of  prosperity  and  depres- 
sion that  marked  the  first  decades  of  the  German  Empire,  the 
ultimate  wealth  of  the  empire  proved  immense.  German  aristo- 
crats, landowners,  bankers,  and  producers  created  what  might 
be  termed  the  first  German  economic  miracle,  the  turn-of-the- 
century  surge  in  German  industry  and  commerce  during 
which  bankers,  industrialists,  mercantilists,  the  military,  and 
the  monarchy  joined  forces. 

The  German  Empire  also  established,  under  Bismarck's 
direction,  the  social  compact  under  which  the  German  labor- 
ing classes  supported  the  national  ambitions  of  the  newly 
united  German  state  in  exchange  for  a  system  of  social  welfare 
that  would  make  them,  if  not  full  participants  in  the  system,  at 
least  its  beneficiaries  and  pensioners.  Bismarck  was  not  a  social- 
ist, but  he  believed  that  it  was  necessary  to  accept  portions  of 
the  socialist  platform  to  sustain  prosperity  and  social  cohesion. 

From  the  prosperity  of  the  empire  during  the  Wilhelmine 
era  (1890-1914),  Germany  plunged  into  World  War  I,  a  war  it 
was  to  lose  and  one  that  spawned  many  of  the  economic  crises 
that  would  destroy  the  successor  Weimar  Republic  (see  The 
Weimar  Republic,  1918-33,  ch.  1).  Even  the  British  economist 
John  Maynard  Keynes  denounced  the  1919  Treaty  of  Versailles 
as  ruinous  to  German  and  global  prosperity.  The  war  and  the 
treaty  were  followed  by  the  Great  Inflation  of  the  early  1920s 
that  wreaked  havoc  on  Germany's  social  structure  and  political 
stability.  During  that  inflation,  the  value  of  the  nation's  cur- 
rency, the  Reichsmark,  collapsed  from  8.9  per  US$1  in  1918  to 


251 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

4.2  trillion  per  US$1  by  November  1923.  Then,  after  a  brief 
period  of  prosperity  during  the  mid-1920s,  came  the  Great 
Depression,  which  destroyed  what  remained  of  the  German 
middle  class  and  paved  the  way  for  the  dictatorship  of  Adolf 
Hitler.  During  the  Hitler  era  (1933-45),  the  economy  devel- 
oped a  hothouse  prosperity,  supported  with  high  government 
subsidies  to  those  sectors  that  Hitler  favored  because  they  gave 
Germany  military  power  and  economic  autarchy,  that  is,  eco- 
nomic independence  from  the  global  economy.  Finally,  the 
entire  enterprise  collapsed  in  the  Stunde  Null  (Zero  Hour), 
when  Germany  lay  in  ruins  at  the  end  of  World  War  II  in  May 
1945  and  when  every  German  knew  that  he  or  she  had  to  begin 
life  all  over  again. 

The  first  several  years  after  World  War  II  were  years  of  bitter 
penury  for  the  Germans.  Their  land,  their  homes,  and  their 
property  lay  in  ruin.  Millions  were  forced  to  flee  with  nothing 
but  the  clothes  on  their  backs.  Tens  of  millions  did  not  have 
enough  to  eat  or  to  wear.  Inflation  raged.  Parker  pens,  nylon 
stockings,  and  Camel  cigarettes  represented  the  accepted,  if 
not  the  legal,  tender  of  the  time.  Occupation  projections 
showed  that  the  average  German  would  be  able  to  purchase  a 
plate  every  five  years,  a  pair  of  shoes  every  twelve  years,  and  a 
suit  every  fifty  years. 

As  Germany's  postwar  economic  and  political  leaders  shaped 
their  plans  for  the  future  German  economy,  they  saw  in  ruin  a 
new  beginning,  an  opportunity  to  position  Germany  on  a  new 
and  totally  different  path.  The  economy  was  to  be  an  instru- 
ment for  prosperity,  but  it  was  also  to  safeguard  democracy  and 
to  help  maintain  a  stable  society.  The  new  German  leaders 
wanted  social  peace  as  well  as  economic  prosperity.  They 
wanted  an  economic  system  that  would  give  all  an  equal  oppor- 
tunity in  order  to  avoid  creating  underprivileged  social  groups 
whose  bitter  frustration  would  erupt  into  revolution  and — in 
turn — repression. 

The  man  who  took  full  advantage  of  Germany's  postwar 
opportunity  was  Ludwig  Erhard,  who  was  determined  to  shape 
a  new  and  different  kind  of  German  economy.  He  was  given  his 
chance  by  United  States  officials,  who  found  him  working  in 
Nuremberg  and  who  saw  that  many  of  his  ideas  coincided  with 
their  own. 

Erhard's  first  step  was  currency  reform:  the  abolition  of  the 
Reichsmark  and  the  creation  of  a  new  currency,  the  deutsche 
mark.  He  carried  out  that  reform  on  June  20,  1948,  installing 


252 


The  Domestic  Economy 


the  new  currency  with  the  concurrence  of  the  Western  Allies 
but  also  taking  advantage  of  the  opportunity  to  abolish  most 
Nazi  and  occupation  rules  and  regulations  in  order  to  establish 
the  genesis  of  a  free  economy.  The  currency  reform,  whose 
purpose  was  to  provide  a  respected  store  of  value  and  a  widely 
accepted  legal  tender,  succeeded  brilliantly.  It  established  the 
foundations  of  the  West  German  economy  and  of  the  West  Ger- 
man state. 

The  Social  Market  Economy 

The  Germans  proudly  label  their  economy  a  " soziale  Markt- 
wirtschaft,"  or  "social  market  economy,"  to  show  that  the  system 
as  it  has  developed  after  World  War  II  has  both  a  material  and  a 
social — or  human — dimension.  They  stress  the  importance  of 
the  term  "market"  because  after  the  Nazi  experience  they 
wanted  an  economy  free  of  state  intervention  and  domination. 
The  only  state  role  in  the  new  West  German  economy  was  to 
protect  the  competitive  environment  from  monopolistic  or  oli- 
gopolistic tendencies — including  its  own.  The  term  "social"  is 
stressed  because  West  Germans  wanted  an  economy  that  would 
not  only  help  the  wealthy  but  also  care  for  the  workers  and  oth- 
ers who  might  not  prove  able  to  cope  with  the  strenuous  com- 
petitive demands  of  a  market  economy.  The  term  "social"  was 
chosen  rather  than  "socialist"  to  distinguish  their  system  from 
those  in  which  the  state  claimed  the  right  to  direct  the  econ- 
omy or  to  intervene  in  it. 

Beyond  these  principles  of  the  social  market  economy,  but 
linked  to  it,  comes  a  more  traditional  German  concept,  that  of 
Ordnung,  which  can  be  directly  translated  to  mean  order  but 
which  really  means  an  economy,  society,  and  polity  that  are 
structured  but  not  dictatorial.  The  founders  of  the  social  mar- 
ket economy  insisted  that  Denken  in  Ordnungen — to  think  in 
terms  of  systems  of  order — was  essential.  They  also  spoke  of 
Ordo-Liberalismus  because  the  essence  of  the  concept  is  that  this 
must  be  a  freely  chosen  order,  not  a  command  order. 

Over  time,  the  term  "social"  in  the  social  market  economy 
began  to  take  on  a  life  of  its  own.  It  moved  the  West  German 
economy  toward  an  extensive  social  welfare  system  that  has 
become  one  of  the  most  expensive  in  the  world.  Moreover,  the 
West  German  federal  government  and  the  states  {Lander,  sing., 
Land)  began  to  compensate  for  irregularities  in  economic 
cycles  and  for  shifts  in  world  production  by  beginning  to  shel- 
ter and  support  some  sectors  and  industries.  In  an  even  greater 


253 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

departure  from  the  Erhard  tradition,  the  government  became 
an  instrument  for  the  preservation  of  existing  industries  rather 
than  a  force  for  renewal.  In  the  1970s,  the  state  assumed  an 
ever  more  important  role  in  the  economy.  During  the  1980s, 
Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl  tried  to  reduce  that  state  role,  and  he 
succeeded  in  part,  but  German  unification  again  compelled 
the  German  government  to  assume  a  stronger  role  in  the  econ- 
omy. Thus,  the  contradiction  between  the  terms  "social"  and 
"market"  has  remained  an  element  for  debate  in  Germany. 

Given  the  internal  contradiction  in  its  philosophy,  the  Ger- 
man economy  is  both  conservative  and  dynamic.  It  is  conserva- 
tive in  the  sense  that  it  draws  on  the  part  of  the  German 
tradition  that  envisages  some  state  role  in  the  economy  and  a 
cautious  attitude  toward  investment  and  risk-taking.  It  is 
dynamic  in  the  sense  that  it  is  directed  toward  growth — even  if 
that  growth  may  be  slow  and  steady  rather  than  spectacular.  It 
tries  to  combine  the  virtues  of  a  market  system  with  the  virtues 
of  a  social  welfare  system. 

The  Economic  Miracle  and  Beyond 

The  economic  reforms  and  the  new  West  German  system 
received  powerful  support  from  a  number  of  sources:  invest- 
ment funds  under  the  European  Recovery  Program,  more 
commonly  known  as  the  Marshall  Plan;  the  stimulus  to  German 
industry  provided  by  the  diversion  of  other  Western  resources 
for  Korean  War  production;  and  the  German  readiness  to  work 
hard  for  low  wages  until  productivity  had  risen.  But  the  essen- 
tial component  of  success  was  the  revival  of  confidence 
brought  on  by  Erhard's  reforms  and  by  the  new  currency. 

The  West  German  boom  that  began  in  1950  was  truly  memo- 
rable. The  growth  rate  of  industrial  production  was  25.0  per- 
cent in  1950  and  18.1  percent  in  1951.  Growth  continued  at  a 
high  rate  for  most  of  the  1950s,  despite  occasional  slowdowns. 
By  1960  industrial  production  had  risen  to  two-and-one-half 
times  the  level  of  1950  and  far  beyond  any  that  the  Nazis  had 
reached  during  the  1930s  in  all  of  Germany  GDP  rose  by  two- 
thirds  during  the  same  decade.  The  number  of  persons 
employed  rose  from  13.8  million  in  1950  to  19.8  million  in 
1960,  and  the  unemployment  rate  fell  from  10.3  percent  to  1.2 
percent. 

Labor  also  benefited  in  due  course  from  the  boom. 
Although  wage  demands  and  pay  increases  had  been  modest  at 
first,  wages  and  salaries  rose  over  80  percent  between  1949  and 


254 


The  Domestic  Economy 


1955,  catching  up  with  growth.  West  German  social  programs 
were  given  a  considerable  boost  in  1957,  just  before  a  national 
election,  when  the  government  decided  to  initiate  a  number  of 
social  programs  and  to  expand  others. 

In  1957  West  Germany  gained  a  new  central  bank,  the 
Deutsche  Bundesbank,  generally  called  simply  the  Bundes- 
bank, which  succeeded  the  Bank  Deutscher  Lander  and  was 
given  much  more  authority  over  monetary  policy.  That  year 
also  saw  the  establishment  of  the  Bundeskartellamt  (Federal 
Cartel  Office),  designed  to  prevent  the  return  of  German 
monopolies  and  cartels.  Six  years  later,  in  1963,  the  Bundestag, 
the  lower  house  of  Germany's  parliament,  at  Erhard's  urging 
established  the  Council  of  Economic  Experts  to  provide  objec- 
tive evaluations  on  which  to  base  German  economic  policy. 

The  West  German  economy  did  not  grow  as  fast  or  as  consis- 
tently in  the  1960s  as  it  had  during  the  1950s,  in  part  because 
such  a  torrid  pace  could  not  be  sustained,  in  part  because  the 
supply  of  fresh  labor  from  East  Germany  was  cut  off  by  the  Ber- 
lin Wall,  built  in  1961,  and  in  part  because  the  Bundesbank 
became  disturbed  about  potential  overheating  and  moved  sev- 
eral times  to  slow  the  pace  of  growth.  Erhard,  who  had  suc- 
ceeded Konrad  Adenauer  as  chancellor,  was  voted  out  of  office 
in  December  1966,  largely — although  not  entirely — because  of 
the  economic  problems  of  the  Federal  Republic.  He  was 
replaced  by  the  Grand  Coalition  consisting  of  the  Christian 
Democratic  Union  (Christlich  Demokratische  Union — CDU), 
its  sister  party  the  Christian  Social  Union  (Christlich-Soziale 
Union — CSU),  and  the  Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany 
(Sozialdemokratische  Partei  Deutschlands — SPD)  under  Chan- 
cellor Kurt  Georg  Kiesinger  of  the  CDU. 

Under  the  pressure  of  the  slowdown,  the  new  West  German 
Grand  Coalition  government  abandoned  Erhard's  broad  lais- 
sez-faire orientation.  The  new  minister  for  economics,  Karl 
Schiller,  argued  strongly  for  legislation  that  would  give  the  fed- 
eral government  and  his  ministry  greater  authority  to  guide 
economic  policy.  In  1967  the  Bundestag  passed  the  Law  for 
Promoting  Stability  and  Growth,  known  as  the  Magna  Carta  of 
medium-term  economic  management.  That  law,  which 
remains  in  effect  although  never  again  applied  as  energetically 
as  in  Schiller's  time,  provided  for  coordination  of  federal, 
Land,  and  local  budget  plans  in  order  to  give  fiscal  policy  a 
stronger  impact.  The  law  also  set  a  number  of  optimistic  targets 
for  the  four  basic  standards  by  which  West  German  economic 


255

success  was  henceforth  to  be  measured:  currency  stability,  eco- 
nomic growth,  employment  levels,  and  trade  balance.  Those 
standards  became  popularly  known  as  the  magisches  Viereck,  the 
"magic  rectangle"  or  the  "magic  polygon." 

Schiller  followed  a  different  concept  from  Erhard's.  He  was 
one  of  the  rare  German  Keynesians,  and  he  brought  to  his  new 
tasks  the  unshakable  conviction  that  government  had  both  the 
obligation  and  the  capacity  to  shape  economic  trends  and  to 
smooth  out  and  even  eliminate  the  business  cycle.  Schiller's 
chosen  formula  was  Globalsteuerung,  or  global  guidance,  a  pro- 
cess by  which  government  would  not  intervene  in  the  details  of 
the  economy  but  would  establish  broad  guidelines  that  would 
foster  uninterrupted  noninflationary  growth. 

Schiller's  success  in  the  Grand  Coalition  helped  to  give  the 
SPD  an  electoral  victory  in  1969  and  a  chance  to  form  a  new 
coalition  government  with  the  Free  Democratic  Party  (Freie 
Demokratische  Partei— FDP)  under  Willy  Brandt.  The  SPD- 
FDP  coalition  expanded  the  West  German  social  security  sys- 
tem, substantially  increasing  the  size  and  cost  of  the  social  bud- 
get. Social  program  costs  grew  by  over  10  percent  a  year  during 
much  of  the  1970s,  introducing  into  the  budget  an  unalterable 
obligation  that  reduced  fiscal  flexibility  (although  Schiller  and 
other  Keynesians  believed  that  it  would  have  an  anticyclical 
effect) .  This  came  back  to  haunt  Schiller  as  well  as  every  Ger- 
man government  since  then.  Schiller  himself  had  to  resign  in 
1972  when  the  West  German  and  global  economies  were  in  a 
downturn  and  when  all  his  ideas  did  not  seem  able  to  revive 
West  German  prosperity.  Willy  Brandt  himself  resigned  two 
years  later. 

Helmut  Schmidt,  Brandt's  successor,  was  intensely  interested 
in  economics  but  also  faced  great  problems,  including  the  dra- 
matic upsurge  in  oil  prices  of  1973-74.  West  Germany's  GDP  in 
1975  fell  by  1.4  percent  (in  constant  prices),  the  first  time  since 
the  founding  of  the  FRG  that  it  had  fallen  so  sharply.  The  West 
German  trade  balance  also  fell  as  global  demand  declined  and 
as  the  terms  of  trade  deteriorated  because  of  the  rise  in  petro- 
leum prices. 

By  1976  the  worst  was  over.  West  German  growth  resumed, 
and  the  inflation  rate  began  to  decline  (see  table  12,  Appen- 
dix). Although  neither  reached  the  favorable  levels  that  had 
come  to  be  taken  for  granted  during  the  1950s  and  early  1960s, 
they  were  accepted  as  tolerable  after  the  turbulence  of  the  pre- 
vious years.  Schmidt  began  to  be  known  as  a  Macher  (achiever), 


256 


The  Domestic  Economy 


and  the  government  won  reelection  in  1976.  Schmidt's  success 
led  him  and  his  party  to  claim  that  they  had  built  Modell 
Deutschland  (the  German  model). 

But  the  economy  again  turned  down  and,  despite  efforts  to 
stimulate  growth  by  government  deficits,  failed  to  revive 
quickly.  It  was  only  by  mid-1978  that  Schmidt  and  the  Bundes- 
bank were  able  to  bring  the  economy  into  balance.  After  that, 
the  economy  continued  expanding  through  1979  and  much  of 
1980,  helping  Schmidt  win  reelection  in  1980.  But  the  upturn 
proved  to  be  uneven  and  unrewarding,  as  the  problems  of  the 
mid-1970s  rapidly  returned.  By  early  1981,  Schmidt  faced  the 
worst  possible  situation:  growth  fell  and  unemployment  rose, 
but  inflation  did  not  abate. 

By  the  fall  of  1982,  Schmidt's  coalition  government  col- 
lapsed as  the  FDP  withdrew  to  join  a  coalition  led  by  Helmut 
Kohl,  the  leader  of  the  CDU/CSU.  He  began  to  direct  what  was 
termed  die  Wende  (the  turning  or  the  reversal).  The  govern- 
ment proceeded  to  implement  new  policies  to  reduce  the  gov- 
ernment role  in  the  economy  and  within  a  year  won  a  popular 
vote  in  support  of  the  new  course. 

Within  its  broad  policy,  the  new  government  had  several 
main  objectives:  to  reduce  the  federal  deficit  by  cutting  expen- 
ditures as  well  as  taxes,  to  reduce  government  restrictions  and 
regulations,  and  to  improve  the  flexibility  and  performance  of 
the  labor  market.  The  government  also  carried  through  a 
series  of  privatization  measures,  selling  almost  DM10  billion 
(for  value  of  the  deutsche  mark — see  Glossary)  in  shares  of 
such  diverse  state-owned  institutions  as  VEBA,  VIAG,  Volks- 
wagen, Lufthansa,  and  Salzgitter.  Through  all  these  steps,  the 
state  role  in  the  West  German  economy  declined  from  52  per- 
cent to  46  percent  of  GDP  between  1982  and  1990,  according 
to  Bundesbank  statistics. 

Although  the  policies  of  die  Wende  changed  the  mood  of  the 
West  German  economy  and  reinstalled  a  measure  of  confi- 
dence, progress  came  unevenly  and  haltingly.  During  most  of 
the  1980s,  the  figures  on  growth  and  inflation  improved  but 
slowly,  and  the  figures  on  unemployment  barely  moved  at  all. 
There  was  little  job  growth  until  the  end  of  the  decade.  When 
the  statistics  did  change,  however,  even  modestly,  it  was  at  least 
in  the  right  direction. 

Nonetheless,  it  also  remained  true  that  West  German  growth 
did  not  again  reach  the  levels  that  it  had  attained  in  the  early 
years  of  the  Federal  Republic.  There  had  been  a  decline  in  the 


257 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 


growth  rate  since  the  1950s,  an  upturn  in  unemployment  since 
the  1960s,  and  a  gradual  increase  in  inflation  except  during  or 
after  a  severe  downturn. 

Global  economic  statistics  also  showed  a  decline  in  West  Ger- 
man output  and  vitality.  They  showed  that  the  West  German 
share  of  total  world  production  had  grown  from  6.6  percent  in 
1965  to  7.9  percent  by  1975.  Twelve  years  later,  in  1987,  how- 
ever, it  had  fallen  to  7.4  percent,  largely  because  of  the  more 
rapid  growth  of  Japan  and  other  Asian  states.  Even  adding  the 
estimated  GDP  of  the  former  East  Germany  at  its  peak  before 
unification  would  not  have  brought  the  all-German  share 
above  8.2  percent  by  1989  and  would  leave  all  of  Germany  with 
barely  a  greater  share  of  world  production  than  West  Germany 
alone  had  reached  fifteen  years  earlier. 

It  was  only  in  the  late  1980s  that  West  Germany's  economy 
finally  began  to  grow  more  rapidly.  The  growth  rate  for  West 
German  GDP  rose  to  3.7  percent  in  1988  and  3.6  percent  in 
1989,  the  highest  levels  of  the  decade.  The  unemployment  rate 
also  fell  to  7.6  percent  in  1989,  despite  an  influx  of  workers 
from  abroad.  Thus,  the  results  of  the  late  1980s  appeared  to 
vindicate  the  West  German  supply-side  revolution.  Tax  rate 
reductions  had  led  to  greater  vitality  and  revenues.  Although 
the  cumulative  public-sector  deficit  had  gone  above  the  DM1 
trillion  level,  the  public  sector  was  growing  more  slowly  than 
before. 

The  year  1989  was  the  last  year  of  the  West  German  economy 
as  a  separate  and  separable  institution.  From  1990  the  positive 
and  negative  distortions  generated  by  German  unification  set 
in,  and  the  West  German  economy  began  to  reorient  itself 
toward  economic  and  political  union  with  what  had  been  East 
Germany.  The  economy  turned  gradually  and  massively  from 
its  primarily  West  European  and  global  orientation  toward  an 
increasingly  intense  concentration  on  the  requirements  and 
the  opportunities  of  unification. 

Unification  and  Its  Aftermath 

The  East  German  and  West  German  economies  at  the  time 
of  unification  looked  very  similar.  They  both  concentrated  on 
industrial  production,  especially  machine  tools,  chemicals, 
automobiles,  and  precision  manufactures.  Both  had  a  well- 
trained  labor  force  and  an  important  export  component, 
although  their  exports  went  largely  in  opposite  directions.  But 
the  East  German  economy  was  highly  centralized  and  guided 


258 


The  Domestic  Economy 


by  a  detailed  and  purportedly  precise  planning  system,  with  vir- 
tually no  private  property  and  with  no  room  for  decision  or  ini- 
tiative. 

On  July  1,  1990,  the  economies  of  the  two  Germanys  became 
one.  It  was  the  first  time  in  history  that  a  capitalist  and  a  social- 
ist economy  had  suddenly  become  one,  and  there  were  no  pre- 
cise guidelines  on  how  it  could  be  done.  Instead,  there  were  a 
number  of  problems,  of  which  the  most  severe  were  the  com- 
paratively poor  productivity  of  the  former  East  German  econ- 
omy and  its  links  to  the  collapsing  socialist  economies  of  the 
Soviet  Union  and  Eastern  Europe. 

Even  before  economic  unification,  the  West  German  govern- 
ment had  decided  that  one  of  its  first  tasks  was  to  privatize  the 
East  German  economy.  For  this  reason,  it  had  taken  over  in 
June  the  Treuhandanstalt  (Trust  Agency,  commonly  known  as 
Treuhand),  which  had  been  established  by  the  GDR  to  take 
over  East  German  firms  and  to  turn  them  over  to  new  manage- 
ment through  privatization.  The  agency  assumed  the  assets  and 
liabilities  of  about  8,000  East  German  enterprises  in  order  to 
sell  them  to  German  and  other  bidders.  By  the  time  the  Treu- 
hand was  disbanded  at  the  end  of  1994,  it  had  privatized  some 
14,000  enterprises. 

As  economic  unification  proceeded,  issues  that  had  been 
recognized  but  inadequately  understood  in  advance  began  to 
surface.  There  was  massive  confusion  about  property  rights.  As 
wave  after  wave  of  Nazi,  Soviet,  and  later  GDR  expropriations 
had  taken  place  between  1933  and  1989,  there  was  often  little 
knowledge  of  the  actual  ownership  of  property.  More  than  2 
million  claims  on  properties  in  the  territory  of  the  former  GDR 
were  filed  by  the  December  31,  1992,  deadline.  As  more  claim- 
ants emerged,  with  many  winning  cases  in  the  courts,  potential 
investors  were  often  scared  off. 

Another  problem  was  that  East  German  production  costs 
had  been  very  high.  The  conversion  rates  of  East  German 
marks  to  deutsche  marks  often  kept  those  costs  high,  as  did  the 
early  wage  negotiations,  which  resulted  in  wages  far  above  the 
productivity  level.  Western  German  firms  found  it  easier  and 
cheaper  to  serve  their  new  eastern  German  markets  by  expand- 
ing production  in  western  facilities. 

A  third  problem  was  that  the  inadequate  infrastructure  also 
became  a  problem  for  many  potential  investors.  Telephone  ser- 
vice was  improved  only  very  slowly.  Many  investors  also  com- 
plained about  energy  shortages,  as  many  East  German  power

stations  were  shut  down  for  safety  and  other  reasons.  Roads 
and  railroads  had  to  be  virtually  rebuilt  because  they  had  been 
so  badly  maintained. 

In  addition  to  these  practical  problems,  there  was  also  a 
deep  policy  dilemma  that  underlay  the  entire  process  of  unifi- 
cation. From  the  beginning,  there  had  been  a  pernicious  link 
between  the  earlier  and  later  phases  of  the  East  German  transi- 
tion to  a  free-market  economy.  Policies  calculated  to  make  the 
initial  adjustment  as  painless  as  possible  hampered  long-run 
growth  and  prosperity.  Real  economic  efficiency  could  only  be 
achieved  by  permitting  and  even  forcing  considerable  immedi- 
ate dislocations,  whereas  temporary  compromises  might  lead 
to  permanent  structural  burdens.  However,  excessive  disrup- 
tions could  jeopardize  the  economic  and  political  stability 
required  for  a  smooth  unification  process  and  might  also  cause 
streams  of  East  Germans  to  move  west.  The  government  was 
never  able  to  solve  this  dilemma.  When  it  was  forced  to  choose, 
it  usually  selected  the  more  expensive  and  slower  course  to 
encourage  persons  to  stay  in  the  east. 

Despite  these  problems,  the  process  of  unification  moved 
ahead,  albeit  slowly.  The  Treuhand,  staffed  almost  entirely  by 
Germans  from  the  west,  became  the  virtual  government  of  east- 
ern Germany.  In  the  course  of  privatization,  the  agency 
decided  which  companies  would  live  and  which  would  die, 
which  communities  would  thrive  and  which  would  shrivel,  and 
which  eastern  Lander  would  be  prosperous  and  which  would 
not.  It  also  decided  who  might  or  might  not  buy  eastern  firms 
or  services. 

Whether  correct  or  not,  reports  persisted  throughout  the 
first  years  of  unification  that  foreign  enterprises  were  being 
screened  more  carefully  and  more  skeptically  than  German 
firms  even  as  they  were  being  invited  to  invest.  Less  than  5  per- 
cent of  all  investment  in  eastern  Germany  was  non-German, 
and  most  of  that  was  from  companies  with  subsidiaries  in  west- 
ern Germany  who  were  expanding  them  to  the  east.  The  Japa- 
nese did  not  invest,  although  they  had  earlier  expressed  some 
interest,  and  the  offices  Treuhand  established  in  New  York  and 
Tokyo  found  few  investors. 

As  might  have  been  expected,  the  economy  of  eastern  Ger- 
many went  into  a  deep  and  precipitous  slump  immediately 
after  unification.  Within  a  year  after  unification,  the  number  of 
unemployed  rose  above  3  million.  Industrial  production  in 
eastern  Germany  fell  to  less  than  half  the  previous  rate,  and  the 


260 


The  Domestic  Economy 


total  regional  product  fell  precipitously  through  1991.  One 
estimate  was  that  in  1991  the  entire  production  of  eastern  Ger- 
many amounted  to  less  than  8  percent  of  that  of  western  Ger- 
many. 

Because  the  process  of  unification  was  managed  by  persons 
from  western  Germany,  new  eastern  firms  were  usually  subsid- 
iaries of  western  firms,  and  they  followed  the  western  owner- 
ship and  management  patterns.  Bank  participation  became 
customary,  especially  because  the  large  Frankfurt  banks 
assumed  the  assets  of  the  former  East  German  State  Bank,  and 
most  eastern  firms  thus  owed  money  to  those  Frankfurt  banks. 
The  banks  installed  their  representatives  on  the  boards  of  the 
new  firms  and  assumed  some  supervisory  functions — either 
directly  or  through  control  by  western  firms  with  bank  repre- 
sentation. The  Treuhand  had  close  contacts  with  western  Ger- 
man banks.  Many  of  its  employees  came  from  those  banks  and 
planned  to  return  to  their  jobs  at  the  banks. 

Because  of  these  circumstances,  private  investment  and  eco- 
nomic growth  came  to  eastern  Germany  at  a  relatively  slow 
rate.  Little  new  equity  capital  flowed  in.  Investment  during  the 
early  years  of  unification  was  only  1  percent  of  the  all-German 
GDP,  when  much  more  was  needed  to  jump-start  the  economy 
of  eastern  Germany.  Much  of  the  investment  was  for  the  pur- 
chase of  eastern  German  companies,  not  yet  for  their  rehabili- 
tation. Many  western  German  firms  bought  eastern  firms  on  a 
standby  basis,  making  sure  they  could  produce  in  the  east  when 
the  time  came  and  paying  enough  wages  to  satisfy  the  Treu- 
hand but  not  starting  production.  Many  others,  including 
Daimler-Benz,  did  not  even  meet  the  commitments  that  they 
had  made  when  they  had  purchased  the  eastern  German  firms 
from  the  Treuhand.  Thus,  western  German  private  investment 
was  not  strong  enough  to  boost  the  eastern  German  economy. 

As  private  funds  lagged,  and  in  part  because  those  funds 
lagged,  federal  budget  investments  and  expenditures  began 
flowing  into  eastern  Germany  at  a  consistently  high  rate.  Gov- 
ernment funds  were  used  essentially  for  two  purposes:  infra- 
structure investment  projects  (roads,  bridges,  railroads,  and  so 
on),  and  income  maintenance  (unemployment  compensation, 
social  security,  and  other  social  costs).  The  infrastructure 
projects  sustained  employment  levels,  and  the  income  mainte- 
nance programs  sustained  income.  But  neither  had  an  early 
growth  payoff.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Although  the  precise  level  of  German  official  expenditures 
in  eastern  Germany  has  been  difficult  to  estimate  because 
funds  appropriated  in  one  year  might  have  been  spent  in 
another,  it  is  beyond  dispute  that  the  federal  government 
expended  well  over  DM350  billion  in  eastern  Germany  during 
the  first  three  years  after  economic,  or  monetary,  unification. 
After  1992  this  requirement  has  continued  at  an  annual  level  of 
around  DM150  billion,  so  that  the  sum  of  private  and  public 
funds  put  into  eastern  Germany  during  the  half-decade 
between  monetary  unification  in  1990  and  the  end  of  1995 
would  probably  amount  to  at  least  DM750  billion  and  perhaps 
as  much  as  DM850  billion.  Between  one-fifth  and  one-fourth  of 
those  funds  were  private,  and  the  remainder  were  government 
funds.  This  constituted  an  infusion  of  outside  money  of  about 
DM50,000  for  every  resident  of  eastern  Germany,  a  far  greater 
level  of  assistance  than  contemplated  for  any  other  area  that 
had  been  behind  the  Iron  Curtain  and  a  token  of  German 
determination  to  bring  eastern  Germany  to  western  levels  as 
quickly  as  possible. 

As  eastern  Germany  went  into  a  deep  recession  during  the 
first  phase  of  unification,  the  western  German  economy  went 
into  a  small  boom.  Western  German  GDP  grew  at  a  rate  of  4.6 
percent  for  1990,  reflecting  the  new  demand  from  eastern  Ger- 
many. The  highest  growth  rate  came  during  the  second  half  of 
1990,  but  growth  continued  at  only  a  slightly  slower  pace  into 
early  1991.  Prices,  however,  remained  relatively  stable  because 
the  cost  of  living  grew  at  only  2.8  percent  despite  some  high 
wage  settlements  in  some  industries.  Employment  rose  during 
the  year,  from  28.0  million  to  28.7  million,  and  the  unemploy- 
ment rate  sank  to  7.2  percent.  Notably,  the  number  of  regis- 
tered unemployed  in  western  Germany  only  declined  by  about 
300,000,  showing  that  at  least  half  of  the  new  jobs  in  western 
Germany  had  been  taken  by  persons  who  had  moved  to  or 
were  commuting  from  eastern  Germany. 

The  dramatic  improvement  in  the  western  German  figures 
resulted  from  the  opening  in  eastern  Germany  of  a  large  new 
market  of  16  million  persons  and  the  simultaneous  availability 
of  many  new  workers  from  eastern  Germany.  Many  easterners 
did  not  want  the  shoddy  goods  produced  at  home,  preferring 
western  consumer  products  and  food.  Moreover,  many  eastern- 
ers were  coming  to  the  west  to  work.  By  the  end  of  1990,  as 
many  as  250,000  were  commuting  to  work  in  the  west,  and  that

number  was  estimated  to  have  grown  to  350,000  or  even 
400,000  by  the  middle  of  1991. 

This  meant  that  western  Germany  not  only  had  a  vast  new 
market  but  also  a  growth  of  over  1  percent  in  its  workforce,  as 
sharp  an  increase  as  since  the  days  of  the  economic  miracle.  It 
also  increased  its  capital  base  because  eastern  German  deposits 
were  placed  in  western  German  banks  that  had  come  east  and 
because  those  deposits  moved  back  to  the  central  German 
financial  market  at  Frankfurt. 

The  Bundesbank  became  worried  about  three  elements  of 
the  sudden  boom:  the  sudden  financial  shifts  between  east  and 
west,  which  led  to  a  jump  in  money  supply;  government  deficits 
resulting  from  large  expenditures  in  eastern  Germany;  and  the 
potentially  inflationary  effects  of  a  rapid  growth  rate  in  the 
west.  The  bank  warned  that  interest  rates  would  have  to  remain 
high  to  keep  price  increases  under  control.  The  bank  raised 


263 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

short-term  interest  rates  sharply  through  1991  and  1992,  with 
the  average  rate  of  short-term  interest  climbing  from  7.1  per- 
cent in  1989  to  8.5  percent  in  1990,  to  9.2  percent  in  1991,  and 
to  9.5  percent  in  1992.  The  Bundesbank  permitted  rates  to 
begin  falling  only  in  1993 — to  7.3  percent — when  it  believed 
that  the  inflationary  pressures  had  been  contained  by  the 
recessionary  effects  of  the  credit  squeeze. 

As  the  Bundesbank's  policies  began  to  take  hold,  growth 
slowed  in  western  Germany,  from  4.2  percent  in  the  first  quar- 
ter of  1991  to  0.8  percent  in  the  last  quarter  of  1992.  For  all  of 
1992,  the  western  German  growth  rate  was  1.5  percent,  a 
decline  from  the  3.7  percent  rate  of  1991  and  even  more  from 
the  4.6  percent  rate  of  1990.  The  eastern  German  growth  rate 
was  6.1  percent  during  1992,  well  below  the  7  percent  to  10 
percent  growth  rate  originally  anticipated  for  the  region.  The 
number  of  employed  in  western  Germany  fell  for  the  first  time 
in  ten  years,  by  89,000  persons. 

Despite  the  slowdown,  during  1992  the  German  economy 
reached  a  milestone  of  sorts.  With  the  addition  of  eastern  Ger- 
man production,  Germany's  GDP  rose  for  the  first  time  above 
DM3  trillion.  Of  that  total,  the  new  Lander  contributed  a  gross 
regional  product  of  DM231  billion,  or  7.7  percent.  However, 
the  total  of  German  unemployed  also  reached  a  record  num- 
ber, 4  million.  Two-thirds  of  that  number  were  unemployed  in 
western  Germany;  the  other  one-third  were  unemployed  in 
eastern  Germany.  Eastern  Germany  contributed  more  to 
unemployment  than  to  production. 

The  1992  depression  continued  into  1993,  so  that  the  econ- 
omy actually  registered  a  negative  growth  rate  of  -1.2  percent. 
By  1994,  however,  after  the  Bundesbank  had  been  lowering 
short-term  interest  rates  for  over  a  year,  German  growth 
resumed  at  an  annual  rate  of  about  2.4  percent,  but  unemploy- 
ment declined  only  very  slowly  despite  the  uptrend  in  GDP 
growth.  It  was  expected  that  stronger  growth  would  begin 
reducing  the  numbers  of  unemployed  by  1995  and  that  Ger- 
many would  return  to  its  postwar  path  toward  prosperity.  But 
the  absorption  of  eastern  Germany,  and  the  methods  by  which 
it  had  been  accomplished,  had  exacted  a  high  price  through- 
out all  of  Germany. 

Structural  and  Technological  Questions 

Although  Germany  is  one  of  the  world's  most  powerful  econ- 
omies, there  have  been  growing  doubts  within  Germany  about 


264 


The  Domestic  Economy 


the  state  of  its  economy.  The  principal  doubts  have  been  about 
the  ability  of  the  German  economy  to  modernize  quickly 
enough  to  keep  up  in  an  increasingly  competitive  global  envi- 
ronment. There  is  also  a  fundamental  debate  about  the  direc- 
tion that  the  economy  must  take  if  it  is  to  remain  successful  and 
prosperous.  That  debate  includes  a  seminal  discussion  about 
Germany's  place  in  the  global  division  of  labor,  an  issue  of 
immense  importance  to  an  exporting  nation  such  as  Germany. 

Those  who  have  led  the  debate,  and  those  who  have  insisted 
most  firmly  that  Germany's  economy  must  change,  are  those 
who  have  seen  the  world  economy  changing  in  directions  that 
would  increasingly  relegate  Germany  to  a  second  rank.  They 
have  seen  the  coming  of  a  world  in  which  the  work  performed 
by  traditional  German  production  sectors — whether  coal,  steel, 
chemicals,  agriculture,  electronics,  or  machinery — can  be 
done  better  and  more  cheaply  elsewhere.  They  believe  firmly 
that  Germany  has  to  deemphasize  some  of  those  sectors  and 
abandon  others  in  order  to  move  with  the  greatest  speed  and 
the  most  powerful  possible  commitment  into  new  areas  that 
will  lead  the  growth  of  the  world  economy. 

Five  German  institutes  charged  with  analyzing  economic 
issues  have  played  a  central  role  in  the  debate,  issuing  a  series 
of  reports  and  recommendations  throughout  the  1980s  and 
1990s  in  which  they  warned  that  the  German  economy  had  to 
change — and  change  quickly.  They  complained  ever  more 
insistently  about  what  they  described  as  the  inadequate 
response  of  federal,  Land,  and  local  governments  to  the  needs 
of  the  evolving  global  economy. 

Those  who  opposed  the  arguments  of  the  institutes  fell  into 
several  categories.  Some  remained  committed  to  traditional 
economic  sectors,  which  they  believed  could  still  perform  com- 
petitively, especially  if  enough  effort  was  made  to  modernize 
and  rationalize  them  or  to  find  particular  specialties.  Others 
supported  traditional  sectors,  not  for  economic  but  for  social 
and  political  reasons.  Still  others  believed  that  the  issues  had  to 
be  raised  and  understood  but  that  action  could  and  perhaps 
should  be  postponed. 

The  basic  complaint  about  modernization  has  been  that  the 
German  economy  has  not  remained  at  the  forefront  of  global 
development  and  progress  and  is  not  moving  decisively  into 
the  ranks  of  the  most  advanced  industrial  societies,  such  as  the 
United  States,  Japan,  and  the  smaller  Asian  economies.  The 
institutes  have  pointed  out  that  new  technologies — such  as 


265 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

computer  hardware  and  software — could  not  only  improve  tra- 
ditional production  but  also  could  become  new  industries  in 
themselves. 

As  part  of  their  assertion  that  Germany  was  not  modernizing 
quickly  enough,  the  institutes  have  also  expressed  concern  that 
the  country  has  not  given  adequate  priority  to  research  and 
development  and  that  German  capital  has  not  been  venture- 
some enough.  They  have  argued  that  funds  have  not  gone  suf- 
ficiently into  the  kinds  of  research  or  into  the  start-up  ventures 
that  have  helped  keep  the  United  States  at  the  forefront  of 
international  inventiveness  even  as  that  country's  traditional 
industries  have  declined. 

This  does  not  mean  that  German  industry  does  not  invest  in 
research  and  development.  EU  statistics  have  consistently 
shown  that  Germany  has  been  either  first  or  second  in  Euro- 
pean research  and  development  expenditures,  with  only 
France  coming  close  enough  to  be  a  real  competitor.  But  those 
same  and  related  statistics  also  have  shown  that  the  German 
lead  has  been  shrinking  and  that  Germany  does  not  have  the 
lead  in  computer-oriented  research  and  development.  In  par- 
ticular, they  have  shown  that  Germany  has  not  been  doing  well 
at  the  global  level,  lagging  behind  the  United  States  and  even 
further  behind  Japan  in  the  pace  at  which  it  has  been  increas- 
ing its  research  expenditures.  In  advanced-technology  areas, 
Germany  has  been  trailing  badly.  The  total  German  private  and 
public  research  effort  has  consistently  amounted  to  about  2.8 
percent  of  GDP,  but  that  is  about  the  same  percentage  as  the 
United  States  and  Japan  and  is  clearly  not  enough  to  allow  the 
smaller  German  economy  to  keep  up.  A  German  patent  office 
study  showed  that  by  1989  West  Germany  had  fallen  behind  in 
three  of  four  major  areas  of  domestic  patent  grants  compared 
with  Japan  and  the  United  States. 

German  technological  progress  has  been  uneven.  The 
country  has  certainly  remained  competitive  in  biotechnology 
and  general  medical  research.  The  same  could  be  said  about  its 
competitive  position  in  smaller  robotic  machine  tools  and  in 
many  areas  of  electronic  and  even  specialized  computer 
research.  But  this  does  not  compensate  fully  for  the  lag  in  cel- 
lular communications,  microtechnology,  and  computers. 

The  German  government  has  been  slow  to  assist  firms  in 
technological  development.  There  has  been  strong  German 
financial  and  scientific  participation  in  a  variety  of  European 
programs,  such  as  Esprit,  Eureka,  Jessi,  Race,  or  Brite — pro- 


266 


The  Domestic  Economy 


grams  that  are  designed  to  internationalize  research  at  the 
European  level  to  enable  the  smaller  European  states  to  com- 
pete against  the  United  States  and  Japan.  These  European 
efforts  are  significant,  but  their  results  as  of  the  mid-1990s  have 
not  allayed  the  concerns  of  many  Germans  about  falling 
behind. 

The  institutes  have  also  addressed  another  problem,  the 
German  lag  in  establishing  new  ventures.  This  shortcoming 
goes  to  the  core  of  the  total  functioning  of  the  German  system, 
including  the  conservatism  of  banking  and  financial  practices. 
Germany  has  not  found  a  way  to  create  an  environment  in 
which  small  entrepreneurs  in  new  fields  arise  in  large  numbers. 

With  unification  as  Germany's  principal  economic  priority, 
the  debate  about  structural  reform  has  taken  second  place, 
and  the  government  is  giving  it  less  priority  than  it  received  in 
the  1980s.  But  it  remains  an  issue  and  will  continue  to  be  so  as 
other  parts  of  the  world  economy — including  Eastern 
Europe — become  more  competitive. 

The  Role  of  Government  and  Other  Institutions 

The  Federal  Government  Role 

The  German  federal  government  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the 
German  economy,  sometimes  directly  and  sometimes  indirectly 
through  the  effects  of  other  policies  on  the  economy.  Unlike 
the  Japanese  government,  there  is  no  single  ministry  that 
attempts  to  direct  industrial  government  and  competitiveness, 
but  government  policy  can  have  wide-ranging  effects  because 
of  the  many  offices  that  play  a  role. 

The  three  principal  figures  responsible  for  economic  policy 
are  the  chancellor,  the  minister  for  economics,  and  the  minis- 
ter of  finance.  The  three  positions  have  rarely  been  held  simul- 
taneously by  members  of  a  single  party  and  are  usually  divided 
among  two  or  sometimes  three  parties.  Economic  policy  there- 
fore has  to  reflect  the  interests  of  at  least  two  political  parties, 
with  all  that  this  means  in  terms  of  compromise  and  concilia- 
tion. The  coalition  negotiations  to  form  a  new  government 
after  a  national  election  are  never  more  delicate  or  more  diffi- 
cult than  when  they  touch  on  economic  policies. 

The  main  parties  have  different  economic  philosophies  and 
pursue  generally  different  objectives.  The  CDU  and  the  CSU 
are  conservative,  business-oriented  parties,  but  with  a  long  tra- 
dition of  support  for  social  welfare  programs.  The  FDP  is  lib- 


267 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

eral  in  the  British  sense,  very  much  in  favor  of  the  free  market 
and  a  minimum  of  government  regulation.  The  SPD  believes 
in  combining  political  freedom  with  large  social  programs  and 
government  involvement  in  the  economy.  It  is  impossible  for 
any  of  the  three  parties  to  be  in  a  government  with  the  others 
without  yielding  something,  and  government  policy  has  there- 
fore usually  contained  a  mixture  of  sometimes  contradictory 
objectives  that  then  must  be  resolved  by  compromises  within 
the  cabinet. 

The  Chancellor 

The  way  the  chancellor  and  his  office,  the  Chancellory,  deal 
with  the  economy  depends  very  much  on  the  incumbent's 
interests  and  personal  style.  For  example,  under  Helmut 
Schmidt  (1974-82),  who  was  very  interested  in  economic  mat- 
ters, the  Chancellory  shaped,  directed,  and  coordinated  the 
economic  policy  of  the  entire  government  economic  appara- 
tus. It  also  kept  close  contact  with  the  business  and  financial 
community,  including  the  Bundesbank,  and  became  deeply 
involved  in  long-range  planning.  Helmut  Kohl  (1982-  ),  how- 
ever, has  operated  very  differently,  using  the  Chancellory  for 
limited  day-to-day  coordination  but  not  attempting  to  use  it  to 
manage  the  economic  policy  of  the  government.  He  has  used 
the  political,  not  the  bureaucratic,  structure  to  make  policy, 
working  through  the  CDU/CSU  and  the  FDP  or  through  per- 
sonal contacts.  Although  Kohl  was  definitely  in  charge  of  die 
Wende  and  other  government  policies,  he  has  not  usually  pre- 
sented himself  as  either  the  originator  or  the  executor  of  eco- 
nomic and  financial  policy.  He  has  chosen  to  control  events 
from  behind  the  scenes,  reducing  the  government's  visibility  as 
well  as  its  role. 

The  Minister  of  Finance  and  the  Minister  for  Economy 

In  the  cabinet,  roles  are  more  fixed,  although  they  might 
change  in  accordance  with  personalities  and  political  parties. 
The  primus  inter  pares  over  the  last  several  decades  has  been  the 
minister  of  finance.  He  is  responsible  for  the  federal  budget, 
which  has  become  ever  more  important  as  the  government's 
share  of  national  income  has  grown  and  as  governments 
increasingly  use  the  budget  to  set  priorities  and  guide  national 
economic  activity.  The  minister  of  finance  also  accompanies 
the  chancellor  to  the  annual  financial  summits  and  is  the  main 
German  spokesperson  in  the  meetings  of  the  Group  of  Seven 


268 


The  Domestic  Economy 


(G-7 — see  Glossary),  the  world's  principal  economic  powers. 
He  is  thus  in  a  position  to  manage  not  only  domestic  but  also 
international  financial  policy  for  Germany  and  to  coordinate 
the  two. 

The  minister  for  economics,  once  the  government's  chief 
economic  policy  maker  (especially  when  the  minister  was  Lud- 
wig  Erhard),  has  gradually  lost  power  as  many  of  the  important 
functions  have  been  transferred  to  other  ministries — including 
new  ministries  concerned  with  environment  and  research. 
Since  the  1970s,  the  minister  for  economics  has  functioned 
more  like  a  United  States  secretary  of  commerce,  remaining  a 
principal  channel  for  contact  with  industry,  labor,  and  semi- 
public  associations.  But  several  of  the  ministers  have  com- 
plained in  bitter  frustration  that  they  were  not  able  to  carry  out 
the  policies  they  wanted. 

The  Bundeskartellamt 

The  Bundeskartellamt  (Federal  Cartel  Office)  is  the  institu- 
tion specifically  instructed  and  empowered  to  prevent  a  return 
to  the  monopolies  and  cartels  that  periodically  controlled 
much  of  the  German  economy  between  the  1870s  and  1940s. 
The  policies  of  the  office,  like  the  office  itself,  have  been  con- 
troversial, with  some  Germans  wanting  it  to  have  greater  power 
and  others  believing  that  it  is  already  abusing  its  existing 
authority. 

The  Bundeskartellamt  was  established  in  1957.  Many,  includ- 
ing Erhard,  believed  that  it  had  not  been  given  enough  author- 
ity to  restrict  cartels  and  other  monopolistic  practices.  The 
Western  Allies  had  insisted  that  the  fledgling  Federal  Republic 
have  such  a  law,  but  West  German  business  associations  used 
their  influence  to  undercut  the  authority  of  the  Bundeskartel- 
lamt to  the  point  where  it  has  sometimes  been  described  as  a 
"Swiss  cheese  with  countless  holes."  Some  of  the  holes  in  the 
Swiss  cheese  were  closed  in  1973,  when  the  Bundestag  passed  a 
merger  law  (Fusions gesetz)  intended  to  block  monopolies  in 
advance  so  that  the  Bundeskartellamt  would  not  always  have  to 
act  after  the  fact. 

In  retrospect,  the  laws  and  the  office  have  performed  a  cen- 
tral and  useful  function,  but  they  have  not  been  able  to  prevent 
a  gradual  shift  toward  ever  larger  companies  in  Germany.  The 
number  of  mergers  in  West  Germany  increased  rapidly  during 
the  late  1980s,  rising  to  over  1,000  per  year.  And  the  Bundes- 
kartellamt has  not  been  effective  in  curtailing  the  countless 


269 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

informal  contacts  and  discussions  that  have  characterized  the 
German  system  (like  other  European  systems)  and  that  would 
be  suspect  and  perhaps  illegal  in  the  United  States. 

Because  the  Bundeskartellamt  tends  to  use  nonconfronta- 
tional  tactics,  the  office  has  often  been  denounced  as  ineffec- 
tive. Critics  contend  that  the  office  has  actually  blocked  very 
few  mergers  or  other  forms  of  cooperation.  They  also  assert 
that  hidden  monopolistic  or  oligopolistic  practices  have  been 
creeping  back  into  the  German  economy.  But  others  argue 
that  the  very  existence  of  the  Bundeskartellamt  has  enhanced 
competition  and  that  the  office's  predilection  for  solving  prob- 
lems through  nonjudicial  processes  fits  properly  into  the  Ger- 
man system  and  is  therefore  effective  in  that  system. 

Despite  its  title,  the  Bundeskartellamt  does  not  have  the 
final  authority  over  German  mergers  and  acquisitions.  That 
authority  is  reserved  for  the  political  level,  the  Ministry  for  Eco- 
nomics, which  on  more  than  one  occasion  has  overruled  the 
Bundeskartellamt.  After  the  Bundeskartellamt  had  raised  a 
number  of  searching  questions  about  the  legality  and  propriety 
of  Daimler-Benz's  1989  acquisition  of  Messerschmidt-Bolkow- 
Blohm  (MBB),  and  after  it  had  even  disapproved  the  acquisi- 
tion, the  minister  for  economics  approved  the  merger  on  con- 
dition that  Daimler-Benz  and  MBB  sell  off  majority  control  in  a 
small  marine  and  technology  division.  The  government  justi- 
fied the  step  by  recalling  that  it  had  specifically  sought  the 
merger  to  support  MBB — which  was  engaged  in  military  pro- 
duction and  could  not  be  permitted  to  collapse — with  Daimler- 
Benz's  financial  resources. 

The  Bundeskartellamt  has  faced  a  particularly  difficult  task 
in  the  integration  of  the  East  German  and  West  German  econ- 
omies. Many  eastern  German  firms  could  not  survive  unless 
they  could  merge  with  large  western  German  firms.  The  pro- 
cess may,  however,  create  new  enterprises  whose  size  and  com- 
bination of  resources  could  open  the  way  for  monopolistic  or 
oligopolistic  temptations.  Powerful  economic  and  political 
pressures  for  such  mergers  exist,  especially  to  help  revitalize 
eastern  Germany,  but  they  also  raise  serious  questions  about 
their  potentially  negative  impact  on  competition.  Under  those 
circumstances,  the  Bundeskartellamt  has  acted  with  consider- 
able circumspection,  blocking  some  mergers  but  approving 
most  of  them. 

The  Bundeskartellamt  faces  an  even  greater  problem  in  the 
growing  Europeanization  of  German  business  under  the  aegis 


270 


The  Domestic  Economy 


of  deeper  EU  integration.  It  became  clear  by  the  early  1990s 
that  the  EU's  European  Commission  in  Brussels  was  prepared 
to  permit  greater  cooperation  between  European  firms  in 
order  to  compete  more  effectively  against  the  worldwide  reach 
of  the  giant  corporations  of  the  United  States  and  Japan.  Such 
cooperation  went  against  German  cartel  laws.  To  solve  the 
problem,  the  Bundeskartellamt  announced  in  early  1993  that  it 
would  permit  greater  degrees  of  cooperation  between  small- 
and  medium-sized  German  firms  if  that  cooperation  actually 
led  to  greater  intra-European  competition. 

Land  and  Local  Governments 

Because  Germany  has  a  federal  system,  state  {Land;  pi., 
Lander)  and  local  governments  also  have  important  functions. 
This  reflects  the  German  tradition,  which  before  Hitler  com- 
bined a  mix  of  national,  Land,  and  local  structures  with  care- 
fully defined  and  deliberately  circumscribed  powers.  Land  and 
even  local  authorities  are  involved  in  many  economic  func- 
tions, such  as  social  services,  development  and  energy  policy, 
education  (including  vocational  training),  public  housing, 
environmental  protection,  and  industrial  policy.  They  also 
share  certain  tax  revenues  that  are  centrally  collected  but  dis- 
tributed among  the  central,  Land,  and  local  authorities  in 
accordance  with  carefully  negotiated  ratios  that  were  changed 
after  unification  slightly  to  the  advantage  of  the  new  eastern 
Lander. 

The  Lander  do  not  always  act  and  think  alike.  Different  old 
Lander  have  followed  different  economic  policies  since  the 
early  years  of  the  Federal  Republic.  On  the  one  hand,  the  min- 
ister presidents,  or  heads,  of  two  Lander,  Bavaria  and  Baden- 
Wurttemberg,  have  stressed  industrial  development  policies 
that  have  departed  radically  from  those  of  others,  putting  their 
Lander  into  the  forefront  of  German  technological  develop- 
ment. On  the  other  hand,  the  Lander  of  North  Rhine-Westpha- 
lia and  the  Saarland  for  a  long  time  concentrated  their 
resources  on  subsidizing  coal  and  steel  production,  entering 
the  competition  for  new  industries  much  later  than  other 
Lander.  The  possibility  for  creating  separate  Land  policies  has 
also  encouraged  some  new  Lander  to  try  their  own  develop- 
ment policies.  They  have  invited  potential  investors  from  other 
countries  to  visit  them,  and  they  have  engaged  in  export  pro- 
motion.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Government  Subsidies 

The  Lander  are  not  alone  in  subsidizing  or  supporting  cer- 
tain industries:  the  federal  government  does  it  to  a  massive  and 
increasingly  significant  degree.  Despite  Germany's  commit- 
ment to  a  social  market  economy,  exceptions  to  market  princi- 
ples existed  in  West  Germany  and  are  proliferating  in  united 
Germany.  German  economic  institutes  and  experts  have 
repeatedly  warned  that  authorities  at  various  levels  have  sup- 
ported many  economic  activities  that  should  long  ago  have 
been  discontinued  or  compelled  to  become  competitive.  Fed- 
eral and  Land  authorities  have  ignored  the  complaints  of  the 
economists  but  have  usually  promised  to  reduce  or  eliminate 
subsidies  as  soon  as  feasible. 

Before  unification,  the  West  German  government  and  vari- 
ous Lander  supported  a  number  of  industries  and  services,  such 
as  coal,  steel,  aerospace,  shipbuilding,  and  agriculture,  with  the 
federal  government  supporting  activities  across  the  board  and 
the  Lander  supporting  locally  important  and  influential  indus- 
tries. Between  1970  and  1989,  the  total  volume  of  subsidies, 
including  those  paid  through  the  European  Community  (EC — 
see  Glossary),  rose  from  DM12  billion  to  over  DM45  billion. 
The  level  of  subsidies  rose  almost  uninterruptedly,  even  after 
Kohl  assumed  office  and  his  government  had  committed  itself 
to  reducing  them.  Although  some  categories  of  subsidies — for 
example,  those  for  agriculture — were  not  fully  under  West  Ger- 
man but  rather  under  EC  control,  even  the  portion  specifically 
designated  for  German  farmers  also  rose  by  250  percent  dur- 
ing the  1980s.  Overall,  the  federal  government  provided  about 
one-third  of  total  West  German  subsidies.  The  other  two-thirds 
came  from  the  Lander and  the  localities.  During  the  late  1980s 
and  early  1990s,  the  total  has  generally  averaged  around  6  per- 
cent of  West  German  GDP,  although  it  has  risen  because  of  uni- 
fication. 

Despite  the  concern  expressed  about  West  German  subsi- 
dies, a  1990  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and 
Development  (OECD — see  Glossary)  survey  of  Germany  con- 
cluded that  German  subsidies  were  not  unusually  high  by  the 
standards  of  the  EC.  The  OECD  described  them  as  being 
around  the  average  for  OECD  countries.  Separate  Interna- 
tional Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary)  and  Ministry  of 
Finance  studies  reached  a  similar  conclusion,  indicating  that 
West  Germany  was  actually  somewhat  below  the  average  among 
EC  members  in  the  level  of  subsidies. 


272 


The  Domestic  Economy 


Although  such  conclusions  might  have  offered  some  com- 
fort as  a  matter  of  general  policy,  it  remains  true  that  some  Ger- 
man industries — especially  in  the  traditional  coal  and  steel 
complex — are  dependent  on  subsidies  to  such  an  extent  that 
they  would  have  to  be  closed  if  they  no  longer  benefited  from 
government  support  of  one  kind  or  another.  But  subsidies  are 
also  often  paid  even  to  some  of  the  largest  and  most  profitable 
German  concerns,  such  as  Daimler-Benz,  Siemens,  Bayer,  and 
Volkswagen,  for  special  production  or  research  lines.  Those 
companies  have  usually  stated  that  the  subsidies  cover  only  a 
minute  part  of  their  expenditures. 

After  unification,  the  combined  subsidies  of  western  and 
eastern  budgets  rose  even  higher,  and  the  new  all-German  gov- 
ernment has  found  itself  compelled  to  provide  even  more  sub- 
sidies in  order  not  to  permit  an  excessive  level  of  structural 
unemployment  in  the  former  East  Germany.  Official  East  Ger- 
man statistics  suggested  that  the  level  of  subsidies  in  the  GDR 
budget  was  30  percent,  but  in  reality  the  level  may  have  been 
much  higher  because  of  the  generally  low  level  of  productivity 
in  the  GDR.  Although  no  total  figures  for  German  subsidies 
have  been  available  in  the  confusion  and  diversity  of  programs 
since  unification,  the  government  has  already  promised  to 
keep  a  number  of  unprofitable  East  German  ventures  (such  as 
the  steel  complex  around  Eisenhuttenstadt  and  the  shipbuild- 
ing docks  around  Rostock)  in  production  until  they  become 
competitive — which  will  not  be  for  decades,  if  at  all. 

Government  Expenditures  and  the  National  Debt 

Beyond  subsidies,  German  politicians,  businessmen,  and 
economists  have  consistently  had  difficulty  calculating  the  most 
suitable  role  for  the  state  in  the  German  economy.  Many  econ- 
omists believed  that  the  role  of  the  state  had  become  too  large 
in  West  Germany  during  the  1970s  because  of  government 
ownership  of  large  companies,  because  of  subsidies,  and 
because  of  the  high  social  welfare  programs  established  by  the 
SPD-led  governments.  The  right  level  after  unification  is  even 
more  difficult  to  define  and  to  agree  upon,  because  eastern 
Germany  will  need  much  more  infrastructure  construction  and 
many  more  social  programs  than  western  Germany  for  many 
years  to  come. 

As  a  share  of  national  income,  German  government  expen- 
ditures at  all  levels  were  15  percent  before  World  War  I,  25  per- 
cent during  the  interwar  period,  35  percent  around  1960,  48 


273 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

percent  in  1975,  and  about  50  percent  by  1980-81.  The  govern- 
ment's share  of  spending,  although  worrisome  to  the  West  Ger- 
mans, still  remained  lower  than  that  of  several  other  European 
states,  such  as  Sweden,  the  Netherlands,  France,  and  Belgium. 
West  Germany  and  Britain  were  the  only  major  European  states 
to  reduce  government  spending  as  a  share  of  GDP  during  the 
1980s.  But  their  government  share  still  remained  higher  than 
that  of  two  principal  competitors,  the  United  States,  at  about 
37  percent,  and  Japan,  at  about  33  percent.  The  German  share 
has  risen  well  over  50  percent  again  during  the  early  1990s 
because  of  the  costs  of  unification,  and  there  is  little  if  any  pros- 
pect that  it  will  decline  again  until  the  end  of  the  decade. 

Despite  the  declining  deficits  of  the  1980s,  the  cumulative 
public-sector  debt  of  various  levels  of  German  government  has 
grown  during  virtually  the  entire  existence  of  the  Federal 
Republic.  During  the  1960s,  the  total  debt  doubled.  During  the 
1970s,  it  doubled  every  five  years.  The  growth  rate  in  debt 
began  to  slow  after  the  first  years  of  the  1980s,  but  it  began  to 
rise  rapidly  during  the  1990s  as  a  result  of  unification.  By  the 
end  of  1989,  the  West  German  government  said  that  the  total 
public-sector  debt  in  Germany  was  DM1,020  billion,  or  45  per- 
cent of  what  was  then  West  German  GDP.  By  the  early  1990s, 
however,  that  figure  had  risen  by  several  100  billion  deutsche 
marks  and  was  estimated  to  be  almost  DM1.5  trillion,  or  50  per- 
cent of  united  German  GDP.  It  rose  to  over  DM1.6  trillion  by 
the  end  of  1993  and  is  expected  to  rise  to  over  60  percent  of 
GDP  by  the  mid-1990s  and  then  to  begin  to  decline  slowly  after 
that.  Interest  payments  on  the  public  debt  have  become  the 
second  largest  single  line  item  in  the  German  budget,  absorb- 
ing 14  percent  of  the  budget. 

The  Associations 

All  participants  in  the  German  national  economy  organize 
themselves  into  various  associations.  They  do  so  either  volun- 
tarily or,  in  some  associations,  as  a  legal  requirement.  The  asso- 
ciations are  commonly  known  in  German  as  the  Verbande.  Over 
1,200  are  represented  in  Bonn.  Each  plays  a  chosen  or  assigned 
role,  and  together  they  help  contribute  to  a  broad  framework 
of  cooperation  mingled  with  competition. 

All  the  Verbande  operate  as  lobbies  in  Germany  itself,  working 
with  the  parliament,  the  Bundestag,  and  the  bureaucracy,  and 
they  also  lobby  appropriate  EU  offices  in  Brussels.  But  they  are 
far  more  than  lobbies.  They  act  as  sector  and  regional  coordi- 


274 


The  Domestic  Economy 


nators.  Some  not  only  exercise  a  voice  toward  the  government 
but  also  represent  a  forum  where  industrialists  or  others  can 
meet  and  talk  about  business  affairs.  Some  serve  as  planning 
institutions,  collecting  and  disseminating  information  on  antic- 
ipated sales,  production  capacities,  and  investment  goals.  Oth- 
ers negotiate  and  settle  conflicts  between  different  firms  or 
industries.  They  help  to  administer  the  German  economic 
mechanism  as  a  whole. 

Among  the  main  associations  are  the  Federation  of  German 
Industry  (Bundesverband  der  Deutschen  Industrie — BDI)  and 
the  German  Chambers  of  Industry  and  Commerce  (Deutscher 
Industrie-  und  Handelstag — DIHT).  The  BDI  is  the  central 
organization  representing  the  interests  and  policies  of  German 
industry.  Because  of  its  role  in  organizing  and  representing 
German  industry,  the  BDI  has  immense  influence.  Any  Ger- 
man government,  even  one  with  an  SPD  majority,  will  consult 
with  it  before  making  any  policy  or  introducing  any  legislation 
that  could  affect  German  industry  or  the  German  economy  as 
a  whole.  So  will  key  members  of  the  Bundestag.  The  BDI  has 
no  individual  members,  but  only  other  associations  of  one  or 
another  industry,  so  that  it  is  in  effect  an  association  of  associa- 
tions. 

The  DIHT  is  the  umbrella  organization  of  the  German 
Chambers  of  Commerce.  It  represents  all  business  interests, 
but  especially  small  business,  on  a  regional  as  well  as  a  sectoral 
basis.  Membership  is  obligatory  for  German  firms,  and  mem- 
bership is  on  an  individual  or  a  company  basis  rather  than  on 
an  association  basis  as  in  the  BDI. 

Some  of  the  powers  of  the  chambers  of  commerce  in  Ger- 
many would  be  exercised  by  government  authorities  in  almost 
any  other  country.  The  chambers  participate  in  vocational 
training  programs,  issue  licenses  and  work  permits,  set  store 
hours,  solve  disputes  between  members,  issue  certificates  of  ori- 
gin, run  stock  exchanges,  and  so  on.  They  are  legally  entitled 
to  make  their  views  known  in  a  variety  of  governmental  forums 
from  the  local  to  the  national  level,  and  they  thus  have  direct  as 
well  as  indirect  influence  over  many  elements  of  the  economy. 
Their  functions  are  central  to  the  operation  of  the  German  sys- 
tem, as  they  have  been  throughout  much  of  German  history. 

The  chambers  constitute  an  important  link  not  only  in  the 
formal  but  also  in  the  informal  coordinating  mechanisms  that 
operate  throughout  the  economy.  Whereas  the  BDI  might  be 
more  visible  in  national  policy  matters  and  might  influence 


275 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

national  government  decisions  more  directly,  the  chambers 
and  the  DIHT  have  a  more  pervasive  presence  at  the  local  and 
regional  level  than  at  the  national  level.  They  shape  and  often 
author  most  of  the  regulations  that  determine  how  commerce 
and  industry  can  act,  helping  to  establish  the  day-to-day  rules 
under  which  production  and  trade  take  place. 

Another  important  interest  organization  is  the  Federation  of 
German  Employers'  Associations  (Bundesvereinigung  der 
Deutschen  Arbeitgeberverbande — BDA).  It  coordinates  the 
collective  bargaining  strategy  of  German  employers,  adminis- 
ters the  strike  fund,  gives  legal  advice,  and  deals  with  matters 
relating  to  social  policy.  Eight  member  federations  organize 
enterprises  in  industry,  handicrafts,  commerce,  banking,  agri- 
culture, transportation,  insurance,  and  publishing. 

A  broad  division  of  labor  exists  among  the  separate  German 
employers'  associations.  The  BDI,  for  which  the  closest  United 
States  parallel  is  the  National  Association  of  Manufacturers, 
mainly  addresses  matters  of  broad  economic  policy.  It  is,  how- 
ever, much  more  influential  than  any  parallel  United  States 
organization.  It  helps  shape  Germany's  policies  in  the  EU  and 
is  a  voice  for  an  open  trading  system.  The  DIHT  might  be  com- 
pared to  the  United  States  Chamber  of  Commerce.  It  repre- 
sents regional  interests  as  well  as  the  interests  of  small-  and 
medium-sized  enterprises.  It  exercises  a  great  deal  more  influ- 
ence and  even  authority  locally.  The  BDA  concentrates  on 
labor  and  social  legislation  and  also  acts  as  the  representative 
of  employers  with  the  trade  unions. 

German  farmers  are  organized  into  the  German  Farmers' 
Association  (Deutscher  Bauernverband — DBV) .  This  organiza- 
tion has  over  1  million  members.  It  has  exercised  a  powerful 
influence  on  German  and  European  agricultural  policies,  help- 
ing to  keep  production  and  consumption  prices  above  world 
levels.  The  proportional  influence  of  the  DBV  has  grown  since 
German  unification  because  agriculture  represented  a  more 
important  share  of  eastern  German  than  western  German  pro- 
duction (see  Agriculture,  this  ch.). 

The  Culture  of  German  Management 

German  management,  as  it  has  evolved  over  the  centuries 
and  has  established  itself  since  World  War  II,  has  a  distinct  style 
and  culture.  Like  so  many  things  German,  it  goes  back  to  the 
medieval  guild  and  merchant  tradition,  but  it  also  has  a  sense 
of  the  future  and  of  the  long  term. 


276 


The  Domestic  Economy 


The  German  style  of  competition  is  rigorous  but  not  ruin- 
ous. Although  companies  might  compete  for  the  same  general 
market,  as  Daimler-Benz  and  BMW  do,  they  generally  seek  mar- 
ket share  rather  than  market  domination.  Many  compete  for  a 
specific  niche.  German  companies  despise  price  competition. 
Instead,  they  engage  in  what  German  managers  describe  as 
Leistungswettbewerb,  competition  on  the  basis  of  excellence  in 
their  products  and  services.  They  compete  on  a  price  basis  only 
when  it  is  necessary,  as  in  the  sale  of  bulk  materials  like  chemi- 
cals or  steel. 

The  German  manager  concentrates  intensely  on  two  objec- 
tives: product  quality  and  product  service.  He  wants  his  com- 
pany to  be  the  best,  and  he  wants  it  to  have  the  best  products. 
The  manager  and  his  entire  team  are  strongly  product  ori- 
ented, confident  that  a  good  product  will  sell  itself.  But  the 
manager  also  places  a  high  premium  on  customer  satisfaction, 
and  Germans  are  ready  to  style  a  product  to  suit  a  customer's 
wishes.  The  watchwords  for  most  German  managers  and  com- 
panies are  quality,  responsiveness,  dedication,  and  follow-up. 

Product  orientation  usually  also  means  production  orienta- 
tion. Most  German  managers,  even  at  senior  levels,  know  their 
production  lines.  They  follow  production  methods  closely  and 
know  their  shop  floors  intimately.  They  cannot  understand 
managers  in  the  United  States  who  want  only  to  see  financial 
statements  and  "the  bottom  line"  rather  than  inspect  a  plant's 
production  processes.  A  German  manager  believes  deeply  that 
a  good-quality  production  line  and  a  good-quality  product  will 
do  more  for  the  bottom  line  than  anything  else.  Relations 
between  German  managers  and  workers  are  often  close, 
because  they  believe  that  they  are  working  together  to  create  a 
good  product. 

If  there  is  a  third  objective  beyond  quality  and  service,  it  is 
cooperation — or  at  least  coordination — with  government.  Ger- 
man industry  works  closely  with  government.  German  manage- 
ment is  sensitive  to  government  standards,  government 
policies,  and  government  regulations.  Virtually  all  German 
products  are  subject  to  norms — the  German  Industrial  Norms 
(Deutsche  Industrie  Normen — DIN) — established  through 
consultation  between  industry  and  government  but  with  strong 
inputs  from  the  management  associations,  chambers  of  com- 
merce, and  trade  unions.  As  a  result  of  these  practices,  the  con- 
cept of  private  initiative  operating  within  a  public  framework 


277 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

lies  firmly  imbedded  in  the  consciousness  of  German  manag- 
ers. 

The  German  management  style  is  not  litigious.  Neither  the 
government,  the  trade  unions,  nor  the  business  community 
encourages  litigation  if  there  is  no  clear  sign  of  genuine  and 
deliberate  injury.  Firms  do  not  maintain  large  legal  staffs.  Dis- 
agreements are  often  talked  out,  sometimes  over  a  conference 
table,  sometimes  over  a  beer,  and  sometimes  in  a  gathering 
called  by  a  chamber  of  commerce  or  an  industrial  association. 
Differences  are  usually  settled  quietly,  often  privately.  Frequent 
litigation  is  regarded  as  reflecting  more  on  the  accuser  than  on 
the  accused.  Because  of  these  attitudes,  Germany  has  compara- 
tively few  lawyers.  With  one-third  the  population  and  one-third 
the  GDP  of  the  United  States,  Germany  has  about  one-twenti- 
eth the  number  of  lawyers. 

German  managers  are  drawn  largely  from  the  ranks  of  engi- 
neers and  technicians,  from  those  who  manufacture,  design,  or 
service,  although  more  nonengineers  have  risen  to  the  top  in 
recent  years.  They  are  better  paid  than  other  Europeans 
(except  the  Swiss),  but  on  average  receive  about  two-thirds  of 
the  income  that  their  American  counterparts  expect. 

Because  managers  usually  remain  in  one  firm  throughout 
their  careers,  rising  slowly  through  the  ranks,  they  do  not  need 
a  visible  bottom-line  result  quickly.  Managers  do  not  need  to  be 
concerned  about  how  their  careers  might  be  affected  by  a  com- 
pany's or  a  division's  progress,  or  lack  of  progress,  for  each  year 
and  certainly  not  for  each  quarter. 

German  taxation  also  induces  management  toward  long- 
term  planning.  German  tax  legislation  and  accounting  prac- 
tices permit  German  firms  to  allocate  considerable  sums  to 
reserves.  German  capital  gains  tax  rules  exempt  capital  gains 
income  if  the  assets  are  held  for  more  than  six  months  or,  in 
the  case  of  real  estate,  for  more  than  two  years. 

Because  management  has  not  been  regarded  in  Germany  as 
a  separate  science,  it  was  rare  until  the  1980s  to  find  courses  in 
management  techniques  such  as  those  taught  at  schools  of 
management  in  the  United  States.  Germans  believed  that  man- 
agement as  a  separate  discipline  bred  selfishness,  disloyalty, 
bureaucratic  maneuvering,  short-term  thinking,  and  a  danger- 
ous tendency  to  neglect  quality  production.  Instead,  courses  at 
German  universities  concentrated  more  on  business  adminis- 
tration, or  Betriebswirtschaft,  producing  a  Betriebswirt  degree. 
Despite  this,  two  West  German  schools  for  business  administra-

don,  the  Hochschule  fur  Unternehmensfuhrung  and  the  Euro- 
pean Business  School,  were  established  during  the  1980s,  but 
they  teach  in  ways  that  reinforce  rather  than  overturn  tradi- 
tional German  ways  of  management. 

Out  of  this  compendium  of  business  practices  arises  what 
might  be  termed  a  German  management  style,  with  the  follow- 
ing characteristics:  collegial,  consensual,  product-  and  quality- 
oriented,  export-conscious,  and  loyal  to  one  company  and 
committed  to  its  long-term  prospects.  One  could  legitimately 
conclude  from  this  that  the  German  system  could  stifle  change 
because  it  is  not  as  innovative,  aggressive,  or  results-oriented  as 
the  United  States  management  style.  That,  however,  would  not 
be  correct,  for  change  can  and  does  take  place.  It  occurs  gradu- 
ally, not  always  obviously,  under  the  mottoes  of  stability  and 
permanence,  with  the  least  dislocation  possible,  and  often 
under  competitive  pressures  from  abroad.  German  managers 
themselves  occasionally  speculate  that  change  might  come  too 
slowly,  but  they  are  not  certain  whether  or  how  to  alter  the  sys- 
tem and  its  incentive  structures. 

Labor  and  Codetermination 
Labor 

German  labor  has  as  much  of  a  culture  as  German  manage- 
ment. The  abilities  and  the  attitudes  of  the  labor  force  have 
contributed  at  least  as  much  to  the  success  of  the  German  sys- 
tem as  those  of  management,  and  perhaps  even  more  so.  Many 
workers,  especially  in  small-  or  medium-sized  firms,  regard 
themselves  as  serious  professionals  with  a  stake  in  their  com- 
pany and  are  usually  treated  as  such.  They  live  in  comfortable 
circumstances,  not  as  the  factory  workers  of  old.  They  usually 
travel  abroad,  often  own  foreign  property,  and  otherwise  lead 
lives  that  had  formerly  been  reserved  for  the  middle  class. 

German  workers  have  consistently  had  the  highest  level  of 
education  of  any  group  of  workers  in  Europe,  with  much  of 
that  education  acquired  after  they  finish  formal  secondary 
school  training.  Worker  training  usually  lasts  two  to  three  years 
and  may  last  longer  for  highly  specialized  vocations  (see  The 
Education  System,  ch.  4).  About  2.5  million  Germans,  or 
almost  half  of  the  fifteen-  to  nineteen-year-old  age-group  of 
both  genders,  annually  receive  vocational  training  within  a 
range  of  about  400  designated  occupational  specialties,  often 
on  the  basis  of  contracts  with  preselected  employers. 


280 


The  Domestic  Economy 


Of  the  many  fields  to  choose  from  in  German  vocational 
training,  most  apprentices  select  from  about  twenty  specializa- 
tions. Young  men  prefer  training  in  manufacturing,  crafts,  car- 
pentry, electronics,  or  painting.  Young  women  prefer  training 
in  sales,  industrial  purchasing,  officework  or  banking,  or  medi- 
cal assistance.  Even  while  they  are  in  training,  the  students 
might  receive  up  to  DM1,200  in  salary  per  month,  although 
most  receive  less  than  that,  down  to  DM255. 

After  finishing  vocational  training,  students  can  go  to  techni- 
cal colleges  located  all  over  Germany,  or  to  public  health  or 
nursing  colleges,  and  they  can  move  on  to  advanced  specializa- 
tion courses  in  programs  for  continuing  education.  Those  sys- 
tems exist  separately  from  academic  colleges  and  universities 
but  can  be  as  demanding. 

The  programs  are  expensive  for  industry  as  well  as  for  gov- 
ernment. One  estimate  was  that  West  German  industry  before 
unification  spent  about  DM35  billion  annually  to  support  the 
program.  The  philosophy  governing  the  expenditure  of  time 
and  money  was  articulated  by  the  head  of  personnel  at  Volks- 
wagen, who  said:  "Training  costs  money;  not  to  train  costs  a 
great  deal  more  money." 

The  high  level  of  training  of  German  workers  produces  a 
"quality  time"  labor  productivity  formula.  The  German  worker 
spends  fewer  hours  per  year  at  work  than  any  competitor,  aver- 
aging an  annual  1,708  hours  compared  with  1,763  in  France, 
1,778  in  Britain,  1,912  in  the  United  States,  and  2,166  in  Japan. 
Yet  Germany  has  the  highest  share  of  world  trade  in  goods  with 
a  high  skill  content:  20  percent,  as  against  17  percent  for  Japan, 
15  percent  for  the  United  States,  and  7  percent  for  France. 

Many  of  western  Germany's  labor  traditions  have  moved 
smoothly  to  eastern  Germany  since  unification.  Vocational 
training  already  existed  in  the  GDR,  and  labor  in  East  Germany 
was  not  as  inefficient  as  management  or  as  the  often  anti- 
quated production  machinery.  Therefore,  although  there  have 
been  problems  of  adjustment,  especially  for  older  workers  in 
the  east  who  were  not  accustomed  to  the  pace  of  a  modern  pro- 
duction site,  on  the  whole  the  eastern  labor  force  has  adapted 
well. 

Many  of  the  generalizations  that  can  be  made  about  German 
labor  cannot  be  applied  equally  to  the  foreign  workers  who 
constitute  about  one-tenth  of  the  country's  labor  force.  The  2 
million  foreigners  employed  in  Germany  often  work  in  very 
large  companies,  on  assembly  lines,  in  mining  and  chemical 


281 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

operations  with  little  prospect  for  advancement,  or  in  some  ser- 
vice sectors  at  menial  tasks  under  difficult  conditions.  Approxi- 
mately 25  percent  of  foreigners  work  in  steel  and  iron 
foundries,  another  25  percent  in  hotels  and  restaurants  (often 
as  cleaning  staff),  and  another  15  percent  on  automobile 
assembly  lines.  Certain  industries,  such  as  steel  production,  tex- 
tiles, or  mining,  could  not  function  without  them. 

Among  the  principal  reasons  for  the  decline  in  Germany's 
economic  growth  have  been  the  high  costs  associated  with  pro- 
duction. German  labor  costs  per  hour  in  the  manufacturing 
industry  have  achieved  the  dubious  honor  of  being  the  highest 
in  the  world — largely  because  of  high  social  costs.  As  the 
Bundesbank's  tight  money  policies  have  consistently  made  the 
deutsche  mark  ever  stronger,  German  labor  costs  have  grown 
even  higher  against  those  in  other  countries.  In  part  because  of 
the  rise  in  the  value  of  the  deutsche  mark,  total  German  wage 
costs  were  estimated  by  1992  to  be  about  50  percent  higher 
than  in  the  average  West  European  state,  the  United  States,  or 
Japan,  and  many  times  higher  than  those  prevailing  in  most 
Asian  states,  in  Eastern  Europe,  or  in  the  developing  world. 
The  Bundesbank  estimated  that  those  costs  had  risen  by  almost 
10  percent  between  the  beginning  of  1991  and  the  beginning 
of  1993.  Chancellor  Kohl  himself  complained  that  German 
workers  could  not  afford  to  continue  to  have  "the  shortest 
working  week,  the  lowest  number  of  working  years,  and  above 
all,  which  is  the  worst,  the  shortest  machine  operating  time  .  .  . 
in  all  the  European  Community."  But,  although  a  number  of 
German  wage  settlements  in  1993  and  1994  raised  wages  by  less 
than  the  anticipated  inflation  rate,  there  are  no  signs  that  Ger- 
man labor  is  prepared  to  lower  its  income  to  meet  interna- 
tional competition.  The  average  German  worker  believes  that 
quality  production  and  efficiency  justify  his  or  her  high 
income. 

Codetermi  nation 

Codetermination  (Mitbestimmung),  under  which  German 
workers  or  their  representatives  sit  on  the  governing  boards  or 
the  factory  councils  of  most  German  firms,  is  a  classic  example 
of  how  the  German  system  reconciles  apparent  opposites  and 
points  them  to  a  common  purpose  and  in  a  common  direction. 
Codetermination  did  not  come  about  in  West  Germany  in  a 
single  step.  It  evolved  and  expanded  through  five  different 
West  German  laws,  beginning  in  1951  and  continuing  in  1952, 


282 


The  Domestic  Economy 


1954,  1972,  and  1976.  The  first  three  laws  were  passed  by  CDU- 
led  coalition  governments,  the  last  two  by  SPD-led  govern- 
ments. All  the  codetermination  statutes  were  applied  to  eastern 
Germany  after  unification.  Through  the  combination  of  those 
laws,  85  percent  of  all  German  employees  are  included  in  some 
form  of  codetermination. 

Codetermination  takes  place  through  two  structures,  the 
Aufsichtsrat  (supervisory  board)  in  a  large  enterprise  and/or 
the  Betriebsrat  (factory  council)  in  most  companies.  Over  two- 
thirds  of  all  German  firms  have  a  Betriebsrat.  Only  about  one- 
fourth  have  an  Aufsichtsrat.  Many  large  firms  have  both.  If  a 
firm  is  large  enough  to  have  both,  the  workers  are  twice  repre- 
sented. Depending  on  the  size  of  the  firm,  the  Aufsichtsrat  must 
have  between  one-third  and  one-half  worker  membership.  The 
Betriebsrat  is  composed  entirely  of  employee  representatives. 

The  result  of  forty  years  of  codetermination  is  the  kind  of 
bargain  typical  of  the  way  the  German  economy  is  managed. 
Management  can  largely  direct  the  functioning  of  the  com- 
pany. It  makes  investment,  financial,  operational,  and  market 
decisions,  but  it  makes  those  decisions  through  a  mechanism 
in  which  labor  can  have  a  voice.  Labor  can  make  certain  that 
the  conditions  under  which  the  workers  operate  are  socially 
acceptable.  It  can  also  make  certain  that  the  workers  benefit 
from  the  company's  well-being.  But  labor  in  turn  has  a  stake  in 
ensuring  that  the  demands  and  actions  of  the  workers  do  not 
jeopardize  the  firm  itself. 

In  addition  to  their  participation  in  company  management, 
German  workers  are  also  represented  in  trade  unions.  The 
principal  organization  is  the  Federation  of  German  Trade 
Unions  (Deutscher  Gewerkschaftsbund — DGB),  an  umbrella 
organization  that  joins  seventeen  trade  unions  along  industry 
lines  that  match  those  of  the  BDA  (see  Labor  Unions,  ch.  7). 
Trade  union  membership  is  not  obligatory  in  Germany.  Less 
than  one-half  of  all  West  German  workers  belonged  to  the 
trade  unions  in  1989,  but  German  unification  has  led  to  a  rise 
in  trade  union  membership  in  absolute  and  percentage  terms 
because  the  East  German  workers  were  accustomed  to  union 
membership. 

Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fishing 
Agriculture 

Agriculture  is  a  small  sector  of  the  German  economy  (see 


283 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

table  13,  Appendix).  It  has  declined  in  importance  all  during 
the  twentieth  century  and  by  1989  amounted  to  only  1.6  per- 
cent of  West  German  GDP.  Although  agriculture's  share  of  East 
German  GDP  was  twice  as  high  as  in  the  west,  even  after  the 
two  economies  are  completely  united,  agriculture's  share  of 
GDP  is  expected  to  amount  to  only  about  2  percent.  However, 
despite  the  sector's  small  size,  it  remains  politically  important. 

The  number  of  farms  had  decreased  steadily  in  West  Ger- 
many, from  1.6  million  in  1950  to  630,000  in  1990.  In  East  Ger- 
many, where  farms  were  collectivized  under  the  socialist 
regime,  there  had  been  about  5,100  agricultural  production 
collectives  with  an  average  of  4,100  hectares  under  cultivation. 
Since  unification,  about  three-quarters  of  the  collectives  have 
remained  as  cooperatives,  partnerships,  or  joint-stock  compa- 
nies. The  others  were  returned  to  their  original  owners — if 
those  owners  could  be  found — or  were  privately  sold,  becom- 
ing about  14,000  private  farms.  In  western  Germany  and  in  the 
newly  privatized  farms  in  eastern  Germany,  family  farms  pre- 
dominate. For  the  630,000  farms,  there  are  750,000  full-time 
employees.  There  are  also,  however,  many  more  part-time 
employees,  and  most  farms  do  not  represent  their  owners'  full- 
time  occupation. 

Although  the  number  of  farms  has  declined,  production  has 
actually  increased  through  more  efficient  production  methods. 
By  the  early  1990s,  a  single  farmer  could  produce  enough  food 
for  seventy-five  persons,  far  more  than  was  the  case  in  the  1950s 
or  1960s. 

Agricultural  products  vary  from  region  to  region.  In  the  flat 
terrain  of  northern  Germany  and  especially  in  the  eastern  por- 
tions, cereals  and  sugar  beets  are  grown.  Elsewhere,  with  the 
terrain  more  hilly  and  even  mountainous,  farmers  produce 
vegetables,  milk,  pork,  or  beef  (see  table  14;  table  15,  Appen- 
dix). Almost  all  large  cities  are  surrounded  by  fruit  orchards 
and  vegetable  farms.  Most  river  valleys  in  southern  and  western 
Germany,  especially  along  the  Rhine  and  the  Main,  have  vine- 
yards. Beer  is  produced  mainly,  but  not  exclusively,  in  Bavaria. 

Since  the  1960s,  German  agricultural  policy  has  not  been 
made  in  Germany  but  in  the  EC.  All  agricultural  laws  and  regu- 
lations are  written  in  Brussels,  often  after  difficult  negotiations 
between  food-producing  and  food-consuming  states.  The  main 
objective  of  those  negotiations  is  to  obtain  high  incomes  for 
the  farmers  while  keeping  market  prices  low  enough  to  avoid 
consumer  protests.  To  make  up  the  difference,  the  EC  adopted 


284 


The  Domestic  Economy 


the  Common  Agricultural  Policy  (CAP — see  Glossary)  subsidy 
program  and  the  export  subsidy  program,  both  of  which  bene- 
fit German  farmers  as  well  as  other  EU  farmers.  In  return,  the 
German  farmers  have  complied  with  European  directives  on 
the  quality  and  quantity  of  production. 

Forestry 

Germany  also  has  significant  lumber  production.  Almost 
one-third  of  Germany's  total  land  area,  especially  in  the  south, 
is  forested.  German  forests  produce  nearly  40  million  cubic 
meters  of  timber  every  year,  satisfying  two-thirds  of  domestic 
demand.  However,  Germany  has  to  import  most  of  its  hard- 
wood. 

There  has  been  growing  concern  for  decades  about  environ- 
mental damage  to  Germany's  forests.  By  the  1970s,  trees  were 
losing  their  needles  or  leaves  and  were  growing  less  full  than  in 
the  past  (see  The  Environment,  ch.  3).  A  number  of  laws  and 
regulations  have  attempted  to  stem  this  phenomenon,  which 
the  Germans  call  Waldsterben  (death  of  the  forest).  The  Forest 
Preservation  and  Forestry  Promotion  Act  was  passed  in  West 
Germany  in  1975  to  prevent  destructive  and  wasteful  timber 
policies.  It  now  applies  to  all  of  Germany.  Under  the  act,  forest 
owners  must  return  cut  areas  to  their  original  condition,  con- 
verting forests  into  timber  farms  in  which  the  cut  trees  are 
replaced  by  seedlings.  This  policy  works  better  for  pine  than 
for  other  timber.  However,  despite  legislation  and  the  great 
attention  paid  to  the  forests,  no  lasting  solution  has  yet  been 
found.  As  a  result  of  the  decades  of  ecological  damage,  many 
German  forests,  including  the  highland  Black  Forest  in  the 
southwest,  are  badly  depleted. 

Fishing 

The  German  fishing  industry  also  suffers  from  depletion, 
because  its  principal  fishing  grounds  have  become  overfished 
by  the  many  modern  fishing  fleets  that  enter  North  European 
waters.  German  vessels  have  long  fished  the  North  Sea,  the  Bal- 
tic Sea,  and  the  Atlantic  Ocean  off  the  British  Isles  and  around 
Greenland,  all  areas  where  many  competing  fishing  fleets  also 
operate.  The  German  ocean-fishing  fleet  has  shrunk.  Germany 
attempted  through  the  EC  to  establish  rules  that  would  prevent 
overfishing,  but  those  rules  have  proved  difficult  to  enforce.

Industry 

Manufacturing 

The  German  economy  is  essentially  a  processing  economy. 
This  was  true  of  both  West  Germany  and  East  Germany  before 
unification.  It  will  remain  true  in  the  future,  although  the 
detailed  shares  of  GDP  remain  to  be  determined  by  unification 
and  may  not  be  clearly  evident  until  the  mid-  or  late  1990s. 

Before  unification,  40  percent  of  the  German  workforce  was 
involved  in  manufacturing,  with  the  main  industries  being 
machine  tools,  automotive  manufacturing,  electrical  engineer- 
ing, iron,  steel,  chemicals,  and  optics.  Although  the  industrial 
sector  in  the  former  East  Germany  is  still  evolving,  manufactur- 
ing in  that  part  of  Germany  is  expected  to  concentrate  in  the 
same  industries  over  time.  Thus,  the  future  German  economy 
will  retain  a  powerful  industrial  component  that  will  likely  total 
well  above  30  percent  of  German  GDP. 

Almost  all  areas  of  western  Germany  have  some  industry. 
The  main  industrial  areas  are  the  Ruhr  district  in  North  Rhine- 
Westphalia,  the  traditional  center  of  German  coal,  steel,  and 
heavy  industry;  the  concentration  of  industry  around  several 
large  cities,  such  as  Hanover,  Munich,  Frankfurt  am  Main,  and 
Stuttgart;  the  chemical  production  areas  that  stretch  mainly 
along  the  Rhine  River  in  Baden-Wurttemberg  and  farther 
north;  and  the  automotive  manufacturing  centers,  increasingly 
concentrated  in  southern  Germany  in  Bavaria  and  Baden- 
Wurttemberg. 

In  eastern  Germany,  the  main  industrial  manufacturing 
areas  are  in  Saxony,  Saxony-Anhalt,  and  Thuringia,  principally 
concentrated  in  the  Leipzig,  Dresden,  Halle,  and  Chemnitz 
regions.  Before  World  War  II,  Saxony  was  the  technology  cen- 
ter of  Central  Europe.  The  Elbe  River,  like  the  Rhine,  attracted 
chemical  and  other  industry  along  its  shores.  It  is  uncertain 
which  eastern  German  industries  will  survive,  but  the  firms  in 
the  southern  part  of  the  region  appear  to  have  better  chances 
than  those  farther  north.  Even  before  unification,  more  indus- 
try was  concentrated  in  the  south  than  in  the  north.  The  dis- 
tricts in  northern  East  Germany  had  industrial  employment 
below  25  percent,  those  around  Berlin  had  industrial  employ- 
ment between  25  and  35  percent,  and  those  south  of  Berlin 
had  over  35  percent  employment  in  industry.  No  such  clear 
geographical  delineation  for  sector  employment  existed  in 
West  Germany.

The  Domestic  Economy 


The  glory  of  German  industry  is  not  in  the  big  firms  that  are 
well  known  around  the  world,  such  as  Daimler-Benz,  Volks- 
wagen, Siemens,  or  Bayer  (see  table  16,  Appendix).  It  is  in  the 
small-  and  medium-sized  firms  that  constitute  what  the  Ger- 
mans call  the  Mittelstand.  Although  that  term  has  political  and 
social  as  well  as  management  connotations,  it  has  been  widely 
accepted  to  mean  companies  that  employ  fewer  than  500  work- 
ers. Such  firms  constitute  98  percent  of  all  German  companies, 
hire  80  percent  of  all  employees,  are  responsible  for  a  signifi- 
cant share  of  exports,  and  provide  one  of  the  firmest  founda- 
tions of  the  middle  class. 

The  government  has  supported  and  furthered  the  Mittel- 
stand, in  part  for  political  reasons,  but  also  because  it  makes  a 
crucial  contribution  to  the  economy.  The  government  has 
established  special  provisions  that  permit  those  firms  to  coop- 
erate if  they  do  not  thereby  hinder  competition.  It  makes  avail- 
able special  funds  to  promote  research  and  development  by 
Mittelstand  companies.  After  unification,  the  government  used 
investment  and  tax  incentives  to  encourage  Mittelstand  compa- 
nies to  invest  in  eastern  Germany. 

The  single  most  successful  German  industry  is  mechanical 
engineering,  with  a  total  turnover  in  1991  of  DM240  billion. 
Unlike  many  industries  in  Germany  and  elsewhere,  it  is  domi- 
nated by  small  rather  than  large  companies.  It  includes  over 
4,000  firms  throughout  Germany.  Only  3  percent  of  the  com- 
panies have  more  than  1,000  employees.  German  mechanical 
engineering  has  a  range  of  more  than  17,000  products.  Almost 
two-thirds  of  the  products  are  exported. 

The  best-known  industry  and  the  second-largest,  with  a  turn- 
over of  DM217  billion  in  1991,  is  automotive  manufacturing. 
Such  companies  as  Daimler-Benz,  Volkswagen,  and  Bayerische 
Motorenwerke  (BMW)  are  known  throughout  the  world. 
Almost  half  of  all  German-produced  automobiles  are  exported, 
mainly  to  other  EU  members  and  to  North  America. 

Electrical  engineering  ranks  third  in  importance  among 
German  industries,  with  a  turnover  of  DM207  billion  in  1991. 
The  biggest  single  firm  is  Siemens,  although  Bosch  also  ranks 
among  Germany's  largest  companies.  Products  range  from 
giant  electric  generating  turbines  exported  all  over  the  world 
to  smaller  electric  engines  and  some  consumer  goods. 

The  chemical  industry,  with  a  total  output  of  DM166  billion 
in  1991,  is  based  principally  on  three  large  corporations  that 
have  been  leaders  in  the  field  for  100  years — Hoechst,  Bayer, 


287 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 


and  BASF.  There  are  also  many  medium-sized  companies. 
About  one-half  of  the  industry's  products  are  exported. 

Other  important  industries  are  the  traditional  German 
industries  of  steel  and  coal  mining,  both  heavily  subsidized  and 
still  large  employers.  Precision  engineering  remains  a  strong 
area.  Aerospace  is  a  small  but  growing  industry,  also  heavily 
subsidized,  and  German  companies  often  join  with  companies 
from  other  EU  countries — such  as  Airbus  and  military  aircraft 
production  (see  fig.  10). 

One  reason  to  believe  that  the  eastern  and  western  portions 
of  the  united  Germany  will  again  knit  together  into  one  large 
manufacturing  economy  is  that  such  an  economy  has  been  part 
of  the  German  tradition  for  centuries  and  that  both  Germanys 
have  specialized  in  the  same  general  industrial  sectors.  Some 
analysts  contend  that  the  eastern  economy  will  even  have  a 
competitive  edge  later  in  the  1990s  because  of  the  vast  sums 
being  invested  in  modernizing  its  industrial  plant. 

Energy  and  Natural  Resources 

Like  most  modern  states,  Germany  relies  principally  on  fos- 
sil fuels  as  sources  of  energy.  About  40  percent  of  German 
energy  consumption  comes  from  petroleum,  largely  for  trucks 
and  automobiles.  About  30  percent  comes  from  domestic  coal 
deposits,  half  from  lignite,  or  brown  coal,  in  the  east  and  the 
other  half  from  anthracite  located  in  the  west.  Natural  gas  pro- 
vides about  17  percent  of  energy  consumed,  and  nuclear 
energy  about  10  percent.  Other  sources  of  energy,  such  as 
hydroelectric,  solar,  or  wind-powered  electric  power  plants,  are 
relatively  insignificant.  Most  production  is  in  private  hands. 

Electrical  power  comes  almost  equally  from  three  sources: 
the  largest  (31  percent)  is  generated  by  lignite,  the  next  largest 
(28  percent)  from  nuclear  reactors,  and  the  third  largest  (26 
percent)  from  anthracite.  Natural  gas  provides  about  7  per- 
cent. Those  proportions  will  undoubtedly  shift  over  time 
because  of  the  high  pollution  levels  generated  by  the  relatively 
inefficient  lignite,  especially  in  the  new  Lander,  where  it 
accounts  for  over  90  percent  of  electricity  production  (see 
table  17,  Appendix).  The  public's  aversion  to  nuclear  power 
that  developed  in  Germany  in  the  1980s  will  likewise  cause  this 
source  of  power  to  become  less  important.  Natural  gas  will 
become  more  significant. 

The  necessary  reduction  of  brown  coal  consumption  is 
unfortunate  for  the  nation's  economy  because  it  and  anthracite 


288 


The  Domestic  Economy 


are  Germany's  only  significant  natural  resources.  As  of  1993, 
Germany  was  the  world's  largest  producer  of  brown  coal,  min- 
ing nearly  twice  as  much  as  the  next  greatest  producer,  Russia. 
Anthracite  mining  is  also  significant,  and  Germany  was  the 
world's  ninth  greatest  producer  of  this  substance  in  1993. 

Germany  has  over  twenty  nuclear  reactors,  most  of  them 
small  and  having  production  levels  below  2,000  megawatts  per 
reactor.  It  has  virtually  no  domestic  uranium  deposits  and  must 
import  enriched  uranium  for  its  reactors.  Most  of  the  reactors 
in  operation  in  the  early  1990s  were  built  during  the  1970s  and 
early  1980s.  Reliance  on  nuclear  power  has  become  controver- 
sial, however.  Because  of  the  controversy,  no  new  nuclear  reac- 
tor has  entered  service  since  1988.  A  number  of  older  reactors 
dating  to  the  1960s  have  ceased  operations.  A  major  interna- 
tional energy  crisis  would  be  needed  to  renew  impetus  in  Ger- 
many's nuclear  energy  program  because  the  country  is  densely 
populated,  and  most  of  its  inhabitants  do  not  want  a  reactor 
near  their  houses  or  offices. 

Germany  must  import  almost  all  the  oil  and  gas  that  it  uses. 
In  1993  the  three  largest  suppliers  of  crude  petroleum  were 
Norway  (18.4  percent  of  the  total),  the  Commonwealth  of 
Independent  States  (CIS — see  Glossary)  (17.4  percent),  and 
Britain  (12.4  percent)  (see  table  18,  Appendix).  Germany  has 
its  own  modest  oil  deposits,  estimated  in  1990  at  50  million 
tons,  in  the  North  German  Plain.  It  has  a  share  of  North  Sea 
gas  reserves  and  production,  with  reserves  estimated  in  1990  at 
9.9  billion  cubic  meters.  But  these  are  not  adequate  long-term 
sources.  Thus,  Germany  will  increase  its  imports  of  oil  and  gas, 
most  likely  from  Russia.  East  Germany  relied  heavily  on  Soviet 
gas  before  unification,  and  united  Germany  will  want  to  pur- 
chase petrochemicals  from  Russia  to  enable  Russia  to  pay  for 
the  German  manufactures  that  Russia  is  purchasing. 

Like  all  modern  economies,  Germany  has  become  increas- 
ingly cost  conscious  and  conservation  conscious  about  energy 
consumption.  Whereas  GDP  in  West  Germany  rose  by  about  50 
percent  from  1973  to  the  early  1990s,  energy  consumption  rose 
by  only  7  percent.

Deutsche  Bundesbank  (commonly  called  the  Bundesbank).  It 
has  the  dominant  voice  in  German  monetary  policy.  Through 
that  voice,  it  establishes  and  maintains  a  firm  policy  in  favor  of 
solid  currency  value  within  Germany  and  increasingly  within 
the  EU  and  even  the  world  at  large. 

If  a  central  bank's  reputation  is  its  most  precious  asset,  the 
Bundesbank  is  among  the  world's  most  highly  endowed  institu- 
tions. Its  contribution  to  the  economic  and  political  stability  of 


290 


The  Domestic  Economy 


West  Germany  and  Western  Europe  in  the  postwar  years  was 
almost  legendary  and  was  given  due  respect  even  by  those  who 
disagreed  with  some  or  many  of  its  policies. 

Although  the  Bundesbank  often  appears  to  be  the  principal 
maker  of  German  economic  policy,  its  exact  powers  are  care- 
fully set  forth  and  circumscribed  in  the  1957  law  establishing 
the  bank.  The  law  assigned  to  the  bank  the  responsibility  for 
"the  preservation  of  the  value  of  German  currency,"  a  mandate 
that  was  so  important  that  it  was  clearly  intended  to  override 
the  bank's  other  principal  task,  "to  support  the  general  eco- 
nomic policy  of  the  federal  government."  Even  the  latter  task 
was  carefully  limited  by  the  specific  provision  that  the  bank 
"shall  be  independent  of  instructions  from  the  federal  govern- 
ment." 

The  government  does  have  a  role,  if  it  wishes  to  exercise  it. 
Government  representatives  can  and  at  times  do  attend  the 
meetings  of  the  bank's  governing  board,  the  Central  Bank 
Council  (see  Glossary),  although  the  government  cannot  block 
the  bank's  actions  but  is  authorized  only  to  delay  them  for  no 
longer  than  two  weeks.  There  are  also  informal  contacts 
between  the  government  and  the  bank,  and  it  is  not  unusual 
for  senior  officials  at  the  Chancellory  or  the  Ministry  of 
Finance  to  know  in  advance  what  the  council  might  be 
expected  to  decide  at  its  next  meeting. 

The  bank  has  more  authority  in  the  realm  of  monetary  pol- 
icy than  any  other  major  European  central  bank.  It  is  most 
closely  based,  at  least  in  its  structure  although  not  in  its  formal 
mandate,  on  the  United  States  Federal  Reserve  Bank.  It  exer- 
cises more  functions  than  the  Federal  Reserve,  however,  in  part 
because  it  carries  out  some  exchange  responsibilities  that  are 
assigned  to  the  United  States  Department  of  the  Treasury.  The 
Bundesbank  issues  money  and  makes  monetary  policy  by  con- 
trolling short-term  interest  rates  such  as  the  discount  rate  for 
loans  to  other  banks  and  the  Lombard  rate  (see  Glossary)  for 
short-term  funding  for  business. 

As  of  mid-1995,  the  president  of  the  Bundesbank  was  Hans 
Tietmeyer,  who  made  his  mark  in  the  economics  and  finance 
ministries  as  a  career  official  and  then  as  a  state  secretary.  Kohl 
appointed  him  Bundesbank  president  in  1993.  The  Bundes- 
bank's Central  Bank  Council  has  seventeen  members,  with  the 
majority  of  nine  being  the  presidents  of  regional  or  Land  cen- 
tral banks.  The  representatives  of  these  banks  can,  therefore, 
outnumber  the  eight  members  of  the  Central  Bank  Council 


291 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

who  work  out  of  the  bank's  executive  office  in  Frankfurt  am 
Main,  the  Direktorium  (Directorate — see  Glossary),  giving  the 
bank  a  strong  orientation  toward  developments  in  the  country 
as  a  whole,  while  public  and  foreign  attention  usually  concen- 
trates on  the  Directorate.  Land  central  bank  presidents  are 
nominated  by  Land  governments.  They  do  not  serve  at  any  gov- 
ernment's pleasure,  including  that  of  the  Land  that  nominated 
them.  The  members  of  the  council  who  are  in  the  Directorate 
are  appointed  by  the  president  upon  the  nomination  of  the 
chancellor,  but  even  these  members  are  not  subject  to  govern- 
ment direction. 

The  single  most  important  fact  about  the  Bundesbank,  how- 
ever, is  its  powerful  and  consistent  anti-inflationary  philosophy. 
That  philosophy,  grounded  in  its  absolute  determination  to 
avoid  the  social  upheaval  caused  by  the  Great  Inflation  of  the 
early  1920s,  is  central  to  the  bank's  thinking  on  every  occasion 
and  has  given  it  enormous  influence.  Although  a  number  of 
economists,  especially  some  in  the  United  States,  have  long 
argued  that  the  Bundesbank's  policies  are  excessively  restrictive 
and  potentially  deflationary,  the  bank  is  popular  with  most 
German  voters  and  with  much  of  German  business.  The  voters 
do  not  wish  to  see  their  savings  eroded  by  inflation.  Business- 
men are  inclined  to  believe  that  a  lower  inflation  rate  will  per- 
mit them  to  hold  down  their  costs  and  remain  highly 
competitive  over  the  long  run  although  others  might  receive 
some  temporary  advantage  from  devaluation.  Germans  believe 
that  a  country  with  a  stable  currency  will  be  able  to  have  lower 
capital  and  labor  costs  because  lower  inflation  expectations 
make  lower  interest  rates  and  stable  wages  acceptable. 

German  demographic  realities  have  added  further  reasons 
for  anti-inflationary  policies.  As  the  population  ages  and  as 
more  Germans  live  on  pensions  or  on  fixed  investment 
incomes,  the  importance  of  price  stability  has  become  a  power- 
ful consideration  for  a  growing  sector  of  the  electorate.  That 
sector  of  the  electorate  fully  supports  the  Bundesbank's  anti- 
inflationary  policies. 

Banking  and  Its  Role  in  the  Economy 

The  German  economy  is  a  bank  economy,  with  the  main 
role  in  finance  and  credit  being  played  by  commercial  and  sav- 
ings banks  while  other  forms  of  credit  are  secondary.  Banks 
provide  most  of  the  country's  investment  capital  because  of  the 
high  German  savings  rate  and  because  most  Germans  prefer  to

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

put  those  savings  into  banks  rather  than  into  stocks  or  bonds. 
As  with  many  other  German  economic  phenomena,  this  bank 
role  is  not  new.  Banks  have  played  a  central  role  in  German 
financial  and  economic  history  since  the  Middle  Ages. 

German  banks  function  as  universal  banks,  able  to  offer  a 
full  range  of  banking,  saving,  foreign  exchange,  and  invest- 
ment services  to  their  depositors  and  clients.  They  hold  funds 
or  other  assets,  broker  securities,  underwrite  equity  issues,  give 
advice  on  asset  placement,  manage  accounts,  and  so  on.  About 
one-quarter  of  German  banks  are  commercial.  Most  of  the 
remainder  are  savings  banks,  mainly  owned  locally  or  region- 
ally and  operating  under  public  statutes,  or  cooperatives  that 
perform  such  specialized  services  as  agricultural,  crafts,  or 
mortgage  lending. 

The  three  best  known  and  most  important  German  universal 
banks — the  Deutsche  Bank,  the  Dresdner  Bank,  and  the  Com- 
merzbank — are  omnipresent  throughout  unified  Germany  and 
have  immense  influence.  These  banks  opened  hundreds  of 
new  offices  in  the  east  during  unification  and  sent  large  staffs 
of  bankers  to  manage  offices  and  to  train  permanent  person- 
nel there.  In  effect,  they  were  the  principal  agents  for  control 
of  Germany's  economic  unification. 

But  the  "big  three,"  as  they  are  often  known,  are  not  the  only 
large  banks  in  Germany.  A  number  of  other  banks,  including 
regional  banks,  are  even  more  important  than  the  big  three 
within  their  areas  of  operations.  The  DG  Bank,  which  operates 
out  of  Frankfurt  am  Main,  has  a  higher  nominal  capital  stock 
than  that  of  the  Commerzbank.  The  Westdeutsche  Landes- 
bank,  headquartered  in  Dusseldorf  and  owned  in  part  by  the 
Land  of  North  Rhine-Westphalia,  has  a  higher  nominal  capital 
stock  value  than  that  of  the  Deutsche  Bank.  The  value  of  the 
combined  nominal  stock  of  the  three  major  banks  in  Bavaria  is 
even  higher,  and  those  banks  have  helped  finance  the  eco- 
nomic boom  in  southern  Germany.  Other  major  banks  exist  in 
other  Lander,  often  owned  in  part  by  the  Lander  themselves  with 
additional  capital  coming  from  state-wide  savings  associations 
or  other  local  institutions.  An  important  element  in  the  Ger- 
man savings  system  is  the  Postbank,  the  postal  savings  bank, 
with  2V, 000  employees.  Almost  one  in  three  Germans  has  an 
account  in  the  Postbank,  using  it  for  savings  and  for  personal 
financial  transactions  such  as  paying  monthly  bills  in  prefer- 
ence to  bank  accounts.  The  Postbank  has  24  million  savings 


294 


The  Domestic  Economy 


accounts  and  hopes  to  branch  into  other  areas  of  financial  ser- 
vices. 

The  most  important  and  most  controversial  aspect  of  Ger- 
man banking  is  the  role  that  banks  play  as  shareholders  and 
policy  makers  in  the  country's  industrial  firms.  It  has  been  esti- 
mated that  banks  directly  or  indirectly  hold  more  than  25  per- 
cent of  the  voting  capital  in  one-quarter  of  Germany's  largest 
corporations  and  hold  about  28  percent  of  all  seats  on  the 
supervisory  boards.  The  banks  are  empowered  to  vote  not  only 
their  own  shares  but  also,  by  proxy,  shares  that  they  hold  for 
their  clients.  Although  there  are  indications  that  the  banks' 
ownership  proportion  of  major  firms  has  been  reduced  over 
time  as  other  sources  of  investment  funds  have  become  more 
available,  the  combined  influence  and  presence  of  the  banks  is 
considerable.  They  are  even  said  to  pool  information  on  the 
basis  of  which  they  steer  investments  throughout  the  economy. 

According  to  a  Commerzbank  listing  of  ownership  of  10,000 
large  West  German  companies,  the  Deutsche  Bank  owns  shares 
in  seventy-seven  different  firms,  the  Dresdner  Bank  in  fifty-five, 
and  the  Commerzbank  in  forty-eight.  Other  smaller  banks  are 
also  widely  invested.  The  Commerzbank  listing  did  not  show 
the  bond  or  loan  holdings  of  the  banks  or  the  votes  they  exer- 
cised in  proxy,  but  it  did  show  that  in  pure  ownership  terms 
alone  the  banks  have  a  strong  voice  in  a  significant  number  of 
major  German  companies.  The  positions  that  the  banks  hold 
could  afford  wide  opportunities  to  influence  industrial  deci- 
sion making,  although  they  are  not  the  kinds  of  true  monopoly 
positions  that  earlier  German  cartel  arrangements  offered. 

A  mid-1980s  study  by  the  government  agency  that  examines 
potential  monopolies,  the  Monopolkommission,  looking  only 
at  major  companies,  concluded  that  the  three  major  banks 
could  vote  well  over  three-quarters  of  the  shares  of  many  major 
German  corporations  and  that  all  banks  together  had  even 
greater  voting  authority.  The  power  of  the  banks  also  is  evident 
in  the  seats  they  hold  on  the  boards  of  the  country's  most 
important  corporations,  with  bank  presidents  or  representa- 
tives sitting  on  the  boards  of  every  major  German  firm. 

The  banks  do  not  appear  to  want  to  seize  industrial  power  or 
make  production  decisions.  They  would  be  hard  put  to  exer- 
cise monopoly  power,  and  their  actions  on  individual  boards 
are  clearly  subject  to  enough  scrutiny — at  least  by  other  board 
members — that  improper  actions  would  become  widely  known. 
German  business  is  prepared  to  accept  the  power  and  influ- 


295 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

ence  of  the  banks  and  to  see  it  perpetuated.  Nonetheless,  the 
direction  of  bank  influence  probably  adds  a  conservative  ele- 
ment to  German  economic  decision  making  because  banks  tra- 
ditionally prefer  to  avoid  risk-taking  in  favor  of  slow  but  steady 
dividends  and  debt  repayment.  They  also  could  be  accused  of 
becoming  new  masters  of  German  cartel-like  structures,  with 
banks  directing  separate  firms  toward  similar  policies  even  if 
the  firms  themselves  are  not  colluding. 

The  role  of  the  banks  in  the  economy  has  raised  questions. 
Some  political  figures,  including  FDP  leader  Otto  Lambsdorff, 
have  charged  that  the  banks  have  accumulated  excessive 
power.  Newspapers  and  magazines,  including  business  jour- 
nals, periodically  make  the  same  charge.  But  there  are  no  indi- 
cations that  the  system  is  changing  or  will  change  in  response 
to  those  criticisms.  One  could  even  argue  that  it  is  more  perva- 
sive than  ever,  as  banks  now  also  play  roles  in  managing  former 
East  German  firms  that  were  privatized  with  western  bank 
funds. 

Nonbank  Financing 

Ever  since  the  collapse  of  the  Berlin  stock  exchange  after 
Hitler's  seizure  of  power  in  1933,  Germany  has  lacked  a  major 
international  market  for  bonds  and  equities.  Nothing  in  Ger- 
many rivals  those  of  New  York  or  Tokyo,  and  even  the  London 
market  does  more  overall  trading  than  Frankfurt.  London  even 
trades  almost  one-third  of  all  German  shares.  There  are  now 
ten  regional  exchanges  in  Germany,  but  no  single  exchange  is 
very  large. 

To  help  promote  nonbank  financing  and  a  greater  German 
interest  in  equities,  the  German  government  has  launched  a 
drive  for  what  it  terms  Finanzplatz  Deutschland,  making  stock 
and  bond  trading  easier  in  Germany  and  subordinating  the 
roles  of  the  smaller  exchanges  to  the  Frankfurt  exchange  as  the 
major  site  for  German  nonbank  finance.  Proposals  include  a 
futures  market,  improved  electronic  links  among  regional  mar- 
kets, some  computerized  trading,  longer  opening  hours,  free- 
dom for  firms  to  issue  commercial  paper,  and  the  elimination 
of  a  small  but  annoying  German  turnover  tax  on  securities 
transactions.  They  also  include  tighter  national  supervision  to 
prevent  misuse  of  the  exchanges  and  of  new  methods  of 
finance.  Finally,  there  are  tight  restrictions  on  insider  training, 
and  a  supervisory  organization  that  will  correspond  to  the 


296 


The  Domestic  Economy 


Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  in  the  United  States  is 
being  created. 

The  smaller  regional  exchanges  have  objected  that  some  of 
the  steps  proposed  under  the  Finanzplatz  Deutschland  pro- 
posal violate  the  federal  principle  on  which  postwar  West  Ger- 
many had  been  founded,  and  they  have  been  supported  by  the 
Land  governments  that  do  not  want  Frankfurt  to  have  too 
much  power.  Therefore,  not  all  parts  of  the  government  plan 
have  been  carried  out  as  soon  as  its  proponents  wished.  None- 
theless, an  important  step  has  been  taken  in  the  merger  of  the 
Frankfurt  stock  exchange  and  the  German  futures  and  options 
exchanges,  the  Deutsche  Terminborse  (DTB). 

Despite  such  measures  to  encourage  equity  placements, 
most  German  firms  still  do  not  seek  equity  financing,  and  even 
if  they  do,  they  often  work  through  banks  to  obtain  it.  West 
Germany  had  370,000  limited  liability  companies  or  closed  cor- 
porations (Ges ells chaf ten  mit  beschrankter  Haftung — GmbH)  as 
against  2,300  corporations  (Aktiengesellschaften — AG).  Of  those, 
only  619  had  their  shares  quoted  on  the  markets  at  the  end  of 
1990,  and  the  number  thereafter  grew  only  slowly.  There  has 
been  no  upsurge  toward  new  equity  finance  as  a  result  of  unifi- 
cation, with  many  East  German  firms  being  taken  over  by  West 
German  firms  and  with  banks  supplying  the  needed  financing 
as  well  as  sitting  on  new  boards.  Although  there  are  some  signs 
that  German  firms  appear  to  be  turning  increasingly  to 
exchanges  for  funds,  and  the  volume  of  such  placements 
increased  over  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s,  many  firms  still 
feel  more  comfortable  with  their  established  banking  links. 

A  step  that  may  lead  to  a  greater  financial  role  for  Frankfurt 
in  Germany  itself  as  well  as  in  Europe  has  been  the  EU's  1994 
decision  to  place  the  new  European  central  bank  in  Frankfurt 
when  that  bank  is  established.  This  would  reinforce  Frankfurt's 
place  as  the  center  of  the  European  Monetary  Union  (EMU — 
see  Glossary)  and  also  as  the  center  of  German  finance  (see 
Germany  and  the  European  Monetary  Union,  ch.  6).  Berlin's 
emergence  as  a  center  for  trade  and  services  with  Eastern 
Europe  might  over  time  boost  Berlin's  prospects  as  an  alterna- 
tive center  of  German  finance.

cated  transportation  systems.  This  reflects  the  intensely  mobile 
nature  of  the  German  population,  who  are  among  the  world's 
most  active  drivers,  tourists,  and  travelers.  It  also  reflects  Ger- 
many's location  in  the  center  of  Europe  and  the  many  far- 
reaching  industrial  and  commercial  relationships  developed 
over  centuries.  Because  of  the  density  of  the  network,  many 
towns,  but  especially  such  major  cities  as  Berlin,  Frankfurt  am 
Main,  Munich,  and  Hamburg,  function  as  transportation  and 
communications  centers,  lying  either  at  the  intersections  of 
major  east-west  and  north-south  routes  or  on  transshipment 
points  of  ship,  barge,  road,  and  railroad  traffic.  With  Europe 
again  uniting  from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Urals,  Germany's  posi- 
tion as  a  transportation  and  communications  hub  for  the  conti- 
nent will  become  ever  more  important. 

To  cope  with  the  additional  demands  caused  by  German  and 
European  unification,  the  German  government  has  designated 
seventeen  major  transport  routes  to  be  either  completed  or 
rebuilt  as  soon  as  possible  during  the  last  decade  of  the  twenti- 
eth century  and  the  first  decade  of  the  twenty-first  century.  The 
first  transport  plan  for  newly  united  Germany  was  adopted  in 
1993  and  will  cost  DM453  billion  by  the  year  2012.  More  than 
half  of  the  investment  will  be  dedicated  to  rail  and  waterway 
travel,  not  road  travel  (see  fig.  11). 

Trucks  have  been  the  most  important  instrument  for  freight 
transport  throughout  Germany  for  decades.  They  carried  203 
billion  ton-kilometers  of  freight  in  1992,  with  railroads  second 
(83  billion  ton-kilometers)  and  inland  shipping  (55  billion  ton- 
kilometers)  third.  But  the  railroad  system  is  also  perceived  as 
very  important,  and  it  will  be  extensively  modernized.  The 
Deutsche  Bahn  railroad  company,  formed  in  January  1994 
from  the  East  German  and  West  German  railroad  systems  and 
to  be  gradually  privatized,  has  a  network  of  over  40,000  kilome- 
ters at  standard  1.435  meter  gauge,  of  which  16,000  kilometers 
are  electrified.  Perhaps  8,000  kilometers  of  German  railroad 
tracks  will  be  eliminated  through  rationalization.  To  speed  traf- 
fic, new  high-speed  railroad  tracks  have  been  designed  to  per- 
mit special  trains  to  move  at  up  to  250  kilometers  per  hour 
between  such  principal  cities  as  Hamburg  and  Munich,  with 
more  tracks  to  follow.  The  purpose  of  these  new  trains  is  to 
relieve  some  of  the  pressure  on  airports  by  making  surface 
transportation  fast  and  attractive  for  distances  of  fewer  than 
500  kilometers.

Figure  11.  Transportation  System,  1995 


Germany  has  one  of  the  densest  road  networks  in  the  world 
and  the  largest  after  the  United  States.  There  were  a  total  of 
226,000  kilometers  of  roads  in  1992,  including  more  than 
11,000  kilometers  of  four-or-more-lane  superhighways.  None- 
theless, especially  in  crowded  areas  and  for  the  long  routes 
toward  southern  Europe,  many  trucks  are  carried  piggyback  on 
trains  to  increase  speed  and  to  reduce  pollution.  The  former 
East  German  system  required  several  years  of  rebuilding  after

Germany  had  45  million  motor  vehicles  in  1992,  with  39  mil- 
lion automobiles.  Automobiles  accounted  for  some  685  billion 
passenger-kilometers  in  1990,  a  number  that  could  be  expected 
to  rise  rapidly  by  the  mid-1990s  as  the  eastern  German  popula- 
tion begins  to  acquire  automobiles  at  a  rate  similar  to  that  of 
their  compatriots  in  the  west.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

The  German  inland  shipping  system  is  one  of  the  world's 
most  highly  developed,  especially  because  of  the  large  flat  areas 
in  northern  and  western  Germany.  Duisburg,  located  in  north- 
western Germany  on  the  Rhine,  is  the  largest  inland  port  in  the 
world.  Germany  has  6,900  kilometers  of  navigable  inland  water- 
ways, including  such  principal  canals  as  the  Kiel  Canal,  the  Mit- 
telland  Canal,  and  the  Dortmund-Ems  Canal.  The  Rhine-Main- 
Danube  Canal,  completed  in  1992,  joins  the  Main  and  the 
Danube  rivers  in  northern  Bavaria  and  for  the  first  time  per- 
mits river  transport  between  the  North  Sea  and  the  Black  Sea 
(see  fig.  12). 

The  main  German  seaports  are  those  of  the  old  Hanseatic 
League,  with  the  best-known  being  Hamburg,  Bremen-Bremer- 
haven,  Wilhelmshaven,  Lubeck,  and  Rostock.  To  compensate 
for  their  greater  distance  from  the  Atlantic  Ocean  (in  compari- 
son with  Rotterdam),  German  ports  have  invested  heavily  in 
technology,  equipment,  and  training  that  permit  fast  and  eco- 
nomical loading  and  unloading. 

Germany  also  has  a  large  system  of  inland  and  international 
air  travel.  Lufthansa,  the  national  airline,  has  an  extensive 
domestic  and  global  route  system.  In  1992  approximately  87.5 
million  passengers  were  registered  at  Germany's  airports,  and 
1.5  million  tons  of  air  freight  were  carried  from  those  airports. 
The  largest  international  airport  is  Frankfurt-Rhein  Main, 
located  near  Frankfurt  am  Main  and  one  of  the  world's  most 
important  centers  for  both  passengers  and  air  freight.  Other 
important  airports  are  those  at  Dusseldorf,  Munich,  the  three 
serving  Berlin  (Berlin-Tegel,  Berlin-Schonefeld,  and  Berlin- 
Tempelhof),  Hamburg,  Stuttgart,  and  Cologne-Bonn.  Berlin- 
Schonefeld,  located  to  the  south  of  Berlin,  will  be  expanded  to 
reestablish  it  as  a  major  international  air  center. 

Telecommunications 

The  German  postal  services  are  among  the  oldest  in  Europe. 
In  1990  Germany  celebrated  500  years  of  organized  mail  ser- 
vice. At  the  same  time,  the  German  government  broke  up  the 
Bundespost  monopoly  over  all  forms  of  communications  and 
created  three  new  structures  to  handle  the  services  formerly 
handled  by  the  Bundespost. 

The  largest  of  the  new  services  is  the  Postdienst,  with 
390,000  employees.  It  is  Germany's  largest  service  enterprise, 
handling  over  15  billion  pieces  of  mail  every  year.  The  second 
largest  is  Telekom,  the  telephone/telex  service,  with  a  total  of 


302 


The  Domestic  Economy 


260,000  employees.  Telekom  is  intended  to  keep  the  German 
telecommunications  system  competitive  with  the  new  systems 
being  developed  in  the  United  States  and  Asia.  Germany  has  35 
million  telephones,  but  service  in  eastern  Germany  took  a  long 
time  to  come  up  to  western  German  standards.  The  third  is  the 
Postbank,  with  24,000  employees,  which  manages  the  postal 
savings  bank  system  in  which  about  30  million  Germans  have 
accounts  (see  Banking  and  Its  Role  in  the  Economy,  this  ch.). 

Tourism 

Germany  is  a  principal  attraction  for  foreign  tourists,  and 
the  Germans  themselves  are  among  the  world's  most  enthusias- 
tic tourists.  Although  Germany  attracts  millions  of  foreign  tour- 
ists, German  tourists  every  year  spend  tens  of  billions  of 
deutsche  marks  more  than  foreign  tourists  spend  in  Germany. 
In  fact,  tourism  constitutes  a  major  drain  on  German  foreign 
exchange. 

The  areas  that  attract  the  most  tourists  to  Germany  are  the 
Alps,  the  Rhine  and  Moselle  valleys,  and  several  large  cities, 
especially  Berlin.  But  those  are  not  the  only  attractions.  Music 
festivals  such  as  those  at  Bayreuth  and  Munich  draw  many  tour- 
ists. So  do  some  of  the  old  German  medieval  cities  like  Rothen- 
burg  ob  der  Tauber  and  Dinkelsbuhl.  Because  of  the  wealth  of 
hiking  and  bicycle  trails,  many  tourists  come  to  the  Black  For- 
est and  to  other  German  woodlands  and  mountains.  Since  uni- 
fication, tourists  have  increasingly  visited  the  former  East 
German  states  and  especially  the  Baltic  beaches  and  such  cities 
as  Leipzig  and  Dresden. 

Unlike  Austria  or  Spain,  Germany  does  not  regard  tourism 
as  a  major  source  of  foreign  exchange.  Hotel  stays  by  foreign 
visitors  to  Germany  do  not  rise  above  15  percent  of  total  occu- 
pancy, as  opposed  to  the  two-thirds  levels  that  they  reach  in 
those  countries.  But  as  many  as  1.5  million  jobs  in  Germany  are 
connected  in  one  way  or  another  to  the  tourist  industry. 

*  *  * 

The  literature  on  the  German  economy  is  surprisingly  lim- 
ited, given  its  importance  in  Europe  and  the  world  as  a  whole. 
German  economic  unification  produced  a  spate  of  books  and 
articles,  but  most  were  out  of  date  within  months  of  publica- 
tion. The  most  comprehensive  current  book  in  English  is  The 
German  Economy  by  W.R.  Smyser.  Another  survey  is  The  German 


303 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Economy  by  Eric  Owen  Smith. There  are  also  some  current 
books  that  deal  with  specialized  topics,  such  as  Banks,  Finance, 
and  Investment  in  Germany  by  Jeremy  S.S.  Edwards  and  Klaus 
Fischer.  The  Bundesbank  has  attracted  growing  attention,  with 
the  most  comprehensive  work  being  The  Bundesbank  by  David 
Marsh.  The  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and 
Development  publishes  an  annual  OECD  Economic  Survey  on 
Germany  as  well  as  a  special  section  on  Germany  in  its  biannual 
OECD  Economic  Outlook. 

There  is,  however,  a  rich  literature  about  the  specifics  of  the 
German  economy.  The  German  Council  of  Economic  Experts 
(Sachverstandigenrat  zur  Begutachtung  der  gesamtwirtschaft- 
lichen  Entwicklung)  publishes  an  extensive  annual  review  of 
the  German  economy  in  German,  and  the  German  economic 
institutes  continually  publish  specialized  papers  in  German 
and  sometimes  in  English.  The  Bundesbank  and  the  German 
Ministry  for  Economics  publish  monthly  and  annual  reports 
that  concentrate  on  financial  and  macroeconomic  information 
but  also  provide  a  general  economic  roundup.  The  bank  also 
publishes  a  dozen  statistical  annexes  every  month.  Both  pub- 
lish their  basic  reports  in  English  as  well  as  in  German.  Other 
German  ministries  as  well  as  the  German  Federal  Press  and 
Information  Office  provide  large  quantities  of  information  on 
a  regular  basis,  but  much  of  it  is  in  primary  form  and  requires 
analysis.  (For  further  information  and  complete  citations,  see 
Bibliography.)

The  port  of  Hamburg 


EVER  SINCE  ITS  CREATION  IN  1949,  the  Federal  Republic  of 
Germany  (FRG) ,  or  West  Germany,  as  it  was  also  called  until  its 
unification  in  1990  with  the  German  Democratic  Republic 
(GDR,  or  East  Germany),  has  played  an  increasingly  important 
role  in  the  world  economy.  Consistently  among  the  most 
important  trading  nations  in  the  world,  Germany  often  derives 
a  higher  share  of  its  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glos- 
sary) from  exports  than  any  other  major  state.  The  Federal 
Republic  plays  an  even  more  important  role  in  international 
financial  matters.  Its  currency,  the  deutsche  mark,  is  the  sec- 
ond most  important  currency  in  the  world  after  the  United 
States  dollar. 

Germany  does  not  act  alone  in  international  economic  mat- 
ters. Instead,  it  usually  acts  through  Europe.  West  Germany  was 
a  founding  member  of  the  European  Coal  and  Steel  Commu- 
nity (ECSC)  and  of  the  follow-on  European  Community  (EC — 
see  Glossary),  known  since  late  1993  as  the  European  Union 
(EU — see  Glossary).  Germany  increasingly  makes  its  interna- 
tional policies  in  conjunction  and  consultation  with  other  EU 
members.  More  than  half  of  its  trade  is  with  other  EU  states, 
and  the  deutsche  mark  is  the  anchor  of  the  European  Mone- 
tary System  (EMS — see  Glossary)  and  of  its  planned  follow-on, 
the  European  Monetary  Union  (EMU — see  Glossary). 

Despite  its  central  role  in  the  world  economy,  Germany  has 
never  developed  nor  sought  a  high  profile  as  a  major  interna- 
tional economic  player.  It  receives  much  less  attention  than 
Japan  in  United  States  newspapers  and  economic  journals, 
even  though  it  wields  as  least  as  much  influence  in  global  finan- 
cial affairs.  This  relative  discretion  reflects  Germany's  general 
reticence  about  projecting  itself  on  the  world  stage  in  eco- 
nomic matters  and  the  consistent  German  wish  to  integrate  its 
economy  into  the  EU. 

Germany  has  benefited  from  a  strikingly  benign  interna- 
tional economic  climate  for  the  past  half-century.  Despite  occa- 
sional crises — such  as  the  effects  of  the  United  States  decision 
to  end  the  dollar's  link  to  gold  in  1971  and  of  the  "oil  shocks" 
of  the  1970s  that  resulted  from  exporters'  sharp  increases  in 
the  price  of  petroleum — the  global  economic  scene  has  been 
remarkably  stable  in  comparison  with  that  of  the  1920s  and 
1930s.  This  stability  has  favored  the  kind  of  international  trad- 


307

ing  state  that  West  Germany  represented  and  that  united  Ger- 
many is  expected  to  become  once  unification  is  complete. 

Under  United  States  leadership,  the  Western  world  with 
free-market  economies  established  the  International  Monetary 
Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary)  and  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary) 
in  1944.  In  1947  these  nations  created  a  virtually  universal 
trade  structure,  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade 
(GATT — see  Glossary).  The  combination  of  open  financial  and 
trade  systems  has  helped  promote  continuous  and  even  dra- 
matic expansion  since  World  War  II  of  world  trade  and  the 
liquidity  of  international  capital.  Nothing  could  have  better 
suited  West  Germany  and  now  united  Germany. 

The  productive  capacities  of  both  East  Germany  and  West 
Germany  always  exceeded  the  absorptive  capacity  of  their 
respective  domestic  markets.  From  the  West  German  stand- 
point, this  characteristic  helped  to  fuel  the  German  export 
drive  and  to  generate  investment  capital.  It  also  strengthened 
the  deutsche  mark  and  helped  make  the  German  economy 
internationally  prominent. 

Although  Germany  has  a  global  currency  and  a  world-class 
trade  sector,  the  German  economy  remains  essentially  conti- 
nental in  focus.  Because  the  economy  lacks  the  size  necessary 
to  deal  with  the  effects  of  truly  massive  currency  flows,  Ger- 
many has  looked  for  partners  in  international  economic  mat- 
ters as  it  has  in  international  strategic  and  political  matters. 

The  German  government  and  the  Bundesbank,  Germany's 
central  bank,  are  active  participants  in  formal  and  informal 
international  institutions  and  arrangements  concerned  with 
global  finance  and  the  coordination  of  national  economic  poli- 
cies. West  Germany  was  a  founding  member  of  the  association 
of  free-market  economies  known  as  the  Group  of  Five  (G-5), 
which  later  became  the  Group  of  Seven  (G-7 — see  Glossary). 
But  the  German  government  has  also  had  to  acknowledge  that 
it  cannot  direct  the  policies  of  the  independent  Bundesbank, 
which  are  more  often  based  on  Germany's  domestic  needs 
than  on  the  wishes  of  the  outside  world. 

Germany  in  the  World  Economy 

Germany  in  World  Finance  and  in  the  Group  of  Seven 

Along  with  the  United  States  and  Japan,  Germany  has  one  of 
the  world's  biggest  economies  and  most  dominant  central 
banks.  Of  the  three,  Germany  has  the  smallest  and  most  vulner-

able  economy.  Germany's  GDP  of  DM3  trillion  (for  value  of  the 
deutsche  mark — see  Glossary)  is  less  than  one-third  of  United 
States  GDP  and  less  than  one-half  of  Japan's. 

Despite  Germany's  relatively  small  size,  it  has  consistently 
exerted  a  powerful  influence  on  the  world  economy.  Since  the 
end  of  World  War  II,  the  Federal  Republic  has  played  a  key  role 
in  beginning,  managing,  or  ending  each  crisis  and  each  phase 
experienced  by  the  global  monetary  system. 

The  first  phase  was  the  Bretton  Woods  era,  named  after  the 
New  Hampshire  resort  where  the  Allied  monetary  conference 
of  July  1944  created  the  IMF  and  shaped  the  global  postwar 
order.  The  dollar  was  pegged  to  gold  at  a  fixed  rate  of  US$35 
per  troy  ounce,  constituting  the  official  backing  of  the  global 
monetary  system;  other  currencies  were  linked  to  the  system 
through  their  own  fixed,  dollar-pegged  exchange  rates.  Coun- 
tries could  devalue  or  revalue  with  respect  to  the  dollar,  and 
the  dollar  price  of  gold  could  at  least  theoretically  remain  con- 
stant even  as  rates  of  exchange  between  separate  currencies 
fluctuated. 

By  the  late  1960s,  there  was  a  surplus  of  dollars  in  the  inter- 
national financial  system.  Largely  for  domestic  reasons,  the 
United  States  had  put  far  more  emphasis  on  expanding  dollar 
liquidity  than  on  maintaining  dollar  value.  Growing  fear  of 
United  States  inflation  had  made  those  dollars  less  desirable, 
and  many  central  banks  held  more  dollars  than  they  wanted. 
The  United  States  proposed  that  other  countries  revalue  their 
currencies  as  provided  under  the  Bretton  Woods  Agreement. 
But  those  other  countries,  and  West  Germany  in  particular, 
were  not  prepared  to  revalue.  Money  poured  into  purchases  of 
the  deutsche  mark,  sometimes  for  the  purchase  of  German 
goods,  but  more  often  to  hedge  against  the  dollar  or  to  make  a 
profit  when — as  was  widely  expected — the  deutsche  mark 
would  have  to  be  revalued.  West  German  foreign-exchange 
reserves  rose  from  US$2. V  billion  in  December  1969  to 
US$12.6  billion  by  December  1971,  and  to  US$28.1  billion  by 
September  1973.  The  steady  flow  of  foreign  money  into 
deutsche  marks  not  only  undercut  the  Bretton  Woods  system 
(see  Glossary)  but  also  threatened  to  import  inflation  into  Ger- 
many by  expanding  the  German  money  supply. 

West  Germany  tried  to  help  support  the  dollar  during  the 
late  1960s  and  early  1970s.  Bundesbank  president  Karl  Blessing 
sent  a  letter  to  the  chairman  of  the  United  States  Federal 
Reserve  Board  pledging  not  to  purchase  United  States  gold  but 


309 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

to  maintain  West  German  reserves  in  dollars.  West  German 
chancellor  Ludwig  Erhard  (1963-66)  agreed  to  make  large 
purchases  of  United  States  dollar  instruments  and  to  make 
"offset"  payments  to  lessen  demands  in  the  United  States  Con- 
gress for  a  reduction  in  United  States  forces  stationed  in  West 
Germany.  The  United  States  and  several  other  nations  pressed 
West  Germany  to  revalue  in  order  to  compensate  for  the  dollar 
glut.  Although  the  Bundesbank  would  have  favored  revaluation 
to  reduce  the  risk  of  inflation,  the  West  German  government 
was  afraid  that  a  revaluation  would  cut  into  West  Germany's 
global  competitiveness  and  curtail  exports. 

Finally,  after  intensifying  waves  of  speculation,  the  Bretton 
Woods  system  collapsed  in  August  1971.  The  United  States 
stopped  the  sale  of  gold  at  US$35  per  troy  ounce  and  thus 
removed  the  fixed  link  between  the  dollar  and  gold.  With  that 
step,  the  system  lost  its  anchor. 

The  deutsche  mark  remained  under  strain  throughout  the 
post-Bretton  Woods  period.  It  was  alternately  used  in  interven- 
tions to  support  the  dollar  or  as  a  hedge  against  it.  Other  cur- 
rencies again  flooded  into  purchases  of  deutsche  marks.  To 
ease  pressure  within  Europe,  West  Germany  and  other  Euro- 
pean states  agreed  to  peg  their  currencies  to  a  special  system  of 
relatively  narrow  exchange-rate  bands  formally  entitled  the 
"European  narrow-margins  agreement"  but  informally  known 
as  the  "snake."  But  the  snake  also  failed  to  hold.  The  domestic 
policies  and  even  the  economic  philosophies  of  its  leading 
member  states — West  Germany,  France,  Britain,  and  Italy — 
diverged  too  widely.  The  deutsche  mark  was  the  strongest  cur- 
rency, and  others  could  not  hold  their  value  against  it. 

The  United  States  and  West  Germany  played  key  roles  in  try- 
ing to  arrange  a  new  global  monetary  system.  But  they  had 
opposite  objectives:  the  United  States  was  determined  not  to 
have  the  dollar  reassume  responsibility  for  maintaining  an 
international  arrangement,  fearing  the  great  cost  to  its  exports 
and  economic  stability.  The  United  States  government  believed 
that  countries  with  a  trade  surplus,  such  as  West  Germany, 
should  accept  part  of  the  responsibility  for  solving  exchange- 
rate  crises  and  should  be  prepared  to  revalue,  and  it  insisted  on 
advance  agreement  for  sanctions  against  any  country  that 
refused  to  do  so.  Despite  its  readiness  to  make  minor 
exchange-rate  adjustments  for  the  sake  of  new  currency  align- 
ments, West  Germany  refused  to  commit  itself  to  any  arrange- 
ment that  would  oblige  it  to  revalue  in  the  future.

International  Economic  Relations 


In  March  1973,  the  United  States  and  other  governments 
and  central  banks  gave  up  trying  to  preserve  the  Bretton 
Woods  system  by  setting  new  fixed  exchange  rates.  With  that 
decision,  the  next  phase  of  the  postwar  international  system, 
"floating,"  began.  With  floating,  the  relationship  between  the 
United  States  dollar  and  the  deutsche  mark  became  subject  to 
market  forces  rather  than  official  negotiations.  West  Germany 
was  not  certain  whether  floating  would  serve  its  needs  but  was 
not  prepared  to  pursue  any  alternative. 

Floating  did  not  insulate  domestic  economies  from  interna- 
tional events  and  global  economic  forces.  Although  the  float- 
ing era  may  have  ended  the  period  of  fixed  links  to  the  dollar 
and  to  gold,  it  did  not  give  countries  complete  monetary  free- 
dom. It  only  meant  that  adjustments  would  be  made  by  the 
markets,  not  by  government  decree  or  agreement. Those 
adjustments  would,  at  least  theoretically,  occur  in  reaction  to 
trade  and  payments  imbalances,  correcting  them  over  time. 
However,  the  situation  did  not  work  out  as  expected  or 
planned.  The  increasingly  important  role  played  by  capital 
flows,  speculative  or  not,  undercut  the  theoretically  self-regu- 
lating mechanism  of  trade  flows  as  the  basis  of  currency  values. 

The  economic  consequences  of  floating  for  Germany  were 
not  uniformly  beneficial.  The  Bundesbank  welcomed  floating 
because  it  gave  the  bank  more  flexibility.  The  bank,  in  fact, 
could  virtually  control  the  deutsche  mark's  exchange  rate  if  it 
was  prepared  to  manipulate  interest  rates  to  that  end.  But  West 
German  industry,  and  especially  West  German  exporters,  did 
not  welcome  the  unpredictability  that  flexible  exchange  rates 
introduced  into  commercial  arrangements  and  production 
plans. 

West  German  exporters  also  faced  a  particular  problem  that 
persisted  in  the  1990s.  The  Bundesbank's  favorite  instrument 
for  fighting  inflation,  a  high  real  domestic  interest  rate,  is  also 
the  instrument  that  attracts  capital  to  the  deutsche  mark  and 
keeps  the  currency  valuable.  Many  businesspeople  feared  then, 
as  they  have  since,  that  the  Bundesbank's  anti-inflationary  pol- 
icy would  always  keep  the  deutsche  mark  stronger  than  most 
other  currencies  and  would  thus  jeopardize  exports. 

German  exchange-rate  policy  has  been  constantly  caught  on 
the  horns  of  that  dilemma.  When  a  decision  absolutely  needed 
to  be  made  during  the  floating  era,  however,  German  govern- 
ments and  the  Bundesbank  have  almost  always  chosen  an  anti- 
inflationary  course  of  action.  They  have  preferred  a  strong  cur- 


311 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

rency,  which  might  adversely  affect  trade,  to  a  weak  one,  which 
would  jeopardize  the  stability  of  the  German  monetary  system. 
With  that  choice,  they  set  policy  for  others  as  well  as  for  them- 
selves. As  long  as  the  deutsche  mark  is  strong  and  German 
interest  rates  remain  high,  even  the  United  States  can  diverge 
from  German  policy  only  at  the  risk  of  seeing  its  own  currency 
fall  in  value.  Because  of  Germany's  monetary  dilemma,  and 
because  the  German  government  as  well  as  the  nation's  bank- 
ers and  industrialists  have  recognized  German  limitations  and 
vulnerabilities,  all  have  been  anxious  to  establish  the  highest 
possible  level  of  international  predictability.  The  Germans  have 
become  regular  participants  in  international  economic  consul- 
tations, and  they  have  emphasized  the  value  of  such  consulta- 
tions at  every  opportunity. 

Global  economic  coordination  after  the  end  of  the  Bretton 
Woods  system  has  resulted  in  the  development  of  a  number  of 
coordinating  institutions.  One,  first  known  informally  as  the 
Group  of  Five  (G-5),  consisted  of  the  United  States,  West  Ger- 
many, Japan,  Britain,  and  France.  After  Canada  and  Italy 
joined,  the  association  became  known  as  the  Group  of  Seven 
(G-7).  The  G-7  includes  the  finance  ministers  and  central 
bankers  of  the  principal  economic  powers,  who  meet  periodi- 
cally and  consult  regularly  between  meetings. 

In  addition  to  the  meeting  of  G-7  finance  ministers,  there  is 
an  annual  G— 7  economic  summit  at  which  the  heads  of  state  or 
government  of  the  same  seven  countries  meet  to  coordinate 
economic  and  political  policies  or  at  least  to  attempt  to  under- 
stand each  other  better.  The  summits  have  been  held  annually 
since  1975  on  a  rotating  basis  among  the  summit  states,  usually 
in  the  capital.  At  the  Naples  summit  of  the  G-7  in  1994,  Russia 
joined  the  political  discussions,  essentially  turning  the  gather- 
ing into  the  Group  of  Eight  (G-8). 

Three  summits,  those  of  1978,  1985,  and  1992,  took  place  in 
Germany.  Each  was  significant  for  different  reasons.  In  1978 
Chancellor  Helmut  Schmidt  (1974-82)  committed  West  Ger- 
many to  a  more  reflationary  policy,  to  his  later  regret.  Seven 
years  later,  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl  (1982-  )  and  other  sum- 
mit principals  made  commitments  toward  supply-side  policies 
that  most  participants  agreed  were  then  necessary  and  that 
both  Kohl  and  United  States  president  Ronald  Reagan  wanted 
to  use  to  reduce  the  role  of  government  in  their  national  econ- 
omies. Seven  years  later,  at  Munich  in  1992,  the  G-7  agreed  to 
provide  aid  to  Russia.  However,  the  summit  did  not  reach 


312 


International  Economic  Relations 


agreement  on  the  Uruguay  Round  of  the  GATT  negotiations, 
and  Chancellor  Kohl  did  not  carry  out  what  the  United  States 
had  regarded  as  his  promise  to  persuade  the  French  to  reduce 
their  insistence  on  large  EC  agricultural  export  subsidies. 

German  bankers  and  financial  officials  have  usually  spoken 
skeptically  about  possible  results  from  the  summits,  making 
abundantly  clear  that  the  meetings  do  not  affect  their  views, 
although  they  may  subsequently  adjust  specific  policies. 
Bundesbank  president  Hans  Tietmeyer  has  stated  that  West 
Germany  sees  them  as  occasions  for  "cooperation,"  not  "coor- 
dination." German  global  policy  has  thus  been  guided  by  broad 
efforts  to  coordinate  specific  policies,  but  with  a  firm  wish  to 
preserve  German  interests  and  its  friendships  with  the  EU 
members  it  considers  its  principal  economic  partners. 

The  Deutsche  Mark  as  an  International  Currency 

At  the  core  of  Germany's  success  and  influence  lies  its  cur- 
rency. The  deutsche  mark  gave  concrete  expression  to  West 
Germany's  international  financial  and  economic  success  and 
also  contributed  to  it.  Since  unification,  it  has  become  even 
more  important  as  a  symbol  as  well  as  an  instrument  of  Ger- 
many's new  central  role  in  Europe.  The  success  of  the  deutsche 
mark  has  been  anchored  in  the  success  of  West  German 
exports,  in  the  Bundesbank's  solicitous  management  of  the 
currency's  value,  and  in  the  confidence  generated  by  the  coun- 
try's prosperity. 

The  deutsche  mark  has  been  a  model  of  stability  since  it 
became  fully  convertible  in  1958.  No  other  major  currency, 
including  the  Japanese  yen  or  the  Swiss  franc,  has  been  stron- 
ger. The  United  States  dollar,  the  cornerstone  of  the  global  sys- 
tem, has  lost  about  two-thirds  of  its  value  against  the  deutsche 
mark  since  1958. 

The  deutsche  mark  has  become  the  second-largest  currency 
component  of  global  monetary  reserves,  second  only  to  the 
United  States  dollar.  Less  than  10  percent  of  the  world's  mone- 
tary reserves  were  held  in  deutsche  marks  throughout  most  of 
the  1970s,  but  the  amount  rose  to  15  percent  by  the  end  of 
1987.  By  the  end  of  1989,  around  20  percent  of  all  global  mon- 
etary reserves  were  in  deutsche  marks.  The  deutsche  mark's 
position  in  global  monetary  reserves  largely  reflects  the  exten- 
sive deutsche  mark  holdings  in  European  foreign-exchange 
reserve  accounts  as  well  as  the  desire  among  all  industrial  state 
treasuries  and  central  banks  to  hold  a  stable  currency  in  their 


313 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

reserves.  According  to  the  United  States  Federal  Reserve 
Board,  the  United  States  government  holds  more  than  US$13 
billion  of  its  reserves  in  deutsche  marks,  an  amount  greater 
than  its  holdings  in  Japanese  yen. 

The  deutsche  mark  is  not  used  as  widely  for  transactions  as  it 
is  to  supply  central-bank  reserves.  Global  commodity  prices  are 
still  largely  denominated  in  United  States  dollars.  Whatever  the 
deutsche  mark's  strengths  may  be,  it  does  not  offer  the  kind  of 
liquidity  that  the  dollar  does.  Invoicing  in  deutsche  marks  is 
concentrated  on  Germany's  own  commerce,  but  almost  15  per- 
cent of  world  trade  is  conducted  on  a  deutsche  mark  basis.  The 
deutsche  mark  figures  much  less  significantly  than  the  dollar  in 
the  creation  of  international  credits  or  in  debt  servicing.  But  a 
growing  quantity  of  international  bond  issues — including  some 
being  floated  in  the  United  States — are  denominated  in  deut- 
sche marks.  Major  United  States  banks  offer  deutsche  mark 
accounts  for  Americans  who  want  to  hedge  some  of  their  assets 
against  a  fall  in  the  dollar.  The  World  Bank  has  floated  Euro- 
deutsche  mark  bonds,  as  have  various  United  States  corpora- 
tions. In  Europe  the  deutsche  mark  has  virtually  become  a 
parallel  currency,  with  prices  in  Western  Europe  and  Eastern 
Europe  increasingly  quoted  in  deutsche  marks  as  well  as  in 
local  currencies. 

Bundesbank  officials  worry  constantly  that  the  growing  cir- 
culation of  the  deutsche  mark  makes  it  difficult  to  control  the 
supply  of  the  central  bank's  own  currency.  Deutsche  marks 
held  abroad,  circulating  abroad,  and  perhaps  even  used  for 
currency  intervention  abroad  are  still  part  of  the  total  German 
money  supply.  Sudden,  large  flows  could  have  undesirable 
impacts  on  German  interest  rates  or  German  prices,  materially 
complicating  the  execution  of  German  monetary  policy.  The 
bank  fears  that  any  decline  in  the  deutsche  mark's  value  or  in 
the  German  current-account  surplus  could  set  off  a  selling 
wave  that  would  force  it  to  intervene  massively  and  perhaps 
unsuccessfully.  Bundesbank  president  Tietmeyer  has  warned 
that  the  high  deutsche  mark  holdings  abroad  place  a  particular 
burden  on  the  Bundesbank  because  any  loss  of  faith  in  the  Ger- 
man currency  could  provoke  large-scale  selling.  The  deutsche 
mark  has  thus  become  a  burden  for  Germany  as  well  as  a  bless- 
ing. The  Bundesbank  stated  in  May  1991  that  one  reason  it  had 
to  maintain  high  interest  rates  was  to  avoid  the  kind  of  decline 
and  subsequent  market  effects  that  Tietmeyer  had  cited.  The 
German  currency  risks  finding  itself  on  a  treadmill  where  the

medieval  square,  the  Romerplatz,  and  a  skyline  of  skyscrapers, 

headquarters  of  large  banks.

stronger  it  gets,  the  stronger  it  must  remain  until  the  German 
monetary  authorities  no  longer  dare  to  reduce  interest  rates 
significantly  for  fear  that  they  might  spark  a  deutsche  mark  sell- 
off. 

The  IMF  recognized  the  reality  of  German  monetary  power 
in  1990,  when  it  promoted  Germany  and  Japan  to  share  the 
second  rank  just  below  the  United  States  and  ahead  of  Britain 
and  France.  German  government  and  banking  officials  were 
not  certain  that  they  welcomed  such  prominence,  but  they 
were  prepared  to  accept  it  as  a  reflection  of  international 
appreciation  of  German  monetary  policies. 

The  West  German  role  in  the  development  of  the  global 
financial  and  monetary  system  has  been  replete  with  ironies. 
No  state  consistently  had  a  greater  interest  in  developing  a  sta- 


315 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

ble  system  and  in  cooperating  in  such  a  system.  Nonetheless, 
West  German  policy  helped  undermine  and  even  destroy  some 
of  the  arrangements  that  West  Germany  wanted  to  maintain. 
During  the  Bretton  Woods  era,  pressures  on  the  dollar  almost 
always  expressed  themselves  in  massive  purchases  of  deutsche 
marks.  The  strength  of  the  deutsche  mark  weakened  the  sys- 
tem because  any  currency — including  the  United  States  dol- 
lar— could  come  under  attack  if  it  were  not  defended  and 
preserved  as  solicitously  as  the  deutsche  mark  was  by  Germany. 
The  only  currencies  and  systems  that  survived  this  pressure 
were  those  whose  governments  determined  from  the  begin- 
ning that  they  would  follow  a  strict  monetary  discipline  similar 
to  that  applied  by  the  Bundesbank  to  the  deutsche  mark. 

Germany  in  the  European  Economy 

Germany  in  the  European  Community 

If  Germany's  global  role  is  beset  with  complications,  its  Euro- 
pean role  seems  relatively  clear.  Germany  has  always  concen- 
trated its  economic  interests  and  activities,  whether  in  trade, 
investment,  or  finance,  within  whatever  form  was  being  taken 
by  West  European  integration. 

Although  German  economic  and  political  interests  cover  all 
of  Europe,  they  have  been  most  immediately  reflected  in  the 
EU  and  the  European  Monetary  System  (EMS).  The  Germans 
have  found  that  these  two  systems  complement  each  other.  But 
the  German  government  and  German  business  and  banking 
establishments  have  long  had  separate  attitudes  toward  the  two 
institutions,  and  they  play  a  different  role  in  each. 

The  EC  was  West  Germany's  economic  home,  and  the  coun- 
try remains  one  of  the  organization's  strongest  supporters. 
Chancellor  Kohl  on  several  occasions  made  special  efforts  to 
promote  European  cooperation,  especially  concentrating  on 
the  drive  to  create  a  European  Single  Market  and  on  the  nego- 
tiation and  ratification  of  the  Treaty  on  European  Union  (com- 
monly known  as  the  Maastricht  Treaty — see  Glossary)  (see  The 
European  Single  Market,  this  ch.).  Kohl  also  intervened  on 
occasion  to  avert  potential  conflicts  between  Germany's  Euro- 
pean interests  and  its  ties  with  the  United  States,  although  he 
had  great  difficulty  resolving  the  dispute  over  agricultural  trade 
that  broke  out  between  the  United  States  and  France  during 
negotiation  of  the  Uruguay  Round  of  the  GATT  talks.  He  also 


316 


International  Economic  Relations 


followed  up  German  unification  with  efforts  to  draw  the  EU 
further  toward  Eastern  Europe. 

Germans  have  consistently  pressed  for  closer  integration  of 
the  states  of  Western  Europe,  officially  and  in  public  opinion. 
They  have  also  been  among  the  staunchest  European  advo- 
cates of  open  trade  between  Europe  and  the  outside  world. 
German  officials  and  political  leaders  have  strongly  and  consis- 
tently asserted  that  United  States  fears  about  a  "Fortress 
Europe"  are  misplaced.  Whereas  several  other  European 
states — especially  France  and  Italy — have  tried  to  limit  imports 
of  various  foreign  products  to  the  EU,  the  German  government 
has  argued  for  open  markets,  imposing  fewer  controls  or 
restrictions  on  trade  than  most  European  states. 

West  Germany,  and  especially  West  German  industry,  carved 
out  an  important  export  niche  within  the  EC.  In  the  process,  it 
made  the  EC  an  essential  market  for  German  goods  and  an 
important  factor  in  German  prosperity.  Because  one-third  of 
West  German  GDP  was  exported  and  because  one-half  of  all 
exports  went  to  countries  of  the  EC,  at  least  one  of  every  six 
West  German  jobs  depended  directly  on  the  EC  market.  Many 
other  jobs  depended  on  imports  from  EC  states  or  on  the  gen- 
eral prosperity  the  EC  had  brought  to  all  its  members. 

The  intimate  connection  with  the  EC  was  reflected  in  West 
German  trade  statistics  (see  table  19,  Appendix).  Not  only  did 
more  than  half  of  West  German  exports  go  to  other  EC  coun- 
tries, but  many  West  German  industries  relied  on  the  EC  for  a 
major  share  of  their  total  market — whether  domestic  or  inter- 
national. Before  unification  in  1990,  48  percent  of  West  Ger- 
many's production  of  office  machinery  was  exported  to  other 
EC  countries,  as  was  24  percent  of  its  chemical  goods  and 
machinery,  23  percent  of  its  motor  vehicles,  17  percent  of  its 
electronic  goods,  16  percent  of  its  textiles,  and  14  percent  of  its 
iron  and  steel. 

But  if  West  European  trade  was  vital  to  West  Germany  and 
remains  so  for  united  Germany,  West  Germany  was  vital  to  the 
success  of  the  EC.  Even  before  German  unification,  there  were 
more  Germans — more  than  60  million — than  any  other 
nationality  in  the  EC.  With  unification  the  figure  came  to 
about  80  million.  West  Germany  alone  already  had  the  largest 
share  of  the  EC's  GDP,  over  25  percent;  the  largest  amount  of 
private  consumption,  more  than  DM1.2  trillion  in  1988;  and 
the  largest  investment  in  other  EC  countries,  DM56.7  billion. 
Because  the  German  share  of  EC  production  and  consumption 


317 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

was  expected  to  grow  in  the  aftermath  of  unification,  the  EC 
recognized  the  impact  of  this  process  by  allotting  united  Ger- 
many a  larger  number  of  seats — ninety-nine — in  the  European 
Parliament  than  any  other  state. 

The  Federal  Republic  was  often  termed  the  EC's  "paymas- 
ter." Its  net  contribution  to  the  EC  budget  was  often  four  times 
as  large  as  the  next-largest  contribution  because  West  Germany 
never  drew  as  heavily  as  such  states  as  France  or  the  poorer 
Mediterranean  countries  on  either  the  agricultural  or  the 
developmental  support  programs.  West  Germany  regularly  pro- 
vided over  25  percent  of  the  EC  budget,  with  no  other  state 
contributing  more  than  20  percent;  and  united  Germany's  pro- 
jected share  of  the  1994  EU  budget  was  30  percent,  or  DM44.1 
billion.  Although  Germany  was  receiving  some  EU  aid  in  1994 
to  develop  the  economy  of  the  former  East  Germany,  united 
Germany  will  in  the  future  be  expected  to  contribute  an  even 
larger  share  to  the  EU  than  West  Germany  did — in  part 
because  Germany  itself  is  larger  and  in  part  because  many  pro- 
spective East  European  members  will  need  support.  This  was 
one  reason  Germany  strongly  supported  the  EU  membership 
applications  of  such  relatively  well-to-do  states  as  Norway,  Swe- 
den, Finland,  and  Austria.  Germany's  contribution  to  the  EU  is 
becoming  increasingly  controversial,  however,  as  more  and 
more  Germans  complain  about  the  growth  of  the  EU  budget. 
Several  German  political  figures,  including  Bavaria's  political 
leader,  Minister  President  Edmund  Stoiber,  have  said  that  Ger- 
many must  reduce  its  contribution. 

Because  of  the  multifaceted  economic  relationships  between 
Germany  and  other  EU  countries,  different  ministries  in  Bonn 
can  have  different  and  even  conflicting  interests  and  policies 
concerning  various  items  on  the  European  agenda.  Many  min- 
istries have  their  own  direct  links  to  the  EU  bureaucracy  in 
Brussels,  and  the  German  government  has  occasionally  spoken 
with  several  voices  at  different  levels  until  the  problems  were 
brought  to  the  attention  of  senior  officials  in  Bonn  and  priori- 
ties were  established.  By  the  same  token,  German  ministries 
have  at  times  used  elements  within  the  European  bureaucracy 
to  support  their  views  at  home.  It  has  been  left  to  the  three 
ministries  with  the  broadest  responsibilities — the  Ministry  for 
Economics,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the  Ministry  of  For- 
eign Affairs — to  try  to  keep  these  separate  issues  in  a  total 
national-interest  perspective.  Those  ministries  have  also  had  to 
block  collusion  between  European  and  German  bureaucracies

to  devise  new  subsidies  and  new  ways  to  protect  or  subsidize 
special  German  or  European  interests. 

Management  of  the  EU's  Common  Agricultural  Policy 
(CAP — see  Glossary)  illustrates  some  of  the  conflicts  in  intra- 
German  interests.  That  system,  by  its  commitment  to  subsidize 
both  production  and  exports,  has  become  increasingly  expen- 
sive. It  consumes  more  than  half  of  the  EU  budget,  or  more 
than  US$35  billion  a  year.  Germany's  Ministry  of  Agriculture 
has  often  tried  to  use  the  EU  to  drive  support  prices  higher  and 
to  prevent  or  restrict  foreign  imports.  The  Ministry  of  Finance, 
by  constrast,  has  sought  to  reduce  the  CAP  in  order  to  cut  the 
German  contribution  to  the  EU. 

The  European  Single  Market 

To  advance  the  EC  toward  a  truly  integrated  and  borderless 
internal  market — the  European  Single  Market — the  EC's  Euro- 
pean Commission  (see  Glossary)  in  1985  submitted  a  white 
paper  to  the  European  Council  (see  Glossary)  in  which  it  listed 
a  series  of  225  steps  needed  to  create  such  a  market.  It  also  pro- 
posed a  schedule  for  completing  these  steps  in  time  for  the 
internal  market  to  begin  functioning  by  the  end  of  1992.  The 
council  accepted  the  commission's  proposals,  with  West  Ger- 
many strongly  supporting  the  concept.  West  Germany  later 
advanced  the  process  significantly  during  its  presidency  of  the 
council  in  the  second  half  of  1988. 

Once  Germany  was  united,  it  remained  among  the  Euro- 
pean states  the  most  determined  to  implement  the  conditions 
of  the  European  Single  Market.  Even  before  the  formal  imple- 
mentation of  the  single  market  on  January  1,  1993,  Germany 
had  already  incorporated  80  percent  of  the  single-market  regu- 
lations into  its  own  legislation,  a  higher  percentage  than  any 
European  state  except  Denmark  or  France.  Notably,  the  Ger- 
man government  also  applied  those  new  regulations  in  the  five 
new  states  {Lander,  sing.,  Land)  of  the  former  East  Germany,  as 
well  as  in  the  old  Lander  of  western  Germany. 

Not  all  Germans  welcomed  the  coming  of  an  open  internal 
market.  Many  worried  that  the  guidelines  for  such  a  market 
would  give  so  much  power  to  the  bureaucrats  within  the  Euro- 
pean Commission  that  economic  initiative  within  the  member 
states  might  be  stifled.  Many  German  businesspeople  dreaded 
the  prospect  of  more  EU  offices  in  Brussels  enforcing  more 
regulations.  Some  Lander,  especially  Bavaria,  as  well  as  a  num- 
ber of  German  communities,  became  disturbed  by  prospects 


319 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 


that  the  EU  would  in  the  future  have  such  immense  powers 
over  economic  life  that  the  German  federal  system  itself  could 
be  placed  in  jeopardy.  As  a  result,  Germans  have  become 
strong  advocates  of  the  principle  of  Subsidaritat  (subsidiarity), 
under  which  matters  not  specifically  covered  by  EU  laws  are  left 
to  the  practices  and  the  laws  of  the  individual  national  states. 

Despite  steady  German  government  support  for  the  internal 
market,  attitudes  in  German  business  and  economic  circles 
also  have  remained  mixed,  depending  on  the  size  and  interests 
of  the  affected  firms.  The  largest  German  firms  with  strong 
export  positions  strongly  favor  the  internal  market.  The  mid- 
sized firms,  which  are  unable  to  relocate  their  main  production 
sites  or  develop  subsidiary  sites  abroad,  have  a  more  cautious 
reaction.  Smaller  firms,  especially  those  involved  in  handicrafts 
or  services,  are  fearful  of  the  competition  that  might  come 
from  other  European  countries  with  lower  production  costs. 

Just  as  firms  of  different  sizes  have  reacted  differently  to  the 
internal  market,  so  have  firms  in  different  industries.  The  pro- 
ducers of  Germany's  most  competitive  products — whether 
automotive  manufacturers,  toolmakers,  chemical  firms,  or  elec- 
tronics firms — regard  the  single  market  as  an  opportunity.  By 
constrast,  Germany's  relatively  inefficient  service  firms, 
whether  in  telecommunications,  banking,  or  insurance,  see  the 
market  as  a  threat  because  it  would  eliminate  national  regula- 
tions that  had  given  them  privileged  positions. 

German  trade  unions  particularly  fear  the  internal  market. 
They  have  warned  that  it  will  cause  production  to  move  to 
countries  and  regions  where  wages  are  lowest  and  social  bene- 
fits most  limited.  Despite  the  existence  of  strict  EU  standards 
governing  the  rights  and  privileges  of  workers,  the  trade 
unions  have  consistently  warned  of  "social  dumping,"  the  temp- 
tation for  manufacturers  to  look  for  those  sites  where  regula- 
tions are  less  stringent  or  are  less  vigorously  enforced  than  in 
Germany. 

German  environmentalists,  for  their  part,  fear  that  German 
manufacturers  might  shade  their  environmental  commitments 
in  order  to  keep  their  costs  as  low  as  possible  against  competi- 
tors who  face  fewer  environmental  problems  in  less  densely  set- 
tled countries  (see  The  Environment,  ch.  3).  Environmentalists 
have  also  expressed  concern  that  manufacturers  will  be 
tempted  to  locate  production  facilities  abroad,  where  environ- 
mental standards  might  be  less  rigorously  enforced  or  where 
less  severe  population  and  land-use  pressures  might  make  pol- 


320 


International  Economic  Relations 


lution  seem  less  onerous.  As  German  trade  unions  fear  social 
dumping,  the  environmental  groups  fear  "environmental 
dumping." 

With  the  continued  development  of  the  internal  European 
market,  many  Germans  began  to  perceive  another  danger — 
that  the  EU  might  become  so  internally  focused  that  it  could 
become  too  protectionist.  The  Board  of  Advisers  to  the  Ger- 
man Ministry  for  Economics  warned  in  1990  that  such  protec- 
tionist thinking,  if  not  promptly  countered,  could  jeopardize 
European  prosperity.  German  industry  and  trade  associations 
have  expressed  similar  concerns,  warning  that  the  protectionist 
risk  of  the  internal  market  must  be  fought  at  every  level  to 
avoid  driving  Germany  ever  more  into  a  limited  European 
mold.  German  industry  has  consistently  pointed  out  that  Ger- 
many stands  to  lose  far  more  than  any  other  European  state  if 
the  global  trading  system  collapses  because  of  the  protectionist 
proclivities  of  the  EU. 

The  increasing  power  of  protectionist  forces  in  the  EU  has 
raised  concerns  in  Germany  about  the  potential  for  the  emer- 
gence of  three  separate  and  competitive  regional  trading  areas, 
the  EU,  the  Americas,  and  Asia,  with  some  form  of  negoti- 
ated— or  managed — trade  among  them.  Any  such  arrange- 
ment negotiated  by  the  EU  would  establish  quotas  for  each 
side,  and  Germany  almost  certainly  would  not  obtain  as  large  a 
share  of  any  European  quota  as  that  which  German  exporters 
could  obtain  on  their  own. 

Regardless  of  its  concerns  about  protectionism,  the  German 
government  has  continued  to  insist  that  it  will  fulfill  its  commit- 
ment to  complete  European  integration  and  the  single  market. 
Political  considerations,  especially  Germany's  relationship  with 
France,  have  helped  to  shape  and  support  that  policy  as  much 
as  economic  considerations  have.  But  the  Germans  have 
noticed  with  concern  that  France  is  often  the  state  that  tries  to 
make  the  EU  more  protectionist.  The  Germans  believe  that 
they  cannot  support  such  French  efforts,  even  if  they  cannot 
block  them.  German  minister  of  foreign  affairs  Klaus  Kinkel 
has  warned  that  Germany  does  not  agree  with  all  French  views 
on  international  trade  rules,  but  Chancellor  Kohl  remains 
reluctant  to  press  France  toward  a  more  open  global  trading 
system. 

Kohl,  in  fact,  has  sought  to  use  EU  cooperation  to  help 
cement  a  close  German  relationship  with  France.  He  and 
French  president  Francois  Mitterrand  promised  in  early  1994 


321 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

that  they  would  use  the  successive  German  and  French  presi- 
dencies of  the  European  Council  during  the  last  half  of  1994 
and  the  first  half  of  1995  to  plan  and  execute  a  joint  program 
for  the  further  development  of  the  EU. 

Germany  and  the  European  Union 

Kohl  believed  that  it  was  important  for  a  united  Germany  to 
have  a  firm  anchor  in  the  West,  especially  in  a  structure  for 
West  European  and,  later,  European,  integration  (see  Euro- 
pean Union,  ch.  8).  He  therefore  played  a  major  part  in  gain- 
ing Europe-wide  approval  of  the  Maastricht  Treaty  negotiated 
at  the  European  Council  summit  in  December  1991.  He 
refused  to  be  deterred  after  a  first  Danish  referendum  rejected 
the  treaty,  insisting  that  Germany  proceed  to  ratification.  The 
two  houses  of  parliament,  the  Bundestag  and  Bundesrat,  vindi- 
cated Kohl's  position,  approving  the  Maastricht  Treaty  by  over- 
whelming majorities  despite  reservations  in  some  Lander  that  it 
might  undermine  the  German  federal  system  by  giving  the  EC 
and  its  European  Commission  greater  powers  over  the  separate 
Lander  than  even  the  Bonn  government  possessed. 

Germany  also  strongly  supported  the  creation  of  the  Euro- 
pean Economic  Area  (EEA — see  Glossary),  established  in  1993 
to  create  a  trade  area  consisting  of  the  EC  and  most  of  the 
states  of  the  European  Free  Trade  Association  (EFTA — see 
Glossary).  It  later  advocated  the  entry  of  four  EFTA  mem- 
bers— Norway,  Sweden,  Finland,  and  Austria — into  the  EU.  By 
the  same  token,  Germany  has  favored  developing  close  links 
between  the  EU  and  the  East  European  states,  although  Ger- 
man farmers  and  steel  manufacturers  have  joined  other  EU 
producers  in  seeking  to  block  those  East  European  imports 
that  would  be  most  competitive  with  their  own  output. 

During  the  entire  process  of  creating  a  more  integrated 
Europe,  Kohl  and  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Kinkel  continu- 
ously stressed  the  German  commitment  to  integration.  Kohl 
has  told  the  Bundestag  that  Germany's  national  future  lies  in 
Europe,  and  he  has  used  every  possible  opportunity  to  point 
out  that  Germany's  firmly  anchored  position  within  Europe  has 
been  mainly  responsible  for  giving  Germany  peace,  prosperity, 
and  its  chance  at  unification. 

Germany  in  the  European  Monetary  System 

West  Germany  helped  to  start  the  European  Monetary  Sys- 
tem (EMS)  in  the  late  1970s  and  has  long  provided  the  anchor 


322 


International  Economic  Relations 


of  its  principal  operating  element,  the  European  exchange-rate 
mechanism  (ERM — see  Glossary).  It  has  exercised  consider- 
able and  sometimes  even  dominant  influence  on  the  evolution 
of  European  monetary  affairs.  Nonetheless,  the  EMS  was  much 
more  difficult  for  West  Germany  to  propose  or  even  to  accept 
than  the  EC.  Although  much  of  West  German  business  and 
government  felt  very  much  at  home  in  the  EC  from  the  begin- 
ning, Germany  had  reasons  to  be  much  more  anxious  about 
monetary  cooperation. 

The  concepts  of  the  EMS  and  the  EU  are  very  different, 
although  they  may  be  complementary,  and  they  look  especially 
different  to  Germans.  A  common  trading  area  within  Europe 
helps  Germany  to  do  what  it  does  best:  produce  and  export. 
Although  Germans  have  had  to  open  their  own  borders  to  oth- 
ers, they  have  always  been  confident  about  meeting  such  a  chal- 
lenge. 

Money,  however,  is  something  else  again,  especially  in  Ger- 
many. West  Germany's  strict  monetary  policy  was  seen  by  many 
West  Germans  as  the  guarantor  of  the  Federal  Republic's  stabil- 
ity and  prestige.  Any  West  German  political  or  economic 
debate  assumed  the  solidity  of  the  deutsche  mark.  European 
monetary  cooperation  could  only  be  acceptable  in  West  Ger- 
many if  it  jeopardized  neither  the  deutsche  mark  nor  the  pol- 
icy that  had  given  the  currency  its  success  and  had  given  West 
Germany  its  prosperity  and  domestic  tranquillity. 

Many  West  Germans  feared  that  European  monetary  coop- 
eration would  have  a  pernicious  effect  on  West  Germany's  own 
money  by  posing  a  risk  to  the  independence  and  integrity  of 
West  German  financial  and  monetary  policies.  They  believed, 
and  not  without  reason,  that  many  other  states  in  Europe  did 
not  share  West  Germany's  belief  in  monetary  stability  as  the 
principal  objective  of  financial  policy.  They  looked  with  partic- 
ular suspicion  at  Britain,  Italy,  and  the  smaller  countries  of 
southern  Europe. 

The  West  German  government  and  the  Bundesbank  tried, 
therefore,  to  ensure  that  no  European  monetary  arrangement 
would  interfere  with  West  Germany's  freedom  to  choose  its 
monetary  objectives  and  policies.  They  consistently  tried  to 
construct  arrangements  that  would  give  them  a  dominant 
influence  over  European  policy  or,  if  that  was  impossible, 
would  at  least  enable  them  to  continue  pursuing  their  tradi- 
tional goals.  The  West  German  government  and  the  Bundes- 
bank did  not  always  agree  about  what  constituted  satisfactory

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

arrangements,  however,  with  the  bank  usually  being  more  cau- 
tious than  the  government.  Nonetheless,  West  Germany 
helped  to  establish  the  system  of  European  monetary  coopera- 
tion and  was  among  its  main  beneficiaries. 

A  number  of  proposals  for  European  monetary  cooperation 
were  advanced  and  discussed  as  the  European  Coal  and  Steel 
Community  (ECSC)  came  into  being  in  1951,  as  other  plans 
for  West  European  cooperation  were  considered,  and  as  the 
Bretton  Woods  system  began  to  crumble  in  the  1960s.  None 
came  to  fruition,  but  they  provided  some  of  the  intellectual 
foundations  for  later  efforts.  It  was  only  in  1972,  after  the  col- 
lapse of  the  Bretton  Woods  system,  that  the  first  arrangement 
for  true  European  coordination  was  put  into  place — the  Euro- 
pean narrow-margins  agreement,  which  came  to  be  known  as 
the  "snake"  (see  Germany  in  World  Finance  and  in  the  Group 
of  Seven,  this  ch.).  West  Germany  helped  to  establish  the  sys- 
tem, a  joint  European  float  whose  purpose  was  to  ensure  that 
European  currencies  would  not  fluctuate  more  against  each 
other  than  against  the  United  States  dollar. 

The  deutsche  mark  became  the  strongest  currency  in  the 
snake.  It  remained  at  the  top  of  the  snake's  trading  range,  in 
part  because  of  West  Germany's  export  surplus  but  especially 
because  West  German  domestic  monetary  policy  inspired  con- 
fidence that  the  deutsche  mark's  value  would  be  protected  and 
might  even  rise  against  other  currencies.  Others  soon  learned 
that  staying  in  the  snake  meant  a  commitment  to  emulate  the 
policies  of  the  Bundesbank  or  to  suffer  the  exchange-rate  con- 
sequences of  any  divergence.  Because  most  countries  could  not 
do  this,  the  snake  had  to  be  abandoned  as  a  major  interna- 
tional currency  arrangement.  But  a  truncated  snake  did  sur- 
vive, in  part  because  some  smaller  countries  were  prepared  and 
to  some  extent  were  obliged  to  follow  the  West  German  lead, 
and  in  part  because,  despite  its  imperfections,  it  offered  a 
modicum  of  stability. 

As  the  1970s  drew  to  a  close,  there  were  debates  about  mon- 
etary policy  in  almost  every  European  country.  Whatever  the 
imperfections  of  the  snake,  it  was  clear  to  many  states  that  any 
port  in  a  storm  might  be  better  than  none.  The  oil  shocks  con- 
fronted Western  states  with  pressures  that  paradoxically  could 
be  both  recessionary  and  inflationary.  Some  countries,  such  as 
the  United  States,  chose  to  counteract  the  recessionary  pres- 
sures. Others,  such  as  West  Germany,  chose  to  counteract  the 
inflationary  threats.  Most  European  countries  increasingly 


326 


International  Economic  Relations 


found  the  West  German  approach  more  congenial  than  that  of 
the  United  States. 

The  main  debate  in  West  Germany,  as  in  several  other  large 
European  countries,  was  between  those  who  came  to  be  known 
as  the  "monetarists"  and  those  who  came  to  be  known  as  the 
"economists."  The  monetarists  believed  that  introducing  fixed 
exchange  rates  would  force  countries  to  pursue  similar  eco- 
nomic policies  and  that  this  would  make  interventions  less  nec- 
essary, and  perhaps  even  unnecessary.  The  economists  argued 
that  common  economic  policies  had  to  precede  fixed 
exchange  rates  because  the  exchange-rate  system  would  break 
down  otherwise.  They  thought  that  a  common  currency  should 
cap  a  structure  of  common  policy,  not  help  to  build  it. 

Most  West  German  economists  as  well  as  government  and 
Bundesbank  officials  belonged  solidly  in  the  economist  camp. 
They  did  not  want  to  join  in  any  European  monetary  collabora- 
tion until  European  states  had  shown  that  they  would  coordi- 
nate economic  policies.  The  experience  with  the  snake,  and 
the  costly  and  frequent  interventions  that  it  had  required 
before  it  finally  broke  down,  only  hardened  their  attitudes. 

It  was  against  this  background  of  deep  skepticism  that  Chan- 
cellor Helmut  Schmidt  decided  in  1978  and  1979  to  cooperate 
with  French  president  Valery  Giscard  d'Estaing  in  creating  the 
EMS.  Because  of  opposition  from  the  Bundesbank  and  the 
Ministry  for  Economics,  Schmidt  conducted  the  crucial  initial 
phase  of  the  negotiations  in  great  secrecy,  keeping  them  secret 
from  the  German  bureaucracy  and  the  Bundesbank. 

The  EMS  established  not  only  a  zone  of  monetary  coopera- 
tion but  also  a  European  currency  known  as  the  European  cur- 
rency unit  (ECU — see  Glossary).  It  was  designated  to  represent 
a  basket  of  currencies  from  the  EMS  countries,  to  be  used  ini- 
tially for  certain  clearing  and  credit  transactions  and  ultimately 
as  a  common  European  currency.  Deutsche  marks  became  the 
largest  element  in  the  backing  of  the  ECU. 

When  the  EMS  and  its  companion,  the  ERM,  were  formally 
established  on  March  25,  1979,  Schmidt's  role  committed  Ger- 
many to  their  success.  Thus,  West  Germans  became  involved  in 
an  area  of  European  economic  policy  that  was  of  the  utmost 
sensitivity  to  them.  They  did  not  do  so  without  some  reserva- 
tions. But  they  saw  no  alternative. 

The  EMS  and  especially  the  ERM  succeeded  in  making  West- 
ern  Europe  something  of  a  zone  of  stability  around  the 
deutsche  mark.  After  a  difficult  beginning,  marked  by  frequent 


327 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

currency  realignments  during  the  early  and  mid-1980s,  the 
exchange  rates  of  the  ERM  currencies  were  much  more  stable 
relative  to  each  other  than  in  relation  to  the  United  States  dol- 
lar or  the  Japanese  yen  until  1992. 

However  one  might  choose  to  allot  credit  for  the  success  of 
the  EMS  and  ERM,  they  represented  both  a  theoretical  setback 
and  a  practical  triumph  for  the  Bundesbank,  because  they 
showed  that  the  monetarist  school  might  well  have  been  cor- 
rect and  that  a  stable  ERM,  accompanied  by  a  commitment  to 
hold  to  the  agreed  rates,  could  compel  states  and  their  central 
banks  to  pursue  congruent  policies  as  long  as  they  were  deter- 
mined to  stay  within  a  system.  The  effectiveness  of  the  EMS  and 
ERM  also  suggested  that  a  system  of  fixed  exchange  rates  might 
act  as  a  catalyst  in  facilitating  policy  because  it  would  give  states 
an  additional  reason  to  coordinate  and  could  be  said  to  pro- 
vide a  sanction  if  they  failed  to  coordinate. 

It  has  often  been  said  that  the  ERM  represents  a  "deutsche- 
mark  zone"  within  the  EU.  The  deutsche  mark  has  been  the 
EU's  lead  currency,  the  principal  intervention  currency,  the 
principal  reserve  currency,  and  its  psychological  as  well  as  prac- 
tical anchor. 

During  the  twelve  years  from  the  onset  of  the  ERM  to  the 
Maastricht  summit  in  1991,  the  revaluation  of  the  deutsche 
mark  against  other  ERM  currencies  had  been  38  percent 
(including  58  percent  against  the  Italian  lira  and  45  percent 
against  the  French  franc),  but  most  of  the  revaluation  had 
taken  place  early  in  that  period,  with  the  practice  becoming 
much  less  common  after  the  mid-1980s.  At  the  end  of  the 
1980s,  it  could  be  said  that  the  ERM  had  been  a  considerable 
success  for  all  the  states  involved.  But  it  had  mainly  been  a  suc- 
cess for  West  Germany,  demonstrating  the  benefits  to  others  of 
associating  themselves  with  West  Germany's  economic  philoso- 
phy. 

The  members  of  the  EC  decided  even  before  the  end  of  the 
1980s  to  explore  further  monetary  cooperation  as  the  commu- 
nity advanced  toward  the  single  market.  In  June  1988,  at  the 
European  Council  meeting  in  Hanover,  they  established  a  com- 
mission chaired  by  the  president  of  the  European  Commission, 
Jacques  Delors,  to  study  and  propose  "concrete  stages  leading 
toward  economic  and  monetary  union."  Delors's  report,  sub- 
mitted on  April  17,  1989,  envisaged  a  transition  in  three  stages 
toward  an  EMU  with  a  single  common  currency.  The  objectives 
of  the  first  stage,  to  commence  on  July  1,  1990,  were  to  expand

the  ERM  to  include  all  EC  members,  to  permit  free  capital 
flows,  and  to  take  other  measures  toward  coordinating  eco- 
nomic and  monetary  policies.  In  the  second  stage,  for  which 
no  starting  date  was  then  proposed,  a  European  system  of  cen- 
tral banks  would  be  created,  leading  to  the  formation  of  a  sin- 
gle central  bank.  In  the  third  stage,  a  single  currency  managed 
by  a  European  central  bank  would  be  created,  and  even  greater 
powers  would  be  granted  to  the  EC  to  establish  common  finan- 
cial policies  among  its  members. 

After  the  Delors  Plan  was  announced,  the  West  German  gov- 
ernment and  the  Bundesbank  reacted  cautiously,  although 
both  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  the  Bundesbank  had  helped 
to  draft  the  report.  Having  been  pleased  with  the  achievements 
of  the  ERM,  the  West  Germans  were  prepared  to  examine  an 
arrangement  that  would  go  further  toward  monetary  union. 
But  they  were  not  ready  to  agree  to  anything  that  would  upset 
what  they  regarded  as  the  foundations  of  their  own  prosperity. 
The  Bundesbank  in  particular  wanted  to  make  certain  that  any 
European  system  would  reflect  its  own  thinking. 

Germany  and  the  European  Monetary  Union 

Germany  played  a  major  role  in  shaping  the  currency  provi- 
sions of  the  Treaty  on  European  Union  signed  in  December 
1991  in  Maastricht,  the  Netherlands,  especially  in  making  cer- 
tain that  those  provisions  would  assure  a  stable  European  cur- 
rency. In  broad  terms,  the  agreement,  often  referred  to  as  the 
Maastricht  Treaty,  provided  for  the  same  three  phases  earlier 
proposed  in  the  Delors  report,  although  with  later  deadlines 
for  each  phase.  It  also  provided  for  a  transitional  stage  to  eco- 
nomic and  monetary  union  to  begin  in  January  1994  with  the 
creation  of  the  European  Monetary  Institute.  The  institute  was 
given  a  mandate  to  coordinate  EU  members'  monetary  policy, 
to  oversee  preparations  for  the  transfer  to  a  European  cur- 
rency, and  to  create  the  right  conditions  for  the  final  stage  of 
monetary  reform — a  European  System  of  Central  Banks 
(ESCB),  a  single  European  Central  Bank  (ECB),  and  a  com- 
mon currency. 

The  ESCB  and  ECB  agreed  upon  at  Maastricht  are  the  types 
of  institutions  the  Bundesbank  might  welcome.  Their  common 
mandate  was  to  assure  price  stability  and  a  stable  European  cur- 
rency, although  the  ECB  was  also  instructed  to  ensure  sustain- 
able growth  with  high  employment.  The  structure  of  the  ECB 
itself  was  to  resemble  that  of  the  Bundesbank  (see  The  Bundes- 


329 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

bank,  ch.  5).  Its  council,  like  the  Bundesbank's  executive  Direk- 
torium  (Directorate — see  Glossary),  would  consist  of  an 
executive  board  and  the  presidents  of  those  national  banks 
whose  currencies  qualified  for  entry  into  the  EMU.  The  ECB 
would  be  independent  of  political  control,  and  the  central 
banks  of  all  European  states  would  be  independent  of  such 
control  even  before  the  end  of  the  first  stage  of  the  EMU. 
Thus,  the  principles  guiding  the  Bundesbank  and  the  deutsche 
mark  would  also  guide  the  ECB  and  the  future  European  cur- 
rency. 

The  Maastricht  principals  agreed  that  the  final  stage  in  the 
movement  toward  the  EMU  would  begin  in  1997  if  the  Euro- 
pean Council  decided  that  a  majority  of  EU  members  had  met 
five  convergence  criteria:  inflation  within  1.5  percent  of  the 
average  of  the  three  best  (i.e.,  lowest)  rates;  long-term  interest 
rates  within  2  percent  of  the  three  best  rates;  a  budget  deficit  of 
less  than  3  percent  of  GDP;  a  national  debt  of  less  than  60  per- 
cent of  GDP;  and  a  stable  currency,  as  shown  by  conformity 
with  the  narrow  band  of  the  ERM  and  an  absence  of  devalua- 
tions within  two  years  of  the  council's  decision  to  move  toward 
a  European  currency.  If  the  majority  of  EU  members  did  not 
meet  these  convergence  standards,  the  EMU  was  to  start  in 
1999  with  as  many  members  as  had  met  the  criteria.  Britain  was 
authorized  to  leave  the  system.  At  France's  insistence,  however, 
Germany  was  required  to  enter  the  EMU  if  France  entered, 
thus  ensuring  that  the  Bundesbank  could  not  conduct  a  policy 
independent  of  a  European  system. 

The  convergence  criteria  reflect  the  Bundesbank's  determi- 
nation to  make  certain  that  no  unstable  currencies  enter  the 
EMU.  The  criteria  also  put  pressure  on  European  governments 
and  central  banks  to  begin  conforming  to  Bundesbank  princi- 
ples before  a  monetary  union  is  accomplished. 

The  Maastricht  formula  represents  a  compromise  between 
the  monetarist  and  the  economist  camps  on  the  issue  of  Euro- 
pean integration.  It  pleased  the  monetarists — and  thus  the 
French — by  establishing  a  strict  calendar  for  the  transitional 
stages  to  the  EMU  and  by  using  monetary  policy  and  the  desire 
for  a  common  currency  to  compel  the  European  economies' 
acceptance  of  convergence.  The  formula  pleased  the  econo- 
mists— and  thus  the  Bundesbank — by  making  EMU  member- 
ship subject  to  the  kind  of  criteria  that  would  force 
governments  and  central  banks  to  pursue  similar  policies  even 
before  the  final  stage  of  the  EMU.  Most  important,  from  the 


330 


International  Economic  Relations 


standpoint  of  the  economists  and  the  Bundesbank,  it  created  a 
standard  for  EMU  membership. 

Although  the  Maastricht  arrangements  were  designed  to 
please  the  Bundesbank  and  to  assuage  German  concerns,  the 
German  people  reacted  negatively.  Popular  media  depicted 
"Germany's  beloved  deutsche  mark"  vanishing  into  the  dis- 
tance or  sinking  into  a  swamp,  and  opinion  surveys  revealed 
fears  that  the  politicians  had  surrendered  the  cornerstone  of 
German  prosperity  for  the  sake  of  a  united  Europe.  If  the 
Maastricht  provisions  for  the  EMU  had  been  subject  to  a  refer- 
endum in  Germany,  they  almost  certainly  would  have  failed  to 
gain  a  majority. 

The  German  government  had  to  offer  repeated  assurances 
that  it  would  never  give  up  the  deutsche  mark  for  another  cur- 
rency that  was  not  as  strong  or  as  stable.  It  took  some  time  for 
the  German  public  even  to  entertain  the  notion  that  savings 
might  one  day  be  held  in  a  currency  other  than  the  deutsche 
mark,  and  the  public  consistently  made  clear  that  it  would 
accept  that  prospect  only  if  that  currency  were  as  strong  as  the 
deutsche  mark. 

The  Bundesbank's  Central  Bank  Council  followed  the  Maas- 
tricht summit  with  a  formal  statement  reiterating  a  number  of 
well-known  Bundesbank  positions.  In  the  statement,  the  coun- 
cil expressed  regret  that  monetary  union  was  moving  forward 
more  rapidly  than  a  "comprehensive  political  union."  It  stated 
that  such  a  political  union  was  necessary  if  monetary  union 
were  to  be  effective.  The  council  also  warned  that  the  success 
of  any  decisions  taken  on  the  path  toward  the  envisaged  eco- 
nomic and  monetary  union  had  to  be  judged  "solely  on  their 
stability  performance"  and  that  "the  fulfillment  of  the  entry  cri- 
teria of  the  convergence  conditions  must  not  be  impaired  by 
any  dates  set."  The  Bundesbank  stressed  that  the  policy  unit  of 
the  EMU  would  be  the  ESCB — in  which  the  Bundesbank  could 
expect  to  have  a  strong  voice — with  the  ECB  to  be  subsidiary  to 
the  ESCB  and  thus  subject  to  the  Bundesbank's  influence.  It 
also  stressed  that  the  deutsche  mark  and  the  European  cur- 
rency would  coexist  for  some  time  at  fixed  exchange  rates  until 
all  the  conditions  had  been  set  for  a  European  currency  that 
would  actually  displace  all  national  currencies.  The  Bundes- 
bank also  reiterated  the  importance  of  having  the  ESCB  and 
ECB  remain  completely  independent  of  national  governments. 

Both  the  German  government  and  the  Bundesbank  wanted 
the  new  ECB  to  be  located  in  Frankfurt  am  Main.  To  this  end, 


331 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 


the  Bundesbank  and  German  officials  indicated  that  they 
would  make  every  effort  to  enhance  the  appeal  of  Germany 
and  Frankfurt  in  particular  as  financial  centers,  although  the 
bank  warned  that  Germany  should  not  take  steps  that  could 
jeopardize  financial  stability  for  the  sake  of  competitiveness  by 
loosening  German  financial  standards.  The  Institut  fur  Kapital- 
marktforschung  (Institute  for  Research  on  Capital  Markets) 
urged  fast  action  to  boost  Frankfurt,  warning  that  a  more  finan- 
cially integrated  Europe  would  tend  toward  a  single  financial 
capital  and  that  London  and  Paris  were  not  only  better  placed 
than  Frankfurt  but  also  were  making  much  greater  efforts  to 
emerge  as  dominant  financial  centers. 

But  Bundesbank  officials  had  more  on  their  minds  in  early 
1992  than  the  Maastricht  conditions  for  the  EMU  and  the  loca- 
tion of  Europe's  future  financial  center.  The  bank  was  attempt- 
ing to  establish  German  monetary  union  within  the  recently 
united  Germany,  as  well  as  to  prepare  for  European  unity,  and 
was  finding  neither  task  particularly  easy.  The  Bundesbank 
could  have  been  expected  to  react  guardedly  to  the  Maastricht 
Treaty  no  matter  what  its  terms  might  have  been.  But  the  fact 
that  the  treaty  was  signed  as  the  bank  was  trying  to  deal  with 
the  German  government's  large  fiscal  deficits  and  the  resulting 
upsurge  in  the  German  money  supply  made  the  Bundesbank 
both  more  hesitant  about  proceeding  toward  the  EMU  and 
more  assertive  in  its  insistence  on  what  it  considered  the 
proper  conditions. 

Since  the  early  1970s,  the  Bundesbank  had  effectively  con- 
trolled European  monetary  policy.  The  deutsche  mark  had 
been  the  anchor  currency  of  the  snake  and  of  the  EMS  and 
ERM.  But  the  Bundesbank  would  become  only  one  of  many 
banks  with  a  voice  on  the  new  council.  The  president  of  the 
ECB  might  well  be  a  German,  and  the  ECB  might  be  based  in 
Germany,  but  many  different  banks  would  have  a  voice  in  Euro- 
pean monetary  policy,  in  effect  removing  the  Bundesbank's  vir- 
tual monopoly  of  authority.  Some  of  those  banks,  even  if  they 
were  to  meet  the  Maastricht  convergence  criteria,  might  occa- 
sionally want  to  pursue  policies  different  from  those  of  the 
Bundesbank. 

More  problematic  for  the  Bundesbank  was  the  recognition 
that  those  other  banks,  through  their  influence  on  European 
monetary  policy,  would  have  a  voice  in  German  monetary  pol- 
icy, because  the  EMU  could  not  function  if  separate  states  and 
central  banks  could  ignore  any  ECB  policy  they  disliked.  The

Bundesbank  might  not  only  lose  control  over  European  money 
but  perhaps  over  German  money  as  well.  Such  a  situation 
could  violate  the  bank's  own  basic  mandate,  and  it  would  cer- 
tainly violate  its  stability  doctrine  if  the  ECB  failed  to  pursue 
what  the  Bundesbank  perceived  as  the  right  kind  of  policy. 

The  Bundesbank  responded  to  these  multiple  challenges  by 
setting  forth  on  a  course  that  was  designed  to  put  the  indelible 
imprint  of  its  philosophy  on  the  new  bank  and  the  new  cur- 
rency, or,  if  that  were  not  possible,  either  to  break  up  the  EMU 
or  to  make  it  so  selective  that  only  a  few  countries  could  join. 
Thus  the  bank  became  engaged  in  a  rigid,  even  doctrinaire, 
assertion  of  the  primacy  of  currency  stability.  It  proceeded  to 
raise  short-term  interest  rates  throughout  1991  and  much  of 
1992,  before  and  after  Maastricht.  Although  it  did  so  primarily 
for  domestic  reasons,  it  was  certainly  mindful  of  the  effect  that 
its  policies  would  have  on  other  European  currencies.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

As  German  interest  rates  rose,  other  European  currencies 
and  central  banks  found  it  difficult  to  match  German  policies 
at  home.  The  recession  that  had  hit  Germany  spread  through- 
out Europe,  in  part  for  cyclical  reasons  but  also  because  of  the 
forced  emulation  of  Bundesbank  policies  by  countries  inter- 
ested in  joining  the  EMU.  As  the  recession  spread,  several 
countries  could  not  support  their  currencies  except  at  the  cost 
of  an  ever-greater  slowdown. 

An  exchange-rate  crisis  erupted  in  September  1992,  after 
several  countries  had  decided  that  they  could  no  longer  keep 
up  with  German  interest  rates.  As  those  central  banks  began  to 
lower  short-term  rates,  investors  began  to  abandon  their  cur- 
rencies, and  speculators  began  to  dump  them.  In  response  to 
desperate  pleas  from  abroad  and  from  large  segments  of  the 
German  political  and  economic  communities,  the  Bundesbank 
lowered  its  Lombard  rate  (see  Glossary),  but  only  by  a  quarter 
point.  Within  days,  the  Italian  lira  had  to  be  devalued  and 
taken  out  of  the  ERM.  The  British  pound  also  came  under 
attack.  This  triggered  "Black  Wednesday,"  September  16,  1992, 
when  the  pound  crashed  while  the  Bundesbank  refused  to  sup- 
port it.  As  a  result,  Britain  withdrew  the  pound  from  the  ERM. 

Only  the  French  franc  and  the  smaller  currencies  tradition- 
ally tied  to  the  deutsche  mark  (such  as  the  Belgian  franc,  the 
Dutch  guilder,  and  the  Danish  krone)  did  not  devalue,  thus 
remaining  in  the  ERM.  All  other  EC  currencies  effectively 
devalued  against  the  deutsche  mark.  The  defense  of  the 
French  franc  cost  the  Bundesbank  and  the  Banque  de  France 
tens  of  billions  of  deutsche  marks,  on  which  they  realized  a 
small  profit  after  the  French  currency  had  stabilized.  More 
important,  however,  it  cost  the  Bundesbank  its  reputation  for 
objectivity,  at  least  in  London,  because  the  British  complained 
that  their  currency  had  not  been  supported  as  the  franc  had 
been. 

In  August  1993,  a  similar  crisis  erupted,  but  this  time  the  cur- 
rency under  attack  was  the  French  franc.  With  French  inflation 
rates  lower  than  those  of  Germany,  the  Banque  de  France 
began  lowering  short-term  interest  rates  during  the  spring  of 
1993  and  continued  lowering  them  throughout  the  summer. 
The  French  bank  may  have  assumed  that  the  background  of 
firm  French  monetary  policy  since  the  mid-1980s  would  give  it 
some  leeway  to  lower  short-term  rates  below  the  Bundesbank 
levels  without  weakening  the  franc.  In  the  event,  this  proved 
incorrect.  A  full  assault  on  the  franc  erupted  in  August.  Even  a 


334 


International  Economic  Relations 


coordinated  intervention  by  the  Bundesbank  and  other  institu- 
tions failed,  and  the  franc  weakened  rapidly. 

To  help  protect  the  franc,  and  to  avoid  having  to  expend 
more  resources  in  a  futile  fight,  the  ERJVI  countries  agreed  that 
they  would  widen  the  bands  in  which  currencies  could  diverge 
from  each  other  from  2.25  percent  to  15.0  percent.  They 
assumed,  correctly,  that  this  change  would  stop  the  speculative 
assault  on  the  franc.  However,  it  also  signified  the  collapse  of 
the  franc,  one  of  the  main  currencies  of  the  EMS.  Only  a  few 
minor  currencies  remained  as  stable  as  the  deutsche  mark. 
However,  the  franc  was  able  to  recover  later  in  1993  to  virtual 
parity  with  the  deutsche  mark. 

The  two  ERM  crises  left  the  prospects  for  the  EMU  uncer- 
tain. It  seemed  unlikely  that  more  than  two  or  three  minor  cur- 
rencies would  be  able  to  meet  the  convergence  criteria  by 
1997,  and  the  system  could  not  then  come  into  effect  because 
it  would  not  include  the  majority  of  the  countries  of  the  EU. 
Under  those  circumstances,  the  earliest  possible  date  for  the 
EMU  to  take  effect  would  be  1999,  and  even  that  target  date 
would  come  into  question  if  the  EMU  at  that  point  were  to 
encompass  nothing  more  than  the  deutsche  mark,  the  French 
franc,  and  some  minor  currencies.  The  German  minister  for 
economics,  Gunter  Rexrodt,  predicted  in  mid-1994  that  the 
EMU  might  not  come  about  until  2001  or  later. 

The  Bundesbank  had  shown  its  readiness  to  exercise  its 
power  to  shape  and  even  to  dictate  the  policies  of  other  central 
banks.  It  had  shown  that,  if  Europe  were  no  longer  to  be  domi- 
nated by  the  Bundesbank  itself,  it  should  at  least  be  dominated 
by  the  Bundesbank's  ideals.  The  bank's  Central  Bank  Council 
hoped  that  others  would  come  to  appreciate  the  value  of  stable 
money  through  the  experience  of  having  unstable  money.  But 
in  case  all  central  banks  did  not  agree,  Bundesbank  president 
Tietmeyer  said  after  the  September  1992  crisis  that  the  bank 
was  prepared  to  accept  what  he  called  " gestaffeltes  Vorgehen" 
(membership  by  stages),  a  process  by  which  some  states  would 
join  before  others.  The  bank  was  clearly  prepared  to  forego  the 
EMU,  or  at  least  to  postpone  it,  if  the  EMU  might  bring 
unqualified  members  into  a  common  European  currency  sys- 
tem. And  it  was  prepared  to  split  the  EMU,  if  necessary,  to  cre- 
ate at  least  a  partial  zone  of  European  currency  stability. 

The  bank's  stern  views  should  not  lead  to  the  conclusion  that 
the  Bundesbank  opposes  a  European  currency.  Indeed,  several 
senior  Bundesbank  figures  have  at  various  times  expressed 


335 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

their  conviction  that  a  common  European  currency  is  desir- 
able. Such  a  currency  would  ease  one  of  the  burdens  felt  by  the 
Bundesbank:  it  must  now  defend  stability  with  only  its  own 
reserves  and  those  of  its  immediate  allies  instead  of  with  the 
reserves  of  an  entire  continent.  Former  Central  Bank  Council 
member  Leonhard  Gleske  once  spoke  with  envy  about  how  the 
large  domestic  market  of  the  United  States  helped  the  dollar 
adjust  more  easily  than  any  single  European  currency  to  global 
fluctuations  and  crises.  Gleske  also  observed  that  one  of  the 
objectives  of  a  European  currency  would  be  to  assume  the  lead- 
ing international  role  that  even  the  deutsche  mark  could  not 
assume  and  that  such  a  European  currency  could  gradually 
replace  the  dollar  as  a  transactions  and  reserve  currency.  This 
prospect  must  be  a  powerful  incentive  for  the  Bundesbank, 
which  has  long  distrusted  United  States  monetary  and  fiscal 
policies. 

The  crises  of  1992  and  1993  did  not  discourage  other  EU 
members  from  accepting  Bundesbank  discipline.  They  agreed 
later  in  1993  to  place  the  new  European  Monetary  Institute  as 
well  as  the  future  ECB  in  Frankfurt.  That  decision  was  a  vote  of 
confidence,  or  at  least  acceptance,  for  Bundesbank  policies 
and  attitudes,  because  Frankfurt  is  not  only  the  home  of  the 
Bundesbank  but  is  also  regarded  as  the  capital  of  German 
monetarist  thinking. 

A  full  EMU  will  come  about  when  the  Bundesbank  is  satis- 
fied that  all  European  governments  are  fully  committed  to  sta- 
bility and  when  they  have  shown  this  commitment  by  adhering 
to  the  convergence  criteria  and  by  passing  whatever  other  tests 
the  bank  may  yet  pose.  As  Bundesbank  officials  have  said  on 
every  possible  occasion,  the  Bundesbank  believes  that  a  stable 
currency  is  more  important  than  a  common  currency.  And  the 
German  government,  although  it  supports  the  EMU,  must 
accept  the  Bundesbank's  policies  if  it  is  to  secure  the  support  of 
the  German  people  for  a  common  European  currency. 

Foreign  Trade  and  Investment 

Trade  Philosophy  and  the  Trade  Balance 

West  Germany  has  been  one  of  the  world's  major  trading 
nations,  almost  from  the  first  days  of  the  economic  miracle  that 
began  in  the  early  1950s  (see  The  Economic  Miracle  and 
Beyond,  ch.  5).  It  also  had  high  trade  and  current-account  sur- 
pluses during  most  of  these  years,  especially  during  the  latter 


336 


International  Economic  Relations 


half  of  the  1980s  (see  table  20,  Appendix).  It  was  the  world's 
largest  exporter  in  1988,  second  largest  after  the  United  States 
in  1989,  and  first  again  in  1990  if  East  German  exports  before 
monetary  unification  in  mid-1990  are  included.  West  Germany 
was  also  consistently  one  of  the  world's  largest  importers. 

Ludwig  Erhard  set  the  tone  for  the  future  of  German  trade 
policy  and  practice  when  he  was  minister  for  economics  in  the 
early  days  of  the  Federal  Republic.  He  made  his  own  senti- 
ments very  clear,  saying  in  1953  that  "foreign  trade  is  not  a  spe- 
cialized activity  for  a  few  who  might  engage  in  it,  but  it  is  the 
very  core  and  even  the  precondition  of  our  economic  and 
social  order."  Commentators  and  authors  on  the  German  econ- 
omy speak  of  a  German  "export  mystique,"  of  deliberate 
domestic  underconsumption  to  facilitate  exports  and  increase 
competitiveness,  and  of  an  "almost  unconscious"  German  mer- 
cantilism. The  export  sector  has  a  powerful  voice  in  German 
economic  and  commercial  policy  making,  including  a  special 
Foreign  Trade  Advisory  Council  located  in  the  Ministry  for 
Economics.  Senior  German  political  figures  rarely  make  visits 
abroad  without  including  select  German  businesspeople  in 
their  official  delegations. 

The  German  economy  has  failed  to  heed  the  export  mys- 
tique only  once,  when  the  Hitler  regime  (1933-45)  sought 
autarchy,  or  economic  independence  from  the  global  econ- 
omy. Between  1910  and  1913,  exports  accounted  for  17.8  per- 
cent of  Germany's  GDP.  Their  share  declined  to  14.9  percent 
in  the  second  half  of  the  1920s  and  fell  to  only  6  percent  in  the 
second  half  of  the  1930s,  but  by  1950  accounted  for  9.3  percent 
of  West  Germany's  GDP.  Once  the  postwar  economic  boom  got 
under  way,  exports  rose  to  17.2  percent  of  GDP  in  1960,  to  23.8 
percent  in  1970,  to  26.7  percent  in  1980,  and  to  approximately 
33  percent  in  1990. 

Investment  goods  produced  by  West  German  industry  were 
the  most  successful  export  items  and  contributed  most  heavily 
to  the  country's  large  trade  surplus,  although  West  Germany 
was  competitive  across  a  wide  range  of  goods.  The  country 
imported  more  agricultural  and  processed  food  products  than 
it  exported  (see  table  21,  Appendix). 

A  number  of  West  German  industries  dedicated  significant 
percentages  of  their  production  for  export:  shipbuilding,  62 
percent;  air  and  space,  59  percent;  automotive  products,  48 
percent;  machine  tools,  45  percent;  chemicals,  44  percent;  iron 


337 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

and  steel,  37  percent;  and  precision  mechanics  and  optics,  31 
percent. 

Several  of  the  industries  with  a  high  export  share,  such  as 
shipbuilding  and  airframes,  were  heavily  subsidized  in  West 
Germany  and  have  continued  to  be  subsidized  in  united  Ger- 
many. They  are  competitive  in  world  markets  on  the  basis  of 
those  subsidies.  The  subsidies  demonstrate  the  extent  of  the 
German  export  commitment.  West  Germany  would  have  had  a 
substantial  trade  surplus  even  without  the  subsidized  products 
of  those  industries,  but  it  did  not  wish  to  sacrifice  their  global 
market  share. 

After  German  unification,  Germany's  trade  surplus  shrank 
for  several  years.  Whereas  West  Germany  had  shown  a  dramati- 
cally high  trade  surplus  during  the  late  1980s  until  1990,  reach- 
ing almost  US$80  billion  in  1988,  united  Germany  by  1991  was 
showing  a  much  smaller  surplus.  Nonetheless,  it  was  widely 
expected  that  large  surpluses  would  return  by  the  mid-1990s  as 
the  Lander  of  the  former  East  Germany  began  to  export  more 
and  required  fewer  imports. 

Especially  crucial  to  the  future  foreign  trade  position  of 
united  Germany  will  be  the  competitiveness  of  industry  in  the 
new  Lander  of  the  former  East  Germany,  which  could  not  be 
predicted  with  any  reliability  in  the  years  immediately  following 
unification.  During  1993  only  2  percent  of  German  exports 
came  from  the  new  Lander.  It  was  unclear  whether  this  area's 
competitiveness  had  been  destroyed,  or  whether  the  West  Ger- 
man producers  that  had  bought  East  German  firms  had 
decided  to  continue  to  export  from  their  western  firms  instead 
of  from  their  newly  acquired  eastern  firms.  Whatever  hap- 
pened, it  is  worth  remembering  that  the  new  Lander,  like  the 
western  Lander,  had  generated  a  consistent  trade  surplus  in 
capital  and  transport  equipment,  industrial  consumer  goods, 
and  chemicals  before  unification.  They  could  be  expected  to 
return  to  competitiveness  in  at  least  some  of  those  areas.  East 
Germany  also  suffered  from  several  major  shortages  before 
unification,  having  trade  deficits  in  fuels,  raw  materials,  semi- 
manufactures, agricultural  products,  and  processed  foods. 
Most  of  those  deficits  would  persist  even  after  unification. 

With  Germany  united,  the  government  expects  trade  with 
Eastern  Europe  to  increase  well  over  the  levels  West  Germany 
had  enjoyed  and  ultimately  to  exceed  the  level  of  separate  East 
German  and  West  German  trade  with  Eastern  Europe  before 
unification.  In  fact,  Germany's  most  important  and  most  con- 


338 


International  Economic  Relations 


sistent  policy  since  1990  has  been  to  improve  its  connections  to 
Eastern  Europe  without  loosening  its  links  to  the  West  and  thus 
to  bring  Eastern  Europe  and  Western  Europe  together.  After 
the  fall  of  communism,  German  business  representatives  began 
visiting  Eastern  Europe  in  large  numbers  to  establish  or  rees- 
tablish trade  connections  and  to  inspect  potential  investment 
sites  or  joint  ventures. 

German  economic  links  and  outposts  are  being  reestab- 
lished in  Central  Europe  and  Eastern  Europe.  The  Czech 
Republic  is  again  becoming  an  integral  part  of  the  industrial 
complex  centered  in  Bavaria  and  Saxony,  as  Bohemia  and 
Moravia  were  before  World  War  I.  The  frontier  region  between 
Poland  and  Germany  is  already  one  of  the  most  active  border 
investment  and  trading  centers  in  the  world,  beginning  to 
emulate  the  Mexico-United  States  border  and  the  Hong  Kong 
hinterland  as  a  place  where  Western  capital  meets  non-Western 
labor  and  where  goods  are  processed  and  exchanged  freely. 
Cross-border  traffic  in  goods  and  persons  is  burgeoning.  Ger- 
man trade  and  investment  being  planned  for  the  countries  of 
the  former  Soviet  Union  and  for  Eastern  Europe  will  make 
united  Germany  by  far  the  largest  single  Western  trading  part- 
ner as  well  as  the  largest  Western  creditor  of  those  states. 

Germany  has  provided  more  aid  and  investment  to  the 
former  Soviet  republics  than  any  other  West  European  state, 
contributing  US$52  billion  in  aid  to  Russia  and  other  members 
of  the  former  Soviet  Union  between  1989  and  1993  as  well  as 
US$25  billion  to  the  states  of  Central  and  Eastern  Europe. 
More  than  one-half  of  East  European  and  Baltic  trade  with  the 
EU  is  with  Germany.  Other  types  of  economic  activities  are  also 
becoming  common.  For  example,  by  1994  the  Deutsche  Bank 
had  opened  a  branch  office  in  Prague  and  planned  to  open 
others  throughout  Eastern  Europe. 

As  part  of  that  effort  to  speed  the  East's  integration  with 
Western  Europe,  Germany  has  not  only  endorsed  but  has  often 
sponsored  association  agreements  with  the  EU  for  the  states  of 
Eastern  Europe  and  the  former  Soviet  Union.  It  has  also  spon- 
sored several  East  European  applications  for  EU  membership. 
Kohl  himself  told  Hungarians  and  Czechs  in  April  1994  that 
the  EU  without  their  countries  would  be  a  "torso."  A  month 
earlier,  he  told  the  Baltic  states  that  they  belonged  in  the  EU  as 
much  as  the  Mediterranean  states.  Kohl  also  strongly  advo- 
cated Russian  membership  in  the  annual  Group  of  Seven  (G- 
7)  meetings — at  least  for  political  discussions.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

The  credits  that  Germany  has  been  giving  to  its  Eastern 
trading  partners  are  not  without  risk.  Russian  and  East  Euro- 
pean debt  has  been  accumulating  for  several  decades.  Virtually 
every  East  European  state  had  trouble  servicing  its  debts  dur- 
ing the  early  1990s,  and  special  arrangements  had  to  be  made 
to  reschedule  Poland's  debt.  Nonetheless,  the  German  govern- 
ment and  German  banks  were  prepared  to  extend  further 
credits  despite  nagging  doubts  about  when  the  credits  would 
be  repaid.  German  determination  to  increase  trade  with  East- 
ern Europe  and  to  invest  more  in  that  area  reflects  tradition  as 
well  as  economic  and  political  interest.  Moreover,  Germany  is 
better  located  than  any  other  West  European  state  to  trade  with 
Eastern  Europe,  especially  because  Berlin  remains  one  of  the 
most  attractive  potential  production,  assembly,  service,  and 
transportation  centers  for  East  European  trade. 

International  Investment  in  and  by  Germany 

Before  unification,  West  Germany  had  been  a  principal 
exporter  of  capital.  This  status  was  indicative  of  the  capital  sur- 
plus the  country's  firms  and  banks  held  abroad  as  a  result  of 
export  earnings,  but  it  was  also  a  sign  of  the  growing  disparity 
between  production  costs  in  West  Germany  and  abroad.  Many 
West  German  manufacturers  preferred  to  produce  in  other 
countries  where  lower  costs  might  give  them  a  greater  competi- 
tive edge  than  they  might  have  operating  from  a  West  German 
base.  Therefore,  during  most  of  the  years  between  1960  and 
1989,  and  especially  during  the  1980s,  the  amount  of  West  Ger- 
man investment  abroad  exceeded  the  level  of  foreign  invest- 
ment in  West  Germany. 

West  German  and  later  German  direct  investment  abroad 
remained  high  even  around  the  time  of  unification,  totaling 
DM37.4  billion  in  1990,  DM37.1  billion  in  1991,  and  DM28.1 
billion  in  1992.  During  those  years,  foreign  direct  investment 
in  West  Germany  or  unified  Germany  never  exceeded  DM6.2 
billion  per  year. 

The  nature  of  West  Germany's  investment  abroad  was  differ- 
ent from  foreign  investment  in  West  Germany.  About  one- 
fourth  to  one-third,  and  sometimes  as  much  as  one-half,  of 
West  German  investment  abroad  during  the  1970s  and  1980s 
represented  direct  investment  in  production  facilities,  the 
remainder  being  investment  in  various  forms  of  long-term 
credits  such  as  equities,  bonds,  and  long-term  bank  deposits. 
However,  relatively  little  foreign  investment  in  West  Germany 


340

during  that  period  was  in  production  facilities,  with  the  annual 
share  ranging  from  about  one-twentieth  to  one-sixth  of  all  for- 
eign investment.  Instead,  the  dominant  form  of  investment  in 
West  Germany  was  in  West  German  equities  and  bonds. 

Foreign  investment  in  German  stocks  and  bonds  was  espe- 
cially heavy  during  the  early  1990s.  During  1991  that  invest- 
ment amounted  to  DM37.4  billion;  in  1992  it  rose  to  DM62.0 
billion.  Both  amounts  were  far  higher  than  foreign  investment 
in  German  securities  during  any  earlier  year.  As  a  result,  Ger- 
many had  a  long-term  capital  surplus  of  DM46.6  billion  during 
1992,  the  highest  amount  West  Germany  or  unified  Germany 
had  ever  recorded  and  a  striking  departure  from  West  Ger- 
many's chronic  capital  deficit. 

According  to  Bundesbank  statistics,  one-fifth  of  all  German 
securities  at  the  end  of  1990  belonged  to  foreigners,  and  one- 
half  of  all  German  publicly  offered  obligations  between  1986 


341 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

and  1990  had  been  bought  by  foreigners.  Much  of  the  invest- 
ment appears  to  have  been  motivated  by  the  expectation  that 
the  deutsche  mark  would  appreciate  and  that  investment  in 
German  funds  would  thus  produce  an  exchange  profit  as  well 
as  regular  income.  Much  of  it  may  also  have  reflected  the  sense 
that  German  long-term  interest  rates  would  decline  as  the  bur- 
dens of  unification  eased. 

Because  of  the  large  amount  of  German  direct  investment 
abroad,  German  income  from  foreign  investments  exceeds 
income  of  foreigners  investing  in  Germany.  Bundesbank  statis- 
tics showed  that  the  net  return  on  West  German  capital  abroad 
had  risen  to  almost  DM25  billion  by  1989.  If  Germans  were 
going  abroad  to  invest,  they  were  drawing  a  significant  return 
income. 

In  1988,  of  West  German  foreign  investment,  52  percent  was 
in  Europe  (with  41  percent  in  EC  countries),  40  percent  was  in 
the  Americas  (with  28  percent  in  the  United  States),  and  only  6 
percent  was  in  Asia  (with  2  percent  in  Japan).  The  favorite  sites 
for  West  German  foreign  investment  were  France  and  Britain. 
A  fast-growing  amount  was  going  to  Eastern  Europe.  A  survey 
conducted  by  a  German  economic  institute  showed  that  more 
than  twice  as  much  new  German  investment  at  the  end  of  1993 
was  going  to  the  states  of  Central  Europe  and  Eastern  Europe 
as  to  West  European  states,  with  the  largest  amount  by  far 
going  to  the  Czech  Republic. 

The  structural  problems  of  German  production  were  com- 
pelling German  investors  to  abandon  production  in  Ger- 
many— including  eastern  Germany — and  were  making 
locations  in  other  countries  more  competitive.  Even  before 
unification,  many  German  industrialists  and  investors  had 
been  moving  German  production  facilities  to  other  EC  states, 
especially  Spain  and  Portugal,  or  to  the  United  States  or  other 
countries  where  labor  costs  were  lower.  German  efficiency, 
thoroughness,  and  quality  control  could  only  compensate  up 
to  a  point  for  the  cost  advantage  that  producers  in  other  coun- 
tries increasingly  enjoyed.  The  combination  of  high  labor 
costs,  a  high  level  of  subsidization,  and  a  strong  currency  was 
putting  German  producers  at  a  growing  disadvantage  at  pre- 
cisely the  moment  when  the  costs  of  unification  were  becoming 
particularly  burdensome. 

Foreign  Aid 

Although  Germany  is  a  leader  in  foreign  trade,  it  has  never 


342 


International  Economic  Relations 


been  generous  with  foreign  aid.  West  German  official  develop- 
mental assistance  between  1976  and  1989  ranged  between  0.40 
and  0.47  percent  of  German  GDP,  well  below  the  0.70  standard 
proposed  by  the  United  Nations  (UN).  German  aid  sank  to 
0.36  percent  of  GDP  in  1993  as  the  costs  of  unification  rein- 
forced the  reluctance  of  the  German  government  to  grant 
assistance.  But  German  private  contributions  to  international 
causes,  especially  for  humanitarian  purposes,  are  consistently 
high.  During  1992  those  contributions  matched  the  level  of 
official  assistance. 

Because  Germany  was  not  involved  in  the  wave  of  decoloni- 
zation that  followed  World  War  II,  it  has  not  had  the  special 
links  to  former  colonies  that  have  helped  to  motivate  and  chan- 
nel aid  by  such  former  colonial  powers  as  France  and  Britain. 
The  largest  portion  of  West  German  aid,  over  40  percent,  went 
to  Africa  during  the  1980s.  Earlier,  West  Germany  had  sent 
more  aid  to  Asia,  but  that  portion  fell  to  30  percent  during  the 
1980s  because  the  Asian  economic  boom  made  aid  less  neces- 
sary. Relatively  little  aid  went  to  the  Americas.

The  literature  on  German  external  economic  relations  is  as 
limited  as  the  general  literature  on  the  German  economy.  The 
most  comprehensive  current  books  in  English  are  The  German 
Economy  by  W.R.  Smyser  and  The  German  Economy  by  Eric  Owen 
Smith.  An  annual  economic  survey  of  Germany  published  by 
the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Develop- 
ment (OECD)  contains  current  information  on  German  exter- 
nal economic  relations,  as  does  the  OECD  biannual,  OECD 
Economic  Outlook.  The  Bundesbank  publishes  a  monthly  statisti- 
cal compilation  on  German  trade,  current  account,  and  for- 
eign investment  balances,  but  only  in  German. 

Two  books  about  the  specific  German  role  in  European  eco- 
nomics are  The  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  and  the  European  Com- 
munity by  Simon  Bulmer  and  William  Paterson  and  Germany's 
International  Monetary  Policy  and  the  European  Monetary  System  by 
Hugo  M.  Kaufmann.  A  work  that  offers  discussion  of  the  com- 
petitive weaknesses  of  the  German  economy  is  Die  japanisch- 
amerikanische  Herausforderung  by  Konrad  Seitz.  Several  books  on 
the  European  economy  and  the  EU  offer  some  information

Chapter  7.  Government  and  Politics 


Villa  Hammerschmidt,  the  residence  of  the  federal  president  in  Bonn 


AS  OF  MID-1995,  GERMANY  was  a  country  coming  to  terms 
with  the  recent  unification  of  its  western  and  eastern  portions 
following  four  decades  of  Cold  War  division.  Achieved  in  Octo- 
ber 1990,  German  unification  consisted,  in  effect,  of  the  incor- 
poration of  the  German  Democratic  Republic  (GDR,  or  East 
Germany)  into  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (FRG,  or 
West  Germany).  Thus,  the  unified  country,  rather  than  reflect- 
ing a  mix  of  both  states'  systems,  largely  represented  a  continu- 
ation of  the  West  German  political  and  economic  system.  West 
German  chancellor  Helmut  Kohl  preferred  this  "fast  track"  to 
unification,  outlined  in  Article  23  of  the  West  German  Basic 
Law,  or  constitution,  because  he  feared  that  international  cir- 
cumstances might  change  and  the  chance  for  unification 
might  be  missed.  The  alternative  path  to  unification,  detailed 
in  Article  146,  would  have  required  the  replacement  of  the 
Basic  Law  with  a  constitution  developed  specifically  for  a  uni- 
fied Germany. 

During  the  summer  of  1990,  the  governments  of  the  two 
German  states  drafted  a  1,000-page  treaty  outlining  the  terms 
of  political  union.  The  document  explained  how  the  political 
structures  and  policies  of  West  Germany  would  be  extended  to 
the  east,  how  other  institutions — such  as  the  education  sys- 
tem— would  be  coordinated,  and  which  issues  would  be 
resolved  later — for  instance,  abortion  policy.  The  parliaments 
of  both  German  states  ratified  the  treaty,  and  the  territory  of 
East  Germany  joined  the  Federal  Republic  under  Article  23  on 
October  3,  1990. 

The  West  German  system  of  government,  outlined  in  the 
Basic  Law,  reflects  in  particular  a  desire  to  transcend  the  inter- 
war  period  of  democratic  instability  and  dictatorship.  A  federal 
system  of  government,  considered  vital  to  a  stable,  constitu- 
tional democracy,  was  put  in  place  as  a  direct  response  to  les- 
sons learned  from  the  Nazis'  misuse  of  centralized  structures. 
After  four  years  of  Allied  occupation,  the  FRG  was  established 
in  1949.  The  country  attained  sovereignty  in  1955  when  the 
Allies  transferred  responsibility  for  national  security  to  the 
newly  formed  armed  forces,  the  Bundeswehr. 

Creating  a  climate  of  political  stability  was  a  primary  goal  of 
the  authors  of  West  Germany's  Basic  Law.  Among  other  things, 
the  Basic  Law  established  the  supremacy  of  political  parties  in 


347 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  system  of  government.  In  the  resulting  "party  state,"  all 
major  government  policies  emanated  from  the  organizational 
structure  of  the  political  parties.  In  the  decades  since  1949, 
West  Germany's  parties  have  tended  toward  the  middle  of  the 
political  spectrum,  largely  because  both  the  historical  experi- 
ence with  fascism  and  the  existence  of  communist  East  Ger- 
many greatly  diminished  the  appeal  of  either  extreme.  This 
reigning  political  consensus,  challenged  briefly  in  the  late 
1960s  by  the  student  protest  movement  and  in  the  early  1980s 
by  economic  recession,  has  led  many  observers  to  judge  the 
"Bonn  model"  a  success.  However,  it  remains  an  open  question 
whether  the  legal,  economic,  and  political  structures  of  the 
past  will  serve  the  unified  Germany  as  well  in  the  future. 

Constitutional  Framework 

The  Constitution 

The  framers  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany's  1949  con- 
stitution sought  to  create  safeguards  against  the  emergence  of 
either  an  overly  fragmented,  multiparty  democracy,  similar  to 
the  Weimar  Republic  (1918-33),  or  authoritarian  institutions 
characteristic  of  the  Nazi  dictatorship  of  the  Third  Reich 
(1933-45).  Thus,  negative  historical  experience  played  a  major 
role  in  shaping  the  constitution. 

Articles  1  through  19  delineate  basic  rights  that  apply  to  all 
German  citizens,  including  equality  before  the  law;  freedom  of 
speech,  assembly,  the  news  media,  and  worship;  freedom  from 
discrimination  based  on  race,  gender,  religion,  or  political 
beliefs;  and  the  right  to  conscientious  objection  to  compulsory 
military  service.  In  reaction  to  the  experience  of  the  Third 
Reich,  the  framers  of  the  Basic  Law  did,  however,  place  limits 
on  extremist  political  activities  that  might  threaten  to  subvert 
the  democratic  political  order.  Article  18  states:  "Whoever 
abuses  freedom  of  expression  of  opinion,  in  particular  free- 
dom of  the  press,  freedom  of  teaching,  freedom  of  assembly, 
freedom  of  association,  privacy  of  posts  and  telecommunica- 
tions, property,  or  the  right  of  asylum  in  order  to  combat  the 
free  democratic  basic  order,  shall  forfeit  these  basic  rights." 
Article  18  was  employed  twice  in  the  1950s  to  ban  political  par- 
ties of  the  extreme  right  and  left.  Article  18  is  seen  as  an  essen- 
tial component  of  a  wehrhafte  Demokratie — a  democracy  that  can 
defend  itself,  unlike  the  Weimar  Republic. 


348 


Government  and  Politics 


Article  20  states  that  "the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  is  a 
democratic  and  social  federal  state."  The  word  "social"  has 
been  commonly  interpreted  to  mean  that  the  state  has  the 
responsibility  to  provide  for  the  basic  social  welfare  of  its  citi- 
zens. The  Basic  Law,  however,  does  not  enumerate  specific 
social  duties  of  the  state.  Further,  according  to  Article  20,  "All 
state  authority  emanates  from  the  people.  It  shall  be  exercised 
by  the  people  by  means  of  elections  and  voting  and  by  specific 
legislative,  executive,  and  judicial  organs." 

Most  of  the  Basic  Law's  146  articles  describe  the  composition 
and  functions  of  various  organs  of  government,  as  well  as  the 
intricate  system  of  checks  and  balances  governing  their  interac- 
tion. Other  major  issues  addressed  in  the  Basic  Law  include  the 
distribution  of  power  between  the  federal  government  and  the 
state  (Land;  pi.,  Lander)  governments,  the  administration  of 
federal  laws,  government  finance,  and  government  administra- 
tion under  emergency  conditions.  The  Basic  Law  is  virtually 
silent  on  economic  matters;  only  Article  14  guarantees  "prop- 
erty and  the  right  of  inheritance"  and  states  that  "expropria- 
tion shall  be  permitted  only  in  the  public  weal." 

Any  amendment  to  the  Basic  Law  must  receive  the  support 
of  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  members  in  both  federal  legislative 
chambers — the  Bundestag  (Federal  Diet  or  lower  house)  and 
the  Bundesrat  (Federal  Council  or  upper  house).  Certain  pro- 
visions of  the  Basic  Law  cannot  be  amended:  those  relating  to 
the  essential  structures  of  federalism;  the  division  of  powers; 
the  principles  of  democracy,  social  welfare,  and  fundamental 
rights;  and  the  principle  of  state  power  based  on  law.  Of  the 
many  amendments  to  the  Basic  Law,  among  the  most  notable 
are  the  "defense  addenda"  of  1954-56,  which  regulate  the  con- 
stitutional position  of  the  armed  forces,  and  the  "Emergency 
Constitution"  of  1968,  which  delineates  wider  executive  powers 
in  the  case  of  an  internal  or  external  emergency. 

Federalism 

Germany  has  a  strong  tradition  of  regional  government  dat- 
ing back  to  the  founding  of  the  German  Empire  in  1871.  Since 
unification  in  1990,  the  Federal  Republic  has  consisted  of  six- 
teen Lander,  the  ten  Lander  of  the  former  West  Germany,  the 
five  new  Lander  of  the  former  East  Germany,  and  Berlin.  (How- 
ever, Berlin  and  the  eastern  Land  of  Brandenburg  are  slated  to 
merge  in  either  1999  or  2002.)  The  Land  governments  are 
based  on  a  parliamentary  system.  Most  Lander  have  unicameral 


349 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

legislatures,  whose  members  are  elected  directly  by  popular 
vote.  The  party  or  coalition  of  parties  in  control  of  the  legisla- 
ture chooses  a  minister  president  to  lead  the  Land  government. 
The  minister  president  selects  a  cabinet  to  run  Land  agencies 
and  carry  out  the  executive  functions  of  the  Land  government. 
Minister  presidents  are  highly  visible  national  figures  and  often 
progress  to  federal  office,  either  the  chancellorship  or  a  posi- 
tion in  the  federal  cabinet. 

The  Basic  Law  divides  authority  between  the  federal  govern- 
ment and  the  Lander,  with  the  general  principle  governing  rela- 
tions articulated  in  Article  30:  "The  exercise  of  governmental 
powers  and  the  discharge  of  governmental  functions  shall  be 
incumbent  on  the  Lander  insofar  as  this  Basic  Law  does  not 
otherwise  prescribe  or  permit."  Thus,  the  federal  government 
can  exercise  authority  only  in  those  areas  specified  in  the  Basic 
Law.  The  federal  government  is  assigned  a  greater  legislative 
role  and  the  Land  governments  a  greater  administrative  role. 
The  fact  that  more  civil  servants  are  employed  by  Land  govern- 
ments than  by  federal  and  local  governments  combined  illus- 
trates the  central  administrative  function  of  the  Lander. 

The  Basic  Law  divides  the  federal  government's  legislative 
responsibilities  into  exclusive  powers  (Articles  71  and  73),  con- 
current powers  (Articles  72,  74,  and  74a),  and  framework  pow- 
ers (Article  75).  The  exclusive  legislative  jurisdiction  of  the 
federal  government  extends  to  defense,  foreign  affairs,  immi- 
gration, transportation,  communications,  and  currency  stan- 
dards. The  federal  and  Land  governments  share  concurrent 
powers  in  several  areas,  including  civil  law,  refugee  and  expel- 
lee matters,  public  welfare,  land  management,  consumer  pro- 
tection, public  health,  and  the  collection  of  vital  statistics  (data 
on  births,  deaths,  and  marriages) .  In  the  areas  of  mass  media, 
nature  conservation,  regional  planning,  and  public  service  reg- 
ulations, framework  legislation  limits  the  federal  government's 
role  to  offering  general  policy  guidelines,  which  the  Lander 
then  act  upon  by  means  of  detailed  legislation.  The  areas  of 
shared  responsibility  for  the  Lander  and  the  federal  govern- 
ment were  enlarged  by  an  amendment  to  the  Basic  Law  in  1969 
(Articles  91a  and  91b),  which  calls  for  joint  action  in  areas  of 
broad  social  concern  such  as  higher  education,  regional  eco- 
nomic development,  and  agricultural  reform. 

All  policy  areas  not  assigned  to  federal  jurisdiction  are  within 
the  legislative  purview  of  the  Lander.  These  areas  include  edu- 
cation, law  enforcement,  regulation  of  radio  and  television, 


350 


Government  and  Politics 


church  affairs,  and  cultural  activities.  The  Lander  retain  signifi- 
cant powers  of  taxation.  Most  federal  taxes  are  collected  by 
Land  officials. 

The  Land  governments  also  exercise  power  at  the  national 
level  through  the  Bundesrat,  which  is  made  up  of  representa- 
tives appointed  by  the  Land  governments.  In  this  way,  the 
Lander  affect  the  federal  legislative  process  (see  The  Legisla- 
ture, this  ch.).  Half  of  the  members  of  the  Federal  Convention, 
which  elects  a  federal  president,  are  Land  officials,  and  the 
Land  governments  also  take  part  in  the  selection  of  judges  for 
the  federal  courts. 

Government  Institutions 
The  President 

The  Basic  Law  creates  a  dual  executive  but  grants  most  exec- 
utive authority  to  the  federal  chancellor,  as  head  of  govern- 
ment, rather  than  to  the  president,  who  acts  as  head  of  state 
(see  fig.  13).  The  presidency  is  primarily  a  ceremonial  post, 
and  its  occupant  represents  the  Federal  Republic  in  interna- 
tional relations.  In  that  sphere,  the  president's  duties  include 
signing  treaties,  representing  Germany  abroad,  and  receiving 
foreign  dignitaries.  In  the  domestic  sphere,  the  president  has 
largely  ceremonial  functions.  Although  this  official  signs  legis- 
lation into  law,  grants  pardons,  and  appoints  federal  judges, 
federal  civil  servants,  and  military  officers,  each  of  these 
actions  requires  the  countersignature  of  the  chancellor  or  the 
relevant  cabinet  minister.  The  president  formally  proposes  to 
the  Bundestag  a  chancellor  candidate  and  formally  appoints 
the  chancellor's  cabinet  members,  but  the  president  follows 
the  choice  of  the  Bundestag  in  the  first  case  and  of  the  chancel- 
lor in  the  second.  If  the  government  loses  a  simple  no-confi- 
dence vote,  the  president  dissolves  the  Bundestag,  but  here, 
too,  the  Basic  Law  limits  the  president's  ability  to  act  indepen- 
dently. In  the  event  of  a  national  crisis,  the  emergency  law 
reforms  of  1968  designate  the  president  as  a  mediator  who  can 
declare  a  state  of  emergency. 

There  is  disagreement  about  whether  the  president,  in  fact, 
has  greater  powers  than  the  above  description  would  suggest. 
Some  argue  that  nothing  in  the  Basic  Law  suggests  that  a  presi- 
dent must  follow  government  directives.  For  instance,  the  pres- 
ident could  refuse  to  sign  legislation,  thus  vetoing  it,  or  refuse 
to  approve  certain  cabinet  appointments.  As  of  mid-1995,  no

president  had  ever  taken  such  action,  and  thus  the  constitu- 
tionality of  these  points  had  never  been  tested. 

The  president  is  selected  by  secret  ballot  at  a  Federal  Con- 
vention that  includes  all  Bundestag  members  and  an  equal 
number  of  delegates  chosen  by  the  Land  legislatures.  This 
assemblage,  which  totals  more  than  1,000  people,  is  convened 
every  five  years.  It  may  select  a  president  for  a  second,  but  not  a 
third,  five-year  term.  The  authors  of  the  Basic  Law  preferred 
this  indirect  form  of  presidential  election  because  they 


352 


Government  and  Politics 


believed  it  would  produce  a  head  of  state  who  was  widely 
acceptable  and  insulated  from  popular  pressure.  Candidates 
for  the  presidency  must  be  at  least  forty  years  old. 

The  Basic  Law  did  not  create  an  office  of  vice  president.  If 
the  president  is  outside  the  country  or  if  the  position  is  vacant, 
the  president  of  the  Bundesrat  fills  in  as  the  temporary  head  of 
state.  If  the  president  dies  in  office,  a  successor  is  elected  within 
thirty  days. 

Usually  one  of  the  senior  leaders  of  the  largest  party  in  the 
Bundestag,  the  president  nonetheless  is  expected  to  be  non- 
partisan after  assuming  office.  For  example,  President  Richard 
von  Weizsacker,  whose  second  term  expired  in  June  1994,  was 
the  former  Christian  Democratic  mayor  of  Berlin.  Upon 
becoming  president  in  1984,  he  resigned  from  his  party  posi- 
tions. Weizsacker  played  a  prominent  role  in  urging  Germans 
to  come  to  terms  with  their  actions  during  the  Third  Reich  and 
in  calling  for  greater  tolerance  toward  foreigners  in  Germany 
as  right-wing  violence  escalated  in  the  early  1990s.  Although 
the  formal  powers  of  the  president  are  limited,  the  president's 
role  can  be  quite  significant  depending  on  his  or  her  own  activ- 
ities. Between  1949  and  1994,  the  Christian  Democratic  Union 
(Christlich  Demokratische  Union — CDU)  held  the  office  for 
twenty-five  years,  the  Free  Democratic  Party  (Freie  Demo- 
kratische Partei — FDP)  for  fifteen,  and  the  Social  Democratic 
Party  of  Germany  (Sozialdemokratische  Partei  Deutschlands — 
SPD)  for  five  (see  table  2,  Appendix). 

Elected  by  the  Federal  Convention  in  May  1994,  Roman  Her- 
zog  succeeded  Weizsacker  as  President  on  July  1,  1994.  Previ- 
ously president  of  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court  in  Karls- 
ruhe, Germany's  highest  court,  he  was  nominated  for  the  presi- 
dency by  the  CDU  and  its  sister  party,  the  Christian  Social 
Union  (Christlich-Soziale  Union — CSU). 

The  Chancellor  and  the  Cabinet 

The  federal  government  consists  of  the  chancellor  and  his 
or  her  cabinet  ministers.  As  explained  above,  the  Basic  Law 
invests  the  chancellor  with  central  executive  authority.  For  that 
reason,  some  observers  refer  to  the  German  political  system  as 
a  "chancellor  democracy."  The  chancellor's  authority  emanates 
from  the  provisions  of  the  Basic  Law  and  from  his  or  her  status 
as  leader  of  the  party  or  coalition  of  parties  holding  a  majority 
of  seats  in  the  Bundestag.  Every  four  years,  after  national  elec- 
tions and  the  seating  of  the  newly  elected  Bundestag  members, 


353 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  federal  president  nominates  a  chancellor  candidate  to  that 
parliamentary  body;  the  chancellor  is  elected  by  majority  vote 
in  the  Bundestag. 

The  Basic  Law  limits  parliament's  control  over  the  chancel- 
lor and  the  cabinet.  Unlike  most  parliamentary  legislatures, 
the  Bundestag  cannot  remove  the  chancellor  simply  with  a  vote 
of  no-confidence.  In  the  Weimar  Republic,  this  procedure  was 
abused  by  parties  of  both  political  extremes  in  order  to  oppose 
chancellors  and  undermine  the  democratic  process.  As  a  con- 
sequence, the  Basic  Law  allows  only  for  a  "constructive  vote  of 
no-confidence."  That  is,  the  Bundestag  can  remove  a  chancel- 
lor only  when  it  simultaneously  agrees  on  a  successor.  This  leg- 
islative mechanism  ensures  both  an  orderly  transfer  of  power 
and  an  initial  parliamentary  majority  in  support  of  the  new 
chancellor.  The  constructive  no-confidence  vote  makes  it 
harder  to  remove  a  chancellor  because  opponents  of  the  chan- 
cellor not  only  must  disagree  with  his  or  her  governing  but  also 
must  agree  on  a  replacement. 

As  of  1995,  the  Bundestag  had  tried  to  pass  a  constructive 
no-confidence  vote  twice,  but  had  succeeded  only  once.  In 
1972  the  opposition  parties  tried  to  replace  Chancellor  Willy 
Brandt  of  the  SPD  with  the  CDU  party  leader  because  of  pro- 
found disagreements  over  the  government's  policies  toward 
Eastern  Europe.  The  motion  fell  one  vote  shy  of  the  necessary 
majority.  In  late  1982,  the  CDU  convinced  the  FDP  to  leave  its 
coalition  with  the  SPD  over  differences  on  economic  policy 
and  to  form  a  new  government  with  the  CDU  and  the  CSU. 
The  constructive  no-confidence  vote  resulted  in  the  replace- 
ment of  Chancellor  Helmut  Schmidt  with  Helmut  Kohl,  the 
CDU  party  leader.  Observers  agree  that  the  constructive  no- 
confidence  vote  has  increased  political  stability  in  Germany. 

The  chancellor  also  may  make  use  of  a  second  type  of  no- 
confidence  vote  to  garner  legislative  support  in  the  Bundestag. 
The  chancellor  can  append  a  simple  no-confidence  provision 
to  any  government  legislative  proposal.  If  the  Bundestag  rejects 
the  proposal,  the  chancellor  may  request  that  the  president  dis- 
solve parliament  and  call  new  elections.  Although  not  com- 
monly used,  this  procedure  enables  the  chancellor  to  gauge 
support  in  the  Bundestag  for  the  government  and  to  increase 
pressure  on  the  Bundestag  to  vote  in  favor  of  legislation  that 
the  government  considers  as  critical.  Furthermore,  govern- 
ments have  employed  this  simple  no-confidence  motion  as  a 
means  of  bringing  about  early  Bundestag  elections.  For  exam-

pie,  after  Kohl  became  chancellor  through  the  constructive  no- 
confidence  vote  in  August  1982,  his  government  purposely  set 
out  to  lose  a  simple  no-confidence  provision  in  order  to  bring 
about  new  elections  and  give  voters  a  chance  to  validate  the 
new  government  through  a  democratic  election. 

Article  65  of  the  Basic  Law  sets  forth  three  principles  that 
define  how  the  executive  branch  functions.  First,  the  "chancel- 
lor principle"  makes  the  chancellor  responsible  for  all  govern- 
ment policies.  Any  formal  policy  guidelines  issued  by  the 
chancellor  are  legally  binding  directives  that  cabinet  ministers 
must  implement.  Cabinet  ministers  are  expected  to  introduce 
specific  policies  at  the  ministerial  level  that  reflect  the  chancel- 
lor's broader  guidelines.  Second,  the  "principle  of  ministerial 
autonomy"  entrusts  each  minister  with  the  freedom  to  super- 
vise departmental  operations  and  prepare  legislative  proposals 
without  cabinet  interference  so  long  as  the  minister's  policies 
are  consistent  with  the  chancellor's  larger  guidelines.  Third, 
the  "cabinet  principle"  calls  for  disagreements  between  federal 
ministers  over  jurisdictional  or  budgetary  matters  to  be  settled 
by  the  cabinet. 

The  chancellor  determines  the  composition  of  the  cabinet. 
The  federal  president  formally  appoints  and  dismisses  cabinet 
ministers,  at  the  recommendation  of  the  chancellor:  no 


355 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Bundestag  approval  is  needed.  According  to  the  Basic  Law,  the 
chancellor  may  set  the  number  of  cabinet  ministers  and  dictate 
their  specific  duties.  Chancellor  Ludwig  Erhard  had  the  largest 
cabinet,  with  twenty-two  ministers,  in  the  mid-1960s.  Kohl  pre- 
sided over  seventeen  ministers  at  the  start  of  his  fourth  term  in 
1994. 

The  power  of  the  smaller  coalition  partners,  the  FDP  and 
the  CSU,  was  evident  from  the  distribution  of  cabinet  posts  in 
Kohl's  government  in  1995.  The  FDP  held  three  ministries — 
the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Justice,  and  Ministry 
for  Economics.  CSU  members  led  four  ministries — the  Minis- 
try of  Finance,  Ministry  for  Health,  Ministry  for  Post  and  Tele- 
communications, and  Ministry  for  Economic  Cooperation. 

The  staff  of  a  cabinet  minister  is  managed  by  at  least  two 
state  secretaries,  both  of  whom  are  career  civil  servants  respon- 
sible for  the  ministry's  administration,  and  a  parliamentary 
state  secretary,  who  is  generally  a  member  of  the  Bundestag 
and  represents  the  ministry  there  and  in  other  political 
forums.  Typically,  state  secretaries  remain  in  the  ministry 
beyond  the  tenure  of  any  one  government,  in  contrast  to  the 
parliamentary  state  secretary,  who  is  a  political  appointee  and 
is  viewed  as  a  junior  member  of  the  government  whose  term 
ends  with  the  minister's.  Under  these  top  officials,  the  minis- 
tries are  organized  functionally  in  accordance  with  each  one's 
specific  responsibilities.  Career  civil  servants  constitute  virtually 
the  entire  staff  of  the  ministries. 

The  Legislature 

The  heart  of  any  parliamentary  system  of  government  is  the 
legislature.  Germany  has  a  bicameral  parliament.  The  two 
chambers  are  the  Bundestag  (Federal  Diet  or  lower  house)  and 
the  Bundesrat  (Federal  Council  or  upper  house).  Both  cham- 
bers can  initiate  legislation,  and  most  bills  must  be  approved  by 
both  chambers,  as  well  as  the  executive  branch,  before  becom- 
ing law.  Legislation  on  issues  within  the  exclusive  jurisdiction 
of  the  federal  government,  such  as  international  treaties,  does 
not  require  Bundesrat  approval. 

The  federal  government  introduces  most  legislation;  when  it 
does  so,  the  Bundesrat  reviews  the  bill  and  then  passes  it  on  to 
the  Bundestag.  If  a  bill  originates  in  the  Bundesrat,  it  is  submit- 
ted to  the  Bundestag  through  the  executive  branch.  If  the 
Bundestag  introduces  a  bill,  it  is  sent  first  to  the  Bundesrat  and, 
if  approved  there,  forwarded  to  the  executive.  The  Joint  Con-

chancellor,  1982-

ference  Committee  resolves  any  differences  over  legislation 
between  the  two  legislative  chambers.  Once  the  compromise 
bill  that  emerges  from  the  conference  committee  has  been 
approved  by  a  majority  in  both  chambers  and  by  the  cabinet,  it 
is  signed  into  law  by  the  federal  president  and  countersigned 
by  the  relevant  cabinet  minister. 

Bundestag 

The  Bundestag  is  the  principal  legislative  chamber,  roughly 
analogous  to  the  United  States  House  of  Representatives.  The 
Bundestag  has  grown  gradually  since  its  creation,  most  dramat- 
ically with  unification  and  the  addition  of  144  new  representa- 
tives from  eastern  Germany,  for  a  total  of  656  deputies  in  1990. 
A  further  expansion  in  1994  increased  the  number  to  672. 
Elections  are  held  every  four  years  (or  earlier  if  a  government 
falls  from  power).  Bundestag  members  are  the  only  federal 
officials  directly  elected  by  the  public.  All  candidates  must  be  at 
least  twenty-one  years  old;  there  are  no  term  limits. 

The  most  important  organizational  structures  within  the 
Bundestag  are  parliamentary  groups  (Fraktionen;  sing.,  Frak- 
tion),  which  are  formed  by  each  political  party  represented  in 
the  chamber.  The  size  of  a  party's  Fraktion  determines  the 
extent  of  its  representation  on  legislative  committees,  the  num- 
ber of  committee  chairs  it  can  hold,  and  its  representation  in 


357 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

executive  bodies  of  the  Bundestag.  The  head  of  the  largest 
Fraktion  is  named  president  of  the  Bundestag.  The  Fraktionen, 
not  the  members,  receive  the  bulk  of  government  funding  for 
legislative  and  administrative  activities. 

The  leadership  of  each  Fraktion  consists  of  a  parliamentary 
party  leader,  several  deputy  leaders,  and  an  executive  commit- 
tee. The  leadership's  major  responsibilities  are  to  represent  the 
Fraktion,  enforce  party  discipline,  and  orchestrate  the  party's 
parliamentary  activities.  The  members  of  each  Fraktion  are  dis- 
tributed among  working  groups  focused  on  specific  policy- 
related  topics  such  as  social  policy,  economics,  and  foreign  pol- 
icy. The  Fraktion  meets  once  a  week  to  consider  legislation 
before  the  Bundestag  and  formulate  the  party's  position  on  it. 

The  Bundestag's  executive  bodies  include  the  Council  of 
Elders  and  the  Presidium.  The  council  consists  of  the  Bundes- 
tag leadership,  together  with  the  most  senior  representatives  of 
each  Fraktion,  with  the  number  of  these  representatives  tied  to 
the  strength  of  the  party  in  the  chamber.  The  council  is  the 
coordination  hub,  determining  the  daily  legislative  agenda  and 
assigning  committee  chairpersons  based  on  party  representa- 
tion. The  council  also  serves  as  an  important  forum  for  inter- 
party  negotiations  on  specific  legislation  and  procedural  issues. 
The  Presidium  is  responsible  for  the  routine  administration  of 
the  Bundestag,  including  its  clerical  and  research  activities.  It 
consists  of  the  chamber's  president  and  vice  presidents  (one 
from  each  Fraktion) . 

Most  of  the  legislative  work  in  the  Bundestag  is  the  product 
of  standing  committees.  Although  this  is  common  practice  in 
the  United  States  Congress,  it  is  uncommon  in  other  parlia- 
mentary systems,  such  as  the  British  House  of  Commons  and 
the  French  National  Assembly  The  number  of  committees 
approximates  the  number  of  federal  ministries,  and  the  titles 
of  each  are  roughly  similar  (e.g.,  defense,  agriculture,  and 
labor).  Between  1987  and  1990,  the  term  of  the  eleventh 
Bundestag,  there  were  twenty-one  standing  committees.  The 
distribution  of  committee  chairs  and  the  membership  of  each 
committee  reflect  the  relative  strength  of  the  various  parties  in 
the  chamber.  In  the  eleventh  Bundestag,  the  CDU/CSU 
chaired  eleven  committees,  the  SPD  eight,  the  FDP  one,  and 
the  environmentalist  party,  the  Greens  (Die  Grunen),  one. 
Unlike  in  the  United  States  Congress,  where  all  committees  are 
chaired  by  members  of  the  majority  party,  the  German  system 
allows  members  of  the  opposition  party  to  chair  a  significant 


358 


Government  and  Politics 


number  of  standing  committees.  These  committees  have  either 
a  small  staff  or  no  staff  at  all. 

Although  most  legislation  is  initiated  by  the  executive 
branch,  the  Bundestag  considers  the  legislative  function  its 
most  important  responsibility.  The  Bundestag  concentrates 
much  of  its  energy  on  assessing  and  amending  the  govern- 
ment's legislative  program.  The  committees  play  a  prominent 
role  in  this  process.  Plenary  sessions  provide  a  forum  for  mem- 
bers to  engage  in  public  debate  on  legislative  issues  before 
them,  but  they  tend  to  be  well  attended  only  when  significant 
legislation  is  being  considered.  The  Bundestag  allots  each  Frak- 
tion  a  certain  amount  of  time,  based  on  its  size,  to  express  its 
views. 

Other  responsibilities  of  the  Bundestag  include  selecting  the 
federal  chancellor  and  exercising  oversight  of  the  executive 
branch  on  issues  of  both  substantive  policy  and  routine  admin- 
istration. This  check  on  executive  power  can  be  employed 
through  binding  legislation,  public  debates  on  government 
policy,  investigations,  and  direct  questioning  of  the  chancellor 
or  cabinet  officials.  For  example,  the  Bundestag  can  conduct  a 
question  hour  (Fragestunde) ,  in  which  a  government  represen- 
tative responds  to  a  previously  submitted  written  question  from 
a  member.  Members  can  ask  related  questions  during  the  ques- 
tion hour.  The  questions  can  concern  anything  from  a  major 
policy  issue  to  a  specific  constituent's  problem.  Use  of  the  ques- 
tion hour  has  increased  markedly  over  the  past  forty  years,  with 
more  than  20,000  questions  being  posed  during  the  1987-90 
Bundestag  term.  Understandably,  the  opposition  parties  are 
active  in  exercising  the  parliamentary  right  to  scrutinize  gov- 
ernment actions. 

One  striking  difference  when  comparing  the  Bundestag  with 
the  United  States  Congress  is  the  lack  of  time  spent  on  serving 
constituents  in  Germany.  In  part,  that  difference  results  from 
the  fact  that  only  50  percent  of  Bundestag  deputies  are  directly 
elected  to  represent  a  specific  geographic  district;  the  other 
half  are  elected  as  party  representatives.  The  political  parties 
are  thus  of  great  importance  in  Germany's  electoral  system, 
and  many  voters  tend  not  to  see  the  candidates  as  autonomous 
political  personalities  but  rather  as  creatures  of  the  party.  Inter- 
estingly, constituent  service  seems  not  to  be  perceived,  either 
by  the  electorate  or  by  the  representatives,  as  a  critical  function 
of  the  legislator.  A  practical  constraint  on  the  expansion  of 


359 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

constituent  service  is  the  limited  personal  staff  of  Bundestag 
deputies. 

Bundesrat 

The  second  legislative  chamber,  the  Bundesrat,  is  the  federal 
body  in  which  the  sixteen  Land  governments  are  directly  repre- 
sented. It  exemplifies  Germany's  federalist  system  of  govern- 
ment. Members  of  the  Bundesrat  are  not  popularly  elected  but 
are  appointed  by  their  respective  Land  governments.  Members 
tend  to  be  Land  government  ministers.  The  Bundesrat  has 
sixty-nine  members.  The  Lander  with  more  than  7  million 
inhabitants  have  six  seats  (Baden-Wurttemberg,  Bavaria,  Lower 
Saxony,  and  North  Rhine-Westphalia).  The  LdndervAth  popula- 
tions of  between  2  million  and  7  million  have  four  seats  (Ber- 
lin, Brandenburg,  Hesse,  Mecklenburg-Western  Pomerania, 
Rhineland-Palatinate,  Saxony,  Saxony-Anhalt,  Schleswig-Hol- 
stein,  and  Thuringia).  The  least  populous  Lander,  with  fewer 
than  2  million  inhabitants,  receive  three  seats  each  (Bremen, 
Hamburg,  and  the  Saarland).  This  system  of  representation, 
although  designed  to  reflect  Land  populations  accurately,  in 
fact  affords  greater  representation  per  inhabitant  to  the 
smaller  Lander.  The  presidency  of  the  Bundesrat  rotates  annu- 
ally among  the  Lander.  By  law,  each  Land  delegation  is  required 
to  vote  as  a  bloc  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  of  the 
Land  government. 

Because  the  Bundesrat  is  so  much  smaller  than  the  Bundes- 
tag, it  does  not  require  the  extensive  organizational  structure 
of  the  lower  house.  The  Bundesrat  typically  schedules  plenary 
sessions  once  a  month  for  the  purpose  of  voting  on  legislation 
prepared  in  committee.  In  comparison,  the  Bundestag  con- 
ducts about  fifty  plenary  sessions  a  year.  Bundesrat  representa- 
tives rarely  attend  committee  sessions;  instead,  they  delegate 
that  responsibility  to  civil  servants  from  their  ministries,  as 
allowed  for  in  the  Basic  Law.  The  members  tend  to  spend  most 
of  their  time  in  their  Land  capitals,  rather  than  in  the  federal 
capital. 

The  legislative  authority  of  the  Bundesrat  is  subordinate  to 
that  of  the  Bundestag,  but  the  upper  house  nonetheless  plays  a 
vital  legislative  role.  The  federal  government  must  present  all 
legislative  initiatives  first  to  the  Bundesrat;  only  thereafter  can  a 
proposal  be  passed  to  the  Bundestag.  Further,  the  Bundesrat 
must  approve  all  legislation  affecting  policy  areas  for  which  the 
Basic  Law  grants  the  Lander  concurrent  powers  and  for  which

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  Lander  must  administer  federal  regulations.  The  Bundesrat 
has  increased  its  legislative  responsibilities  over  time  by  success- 
fully arguing  for  a  broad,  rather  than  a  narrow,  interpretation 
of  what  constitutes  the  range  of  legislation  affecting  Land  inter- 
ests. In  1949  only  10  percent  of  all  federal  laws,  namely,  those 
directly  affecting  the  Lander,  required  Bundesrat  approval.  In 
1993  close  to  60  percent  of  federal  legislation  required  the 
upper  house's  assent.  The  Basic  Law  also  provides  the  Bundes- 
rat with  an  absolute  veto  of  such  legislation. 

The  political  power  of  the  absolute  veto  is  particularly  evi- 
dent when  the  opposition  party  or  parties  in  the  Bundestag 
have  a  majority  in  the  Bundesrat.  When  this  is  the  case,  the 
opposition  can  threaten  the  government's  legislative  program. 
Such  a  division  of  authority  can  complicate  the  process  of  gov- 
erning when  the  major  parties  disagree,  and,  unlike  the 
Bundestag,  the  Bundesrat  cannot  be  dissolved  under  any  cir- 
cumstances. 

This  bicameral  system  also  has  advantages.  Some  observers 
emphasize  that  different  majorities  in  the  two  chambers  ensure 
that  all  legislation,  when  approved,  has  the  support  of  a  broad 
political  spectrum — a  particularly  valuable  attribute  in  the 
aftermath  of  unification,  when  consensus  on  critical  policy 
decisions  is  vital.  The  formal  representation  of  the  Lander  in 
the  federal  government  through  the  upper  chamber  provides 
an  obvious  forum  for  the  coordination  of  policy  between  the 
Lander  and  the  federal  government.  The  need  for  such  coordi- 
nation, particularly  given  the  specific,  crucial  needs  of  the  east- 
ern Lander,  has  become  only  more  important. 

The  Judiciary 

The  judiciary's  independence  and  extensive  responsibilities 
reflect  the  importance  of  the  rule  of  law  in  the  German  system 
of  government.  A  core  concept  is  that  of  the  Rechtsstaat,  a  gov- 
ernment based  on  law,  in  which  citizens  are  guaranteed  equal- 
ity and  in  which  government  decisions  can  be  amended. 
Federal  law  delineates  the  structure  of  the  judiciary,  but  the 
administration  of  most  courts  is  regulated  by  Land  law.  The 
Lander  are  responsible  for  the  lower  levels  of  the  court  system; 
the  highest  appellate  courts  alone  operate  at  the  federal  level. 
This  federal-Land  division  of  labor  allows  the  federation  to 
ensure  that  laws  are  enforced  equally  throughout  the  country, 
whereas  the  central  role  of  the  Lander  in  administering  the 


362 


Government  and  Politics 


courts  safeguards  the  independence  of  the  judicial  system  from 
the  federal  government. 

Principles  of  Roman  law  form  the  basis  of  the  German  judi- 
cial system  and  define  a  system  of  justice  that  differs  fundamen- 
tally from  the  Anglo-Saxon  system.  In  the  United  States,  courts 
rely  on  precedents  from  prior  cases;  in  Germany,  courts  look  to 
a  comprehensive  system  of  legal  codes.  The  codes  delineate 
somewhat  abstract  legal  principles,  and  judges  must  decide  spe- 
cific cases  on  the  basis  of  those  standards.  Given  the  impor- 
tance of  complex  legal  codes,  judges  must  be  particularly  well 
trained.  Indeed,  judges  are  not  chosen  from  the  field  of  prac- 
ticing lawyers.  Rather,  they  follow  a  distinct  career  path.  At  the 
end  of  their  legal  education  at  university,  law  students  must 
pass  a  state  examination  before  they  can  continue  on  to  an 
apprenticeship  that  provides  them  with  broad  training  in  the 
legal  profession  over  several  years.  They  then  must  pass  a  sec- 
ond state  examination  that  qualifies  them  to  practice  law.  At 
that  point,  the  individual  can  choose  either  to  be  a  lawyer  or  to 
enter  the  judiciary.  Judicial  candidates  must  train  for  several 
more  years  before  actually  earning  the  title  of  judge. 

The  judicial  system  comprises  three  types  of  courts.  Ordi- 
nary courts,  dealing  with  criminal  and  most  civil  cases,  are  the 
most  numerous  by  far.  Specialized  courts  hear  cases  related  to 
administrative,  labor,  social,  fiscal,  and  patent  law.  Constitu- 
tional courts  focus  on  judicial  review  and  constitutional  inter- 
pretation. The  Federal  Constitutional  Court  (Bundes- 
verfassungsgericht)  is  the  highest  court  and  has  played  a  vital 
role  through  its  interpretative  rulings  on  the  Basic  Law. 

The  ordinary  courts  are  organized  in  four  tiers,  each  of 
increasing  importance.  At  the  lowest  level  are  several  hundred 
local  courts  (Amtsgerichte;  sing.,  Amstgericht) ,  which  hear  cases 
involving  minor  criminal  offenses  or  small  civil  suits.  These 
courts  also  carry  out  routine  legal  functions,  such  as  probate. 
Some  local  courts  are  staffed  by  two  or  more  professional 
judges,  but  most  have  only  one  judge,  who  is  assisted  by  lay 
judges  in  criminal  cases.  Above  the  local  courts  are  more  than 
100  regional  courts  (Landesgerichte;  sing.,  Landesgericht) ,  which 
are  divided  into  two  sections,  one  for  major  civil  cases  and  the 
other  for  criminal  cases.  The  two  sections  consist  of  panels  of 
judges  who  specialize  in  particular  types  of  cases.  Regional 
courts  function  as  courts  of  appeals  for  decisions  from  the  local 
courts  and  hold  original  jurisdiction  in  most  major  civil  and 
criminal  matters.  At  the  next  level,  Land  appellate  courts  ( Ober- 


363 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

landesgerichte;  sing.,  Oberlandesgericht)  primarily  review  points  of 
law  raised  in  appeals  from  the  lower  courts.  (For  cases  originat- 
ing in  local  courts,  this  is  the  level  of  final  appeal.)  Appellate 
courts  also  hold  original  jurisdiction  in  cases  of  treason  and 
anticonstitutional  activity.  Similar  to  the  regional  courts,  appel- 
late courts  are  divided  into  panels  of  judges,  arranged  accord- 
ing to  legal  specialization.  Crowning  the  system  of  ordinary 
courts  is  the  Federal  Court  of  Justice  (Bundesgerichtshof)  in 
Karlsruhe.  It  represents  the  final  court  of  appeals  for  all  cases 
originating  in  the  regional  and  appellate  courts  and  holds  no 
original  jurisdiction. 

Specialized  courts  deal  with  five  distinct  subject  areas: 
administrative,  labor,  social,  fiscal,  and  patent  law.  Like  the 
ordinary  courts,  they  are  organized  hierarchically  with  the 
Land  court  systems  under  a  federal  appeals  court.  Administra- 
tive courts  consist  of  local  administrative  courts,  higher  admin- 
istrative courts,  and  the  Federal  Administrative  Court.  In  these 
courts,  individuals  can  seek  compensation  from  the  govern- 
ment for  any  harm  caused  by  incorrect  administrative  actions 
by  officials.  For  instance,  many  lawsuits  have  been  brought  in 
administrative  courts  by  citizens  against  the  government  con- 
cerning the  location  and  safety  standards  of  nuclear  power 
plants.  Labor  courts  also  function  on  three  levels  and  address 
disputes  over  collective  bargaining  agreements  and  working 
conditions.  Social  courts,  organized  at  three  levels,  adjudicate 
cases  relating  to  the  system  of  social  insurance,  which  includes 
unemployment  compensation,  workers'  compensation,  and 
social  security  payments.  Finance,  or  fiscal,  courts  hear  only 
tax-related  cases  and  exist  on  two  levels.  Finally,  a  single  Fed- 
eral Patents  Court  in  Munich  adjudicates  disputes  relating  to 
industrial  property  rights. 

Except  for  Schleswig-Holstein,  each  Land  has  a  state  consti- 
tutional court.  These  courts  are  administratively  independent 
and  financially  autonomous  from  any  other  government  body. 
For  instance,  a  Land  constitutional  court  can  write  its  own  bud- 
get and  hire  or  fire  employees,  powers  that  represent  a  degree 
of  independence  unique  in  the  government  structure. 

Sixteen  judges  make  up  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court, 
Germany's  highest  and  most  important  judicial  body.  They  are 
selected  to  serve  twelve-year,  nonrenewable  terms  and  can  only 
be  removed  from  office  for  abuse  of  their  position  and  then 
only  by  a  motion  of  the  court  itself.  The  Bundestag  and  the 
Bundesrat  each  choose  half  of  the  court's  members.  Thus,  par- 


364 


Government  and  Politics 


tisan  politics  do  play  a  role.  However,  compromise  is  built  into 
the  system  because  any  court  decision  requires  a  two-thirds 
majority  among  the  participating  judges.  The  court  is  divided 
into  two  senates,  each  consisting  of  a  panel  of  eight  judges  with 
its  own  chief  justice.  The  first  senate  hears  cases  concerning 
the  basic  rights  guaranteed  in  Articles  1  through  19  of  the 
Basic  Law  and  concerning  judicial  review  of  legislation.  The 
second  senate  is  responsible  for  deciding  constitutional  dis- 
putes among  government  agencies  and  how  the  political  pro- 
cess should  be  regulated. 

Unlike  the  United  States  Supreme  Court,  the  Federal  Con- 
stitutional Court  does  not  hear  final  appeals — that  function 
belongs  to  the  Federal  Court  of  Justice.  The  Basic  Law  explic- 
itly confines  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Federal  Constitutional 
Court  to  constitutional  issues.  By  the  late  1980s,  the  majority  of 
the  articles  in  the  Basic  Law  had  been  subjected  to  judicial 
review,  and  the  constitutionality  of  federal  and  state  legislation 
had  been  considered  in  hundreds  of  court  cases.  When  lacking 
the  legislative  clout  to  challenge  a  government  policy,  the 
opposition  in  the  Bundestag  traditionally  has  turned  to  the 
Federal  Constitutional  Court  to  question  the  constitutionality 
of  legislation. 

The  Civil  Service 

As  of  June  1992,  about  6.7  million  Germans  were  employed 
by  federal,  Land,  or  local  governments  in  Germany;  close  to  5 
million  of  these  were  in  the  western  part  of  the  country,  and 
1.6  million  were  in  the  east.  The  vast  majority  (over  4.5  mil- 
lion) were  employed  at  the  Land  and  local  levels.  Included  at 
the  federal  level  were  roughly  642,000  postal  workers  and 
434,000  railroad  workers.  Of  these  civil  servants,  about  5.6  mil- 
lion were  working  full  time  and  1.1  million  part  time.  Public 
servants  have  considerable  social  status  in  Germany. 

Civil  servants  are  categorized  into  three  groups.  Slightly  over 
2  million  are  career  civil  servants  (Beamten;  sing.,  Beamte); 
about  3  million  are  employees  (Angestellten;  sing.,  Angestellte) ; 
and  roughly  1.5  million  are  workers  (Arbeiter).  Beamten  are 
divided  into  four  "career  groups":  higher  service,  executive  ser- 
vice, clerical  service,  and  basic  service.  A  public  servant  rarely 
moves  from  one  category  to  another  during  his  or  her  career. 

Beamten,  or  career  civil  servants,  constitute  the  highest  level 
of  the  administrative  elite  and  enjoy  special  privileges.  They  are 
appointed  for  life  and  also  receive  a  noncontributory  pension 


365 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

that  substantially  increases  their  salaries  in  comparison  with 
those  of  public  servants  in  other  categories.  Beamten  can  be 
found  everywhere,  from  low-level  jobs  in  the  post  office  to  the 
most  senior  positions  in  government  ministries,  the  equivalent 
of  supergrade  administrative  positions  in  the  United  States  gov- 
ernment. These  upper-level  Beamten  occupy  most  of  the  signifi- 
cant administrative  posts  within  the  bureaucracy  and  thus 
influence  both  formation  and  application  of  policy.  Almost  all 
Beamten  at  that  level  of  Land  and  federal  administration  have  a 
university  degree,  typically  with  a  concentration  in  law  or  eco- 
nomics. 

In  exercising  Land  authority,  Beamten  must  obey  the  orders 
of  their  superiors,  possess  no  right  to  strike,  are  bound  to 
defend  the  constitutional  order,  and  are  legally  responsible  for 
the  application  of  administrative  law.  In  1972  the  federal  and 
Land  governments  issued  an  executive  decree  that  institution- 
alized the  ban  against  employing  antidemocratic  extremists  in 
the  public  service.  This  highly  controversial  law  (known  as  the 
Radikalenerlass  or  Berufsverbot)  mandated  that  all  candidates 
for  positions  as  Beamten  be  screened  and  those  already 
employed  be  examined,  if  deemed  necessary,  for  evidence  of 
extreme  political  views.  Other  public  servants  may  also  be  scru- 
tinized "in  accordance  with  the  contracts  regulating  each  case." 

Public  servants  may  run  for  public  office,  and  many  do  so. 
For  example,  the  Bundestag  is  often  referred  to  as  the  parlia- 
ment of  civil  servants  because  a  high  percentage  of  its  mem- 
bers are  Beamten.  During  the  twelfth  Bundestag  (1990-94), 
almost  one-third  of  the  deputies  were  Beamten  The  largest  por- 
tion of  that  group,  10  percent,  consisted  of  teachers. 

Land  and  Local  Government 

The  Basic  Law  stipulates  that  the  structure  of  Land  govern- 
ment must  "conform  to  the  principles  of  republican,  demo- 
cratic, and  social  government  based  on  the  rule  of  law"  (Article 
28  [1] ).  Twelve  of  the  Lander  are  governed  by  a  cabinet  led  by  a 
minister  president  together  with  a  unicameral  legislative  body, 
the  Landtag  (pi.,  Landtage).  The  relationship  between  the  leg- 
islative and  executive  branches  mirrors  that  in  the  federal  sys- 
tem: the  legislatures  are  popularly  elected,  typically  for  four 
years,  and  the  minister  president  is  chosen  by  a  majority  vote 
among  Landtag  members.  The  minister  president  appoints  a 
cabinet  to  run  Land  agencies  and  carry  out  the  executive 
duties  of  the  Land  government.  Bavaria  is  the  only  Land  with  a

Germany:  A  Country  Study 


bicameral  legislature;  the  Landtag  is  popularly  elected,  but  the 
second  chamber,  the  Senate,  consists  of  representatives  of  the 
major  social  and  economic  groups  in  Bavaria.  In  the  city  Lander 
of  Berlin,  Bremen,  and  Hamburg,  the  executive  branch  con- 
sists of  a  popularly  elected  senate.  The  senates'  members  carry 
out  duties  equivalent  to  those  of  the  ministers  in  the  larger 
Lander.  The  senate  chooses  a  senate  president  in  Bremen  and  a 
mayor  in  Berlin  and  Hamburg  to  serve  as  chief  executive.  Land 
cabinets  consist  of  about  ten  ministers;  the  most  important  is 
the  minister  of  the  interior,  who  directs  the  internal  adminis- 
tration of  the  Land  and  commands  the  police. 

Politics  at  the  Land  level  often  carry  implications  for  federal 
politics.  Opposition  victories  in  Landtag  elections — which  take 
place  throughout  the  federal  government's  four-year  term — 
can  weaken  the  federal  government  coalition.  This  was  the  case 
for  the  fall  from  the  chancellorship  of  Konrad  Adenauer  in 
1963  and  that  of  Willy  Brandt  in  1974.  The  Land  elections  are 
also  viewed  as  a  barometer  of  support  for  the  policies  of  the 
federal  government.  If  the  parties  of  the  governing  coalition 
lose  support  in  successive  Land  elections,  those  results  may 
foreshadow  difficulties  for  the  federal  government.  The  out- 
come of  Land  elections  also  directly  affects  the  composition  of 
the  Bundesrat.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  opposition  SPD  com- 
manded a  two-thirds  majority  in  that  legislative  chamber,  which 
made  it  particularly  difficult  for  the  CDU/CSU-FDP  govern- 
ment to  achieve  the  constitutional  changes  it  sought. 

Three  levels  of  government  are  subordinate  to  the  adminis- 
trative authority  of  the  states.  First,  the  largest  Lander  are 
divided  into  districts.  These  districts  decentralize  Land  adminis- 
tration and  are  run  by  district  presidents  who  are  appointed  by 
the  Land  minister  president  and  report  to  the  Land  minister  of 
the  interior. 

Second,  each  Land  is  divided  into  Landkreis  (pi.,  Landkreise) 
governments,  each  consisting  of  an  elected  council  and  an 
executive,  who  is  selected  by  the  council  and  whose  duties  are 
comparable  to  those  of  a  county  manager  supervising  local  gov- 
ernment administration.  The  Landkreise  have  primary  adminis- 
trative functions  in  specific  areas,  such  as  highways,  hospitals, 
and  public  utilities. 

Third,  some  Landkreise  are  divided  further  into  Gemeinden 
(sing.,  Gemeinde),  or  municipal  government  authorities.  Gemein- 
den consist  of  elected  councils  and  an  executive,  the  mayor, 
who  is  chosen  by  the  council.  In  some  small  municipalities,  the 


368 


Government  and  Politics 


mayor  is  popularly  elected.  Gemeinden  have  two  major  policy 
responsibilities.  First,  they  administer  programs  authorized  by 
the  federal  or  Land  government.  Such  programs  typically 
might  relate  to  youth,  public  health,  and  social  assistance.  Sec- 
ond, Article  28(2)  of  the  Basic  Law  guarantees  Gemeinden  "the 
right  to  regulate  on  their  own  responsibility  all  the  affairs  of 
the  local  community  within  the  limits  set  by  law."  Under  this 
broad  statement  of  competence,  local  governments  can  justify 
a  wide  range  of  activities.  For  instance,  many  municipalities 
develop  the  economic  infrastructure  of  their  communities 
through  the  development  of  industrial  parks.  Local  authorities 
foster  cultural  activities  by  supporting  local  artists  and  building 
arts  centers.  Local  government  also  provides  basic  public  utili- 
ties, such  as  gas  and  electricity,  as  well  as  public  transportation. 
To  increase  administrative  efficiency,  West  Germany  consoli- 
dated the  Gemeinden,  reducing  the  total  number  from  roughly 
25,000  in  the  late  1960s  to  about  8,500  by  the  early  1990s.  With 
unification,  however,  the  number  of  Gemeinden  for  all  sixteen 
Lander  rose  to  about  16,000  because  of  the  large  number 
(more  than  7,500)  of  small  Gemeindenm  former  East  Germany. 

The  Electoral  System 

The  Basic  Law  guarantees  the  right  to  vote  by  secret  ballot  in 
direct  and  free  elections  to  every  German  citizen  eighteen 
years  of  age  or  older.  To  be  eligible  to  vote,  an  individual  must 
have  resided  in  a  constituency  district  for  at  least  three  months 
prior  to  an  election.  Officials  who  are  popularly  elected 
include  Bundestag  deputies  at  the  federal  level,  Landtag  repre- 
sentatives or  senate  members  at  the  Land  level,  and  council 
members  at  the  district  and  local  levels.  Executive  officials  typi- 
cally are  not  chosen  in  popular,  direct  elections;  however,  in  a 
minority  of  municipalities  the  mayor  is  elected  by  popular  vote. 
Elections  usually  are  held  every  four  years  at  all  levels.  Elec- 
tions at  the  federal,  Land,  and  local  levels  are  not  held  simulta- 
neously, as  in  the  United  States,  but  rather  are  staggered.  As  a 
result,  electoral  campaigns  are  almost  always  under  way,  and 
each  election  is  viewed  as  a  test  of  the  federal  government's 
popularity  and  the  strength  of  the  opposition.  All  elections  are 
held  on  Sunday. 

Voter  turnout,  traditionally  high — around  90  percent  for 
national  elections — has  been  decreasing  since  the  early  1980s. 
Voters  are  most  likely  to  participate  in  general  elections,  but 
even  at  that  level  turnout  in  western  Germany  fell  from  89.1 


369 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

percent  in  1983  to  84.3  percent  in  1987,  and  to  78.5  percent  in 
1990.  The  1990  general  election  was  the  first  following  unifica- 
tion; turnout  was  the  lowest  since  the  first  West  German  elec- 
tion in  1949.  The  most  consistent  participants  in  the  electoral 
process  are  civil  servants,  and  a  clear  correlation  exists  between 
willingness  to  vote  and  increasing  social  and  professional  status 
and  income.  Analysts  had  been  predicting  a  further  drop  in 
turnout,  the  result  of  increasing  voter  alienation,  for  the 
national  election  in  October  1994;  in  fact,  turnout  increased 
slightly  to  79.1  percent. 

In  designing  the  electoral  system,  the  framers  of  the  Basic 
Law  had  two  objectives.  First,  they  sought  to  reestablish  the  sys- 
tem of  proportional  representation  used  during  the  Weimar 
Republic.  A  proportional  representation  system  distributes  leg- 
islative seats  based  on  a  party's  percentage  of  the  popular  vote. 
For  example,  if  a  party  wins  15  percent  of  the  popular  vote,  it 
receives  15  percent  of  the  seats  in  the  Bundestag.  The  second 
objective  was  to  construct  a  system  of  single-member  districts, 
like  those  in  the  United  States.  The  framers  believed  that  this 
combination  would  create  an  electoral  system  that  would  not 
fragment  as  the  Weimar  Republic  had  and  would  ensure 
greater  accountability  of  representatives  to  their  electoral  dis- 
tricts. A  hybrid  electoral  system  of  personalized  proportional 
representation  resulted. 

Under  the  German  electoral  system,  each  voter  casts  two  bal- 
lots in  a  Bundestag  election.  The  elector's  first  vote  is  cast  for  a 
candidate  running  to  represent  a  particular  district.  The  candi- 
date who  receives  a  plurality  of  votes  becomes  the  district  rep- 
resentative. Germany  is  divided  into  328  electoral  districts  with 
roughly  180,000  voters  in  each  district.  Half  of  the  Bundestag 
members  are  directly  elected  from  these  districts.  The  second 
ballot  is  cast  for  a  particular  political  party.  These  second  votes 
determine  each  party's  share  of  the  popular  vote. 

The  first  ballot  is  designed  to  decrease  the  anonymity  of  a 
strict  proportional  representation  system — thus  the  description 
"personalized" — but  it  is  the  second  ballot  that  determines  how 
many  Bundestag  seats  each  party  will  receive.  To  ensure  that 
each  party's  percentage  of  the  combined  district  (first  ballot) 
and  party  (second  ballot)  seats  equals  its  share  of  the  second 
vote,  each  party  is  allocated  additional  seats.  These  additional 
party  seats  are  filled  according  to  lists  of  candidates  drawn  up 
by  the  state  party  organization  prior  to  the  election.  Research 
indicates  that  constituency  representatives  in  the  Bundestag

are  more  responsive  to  their  electorate's  needs  and  are  slightly 
more  likely  to  follow  their  constituents'  preferences  when  vot- 
ing than  deputies  chosen  from  the  party  lists. 

If  a  party  wins  more  constituency  seats  than  it  is  entitled  to 
according  to  its  share  of  the  vote  in  the  second  ballot,  the  party 
retains  those  seats,  and  the  size  of  the  Bundestag  is  increased. 
This  was  the  case  in  both  the  1990  and  1994  federal  elections. 
After  the  1990  election,  the  total  number  of  seats  in  the 
Bundestag  rose  from  656  to  662.  In  1994  sixteen  extra  seats 
were  added,  leading  to  a  672-member  Bundestag;  twelve  of 
those  seats  went  to  Kohl's  CDU  and  accounted  for  Kohl's  ten- 
seat  margin  of  victory. 

One  crucial  exception  to  Germany's  system  of  personalized 
proportional  representation  is  the  so-called  5  percent  clause. 
The  electoral  law  stipulates  that  a  party  must  receive  a  mini- 
mum of  5  percent  of  the  national  vote,  or  three  constituency 


371 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

seats,  in  order  to  get  any  representation  in  the  Bundestag.  An 
exception  was  made  for  the  first  all-Germany  election  in 
December  1990,  with  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court  setting 
separate  5  percent  minimums  for  the  old  and  new  Lander. 
Thus,  a  party  needed  only  to  win  5  percent  of  the  vote  in  either 
western  or  eastern  Germany  in  order  to  receive  seats  in  the 
Bundestag. 

The  5  percent  clause  was  crafted  to  prevent  the  proliferation 
of  small  extremist  parties  like  those  that  destabilized  the 
Weimar  Republic.  This  electoral  hurdle  has  limited  the  success 
of  minor  parties  and  consolidated  the  party  system.  Often  vot- 
ers are  reluctant  to  vote  for  a  smaller  party  if  they  are  unsure  if 
it  will  clear  the  5  percent  threshold.  Smaller  parties,  such  as  the 
FDP,  encourage  voters  to  split  their  ticket,  casting  their  first  bal- 
lot for  a  named  candidate  of  one  of  the  larger  parties  and  their 
second  ballot  for  the  FDP. 

Small  parties  rarely  win  the  three  constituency  seats  that 
automatically  qualify  a  party  for  parliamentary  representation 
according  to  its  overall  share  of  the  national  vote.  This  rarity 
occurred  in  the  1994  national  election.  The  Party  of  Demo- 
cratic Socialism  (Partei  des  Demokratischen  Sozialismus — 
PDS),  the  renamed  communist  party  of  the  former  East  Ger- 
many, won  4.4  percent  of  the  national  vote,  an  insufficient  total 
to  clear  the  5  percent  hurdle.  The  PDS  surprised  seemingly 
everyone,  however,  by  winning  four  districts  outright  (all  in 
eastern  Berlin),  entitling  it  to  thirty  seats  in  the  Bundestag. 

Germany  holds  no  by-elections;  if  Bundestag  deputies  resign 
or  die  in  office,  they  are  automatically  succeeded  by  the  next 
candidate  on  the  party's  list  in  the  appropriate  Land.  There  are 
also  no  primary  elections  through  which  voters  can  choose 
party  representatives.  Rather,  a  small  group  of  official  party 
members  nominates  constituency  candidates,  and  candidates 
appearing  on  the  Land  party  lists  are  chosen  at  Land  party  con- 
ventions held  six  to  eight  weeks  before  the  election.  Party  offi- 
cials at  the  federal  level  play  no  part  in  the  nominating 
procedure.  Roughly  two-thirds  of  the  candidates  run  as  both 
constituent  and  list  candidates,  thus  increasing  their  chances  of 
winning  a  legislative  seat.  If  a  candidate  wins  in  a  constituency, 
his  or  her  name  is  automatically  removed  from  the  Land  list. 
There  is  considerable  jockeying  among  party  factions  and  vari- 
ous interest  groups  as  candidates  are  selected  and  placed  on 
the  Land  lists.  Placement  near  the  top  of  the  list  is  usually  given 
to  incumbents,  party  members  of  particular  political  promi- 


372 


Government  and  Politics 


nence,  or  members  who  have  the  support  of  a  key  faction  or 
interest  group.  Thus,  aspiring  politicians  are  quite  dependent 
on  their  party,  and  successful  candidates  tend  to  evince  loyalty 
to  the  party's  policy  platform.  Candidates  must  be  at  least 
twenty-one  years  old. 

Political  Parties 

Observers  often  describe  political  parties  as  critical  stabiliz- 
ing institutions  in  democratic  systems  of  government.  Because 
of  the  central  role  played  by  German  political  parties,  many 
observers  refer  to  Germany  as  a  "party  state."  The  government 
of  this  type  of  state  rests  on  the  principle  that  competition 
among  parties  provides  for  both  popular  representation  and 
political  accountability  for  government  action. 

On  the  role  of  parties,  Article  21  of  the  Basic  Law  stipulates 
that  "the  political  parties  shall  participate  in  the  forming  of  the 
political  will  of  the  people.  They  may  be  freely  established. 
Their  internal  organization  must  conform  to  democratic  prin- 
ciples. They  must  publicly  account  for  the  sources  of  their 
funds."  The  1967  Law  on  Parties  further  solidified  the  role  of 
parties  in  the  political  process  and  addressed  party  organiza- 
tion, membership  rights,  and  specific  procedures,  such  as  the 
nomination  of  candidates  for  office. 

The  educational  function  noted  in  Article  21  ("forming  of 
the  political  will")  suggests  that  parties  should  help  define  pub- 
lic opinion  rather  than  simply  carry  out  the  wishes  of  the  elec- 
torate. Major  parties  are  closely  affiliated  with  large 
foundations,  which  are  technically  independent  of  individual 
party  organizations.  These  foundations  receive  over  90  percent 
of  their  funding  from  public  sources  to  carry  out  their  educa- 
tional role.  They  offer  public  education  programs  for  youth 
and  adults,  research  social  and  political  issues,  and  facilitate 
international  exchanges. 

Party  funding  comes  from  membership  dues,  corporate  and 
interest  group  gifts,  and,  since  1959,  public  funds.  Figures  on 
party  financing  from  1992  show  that  dues  accounted  for  over 
50  percent  of  SPD  revenues  and  42  percent  of  CDU  revenues. 
Federal  resources  accounted  for  24  percent  of  SPD  revenues 
and  30  percent  of  CDU  revenues;  donations  accounted  for  8 
percent  and  17  percent,  respectively.  The  parties  must  report 
all  income,  expenditures,  and  assets.  The  government  substan- 
tially finances  election  campaigns.  Any  party  that  gains  at  least 
0.5  percent  of  the  national  vote  is  eligible  to  receive  a  set  sum. 


373 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

This  sum  has  increased  over  time  and,  beginning  in  January 
1984,  amounted  to  DM5  (for  value  of  the  deutsche  mark — see 
Glossary)  from  the  federal  treasury  for  every  vote  cast  for  a  par- 
ticular party  in  a  Bundestag  election.  Parties  at  the  Land  level 
receive  similar  public  subsidies.  The  political  parties  receive 
free  campaign  advertising  on  public  television  and  radio  sta- 
tions for  European,  national,  and  Land  elections.  Airtime  is 
allotted  to  parties  proportionally  based  on  past  election  perfor- 
mance. Parties  may  not  purchase  additional  time. 

Several  events,  including  a  party-financing  scandal  in  the 
early  1980s  and  an  electoral  campaign  in  Schleswig-Holstein 
marked  by  dirty  tricks  in  the  late  1980s,  have  contributed  to 
increased  public  distrust  of  the  parties.  A  1990  poll  showed  that 
West  Germans,  in  ranking  the  level  of  confidence  they  had  in  a 
dozen  social  and  political  institutions,  placed  political  parties 
very  low  on  the  list. 

Although  only  3  to  4  percent  of  voters  were  members  of  a 
political  party,  all  the  major  parties  experienced  a  decrease  in 
party  membership  in  the  early  1990s,  possibly  a  result  of  the 
increased  distrust  of  political  parties.  SPD  membership  fell  by 
3.5  percent  in  1992  to  888,000.  At  the  end  of  the  1970s,  the 
party  had  had  more  than  1  million  members.  CDU  member- 
ship fell  by  5  percent  in  1992  to  714,000,  while  that  of  the  FDP 
fell  by  about  one-fifth  to  110,000. 

Article  21  of  the  Basic  Law  places  certain  restrictions  on  the 
ideological  orientation  of  political  parties:  "Parties  which,  by 
reason  of  their  aims  or  the  behavior  of  their  adherents,  seek  to 
impair  or  abolish  the  free  democratic  basic  order  or  to  endan- 
ger the  existence  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany,  shall  be 
unconstitutional.  The  Federal  Constitutional  Court  shall 
decide  on  the  question  of  unconstitutionality."  This  provision 
allowed  for  the  banning  of  the  neo-Nazi  Socialist  Reich  Party  in 
1952  and  the  Communist  Party  of  Germany  (Kommunistische 
Partei  Deutschlands— KPD)  in  1956. 

The  decision  to  regulate  the  organization  and  activities  of 
political  parties  reflects  lessons  learned  from  Germany's  expe- 
rience during  the  post-World  War  I  Weimar  Republic,  when  a 
weak  multiparty  system  severely  impaired  the  functioning  of 
parliamentary  democracy  and  was  effectively  manipulated  by 
antidemocratic  parties.  After  World  War  II,  many  parties  dotted 
the  West  German  political  landscape,  but  electoral  laws  allowed 
only  parties  with  at  least  5  percent  of  the  vote  to  have  represen- 
tation in  national  and  Land  parliaments.  Over  time,  the  smaller 


374 


Government  and  Politics 


parties  faded  from  the  scene.  From  1962  to  1982,  the  Bundes- 
tag contained  representatives  from  only  four  parties:  the  CDU, 
the  CSU,  the  SPD,  and  the  FDP  (see  table  4,  Appendix).  The 
Greens  gained  enough  of  the  national  vote  to  win  seats  in  1983, 
and  unification  brought  additional  parties  into  the  Bundestag 
in  late  1990.  At  the  federal  level,  the  CSU  coalesces  with  the 
CDU,  the  largest  conservative  party.  The  SPD  is  the  major  party 
of  the  left.  The  liberal  FDP  is,  typically,  the  critical  swing  party, 
which  can  form  a  coalition  with  either  the  CDU/CSU  or  the 
SPD  to  create  the  majority  needed  to  pass  legislation  in  the 
Bundestag. 

Christian  Democratic  Union/Christian  Social  Union 

Following  World  War  II,  the  Christian  Democratic  Union 
(Christlich  Demokratische  Union — CDU)  was  founded  by  a 
diverse  group  of  Catholics  and  Protestants,  businesspeople  and 
trade  unionists,  and  conservatives  and  moderates.  The  party 
espoused  a  Christian  approach  to  politics  and  rejected  both 
Nazism  and  communism.  CDU  members  advocated  conserva- 
tive values  and  the  benefits  of  a  social  market  economy — that 
is,  one  combining  capitalist  practices  and  an  extensive  welfare 
system.  Konrad  Adenauer,  the  CDU's  first  leader  and  West  Ger- 
many's first  chancellor,  envisioned  the  CDU  as  a  conservative 
catchall  party  ( Volkspartei)  that  would  attract  a  majority  of  the 
electorate. 

The  CDU  is  a  national  party  except  in  the  Land  of  Bavaria, 
where  it  is  not  active,  in  deference  to  its  sister  party,  the  Chris- 
tian Social  Union  (Christlich-Soziale  Union — CSU).  Bavaria 
has  the  largest  concentration  of  conservative,  rural,  Catholic 
voters,  and  the  CSU  has  dominated  politics  there  since  1957. 
The  CSU  was  personified  by  its  leader,  Franz-Josef  Strauss,  until 
his  death  in  1988.  By  1994  no  clear  heir  to  Strauss  had 
emerged,  but  the  CSU  nonetheless  retained  its  absolute  major- 
ity in  the  Land  election  of  September  1994  (see  table  21, 
Appendix).  Germany's  population  increased  through  unifica- 
tion, and  thus  it  has  become  more  difficult  for  the  CSU  to  pass 
the  5  percent  electoral  threshold  at  the  national  level.  How- 
ever, the  CSU  performed  strongly  in  the  1994  national  elec- 
tion, garnering  7.3  percent  of  the  vote.  The  CDU  and  the  CSU 
form  a  single  Fraktion  in  parliament,  choose  a  common  candi- 
date for  chancellor,  and  have  always  governed  in  coalition. 
Below  the  federal  level,  the  two  party  organizations  are  entirely 
separate. 


375 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

From  1949  until  1963,  Adenauer  and  his  CDU  dominated 
German  politics  (see  West  Germany  and  the  Community  of 
Nations,  ch.  2).  At  the  time  of  the  1961  election,  Adenauer  was 
eighty-five  years  old,  and  the  opposition  SPD  was  gaining  in 
popularity.  Ludwig  Erhard,  a  CDU  member  credited  with  engi- 
neering Germany's  postwar  economic  miracle,  succeeded  Ade- 
nauer as  chancellor  in  1963  (see  table  3,  Appendix).  An 
economic  recession  then  hastened  the  end  of  the  CDU/CSU's 
hold  on  power.  November  1966  brought  the  creation  of  the 
Grand  Coalition  between  the  CDU/CSU  and  the  SPD  with 
Kurt  Georg  Kiesinger  (CDU)  as  chancellor  and  Willy  Brandt 
(SPD)  as  vice  chancellor  (see  Ludwig  Erhard  and  the  Grand 
Coalition,  ch.  2).  The  FDP  was  relegated  to  the  opposition 
benches.  After  the  1969  election,  the  SPD  formed  a  coalition 
with  the  FDP,  leaving  the  CDU/CSU  in  opposition  for  the  first 
time  in  West  German  history. 

For  thirteen  years,  the  CDU/CSU  waited  to  regain  power.  By 
the  early  1980s,  the  CDU  had  adopted  a  new  party  program 
consisting  of  conservative  economic  policies,  resembling  those 
of  Margaret  Thatcher  and  Ronald  Reagan,  and  moderate  social 
and  foreign  policies.  Helmut  Kohl,  as  leader  of  the  CDU/CSU 
Fraktion  in  the  Bundestag,  was  also  rebuilding  a  political  bridge 
to  the  FDP.  In  1982,  as  West  Germany's  economy  weakened, 
the  liberal  SPD  and  the  economically  conservative  FDP  could 
not  settle  on  a  package  of  economic  remedies.  The  FDP  chose 
to  leave  the  coalition  and  form  a  new  government  with  the 
CDU/CSU.  The  constructive  vote  of  no-confidence  was  used 
successfully  for  the  first  time  to  unseat  Helmut  Schmidt  as 
chancellor;  Kohl  replaced  him.  West  Germans  ratified  this 
change  through  early  elections  called  for  March  1983  (see  The 
Christian  Democratic/ Christian  Socialist-Free  Democratic  Coa- 
lition, 1983- ,  ch.  2). 

By  the  late  1980s,  the  CDU/CSU  was  growing  increasingly 
unpopular.  The  CDU/CSU  was  also  facing  a  new  challenge 
from  the  right  in  the  form  of  a  new  extreme  right  party,  the 
Republikaner.  In  a  series  of  Land  elections,  the  Republikaner 
successfully  eroded  some  of  the  CDU/CSU's  support.  The  col- 
lapse of  the  German  Democratic  Republic,  however,  provided 
Kohl  with  a  historic  opportunity  to  reverse  the  fortunes  of  his 
party.  While  most  Germans  reacted  to  the  change  in  the  geopo- 
litical landscape  with  amazement,  Kohl  seized  the  moment  and 
actively  advocated  early  unification  (see  Unification,  ch.  8). 
The  first,  free,  all-Germany  election  since  November  1932  took 


376 


Government  and  Politics 


place  in  December  1990.  In  essence,  this  election  became  a  ref- 
erendum on  the  process  of  unification;  the  CDU/CSU 
emerged  victorious,  with  Kohl  promising  greater  prosperity  for 
all  Germans.  As  the  costs  of  unification,  in  economic,  social, 
and  psychological  terms,  became  more  apparent  to  both  west- 
ern and  eastern  Germans,  the  CDU  began  suffering  setbacks  in 
Land  and  local  elections.  Nonetheless,  Chancellor  Kohl  was 
able  to  claim  a  narrow  victory  in  the  national  election  of  Octo- 
ber 1994.  Kohl's  governing  coalition  benefited  from  an  increas- 
ingly positive  economic  outlook  in  Germany  and  from  the  fact 
that  the  opposition  Social  Democratic  candidate,  Rudolf 
Scharping,  was  seen  by  many  as  lackluster  (see  Political  Devel- 
opments since  Unification,  this  ch.). 

The  organizational  structure  of  the  CDU  is  a  product  of  the 
parry's  evolution.  In  its  early  years,  the  CDU  was  a  loose  collec- 
tion of  local  groups.  Over  time,  a  weak  national  party  emerged 
to  complement  the  strong  Land  party  organizations.  In  the 
early  1970s,  the  CDU  built  up  its  national  organization  to  com- 
pete with  the  more  tightly  structured  SPD.  Membership  and 
party  income  increased  accordingly.  The  Federal  Executive  is 
the  primary  executive  organ  of  the  CDU.  It  consists  of  about 
sixty  individuals,  including  the  party  chair  (elected  for  two 
years),  several  deputy  chairs,  a  general  secretary,  a  treasurer, 
the  CDU's  main  legislative  representatives,  and  the  leaders  of 
the  Land  party  organizations.  Because  the  Federal  Executive  is 
too  large  and  does  not  meet  frequently,  a  smaller  subset  called 
the  Presidium,  composed  of  the  highest  ranking  CDU  officials, 
actually  sets  party  policy  and  makes  administrative  decisions. 
Each  Land  except  Bavaria,  where  the  CSU  is  active,  holds  semi- 
annual party  congresses  and  has  an  executive  committee. 
These  party  structures  are  primarily  responsible  for  the  selec- 
tion of  party  candidates  for  Bundestag  elections.  Every  two 
years,  the  CDU  holds  a  full  party  congress  of  several  hundred 
party  activists.  Kohl  has  served  as  national  chairman  of  the 
CDU  since  1973,  headed  the  parliamentary  Fraktion  from  1976 
until  1982,  and  continues  to  lead  the  party  as  chancellor.  Kohl's 
single-handed  management  of  the  party  has  given  him  a  politi- 
cal dominance  within  the  CDU  that  only  Adenauer  surpassed. 

The  CDU  maintains  several  auxiliary  organizations  designed 
to  increase  the  party's  attractiveness  to  particular  societal 
groups  and  to  represent  their  views  within  the  party.  CDU  stat- 
utes list  seven  organizations  representing  youth,  women,  work-

and  refugees.  Other,  unofficial  groupings  exist  as  well.  The 
most  powerful  of  the  auxiliary  organizations  has  traditionally 
been  the  one  representing  business  and  industry.  Although 
these  auxiliary  organizations  are  legally  autonomous  from  the 
CDU,  a  high  percentage  of  their  members  are  also  members  of 
theCDU. 

Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany 

Founded  in  1875,  the  Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany 
(Sozialdemokratische  Partei  Deutschlands — SPD)  is  Germany's 
oldest  political  party  and  its  largest  in  terms  of  membership. 
After  World  War  II,  under  the  leadership  of  Kurt  Schumacher, 
the  SPD  reestablished  itself  as  an  ideological  party,  represent- 
ing the  interests  of  the  working  class  and  the  trade  unions.  The 
party's  program,  which  espoused  Marxist  principles,  called  for 
the  nationalization  of  major  industries  and  state  planning.  A 
strong  nationalist,  Schumacher  rejected  Adenauer's  Western- 
oriented  foreign  policy  and  gave  priority  to  unifying  Germany, 
even  if  that  meant  accommodating  Soviet  demands.  Despite 
the  SPD's  membership  of  almost  1  million  in  1949,  it  was 
unable  to  dent  Adenauer's  popularity.  Schumacher's  death  in 
1952  and  a  string  of  electoral  defeats  led  the  SPD  to  rethink  its 
platform  in  order  to  attract  more  votes.  The  Bad  Godesburg 
Program,  a  radical  change  in  policy,  was  announced  at  the 
SPD's  1959  party  conference.  The  new  program  meant  aban- 
doning the  party's  socialist  economic  principles  and  adopting 
the  principles  of  the  social  market  economy.  The  party  also 
dropped  its  opposition  to  West  German  membership  in  the 
North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO — see  Glossary). 
Like  the  CDU,  the  SPD  was  becoming  a  catchall  party  ( Volks- 
partei) — albeit  of  the  left. 

Introduction  of  the  Bad  Godesberg  Program,  together  with 
the  emergence  of  a  dynamic  leader  in  the  person  of  Willy 
Brandt,  marked  the  beginning  of  improved  fortunes  for  the 
SPD.  Although  the  party  gained  support  from  election  to  elec- 
tion, suspicion  about  its  ability  to  govern  persisted.  Joining  the 
CDU/CSU  in  the  Grand  Coalition  in  November  1966  proved 
critical  in  erasing  doubts  among  voters  about  SPD  reliability. 
After  the  1969  election,  the  FDP  decided  to  form  a  coalition 
with  the  SPD — a  governing  configuration  that  held  until  1982 
(see  The  Social  Democratic-Free  Democratic  Coalition,  1969- 
82,  ch.  2).

Government  and  Politics 


Brandt  served  as  chancellor  from  1969  to  1974.  His  most 
notable  achievements  were  in  foreign  policy.  Brandt  and  his 
key  aide,  Egon  Bahr,  put  into  place  an  entirely  new  approach 
to  the  East — Ostpolitik — premised  upon  accepting  the  reality 
of  postwar  geopolitical  divisions  and  giving  priority  to  reconcil- 
iation with  Eastern  Europe.  Brandt  addressed  long-standing 
disputes  with  the  Soviet  Union  and  Poland,  signing  landmark 
treaties  with  both  countries  in  1970.  His  efforts  won  him  the 
Nobel  Prize  for  Peace  in  1971.  The  Brandt  government  also 
negotiated  the  Basic  Treaty  with  East  Germany  in  1972,  which 
formally  granted  recognition  to  the  GDR.  On  the  domestic 
side,  the  SPD-FDP  coalition  succeeded  in  almost  doubling 
social  spending  between  1969  and  1975. 

Helmut  Schmidt  succeeded  Brandt  as  chancellor  in  1974. 
Although  Schmidt  won  a  reputation  as  a  highly  effective  leader, 
the  SPD  experienced  increasingly  trying  times.  The  oil  crises  of 
the  1970s  undermined  economic  growth  globally,  and  West 
Germany  experienced  economic  stagnation  and  inflation.  A 
critical  problem  for  the  SPD-FDP  coalition  government  was  a 
difference  in  opinion  over  the  appropriate  response  to  these 
problems.  Divisions  over  economic  policy  were  exacerbated  by 
a  debate  within  the  party  over  defense  policy  and  the  stationing 
of  United  States  intermediate  nuclear  forces  in  West  Germany 
in  the  early  1980s.  In  1982  the  Free  Democrats  decided  to 
abandon  the  coalition  with  the  SPD  and  allied  themselves  with 
the  CDU/CSU,  forcing  the  SPD  out  of  power.  Schmidt, 
although  regarded  as  a  statesman  abroad  and  an  effective 
leader  at  home,  became  increasingly  isolated  within  his  own 
party,  and  he  chose  not  to  campaign  as  the  SPD  chancellor  can- 
didate in  the  March  1983  elections.  Hans-Jochen  Vogel  was  the 
SPD  standard-bearer  in  that  election,  and  the  party  suffered  a 
serious  loss. 

The  SPD  has  been  wrought  by  internal  crises  since  the  late 
1970s,  and  these  divisions  have  continued  into  the  1990s.  The 
party  is  split  into  two  factions,  one  giving  priority  to  economic 
and  social  justice,  egalitarianism,  and  environmental  protec- 
tion, and  the  other  most  concerned  with  controlling  inflation, 
encouraging  fiscal  responsibility,  and  playing  a  significant  part 
in  the  European  security  system.  The  SPD  faces  a  challenge  on 
the  left  from  the  Greens  and  on  the  right  from  the  CDU/CSU 
and  the  FDP.  Rather  than  move  to  the  left,  the  SPD  chose  a 
centrist  strategy  in  the  1987  national  election  and  earned  only 
a  small  increase  in  voter  support.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

In  1990  the  nomination  of  Oskar  Lafontaine  as  chancellor 
candidate  suggested  a  tactical  shift  to  the  left  aimed  at  attract- 
ing liberal,  middle-class  voters.  The  national  election  in 
December  1990  became,  in  essence,  a  referendum  on  unifica- 
tion, and  the  CDU's  Kohl,  who  had  endorsed  a  speedy  union, 
far  outstripped  the  more  ambivalent  and  pessimistic  Lafon- 
taine in  the  polls.  The  SPD  did  not  receive  the  support  it  had 
expected  in  the  heavily  Protestant  eastern  Lander.  Leadership 
of  the  SPD  passed  to  Bjorn  Engholm,  a  moderate,  who 
resigned  in  May  1993  in  the  wake  of  a  political  scandal. 

Rudolf  Scharping,  the  moderate  and  relatively  unknown 
minister  president  of  Rhineland-Palatinate,  was  elected  by  SPD 
members — the  first  time  in  the  history  of  the  party  that  its 
members  directly  chose  a  new  leader — to  replace  Engholm  in 
late  June  1993.  Scharping  opposed  Kohl  in  the  1994  national 
election.  The  SPD  candidate  began  1994  with  a  strong  lead  in 
public  opinion  polls,  but,  beginning  in  late  April,  the  SPD's 
support  began  a  sustained  decline  for  several  reasons.  For  one, 
the  increasingly  positive  economic  situation  was  credited  to  the 
governing  coalition.  For  another,  Scharping  was  perceived  by 
many  Germans  to  be  a  lackluster  candidate;  further,  he  was  not 
wholly  successful  in  portraying  himself  as  the  conciliator  who 
had  brought  harmony  to  a  traditionally  fractious  SPD.  Follow- 
ing the  election,  Scharping  became  the  leader  of  the  SPD's  par- 
liamentary group  in  the  Bundestag. 

The  organizational  structure  of  the  SPD  is  highly  central- 
ized, with  decisions  made  in  a  top-down,  bureaucratic  fashion. 
Technically,  the  SPD's  highest  authority  is  the  party  congress, 
which  meets  biannually.  Arguably,  its  only  significant  function 
is  to  elect  the  thirty-six-member  Executive  Committee,  which 
serves  as  the  SPD's  primary  executive  body  and  its  policy 
maker.  The  members  of  the  Executive  Committee  typically  rep- 
resent the  various  political  factions  within  the  party.  The  core 
of  the  Executive  Committee  is  the  nine-member  Presidium, 
which  represents  the  inner  circle  of  party  officials  and  is  gener- 
ally composed  of  the  party  leadership.  The  Presidium  meets 
weekly  to  conduct  the  business  of  the  party,  deal  with  budget- 
ary issues,  and  handle  administrative  and  campaign  matters. 
The  Presidium  is  also  responsible  for  endorsing  policy  originat- 
ing either  with  an  SPD  government  or  with  the  leadership  of 
the  parliamentary  Fraktion  when  the  party  is  in  opposition.  In 
almost  all  cases,  decisions  made  in  the  Presidium  are  ratified  by 
the  Federal  Executive  and  the  party  congress.  All  SPD  organiza- 


380 


Government  and  Politics 


tions  below  the  national  level  elect  their  own  party  officials. 
The  district,  subdistrict,  and  local  levels  are  all  subordinate  to 
the  Land  executive  committees,  which  direct  party  policy  below 
the  national  level  and  are  relatively  independent  of  the  federal 
party  officials.  Like  the  CDU/CSU,  the  SPD  maintains  special- 
ized groups  representing  particular  professions,  youth,  women, 
trade  unions,  refugees,  and  sports  interests.  In  the  case  of  the 
SPD,  these  groups  are  closely  tied  to  the  SPD  bureaucracy,  and 
only  the  Young  Socialists  and  the  trade  union  group  have  pol- 
icy-making roles. 

Free  Democratic  Party 

The  Free  Democratic  Party  (Freie  Demokratische  Partei — 
FDP)  is  much  smaller  than  the  CDU  or  SPD,  but  its  limited 
electoral  strength  masks  the  party's  inordinate  influence.  Prior 
to  the  1994  election,  the  FDP  had  experienced  its  worst  results 
in  national  elections  in  1969  (5.8  percent)  and  1983  (7  per- 
cent) .  Both  of  those  poor  showings  occurred  following  an  FDP 
decision  to  switch  coalition  partners.  Beyond  these  two  excep- 
tions, between  1949  and  1990  the  FDP  averaged  9.6  percent  of 
the  vote  in  national  elections.  Given  its  pivotal  role  in  govern- 
ing coalitions,  the  FDP  has  held  over  20  percent  of  the  cabinet 
posts  during  its  time  in  government. 

The  FDP  served  in  coalition  governments  with  the  CDU 
from  1949  to  1956  and  from  1961  to  1966.  As  of  mid-1995,  it 
has  governed  with  the  CDU  since  1982.  The  FDP  governed  in 
coalition  with  the  SPD  from  1969  to  1982.  The  remarkable 
amount  of  time  that  the  FDP  has  spent  in  government  has 
been  a  source  of  continuity  in  the  German  political  process. 
FDP  ministers  carry  a  detailed  knowledge  of  government  per- 
sonnel and  procedures  unsurpassed  among  the  other  parties. 

The  central  role  played  by  the  FDP  in  forming  governments 
is  explained  by  the  fact  that  a  major  party  has  been  able  to  gar- 
ner an  outright  majority  of  Bundestag  seats  only  once  (the 
CDU,  in  1957);  thus,  the  CDU  and  the  SPD  have  been  com- 
pelled to  form  coalition  governments.  Therefore,  the  FDP  has 
participated  in  every  government  except  the  one  from  1957  to 
1961  and  the  Grand  Coalition  of  1966-69.  Because  the  SPD 
and  CDU/CSU  enjoyed  roughly  equal  electoral  support,  the 
FDP  could  choose  with  which  major  party  it  wished  to  align. 
This  ability  to  make  or  break  a  ruling  coalition  has  provided 
the  small  FDP  with  considerable  leverage  in  the  distribution  of 
policy  and  cabinet  positions.  To  take  one  example,  as  of  mid- 


381 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

1995,  the  FDP,  in  the  person  of  Klaus  Kinkel,  led  the  Ministry 
of  Foreign  Affairs,  which  it  has  held  since  1969.  The  most 
prominent  member  of  the  FDP,  Hans-Dietrich  Genscher, 
served  as  foreign  minister  from  1974  until  his  resignation  in 
1992. 

The  FDP  was  created  in  1948  under  the  chairmanship  of 
Theodor  Heuss,  who  served  as  the  first  president  of  the  Federal 
Republic,  from  1949  to  1959.  The  party's  founders  wanted  the 
FDP  to  revive  the  liberal  party  tradition  of  pre-World  War  II 
Germany.  Although  there  was  some  initial  debate  over  what 
was  meant  by  "liberal,"  the  party  did  articulate  a  political  phi- 
losophy distinct  from  that  of  the  two  major  parties.  The  FDP 
gave  precedence  to  the  legal  protection  of  individual  free- 
doms. Unlike  the  SPD,  it  supported  private  enterprise  and  dis- 
avowed any  socialist  leaning,  and,  unlike  the  CDU/CSU,  it 
envisioned  a  strictly  secular  path  for  itself.  In  the  early  1990s, 
the  Free  Democrats  remained  closer  to  the  CDU/ CSU  on  eco- 
nomic issues  and  closer  to  the  SPD  on  social  and  foreign  policy. 
Many  Germans  view  the  FDP  as  the  party  of  the  middle,  moder- 
ating the  policies  of  both  major  parties. 

Following  the  1949  national  elections,  the  FDP  emerged  as  a 
natural  ally  of  the  CDU/CSU,  most  importantly  because  of  a 
congruity  of  economic  policy.  During  the  mid-  to  late  1960s, 
the  FDP,  under  the  leadership  of  Walter  Scheel,  went  through  a 
transformation  of  sorts,  shedding  its  conservative  image  and 
emphasizing  the  reformist  aspects  of  its  liberal  tradition.  Its 
new  focus  on  social  concerns  resulted  in  an  SPD-FDP  coalition 
in  1969.  The  party's  new  direction  was  ratified  at  the  FDP's 
1971  party  congress,  which  endorsed  a  program  of  "social  liber- 
alism." As  economic  conditions  worsened  in  the  early  1980s, 
however,  the  FDP  returned  to  its  earlier  advocacy  of  economic 
policies  more  conservative  than  those  endorsed  by  the  SPD. 
The  FDP  was  most  concerned  with  the  growing  budget  deficit, 
whereas  the  SPD  gave  priority  to  the  impact  of  the  economic 
downturn  on  workers.  The  FDP  abandoned  the  coalition  with 
the  SPD  in  September  1982,  shifting  allegiance  to  the  CDU/ 
CSU.  The  FDP  lost  considerable  electoral  support  in  the  1983 
federal  election  but  regained  strength  in  the  1987  election. 

The  Free  Democrats  benefited  initially  from  unification,  gar- 
nering 11  percent  of  the  vote  in  the  first  all-Germany  elections 
in  December  1990.  In  part,  the  FDP's  popularity  in  the  east  was 
directly  attributable  to  Genscher,  an  eastern  German  by  birth 


382 


Government  and  Politics 


who  played  a  leading  role  in  negotiations  over  the  interna- 
tional agreements  that  made  unification  possible. 

In  light  of  the  FDP's  strong  showing  in  the  1990  election,  it  is 
perhaps  surprising  to  note  that,  by  the  time  of  the  1994 
national  election,  the  FDP  was,  in  many  ways,  a  party  in  crisis.  It 
had  lost  representation  in  every  Land  that  held  elections  in 
1994,  and  thus  the  FDP  has  no  seats  in  any  eastern  Land  legisla- 
ture. Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Kinkel  had  been  elected  party 
chairman  in  1993,  and  some  critics  felt  that  the  two  posts  had 
overwhelmed  him,  leading  him  to  perform  inadequately  in 
both.  Other  observers,  however,  argued  that  it  was  the  party's 
message,  rather  than  its  messenger,  that  needed  revamping. 
Increasingly,  the  FDP  found  it  difficult  to  differentiate  its  policy 
from  that  of  Kohl's  CDU.  Given  the  fact  that  the  FDP  had  per- 
formed so  poorly  at  the  Land  level  in  1994,  there  was  much 
speculation  as  to  whether  the  party  would  cross  the  5  percent 
hurdle  in  the  national  election.  FDP  politicians  breathed  a  col- 
lective sigh  of  relief  when  the  party  garnered  6.9  percent  of  the 
vote  when  Germans  went  to  the  polls  in  October  1994.  Report- 
edly, the  FDP  had  over  500,000  CDU  voters  to  thank  for  this 
outcome,  because  they  gave  their  second  votes  tactically  to  the 
FDP  to  ensure  a  victory  for  Kohl.  One  poll  showed  that  63  per- 
cent of  those  who  voted  for  the  FDP  gave  the  CDU  as  their  pre- 
ferred party. 

The  structure  of  the  FDP  is  decentralized  and  is  loosely  orga- 
nized at  all  levels.  The  party  basically  is  a  federation  of  Land 
organizations,  each  maintaining  a  degree  of  well-guarded  inde- 
pendence. The  national  party  headquarters  lacks  the  power  to 
orchestrate  activities  at  the  Land  level,  and  the  formal  party 
institutions — the  Federal  Executive,  Presidium,  and  party  con- 
gress— are  weak.  The  FDP  deemed  this  lack  of  centralization 
necessary  to  accommodate  differences  within  the  party,  partic- 
ularly between  economic  conservatives  and  social  liberals.  The 
FDP  has  never  sought  to  be  a  mass  party,  and  its  members 
accordingly  have  little  influence  on  decision  making. 

The  Greens 

In  the  early  years  of  the  FRG,  several  minor  parties  repre- 
senting a  range  of  political  views  from  the  neo-Nazi  right  to  the 
communist  left  played  a  role  in  the  political  system.  Support 
for  these  parties  dwindled  over  time,  and,  after  1961,  the  FDP 
was  the  only  smaller  party  to  cross  the  5  percent  threshold  nec- 
essary to  gain  Bundestag  representation.  The  presence  of  the  5 


383 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

percent  clause  in  federal,  Land,  and  most  local  election  laws 
was  a  significant  reason  for  the  decline  of  minor  parties.  The 
major  parties  have  encouraged  this  trend  by  sponsoring  certain 
regulations — for  instance,  in  the  areas  of  federal  financing  for 
political  parties  and  procedures  for  nominating  party  candi- 
dates— that  have  also  made  it  more  difficult  for  minor  parties 
to  survive. 

A  challenge  to  West  Germany's  established  party  system 
emerged  in  1983  when  a  relatively  new  party,  the  Greens  (Die 
Grunen),  entered  the  Bundestag.  The  Green  movement  had 
been  gaining  support  steadily  since  the  late  1970s,  and  by  the 
end  of  1982  the  Greens  were  represented  in  six  of  West  Ger- 
many's eleven  Land  parliaments.  The  Greens'  platform  gave 
priority  to  environmental  concerns  and  an  end  to  the  use  of 
nuclear  energy  as  a  power  source.  The  party  also  opposed  the 
stationing  of  United  States  intermediate-range  nuclear  weap- 
ons in  Western  Europe.  On  the  basis  of  this  platform,  the 
Greens  won  5.6  percent  of  the  vote  in  the  1983  federal  elec- 
tion. The  success  of  the  Greens  at  the  federal  level — which  con- 
tinued in  the  1987  national  election  with  the  party  winning  8.3 
percent  of  the  vote — led  to  a  "greening"  of  the  established  par- 
ties, with  environmental  awareness  increasing  across  the  politi- 
cal spectrum.  The  Greens  also  livened  up  the  Bundestag, 
appearing  in  jeans  and  sweaters  rather  than  business  suits  and 
bringing  plants  into  proceedings. 

The  Greens  were  plagued  by  a  split  between  the  Realos  (real- 
ists) and  the  Fundis  (fundamentalists).  The  Realos  are  pragma- 
tists  who  want  to  serve  as  a  constructive  opposition  and 
ultimately  exercise  power.  The  more  radical  Fundis  are  com- 
mitted to  a  fundamental  restructuring  of  society  and  politics; 
they  do  not  want  to  share  power  with  the  Social  Democrats — 
their  obvious  allies — or  in  any  way  legitimate  the  existing  politi- 
cal system. 

The  Greens  did  not  embrace  the  unification  of  Germany 
and  opposed  any  automatic  extension  of  West  German  eco- 
nomic and  political  principles  to  the  east.  The  West  German 
Greens  chose  not  to  form  an  electoral  alliance  with  their  east- 
ern counterparts,  Alliance  90  (Bundnis  90),  prior  to  the  1990 
elections  because  of  their  opposition  to  union.  This  lack  of 
enthusiasm  for  unification  alienated  the  Greens  from  much  of 
their  own  constituency.  The  party's  chances  for  success  in  the 
December  1990  all-Germany  election  were  further  under- 
mined by  the  SPD's  choice  of  Lafontaine  as  its  candidate  for 


384 


Government  and  Politics 


chancellor.  Lafontaine  moved  the  SPD  to  the  left,  successfully 
co-opting  "green"  issues.  The  West  German  Greens  received 
only  4.8  percent  of  the  vote  in  the  1990  election,  an  outcome 
that  left  them  with  no  seats  in  the  Bundestag.  Alliance  90,  com- 
posed largely  of  former  dissidents  and  focusing  heavily  on  civil 
rights,  received  6  percent  of  the  eastern  vote  and  therefore 
received  eight  seats  in  the  Bundestag.  Had  these  two  parties 
run  in  coalition,  they  could  have  secured  about  forty  parlia- 
mentary seats.  Alliance  90  had  grown  out  of  the  major  human 
rights  groups  that  demonstrated  against  the  communist  system 
and  effectively  brought  down  the  Berlin  Wall  in  1989.  Like  the 
West  German  Greens,  Alliance  90  had  not  wanted  quick  unity 
with  the  west  either,  but  the  sentiment  of  the  majority  of  east- 
ern Germans  was  clear. 

Young  middle-class  voters  living  in  urban  areas  form  the  core 
of  support  for  the  West  German  Greens.  Alliance  90  also 
receives  much  of  its  support  from  this  group,  although  one- 
third  of  its  supporters  are  over  fifty  years  of  age.  Employees  of 
the  public  sector  are  disproportionately  strong  supporters  of 
both  parties.  Election  results  suggest  that  neither  working-class 
voters  nor  independent  businesspeople  are  likely  to  vote  for 
either  party. 

The  devastating  loss  for  the  West  German  Greens  in  the 
1990  election  brought  the  conflict  between  Realos  and  Fundis 
to  a  head,  with  the  pragmatic  wing  emerging  as  victor.  The 
party  conference  in  April  1991  ratified  a  set  of  Realo  reforms. 
In  the  series  of  Land  elections  that  followed  (Hesse,  Rhineland- 
Palatinate,  Hamburg,  and  Bremen),  the  Greens  did  well.  This 
trend  continued  in  1992  as  the  Greens  received  an  impressive 
9.5  percent  of  the  vote  in  the  wealthy,  southwestern  Land  of 
Baden-Wurttemberg.  In  the  rural,  northwestern  Land  of 
Schleswig-Holstein,  the  Greens  garnered  4.97  percent  of  the 
vote,  coming  within  397  votes  of  surpassing  the  5  percent  hur- 
dle. 

In  January  1993,  the  West  German  Greens  merged  with  Alli- 
ance 90  in  preparation  for  the  spate  of  federal  and  Land  elec- 
tions scheduled  for  1994.  The  new  party  is  listed  officially  as 
Alliance  90/Greens  (Bundnis  90/Die  Grunen),  but  members 
informally  call  it  the  Greens. 

Overall,  the  Greens  performed  well  in  the  series  of  Land 
elections  in  1994.  Following  the  1994  national  election,  with 
7.3  percent  of  the  vote,  the  Greens  emerged  as  the  third  stron- 
gest party  in  the  federal  parliament.  The  obvious  coalition  part-

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

ner  for  the  Greens  is  the  SPD,  though  one  increasingly  hears 
talk  of  possible  CDU/Green  coalitions.  Indeed,  the  Greens 
have  moderated  many  of  their  positions,  a  reflection  of  the 
dominance  in  the  party  of  the  Realos.  The  best  known  figure  in 
the  party  is  Joschka  Fischer,  a  prominent  Realo  and  a  former 
environment  minister  in  the  Land  of  Hesse. 

The  Republikaner  and  the  German  People's  Union 

On  the  opposite  end  of  the  political  spectrum  from  the 
Greens  are  two  parties  of  the  far  right,  the  Republikaner  (Die 
Republikaner — REP),  with  about  23,000  members,  and  the 
German  People's  Union  (Deutsche  Volksunion — DVU),  with 
26,000  members.  As  of  mid-  1995,  these  two  parties  had  not 
gained  sufficient  support  to  win  seats  in  the  Bundestag,  but  the 
DVU  was  represented  in  Land  parliaments  in  Bremen  (with  6.2 
percent  of  the  vote  in  1991)  and  Schleswig-Holstein  (with  6.3 
percent  of  the  vote  in  1992);  the  Republikaner  held  seats  in 
Baden-Wurttemberg  (with  10.9  percent  of  the  vote  in  1992). 
The  Republikaner  received  2.1  percent  of  the  vote  in  the  all- 
Germany  election  of  December  1990  and  1.9  percent  in  the 
October  1994  election. 

In  the  early  1990s,  the  rallying  cry  of  the  far  right  was  "Ger- 
many for  the  Germans."  This  slogan  appeals  to  many  Germans, 
particularly  young,  male,  rural,  less  educated,  blue-collar  work- 
ers who  fear  for  their  economic  future  and  regard  the  large 
pool  of  asylum-seekers  as  competitors  for  housing,  social  pro- 
grams, and  jobs.  These  particular  Germans  are  also  uneasy 
about  greater  integration  within  the  European  Union  (EU — 
see  Glossary),  which,  in  their  minds,  requires  Germany  to  for- 
feit too  much  of  its  identity  and  share  too  much  of  its  prosper- 
ity. According  to  some  observers,  the  far  right's  electoral 
support  represents,  in  part,  a  protest  vote  against  the  main- 
stream parties.  German  politicians  repeatedly  remark  on  the 
electorate's  Politikverdrossenheit — a  deep  disaffection  with  all 
things  political. 

Franz  Schonhuber,  a  one-time  Bavarian  television  moderator 
and  former  officer  in  the  Nazi  Waffen-SS,  formed  the  Republi- 
kaner in  1983  from  a  group  of  discontented  members  of  the 
CSU.  Schonhuber  published  a  book  in  1981  boasting  of  his 
experiences  in  the  Waffen-SS  but  has  staunchly  denied  that  his 
party  has  neo-Nazi  leanings.  Elected  to  the  European  Parlia- 
ment in  1989,  Schonhuber,  over  seventy  years  old  in  mid-1995, 
tried  to  portray  the  party  as  a  mainstream  group  that  does  not 


386 


Government  and  Politics 


promote  bigotry  but  merely  protects  German  national  inter- 
ests. The  party  platform  speaks  for  itself.  In  it,  the  Republi- 
kaner  blame  foreigners,  who  make  up  about  8  percent  of  the 
German  population,  for  the  housing  shortage,  street  crime, 
and  pollution.  Among  other  things,  the  party  has  proposed 
banning  Islamic  community  centers  from  sponsoring  political 
or  cultural  activities  other  than  prayer,  and  it  has  advocated 
putting  asylum-seekers  in  collection  camps  "to  minimize  the 
native  population's  existing  and  growing  antipathy  toward  for- 
eign residents."  The  party  platform  also  proposes  creating  sep- 
arate classes  for  foreign  schoolchildren,  and  it  rejects  "the 
multicultural  society  that  has  made  the  United  States  the 
world's  largest  showplace  of  crime  and  latent  racial  conflict." 
Reportedly,  the  Republikaner  attracted  about  5,000  new  mem- 
bers in  eastern  Germany  in  1992  and  1993.  Schonhuber  con- 
tends that  support  in  the  east  comes  from  young  Germans 
between  twenty  and  thirty  years  of  age,  whereas  in  the  west  sup- 
port comes  from  members  of  his  own  generation.  Schonhuber, 
the  party's  only  nationally  known  figure,  was  deposed  as  party 
leader  in  the  fall  of  1994  because  he  had  proposed  that  his 
party  join  forces  with  the  more  extreme  DVU. 

Gerhard  Frey,  the  Munich  publisher  of  two  weekly  neofascist 
newspapers,  Deutsche  National-Zeitung  (print  run  63,000)  and 
Deutsche  Wochen-Zeitung  (20,000),  founded  the  DVU  in  1971. 
The  DVU  espouses  many  of  the  views  held  by  the  Republi- 
kaner, but  it  goes  one  step  further  in  tacitly  supporting  vio- 
lence against  asylum-  seekers  and  foreign  workers.  Frey,  over 
sixty  years  old  in  mid-1995,  has  sought  to  distance  himself  from 
pro-Nazi  sentiments  while  simultaneously  insisting  that  most 
Germans  want  to  live  in  a  racially  pure  country. 

Germany's  domestic  intelligence  agency,  the  Federal  Office 
for  the  Protection  of  the  Constitution  (Bundesamt  fur  Verfas- 
sungsschutz — BfV),  announced  in  April  1992  that  the  DVU  was 
under  surveillance  to  determine  if  the  party  met  the  legal  defi- 
nition of  "antidemocratic,"  a  classification  that  would  permit 
the  government  to  ban  it.  A  similar  investigation  of  the  Repub- 
likaner was  announced  in  December  1992.  Such  surveillance 
legally  can  include  government  infiltration  of  the  party,  moni- 
toring of  mail  and  telephone  calls,  and  interrogation  of  party 
members.  The  BfV  has  classified  both  parties  as  "right-wing 
extremist"  and  "constitutionally  hostile."

Party  of  Democratic  Socialism 

The  communist  party  that  ran  East  Germany  was  the  Social- 
ist Unity  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialistische  Einheitspartei 
Deutschlands — SED).  Founded  in  1946,  the  SED  controlled 
the  government  and  the  electoral  process  and  supervised  the 
omnipresent  State  Security  Service  (Staatssicherheitsdienst — 
Stasi).  To  be  considered  for  important  positions  in  East  Ger- 
man government  and  society  membership  in  the  party  was  a 
requirement  (see  The  Ulbricht  Era,  1949-71,  ch.  2). 

When  the  East  German  public  toppled  the  communist 
regime,  the  SED  and  its  extensive  organizational  structure  also 
came  unraveled.  Membership  fell  dramatically;  local  and 
regional  party  groups  disbanded.  In  a  desperate  attempt  to 
save  itself,  the  SED  sought  to  reconstruct  itself  for  the  new 
democratic  climate.  It  changed  its  name  in  February  1990  to 
the  Party  of  Democratic  Socialism  (Partei  des  Demokratischen 
Sozialismus — PDS).  The  old  party  guard  was  replaced  by  mod- 
erate leaders,  such  as  the  new  chairman,  Gregor  Gysi.  The  PDS 
won  11  percent  of  the  vote  in  eastern  Germany  in  the  1990  all- 
Germany  election,  an  outcome  that  entitled  the  party  to  seven- 
teen seats  in  the  Bundestag.  In  the  Bundestag,  the  PDS  has 
advocated  communist  values  and  has  energetically  criticized 
the  Kohl  government.  The  PDS's  all-Germany  tally  reached 
only  2.4  percent  because  of  a  showing  in  western  Germany  of 
0.3  percent. 

The  party's  electoral  base  is  limited  to  the  east,  particularly 
areas  in  which  substantial  numbers  of  former  SED  members 
live.  In  mid-1995  the  PDS  had  roughly  130,000  members  in  the 
east,  giving  the  PDS  the  largest  membership  of  any  party  in 
eastern  Germany.  The  party's  strongholds  are  Saxony,  Berlin, 
and  Brandenburg.  The  party  continues  to  have  a  tiny  following 
in  the  west,  with  1,200  members. 

Two  main  factors  account  for  the  success  of  the  PDS  in  the 
east:  the  PDS  inherited  the  infrastructure  and  local  grassroots 
organization  of  the  SED,  and  the  PDS  has  come  to  be  seen  by 
many  in  the  east  as  the  only  party  that  represents  specifically 
eastern  German  interests  and  that  stresses  the  positive  aspects 
of  eastern  German  life.  Over  90  percent  of  PDS  members 
belonged  to  the  SED,  and  66  percent  are  over  the  age  of  sixty. 
The  established  parties  have  largely  ostracized  the  PDS. 

The  PDS  garnered  4.4  percent  of  the  vote  in  the  1994 
national  election,  an  outcome  that,  as  predicted,  left  the  party 
beneath  the  5  percent  hurdle.  However,  the  party  won  parlia- 


388 


Government  and  Politics 


mentary  representation,  thanks  to  a  peculariarity  of  the  Ger- 
man electoral  law:  the  fact  that  the  PDS  won  four  districts 
outright  (all  in  eastern  Berlin)  entitled  it  to  thirty  seats  in  the 
Bundestag.  Much  credit  for  the  strong  showing  of  the  PDS  in 
the  east  has  been  given  to  the  party's  leading  figure,  the  lawyer 
Gysi,  an  articulate  and  charismatic  member  of  parliament. 

Extraparty  Political  Forces 

German  society  is  highly  organized  into  associations  that 
represent  the  occupational,  socioeconomic,  religious,  and  rec- 
reational interests  of  individuals — a  tradition  that  dates  back  to 
the  corporate  guild  system  of  the  Middle  Ages.  Most  Germans 
belong  to  at  least  one  voluntary  association,  and  many  belong 
to  several.  The  vast  majority  of  these  organizations  (such  as 
sports  clubs)  have  little  political  significance,  but  an  important 
core  of  groups  combines  a  strong  organizational  base  with  a 
particular  interest  in  policy  issues.  The  size  of  these  interest 
groups  varies.  Smaller  groups  represent  subsectors  of  the  popu- 
lation, such  as  farmers.  The  large  associations  include  trade 
unions,  professional  associations,  and  religious  groups.  More 
than  1,000  of  these  interest  groups  are  registered  formally  as 
lobbyists  with  the  federal  government,  and  hundreds  more  are 
active  at  the  Land  level. 

The  primary  interest  associations  in  Germany  are  organized 
differently  from  interest  groups  in  the  United  States.  The 
United  States  offers  a  pluralist  model  of  interest  groups,  in 
which  loosely  structured  factions  compete  within  the  policy 
process  to  represent  the  same  social  interests.  The  government 
offers  a  neutral  forum  in  which  these  groups  vie  for  influence 
on  policy.  In  contrast,  many  of  the  major  interest  associations 
in  Germany  reflect  a  neocorporatist  model  of  interest  articula- 
tion that  channels  interests  into  a  number  of  unified,  noncom- 
petitive associations. 

Four  large,  national  "peak"  associations  (Spitzenverbdnde; 
sing.,  Spitzenverband)  represent  groups  of  similar  interest  associ- 
ations as  a  whole.  The  labor  unions,  business,  the  churches, 
and  the  agricultural  lobbying  organizations  each  has  its  own 
Spitzenverband.  Membership  in  one  of  these  peak  associations  is 
often  mandatory  for  individuals  in  a  given  social  or  occupa- 
tional sector.  Most  peak  associations  are  also  organized  hierar- 
chically, with  the  national  office  determining  the  objectives 
and  directing  the  strategy  of  the  association  as  a  whole. 


389 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

The  influence  of  the  interest  associations  is  institutionalized 
in  several  ways.  Political  parties  provide  one  major  channel  of 
influence.  Although  the  associations  eschew  formal  party  ties 
and  claim  to  remain  above  partisan  politics — for  instance,  they 
do  not  officially  endorse  a  party  at  election  time — ties  between 
these  associations  and  the  parties  are  close.  To  take  one  exam- 
ple, the  labor  unions  maintain  a  highly  developed  relationship 
with  the  Social  Democrats,  and  a  large  percentage  of  SPD  party 
activists  are  union  members.  Another  forum  for  interest  group 
activity  is  the  Bundestag.  The  interest  associations  not  only 
monitor  legislation,  lobby  members,  and  testify  at  hearings,  but 
they  also  maintain  formal  affiliations  with  deputies.  Since  1972, 
when  the  Bundestag  first  started  keeping  records,  roughly  50 
percent  of  the  members  reported  either  being  employed  by  an 
interest  group  or  holding  an  executive  position  in  a  group. 
About  25  percent  of  the  members  are  affiliated  with  economic 
groups,  such  as  labor  unions  or  the  business  lobby,  and  about 
17  percent  are  affiliated  with  religious  or  cultural  associations. 
Members  of  key  committees  such  as  agriculture,  labor,  and 
education  are  particularly  likely  to  have  ties  to  the  relevant 
groups.  The  government  ministries  themselves  provide  yet 
another  means  by  which  interest  groups  influence  the  policy 
process.  The  neocorporatist  system  encourages  formal  ties 
between  the  two.  For  instance,  ministries  are  required  by  law  to 
consult  with  the  peak  associations  about  draft  legislation  that 
would  affect  them.  To  fulfill  this  obligation,  the  federal  minis- 
tries have  established  standing  advisory  committees,  which 
include  representatives  of  the  relevant  interest  groups. 

Business  and  Industry 

There  are  three  levels  at  which  business  and  industrial  inter- 
ests seek  representation.  First,  business  wants  its  perspective 
heard  as  the  government  formulates  policy.  Second,  business 
needs  representation  in  negotiations  with  labor  unions.  Third, 
business  may  desire  support  in  cultivating  new  clients  or  suppli- 
ers. Each  of  these  objectives  is  met  by  a  separate  umbrella  orga- 
nization. 

The  Federation  of  German  Industry  (Bundesverband  der 
Deutschen  Industrie — BDI)  is  the  most  important  representa- 
tive of  business  interests  in  the  policy-making  process.  The  BDI 
is  the  national  peak  association  for  thirty-nine  separate 
national  trade  associations,  including  associations  for  the  auto- 
mobile and  machine  tool  industries.  Thus,  it  is  the  primary 


390 


Government  and  Politics 


representative  of  the  business  community  in  the  political  pro- 
cess and  the  principal  intermediary  between  business  and  gov- 
ernment. The  importance  of  the  National  Association  of 
Manufacturers  (NAM)  in  the  United  States  pales  in  compari- 
son with  that  of  the  BDI  in  Germany.  In  western  Germany,  the 
BDI's  associations  represent  over  90  percent  of  all  industrial 
firms;  by  contrast,  the  NAM  accounts  for  only  a  fragment  of 
United  States  industry.  Although  private  businesses  were  still  in 
the  early  stages  of  development  in  eastern  Germany  in  the 
early  1990s,  most  trade  associations  have  already  set  up  offices 
there  to  coordinate  the  new  industries. 

The  Federation  of  German  Employers'  Associations 
(Bundesvereinigung  der  Deutschen  Arbeitgeberverbande — 
BDA)  is  the  second  important  representative  of  business.  The 
BDA  is  a  peak  association  of  sixty-four  employers'  associations, 
consisting  of  seventeen  regional  organizations,  including  the 
employers'  associations  of  each  Land,  and  forty-seven  national 
trade  associations  organized  by  economic  sector.  The  BDA  rep- 
resents the  full  range  of  business  activity  in  Germany,  but  most 
of  its  members  are  in  industrial  associations.  Almost  every 
medium  or  large  employer  is  a  member  of  a  BDA  association. 
The  BDA  provides  advice  and  serves  as  a  coordinating  mecha- 
nism for  employers  on  social  and  labor  policy.  Among  other 
things,  the  BDA  negotiates  general  salary  guidelines  with 
unions,  and  it  lobbies  Land  and  federal  governments  on  legisla- 
tion affecting  the  interests  of  its  members,  such  as  social  secu- 
rity and  labor  practices. 

The  German  Chambers  of  Industry  and  Commerce 
(Deutscher  Industrie-  und  Handelstag — DIHT)  is  the  third  leg 
of  businesses'  representational  triad.  All  companies  paying 
business  taxes  are  required  by  law  to  join  the  local  chamber 
and  pay  membership  dues.  Thus,  several  million  firms  belong 
to  the  eighty-four  district  and  local  associations  of  the  DIHT, 
including  the  fifteen  postunification  chambers  in  eastern  Ger- 
many. Beyond  its  national  role,  the  DIHT  represents  German 
business  abroad,  as  well  as  on  international  trade  issues.  The 
DIHT  has  been  particularly  engaged  in  attracting  foreign 
investment  to  the  east. 

Labor  Unions 

During  the  Weimar  Republic,  labor  unions  were  divided 
along  partisan  lines,  a  situation  that  led  to  competition  among 
the  socialist,  communist,  Catholic,  and  liberal  trade  associa- 


391 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

tions.  After  World  War  II,  labor  leaders  wanted  to  break  with 
the  past  and  form  a  trade  union  federation  independent  of 
political  parties.  The  result  was  the  establishment  of  the  Feder- 
ation of  German  Trade  Unions  (Deutscher  Gewerkschafts- 
bund— DGB)  in  1949. 

Four  principles  guided  the  founders  of  the  DGB.  First,  the 
labor  movement  wanted  representation  through  an  organiza- 
tion that  was  unitary  and  autonomous,  with  no  ties  to  particu- 
lar religions  or  political  parties.  Second,  labor  leaders  decided 
to  organize  the  unions  along  industrial  lines  so  that  all  workers 
at  one  firm  would  belong  to  the  same  union  irrespective  of 
their  individual  occupations.  For  instance,  an  electrician  at  an 
automobile  plant  would  join  the  metalworkers'  union.  This 
organizing  principle  provides  unions  with  greater  bargaining 
power  when  negotiating  with  employer  associations,  because 
one  union  represents  the  entire  workforce  of  an  industry. 
Third,  a  decentralized  system  of  interest  representation  was 
created.  Individual  unions  typically  emulate  the  federal  struc- 
ture, with  local,  district,  Land,  and  national  offices.  Each  level 
has  some  input  into  the  shape  of  union  policy.  Fourth,  the 
unions  chose  to  rely  on  legislation  for  the  protection  of  work- 
ers' rights,  rather  than  on  direct  negotiations  with  business  rep- 
resentatives. Thus,  when  the  unions  enter  into  contract 
negotiations  with  employers,  they  can  focus  on  improving 
workers'  economic  welfare. 

The  DGB  is  the  national  peak  association  of  the  German 
labor  movement  and  encompasses  sixteen  unions,  from  metal- 
workers to  leather  workers.  The  DGB  represents  virtually  all 
organized  industrial  workers,  most  white-collar  employees,  and 
many  government  workers.  As  of  mid-1995,  out  of  a  total  work- 
force of  35  million,  9.8  million  workers  were  members  of  these 
labor  unions.  Although  the  DGB  does  not  represent  even  half 
of  the  German  workforce,  its  unions  negotiate  the  collective 
bargaining  agreements  covering  over  90  percent  of  all  jobs. 
Thus,  the  work  of  the  labor  unions  affects  nearly  all  workers. 
The  DGB  lost  over  2  million  members  between  the  end  of  1991 
and  the  end  of  1994.  The  vast  majority  of  these  members  (1.7 
million)  were  from  eastern  Germany,  which  has  been  in  the 
throes  of  radical  economic  restructuring  and  has  suffered  high 
unemployment.  Some  DGB  officials  express  the  hope  that, 
once  the  economy  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  country  stabilizes, 
DGB  membership  will  grow. 


392 


Government  and  Politics 


In  1995  the  three  largest  unions  were  the  Metalworkers' 
Union  with  just  under  3  million  members,  the  Public  Services 
and  Transport  Workers'  Union  with  1.9  million,  and  the  Chem- 
icals, Paper,  and  Ceramics  Workers'  Union  with  742,000. 
Roughly  31  percent  of  all  members  are  women. 

DGB  members  can  be  divided  into  "activist"  and  "accommo- 
dationist"  factions.  The  activists,  led  by  the  Metalworkers' 
Union  and  the  Industriegewerkschaft  Medien,  the  union  for 
workers  in  the  media,  aggressively  challenge  business  interests 
and  are  major  advocates  of  social  reform.  For  example,  the 
Metalworkers'  Union  led  the  drive  for  codetermination  (Mit- 
bestimmung)  in  the  early  1950s,  for  substantial  wage  gains  in  the 
1960s,  and  for  the  thirty-five-hour  workweek  in  the  1980s  (see 
Codetermination,  ch.  5).  The  activist  unions  are  more  likely  to 
strike  if  collective  bargaining  fails  to  achieve  desired  results.  In 
contrast,  the  accommodationist  unions,  including  those  repre- 
senting chemical  workers,  construction  workers,  textile  work- 
ers, and  food-processing  workers,  prefer  to  cooperate  with 
employers  to  achieve  stable,  sustainable  economic  growth.  The 
individual  unions  have  responded  differently  to  German  unifi- 
cation as  well.  Activist  unions  have  been  assertive  in  pushing 
for  wage  equalization  between  east  and  west,  an  effort  that  cul- 
minated in  a  massive  strike  in  the  metalworking  industry  in 
eastern  Germany  in  May  1993. 

Two  other,  significantly  smaller  peak  interest  associations 
represent  labor  sectors  independent  of  the  DGB.  The  German 
White-Collar  Employees'  Union  (Deutsche  Angestellten- 
Gewerkschaft — DAG)  is  composed  solely  of  salaried  employ- 
ees, principally  high-level  technocrats  and  managers  in  private 
enterprise.  The  Federation  of  German  Civil  Servants  (Deut- 
scher  Beamten  Bund — DBB)  has  competed  successfully  with 
the  DGB  to  represent  civil  servants.  The  DBB  is  better 
described  as  a  lobbying  organization,  because  civil  servants  can 
neither  strike  nor  engage  in  collective  bargaining. 

The  Churches 

Religious  associations  represent  a  third  major  group  of  orga- 
nized interests  in  the  German  policy  process.  The  experience 
of  the  Third  Reich  had  a  profound  influence  on  the  postwar 
development  of  Protestant  and  Roman  Catholic  churches  in 
the  Federal  Republic  (see  Religion,  ch.  3).  Both  espoused  the 
view  that  moral  responsibility  extends  to  political  responsibility 
and  that  passivity  toward  the  political  process  is  inappropriate. 


393 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Both  also  desired  greater  ecumenism  in  German  society.  The 
establishment  of  the  CDU  perhaps  best  illustrates  this  last 
point.  The  CDU  sought  to  include  both  Roman  Catholics  and 
Protestants  in  a  catchall  party  that  was  committed  to  Christian 
values.  The  two  churches  maintain  distinct  identities,  but  the 
major  cleavage  in  German  society  is  no  longer  between  reli- 
gious denominations,  but  between  religious  and  secular  inter- 
ests. 

In  postwar  West  Germany,  many  people  felt  that  organized 
religion  was  an  important  element  in  the  country's  newly  form- 
ing political  ethos.  Unlike  the  United  States,  West  Germany 
acknowledged  no  separation  of  church  and  state.  The  state  for- 
mally recognized  the  political  role  of  the  churches,  establishing 
a  special  legal  status  for  them  as  public  law  corporations. 
Under  a  German  system  developed  in  the  nineteenth  century, 
unless  church  members  formally  leave  the  denomination  into 
which  they  were  baptized,  they  must  pay  an  annual  church  sur- 
tax equal  to  8  or  9  percent  of  their  income  tax.  The  federal  gov- 
ernment collects  this  surcharge  and  remits  the  proceeds  to  the 
churches  to  finance  their  activities.  In  1992  the  figure  totaled 
about  US$10  billion  for  Protestant  and  Catholic  churches  com- 
bined. Churches  are  included  on  government  commissions 
and  supervisory  bodies  that  influence  social  and  family  policy, 
education,  and  related  topics. 

Not  surprisingly,  the  relationship  between  church  and  state 
in  East  Germany  was  markedly  different.  The  communist 
regime  wanted  control  over  all  aspects  of  society,  and  the  exist- 
ence of  autonomous  churches  was  unacceptable.  In  the  1950s, 
the  regime  sought  to  limit  the  role  of  the  churches  to  the  reli- 
gious sphere,  keeping  them  out  of  politics  or  education.  The 
state  proved  unable  to  suppress  the  churches  fully,  however, 
and  by  the  1970s  the  SED  had  resigned  itself  to  accommodat- 
ing them. 

Roman  Catholics  constituted  only  7  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion in  the  east;  thus,  it  was  the  Protestant  church,  with  broad 
backing  among  East  Germans,  that  played  an  important  social 
and  political  role.  The  Protestant  church  retained  some  auton- 
omy from  the  state,  and  by  the  late  1980s  the  church  had 
become  gathering  places  for  dissidents.  In  1989  weekly  peace 
services  at  churches  in  big  cities,  such  as  East  Berlin  and 
Leipzig,  became  hotbeds  of  opposition  to  the  regime  and  led 
to  the  mass  demonstrations  that  ultimately  brought  down  the 
communist  regime.

Government  and  Politics 


The  Evangelical  Church  in  Germany  (Evangelische  Kirche 
in  Deutschland — EKD),  the  peak  association  for  the  seventeen 
autonomous  provincial  churches  in  West  Germany,  was  estab- 
lished in  1948.  The  structural  unity  of  the  German  Protestant 
church  officially  ended  in  19.69,  when  the  eight  provincial 
churches  in  East  Germany  withdrew  from  the  EKD  and  formed 
the  Federation  of  the  Evangelical  Churches  (Bund  der  Evange- 
lischen  Kirchen — BEK).  German  unity  ushered  in  the  reunifi- 
cation of  these  two  federations  in  1991,  under  the  auspices  of 
the  EKD.  As  the  formal  political  representative  of  German 
Protestant  churches,  the  EKD  represents  its  member  congrega- 
tions in  all  formal  agreements  with  the  government  on  church- 
state  affairs.  On  religious  and  social  matters,  however,  the  EKD 
serves  only  as  a  coordinating  agent  for  its  largely  independent 
member  churches. 

The  principal  organizational  forum  for  the  German  Roman 
Catholic  Church  is  the  Bishops'  Conference,  at  which  all  Ger- 
man bishops  convene  semiannually.  Since  unification,  the  east- 
ern bishops  also  have  attended  these  meetings.  As  elsewhere  in 
the  Catholic  world,  all  decisions  on  theological  matters  and 
general  policy  emanate  from  the  Vatican;  the  annual  Bishops' 
Conference  addresses  current  pastoral  and  religious  issues 
within  Germany. 

In  West  Germany,  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  was  tradition- 
ally much  more  active  politically  on  a  day-to-day  basis  than  the 
Protestant  denominations.  The  Bishops'  Conference  maintains 
a  permanent  secretariat  in  Bonn  to  monitor  activity  in  parlia- 
ment and  in  the  federal  ministries.  Catholic  leaders  regularly 
lobby  the  government  on  pending  legislation  relating  to  social 
or  moral  issues.  The  EKD  participates  less  actively  in  the  politi- 
cal process,  but  it  is  more  inclined  than  its  Catholic  counter- 
part to  speak  out  on  controversial  political  issues  that  have 
spiritual  implications.  Examples  include  the  Protestant 
church's  strong  stance  against  the  remilitarization  of  West  Ger- 
many in  the  1950s  and  its  continued  activism  in  the  areas  of 
peace  and  nuclear  nonproliferation. 

Agriculture 

Although  agriculture  accounts  for  only  5  percent  of  the 
labor  force  in  western  Germany,  the  agricultural  lobby  has  long 
been  known  as  the  best  organized  and  most  successful  in  Bonn. 
The  peak  association  of  this  lobby,  the  German  Farmers  Associ- 
ation (Deutscher  Bauernverband — DBV),  focuses  exclusively 


395 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

on  farm  issues.  The  DBV  has  consistently  convinced  the  gov- 
ernment to  guarantee  the  financial  welfare  of  farmers  through 
generous  programs  of  price  supports,  subsidies,  and  agricul- 
tural grants.  These  programs  have  made  German  food  costs 
among  the  highest  in  Western  Europe,  but  no  strong  call  for 
reform  has  ever  emerged.  The  minister  of  agriculture  is  often  a 
farmer  and,  regardless  of  whether  the  CDU  or  the  SPD  is  in 
power,  that  minister  has  single-mindedly  pursued  policies  ben- 
eficial to  farmers. 

Citizens'  Initiative  Associations 

In  the  early  1970s,  a  new  form  of  political  participation  in 
the  form  of  citizens'  initiative  associations  sprang  up  through- 
out West  Germany.  These  associations,  in  essence  nontradi- 
tional  interest  groups,  were  loosely  and  often  temporarily 
organized  groups  of  citizens  mobilized  in  response  to  one  par- 
ticular local  issue.  Concerns  ranged  from  school  reform,  urban 
redevelopment,  and  traffic  to  environmental  protection.  The 
staying  power  of  these  associations  reflected  a  dissatisfaction 
with  established  political  institutions.  Unlike  traditional  inter- 
est groups,  these  associations  aimed  to  improve  the  quality  of 
life,  rather  than  the  material  well-being,  of  their  supporters. 
Although  their  ultimate  goal  is  to  produce  a  new  social  model, 
these  groups  tend  to  be  more  skilled  at  critiquing  the  existing 
order  than  at  constructing  a  new  one.  Activists  in  these  organi- 
zations tend  overwhelmingly  to  be  young  and  highly  educated, 
espousing  a  New  Left  ideology.  Citizens'  initiative  associations 
employ  diverse  tactics,  ranging  from  lobbying  and  circulating 
petitions  to  organizing  mass  demonstrations  and  protest 
marches.  Three  major  political  movements  have  grown  out  of 
these  associations:  the  environmental  lobby,  the  women's 
movement,  and  the  peace  lobby. 

With  public  consciousness  of  the  environment  growing  sub- 
stantially in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  a  new  set  of  nationwide  orga- 
nizations was  formed,  including  the  Federal  Association  of 
Citizens'  Initiatives  on  Environmental  Protection  (Bundesver- 
band  Burgerinitiativen  Umweltschutz — BBU),  Greenpeace, 
and  Robin  Wood.  The  BBU  was  at  its  strongest  in  the  late 
1970s,  when  it  coordinated  more  than  1,000  local  citizens'  ini- 
tiative associations  and  when  almost  1  million  people  were  affil- 
iated with  the  environmental  movement.  By  the  late  1980s,  the 
BBU  was  associated  with  several  hundred  local  groups  whose 
cumulative  membership  reached  only  150,000.  Environmental 


396 


Government  and  Politics 


activists  have  focused  on  a  range  of  issues,  including  nuclear 
power,  acid  rain,  and  Waldsterben  (death  of  the  forest). 

The  women's  movement,  organized  in  the  late  1960s  and 
early  1970s,  sought  to  fight  discrimination  against  women  in 
the  workplace  and  at  home.  Guarantees  of  gender  equality  in 
the  Basic  Law  had  done  little  to  alter  the  traditional  male  bias 
within  society.  The  women's  movement  in  western  Germany 
developed  a  two-pronged  approach  to  securing  equality  for 
women:  programs  for  raising  the  consciousness  of  women,  and 
programs  aimed  at  legislative  reform.  The  first  approach 
focused  on  the  personal  development  of  women  and  has  met 
with  success  at  the  local  level,  with  most  larger  cities  offering  a 
women's  center,  women's  bookstores,  self-help  groups,  and  a 
network  of  other  women's  organizations.  The  attempt  at  the 
national  level  to  mobilize  the  movement's  supporters  and  bring 
about  legislative  change  remains  underdeveloped. 

The  peace  movement  blossomed  in  the  early  1980s  in 
response  to  the  controversy  over  the  stationing  of  intermedi- 
ate-range nuclear  weapons  in  West  Germany.  Mass  demonstra- 
tions called  for  the  government  to  pursue  arms  control 
negotiations  to  eliminate  these  weapons  altogether.  Instead, 
the  Bundestag  voted  for  deployment  in  October  1983,  and, 
with  its  major  objective  lost,  the  peace  movement  lost  momen- 
tum. The  end  of  the  Gold  War  brought  a  reduction  in  East- 
West  tensions  and  the  conclusion  of  substantial  arms  control 
agreements.  These  developments  have  further  deprived  the 
peace  movement  of  focus.  The  peace  movement  was  able  to 
mobilize  activity  against  the  Persian  Gulf  War  in  early  1991, 
however. 

Autonomous  citizens'  initiative  associations  were  unaccept- 
able in  East  Germany.  The  communist  government  established 
official  organizations — the  Society  for  Nature  and  the  Environ- 
ment, the  Peace  Council,  and  the  Democratic  Women's  Federa- 
tion of  Germany — to  co-opt  the  issues.  The  peaceful  revolution 
of  1989  that  brought  down  the  communist  regime  in  East  Ger- 
many showed  both  the  willingness  among  eastern  Germans  to 
demonstrate  and  protest  in  large  numbers,  as  well  as  the  power 
of  such  citizen  action.  Nonetheless,  the  levels  of  protest  and 
direct  action  are  lower  in  the  east  than  in  the  west.  However,  as 
easterners  become  more  accustomed  to  the  freedoms  afforded 
in  a  democracy,  it  is  thought  that  they  might  become  more 
inclined  to  exercise  them.

The  Mass  Media 
Newspapers 

West  Germany  has  always  had  highly  developed  mass  media. 
The  independence  of  the  press  and  its  freedom  from  censor- 
ship are  guaranteed  in  Article  5  of  the  Basic  Law.  Conversely, 
the  communist  regime  in  East  Germany  tightly  controlled  the 
media.  Despite  government  censorship,  East  Germans  were 
voracious  newspaper  and  magazine  readers.  More  than  three 
dozen  newspapers  enjoyed  a  combined  circulation  of  almost  10 
million  in  the  GDR. 

The  complexion  of  the  print  media  in  eastern  Germany 
changed  markedly  with  unification.  By  mid-1991  only  100,000 
copies  of  East  Germany's  most  widely  circulated  newspaper, 
Neues  Deutschland,  the  newspaper  of  the  communist  party,  were 
being  printed  daily,  down  from  roughly  1  million  in  the  recent 
past.  Western  consortia  bought  many  of  the  other  established 
urban  newspapers  and  brought  in  new  management.  Accord- 
ing to  a  public  opinion  survey  during  the  1990  national  elec- 
tion, 68  percent  of  western  Germans  and  88  percent  of  eastern 
Germans  read  a  newspaper  on  a  regular  basis.  Not  surprisingly, 
Germany  boasts  among  the  highest  per  capita  newspaper  circu- 
lations within  Europe. 

The  press  is  privately  owned,  and  most  Germans  rely  on 
local  or  regional  newspapers  for  their  information.  Five  daily 
newspapers  enjoy  good  reputations  nationally  because  of  their 
sophisticated  domestic  and  international  coverage:  Frankfurter 
Allgemeine  Zeitung  (FAZ),  Suddeutsche  Zeitung,  Frankfurter  Rund- 
schau, Handelsblatt,  and  Die  Welt.  The  FAZ  is  probably  Ger- 
many's most  prestigious  daily  newspaper  and  is  the  one 
newspaper  read  by  virtually  all  members  of  the  political  and 
business  establishment.  Although  independent  of  any  political 
party,  its  views  are  similar  to  those  of  the  right-of-center  CDU. 
Handelsblatt  is  the  leading  business  daily.  Die  Zeit,  a  weekly  news- 
paper, provides  an  erudite  review  of  news  and  culture  from  a 
perspective  sympathetic  to  Social  Democratic  views.  Weekly  edi- 
tions of  Die  Zeit  are  often  more  than  100  pages,  with  in-depth 
articles  filling  an  entire  page.  Former  chancellor  Schmidt  is 
one  of  its  publishers;  the  paper's  circulation  is  493,000. 
Because  these  newspapers  appeal  to  an  elite  readership,  their 
circulation  figures  are  much  lower  than  that  of  the  tabloid 
press.  Bild  Zeitung,  with  a  daily  circulation  of  close  to  5  million, 
is  Germany's  most  widely  circulated  daily.  It  puts  a  sensational- 


398 


Government  and  Politics 


ist  spin  on  topical  issues  and  tends  to  support  right-of-center 
policies. 

Both  Bild  Zeitung  and  Die  Welt  are  published  by  the  Axel 
Springer  Group,  based  in  Hamburg.  Axel  Springer,  now 
deceased,  built  an  enormous  media  empire,  which  also 
includes  the  two  largest  Sunday  newspapers,  Bild  am  Sonntag 
and  Welt  am  Sonntag,  two  Berlin  daily  newspapers,  and  many 
popular  magazines.  Springer  publications  are  generally  consid- 
ered to  have  a  strong  conservative  bent. 

The  liberal  counterpart  to  Axel  Springer  and  his  successors 
has  been  Rudolf  Augstein,  founder  and  publisher  of  the  weekly 
Der  Spiegel,  a  highly  respected  and  influential  newsmagazine 
combining  news  coverage  with  investigative  journalism.  The 
magazine's  decidedly  liberal  critique  of  politics  and  politicians 
has  often  steeped  it  in  controversy  (see  Ludwig  Erhard  and  the 
Grand  Coalition,  ch.  2).  In  1994  its  circulation  stood  at  over  1 
million  copies.  Der  Spiegelis  distributed  in  165  countries,  and 
close  to  15  percent  of  its  sales  are  outside  Germany. 

In  1993  competition  for  market  share  held  by  Der  Spiegel 
emerged  with  the  publication  of  Focus,  a  newsmagazine  fash- 
ioned after  Time  and  Newsweek,  with  shorter  articles  and  a  more 
colorful  layout  than  that  offered  by  Der  Spiegel  Focus  appeared 
on  newsstands  in  January  1993,  was  less  expensive  than  Der  Spie- 
gel, and,  after  a  few  months,  was  faring  better  than  expected.  By 
mid-April  Focus  was  maintaining  a  circulation  of  600,000  and 
had  exceeded  its  annual  target  for  pages  of  advertising  sold. 
Since  its  founding  in  1946,  Der  Spiegel  has  successfully  faced 
down  competition  from  more  than  fifty  publications.  However, 
the  circulation  of  Focus  is  growing  while  that  of  Der  Spiegel  is  fall- 
ing. 

Although  newspapers  owned  by  political  parties  were  com- 
mon during  the  Weimar  period,  the  partisan  press  is  much  less 
significant  in  the  Germany  of  the  1990s.  Vorwdrts  is  the  official 
newspaper  of  the  SPD,  and  Bayernkurier  serves  the  GSU.  Rhei- 
nis cher  Merkur has  informal  links  to  the  CDU,  and  Neues  Deutsch- 
land  offers  views  of  the  PDS. 

Radio  and  Television 

Radio  and  television  are  administered  in  a  decentralized 
fashion  as  prescribed  in  the  Basic  Law.  The  intent  behind  the 
pattern  of  regional  decentralization  is  to  prevent  the  exploita- 
tion of  the  media  by  a  strong  national  government,  as  had  hap- 
pened under  the  Nazi  dictatorship.  Germany  has  two  public 


399 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

broadcasting  corporations.  The  first,  ARD,  was  established  in 
1954  and  encompasses  eleven  regional  public  television  and 
radio  stations.  ARD  employs  roughly  23,000  people  and  has  an 
annual  budget  of  about  US$6  billion.  The  second,  ZDF  was 
founded  in  1961  and  is  structured  as  a  single  corporation,  not 
as  a  consortium.  A  third  channel  broadcasts  cultural  and  edu- 
cational programs  for  all  Land  corporations. 

The  Land  broadcasting  corporations  have  similar  organiza- 
tional structures.  Each  governs  itself  under  the  direction  of  a 
broadcasting  council  consisting — in  most  Lander — of  represen- 
tatives of  the  major  social,  economic,  cultural,  and  political 
groups,  including  political  parties,  churches,  unions,  and  busi- 
ness organizations.  The  broadcasting  corporations  are 
financed  largely  through  monthly  fees  (DM23.80  per  house- 
hold as  of  late  1994)  charged  to  television  and  radio  owners. 
Public  television  is  allowed  to  devote  no  more  than  thirty  min- 
utes per  day  to  commercial  advertisements.  No  advertisements 
are  aired  after  8:00  RM.  on  weekdays  or  on  Sundays.  Advertis- 
ing provides  roughly  one-third  of  television  revenues  and  one- 
fourth  of  radio  revenues.  What  distinguishes  public  television 
from  commercial  television  is  the  ability  to  offer  greater  cover- 
age of  public  service  activities  and  cultural  events. 

Most  eastern  Germans  were  familiar  with  western  German 
television  even  before  unification  because  broadcasts  from  the 
west  could  be  received  in  most  of  East  Germany.  According  to  a 
1990  survey,  49  percent  of  western  Germans  and  70  percent  of 
eastern  Germans  watched  a  nightly  news  program  at  least  five 
times  each  week.  Surveys  also  indicate  that  television  is  the 
most  important  source  of  political  information:  51  percent  of 
Germans  rank  television  first,  ahead  of  newspapers  and  maga- 
zines (22  percent),  conversation  (16  percent),  and  radio  (6 
percent). 

Private  broadcasting  was  virtually  nonexistent  in  West  Ger- 
many until  1981,  when  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court  recog- 
nized the  right  of  the  Lander  to  grant  broadcasting  licenses  to 
private  companies.  Enabling  legislation  took  the  form  of  a  new 
broadcasting  treaty  enacted  by  the  Lander  in  1987  that  allowed 
the  creation  of  private  broadcasting  companies  to  compete 
with  public  stations.  In  general,  private  broadcasters  do  not 
have  an  internal  supervisory  council,  but  the  Lander  in  which 
they  broadcast  can  exercise  supervisory  rights. 

Commercial  broadcasters  finance  their  operations  solely 
with  advertising  revenues.  Beyond  the  substantial  capital  costs 


400 


Government  and  Politics 


associated  with  starting  up  a  new  television  channel,  private 
broadcasters  have  to  rely  on  satellite  and  cable  transmission 
because  the  airwaves  do  not  offer  unlimited  capacity.  Thus, 
viewers  have  to  pay  an  additional  fee  to  get  access  to  private 
channels.  In  1983  the  federal  post  office  undertook  a  large- 
scale  program  of  wiring  the  country  for  cable  television.  In 
March  1993,  of  the  27  million  households  in  western  Germany 
that  had  televisions,  70  percent  had  access  to  cable  service;  of 
the  6.4  million  households  in  eastern  Germany,  12  percent  had 
access  to  cable.  However,  at  that  point  only  about  60  percent  of 
those  eligible  households  had  chosen  to  subscribe  to  cable. 

In  1985  SAT-1  became  Germany's  first  private  satellite  televi- 
sion station.  A  group  of  publishing  firms,  including  Springer, 
owns  SAT-1;  the  channel  offers  a  program  of  popular  enter- 
tainment and  news.  Other  stations  subsequently  sprang  up, 
including  3-SAT,  a  joint  production  of  German,  Swiss,  and  Aus- 
trian national  television;  RTL,  or  Radio-Television-Luxem- 
bourg; and  various  European  satellite  stations.  In  early  1993, 
two  all-news  channels  made  their  debut:  Time  Warner  and 
CNN  own  one,  n-tv;  and  German  publishing  giant  Bertelsmann 
and  the  Siiddeutsche  Zeitung  are  major  financial  backers  of  Vox, 
the  second  news  channel.  Vox  failed  quickly,  however,  closing 
its  doors  in  April  1994.  On  the  whole,  private  channels  none- 
theless are  prospering.  The  percentage  of  Germans  watching 
public  channels  has  dropped  to  less  than  one-half  since  the 
start  of  private  broadcasting  in  1987. 

Political  Developments  since  Unification 

The  political  institutions  of  unified  Germany  are  remarkably 
similar  to  those  of  the  former  West  Germany,  reflecting  minor 
adjustments  to  accommodate  the  larger  population  rather 
than  making  fundamental  changes.  The  unfolding  drama  of 
unification  is  much  more  evident  when  one  takes  into  consid- 
eration Germany's  political  landscape,  including  elections, 
political  climate  in  the  unified  country,  and  issues  that  have 
dominated  that  landscape. 

The  Bundestag  election  of  December  2,  1990,  was  the  first 
all-Germany  election  since  1932.  The  election  returned  to 
power  the  governing  coalition  of  the  CDU/CSU  and  the  FDR 
The  central  issue  of  the  campaign  was  unification.  Parties  that 
strongly  supported  unification  scored  well;  those  that  were 
ambivalent  or  opposed  to  unification,  such  as  the  SPD  and  the 
Greens,  fared  poorly. 


401 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Helmut  Kohl's  political  fortunes  soon  declined,  however,  in 
the  wake  of  problems  with  the  unification  process.  Increasing 
unemployment  in  the  east,  and  anger  in  the  west  about  a  tax 
increase  that  Kohl  had  pledged  to  avoid  before  the  1990  elec- 
tion, caused  the  CDU  to  lose  a  series  of  Land  elections  after 
unification.  As  a  result,  in  1991  the  ruling  coalition  lost  its 
majority  in  the  Bundesrat  when  the  CDU  lost  power  in  the 
Lander  of  Hesse  and  Rhineland-Palatinate  (Kohl's  home  Land). 
This  development  made  it  more  difficult  for  the  Kohl  govern- 
ment to  gain  approval  for  key  legislative  initiatives. 

The  year  1994  was  nicknamed  the  "super  election  year" 
because  Germany  conducted  approximately  twenty  elections  at 
the  local,  Land,  federal,  and  European  levels,  culminating  in 
the  national  election  in  October.  In  eight  Land  elections 
throughout  1994,  the  SPD  fared  better  than  did  the  CDU.  The 
SPD  thus  increased  its  majority  in  the  Bundesrat.  The  FDP  per- 
formed miserably  at  the  Land  level,  failing  to  gain  the  required 
5  percent  for  representation  in  all  eight  elections.  Given  this 
poor  showing,  many  observers  question  the  staying  power  of 
the  FDP  as  a  political  force  in  Germany.  Observers  were  sur- 
prised by  the  strength  of  the  former  Communists  (PDS)  in  the 
eastern  Lander,  all  five  new  Lander  held  elections  in  1994,  with 
the  PDS  garnering  from  16  to  23  percent  of  the  vote  in  each 
(see  table  21,  Appendix).  The  PDS  increased  its  share  of  the 
vote  over  the  results  in  1990  and  solidified  the  party's  position 
as  the  third  strongest  political  force  in  eastern  Germany.  On 
November  9,  1994,  Germans  celebrated  the  fifth  anniversary  of 
the  fall  of  the  Berlin  Wall.  However,  much  still  divides  eastern 
and  western  Germans,  not  least  economic  success,  and  the  PDS 
was  able  to  capitalize  on  eastern  resentments. 

Germans  voted  in  national  elections  on  October  16,  1994. 
Chancellor  Kohl  was  challenged  by  Rudolf  Scharping,  the  min- 
ister president  of  the  western  Land  of  Rhineland-Palatinate  and 
the  chairman  of  the  SPD.  Election  themes  included  unemploy- 
ment and  economic  growth,  particularly  in  light  of  unification, 
as  well  as  law  and  order.  Except  for  the  future  of  the  EU,  for- 
eign policy  issues  did  not  figure  in  the  election  campaign. 

Scharping  began  1994  with  a  strong  lead  in  public  opinion 
polls,  but,  beginning  in  late  April,  the  SPD's  support  began  a 
sustained  decline  for  several  reasons.  First,  the  CDU  benefited 
from  an  increasingly  positive  economic  outlook  in  Germany. 
Second,  Scharping  was  seen  by  many  to  be  a  lackluster  candi- 
date; further,  he  was  not  wholly  successful  in  portraying  himself

as  the  conciliator  who  had  brought  harmony  to  a  traditionally 
fractious  SPD.  Chancellor  Kohl,  however,  was  seen  to  embody 
stability,  continuity  and  predictability;  one  of  his  election  slo- 
gans was  "no  experiments."  Third,  the  CDU/CSU  launched  a 
fierce  campaign  against  the  PDS,  whose  members  had 
belonged  to  the  Communist  SED,  calling  them  "red-painted 
fascists,"  and  Kohl  succeeded  in  incriminating  the  SPD,  at  least 
marginally,  in  this  seeming  Communist  revival.  The  SPD  pro- 
vided Kohl  with  this  opportunity  by  forming  a  minority  govern- 
ment with  the  Greens  in  the  eastern  Land  of  Saxony-Anhalt 
that  depended  on  the  votes  (or  abstention)  of  the  PDS  to 
remain  in  office.  This  CDU/CSU  tactic  was  aimed,  effectively  it 
would  seem,  at  those  western  German  voters  who,  despite 
Scharping,  questioned  the  SPD's  commitment  to  centrist  poli- 
cies. 

Kohl's  governing  coalition  claimed  a  narrow  victory;  its 
majority  in  the  Bundestag  was  reduced  from  134  to  ten  seats 
(see  table  4,  Appendix).  The  Greens  and  the  former  Commu- 
nists also  won  representation  in  the  Bundestag.  The  far-right 
Republikaner,  seen  as  a  spent  political  force,  failed  to  clear  the 
5  percent  hurdle  necessary  to  enter  the  Bundestag.  Voter  turn- 
out, up  slightly  from  the  1990  election,  was  79.1  percent.  Fol- 
lowing the  election,  Scharping  became  the  leader  of  the  SPD's 
parliamentary  group  in  the  Bundestag,  which  will  allow  him  to 
keep  a  high  national  profile  in  preparation  for  the  next 
national  election.  The  coalition  government  of  Kohl's  CDU, 
the  CSU,  and  the  FDP  will  focus  on  creating  jobs,  trimming 
bureaucracy,  fighting  crime,  and  expanding  the  EU  eastward. 

The  FDP's  seemingly  chronic  inability  to  win  representation 
in  Land  parliaments  means  that  it  is  increasingly  losing  its 
regional  bases  and  its  reservoirs  of  future  political  talent.  If  and 
how  the  FDP  can  regenerate  support  remains  to  be  seen. 
Recent  CDU  overtures  to  the  Greens — until  recently  an 
unthinkable  development — also  suggest  a  CDU  awareness  of 
the  possible  need  for  an  alternate  coalition  partner  in  the 
future.  The  1994  election  may  thus  mark  the  beginning  of 
some  profound  changes  in  political  alignments  in  Germany. 

Unified  Germany's  second  national  election  suggests  that 
the  country's  east-west  divide  has  not  narrowed.  The  strongest 
evidence  is  the  success  of  the  PDS  in  winning  parliamentary 
representation.  In  eastern  Germany,  the  PDS  received  19.2  per- 
cent of  the  vote,  compared  with  only  0.9  percent  in  the  west. 
The  national  tally  of  4.4  percent  was  insufficient  to  clear  the  5 


403 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

percent  hurdle  for  parliamentary  representation,  but  the  PDS 
benefited  from  an  oft-forgotten  electoral  law  that  automatically 
qualifies  a  party  for  representation  according  to  its  overall 
share  of  the  national  vote  when  the  party  wins  three  electoral 
districts  outright  (first  votes).  The  PDS  surprised  seemingly 
everyone  in  winning  four  districts  outright  (all  in  eastern  Ber- 
lin), entitling  it  to  thirty  seats  in  the  Bundestag. 

The  future  of  the  PDS  is  unclear  and  may  well  depend  on 
whether  the  CDU  and  the  SPD  develop  programs  that  attract 
current  PDS  constituents.  Kohl's  coalition  lost  twice  as  many 
votes  in  the  east  as  in  the  west,  winning  49.9  percent  of  the  vote 
in  the  west  and  42.5  percent  in  the  east.  The  SPD  faces  the 
challenge  in  the  east  of  competing  against  two  other  parties  of 
the  left,  the  PDS  and  the  Greens.  When  considering  the  success 
of  the  PDS,  however,  one  must  recall  that  80  percent  of  eastern 
Germans  did  not  vote  for  the  former  Communists.  At  present, 
PDS  leaders  are  working  to  rid  the  party  of  its  Stalinist  heritage; 
if  successful,  the  PDS  would  certainly  have  a  broader  appeal. 

As  of  mid-1995,  right-wing  extremist  parties  held  seats  in 
three  of  sixteen  Land  parliaments  (Baden-Wurtemberg,  Bre- 
men, and  Schleswig-Holstein)  and  appeared  to  be  fading  from 
the  German  political  landscape.  The  most  significant  of  these 
parties,  the  Republikaner,  with  about  23,000  members, 
attracted  support  principally  by  criticizing  a  government  policy 
that  allowed  hundreds  of  thousands  of  asylum-seekers  into  Ger- 
many. However,  the  Kohl  government  engineered  a  revision  of 
the  German  constitution  in  1992  that  severely  restricts  the  right 
to  asylum  (which  had  been  the  most  liberal  in  Europe),  thus 
largely  calming  public  concerns.  The  far  right  has  thereby  lost 
its  major  platform  and  has  been  tainted  by  violent  attacks 
against  foreigners  in  Germany.  In-fighting  has  also  divided  the 
party  and  resulted  in  the  ouster  of  leader  Franz  Schonhuber,  a 
former  Waffen-SS  member  and  the  party's  one  nationally 
known  figure  (see  The  Republikaner  and  the  German  People's 
Union,  this  ch.).  In  the  October  1994  election,  with  close  to  80 
percent  voter  turnout,  the  Republikaner  received  only  1.9  per- 
cent of  the  national  vote,  thus  once  again  failing  to  win  repre- 
sentation in  the  Bundestag.  This  outcome  cemented  a 
downward  trend,  which  had  been  evinced  in  the  European  Par- 
liament election  and  Land  elections  throughout  the  year.  That 
downward  trend  is  particularly  notable  in  light  of  the  fact  that 
extreme  right  parties  have  met  with  considerable  electoral  suc-

cess  in  several  West  European  countries,  such  as  France,  Bel- 
gium, and  Italy. 

A  plethora  of  controversial  issues  has  marked  political 
debate  in  united  Germany,  for  example,  the  right  to  political 
asylum,  the  upsurge  in  right-wing  violence,  and  the  tensions 
surrounding  the  unification  process  itself.  The  Basic  Law  origi- 
nally contained  a  liberal  regulation  on  the  right  to  asylum,  and 
in  1992  a  total  of  438,191  asylum-seekers  streamed  into  Ger- 
many— up  from  256,112  in  1991.  Most  asylum-seekers  were 
from  Romania,  the  former  Yugoslavia,  and  Bulgaria.  Many  Ger- 
mans complained  that  the  German  law  permitted  many  people 
who  were  not  political  refugees,  but  rather  economic  migrants, 
to  take  advantage  of  the  country's  generous  welfare  system  and 
compete  with  Germans  for  scarce  housing.  Extreme  right-wing 
parties  capitalized  on  this  widespread  resentment  against  asy- 
lum-seekers in  April  1992  elections  in  two  western  Lander. 

On  December  6,  1992,  Kohl's  governing  coalition  and  the 
opposition  Social  Democrats  agreed  on  a  constitutional 
amendment  to  limit  the  right  to  asylum.  The  asylum  compro- 
mise between  the  government  and  the  opposition  included  sev- 
eral important  changes.  First,  asylum-seekers  from  European 
Community  (EC — see  Glossary)  states  or  states  that  accept  the 
Geneva  Convention  on  Refugees  and  the  European  Human 
Rights  Convention  have  no  right  to  asylum  in  Germany.  Sec- 
ond, any  refugee  passing  through  "safe  third  countries,"  which 
include  all  of  Germany's  neighbors,  is  ineligible  for  asylum.  An 
individual  may  appeal  this  decision  but  may  not  stay  in  Ger- 
many during  the  course  of  that  appeal.  In  exchange  for  these 
concessions,  the  Social  Democrats  won  agreements  to  place  an 
annual  limit  of  200,000  on  the  immigration  of  ethnic  Germans 
eligible  for  automatic  German  citizenship  and  to  ease  the 
terms  of  citizenship  for  longtime  foreign  residents  of  Germany 
(see  Immigration,  ch.  3).  Parliament  approved  the  new  asylum 
law  in  late  May  1993,  and  it  took  effect  on  July  1.  About  10,000 
protesters  surrounded  the  Bundestag  on  the  day  of  the  vote, 
but  apparently  about  70  percent  of  Germans  approved  the 
more  restrictive  asylum  law.  The  number  of  foreigners  seeking 
asylum  in  Germany  has  fallen  substantially  since  the  new  law 
went  into  effect. 

Another  pressing  issue  has  been  the  escalation  of  right-wing 
violence.  In  1992  right-wing  extremists  committed  2,584  acts  of 
violence  in  Germany,  an  increase  of  74  percent  from  1991.  Sev- 
enteen people  were  killed  in  the  1992  attacks,  six  in  1991. 


405 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

About  60  percent  of  the  attacks  occurred  in  western  Germany 
and  40  percent  in  eastern  Germany — home  to  only  20  percent 
of  the  population.  About  90  percent  of  the  right-wing  attacks  in 
1992  were  directed  against  foreigners — above  all,  at  asylum- 
seekers  and  their  lodgings.  People  under  the  age  of  twenty-one 
committed  70  percent  of  these  attacks. 

In  November  1992,  three  Turkish  residents  were  killed  in  a 
firebombing  in  Molln  in  western  Germany.  Of  the  80  million 
people  living  in  Germany  in  1993,  about  1.8  million  were 
Turks,  making  that  ethnic  group  the  country's  largest  minority. 
Two-thirds  of  those  Turks  had  lived  in  Germany  at  least  a 
decade.  The  overwhelming  majority  of  Germans  condemn 
xenophobia  and  neo-Nazism,  and  after  the  Molln  attack,  over  3 
million  Germans  demonstrated  across  the  country  against 
right-wing  violence.  Following  the  violence  in  Molln,  the  gov- 
ernment began  a  crackdown  on  far-right  violence.  The  federal 
prosecutor  took  over  for  the  first  time  the  investigation  of  an 
antiforeigner  attack.  The  decision  was  made  to  charge  the  per- 
petrators with  murder,  rather  than  manslaughter,  as  had  been 
done  following  previous  arson  attacks  leading  to  fatalities.  In 
December  1993,  a  judge  imposed  maximum  sentences  on  the 
two  men  convicted  in  the  Molln  killings.  Other  measures  taken 
by  the  government  included  banning  four  small  neo-Nazi  orga- 
nizations and  outlawing  the  sale,  manufacture,  and  distribution 
of  the  music  of  several  neo-Nazi  rock  bands. 

Despite  the  government's  actions,  the  number  of  right-wing 
attacks  increased  in  the  first  six  months  of  1993.  The  most  seri- 
ous incident  occurred  on  May  29,  1993,  when  right-wing  youths 
firebombed  a  house  in  Solingen  in  western  Germany,  killing 
five  Turks.  In  late  December  1993,  four  right-wing  youths  were 
charged  with  murder  in  the  Solingen  attack.  In  late  October 
1993,  United  States  citizens  for  the  first  time  became  the  target 
of  right-wing  violence.  Two  skinheads  harassed  African-Ameri- 
can members  of  the  United  States  Olympic  luge  team,  which 
was  practicing  at  an  eastern  German  training  center.  When  a 
white  luger  intervened  on  his  teammates'  behalf,  he  was 
severely  beaten  by  the  skinheads. 

By  the  end  of  1993,  the  surge  in  right-wing  violence 
appeared  to  be  abating.  The  federal  police  reported  that,  in 
the  first  eleven  months  of  1993,  rightist  crime  dropped  by  28 
percent  compared  with  the  same  period  in  1992.  As  of  Decem- 
ber 2,  1993,  eight  people  had  died  in  rightist  violence  com- 
pared with  seventeen  in  1992.  A  police  spokesman  stated  that

Klaus  Kinkel,  paid  their  respects  in  Hamburg  to  the  memory  of  three

the  decline  reflected  decisive  executive  action,  including  faster 
police  responses,  tougher  sentences,  and  bans  on  neo-Nazi 
groups. 

Much  of  the  public  debate  on  how  to  address  the  causes  of 
right-wing  violence  has  focused  on  how  better  to  integrate  for- 
eigners into  German  society.  Chancellor  Kohl  announced 
some  steps  to  make  it  easier  for  foreigners  to  become  German 
citizens.  He  stopped  short,  however,  of  advocating  dual  citizen- 
ship. Concern  exists  in  law  enforcement  circles  that  neo-Nazis 
are  building  an  underground  network  of  small,  organized  cells 
patterned  in  part  on  those  of  the  Red  Army  Faction  (Rote 
Armee  Fraktion — RAF),  the  far-left  organization  that  carried 
out  bombings,  assassinations,  and  kidnappings  in  the  1970s 
and  1980s  (see  The  Student  Movement  and  Terrorism,  ch.  2; 


407 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Dissidence  and  Terrorist  Activity,  ch.  9).  The  establishment  of 
such  3.  network  would  make  it  much  more  difficult  for  the 
authorities  to  monitor  neo-Nazi  activities. 

A  final  issue  dominating  Germany's  political  scene  has  been 
the  ongoing  challenge  of  implementing  unification.  Among 
other  things,  the  two  Germanys  have  had  to  enact  uniform  leg- 
islation, decide  on  what  city  should  serve  as  their  capital,  and 
bring  the  former  leaders  of  East  Germany  to  justice. 

Unification  left  Germany  with  a  population  possessing 
widely  different  views  on  matters  such  as  the  family,  religion, 
and  the  work  ethic.  A  particularly  sensitive  issue  has  been  abor- 
tion. East  Germany,  which  permitted  free  abortion  on  demand 
up  to  the  twelfth  week  of  pregnancy,  had  a  markedly  more  lib- 
eral policy  on  abortion  than  did  West  Germany.  In  June  1992, 
the  Bundestag,  in  an  attempt  to  unify  abortion  policy, 
approved  an  abortion  law — opposed  by  Chancellor  Kohl — that 
granted  a  woman  the  right  to  an  abortion  up  to  the  twelfth 
week  of  pregnancy,  provided  she  accepted  counseling  first. 
Thirty-two  of  the  268  CDU  legislators,  primarily  from  eastern 
Germany,  broke  ranks  with  the  party  leadership  and  approved 
the  bill. 

On  August  4,  1992,  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court  issued 
an  injunction  against  the  parliament's  decision,  and  abortion 
continued  to  be  available  on  demand  in  the  east  and  largely 
prohibited  in  the  west,  pending  a  final  court  judgment.  On 
May  28,  1993,  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court  struck  down 
the  compromise  law  on  the  basis  of  the  Basic  Law's  explicit  pro- 
tection of  the  rights  of  the  unborn  child.  The  ruling  held  that 
abortion  was  no  longer  a  criminal  offense  but  that  abortions 
would  only  be  allowed  in  the  first  three  months  of  pregnancy 
for  women  who  first  participated  in  a  formal  consultation  pro- 
cess. Further,  the  ruling  barred  insurance  funds  from  paying 
for  abortions  and  Land  hospitals  from  performing  them.  The 
ruling  went  into  effect  on  June  16,  1993.  Women's  groups, 
opposition  politicians  from  the  west,  and  easterners  from 
across  the  political  spectrum  expressed  outrage  at  the  court's 
decision.  At  some  point  in  the  future,  the  Bundestag  is  still 
expected  to  pass  a  uniform  abortion  law  for  the  entire  country. 

Another  question  that  arose  with  unification  was  where  to 
locate  the  new  German  capital.  The  Bundestag  voted  in  June 
1991  to  move  the  capital  from  Bonn  to  Berlin,  fulfilling  a  long- 
standing promise  of  West  German  politicians  across  the  board. 
The  vote  in  favor  of  Berlin  was  surprisingly  narrow,  with  338 


408 


Government  and  Politics 


legislators  supporting  Berlin  and  320  supporting  Bonn.  Many 
of  the  parliamentarians  who  voted  for  Bonn  spoke  of  the  sym- 
bolic importance  of  the  capital's  geographical  location,  with 
Bonn  bearing  witness  to  the  critical  importance  of  the  Atlantic 
Alliance  and  Germany's  commitment  to  Western  democracy. 
Many  who  supported  Berlin  saw  their  choice  as  a  necessary  act 
of  conciliation  toward  eastern  Germans  and  a  necessary  step 
toward  Germany's  return  to  the  world  stage  as  a  "normal" 
nation. 

The  quick  move  to  Berlin  that  many  eastern  Germans  had 
hoped  for  was  thwarted  by  a  quiet,  yet  effective,  campaign  led 
by  Bonn  bureaucrats  and  certain  key  politicians  who  opposed 
the  Bundestag  decision  on  several  grounds.  First,  members  of 
this  group  cited  the  huge  expense  of  moving  the  government, 
estimated  at  just  under  US$19  billion  by  the  Ministry  of 
Finance.  Second,  they  argued  that  Berlin's  historical  associa- 
tions as  the  capital  of  a  united  Germany  were  negative  and  that 
Germany  should  avoid  doing  something  to  suggest  to  its  neigh- 
bors a  return  to  expansionist  or  aggressive  tendencies.  Third, 
many  officials  balked  at  the  personal  inconvenience  of  moving 
to  Berlin  if  they  owned  homes  in  the  Bonn  area  or  otherwise 
faced  having  to  uproot  their  families  from  the  rather  provincial 
Rhineland  and  relocate  in  a  booming  metropolis. 

After  two  years  of  indecision,  the  Kohl  cabinet  announced  in 
October  1993  that  the  government  would  complete  the  move 
to  Berlin  by  December  31,  2000;  the  move  will  begin  in  1998. 
The  opposition  Social  Democrats  had  threatened  to  make  the 
government's  reluctance  to  move  an  issue  in  the  1994  national 
election  campaign.  Foreign  embassies  and  private  companies 
had  delayed  their  moves  to  Berlin  while  waiting  for  an  official 
announcement  of  a  timetable.  The  cabinet  decision  sent  a 
decisive  message  to  investors  and  property  developers  who 
believed  the  move  would  attract  greater  investment  in  the  five 
eastern  Lander.  The  Bonn  lobby  won  certain  important  conces- 
sions as  well:  eight  government  ministries  will  keep  their  head- 
quarters in  Bonn,  and  the  remainder  will  retain  offices  there. 
Kohl  received  sharp  criticism  about  the  distant  deadline  from 
some  commentators,  who  argued  that  the  government's  hesita- 
tion to  complete  the  move  was  impeding  the  social  and  psycho- 
logical unification  of  east  and  west. 

Many  Germans  see  the  prosecution  of  former  East  German 
officials  as  a  necessary  part  of  coming  to  terms  with  divided 
Germany's  past.  On  November  12,  1992,  a  trial  opened  in  Ber- 


409 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

lin  involving  six  defendants,  including  former  East  German 
leader  Erich  Honecker,  former  minister  of  state  security  Erich 
Mielke,  and  former  prime  minister  Willi  Stoph.  These  men 
were  put  on  trial  for  the  killings  of  East  Germans  trying  to  cross 
the  border  to  the  west.  Two  days  later,  however,  Mielke  and 
Stoph  were  declared  unfit  to  stand  trial  for  health  reasons. 
Charges  were  then  dropped  against  Honecker  because  of  his 
advanced  cancer,  and  he  was  allowed  to  join  his  family  in  Chile 
in  early  1993.  The  remaining  three  defendants — all  former 
members  of  East  Germany's  National  Defense  Council — were 
convicted  in  September  1993,  receiving  prison  sentences  rang- 
ing from  four-and-one-half  years  to  seven-and-one-half  years. 

From  the  start,  the  legal  basis  for  the  trials  was  questionable. 
German  law  does  not  apply  to  acts  committed  by  East  German 
citizens  in  a  state  that  no  longer  exists.  Thus,  the  defendants 
had  to  be  prosecuted  for  transgressions  of  East  German  law, 
and  East  Germany's  border  law  allowed  guards  to  shoot  anyone 
trying  to  flee.  The  Berlin  prosecutors  argued  that  the  law  was 
evil  and  ought  not  to  have  been  obeyed,  a  form  of  reasoning 
with  which  the  judges  agreed.  Many  legal  scholars  believe  that 
the  convictions  could  be  reversed  on  appeal,  however.  In  part, 
the  prosecution  of  these  former  East  German  leaders  grew  out 
of  public  indignation  over  the  trials  of  border  guards  while 
senior  policy  makers  were  going  free.  By  late  1993,  ten  border 
guards  had  stood  trial.  Nine  received  short,  suspended  sen- 
tences or  acquittals;  one  received  a  sentence  of  six  years  for 
having  shot  and  killed  a  fugitive  who  had  already  been  caught 
and  was  under  arrest.  In  the  fall  of  1993,  the  Bundestag 
extended  the  statute  of  limitations  by  three  years  for  minor 
crimes  by  former  East  German  officials  and  by  five  years  for 
more  serious  crimes. 

Most  observers  of  Germany  believe  the  country  will  solve  the 
economic  and  political  challenges  associated  with  the  unifica- 
tion process.  However,  polls  indicated  that,  as  time  passed,  east- 
ern and  western  Germans  seemed  to  see  the  gap  between  them 
widening  rather  than  narrowing.  In  an  April  1993  poll,  when 
asked  whether  eastern  and  western  Germans  felt  solidarity  or 
antagonism  toward  one  another,  71  percent  in  the  west  and  85 
percent  in  the  east  answered  "antagonism."  In  the  coming 
years,  perhaps  the  greatest  challenge  to  Germans  of  the  east 
and  west  will  be  to  master  the  task  of  achieving  social  harmony. 
Only  then  can  they  become  one  nation.

GERMANYS  FOREIGN  POLICY  faces  formidable  challenges 
and  difficult  decisions.  For  forty  years,  Germany  was  divided 
between  East  and  West,  its  border  the  focus  of  a  nuclear  stand- 
off. On  October  3,  1990,  the  two  German  states,  the  Federal 
Republic  of  Germany  (FRG,  or  West  Germany)  and  the  Ger- 
man Democratic  Republic  (GDR,  or  East  Germany),  were 
united  under  one  democratic  government.  As  Germany  begins 
to  search  for  a  new  voice  abroad,  some  circles  fear  that  the 
country  might  once  again  come  to  dominate  the  continent. 

After  unification,  the  country  was  beset  by  difficult  domestic 
problems.  Integration  of  Germany's  five  new  eastern  states 
{Lander;  sing.,  Land)  proved  more  costly  and  time  consuming 
than  experts  had  originally  estimated.  In  addition,  there  was 
persistent  friction  between  the  former  West  Germans  ( Wessis  in 
colloquial  German)  and  the  former  East  Germans  (Ossis).  This 
friction  often  centered  on  the  costs  and  burdens  of  unification. 
A  spate  of  right-wing  radicalism  and  violence  also  erupted 
throughout  Germany,  primarily  directed  against  foreign  work- 
ers and  refugees.  Between  1990  and  mid-1995,  Germany  had 
taken  in  more  asylum-seekers  than  all  other  European  Union 
(EU — see  Glossary)  members  combined,  a  fact  that  angered 
some  Germans  because  of  the  expense  this  humanitarian 
action  entailed.  Finally,  there  was  a  debate  on  the  competitive- 
ness of  the  German  economy.  West  German  workers  had  come 
to  enjoy  some  of  the  highest  wages  and  most  extensive  benefits 
among  workers  anywhere  in  the  industrialized  world.  As  a 
result  of  high  labor  costs,  however,  companies  had  begun  to 
downsize,  and  many  were  relocating  production  facilities 
abroad.  Unemployment  was  increasing  throughout  Germany. 

In  this  context  of  domestic  preoccupation,  Germany  began 
to  confront  disorienting  external  circumstances  as  well.  The 
European  Community  (EC — see  Glossary)  had  embarked  on  a 
process  of  profound  change  as  it  considered  its  course  toward 
political  and  economic  union.  In  December  1991,  the  EC's 
twelve  members  signed  the  Treaty  on  European  Union  (com- 
monly known  as  the  Maastricht  Treaty — see  Glossary),  creating 
the  EU,  a  blueprint  for  unifying  the  continent.  The  United 
States,  previously  West  Germany's  most  important  ally,  began  to 
rethink  its  own  European  role  as  it  adapted  to  the  new 
post-Cold  War  environment  and  its  own  domestic  challenges.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Russia  and  the  other  states  of  the  former  Soviet  bloc  entered 
into  an  uncertain  relationship  of  dependence  on  Germany,  the 
country  that  led  the  international  aid  effort  for  the  emerging 
democracies  of  the  new  Europe. 

Meanwhile,  Operation  Desert  Storm  in  the  Persian  Gulf,  the 
humanitarian  mission  of  the  United  Nations  (UN)  in  Somalia, 
and  war  in  the  former  Yugoslavia  created  significant  challenges 
for  German  foreign  policy.  Germany's  policy  makers  were  con- 
fronted with  the  question  of  whether  or  not  their  country's  par- 
ticipation in  multilateral  actions  sanctioned  by  the  UN  would 
be  restricted  to  nonmilitary  or  peacekeeping  roles.  Would  Ger- 
many be  able  to  overcome  internal  legal  obstacles  and  psycho- 
logical inhibitions  stemming  from  its  turbulent  twentieth- 
century  history  of  militarism  to  participate  in  peace-enforcing 
combat  missions? 

Despite  initial  reluctance  and  arduous  debate,  Germany's 
foreign  policy  planners  began  to  accept  a  new  role  with  regard 
to  Germany's  military,  and  incremental  steps  were  taken  to  nor- 
malize the  use  of  the  country's  armed  forces.  The  German  navy 
patrolled  the  eastern  Mediterranean  off  the  coasts  of  Egypt 
and  Syria  during  the  Persian  Gulf  War  in  1991.  From  May  1991 
to  October  1993,  German  military  personnel  served  with  UN 
forces  in  Cambodia.  In  March  1994,  German  troops  joined  the 
UN's  operation  in  Somalia.  German  Alpha  Jets  were  deployed 
in  eastern  Turkey  to  help  enforce  the  UN's  Kurdish  safe  zone 
in  northern  Iraq.  And  German  pilots  flew  North  Atlantic 
Treaty  Organization  (NATO — see  Glossary)  missions  over  Bos- 
nia as  part  of  the  UN's  "Deny  Flight"  operation.  By  the 
mid-1990s,  the  chief  legal  obstacles  to  the  deployment  of  Ger- 
man armed  forces  abroad  had  been  overcome,  but  the  "nor- 
malization" of  German  foreign  policy,  it  had  become  clear, 
would  still  take  some  time. 

Once  unified,  Germany  struggled  to  think  clearly  about  its 
national  priorities.  For  Germans,  unification  meant  new  bor- 
ders, new  resources,  and  a  return  to  the  center  of  the  conti- 
nent, or  Mittellage.  It  also  meant  new  responsibilities  and  new 
expectations.  Historically,  Germany  had  often  been  either  too 
strong  or  too  weak  to  be  accepted  by  its  neighbors. 

Germany's  return  to  the  center  of  Europe  entailed  for  the 
country's  foreign  policy  establishment  the  beginnings  of  a  sub- 
tle recalculation  of  the  country's  national  interests  and  a  grad- 
ual reexamination  of  its  relationship  to  a  number  of 
international  bodies.  Those  bodies  included  NATO,  the  EU, 


416 


Foreign  Relations 


the  Western  European  Union  (WEU — see  Glossary);  the  Con- 
ference on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE — see 
Glossary) — which  was  renamed  the  Organization  for  Security 
and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (OSCE — see  Glossary)  in  January 
1995 — and  the  UN.  In  the  early  post-Cold  War  years,  Germany 
had  assumed  a  leading  role  in  advocating  the  expansion  of 
NATO  and  the  EU  to  include  emerging  democracies  of  Central 
and  Eastern  Europe. 

Although  German  foreign  policy  remains  deeply  influenced 
by  patterns  of  behavior  developed  during  the  Cold  War,  uni- 
fied Germany's  major  foreign  policies  and  goals  are  evolving. 
During  the  unification  process,  Germany  had  reaffirmed  its 
pledge  not  to  acquire  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  But  post- 
unification  Germany  also  made  clear  its  interest  in  obtaining  a 
permanent  seat  on  the  UN  Security  Council.  Foreign  observers 
and  Germans  alike  had  begun  the  search  for  answers  to  emerg- 
ing questions.  What  will  it  mean  for  Germany  to  be  a  "sover- 
eign nation"  again?  Will  German  attempts  of  the  past  four 
decades  to  develop  a  postnational,  European  identity  begin  to 
fade,  or  will  they  be  reinforced  in  this  postunification  era? 
What  role  will  Germany  play  in  Europe  as  well  as  globally?  Will 
Germany  dominate  Europe  again,  and,  if  so,  in  what  way?  How 
will  the  new  Germany,  still  carrying  burdens  from  the  past, 
define  its  national  interest  in  the  future? 

Major  Foreign  Policy  Goals  and  Strategies 

Early  Developments 

Imperial  Germany's  foreign  policy,  from  Otto  von  Bismarck's 
founding  of  the  empire  in  1871  until  the  empire's  collapse  at 
the  end  of  World  War  I,  was  influenced  by  the  country's 
exposed  geographical  situation,  Germany's  Mittellage,  as  well  as 
by  domestic  difficulties.  Looking  abroad,  German  policy  mak- 
ers were  often  obsessed  with  the  threat  of  encirclement  (Ein- 
kreisung)  by  hostile  neighbor  states.  Thus,  after  1871  German 
foreign  policy  objectives  centered  on  two  principal  tasks:  to 
keep  France,  Germany's  historical  rival  and  enemy,  isolated; 
and  to  balance  the  other  major  powers  of  the  day  in  order  to 
ensure  that  no  single  power  would  be  able  to  exert  pressure  or 
militarily  confront  the  newly  united  German  state. 

"Modern  Germany  was  born  encircled,"  writes  David  P.  Cal- 
leo,  a  noted  foreign  affairs  specialist.  Indeed,  German  leaders 
of  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries  were  often 


417 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

concerned  with  their  country's  vulnerability.  They  were  preoc- 
cupied with  national  frontiers  and  responded  to  this  preoccu- 
pation with  a  heavy  emphasis  on  military  power.  Yet  the 
international  policy,  or  Weltpolitik,  of  Bismarck  (1862-90)  and 
Kaiser  Wilhelm  II  (r.  1888-1918)  differed  little  from  that  of 
other  major  European  powers  of  the  day,  such  as  Britain  or 
France.  But  Germany  would  come  to  fight  and  lose  two  world 
wars  in  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth  century.  And  the  disas- 
trous consequences  of  German  militarism  and  the  barbaric 
actions  of  Nazi  Germany,  in  particular,  had  a  profound  impact 
on  the  development  of  West  Germany's  foreign  policy  between 
1949  and  1989. 

At  first  glance,  the  situation  facing  united  Germany  in  the 
1990s  resembles  the  situation  faced  by  imperial  Germany,  inso- 
far as  Germany  has  reclaimed  a  Mittellage  and  has  returned  geo- 
graphically to  the  heart  of  the  continent  (surrounded  by  nine 
immediate  neighbors).  Yet  the  parallel  ends  there.  Peaceful 
relations  exist  between  Germany  and  bordering  states.  Like 
Germany,  the  country's  neighbors  are  democratic.  Relations 
between  Germany  and  these  neighbors  are  characterized  not 
by  confrontation  but  by  economic  cooperation  and  interde- 
pendence. In  the  first  years  following  unification,  there  was  no 
dispute  about  continued  German  membership  in  NATO.  And 
Germany  remains  a  faithful  member  of  the  EU — even  as  Ger- 
man policy  makers  have  begun  to  reexamine  their  country's 
foreign  policy  and  to  search  for  a  new  hierarchy  of  German 
interests  in  Europe. 

Postwar  Developments 

In  the  postwar  period,  the  Federal  Republic  became  known 
as  "an  economic  giant"  and  a  "political  dwarf."  During  the  Cold 
War,  German  foreign  policy  had  been  formulated  under 
extraordinary  circumstances.  After  World  War  II,  the  country 
was  divided,  and  its  sovereignty  was  limited.  As  a  member  of  the 
Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary),  communist  East  Germany's  foreign 
policy  was  closely  aligned  with  that  of  the  Soviet  Union.  West 
Germany's  foreign  policy  became  characterized  by  a  penchant 
for  political  and  economic  power  over  military  power,  by  its 
preference  for  multilateralism  over  the  exercise  of  unilateral 
actions,  and  by  its  concentration  on  European  rather  than  glo- 
bal policy  issues. 

The  characteristics  of  West  Germany  as  a  civilian  European 
power  wedded  to  multilateral  structures  stood  in  stark  contrast 


418 


Foreign  Relations 


to  German  colonialism  of  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twenti- 
eth centuries  and  the  military  expansion  pursued  by  Germany 
under  Adolf  Hitler's  National  Socialist  rule  from  1933  to  1945. 
In  fact,  the  patterns  of  West  Germany's  foreign  policy  were  very 
much  a  direct  consequence  of  military  defeat  and  occupation 
by  the  Allied  Powers  at  the  end  of  World  War  II.  In  reaction  to 
the  excesses  of  the  past,  the  Federal  Republic's  foreign  policy 
establishment  developed  a  clear  and  strong  aversion  to  power 
politics  and  remained  reluctant  to  draw  on  populist,  national 
sentiment  in  support  of  foreign  policy  goals. 

Emblematic  of  West  Germany's  foreign  policy  was  Bonn's 
Ostpolitik — the  opening  to  the  east  that  became  a  continuous, 
albeit  varied,  thread  in  the  policies  practiced  by  both  center- 
left  and  center-right  governments  in  Bonn  over  the  two 
decades  preceding  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  bloc.  Ostpolitik 
began  in  1969,  when  Germany's  coalition  formed  by  the  Social 
Democratic  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialdemokratische  Partei 
Deutschlands — SPD)  and  the  Free  Democratic  Party  (Freie 
Demokratische  Partei — FDP)  first  took  office.  Ostpolitik  was 
the  result  of  a  concept  known  as  Wandel  durch  Anndherung,  or 
change  through  rapprochement,  created  by  Chancellor  Willy 
Brandt  (1969-74)  and  his  close  adviser,  Egon  Bahr. 

Ostpolitik  was  Bonn's  policy  of  detente  toward  communist 
Europe.  It  rested  on  two  assumptions:  that  the  Federal  Repub- 
lic, despite  the  crimes  subsequently  committed  by  communist 
regimes,  had  a  special  responsibility  to  compensate  Eastern 
Europe  for  the  aggression  and  atrocities  carried  out  by  Nazi 
Germany;  and  that  a  web  of  treaties  and  agreements  with  the 
Soviet  bloc  would  improve  human  rights  for  the  citizens  of 
these  neighboring  communist  states,  while  creating  a 
peace-inducing  dialogue  with  communist  regimes.  Conse- 
quently, Ostpolitik  consisted  of  three  components:  West  Ger- 
many's relations  with  the  Soviet  Union,  its  ties  to  East  Germany, 
and  its  dealings  with  the  rest  of  Eastern  Europe.  In  the  case  of 
East  Germany,  Ostpolitik  represented  Bonn's  attempt  through 
dialogue  and  cooperation  with  communist  rulers  to  help  over- 
come some  of  the  burdens  of  Germany's  division. 

Unification 

On  November  28,  1989,  three  weeks  after  the  breach  of  the 
Berlin  Wall,  Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl  (1982-  )  presented  to  the 
Bundestag  (the  lower  house  of  West  Germany's  parliament)  his 
Ten-Point  Plan  outlining  his  proposal  for  the  incremental  cre- 


419 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

ation  of  a  confederation  between  the  two  German  states.  Kohl 
believed  at  the  time — an  overly  optimistic  assessment  as  history 
would  soon  show — that  the  process  of  internal  economic  unifi- 
cation could  be  achieved  in  three  to  four  years. 

There  was  much  talk  at  the  time  that  in  presenting  his 
Ten-Point  Plan  Chancellor  Kohl  was  engaging  in  an  overly 
assertive  style  of  diplomacy  because  he  had  failed  to  adequately 
consult  his  partners  within  the  governing  coalition  as  well  as 
the  Western  Allies.  A  number  of  leading  members  of  the  oppo- 
sition SPD,  moreover,  rejected  the  idea  of  unification,  viewing 
moves  toward  unity  as  a  threat  to  the  postwar  order  of  peace 
and  stability  in  Europe.  The  initial  push  by  the  Kohl  govern- 
ment toward  unification  was  driven  by  a  number  of  consider- 
ations. 

Kohl  feared  that  if  Bonn  were  not  able  to  immediately  set 
the  terms  and  course  of  international  discussion  about  events 
in  East  Germany,  other  European  countries,  particularly  the 
Soviet  Union  and  France,  might  seek  a  new  variation  on  the 
most  recent  solution  of  the  "German  Question,"  namely, 
arranging  for  the  containment  of  Germany  within  Europe's 
international  order  by  dividing  it  into  two.  French  president 
Francois  Mitterrand's  announcement  of  his  intention  to  visit 
East  Berlin  just  days  prior  to  Kohl's  Bundestag  speech,  for 
instance,  fueled  fears  in  Bonn  that  anxious  neighbors  might 
attempt  to  stabilize  East  Germany's  fragile  communist  regime 
and  its  hemorrhaging  economy. 

There  were  domestic  considerations  for  West  Germany's 
chancellor  as  well.  Kohl  worried  that  if  his  party,  the  Christian 
Democratic  Union  (Christlich  Demokratische  Union — CDU), 
did  not  seize  the  issue  of  unification  and  articulate  a  bold  plan 
of  action,  political  opponents  might  step  in  to  fill  the  vacuum. 
Kohl's  rivals  included  the  SPD,  but  also  the  FDP,  the  junior 
partner  in  Kohl's  coalition  government,  in  power  since  late 
1982.  West  Germany's  federal  president,  Richard  von 
Weizsacker  (1984-94),  a  member  of  Kohl's  party,  feared  that 
the  right-wing  radical  Republikaner  (Die  Republikaner)  could 
make  the  issue  their  own  in  the  upcoming  national  election 
campaign  if  the  CDU  did  not  preempt  it. 

It  also  had  become  clear  within  weeks  of  Kohl's  proposed 
Ten-Point  Plan  that  governing  elites  would  be  forced  to 
respond  to  overwhelming  pressure  from  the  streets  of  East  Ger- 
man cities  and  towns.  The  ways  in  which  Kohl  later  defended 
the  terms  and  timing  of  economic  and  monetary  union  with 


420 


Foreign  Relations 


East  Germany  illustrate  this  fact.  He  often  reminded  his  critics 
that  if  Bonn  were  not  prepared  to  bring  the  deutsche  mark  to 
East  Germany,  the  East  Germans  would  surely  come  to  the 
deutsche  mark,  an  allusion  to  the  growing  tide  of  East-West 
migration  during  the  first  six  months  of  1990. 

Chancellor  Kohl's  Ten-Point  Plan  sought  to  intensify  rap- 
prochement with  East  Germany.  The  ten  points  consisted  of 
calling  for  immediate  measures  to  provide  aid;  cooperation 
with  the  GDR  on  an  economic  and  cultural  level;  fundamental 
political  and  economic  change  in  the  GDR;  a  close-knit  net- 
work of  agreements;  confederative  structures,  with  the  goal  of 
forming  a  federation  in  Germany;  a  future  structure  of  Ger- 
many that  would  fit  into  the  future  architecture  of  Europe  as  a 
whole;  the  power  of  attraction  of  the  EC  to  remain  a  constant 
feature;  the  continuation  of  the  CSCE  process  as  a  crucial  part 
of  the  total  European  architecture,  but  with  the  possibility  of 
new  institutional  forms;  disarmament  and  arms  control  to  keep 
step  with  political  developments;  and  freedom  within  Europe 
to  be  maintained  in  such  a  way  that  the  German  people  could, 
via  self-determination,  restore  their  unity.  The  reattainment  of 
German  state  unity  by  peaceful  means  remained  the  political 
goal  of  the  federal  government. 

In  fact,  East  Germany  disintegrated  at  an  astonishing  pace, 
and  German  foreign  policy  from  late  1989  throughout  1990 
was  driven  by  concerns  directly  related  to  the  unification  pro- 
cess. In  February  1990,  East  Germany's  communist  party,  the 
Socialist  Unity  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialistische  Einheitspartei 
Deutschlands — SED),  transformed  itself  into  the  Party  of  Dem- 
ocratic Socialism  (Partei  des  Demokratischen  Sozialismus — 
PDS).  East  Germany's  new  prime  minister,  Hans  Modrow, 
insisted  that  the  reformed  PDS  would  be  able  to  find  a  "third 
way"  between  capitalism  and  socialism,  permitting  the  GDR 
another  life  as  a  separate  independent  German  state.  Democ- 
ratization and  elections  in  May  1990  would  legitimate  the  PDS's 
leading  role  in  this  process,  Modrow  believed,  and  would  pro- 
vide a  new  basis  for  relations  between  East  Germany  and  West 
Germany. 

The  plans  of  East  German  reform  communists  were  derailed 
in  a  matter  of  months,  however.  Discredited  SED  officials  were 
publicly  harassed  and  in  some  cases  arrested  for  abuse  of 
power  and  privilege.  The  leading  role  of  the  communist  party 
was  revoked  from  the  GDR's  constitution,  and  offices  of  the 
State  Security  Service  (Staatssicherheitsdienst,  commonly 


421 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

referred  to  as  Stasi),  the  despised  secret  police,  were  occupied 
by  citizens  groups  at  sites  throughout  the  country.  Of  the  SED's 
2.3  million  members,  nearly  1.6  million  had  deserted  by  early 
1990. 

By  the  end  of  January  1990,  a  deteriorating  economy,  sus- 
tained demonstrations  throughout  the  country,  and  the  daily 
exit  of  some  2,000  East  German  citizens  for  West  Germany 
compelled  opposition  leaders  who  made  up  the  Round  Table, 
an  interim  "government,"  to  convince  Modrow  to  advance  the 
date  of  East  German  elections  from  May  6  to  March  18.  By  late 
spring,  most  observers  agreed  that  the  elections  would  no 
longer  be  a  referendum  on  communist  rule  (opinion  polls  sug- 
gested that  the  communists  would  be  defeated  in  fair,  free  elec- 
tions), but  rather  on  the  terms  and  timing  of  German 
unification. 

Confronted  by  this  reality,  Soviet  leader  Mikhail  Gorbachev, 
having  previously  insisted  that  Moscow  would  not  accept  aboli- 
tion of  the  East  German  state,  retreated  from  this  hard-line 
position.  Although  Gorbachev  had  renounced  the  Soviet 
Union's  right  to  determine  the  national  policies  of  Warsaw  Pact 
members  during  the  years  and  months  prior  to  the  breach  of 
the  Berlin  Wall,  the  Soviet  leadership  had  remained  steadfastly 
committed  to  the  overall  status  quo  in  Europe  and  to  Ger- 
many's division  into  two  states. 

As  the  Berlin  Wall  collapsed  and  Kohl  announced  his 
Ten-Point  Plan,  the  Soviet  leadership  delivered  a  number  of 
statements  and  gestures  that  made  it  clear  that  Moscow  had  no 
intention  of  relinquishing  its  East  German  ally.  Reasserting 
occupation  rights,  the  Soviet  Union  called  for  a  meeting  of  the 
ambassadors  of  the  World  War  II  Allies,  which  took  place  on 
December  11  at  the  Allied  Control  Council  building  in  Berlin. 
A  stream  of  Kremlin  advisers  insisted  in  interviews  that  unifica- 
tion was  neither  desirable  nor  feasible. 

Nevertheless,  on  January  30  Prime  Minister  Modrow  flew  to 
Moscow  for  a  meeting  with  Gorbachev,  after  which  Gorbachev 
consented  in  principle  to  Germany's  self-determination.  When 
Modrow  returned  to  East  Berlin,  he  announced  his  own  plan 
for  inner-German  rapprochement,  a  "Declaration  on  the  Way 
to  German  Unity."  The  plan  envisaged  a  confederation 
between  the  two  German  states,  leading  eventually  to  an 
all-German  federation.  According  to  the  plan,  both  Bonn  and 
East  Berlin  would  gradually  distance  themselves  from  their 
respective  alliance  commitments.

Foreign  Relations 


In  a  speech  delivered  in  West  Berlin  on  December  12, 
United  States  secretary  of  state  James  Baker,  echoing  the  posi- 
tion outlined  by  United  States  president  George  Bush  in  a 
meeting  with  Chancellor  Kohl  earlier  that  month,  had  already 
tacitly  given  Washington's  green  light  for  German  unity. 
Although  the  French  and  British  gradually  overcame  initial 
misgivings,  Baker,  and  later  Kohl  and  West  German  minister  of 
foreign  affairs  Hans-Dietrich  Genscher,  visited  Gorbachev  in 
February  to  further  assuage  Soviet  security  concerns.  In  a 
meeting  with  Gorbachev,  Baker  formally  presented  what 
became  known  as  the  Nine  Assurances,  a  collection  of  various 
Western  guarantees  provided  to  the  Soviet  Union  to  make  the 
process  of  German  unification  more  palatable. 

Meanwhile,  pressured  by  fears  that  East  Germany  might  col- 
lapse (and  by  the  conviction  that  the  opportunity  to  unite  the 
two  German  states  would  exist  only  as  long  as  Gorbachev 
remained  in  power),  the  Kohl  government  began  to  push  dip- 
lomatic negotiations  toward  a  speedy  solution  of  the  German 
Question.  Kohl's  Ten-Point  Plan  was  being  overtaken  by  events. 

Already  in  the  beginning  of  February,  discussions  had  begun 
about  the  introduction  of  West  Germany's  currency  into  East 
Germany.  Also  as  a  result  of  the  quickened  pace  of  events,  the 
foreign  ministers  of  the  four  World  War  II  Allies  and  of  the  two 
German  states  agreed  in  mid-February  to  begin  formal  talks  on 
German  unity  (the  Two-Plus-Four  Talks).  The  external  condi- 
tions for  unification  were  put  into  place. 

The  Two-Plus-Four  Talks  were  intended  to  provide  an  instru- 
ment with  which  to  shape  German  unification  and  hence  the 
new  post-Cold  War  world  in  Europe  without  excluding  key 
players  from  the  process.  There  were  fears,  in  particular  in 
Washington  and  Bonn,  that  a  bitter  sense  of  defeat  and  exclu- 
sion in  Moscow  might  engender  a  climate  analogous  to  that 
which  had  developed  in  Germany  after  the  Treaty  of  Versailles 
and  that  had  characterized  the  Weimar  period.  The  existence 
of  a  humiliated  and  vanquished  power  that  might  later  seek  to 
forcibly  reshape  the  European  order  (as  Hitler's  Germany  had 
sought  to  do)  was  to  be  precluded  at  all  costs.  More  immedi- 
ately, United  States,  German,  and  other  West  European  diplo- 
mats wanted  to  avoid  creating  a  domestic  crisis  for  Gorbachev, 
to  whom  most  Western  leaders  had  tied  their  hopes  for  a  sus- 
tained liberal  posture  of  the  Soviet  Union. 

Free  and  fair  elections  for  East  Germany's  Volkskammer 
(People's  Chamber)  were  held  on  March  18,  1990.  The  result 


423 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

was  a  victory  for  the  CDU-led  Alliance  for  Germany,  which 
received  a  plurality  of  the  vote.  The  alliance  and  the  other  par- 
ties that  supported  unification  (the  SPD,  the  Alliance  of  Free 
Democrats,  and  the  German  Social  Union)  received  the  votes 
of  roughly  three-fourths  of  the  East  German  electorate.  Opin- 
ion polls  underscored  the  same  message  expressed  in  the  elec- 
tion results.  The  vast  majority  of  the  population  in  the  GDR 
rejected  communism,  reformed  or  otherwise,  and  supported 
unification  with  the  Federal  Republic. 

East  Germany's  first  (and  last)  democratically  elected  prime 
minister,  Lothar  de  Maiziere,  promptly  fulfilled  his  mandate. 
On  April  19,  he  announced  that  he  would  seek  unity  with  West 
Germany  as  soon  as  possible.  As  a  first  step,  East  Berlin's  new 
government  agreed  with  Bonn  on  economic  and  monetary 
union,  which  took  place  on  July  1. 

The  external  conditions  governing  Germany's  unification 
had  meanwhile  been  in  process.  Following  the  first  Two-Plus- 
Four  meeting  in  mid-February,  subsequent  meetings  were  held 
in  March,  June,  July,  and  September  1990.  In  late  June,  the 
national  legislatures  in  East  Berlin  and  in  Bonn  approved  a  res- 
olution recognizing  the  inviolability  of  Poland's  borders  as 
determined  after  World  War  II,  confirming  the  Oder-Neisse 
rivers  as  the  permanent  border  between  Poland  and  the  future 
united  Germany.  On  August  31,  1990,  the  Unification  Treaty 
was  signed  in  East  Berlin  by  officials  of  both  German  states. 
The  treaty  stipulated  that  the  five  newly  reconstituted  Lander  in 
the  GDR  would  accede  to  the  Federal  Republic  on  October  3, 
1990,  as  provided  for  under  Article  23  of  the  Basic  Law. 

The  remaining  external  aspects  relating  to  German  unifica- 
tion were  quickly  settled.  After  having  consented  to  unification, 
Gorbachev  and  his  foreign  minister,  Eduard  Shevardnadze, 
had  at  first  insisted  that  united  Germany  accept  a  demilita- 
rized, neutral  status.  When  this  was  rejected  by  West  Germany, 
they  then  argued  that  Germany  should  remain  in  both  NATO 
and  the  Warsaw  Pact  for  a  transitional  period.  In  this  context, 
GDR  minister  of  national  defense  Admiral  Theodor  Hoffmann 
proposed  in  late  February  1990  the  creation  of  a  joint  army  for 
united  Germany  (a  force  that  would  be  reduced  to  less  than 
one-third  the  combined  size  of  the  armed  forces  of  the  FRG 
and  the  GDR) .  He  also  proposed  that,  pending  elections  and 
further  negotiations,  both  states  continue  to  belong  to  their 
respective  alliances. 


424 


Foreign  Relations 


That  same  month,  however,  following  a  meeting  at  Camp 
David,  Chancellor  Kohl  and  President  Bush  had  reemphasized 
their  commitment  to  unified  Germany's  full  membership  in 
NATO.  They  stressed  that  East  Germany  would  initially  enjoy  a 
special  military  status  in  deference  to  security  concerns  of  the 
Soviet  Union.  To  this  end,  West  German  minister  of  foreign 
affairs  Genscher,  especially  attuned  to  Soviet  sensitivities,  had 
formulated  a  plan  to  assuage  Soviet  concerns.  According  to 
Genscher's  plan,  NATO  forces  would  not  be  moved  to  the  terri- 
tory of  the  former  GDR. 

In  the  early  weeks  of  the  spring  of  1990,  Soviet  resistance  to 
united  Germany's  full  membership  in  NATO,  particularly  in 
light  of  the  GDR's  elections  in  March,  became  increasingly 
untenable.  Finally,  in  mid-July,  consultations  among  Kohl, 
Genscher,  and  Gorbachev  in  the  Caucasian  town  of  Stavropol 
secured  Soviet  permission  for  Germany  to  enjoy  full  sover- 
eignty and  remain  in  NATO. 

A  communique  issued  by  NATO  from  London  the  previous 
week  had  helped  to  facilitate  the  reversal  of  the  Soviet  position 
as  did  West  German  largesse  to  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  form  of 
aid  and  credits.  The  London  declaration  announced  that 
NATO  had  become  "an  indispensable  factor  of  stability"  for 
Europe's  profound  transition  and  hence  would  seek  to  extend 
the  Alliance's  "hand  of  friendship"  to  its  former  enemies  in  the 
Soviet  Union  and  Eastern  Europe. 

Kohl  and  Genscher  agreed  that  united  Germany  would 
recommit  to  earlier  pledges  to  renounce  production  and  pos- 
session of  nuclear,  biological,  and  chemical  weapons.  Both  Ger- 
man states  also  declared  on  August  30,  1990,  at  the  Conven- 
tional Forces  in  Europe  (CFE)  talks  in  Vienna,  that  the  united 
country  would  reduce  its  armed  forces  to  370,000  within  three 
to  four  years.  West  Germany's  leadership  also  guaranteed  that 
NATO's  military  organization  would  not  be  extended  to  GDR 
territory  as  long  as  Soviet  forces  remained  stationed  there.  In 
return,  Kohl  obtained  from  Gorbachev  agreement  that  the 
roughly  400,000  Soviet  troops  stationed  in  East  Germany  would 
be  withdrawn  by  the  end  of  1994.  The  Kohl  government  also 
pledged  financial  assistance  for  the  repatriation  of  the  Soviet 
troops. 

The  Kohl-Gorbachev  agreements  paved  the  way  for  signing 
the  Treaty  on  the  Final  Settlement  with  Respect  to  Germany, 
or,  as  it  is  more  commonly  known,  the  Two-Plus-Four  Treaty,  on 
September  12,  1990.  Within  this  framework,  the  two  German 


425 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

states,  together  with  the  United  States,  the  Soviet  Union, 
France,  and  Britain,  were  able  to  confirm  the  unification  of 
Germany  as  consisting  of  the  GDR,  the  FRG,  and  Berlin.  In 
addition,  the  Federal  Republic  and  the  Soviet  Union  signed  a 
Treaty  on  Good-Neighborliness,  Partnership,  and  Cooperation 
in  September  1990.  That  same  month,  the  GDR's  minister  of 
defense  and  disarmament  and  the  commander  in  chief  of  the 
Warsaw  Pact's  armed  forces  concluded  an  agreement  that  pro- 
vided for  the  GDR's  immediate  withdrawal  from  the  Warsaw 
Pact. 

Bonn  and  Warsaw  also  concluded  a  separate  treaty  that  took 
into  account  the  special  concerns  Poland  had  about  its  security. 
For  a  period  of  time,  the  topic  of  the  German-Polish  border 
had  proved  a  controversial  and  divisive  issue  for  coalition  poli- 
tics in  Bonn  and  for  the  unification  process  in  general.  Kohl's 
reluctance  to  declare  the  issue  settled,  stemming  from  legal 
concerns  as  well  as  domestic  political  considerations,  fueled 
anxieties  in  Poland  and  elsewhere  in  Europe  about  the  course 
of  a  united  Germany.  On  June  21,  1990,  however,  both  German 
parliaments  had  passed  resolutions  recognizing  Poland's  west- 
ern border  as  final,  stipulating  that  a  separate  treaty  between 
Poland  and  a  united  Germany  would  formally  consummate 
this  understanding. 

On  October  1,  1990,  all  Four-Power  rights  in  Germany  and 
Berlin  ended  when  representatives  of  the  four  victorious  coun- 
tries in  World  War  II  signed  a  document  in  New  York  recogniz- 
ing full  German  sovereignty.  On  October  3,  the  Unification 
Treaty  went  into  effect,  and  the  five  new  Lander  formed  in  the 
territory  of  the  former  GDR  acceded  to  the  Federal  Republic 
as  provided  for  under  Article  23  of  the  Basic  Law. 

Foreign  Reaction  to  Unification 

German  unification  upset  the  political  equilibrium  in  many 
of  Western  and  Eastern  Europe's  political  establishments. 
Although  French  public  opinion  had  tended  to  support  Ger- 
man unity,  French  leaders  feared  that  a  resurgent  united  Ger- 
many would  dominate  Europe  and  usurp  their  aspirations  to 
play  a  leading  role  on  the  continent.  President  Mitterrand's 
trip  to  the  GDR  in  December  1989,  when  he  cautioned  the  East 
Germans  against  hasty  unification,  illustrated  this  sentiment. 

In  Britain,  Prime  Minister  Margaret  Thatcher's  government 
harbored  fears  that  German  unification  would  accelerate  Euro- 
pean unification,  quickening  and  deepening  the  gap  between

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

London  and  the  continent.  Nicholas  Ridley,  an  official  in  the 
Thatcher  government,  was  forced  to  step  down  in  the  summer 
of  1990  in  the  wake  of  impolitic  remarks  he  made  about  Euro- 
pean economic  union's  being  a  German  design  for  the  domi- 
nation of  Europe.  Thatcher,  for  her  part,  initially  urged 
Chancellor  Kohl's  government  to  be  patient  on  unification  and 
only  with  reluctance  later  joined  the  United  States  in  its  pro- 
unity  stance. 

In  the  former  Soviet  bloc,  aside  from  the  Soviet  Union, 
Poland  sheltered  the  greatest  distrust  and  suspicion  of  develop- 
ments in  Germany.  These  anxieties  accounted  for  the  separate 
treaty  signed  between  united  Germany  and  Poland  in  Novem- 
ber 1990.  The  treaty  confirmed  the  border  (stipulated  in  the 
Two-Plus-Four  Talks)  and  also  outlined  principles  for 
good-neighborliness  and  cooperation  between  Warsaw  and 
Bonn. 

From  the  United  States  perspective,  after  offering  Germany 
support  for  unification,  President  Bush  promptly  sought  to 
reshape  the  German-United  States  alliance  from  a  relationship 
in  which  West  Germany  had  served  as  a  junior  partner  to  a 
more  equal  status  in  which  Germany  would  become  a  "partner 
in  leadership."  Germany's  changing  relationship  with  the 
United  States  was  in  fact  already  evident.  For  example,  it  was 
without  prior  consultation  with  Washington  that  Chancellor 
Kohl  and  Soviet  president  Gorbachev  had  reached  their  agree- 
ment on  the  limit  of  370,000  troops  for  Germany's  armed 
forces,  the  Bundeswehr  (West  Germany  had  roughly  495,000 
troops  under  arms  in  1990;  the  GDR,  170,000)  and  the  exclu- 
sion of  NATO  troops  from  the  territory  of  eastern  Germany. 

Postunification  Developments 

United  Germany,  a  state  with  80  million  inhabitants  and  an 
area  bordering  nine  countries  in  Central  Europe,  confronted  a 
daunting  array  of  responsibilities  and  expectations  with  regard 
to  its  international  role  in  the  early  1990s.  Following  unifica- 
tion, its  government  adopted  a  policy  aimed  at  fully  integrating 
the  newly  enlarged  Federal  Republic  into  the  primary  instru- 
ments of  international  cooperation:  the  EC,  NATO,  the  WEU, 
and  the  CSCE.  In  a  deliberate  effort  to  further  assuage  the  con- 
cerns of  its  neighbors  about  German  dominance  on  the  conti- 
nent, Bonn  worked  assiduously  to  bolster  its  multilateralist 
image. 


428 


Foreign  Relations 


President  von  Weizsacker,  Chancellor  Kohl,  and  Minister  of 
Foreign  Affairs  Genscher  all  went  to  great  lengths  to  stress  Ger- 
many's intention  to  renounce  the  power  politics  of  past  eras  in 
favor  of  a  "policy  of  responsibility."  In  the  German  view,  this 
meant,  on  the  one  hand,  a  continuation  of  West  German  for- 
eign policy  based  on  the  use  of  nonmilitary  instruments.  On 
the  other  hand,  it  meant  a  higher  international  profile  in  eco- 
nomic, human  rights,  and  environmental  issues.  With  the  end 
of  the  Cold  War,  economic  power,  in  the  view  of  many  officials 
and  policy  experts  in  Europe,  had  superseded  military  power 
in  terms  of  political  influence.  Germans,  above  all,  adhered  to 
this  belief. 

At  times,  however,  German  foreign  policy  was  self-centered. 
Squabbling  over  German  interest  rates  (both  in  Europe  and  in 
the  United  States)  in  the  autumn  of  1992  underscored  what 
many  perceived  as  a  new  tilt  toward  German  self-absorption 
and  unilateralism  that  had  been  established  the  previous  win- 
ter through  Germany's  policy  toward  the  Balkans.  Until  the 
summer  of  1991,  Germany's  policy  toward  Yugoslavia  had  mir- 
rored the  thinking  in  Washington  and  European  capitals, 
namely,  that  Yugoslav  unity  should  be  preserved.  For  a  number 
of  domestic  reasons,  however,  Bonn  began  to  shift  away  from 
this  policy,  finally  deciding  on  unilateral  recognition  of  Croatia 
and  Slovenia  in  December  1991. 

In  general,  united  Germany's  foreign  policy  followed  the  res- 
olutely multilateral  stance  developed  in  the  postwar  period. 
The  German  government  played  an  enthusiastic  role  in  the 
environmental  summit  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  June  1992,  empha- 
sizing the  importance  it  attached  to  international  ecological 
concerns  in  its  foreign  policy.  In  the  area  of  international  aid, 
Bonn  established  criteria  for  developmental  assistance  based 
on  a  recipient  country's  respect  for  human  rights,  commitment 
to  democracy  and  a  market  economy,  and  responsibility  in 
arms  development  and  procurement. 

In  the  first  years  after  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  bloc,  Ger- 
many led  the  international  aid  effort  for  the  former  Soviet 
Union  and  for  the  countries  of  Central  and  Eastern  Europe. 
Aid  to  Russia  was  paramount  for  policy  makers  in  Bonn  for  a 
variety  of  reasons,  including  the  desire  to  expedite  the  with- 
drawal of  Soviet  troops  from  eastern  Germany  and  the  wish  to 
enhance  Germany's  security  by  promoting  democracy  and  a 
market  economy  in  Eastern  Europe  and  in  the  Soviet  Union's 
successor  states. 


429 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Because  of  these  vital  concerns,  the  German  government 
emerged  as  an  important  champion  of  aid  to  the  former  Soviet 
bloc.  Chancellor  Kohl  repeatedly  prodded  his  Western  part- 
ners toward  what  he  often  termed  "fair  international 
burden-sharing"  with  regard  to  aid  for  the  emerging  democra- 
cies in  the  former  Soviet  bloc.  The  US$24  billion  aid  package 
of  the  Group  of  Seven  (G-7 — see  Glossary)  for  Russia  in  April 
1992  had  come  about  to  a  large  extent  as  a  result  of  German 
insistence.  In  April  1993,  the  G-7  announced  an  additional  aid 
package  for  Russia  totaling  approximately  US$50  billion.  By 
this  time,  German  aid  to  the  successor  states  of  the  Soviet 
Union  totaled  more  than  DM90  billion  (for  value  of  the  deut- 
sche  mark — see  Glossary).  According  to  Chancellor  Kohl,  this 
amount  represented  more  than  half  of  all  Western  contribu- 
tions since  1989.  German  aid  to  the  Commonwealth  of  Inde- 
pendent States  (CIS — see  Glossary)  included  export  credit 
guarantees  for  long-term  loans;  sustained  support  for  the  with- 
drawal and  reintegration  of  CIS  troops  stationed  in  eastern 
Germany;  financial  help  to  aid  the  CIS  in  its  development  of 
market  institutions  and  infrastructure;  and  more  than  DM100 
million  in  bilateral  and  multilateral  aid  to  improve  safety  stan- 
dards in  Soviet-designed  nuclear  power  plants. 

Part  of  German  aid  to  the  CIS  was  to  provide  for  the  material 
well-being  of  the  estimated  2  million  ethnic  Germans  who  still 
resided  in  former  Soviet  republics.  This  aid  was  designed  to 
offer  incentives  for  ethnic  Germans  to  remain  in  Russia  and  in 
other  CIS  states  rather  than  to  emigrate  to  Germany,  where 
they  had  the  right  to  become  citizens  of  the  Federal  Republic 
and  receive  significant  amounts  of  help  in  becoming  inte- 
grated into  the  homeland  of  their  ancestors  (see  Immigration, 
ch.  3).  The  German  government  has  even  discussed  with  Rus- 
sian representatives  the  possibility  of  restoring  the  "Volga 
Republic"  disbanded  by  Joseph  Stalin  in  1941  as  a  possible  area 
of  settlement  for  ethnic  Germans  in  Russia. 

Elsewhere  in  Eastern  Europe,  the  subject  of  ethnic  German 
minorities  has  played  a  role  in  German  foreign  policy.  By  the 
mid-1990s,  German-Czech  relations,  for  example,  still  had  not 
been  fully  normalized,  to  a  large  extent  because  expellee 
groups  in  the  Federal  Republic  continued  to  lobby  for  restitu- 
tion or  compensation  for  property  owned  by  Germans  in  the 
former  Czechoslovakia  and  confiscated  after  World  War  II.  The 
German-Czech  Friendship  Treaty  was  signed  in  1992,  but  it 


430 


Foreign  Relations 


failed  to  address  the  question  of  compensation  for  Czech  vic- 
tims of  Nazism. 

Foreign  Policy  Formulation 

Institutional  Framework 

Structural  weaknesses  of  the  German  central  government 
were  deliberately  crafted  during  the  years  of  Allied  occupation 
(1945-49)  to  preclude  the  possibility  that  extremists  could 
once  again  return  to  government  (see  Constitutional  Frame- 
work, ch.  7) .  The  chancellor,  the  cabinet,  and  the  legislature  all 
contribute  to  the  policy-making  process.  Moreover,  power  is 
divided  between  the  federal  and  Land  governments.  Foreign 
policy  is  the  prerogative  of  the  federal  government,  but  Lander 
are  permitted  to  conclude  agreements  with  foreign  countries; 
such  agreements  in  turn  are  subject  to  approval  by  the  federal 
government. 

Article  65  of  the  Basic  Law  stipulates  that  the  federal  chan- 
cellor is  responsible  for  general  policy,  and  the  Federal  Chan- 
cellery (the  chancellor's  office)  serves  as  the  center  for  policy 
review  and  coordination.  The  chancellor's  direct  executive  role 
is  limited,  however.  Although  he  or  she  has  wide  powers  to 
name  political  appointees  in  government,  the  chancellor  does 
not  enjoy  complete  freedom  in  making  appointments  to  cabi- 
net posts.  Political  necessity  demands,  for  instance,  the  guaran- 
tee of  a  number  of  cabinet  posts  to  coalition  partners.  In  1995, 
for  example,  important  portfolios,  such  as  economics  and  for- 
eign affairs,  were  controlled  by  the  FDP,  Helmut  Kohl's  junior 
coalition  partner.  The  resulting  diversity  of  views  at  the  highest 
level  of  government  accounts  for  sustained  policy  splits  and  a 
process  in  which  it  is  at  times  difficult  to  resolve  particularly 
contentious  issues. 

The  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  is  the  central  department  for 
planning  and  implementing  foreign  policy.  Like  the  United 
States,  Germany  has  a  corps  of  professional  diplomats.  Those 
wishing  to  join  Germany's  foreign  service  may  file  their  applica- 
tion once  a  year.  Successful  candidates  undergo  a  two-year 
training  program.  About  one-third  of  Germany's  diplomats  are 
lawyers. 

The  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  shares  responsibility  for  for- 
eign economic  policy  with  the  Ministry  for  Economics  and  the 
Ministry  of  Finance;  security  policy  is  coordinated  with  the 
Ministry  of  Defense.  Although  the  executive  branch  generally 


431 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

takes  the  initiative  in  foreign  affairs,  the  Bundestag  (the  lower 
house  of  parliament)  and  the  Bundesrat  (the  upper  house  of 
parliament)  are  involved  in  the  policy-making  process.  These 
bodies  ratify  foreign  treaties  and  approve  most  legislation  and 
budgetary  provisions.  Parliamentary  groups  (Fraktionen;  sing., 
Fraktiori)  in  the  Bundestag  and  various  committees  pertaining 
to  foreign  affairs  provide  organizational  structure  for  the  pol- 
icy-making process. 

Domestic  Influences  on  Foreign  Policy 

Foreign  Policy  Positions  of  the  Political  Parties 

Members  of  Kohl's  CDU  and  its  Bavarian  sister  party,  the 
Christian  Social  Union  (Christlich-Soziale  Union — CSU), 
assert  that  transatlantic  links  should  be  given  priority  over 
more  European-dominated  organizations  such  as  the  CSCE, 
especially  in  the  discussion  of  security  matters.  They  also  stress 
that  assumption  of  responsibility  in  international  affairs  would 
necessarily  demand  a  resolution  of  the  "out-of-areaM  debate, 
that  is,  whether  Germany  would  be  allowed  to  participate 
alongside  Alliance  partners  in  future  military  operations. 

The  CSU  has  distinguished  itself  from  the  CDU  by  pushing  a 
slightly  more  confident  tone  regarding  what  its  members  per- 
ceive as  German  national  interests.  Notable  in  this  regard  were 
CSU  demands  that  Bonn  and  Prague  renegotiate  a  friendship 
treaty  to  give  greater  emphasis  to  property  claims  of  ethnic 
Germans  (living  mostly  in  Bavaria)  who  had  emigrated  or  been 
expelled  from  Czechoslovakia  after  World  War  II.  In  May  1992, 
the  CSU  announced  that  it  would  vote  against  the  German- 
Czechoslovak  friendship  treaty  in  the  Bundesrat. 

Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Genscher's  party,  the  FDP,  is  per- 
haps the  least  nationalistic  and  the  most  multilateral  in  philoso- 
phy of  the  German  political  parties  when  it  comes  to  the 
subject  of  foreign  policy.  Although  FDP  voters,  like  those  of  the 
CDU,  strongly  favor  membership  in  NATO  and  rapid  Euro- 
pean unification,  FDP  supporters  have  stressed  to  a  greater 
extent  than  the  other  parties  the  importance  of  CSCE  institu- 
tions and  policies  aimed  at  arms  control  and  arms  reductions. 
Holding  views  markedly  different  in  this  regard  than  those 
held  by  the  CDU/CSU,  FDP  voters  place  far  less  emphasis  on 
the  participation  of  German  soldiers  in  peacekeeping  and 
peacemaking  missions  under  UN  auspices.

On  foreign  policy  issues,  the  SPD  is  distinct  in  a  number  of 
ways  from  the  ruling  coalition  government  in  Bonn.  Like  the 
FDP,  the  SPD  is  a  strong  supporter  of  the  CSCE  but  favors 
greater  restrictions  on  out-of-area  missions  for  the  Bundeswehr. 
Although  fundamentally  multilateralist  in  sentiment  (the  SPD 
supports  a  United  States  of  Europe  and  more  responsibility  for 
the  UN  in  collective  security),  the  SPD  is  apt  to  express  its 
desire  that  Germany  play  a  singular  and  special  role  in  interna- 
tional relations  because  of  its  recent  troubled  history.  A  survey 
taken  in  the  early  1990s  found  that  35  percent  of  SPD  voters 
preferred  a  neutral  status  for  united  Germany  Of  the  major 
political  parties,  the  SDP  is  the  biggest  supporter  of  neutrality 
and  on  balance  offers  the  lowest  support  for  NATO.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

The  Greens  (Die  Grunen),  a  western  German  environmen- 
talist party,  united  in  1993  with  an  eastern  German  political 
group,  Alliance  90  (Bundnis  90),  to  form  Alliance  90/The 
Greens,  commonly  called  the  Greens.  Surveys  from  the  early 
1990s  found  that  one-third  of  the  traditionally  pacifist  Green 
voters  supported  continued  membership  in  NATO.  Nearly  50 
percent  backed  European  unity.  Although  the  Greens  ada- 
mantly opposed  German  participation  in  Operation  Desert 
Storm,  some  members  have  begun  to  call  for  a  multilateral  mil- 
itary intervention  in  the  Balkan  war.  However,  they  either 
eschew  the  question  of  or  oppose  German  involvement. 

Other  small  parties,  such  as  the  PDS  and  the  right-wing  radi- 
cal Republikaner  (Die  Republikaner — REP),  are  either 
opposed  to  or  reluctant  to  support  German  membership  in 
NATO  and  reject  European  integration  (according  to  the 
Republikaner)  as  subordinating  German  interests  to  a 
pan-European  bureaucratic  architecture.  Neither  the  PDS  nor 
the  Republikaner  played  a  significant  role  in  mainstream 
debate  during  the  first  several  years  following  unification. 

Public  Opinion 

After  unification,  Germany  soon  became  confident  about  its 
greater  responsibility  in  international  relations.  According  to  a 
1991  Rand  Corporation  survey,  62  percent  of  the  population 
said  they  thought  that  Germany  should  pursue  a  more  active 
international  role.  Some  77  percent  voiced  the  opinion  that 
their  country  was  best  suited  to  play  the  leading  foreign  policy 
role  in  Europe.  There  were  even  signs  that  Germans  were  com- 
ing to  terms  with  the  idea  of  international  military  interven- 
tion. In  1992  about  53  percent  of  Germans  (compared  with  43 
percent  the  previous  year)  said  they  believed  that  the  use  of 
military  force  is  justified  when  principles  of  international  law 
and  human  rights  are  violated. 

The  reluctance  of  Germans  to  think  in  terms  of  their  coun- 
try's involvement  in  multilateral  military  actions  remained 
high,  however.  Although  53  percent  supported  participation  of 
the  Bundeswehr  in  peacekeeping  operations  after  unification, 
barely  33  percent  favored  German  military  involvement  in 
NATO  operations  outside  of  German  territory.  Only  20  per- 
cent were  sympathetic  to  the  idea  of  German  forces  participat- 
ing in  collective  security  actions  such  as  Operation  Desert 
Storm.  A  1994  follow-up  study  by  the  Rand  Corporation  found 
increasing  support  in  German  public  opinion  for  a  German 


434 


Foreign  Relations 


defense  role  beyond  the  country's  borders.  But  data  also 
reflected  uncertainty  about  what  that  role  should  entail. 

In  the  aftermath  of  communism's  demise,  Germans,  espe- 
cially Germans  living  in  the  old  Lander,  continued  to  believe 
that  NATO  was  essential  to  their  security.  They  did  so  even 
though  the  contours  of  a  distinct  threat  had  not  emerged  and 
even  though  Germany's  new  international  role  remained  very 
much  in  question.  A  1990-91  study  by  the  Rand  Corporation 
commissioned  by  the  United  States  Air  Force  discovered  that 
85  percent  of  the  German  populace  supported  membership  in 
international  alliances  in  general,  with  two  out  of  three  western 
Germans  considering  NATO  essential  for  their  security.  (A 
West  German  Emnid  poll  in  the  autumn  of  1988  had  shown  86 
percent  favoring  NATO  membership.)  By  contrast,  only  35  per- 
cent of  eastern  Germans  considered  NATO  indispensable.  The 
fact  that  western  Germans  made  up  roughly  four-fifths  of 
united  Germany's  population  and  that  western  Germans  domi- 
nated the  united  country's  policy  establishment  led  most  ana- 
lysts to  conclude  that  the  addition  of  eastern  Germany  would 
have  a  minimal  impact  on  the  Federal  Republic's  foreign  pol- 
icy. 

The  German  position  on  the  presence  of  United  States 
troops  remains  one  of  ambivalence.  According  to  the  Rand 
study,  57  percent  supported  a  complete  withdrawal  of  United 
States  troops  from  the  territory  of  the  Federal  Republic.  West- 
ern Germans  were  divided  in  their  view — 43  percent  favoring 
and  49  percent  rejecting  the  sustained  presence  of  these 
troops.  Eastern  Germans  demonstrated  greater  consensus  on 
the  issue  of  United  States  troops,  with  84  percent  opposing  a 
future  United  States  military  presence. 

When  asked  why  one  should  support  NATO  in  the  post-Cold 
War  era,  western  Germans  gave  as  the  primary  reason  the  fact 
that  the  defense  organization  had  become  a  fixture  on  the 
political  landscape  over  the  course  of  previous  decades  and 
had  done  a  good  job  in  maintaining  peace  on  the  continent. 
Few  respondents  felt  that  NATO  should  have  more  military 
responsibilities,  however.  In  fact,  42  percent  voiced  apprehen- 
sion that  NATO  could  be  used  in  the  future  to  draw  Germany 
into  conflicts  where  its  interests  were  not  represented.  The 
impressions  from  these  results  were  roughly  aligned  with  the 
findings  from  polls  conducted  by  German  institutes  during  the 
same  time  frame.  In  1991  a  majority  of  Germans  regarded  Swit- 
zerland— a  neutral  although  not  demilitarized  state — as  an 


435

appropriate  model  for  the  new  Germany's  role  in  international 
affairs. 

The  Out-of-Area  Debate 

Immediately  after  unification,  the  prevailing  interpretation 
of  the  Basic  Law  allowed  for  the  Federal  Republic's  participa- 
tion in  systems  of  collective  security  but  precluded  its  armed 
forces  from  any  activity  not  specifically  attributable  to  the  coun- 
try's defense,  unless  explicitly  authorized  elsewhere  in  the  con- 
stitution. Article  26  of  the  Basic  Law  forbids  any  act  of  war  or 
aggression,  and  Article  87  stipulates  that  German  military 
forces  are  permitted  to  become  involved  only  in  defense 
actions.  The  question  of  German  participation  in  out-of-area 
operations  played  an  important  role  in  German  foreign  policy 
debates  of  the  early  1990s. 

The  interpretation  that  combat  missions  outside  the  tradi- 
tional area  covered  by  NATO  are  not  permitted  under  the  con- 
stitution had  been  ratified  by  a  decision  by  the  SPD-led 
government  of  Chancellor  Helmut  Schmidt  (1974-82)  in  April 
1981.  This  view  was  reconfirmed  in  1983  by  the  new  Kohl  gov- 
ernment soon  after  it  took  power. 

The  debate  on  out-of-area  operations  during  the  Persian 
Gulf  War  led  to  a  consensus  by  the  major  political  parties — 
although  for  varying  reasons — that  rather  than  reinterpreta- 
tion,  the  constitution  was  in  need  of  amendment  to  allow  Ger- 
man forces  to  assume  a  new  role  in  collective  security. 
Amending  the  constitution  requires  a  two-thirds  majority  in 
both  the  Bundestag  and  the  Bundesrat.  Conflict  arose,  first 
because  the  opposition  SPD  rejected  the  idea  of  an  amend- 
ment, then  later  because  neither  the  SPD  nor  the  other  parties 
could  agree  on  the  precise  provisions  of  such  an  amendment. 

The  SPD  insisted  that  an  amendment  to  the  constitution 
allow  for  German  participation  in  UN  peacekeeping  opera- 
tions only.  This  position  was  reached  after  heated  debate  at  the 
party's  convention  in  May  1991,  and  even  then,  only  with  the 
strong  push  of  SPD  leader  Bjorn  Engholm  and  the  party's  mod- 
erate faction.  The  measure  passed  by  the  relatively  small  mar- 
gin of  230  to  179.  The  SPD  stopped  short  of  supporting 
German  participation  in  combat  missions  sanctioned  under 
Chapter  VII  of  the  UN  Charter,  which  means  that  in  the  future, 
operations  such  as  Desert  Storm  would  not  mandate  German 
involvement. 


436 


Foreign  Relations 


Citing  special  constraints  stemming  from  German  history 
and  fears  that  Germany,  against  its  own  interests,  would  be 
drawn  into  conflicts  by  other  powers  (notably  the  United 
States),  the  SPD  envisioned  a  narrow  set  of  circumstances  for 
the  deployment  of  German  forces.  These  included  a  mandate 
by  the  UN  Security  Council;  a  cease-fire;  consent  of  the  warring 
parties;  operational  control  by  the  UN;  and  the  participation  of 
other  European  countries.  The  SPD's  position  also  reflected 
the  party's  devotion  to  the  idea  that  diplomatic  and  economic 
means,  and  only  rarely,  if  ever,  the  military,  could  provide  for 
Germany's  defense  and  security. 

The  FDP  followed  the  lead  outlined  by  Genscher,  its  dovish 
foreign  minister,  and,  like  the  SPD,  agreed  on  restricting  the 
Bundeswehr's  activities  to  blue-helmet  peacekeeping  missions. 
An  amendment  to  the  constitution  would  explicitly  require  UN 
authorization  for  out-of-area  deployments,  even  when  Ger- 
mans were  participating  within  NATO  and  WEU  units.  In  an 
attempt  to  further  limit  the  opportunity  for  actual  combat 
involvement  and  to  stress  the  European  character  of  the  new 
German  state,  the  FDP  also  stipulated  that  fighting  missions  be 
permitted  only  when  other  EC  members  were  present. 

The  CDU  was  predictably  not  satisfied  with  restrictions  that 
provided  exclusively  for  blue-helmet  missions.  Members  of  the 
CDU  and  the  CSU  had  initially  argued  that  an  amendment  to 
the  constitution  was  not  necessary  in  order  for  German  troops 
to  cooperate  in  multilateral  military  operations  abroad.  They 
pointed  to  Article  24(2),  of  the  Basic  Law,  which  empowers  the 
Federal  Republic  to  participate  in  systems  of  collective  security 
such  as  the  UN.  Proponents  of  this  argument  rejected  the  idea 
that  the  term  "defense,"  as  applied  in  Article  87a(2)  of  the 
Basic  Law,  should  be  interpreted  narrowly  and  tied  exclusively 
to  the  defense  of  Germany  or  of  an  alliance  partner. 

Nevertheless,  Kohl's  party  had  agreed  that  the  constitution 
must  be  amended  in  order  to  permit  German  troops  a  role  in 
peacekeeping  and  peacemaking  missions  abroad.  Kohl's  party 
wanted  not  only  UN  missions  mandated  by  the  constitution  but 
also  NATO  and  WEU  out-of-area  missions.  In  the  view  of  lead- 
ing defense  experts  in  the  CDU,  these  were  the  only  organiza- 
tions capable  of  providing  defense.  Neither  the  UN  nor  the 
CSCE,  favorites  of  the  FDP  and  the  SPD,  were  considered  via- 
ble instruments  of  military  action.  Some  more  outspoken 
members  of  the  CDU  and  CSU  favored  a  reduction  of  all  con- 
straints on  the  exercise  of  German  power  in  an  attempt  to 


437 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

equalize  the  Federal  Republic's  room  for  maneuvering  with 
Britain  and  France. 

Minister  of  Defense  Volker  Ruhe  strongly  argued  in  favor  of 
Germany's  assuming  full  and  normal  responsibilities  in  peace- 
keeping and  peacemaking  operations  within  the  Alliance.  But 
he  also  frequently  stressed  that  German  public  opinion  would 
only  gradually  adapt  to  its  new  international  circumstance. 

In  an  attempt  to  sensitize  the  German  public  to  changes  in 
the  international  climate  and  the  united  country's  emerging 
responsibilities,  the  Kohl  government  had  been  incrementally 
enlarging  German  military  participation  in  operations  abroad, 
arguably  within  the  confines  of  the  constitution.  Bonn  allowed 
German  minesweepers  and  their  crews  to  operate  in  the  Per- 
sian Gulf  from  April  through  July  1991  after  the  war  had 
ended,  justifying  the  mission  on  humanitarian  grounds.  The 
German  government  used  Bundeswehr  personnel  to  supply 
transportation  and  to  assist  in  the  establishment  of  refugee 
camps  in  Iran  and  Iraq  for  Kurds,  who  had  been  persecuted  by 
Iraqi  forces.  German  military  medical  personnel  were  assigned 
in  May  1992  to  participate  in  the  UN  mission  in  Cambodia. 
German  military  units  joined  in  the  UN's  humanitarian  effort 
in  Somalia  in  1992-93,  but  only  after  arduous  parliamentary 
debate.  German  forces  also  were  involved  in  the  Adriatic  when 
UN  forces  monitored  compliance  with  the  internationally 
imposed  arms  embargo  by  parties  in  the  Yugoslav  conflict.  In 
an  important  decision  of  July  12,  1994,  Germany's  highest 
court,  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court,  ruled  that  German 
troops  can  take  part  in  both  UN  peacekeeping  and  peacemak- 
ing missions,  as  long  as  the  Bundestag  approves  each  operation 
by  a  simple  majority.  The  court  also  stated  that  Germany  can 
assign  forces  to  NATO  and  WEU  operations  directed  at  imple- 
menting resolutions  of  the  UN  Security  Council.  Thus,  the 
decision  cleared  the  way  for  a  German  military  role  beyond  the 
country's  and  NATO's  current  borders,  and  German  fliers  sub- 
sequently participated  in  NATO  missions  over  Bosnia. 

The  conduct  of  foreign  policy  continues  to  belong  to  the 
domain  of  the  executive  branch  of  government  in  Germany. 
But  the  highly  controversial  and  emotional  debate  concerning 
German  participation  in  peacekeeping  and  peacemaking  mis- 
sions abroad  has  meant  that  the  Bundestag  will  continue  to  be 
directly  involved  in  the  actual  decision-making  process.

International  Cooperation 

North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization 

During  the  Cold  War  era,  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organi- 
zation (NATO)  was  central  to  the  formulation  and  implemen- 
tation of  West  Germany's  foreign  and  defense  policies.  In  1954 
and  1955  (the  year  the  Warsaw  Pact  was  established),  agree- 
ments were  reached  by  the  Allied  powers  to  end  the  occupa- 
tion of  the  Federal  Republic  and  grant  West  Germany 
sovereignty.  It  was  in  conjunction  with  these  decisions  that  West 
Germany  had  been  permitted  to  rearm  and  to  obtain  member- 
ship in  the  Western  European  Union  (WEU)  and  NATO.  Nev- 
ertheless, under  the  Western  European  Union  Treaty  of  May 
1955,  the  Federal  Republic  was  prohibited  from  possessing 
weapons  of  mass  destruction.  Moreover,  all  West  German 
armed  forces  were  assigned  to  NATO  and  could  not  operate 
out  of  area. 

During  the  Cold  War,  the  underlying  tone  of  NATO's  strat- 
egy shifted  at  times  to  accommodate  the  changing  security 
environment  in  the  United  States  and  in  Europe.  For  example, 
in  1967  the  Harmel  Report,  developed  during  the  advent  of 
Willy  Brandt's  Ostpolitik  in  Germany,  helped  initiate  the  West's 
dual  strategy  of  defense  and  detente  with  the  Soviet  bloc.  The 
Harmel  Report's  aversion  to  confrontation  was  further  ampli- 
fied by  the  1975  Helsinki  Accords,  or  the  Final  Act  of  the  Con- 
ference on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe  (CSCE).  The 
CSCE  was  to  provide  a  framework  for  cooperation  between 
NATO  and  Warsaw  Pact  members  by  intensifying  contacts  and 
respecting  the  inviolability  of  Eastern  Europe's  postwar  bor- 
ders. 

Despite  the  prevailing  climate  of  detente  in  the  1970s, 
NATO  remained  for  the  United  States  and  its  allies  the  princi- 
pal instrument  with  which  to  deter  Soviet  aggression  on  the 
continent  and  if  necessary  to  defend  the  West  European 
democracies  from  attack  by  the  Warsaw  Pact.  To  this  end,  the 
role  of  the  Federal  Republic  was  indispensable.  West  Germany 
was  the  frontline  state  and  home  to  the  largest  concentration 
of  United  States  troops  and  NATO-controlled  nuclear  weapons 
in  the  European  theater.  Across  the  border  in  the  GDR,  the 
Soviet  Union  had  amassed  its  greatest  number  of  troops  out- 
side its  own  territory. 

Since  its  founding,  NATO  had  served  other  functions  as 
well.  After  World  War  II,  policy  makers  in  Washington  and  in 


439 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

major  European  capitals  had  sought  to  curb  and  control  Ger- 
man power  by  wedding  the  West  German  state  to  multilateral 
institutions.  Hence,  NATO  (and  to  some  extent  the  EC)  was 
designed  not  only  as  an  instrument  with  which  to  keep  the 
Soviet  Union  out  of  Western  Europe  but  also  as  a  means  to  con- 
strain Germany  from  returning  to  the  expansionist  behavior 
that  had  characterized  its  foreign  policy  in  the  first  half  of  the 
century.  Thus,  NATO's  purpose  was  often  said  to  reflect  a  strat- 
egy of  double  containment:  to  contain  the  Soviet  Union  as  well 
as  Germany.  In  addition,  NATO  was  also  to  perform  the 
broader  function  of  muting  the  traditional  regional  rivalries 
that  had  previously  undermined  Europe's  peace  and  stability. 

As  far  as  West  Germany  was  concerned,  it  practiced  what  was 
often  referred  to  as  a  policy  of  self-containment.  West  Ger- 
many's postwar  leaders  deliberately  subjugated  national  inter- 
ests to  the  stated  objectives  of  the  EC  and  NATO.  Embracing 
federalism  and  the  inculcation  of  democratic  values,  the  West 
German  public  and  political  elites  also  accepted  Germany's 
adjustment  to  the  role  of  civilian  power  and  junior  partner  in 
the  Alliance.  Once  the  economic  miracle  had  taken  place  and 
the  reconstruction  of  Germany  had  given  way  to  prosperity, 
this  development  in  the  German  posture  was  reflected  in  the 
adage  that  the  West  German  democracy  was  "an  economic 
giant  but  a  political  dwarf." 

Although  NATO's  primary  raison  d'etre  collapsed  with  the 
disintegration  of  the  Soviet  empire  (in  Germany  the  GDR's 
armed  forces  were  absorbed  by  the  Bundeswehr),  new  uncer- 
tainties and  instabilities  in  the  international  climate  after  1989 
led  many  observers  to  conclude  that  the  Atlantic  Alliance, 
which  came  into  force  in  April  1949,  ought  to  remain  intact. 
Many  viewed  NATO's  expansion  to  the  east  as  a  necessary 
means  to  ensure  the  security  of  the  emerging  democracies  of 
Central  and  Eastern  Europe.  Others  continued  to  view  NATO 
as  a  means  to  prevent  the  renationalization  of  German  security 
policy.  Questions  about  united  Germany's  role  in  international 
affairs  in  general,  and  in  a  revamped  NATO  in  particular, 
became  paramount  to  policy  makers  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlan- 
tic. 

In  the  early  summer  of  1992,  NATO  officials  announced  that 
the  Alliance  was  prepared  to  assume  a  peacekeeping  role  in 
Europe  beyond  the  border  of  its  sixteen  member  states. 
According  to  a  plan  approved  at  the  June  1992  meeting  of 
NATO  foreign  ministers  in  Oslo,  NATO  would  henceforth  con- 


440 


Foreign  Relations 


sider  contributing  troops,  supplies,  and  logistical  support  to 
CSCE  peacekeeping  missions.  Clearer  details  regarding 
NATO's  new  military  mission,  however,  remained  in  doubt  in 
the  mid-1990s. 

NATO  had  already  begun  to  grapple  with  questions  about  its 
future  during  the  Two-Plus-Four  Talks.  The  London  Declara- 
tion on  NATO  of  July  6,  1990,  articulated  a  vision  that  kept  the 
NATO  treaty  in  force  as  a  factor  of  stability  across  Europe. 
Reflecting  a  fundamental  change  of  atmosphere  precipitated 
by  communism's  collapse,  NATO  members  committed  them- 
selves to  transforming  the  Western  Alliance  from  adversary  to 
friend  for  the  members  of  the  former  Soviet  bloc.  Illustrating 
this  transformation  were  the  visits  of  Czechoslovak  president 
Vaclav  Havel  and  Polish  president  Lech  Walesa  to  NATO  Head- 
quarters in  Brussels  in  early  1991.  In  fact,  by  the  end  of  that 
same  year  Russian  president  Boris  Yeltsin  suggested  that  his 
own  country  might  apply  for  NATO  membership. 

Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Genscher  was  a  staunch  propo- 
nent of  institutionalizing  cooperative  links  between  East  and 
West.  In  the  Declaration  on  Peace  and  Cooperation  adopted 
on  November  8,  1991,  leaders  of  the  sixteen  NATO  nations 
meeting  in  Rome  submitted  to  eight  Central  and  East  Euro- 
pean countries  (Bulgaria,  Czechoslovakia,  Estonia,  Hungary, 
Latvia,  Lithuania,  Poland,  and  Romania)  and  the  Soviet  Union 
proposals  to  institutionalize  consultations  among  former  adver- 
saries on  a  broad  range  of  security  concerns. 

Because  many  Central  and  East  European  countries  were 
beset  with  ethnic  tensions  in  the  early  1990s  and  still  had  unre- 
solved border  disputes  with  neighbors,  NATO  officials  felt  it 
unreasonable  to  anticipate  early  NATO  membership.  Short  of 
full  membership,  however,  former  members  of  the  Warsaw  Pact 
were  invited  to  join  Western  states  to  form  the  North  Atlantic 
Cooperation  Council  (NACC).  The  NACC  had  been  proposed 
at  the  initiative  of  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Genscher  and 
Secretary  of  State  Baker  at  the  end  of  1991. 

The  NACC  began  by  mid-1992  to  hold  regular  meetings  at 
the  ministerial  or  ambassadorial  level  with  various  NATO  com- 
mittees and  authorities  tasked  with  the  oversight  of  military, 
political,  and  economic  issues  of  concern  to  member  states.  In 
April  1993,  German  Minister  of  Defense  Ruhe  traveled  to  Mos- 
cow to  sign  the  first  extensive  agreement  between  Russian  and 
German  armed  forces.  Under  the  ten-year  agreement,  a  wide 


441 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

range  of  contacts  between  Russian  and  German  officers  would 
take  place. 

In  the  context  of  this  new  collaborative  posture  between 
West  and  East,  NATO  members  had  already  pledged  them- 
selves to  a  smaller,  restructured  field  of  active  forces,  reduced 
training  and  exercises,  and  enhanced  flexibility  and  coopera- 
tive dialogue  in  deciding  how  to  respond  to  future  interna- 
tional crises.  Also  as  a  result  of  the  London  Declaration,  which 
declared  NATO's  forward  posture  in  Europe  no  longer  neces- 
sary, NATO  countries  had  begun  to  reduce  or  withdraw  their 
forces  from  the  Central  European  theater,  and  from  Germany 
in  particular. 

NATO's  Partnership  for  Peace  (PfP),  launched  in  January 
1994,  sought  even  stronger  links  between  democratic  countries 
of  the  former  Soviet  bloc  and  the  Alliance.  Membership  in  the 
PfP  enabled  these  countries  to  consult  with  NATO  and  cooper- 
ate in  joint  multilateral  crisis  activities. 

In  the  1990s,  the  predominant  view  held  by  the  mainstream 
of  Germany's  defense  establishment  is  that  NATO  remains 
essential  for  German  security  for  three  primary  reasons:  the 
Alliance  is  a  crucial  source  of  stability  for  a  continent  in  the 
throes  of  profound  transformations;  NATO  serves  as  an  indis- 
pensable bridge  to  the  United  States  and  functionally  helps  to 
counter  that  country's  neo-isolationism  by  maintaining  a  visible 
United  States  presence  in  Europe;  and  NATO  remains  the  only 
viable  instrument  for  German  and  European  defense,  given 
that  the  EU,  WEU,  and  OSCE  are  all  still  untested  in  the  coor- 
dination and  implementation  of  defense  policies. 

Western  European  Union 

The  EC  had  also  taken  steps  during  the  first  post-Cold  War 
years  to  enhance  its  competence  in  foreign  affairs.  In  the 
Treaty  on  European  Union,  signed  on  February  7,  1992,  in 
Maastricht,  representatives  of  the  EC's  twelve  members  agreed 
to  take  steps  toward  developing  a  common  European  foreign 
and  defense  policy.  The  treaty  (commonly  referred  to  as  the 
Maastricht  Treaty)  stipulated  that  the  European  Council,  com- 
posed of  the  heads  of  state  and  government  in  the  member 
states,  would  decide  together  on  guidelines  that  would  frame  a 
common  foreign  and  security  policy.  The  council  would  also 
monitor  the  implementation  of  policies  agreed  upon.  In  con- 
junction with  this  diplomatic  consensus,  it  was  agreed  that  the 
Western  European  Union  (WEU),  after  decades  of  relative  dor- 


442 


Foreign  Relations 


mancy,  would  become  the  primary  instrument  with  which  the 
continent  would  enhance  its  own  defense  capability. 

Some  European  proponents  suggested  that  the  WEU  could 
act  as  a  complement  to  NATO  by  serving  in  capacities  in  which 
NATO  would  not.  The  WEU,  for  example,  recognized  no  for- 
mal geographic  limits  to  its  potential  operations.  Those  in  the 
United  States  critical  of  moves  to  revive  the  WEU,  however,  sug- 
gested that  a  European  defense  structure  was  redundant  and 
could  evolve  as  a  competitor  for  NATO  resources  and  person- 
nel. Italy  and  Britain  proposed  that  the  WEU  become  an  arm 
of  NATO,  rather  than  an  independent  European  security  struc- 
ture. NATO  formally  supported  the  process  toward  a  European 
defense  identity  but  emphasized  that  the  Atlantic  Alliance 
should  remain  the  primary  forum  for  the  discussion  of  Euro- 
pean security  issues. 

In  Germany's  view,  the  WEU,  as  the  defense  arm  of  the  EU, 
would  complement  NATO.  The  December  1991  EC  summit  in 
Maastricht  declared  that  the  WEU  would  serve  as  an  instru- 
ment of  European  defense  and  as  such  would  have  the  effect  of 
strengthening  the  European  pillar  of  NATO. 

Members  of  the  WEU,  meeting  in  Bonn  on  November  18, 
1991,  had  issued  a  communique  expressing  a  desire  for 
enhanced  dialogue  with  the  emerging  democracies  of  Central 
and  Eastern  Europe,  the  Baltic  states,  and  the  Soviet  Union. 
This  represented  a  parallel  step  to  that  which  NATO  had 
already  taken  through  creation  of  the  NACC.  The  Bonn  com- 
munique announced  that  foreign  and  defense  ministers  from 
Bulgaria,  Czechoslovakia,  Hungary,  Poland,  and  Romania 
would  be  invited  to  take  part  in  special  meetings  with  members 
of  the  WEU  Council  and  would  be  invited  to  participate  in 
WEU-organized  seminars  in  various  European  countries.  The 
WEU  also  committed  itself  to  creating  a  fact-finding  mission  to 
the  former  Soviet  republics  to  further  investigate  meaningful 
ways  in  which  security  dialogue  could  be  fostered. 

The  Petersberg  Declaration  of  June  1992  empowered  the 
WEU  member  states  with  significant  room  for  maneuver.  Ger- 
many's new  minister  of  foreign  affairs,  Klaus  Kinkel,  and  Minis- 
ter of  Defense  Ruhe  endorsed  the  WEU's  intention  not  only  to 
maintain  peace  but  also  to  enforce  it  if  necessary,  even  in  areas 
outside  the  Alliance. 

Europe's  development  of  a  common  foreign  and  defense 
policy  and  its  establishment  of  a  mature  wing  of  the  Western 
Alliance  that  would  act  as  a  complement  to  NATO  underscored 


443 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  development  of  Europe  as  a  new  world  power  center.  Some 
suggested  that  united  Europe  should  receive  a  permanent  seat 
on  the  UN  Security  Council.  They  noted  that  a  united  Europe 
would  have  more  inhabitants  than  the  United  States  and  Japan 
combined  and  its  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary) 
would  be  larger  than  that  of  the  United  States. 

Eurocorps 

Germany  remained  determined  to  pursue  a  multitracked 
approach  in  the  development  of  its  foreign  and  defense  poli- 
cies. The  Germans  firmly  rejected  subordination  of  European 
integration  to  other  priorities  that  would,  among  other  things 
in  the  German  view,  endanger  the  mutually  important  relation- 
ship that  Bonn  and  Paris  had  carefully  cultivated  since  the  end 
of  World  War  II. 

West  Germany's  first  chancellor,  Konrad  Adenauer  (1949- 
63),  together  with  French  president  Charles  de  Gaulle,  had 
worked  assiduously  to  dismantle  the  historical  enmity  between 
their  two  countries  and  to  lay  the  foundation  for  German- 
French  reconciliation  after  World  War  II  (see  Rearmament  and 
the  European  Defense  Community,  ch.  2).  West  Germany  had 
become  France's  most  important  trading  partner  by  the  1980s 
(accounting  for  40  percent  of  French  trade),  and  the  1983 
revival  of  the  defense  clauses  in  the  German-French  Friendship 
Treaty  (Elysee  Treaty)  of  1963  had  allowed  a  deepening  of  the 
two  countries'  military  ties.  Thus  on  October  16,  1991,  Chan- 
cellor Kohl  and  President  Mitterrand  first  announced  a  plan 
proposing  that  the  WEU  become  the  EC's  defense  arm  and 
that  a  Franco-German  Eurocorps  (based  on  an  already  existing 
brigade)  serve  as  the  core  of  a  new  European  army. 

The  decision  by  Kohl's  government  to  develop  a 
Franco-German  Eurocorps  was  to  be  seen  in  this  context  (Ger- 
many and  France  had  also  been  frustrated  by  the  British  domi- 
nation of  NATO's  rapid  reaction  force  established  in  1991). 
The  Eurocorps  not  only  would  provide  the  basis  for  a  Euro- 
pean force  but  also,  on  a  political  level,  would  assuage  French 
(and  broader  European)  concerns  about  a  return  to  German 
unilateralism  in  foreign  and  defense  policy.  It  had  been  French 
policy  since  the  end  of  World  War  II  to  oppose  any  move  by  the 
Federal  Republic  perceived  as  leading  to  the  establishment  of  a 
German  national  foreign  and  defense  policy. 

In  the  face  of  criticism  from  the  NATO  establishment,  the 
Germans  argued  that  the  Eurocorps  would  have  the  positive

effect  of  drawing  the  French  closer  to  the  Atlantic  Alliance. 
French  troops  belonging  to  the  joint  military  corps  could  be 
made  available  to  NATO,  either  as  rapid  deployment  forces  or 
as  main  defense  forces,  the  Germans  argued.  Skeptics — the 
Dutch,  for  instance — contended,  on  the  contrary,  that  the 
Eurocorps  would  actually  decrease  the  number  of  French  and 
German  troops  available  to  NATO.  Although  Germans  claimed 
that  the  joint  military  corps  would  intensify  French  links  to 
NATO,  it  was  also  undoubtedly  true  that  the  collaborative  step 
was  viewed  as  an  altogether  different  opportunity  by  the 
French  defense  establishment,  long  dominated  by  elements 
favoring  an  independent  European  security  identity. 

It  was  not  exclusively  in  France,  although  perhaps  most 
prominently,  that  some  strategic  thinkers  sought  to  "European- 
ize"  the  continent's  defense  by  seeing  to  it  that  certain  NATO 
functions  were  delegated  to  the  EC  or  the  WEU.  Not  surpris- 
ingly, Bonn's  moves  to  help  develop  the  Eurocorps  provoked 
concern  and  in  some  circles  irritation  among  NATO  advocates 
both  in  the  United  States  and  in  Europe.  The  Netherlands, 
Britain,  and  Denmark  all  expressed  various  degrees  of  reserva- 
tion or  opposition  to  the  corps.  Britain  and  the  Netherlands  in 
particular  were  reluctant  to  accept  the  premise  that  a  Euro- 
pean defense  could  be  dominated  by  the  French  and  the  Ger- 


445

mans.  Spain,  Belgium,  and  Luxembourg,  however,  welcomed 
the  German-French  initiative  to  form  a  joint  military  corps, 
and  eventually  all  these  countries  pledged  troops  to  it. 

The  Eurocorps  was  formally  proposed  by  Chancellor  Kohl 
and  President  Mitterrand  in  May  1992.  Both  leaders  invited  all 
members  of  the  WEU  to  participate.  The  headquarters  for  the 
corps  was  established  in  Strasbourg  in  July  1992,  and  the  corps 
was  scheduled  to  become  operational  by  late  1995.  At  the  time 
of  its  inception,  the  corps  was  to  have  three  military  functions: 
to  join  and  assist  NATO  missions;  to  fulfill  missions  under  WEU 
command  outside  traditional  NATO  territory;  and  to  provide 
international  humanitarian  assistance. 

Germans  balanced  their  push  for  European  security  struc- 
tures in  the  early  1990s  by  repeatedly  stressing  their  commit- 
ment to  NATO.  NATO  remained  central  to  German  foreign 
and  defense  policies  because  of  the  organization's  institutional 
ties  to  the  United  States,  a  fact  that  caused  unrest  in  the  French 
foreign  policy  establishment  and  among  like-minded  thinkers 
in  Germany,  who  sought  evolution  away  from  an  alliance  domi- 
nated by  the  United  States.  A  middle  ground  was  sought  by 
some  defense  experts  who,  like  Bundeswehr  General  Inspekteur 
Klaus  Naumann,  contended  that  a  "more  European  NATO" 
would  appropriately  bring  balance  to  the  previously  United 
States-dominated  defense  organization. 

European  Union 

Since  its  creation  in  1957,  the  central  objective  of  the  Euro- 
pean Community  (EC — see  Glossary)  has  been  to  advance  the 
economic  integration  of  Western  Europe,  primarily  through 
the  reduction  or  elimination  of  barriers  to  free  trade  and 
investment.  The  EC  has  long  enjoyed  a  high  level  of  sustained 
popularity  in  West  Germany.  Building  on  this  foundation  of 
support,  West  German  leaders  in  the  late  1980s  set  out  to  pur- 
sue, in  concert  with  other  West  European  states  (Britain  and 
some  of  the  smaller  countries  in  northern  Europe  did  not  par- 
ticipate), the  objective  of  a  more  complete  political  and  eco- 
nomic union  (see  Germany  in  the  European  Economy,  ch.  6). 

The  Single  European  Act  of  1986-87,  designed  to  create  a 
single  common  market  without  internal  frontiers,  was  imple- 
mented in  principle  on  January  1,  1993.  In  December  1991,  EC 
leaders  met  in  Maastricht  to  reach  agreement  on  the  Draft 
Treaty  on  Political  Union.  As  a  consequence  of  the  treaty, 
Europe  was  committed  to  the  creation  of  a  common  currency, 


446 


Foreign  Relations 


set  to  begin  in  1999  at  the  latest.  At  Maastricht,  EC  heads  of 
state,  in  addition  to  agreeing  on  a  path  to  political  union,  also 
agreed  to  the  goal  of  establishing  a  common  foreign  and 
defense  policy.  The  Maastricht  Treaty  provided  the  foundation 
for  a  federalized  United  States  of  Europe  by  creating  the  Euro- 
pean Union  (EU — see  Glossary),  of  which  the  EC  is  a  part. 

In  part  as  a  consequence  of  the  momentous  changes  in  Cen- 
tral and  Eastern  Europe  and  the  Soviet  Union,  steps  toward 
European  unity  suffered  setbacks  in  the  early  1990s.  War  in 
Yugoslavia  and  the  inability  of  the  EC  to  fashion  a  cogent  and 
effective  response  decimated  the  infant  concept  of  a  common 
defense  policy.  Meanwhile,  mired  in  the  uncertainties  about 
Maastricht's  chances  for  ratification  during  the  autumn  of 
1991,  Europe's  financial  markets  were  driven  into  a  brief  con- 
vulsive episode  in  September,  with  the  result  that  EC  efforts  to 
impose  a  common  financial  discipline  were  effectively  under- 
mined. 

At  the  same  time,  popular  opinion  in  EC  countries  signaled 
that  their  own  elected  leaders  and  EC  bureaucrats  had  lost 
touch  with  their  respective  electorates'  concerns.  Paramount 
were  popular  fears  in  Europe  about  a  loss  of  sovereignty  and 
national  identity  and  the  uncontrollable  expansion  of  the  EC's 
bureaucracy.  Although  political  elites  in  Germany  remained 
firmly  committed  to  Maastricht,  the  German  public  was  espe- 
cially restive  about  the  potential  loss  of  the  deutsche  mark — the 
country's  symbol  of  postwar  economic  success  and  in  some 
respects  its  postnational  identity.  Roughly  70  percent  of  Ger- 
mans rejected  the  notion  that  they  should  trade  their  vaunted 
currency  for  an  untested  European  currency,  the  European 
currency  unit  (ECU — see  Glossary). 

In  the  wake  of  votes  in  Denmark  and  in  France  against  ratifi- 
cation of  the  Maastricht  Treaty,  Chancellor  Kohl  showed  no 
loss  of  overall  optimism.  Continuation  of  the  process  of  Euro- 
pean integration  had  been  a  central  foreign  policy  objective  of 
the  Federal  Republic.  Following  a  special  one-day  EC  summit 
in  Birmingham,  England,  on  October  16,  1992,  Kohl  pro- 
claimed that  the  "European  locomotive  [would]  continue," 
because  all  EC  members  still  voiced  a  desire  to  ratify  the  Maas- 
tricht Treaty.  In  a  speech  before  the  Bundestag  delivered  three 
weeks  earlier,  Kohl  had  restated  his  support  for  what  he  inter- 
preted as  the  treaty's  five  main  objectives:  common  foreign  and 
security  policies;  development  of  an  economic  and  monetary 
union;  development  of  common  policy  on  domestic  security

matters;  intensified  cooperation  in  environmental  protection; 
and  enhancement  of  the  role  of  the  European  Parliament. 

In  political  terms,  German  officials  viewed  the  Maastricht 
Treaty  as  a  way  to  reassure  European  neighbors  of  Germany's 
trustworthiness  as  an  international  partner.  To  this  end,  in  fact, 
Germany  had  actually  sought  a  special  leadership  role  of  sorts. 
In  October  1992,  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Kinkel  stressed  his 
country's  unique  responsibility,  as  the  most  populated  and  eco- 
nomically strongest  country  in  Europe,  "to  send  a  signal  of  con- 
fidence in  a  common  future  to  our  still-hesitant  partners." 
Germany  (where  only  parliamentary  approval  was  required) 
approved  the  treaty  in  December  of  the  same  year. 

Indeed,  many  Europeans,  the  French  perhaps  in  particular, 
interpreted  the  Maastricht  Treaty  as  a  German  containment 
policy.  EC  president  Jacques  Delors  had  already  sought  to  place 
German  unification  within  the  EC  framework.  Rather  bluntly, 
during  the  weeks  prior  to  the  country's  referendum,  a  number 
of  Maastricht's  supporters  in  France  had  argued  that  European 
unity  would  serve  as  an  instrument  with  which  to  bind  and 
tame  the  newly  united  Germans.  French  opponents  of  the 
treaty,  conversely  (and  ironically),  contended  that  European 
union  would  inevitably  be  controlled  by  an  overwhelmingly 
powerful  Germany.  British  prime  minister  Thatcher  later 
stated  essentially  the  same  view,  calling  for  a  halt  to  the  process 
of  European  union,  whose  final  form  would  inevitably  be  dom- 
inated by  the  Germans.  Indeed,  because  of  its  economic  size 
and  success,  at  the  time  of  unification  Germany  presented  a 
foreboding  economic  appearance  on  the  European  landscape. 

In  principle,  united  Germany  is  not  in  a  position  to  advance 
its  own  agenda  within  the  EU  without  compromise  and  consen- 
sus. On  larger  issues,  approval  by  all  EU  members  is  required. 
On  minor  legislation,  a  weighted  majority  voting  is  applied, 
meaning  that  Germany  has  the  same  number  of  votes  as  France 
or  Britain.  Nevertheless,  few  would  dispute  the  incomparable 
importance  of  German  support  in  the  EU  for  significant  policy 
initiatives.  Likewise,  a  strong  German  effort  to  implement  a 
policy  could  be  opposed  in  practice  only  with  considerable  dif- 
ficulty. 

A  new  German  confidence,  provoking  irritation  from  Ger- 
many's allies  and  partners  within  the  EC,  became  evident  dur- 
ing the  first  years  after  unification.  Member  states  fighting 
recession  in  the  early  1990s  blamed  Germany's  refusal  to  lower 
interest  rates  on  Bonn's  irresponsible  self-absorption  with  its 


448 


Foreign  Relations 


domestic  issues.  Through  tight-fisted  monetary  policies,  critics 
argued,  the  Germans  were  forcing  their  European  neighbors 
to  pay  for  the  high  and  unexpected  costs  of  unification.  The 
United  States  also  called  on  Germany  to  lower  its  interest  rates 
to  stimulate  the  international  economy. 

In  addition  to  economic  disagreements,  Bonn's  policy 
toward  the  Balkans  in  the  second  half  of  1991  provoked 
charges  of  unilateralism  and  strong-arm  tactics  both  within  the 
EC  and  in  Washington,  as  Bonn  attempted  to  convince  its  EC 
partners  and  allies  to  recognize  the  Yugoslav  breakaway  repub- 
lics of  Croatia  and  Slovenia.  A  number  of  European  govern- 
ments, notably  Britain  and  France,  tended  to  view  German 
policy  through  the  lens  of  the  world  wars.  German  policy  was 
not  driven,  however,  by  resurgent  hegemonic  impulses  toward 
the  region,  as  some  critics  argued.  In  fact,  German  motives 
were  varied. 

On  the  one  hand,  Germany  made  it  clear  that  it  wished  to 
see  the  principle  of  self-determination  applied  in  Yugoslavia. 
On  the  other  hand,  domestic  considerations  also  played  an 
important  role.  The  unofficial  lobby  of  several  hundred  thou- 
sand guest  workers  from  Croatia  and  the  millions  of  West  Ger- 
mans who  had  vacationed  in  Zagreb  and  along  Croatia's 
Dalmatian  coast  strongly  expressed  their  horror  at  the  daily 
bloodshed  they  viewed  on  television. 

In  this  context,  and  ignoring  reservations  among  a  number 
of  EC  members,  Germany  unilaterally  recognized  Croatia  and 
Slovenia  before  Christmas  1991.  Germany's  recognition  forced 
the  EC  to  follow  suit  by  January  15,  1992.  The  United  States, 
after  initial  opposition  over  the  recognition  policy,  recognized 
Slovenia,  Croatia,  and  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  in  April  1992. 
These  developments  led  Chancellor  Kohl  to  declare  that  the 
recognitions  represented  a  major  "success  for  German  and 
European  policy."  Some  European  observers  were  left  cha- 
grined, however,  by  what  they  saw  as  the  diplomatic  flexing  of 
united  Germany's  muscles. 

The  Yugoslav  case  aside,  it  had  become  clear  in  the  early 
1990s  that  the  EC's  policy  toward  the  former  Soviet  bloc  would 
be  shaped  to  a  large  extent  by  German  interests.  Germany 
above  all  was  preoccupied  with  fostering  stability  and  prosper- 
ity in  the  region,  especially  in  neighboring  Central  and  Eastern 
Europe.  In  the  early  1990s,  Germany  had  established  itself  as 
the  leading  donor  of  aid,  the  single  largest  investor,  and  the 
most  important  trading  partner  for  the  former  Soviet  bloc.  In 


449 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

addition  to  assisting  democratic  and  market  reforms,  the 
expansion  of  economic  and  commercial  ties  was  of  direct  bene- 
fit to  German  industry. 

In  the  first  years  immediately  after  unification,  Germany 
established  bilateral  agreements  and  treaties  on  good  neigh- 
borly relations  and  friendly  cooperation  with  the  Soviet  Union, 
Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  and  Bulgaria.  In  the  case  of  the  last 
three,  Germany  pledged  to  help  set  up  contacts  with  EU  mem- 
ber states. 

German  policy  makers  soon  began  to  advocate  expanding 
the  EU  by  admitting  northern  and  eastern  European  countries 
as  members.  Germany's  interest  in  this  so-called  "widening"  of 
the  EU  appeared  at  times  in  conflict  with  France's  preference 
for  a  "deepening"  of  the  western  structures  of  the  EU  before 
taking  on  new  members.  In  the  French  view,  new  members, 
including  Austria,  Sweden,  and  Finland,  strengthened  Ger- 
many's hand  in  the  EU  and,  as  a  consequence,  diminished 
France's  influence  in  the  organization. 

Although  it  remained  unclear  in  the  mid-1990s  just  how 
quickly  the  EU  might  expand  in  membership,  it  was  evident 
that  the  EU  would  search  for  ways  to  include  the  emerging 
democracies  in  Central  and  Eastern  Europe.  With  strong  Ger- 
man support,  the  EU  had  begun  to  develop,  for  example,  asso- 
ciation agreements  or  "European  agreements"  that  were 
intended  to  offer  former  communist  countries  access  to  EU 
markets  to  sell  their  goods.  The  EU  also  sought  to  provide  a 
framework  for  economic  and  technical  cooperation  and  for 
political  and  cultural  dialogue. 

At  least  on  a  rhetorical  level,  EU  officials,  in  accord  with  the 
goals  of  the  1957  Treaty  on  the  European  Economic  Commu- 
nity, envisaged  the  gradual  establishment  of  a  free-trade  area 
for  industrial  products.  To  this  end,  the  EU  pledged  to  disman- 
tle barriers  to  the  access  of  industrial  goods  from  Central  and 
East  European  countries  at  a  quicker  pace  than  the  partners 
were  required  to  remove  trade  barriers  to  EU  goods.  This  step 
was  to  be  supplemented,  when  economic  conditions  in  appli- 
cant countries  existed,  by  the  free  movements  of  capital,  ser- 
vices, and  labor.  Legal  foundations  of  the  new  economic 
systems  would  also  be  required  to  conform  with  the  EU  model. 

The  EU's  track  record  of  stubborn  adherence  in  certain 
instances  to  restrictive  trade  practices  (especially  in  the  agricul- 
tural and  textile  sector),  however,  raised  profound  questions 
about  the  feasibility  of  a  smooth  and  relatively  prompt  EU

membership  for  Europe's  developing  democracies.  Nonethe- 
less, in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  a  number  of  analysts  specu- 
lated that  the  Czech  Republic,  Slovakia,  Hungary,  and  Poland 
might  reasonably  expect  EU  membership  by  the  end  of  the 
twentieth  century,  followed  shortly  thereafter  by  Slovenia  and 
the  three  Baltic  states  of  Estonia,  Latvia,  and  Lithuania. 

As  the  EU's  largest  and  economically  strongest  state,  united 
Germany  assumed  an  enhanced  role  in  discussions  about  liber- 
alizing world  trade.  Although  some  signs  had  emerged  in  the 
early  1990s  that  cast  doubt  on  a  successful  conclusion  of  the 
General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT — see  Glos- 
sary) negotiations,  there  were  strong  reasons  to  believe  that 
Germany  would  use  its  influence  to  strengthen  international 
trade  and  thwart  any  moves  that  could  lead  to  transatlantic 
trade  wars  (see  Foreign  Trade  and  Investment,  ch.  6). 

When  the  EU's  generous  price  supports  of  the  Common 
Agricultural  Policy  (CAP — see  Glossary)  came  under  heavy  fire 
from  the  United  States  in  the  GATT  negotiations,  Germany 
and  Britain — leading  food  importers — showed  an  inclination 
to  accept  cuts  in  EU  subsidies.  But  when  Paris  resisted  vehe- 
mently, officials  in  Washington  had  looked  for  a  stronger  Ger- 
man role,  hoping  Bonn  would  exert  greater  pressure  on  its 
neighbor  to  cut  farm  subsidies  and  thereby  overcome  an 
important  stumbling  block  in  the  GATT  talks. 

Germany  itself  was  locked  in  debate  over  the  issue  of  agricul- 
tural policy.  Germany's  free-trade  lobby  was  led  by  the  classi- 
cally liberal  FDP,  which  traditionally  had  one  of  its  members 
serve  as  minister  for  economics.  Kohl  had  shown  himself  sym- 
pathetic to  Germany's  farm  lobby,  and  the  German  govern- 
ment had  traditionally  been  a  strong  defender  of  the  CAP.  The 
German  economy's  dependence  on  foreign  trade  and  invest- 
ment, however,  often  pushed  the  country  toward  pragmatism 
and  compromise  on  trade  issues.  In  the  early  1990s,  Germany 
was  exporting  a  third  of  its  GNP.  In  the  United  States  alone,  it 
held  a  stake  of  US$34  billion  in  direct  investment. 

Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe 

The  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe 
(CSCE),  established  in  1975,  provided  an  organization  whose 
structure  helped  join  West  Germany  and  other  Western  coun- 
tries with  the  emerging  democracies  of  the  former  Soviet  bloc. 
The  CSCE,  renamed  the  Organization  for  Security  and  Coop- 
eration in  Europe  (OSCE)  in  January  1995,  gained  expanded 


451

responsibilities  after  the  end  of  the  Cold  War.  For  Germany,  an 
avid  champion  of  the  organization,  the  OSCE  will  provide  a 
forum  for  greater  inclusion  of  the  former  Warsaw  Pact  coun- 
tries to  discuss  and  coordinate  security  activities. 

Although  NATO  officials  insisted  that  the  OSCE's  role  be 
restricted  to  a  complementary  one  as  concerned  with  the 
West's  defense  alliance,  the  foreign  ministers  of  NATO  mem- 
ber states  had  explicitly  called  for  the  OSCE  to  play  a  more 
prominent  role  in  confidence-building  and  security  coopera- 
tion. In  September  1991,  Genscher  proposed  a  number  of 
ideas  for  expanding  the  CSCE's  capability  and  mandate.  These 
proposals  included  creation  of  a  security  council  and  establish- 
ment of  special  forces  for  peacekeeping  (blue  helmets)  and 
fighting  of  ecological  disasters  (green  helmets).  Germany 
actively  pushed  for  the  development  of  a  conflict  settlement 
procedure  and  for  authorization  for  the  OSCE  to  monitor  the 
compliance  of  member  states  with  human  and  minority  rights 
standards.  It  would  also  use  violations  of  member  states  as  a 
legitimate  condition  for  diplomatic  intervention. 

Germany's  enthusiasm  for  the  OSCE  reflected  the  German 
preoccupation  with  multilateralism,  a  central  theme  in  the 
country's  foreign  policy.  The  powerful  emphasis  on  economic 
relations  in  the  CSCE  process  also  reflected  the  growing  belief 
in  Bonn  that  economic  factors,  rather  than  military  capabili- 
ties, would  be  primary  in  shaping  a  new  European  and  interna- 
tional security  order.  In  this  context,  Bonn  proposed  and 
hosted  the  1990  CSCE  conference  on  economic  cooperation  in 
Europe.  The  Bonn  CSCE  document  provided  a  framework  for 
an  integrated  economic  community  based  on  market  princi- 
ples that  would  stretch  from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Urals. 

Support  for  the  CSCE,  German  officials  argued,  did  not  con- 
flict with  their  government's  commitment  to  other  European 
and  transatlantic  defense  organizations.  On  the  contrary,  if 
appropriate  steps  were  taken  in  the  design  of  a  post-Cold  War 
security  order,  one  would  simply  overlap,  or  neatly  dovetail, 
with  another.  Moves  toward  mechanisms  that  would  strengthen 
Europe's  collective  security  intensified  in  the  first  years  after 
the  breach  of  the  Berlin  Wall. 

As  a  consequence  of  the  November  1990  Paris  Charter  and 
the  July  1992  Helsinki  Summit,  efforts  commenced  to 
strengthen  the  CSCE  process  through  the  establishment  (in 
different  capitals)  of  a  parliamentary  assembly,  a  permanent 
secretariat,  an  election  monitoring  center,  and  a  conflict  pre-

vention  center.  Proponents  championed  the  CSCE  as  the  only 
pan-European  forum  for  the  discussion  of  security  issues.  From 
the  beginning,  however,  skeptics  warned  of  the  limitations  of 
an  organization  encompassing  over  fifty  members — from  Rus- 
sia to  Canada,  and  from  Cyprus  to  the  Vatican — whose 
decision-making  capacity  was  governed  by  a  prerequisite  of 
unanimity  among  its  members.  CSCE  members  undertook  the 
formidable  and,  in  the  view  of  many,  unreasonable  legal  obliga- 
tion "to  provide  mutual  assistance  in  the  case  of  an  attack  from 
the  outside  and  the  duty  to  submit  to  arbitration  in  the  case  of 
local  conflicts." 

The  bickering  and  reservations  over  Maastricht — best  sym- 
bolized by  the  defeat  of  the  treaty  in  Denmark  in  the  summer 
of  1992  and  the  victory  by  a  narrow  margin  in  France  the  fol- 
lowing autumn — disrupted  the  carefully  cultivated  process  of 
European  economic  and  political  unity,  which  had  been  sup- 
ported on  the  continent,  especially  by  policy  makers  in  Ger- 
many and  France.  The  paralysis  of  the  CSCE,  EU,  and  WEU  in 
responding  to  the  fighting  in  the  Balkans  in  1991  and  1992  also 
did  much  to  dampen  earlier  optimism  in  Europe  that  the  EU 
was  on  the  verge  of  forging  a  framework  for  common  foreign 
and  defense  policies.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

United  Nations 

Since  October  3,  1990,  the  day  of  German  unification,  the 
interests  of  Germans  in  the  former  FRG  as  well  as  those  citizens 
in  the  former  GDR  have  been  represented  by  a  single  mission 
in  the  UN.  Although  German  politicians  repeatedly  stated  that 
the  country  was  committed  to  assuming  the  same  rights  and 
responsibilities  as  other  member  states,  Germany  had 
remained  undecided  during  the  first  years  after  unification  as 
to  what  extent  it  would  participate  militarily — under  Article  51 
of  the  UN  Charter — in  collective  security  actions  abroad. 

Although  Germany  supported  the  policy  pursued  by  the 
United  States  and  its  allies — condemnation  of  Iraq's  invasion  of 
Kuwait,  endorsement  of  the  UN's  peace  initiatives,  and  the 
campaign  to  eject  Iraqi  forces  from  Kuwaiti  territory — the  Ger- 
mans did  not  join  combat  missions  in  Operation  Desert  Storm. 
Although  German  participation  in  a  combat  role  was  barred 
primarily  by  legal  constraints,  Germany's  abstention  was 
related  to  other  deeper,  more  complex  issues  as  well.  Many 
Germans  believed  that  an  out-of-area  conflict  such  as  the  Per- 
sian Gulf  War  lay  beyond  the  scope  of  German  interests.  The 
support  of  Germany's  parliament  for  the  war  was  tepid  and  ini- 
tially ambiguous.  Germany's  traumatic  twentieth-century  his- 
tory figured  prominently  in  Bonn's  hesitation. 

Under  pressure  from  the  United  States  and  other  allies,  Ger- 
many agreed  in  the  fall  of  1990  initially  to  contribute  US$2.1 
billion,  together  with  military  equipment  and  munitions,  to  the 
gulf  peacekeeping  force.  Ultimately,  German  financial  contri- 
butions to  the  UN  for  the  Persian  Gulf  War  totaled  about 
US$10  billion. 

Nevertheless,  Germany  remains  committed  to  the  UN's  use 
of  military  force.  In  his  first  address  to  the  UN  General  Assem- 
bly on  September  23,  1992,  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  Kinkel 
pledged  that  his  country  would  support  the  UN's  system  of  col- 
lective security.  In  his  address,  Kinkel  stated  that  it  was  essential 
that  "democracies  .  .  .  remain  capable  of  defending  them- 
selves," even  though  the  East-West  conflict  had  been  relegated 
to  history.  Kinkel  maintained  that  the  collective  security  system 
of  the  UN  and  regional  arrangements  such  as  the  CSCE  should 
be  transformed  into  "powerful  instruments  of  a  new  world 
domestic  policy." 

In  the  mid-1990s,  German  policy  is  that  the  country  will  con- 
tinue to  participate  in  peacekeeping  missions.  The  German 
government  continues  to  support  the  general  outlines  of  UN 


454 


Foreign  Relations 


policies  and  programs  on  humanitarian  relief,  developmental 
assistance,  and  environmental  protection.  However,  statesmen 
from  United  States  president  Bush  to  UN  secretary  general  Jav- 
ier Perez  de  Cuellar  (and  later  his  successor  Boutros  Boutros- 
Ghali),  have  called  for  Germany  to  accept  greater  responsibil- 
ity in  world  affairs  by  making  use  of  not  just  its  financial 
resources,  but  of  its  political  and  military  capabilities  as  well. 

Despite  the  fact  that  Germany  has  not  yet  resolved  key  ques- 
tions about  its  international  role,  and  specifically  its  contribu- 
tions to  peacemaking  efforts,  German  politicians  have  already 
begun  to  suggest  that  the  united  country,  presumably  along 
with  Japan,  be  considered  for  permanent  membership  on  the 
UN  Security  Council.  One  school  argues  that  a  permanent  seat 
is  consistent  with  Germany's  growing  power  and  influence  and 
the  reconfiguration  of  world  politics  five  decades  after  the  end 
of  World  War  II.  Others  contend  that  Germany's  attainment  of 
a  permanent  seat  will  occur  only  if  states  from  Asia,  Latin 
America,  and  Africa  join  as  well.  Because  such  expansion 
would  have  the  effect  of  weakening  the  leadership  role  of  the 
Security  Council  and  thus  the  UN  as  a  whole,  many  of  these 
commentators  reject  the  idea  of  permanent  Security  Council 
membership  for  Germany.

Chapter  9.  National  Security 


of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany 


THE  FEDERAL  ARMED  FORCES  (Bundeswehr)  of  the  Fed- 
eral Republic  of  Germany  (FRG,  or  West  Germany)  came  into 
being  in  1955.  Assigned  a  solely  defensive  role,  the 
Bundeswehr  at  its  creation  constituted  the  largest  component 
of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO — see  Glos- 
sary) ground  forces  in  Central  Europe.  Throughout  the  Cold 
War,  the  fighter  aircraft  and  air  defense  missiles  of  the 
Bundeswehr's  formidable  air  force  came  under  NATO  com- 
mand, and  the  small,  well-equipped  West  German  navy  was 
committed  to  NATO  missions  in  the  Baltic  and  North  seas. 
NATO  carefully  delineated  the  Bundeswehr's  missions;  in 
effect,  West  German  security  objectives  were  identical  with 
those  of  the  Alliance. 

By  mid-1995,  however,  the  Bundeswehr,  numbering  approxi- 
mately 368,000  troops,  had  been  through  a  radical  restructur- 
ing and  downsizing  brought  about  by  the  sudden  end  of  the 
Cold  War  and  the  collapse  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  (see  Glossary) 
and  the  Soviet  empire.  After  Germany  was  united  in  October 
1990  by  the  accession  of  the  German  Democratic  Republic 
(GDR,  or  East  Germany)  to  the  Federal  Republic,  the 
Bundeswehr  absorbed  some  of  the  personnel  and  equipment 
of  the  East  German  armed  forces,  the  National  People's  Army 
(Nationale  Volksarmee — NVA) ,  in  a  unique  merger  of  two  for- 
merly hostile  militaries  that  had  been  unimaginable  even  one 
year  earlier. 

Prior  to  unification,  the  armed  forces  of  East  and  West  Ger- 
many were  considered  among  the  shock  troops  of  their  respec- 
tive alliances.  The  leaders  of  NATO  and  the  Warsaw  Pact —  the 
United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union,  respectively — each  main- 
tained powerful  forces  based  in  the  two  Germanys,  the  pre- 
sumed battleground.  In  terms  of  tactics,  force  organization  and 
structure,  and  equipment,  superpower  influence  on  each  Ger- 
man military  was  pervasive.  On  the  Soviet  side,  with  more  than 
400,000  troops,  the  Group  of  Soviet  Forces  in  Germany 
(GSFG)  was  far  larger  than  the  NVA  itself  and  was  the  Warsaw 
Pact's  most  potent  military  force  outside  the  Soviet  Union.  The 
United  States  was  clearly  the  most  important  member  of 
NATO,  but  only  a  small  portion  of  its  total  military  forces  were 
stationed  in  West  Germany  or  in  Europe.  Unification  changed 
the  Bundeswehr's  situation  dramatically  and  in  the  process 


459 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

added  about  30  percent  more  territory  and  hundreds  of  kilo- 
meters of  Baltic  Sea  coastline  to  the  task  of  preserving  the  terri- 
torial integrity  of  the  enlarged  country. 

Paving  the  way  for  unification  and  restoration  of  full  sover- 
eignty, an  agreement  with  Moscow  in  July  1990  committed  Ger- 
many to  reducing  its  armed  forces  to  a  level  of  370,000  by 
December  1994  in  return  for  the  complete  withdrawal  of  all 
troops  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  in  eastern  Germany  by  the 
end  of  that  year.  Initial  Soviet  objections  to  unified  Germany's 
membership  in  NATO  were  dropped  when  Germany  agreed  to 
finance  the  relocation  and  housing  of  the  departing  troops. 
Under  the  1990  Conventional  Forces  in  Europe  Treaty  (CFE 
Treaty — see  Glossary),  Germany  also  undertook  to  make  mas- 
sive cuts  in  its  weapons  inventory.  But  even  after  these  reduc- 
tions, the  Federal  Republic  would  still  possess  the  largest 
European  forces  in  NATO. 

Since  World  War  II,  the  prospect  of  an  independent  German 
military  had  been  a  source  of  anxiety  both  within  West  Ger- 
many and  among  its  former  foes  and  neighbors.  In  addition, 
German  irredentist  claims  had  led  to  war  in  the  past.  So  it  was 
only  after  Germany  publicly  and  officially  recognized  the  valid- 
ity of  its  existing  borders  that  Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  and  the 
Soviet  Union  consented  to  the  idea  of  German  unification. 

Traditional  German  militarism  has  been  tempered  in  the 
Bundeswehr,  which  remains  a  part  of  society  rather  than  a  soci- 
ety unto  itself.  The  officer  corps  has  not  become  an  elite,  as  it 
had  previously.  Every  member  of  the  armed  forces  retains  indi- 
vidual rights  as  a  citizen  and  enjoys  liberties  unavailable  to 
United  States  troops,  such  as  the  right  to  join  a  union  or  run 
for  public  office  while  in  the  service.  In  the  Bundeswehr,  sexual 
orientation  has  not  been  a  contentious  issue.  Female  citizens  of 
the  Federal  Republic  interested  in  a  military  career  are,  how- 
ever, restricted  to  service  in  the  medical  and  musical  corps. 

Although  a  powerful  peace  movement  uniting  environmen- 
talists, students,  trade  unionists,  and  religious  leaders  articu- 
lated pacifist  and  antimilitarist  positions  with  some  success  in 
the  postwar  period,  the  armed  forces  continues  to  be  staffed 
largely  by  conscription.  About  40  percent  of  the  troops  are 
draftees;  the  remainder  are  regulars  or  extended-service  volun- 
teers. In  1972  the  term  of  service  was  reduced  from  eighteen 
months  to  fifteen  months;  in  1990  it  was  further  reduced  to 
twelve  months;  beginning  in  1996,  it  will  fall  to  ten  months. 
Thousands  of  young  men  have  been  exempted  or  had  their 


460 


National  Security 


service  deferred  for  educational,  health,  or  hardship  reasons. 
A  growing  number  of  young  men  (60,000  of  200,000  called) 
are  granted  conscientious  objector  status.  These  men  perform 
alternative  service  (Ersatzdienst)  in  hospitals  or  homes  for 
senior  citizens  or  for  people  with  disabilities.  Those  aspiring  to 
become  officers  or  noncommissioned  officers  (NCOs)  are 
required  to  enter  as  conscripts  before  volunteering  for  longer 
enlistments.  Only  the  most  qualified  are  permitted  to  undergo 
the  rigorous  preparation  for  a  full  career  in  the  armed  services. 

Because  the  West  German  armed  forces  had  been  so  subor- 
dinated to  NATO — an  alliance  in  search  of  a  new  identity  and 
mission  in  the  1990s — the  Bundeswehr  of  united  Germany  has 
experienced  difficulty  in  defining  its  missions  and  justifying  the 
need  for  a  large  and  costly  military  establishment.  Until  July 
1994,  Germany's  constitution,  the  Basic  Law,  had  been  inter- 
preted as  prohibiting  the  deployment  of  German  forces  out- 
side the  NATO  area  in  United  Nations  (UN)  or  other  inter- 
national peacemaking  and  peacekeeping  operations.  Conse- 
quently, despite  pressure  from  some  allies,  no  German  troops 
were  included  in  the  UN  coalition  that  fought  Iraq  in  the  1991 
Persian  Gulf  War.  Instead,  Germany  made  financial  contribu- 
tions to  the  action,  and  some  German  units  were  deployed  to 
Turkey  as  a  defensive  measure.  German  soldiers  joined  human- 
itarian operations  in  the  former  Yugoslavia  and  in  Somalia,  but 
the  opposition  Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany  (Sozial- 
demokratische  Partei  Deutschlands — SPD)  strenuously 
opposed  involvement  that  could  bring  German  forces  into 
combat.  In  July  1994,  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court,  the 
highest  court  in  the  land,  ruled  that  the  Bundeswehr  could 
participate  in  international  military  operations  if  each  deploy- 
ment received  approval  in  the  Bundestag,  the  lower  house  of 
Germany's  parliament. 

In  unified  Germany,  the  maintenance  of  internal  security  is 
for  the  most  part  the  responsibility  of  the  individual  police 
forces  of  the  sixteen  states  (Lander;  sing.,  Land),  controlled  by 
the  individual  ministries  of  interior  of  the  Lander.  This  decen- 
tralized system  has  its  roots  in  the  post-1871  German  Empire. 
The  Western  Allies  after  World  War  II  insisted  on  a  return  to 
the  Land  system  because  of  abuses  by  Hitler's  highly  centralized 
police  forces  during  the  Nazi  era  (1933-45).  To  an  increasing 
extent,  Land  police  activities  are  coordinated  and  supported  by 
the  federal  Ministry  of  Interior,  which  has  its  own  criminal 
police  agency  and  domestic  intelligence  services.  The  paramili-

tary  border  police  is  available  as  a  uniformed  federal  backup 
force  in  the  event  of  major  disorders. 

In  the  early  1990s,  controversy  and  scandal  erupted  over  the 
opening  of  the  records  of  the  former  East  German  State  Secu- 
rity Service  (Staatssicherheitsdienst — Stasi).  Former  dissidents 
and  political  figures  were  discredited  by  revelations  of  dealings 
with  the  Stasi,  whose  repressive  influence  had  permeated  most 
aspects  of  life  in  the  former  GDR.  As  a  result,  police  forces  of 
the  five  new  Lander  underwent  restructuring  and  retraining  to 
bring  them  up  to  the  level  of  competency  of  Western  police 
forces. 

Beginning  in  the  late  1960s,  the  danger  of  violence  by  terror- 
ist groups  has  been  a  chronic  problem  for  the  police.  After  uni- 
fication in  1990,  the  principal  threat  to  public  order  shifted 
from  left-wing  extremists  to  right-wing  and  neo-Nazi  groups 
that  targeted  the  growing  numbers  of  asylum-seekers,  as  well  as 
the  millions  of  foreign  workers,  many  of  whom  had  been 
employed  in  Germany  for  decades.  Federal  authorities 
responded  to  criticism  that  law  enforcement  agencies  and 
courts  were  lax  in  dealing  with  right-wing  violence  by  strength- 
ening federal-Land  cooperation  and  acting  more  aggressively 
to  curb  extremist  incidents. 

In  the  1990s,  Germany's  security  forces  are  experiencing 
their  share  of  the  confusion  and  disarray  brought  about  by  the 
hastily  executed  process  of  unification.  For  nearly  half  a  cen- 
tury, two  radically  different  societies  had  evolved  in  the  two 
Germanys.  In  the  east,  under  Soviet  occupation,  an  aggressive 
campaign  of  early  indoctrination  and  militarization  was  intro- 
duced. Overlapping  premilitary  and  paramilitary  organizations 
perpetuated  antagonism  toward  NATO,  West  Germany,  the 
United  States,  and  the  free-market  system.  Initiative  was  stifled, 
and  obedience  was  demanded.  When  the  communist  system 
collapsed,  the  superstructure  upon  which  it  relied  (armed 
forces,  police,  and  border  guards)  was  discredited.  Meanwhile, 
in  the  West,  support  for  NATO  and  the  United  States  troop 
presence  fell  as  the  threat  diminished,  and  growing  numbers  of 
German  youth  opted  for  alternative  service. 

Military  Tradition 
Early  History 

The  first  Germans  to  win  repute  as  fearsome  adversaries  in 
combat  were  members  of  the  various  tribes  who  fought  the 


462 


National  Security 


encroachment  of  Roman  legions  upon  their  territories.  The 
Roman  historian  Tacitus  praised  the  leadership  and  military 
acumen  of  Arminius,  a  chief  of  the  Cherusci  who  commanded 
the  German  forces  in  the  Battle  of  the  Teutoburg  Forest  in 
A.D.  9.  The  tribal  warriors  led  by  Arminius  annihilated  three 
Roman  legions,  effectively  preventing  Roman  expansion 
beyond  the  Danube  and  Rhine  rivers.  By  the  fifth  century,  Ger- 
man tribes  had  entered  the  Italian  peninsula  and  brought 
about  the  collapse  of  the  Roman  Empire  in  the  west. 

The  empire  created  by  Charlemagne  (r.  768-814)  in  west- 
central  Europe  split  up  soon  after  his  death,  the  eastern  por- 
tion occupying  much  of  the  territory  of  modern  Germany. 
These  German  lands  gradually  evolved  into  the  Holy  Roman 
Empire,  with  extensive  territories  in  Italy  (see  Medieval  Ger- 
many, ch.  1).  Many  of  the  German  kingdoms,  principalities, 
and  cities  that  were  components  of  the  empire  were  noted  for 
the  emphasis  their  leaders  placed  on  military  might.  However, 
no  imperial  army  or  law  held  sway  over  the  local  princes  and 
free  cities.  The  absence  of  a  strong  central  power,  plus  the 
emergence  of  Protestantism  in  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth 
centuries,  resulted  in  a  near-permanent  state  of  civil  conflict, 
wars  of  succession,  and  religious  strife  (see  The  Protestant  Ref- 
ormation, ch.  1).  The  Thirty  Years'  War  (1618-48),  a  series  of 
conflicts  between  Protestant  and  Catholic  forces,  decimated 
Germany's  population  (see  The  Thirty  Years'  War,  ch.  1). 

Prussia's  Emergence  as  a  Military  Power 

After  the  decline  of  the  Holy  Roman  Empire,  the  Kingdom 
of  Prussia  eventually  emerged  as  the  dominant  power  in  cen- 
tral Europe  (see  The  Age  of  Enlightened  Absolutism,  1648- 
1789,  ch.  1).  Prussia  had  been  colonized  and  Germanized  dur- 
ing the  thirteenth  and  fourteenth  centuries  by  the  Knights  of 
the  Teutonic  Order,  a  military  order  of  German  monks  that 
pushed  back  or  overran  the  Slavs  in  the  area.  The  knights  were 
crushed  by  the  Poles  and  Lithuanians  in  1410  at  the  Battle  of 
Tannenberg,  but  in  the  next  century  the  Hohenzollern 
Dynasty  that  ruled  Brandenburg  and  made  Berlin  its  residence 
was  able  to  win  control  over  West  Prussia,  Silesia,  Pomerania, 
and  eventually  much  of  the  Rhineland  and  Westphalia. 

The  German  military  heritage  was  epitomized  by  a  succes- 
sion of  Prussian  rulers  in  the  seventeenth  and  eighteenth  cen- 
turies. The  first  of  these  was  the  Great  Elector,  Frederick 
William  (r.  1640-88),  who  recognized  that  a  standing  army 


463 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

with  an  elite  officer  corps  was  the  key  to  the  development  of  a 
powerful  state  in  his  remote  part  of  the  empire.  His  grandson, 
Frederick  William  I  (r.  1713-40),  more  than  doubled  the  size 
of  his  professional  army  to  90,000  and  added  a  trained  reserve 
of  conscripted  peasants,  forming  one  of  the  most  modern  and 
efficient  fighting  units  in  eighteenth-century  Europe.  Heavy 
taxes  supported  the  army,  which  consumed  80  percent  of  state 
revenues  even  in  peacetime.  The  next  Prussian  king,  Frederick 
II  (r.  1740-86),  known  to  posterity  as  Frederick  the  Great, 
raised  the  strength  of  the  army  to  150,000  and  launched  a 
series  of  wars  between  1740  and  1763,  wresting  control  of  the 
province  of  Silesia  from  Habsburg  Austria.  Prussia  had  become 
one  of  the  most  powerful  continental  states  and  a  contender 
with  the  Habsburgs  for  domination  over  the  myriad  German 
political  entities. 

The  aristocratic  character  of  the  officer  corps  was  estab- 
lished early  in  the  eighteenth  century  as  Prussian  kings  tried  to 
gain  the  support  of  wealthy  landed  aristocrats,  known  as  Junk- 
ers, by  granting  them  a  virtual  monopoly  over  the  selection  of 
officers.  In  1733  a  cadet  school  was  established  in  Berlin  to 
train  sons  of  Junkers  to  be  officers.  The  officer  corps  was  well 
on  the  way  to  becoming  the  most  privileged  social  class  in  Prus- 
sia. 

The  chauvinistic  militarism  of  Prussia  inspired  fear  and 
hatred  among  other  European  states  and  peoples.  Under  the 
strong  leadership  of  a  self-perpetuating  general  staff,  the  army 
brooked  little  interference  in  its  affairs  by  the  civil  government. 
Nevertheless,  the  failure  to  reform  and  the  lack  of  prepared- 
ness after  the  death  of  Frederick  the  Great  in  1786  led  to  the 
army's  decisive  defeat  by  Napoleon's  forces  at  Jena  in  October 
1806. 

Over  the  next  few  years,  General  Gerhard  von  Scharnhorst 
guided  the  revitalization  of  the  army.  Reforms  included  the 
introduction  of  universal  military  service  and  an  end  to  depen- 
dence on  mercenaries.  The  officer  corps  was  expanded  to 
include  commoners,  and  officers  were  encouraged  to  take 
greater  initiative  in  battle.  The  new  Prussian  army  distin- 
guished itself  at  the  Battle  of  Leipzig  in  1813  and  again  at 
Waterloo  in  1815,  where,  under  the  command  of  Field  Marshal 
Gebhard  von  Blucher,  the  army  was  instrumental  in  the  ulti- 
mate defeat  of  Napoleon. 

Prussia's  reputation  for  military  efficiency  was  reestablished 
by  the  army's  final  victories  over  Napoleon.  The  Prussian  War 


464 


National  Security 


College  (Kriegsakademie)  became  a  model  for  military  staff 
colleges  around  the  world  in  the  early  nineteenth  century.  A 
book  of  that  era — On  War — written  by  Karl  von  Clausewitz,  a 
Prussian  general,  became  a  classic,  its  theories  of  land  warfare 
still  studied  by  officers  of  many  armies  more  than  160  years 
after  the  author's  death. 

The  unification  of  the  many  German  states  into  the  German 
Empire  (1871-1918)  followed  Prussian-led  victories  over  Den- 
mark in  1864,  Austria  in  1866,  and  France  in  1870-71.  Prussia's 
aggressive  policies  were  masterminded  by  Otto  von  Bismarck, 
who  became  united  Germany's  first  chancellor  (see  Bismarck 
and  Unification,  ch.  1).  Following  unification,  the  legendary 
Prussian  General  Staff  became  the  German  General  Staff. 
Clausewitz's  dictum  that  civilians  should  control  the  military 
was  ignored,  and  the  General  Staff  became  a  power  center  in 
the  highly  militaristic  regimes  of  Kaiser  Wilhelm  I  (1858-88) 
and  Kaiser  Wilhelm  II  (1888-1918)  (see  Imperial  Germany,  ch. 
1). 

The  German  Military  in  Two  World  Wars 

Prussian-German  excellence  in  military  matters  was  an 
accepted  fact  of  life,  but  in  the  twentieth  century  the  excessive 
accent  on  militarism  led  to  two  disastrous  world  wars.  Ger- 
many's insistence  on  building  a  fleet  that  could  challenge  Brit- 
ain's naval  domination  underscored  German  bellicosity  and 
pushed  Britain  toward  alignment  with  France  and  Russia. 
When  World  War  I  broke  out  in  1914,  Germany  attempted  to 
conquer  France  quickly  with  a  sudden  thrust  through  Belgium. 
The  Germans  nearly  reached  Paris,  but  the  desperate  French 
managed  to  stiffen  their  defenses  along  the  Marne  River.  The 
front  was  stabilized  in  northern  France  and  shifted  little  during 
the  course  of  the  war  in  spite  of  the  sacrifice  of  whole  armies  in 
the  effort  to  break  through  opposing  defenses.  Although  Ger- 
many was  able  to  force  Russia  out  of  the  war  in  March  1918,  the 
arrival  of  fresh  United  States  troops,  strikes  and  protests  among 
German  workers,  and  the  exhaustion  of  material  resources 
brought  about  Germany's  collapse  in  November  1918.  General 
Erich  Ludendorff  and  Field  Marshal  Paul  von  Hindenburg 
formed  what  was  in  effect  a  military  dictatorship  in  1917  but 
sidestepped  responsibility  for  the  military  catastrophe  by 
restoring  civilian  control  in  the  chaos  of  1918.  They  then  falsely 
claimed  that  the  military,  undefeated  in  the  field,  had  been 


465 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

"stabbed  in  the  back"  by  domestic  enemies,  a  charge  that  Adolf 
Hitler  employed  later  to  great  effect. 

Under  the  terms  of  the  Treaty  of  Versailles,  the  German 
General  Staff  was  abolished.  The  army  was  limited  to  100,000 
personnel  and  the  navy  to  a  force  of  15,000.  Aircraft,  tanks, 
submarines,  and  other  offensive  weapons  were  prohibited.  The 
left  bank  of  the  Rhine  was  demilitarized.  The  Allies  intended 
that  the  civilian  government  of  the  postwar  Weimar  Republic 
(1918-33)  completely  control  the  military  and  that  the 
destruction  of  the  General  Staff  epitomize  the  end  of  Prussian- 
ism.  Nevertheless,  a  general  staff  continued  to  function  under 
the  sobriquet  "Troop  Office,"  and  its  leaders  took  advantage  of 
the  weak  civilian  government  to  reassert  their  privileged  posi- 
tions. When  Hindenburg  was  elected  president  of  the  republic 
in  1925,  the  general  staff  officers  regained  their  influence  in 
the  government  (see  The  Weimar  Republic,  1918-33,  ch.  1). 

During  the  1920s,  a  clandestine  alliance  was  formed  between 
the  armies  of  the  Weimar  Republic  and  the  Soviet  Union  to  cir- 
cumvent the  terms  of  the  Treaty  of  Versailles.  The  German 
high  command  under  General  Hans  von  Seeckt  made  secret 
arrangements  with  the  Soviet  high  command  enabling  German 
officers  and  specialists  to  study  and  train  with  modern  weapons 
in  the  Soviet  Union  in  return  for  German  technical  assistance 
in  the  establishment  of  Soviet  defense  industries.  This  collabo- 
ration helped  keep  alive  the  military  know-how  used  later  as 
the  basis  of  Hitler's  war  machine. 

By  September  1939,  when  Hitler's  invasion  of  Poland  trig- 
gered World  War  II,  Germany  had  a  formidable  army,  a  potent 
navy,  and  the  best  equipped  air  force  in  the  world.  The  blitz- 
krieg (lightning  war),  in  which  highly  mobile,  tank-heavy  land 
armies  were  deployed  in  conjunction  with  large  numbers  of 
close-support  aircraft,  included  tactics  never  before  seen  in 
warfare.  In  the  spring  of  1940,  the  German  army,  the  Wehr- 
macht,  defeated  Denmark  and  Norway,  outflanked  French 
defenses  along  the  Maginot  Line,  destroyed  the  armies  of 
France  and  Belgium,  and  forced  the  evacuation  of  the  British 
Expeditionary  Forces  at  Dunkirk — all  in  a  little  over  a  month. 

The  rapid  victories  of  the  early  war  period  did  not  lead  to 
peace,  however.  France,  Belgium,  the  Netherlands,  Denmark, 
Norway,  and  Poland  were  occupied,  but  the  staunch  resistance 
of  Britain's  Royal  Air  Force  deterred  Hitler's  planned  invasion 
of  Britain.  The  war  took  on  a  global  character  in  1941,  with  the 
Wehrmacht's  invasion  of  its  erstwhile  ally,  the  Soviet  Union,  in

June  and  Japan's  attack  on  Pearl  Harbor  the  following  Decem- 
ber, which  drew  the  United  States  into  the  conflict.  Even 
though  the  redoubtable  Nazi  war  machine  fought  on  for 
almost  four  more  years,  the  resources  and  manpower  that  the 
Allies  could  invest  eventually  sealed  the  fate  of  Hitler's  vaunted 
"Thousand-Year  Reich." 

Once  the  Soviet  forces  were  able  to  turn  the  tide  in  their 
favor  on  the  Eastern  Front  and  the  Western  Allies  established 
themselves  in  France,  there  could  no  longer  be  any  doubt 
about  the  outcome  of  the  war.  Nevertheless,  Hitler  refused  to 
seek  peace.  The  inevitable  result  was  the  destruction  not  only 
of  the  country's  armed  forces  but  also  of  its  towns  and  cities,  its 
industrial  capacity,  and  its  transportation  system.  Despite  this 
second  catastrophic  defeat  in  fewer  than  thirty  years,  the  Ger- 
man reputation  for  military  excellence  survived.  The  defeats 
could  be  attributed  to  strategic  blunders,  two-front  wars,  and 
madness  and  depravity  among  the  Nazi  leadership. 

The  Allies  demanded  and  received  Nazi  Germany's  uncondi- 
tional surrender  in  May  1945.  Two  months  later,  at  a  summit 
conference  held  at  Potsdam,  near  Berlin,  the  leaders  of  the 
United  States,  Britain,  and  the  Soviet  Union  decreed,  inter  alia, 
the  demilitarization  of  Germany.  Although  the  Allies  disagreed 
on  many  issues  discussed  at  Potsdam,  they  were  in  accord  on 
the  need  to  prevent  a  resurgence  of  German  militarism;  toward 
that  end,  they  ordered  total  disarmament.  In  the  immediate 
postwar  years,  however,  the  Allies  could  not  agree  on  the  terms 
of  a  peace  treaty,  and  before  long  they  were  aligning  on  oppo- 
site sides  of  the  Cold  War.  By  1949  the  British,  French,  and 
United  States  zones  of  occupation  had  become  West  Germany, 
and  the  Soviet  zone  had  become  East  Germany.  The  border 
between  the  two  republics  became  the  front  line  of  the  Cold 
War,  or,  in  the  term  popularized  by  Winston  Churchill,  the 
Iron  Curtain.  Soon,  uniformed  Germans  carrying  weapons 
were  appearing  on  both  sides  of  the  border  (see  Postwar  Occu- 
pation and  Division,  ch.  2). 

Creation  of  the  Bundeswehr 

In  the  summer  of  1955,  ten  years  after  the  Nazi  surrender 
and  the  end  of  World  War  II,  the  West  German  Bundestag 
(lower  house  of  parliament)  voted  to  authorize  the  recruit- 
ment of  volunteers  for  the  initial  formation  of  the  Bundeswehr 
(Federal  Armed  Forces).  Later  in  the  year,  a  cadre  of  about  100 
officers  and  NCOs  were  sworn  in  at  a  ceremony  in  Bonn.  Most 


467 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

of  the  initial  volunteers  were  veterans  of  the  World  War  II 
Wehrmacht  who  had  been  serving  in  the  Federal  Border  Force 
(Bundesgrenzschutz — BGS)  since  the  inception  of  that  lightly 
armed  organization  in  1951  (see  Federal  Police  Agencies,  this 
ch.). 

Training  facilities  and  equipment  were  made  available  by  the 
United  States  Army,  and  1,500  volunteers  reported  for  the  first 
training  cycle,  which  began  in  January  1956.  The  Bundestag 
soon  promulgated  compulsory  military  service.  By  the  end  of 
the  year,  the  force  numbered  about  65,000,  including  10,000 
volunteers  from  the  BGS,  almost  all  of  whom  were  war  veter- 
ans. The  reappearance  of  a  German  armed  force,  which  would 
have  been  inconceivable  a  decade  earlier,  had  become  a  reality 
as  a  direct  result  of  the  Cold  War. 

The  London  and  Paris  agreements  of  1954  restored  sover- 
eignty to  the  Federal  Republic  and  opened  the  way  for  German 
membership  in  NATO.  The  four  Allies  retained  occupation 
powers  in  Berlin.  Allied  troops  remained  in  West  Germany  for 
purposes  of  NATO  defense  pursuant  to  status-of-forces  agree- 
ments. With  the  exception  of  French  troops,  Allied  and  Ger- 
man forces  were  under  NATO's  joint  defense  command. 

In  East  Germany,  the  national  legislature  passed  a  bill  estab- 
lishing the  armed  forces  and  the  Ministry  of  Defense  in  Janu- 
ary 1956.  The  swift  creation  of  an  East  German  armed  forces, 
the  National  People's  Army  (Nationale  Volksarmee — NVA), 
more  than  120,000  personnel  practicing  Prussian-style  drill, 
was  a  dramatic  gesture  of  nationalism  impossible  for  the  world 
to  ignore.  Thus,  the  1950s  saw  both  Germanys  embark  upon 
the  reestablishment  of  their  military  forces,  albeit  ones  firmly 
restrained  within  the  mutually  antagonistic  Cold  War  alliances. 

Strategic  Concerns  and  Military  Missions 

Until  the  late  1980s,  the  Federal  Republic  was  confronted  by 
a  single  preponderant  threat  arising  from  the  forward  deploy- 
ment of  armored  and  highly  maneuverable  Soviet  and  Warsaw 
Pact  forces.  The  threat  to  NATO  and  to  Germany  abated  after 
the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  phased  withdrawal 
during  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  of  Soviet  (and,  later,  Russian) 
units  from  the  former  East  Germany  and  from  other  Warsaw 
Pact  nations. 

Instead  of  having  to  prepare  for  the  contingency  of  direct 
attack  from  the  east,  a  united  Germany  faces  more  diffuse  and 
intangible  security  problems.  Under  the  new  conditions,  Ger-

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

many's  concerns  focus  on  the  possibility  of  armed  conflicts  aris- 
ing in  any  one  of  three  regions.  The  first  is  in  the  former  Soviet 
Union,  where  fifteen  former  Soviet  republics,  several  of  them 
with  powerful  conventional  forces  and  even  nuclear  capabili- 
ties, are  undergoing  a  difficult  transition  to  independent 
nationhood.  Second,  in  Eastern  Europe,  the  disintegration  of 
communist  rule  and  the  problems  of  the  fragile  democratic  sys- 
tems that  followed  have  also  created  the  potential  for  danger- 
ous upheaval.  Historical  animosities  previously  suppressed 
under  an  authoritarian  regime  have  already  brought  civil  war 
to  the  former  Yugoslavia.  Ethnic  or  religious  violence  could 
easily  break  out  elsewhere  in  the  region,  producing  destabiliz- 
ing conditions,  including  the  arrival  of  waves  of  refugees. 
Finally,  German  military  planners  also  foresee  possible  conflict 
in  the  volatile  area  extending  from  the  southern  rim  of  the 
Mediterranean  to  the  Persian  Gulf.  In  this  region,  the  emer- 
gence of  fundamentalist  or  radical  regimes  poses  a  potential 
threat  to  NATO  member  states  such  as  Turkey,  which  could 
lead  to  a  call  for  German  force  deployments. 

The  primary  mission  of  the  German  armed  forces  remains 
the  protection  of  German  territory  in  conjunction  with  other 
NATO  armies.  This  task  would  fall  to  NATO's  main  defense 
forces,  which,  under  guidelines  adopted  in  1991,  will  constitute 
the  bulk  of  NATO  forces  in  Central  Europe.  The  main  defense 
forces  will  consist  of  four  multinational  corps,  only  partially 
mobilized  in  peacetime.  Two  corps  will  be  under  German  com- 
mand, and  German  divisions  will  also  be  assigned  to  the 
remaining  corps  commands.  NATO's  Rapid  Reaction  Force  will 
be  available  to  assume  regional  crisis  management  and  to  take 
limited  action  in  either  Central  Europe  or  elsewhere  in  the 
NATO  area.  The  force  will  also  provide  protection  during  the 
buildup  of  the  main  defense  forces.  Germany's  contribution  to 
the  Rapid  Reaction  Force  will  include  its  operationally  ready 
combat  brigades.  The  air  component  of  the  Rapid  Reaction 
Force  will  include  twenty  aircraft  squadrons  under  the  com- 
mand of  a  German  officer. 

In  addition  to  maintaining  NATO-committed  combat  units, 
the  evolving  Bundeswehr  will  retain  support  forces  to  provide 
military  infrastructure  and  logistics,  training  units  and  schools,

required  to  have  contingents  ready  to  conduct  peacetime  mis- 
sions of  disaster  relief,  search  and  rescue,  and  humanitarian 
assistance.  German  commanders  also  must  plan  for  possible

deployments  in  support  of  out-of-area  NATO  or  UN  operations 
(see  International  Military  Missions,  this  ch.;  The  Out-of-Area 
Debate,  ch.  8). 

The  Armed  Forces 

Command  and  Control 

Under  the  Basic  Law,  the  federal  minister  of  defense  com- 
mands the  Bundeswehr  in  peacetime,  but  that  official  relin- 
quishes this  role  to  the  federal  chancellor  in  the  event  of  a 
"state  of  defense,"  that  is,  an  outbreak  of  hostilities.  The  Minis- 
try of  Defense  is  traditionally  headed  by  a  civilian  and  assisted 
by  two  parliamentary  state  secretaries  and  two  state  secretaries. 
There  are  six  nonmilitary  divisions  staffed  primarily  by  civil- 
ians— personnel;  budget;  administrative  and  legal  affairs;  quar- 
termaster, real  estate,  and  construction;  social  services;  and 
armaments.  The  military  side  of  the  ministry  is  composed  of 
five  military  staffs — the  armed  forces  office,  army,  navy,  air 
force,  and  surgeon  general  (see  fig.  14). 

The  top  military  position  is  that  of  General  Inspekteur  of  the 
armed  forces,  an  individual  who  is  roughly  equivalent  to  the 
United  States  chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff.  The  General 
Inspekteur  is  the  supreme  military  representative  of  the 
Bundeswehr  and  military  adviser  to  the  minister  of  defense. 
The  General  Inspekteur 's  planning  responsibilities  require  him  to 
develop  overall  concepts  governing  the  structure,  organiza- 
tion, command  and  control,  equipment,  and  training  of  the 
Bundeswehr.  The  General  Inspekteur  also  represents  the 
Bundeswehr  in  international  bodies.  However,  he  is  not  part  of 
the  chain  of  operational  command  between  the  minister  and 
the  chief  of  staff  ("inspector")  of  each  branch  of  the  armed 
forces. 

The  Bundeswehr  has  no  general  staff.  Because  of  its  tainted 
history  and  condemnation  at  the  Nuremberg  trials,  that  partic- 
ular structure  was  omitted  when  the  Bundeswehr  was  being 
planned.  Non-NATO  joint  planning  is  conducted  by  represen- 
tatives from  the  Bundeswehr  and  the  service  general  staffs 
under  the  overall  supervision  of  the  Bundeswehr's  Operations 
Directorate.  The  staffs  of  the  army,  air  force,  and  navy  are 
responsible  for  the  operational  readiness  of  their  respective 
force  components.  They  are  involved  in  the  coordination  and 
approval  processes  of  NATO  plans  for  the  defense  of  German 
territory  but  do  not  undertake  operational  wartime  planning.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Because  Germany  will  relinquish  operational  command  over 
its  combat  units — together  with  certain  formations  of  its  terri- 
torial army — in  the  event  of  war,  there  is  little  requirement  for 
independent  German  war  plans. 

In  passing  the  annual  budget  law,  the  Bundestag  determines 
the  number  of  military  and  civil  personnel  to  be  employed  in 
the  defense  sector,  sets  out  the  basic  features  of  the  Bundes- 
wehr  organization,  and  authorizes  the  financing  of  specific 
sums  for  defense.  Parliament  also  decides  other  important 
aspects  of  defense  policy,  such  as  the  duration  of  conscription. 
Before  forces  can  be  committed  to  military  action,  parliament 
must  determine  in  accordance  with  Article  80a  of  the  Basic 
Law  that  a  state  of  tension  exists  or  in  accordance  with  Article 
115a  that  a  state  of  defense  exists.  If  parliament  cannot  be  con- 
vened on  time,  the  twenty-two-member  Joint  Committee,  with 
the  president  of  the  Bundestag  presiding,  acts  on  its  behalf. 

Many  Bundestag  committees  also  exercise  some  controlling 
functions  over  the  Bundeswehr.  The  twenty-seven-member 
Defense  Committee  focuses  on  defense  and  security  policy  but 
can  also  function  as  an  investigating  committee. 

Army 

In  early  1995,  the  army  (Bundesheer),  headquartered  in 
Koblenz,  had  a  personnel  strength  of  appropriately  255,000, 
including  123,000  conscripts.  It  was  composed  of  two  principal 
elements,  the  field  army  and  the  much  smaller  territorial  army. 
Territorial  army  units  were  slated  to  be  merged  with  the  field 
army  by  the  end  of  1995.  The  field  army  is  listed  in  The  Military 
Balance,  1994-1995  as  consisting  of  three  corps  and  eight  divi- 
sions (four  armored  divisions,  three  armored  infantry  divi- 
sions, and  one  mountain  division). 

A  radical  reshaping  of  the  army  was  completed  by  the  end  of 
1994,  in  which  the  Bundeswehr  was  adapted  to  the  diminishing 
threat  in  Central  Europe,  the  recasting  of  NATO's  force  struc- 
ture, and  Germany's  1990  commitments  to  reduce  its  force 
level  and  armaments.  These  commitments  were  embodied  in 
the  Treaty  on  the  Final  Settlement  with  Respect  to  Germany, 
or,  as  it  is  more  commonly  known,  the  Two-Plus-Four  Treaty 
signed  in  September  1990  and  the  CFE  Treaty  signed  that 
November.  According  to  these  commitments,  manpower  had 
to  be  reduced  so  that  all  services  could  meet  the  CFE  ceiling  of 
370,000  by  December  1994,  with  a  sublimit  of  345,000  for  the 
army  and  air  force.  Naval  forces  also  had  to  be  cut,  although 


472 


National  Security 


they  were  not  included  in  the  CFE  Treaty  except  for  land-based 
marines  (of  which  Germany  has  none)  and  naval  air  units. 

The  treaty  obligations  were  met  successfully,  and  in  early 
1995  the  Bundesheer  amounted  to  about  255,000  soldiers,  of 
whom  about  123,000  were  conscripts.  The  army  consists  of 
three  corps,  under  the  overall  direction  of  the  Army  Forces 
Command.  The  headquarters  of  I  Corps  is  in  Munster,  that  of 
II  Corps  in  Ulm,  and  that  of  IV  Corps  in  Potsdam.  Only  IV 
Corps  is  solely  German.  The  other  two  are  joint  corps:  I  Corps 
is  German-Dutch;  II  Corps  is  German-United  States.  Under  the 
corps  commands  are  seven  divisions  in  place  of  the  previous 
twelve,  and  twenty-four  combat  brigades  instead  of  the  previous 
forty-eight.  Six  of  the  divisions  are  committed  to  NATO's  main 
defense  force,  but  the  two  divisions  of  IV  Corps  in  the  east 
remain  under  German  national  command.  Under  the  opera- 
tional command  of  II  Corps  is  the  Eurocorps,  scheduled  to  be 
operational  in  late  1995  with  50,000  troops.  Lastly,  there  is  the 
Air-Mobile  Forces  Command,  which  commands  crisis-reaction 
forces. 

The  army's  twenty-four  combat  brigades  include  sixteen 
mechanized  brigades,  three  airborne  brigades,  one  mountain 
brigade,  and  the  German  component  of  the  Franco-German 
Brigade.  Only  six  brigades  are  maintained  at  full  strength — two 
airborne  brigades,  three  mechanized  brigades,  and  the  moun- 
tain brigade.  Some  of  these  ready  brigades  are  committed  to 
the  NATO  Rapid  Reaction  Force.  All  of  the  active  units  are 
staffed  with  a  high  proportion  of  regulars.  The  remaining  bri- 
gades are  staffed  at  about  a  60  percent  level  in  peacetime, 
mainly  with  conscripts.  In  each  brigade,  one  armored  battalion 
and  one  infantry  battalion  are  filled  out  by  drawing  cadres 
from  staffed  units  when  expanded  to  full  strength.  Tanks  and 
other  armored  vehicles  of  the  cadre  units  are  stored,  as  are  25 
percent  of  the  vehicles  of  active  battalions. 

According  to  Ministry  of  Defense  plans,  the  Bundesheer  will 
become  even  smaller  in  the  second  half  of  the  1990s.  By  the 
year  2000,  the  army  is  to  consist  of  about  233,000  personnel,  of 
which  37,000  will  be  assigned  to  rapid-reaction  units.  The  army 
will  eliminate  one  division  headquarters  and  two  brigade  head- 
quarters. To  meet  NATO  obligations,  the  14th  Division  head- 
quarters in  Neubrandenburg  will  assume  the  mission  of  the  6th 
Division,  which  is  to  be  disbanded.  This  move  will  integrate  a 
division  in  the  new  Lander  into  the  NATO  military  structure  for 
the  first  time.

they  were  not  included  in  the  CFE  Treaty  except  for  land-based

The  treaty  obligations  were  met  successfully,  and  in  early 
1995  the  Bundesheer  amounted  to  about  255,000  soldiers,  of 
whom  about  123,000  were  conscripts.  The  army  consists  of

Corps  is  solely  German.  The  other  two  are  joint  corps:  I  Corps 
is  German-Dutch;  II  Corps  is  German-United  States.  Under  the 
corps  commands  are  seven  divisions  in  place  of  the  previous 
twelve,  and  twenty-four  combat  brigades  instead  of  the  previous

remain  under  German  national  command.  Under  the  opera- 
tional command  of  II  Corps  is  the  Eurocorps,  scheduled  to  be 
operational  in  late  1995  with  50,000  troops.  Lastly,  there  is  the 
Air-Mobile  Forces  Command,  which  commands  crisis-reaction 
forces. 

The  army's  twenty-four  combat  brigades  include  sixteen 
mechanized  brigades,  three  airborne  brigades,  one  mountain

Germany:  A  Country  Study 
Equipment 

With  the  absorption  of  equipment  from  the  NVA  in  1990, 
the  Bundesheer  had  more  than  7,000  main  battle  tanks,  most 
of  them  highly  regarded  German-built  Leopards  plus  nearly 
2,300  Soviet  models.  It  had  3,250  armored  infantry  fighting 
vehicles,  of  which  about  two-thirds  were  German  Marder  Al/ 
A2  models  and  the  remainder  Soviet  BMPs.  The  Bundesheer's 
inventory  listed  11,000  armored  personnel  carriers,  including 
a  large  number  of  Soviet  vehicles  inherited  from  the  NVA. 

As  of  1995,  Germany  had  kept  little  of  the  weaponry  of  the 
former  NVA,  giving  away  many  spare  parts,  destroying  huge 
caches  of  weapons  and  ammunition,  and  selling  surplus  equip- 
ment. East  German  tanks  had  been  shipped  to  Finland,  and 
warships  had  been  sold  to  Paraguay  and  Indonesia. 

In  line  with  its  GFE  commitments,  Germany  reduced  its 
inventory  of  main  battle  tanks  to  2,855,  its  armored  infantry 
fighting  vehicles  to  2,443  units,  and  its  artillery  to  2,090  pieces 
(see  table  23,  Appendix).  This  represented  the  highest  rate  of 
disarmament  among  the  CFE  signatories,  with  the  exception  of 
Russia. 

In  accordance  with  several  international  commitments,  no 
nuclear,  biological,  or  chemical  weapons  are  in  the  German 
arms  inventory.  Under  the  Two-Plus-Four  Treaty,  Germany 
reaffirmed  its  renunciation  of  the  manufacture,  possession, 
and  control  of  such  weapons.  A  number  of  German  weapons 
systems  are  nuclear-capable,  but  nuclear  warheads  and  bombs 
remain  under  the  control  of  the  United  States.  Some  Tornado 
aircraft  have  been  fitted  to  accept  nuclear  bombs. 

Franco-German  Brigade  and  Eurocorps 

In  1987  German  chancellor  Helmut  Kohl  and  French  presi- 
dent Francois  Mitterrand  agreed  on  the  formation  of  a  Franco- 
German  Brigade  to  be  stationed  in  southwest  Germany,  but 
with  headquarters  in  Strasbourg,  France.  Once  established,  the 
French  and  German  units  in  the  brigade  were  not  integrated; 
the  brigade  functioned  jointly  only  at  the  command,  secretar- 
iat, and  logistic  levels.  The  German  contribution  consisted  of 
one  mechanized  infantry  battalion,  one  artillery  battalion,  and 
one  self-propelled  antitank  company.  Troops  are  attired  in  the 
uniforms  of  their  own  armies  but  wear  a  distinctive  blue  beret 
bearing  the  insignia  of  both  armies. 

In  May  1992,  Kohl  and  Mitterrand  announced  the  establish- 
ment of  a  Eurocorps  intended  to  form  the  nucleus  of  a  Euro- 


476 


National  Security 


pean  army.  All  the  states  of  the  Western  European  Union 
(WEU — see  Glossary)  were  invited  to  participate.  Three  possi- 
ble missions  were  identified:  deployment  under  NATO  control 
in  time  of  war;  peacemaking  and  peacekeeping  operations 
under  WEU  command  in  places  outside  the  NATO  treaty  area, 
subject  to  constitutional  limits  on  German  troop  deployments; 
and  employment  for  humanitarian  purposes  abroad. 

The  Eurocorps  is  scheduled  to  be  operational  by  October 
1995  and  to  number  about  50,000  troops,  including  a  French 
armored  division,  a  German  division,  a  Belgian  mechanized 
division,  and  a  Spanish  mechanized  infantry  brigade.  The  Ger- 
man division,  the  10th  Armored,  will  remain  simultaneously 
committed  to  NATO.  The  troops  will  be  stationed  on  German 
soil  and  will  retain  their  separate  national  identities  under  a 
joint  command  at  Strasbourg.  Before  the  Eurocorps  can  be 
deployed,  every  government  that  has  contributed  troops  will 
have  to  approve  the  mission. 

Navy 

The  primary  areas  of  operation  of  the  navy  (Bundesmarine) 
in  the  event  of  war  are  the  Baltic  Sea  and  the  North  Sea.  Until 
1990  the  navy's  mission  had  been  to  block  the  Baltic 
approaches  on  behalf  of  NATO  to  prevent  the  deployment  of 
the  Soviet  Baltic  Fleet  in  the  North  Sea  and  the  Atlantic  Ocean. 
The  navy  also  contributed  to  protection  of  NATO  sea  routes  by 
helping  to  control  the  North  Sea  and  the  Norwegian  Sea. 
Although  lacking  large  surface  units,  the  navy  was  well 
equipped  to  carry  out  intelligence  and  reconnaissance,  mine 
countermeasure  operations,  and  antisubmarine  and  antiship 
warfare.  The  navy  regularly  participated  in  NATO  exercises  as 
part  of  the  Standing  Naval  Force  Atlantic  and  Standing  Naval 
Force  Channel. 

The  political  changes  that  unfolded  in  1990  enabled  the 
navy  to  reduce  its  concentration  on  the  Baltic  Sea  and  north- 
ern flank,  shifting  from  defending  against  a  tangible  Warsaw 
Pact  threat  to  preparing  for  a  broader  spectrum  of  maritime 
defense  missions  and  tasks  beyond  home  waters.  The  deploy- 
ment of  mine  countermeasure  vessels  to  the  Mediterranean  for 
NATO  during  the  Persian  Gulf  crisis  in  1990  and  to  the  Persian 
Gulf  after  hostilities  broke  out  in  1991,  as  well  as  Germany's 
participation  in  monitoring  the  naval  blockade  against  Serbia 
in  1992,  undoubtedly  foreshadow  other  possible  requirements 
distant  from  German  coastal  waters.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Although  the  navy  is  preparing  for  possible  involvement  in 
future  multilateral  and  humanitarian  missions,  its  primary  task 
will  continue  to  be  to  prevent  attacking  forces  from  controlling 
German  territorial  and  adjacent  waters.  The  nations  of  the 
former  Soviet  Union  are  no  longer  regarded  as  hostile;  how- 
ever, the  presence  of  Russian  naval  units  in  the  Baltic,  with 
their  potential  to  deny  Germany  the  use  of  its  territorial  waters 
and  the  high  seas,  remains  a  relevant  factor  in  strategic  plan- 
ning. 

As  of  early  1995,  the  navy  had  about  30,000  personnel, 
including  4,230  Naval  Air  Arm  personnel,  and  6,700  conscripts. 
The  ship  inventory  included  as  its  principal  combat  units 
twenty  submarines,  thirteen  destroyers  and  frigates,  and  thirty- 
eight  missile  craft  (see  table  24,  Appendix).  The  Naval  Air  Arm 
is  equipped  with  Tornado  fighter-ground  attack  aircraft  and 
Breguet  Atlantic  aircraft  fitted  for  long-range  reconnaissance, 
including  some  dedicated  to  electronic  intelligence.  Dornier 
Do-28s  are  used  for  short-range  surveillance  and  patrol  of  the 
Exclusive  Economic  Zone.  Two  Westland  Sea  Lynx  helicopters 
are  based  on  each  frigate  for  antisubmarine  warfare  and  target 
acquisition. 

Four  Brandenburg-class  frigates  are  under  construction  to 
replace  Hamburg-class  vessels  by  the  end  of  1996.  Four  Type 
212  submarines  are  scheduled  to  be  introduced  after  2000  to 
begin  the  replacement  of  Type  205  and  unmodernized  Type 
206  submarines. 

At  unification  the  East  German  navy  had  a  substantial  fleet 
of  twenty-three  frigates,  fifty-two  missile  boats,  and  twenty-four 
mine  warfare  vessels.  Because  the  West  German  navy  was 
already  facing  a  sharp  reduction,  all  East  German  ships  were 
scheduled  to  be  scrapped  or  sold,  rather  than  absorbed  within 
the  unified  navy. 

Proportionately,  the  cuts  imposed  on  the  navy  in  response  to 
the  improved  security  situation  in  Europe  have  been  the  great- 
est among  the  three  services.  The  ship  inventory  will  be 
reduced  to  nearly  half  by  the  year  2005.  The  future  German 
fleet  will  consist  of  about  ninety  vessels,  including  fifteen  frig- 
ates, eight  submarines,  fifteen  corvette  patrol  vessels,  and 
twenty  mine  countermeasure  ships.  Personnel  strength  will 
decline  to  about  27,000  by  2000. 

Under  the  chief  of  staff  of  the  navy  are  three  major  com- 
mands: the  Fleet  Command  at  Glucksburg  on  the  Baltic  Sea; 
the  Naval  Office  at  Rostock,  responsible  for  enlisted  personnel,

schools,  armament,  and  the  medical  service;  and  the  Naval 
Logistics  Command  at  Wilhelmshaven.  Under  the  consolida- 
tion plans,  a  number  of  bases  will  be  closed  and  headquarters 
merged,  leaving  four  main  bases:  Wilhelmshaven  (frigates  plus 
support  vessels);  Kiel  (frigates,  submarines,  and  support  ves- 
sels); Olpenitz  (mine  countermeasure  vessels);  and 
Warnemunde  (patrol  boats).  The  naval  air  combat  arm  will  be 
reduced  from  four  to  three  wings  of  about  forty-six  Tornados 
based  at  Eggebek  (near  the  Danish  border),  mainly  for  recon- 
naissance and  attack  sorties.  The  naval  air  station  at  Jagel  and 
the  remaining  Tornados  will  be  assigned  to  the  air  force. 

Air  Force 

The  air  force  (Luftwaffe)  has  faced  dramatic  changes  in 
structure  and  strategic  concepts  as  a  result  of  the  diminished 
threat  in  Central  Europe  and  shrinking  budgetary  resources 
for  modernized  weapons  systems.  Prior  to  the  demise  of  the 
Warsaw  Pact,  the  air  force  had  as  its  primary  mission  the  air 
defense  of  Central  Europe  in  conjunction  with  other  NATO  air 
forces.  This  included  reconnaissance  to  forestall  surprise 
attack,  interdiction  of  enemy  ground  and  air  forces,  prevention 
of  enemy  aircraft  from  reaching  strategic  targets,  protection  of 
friendly  forces  against  air  attack,  and  close  battlefield  support 
for  NATO  ground  troops.  The  new  security  environment  in 
Europe  has  brought  a  change  in  tasks  for  the  Luftwaffe.  With 
the  absorption  of  the  former  East  Germany,  the  national  air- 
space that  had  to  be  patrolled  increased  substantially  With  a 
major  confrontation  in  Central  Europe  now  only  a  slight  possi- 
bility, the  Luftwaffe  has  had  to  adjust  its  missions  to  take 
account  of  the  possibility  of  involvement  in  conflict  beyond  the 
borders  of  Europe  and  in  unstable  regions  within  Europe. 

As  of  early  1995,  the  Luftwaffe  had  a  personnel  strength  of 
83,000,  including  25,000  conscripts.  The  principal  combat 
units  were  eight  squadrons  of  fighter-ground  attack  aircraft, 
equipped  with  Tornado  fighter-ground  attack  aircraft.  There 
were  seven  fighter  squadrons,  six  with  F-4Fs  and  one  with 
MiG-29s  (see  table  25,  Appendix).  Developed  as  a  joint  effort 
by  Britain,  Italy,  and  West  Germany,  the  Tornado  is  a  high- 
speed, low-altitude,  all-weather  attack  aircraft.  The  McDonnell 
Douglas  F-4F  Phantom,  introduced  in  the  United  States  in  the 
1960s,  is  still  regarded  as  an  outstanding  fighter  and  attack  air- 
craft of  exceptional  versatility  However,  it  is  scheduled  to  be

replaced  by  a  new  combat  aircraft  in  the  late  1990s,  the  Euro- 
pean Fighter  Aircraft  (EFA). 

Ground-based  air  defense  consisted  of  six  groups,  each  with 
six  squadrons,  equipped  with  Patriot  surface-to-air  missile 
(SAM)  launchers;  six  groups,  each  with  six  squadrons, 
equipped  with  Hawk  launchers;  and  fourteen  squadrons 
equipped  with  Roland  launchers  for  point  defense.  The  Ger- 
man air  defense  units  covering  Central  Europe  and  the  Baltic 
approaches  were  fully  operational,  subject  to  control  by 
NATO's  integrated  air-defense  system  even  during  peacetime. 

By  1998  two  squadrons  of  Tornado  fighter-bombers  are 
scheduled  to  be  transferred  from  the  navy  to  the  air  force, 
along  with  800  naval  personnel,  as  part  of  the  plan  to  trans- 
form the  naval  air  base  at  Jagel  on  the  Baltic  Sea  into  a  Luft- 
waffe base.  Of  all  the  equipment  taken  over  from  the  East 
German  air  force,  only  one  squadron  of  MiG-29  fighter  air- 
craft was  absorbed  by  the  Luftwaffe. 

The  ranking  uniformed  member  of  the  Luftwaffe  is  the  air 
force  chief  of  staff,  with  headquarters  in  Cologne.  Also  at 
Cologne  is  the  Combat  Command,  subdivided  into  the  South- 
ern Tactical  Command  and  Northern  Tactical  Command.  The 
Southern  Tactical  Command  is  collocated  with  NATO  Com- 
bined Air  Operations  Center  at  Messstellen  in  the  southwest- 
ern corner  of  Germany;  the  Northern  Tactical  Command  is  at 
Kalkar  near  the  Dutch  border.  The  Transport  Command  at 
Munster  also  comes  under  the  Combat  Command,  as  does  the 
Communications  and  Electronic  Command.  The  Air  Force 
Office  in  Cologne  is  responsible  for  personnel,  training,  com- 
munications, and  armaments.  The  Air  Force  Logistics  Com- 
mand, also  in  Cologne,  is  responsible  for  logistic  units,  training 
installations,  and  materiel. 

Training 

The  basic  objective  of  Bundeswehr  training  is  to  impart  the 
technical  knowledge  necessary  for  mastery  of  advanced  weap- 
onry while  instilling  the  discipline  required  in  combat  situa- 
tions. Educational  opportunities  offered  to  service  personnel 
vary  with  the  length  of  enlistment  and  are  intended  to  produce 
combat  readiness  while,  to  the  extent  possible,  providing  skills 
that  will  ease  the  eventual  transition  to  civilian  life.  The 
Bundeswehr  operates  more  than  forty  schools  in  addition  to 
thirty-three  apprentice  workshops  and  ten  nursing  schools  at 
station  hospitals.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Basic  and  small-unit  training  are  scheduled  on  a  continuing 
basis.  For  conscripts,  the  entire  period  of  service  is  devoted  to 
one  kind  of  training  or  another,  but  conscripts  are  not  eligible 
for  attendance  at  advanced  service  schools  unless  they  volun- 
tarily extend  their  term  of  service.  After  an  introductory  assign- 
ment to  basic  training  regiments,  air  force  conscripts  prepare 
for  their  special  tasks  in  on-the-job  training.  Because  the  Luft- 
waffe wishes  to  attract  a  higher  proportion  of  longer-term  per- 
sonnel, it  offers  temporary  career  training  and  regular  officer 
advanced  training  at  air  force  extension  schools,  as  well  as  at 
training  facilities  of  the  other  services  and  other  Allied  forces. 
In  the  navy,  sailors  prepare' for  their  duties  at  schools  ashore 
before  being  assigned  to  ships  for  more  on-the-job  training. 
Volunteers  receive  advanced  training  at  various  schools  offer- 
ing courses  in  supply,  engineering,  radar,  weapons,  and  other 
specialties.  In  both  the  air  force  and  the  navy,  training  culmi- 
nates in  national  operational  exercises  and  large-scale  NATO 
exercises. 

About  2,000  pilots  and  missile  personnel  of  the  air  force  and 
navy  are  trained  in  the  United  States  under  long-standing 
agreements  between  the  German  and  United  States  govern- 
ments. Primary  pilot  training  is  conducted  at  Sheppard  Air 
Force  Base  in  Texas  on  Beech  Bonanzas,  followed  by  jet  train- 
ing on  T-37Bs  and  T-38As.  A  Tornado  squadron  is  based  at 
Holloman  Air  Force  Base  in  New  Mexico  for  advanced  weap- 
ons training.  German  personnel  attend  the  Patriot  and  Hawk 
missile  school  at  Fort  Bliss,  Texas,  and  navigator  training  at 
Randolph  Air  Force  Base  near  San  Antonio.  Helicopter  train- 
ing is  conducted  at  Fort  Rucker,  Alabama. 

Much  training  is  conducted  jointly  with  service  personnel  of 
other  NATO  countries.  Joint  courses  include  forward  air  con- 
troller training  at  Furstenfeldbruck  Air  Force  Base,  training  at 
the  army  engineer  school  in  Munich,  and  NATO  logistics 
courses  at  the  Bundeswehr  Logistics  School  in  Hamburg.  Ger- 
man and  other  NATO  pilots  train  in  low-level  flight  techniques 
in  Canada  at  Goose  Bay,  Labrador.  German  troops  are  shuttled 
to  the  Canadian  province  of  Manitoba  for  armored  infantry 
training  on  German  equipment  permanently  maintained 
there. 

The  basic  qualification  for  voluntary  enlistment  in  the 
Bundeswehr  is  completion  of  five  years  at  the  secondary  school 
(Hauptschule)  level  (see  The  Education  System,  ch.  4).  Those 
with  a  university  or  technical  college  admission  certificate  can 


482 


483 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

apply  to  become  temporary  career  or  regular  officer  candi- 
dates. Junior  NCO  training  lasts  about  fifteen  months  and 
stresses  leadership  qualities  and  practical  skills.  An  opportunity 
for  further  training  leading  to  senior  NCO  rank  usually  comes 
after  about  four  years  of  service.  Particularly  qualified  NCOs 
are  admitted  to  a  three-year  course  whose  graduates  are  com- 
missioned as  officer  specialists  with  the  rank  of  lieutenant  or 
captain.  Officer  specialists  fill  positions  corresponding  to  those 
occupied  by  warrant  officers  in  the  United  States  military. 

Officer  candidates  in  the  army,  navy,  and  air  force  face  a 
long,  arduous  training  program.  Those  aspiring  to  be  regular 
officers,  as  well  as  temporary  career  officers  who  serve  up  to 
twelve  years  on  active  duty,  generally  spend  about  five  years  in 
formal  training  programs.  Officer  candidates  generally  begin 
their  career  with  nine  months  of  basic  training  and  specialized 
weapons  training  followed  by  twelve  months  at  an  officer  candi- 
date school — the  army  school  in  Hanover,  the  air  force  school 
in  Furstenfeldbruck,  or  the  naval  academy  at  Murwik  in  Flens- 
burg. 

After  a  year  or  more  as  a  small-unit  leader,  officers  with  at 
least  a  twelve-year  enlistment  begin  a  three-year  course  of  study 
at  the  Bundeswehr's  military  academy  in  Hamburg  or  the  mili- 
tary academy  in  Munich  that  leads  to  an  academic  degree  or 
technical  diploma.  Most  officers  leave  the  service  between  the 
ages  of  thirty  and  thirty-two  after  serving  as  company  com- 
manders or  the  equivalent.  A  smaller  number  of  senior  cap- 
tains or  navy  lieutenants  qualify  for  attendance  at  the  four- 
month  staff  officer  course  at  the  Federal  Armed  Forces  Com- 
mand and  General  Staff  College  in  Hamburg. 

Those  officers  with  outstanding  grades  in  the  staff  officer 
course  and  a  generally  excellent  record — about  10  percent  of 
the  officers  completing  the  course — are  selected  to  undergo 
the  twenty-four-month  general  and  admiral  staff  training  pro- 
gram, also  offered  at  Hamburg.  The  remaining  90  percent 
attend  an  eight-week  staff  officer  course  in  various  specialties 
such  as  operations,  logistics,  personnel,  and  transportation. 
Promotion  to  the  rank  of  major  follows  completion  of  the 
course.  Field-grade  officers  not  selected  for  general  staff  train- 
ing usually  retire  as  lieutenant  colonels;  general  staff  officers 
can  expect  to  be  promoted  to  colonel  or  naval  captain.  About 
80  percent  of  the  officers  who  reach  the  rank  of  general  or 
admiral  have  been  selected  from  the  general  staff  group.

National  Security 


Reserves 

Under  the  revised  military  structure  introduced  in  1992,  the 
Bundeswehr  will  become  increasingly  dependent  on  the  rapid 
mobilization  of  reserves  to  bring  both  the  main  combat  bri- 
gades and  the  support  units  up  to  authorized  strengths  in  an 
emergency.  In  early  1995,  the  reserves  of  former  service  mem- 
bers (enlisted  to  age  forty-five;  officers  and  NCOs  to  age  sixty) 
numbered  about  441,900,  of  whom  358,000  would  report  to 
the  army,  10,900  to  the  navy,  and  73,000  to  the  air  force.  Some 
50  percent  of  the  army's  main  weapons  systems  depend  for 
their  operation  on  staffing  by  reservists. 

After  discharge,  former  soldiers  are  liable  for  reserve  service 
until  age  forty-five,  or  until  age  sixty  in  time  of  war.  Officers 
and  NCOs  are  subject  to  recall  until  age  sixty.  Reservists  can  be 
called  up  for  one  fifteen-day  period  of  training  a  year  and  for 
any  number  of  call-ups  of  up  to  three  days  in  emergencies.  The 
average  reserve  unit  assembles  once  every  two  years.  Reservists 
with  crucial  skills  tend  to  be  called  up  more  frequently;  less- 
skilled  reservists  or  those  in  less  vital  units  may  not  be  called  up 
at  all.  The  number  of  call-ups  is  determined  in  the  annual 
defense  budget  in  terms  of  reserve  slots,  each  slot  equivalent  to 
365  duty  days.  A  total  of  4,000  reserve  slots  were  authorized  in 
1993,  which  permitted  about  100,000  individual  call-ups.  By 
contrast,  35,000  slots  were  authorized  per  year  during  the  early 
1980s. 

Morale 

The  deep  reductions  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  in  the  size 
of  the  active  Bundeswehr  and  the  accompanying  deactivation 
and  consolidation  of  units,  together  with  base  closings  and  per- 
sonnel transfers,  have  placed  serious  strains  on  the  morale  of 
the  armed  forces.  Previously,  an  NCO  could  expect  to  pass 
almost  his  entire  career  at  a  single  post,  usually  in  or  near  his 
hometown.  In  the  restructured  army,  many  senior  NCOs  have 
been  reassigned  to  distant  parts  of  Germany;  serious  disrup- 
tions of  family  often  have  been  the  result.  Garrison  housing  is 
likely  to  be  unavailable,  and  affordable  housing  may  be  diffi- 
cult to  find  off  post.  In  many  cases,  wives  must  give  up  jobs  that 
provide  a  much-needed  second  income.  Frequently,  NCOs  pre- 
fer to  commute  long  distances  to  their  new  posts  or  simply  to 
live  apart  from  their  families.  Assignment  to  eastern  Germany, 


485 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

where  there  is  a  strong  need  for  NCO  cadres,  can  be  especially 
burdensome  because  of  poor  living  conditions  there. 

The  decline  in  popular  support  for  the  Bundeswehr  further 
undermines  the  morale  of  service  personnel.  According  to  a 
poll  taken  in  mid-1992,  only  47  percent  of  Germans  were  con- 
vinced that  the  country  needed  armed  forces,  down  from  75 
percent  in  1984.  A  similar  spirit  has  pervaded  the  ranks  of  con- 
scripts and  young  soldiers  who  accept  military  training  rather 
than  the  alternative  of  civilian  service.  Pacifist  and  church 
organizations  have  counseled  young  Germans  on  seeking  con- 
scientious objector  status,  and  in  1991  the  number  of  conscien- 
tious objectors  was  roughly  equal  to  the  number  of  draftees.  A 
vocal  peace  movement  has  also  influenced  many  civilians  to 
reject  the  company  of  military  professionals.  Soldiers  often 
avoid  wearing  their  uniforms  in  public  to  escape  unfriendly 
comments  or  treatment. 

NCOs  complain  that  it  is  difficult  to  instill  discipline  and 
impose  a  strict  training  regimen  on  indifferent  conscripts  who, 
in  the  changed  international  atmosphere,  never  expect  to  be 
faced  with  an  actual  military  contingency.  Conscripts  expend 
minimal  effort  during  their  months  of  military  training,  living 
mainly  for  weekends  with  their  families.  Conscripts  generally 
are  garrisoned  close  to  home;  some  can  even  commute  on  a 
daily  basis,  treating  military  service  as  little  different  from  a  fac- 
tory or  office  job.  Conscripts  are  entitled  to  free  time  to  com- 
pensate for  exercises  conducted  beyond  regular  duty  hours, 
although  this  entitlement  will  end  in  1996. 

Some  professional  soldiers,  skeptical  that  twelve  months  of 
service  (scheduled  to  be  ten  months  in  1996)  can  produce 
combat-ready  soldiers  and  fearing  that  political  pressures  could 
lead  to  an  even  shorter  period  of  service,  advocate  abandoning 
the  universal  military  system.  One  reason  for  retaining  univer- 
sal military  service  is  the  belief  that  it  helps  prevent  the  military 
from  again  becoming  a  distinct  caste  with  few  roots  in  demo- 
cratic civilian  society.  Officers  hoping  to  induce  promising  con- 
scripts  to  volunteer  for  longer  enlistment  also  view 
conscription  favorably. 

The  pride  the  Bundeswehr  takes  in  the  high  standards  of  its 
personnel  and  the  quality  of  its  training  and  weaponry  was 
blunted  by  the  absence  of  German  contingents  from  the  inter- 
national forces  assembled  to  defeat  Iraq  in  1991.  The  constitu- 
tional limitation  on  German  troop  deployments  outside  the 
NATO  area  has  been  a  blow  to  the  prestige  of  the  career  mili- 


486

tary  men,  many  of  whom  feel  that  they  are  regarded  as  shirkers 
by  their  NATO  partners.  The  July  1994  decision  of  the  Federal 
Constitutional  Court  to  permit  out-of-area  deployment  when 
approved  by  the  Bundestag  will  reduce  the  likelihood  of  such 
situations  occurring  again. 

Integration  of  East  German  Armed  Forces 

Established  in  1956,  the  National  People's  Army  (Nationale 
Volksarmee — NVA)  of  the  German  Democratic  Republic  was 
considered  one  of  the  most  formidable  elements  of  the  Warsaw 
Pact's  armed  might.  It  comprised  about  170,000  personnel  in 
all  three  services,  which  could  quickly  be  expanded  to  a  mobili- 
zation strength  of  350,000.  NVA  land  forces  consisted  of  six 
standing  divisions  and  five  reserve  divisions.  The  army  was 
equipped  with  some  of  the  Warsaw  Pact's  most  modern  weap- 
ons, as  well  as  enormous  stockpiles  of  ammunition.  The  NVA's 
structure  and  training  followed  Soviet  lines.  Detailed  war  plans 
called  for  the  NVA  to  combine  with  other  Warsaw  Pact  forces  in 
a  powerful  and  sudden  assault  against  NATO's  central  region 
to  overrun  Western  Europe  in  blitzkrieg  fashion.  The  offensive 
use  of  tactical  nuclear  weapons  was  assumed. 

Although  the  NVA's  weapons  and  vehicles  were  maintained 
at  a  high  level  of  operational  readiness,  signs  of  deterioration 
and  personnel  preparedness  in  manpower  were  evident  even 
before  the  opening  of  the  Berlin  Wall  in  November  1989.  Once 
the  Wall  opened,  many  reservists  and  some  conscripts  fled  the 
country,  disappearing  into  West  Germany.  Authority  and 
morale  declined  as  ordinary  soldiers  rebelled  against  strict  dis- 
cipline and  military  exercises.  When  soldiers'  councils  sprang 
up,  NVA  commanders  bowed  to  pressure  to  allow  soldiers  to 
wear  civilian  clothes  off  post  and  enjoy  relaxed  discipline, 
reduced  training  time,  and  an  end  to  political  indoctrination. 
The  morale  of  officers  facing  the  loss  of  careers  and  status 
began  to  waver  as  the  internal  situation  worsened  and  the  pros- 
pect of  unification  grew. 

Until  mid-1990  the  leadership  of  the  NVA  still  hoped  that 
the  force  might  survive  as  a  distinct  entity  in  a  reconstituted 
German  state.  As  a  result  of  the  summit  agreement  between 
West  German  chancellor  Helmut  Kohl  and  Soviet  president 
Mikhail  Gorbachev  in  July  1990,  however,  the  Soviet  Union 
withdrew  its  objections  to  a  united  Germany's  membership  in 
NATO.  The  NVA  was  disbanded  upon  unification,  and  its  facili- 
ties and  resources  were  taken  over  by  the  Bundeswehr. 


487 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

On  October  3,  1990,  the  date  of  unification,  control  over  all 
NVA  commands  and  border  troops  passed  to  the  newly  created 
Bundeswehr  Eastern  Command.  The  command's  function  was 
to  deactivate  unneeded  units,  to  dispose  of  surplus  materiel 
and  weapons,  and  to  extend  support  to  the  withdrawing  Soviet 
forces.  The  command  was  terminated  after  nine  months,  and 
the  various  elements  of  the  former  NVA  were  transferred  to  the 
three  chiefs  of  staff  and  the  medical  service  corps  of  the 
Bundeswehr. 

The  90,000  NVA  service  personnel  and  47,000  civilian 
employees  who  remained  were  merged  into  the  Bundeswehr 
on  a  preliminary  basis.  It  was  decided  that  up  to  50,000  of  the 
former  NVA  troops  would  be  retained  as  part  of  the 
Bundeswehr.  Of  14,600  NVA  officers,  5,100  were  permitted  to 
enter  the  Bundeswehr  for  a  transition  period  of  two  years. 
Some  70  percent  of  these — mostly  junior  officers — would  be 
retained  after  approval  for  regular  Bundeswehr  service  and 
screening  to  eliminate  former  members  of  East  Germany's 
State  Security  Service  (Staatssicherheitsdienst — Stasi) .  Many  of 
the  25,000  NVA  enlisted  personnel  were  assigned  to  a  three- 
month  basic  training  course  with  West  German  units.  The 
dilapidated  condition  of  NVA  barracks,  mess  halls,  and  other 
facilities  necessitated  large  expenditures  to  bring  them  up  to 
minimal  Bundeswehr  standards. 

All  190  NVA  general  officers  were  retired,  as  were  all  colo- 
nels and  many  other  officers  over  age  fifty-five.  Most  of  those 
retained  were  no  older  than  thirty-five.  Many  former  NVA  offi- 
cers were  demoted  by  one  or  two  ranks  if  they  were  younger 
than  officers  of  corresponding  ranks  in  the  Bundeswehr. 
Although  East  German  troops  had  been  paid  at  a  lower  scale 
than  their  West  German  counterparts,  parity  was  achieved  by 
1994.  Junior  NVA  officers,  unused  to  exercising  initiative,  had 
to  be  trained  in  a  new  doctrine  of  command. 

A  major  effort  was  needed  to  instill  democratic  principles  of 
leadership  and  a  new  perspective  on  historical  and  political 
questions.  NVA  officers  had  been  indoctrinated  with  commu- 
nist beliefs  and  had  been  considered  among  the  most  politi- 
cally reliable  elements  of  the  East  German  state.  Although 
forced  to  acknowledge  that  Marxist  theories  had  diverged  from 
social  and  economic  realities  in  East  Germany,  many  still 
tended  to  view  communism  as  a  valid,  if  Utopian,  political  phi- 
losophy.

National  Security 


After  absorption  of  the  East  German  armed  forces,  the  six 
active  NVA  divisions  were  converted  to  brigades,  with  three  bri- 
gades in  each  of  two  divisions.  One  division  was  headquartered 
at  Neubrandenburg  and  the  other  at  Leipzig.  Both  divisions 
became  part  of  IV  Corps,  which  has  its  headquarters  at  Pots- 
dam. 

During  a  transition  period,  the  brigades  operated  Soviet 
BMP  armored  vehicles,  but  Soviet  tanks  were  replaced  by  Leo- 
pards. In  the  air  force,  the  division  at  Eggerdorf  controlled  two 
fighter  wings  of  Phantom  F-4Fs  and  Soviet  MiG-29s,  with  the 
Soviet  aircraft  to  be  gradually  reduced  in  number.  The  former 
East  German  naval  base  at  Warnemunde  on  the  Baltic  Sea  was 
developed  as  the  home  port  for  fast-attack  missile  craft. 

Large  quantities  of  East  German  weapons  were  turned  over 
to  the  Bundeswehr,  including  2,300  main  battle  tanks,  7,800 
armored  vehicles,  2,500  artillery  pieces,  400  combat  aircraft, 
fifty  attack  helicopters,  and  many  missile  and  rocket  systems. 
More  than  300,000  tons  of  ammunition  had  been  stockpiled. 
With  exceptions  that  included  MiG-29s,  BMP  infantry  fighting 
vehicles,  and  some  transport  helicopters,  the  Bundeswehr 
decided  against  trying  to  integrate  former  NVA  weapons  into 
its  inventory.  Ceilings  imposed  by  the  CFE  Treaty,  as  well  as 
problems  of  convertibility  and  safety,  ruled  out  the  wholesale 
absorption  of  the  weapons.  After  first  being  concentrated  in 
special  depots,  massive  stocks  of  equipment  and  munitions, 
except  for  a  few  items  transferred  to  other  countries,  were 
slated  for  destruction — a  task  of  unprecedented  magnitude. 

Defense  Budget 

From  about  1960  until  1990,  the  West  German  defense  bud- 
get rose  at  a  remarkably  steady  rate,  just  under  3  percent  a  year 
in  real  terms.  If  NATO  definitions  of  defense  expenditures  are 
applied,  outlays  remained  constant  during  the  1980s  before  ris- 
ing about  4.7  percent  in  real  terms  in  1990  and  then  declining 
by  6.8  percent  in  1991.  At  the  same  time,  defense  spending  as  a 
ratio  of  the  overall  federal  budget  decreased  from  11.2  percent 
in  1979  to  9.5  percent  in  1989.  Outlays  for  defense  also  tended 
to  decline  as  a  proportion  of  the  gross  national  product 
(GNP — see  Glossary),  from  3.3  percent  in  1979  to  2.8  percent 
in  1989. 

The  Bundeswehr  frequently  experienced  difficulty  securing 
adequate  funds  to  maintain  personnel  and  equipment  at 
desired  levels  because  of  the  disinclination  of  the  post-World

War  II  generation  to  earmark  resources  for  the  buildup  of  the 
military  establishment.  The  absence  of  any  palpable  threat 
after  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  bloc,  combined  with  the  unex- 
pectedly high  costs  of  integrating  eastern  Germany  into  the 
Federal  Republic,  generated  even  stronger  pressures  to  make 
deep  cuts  in  defense  spending. 

From  a  high  of  DM57.5  billion  (US$35.6  billion)  in  1990, 
the  defense  budget  was  scaled  back  to  about  DM52.0  billion 
(US$34  billion)  in  both  1991  and  1992,  to  DM49.6  billion 
(US$31.8  billion)  in  1993,  and  to  DM47.2  billion  (US$28.6  bil- 
lion) in  1994.  According  to  Ministry  of  Defense  plans,  the 
annual  defense  budget  should  level  off  at  about  DM48  billion 
(US$32  billion)  through  the  year  2006. 

Announced  cuts  in  the  procurement  budget  are  expected  to 
produce  savings  of  more  than  DM72  billion  in  the  period 
between  1992  and  2006.  Replacement  of  the  Leopard  2  main 
battle  tank  was  canceled,  and  the  number  of  Leopard  2s  to  be 
upgraded  was  reduced.  A  replacement  for  the  Jaguar  antitank 
vehicle  was  deleted,  and  fewer  Marder  infantry  fighting  vehi- 
cles and  self-propelled  howitzers  will  be  introduced.  Also,  a 
smaller  number  of  the  new  Franco-German  Tiger  PAH-2 
attack  helicopters  will  be  acquired  than  originally  planned.  To 
effect  additional  savings,  the  construction  schedule  for  new 
frigates  and  submarines  has  been  stretched  out. 

According  to  data  compiled  by  the  United  States  Arms  Con- 
trol and  Disarmament  Agency  (ACDA),  Germany's  military 
expenditures  per  capita  in  1993  (US$454)  were  above  the 
NATO  Europe  average  (US$416)  and  below  those  of  France 
(US$740)  or  Britain  (US$587).  United  States  expenditures  per 
capita  were  US$1,153  in  the  same  year.  Expressed  as  a  percent- 
age of  GNP,  military  expenditures  in  1993  (2.2  percent)  were 
lower  than  the  NATO  Europe  average  (2.7  percent).  The  1992 
share  of  military  spending  in  central  government  expenditures 
(6.3  percent)  was  also  below  the  NATO  1992  average  of  6.5  per- 
cent. 

Military  Justice 

Members  of  the  German  armed  forces  are  subject  to  the  civil 
criminal  code  and  are  tried  for  common  criminal  offenses  in 
the  civil  court  system.  There  are  no  military  correction  facili- 
ties; incarcerated  military  offenders  serve  their  sentences  in 
ordinary  civilian  prisons.  Soldiers  enjoy  the  same  civil  rights 
and  liberties  possessed  by  other  citizens.  They  are  permitted  to 


490 


National  Security 


take  an  active  part  in  political  life,  be  members  of  political  par- 
ties, and  join  trade  unions  and  professional  associations.  Sev- 
eral courses  of  action  are  open  to  soldiers  with  complaints  or 
grievances,  both  within  the  Bundeswehr  and  in  ordinary  courts 
of  law. 

Offenses  of  a  specifically  military  character  committed  by 
members  of  the  Bundeswehr  are  tried  in  two  military  court 
divisions  of  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  and  by  three  mili- 
tary disciplinary  courts  having  a  total  of  twenty-nine  chambers. 
A  civilian  professional  judge  presides  over  each  chamber, 
assisted  by  honorary  military  judges.  The  chambers  are  the 
courts  of  first  instance  for  disciplinary  court  proceedings 
against  soldiers.  The  military  courts  of  the  Federal  Administra- 
tive Court  are  the  courts  of  appeal,  each  being  composed  of 
three  civilian  judges  and  two  honorary  military  judges.  Sen- 
tences range  from  discharge  from  service  to  financial  penalties 
to  reduction  in  rank.  The  lowest  level  of  offense,  such  as  dis- 
obedience or  unauthorized  absence,  may  be  dealt  with  infor- 
mally in  a  soldier's  own  unit. 

Uniforms,  Ranks,  and  Insignia 

The  service  uniform  is  the  most  common  type  of 
Bundeswehr  uniform  for  general  duty  and  most  off-post  activ- 
ity. The  army's  service  uniform  consists  of  a  light  gray,  single- 
breasted  coat  and  darker  gray  trousers,  worn  with  a  light  blue 
or  white  shirt,  black  tie,  and  black  shoes.  The  peaked,  visored 
cap  has  been  replaced  by  the  beret  as  the  most  common  form 
of  headgear.  Dress  uniforms  featuring  dinner  jackets  or  dou- 
ble-breasted coats  are  worn  by  officers  for  various  social  occa- 
sions. The  battle  and  work  uniform  is  olive  green.  Camouflage 
fatigues  are  also  worn  on  field  duty.  In  all  three  services,  light 
sand-colored  uniforms  are  available  for  duty  in  warmer  cli- 
mates. 

The  traditional  arm-of-service  colors  appear  as  lapel  facings 
and  as  piping  on  shoulder  straps.  General  officers  wear  an 
inner  piping  of  gold  braid;  other  officers  wear  silver  piping. 
Lapel  facings  and  piping  are  maroon  for  general  staff,  green 
for  infantry,  red  for  artillery,  pink  for  armor,  black  for  engi- 
neers, yellow  for  communications,  and  various  other  colors  for 
the  remaining  branches.  Combat  troops  wear  green  (infantry), 
black  (armor),  or  burgundy  (airborne)  berets.  Logistics  troops 
wear  blue  berets,  and  combat  support  troops,  such  as  artillery

or  engineers,  wear  red  ones.  A  gold  or  silver  device  on  the 
beret  denotes  the  individual  branch  of  service. 

The  naval  forces  wear  the  traditional  navy  blue,  double- 
breasted  coat  and  trousers;  enlisted  personnel  wear  either  a 
white  shirt  or  a  navy  blue  shirt  with  the  traditional  navy  collar. 
White  uniforms  provide  an  alternative  for  summer.  The  offi- 
cer's dress  cap  is  mounted  with  a  gold  anchor  surrounded  by  a 
wreath.  The  visor  of  the  admiral's  cap  bears  a  double  row  of 
oak  leaves. 

The  air  force  service  uniform  consists  of  a  blue-gray  jacket 
and  trousers  with  a  light  blue  shirt,  dark  blue  tie,  and  black 
shoes.  Olive  battle  dress  similar  to  the  army  fatigue  uniform  is 
worn  in  basic  training  and  during  other  field  duty.  Flying  per- 
sonnel wear  wings  on  their  right  breast.  Technical  personnel 
wear  a  modified  wing  device  with  a  symbol  in  its  center  denot- 
ing service  specialization.  The  latter  is  bronze,  silver,  or  gold, 
depending  on  one's  length  of  service  in  the  specialty.  Wings, 
superimposed  over  a  wreath,  in  gold,  silver,  or  bronze,  depend- 
ing on  rank,  are  also  worn  on  the  service  or  field  cap. 

Officer  ranks  correspond  directly  to  equivalent  ranks  in  the 
United  States  Armed  Forces  (see  fig.  15).  Officer  rank  insignia 
are  worn  on  shoulder  straps  or  shoulder  boards;  in  the  case  of 
naval  officers,  rank  is  indicated  by  gold  stripes  on  the  lower 
sleeve  of  the  blue  service  jacket  and  on  shoulder  boards  of  the 
white  uniform.  The  semicircular  wreath  on  the  shoulder  straps 
is  gold  for  general  officers  and  silver  for  field  grade  officers. 

NCO  ranks  are  based  on  those  used  long  ago  in  the  Prussian 
armies,  and  it  is  difficult  to  relate  them  directly  to  United 
States  NCO  ranks  (see  fig.  16).  In  the  army  and  air  force,  a 
Hauptgefreiter  corresponds  approximately  to  a  private  first  class 
or  airman  first  class.  An  Unteroffizier,  with  the  responsibilities  of 
a  squad  leader,  is  the  lowest-ranking  sergeant,  followed  by  the 
Stab  sunt  er of fizier,  Feldwebel,  Oberfeldwebel,  and  Hauptfeldwebel. 
Ranks  of  army  and  air  force  enlisted  personnel  are  designated 
by  stripes,  chevrons,  and  looped  chevrons  worn  on  shoulder 
straps.  Naval  enlisted  rank  designations  are  worn  on  the  upper 
sleeve  along  with  a  symbol  of  the  service  specialization  (rating). 
Army  and  air  force  officer  candidates  hold  the  separate  ranks 
of  Gefreiter,  Fahnenjunker,  and  Oberfahnrich  and  wear  the  equiva- 
lent enlisted  rank  designations  plus  a  silver  diamond  on  their 
sleeves.  Medical  personnel  of  all  three  services  wear  a  version 
of  the  traditional  caduceus  (staff  with  entwined  serpents)  on 
their  shoulder  straps  or  sleeve.

Citizens  in  Uniform 

When  the  Federal  Republic  was  founded  in  1949,  and  dur- 
ing the  ensuing  years,  public  discussion  of  the  re-creation  of  a 
German  armed  force  was  unavoidably  shaped  by  the  memories 
of  wartime  disaster  and  the  terrible  legacy  of  German  milita- 
rism. For  many  Germans,  even  the  thought  of  rearming  the 
country  was  distasteful.  Those  citizens  favoring  the  formation 
of  new  armed  forces  were  convinced  that  these  forces  would 
have  to  represent  a  near-complete  break  with  German  military 
history.  The  consensus  was  that  the  military  would  require  a 
constitutional  basis  for  its  existence,  with  the  Bundeswehr 
unequivocally  controlled  by  civilian  authorities. 

The  planners  of  the  new  Bundeswehr  wanted  to  be  sure  that 
no  images  of  the  armed  forces  (Reichswehr)  of  the  Weimar 
Republic  or  Hitler's  Wehrmacht  would  be  associated  with  it. 
The  twin  concepts  of  "citizens  in  uniform"  and  Innere  Fuhrung 
(inner  leadership)  were  introduced  to  ensure  that  there  could 
be  no  resurgence  of  German  militarism.  Behind  the  emphasis 
on  citizens  in  uniform  was  the  concept  that  military  personnel 
were  of  the  people  and  worked  for  the  people,  not  part  of  a 
military  elite  that  would  precipitate  a  "state  within  a  state"  phe- 
nomenon. In  the  new  Bundeswehr,  the  constitutional  rights  of 
service  members  are  guaranteed,  even  though  those  rights 
might  be  restricted  at  times  because  of  the  special  nature  of 
military  duties. 

Military  personnel  do  not  give  up  their  political  status  as  citi- 
zens when  they  don  a  uniform.  They  continue  to  be  members 
of  the  community  from  which  they  entered  the  service,  as  well 
as  of  the  West  German  political  community  as  a  whole.  They 
can  run  for  office  on  local  councils  and  for  seats  in  the  parlia- 
ments of  the  Lander  and  the  Bundestag.  Regulars  and  volun- 
teers are  permitted  to  join  a  military  or  civil  service  union  and 
have  the  right  of  free  expression,  although  by  law  they  have  the 
obligation  to  exercise  discipline  and  restraint  in  expressing 
their  views  publicly. 

The  concept  of  Innere  Fuhrung  imposes  the  responsibility 
upon  all  military  personnel  to  defend  their  country  according 
to  the  dictates  of  conscience  rather  than  out  of  blind  loyalty. 
For  the  NCOs,  officers,  and  generals  who  formed  the  nucleus 
of  the  new  forces  in  1956,  most  of  whom  were  veterans  of  the 
Wehrmacht  or  Luftwaffe  of  World  War  II,  adherence  to  the 
new  principles  meant  unlearning  principles  that  had  guided 
them  in  their  earlier  service.  Officers  and  NCOs  received  train- 


495 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

ing  to  help  them  respect  and  impart  the  principles  of  Innere 
Fuhrung,  including  the  role  of  the  Bundeswehr  in  the  state  and 
society  and  the  duties  and  rights  of  individual  service  person- 
nel. 

The  West  German  military  and  the  political  leadership  had 
difficulty  agreeing  on  the  measures  needed  to  forge  a  new 
democratic  spirit  that  would  break  with  Germany's  military 
past.  Specific  issues  continued  to  be  debated  during  the 
1980s — whether  some  traditions  could  properly  be  carried  over 
from  the  Wehrmacht,  the  place  of  military  pageantry,  public 
oath-taking  by  new  soldiers,  and  attitudes  toward  the  Wehr- 
macht's  complicity  in  the  crimes  of  the  Nazi  period  and  toward 
the  officers  implicated  in  the  1944  attempt  on  Hitler's  life. 

A  strong  antimilitarist  element  within  the  left  wing  of  the 
Social  Democratic  Party  of  Germany  (Sozialdemokratische 
Partei  Deutschlands — SPD)  repeatedly  protested  against  mili- 
tary symbolism  and  public  military  ceremonies.  In  a  wider 
sense,  these  protests  reflected  the  reluctance  among  young 
people  to  devote  time  to  military  service  and  objections  to  a 
NATO  strategy  of  defending  Europe  by  using  nuclear  weapons 
in  the  heart  of  Germany. 

An  innovation  to  help  ensure  civilian  oversight  of  the 
Bundeswehr  was  the  establishment  of  the  defense  ombudsman 
(Parliamentary  Commissioner  for  the  Federal  Armed  Forces), 
who  is  appointed  by  the  Bundestag.  The  ombudsman  is  respon- 
sible for  overseeing  the  administration  of  the  services  while 
upholding  the  constitutional  rights  of  individual  service  per- 
sonnel. All  Bundeswehr  personnel  have  the  right  of  direct  peti- 
tion to  the  ombudsman;  several  thousand  exercise  this  right 
each  year.  The  ombudsman  and  staff  can  also  be  called  upon 
by  the  Bundestag  or  the  Bundestag  Defense  Committee  to 
investigate  specific  problems. 

Personnel  Policies 

Serious  shortages  of  eligible  conscripts  began  to  appear  in 
the  late  1980s.  Because  of  the  declining  birth  rate  in  the  1970s 
and  the  increasing  number  of  conscientious  objectors,  the 
Bundeswehr  struggled  to  meet  its  recruiting  goals.  However, 
the  reduction  of  the  Bundeswehr's  active-duty  soldiers  to 
370,000  by  the  end  of  1994,  as  required  by  the  1990  Two-Plus- 
Four  Treaty  and  CFE  Treaty,  meant  that  the  annual  require- 
ment for  conscripts  could  be  decreased  from  180,000  to 
140,000.  Also,  the  incorporation  of  East  Germany  into  the  Fed- 


496 


National  Security 


eral  Republic  added  significantly  to  the  pool  of  potential 
inductees.  About  50,000  personnel  in  1994  were  career  soldiers 
transferred  from  the  NVA  or  draftees  from  the  new  Lander. 

The  Bundeswehr  has  been  handicapped  by  a  shortage  of 
NCOs,  a  problem  that  is  expected  to  become  more  critical  as 
the  army  increases  its  dependence  on  career  cadres  to  staff 
reserve  battalions  subject  to  mobilization.  A  soldier  must  meet 
high  entry  qualifications,  undergo  extensive  training,  and  com- 
plete years  of  service  before  reaching  the  rank  of  sergeant, 
which  entitles  him  to  make  the  military  a  career  and  remain  in 
the  service  until  retirement.  Reliance  on  experienced  NCOs  is 
a  distinctive  feature  of  the  Bundeswehr,  where  the  ratio  of  offi- 
cers to  enlisted  personnel  is  the  lowest  in  Europe.  An  infantry 
company  may  have  a  captain  and  one  lieutenant,  but  most  pla- 
toon leaders  and  the  company  executive  officer  are  usually 
master  sergeants.  However,  NCOs  of  the  former  NVA  are  gen- 
erally confined  to  specialist  categories,  without  experience  or 
training  as  unit  leaders. 

Service  Obligations 

Under  the  Obligatory  Military  Service  Law  enacted  in  1956, 
all  males  between  the  ages  of  eighteen  and  twenty-eight  were 
subject  to  conscription  for  military  service.  In  1985  the  period 
of  active  duty  was  increased  from  fifteen  to  eighteen  months, 
but  before  the  new  provision  was  introduced,  the  term  of  ser- 
vice was  reduced  to  twelve  months,  effective  in  1990.  Beginning 
in  1996,  conscripts  will  be  required  to  serve  ten  months.  The 
Basic  Law  guarantees  the  right  to  refuse  military  service  on 
grounds  of  conscience. 

During  the  1970s,  about  35,000  young  men  applied  for  con- 
scientious objector  status  annually.  Under  liberalized  rules  and 
the  decline  of  the  overt  threat  from  the  east,  the  number  who 
claimed  the  right  to  alternative  civilian  service  in  1992 
(134,000)  was  about  as  high  as  the  number  of  draftees  needed 
by  the  Bundeswehr.  Alternative  service,  which  is  one-third 
longer  than  military  service,  usually  takes  the  form  of  such 
social  service  as  serving  as  a  hospital  orderly.  In  fact,  one  of  the 
obstacles  to  shifting  to  an  all-volunteer  force  is  the  effect  it 
would  have  on  the  health  and  social  agencies  that  have  come  to 
depend  upon  conscientious  objectors  to  perform  essential 
work. 

Under  Bundeswehr  policy,  all  soldiers  begin  their  careers  as 
conscripts.  Those  performing  satisfactorily  may  be  induced — 


497 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

in  part  through  considerable  financial  incentives — to  volunteer 
for  a  short-term  enlistment  of  two  years,  or  as  temporary  career 
personnel  for  four  years.  Those  attaining  NCO  rank  during 
their  four-year  enlistment  period  may  then  be  permitted  to 
serve  up  to  fifteen  years  or  longer  if  accepted  as  career  profes- 
sionals. The  army  has  been  able  to  recruit  about  10  percent  of 
its  conscripts  for  extended  service. 

The  maximum  retirement  age  of  career  sergeants  is  fifty- 
three.  The  mandatory  retirement  age  rises,  depending  on 
rank,  to  fifty-nine  for  colonels  and  sixty  for  generals  and  medi- 
cal officers.  Special  rules  may  apply  to  particular  specialties. 

Two  branches  of  the  Bundeswehr,  the  medical  and  health 
service  and  military  music,  accept  women  as  volunteers.  As  of 
the  mid-1990s,  about  900  women  were  in  uniform.  No  signifi- 
cant expansion  of  the  role  of  women  is  foreseen,  particularly  in 
light  of  the  overall  contraction  of  the  services.  The  Basic  Law 
states:  "Women  shall  not  be  required  by  law  to  render  service  in 
any  unit  of  the  armed  forces.  On  no  account  shall  they  be 
employed  in  any  service  involving  the  use  of  arms."  Of  more 
than  50,000  women  occupying  civilian  positions  in  national 
defense,  only  a  few  serve  in  higher  civil  service  posts,  although 
officially  women  enjoy  the  same  career  opportunities  available 
to  men. 

Benefits 

The  pay  of  conscripts  amounted  to  about  US$160  a  month 
in  the  mid-1990s.  Bonuses  are  paid  at  Christmas  and  upon  dis- 
charge. Conscripts  can  be  compensated  for  loss  of  their  civilian 
wages,  up  to  60  percent  of  the  lost  income  in  the  case  of  mar- 
ried personnel.  Those  recalled  for  reserve  duty  are  also  com- 
pensated for  lost  earnings.  Longer-term  volunteers  receive 
about  US$1,100  a  month.  Basic  monthly  pay  for  a  sergeant  as 
of  early  1995  was  about  US$1,350  and  for  a  sergeant  first  class 
about  US$1,900.  In  addition  to  basic  pay,  allowances  are  paid 
for  housing  (about  US$600  a  month),  dependents,  hazardous 
duty,  ship  duty,  and  other  special  circumstances. 

All  temporary  career  and  regular  service  personnel  are  enti- 
tled to  a  range  of  benefits,  including  compensation  for  duty  in 
excess  of  fifty-six  hours  per  week  and  change-of-station  allow- 
ances. These  include  disbursements  to  cover  extra  educational 
expenses  for  children;  a  monthly  travel  allowance  to  distant 
duty  stations;  and  a  rental  subsidy  if  local  rent  is  high  in  pro- 


498 


National  Security 


portion  to  income.  Working  wives  are  entitled  to  preferential 
employment  at  new  duty  stations. 

Every  qualified  regular  serviceman  can  expect  to  advance 
within  his  career  category  to  sergeant  first  class  in  the  case  of 
NCOs,  to  captain  or  naval  lieutenant  in  the  case  of  officer  spe- 
cialists, and  to  lieutenant  colonel  or  naval  commander  for  line 
officers.  Upon  retirement,  regular  personnel  can  be  entitled  to 
a  pension  of  up  to  75  percent  of  their  final  salary.  In  addition, 
they  receive  a  one-time  payment  to  compensate  for  the  disad- 
vantage of  retiring  earlier  than  civil  servants,  plus  a  5  percent 
supplement  to  their  retirement.  Special  reintegration  allow- 
ances and  preferential  treatment  for  employment  in  the  public 
sector  are  also  available  to  service  members,  especially  those 
below  retirement  age  but  with  at  least  twelve  years  of  service. 

Defense  Production  and  Export 

Germany's  capacity  to  produce  its  own  arms  and  military 
equipment  grew  simultaneously  with  the  development  of  the 
Bundeswehr.  As  a  matter  of  policy,  arms  production  is  confined 
to  the  private  sector.  There  are  no  government-operated 
defense  plants,  and  most  companies  involved  in  arms  manufac- 
ture are  predominantly  engaged  in  civilian  industrial  produc- 
tion. Private  industry  accounts  for  85  percent  of  all  military 
research  and  development,  procurement,  and  maintenance. 
Nevertheless,  defense  production  represents  no  more  than  3.4 
percent  of  the  total  value  of  output  by  the  country's  processing 
industries.  Although  some  225,000  persons  work  on  defense 
contracts,  this  group  constitutes  less  than  1  percent  of  the 
workforce. 

The  Armaments  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Defense  has 
responsibility  for  planning,  controlling,  and  supervising  the 
armaments  sector.  Under  it  the  Federal  Office  for  Military 
Technology  and  Procurement  (Bundesamt  fur  Wehrtechnik 
und  Beschaffung — BWB)  in  Koblenz  procures  all  defense 
materiel.  The  BWB  is  a  civilian  agency  staffed  by  some  18,300 
persons,  about  one-third  of  whom  work  at  seven  armaments 
research  and  testing  centers,  each  responsible  for  a  particular 
category  of  systems.  Certain  major  joint  projects,  such  the  Tor- 
nado and  the  European  Fighter  Aircraft  (EFA),  are  indepen- 
dent of  the  BWB's  supervision. 

The  Bundeswehr  estimates  that  about  70  percent  of  its  major 
procurement  items  are  produced  as  part  of  international 
projects.  These  have  included  the  EFA  and  Tornado  aircraft 


499 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

(both  developed  in  cooperation  with  Britain,  Italy,  and  Spain) ; 
the  Alpha  Jet,  the  Roland  short-range  air  defense  system,  and 
the  Tiger  PAH-2  antitank  helicopter  (all  joint  projects  with 
France);  and  the  multiple-launch  rocket  and  NATO  identifica- 
tion systems,  developed  in  cooperation  with  several  NATO 
countries. 

Only  in  the  aerospace  and  munitions  industries  does 
defense  account  for  50  percent  or  more  of  sales.  Among  the 
largest  firms  is  Deutsche  Aerospace  (DASA),  founded  in  1989 
to  incorporate  the  aerospace  and  other  defense  activities  of  the 
Daimler-Benz  group.  DASA  has  a  controlling  interest  in  Mess- 
erschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm  (MBB),  located  at  Ottobrunn  near 
Munich,  which  produces  combat  aircraft,  helicopters,  and 
HOT,  Milan,  and  Exocet  missiles.  It  also  controls  Dornier, 
which  produces  various  equipment  and  aircraft  and  which  has 
been  a  major  contractor  in  the  EFA  program.  Motoren  und 
Turbinen  Union  (MTU),  another  unit  of  DASA,  is  a  large  pro- 
ducer of  parts  for  aircraft,  ships,  and  tanks. 

Rheinmetall  Berlin,  another  major  defense  contractor,  pro- 
duces armored  vehicles,  artillery,  and  munitions.  Rheinmetall 
is  based  in  Berlin  and  Dusseldorf.  In  1991  it  assumed  a  control- 
ling interest  in  Krupp  Mak  Maschinenbau,  thereby  adding 
tracked  armored  vehicles,  such  as  the  Marder,  to  its  output. 
The  Krupp  industrial  group's  defense  sector  was  thenceforth 
limited  to  naval  weapons  systems.  AEG-Telefunken  is  a  leading 
supplier  of  electronics  and  radar;  Krauss-Maffei  of  Munich  pro- 
duces the  Leopard  tank. 

According  to  ACDA,  known  German  exports  of  arms  were 
valued  at  an  estimated  US$1.1  billion  in  1993  and  constituted 
0.3  percent  of  total  German  exports;  arms  imports  had  a  value 
of  US$250  million  and  amounted  to  0.1  percent  of  total 
imports.  During  the  1991-93  period,  nearly  half  of  Germany's 
arms  transfers  were  made  to  other  NATO  countries,  notably 
Portugal,  Greece,  the  United  States,  Turkey,  and  Norway.  Swit- 
zerland, the  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea),  and  Finland 
were  also  substantial  clients,  while  smaller  quantities  were 
shipped  to  Singapore  and  Colombia.  In  the  Middle  East,  arms 
valued  at  US$820  million  were  exported  to  five  countries  dur- 
ing this  period,  Saudi  Arabia  taking  US$525  million  and  Israel 
US$200  million. 

West  Germany's  grant-type  military  assistance  to  other 
NATO  countries  focused  on  Turkey,  Greece,  and  Portugal.  The 
major  recipient  was  Turkey,  a  beneficiary  of  German  military

aid  since  1964.  Arms  transfers  included  Leopard  tanks,  Milan 
antitank  missiles,  and  retrofit  kits  for  M-48  tanks.  West  Ger- 
many also  assisted  Turkey  with  infrastructure  and  defense  man- 
ufacturing facilities. 

Although  West  Germany  imposed  controls  on  weapons 
exports,  repeated  charges  have  been  made  that  arms  ship- 
ments by  private  West  German  suppliers  were  not  carefully 
monitored.  In  the  1980s,  evidence  mounted  that  West  German 
firms  were  instrumental  in  assisting  Iraq  and  Libya  in  develop- 
ing weapons  of  mass  destruction.  In  1988,  based  on  informa- 
tion supplied  by  the  United  States  implicating  West  German 
firms  in  the  construction  of  a  poison  gas  plant  at  Rabka,  Libya, 
the  owner  of  one  company  was  sentenced  to  prison  for  illegal 
exports  and  tax  evasion.  In  early  1993,  the  German  govern- 
ment announced  that  German  firms  were  being  investigated 
for  delivering  equipment  for  a  second  chemical  weapons  fac- 
tory in  Libya.  In  a  report  issued  in  1991  by  the  International 
Atomic  Energy  Agency,  thirteen  Western  companies,  more 
than  half  of  them  German,  were  identified  as  having  contrib- 
uted to  the  Iraqi  nuclear  program. 

In  1992,  after  extensive  international  publicity  over  the  inad- 
equate enforcement  of  arms  controls,  the  Bundestag  approved 
legislation  to  create  a  new  government  monitoring  agency.  The 
new  law  authorized  screening  of  mail  and  use  of  wiretaps  to 
facilitate  investigations  of  suspected  violators.  Harsher  punish- 
ments could  be  imposed,  including  confiscation  of  profits  from 
illicit  arms  sales  and  imprisonment  of  company  officers. 

Under  German  arms  policy,  export  permits  are  denied  for 
the  sale  of  weapons  to  areas  of  tension.  This  policy  has  applied 
in  particular  to  the  Middle  East,  where  Germany  felt  a  moral 
obligation  to  avoid  actions  that  could  endanger  Israel.  In  1992, 
despite  a  ban  imposed  by  the  Bundestag,  at  least  fifteen  Leo- 
pard tanks  were  shipped  to  Turkey,  where  they  were  apparently 
used  by  the  Turkish  army  to  attack  strongholds  of  the  rebel 
Kurdish  Workers'  Party.  The  minister  of  defense,  Gerhard  Stol- 
tenberg,  claimed  that  the  shipment  had  been  approved  with- 
out his  knowledge.  Nevertheless,  Stoltenberg  was  forced  to 
resign  from  the  government  in  the  ensuing  uproar. 

In  early  1993,  the  Bundestag  disapproved  the  delivery  of 
submarines  and  frigates  to  the  Taiwan  government,  although 
SAM  systems  produced  in  conjunction  with  the  United  States 
were  approved  for  sale  under  the  rationale  that  they  were 
purely  defensive  weapons.  Diesel  engines  for  a  large  quantity  of

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

French  tanks  sold  to  the  United  Arab  Emirates  were  also 
approved  for  export. 

Domestic  critics  of  Germany's  arms  export  practices  assert 
that  German  firms  have  easily  circumvented  controls  through 
coproduction  schemes  or  deliveries  of  key  parts  to  other  coun- 
tries; through  licensed  production  in  other  countries  of  arms 
that  reach  prohibited  users;  through  the  sale  of  technology  and 
whole  weapons  plants,  of  which  Germany  is  the  world's  fore- 
most exporter;  and  through  sales  of  items  improperly  labeled 
civilian  goods.  Critics  claim  that  the  UN  embargo  on  arms  sales 
to  South  Africa  was  violated  by  false  labeling  of  troop  transport 
vehicles,  helicopters,  and  minesweepers. 

Foreign  Military  Relations 

Since  the  end  of  World  War  II,  the  military  forces  of  six 
NATO  Allies  have  been  deployed  in  West  Germany — first  as 
occupation  troops.  Soviet  troops  were  stationed  in  East  Ger- 
many as  part  of  the  Warsaw  Pact  forces.  Although  the  United 
States  maintained  the  largest  of  the  foreign  NATO  contingents, 
Britain  and  France  also  deployed  substantial  forces.  Belgium, 
Canada,  and  the  Netherlands  maintained  smaller  troop  units, 
heavily  dependent  on  reinforcement  to  be  of  value  in  crises. 
Events  in  Europe  culminating  in  German  unification  in  Octo- 
ber 1990,  the  collapse  of  the  Warsaw  Pact,  and  the  Russian 
compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  Two-Plus-Four  Treaty  to  evac- 
uate its  troops  from  the  territory  of  the  former  East  Germany 
by  late  1994  ended  the  necessity  for  NATO  to  maintain  large 
standing  forces  in  the  European  theater.  As  a  result,  all  NATO 
countries  have  made  deep  cuts  in  their  forces  based  in  Ger- 
many. 

Germany  grants  NATO  forces  on  its  territory  the  use  of  mili- 
tary installations  and  training  areas  free  of  charge — airfields, 
barracks,  schools,  hospitals,  and  logistics  facilities.  Thousands 
of  housing  units  have  been  placed  at  the  disposal  of  the  station- 
ing countries.  The  financial  value  of  German  support  for  Allied 
bases  is  balanced  in  some  degree  by  the  impact  of  Allied  wages 
paid  to  German  employees,  orders  by  Allied  forces  placed  with 
German  firms,  and  spending  by  soldiers  and  their  families  in 
Germany.  By  the  1980s  and  the  1990s,  the  physical  burden  of 
providing  bases  for  large  numbers  of  Allied  troops  had  become 
a  cause  of  widespread  complaint.  Low-level  training  flights  and 
large-scale  exercises  that  sometimes  result  in  injuries  and  prop-

erty  damage  are  particular  sources  of  discontent,  especially 
when  carried  out  at  night  or  on  weekends. 

By  early  1995,  about  100,000  United  States  troops  were  still 
stationed  in  Germany.  United  States  army  forces  in  Germany 
include  one  army  headquarters,  one  corps  headquarters,  and 
two  divisions;  the  air  force  has  two  air  force  headquarters,  one 
tactical  fighter  wing,  one  combat  support  wing,  one  air  control 
wing,  and  one  airlift  wing.  Armor  and  other  weapons  are  stock- 
piled for  units  in  the  United  States  earmarked  as  reinforce- 
ments for  Europe. 

British  forces  in  Germany  numbered  about  38,000  in  mid- 
1995.  British  forces  in  Germany  include  one  corps  headquar- 
ters (multinational),  one  armored  division,  and  an  air  force 
group  headquarters  and  two  air  bases.  Belgium  and  the  Neth- 
erlands maintain  about  10,000  and  3,000  troops,  respectively. 

France  maintained  about  15,000  troops  in  Germany  as  of 
mid-1995,  reduced  from  44,000  in  1989.  Most  of  these  troops 
are  part  of  the  Eurocorps.  The  position  of  France  among 
NATO  countries  maintaining  forces  in  Germany  is  unique. 
French  units  are  not  committed  to  NATO,  and  the  participa- 
tion of  France  in  the  event  of  conflict  is  subject  to  a  decision  by 
the  French  president.  Nevertheless,  French  staff  and  troops 
cooperate  in  certain  NATO  exercises  and  maneuvers. 

International  Military  Missions 

In  July  1994,  the  Federal  Constitutional  Court  decided  that 
Bundeswehr  units  could  participate  in  UN  and  other  opera- 
tions outside  the  NATO  area  if  such  actions  had  the  approval 
of  the  Bundestag.  That  decision  was  preceded  by  much  politi- 
cal controversy  in  the  early  1990s,  including  charges  from 
opponents  of  out-of-area  deployment  of  Bundeswehr  elements 
that  provisions  of  the  Basic  Law  were  being  ignored  (see  The 
Out-of-Area  Debate,  ch.  8). 

During  the  1991  Persian  Gulf  War,  Germany  received  inter- 
national criticism  for  its  unwillingness  to  assume  a  role  propor- 
tionate to  its  military  power  and  political  importance.  The 
strong  pacifist  streak  in  German  society  again  manifested  itself 
in  anti-United  States  and  antiwar  demonstrations  that  contrib- 
uted to  an  impression  in  some  quarters  of  German  indiffer- 
ence to  Iraq's  aggression.  Germany  did  make  a  contribution  of 
US$10  billion  to  the  UN  operation  against  Iraq,  but  its  military 
actions  were  confined  to  the  NATO  area.  German  naval  units 
and  mine  countermeasure  ships  were  shifted  to  the  Mediterra- 


503 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

nean  to  cover  for  NATO  vessels  sent  to  the  Persian  Gulf.  After 
hostilities  ended,  German  ships  took  part  in  mine-clearing 
operations  in  the  gulf.  German  Alpha  Jets  and  air  defense  mis- 
siles were  deployed  to  Turkey,  largely  as  a  political  gesture  to 
demonstrate  solidarity  with  other  NATO  countries  involved  in 
the  conflict  with  Iraq.  Later,  German  troops  and  helicopters 
were  sent  to  northern  Iran  and  Iraq  to  aid  Kurdish  refugees. 

In  December  1992,  the  government  pledged  to  provide 
some  1,600  troops  to  regions  of  Somalia  where  peace  had  been 
restored  to  assist  in  reconstruction  and  the  distribution  of 
relief  goods.  The  contingent  included  specialized  logistic  and 
medical  units  plus  a  small  protective  detachment  of  infantry 
troops.  Despite  political  opposition,  the  government  said  it  was 
determined  to  deploy  troops  to  areas  of  Somalia  where  there 
was  no  fighting.  German  troops  subsequently  participated  suc- 
cessfully in  the  United  Nations  Operation  in  Somalia  II  (UNO- 
SOMII). 

German  armed  forces  participated  to  a  limited  extent  in  sev- 
eral other  UN-organized  operations,  generally  ones  with  a 
humanitarian  purpose  that  would  evoke  minimal  criticism  that 
the  Basic  Law  was  being  flouted.  In  1992  a  group  of  some  150 
Bundeswehr  medical  personnel  went  to  Cambodia  to  provide 
health  care  to  the  2,200  members  of  the  UN  mission  in  that 
nation.  Amid  objections  from  opposition  parties,  a  destroyer 
and  three  reconnaissance  aircraft  were  sent  to  join  forces  from 
seven  other  NATO  countries  in  an  attempt  to  monitor  the  UN 
embargo  of  Serbia.  German  troops  were  involved  in  delivery  of 
food  to  the  besieged  city  of  Sarajevo  but  avoided  airdrops  that 
could  result  in  conflict.  Service  by  German  crews  on  unarmed 
NATO  reconnaissance  aircraft  to  help  enforce  the  "no-fly  zone" 
was  only  narrowly  approved  by  the  Federal  Constitutional 
Court. 

Internal  Security 

The  German  legal  system  is  the  product  of  many  centuries  of 
development,  starting  with  the  tribal  laws  of  the  first  Germans. 
Those  indigenous  customs  were  influenced  and  changed 
under  Roman  law  and  later  by  the  laws  that  prevailed  in  the 
Holy  Roman  Empire.  Feudal  law  also  had  a  strong  influence. 
When  more  formal  law  and  legal  institutions  appeared  in  the 
eighteenth  century,  codes  of  law  and  police  systems  were  left  to 
the  individual  territorial  entities.  The  codes  that  evolved  were 
mixtures  of  German,  Roman,  and  ecclesiastical  law.

The  drive  toward  political  unification  during  the  nineteenth 
century  was  accompanied  by  a  trend  toward  legal  unification, 
especially  in  commercial  matters.  In  other  areas  of  law,  how- 
ever, the  prerogatives  of  each  political  entity  still  governed. 
Only  after  the  achievement  of  political  unification  under  Prus- 
sian dominance  in  1871  was  a  start  made  on  drawing  up  Ger- 
man legal  codes. 

The  codes  and  laws  on  police  and  penal  institutions  adopted 
after  unification  showed  in  varying  degrees  the  influence  of 
the  Napoleonic  Code.  Patterns  were  established  that,  despite 
modifications,  continued  to  prevail.  The  most  important  of  the 
early  models  were  the  Penal  Code  of  1871,  defining  three 
classes  of  imprisonment  still  in  use  in  1995;  the  procedural 
codes  of  1877;  the  law  of  1877  establishing  a  unified  court  sys- 
tem; and  the  comprehensive  Civil  Code,  which  took  effect  in  its 
full  scope  of  2,385  paragraphs  in  1900. 

Parallel  with  the  courts  and  laws,  there  developed  a  structure 
of  penal  institutions  and  a  police  system,  both  characterized  by 
the  efficiency  for  which  German  administrative  organs  had 
long  been  noted.  Although  their  administration  was  somewhat 


505 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 


relaxed  during  the  Weimar  period  (1918-33),  these  bureaucra- 
cies tended  toward  rigidity.  The  police  and  penal  authorities 
saw  their  positions  and  responsibilities  as  servants  of  the  state 
as  overshadowing  any  obligation  of  service  to  the  people. 

When  the  Nazis  came  to  power  in  1933,  they  capitalized  on 
the  tendencies  of  the  legal  bureaucracy,  centralizing  control  of 
the  police  and  administration  of  the  courts  and  making  wide- 
spread use  of  special  courts.  Ostensibly,  the  laws  and  institu- 
tions remained  the  same.  However,  the  spirit  of  the  law  and  the 
legal  system  were  gradually  and  totally  subverted  by  the  agenda 
of  the  Nazi  leadership.  When  the  "sound  instincts  of  the  peo- 
ple" demanded  it,  as  interpreted  by  the  Nazis,  the  rule  of  law 
was  completely  ignored. 

The  impact  of  Nazi  ideology  was  greatest  on  the  Criminal 
Code  and  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure.  The  Third  Reich 
greatly  broadened  the  definition  of  criminal  activity,  particu- 
larly in  the  category  of  crimes  against  the  state,  and  made  pun- 
ishment much  harsher.  The  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  was 
distorted  almost  beyond  recognition  by  the  activities  of  the 
Nazi-inspired  People's  Court,  in  which  those  convicted  of 
crimes  against  the  state  were  often  sentenced  to  death.  In 
twelve  years,  an  extensive  network  of  special  and  summary 
courts  of  indeterminate  jurisdiction  was  developed. 

The  police,  whose  powers  and  responsibilities  were  signifi- 
cantly broadened,  became  tools  of  the  ruling  party  under  the 
direct  control  of  the  minister  of  interior.  The  regular  police — 
including  city  and  town  forces,  motorized  gendarmerie  in  rural 
areas,  and  administrative  police,  who  administered  codes  and 
regulations — were  supplemented  by  much  more  powerful 
internal  security  units.  These  included  the  Security  Police 
(Sicherheitspolizei),  which  incorporated  the  Criminal  Investi- 
gation Police  and  the  Border  Police,  as  well  as  the  newly 
formed  Secret  State  Police  (Geheime  Staatspolizei — Gestapo) . 
Two  other  of  Hitler's  organizations,  the  Storm  Troops  (Sturm- 
abteilung — SA)  and  the  Guard  Detachment  (Schutz-Staffel — 
SS),  in  company  with  the  Gestapo,  became  infamous  as  instru- 
ments of  Nazi  brutality. 

After  World  War  II,  each  of  the  Allied  authorities  permitted 
the  formation  of  West  German  police  forces,  although  under 
terms  that  reflected  their  own  police  structures  and  traditions. 
In  all  three  Western  zones,  however,  the  police  were  decentral- 
ized, democratized,  and  demilitarized.  Some  restrictions  were 
lifted  within  two  years  as  Cold  War  tensions  grew,  and  certain 


506 


National  Security 


police  functions  necessitated  central  rather  than  local  direc- 
tion. The  Federal  Border  Force  was  created  to  handle  special 
functions  that  overlapped  Landjurisdictions.  In  addition  to  this 
force,  federal  agencies  were  created  to  handle  interstate  crimi- 
nal matters  and  overall  security  affairs. 

Federal  Police  Agencies 

Established  in  1951,  the  Federal  Border  Force  (Bundes- 
grenzschutz — BGS)  was  the  first  federal  police  organization 
permitted  by  the  Allied  occupation  authorities.  During  the 
early  1950s,  there  were  frequent  incidents  on  the  borders  with 
East  Germany  and  Czechoslovakia,  and  the  occupation  author- 
ities became  convinced  of  the  need  for  a  competent  border 
police.  Even  though  the  BGS  is  organized  along  paramilitary 
lines,  that  is,  in  battalions,  companies,  and  platoons,  and  is 
armed  as  light  infantry,  it  remains  a  police  force  controlled  by 
the  Ministry  of  Interior  rather  than  by  the  Ministry  of  Defense. 
The  strength  of  the  BGS  was  24,000  in  early  1995.  The  BGS  is 
equipped  with  armored  cars,  machine  guns,  automatic  rifles, 
tear  gas,  hand  grenades,  rifle  grenades,  and  antitank  weapons. 
All  personnel  on  border  duty  wear  sidearms.  Some  units  have 
light  aircraft  and  helicopters  to  facilitate  rapid  access  to  remote 
border  areas  and  for  patrol  and  rescue  missions.  A  coast  guard 
force  (Bundesgrenzschutz-See)  of  approximately  550  members 
forms  a  part  of  the  BGS.  It  is  equipped  with  fourteen  large 
patrol  craft  and  several  helicopters. 

In  addition  to  controlling  Germany's  border,  the  BGS  serves 
as  a  federal  reserve  force  to  deal  with  major  disturbances  and 
other  emergencies  beyond  the  scope  of  Land  police.  The  BGS 
guards  airports  and  foreign  embassies,  and  several  highly 
trained  detachments  are  available  for  special  crisis  situations 
requiring  demolition  equipment,  helicopters,  or  combat  vehi- 
cles. After  shortcomings  in  police  procedures  and  training 
were  revealed  by  the  terrorist  attack  on  Israeli  athletes  at  the 
1972  Olympics,  a  BGS  task  force  known  as  Special  Group  9 
(BGS-9)  was  formed  to  deal  with  terrorist  incidents,  especially 
hostage  situations.  The  BGS-9  won  world  attention  when  it  res- 
cued eighty-six  passengers  on  a  Lufthansa  airliner  hijacked  to 
Mogadishu,  Somalia,  in  1977. 

A  military  rank  structure  similar  to  that  of  the  Bundeswehr 
was  replaced  in  the  mid-1970s  by  civil  service-type  personnel 
grades.  The  service  uniform  is  green,  but  field  units  also  wear 
camouflage  fatigues  and,  at  times,  steel  helmets. 


507 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Another  central  police  agency,  the  Federal  Criminal  Investi- 
gation Office  (Bundeskriminalamt — BKA),  with  approximately 
3,000  agents,  operates  nationwide  from  headquarters  in  Wies- 
baden. Similar  in  some  respects  to  the  United  States  Federal 
Bureau  of  Investigation,  the  BKA  is  a  clearinghouse  for  crimi- 
nal intelligence  records.  It  provides  assistance  to  Lander  in 
forensic  matters,  research,  and  criminal  investigations.  It  is  also 
the  national  point  of  contact  for  the  International  Criminal 
Police  Organization  (Interpol).  The  BKA  enters  cases  only 
when  requested  by  Land  authorities,  or  in  cases  involving  two 
or  more  Lander.  The  BKA  is  involved  in  combating  various  ter- 
rorist gangs,  which  have  plagued  the  country  since  the  1960s. 

Two  federal  agencies  involved  in  security  matters  are  the 
Federal  Intelligence  Service  (Bundesnachrichtendienst — 
BND)  and  the  Federal  Office  for  the  Protection  of  the  Consti- 
tution (Bundesamt  fur  Verfassungsschutz — BfV).  Based  in 
Munich,  the  BND  is  restricted  to  the  investigation  of  threats 
originating  abroad.  It  depends  heavily  on  wiretapping  and 
other  surveillance  techniques  applied  to  international  commu- 
nications. Such  activities  are  authorized  only  to  counter  the 
danger  of  an  armed  threat  to  the  country,  but  intelligence 
authorities  have  pressed  for  the  added  power  to  monitor  sus- 
pected international  traffickers  of  weapons  and  drugs.  The  BfV 
is  primarily  a  domestic  intelligence-gathering  service  con- 
cerned with  espionage,  treason,  and  sedition.  It  has  no  powers 
of  arrest  and  cannot  use  force,  but  it  carries  out  surveillance 
and  supplies  the  BKA  and  other  police  agencies  with  informa- 
tion on  international  crime,  drug  trafficking,  terrorism,  and 
other  illegal  activities.  Its  main  office  is  in  Cologne.  Similar 
offices  exist  in  each  Land;  although  they  cooperate  closely  with 
the  federal  office,  they  operate  under  the  control  of  Land 
authorities. 

Land  Police  Agencies 

Below  the  federal  level,  police  forces  are  organized  by  the 
Lander  and  are  collectively  known  as  Land  police  (Land- 
polizei).  The  forces  are  organized  by  cities,  towns,  or  rural 
communities,  but  all  are  integral  components  of  the  police 
forces  of  the  Land  in  which  they  are  located.  The  Land  minister 
of  interior  supervises  police  operations  in  his  or  her  jurisdic- 
tion. Although  the  internal  organizations  differ  somewhat,  all 
Land  police  are  divided  into  Protective  Police  (Schutzpolizei — 
"Schupos"),  a  uniformed  service  carrying  out  routine  law  and 


508 


National  Security 


order  duties,  and  Criminal  Police  (Kriminalpolizei — "Kripos"), 
who  carry  out  criminal  investigations.  The  separate  Administra- 
tive Police  formerly  had  duties  that  included  the  registration  of 
residents  and  the  issuance  of  passports,  identity  cards,  and  vari- 
ous permits.  These  functions  have  been  transferred  to  civil  gov- 
ernment departments  in  nearly  all  Lander. 

Readiness  Police  (Bereitschaftspolizei — "Bepos")  are  avail- 
able in  each  Land  for  riot  control  although  their  primary  func- 
tion is  training  police  recruits.  The  Readiness  Police  receive 
standardized  weapons,  vehicles,  and  communications  equip- 
ment from  the  federal  government.  An  office  in  the  federal 
Ministry  of  Interior  monitors  and  coordinates  the  deployment 
of  Readiness  Police  units,  which  can  be  called  upon  to  assist  the 
police  of  other  Lander  in  case  of  riots  or  other  civil  distur- 
bances. 

Although  the  Land  police  are  regulated  by  sixteen  different 
legislatures  and  are,  in  fact,  different  police  forces,  there  has 
been  an  increasing  tendency  toward  standardization  of  police 
activities  nationwide.  Concerns  about  terrorism  and  the  growth 
of  organized  crime  have  strengthened  the  movement  to  cen- 
tralize police  procedures  and  operations.  Since  1979  the  police 
of  all  Lander  have  worn  the  same  uniform,  consisting  of  a  for- 
est-green jacket,  brown  trousers,  yellow  shirt,  and  white  cap. 

An  ordinary  police  officer  (Polizeihauptwachtmeister)  wears  a 
single  green  star  on  his  or  her  shoulder  straps,  denoting  rank 
in  the  first  echelon  of  the  police  service.  In  the  regular  progres- 
sion, a  uniformed  police  officer  may  expect  to  retire  at  age 
sixty  with  the  rank  of  Hauptmeister  (four  green  stars).  The  rank 
of  Polizeikommissar  (one  silver  star),  corresponding  to  the 
former  rank  of  police  lieutenant,  is  the  first  step  of  the  upper 
echelon,  which  ascends  through  Ersterhauptkommissar  (four  sil- 
ver stars).  The  highest  echelon  of  the  police  begins  with  Polizei- 
rat  (one  gold  star)  and  culminates  with  the  Land  director  of 
police  (gold  half-wreath  with  one  star).  About  10  percent  of  the 
police  attain  the  upper  echelon,  and  1  percent  reach  the  high- 
est executive  level. 

Unlike  the  military  services,  which  do  not  recruit  women, 
the  Land  police  have  had  women  members  since  the  forces 
were  reconstituted  after  World  War  II.  Initially,  female  officers 
were  assigned  to  cases  involving  juveniles  and  women,  working 
in  plainclothes  without  weapons.  Since  the  mid-1970s,  police- 
women have  performed  general  police  duties;  many  fill  the 
uniformed  ranks,  although  their  acceptance  varies  by  Land.

Germany:  A  Country  Study 

Women  are  not,  however,  included  in  units  of  the  Readiness 
Police  or  the  BGS. 

Police  training  is  primarily  the  responsibility  of  the  individ- 
ual Lander,  although  the  federal  government  provides  assis- 
tance and  coordination.  The  high  level  of  police 
professionalism  is  attributed  in  large  degree  to  the  length  and 
thoroughness  of  training.  The  situation  is  different  in  the  five 
new  Lander  of  eastern  Germany.  Long  accustomed  to  a  compli- 
ant society,  police  forces  of  the  eastern  Lander  have  been 
described  as  understaffed,  undertrained,  poorly  equipped,  and 
woefully  unprepared  to  cope  with  the  challenges  posed  by  the 
growing  numbers  of  skinheads  and  neo-Nazis  engaged  in  vio- 
lent hate  crimes  against  foreign  workers  and  refugees. 

Most  police  recruits  spend  about  three  years  in  combined 
training  and  service  in  the  Readiness  Police,  although  the 
training  time  may  be  shorter  depending  on  previous  educa- 
tion. Recruits  are  exempt  from  military  service.  Training 
encompasses  a  six-month  course  at  a  police  school  that  pro- 
vides a  grounding  in  law,  legal  procedures,  and  police  conduct. 
After  about  six  years  of  duty  as  a  patrol  officer,  an  individual 
with  an  outstanding  record  who  does  well  on  a  highly  competi- 
tive examination  can  go  on  to  two  or  three  years  at  a  higher 
police  school  or  a  college  of  public  administration  to  qualify 
for  the  upper  echelon.  The  very  few  candidates  who  qualify  for 
the  highest  ranks  of  the  police  study  for  one  year  at  the  Federal 
Police  Leadership  Academy  in  Munster-Hiltrup. 

The  Readiness  Police  are  assigned  to  barracks  where  they 
are  organized  along  military  lines  into  squads,  platoons,  and 
120-  to  150-member  training  or  standby  companies.  In  most 
Lander,  the  Readiness  Police  contingent  consists  of  one  600-  to 
800-member  battalion,  but  in  six  of  the  larger  Lander  they  are 
organized  into  regiments.  Duties  vary  according  to  local 
requirements.  In  Hamburg,  for  example,  Readiness  Police 
patrol  the  subway  system,  assist  in  police  raids  in  the  red-light 
district,  and  are  present  at  large  demonstrations  and  soccer 
matches.  Their  units  are  equipped  with  their  own  transport, 
tents,  and  rations,  enabling  them  to  be  shifted  quickly  to  other 
Lander  without  having  to  rely  on  outside  support.  The  Readi- 
ness Police  have  water  cannons  and  armored  vehicles  but  are 
armed  with  lighter  weapons  than  those  of  the  BGS. 

The  Criminal  Police  enjoy  greater  prestige  and  generally 
receive  more  compensation  than  Protective  Police  officers  with 
comparable  service  time.  Most  Criminal  Police  candidates  are 


510 


National  Security 


regular  police  officers  who  have  done  well  in  police  school  and 
in  their  first  years  of  street  duty.  After  rigorous  screening  and 
examination,  a  small  number  are  chosen  to  receive  a  technical 
education  in  criminology  at  a  police  college.  Those  completing 
the  course  then  serve  a  three-year  apprenticeship  before  attain- 
ing full  status  in  the  Criminal  Police. 

Criminal  Justice 

Law  in  Germany  is  codified  and  is  predominantly  federal. 
The  Penal  Code  is  a  revised  version  of  a  legal  code  introduced 
after  the  unification  of  Germany  in  1871  and  is  therefore  influ- 
enced by  Prussian  legal  concepts.  The  system  of  criminal  jus- 
tice is  derived  from  the  civil  law,  rather  than  the  common  law 
that  provides  the  basis  for  the  systems  used  in  Britain  and  the 
United  States.  In  its  modern  development  in  Western  Europe, 
including  Germany,  civil  law  incorporates  ideas  of  nonconfine- 
ment  punishments,  work-release  programs,  and  other  mea- 
sures aimed  at  rehabilitation  rather  than  the  mere  isolation  of 
a  criminal  from  society.  Toward  these  goals,  the  West  German 
state  in  the  mid-1970s  promulgated  the  revised  Code  of  Crimi- 
nal Procedure  and  the  Federal  Prison  Act.  West  Germany  also 
joined  several  other  civil-law  countries  by  abolishing  the  death 
penalty,  which  was  done  under  the  Basic  Law.  East  Germany 
abolished  the  death  penalty  in  1987. 

Even  before  the  unification  of  Germany  was  completed  in 
1990,  East  German  laws  had  been  modified  to  delete  provisions 
empowering  authorities  to  detain  people  for  exercising  free- 
dom of  expression,  association,  assembly,  and  movement.  The 
East  German  prison  population  fell  from  24,000  to  5,000  per- 
sons because  so  many  political  crimes  had  been  abolished.  Fol- 
lowing unification,  West  Germany's  criminal  code  was  adopted, 
with  minor  modifications. 

Criminal  cases  get  their  initial  hearing  at  any  of  the  courts  of 
the  three-tiered  Land  system — local  courts,  regional  or  Land 
courts,  and  the  higher  regional  (appellate)  Land  courts — and 
can  be  appealed  or  revised  from  the  lowest  to  the  next  two  lev- 
els or  from  all  three  courts  to  the  highest  court  in  the  criminal 
justice  system — the  Federal  Court  of  Justice  (see  the  Judiciary, 
ch.  7).  Prosecutions  leading  to  a  maximum  sentence  of  one 
year  are  heard  by  a  judge  of  the  local  court.  In  more  serious 
cases  involving  possible  sentences  of  up  to  three  years,  the 
judge  is  assisted  by  two  lay  judges,  comparable  to  jury  members 
in  a  common  law  system.  Criminal  cases  in  which  the  sentence 


511 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 


exceeds  three  years  are  referred  to  a  Land  court,  where  they 
are  heard  by  three  judges  and  three  to  six  lay  judges.  A  Land 
court  of  appeal  presided  over  by  five  judges  usually  hears  only 
appeals  from  the  lower  courts,  plus  cases  concerning  extraordi- 
nary crimes  in  violation  of  the  Basic  Law,  such  as  treason  and 
genocide. 

Individual  rights  of  citizens  are  guaranteed  in  the  Basic  Law 
and  in  the  country's  statutes.  The  law  prevents  police  from  sub- 
jecting suspects  to  physical  abuse,  torture,  drugs,  deceit,  and 
hypnosis.  The  record  of  the  police  in  conforming  to  these 
guidelines  is  good.  A  suspect  has  to  be  brought  before  a  judge 
no  later  than  the  day  following  arrest,  and  the  judge  is  obliged 
to  issue  a  warrant  of  arrest  specifying  reasons  for  detention  or 
else  release  the  suspect.  A  relative  or  another  person  selected 
by  the  detainee  has  to  be  notified  immediately  of  any  detention 
lasting  beyond  the  day  after  arrest.  Accused  persons  have  the 
right  of  free  access  to  legal  counsel,  although  this  right  has 
been  restricted  in  the  cases  of  some  terrorists  who  used  con- 
tacts with  lawyers  to  continue  terrorist  activity  while  in  prison. 
Bail  bonds  exist  but  are  seldom  employed.  Criminal  trials  are 
held  in  public;  protection  against  double  jeopardy  and  the 
usual  guarantees  of  due  process  are  observed. 

The  judiciary  is  free  from  political  influence  and  intimida- 
tion by  terrorists.  Substantial  progress  has  been  made  in 
reforming  the  court  system  of  the  former  East  Germany  to 
meet  West  German  standards.  Nevertheless,  many  experienced 
East  German  judges  had  to  be  disqualified  for  political  and 
judicial  reasons.  Judges  introduced  from  West  Germany  are 
handicapped  by  the  unfamiliar  circumstances  in  which  they  are 
required  to  function. 

Incidence  of  Crime  and  Incarceration 

Criminal  acts  are  classified  as  felonies  or  misdemeanors,  the 
latter  encompassing  less  serious  crimes  but  including  many  acts 
considered  felonies  in  most  common-law  countries.  Crimes  cat- 
egorized as  misdemeanors  include  extortion,  fraud,  larceny, 
and  even  negligent  homicide.  Felonies  are  punishable  by 
prison  sentences  of  one  year  or  more;  misdemeanors  can  be 
punished  by  shorter  prison  terms,  by  combined  imprisonment 
and  fines,  or  solely  by  fines. 

By  far  the  largest  number  of  persons  convicted  in  German 
courts  are  fined.  In  1991,  although  nearly  600,000  persons 
were  sentenced  for  criminal  acts  in  the  old  Lander,  the  number 


512 


National  Security 


of  persons  committed  to  prison  was  only  about  100,000.  About 
80  percent  of  this  number  were  sentenced  to  a  prison  term  of 
less  than  one  year,  16  percent  were  sentenced  to  between  one 
and  five  years,  and  1  percent  were  sentenced  to  between  five 
and  fifteen  years.  Fifty-six  persons  received  life  sentences  in 
1991. 

Approximately  43.8  percent  of  the  6,750,000  crimes  regis- 
tered in  1993  were  solved  by  the  authorities.  By  far  the  largest 
category  of  crime  was  theft,  which  accounted  for  61.5  percent 
of  the  total,  followed  by  damage  to  property  (8.6  percent), 
fraud  (7.8  percent),  and  crimes  of  violence  (2.4  percent).  In 
the  old  Lander  and  including  all  of  Berlin,  there  were  4,230 
murders  and  incidents  of  manslaughter,  of  which  84.7  percent 
were  solved  by  the  authorities. 

According  to  federal  police  data,  the  crime  rate  has 
increased  since  unification  in  1990,  especially  in  the  new 
Lander,  where  the  crime  rate  before  unification  was  lower  than 
that  of  the  old  Lander.  During  1991  the  number  of  criminal 
offenses  recorded  amounted  to  5  million,  compared  with  6.3 
million  in  1992  and  nearly  6.8  million  in  1993.  To  some  extent, 
the  upsurge  in  crime  was  associated  with  the  radical  upheaval 
in  the  former  East  Germany  and  the  accompanying  loss  of  jobs 
and  benefits.  In  1993,  for  example,  the  number  of  registered 
crimes  in  the  new  Lander  amounted  to  1.4  million,  compared 
with  1.1  million  in  1992.  The  old  Lander  and  all  of  Berlin,  in 
contrast,  had  5.3  million  registered  crimes  in  1993,  compared 
with  5.2  million  in  1992. 

The  large  concentration  of  refugees,  foreign  workers,  and 
illegal  immigrants,  combined  with  weaker  border  controls,  has 
attracted  a  growing  underworld  of  organized  crime  in  Berlin 
and  in  other  major  German  cities,  which  have  a  crime  rate 
three  times  higher  than  towns  with  fewer  than  20,000  inhabit- 
ants. The  most  common  crimes  involve  narcotics,  automobile 
theft  (especially  of  late-model  luxury  cars),  arms  smuggling, 
counterfeiting,  prostitution,  gambling,  and  white-collar  crime. 
Germany  is  both  a  market  for  narcotics  and  a  transshipment 
point  for  drugs  destined  for  Scandinavia  and  Britain.  Mari- 
juana enters  from  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa,  cocaine 
from  Central  and  South  America,  and  heroin  from  Pakistan, 
Turkey,  and  Southeast  Asia. 

Dissidence  and  Terrorist  Activity 

Opposition  to  the  West  German  government  has  existed 


513 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

since  its  inception  in  1949,  and,  in  keeping  with  German  tradi- 
tion, radical  students  have  sometimes  been  in  the  front  ranks 
of  those  protesting  various  policies  and  situations:  the  use  of 
nuclear  power  and  the  presence  of  atomic  weapons;  the  gov- 
ernment's policy  toward  the  universities;  and  United  States 
involvement  in  Vietnam  and  in  the  Persian  Gulf  War.  Violence 
and  injuries  to  both  sides  were  common  in  confrontations 
between  protesters  and  police.  By  the  1960s,  individuals  on  the 
fringes  of  mainstream  student  organizations  dropped  out  to 
form  extremist  groups.  A  lethal  succession  of  terrorist  activities 
followed,  continuing  throughout  the  1970s  and  at  a  somewhat 
reduced  level  in  the  1980s. 

The  left-wing  Red  Army  Faction  (Rote  Armee  Fraktion — 
RAF)  became  internationally  known  through  its  bloody 
exploits  in  West  Germany  and  through  its  contacts  with  terror- 
ist groups  in  other  countries.  The  RAF  was  an  outgrowth  of  the 
Baader-Meinhof  Gang,  which  held  up  banks,  bombed  police 
stations,  and  attacked  United  States  army  bases  in  the  1970s.  By 
1975  some  ninety  members  of  the  gang  were  in  custody.  In  the 
middle  of  her  trial  in  1976,  Ulrike  Meinhof,  one  of  the  RAF 
ringleaders,  committed  suicide  in  prison.  Another  member, 
Andreas  Baader,  was  sentenced  to  life  imprisonment,  but  in 
1977  he  too  took  his  own  life  in  prison. 

By  the  early  1980s,  the  original  leaders  of  the  RAF  had  been 
succeeded  by  a  new  and  equally  violent  group  that  was  Marxist- 
Leninist  in  orientation  and  saw  itself  as  part  of  an  international 
movement  to  topple  the  power  structures  of  the  capitalist 
world.  A  core  group  of  twenty  to  thirty  terrorists  carried  out  the 
most  deadly  operations  of  the  RAF.  Periodic  attacks  were 
mounted  against  United  States  and  NATO  military  leaders  and 
bases  and  against  prominent  German  officials  and  business- 
people.  Demonstrations  were  held  throughout  the  country  to 
support  a  hunger  strike  by  RAF  prisoners  and  to  protest  the 
introduction  of  intermediate-range  ballistic  missiles.  RAF  vio- 
lence had  declined  somewhat  by  1990,  although  the  RAF  and 
other  left-wing  radical  groups  like  the  Revolutionary  Cells  car- 
ried out  attacks  against  United  States  government  and  business 
targets.  In  November  1989,  the  chief  executive  of  the  Deutsche 
Bank,  Alfred  Herrhausen,  was  assassinated.  In  April  1991, 
Detlev  Rohwedder,  the  director  of  the  Treuhandanstalt  (Trust 
Agency),  the  mammoth  agency  charged  with  privatizing  East 
German  state  enterprises,  was  murdered  by  terrorists  with  con- 
nections to  the  Stasi.  In  August  1992,  the  RAF  published  a 


514 


National  Security 


lengthy  statement  admitting  past  errors  and  announcing  a 
decision  to  suspend  the  strategy  of  violence  in  carrying  on  its 
struggle. 

By  the  early  1990s,  attention  had  shifted  to  violence  by  neo- 
Nazi  and  other  right-wing  fringe  groups.  The  fanaticism  of  the 
xenophobic  rightists  was  fueled  by  the  presence  of  large  num- 
bers of  foreign  workers  and  by  the  increasing  number  of  aliens 
seeking  political  asylum  in  the  country.  Legal  but  extreme 
right-wing  parties  such  as  the  German  People's  Union  (Deut- 
sche Volksunion — DVP)  and  the  Republikaner  (Die  Republi- 
kaner — REP)  maintained  their  legal  status  by  avoiding  Nazi 
symbols  and  propaganda  and  keeping  their  distance  from 
smaller  neo-Nazi  groups.  With  members  numbering  mostly  in 
the  low  hundreds,  the  latter  tended  to  be  splintered  and  indis- 
tinct, which  helped  them  evade  bans  and  government  surveil- 
lance. 

Right-wing  extremism  found  new  supporters  in  the  wake  of 
the  unemployment  and  turmoil  that  accompanied  German 
unification.  In  both  the  eastern  and  western  parts  of  Germany, 
outbreaks  of  violence  were  sparked  by  the  growth  of  racial  and 
ethnic  intolerance.  The  federal  police  reported  2,285  acts  of 
rightist  violence  in  1992,  a  sevenfold  increase  over  the  number 
reported  in  1990.  Seventeen  deaths  resulted.  The  greatest 
number  of  perpetrators  were  youths  under  the  age  of  twenty. 
The  police  count  of  known  right-wing  extremists,  estimated  at 
some  40,000  in  the  early  1990s,  slightly  exceeded  the  estimated 
number  of  left-wing  extremists.  Some  6,400  of  these  extreme 
right-wingers  were  considered  prone  to  violence.  Their  attacks 
were  directed  against  asylum-seekers,  migrants  from  Eastern 
Europe,  nonwhites,  and  in  some  cases  homosexuals,  prosti- 
tutes, and  members  of  the  former  Soviet  armed  forces.  Some  of 
the  most  serious  outrages,  such  as  street  assaults  and  firebomb- 
ings  of  hostels  for  foreigners,  occurred  in  gritty  eastern  indus- 
trial centers — Rostock,  Chemnitz,  Cottbus,  and  Leipzig.  The 
west,  however,  was  not  immune  to  such  violence,  and  deaths 
occurred  in  bombing  incidents  in  Molln  in  late  1992  and  in 
Solingen  in  mid-1993. 

The  police  were  accused  of  responding  slowly  when  hostel 
residents  were  threatened  and  of  treating  neo-Nazis  too  gently, 
often  releasing  without  charge  those  allegedly  involved  in  ter- 
rorizing hostel-dwellers.  Courts  handed  down  mild  sentences, 
in  most  cases  probation  or  brief  jail  terms.  Western  police  units 
had  to  be  deployed  to  the  eastern  region  to  help  control  the 


515 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

violence.  Under  pressure  to  act  more  forcefully,  the  federal 
police  raided  premises  occupied  by  the  neo-Nazis  to  gain  evi- 
dence to  suppress  them.  In  December  1992,  the  federal  Minis- 
try of  Interior  banned  four  small  neo-Nazi  groups  and  also 
placed  the  Republikaner  under  observation  to  determine 
whether  the  organization  could  be  banned  as  undemocratic 
under  the  constitution.  A  new  federal  police  division  to  moni- 
tor and  repress  rightist  violence  was  also  announced  at  that 
time. 

These  actions  soon  bore  fruit,  and  in  1993  the  number  of 
deaths  caused  by  right-wing  violence  fell  to  eight  and  declined 
still  further  in  1994.  Tough  sentences  on  right-wing  extremists 
acted  as  a  deterrent  to  violence,  and  a  tightening  of  the  coun- 
try's liberal  asylum  law  in  May  1993  reduced  social  tensions 
about  the  large  number  of  foreigners  living  in  Germany  (see 
Political  Developments  since  Unification,  ch.  7). 

International  terrorist  organizations  are  represented  among 
several  of  the  colonies  of  workers  and  asylum-seekers  in  Ger- 
many. Although  more  than  2  million  Muslims  from  Turkey,  the 
Middle  East,  and  North  Africa  live  in  the  cities  of  western  Ger- 
many, only  a  tiny  minority  can  be  considered  political  extrem- 
ists. In  the  1980s,  members  of  the  Palestinian  groups  Hizballah 
and  the  Popular  Front  for  the  Liberation  of  Palestine-General 
Command  had  been  involved  in  airline  hijackings  and  attacks 
on  United  States  service  members.  During  the  same  decade, 
members  of  the  Kurdish  Workers'  Party  bombed  and  staged 
violent  protests  at  the  offices  of  the  Turkish  government  in 
Germany,  and  the  Provisional  Irish  Republican  Army  carried 
out  several  attacks  against  British  military  targets  in  Germany. 
The  number  of  incidents  of  international  terrorism  abated 
during  the  late  1980s  and  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  however,  in 
part  because  of  more  determined  investigation  and  prosecu- 
tion of  international  terrorism  by  the  German  police  and  judi- 
ciary authorities.

The  literature  on  the  German  military  is  vast.  Readers  seek-

bert,  presents  several  of  Germany's  military  thinkers.  Donald 
Abenheim's  Reforging  the  Iron  Cross,  published  in  1988,  exam- 
ines the  contradictions  between  the  military  traditions  of  the 
past  and  the  modern  concept  of  "citizens  in  uniform." 

The  information  on  current  staffing  levels  and  equipment  of 
the  Bundeswehr  reported  in  this  chapter  is  derived  from  the 
1994-95  edition  of  The  Military  Balance,  an  annual  produced  by 
the  International  Institute  for  Strategic  Studies,  and  Jane's 
Fighting  Ships,  1994-95. 

Geoffrey  Van  Orden,  a  British  general  who  has  served  in 
Germany,  appraises  the  changes  in  sight  for  the  Bundeswehr  as 
it  shifts  to  a  new  role  in  "The  Bundeswehr  in  Transition,"  in  the 
London-based  journal  Survival  Thomas-Durell  Young  of  the 
Strategic  Studies  Institute  of  the  United  States  Army  War  Col- 
lege examines  military  reforms  in  The  "Normalization"  of  the  Fed- 
eral Republic  of  Germany's  Defense  Structures.  The  commander  of 
Germany's  Eastern  Corps,  Lieutenant  General  Werner  von 
Scheven,  describes  how  the  Bundeswehr  approached  one  of  its 
most  difficult  problems  in  "The  Merger  of  Two  Formerly  Hos- 
tile German  Armies"  in  the  English-language  edition  of  Aussen- 
politik. 

In  German  Police,  Erika  S.  Fairchild  discusses  law  enforce- 
ment under  the  German  system,  as  does  Jurgen  Thomaneck  in 
his  article  "Germany"  in  Police  and  Public  Order  in  Europe,  edited 
by  John  Roach  and  Jurgen  Thomaneck.  The  United  States 
Department  of  State's  annual  Country  Reports  on  Human  Rights 
Practices  and  its  annual  Patterns  of  Global  Terrorism  summarize 
the  threat  to  internal  security  and  assess  police  efforts  to  pre- 
vent violence.  (For  further  information  and  complete  citations,

between  the  dollar  and  gold  was  broken,  but  the  institu- 
tions survive.

EEA  is  a  single  market  for  the  free  movement  of  labor,  ser- 
vices, capital  (with  some  restrictions  on  investments),  and 
most  products.  EFTA  members  have  agreed  to  accept  EU 
regulations  in  many  areas,  including  company  law,  educa- 
tion, environmental  protection,  mergers,  and  social  policy. 

European  Economic  Community  (EEC) — See  European  Com- 
munity (EC). 

European  Free  Trade  Association  (EFTA) — Founded  in  1960, 
EFTA  aims  at  supporting  free  trade  among  its  members 
and  increasing  the  liberalization  of  trade  on  a  global  basis, 
particularly  within  Western  Europe.  In  1995  the  organiza- 
tion's member  states  were  Iceland,  Liechtenstein,  Norway, 
and  Switzerland. 

European  Monetary  System  (EMS) — Established  in  1979  by  the 
European  Economic  Community  (EEC — q.v.),  the  EMS 
was  created  to  stabilize  currency  values  because  the  Bret- 
ton  Woods  system  (q.v.)  proved  not  fully  satisfactory.  All 
European  Union  (EU — q.v.)  countries  are  EMS  members. 
The  EMS  is  to  be  succeeded  by  the  European  Monetary 
Union  (EMU — q.v.). 

European  Monetary  Union  (EMU) — The  EMU  is  a  plan  for  a 
single  European  central  bank  and  for  a  single  European 
currency  to  replace  national  banks  and  currencies  for 
those  European  states  that  qualify.  The  EMU  is  the 
planned  follow-on  of  the  European  Monetary  System 
(EMS — q.v.). 

European  Union  (EU) — Successor  organization  to  the  Euro- 
pean Community  (EC — q.v.),  officially  established  on 
November  1,  1993,  when  the  Treaty  on  European  Union 
(q.v.)  went  into  effect.  The  goal  of  the  EU  is  a  closer  eco- 
nomic union  of  it  member  states,  including  the  European 
Monetary  Union  (EMU — q.v),  a  greater  unity  in  matters  of 
justice  and  domestic  affairs,  and  the  development  of  a 
common  foreign  and  security  policy.  To  the  members  of

the  EC,  the  EU  added  Austria,  Finland,  and  Sweden,  effec- 
tive January  1,  1995. 

exchange-rate  mechanism  (ERM) — A  mechanism  of  the  Euro- 
pean Monetary  System  (EMS — q.u),  the  ERM  is  designed 
to  establish  fixed  exchange  rates  among  EMS  currencies. 
Not  all  European  Union  (EU — q.u)  states  are  members. 

General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT) — The  global 
trading  system,  based  on  the  Havana  Treaty  of  1947,  that 
obligates  states  to  follow  the  "most  favored  nation"  princi- 
ple to  avoid  discriminatory  trade  practices.  GATT  was  suc- 
ceeded by  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  on 
January  1,  1996. 

gross  domestic  product  (GDP) — The  total  value  of  goods  and 
services  produced  exclusively  within  a  nation's  domestic 
economy,  in  contrast  to  the  gross  national  product 
(GNP — q.v.).  Usually  computed  over  a  one-year  period. 

gross  national  product  (GNP) — The  total  value  of  goods  and 
services  produced  within  a  country's  borders  and  the 
income  received  from  abroad  by  residents,  minus  pay- 
ments remitted  abroad  by  nonresidents.  Usually  computed 
over  a  one-year  period. 

Group  of  Seven  (G-7) — The  seven-nation  organization  was 
established  in  1973,  with  an  annual  summit  beginning  in 
1975,  to  attempt  to  coordinate  its  members'  economic  pol- 
icies. Members  are  Britain,  Canada,  France,  Germany, 
Italy,  Japan,  and  the  United  States. 

International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) — Established  along  with 
the  World  Bank  (q.v.)  in  1945,  the  IMF  is  a  specialized 
agency  affiliated  with  the  United  Nations  that  takes 
responsibility  for  stabilizing  international  exchange  rates 
and  payments.  The  main  business  of  the  IMF  is  the  provi- 
sion of  loans  to  its  members  when  they  experience  balance 
of  payments  difficulties.  These  loans  often  carry  condi- 
tions that  require  substantial  internal  economic  adjust- 
ments by  the  recipients. 

Land  central  bank — The  central  bank  of  a  German  state  (Land; 
pi.,  Lander)  or  group  of  Lander.  The  presidents  of  the  nine 
Land  central  banks  sit  on  the  Central  Bank  Council  (q.v.) 
of  the  Bundesbank  (q.u). 

Lombard  rate — The  interest  rate  at  which  the  Bundesbank 
(q.u)  extends  credit  to  commercial  banks  in  order  to  cover

Maastricht  Treaty — Treaty  on  European  Union. 

nomenklatura — The  communist  party's  system  of  appointing  key 
personnel  in  the  government  and  other  important  organi- 
zations, based  on  lists  of  critical  positions  and  people  in 
political  favor.  Also  refers  to  the  individuals  included  on 
these  lists. 

North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO) — Frequently 
called,  particularly  in  official  NATO  publications,  the 
Atlantic  Alliance  or  the  Alliance.  Created  as  a  defensive 
political  and  military  alliance  by  the  signing  of  the  North 
Atlantic  Treaty  in  April  1949,  with  twelve  charter  members: 
Belgium,  Britain,  Canada,  Denmark,  France,  Iceland,  Italy, 
Luxembourg,  the  Netherlands,  Norway,  Portugal,  and  the 
United  States.  Greece  and  Turkey  became  members  in 
1952,  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  in  1955,  and  Spain 
in  1982. 

Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development 
(OECD)— -Established  in  1961  to  replace  the  Organisation 
for  European  Economic  Co-operation  (OEEC),  the  OECD 
is  an  international  organization  composed  of  the  industri- 
alized market  economy  countries,  as  well  as  some  develop- 
ing countries,  by  providing  a  forum  in  which  to  establish 
and  coordinate  policies. 

Organisation  for  European  Economic  Co-operation  (OEEC) — 
See  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Develop- 
ment (OECD). 

Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe 
(OSCE) — The  Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation 
Europe  (CSCE)  was  established  as  an  international  pro- 
cess in  1972.  The  group,  consisting  of  fifty-three  nations  in 
1995,  included  all  the  European  countries  and  sponsored 
joint  sessions  and  consultations  on  political  issues  vital  to 
European  security.  The  Charter  of  Paris  (1990)  changed 
the  CSCE  from  an  ad  hoc  forum  to  an  organization  having 
permanent  institutions.  In  1992  new  CSCE  roles  in  conflict 
prevention  and  management  were  defined,  potentially 
making  the  CSCE  the  center  of  a  Europe-based  collective 
security  system.  In  the  early  1990s,  however,  applications  of 
these  instruments  to  conflicts  in  Yugoslavia  and  the  Cauca- 
sus did  not  have  a  decisive  impact.  In  January  1995,  the 
CSCE  was  renamed  the  Organization  for  Security  and 
Cooperation  in  Europe  (OSCE). 

Treaty  on  European  Union — The  agreement  that  established 


599 


Germany:  A  Country  Study 

the  European  Union  (EU — q.v.)  in  November  1993.  It  is 
usually  referred  to  as  the  Maastricht  Treaty,  the  small 
Dutch  town  where  it  was  negotiated  by  the  twelve  Euro- 
pean Community  (EC — q.v.)  members  in  December  1991. 

Uruguay  Round — The  trade  negotiating  round,  under  the  aus- 
pices of  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade 
(GATT — q.u),  concluded  at  the  end  of  1993.  It  pitted  the 
United  States  against  France  and  some  other  European 
Union  (EU — q.v.)  states  over  EU  agricultural  subsidies, 
with  Germany  in  the  middle.  A  compromise  was  reached, 
including  agreement  for  establishing  a  World  Trade  Orga- 
nization (WTO).  On  January  1,  1996,  GATT  was  suc- 
ceeded by  the  WTO. 

value-added  tax  (VAT) — A  tax  applied  to  the  additional  value 
created  at  a  given  stage  of  production  and  calculated  as  a 
percentage  of  the  difference  between  the  product  value  at 
that  stage  and  the  cost  of  all  materials  and  services  pur- 
chased as  inputs.  The  VAT  is  the  primary  form  of  indirect 
taxation  applied  in  the  European  Union  (EU — q.v.),  and  it 
is  the  basis  of  each  country's  contribution  to  the  commu- 
nity budget. 

Warsaw  Pact — Informal  name  for  the  Warsaw  Treaty  Organiza- 
tion, a  mutual  defense  organization  founded  in  1955, 
which  included  the  Soviet  Union,  Albania  (which  with- 
drew in  1968),  Bulgaria,  Czechoslovakia,  the  German 
Democratic  Republic  (GDR,  or  East  Germany),  Hungary, 
Poland,  and  Romania.  The  Warsaw  Pact  enabled  the  Soviet 
Union  to  station  troops  in  the  countries  to  its  west  to 
oppose  the  forces  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organiza- 
tion (NATO — q.v.).  The  pact  was  the  basis  of  the  invasion 
of  Hungary  (1956)  and  of  Czechoslovakia  (1968);  it  was 
disbanded  in  July  1991. 

Western  European  Union  (WEU) — Founded  in  1948  to  facili- 
tate West  European  cooperation  in  economic,  social,  cul- 
tural, and  defense  matters.  Reactivated  in  1984  to 
concentrate  on  the  defense  and  disarmament  concerns  of 
its  members,  the  WEU  is  headed  by  a  council  consisting  of 
its  members'  ministers  of  foreign  affairs  and  defense.  The 
council  meets  twice  a  year;  lower-level  WEU  entities  meet 
with  greater  frequency.  In  1995  WEU  members  were  Bel- 
gium, Britain,  France,  Germany,  Greece,  Italy,  Luxem- 
bourg, the  Netherlands,  Portugal,  and  Spain.  Austria, 
Denmark,  Finland,  Ireland,  and  Sweden  were  observers;

Iceland,  Norway,  and  Turkey  were  associate  members;  and 
a  number  of  East  European  states  were  associate  partners. 
World  Bank — Informal  name  for  a  group  of  four  affiliated 
international  institutions:  the  International  Bank  for 
Reconstruction  and  Development  (IBRD);  the  Interna- 
tional Development  Association  (IDA);  the  International 
Finance  Corporation  (IFC);  and  the  Multilateral  Invest- 
ment Guarantee  Agency  (MIGA).  The  four  institutions  are 
owned  by  the  governments  of  the  countries  that  subscribe 
their  capital  for  credit  and  investment  in  developing  coun- 
tries; each  institution  has  a  specialized  agenda  for  aiding 
economic  growth  in  target  countries.
