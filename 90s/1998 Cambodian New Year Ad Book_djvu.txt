A Unique  Opportunity  to  Advertise  to  Lowell's  Cambodian  Community 
DEADLINE  FOR  BOOKING  ADS:  April  21.  1999 

Back  by  Popular  Demand:  After  the  overwhelming  success  of  our  1998  Commemorative 
Book,  we  are  publishing  an  exciting  new  book  for  1999.  The  beautifully  designed  publication 
will  feature  dozens  of  photographs  of  Cambodian  dance  performances  and  provide  a wealth  of 
rich  cultural  information. 

The  book  will  be  distributed  widely  throughout  the  Greater  Lowell  area.  It  will  be  handed  out 
free  of  charge  at  our  Cambodian  Dance  Festival  at  the  Lowell  Elks  on  May  15,  1999  and  at  the 
Troupe's  performances  at  Boarding  House  Park  and  at  the  popular  Southeast  Asian  Water 
Festival  in  August.  We  will  also  provide  hundreds  of  free  copies  for  distribution  at  area  stores, 
restaurants,  colleges,  and  other  sites. 

Please  help  support  Lowell’s  Cambodian  Community  bv  purchasing  a tax-deductible  ad  or 
message  in  our  publication.  Consider  what  your  gift  will  mean  to  Lowell's  Cambodian 
community  - how  it  will  help  support  our  important  work  with  at-risk  youth  and  preserve 
Cambodian  culture  for  the  enjoyment  of  everyone  in  Lowell.
