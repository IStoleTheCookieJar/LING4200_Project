ABSTRACT 


This  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  has  been  prepared  in  response  to  an  application 
submitted  on  May  25,  2010  to  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  by  PSEG 
Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP).  The  proposed 
actions  requested  in  the  PSEG  application  are  (1 )  the  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG 
Site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Generating 
Station,  Units  1  and  2,  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  and  (2) 
U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  permit  action  on  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit 
application  to  perform  certain  construction  activities  on  the  site.  The  USACE  is  a  cooperating 
agency  with  the  NRC  in  preparing  this  EIS  and  participates  collaboratively  on  the  review  team. 

This  EIS  includes  the  review  team’s  analysis  that  considers  and  weighs  the  environmental 
impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  proposed  PSEG  Site,  at 
alternative  sites  and  mitigation  measures  available  for  reducing  or  avoiding  adverse  impacts. 
The  EIS  also  addresses  Federally  listed  species,  cultural  resources,  essential  fish  habitat 
issues,  and  plant  cooling  system  design  alternatives. 

The  EIS  includes  the  evaluation  of  the  proposed  action’s  impacts  on  waters  of  the  United  States 
pursuant  to  Section  404  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  and  Section  10  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors 
Appropriation  Act  of  1899.  The  USACE  will  conduct  a  public  interest  review  in  accordance  with 
the  guidelines  promulgated  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  under  authority  of 
Section  404(b)  of  the  Clean  Water  Act.  The  public  interest  review,  which  will  be  addressed  in 


November  2015 


NUREG-2168 


Abstract 


the  USACE  permit  decision  document,  will  include  an  alternatives  analysis  to  determine  the 
least  environmentally  damaging  practicable  alternative. 

After  considering  the  environmental  aspects  of  the  proposed  NRC  action,  the  NRC  staffs 
recommendation  to  the  Commission  is  that  the  ESP  be  issued  as  requested. 

This  recommendation  is  based  on  (1)  the  application  submitted  by  PSEG,  including  Revision  4 
of  the  Environmental  Report  (ER),  and  the  PSEG  responses  to  requests  for  additional 
information  from  the  NRC  and  USACE  staffs;  (2)  consultation  with  Federal,  State,  Tribal,  and 
local  agencies;  (3)  the  staffs  independent  review;  (4)  the  staffs  consideration  of  comments 
related  to  the  environmental  review  that  were  received  during  the  public  scoping  process  and 
the  public  comment  period  following  the  publication  of  the  draft  EIS;  and  (5)  the  assessments 
summarized  in  this  EIS,  including  the  potential  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  ER  and  this 
EIS.  The  USACE  will  issue  its  Record  of  Decision  based,  in  part,  on  this  EIS.

EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY 


This  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  presents  the  results  of  a  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory 
Commission  (NRC)  environmental  review  of  an  application  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  at  a 
proposed  site  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  In  support  of  its  proposed  action  of  issuing  a 
Department  of  the  Army  permit,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  participated  in  the 
preparation  of  the  EIS  as  a  cooperating  agency  and  as  a  collaborative  member  of  the  review 
team,  which  consisted  of  the  NRC  staff,  its  contractor  staff,  and  the  USACE  staff. 

BACKGROUND 

On  May  25,  2010,  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  submitted  an 
application  to  the  NRC  for  an  ESP  at  the  PSEG  Site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope 
Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem  Generating  Station  (SGS)  in  Lower  Alloways 
Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  On  June  5,  2015,  PSEG  submitted  a  fourth 
revised  version  of  its  application,  which  also  included  an  Environmental  Report  (ER). 

Upon  acceptance  of  PSEG’s  initial  application,  the  NRC  review  team  began  the  environmental 
review  process  as  described  in  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  52  by 
publishing  in  the  Federal  Register  on  October  15,  2010,  a  Notice  of  Intent  to  prepare  an  EIS  and 
conduct  scoping.  As  part  of  the  environmental  review,  the  review  team  did  the  following: 

•  considered  comments  received  during  the  60-day  scoping  process  that  began  on 
October  15,  2010,  and  conducted  related  public  scoping  meetings  on  November  4,  2010  in 
Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey;

Executive  Summary 


PROPOSED  ACTION 

The  proposed  actions  related  to  the  PSEG  application  are  (1)  the  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for 
the  PSEG  Site  and  (2)  the  USACE  issuance  of  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit  pursuant  to 
Section  404  of  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act  (Clean  Water  Act  [CWA])  and  Section  10 
of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriation  Act  of  1899,  as  amended,  to  perform  certain  dredge 
and  fill  activities  on  the  site. 

PURPOSE  AND  NEED  FOR  ACTION 

The  purpose  and  need  for  the  NRC  proposed  action — issuance  of  the  ESP — is  to  provide  for 
early  resolution  of  site  safety  and  environmental  issues,  which  provides  stability  in  the  licensing 
process.  Although  no  reactor  will  be  built  at  the  PSEG  Site  under  this  action  (the  ESP),  to 
resolve  environmental  issues  the  staff  assumed  in  this  EIS  that  one  or  two  reactors  with  the 
parameters  specified  in  the  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  would  be  built  and  operated.  Any 
new  nuclear  plant  would  provide  for  additional  electrical  generating  capacity  to  meet  the  need 
for  up  to  2,200  MW(e)  of  baseload  power  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey  by  2021. 

The  objective  of  the  PSEG-requested  USACE  action  is  to  obtain  a  Department  of  the  Army 
individual  permit  to  perform  regulated  dredge  and  fill  activities  that  would  affect  wetlands  and 
other  waters  of  the  United  States.  The  basic  purpose  of  obtaining  the  Department  of  the  Army 
individual  permit  is  for  PSEG  to  conduct  work  associated  with  building  a  power  plant  to  generate 
electricity  for  additional  baseload  capacity. 

PUBLIC  INVOLVEMENT 

A  60-day  scoping  period  was  held  from  October  15,  2010  through  December  14,  2010,  and  on 
November  4,  2010,  the  NRC  held  public  scoping  meetings  in  Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey  during 
which  interested  parties  were  invited  to  provide  comments  on  the  applicant’s  ER.  The  review 
team  received  many  oral  comments  during  the  public  meetings  and  12  written  statements, 

7  letters,  and  1  e-mail  during  the  scoping  period  on  topics  including  surface-water  hydrology, 
ecology,  socioeconomics,  historic  and  cultural  resources,  air  quality,  uranium  fuel  cycle,  energy 
alternatives,  and  benefit-cost  balance. 

In  addition,  during  the  105-day  comment  period  on  the  draft  EIS,  the  review  team  held  public 
meetings  in  Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey  on  October  1 , 2014  and  in  Middletown,  Delaware  on 
October  23,  2014.  A  combined  total  of  approximately  75  people  attended  the  public  meetings  in 
New  Jersey,  and  approximately  140  people  attended  the  public  meetings  in  Delaware. 

A  number  of  attendees  at  each  meeting  provided  oral  comments. 

AFFECTED  ENVIRONMENT 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS 
and  SGS  Units  1  and  2,  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The 
PSEG  Site  is  on  the  eastern  bank  of  the  Delaware  River  about  1 8  mi  south  of  Wilmington, 
Delaware,  and  30  mi  southwest  of  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.  The  site  is  about  7  mi  east  of 
Middletown,  Delaware;  7.5  mi  southwest  of  Salem,  New  Jersey;  and  9  mi  south  of  Pennsville,

Cooling  water  for  any  new  nuclear  units  constructed  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  obtained  from 
the  Delaware  River.  These  units  would  use  either  mechanical  or  natural  draft  cooling  towers  to 
transfer  waste  heat  to  the  atmosphere.  A  portion  of  the  water  obtained  from  the  Delaware  River

EVALUATION  OF  ENVIRONMENTAL  IMPACTS 

When  evaluating  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  nuclear  power  plant  construction* 
and  operations,  the  NRC’s  authority  is  limited  to  construction  activities  related  to  radiological 
health  and  safety  or  common  defense  and  security;  that  is,  under  10  CFR  51.4,  the 
NRC-authorized  activities  are  related  to  safety-related  structures,  systems,  or  components  and 
may  include  pile  driving;  subsurface  preparation;  placement  of  backfill,  concrete,  or  permanent 
retaining  walls  within  an  excavation;  installation  of  foundations;  or  in-place  assembly,  erection, 
fabrication,  or  testing.  In  this  EIS,  the  NRC  review  team  evaluates  the  potential  environmental 
impacts  of  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  the 
following  resource  areas: 

•  land  use, 

•  air  quality, 

•  aquatic  ecology, 

•  terrestrial  ecology, 

•  surface  water  and  groundwater, 

•  waste  (radiological  and  nonradiological), 

•  human  health  (radiological  and  nonradiological), 

•  socioeconomics  and  environmental  justice,  and 

•  historic  and  cultural  resources. 

This  EIS  also  evaluates  impacts  associated  with  accidents,  the  fuel  cycle,  decommissioning, 
and  transportation  of  radioactive  materials. 

The  impacts  are  designated  as  SMALL,  MODERATE, 
or  LARGE.  The  incremental  impacts  related  to  the 
construction  and  operations  activities  requiring  the 
NRC  authorization  are  described  and  characterized, 
as  are  the  cumulative  impacts  resulting  from  the 
proposed  action  when  the  effects  are  added  to,  or 
interact  with,  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably 
foreseeable  future  effects  on  the  same  resources. 

Table  ES-1  provides  a  summary  of  the  cumulative 
impacts  for  the  PSEG  Site.  The  review  team  found 
that  the  cumulative  environmental  impacts  would  be 
SMALL  for  several  resource  categories,  including 

demography,  nonradiological  health,  radiological  health,  severe  accidents,  waste,  fuel  cycle, 
decommissioning,  and  transportation. 


SMALL:  Environmental  effects  are 
not  detectable  or  are  so  minor  that 
they  will  neither  destabilize  nor 
noticeably  alter  any  important  attribute 
of  the  resource. 

MODERATE:  Environmental  effects 
are  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but 
not  to  destabilize,  important  attributes 
of  the  resource. 

LARGE:  Environmental  effects  are 
clearly  noticeable  and  are  sufficient  to 
destabilize  important  attributes  of  the 
resource.

(a)  The  entry  “None”  for  Environmental  Justice  does  not  mean  there  are  no  adverse  impacts 

to  minority  or  low-income  populations  from  the  proposed  action.  Rather,  “None”  means 

that,  while  there  may  be  adverse  impacts,  those  impacts  do  not  affect  minority  or  low- 

income  populations  in  any  disproportionate  manner,  relative  to  the  general  population. 

The  cumulative  socioeconomic  impacts  for  physical  impacts,  infrastructure  and  community 
services,  and  air  quality  would  be  SMALL  to  MODERATE.  The  review  team  found  that  the 
cumulative  environmental  impacts  on  land  use,  surface-water  use  and  quality,  groundwater  use 
and  quality,  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecosystems,  and  historic  and  cultural  resources  would  be 
MODERATE.  However,  the  contributions  of  impacts  from  the  NRC-authorized  activities  would 
be  SMALL  for  all  of  the  above-listed  resource  areas,  except  for  land-use  impacts;  physical 
impacts,  infrastructure  and  community  services  impacts,  and  historic  and  cultural  resources. 
The  new  cooling  towers  would  contribute  to  MODERATE  cumulative  physical  impacts 
associated  with  aesthetics  in  certain  locations,  and  traffic  impacts  during  the  peak  periods  for 
building  a  new  nuclear  plant  would  contribute  to  MODERATE  cumulative  impacts  for 
infrastructure  and  community  services.

NUREG-2168 


Executive  Summary 


Incremental  impacts  associated  with  the  development  of  the  causeway  and  the  transmission 
lines  would  be  the  principal  contributors  to  the  MODERATE  cumulative  impacts  for  land  use  and 
for  historic  and  cultural  resources.  Extensive  past  and  present  use  of  surface  water  from  the 
Delaware  River  would  be  the  primary  driver  for  the  MODERATE  impacts  for  surface-water  use 
and  quality.  Similarly,  extensive  past  and  present  groundwater  withdrawals  from  the  local 
aquifer  system  would  contribute  to  the  MODERATE  cumulative  impacts  to  groundwater 
resources. 

Cumulative  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecosystem  impacts  would  be  MODERATE  because  of  the 
loss  of  habitat  from  development  of  the  causeway  and  the  transmission  line  corridors.  The 
significant  history  of  the  degradation  of  the  Delaware  Bay  and  Delaware  River  Estuary  has  had 
a  noticeable  and  sometimes  destabilizing  effect  on  many  aquatic  species  and  communities. 
Building  and  operating  any  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  in  conjunction  with  the 
operations  of  the  existing  HOGS  and  SGS  nuclear  units,  would  contribute  to  MODERATE  to 
LARGE  cumulative  impacts  to  aquatic  ecosystems. 

The  cumulative  impacts  to  taxes  and  the  economy  would  be  beneficial  and  would  range  from 
SMALL  for  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  the  region  to  LARGE  for  Salem  County. 

There  are  few  minority  or  low-income  populations  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  review  team 
identified  no  pathways  for  disproportionately  high  and  adverse  impacts  on  minority  or  low- 
income  populations. 

The  cumulative  impacts  on  air  quality  would  range  from  SMALL  for  criteria  pollutants  to 
MODERATE  for  greenhouse  gases,  based  on  both  their  emissions  and  associated 
concentrations  in  the  atmosphere. 

NEED  FOR  POWER  AND  ALTERNATIVES 

The  review  team  assessed  the  need  for  the  power  that  would  be  produced  by  the  proposed 
project  and  determined  that  if  the  plant  were  to  be  built  on  schedule  (i.e.,  by  2021 ),  there  would 
be  a  demonstrated  need  for  the  capacity  of  the  largest  proposed  reactor  design  in  the  PPE, 
such  that  the  benefits  of  the  proposed  project  (i.e.,  the  power  it  would  provide)  would  be 
realized. 

The  review  team  also  considered  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  alternatives  to 
issuing  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG  Site.  These  alternatives  included  a  no-action  alternative  (i.e.,  not 
issuing  the  ESP),  as  well  as  alternative  energy  sources,  siting  locations,  and  system  designs. 

The  no-action  alternative  would  result  in  the  ESP  not  being  granted  or  the  USACE  not  issuing 
its  permit.  Upon  such  a  denial,  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  in  accordance  with  the  10  CFR  52  (10  CFR  52-TN251)  process  referencing  an  approved 
ESP  would  not  occur,  and  the  predicted  environmental  impacts  would  not  take  place.  If  other 
generating  sources  were  built  to  meet  the  need  for  power,  either  at  another  site  or  using  a 
different  energy  source,  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  those  other  sources  would 
eventually  occur.  The  review  team  also  assessed  the  need  for  the  power  that  would  be 
produced  by  the  proposed  project  and  determined  that  if  the  plant  were  to  be  built  on  schedule 


NUREG-2168

November  2015 


Executive  Summary 


(by  2021 ),  there  would  be  a  demonstrated  need  for  the  capacity  of  the  largest  proposed  reactor 
design  in  the  PPE,  such  that  the  benefits  of  the  proposed  project  (the  power  it  would  provide) 
would  be  realized. 

Based  on  the  review  team’s  review  of  energy  alternatives,  the  review  team  eliminated  several 
energy  sources  (e.g.,  wind,  solar,  and  biomass)  from  full  consideration  because  those 
technologies  are  not  currently  capable  of  meeting  the  baseload  electricity  need.  The  review 
team  concluded  that,  from  an  environmental  perspective,  none  of  the  viable  baseload 
alternatives  (i.e. ,  natural  gas,  coal,  or  a  combination  of  alternatives)  is  clearly  environmentally 
preferable  to  building  new  baseload  nuclear  power  generating  units  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Table  ES-2  provides  a  comparative  summary  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  viable  energy 
alternatives. 

The  review  team  compared  the  cumulative  effects  of  the  proposed  action  at  the  PSEG  Site 
against  those  at  the  alternative  sites.  The  following  four  alternatives  sites  were  selected  for 
review  (see  Figure  ES-2): 

•  Site  4-1  in  Hunterdon  County,  New  Jersey; 

•  Site  7-1  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey; 

•  Site  7-2  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey;  and 

•  Site  7-3  in  Cumberland  County,  New  Jersey. 

Table  ES-3  provides  a  comparative  summary  of  the  cumulative  impacts  for  the  alternative  sites. 
Although  there  are  differences  and  distinctions  between  the  cumulative  environmental  impacts 
of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  or  at  one  of  the 
alternative  sites,  the  review  team  concludes  that  these  differences  are  not  sufficient  to 
determine  that  any  of  the  alternative  sites  would  be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  PSEG  Site 
for  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  In  such  a  case,  the  PSEG  Site  prevails 
because  none  of  the  alternative  sites  are  clearly  environmentally  preferable. 

The  review  team  considered  various  alternative  systems  designs,  including  alternative  heat- 
dissipation  systems  and  multiple  alternative  intake,  discharge,  and  water-supply  systems. 

The  review  team  identified  no  alternatives  for  the  PSEG  Site  that  would  be  environmentally 
preferable  to  the  systems  designs  used  as  the  basis  for  analysis  in  this  EIS.  However,  if  at 
some  time  in  the  future  PSEG  requests  authorization  from  the  NRC  (e.g.,  a  combined  license) 
to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  the  review  team  will  need  to  compare  the 
specific  heat  dissipation  design  chosen  to  the  other  designs  that  were  included  in  the  PPE 
(Section  9.4.1  provides  more  detail  on  this  matter).

Executive  Summary 


BENEFITS  AND  COSTS 

The  review  team  compiled  and  compared  the  pertinent  analytical  conclusions  reached  in  this 
EIS.  All  of  the  expected  impacts  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  were  gathered  and  aggregated  into  two  final  categories:  (1)  the  expected 
environmental  costs  and  (2)  the  expected  benefits  to  be  derived  from  approval  of  the  proposed 
action.  Although  the  analysis  in  Section  10.6  of  this  EIS  is  conceptually  similar  to  a  purely 
economic  benefit-cost  analysis,  which  determines  the  net  present  dollar  value  of  a  given  project, 
the  intent  of  that  section  is  to  identify  potential  societal  benefits  of  the  proposed  activities  and 
compare  them  to  the  potential  internal  (i.e.,  private)  and  external  (i.e.,  societal)  costs  of  the 
proposed  activities.  In  general,  the  purpose  is  to  inform  the  ESP  process  by  gathering  and 
reviewing  information  that  demonstrates  the  likelihood  that  the  benefits  of  the  proposed 
activities  outweigh  the  aggregate  costs. 

On  the  basis  of  the  assessments  in  this  EIS,  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  with  mitigation  measures  identified  by  the  review  team,  would  accrue 
benefits  (e.g.,  the  electricity  produced)  that  most  likely  would  outweigh  the  economic, 
environmental,  and  social  costs.  For  the  NRC-proposed  action  (i.e.,  the  issuance  of  the  ESP), 
the  accrued  future  benefits  would  also  outweigh  the  costs  of  preconstruction,  construction,  and 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

RECOMMENDATION 

The  NRC  staffs  recommendation  to  the  Commission  related  to  the  environmental  aspects  of  the 
proposed  action  is  that  the  ESP  should  be  issued  as  proposed. 

This  recommendation  is  based  on  the  following: 

•  the  application,  including  the  ER  and  its  revisions,  submitted  by  PSEG; 

•  consultation  with  Federal,  State,  Tribal,  and  local  agencies; 

•  consideration  of  public  comments  received  during  scoping  and  the  public  comment  period 
following  the  publication  of  the  draft  EIS;  and 

•  the  review  team’s  independent  review  and  assessment  as  detailed  in  this  EIS. 

In  making  its  recommendation,  the  NRC  staff  determined  that  none  of  the  alternative  sites  is 
environmentally  preferable  (and  therefore,  also  not  obviously  superior)  to  the  PSEG  Site.  The 
NRC  staff  also  determined  that  none  of  the  energy  or  cooling-system  alternatives  assessed  is 
environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  action. 

The  NRC  staffs  determination  is  independent  of  the  USACE’s  determination  of  whether  the 
PSEG  Site  is  the  least  environmentally  damaging  practicable  alternative  pursuant  to  CWA 
Section  404(b)(1 )  Guidelines.  The  USACE  will  conclude  its  analysis  of  both  offsite  and  onsite 
alternatives  in  its  Record  of  Decision.

SCOPING  COMMENTS  AND  RESPONSES 


On  October  15,  2010,  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  published  a  Notice  of 
Intent  to  Prepare  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement  and  Conduct  Scoping  Process  in  the 
Federal  Register  (75  FR  63521-3).  The  Notice  of  Intent  notified  the  public  of  the  staffs  intent  to 
prepare  an  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  and  conduct  scoping  for  an  application 
received  from  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  for  an  Early  Site  Permit 
(ESP)  for  the  PSEG  Site.  The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Salem  Generating 
Station  (SGS)  and  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township, 
Salem  County,  New  Jersey. 

This  EIS  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  provisions  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy 
Act  of  1969  (NEPA),  Council  on  Environmental  Quality  guidelines,  and  Title  10  of  the  Code  of 
Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Parts  51  and  52.  As  outlined  by  NEPA,  the  NRC  initiated  the 
scoping  process  with  the  issuance  of  the  Federal  Register  Notice.  The  NRC  invited  the 
applicant;  Federal,  Tribal,  State,  and  local  government  agencies;  local  organizations;  and 
individuals  to  participate  in  the  scoping  process  by  providing  oral  comments  at  the  scheduled 
public  meeting  and/or  submitting  written  suggestions  and  comments  no  later  than 
December  14,  2010. 

D.1  Overview  of  the  Scoping  Process 

The  scoping  process  provides  an  opportunity  for  public  participation  to  identify  issues  to  be 
addressed  in  the  EIS  and  to  highlight  public  concerns  and  issues.  The  notice  of  intent  identified 
the  following  objectives  of  the  scoping  process. 

•  Define  the  proposed  action  that  is  to  be  the  subject  of  the  EIS. 

•  Determine  the  scope  of  the  EIS  and  identify  significant  issues  to  be  analyzed  in  depth. 

•  Identify  and  eliminate  from  detailed  study  those  issues  that  are  peripheral  or  that  are  not 
significant. 

•  Identify  any  environmental  assessments  and  other  EISs  that  are  being  prepared  or  will  be 
prepared  that  are  related  to,  but  not  part  of,  the  scope  of  the  EIS  being  considered. 

•  Identify  other  environmental  review  and  consultation  requirements  related  to  the  proposed 
action. 

•  Identify  parties  consulting  with  the  NRC  under  the  National  Historic  Preservation  Act 
(NHPA),  as  set  forth  in  36  CFR  800.8(c)(1  )(i). 

•  Indicate  the  relationship  between  the  timing  of  the  preparation  of  the  environmental 
analyses  and  the  NRC’s  tentative  planning  and  decision-making  schedule. 

•  Identify  any  cooperating  agencies  and,  as  appropriate,  allocate  assignments  for  preparation 
and  schedules  for  completing  the  EIS  to  the  NRC  and  any  cooperating  agencies.  By  letter

Appendix  D 


dated  January  24,  201 1 ,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  accepted  the  NRC’s 
invitation  to  participate  as  a  cooperating  agency  in  the  environmental  review  of  the  PSEG 
ESP  application. 

•  Describe  how  the  EIS  will  be  prepared  and  identify  any  contractor  assistance  to  be  used. 

Two  public  scoping  meetings  were  held  at  the  Performing  Arts  Theater  (Davidow  Hall)  on  the 
campus  of  Salem  Community  College  in  Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey,  on  November  4,  2010; 
meetings  took  place  at  1:00  p.m.  and  7:00  p.m.  The  NRC  announced  the  meetings  in  local  and 
regional  newspapers  ( Today's  Sunbeam,  News  of  Cumberland  County,  Gloucester  County 
Times,  and  The  News-Journal  of  Wilmington,  Delaware)  and  issued  press  releases  locally. 

Each  scoping  meeting  began  with  prepared  statements  from  NRC  staff  members  providing  a 
brief  overview  of  the  ESP  application  review  process  and  the  NEPA  process.  After  the  NRC’s 
prepared  statements,  the  meetings  were  opened  for  public  comments. 

Twenty-three  afternoon  scoping  meeting  attendees  and  eight  evening  scoping  meeting 
attendees  provided  oral  comments  that  were  recorded  and  transcribed  by  a  certified  court 
reporter.  Twelve  written  statements  were  received  during  the  meeting.  In  addition  to  the  oral 
and  written  statements  provided  at  the  public  scoping  meeting,  seven  letters  and  one  e-mail 
message  were  received  during  the  scoping  period. 

Transcripts  for  both  afternoon  and  evening  scoping  meetings  can  be  found  in  ADAMS  under 
accession  numbers  ML1 03270568  and  ML1 03270579,  respectively.  A  scoping  meeting 
summary  memorandum  (ML1 03270350)  was  issued  November  29,  2010. 

At  the  conclusion  of  the  scoping  period,  the  NRC  staff  and  its  contractor,  Oak  Ridge  National 
Laboratory,  reviewed  the  scoping  meeting  transcripts,  as  well  as  all  written  material  received, 
and  identified  individual  comments.  These  comments  were  organized  according  to  topic  within 
the  proposed  EIS  or  according  to  the  general  topic  if  outside  the  scope  of  the  EIS.  After 
comments  were  grouped  according  to  subject  area,  the  staff  prepared  responses  to  the 
comments,  identifying  which  were  within  the  scope  of  the  EIS. 

Table  D-1  identifies  in  alphabetical  order  the  individuals  providing  comments  during  the  scoping 
period,  their  affiliation  (if  given),  and  the  ADAMS  accession  number  that  can  be  used  to  locate 
the  correspondence.  Table  D-2  lists  the  comment  categories  in  alphabetical  order  and  the 
commenter  names  and  numbers  for  comments  for  each  category.  The  balance  of  this  appendix 
presents  the  comments  with  NRC  staff  responses  organized  by  topic  category.

D.2.1  Comments  Concerning  Process — ESP 

Comment:  The  Office  of  Dredging  and  Sediment  Technology’s  (ODST)  primary  overall 
concern  is  that  the  final  product  of  the  early  site  permit  application  (ESPA)  process  could  be 
a  conclusion  that  the  PSEG  Salem  site  is  suitable  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  facility,  with  the  resulting  future  inability  of  the  NJDEP  (or  anyone  else)  to  raise 
any  concerns  about  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  project.  This  is  because 
all  environmental  impacts  concerns  are  supposed  to  be  addressed  in  the  ESPA  process  -  but 
they  have  not  (at  least  in  the  application  documents  developed  to  date). 

Further,  this  is  problematic  because  many  of  the  detailed  analyses  needed  to  evaluate  the 
potential  impacts  of  the  proposed  project  are  to  be  conducted  as  part  of  future  State  and  federal 
permit  review  processes.  Likewise,  the  development  of  potential  measures  to  mitigate  identified 
impacts  are  also  relegated  to  future  State  and  Federal  permitting  processes.  Thus,  it  is  not 
clear  if  approval  of  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  facility  at  the  Salem 
site  via  the  ESPA  process  would  preclude  the  ability  of  NJDEP  (and  other  regulatory  agencies) 
to  deny  issuance  of  any  required  permits  based  on  environmental  impact  concerns.

In  part,  this  is  due  to  a  lack  of  specifics  concerning  the  proposed  project  (reactor  design,  the 
need  for  an  off-site  transmission  line,  etc.)-  However,  more  detailed,  site-specific  analyses 
could  be  conducted  as  part  of  the  ESPA  process  at  a  level  sufficient  for  a  preliminary 
determination  that  the  site  is  suitable  for  use.  Issuance  of  a  CZM  Consistency  Determination  by 
the  NJDEP  for  the  project  would  essentially  constitute  such  a  determination.  However,  as 
highlighted  below  in  Comment  A,  although  PSEG  is  seeking  a  CZM  Consistency  Determination 
from  NJDEP  as  part  of  the  ESPA  process,  the  information  in  the  ESPA  documents  submitted  to 
date  is  incomplete  and  not  at  level  sufficient  to  issue  such  a  determination.  (0020-1  [Brubaker, 
Scott]) 

Response:  With  respect  to  environmental  matters,  the  NRC's  ESP  process  is  as  follows:  The 
NRC  regulations  governing  an  ESP  application  reguire  that  an  applicant  for  an  ESP  must 
provide  the  NRC  with  an  ER  that  meets  the  reguirements  of  10  CFR  51.45  and  51.50.  As 
described  in  10  CFR  52. 1 7,  the  contents  of  an  application  must  focus  on  the  environmental 
effects  of  construction  and  operation  of  a  reactor  or  reactors  that  might  be  built  at  the  proposed 
site,  even  though  an  ESP  does  not  authorize  such  construction  and  operation.  In  addition, 
Section  52. 18  requires  that  the  staff  prepare  an  EIS  based  on  the  application  that  focuses  on 
the  same  matters.  Both  the  ER  and  the  EIS  must  include  an  evaluation  of  alternative  sites  to 
determine  whether  there  is  any  obviously  superior  site  to  the  site  proposed.  Certain  issues, 
however,  such  as  the  benefits  of  the  action  and  alternative  energy  sources,  may  be  deferred 
until  such  time  as  the  applicant  submits  a  COL  or  CP  application.  For  the  ESP,  the  NRC 
prepares  an  EIS  that  resolves  numerous  issues  on  the  basis  of  existing  environmental  site 
characteristics,  as  well  as  values  of  power  plant  design  parameters  set  forth  in  the  application. 
These  issues  are  candidates  for  issue  preclusion  in  a  proceeding  on  an  application  referencing 
the  ESP  (i.e.,  such  an  issue  would  not  be  subject  to  litigation  in  a  later  licensing  proceeding).  If 
an  applicant  chooses  the  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  approach,  as  PSEG  has  done  here, 
the  application  postulates  bounding  values  for  these  plant  design  parameters.  NRC  regulations 
allow  an  ESP  applicant  to  defer  an  issue  (e.g.,  the  benefits  assessment),  as  PSEG  elected 
here,  but  also  require  that  a  COL  applicant  referencing  such  an  ESP  address  the  issue  in  its 
COL  application.  An  application  for  a  CP  or  COL  referencing  an  ESP  includes:  a)  demonstrate 
that  the  design  of  the  proposed  facility  falls  within  the  parameters  specified  in  the  ESP;  b) 
indicate  whether  the  site  is  suitable  for  construction  and  operation  of  one  or  more  nuclear  power 
plants;  and  c)  Identify  whether  there  is  new  and  significant  information  related  to  any  issue 
resolved  in  the  ESP  proceeding.  The  Supplemental  EIS  ( SEIS )  prepared  for  the  COL  will  build 
upon  the  ESP  EIS,  should  one  be  issued.  If  there  is  no  new  and  significant  information  on  an 
issue,  the  COL  SEIS  will  bring  forward  the  conclusion  reached  in  the  ESP  EIS.  If  there  is  new 
and  significant  information,  then  a  conclusion  will  be  reached  in  the  COL  SEIS  on  the  basis  of 
the  analysis  of  the  new  and  significant  information. 

D.2.2  Comments  Concerning  Process — NEPA 

Comment:  And  it  does  amaze  me  how  long  the  process  takes.  If  you  watched  the  slides 
today,  you  saw  that  we  don't  get  to  the  final  of  this  first  step,  until  the  spring  of  2013.  So  the 
process  is  a  long  period  of  time,  and  I  think  at  some  time  we  have  to  face,  how  do  we  speed 
that  up,  so  we  can  make  it  less  expensive,  but  still  do  an  excellent  job  of  siting  nuclear.  (0001- 
13-5  [Salmon,  Edward])

Response:  These  comments  provide  general  information  on  the  NEPA  process.  They  do  not 
provide  any  specific  information  related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action  and 
will  not  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS. 

Comment:  The  undersigned  groups  of  the  South  Jersey  Bay  Shore  Coalition  are  writing  with  a 
concern  about  a  potential  land  swap  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  of  New  Jersey.  PSEG  is  seeking 
to  secure  title  to  84  acres  on  Artificial  Island,  from  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers,  for  the 
purposes  of  constructing  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  Salem  4.  PSEG  has  submitted  application 
materials  to  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  demonstrating  their  intent  to  build  a  fourth 
power  plant  at  Salem  and  Hope  Creek.  In  exchange  of  these  84  acres  the  Corps  is  asking 
PSEG  to  identify  and  transfer  ownership,  to  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  of  another  84  acres, 
yet  to  be  determined,  that  the  Corps  would  use  as  a  dredge  spoils  disposal  site  for  its  projects. 

It  is  clear  the  land  swap  is  intended  to  result  in  the  construction  of  Salem  4  on  Artificial  Island. 
The  Corps  affirmative  action  to  remove  the  impediment  of  federal  ownership  of  the  lands  that 
PSEG  desires  for  this  purpose,  to  decide  and  negotiate  a  land  swap,  and  to  take  actions  to 
accomplish  this  negotiation,  all  for  the  purposes  of  constructing  Salem  4  on  this  location,  is  a 
major  federal  action  that  will  affect  the  human  environment  and,  therefore,  is  subject  to  NEPA. 

I  think  coming  in  late  I  was  catching  the  tail  end  that  some  of  these  things  are,  indeed, 
happening,  which  would  have  us  pleased  greatly. 

Additionally,  pursuing  the  land  swap  is  for  the  purposes  of  identifying,  securing,  and  utilizing  a 
new  location  for  a  federal  confined  disposal  facility  that  will  receive  dredge  spoils  from  the 
Delaware  River,  and/or  other  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  projects.  This,  too,  is  a  major  federal 
action  that  will  affect  the  human  environment  and,  therefore,  is  subject  to  NEPA. 

Therefore  it  was  required  that  before  engaging  in  negotiation  and  implementation  of  this  action, 
the  Corps  must  prepare  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement.  And  we  would  suggest, 
considering  the  use  to  be  made  of  this  land,  it  is  most  probable  that  NEPA  would  require  and 
should  require  completion  of  a  full  Environmental  Impact  Statement.  (0001-19-1  [Blake,  Matt]) 

Comment:  The  Army  Corps  needs  to  examine  these  and  other  issues,  including  allowing  for 
public  comment,  and  going  through  the  EA  and  EIS  process,  before  the  Corps  makes  the 
decision,  and  takes  the  action  that  supports,  assists,  regulates,  approves,  and  encourages  to 
construct  Salem  4  in  Artificial  Island  and  create  a  new  confined  disposal  facility  for 
accommodating  dredge  spoil  sites  from  federal  projects.  (0001-19-8  [Blake,  Matt]) 

Comment:  The  undersigned  groups  of  the  South  Jersey  Bayshore  Coalition  are  writing  with 
concerns  about  a  potential  land  swap  in  the  Lower  Alloways  Creek  area  of  New  Jersey.  It 
appears  that  the  Philadelphia  District  of  the  US  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  is  in  negotiations  with 
PSEG  regarding  a  land  swap  of  84  acres.  PSEG  is  seeking  to  secure  title  to  84  acres  on 
Artificial  Island  from  the  Army  Corps  for  the  purposes  of  constructing  a  new  nuclear  power  plant, 
(Salem  4).  PSEG  has  submitted  application  materials  to  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission 
(NRC)  demonstrating  their  intent  to  build  a  4th  nuclear  plant  at  the  Salem-Hope  Creek  site.  In 
exchange  for  these  84  acres,  the  Army  Corps  is  asking  that  PSEG  identify  and  transfer

ownership  to  the  Army  Corps  of  another  84  acres,  yet  to  be  determined,  that  the  Army  Corps 
would  use  as  a  dredge  spoil  disposal  site  for  its  projects. 

We  believe  that  negotiating  and  undertaking  the  land  swap  for  the  purposes  of  allowing  the 
construction  of  Salem  4  by  PSEG  on  this  location  and  identifying  a  new  location  to  be  used  for 
Army  Corps  spoils  disposal,  is  the  undertaking  of  a  new  activity(ies)  and  project(s)  that  are 
being  assisted,  regulated;  and/or  approved  by  the  Army  Corps,  a  federal  agency. 

In  this  process,  it  is  likely  that  the  Army  Corps  is  and/or  will  be  preparing  and  adopting  plans  and 
documents  that  would  encourage,  support  and  guide  the  selection  of  the  Artificial  Island  location 
as  the  preferred  alternative  for  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  facility  in  the  region,  i.e.  Salem  4. 
We  understand  that  through  this  process  the  Army  Corps  will  necessarily  also  be  identifying, 
pursuing,  planning  and/or  using  (including  adopting  plans  and  documents)  a  new  location  for  a 
federal  confined  disposal  facility  for  dredge  spoils. 

It  is  clear  the  land  swap  is  intended  to  result  in  the  construction  of  Salem  4  on  Artificial  Island. 
The  Army  Corps'  affirmative  action  to  remove  the  impediment  of  federal  ownership  of  the  lands 
PSEG  desires  for  this  purpose,  to  decide  to  negotiate  a  land  swap,  and  to  take  actions  to 
accomplish  this  negotiation,  all  for  the  purposes  of  constructing  Salem  4  in  this  location,  is  a 
major  federal  action  that  will  affect  the  human  environment  and  therefore  is  subject  to  NEPA. 

Additionally,  pursuing  the  land  swap  is  for  the  purposes  of  identifying,  securing  and  utilizing  a 
new  location  for  a  federal  confined  disposal  facility  that  will  receive  dredge  spoils  from  the 
Delaware  River  and/or  other  Army  Corps  projects.  This  too  is  a  major  federal  action  that  will 
affect  the  human  environment  and  therefore  is  subject  to  NEPA. 

In  our  view,  the  Army  Corps  is  undertaking  a  series  of  systematic  and  connected  agency  steps 
in  order  to  accomplish  the  goals  of  allowing  construction  of  Salem  4  on  Artificial  Island  and 
utilizing  a  new  location  for  purposes  of  dredge  spoil  disposal  for  Army  Corps  projects. 

Therefore,  it  is  required  that  before  engaging  in  the  negotiation  and  implementation  of  this 
action  the  Army  Corps  must  prepare  an  Environmental  Assessment  (EA).  And  we  would 
suggest,  considering  the  use  to  be  made  of  this  land,  it  is  most  probable  that  an  EA  will  and 
should  require  completion  of  a  full  Environmental  Impact  Study  Statement.  (EIS).  (0003-1  [Batty, 
Sandy]  [Dillingham,  Tim]  [Galetto,  Jane  Morton]  [Goldsmith,  Amy]  [McNutt,  Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine] 
[O'Gorman,  Margaret]  [Schulte,  James]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  Army  Corps  needs  to  examine  these  and  other  issues,  including  allowing  for 
public  comment,  and  going  through  an  EA  and  an  EIS  process,  before  the  Army  Corps  makes 
the  decision  and  takes  the  action  that  supports,  assists,  regulates,  approves,  encourages,  and 
acquiesces  to  construction  of  Salem  4  on  Artificial  Island  and  creates  a  new  confined  disposal 
facility  for  accommodating  dredge  spoils  from  federal  projects.  (0003-8  [Batty,  Sandy]  [Dillingham, 
Tim]  [Galetto,  Jane  Morton]  [Goldsmith,  Amy]  [McNutt,  Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [O'Gorman,  Margaret] 
[Schulte,  James]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  EIS  should  require  clearer  evaluation  of  PSEG's  use  of  the  Army  Corps 
confined  disposal  facility,  the  agreement  to  do  so,  and  any  cumulative  impacts  resulting  from 
use  of  the  site.  According  to  the  ER  4.1-9,  there  will  be  construction  laydown  and  related

activities  located  in  the  Corps  CDF  site.  It  is  unclear  what  long-term  or  permanent  impacts  may 
result,  despite  the  site  use  for  temporary  activity.  The  NRC  should  consider  these  potential 
impacts  and  the  full  range  of  alternatives  in  its  EIS.  Moreover,  the  EIS  should  consider  the 
chain  reaction  of  environmental  impacts  if  the  CDF  is  used  for  another  purpose.  The  NRC 
should  also  examine  the  mechanism  by  which  the  Army  Corps  is  providing  the  use  of  this  land 
and  any  impacts  this  may  have  on  Army  Corps  permit  reviews  or  regulatory  processes  for  the 
Project.  (0018-6  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers-Philadelphia  District  (Corps)  is  a  Cooperating 
Agency  on  the  EIS  for  PSEG's  ESP  application.  As  such,  the  environmental  impacts  of  any 
actions  proposed  by  the  Corps  to  facilitate  PSEG's  ESP  application,  including  the  land 
exchange  described  in  these  comments  will  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS. 

Comment:  PSEG  submitted  an  Environmental  Report  (ER)  to  NRC  in  May  2010  which 
contains  the  project  proponent's  assessment  of  environmental  issues  related  to  site  construction 
and  operation.  The  ER  uses  the  NRC  criteria  established  in  10  CFR  51,  Subpart  A,  Appendix 
B,  Table  B-1,  Footnote  3  to  assess  whether  environmental  effects  will  be  "small",  "moderate"  or 
"large"  (Footnote  #2).  Delaware  Riverkeeper  Network  is  concerned  that  the  characterizations  of 
environmental  effects  by  PSEG  will  be  accepted  whole-cloth  in  an  EIS  for  the  Project,  in  effect 
outsourcing  the  burden  of  drafting  the  EIS  to  the  project  proponent.  This  would  constitute  an 
inappropriate  use  of  the  NEPA  process.  Therefore,  DRN  urges  NRC  to  review  certain  issues  in 
more  detail,  including:  clearer  evaluation  of  PSEG's  use  of  the  Army  Corps  confined  disposal 
facility,  and  cumulative  impacts  resulting  from  use  of  that  site;  water  impacts  including  dredging 
and  construction  impacts;  filling  of  wetlands;  floodplain  impacts;  habitat  impacts  and  impacts  to 
species,  especially  Atlantic  sturgeon;  and  impacts  and  evaluation  of  alternatives  for  cooling 
systems. 

(Footnote  #2):  Small  effects  are  defined  as  "Environmental  effects  are  not  detectable  or  are  so 
minor  that  they  will  neither  destabilize  nor  noticeably  alter  any  important  attribute  of  the 
resource.  For  the  purposes  of  assessing  radiological  impacts,  the  Commission  has  concluded 
that  those  impacts  that  do  not  exceed  permissible  levels  in  the  Commission's  regulations  are 
considered  small.  Moderate  effects  are  defined  as  "Environmental  effects  are  sufficient  to  alter 
noticeably,  but  not  to  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  the  resource.”  Large  effects  are  defined 
as,  "Environmental  effects  are  clearly  noticeable  and  are  sufficient  to  destabilize  important 
attributes  of  the  resource.”  (0018-1  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  The  NRC  and  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers-Philadelphia  District,  which  is  a 
Cooperating  Agency  on  the  EIS  for  PSEG's  ESP  application,  will  use  information  provided  in 
PSEG's  Environmental  Report,  as  well  as  other  publicly-available  information,  to  prepare  the 
EIS.  NRC  and  the  Corps  will  verify  the  information  provided  by  PSEG,  and  will  conduct  a 
thorough,  independent  assessment  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  actions 
(including  actions  proposed  by  the  Corps)  in  the  EIS.  The  EIS  will  assess  potential  impacts  to 
all  relevant  environmental  resources,  and  will  address  the  specific  issues  raised  in  this 
comment:  PSEG's  use  of  the  Corps'  confined  disposal  facility  and  cumulative  impacts  resulting 
from  use  of  that  site:  water  impacts  including  dredging  and  construction  impacts ;  filling  of 
wetlands:  floodplain  impacts;  habitat  impacts  and  impacts  to  species,  especially  Atlantic 
sturgeon;  and  impacts  and  evaluation  of  alternatives  for  cooling  systems.

Comment:  One  final  note  is  that  in  considering  impacts  in  the  EIS,  construction-phase  impacts 
should  not  be  discounted  as  temporary.  According  to  the  ER,  construction--and  therefore 
construction-related  impacts-will  occur  over  an  approximately  five  year  time  period  and  will 
include  site  excavation  and  the  construction  of  safety-related  structures.  (0018-19  [Brown, 
Elizabeth]) 

Response:  The  EIS  will  evaluate  all  reasonably  foreseeable  direct  indirect  and  cumulative 
impacts  of  building  and  operating  new  facility,  regardless  of  whether  an  impact  is  temporary. 

Comment:  DRN  also  stresses  the  importance  of  public  transparency  concerning  the  Army 
Corps'  role  in  this  Project,  including  transparency  regarding  the  Corps'  prior  and  anticipated 
commitments  to  PSEG  that  may  impact  its  permit  review  function.  (0018-20  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers-Philadelphia  District  is  a  Cooperating  Agency 
on  the  EIS  for  PSEG's  ESP  application.  As  such,  the  environmental  impacts  of  any  actions 
proposed  by  the  Corps  to  facilitate  PSEG's  ESP  application  will  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS.

4.6.2  Adverse  Environmental  Impacts 

The  ESP  states,  "Upon  receipt  of  an  ESP  permit,  PSEG  may  choose  to  obtain  a  Limited  Work 
Authorization  (LWA)  to  carry  out  site  preparation  and  preconstruction  activities.  Additionally, 
site  preparation  activities,  some  excavation  work,  and  construction  of  support  buildings,  roads, 
fences,  parking  lots,  potable  water  systems,  and  other  nonsafety-related  facilities  may  be 
initiated  prior  to  receipt  of  a  combined  license  (COL).  These  preconstruction  activities  can  be 
carried  out  prior  to  issuance  of  a  COL  and  are  separated  from  NRC-regulated  construction 
activities."

4.6.3  Measures  and  Controls  to  Limit  Adverse  Impacts 

The  ESP  states,  "In  addition  to  the  general  measures  discussed  above,  the  following  specific 
factors  limit  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  related  to  construction  activities  at  the 
PSEG  Site:  compliance  with  federal,  state,  and  local  laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations 
intended  to  prevent  or  minimize  adverse  environmental  effects  (for  example,  solid  waste 
management,  erosion  and  sediment  control,  air  emissions  ...)

The  ESP  states,  "An  increase  in  daily  traffic  (up  to  3150  construction  worker  vehicles  and 
50  trucks)  is  expected  during  peak  construction  along  roads  passing  through  Elsinboro  and 
Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township  and  Salem  City.  The  composition  of  this  traffic  includes 
passenger  cars  and  light-duty  trucks  of  the  construction  workforce,  as  well  as  truck  traffic  for 
delivery  of  construction  materials  and  heavy  equipment  used  to  support  facility  construction 
(e.g.  excavators,  bulldozers,  heavy  haul  trucks,  cranes,  etc.).  Potential  effects  of  this  daily 
traffic  are  considered  as  indirect  impacts  associated  with  on-site  construction  activities."

4.4.1 .1 .2  Borrow  Pits 

The  ESP  states,  "To  the  extent  possible,  this  fill  material  comes  from  within  the  PSEG  site 
boundaries.  If  additional  off-site  fill  material  is  required,  it  is  expected  to  come  from  existing 
permitted  borrow  areas  such  as  those  used  in  the  construction  of  HCGS." 

Comment 

Comment  1  (  above)  also  applies  to  this  portion  of  the  project.  (0019-17  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  These  comments  refer  to  the  NJDEQ's  assertion  that  the  proposed  action  must 
comply  with  the  Federal  General  Conformity  Act  (40  CFR  93. 150),  which  addresses  air  pollution 
emissions.  The  NRC  will  conduct  a  conformity  determination  under  40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B, 
outside  of  the  NEPA  process  to  determine  whether  additional  mitigation  is  warranted.  If  an  ESP 
is  issued,  the  PSEG  would  be  required  to  comply  with  all  Federal,  State,  and  local  laws  and 
regulations  regarding  air  quality. 

Comment:  The  Division  of  Land  Use  Regulation  has  received  the  PSEG  Early  Site  Permit 
(ESP)  application  and  has  determined  that  the  project  will  require  permits. 

As  proposed,  the  project  will  require  a  CAFRA  Individual  Permit,  Coastal  Wetlands  Permit, 
Waterfront  Development  Permit  and  Freshwater  Wetlands  Individual  Permit  from  the  Division. 
These  permits  must  be  obtained  prior  to  any  construction  activities  on  the  site  related  to  the 
project  described  above.  The  Division  has  issued  a  consistency  determination  for  the  project 
that  was  sent  to  PSE&G  representatives  on  July  19,  2010.  (0019-21  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  If  an  ESP  is  issued,  PSEG  would  be  required  to  obtain  all  necessary  Federal, 

State,  and  local  permits,  and  to  comply  with  all  Federal,  State,  and  local  laws  and  regulations. 

Comment:  PSEG  is  seeking  a  Coastal  Zone  Consistency  Determination  from  NJ  as  part  of  the 
ESPA  process  (Environmental  Report,  Section  1.3,  page,  1.3-1).  The  Department's  CZM 
review  must  consider  the  potential  impacts  resulting  from  dredging  and  dredged  material 
management  activities  associated  with  the  proposed  project.  (0020-2  [Brubaker,  Scott])

Response:  Potential  impacts  from  dredging  and  dredged  material  management  will  be 
evaluated  in  EIS  Chapter  4,  5,  and  7. 

Comment:  The  EIS  should  require  clearer  evaluation  of  PSEG's  use  of  the  Army  Corps 
confined  disposal  facility,  the  agreement  to  do  so,  and  any  cumulative  impacts  resulting  from 
use  of  the  site.  According  to  the  ER  4.1-9,  there  will  be  construction  laydown  and  related 
activities  located  in  the  Corps  CDF  site.  It  is  unclear  what  long-term  or  permanent  impacts  may 
result,  despite  the  site  use  for  temporary  activity.  The  NRC  should  consider  these  potential 
impacts  and  the  full  range  of  alternatives  in  its  EIS.  Moreover,  the  EIS  should  consider  the 
chain  reaction  of  environmental  impacts  if  the  CDF  is  used  for  another  purpose.  The  NRC 
should  also  examine  the  mechanism  by  which  the  Army  Corps  is  providing  the  use  of  this  land 
and  any  impacts  this  may  have  on  Army  Corps  permit  reviews  or  regulatory  processes  for  the 
Project.  (0018-7  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  Impacts  to  onsite  and  off-site  land  use  will  be  evaluated  in  EIS  Sections  4. 7,  5. 7, 
and  7. 7. 

Comment:  (1 )  SSAR,  Section  1 .2.1 ,  page  1 .2-1 ,  para.  #1  and  para.  #2:  states  that  PSEG  is 
planning  to  acquire  85  acres  of  land,  located  immediately  north  of  the  Hope  Creek  Generating 
Station,  from  the  United  States  Army  Corp  of  Engineers  (USACE).  This  land  is  part  of  the 
Artificial  Island  Upland  Confined  Disposal  Facility  (CDF)  used  by  the  USACE  for  the  disposal  of 
sediments  dredged  from  the  Delaware  River.  The  document  also  notes  that  the  specific  timing 
of  this  acquisition  is  not  known.  Paragraph  #2  states  that  PSEG  will  obtain  a  lease  on  the 
remaining  portion  (~  45  acres  -  see  Section  1 .2.2)  of  the  upland  CDF  for  temporary  (duration 
unspecified)  construction  purposes.  [Note:  also  see  ER  Sections  2.1.1, 2. 2. 1.1,  and  2. 8. 1.2.] 

The  potential  impacts  of  these  acquisition  and  lease  activities  on  the  future  dredged  material 
disposal  capacity  available  to  the  USACE  for  deepening  and  maintenance  dredging  activities 
needs  to  be  evaluated.  If  acquisition  of/leasing  this  land  by  PSEG  will  result  in  the  need  for  the 
USACE  to  develop  additional  upland  CDFs  to  meet  its  dredged  material  disposal  needs,  this 
indirect/cumulative  impact  of  the  proposed  PSEG  project  must  be  evaluated.  (0020-4  [Brubaker, 
Scott]) 

Response:  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers-Philadelphia  District  is  a  Cooperating  Agency 
on  the  EIS  for  PSEG's  ESP  application.  As  such,  the  environmental  impacts  of  any  actions 
proposed  by  the  Corps  to  facilitate  PSEG's  ESP  application,  including  the  land  exchange 
described  in  these  comments  will  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS. 

Comment:  (2)  SSAR,  Section  2.1 .2.1 ,  page  2.1-2,  para.  #2:  indicates  that  the  use  of  146 
acres  of  land  currently  owned  by  USACE  may  ultimately  be  controlled  by  PSEG.  See  Comment 
#1  -  potential  impacts  of  such  PSEG  use  control  of  this  land  on  the  USACE's  dredged  material 
disposal  capacity  should  be  addressed.

Response:  Issues  related  to  land  use,  including  the  proposed  action's  consistency  with  New 
Jersey's  Coastal  Zone  Management  and  Waterfront  Development  Permit  programs,  will  be 
addressed  in  EIS  Sections  2.2,  4. 7,  5. 7,  and  7. 7. 

Comment:  (7)  ER,  Section,  4.1 .1 .1 ,  page  4.1-4,  para.  #2:  states  that  PSEG  use  of  45  acres  of 
the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  will  not  impact  the  use  of  the  remaining  portion  of  the 
facility.  Additional  evaluation  is  needed  to  verify  this  statement.  (0020-7  [Brubaker,  Scott])

Comment:  (9)  ER,  Section  4.2.1 .1 .4,  page  4.2-5:  briefly  describes  construction  and  dredging 
activities  along  the  Delaware  River  shoreline.  A  total  area  of  92  acres  -  approximately  590,000 
CY  of  sediment  -  is  proposed  to  be  dredged.  The  document  concludes  that  impacts  associated 
with  dredging  are  small.  However,  much  more  work  is  needed  to  comprehensively  evaluate  the 
potential  impacts  resulting  from  dredging  and  dredged  material  management  activities  -  see 
Comment  #8.  (0020-11  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Comment:  (1 1 )  ER,  Section  4.3.1 ,  page  4.3-1 ,  para.  #5:  references  a  permitted  disposal 
facility  on  the  PSEG  site  [that]  is  used  for  disposal  of  materials  dredged  from  the  intake 
structures  ...  Is  this  referring  to  an  existing  dredged  material  upland  CDF  on  the  PSEG 
property?  If  so,  this  facility  should  be  identified  in  an  appropriate  figure  and  described  in  more 
detail.  [Note:  also  see  Sections  2.3.1 .1 ,2.4.1 .3.4,  and  2. 4. 2. 1.1]  (0020-16  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Comment:  (12)  ER,  Section  4. 3. 2. 3,  page  4.3-19,  para.  #3:  see  Comment  #9.  The -590,000 
CY  of  sediments  to  be  dredged  have  not  been  tested/evaluated,  nor  has  a  disposal  site  been 
selected.  (0020-18  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Comment:  (8)  ER  Section  4.1 .2.2,  page  4.1-7:  indicates  that  dredged  material  from  the 
USACE  Artificial  Island  CDF  and  from  dredging  activities  associated  with  the  intake  and  barge 
facility  areas  would  be  used  as  fill  material  on-site. 

At  a  May  9,  2010  meeting  with  the  NJDEP,  PSEG  representatives  indicated  that  dredging  of

project  -  this  has  apparently  been  reduced  to  ~  590,000  CY  (see  Comment  #9).  All  dredging 
and  dredged  material  management  activities  associated  with  the  construction  of  the  proposed 
project  must  be  described  and  comprehensively  evaluated.  This  would  include  testing  of 
dredged  material  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the  1997  NJDEP  Dredging  Technical 
Manual.  The  documents  submitted  in  support  of  the  ESPA  barely  discuss  dredging  and 
dredged  material  aspects  of  the  proposed  project.  Section  2.3.1  of  the  Environmental  Report 
only  briefly  summarizes  some  Delaware  River  sediment  samples  collected  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
project  site  and  subjected  only  to  grain  size  analyses. 

Dredging  and  dredged  material  management  activities  will  also  require  a  variety  of  permits  from 
the  NJDEP,  including  a  CZM  Consistency  Determination.  The  use  of  any  dredged  material  as 
on-site  fill  -  including  material  excavated  from  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  -  will 
require  an  Acceptable  Use  Determination  from  the  Department. 

At  the  May  9,  2010  meeting,  it  was  also  stated  that  construction  of  a  new  dredged  material 
upland  CDF  on  the  PSEG  property  may  be  needed.  If  still  needed,  the  potential  impacts  of  the 
construction  and  use  of  such  a  facility  must  also  be  comprehensively  evaluated  and  approved 
by  the  Department,  consistent  with  the  requirements  specified  in  the  1997  NJDEP  Dredging 
Technical  Manual.  (0020-8  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Impacts  to  land  use  associated  with  dredging  and  the  management  of  dredged 
material  will  be  evaluated  in  EIS  Sections  4. 1,  5. 1,  and  7.1.  In  addition,  the  EIS  (Chapter  2  and 
3)  will  provide  figures  of  the  proposed  PSEG  ESP  site  layout  and  supporting  structures. 

Comment:  (16)  ER,  Section  2.8.1 .2,  page  2.8-3,  para.  #2:  delegates  the  evaluation  of  the 
potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  transfer  of  a  portion  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland 
CDF  to  PSEG  to  a  future  federal  review  process.  As  noted  in  this  paragraph,  this  transfer  is 
expected  to  be  a  relevant  factor  to  the  overall  nature  and  composition  of  impacts  associated 
with  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  new  plant.  Therefore,  the  impacts  of  this  proposed 
land  transfer  should  be  evaluated  as  part  of  the  ESPA  process.  Also  see  Comment  B  and 
Comments  #1,  #2,  and  #7.  (0020-25  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers-Philadelphia  District  is  a  Cooperating  Agency 
on  the  EIS  for  PSEG's  ESP  application.  As  such,  the  environmental  impacts  of  any  actions 
proposed  by  the  Corps  to  facilitate  PSEG's  ESP  application,  including  the  land  exchange 
described  in  these  comments  will  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS. 

Comment:  The  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  and  PSEG  must  consider  an  alternative  to  the  land 
swap,  such  as  using  the  existing  road  to  Artificial  Island,  instead  of  creating  a  second  road  if, 
and  when,  a  nuclear  facility  is  permitted.  In  our  view  the  existing  access  road  should  be 
sufficient.  Issues  associated  with  new  spoil  disposal  site  are,  as  yet,  unknown,  as  the  sites 
under  consideration  are  unknown.  But  there  are  likely  to  be  issues,  considering  the  Army  Corps 
of  Engineers  for  riverfront  lands.  (0001-19-9  [Blake,  Matt]) 

Response:  Impacts  to  land  use  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway  and  the  management 
of  dredged  material  will  be  evaluated  in  EIS  Sections  4. 1,  5. 1,  and  7. 7.

Comment:  Although  the  existing  PSEG  nuclear  complex  is  an  ideal  location  for  an  additional 
unit,  because  all  of  the  important  conveyance  systems  are  in  place,  and  those  will  not  have  to 
be  developed,  such  as  they  would  if  it  was  a  greenfield  site.  New  improvements,  such  as 
roadways,  should  be  carefully  placed  and  designed  to  minimize  their  impact  on  marshlands.  An 
elevated  road  system  would  be  a  design  that  would  help  minimize  these  impacts.  We 
encourage  PSEG  to  pursue  such  a  design,  and  develop  a  comprehensive  wetlands  mitigation 
and  compensation  plan  for  these  impacts.  (0001-8-12  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Response:  Impacts  to  land  use  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway  will  be  evaluated  in 
EIS  Sections  4. 7,  5. 7,  and  7. 7. 

Comment:  The  undersigned  groups  of  the  South  Jersey  Bayshore  Coalition  are  writing  with 
concerns  about  a  potential  land  swap  in  the  Lower  Alloways  Creek  area  of  New  Jersey.  It 
appears  that  the  Philadelphia  District  of  the  US  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  is  in  negotiations  with 
PSEG  regarding  a  land  swap  of  84  acres.  PSEG  is  seeking  to  secure  title  to  84  acres  on 
Artificial  Island  from  the  Army  Corps  for  the  purposes  of  constructing  a  new  nuclear  power  plant, 
(Salem  4).  PSEG  has  submitted  application  materials  to  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission 
(NRC)  demonstrating  their  intent  to  build  a  4th  nuclear  plant  at  the  Salem-Hope  Creek  site.  In 
exchange  for  these  84  acres,  the  Army  Corps  is  asking  that  PSEG  identify  and  transfer 
ownership  to  the  Army  Corps  of  another  84  acres,  yet  to  be  determined,  that  the  Army  Corps 
would  use  as  a  dredge  spoil  disposal  site  for  its  projects. 

We  believe  that  negotiating  and  undertaking  the  land  swap  for  the  purposes  of  allowing  the 
construction  of  Salem  4  by  PSEG  on  this  location  and  identifying  a  new  location  to  be  used  for 
Army  Corps  spoils  disposal,  is  the  undertaking  of  a  new  activity(ies)  and  project(s)  that  are 
being  assisted,  regulated;  and/or  approved  by  the  Army  Corps,  a  federal  agency. 

In  this  process,  it  is  likely  that  the  Army  Corps  is  and/or  will  be  preparing  and  adopting  plans  and 
documents  that  would  encourage,  support  and  guide  the  selection  of  the  Artificial  Island  location 
as  the  preferred  alternative  for  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  facility  in  the  region,  i.e.  Salem  4. 
We  understand  that  through  this  process  the  Army  Corps  will  necessarily  also  be  identifying, 
pursuing,  planning  and/or  using  (including  adopting  plans  and  documents)  a  new  location  for  a 
federal  confined  disposal  facility  for  dredge  spoils. 

It  is  clear  the  land  swap  is  intended  to  result  in  the  construction  of  Salem  4  on  Artificial  Island. 
The  Army  Corps'  affirmative  action  to  remove  the  impediment  of  federal  ownership  of  the  lands 
PSEG  desires  for  this  purpose,  to  decide  to  negotiate  a  land  swap,  and  to  take  actions  to 
accomplish  this  negotiation,  all  for  the  purposes  of  constructing  Salem  4  in  this  location,  is  a 
major  federal  action  that  will  affect  the  human  environment  and  therefore  is  subject  to  NEPA. 

Additionally,  pursuing  the  land  swap  is  for  the  purposes  of  identifying,  securing  and  utilizing  a 
new  location  for  a  federal  confined  disposal  facility  that  will  receive  dredge  spoils  from  the 
Delaware  River  and/or  other  Army  Corps  projects.  This  too  is  a  major  federal  action  that  will 
affect  the  human  environment  and  therefore  is  subject  to  NEPA. 

In  our  view,  the  Army  Corps  is  undertaking  a  series  of  systematic  and  connected  agency  steps 
in  order  to  accomplish  the  goals  of  allowing  construction  of  Salem  4  on  Artificial  Island  and 


NUREG-2168

utilizing  a  new  location  for  purposes  of  dredge  spoil  disposal  for  Army  Corps  projects. 

Therefore,  it  is  required  that  before  engaging  in  the  negotiation  and  implementation  of  this 
action  the  Army  Corps  must  prepare  an  Environmental  Assessment  (EA).  And  we  would 
suggest,  considering  the  use  to  be  made  of  this  land,  it  is  most  probable  that  an  EA  will  and 
should  require  completion  of  a  full  Environmental  Impact  Study  Statement.  (EIS).  (0003-9  [Batty, 
Sandy]  [Dillingham,  Tim]  [Galetto,  Jane  Morton]  [Goldsmith,  Amy]  [McNutt,  Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine] 
[O'Gorman,  Margaret]  [Schulte,  James]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  to  land  use  associated  with  the  proposed  land  exchange  and  the 
management  of  dredged  material  will  be  evaluated  in  EIS  Sections  4. 1,  5. 7,  and  7. 7. 

Comment:  The  Army  Corps  and  PSEG  must  consider  an  alternative  to  the  land  swap,  such  as 
using  the  existing  access  road  to  Artificial  Island  instead  of  creating  a  second  road,  if  and  when 
a  new  nuclear  facility  is  permitted.  This  would  avoid  destruction  of  wetlands  and  obviate  the 
need  for  a  new  dredge  disposal  site.  In  our  view,  the  existing  access  road  should  be  sufficient 
and  no  additional  destruction  of  wetlands  should  be  permitted  at  the  site.  Issues  associated 
with  a  new  spoil  disposal  site  are  as  yet  unknown  as  the  sites  under  consideration  are  unknown. 
But  there  are  likely  to  be  issues,  considering  the  Anny  [Army]  Corps'  preference  for  riverfront 
lands.  (0003-10  [Batty,  Sandy]  [Dillingham,  Tim]  [Galetto,  Jane  Morton]  [Goldsmith,  Amy]  [McNutt, 
Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [O'Gorman,  Margaret]  [Schulte,  James]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Impacts  to  land  use  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway  and  the  management 
of  dredged  material  will  be  evaluated  in  EIS  Sections  4. 7,  5. 1,  and  7. 7.  In  addition,  the  U.S. 
Army  Corps  of  Engineers-Philadelphia  District  will  consider  impacts  associated  with  the  land 
swapping  action  as  part  of  a  separate  environmental  review. 

D.2.5  Comments  Concerning  Land  Use — Transmission  Lines 

Comment:  There  are  two  Land  and  Water  Conservation  Fund  (LWCF)  sites  within  a  6-mile 
radius  of  the  proposed  project  located  in  Delaware.  It  does  not  appear  that  the  project  will 
directly  affect  the  Delaware  LWCF  sites.  However,  if  new  transmission  lines  were  to  cross  the 
river,  they  could  potentially  impact  these  LWCF  sites,  depending  upon  placement.  See  the 
attached  map  for  locations  of  the  LWCF  properties  within  the  6-mile  radius  of  the  proposal. 
(0017-1  [McConaghie,  Jennifer]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  to  off-site  land  use,  including  impacts  from  transmission  lines,  will 
be  evaluated  in  EIS  Sections  4. 7,  5. 7,  and  7. 7. 

Comment:  13)  Environmental  Report,  Chapter  5,  Page  5.6-1 

5.6.1  Terrestrial  Ecosystems 

The  ESP  states,  "Transmission  needs  for  the  new  plant  include  two  or  three  new  on-site 
transmissions  lines  crossing  between  two  proposed  switchyards  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  a 
potential  off-site  transmission  line."

D.2.6  Comments  Concerning  Geology 

Comment:  Much  of  the  needed  science  for  the  ESP  should  be  at  hand  since  the  new  station  is 
being  sited  adjacent  to  Hope  Creek  and  Salem  Creek  generation  stations;  their  track  record 
appears  to  be  good,  the  new  site  will  share  the  same  geology,  use  of  in  place  dredge  spoils 
constituting  all  soils  of  the  area-thus,  artificial  Island.  (0008-3  [Lacandro,  Roger]) 

Response:  The  geology  of  the  site  will  be  discussed  in  EIS  Section  2. 1 -Site  Location 
and  described  in  detail  in  EIS  Section  2.8-Geology. 

Comment:  And,  you  know,  that  is  also  why  it  is  a  very  bad  location.  Plus  the  facility  is  built  on 
mud.  It  is  river  mud  that  the  facility  is  built  on.  The  three  existing  facilities  have  pylons  that  go 
down,  like,  70  feet.  But  they  still  don't  hit  bedrock.  So  the  new  facility  will  probably  be  built  the 
same,  on  mud.  Mud  has  a  tendency  to  sink.  It  is  not  a  stable  foundation.  The  bedrock  is  much 
further  below.  They  just  stopped  trying  to  reach  bedrock.  Will  the  new  facility  be  based  in 
bedrock,  to  make  it  more  stable?  That  is  a  question  that  I  think  the  Commission  should  make 
part  of  their  review.  And  then,  also,  the  problem  with  mud,  and  building  a  facility  on  it,  is 
problem  with  earthquakes.  And  what  happens  is  if  you  have  buildings  on  a  soft  ground,  like 
mud,  you  get  liquefaction  -  that  is  the  term  that  is  used.  You  get  the  vibration  from  the 
earthquake.  The  earthquake  shaking  is  magnified,  by  the  mud,  which  shakes.  A  classic 
example  is  the  earthquake  in  Mexico  City,  about  10  or  15  years  ago.  It  was  a  mild  level,  Richter 
scale  event.  But  because  it  was  located  in  a  valley,  which  was  previously  marshland,  located 
on  mud,  the  whole  area  beneath  Mexico  City  vibrated.  So  the  effect  of  damage  was  amplified, 
even  greater.  You  have  this  same  situation,  there,  on  the  mud  at  Salem  Nuclear  Facility.  You 
know,  who  knows  when  an  earthquake  is  coming.  But  that,  also,  needs  to  be  evaluated.  So  I 
feel  it  is,  you  know,  one  of  the  worst  locations  for  an  existing  facility,  as  well  as  adding  a  new 
one.  (0002-6-7  [Schneider,  Richard])

D.2.7  Comments  Concerning  Hydrology — Surface  Water 

Comment:  (8)  ER  Section  4.1 .2.2,  page  4.1-7:  indicates  that  dredged  material  from  the 
USACE  Artificial  Island  CDF  and  from  dredging  activities  associated  with  the  intake  and  barge 
facility  areas  would  be  used  as  fill  material  on-site. 

At  a  May  9,  2010  meeting  with  the  NJDEP,  PSEG  representatives  indicated  that  dredging  of 
-975,000  cubic  yards  of  sediments  from  the  Delaware  River  would  be  needed  to  support  the 
project  -  this  has  apparently  been  reduced  to  ~  590,000  CY  (see  Comment  #9).  All  dredging 
and  dredged  material  management  activities  associated  with  the  construction  of  the  proposed 
project  must  be  described  and  comprehensively  evaluated.  This  would  include  testing  of 
dredged  material  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the  1997  NJDEP  Dredging  Technical 
Manual.  The  documents  submitted  in  support  of  the  ESPA  barely  discuss  dredging  and 
dredged  material  aspects  of  the  proposed  project.  Section  2.3.1  of  the  Environmental  Report 
only  briefly  summarizes  some  Delaware  River  sediment  samples  collected  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
project  site  and  subjected  only  to  grain  size  analyses. 

Dredging  and  dredged  material  management  activities  will  also  require  a  variety  of  permits  from 
the  NJDEP,  including  a  CZM  Consistency  Determination.  The  use  of  any  dredged  material  as 
on-site  fill  -  including  material  excavated  from  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  -  will 
require  an  Acceptable  Use  Determination  from  the  Department. 

At  the  May  9,  2010  meeting,  it  was  also  stated  that  construction  of  a  new  dredged  material 
upland  CDF  on  the  PSEG  property  may  be  needed.  If  still  needed,  the  potential  impacts  of  the 
construction  and  use  of  such  a  facility  must  also  be  comprehensively  evaluated  and  approved 
by  the  Department,  consistent  with  the  requirements  specified  in  the  1997  NJDEP  Dredging 
Technical  Manual.  (0020-10  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  to  surface-water  and  groundwater  quality  as  a  result  of 
construction,  including  dredging,  will  be  discussed  in  EIS  Sections  4.2.3.  i  Surface-Water- 
Quality  Impacts  and  4. 2. 3. 2  Groundwater-Quality  Impacts. 

Comment:  General  Comments 

The  permittee  included  various  estimates  of  projected  impingement  and  entrainment  values  for 
the  proposed  system.  Impingement  and  entrainment  can  be  assessed  by  a  wide  variety  of  tools 
and  it  is  not  possible  to  comment  on  the  accuracy  of  these  estimates  without  understanding 
more  regarding  the  underlying  assumptions.  However,  as  noted  above,  the  Department

Appendix  D 


supports  the  use  of  closed  cycle  cooling  as  best  technology  available  to  minimize  water 
withdrawal  rates. 

The  Department  recognizes  that  the  proposed  closed  cycle  cooling  system  using  cooling  towers 
and  a  low  intake  velocity  of  less  than  0.5  feet  per  second  constitutes  the  best  technology 
available  for  minimizing  impingement  and  entrainment  impacts  under  Section  316(b)  of  the 
Clean  Water  Act. 

Specific  Comments 

The  Department  takes  issue  with  the  following  statement  on  page  5.2-7: 

'"NJDEP  has  issued  a  discharge  permit  for  the  SGS  (reference  5.2-7)  and  determined  that  the 
SGSs  thermal  plume,  including  the  maximum  temperature,  does  not  impact  the  balanced

Rather,  the  Department  stated  the  following  in  its  June  29,  2001  NJPDES  permit  for  PSEG- 
Salem: 

"Therefore,  based  on  a  review  of  the  current  data  and  modeling  pertaining  to  the  thermal  plume 
as  well  as  the  biothermal  assessment,  the  Department  has  determined  that  a  variance  under 
Section  316(a)  is  warranted.  A  thermal  discharge  at  the  Station,  which  does  not  exceed  a 
maximum  of  1150  F  (46.10  C)  is  expected  to  assure  the  protection  and  propagation  of  the 
balanced  indigenous  population.  These  effluent  limitations  for  temperature  are  set  forth  in  Part 
lll-B/C  as  described  previously.  In  addition,  effluent  limitations  are  also  retained  for  heat  in  this 
proposed  renewal  permit  (applied  to  Units  1  and  2)." 

Specifically,  the  Department  did  not  include  a  statement  in  said  permit  that  PSEG  does  not 
impact  the  balanced  indigenous  community.  (0019-26  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Water  quality  and  aquatic  ecology  impacts  as  a  result  of  plant  operations  at  the 
proposed  units  will  be  discussed  in  Section  3.4.2. 7  -  Intakes,  Discharges ,  Cooling  Towers;  5.2.2 
-  Water  Use  Impacts;  Section  5.2.2. 7  -  Surface-Water  Impacts;  and  Section  5.3.2  -  Aquatic 
Impacts  Related  to  Operation. 

Comment:  The  Bureau  of  Water  Allocation  (BW  A)  has  reviewed  the  Environmental  Report 
(ER)  submitted  with  PSE&G  Early  Site  Permit  (ESP)  application  for  a  proposed  nuclear  electric 
generating  plant  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and 
Salem  Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2  (SGS)  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem 
County,  New  Jersey  (NJ). 

A  specific  reactor  technology  has  not  yet  been  selected.  However,  the  design  characteristics  of 
four  reactor  technologies  under  consideration  were  used  to  establish  a  plant  parameter 
envelope  (PPE)  (Site  Safety  Analysis  Report  [SSAR]  Section  1.3).  While  issuance  of  the  ESP 
does  not  authorize  construction  and  operation  of  any  new  nuclear  power  units,  this  ER  analyzes 
the  environmental  impacts  that  could  result  from  the  construction  and  operation  of  one  or  two 
new  nuclear  power  units  at  the  PSEG  site.  These  impacts  are  analyzed  to  determine  if  the  site

is  suitable  for  the  addition  of  the  new  nuclear  plant,  and  whether  there  is  an  alternative  site  that 
is  environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  site. 

PSEG  has  not  yet  selected  a  specific  reactor(s)  technology.  Four  different  technologies  are 
under  consideration  including: 

•  Advanced  Passive  1000  (API  000) 

•  U.S.  Evolutionary  Power  Reactor  (U.S.  EPR) 

•  Advanced  Boiling  Water  Reactor  (ABWR) 

•  U.S.  Advanced  Pressurized  Water  Reactor  (US-APWR) 

This  ESP  application  uses  a  PPE  approach  that  encompasses  all  four  reactor  technologies 
(SSAR  Section  1 .3).  The  ESP  analyzes  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  four  reactor 
technologies  using  either  one  unit  (U.S.  EPR,  ABWR,  or  U.S.  APWR)  or  two  units  (AP  1000)  at 
the  PSEG  site.  Since  a  specific  reactor  technology  has  not  been  selected,  the  environmental 
impact  analyses  are  based  on  reactor  bounding  conditions  derived  from  detailed  reactor 
information  supplied  by  the  vendors.  The  total  bounding  PPE  value  for  the  new  plant  is 
6830  gross  megawatts  thermal  (MWt)  (SSAR  Table  1.3-1  Item  17.3)  and  2200  MWe  net. 

Section  3.2,  Reactor  Power  Conversion  System,  provides  additional  information  on  these 
reactor  technologies. 

The  new  plant  uses  a  recirculating  (closed-cycle)  cooling  water  system  that  includes  natural 
draft,  mechanical,  or  fan-assisted  natural  draft  cooling  towers.  A  new  shoreline  intake  structure 
supplies  makeup  water  from  the  Delaware  River  to  the  new  plant.  A  new  discharge  structure 
conveys  cooling  tower  blowdown  to  the  Delaware  River  in  conformance  with  New  Jersey 
Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System  (NJPDES)  permit  requirements. 

Section  3.4,  Cooling  System,  provides  additional  detail  on  the  intake,  discharge,  and  cooling 
tower  components  of  the  plant  cooling  system. 

In  accordance  with  Water  Supply  Management  Act,  N.J.S.A.  58:1  A-l  et  seq.  and  its  supporting 
regulations  N.J.A.C.  7:19-1  et  seq.  the  following  will  be  required  from  BWA: 

A  Water  Allocation  Temporary  Dewatering  Permit  will  be  required  for  construction  dewatering 
where  the  dewatering  rate  is  100,000  gallons  per  day  for  more  than  30  days  in  a  consecutive 
365day  period.  If  the  dewatering  period  is  30  days  or  less,  a  Permit  by  Rule  will  suffice.  A 
Dewatering  Permit  by  Rule  may  be  applicable  if  the  dewatering  occurs  from  within  a  coffer  dam. 

The  current  Water  Allocation  Permit,  No.  221 6P  requires  modification  to  allow  additional  ground 
water  use  for  the  new  plant.  Included  with  such  a  request  for  major  modification  of  the  Water 
Allocation  Permit  will  be  a  Hydrogeologic  Report  prepared  in  accordance  with  GSR-29 
Guidelines  pursuant  to  N.J.A.C.  7:19-22(c). 

The  site  is  located  in  the  Salem/Gloucester  County  USGS  Study  Area  south  of  Critical  Area 
No. 2.  Increases  in  withdrawals  from  the  PRM  Aquifer  are  being  reviewed  by  BWA  due  to 
concerns  with  safe  yield  and  salt  water  intrusion.  The  results  of  t  (0019-24  [Brubaker,  Scott])

Response:  The  EIS  will  identify  and  in  some  instances  discuss  all  the  appropriate  Federal, 
state,  and  local  authorizations  and  consultations  an  applicant  must  obtain  before  construction 
and  operation  can  take  place.  These  permits  and  approvals  will  be  will  be  discuss  in  Chapter  1 
and  Appendix  H  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Increases  in  turbidity  through  the  resuspension  of  sediments  into  the  water  column 
from  dredging  and  port  operations  will  degrade  water  quality,  lower  dissolved  oxygen  levels,  and 
potentially  release  chemical  contaminants  bound  to  the  fine-grained  estuarine/marine 
sediments.  Sedimentation  and  wave  patterns  in  the  area  may  be  altered  as  a  result  of  vessels 
entering  and  exiting  the  proposed  mooring  area  also  resulting  in  increased  turbidity.  Suspended 
sediments  mask  pheromones  used  by  migratory  fishes,  and  can  smother  immobile  benthic 
organisms  and  demersal  newly-  settle  juvenile  fish  (Auld  and  Schubel  1978;  Breitburg  1988; 
Newcombe  and  MacDonald  1991;  Burton  1993;  Nelson  and  Wheeler  1997).  As  supported 
above,  the  project  area  provides  important  habitat  for  striped  bass  including  valuable  spawning 
grounds  and  nursery  habitat.  Increases  in  turbidity  will  adversely  affect  striped  bass  larvae's 
ability  to  capture  prey  (Fay  et  al.  1983  in  Able  and  Fahay  1998).  The  decrease  in  water 
circulation  can  also  adversely  affect  striped  bass  survival  as  strong  current  is  needed  to  keep 
the  eggs  suspended  in  the  water  column  and  prevent  them  from  being  smothered  by  silt 
(Bigelow  and  Schroeder  1953).  (0022-3  [Gorski,  Stanley]) 

Response:  Potential  construction  impacts  as  a  result  of  dredging  including  lowered  dissolved 
oxygen  levels,  potential  releases  of  chemical  contaminants  bound  to  fine-  grained  sediment, 
and  suspended  sediments  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.2,  4.2.3.  T  and  4.2. 4  of  the  EIS. 
Impacts  to  aquatic  fauna  will  be  discussed  in  Section  4.3.2 

Comment:  Impacts  to  the  quality  of  surface  waters  and  the  alteration  of  river  bottom  sediments 
within  the  Delaware  River  and  adjacent  marsh  creeks  are  expected  as  a  result  of  the 
construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  facility,  and  will  include  those  associated  with  the 
development  of  shoreline  features  (intake  structure,  barge  facility,  heavy  haul  road),  dredging  of 
sediments  from  the  near-shore  area  of  the  Delaware  River  to  provide  for  water  intake  and 
discharge  and  to  provide  adequate  draft  for  barge  access  during  construction,  and  the  filling  of 
9.5  acres  of  coastal  tidal  wetlands  and  shallow  open  water  areas.  (0022-1  [Gorski,  Stanley])

Comment:  (9)  ER,  Section  4. 2. 1.1. 4,  page  4.2-5:  briefly  describes  construction  and  dredging 
activities  along  the  Delaware  River  shoreline.  A  total  area  of  92  acres  -  approximately 
590,000  CY  of  sediment  -  is  proposed  to  be  dredged.  The  document  concludes  that  impacts 
associated  with  dredging  are  small.  However,  much  more  work  is  needed  to  comprehensively 
evaluate  the  potential  impacts  resulting  from  dredging  and  dredged  material  management 
activities  -  see  Comment  #8.  (0020-13  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  to  surface-water  quality  as  a  result  of  construction  and  operation, 
including  dredging,  will  be  discussed  in  EIS  Sections  4.2.4,  4.3. 7,  5.2.  i,  and  5.2.1.  In  addition, 
cumulative  impacts  to  surface-water  use  will  be  discussed  in  Section  7. 2. 1.1. 

Comment:  The  ER  acknowledges  that  hydrogeological  impacts  will  result  from  dredging  near¬ 
shore  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  for  water  intake,  water  discharge,  and  barge  access  areas 
(modifying  the  existing  HCGS  barge  slip.)  DRN  has  long  advocated  for  comprehensive 
environmental  review  of  dredging  projects  that  will  result  in  significant  harm  to  the  Delaware 
River's  environmental  values  through  dredging  and  filling,  blasting,  and  degraded  water  quality. 
Section  4.2.1 .1 .4  of  PSEG's  ER  describes  the  proposed  dredging  as  follows: 

"Alteration  of  surface  waters  within  the  Delaware  River  include  those  associated  with  the 
development  of  shoreline  features  (intake  structure,  barge  facility,  heavy  haul  road),  and 
dredging  (Figure  3.1-2).  Constructed  features  along  the  Delaware  River  shoreline  require  the 
filling  of  9.5  ac.  of  coastal  wetlands  and  shallow  open  water  areas  (Subsection  4. 3. 2. 3). 
Construction  of  these  facilities  includes  the  installation  of  sheet  piling,  bulkheads,  and  backfilling 
to  create  the  constructed  project  utilization  area.  Shorelines  will  be  stabilized  and  protected 
from  erosion  by  the  use  of  hardened  bank  applications  (concrete,  riprap,  etc.).  Consequently,  in 
consideration  of  the  small  area  of  river  to  be  modified  relative  to  the  size  of  the  Delaware  River, 
and  based  on  the  use  of  hardened  bank  treatments  that  minimize  shoreline  erosion,  potential 
construction  related  impacts  to  the  Delaware  River  are  SMALL,  but  warrant  mitigation  in 
accordance  with  the  NJDEP  and  USACE  requirements. 

Sediments  from  the  near-shore  area  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  will  be  dredged  to  provide 
for  water  intake  and  discharge  and  to  provide  adequate  draft  for  barge  access  during 
construction.  Construction  of  the  new  barge  unloading  facility  and  mooring  area  will  require 
lowering  of  the  river  bottom  an  average  of  4.5  ft.  over  an  area  of  61  ac.  (dredging  of 
440,000  cubic  yards  of  sediment).  Barge  mooring  caissons  will  be  constructed.  Each  caisson 
is  20  ft.  in  diameter  resulting  in  the  loss  of  0.05  ac.  of  river  bottom  habitat  for  seven  caissons. 
Construction  of  the  new  intake  structure  requires  lowering  the  river  bottom  an  average  of  4.5  ft. 
over  an  area  of  31  -ac.  (dredging  of  1 50,000  cubic  yards  of  sediment). 

The  total  area  to  be  dredged  is  92  ac.,  extending  riverward  1700  ft.  from  the  shoreline,  or  13 
percent  of  the  2.5-mi.  river  width  at  this  location.  Dredging  may  include  both  mechanical  and 
hydraulic  dredging  methods.  Dredged  material  removed  as  part  of  this  construction  activity  will 
be  transported  to  and  placed  in  an  on-site  or  other  approved  upland  disposal  facility.  The 
potential  impacts  of  the  dredging  activities  on  water  quality  are  described  in  Subsection  4.2.3. 1 . 

Potential  impacts  to  benthic  organisms  are  discussed  in  Section  4.3.  BMPs  for  dredging 
implemented  during  this  activity  will  comply  with  requirements  of  the  USACE  Section  1 0/404 


NUREG-2168

and  NJDEP  permits.  Hydrologic  alterations  associated  with  this  activity  include  localized 
changes  in  flow  patterns  along  the  river  bottom  due  to  differences  in  bottom  contours  at  the 
edges  of  the  dredge  zone.  From  a  river  flow  cross  section  perspective,  the  dredged  area  for 
barge  access  would  add  a  total  of  7500  square  feet  (sq.  ft.)  to  an  existing  cross  section  of 
220,000  sq.  ft.  (low  water)  to  270,000  sq.  ft.  (high  water),  or  a  localized  increase  in  flow  area 
that  is  in  the  range  of  2.5  to  3.5  percent.  Accordingly,  the  average  velocity  within  the  dredged 
area  is  reduced  in  proportion  to  the  increase  in  cross  sectional  area.  However,  these  small 
scale  alterations  in  river  flow  are  minimal  in  the  context  of  the  large  size  of  the  Delaware  River 
and  regular  tidal  flows.  In  consideration  of  the  magnitude  of  the  tidal  flow  and  the  size  of  the 
Delaware  River,  potential  impacts  associated  with  dredging  are  SMALL." 

Clearly,  the  EIS  will  need  to  address  the  impact  of  dredging  and  related  shoreline  disturbance 
and  take  all  viable  alternatives  into  account.  (0018-9  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  to  surface-water  quality  as  a  result  of  construction  and  operation, 
including  dredging,  will  be  discussed  in  EIS  Sections  4.2.4,  4.3. 1,  5.2. 1,  and  5.2.1.  In  addition, 
cumulative  impacts  to  surface-water  use  will  be  discussed  in  Section  7. 2. 1.1.  The  part  of  the 
comment  dealing  with  land  use  and  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  will  be  discussed  in 
Sections  4.1.1  and  4.3.1. 1,  respectively.  Finally,  potential  impacts  to  aquatic  organisms  as  a 
result  of  construction  and  operation  can  be  in  Section  4.3.2  and  5.3.2. 

Comment:  Therefore,  DRN  urges  NRC  to  review  certain  issues  in  more  detail,  including: 
clearer  evaluation  of  PSEG's  use  of  the  Army  Corps  confined  disposal  facility,  and  cumulative 
impacts  resulting  from  use  of  that  site;  water  impacts  including  dredging  and  construction 
impacts;  filling  of  wetlands;  floodplain  impacts;  habitat  impacts  and  impacts  to  species, 
especially  Atlantic  sturgeon;  and  impacts  and  evaluation  of  alternatives  for  cooling  systems. 
(0018-2  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers-Philadelphia  District  is  a  Cooperating  Agency 
on  the  EIS  for  PSEG's  ESP  application.  As  such,  the  environmental  impacts  of  any  actions 
proposed  by  the  Corps  to  facilitate  PSEG's  ESP  application,  including  the  land  exchange  and 
relocation  of  the  confined  disposal  facility,  will  be  discussed  in  the  EIS.  Impacts  as  a  result  of 

construction  including  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  and  habitat  can  be  found  in  Chapter  4. 
Finally,  potential  cumulative  impacts  as  noted  in  the  comment  will  be  evaluated  in  Chapter  7  of 
the  EIS. 

Comment:  Finally,  NRC  must  evaluate  the  impacts  and  all  viable  alternatives  for  cooling.  DRN 
notes  that  EPA’s  Phase  I  regulations  for  new  sources  require  closed-cycle  cooling,  which  the 
new  plant  will  have.  68  Fed.  Reg.  36749-36755  (June  19,  2003).  DRN  has  long  advocated  for 
closed-cycle  cooling  at  the  existing  Salem  facility.  However,  that  does  not  mean  that  closed- 
cycle  cooling  is  without  impacts,  or  that  one  size  fits  all  when  selecting  the  specific  cooling 
technology.  According  to  the  ER  "Compared  with  a  once-  through  cooling  system,  a  closed 
cycle  cooling  system  substantially  reduces  the  volume  of  water  diverted  for  cooling  but 
increases  consumptive  water  use  as  a  result  of  evaporation  loss  in  the  cooling  tower.”  (0018-15

Response:  Consumptive  water  use  potential  operational  impacts  will  be  discussed  in 
Sections  5.2  and  7.2  of  the  EIS.  Ecological  impacts  as  result  of  plant  operation  will  be 
discussed  in  Section  5.3.2.  Potential  thermal  impacts,  including  to  water  chemistry,  will  be 
discussed  in  Section  5.2.4.  Alternative  cooling  system  designs  will  be  discussed  in  Chapter  9. 

Comment:  In  addition  to  the  steps  being  taken  to  protect  the  wetlands  impacted  by 
construction,  the  aquatic  impacts  of  the  proposed  facility  will  be  limited  by  the  use  of  a  closed 
cycle  cooling  system.  Compared  to  a  once-through  system,  these  cooling  towers  will  divert 
much  less  water  for  cooling.  Projected  maximum  diversion  for  the  new  facility  is  less  than  4%  of 
the  current  amount  used  by  the  Salem  Generating  Station  and  is  a  very  small  fraction  the  total 
volume  of  the  Delaware  River  flow.  As  a  result,  impingement  of  fish  populations  will  be  a  small 
fraction-less  than  3%  of  the  current  level  of  the  Salem  station. 

Because  of  the  closed  cooling  system,  we  would  also  expect  the  thermal  plume  of  the  new  plant 
to  be  localized  and  relatively  small,  with  no  significant  impact  on  the  local  aquatic  biota.  The 
conclusion  is  based  on  past  studies  of  the  impact  of  thermal  plumes  from  the  existing  PSEG 
generating  plants,  the  expected  operation  of  the  proposed  cooling  structures,  and  our 
understanding  of  the  ecology  of  aquatic  species  in  the  vicinity  of  the  plant.  (0014-1 1  [Velinsky, 
David]) 

Response:  Consumptive  water  use  potential  operational  impacts  will  be  discussed  in 
Sections  5.2  and  7.2  of  the  EIS.  Ecological  impacts  as  result  of  plant  operation  will  be 
discussed  in  Section  5.3.2.  Potential  thermal  impacts  will  be  discussed  in  Section  5.2.4. 

Comment:  WRA  is  interested  in  PSEG's  proposed  project  because  PSEG's  proposed  nuclear 
plant  will  be  a  major  water  user  located  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  and  is  an  important  part  of 
the  economy  of  New  Jersey  and  the  region  at  large.  (0011-1  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Response:  Consumptive  water  use  potential  operational  impacts  will  be  discussed  in 
Sections  5.2  and  7.2  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Consumptive  water  use  is  an  important  issue  on  the  Delaware  River  Basin, 
especially  during  drought  periods.  Although  the  proposed  plant  is  located  in  the  saline  estuary, 
fresh  water  will  still  be  evaporated  by  the  cooling  towers  and  thereby  consumed.  During 
declared  drought  emergencies  the  fresh  water  consumed  should  be  replaced  at  an  appropriate 
ratio  by  using  water  released  from  the  Merrill  Creek  Reservoir  near  Phillipsburg,  NJ.  PSEG, 
along  with  several  other  electric  generation  companies,  is  a  co-  owner  of  Merrill  Creek.  Water 
released  from  Merrill  Creek  helps  in  keeping  the  salt  line  from  moving  upstream  to  the  water 
intakes  for  the  City  of  Philadelphia.  Merrill  Creek  was  financed,  built  and  operated  by  electric 
generating  companies  for  just  this  purpose.  (0011-10  [Molzahn,  Robert])

Water  release  from  Merril  Creek  helps  in  keeping  the  salt  line,  which  is  a  250  isoclore  line  from 
moving  upstream  to  the  water  intakes  for  the  City  of  Philadelphia.  Merrill  Creek  was  financed, 
built  and  operated  by  electric  generating  companies  for  just  this  purpose.  (0001-8-9  [Molzahn,

Comment:  In  reviewing  the  PSEG  Early  Site  Permit  application,  and  Environmental  Report 
filed  on  May  25th,  2010,  we  noted  that  the  new  units  intake  and  cooling  systems  will  be 
designed  to  minimize  the  impact  to  the  aquatic  community,  by  utilizing  cooling  towers,  and  an 
intake  system  and  design  flows  that  conform  to  best  available  technology  as  required  under 
Section  31 6B  of  the  Clean  Water  Act.  The  cooling  tower  blow-down  discharge  should  have  little 
impact  on  the  Delaware  River,  at  this  location,  or  significantly  elevate  river  water  temperatures. 
(0001-8-8  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Response:  Consumptive  water  use  potential  operational  impacts  will  be  discussed  in 
Sections  5.2  and  7.2  of  the  EIS.  Potential  thermal  impacts  will  be  discussed  in  Section  5.2.4. 
Additionally,  mitigative  measures  proposed  by  the  applicant,  if  needed  will  be  identified  in  the 
section  titled  Potential  Mitigation  Measures  for  Operation-Related  Water  Impacts. 

Comment:  With  the  new  facility  a  good  thing  is,  if  it  is  built,  that  it  would  have  a  closed  loop 
cooling  system,  which  would  greatly  reduce  the  amount  of  water  needed  to  cool  the  facility.  A 
closed  loop  cooling  system  reduces  the  water  take,  compared  to  an  open  loop  system,  by  90  to 
95  percent.  So  however,  an  average  nuclear  facility  draws  in,  an  open  loop  system,  like  a  billion 
gallons  of  water  a  day,  over  a  billion.  So  even  with  the  closed  loop,  you  are  still  talking  about 
50  million  to  100  million  of  gallons  a  day.  (0002-6-9  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Response:  Consumptive  water  use  potential  operational  impacts  will  be  discussed  in 
Sections  5.2  and  7.2  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  In  addition  to  the  steps  being  taken  to  protect  wetlands  impacted  by  the 
construction,  the  aquatic  impacts  of  the  proposed  facility  will  be  limited  by  the  use  of  a  closed- 
cycle  cooling  system.  Compared  to  the  once  through  system,  these  cooling  towers  will  divert 
much  less  water  for  cooling.  Projected  maximum  diversion,  for  the  new  facility,  is  less  than 
four  percent,  depending  on  the  type  of  facility  of  the  current  use  by  Salem,  and  is  less  than 
.05  percent  of  the  total  volume  of  the  Delaware  flow.  (0001-4-7  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  Wetland  protection  during  construction  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.2.1  - 
Hydrological  Alterations,  4.2.5  -  Potential  Mitigation  Measures  for  Construction-Related  Water 
Impacts,  and  4.3.1  -  Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Impacts.  Consumptive  water  use  for  plant 
operational  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  5.2  and  7.2  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Finally,  although  this  does  not  relate  directly  to  the  environmental  impacts  of  the 
new  plant,  I  would  add  these  thoughts  on  the  prospects  of  global  climate  change.  As  an 
environmental  scientist,  I  believe  it  is  no  exaggeration  to  say  that  climate  change  represents  the 
singular  environmental  threat  of  the  coming  century.  Even  for  the  development  of  the  new 
plant,  the  reality  of  sea  level  rise  is  a  factor  that  must  be  and  is  being  taken  into  account.  (0014-

Response:  Environmental  impacts  resulting  from  construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed 
plant,  including  greenhouse  gas  emissions  will  be  addressed  in  the  EIS  Chapters  4,  5,  and  7. 
Greenhouse  gas  emissions  associated  with  the  fuel  cycle  will  be  presented  in  Chapter  6. 
Potential  impacts  of  flooding  and  sea  level  rise  will  be  evaluated  in  the  safety  evaluation  report. 

Comment:  Sea  level  rise  and  storm  surge  are  also  a  concern  at  the  proposed  facility.  Critical 
structures  should  be  elevated  or  waterproofed  at  an  appropriate  elevation  to  ensure  their 
protection.  The  NRC  should  review  these  design  plans  to  confirm  they  are  protective  for  sea 
level  rise.  (0011-14  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  My  questions  would  include:  concern  for  extreme  floods  and  adequate  entrance 
and  egress  systems,  maintaining  a  good,  continuous  dialog  with  the  community  and  an 
insistence  that  only  the  best  science  be  incorporated  in  planning  and  construction.  (0008-8 
[Lacandro,  Roger]) 

Comment:  The  proposed  construction  of  Salem  4  on  Artificial  Island  would  have  several 
significant  environmental  impacts  that  the  Corps  must  consider,  including,  but  not  limited  to: 

•  Increasing  level  of  flooding  will  take  place  on  the  island  in  the  coming  50  and  1 00  year  time 
frames.  The  impact  of  sea  level  rise  must  be  considered.  Development  of  an  additional 
nuclear  plant  puts  the  facility,  the  workers,  and  the  nuclear  materials  to  be  stored  on  the  site 
at  risk  of  harm  and,  in  the  case  of  the  nuclear  materials,  at  risk  of  release  into  the  River  and 
environment.  (0003-2  [Batty,  Sandy]  [Dillingham,  Tim]  [Galetto,  Jane  Morton]  [Goldsmith,  Amy] 
[McNutt,  Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [O'Gorman,  Margaret]  [Schulte,  James]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  other  potential  impact  that  has  to  be  considered  here  is  associated  with  sea 
level  rise.  This  is  occurring,  it  is  not  disputed.  Certainly  in  areas  of  New  Jersey  this  is  expected 
to  be  greater  than  in  other  areas  of  the  country.  This  is  not  a  game  stopper  here.  One  of  the 
things  I  do  at  Rutgers  is  work  with  coastal  communities  on  developing  adaptation  strategies  to 
sea  level  rise.  And  I'm  confident  that  the  new  facility  will  factor  into  account  strategies  to  deal 
with  a  rising  sea  level  along  the  New  Jersey  coast.  (0002-4-4  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Comment:  My  questions  would  include  concern  for  extreme  floods,  which  may  be  different  now 
than  when  the  original  plants  were  put  into  existence,  adequate  entrance  and  egress  systems, 
maintaining  a  good,  continuous  dialogue  with  the  community.  (0001-9-7  [Lacandro,  Roger]) 

Comment:  Sea  level  rise  and  storm  surge  are  also  a  concern  of  the  proposed  facility,  critical 
structures  should  be  elevated,  or  waterproofed,  at  an  appropriate  elevation  to  ensure  their 
protection.  The  NRC  should  review  these  design  plans  to  conform  that  they  are  protected  for 
sea  level  rise.  (0001-8-13  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  The  proposed  construction  of  Salem  4  on  Artificial  Island  would  have  several 
significant  and  environmental  impacts  that  the  Corps  must  consider  including,  but  not  limited  to, 
increased  level  of  flooding,  that  will  take  place  on  the  island  in  the  coming  50  and  100  year  time 
frame.  The  impact  of  sea  level  rise  must  be  considered.  Development  of  an  additional  nuclear 
plant  puts  the  facility,  the  workers,  and  the  nuclear  materials  to  be  stored  on  this  site,  at  risk  of 
harm.  And  in  the  case  of  nuclear  materials,  at  risk  of  release  into  the  river,  and  environment.

D.2.8  Comments  Concerning  Hydrology — Groundwater 

Comment:  As  it  relates  to  the  ESP  and  proposed  additional  unit  at  Hope  Creek,  how  does  the 
trend  of  declining  water  levels  in  the  upper  PRM  affect  the  potential  water  use  with  the  proposed 
new  unit?  Will  there  need  to  be  deeper  wells  in  the  mid-levels  of  the  PRM?  (0021-2  [Brubaker, 
Scott]) 

Response:  Water  withdrawal  and  impacts  on  the  aquifer  will  be  evaluated  in  EIS  Sections 
4.2.2-  Water-  Use  Impacts  and  5. 2. 2. 2-  Groundwater-  Use  Impacts.  The  cumulative  impact  of  site 
groundwater  use  combined  with  the  impacts  of  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable 
future  actions  affecting  groundwater  resources  will  be  discussed  in  Section  7. 2 -Water  Use  and 
Quality. 

Comment:  ER  Page  12  of  42,  Section  6  -Environmental  Measurements  and  Monitoring 
Programs 

6.2.2. 1  Radiological  Monitoring  Program 

"The  existing  PSEG  REMP  serves  as  the  new  plant  construction/preoperational  radiological 
monitoring  program.  Additional  on-site  thermoluminescent  dosimetry  (TLD)  monitoring  locations 
will  be  added  to  the  north  of  the  HCGS  to  support  the  ODCM/REMP  for  the  construction  and 
preoperational  period.  A  description  of  the  new  monitoring  locations  and  other  applicable 
parameters  will  be  provided  in  the  combined  license  (COL)  application." 

Comment:  The  NJBNE  requests  that  the  licensee  establish  a  Groundwater  Protection  Program 
for  the  proposed  site  at  the  construction/pre-operational  stage  rather  than  waiting  for  the 
operation  of  the  facility.  During  the  construction  phase,  there  will  be  knowledge  as  to  where  all 
applicable  tanks  and  pipes  are  going  to  be  located,  along  with  buildings  containing  radioactive 
fluids  and  areas  of  further  investigation  for  potential  tritium  in  groundwater.  (0019-7  [Brubaker, 
Scott]) 

Response:  Potential  operational  impacts  to  groundwater  quality  and  water  monitoring  will  be 
discussed  in  EIS  Sections  5.2.3.2-Groundwater-Quality  Impacts  and  5. 2. 4 -Water  Monitoring. 
Specific  details  of  PSEG 's  radiological  environmental  monitoring  program  (REMP)  will  be 
presented  in  EIS  Section  5. 9. 6-Radiological  Monitoring.  As  required  by  an  NRC  licensing 
condition,  the  existing  REMP  program  for  the  currently  operating  Salem  and  Elope  Creek  units 
will  be  updated  by  the  applicant  to  include  specific  details  related  to  monitoring  of  the  proposed 
unit.  Per  agreement  with  the  NRC,  this  program  includes  monitoring  of  groundwater,  is  updated 
once  necessary  facility  design  details  are  available,  and  must  be  evaluated  and  approved  by  the 
NRC  prior  to  the  operation  of  the  facility.  The  REMP  program  is  evaluated  by  NRC  staff  as  part 
of  the  safety  review  process  to  ensure  that  it  is  adequate  to  monitor  each  onsite  unit,  identify 
potential  contamination,  and  prevent  offsite  impacts.

Comment:  The  NJBNE  is  requesting  split  samples  from  any  new  groundwater  monitoring  wells 
installed  in  association  with  the  new  facility.  The  sampling  of  these  new  wells  should  be  added 
to  the  existing  licensee  sampling  plan  and  Groundwater  Protection  Program  (GWPP).  In 
addition,  a  one-time  composite  soil  core  boring  sample  from  any  new  well  is  requested  by  the 
NJBNE.  Initial  sampling  provides  a  baseline  history  prior  to  plant  operation.  (0019-1  [Brubaker,

Response:  Potential  impacts  to  groundwater  as  a  result  of  construction  and  operation  of  the 
proposed  plant  will  be  evaluated  in  EIS  Sections  4. 2. 4-Water  Monitoring,  5.2.4-  Water 
Monitoring  and  7.2.2  Cumulative  Groundwater-Quality  Impacts.  The  State  of  New  Jersey  would 
be  responsible  for  requiring  that  the  applicant  provide  any  type  of  groundwater  monitoring 
program  samples.  Such  activities  are  not  within  the  NRC's  licensing  authority. 

D.2.9  Comments  Concerning  Ecology — Terrestrial 

Comment:  During  the  re-permitting  of  the  existing  nuclear  facilities  at  Salem,  PSEG  developed 
a  bay-wide  concept  of  mitigating  the  impacts  of  the  existing  cooler  apparatus  at  those  facilities. 
They  were  creative  in  identifying  a  variety  of  ways  that  the  bay-wide  resource  value  could  be 
improved  through  investment  in  projects,  throughout  the  Delaware  Bay  Estuary.  I  was  attracted 
by  the  scope  of  their  thinking,  and  the  resources  they  could  bring  to  the  table.  I  testified  in  favor 
of  this  mitigation  idea  at  the  repermitting  hearing.  (0001-10-4  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  ecological  impact  mitigation,  as 
necessary,  in  Section  5.3  of  the  EIS.  The  EIS  will  also  include  a  discussion  of  the  bay-  wide 
approach  undertaken  by  PSEG  as  part  of  the  existing  environment. 

Comment:  Since  then  I  have  followed,  with  my  students,  and  with  great  interest,  what  has 
become  the  largest  estuarine  enhancement  project  in  the  world.  Without  going  into  any  details, 
the  project  has  been,  in  my  mind,  a  resounding  success  at  many  levels,  in  increasing  the 
resource  value  of  large  acreages  throughout  the  bay.  PSEG  has  a  solid  track  record  in 
delivering  on  their  commitment  to  bay-wide  health.  (0001-10-6  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  PSEG's  estuarine  enhancement 
program  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  existing  environment. 

Comment:  Returning,  finally,  to  the  purpose  of  this  hearing,  should  this  project  move  forward 
with  construction,  there  will  be  on-site  habitat  impacts  that  will  be  unavoidable.  I  urge  the 


NUREG-2168 


D-36

Appendix  D 


process  to  embrace  the  same  bay-wide  approach  used  in  the  estuarine  enhancement  program, 
and  to  be  creative  and  aggressive,  in  identifying  off-site  mitigation  opportunity.  Hold  PSEG's 
feet  to  the  fire.  History  suggests  that  they  will  deliver.  (0001-10-8  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  on-site  habitat  impacts  in  Sections  4. 3  and  5.3  of  the 
EIS.  Potential  off -site  mitigation  measures  will  be  discussed,  as  necessary,  in  Section  4.3  of  the 
EIS.  A  bay-wide  approach  will  be  similarly  emphasized  over  a  site-  specific  evaluation  that  can 
overlook  the  benefits  of  an  overall  ecosystem  approach. 

Comment:  With  respect  to  restoration  of  wetlands,  it  has  been  common  knowledge,  for  a  long 
time,  that  wetlands  support  the  production  of  most  commercial  and  recreational  fin  fish  and 
shellfish  species,  that  we  all  enjoy  eating,  or  capturing,  or  both.  To  the  extent  that  you  can  find 
citations  in  the  literature,  Irand  and  Lacy,  for  example,  that  say  95  percent  of  all  commercial  and 
recreational  species  produced,  marine  species  produced  in  the  United  States,  require  wetlands 
as  essential  habitats  during  their  first  year  of  life.  (0001-14-1  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  describe  the  existing  wetlands  that  could  be  affected  in  Section 
2.4  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  The  company  had  the  foresight,  long  before  the  Estuarine  Restoration  Act  was 
passed,  with  the  goal  of  restoring  a  million  estuarine  acres,  including  many  wetlands,  in  the  U.S. 
by  the  year  2010.  Long  before  that  Act  was  passed,  and  the  guardian  of  that  act  became  two 
entities,  essentially,  Restore  America's  Estuaries,  a  practitioner  coalition  nation-wide.  Actually 
now  world-wide.  And  the  Community  Restoration  Center,  NOAA  Restoration  Center, 

Community  Based  Restoration  Center  which  has,  I  think,  a  collective  budget,  over  the  years, 
now  exceeding  28  million  dollars.  Before  that  became  in  the  public  venue,  and  popular, 
restoring  wetlands  is  a  good  thing,  and  we  needed  to  know  why,  of  course. 

Long  before  that  became  the  popular  trend,  the  company  PSEG  had  been  developing  this 
program  as  a  cost-effective  basis  for  offsetting  the  effects  of  the  power  plant,  with  respect  to  its 
take  of  fin  fish  and  shellfish.  And  the  goal  was  to  produce  enough  wetland  acreage,  or  to 
conserve  and  restore  enough  wetland  acreage,  to  produce  the  number  of  equivalent  adults  that 
would  be  lost  at  the  facility.  (0001-14-3  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  PSEG's  wetland  conservation  and 
restoration  efforts  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  existing  environment. 

Comment:  We  have  been  able  to  demonstrate,  given  the  extreme  variability  around  any  mean 
you  calculate,  in  these  sites,  in  terms  of  processes  and  functions,  that  the  20  plus  thousand 
acres  produced  a  new  increment  of  secondary  production  of  these  fin  fish  and  shellfish  that 
exceeded  the  loss,  again  as  I  said  before,  of  equivalent  adults.  Also  we  have  been  able  to 
document,  everybody  says  phragmites  is  bad,  and  we  suspected  for  a  long  time  that  it  had  to  do 
with  habitat,  and  other  functional  processes. 

Some  of  our  research  has  now  demonstrated  that  a  fish  growing  up  in  a  phragmites  dominated 
marsh,  whatever  the  combination  of  factors  is,  and  I  should  say  to  you,  much  to  the  company's

chagrin,  I  was  able  with  my  colleagues  to  demonstrate  that  carbon  nitrogen  nutrients  from 
phragmites  is,  indeed,  finding  its  way  into  this  fish. 

But  the  quality  of  the  animal,  the  end  of  the  growing  season,  falls  short  of  the  quality  of  an 
animal  in  a  naturally  cord  grass  dominated  marsh.  In  other  words,  they  can't  put  down  the 
energy  reserves,  for  migration  and  overwintering,  if  they  grow  up  in  a  phragmites  marsh. 
(0001-14-6  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  describe  the  existing  wetlands  that  could  be 
affected  in  Section  2. 4  of  the  EIS.  Mitigation  with  native  plant  species,  as  necessary,  and 
control  of  invasive  species  (i.e.,  phragmites)  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the 
EIS.

But  the  quality  of  the  animal,  the  end  of  the  growing  season,  falls  short  of  the  quality  of  an 
animal  in  a  naturally  cord  grass  dominated  marsh.  In  other  words,  they  can't  put  down  the 
energy  reserves,  for  migration  and  overwintering,  if  they  grow  up  in  a  phragmites  marsh.

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  describe  the  existing  wetlands  that  could  be 
affected  in  Section  2. 4  of  the  EIS.  Mitigation  with  native  plant  species,  as  necessary,  and 
control  of  invasive  species  (i.e.,  phragmites)  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the 
EIS. 

Comment:  So  let  me  close  with  a  series  of  statistics,  if  I  may.  First  of  all,  as  Seagrant  Director, 

I  was  able  to  enter  into  a  public  private  partnership  with  the  company.  The  company  put  up 
750,000  dollars  over  five  years,  and  we  Seagrant  Directors,  in  1 1  states  around  the  nation, 
matched  those  funds,  to  do  some  of  the  basic  and  applied  research  to  understand  what  was 
going  on,  as  we  were  restoring  these  sites. 

One  of  those  projects  funded  a  young  lady  by  the  name  of  Kristen  Solenstal  at  Yale  University. 
She  was  the  first  of  many  people  trying,  with  that  funding,  to  demonstrate  that  the  variety  of 
phragmites  that  we  call  bad  is  actually  an  introduced  variety,  probably  from  either  Asia,  or 
Europe,  or  probably  both. 

That  was  part  of  this  Marsh  Ecology  Research  Program,  or  the  MERP,  as  we  called  it.  All  of 
these  funds  were  parlayed  into  many  federal  grants.  For  example,  I  have  been  funded  by  the

EPA,  by  NOAA,  several  agencies  within  NOAA,  ANS,  Solestol  Kennedy,  I  have  received  NSF 
funding.  All  as  part  of  the  programmatic  opportunity,  at  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program 
created  for  people  interested  in  understanding  how  to  do  this  restoration,  how  to  make  it 
effective,  and  why  it  actually  works. 

Two  contributions,  three  contributions  that  will  be  the  last  I  say.  Three  contributions  that  we 
made,  that  come  immediately  to  mind  is,  as  a  group,  the  scientists  involved  in  the  Estuary 
Enhancement  Program  developed  the  practitioner  skills,  or  methods,  for  restoring  wetlands. 
What  kinds  of  criteria  and  metrics  should  you  be  thinking  about,  when  you  go  in  to  restore  a 
site?  Those  metrics  have  been  fully  adopted  by  Restore  America's  Estuaries,  and  has  been 
published  as  a  public  document  by  them.  We  published  it,  of  course,  in  the  peer  reviewed 
literature,  on  our  own. 

Secondly,  one  of  the  toughest  things  to  do,  when  you  are  trying  to  look  at  these  restored  sites 
with  respect  to  the  returns  of  functions  and  processes,  as  opposed  to  the  structure  of  these 
sites,  it  is  relatively  easy  to  grow  grass.  I  apologize  to  my  friends  in  the  Corps.  But  you  are  the 
guys  that  told  me  to  keep  it  simple,  stupid.  We  can  defend  85  percent  survival  after  three  years 
in  court,  to  a  wetland  ecologist  that  means  absolutely  nothing,  other  than  you  are  pretty  good  at 
growing  grass,  which  I  guess  is  not  bad.  (0001-14-7  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  PSEG's  estuarine  enhancement 
program  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  existing  environment. 

Comment:  I  mention  that  we  are  able  to  employ  new,  really  state  of  the  art,  modeling  efforts, 
something  called  Echopath  and  Echosim,  if  any  of  you  are  familiar  with  it,  to  demonstrate,  once 
again,  that  the  increment  of  new  production,  one  is  measurable  against  background,  and  two,  it 
is  equated  with  the  goals  of  the  program.  This  is  one  of  the  most  important  projects  with  regard 
to  coastal  wetland  management,  and  coastal  management  in  general,  that  has  ever  been 
undertaken. 

And  I,  personally,  applaud  the  foresight  of  the  company  to  do  something  like  this,  when  it  wasn't 
considered,  at  the  time,  best  management  practices.  And  whether  it  becomes  best 
management  practice,  regulatory  or  law,  or  otherwise  it  clearly  has  been.  (0001-14-9  [Weinstein,

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  PSEG's  estuarine  enhancement 
program  in  Section  2.4  of  the  E/S  as  part  of  the  existing  environment. 

Comment:  Construction  of  a  new  nuclear  facility  and  access  road,  at  this  location,  will  result  in 
the  damage  of  wetlands,  and  adverse  effects  on  a  variety  of  aquatic  life,  bird  life,  and  wild  life. 
(0001-19-3  [Blake,  Matt]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  impacts  of  the  proposed  project  on  aquatic  and 
terrestrial  wildlife,  along  with  mitigation  measures,  as  necessary,  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the 
EIS. 

Comment:  The  natural  systems  of  the  Delaware  River  and  estuary  are  critical  environments, 
with  major  significance  for  both  regional  and  global  biodiversity,  for  regional  water  supply,  and

water  quality,  and  for  supporting  important  environmental  activities.  Construction  on  the  scale 
proposed  by  PSEG,  on  the  Delaware  coast,  requires  careful  consideration  of  environmental 
factors.  (0001-4-1  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  cumulative  impacts  of  the  project,  including  potential 
impacts  to  the  Delaware  River  and  estuary,  in  Section  7.3  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Before  addressing  the  new  construction,  I  would  like  to  point  out  PSEG's  past 
efforts  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  its  operations  on  the  aquatic  environment  in  the  vicinity.  In 
particular,  faced  with  concerns  of  negative  impacts  on  fisheries,  by  cooling  water  intake 
operations,  PSEG  responded  with  the  largest  private  wetlands  restoration  project  in  the  world. 
The  Estuary  and  Enhancement  program  began  in  1994,  and  since  that  time  has  had  large  scale 
efforts  to  restore  and  preserve  portions  of  the  Delaware  River  estuary,  in  both  New  Jersey  and 
Delaware.  It  has  restored,  enhanced  and/or  preserved  more  than  20,000  acres  of  salt  marsh, 
and  adjacent  uplands  to  vital,  healthy  habitat  for  fish  and  wildlife.  (0001-4-3  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  PSEG's  restoration,  preservation  and 
enhancement  efforts  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  existing  environment. 

Comment:  The  proposed  new  construction  will  permanently  impact  approximately  230  acres  of 
wetlands.  While  protection  of  wetlands  is  a  high  national  priority,  the  majority  of  the  wetlands 
acreage  impacted  by  the  new  construction,  has  a  degraded  hydro  period  that  is  now  a  host  of 
mono  culture  of  phragmites. 

An  invasive  reed  plant,  phragmites  is  often  found  in  disturbed  marsh  areas,  where  plant 
communities,  hydrology  and  topography  have  been  altered.  Phragmites  displaces  native  plants, 
and  has  a  negative  impact  on  biodiversity.  Targeting  these  degraded  wetlands  in  close 
proximity  of  the  existing  facilities,  will  reduce  the  need  for  new  infrastructure,  minimizing  the 
environmental  disturbance  that  would  result  if  development  occurred  in  green  field  sort  of  sites. 

Moreover,  the  amount  of  wetlands  impacted  represent  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  wetland, 
many  with  higher  quality  functions  present  in  the  vicinity  of  the  construction. 

In  addition,  85  acres  of  the  wetland  being  permanently  altered  by  the  construction  are  located  in 
the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  disposal  facility.  This  has  been  a  site  for  dumping  of  spoils  from 
deepening  of  the  Delaware  River  channel.  It  is  surrounded  by  dikes,  and  not  open  to  tidal 
influences.  It  is  unlikely  that  this  site  supports  high  level  wetlands  functions,  and  utilizing  it, 
where  the  permanent  construction  is  necessary,  will  limit  overall  wetland  impacts. 

PSEG  is  making  acceptable  efforts  to  restrict  impact  on  these  wetlands,  including  a  site  plan  to 
minimize  encroachment,  the  use  of  sediment  pits  to  stage  some  of  the  construction  operations, 
and  the  use  of  raised  causeways,  rather  than  using  fill  material  to  carry  the  access  road  to  the 
new  site. 

Where  permanent  disturbance  to  wetlands  occurs,  PSEG  has  outlined  a  tentative  mitigation 
plan  that  would  create  new  wetland  environments,  in  adequate  amounts,  to  offset  any  loss.  We 
anticipate  that  the  resources  and  expertise  in  the  development  of  the  Estuary  Enhancement

Program  will  provide  a  very  strong  foundation  for  the  mitigation  steps  being  taken  by  PSEG,  and 
the  new  site  construction,  both  in  selecting  the  mitigation  sites,  and  managing  the  restored  and 
enhanced  wetland  sites.  (0001-4-5  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  potential  ecological  impacts  of  the 
proposed  project,  including  causeway  construction,  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS.  Any 
mitigation  measures,  proposed  by  the  applicant,  including  any  wetland  enhancement  efforts,  will 
be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3. 

Comment:  You  will  hear  that  reactors  are  a  threat  to  wildlife,  but  humans  are  among  the 
species  most  sensitive  to  radioactivity,  and  their  health  has  not  been  harmed.  What  will  be  an 
immeasurably  small  effect  on  wildlife  from  regulated  releases,  should  be  contrasted  with  the 
extensive  damage  to  habitat,  that  would  result  from  renewable  installations,  which  you  will  hear 
about  shortly.  (0001-5-5  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  evaluate  the  radiological  impacts  to  wildlife  from  normal 
operation  of  the  proposed  reactor  in  Section  5.3  of  the  EIS.  Potential  effects  on  ecological 
receptors  will  be  assessed  based  on  appropriate  exposure  scenarios.  Any  mitigation  measures, 
proposed  by  the  applicant,  to  minimize  this  potential  impact  will  also  be  discussed  in  the  EIS  in 
Section  5. 3.  Potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  resulting  from  the  proposed  project  will  be 
contrasted  against  implementation  of  other  energy  alternatives  in  Chapter  9  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Whether  the  area  is  on  land,  or  offshore,  it  is  mind  boggling  to  think  of  the  potential 
harm,  and  humongous  impacts  of  industrial  wind.  On  land,  particularly,  the  Appalachian 
Mountains  of  the  East,  the  396,000  acres,  required,  would  destroy  the  mainly  unfragmented, 
biologically  rich  forests,  which  are  not  only  habitat  for  bats  and  nesting  neo-tropical  birds,  but 
also  habitat  for  terrestrial  flora  and  fauna.  The  area  is,  also,  a  major  migratory  corridor  for  birds, 
bats,  and  raptors.  Yet  without  full  review  of  environmental  impacts,  or  cost  to  taxpayers  and 
customers,  permits  are  being  granted.  (0001-7-8  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  resulting  from 
the  proposed  project  in  contrast  to  implementation  of  other  energy  alternatives  in  Chapter  9  of 
the  EIS.

As  for  the  impacts  offshore,  we  really  can't  know  the  full  extent  of  the  harm  turbines  will  have  on 
the  aquatic  resources,  benthic  organisms,  oceanic  mammals,  or  pelagic  birds.  Where  is  the 
precautionary  principle  in  the  blind  acceptance  of,  and  push  for,  such  a  destructive  form  of 
energy?

Comment:  After  reviewing  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program,  by  PSEG,  I'm  impressed  by 
their  innovative  mitigation  measures,  such  as  wetland  restoration,  phragmites  control,  fish 
protection  at  the  nuclear  sites,  restoration  of  anadromous  fish  migration,  through  fish  ladders, 
research,  et  cetera.  These  programs  have  resulted  in  long  lasting  benefits  for  the  saltwater 
estuary,  including  expanded  biological  diversity  and  habitats,  breeding  areas,  food  sources  for 
aquatic,  terrestrial,  and  avian  species,  especially  threatened  and  endangered  species,  and 
better  water  quality.  This  leads  me  to  believe  that  PSEG  will  do  an  excellent  job  of  mitigation  in 
the  future.  (0001-7-11  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  PSEG's  restoration,  preservation  and 
enhancement  efforts  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  existing  environment.  Mitigation 
measures  proposed  by  the  applicant  to  minimize  impacts  and  enhance  terrestrial  resources  will 
be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  And  I  was  really  pleased  to  hear  that  the  proposed  site  for  these  new  reactors  will 
be  on  land  that  is  primarily  phragmites,  right  now.  That  is  a  good  thing  to  get  rid  of.  (0001-7-13 
[Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  describe  the  existing  wetlands  that  could  be 
affected  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS.  Staff  will  discuss  impacts  to  wetland  resources  in  Sections 
4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  The  Environmental  Report  indicates  an  overall  wetlands  impact  of  about  229  acres, 
from  the  new  plant,  and  proposed  causeway.  It  is  further  indicated  that  there  is  an  abundance 
of  wetlands  in  the  vicinity,  totaling  more  than  25,000  acres,  and  the  quality  of  a  dominant 
species,  as  we  heard  previously,  is  phragmites. 

Additional  lands  targeted  for  acquisition  through  a  land  right  exchange  to  the  north  of  the  site, 
are  part  of  an  existing  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  confined  disposal  facility  area  that  is 
surrounded  by  dikes  and  not  open  to  the  tides. 

PSEG  would  reduce  environmental  impacts  by  placing  permanent  facilities  inside  these  diked 
areas.  And  compensation  for  use  of  these  wetlands,  we  would  recommend  that  PSEG  create  or 
restore  degraded  wetlands,  within  the  Delaware  Bay  region,  at  an  appropriate  compensation 
ratio.  (0001-8-10  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  measures  proposed  by  the  applicant, 
including  any  wetland  enhancement  efforts,  in  Sections  4. 3  and  5. 3  of  the  EIS.  Potential  off-site

mitigation  measures  will  also  be  fully  discussed  in  the  EIS  in  Section  4.3.  A  bay-wide  approach 
will  be  similarly  emphasized  over  a  site-specific  evaluation  that  can  overlook  the  benefits  of  an 
overall  ecosystem  approach. 

Comment:  Although  the  existing  PSEG  nuclear  complex  is  an  ideal  location  for  an  additional 
unit,  because  all  of  the  important  conveyance  systems  are  in  place,  and  those  will  not  have  to 
be  developed,  such  as  they  would  if  it  was  a  greenfield  site.  New  improvements,  such  as 
roadways,  should  be  carefully  placed  and  designed  to  minimize  their  impact  on  marshlands.  An 
elevated  road  system  would  be  a  design  that  would  help  minimize  these  impacts.  We 
encourage  PSEG  to  pursue  such  a  design,  and  develop  a  comprehensive  wetlands  mitigation 
and  compensation  plan  for  these  impacts.  (0001-8-11  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  proposed  by  the  applicant  for  ecological 
impacts  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS.  This  will  include  a  complete  discussion  of  design 
measures  to  minimize  such  impacts.  To  the  extent  that  they  are  deemed  necessary,  wetlands 
mitigation  and  plans  for  enhancement  and  compensation  will  be  fully  discussed. 

Comment:  Particularly  impressed,  from  an  ecologist's  standpoint,  were  the  tremendous  input 
and  environmental  plus  that  they  took  a  20,000  acre  restoration  program,  instituted  by  PSEG, 
has  provided  in  the  environment.  It  is  a  real,  it  is  internationally  recognized  as  something  of  real 
value,  and  it  certainly  has  made  a  major  change  in  the  ecosystem,  in  those  areas  where  it  has 
already  been  established,  and  we  are  very  optimistic  about  the  program  continuing  on  into  the 
future.  (0001-9-3  [Lacandro,  Roger]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  PSEG's  restoration,  preservation  and 
enhancement  efforts  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  existing  environment. 

Comment:  And  I  know  that  one  of  the  potential  or  likely  environmental  impacts  has  to  do  with 
wetlands,  the  proposed  construction  of  this  facility.  I  have  to  tell  you  that  I'm  very  comfortable 
with  PSEG  dealing  with  the  challenges  of  mitigating  impacts  on  wetlands  and,  actually,  their 
commitment  to  restoring  wetlands.  They  have  been  involved  with,  perhaps,  one  of  the  largest 
estuarine  restoration  programs  in  the  country,  20,000  acres  of  wetlands  restored  in  Delaware 
Bay,  the  River,  and  the  estuary,  and  it  has  led  to  increased  production  of  fin  fish  and  shell  fish. 
So  there  are,  like,  wetland  impacts.  But  I  think  the  company  is  certainly  up  to  the  challenge  of 
mitigating  those.  (0002-4-2  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  potential  wetland  impacts  resulting 
from  the  proposed  project  in  Sections  4. 3  and  5. 3  of  the  EIS.  Overall  restoration,  preservation 
and  enhancement  efforts  will  also  be  discussed  as  part  of  the  existing  environment  in  Section 
2.4  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  has  done  a  phenomenal  job  of  creating 
substantial  new  areas  of  high  quality  wetland  habitat,  which  very  definitely  has  an  impact  on,  in 
particular,  juveniles  of  a  wide  variety  of  aquatic  species,  and  nutrient  flow,  in  the  area.  And  it, 
really,  is  a  phenomenal  laboratory  at  this  point  for  understanding  the  importance  of,  and  the 
development  of,  those  types  of  habitats.  Most  of  those  habitats  were  much  less  productive  prior

to  the  work  that  PSEG  engaged  in,  having  been  really  run  over  by  exotic  phragmites.  That 
made  them  much  less  valuable  as  natural  systems  than  they  are  today.  (0002-5-1  [Duvall,  Brian])

Comment:  But  you  know  something?  The  ducks  are  still  flying,  the  water  fowl  are  still  doing 
well,  and  there  are  still  muskrats.  And  I  believe  if  there  is  going  to  be  an  additional  plant,  it  is  a 
great  place  to  have  it,  the  infrastructure  is  there.  (0002-8-5  [Campbell,  Keith]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  describe  the  terrestrial  ecology  of  the  area, 
including  wildlife  resources,  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Construction  of  a  new  nuclear  facility  and  access  road  at  this  location  will  result  in 
the  damage  of  wetlands  and  have  adverse  effects  on  a  variety  of  aquatic  life,  bird  life  and 
wildlife.  (0003-3  [Batty,  Sandy]  [Dillingham,  Tim]  [Galetto,  Jane  Morton]  [Goldsmith,  Amy]  [McNutt, 
Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [O'Gorman,  Margaret]  [Schulte,  James]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  and  wetlands 
as  a  result  of  this  project  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS.  Any  mitigation  measures  proposed 
by  the  applicant,  including  any  wetland  enhancement  efforts,  will  also  be  discussed  in  Sections 
4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS.  Potential  off-site  mitigation  measures  will  be  fully  discussed  in  the  EIS  in 
Section  4.3.  A  bay-wide  approach  will  be  similarly  emphasized  over  a  site-specific  evaluation 
that  can  overlook  the  benefits  of  an  overall  ecosystem  approach. 

Comment:  The  Army  Corps  and  PSEG  must  consider  an  alternative  to  the  land  swap,  such  as 
using  the  existing  access  road  to  Artificial  Island  instead  of  creating  a  second  road,  if  and  when 
a  new  nuclear  facility  is  permitted.  This  would  avoid  destruction  of  wetlands  and  obviate  the 
need  for  a  new  dredge  disposal  site.  In  our  view,  the  existing  access  road  should  be  sufficient 
and  no  additional  destruction  of  wetlands  should  be  permitted  at  the  site.  Issues  associated 
with  a  new  spoil  disposal  site  are  as  yet  unknown  as  the  sites  under  consideration  are  unknown. 
But  there  are  likely  to  be  issues,  considering  the  Anny  Corps'  preference  for  riverfront  lands.

in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS.  Any  mitigation  measures  proposed  by  the  applicant, 
including  efforts  to  minimize  wetland  impacts,  will  also  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of 
the  EIS. 

Comment:  To  many  environmental  groups  renewable  energy  is  a  preferable  alternative  to 
reactors.  To  those  concerned  with  the  conservation  of  biological  diversity,  however,  the 
cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  large-scale  renewable  projects  will  be  their  most  detrimental 
effect.  We  believe  that  concern  for  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  the  Alternatives,  wind, 
solar,  and  biomass  should  be  included  in  the  final  EIS  as  a  reason  for  rejecting  them  as  an 
alternative.  (0007-7  [Lewis,  Kenneth])

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  resulting  from 
the  proposed  project  in  contrast  to  implementation  of  other  energy  alternatives  in  Chapter  9  of 
the  EIS. 

Comment:  Much  of  the  needed  science  for  the  ESP  should  be  at  hand  since  the  new  station  is 
being  sited  adjacent  to  Hope  Creek  and  Salem  Creek  generation  stations;  their  track  record 
appears  to  be  good,  the  new  site  will  share  the  same  geology,  use  of  in  place  dredge  spoils 
constituting  all  soils  of  the  area-thus,  artificial  Island.  Natural  resource  impacts  must  be  the 
same  for  all  sites  in  this  homogeneous  environment.  The  20,000  acre  restoration  program 
instituted  by  PS&G  in  the  greater  area  has  only  provided  added  benefit  to  the  recovery  of 
nearby  wetlands,  an  internationally  recognized  success.  Plans  appear  to  be  in  place  to  expand 
the  restoration  program  to  continue  to  benefit  the  area.  (0008-4  [Lacandro,  Roger]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  PSEG's  restoration,  preservation  and 
enhancement  efforts  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  existing  environment. 

Comment:  During  the  re-permitting  of  the  existing  nuclear  facilities  at  Salem,  PSE&G 
developed  a  bay-wide  concept  of  mitigating  the  impacts  of  the  existing  cooling  apparatus  at  the 
facilities.  They  were  creative  in  identifying  a  variety  of  ways  that  the  bay-wide  resource  value 
could  be  improved  through  investment  in  projects  throughout  the  Delaware  Bay  estuary.  I  was 
attracted  by  the  scope  of  their  thinking  and  the  resources  they  could  bring  to  the  table.  I 
testified  in  favor  of  this  mitigation  idea  at  the  re-permitting  hearings. 

Since  then  I  have  followed,  with  my  students  and  with  great  interest,  what  has  become  the 
largest  Estuarine  Enhancement  project  in  the  world.  Without  going  into  details,  the  project  has 
been  a  resounding  success  at  many  levels  in  increasing  the  resource  value  of  large  acreages 
throughout  the  Bay.  PSE&G  has  a  solid  track  record  in  delivering  on  their  commitment  to 
baywide  health.  (0010-4  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  ecological  impact  mitigation,  as 
proposed  by  the  applicant,  in  Section  5.3  of  the  EIS.  PSEG's  estuarine  enhancement  program 
will  be  discussed  in  Section  2. 4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  existing  environment.  The  EIS  will  also 
include  a  discussion  of  the  bay -wide  approach  undertaken  by  PS  EG. 

Comment:  Returning  to  the  purpose  of  this  hearing.  Should  this  project  move  ahead  toward 
construction,  there  will  be  on-site  habitat  impacts  that  will  be  unavoidable.  I  urge  the  process  to 
embrace  the  same  baywide  approach  used  in  the  Estuarine  Enhancement  program,  and  to  be 
creative  and  aggressive  in  identifying  off  site  mitigation  opportunities.  (0010-6  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  off-site  mitigation  measures  as  proposed  by  the 
applicant  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  A  bay-wide  approach  will  be  similarly  emphasized  over  a 
site-specific  evaluation  that  can  overlook  the  benefits  of  an  overall  ecosystem  approach. 

Comment:  The  Environmental  Report  indicates  an  overall  wetlands  impact  of  229  acres  from 
the  new  plant  and  proposed  causeway.  It  is  further  indicated  there  is  an  abundance  of  wetlands 
in  the  vicinity  totaling  more  than  25,000  acres  and  the  quality  of  the  dominant  species  is 
invasive  Phragmites.  Additional  lands  targeted  for  acquisition  through  a  land  right  exchange  to

the  north  of  the  site  are  part  of  an  existing  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  Confined  Disposal  Facility 
area  (CDF)  that  is  surrounded  by  dikes  and  not  open  to  tides.  PSEG  would  reduce 
environmental  impacts  by  placing  permanent  facilities  inside  these  diked  areas.  In 
compensation  for  use  of  these  wetlands  we  would  recommend  that  PSEG  create  or  restore 
degraded  wetlands  within  the  Delaware  Bay  region  at  an  appropriate  compensation  ratio.  This 
should  be  an  achievable  undertaking  by  PSEG  as  their  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  has 
been  recognized  nationally  for  restoring  and  protecting  over  20,000  acres  of  wetlands  and 
adjoining  properties  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  in  both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  (0011-11 
[Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  as  proposed  by  the  applicant,  including 
any  wetland  enhancement  efforts,  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  Potential  off -site  mitigation 
measures  will  be  fully  discussed,  as  necessary,  in  the  EIS  in  Section  4.3.  A  bay -wide  approach 
will  be  similarly  emphasized  over  a  site-specific  evaluation  that  can  overlook  the  benefits  of  an 
overall  ecosystem  approach. 

Comment:  Although  the  existing  PSEG's  existing  nuclear  complex  is  an  ideal  location  for  an 
additional  unit  because  all  of  the  important  conveyance  systems  are  in  place  and  would  not 
have  to  be  developed  and  built  as  with  a  Greenfield  site,  new  improvements  such  as  roadways 
should  be  carefully  placed  and  designed  to  minimize  their  impact  on  marshlands.  An  elevated 
road  system  would  be  a  design  that  would  help  minimize  these  impacts.  We  encourage  PSEG 
to  pursue  such  a  design  and  develop  a  comprehensive  wetlands  mitigation  and  compensation 
plan  for  these  impacts.  (0011-13  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  measures  as  proposed  by  the  applicant 
for  ecological  impacts  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS.  This  will  include  a  complete 
discussion  of  design  measures  to  minimize  such  impacts.  To  the  extent  they  are  deemed 
necessary,  wetlands  mitigation  and  plans  for  enhancement  and  compensation  will  also  be  fully 
discussed. 

Comment:  In  addition,  I  urge  that  the  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  alternative  energy 
generating  sources  be  included  in  the  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (EIS)  in  order  to  show 
that  by  comparison  nuclear  energy  is  a  far  preferable  option.  (0012-4  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  resulting  from 
the  proposed  project  in  contrast  to  implementation  of  other  energy  alternatives  in  Chapter  9  of 
the  EIS. 

Comment:  I  am  particularly  interested  in  addressing  the  biological  impacts  of  renewables, 
primarily  wind.  This  technology  has  a  huge  impact  on  the  biological  world.  In  order  to  produce 
an  equivalent  amount  energy,  wind  requires  an  enormous  footprint.  As  pointed  out  in  their 
Environmental  Report,  ...  to  replace  the  energy  equivalent  a  2200  MWe  of  nuclear  capacity 
operating  at  90  percent  capacity  factor,  approximately  3300  2  MWe  wind  turbines  operating  at  a 
capacity  factor  of  30  percent  would  be  required.  These  turbines  would  be  sited  on 
396,000  acres  (619  square  miles)  and  disturb  19,800  acres  (31  square  miles)  to  accommodate 
the  physical  footprint  of  the  towers  themselves.  (I  like  the  ESP's  comparison  of  that  amount  of 
land  to  15  times  the  area  of  Newark!)  (0012-8  [Eastman,  Ajax])

the  EIS. 

Comment:  Whether  that  area  is  on  land  or  offshore,  it  is  mind  boggling  to  think  of  potential 
harm  and  humongous  impacts  of  industrial  wind.  On  land,  particularly  in  the  Appalachian 
mountains  of  the  east,  the  396,000  acres  required  would  destroy  the  mainly  unfragmented, 
biologically  rich  forests  which  are  not  only  habitat  for  bats  and  nesting  neo-tropical  birds,  but 
also  habitat  for  terrestrial  flora  and  fauna.  The  area  is  also  a  major  migratory  corridor  for  birds, 
bats,  and  raptors.  Yet  without  full  review  of  the  environmental  impacts  or  the  costs  to  taxpayers 
and  customers,  permits  are  being  granted.  (0012-9  [Eastman,  Ajax])

the  proposed  project  in  contrast  to  implementation  of  other  energy  alternatives  in  Chapter  9  of 
the  EIS. 

Comment:  After  reviewing  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  by  PSEG,  I  am  impressed  by 
their  innovative  mitigation  measures  such  as  wetland  restoration,  phragmites  control,  fish 
protection  at  the  reactor  sites,  restoration  of  anadromous  fish  migration  through  fish  ladders, 
research,  etc.  These  programs  have  resulted  in  long-  lasting  benefits  for  the  saltwater  estuary 
including,  expanded  biological  diversity  and  habitats,  breeding  areas,  food  sources  for  aquatic, 
terrestrial,  and  avian  species,  especially  threatened  and  endangered  species,  and  better  water 
quality.  This  leads  me  to  believe  that  PSEG  will  do  an  excellent  job  of  mitigation  in  the  future.

Comment:  I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  PSE&Gs  environmental  policies  and  actions 
over  twenty  years,  and  their  restoration  and  mitigation  activities  in  support  of  the  environment.  I 
know  of  no  company  that  has  such  a  stellar  environmental  record,  well  beyond  what  has  been 
required  of  them.  Their  environmental  restoration  activities  are  a  model  for  other  states  and 
companies.  I  have  read  their  Environmental  Report,  and  given  what  I  know  about  their  past 
performance  in  habitat  enhancement,  I  am  confident  that  PSE&G  will  carry  out  their  plans,  and 
create  much  more  habitat  than  is  compromised  by  the  new  development.  Further,  the  land  that 
will  be  used  for  siting  the  new  facility,  is  not  currently  natural  high  quality  salt  marsh  or  other 
habitat,  but  is  already  degraded,  By  in  contrast,  I  have  full  confidence  that  the  mitigation  habitat 
will  be  a  functioning,  high  quality  habitat.  I  encourage  the  NRC  to  approve  the  Early  Site  Permit, 
and  lend  my  support  to  PSE&G  for  its  community-minded,  and  ecosystem-conscious  approach 
to  restoration  and  mitigation.  (0013-2  [Burger,  Joanna])

Comment:  Much  of  the  land  that  will  be  used  for  site  construction  of  the  new  nuclear  facility  is 
degraded  Phragmites  wetlands,  and  as  such,  is  not  natural  productive  habitat.  (0013-3  [Burger,

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  describe  wetlands  that  could  be  affected  in 
Section  2. 4  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Their  mitigation  efforts  include  identification  of  several  candidate  areas  that  may  be 
selected  for  the  development  of  a  wetland  mitigation  plan  for  the  restoration  and  enhancement 
in  Elsinboro,  and  work  with  Mannington  Marsh.  Both  of  these  habitats  will  be  greatly  improved 
by  PSE&G's  mitigation  work,  and  the  restored  habitat  will  provide  much  higher  quality  habitat 
than  is  even  possible  with  the  planned  construction  site.  The  natural  tidal  flow  in  the  planned 
restoration/mitigation  habitat  will  lead  to  habitat  with  far  greater  wildlife  use  and  ecosystem 
integrity.  This  part  of  the  Delaware  Bay  ecosystem  will  be  greatly  aided  by  the  restoration 
planned  by  PSE&G.  (0013-4  [Burger,  Joanna]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  measures  as  proposed 
by  the  applicant  for  impacts  to  wetlands  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  The  Environmental  Plan  they  present  is  sound,  well-thought  out,  and  sufficiently 
developed  to  ensure  that  it  can  accomplished.  The  Environmental  Report  is  extensive, 
comprehensive,  and  devotes  considerable  attention  not  only  to  the  environmental,  physical,  and 
ecosystem  issues,  but  to  appropriate  public  involvement  and  monitoring.  As  an  ecologist  I  have 
been  impressed  with  their  due  diligence  in  addressing  all  the  outstanding  environmental  issues, 
and  going  well  beyond  what  is  necessary  in  terms  of  mitigation  and  restoration  of  additional 
habitat.  The  State  of  New  Jersey  will  be  gaining  considerable  high  quality  habitat  by  these 
actions,  in  exchange  for  degraded,  low  quality  Phragmites  marsh  that  is  on  the  current  site  (and 
that  will  be  the  site  of  the  new  nuclear  facility).  (0013-5  [Burger,  Joanna]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  measures  as  proposed 
by  the  applicant,  including  any  wetland  enhancement  efforts,  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS. 
Potential  off-site  mitigation  measures  will  also  be  discussed,  as  necessary,  in  the  EIS  in  Section 
4.3.  A  bay-wide  approach  will  be  similarly  emphasized  over  a  site-specific  evaluation  that  can 
overlook  the  benefits  of  an  overall  ecosystem  approach. 

Comment:  The  plans  proposed  by  PSE&G  can  be  viewed  in  light  of  their  past  mitigation  and 
restoration  activities.  They  have  one  of  the  largest  and  most  successful  mitigation  projects  in 
the  country,  where  they  controlled  Phragmites  to  produce  high  quality  salt  marsh  with  attendant 
mudflats  and  intertidal  habitat  that  is  used  by  thousands  of  shorebirds  and  other  species.  Thus 
their  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  is  one  of  the  most  successful  in  the  country,  has  received 
a  variety  of  state  and  national  awards  -and  unlike  many  other  such  programs,  it  is  sustainable. 
Thus,  it  is  my  professional  opinion  that  they  are  capable  of,  and  will,  deliver  on  their 
environmental  mitigation  and  restoration  plans.  The  company  has  integrity  and  environmental 
vision  to  ensure  that  there  is  little  environmental  impact,  and  that  their  restoration  and. 
mitigation  plans  will  result  in  far  more,  high-quality  habitat  than  is  presently  on  site.  (0013-6

Comment:  Before  addressing  the  new  construction,  I  would  point  out  PSEG’s  past  efforts  to 
mitigate  the  effects  of  its  operations  on  the  aquatic  environment  in  the  Salem  vicinity.  In 
particular,  faced  with  concerns  of  negative  impacts  on  fisheries  by  cooling  water  intake 
operations,  PSEG  responded  with  the  largest  private  wetlands  restoration  project  in  the  world. 
The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  began  in  1994  and  since  that  time  has  been  a  large  scale 
effort  to  restore  and  preserve  portions  of  the  Delaware  Estuary  in  both  New  Jersey  and 
Delaware.  PSEG  has  restored,  enhanced,  and/or  preserved  more  than  20,000  acres  of  salt 
marsh  and  adjacent  uplands  to  vital,  healthy  habitat  for  fish  and  wildlife. 

Restoration  efforts  have  included  the  goal  of  replacing  former  salt  hay  farms  and  marshes 
dominated  by  invasive  Phragmites  australis  with  salt  cord  grass-dominated  marsh.  The 
Academy  has  studied  many  of  these  sites  prior  to  restoration  and  visited  a  number  afterwards. 
The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  has  been  successful  in  restoring  typical  salt  marsh 
conditions  at  the  sites,  with  most  sites  meeting  targets  for  reduction  in  Phragmites  and 
establishment  of  salt  cordgrass.  Many  of  these  and  related  studies  have  been  published  in 
various  peer-reviewed  scientific  journals.  (0014-3  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  PSEG's  restoration,  preservation  and 
enhancement  efforts  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  existing  environment. 

Comment:  The  proposed  new  construction  will  permanently  impact  approximately  229  acres  of 
wetland.  While  protection  of  wetland  is  a  high  national  priority  (as  demonstrated  by  Section  404 
of  the  Clean  Water  Act),  the  majority  of  the  wetland  acreage  impacted  by  the  new  construction 
has  a  degraded  hydroperiod  and  now  hosts  a  monoculture  of  Phragmites  australis.  An  invasive 
reed  grass,  Phragmites  is  often  found  in  disturbed  marsh  areas,  where  plant  communities, 
hydrology  and  topography  have  been  altered.  Phragmites  displaces  native  plants  and  has  a 
negative  impact  on  biodiversity. 

Targeting  these  degraded  wetlands  in  close  proximity  to  existing  PSEG  facilities  will  reduce  the 
need  for  new  infrastructure,  minimizing  the  environmental  disturbance  that  would  result  if 
development  occurred  in  "Greenfield”  sites.  Moreover,  the  amount  of  wetlands  impacted 
represents  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  wetland  -  many  with  higher  quality  functions  -  present  in 
the  vicinity  of  the  construction. 

In  addition,  85  acres  of  the  wetland  being  permanently  altered  by  the  construction  are  located  in 
the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  Combined  Disposal  Facility  (CDF.)  This  has  been  the  site  for 
dumping  of  dredge  spoils  from  deepening  of  the  Delaware  River  Channel.  It  is  surrounded  by 
dikes  and  is  not  open  to  tidal  influences.  It  is  unlikely  that  this  site  supports  high  level  wetland 
functions  and  utilizing  it  where  permanent  construction  is  necessary  will  limit  overall  wetland 
impacts.  (0014-5  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  measures  as  proposed 
by  the  applicant  including  any  wetland  enhancement  efforts,  In  Sections  4. 3  and  5. 3  of  the  EIS. 
Potential  off-site  mitigation  measures  will  also  be  discussed  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  A  bay-wide 
approach  will  be  similarly  emphasized  over  a  site-specific  evaluation  that  can  overlook  the 
benefits  of  an  overall  ecosystem  approach.

Comment:  PSEG  is  making  acceptable  efforts  to  restrict  impact  on  these  wetlands,  including  a 
site  plan  to  minimize  encroachment,  the  use  of  sediments  pits  to  stage  some  of  the  construction 
operations,  and  the  use  of  a  raised  causeway  rather  than  using  fill  material  to  carry  the  access 
road  to  the  new  site.  Where  permanent  disturbance  to  wetland  occurs,  PSEG  has  outlined  a 
mitigation  plan  that  should  create  new  wetland  environments  in  adequate  amounts  to  offset  any 
loss.  We  anticipate  that  the  resources  and  expertise  developed  in  the  EEP  will  provide  a 
foundation  for  the  mitigation  steps  being  taken  by  PSEG  in  the  new  site  construction,  both  in 
selecting  the  mitigation  sites  and  in  managing  the  restored  and  enhanced  wetland  sites.  (0014-7

by  the  applicant,  including  any  wetland  enhancement  efforts,  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  The  basic  restoration  activities  developed  by  the  EEP,  particularly  controlling 
Phragmites  and  fostering  development  of  good  tidal  marsh  topography  and  hydrology,  have 
advanced  the  field  of  ecological  restoration.  The  ecological  engineering  technique  of  forming 
primary  channels  and  using  estuarine  processes  to  further  develop  channels  and  topography  is 
especially  notable.  As  such,  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  has  provides  an  important 
model  for  marshland  restoration  which  is  an  important  component  of  PSEG’s  proposed 
mitigation  plan.  (0014-9  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  measures  as  proposed 
by  the  applicant,  including  any  wetland  enhancement  efforts,  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS.

Comment:  Therefore,  DRN  urges  NRC  to  review  certain  issues  in  more  detail,  including: 
clearer  evaluation  of  PSEG's  use  of  the  Army  Corps  confined  disposal  facility,  and  cumulative 
impacts  resulting  from  use  of  that  site;  water  impacts  including  dredging  and  construction 
impacts;  filling  of  wetlands;  floodplain  impacts;  habitat  impacts  and  impacts  to  species, 
especially  Atlantic  sturgeon;  and  impacts  and  evaluation  of  alternatives  for  cooling  systems. 
(0018-3  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  measures  as  proposed  by  the  applicant 
for  ecological  impacts  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS.  This  will  include  a  complete 
discussion  of  design  measures  to  minimize  such  impacts.  To  the  extent  they  are  included, 
wetlands  mitigation  and  plans  for  enhancement  and  compensation  will  be  fully  discussed.  This 
will  include  an  evaluation  of  PSEG's  use  of  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers'  confined  disposal 
facility.  The  cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecosystems  resulting  from  the  use  of 
that  site  will  be  discussed  in  Section  7.3  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  The  ER  also  estimates  that  the  Project  will  permanently  disturb  126.6  acres  of 
wetlands  on  the  site.  The  EIS  must  make  a  full  and  fair  evaluation  of  the  impacts  of  this 
permanent  loss  of  wetlands  and  habitat,  and  consider  all  viable  alternatives  to  this  loss.

for  ecological  impacts  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS.  This  will  include  a  complete 
discussion  of  design  measures  to  minimize  such  impacts.  To  the  extent  they  are  necessary, 
wetlands  mitigation  and  plans  for  enhancement  and  compensation  will  be  fully  discussed. 

Comment:  The  Division  of  Land  Use  Regulation  has  received  the  PSEG  Early  Site  Permit 
(ESP)  application  and  has  determined  that  the  project  will  require  permits. 

As  proposed,  the  project  will  require  a  CAFRA  Individual  Permit,  Coastal  Wetlands  Permit, 
Waterfront  Development  Permit  and  Freshwater  Wetlands  Individual  Permit  from  the  Division. 
These  permits  must  be  obtained  prior  to  any  construction  activities  on  the  site  related  to  the 
project  described  above.  The  Division  has  issued  a  consistency  determination  for  the  project 
that  was  sent  to  PSE&G  representatives  on  July  19,  2010.  (0019-22  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  permit  and  other  regulatory 
requirements  associated  with  the  project  in  Chapter  7  and  Appendix  H  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Guidelines  under  Section  404(b)(1)  of  the  federal  Clean  Water  Act  require  that 
actions  proposed  within  waters  of  the  United  States,  especially  those  that  are  not  water- 
dependent,  are  required  to  demonstrate  that  they  have  considered  all  appropriate  reasonable 
and  prudent  measures  to  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  to  waters.  If  all  measures  to  avoid  and 
minimize  wetland  impacts  have  been  considered  and  employed  to  the  extent  practicable  and 
result  in  unavoidable  impacts,  a  compensatory  mitigation  plan  should  be  developed  and 
implemented. 

The  applicant  should  undertake  a  complete  analysis  of  alternatives  that  complies  fully  with  the 
Clean  Water  Act  Section  404  (b)(1 )  Guidelines  that  documents  avoidance,  minimization  and 
mitigation  for  all  impacts.  Alternate  locations  as  well  as  a  documentation  of  purpose  and  need 
should  be  provided  as  part  of  this  analysis.  For  any  unavoidable  impacts,  a  compensatory 
mitigation  plan  to  offset  all  of  the  projects  impacts  to  aquatic  resources  including  EFH  should  be 
developed  in  accordance  with  the  federal  standards  and  criteria  for  compensatory  mitigation  for 
losses  of  aquatic  resources  published  in  the  Federal  Register  on  April  10,  2008  (vol.  73  No. 

70).  This  plan  should  be  developed  as  early  in  the  permit  process  as  possible  and  in 
consultation  with  the  applicable  federal,  state  and  local  resource  agencies  and  will  be 
implemented  on  and  in  the  immediate  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  to  the  extent  practicable.  (0022-5 
[Gorski,  Stanley]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  measures  as  proposed  by  the  applicant 
for  ecological  impacts  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS.  This  will  include  a  complete 
discussion  of  design  measures  to  minimize  such  impacts.  To  the  extent  they  are  necessary 
wetlands  mitigation  and  plans  for  enhancement  and  compensation  will  be  fully  discussed. 
Alternative  locations  will  be  discussed  in  Chapter  9  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  In  the  State  of  NJ,  coastal  wetlands  are  regulated  by  the  state  under  the  Wetlands 
Act  of  1970.  Development  in  coastal  wetlands  requires  authorization  of  permits  from  the 
NJDEP.  and  requires  separate  processes  to  determine  a  project's  value.  However,  such 
processes  usually  fit  in  within  a  federal  process.  (0022-8  [Gorski,  Stanley])

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  permit  and  other  regulatory 
requirements  associated  with  the  project  in  Chapter  1  and  Appendix  H  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  After  reasonable  measures  have  been  explored  to  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  to 
wetlands,  PSEG  will  compensate  for  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  wetlands  by  implementing 
approved  wetland  restoration  and/or  rehabilitation  measures.  PSEG,  through  their  Ecosystem 
Enhancement  Program,  has  extensive  experience  and  demonstrated  success  implementing 
coastal  saltmarsh  and  freshwater  wetland  restoration  and  rehabilitation  programs.  This 
familiarity  with  local  wetland  systems  was  used  to  identify  appropriate  candidate  mitigation  sites 
and  will  be  used  in  developing  and  implementing  the  final  approved  mitigation  plan. 

Mitigation  options  mentioned  in  the  NRC's  ESP  to  offset  the  impacts  to  NOAA  trust  resources 
included  the  following  considerations: 

•  Minimization  of  encroachment  on  coastal  wetlands 

•  Use  of  previously  developed  sediment  disposal  basins  for  plant  development  (both  PSEG's 
permitted  disposal  facility  and  the  USACE's  CDF) 

•  Refinement  of  the  Site  Utilization  Plan  to  avoid  various  wetland  areas  throughout  the  PSEG 
Site 

Opportunities  for  mitigating  unavoidable  impacts  to  wetland  ecosystems  include  restoration  of 
natural  habitats  temporarily  disturbed  by  construction,  creation  of  new  habitat  types  in 
previously  disturbed  areas,  and  enhancement  of  undisturbed  natural  habitats. 

In  general,  NMFS  does  not  accept  the  conversion  of  one  type  of  aquatic  habitat  into  another 
habitat  as  compensatory  mitigation  when  the  existing  habitat  has  value  to  aquatic  life. 

Candidate  mitigation  areas  include  portions  of  the  existing  PSEG  Site,  Mannington  Meadow, 
Mason's  Point,  and  additional  areas  of  the  PSEG  Alloway  Creek  Watershed  restoration  site. 
(0022-9  [Gorski,  Stanley]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  measures  as  proposed 
by  the  applicant,  including  any  wetland  enhancement  efforts,  in  Sections  4.3  and  5.3  of  the  EIS. 
Potential  off-site  mitigation  measures  will  also  be  discussed,  as  necessary,  in  the  EIS  in  Section 
4.3.  A  bay-wide  approach  will  be  similarly  emphasized  over  a  site-specific  evaluation  that  can 
overlook  the  benefits  of  an  overall  ecosystem  approach. 

Comment:  Fish  and  Wildlife  Coordination  Act 

Notwithstanding  our  mandates  under  the  MSA,  the  NMFS  also  has  responsibilities  under  the 
Fish  and  Wildlife  Coordination  Act  (FWCA)  to  provide  federal  agencies  such  as  the  NRC  with 
recommendations  to  avoid,  minimize  and  to  mitigate  for  direct,  indirect  and  cumulative  impacts 
to  any  and  all  NOAA  trust  resources  that  are  present  within  the  Delaware  River  Basin.  (0022-11 
[Gorski,  Stanley]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  discuss  any  mitigation  measures  as  proposed 
by  the  applicant  for  ecological  impacts  in  Sections  4. 3  and  5. 3  of  the  EIS.  This  will  include  a 
complete  discussion  of  design  measures  to  minimize  such  impacts.  To  the  extent  they  are

necessary,  wetlands  mitigation  and  plans  for  enhancement  and  compensation  will  be  fully 
discussed.  The  cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecosystems  resulting  from  this 
project  will  be  discussed  in  the  EIS  in  Section  7.3. 

Comment:  Submerged  aquatic  vegetation  (SAV)  has  historically  been  absent  from  Delaware 
Bay.  However,  to  date,  there  has  been  no  comprehensive  mapping  of  SAV  in  the  Delaware 
Estuary  to  verify  its  presence  or  absence.  Several  species  have  been  observed  though  in  the 
tidal  river  since  1970,  including:  Vallisneria  americana,  Myriophyllum  spicatum,  Elodea  nuttallii, 
Najasflexillis,  Potamogeton  sp.  and  others  (Schuyler,  1988).  Wild  celery  (Vallisneria 
americana)  has  been  documented  in  some  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  and  its  tributaries.  SAV 
provides  valuable  nursery,  forage  and  refuge  habitat  for  a  variety  of  fish  including  striped  bass, 
American  shad,  alewife,  and  blueback  herring.  It  is  also  an  important  food  source  for  waterfowl. 
As  water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River  continues  to  improve,  more  areas  of  SAV  may  be  found 
within  the  River.  (0022-13  [Gorski,  Stanley]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  The  NRC  staff  will  describe  the  terrestrial  ecology  of  the  area, 
including  wildlife  resources,  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS. 

D.2.10  Comments  Concerning  Ecology — Aquatic 

Comment:  With  the  new  facility  a  good  thing  is,  if  it  is  built,  that  it  would  have  a  closed  loop 
cooling  system,  which  would  greatly  reduce  the  amount  of  water  needed  to  cool  the  facility.  A 
closed  loop  cooling  system  reduces  the  water  take,  compared  to  an  open  loop  system,  by  90  to 
95  percent.  So  however,  an  average  nuclear  facility  draws  in,  an  open  loop  system,  like  a  billion 
gallons  of  water  a  day,  over  a  billion.  So  even  with  the  closed  loop,  you  are  still  talking  about  50 
million  to  1 00  million  of  gallons  a  day.  So  you  would  be  adding  to  the  amount  of  fish  that  are 
killed  at  that  facility.  So  you  must  consider  the  existing  damage  that  the  present  facility,  Salem  I 
and  II  causes,  and  adding  even  more  damage.  And  Salem  I  and  II  draws  in  three  billion  gallons 
of  water  a  day,  every  day.  And  it  kills  billions  of  fish.  And  the  EPA  has  estimates  on  how  much. 
And  I  have  a  paper  I  would  like  to  submit  as  data.  And  they  kill  350  million  age  one  equivalent 
fish.  In  other  words,  fish  that  would  have  grown  up  to  be  a  million,  I  mean,  one  year  old.  That  is 
how  they  generally  use  their  fish  kill  data;  they  call  it  age  one  equivalent  fish.  But,  actually,  the 
facility  kills  billions  of  fish,  billions  of  smaller  fish,  which  is  the  food  chain  for  the  bigger  fish,  and 
the  whole  ecosystem.  So  my  concern  here  is  that  you  want  to  build  a  new  facility,  but  you  are 
not  stopping  the  existing  damage  caused  by  the  present  facility  that  is  there,  units  I  and  II,  which 
draw  in  three  billion  gallons  of  water,  and  have  an  open  loop  cooling  system.  So  before  you 
consider  building  a  new  facility  you  should  stop  the  damage  caused  by  the  existing  facility,  first. 

I  think  that  is  a  priority.  But  it  seems  like  just  build  another  one.  But  you  still  have  an  existing 
fish  kill  facility,  there.  And  it  kills  all  species,  all  ages.  And  it  is  destroying  the  fishing  industry 
along  the  Delaware  Bay  and  the  Delaware  River.  We  used  to  have  a  great  fishing  industry,  and 
we  don't  now.  Not  when  one  facility  draws  in  three  billion  gallons  of  water  a  day.  And  Salem 
says  we  fixed  up  some  wetlands  and  that  will  compensate.  It  is  really  hard  to  believe  that  fixing 
up  a  few  acres  of  wetlands  will  compensate  for  billions  of  fish  killed,  every  year,  year  after  year. 
So  I  feel  that  you  should  fix  the  first  two,  units  Salem  I  and  II,  and  then  consider  moving  on.

Response:  Potential  effects  of  entrainment  and  impingement  on  fish  populations  will  be 
discussed  in  Sec.  5.3.2.  In  addition,  cumulative  impacts  of  all  facilities  will  be  discussed  in 
Chapter  7. 

Comment:  Although  the  water  volume  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  by  the  closed  cycle 
new  plant  is  substantially  lower,  there  will  still  be  impingement  and  entrainment  of  aquatic  life, 
as  well  as  potentially  significant  thermal  impacts  from  the  closed-cycle  cooling  system. 

Maximum  intake  of  the  new  plant  is  estimated  in  the  ER  to  be  equivalent  to  3.7  percent  of  the 
intake  flow  of  once-through  cooling  at  the  existing  Salem  facility.  However,  regarding  thermal 
discharge,  the  new  plant  discharge  is  located  within  the  region  already  influenced  by  the  thermal 
discharges  of  the  existing  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  facilities.  The  impact  of  this  situation  on 
thermal  plume  must  be  fully  and  rigorously  evaluated  in  the  EIS,  regardless  of  any  applicable 
mixing  zone.  (0018-16  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  Thermal  impacts  and  impacts  to  surface  water  as  a  result  of  plant  operations  will 
be  discussed  in  Sections  5.2.2. 7  and  5.2.4  of  the  EIS.  Potential  operational  impacts  to  aquatic 
life,  including  entrainment  and  impingement,  will  be  discussed  in  Section  5.3.2. 

Comment:  During  the  re-permitting  of  the  existing  nuclear  facilities  at  Salem,  PSEG  developed 
a  bay-wide  concept  of  mitigating  the  impacts  of  the  existing  cooler  apparatus  at  those  facilities. 
They  were  creative  in  identifying  a  variety  of  ways  that  the  bay-wide  resource  value  could  be 
improved  through  investment  in  projects,  throughout  the  Delaware  Bay  Estuary.  I  was  attracted 
by  the  scope  of  their  thinking,  and  the  resources  they  could  bring  to  the  table.  I  testified  in  favor 
of  this  mitigation  idea  at  the  repermitting  hearing.  (0001-10-5  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  Since  then  I  have  followed,  with  my  students,  and  with  great  interest,  what  has 
become  the  largest  estuarine  enhancement  project  in  the  world.  Without  going  into  any  details, 
the  project  has  been,  in  my  mind,  a  resounding  success  at  many  levels,  in  increasing  the 
resource  value  of  large  acreages  throughout  the  bay.  PSEG  has  a  solid  track  record  in 
delivering  on  their  commitment  to  bay-wide  health.  (0001-10-7  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  Returning,  finally,  to  the  purpose  of  this  hearing,  should  this  project  move  forward 
with  construction,  there  will  be  on-site  habitat  impacts  that  will  be  unavoidable.  I  urge  the 
process  to  embrace  the  same  bay-wide  approach  used  in  the  estuarine  enhancement  program, 
and  to  be  creative  and  aggressive,  in  identifying  off-site  mitigation  opportunity.  Hold  PSEG's 
feet  to  the  fire.  History  suggests  that  they  will  deliver.  (0001-10-9  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  The  company  had  the  foresight,  long  before  the  Estuarine  Restoration  Act  was 
passed,  with  the  goal  of  restoring  a  million  estuarine  acres,  including  many  wetlands,  in  the  U.S. 
by  the  year  2010.  Long  before  that  Act  was  passed,  and  the  guardian  of  that  act  became  two 
entities,  essentially,  Restore  America's  Estuaries,  a  practitioner  coalition  nation-wide.  Actually 
now  world-wide.  And  the  Community  Restoration  Center,  NOAA  Restoration  Center, 

Community  Based  Restoration  Center  which  has,  I  think,  a  collective  budget,  over  the  years, 
now  exceeding  28  million  dollars.  Before  that  became  in  the  public  venue,  and  popular, 
restoring  wetlands  is  a  good  thing,  and  we  needed  to  know  why,  of  course. 


NUREG-2168

Long  before  that  became  the  popular  trend,  the  company  PSEG  had  been  developing  this 
program  as  a  cost-effective  basis  for  offsetting  the  effects  of  the  power  plant,  with  respect  to  its 
take  of  fin  fish  and  shellfish.  And  the  goal  was  to  produce  enough  wetland  acreage,  or  to 
conserve  and  restore  enough  wetland  acreage,  to  produce  the  number  of  equivalent  adults  that 
would  be  lost  at  the  facility.  (0001-14-4  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Comment:  So  let  me  close  with  a  series  of  statistics,  if  I  may.  First  of  all,  as  Seagrant  Director, 
I  was  able  to  enter  into  a  public  private  partnership  with  the  company.  The  company  put  up 
750,000  dollars  over  five  years,  and  we  Seagrant  Directors,  in  1 1  states  around  the  nation, 
matched  those  funds,  to  do  some  of  the  basic  and  applied  research  to  understand  what  was 
going  on,  as  we  were  restoring  these  sites.  One  of  those  projects  funded  a  young  lady  by  the 
name  of  Kristen  Solenstal  at  Yale  University.  She  was  the  first  of  many  people  trying,  with  that 
funding,  to  demonstrate  that  the  variety  of  phragmites  that  we  call  bad  is  actually  an  introduced 
variety,  probably  from  either  Asia,  or  Europe,  or  probably  both. 

That  was  part  of  this  Marsh  Ecology  Research  Program,  or  the  MERP,  as  we  called  it.  All  of 
these  funds  were  parlayed  into  many  federal  grants.  For  example,  I  have  been  funded  by  the 
EPA,  by  NOAA,  several  agencies  within  NOAA,  ANS,  Solestol  Kennedy,  I  have  received  NSF 
funding.  All  as  part  of  the  programmatic  opportunity,  at  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program 
created  for  people  interested  in  understanding  how  to  do  this  restoration,  how  to  make  it 
effective,  and  why  it  actually  works. 

Two  contributions,  three  contributions  that  will  be  the  last  I  say.  Three  contributions  that  we 
made,  that  come  immediately  to  mind  is,  as  a  group,  the  scientists  involved  in  the  Estuary 
Enhancement  Program  developed  the  practitioner  skills,  or  methods,  for  restoring  wetlands. 
What  kinds  of  criteria  and  metrics  should  you  be  thinking  about,  when  you  go  in  to  restore  a 
site?  Those  metrics  have  been  fully  adopted  by  Restore  America's  Estuaries,  and  has  been 
published  as  a  public  document  by  them.  We  published  it,  of  course,  in  the  peer  reviewed 
literature,  on  our  own. 

Secondly,  one  of  the  toughest  things  to  do,  when  you  are  trying  to  look  at  these  restored  sites 
with  respect  to  the  returns  of  functions  and  processes,  as  opposed  to  the  structure  of  these 
sites,  it  is  relatively  easy  to  grow  grass.  I  apologize  to  my  friends  in  the  Corps.  But  you  are  the 
guys  that  told  me  to  keep  it  simple,  stupid.  We  can  defend  85  percent  survival  after  three  years 
in  court,  to  a  wetland  ecologist  that  means  absolutely  nothing,  other  than  you  are  pretty  good  at 
growing  grass,  which  I  guess  is  not  bad.  (0001-14-8  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Comment:  I  mention  that  we  are  able  to  employ  new,  really  state  of  the  art,  modeling  efforts, 
something  called  Echopath  and  Echosim,  if  any  of  you  are  familiar  with  it,  to  demonstrate,  once 
again,  that  the  increment  of  new  production,  one  is  measurable  against  background,  and  two,  it 
is  equated  with  the  goals  of  the  program.  This  is  one  of  the  most  important  projects  with  regard 
to  coastal  wetland  management,  and  coastal  management  in  general,  that  has  ever  been 
undertaken.

And  I,  personally,  applaud  the  foresight  of  the  company  to  do  something  like  this,  when  it  wasn't 
considered,  at  the  time,  best  management  practices.  And  whether  it  becomes  best 
management  practice,  regulatory  or  law,  or  otherwise  it  clearly  has  been.  (0001-14-10  [Weinstein,

Response:  These  comments  provide  general  information  in  support  of  the  application.  They 
do  not  provide  any  specific  information  related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed 
action  and  will  not  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS.  However,  mitigation  measures  related  to 
construction  and  operational  impacts  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2,  respectively. 

Comment:  Construction  of  a  new  nuclear  facility  and  access  road,  at  this  location,  will  result  in 
the  damage  of  wetlands,  and  adverse  effects  on  a  variety  of  aquatic  life,  bird  life,  and  wild  life. 
(0001-19-4  [Blake,  Matt]) 

Comment:  With  respect  to  restoration  of  wetlands,  it  has  been  common  knowledge,  for  a  long 
time,  that  wetlands  support  the  production  of  most  commercial  and  recreational  fin  fish  and 
shellfish  species,  that  we  all  enjoy  eating,  or  capturing,  or  both.  To  the  extent  that  you  can  find 
citations  in  the  literature,  Irand  and  Lacy,  for  example,  that  say  95  percent  of  all  commercial  and 
recreational  species  produced,  marine  species  produced  in  the  United  States,  require  wetlands 
as  essential  habitats  during  their  first  year  of  life.  (0001-14-2  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Comment:  We  have  been  able  to  demonstrate,  given  the  extreme  variability  around  any  mean 
you  calculate,  in  these  sites,  in  terms  of  processes  and  functions,  that  the  20  plus  thousand 
acres  produced  a  new  increment  of  secondary  production  of  these  fin  fish  and  shellfish  that 
exceeded  the  loss,  again  as  I  said  before,  of  equivalent  adults.  Also  we  have  been  able  to 
document,  everybody  says  phragmites  is  bad,  and  we  suspected  for  a  long  time  that  it  had  to  do 
with  habitat,  and  other  functional  processes. 

Some  of  our  research  has  now  demonstrated  that  a  fish  growing  up  in  a  phragmites  dominated 
marsh,  whatever  the  combination  of  factors  is,  and  I  should  say  to  you,  much  to  the  company's 
chagrin,  I  was  able  with  my  colleagues  to  demonstrate  that  carbon  nitrogen  nutrients  from 
phragmites  is,  indeed,  finding  its  way  into  this  fish. 

But  the  quality  of  the  animal,  the  end  of  the  growing  season,  falls  short  of  the  quality  of  an 
animal  in  a  naturally  cord  grass  dominated  marsh.  In  other  words,  they  can't  put  down  the 
energy  reserves,  for  migration  and  overwintering,  if  they  grow  up  in  a  phragmites  marsh.

Response:  Potential  impacts  as  a  result  of  construction  and  operation  on  wetlands  and  their 
associated  aquatic  life  and  wildlife  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2. 

Comment:  The  natural  systems  of  the  Delaware  River  and  estuary  are  critical  environments, 
with  major  significance  for  both  regional  and  global  biodiversity,  for  regional  water  supply,  and 
water  quality,  and  for  supporting  important  environmental  activities.  Construction  on  the  scale 
proposed  by  PSEG,  on  the  Delaware  coast,  requires  careful  consideration  of  environmental 
factors.  (0001-4-2  [Velinsky,  David])

Response:  Potential  construction  impacts  on  aquatic  systems  associated  with  the  Delaware 
coasts  (Delaware  River,  associated  wetland  systems)  will  be  discussed  in  Section  4.3.2 

Comment:  Before  addressing  the  new  construction,  I  would  like  to  point  out  PSEG's  past 
efforts  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  its  operations  on  the  aquatic  environment  in  the  vicinity.  In 
particular,  faced  with  concerns  of  negative  impacts  on  fisheries,  by  cooling  water  intake 
operations,  PSEG  responded  with  the  largest  private  wetlands  restoration  project  in  the  world. 

The  Estuary  and  Enhancement  program  began  in  1994,  and  since  that  time  has  had  large  scale 
efforts  to  restore  and  preserve  portions  of  the  Delaware  River  estuary,  in  both  New  Jersey  and 
Delaware.  It  has  restored,  enhanced  and/or  preserved  more  than  20,000  acres  of  salt  marsh, 
and  adjacent  uplands  to  vital,  healthy  habitat  for  fish  and  wildlife.  (0001-4-4  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  information  in  support  of  the  application.  It  does 
not  provide  any  specific  information  related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action 
and  will  not  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS.  Mitigative  actions,  however,  resulting  from  any 
construction  and/or  operational  effects  on  aquatic  environments  in  the  vicinity  of  the  proposed 
site  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2 

Comment:  In  addition  to  the  steps  being  taken  to  protect  wetlands  impacted  by  the 
construction,  the  aquatic  impacts  of  the  proposed  facility  will  be  limited  by  the  use  of  a  closed- 
cycle  cooling  system.  Compared  to  the  once  through  system,  these  cooling  towers  will  divert 
much  less  water  for  cooling.  Projected  maximum  diversion,  for  the  new  facility,  is  less  than 
four  percent,  depending  on  the  type  of  facility  of  the  current  use  by  Salem,  and  is  less  than 
.05  percent  of  the  total  volume  of  the  Delaware  flow.  As  a  result,  the  impingement  on  fish 
population  will  be  a  small  fraction  of  the  current  levels  at  the  Salem  station.  (0001-4-6  [Velinsky,

Comment:  After  reviewing  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program,  by  PSEG,  I'm  impressed  by 
their  innovative  mitigation  measures,  such  as  wetland  restoration,  phragmites  control,  fish 
protection  at  the  nuclear  sites,  restoration  of  anadromous  fish  migration,  through  fish  ladders, 
research,  et  cetera.  These  programs  have  resulted  in  long  lasting  benefits  for  the  saltwater 
estuary,  including  expanded  biological  diversity  and  habitats,  breeding  areas,  food  sources  for 
aquatic,  terrestrial,  and  avian  species,  especially  threatened  and  endangered  species,  and 
better  water  quality.  This  leads  me  to  believe  that  PSEG  will  do  an  excellent  job  of  mitigation  in 
the  future.  (0001-7-12  [Eastman,  Ajax])

Comment:  In  reviewing  the  PSEG  Early  Site  Permit  application,  and  Environmental  Report 
filed  on  May  25th,  2010,  we  noted  that  the  new  units  intake  and  cooling  systems  will  be 
designed  to  minimize  the  impact  to  the  aquatic  community,  by  utilizing  cooling  towers,  and  an 
intake  system  and  design  flows  that  conform  to  best  available  technology  as  required  under 
Section  31 6B  of  the  Clean  Water  Act.  The  cooling  tower  blow-down  discharge  should  have  little 
impact  on  the  Delaware  River,  at  this  location,  or  significantly  elevate  river  water  temperatures.

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  information  in  support  of  the  application.  It  does 
not  provide  any  specific  information  related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action 
and  will  not  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS.  Any  potential  operational  impacts,  however,  related  to  the 
operation  of  the  cooling  system  will  be  addressed  in  Section  5.3.2. 

Comment:  Much  of  the  needed  science,  on  the  Early  Site  Permit  should  be,  really,  right  at 
hand,  since  this  is  a  contiguous  site  that  is  being  proposed.  Their  track  record  has  been  good. 

I,  personally,  have  observed  the  impingement  and  entrainment  process,  since  I  also  teach 
fishery  science,  and  fishery  research,  and  have  had  an  opportunity  to  testify  as  to  the  value,  not 
only  the  impingement  and  entrainment  process,  but  also  the  continued  elevation  of  new 
technology,  as  it  came  on  the  scene.  (0001-9-3  [Lacandro,  Roger]) 

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  information  in  support  of  the  application,  it  does

entrainment  and  impingement  however :  will  be  discussed  in  Section  5.3.2. 

Comment:  A  new  plant  will  provide  an  excellent  opportunity  to  incorporate  new  technology, 
hopefully  to  produce  cleaner,  safer  energy,  and  especially  if  a  cooling  tower  is  incorporated  into 
the  new  plans.  I'm  familiar  with  the  impingement  and  entrainment,  as  I  said.  The  much  reduced 
need  for  water  in  a  cooling  tower  process,  you  know,  will  reduce  much  of  that  impact, 
considerably.  I  know  of  no  scientific  study  that  proves  that  the  present  cooling  processes,  at 
Salem  and  Hope  Creek  has  generated  any  impact  on  the  estuary.  It  can  be  debated,  it  can  be 
argued.  But  I  have  not  seen  a  scientific  study  that  really  proves  that  fact.  After  reviewing  the 
EPS  [ESP]  request,  I  find  no  reason  to  deny  the  requested  permit.  (0001-9-5  [Lacandro,  Roger])

impingement  and  entrainment  will  be  evaluated  in  Section  5.3.2. 

Comment:  And  I  know  that  one  of  the  potential  or  likely  environmental  impacts  has  to  do  with 
wetlands,  the  proposed  construction  of  this  facility.  I  have  to  tell  you  that  I'm  very  comfortable 
with  PSEG  dealing  with  the  challenges  of  mitigating  impacts  on  wetlands  and,  actually,  their 
commitment  to  restoring  wetlands.  They  have  been  involved  with,  perhaps,  one  of  the  largest 
estuarine  restoration  programs  in  the  country,  20,000  acres  of  wetlands  restored  in  Delaware 
Bay,  the  River,  and  the  estuary,  and  it  has  led  to  increased  production  of  fin  fish  and  shell  fish. 
So  there  are,  like,  wetland  impacts.  But  I  think  the  company  is  certainly  up  to  the  challenge  of 
mitigating  those.  (0002-4-3  [DeLuca,  Mike])

development,  and  energy  facilities,  in  particular,  is  that  on  fin  fish  and  shell  fish.  And  I  do  note 
that  the  application  does  call  for  construction  of  a  cooling  tower  which  is,  you  know,  one  of  the 
ideal  strategies  for  mitigating  harm  to  fin  fish  and  shell  fish,  particularly  their  eggs  and  larvae. 
There  are,  also,  thermal  impacts  that  are  mitigated  by  this  particular  design  component.

Comment:  I  would  just  like  to  mention  two  areas  of  potential  interest  if,  indeed,  there  is  some 
broader  consideration  of  mitigation  strategies.  And  that  is  a  lot  of  work  has  been  underway  in 
the  Delaware  estuary  to  restore  two  signature  species,  the  oyster  and  sturgeon.  Oysters  are  on 
the  rebound.  They  have  beset  by  disease,  and  overharvesting,  for  years.  And  today  we 
actually  enjoy  a  modest  harvest.  I  don't  believe  the  expansion  of  this  proposed  plant  will 
endanger  that  critter.  But,  perhaps,  there  are  some  opportunities  to  enhance  the  restoration  of 
that  particular  species.  And,  similarly,  with  sturgeon.  South  Jersey  used  to  be  the  caviar  capital 
of  the  world,  at  the  turn  of  the  last  century.  Sturgeon  have  been  just  listed  as  endangered  by 
the  federal  government.  There  are  efforts,  under  way,  to  study  their  habitat  use,  their  habits, 
and  their  spawning  grounds.  And,  again,  I  think  this  is  fertile  area  to  explore  in  terms  of  some 
broader  restoration  strategies  that  might  be  considered  down  the  road.  (0002-4-6  [DeLuca,  Mike])

Comment:  The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  has  done  a  phenomenal  job  of  creating 
substantial  new  areas  of  high  quality  wetland  habitat,  which  very  definitely  has  an  impact  on,  in 
particular,  juveniles  of  a  wide  variety  of  aquatic  species,  and  nutrient  flow,  in  the  area.  And  it, 
really,  is  a  phenomenal  laboratory  at  this  point  for  understanding  the  importance  of,  and  the 
development  of,  those  types  of  habitats.  Most  of  those  habitats  were  much  less  productive  prior 
to  the  work  that  PSEG  engaged  in,  having  been  really  run  over  by  exotic  phragmites.  That 
made  them  much  less  valuable  as  natural  systems  than  they  are  today.  (0002-5-2  [Duvall,  Brian])

Comment:  And  the  Salem  PSEG,  they  have  a  nice  new  facility  over  there,  they  have  a  display 
on  the  environment,  and  they  have  a  nice  little  window,  outside.  But  to  be  truly  environmentally 
concerned,  you  would  go  through  and  stop  the  fish  kill  caused  by  your  facility.  To  be  a 
responsible  member  of  society,  and  to  stop  that  damage  at  your  existing  facilities.  And  the 
moral  code,  and  the  principle  we  should  all  live  by,  is  that  if  something  is  causing  harm,  it  should 
be  stopped.  And  if  you  look  at  it  in  that  basic  principle,  then  they  should  stop  killing  the  fish  at 
Salem  I  and  II.  It  is  destroying  the  fishing  industry,  so  you  are  losing  jobs.  (0002-6-13  [Schneider,

Response:  Any  potential  impacts  on  aquatic  resources  due  to  construction  and/or  operation  of 
this  facility  will  be  discussed  in  EIS  sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2. 

Comment:  And  I  spoke  with  some  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  people  tonight.  And  I  have 
a  major  concern,  that  when  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  does  an  evaluation  of  an 
existing  permit,  or  a  new  permit,  the  issue  of  water  intake,  for  the  cooling  system,  is  left  up  to 
the  state,  as  a  state  permit.  I  spoke  with  a  gentleman  from  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission, 
and  he  says  it  is  above  his  ability  to  change  the  rulings,  that  the  EPA  has  made  about  this  issue. 
But  I  feel  that  it  should  be  part  of  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission's  when  they  evaluate  the 
water  intake,  for  two  reasons.  Because  NRC  is  a  nuclear,  is  a  federal  agency.  A  federal 
agency  applies  to  any  issue  that  affects  more  than  one  state.  The  fish  kill  caused  by  these 
facilities  affects  more  than  one  state,  it  affects  the  fishermen  in  Delaware,  in  Maryland,  in 
Pennsylvania,  in  New  Jersey,  and  all  up  and  down  the  coast,  where  the  fish  would  have  gone, 
and  traveled,  and  be  caught  by  other  people.  So  therefore  the  NRC  needs  to  be  involved  with  a 
federal  ruling  on  it,  and  not  be  involved  with  the  water  permit.  So  I'm  asking  the  NRC  to  talk  to 
the  people  above  them  to  pursue  that.  (0002-6-18  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Response:  The  NRC's  regulatory  authority  includes  providing  for  the  adequate  protection  of 
public  health  and  safety  and  the  common  defense  and  security,  as  defined  by  the  Atomic 
Energy  Act.  The  NRC  does  not  possess  authority  to  act  with  respect  to  an  issue  simply 
because  it  involves  an  interstate  matter.  Pursuant  to  NEPA,  however,  the  NRC  does  examine 
the  reasonably  foreseeable  environmental  impacts  attributable  to  a  proposed  licensing  action 
regardless  of  state  lines.  Subsequently,  any  potential  impacts  on  aquatic  resources  due  to 
construction  and/or  operation  of  this  facility  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2. 

Comment:  And  then,  also,  the  Federal  Clean  Water  Act  applies  to  the  fish  kill.  In  the  1970s 
the  Federal  Clean  Water  Act,  said  that  you  must  use  the  best  technology  available  to  stop  the 
fish  kill.  This  facility,  Salem  I  and  II,  is  killing  the  fish.  And  they  are  not  using  the  best  available 
technology.  So,  therefore,  the  federal  agency  overseeing  the  nuclear  plant,  which  is  the  NRC, 
needs  to  enforce  that  particular  law.  It  is  a  federal  law,  the  Clean  Water  Act.  So,  again,  I  ask 
the  NRC  to  pursue  having  open  or  closed  loop  systems.  (0002-6-20  [Schneider,  Richard])

impact  of  large  quantities  of  elevated  temperature  water  reentering  the  estuary.  [I  know  of  no 
scientific  study  that  proves  that  the  present  cooling  process  at  Salem  has  had  a  negative  impact 
on  the  estuary.]  (0008-6  [Lacandro,  Roger])

entrainment,  impingement,  and  thermal  discharges  on  aquatic  resources,  however,  will  be 
discussed  in  Section  5.3.2. 

Comment:  During  the  re-permitting  of  the  existing  nuclear  facilities  at  Salem,  PSE&G 
developed  a  bay-wide  concept  of  mitigating  the  impacts  of  the  existing  cooling  apparatus  at  the 
facilities.  They  were  creative  in  identifying  a  variety  of  ways  that  the  bay-wide  resource  value 
could  be  improved  through  investment  in  projects  throughout  the  Delaware  Bay  estuary.  I  was 
attracted  by  the  scope  of  their  thinking  and  the  resources  they  could  bring  to  the  table.  I 
testified  in  favor  of  this  mitigation  idea  at  the  re-permitting  hearings. 

Since  then  I  have  followed,  with  my  students  and  with  great  interest,  what  has  become  the 
largest  Estuarine  Enhancement  project  in  the  world.  Without  going  into  details,  the  project  has 
been  a  resounding  success  at  many  levels  in  increasing  the  resource  value  of  large  acreages 
throughout  the  Bay.  PSE&G  has  a  solid  track  record  in  delivering  on  their  commitment  to 
baywide  health.  (0010-5  [Applegate,  Jim])

Comment:  Returning  to  the  purpose  of  this  hearing.  Should  this  project  move  ahead  toward 
construction,  there  will  be  on-site  habitat  impacts  that  will  be  unavoidable.  I  urge  the  process  to 
embrace  the  same  baywide  approach  used  in  the  Estuarine  Enhancement  program,  and  to  be 
creative  and  aggressive  in  identifying  off  site  mitigation  opportunities.  (0010-7  [Applegate,  Jim])

flows  that  conform  to  Best  Available  Technology  as  required  by  Section  316(b)  of  the  Clean 
Water  Act.  The  cooling  tower  blowdown  discharge  should  have  little  effect  on  the  Delaware

resources,  however,  will  be  evaluated  in  Section  5.3.2. 

Comment:  The  Environmental  Report  indicates  an  overall  wetlands  impact  of  229  acres  from 
the  new  plant  and  proposed  causeway.  It  is  further  indicated  there  is  an  abundance  of  wetlands 
in  the  vicinity  totaling  more  than  25,000  acres  and  the  quality  of  the  dominant  species  is 
invasive  Phragmites.  Additional  lands  targeted  for  acquisition  through  a  land  right  exchange  to 
the  north  of  the  site  are  part  of  an  existing  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  Confined  Disposal  Facility 
area  (CDF)  that  is  surrounded  by  dikes  and  not  open  to  tides.  PSEG  would  reduce 
environmental  impacts  by  placing  permanent  facilities  inside  these  diked  areas.  In 
compensation  for  use  of  these  wetlands  we  would  recommend  that  PSEG  create  or  restore 
degraded  wetlands  within  the  Delaware  Bay  region  at  an  appropriate  compensation  ratio.  This 
should  be  an  achievable  undertaking  by  PSEG  as  their  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  has 
been  recognized  nationally  for  restoring  and  protecting  over  20,000  acres  of  wetlands  and 
adjoining  properties  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  in  both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  (0011-12

construction  and/or  operational  effects  on  wetlands  and  aquatic  resources  will  be  discussed  in 
Sections  4. 3. 2  and  5. 3. 2. 

Comment:  In  addition,  I  urge  that  the  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  alternative  energy 
generating  sources  be  included  in  the  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (EIS)  in  order  to  show 
that  by  comparison  nuclear  energy  is  a  far  preferable  option.  (0012-2  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Response:  Cumulative  ecological  impacts  and  alternative  energy  sources  will  be  discussed  in

Comment:  After  reviewing  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  by  PSEG,  I  am  impressed  by 
their  innovative  mitigation  measures  such  as  wetland  restoration,  phragmites  control,  fish 
protection  at  the  reactor  sites,  restoration  of  anadromous  fish  migration  through  fish  ladders,

construction  and/or  operational  effects  on  wetlands  and  aguatic  resources  will  be  evaluated  in 
Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2. 

Comment:  Before  addressing  the  new  construction,  I  would  point  out  PSEG’s  past  efforts  to 
mitigate  the  effects  of  its  operations  on  the  aquatic  environment  in  the  Salem  vicinity.  In 
particular,  faced  with  concerns  of  negative  impacts  on  fisheries  by  cooling  water  intake 
operations,  PSEG  responded  with  the  largest  private  wetlands  restoration  project  in  the  world. 
The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  began  in  1994  and  since  that  time  has  been  a  large  scale 
effort  to  restore  and  preserve  portions  of  the  Delaware  Estuary  in  both  New  Jersey  and 
Delaware.  PSEG  has  restored,  enhanced,  and/or  preserved  more  than  20,000  acres  of  salt 
marsh  and  adjacent  uplands  to  vital,  healthy  habitat  for  fish  and  wildlife. 

Restoration  efforts  have  included  the  goal  of  replacing  former  salt  hay  farms  and  marshes 
dominated  by  invasive  Phragmites  australis  with  salt  cord  grass-dominated  marsh.  The 
Academy  has  studied  many  of  these  sites  prior  to  restoration  and  visited  a  number  afterwards. 
The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  has  been  successful  in  restoring  typical  salt  marsh 
conditions  at  the  sites,  with  most  sites  meeting  targets  for  reduction  in  Phragmites  and 
establishment  of  salt  cordgrass.  Many  of  these  and  related  studies  have  been  published  in 
various  peer-reviewed  scientific  journals.  (0014-4  [Velinsky,  David])

Comment:  In  looking  at  the  proposed  new  construction  on  the  PSEG  Site,  I  will  be  speaking 
primarily  to  specific  projected  ecological  impacts  on  local  aquatic  systems.  The  natural  systems 
of  Delaware  River  and  Estuary  are  critical  environments  with  major  significance  for  both  regional 
and  global  biodiversity,  for  regional  water  supply  and  water  quality,  and  for  supporting  important 
economic  activities.  Construction  on  the  scale  proposed  by  PSEG  on  the  Delaware  coast 
requires  careful  consideration  of  environmental  factors.  (0014-2  [Velinsky,  David])

of  the  Delaware  Bay  ecosystem  will  be  evaluated  in  Section  4.3.2.

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  information  in  support  of  the  application.  It  does 
not  provide  any  specific  information  related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action 
and  will  not  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS.  Mitigative  actions,  however,  resulting  from  any 
construction  and/or  operational  effects  on  the  aquatic  resources  of  wetland  ecosystems  will  be 
discussed  in  Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2. 

Comment:  The  proposed  new  construction  will  permanently  impact  approximately  229  acres  of 
wetland.  While  protection  of  wetland  is  a  high  national  priority  (as  demonstrated  by  Section  404 
of  the  Clean  Water  Act),  the  majority  of  the  wetland  acreage  impacted  by  the  new  construction 
has  a  degraded  hydroperiod  and  now  hosts  a  monoculture  of  Phragmites  australis.  An  invasive 
reed  grass,  Phragmites  is  often  found  in  disturbed  marsh  areas,  where  plant  communities, 
hydrology  and  topography  have  been  altered.  Phragmites  displaces  native  plants  and  has  a 
negative  impact  on  biodiversity.  Targeting  these  degraded  wetlands  in  close  proximity  to 
existing  PSEG  facilities  will  reduce  the  need  for  new  infrastructure,  minimizing  the 
environmental  disturbance  that  would  result  if  development  occurred  in  “Greenfield”  sites. 
Moreover,  the  amount  of  wetlands  impacted  represents  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  wetland  - 
many  with  higher  quality  functions  -  present  in  the  vicinity  of  the  construction. 

In  addition,  85  acres  of  the  wetland  being  permanently  altered  by  the  construction  are  located  in 
the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  Combined  Disposal  Facility  (CDF.)  This  has  been  the  site  for 
dumping  of  dredge  spoils  from  deepening  of  the  Delaware  River  Channel.  It  is  surrounded  by 
dikes  and  is  not  open  to  tidal  influences.  It  is  unlikely  that  this  site  supports  high  level  wetland 
functions  and  utilizing  it  where  permanent  construction  is  necessary  will  limit  overall  wetland 
impacts.  (0014-6  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  Impacts  as  a  result  of  construction  including  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  will  be 
discussed  in  Section  4. 3.  of  the  EIS.  Mitigative  actions,  proposed  by  the  applicant,  as  a  result 
from  any  construction  effects  on  aquatic  resources  will  be  addressed  in  Section  4.3.2.  In 
addition,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers-Philadelphia  District  is  a  Cooperating  Agency  on 
the  EIS  for  PSEG's  ESP  application.  As  such,  the  environmental  impacts  of  any  actions

proposed  by  the  Corps  to  facilitate  PSEG's  ESP  application,  including  the  land  exchange  and 
relocation  of  the  confined  disposal  facility,  will  be  discussed  in  EIS. 

Comment:  PSEG  is  making  acceptable  efforts  to  restrict  impact  on  these  wetlands,  including  a 
site  plan  to  minimize  encroachment,  the  use  of  sediments  pits  to  stage  some  of  the  construction 
operations,  and  the  use  of  a  raised  causeway  rather  than  using  fill  material  to  carry  the  access 
road  to  the  new  site.  Where  permanent  disturbance  to  wetland  occurs,  PSEG  has  outlined  a 
mitigation  plan  that  should  create  new  wetland  environments  in  adequate  amounts  to  offset  any 
loss.  We  anticipate  that  the  resources  and  expertise  developed  in  the  EEP  will  provide  a 
foundation  for  the  mitigation  steps  being  taken  by  PSEG  in  the  new  site  construction,  both  in 
selecting  the  mitigation  sites  and  in  managing  the  restored  and  enhanced  wetland  sites.  (0014-8 
[Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  information  in  support  of  the  application.  It  does 
not  provide  any  specific  information  related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action 
and  will  not  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS.  Mitigative  actions,  however,  resulting  from  any 
construction  effects  on  wetlands  will  be  evaluated  in  Section  4.3.2. 

Comment:  The  basic  restoration  activities  developed  by  the  EEP,  particularly  controlling 
Phragmites  and  fostering  development  of  good  tidal  marsh  topography  and  hydrology,  have 
advanced  the  field  of  ecological  restoration.  The  ecological  engineering  technique  of  forming 
primary  channels  and  using  estuarine  processes  to  further  develop  channels  and  topography  is 
especially  notable.  As  such,  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  has  provides  an  important 
model  for  marshland  restoration  which  is  an  important  component  of  PSEG’s  proposed 
mitigation  plan.  (0014-10  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  information  in  support  of  the  application.  It  does 
not  provide  any  specific  information  related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action 
and  will  not  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS.  Mitigative  actions,  however,  resulting  from  any 
construction  and/or  operational  effects  on  wetlands  and  tidal  marshes  will  be  discussed  in 
Sections  4. 3. 2  and  5. 3. 2. 

Comment:  Therefore,  DRN  urges  NRC  to  review  certain  issues  in  more  detail,  including: 
clearer  evaluation  of  PSEG's  use  of  the  Army  Corps  confined  disposal  facility,  and  cumulative 
impacts  resulting  from  use  of  that  site;  water  impacts  including  dredging  and  construction 
impacts;  filling  of  wetlands;  floodplain  impacts;  habitat  impacts  and  impacts  to  species, 
especially  Atlantic  sturgeon;  and  impacts  and  evaluation  of  alternatives  for  cooling  systems. 
(0018-4  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers-Philadelphia  District  is  a  Cooperating  Agency 
on  the  EIS  for  PSEG's  ESP  application.  As  such,  the  environmental  impacts  of  any  actions 
proposed  by  the  Corps  to  facilitate  PSEG's  ESP  application,  including  the  land  exchange  and 
relocation  of  the  confined  disposal  facility,  will  be  discussed  in  EIS.  Potential  cumulative 
impacts  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  project  will  be  evaluated  in  Chapter  7. 

Comment:  Impacts  to  habitat  and  important  aquatic  species  must  also  be  rigorously  evaluated 
in  the  EIS.  In  particular,  DRN  is  concerned  with  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  Atlantic  sturgeon. 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Appendix  D 


The  ER  acknowledges  that  appropriate  habitat  for  juvenile  Atlantic  sturgeon  exists  in  the  project 
area,  that  direct  impacts  to  Atlantic  sturgeon  could  include  exposure  to  fine  sediments,  or 
collisions  with  propellers  or  water  borne  equipment,  and  that  "dredging  activities  will  likely 
displace  this  and  other  fish  from  the  immediate  dredge  zone." 

Since  the  preparation  of  the  ER,  NOAA's  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  issued  a 
proposed  rule  (October  6,  2010)  to  list  five  distinct  population  segments  (DPS)  of  the  Atlantic 
sturgeon  as  threatened  or  endangered  under  the  Endangered  Species  Act  (ESA).  In 
recognition  of  the  many  threats  to  riverine  habitat,  including  dredging,  filling,  and  degraded 
water  quality,  facing  Atlantic  sturgeon  in  the  Hudson  and  Delaware  Rivers,  NMFS  proposed  to 
list  a  DPS  consisting  of  these  populations,  the  New  York  Bight  (NYB)  DPS,  as  endangered. 

See,  75  Fed.  Reg.  61 ,872  at  61 ,881(Oct.  6,2010).  We  also  note  with  alarm  that  the  Delaware 
River  population  of  Atlantic  sturgeon  is  more  precariously  poised  than  the  Hudson  River 
population,  according  to  research  on  the  record.  According  to  the  Delaware  River  State  of  the 
Basin  Report,  2008,  which  is  based  on  science  collected  in  the  region,  the  status  of  the  Atlantic 
Sturgeon  is  considered  "poor  and  getting  worse"  with  numbers  "estimated  to  be  less  than  1,000 
and  probably  less  than  100  across  the  Estuary.”  Furthermore,  there  is  scientific  evidence  that 
the  Delaware  River  is  home  to  a  genetically  unique  population  of  Atlantic  Sturgeon,  and  that  this 
small  but  distinct  population  is  currently  reproducing.  That  the  Delaware  River  population  is  not 
only  genetically  unique  but  also  may  have  a  population  of  fewer  than  1 00  fish  makes  protection 
of  this  portion  of  the  NYB  DPS  a  critical  priority. 

This  change  in  status  means  that  a  critical  piece  of  information  is  missing  from  the  ER,  and 
must  be  evaluated  fresh  in  NRC's  creation  of  the  EIS.  (0018-13  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  of  construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  facility  as  they 
relate  to  threatened  or  endangered  species  such  as  the  Atlantic  sturgeon  will  be  evaluated  in 
Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2. 

Comment:  Although  the  water  volume  withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  by  the  closed  cycle 
new  plant  is  substantially  lower,  there  will  still  be  impingement  and  entrainment  of  aquatic  life, 
as  well  as  potentially  significant  thermal  impacts  from  the  closed-cycle  cooling  system. 

Maximum  intake  of  the  new  plant  is  estimated  in  the  ER  to  be  equivalent  to  3.7  percent  of  the 
intake  flow  of  once-through  cooling  at  the  existing  Salem  facility.  However,  regarding  thermal 
discharge,  the  new  plant  discharge  is  located  within  the  region  already  influenced  by  the  thermal 
discharges  of  the  existing  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  facilities.  The  impact  of  this  situation  on 
thermal  plume  must  be  fully  and  rigorously  evaluated  in  the  EIS,  regardless  of  any  applicable 
mixing  zone.  (0018-17  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Comment:  In  addition  to  the  steps  being  taken  to  protect  the  wetlands  impacted  by 
construction,  the  aquatic  impacts  of  the  proposed  facility  will  be  limited  by  the  use  of  a  closed 
cycle  cooling  system.  Compared  to  a  once-through  system,  these  cooling  towers  will  divert 
much  less  water  for  cooling.  Projected  maximum  diversion  for  the  new  facility  is  less  than  4%  of 
the  current  amount  used  by  the  Salem  Generating  Station  and  is  a  very  small  fraction  the  total 
volume  of  the  Delaware  River  flow.  As  a  result,  impingement  of  fish  populations  will  be  a  small 
fraction-less  than  3%  of  the  current  level  of  the  Salem  station.

Because  of  the  dosed  cooling  system,  we  would  also  expect  the  thermal  plume  of  the  new  plant 
to  be  localized  and  relatively  small,  with  no  significant  impact  on  the  local  aquatic  biota.  The 
conclusion  is  based  on  past  studies  of  the  impact  of  thermal  plumes  from  the  existing  PSEG 
generating  plants,  the  expected  operation  of  the  proposed  cooling  structures,  and  our 
understanding  of  the  ecology  of  aquatic  species  in  the  vicinity  of  the  plant.  (0014-12  [Velinsky, 
David]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  related  to  entrainment,  impingement,  and  thermal  discharges  of 
the  proposed  facility  on  aguatic  resources  will  be  discussed  in  Section  5.3.2  of  the  EIS.  Also, 
potential  cumulative  impacts  due  to  operation  of  the  closed-cycle  cooling  system  will  be 
addressed  in  Chapter  7. 

Comment:  Clearly,  the  EIS  will  need  to  address  the  impact  of  dredging  and  related  shoreline 
disturbance  and  take  all  viable  alternatives  into  account.  (0018-21  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  of  construction  activities  such  as  dredging  and  shoreline 
disturbances  will  be  evaluated  in  Section  4.3.2  of  the  EIS.  In  addition,  alternatives  will  be 
discussed  in  Chapter  9. 

Comment:  The  New  Jersey  Division  of  Fish  &  Wildlife  (DFW)  continues  to  be  concerned  with 
the  issue  of  impingement  and  entrainment  of  the  eggs,  larval  forms,  juveniles  and  adults  of  the 
fish,  shellfish  and  other  invertebrate  species  which  exist  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Six 
species  of  invertebrates  occurring  near  the  PSEG  Site  have  been  harvested  commercially  in  NJ 
to  include  -blue  crab,  eastern  oyster  and  other  shellfish. 

Environmental  Report,  CHAPTER  6,  ENVIRONMENTAL  MEASUREMENTS  AND 
MONITORING  PROGRAMS,  6. 5. 3. 2  Aquatic  Ecology  -includes  proposals  for  monitoring 
programs  to  include  impingement  sampling  and  entrainment  sampling  at  the  new  intake  for  fish 
and  shellfish  species. 

At  present  the  1995  -2009  BIOLOGICAL  MONITORING  PROGRAM  ANNUAL  REPORT; 
include  data  on  finfish  and  blue  crabs.  The  DFW  feels  that  data  on  shellfish  should  be  included 
in  this  report  and  in  the  pre-application,  construction,  pre-operational  and  operational 
monitoring. 

The  possible  additional  withdrawal  of  78,196  gpm  from  the  Delaware  River  for  the  CWS  and 
SWS  only  adds  to  the  existing  concerns  the  DFW  has  for  the  impingement  and  entrainment  of 
the  eggs,  larval  forms,  juveniles  and  adults  of  the  fish,  shellfish  and  other  invertebrate  species 
which  exist  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  (0019-23  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Potential  operational  impacts  such  as  entrainment  and  impingement  on  aquatic 
organisms  will  be  discussed  in  Section  5.3.2  and  the  potential  cumulative  effects  of  all  facilities 
operating  at  the  Salem-Hope  Creek  site  will  be  evaluated  in  Chapter  7. 

Comment:  General  Comments 

The  permittee  included  various  estimates  of  projected  impingement  and  entrainment  values  for 
the  proposed  system.  Impingement  and  entrainment  can  be  assessed  by  a  wide  variety  of  tools

and  it  is  not  possible  to  comment  on  the  accuracy  of  these  estimates  without  understanding 
more  regarding  the  underlying  assumptions.  However,  as  noted  above,  the  Department 
supports  the  use  of  closed  cycle  cooling  as  best  technology  available  to  minimize  water 
withdrawal  rates. 

The  Department  recognizes  that  the  proposed  closed  cycle  cooling  system  using  cooling  towers 
and  a  low  intake  velocity  of  less  than  0.5  feet  per  second  constitutes  the  best  technology 
available  for  minimizing  impingement  and  entrainment  impacts  under  Section  316(b)  of  the 
Clean  Water  Act.  (0019-25  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  information  in  support  of  the  application.  It  does 
not  provide  any  specific  information  related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action 
and  will  not  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS.  Any  potential  impacts,  however,  related  to  entrainment  and 
impingement  will  be  discussed  in  Section  5.3.2. 

Comment:  B  -  The  ESPA  includes  only  a  cursory  and  simplistic  evaluation  of  the  potential 
impacts  to  the  aquatic  ecosystem  (water  quality,  biota,  wetlands,  etc.)  that  could  result  from  the 
construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  project  (Chapter  3  of  the  Environmental  Report). 
Likewise,  measures  to  mitigate  such  impacts  are  described  in  only  a  general  manner.  In 
general,  the  detailed  evaluation  of  potential  impacts  is  relegated  to  future  permit  and  other 
approval  actions.  (0020-3  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  on  aguatic  ecosystems  due  to  construction  and/or  operation  of 
the  proposed  facility  and  mitigation  of  such  potential  impacts  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3.2 
and  5.3.2  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  (8)  ER  Section  4. 1.2. 2,  page  4.1-7:  indicates  that  dredged  material  from  the 
USACE  Artificial  Island  CDF  and  from  dredging  activities  associated  with  the  intake  and  barge 
facility  areas  would  be  used  as  fill  material  on-site. 

At  a  May  9,  2010  meeting  with  the  NJDEP,  PSEG  representatives  indicated  that  dredging  of 
-975,000  cubic  yards  of  sediments  from  the  Delaware  River  would  be  needed  to  support  the 
project  -  this  has  apparently  been  reduced  to  -  590,000  CY  (see  Comment  #9).  All  dredging 
and  dredged  material  management  activities  associated  with  the  construction  of  the  proposed 
project  must  be  described  and  comprehensively  evaluated.  This  would  include  testing  of 
dredged  material  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the  1997  NJDEP  Dredging  Technical 
Manual.  The  documents  submitted  in  support  of  the  ESPA  barely  discuss  dredging  and 
dredged  material  aspects  of  the  proposed  project.  Section  2.3.1  of  the  Environmental  Report 
only  briefly  summarizes  some  Delaware  River  sediment  samples  collected  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
project  site  and  subjected  only  to  grain  size  analyses. 

Dredging  and  dredged  material  management  activities  will  also  require  a  variety  of  permits  from 
the  NJDEP,  including  a  CZM  Consistency  Determination.  The  use  of  any  dredged  material  as 
on-site  fill  -  including  material  excavated  from  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  -  will 
require  an  Acceptable  Use  Determination  from  the  Department.

At  the  May  9,  2010  meeting,  it  was  also  stated  that  construction  of  a  new  dredged  material 
upland  CDF  on  the  PSEG  property  may  be  needed.  If  still  needed,  the  potential  impacts  of  the 
construction  and  use  of  such  a  facility  must  also  be  comprehensively  evaluated  and  approved 
by  the  Department,  consistent  with  the  requirements  specified  in  the  1997  NJDEP  Dredging 
Technical  Manual.  (0020-9  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Any  potential  impacts  of  construction  activities  such  as  effects  of  dredging  on 
aquatic  resources  will  be  discussed  in  Section  4.3.2. 

Comment:  (9)  ER,  Section  4.2.1 .1 .4,  page  4.2-5:  briefly  describes  construction  and  dredging 
activities  along  the  Delaware  River  shoreline.  A  total  area  of  92  acres  -  approximately 
590,000  CY  of  sediment  -  is  proposed  to  be  dredged.  The  document  concludes  that  impacts 
associated  with  dredging  are  small.  However,  much  more  work  is  needed  to  comprehensively 
evaluate  the  potential  impacts  resulting  from  dredging  and  dredged  material  management 
activities  -  see  Comment  #8.  (0020-12  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Any  potential  impacts  on  aquatic  ecosystems  resulting  from  construction  activities 
such  as  dredging  will  be  discussed  in  Section  4.3.2. 

Comment:  (10)  ER,  Section  4. 2. 3.1,  page  4.2-13,  para  #2:  states  that  "Based  on  the  findings 
of  the  USACE's  Delaware  River  main  channel  deepening  project  Environmental  Assessment, 
dredging  is  not  expected  to  result  in  degradation  of  water  quality.”  The  evaluation  of  potential

Comments  #8  and  #9.  [Also  see  Sections  5. 2. 1.2  and  10.5.2.1]  (0020-26  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  information  in  support  of  the  application.  It  does 
not  provide  any  specific  information  related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action 
and  will  not  be  evaluated  in  the  EIS.  Any  impacts  due  to  construction  activities  such  as 
dredging  on  aquatic  resources  will  be  evaluated,  however,  in  Section  4.3.2. 

Comment:  Impacts  to  the  quality  of  surface  waters  and  the  alteration  of  river  bottom  sediments 
within  the  Delaware  River  and  adjacent  marsh  creeks  are  expected  as  a  result  of  the 
construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  facility,  and  will  include  those  associated  with  the 
development  of  shoreline  features  (intake  structure,  barge  facility,  heavy  haul  road),  dredging  of 
sediments  from  the  near-shore  area  of  the  Delaware  River  to  provide  for  water  intake  and 
discharge  and  to  provide  adequate  draft  for  barge  access  during  construction,  and  the  filling  of 
9.5  acres  of  coastal  tidal  wetlands  and  shallow  open  water  areas.  (0022-2  [Gorski,  Stanley]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  due  to  construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  facility  on 
aquatic  ecosystems  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  5.3.2  and  4.3.2. 

Comment:  Increases  in  turbidity  through  the  resuspension  of  sediments  into  the  water  column 
from  dredging  and  port  operations  will  degrade  water  quality,  lower  dissolved  oxygen  levels,  and 
potentially  release  chemical  contaminants  bound  to  the  fine-grained  estuarine/marine 
sediments.  Sedimentation  and  wave  patterns  in  the  area  may  be  altered  as  a  result  of  vessels 
entering  and  exiting  the  proposed  mooring  area  also  resulting  in  increased  turbidity.  Suspended 
sediments  mask  pheromones  used  by  migratory  fishes,  and  can  smother  immobile  benthic 
organisms  and  demersal  newly-  settle  juvenile  fish  (Auld  and  Schubel  1978;  Breitburg  1988; 
Newcombe  and  MacDonald  1991;  Burton  1993;  Nelson  and  Wheeler  1997).  As  supported 
above,  the  project  area  provides  important  habitat  for  striped  bass  including  valuable  spawning 
grounds  and  nursery  habitat.  Increases  in  turbidity  will  adversely  affect  striped  bass  larvae's

ability  to  capture  prey  (Fay  et  al.  1983  in  Able  and  Fahay  1998).  The  decrease  in  water 
circulation  can  also  adversely  affect  striped  bass  survival  as  strong  current  is  needed  to  keep 
the  eggs  suspended  in  the  water  column  and  prevent  them  from  being  smothered  by  silt 
(Bigelow  and  Schroeder  1953).  (0022-4  [Gorski,  Stanley]) 

Response:  Any  potential  effects  of  dredging  activities  such  as  increases  in  turbidity  and 
alteration  of  water  circulation  on  fish  and  benthic  organisms  will  be  discussed  in  Section  4.3.2. 

Comment:  Guidelines  under  Section  404(b)(1 )  of  the  federal  Clean  Water  Act  require  that 
actions  proposed  within  waters  of  the  United  States,  especially  those  that  are  not  water- 
dependent,  are  required  to  demonstrate  that  they  have  considered  all  appropriate  reasonable 
and  prudent  measures  to  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  to  waters.  If  all  measures  to  avoid  and 
minimize  wetland  impacts  have  been  considered  and  employed  to  the  extent  practicable  and 
result  in  unavoidable  impacts,  a  compensatory  mitigation  plan  should  be  developed  and 
implemented. 

The  applicant  should  undertake  a  complete  analysis  of  alternatives  that  complies  fully  with  the 
Clean  Water  Act  Section  404  (b)(1 )  Guidelines  that  documents  avoidance,  minimization  and 
mitigation  for  all  impacts.  Alternate  locations  as  well  as  a  documentation  of  purpose  and  need 
should  be  provided  as  part  of  this  analysis.  For  any  unavoidable  impacts,  a  compensatory 
mitigation  plan  to  offset  all  of  the  projects  impacts  to  aquatic  resources  including  EFH  should  be 
developed  in  accordance  with  the  federal  standards  and  criteria  for  compensatory  mitigation  for 
losses  of  aquatic  resources  published  in  the  Federal  Register  on  April  10,  2008  (vol.  73  No. 

70).  This  plan  should  be  developed  as  early  in  the  permit  process  as  possible  and  in 
consultation  with  the  applicable  federal,  state  and  local  resource  agencies  and  will  be 
implemented  on  and  in  the  immediate  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  to  the  extent  practicable.  (0022-6 
[Gorski,  Stanley]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  on  aquatic  ecosystems,  including  wetlands,  due  to  construction 
and/or  operation  of  the  proposed  facility  and  mitigation  of  such  potential  impacts  will  be 
discussed  in  Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2  of  the  EIS.  In  addition,  alternative  energies  will  be 
discussed  in  Chapter  9.

Comment:  Endangered  and  Threatened  Species 

The  Atlantic  sturgeon  (Acipenser  oxyrinchus)  may  be  found  in  the  Delaware  River  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  project  area  at  certain  times  of  the  year.  On  October  6,  2010,  NOAA  issued  a  Federal 
Register  Notice  (75  FRN  61872).  The  notice  identifies  the  Hudson  River  and  Delaware  River 
Atlantic  sturgeon  stocks  as  a  distinct  population  segment  (DPS)  called  the  New  York  Bight  DPS. 
This  DPS  has  been  proposed  to  be  listed  as  endangered.  The  Atlantic  Sturgeon  Status  Review 
Team  (ASSRT)  identified  15  different  stressors  that  may  impact  the  Atlantic  sturgeon 
populations  including  poor  water  quality  and  habitat  loss  (2007).  Dredging  and  vessel  strikes 
are  also  considered  to  be  important  stressors  on  the  populations  of  Atlantic  sturgeon  (75  FRN 
61872  et  seq.)  According  to  the  ASSRT  (2007),  Ryder  (1888)  suggested  that  juvenile  Atlantic 
sturgeon  used  the  tidal  freshwater  reach  of  the  Delaware  River  as  a  nursery  area  and  Lazzari  et 
al.  (1986)  frequently  captured  juvenile  Atlantic  sturgeon  from  May  -December  in  the  upper  tidal 
portion  of  the  river  below  Trenton,  New  Jersey. 

Shortnose  sturgeon  (Acipenser  brevirostrum)  typically  occurs  in  deep  water  channels  although 
they  do  occur  in  the  shallower  waters  while  foraging.  The  abundance  of  adult  shortnose 
sturgeon  is  greatest  in  the  tidal  river  from  Trenton  to  Philadelphia  (Hastings  et  al.  1987; 

O'Herron  et  al.  1993).  In-water  construction  activities  can  affect  shortnose  and  Atlantic 
sturgeon  through  direct  injury  or  mortality,  displacing  species  from  the  area,  or  by  altering  the 
habitat  and  destroying  forage  items. 

Shortnose  sturgeon  (Acipenser  brevirostrum)  typically  occurs  in  deep  water  channels  although 
they  do  occur  in  the  shallower  waters  similar  to  that  of  the  project  area  while  foraging.  Any 
discretionary  federal  action,  such  as  the  approval  or  funding  of  a  project  by  a  Federal  agency, 
that  may  affect  a  listed  species  must  undergo  consultation  pursuant  to  Section  7  of  the 
Endangered  Species  Act  (ESA)  of  1973,  as  amended.  The  NRC  should  submit  its 
determination  of  effects,  along  with  justification  for  the  determination  and  a  request  for 
concurrence,  to  the  attention  of  the  Endangered  Species  Coordinator,  NMFS,  Northeast 
Regional  Office,  Protected  Resources  Division,  One  Blackburn  Drive,  Gloucester,  MA  01930. 

For  additional  information  on  the  Section  7  consultation  process  or  shortnose  sturgeon,  please 
contact  Julie  Crocker  at  (978)  282-8480  orjulie.crocker@noaa.gov.  (0022-14  [Gorski,  Stanley]) 

Response:  The  NRC  initiated  informal  consultation  with  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service 
(NMFS)  for  a  list  of  species  protected  by  the  Endangered  Species  Act  that  are  under  the 
jurisdiction  of  NMFS  and  that  NMFS  believes  to  occur  in  the  region  of  influence  associated  with 
construction  and  operation  of  the  PS  EG  Site.  NRC  will  evaluate  the  impacts  of  construction  and 
operation  of  the  proposed  facility  on  threatened  and  endangered  species  including  the  Atlantic 
and  Shortnose  sturgeon.  These  potential  impacts  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  5. 3. 2  and  4. 3. 2 
of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Fish  and  Wildlife  Coordination  Act 

Notwithstanding  our  mandates  under  the  MSA,  the  NMFS  also  has  responsibilities  under  the 
Fish  and  Wildlife  Coordination  Act  (FWCA)  to  provide  federal  agencies  such  as  the  NRC  with 
recommendations  to  avoid,  minimize  and  to  mitigate  for  direct,  indirect  and  cumulative  impacts 
to  any  and  all  NOAA  trust  resources  that  are  present  within  the  Delaware  River  Basin.

NUREG-2168 


Appendix  D 


The  Delaware  Estuary  including  its  tributaries  provides  habitat  for  a  wide  variety  of  NOAA  trust 
resources  including  alewife  (Alosa  pseudoharengus),  American  eel  (Anguilla  rostrata)  American 
shad  (Alosa  sapidissima),  Atlantic  croaker  (Micropogonias  undulatus),  Atlantic  menhaden 
(Brevoortia  tyrannus),  Atlantic  sturgeon  (Acipenser  oxyrinchus),  blueback  herring  (Alosa 
aestivalis),  bluefish,  hickory  shad  (Alosa  mediocris),  spot  (Leiostomus  xanthurus)  tautog 
(Tautoga  onitis),  weakfish,  white  perch  (Morone  americana),  yellow  perch  (Percajlavescens), 
striped  bass  (Morone  saxatilis),  hogchoker  (Trinectes  maculatus),  killifish,  bay  anchovy, 
silversides,  mummichog  and  may  others. 

Because  landing  statistics  and  the  number  offish  observed  on  annual  spawning  runs  indicate  a 
drastic  decline  in  alewife  and  blueback  herring  populations  throughout  much  of  their  range  since 
the  mid-1 960's,  they  have  been  designated  as  species  of  concern  by  NMFS  in  a  Federal 
Register  Notice  dated  October  17,  2006  (71  FRN  61022).  Species  of  concern  are  those  species 
about  which  NMFS  has  some  concerns  regarding  status  and  threats,  but  for  which  insufficient 
information  is  available  to  indicate  a  need  to  list  the  species  under  the  Endangered  Species  Act. 
The  shallow  water  environment  in  this  section  of  the  Delaware  River  provides  valuable  habitat 
for  these  species  as  well  as  striped  bass  and  American  shad. 

The  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  also  has  sampled  the 
Delaware  River  and  Bay  in  the  project  area  for  nearly  30  years  since  1980.  This  long-  term 
survey  documents  the  use  of  the  this  portion  of  the  river  by  a  wide  variety  of  species  including 
blueback  herring,  alewife,  American  shad  American  shad  (Alosa  sapidissima),  American  eel 
(Anguilla  rostrata),  Atlantic  herring  (Clupea  harengus),  Atlantic  menhaden  (Brevoortia  tyrannus), 
bay  anchovy,  (Anchoa  mitchilli),  blueback  herring,  gizzard  shad  (Dorosoma  cepedianum), 
hogchoker  (Trinectes  maculatus),  striped  bass,  yellow  perch  (Percajlavescens),  white  perch 
(Morone  americana),  Atlantic  silverside  (Menidia  menidia),  and  many  others  (NJDEP  2010). 
Many  of  these  species  are  both  commercially  and  recreationally  important  and  managed  by  the 
ASFMC  or  are  valuable  prey  species  for  ASFMC  or  federally  managed  fish. 

Buckel  and  Conover  (1997)  in  Fahey  et  al.  (1999)  reports  that  diet  items  of  juvenile  bluefish 
include  Alosa  species  such  American  shad,  blueback  herring  and  alewife  as  well  as  bay 
anchovy,  silversides  and  other  fish  species.  We  note  that  the  NJDEP  survey  data  show  that 
federally  managed  bluefish  are  present  in  the  project  area.  This  indicates  that  both  the  prey 
species  and  the  predator  are  present  in  the  Delaware  River  in  and  around  the  project  area. 
Juvenile  Alosa  species  have  all  been  identified  as  prey  species  for  windowpane  (Scophthalmus 
aquosus)  and  summer  flounder  (Paralichthys  dentatus)  in  Steimle  et  al.  (2000).  Windowpane 
and  summer  flounder  are  federally  managed  species  whose  EFH  has  been  designated  in  the 
mixing  zone  of  the  Delaware  River. 

Submerged  aquatic  vegetation  (SAV)  has  historically  been  absent  from  Delaware  Bay. 

However,  to  date,  there  has  been  no  comprehensive  mapping  of  SAV  in  the  Delaware  Estuary 
to  verify  its  presence  or  absence.  Several  species  have  been  observed  though  in  the  tidal  river 
since  1970,  including:  Vallisneria  americana,  Myriophyllum  spicatum,  Elodea  nuttallii, 
Najasflexillis,  Potamogeton  sp.  and  others  (Schuyler,  1988).  Wild  celery  (Vallisneria 
americana)  has  been  documented  i  (0022-12  [Gorski,  Stanley])

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  information  relevant  to  some  of  the  aquatic 
organisms  present  in  the  Delaware  Bay  but  it  does  not  provide  any  specific  information  related 
to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action.  Any  potential  impacts,  however,  resulting 
from  construction  and/or  operational  effects  on  aquatic  resources  will  be  addressed  in  Sections

Comment:  Magnuson  Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Management  Act  (MSA)  Section  305 
(b)(2)  of  the  1996  amendments  to  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and 
Management  Act  (MSA)  requires  all  federal  agencies  to  consult  with  NOAA  Fisheries  on  any 
action,  including  those  proposed  by  the  NRC,  that  is  authorized,  funded,  or  undertaken  by  that 
agency  and  that  may  adversely  affect  EFH.  Included  in  this  consultation  process  is  the 
preparation  of  a  complete  and  appropriate  EFH  assessment  to  provide  necessary  information 
on  which  to  consult.  Our  EFH  regulation  at  50  CFR  600.905  mandates  the  preparation  of  EFH 
assessments  and  generally  outlines  each  agency's  obligations  in  this  consultation  procedure. 

The  estuarine  portions  of  the  Delaware  River  and  its  tributaries  including  the  estuarine  areas  of 
both  Alloway  and  Hope  Creeks  have  been  designated  as  EFH  for  a  wide  variety  of  species 
including  red  hake  (Urophycis  chuss),  winter  flounder  (Pseudopleuronectes  americanus), 
windowpane  flounder  (Scophthalmus  aquosus),  bluefish  (Pomatomus  saltatrix),  Atlantic 
butterfish  (Peprilus  triacanthus),  scup  (Stenotomus  chrysops),  summer  flounder  (Paralichthys

(Rachycenlron  canadum),  little  skate  (Leucoraja  erinacea),  winter  skate  (Leucoraja  ocellata)  and 
cleamose  skate  (Raja  eglanteria).  A  more  detailed  listing  of  EFH  and  federally  managed 
species  and  EFH  consultation  requirements  can  be  found  on  our  website  at: 
www.nero.nmfs.gov/hcd. 

The  EFH  final  rule  published  in  the  Federal  Register  on  January  17,  2002  defines  an  adverse 
effect  as:  any  impact  which  reduces  the  quality  and/or  quantity  of  EFH.  The  rule  further  states 
that: 

"An  adverse  effect  may  include  direct  or  indirect  physical,  chemical,  or  biological  alterations  of 
the  waters  or  substrate  and  loss  of,  or  injury  to,  benthic  organisms,  prey  species  and  their 
habitat  and  other  ecosystems  components,  if  such  modifications  reduce  the  quality  and/or 
quantity  of  EFH.  Adverse  effects  to  EFH  may  result  from  action  occurring  within  EFH  or  outside 
EFH  and  may  include  site-specific  or  habitat-wide  impacts,  including  individual,  cumulative,  or 
synergistic  consequences  of  actions." 

The  rule  also  states: 

"Loss  of  prey  may  be  an  adverse  effect  on  EFH  and  managed  species  because  the  presence  of 
prey  makes  waters  and  substrate  function  as  feeding  habitat  and  the  definition  of  EFH  includes 
waters  and  substrate  necessary  to  fish  for  feeding.  Therefore,  actions  that  reduce  the 
availability  of  a  major  prey  species,  either  through  direct  harm  or  capture,  or  through  adverse 
impacts  to  the  prey  species'  habitat  that  are  known  to  cause  a  reduction  in  the  population  of  the 
prey  species,  may  be  considered  adverse  effects  on  EFH  if  such  actions  reduce  the  quality  of

Appendix  D 


In  order  to  initiate  consultation  pursuant  to  the  MSA,  the  NRC  must  submit  a  full  and  complete 
EFH  assessment  that  considers  the  individual  and  cumulative  and  the  direct  and  indirect 
impacts  of  the  proposed  project  on  EFH,  federal  managed  species  and  their  prey  recognizing 
the  definition  of  adverse  impact  discussed  above.  The  required  contents  of  an  EFH  assessment 
includes:  1 )  a  description  of  the  action;  2)  an  analysis  of  the  potential  adverse  effects  of  the 
action  on  EFH  and  the  managed  species;  3)  the  NRC's  conclusions  regarding  the  effects  of  the 
action  on  EFH;  4)  proposed  mitigation,  if  applicable.  Given  the  scope  of  this  project,  other 
information  that  should  be  contained  in  the  EFH  assessment  includes:  1 )  the  results  of  on-site 
inspections  to  evaluate  the  habitat  and  site-specific  effects;  2)  the  views  of  recognized  experts 
on  the  habitat  or  the  species  that  may  be  affected;  3)  a  review  of  pertinent  literature  and  related 
information;  and  5)  an  analysis  of  alternatives  to  the  action  that  could  avoid  or  minimize  the 
adverse  (0022-10  [Gorski,  Stanley]) 

Response:  The  NRC  initiated  informal  consultation  with  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service 
(NMFS)  for  a  list  of  species  protected  by  the  Endangered  Species  Act  that  are  under  the 
jurisdiction  of  NMFS  and  that  NMFS  believes  to  occur  in  the  region  of  influence  associated  with 
construction  and  operation  of  the  PS  EG  Site.  Correspondence  with  NMFS  will  also  occur  for 
the  presence  of  essential  fish  habitat  (EFFI).  NRC  intends  to  include  an  EFH  assessment  in  the 
EIS.  In  addition,  any  potential  impacts  of  construction  and/or  operational  activities  on  the  fish 
populations  of  the  Delaware  estuary  will  be  addressed  in  Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  ER  Page  27  of  136-Hydrological  Alterations 

"Dredged  material  removed  as  part  of  this  construction  activity  will  be  transported  to  and  placed 
in  an  on-site  or  other  approved  upland  disposal  facility." 

Does  the  licensee  plan  on  expanding  the  REMP  program  to  include  air  particulate/iodine 
monitoring,  surface  water  runoff,  or  soil  sampling  in  the  area  of  this  CDP  (if  onsite  area  is  used 
for  materials)?  An  air  monitoring  site  should  be  placed  downwind  of  the  CDP  based  on  annual 
meteorological  direction  (SE).  Also,  will  there  be  expanded  ground  water  monitoring  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  CDF? 

Once  complete,  sampling  locations  near  the  intake  and  discharge  canals  will  be  needed, 
especially  for  media  such  as  aquatic  biota  and  sediment.  Since  the  structures  are  upstream  in 
the  Delaware,  PSEG  will  need  to  rethink  their  exiting  collection  location  north  of  the  plant  that  is 
considered,  'control'.  This  site  may  need  to  be  moved  further  upstream.  (0019-4  [Brubaker, 

Scott])  (0019-5  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Any  potential  impacts  due  to  construction  activities  such  as  dredging  on  aquatic 
ecosystems  will  be  addressed  in  Section  4.3.2  of  the  EIS.  Sampling  locations  for  aquatic 
ecology  monitoring  will  be  addressed  in  Section  4. 3. 2. 4.  Finally,  regarding  the  comment  to 
expand  the  current  Radiological  Environmental  Monitoring  Program  (REMP)  in  place  for  the 
operating  reactors  Salem/Hope  Creek  as  a  result  of  construction  of  the  proposed  facility,  will  be 
discussed  as  part  of  the  staff's  evaluation  in  Chapter  4  of  the  EIS.

D.2.11  Comments  Concerning  Socioeconomics 

Comment:  And  if  you  want  to  create  jobs  in  this  state,  here,  the  way  to  do  it  is  build  solar 
farms,  build  wind  farms.  Build  two  new  cooling  towers  at  Salem  I  and  II.  They  will  create 
hundreds  of  construction  jobs.  And,  also,  you  will  create  fishing  jobs,  which  add  up  to 
thousands  and  thousands  of  jobs.  That  should  be  the  approach,  also,  that  should  be 
considered  in  the  overall  discussion  of  this  issue.  (0002-6-16  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Response:  The  NRC  is  not  involved  in  establishing  employment  programs  or  policy  nor  in 
promoting  employment  opportunities  within  any  state;  rather,  it  regulates  nuclear  energy  to 
protect  public  health  and  safety  within  existing  policy.  Nevertheless,  the  potential  impacts  of 
constructing  a  nuclear  unit(s)  at  the  PSEG  Site,  including  the  impacts  associated  with 
employment,  will  be  evaluated  in  Chapter  4  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Building  a  new  plant  means  local  jobs,  and  it  would  drive  business  to  our  little  town. 
(0001-1-1  [Davis,  Robert]) 

Comment:  This  new  application  represents  the  principles  in  which  the  county's  economic 
development  strategy  is  based  on.  And  that  being  green  technology,  and  construction  methods, 
sustainability,  focus  location  on  preservation  of  open  space,  regional  cooperation,  creation  of  a 
wide  range  of  employment  opportunities,  reduction  in  property  taxes,  and  transparent  and  civil 
involvement.  (0001-12-2  [Kugler,  John]) 

Comment:  I  would  just  like  to  mention  a  few  things,  that  the  key  facts  would  be  related,  if  this 
application  is  approved.  They  would  generate  roughly  430  million  in  sales  of  goods  and 
services,  in  the  local  community.  It  would  create  an  additional  40  million  dollars  in  total  labor 
income,  for  the  new  unit.  This  plant  would  create  approximately  450  new  permanent  jobs,  that 
are  so  desperately  needed  in  Salem  County.  While  under  construction  it  would  be  roughly  15  to 
2,000  construction  jobs  that  would  be  created.  The  plant  would  generate  roughly  20  million 
dollars  in  state  and  local  tax  revenue.  There  would  be  educational  opportunities,  and  local 
infrastructure  benefits  from  the  tax  revenues.  And  the  facility  would  roughly  generate  75  million 
in  federal  tax  payments  annually.  (0001-12-3  [Kugler,  John]) 

Comment:  And  in  these  difficult  economic  times,  the  development  of  a  new  nuclear  facility 
would  provide  much  needed  job  growth.  The  construction  phase,  as  was  mentioned  by  Jack, 
creates  1 ,400  to  almost  2,000  jobs.  And  when  completed,  the  facility  would  employ  over 
450  jobs  in  local,  high  paying  jobs.  Every  year  nuclear  plants  generate  approximately 
430  million  in  sales  of  goods  and  services  to  the  local  community,  not  to  mention  their  significant 
tax  benefits  that  benefit  local  infrastructure,  public  services,  and  schools.  (0001-13-12  [Salmon, 
Edward]) 

Comment:  With  unemployment  in  the  county  hovering  around  12  percent,  the  economic 
possibilities  of  this  expansion  cannot  be  understated.  (0001-15-2  [Gaye,  Earl]) 

Comment:  Construction  of  a  new  plant  would  also  be  very  good  for  the  local  economy. 

Building  a  new  plant  would  result  in  the  creation  of  thousands  of  jobs  for  the  construction  side  of 
the  house.  And,  afterwards,  up  to  700  permanent  jobs,  that  pay  about  36  percent  more  than  the 
average  salaries  in  the  area.  Salem  County  is  a  rural  community  at  heart,  with  very  few

industries,  and  very  few  jobs  to  offer.  If  you  are  fortunate,  as  our  members,  and  myself,  and  all 
others  in  the  company  are,  PSEG  is  the  place  to  work.  Building  a  new  plant  opens  doors  of 
opportunities  for  stable  employment,  a  better  career,  and  a  better  life  for  thousands  of  people  in 
the  area.  (0001-17-6  [Hassler,  Charles]) 

Comment:  The  potential  construction  of  a  new  plant  would  mean  so  much  to  Salem  County, 
with  the  increase  of  hundreds  of  permanent  local  jobs,  in  addition  to  just  on  the  site,  with  a  ripple 
effect  on  other  businesses,  restaurants,  hotels,  clothing  stores,  and  other  vendors  of  that  nature, 
would  truly  benefit.  There  probably  isn't  a  family,  in  Salem  County,  who  doesn't  benefit,  at  least 
indirectly,  from  the  economic  impact  that  PSEG  now  has,  and  the  increase  in  their  effect  in  the 
future  would  only  be  a  plus.  The  dollars  that  are  invested  here  would  be  unprecedented,  and 
would  contribute  to  increased  prosperity  and  economic  development  in  Salem  County  for  many 
years  to  come.  (0001-18-5  [Duffy,  Brian]) 

Comment:  Construction  of  an  additional  nuclear  facility  and  access  road  on  this  location  will 
impact  the  health,  aesthetics,  and  quality  of  life  of  those  fishing,  boating,  and  birding,  and  living 
in  the  region.  (0001-19-5  [Blake,  Matt]) 

Comment:  On  this  project,  over  4,000  craftsmen  will  be  needed  for  several  years  to  construct 
this  unit.  The  economy  in  southern  New  Jersey  is  such  right  now,  50  percent  of  the  building 
trades  are  out  of  work  right  now.  (0001-22-3  [Kehoe,  Jim]) 

Comment:  A  potential  new  power  plant  would  have  many  impacts.  Some  of  them  are 
4,100  construction  jobs,  during  the  peak  construction,  including  1,500  electricians,  iron  workers, 
and  pipe  fitters.  It  would  create  an  additional  4,000  jobs  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware  and 
Pennsylvania,  as  a  result  of  the  purchase  of  goods  and  services  during  construction.  And, 
finally,  600  permanent  jobs  that  would  be  at  the  plant  when  it  becomes  operational.  These 
impacts,  as  well  as  many  others,  will  affect  our  community.  (0001-3-2  [Joyce,  Tom]) 

Comment:  WRA  is  interested  in  PSEG's  proposed  project,  because  the  proposed  nuclear  plant 
would  be  a  major  water  user  located  in  the  Delaware  River  basin,  and  it  is  an  important  part  of 
the  economy  of  New  Jersey,  and  the  region  at  large.  (0001-8-2  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  My  questions  would  include  concern  for  extreme  floods,  which  may  be  different  now 
than  when  the  original  plants  were  put  into  existence,  adequate  entrance  and  egress  systems, 
maintaining  a  good,  continuous  dialogue  with  the  community.  (0001-9-8  [Lacandro,  Roger]) 

Comment:  With  unemployment  in  the  county  hovering  around  12  percent,  the  economic 
possibilities  of  this  expansion  cannot  be  understated.  (0002-2-2  [Bobbitt,  Bruce]) 

Comment:  Again,  there  are  no  surprises,  including  our  plans  to  explore  the  construction  of  a 
new  nuclear  plant.  The  potential  new  plant  would  have  many  impacts,  including  some 
4,100  construction  jobs,  during  peak  construction,  including  1,500  electricians,  iron  workers,  and 
pipe  fitters.  The  creation  of  an  additional  4,000  jobs  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  and 
Pennsylvania,  as  a  result  of  the  purchases  of  goods  and  services  during  the  construction.  And, 
finally,  600  permanent  jobs  when  the  new  plant  would  become  operational.  These  impacts,  as 
well  as  many  others,  will  positively  affect  our  community.  (0002-3-2  [Braun,  Bob])

Comment:  Will  the  new  jobs  have  a  tremendous  impact  in  Salem  County?  Absolutely.  And 
that  is  a  good  thing.  (0002-8-4  [Campbell,  Keith]) 

Comment:  Construction  of  an  additional  nuclear  facility  and  access  road  on  this  location  will 
impact  the  health,  aesthetics  and  quality  of  life  of  those  fishing,  boating,  birding  and  living  in  the 
region.  (0003-6  [Batty,  Sandy]  [Dillingham,  Tim]  [Galetto,  Jane  Morton]  [Goldsmith,  Amy]  [McNutt, 
Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [O'Gorman,  Margaret]  [Schulte,  James]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  And  in  these  difficult  economic  times,  the  development  of  a  new  nuclear  facility 
would  provide  much-needed  job  growth.  The  construction  phase  creates  1,400  to  1,800  jobs, 
and  when  completed  the  facility  would  employ  over  500  people  in  local  high-  paying  jobs.  Every 
year  nuclear  plants  generate  approximately  $430  million  in  the  sales  of  goods  and  services  in 
their  local  communities,  not  to  mention  their  significant  tax  contributions  that  benefit  local 
infrastructure,  public  services  and  schools.  (0004-4  [Salmon,  Edward]) 

Comment:  Construction  of  a  new  plant  would  also  be  very  good  for  the  local  economy. 

Building  a  new  plant  would  result  in  the  creation  of  between  1400  to  1800  jobs  and  as  high  as 
2500  or  more  at  peak  employment  during  the  construction.  After  that,  a  new  plant  would  mean 
400  to  700  permanent  jobs  that  pay  about  36  percent  more  than  average  salaries  in  the  area. 
Salem  County  is  a  rural  community  at  heart,  with  very  few  industries  and  very  few  jobs  to  offer. 

If  you  are  fortunate,  as  our  members  and  all  others  in  the  company  are,  PSEG  is  the  place  to 
work.  Building  a  new  plant  opens  the  doors  of  opportunity  for  stable  employment,  a  better 
career  and  a  better  way  of  life  for  hundreds  of  people.  (0005-7  [Hassler,  Charles]) 

Comment:  Construction  of  a  new  plant  would  result  in  much  needed  jobs  in  the  construction 
trade,  which  in  New  Jersey  is  experiencing  unemployment  rates  of  30%  and  higher.  Plant 
construction  would  result  in  more  than  2,000  jobs  for  steelworkers,  pipefitters,  electrical 
contractors  and  concrete  workers.  The  new  plant  would  also  employ  between  400  and 
700  people  with  good  paying  salaries.  (0006-3  [Patouhas,  Maria]) 

Comment:  My  questions  would  include:  concern  for  extreme  floods  and  adequate  entrance 
and  egress  systems,  maintaining  a  good,  continuous  dialog  with  the  community  and  an 
insistence  that  only  the  best  science  be  incorporated  in  planning  and  construction.  (0008-9

Development  Strategy  is  based  on.  That  being:

Reduction  in  property  taxes 

Transparency  and  civic  involvement  (0009-3  [Kugler,  John]) 

Comment:  I  would  like  to  mention  some  keys  facts  that  would  be  related  to  this  application  if 
approved: 

Generate  roughly  $430  million  in  sales  of  goods  and  services  in  the  local  community.  Create  an 
additional  $40  million  in  total  labor  income  for  the  new  unit.  This  new  plant  would  create 
approximately  450  new  permanent  jobs  that  are  so  desperately  needed.  While  under 
construction  roughly  1 ,400  to  1 ,800  construction  jobs  would  be  created.  This  new  plant  would 
generate  roughly  $20  million  in  state  and  local  tax  revenue.  Education  and  local  infrastructure 
benefit  from  tax  revenues.  This  facility  would  generate  roughly  $75  million  in  federal  tax 
payment  annually.  A  substantial  number  of  non  nuclear  jobs  estimated  to  be  400  to  500  would 
be  created  as  a  result  of  a  new  unit  being  built. 

Other  benefits  to  building  this  new  unit  that  would  have  a  positive  impact  regionally  are  the 
boost  to  the  local  economy  with  the  purchase  of  commodities  such  as: 

400,000  cubic  feet  of  concrete 

66,000  tons  of  steel 

44  miles  of  piping 

300  miles  of  electrical  wiring 

130,000  electrical  components  (0009-4  [Kugler,  John]) 

Comment:  WRA  is  interested  in  PSEG's  proposed  project  because  PSEG's  proposed  nuclear 
plant  will  be  a  major  water  user  located  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  and  is  an  important  part  of 
the  economy  of  New  Jersey  and  the  region  at  large.  (0011-2  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  In  summary,  I  believe  that  the  construction  of  a  properly  permitted  additional 
nuclear  power  generating  facility  at  Artificial  Island  will  be  a  benefit  to  not  only  the  residents  and 
landowners  of  Elsinboro  Township,  but  also  provide  a  much  needed  economic  boon  to  Salem 
County  and  Southern  New  Jersey  as  a  whole.  (0016-5  [Elk,  John]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  evaluate  the  regional  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  proposed 
action  in  Chapters  4  and  5  of  the  EIS,  including  impacts  related  to  the  local  economy,  taxes, 
transportation,  aesthetics  and  recreation,  housing,  education,  community  infrastructure  and 
social  services. 

Comment:  PSEG  has  also  supported  the  Chamber  of  Commerce's  efforts  to  enhance  business 
relationships  with  the  other  businesses  and  organizations  in  Salem  County,  and  the  surrounding 
areas.  In  fact,  one  of  our  initiatives,  recently,  has  been  to  buy  locally,  and  we  have  expanded 
that  message  not  only  to  citizens  with  consumer  goods,  but  to  large  businesses.  And  PSEG

was  already  way  of  the  curve  with  that.  They  support  many  local  businesses,  and  vendors. 

And  I  think  Tom  mentioned  the  figure  of  80  million  dollars,  annually,  into  the  local  economy. 

One  of  the  most  important  things  is  to  bring  dollars  into  the  county,  and  not  have  dollars  drift 
out.  And  I  just  did  a  little  bit  of  rough  math,  with  our  60,000  or  so  citizens  of  Salem  County. 

That  80  million  dollars  would  probably  be  about  5,000  dollars  per  family,  in  Salem  County,  and  I 
hate  to  think  how  bad  it  would  be  without  that.  Salem  County  and  Cumberland  County  are  the 
two  poorest  counties  in  the  state.  So  the  economic  impact,  in  a  positive  way,  of  PSEG  is 
tremendously  important,  and  any  growth  would  only  help  our  situation  down  here.  (0001-18-3 
[Duffy,  Brian]) 

Comment:  Just  to  reiterate  some  other  comments  that  have  been  said  today.  PSEG  Nuclear 
plays  a  very  important  role  in  our  regional  economy.  The  company  is  the  largest  employer  in 
Salem  County,  employing  1 ,500  people,  and  pays  more  than  two  million  in  local  property  taxes. 
Each  year  PSEG  Nuclear  spends  millions  of  dollars  with  local  companies  in  southern  New 
Jersey,  to  help  them  generate  electricity.  This  investment  results  in  direct  jobs  for  hundreds  of 
people,  and  even  more  indirect  jobs  in  our  region.  (0001-23-2  [Patouhas,  Maria]) 

Comment:  We  recognize  the  impact  of  the  current  operations  that  we  have  on  the  community. 
We  have  1,500  local  employees,  forty  percent  of  them  from  Salem  County.  We  purchase  goods 
and  services  totaling  more  than  81  million  dollars  in  southern  New  Jersey.  And  we  pay  more 
than  two  million  dollars  in  property  taxes  a  year.  (0001-3-1  [Joyce,  Tom]) 

Comment:  The  jobs  to  this  region,  PSEG  is  the  largest  employer  to  Salem.  They  invest  84,  85 
million  dollars  into  the  economy  of  southern  New  Jersey,  and  they  provide  excellent  jobs. 
(0002-1-4  [Sweeney,  Steve]) 

Comment:  We  recognize  the  impact  that  our  current  operations  have  on  the  community, 
including  1 ,500  local  employees,  some  40  percent  of  which  hail  from  Salem  County.  The 
purchase  of  goods  and  services,  totaling  more  than  80  million  dollars,  per  year,  from  south 
Jersey  businesses,  and  more  than  two  million  dollars  a  year  in  local  property  taxes.  (0002-3-1 
[Braun,  Bob]) 

Comment:  And  if  you  look  at  it  in  that  basic  principle,  then  they  should  stop  killing  the  fish  at 
Salem  I  and  II.  It  is  destroying  the  fishing  industry,  so  you  are  losing  jobs.  (0002-6-14  [Schneider, 
Richard]) 

Comment:  PSEG  Nuclear  plays  a  very  important  role  in  our  regional  economy.  The  company 
is  the  largest  employer  in  Salem  County,  employing  1,500  people  and  pays  more  than  $2  million 
in  local  property  taxes.  Each  year,  PSEG  Nuclear  spends  millions  of  dollars  with  local 
companies  in  Southern  New  Jersey  to  help  them  generate  electricity.  This  investment  results  in 
direct  jobs  for  hundreds  of  people,  and  even  more  indirect  jobs,  in  our  region.  In  fact,  a  Nuclear 
Energy  Institute  analysis  shows  that  every  dollar  spent  by  the  average  nuclear  plant  results  in 
the  creation  of  $1 .07  in  the  local  community.  The  electricity  generated  by  the  current  plant 
provides  millions  of  businesses  and  homes  with  reliable,  safe,  clean  and  efficient  power.  (0006-

Comment:  PSEG  has  provided  good  paying  jobs  for  numerous  Elsinboro  Residents.  The 
operation  of  the  facilities  has  not  placed  any  financial  burden  on  the  local  school  system,  fire 
company  or  rescue  squad.  Rather,  to  the  contrary,  PSEG  has  been  a  strong  supporter  of  these 
entities  with  their  time  and  financial  support.  (0016-4  [Elk,  John]) 

Response:  The  existing  socioeconomic  environment  in  the  region,  including  the  PSEG  ESP 
site's  potential  impact  on  the  local  economy,  will  be  described  in  Section  2.5  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  So  you  would  be  adding  to  the  amount  of  fish  that  are  killed  at  that  facility.  So  you 
must  consider  the  existing  damage  that  the  present  facility,  Salem  I  and  II  causes,  and  adding 
even  more  damage.  And  Salem  I  and  II  draws  in  three  billion  gallons  of  water  a  day,  every  day. 
And  it  kills  billions  of  fish.  And  the  EPA  has  estimates  on  how  much.  And  I  have  a  paper  I 
would  like  to  submit  as  data.  And  they  kill  350  million  age  one  equivalent  fish.  In  other  words, 
fish  that  would  have  grown  up  to  be  a  million,  I  mean,  one  year  old.  That  is  how  they  generally 
use  their  fish  kill  data;  they  call  it  age  one  equivalent  fish.  But,  actually,  the  facility  kills  billions 
of  fish,  billions  of  smaller  fish,  which  is  the  food  chain  for  the  bigger  fish,  and  the  whole 
ecosystem.  So  my  concern  here  is  that  you  want  to  build  a  new  facility,  but  you  are  not 
stopping  the  existing  damage  caused  by  the  present  facility  that  is  there,  units  I  and  II,  which 
draw  in  three  billion  gallons  of  water,  and  have  an  open  loop  cooling  system.  So  before  you 
consider  building  a  new  facility  you  should  stop  the  damage  caused  by  the  existing  facility,  first. 

I  think  that  is  a  priority.  But  it  seems  like  just  build  another  one.  But  you  still  have  an  existing 
fish  kill  facility,  there.  And  it  kills  all  species,  all  ages.  And  it  is  destroying  the  fishing  industry 
along  the  Delaware  Bay  and  the  Delaware  River.  We  used  to  have  a  great  fishing  industry,  and 
we  don't  now.  (0002-6-12  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Response:  Cumulative  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  proposed  action  will  be  discussed  in 
Section  7.4  of  the  EIS. 

D.2.13  Comments  Concerning  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources 

Comment:  It  is  also  likely  that  the  land  swap  and  resulting  new  access  road  would  obstruct  the 
view  shed  of  the  historic  1722  Able  Mary  Nicholson  brick  house,  which  is  a  national  historic 
landmark.  (0001-19-6  [Blake,  Matt]) 

Comment:  It  is  likely  that  the  land  swap  and  resulting  new  access  road  would  obstruct  the 
viewshed  of  the  historic  1722  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  pattern  brick  house,  which  is  a  National 
Historic  Landmark.  (0003-7  [Batty,  Sandy]  [Dillingham,  Tim]  [Galetto,  Jane  Morton]  [Goldsmith,  Amy] 
[McNutt,  Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [O'Gorman,  Margaret]  [Schulte,  James]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  Society’s  research  has  provided  a  strong  foundation  for  the  study  of  the  New 
Sweden  Colony  in  1638-1655  and  is  devoted  to  preserving  the  historical  sites  of  New  Sweden. 
The  New  Sweden  Colony  was  an  effort  by  Sweden  to  claim  a  stake  in  colonial  America  and, 
from  1643-1652,  Fort  Elfsborg  was  a  strategic  fortification  utilized  to  guard  the  South  River 
(Delaware  River). 

It  is  now  the  intention  of  the  Swedish  Colonial  Society  to  discover  the  location  of  Fort  Elfsborg 
built  in  Southern  New  Jersey  along  the  Delaware  River.  The  bulk  of  the  documentation  for  the

location  of  Fort  Elfsborg  is  scattered  in  The  Swedish  Settlements  on  the  Delaware  1638-1664. 
Amandus  Johnson,  1911.  Additional  clues  are  found  in  New  York  Historical  Manuscripts-Dutch, 
Gehring,  and  in  original  documents  housed  in  the  Swedish  National  archives.  Dr.  Johnson 
cited  a  number  of  sources  of  Swedish,  Dutch  and  English  on  the  specific  location.  For  example: 
Winsor,  IV.  462:  Doc.  XII  28,  29  “This  island  was  most  judiciously  selected  for  the  erection  of  a 
fort,  being  protected  by  the  river  on  the  west,  on  the  north  by  Fishing  Creek  (Mill  Creek),  turning 
east  and  south,  on  the  south  by  an  immense  expanse  of  wild  marsh.”  This  is  probably  the  most 
definitive  location  and  is  bolstered  by  a  number  of  other  clues.  For  example:  Governor  Printz’s 
account  books  mention  the  loss  of  stockpiled  lumber  when  the  Indians  set  fire  to  the  “island.” 
The  key  here  is  what  is  considered  an  island.  The  entire  area  is  broken  into  numerous  “islands” 
by  narrow  channels.  Other  clues  are  citations  of  the  distance  of  Fort  Elfsborg  south  of  Fort 
Christina  and  in  several  reports  of  where  ships  were  anchored  in  relation  to  the  fort.  The 
location  of  the  site  in  Johnson  is  the  hub  of  the  general  area  we  wish  to  search. 

The  US  Army  Corp  of  Engineers,  1986,  Heite  and  Heite  Report  concludes  the  river  has  washed 
the  fort  site  away.  This  is  based  mostly  on  a  19th  century  farmer’s  request  for  monetary 
compensation  for  land  he  claimed  had  been  washed  away  by  the  river.  The  area  the  farmer 
cited  is  about  a  mile  from  the  historical  fort  location  given  in  Johnson.  The  Heite  and  Heite 
Report  cites  almost  no  original  17th  century  sources  regarding  the  fort  location,  but  relies  solely 
on  secondary  sources  which  are  based  on  the  farmer’s  land  washed-away  money  request. 
These  sources  were  all  created  after  the  farmer’s  claim.  The  Heite  and  Heite  Report  was 
obviously  not  familiar  with  New  Sweden  research. 

Although  it  does  not  appear  that  the  Mill  Creek  area,  where  it  is  believed  the  Fort  Elfsborg  was 
located,  will  be  affected,  we  respectfully  request  that  due  diligence  be  exercised  when  the  NRC 
does  the  environmental  review  of  the  PSEG  ESP  application.  It  is  of  the  most  importance  that 
the  NRC  ensures  a  more  comprehensive  Phase  1  survey  of  the  area  to  assure  that  the  Fort 
Elfsborg  historical  site  is  not  impacted,  compromised  or  obliterated.  (0015-1  [Birdwell,  Margaret 
(Sally)  Sooy]) 

Comment:  The  New  Jersey  Historic  Preservation  Office  (HPO)  is  currently  in  consultation  with 
the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC),  and  other  interested  parties,  regarding  the 
proposed  Hope  Creek/Salem  Nuclear  Power  Station  expansion  project  pursuant  to  Section  106 
of  the  National  Historic  Preservation  Act  and  its  implementing  regulations  36  CFR  part  800. 
Through  ongoing  consultation,  this  undertaking  has  identified  underwater  and  terrestrial 
archaeological  sites,  as  well  as,  historic  properties  within  the  physical  and  visual  area  of 
potential  effects.  Additional  investigations  are  on-going.  If  historic  properties  will  be  adversely 
affected  by  the  undertaking;  NRC,  through  consultation,  shall  work  to  avoid,  minimize,  and/or 
mitigate  those  effects  pursuant  to  the  Section  106  process.  (0019-27  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Comment:  The  Historic  Preservation  Office  (HPO)  provided  comment  on  July  9,  2009  that  the 
Salem  and  Hope  Creek  Generating  Stations  license  renewal  would  not  adversely  effect  historic 
properties.  The  post-license  renewal  activities  (stations  expansion,  access  roads  and  possible 
power  line  upgrades)  were  subject  to  a  separate  review  for  impacts  on  historic  properties.  In 
your  letter  dated  November  5,  2010,  you  have  identified  that  the  license  renewal  and  post¬ 
license  renewal  activities  are  in  fact  one  undertaking.  In  consequence,  the  following

Comment:  800.4  Identifying  Historic  Properties 

The  initial  cultural  resource  surveys  for  expanding  the  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  Generating 
Stations  as  part  of  post-license  renewal  activities  have  identified  the  following  archaeological 
and  historic  properties  within  the  above-referenced  undertaking’s  area  of  potential  effects 
(APE).  Previous  HPO  comment  on  post-license  renewal  activities  is  attached  and  summarized 
below: 

Archaeology 

Proposed  Barge  Facility  and  Water  Intake 

Underwater  survey  identified  four  probably  shipwreck  locations  (Clusters  1 ,  2,  3,  &  4).  If 
avoidance  is  not  possible,  Phase  II  archaeological  survey  will  be  necessary  for  each  cluster  to 
assess  their  eligibility  for  listing  on  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places.  To  date,  the  HPO 
has  not  received  any  site  avoidance  documentation,  avoidance  plan,  or  Phase  II  archaeological 
survey. 

Money  Island  Road  Access  Alternative  Alignment 

Phase  I  archaeological  survey  for  the  proposed  Money  Island  Road  Access  Alternative 
Alignment  identified  the  following  archaeological  sites: 

Sites  28-Sa-179,  28-Sa-180,  28-Sa-182,  28-Sa-183,  and  28-Sa-186 

If  avoidance  is  not  possible,  Phase  II  archaeological  survey  will  be  necessary  for  each  site  to 
assess  their  eligibility  for  listing  on  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places.  To  date,  the  HPO 
has  not  received  any  site  avoidance  documentation,  avoidance  plan,  or  Phase  II  archaeological 
survey. 

Alloway  Creek  Neck  Road  Access  Alternative  Alignment 

Phase  I  archaeological  survey  for  the  proposed  Alloway  Creek  Neck  Road  Access  Alternative 
Alignment  did  not  identify  any  archaeological  deposits  eligible  for  listing  on  the  National  Register 
of  Historic  Places.  In  consequence,  no  additional  archaeological  survey  is  required  unless  the 
alignment,  as  defined  in  the  2009  submission,  changes  in  the  future.  (0021-4  [Brubaker,  Scott])

Appendix  D 


The  submitted  report  does  not  meet  the  NJ  SHPO's  guidelines  for  Architectural  Survey.  The 
methodology  section  of  this  draft  report  notes  that  only  known  properties  listed  on  the  National 
Register  of  Historic  Places  were  considered  for  assessment  of  visual  impacts  within  the  APE. 
Section  106  of  the  National  Historic  Preservation  Act  requires  that  the  applicant  identify  all  listed 
and  eligible  properties  within  the  APE,  and  then  provide  an  assessment  of  effects  and  proposed 
mitigation,  if  applicable,  pursuant  to  36  CFR  Part  800.5.  To  complete  the  Section  106  process, 
the  applicant  must  complete  the  identification  of  historic  properties,  and  then  provide  an 
assessment  of  the  project's  effect  on  the  identified  properties.  (0021-5  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Comment:  In  consequence,  the  HPO  cannot  concur  at  this  time  with  your  November  5,  2010 
letter  stating  that  the  above-referenced  undertaking  will  not  adversely  affect  historic  properties. 
Pursuant  to  36  CFR  Part  800.4,  Phase  II  archaeological  survey  and  intensive  level  architectural 
survey  will  provide  for  evaluation  of  the  National  Register  eligibility  of  the  sites/structures  and 
assessment  of  project  impacts.  For  properties  on  or  eligible  for  National  Register  inclusion, 
recommendations  must  be  provided  for  avoidance  of  impacts.  If  impacts  cannot  be  avoided, 
analyses  must  be  provided  exploring  alternatives  to  minimize  and/or  mitigate  impacts.  Means  to 
avoid,  minimize  and/or  mitigate  impacts  to  National  Register  eligible  properties  will  need  to  be 
developed  and  undertaken  prior  to  project  implementation.  (0021-6  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  As  part  of  its  environmental  review  of  historic  and  cultural  resources,  the  staff  will 
meet  with  the  necessary  State  Historic  Preservation  Offices  (SHPOs)  and  will  review  other 
appropriate  information  sources.  The  results  of  the  analysis  will  be  presented  in  Chapter  4  of 
the  EIS,  and  the  staff  will  take  any  appropriate  action  called  for  as  a  result  this  review.  The 
NRC  will  also  fulfill  its  responsibilities  under  Section  106  of  the  National  Historic  Preservation 
Act  with  regard  to  historic  properties  for  the  project.  The  results  of  the  Section  106  review  will 
also  be  presented  in  the  EIS. 

D.2.14  Comments  Concerning  Meteorology  and  Air  Quality 
Comment:  ER  Page  22  of  42,  Meteorological  Monitoring 

Comment:  Is  there  any  concern  with  the  existing  cement  pad  for  the  main  meteorological  tower 
with  regard  to  stress  cracks  and  integrity?  When  was  the  last  inspection  of  the  tower  pad 
performed?  (0019-9  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Issues  related  to  the  structural  safety  and  integrity  of  the  meteorology  tower  pad  is 
outside  of  the  scope  of  environmental  review.  This  evaluation  can  be  found  in  the  Safety 
Evaluation  Report. 

Comment:  The  Bureau  of  Air  permit  has  reviewed  the  proposed  Early  Site  Permit  application 
for  the  proposed  Nuclear  Reactor  Units  at  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  Generating  Stations.  The 
new  plant  is  proposed  to  have  supporting  equipment  such  as  cooling  towers;  auxiliary  boilers, 
emergency  diesel  generators  and/or  combustion  turbines  that  emit  air  pollutants.  The 
application  gives  details  of  the  expected  size  of  each  piece  of  equipment,  the  stack  height  and 
emissions  from  the  equipment.  These  equipment  will  be  subject  to  Federal  and  State  Air 
Pollution  Control  Regulations  and  requires  air  pollution  control  permits.  PSEG  Nuclear  will  be 
required  to  submit  a  permit  modification  to  incorporate  these  equipment  and  their  associated

emissions  in  the  existing  Title  V  Air  Operating  Permit  for  Hope  Creek  and  Salem  Generating 
Stations.  (0019-10  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  Meteorology  and  air-quality  impacts  resulting  from  the 
construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  facility  will  be  discussed  Chapters  4  and  5  of  the 
EIS. 

Comment:  The  Bureau  of  Technical  Services  (BTS)  has  reviewed  the  air  quality  modeling 
sections  of  the  proposed  Early  Site  Permit  application  for  the  proposed  Nuclear  Reactor  Units  at 
Salem  and  Hope  Creek  Generating  Stations.  These  sections  briefly  describe  the  results  of  a 
preliminary  analysis  of  the  air  quality  impacts  of  the  proposed  changes. 

The  new  equipment  being  proposed  that  emit  air  pollutants  (cooling  towers;  auxiliary  boilers, 
emergency  diesel  generators  and/or  combustion  turbines)  will  require  a  detailed  modeling 
analysis  of  their  impact  on  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxides,  PM-10,  and  PM-2.S  air  quality.  This 
modeling  must  be  part  of  their  air  permit  application  that  incorporates  the  new  equipment  into 
the  existing  Title  V  Air  Operating  Permit  for  Hope  Creek  and  Salem  Generating  Stations.  Prior 
to  submittal  of  the  modeling  analysis,  a  modeling  protocol  which  describes  the  techniques  and 
modeling  assumption  which  will  be  used  should  be  submitted  to  BTS  prior  to  submittal  of  the 
modeling  analysis.  Note  that  the  modeling  analysis  must  address  the  new  l-hour  sulfur  dioxide 
National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standard.  (0019-11  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  Comment  noted.  Meteorology  and  air-quality  impacts  resulting  from  the 
construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  facility  will  be  discussed  Chapters  4  and  5  of  the 
EIS.

Comment 

Section  40  CFR  93.150  (a)  (Prohibition)  of  the  Federal  General  Conformity  regulation  states, 

"No  department,  agency  or  instrumentality  of  the  Federal  Government  shall  engage  in,  support 
in  any  way  or  provide  financial  assistance  for,  license  or  permit,  or  approve  any  activity  which 
does  not  conform  to  an  applicable  implementation  plan." 

Also,  Section  40  CFR  93.150  (b)  of  the  Federal  General  Conformity  regulation  states,  "A 
Federal  agency  must  make  a  determination  that  a  Federal  action  conforms  to  the  applicable 
implementation  plan  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  this  subpart  before  the  action  is 
taken."  The  Federal  General  Conformity  regulation  requires  that  a  General  Conformity 
Applicability  Analysis  for  ozone  (Volatile  Organic  Compounds  (VOCs)  and  Oxides  of  Nitrogen 
(NOx))  and  if  necessary  a  Conformity  Determination  is  needed  for  this  project.

In  addition,  Sections  93.153(b)  and  (1)  (Applicability)  in  the  Federal  General  Conformity 
regulation  states,  11  ...  a  conformity  determination  is  required  for  each  criteria  pollutant  or 
precursor  where  the  total  direct  or  indirect  emissions  of  the  criteria  pollutant  or  precursor  in  a 
nonattainment  or  maintenance  area  caused  by  a  Federal  action  would  equal  or  exceed  any  of 
the  rates  in  paragraphs  (b)  (1 )  of  this  section.”  Under  the  1-hour  Ozone  National  Ambient  Air 
Quality  Standards  (NAAQS),  the  Philadelphia-Wilmington-  Atlantic  City  (PA-DE-MD-NJ) 
nonattainment  area  was  classified  as  a  "severe"  nonattainment  area.  Under  this  classification, 
the  de  minimis  level  for  Oxides  of  Nitrogen  (NOx)  is  25  tons  per  year  (tpy)  and  the  de  minimis 
level  for  Volatile  Organic  Compounds  (VOCs)  is  25  tpy.  The  State  of  New  Jersey  continues  to 
be  in  nonattainment  for  the  8-hour  ozone  NAAQS.  In  order  to  prevent  backsliding  and  to  meet 
the  goal  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  (42  U.S.C.  7502(e))  to  achieve  attainment  of  the  Ozone  NAAQS,  it 
is  necessary  to  use  the  de  minimis  emissions  levels  established  for  General  Conformity  projects 
under  the  1-hour  Ozone  NAAQS  at  (40  CFR  93. 1 53(b)(1 ).  When  preparing  the  Applicability 
Analysis,  please  use  the  de  minimis  levels  for  the  1-hour  Ozone  NAAQS. 

In  addition,  Section  93.158  (d)  of  the  Federal  General  Conformity  regulation  states,  "Any 
analyses  required  under  this  section  must  be  completed,  and  any  mitigation  requirements 
necessary  for  a  finding  of  conformity  must  be  identified  before  the  determination  of  conformity  is 
made.”  A  mitigation  plan  will  be  required  for  criteria  pollutant  emissions  and  precursors  above 
the  1-hour  de  minimis  levels.  (0019-12  [Brubaker.  Scott])

The  ESP  states,  "Construction  activities  result  in  increased  air  emissions.  Earthmoving  and 
material  handling  activities  may  generate  fugitive  dust  and  fine  particulate  matter.  Vehicles  and 
engine-driven  equipment  (e.g.  generators  and  compressors)  generate  combustion  product 
emissions  such  as  carbon  monoxide,  nitrogen  oxides  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  sulfur  dioxides. 
Painting,  coating  and  similar  operations  also  generate  emissions  from  the  use  of  volatile  organic 
compounds."

Comment:  1 5)  Environmental  Report,  Chapter  10,  Page  10.1-11  Table  10.1-1  Construction- 
Related  Unavoidable  Adverse  Environmental  Impacts 

Table  10.1-1  of  the  ESP  indicates  that  "the  atmospheric  and  meteorological  impacts  of  the 
project  include  an  increase  in  dust  and  emissions  from  construction  equipment  and  construction 
workforce  vehicles  occurs.  The  mitigation  measures  in  Table  10.1-1  include  BMPs  for 
controlling  fugitive  dust  and  proper  maintenance  of  construction  equipment  and  vehicles  is  used 
to  control  air  emissions.” 

Comment 

Comment  1  (above)  also  applies  to  this  portion  of  the  project.  (0019-20  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  These  comments  refer  to  the  NJDEQ's  assertion  that  the  proposed  action  must 
comply  with  the  Federal  General  Conformity  Act  (40  CFR  93. 150),  which  addresses  air  pollution 
emissions.  The  NRC  will  conduct  a  conformity  determination  under  40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B, 
outside  of  the  NFPA  process  to  determine  whether  additional  mitigation  is  warranted.  * 

*Subsequent  to  the  issuance  of  the  Scoping  Summary  Report,  NRC  determined  the  following:  The 
Federal  action  of  issuing  an  ESP  with  no  Limited  Work  Authorization  for  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  directly 
or  indirectly  cause  any  emissions,  and  therefore,  an  applicability  analysis  and  potential  conformity 
determination  will  not  be  performed  at  this  time.  Compliance  with  40  CFR  Part  93,  Subpart  B,  will  be 
demonstrated  when  a  CP,  an  OL,  or  a  COL  is  submitted  to  the  NRC.

D.2.16  Comments  Concerning  Health — Radiological 
Comment:  ER  Page  27  of  136-Hydrological  Alterations 

"Dredged  material  removed  as  part  of  this  construction  activity  will  be  transported  to  and  placed 
in  an  on-site  or  other  approved  upland  disposal  facility." 

Does  the  licensee  plan  on  expanding  the  REMP  program  to  include  air  particulate/iodine 
monitoring,  surface  water  runoff,  or  soil  sampling  in  the  area  of  this  CDP  (if  onsite  area  is  used 
for  materials)?  An  air  monitoring  site  should  be  placed  downwind  of  the  CDP  based  on  annual 
meteorological  direction  (SE).  Also,  will  there  be  expanded  ground  water  monitoring  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  CDF? 

Once  complete,  sampling  locations  near  the  intake  and  discharge  canals  will  be  needed, 
especially  for  media  such  as  aquatic  biota  and  sediment.  Since  the  structures  are  upstream  in 
the  Delaware,  PSEG  will  need  to  rethink  their  exiting  collection  location  north  of  the  plant  that  is 
considered,  'control'.  This  site  may  need  to  be  moved  further  upstream.  (0019-3  [Brubaker, 

Scott]) 

Comment:  ER  Page  13  of  42,  Radiological  Environmental  Monitoring  Program,  Table  6.2-1 

Comment:  The  NJBNE  is  requesting  that  the  licensee  consider  increasing  the  REMP  sample 
frequency  from  quarter  annual  to  monthly,  based  on  the  public  interest  of  tritium  contamination 
in  groundwater  in  New  Jersey.  Samples  of  groundwater,  including  local  drinking  water  wells, 
are  collected  in  order  to  provide  assurance  to  the  public  that  these  water  resources  are  not 
impacted.  (0019-8  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Comment:  ER  Page  12  of  42,  Section  6  -Environmental  Measurements  and  Monitoring 
Programs 

6.2.2. 1  Radiological  Monitoring  Program 

"The  existing  PSEG  REMP  serves  as  the  new  plant  construction/preoperational  radiological 
monitoring  program.  Additional  on-site  thermoluminescent  dosimetry  (TLD)  monitoring  locations 
will  be  added  to  the  north  of  the  HCGS  to  support  the  ODCM/REMP  for  the  construction  and 
preoperational  period.  A  description  of  the  new  monitoring  locations  and  other  applicable 
parameters  will  be  provided  in  the  combined  license  (COL)  application." 

Comment:  The  NJBNE  requests  that  the  licensee  establish  a  Groundwater  Protection  Program 
for  the  proposed  site  at  the  construction/pre-operational  stage  rather  than  waiting  for  the 
operation  of  the  facility.  During  the  construction  phase,  there  will  be  knowledge  as  to  where  all 
applicable  tanks  and  pipes  are  going  to  be  located,  along  with  buildings  containing  radioactive 
fluids  and  areas  of  further  investigation  for  potential  tritium  in  groundwater.  (0019-6  [Brubaker, 
Scott]) 

Response:  Impacts  to  ground  and  surface  water  as  result  of  construction  and  operation, 
including  potential  tritium  releases,  of  the  proposed  facility  will  be  discussed  in  Sections  4.3  and 
5.3  of  the  EIS.  In  addition,  the  Radiological  Environmental  Monitoring  Program  (REMP)  and

D.2.20  Comments  Concerning  the  Uranium  Fuel  Cycle 

Comment:  Is  the  current  Independent  Spent  Fuel  Storage  Installation  (ISFSI)  capable  of 
providing  storage  for  all  three  nuclear  generating  stations  (Salem  1  &  2  and  Hope  Creek)  plus 
the  proposed  new  plant?  Will  there  be  an  addition  to  the  existing  pad  or  will  a  separate  new  pad 
be  built?  How  will  the  cumulative  effects  of  all  this  storage  of  spent  fuel  be  assessed?  In  the 
Early  Site  Permit  SEIS?  (0021-1  [Brubaker,  Scott]) 

Response:  .  The  Commission  has  made  a  generic  determination  that,  if  necessary,  spent  fuel 
generated  in  any  reactor  can  be  stored  safely  and  without  significant  environmental  impacts  for 
at  least  60  years  beyond  the  licensed  life  for  operation  (which  may  include  the  term  of  a  revised 
or  renewed  license)  of  that  reactor  in  a  combination  of  storage  in  its  spent  fuel  storage  basin 
and  at  either  onsite  or  offsite  independent  spent  fuel  storage  installations.  Section  5. 9  of  the 
EIS  will  discuss  radiological  impacts  during  operation  of  the  proposed  new  facility  including  the 
storage  of  spent  fuel.  The  NRC  will  discuss  potential  cumulative  impacts  in  Chapter  7  of  the 
EIS,  based  on  the  plant  parameter  envelope  established  for  the  site. 

Comment:  We  worried  about  safety  issues,  and  even  more,  about  the  lack  of  a  long-  term  safe 
repository  for  nuclear  wastes.  We  weren't  experts,  our  concerns  were  real.  (0001-10-3 
[Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  In  fact,  if  you  have  had  an  opportunity,  I  have  been  to  Yucca  Mountain  four  times. 
And  I  have  watched  that  develop,  and  know  the  need  that  we  have  of  the  right  place  for  a  waste 
disposal  plant.  (0001-13-3  [Salmon,  Edward]) 

Comment:  The  storage  of  spent  fuel  is  widely  thought  to  be  a  hazard.  But  a  recent  proposal 
from  the  Health  Physics  Society,  which  is  the  professional  scientific  society  of  radiation  safety 
officers,  states  that  dry  cask  storage  of  spent  fuel  for  several  hundred  years,  will  reduce  its 
radioactivity  to  the  point  where  reprocessing  would  not  be  difficult. 

And  this  very  valuable  fuel  could  then  be  reused.  This  interim  storage  would  eliminate  the 
necessity  for  storing  large  masses  of  radioactive  material  in  a  site  like  Yucca  Mountain,  where  it 
must  remain  physically  and  chemically  stable  for  hundreds  of  thousands  of  years.  And  the  NRC 
has  already  approved  the  safety  of  dry  casks.  (0001-5-6  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  And  then  another  concern  with  nuclear  is  also  the  waste  that  is  produced  by  the 
facility.  The  half  life  of  nuclear  materials,  like  the  100,000  years,  which  is  basically  how  much  it 
will  degrade  in  its  nuclear  power.  Well,  the  problem  is  you  have  to  worry  about  this  nuclear 
waste  forever.  And  maintain  it,  and  make  sure  it  is  safe.  If  you  don't  produce  nuclear  waste  you 
don't  have  to  worry  about  it.  And  we  do  have  a  problem  with  nuclear  waste  in  this  country. 
Salem  is  storing  some  there  and,  you  know,  it  is  a  concern.  (0002-6-5  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Comment:  We  worried  about  safety  issues  and  even  more  about  the  lack  of  a  long-  term  safe 
repository  for  nuclear  wastes.  We  were  not  experts.  The  concerns  are  real.  (0010-3  [Applegate,

Response:  The  NRC  staff  will  assess  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  uranium  fuel  cycle, 
including  the  impacts  of  solid  radioactive  waste  management  in  Chapter  6  of  the  EIS.  The  NRC 
staff  will  assess  the  environmental  impacts  of  accidents  in  Chapter  5  of  the  EIS.  The 
Commission  has  made  a  generic  determination  that,  if  necessary,  spent  fuel  generated  in  any 
reactor  can  be  stored  safely  and  without  significant  environmental  impacts  for  at  least  60 years 
beyond  the  licensed  life  for  operation  (which  may  include  the  term  of  a  revised  or  renewed 
license)  of  that  reactor  in  a  combination  of  storage  in  its  spent  fuel  storage  basin  and  at  either 
onsite  or  offsite  independent  spent  fuel  storage  installations.  Further,  the  Commission  believes 
there  is  reasonable  assurance  that  sufficient  mined  geologic  repository  capacity  will  be  available 
to  dispose  of  the  commercial  high-level  radioactive  waste  and  spent  fuel  generated  in  any 
reactor  when  necessary  (75  FR  81037). 

D.2.25  Comments  Concerning  Cumulative  Impacts 

Comment:  To  many  environmental  groups  renewable  energy  is  a  preferable  alternative  to 
nuclear  reactors.  To  those  concerned  with  the  conservation  of  biological  diversity,  however,  the 
cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  large  scale,  renewable  projects,  will  be  their  most  detrimental 
effect.  We  believe  that  concerns  for  the  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  the  alternatives,  wind, 
solar,  and  biomass,  should  be  included  in  the  final  EIS,  as  a  reason  for  rejecting  them  as  an 
alternative  to  nuclear  power.  (0001-6-7  [Lewis,  Kenneth]) 

Comment:  In  addition,  I  urge  that  the  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  alternative  energy 
generating  sources  be  included  in  the  Environmental  Impact  Statement,  in  order  to  show  that, 
by  comparison,  nuclear  energy  is  far  preferable,  is  a  far  preferable  option.  (0001-7-4  [Eastman, 
Ajax]) 

Response:  The  cumulative  impacts  associated  with  alternative  energy  sources  will  be 
discussed  in  EIS  Chapter  9. 

Comment:  This  meeting  is  about  the  environmental  impact  of  a  new  facility.  And  my 
comments  cover  a  variety  of  issues  that  I  feel  are  important  to  bring  up,  and  have  on  the  record, 
also,  pertaining  to  the  new  facility,  and  the  existing  complex,  which  must  also  be  considered,  as 
a  whole,  when  you  add  one  more  to  three  existing,  it  is  a  bigger  picture,  and  a  bigger  effect. 
(0002-6-1  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Response:  These  comments  allude  to  cumulative  impacts,  which  are  impacts  that  result  from 
the  combination  of  a  proposed  action  with  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  actions, 
regardless  of  who  takes  the  actions.  The  cumulative  impacts  associated  with  issuing  the 
proposed  ESP  for  the  existing  Salem/Hope  Creek  site  will  be  evaluated  for  each  affected 
resource.  The  results  of  cumulative  impact  analyses  will  be  presented  in  EIS  Chapter  7. 

Comment:  With  the  new  facility  a  good  thing  is,  if  it  is  built,  that  it  would  have  a  closed  loop 
cooling  system,  which  would  greatly  reduce  the  amount  of  water  needed  to  cool  the  facility.  A 
closed  loop  cooling  system  reduces  the  water  take,  compared  to  an  open  loop  system,  by  90  to 
95  percent.  So  however,  an  average  nuclear  facility  draws  in,  an  open  loop  system,  like  a  billion 
gallons  of  water  a  day,  over  a  billion.  So  even  with  the  closed  loop,  you  are  still  talking  about 
50  million  to  100  million  of  gallons  a  day.  So  you  would  be  adding  to  the  amount  of  fish  that  are 


November  2015 


D-91 


NUREG-2168 


Appendix  D 


killed  at  that  facility.  So  you  must  consider  the  existing  damage  that  the  present  facility,  Salem  I 
and  II  causes,  and  adding  even  more  damage.  And  Salem  I  and  II  draws  in  three  billion  gallons 
of  water  a  day,  every  day.  And  it  kills  billions  of  fish.  And  the  EPA  has  estimates  on  how  much. 
And  I  have  a  paper  I  would  like  to  submit  as  data.  And  they  kill  350  million  age  one  equivalent 
fish.  In  other  words,  fish  that  would  have  grown  up  to  be  a  million,  I  mean,  one  year  old.  That  is 
how  they  generally  use  their  fish  kill  data;  they  call  it  age  one  equivalent  fish.  But,  actually,  the 
facility  kills  billions  of  fish,  billions  of  smaller  fish,  which  is  the  food  chain  for  the  bigger  fish,  and 
the  whole  ecosystem.  So  my  concern  here  is  that  you  want  to  build  a  new  facility,  but  you  are 
not  stopping  the  existing  damage  caused  by  the  present  facility  that  is  there,  units  I  and  II,  which 
draw  in  three  billion  gallons  of  water,  and  have  an  open  loop  cooling  system.  So  before  you 
consider  building  a  new  facility  you  should  stop  the  damage  caused  by  the  existing  facility,  first. 

I  think  that  is  a  priority.  But  it  seems  like  just  build  another  one.  But  you  still  have  an  existing 
fish  kill  facility,  there.  And  it  kills  all  species,  all  ages.  And  it  is  destroying  the  fishing  industry 
along  the  Delaware  Bay  and  the  Delaware  River.  We  used  to  have  a  great  fishing  industry,  and 
we  don't  now.  Not  when  one  facility  draws  in  three  billion  gallons  of  water  a  day.  And  Salem 
says  we  fixed  up  some  wetlands  and  that  will  compensate.  It  is  really  hard  to  believe  that  fixing 
up  a  few  acres  of  wetlands  will  compensate  for  billions  of  fish  killed,  every  year,  year  after  year. 
So  I  feel  that  you  should  fix  the  first  two,  units  Salem  I  and  II,  and  then  consider  moving  on. 
(0002-6-11  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Comment:  And  I  spoke  with  some  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  people  tonight.  And  I  have 
a  major  concern,  that  when  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  does  an  evaluation  of  an 
existing  permit,  or  a  new  permit,  the  issue  of  water  intake,  for  the  cooling  system,  is  left  up  to 
the  state,  as  a  state  permit.  I  spoke  with  a  gentleman  from  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission, 
and  he  says  it  is  above  his  ability  to  change  the  rulings,  that  the  EPA  has  made  about  this  issue. 
But  I  feel  that  it  should  be  part  of  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission's  when  they  evaluate  the 
water  intake,  for  two  reasons.  Because  NRC  is  a  nuclear,  is  a  federal  agency.  A  federal 
agency  applies  to  any  issue  that  affects  more  than  one  state.  The  fish  kill  caused  by  these 
facilities  affects  more  than  one  state,  it  affects  the  fishermen  in  Delaware,  in  Maryland,  in 
Pennsylvania,  in  New  Jersey,  and  all  up  and  down  the  coast,  where  the  fish  would  have  gone, 
and  traveled,  and  be  caught  by  other  people.  So  therefore  the  NRC  needs  to  be  involved  with  a 
federal  ruling  on  it,  and  not  be  involved  with  the  water  permit.  So  I'm  asking  the  NRC  to  talk  to 
the  people  above  them  to  pursue  that.  (0002-6-17  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Comment:  And  then,  also,  the  Federal  Clean  Water  Act  applies  to  the  fish  kill.  In  the  1970s 
the  Federal  Clean  Water  Act,  said  that  you  must  use  the  best  technology  available  to  stop  the 
fish  kill.  This  facility,  Salem  I  and  II,  is  killing  the  fish.  And  they  are  not  using  the  best  available 
technology.  So,  therefore,  the  federal  agency  overseeing  the  nuclear  plant,  which  is  the  NRC, 
needs  to  enforce  that  particular  law.  It  is  a  federal  law,  the  Clean  Water  Act.  So,  again,  I  ask 
the  NRC  to  pursue  having  open  or  closed  loop  systems.  (0002-6-19  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Response:  These  comments  allude  to  cumulative  impacts  on  aquatic  resources,  which  are 
impacts  that  result  from  the  combination  of  a  proposed  action  with  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  actions,  regardless  of  who  takes  the  actions.  The  cumulative  impacts 
associated  with  issuing  the  proposed  ESP  will  be  evaluated  for  each  affected  resource, 
including  aquatic  resources.  The  results  of  cumulative  impact  analyses  will  be  presented  in  EIS 
Chapter  7.

Appendix  D 


Comment:  There  are  two  key  sections  in  every  EIS:  The  first  is  an  analysis  of  the  cumulative 
impacts  of  the  proposed  action,  and  the  second  is  an  analysis  of  alternatives  to  the  proposed 
action.  Thus,  the  dEIS  states:  Cumulative  impacts  result  when  the  effects  of  an  action  are 
added  to  or  interact  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  effects  on  the 
same  resources.  And  further:  These  combined  impacts  ...  include  individually  minor  but 
collectively  potentially  significant  actions  taking  place  over  a  period  of  time.  To  many 
environmental  groups  renewable  energy  is  a  preferable  alternative  to  reactors.  To  those 
concerned  with  the  conservation  of  biological  diversity,  however,  the  cumulative  ecological 
impacts  of  large-scale  renewable  projects  will  be  their  most  detrimental  effect.  We  believe  that 
concern  for  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  the  Alternatives,  wind,  solar,  and  biomass  should 
be  included  in  the  final  EIS  as  a  reason  for  rejecting  them  as  an  alternative.  (0007-6  [Lewis, 
Kenneth]) 

Comment:  In  addition,  I  urge  that  the  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  alternative  energy 
generating  sources  be  included  in  the  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (EIS)  in  order  to  show 
that  by  comparison  nuclear  energy  is  a  far  preferable  option.  (0012-5  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Response:  The  cumulative  impacts  associated  with  alternative  energy  sources  will  be 
discussed  in  EIS  Chapter  9. 

D.2.26  Comments  Concerning  the  Need  for  Power 

Comment:  We  need  to  keep  pace  with  our  state's  energy  needs.  The  U.S.  Department  of 
Energy  predicts  that  the  national  electrical  demand  will  increase  28  percent  by  2035,  and  to 
maintain  nuclear  energy's  current  20  percent  contribution,  which  they  do  today,  we  must  build 
about  one  new  reactor  per  year,  starting  in  2016.  (0001-13-13  [Salmon,  Edward]) 

Response:  This  comment  affirms  the  need  to  build  new  capacity  to  keep  pace  with  the  nation's 
energy  needs  and  suggests  nuclear  should  continue  to  constitute  a  constant  share  of  this 
capacity.  NRC's  assessment  of  Need  for  Power  will  be  discussed  in  detail  in  Chapter  8  of  the 
EIS. 

Comment:  New  Jersey  Nuclear  Power  supplies  the  state  of  New  Jersey  with  about  52  percent 
of  its  electric  needs.  It  is  important  in  meeting  electric  demand,  of  not  only  the  state,  but  the 
region  also.  Producing  this  electricity  with  nuclear  power  is  done  without  creating  greenhouse 
gases,  which  is  an  important  and  critical  component  to  this  discussion,  given  the  global  warming 
situation.  Equally  important  is  that  there  is  no  impact  on  the  local  environment.  Without  these 
plants  the  reliability  of  electric  delivery  to  meet  demand,  would  be  put  at  risk.  As  demand 
increases,  we  must  consider  the  need  for  another  nuclear  power  plant.  (0001-17-9  [Hassler, 
Charles]) 

Response:  This  comment  describes  a  number  of  reasons  that  nuclear  power  should  be 
considered  as  a  source  of  new  capacity  in  the  New  Jersey  Region.  The  balance  of  benefits  and 
costs  will  be  considered  in  Chapter  10  in  the  EIS. 

Comment:  At  the  May  4th,  2010  public  meeting  that  NRC  held  on  the  project  I  commented  on 
the  importance  of  providing  additional  electrical  generating  capacity  to  meet  the  energy  needs  of 
New  Jersey  residents  and  businesses.  These  comments  are,  of  course,  still  applicable,

especially  the  need  to  provide  base  load  generating  capacity,  supplemented  by  renewable 
energy  projects,  such  as  wind  and  solar,  in  New  Jersey.  (0001-8-3  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Response:  This  comment  provides  a  general  need  for  additional  generating  capacity  in  the 
New  Jersey  region  and  the  desirability  of  a  portfolio  of  capacity  containing  nuclear  and 
renewable  energy  sources.  Capacity  requirements  will  be  discussed  in  Chapter  8  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  This  facility  is  critical  to  the  State  of  New  Jersey  for  its  energy  needs.  And  as  we 
move  forward,  and  we  know  it  is  going  to  take  some  time  to  build,  I'm  excited  that  we  are  finally 
starting  it.  I  think  it  took  them  eight  years  too  long  to  get  started,  but  we  started.  (0002-1-2 
[Sweeney,  Steve]) 

Response:  This  comment  offers  general  support  for  the  construction  of  the  proposed  facility 
and  notes  the  lead  time  required  for  such  a  construction  project.  This  comment  will  not  be 
discussed  specifically  in  the  EIS,  but  the  project's  background,  including  length  of  the 
construction  period,  will  be  discussed  in  Chapter  7  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  And  my  final  point  is  that  I'm  very  familiar  with  the  efforts  to  pursue  renewable 
energy  off  the  coast  of  New  Jersey,  including  wind,  wave,  and  tidal  energy.  These  are  in  the 
nascent  stages  of  development.  But  if  you  look  at  the  projected  production,  energy  production 
from  these  sources,  it  certainly  will  not  meet  the  future  demand  for  our  state,  which  continues  to 
grow,  as  we  continue  to  develop.  (0002-4-8  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Response:  This  comment  suggests  that  a  number  of  advanced  renewable  energy  sources  will 
be  insufficient  to  meet  power  needs  in  the  New  Jersey  region.  Capacity  requirements  will  be 
discussed  in  Chapter  8  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  And  we  feel  that  it  is  important  to  develop  nuclear  power  generation,  and  feel  that 
siting  a  plant,  here  in  an  area  that  is  already  dedicated  to  producing  nuclear  power,  is  a 
particularly  efficient  way  to  do  it,  because  it  takes  advantage  of  the  infrastructure  that  is  already 
in  place,  for  the  plants  that  exist  there  now.  (0002-5-4  [Duvall,  Brian]) 

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  support  for  the  construction  of  additional  power 
generation  units  at  the  existing  PS  EG  Site,  noting  they  will  take  advantage  of  existing 
infrastructure.  Site  attributes  will  be  discussed  in  detail  in  Chapter  2  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  And  one  other  thing,  the  power  that  is  produced  by  this  facility  is  sold  wholesale;  it 
is  on  the  PGM  grid,  which  includes  power  plants  in  13  states,  and  50  million  people.  They  are 
wholesale  producers  of  electricity.  It  just  doesn't  go  to  the  people  of  New  Jersey.  The  people  of 
New  Jersey  buy  their  power  on  the  wholesale  market,  like  everybody  else  in  the  PGM  grid.  So 
it  is  slightly  misleading  to  say  the  power  generated  in  New  Jersey  comes,  so  much  percentage 
comes  from  the  Salem  Nuclear  Plant.  That  power  they  produce  goes  to  1 3  different  states.  So 
if  that  unit  IV  is  not  built,  the  people  in  New  Jersey  will  still  get  power  from  all  the  other  facilities 
in  the  PGM  grid.  And  that  is  an  important  aspect  that  a  lot  of  people  don't  know  about. 

(0002-6-21  [Schneider,  Richard])

New  Jersey.  The  nature  of  the  power  grid  and  circumstances  relevant  to  the  New  Jersey  region 
will  be  discussed  in  Chapter  8  of  the  E IS. 

Comment:  The  key  thing  I  think,  when  I  take  a  look  at  the  energy  question  that  we  have  in  the 
United  States,  has  to  do  with  coal  generation,  and  the  fact  that  fewer  and  fewer  coal  generated 
facilities  are  going  to  be  used  in  our  future.  Whether  Cap  and  Trade  passes  or  not,  coal 
generation  is  on  the  way  out.  And  what  is  going  to  replace  it?  At  Mannington  Mills  we  have 
solar  generation,  and  I'm  very  proud  of  what  we  have  been  able  to  do  with  that.  But,  quite 
frankly,  that  solar  generation  would  not  be  economical  unless  the  federal  government  had  heavy 
tax  subsidies,  in  order  to  make  it  happen.  The  same  thing  has  to  do  with  wind.  And  while  I 
think  the  solar  and  wind  generation  title,  etcetera,  is  wonderful,  sustainable  and  good,  we  have 
to  have  large  generation  of  fossil  free,  in  order  for  us  to  be  able  to  get  environmental  goal  posts 
that  we  would  like  to  hit  as  a  society.  And,  obviously,  I'm  here  tonight  saying  I  think  nuclear  is  a 
very,  very  good  alternative.  And  I  have  a  high  degree  of  confidence  in  the  fact  that  PSEG  can 
deliver.  (0002-8-2  [Campbell,  Keith]) 

Response:  This  comment  describes  issues  associated  with  several  alternative  sources  of 
power  for  the  New  Jersey  region.  These  and  related  issues  will  be  discussed  in  detail  in 
Chapters  8,  9,  and  10  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  We  need  to  keep  pace  with  our  state's  energy  needs.  The  U.S.  Department  of 
Energy  projects  that  national  electricity  demand  will  increase  28  percent  by  2035,  and  to 
maintain  nuclear  energy's  current  20  percent  contribution,  we  must  build  about  one  new  reactor 
per  year  starting  in  2016.  New  wind  and  solar  power  will  definitely  play  a  part  in  our  energy 
future,  but  the  simple  nature  of  their  intermittency  requires  something  more.  The  New  Jersey 
Energy  Coalition  supports  the  development  of  a  new  nuclear  facility  here  in  Salem  County  as  it 
will  help  mitigate  rising  energy  demand  with  a  clean  power  source  that  fuels  job  growth  and 
strengthens  our  economy.  (0004-6  [Salmon,  Edward]) 

Comment:  And,  the  power  generated  by  the  new  plant  will  help  meet  the  ever  growing  energy 
demand.  (0006-4  [Patouhas,  Maria]) 

Response:  These  comments  note  the  general  need  for  additional  generating  capacity  in  the 
New  Jersey  region  and  the  desirability  of  a  portfolio  of  capacity  containing  nuclear  and 
renewable  energy  sources.  Need  for  power  will  be  discussed  in  Chapter  8  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Nuclear  power  supplies  the  State  of  New  Jersey  with  about  52%  of  its  electric 
needs.  It  is  important  in  meeting  the  energy  demand  of  not  only  the  State  and  but  the  region  as 
well.  Producing  this  electricity  with  Nuclear  power  is  done  without  creating  greenhouse  gases, 
which  is  an  important  and  critical  component  to  this  discussion,  given  the  global  warming 
situation.  Equally  important  is  that  there  is  no  impact  on  the  local  environment.  (0005-3  [Hassler, 
Charles]) 

Response:  This  comment  provides  general  support  for  nuclear  power  in  the  New  Jersey

specifically  in  the  EIS,  but  a  discussion  of  the  balance  between  benefits  and  costs  of  the 
proposed  facility  will  be  discussed  in  Chapter  10  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Without  these  plants  the  reliability  of  the  electric  delivery  to  meet  demand  would  be 
put  at  risk.  As  demand  increases,  we  must  consider  the  need  for  another  nuclear  power  plant. 
(0005-5  [Hassler,  Charles]) 

Comment:  At  the  May  4,  2010  public  meeting  that  the  NRC  held  on  this  project  I  commented 
on  the  importance  of  providing  additional  electrical  generation  capacity  to  meet  the  energy 
needs  of  New  Jersey  residents  and  businesses.  Those  comments  are  still  applicable  especially 
the  need  to  provide  base  load  generating  capacity  supplemented  by  renewable  energy  projects 
such  as  wind  and  solar  in  New  Jersey.  (0011-4  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Response:  These  comments  note  the  need  to  increase  generating  capacity  to  maintain  electric 
reliability  in  the  face  of  increasing  demand  for  power.  Need  for  Power  will  be  addressed  in 
detail  in  Chapter  8  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Nuclear  energy  now  supplies  over  50%  of  our  state's  energy  needs  and  it  is 
recognized  an  efficient,  clean,  low  carbon  form  of  energy  production;  our  needs  for  energy 
continues  to  grow.  (0008-2  [Lacandro,  Roger]) 

Response:  This  comment  notes  the  general  attributes  of  nuclear  power  that  makes  it  attractive 
as  a  power  source.  This  comment  will  not  be  discussed  specifically,  but  a  balance  of  the 
benefits  and  costs  associated  with  the  proposed  power  plant  will  be  contained  in  Chapter  10  of 
the  EIS. 

D.2.28  Comments  Concerning  Alternatives — Energy 

Comment:  First,  let's  reduce  our  demand  for  energy.  More  efficient  fuel  construction  in  the 
transportation  sector,  better  construction  design,  both  in  new  construction  and  retrofitting 
existing  living  and  working  spaces,  were  top  candidates.  We  recognized,  however,  that  the 
economics  of  inexpensive  fossil  fuels  made  voluntary  action  unlikely  without  government 
incentives.  (0001-10-1  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  New  Jersey  Nuclear  Power  supplies  the  state  of  New  Jersey  with  about  52  percent 
of  its  electric  needs.  It  is  important  in  meeting  electric  demand,  of  not  only  the  state,  but  the 
region  also.  Producing  this  electricity  with  nuclear  power  is  done  without  creating  greenhouse 
gases,  which  is  an  important  and  critical  component  to  this  discussion,  given  the  global  warming 
situation.  Equally  important  is  that  there  is  no  impact  on  the  local  environment.  Without  these 
plants  the  reliability  of  electric  delivery  to  meet  demand,  would  be  put  at  risk.  (0001-17-4 
[Hassler,  Charles]) 

Comment:  In  the  case  of  global  warming  our  solutions  fell  into  3  categories:  First:  Reduce  our 
demand  for  energy.  More  efficient  fuel  consumption  in  the  transportation  sector  and  better 
construction  design  -both  in  new  construction  and  in  retrofitting  existing  living  and  working 
spaces  -were  top  candidates.  We  recognized,  however,  that  the  economics  of  inexpensive 
fossil  fuels  made  voluntary  action  unlikely  without  government  incentives.

Second:  Bringing  more  renewable  energy  sources  on  line.  Here  we  liked  solar  energy,  wind 
energy  and  biofuels.  At  the  time  we  were  discussing  these  ideas  we  had  only  limited 
experience  with  these  technologies.  Experience  over  the  past  decade  tells  us  that  each  of 
these  solutions  comes  with  a  cost.  We  cover  fragile  desert  habitats  with  solar  panels  while 
ignoring  the  warehouse  rooftops  and  other  existing  opportunities  that  have  much  less  impact. 
Wind  energy  leaves  a  construction  and  service  footprint  at  the  expense  of  wildlife  habitats  and 
operation  can  have  serious  impacts  on  mortality  of  migrating  birds.  Land  growing  biofuels  has 
very  limited  wildlife  habitat  value.  Barry  Commoner  was  right  -There  is  no  such  thing  as  a  free 
lunch. 

Our  third  option  was  a  re-examination  of  nuclear  power  generation  -a  technology  not  considered 
a  part  of  the  package  while  we  taught  the  course,  but  evidently  back  on  the  table  as  evidenced 
by  this  hearing.  We  recognized  the  value  of  generating  usable  energy  without  increasing 
greenhouse  gases.  (0010-1  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Response:  The  NRC  is  not  involved  in  establishing  energy  policy;  rather,  it  regulates  nuclear 
energy  to  protect  public  health  and  safety  within  existing  policy.  While  energy  efficiency 
measures  could  reduce  demand  in  the  PSEG  service  area,  in  accordance  with  NUREG-1555  a 
merchant  plant  is  not  required  to  perform  a  demand-side  management  analysis  or  consider 
measures  to  increase  energy  efficiency  as  an  alternative  to  the  proposed  action.  Chapter  9  of 
the  EIS  will  describe  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  alternative  energy  sources, 
including  fossil  fuels  and  renewable  sources  of  energy. 

Comment:  Our  second  class  of  solutions  was  bringing  more  renewable  energy  sources  online. 
Here  we  liked  solar  energy,  wind  energy,  and  biofuels.  At  the  time  we  were  discussing  these 
ideas,  we  had  only  limited  experience  with  these  technologies.  Experience,  over  the  past

birds.  Land  growing  biofuels  have  very  limited  wildlife  habitat  value.  Barry  Commoner  was 
right,  50  years  ago,  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  free  lunch.  (0001-10-2  [Applegate.  Jim]) 

Comment:  Our  third  option  was  reexamination  of  nuclear  power  generation.  A  technology  not 
considered  a  part  of  the  package  while  we  taught  that  course  but,  evidently,  back  on  the  table, 
as  evidenced  by  this  hearing.  We  recognized  the  value  of  generating  large  amounts  of  usable 
energy  without  increasing  greenhouse  gases.  (0001-10-4  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  Salem  County  is  now  recognized  as  the  alternative  energy  capital  of  the  northeast. 
Not  only  are  we  fortunate  enough  to  have  three  operating  nuclear  plants,  we  recently  had 
ground  breaking  on  significant  solar  projects  that  will  develop  92  megawatts  of  energy.  With  the 
addition  of  the  fourth  unit,  which  has  the  majority  of  the  infrastructure  to  support  it,  we  believe 
that  this  county,  and  this  country,  is  moving  in  the  right  direction  by  creating  alternative  energy 
projects,  and  removing  our  dependency  on  foreign  oil.  (0001-12-4  [Kugler,  John]) 

Comment:  New  wind  and  solar  power  would  definitely  play  a  role  in  our  energy  future.  But  the 
simple  nature  of  their  intermittency  requires  something  more.  (0001-13-14  [Salmon.  Edward])

NUREG-2168 


Appendix  D 


Comment:  Nuclear  is  clean,  it  produces  zero  carbon  emissions,  or  critical  air  pollutants.  In 
2009,  alone,  New  Jersey's  nuclear  power  plants  avoided  the  emission  of  142,000  tons  of  sulfur 
dioxide,  and  30  million,  trillion  metric  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  that  contribute  to  green 
house  gases,  smog,  and  acid  rain.  Nuclear  energy  accounts  for  73  percent  of  the  nation's 
emission-free,  electrical  generation.  And  it  needs  to  expand  this  role,  in  commitment  with  other 
renewable  sources,  to  meet  the  rising  energy  demand  in  an  environmentally  responsive 
manner.  (0001-13-6  [Salmon,  Edward]) 

Comment:  As  previously  stated,  we  believe  that  nuclear  power,  as  a  source  for  clean,  reliable, 
carbon  free  electrical  generation,  is  the  best  solution  to  the  nation's  current  and  future  energy 
needs.  And  it  poses  the  least  potential  threat  to  the  natural  environment,  when  compared  with 
other  generation  sources,  such  as  wind,  solar,  and  biomass.  (0001-6-2  [Lewis,  Kenneth]) 

Comment:  This  proposed  2,200  megawatt  nuclear  facility,  sited  on  350  acres,  operating  at  a 
slightly  conservative  capacity  of  90  percent,  will  produce  1 ,980  megawatts.  By  comparison,  to 
grow  enough  switch  grass  to  fire  boilers  for  electrical  generation,  equal  to  the  output  of  this 
proposed  facility,  assuming  a  middle  range  per  acre  harvest  of  switch  grass,  would  require 
3,700  square  miles.  That  area  required  in  this  particular  region,  makes  the  solution  really  not  of 
any  consideration,  because  it  represents  about  40  percent  of  the  state  area.  (0001-6-4  [Lewis, 
Kenneth]) 

Comment:  Another  alternative,  solar  cell  installations  on  open  land,  requires  large  areas,  and 
poses  a  significant  threat  to  the  flora  and  fauna  in  the  geographical  regions  in  which  they  are 
proposed.  For  example,  at  Nellis  Air  Force  Base  in  the  Nevada  desert,  one  megawatt  devices 
installations  on  9.3  acres  of  land,  with  solar  tracking  devices,  which  makes  them  highly  efficient. 
In  New  Jersey,  where  the  sun  is  less  intense,  a  275  square  mile  installation  would  be  required 
to  equal  the  electrical  output  of  the  proposed  reactor.  Solar  cells  installed  on  existing  structure 
may  not  pose  any,  as  yet,  recognized  threat  to  the  environment.  And  we  support  that  particular 
application.  (0001-6-5  [Lewis,  Kenneth]) 

Comment:  To  many  environmental  groups  renewable  energy  is  a  preferable  alternative  to 
nuclear  reactors.  To  those  concerned  with  the  conservation  of  biological  diversity,  however,  the 
cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  large  scale,  renewable  projects,  will  be  their  most  detrimental 
effect.  We  believe  that  concerns  for  the  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  the  alternatives,  wind, 
solar,  and  biomass,  should  be  included  in  the  final  EIS,  as  a  reason  for  rejecting  them  as  an 
alternative  to  nuclear  power.  (0001-6-6  [Lewis,  Kenneth]) 

Comment:  These  factors  are  major  part  of  the  reason  that  the  Maryland  Conservation  Council 
is  bucking  the  trend  of  most  of  the  major  environmental  groups,  in  our  enthusiastic  support  of 
nuclear  energy,  and  our  opposition  to  most  of  the  renewable  options,  particularly  wind. 
(0001-7-14  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Comment:  In  addition,  I  urge  that  the  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  alternative  energy 
generating  sources  be  included  in  the  Environmental  Impact  Statement,  in  order  to  show  that, 
by  comparison,  nuclear  energy  is  far  preferable,  is  a  far  preferable  option.  (0001-7-3  [Eastman,

Comment:  The  PSEG  site  application,  part  three,  environmental  reports,  contains  a  good 
analysis  of  the  renewable  options  compared  to  the  nuclear  option.  The  ESP  concludes  that 
wind  turbines,  solar  thermal  power,  and  photovoltaic  technologies,  due  to  the  intermittency  of 
wind  and  sun,  are  not  competitive  to  the  reliability  of  nuclear  power.  (0001-7-5  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Comment:  I'm  particularly  interested  in  addressing  the  biological  impacts  of  renewables, 
primarily  wind.  This  technology  has  had  a  huge  impact  on  the  biological  world.  In  order  to 
produce  an  equivalent  amount  of  energy,  wind  requires  an  enormous  footprint.  As  pointed  out, 
in  their  Environmental  Report,  quote,  to  replace  the  energy  equivalent  of  a  2,000  MWe  of 
nuclear  capacity,  operating  at  90  percent  capacity  factor,  approximately  3,300  two  MWes,  wind 
turbines,  operating  at  a  capacity  factor  of  30  percent,  would  be  required. 

These  turbines  would  be  sited  on  396,000  acres.  That  is  619  square  miles,  and  disturbs 
19,800,  or  31  acres,  or  31  square  miles,  to  accommodate  the  physical  footprint  of  the  towers 
themselves.  I  like  that  the  ESP's  comparison  of  that  amount  of  land,  I  like  the  comparison  to  1 5 
times  the  area  of  Norfolk,  that  is  a  lot  of  land.  (0001-7-6  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Comment:  Whether  the  area  is  on  land,  or  offshore,  it  is  mind  boggling  to  think  of  the  potential 
harm,  and  humongous  impacts  of  industrial  wind.  On  land,  particularly,  the  Appalachian 
Mountains  of  the  East,  the  396,000  acres,  required,  would  destroy  the  mainly  unfragmented, 
biologically  rich  forests,  which  are  not  only  habitat  for  bats  and  nesting  neo-tropical  birds,  but 
also  habitat  for  terrestrial  flora  and  fauna.  The  area  is,  also,  a  major  migratory  corridor  for  birds, 
bats,  and  raptors.  Yet  without  full  review  of  environmental  impacts,  or  cost  to  taxpayers  and 
customers,  permits  are  being  granted. 

As  for  the  impacts  offshore,  we  really  can't  know  the  full  extent  of  the  harm  turbines  will  have  on 
the  aquatic  resources,  benthic  organisms,  oceanic  mammals,  or  pelagic  birds.  Where  is  the 
precautionary  principle  in  the  blind  acceptance  of,  and  push  for,  such  a  destructive  form  of 
energy?  (0001-7-7  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Comment:  At  the  May  4th,  2010  public  meeting  that  NRC  held  on  the  project  I  commented  on 
the  importance  of  providing  additional  electrical  generating  capacity  to  meet  the  energy  needs  of 
New  Jersey  residents  and  businesses.  These  comments  are,  of  course,  still  applicable, 
especially  the  need  to  provide  base  load  generating  capacity,  supplemented  by  renewable 
energy  projects,  such  as  wind  and  solar,  in  New  Jersey.  (0001-8-4  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  I  also  mentioned  that  PSEG  new  nuclear  unit  will  provide  power  for  more  than 
3  million  homes  each  day,  as  opposed  to  fossil  fuel  power  plants,  and  there  will  be  no  green 
house  gas  emissions,  such  as  C02  or  methane,  as  was  mentioned  by  previous  speakers.  No 
S02  or  NOX  emissions  that  could  contribute  to  acid  rain,  or  nitrification  of  our  waterways.  And 
also  no  mercury  emissions  that  could  detrimentally  affect  aquatic  life  in  the  Delaware  River  and 
Bay.  (0001-8-5  [Molzahn,  Robert])

maintain  nuclear  energy's  current  20  percent  contribution,  we  must  build  about  one  new  reactor 
per  year  starting  in  2016.  New  wind  and  solar  power  will  definitely  play  a  part  in  our  energy 
future,  but  the  simple  nature  of  their  intermittency  requires  something  more.  The  New  Jersey 
Energy  Coalition  supports  the  development  of  a  new  nuclear  facility  here  in  Salem  County  as  it 
will  help  mitigate  rising  energy  demand  with  a  clean  power  source  that  fuels  job  growth  and 
strengthens  our  economy.  (0004-5  [Salmon,  Edward]) 

Comment:  In  evaluating  environmental  issues  relative  to  this  nuclear  power  facility  and 
alternative  energy  sources  that  might  be  proposed  to  negate  its  necessity  biomass  is  listed  as  a 
consideration.  This  proposed  2200  Megawatt  (MW)  nuclear  facility  sited  on  350  acres  operating 
at  a  slightly  conservative  capacity  factor  of  90%  will  produce  1980  MW.  By  comparison  to  grow 
enough  switch  grass  to  fire  boilers  for  electrical  generation  equal  to  the  output  of  the  nuclear 
facility  (assuming  a  middle  of  the  range  yield  of  2.5  metric  tons  per  acre  per  year  would  require 
planting  3700  square  miles.  The  area  required  in  this  region  makes  this  solution  impractical 
because  it  represents  about  40%  of  the  area  of  the  state.  (0007-3  [Lewis,  Kenneth]) 

Comment:  Another  alternative,  solar  cell  installations  on  open  land,  requires  large  areas  and 
pose  a  significant  threat  to  the  flora  and  fauna  in  the  geographical  regions  in  which  they  are 
proposed.  For  example,  at  Nellis  Air  Force  Base  in  the  Nevada  desert  1  MW  of  NAMEPLATE 
capacity  is  installed  on  9.3  acres  of  land  and  these  are  sophisticated  devices  that  track  the  sun. 
In  New  Jersey  where  the  sun  is  less  intense  a  275  square  mile  installation  would  be  required  to 
equal  the  electrical  output  of  the  proposed  reactor.  Solar  cells  installed  on  existing  structure 
may  not  pose  any  as  yet  recognized  threat  to  the  environment  and  we  support  them.  (0007-4

Comment:  There  are  two  key  sections  in  every  EIS:  The  first  is  an  analysis  of  the  cumulative 
impacts  of  the  proposed  action,  and  the  second  is  an  analysis  of  alternatives  to  the  proposed 
action.  Thus,  the  dEIS  states:  Cumulative  impacts  result  when  the  effects  of  an  action  are 
added  to  or  interact  with  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  effects  on  the 
same  resources.  And  further:  These  combined  impacts  ...  include  individually  minor  but 
collectively  potentially  significant  actions  taking  place  over  a  period  of  time.  To  many 
environmental  groups  renewable  energy  is  a  preferable  alternative  to  reactors.  To  those 
concerned  with  the  conservation  of  biological  diversity,  however,  the  cumulative  ecological 
impacts  of  large-scale  renewable  projects  will  be  their  most  detrimental  effect.  We  believe  that 
concern  for  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  the  Alternatives,  wind,  solar,  and  biomass  should 
be  included  in  the  final  EIS  as  a  reason  for  rejecting  them  as  an  alternative.  (0007-5  [Lewis, 
Kenneth]) 

Comment:  Salem  County  is  now  recognized  as  the  alternative  energy  capital  of  the  Northeast. 
Not  only  are  we  fortunate  enough  to  have  three  operating  nuclear  power  plants  we  recently  had 
ground  breakings  on  significant  solar  projects  that  will  develop  92  megawatts  of  energy.  With 
the  addition  of  a  fourth  unit,  which  has  the  majority  of  the  infrastructure  to  support  it,  we  believe 
this  country  is  moving  in  the  correct  direction  by  creating  alternative  energy  projects  and 
removing  our  dependency  on  foreign  oil.  (0009-5  [Kugler,  John]) 

Comment:  At  the  May  4,  2010  public  meeting  that  the  NRC  held  on  this  project  I  commented 
on  the  importance  of  providing  additional  electrical  generation  capacity  to  meet  the  energy

needs  of  New  Jersey  residents  and  businesses.  Those  comments  are  still  applicable  especially 
the  need  to  provide  base  load  generating  capacity  supplemented  by  renewable  energy  projects 
such  as  wind  and  solar  in  New  Jersey.  (0011-3  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  I  also  mentioned  that  PSEG's  new  nuclear  unit  will  provide  power  for  more  than 
three  million  homes  each  day  and,  as  compared  to  fossil  fuel  power  plants,  there  will  be  no 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  such  as  C02  or  methane.  There  will  also  be  no  S02  or  NOx 
emissions  that  would  contribute  to  acid  rain  or  nitrification  of  our  waterways.  There  will  also  be 
no  mercury  emissions  that  could  detrimentally  affect  aquatic  life  in  the  Delaware  River  and  Bay. 
(0011-5  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  Whether  that  area  is  on  land  or  offshore,  it  is  mind  boggling  to  think  of  potential 
harm  and  humongous  impacts  of  industrial  wind.  On  land,  particularly  in  the  Appalachian 
mountains  of  the  east,  the  396,000  acres  required  would  destroy  the  mainly  unfragmented, 
biologically  rich  forests  which  are  not  only  habitat  for  bats  and  nesting  neo-tropical  birds,  but 
also  habitat  for  terrestrial  flora  and  fauna.  The  area  is  also  a  major  migratory  corridor  for  birds, 
bats,  and  raptors.  Yet  without  full  review  of  the  environmental  impacts  or  the  costs  to  taxpayers 
and  customers,  permits  are  being  granted.  As  for  impacts  offshore,  we  really  can't  know  the  full 
extent  of  the  harm  turbines  will  have  on  aquatic  resources,  benthic  organisms,  oceaneantic 
mammals,  or  pelagic  birds.  Where  is  the  precautionary  principle  in  the  blind  acceptance  of  and 
push  for  such  a  destructive  form  of  energy?  (0012-10  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Comment:  In  addition,  I  urge  that  the  cumulative  ecological  impacts  of  alternative  energy 
generating  sources  be  included  in  the  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (EIS)  in  order  to  show 
that  by  comparison  nuclear  energy  is  a  far  preferable  option.  (0012-3  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Comment:  The  PSEG  Site  ESP  application,  Part  3,  environmental  reports  contains  a  good 
analysis  of  the  renewable  options  compared  to  the  nuclear  option.  The  ESP  concludes  that  the 
wind  turbines,  solar  thermal  power,  and  photovoltaic  technologies,  due  to  the  intermittency  of 
the  wind  and  sun  are  not  competitive  to  the  reliability  of  nuclear  power.  (0012-6  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Comment:  I  am  particularly  interested  in  addressing  the  biological  impacts  of  renewables, 
primarily  wind.  This  technology  has  a  huge  impact  on  the  biological  world.  In  order  to  produce 
an  equivalent  amount  energy,  wind  requires  an  enormous  footprint.  As  pointed  out  in  their 
Environmental  Report,  ...  to  replace  the  energy  equivalent  a  2200  MWe  of  nuclear  capacity 
operating  at  90  percent  capacity  factor,  approximately  3300  2  MWe  wind  turbines  operating  at  a 
capacity  factor  of  30  percent  would  be  required.  These  turbines  would  be  sited  on 
396,000  acres  (619  square  miles)  and  disturb  19,800  acres  (31  square  miles)  to  accommodate 
the  physical  footprint  of  the  towers  themselves.  (I  like  the  ESP's  comparison  of  that  amount  of 
land  to  15  times  the  area  of  Newark!)  (0012-7  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Response:  Alternate  energy  sources,  including  fossil  fuels  and  renewable  sources  of  energy 
(such  as  wind,  solar,  and  biomass),  will  be  evaluated  and  discussed  in  Chapter  9  of  the  EIS  in 
comparison  to  a  nuclear  plant.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  these  alternate  energy 
sources  will  also  be  addressed  in  Chapter  9.

Comment:  So  we  want  to  educate,  and  stress  the  need  for  a  broad  energy  platform,  that 
includes  conservation,  green  job  initiatives,  energy  efficiency,  supply  diversity,  transmission 
upgrade,  clean  baseload  generation,  and  healthy,  smart,  economically  viable,  renewable  energy 
projects.  (0001-13-1  [Salmon,  Edward]) 

Comment:  Alternative  sources  are  important,  and  we  support  them.  But  they  only  can  take  us 
so  far.  Wind  and  solar  are  intermittent,  and  lack  the  sheer  capacity  of  baseload  plants. 
Conservation  efforts,  energy  efficiency  enhancements,  and  a  diverse  mix  of  energy  sources  will 
serve  us  best.  However,  we  should  promote  an  increase  in  the  use  of  nuclear  energy,  as  an 
environmentally  clean  and  reliable  solution.  (0001-13-7  [Salmon,  Edward]) 

Comment:  And  my  final  point  is  that  I'm  very  familiar  with  the  efforts  to  pursue  renewable 
energy  off  the  coast  of  New  Jersey,  including  wind,  wave,  and  tidal  energy.  These  are  in  the 
nascent  stages  of  development.  But  if  you  look  at  the  projected  production,  energy  production 
from  these  sources,  it  certainly  will  not  meet  the  future  demand  for  our  state,  which  continues  to 
grow,  as  we  continue  to  develop.  (0002-4-7  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Comment:  Most  of  the  Academy's  programs  have  a  component  in  them  that  focuses  on  global 
climate  change.  And  we  feel  that  that  is  an  extremely  important  thing  for  people  to  be  exposed 
to,  to  learn  about,  and  especially  the  kids  that  we  deal  with,  in  education  programs.  There  is  no 
question  that  conservation  measures,  in  terms  of  electrical  usage,  is  an  important  part  of 
combating  that  trend,  as  well  as  developing  increased  access  to  renewable  sources  of  energy. 
But  there  is  nuclear  technology,  which  has  been  around  for  a  long  time,  and  has  successfully 
been  applied  to  providing  baseload  for  the  state  of  New  Jersey,  and  the  country  as  a  whole,  it  is 
a  proven  technology,  and  is  one  that  is  carbon  free.  (0002-5-3  [Duvall,  Brian]) 

Comment:  The  goal  is  to  make  electricity.  But  I  feel  that  PSEG  is  going  to  be  spending  tens  of 
billions  of  dollars  on  this  nuclear  plant.  I  think  they  would  be  better  invested  to  invest  in  solar 
and  wind  farms,  which  could  be  built  in  the  matter  of  a  year,  one  year;  you  could  have  a  farm 
built.  With  this  new  plant  it  will  take,  probably,  ten  years  to  build.  You  could  be  generating 
electricity  immediately.  I  think  it  is  a  better  investment.  (0002-6-2  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Comment:  As  a  young  engineer,  in  the  nuclear  industry,  one  of  the  most  exciting  aspects  of 
my  future  career,  is  the  possibility  of  new  nuclear.  And  while  wind,  solar,  and  other  carbon-free 
forms  of  energy  are  important,  and  definitely  needed,  to  provide  for  the  energy  demand  that  we 
have  now  and  in  the  future,  new  nuclear  must  be  a  part  of  that  equation.  (0002-7-1  [Nedd, 
Sheranee]) 

Comment:  The  key  thing  I  think,  when  I  take  a  look  at  the  energy  question  that  we  have  in  the 
United  States,  has  to  do  with  coal  generation,  and  the  fact  that  fewer  and  fewer  coal  generated 
facilities  are  going  to  be  used  in  our  future.  Whether  Cap  and  Trade  passes  or  not,  coal 
generation  is  on  the  way  out.  And  what  is  going  to  replace  it?  At  Mannington  Mills  we  have 
solar  generation,  and  I'm  very  proud  of  what  we  have  been  able  to  do  with  that.  But,  quite 
frankly,  that  solar  generation  would  not  be  economical  unless  the  federal  government  had  heavy 
tax  subsidies,  in  order  to  make  it  happen.  The  same  thing  has  to  do  with  wind.  And  while  I 
think  the  solar  and  wind  generation  title,  etcetera,  is  wonderful,  sustainable  and  good,  we  have 
to  have  large  generation  of  fossil  free,  in  order  for  us  to  be  able  to  get  environmental  goal  posts

that  we  would  like  to  hit  as  a  society.  And,  obviously,  I'm  here  tonight  saying  I  think  nuclear  is  a 
very,  very  good  alternative.  And  I  have  a  high  degree  of  confidence  in  the  fact  that  PSEG  can 
deliver.  (0002-8-3  [Campbell,  Keith]) 

Comment:  Nuclear  generation  is  clean.  It  produces  zero  carbon  emissions  or  criteria  air 
pollutants.  In  2009  alone,  New  Jersey's  nuclear  power  plants  avoided  the  emission  of  one 
hundred  and  forty-two  thousand  tons  of  sulfur  dioxide  and  30  million  metric  tons  of  carbon 
dioxide,  emissions  that  commonly  contribute  to  greenhouse  gases,  smog  and  acid  rain.  Nuclear 
energy  accounts  for  73  percent  of  the  nation's  emission-free  electrical  generation,  and  it  needs 
to  expand  this  role  in  compliment  with  other  renewable  sources  to  meet  rising  energy  demand  in 
an  environmentally  responsible  matter.  Alternative  sources  are  important,  but  can  only  take  us 
so  far  -wind  and  solar  are  intermittent  and  lack  the  sheer  capacity  of  base  load  plants.  (0004-1 
[Salmon,  Edward]) 

Comment:  Conservation  efforts,  energy  efficiency  enhancements  and  a  diverse  mix  of  energy 
sources  will  serve  us  best.  However,  we  should  promote  an  increase  in  the  use  of  nuclear 
energy  as  an  environmentally  clean  and  reliable  solution.  New  Jersey  needs  to  better 
acknowledge  and  take  advantage  of  the  proven  technology  capable  of  providing  carbon-free 
base  load  electricity.  The  development  of  new  nuclear  generating  facilities  is  essential  if  we  are 
going  to  address  climate  change,  meet  demand  increases  in  a  meaningful  way,  and  promote 
energy  independence  from  the  Middle  East.  Changes  in  federal  air  regulations,  the  age  of 
existing  facilities  and  an  improving  economy  all  signal  the  need  for  new  clean  base  load  power 
supplies.  (0004-2  [Salmon,  Edward]) 

Comment:  While  I  am  not  an  expert  in  energy  generation,  there  is  no  question  that  the  future 
welfare  of  human  society  depends  on  reducing  energy  use  and  developing  zero  carbon  sources 
of  energy.  Many  experts  have  indicated  that  nuclear  power  represents  a  viable  alternative  in 
the  short  term  and  must  be  part  of  any  mix  of  conservation  and  new  energy  sources  that  are 
used  to  make  the  transition  to  a  zero  carbon  future.  (0014-15,  0001-4-10,  0014-18  [Velinsky, 

David]) 

Response:  The  NRC  is  not  involved  in  establishing  energy  policy:  rather,  it  regulates  nuclear 
energy  to  protect  public  health  and  safety  within  existing  policy.  An  assessment  of  a  broad 
energy  platform  that  includes  such  items  as  conservation  and  energy  efficiency  and/or  alternate 
sources  of  energy  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  EIS.  Nevertheless,  Chapter  9  of  the  EIS  will 
describe  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  alternative  energy  sources,  including  fossil  fuels 
and  renewable  sources  of  energy,  in  comparison  to  nuclear  power. 

Comment:  Another  factor  to  consider,  in  comparing  nuclear  power  to  wind,  is  the  life 
expectancy  of  the  turbines.  Many  of  the  nuclear  reactors,  in  the  United  States,  are  over 
40  years  old,  and  are  still  producing  energy  at  90  percent  capacity.  Whereas  the  thousands  of 
turbines,  being  proposed,  or  already  built,  have  a  life  expectancy  of  only  25  years,  at  a 
30  percent  capacity  factor.  (0001-7-10  [Eastman,  Ajax])

[Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Response:  A  detailed  assessment  of  the  engineering  details  of  alternate  power  production 
( such  as  those  associated  with  wind  turbines)  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  environmental  review 
and  will  thus  not  be  addressed  in  the  EIS.  Nevertheless,  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of 
alternatives,  such  as  wind  energy,  will  be  addressed  in  Chapter  9  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Whether  the  area  is  on  land,  or  offshore,  it  is  mind  boggling  to  think  of  the  potential 
harm,  and  humongous  impacts  of  industrial  wind.  On  land,  particularly,  the  Appalachian

energy?  (0001-7-8  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Response:  Impacts  of  alternative  energy  sources  such  as  industrial  and  wind  will  be  discussed 
in  Chapter  9.0 

Comment:  As  for  impacts  offshore,  we  really  can't  know  the  full  extent  of  the  harm  turbines  will 
have  on  aquatic  resources,  benthic  organisms,  oceaneantic  mammals,  or  pelagic  birds. 

(0012-11  [Eastman,  Ajax]) 

Response:  Alternative  energy  sources  and  their  potential  impacts  to  aquatic  resources  will  be 
discussed  in  Chapter  9. 

D.2.29  Comments  Concerning  Alternatives — System  Design 

Comment:  The  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  and  PSEG  must  consider  an  alternative  to  the  land 
swap,  such  as  using  the  existing  road  to  Artificial  Island,  instead  of  creating  a  second  road  if, 
and  when,  a  nuclear  facility  is  permitted.  In  our  view  the  existing  access  road  should  be 
sufficient.  Issues  associated  with  new  spoil  disposal  site  are,  as  yet,  unknown,  as  the  sites 
under  consideration  are  unknown.  But  there  are  likely  to  be  issues,  considering  the  Army  Corps 
of  Engineers  for  riverfront  lands.  (0001-19-7  [Blake,  Matt]) 

Comment:  The  Army  Corps  and  PSEG  must  consider  an  alternative  to  the  land  swap,  such  as 
using  the  existing  access  road  to  Artificial  Island  instead  of  creating  a  second  road,  if  and  when 
a  new  nuclear  facility  is  permitted.  This  would  avoid  destruction  of  wetlands  and  obviate  the 
need  for  a  new  dredge  disposal  site.  In  our  view,  the  existing  access  road  should  be  sufficient 
and  no  additional  destruction  of  wetlands  should  be  permitted  at  the  site.  Issues  associated

with  a  new  spoil  disposal  site  are  as  yet  unknown  as  the  sites  under  consideration  are  unknown. 
But  there  are  likely  to  be  issues,  considering  the  Anny  Corps'  preference  for  riverfront  lands. 
(0003-6  [Batty,  Sandy]  [Dillingham,  Tim]  [Galetto,  Jane  Morton]  [Goldsmith,  Amy]  [McNutt,  Richard] 
[Nolan,  Christine]  [O'Gorman,  Margaret]  [Schulte,  James]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  EIS  should  require  clearer  evaluation  of  PSEG's  use  of  the  Army  Corps 
confined  disposal  facility,  the  agreement  to  do  so,  and  any  cumulative  impacts  resulting  from 
use  of  the  site.  According  to  the  ER  4.1-9,  there  will  be  construction  laydown  and  related 
activities  located  in  the  Corps  CDF  site.  It  is  unclear  what  long-term  or  permanent  impacts  may 
result,  despite  the  site  use  for  temporary  activity.  The  NRC  should  consider  these  potential 
impacts  and  the  full  range  of  alternatives  in  its  EIS.  Moreover,  the  EIS  should  consider  the 
chain  reaction  of  environmental  impacts  if  the  CDF  is  used  for  another  purpose.  The  NRC 
should  also  examine  the  mechanism  by  which  the  Army  Corps  is  providing  the  use  of  this  land 
and  any  impacts  this  may  have  on  Army  Corps  permit  reviews  or  regulatory  processes  for  the 
Project.  (0018-8  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  In  regard  to  the  "land  swap"  mentioned  in  the  comments,  Chapters  4  and  5  of  the 
EIS  will  address  the  proposed  use  of  the  Corps'  existing  Containment  Disposal  Facility  (CDF)  at 
the  north  end  of  Artificial  Island,  as  well  as  the  proposed  exchange  of  property  between  PSFG 
and  the  Corps  to  provide  a  functional  replacement  for  the  existing  CDF.  The  potential 
environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  new  access  road  to  the  PS  EG  Site  will  be  addressed  in 
Chapter  4  of  the  FIS. 

Comment:  In  reviewing  the  PSEG  Early  Site  Permit  application,  and  Environmental  Report 
filed  on  May  25th,  2010,  we  noted  that  the  new  units  intake  and  cooling  systems  will  be 
designed  to  minimize  the  impact  to  the  aquatic  community,  by  utilizing  cooling  towers,  and  an 
intake  system  and  design  flows  that  conform  to  best  available  technology  as  required  under 
Section  31 6B  of  the  Clean  Water  Act.  The  cooling  tower  blow-down  discharge  should  have  little 
impact  on  the  Delaware  River,  at  this  location,  or  significantly  elevate  river  water  temperatures. 
(0001-8-6  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  A  new  plant  will  provide  an  excellent  opportunity  to  incorporate  new  technology, 
hopefully  to  produce  cleaner,  safer  energy,  and  especially  if  a  cooling  tower  is  incorporated  into 
the  new  plans.  I'm  familiar  with  the  impingement  and  entrainment,  as  I  said.  The  much  reduced 
need  for  water  in  a  cooling  tower  process,  you  know,  will  reduce  much  of  that  impact, 
considerably.  I  know  of  no  scientific  study  that  proves  that  the  present  cooling  processes,  at 
Salem  and  Hope  Creek  has  generated  any  impact  on  the  estuary.  It  can  be  debated,  it  can  be 
argued.  But  I  have  not  seen  a  scientific  study  that  really  proves  that  fact.  After  reviewing  the 
EPS  request,  I  find  no  reason  to  deny  the  requested  permit.  (0001-9-4  [Lacandro,  Roger]) 

Comment:  A  new  plant  will  provide  an  excellent  opportunity  to  incorporate  new  technology, 
hopefully,  to  produce  cleaner,  safer  energy  especially  if  a  cooling  tower  is  incorporated  to 
significantly  reduce  bay  water  usage,  impingement  and  entrainment  of  aquatic  biota  and  the 
impact  of  large  quantities  of  elevated  temperature  water  reentering  the  estuary.  (0008-5

Comment:  In  reviewing  the  PSEG  ESP  Application  and  Environmental  Report  filed  on  May  25, 
2010,  we  noted  that  the  new  units  intake  and  cooling  systems  will  be  designed  to  minimize  the 
impact  to  the  aquatic  community  by  utilizing  cooling  towers  and  an  intake  system  and  design 
flows  that  conform  to  Best  Available  Technology  as  required  by  Section  316(b)  of  the  Clean 
Water  Act.  The  cooling  tower  blowdown  discharge  should  have  little  effect  on  the  Delaware 
River  at  this  location  or  significantly  elevate  river  water  temperatures.  (0011-8  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  In  addition  to  the  steps  being  taken  to  protect  the  wetlands  impacted  by 
construction,  the  aquatic  impacts  of  the  proposed  facility  will  be  limited  by  the  use  of  a  closed 
cycle  cooling  system.  Compared  to  a  once-through  system,  these  cooling  towers  will  divert 
much  less  water  for  cooling.  Projected  maximum  diversion  for  the  new  facility  is  less  than  4%  of 
the  current  amount  used  by  the  Salem  Generating  Station  and  is  a  very  small  fraction  the  total 
volume  of  the  Delaware  River  flow.  As  a  result,  impingement  of  fish  populations  will  be  a  small 
fraction--less  than  3%  of  the  current  level  of  the  Salem  station. 

Because  of  the  closed  cooling  system,  we  would  also  expect  the  thermal  plume  of  the  new  plant 
to  be  localized  and  relatively  small,  with  no  significant  impact  on  the  local  aquatic  biota.  The 
conclusion  is  based  on  past  studies  of  the  impact  of  thermal  plumes  from  the  existing  PSEG 
generating  plants,  the  expected  operation  of  the  proposed  cooling  structures,  and  our 
understanding  of  the  ecology  of  aquatic  species  in  the  vicinity  of  the  plant.  (0014-17  [Velinsky, 
David]) 

Response:  No  specific  nuclear  reactor  or  reactor  design  has  yet  been  proposed  for  the  PSEG 
Site:  rather,  the  ESP  application  is  merely  seeking  approval  from  the  NRC  to  bank  the  PSEG 
Site  for  possible  future  use.  Subsequent  approvals  would  be  needed  from  the  NRC  prior  to  the 
construction  and  operation  of  any  nuclear  reactor  unit(s)  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Nevertheless, 
Chapter  3  of  the  EIS  will  describe  the  plant  parameter  envelope  on  which  the  assessment  of 
potential  environmental  impacts  will  be  based.  The  hypothetical  design  of  any  water  intake 
systems  and/or  cooling  towers  will  be  developed  by  PSEG  and  offered  to  the  NRC  for  review  as 
part  of  the  assessment  in  the  EIS.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  such  facilities  will  be 
addressed  in  Chapter  4  and  5  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Finally,  NRC  must  evaluate  the  impacts  and  all  viable  alternatives  for  cooling.  DRN 
notes  that  EPA's  Phase  I  regulations  for  new  sources  require  closed-cycle  cooling,  which  the 
new  plant  will  have.  68  Fed.  Reg.  36749-36755  (June  19,  2003).  DRN  has  long  advocated  for 
closed-cycle  cooling  at  the  existing  Salem  facility.  However,  that  does  not  mean  that  closed- 
cycle  cooling  is  without  impacts,  or  that  one  size  fits  all  when  selecting  the  specific  cooling 
technology.  According  to  the  ER  "Compared  with  a  once-  through  cooling  system,  a  closed 
cycle  cooling  system  substantially  reduces  the  volume  of  water  diverted  for  cooling  but 
increases  consumptive  water  use  as  a  result  of  evaporation  loss  in  the  cooling  tower.”  (0018-14 
[Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Comment:  The  ER  notes  that  PSEG  is  evaluating  three  different  closed-loop  designs  for  the 
cooling  water  system  of  the  new  plant:  mechanical  draft,  natural  draft,  and  fan-  assisted  natural 
draft.  However,  only  the  mechanical  and  natural  draft  designs  were  evaluated  in  the  ER.  The 
EIS  must  evaluate  all  alternatives,  including  any  not  evaluated  in  the  ER,  to  ensure  that  all 
environmental  impacts  are  adequately  assessed.  (0018-18  [Brown,  Elizabeth])

Appendix  D 


Comment:  Therefore,  DRN  urges  NRC  to  review  certain  issues  in  more  detail,  including: 
clearer  evaluation  of  PSEG's  use  of  the  Army  Corps  confined  disposal  facility,  and  cumulative 
impacts  resulting  from  use  of  that  site;  water  impacts  including  dredging  and  construction 
impacts;  filling  of  wetlands;  floodplain  impacts;  habitat  impacts  and  impacts  to  species, 
especially  Atlantic  sturgeon;  and  impacts  and  evaluation  of  alternatives  for  cooling  systems. 
(0018-5  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  The  impacts  of  viable  alternatives  for  the  cooling  system  will  be  addressed  in 
Chapter  9  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Clearly,  the  EIS  will  need  to  address  the  impact  of  dredging  and  related  shoreline 
disturbance  and  take  all  viable  alternatives  into  account.  (0018-10  [Brown,  Elizabeth]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  of  construction  activities  such  as  dredging  and  shoreline 
disturbances  will  be  evaluated  in  Section  4.3.2  of  the  EIS.  In  addition,  alternative  technologies 
will  be  discussed  in  Chapter  9. 

Comment:  And  if  you  want  to  create  jobs  in  this  state,  here,  the  way  to  do  it  is  build  solar 
farms,  build  wind  farms.  Build  two  new  cooling  towers  at  Salem  I  and  II.  They  will  create 
hundreds  of  construction  jobs.  And,  also,  you  will  create  fishing  jobs,  which  add  up  to 
thousands  and  thousands  of  jobs.  That  should  be  the  approach,  also,  that  should  be 
considered  in  the  overall  discussion  of  this  issue.  (0002-6-15  [Schneider,  Richard]) 

Response:  The  NRC  is  not  involved  in  establishing  employment  programs  or  policy  nor  in 
promoting  employment  opportunities  within  any  state;  rather,  it  regulates  nuclear  energy  to 
protect  public  health  and  safety  within  existing  policy.  The  alternatives  described  in  the 
comment  are  beyond  the  scope  of  the  review  being  conducted  by  the  NRC  for  this  Early  Site 
Permit  application;  hence,  they  will  not  be  addressed  in  the  EIS. 

D.2.31  Comments  Concerning  Benefit-Cost  Balance 

Comment:  With  rising  energy  costs  a  concern  for  every  American,  nuclear  power  plants  are 
the  lowest  cost  producer  of  baseload  electricity,  especially  in  a  region  that  is  densely  populated, 
and  whose  industry  drives  demand,  nuclear  generation's  low  cost,  and  reliability,  fosters  a 
competitive  energy  market,  and  keeps  electric  costs  down  for  the  ratepayer.  (0001-13-11 
[Salmon,  Edward]) 

Comment:  Other  benefits  to  building  this  new  unit  that  would  have  a  positive  impact  regionally 
are  the  boost  to  the  local  economy  with  the  purchase  of  commodities  such  as: 

400,000  cubic  feet  of  concrete 
66,000  tons  of  steel 
44  miles  of  piping 
300  miles  of  electrical  wiring 

130,000  electrical  components  (0009-8  [Kugler,  John]) 


November  2015 


D-107 


NUREG-2168 


Appendix  D 


Comment:  And,  lastly,  we  are  all  ratepayers.  And  what  does  a  ratepayer  want?  The  ratepayer 
wants  to  pay  a  lower  energy  cost.  And  with  the  added  value  of  a  fourth  nuclear  power  plant  we 
will  all  get  that.  So  with  that  we  support  this  plan  one  hundred  percent,  and  I  thank  you  very 
much.  (0001-22-6  [Kehoe,  Jim]) 

Comment:  Nuclear  energy  is  also  affordable  and  reliable.  With  rising  energy  costs  a  concern 
for  every  American,  nuclear  power  plants  are  the  lowest-cost  producer  of  base  load  electricity. 
Especially  in  a  region  that  is  densely  populated  and  whose  industry  drives  demand,  nuclear 
generation's  low  cost  and  reliability  fosters  a  competitive  energy  market  and  keeps  electric  costs 
down  for  the  ratepayer.  (0004-3  [Salmon,  Edward]) 

Response:  The  comments  note  the  general  attributes  of  nuclear  power  that  makes  it  attractive 
as  a  power  source.  This  comment  will  not  be  discussed  specifically,  but  a  balance  of  the 
benefits  and  costs  associated  with  the  proposed  power  plant  will  be  contained  in  Chapter  10  of 
the  EIS.

APPENDIX  E 


DRAFT  ENVIRONMENTAL  IMPACT  STATEMENT 
COMMENTS  AND  RESPONSES 


As  part  of  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  review  of  the  PSEG  Power,  LLC, 
and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  application  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  at  the  PSEG  Site 
in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  the  NRC  and  the  U.S.  Army 
Corps  of  Engineers  (Corps  or  USACE)  (together  referred  to  as  the  “review  team”)  solicited 
comments  from  the  public  on  the  draft  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS),  which  was 
issued  in  August  2014.  A  75-day  comment  period  began  on  August  22,  2014,  when  the 
U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  issued  a  Federal  Register  Notice  (79  FR  49774) 
on  the  filing  of  the  draft  EIS  to  allow  members  of  the  public  to  comment  on  the  results  of  the 
environmental  review.  The  comment  period  was  subsequently  extended  by  an  additional 
30  days  and  therefore  ended  on  December  6,  2014. 

As  part  of  the  process  to  solicit  public  comments  on  the  draft  EIS,  the  review  team: 

•  placed  a  copy  of  the  draft  EIS  at  the  Salem  Free  Public  Library  in  Salem,  New  Jersey; 

•  made  the  draft  EIS  available  in  the  NRC’s  Public  Document  Room  in  Rockville,  Maryland; 

•  placed  an  electronic  copy  of  the  draft  EIS  on  the  NRC  website  at 
www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr2168/; 

•  provided  a  copy  of  the  draft  EIS  to  any  member  of  the  public  who  requested  one; 

•  sent  copies  of  the  draft  EIS  to  certain  Federal,  State,  Tribal,  and  local  agencies; 

•  published  a  notice  of  availability  of  the  draft  EIS  in  the  Federal  Register  on  August  22,  2014 
(79  FR  49820-22); 

•  filed  the  draft  EIS  with  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA); 

•  held  two  public  meetings  on  October  1,  2014,  in  Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey;  and 

•  held  two  public  meetings  on  October  23,  2014,  in  Middletown,  Delaware. 

In  addition,  as  part  of  the  process  to  solicit  public  comments  on  the  draft  EIS,  USACE 
Philadelphia  District  issued  public  notice  CENAP-OP-R-2009-0157  dated  September  4,  2014. 

A  combined  total  of  approximately  75  people  attended  the  two  public  meetings  in  New  Jersey, 
and  another  140  people  attended  the  two  public  meetings  in  Delaware.  Several  attendees  at 
each  meeting  provided  oral  comments,  and  a  certified  court  reporter  recorded  these  oral 
comments  and  prepared  written  transcripts  of  each  meeting.  The  transcripts  of  the  public 
meetings  were  published  in  October  2014  (see  Agencywide  Documents  Access  and 
Management  System  [ADAMS]  Accession  Number  ML14310A384  for  the  transcript  of  the 
October  1  afternoon  meeting  and  Accession  Number  ML14310A433  for  the  October  1  evening 
meeting)  and  November  2014  (see  Accession  Number  ML14310A438  for  the  transcript  of  the

Appendix  E 


October  23  afternoon  meeting  and  Accession  Number  ML14310A444  for  the  October  23 
evening  meeting).  In  addition  to  the  comments  received  at  the  public  meetings,  the  NRC 
received  45  letters  and  e-mail  messages  containing  comments. 

The  comment  letters,  e-mail  messages,  and  transcripts  of  the  public  meetings  are  available 
in  ADAMS,  which  is  accessible  at  http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm.html.  Persons  who  do  not 
have  access  to  ADAMS  or  who  encounter  problems  in  accessing  the  documents  located  in 
ADAMS  should  contact  the  NRC’s  Public  Document  Room  reference  staff  at  1-800-397-4209 
or  301-415-4737.  ADAMS  accession  numbers  for  the  letters  and  e-mail  messages  are  provided 
in  Table  E-1. 

E.1  Disposition  of  Comments 

Each  set  of  comments  from  a  given  commenter  was  assigned  a  unique  correspondence 
identifier,  allowing  each  set  of  comments  from  a  commenter  to  be  traced  back  to  the  transcript, 
letter,  or  e-mail  in  which  the  comments  were  submitted.  After  the  comment  period  concluded, 
the  review  team  considered  and  dispositioned  all  comments  received.  To  identify  each 
individual  comment,  the  team  reviewed  the  transcripts  of  the  public  meetings  and  each  piece  of 
correspondence  related  to  the  draft  EIS.  As  part  of  the  review,  the  review  team  identified 
statements  that  it  believed  were  related  to  the  proposed  action  and  recorded  the  statements  as 
comments.  Each  comment  was  assigned  to  a  specific  subject  area,  and  similar  comments  were 
grouped  together.  Finally,  responses  were  prepared  for  each  comment  or  group  of  comments. 

Some  comments  addressed  topics  and  issues  that  are  not  part  of  the  environmental  review  for 
this  proposed  action.  These  comments  included  questions  about  NRC’s  safety  review,  general 
statements  of  support  or  opposition  to  nuclear  power,  and  comments  on  the  NRC  regulatory 
process  in  general.  These  comments  are  included,  but  detailed  responses  are  not  provided 
because  the  comments  address  issues  not  directly  related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  this 
proposed  action  and  are,  thus,  outside  the  scope  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of 
1 969,  as  amended  (NEPA)  review  of  this  proposed  action.  If  appropriate,  these  comments  were 
forwarded  to  the  appropriate  organization  within  the  NRC  for  consideration.  Many  comments, 
however,  specifically  addressed  the  scope  of  the  environmental  review,  analyses,  and  issues 
contained  in  the  draft  EIS.  Examples  include  comments  about  potential  impacts,  proposed 
mitigation,  the  agency  review  process,  and  the  public  comment  period.  Detailed  responses  to 
each  of  these  comments  are  provided  in  this  appendix.  When  the  comments  resulted  in  a 
change  in  the  text  of  the  draft  EIS,  the  corresponding  response  refers  the  reader  to  the 
appropriate  section  of  the  EIS  where  the  change  was  made.  Throughout  the  final  EIS,  with  the 
exception  of  this  new  Appendix  E,  revisions  to  the  text  from  the  draft  EIS  are  indicated  by 
vertical  lines  (change  bars)  in  the  margin  beside  the  text. 

Table  E-1  provides  a  list  of  commenters  identified  by  name,  affiliation  (if  given),  comment 
number,  and  the  source  of  the  comment. 

Table  E-2  provides  an  alphabetical  index  to  the  comment  categories  and  lists  the  commenters 
and  the  specific  comment  identification  number(s)  that  were  included  in  each  category.

E.2.1  Comments  Concerning  the  ESP  Process 

Comment:  I'm  still  kind  of  confused  about  how  the  NRC  can  do  a  thorough  Draft  Environmental 
Impact  Statement,  and  Final  Environmental  Impact  Statement,  without  knowing  the  number, 
size,  or  kind  of  reactors  planned.  I  know  that  this  is  just  an  Early  Site  Permit,  and  that  they 
would  have  to  get  construction  permits,  and  everything.  But  it  seemed  like  the  environmental 
impact  would  be  largely  contingent  on  the  size  and  scope  of  the  reactor  planned.  So  I'm  not 
really  understanding  how  you  can  have  a  really  thorough  impact  statement  on  that.  (0007-5-3 
[Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  I  mentioned,  earlier,  that  I'm  confused  about  how  the  NRC  can  do  the  EIS  without 
knowing  anything  about  the  size  or  scope  of  the  reactors.  (0008-4-2  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Response:  The  NRC  action  evaluated  in  this  EIS  is  for  the  NRC  to  either  issue  or  deny  an  ESP 
for  the  possible  future  use  of  the  PSEG  Site  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant:  however,  the 
issuance  of  an  ESP  does  not,  by  itself,  authorize  the  actual  construction  and  operation  of  any 
such  plant.  Because  the  NRC  must  evaluate  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  action  proposed, 
and  because  site  suitability  encompasses  construction  and  operational  parameters,  the  NRC 
review  team  examined  the  impacts  of  both  building  and  operating  hypothetical  nuclear  reactors 
and  their  associated  facilities  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  design  for  such  a  hypothetical  new  plant 
was  based  upon  a  composite  set  of  design  parameters  derived  from  several  nuclear  reactor  and 
power  plant  designs  identified  and  specified  by  PSEG  in  a  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  that 
the  ESP  applicant  expects  would  bound  the  design  characteristics  of  the  reactor  or  reactors  that 
might  be  constructed  at  the  site.  Consequently,  the  NRC  review  team's  evaluation  focused 
upon  the  environmental  effects  of  constructing  and  operating  one  or  more  reactors  that  have 
characteristics  falling  within  the  postulated  PPE,  which  is  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  Section 
3.2  of  this  EIS.  A  specific  design  is  not  needed  because  the  PPE  values  submitted  are 
reasonable  and  sufficient  to  permit  a  meaningful  environmental  analysis.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  in  response  to  these  comments. 

Comment:  I  also  think  that  I  don't  know  if  Delaware  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and 
Environmental  Control  (DNREC)  has  been  consulted.  I  know  they  said  the  New  Jersey 
Department  of  Environment  had  been  consulted.  But  I  think  DNREC,  since  we  are  equally 
impacted,  or  almost  equally  impacted.  It  is  not  on  our  soil  but  Delaware  controls  a  large  part  of 
the  river  also.  I  think  DNREC  should  be  consulting  on  this  project,  too.  (0007-13-9  [Purcell, 

Leslie]) 

Comment:  And  for  those  of  you  who  are  from  public  agencies  in  Delaware,  I  fully  expect  you  to 
comply  in  any  review  you  do,  for  federal  consistency,  wetlands  permits,  or  any  other  thing  we  do 
for  all  the  permits  from  this  site,  with  the  executive  order  issued  by  your  Governor.  (0007-2-9 
[Carter,  David]) 

Response:  These  comments  deal  with  agencies  consulted.  The  agencies  contacted  by  the 
review  team,  including  the  Delaware  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environmental 
Control  (DNREC),  are  those  listed  in  Appendix  B  of  this  EIS.  The  key  consultation 
correspondence  with  State  and  Federal  agencies  are  presented  in  Appendix  F  of  this  EIS.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  in  response  to  these  comments.

Comment:  I  just  wanted  to  echo  some  other  people  who  requested  a  30  day  extension  on  the 
comments.  I  just  found  out  about  this  a  week  ago,  and  I'm  not  sure  if  it  was  my  own  overlooking 
it,  or  what  not.  But  I  think  a  30  day  extension  would  be  wonderful.  (0007-12-1  [Bucic,  Sarah]) 

Comment:  I  would  like  to  reiterate.  I  personally  also  did  not  hear  about  this  meeting  or 
hearing,  until  several  days  ago,  word  of  mouth.  And  so  I  don't  really  know  what  the  public 
outreach  was.  But  I  think  that  is  an  issue  that,  conceivably,  was  not  adequately  performed.  And 
I  would  like  to  ask,  also,  for  a  30  day  extension,  as  this  is  a  rather  large  document.  (0007-13-1 
[Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  So  it  is  a  very  complicated  issue.  And  I  think  that  we  need  a  longer  period  of  time 
to  asses  this,  so  the  30  day  extension  would  certainly  be  reasonable.  (0007-13-8  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  We  hope  we  will  get  the  additional  30  days  to  do  a  truly  detailed  job.  I  think  that  will 
aid  you  in  your  efforts.  And  if  you  truly  do  want  sound  public  inputs,  you  will  give  us  that  extra 
30  days  to  do  the  diligence  that  needs  to  be  done  on  this  project.  (0007-2-19  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  I  will  start  out  by  asking  that  a  30  day  extension,  on  this  public  record,  be  extended 
to  the  State  of  Delaware.  We  are  very  glad  that  our  congressional  delegation  was  able  to  have, 

I  believe,  our  first-ever  hearing  for  the  Salem  nuclear  power  plants  here  in  Delaware.  Our 
residents  are  not  aware  of  it,  they  don't  have  the  opportunity.  The  folks  in  New  Jersey  have  had 
a  much  larger,  more  extensive  time  to  review  this.  And  I  just  think,  if  you  really  are  sincere 
about  getting  comments,  that  it  isn't  that  much  to  ask,  considering  the  amount  of  time  it  takes  for 
this  process.  (0007-2-2  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  I  would  like  to  start  out,  I  know  that  this  is  not  a  question  session.  But  I'm  curious 
about  how  this  meeting  was  publicly  noticed.  Because  I  didn't  see  a  public  notice  in  any 
newspaper,  or  anything  like  that.  And  when  I  saw  the  article  that  Jeff  Montgomery  wrote  in  the 
News  Journal,  which  I  was  very,  very  happy  to  see,  given  that  I  have  never  even  heard  about 
this,  before  that,  I  started  looking  for  that  public  notice,  everywhere,  thinking  that  I  just  missed  it. 
And  I  really  searched  pretty  hard  on  the  internet,  and  the  only  thing  I  could  find  was  the  notice 
that  is  in  the  packet.  And  that  was  on  the  NRC's  website,  which  I  understand  was  published 
around  October  9th.  And  I  am  wondering  who  you  think  is  just  browsing  the  NRC's  website 
looking  for  these  things?  Because  that  is  certainly  something  that  I  do  or,  really,  that  anyone  I 
know  does.  And  assuming  that  this  was  appropriately  noticed,  which  maybe  it  was,  and  maybe 
I  missed  it,  it  was  noticed  on  October  9th,  which  was  14  days  ago,  which  I  understand  is  within 
the  legal  limit  that  you  are  required  to  notice  such  a  meeting.  (0007-5-1  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  However,  I  really  don't  have  a  lot  of  real  good  technical  comments  to  make  on  this 
Draft  Environmental  Impact  Statement,  given  that  it  was  1 ,400  pages  long,  and  I  have  a  job  and, 
you  know,  life.  And  I  only  found  out  about  this  less  than  two  weeks  ago.  So  that  is  concerning. 
And  the  reason  why  I  don't  have  better  comments.  (0007-5-2  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  I  appreciate  you  explain  to  me,  further,  that  this  process,  I'm  still  concerned  about 
the  extremely  short  notice  of  this  public  meeting,  which  is  not  a  public  hearing.  And  I  will  look 
into  that,  it  being  noticed  a  week  ago.  But  given  that  this  is  an  extremely  detailed  and, 
hopefully,  very  thorough  and  long  Draft  Environmental  Impact  Statement,  I  do  still  think  that  a 


November  2015

NUREG-2168 


Appendix  E 


week  or  even  two  weeks  is  too  short.  And  I  would  ask  that  you  extend  the  public  comment 
period  at  least  30  days  so  people  have  a  better  opportunity  to  look  into  the  full  Draft 
Environmental  Impact  Statement,  and  come  up  with  some  really  thorough  and  relevant 
comments.  (0008-4-1  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  I  note  that  you  had  two  public  meetings  in  New  Jersey  on  October  1.  Delaware 
seems  to  have  been  overlooked,  therefore  we  have  less  time  to  absorb  your  recommendations. 
The  Delaware  meetings  were  poorly  advertised.  (0019-2  [Passmore,  Wills]) 

Response:  These  comments  reflect  the  commenters'  opinion  that  the  public  comment  period 
for  the  draft  EIS  is  too  short;  hence,  they  request  an  extension  of  that  period.  The  NRC  issued 
the  draft  EIS  for  public  comment  on  August  22,  2014,  and  a  75-day  comment  period  began  at 
that  time.  Two  sets  of  public  meetings  were  held  during  this  comment  period:  an  afternoon  and 
an  evening  meeting  in  Carneys  Point,  New  Jersey  on  October  7  and  an  afternoon  and  an 
evening  meeting  in  Middletown,  Delaware  on  October  23.  These  public  meetings  were 
announced  in  local  newspapers  including,  the  Wilmington  News  Journal,  the  South  Jersey 
Times ,  the  Cumberland  and  Salem  Guide,  and  the  Middletown  Transcript.  In  response  to  these 
comments,  the  NRC  extended  the  75-day  comment  by  an  additional  30  days  (until  December  6, 
2014)  to  allow  the  public  and  agencies  additional  time  to  comment.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  And  I  want  to  thank  our  congressional  delegation  for  making  sure  that  this  hearing 
is  taking  place  in  Delaware.  And  I  hope  that  the  NRC  will  make  this  a  regular  practice,  since 
this  cycle,  the  circle  of  potential  impact,  from  this  plant,  includes  Delaware.  And  we  shouldn't  let 
that  be  overlooked.  (0007-11-2  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  assesses  potential  impacts  to  resources  in  Delaware  throughout  the 
EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  And  I  would  really  appreciate,  for  a  change,  as  Dr.  Carter  said,  about  having  a 
meeting  here,  and  letting  us  know  what  is  going  on.  Because,  before,  we  had  to  go  down  to 
Rockford,  Maryland,  and  get  out  information,  have  bake  sales,  to  fight  you  guys,  over  these 
plants.  (0007-3-18  [August,  Bernard]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  has  held  meetings  regarding  the  proposed  action  in  both  New 
Jersey  and  Delaware.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  I  was  just,  now,  delighted  to  hear  the  manager,  from  PSEG,  talk  about  their 
proactive  role  in  working  with  the  citizens.  This  is  the  first  time  we  have  ever  been  able  to  get 
NRC  and  PSEG  and  the  groups  over  here  to  involve  Delaware's  public.  So  we  hope  you  will  be 
very  proactive.  I  can't  say  that  it  was  a  delightful  experience  to  have  you  come  and  hold  this 
hearing  tonight.  There  were  some  people  that  just  didn't  want  to  hold  it.  So  I'm  very  delighted 
to  hear  and  I  hope  that  PSEG  will  continue  to  press,  and  press  forward,  to  engage  Delaware's 
public,  where  80  percent  of  the  people,  within  the  impacted  range,  if  there  is  an  accident,  or  a 
problem  occur.  And  I  think  there  is  a  lot  of  education  that  could  take  place,  and  a  lot  of  other 
learning.  (0008-8-1  [Carter,  David])

Comment:  The  proposed  plant  site  is  located  outside  the  boundaries  of  the  State  of  Delaware. 
However,  the  closest  residence  is  actually  located  in  Delaware,  and  the  population  is  higher  in 
Delaware  than  New  Jersey  in  proximity  to  the  PSEG  site.  As  of  the  2010  census  40,943 
Delaware  residents  lived  within  the  10-mile  emergency  planning  zone  of  the  Salem/Hope  Creek 
Nuclear  Power  Plant  in  New  Jersey.  In  contrast,  the  same  year  census  data  shows  only  12,521 
New  Jersey  residents  in  the  same  zone.  This  information  is  presently  to  illustrate  the 
uniqueness  of  this  situation  in  that  a  nuclear  facility  entirely  contained  in  one  state  and 
generating  power  solely  for  the  benefit  of  that  state,  is  in  fact  closer  geographically  to  denser 
population  centers  in  the  adjacent  state.  These  residents  share  the  potential  risk  from  a 
catastrophic  event,  but  do  not  benefit  directly  from  the  energy  derived  from  the  proposed  plant 
nor  from  the  predicted  tax  revenue.  With  this  consideration  in  mind,  the  NRC  should  give  as 
much  deference  to  affected  adjacent  states  as  given  to  the  state  within  which  the  facility  may  be 
constructed.  (0023-1-3  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  has  consulted  with  Delaware  State  agencies  on  the  proposed 
action,  assessed  the  proposed  action's  potential  impacts  on  resources  in  Delaware  throughout 
the  EIS,  and  conducted  a  draft  EIS  public  comment  meeting  in  Delaware.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  While  the  willingness  of  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  and  U.S.  Army  Corps 
of  Engineers  to  hold  an  information  session  and  public  meeting  in  Delaware  was  appreciated,  it 
is  important  to  note  that  the  limited  notice  (only  nine  days)  provided  to  Delaware  residents 
undoubtedly  hindered  the  turnout.  This  oversight  was,  in  part,  ameliorated  by  the  thirty-day 
extension  of  the  public  comment  period.  (0023-1-2  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  has  consulted  with  Delaware  State  agencies  on  the  proposed  action 
and  assessed  the  proposed  action's  potential  impacts  on  resources  in  Delaware  throughout  the 
EIS.  As  noted  in  this  comment,  the  NRC  extended  the  draft  EIS  comment  period  by  30  days 
(until  December  6,  2014)  to  allow  the  public  and  agencies  additional  time  to  comment.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  You  mentioned  that  the  company  can  bank  the  site  for  up  to  20  years,  which  I  knew 
from  reading  the  Reader's  Guide.  And  that  that  would  be  a  way  to  help  them  leverage,  have 
leverage,  when  they  are  negotiating  with  reactor  vendors,  some  time  in  the  future.  But  it  just 
seems  to  me  that  the  duty  of  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  is  to  protect  the  interest  of  the 
public,  not  the  interest  of  the  nuclear  company,  in  protecting  their  profit,  and  getting  a  good  deal 
on  a  reactor  in  the  future.  (0007-5-4  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Response:  The  ESP  process  provides  for  early  resolution  of  siting  issues  in  a  manner 
consistent  with  the  NRC's  mission  of  protecting  people  and  the  environment.  Draft  EIS  Section 
1. 1  states  that  with  an  approved  ESP,  "the  applicant  can  "bank"  the  site  for  up  to  20 years  for 
future  reactor  siting  and,  if  a  limited  work  authorization  is  also  requested  and  granted,  can 
conduct  certain  site-preparation  and  preliminary  construction  activities  enumerated  in  Title  10  of 
the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  50. 10(e)(1)  (10  CFR  50-TN249). "  The  draft  EIS 
mentions  nothing  about  leverage  on  negotiations  with  reactor  vendors.  No  changes  were  made 
to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment.

Response:  These  comments  request  editorial  changes.  The  text  in  the  EIS  has  been  revised 
in  response  to  these  comments. 

Comment:  Page  No.  7-48;  Section  No.  7.12;  Line  No.  9;  DEIS  Section  7.12  is  titled 
"Conclusions  and  Recommendations";  No  recommendations  are  provided  in  Section  7.12. 
(0015-11-16  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  This  comment  is  correct,  so  the  words  "and  Recommendations"  have  been  deleted 
from  EIS  Section  7. 12  heading. 

Comment:  In  light  of  our  concerns  on  the  project's  impacts  to  wetlands  and  the  related 
mitigation  needs,  EPA  has  rated  the  DEIS  as  "EC-2"  ,  meaning  that  EPA  review  identified 
environmental  impacts  that  if  avoided,  would  more  fully  protect  the  environment.  (0017-4 
[Mitchell,  Judy-Ann]) 

Response:  The  review  team  appreciates  the  review  of  the  draft  EIS  that  was  conducted  by  the 
U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA).  The  EPA  rating  of  EC-2  is  noted.  No  change 
has  been  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  particular  comment;  however,  the  additional 
comments  received  in  the  enclosure  from  the  EPA  have  been  cataloged  and  are  addressed 
under  the  respective  categories  for  those  separate  comments  and  concerns. 

Comment:  We  request  that  the  Atomic  Safety  and  Licensing  Board  (ASLB)  conduct  a

future  use  of  the  PSEG  site  to  construct  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  (0020-1-1  [van

Comment:  A  Contested  Hearing  is  needed  on  this  highly  controversial  and  environmentally 
damaging  proposal.  DRN  would  like  to  request  a  contested  hearing  be  scheduled  by  the  ASLB 
and  held  regarding  this  application  and  proposal.  Construction  of  a  fourth  nuclear  plant  on 
Artificial  Island,  in  an  area  predicted  to  be  consistently  under  or  surrounded  by  water  in  just  a 
few  decades  to  come  and  in  a  place  where  hundreds  of  acres  of  wetlands  are  to  be  further 
damaged  by  PSEG,  is  an  obvious  danger  and  threat  to  the  region,  highly  controversial,  and 
deserves  a  public  airing  and  hearing  before  the  NRC  renders  a  decision.  (0020-1-4  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Comment:  A  Contested  Hearing  is  needed  on  this  highly  controversial  and  environmentally

Comment:  A  Contested  Hearing  is  needed  on  this  highly  controversial  and  environmentally 
damaging  proposal.  We  request  that  the  Atomic  Safety  and  Licensing  Board  (ASLB)  conduct  a 
contested  hearing.  (0034-3  [Carter,  David]  [DePaul,  Shelly]  [Furst,  Charles]  [Hvozdovich,  Steve] 
[McNutt,  Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [Owens,  Caroline]  [Pringle,  David]  [Roe,  Amy]  [Tittel,  Jeff]  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Requests  to  participate  in  a  hearing  on  an  NRC  license  application  must  be  made 
in  accordance  with  the  NRC's  regulations  in  10  CFR  Part  2.  The  public  opportunity  to  request  a 
hearing  on  the  PSEG  ESP  application,  and  the  procedures  and  deadlines  for  doing  so,  was 
announced  in  a  Federal  Register  notice  shortly  after  the  application  was  docketed  (See  75  FR 
68624;  November  8,  2010).  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  original  language  of  the  standards  for  review  of 
applications  clearly  stated  that  "the  draft  and  final  environmental  impact  statements  prepared  by 
the  Commission  focus  on  the  environmental  effects  of  construction  and  operation  of  a  reactor  or 
reactors  ..."  [See,  54  F.R.  15388,  10  C.F.R.  §52.18  (1989)].  While  that  may  have  been  the 
case,  it  is  not  the  current  status  of  the  10  C.F.R.  §52.18  regulations  and  it  raises  serious 
questions  as  to  how  this  ESP  process  has  "evolved"  and  if  the  current  ESP  process  is  at  all  in 
conformance  with  all  NEPA  requirements.  (0020-1-8  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  regulatory  provision  to  which  the  commenter  refers  (quoting  from  a  1989 
rulemaking)  was  subsequently  relocated  to  a  different  part  NRC's  regulations,  but  the  regulatory 
intent  did  not  change.  The  NRC  has  promulgated  environmental  protection  regulations 
applicable  to  its  domestic  licensing  and  regulatory  functions  in  10  CFR  5 1  and  implements 
NEPA  Section  102(2)  in  Subpart  A  of  10  CFR  51.  In  a  rulemaking  subsequent  to  the  one 
quoted  in  the  above  comment,  the  NRC  moved  text  quoted  from  the  1989  version  of  10  CFR 
52.18  to  10  CFR  51.50  "Environmental  report— construction  permit,  early  site  permit,  or 
combined  license  stage. "  In  the  same  rulemaking,  the  NRC  also  edited  10  CFR  51.71  "Draft 
environmental  impact  statement— contents"  at  10  CFR  51.71(a)  to  require  draft  EISs  to  address 
the  matters  specified  in  section  51.50.  The  change  in  location  of  the  quoted  text  specifies  that 
the  applicant  must  address  the  same  issues  in  the  environmental  report  (ER)  submitted  with  its

Appendix  E 


application  that  the  agency  must  also  address  in  the  draft  EIS.  The  text  of  10  CFR  51  therefore 
clarifies  the  NRC's  efforts  to  comply  with  NEPA  requirements.  As  reflected  in  the  draft  EIS  for 
the  PSEG  ESP,  in  its  ESP  review  the  NRC  does  consider  the  environmental  effects  of 
construction  and  operation  of  a  reactor  at  the  proposed  site.  The  comment  does  not  identify 
any  deficiency  in  the  NRC's  evaluation  of  ESP  applications  under  NEPA.  No  changes  to  the 
EIS  were  made  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Limited  Work  Authorization  for  this  project  is  a  violation  of  due  process.  Limited 
Work  Authorization  on  this  property  may  be  a  violation  of  due  process  since  it  further  commits 
both  the  NRC  and  PSEG  on  a  track  for  nuclear  permitting  approval  without  providing  the  public 
with  notice  and  an  opportunity  to  be  heard.  (0020-1-13  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  As  the  NRC  explains  in  draft  EIS  Section  1.1.2,  PSEG  is  not  requesting  a  limited 
work  authorization  in  its  ESP  application.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were  made  as  a  result  of  this 
comment. 

Comment:  Since  the  ESP  has  nothing  to  do  with  nuclear  power,  the  NRC  should  not  be  the 
lead  agency  preparing  this  Environmental  Impact  Statement.  Since  ESP  does  not  involve 
anything  nuclear,  then  the  NRC  should  not  be  the  lead  federal  agency  preparing  this  DEIS. 
Nothing  in  the  ESP  relates  to  nuclear  energy  or  reactor  design  issues;  it  all  relates  to  questions 
of  site  suitability,  land  use  impacts,  water-related  impacts,  wetlands  impacts,  endangered 
species  impacts,  historic  and  cultural  resource  impacts,  ecological  impacts  and  environmental 
justice  impacts.  (0020-1-14  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  While  the  NRC  will  ultimately  license  a  reactor,  the  ESP  Process  is  entirely 
environmental,  thus  the  lead  agency  should  be  an  agency  trained  in  investigating  and  analyzing 
site  environmental  conditions,  like  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  or  the  U.S. 
Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (FWS).  The  NRC  may  state  that  it  has  contacted  these  agencies  for 
input,  but  there  is  no  comparison  to  actually  making  that  agency  the  lead  agency  or  a 
cooperating  agency.  The  NRC  should  therefore  revise  the  scope  of  this  DEIS  to  make  the  EPA 
and  FWS  lead  or  cooperating  agencies  and  not  just  passive  contributors.  In  addition,  the  use  of 
the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  as  a  cooperating  agency  is  not  a  sufficient  means 
to  adequately  analyze  environmental  impacts  for  this  DEIS,  since  its  statutory  mission  is  not 
centered  on  protecting  the  environment.  (0020-1-15  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Although  an  ESP  does  not  authorize  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  nuclear 
facility,  an  ESP  is  an  NRC  approval  for  a  site  for  one  or  more  nuclear  power  facilities,  and  it  is 
issued  pursuant  to  the  NRC's  authority  under  the  Atomic  Energy  Act.  Because  the  NRC  is  the 
agency  taking  the  "major  Federal  action"  for  NEPA  Section  102  purposes,  it  is  the  agency  that 
must  prepare  an  EIS  for  the  PSEG  ESP  application. 

The  review  of  the  ESP  application  is  also  not  solely  an  environmental  review;  to  receive  an 
ESP,  an  applicant  must  demonstrate  the  suitability  of  the  site  from  a  safety  standpoint,  such  as 
identifying  the  natural  hazards  (e.g.,  flooding  and  earthquakes)  that  a  facility  at  the  site  would 
need  to  be  protected  against.  The  staff's  safety  review  of  the  ESP  application  is  documented  in 
a  safety  evaluation  report  (SER)  separate  from  the  EIS.

Appendix  E 


Consistent  with  NEPA,  the  NRC  coordinates  the  development  of  its  EISs  with  other  agencies 
that  may  have  relevant  expertise  or  related  permitting  authority  (e.g.,  the  USACE),  and  it 
consults  with  other  agencies  as  part  of  its  compliance  with  other  environmental  statutes;  for 
example,  it  engages  in  consultation  with  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (FWS)  and  the 
National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  ( NMFS )  (collectively  "The  Services")  pursuant  to 
requirements  stated  in  the  Endangered  Species  Act  (ESA). 

No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  It  is  premature  to  prepare  an  EIS  for  an  applicant  that  does  not  even  own  the  land 
upon  which  this  nuclear  power  plant  will  be  constructed.  PSEG  does  not  presently  own  all  of 
the  land  upon  which  the  proposed  nuclear  power  plant  and  its  accompanying  structures  will  be 
built.  It  may  own  it  in  the  future  or  it  may  not,  but  right  now  through  the  issuance  of  this  DEIS, 
the  NRC  is  taking  official  agency  action  based  upon  speculation.  Agencies  of  the  federal 
government  are  not  authorized  to  devote  agency  resources,  unless  otherwise  approved,  for 
speculative  activities.  This  DEIS  is  just  such  a  speculative  wasteful  agency  endeavor,  since 
until  such  time  as  PSEG  can  demonstrate  bona  fide  ownership  (or  permission  to  use  all)  of  this 
property,  it  is  premature  for  the  NRC  to  prepare  this  DEIS  or  any  agency  documents  related  to 
this  premature  proposal.  (0020-1-16  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  Since  this  [land  swap]  trade  has  not  happened,  any  preparation  of  a  DEIS  is 
premature  and  purely  speculative  as  to  the  outcome  of  the  full  ownership  of  the  property  in 
question.  Federal  agencies  are  not  allowed  under  any  law  to  issue  permits  based  upon 
speculative  information,  since  the  ultimate  decision  and  any  judicial  review  of  such  will  likely 
show  that  it  was  arbitrary  and  capricious.  Since  the  NRC  is  contemplating  the  issuance  of  a 
permit,  it  has  done  exactly  that  and  any  permit  issued  based  upon  an  incomplete  application, 
such  as  this  one,  will  likely  be  invalidated  if  challenged  in  Court.  While  Courts  wil  1  not  often 
substitute  their  judgment  for  agency  decisions  based  upon  conformity  with  agency  substantive 
expertise,  they  will  readily  strike  down  decisions  of  agencies  that  do  not  follow  their  own 
procedural  requirements.  The  preparation  of  the  DEIS  and  the  intent  of  the  NRC  to  issue  the 
ESP  at  this  time  is  just  such  an  example  of  procedural  error,  readily  subject  to  challenge.  (0020- 
1-18  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Although  an  ESP  does  not  authorize  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  nuclear 
facility,  an  ESP  is  an  NRC  approval  for  a  site  for  one  or  more  nuclear  power  facilities.  By 
demonstrating  that  a  site  is  suitable  from  a  safety  and  environmental  standpoint,  issuance  of  an 
ESP  usefully  informs  an  applicant's  future  decision  whether  to  apply  for  a  construction  permit  or 
combined  license,  and  provides  greater  regulatory  efficiency  in  the  event  such  an  application  is 
ultimately  submitted.  PSEG  has  an  agreement  in  principle  with  USACE  to  acquire  an  additional 
85  ac  of  USACE  Artificial  Island  Confined  Disposal  Facility  (CDF)  land  immediately  north  of  the 
Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  ( HCGS )  as  explained  in  Section  2.2. 7  of  the  draft  EIS.  Neither 
the  Atomic  Energy  Act  nor  the  NRC's  regulations  require  rejection  of  the  ESP  application  due  to 
the  existence  of  PSEG 's  agreement  in  principle  with  USACE.  Because  the  NRC  determined 
that  the  application  contained  the  necessary  information  for  the  NRC  to  undertake  its  detailed 
safety  and  environmental  review,  the  NRC's  regulations  require  the  NRC  to  prepare  an  EIS  for 
the  application. 


November  2015 


E-29 


NUREG-2168 


Appendix  E 


The  NRC  requires  assurance  that  the  applicant  will  have  sufficient  control  over  the  site  and 
exclusion  area  in  order  to  grant  an  ESP.  The  NRC  is  addressing  this  issue  as  part  of  the  safety 
review  of  the  ESP  application  by  requiring  a  permit  condition  that  will  require  PSEG  to  obtain 
legal  authority  from  the  USACE  to  either  allow  PSEG  and  its  surrogates  to  determine  all 
activities  including  exclusion  or  removal  of  personnel  and  property  from  the  area  or  require  that 
the  USACE  exercise  control  in  a  specified  manner.  The  commenter  does  not  explain  how  these 
concerns  about  land  ownership  indicate  any  deficiency  in  the  draft  EIS's  evaluation  of 
environmental  impacts.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Since  the  DEIS  fails  to  include  comments  from  contributing  agencies,  NRC  should 
leave  the  record  open  for  comments  for  an  additional  60  Days.  Since  many  other  federal 
agencies  will  likely  provide  comments,  notably  EPA  and  FWS,  the  public  is  precluded  from 
reviewing  and  commenting  on  their  submissions  due  to  the  NRC  having  closed  the  comment 
period.  These  federal  agencies  may  raise  other  significant  issues  and  the  public  should  have 
the  opportunity  to  provide  comments  on  their  submissions  before  the  issuance  of  the  Final  EIS. 
Since  all  of  these  comments  can  be  posted  with  on-line  access,  DRN  requests  that  the  NRC 
post  all  of  these  comments  and  then  leave  the  record  open  for  an  additional  60  days  so  that  the 
public  may  have  the  opportunity  to  supplement  their  comments  to  include  this  additional 
information.  (0020-2-1  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response :  During  the  scoping  period  and  development  of  the  draft  EIS,  the  NRC  obtained 
Input  from  many  sources,  including  from  other  Federal  agencies,  and  that  information  is 
reflected  in  the  analysis  in  the  draft  EIS.  In  particular,  the  USACE,  as  a  cooperating  agency, 
worked  directly  with  the  staff  in  developing  the  analysis.  Appendix  A  of  the  draft  EIS  contains  a 
list  of  all  contributors  to  the  draft  EIS,  including  other  Federal  agencies  and  national 
laboratories.  Appendix  B  of  the  draft  EIS  lists  the  organizations  contacted  in  preparation  of  the 
draft  EIS.  These  organizations  include  Federal  and  State  agencies,  and  their  input  is  discussed 
in  various  sections  throughout  the  draft  EIS.  Appendix  C  describes  the  chronology  of  NRC  and 
USACE  staff  environmental  review  correspondence  related  to  the  PSEG  application  for  an  ESP 
at  the  PSEG  Site.  Appendix  F  includes  key  consultation  correspondence  between  the  NRC  and 
the  FWS  and  NMFS,  including  the  NRC's  biological  assessments  of  ESA-listed  species,  and 
various  State  and  Tribal  organizations  involved  with  National  Historic  Preservation  Act 
consultation.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  use  of  eleven  pages  of  acronyms  and  abbreviations  ("AA")  in  the  DEIS 
confuses  the  public  and  frustrates  the  NEPA  process.  .  .  .  The  use  of  many  of  most  of  these 
AAs  is  unnecessary,  and  it  creates  confusing  and  potentially  misleading  information  to  be 
presented  without  sufficient  public  understanding  of  the  DEIS.  .  .  .  While  the  use  of  common 
and  known  acronyms  can  facilitate  reading  a  document  more  quickly,  the  eleven  pages  used  in 
the  DEIS  is  excessive,  especially  when  many  of  these  terms  are  not  known  or  may  have 
multiple  meanings.  (0020-2-2  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  has  taken  a  number  of  measures  to  enhance  the  readability  and 
understanding  of  the  content  of  the  draft  EIS  for  the  public.  For  terms  that  appear  frequently  in 
the  draft  EIS,  the  NRC  uses  acronyms  and  abbreviations  to  facilitate  both  consistency  and 
efficiency.  The  NRC  considers  it  helpful  to  identify  those  terms  at  the  beginning  of  the 
document:  accordingly,  a  list  of  the  definitions  of  the  acronyms  and  abbreviations  used

throughout  the  draft  EIS  is  found  on  pages  xxxi  through  xli  of  the  draft  EIS.  Elowever,  these 
acronyms  are  also  defined  where  they  first  appear  in  the  text  of  the  draft  EIS.  The  draft  EIS 
contains  an  Abstract  and  an  Executive  Summary  to  aid  overall  understanding  of  the 
organization  and  findings  contained  in  the  draft  EIS.  The  NRC  has  also  published  a  "Reader's 
Guide"  which  provides  a  high-level  summary  of  the  findings  described  in  more  detail  in  the  draft 
EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  impact  of  new  transmission  lines  should  have  been  included  in  the  DEIS. 
Failure  to  analyze  the  impacts  of  new  transmission  lines  is  yet  another  example  of  the 
segmentation  allowed  by  NRC  for  this  project.  The  failure  to  include  this  impact  information  in 
the  DEIS  is  a  glaring  omission  by  the  NRC  and  demonstrates  that  this  DEIS  fails  to  comply  with 
the  requirements  of  NEPA  to  give  a  hard  look  at  this  power  plant  proposal.  A  new  nuclear 
power  plant  will  require  new  very  large  transmission  lines  and  rights  of  way  to  be  acquired.  The 
DEIS  lists  this  issue  (p  7-8)  but  fails  to  include  any  analysis  of  these  transmission  lines  and  their 
impacts  in  the  needs  analysis,  in  the  alternatives  analysis,  or  in  the  cumulative  impacts  analysis. 
PJM  has  recommended  the  construction  of  new  transmission  lines,  and  the  DEIS  is  inadequate 
without  performing  this  analysis.  This  failure  is  an  issue,  since  a  thorough  and  objective 
analysis  of  transmission  lines  would  have  also  shown  that  this  location  is  a  poor  choice  for 
building  another  power  plant.  (0020-4-16  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  PSEG's  proposed  action  does  not  include  the  construction  and  operation  of  new 
transmission  lines  to  support  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  EIS 
Chapter  7  addresses  the  cumulative  impacts  of  the  existing  transmission  lines  from  the  PSEG 
Site  as  well  as  the  potential  impacts  of  a  new  transmission  line  that  could  be  constructed  near 
the  PSEG  Site  to  address  grid  stability  issues  in  the  region.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS 
as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  10-9;  Section  No.  10.2.1;  Table  10-1;  Table  10-1  appears  to  be  missing 
an  entry  for  Fuel  Cycle,  Transportation,  and  Decommissioning,  which  would  have  a  SMALL 
adverse  impact  during  construction  and  preconstruction.  This  change  would  make  it  consistent 
with  Exhibit  H  of  the  Reader's  Guide.  Or  if  the  impacts  are  considered  non-existent,  then  this 
should  be  stated  and  the  Reader's  Guide  modified.  (0015-7-7  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  Table  10-  1  in  this  EIS  addresses  construction  and  preconstruction  impacts,  and 
there  are  no  fuel-cycle,  transportation  and  decommissioning  impacts  during  these  activities. 
These  impacts  are  included  in  Table  10-2  (operational  impacts).  No  changes  were  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  NRC  should  revise  the  DEIS  to  include  an  evaluation  of  specific  measures  done  to 
avoid  and  minimize  impacts  [to  wetlands],  and  this  evaluation  should  be  subject  to  public 
comment.  (0020-2-11  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  NRC  should  not  prematurely  grant  approval  before  it  can  properly  demonstrate, 
with  any  degree  of  certainty,  that  proper  environmental  mitigation  measures  have  been  fully 
agreed  upon  and  evaluated.  Furthermore,  the  mitigation  measures  and  mitigation  plan  should 
be  subject  to  public  review.  (0020-3-1  [van  Rossum,  Maya])

NUREG-2168 


Appendix  E 


Response:  The  NRC  regulations  at  10  CFR  51.45  require  applicants  for  NRC  approvals  to 
include,  in  their  ERs,  an  analysis  that  considers  and  balances  the  environmental  effects  of  the 
proposed  action,  the  environmental  impacts  of  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action,  and 
alternatives  available  for  reducing  or  avoiding  adverse  environmental  effects.  The  regulations 
at  W  CFR  51.71(a)  require  the  NRC  to  address,  in  draft  EISs,  the  matters  specified  in  10  CFR 
51.45.  Accordingly,  the  NRC  has  analyzed  measures  to  mitigate  environmental  impacts  of  the 
proposed  action  in  various  impact  categories  throughout  the  draft  EIS.  As  solicited  in  the 
Federal  Register  notice  of  publication  of  the  draft  FIS  (79  FR  49820;  August  22,  2014)  and  in 
accordance  with  10  CFR  51. 73,  the  NRC  accepted  public  comments  on  the  draft  FIS  from 
August  22  to  December  6,  2014,  including  during  public  meetings  held  on  October  1  and 
October  23,  2014. 

Mitigation  of  impacts,  including  impacts  to  wetlands,  is  discussed  in  Chapters  4,  5,  7,  and  9  of 
the  draft  FIS.  Independently,  the  US  ACE  will  be  addressing  any  necessary  mitigation,  including 
compensation,  as  a  part  of  any  Department  of  the  Army  authorization  pursuant  to  33  CFR  332. 
When  discussing  mitigation  in  the  draft  EIS,  the  staff  specified  where  Federal,  State,  or  local 
laws  require  the  mitigation  measures  or  if  there  is,  or  is  expected  to  be,  a  Federal,  State,  or  local 
permit  that  requires  the  particular  measures.  The  draft  EIS  discusses  where  requirements  are 
being  or  are  likely  to  be  imposed  by  the  regulatory  agency  with  authority  over  the  resource  in 
question  and  how,  if  at  all,  the  staff  relied  on  the  mitigation  to  determine  the  impact  level  by 
discussing  how  the  mitigation  will  be  accomplished  and  whether  the  mitigation  would  affect  the 
impact  level  conclusion.  The  draft  EIS  also  considered  mitigation  measures  that  are  considered 
best  management  practices  where  they  are  standard  industry  construction  practices  or  integral 
parts  of  the  project.  For  example,  in  Section  4. 3. 1.4  of  this  FIS,  the  staff  discusses  measures 
for  restoration  and  rehabilitation  that  could  be  required  in  permits  issued  by  US  ACE  or  New 
Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP),  which  would  further  minimize 
potential  impacts.  As  another  example,  in  Section  4. 1 1,  the  staff  described  certain  mitigation 
measures  that  the  applicant  proposed  to  minimize  impacts  during  construction  activities. 

Therefore,  the  draft  EIS  has  appropriately  considered  mitigation  and  explained  the  significance 
of  those  measures  for  its  impact  conclusions.  The  public  has  had  the  opportunity  to  comment 
on  the  mitigation  measures  discussed  in  the  draft  FIS.  The  commenter  did  not  identify  any 
specific  concern  with  the  mitigation  measures  discussed  in  the  draft  EIS  or  identify  any 
additional  mitigation  measures  that  should  have  been  considered.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  This  document  does  indicate  that  sea  level  rise  and  flooding  impacts  will  be  further 
evaluated  in  the  Safety  Evaluation  Report,  however,  incorporating  detailed  information  about 
climate  change,  sea  level  rise  and  flooding  during  initial  planning  is  critically  important.  To 
evaluate  these  impacts  only  in  the  context  of  the  Safety  Evaluation  Report  is  at  odds  with  the 
intent  of  the  NEPA  process.  The  final  EIS  should  clearly  define  the  future  climate  change  and 
sea  level  rise  scenarios  that  were  utilized  in  this  analysis  and  should  utilize  several  different 
climate  scenarios  to  ensure  that  the  full  range  of  climate  consequences  for  the  site,  its 
operations,  the  Delaware  River  and  surrounding  areas  were  considered.  Due  to  the  site's 
proximity  to  tidal  water  and  the  expected  lifespan  of  this  facility,  climate  change  and  sea  level 
rise  should  be  a  lens  under  which  all  design  and  siting  decisions  for  this  facility  are  viewed.

Response:  Climate  change  was  considered  as  one  of  the  contributing  factors  to  the  cumulative 
impacts  of  the  proposed  action  and  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  actions  in 
Chapter  7  of  the  EIS.  In  assessing  the  contribution  of  climate  change  to  cumulative  impacts,  the 
review  team  relied  primarily  on  results  from  the  most  recent  report  of  the  U.S.  Global  Change 
Research  Program  (GCRP)  as  documented  in  " Climate  Change  Impacts  in  the  United  States: 
The  Third  National  Climate  Assessment"  (GCRP  2014-TN3472),  which  considered  a  range  of 
future  scenarios.  The  review  team  also  considered  the  results  from  other  studies  that 
addressed  climate  change  impacts  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin  (e.g.,  US  ACE  and  DRBC  2008- 
TN3040,  Pope  and  Gordon  1999-TN3006).  The  future  climate  scenarios  considered  in  these 
studies  may  have  differed  from  those  included  in  the  GCRP  report. 

The  NRC  staff  disagrees  with  the  claim  made  in  the  comment  that  "To  evaluate  these  impacts 
only  in  the  context  of  the  SER  is  at  odds  with  the  intent  of  the  NEPA  process.  "As  explained  in 
the  preceding  paragraph,  the  impacts  have  been  considered  in  the  EIS.  Furthermore,  the 
NRC's  review  of  the  ESP  application  is  not  solely  an  environmental  review;  that  is,  in  order  to 
receive  an  ESP,  an  applicant  must  demonstrate  the  suitability  of  the  site  from  a  safety 
standpoint,  such  as  identifying  the  natural  hazards  (e.g.,  flooding  and  earthquakes)  that  a  new 
nuclear  plant  at  the  site  would  need  to  be  protected  against.  The  NRC  staff's  safety  review  of 
the  PSEG  ESP  application  will  be  documented  in  an  SER  separate  from  the  EIS.  The  SER 
analyzes  all  aspects  of  reactor  and  operational  safety  related  to  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  The  NRC  will  make  its  decision  on  whether  to  grant  or  deny  the  ESP  application  for 
the  PSEG  Site  based  on  both  safety  and  environmental  considerations,  thereby  complying  with 
the  spirit  and  intent  of  NEPA.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Decommissioning  also  raises  the  critical  concern  that  the  DEIS  fails  to  identify  and 
analyze  the  terminology  of  a  "life  cycle  analysis"  (a.k.a.  life  cycle  assessment  or  total  cost 
assessment)  into  this  whole  proposal  to  build  a  nuclear  power  plant.  Life  cycle  analysis  is  also 
the  only  standard  method  (ISP  14040  series  international  standards)  capable  of  assessing 
environmental  impacts  through  the  entire  process  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  from  the  mining, 
refining  of  nuclear  fuel,  to  the  resources  necessary  to  build  a  plant,  to  the  irreversible 
environmental  and  social  impacts,  to  the  operation,  and  then  ultimately  the  demolition,  disposal 
and  restoration  of  the  site.  It  will  include  all  of  the  financial  costs,  environmental  impacts  and  an 
attempt  to  identify  if  constructing  the  facility  actually  makes  sense  in  the  long  term.  Without  this 
whole  life  cycle  approach,  highly  polluting  stages  associated  with  the  facility  could  be 
overlooked.  For  instance,  if  one  were  to  study  just  the  operational  phase  of  a  nuclear  power 
plant,  such  as  has  been  done  in  the  DEIS,  one  could  conclude  that  it  produces  less  pollution 
than  other  sources.  However,  if  you  look  at  other  life  components  of  the  plant,  like  the  costs  of 
construction,  the  costs  of  securing  radioactive  components,  the  high  costs  of  decommissioning 
and  transportation  and  disposal  costs  of  low-level  radioactive  wastes  660  miles  away,  the 
viability  and  the  costs  of  dealing  with  the  storage  and  the  long  term  disposal  of  high  level 
radioactive  wastes  or  a  nuclear  accident  (Three  Mile  Island,  Chernobyl,  Fukushima)  or  impacts 
from  refining  uranium  or  its  sources  (95%  is  imported  from  a  non-aligned  country  like  Russia) 
you  can  begin  to  identify  the  actual  full  costs  to  society  and  the  environment.  (0020-4-13  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  DEIS  should  conduct  a  form  of  a  life  cycle  analysis  since  NEPA  mandates  a 
"big  picture"  review  so  that  both  the  NRC  and  the  affected  public  can  make  the  best  decisions

possible  as  to  whether  investing  in  new  nuclear  power  plants  makes  sense  in  2014.  (0020-4-14 
[van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  In  the  draft  EIS,  the  NRC  has  examined  the  reasonably  foreseeable  impacts  from 
constructing  and  operating  a  reactor  at  the  proposed  ESP  site,  including  cumulative  impacts 
from  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions  and  impacts  of  energy 
alternatives.  Impacts  from  the  fuel  cycle  and  decommissioning  are  addressed  in  Chapters  6 
and  7  of  the  draft  EIS.  The  impacts  associated  with  the  risk  of  severe  accidents  are  analyzed  in 
Sections  5. 1 1  and  7.10  of  the  draft  EIS.  Impacts  of  energy  alternatives  are  discussed  in 
Sections  9.2  of  the  draft  EIS.  Issuance  of  the  ESP  does  not  authorize  construction  and 
operation  of  a  facility  at  the  site.  If  an  ESP  is  issued,  a  future  construction  permit  (CP)  or 
combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (combined  license  or  COL)  applicant 
referencing  it  would  still  need  to  consider  new  and  significant  information  relevant  to  the 
environmental  analysis.  The  NRC  would  consider  that  information  in  a  supplement  to  the  ESP 
EIS. 

The  environmental  impacts  of  decommissioning  along  with  the  NRC's  requirements  for 
decommissioning  are  discussed  in  draft  EIS  Section  6.3,  which  includes  discussion  regarding 
and  references  to  the  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  Decommissioning  of  Nuclear 
Facilities:  Supplement  1,  Regarding  the  Decommissioning  of  Nuclear  Power  Reactors  (GEIS- 
DECOM),  NUREG-0586,  Supplement  1.  As  explained  in  Section  6.3,  at  the  ESP  stage,  while 
applicants  for  a  CP  or  COL  referencing  an  ESP  are  required  to  provide  a  report  containing  a 
certification  that  financial  assurance  for  radiological  decommissioning  would  be  provided, 
applicants  are  not  required  to  submit  information  regarding  the  process  of  decommissioning  at 
the  ESP  stage.  However,  PSEG  did  provide  information  in  ER  Section  5. 9  concerning  the 
environmental  impacts  of  decommissioning  based  on  NUREG-0586,  Supplement  1,  and  a  2004 
DOE  report  focused  on  decommissioning  costs  for  advanced  reactors,  and  concluded  that  the 
environmental  impacts  of  decommissioning  discussed  in  NUREG-0586,  Supplement  1,  would 
be  the  same  as  those  for  advanced  reactor  designs  included  in  the  PSEG  ER  (i.e.,  API 000, 

U.S.  EPR,  ABWR,  and  US-APWR)  (PSEG  201 4-TN3452).  The  NRC  staffs  evaluation  of  the 
environmental  impacts  of  decommissioning  presented  in  the  GEIS-DECOM  identifies  a  range  of 
impacts  for  each  environmental  issue  for  a  range  of  different  reactor  designs.  The  staff  has  no 
reason  to  believe  that  the  impacts  discussed  in  the  GEIS-DECOM  are  not  bounding  for  reactors 
deployed  after  2002.  Based  on  the  GEIS-DECOM  and  the  staff's  evaluation  of  air-quality 
impacts  as  discussed  in  draft  EIS  in  Section  6.3,  the  NRC  staff  explained  its  conclusion  that,  as 
long  as  the  regulatory  requirements  on  decommissioning  activities  to  limit  the  impacts  of 
decommissioning  are  met,  decommissioning  activities  would  result  in  a  SMALL  impact. 

The  comm  enter  is  unclear  on  what  other  impacts  associated  with  the  fuel  cycle  have  not  been 
examined  in  Chapters  6  and  7.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were  made  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  And  I  would  like  to  ask  the  NRC,  and  the,  on  the  Corps  of  Engineers,  has  in  the 
history  of  your  agencies  together,  working  together,  have  they  ever  turned  down  a  nuclear  plant 
siting?  That  is  one  question.  (0007-3-6  [August,  Bernard]) 

Response:  The  PSEG  ESP  application  is  the  fifth  ESP  application  submitted  to  the  NRC  since 
the  regulations  in  10  CFR  52  established  the  requirements  for  ESPs.  The  NRC  determined 


NUREG-2168 


E-34 


November  2015 


Appendix  E 


after  conducting  its  detailed  technical  review  that  the  first  four  ESP  applications  met  the  NRC's 
rigorous  safety  and  environmental  reguirements.  Applicants  seeking  NRC  authorization  to 
construct  nuclear  power  facilities  have  withdrawn  their  applications  for  a  variety  of  reasons, 
including  where  they  were  unable  to  demonstrate  that  the  application  would  meet  the  NRC’s 
reguirements.  The  USACE  does  not  license  nuclear  power  plants.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  1-10;  Section  No.  1.1.7;  Line  No.  5-9;  The  ER  states  "The  final  SER  for 
the  PSEG  ESP  application  will  be  issued  following  publication  of  the  final  EIS.  The  NRC  staff 
anticipates  publication  of  the  final  SER  for  the  PSEG  ESP  application  after  the  issuance  of  the 
final  EIS."  (1 )  What  is  the  regulatory  basis  for  these  statements?  (2)  The  sentences  also  are 
contradictory  because  one  states  "will"  and  the  other  states  "anticipates";  suggest  deleting  the 
first  sentence  if  there  is  no  regulatory  basis  for  it.  (0015-1-7  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  text  in  the  EIS  has  been  revised  to  clarify  that  the  NRC  staff  anticipates 
publication  of  the  final  SER  for  the  PSEG  ESP  application  before  the  issuance  of  the  final  EIS. 
This  sentence  in  the  draft  EIS  was  intended  to  explain  the  order  in  which  the  staff  expected  to 
issue  its  two  review  documents  for  the  PSEG  ESP  application.  There  is  no  regulatory 
requirement  that  one  be  published  before  the  other. 

Comment:  Well  Drilling  Permits  for  construction  dewatering  wells,  permanent  water  supply 
wells  and  closure  of  abandoned  wells  will  be  required  from  the  Bureau  of  Water  Allocation  & 
Well  Permitting  (BWAWP).  (0021-6-6  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  commenter  is  correct,  and  the  applicant  will  be  required  to  obtain  Bureau  of 
Water  Allocation  &  Well  Permitting  permits  from  the  NJDEP.  Table  H-  7  in  Appendix  H  of  the 
EIS  has  a  list  of  permits  required,  which  includes  well  drilling  permits.  No  changes  were  made 
to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  4.0,  page  4-3,  para.  #3  and  Section  5.0,  page  5-1,  para.  #3:  the  NRC 
review  team  that  prepared  the  DEIS  assigned  impact  levels  of  "small",  "moderate"  or  "large"  to 
the  resource  areas  to  be  impacted  by  the  proposed  project.  These  "impact  category  levels  [are] 
based  on  the  assumption  [emphasis  added]  that  the  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the 
[PSEG  Environmental  Report]  or  activities  planned  by  various  State  and  county  governments  ... 
are  implemented.  Failure  to  implement  these  upgrades  might  result  in  a  change  in  the  impact 
category  level."  Thus,  the  actual  potential  impacts  of  the  proposed  project  have  not  been 
evaluated  in  the  DEIS  -this  is  a  fundamental  flaw  in  the  preparation  of  the  DEIS.  For  example, 
by  using  the  above-noted  procedure,  this  suggests  that  the  NRC  review  team  may  have 
underestimated  the  potential  impacts  of  the  proposed  project  to  in  the  following  sections  of  the 
DEIS:  (a)  Section  4. 3. 2. 2,  page  4-40:  states  "Mitigation  of  unavoidable  impacts  ...  may  include 
[emphasis  added]  restoration  of  habitats  ..."  (b)  Section  4. 3. 2. 2,  page  4-40-Upland  Terrestrial 
Impacts:  states  "The  mitigation  of  temporary  impacts  ...  could  include  [emphasis  added] 
restoration  ...  Mitigation  of  impacts  ...  may  include  [emphasis  added]  grading  and  planting  ... 
These  measures,  in  combination  could  restore  [emphasis  added]  quality  habitat  for  resident 
wildlife  populations."  (c)  Section  4. 3. 2. 3,  page  4-43,  para.  #1:  states  "Mitigation  of  wetland 
resources  may  be  [emphasis  added]  warranted."  (d)  Section  4. 3. 3. 4,  page  4-49:  states  "PSEG 
plans  to  consult  with  local,  State,  and  federal  agencies  regarding  additional  and  practicable

mitigation  needs  ..."  to  address  aquatic  impacts.  Thus,  since  these  mitigation  requirements 
were  not  known  by  the  NRC  review  team  when  preparing  the  DEIS,  how  could  they  be 
incorporated  into  its  assignment  of  an  impact  level?  (e)  Table  4-21 ,  page  4-108  -Terrestrial  and 
Wetland  Resources:  states  "Proposed  compensatory  actions  could  offset  some  of  the  impacts." 
(0021-4-6  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  EIS  describes  mitigation  measures  available  or  proposed  for  reducing  or 
avoiding  adverse  effects  by  resource  area.  The  NRC  staff  considers  mitigation  measures  in 
impact  determinations  for  resource  areas  in  the  EIS  when  those  mitigation  measures  are 
reasonably  foreseeable.  In  some  instances,  other  Federal  and  State  agencies  have  the 
regulatory  mechanisms  to  require  mitigation  commitments  with  respect  to  certain  environmental 
matters,  but  the  NRC  lacks  such  statutory  authority  when  mitigation  is  unrelated  to  radiological 
health  and  safety  matters.  Implementation  of  potential  mitigation  measures  listed  in  the  EIS  will 
be  at  the  discretion  of  the  applicant,  unless  required  to  satisfy  a  particular  permit.  The  USACE 
will  ensure  that  mitigation,  including  compensatory  mitigation,  required  for  any  Department  of 
the  Army  permit,  if  issued,  meets  its  program  requirements.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  E/S 
in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Some  of  the  impact  evaluations  conducted  in  the  DEIS  are,  in  part,  made  relative  to 
the  "quantity"  of  the  affected  resource  present  in  the  site  vicinity  or  in  the  surrounding  region  - 
since  the  impacts  resulting  from  the  proposed  PSEG  project  would  only  be  a  small  percentage 
of  this  larger  quantity,  the  impacts  are  considered  to  be  small  or  minor.  This  approach  -  taken  to 
the  extreme  and  applied  to  all  proposed  development  projects  or  human  activities  in  a  given 
region  -  would  lead  theoretically  to  imply  that  there  is  no/minimal  water  or  air  pollution,  habitat 
fragmentation,  threatened/endangered  species,  etc.  In  addition,  this  type  of  analysis  does  not 
consider  potential  threshold  effects  on  natural  resources  when  considering  if  the  level  of  impact 
could  "destabilize"  the  resource.  Thus,  it  is  not  appropriate  to  use  such  an  analysis  in  a  DEIS  to 
determine  the  magnitude  and  scope  of  potential  project  impacts.  [For  example,  see:  Forestland, 
page  4-26;  Water,  page  4-27;  Habitat  Loss  Impacts  -page  4-29;  Terrestrial  Species  of 
Recreational  or  Commercial  Value,  page  4-31;  Artificial  Ponds  and  Onsite  Marsh  Creeks,  page 
4-44;  7.1  -Land  Use,  page  7-8.]  (0021-4-7  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  commenter  is  concerned  about  the  use  of  a  defined  region  approach  to 
assessing  adverse  effects,  and  references  ecological  resources.  Each  resource  identified  and 
analyzed  in  the  EIS  defines  the  region  of  interest  ( ROI )  based  on  the  characteristics  that  define 
that  resource  in  terms  of  function  or  value.  The  impact  determinations  made  for  terrestrial  and 
aquatic  resources  in  the  EIS  were  dependent  upon  the  effects  to  the  function  of  these 
ecosystems  in  the  area,  and  not  based  on  acreage  or  linear  feet  of  creeks  alone.  In  addition, 
the  review  team  considered  cumulative  impacts  to  these  resources  in  Chapter  7  of  the  EIS. 
Moreover,  any  Department  of  the  Army  authorization  would  include  appropriate  mitigation  for  all 
impacts  to  these  types  of  resources.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  in  response  to  this 
comment. 

Comment:  The  USACE-Philadelphia  District  is  a  cooperating  agency  on  the  preparation  of  the 
EIS,  and  will  use  the  EIS  to  support  its  decision-making  process  for  regulated  activities  on  the 
PSEG  Artificial  Island  site  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of  new  nuclear  power 
generating  facilities.  The  USACE  issued  a  Public  Notice  to  this  effect,  to  which  ODST  has 


NUREG-2168 


E-36 


November  2015 


Appendix  E 


provided  comments  (letter  dated  September  30,  2014).  At  this  point,  given  that  the  proposed 
PSEG  project  is  "conceptual"  in  nature  and  the  scope  and  magnitude  of  potential  impacts  are  to 
be  further  clarified  in  the  future  after  the  "selected  alternative/design"  has  been  identified,  it 
appears  premature  for  the  USACE  to  make  any  regulatory  decisions  concerning  the  project. 
(0021-4-1  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  While  the  reactor  design  has  not  been  selected,  the  depths  and  locations  of  all 
proposed  dredging  have  been  identified  and  would  be  fully  evaluated  prior  to  the  issuance  of 
any  Department  of  the  Army  authorization.  Documentation  for  that  decision  would  be  included 
in  the  separate  USACE  decision  documents. 

E.2.3  Comments  Concerning  Site  Layout  and  Design 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-97;  Section  No.  2.4. 2. 2;  Line  No.  15-17;  This  section  states  "Three 
existing  transmission  lines  convey  power  from  SGS  and  HCGS.  The  existing  102  mi  of 
transmission  corridors  cross  Salem,  Gloucester,  and  Camden  Counties  in  New  Jersey,  and  New 
Castle  County  in  Delaware  (PSEG  2014-TN3452)."  Page  2-61 ,  Lines  4-6  state  "Four  existing 
500  kV  transmission  lines  extend  approximately  150  mi  offsite  in  support  of  HCGS  and  SGS. 
The  existing  transmission  lines  include  Hope  Creek-New  Freedom,  Salem-New  Freedom,  Hope 
Creek-Red  Lion,  and  Salem-New  Freedom  South."  These  statements  appear  to  be 
inconsistent.  (0015-1-19  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  text  in  the  EIS  has  been  revised  at  the  two  locations  mentioned  in  the 
comment  to  provide  clarification  and  to  eliminate  the  inconsistencies. 

Comment:  Page  No.  3-27;  Section  No.  3. 4. 2. 2;  Line  No.  33-36;  Replace  the  2nd  sentence  in 
this  paragraph  with:  "Safety-related  structures,  systems  and  components  (SSC)  for  the  new 
plant  will  be  designed  with  flood  protection  features  to  withstand  the  flood  height  of  the  DBF  and 
its  associated  effects."  per  the  revised  response  to  RAI  No.  67.  (See  ND-201 4-0020,  dated 
August  21,  2014).  (0015-2-10  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  3-27;  Section  No.  3. 4. 2. 2;  Line  No.  33;  In  accordance  with  the  revised 
response  to  RAI  No.  67,  the  design  basis  flood  elevation  for  the  new  plant  is  42.4  ft.  NAVD. 
(0015-2-9  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  In  response  to  these  comments,  the  text  in  the  EIS  has  been  revised  to  incorporate 
the  latest  information  on  flooding  as  presented  in  the  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report  (SSAR). 

Comment:  There  is  no  justified  need  for  a  new  three  lane  causeway  to  be  built  on 
environmentally  sensitive  deed  restricted  lands.  PSEG  proposes  to  construct  a  new  three  lane 
elevated  access  roadway,  but  there  is  no  explanation  as  to  why  the  current  three  lane  roadway 
is  inadequate  for  servicing  the  construction  and  operation  of  this  new  plant  especially  since  it 
was  sufficient  for  the  construction  of  three  other  nuclear  power  plants  on  the  same  site  (Section 
4.1.2.).  The  DEIS  does  not  discuss  who  will  be  ultimately  paying  for  the  construction  of  this 
expensive  roadway  and  what  will  happen  to  the  existing  three  lane  roadway.  (0020-4-7  [van

Response:  The  com  men  ter  expresses  concern  over  the  funding  of  the  proposed  causeway. 
NRC  does  not  address  how  an  applicant  funds  proposed  infrastructure.  However,  the  NRC  staff 
assesses  the  socioeconomic  and  transportation  effects  related  to  the  need,  construction,  and 
use  of  the  proposed  causeway  in  Chapters  4  and  5.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  3.4,  page  3-26:  maintenance  dredging  activities  needed  to  support  the 
operation  of  the  proposed  project  are  only  briefly  discussed  and  evaluated  in  the  DEIS. 

(0021-4-11  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  discussion  of  maintenance  dredging  in  Chapter  3  is  descriptive  and  does  not 
address  impacts.  The  potential  impacts  of  maintenance  dredging  are  discussed  in  Section 
5.3.2.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  path  of  the  causeway  transects  a  mitigation  area  that  is  included  in  the  Estuary 
Enhancement  Program  (EEP),  as  well  as  two  wildlife  management  areas.  The  DEIS  does  not 
address  any  possible  alternate  routes  that  were  considered  or  how  the  route  presented  was 
chosen.  The  final  EIS  should  provide  background  on  alternatives  presented  and  the  justification 
for  the  selected  route.  (0023-1-17  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  proposed  causeway  route  was  one  of  four  alternatives  evaluated  in  the  Traffic 
Impact  Analysis  study  (PSEG  201 3-TN2525).  The  causeway  route  was  determined  to  have  the 
least  impacts  of  the  four  alternatives  evaluated.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result 
of  this  comment. 

E.2.4  Comments  Concerning  Land  Use-Site  and  Vicinity 

Comment:  I  would  expect  that  the  enhancement  program,  that  they  are  talking  about,  if  it  is 
done  on  state  property,  which  would  be  a  first,  because  right  now  that  has  not  been  done,  it  has 
always  been  done  on  private  property.  (0006-7-6  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Comment:  They  wanted  to  put  an  upland  dike  around  that  area  to  protect  the  roads  within 
Ellsinboro  Township.  The  Division  was  unable  to  do  that  for  lack  of  funding.  PSEG  has  taken 
that  basic  plan  and  enhanced  it.  And  if  they  are  able  to  do  this,  it  will  be  a  benefit  to  the 
township,  it  will  stop  some  of  the  flooding  that  goes  on  now,  on  Mason  Point  Road,  and  Abbot's 
Farm  Road,  and  it  will  allow  the  township  to  maintain  their  infrastructure  at  a  much  lower  cost. 
(0006-7-8  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  PSEG's  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  (EEP)  in  Section 
2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  existing  environment.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  In  addition  to  the  storm  surge  we  are  -  we  continue  to  be  concerned  about 
wetlands.  You  know,  there  is  a  trade,  kind  of  a  sweetheart  swapping  deal  being  proposed,  with 
some  Corps  lands.  I  bet  guessed  on  appraised  value.  But  we  knew,  from  federal  actions  here 
in  Delaware,  that  beyond  the  value,  the  land  values  of  wetlands,  we  put  a  higher  premium  on 
them.  We  are  spending  40  million  dollars  to  try  to  restore  and  protect  100  acres  of  wetlands  in

values  on  this  type  of  wetlands.  (0007-2-11  [Carter,  David]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  existing  wetlands  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS,  and  potential 
impacts  to  wetlands  in  Sections  4.3. 1  and  5.3.1.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result 
of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  xxiii;  Section  "Evaluation  of  Impacts";  Line  No.  5-10;  Lines  5-7  state  that 
the  cumulative  impacts  on  land  use  and  several  other  resource  areas  would  be  MODERATE. 
Lines  8-10  state  "However,  the  contributions  of  impacts  from  the  NRC-authorized  activities 
would  be  SMALL  for  all  of  the  above-listed  resource  areas,  except  for  physical  impacts  and 
infrastructure  and  community  services  impacts."  This  implies  that  the  land  use  impacts  of  NRC- 
authorized  activities  would  be  SMALL  and  would  not  contribute  to  the  MODERATE  cumulative 
land  use  impact.  However,  lines  21  and  22  on  page  4-8  state  "the  NRC  staff  concludes  that  the 
land-use  impacts  of  the  NRC-authorized  construction  would  also  be  MODERATE."  Lines  3-5  on 
page  7-10  say  "the  incremental  contribution  to  cumulative  land-use  impacts  of  NRC-authorized 
activities  would  contribute  to  the  overall  [MODERATE]  impact ...."  It  appears  that  land  use 
impacts  should  be  clarified  in  the  discussion  on  page  xxiii.  (0015-1-3  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  subject  text  (Executive  Summary,  draft  EIS  page  xxiii,  Lines  8-10)  has  been 
revised  in  the  EIS  to  indicate  that  the  land-use  impacts  of  NRC-authorized  activities  would 
contribute  to  MODERA  TE  cumulative  land-use  impacts. 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-6;  Section  No.  2.2.1;  Line  No.  7-10;  This  sentence  implies  that  the 
dominant  land  uses  on  the  existing  PSEG  Site  are  former  construction  support  areas  rather  than 
current  developed  facilities.  Suggest  revising  the  sentence  to  read,  "Dominant  land  uses  on  the 
existing  PSEG  property  are  industrial  lands  that  currently  house  the  SGS  and  HCGS  facilities  or 
wetlands  that..."  (0015-1-8  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-7;  Section  No.  4.1.1;  Line  No.  2;  The  acreage  given  in  the  text  for 
wetland  impacts  does  not  match  that  in  DEIS  Table  4-1.  According  to  the  table,  32  acres  of 
wetlands  plus  3  acres  of  managed  wetlands  for  35  total  wetlands  would  be  temporarily 
disturbed,  (which  would  total  the  160  stated).  (0015-2-12  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  text  in  the  EIS  has  been  revised  as  recommended  in  these  comments. 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-6;  Section  No.  4.1.1;  Figure  4-1;  Change  the  title  of  Figure  4-1  from: 
"Land  Use/Land  Cover  Impacted  by  Preconstruction  and  Construction  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  in 
the  Vicinity."  to  "Land  Use/Land  Cover  Impacted  by  Preconstruction  and  Construction  at  the 
PSEG  Site".  The  figure  only  depicts  the  LULC  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  does  not  include  the 
vicinity.  (0015-2-11  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  caption  for  Figure  4- 1  has  been  revised  in  the  EIS  as  suggested  in  this 
comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-8;  Section  No.  4.1.1;  Line  No.  17-19;  The  DEIS  states:  "...  the 
combined  land-use  impacts  of  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  on  the  PSEG  Site

would  be  MODERATE,  primarily  because  of  the  USACE  loss  of  dredge  spoil  disposal  capacity 
at  the  Artificial  Island  CDF."  Section  1.1.3,  page  1-6,  defines  MODERATE  as  "Environmental 
effects  are  sufficient  to  alter  noticeably,  but  not  to  destabilize,  important  attributes  of  the 
resource."  What  environmentally  important  attributes  are  noticeably  altered  by  the  loss  of 
USACE  dredge  disposal  capacity  at  Al?  (0015-2-13  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-8;  Section  No.  4.1.1;  Line  No.  16-22;  Similarly,  the  DEIS  concludes  that 
the  land-use  impacts  to  the  site  and  vicinity  are  MODERATE,  "primarily  because  of  the  USACE 
loss  of  dredge  spoil  disposal  capacity  at  the  Artificial  Island  CDF."  PSEG  recommends  that  the 
impact  level  be  changed  to  SMALL  for  the  reasons  discussed  in  the  Environmental  Report  and 
because  any  loss  of  dredge  spoil  disposal  capacity  at  the  Artificial  Island  CDF  would  be 
replaced  with  separate  dredge  spoil  disposal  capacity  as  part  of  a  land  swap.  Please  make 
conforming  changes  throughout  the  DEIS.  (0015-2-14  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  In  the  case  of  land  use  on  the  PSEG  Site,  the  "important  attributes  of  the  resource" 
that  would  be  noticeably  altered  would  be  the  undeveloped  CDF  (which  would  be  permanently 
altered  to  create  a  heavily  developed  industrial  area).  The  existing  land  use  (i.e.,  undeveloped 
dredge  disposal  facility)  is  important  because  of  the  function  it  serves  for  the  USACE,  not 
because  it  is  environmentally  pristine.  This  importance  is  highlighted  by  the  fact  that  the 
USACE  would  need  to  acquire  additional  dredge  disposal  capacity  elsewhere  in  the  region  if  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  is  constructed  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Replacing  the  existing  CDF  location 
with  another  CDF  would  be  noticeable;  however,  a  separate  CDF  has  been  identified,  and  the 
loss  of  the  CDF  on  Artificial  Island  would  not  destabilize  the  resource.  No  changes  have  been 
made  to  the  FIS  in  response  to  these  comments,  and  the  impact  level  remains  MODERA  TE. 

Comment:  Page  No.  J-4;  Land  Use;  4th  item:  Change  to  "  ...  Deeds  of  Conservation 
Restriction  along  the  proposed  causeway."  Releases  on  the  lands  "at  alternative  sites  4-1,  7-1, 
and  7-3"  are  not  required  because  PSEG  has  no  intention  of  developing  these  sites.  The 
reference  to  the  alternative  sites  should  be  deleted.  (0015-7-17  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  Table  J-2  has  been  modified  as  suggested  by  the  commenter. 

Comment:  From  the  information  in  the  DEIS,  it  appears  that  PSEG  proposes  to  construct 
portions  of  the  project,  including  the  causeway,  on  lands  owned  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and 
protected  by  deed  restrictions.  We  do  not  support  the  diversion  of  State-owned  wildlife 
management  areas  for  development  activities.  These  areas  are  protected  and  managed  due  to 
their  high  ecological  value.  Wetlands  fill  and  other  construction  activities  on  these  protected 
areas  can  affect  the  entire  wildlife  management  area  adversely  due  to  habitat  loss,  hydrologic 
modifications,  and  increases  in  human  activity  and  storm  water  runoff.  (0018-1-5  [Chiarella, 

Louis]) 

Comment:  This  proposed  causeway  will  be  five  miles  long  and  will  permanently  impact  at  least 
45  acres  of  wetlands  on  deed  restricted  land.  Virtually  all  of  the  roadway  traverses  either 
enhanced  wetlands  or  wildlife  management  areas  and  will  require  deed  restriction  releases  from 
the  State  of  New  Jersey.  In  fact,  one  of  these  areas  is  property  that  PSEG  previously 
purchased  as  compensation  for  other  properties  that  it  damaged  as  part  of  previous 
construction.  (0020-4-8  [van  Rossum,  Maya])

Appendix  E 


Response :  The  EIS  addresses  the  impacts  of  developing  lands  protected  by  Deeds  of 
Conservation  Restriction  in  Sections  4.1.2,  9.3.2. 1,  and  9.3.5. 1.  No  changes  were  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  This  lack  of  [property]  ownership  fact  bas  been  confirmed  through  Public  Notice 
(CENAP-OP-R-20090157)  for  a  404  permit  by  USACE.  In  that  application,  PSEG  was  not  able 
to  state  that  the  "applicant  possesses  or  will  possess  the  requisite  property  interest  to  undertake 
the  activity."  PSEG  cannot  demonstrate  this  prerequisite  requirement  for  permit  application 
completeness,  since  it  does  not  own  or  currently  have  legal  authority  to  undertake  the  proposed 
activities  listed  in  the  draft  permit.  Based  upon  a  different  Public  Notice  (CENAP-PL-E-14-01 , 
dated  July  15,  2014),  the  USACE  has  confirmed  that  PSEG  is  not  at  this  time  the  owner  of  the 
property  proposed  for  this  404  permit.  USACE  is  the  present  owner  of  this  property.  While  that 
Public  Notice  proposes  some  form  of  land  swap  by  the  USACE  to  PSEG,  there  is  no  level  of 
certainty  that  this  will  occur,  especially  since  even  if  the  USACE  agrees  to  a  trade,  there  could 
be  additional  legal  obstacles  or  actions  to  challenge  it  or  invalidate  it.  (0020-1-17  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Response:  The  commenter  expresses  concern  regarding  the  current  status  of  the  CDF  land 
swap.  A  separate  action  is  underway  between  USACE  and  the  applicant  to  address  the  transfer 
of  the  requisite  real  estate  interest.  The  applicant  is  required  to  have  the  requisite  property 
interest  and/or  authority  to  undertake  the  proposed  activity  before  any  work  may  occur. 

However,  the  EIS  evaluates  the  effects  of  the  proposed  activity  including  the  proposed  land 
exchange  in  order  to  fully  consider  reasonably  foreseeable  environmental  impacts,  consistent 
with  NEPA.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  On  the  existing  PSEG  owned  site  (total  of  819.1  acres  representing  all  land  use 
categories)  225.4  acres  will  have  a  permanent  land  use  change.  From  the  information 
presented  in  Table  4-1  it  is  unclear  what  the  permanent  land  use  changes  will  be,  although  it  is 
expected  that  much  of  the  change  will  result  in  an  overall  increase  in  urban  or  built-up  land. 
(0023-1-10  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  As  stated  in  EIS  Section  4.1.1,  "225  ac  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  permanently 
disturbed  to  support  developed  or  industrial  land  uses  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant.  ”  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  It  is  also  expected  that  there  will  be  a  permanent  loss  of  8.7  acres  of  Forestland: 
42.3  acres  of  Water;  1 08  acres  of  Wetlands;  and  18.8  acres  of  Barren  land.  In  addition,  on  the 
existing  PSEG  site  it  is  anticipated  that  there  will  be  a  temporary  loss,  perhaps  as  long  as  8 
years  during  the  preconstruction/site  mobilization  and  construction  periods  of  80.3  acres  of 
Forestland  and  31 .8  acres  of  Wetlands.  On  the  Adjacent  Offsite  Area,  located  in  the  USACE 
Artificial  Island  Confined  Disposal  Facility,  there  will  be  a  temporary,  again  perhaps  as  long  as  8 
years,  disturbance  of  30.2  acres  of  Wetlands  and  12.5  acres  of  Barren  Land.  Mitigation  for 
temporary  as  well  as  permanent  impacts  should  be  considered  and  discussed  in  the  final  EIS 
given  the  potential  for  long  lasting  impacts  from  the  proposed  "temporary"  impacts.  Forest 
impacts  are  of  particular  concern  here  as  impacted  forest  land  will  take  a  relatively  long  time  to 
re-establish.  (0023-1-11  [Cooksey,  Sarah])

Appendix  E 


Response:  The  commenter  expresses  concerns  about  temporary  and  permanent  loss  of 
habitats.  Temporary  and  permanent  habitat  impacts  from  site-preparation  and  construction 
activities  are  addressed  in  EIS  Sections  4.3. 1  and  4.3.2,  to  include  mitigation,  in  addition,  the 
USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  unavoidable  impacts. 
That  process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a  statement 
of  findings  addressing  public  interest.  It  will  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Clean  Water  Act 
(CWA)  Section  404(b)(1)  guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this 
comment. 

Comment:  The  potential  impacts  of  PSEG  permanently  and  temporarily  using  land  associated 
with  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  on  the  present  and  future  dredged  material 
disposal  capacity  available  to  the  USACE  for  deepening  and  maintenance  dredging  activities 
have  not  been  evaluated  in  the  DEIS.  If  the  acquisition/use  of  this  land  by  PSEG  will  result  in 
the  need  for  the  USACE  to  develop  additional  upland  CDFs  to  meet  its  dredged  material 
disposal  needs,  this  cumulative  impact  of  the  proposed  PSEG  project  must  also  be  evaluated  in 
the  DEIS.  Likewise,  the  potential  impacts  of  construction  activities  associated  with  the  proposed 
PSEG  project  on  the  present  use  and  operation  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  must 
be  evaluated  in  the  DEIS.  (0021-4-3  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Sections  4. 1  and  7. 1  in  the  EIS  address  the  impacts  of  the  CDF  land  exchange  in 
regard  to  construction  and  cumulative  effects,  respectively.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS 
as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  If  an  additional  on-site  or  off-site  upland  CDF  is  needed  to  manage  the  dredged 
material  from  the  proposed  PSEG  project  (construction  and  operation/maintenance),  the 
impacts  of  the  construction  and  operation  of  this  facility  should  be  evaluated  in  the  DEIS.  (0021- 
4-15  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  PSEG  has  not  proposed  to  construct  an  additional  onsite  or  offsite  CDF  to  manage 
the  material  that  would  be  dredged  for  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant,  and  the 
USACE  has  not  commented  that  an  additional  CDF  would  be  needed  for  this  purpose.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Many  of  the  construction-related  impacts  are  noted  as  "temporary"  in  duration. 
However,  construction  activities  will  occur  over  an  estimated  time  period  of  7  years  (see  Table 
3-2,  page  3-20).  (0021-5-1  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  term  " temporary "  is  used  to  describe  those  impacts  or  changes  that  would  not 
be  permanent.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  p.  2-12,  lines  15-22[;  page  4-7,  lines  21-27;  page  4-10,  lines  24-26]:  "Coastal  Zone

Determination  has  not  been  issued  for  the  project  before  the  NRC  and  the  Corps.  The  Federal 
Consistency  was  conditioned  on  the  applicant  receiving  the  required  permits  named  above. 

Once  those  approvals  are  obtained,  the  project  will  be  considered  consistent  with  the  Coastal 
Zone  Management  Act.  (0021-5-5  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Draft  EIS  Sections  2. 7  (page  2-  7 2,  lines  19-22)  and  4. 7  (page  4-7,  lines  24-27) 
explicitly  identify  the  NJDEP  condition  referenced  in  this  comment:  "As  proposed,  the  project  will 
require  a  CAFRA  [Coastal  Area  Facility  Review  Act]  Individual  Permit,  Coastal  Wetlands  Permit, 
Waterfront  Development  Permit,  and  Freshwater  Wetlands  Individual  Permit  from  the  Division. 
These  permits  must  be  obtained  prior  to  any  construction  activities  on  the  site  related  to  the 
project  described  above. "  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  In  order  to  construct  the  proposed  nuclear  power  generating  facilities,  the  USACE 
will  have  to  permanently  transfer  85  acres  of  its  existing  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  to  PSEG. 

In  exchange,  PSEG  and  USACE  have  proposed  a  land  exchange,  and  that  PSEG  will  obtain  all 
the  permits  needed  to  construct  and  operate  -and  will  construct  -a  new  upland  CDF  at  Site  15G 
along  the  Delaware  River.  This  land  exchange  is  the  subject  of  a  Draft  Environmental 
Assessment  (DEA)  prepared  by  the  USACE,  which  the  Department  has  commented  on  (letter 
from  Ruth  Foster  dated  August  27,  2014).  However,  the  actual  acres  of  land  to  be  exchanged 
and  their  relationship  to  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  vary  between  the  DEIS  and  the 
Land  Exchange  DEA:  (a)  Section  2.2.1,  page  2-5,  para.  #2:  states  that  PSEG  will  acquire  85 
acres  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF.  However,  the  land  exchange  evaluated  in  the 
DEA  includes  the  transfer  of  631  acres  of  federally-owned  land  to  PSEG-94  acres  comprising 
Cell  3  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF,  and  537  acres  of  adjacent  wetlands  (to  be 
used  as  a  "buffer  area").  The  ESP  DEIS  and  Land  Exchange  DEA  must  be  consistent  with 
each  other,  (b)  Section  2.2.1,  page  2-5,  para.  #2:  states  that  PSEG  will  temporarily  lease  an 
additional  45  acres  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF-but  also  states  "PSEG  would 
return  the  45  ac  of  leased  land  to  the  USACE,  subject  to  any  required  long-term  exclusion  area 
boundary  (EAB)  control  conditions  from  the  NRC."  Thus,  potentially  130  acres  of  the  USACE 
Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  could  be  transferred  to  PSEG.  The  acreage  transferred  must  be 
verified  to  evaluate  the  potential  impacts  of  the  proposed  project  on  the  operation  of  the  USACE 
Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  and  its  future  capacity  to  meet  the  maintenance  dredging  needs  of 
the  USACE.  [Also  see  Section  2.12,  page  2-193  Proposed  Land  Exchange  Between  USACE 
and  PSEG.]  (c)  Section  2.2.1,  page  2-6,  para.  #2:  states  that  the  85  acres  to  be  pernl  anently 
acquired  from  the  USACE  consists  of  50  acres  that  arc  part  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island 
Upland  CDF  and  35  acres  of  an  adjacent  coastal  marsh,  (d)  Table  2-1 ,  page  2-9:  associated 
with  the  "85-Ac  Parcel  to  be  Acquired"  are  28.3  acres  of  Phragmites-dominated  Coastal 
Wetlands  and  0.2  acres  Saline  Marsh  not  35  acres  of  adjacent  coastal  marsh.  (0021-4-2  [Foster, 
Ruth]) 

Response:  The  commenter  asks  for  clarification  concerning  the  acreage  detailed  in  a  draft 
Environmental  Assessment  (EA)  prepared  by  USACE  and  the  text  in  the  EIS  that  describes 
acreage  related  to  the  land  swap  for  the  CDF.  The  land  exchange  between  PSEG  and  USACE 
is  a  separate  action  that  would  occur  without  PSEG's  application  for  an  ESP.  An  independent 
EA  is  being  prepared  by  USACE  for  that  action.  The  EIS  evaluates  the  loss  of  the  USACE 
Artificial  Island  CDF  as  part  of  cumulative  impacts  in  Chapter  7.  No  changes  were  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment

Comment:  To  quantitatively  verify  that  the  remaining  portions  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island 
Upland  CDF  will  have  adequate  capacity  to  meet  the  dredged  material  disposal  needs  of  the 
USACE,  the  DEIS  should  (1)  calculate  the  available  dredged  material  disposal  capacity 
considering  the  transfer  of  both  85  acres  and  1 30  acres  of  the  facility  to  PSEG,  and  (2)  compare 
that  to  estimates  of  the  USACE  maintenance  dredged  material  disposal  needs  over  the  next  50 
years  for  the  reaches  of  the  Delaware  River  that  the  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  serves.  (0021- 
4-4  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Dredge  disposal  needs  of  the  USACE  are  determined  by  that  agency.  An 
independent  EA  is  being  prepared  by  USACE  for  the  land  exchange  with  PSEG  that  will 
address  these  long-term  dredge  disposal  needs.  Section  7. 7  of  the  EIS  addresses  cumulative 
land-use  impacts  including  those  impacts  of  the  land  exchange.  No  changes  were  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  4.1.1,  page  4-8,  para.  #1 :  states  "The  Artificial  Island  CDF  provides  the 
USACE  with  dredge  spoil  disposal  capacity  .  .  .  the  USACE  would  need  to  replace  some  or  all 
of  this  disposal  capacity  by  using  an  existing  CDF  or  developing  a  new  CDF  at  another 
location."  Thus,  the  DEIS  concludes  that  the  proposed  project  would  have  "moderate"  impacts 
on  land-use.  However,  since  the  potential  impacts  of  the  proposed  project  on  the  operation  of 
the  USACE  Artificial  Island  Upland  CDF  and  the  potential  need  to  construct  and  operate  a  new 
upland  CDF  have  not  been  evaluated  in  the  DEIS,  it  does  not  appear  possible  to 
comprehensively  evaluate  the  potential  land  use  impacts  of  the  proposed  project.  [Also  see 
Table  4-21,  page  4-105-Site  and  Vicinity.]  (0021-4-5  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  An  evaluation  of  the  USACE  Artificial  Island  CDF  land  use  is  presented  in  EIS 
Sections  4. 7  and  5.1.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Throughout  [Sections  2.0  and  4.0],  the  NRC  describes  the  acreages  of  the  various 
habitats  that  would  be  affected  by  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  generating 
station  at  the  PSEG  site.  However,  the  numbers  appear  inconsistent  and  seem  to  vary  from 
section  to  section  even  when  describing  the  same  impact  to  the  same  habitat.  In  addition,  the 
impacts  also  appear  different  from  those  described  in  the  Public  Notice  (CENAP-OP-R-2009- 
0157)  issued  by  the  USACE  for  this  project.  The  final  EIS  should  clearly  and  concisely  identify 
all  of  the  temporary  and  permanent  impacts  to  all  habitat  types  and  clearly  define  the  habitat 
types  (i.e. ,  estuarine  wetlands,  freshwater  tidal  wetlands,  freshwater  non-tidal,  etc.).  (0018-1-3 
[Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  The  acreage  numbers  cited  in  various  sections  of  the  draft  EIS  may  appear 
inconsistent  because  of  the  numerous  classifications  discussed  for  various  habitat  types.  For 
example,  in  addition  to  the  generic  "wetland, "  the  draft  EIS  discusses  several  types  of  wetland 
habitats  (e.g.,  saline  marsh,  Phragmites-dominated  coastal  wetlands,  deciduous  scrub/shrub 
wetlands,  herbaceous  wetlands,  and  Phragmites-dominated  interior  wetlands);  hence,  the 
"i wetland "  acreages  discussed  vary  among  draft  EIS  sections  according  to  the  specific  wetland 
types  being  discussed.  Other  commenters  have  noted  some  specific  inconsistencies  in 
acreages  (e.g.,  on  draft  EIS  4-7,  Line  2),  and  the  text  in  the  EIS  was  revised  to  address  those 
inconsistencies.  However,  none  of  these  revisions  affects  the  conclusions  regarding  the  levels

of  impact  during  construction  for  either  the  land -use  or  terrestrial  ecology  resource  categories, 
both  of  which  remain  MODERA  TE,  as  discussed  in  Section  4. 7  7. 

Regarding  the  comment  that " the  impacts  also  appear  different  from  those  described  in  the 
Public  Notice  (CENAP-OP-R-2009-01 57)  issued  by  the  USACE  for  this  project,  "the  impact 
conclusions  described  in  the  draft  EIS  are  based  on  information  provided  by  the  applicant  to  the 
NRC  in  the  ESP  application  and  in  response  to  the  NRC  staff's  reguests  for  additional 
information.  Because  the  USACE  and  the  NRC  have  different  permitting  responsibilities  with 
regard  to  the  proposed  action,  it  is  possible  that  the  applicant  may  have  submitted  different 
acreage  information  in  the  Department  of  the  Army  permit  application  than  in  the  NRC  ESP 
application  due  to  the  different  requirements  for  those  two  separate  permits.  In  addition,  the 
USACE  utilizes  the  Cowardin  System  for  land-use  classification  of  wetlands  and  waters,  the 
overall  acreages  of  impacts  described  according  to  NJDEP  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC) 
classification  system  would  be  similar,  but  may  not  be  identical,  to  the  acreage  calculations  for 
the  USACE  values.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  habitat  condition  and  extent  of  wetlands 
may  vary  with  time,  especially  in  modified  or  disturbed  locations  (e.g.,  CDFs)  where  dredge 
materials  are  being  deposited.  The  USACE  has  prepared  and  approved jurisdictional 
determination  for  the  project  site  (USACE  2014-TN3282).  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as 
a  result  of  this  comment. 

E.2.5  Comments  Concerning  Land  Use-Transmission  Lines 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-18;  Section  No.  2. 2. 2.1;  Line  No.  25;  Change  "Salem-New  Freedom: 
extends  northeast  from  SGS  for  39  mi  in  a  350-ft-wide  corridor ..."  to  "Salem-New  Freedom: 
extends  northeast  from  SGS  for  50  mi  in  a  350-ft-wide  corridor ..."  as  stated  In  ER  Section 
2.2.3. 1.  (0015-1-9  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  7-8;  Section  No.  7.1;  Line  No.  13;  Before  the  word  "stability"  insert  the 
word  "grid"  in  order  to  distinguish  grid  stability  from  the  stability  of  the  Artificial  Island  which  is 
discussed  elsewhere  in  the  DEIS.  (0015-4-8  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  text  in  the  EIS  has  been  revised  as  suggested  in  these  comments. 

Comment:  Transmission  lines  have  a  great  impact  on  the  hand  which  they  cross.  PSEG 
currently  has  a  network  of  long  distance  high  voltage  transmission  lines  that  emanate  from  both 
Salem  and  Hope  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Stations.  These  transmission  lines  consume  huge 
acreage,  fragment  forests,  and  prevent  any  use  of  the  land  below  it,  other  than  farming  or 
grassland.  These  transmission  lines  have  a  huge  cumulative  impact  on  the  State  and 
demonstrate  that  locating  this  plant  far  from  the  users  of  this  electricity  creates  a  need  to 
permanently  disrupt  thousands  of  acres  of  otherwise  usable  lands  across  the  State  in  order  to 
deliver  the  power  to  the  population  centers  in  northern  New  Jersey.  (0020-4-17  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Response:  As  the  draft  EIS  explains  in  Section  3. 2. 2. 2,  the  existing  transmission  lines 
servicing  the  HCGS/SGS  site  have  adequate  thermal  capacity  to  accommodate  the  additional 
generation  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Independent  of  this  project,  PJM 
is  evaluating  grid  improvements  to  address  congestion  and  grid  stability  to  determine  future

development  of  transmission  tines.  Thus,  potential  future  transmission  line  development  has 
independent  utility  with  or  without  additional  power  generation  from  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  ESP  does  not  authorize  any  construction  or  preconstruction  activities  at  the  PS  EG  Site,  nor 
does  it  obligate  an  applicant  to  undertake  any  preconstruction  work,  much  of  which  would  not 
require  an  NRC  license.  Nevertheless,  the  draft  EIS  discusses  the  cumulative  environmental 
impacts  to  transmission  line  corridors  in  Chapter  7. 

No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

E.2.6  Comments  Concerning  Geology 

Comment:  p.  2-169,  lines  31-33.  The  EIS  indicates  the  Coastal  Plain  sediments  form  a  wedge 
that  ranges  from  a  feather  edge  at  the  Fall  Line  to  19,685  feet  at  the  coast  near  Cape  May. 
Comment:  Basement  (crystalline  bedrock)  was  penetrated  in  the  Anchor  Dickinson  gas  well 
about  2.5  miles  from  the  coast  at  Cape  May  Point  at  a  depth  of  6,357  feet,  nowhere  near  the 
19,000  feet  cited  online  32.  (0021-1-19  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  thickness  of  the  coastal  plain  sediments  is  approximately  6, 000  feet  in  Cape 
May  County,  as  stated  in  EIS  Section  2.3. 1.2.  Section  2.8  of  the  EIS  was  corrected  to  be 
consistent  with  this  earlier  section. 

Comment:  p.  2-169,  lines  35-37  and  p.  2-170,  Figure  2-30  (Stratigraphic  Section  of  the  PSEG 
Site).  The  EIS  indicates  that  Figure  2-30  is  the  stratigraphic  section  for  the  PSEG  site  (see 
comment  below).  Comment:  It  is  stated  that  this  figure  depicts  the  stratigraphic  section  for  the 
site.  The  upper  part  of  the  section  shown  consists  of  Quaternary  Marsh  deposits,  Cape  May 
Formation,  Kirkwood  Formation,  Shark  River  Formation,  Manasquan  Formation,  Vincentown 
Formation,  and  Hornerstown  Formation  for  the  Cenozoic.  Of  the  those  units  listed  as  being  at 
the  site,  neither  the  Kirkwood,  Shark  River  or  Manasquan  Formations  are  present  under 
Artificial  Island.  The  figure  also  shows  the  Hornerstown  in  both  Cenozoic  and  Mesozoic  Eras. 
The  base  of  the  Hornerstown  is  Paleocene,  not  Cretaceous  so  it  does  not  cross  into  the 
Mesozoic  Era.  (0021-2-1  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Figure  2-30  included  in  the  draft  EIS  is  PSEG  SSAR  Figure  2.5. 1-33,  which 
represents  geologic  units  from  a  larger  area  than  the  proposed  site  itself,  instead  of  SSAR 
Figure  2.5. 1-34,  which  represents  the  local  stratigraphy.  A  corrected  figure  of  local  stratigraphy 
was  included  in  the  EIS  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  p.  2-171,  lines  27-29.  The  report  indicates  that  Neogene  strata  (upper  Tertiary) 
encountered  at  the  PSEG  site  during  the  geotechnical  investigation  is  composed  of  the 
Kirkwood  Formation  and  it  is  divided  into  upper  and  lower  units.  Comment:  As  indicated  above 
(comments  for  p.  2-39),  there  is  no  Kirkwood  at  the  site,  even  though  PSEG  and  their 
consultants  still  call  the  shallow  clays  at  the  site  the  Kirkwood  Formation.  The  clays  below  the 
alluvium  and  above  the  Vincentown  are  Pleistocene,  not  Miocene,  an  age  difference  of  about  19 
million  years.  They  were  exposed  during  the  construction  of  the  Salem  reactors  and  examined 
and  photographed  by  geologists  from  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  with  a  report  being  published 
in  1979.  Both  PSEG  and  NRC  should  accept  modern  geologic  mapping  and  not  use  mapping

done  prc-1910.  All  modern  geologic  mapping  of  the  area  published  since  the  Geologic  Map  of 
New  Jersey,  1910-1912,  indicates  the  Kirkwood  is  not  present  under  Artificial  Island.  Owens 
and  others  (1998)  shows  the  lower  contact  of  the  Kirkwood  orientated  almost  north-south  to  the 
cast  of  the  plant  indicating  the  Kirkwood  has  been  eroded  out  under  the  plant  site.  The  fact  that 
the  Kirkwood  Formation  is  not  present  at  the  site  and  that  the  shallow  Pleistocene  clays 
between  the  alluvium  and  the  Vincentown  are  not  continuous  running  from  the  river  inland  under 
Salem  County  to  the  cast  and  northeast  of  the  plant  should  be  accepted  by  NRC.  (0021-2-2 
[Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  p.  3-20  Table  3-2.  Comment:  The  table  indicates  "Excavate  to  Kirkwood  Formation 
(both  units)."  This  should  be  revised  to  "Excavate  to  the  Pleistocene  clay  and  sand  unit"  since 
there  is  no  Kirkwood  Formation  present  on  Artificial  Island.  The  material  they  call  Kirkwood  is 
Pleistocene  in  age  and  is  mapped  as  the  Cape  May  Formation  (Stanford,  20  II).  Cross  section 
A-A'  depicts  the  geology  from  river  across  the  plant  site  to  the  eastern  edge  of  quadrangle.  Also 
see  Owens  and  Minard  (1979).  (0021-2-3  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  p.  3-21,  lines  41-42.  The  report  indicates  the  preconstruction  excavation  would  go 
down  to  about  50  feet  to  the  Kirkwood.  Comment:  There  is  no  Kirkwood  present  on  Artificial 
Island.  It  should  be  down  to  the  "Pleistocene  clay  unit".  (0021-2-4  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  reviewed  the  reports  and  maps  cited  in  this  and  other  comments 
related  to  the  interpretation  of  the  sediments  at  the  PS  EG  Site  located  above  the  Vincentown 
Formation.  The  NRC  staff  agrees  that  these  reports  and  maps  are  consistent  with  this 
comment.  The  relevant  sections  of  the  EIS  have  been  changed  to  be  consistent  with  the 
interpretation  of  these  sediments  as  reflected  in  the  reports  and  maps  reviewed  by  the  NRC 
staff. 

E.2.7  Comments  Concerning  Surface  Water  Hydrology 

Comment:  The  Water  Resources  Association  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  (WRA)  is  interested 
in  PSEG's  proposed  project,  because  PSEG’s  proposed  nuclear  plant  will  be  a  major  water 
user,  located  in  the  Delaware  River  basin,  and  is  an  important  part  of  the  economy  in  New 
Jersey,  and  the  region  at  large.  (0004-16-1  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  In  reviewing  the  PSEG  ESP  application,  and  Environmental  Report  filed  on  May 
25th,  2010,  we  noted  that  the  new  unit's  intake  and  cooling  system  will  be  designed  to  minimize 
the  impact  to  the  aquatic  community  by  utilizing  cooling  towers,  and  an  intake  system  with 
design  flows  that  conform  to  best  available  technology,  as  required  by  Section  316(b)  of  the 
Clean  Water  Act.  The  cooling  tower  blowdown  discharge  would  have  little  effect  on  the 
Delaware  River  at  this  location,  or  significantly  elevate  river  water  temperatures.  (0004-16-6 
[Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  Consumptive  water  use  is  an  important  issue  on  the  Delaware  River  basin, 
especially  during  drought  periods.  Although  the  proposed  plant  is  located  in  the  saline  estuary, 
fresh  water  will  still  be  evaporated  by  the  cooling  towers  and,  thereby,  consumed.  During 
declared  drought  emergencies,  the  fresh  water  consumed  should  be  replaced  at  an  appropriate 
ratio  by  using  water  release  from  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir  near  Phillipsburg,  New  Jersey.

PSEG,  along  with  several  other  electric  generating  companies,  is  a  co-owner  of  Merrill  Creek. 
Water  released  from  Merrill  Creek  helps  in  keeping  the  salt  line  from  moving  upstream  to  the 
water  intakes  for  the  city  of  Philadelphia.  Merrill  Creek  was  financed,  built,  and  operated  by 
electric  generating  companies  for  just  this  purpose.  (0004-16-7  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  One  of  the  things  about  this  project,  that  caught  my  attention,  was  the  fact  that  they 
are  going  to  plan  to  use  an  elevated  roadway  to  access  the  nuclear  plant.  In  the  past  what 
people  did  was  build  up  a  roadway  across  the  meadow.  And  that  would  involve,  literally,  tons 
and  tons  of  fill,  and  emplacement  of  culverts  and  bridges.  The  intent  was  to  get  the  vehicles  in 
and  out,  without  being  flooded  out  by  high  tide.  The  problem  with  that  is  that,  even  though,  you 
haven't  technically  altered  the  marsh,  other  than  that  which  is  underneath  the  footprint,  in  reality 
you  have  restricted  the  tidal  flow.  And  once  you  restrict  the  tidal  flow  the  area  no  longer 
functions  as  the  same  type  of  marsh  that  it  once  was.  This  enables  it  to  be  more  attractive  to 
invasive  plants,  such  as  phragmites,  also  known  as  common  reed  in  this  area.  And,  at  the 
same  time,  it  reduces  the  amount  of  flow,  and  that  means  that  there  is  less  fish  using  the  marsh. 
Today  we  have  another  alternative,  and  that  is  the  elevated  roadway.  The  one  that  PSEG  has 
proposed  is  going  to  be,  at  least,  ten  feet  above  the  surface  of  the  marsh.  By  doing  this  it  is 
going  to,  one,  not  impact  the  marsh  except  where  the  piers  come  into  the  marsh  itself.  The  fact 
that  it  is  ten  feet  above  will  also  reduce  the  amount  of  shading  that  comes  on,  underneath.  And 
thus  not  inhibit  the  growth  of  plants.  When  you  get  big  tides,  or  even  just  the  tide  that  you  get 
during  the  normal  full  moon,  you  are  going  to  have  water  flowing  all  the  way  across  that  area. 

But  it  will  be  underneath  the  roadway,  and  it  will  not  be  blocked  by  the  roadway  itself.  With  that 
you  are  going  to  have  a  much  better  situation,  you  will  be  able  to  get  vehicles  in  and  out.  And, 
at  the  same  time,  you  will  not  have  a  major  impact  on  the  meadow.  (0006-7-3  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Comment:  In  addition  the  plan  to  include  a  cooling  tower  for  the  new  facility,  would 
dramatically  reduce  the  amount  of  water  required  from  the  river  for  cooling  and  would, 
substantially,  mitigate  the  thermal  input  from  the  new  plant  to  Delaware  Bay.  (0006-8-8  [Duvau, 
Bryan]) 

Comment:  And  we  [Water  Resources  Association  of  the  Delaware  River]  have  wide  ranging 
interests  in  water  resources.  We  are  here,  today,  because  public  service  proposed  project  is  a 
major  water  usage,  located  in  the  Delaware  River,  and  has  an  important  part  of  the  economy  of 
New  Jersey  and  the  region  as  a  whole.  (0007-16-1  [Palmer,  Dennis]) 

Comment:  In  reviewing  the  application,  May  25th,  2010,  we  noted  new  units,  the  intake  and 
cooling  system  would  be  designed  to  minimize  the  impact  on  the  aquatic  community,  by  using 
cooling  towers.  And,  also,  the  intake  system  will  be  using  the  best  available  technology,  as 
required  by  section  316(b)  of  the  Clean  Water  Act.  The  cooling  tower  blowdown  discharge 
should  have  little  effect  on  the  Delaware  River  at  this  location,  especially,  or  elevate  river 
temperatures.  (0007-16-5  [Palmer,  Dennis]) 

Comment:  In  addition  consumptive  water  usage  is  an  important  issue  in  the  Delaware  River 
basin,  especially  during  droughts.  Although  the  proposed  plant  is  located  in  a  saline  estuary, 
fresh  water  will  still  be  evaporated  by  the  cooling  towers,  and  be  consumed.  During  declared 
drought  emergencies  the  fresh  water  consumed  should  be  replaced,  at  an  appropriate  ratio,  by 
using  water  released  from  the  Merrill  Creek  reservoir,  near  Phillipsburg,  New  Jersey.  PSEG,  as

well  as  other  several  electric  generation  companies  are  co-owners  of  Merrill  Creek,  and  the 
water  released  from  Merrill  Creek  will  help  keep  the  salt  line  from  moving  upstream  to  the  water 
intakes  of  the  city  of  Philadelphia.  Merrill  Creek  was  financed,  built,  and  operated  by  the 
electrical  generating  companies  for  this  purpose.  (0007-16-6  [Palmer,  Dennis]) 

Response :  These  comments  are  declarative  statements  and  raise  no  issues  with  the 
conclusions  of  the  draft  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  We  believe  that,  before  PSEG  should  be  allowed  to  construct  another  burdensome 
facility  on  Artificial  Island,  or  anywhere  within  the  Delaware  Estuary  before  it  is  even  considered, 
they  must  be  forced  to  minimize  the  adverse  environmental  impact  their  existing  facilities 
already  have.  Including  their  fish  kills,  their  harmful  imprint  on  our  wetlands,  the  water  quality 
impacts  they  have  on  the  Delaware  Estuary  waters,  and  more.  (0004-3-4  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Minimizing  impacts  from  existing  facilities  is  outside  the  scope  of  the  EIS.  The  draft 
EIS  evaluates  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  facility.  This  includes  the  cumulative 
impacts  of  the  existing  power  plants  and  the  proposed  facility ,  which  are  addressed  in  Chapter  7 
of  the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  I  am  not  a  scientist,  so  I'm  not  one  hundred  percent  sure  about  this,  but  I  know  that 
wetlands  absorb  water  and  mitigate  flooding.  So  I'm  wondering  how  filling  another  100-plus 
acres  of  wetlands,  which  we  are  already  losing  very  rapidly  to  sea  level  rise,  could  worsen  local 
flooding  in  Delaware  City,  and  St.  George's,  and  that  area  near  where  the  adjacent  island  would 
be  built,  I  imagine.  (0007-5-8  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Response:  The  impact  on  flooding  from  building  the  proposed  plant  was  discussed  in  Section 
4.2. 1. 1  of  the  draft  EIS.  As  described  there,  fill  material  would  be  placed  in  about  152  ac  of 
onsite  and  offsite  areas  within  the  existing  100-year  floodplain.  This  acreage  includes  108  ac  of 
wetlands.  Because  the  area  surrounding  the  proposed  plant  site  is  relatively  flat  and  flooding  is 
controlled  by  storm  surges,  the  existing  floodplain  is  large — estimated  by  PSEG  to  be  59,681  ac 
within  a  6-mi  radius  of  the  site.  Because  the  area  to  be  filled  is  much  less  than  1  percent  of  the 
existing  floodplain  area,  the  NRC  staff  concluded  that  building  the  proposed  plant  would  have 
minimal  effect  on  flooding.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-101 ;  Section  No.  4.1 1 ;  Table  4-20;  The  last  bullet  under  'Water  Use  and 
Quality"  states:  "Obtain  potable  water  from  a  local  municipality,  and  send  wastewater  to  be 
treated  by  a  local  municipality  so  as  not  to  affect  onsite  groundwater  resources"  This  is 
incorrect.  Page  4-73  states:  "PSEG  indicates  that  a  freshwater  aquifer  that  currently  supplies 
HCGS  and  SGS  would  also  supply  the  construction  site  with  potable  and  sanitary  water 
Page  4-74  states:  "There  would  be  no  offsite  treatment  of  wastewater  from  the  new  plant  (PSEG 
2014-TN3452)."  (0015-3-7  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  wording  in  Table  4-20  of  the  EIS  [Table  4-21  of  the  final  EIS]  has  been  revised 
to  reflect  the  use  of  groundwater  for  the  potable  and  sanitary  waste  system  and  the  treatment  of 
sanitary  waste  onsite.

Comment:  Page  No.  9-162;  Section  No.  9. 3. 4. 2;  Line  No.  20-21;  Change  "However,  the  review 
team  further  concludes  that  a  new  plant's  incremental  contribution  to  this  impact  would  be 
SMALL"  to  "However,  the  review  team  further  concludes  that  a  new  plant's  incremental 
contribution  to  this  impact  would  be  insignificant."  This  would  be  more  consistent  with  the 
discussions  of  plant  impacts  for  most  other  resource  areas.  (0015-6-13  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  conclusions  regarding  cumulative  impacts  on  water  use  and  water  quality  of 
the  alternative  sites  were  reworded  to  be  consistent  with  each  other  and  with  other  resource 
areas. 

Comment:  The  Draft  EIS  is  thorough  in  its  analysis  of  environmental  impacts,  however  it 
provides  insufficient  information  for  us  to  make  a  reasonable  judgment  as  to  whether  the 
proposed  discharge  will  comply  with  the  Clean  Water  Act  Section  404(b)(1 )  guidelines. 
Approximately  1 34  acres  of  wetlands  would  be  permanently  impacted  for  the  construction  of  the 
power  block  area,  cooling  tower  area,  the  switch  yard,  and  causeway.  (0017-1  [Mitchell,  Judy- 
Ann]) 

Response:  Under  the  CWA,  the  US  ACE  has  authority  to  permit  the  discharge  of  dredged  or  fill 
materials  to  wetlands.  CWA  Section  404(b)(1)  guidelines  would  be  considered  in  the  US  ACE 
review  of  PS  EG 's  discharge  permit  application.  Issuance  of  the  ESP  would  not  change  the 
requirement  for  PS  EG  to  obtain  a  discharge  permit  from  the  USACE.  Potential  impacts  to 
wetlands  and  possible  wetland  mitigation  measures  are  described  in  EIS  Section  4.3.1.  No 
changes  to  the  EIS  were  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  DEIS  does  an  inadequate  job  at  looking  at  the  overall  environmental  impacts 
from  dredging,  especially  to  water  quality  from  filling  in  wetlands  and  coastal 
resources  or  building  new  piers.  (0016-6  [Tittel,  Jeff]) 

Comment:  Section  4. 2. 1.1,  page  4-16-Delaware  River:  states  that  approximately  92  acres  of 
the  bottom  of  the  Delaware  River  will  be  dredged  (using  both  mechanical  and  hydraulic  means), 
resulting  in  about  665,000  cubic  yards  (CY)  of  dredged  material  that  "would  be  disposed  on  the 
site  or  at  another  approved  upland  disposal  site."  The  Office  of  Dredging  and  Sediment 
Technology  will  be  the  NJDEP  lead  on  all  dredging  and  dredged  material  management 
regulatory  actions  associated  with  the  proposed  PSEG  project.  The  DEIS  barely  discusses  the 
dredging  and  dredged  material  aspects  of  the  proposed  project.  All  dredging  and  dredged 
material  management  activities  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed 
PSEG  project  must  be  comprehensively  evaluated  in  the  DEIS.  This  would  include  sampling 
and  testing  of  the  sediment  to  be  dredged  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the  1 997  NJDEP 
Dredging  Technical  Manual.  (0021-4-12  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  Section  4. 2. 3.1,  page  4-22,  para.  #2:  potential  dredging  impacts  to  surface  water 
quality  cannot  be  evaluated  without  (a)  identifying  the  dredging  methods,  and  (b)  testing  the 
sediment  to  be  dredged  for  contaminants  of  concern.  (0021-4-13  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  The  dredging  and  construction  of  a  new  barge  mooring  facility  will  cause  immediate 
and  ongoing  damage  to  the  Delaware  River  which  was  not  fully  analyzed.  The  negative  effects

discharges  should  be  evaluated  and  weighed  against  the  need  for  a  new  barge  storage/ 
unloading  area.  (0022-9  [Butch,  Kerry  Margaret]  [King,  Charlotte]  [Pryde,  Coralie]) 

Comment:  The  dredging  and  construction  of  a  new  barge  mooring  facility  will  cause  immediate 
and  ongoing  damage  to  the  Delaware  River  which  was  not  fully  analyzed.  The  negative  effects 
on  water  quality  through  the  resuspension  of  toxics  from  dredging  and  through  vessel-related 
discharges  should  be  evaluated  and  weighed  against  the  need  for  a  new  barge  storage/ 
unloading  area.  (0034-10  [Carter,  David]  [DePaul,  Shelly]  [Furst,  Charles]  [Hvozdovich,  Steve]  [McNutt, 
Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [Owens,  Caroline]  [Pringle,  David]  [Roe,  Amy]  [Tittel,  Jeff]  [van  Rossum, 

Maya]) 

Response:  The  anticipated  hydrologic  alterations  and  water  quality  impacts  from  dredging  are 
discussed  in  EIS  Sections  4. 2. 1.1  and  4.2.3. 1,  respectively.  As  described  in  the  EIS,  dredging 
activities  would  be  regulated  under  a  combination  of  USACE  and  NJDEP  permits.  The  volume 
of  sediments  to  be  dredged  for  the  proposed  plant  is  a  fraction  of  the  volume  of  sediments 
dredged  for  the  Delaware  River  main  channel  deepening  project.  The  USACE  NEPA 
documentation  for  the  channel  deepening  project  concludes  that  there  would  be  no  significant 
water-quality  impacts  from  that  project.  The  majority  of  sediment  samples  from  Zone  5 
considered  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  Regional  Sediment  Management  Plan  were  suitable  or 
potentially  suitable  for  aquatic  habitat  and  upland  beneficial  uses.  As  part  of  the  NJDEP 
permitting  process,  specific  sediment  sampling,  water-quality  monitoring,  and  best  management 
practices  would  be  required.  The  discussion  of  dredging  impacts  in  EIS  Section  4.2.3. 1  was 
expanded  to  include  references  to  the  USACE  main  channel  deepening  documentation,  the 
Delaware  Estuary  Regional  Sediment  Management  Plan,  and  the  NJDEP  dredging  technical 
manual. 

Comment:  The  expanded  area  is  not  in  the  current  sewer  service  area.  Currently,  the  Hope 
Creek  Generating  station,  which  has  process  wastewater  as  well  as  sanitary  wastewater 
streams,  is  identified  on  Block  26,  Lot  4  only.  Should  the  expansion  or  new  reactor  create 
additional  process  and/or  sanitary  wastewater  on  an  expanded  lot,  the  applicant  will  have  to 
comply  with  the  Water  Quality  Management  Plan  (WQMP)  rules  at  NJAC  7:15-5.24  and  5.25. 
More  details  regarding  process  and/or  sanitary  wastewater  arc  required  in  order  to  fully  assess 
this  project.  (0021-5-13  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  As  stated  in  EIS  Section  5.2,  PS  EG  is  expected  to  comply  with  applicable  Federal, 
regional,  State,  and  local  regulations  during  the  operation  of  the  proposed  plant.  The  specific 
requirements  of  the  permits  would  be  determined  after  a  specific  design  for  the  plant  is  decided. 
No  changes  to  the  EIS  were  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  5-1 1  (Lines  6  and  7);  Comment:  PSEG  did  apply  for  a  renewal  of  the  31 6(a) 
variance  in  2006  as  part  of  their  overall  NJPDES  permit  renewal  request,  however,  the  renewal 
permit  has  not  yet  been  issued  by  NJDEP.  The  original  316(a)  variance  was  issued  in  the  200  I 
final  permit  and  remains  effective  as  a  result  of  PSEG's  submittal  of  a  timely  renewal 
application.  As  a  result,  this  language  should  be  clarified  as  follows:  "In  2006,  PSEG  applied  for 
the  NPDES  permit  renewal  with  a  request  for  renewal  of  the  316(a)  variance.  PSEG  submitted 
a  timely  application  for  renewal  of  the  NJPDES  permit,  therefore  the  conditions  of  their  expired 
permit  remain  in  effect  pursuant  to  N.J.A.C.  7:  14A2.8."  (0021-5-15  [Foster,  Ruth])

Response:  EIS  Section  5.2.3. 7  was  changed  to  reflect  the  content  of  the  comment. 

Comment:  Many  of  the  construction-related  impacts  are  noted  as  "temporary"  in  duration. 
However,  construction  activities  will  occur  over  an  estimated  time  period  of  7  years  (see  Table 
3-2,  page  3-20).  (0021-5-2  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  While  the  total  period  of  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  is  expected  to 
be  7  years,  the  impacts  to  specific  resources  occur  from  specific  building  activities,  which  are 
expected  to  be  of  shorter  durations,  as  noted  in  Table  3-2  of  the  EIS.  No  changes  to  the  EIS 
were  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  [The  NJDEP  Endangered  &  Non-game  Species  Program  concerns  include:] 
Possible  degradation  of  the  marsh  due  to  changes  in  hydrology,  spread  of  invasive  plants,  etc. 
(0021-3-4  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Impacts  to  the  marshlands  potentially  affected  by  the  proposed  plant  are  discussed 
in  the  relevant  subsections  of  EIS  Sections  4.2,  4.3,  5.2,  and  5.3.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were 
made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  5-12  (Lines  17-22);  Comment:  The  [NJDEP]  Department  has  determined  that 
the  section  summarizing  the  results  from  the  CORMIX  simulations  needs  to  be  clarified  and/or 
questioned  for  the  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Specifically,  it  is  counterintuitive  that  two  new  units 
with  cooling  towers  could  generate  a  smaller  thermal  plume  than  the  existing  Heat  Dissipation 
Area  (HDA)  for  the  single  unit  at  HCGS.  NRC  should  evaluate  the  conclusions  of  the  CORMIX 
simulations.  (0021-5-16  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  Page  5-13  Figure  5-2;  Comment:  Figure  5-2  is  misleading  in  comparing  a  1.5  °F 
Temperature  Envelope  for  the  new  plant  to  the  existing  HDA  for  the  HCGS.  The  HDA  for  HCGS 
is  larger  than  a  1 .5  °F  Temperature  Envelope  would  be  for  HCGS  because  it  includes  the 
allowable  increase  of  4  °F  from  September  through  May.  When  a  HDA  is  developed  for  the  new 
plant,  it  will  be  larger  than  the  extent  depicted  in  Figure  5-2,  with  a  greater  overlap  with  the 
HCGS  HDA.  (0021-5-17  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  review  team  found  the  results  from  the  CORMIX  simulations  to  be  acceptable. 
The  review  team  acknowledges  that  the  expected  average  discharge  rate  for  the  proposed  plant 
would  be  approximately  60  percent  larger  than  the  average  discharge  for  HCGS  and  expects 
that  a  heat  dissipation  area  (HDA)  for  the  proposed  plant  would  be  larger  in  size  than  the  HDA 
for  the  HCGS.  The  EIS  was  modified  to  clarify  the  review  team's  conclusions  on  these  issues. 

Comment:  A  Water  Allocation  Temporary  Dewatering  Permit  will  be  required  for  construction 
dewatering  where  the  dewatering  rate  is  100,000  gallons  per  day  or  more  for  more  than  30  days 
in  a  consecutive  365-day  period.  If  the  dewatering  period  is  30  days  or  less,  a  Permit  by  Rule 
will  suffice  however  it  is  expected  the  construction  phase  will  be  considerably  longer.  A 
Dewatering  Permit  by  Rule  may  be  applicable  if  the  dewatering  occurs  from  within  a  coffer  dam.

Appendix  E 


Response:  The  authority  of  NJDEP  to  permit  temporary  dewatering  during  building  of  the 
proposed  plant  is  acknowledged  in  Section  4.2  of  the  EIS.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were  made  in 
response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  5-12  (Lines  24-28);  Comment:  It  is  true  that  the  extent  of  the  thermal  plume 
from  a  new  plant  will  be  small  in  comparison  to  the  existing  SGS  HDA.  However,  NRC  has  not 
discussed  the  additive  effect  of  the  overlapping  thermal  discharges  from  all  three  power  plants 
(SGS,  HCGS,  and  the  new  plant)  and  is  understating  the  effects  of  the  impacts  of  thermal 
discharges  from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  as  minor  relying  on  the  basis  that  SGS  has  greater 
impacts.  (0021-5-18  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  potential  additive  effect  of  the  thermal  plumes  from  SGS,  HCGS,  and  the 
proposed  plant  is  discussed  in  EIS  Sections  5.2.3. 7  and  7.2.2. 7.  The  EIS  was  modified  to 
clarify  that  while  the  review  team  expects  the  HDA  for  the  proposed  plant  to  overlap  the  existing 
HDA  for  the  HCGS,  significant  overlap  of  these  two  thermal  plumes  is  not  expected  during  the 
summer  months  due  to  the  relatively  small  size  of  the  plumes. 

Comment:  The  EIS  identifies  that  impacts  will  occur  from  the  facilities  discharge.  Possible 
outcomes  include  thermal,  chemical  and  physical  effects  on  the  substrate  and  hydrological 
changes.  The  EIS  goes  on  further  to  say  that  these  effects  were  found  to  be  minimal.  Detailed 
information  is  required  on  how  these  effects  were  deemed  to  be  minimal.  (0021-2-17  [Foster, 
Ruth]) 

Response:  Water-quality  impacts  from  the  proposed  plant's  discharge  are  evaluated  in  EIS 
Section  5.2.3. 7.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  2. 3. 3.1,  page  2-45:  includes  a  minimal  presentation  and  discussion  of 
current  surface  water  quality  data  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  site;  thus,  it  is  not  possible  to 
evaluate  the  potential  impacts  of  the  proposed  project  on  surface  water  quality  based  on  the 
information  provided  in  the  DEIS.  (0021-4-8  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  EIS  Section  2.3.3. 7  provides  a  summary  of  Delaware  River  water-quality 
information  contained  in  Delaware  River  Basin  Commission  reports.  The  EIS  also  provides  a 
summary  of  water-quality  data  obtained  by  the  applicant  in  the  Delaware  River,  the  onsite 
artificial  ponds,  and  the  nearby  marsh.  More  detailed  information  is  contained  in  the  PSEG  ER, 
and  references  to  the  specific  ER  tables  containing  this  information  were  added  to  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Section  4.3.3. 1,  page  4-45-Delaware  River  Estuary:  an  additional  1,350-7,150  CY 
of  dredged  material  may  have  to  be  managed,  depending  on  the  final  design  of  the  proposed 
PSEG  project.  Also,  this  section  of  the  DEIS  estimates  that  about  590,000  CY  of  sediment  will 
be  dredged  (again,  subject  to  final  project  design),  but  Section  4. 2. 1.1  (page  4-16-see  above 
comment)  estimates  that  665,000  CY  of  dredged  material  will  be  generated.  (0021-4-14  [Foster, 
Ruth]) 

Response:  Section  4.3.2. 7  (formerly  4.3.3. 1)  of  the  EIS  was  changed  to  reflect  the  correct  total 
estimated  volume  of  dredged  sediment— 665,000  yd3.

addressed.  [Also  see  Section  5.2.3,  page  5-14-Physical  Effects  of  Discharge,  and  Section 
5.3.2. 1,  page  5-39-Physical  Impacts.]  (0021-4-17  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  potential  impacts  of  maintenance  dredging  are  discussed  in  EIS  Section  5.3.2. 
The  US  ACE  Department  of  the  Army  authorization  will  address  maintenance  dredging

E.2.8  Comments  Concerning  Groundwater  Hydrology 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-41;  Section  No.  2. 3. 1.2;  Line  No.  17-19;  The  DEIS  states  "The  majority 
of  these  gradients  indicated  downward  flow  from  the  alluvium  to  the  Vincentown  aquifer.  Where 
it  is  present,  the  low  permeability  of  the  intervening  Upper  Kirkwood  unit  limits  vertical  flow 
between  the  two  units."  This  suggests  there  is  downward  flow  in  a  majority  of  cases.  It  would  be 
more  accurate  to  say  "The  majority  of  measurements  indicate  a  downward  vertical  hydraulic 
gradient  between  the  alluvium  and  the  Vincentown  aquifers."  There  is  not  necessarily  hydraulic 
communication  between  these  two  units  due  to  the  presence  of  the  intervening  Kirkwood 
aquitard.  (0015-1-10  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  comment  refers  to  two  statements  made  in  the  draft  EIS.  The  first  statement  is 
based  on  vertical  hydraulic  gradient  data  provided  in  Table  2.3-16  of  the  ER  (see  PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  In  this  table,  a  majority  (11  of  16)  of  vertical  gradients  are  indicative  of  downward 
groundwater  flow.  The  magnitude  of  the  actual  vertical  flow  will  depend  primarily  on  the 
thickness  and  permeability  of  the  low-permeability  sediments  identified  in  the  ER  as  the  upper 
Kirkwood  formation.  Borehole  data  reported  in  the  ER  indicate  that  the  thickness  of  the 
sediments  identified  in  the  ER  as  the  upper  Kirkwood  formation  varies  across  the  site  and  that 
these  sediments  were  not  encountered  at  two  borings.  The  statements  in  the  EIS  reflect 
information  in  the  ER  and  conform  to  accepted  groundwater-flow  concepts.  No  changes  to  the 
EIS  were  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-42;  Section  No.  2. 3. 1.2;  Line  No.  32-33;  The  DEIS  states:  "There  is  a 
component  of  groundwater  flow  in  the  alluvium  that  is  directed  to  the  northeast,  with  likely 
discharge  to  the  marsh.  This  marsh  drains  to  the  Delaware  River  via  Fishing  Creek  to  the  north 
of  the  PSEG  Site."  This  is  inconsistent  with  the  release  scenario  described  in  the  response  to 
SSAR  RAI  68.  In  the  response  to  RAI  68,  groundwater  flow  to  the  northeast  in  the  alluvium 
discharges  at  Fishing  Creek  and  not  to  the  marsh.  The  statement  should  be  modified  to  read: 
"There  is  a  component  of  groundwater  flow  in  the  alluvium  that  is  directed  to  the  northeast,  with 
likely  discharge  to  Fishing  Creek  which  flows  into  the  Delaware  River  to  the  north  of  the  PSEG 
Site."  (0015-1-11  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  This  comment  concerns  the  connection  between  shallow  groundwater  and  the 
surface  waters  east  of  the  site.  Section  2.4. 13  in  the  SSAR  (see  PSEG  2014-TN3453) 
describes  a  transport  pathway  east  of  the  PSEG  Site  toward  Fishing  Creek,  but  makes  clear 
that  a  number  of  assumptions  were  made  to  produce  a  conservative  ( rapid  transport)  result, 
including  the  assumption  that  the  groundwater-transport  pathway  occurs  through  the  alluvium

directly  to  Fishing  Creek.  Figure  2.5. 1-28  of  the  SSAR  indicates  that  the  surficial  deposits  in  the 
region  between  the  PS  EG  Site  and  Fishing  Creek  are  comprised  of  salt-marsh  deposits.  This 
area  is  outside  the  current  USACE  confined  disposal  facility  and  is  primarily  outside  the  current 
PSEG  property.  The  PSEG  Site  investigation  located  only  two  shallow  piezometers  in  the  area 
(AS-05  and  AS-06,  as  shown  in  ER  Figure  2.3-21;  see  PSEG  2014-TN3452),  and  as  a  result, 
the  actual  connection  between  shallow  groundwater  and  the  surface  waters  in  the  marsh  is 
uncertain.  In  addition,  ER  Section  2.3. 1.2.3. 1  states  that  the  upper  groundwater  in  the  east 
location  of  the  PSEG  Site  discharges  to  the  marsh.  The  statement  in  the  draft  EIS  that 
groundwater  in  the  alluvium  will  likely  discharge  to  the  marsh  is  consistent  with  the  totality  of 
information  presented  in  the  ER  and  SSAR  given  the  evident  uncertainties.  No  changes  to  the 
EIS  were  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  p.  2-39,  lines  20-21.  Indicates  Figure  2-18  shows  the  stratigraphy  of  the  PSEG  site 
based  on  geotechnical  borings.  Comment:  When  Figure  2-18  is  examined  there  are  problems 
with  the  unit  identifications,  especially  in  the  upper  part  of  the  borings.  There  is  no  Kirkwood, 
either  upper  or  lower,  at  Artificial  Island  (sec  Owens  and  others,  1998).  The  Kirkwood  was 
eroded  away  during  the  Pleistocene  and  the  sand  (lower  Kirkwood)  and  the  clay  (upper 
Kirkwood)  above  the  sand  and  below  the  artificial  fill  and  alluvium  arc  both  late  Pleistocene 
deposits  (see  Owens  and  Minard,  1979).  The  figure  also  shows  the  Hornerstown  and  Navesink 
Formations  as  too  shallow  at  the  site.  Since  the  EIS  references  this  figure  as  being  from  the 
PSEG  (TN3452),  that  report  was  checked,  but  no  boring  information  could  be  found  there.  The 
SSAR,  [PSEG  (TN3453)],  was  found  to  have  the  boring  logs  and  other  information.  When  the 
logs  were  reviewed  it  is  evident  that  the  geologists  logging  the  borings  misidentified  the 
Hornerstown  and  Navesink  in  every  boring.  They  describe  the  Hornerstown  as  a  fine  to  silty 
sand  having  a  trace  to  a  few  glauconite  or  a  few  to  little  glauconite.  The  Hornerstown  Formation 
contains  the  highest  glauconite  content  found  in  any  geologic  formation  in  New  Jersey.  The 
glauconite  ranges  between  40  and  90%  of  the  sand  fraction,  not  a  trace  or  few  grains  as  is 
described  in  the  boring  logs.  (0021-1-10  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  p.  2-41 ,  Table  2-7.  Comment:  There  is  no  Kirkwood  Formation  at  Artificial  Island. 
Also  as  mentioned  above  the  geologists  that  described  the  borings  for  SSAR  and  ER 
misidentified  the  Hornerstown  Formation.  In  the  ER,  p.  2.6-6,  they  describe  the  Hornerstown 
Formation  as  having  a  trace  to  some  glauconite  at  the  site  and  they  indicate  the  glauconite 
increases  with  depth.  They  further  indicate  that  the  glauconite  can  make  up  greater  than  30% 
of  the  sand  fraction  near  the  base  of  the  formation.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  Vincentown- 
Hornerstown  contact  is  generally  placed  where  there  is  a  significant  increase  in  glauconite  from 
about  20  to  40%.  The  Hornerstown  Formation  is  the  easiest  unit  to  recognize  in  the  New  Jersey 
because  of  its  high  glauconite  content.  The  depths  to  top  of  Hornerstown  would  be  deeper  than 
is  indicated.  Note,  the  boring  information  was  found  in  Appendix  2AA  (Boring  Logs),  of  the

Navesink  contact  over  40  feet  higher  because  the  geologists  logging  the  borings  at  the  plant 
were  misidentifying  the  Hornerstown  Formation  as  indicated  above.  (0021-1-13  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  [0]n  page  2-1 70  of  this  EIS,  Figure  2-30,  the  description  of  Hornerstown  indicates  it 
is  highly  glauconitic,  not  a  trace  of  glauconite  as  the  boring  logs  indicate.  The  first  appearance 
of  any  significant  amount  of  glauconite  in  the  logs  is  what  they  are  identifying  as  the  Navesink 
Formation,  but  it  is  in  fact,  the  Hornerstown  Formation.  Owens  and  others  (1998),  at  a  scale  of 
1:100,000,  shows  Kirkwood  eroded  away  with  the  Vincentown  Formation  being  the  youngest 
pre-Pleistocene  formation  at  Artificial  Island.  Stanford  (201 1 ),  at  a  scale  of  1 :24,000  also 
indicates  that  the  Kirkwood  Formation  is  not  present  at  Artificial  Island  since  it  was  eroded  away 
during  the  lllinoian  lowstand  about  150,000  years  ago.  Descriptions  of  the  Hornerstown 
Formation  can  be  found  in  Owens  and  others  (1998),  Miller  and  others  (2005),  and  Rosenau 
and  others  (1969).  (0021-1-20  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  reviewed  the  reports  and  maps  cited  in  these  and  other  comments 
related  to  the  interpretation  of  the  sediments  at  the  PS  EG  Site  located  above  the  Vincentown 
Formation.  The  NRC  staff  agrees  that  these  reports  and  maps  are  consistent  with  these 
comments.  The  relevant  sections  of  the  EIS  have  been  changed  to  be  consistent  with  the 
interpretation  of  these  sediments  as  reflected  in  the  reports  and  maps  reviewed  by  the  NRC 
staff.  The  NRC  staff  also  reviewed  the  reports  cited  in  these  and  other  comments  related  to  the 
description  of  the  Hornerstown  Formation.  The  staff  agrees  that  these  reports  are  consistent 
with  these  comments.  The  relevant  sections  of  the  EIS  have  been  changed  to  be  consistent 
with  the  description  of  the  Hornerstown  Formation  as  a  glauconite-rich  unit  as  reflected  in  the 
reports  reviewed  by  the  NRC  staff. 

Comment:  It  is  important  to  recognize  that  the  Kirkwood  Formation  is  not  present  at  Artificial 
Island  since  it  means  that  the  "confining"  clays  above  the  Vincentown  Formation  are  not 
regional  in  extent.  The  clays  on  site  arc  limited  in  aerial  extent  and  do  not  form  a  single  layer 
extending  inland  for  miles  protecting  aquifers  below  the  water  table  as  they  would  if  they  were 
actually  the  clays  of  the  Kirkwood  Formation.  The  clay  and  lower  sand  are  Pleistocene  deposits 
and  that  is  the  reason  why  they  are  so  variable  in  thickness  and  extent  at  the  site.  (0021-1-11 
[Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  p.  2-39,  lines  37-38.  Comment:  There  is  no  Kirkwood  Formation  at  Artificial  Island. 
The  clay  separating  the  alluvium  from  the  Vincentown  Formation  is  Pleistocene,  not  Miocene  as 
is  the  Kirkwood  Formation.  (0021-1-12  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  p.  2-41 ,  line  18.  Comment:  There  is  no  Kirkwood  Formation  at  the  site.  The  clay 
over  the  Vincentown  Formation  is  Pleistocene.  (0021-1-14  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  p.  4-17,  line  28-29.  The  EIS  indicates  the  excavation  would  be  down  through  the 
fill,  alluvium,  and  Kirkwood  into  the  Vincentown.  Comment:  Again  note  there  is  no  Kirkwood 
Formation  present  at  Artificial  Island.  The  Kirkwood  Formation  was  eroded  away  in  this  area 
during  the  late  Tertiary  and  early  Pleistocene  and  the  Cape  May  Formation  was  deposited  in  the 
incised  river  valley  between  450,000  and  200,000  years  ago  (Stanford,  201 1  ).  (0021-2-5  [Foster,

site.  (0021-2-6  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  reviewed  the  reports  and  maps  cited  in  these  and  other  comments 
related  to  the  interpretation  of  the  sediments  at  the  PS  EG  Site  located  above  the  Vincentown 
Formation.  The  NRC  staff  agrees  that  these  reports  and  maps  are  consistent  with  these 
comments.  The  relevant  sections  of  the  EIS  have  been  changed  to  be  consistent  with  the 
interpretation  of  these  sediments  as  reflected  in  the  reports  and  maps  reviewed  by  the  NRC 
staff. 

Comment:  The  DEIS  relies  heavily  on  a  1988  study  authored  by  Dames  and  Moore,  (Section 
5.2.2,  page  5-9  of  the  DEIS).  This  study  predicted  approximately  15  to  20  feet  of  drawdown 
after  20  years  at  4  miles  from  the  facility  using  a  one-dimensional  drawdown  calculation.  A 
single  calculation  of  one-dimensional  drawdown  does  not  seem  adequate  for  an  assessment  of 
groundwater  impacts  from  a  nuclear  power  plant.  Nonetheless,  a  similar  one-dimensional 
calculation  was  used  to  project  the  impact  of  using  an  additional  210  gpm  for  40  years.  The 
estimate  of  210  gpm  for  the  new  facility  came  from  a  water  balance  diagram  (Figure  3-2  of  the 
DEIS).  Although  several  cooling  options  are  presented,  it  is  not  clear  how  this  withdrawal  was 
derived.  (0023-2-2  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  1988  Dames  and  Moore  study  used  a  two-dimensional  model  of  groundwater 
flow.  The  review  team  used  the  results  of  that  study  to  evaluate  the  analytical  solution  used  in 
its  independent  assessment.  The  review  team  selected  the  one-dimensional  analytical  solution 
because  it  conforms  well  to  the  conceptual  model  of  the  layered  aquifer  system  of  the  New 
Jersey  Coastal  Plain.  The  freshwater  requirements  of  the  proposed  plant  are  taken  from  the 
ER,  as  cited  in  EIS  Section  5. 2. 2. 2.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  in  response  to  this 
comment. 

Comment:  The  maximum  proposed  withdrawal  is  953  gpm  (Section  3.2.1. 1,  line  15  of  the 
DEIS).  The  projected  impact  of  210  gpm  withdrawal  for  40  years  at  5  miles  is  14.4  feet  of 
drawdown.  At  peak  withdrawal  periods,  the  drawdown  at  5  miles  could  be  between  14.4  and  65 
feet.  There  is  not  enough  data  to  precisely  calculate  the  impact  that  this  peak  use  could  already 
be  having  on  the  Potomoc  aquifer  wells  in  southern  New  Castle  County  in  Delaware.  However, 
hydrologists  within  the  Delaware  Divison  of  Water  estimated  possible  capacity  losses  for  some 
Delaware  wells  and  are  concerned  about  the  continued  viability  of  these  wells  given  the 
predicted  increase  in  water  usage  of  the  proposed  new  facility.  (0023-2-3  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  As  stated  in  EIS  Section  5. 2. 2. 2,  the  maximum  rate  would  occur  only  during 
abnormal  conditions  and  would  thus  be  temporary.  As  a  result,  the  review  team  used  the 
average  withdrawal  rate  to  assess  impacts  of  the  groundwater  withdrawals.  No  changes  to  the 
EIS  were  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  further  impact  that  is  partially  addressed  in  the  DEIS  is  saltwater  intrusion. 
Section  5.2. 3. 2  (page  5-15)  states:  "Recent  estimates  place  the  250  mg/L  line  of  equal  chloride 
concentration  close  to  Artificial  Island  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  (dePaul  et  al.  2009-TN2948)." 
Saltwater  intrusion  is  already  active  along  the  New  Jersey  coastline  and  could  advance  toward 
New  Castle  County  if  not  properly  managed.  The  same  section  (page  5-16)  of  the  DEIS  states:

NUREG-2168 


Appendix  E 


"The  available  data  and  the  modeling  results  suggest  that  operational  pumping  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  would  increase  chloride  concentrations  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer,  but 
these  increases  would  be  manageable."  Although  the  need  for  management  is  acknowledged, 
no  management  strategy  is  proposed.  A  saltwater  management  strategy  must  include  maps  of 
chloride  concentrations,  monitor  well  locations  and  a  monitoring  plan.  None  of  these  have  been 
proposed  or  provided.  (0023-2-4  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  As  stated  in  EIS  Section  5.2,  groundwater  use  at  the  site  would  be  subject  to 
Delaware  River  Basin  Commission  and  NJDEP  requirements,  including  limits  on  withdrawals 
and  monitoring  requirements,  such  as  occurs  for  the  existing  units.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were 
made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  current  Water  Allocation  Permit,  No.  221 6P  requires  modification  if  additional 
groundwater  withdrawal  or  additional  groundwater  sources  are  planned  for  the  new  plant. 
Included  with  such  a  request  for  major  modification  of  the  Water  Allocation  Permit  will  be  a 
Hydrogeologic  Report  prepared  in  accordance  with  TM-12-2  guidelines  pursuant  to  N.J.A.C.  7: 
19-2. 2(c).  (0021-6-2  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  The  Delaware  Division  of  Water  has  an  informal  prohibition  of  new  water  allocations 
from  the  Potomac  aquifer  in  New  Castle  County,  similar  to  New  Jersey's  Water  Supply  Critical 
Area  2.  Upon  consideration  of  the  scant  information  provided  in  the  DEIS,  it  appears  that  this 
prohibition  should  remain  in  effect  for  the  proposed  facility,  and  the  new  water  use  should  not  be 
approved  without  substantial  new  information  and  justification.  (0023-2-5  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  As  stated  in  EIS  Section  5.2,  groundwater  use  at  the  site  would  be  subject  to 
Delaware  River  Basin  Commission  and  NJDEP  requirements,  including  limits  on  withdrawals 
and  monitoring  requirements,  such  as  occurs  for  the  existing  units.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were 
made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  2. 3. 3. 2  "Groundwater  Quality",  Page  2-50,  Lines  1-3:  The  statement  that 
SGS  Unit  2  "  ...has  a  tritium  monitoring  system  often  wells  installed  due  to  elevated  tritium 
concentrations  in  the  shallow  aquifer  resulting  from  precipitation  capture  of  vented  tritiated  water 
vapor"  is  incorrect.  According  to  PSEG  Nuclear,  these  wells  were  installed  "to  assist  in 
identifying  potential  leaks  from  Salem  Unit  2"  following  the  discovery  of  a  leak  of  condensate 
from  an  expansion  joint  on  the  SGS  Unit  2  plant  vent.  The  "highly  tritiated"  water  that  escaped 
from  the  expansion  joint  leaked  onto  the  Auxiliary  Building  roof  and  was  transported  to  nearby 
catch  basins  via  the  roof  drain  and  stormwater  collection  system  (PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC, 

Remedial  Action  Progress  Repotl,  Second  Quarter  2013,  January  28,  2014).  (0021-1-1  [Foster, 
Ruth]) 

Comment:  p.  2-50,  lines  1-5.  The  report  indicates  here  that  tritium  on  the  north  side  of  Salem 
2  is  not  due  to  a  major  release  into  the  subsurface  but  due  to  tritium  capture  by  precipitation  of 
vented  tritiated  water  vapor.  Our  Comment:  The  tritium  capture  is  a  theory,  but  is  not  a  proven 
fact,  as  the  cause  of  the  tritium  on  the  north  side  of  Unit  2.  Tritium  occurs  both  in  the  shallow 
water  table  aquifer  and  in  the  deeper  Vincentown  aquifer  in  wells  CB  and  K  significantly  above 
background.  (0021-1-17  [Foster,  Ruth])

Appendix  E 


Comment:  Section  7. 2.2.2  "Impacts  on  Groundwater  Quality",  Page  7-16,  Lines  31-40:  The 
existing  and  potential  impacts  on  groundwater  quality  arc  not  accurately  characterized  here. 

The  NRC  states  "The  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  have  impacted  shallow  groundwater  quality,  but 
these  impacts  have  been  minor  and  have  been  limited  to  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  PSEG 
Site."  As  documented  in  the  previous  comment  however,  existing  impacts  to  groundwater 
quality  have  not  been  limited  to  the  shallow  groundwater.  Ground  water  contamination 
attributable  to  the  spent  fuel  pool  leak  at  Salem  Unit  I  has  been  detected  in  the  deeper 
Vincentown  Aquifer.  The  extent  of  the  contamination  in  this  aquifer  has  yet  to  be  determined. 
(0021-1-6  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  With  regard  to  potential  impacts  on  groundwater  quality,  the  NRC  states  "Potential 
impacts  to  groundwater  quality  could  come  from  inadvertent  spills  that  could  migrate  to  the 
shallow  water  zones."  This  statement  incorrectly  assumes  that  the  impact  of  any  spills  will  be 
limited  to  the  shallow  groundwater  at  the  site.  Recent  experience  at  Salem  Unit  I,  as  well  as  the 
Oyster  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station  in  Lacey  Township,  New  Jersey,  has  clearly 
demonstrated  that  the  probability  that  tritium  contaminated  water  released  into  shallow 
unconfined  aquifers  will  ultimately  reach  deeper  confined  aquifers  is  much  greater  than 
previously  predicted.  Construction  activities  typically  associated  with  nuclear  power  plants, 
such  as  deep  excavations  for  building  foundations  and  other  structures,  and  the  installation  of 
cofferdams  to  support  dewatering  operations,  can  significantly  alter  site  hydrological  conditions. 
An  unintended  consequence  of  these  activities  has  been  the  creation  of  downward  pathways 
that  have  allowed  contaminants  to  pass  through  the  confining  layers  into  the  deeper  aquifers. 
(0021-1-7  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Portions  of  EIS  Sections  2. 3. 3. 2  and  7.2. 2. 2  describing  the  tritium  contamination  of 
groundwater  at  the  SGS  were  modified  to  correct  inaccuracies  and  to  reflect  more  recent 
documentation  of  the  remediation  and  monitoring.  The  EIS  acknowledges  the  tritium  observed 
in  the  alluvium  and  the  Vincentown  aquifer.  As  described  in  the  EIS,  groundwater  in  the 
alluvium  and  in  the  Vincentown  aquifer  is  saline  and  not  suitable  for  potable  use.  In  addition, 
groundwater  in  the  alluvium  and  the  Vincentown  aquifer  discharges  to  the  Delaware  River. 
Low-permeability  sediments  underlie  the  Vincentown  aquifer,  reducing  the  hydrologic 
connection  between  the  Vincentown  aquifer  and  lower,  potable  aquifers.  Finally,  estimates  of 
the  cumulative  tritium  discharge  from  the  groundwater  to  the  Delaware  River  are  much  smaller 
than  the  permitted  tritium  discharges  from  the  normal  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  suggesting 
that  the  impact  on  the  river  of  tritium  discharge  from  groundwater  is  small. 

Comment:  p.  2-49,  lines  24-41.  The  EIS  discusses  the  tritium  leak  and  groundwater 
remediation  at  Salem  and  lines  33-35  indicates  the  leak  at  the  spent  fuel  has  been  remediated. 
Comment:  The  actual  leak  has  not  been  scaled.  PSEG  is  just  preventing  the  spent  fuel  pool 
water  from  reaching  the  environment  by  better  maintenance  of  the  tell  tails  and  collecting  the 
water  that  builds  up  in  the  seismic  gap.  It  should  be  noted  that  if  approval  is  given  and 
construction  began  on  a  new  plant,  any  dewatering  would  have  to  closely  monitored  to  prevent 
any  remaining  tritium  or  any  other  contaminants  in  either  the  water  table  or  Vincentown  aquifers 
from  being  pulled  into  uncontaminated  areas  of  both.  (0021-1-16  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Section  2. 3. 3. 2  of  the  EIS  does  not  state  that  the  spent  fuel  pool  leak  at  SGS  Unit  7 
has  been  remediated,  only  that  the  source  of  the  release  of  contaminated  water  to  the

environment  has  been  remediated  by  clearing  the  telltale  drains  and  removing  water  behind  the 
spent  fuel  pool  liner.  Section  4.2.4  of  the  EIS  notes  that  monitoring  of  groundwater  will  occur 
during  construction  dewatering  to  avoid  adverse  impacts  to  the  SGS  and  HCGS  and  to  evaluate 
changes  in  water  quality  in  the  alluvium  and  Vincentown  aquifer.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were 
made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  p.  4-23  and  2-24,  Section  4. 2. 3. 2  Groundwater  Quality  Impacts.  Comment:  This 
section  discusses  various  potential  spills  such  as  gasoline,  etc.  but  fails  to  mention  or  discuss 
the  ongoing  groundwater  cleanup  of  the  tritium  at  the  Salem  Generating  Station.  Since  the 
contamination  is  in  both  the  water  table  and  the  Vincentown  aquifers,  any  dewatering  in  either  of 
these  water  bearing  zones  will  affect  any  remaining  plumes  of  contamination.  Since  the 
Vincentown  Formation  is  semi-confined  at  Artificial  Island  the  dewatering  affects  will  extend  out 
significantly  further  than  in  the  water  table  aquifer.  (0021-2-8  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Tritium  contamination  of  groundwater  resulting  from  the  operation  of  the  SGS  is 
described  in  EIS  Section  2. 3. 3. 2.  Section  4.2.4  of  the  EIS  notes  that  monitoring  of  groundwater 
will  occur  during  construction  dewatering  to  avoid  adverse  impacts  to  the  SGS  and  HCGS  and 
to  evaluate  changes  in  water  quality  in  the  alluvium  and  Vincentown  aquifer.  No  changes  to  the 
EIS  were  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Relevant  information  is  omitted  in  the  DEIS.  Readily  available  data,  such  as  water 
use  graphs  and  water  level  hydrographs  for  the  existing  plant  were  not  provided.  Although 
frequent  references  are  made  to  other  studies,  the  references  do  not  include  page  numbers  or 
figure  numbers,  and  are  very  burdensome  when  further  information  is  needed.  (0023-2-6 
[Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  review  team  strove  to  include  information  in  the  EIS  that  was  directly  relied  on 
for  its  evaluation  of  impacts.  Additional  supporting  information  was  provided  by  reference  to 
particular  documents,  but  not  specific  portions  of  those  documents  (e.g.,  page  or  figure 
numbers).  The  review  team  apologizes  for  the  inconvenience.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were 
made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Natural  replenishment  of  ground  water  is  probably  not  occurring  in  the  middle  and 
lower  PRM  aquifers  as  evidenced  by  the  results  of  USGS  monitoring.  A  localized  cone  of 
depression  is  present  in  Salem  County  centered  at  Artificial  Island  as  the  result  of  local  pumping 
from  both  the  middle  and  undifferentiated  PRM,  and  the  Lower  PRM  aquifers.  A  regional  cone 
of  depression  extends  from  New  Castle  County,  Delaware  encompassing  Salem  County  as  a 
result  of  heavy  pumping  in  the  Middletown  and  St.  Georges  USGS  quadrangles  in  Delaware 
where  water  levels  are  as  low  as  -187  feet  in  the  Lower  PRM,  and  -58  in  the  Middle  PRM. 
(0021-6-4  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  Additionally,  there  is  recent  literature  available  that  pertains  to  this  site.  The  United 
States  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  updated  the  stratigraphic  framework  of  the  Potomac 
aquifer  in  Delaware  and  adjacent  areas  in  Maryland  and  New  Jersey  in  2004  (Benson,  2006). 
This  update  includes  the  area  surrounding  the  PSEG  site.  The  USACE  used  the  stratigraphic 
approach  to  develop  their  three  dimensional  finite  element  groundwater  model  for  the  Potomac 
Formation.  The  time-stratigraphic  framework  of  the  model  allows  for  the  potential  correlation  of 


NUREG-2168

Appendix  E 


aquifer-quality  sands  that  may  be  genetically  related  at  the  time  of  their  deposition  and  therefore 
may  be  better  connected  hydraulically  (Benson,  2006).  In  contrast,  the  model  cited  in  the  DEIS 
(Martin  1998)  is  based  on  a  sequence  of  aquifers  and  confining  beds  based  on  general 
hydraulic  properties  of  sediment  and  may  not  accurately  represent  the  degree  of  lateral 
transmissivity  of  groundwater.  Additionally,  the  USACE  model  assumes  direct  recharge  to  the 
uppermost  aquifer  sands  and  limited  or  no  recharge  to  lower  aquifers  from  the  surficial  aquifer 
(Benson,  2006).  In  contrast,  the  Martin  1998  model  assumed  direct  recharge  to  all  aquifers 
from  the  unconfined  aquifers.  (0023-2-7  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Comment:  Based  on  the  information  presented  in  the  DEIS,  one  cannot  dismiss  the  concern 
that  additional  pumping  at  the  PSEG  site  would  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  PRM  aquifer 
system  regionally.  An  impact  to  the  PRM  may  affect  the  quantity  and  quality  of  drinking  water 
available  to  the  citizens  of  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  To  address  these  concerns,  a  finite 
analytical  model  should  be  developed  using  current  site-specific  data.  (0023-2-8  [Cooksey,

addresses  the  stratigraphy  within  the  Middle  and  Lower  Potomac-Raritan-Magothy  (PRM) 
aguifers  and  would  mainly  affect  the  interpretation  of  the  connection  between  these  aquifers  and 
the  nature  of  recharge  to  these  aquifers.  The  draft  EIS  acknowledged  the  leaky  nature  of  the 
PRM  aquifer  in  the  vicinity  of  the  proposed  plant  site,  and  assumed  that  recharge  to  the  Middle 
and  Lower  PRM  aquifers  occurs  to  the  east  of  the  proposed  plant  site,  consistent  with  the 
USACE  model.  The  review  team  notes  that  results  from  the  USACE  simulations  show  that 
Delaware  groundwater  pumping  is  likely  to  be  significantly  impacting  groundwater  in  New 
Jersey.  The  review  team  believes  the  USACE  groundwater  simulations  provide  additional 
evidence  that  the  estimated  average  groundwater  pumping  for  the  proposed  plant  would  have  a 
minor  impact  on  groundwater  use  and  quality  in  Delaware.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS 
in  response  to  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  site  is  south  of  Water  Supply  Critical  Area  No.  2.  Increases  in  withdrawals 
from  the  PRM  Aquifer  are  being  reviewed  by  BWA  WP  due  to  concerns  with  safe  yield  and  salt 
water  intrusion.  The  results  of  the  draft  2008  and  2013  USGS  synoptic  groundwater-level 
measurements  indicate  that  the  water  levels  in  the  Middle  PRM  aquifer  where  the  site  obtains 
their  industrial  water  supply  have  declined.  (0021-6-3  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  In  preparing  the  draft  EIS,  monthly  groundwater-level  measurements  over  the 
period  2003-2013  from  observation  wells  located  on  Artificial  Island  were  reviewed.  These

wells,  including  those  screened  in  the  Middle  PRM  aquifer,  do  not  show  a  systematic  decline 
over  this  period.  No  change  to  the  EIS  was  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  p.  2-38,  lines  17  to  19.  The  EIS  cites  Martin  (1998)  for  the  heads  in  the  middle 
aquifer  being  about  20ft.  above  sea  level  before  pumping.  Comment:  It  should  be  noted  that 
two  wells  were  drilled  at  Artificial  Island  by  the  US  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  in  1930-1932.  The 
Historic  Well  Records  at  the  NJDEP  indicate  both  wells  were  completed  in  what  is  now  termed 
the  middle  PRM  aquifer.  Water  levels  given  for  the  well  at  the  south  end  of  Artificial  Island 
range  from  sea  level  to  4  feet,  not  the  20  feet  above  sea  level  as  the  computer  simulation 
indicated.  These  actual  measurements  agree  closely  with  the  -4  feet  measured  on  4/1/1969 
[NWSI  (USGS  392744075315301  33030-Art  Island)]  in  the  middle  PRM  at  Artificial  Island. 
Before  the  construction  began  at  Artificial  Island  there  were  no  large  regional  pumping  areas 
near  enough  to  reduce  the  heads  in  the  aquifer  at  Artificial  Island.  All  the  head  reductions  in  the 
area  were  the  result  of  the  pumping  at  the  plant  site,  nowhere  else.  (0021-1-9  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  discussion  in  EIS  Section  2.3. 1.2  of  groundwater  conditions  in  the  region 
surrounding  Artificial  Island  was  changed  to  better  describe  the  available  data  on  historic 
groundwater  levels. 

Comment:  p.  2-42,  lines  11-18.  The  EIS  discusses  the  water  levels  in  the  middle  and  lower 
PRM  aquifers  and  indicates  the  water  levels  in  these  two  aquifers  appear  to  be  affected  by  New 
Castle  County  water  withdrawals.  Comment:  The  problem  with  that  conclusion  is  that  the 
pumping  at  Artificial  Island  started  before  significant  pumping  started  in  southern  New  Castle 
County  and  caused  a  significant  lowering  of  the  potentiometric  surface  to  below  -50  feet  over 
two  miles  from  the  plant  pumping  wells  (see  Walker,  1983,  Plate  I,  wells  #33-363  and  #33-364). 
Lines  16-18,  referring  to  Plate  8,  dePaul  and  others,  (2009),  states  "The  head  measured  in  the 
USGS  observation  well  #33-934  (site  observation  Well  J)  at  the  south  end  of  Artificial  Island  was 
-70  ft,  a  drawdown  of  about  50  ft  below  the  apparent  regional  groundwater  head."  On  Plate  8, 
well  #33-934,  with  a  water  level  of  70  feet,  and  nearby  well  #33-918,  with  a  water  level  of  -44 
feet,  are  shown  as  being  in  the  middle  PRM.  This  difference  in  the  potentiometric  surface 
seems  to  account  for  the  statement  in  lines  16-18.  The  problem  with  that  conclusion  is  that  well 
#33-918  (Plate  8)  with  a  water  level  of  -44  feet  is  in  the  lower  PRM,  not  the  middle  PRM  as 
shown.  The  USGS  has  this  well  listed  in  the  wrong  aquifer  in  their  NWSI  database.  USGS  well 
#33-918  is  the  plant  production  well  PW  6  and  USGS  well  #33-458  (Plate  9)  is  observation  well 
6  (OW  6).  Plate  9  (lower  PRM)  shows  well  #33-458  with  a  water  level  of  -45  feet  very  similar  to 
well  #33-918  with  -44  feet.  Appendix  9  of  dePaul  and  others  (2009)  indicates  well  #33-458  is 
screened  at  1112-1132  feet  in  the  lower  PRM  and  Appendix  8  has  well  #33-918  screened  at 
1115-1135  feet  in  middle  PRM.  These  two  wells  are  less  than  50  feet  apart,  at  the  essentially 
the  same  depth  and  yet  the  USGS  has  these  two  wells  located  in  different  aquifers.  Note  on 
p.  2-45,  lines  8-1 1 ,  the  EIS  indicates  the  SGS  derives  its  groundwater  from  two  pumping  wells  in 
the  middle  and  lower  PRM  at  depths  of  840  and  1135  feet.  The  1135  foot  well  is  PW  6,  USGS 
well  #33-918.  If  well  #33-918  on  Plate  8  was  plotted  where  it  belongs  on  Plate  9,  then  the  data 
on  Plate  8  would  indicate  the  -70  feet  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer  is  a  more  regional  drawdown 
caused  by  the  plant,  not  a  local  deep  cone  of  drawdown  that  changes  from  -70  to  -44  feet  in  a 
short  distance.  All  the  USGS  synoptic  water  level  reports  for  the  New  Jersey  Coastal  Plain 
show  a  significant  lowering  of  the  water  levels  in  the  middle  PRM  caused  by  the  pumping  at 
Artificial  Island.  The  data  indicates  the  greatest  lowering  of  the  water  level  in  the  aquifer

occurred  in  about  1978,  which  was  likely  a  result  of  pumping  at  maximum  diversion,  during 
construction.  (0021-1-15  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  As  stated  in  Section  2.3. 1.2  of  the  EIS,  past  and  current  pumping  for  the  SGS  and 
HCGS  has  depressed  groundwater  levels  locally  and  in  the  surrounding  area.  The  influence  of 
groundwater  use  in  New  Castle  County,  Delaware,  appears  to  extend  to  the  area  of  Artificial 
Island  in  the  Lower  PRM  aquifer  and  possibly  the  Middle  PRM  aquifer.  These  two  statements 
are  not  in  conflict  and  no  change  was  made  to  the  EIS  in  response.  However,  discussion  of  the 
impact  of  SGS  and  HCGS  on  groundwater  levels  was  modified  to  reflect  the  error  in  De  Paul  et 
at  (2009),  Plate  8,  identified  in  the  comment. 

Comment:  p.  2-50,  lines  15-19.  The  EIS  indicates  that  the  chlorides  have  been  stable  over 
time  with  notable  deviations.  Comment:  Without  plotting  the  amounts  of  water  pumped  from 
each  well  on  the  Figure  2-20  it  is  difficult  to  tell  what  is  going  on,  but  there  seems  to  be  a 
correlation  that  indicates  when  the  chloride  levels  drop  in  wells  PW  5  and  PW  6  the  chloride 
levels  increase  in  HC  1  and  HC  2  with  well  HC  1  jumping  to  over  200  mg/L,  an  increase  of  an 
order  of  magnitude.  With  PW  6  the  chlorides  are  dominantly  over  200  mg/L  with  some  readings 
over  250  mg/L  the  drinking  water  standard.  It  is  likely  that  any  increased  pumpage  from  this 
well  in  lower  PRM  will  cause  the  chloride  to  exceed  the  drinking  water  standard  on  a  continuous 
basis.  Also  HC  1  shows  indications  of  possibly  exceeding  the  drinking  water  standard  if 
pumped  at  a  greater  rate  than  it  currently  being  used.  These  two  wells  are  showing  signs  being 
unsuitable  for  drinking  water  usage  with  PSEG  currently  not  pumping  the  wells  at  the  approved 
maximum  diversion  rate.  (0021-1-18  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  p.  4-24,  lines  1-20.  The  report  indicates  that  the  preconstruction  and  construction 
impacts  on  ground  water  quality  would  be  small  in  the  PRM  and  cite  Section  5. 2. 3. 2.  Comment: 
See  [our]  comment  above  for  p.  2-50,  lines  15-19  and  [our]  comments  on  Section  5. 2. 3. 2. 
(0021-2-10  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  p.  5-15,  lines  23-42  and  p.  5-16,  lines  1-17.  The  EIS  discusses  the  impact  of  the 
additional  groundwater  pumping  for  the  new  plant  on  the  potential  of  saltwater  intrusion  into  the 
middle  PRM.  On  line  30-31  they  indicate  that  Dames  and  Moore  in  1987  measured  chlorides  of 
15mg/L  (HC  1  and  HC  2)  and  45mg/L  (PW  5)  in  1987  and  in  lines  31-33  they  indicate  from  2003 
to  2013  the  median  chlorides  were  8  mg/L  (HC  1),  5  mg/L  (HC  2)  and  22  mg/L  (PW  5).  The 
report  concludes  that  the  higher  chlorides  may  have  been  due  to  the  higher  plant  pumping  rate 
of  493  gpm  (1987)  to  369  gpm  (2003-2013)  or  due  to  a  greater  regional  pumping  in  the  early 
1980's  that  was  decreased  by  the  initiation  of  Critical  Area  2.  Comment:  The  problem  with  the 
analysis  and  its  conclusions  in  this  section  is  that  by  comparing  the  median  of  the  chlorides  in 
the  wells,  biased  the  data  to  the  very  low  end,  since  the  data  not  evaluated  is  over  an  order  of 
magnitude  greater  than  the  median  chloride  concentration.  The  issue  concerning  chlorides  was 
also  discussed  above  in  comment  for  p.  2-50,  lines  15-1.  Without  having  the  amount  of  water 
pumped  from  each  of  the  wells  compared  to  the  chlorides  it  is  not  possible  to  know  why  wells 
HC  1  and  PW  5  increased  in  chloride  concentration  by  over  an  order  of  magnitude  a  number  of 
times  during  the  10  year  period  as  shown  on  Figure  2-20.  Until  it  is  known  why  these  two 
middle  PRM  wells  occasionally  increased  in  chlorides  so  dramatically  up  to  and  over  200  mg/L 
from  the  8  mg/L  (HC  1 )  and  22  mg/L  (PW  5),  the  NRC  is  only  speculating  as  to  what  would 
happen  if  the  pumpage  at  the  plant  increases.  Is  the  front  of  chlorides  over  the  drinking  water

standards  very  close  to  these  wells,  are  the  chlorides  up  coning,  or  do  the  wells  have  leaky 
casings?  Until  the  source  of  the  high  chloride  readings  in  wells  HC  1  and  PW  5  is  known,  it  is 
not  possible  to  realistically  determine  the  impact  of  the  additional  pumpage  from  a  new  plant  at 
Artificial  Island.  (0021-2-12  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  review  team  looked  at  pumping  at  the  site  and  the  observed  chloride 
concentrations,  but  did  not  see  any  noticeable  correlation.  The  review  team  also  looked  at 
available  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  National  Water  Information  System  chloride  data  from 
onsite  wells  and  the  chloride  data  provided  in  the  1988  Dames  and  Moore  report  referenced  in 
the  EIS  (see  Dames  and  Moore  1988-  TN33 1 1).  Based  on  the  history  of  groundwater  pumping 
at  the  site,  and  on  the  totality  of  the  information  examined  by  the  review  team,  it  is  expected  that 
groundwater  pumping  for  the  proposed  plant  would  have  to  be  managed  to  maintain  low 
chloride  levels.  This  conclusion  is  stated  in  the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  p.  5-9,  lines  24-26.  The  EIS  states  that  according  to  dePaul  and  others  (2009),  the 
existing  heads  in  the  middle  PRM  are  about  -20  feet  at  3  to  5  miles  northeast  of  the  site. 
Comment:  It  is  not  clear  how  they  come  to  that  conclusion  when  the  nearest  middle  PRM  wells 
shown  on  Plate  8  of  dePaul  and  others  are  about  7  and  9  miles  northeast  and  have  measured 
water  levels  of  -32  and  -31  feet  respectively.  The  nearest  wells  to  the  southwest,  west  and 
northwest  all  are  6  or  slightly  more  than  6  miles  from  the  site  and  they  have  water  levels  of  -32 
to  -34  feet.  With  the  potentiometric  surface  at  -32  feet  7  miles  from  the  PSEG  site  where  the 
potentiometric  surface  is  at  -70  feet  it  is  difficult  to  understand  how  NRC  concluded  that  the 
heads  were  about  20  feet  at  3  to  5  miles  from  the  site  without  any  other  wells  between  the  two 
measured  wells.  Well  #33-918,  on  Plate  8,  at  the  PSEG  site  has  a  measurement  of  -44  feet  but 
as  indicated  in  the  comments  above  for  p.  2-42,  lines  11-18,  well  #33-918  is  not  in  the  middle 
PRM,  but  is  in  the  lower  PRM  aquifer.  It  is  less  than  50  feet  from  well  #33-458  on  Plate  9 
(Lower  Potomac-Raritan-Magothy  Aquifer)  and  is  screened  at  almost  the  exact  same  depth,  a 
1  foot  difference  in  depth.  Even  if  this  well  was  in  the  middle  PRM  as  shown,  there  is  no 
indication  of  the  -20  foot  number  which  the  EIS  cites  from  dePaul  and  others.  If  the  14-17  feet 
of  drawdown  on  line  26  is  added  to  the  more  likely  -40  to  -45  feet  at  3  to  5  miles  based  the 
actual  information  on  Plate  8  then  the  impact  is  somewhat  greater  than  SMALL.  (0021-2-11 
[Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  p.  4-20,  lines  24-38  and  4-21 ,  lines  1-12.  The  EIS  indicates  that  the 
preconstruction  and  construction  pumping  from  the  PRM  would  be  minor  and  small.  They  cite 
Section  5. 2. 2. 2.  Comment:  There  are  significant  issues  with  Section  5. 2. 2. 2  therefore  see 
comments  below  on  that  section.  (0021-2-7  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Discussion  of  the  impact  of  groundwater  use  by  the  SGS,  the  HCGS,  and  the 
proposed  plant  on  groundwater  levels  was  modified  in  the  EIS  to  reflect  the  error  in  dePaul  et  at. 
(2009),  Plate  8,  identified  in  the  comment. 

Comment:  p.  5-16,  lines  12-17.  The  EIS  cites  Pope  and  Gordon  (1999)  to  indicate  salinity 
changes  in  the  aquifers  is  more  responsive  to  historic  sea  level  changes  than  to  20th  century 
pumpage  and  concludes  that  the  operational  impacts  of  the  increased  pumpage  at  the  plant  on 
the  resource  would  be  SMALL.  Comment:  When  Figures  If,  2f  and  3f  of  Pope  and  Gordon

(1999)  are  examined  it  is  impossible  to  locate  the  freshwater-saltwater  interface  by  the  data 
shown  on  each  figure,  let  alone  to  know  where  it  was  in  pre-pumping  times.  The  freshwater- 
saltwater  interface  is  defined  on  page  1  of  Pope  and  Gordon  "  ...as  the  hypothetical  line 
seaward  of  which  the  chloride  concentration  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  10,000  milligrams  per 
liter.”  Furthermore,  it  is  not  the  10,000  mg/L  chloride  line  that  has  the  impact,  it  is  the  250  mg/L 
chloride  drinking  water  standard  that  has  the  impact  on  the  use  of  the  resource,  so  it  does  not 
matter  how  fast  or  slow  the  10,000  line  moves.  But  it  does  matter  how  fast  the  250  mg/L  line 
moves  and  it  must  be  very  close  to  the  plant  as  evidenced  by  the  anomalous  200  mg/L  chloride 
readings  in  wells  HC  1  and  PW  5  shown  on  Figure  2-20  of  this  EIS.  (0021-2-13  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  history  of  pumping  at  the  site,  the  observed  chloride  concentrations  at  the  site 
and  in  the  region,  and  the  hydrogeological  understanding  of  the  aquifer  system  are  the  primary 
information  the  review  team  used  to  evaluate  the  potential  groundwater-quality  impacts  from  the 
proposed  plant's  groundwater  use.  The  site -specific  modeling  of  Dames  and  Moore  ( 7 988- 
TN3311)  and  the  paper  of  Pope  and  Gordon  (1999-  TN3006)  were  relied  on  as  corroborating 
evidence.  The  review  team  acknowledges  in  EIS  Section  5. 2. 3. 2  that  recent  estimates  place 
the  2 50- mg/L  line  of  equal  chloride  concentration  near  the  site  in  the  middle  PRM  aquifer.  EIS 
Section  5. 2. 3. 2  also  describes  the  evidence  the  review  team  used  in  concluding  that  salinity 
increases  at  the  site  are  likely  to  be  manageable.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were  made  in 
response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  p.  4-24,  lines  29-30.  The  EIS  indicates  the  Vincentown  is  too  saline  for  potable 
water  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  site.  The  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC,  Remedial  Action  Progress 
Report,  Third  Quarter,  2013  (dated  March  12,  2014)  shows  several  domestic  wells  within  the 
5  mile  buffer  of  the  plant  utilizing  the  Vincentown  Formation.  (0021-2-9  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  As  stated  in  the  draft  EIS,  average  chloride  concentrations  in  the  Vincentown 
aquifer  wells  completed  for  the  ESP  application  were  4, 500  mg/L  in  the  northern  wells  and 
5, 600  mg/L  in  the  eastern  wells.  In  the  potable  well  search  described  in  the  Salem  Remedial 
Action  Progress  Report,  Third  Quarter  2013,  the  closest  offsite  potable  well  described  as  being 
potentially  installed  in  the  Vincentown  aquifer  is  4  mi  from  the  SGS  and  stated  to  be  upgradient 
to  groundwater  flow.  Due  to  its  distance  from  the  site  and  the  observed  flow  in  the  Vincentown 
aquifer  toward  the  Delaware  River,  this  well  is  not  likely  to  be  affected  by  activities  at  the 
proposed  plant.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were  made  in  response  to  this  comment. 

E.2.9  Comments  Concerning  Terrestrial  Ecology  and  Wetlands 

Comment:  Before  addressing  the  new  construction,  I  would  point  out  PSEG's  past  efforts  to 
mitigate  the  effects  of  its  operations  on  the  aquatic  environment  in  the  Salem  vicinity.  In 
particular,  faced  with  concerns  of  negative  impacts  on  fisheries  by  cooling  water  intake 
operations,  PSEG  responded  with  the  largest  private  wetlands  restoration  project  in  the  Nation. 
The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  began  in  1994  and  since  that  time  has  been  a  large  scale 
effort  to  restore  and  preserve  portions  of  the  Delaware  Estuary  in  both  New  Jersey  and 
Delaware.  PSEG  has  restored,  enhanced,  and/or  preserved  more  than  20,000  acres  of  salt 
marsh  and  adjacent  uplands  to  vital,  healthy  habitat  for  fish  and  wildlife.  (0001-4  [Velinsky,  David])

Comment:  Before  addressing  this  new  construction,  I  would  like  to  point  out  that  PSEG's  past 
efforts  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  the  operations  on  the  aquatic  environment  in  the  Salem  vicinity. 
And  particularly  faced  with  concerns  of  negative  impacts  on  fisheries,  by  cooling  water  intake 
operations,  PSEG  responded  with  the  largest  private  wetlands  restoration  project  in  the  nation. 
The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  began  ini 994  and  since  that  time  has  been  a  large  scale

Delaware.  PSEG  has  restored,  enhanced  and/or  preserved  more  than  20,000  acres  of  salt 
marsh,  and  adjacent  wetlands  to  vital  healthy  habitat  for  fish  and  wildlife.  (0004-11-4  [Velinsky, 
David]) 

Comment:  During  the  re-permitting,  of  the  existing  nuclear  facilities  at  Salem,  PSEG 
developed  a  bay-wide  concept  of  mitigating  the  impacts  of  the  existing  cooling  apparatus  at  the 
facilities.  They  were  creative  in  identifying  a  variety  of  ways  that  the  bay-wide  resource  value 
could  be  improved  through  investment  in  projects,  throughout  the  Delaware  Bay  estuary.  I  was 
impressed  by  the  scope  of  their  thinking,  and  the  resources  they  could  bring  to  the  table.  (0004- 
4-4  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  Since  then  I  have  followed,  with  my  students  and  with  great  interest,  what  has 
become  the  largest  privately  financed  estuary  enhancement  project  in  the  nation.  Without  going 
into  details  the  project  has  been  a  resounding  success,  at  many  levels,  and  increasing  the 
resource  value  of  large  acreages  throughout  the  bay.  PSEG  has  a  solid  track  record  in 
delivering  on  their  commitment  to  bay-wide  health.  (0004-4-5  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  Before  addressing  the  new  construction  I  would  point  out  PSEG's  past  efforts  to 
mitigate  the  effects  of  its  operations  on  aquatic  environments  in  the  Salem  vicinity.  In  particular 
faced  with  concerns  of  negative  impacts  on  fisheries,  by  cooling  water  intake  operations,  PSEG 
responded  with  the  largest  private  wetlands  restoration  project  in  the  nation.  This  project,  the 
Estuary  Enhancement  Program,  began  in  1994.  Since  that  time  it  has  conducted  a  large  scale 
effort  to  restore  and  preserve  portions  of  the  Delaware  estuary,  of  wetlands  in  the  Delaware 
estuary,  in  both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  PSEG  has  restored,  enhanced  and/or  preserved 
more  than  20,000  acres  of  salt  marsh,  returning  it  to  vital  healthy  habitat  for  fish  and  wildlife. 
(0007-9-4  [Wall,  Roland]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  PSEG's  EEP  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the 
existing  environment.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  PSEG  is  making  acceptable  efforts  to  restrict  impact  on  these  wetlands,  including  a 
site  plan  to  minimize  encroachment,  the  use  of  sediment  pits  to  stage  some  of  the  construction 
operations,  and  the  use  of  raised  causeways,  rather  than  using  fill  material  to  carry  the  access 
road  to  the  new  site.  Where  permanent  disturbance  to  wetland  occurs,  PSEG  has  outlined  a 
mitigation  plan  that  would  create  new  wetland  environments  in  adequate  amounts  to  offset  any 
loss.  We  anticipate  that  the  resources  and  expertise  developed  in  the  EEP  will  provide  a  very 
strong  foundation  for  the  mitigation  steps  being  taken  by  PSEG  in  the  new  site  construction, 
both  in  selecting  the  mitigation  sites  and  in  managing  the  restored  and  enhanced  wetland  sites.

Comment:  PSEG  has  already  demonstrated  their  ability,  and  willingness,  to  engage  in 
environmental  mitigation  activities,  as  demonstrated  by  their  marsh  restoration  program.  Every 
indication  points  to  PSEG's  commitment  to  mitigating  any  marsh  disturbance  associated  with 
the  construction  of  a  new  plant.  (0006-8-9  [Duvau,  Bryan]) 

Comment:  The  20,000  acre  restoration  program  instituted  by  PS&G  in  the  greater  area  has 
provided  added  benefit  to  the  recovery  of  nearby  wetlands,  an  internationally  recognized 
success.  Plans  appear  to  be  in  place  to  expand  the  restoration  program  to  continue  to  benefit 
the  area.  (0009-4  [Locandro,  Roger])

Comment:  But  there  is  also  a  renewed  emphasis  on  the  role  of  wetlands  that  has  taken  center 
stage  in  efforts  to  build  a  climate  resilient  nation;  they  do  this  by  helping  to  protect  people, 
property  and  the  environment  against  the  ravages  of  severe  storms.  (0002-1  [Weinstein,  Michael])

a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Thus,  long  after  these  Artificial  Island  power  plants  and  their  infrastructure  are 
gone,  EEP's  wetlands  will  continue  to  serve  both  of  these  critical  ecological  and  societal 
functions,  and  not  only  produce  fish  and  shellfish  of  the  "right  kind",  in  copious  numbers,  but  will 
also  help  protect  people  and  property  in  the  region  against  storm  related  impacts.  (0002-5

critical  ecological  and  societal  functions.  And  not  only  produce  fish  and  shellfish  of  the  right 
kind,  but  in  copious  numbers.  It  will  also  help  protect  people  and  property  in  the  region,  again, 
against  the  advent  of  more  severe  storm  events.  (0004-9-6  [Weinstein,  Michael])

Comment:  So  .  .  .  Why  am  I  saying  all  of  this  today?  It  is  because  the  newly  proposed  project 
will  result  in  the  unavoidable  loss  of  108  acres  of  Phragmites-dovninated  wetlands  and  will 
require  mitigation  in  some  form.  (0002-6  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  the  loss  of  Phragmites-dominated  wetlands  in  Section  4. 3 
of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion  on  ecological  impacts  of  construction.  The  NRC  staff  also 
discusses  wetlands  and  wetlands  mitigation  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion 
on  ecological  impacts  of  preconstruction/construction.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  I  am  absolutely  certain  that  a  satisfactory  effort  to  replace  these  lost  wetlands  will 
be  undertaken  by  the  Company  to  the  vast  satisfaction  of  the  majority  of  the  public,  resource 
and  regulatory  agencies,  both  Federal  and  State,  and  a  broad  array  of  decision  makers.  They 
have  done  this  admirably  before,  involving  a  multidisciplinary  group  of  the  nation's  best 
scientists,  and  quality  engineers  to  design  and  implement  their  marsh  restoration  plan.  I  see  no 
reason  that  they  will  not  do  the  same  again,  inviting  in  the  top  technical  talent  to  achieve  their 
mitigation  objectives.  (0002-8  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Comment:  I'm  absolutely  certain  that  a  satisfactory  effort  to  replace  these  lost  wetlands,  will  be

They  have  done  this  admirably  before,  involving  a  multi-disciplinary  group  of  the  nation's  best

talent  to  achieve  their  mitigation  objectives.  (0004-9-9  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Comment:  There  are  other  examples,  as  well.  They  have  a  lot  of  expertise  in  mitigating 
impacts  of  their  activities  on  the  environment.  Some  of  the  best  practices  for  restoring  wetlands 
came  out  of  their  Estuary  Enhancement  Program.  And  it  is,  certainly,  a  model  for  a  lot  of  the 
restoration  that  is  under  way  now,  in  the  aftermath  of  superstorm  Sandy.  So  I'm  very  confident 
that  PSEG  is  up  to  the  task  of  addressing  and  mitigating  the  impacts  of  this  particular  project. 
(0006-6-4  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Comment:  Because  there  is  going  to  be  some  impact  on  the  meadow  [from  the  causeway], 
you  are  going  to  lose  certain  acreage.  And  their  plans  are  to  enhance  an  area  presently  owned 
by  the  division,  or  I  should  say,  managed  by  the  New  Jersey  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife.  And 
this  area  is  over  near  Mason's  Point,  and  Abbot's  Farm  road.  Their  plan  is  to  mitigate  that  area 
by  enhancing  the  area,  much  as  was  talked  about,  by  the  last  speaker,  similar  to  what  they  did 
with  their  Estuary  Enhancement  Program.  (0006-7-4  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Comment:  The  Environmental  Report  indicates  an  overall  wetlands  impact  of  229  acres  from 
the  new  plant,  and  proposed  causeway.  It  further  indicated  that  there  is  an  abundance  of 
wetlands  in  the  vicinity,  of  more  than  25,000  acres.  Unfortunately  the  quality,  and  the  dominant 
species  is  the  invasive  species  phragmites.  PSEG  will  reduce  the  environmental  impact  by 
replacing  permanent  facilities,  inside  the  current  diked  areas,  and  in  compensation  free 
wetlands.  We  recommend  that  Public  Service  continue  to  restore  the  degraded  wetlands  in  the 
Delaware  Bay  region,  by  appropriate  compensation  ratio.  This  could  be  achieved  by

undertaking  and  furthering  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  that  has  been  recognized, 
nationally,  for  restoring  and  protecting  over  20,000  wetlands  of  adjoining  properties  on  the 
estuary  of  both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  (0007-16-7  [Palmer,  Dennis]) 

Comment:  In  addition  to  the  storm  surge  we  are  --  we  continue  to  be  concerned  about 
wetlands.  You  know,  there  is  a  trade,  kind  of  a  sweetheart  swapping  deal  being  proposed,  with 
some  core  lands.  I  bet  guessed  on  appraised  value.  But  we  knew,  from  federal  actions  here  in 
Delaware,  that  beyond  the  value,  the  land  values  of  wetlands,  we  put  a  higher  premium  on 
them.  We  are  spending  40  million  dollars  to  try  to  restore  and  protect  1 00  acres  of  wetlands  in 
prime  hook  area,  going  through  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service.  I  think  we  need  to  put  similar 
values  on  this  type  of  wetlands.  (0007-2-10  [Carter,  David])

Comment:  The  proposed  new  construction  will  permanently  impact  some  wetlands.  While 
protection  of  wetlands  is  a  high  national  priority  (as  demonstrated  by  Section  404  of  the  Clean 
Water  Act),  the  majority  of  the  wetland  acreage  impacted  by  the  new  construction  has  a 
degraded  hydroperiod  and  now  hosts  a  monoculture  of  Phragmites.  An  invasive  reed  grass, 
Phragmites  is  often  found  in  disturbed  marsh  areas,  where  plant  communities,  hydrology  and 
topography  have  been  altered.  Phragmites  displaces  native  plants  and  has  a  negative  impact 
on  biodiversity.  Targeting  these  degraded  wetlands  in  close  proximity  to  existing  PSEG  facilities 
will  reduce  the  need  for  new  infrastructure,  minimizing  the  environmental  disturbance  that  would 
result  if  development  occurred  in  "Greenfield"  sites.  Moreover,  the  amount  of  wetlands 
impacted  represents  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  wetland  -  many  with  higher  quality  functions  - 
present  in  the  vicinity  of  the  construction.  (0001-6  [Velinsky,  David])

and  has  a  negative  impact  on  biodiversity.  By  converting  these  already  degraded  wetlands  that 
are  in  close  proximity  to  existing  PSEG  facilities,  it  will  reduce  the  need  for  new  infrastructure, 
minimizing  the  environmental  disturbance  that  would  result  if  development  occurred  in  green 
field  sites.  Moreover,  the  amount  of  wetlands  impacted  represents  a  small  fraction  of  the  total 
wetland  in  the  vicinity  of  the  construction.  And  many  of  these  remain  unaltered  and  have  higher 
quality  functions.  (0007-9-6  [Wall,  Roland]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetlands,  wetlands  loss,  the  small  percentage  of 
wetlands  that  would  be  disturbed  in  relation  to  acreages  available  in  the  vicinity,  wetlands 
mitigation,  and  the  negative  attributes  of  Phragmites-dominated  wetlands  in  Section  4.3  of  the 
EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion  on  ecological  impacts  of  preconstruction/construction.  The  NRC 
staff  discusses  CWA  Section  404  in  Chapters  4  and  5  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  impacts  of 
preconstruction/construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  site.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  PSEG  is  making  acceptable  efforts  to  restrict  impacting  these  wetlands,  including  a 
site  plan  to  minimize  encroachment,  the  use  of  sediment  pits  to  stage  some  of  the  construction 
operations,  the  use  of  a  raised  causeway,  rather  than  using  fill  material  to  carry  the  access  road 
to  the  new  site.  While  permanent  disturbance,  to  wetlands,  occurs  PSEG  has  outlined 
mitigation  plan  that  would  create  new  wetland  environments  in  adequate  amounts  to  offset  the 
loss.  We  anticipate  that  the  resources,  and  expertise  developed  in  the  EEP  will  provide  a  strong 
foundation  for  the  mitigation  steps  taken  by  PSEG,  in  the  new  site  construction.  Both  in

Comment:  New  improvements,  such  as  roadways,  should  be  carefully  placed  and  designed  to 
minimize  their  impact  on  marshlands.  An  elevated  road  system  would  be  a  design  that  would 
help  minimize  these  impacts.  We  encourage,  PSEG,  to  pursue  such  a  design,  and  develop  a 
comprehensive  wetlands  mitigation,  and  compensation  plan  for  these  impacts.  (0004-16-10

Comment:  From  the  information  in  the  DEIS,  it  appears  that  PSEG  proposes  to  construct 
portions  of  the  project,  including  the  causeway,  on  lands  owned  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and 
protected  by  deed  restrictions.  We  do  not  support  the  diversion  of  State-owned  wildlife 
management  areas  for  development  activities.  These  areas  are  protected  and  managed  due  to 
their  high  ecological  value.  Wetlands  fill  and  other  construction  activities  on  these  protected 
areas  can  affect  the  entire  wildlife  management  area  adversely  due  to  habitat  loss,  hydrologic 
modifications,  and  increases  in  human  activity  and  storm  water  runoff.  (0018-1-6  [Chiarella, 

Louis]) 

Comment:  The  DEIS  ignores  any  discussion  of  justified  need  for  the  causeway  which  should 
be  discussed  and  evaluated.  DRN  can  identify  no  justified  need  for  this  causeway  and  the 
resulting  effective  elimination  of  productive  wetlands  and  "protected"  wildlife  areas.  DRN 
strongly  opposes  any  lifting  of  these  deed  restrictions  by  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  since  it  will 
fragment  existing  productive  wetlands  and  the  replacement  lands  may  not  be  worthy  of 
acquisition  by  the  State.  (0020-4-9  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetlands,  wetlands  loss,  and  wetlands  mitigation  in 
Section  4. 3  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion  on  ecological  impacts  of

Comment:  Returning  to  the  purpose  of  this  meeting,  should  this  project  move  ahead  toward 
construction,  there  will  be  on  site  habitat  impacts  that  will  be  unavoidable.  And  I  urge  that  the 
process  to  embrace  the  same  bay-wide  approach  used  in  the  estuarian  enhancement  program, 
and  to  be  creative  and  aggressive  in  identifying  off-site  mitigation  opportunities.  Hold  PSEG's 
feet  to  the  fire.  History  suggests  that  they  will  deliver.  (0004-4-7  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  PSEG's  environmental  policy  actions  over  20 
years,  and  the  restoration  and  mitigation  activities  in  support  of  the  environment.  I  know  of  no 
company  that  has  such  a  stellar  environmental  record,  well  beyond  what  has  been  required  of 
them.  Their  environmental  restoration  activities  are  a  model  for  other  states,  and  other 
countries.  And  I  have  read  the  Environmental  Report,  and  given  what  I  know  about  their  past 
performance,  in  habitat  enhancement,  I'm  confident  that  PSEG  will  carry  out  their  plans  and 
create  much  more  habitat  than  is  compromised  by  the  new  development.  Further,  the  land  that 
will  be  used  for  siting  the  new  facility  is  not  currently  natural  high  quality  habitat.  But  it  is  already 
degraded.  But,  in  contrast,  I  feel  confidence  that  the  mitigation  habitat  will  be  functioning  high 
quality  habitat.  I  encourage  the  NRC  to  approve  the  Early  Site  Permit  and  lend  my  support  to 
PSEG  for  its  community  minded  ecosystem  conscious  approach  to  restoration  and  mitigation.

Comment:  Much  of  the  land  that  will  be  used  for  site  construction,  of  the  new  nuclear  facility  is

Comment:  Their  mitigation  efforts  include  a  mitigation  plan  that  has  identified  compensatory 
lands  that  could  offset  some  of  the  impacts  to  wetlands,  including  candidate  areas  in  portions  of 
the  existing  PSEG  site  Mannington  Meadows,  Mason's  Point,  and  the  additional  areas  of  the 
company's  Alloway  Creek  restoration  site.  These  habitats  will  be  greatly  improved  by  PSEG's 
mitigation  work.  And  the  restored  habitat  will  provide  much  higher  quality  than  is  even  possible 
with  the  plant,  at  the  plant  construction  site.  The  natural  tidal  flows,  in  the  planned  restoration 
and  mitigation  habitat,  will  lead  to  habitat  with  far  greater  wildlife  use,  and  ecosystem  integrity. 
This  part  of  the  Delaware  Bay  ecosystem  will  be  greatly  aided  by  the  restoration  plan  by  PSEG 
(0004-5-4  [Burger,  Joanna]) 

Comment:  If  it  is  done  it  will  be  beneficial  to  both  the  wildlife,  as  well  as  the  community.  In  fact, 
the  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife,  back  around  2002,  had  a  proposal  to  actually  do  some  of  this 
same  work.  (0006-7-7  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland  mitigation  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the 
discussion  on  ecological  impacts  of  preconstruction/construction.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  environmental  plan  they  present  is  sound,  well  thought  out,  and  sufficiently 
developed  to  ensure  that  it  can  be  accomplished.  The  environmental  report  is  extensive, 
comprehensive,  and  devotes  considerable  attention,  not  only  to  the  environment,  physical  and 
ecosystem  issues,  but  to  appropriate  public  involvement  and  to  monitoring.  As  an  ecologist  I 
have  been  impressed  with  their  due  diligence  in  addressing  all  the  outstanding  environmental 
issues,  and  goes  well  beyond  what  is  necessary  in  terms  of  mitigation  and  restoration  of 
additional  habitat.  The  State  of  New  Jersey  will  be  gaining  considerable  high  quality  habitat  by 
these  actions,  in  exchange  for  degraded,  low  quality,  phragmites  marsh,  that  is  on  the  current 
site.  (0004-5-5  [Burger,  Joanna]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  the  negative  attributes  of  Phragmites-dominated  wetlands 
and  wetlands  mitigation  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion  on  ecological  impacts 
of  construction.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  plans,  proposed  by  PSEG,  can  be  viewed  in  light  of  their  past  mitigation,  and 
restoration  activities.  They  have  one  of  the  largest  and  most  successful  mitigation  projects  in 
the  country,  where  they  control  phragmites  to  produce  high  quality  salt  marsh  with  its  attendant 
mud  flats  and  inter-tidal  habitat  that  is  used  extensively  by  thousands  of  shore  birds,  and  other 
species.  Thus  their  estuary  enhancement  program  is  one  of  the  most  successful  in  the  country, 
has  received  a  variety  of  state  and  national  awards.  And  unlike  many  such  programs,  it  is 
sustainable.  Thus  it  is  my  professional  opinion  that  they  are  capable  of  and  will  deliver  on  their

environmental  mitigation  and  restoration  plans.  The  company's  integrity,  and  environmental 
vision,  to  ensure  that  there  is  little  environmental  impact,  and  that  the  restoration  and  mitigation 
plans  will  result  in  a  far  more  high  quality  habitat  than  is  presently  on  that  site.  (0004-5-6  [Burger, 
Joanna]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  PSEG's  EEP  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the 
existing  environment.  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetlands,  wetlands  loss,  wetlands  mitigation, 
and  the  negative  attributes  of  Phragmites-dominated  wetlands  in  Section  4. 3  of  the  EIS  as  part 
of  the  discussion  on  ecological  impacts  of  preconstruction/construction.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  Environmental  Report  indicates  an  overall  wetlands  impact  of  229  acres  from 
the  new  plant,  and  the  proposed  causeway.  It  is  further  indicated  that  there  is  an  abundance  of 
wetlands,  in  the  vicinity,  locating  -  totaling  more  than  25,000  acres.  And  the  quality  of  the 
dominant  species,  as  we  heard,  is  invasive  phragmites.  PSEG  would  reduce  environmental 
impacts  by  placing  permanent  facilities  inside  currently  diked  areas  in  compensation  for  use  of 
these  wetlands.  We  would  recommend  that  PSEG  create  or  restore,  degraded  wetlands  within 
the  Delaware  Bay  region,  at  an  appropriate  compensation  ratio.  This  should  also  be 
achievable,  this  should  be  an  achievable  undertaking,  by  PSEG,  as  their  Estuary  Enhancement 
Program  has  been  recognized  nationally,  for  restoring  and  protecting  over  20,000  acres  of 
wetlands.  And  we  have  heard  quite  bit  about  that.  (0004-16-8  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  PSEG's  EEP  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the

discusses  the  small  percentage  of  wetlands  that  would  be  disturbed  in  relation  to  acreages 
available  in  the  vicinity  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion  on  ecological  impacts 
of  preconstruction/construction.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  [W]hy  have  I  said  all  of  this?  The  proposed  project  will  result  in  the  unavoidable  loss 
of  about  1 00  acres  of  phragmites  dominated  wetlands,  that  will  require  mitigation  in  some  form. 
(0004-9-7  [Weinstein,  Michael])

preconstruction/construction.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  One  of  the  things  about  this  project,  that  caught  my  attention,  was  the  fact  that  they 
are  going  to  plan  to  use  an  elevated  roadway  to  access  the  nuclear  plant.  In  the  past  what 
people  did  was  build  up  a  roadway  across  the  meadow.  And  that  would  involve,  literally,  tons 
and  tons  of  fill,  and  emplacement  of  culverts  and  bridges.  The  intent  was  to  get  the  vehicles  in 
and  out,  without  being  flooded  out  by  high  tide.  The  problem  with  that  is  that,  even  though,  you 
haven’t  technically  altered  the  marsh,  other  than  that  which  is  underneath  the  footprint,  in  reality 
you  have  restricted  the  tidal  flow.  And  once  you  restrict  the  tidal  flow  the  area  no  longer 
functions  as  the  same  type  of  marsh  that  it  once  was.  This  enables  it  to  be  more  attractive  to 
invasive  plants,  such  as  phragmites,  also  known  as  common  reed  in  this  area.  And,  at  the

Appendix  E 


same  time,  it  reduces  the  amount  of  flow,  and  that  means  that  there  is  less  fish  using  the  marsh. 
Today  we  have  another  alternative,  and  that  is  the  elevated  roadway.  The  one  that  PSEG  has 
proposed  is  going  to  be,  at  least,  ten  feet  above  the  surface  of  the  marsh.  By  doing  this  it  is 
going  to,  one,  not  impact  the  marsh  except  where  the  piers  come  into  the  marsh  itself.  The  fact 
that  it  is  ten  feet  above  will  also  reduce  the  amount  of  shading  that  comes  on,  underneath.  And 
thus  not  inhibit  the  growth  of  plants.  When  you  get  big  tides,  or  even  just  the  tide  that  you  get 
during  the  normal  full  moon,  you  are  going  to  have  water  flowing  all  the  way  across  that  area. 
But  it  will  be  underneath  the  roadway,  and  it  will  not  be  blocked  by  the  roadway  itself.  With  that 
you  are  going  to  have  a  much  better  situation,  you  will  be  able  to  get  vehicles  in  and  out.  And, 
at  the  same  time,  you  will  not  have  a  major  impact  on  the  meadow.  (0006-7-2  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Comment:  Also,  the  road  system  being  elevated  is  also  designed  to  minimize  impacts.  (0007- 
16-9  [Palmer,  Dennis]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  minimizing  impacts  by  using  a  raised  causeway  in 
Section  4.3  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion  on  ecological  impacts  of 
preconstruction/construction.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  As  described,  in  the  Draft  EIS,  the  size  of  a  wind  farm  needed  to  equal  the  electrical 
output  of  the  proposed  nuclear  plant,  would  have  3,300  large  scale  turbines,  occupying  a  land 
mass  of  386,000  acres,  or  620  square  miles.  Similarly  a  photovoltaic  solar  installation  would 
need  to  occupy  between  1 1 ,000  and  22,000  acres,  or  over  30  square  miles.  This  extensive 
land  area  would  be  necessary  due  to  the  low  energy  density,  and  intermittency,  inherent  in  wind 
and  solar  generation.  The  impacts  to  the  regional  and  migratory  bird  and  bat  populations,  from 
this  scale,  of  renewable  development,  would  be  significant.  There  is  a  growing  body  of 
evidence,  and  peer  reviewed  research,  that  existing  large  scale  wind  farms  are  killing  increasing 
numbers  of  raptors,  and  other  bird  species,  due  to  collisions  with  turbine  tower  and  blade 
impacts.  Wind  turbines  have  also  been  shown  to  attract  and  kill  regional  bats  thus  impacting 
already  declining  bat  populations.  Not  only  are  bats  physically  impacted  by  the  rotation  of  the 
massive  spinning  turbine  blades,  it  has  been  shown  that  their  lungs  are  violently  ruptured  when 
they  fly  through  the  large  pressure  drop  produced  by  wind  turbines.  Large  scale  wind  farms 
have  also  been  shown  to  negatively  affect  migratory  patterns  of  avian  species,  due  to  the 
extensive  land  masses  required  to  generate  meaningful  amounts  of  electricity.  (0006-9-3  [Wiwel,

that  their  lungs  are  violently  ruptured  when  they  fly  through  the  large  pressure  drop  produced  by

Comment:  What  we  have  seen,  in  the  early  days,  of  much  of  the  renewables  for  wind,  they 
place  them  in  the  wrong  places,  particularly  out  in  the  Midwest.  We  had  some  areas  where 
eagles  have  been  hit  pretty  hard.  I  think  we  have  learned  a  fair  amount  about  that.  I'm  very 
aware  of  the  bat  issue.  And  I'm  delighted  to  say  that  our  own  researchers,  here  in  Delaware,  at 
the  University  of  Delaware,  largely  led  by  some  graduate  students,  and  some  others,  have 
found  a  good  solution  that  bat  issue.  What  they  have  found  is  that  those  strikes  occur  during 
low  wind  areas.  That  fast  winds  the  bats  avoid  them.  So  we  are  learning.  (0008-8-4  [Carter, 
David]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  potential  impacts  of  wind  turbines  on  bird  and  bat 
populations  in  Section  9.2  (energy  alternatives)  of  the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS 
as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  We  can  make  plans  about  mitigation.  I  actually  was  involved  in  a  fair  amount  of  the 
[wetlands]  restoration  work  using  some  of  the  mitigation  summit  funds  from  PSEG. 
Unfortunately,  with  sea  level  rise,  I  think  that  most  of  those  sites  are  now  going  to  be  lost  and 
drowned,  over  the  next  30  or  40  years,  due  to  sea  level  rise.  So  mitigation  has  further  issues. 
And  in  addition  to  your  storm  surge  modeling  with  accurate  numbers,  I  think  you  need  to  get 
together  with  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  or  someone,  and  do  some  sea  level  rise  effects  on 
marsh  management,  and  some  of  the  other  models,  to  look  at  what  the  likely  habitat  impacts 
are.  (0007-2-12  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  Furthermore,  this  assessment  does  not  take  into  account  the  trend  of  extensive 
wetland  losses  in  the  watershed  along  with  the  impact  of  sea  level  rise  on  wetland  losses  in  the 
near  future.  For  this  reason,  the  proposed  project  results  in  unacceptable  permanent  impacts  to 
critical  wetlands,  and  the  NRC  should  not  issue  the  ESP  or  authorize  activities  which  would 
have  such  detrimental  impacts  to  wetland  resources.  (0020-2-7  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetlands  and  wetlands  mitigation  in  Section  4.2  of  the 
EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion  on  ecological  impacts  of  preconstruction/construction.  The  NRC 
staff  discusses  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  and  sea-level  rise  on  ecological 
resources  in  Section  7. 3  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion  on  cumulative  impacts.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  natural  systems  of  the  Delaware  River  and  estuary  are  critical  environments 
with  major  significance  for  both  regional  and  global  biodiversity,  for  regional  water  supply,  and 
water  quality,  and  for  supporting  important  economic  activities.  Construction  on  the  scale 
proposed  by  PSEG  on  the  Delaware  coast  requires  careful  consideration  of  the  environmental 
factors.  (0007-9-3  [Wall,  Roland])

Comment:  This  project  will  fill  in  1 08  acres  of  wetlands,  a  loss  of  40  acres  of  ponds,  and  9,585 
feet  of  creek  channel.  We  believe  they  need  to  look  at  the  secondary  and  cumulative  impacts  of

Comment:  The  proposal  results  in  unacceptable  permanent  and  temporary  impacts  to 
wetlands.  Generally,  the  only  way  to  adequately  protect  aquatic  resources  is  to  avoid  impacting 
them  in  the  first  place.  Constructing  upon  such  a  large  acreage  of  wetlands  in  the  Delaware 
estuary  will  contribute  to  the  decline  in  wetland  resources.  (0022-3  [Butch,  Kerry  Margaret]  [King,

Comment:  Impact  to  wetlands--the  Permanent  Fill  of  1 08  acres  of  wetlands,  plus  an  additional 
23  wetlands  acres  filled  for  the  proposed  causeway,  equaling  131  acres  permanently  filled 
wetlands.  This  is  a  significant  impact  to  our  diminishing  coastal  wetlands  and  the  animals  and 
plants  that  live  there.  52  additional  acres  would  be  impacted  during  construction,  which  may 
never  be  fully  recovered  due  to  soil  disturbance  and  habitat  destruction.  (0032-1  [Purcell,  Leslie])

Comment:  There  is  limited  discussion  and  analysis  of  avoidance/  minimization  measures. 
Avoidance/  minimization  should  be  explicit  and  carried  out  in  a  way  that  compensatory 
mitigation  is  only  used  as  a  last  case  resort,  and  the  avoidance/minimization  measures  should 
be  the  subject  of  public  review  and  comment.  Furthermore,  the  analysis  of  compensatory 
actions  is  inadequate  without  knowing  what  actions  are  actually  being  implemented  to  avoid  or 
minimize  impacts.  (0034-5  [Carter,  David]  [DePaul,  Shelly]  [Furst,  Charles]  [Hvozdovich,  Steve]

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland  impacts  and  potential  mitigation  activities  in 
Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  Most  of  the  wetlands  that  would  be  impacted  are  dominated  by  near 
monocultures  of  common  reed  (Phragmites  australis),  a  nonnative  aggressive  invasive  plant 
species  that  significantly  impacts  wetland  diversity  and  habitat  structure  with  resultant  significant 
impacts  to  wildlife  habitat  quality.  However,  as  noted  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS  alterations  to

Comment:  As  part  of  the  project,  it  is  proposed  that  a  publicly  owned  dredge  disposal  area 
near  the  existing  Artificial  Island  be  swapped  for  land  in  the  upper  river  reach,  potentially  leading 
to  inadequate  long  term  options  for  dredged  disposal  in  the  Delaware  City/Listen  Point  Reach. 
The  proposal  is  for  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  to  give  PSEG  acres  of  federally  owned  area, 
(primarily  wetlands)  in  exchange.  This  may  impact  new  natural  areas  or  lead  to  the  need  for 
disposal  areas  along  the  C&D  canal  to  be  refurbished  and  utilized  in  conflict  with  ongoing

Dredge  disposal  needs  of  the  USACE  are  determined  by  that  agency.  An  independent  EA  is 
being  prepared  by  USACE  for  the  land  exchange  with  PSEG  that  will  address  these  long-term 
dredge  disposal  needs  and  impacts  resulting  from  the  land  exchange. 

No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  DEIS  underestimates  the  permanent  impacts  to  wetlands  because  the 
determination  of  the  impacted  wetlands  as  low  quality  is  not  based  on  the  best  science 
available.  The  EIS  declares  that  M[t]he  quality  of  the  habitat  provided  by  wetlands  at  the  [PSEG] 
site  is  impacted  by  the  fact  that  much  of  the  area  is  dominated  by  the  invasive  common  read 
(Phragmites  australis)"  (p.  4-41 ).  Asserting  as  a  justification  for  the  impacts  that  the  Phragmities 
dominated  wetlands  are  degraded  and  their  ruination  is  somehow  less  impactful  or  harmful  to

Comment:  Furthermore,  the  unsubstantiated  assumption  that  converting  a  Phragmities 
dominated  wetland  to  a  Spartina  alterniflora  wetland  will  enhance  the  ecological  value  of 
proposed  mitigation  sites  is  also  faulty.  This  false  assumption  makes  the  evaluation  of  the 
proposed  project  inadequate,  and  also  influences  the  evaluation  of  mitigation  measures.  (0020- 
2-13  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  NRC  asserts  as  justification  that  Phragmites  dominated  wetlands  are  degraded 
and  their  ruination  is  somehow  less  impactful  but  this  perspective  is  not  supported  by  the 
science.  Furthermore,  the  unsubstantiated  assumption  that  converting  a  Phragmites  dominated 
wetland  to  a  Spartina  alterniflora  wetland  will  enhance  the  ecological  value  of  the  proposed 
mitigation  sites  is  also  faulty.  This  false  assumption  makes  the  evaluation  of  the  proposed 
project  inadequate,  and  also  influences  the  evaluation  of  mitigation  measures.  PSEG's  own 
data,  as  well  as  research  by  others,  demonstrates  this  to  be  false  and  that  Phragmites- 
dominated  wetlands  are  usable  and  used  by  a  variety  of  species.  (0022-5  [Butch,  Kerry

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wildlife  that  may  frequent  the  PSEG  Site  in  Section  2.4  of 
the  EIS.  It  is  acknowledged  in  that  section  that  certain  wildlife  species  will  utilize  Phragmites- 
dominated  wetlands  (e.g.,  northern  harrier,  black-crowned  night-heron,  red-winged  blackbird, 
and  marsh  wren).  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland  impacts  and  potential  mitigation  activities  in 
Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  Section  4.3  includes  a  discussion  of  potential  impacts  on  wildlife 
populations  due  to  habitat  loss,  including  loss  of  wetlands.  It  is  acknowledged  in  this  section 
that  certain  wildlife  species  will  be  impacted  by  the  loss  of  Phragmites-dominated  wetlands 
(e.g.,  northern  harrier).  The  NRC  staff  has  reviewed  the  information  provided  by  the 
commenters.  However,  current  literature  indicates  that  monocultures  of  Phragmites-dominated 
wetlands  are  generally  not  considered  to  be  of  high  quality  and  offer  less  value  to  terrestrial  and 
aquatic  resources  than  other  wetland  types.  As  noted  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS,  alterations  to 
these  wetlands  were  considered  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing.  USACE  will  include  further 
efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable  impacts.  That  process  will 
conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a  statement  of  findings

addressing  public  interest.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section  404(b)(1)  guidelines. 
No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  review  of  mitigation  measures  is  based  on  insufficient  information  due  to  the 
lack  of  detail  and  use  of  qualifying  language.  More  information  is  necessary  in  order  to  make  an 
informed  decision.  Potential  mitigation  measures  for  unavoidable  and  permanent  impact  to 
wetland  resources  is  discussed  in  Section  4. 3. 2. 2.  However,  the  description  is  vague  and  uses 
qualifying  language  such  as  "may  include,"  "could  include,"  or  "could  be  undertaken."  The 
mitigation  plans  should  be  explicitly  developed  and  evaluated,  especially  given  the  likelihood  for 
adverse  impacts  that  some  of  the  "potential"  mitigation  methods  could  have  on  the  local 
environment  (i.e.  herbicide  use).  (0020-2-19  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  There  is  limited  discussion  and  analysis  of  avoidance/  minimization  measures. 
Avoidance/  minimization  should  be  explicit  and  carried  out  in  a  way  that  compensatory 
mitigation  is  only  used  as  a  last  case  resort,  and  the  avoidance/minimization  measures  should 
be  the  subject  of  public  review  and  comment.  Furthermore,  the  analysis  of  compensatory 
actions  is  inadequate  without  knowing  what  actions  are  actually  being  implemented  to  avoid  or 
minimize  impacts.  (0022-4  [Butch,  Kerry  Margaret]  [King,  Charlotte]  [Pryde,  Coralie]) 

Comment:  The  description  of  potential  mitigation  measures  is  vague.  The  mitigation  plans 
should  be  explicitly  developed  and  evaluated,  especially  given  the  likelihood  for  adverse 
impacts  that  some  of  the  "potential"  mitigation  methods  could  have  on  the  local  environment 
(i.e.  herbicide  use).  Furthermore,  mitigation  methods  should  be  the  subject  of  public  review  and 
comment.  Wetlands  are  an  important  terrestrial  resource  and  provide  habitat  for  wildlife  in  the 
Delaware  River  watershed.  It  is  imperative  that  any  impacts  to  these  important  resources  are 
mitigated  appropriately  and  that  an  approved  wetlands  restoration  or  rehabilitation  program 
actually  enhances  the  ecosystem  resources.  (0022-6  [Butch,  Kerry  Margaret]  [King,  Charlotte]

Response:  There  are  a  number  of  measures  that  could  be  taken  by  PS  EG  to  minimize 
encroachment  into  wetlands  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  As  noted  in  Section  4.3  of  the 
EIS  alterations  to  these  wetlands  were  considered  noticeable  but  not  destabilizing.  The  USACE 
will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable  impacts.

Comment:  We  believe  that,  before  PSEG  should  be  allowed  to  construct  another  burdensome 
facility  on  Artificial  Island,  or  anywhere  within  the  Delaware  Estuary  before  it  is  even  considered, 
they  must  be  forced  to  minimize  the  adverse  environmental  impact  their  existing  facilities 
already  have.  Including  their  fish  kills,  their  harmful  imprint  on  our  wetlands,  the  water  quality 
impacts  they  have  on  the  Delaware  Estuary  waters,  and  more.  (0004-3-12  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  are 
described  in  Chapter  7  of  the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this 
comment. 

Comment:  Also,  we  cannot  conclude,  from  the  information  provided  in  the  DEIS,  whether  the 
proposed  mitigation  for  this  project  will  adequately  compensate  for  the  impacts  described.  The 
DEIS  provides  a  brief  list  of  potential  candidate  sites.  Without  an  opportunity  to  review  a 
comprehensive  mitigation  plan  for  the  project,  we  cannot  determine  that  the  proposed  mitigation 
will  be  sufficient  to  compensate  for  the  project's  impacts.  Therefore,  EPA  recommends  that  the 
Final  EIS  provide  additional  discussion  of  options  for  more  fully  avoiding  and  minimizing  wetland 
impacts,  and  mitigation  plans  for  impacts  that  could  not  be  avoided.  (0017-2  [Mitchell,  Judy-Ann]) 

Comment:  There  is  limited  discussion  and  analysis  of  avoidance/  minimization  measures. 
Avoidance/  minimization  measures  should  be  considered  early  and  as  an  integral  and  critical 
component  of  the  alternatives  development  and  decision-making  processes.  Avoidance/ 
minimization  should  be  explicit  and  carried  out  in  a  way  that  compensatory  mitigation  is  only 
used  as  a  last  resort.  Furthermore,  this  analysis  should  also  be  the  subject  of  public  review  and 
comment.  The  discussion  of  avoidance/  minimization  within  the  DEIS  uses  vague  qualifying 
language  such  as  "most  likely"  (p.  3-22),  "could  include"  (p.4  -41),  and  "could  continue  to  be 
devised"  (p.4-41).  Since  avoidance/  minimization  is  not  explicitly  discussed,  the  analysis  of 
compensatory  actions  is  inadequate  without  knowing  what  actions  are  actually  being 
implemented  to  avoid  or  minimize  impacts.  (0020-2-8  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Specific  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  will  be  further 
defined  with  the  refinement  of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has 
been  selected.  These  refinements  could  continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the  design  phase 
as  detailed  site  layouts  are  developed.  Therefore,  detailed  plans  for  avoidance,  minimization  of 
impacts  and  mitigation  are  not  possible  at  this  stage  of  the  project.  Specific  measures  to  avoid, 
minimize,  or  mitigate  impacts  would  be  addressed  in  the  EIS  for  a  COL,  if  PSEG  applies  to  NRC 
for  a  COL  to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  US  ACE  will 
include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable  impacts.  That 
process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a  statement  of 
findings  addressing  public  interest.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section  404(b)(1) 
guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  proposed  project  results  in  unacceptable  permanent  and  temporary  impacts  to 
wetlands.  Although  the  United  States  is  making  important  progress  in  the  conservation  of 
wetland  resources,  FWS  continues  to  report  that  wetland  losses  are  greater  than  wetland  gains 
[See  Dahl,  T.E.  201 1 .  Status  and  trends  of  wetlands  in  the  conterminous  United  States  2004  to 
2009.  U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior;  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  Washington,  D.C.  108  pp.]. 
Wetlands  continue  to  face  pressures  from  development,  from  the  effects  of  sea  level  rise,  and

from  the  cumulative  effect  of  other  environmental  pollutants  and  stressors.  (0020-2-3  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland  impacts  and  potential  mitigation  activities  in 
Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  There  are  a  number  of  measures  that  could  be  taken  by  PS  EG  to 
minimize  encroachment  into  wetlands  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  Potential  offsite  wetland 
impacts  will  already  be  mitigated  by  using  an  elevated  causeway  design,  with  impacts  limited  to 
pier  placement  and  shading  of  vegetation.  Additional  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential 
impacts  to  wetlands  could  be  formulated  with  the  refinement  of  the  PS  EG  Site  Utilization  Plan 
and  following  the  selection  of  a  reactor  technology.  These  refinements  could  continue  to  be 
devised  throughout  the  design  phase  as  detailed  site  layouts  are  developed.  Several  candidate 
mitigation  areas  that  have  the  potential  to  meet  some  or  all  of  the  PS  EG  wetland  mitigation 
needs  were  identified  during  the  ESP  application  process.  These  candidate  mitigation  areas 
include  portions  of  the  existing  PS  EG  Site,  Mannington  Meadow,  Mason's  Point,  and  additional 
areas  of  the  PSEG  Alloway  Creek  Watershed  Wetland  Restoration  (ACW).  The  NRC  staff 
discusses  potential  cumulative  impacts  on  ecological  resources,  including  wetlands,  in  Section 
7.3  of  the  EIS. 

The  USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable 
impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a 
statement  of  findings  addressing  public  interest.  It  will  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section 
404(b)(1)  guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  "NRC-authorized  activities  would  be  significant  contributors  to  the  noticeable 
impact.  .  ."  from  the  loss  of  important  wetland  resources  (p  4-43).  However,  the  review  team 
asserts  that  the  "habitat  loss  would  not  destabilize  wetland  resources  in  the  vicinity"  (p  4-43). 
This  assessment  is  contradictory  since  the  NRC  states  the  impact  will  be  "noticeable"  but  not 
"destabilizing."  (0020-2-6  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetlands  lost  in  relation  to  wetlands  that  will  remain  in  the 
vicinity  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS  (page  4-28).  Based  on  the  acreage  that  would  be  lost  (131  ac) 
as  the  result  of  building  activities,  alteration  would  be  noticeable.  However,  this  represents  less 
than  1  percent  of  the  25,534  ac  of  wetlands  available  in  the  vicinity.  The  conclusion  that  the 
loss  will  not  be  destabilizing  is  based  on  the  fact  that  only  a  very  small  percentage  of  area 
wetlands  will  be  lost.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  determination  of  whether  there  are  unavoidable  impacts  should  not  be 
arbitrary.  Avoidance  is  always  the  best  alternative,  and  restored  wetlands  cannot  replace 
natural  wetland  functions.  Avoidance  and  minimization  bas  received  less  attention,  and  this 
lack  of  priority  on  these  initial  steps  has  resulted  in  the  ineffective  wetland  conservation  and  the 
preservation  of  aquatic  ecosystem  functions  by  allowing  too  often,  irreparable  harm  and 
permanent  destruction  of  wetlands.  It  is  imperative  that  these  avoidance/  minimization 
measures  are  not  only  considered  but  also  implemented  during  decision-making.  Instead  the 
DEIS  states:  "[additional  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  .  .  .  could  be 
formulated  following  the  selection  of  a  reactor  technology  and  could  continue  to  be  devised 
throughout  the  design  phase  as  detailed  site  layouts  were  developed"  (p.4-41 ).  A  voidance/ 
minimization  should  be  done  during  this  phase  of  the  proposal  and  should  not  be  put  off  until  the

project  site  has  been  decided  on  and  the  project  is  moving  forward.  (0020-2-9  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Response:  Specific  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  will  be  further 
defined  with  the  refinement  of  the  PS  EG  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has 
been  selected.  These  refinements  could  continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the  design  phase 
as  detailed  site  layouts  are  developed.  Therefore,  detailed  plans  for  avoidance,  minimization  of 
impacts  and  mitigation  are  not  possible  at  this  stage  of  the  project.  Specific  measures  to  avoid, 
minimize,  or  mitigate  impacts  would  be  addressed  in  the  EIS  for  a  COL,  if  PS  EG  applies  to  NRC 
for  a  COL  to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site. 

The  US  ACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable 
impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a 
statement  of  findings  addressing  public  interest.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section 
404(b)(1)  guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  In  order  to  accomplish  the  goal  of  "no  net  loss"  of  wetlands,  compensatory 
mitigation  should  only  be  used  to  offset  unavoidable  impacts  after  avoidance  and  minimization 
measures  have  been  evaluated.  There  is  limited  discussion  of  how  PSEG  is  avoiding  and 
minimizing  impacts  to  wetlands.  For  example,  there  is  a  simply  blanket  assertion  that  elevation 
of  a  roadway/causeway  will  eliminate  the  need  for  wetlands  and  water  fill  but  no  discussion 
beyond  that  (p.  3-21).  There  is  no  detailed  discussion  with  regards  to  the  large  footprint  of  the 
proposed  plant  and  associated  infrastructure.  (0020-2-10  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland  impacts  and  potential  mitigation  activities  in 
Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  This  includes  a  discussion  of  potential  impacts  on  wetlands  resulting 
from  building  the  plant  and  associated  infrastructure  on  the  site.  Potential  impacts  on  wetlands 
resulting  from  construction  of  the  proposed  elevated  off -site  causeway  is  also  discussed  in 
Section  4.3.  Specific  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  will  be  further 
defined  with  the  refinement  of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has 
been  selected.  These  refinements  could  continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the  design  phase

Comment:  Page  No.  4-43;  Section  No.  4. 3. 2. 3;  Line  No.  31-32;  The  numbers  provided  for 
permanent  and  temporary  loss  of  wetlands  are  not  consistent  with  the  information  provided  in 
Lines  36-38  of  DEIS  on  page  4-39.  (0015-2-19  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Throughout  [Sections  2.0  and  4.0],  the  NRC  describes  the  acreages  of  the  various 
habitats  that  would  be  affected  by  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  generating 
station  at  the  PSEG  site.  However,  the  numbers  appear  inconsistent  and  seem  to  vary  from 
section  to  section  even  when  describing  the  same  impact  to  the  same  habitat.  In  addition,  the 
impacts  also  appear  different  from  those  described  in  the  Public  Notice  (CENAP-OP-R-2009- 
0157)  issued  by  the  USACE  for  this  project.  The  final  EIS  should  clearly  and  concisely  identify 
all  of  the  temporary  and  permanent  impacts  to  all  habitat  types  and  clearly  define  the  habitat 
types  (i.e.,  estuarine  wetlands,  freshwater  tidal  wetlands,  freshwater  non-tidal,  etc.).  (0018-1-2 
[Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  The  acreage  numbers  cited  in  various  sections  of  the  draft  EIS  may  appear 
inconsistent  because  of  the  numerous  classifications  discussed  for  various  habitat  types.  For 
example,  in  addition  to  the  generic  "wetland, "  the  draft  EIS  discusses  several  types  of  wetland 
habitats  (e.g.,  saline  marsh,  Phragmites-dominated  coastal  wetlands,  deciduous  scrub/shrub 
wetlands,  herbaceous  wetlands,  and  Phragmites-dominated  interior  wetlands);  hence,  the 
"wetland"  acreages  discussed  vary  among  draft  EIS  sections  according  to  the  specific  wetland 
types  being  discussed.  Other  commenters  have  noted  some  specific  inconsistencies  in 
acreages  (e.g.,  on  draft  EIS  4-7,  Line  2),  and  the  text  in  the  EIS  was  revised  to  address  those 
inconsistencies.  However,  none  of  these  revisions  affects  the  conclusions  regarding  the  levels 
of  impact  during  construction  for  either  the  land-use  or  terrestrial  ecology  resource  categories, 
both  of  which  remain  MODE R A  TE  as  discussed  in  Section  4.11. 

Regarding  the  comment  that  "the  impacts  also  appear  different  from  those  described  in  the 
Public  Notice  (CENAP-OP-R-2009-01 57)  issued  by  the  USACE  for  this  project, "  the  impact 
conclusions  described  in  the  draft  EIS  are  based  on  information  provided  by  the  applicant  to  the 
NRC  in  the  ESP  application  and  in  response  to  the  NRC  staff's  reguests  for  additional 
information.  Because  the  USACE  and  the  NRC  have  different  permitting  responsibilities  with 
regard  to  the  proposed  action,  it  is  possible  that  the  applicant  may  have  submitted  different 
acreage  information  in  the  Department  of  the  Army  permit  application  than  in  the  NRC  ESP 
application  due  to  the  different  requirements  for  those  two  separate  permits.  In  addition,  the 
USACE  utilizes  the  Coward  in  System  for  land -use  classification  of  wetlands  and  waters,  the 
overall  acreages  of  impacts  described  according  to  NJDEP  LULC  classification  system  would 
be  similar,  but  may  not  be  identical,  to  the  acreage  calculations  for  the  USACE  values.  It  is  also 
important  to  note  that  the  habitat  condition  and  extent  of  wetlands  may  vary  with  time,  especially 
in  modified  or  disturbed  locations  (e.g.,  CDEs)  where  dredge  materials  are  being  deposited.  The 
USACE  has  prepared  and  approved jurisdictional  determination  for  the  project  site  (USACE 
2014- TN3282).  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Although  the  NRC  asserts  that  the  wetlands  impacts  "are  regulated  under  the 
authority  and  jurisdiction  of  the  USACE  and  NJDEP"  (p  4-41 ),  the  NRC  should  also 
independently  evaluate  the  impact  of  wetland  losses  associated  with  this  project  as  part  of  their 
decision-making.  The  Delaware  River  watershed  is  in  need  of  wetlands  restoration,  and  this 
project  will  surely  not  accomplish  an  improvement  in  wetland  ecosystem  function.  It  is  critical

that  decision-making  is  done  such  that  proposed  projects  help  improve  the  ecological  state  of 
the  estuary  instead  of  justifying  further  damage  by  asserting  the  ecosystem  is  already  degraded. 
(0020-2-5  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  fully  evaluates  potential  Impacts  to  wetlands  as  an  integral  part  of 
the  EIS  process.  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland  impacts  and  potential  mitigation  activities  in 
Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  In  this  section  it  is  noted  that  any  wetlands  are  considered  to  be 
important  habitat  and  alteration  of  wetlands  resulting  from  this  project  will  be  noticeable.  It  is 
further  stated  on  page  4-4  7  of  the  draft  EIS  that  wetlands  are  considered  to  be  an  important 
terrestrial  habitat  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  provide  habitat  for  wildlife  that  frequent  the  area.  There 
are  a  number  of  measures  that  could  be  taken  by  PSEG  to  minimize  encroachment  into 
wetlands  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.  Potential  offsite  wetland  impacts  will  already  be 
mitigated  by  using  an  elevated  causeway  design,  with  impacts  limited  to  pier  placement  and 
shading  of  vegetation.  Additional  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  wetlands 
could  be  formulated  with  the  refinement  of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  following  the 
selection  of  a  reactor  technology.  These  refinements  could  continue  to  be  devised  throughout 
the  design  phase  as  detailed  site  layouts  are  developed. 

The  USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable 
impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a 
statement  of  findings  addressing  public  interest.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section 
404(b)(1)  guidelines. 

Several  candidate  mitigation  areas  that  have  the  potential  to  meet  some  or  all  of  the  PSEG 
wetland  mitigation  needs  were  identified  during  the  ESP  application  process.  These  candidate 
mitigation  areas  include  portions  of  the  existing  PSEG  Site,  Mannington  Meadow,  Mason's 
Point,  and  additional  areas  of  the  PSEG  ACW.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of 
this  comment. 

Comment:  Phragmites  dominated  wetlands  support  numerous  native  organisms,  provide 
important  ecosystems  services,  and  support  biodiversity  and  habitat  functions  that  arc  linked  to 
distinctive  characteristics  of  the  plant  [See  Kiviat  2013,  Ecosystem  services  of  Phragmites  in 
North  America  with  emphasis  on  habitat  functions.  AoB  Plants,  5,  plt008].  For  example,  a  new 
cryptic  species  of  leopard  frog  (Rana  kauffeldi)  with  limited  and  restricted  range  has  just  been 
identified  in  the  Delaware  watershed  and  persists  in  Phragmites  dominated  wetlands  [See 
Feinberg,  J.A.,  Newman,  C.E.,  Watkins-Colwell,  G.J.,  Schlesinger,  M.D.,  Zarate,  B.,  Curry,  B.R., 
&  Burger,  J.  (2014).  Cryptic  Diversity  in  Metropolis:  Confirmation  of  a  New  Leopard  Frog 
Species  (Anura:  Ranidae)  from  New  York  City  and  Surrounding  Atlantic  Coast  Regions.  PloS 
one,  9(10),  el08213.].  This  recent  discovery  of  R.  kauffeldi  illustrates  that  we  must  protect 
sensitive  species  where  they  occur  not  just  pristine  environments.  (0020-2-14  [van  Rossum, 

Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  sensitive  species  need  protection 
wherever  they  occur,  not  just  in  pristine  environments.  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wildlife  that 
may  frequent  the  site  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS.  It  is  acknowledged  in  this  section  that  certain 
wildlife  species  will  utilize  Phragmites-dominated  wetlands  (e.g.,  northern  harrier,  black-crowned 
night- heron,  red-winged  blackbird,  and  marsh  wren).  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland  impacts

and  potential  mitigation  activities  in  Section  4. 3  of  the  EIS.  Section  4. 3  includes  a  discussion  of 
potential  impacts  on  wildlife  populations  due  to  habitat  loss,  Including  loss  of  wetlands.  It  is 
acknowledged  in  Section  4.3  that  certain  wildlife  species  will  be  impacted  by  the  loss  of 
Phragmites-dominated  wetlands  (e.g.,  northern  harrier).  Although  the  leopard  frog  has  not  been 
recorded  on  the  PSEG  Site,  it  has  the  potential  to  be  affected  by  the  construction  and  operation 
of  new  nuclear  facility.  As  stated  in  Section  4.3,  wetlands  resources  on  the  PSEG  Site  are 
considered  to  be  important  habitat  and  alteration  of  wetlands  as  the  result  of  this  project  will  be 
noticeable,  but  would  not  destabilize  important  attributes  of  the  resource  within  the  vicinity  or 
region. 

The  USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable 
impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a 
statement  of  findings  addressing  public  interest.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section 
404(b)(1)  guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  (EEP)  that  was  so  often  referenced  in  the  NRC 
public  hearing  on  October  1 ,  2014,  and  which  is  most  certainly  to  serve  as  the  model  for  any 
wetlands  mitigation  options  proposed  by  PSEG,  is  based  on  the  false  premise  that  Phragmites 
australis  is  of  lesser  ecological  value  than  Spartina  alterniflora.  Converting  a  Phragmites 
dominated  wetlands  to  Spartina  wetlands  will  not  enhance  the  ecological  value  of  the  proposed 
mitigation  sites.  The  EEP  model  is  not  substantiated  by  scientific  research,  is  not  a  net  positive 
contribution  to  the  Delaware  Estuary  wetland  system,  and  is  not  an  independently  sustainable 
mitigation  option.  (0020-2-16  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  "potential"  mitigation  measures  (Section  4. 3. 2. 2)  are  based  on  the  false 
premise  that  converting  Phragmites  dominated  wetlands  to  Spartina  alterniflora  dominated 
wetlands  will  enhance  the  ecological  value  of  the  proposed  mitigation  site  [See  Kiviat  2013, 
Ecosystem  services  of  Phragmites  in  North  America  with  emphasis  on  habitat  functions.  AoB 
Plants,  5,  plt008;  and  See  also  Kettenring  et  al.  2012,  Moving  from  a  regional  to  a  continental 
perspective  of  Phragmites  australis  invasion  in  North  America.  AoB  plants,  2012,  pls040] .  The 
proposed  mitigation  measures  would  be  to  transform  existing  tidal  marshes  through  the  removal 
and  conversion  of  the  dominant  vegetation.  This  type  of  mitigation  will  not  restore  more 
valuable  (enhancement)  nor  return  natural  (restoration)  wetland  functions-two  of  the 
appropriate  forms  of  compensatory  mitigation  [See  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency. 
Wetlands  Compensatory  Mitigation  Factsheet.  EPA-843-F-08-002.].  (0020-2-17  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland  impacts  and  potential  mitigation  activities  in 
Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  Section  4.3  includes  a  discussion  of  potential  impacts  on  wildlife 
populations  due  to  habitat  loss,  including  loss  of  wetlands.  It  is  acknowledged  in  this  section 
that  certain  wildlife  species  will  be  impacted  by  the  loss  of  Phragmites-dominated  wetlands 
(e.g.,  northern  harrier).  The  NRC  staff  has  reviewed  the  information  provided  by  the 
commenters.  However,  current  literature  indicates  that  monocultures  of  Phragmites-dominated 
wetlands  are  generally  not  considered  to  be  of  high  quality  and  offer  less  value  to  terrestrial  and 
aquatic  resources  than  other  wetland  types.  The  USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid, 
minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable  impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a 
separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a  statement  of  findings  addressing  public

interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section 
404(b)(1)  guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  review  team  concluded  that"...  habitat  loss  would  not  destabilize  wetland 
resources  in  the  vicinity"  (p  4-43).  However,  this  conclusion,  which  falsely  assumes  proper 
mitigation  for  unavoidable  and  permanent  impacts,  is  unsubstantiated  and  inaccurate  without  a 
full  analysis  of  the  mitigation  plans.  (0020-3-2  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  commenter  indicates  that  the  NRC  staff's  conclusion  is  based  on  proposed 
mitigation.  The  NRC  staff  concluded  that  the  habitat  loss  due  to  this  project  would  be 
noticeable,  but  would  not  destabilize  overall  wetland  resources  in  the  area  because  the  loss 
represents  less  than  1  percent  of  the  wetlands  in  the  vicinity  and  does  not  take  into  account 
mitigation  (Section  4.3  of  the  EIS).  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this 
comment. 

Comment:  According  to  the  DEIS,  wetland  mitigation  methods  " ...  might  include  the  control  of 
Phragmites,  restoration  of  the  hydrologic  state  (Levee  removal,  channel  design,  and 
reestablishing  a  connection  of  upland  areas  to  tidal  influences),  and  wetland  enhancement  that 
include  restoration  of  desirable  and  native  vegetation."  (p  4-42).  Without  explicit  descriptions  of 
the  methods  that  PSEG  intends  to  utilize  to  accomplish  mitigation,  we  can  only  assume  that 
PSEG  is  proposing  the  same  mitigation  measures  for  this  project  that  it  used  for  previous 
projects.  PSEG  has  applied  tens  of  thousands  of  pounds  of  herbicides,  as  well  as  engaging  in 
discing,  mowing,  and  burning,  all  of  which  adversely  impact  the  habitat  and  introduce  dangerous 
chemicals  into  our  environment.  For  example,  one-time  applications  of  herbicide  are  never 
effective,  and  therefore,  herbicides  must  be  used  in  a  multi-year  application,  resulting  in  a  long¬ 
term  commitment  and  ongoing  environmental  damage  [see  Kettenring,  K.M.,  &  Adams,  C.R. 

(201 1 ).  Lessons  learned  from  invasive  plant  control  experiments:  a  systematic  review  and 
meta-analysis.  Journal  of  Applied  Ecology,  48(4),  970-979].  Due  to  the  potential  for 
environmental  impact  from  specific  mitigation  measures,  a  full  mitigation  plan  should  be 
established  and  the  environmental  impact  of  such  measures  should  be  fully  evaluated  by  the 
NRC  as  part  of  their  analysis  of  the  environmental  impact  of  this  project.  (0020-3-3  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Response:  Any  proposed  mitigation  methods  will  be  reviewed  and  go  through  the  Department 
of  the  Army  permit  application  approval  process.  The  USACE  permit  review  process  will  include 
further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable  impacts.  That  process 
will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a  statement  of  findings 
addressing  public  interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It  will  also  include  an  analysis  of  the 
Section  404(b)(1)  guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  NRC  should  also  consider  whether  PSEG  will,  in  fact,  fully  and  adequately 
implement  all  mitigation  measures.  PSEG  is  proposing  the  same  "potential"  mitigation 
measures  for  this  project  that  it  made,  and  subsequently  failed  to  implement,  in  previous 
projects.  (0020-3-4  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Any  proposed  mitigation  methods  will  be  reviewed  and  go  through  an  approval 
process.  The  USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the

unavoidable  impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will 
consist  of  a  statement  of  findings  addressing  public  interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It 
would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section  404(b)(1)  guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  EEP  model  for  compensatory  mitigation  used  by  PSEG  in  the  past  is  not 
sustainable  because  the  change  in  vegetation  that  is  proposed  can  only  persist  through 
continual  and  often  invasive  interventions  the  Delaware  Bay  area  is  borne  to  large  swaths  of 
Phragmites  and  so  there  is  a  perpetual  source  for  the  species  which  will  repopulate  any  area  of 
appropriate  habitat  condition  that  is  not  concertedly  managed  to  prevent  this.  For  example, 
PSEG  eliminated  1 ,200  acres  in  the  Mill  Creek  area  from  the  EEP  program  because  of  an 
inability  to  convert  Phragmites  to  Spartina  after  5  years  of  herbicide  application.  The  Alloway 
Creek  EEP  site  was  also  reduced  in  size  (p  4-43).  The  fact  that  these  wetlands  will  not  be 
sustainable  in  the  absence  of  an  ongoing  obligation  by  PSEG  to  continue  these  damaging 
activities  is  indefensible  for  achieving  the  goal  of  wetlands  protection  or  mitigation.  (0020-3-5 
[van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  acknowledges  that  any  non- native  invasive  plant  control  program 
reguires  persistence  to  achieve  success.  The  USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid, 
minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable  impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a 
separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a  statement  of  findings  addressing  public 
interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section 
404(b)(1)  guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Scientific  research  has  documented  that  land-use  patterns  on  adjacent  sites 
influence  the  success  of  restoration  plans,  and  for  Phragmites  management  to  be  successful, 
plans  should  be  developed  at  the  watershed-scale  (vs.  a  site  level  scale)  so  to  address  the 
source  of  invasion  and  should  focus  on  restoring  native  plant  communities  rather  than  simply 
eradicating  Phragmites  stands  [See  Hazelton  et  al.  2014,  Phragmites  australis  management  in 
the  United  States:  40  years  of  methods  and  outcomes.  AoB  plants,  6,  pluOOl ].  The  methods 
used  by  PSEG  in  the  past  do  little  to  reduce  the  dominance  of  Phragmites  in  the  long  term.  For 
example,  mowing  can  actually  stimulate  shoot  production  resulting  in  an  increased  density  of 
Phragmites  shoots  [See  Derr,  J.F.  (2008).  Common  reed  (Phragmites  australis)  response  to 
mowing  and  herbicide  application.  Invasive  Plant  Science  and  Management,  1  (I),  12-16.;  and 
See  also  Warren  et  al.  (2001).  Rates,  patterns,  and  impacts  of  Phragmites  australis  expansion 
and  effects  of  experimental  Phragmites  control  on  vegetation,  macroinvertebrates,  and  fish 
within  tidelands  of  the  lower  Connecticut  River.  Estuaries,  24(1),  90-107],  The  fact  that  PSEG 
has  made  identical  mitigation  plans  in  past  projects,  and  has  been  unsuccessful  in  enhancing 
the  wetland  resources  of  the  watershed,  weighs  heavily  against  PSEG's  credibility. 

Furthermore,  it  demonstrates  the  inadequacy  of  the  NRC's  review  to  specifically  and 
substantively  respond  to  this  criticism  in  this  DEIS.  (0020-3-6  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  acknowledges  that  any  non -native  invasive  plant  control  program 
reguires  persistence  to  achieve  success,  and  that  watershed  or  regional  approaches  are  always 
desirable  in  order  to  achieve  overall  success.  Even  on  a  watershed  basis  there  are  limitations 
on  the  ability  to  control  activities  on  other  properties.  The  USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to 
avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable  impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with

a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a  statement  of  findings  addressing  public 
interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section 
404(b)(1)  guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  There  is  insufficient  information  about  mitigation  methods  that  involve  "control  of 
Phragmites."  The  review  of  "potential"  mitigation  methods  is  necessary  because  methods  using 
herbicides  and  more  specifically,  glyphosate,  have  detrimental  impacts  to  the  environment.  The 
"potential"  mitigation  methods  listed  in  the  DEIS  focus  on  Phragmites  control  without  specifying 
how  the  vegetation  removal  will  occur.  The  EEP  has  been  largely  dependent  upon  the  use  of 
the  broad  spectrum  herbicide  glyphosate  that  is  dangerous  to  the  environment  and  to  people. 
(0020-3-7  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  [T]he  ongoing  application  of  glyphosate  into  our  sensitive  ecological  systems  is  a 
high  priority  concern  that  should  not  be  perpetuated  by  the  NRC  in  their  consideration,  review 
and  approvals  of  the  [PSEG]  proposal.  The  ecosystem  services  provided  by  Phragmites  and 
the  wetland  mitigation  sites  should  be  weighed  against  the  environmental  damages  caused  by 
the  removal  of  Phragmites  through  the  use  of  herbicides  and  glyphosate.  (0020-3-8  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Comment:  The  NRC  should  evaluate  the  environmental  impact  of  the  methods  that  PSEG  will 
use  to  compensate  for  permanent  wetland  losses  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  project.  Scientific 
research  has  shown  that  the  herbicide  glyphosate  is  dangerous  to  the  environment  and  to 
people,  and  therefore,  should  not  be  used  for  compensatory  mitigation  because  it  will  cause 
greater  harm.  (0020-3-9  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  review  of  "potential"  mitigation  methods  is  necessary  because  methods  using 
herbicides  and  more  specifically,  Glyphosate,  have  detrimental  impacts  to  the  environment. 
PSEG's  previous  mitigation  plans  have  been  largely  dependent  upon  the  use  of  the  broad 
spectrum  herbicide  glyphosate  that  is  dangerous  to  the  environment  and  to  people.  The 
ecosystem  services  provided  by  the  wetland  mitigation  sites  should  be  weighed  against  the 
environmental  damages  caused  by  the  use  of  herbicides  and  glyphosate.  (0022-7  [Butch,  Kerry

Response:  Specific  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  will  be  further 
defined  with  the  refinement  of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has 
been  selected.  Ehese  refinements  could  continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the  design  phase 
as  detailed  site  layouts  are  developed.  Eh  ere  fore,  detailed  plans  for  avoidance,  minimization  of 
impacts  and  mitigation  are  not  possible  at  this  stage  of  the  project.  Specific  measures  to  avoid,

minimize,  or  mitigate  impacts  would  be  addressed  in  the  EIS  for  a  COL,  if  PSEG  applies  to  NRC 
for  a  COL  to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site.  The  US  ACE  will  include 
further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable  impacts  which  would 
include  compliance  with  Department  of  the  Army  regulations  related  to  mitigation  (33  CFR  320- 
332).  That  process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a 
statement  of  findings  addressing  public  interest.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section 
404(b)(1)  guidelines.  PSEG  would  also  be  required  to  meet  applicable  NJDEP  rules  and 
regulations  concerning  mitigation.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these 
comments. 

Comment:  Wetlands  also  provide  many  other  important  ecological  functions  and  services  to 
society  including  fish  and  wildlife  habitat,  food  chain  support,  surface  water  retention  or 
detention,  groundwater  recharge,  and  nutrient  transformation,  sediment  retention  and 
atmospheric  equilibrium.  The  primary  production  in  wetlands  forms  the  base  of  the  food  web 
that  supports  insects  and  forage  fish  that  are  then  prey  species  for  larger  fish  such  as  bluefish, 
summer  flounder  and  other  species  that  have  been  documented  in  the  marsh  creeks 
surrounding  the  project  site.  The  water  quality  services  provided  by  these  wetlands  retain 
nutrients,  sediments  and  contaminants  and  improve  water  quality.  Wetlands  may  also  help  to 
moderate  global  climate  change  through  carbon  storage  within  the  plant  communities  and  soil. 
The  loss  of  wetlands  as  a  result  of  this  project  can  adversely  affect  resources  of  concern  to 
NMFS  species  though  the  reduction  in  prey  species  and  primary  production,  as  well  as  water 
quality  degradation  from  the  reduction  in  sediment  retention  and  pollution  filtration.  (0018-1-14 
[Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  the  value  of  wetlands  to  terrestrial  wildlife  that  may 
frequent  the  site  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS.  It  is  acknowledged  in  this  section  that  certain  wildlife 
species  will  utilize  the  mainly  Phragmites-dominated  wetlands  (e.g.,  northern  harrier,  black  - 
crowned  night- heron,  red -winged  blackbird,  and  marsh  wren).  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland 
impacts  and  potential  mitigation  activities  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  Section  4.3  includes  a 
discussion  of  potential  impacts  on  wildlife  populations  due  to  habitat  loss,  including  loss  of 
wetlands.  It  is  acknowledged  in  this  section  that  certain  wildlife  species  will  be  impacted  by  the 
loss  of  Phragmites-dominated  wetlands  (e.g.,  northern  harrier).  As  stated  in  Section  4.3, 
impacts  to  wetlands  as  the  result  of  this  project  will  be  noticeable,  but  will  not  destabilize 
important  attributes  of  these  resources.  The  USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid, 
minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable  impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a 
separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a  statement  of  findings  addressing  public 
interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section 
404(b)(1)  guidelines.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  CWA  Guidelines  require  avoidance,  then  minimization  of  impacts  to  the  aquatic 
environment.  Compensatory  mitigation  is  also  required  for  all  unavoidable  impacts.  Due  to  the 
nature  of  the  Early  Site  Permit  process,  on-site  avoidance  and  minimization  has  not  been 
demonstrated.  Once  a  site  design  is  selected,  PSEG  should  demonstrate  that  the  design 
selected  avoids  and  minimizes  adverse  impacts  to  the  aquatic  environment,  including 
minimizing  wetlands  fill.  A  compensatory  mitigation  plan  should  be  developed  in  accordance 
with  the  2008  Federal  Mitigation  Regulations  to  offset  any  unavoidable  adverse  effects.  We 
understand  that  some  of  the  potential  mitigation  sites  may  be  State-owned  Wildlife  Management

Areas.  Conducting  compensatory  mitigation  on  State-owned  land  may  not  be  permitted  by  the 
New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection.  In  addition,  since  these  areas  are 
primarily  wetlands  already,  sufficient  information  must  be  presented  to  demonstrate  that  the 
ecological  enhancements  proposed  on  the  mitigation  site  will  offset  the  functions  and  values  at 
the  project  site.  (0018-1-15  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  Specific  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  will  be  further 
defined  with  the  refinement  of  the  PS  EG  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has 
been  selected.  These  refinements  could  continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the  design  phase 
as  detailed  site  layouts  are  developed.  Therefore,  detailed  plans  for  avoidance,  minimization  of 
impacts  and  mitigation  are  not  possible  at  this  stage  of  the  project.  Specific  measures  to  avoid, 
minimize,  or  mitigate  impacts  would  be  addressed  in  the  EIS  for  a  COL,  if  PS  EG  applies  to  NRC 
for  a  COL  to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site.  The  US  ACE  will  include 
further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable  impacts.  That  process 
will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a  statement  of  findings 
addressing  public  interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It  would  also  include  an  analysis  of 
the  Section  404(b)(1)  guidelines.  Such  steps  are  aimed  at  improving  wetland  habitat  and 
function.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  2.4. 1 . 1 ,  page  2-59-Amphibians:  reports  the  first  known  siting  of  green  tree 
frogs  (Hyla  cinerea)  in  New  Jersey  on  the  PSEG  site;  the  significance  of  this  discovery  --  and 
potential  project  impacts  to  this  frog  population-should  be  evaluated  by  the  Division  of  Fish  and 
Wildlife.  [Also  sec  Section  4.3.1 .2,  page  4-38-Other  Important  Terrestrial  Species  and  Section 
5. 3. 1.2,  page  5-28-Other  Important  Species]  (0021-5-4  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Specific  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  the  green  tree  frog  will 
be  further  defined  with  the  refinement  of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor 
technology  has  been  selected.  Based  on  the  current  overlay  of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan, 
habitats  in  which  green  tree  frogs  were  observed  would  be  altered  or  eliminated  as  the  result  of 
preconstruction  and  construction  activities.  However,  refinements  could  continue  to  be  devised 
throughout  the  design  phase  as  detailed  site  layouts  are  developed.  Therefore,  detailed  plans 
for  avoidance,  minimization  of  impacts,  and  mitigation  of  potential  impacts  to  the  green  tree  frog 
are  not  possible  at  this  stage  of  the  project.  Specific  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  or  mitigate 
impacts  would  be  addressed  in  the  EIS  for  a  COL,  if  PSEG  applies  to  NRC  for  a  COL  to  build 
and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site.  If  application  is  made  for  a  COL,  there  will 
be  additional  opportunities  for  evaluation  of  potential  impacts  to  the  green  tree  frog  at  that  time. 
The  USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable 
impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a 
statement  of  findings  addressing  public  interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It  would  also

Comment:  [The  NJDEP  Endangered  &  Non-game  Species  Program  (ENSP)]  would  want  to 
have  sufficient  mitigation  for  loss  of  marshes,  both  permanent  and  temporary,  and  especially  to 
target  the  most  at-risk  species  -  the  ones  that  require  high  marsh  and  which  have  been  hurt  by 
earlier  PSE&G  projects.  ENSP  would  even  suggest  they  need  to  set  aside  mitigation  funding

Response:  Specific  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  will  be  further 
defined  with  the  refinement  of  the  PS  EG  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has

Comment:  [The  NJDEP  Endangered  &  Non-game  Species  Program  concerns 
include:]  Possible  degradation  of  the  marsh  due  to  changes  in  hydrology,  spread  of  invasive 
plants,  etc.  (0021-3-3  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  evaluates  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  as  an  integral  part  of  the 
EIS  process.  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland  impacts  and  potential  mitigation  activities  in 
Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  In  this  section  it  is  noted  that  any  wetlands  are  considered  to  be 
important  habitat  and  alteration  of  wetlands  resulting  from  this  project  will  be  noticeable.  It  is 
further  stated  in  Section  4. 3. 1.4  in  this  FEIS  that  wetlands  are  considered  to  be  an  important 
terrestrial  habitat  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  provide  habitat  for  wildlife  that  frequent  the  area.  The 
USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the  unavoidable 
impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will  consist  of  a 
statement  of  findings  addressing  public  interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It  would  also 
include  an  analysis  of  the  Section  404(b)(1)  guidelines.  In  addition,  PSEG  will  be  required  to 
meet  NJDEP  rules  and  regulations  pertaining  to  mitigation  activities.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  At  this  latitude  of  the  Bay,  the  most  prominent  species  of  concern  arc  bald  eagles 
and  the  highmarsh  dependent  birds  (harrier  and  black  rail).  The  wetland  mitigation  should 
address  these  species  and  include  creation  and  stabilization  of  tidal  marsh  and  high  marsh. 
(0021-3-6  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  NRC  acknowledges  the  importance  of  bald  eagles,  northern  harriers,  black 
rails  and  other  bird  species  frequenting  wetlands  in  this  area  of  the  Delaware  Bay.  Specific 
measures  taken  to  mitigate  impacts  to  wetlands  will  be  further  defined  with  the  refinement  of  the 
PSE G  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has  been  selected.  These 
refinements  could  continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the  design  phase  as  detailed  site  layouts 
are  developed.  Therefore,  detailed  plans  for  mitigation  are  not  possible  at  this  stage  of  the 
project.  Specific  measures  taken  to  mitigate  impacts  would  be  addressed  in  the  EIS  for  a  COL,

statement  of  findings  addressing  public  interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It  would  also 
include  an  analysis  of  the  Section  404(b)(1)  guidelines.  In  addition,  PSEG  will  be  required  to 
meet  NJDEP  rules  and  regulations  pertaining  to  mitigation  activities.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  DEIS  states  on  page  [5-17],  that  Total  Dissolved  solids  (TDS)  found  in  the 
vapor  and  drift  have  the  potential  to  be  deposited  onto  foliage  or  soil  and  cause  visible  damage 
and  or  chronic  effects.  Discussion  focuses  solely  on  salt  deposition.  Are  there  any  other 
dissolved  solids  that  should  be  discussed  (such  as  chemicals/cleaning  agents/biocides/etc.)? 
(0023-2-17  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  Ehe  discussion  of  impacts  to  foliage  due  to  the  vapor  and  drift  from  the  cooling 
towers  is  based  on  salt  deposition  because  salt  is  the  primary  constituent  that  has  the  potential 
to  cause  damage  to  foliage.  This  is  particularly  true  for  the  water  taken  from  this  portion  of  the 
Delaware  River,  which  has  estuarine  characteristics.  Therefore,  the  analysis  focused  on 
deposition  from  salt  and  not  the  other  dissolved  solids,  substances,  or  chemicals  that  may  be 
found  in  the  vapor  from  the  cooling  towers,  because  these  other  constituents  would  be  present 
in  trace  amounts  that  would  not  be  expected  to  cause  any  discernible  impact  to  the 
environment.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-53;  Section  No.  2.4.1. 1;  Line  No.  42-43;  The  DEIS  states:  "Deciduous 
scrub/shrub  wetlands  are  composed  of  young  saplings  of  tree  species  such  as  red  maple  ..." 
Recommend  changing  to  say  "Deciduous  scrub/shrub  wetlands  may  be  composed  of  young 
saplings  of  tree  species  such  as  red  maple  ...".  Although  these  species  may  be  present  in 
scrub/shrub  wetlands  within  the  region,  these  species  are  not  typical  of  wetlands  on  site.  (0015- 
1-12  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  A  minor  change  has  been  made  in  Section  2. 4. 1.1  of  the  EIS  to  address  this 
comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-59;  Section  No.  2.4.1 .1 ;  Line  No.  20-22;  To  be  consistent  with  ER 
2.4.1 .2.3,  it  should  be  noted  that  neither  the  tiger  salamander  nor  any  other  listed  amphibians 
were  observed  during  the  2009  surveys.  (0015-1-13  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  Fowler's  toad,  a  species  listed  as  "special  concern"  in  New  Jersey,  was 
recorded  during  2009  field  surveys.  The  text  in  Section  2. 4. 1.1  of  the  EIS  has  been  modified  to 
reflect  that  tiger  salamanders  were  not  recorded  during  2009  surveys. 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-59;  Section  No.  2.4. 1.1;  Line  No.  27;  Coyote  is  a  valuable  native 
species,  not  a  nuisance  species.  (0015-1-14  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  acknowledges  that  coyotes  can  be  beneficial  as  a  predator  in  the 
food  chain  in  natural  settings.  However,  they  can  become  a  nuisance  in  urban/suburban 
settings  where  they  lose  their  fear  of  humans,  which  can  result  in  more  confrontations  with 
people  and  their  pets.  Additional  language  has  been  added  to  Section  2. 4. 1.1  of  the  EIS  to 
further  clarify  the  role  of  the  coyote  in  the  environment.

Comment:  Page  No.  2-59;  Section  No.  2.4. 1.1;  Line  No.  32-33;  The  DEIS  states:  "The  PSEG 
Site  has  one  invasive  pest  plant  species,  the  invasive  strain  of  common  reed..."  The  statement 
is  not  accurate.  There  are  other  non-native  invasive  plant  species  onsite,  such  as  Lespedeza 
cuneata.  The  one  that  has  caused  serious  problems,  however,  is  the  common  reed 
(Phragmites  australis).  (0015-1-15  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  text  in  Section  2. 4.1.1  of  the  EIS  has  been  modified  to  reflect  that  the  common 
reed  is  not  the  only  invasive  plant  species  found  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-79;  Section  No.  2. 4. 1.3;  Line  No.  21-22;  Suggest  changing  " ...  any

navigable  waters  of  the  United  ..."  (0015-1-16  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  text  in  Section  2.4. 1.3  of  the  EIS  has  been  revised  to  insert  the  word 
" navigable "  at  the  location  indicated  in  the  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-33;  Section  No.  4.3.1 .2;  Line  No.  17-18;  Change  "A  total  of  80.3  ac  of 
this  habitat  would  be  temporarily  eliminated."  to  "A  total  of  1 00  ac  of  this  habitat  would  be 
temporarily  eliminated."  (See  ER  Subsection  4.3.1 .3.1 .3).  (0015-2-16  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  80.3  ac  of  temporary  disturbance  does  not  include  acreage  in  upland  rights-of- 
way  (ROW)  (undeveloped).  Table  4-1  in  the  EIS  notes  that  temporary  disturbance  of  upland 
ROW  (undeveloped)  equals  19.6  ac.  This  additional  acreage  increases  the  total  acres  to 
99.9  ac  (80.3  ac  +  19.6  ac)  .  The  text  in  Section  4.3. 1.2  of  the  EIS  has  been  revised  to  reflect 
this  change. 

Comment:  Section  4.3.1 .1 ,  page  4-26-Forestland,  para.  #1 :  notes  that  80.3  acres  of  forests  will 
be  "temporarily  disturbed"  on  the  PSEG  site,  and  an  additional  1  acre  "temporarily  disturbed" 
associated  with  construction  of  the  proposed  causeway.  If  these  impacts  to  forests  are 
"temporary"  -how  will  they  be  restored?  (0021-4-18  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  A  mitigation  and  compensation  plan  should  be  developed  and  implemented.  The 
DEIS  states  on  page  4-41  "Following  the  implementation  of  reasonable  measures  to  avoid  or 
minimize  impacts  to  wetlands,  compensation  for  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  could  be 
undertaken  with  the  execution  of  an  approved  wetland  restoration  and/or  rehabilitation 
program."  -  This  tiered  approach  of  avoid,  minimize  and  mitigate  for  impacts  need  not  be  solely 
for  wetland  impacts.  The  same  considerations  and  compensation  should  be  discussed  in  the 
final  EIS  for  upland  habitats  and  the  associated  species  that  utilize  these  habitats  including  the 
bird  species  and  habitats  mentioned  above.  (0023-1-16  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  potential  restoration  measures  for  temporary  impacts  to 
upland  terrestrial  habitats  in  Section  4. 3. 1.4  of  this  EIS.  Mitigation  of  temporary  impacts  could 
include  restoration  with  native  cover  types.  Specific  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential 
impacts  to  terrestrial  habitats  will  be  further  defined  with  the  refinement  of  the  PSEG  Site 
Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has  been  selected.  These  refinements  could 
continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the  design  phase  as  detailed  site  layouts  are  developed. 
Therefore,  detailed  plans  for  avoidance,  minimization  of  impacts,  and  mitigation  are  not  possible

at  this  stage  of  the  project.  Specific  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  or  mitigate  impacts  would  be 
addressed  in  the  EIS  for  a  COL,  if  PSEG  applies  to  NRC  for  a  COL  to  build  and  operate  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these 
comments. 

Comment:  Many  of  the  construction-related  impacts  are  noted  as  "temporary"  in  duration. 
However,  construction  activities  will  occur  over  an  estimated  time  period  of  7  years  (see  Table 
3-2,  page  3-20).  (0021-5-3  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  acknowledges  that  preconstruction  and  construction  activities 
associated  with  a  new  reactor  can  be  lengthy.  However,  these  impacts  are  considered  to  be 
temporary  because  these  areas  will  ultimately  be  restored  through  mitigation  activities.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  DEIS  describes  anticipated  ecological  impacts  to  plants  and  animals  living  in 
the  various  land-use  categories  covered  in  Table  4-1.  Forestland  cover,  particularly  old  field 
communities  represent  important  habitat  for  many  birds  and  insects.  Almost  90  acres  of  this 
habitat  would  be  disturbed,  most  (80.3  acres)  temporarily.  The  DEIS  states  that  there  are  over 
2000  acres  of  this  habitat  nearby,  but  that  does  not  alleviate  concerns  with  regards  to  the  up  to 
eight  years  of  temporary  impacts  and  permanent  loss  proposed.  In  addition  agricultural  lands 
(currently  offsite)  provide  important  habitat  for  migrating  songbirds  and  Monarch  butterflies. 

Over  12  acres  of  agricultural  lands  (Table  4-2)  would  be  permanently  lost.  The  DEIS  notes  that 
the  greatest  challenge  to  species  impacted  by  disturbance  would  be  competition  from  existing 
resident  species  in  adjacent  suitable  habitat.  This  will  place  additional  pressure  on  neighboring 
species  outside  of  the  impact  areas.  (0023-1-13  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  acknowledges  that  there  will  be  both  temporary  and  permanent 
impacts  to  terrestrial  wildlife  habitat.  The  NRC  staff  discusses  these  impacts  in  Section  4. 3. 1  of 
the  EIS.  In  this  section  it  is  acknowledged  that  displacement  of  species  into  surrounding  areas 
would  likely  cause  increased  competition  for  resources  (i.e.,  food,  cover,  and  nesting  sites)  in 
those  areas,  resulting  in  some  negative  overall  impacts  to  species  populations  where  habitat 
carrying  capacity  is  exceeded. 

The  NRC  staff  also  acknowledges  that  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  associated 
with  a  new  reactor  can  be  lengthy.  However,  those  impacts  noted  as  temporary  will  ultimately 
be  restored  through  mitigation  activities.  The  NRC  staff  discusses  potential  restoration 
measures  for  temporary  impacts  to  upland  terrestrial  habitats  in  Section  4.3. 7. 4  of  this  EIS. 
Mitigation  of  temporary  impacts  could  include  restoration  with  native  cover  types.  Specific 
measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  habitats  will  be  further  defined  with 
the  refinement  of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has  been 
selected.  These  refinements  could  continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the  design  phase  as 
detailed  site  layouts  are  developed.  Therefore,  detailed  plans  for  avoidance,  minimization  of 
impacts,  and  mitigation  are  not  possible  at  this  stage  of  the  project.  Specific  measures  to  avoid, 
minimize,  or  mitigate  impacts  would  be  addressed  in  the  EIS  for  a  COL,  if  PSEG  applies  to  NRC 
for  a  COL  to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments.

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  potential  restoration  measures  for  temporary  impacts  to 
upland  terrestrial  habitats  in  Section  4.3. 1.4  of  this  EIS.  Mitigation  of  temporary  impacts  could 
include  restoration  with  native  cover  types.  Specific  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential 
impacts  to  terrestrial  habitats  will  be  further  defined  with  the  refinement  of  the  PS  EG  Site 
Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has  been  selected.  These  refinements  could 
continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the  design  phase  as  detailed  site  layouts  are  developed. 
Therefore,  detailed  plans  for  avoidance,  minimization  of  impacts,  and  mitigation  are  not  possible 
at  this  stage  of  the  project.  Specific  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  or  mitigate  impacts  would  be 
addressed  in  the  EIS  for  a  COL,  if  PS  EG  applies  to  NRC  for  a  COL  to  build  and  operate  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  site.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these 
comments. 

Comment:  Chapter  7  "Cumulative  Impacts"  states  that  "Literature  regarding  bat  collisions  with 
cooling  tower  structures  is  limited."  Yet  goes  on  the  state  that  Erickson  et  al.  suggest  that  bat 
species  may  not  use  echolocation  during  migration,  which  can  result  in  higher  collision  rates 
with  human-made  structures.  The  project  and  other  actions  considered  in  the  Cumulative 
Impact  Analysis  presented  in  Table  7-1  notes  several  additional  nearby  human  made  structures 
where  avian  and  bat  collisions  are  documented  or  are  thought  to  cause  additional  impacts.  Until 
additional  site  specific  information  is  collected,  relying  on  Erickson  et  al.'s  2002  report  is  not 
prudent.  (0023-2-15  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  There  is  additional  discussion  of  potential  impacts  on  avian  and  bat  species  due  to 
collisions  with  human-made  structures  in  Section  4.3. 7  of  the  EIS.  This  includes  results  of  a 
past  study  of  avian  mortalities  associated  with  a  natural  draft  cooling  tower  at  the  existing 
HCGS.  If  PS  EG  applies  for  a  license  to  construct  and  operate  a  reactor  or  reactors  at  the 
PS  EG  Site,  there  would  be  an  opportunity  to  collect  site-specific  data  based  on  the  specific 
design  selected  if  necessary.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Statements  within  the  DEIS  are  generally  dismissive  of  the  potential  wetland 
impacts;  the  rationale  being  that  wetlands  are  abundant  in  the  area.  While  this  is  a  likely  habitat 
to  predominate  an  estuarine  environment,  coastal  wetlands  are  subject  to  development 
pressure  and  sea  level  rise,  and  losses  are  occurring  at  alarming  rates.  The  final  EIS  should 
evaluate  predicted  wetland  losses  from  these  pressures.  (0023-1-19  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  potential  impacts  associated  with  the  loss  of  wetlands  in 
Section  4.3  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion  on  ecological  impacts  of 
preconstruction/construction.  In  this  section  the  importance  of  wetlands  as  habitat  is  noted  and 
the  alteration  of  wetlands  as  a  result  of  the  project  would  be  noticeable.  The  NRC  staff 
discusses  the  potential  cumulative  impacts  associated  with  the  loss  of  wetlands  in  Section  7.3  of 
the  EIS.  The  NRC  staff  discusses  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  and  urban 
development  on  ecological  resources  in  Section  7.3  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the  discussion  on 
cumulative  impacts.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment.

Comment:  The  DEIS  indicates  that  the  northern  parula  and  hooded  warbler,  two  species  of 
concern,  were  recorded  during  the  Breeding  Bird  Survey  by  USGS,  yet  these  species  are  not 
expected  to  be  impacted  because  the  site  contains  very  little  viable  habitat  to  support  these 
species.  However,  these  species  were  found  breeding  nearby,  indicating  that  they  are  also 
foraging  to  feed  their  young  during  this  time.  It  is  likely  they  would  enter  the  site  to  collect  food 
and  thus  be  impacted  by  disturbance  at  the  proposed  site.  (0023-1-15  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  text  in  Section  4.3. 1.2  of  the  EIS  has  been  modified  to  reflect  that  potential 
foraging  habitat  for  these  species  could  be  impacted  by  building  on  the  site. 

Comment:  The  DEIS  states  that  there  are  no  known  heron/egret  rookeries  or  tern  colonies  on 
the  PSEG  site.  Importantly,  Pea  Patch  Island  is  approximately  six  nautical  miles  northwest  from 
PSEG  and  supports  the  largest  heron  rookery  in  the  Mid-Atlantic  and  perhaps  the  entire  east 
coast.  Nine  species  of  wading  birds  nest  on  Pea  Patch  island;  Black-Crowned  Night-Heron, 
Yellow-Crowned  Night-Heron;  Great  Blue  Heron;  Glossy  Ibis;  Tri-colored  heron,  Snowy  Egret, 
Great  Egret,  Little  Blue  Heron  and  Cattle  Egret.  A  Special  Area  Management  Plan  for  Pea 
Patch  Island  region  has  been  developed  to  better  manage  the  island  and  the  surrounding 
foraging  areas.  This  information  should  be  included  in  the  final  EIS  and  used  to  develop 
compensating  measures  for  the  loss  of  nesting  and  foraging  habitat.  The  plan  can  be  found 
here:  http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/coastal/Documents/PPISAMP/PPISAMPFinal1998.pdf . 
(0023-1-12  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  the  Pea  Patch  Island  rookery  In  Section  2. 4. 1.1  of  the 
EIS.  Potential  wetland  mitigation  activities  are  discussed  in  Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  Specific 
measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  will  be  further  defined  with  the 
refinement  of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization  Plan  and  once  a  reactor  technology  has  been  selected. 
These  refinements  could  continue  to  be  devised  throughout  the  design  phase  as  detailed  site 
layouts  are  developed.  Therefore,  detailed  plans  for  mitigation  are  not  possible  at  this  stage  of 
the  project.  Specific  measures  taken  to  mitigate  impacts  would  be  addressed  in  the  EIS  for  a 
COL,  if  PSEG  applies  to  NRC  for  a  COL  to  build  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
site.  The  USACE  will  include  further  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and  compensate  for  the 
unavoidable  impacts.  That  process  will  conclude  with  a  separate  decision  document,  which  will 
consist  of  a  statement  of  findings  addressing  public  interest  consistent  with  33  CFR  320-332.  It 
would  also  include  an  analysis  of  the  Section  404(b)(1)  guidelines.  In  addition,  PSEG  would  be 
reguired  to  meet  NJDEP  rules  and  regulations  pertaining  to  mitigation  activities.  Text  has  been 
added  to  Section  2. 4. 1.1  of  the  EIS  to  make  note  of  The  Pea  Patch  Island  Heronry  Region 
Special  Area  Management  Plan. 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-42;  Section  No.  4. 3. 2. 2;  Line  No.  29-31;  The  DEIS  states  "There  are 
plans  to  purchase  additional  land  to  the  north  of  the  site  ...  Once  acquired,  this  area  could  be 
considered  for  onsite  mitigation."  The  ER,  Section  4.3.1 .6.2.1 ,  page  4.3-14,  states:  "PSEG  is 
currently  in  the  process  of  acquiring  additional  acreage  to  the  north  of  the  site  ..."  PSEG  does 
not  state  anywhere  in  ER  Chapter  4  that  it  plans  to  purchase  additional  land  north  of  the  site  for 
mitigation  purposes.  (0015-2-18  [Mallon,  James])

Comment:  There  are  extensive  areas  mapped  as  Key  Wildlife  Habitat  (KWH)  in  the  Delaware 
Wildlife  Action  Plan  (DEWAP  -http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/fw/dwap/Pages/DEWAPIan.aspx) 
that  are  within  the  Vicinity  of  the  project  area.  These  areas  are  considered  KWH  either  because 
they  are  rare  within  the  state  and  have  the  potential  to  harbor  a  high  diversity  of  Species  of 
Greatest  Conservation  Need  (SGCN)  or  they  are  part  of  a  large  complex/block  that  can  support 
an  array  of  plant  and  animal  species.  KWH  documented  include:  Chestnut  Oak  -  Hairgrass 
Forest,  Early  Successional  Habitat,  Impoundments,  Mixed  Broadleaf  Freshwater  Tidal  Marsh, 
Spartina  High  Salt  Marsh,  Un-vegetated  Intertidal  Mudflats  and  Wetlands.  (0023-1-9  [Cooksey,

Response:  The  text  in  Section  2. 4. 1.3  of  the  EIS  has  been  modified  to  include  the  information 
offered  in  the  comment. 

Comment:  Table  1  (below)  includes  a  list  of  rare  species  that  occur  the  vicinity  (6  mile  radius) 
of  the  project  area  within  State  of  Delaware  boundaries.  Please  note  that  we  have  not  surveyed 
all  of  the  areas  within  Delaware  and  additional  rare  species  may  occur  within  the  vicinity  of  the 
project  area.  (0023-1-8  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  Modifications  have  been  made  to  Table  2-8  in  Section  2. 4. 1.3  of  the  EIS  based  on 
the  table  provided.  This  section  and  table  do  not  address  fish  and  sea  turtles,  which  are 
discussed  in  Section  2. 4. 2. 3  of  the  EIS. 

Comment:  What  are  the  implications  of  impacting  a  designated  wetland  mitigation  area  [along 
the  route  of  the  proposed  causeway]?  The  EEP  is  supposed  to  be  compensating  for  species 
impacts  from  the  existing  facility  by  providing  nursery  habitat  for  aquatic  species.  Degradation 
of  this  habitat  must  be  addressed.  Further,  the  compaction  of  wetland  soils  around  the 
causeway  as  a  result  of  construction  and  staging  of  materials  and  equipment  is  not  adequately 
addressed.  Compaction  could  alter  hydrology  and  the  distribution  of  plant  species.  (0023-1-18 
[Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  Discussion  of  potential  impacts  of  the  proposed  causeway  are  addressed  in 
Section  4. 3. 1. 1  of  the  EIS.  The  proposed  causeway  is  to  be  designed  as  an  elevated  structure 
to  minimize  potential  impacts  to  plant  communities.  Permanent  impacts  to  wetland  plant 
communities  along  the  causeway  would  be  limited  to  placement  of  piers  and  direct  shading. 
Construction  work  mats  are  expected  to  be  used  within  a  50- ft- wide  easement  and  will  result  in 
only  temporary  impacts.  Design  and  construction  methods  are  aimed  at  minimizing  permanent 
impacts,  over  a  conventional  road  design  that  would  involve  permanent  filling  of  wetlands.  No 
changes  have  been  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Because  the  scientific  research  on  the  value  of  Phragmites  dominated  wetlands 
was  not  discussed  or  evaluated,  the  identification  of  the  wetland  ecological  resources  and 
description  of  the  functional  attributes  of  the  wetland  ecosystems  that  could  be  affected  by  the 
proposed  project  are  inadequate  (Section  2.4  Ecology).  Until  the  value  of  the  impacted  sites 
has  been  fully  evaluated,  the  conclusions  and  the  determinations  of  the  impact  category  levels 
are  also  inadequate  and  inaccurate  (Section  4.1  ).  (0020-2-18  [van  Rossum,  Maya])

NUREG-2168 


Appendix  E 


Response:  The  NRC  staff  fully  evaluates  potential  impacts  to  wetlands  as  an  integral  part  of 
the  EIS  process.  The  NRC  staff  discusses  wetland  impacts  and  potential  mitigation  activities  in 
Section  4.3  of  the  EIS.  in  this  section  it  is  noted  that  any  wetlands  are  considered  to  be 
important  habitat  and  alteration  of  wetlands  resulting  from  this  project  will  be  noticeable.  It  is 
further  stated  in  Section  4.3. 1.4  of  the  EIS  that  wetlands  are  considered  to  be  an  important 
terrestrial  habitat  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  provide  habitat  for  wildlife  that  frequent  the  area. 
However,  as  stated  in  the  draft  EIS,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  Phragmites  that  dominates 
these  communities  is  invasive  and  non -native,  and  to  the  detriment  of  native  wetland 
communities.  No  changes  have  been  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  DEIS  uses  a  scientific  paper  that,  in  my  estimation,  downplays  the  avian  and 
bat  mortality  caused  by  turbines,  by  comparing  the  rates  to  millions  killed  by  other  human 
causes.  It  fails  to  mention  that  the  same  NRC  paper  states  that  there  are  other  indirect  impacts 
on  birds  and  bats.  Indeed,  a  great  deal  of  the  bird  mortality  occurs  in  urban  areas,  where 
thousands  of  communal  birds,  such  as  house  sparrows,  that  are  not  even  native,  feral  cats  and 
tall  buildings  with  lots  of  glass,  etcetera.  But  why  would  we  add  another  threat?  Especially  if 
that  threat  is  not  justified  by  an  unreliable  source  of  energy?  I  agree  that  measuring  the  number 
of  birds  killed  in  the  urban  areas  is  far  greater  than  the  number  of  birds  and  bats  killed  by  wind 
turbines.  However,  the  number  of  turbines,  since  2008,  when  the  study  was  conducted,  has 
grown  substantially,  and  is  projected  to  grow  in  the  future.  Therefore  it  follows  that  the  number 
of  bird  and  bat  fatalities  has  grown  since  then  and  will  continue  to  grow,  a  well.  I  also  question 
how  accurate  the  bird  and  bat  fatalities  were,  when  each  turbine  site  is  not  monitored  by 
humans  on  a  daily  basis.  Scavenging  predators  could  change  the  count  before  humans  can  be 
on  site  to  make  an  accurate  count.  (0004-12-3  [Eastman,  Alice  (Ajax)]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  analysis  in  Section  9.2.2. 7  discusses  the  effect  of  wind  turbines  on 
avian  and  bat  mortalities.  The  estimated  mortalities  were  based  on  available  scientific  literature 
and  are  designed  to  be  a  conservative  comparison  between  nuclear  power  plants  and  wind 
turbines.  The  NRC  staff  acknowledges  that  additional  studies  have  been  completed  and  that 
estimations  of  avian  and  bat  mortalities  have  indicated  a  significant  increase  in  collisions  with 
wind  turbines.  However,  the  new  information  does  not  change  the  conclusion  that  a  wind 
energy  facility  at  the  PSEG  Site  or  elsewhere  within  the  PSEG  ROI  is  not  currently  a  reasonable 
alternative  to  construction  of  a  2 200- MW (e)  nuclear  generation  facility  that  would  be  operated 
as  a  baseload  plant.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Even  more  disturbing,  according  to  the  renowned  ornithologist  Chandler  Robbins, 
who  has  spent  more  than  50  years  studying  migrating  birds  in  western  Maryland,  those 
Appalachian  ridges,  being  targeted  for  industrial  wind  installations,  are  the  major  flyway  for 
migrating  neo-tropical  birds.  They  congregate  from  their  summer  breeding  grounds  in  Canada, 
and  North  America,  along  those  ridges  as  they  head  to  their  wintering  grounds  in  Central  and 
South  America.  (0004-12-4  [Eastman,  Alice  (Ajax)]) 

Comment:  These  birds  are  already  declining  due  to  loss  of  both  winter  habitat  and  summer 
breeding  habitats.  In  fact,  the  forest  and  ridges  of  western  Maryland  are  mostly  unfragmented, 
and  provide  habitat  necessary  for  their  successful  breeding.  Fragmented  forests  provide  edges 
that  are  favored  by  nest  predators,  such  as  the  brown  headed  cow  birds.  Industrial  wind  sites

necessitate  the  fragmentation  of  long  small  songbirds'  nesting  territories,  adding  to  the 
diminishing  of  their  species.  (0004-12-5  [Eastman.  Alice  (Ajax)]) 

Response:  These  comments  do  not  provide  new  information  for  the  environmental  review 
done  for  the  EIS.  No  changes  have  been  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  [The  NJDEP  Endangered  &  Non-game  Species  Program  (ENSP)]  has  attached  a 
few  pages  from  [Table  M  in  the  Reader's  Guide]  that  summarizes  the  "unavoidable  impacts"  but 
those  numbers  are  different  from  another  section  that  summarizes  this  way:  (1 )  430  acres  on 
PSEG  site  &  vicinity,  of  which  225  will  be  permanently  disturbed  (lost)  and  205  temporarily 
disturbed.  Loss  of  PSEG's  CDF,  which  may  require  ACE  to  build  another  CDF  in  the  region. 

(2)  Causeway:  69  acres  disturbed  of  which  46  would  be  permanent  and  23  ac  temporary.  The 
road  crosses  Alloways  Creek  wetlands,  Abbott's  Meadow  WMA  and  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA. 
ENSP  concerns  include:  (a)  Loss  of  marsh  habitat  for  marsh  species  (N.  harrier,  black  rail, 
sedge  wren,  short-eared  owl,  bald  eagle,  shorebirds,  etc.)  (b)  Disturbance,  mortality,  and  other 
secondary  effects  of  a  new  roadway  across  marsh  (all  marsh  species).  (0021-3-2  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  first  set  of  numbers  does  not  actually  state  acreages  for  temporary 
disturbance;  the  second  set  of  numbers  states  those  acreages.  That  represents  the  difference  in 
these  two  sets  of  numbers.  Tables  4-  1  and  4-2  of  the  EIS  provide  further  details  on  these 
acreages.  Discussion  of  potential  impacts  of  the  proposed  causeway  are  addressed  in  Section 
4. 3. 7.7  of  the  EIS.  The  proposed  causeway  is  to  be  designed  as  an  elevated  structure  to 
minimize  potential  impacts  to  plant  communities  and  wildlife  habitat.  Permanent  impacts  to 
wetland  plant  communities  along  the  causeway  would  be  limited  to  placement  of  piers  and 
direct  shading.  Construction  work  mats  are  expected  to  be  used  within  a  50-ft-wide  easement 
and  will  result  in  only  temporary  impacts.  Design  and  construction  methods  are  aimed  at 
minimizing  permanent  impacts,  over  a  conventional  road  design  that  would  involve  permanent 
filling  of  wetlands.  No  changes  have  been  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-108:  Section  No.  4.12;  Table  4-21;  ER  Section  4. 3. 1.6. 2  indicates 
PSEG  intends  to  provide  full  compensatory  mitigation  for  wetland  impacts.  Mitigation  ratios 
from  permit  conditions  will  prescribe  compensation  associated  with  wetland  type,  temporal 
losses,  etc.  Suggest  this  sentence  be  reworded  to  indicate  that  proposed  compensatory  actions 
will  mitigate  the  impacts  (delete  "could  offset  some  of  the  impacts.").  (0015-3-10  [Mailon,  James]) 

Response:  An  editorial  change  has  been  made  to  Table  4-21  of  the  EIS  [Table  4-22  of  the  final 
EIS]. 

Comment:  Page  No.  10-6:  Section  No.  10.2.1;  Table  10-1;  Under  Terrestrial  and  Wetland 
Resources,  the  table  states  that  temporary  disturbance  would  include  20.1  acres  of  wetland 
habitat,  but  line  39  on  Page  10-10  states  that  1 9.6  acres  of  wetland  habitat  would  be  temporarily 
disturbed.  Table  4.2  also  states  that  temporary  disturbance  would  include  19.6  acres  of  wetland 
habitat.  (0015-7-4  [Mailon,  James]) 

Response:  Sections  3.3. 1,  4.3. 1.2,  and  10.2. 1  (Table  10-1)  of  the  EIS  have  been  revised  to 
state  that  the  causeway  will  result  in  the  temporary  disturbance  of  19.6  ac  of  wetlands.

Comment:  Page  No.  10-13;  Section  No.  10.2.2;  Table  10-2;  Under  Ecological  Impacts- 
Terrestrial  and  Wetland  Resources,  the  table  states  that  permanent  disturbance  on  the  site 
includes  1 26  acres  of  wetland  habitat  and  9  acres  of  old  field.  Line  24  on  page  1 0-1 2  and 
elsewhere  in  the  DEIS  state  that  108  acres  of  wetland  habitat  will  be  permanently  disturbed. 
(0015-7-8  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  Sections  4. 3. 1.2  and  1 0.2.2  (Table  10-2)  of  the  EIS  have  been  revised  to  state  that 
108  ac  of  onsite  wetlands  will  be  permanently  disturbed. 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-33;  Section  No.  4. 3. 1.2;  Line  No.  4-6;  Change  "...  construction-related 
impacts  would  include  65.2  ac  of  unmapped  ..."to  "...  construction-related  impacts  would 
include  90  ac  of  unmapped  ..."  (see  ER  Subsection  4.3.1 .3.1 .2).  (0015-2-15  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  As  this  sentence  is  referring  to  the  CDF/disposal  basin  wetlands,  90  ac  is  the 
correct  acreage  to  use  in  this  context.  The  EIS  has  been  revised  to  reflect  this  change. 

Comment:  The  ecological  effects  of  the  proposed  wetland  fill  are  not  adequately  addressed  in 
Section  4.0.  The  effects  are  only  viewed  on  the  large  scale  of  the  estuary  as  a  whole.  The 
effects  on  individual  watersheds  such  as  the  Alloway  Creek  and  Mad  Horse  Creek  watersheds 
or  individual  Wildlife  Management  Areas  are  not  considered.  This  broad  scale  view 
inappropriately  diminishes  the  local  effects  of  habitat  loss  and  degradation  that  would  result 
from  the  construction  of  the  facility.  (0018-1-7  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  Potential  impacts  to  adjacent  Wildlife  Management  Areas  (\ A/M  As)  are  discussed  in 
Sections  4. 3. 1.2  and  5. 3. 1.2  of  the  EIS.  Any  potential  impacts  to  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA, 
Abbotts  Meadow  WMA,  Alloway  Creek,  and  accompanying  watersheds  would  be  associated 
with  the  proposed  causeway.  This  causeway  would  be  elevated  above  the  surface  through 
these  areas,  and  the  flow  of  water  through  wetlands  and  open  water  is  not  expected  to  be 
affected.  Less  than  1  ac  of  the  WMAs  is  expected  to  be  affected,  which  is  less  than  1  percent  of 
the  total  available  WMAs.  Therefore,  the  impacts  of  constructing  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  important  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitats  and  on  these  WMAs 
and  associated  watersheds  are  expected  to  be  minimal.  No  changes  have  been  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  In  Chapter  5  it  is  stated  that  avian  mortality  as  a  result  of  collision  with  natural  draft 
cooling  tower  design  could  occur,  but  would  not  result  in  a  significant  decline  in  avian 
populations.  This  statement  is  supported  by  reference  to  an  NRC  publication  (NRC  2013- 
TN2654).  This  cited  document  is  entitled  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License 
Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants  (GEIS)  Revision  1,  Volume  1  (Main  Report),  Washington,  D.C. 
Accession  No  ML13106A241.  A  generic  EIS  is  insufficient  to  use  as  evidence  that  avian 
impacts  in  the  Atlantic  flyway  are  minimal.  The  final  EIS  should  substantiate  this  claim  with 
peer-reviewed  journal  publications.  (0023-2-1  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  avian  mortality  at  the  PSEG  Site  as  a  result  of  operations 
in  Section  5.3. 1. 1  of  the  EIS.  To  facilitate  the  environmental  review  for  license  renewal,  the 
NRC  staff  has  codified  its  findings  regarding  potential  environmental  impacts  as  documented  in 
the  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants  (GEIS).

Appendix  E 


The  GEIS  examines  the  possible  environmental  impacts  that  could  occur  as  a  result  of  renewing 
any  commercial  nuclear  power  plant  license,  and,  to  the  extent  possible,  establishes  the  bounds 
and  significance  of  these  potential  impacts.  The  2013  GEIS  Revision  1  (as  referenced  in  the 
comment)  identifies  78  environmental  impact  issues  for  consideration  in  license  renewal 
environmental  reviews,  59  of  which  have  been  determined  to  be  generic  to  all  plant  sites.  The 
generic  impacts  are  addressed  and  resolved  (with  respect  to  their  impact  level)  wholly  within  the 
GEIS.  The  impacts  which  are  identified  as  not  generic  are  subsequently  examined  in  a  site- 
specific  environmental  review  for  the  plant  seeking  the  license  renewal. 

The  impacts  from  birds  colliding  with  cooling  towers  and  transmission  lines  were  evaluated  in 
the  GEIS  by  reviewing  the  primary  literature  for  avian  collision  mortality  associated  with  all  types 
of  human-made  objects,  as  well  as  the  results  of  monitoring  studies  conducted  at  six  nuclear 
plants.  The  available  data  on  cooling  tower  collision  mortality  suggest  that  cooling  towers  at 
nuclear  power  plants  cause  only  a  very  small  fraction  of  the  total  annual  bird  collision  mortality 
from  all  sources.  Because  the  frequency  of  avian  mortality  resulting  from  collisions  with  cooling 
towers  is  small  for  any  species,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  losses  would  threaten  the  stability  of  local 
migratory  bird  populations  or  result  in  a  noticeable  impairment  of  the  function  of  a  species  within 
local  ecosystems.  Based  on  this  information,  the  GEIS  concluded  that  avian  mortality  from 
collisions  with  plant  structures  and  transmission  lines  during  the  license  renewal  term  would 
meet  the  criteria  of  Category  1,  and  hence,  no  additional  plant-specific  analysis  is  required  in 
future  site-specific  environmental  reviews  for  relicensing,  unless  new  and  significant  information 
is  identified.  In  its  environmental  review  of  the  PSEG  ESP  application,  the  NRC  staff  relied 
upon  the  findings  and  conclusions  of  the  GEIS  and  avian  mortality  observations  made  by 
PSEG;  hence,  no  changes  were  made  to  this  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  7. 3. 1.1,  pages  7-19/20:  concludes  that  "The  effects  on  terrestrial  and 
wetland  habitat  would  be  expected  to  be  less  than,  but  consistent  with,  those  of  the  Delaware 
River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project."  This  is  incorrect  -since  the  Delaware  River  Main 
Channel  Deepening  Project  did  not  require  the  construction  of  any  new  upland  CDFs,  and  it 
appears  one  or  more  new  upland  CDFs  are  needed  to  support  the  proposed  PSEG  project, 
associated  impacts  resulting  from  the  PSEG  project  are  not  consistent  with  -  and  would 
potentially  be  greater  than  those  associated  with  the  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening 
Project.  Thus,  it  is  not  possible  for  the  NRC  review  team  to  conclude  that  "the  cumulative 
impact  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecology  habitats  from  dredging  activities  as  a  result  of  building 
and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  site  in  conjunction  with  past,  present,  and 
reasonably  foreseeable  dredging  activities  would  be  minimal."  (0021-4-16  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  USACE  has  evaluated  the  potential  environmental  impacts  of  developing  a 
new  upland  CDF  to  replace  the  dredge  disposal  capacity  it  would  lose  at  the  north  end  of 
Artificial  Island  in  the  proposed  land  exchange  with  PSEG  (USACE  20! 4-  TN4229),  and  those 
impacts  were  found  to  be  minimal.  The  volume  of  material  to  be  dredged  for  the  new  intake 
structure,  discharge  structure,  and  barge  facility  at  the  PSEG  Site  (i.e.,  665,000  yd3,  see  draft 
EIS  Section  4.2. 1)  would  be  only  about  7  percent  of  the  total  volume  of  material  to  be  dredged 
(i.e.,  65  million  yd3,  see  draft  EIS  Section  2. 12)  during  the  USACE's  Delaware  River  Main 
Channel  Deepening  Project.  The  dredged  material  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  would  be  disposed  of  onsite  or  at  an  approved  upland  disposal  facility.  The  text  in 
Section  7.3.1.!  of  the  EIS  has  been  revised  to  add  these  clarifications.  In  addition,  the  sentence

referenced  in  the  comment  has  been  revised  in  this  EIS  to  indicate  that  the  effects  on  terrestrial 
and  wetland  habitat  would  be  similar  to  and  consistent  with,  those  of  the  Channel  Deepening 
Project.  The  review  team's  conclusions  regarding  potential  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  and 
wetlands  did  not  change  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

E.2.10  Comments  Concerning  Aquatic  Ecology 

Comment:  In  looking  at  the  proposed  new  construction  on  the  PSEG  Site,  I  will  be  speaking 
primarily  to  specific  projected  ecological  impacts  on  local  aquatic  systems.  The  natural  systems 
of  Delaware  River  and  Estuary  are  critical  environments  with  major  significance  for  both  regional 
and  global  biodiversity,  for  regional  water  supply  and  water  quality,  and  for  supporting  important 
economic  activities.  Construction  on  the  scale  proposed  by  PSEG  on  the  Delaware  coast 
requires  careful  consideration  of  environmental  factors.  (0001-2  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Comment:  In  looking  at  the  proposed  new  construction  at  the  PSEG  site  I  will  be  speaking, 
primarily,  to  the  specific  projected  ecological  impacts  on  local  aquatic  systems.  The  natural

for  both  regional  and  global  biodiversity,  for  regional  water  quality  supply,  and  water  quality,  and 
for  supporting  important  economic  activities.  Construction  on  a  scale  proposed  by  PSEG,  on

Comment:  The  natural  systems  of  the  Delaware  River  and  estuary  are  critical  environments 
with  major  significance  for  both  regional  and  global  biodiversity,  for  regional  water  supply,  and 
water  quality,  and  for  supporting  important  economic  activities.  Construction  on  the  scale 
proposed  by  PSEG  on  the  Delaware  coast  requires  careful  consideration  of  the  environmental 
factors.  (0007-9-2  [Wall,  Roland]) 

Response:  The  commenters  describe  the  importance  of  consideration  of  impacts  to  aguatic 
resources  from  construction.  Section  4.3.2  of  the  EIS  describes  building  activities  and  effects  to 
aquatic  resources.  These  comments  provide  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and 
therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Before  addressing  the  new  construction,  I  would  point  out  PSEG's  past  efforts  to 
mitigate  the  effects  of  its  operations  on  the  aquatic  environment  in  the  Salem  vicinity.  In 
particular,  faced  with  concerns  of  negative  impacts  on  fisheries  by  cooling  water  intake 
operations,  PSEG  responded  with  the  largest  private  wetlands  restoration  project  in  the  Nation. 
The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  began  in  1994  and  since  that  time  has  been  a  large  scale 
effort  to  restore  and  preserve  portions  of  the  Delaware  Estuary  in  both  New  Jersey  and 
Delaware.  PSEG  has  restored,  enhanced,  and/or  preserved  more  than  20,000  acres  of  salt 
marsh  and  adjacent  uplands  to  vital,  healthy  habitat  for  fish  and  wildlife.  (0001-3  [Velinsky,  David])

effort  to  restore  and  preserve  portions  of  the  Delaware  Estuary  in  both  New  Jersey  and 
Delaware.  PSEG  has  restored,  enhanced  and/or  preserved  more  than  20,000  acres  of  salt 
marsh,  and  adjacent  wetlands  to  vital  healthy  habitat  for  fish  and  wildlife.  (0004-1 1  -3  [Velinsky, 
David]) 

Comment:  Since  then  I  have  followed,  with  my  students  and  with  great  interest,  what  has 
become  the  largest  privately  financed  estuary  enhancement  project  in  the  nation.  Without  going 
into  details  the  project  has  been  a  resounding  success,  at  many  levels,  and  increasing  the 
resource  value  of  large  acreages  throughout  the  bay.  PSEG  has  a  solid  track  record  in 
delivering  on  their  commitment  to  bay-wide  health.  (0004-4-6  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  And  I  will  mention  one  example,  in  particular.  And  it  has  to  do  with  the  Estuary 
Enhancement  program  that  was  developed,  perhaps,  about  15  years  ago,  now.  And  it  is, 
perhaps,  one  of  the  largest  estuarine  restoration  programs  undertaken  in  our  nation.  And  it  set 
out  to  restore  20,000  acres  of  wetlands,  very  important  habitat,  20,000  acres  of  wetlands  to 
natural  tidal  flow  and  function.  And  that  led  to  an  increase  in  production  of  fin  fish  and  shellfish 
to  the  Delaware  River  and  bay  system.  That  cost  a  lot  of  money.  They  brought  in  the  experts  to 
do  that,  from  a  variety  of  institutions,  up  and  down  the  coast.  (0006-6-3  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Comment:  Without  PSEG’s  work  there  would  be  much  less  productive  marsh  habitat  providing 
nutrient  cycling  and  aquatic  animal  nursery  roles  in  this  important  system.  (0006-8-2  [Duvau, 
Bryan]) 

Response:  The  commenters  acknowledge  the  past  efforts  of  PSEG  to  restore  and  preserve 
aquatic  habitats  near  SGS  and  the  PSEG  Site.  These  comments  provide  no  new  information 
for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these 
comments. 

Comment:  In  addition  to  the  steps  being  taken  to  protect  the  wetlands  impacted  by 
construction,  the  aquatic  impacts  of  the  proposed  facility  will  be  limited  by  the  use  of  a  closed 
cycle  cooling  system.  Compared  to  a  once-through  system,  these  cooling  towers  will  divert 
much  less  water  for  cooling.  Projected  maximum  diversion  for  the  new  facility  is  less  than  4% 
depending  on  the  type  of  facility  of  the  current  use  by  Salem,  and  is  less  than  0.05%  of  the  total 
volume  of  the  Delaware  River  flow.  As  a  result,  impingement  of  fish  populations  will  be  a  small 
fraction  of  the  current  level  of  the  Salem  station.  (0001-8  [Velinsky,  David])

construction,  the  aquatic  impacts  of  the  proposed  facility  will  be  limited  by  the  use  of  a  closed 
cycle  cooling  system,  compared  to  the  once  through  system,  these  cooling  towers  will  divert 
much  less  water  for  cooling,  much  less  for  cooling.  Projected  maximum  diversion,  for  the  new 
facility,  is  less  than  four  percent,  depending  on  the  type  of  facility  of  the  current  use,  by  Salem, 
and  less  than  .05  percent  of  the  total  volume  of  the  Delaware  River  flow.  As  a  result  the 
impingement  of  fish  populations  will  be  a  small  fraction  of  the  current  level  of  the  Salem  Station.

cycle  cooling  system,  compared  to  the  once-through  system.  These  cooling  towers  will  divert 
much  less  cool  water  for  cooling,  projected  maximum  diversion,  for  the  new  facility,  is  seen  as 
less  than  four  percent  of  the  current  use  of  Salem,  as  less  than  .05  percent  of  the  total  volume 
of  the  Delaware  River  flow.  As  a  result  impingement  on  fish  populations  will  be  a  small  fraction 
of  the  current  level  of  the  Salem  station.  (0007-9-8  [Wall,  Roland]) 

Response:  The  commenters  acknowledge  the  expected  reduction  in  water  use  and 
impingement  offish  at  the  new  plant.  These  comments  provide  no  new  information  for 
consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  comments  appearing  in  Federal  Actions  for  a  Climate  Resilient  Nation , 
Progress  Report  was  issued  by  the  Interagency  Climate  Change  Adaptation  Task  Force  on  28 
October  201 1  included  highlighting  the  use  of  coastal  wetlands  as  "green  infrastructure"  for 
storm  buffering  and  to  contribute  to  the  success  of  the  nation's  fisheries.  (0002-2  [Weinstein, 
Michael]) 

Response:  The  commenter  acknowledges  the  importance  of  coastal  wetlands  in  general.  This 
comment  provides  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were  made 
to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Thus,  long  after  these  Artificial  Island  power  plants  and  their  infrastructure  are 
gone,  EEP's  wetlands  will  continue  to  serve  both  of  these  critical  ecological  and  societal 
functions,  and  not  only  produce  fish  and  shellfish  of  the  "right  kind",  in  copious  numbers,  but  will 
also  help  protect  people  and  property  in  the  region  against  storm  related  impacts.  (0002-4 
[Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Comment:  So  long  after  the  Artificial  Island  power  plants,  and  their  infrastructure  are  gone, 
including  those  horrible  looking  cooling  towers,  EEP  wetlands  will  continue  to  serve  these 
critical  ecological  and  societal  functions.  And  not  only  produce  fish  and  shellfish  of  the  right 
kind,  but  in  copious  numbers.  It  will  also  help  protect  people  and  property  in  the  region,  again, 
against  the  advent  of  more  severe  storm  events.  (0004-9-5  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Response:  The  commenters  acknowledge  the  importance  of  coastal  wetlands  in  general  and 
for  the  PSEG  Site.  These  comments  provide  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and 
therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  nuclear  operations  at  PSEG  already  has  on  Artificial  Island,  already  inflict  an 
incredibly  harmful  burden  on  the  resources  of  the  Delaware  Estuary.  For  example,  the  over  3 
billion  Delaware  River  fish,  a  year,  that  they  kill  needlessly,  with  a  simple  change  in  operation, 
they  could  reduce  their  fish  kills  by  over  95  percent,  but  they  choose  not  to  do  so.  (0004-3-2  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  We  believe  that,  before  PSEG  should  be  allowed  to  construct  another  burdensome 
facility  on  Artificial  Island,  or  anywhere  within  the  Delaware  Estuary  before  it  is  even  considered, 
they  must  be  forced  to  minimize  the  adverse  environmental  impact  their  existing  facilities 
already  have.  Including  their  fish  kills,  their  harmful  imprint  on  our  wetlands,  the  water  quality 
impacts  they  have  on  the  Delaware  Estuary  waters,  and  more.  (0004-3-3  [van  Rossum,  Maya])

Comment:  And  how  about  the  impact  to  the  environment?  The  Delaware  Riverkeeper  Network 
works  to  protect  and  enhance  the  Delaware  River,  and  the  lands  that  drain  into  it.  We  take  that 
role  very  seriously.  You  could  say  that  we  speak  for  the  fish.  Well,  if  the  fish  could  speak,  right 
now,  they  would  tell  you  that  another  nuclear  power  plant  would  not  be  good  for  their  future. 
Already,  already,  millions  offish  are  being  constantly  killed,  by  PSEG,  and  its  cooling  water 
intakes  used  for  the  existing  plants.  Some  of  those  fish  are  endangered  species.  And  it  will 
only  get  worse  with  one  more  nuclear  plant  sucking  ever  more  water,  and  ever  more  fish.  (0006- 
4-11  [Brook,  David]) 

Response:  These  comments  are  not  specific  in  identifying  what  might  have  an  impact  on 
aguatic  ecosystems  from  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  EIS 
addresses  impacts  on  aquatic  ecosystems  from  preparation,  construction,  and  operation  of  the 
proposed  plant  in  Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2.  Cumulative  effects  from  the  operation  of  a  new 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  addressed  in  Section  7.3.2,  and  describe  the  significantly  reduced 
volume  of  water  for  closed-cycle  cooling  that  the  new  units  would  use  compared  to  the 
operation  of  SGS  which  uses  once-through  cooling.  The  review  team  concluded  that  the  impact 
on  the  aquatic  ecosystem  would  be  SMALL.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  in  response  to 
these  comments. 

Comment:  Returning  to  the  purpose  of  this  meeting,  should  this  project  move  ahead  toward 
construction,  there  will  be  on  site  habitat  impacts  that  will  be  unavoidable.  And  I  urge  that  the 
process  to  embrace  the  same  bay-wide  approach  used  in  the  estuarian  enhancement  program, 
and  to  be  creative  and  aggressive  in  identifying  off-site  mitigation  opportunities.  Hold  PSEG's 
feet  to  the  fire.  History  suggests  that  they  will  deliver.  (0004-4-8  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Response:  The  commenter  expresses  concern  regarding  construction  impacts.  Aquatic 
resource  impacts  from  construction  are  described  in  Section  4.3.2,  and  terrestrial  and  wetland 
impacts,  including  mitigation,  are  discussed  in  Section  4.3. 7.  This  comment  provides  no  new 
information  for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of 
this  comment. 

Comment:  In  addition,  the  increasing  C02  concentrations,  in  the  atmosphere,  are  causing 
elevated  ocean  acidification,  which  is  drastically  affecting  the  aquatic  food  chain  and  will  result 
in  world-wide  food  shortages.  Deleterious  effects  of  acidification  have  already  been 
documented  in  shellfish  aquaculture  in  the  Pacific  Northwest.  (0004-7-4  [Meadow,  Karen]) 

Comment:  Finally,  increasing  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  in  the  atmosphere,  are  acidifying  the 
ocean,  which  is  dramatically  affecting  the  aquatic  food  chain,  and  will  result,  or  could  result  in 
world-wide  food  shortages.  Deleterious  effects  of  acidification  have  already  been  documented 
in  shellfish  aquaculture  in  the  Pacific  Northwest.  (0007-6-10  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Response:  The  commenters  state  concerns  regarding  increasing  acidification  in  general  and 
cite  an  example  of  adverse  effects  in  the  Pacific  Northwest.  These  comments  provide  no  new 
information  for  consideration  of  impacts  from  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments.

Comment:  One  of  the  things  about  this  project,  that  caught  my  attention,  was  the  fact  that  they 
are  going  to  plan  to  use  an  elevated  roadway  to  access  the  nuclear  plant.  In  the  past  what 
people  did  was  build  up  a  roadway  across  the  meadow.  And  that  would  involve,  literally,  tons 
and  tons  of  fill,  and  emplacement  of  culverts  and  bridges.  The  intent  was  to  get  the  vehicles  in 
and  out,  without  being  flooded  out  by  high  tide.  The  problem  with  that  is  that,  even  though,  you 
haven't  technically  altered  the  marsh,  other  than  that  which  is  underneath  the  footprint,  in  reality 
you  have  restricted  the  tidal  flow.  And  once  you  restrict  the  tidal  flow  the  area  no  longer 
functions  as  the  same  type  of  marsh  that  it  once  was.  This  enables  it  to  be  more  attractive  to 
invasive  plants,  such  as  phragmites,  also  known  as  common  reed  in  this  area.  And,  at  the 
same  time,  it  reduces  the  amount  of  flow,  and  that  means  that  there  is  less  fish  using  the  marsh. 
Today  we  have  another  alternative,  and  that  is  the  elevated  roadway.  The  one  that  PSEG  has 
proposed  is  going  to  be,  at  least,  ten  feet  above  the  surface  of  the  marsh.  By  doing  this  it  is 
going  to,  one,  not  impact  the  marsh  except  where  the  piers  come  into  the  marsh  itself.  The  fact 
that  it  is  ten  feet  above  will  also  reduce  the  amount  of  shading  that  comes  on,  underneath.  And 
thus  not  inhibit  the  growth  of  plants.  When  you  get  big  tides,  or  even  just  the  tide  that  you  get 
during  the  normal  full  moon,  you  are  going  to  have  water  flowing  all  the  way  across  that  area. 

But  it  will  be  underneath  the  roadway,  and  it  will  not  be  blocked  by  the  roadway  itself.  With  that 
you  are  going  to  have  a  much  better  situation,  you  will  be  able  to  get  vehicles  in  and  out.  And, 
at  the  same  time,  you  will  not  have  a  major  impact  on  the  meadow.  (0006-7-1  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Response:  The  commenter  acknowledges  the  benefits  of  the  proposed  elevated  causeway  to 
lessen  impacts  to  marsh  habitat  and  aquatic  resources.  This  comment  provides  no  new 
information  for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of 
this  comment. 

Comment:  We  continue  to  be  concerned  about  the  fish  impingement.  It  says  you  are 
coordinating,  we  are  going  to  review  that  data.  We  had  lots  of  data  that  said  there  were  no 
impacts  to  sturgeon.  Guess  what?  You  were  wrong.  We  have  now  confirmed  sturgeon,  an 
endangered  species,  are  being  hit  by  the  existing  intakes.  Even  if  it  is  a  modest  increase,  it  is 
still  a  large  volume  of  water.  That  needs  to  be  more  adequately  addressed  throughout  this. 
(0007-2-13  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  There  are  three  main  concerns  that  I  have  about  your  proposal.  They  are  waste 
disposal;  fish  and  marine  creatures  kills;  and  safety  ....  The  fish  and  other  marine  creatures 
kills  at  your  water  intakes  are  inexcusable.  Your  'once  through'  cooling  systems,  as  at  Salem, 
are  abuses  of  river  creatures.  No  wonder  the  fish  catch  has  lessened!  .  .  .  We  are  abusing  the 
Delaware  river!  (0019-4  [Passmore,  Wills]) 

Response:  The  comments  are  not  specific  in  identifying  how  operation  of  a  new  intake  at  the 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  adversely  affect  fish  impingement.  The  EIS  addresses  impacts  on 
aquatic  resources,  including  Federally  protected  species,  from  intake  operations  of  the 
proposed  plant  in  Section  5. 3.2.  The  review  team  concluded  that  the  impact  on  aquatic 
resources  from  operations  would  be  SMALL.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  in  response  to 
these  comments. 

Comment:  I  was  unclear,  with  the  water  intake,  it  says  you  will  meet  the  requirements, 
particularly  for  the  fish  issue.  But  I  think,  much  like  the  data  used  for  the  population,  I'm  not

Appendix  E 


sure  which  data  you  are  using.  In  August  the  Federal  Register  came  out  with  new  16(b) 
regulations.  So  if  this  EIS  is  based  on  what  came  prior,  versus  now,  it  needs  to  be  completely 
re-written,  based  on  the  new  regulations  that  are  coming  out,  because  that  will  be  the  future.  It 
should  be  what  you  are  adhering  to  and  you  need  to  follow  those  laws.  (0007-2-14  [Carter, 

David]) 

Response:  The  commenter  is  concerned  that  the  newest  revision  of  regulations  under  Section 
316(b)  of  the  CWA  (Phase  II  Rule,  existing  facilities)  was  not  used  to  assess  fish  impacts  for  the 
proposed  plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site.  The  EIS  addresses  impacts  on  aquatic  resources,  including 
fish,  from  intake  operations  of  the  proposed  plant  in  Section  5.3.2,  using  the  most  recent  316(b) 
regulations  for  Phase  /  (new  facilities)  as  required  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency 
(EPA).  The  review  team  concluded  that  the  impact  on  aquatic  resources  from  operations  would 
be  SMALL.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  An  example  of  that  and  one  of  the  little-known  facts,  is  that  PSEG  constructed  a 
total  of  1 3  fish  ladders  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  But  that  nine  of  those  were  in  Delaware, 
as  they  had  the  highest  probability  of  successfully  reestablishing  river  herring  spawning  habitat. 
(0008-1-3  [Pantazes,  Jeff]) 

Comment:  As  you  may  or  may  not  know,  PSEG  has  constructed,  and  continues  to  monitor 
nine  fish  ladders  in  the  state  of  Delaware,  on  several  tributaries  in  New  Castle  and  in  Kent 
County.  The  northernmost  fish  ladder  is  just  around  the  corner,  here  in  Noxingtown  pond. 
Southernmost  provides  fish  access  to  Silver  Lake  at  Millford  and  Kent  County  Delaware.  Again, 
the  success  of  these  fish  ladders  has  been  made  possible  by  the  input  provided  by  local 
communities,  both  in  New  Castle  County,  and  in  Kent  County,  as  well  as  the  support  from  the 
Delaware  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environmental  Control  fisheries  biologists. 
(0008-2-11  [Evans,  Brenda]) 

Response:  The  commenters  acknowledge  the  past  efforts  of  PSEG  to  fish  migration  by 
installing  fish  ladders.  These  comments  provide  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and 
therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Another  often  overlooked  subtlety  is  that  the  biological  data  collected,  under  the 
Estuary  Enhancement  Program,  for  the  last  20  years,  is  provided  annually  to  Delaware 
Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environmental  Control  (DNREC),  New  Jersey 
Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP),  and  the  federal  regulatory  agencies,  for  their 
review  and  use.  It  is  one  of  the  most  complete  and  consistent  aquatic  biology  data  sets  in 
existence  for  the  Delaware  River.  And  it  complements  the  data  collected  by  DNREC  and 
NJDEP,  under  their  fishery  management  programs,  and  helps  to  assure  that  there  is  a 
consistent,  and  comprehensive  understanding  of  that  information.  (0008-1-5  [Pantazes,  Jeff]) 

Response:  The  commenter  acknowledges  the  significant  amount  of  biological  information 
collected  through  the  EEP  and  made  available  to  other  agencies  to  use  for  aquatic  management 
of  resources.  This  comment  provides  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment.

Appendix  E 


Comment:  A  new  plant  will  provide  an  excellent  opportunity  to  incorporate  new  technology  to 
produce  cleaner,  safer  energy  especially  if  a  cooling  tower  is  incorporated  to  significantly  reduce 
bay  water  usage,  the  impingement  and  entrainment  of  aquatic  biota,  and  the  impact  of  large 
quantities  of  elevated  temperature  water  reentering  the  estuary.  I  know  of  no  scientific  study 
that  proves  that  the  present  cooling  process  at  Salem  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  estuary. 
(0009-6  [Locandro,  Roger]) 

Response:  The  commenter  acknowledges  the  use  of  closed-cycle  cooling  technology  to 
reduce  impacts  to  aquatic  resources,  and  the  general  condition  of  the  estuary.  This  comment 
provides  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS 
as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  As  a  fisherman,  I  can  tell  you  there  are  very  few  fish  in  the  water  for  miles  around 
the  plant.  The  warm  water,  incorrect  PH,  huge  intake  screens,  and  cleaning  chemicals  dumped 
in  the  river  have  compromised  safe  fishing  in  the  whole  area.  I've  read  all  your  reports  on  the 
fish  in  the  water  in  this  area  and  can't  believe  a  group  of  government  employees  can  be  so 
wrong  and  allow  such  dishonesty.  (0011-5  [Keating,  Thomas]) 

Response:  The  commenter  is  concerned  with  water  quality  and  poor  fishing  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  proposed  plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site.  The  EIS  characterizes  the  historic  and  current  status  of 
fish  populations  in  the  vicinity  in  Section  2.4.2,  and  addresses  cumulative  impacts  on  aquatic 
resources,  including  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  in  Section  7.3.2.  The  review  team  concluded 
that  the  cumulative  impact  on  aquatic  resources  from  past  and  historic  water-quality 
degradation,  past  water-management  practices,  and  historic  fishing  pressure  would  be 
MODERA  TE  to  LARGE,  but  the  incremental  impact  from  construction  and  operation  of  the  new 
plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site  would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  this  cumulative  impact.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  in  response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-91;  Section  No.  2.4.2. 1;  Line  No.  4-6;  This  DEIS  states:  "These 
potential  changes  are  likely  to  result  in  movement  of  populations  of  more  marine  and  euryhaline 
species  farther  up  the  Delaware  River  Estuary."  This  statement  is  dependent  on  the  relative 
change  in  temperature  and  salinity.  An  appreciable  change  in  temperature  and  salinity  would 
have  to  occur  for  species  distributions  to  significantly  change.  (0015-1-17  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  Given  that  the  aquatic  habitat  in  the  vicinity  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  is  already  a  transition  zone  with  fluctuating  salinity  and  temperature,  any  increase  in 
sea-level  rise  will  contribute  to  changes  that,  although  slight,  may  provide  additional  habitat  for 
species  that  can  tolerate  incremental  shifts  of  a  few  salinity  units  or  degrees.  Section  2.4.2. 7 
was  revised  to  make  clear  that  the  changes  would  be  expected  to  be  incremental  over  time. 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-91;  Section  No.  2.4.2. 1;  Line  No.  18-20;  Suggest  changing  "  ...  and 
there  is  little  to  no  submerged  aquatic  vegetation  observed  ..."  to  "...  and  there  was  no 
submerged  aquatic  vegetation  observed  ...".  No  submerged  aquatic  vegetation  was  located 
during  the  surveys  conducted  to  support  this  application.  (0015-1-18  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  commenter  is  correct,  there  has  been  no  documentation  of  submerged  aquatic 
vegetation  near  the  PSEG  Site.  Section  2.4.2. 1  was  revised  to  reflect  this  correction.

Subsection  2. 4. 2. 2. 3,  the  knobbed  whelk  and  the  channeled  whelk  have  also  been  encountered 
in  the  Delaware  Bay.  The  whelk  species  have  been  collected  primarily  along  the  Atlantic  Coast, 
over  30  miles  downriver  of  the  PSEG  site.  Clarify  in  text.  (0015-1-20  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  knobbed  whelk  and  the  channeled  whelk  were  not  included  in  the  discussion 
of  commercial  species  in  Section  2. 4. 2. 3  because  they  were  encountered  in  Delaware  Bay 
30  mi  or  more  downriver  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Section  2. 4. 2. 3  was  revised  to  provide  clarity 
regarding  the  location  of  the  described  commercial  species.

Make  conforming  changes  through  the  DEIS.  (0015-11-15  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  Following  American  Fisheries  Society  Special  Publication  29  on  nomenclature  for 
common  fish  names,  the  common  name  is  now  capitalized  when  referring  to  a  specific  species. 
No  changes  were  made  to  the  FIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment.

significant  advantages  compared  to  the  proposed  intake  system  ..."  Should  "favorable"  in  the  1st 
sentence  be  "unfavorable"?  (0015-12-7  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  creation  of  an  intake  canal  may  provide  additional  available  aquatic  habitat 
that  may  be  favorable  to  support  aquatic  life  depending  on  length  and  depth  of  the  new  canal. 

No  changes  were  made  to  the  FIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment.

Response:  The  sentence  is  a  conclusion  based  on  the  review  team's  independent 
assessment,  which  includes  regulations  under  Clean  Water  Act  Phase  /  316(b)  as  stated  in 
previous  paragraphs  within  Section  5.3.2. 1.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of

12  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  commenter  is  correct.  Mortality  is  assumed  for  entrained  organisms  based  on 
exposure  to  extreme  heat,  physical  stress,  and  chemical  exposure.  Section  5.3.2. 1  was 
modified  to  clarify  mortality  assumptions. 

Comment:  Page  No.  5-42;  Section  No.  5. 3. 2. 3;  Line  No.  9-10;  Suggest  adding  the  following

[Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  Section  5.3.2. 3  discusses  operational  effects  only  and  does  not  include 
construction,  whereas  the  ETH  assessment  analyzes  all  aspects  of  construction  and  operation 
pursuant  to  consultation  with  NMFS  under  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Act.  EFH  consultation  with 
NMFS  was  updated  since  the  publication  of  the  draft  EIS  and  is  included  in  Section  5. 3. 2. 3  and 
in  supplemental  material  in  Appendix  F. 

Comment:  Page  No.  7-28  to  7-29;  Section  No.  7. 3. 2. 5;  This  section  implies  that  Hurricane 
Sandy  in  2012  was  attributable  to  Climate  Change.  There  is  no  evidence  for  that,  and 
discussion  of  Hurricane  Sandy  should  be  deleted.  (0015-4-9  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  discussion  of  climate  change  effects  in  Section  7. 3. 2. 5  notes  that  climate 
change  could  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  precipitation  events, 
which  could  have  impacts  on  aquatic  resources.  Hurricane  Sandy  was  cited  as  an  example  of 
an  extreme  precipitation  event  that  had  impacts  on  aquatic  environments;  the  section  does  not 
attribute  Hurricane  Sandy  to  climate  change.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of 
this  comment. 

Comment:  The  DEIS  does  an  inadequate  job  at  looking  at  the  overall  environmental  impacts 
from  dredging,  especially  to  water  quality  from  filling  in  wetlands  and  coastal  resources  or 
building  new  piers.  The  DEIS  does  not  take  an  adequate  look  at  the  impacts  to  aquatic  life  or 
fisheries.  (0016-7  [Tittel,  Jeff]) 

Response:  The  comment  is  not  specific  in  identifying  how  dredging  for  a  new  barge  facility  for 
the  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  adversely  affect  aquatic  life  or  fisheries.  The  EIS  addresses 
impacts  on  all  aquatic  resources  from  dredging  and  installation  of  the  barge  facility  for  a  new 
nuclear  plant  in  Section  4.3.2.  Impacts  to  wetlands  are  described  in  Section  4.3.1.  Additional

information  related  to  dredging  and  installation  of  the  barge  facility  has  been  added  to  Section 
4.3.2  that  further  characterizes  the  effects  of  these  activities  on  aguatic  resources. 

Comment:  Section  2.0  Affected  Environment/Section  4.0  Construction  Impacts  at  the 
Proposed  Site:  Several  minor  updates  to  the  discussion  of  species  listed  under  the  Endangered 
Species  Act  (ESA)  of  1973,  as  amended,  are  necessary.  Because  you  have  determined  that 
neither  hawksbill  nor  leatherback  sea  turtles  occur  near  Artificial  Island,  we  recommend  these 
species  be  deleted  from  Table  2-8.  You  should  also  note  that  several  Distinct  Population 
Segments  (DPS)  of  loggerhead  sea  turtles  are  listed  under  the  ESA;  only  the  threatened 
Northwest  Atlantic  DPS  occurs  in  the  action  area.  Five  DPSs  of  Atlantic  sturgeon  are  listed 
under  the  ESA;  subadults  or  adults  from  any  of  the  five  DPSs  could  occur  in  the  action  area. 

The  sections  discussing  shortnose  and  Atlantic  sturgeon  should  note  that  due  to  the  salinity 
near  Artificial  Island,  early,  life  stages  (i.e.,  eggs,  larvae  and  young  of  the  year)  are  not  expected 
to  be  present.  (0018-1-1  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  The  species  information  provided  was  reviewed  and  revisions  were  made  to 
Sections  2.4.2,  4.3.2,  and  5.3.2  relevant  to  providing  clarity  around  known  or  expected  species 
and  life  stage  occurrences  near  the  PSEG  Site.  Table  2-8  was  revised  to  list  terrestrial  species 
described  in  Section  2.4. 7  and  Table  2-  7 2  was  revised  to  list  aquatic  species  described  in 
Section  2.4.2. 

Comment:  In  [Sections  2.0  and  4.0],  it  states  that  little  to  no  submerged  aquatic  vegetation 
(SAV)  is  present  at  the  PSEG  site.  Survey  results  were  not  included  to  verify  this  assertion. 
Several  species  have  been  observed  in  the  Delaware  River,  including:  Vallisneria  americana, 
Myriophyllum  spicatum ,  Elodea  nuttallii,  Najasjlexillis,  Potamogeton  sp.  and  others  (Schuyler, 

1 988).  SAV  provides  valuable  nursery,  forage  and  refuge  habitat  for  a  variety  of  fish  including 
striped  bass  ( Marone  saxatilis),  alewife  ( Alosa  pseudoharengus),  American  shad  ( Alosa 
sapidissima),  and  blueback  herring  ( Alosa  aestivalis ).  It  is  also  an  important  food  source  for 
waterfowl.  As  water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River  continues  to  improve,  more  areas  of  SAV 
may  be  found  within  the  River.  Without  additional  site  specific  survey  data,  it  is  not  possible  to 
determine  if  SAV  exists  in  the  project  site  or  if  it  will  be  impacted  by  the  proposed  project.  (0018- 
1-4  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  Section  2.4.2  was  revised  to  state  that  no  submerged  aquatic  vegetation  was 
observed  during  sampling  surveys  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

Comment:  Also  not  adequately  addressed  [in  Section  4]  are  the  effects  of  wetland  losses  on 
fish,  especially  those  identified  in  the  EIS  as  occurring  in  the  wetland  creeks  in  and  around  the 
project  area.  These  fish  species  include  bluefish  ( Pomatomus  saltatrix ),  summer  flounder 
( Paralichthys  dentatus),  alewife,  American  shad,  Atlantic  croaker  ( Micropogonias  undulatus), 
blueback  herring,  spot  ( Leiostomus  xanthurus),  weakfish  ( Cynoscion  regalis),  white  perch 
(. Marone  americana ),  striped  bass,  bay  anchovy  ( Anchoa  mitchili),  various  killifish,  silversides, 
mummichog  and  many  other  forage  species.  (0018-1-8  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Comment:  [The  NMFS  has]  concerns  regarding  the  impacts  of  more  than  100  acres  of  wetland 
fill.  Estuarine  wetlands  provide  nursery  and  forage  habitat  for  a  variety  of  species  of  concern  to 
NMFS  including  alewife,  Atlantic  croaker,  Atlantic  menhaden,  spot,  striped  bass,  as  well  as

federally  managed  bluefish  and  summer  flounder  (Graff  and  Middleton  undated).  Important 
forage  species  such  as  mummichog  ( Fundulus  heteroclitus),  Atlantic  silverside  ( Memdia 
menidia ),  inland  silverside  ( Menidia  beryllina),  striped  killifish  ( Fundulus  majalis)  and  bay 
anchovy  also  use  these  areas.  Mummichog,  killifish,  anchovies  and  other  small  fish  and  benthic 
organisms  found  in  estuarine  wetlands  provide  a  valuable  food  source  for  many  of  the 
commercially  and  recreationally  valuable  species  mentioned  above  including  striped  bass, 
summer  flounder,  weakfish,  red  hake  ( Urophycis  chuss),  scup  ( Stenotomus  chrysops)  and 
windowpane  (Steimle  et  al.  2000).  (0018-1-13  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  Impacts  to  wetlands  from  construction  are  discussed  in  Section  4.3.1.  Section 
4.3.2  was  revised  to  reflect  wetland  fill  impacts  specific  to  effects  on  fish  populations. 

Comment:  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Management  and  Conservation  Act  (MSA):  The 
essential  fish  habitat  (EFH)  final  rule  published  in  the  Federal  Register  on  January  17,  2002 
defines  an  adverse  effect ....  Based  upon  the  information  in  the  EIS,  adverse  effects  to 
several  federally  managed  species  including  bluefish,  summer  flounder,  and  others,  and  their 
prey  will  result  from  the  construction  activities  at  the  site  including,  wetlands  fill,  bulkhead  and 
barge  facility  construction  and  the  dredging  of  the  Delaware  River.  Anadromous  fish  such  as 
alewife,  blueback  herring,  and  American  shad  use  the  Delaware  River  and  its  tributaries 
including  those  around  the  project  site  as  spawning,  nursery  and  forage  habitat.  These  fish  are 
a  food  source  for  several  federally  managed  species.  Buckel  and  Conover  (1997)  in  Fahey  et 
al.  (1999)  reports  that  diet  items  of  juvenile  bluefish  include  Alosa  species  such  as  these. 
Juvenile  Alosa  species  have  all  been  identified  as  prey  species  for  windowpane  ( Scophthalmus 
aquosus)  and  summer  flounder  in  Steimle  et  al.  (2000).  The  EFH  final  rule  states  that  the  loss 
of  prey  may  be  an  adverse  effect  on  EFH  and  managed  species  because  the  presence  of  prey 
makes  waters  and  substrate  function  as  feeding  habitat  and  the  definition  of  EFH  includes 
waters  and  substrate  necessary  to  fish  for  feeding.  Therefore,  actions  that  reduce  the 
availability  of  prey  species,  either  through  direct  harm  or  capture,  or  through  adverse  impacts  to 
the  prey  species'  habitat  may  also  be  considered  adverse  effects  on  EFH.  As  a  result,  activities 
that  adversely  affect  the  spawning  success  and  the  quality  for  the  nursery  habitat  of  these 
anadromous  fish  can  adversely  affect  the  EFH  for  juvenile  bluefish,  windowpane  and  summer 
flounder  by  reducing  the  availability  of  prey  items.  (0018-1-10  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  This  comment  addresses  the  importance  of  describing  the  effects  of  site- 
preparation  activities  on  prey  species  for  Federally  managed  fish  under  the  Magnuson-Stevens 
Act.  Section  4.3.2  describes  the  effects  of  in-water  work  and  site-preparation  activities  on  these 
important  prey  species  and  was  revised  to  provide  additional  information.  These  revisions  are 
also  relevant  to  the  Essential  Fish  Fla bi tat  Assessment  and  will  be  addressed  with  NMFS 
through  consultation  under  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Act  and  included  as  supplemental  material  in 
Appendix  F. 

Comment:  Noise  from  the  construction  activities  may  also  result  in  adverse  effects.  Our 
concerns  about  noise  effects  comes  from  an  increased  awareness  that  high-intensity  sounds 
have  the  potential  to  harm  both  terrestrial  and  aquatic  vertebrates  (Fletcher  and  Busnel  1978; 
Kryter  1984;  Richardson  et  al.  1995;  Popper  2003;  Popper  et  al.  2004).  Effects  may  include  (a) 
non-life  threatening  damage  to  body  tissues,  (b)  physiological  effects  including  changes  in

stress  hormones  or  hearing  capabilities,  or  (c)  changes  in  behavior  (Popper  et  al.  2004).  (0018- 
1-11  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  Building  impacts  including  noise  and  vibration  from  in- water  work,  are  discussed  in 
Section  4.3.2.  The  NRC  staff  reviewed  the  referenced  sources  and  Section  4.3.2  was  revised  to 
add  additional  information  regarding  frequency  thresholds  and  likelihood  of  adverse  effects  due 
to  vibration  and  noise. 

Comment:  In  order  to  minimize  the  adverse  effects  of  suspended  sediment  and  sound  on 
migrating  anadromous  fish,  [the  NMFS]  recommends  in-water  work  including  dredging  and  pile 
driving  be  avoided  from  March  1  to  June  30  during  the  upstream  migration  to  their  spawning 
grounds.  (0018-1-12  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  This  comment  recommends  a  specific  work  schedule  for  in- water  work.  Section 
4.3.2  was  revised  to  include  this  recommendation. 

Comment:  Section  305  (b)(2)  of  the  1996  amendments  to  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery 
Conservation  and  Management  Act  (MSA)  requires  all  federal  agencies  to  consult  with  NMFS 
on  any  action  authorized,  funded,  or  undertaken  by  that  agency  that  may  adversely  affect  EFH. 
Included  in  this  consultation  process  is  the  preparation  of  a  complete  and  appropriate  EFH 
assessment  to  provide  necessary  information  on  which  to  consult.  Our  EFH  regulation  at  50 
CFR  600.905  mandates  the  preparation  of  EFH  assessments  and  generally  outlines  each 
agency's  obligations  in  this  consultation  procedure.  Unfortunately,  the  provided  EFH 
assessment  is  not  sufficient  to  fully  assess  potential  impacts  to  EFH  as  required  pursuant  to  50 
CFR  600.920.  Specifically,  the  EFH  assessment  does  not  evaluate  impacts  to  juvenile  bluefish 
and  its  EFH,  or  the  effects  of  more  than  100  acres  of  wetland  losses  on  EFH,  federally  managed 
species  and  their  prey.  We  seek  to  extend  the  comment  period  pursuant  to  50  CFR 
600.920(i)(5)  so  that  you  may  provide  us  with  better  information  for  the  development  of  EFH 
Conservation  Recommendations.  Once  we  receive  the  information  outlined  above,  we  will 
initiate  consultation  and  provide  EFH  conservation  recommendations,  as  necessary.  (0018-1-16 
[Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  This  comment  addresses  the  Essential  Fish  Habitat  Assessment  and  will  be 
addressed  with  NMFS  through  consultation  under  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Act  and  included  as 
supplemental  material  in  Appendix  F. 

Comment:  [In  regard  to  the  Biological  Assessment  (BA)],  the  proposed  action  has  not  been 
clearly  defined.  It  remains  unclear  what  activities  would  be  authorized  under  the  ESP  and  which 
activities  you  consider  to  be  interrelated  and  interdependent.  For  example,  while  you  state  on 
page  1  that  the  ESP  does  not  authorize  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant, 
on  pages  29-31 ,  you  present  an  analysis  of  effects  of  cooling  water  intake  system  operations. 
The  BA  should  be  revised  to  clearly  state  the  proposed  action  and  identify  the  direct  and  indirect 
effects  as  well  as  the  effects  of  any  interrelated  or  interdependent  activities.  Further,  because 
no  decision  has  been  made  as  to  the  specific  facility  that  will  be  built,  it  is  unclear  what  scenario 
you  are  basing  your  assessment  on.  The  BA  should  identify  the  full  range  of  construction  and 
operation  options  and  clearly  identify  the  impacts  associated  with  each  option.  If  you  intend  the 
BA  to  represent  a  "worst  case"  scenario,  this  should  be  noted  in  the  BA.  The  BA  should  also  be

clear  as  to  whether  the  discussion  of  cumulative  effects  is  based  on  the  ESA  definition  of 
cumulative  effects  or  the  NEPA  definition  of  the  term.  It  would  also  be  helpful  for  the  NRC  to 
explain  any  subsequent  consultation  that  may  be  necessary  if  PSEG  applies  for  a  construction 
permit,  operations  license  or  combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license.  (0018-2-1 
[Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Comment:  The  BA  [Biological  Assessment]  provides  no  indication  of  the  likely  timing  of  any  of 
the  activities  considered.  It  is  our  understanding  that  PSEG  would  have  up  to  20  years  from  the 
time  the  ESP  is  issued  to  apply  for  a  construction  permit  and  operations  license.  This  long 
timeline  introduces  significant  uncertainty  in  predicting  effects  of  the  proposed  action  that  must 
be  addressed  in  the  BA.  The  BA  should  provide  your  best  estimate  of  the  timing  of  the  activities 
considered.  (0018-2-2  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Comment:  The  BA  indicates  that  dredging  and  pile  driving  will  be  carried  out  in  relation  to  the 
barge  slip,  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility,  the  intake  and  discharge  structures  and  the 
causeway  structures.  You  conclude  that  these  activities  will  have  no  effects  to  listed  species 
because  "turtles  and  sturgeon  would  avoid  any  noise  or  disturbances."  You  have  not  provided 
any  analysis  to  support  this  conclusion.  No  information  is  provided  on  the  type  of  dredge  to  be 
used.  Sturgeon  and  sea  turtles  can  be  killed  by  hopper  dredges;  sturgeon  are  also  vulnerable 
to  entrainment  in  cutterhead  dredges  and  capture  in  bucket/clamshell  dredges.  Additionally,  the 
turbidity  associated  with  dredging  can  affect  listed  species  and  their  prey.  Dredging  and  other 
benthic  disturbances  can  also  result  in  the  reduction  in  available  prey.  The  BA  must  be  revised 
to  describe:  the  type  of  dredge  to  be  used;  any  time  of  year  restrictions  or  other  mitigation 
measures  (e.g.,  silt  curtains)  to  be  deployed;  the  likelihood  of  interactions  between  the  dredge 
and  listed  species;  expected  characteristics  and  duration  of  the  turbidity  plume;  and,  impacts  of 
dredging  on  prey  species.  Pile  driving  can  negatively  impact  aquatic  life  by  resulting  in 
increased  underwater  noise.  No  information  is  provided  on  the  number  or  type  of  piles  to  be 
installed.  In  order  to  assess  the  effects  of  pile  driving  on  sea  turtles  and  sturgeon,  you  must 
provide  an  estimate  of  the  expected  underwater  noise  and  the  expected  duration  of  pile 
installation.  (0018-2-3  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Comment:  The  discussion  of  barge  traffic  [in  the  Biological  Assessment  (BA)]  does  not 
address  the  potential  for  project  related  vessels  to  strike  sturgeon  or  sea  turtles.  The  BA  must 
include  this  assessment.  Important  information  to  consider  includes  the  speed  of  the  vessels, 
their  size,  and  the  draft  of  the  vessels  compared  to  water  depths  in  the  areas  where  they  will  be 
operating.  (0018-2-4  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Comment:  [In  the  Biological  Assessment  (BA),]  you  state  that  the  new  plant  "would  not  be 
expected  to  impinge  listed  turtle  or  sturgeon  species."  However,  as  stated  elsewhere  in  the  BA, 
while  the  new  facility  would  employ  closed-cycle  cooling,  "details  about  the  screen  design, 
screen  wash,  and  fish  return  system  for  a  new  plant  are  not  available."  Without  any  information 
on  the  likely  size  of  any  screen  mesh  or  trash  bar  spacing,  any  conclusions  regarding  the 
likelihood  of  impingement  or  entrainment  seem  premature.  You  state  that  any  "turtle  or 
sturgeon  standings  on  the  PSEG  Site  intake  trash  bars  are  unlikely  and  would  be  limited  to 
moribund  or  compromised  individuals."  It  is  unclear  what  information  you  have  used  to 
determine  that  impingement  is  unlikely  to  occur.  Further,  as  noted  in  Biological  Opinions  we 
have  issued  to  you  for  other  nuclear  energy  facilities,  including  Salem,  interactions  at  the  trash

bars,  regardless  of  whether  the  animal  is  dead  or  dying,  constitute  "capture"  or  "collect"  in  the 
definition  of  "take."  (0018-2-5  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Comment:  [In  the  Biological  Assessment  (BA),]  the  analysis  of  effects  of  the  discharge  is 
incomplete.  It  contains  no  assessment  of  the  effects  of  increased  water  temperatures  on  sea 
turtles  or  sturgeon,  other  than  to  state  hat  foraging  behavior  will  not  be  affected  due  to  the 
buoyancy  of  the  thermal  plume.  It  is  our  understanding  that  the  entirety  of  the  thermal  plume 
will  not  be  limited  to  surface  waters.  A  more  thorough  analysis  of  effects  of  the  thermal  plume 
on  sea  turtles  and  sturgeon,  their  habitats  and  prey,  must  be  provided.  You  should  also 
consider  any  predicted  changes  in  ambient  water  temperature  in  the  action  area  due  to  climate 
change.  This  is  particularly  important  given  that  PSEG  may  not  even  apply  for  a  construction 
and  operations  license  until  20  years  after  the  ESP  is  issued.  You  state  that  turtles  and 
sturgeon  may  avoid  the  area  that  experiences  high  velocity  and  turbulence;  there  is  no  analysis 
of  the  effects  of  this  avoidance.  Further,  while  you  mention  a  chemical  discharge,  there  is  no 
indication  of  which  chemicals  may  be  discharged  and  no  analysis  of  the  effects  of  that 
discharge.  (0018-2-6  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Comment:  We  also  note  that  Section  5.3  should  be  updated  to  reflect  the  conclusions  of  our 
July  2014  Biological  Opinion  on  the  effects  of  the  continued  operation  of  the  Salem  and  Hope 
Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Stations.  (0018-2-7  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  These  comments  concern  preparation  of  the  Biological  Assessment  and  will  be 
addressed  with  NMFS  through  ESA  section  7  consultation  and  included  as  supplemental 
material  in  Appendix  F. 

Comment:  Generally,  the  only  way  to  adequately  protect  aquatic  resources  is  to  avoid 
impacting  them  in  the  first  place.  Wetlands  receive  legal  protection  because  they  have  been 
shown  to  be  a  significant  ecological  resource  that  provides  a  variety  of  functions  that  are  of 
value  to  humans,  wildlife  and  the  economy.  For  example,  wetland  declines  are  believed  by 
experts  to  be  responsible  in  part  for  the  "significant  decline  in  blue  fish  populations"  in  New 
Jersey.  Blue  fish  and  striped  bass  are  recreationally  important  and  depend  on  wetlands  that 
provide  habitat  for  their  small  prey  fish  [See  Frumhoffet  al.  2007.  Confronting  Climate  Change 
in  the  U.S.  Northeast:  Science,  Impacts,  and  Solutions.  Synthesis  report  of  the  Northeast 
Climate  Impacts  Assessment  (NECIA).  Cambridge,  MA:  Union  of  Concerned  Scientists 
(UCS).].  Constructing  upon  such  a  large  acreage  of  wetlands  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  will 
contribute  to  this  decline.  (0020-2-4  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  commenter  is  concerned  about  the  loss  of  wetlands  and  the  decline  of  Bluefish 
due  to  construction.  Section  4.3. 7  of  the  EIS  describes  the  permanent  loss  of  131  ac  of 
wetlands  habitat,  predominantly  Phragmites,  associated  with  building  activities  in  context  of  the 
ecological  function  of 25,534  acres  of  wetlands  habitats  in  the  vicinity.  Section  2.4.2  describes 
the  aquatic  communities  in  the  onsite  small  marsh  creeks  associated  with  these  wetlands  and 
compares  the  aquatic  assemblages  with  large  marsh  creeks  in  restored  and  unaffected 
wetlands  areas.  As  described  in  Section  2. 4.2,  the  small  marsh  creek  segments  and  associated 
wetlands  that  will  be  permanently  lost  as  a  result  of  installation  activities  have  limited  diversity 
and  lower  overall  biomass  compared  to  the  unaffected  marsh  creek  segments.  No  changes 
were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment.

Comment:  Studies  have  shown  that  fish  assemblages  can  be  similar  in  Phragmities  and 
Spartina  alterniflora  wetlands  or  even  present  in  greater  densities  [See  Fell  et  al.  (2006).  Short¬ 
term  effects  on  macroinvertebrates  and  fishes  of  herbiciding  and  mowing  Phragmites  australis- 
dominated  tidal  marsh.  Northeastern  Naturalist,  13(2),  191-212.;  Warren  et  al.  (2001).  Rates, 
patterns,  and  impacts  of  Phragmites  australis  expansion  and  effects  of  experimental  Phragmites 
control  on  vegetation,  macroinvertebrates,  and  fish  within  tidelands  of  the  lower  Connecticut 
River.  Estuaries,  24(1),  90-107.].  Data  collected  by  PSEG  in  and  around  Artificial  Island  in  the 
Delaware  River  ecosystem  demonstrates  that  Phragmites  dominated  wetlands  provide  both 
food  and  habitat  valuable  to  the  Delaware  Bay  system.  For  example,  according  to  an  evaluation 
of  the  restored  wetlands  from  the  previous  Salem  NJPDES  permit  [See  Delaware  Riverkeeper 
Network.  2003.  Evaluation  of  special  conditions  contained  in  Salem  Nuclear  Generating 
Station  NJPDES  permit  to  restore  wetlands,  install  fish  ladders,  and  increase  biological 
abundance  within  the  Delaware  Estuary.  Prepared  by  Carpenter  Environmental  Associates. 

Inc.  Dec  3,  2003.]:  "It  has  not  been  demonstrated  that  the  restoration  of  the  Phragmites 
dominated  sites  is  increasing  fish  utilization  of  those  areas.  .  .  .  These  results  indicate  that 
Phragmites  eradication  has  not  been  proven  to  increase  utilization  of  the  site  and  increased  fish 
production."  (0020-2-15  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  commenter  questions  the  value  of  restored  wetlands  as  advantageous  over 
Phragmites-dominated  wetlands  for  increasing  fish  habitat.  Fish  sampling  in  restored  wetlands 
areas  and  Phragmites-dominated  wetlands  areas  were  combined  in  Section  2.4.2  under 
descriptions  for  small  marsh  creeks  and  large  marsh  creeks  in  order  to  present  a  more  robust 
assessment  of  the  aquatic  community  for  the  area.  The  NRC  Staff  reviewed  the  referenced 
scientific  articles  and  determined  that  the  research  represented  in  these  documents  neither 
supports  or  diminishes  the  attributes  of  long-term  restoration  of  tidal  marshes  in  the  Delaware 
Estuary.  The  goals  of  the  EEP  extend  to  improving  wetland  habitats  for  more  than  just  fish,  as 
described  in  Section  2.4.1.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  best  available  science  was  not  used  to  evaluate  the  aquatic  impacts  from 
building  activities,  and  therefore,  the  conclusion  that  impacts  would  be  small  is  based  on 
insufficient  information.  The  DEIS  should  reevaluate  the  construction  impacts  on  aquatic 
species,  specifically  the  science  related  to  noise  impacts  and  avoidance  behavior  related  to  pile 
driving  and  increased  vessel  traffic.  The  impacts  to  aquatic  resources  are  "expected  to  be 
temporary  because  fish  and  mobile  invertebrates  likely  would  avoid  areas  of  building  activity  ..." 
(p  4-49)  and  impacts  "would  be  largely  controlled  by  the  use  of  BMPs  associated  with  the 
management  of  water  quality  [sedimentation  and  erosion]"  (p  4-50).  The  review  team 
concluded  that  impacts  to  aquatic  biota  during  construction  would  be  small  and  no  mitigation 
measure  would  be  warranted.  However,  no  scientific  research  was  analyzed  or  referenced  to 
support  the  assumptions  of  this  assessment,  and  therefore,  this  conclusion  is  based  on 
insufficient  information.  (0020-3-10  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  NRC  needs  to  evaluate  both  the  short-term  and  long-term  impacts  of 
construction  noise  and  increases  in  barge/  vessel  traffic  noise  as  a  result  of  the  proposed 
project.  (0020-3-11  [van  Rossum,  Maya])

sounds.  The  Journal  of  the  Acoustical  Society  of  America,  1 35(5),  3101-3116.;  Bailey  et  al. 
(2014).  Assessing  environmental  impacts  of  offshore  wind  farms:  lessons  learned  and 
recommendations  for  the  future.  Aquatic  biosystems,  10(1),  8.].  Offshore  energy  development 
in  recent  years  has  resulted  in  research  around  the  world  involving  the  biological  and  population 
effects  of  underwater  noise  associated  with  construction  and  pile  driving.  This  research  should 
be  evaluated  as  part  of  the  analysis  of  aquatic  impacts  of  the  proposed  project,  and  the  impacts 
should  be  mitigated.  (0020-3-12  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  A  review  of  research  and  data  related  to  construction  noise  impacts  to  aquatic  and 
marine  species  within  the  Delaware  Estuary  is  needed,  including  the  adverse  effect  on  natural 
behavior,  feeding,  or  reproductive  habits  and  the  potential  to  cause  injury  or  even  death.  Since 
the  best  available  science  indicates  a  potential  for  impact,  construction  specification  and 
guidelines  should  be  used  to  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  to,  at  a  minimum,  Atlantic  Sturgeon 
and  sea  turtles.  A  review  of  West  Coast  construction  projects  should  be  conducted  along  with 
other  major  bridge  construction  projects  in  the  Mid-Atlantic  States  which  have  developed  and 
implemented  underwater  noise  monitoring  and  mitigation  measures  [See  Thalheimer  et  al. 

2014,  Development  and  Implementation  of  an  Underwater  Construction  Noise  Program. 
Development].  Furthermore,  impact  analyses  and  mitigation  methods  have  been  utilized  in 
other  industries  for  pile-driving  activities  including  offshore  wind  farms  and  oil  exploration,  and 
the  outcomes  and  research  resulting  from  these  projects  should  be  reviewed.  (0020-3-13  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  In  addition  to  the  direct  impacts  of  construction  noise,  indirect  impacts  to  aquatic 
resources  from  increased  vessel/  barge  activity  were  also  not  evaluated.  Vessels  have  the 
potential  to  have  major  negative  population  level  effects  on  fish  due  to  increased  noise  levels 
and  propeller  strikes  [See  Becker  et  al.  (2013).  Does  boat  traffic  cause  displacement  offish  in 
estuaries?  Marine  pollution  bulletin,  75(1):  168-1 73.].  Lower-level  and  chronic  vessel  noise  can 
impact  fish  through  masking  acoustic  communication  and  triggering  endocrinological  stress 
responses  [See  Slabbekoom  et  al.  (2010).  A  noisy  spring:  the  impact  of  globally  rising 
underwater  sound  levels  on  fish.  Trends  in  Ecology  &  Evolution,  25(7),  419-427.;  Codarin  et  al.

auratus).  Journal  of  Experimental  Biology,  207(3),  427-435.].  Additionally,  both  vessel  and 
towboat  propellers  are  a  major  turbulent  force  entraining  high  volumes  of  water  with  the

Comment:  The  urbanization  of  the  Delaware  Estuary  in  the  vicinity  of  the  proposed  project 
makes  alternative  habitat  less  available  and  displacement  of  fish  more  impactful  on  the  aquatic 
populations.  An  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  increased  vessel  traffic  on  ambient  noise  and  the 
potential  for  boat  strikes  should  be  conducted.  This  information  is  necessary  in  order  for  the

NRC  to  make  an  informed  decision  regarding  the  need  for  a  new  mooring  facility  that  might 
facilitate  increased  vessel/barge  activity.  (0020-3-15  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  No  scientific  research  was  analyzed  to  support  the  assumption  that  the  impacts  to 
aquatic  resources  would  be  temporary.  The  NRC  needs  to  evaluate  both  the  short-term  and 
long-term  impacts  on  aquatic  species  of  construction  noise  and  increases  in  barge/  vessel  traffic 
noise  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  project.  There  is  an  increasing  amount  of  awareness  and 
research  on  the  effect  of  anthropogenic  sounds  in  the  aquatic  environment  and  how  these 
sounds  affect  aquatic  mammals,  diving  birds,  fishes,  amphibian,  reptiles,  and  invertebrates. 

The  construction  phase  of  a  project,  despite  being  temporary,  has  the  potential  for  the  greatest 
impact  on  aquatic  species,  and  of  the  construction  activities,  pile  driving  and  increased  vessel 
traffic  is  of  great  concern.  (0022-8  [Butch,  Kerry  Margaret]  [King,  Charlotte]  [Pryde,  Coralie]) 

Comment:  No  scientific  research  was  analyzed  to  support  the  assumption  that  the  impacts  to

impact  on  aquatic  species,  and  of  the  construction  activities,  pile  driving  and  increased  vessel 
traffic  is  of  great  concern.  (0034-9  [Carter,  David]  [DePaul,  Shelly]  [Furst,  Charles]  [Hvozdovich,  Steve] 
[McNutt,  Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [Owens,  Caroline]  [Pringle,  David]  [Roe,  Amy]  [Tittel,  Jeff]  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  commenters  are  correct  that  no  specific  information  was  presented  in  the  EIS 
with  reference  to  noise  tolerance  or  adverse  effects  from  pile-driving  activities  or  barge  vessel 
traffic.  Section  4.3.2  was  revised  to  include  this  information  as  a  part  of  the  impact 
determination. 

Comment:  The  dredging  and  construction  of  a  new  barge  mooring  facility  will  cause  immediate 
and  ongoing  damage  to  the  Delaware  River  which  was  not  fully  analyzed.  The  negative  effects 
on  water  quality  through  the  resuspension  of  toxics  from  dredging  and  through  vessel-related 
discharges  were  not  evaluated.  The  proposed  project  will  include  the  construction  of  a  new 
barge  unloading  and  mooring  facility  resulting  in  new  dredging  of  the  river,  permanent  impact  to 
tidal  waters,  and  on-going  impacts  from  the  use  of  the  barge  slip  and  barge  storage  and 
unloading  facility.  (0020-3-16  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  DEIS  indicates  that  the  Delaware  River  bottom  would  be  "lowered  4.5  ft  over  a 
92-acre  area,  requiring  dredging  665,000  yd3  of  sediment"  (p  4-22)  and"[d]redging  may  be 
required  to  maintain  use  of  the  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  barge  slip  ...  during  operation" 

(p  5-39).  The  expansion  of  the  existing  barge  slip  and  the  new  barge  storage  and  unloading 
facility  are  "to  be  in  use  to  transport  large  plant  components  to  the  site  during  building  activity" 

(p  4-46),  but  the  use  of  these  facilities  "...are  expected  to  be  infrequent  during  operation."  (p  5- 
39).  This  is  in  contrast  to  the  dredging  and  other  maintenance  needed  to  allow  access  to  the 
facility,  which  will  be  continuous.  Both  the  dredging  proposed  in  order  to  construct  the  barge

facility  and  the  increased  vessel  traffic  will  have  negative  water  quality  impacts  to  the  Delaware 
River  system  which  were  not  evaluated.  (0020-3-17  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  Dredging  can  resuspend  and  reintroduce  toxics  back  into  the  Delaware  River 
system.  Research  has  shown  that  dredging  operations  via  the  resuspension  of  large  amounts 
of  sediment,  can  release  chemical  contaminants  that  are  bound  to  the  fine-grained  estuarine/ 
marine  sediments  into  the  water  [See  Yeager  et  al.  (2010).  Impacts  of  dredging  activities  on  the 
accumulation  of  dioxins  in  surface  sediments  of  the  Houston  Ship  Channel,  Texas.  Journal  of 
Coastal  Research,  743-752.;  Boccbetti  et  al.  (2008).  Contaminant  accumulation  and  biomarker

toxicological  effects  of  remobilized  chemicals  during  dredging  and  disposal  operations  in 
harbour  areas.  Aquatic  Toxicology,  89(4),  257-266.;  Sundberg  et  al.  (2007).  Dredging 
associated  effects:  maternally  transferred  pollutants  and  DNA  adducts  in  feral  fish. 

Environmental  science  &  technology,  41  (8),  2972-2977.].  This  resuspension  can  therefore 
reintroduce  heavy  metals,  pesticides,  and  other  toxins  back  into  the  River  and  into  the  food 
chain,  resulting  in  both  negative  impacts  on  organisms  that  rely  on  good  water  quality  but  also 
putting  at  risk  drinking  water  aquifers  important  to  communities  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware. 

For  example,  contaminants  can  be  transferred  to  higher  trophic  levels  after  ingestion  by  filter 
feeders  through  biomagnification.  (0020-3-18  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  negative  impacts  associated  with  both  the  dredging  and  construction  of  a  new 
barge  mooring  facility  should  be  fully  evaluated  by  the  NRC,  and  the  permanent  impacts  of  this 
activity  weighed  against  the  need  for  this  facility  in  the  long-term.  (0020-4-3  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Effects  to  surface-water  quality  from  dredging  required  for  a  new  barge  unloading 
facility  are  assessed  in  Section  4.2.3  of  the  EIS.  Effects  to  aquatic  organisms  from 
sedimentation  and  turbidity  from  dredging  are  assessed  in  Section  4.3.2  of  the  EIS.  Effects 
from  maintenance  dredging  for  the  barge  unloading  facilities  are  described  in  Sections  5.2.3  and 
5.3.2;  maintenance  dredging  is  expected  to  be  infrequent.  Effects  from  propeller  wash  from 
barge  traffic  in  the  area  of  the  barge  unloading  facility  are  described  in  Section  4.3.2  and  were 
assessed  as  minimal.  Sections  4.2.3  and  4.3.2  describe  the  requirements  for  minimization  of 
sedimentation  and  turbidity  effects  during  dredging  as  required  under  Section  10  of  the  Rivers 
and  Harbors  Appropriation  Act  and  Section  404  of  the  CWA.  Section  4.3.2  was  revised  to 
include  additional  information  regarding  sediment  characterization  for  dredging  operations.,  the 
potential  for  resuspension  of  sediments  in  surface  waters  during  dredging  activities,  and  effects 
to  aquatic  biota  from  dredging  activities  and  increased  barge  traffic. 

Comment:  Among  the  negative  effects  that  have  not  been  adequately  considered  or 
addressed  by  the  NRC  is  the  impact  of  vessel  related  discharges  as  a  result  of  a  new  mooring 
facility  and  increased  vessel/  barge  activity.  There  would  definitely  be  increased  vessel  and 
barge  activity  during  the  construction  phase,  but  the  DEIS  does  not  specify  how  "infrequent"  the 
barge  facility  will  be  used  during  operation.  Furthermore,  why  are  permanent  impacts  being 
permitted  to  construct  an  "infrequently"  used  facility?  Despite  this,  vessel-related  operational 
discharges  have  not  been  evaluated.  Vessel-related  operational  discharges  represent  one  of 
the  largest  anthropogenic  inputs  of  pollutants  into  estuary  environments  and  pose  a  long-term 
and  substantial  threat  to  coastal  ecosystems.  Vessel  discharges  result  in  negative

environmental  impacts  by  releasing  both  traditional  pollutants  (i.e. ,  oil,  nutrients,  toxics,  sewage) 
and  by  contributing  to  the  spread  of  aquatic  invasive  species.  (0020-4-1  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  commenter  is  concerned  with  the  possibility  of  barge  discharges  to  surface 
waters  and  increased  barge  activity.  Section  4.3.2  of  the  EIS  was  revised  to  discuss  increased 
barge  traffic  and  discharges  from  barges  and  their  effects  to  aguatic  biota. 

Comment:  Furthermore,  alterations  to  sedimentation  and  wave  patterns  caused  by  vessels 
entering  and  exiting  the  mooring  area  could  also  increase  turbidity  which  can  decrease 
dissolved  oxygen,  can  mask  pheromones  used  by  migratory  fishes,  and  can  smother  immobile 
benthic  organisms.  (0020-4-2  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Sections  2.3.3  and  2.4.2  describe  the  surface  waters  near  the  PS  EG  Site  to  include 
the  barge  unloading  facility  site  area  as  turbid  and  poor  benthic  habitat  for  aguatic  life,  and 
noted  no  presence  of  protected,  commercially  or  recreationally  important  species  in  these 
sediments.  Section  5.3.2  determined  that  barge  use  in  this  area  would  not  adversely  affect 
benthic  habitats  or  communities  as  the  guality  of  the  habitat  is  poor,  and  is  not  preferred  habitat 
for  aguatic  organisms.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  evaluation  of  federally  endangered  Atlantic  Sturgeon  is  based  on  outdated 
information.  In  Section  3. 3. 3. 2  of  the  DEIS,  the  NRC  references  observations  of  Atlantic 
Sturgeon  juveniles  from  1991  and  1998  as  well  as  tagging  studies  in  2005  and  2006.  All  of 
these  documents  are  dated  and  therefore,  the  NRC  did  not  provide  due  consideration  to  current 
conditions  and/or  impacts.  Since  these  reports  were  completed,  there  have  been  a  number  of 
significant  changes  in  and  around  the  project  areas.  For  example,  the  Atlantic  Sturgeon  was 
declared  endangered  in  2012  [See  NOAA.  2012.  NOAA  lists  five  Atlantic  sturgeon  populations 
under  Endangered  Species  Act.  Retrieved  from: 

http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/stories/2012/0l/31_atlantic_sturgeon.html.].  (0020-4-4  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Comment:  The  Delaware  River  has  been  determined  to  have  a  genetically  unique  line  of 
Atlantic  Sturgeon,  [See  Grunwald  et  al.  2007.  Conservation  of  Atlantic  sturgeon  Acipenser 
oxyrinchus  oxyrinchus:  delineation  of  stock  structure  and  distinct  population  segments,  Printed

the  USA.  North  American  Journal  of  Fisheries  Management,  27(4),  1214-1229]  one  that 
reproduces  only  in  the  Delaware  River  system.  Juvenile  Atlantic  Sturgeon  from  this  line  has 
been  found  in  the  Delaware  River,  thus  supporting  its  ongoing  existence  and  survival.  This 
genetically  unique  line  is  known  to  rely  heavily  on  various  parts  of  the  estuary  for  various  critical 
stages  of  its  life  cycle,  and  in  fact  in  2014  alone,  over  a  dozen  Atlantic  Sturgeon  have  been 
found  dead,  dying  or  seriously  injured  in  PSEG's  Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station  cooling 
water  intake  structure  located  on  Artificial  Island  [Reports  can  be  found  on  the  Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission  website,  filed  by  PSEG]  -  all  of  which  is  new  and  vitally  important 
information.  (0020-4-5  [van  Rossum,  Maya])

Response:  Evaluation  of  effects  on  Atlantic  Sturgeon  is  presented  in  a  Biological  Assessment 
as  part  of  ESA  section  7  consultation  with  the  NMFS.  Updated  information  on  the  results  of 
consultation  is  presented  in  Sections  4.3.2,  5.3.2,  and  7.3.2  of  the  EIS  and  in  Appendix  F  as 
supplemental  material. 

Comment:  The  dated  and  deficient  nature  of  the  data  reviewed  in  the  DEIS  makes  it  deficient. 
Furthermore,  the  DEIS  does  not  take  into  account  the  cumulative  impact  of  PSEG's  existing 
nuclear  facilities  at  Salem  Nuclear  Generating  station  which  kills  some  number  of  both 
Shortnose  and  Atlantic  Sturgeon  due  to  impingement  despite  not  undertaking  mitigation 
measures  that  benefit  or  enhance  impacted  fish  populations.  Before  further  impacts  are 
permitted,  PSEG  should  be  required  to  comply  with  mitigation  requirements.  The  fact  that 
PSEG  has  failed  to  mitigate  past  damages  should  weigh  heavily  against  PSEG's  credibility. 
(0020-4-6  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  Evaluation  of  effects  on  both  Shortnose  and  Atlantic  Sturgeon  is  presented  in  a 
Biological  Assessment  as  part  of  ESA  section  7  consultation  with  the  NMFS.  This  evaluation 
includes  effects  from  operations  at  SGS  and  HCGS.  Updated  information  on  the  results  of 
consultation  is  presented  in  Sections  4.3.2,  5.3.2,  and  7.3.2  of  the  EIS  and  in  Appendix  F  as 
supplemental  material. 

Comment:  The  importance  of  our  state’s  aquatic  resources  cannot  be  overstated.  The 
Delaware  River  is  in  great  need  of  restoration  activity.  It  is  very  important  that  decision-making 
is  done  such  that  proposed  projects  help  improve  water  quality.  A  reevaluation  of  the  deficient 
sections  of  the  DEIS  will  illustrate  that  the  project  as  proposed  will  surely  not  accomplish  a  "no 
net  loss"  of  aquatic  resources.  (0020-5-18  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  Delaware  River  is  in  great  need  of  restoration  and  it  is  critical  that  decision¬ 
making  is  done  such  that  proposed  projects  help  improve  water  quality  and  wetland  and  aquatic 
ecosystems.  A  reevaluation  of  the  deficient  sections  of  the  draft  EIS  will  illustrate  that  the 
project  as  proposed  will  surely  not  accomplish  a  "no  net  loss"  of  aquatic  resources.  (0034-13 
[Carter,  David]  [DePaul,  Shelly]  [Furst,  Charles]  [Hvozdovich,  Steve]  [McNutt,  Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine] 
[Owens,  Caroline]  [Pringle,  David]  [Roe,  Amy]  [Tittel,  Jeff]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  concern  about  the  need  for  Delaware  River  restoration 
and  effects  on  aquatic  resources.  A  cumulative  assessment  for  aquatic  resources  within  the 
Delaware  River  basin  is  presented  in  Section  7.3.2  and  discusses  the  past  and  present  adverse 
effects  of  natural  and  anthropogenic  stressors  on  aquatic  resources.  Due  to  the  past  actions 
described,  these  effects  are  considered  noticeable  and  destabilizing  for  many  aquatic  resources 
and  the  cumulative  impact  determination  is  characterized  as  MODERA  TE  to  LARGE.  However, 
the  incremental  effects  of  site  preparation,  construction,  and  operation  of  the  new  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  are  not  described  as  a  no  net  loss,  but  would  not  be  expected  to  elevate  the 
MODERA  TE  to  LARGE  impact  already  evident.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result 
of  these  comments.

assertion  that  the  eastern  oyster  was  not "  ...observed  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  between  2003  and  2010"  is  contrary  to  the  well  documented 
descriptions  of  the  oyster  beds  in  the  New  Jersey  portions  of  Delaware  Bay  provided  by  the 
Haskin  Shellfish  Research  Laboratory  of  the  Rutgers  University  New  Jersey  Agricultural 
Experiment  Station  since  the  1990's.  According  to  those  reports,  there  are  extensive  oyster 
beds  within  the  6-milc  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  nearest  oyster  bed,  the  Hope  Creek  Bed, 
extends  from  approximately  0.56  miles  to  2.3  miles  downstream  from  Artificial  Island  and  covers 
734  acres.  Additional  oyster  beds  located  downstream  from  Artificial  Island  and  within  the  6- 
mile  vicinity  include  the  Fishing  Creek  Bed  (315  acres),  the  Liston  Range  Bed  (289  acres),  the 
Round  Island  Bed  (472  acres),  the  Upper  Arnolds  Bed  (446  acres)  and  portions  of  the  Arnolds 
Bed  (630  acres).  The  vast  majority  of  the  commercial  oyster  harvest  comes  from  the  Direct 
Market  beds  located  14-16  miles  downstream  from  Artificial  Island.  It  is  important  to  note 
however,  that  as  part  of  the  management  of  this  fishery,  the  oyster  population  of  these  Direct 
Market  beds  is  supplemented  with  large  numbers  of  oysters  transplanted  from  the  above 
described  upstream  beds  located  within  6-miles  of  Artificial  Island.  In  201 3  for  example,  21 ,050 
bushels  of  oysters/cultch  were  transplanted  from  the  beds  located  within  the  6-mile  vicinity  to 
the  Direct  Market  beds.  Based  upon  the  estimated  density  of  404  oysters  per  bushel  of 
oyster/cultch  material  during  2013,  this  equates  to  approximately  8,504,200  oysters. 

Transplants  from  the  Hope  Creek  Bed,  the  upper  portions  of  which  are  located  less  than  3,000 
feet  downstream  from  Artificial  Island,  have  been  suspended  since  2012  to  allow  for  recovery 
from  a  201 1  low  salinity  mortality  event  attributable  to  flooding  associated  with  Hurricane  Irene 
and  Tropical  Storm  Lee.  During  the  2009-201 1  period  however,  the  Haskin  Shellfish  Research 
Laboratory  reported  that  1 6,450  bushels  of  oysters/cultch,  or  the  equivalent  of  nearly  1 0  million 
oysters,  were  transplanted  to  the  downstream  Direct  Market  beds  from  the  Hope  Creek  Bed 
alone.  (0021-1-2  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  Shellfisheries  major  concern  is  that  the  EIS  states  that  there  are  no  oysters  in  the 
sampling  areas  (page  167).  If  they  are  using  river  sampling  zone  7,  the  one  closest  to  the  plant, 
there  is  a  large  oyster  population  in  the  south  end  of  that  zone.  There  is  also  large  population 
just  south  of  that  zone.  (0021-3-1  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Sections  2. 4. 2. 3  and  4. 3. 3. 2  indicated  oysters  were  not  found  near  the  site  as  a 
part  of  the  sampling  performed  as  described  in  those  references.  However,  the  commenter  is 
correct  that  oyster  beds  are  in  Delaware  Bay.  Sections  2.4.2,  4.3.2  (formerly  Section  4.3.3), 
and  5.3.2  of  the  EIS  were  revised  to  include  oyster  bed  information  and  characterize  effects 
from  building  and  operation  on  these  communities. 

Comment:  With  regard  to  the  New  Jersey  commercial  harvest  of  eastern  oysters,  according  to 
the  EIS  "  ....  the  last  reported  commercial  fishery  in  New  Jersey  reported  a  harvest  of  550,086 
lb  in  2008".  More  recent  Delaware  Bay  specific  harvest  data  are  available  from  the  above 
referenced  reports  by  the  Haskin  Shellfish  Research  Laboratory.  According  to  the  February 
2014  report,  the  total  harvest  from  the  New  Jersey  portions  of  Delaware  Bay  in  2013  was 
84,276  bushels.  This  was  an  increase  of  6,136  bushels  compared  to  the  2012  harvest,  and  the 
seventh  consecutive  year  in  which  the  harvest  equaled  or  exceeded  the  18-year  mean  of 
75,409  bushels.  The  available  data  on  the  oyster  fishery  in  the  New  Jersey  portions  of 
Delaware  Bay,  as  well  as  similar  data  for  the  State  of  Delaware  portions  of  the  bay,  need  to  be 
evaluated  in  order  to  ensure  an  accurate  assessment  of  the  potential  impacts  of  the

construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed  nuclear  power  facility  on  the  eastern  oyster.  For 
example,  construction  activities  that  result  in  increased  sediment  load  in  the  river  could 
adversely  impact  the  nearby  oyster  beds.  (0021-1-3  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Section  2.4.2  was  revised  to  include  commercial  landings  of  oysters  not  limited  to 
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (NO A  A)  reported  landings.  Sections  2. 4. 2, 
4.3.2,  and  5.3.2  of  the  EIS  were  revised  to  include  oyster  bed  information  and  characterize 
effects  from  building  and  operation  on  these  communities. 

Comment:  Even  though  the  system  proposed  is  a  closed-cycle  cooling  system  with  a  fish 
screening  system  designed  to  "increase  survival"  of  impinged  fishes,  impacts  on  aquatic 
organisms  in  the  Delaware  River  will  occur  through  the  intake  system.  The  EIS  does  not 
attempt  to  quantify  in  any  way  the  amount  of  fish  that  will  be  impinged  and  potentially  survive 
but  loosely  categorizes  the  loss  as  minimal.  More  information  is  required  on  what  the  actual 
losses  will  be  and  what  percentage  of  fishes  will  survive  the  new  and  improved  fish  screening 
system.  (0021-2-15  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Estimations  of  impingement  rates  are  described  in  Section  5.3.2  based  on  the 
likelihood  of  similar  intake  technology  for  closed-cycle  cooling  used  at  HCGS.  Mortality  from 
impingement  at  SGS,  which  uses  once-through  cooling,  is  presented  as  minimal  for  blue  crab, 
and  approximately  50  percent  for  fin  fish  species  with  the  exception  of  White  Perch  and  Atlantic 
Croaker juveniles.  Section  5.3.2  of  the  EIS  was  revised  to  include  a  discussion  of  conservative 
estimates  of  mortality  for  impinged  blue  crab  and  fin  fish  based  on  mortality  at  SGS,  which  has  a 
higher  through-screen  velocity  than  is  expected  for  the  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

Comment:  The  EIS  identifies  that  impacts  will  occur  from  the  facilities  discharge.  Possible 
outcomes  include  thermal,  chemical  and  physical  effects  on  the  substrate  and  hydrological 
changes.  The  EIS  goes  on  further  to  say  that  these  effects  were  found  to  be  minimal.  Detailed 
information  is  required  on  how  these  effects  were  deemed  to  be  minimal.  (0021-2-16  [Foster, 
Ruth]) 

Response:  Section  5.3.2  of  the  EIS  describes  the  effects  of  discharge  related  to  thermal, 
chemical,  and  physical  impacts  on  aquatic  resources.  Thermal  plume  characterization  is 
assessed  in  Section  5.2.3  and  shows  the  location  of  the  minimal  thermal  plume  contained  within 
the  larger  designated  HD  A  for  SGS,  and  discusses  in  great  detail  the  varying  tidal  and  seasonal 
conditions  that  contribute  to  the  fluctuation  and  dissipation  of  thermal  plume  from  the  new  plant. 
Section  5.2.3  also  describes  how  the  discharge  would  only  be  permitted  by  NJDEP  if  it  is 
compliant  with  chemical  concentration  levels  for  discharge  to  the  Delaware  River,  and 
concludes  the  effect  on  water  quality  would  not  be  noticeable.  In  addition,  Section  5.2.3 
describes  the  engineered  discharge  structures  that  are  expected  to  dissipate  discharge  flow 
energies  and  minimize  scouring  of  the  bottom  habitat  near  the  point  of  discharge.  Section  5.3.2 
uses  the  conclusions  from  the  hydrological  descriptions  of  thermal  discharge  effects  and 
describes  the  likely  effects  on  aquatic  resources.  Because  thermal,  chemical,  and  physical 
effects  of  the  discharge  would  be  compliant  with  thermal  and  chemical  discharge  permitting 
requirements,  they  are  expected  to  be  protective  of  aquatic  life.  Likewise,  the  engineered 
design  of  the  discharge  itself  is  expected  to  dissipate  discharge  energy,  and  would  not  have  a

noticeable  effect  on  aquatic  resources  except  at  the  exact  point  of  discharge.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  If  this  project  moves  forward,  [the  NJDEP  Bureau  of  Marine  Fisheries]  would 
suggest  they  set  aside  mitigation  funding  for  the  DEP  that  can  be  utilized  for  anadromous 
fisheries  research  in  the  area  and  for  the  remaining  fish  species  that  utilize  the  project  site  as 
essential  fish  habitat.  (0021-2-18  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  commenter  makes  a  suggestion  that  PS  EG  contribute  funds  to  be  used  for 
funding  anadromous  fish  research.  This  comment  offers  no  new  information  regarding  the  EIS, 
and  no  changes  were  made  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  [The  NJDEP  Endangered  &  Non-game  Species  Program  concerns  include:] 
Possibility  of  increased  impingements  of  marine  fish  and  turtles  due  to  increased  water  intake. 
(0021-3-5  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  commenter  expresses  concern  over  the  possibility  of  increased  impingement 
of  marine  fish  and  turtles  due  to  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site.  The  effects  on 
aquatic  resources  from  intake  operation  for  the  new  plant  are  described  in  Section  5.3.2  and  the 
cumulative  effects  on  aquatic  resources  from  intake  operation  for  the  new  plant,  HCGS,  and 
SGS  are  described  in  Section  7.3.2.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this 
comment. 

Comment:  Section  2.4.2. 1,  page  2-83,  para.  #  1:  briefly  mentions  "PSEG's  active  licensed 
desilt  basin".  This  basin  should  be  clearly  shown  on  an  appropriate  figure,  and  its  operation 
discussed  in  the  DEIS.  [Also  see  Section  4. 3. 1.1,  page  4-25-Impacts  on  Habitats,  para.  #2.] 
(0021-4-9  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Revisions  to  EIS  Sections  2.3. 7. 7,  2.4.2. 1,  and  4.2. 7. 7  were  made  to  provide  more 
clarity  regarding  this  feature  in  the  text. 

Comment:  Section  2.4.2. 1,  page  2-91,  para.  #2-Delaware  River  Estuary:  uses  data  from  1973- 
1976  to  characterize  plankton  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  --  use  of  40-plus  year  old  data  to 
describe  existing  conditions  is  not  appropriate.  (0021-4-10  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  applicant  has  not  characterized  plankton  in  the  area  of  the  proposed  plant 
since  1976.  The  inclusion  of  this  information  in  Section  2.4.2. 7  is  descriptive,  and  as  there  is  no 
comparative  information,  this  information  was  removed  from  the  EIS. 

Comment:  Section  4. 3. 3. 2,  page  4-48  -  Shortnose  Sturgeon  and  Atlantic  Sturgeon:  best 
management  practices  to  minimize  impacts  to  these  fish  will  also  include  seasonal  dredging 
"windows"  (see  Section  4. 3. 3. 3,  page  4-49).  (0021-4-19  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Section  4. 3. 2. 2  (formerly  Section  4. 3. 3. 2)  of  the  EIS  was  revised  to  include  more 
information  on  seasonal  restrictions  for  dredging  activities. 

Comment:  The  negative  effects  of  the  continuing  operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  on  the 
aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  Estuary  have  been  a  source  of  contention  between  PSEG

and  the  Delaware  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  (Division)  since  SGS  Units  1  and  2  began 
operation.  According  to  the  DEIS,  "operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  continues  to  impinge  and 
entrain  aquatic  species  and  would  contribute,  in  part,  to  the  cumulative  loss  of  these  species  in 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary."  Conversely,  the  DEIS  states  that  the  Nuclear  Regulatory 
Commission  (NRC)  staff  concluded  "entrainment,  impingement,  and  thermal  discharge  impacts 
on  aquatic  resources  from  the  operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  collectively  have  not  had  a 
noticeable  adverse  effect  on  the  balanced  indigenous  community  of  the  Delaware  Estuary." 
(Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants-Supplement 
45:  Regarding  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Units  1 
and  2  Final  Report  (NRC  201 1 -TN31 31 )).  (0023-1  -4  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  description  of  SGS  impingement  and  entrainment  in  Section  7.3.2 
characterizes  the  resulting  loss  of  aquatic  species  in  context  of  continuing  operations,  but  does 
not  quantitatively  assess  species  losses  for  SGS  operation  as  an  impact  separate  from  other 
anthropogenic  and  natural  stressors  that  contribute  to  species  loss  in  the  ROI.  The  citation  from 
licensing  renewal  of  SGS  and  HCGS  is  not  a  description  of  cumulative  effects,  and  therefore  the 
descriptions  of  effect  are  different.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  El S  as  a  result  of  this 
comment. 

Comment:  The  Division  has  provided  data  and  comments  regarding  the  impact  from  the  once- 
through  cooling  system  on  the  fish  community  of  the  Delaware  River  during  each  permit  renewal 
of  SGS  Units  1  and  2.  An  assessment  of  the  annual  impingement  and  entrainment  losses 
conducted  by  the  Division  in  2001  concluded  that  the  SGS  Units  1  and  2  killed  the  equivalent  of 
815,097  adult  weakfish  and  723,418  lbs.  of  adult  striped  bass  in  1999  (Kahn,  D.M.  2001 . 
Assessment  of  the  Impact  of  the  Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station  on  Weakfish  and  Striped 
Bass.  Delaware  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife,  Dover,  DE).  The  scale  of  mortality  as  a  result  of 
the  continued  operation  of  the  SGS  Units  1  and  2  have  contributed  to  declining  trends  in  fish 
populations,  thereby  decreasing  community  resilience.  While  the  increase  in  fish  mortality 
predicted  from  new  generating  stations  may  not  be  significant  (due  to  reduced  intake  water 
requirements),  it  is  unacceptable  if  it  is  in  addition  to  the  fish  mortality  already  caused  by  SGS 
Units  1  and  2.  The  Division  recognizes  that  the  scope  of  this  permit  only  covers  use  of  the 
current  Salem  site  as  the  location  for  the  new  generating  stations,  and  that  the  New  Jersey 
Department  of  Environmental  Protection  has  been  directed  to  issue  a  draft  discharge  permit  by 
June  2015  for  the  Salem  Nuclear  Station  by  the  New  Jersey  Superior  Court.  It  is  expected  that 
the  draft  permit  will  require  protective  technologies  which  will  reduce  aquatic  impacts  from  the 
facility.  Nonetheless,  the  final  EIS  should  better  characterize  the  magnitude  of  the  impact  of  the 
existing  units  in  the  discussion  of  cumulative  effects.  (0023-1-5  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  The  commenter  expresses  concern  over  intake  operation  mortality  offish  species 
at  SGS.  Cumulative  effects  on  fish  populations  from  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS  are 
described  in  Section  7.3.2.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Development  of  these  new  reactors  is  also  a  concern  given  the  anticipated  impacts 
to  numerous  federally  endangered  and  state-rare  species  that  are  known  to  utilize  Delaware 
River  adjacent  to  Artificial  Island.  Currently,  the  water  intake  structures  of  the  adjacent  nuclear 
power  plants  (Salem  1  and  2)  are  known  to  entrain  or  impinge  federally  endangered  Atlantic  and 
shortnose  sturgeons  (Acipenser  oxyrinchus  and  Acipenser  brevirostrum,  respectively),

additional  anadromous  species  that  are  important  to  Delaware's  commercial  and  recreational 
fishing  industries  species  (e.g.  striped  bass  Morone  saxatilis),  and  several  federally  protected 
sea  turtle  species,  including  two  Kemp's  Ridley  sea  turtles  (Lepidochelys  kempii).  Expected 
increases  in  salinity  as  a  result  of  climate  change,  sea  level  rise  and  channel  deepening 
activities  may  bring  more  sea  turtles  to  this  part  of  the  River  thereby  increasing  incidence  of  sea 
turtle  impingement  and/or  entrainment  at  these  water  intake  structures.  Given  the  existing 
conditions  at  the  Salem  Nuclear  Power  Plants,  we  expect  that  additional  water  intake  structures 
associated  with  the  new  plants  would  have  a  detrimental  additive  impact  on  the  species 
referenced  above.  (0023-1-6  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  Evaluation  of  effects  on  Shortnose  Sturgeon,  Atlantic  Sturgeon,  and  Federally 
protected  sea  turtles  is  presented  in  a  Biological  Assessment  as  part  of  ESA  section  7 
consultation  with  the  NMFS.  Updated  information  on  the  results  of  consultation  is  presented  in 
Sections  4.3.2  and  5.3.2  of  the  FIS  and  in  Appendix  F  as  supplemental  material. 

Comment:  Table  1  (below)  includes  a  list  of  rare  species  that  occur  the  vicinity  (6  mile  radius) 
of  the  project  area  within  State  of  Delaware  boundaries.  Please  note  that  we  have  not  surveyed 
all  of  the  areas  within  Delaware  and  additional  rare  species  may  occur  within  the  vicinity  of  the 
project  area.  (0023-1-7  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  Section  2.4.2  of  the  EIS  discusses  Federally  and  State- listed  (both  Delaware  and 
New  Jersey)  aquatic  species  that  may  occur  in  the  ROI,  and  provides  a  species  list  offish 
collected  over  several  years  from  a  variety  of  different  sampling  techniques  within  the  same  ROI 
as  described,  which  is  not  necessarily  a  6-mi  radius.  Species  that  are  discussed  as  important 
species  include  commercial  and  recreational  species,  Federally  and  State-listed  species,  and 
species  monitored  as  ecosystem  indicators  per  NURFG-  7  555.  Sections  4. 3. 2  and  5. 3. 2  of  the 
EIS  assess  the  impacts  from  construction  and  operation,  respectively,  on  these  species.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  FIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Today's  article  by  Jeff  Montgomery  states  that  the  current  units  (Salem  1  and  2) 
require  over  3  billion  gallons  of  cooling  water  per  day  which  has  caused  "large  aquatic  life 
losses."  Obviously,  the  addition  of  another  reactor  will  significantly  increase  these  already 
unacceptable  losses.  (0024-5  [Doyle,  Kathy]) 

Comment:  Testimony  has  been  given:  "PSEG  also  is  working  with  a  company  on  designs  for  a 
new  type  of  'small,  modular  reactor'  with  fewer  parts,  a  simpler  design,  deep  underground 
containment  and  waterless  cooling  features.  Although  recycling  water  systems  and  cooling 
towers  would  be  required  for  any  new  conventional  reactors,  a  permit  fight  is  expected  in  2015 
over  renewal  of  the  more-than  3  billion  gallon  per  day  cooling  water  intakes  for  Salem  Units  1 
and  2.  Environmental  groups  have  argued  that  any  increase  in  cooling  water  withdrawals  from 
the  Delaware  River  will  worsen  already  large  aquatic  life  losses  caused  by  existing  demands." 
(0028-1  [Prescott,  James]) 

Comment:  An  environmental  objection  exists.  The  necessity  for  large  amounts  of  cooling 
water  means  that  the  fish  intake  is  probably  appreciable.  (0033-1  [Clapp,  Leonard])

Response:  The  operation  of  the  proposed  new  intake  for  the  new  units  would  require  less  than 
4  percent  of  the  total  intake  flow  used  at  SGS.  The  effects  on  aquatic  resources  from  intake 
operation  for  the  new  plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site  are  described  in  Section  5.3.2,  and  the  cumulative 
effects  on  aquatic  resources  from  intake  operation  for  the  new  plant,  HCGS,  and  SGS  are 
described  in  Section  7.3.2.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Potential  impacts  to  waters  of  the  US,  the  Delaware  River  and  Bay,  and  to  fish 
populations  from  dredging  and  fill  could  be  significant,  as  well  as  from  possible  contamination 
and/or  leakage,  and  radioactivity.  (0032-9  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Response:  Dredging  activities  required  for  installation  of  barge  facilities  and  intake  and 
discharge  structures  are  described  in  Section  4.3.2  and  were  assessed  as  having  a  minor  and 
temporary  impact  to  aquatic  resources  in  the  area.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  the  [NJDEP]  Department's  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  must  be  contacted  to 
determine  the  impact  to  the  aquatic  biota  in  the  Delaware  River  due  to  impingement  and 
entrainment  due  to  cooling  systems  operation,  heat  stress  due  to  the  thermal  discharge  plume, 
and  chemicals  in  the  discharged  blowdown  from  the  new  nuclear  power  plant.  (0021-6-5  [Foster, 
Ruth]) 

Response:  This  EIS  is  for  an  ESP,  and  provides  the  postulated  details  of  operation  per 
information  obtained  from  PS  EG.  Final  operational  information  necessary  for  compliance  with 
Sections  316(a)  and  316(b)  of  the  CWA  and  to  apply  for  a  discharge  permit  would  be  provided 
by  PSEG  when  they  apply  for  an  operating  license  or  COL.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS 
as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

E.2.11  Comments  Concerning  Socioeconomics 

Comment:  They  employ  a  lot  of  our  residents.  This  just  doesn't  happen,  it  happens  through 
leadership.  And  from  the  top  on  down  we  thank  them  for  their  leadership  and  guidance.  This 
additional  reactor  I  know  will  impact  our  community  in  a  positive  way  through  additional  tax 
revenue,  through  income  tax,  additional  income  tax  revenue,  through  additional  real  estate 
revenue,  even  sales  tax.  It  will  impact  our  community  directly,  and  indirectly.  If  you  ride  down 
Sound  County  roads  you  will  see  a  lot  of  empty  businesses.  There  will  no  longer  be  empty 
businesses.  (0004-10-3  [Acton,  Julie]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  the  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  proposed  action, 
including  tax  revenues,  in  Sections  4.4.3  and  5.4.3  of  the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  nearly  32  square  miles  of  PSEG's  Estuary  Enhancement  Program,  and  we  all 
heard  that  this  is  probably  the  largest  privately-funded  program  in  the  world,  consists  mainly  of 
newly  enhanced  restored  and/or  preserved  wetlands,  all  of  which  contribute,  materially,  to  New 
Jersey's  three  billion  dollar  commercial  and  recreational  fisheries.  (0004-9-2  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  PSEG's  EEP  in  Section  2.4  of  the  EIS  as  part  of  the 
existing  environment.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment.

Comment:  Three  of  my  neighbors,  within  a  block  or  two  of  where  I  live,  work  on  the  island. 

They  are  happy  with  their  jobs,  good  paying  permanent  jobs.  That  we  need  more  of  in  Salem 
County.  This  new  plant  will  provide  that.  (0004-17-1  [Osborn,  Sam]) 

Comment:  Finally,  let  me  talk  about  jobs.  I  am  a  union  leader,  after  all.  A  fourth  nuclear  power 
plant,  as  proposed  by  PSEG,  could  mean  about  600  new  full-time  jobs,  good  quality  jobs, 
running  that  plant.  That  is  extremely  important  here  in  Salem  County  where  the  unemployment 
rate  remains  above  the  state  average,  and  where  neighboring  Cumberland  County,  has  the 
worst  unemployment  rate  in  New  Jersey.  Building  that  new  nuclear  plant  would  also  bring  in 
more  than  4,000  construction  jobs  to  the  site.  Statewide  there  are  20  IBEW  locals  representing 
35,000  members.  I  know  how  important  a  project  like  this  would  be  to  my  brothers  and  sisters 
in  the  construction  locals.  I  will  let  the  experts  talk  about  the  economy.  I  just  know  that  the 
direct  effect  of  thousands  of  operating  and  construction  jobs  is  vitally  important  here  in  south 
Jersey.  (0004-18-5  [Hufsey,  Moe]) 

Comment:  At  our  school  we  have  a  program  that  trains  students  in  architectural  drafting,  and 
construction,  in  electrical  and  welding.  Certainly  people  what  would  have  immediate  impact 
from  a  project  of  this  nature.  I  have  been  the  principal  of  the  high  school  for  the  past  five  years. 

I  have  been  an  employee  in  the  district  since  2001.  And  there  has  been  no  other  project  like 
this  in  Salem  County,  that  would  create  that  type  of  job  creation,  here  locally,  for  our  students. 
(0004-23-3  [Helder,  Jason]) 

Comment:  I  did  a  little  research  before  I  came  here,  today,  and  found  that  about  20  percent  of 
the  workforce,  at  that  location,  are  residents  of  the  State  of  Delaware.  If  PSEG  moves  forward 
with  the  new  construction,  we  know  that  the  construction  workforce  could  grow  to  over  4,000 
jobs,  many  of  which  will  go  to  Delawareans.  And  we  know  that  new  construction  will  bring  a 
major  and  much  needed  boost  to  our  economy.  I  think  we  have  all  experienced  that,  through 
the  last  several  years  of  the  legislature.  (0007-1-2  [Cathead,  Richard]) 

Comment:  Finally,  let  me  talk  about  jobs.  After  all  I  am  a  union  leader.  Currently  about  20 
percent  of  PSEG  Nuclear  employees  are  Delaware  residents.  A  fourth  nuclear  plant,  as 
proposed  by  PSEG,  could  mean  about  4,100  construction  jobs  to  build  the  plant.  And  an 
additional  600  new  full-time  good  quality  jobs  to  run  the  plant.  I  will  let  the  experts  talk  about  the 
economy.  I  just  know  that  the  direct  effect  of  thousands  of  operating  and  construction  jobs,  is 
vitally  impodant  here  in  Delaware,  and  the  entire  mid-Atlantic  region.  (0007-8-7  [Spiese,  Steve]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  the  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  proposed  action, 
including  potential  employment  impacts,  in  Sections  4.4  and  5.4  of  the  EIS.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  new  plant  will  also  generate  business  for  other  firms  that  supply  PSEG  with 
various  products  and  services.  These  purchases  are  expected  to  amount  to  339  million  dollars, 
within  New  Jersey,  and  1 5  million  dollars  per  year  within  the  four  county  local  economic  area. 
PSEG's  Hope  Creek  and  Salem  Nuclear  Facilities  are  already  a  primary  economic  engine  for 
their  communities.  And  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  plant  will  further  enhance  the 
company's  key  role.  (0004-2-10  [Egenton,  Michael])

job  creation,  and  economic  growth,  here  in  New  Jersey,  making  both  a  near  term  and  lasting 
contribution  to  the  local,  state,  and  regional  economy.  These  beneficial  economic  impacts  are 
especially  impressive  when  examined  in  further  detail.  First,  in  terms  of  job  creation,  the  new 
plant  is  likely  to  create  600  jobs  to  staff  the  plant's  workforce;  4,100  construction  jobs  to  build 
the  plant,  and  an  additional  586  local  and  4,000  regional  indirect  jobs  during  construction;  and 
185  local,  and  1,265  regional  indirect  jobs,  during  operation,  due  to  a  multiplier  effect.  The 
economic  value  of  these  jobs  will  also  result  in  a  projected  one  million  dollars,  per  year,  in 
additional  income  tax  revenue,  and  projected  23  million  dollar  per  year  in  sales  tax  revenue,  for 
the  State  of  New  Jersey.  (0004-2-9  [Egenton,  Michael]) 

Comment:  I'm  here  to  tell  you  why  this  project  is  important  to  the  economy  of  Delaware,  which 
is  important,  obviously  to  my  members,  my  1,800  members  of  businesses,  the  whole  business 
community  in  Delaware,  and  to  our  residents.  There  are  two  things.  We  have  recovered  from 
the  recession  about  85  percent  of  the  jobs  that  we  lost.  But  if  you  look  at  our  personal  income 
tax  collections,  it  is  obvious  that  these  jobs  are  not  paid  nearly  the  amount  of  the  jobs  that  we 
lost.  Our  construction  industry  was  devastated,  and  it  is  still  having  a  difficult  time  recovering 
from  that  recession.  This  project  will  create  somewhere  in  the  range  of  about  400  construction 
jobs  for  Delawareans.  It  will  also  create  somewhere  around  120  to  130  permanent  jobs  for 
Delawareans.  That  is  important  to  us,  as  we  try  to  recover  from  the  recession.  (0004-24-2 
[Heffron,  Rich]) 

Comment:  A  new  plant  for  the  community  means  more  jobs  and  more  opportunities,  a 
continued  source  of  clean,  safe,  and  reliable  energy.  It  also  provides  the  opportunity  to  impact 
new  generations  in  the  community  that  we  can  inspire  them  to  go  to  college,  get  careers  in  the 
nuclear  power,  and  grow  and  develop  in  this  industry,  which  I  think  is  a  great  opportunity  to 
impact,  to  have  productive  people  in  our  community.  (0007-15-3  [Torres,  Katherine]) 

Comment:  When  we  talk  about  impact,  economic  impact,  we  need  to  think  about  the  regional 
impact.  Again,  while  most  of  the  electricity,  or  all,  will  probably  be  used  in  New  Jersey,  a  lot  of 
our  employees  are  people  here  in  Delaware,  work  in  New  Jersey,  and  Pennsylvania,  and 
around  the  area.  So  we  have  to  think  of  this  as  a  regional  asset  that  we  have.  (0007-18-7 
[Kleinschmidt,  Mark]) 

Comment:  You  have  heard  a  lot,  lately,  about  on-shoring,  companies  coming  back  to  the 
United  States,  manufacturing  particularly.  One  of  the  reasons  they  are  coming  back  is  for  a 
quality  workforce,  and  affordable  and  dependable  electricity.  So  the  more  of  that  we  can  have,

the  more  jobs  will  be  here  in  our  region,  which  will  benefit  our  families  near-term  and  long-term. 
(0007-18-9  [Kleinschmidt,  Mark]) 

Comment:  A  new  nuclear  facility  would  not  only  provide  this  reliable  energy  for  the  region,  but 
high  paying  jobs,  and  fulfilling  careers.  In  addition,  PSEG  encourages  use  of  local  vendors,  for 
most  materials  and  service.  And  that  provides  another  needed  boost  for  our  local  economy 
here  in  Delaware.  (0008-2-6  [Evans,  Brenda]) 

Response:  The  comments  do  not  provide  any  new  information  for  analysis  but  describe  the 
potential  benefits  of  the  proposed  project.  The  NRC  staff  discusses  the  socioeconomic  impacts 
of  the  proposed  action,  including  potential  economic  and  employment  impacts,  in  Sections  4. 4 
and  5.4  of  the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Obviously  the  question  that  Elsenberg  Township  is  curious  about  is  the  traffic  flow 
associated  with  this.  The  Environmental  Impact  Statement  discussed  a  lot  about  the  causeway, 
stopping  at  Money  Island,  Mason  Point.  But  we  are  interested  in  what,  potentially,  that  looks 
like  from  that  point  forward,  and  how  that  impacts  our  residents.  So  our  hope  would  be  to  have 
some  dialogue  with  our  residents,  and  some  PSEG  staff,  to  discuss  that  moving  forward.  (0004- 
1-1  [Elwell,  Sean]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  the  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  proposed  action, 
including  the  traffic  impacts  of  the  proposed  causeway  to  Money  Island.  Impacts  during 
construction  are  in  Chapter  4  of  the  EIS,  impacts  during  operations  are  in  Chapter  5,  and  the 
impacts  in  conjunction  with  other  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  in  the  area  are  in 
Chapter  7.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  Water  Resources  Association  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  (WRA)  is  interested 
in  PSEG's  proposed  project,  because  PSEG's  proposed  nuclear  plant  will  be  a  major  water 
user,  located  in  the  Delaware  River  basin,  and  is  an  important  part  of  the  economy  in  New 
Jersey,  and  the  region  at  large.  (0004-16-2  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  What  does  the  potential  new  nuclear  plant  mean  for  the  community,  for  Women  in 
Nuclear  (WIN),  and  for  me?  For  me  this  means  that  I  can  be  happily  employed  until  I  choose  to 
retire.  It  is  also  beneficial  to  our  WIN  members,  who  want  to  continue,  and  further,  and  develop 
their  careers,  and  provide  for  their  families.  The  new  plant  for  the  community  means  more  jobs, 
a  source  of  clean,  and  safe,  and  reliable  energy.  However,  these  opportunities  are  not  only  for 
me,  or  our  WIN  members,  but  also  for  those  that  we  have  been  reaching  out  to,  the  younger 
generation  in  grade  school.  That  is  why  it  is  so  important  that  we  reach  them  at  a  young  age, 
encourage  them  to  go  to  college,  and  hire  them  when  they  graduate.  This  would  come  full 
circle.  Our  outreach  making  an  impact  on  our  local  community,  and  providing  opportunities  for 
the  young  generation,  like  myself.  (0004-20-4  [Timberman,  Tanya]) 

Comment:  I  believe  this  would  be  a  good  thing.  I'm  a  boilermaker,  and  if  this  facility  goes,  it 
would  be  work  for  me  for  the  next  five  years,  in  a  five  year  construction  period.  (0008-3-4  [Willis,

Response:  These  comments  state  the  general  interest  In  the  proposed  project  and 
employment  issues  in  particular.  These  comments  provide  no  new  information  and  no  changes 
were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Our  members  provide  jobs  for  over  a  million  people  in  the  Garden  State.  As  one  of 
our  founding  principles,  the  State  Chamber  of  Commerce  continues  to  work  towards 
streamlining  the  regulatory  process,  while  striving  to  maintain  the  economic  vitality  of  our 
members.  Jobs  is  foremost  and  critical  to  this  state,  and  our  organization.  (0004-2-1  [Egenton,

Comment:  We  know  that  [Mayor]  Sean  [Elweil]  has  some  concerns  about  traffic,  and  we  are 
going  to  address  that,  we  are  going  to  talk  to  him,  and  make  sure  that  he  has  a  very  clear 
understanding  of  what  the  impact  would  be  on  his  community.  (0004-8-5  [Joyce,  Tom]) 

Comment:  The  other  thing  about  renewables,  yes,  nuclear  creates  jobs.  But  renewables 
probably  create  ten  times  more  jobs  across  the  entire  spectrum.  (0006-4-19  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  And  we  [Water  Resources  Association  of  the  Delaware  River]  have  wide  ranging 
interests  in  water  resources.  We  are  here,  today,  because  public  service  proposed  project  is  a 
major  water  usage,  located  in  the  Delaware  River,  and  has  an  important  part  of  the  economy  of 
New  Jersey  and  the  region  as  a  whole.  (0007-16-2  [Palmer,  Dennis]) 

Response:  While  these  comments  take  exception  with  specific  content  of  the  EIS,  the 
exceptions  are  based  on  opinions  or  unsupported  assertions.  Conseguently,  these  comments 
provide  no  new  information  for  additional  analysis.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a

Comment:  And  we  do  recognize  our  current  operations  having  an  impact  on  the  community. 
We  have,  now,  over  1 ,800  local  employees,  including  about  40  percent  of  them  from  Salem 
County,  itself.  The  purchase  of  goods  and  services,  totaling  about  81  million  dollars  a  year, 
from  the  South  Jersey  businesses,  and  more  than  two  million  dollars  a  year  in  property  taxes. 
(0004-8-3  [Joyce,  Tom]) 

Response:  This  comment  discusses  the  economic  importance  of  the  current  operations  at  the 
site,  but  it  provides  no  new  information  for  additional  analysis.  No  changes  were  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  And  I  would  just  like  to  say,  in  conclusion,  when  it  comes  to  jobs,  there  is  no  bigger 
job  creator,  in  our  region,  than  our  healthy  Delaware  River  and  its  water  quality,  the  wetlands, 
the  aquatic  life,  the  terrestrial  life,  the  bird  life,  that  it  supports  here  in  our  region.  They  are  our 
biggest  job  creators.  And  we  must,  above  all  else,  protect  the  health  of  our  Delaware  River  and 
its  ecological  systems,  if  we  want  to  protect  ourselves,  if  we  want  to  protect  our  health,  if  we 
want  to  protect  our  future,  and  if  we  want  to  protect  our  jobs,  and  our  economy.  (0004-3-1 1  [van

Response:  The  comment  is  related  to  socioeconomic  impacts,  specifically  tourism,  recreation, 
or  historic  appeal.  Impacts  to  public  services  involving  tourism  and  recreation  are  discussed  in 
Sections  4.4  and  5.4  of  the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment.

Response:  These  comments  recommend  revisions  to  the  MODERATE  impacts  /r?the  EIS  with 
regard  to  aesthetics  and  recreation.  While  the  NRC  staff  uses  the  applicant’s  ER  as  the  starting 
point  of  its  environmental  review,  the  staff  performs  an  independent  assessment  and  is  not 
required  to  agree  with  the  findings  of  the  applicant.  In  regard  to  aesthetic  and  recreation 
impacts,  the  staff  reached  a  different  conclusion  based  on  their  own  professional  experience 
and  opinion.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  New  transmission  lines  will  lower  tax  ratables  across  every  community  that  they 
cross,  so  locating  another  power  plant  on  Artificial  Island  will  negatively  impact  every  community 
that  is  the  recipient  of  these  new  lines.  These  new  transmission  lines  will  likely  have  an  impact 
on  literally  hundreds  of  miles  of  land  in  New  Jersey.  (0020-4-18  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  assessment  of  benefits  and  costs  related  to  transmission  lines  are  outside  the 
scope  of  the  EIS.  Transmission  line  impacts  are  discussed  as  cumulative  impacts  in  Chapter  7 
of  the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment.

the  discussion  on  page  9-136  should  be  expanded  to  distinguish  between  physical  impacts  and 
aesthetic  impacts,  as  on  page  9-139.  (0015-6-11  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  comment  is  confusing  the  incremental  impacts  at  Site  7-  1  (as  described  on 
page  9- 136  of  the  draft  EIS)  with  the  cumulative  impacts  (as  described  on  page  9- 139  of  the

draft  EIS).  The  statements  in  the  EIS  are  accurate  as  written.  No  changes  were  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  10-14;  Section  No.  10.2.2;  Table  10-2;  Demography  impacts-DEIS  Table 
5.4  states  that  Salem  County,  NJ  would  experience  a  population  increase  of  0.04  percent. 

Table  10-2  states  that  Salem  County,  NJ  would  experience  a  0.39  percent  increase  in 
population.  (0015-7-9  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  entry  of  0.39  percent  in  Table  10-2  is  correct;  however,  the  entry  of  0.04 
percent  in  Table  5-4  is  in  error.  Therefore,  the  entry  for  the  population  increase  in  Salem 
County,  NJ,  in  Table  5-4  has  been  revised  in  the  EIS  to  show  0.39  percent  as  the  correct 
numerical  value. 

E.2.12  Comments  Concerning  Environmental  Justice 

Comment:  I  also  just,  in  closing,  wanted  to  bring  up  the  fact  that  they  said  there  was  no  -  you 
said  there  was  no  environmental  justice  impacts,  on  page  17  [in  the  Reader's  Guide].  Right 
across  the  river,  in  emergency  response  planning  area  D,  there  is  an  increased  cancer 
incidence,  otherwise  known  as  a  cancer  cluster.  And  I  believe  that  this  would  qualify  as  an 
environmental  justice  area,  and  I  believe  they  will  be  impacted.  (0007-12-4  [Bucic,  Sarah]) 

Comment:  There  are  some  concerns  I  have  with  the  communities,  and  I  already  saw,  on  the 
report,  that  there  are  no  expected  impacts  to  EJ  communities.  I  think  there  are  some  problems 
with  that,  particularly,  if  you  do  have  an  accident.  I  think  there  are  some  serious  impacts 
particularly  to  the  lower  end  border  communities  in  the  rural  areas  around  the  plant  in  Delaware. 
(0007-2-5  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  I'm  horrified  by  the  NRC's  assessment  of  the  impacts  on  environmental  justice 
communities.  I  would  say  that  within  the  ten  mile  zone,  that  you  used,  that  is  in  Delaware,  it  is 
almost  entirely  environmental  justice  communities,  as  identified  by  the  EPA  and  the  census 
tract,  and  the  health,  the  cancer  clusters  identified  by  the  census  tract.  I  know  that  you  are 
using  the  2000  census,  and  not  the  2010  one.  But,  certainly,  those  were  environmental  justice 
communities  in  2000,  as  well.  (0007-5-5  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  And  I  would  ask  that  the  Final  Environmental  Impact  Statement  include,  specifically, 
how  this  proposal  complies  with  President  Obama's  Executive  Order  13650,  which  is  all  about 
reducing  vulnerability,  and  increasing  chemical  safety,  and  environmental  justice.  So  I  would 
ask  that,  that  specifically  be  included  in  the  final  statement.  (0008-4-12  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  I  am  extremely,  extremely  disturbed  by  the  NRC's  finding  that  this  would  not  have 
any  environmental  justice  impact,  and  would  not  have  any  impact  on  low  income  or  minority 
communities.  I  simply  feel  that  that  is  not  the  case.  And,  additionally,  environmental  justice  is 
not  only  based  on  income  level  and/or  being  a  minority.  There  is  also,  certainly,  the  concern,  as 
somewhat  noted  in  your  presentation  of  cumulative  impacts  and  within  the  ten  mile  zone  of  this 
nuclear  power  plant,  there  are  numerous  other  extremely  polluting  facilities.  So  I  don't 
understand  how  you  could  have  possibly  taken  into  account  cumulative  impacts  of  multiple 
environmental  and  health  stressors,  and  have  found  that  this  is  not  an  environmental  justice

concern.  The  census  track  that  the  ten  mile  evacuation  zone,  in  Delaware,  of  the  plant  is  a 
census  chart  of  high  cancer,  as  noted  repeatedly  in  the  census.  (0008-4-3  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  Your  "Environmental  Justice"  impacts  statement  does  not  even  consider  the 
thousands  of  residents  of  Delaware  only  6  miles  away  directly  across  the  Delaware  River,  only 
those  "located  8  miles  north  of  the  site  in  the  City  of  Salem."  Won’t  Delawareans  be  affected  as 
well?  (0013-3  [Oppelt,  John]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-180;  Section  No.  9. 3. 4. 6;  Line  No.  8-22;  This  discussion  concludes  that 
there  is  no  potential  for  disproportionate  impacts  on  Environmental  Justice  populations,  but  it 
does  not  mention  the  fact  that  the  pipeline  corridor  and  rail  spur  corridor  both  cross  census 
block  groups  with  higher  than  average  EJ  populations,  as  discussed  in  ER  Section  9. 3. 2. 3. 8.  It 
is  not  clear  why  these  potential  impacts  are  not  discussed.  (0015-6-15  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  No  Environmental  Justice  (EJ)  communities  were  excluded  or  overlooked  in  the 
NRC  staff's  EJ  investigations.  The  process  used  by  the  NRC  staff  to  identify  all  of  the  potential 
EJ  populations  of  interest  is  discussed  in  Section  2.6. 1  of  the  EIS.  The  health  consequences  of 
normal  operations  and  accidents  are  discussed  in  Sections  5.8,  5.9,  and  5. 10.  The  NRC  staff's 
EJ  process  is  described  in  NU REG- 1555  Sections  2. 5. 4,  4. 4. 3  and  5. 8. 3.  Accident-related 
health  risks  do  not  constitute  an  environmental justice  pathway.  No  changes  were  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  But  if  you  look  at  the  whole  life  cycle  of  how  is  the  uranium  mined,  where  is  it 
coming  from?  A  lot  of  it  is  coming  from,  I  believe,  it  is  Navajo  land,  Native  American  land.  It  has 
a  lot  of  negative  effects  on  their  land,  there  is  radioactivity  in  the  soil.  There  is  radioactivity  in 
the  water.  They  have  health  effects.  That  is  an  environmental  justice  impact.  It  is  a  bigger 
picture  than  what  is  within  our  local  radius.  (0007-13-6  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Response:  Consideration  of  the  EJ  impacts  of  mining  uranium  is  outside  the  scope  of  this  EIS. 
The  EJ  impacts  of  mining  may  be  found  in  the  EIS  for  each  mining  permit.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  5-129;  Section  No.  5.13;  Table  5-33;  The  DEIS,  on  page  5-124  states: 
"Impact  category  levels  are  denoted  in  the  table  as  SMALL,  MODERATE,  or  LARGE  as  a 
measure  of  their  expected  adverse  impacts."  On  page  5-129,  the  Impact  Category  Level  for 
Environmental  Justice  is  listed  as  "None".  (0015-11-12  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  In  response  to  this  comment,  a  new  footnote  has  been  added  to  the  entries  for  the 
EJ  category  in  Table  4-21  in  Section  4. 12  [Table  4-22  in  the  final  EIS]  and  in  Table  5-33  in 
Section  5.13  to  clarify  and  explain  the  entry  "None. "

Comment:  Page  No.  2-166;  Section  No.  2.7.2;  Line  No.  22-23;  The  DEIS  states:  "The  Phase  I 
archaeological  survey  conducted  by  the  applicant  for  the  proposed  causeway  identified  six 
archaeological  sites."  An  archaeological  Phase  I  survey  was  not  conducted  for  the  entire 
causeway,  only  a  small  portion  not  located  in  the  salt  marsh.  (0015-2-3  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-103;  Section  No.  4.1 1 ;  Table  4-20;  In  Table  4-20,  Line  for  Historic 
Properties  and  Cultural  Resources  change  "Conduct  Phase  II  survey  and  consult  with  the  New 
Jersey  State  ..."  to  "Conduct  Phase  II  survey  of  upland  lands  and  consult  with  the  New  Jersey 
State  ..."  (0015-3-9  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-101;  Section  No.  9. 3. 2. 7;  Line  No.  27-31;  The  DEIS  states:  "Based  on 
the  reconnaissance-level  information  collected  for  this  EIS,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
cumulative  impacts  on  historic  and  cultural  resources  of  building  and  operating  new  nuclear 
units  at  Site  4-1  would  be  LARGE.  Building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1 
would  not  be  a  significant  contributor  to  the  impacts."  The  sentences  appear  to  conflict.  (0015-6- 
9  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  text  in  Sections  2. 7.2,  4.11  and  9. 3.2. 7  of  the  EIS  has  been  revised  in 
response  to  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  HPO  concurs  with  the  NRC's  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  an  Early  Site 
Permit  (ESP)  at  the  PSEG  Site  (EIS)  that  the  Phase  II  archaeological  survey  for  the  barge 
facility  and  water  intake  area  has  been  completed  with  a  finding  of  no  historic  properties 
affected.  The  HPO  agrees  Phase  I  archaeological  survey  for  Money  Island  access  road 
identified  archaeological  sites  28-Sa-179,  28-Sa-180,  28-Sa-182,  and  28-Sa-186.  Phase  II 
archaeological  survey  will  be  completed  during  the  Combined  Construction  and  Operating 
License  Application  (COLA)  as  needed  depending  on  the  final  APE.  The  visual  impact  of  the 
proposed  Money  Island  access  road  is  on-going.  (0021-3-9  [Foster,  Ruth])

Response:  New  Jersey  State  Historic  Preservation  Office  (New  Jersey  SHPO)  concurrence  on 
the  Phase  II  archaeological  survey  for  the  barge  facility  and  the  Phase  /  archaeological  survey 
for  the  Money  Island  access  road  is  noted  in  Section  2. 7.  The  on-going  consultation  for  the 
Money  Island  access  road  is  discussed  in  Section  7.5  and  is  part  of  the  USACE  Section  106

Comment:  The  HPO  looks  forward  to  reviewing  the  NRC's  assessment  and  analysis  by  a 
geomorphologist  that  the  soil  boring  program  for  Artificial  Island  determined  no  presence  exists 
for  prehistoric  soils  below  the  former  river  bed  encapsulated  below  Artificial  Island.  (0049-3 
[Saunders,  Daniel]) 

Response:  An  examination  of  the  potential  for  intact  prehistoric  soils  was  included  in  a  2009 
PSEG  report  (ML  1 01 660320;  MACTEC  2009-  TN4370).  Based  on  soil  cores  done  for  the  study, 
the  report  found  that  there  was  a  very  low  potential  for  intact  prehistoric  archaeological  deposits 
to  be  present  under  Artificial  Island.  The  New  Jersey  SHPO  acknowledged  receipt  of  the  report 
at  the  January  9,  2015,  site  visit  and  consultation  meeting  and  concurred  with  the  findings 
(ML  15268A481;  NRC  201 5-TN4368).  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  in  response  to  these 
commentst. 

Comment:  Based  upon  AKRF's  April  20,  2012  addendum  historic  properties  visual  impact 
assessment  report,  as  the  Deputy  State  Historic  Preservation  Officer  for  New  Jersey,  I  find  the 
following  properties  eligible  for  listing  on  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  under  Criterion 
C  for  1 8th  century  pattern-brick  architecture:  (1 )  John  Maddox  Denn  House  (112  Popular  Street, 
Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township)  (2)  Sarah  Mason  House  (349  Fort  Elfsborg  Road,  Elsinboro 
Township).  In  consequence,  this  is  a  new  SHPO  opinion  of  eligibility.  (0021-3-11  [Foster,  Ruth])

Comment:  Through  earlier  consultation,  the  HPO  agreed  that  permitting  a  new  energy  station 
through  the  ESP  process  would  not  be  have  the  potential  to  effect  historic  properties  and  that 
HPO  comment  on  visual  impacts  would  be  conducted  during  the  COLA  when  more  specific, 
detailed  construction  information  was  available.  A  review  of  the  EIS  suggests  HPO  has  failed  to 
make  this  point  clear  to  NRC  (EIS  Sections  2.7.1 , 4.6,  and  7.5).  While  more  specific  HPO 
comment  on  visual  impacts  will  be  forthcoming  through  section  106  consultation  during  the 
COLA,  the  cumulative  effects  of  introducing  two  additional  cooling  towers,  76  feet  higher  than 
the  existing,  with  vapor  columns  will  adversely  affect  the  viewshed  of  the  Abel  and  Mary 
Nicholson  House  National  Historic  Landmark.  (0021-3-12  [Foster,  Ruth])

Landmark.  (0049-1  [Saunders,  Daniel]) 

Response:  In  acknowledgement  of  the  new  New  Jersey  SHPO  opinion  for  the  PSEG  ESP 
DEIS,  the  NRC  met  with  representatives  from  the  New  Jersey  SHPO,  US  ACE,  local  interested 
parties  and  PSEG  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  in  January  2015  to  re-assess  the  potential  for 
an  adverse  effect  on  historic  properties  resulting  from  the  proposed  project.  Several  of  the 
properties  identified  in  the  revised  NJ  SHPO  opinion  were  visited.  As  a  result  of  that  meeting, 
PSEG  asked  their  contractor,  AKRF,  to  conduct  additional  studies  to  examine  which  buildings  in 
the  indirect  area  of  potential  effect  (4.9  mi  from  proposed  plant  site)  were  eligible  for  listing  on 
the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places.  The  NRC  conducted  five  publicly  noticed  meetings  and 
teleconferences  with  the  NJ  SHPO,  interested  parties  and  the  Advisory  Council  on  Historic 
Preservation  between  January  and  May  2015  to  discuss  potential  effects  and  mitigation 
strategies  for  any  effects  resulting  from  the  proposed  project.  During  the  consultation,  the  NJ 
SHPO  proposed  a  new  Alloway  Creek  Rural  Historic  District  which  contained  some  of  the 
historic  properties  being  analyzed  in  the  indirect  APE.  Between  February  and  May  a 
Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MO A)  was  drafted  to  address  any  potential  adverse  effects 
resulting  from  the  proposed  project. 

A  meeting  between  the  NRC,  PSEG,  the  NJ  SHPO,  the  AC  HP,  and  the  National  Park  Service 
was  held  in  Salem  County,  NJ  in  May  2015.  At  that  meeting,  AKRF  discussed  the  results  of 
their  research  and  recommended  that  the  property  at  116  Mason  Point  Road  should  be 
considered  eligible  for  listing  on  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  and  that  the  property 
would  be  visually  affected  by  the  introduction  of  two  additional  natural  draft  cooling  towers. 

AKRF  also  found  the  property  at  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road  to  be  historically 
significant  and  that  the  proposed  natural  draft  cooling  towers  would  also  be  visible  from  this 
property.  On  June  24,  2015,  the  NRC  acknowledged  its  finding  of  an  indirect  (i.e.  visual) 
adverse  effect  to  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  National  Historic  Landmark,  and  the 
properties  at  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road  and  1 16  Mason  Point  Road  should  natural 
draft  cooling  towers  be  chosen  as  the  cooling  system  for  a  new  plant.  The  NRC  in  consultation 
with  the  NJ  SHPO,  AC  HP  and  interested  parties  developed  a  draft  MO  A  to  resolve  the  adverse 
effect  from  the  proposed  project.  The  draft  MO  A  was  issued  for  public  comment  via  a  Federal

Register  notice  80  FR  53579  on  September  4,  2015  for  a  30  day  comment  period  and  was 
executed  on  October  14,  2015  (NRC  2015-TN4377). 

The  text  in  Sections  2. 7,  4.6,  5.6,  and  7.5  of  the  EIS  has  been  revised  to  include  a  description  of 
the  activities  undertaken  since  publication  of  the  DEIS  (August  2014)  by  the  NRC  to  identify 
historic  properties  and  any  potential  effects  to  historic  properties  from  activities  analyzed.  The 
impact  finding  for  historic  and  cultural  resources  has  been  revised  from  " SMALL "  to  'SMALL  to 
MODERA  TE"  for  the  Final  EIS.  This  range  reflects  that  no  impacts  to  historic  and  cultural 
resources  would  result  if  the  applicant  were  to  select  mechanical  draft  cooling  towers  because 
these  towers  would  not  be  visible  from  historic  properties.  Noticeable  impacts  to  historic 
resources  could  result  if  the  applicant  were  to  select  natural  draft  cooling  towers  because, 
although  the  visual  landscape  is  already  industrial,  these  towers  would  be  periodically  visible 
from  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  National  Historic  Landmark,  and  the  properties  at  349 
Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road  and  1 16  Mason  Point  Road. 

E.2.14  Comments  Concerning  Meteorology  and  Air  Quality 

Comment:  Since  the  use  of  nuclear  power  began  millions,  and  millions  of  tons  of  carbon 
dioxide  and  other  air  pollutants  have  not  entered  the  atmosphere.  (0004-13-1  [Miller,  Lynn]) 

Comment:  I  also  mentioned  that  PSEG's  new  nuclear  unit  will  provide  power  for  more  than 
three  million  homes  each  day.  And,  as  compared  to  fossil  fuel  power  plants,  there  will  be  no 
greenhouse  gas  emissions,  such  as  C02  or  methane.  There  also  will  be  no  S02  or  NOX 
emissions,  that  would  contribute  to  acid  rain,  or  nitrification  of  our  waterways.  There  also  will  be 
no  mercury  emissions  that  could  detrimentally  affect  the  aquatic  life  in  the  Delaware  River  and 
the  bay.  (0004-16-5  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  As  we  need  the  power  to  be  clean  power.  By  law  New  Jersey  must  reduce  C02 
emissions  to  1990  levels,  by  2020,  and  must  meet  a  much  tougher  target  of  80  percent 
reduction,  below  2006  levels,  by  2050.  New  Jersey  is  on  track  to  meet  the  20  target.  A  big 
reason  is  because  more  than  half  of  the  electricity  used  by  New  Jersey  customers  is  generated 
by  nuclear  plants  which  produce  no  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  They  also  produce  no  NOX,  no 
SOXs,  and  no  particulates.  As  much  as  New  Jersey,  and  PSEG  are  committed  to  renewable 
energy  and  energy  efficiency,  I  don’t  believe  that  there  is  any  way  that  we  can  meet  the  2050 
target  without  additional  nuclear  power.  Solar  and  other  sources  of  renewable  energy  are  great 
for  New  Jersey.  Members  of  Local  94  built  some  PSEG  solar  power  plants.  But  solar  is  not  a 
substitute  for  round  the  clock  baseload  power.  And  the  only  clean  source  of  that  is  nuclear. 
(0004-18-4  [Hufsey,  Moe]) 

Comment:  While  there  has  been  considerable  public  dialogue  and  debate,  about  the  use  and 
benefits  of  nuclear  power,  no  one  can  argue  that  nuclear  power  is  the  largest  source  of 
electricity  that  does  not  emit  any  air  pollution.  While  emitting  no  carbon,  or  other  pollutants, 
nuclear  generation  provides  tremendous  economic  and  job  benefits.  The  new  plant  will  offset 
the  potential  generation  of  nearly  15  million  tons  of  C02  in  a  given  year.  (0004-2-7  [Egenton,

Comment:  The  issue  of  climate  change  and  anthropogenic  carbon  dioxide  is  considered 
important  enough  that  the  review  team  devoted  two  pages  to  its  discussion,  in  Section  9.2.5.  In 
addition  to  mentioning  C02  emissions  throughout  the  DEIS.  The  Maryland  Conservation 
Council  (MCC)  believes  that  climate  change  is  among  the  most  serious  threats  to  both  modern 
civilization,  as  well  as  the  natural  world.  And  it  is  that  world,  which  is  the  MCC's  mission  to 
protect.  Table  9.5  compares  the  smaller  C02  emissions,  from  the  proposed  reactor,  with  those 
expected  from  a  selected  combination  of  alternatives,  which  includes  renewables.  They  differ 
by  about  three  orders  of  magnitude.  Meaning  that  nuclear  power  is  significantly  more  effective 
in  stabilizing  climate,  than  any  practicable  combination  of  alternatives  that  would  be  available  in 
the  foreseeable  future.  (0004-6-3  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  The  issue  of  climate  change  in  anthropogenic  carbon  dioxide  is  considered 
important  enough  that  the  review  team  devoted  two  pages  to  its  discussion,  in  section  9.2.5.,  in 
addition  to  mentioning  carbon  dioxide  emissions  throughout  the  draft  statement.  The  Maryland 
Conservation  Council  believes  that  climate  change  is  among  the  most  serious  threats,  both  to 
modern  civilization,  as  well  as  the  natural  world.  And,  as  I  said,  it  is  our  mission  to  protect  that 
world.  Table  9.5,  or  9-5  compares  the  smaller  carbon  dioxide  emissions  from  the  proposed 
reactor,  with  those  expected  from  a  selective  combination  of  alternatives,  which  includes 
renewables.  They  differ  by  about  three  orders  of  magnitude,  meaning  that  nuclear  power  is 
significantly  more  effective  in  stabilizing  climate,  than  any  practicable  combination  of 
alternatives  available  in  the  foreseeable  future.  (0007-6-4  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  To  add  to  the  environmental  benefits  of  the  proposed  plant,  nuclear  power 
produces  no  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Nuclear  plants  produce  no  Nox,  no  Sox,  and  no 
particulates.  In  fact  the  new  plant  will  offset  the  potential  generation  of  about  10  million  tons  of 
carbon  dioxide  per  year.  (0007-8-6  [Spiese,  Steve]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  support  for  nuclear  power  plants  in  general  and/or  a  new 
nuclear  plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site,  particularly  in  regard  to  the  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases 
(GHGs)  and  other  gaseous  and  particulate  pollutants  from  such  facilities.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  text  in  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  A  third  option  was  a  re-examination  of  nuclear  power  generation.  A  technology  not 
considered  a  part  of  the  package  while  we  taught  the  course.  But,  evidently,  back  on  the  table, 
as  evidenced  by  the  current  PSEG  exercise.  We  recognize  the  value  of  generating  usable 
energy  without  increasing  greenhouse  gases.  (0004-4-2  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  The  scientific  finding  that  bears  most  critically  on  climate  policy,  is  the  recent 
understanding  that  emission  of  carbon  dioxide,  to  the  atmosphere  is,  essentially,  an  irreversible 
process,  when  compared  to  relevant  human  time  scales  of  decades  or  centuries.  The 
Academies  estimate  that  a  slug  of  carbon  dioxide,  emitted  today,  will  be  reduced  by  half,  or  only 
half,  in  a  thousand  years.  And  that  one  fourth  will  still  be  present  in  10,000  years.  And  that 
100,000  years  would  be  required  to  remove  it  all.  (0004-6-5  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  So  three  critical  questions,  conclusions,  can  be  drawn  from  this  understanding. 

The  first  is  that  we  must  reach  zero  carbon  dioxide  emissions  as  soon  as  possible.  Because 
what  is  emitted  this  year  is  going  to  be  with  us  for  a  good  millenium,  or  more.  We  don’t  have

time  to  wait  for  ancillary  technologies,  like  energy  storage  and  a  number  of  other  things  to  be 
developed.  Nuclear  power  can  do  that  right  now.  Second,  at  the  current  state  of  technology 
wind  and  solar  installations  require  backup  by  a  fast  responding  power  source.  And  the  only 
available,  today,  is  carbon  dioxide  emitting  natural  gas  turbines.  And  that  conflicts  with  the  first 
conclusion,  that  we  have  to  end  C02  emissions  as  quickly  as  possible.  (0004-6-7  [Meadow, 
Norman]) 

Comment:  The  following  quotes  are  from  a  number  of  books  that  Norman  mentioned,  on 
climate  change,  published  by  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences.  Written  citations  have  already 
been  handed  in  to  the  NRC.  (1)  Emissions  reduction,  larger  than  80  percent,  are  required  to 
approximately  stabilize  carbon  dioxide  concentration  for  a  century,  or  so,  at  any  chosen  target 
level.  (2)  Even  greater  reductions,  in  emissions,  would  be  required  to  maintain  stabilized 
concentrations  in  the  longer  term.  (3)  The  warming  induced  by  added  carbon  dioxide  is 
expected  to  be  nearly  irreversible  for,  at  least,  a  thousand  years.  (4)  Longer  term  stabilization 
requires  nearly  one  hundred  percent  reduction.  (5)  Even  if  C02  emissions  become  close  to 
zero,  the  decrease  in  atmospheric  concentration  may,  however,  occur  very  slowly  over 
centuries.  (0004-7-1  [Meadow,  Karen]) 

Comment:  Many  of  our  programs  focus  on,  or  incorporate,  global  climate  change,  and  the 
ocean  acidification  into  education  efforts.  We  believe  it  is  imperative  that  people  understand  the 
concepts  associated  with  increasing  carbon  dioxide  levels,  associated  with  industrial  activities, 
and  the  need  to  develop  alternative  means  of  producing  electrical  power.  (0006-8-5  [Duvau, 
Bryan]) 

Comment:  Also,  the  new  unit,  nuclear  unit,  will  provide  power  with  more  than  three  million 
homes.  But  without,  compared  to  fossil  fuel,  no  greenhouse  gases,  no  SOXs,  no  NOX,  no  C02, 
and  other  items  that  contribute  to  acid  rain,  no  mercury  emissions  or  particulates.  (0007-16-4

Comment:  The  scientific  finding  that  bears  most  critically  on  climate  policy,  is  the  recent 
understanding  that  emission  of  carbon  dioxide,  to  the  atmosphere,  is  essentially  an  irreversible 
process,  when  compared  to  relevant  human  time  scales  of  decades  or  centuries.  The  National 
Academies  estimate  that  slug  of  carbon  dioxide  emitted  today  will  be  reduced  by  only  half  in 
1,000  years.  That  a  fourth  will  still  be  present  in  10,000  years,  and  that  100,000  years  would  be 
required  to  remove  it  all.  And  this  is  shown  in  a  written  document  that  I  have  handed  in.  (0007- 
6-6  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  The  new  plant  is  proposed  to  have  supporting  equipment,  such  as  cooling  towers, 
auxiliary  boilers,  and  emergency  generators  that  emit  air  pollutants.  These  equipment  items  are 
subject  to  Federal  and  State  air  pollution  control  regulations.  PSEG  Nuclear  would  be  required 
to  submit  an  operating  permit  modification  application  to  incorporate  these  equipment  items  and 
the  associated  emissions  in  the  existing  Title  V  operating  permit  for  Salem  and  Hope  Creek 
Generating  Stations.  (0021-5-12  [Foster,  Ruth])

Comment:  [W]e  conclude  that  the  review  team  has  done  an  excellent  job  in  producing  the 
DEIS,  but  we  think  that  its  conclusions  to  approve  the  Early  Site  Permit,  for  the  reactor,  can  and 
should  be  strengthened  regarding  concern  about  climate  change.  (0004-6-2  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  The  consumption  of  all  these  nonrenewables  has  set  this  planet  on  a  course  of 
global  warming,  and  climate  change.  And  the  EIS,  by  the  NRC,  fails  to  acknowledge,  let  alone 
mention,  its  importance.  (0006-4-4  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  We  think  that  the  conclusion  of  the  staff,  to  approve  the  Early  Site  Permit,  for  the 
reactor,  can  and  should  be  strengthened  regarding  the  concern  about  climate  change.  (0007-6-3 
[Meadow,  Norman]) 

Response:  As  described  in  Council  on  Environmental  Quality  (CEQ)  guidance,  GHG 
emissions  from  a  proposed  project  can  be  used  as  a  proxy  to  describe  climate  change  impacts. 
The  GHG  emissions  from  the  proposed  reactor  are  described  in  EIS  Sections  4. 7,  5. 7,  and  7.6 
along  with  Appendix  K,  which  considers  the  lifecycle  of  nuclear  power  generation.  GHG 
emissions  from  the  power  generation  associated  with  the  project  are  estimated  to  be  negligible 
when  compared  with  state  or  national  GHG  emission  totals,  and  are  far  less  than  those 
produced  by  alternative  energy  sources  that  could  provide  baseload  power,  as  shown  in 
Table  9-5.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Climate  and  energy  policy  have  been  discussed,  in  great  detail,  by  the  U.S. 

National  Academy  of  Sciences,  and  National  Academy  of  Engineering,  in  a  series  of  about  100 
book-length  reports,  published  over  the  past  30  years.  The  Academy  is  one  of  the  most 
respected  scientific  organizations  in  the  world,  and  has  been  the  official  advisor  to  the  U.S. 
government  on  technical  matters,  since  its  establishment,  by  the  Lincoln  Administration,  during 
the  civil  War.  It  is  puzzling  that  neither  the  news  media,  nor  the  nuclear  industry,  have  given  the 
conclusions  reached,  by  this  prestigious  organization,  the  attention  that  they  merit.  (0004-6-4

Comment:  We  respectfully  request  that  the  major  findings  of  the  National  Academies  [in  regard 
to  climate  change  and  carbon  dioxide  emissions]  be  mentioned  in  the  final  DEIS,  or  the  final

Response:  The  staff  based  its  assessment  of  climate  change  impacts  on  the  2014  GCRP 
report,  Climate  Change  Impacts  in  the  United  States,  because  the  GCRP  is  a  Federal  agency 
with  a  mandate  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  climate  change.  The  GCRP  report  synthesizes  the 
work  of  the  Federal  government  on  climate  change.  The  GCRP  reports  and  peer-reviewed 
assessments  from  GCRP  were  suggested  as  sources  of  the  best  scientific  information  available 
on  the  reasonably  foreseeable  climate  change  impacts  in  the  2010  CEQ  Draft  NEPA  Guidance 
on  Consideration  of  the  Effects  of  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  and  Climate  Change.  The  work 
of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences  (NAS)  is  important,  and  as  such,  NAS  reports  and 
proceedings  are  used  as  references  in  the  GCRP  report,  and  the  introductory  letter  to  the  2014 
GCRP  report  says  that  the  report  was  reviewed  by  a  special  panel  of  the  National  Research 
Council  of  the  NAS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  one  thing  that  I  haven't  seen  is  anyone  come  up  with  a  suggestion  of  how  we 
prevent  carbon  monoxide  pollution  on  our  atmosphere,  and  the  damage  that  we  are  causing  to 
our  environment,  on  a  daily  basis,  and  the  legacy  that  we  are  giving  to  our  children,  and  acting 
like  we  can  stick  our  heads  in  the  sand,  and  let  that  go  on.  You  are  a  fool  if  you  believe  that  is 
going  to  occur.  (0008-10-3  [Deschere,  Mark]) 

Response:  The  incomplete  combustion  of  fossil  fuel  (e.g.,  oil,  gasoline,  or  natural  gas)  results 
in  the  emissions  of  carbon  monoxide  (CO).  CO  exists  everywhere  but  is  typically  higher  along 
busy  highways/roadways  or  enclosed  spaces  such  as  parking  garages  or  homes.  CO 
emissions  associated  with  construction  and  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  are  small  and 
thus  CO  levels  are  typically  well  below  the  National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards  (NAAQS)  at 
the  property  boundary.  Outdoor  CO  pollution  is  not  an  issue  in  the  United  States  because  there 
are  no  nonattainment  areas  (any  area  that  does  not  meet  the  NAAQS)  per  EPA 's  Green  Book 
on  Nonattainment  Areas  (http://www.epa.gov/airquality/greenbook/cindex.html).  Carbon  dioxide 
and  other  GHG  emissions  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  project  are  discussed  in  EIS  Sections  4. 7, 
5. 7,  and  7. 6  along  with  Appendix  K,  which  considers  the  lifecycle  GHG  emissions  from  nuclear 
power  generation.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  2-177;  Section  No.  2.9.2;  Line  No.  22;  Suggest  adding  the  following 
sentence  at  the  end  of  the  paragraph:  "Impacts  from  GHG  emissions  from  plant  operations  are 
not  expected  to  be  noticeable  (Section  5.7)."  (0015-2-4  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  Section  2. 9.2  discusses  the  Affected  Environment  for  the  proposed  project.  As  this 
chapter  provides  information  on  the  area  that  could  be  affected,  conclusions  are  not  drawn  in 
Chapter  2.  Operational  impacts  and  conclusions  are  discussed  in  Chapter  5.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  4-83;  Section  No.  4.7.1;  Line  No.  15-16;  The  DEIS  states:  "No  vegetation 
would  be  disposed  of  by  burning."  What  is  the  basis  for  this  statement?  ESPA  ER  Chapter  4 
does  not  make  this  commitment.  Recommend  deleting  statement.  (0015-3-6  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  As  stated  in  Section  4. 2. 1.1. 2  of  the  ER,  construction  debris  will  be  recycled, 
reused,  or  transported  off- site  to  a  permitted  disposal  facility.  The  ER  does  not  mention  open 
burning  of  vegetation,  as  the  comment  notes.  Control  and  prohibition  of  open  burning  is 
described  in  New  Jersey  Administrative  Code,  Title  7,  Chapter  27,  Subchapter  2  (available  at 


NUREG-2168

http://www.nj.gov/dep/aqm/Sub2.pdf).  Per  this  rule,  "No  person  shall  cause,  suffer,  allow  or 
permit  the  disposal  of  rubbish,  garbage,  trade  waste,  buildings  or  structures  by  open  burning, " 
and  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  may  issue  a  permit  for  the  open 
burning.  Section  4. 7. 7  of  the  EIS  has  been  modified  to  delete  the  sentence. 

Comment:  Page  No.  7-37  to  7-39;  Section  No.  7.6.2;  As  discussed  in  Section  8.5  of  the  DEIS, 
the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  plant  on  the  PSEG  ESP  site  would  reduce  emissions 
from  fossil  fueled  plants  that  would  otherwise  be  needed  to  supply  the  demand  for  power. 
Section  7.6.2  should  give  credit  for  such  a  reduction.  (0015-4-10  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  staff  agrees  with  the  commenter's  note.  Section  7.6.3  has  been  revised  to 
reflect  the  changes  in  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  K-2;  Table  K-2;  The  "Commuting  Days  (days  per  year)"  for  the 
Preconstruction/Construction  Workforce,  Operational  Workforce,  and  SAFSTOR  Workforce 
categories  appear  to  overestimated.  None  of  these  workforces  will  be  working  365  days  per 
year.  (0015-7-18  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  Detailed  assumptions  and  rationales  for  Table  K-2  are  presented  in  Chapman  et  al. 
(2012-  TN2644).  They  noted  that,  although  an  individual  employee  is  assumed  to  work  250 
days  per  year,  preconstruction/construction,  operations,  and  SAFSTOR  phases  at  a  nuclear 
facility  usually  occur  7  days  a  week.  The  average  workforce  estimates  for  each  phase  thus 
must  be  scaled  by  a  factor  of  250/365  to  determine  the  average  daily  onsite  workforce,  and  then 
divided  by  the  assumed  carpooling  value  to  obtain  the  estimated  daily  number  of  commuting 
round  trips.  In  other  words,  commuting  trips  for  preconstruction/construction,  operations,  and 
SAFSTOR  workforces  in  Table  K-2  were  presented  in  terms  of  365-day  basis.  Chapman  et  al. 
(2012-TN2644)  noted  further  that  decommissioning  work  is  more  likely  to  be  conducted  during  a 
5-day/40-hour  workweek.  Thus,  use  of  a  250  work-days  per  year  conversion  factor  during 
decommissioning  is  logical.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  EPA  also  reminds  the  NRC  that  this  project  is  within  the  Philadelphia-Wilmington- 
Atlantic  City,  PA-NJ-MD-DE  non-attainment  area  for  the  ozone  National  Ambient  Air  Quality 
Standard.  Any  Federal  action  within  a  non-attainment  area  must  undergo  a  general  conformity 
applicability  analysis  (see  40  CFR  93.153)  to  ensure  that  the  action  will  not  (1)  cause  or 
contribute  to  any  new  violation  of  any  air  quality  standard,  (2)  increase  the  frequency  or  severity 
of  any  existing  violation  of  any  air  quality  standard,  or  (3)  delay  timely  attainment  of  any 
standard  or  any  required  interim  emission  reductions  or  other  milestones  in  any  area.  While  the 
NRC  will  not  authorize  any  construction  under  the  ESP,  please  note  that  a  General  Conformity 
Applicability  Analysis  will  need  to  be  performed  when  the  combined  license  to  construct  a  new 
reactor  is  evaluated  by  the  Commission  staff.  (0017-3  [Mitchell,  Judy-Ann]) 

Comment:  This  comment  concerns  the  General  Conformity  provisions  of  the  U.S.  Clean  Air 
Act  along  with  its  implementing  USEPA  regulations.  Section93.1 50  (a)  (Prohibition)  of  the 
Federal  General  Conformity  regulation  states,  "No  department,  agency  or  instrumentality  of  the 
Federal  Government  shall  engage  in,  support  in  any  way  or  provide  financial  assistance  for, 
license  or  permit,  or  approve  any  activity  which  does  not  conform  to  an  applicable 
implementation  plan."  The  Federal  General  Conformity  regulation  requires  that  the  direct  and

indirect  emissions  resulting  from  project  activities  that  require  a  permit,  license,  approval  etc.  by 
a  Federal  agency,  must  be  assessed  through  an  Applicability  Analysis  to  determine  if  a 
Conformity  Determination  is  necessary.  Section  93.153  (b)  (Applicability)  of  the  Federal 
General  Conformity  regulation  states,  "a  conformity  determination  is  required  for  each  criteria 
pollutant  or  precursor  where  the  total  of  direct  and  indirect  emissions  of  the  criteria  pollutant  or 
precursor  in  a  nonattainment  or  maintenance  area  caused  by  a  Federal  action  would  equal  or 
exceed  any  of  the  rates  in  paragraphs  (b)  (I)  or  (2)  of  this  section."  The  Draft  Environmental 
Impact  Statement  (EIS)  for  an  Early  Site  Permit  (ESP)  at  the  PSEG  Site  indicates  that  the 
Federal  agencies  that  have  jurisdiction  for  this  project  are  the  NRC,  US  Army  Corps  of 
Engineers  (USACE)  and  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  (USCG)  (Page  4-12  and  Page  H-2).  A  General 
Conformity  Applicability  Analysis  for  ozone  (Volatile  Organic  Compounds  (VOCs)  and  Oxides  of 
Nitrogen  (NOx))  is  needed  for  this  project,  and,  if  necessary,  a  Conformity  Determination  may 
also  be  subsequently  needed  for  this  project.  When  preparing  the  analysis,  the  direct  and 
indirect  air  emissions  associated  with  project  activities  covered  by  the  Federal  permits,  license, 
approvals  etc.,  from  the  NRC,  USACE  and  the  USCG  project  activities  must  be  included  in  the 
analyses.  (0021-5-6  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  Section  93.150  (b)  (Prohibition)of  the  regulation  requires  that  an  action  must 
conform  to  a  State  Implementation  Plan  (SIP)  before  the  action  is  taken.  New  Jersey  is  in 
nonattainment  of  the  8-hour  ozone  National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standard  (NAAQS),  therefore, 
the  project  must  conform  to  the  SIP  prior  to  any  preliminary  activities/preconstruction  activities 
are  undertaken.  (0021-5-7  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  review  team  agrees  that  a  General  Conformity  Applicability  Analysis  and 
possibly  a  General  Conformity  Determination  will  need  to  be  performed  pursuant  to  regulations 
implementing  Section  1  76(c)  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  when  a  license  application  for  a  new  nuclear 
reactor (s)  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  submitted  to  the  NRC  and  prior  to  NRC  authorizing  any  action.  It 
is  expected  that  the  activities  permitted  by  any  Department  of  the  Army  permit  would  not  occur 
simultaneously,  but  rather  would  occur  over  a  much  longer  period  of  time.  Many  activities 
authorized  by  the  USACE  include  varying  seasonal  restrictions  which  result  in  more  lengthy 
overall  construction  periods.  Based  upon  the  overall  length  of  time  to  complete  the  activities 
regulated  by  the  USACE,  it  is  expected  that  the  activities  authorized  by  any  Department  of  the 
Army  permit  would  not  exceed  de  minimus  levels  of  direct  emissions  of  criteria  pollutants  or 
their  precursors  and  would  be  exempt  by  40  CER  93. 153.  Any  later  indirect  emissions  would 
not  generally  be  with  the  USACE  continuing  program  authority  and  cannot  be  practicably 
controlled  by  the  USACE.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments.

Response:  The  staff  agrees  with  the  commenter's  note.  Sections  4. 7. 7  and  4.10.3  were 
revised  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  4.7.1  Construction  and  Preconstruction  Activities,  Page  4-83,  3rd 
Paragraph,  Lines  27-31:  [Tjhis  statement  indicates  that  an  ESP  with  no  Limited  Work 
Authorization  for  the  PSEG  Site  will  not  directly  or  indirectly  cause  any  emissions.  However, 
[text  in  Section  1.1.2]  states  that"  ...  the  holder  of  an  ESP  without  an  LWA  may  only  perform 
preliminary  activities  not  requiring  NRC  authorization,  as  enumerated  in  10  CFR  50.10(a)(2). 
These  preliminary  activities  can  include  clearing  and  grading,  excavating,  erection  of  support 
buildings  and  transmission  lines,  and  other  associated  activities."  These  activities  will  produce 
air  emissions.  Please  explain  the  discrepancy  in  the  two  statements.  (0021-5-10  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Section  4. 7. 7  has  been  modified  to  clarify  that  there  are  no  direct  or  indirect 
emissions  according  to  the  definitions  in  40  CFR  93. 152.  The  preliminary  activities  listed  in 
10  CFR  50. 10(a)(2)  do  not  fall  under  NRC  regulatory  authority,  and  therefore  do  not  fit  into  the 
definitions  of  direct  and  indirect  emissions  outlined  in  40  CFR  93. 152.  Section  4. 7. 7  has  been 
revised  to  provide  this  clarification  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  5.7.1 .1  Criteria  Pollutants.  The  Draft  EIS  for  the  ESP  states,  "Table  5-13 
presents  PSEG’s  estimated  annual  non-radiological  emissions  associated  with  operating  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  estimated  annual  NOx  emissions  in  Table  5-13  are 
52.5  tpy,  well  below  the  100  tpy  de  minimis  rate...  The  estimated  annual  VOC  emissions  are 
202  tpy,  significantly  larger  than  the  40  CFR  93.1 53(b)  (1 )  de  minimis  rate  (40  CFR  93,  Subpart 
B,  40  CFR  93-TN2495)  ...  If,  at  the  combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (COL) 
stage,  the  estimated  VOC  emission  rate  remains  above  the  de  minimis  rate,  NRC  staff  will  need 
to  demonstrate  conformity  with  the  applicable  state  implementation  plan  (SIP)  according  to  40 
CFR  93.150  to  comply  with  the  General  Conformity  Rule  (40  CFR  93,  Subpart  B,  40  CFR  93- 
TN2495).  Because  the  ESP  does  not  authorize  the  activities  that  would  lead  to  these 
emissions,  the  General  Conformity  Rule  is  not  addressed  at  this  time."  Comment:  Modifications 
to  the  SGS  and  HCGS  Title  V  Operating  permit  will  be  required  for  a  new  nuclear  plant,  the  air 
emissions  associated  with  the  operation  of  a  nuclear  plant  are  exempt  from  the  Federal  General 
Conformity  regulation.  Section  93.153(d)(1)  of  the  Federal  General  Conformity  regulation  states 
that  a  conformity  determination  is  not  required  for  "the  portion  of  an  action  that  includes  major  or 
minor  new  or  modified  stationary  sources  that  require  a  permit  under  the  new  source  review 
(NSR)  program  (Section  1 1 0(a)  (2)  (c)  and  Section  1 73  of  the  Act)  or  the  prevention  of 
significant  deterioration  program  (title  I,  part  C  of  the  Act)."  (0021-5-11  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  The  staff  agrees  with  the  commenter's  note.  Section  5. 7. 1  was  revised  to  clarify 
that  emissions  covered  by  the  New  Source  Review  (NSR)  or  Prevention  of  Significant 
Deterioration  (PSD)  are  not  part  of  the  General  Conformity  Determination. 

Comment:  Why  do  I  say  this?  All  of  us  are  destroying  this  planet  by  our  fixation  with 
consuming  non-renewable  resources,  and  nuclear  energy  is  also  a  non-renewable  resource.  In 
fact,  nuclear  energy  is  a  carbon  intensive  technology.  And  only  when  it  is  operating,  is  it  less 
so.  Only  when  it  is  operating,  and  generating  the  electricity,  that  is.  (0006-4-3  [Brook,  David])

NUREG-21 68 


Appendix  E 


Comment:  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  nuclear  power  is  not  carbon-free,  it  is  on  the  contrary 
rather  carbon  intensive  when  you  include  the  cost  to  mine,  refine,  safely  transport  uranium  fuel, 
the  energy  involved  in  constructing  a  nuclear  power  plant,  the  safe  storage  of  high  level 
radioactive  waste  for  thousands  of  years,  and  the  energy  involved  in  dismantling  and 
decommissioning  the  plant.  Also,  the  energy  cost  and  carbon  utilized  to  refine  uranium  is 
increasing  as  the  available  uranium  ore  concentrations  continue  to  decrease.  The  only  time  that 
nuclear  is  low-carbon  is  when  it  is  operating.  The  DEIS  is  deceptive,  particularly  Table  9-5, 
since  it  only  includes  carbon  emission  during  plant  operations.  The  NRC  should  calculate 
carbon  emissions  over  the  life  cycle  of  all  power  plants,  from  cradle  to  grave  as  doing  so  would 
result  in  a  dramatic  change  in  these  numbers.  (0020-4-15  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  These  comments  refer  to  the  GHG  footprint  of  a  nuclear  power  plant.  Total  GHG 
emissions  over  the  lifecycle  of  a  nuclear  power  plant,  which  includes 

preconstruction/construction,  operations,  decommissioning,  and  SAFSTOR  along  with  uranium 
fuel  cycle,  are  presented  in  Tables  7-3  and  K-3.  In  general,  emissions  from  the  uranium  fuel 
cycle  account  for  most  of  the  total  lifecycle  emissions  associated  with  a  nuclear  power  plant  and 
emissions  from  operations  would  contribute  minimally  to  total  lifecycle  emissions.  Appendix  K 
and  Section  6.1.3  also  discusses  the  conservatisms  in  the  uranium  fuel -cycle  emissions 
estimate,  namely  that  the  estimate  is  based  on  gaseous  diffusion  enrichment  technology,  which 
is  being  replaced  with  gas  centrifuge  or  laser  separation  technologies  that  use  less  electricity 
and  emit  less  GHGs.  In  Appendix  K,  the  review  team's  lifecycle  estimate  of  approximately 
10,500,000  MT  C02e  for  the  reference  1 ,000-MW(e)  nuclear  plant  is  equal  to  about  37.5  g 
C02e/kWh,  which  falls  between  the  50th  and  75th  percentile  values  of  the  Intergovernmental 
Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  estimates  (IPCC  201 2-TN2648).  In  addition,  the  IPCC  report 
includes  lifecycle  estimates  for  other  forms  of  energy  generation,  including  those  discussed  in 
Table  9-5.  The  Appendix  K  lifecycle  estimate  is  somewhat  comparable  to  lifecycle  estimates  for 
renewable  energy  sources  but  about  an  order  of  magnitude  lower  than  those  for  fossil- fuel- 
based  resources.  The  text  in  Section  9.2.5  of  the  EIS  acknowledges  that  adding  fuel -cycle  and 
transportation  emissions  for  a  nuclear  power  plant  still  results  in  a  lower  emissions  footprint  than 
the  forms  of  energy  generation  discussed  in  Table  9-5  (i.e.,  coal,  natural  gas,  and  a  combination 
of  alternatives).  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

E.2.15  Comments  Concerning  Nonradiological  Health 

Comment:  Let  me  conclude  my  remarks  by  pointing  out  that  eminent  Scientist  James  Hanson 
recently  wrote,  that  the  world's  existing  nuclear  reactors  have  prevented  1.8  million  premature 
deaths  from  respiratory  diseases.  Consequently  the  Maryland  Conservation  Council  concludes 
that  significantly  more  respiratory  diseases  could  have  been  prevented,  and  considerably  less 
C02  would  be  in  the  atmosphere,  today,  if  construction  of  new  nuclear  reactors  had  not  been 
virtually  stopped  after  1980.  (0004-7-3  [Meadow,  Karen]) 

Comment:  A  very  eminent  climate  scientist,  whose  name  is  James  Hanson,  you  may  have 
heard  of,  he  is  outspoken,  and  has  incurred  the  wrath  of  the  fossil  fuel  industry.  As  published, 
recently,  in  the  New  York  Times,  an  article  that  claims  that  the  existing  nuclear  reactors  on  this 
planet,  have  prevented  1.8  million  premature  deaths  from  respiratory  diseases.  (0007-6-13

Comment:  Page  No.  2-185;  Section  No.  2.10.1.1;  Line  No.  29-30;  While  exhaust  emissions 
from  plant  operations  and  commuter  traffic  may  affect  local  air  quality,  the  causal  link  between 
these  activities  and  local  impacts  on  health  have  not  been  established.  This  sentence  should 
be  reworded  to  exclude  "human  health".  (0015-2-5  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  review  team  agrees  that  a  causal  link  is  not  established  between  exhaust 
emissions — associated  with  onsite  vehicles  and  eguipment  and  with  commuter  traffic  during 
normal  plant  operations — and  human  health  effects.  The  reference  to  human  health  has  been 
removed  from  the  text  in  the  EIS.

Response:  The  National  Institute  of  Allergy  and  Infectious  Diseases  lists  Naegleria  fowled  as 
Category  B  priority  human  pathogen  and,  along  with  its  preferred  habitat  of  thermophilic  waters, 
establishes  the  relevance  of  this  pathogen  to  areas  associated  with  water-cooled  nuclear  power 
plants.  However,  as  of  2012,  no  cases  of  primary  amebic  meningoencephalitis  have  been 
associated  with  areas  surrounding  the  Delaware  River.  The  text  in  Section  2.10.1.3  has  been 
revised  to  include  these  latest  statistics.

struck  by  object  or  equipment  and  roadway  (BLM,  Economic  News  Release,  Census  of  Fatal 
Occupational  Injuries  September  Summary  (September  1 1 , 2014)  (0015-3-17  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  For  the  reasons  stated  in  the  comment,  the  review  team  agrees  that  asphyxiation 
can  be  deleted  from  the  dominant  nonfatal  occupational  injury  description.  The  text  in  Section 
5.8.5  has  been  revised  to  incorporate  the  changes  recommended  in  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  7-41;  Section  No.  7.7;  Line  No.  29-30;  The  use  of  the  phrase  "their 
relationship  to"  is  unclear.  If  the  intent  of  the  sentence  is  to  discuss  the  effect  of  climate  change 
on  operation  of  the  nuclear  plant,  the  quoted  phrase  should  be  changed  to  "impact  on".  If  the 
intent  of  the  sentence  is  to  discuss  the  effect  of  the  nuclear  plant  on  the  consequences  of 
climate  change,  the  sentence  should  be  changed  to  indicate  that  the  nuclear  power  plant  will 
have  no  appreciable  impact  on  such  consequences.  (0015-4-11  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  phrase  "their  relationship "  refers  to  effect  of  the  nuclear  plant  on  the 
consequences  of  climate  change.  The  text  in  Section  7. 7  has  been  revised  to  provide  the

E.2.16  Comments  Concerning  Radiological  Health 

Comment:  I  am  also  here  as  a  cancer  patient  who  is  awaiting  radium  1 31 ,  of  1 00  millicuries,  in 
less  than  two  weeks,  for  thyroid  cancer  recurrence.  I  saw  a  flier  posted,  earlier,  that  talked 
about  the  risks  of  nuclear  medicine  and  radiation.  However,  the  difference  is  undergoing 
nuclear  medicine,  I  have  been  given  a  lot  of  instructions  about  what  to  do.  For  example,  I  will 
have  to  stay  away  from  my  family  for  two  to  four  days.  I  have  a  six  year  old  daughter.  I  will 
have  to  stay  away  from  her  for  nine  days.  This  is  very  hard  to  explain  to  her.  I  can't  hug, 
cuddle,  nap,  or  hold  an  infant  for  nine  days.  I  certainly  can't  have  children  for  six  months  to  a 
year,  or  be  breast  feeding.  If  I  was  a  man  with  a  pregnant  wife  I  couldn't  sleep  next  to  her  for  13 
days.  I  can  actually  sleep  next  to  my  husband  after  I  have  nuclear  medicine  treatment.  I  bring 
all  this  up  because  I'm  troubled  by  page  19  [in  the  Reader's  Guide],  and  the  exhibits  F  and  G,  in 
the  document,  the  Impact  Statement,  talk  about  the  radiological  health  impacts.  There  is  a 
diagram,  exhibit  F  and  G  [in  the  Reader's  Guide],  that  talks  about  how  during  the  construction  of 
this  plant,  there  will  be  radiation  getting  into  vegetables,  fish.  These  are  all  listed  on  pages  20 
and  21.  We  know  radiation  is  most  destructive  at  a  young  age.  I  actually  can't  even  absorb  a 
lot  of  radiation,  at  this  point,  because  I  don't  even  have  a  thyroid.  So  it  is  more  concerning  for 
the  younger  children  at  this  point.  And  I'm  wondering,  you  talk  about  small  dose,  small  dose, 
small  dose,  about  the  bioaccumulation  effects  of  this.  (0007-12-2  [Bucic,  Sarah]) 

Comment:  Will  there  be  tests,  or  have  there  been  tests  about  how  this  [exposure  to  radiation] 
will  impact  children  30  years  from  now,  since  we  know  that  radiation  takes  about  30  years,  at 
small  doses,  to  show  its  effects?  (0007-12-3  [Bucic,  Sarah]) 

Comment:  But  we,  ourselves,  are  exposed  from  routine  operation,  from  what  I  have  heard,  to 
as  much  radioactive  fallout,  as  the  Hiroshima  blast,  every  year,  for  every  operating  nuclear

power  plant.  This  stuff  is  bio  accumulative.  It  doesn't  leave  the  body.  In  fact  it  increases,  it 
causes  premature  aging,  it  causes  arthritis,  it  causes  degenerative  disease,  it  causes  genetic 
mutations  that  are  permanent,  and  will  go  down  for  succeeding  generations.  (0007-4-3  [Campion, 
Mary]) 

Comment:  And  not  only  that,  but  who  this  [nuclear  radiation]  affects  is  most  radically  children. 
Because  the  cesium  doesn't  just  come  routinely  through  the  air,  even  at  every  level,  but  it  is 
denser  where  the  children  live  and  play.  So  children,  when  they  are  in  their  most  vulnerable 
developmental  years,  are  highly  exposed.  I  know,  personally,  a  woman  who  was  in  utero  during 
Three  Mile  Island.  Her  mother  came  very  close  to  being  evacuated.  And  she  is  now 
experiencing  infertility  problems.  I  know  the  statistics  about  California,  how  many  miscarriages, 
of  the  same  type,  of  genetic  disorder,  that  my  friend  has  experienced,  have  occurred  since 
Fukushima  on  the  West  Coast.  This  is  what  we  are  looking  at.  It  is  very  insidious,  it  doesn't 
happen  in  a  single  state,  in  a  single  place.  And  we  don't  have  epidemiology.  I  remember  when 
we  lived  in  Colorado  there  was  a  public  health  employee  who  was  doing  epidemiology  in  the 
area  around  Rocky  Flats.  He  lost  his  job.  (0007-4-7  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Comment:  Let  me  also  mention,  finally,  that  the  Maryland  Conservation  Council  has  done  a 
thorough  study  of  the  epidemiologic  effects  of  exposure  to  radioactivity.  And  we  acquired  our 
data  from  the  primary  literature,  which  are  papers  published  mostly  from  cancer  researchers  at 
the  U.S.  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  and  from  Japanese  researchers,  who  have  been 
studying  the  effects  of  the  nuclear  weapon  bombings  on  the  survivors  in  Hiroshima  and 
Nagasaki.  These  studies  have  allowed,  led  us  to  conclude  that  the  threat  from  radioactivity  has 
been  exaggerated.  And,  as  I  said,  this  comes  from  the  primary  literature.  (0007-6-12  [Meadow, 
Norman]) 

Comment:  I  gather  from  the  hearing  that  the  site  is  already  toxic  and  workers  will  need 
protection.  And  yes  waste.  Ionizing  radiation  alters  the  continuity  of  healthy  life  in  ways  that 
may  take  generations  to  reveal.  The  damage  is  cumulative  and  passed  to  new  generations. 
Rosalie  Bertell  struggled  for  years  to  bring  the  dangers  of  x-rays  to  attention.  This  is  even  more 
opaque  and  long  lasting.  (0047-3  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Comment:  My  spiritual  friends,  the  pacifist  Buddhist  monks,  who  have  prayed  at  nuclear  sites 
all  over  the  world,  identified  Salem  as  the  most  lifeless  (toxic)  they  had  experienced.  They 
asked  the  young  people  to  quickly  leave  if  they  wished  to  have  children.  We,  and  all  life,  may 
pay  a  sad  price  for  this  facility.  (0047-7  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Response:  These  comments  concern  potential  human  health  effects  (e.g.,  cancer)  from 
radiation  exposure.  The  NRC's  mission  is  to  protect  the  public  health  and  safety  and  the 
environment  from  the  effects  of  radiation  from  nuclear  reactors,  materials,  and  waste  facilities. 
The  NRC's  regulatory  limits  for  radiological  protection  are  set  to  protect  workers  and  the  public 
from  the  harmful  health  effects  (i.e.,  cancer  and  other  biological  impacts)  of  radiation  on 
humans.  The  limits  are  based  on  the  recommendations  of  standards-setting  organizations.  The 
NRC  actively  participates  in  and  monitors  the  work  of  these  organizations  to  keep  current  on  the 
latest  trends  in  radiation  protection.

Radiation  standards  reflect  extensive  scientific  study  by  national  and  international  organizations. 
The  NRC  actively  participates  in  and  monitors  the  work  of  these  organizations  to  keep  current 
on  the  latest  trends  in  radiation  protection.  If  the  NRC  determines  that  there  is  a  need  to  revise 
its  radiation  protection  regulations,  it  will  initiate  a  rulemaking.  The  models  recognized  by  the 
NRC  are  for  use  by  nuclear  power  reactors  to  calculate  dose  incorporate  conservative 
assumptions  to  ensure  that  workers  and  members  of  the  public  are  adeguately  protected  from 
radiation.  In  addition,  NRC  dose  calculation  methods  have  always  included  age-specific  dose 
factors  for  each  radionuclide,  because  they  may  be  used  differently  by  infant,  child,  and  teen 
bodies,  which  are  also  generally  smaller  than  adult  bodies  recognizing  that  the  diets  (amounts 
of  different  kinds  of  food)  of  infants,  children,  and  teens  are  different  from  those  of  adults  (NRC 
1977). 

Radioactive  materials  can  be  helpful  to  diagnose  and  treat  illnesses  or  in  medical  research.  The 
NRC  or  an  Agreement  State  regulates  these  uses  with  the  aim  to  assure  radioactive  materials 
are  used  properly  and  in  a  way  that  protects  patients,  medical  workers,  the  public,  and  the 
environment.  Federal,  State  and  local  agencies  share  responsibility  for  overseeing  the  uses  of 
radiation  in  medicine.  In  developing  and  implementing  these  regulations,  the  NRC  follows  its 
Medical  Use  Policy  Statement  (65  FR  47654- TN4337).  The  policy  says  the  NRC  will: 

•  regulate  the  uses  of  radionuclides  in  medicine  to  provide  for  the  safety  of  workers  and  the 
public; 

•  not  intrude  into  medical judgments  affecting  patients,  except  as  necessary  to  provide  for  the 
safety  of  workers  and  the  public; 

•  regulate  radiation  safety  primarily  to  ensure  that  the  doctor's  directions  are  carried  out,  when 
justified  by  the  risk  to  the  patient;  and 

•  consider  industry  and  professional  standards  for  acceptable  approaches  to  radiation  safety. 

The  NRC  and  Agreement  States  license  facilities;  authorize  individuals  to  administer  radioactive 
materials;  and  develop  regulations  and  guidance.  The  regulations  also  provide  for  inspections, 
investigations  and  enforcement  programs  to  ensure  the  safety  of  medical  uses.  Please  see  the 
NRC  Fact  Sheet  on  the  medical  use  of  radioactive  materials  for  additional  information  (NRC 
2014-TN4338). 

Although  radiation  may  cause  cancers  at  high  doses,  currently  no  reputable,  scientifically 
conclusive  data  unequivocally  establishes  the  occurrence  of  cancer  following  exposure  to  low 
doses  (i.e.,  below  about  10  rem  [0. 1  SvJ).  However,  radiation  protection  experts  conservatively 
assume  that  any  amount  of  radiation  may  pose  some  risk  of  causing  cancer  or  a  severe 
hereditary  effect  and  that  the  risk  is  higher  for  higher  radiation  exposures.  Therefore,  a  linear, 
no-threshold,  dose  response  relationship  is  used  to  describe  the  relationship  between  radiation 
dose  and  adverse  impacts  such  as  incidents  of  cancer.  Simply  stated,  in  this  model,  any 
increase  in  dose,  no  matter  how  small,  results  in  an  incremental  increase  in  health  risk.  This 
theory  is  accepted  by  the  NRC  as  a  conservative  model  for  estimating  health  risks  from 
radiation  exposure,  recognizing  that  the  model  probably  overestimates  those  risks.  Based  on 
this  theory,  the  NRC  conservatively  establishes  limits  for  radioactive  effluents  and  radiation 
exposures  for  workers  and  members  of  the  public.  Although  the  public  dose  limit  in  10  CFR  20 
is  100  mrem  (1  mSv)  for  all  facilities  licensed  by  the  NRC,  the  NRC  has  imposed  additional 


NUREG-2168 


E-152 


November  2015 


Appendix  E 


constraints  on  nuclear  power  reactors.  Each  nuclear  power  reactor  has  enforceable  license 
conditions  that  limit  the  total  annual  whole  body  dose  to  a  member  of  the  public  outside  the 
facility  to  25  mrem  (0.25  mSv).  The  amount  of  radioactive  material  released  from  nuclear  power 
facilities  is  well  measured,  well  monitored,  and  known  to  be  very  small.  The  doses  of  radiation 
that  are  received  by  members  of  the  public  as  a  result  of  exposure  to  nuclear  power  facilities  are 
so  low  (i.e.,  less  than  a  few  millirem)  that  resulting  cancers  attributed  to  the  radiation  have  not 
been  observed  and  would  not  be  expected.  Such  low  levels  of  radiation  are  not  going  to  have  a 
noticeable  effect  on  the  long-term  health  of  children  (i.e.,  most  likely  result  in  zero  excess  health 
effects). 

In  addition  to  NRC's  reguirements  to  monitor  radioactive  effluents  (routine  and  inadvertent) 
discharged  into  the  environment,  each  nuclear  power  plant  is  reguired  to  have  a  radiological 
environmental  monitoring  program  (REMP).  The  REMP  guantifies  the  environmental  impacts 
associated  with  radioactive  effluent  releases  from  the  plant.  The  REMP  monitors  the 
environment  over  time,  starting  before  the  plant  operates  to  establish  background  radiation 
levels  and  continuing  throughout  its  operating  lifetime  to  monitor  radioactivity  in  the  local 
environment.  The  REMP  provides  a  mechanism  for  determining  the  levels  of  radioactivity  in  the 
environment  to  ensure  that  any  accumulation  of  radionuclides  released  into  the  environment  will 
not  become  significant  as  a  result  of  plant  operations.  The  REMP  also  measures  radioactivity 
from  other  nuclear  facilities  that  may  be  in  the  area  (e.g.,  other  nuclear  power  plants,  hospitals 
using  radioactive  material,  and  research  facilities). 

Finally,  although  a  number  of  studies  of  cancer  incidence  in  the  vicinity  of  nuclear  power 
facilities  have  been  conducted,  to  date,  no  studies  accepted  by  the  scientific  community  show  a 
correlation  between  radiation  dose  from  nuclear  power  facilities  and  cancer  incidence  in  the 
general  public.  Specific  studies  that  have  been  conducted  include: 

•  In  1990,  at  the  reguest  of  Congress,  the  National  Cancer  Institute  conducted  a  study  of 
cancer  mortality  rates  around  52  nuclear  power  plants  and  10  other  nuclear  facilities.  The 
study  covered  the  period  from  1950  to  1984  and  evaluated  the  change  in  mortality  rates 
before  and  during  facility  operations.  The  study  concluded  that  there  was  no  evidence  that 
nuclear  facilities  may  be  linked  causally  with  excess  deaths  from  leukemia  or  from  other 
cancers  in  populations  living  nearby. 

•  In  June  2000,  investigators  from  the  University  of  Pittsburgh  found  no  link  between  radiation 
released  during  the  1979  accident  at  the  Three  Mile  Island  power  plant  and  cancer  deaths 
among  nearby  residents.  Their  study  followed  32, 000  people  who  lived  within  5  mi  of  the 
plant  at  the  time  of  the  accident. 

•  In  January  2001,  the  Connecticut  Academy  of  Sciences  and  Engineering  issued  a  report  on 
a  study  around  the  Haddam  Neck  nuclear  power  plant  in  Connecticut  and  concluded  that 
radiation  emissions  were  so  low  as  to  be  negligible. 

•  The  American  Cancer  Society  in  2001  concluded  that  although  reports  about  cancer 
dusters  in  some  communities  have  raised  public  concern,  studies  show  that  clusters  do  not 
occur  more  often  near  nuclear  plants  than  they  do  by  chance  elsewhere  in  the  population. 
Likewise,  there  is  no  evidence  that  links  strontium-90  with  increases  in  breast  cancer, 
prostate  cancer,  or  childhood  cancer  rates.  Radiation  emissions  from  nuclear  power  plants 
are  closely  controlled  and  involve  negligible  levels  of  exposure  for  nearby  communities.

•  Also  in  2001,  the  Florida  Bureau  of  Environmental  Epidemiology  reviewed  claims  that  there 
are  striking  increases  in  cancer  rates  in  southeastern  Florida  counties  caused  by  increased 
radiation  exposures  from  nuclear  power  plants.  Elowever,  using  the  same  data  to 
reconstruct  the  calculations  on  which  the  claims  were  based,  Florida  officials  were  not  able 
to  identify  unusually  high  rates  of  cancers  in  these  counties  compared  with  the  rest  of  the 
state  of  Florida  and  the  nation. 

•  In  2000,  the  Illinois  Public  Flealth  Department  compared  childhood  cancer  statistics  for 
counties  with  nuclear  power  plants  to  similar  counties  without  nuclear  plants  and  found  no 
statistically  significant  difference. 

No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  The  water  [from  the  Fukushima  plant  in  Japan]  is  running  in  the  Pacific,  and  it  is 
destroying  the  Pacific  watershed.  Whatever  you  do,  don't  go  to  Red  Lobster  for  the  Alaskan 
king  crab  special,  because  the  shit  is  contaminated.  They  are  letting  food,  into  this  country, 
from  Japan  that  is  1 ,000  times  allowable,  that  the  Japanese  would  not  even  permit  in  their  own 
country.  So  be  careful  where  you  are  buying  your  food.  (0008-9-6  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  But  the  Fukushima  accident,  Chernobyl,  and  Three  Mile  Island,  have  contaminated 
this  planet,  already,  with  high  levels  of  radiation,  and  the  cancer  clusters  are  going  to  be 
showing  up.  Already  the  coast  of  California,  the  medical,  the  public  health  service  has 
determined  that  there  have  been  10,000  children,  that  have  died  from  that  accident.  (0008-9-9 
[August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  The  cumulative  threat  to  life  and  fertility  is  subtle  and  widespread.  There  may  be 
nothing  to  see  or  taste,  not  even  a  metallic  trace,  so  without  citizens  monitoring  (and  even  with 
counts)  it  may  be  difficult  to  locate  the  source.  It  seems  to  me  that  fallout  from  Fukushima  was 
arriving  here  in  snow  --  what  else  could  explain  the  high  readings  near  Philly;  like  random 
spikes?  (0047-5  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Response:  Given  the  great  distances  between  Fukushima  and  the  United  States  and  the  large 
amount  of  dilution  and  dispersion  that  would  occur  over  this  distance,  only  a  trace  amount  of 
radioactivity  was  detected  in  the  United  States  from  this  event.  Based  on  the  environmental 
measurements  made  to  date  by  government  agencies  and  non-government  organizations,  the 
Fukushima  Dai-ichi  accident  has  had  no  detectable  impact  on  human  health  in  the  United 
States.  In  particular,  EPA 's  air  monitoring  data  have  not  shown  any  radioactive  elements 
associated  with  the  damaged  Japanese  reactors  since  late  201 1,  and  even  then,  the  levels 
found  were  very  low— always  well  below  any  level  of  public  health  concern  (EPA  2015-  TN4217). 
Therefore,  attributing  any  deaths  in  the  U.S.,  especially  a  large  number  such  as  10,000  deaths, 
as  a  result  of  radioactivity  released  from  the  Fukushima  reactors  is  false  and  contrary  to 
validated  environmental  monitoring  data. 

The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  has  systems  in  place  to  help  ensure  that  our  food 
supply  is  wholesome,  safe  to  eat,  and  produced  under  sanitary  conditions.  To  date,  the  FDA 
has  no  evidence  that  radionuclides  from  the  Fukushima  incident  are  present  in  the  U.S.  food 
supply  at  levels  that  would  pose  a  public  health  concern.  This  is  true  for  both  FDA-regulated 
food  products  imported  from  Japan  and  U.S  domestic  food  products,  including  seafood  caught

off  the  coast  of  the  United  States.  Consequently,  the  FDA  is  not  advising  consumers  to  alter 
their  consumption  of  specific  foods  imported  from  Japan  or  domestically  produced  foods, 
including  seafood.  The  FDA  continues  to  closely  monitor  the  situation  at  and  around  the 
Fukushima  Dai-ichi  facility,  as  it  has  since  the  start  of  the  incident  and  will  coordinate  with  other 
Federal  and  State  agencies  as  necessary,  standing  ready  to  take  action  if  needed,  to  ensure  the 
safety  of  food  in  the  U.S.  marketplace  (FDA  2014-TN4218). 

No  changes  were  made  in  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  [0]ysters  are  filter  feeding  bivalves  that  are  known  to  accumulate,  and  in  some 
cases  bioconcentrate,  radionuclides  typically  found  in  effluents  from  nuclear  power  plants  such 
as  cobalt-58,  cobalt-60,  zinc-65,  and  silver-1 10.  Effluent  specific  radionuclides  have  been  found 
in  oysters  as  far  as  7.5  miles  from  the  point  of  discharge  of  nuclear  power  plants  (McLean,  R.I., 
J.K.  Summers,  K.A.  Rose,  and  S.  L.  Domotor,  1987.  Silver  110,  Cobalt-58,  and  Zinc-65 
Concentrations  in  the  American  Oyster,  Crassostrea  Virginica  (Gmelin),  Near  the  Calvert  Cliffs 
Nuclear  Power  Plant,  Maryland  Power  Plant  Research  Program,  December  1987).  The 
proximity  of  some  of  the  Delaware  Bay  oyster  beds  to  the  PSEG  Site,  and  the  practice  of 
transplanting  large  numbers  of  oysters  from  beds  near  the  site  to  downstream  beds  that  support 
a  significant  commercial  fishery,  make  oyster  consumption  an  important  potential  exposure 
pathway  to  man.  As  such,  that  pathway  should  be  monitored  as  part  of  an  effective 
Radiological  Environmental  Monitoring  Program  (REMP)  for  the  proposed  facility.  (0021-1-4 
[Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  Section  7. 3. 2. 5  "Climate  Change",  Page  7-29,  Lines  1-16:  This  section  of  the  EIS 
references  a  201 1  report  by  the  Partnership  for  the  Delaware  Estuary  that  examines  the 
potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  marine  bivalve  shellfish  populations  in  the  Delaware 
Estuary  (PDE  201 1-TN2190).  According  to  that  report,  the  combined  effects  of  climate  change, 
rising  sea  level,  channel  deepening,  and  increasing  demands  for  freshwater  from  the  Delaware 
River  and  nearby  aquifers  will  result  in  a  significant  increase  in  the  salinity  of  Delaware  Bay.  As 
a  result,  it  is  expected  that  the  oyster  population  will  expand  further  up  the  estuary,  towards  the 
PSEG  Site.  In  that  scenario,  the  populations  located  in  down  bay  areas  that  currently  support 
most  of  the  commercial  fishery  (Direct  Market  Beds)  would  be  depleted  by  the  diseases  that  are 
more  prevalent  in  high  salinity  conditions.  The  oyster  populations  in  the  upper  bay,  located  just 
downstream  from  the  PSEG  Site,  and  that  currently  serve  primarily  as  a  source  of  transplants  to 
replenish  the  down  bay  Direct  Market  beds,  would  then  become  the  center  of  the  commercial 
oyster  harvest.  The  location  of  a  large  commercial  oyster  fishery  just  downstream  from  three 
existing  nuclear  power  plants,  and  potentially  one  or  two  additional  units,  would  result  in  a 
significant  increase  in  the  frequency  of  occurrence  and  concentration  of  effluent  specific 
radionuclides  in  oysters  that  are  sold  for  human  consumption.  Therefore,  that  exposure 
pathway  should  be  monitored  as  part  of  an  effective  Radiological  Environmental  Monitoring 
Program  (REMP)  for  the  proposed  facility.  (0021-1-8  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  Consistent  with  the  NRC's  mission  of  protecting  the  public  health  and  safety,  NRC 
regulations  require  radiological  monitoring  to  ensure  that  dose  limits  for  workers  and  the  public 
are  not  exceeded.  In  Section  6.2  of  the  ER,  PSEG  indicated  that  the  existing  PSEG  REMP  will 
serve  as  the  new  plant  operational  radiological  monitoring  program  with  additional  onsite

thermoluminescent  dosimetry.  Therefore,  what  is  sampled  under  the  current  REMP  would  also 
be  applied  to  a  proposed  new  reactor  if  it  was  eventually  built  and  operated. 

A  licensee's  REMP  is  subject  to  periodic  NRC  inspections  in  order  to  validate  the  effectiveness 
of  the  radioactive  gaseous  and  liquid  effluent  release  program  which  would  include  inspecting 
sample  collection,  monitoring,  and  dose  measurement  stations.  The  latest  integrated  inspection 
report  which  includes  the  inspection  of  PS  EG 's  REMP  was  issued  on  January  30,  20  i  5  (see 
ADAMS  Accession  No.  ML  14212A656).  The  staff  understands  that  representatives  from  the 
NJDEP  have  observed  prior  inspections  including  the  integrated  inspection  discussed  in  the 
January  30,  2015  report. 

Due  to  the  nature  of  the  comment  regarding  the  current  and  future  REMP  for  the  existing 
reactors,  the  appropriate  staff  in  the  Office  Nuclear  Reactor  Regulation  and  Region  /  who  have 
responsibility  with  oversight  of  the  SGS  and  HCGS  were  notified  of  the  comments  for  any 
appropriate  actions  or  discussions  with  PS  EG  and  the  State  of  New  Jersey  on  this  matter. 

No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  based  on  these  comments. 

Comment:  Page  No.  5-89;  Section  No.  5. 9. 3. 2;  Line  No.  20-23;  The  DEIS  states:  "The  annual 
collective  dose  to  the  populations  projected  to  live  within  50  mi  of  PSEG  in  the  year  2081  was 
not  considered  because,  as  stated  in  Section  5.9.1,  direct  dose  contributions  from  the  PSEG 
Site  would  be  bounded  by  the  ABWR  design."  What  is  the  basis  for  this  statement?  PSEG  does 
not  state  anywhere  in  the  ER  that  the  public  dose  for  the  year  2081  was  not  performed  because 
the  ABWR  is  the  bounding  technology  from  a  radioactive  release  perspective.  (0015-3-18 
[Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  acknowledges  this  comment  and  has  replaced  this  sentence  with 
the  following:  "The  estimated  collective  dose  to  the  same  population  from  natural  background 
radiation  is  estimated  as  approximately  2, 53 1, 000  person-rem/yr.  The  dose  from  natural 
background  radiation  was  calculated  by  multiplying  the  50-mi  radius  population  estimate 
(8, 138,635)  for  the  year  2081  by  the  annual  background  dose  rate  (311  mrem/yr)  (NCRP 
2009). " 

Section  5. 9. 3. 2  was  revised  in  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  2.11  "Radiological  Environment",  Page  2-191 ,  Lines  2-3:  As  part  of  the 
discussion  of  the  groundwater  contamination  caused  by  the  spent  fuel  pool  leak  at  SGS  Unit  1 , 
the  NRC  states  that  "No  contamination  is  believed  to  have  migrated  to  the  unrestricted  area." 
The  direction  of  groundwater  flow  in  the  area  of  concern  however,  is  towards  the  nearby 
Delaware  River,  and  the  licensee's  groundwater  monitoring  data  indicate  that  at  least  some  of 
the  contaminated  groundwater  has  migrated  into  the  river  and  therefore  into  the  unrestricted 
area.  Monitoring  Well  AG-S  for  example,  is  a  shallow  monitoring  well  (24.2  ft.  below  ground 
surface)  located  approximately  360  ft.  down  gradient  from  the  source  of  contamination  (seismic 
gap)  and  only  40  ft.  from  the  bank  of  the  Delaware  River.  Tritium  concentrations  as  high  as 
33,200  pCi/L  have  been  observed  in  groundwater  samples  from  this  well  (January  2005).  In 
addition,  although  the  spent  fuel  pool  leak  was  discovered  in  2002,  it  was  not  until  June  of  2013 
that  the  licensee  determined  that  the  contamination  had  reached  the  deeper  Vincentown  Aquifer

as  well  as  the  shallow,  water  bearing  unit.  Well  AA-V  was  installed  in  the  Vincentown  Aquifer 
(85  ft.  below  ground  surface)  in  May  of  2013  and  is  located  approximately  130  feet  from  the 
river  bank.  Tritium  concentrations  in  groundwater  samples  from  Well  AA-V  have  ranged  from 
7,000  to  13,000  pCi/L,  several  times  higher  than  the  tritium  concentrations  observed  at  the 
same  location  in  the  shallow,  water  bearing  unit  (Well  AA).  The  installation  of  additional 
monitoring  wells  will  be  required  in  order  to  properly  characterize  the  extent  of  the  contamination 
in  the  Vincentown  Aquifer.  However,  the  available  data  suggest  that  at  least  some  of  the 
contaminated  groundwater  in  this  deeper  formation  has  discharged  or  will  discharge  into  the 
Delaware  River.  In  fact,  the  licensee  has  performed  a  mass  flux  estimation  of  the  quantity  of 
tritium  reaching  the  Delaware  River.  They  estimated  that  0.01 1  curies  per  year  could  reach  the 
Delaware  River  from  the  shallow,  water  bearing  unit,  and  0.066  curies  per  year  could  reach  the 
river  from  the  deeper  groundwater  (Mass  Flux  Estimation  Memo,  PSEG  Nuclear  LLC,  Salem

Ruth]) 

Response:  The  unrestricted  area  noted  by  the  comment  is  in  relation  to  PSEG's  evaluations 
not  identifying  any  immediate  health  and  safety  consequences  of  members  of  the  public  living 
nearby  or  who  maybe  on  the  Delaware  River  nearby  the  PSEG  Site.  The  staff  has  reviewed  the 
cited  report  along  with  quarterly  remedial  action  plan  reports  regarding  groundwater  mitigation 
actions  for  the  SGS  reactors  and  tritium  mass  flux  estimation  into  the  Delaware  River.  As  noted 
by  PSEG  in  the  2013  annual  effluent  release  report  that  "[t]he  GRS  [groundwater  recovery 
system]  is  fully  discussed  in  the  quarterly  Remedial  Action  Progress  Reports  (RAPR)  provided 
to  the  State  and  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  by  PSEG.  Some  of  the  wells  on  the 
plant  perimeter  have  detectable  tritium:  PSEG  has  conservatively  assumed  that  the  tritium  has 
reached  the  Delaware  River,  calculated  the  resultant  exposure  and  included  the  results  in  the 
liquid  effluent  data  reported  earlier  in  this  document. "  ( see  page  115  in  PSEG  2014-TN4219). 
The  resulting  annual  quantity  of  tritium  conservatively  estimated  to  have  reached  the  Delaware 
River  from  this  tritium  plume  of  approximately  0.08  Ci  is  a  small  fraction  of  the  annual 
radioactive  liquid  effluent  release  of  tritium  of  approximately  700  Ci  from  SGS  Unit  1  and  2  and 
HCGS  for  2013  (PSEG  201 4-TN421 9  and  PSEG  201 4 -TN 4 220).  The  text  in  Section  2. 1 1  of  the 
EIS  has  been  revised  to  clarify  between  the  potential  for  exposure  from  tritium  in  the 
groundwater  to  members  of  the  public  offsite  along  with  clarification  on  tritium  carried  by 
groundwater  likely  reaching  the  Delaware  River.  Because  a  portion  of  the  comment  concerns 
installation  of  additional  monitoring  wells  for  the  existing  remedial  actions,  the  appropriate  staff 
in  the  Office  Nuclear  Reactor  Regulation  and  Region  I  who  have  responsibility  with  oversight  of 
the  SGS  and  HCGS  were  notified  of  the  comments  for  any  appropriate  actions  or  discussions 
with  PSEG  and  the  State  of  New  Jersey  on  this  matter. 

E.2.17  Comments  Concerning  Nonradiological  Waste 

Comment:  Page  No.  10-9;  Section  No.  10.2.1;  Table  10-1;  The  table  states  that  there  is  a 
minor  decrease  in  capacity  of  waste  treatment  and  disposal  facilities  as  an  unavoidable  adverse 
impact  associated  with  non-radiological  waste.  This  is  not  discussed/identified  elsewhere  in  the 
DEIS  (0015-7-6  [Mallon,  James])

Response:  In  response  to  this  comment,  the  text  in  Table  1 0-1  has  been  revised  to  state  that 
an  unavoidable  impact  of  construction  and  operation  is  the  minor  increased  consumption  of 
landfill  space  for  disposition  of  nonradiological  wastes. 

E.2.18  Comments  Concerning  Design  Basis  Accidents 

Comment:  As  you  know  about  80  percent  of  the  people  within  the  affected  zone,  if  there  is  an 
accident,  live  here  in  Delaware.  That  is  based  on,  I  believe,  your  2008  numbers.  Just  this  week 
the  new  census  neighbor  numbers  came  out  of  the  American  Community  Survey.  I  would  ask 
that  you  update  it  to  use  that  data,  because  Southern  New  Castle  County  has  expanded 
considerably,  particularly  along  the  Route  9  corridor,  which  is  where  I  live,  and  where  the  other 
things  are.  (0007-2-3  [Carter,  David]) 

Response:  As  discussed  in  Section  5.11.2.1  the  accident  calculations  have  been  performed 
with  the  population  projections  for  the  year  2081.  Therefore,  this  comment  has  already  been 
addressed  in  the  EIS.  No  changes  have  been  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  There  are  some  concerns  I  have  with  the  communities,  and  I  already  saw,  on  the 
report,  that  there  are  no  expected  impacts  to  EJ  communities.  I  think  there  are  some  problems 
with  that,  particularly,  if  you  do  have  an  accident.  I  think  there  are  some  serious  impacts 
particularly  to  the  lower  end  border  communities  in  the  rural  areas  around  the  plant  in  Delaware. 
(0007-2-4  [Carter,  David]) 

Response:  Section  5. 1 1  describes  the  environmental  impacts  of  postulated  accidents,  both 
design  basis  accidents  (DBAs)  and  severe  accidents.  The  impacts  to  minorities  or  low-income 
communities  would  not  be  different  than  the  impacts  to  other  communities.  This  comment 
provides  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS 
as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  5-101;  Section  No.  5.11.1;  Line  No.  24-26;  The  DEIS  states:  "These 
evaluations  used  a  set  of  surrogate  DBAs  representative  for  each  of  the  reactor  designs  being 
considered  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  site-specific  meteorological  data."  This  statement  is  not 
accurate.  SSAR  Section  15.1,  page  15.1-1,  states:  "Although  PSEG  is  using  the  plant 
parameter  envelope  (PPE)  approach  discussed  in  Chapter  1,  each  technology  is  evaluated 
individually  within  this  chapter.  The  analysis  is  performed  for  a  broad  spectrum  of 
representative  postulated  design  basis  accidents  (DBA)  to  determine  the  bounding  radiological 
consequences  that  affect  the  safe  design  and  siting  of  an  advanced  light-water  reactor.  The 
selected  accidents  are  based  on  the  LWR  technologies  being  considered  for  development  and 
the  regulatory  guidance  for  performing  DBA  analysis."  (0015-3-19  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  statement  in  the  EIS  is  accurate  and  consistent  with  the  text  in  the  SSAR.  The 
DBAs  are  selected  as  described  in  the  PSEG  SSAR  (Section  15. 1)  and  in  the  PSEG  ER 
(Section  7. 1).  The  new  nuclear  reactor  designs  considered  at  this  site  are  either  certified  or 
under  design  certification  review.  Therefore,  their  design  parameters  are  well  established  and 
the  word  "surrogate"  for  the  DBAs  is  not  needed.  To  make  the  text  of  the  EIS  and  the  SSAR 
more  consistent,  the  word  "surrogate"  has  been  deleted  in  Section  5.11.1  of  the  EIS.

Comment:  Page  No.  7-45;  Section  No.  7.10;  This  section  states  that  consideration  was  given 
to  nuclear  plants  within  a  50-mile  radius  of  the  PSEG  ESP  site,  and  it  refers  to  Oyster  Creek, 
TMI,  and  Calvert  Cliffs.  However,  all  of  those  plants  are  more  than  50  miles  from  the  PSEG 
ESP  site,  as  discussed  on  page  7-3  of  the  DEIS.  Therefore,  either  reference  to  those  plants 
should  be  deleted,  or  the  reference  to  the  50-mile  radius  should  be  deleted.  (0015-4-12  [Mallon, 
James]) 

Response:  Section  7. 10,  Postulated  Accidents,  of  the  EIS,  third  paragraph,  states:  "The 
cumulative  analysis  considers  risk  from  potential  severe  accidents  at  all  other  existing  and 
proposed  nuclear  power  plants  that  have  the  potential  to  increase  risks  at  any  location  within 
50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  50-mi  radius  was  selected  to  cover  any  potential  overlaps  from 
two  or  more  nuclear  plants. "  Therefore,  nuclear  plants  that  are  located  less  than  100  mi  from  the 
PSEG  Site  need  to  be  considered,  since  there  will  be  overlaps  of  the  50-mi  radius  of  the  PSEG 
Site  with  the  50-mi  radii  of  the  surrounding  nuclear  plants.  No  changes  have  been  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Finally,  the  proposed  site  puts  Delawareans  at  RISK.  The  three  existing  reactors, 
Salem  reactors  1  &  2  and  Hope  Creek,  are  built  in  the  Delaware  River.  While  the  address  of  the 
artificial  island  is  in  NJ,  over  80%  of  the  population  living  with  the  10  mile  "plume  exposure 
pathway"  lives  in  Delaware.  (0036-3  [Cornelia,  Jared]) 

Response:  The  risks  and  consequences  of  accidents  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  addressed  in  detail 
in  Sections  5.11.1  and  5. 1 1.2.  The  calculated  environmental  risks  for  a  new  reactor  or  reactors 
at  the  PSEG  Site  are  very  small,  in  fact,  smaller  than  the  risks  of  current  reactors  already 
operating  at  this  site  or  at  near  sites  (in  Tables  5-30  and  5-31).  The  proposed  new  reactors  are 
advanced  reactor  designs  with  reduced  risks  when  compared  to  current  reactor  designs.  The 
presence  of  a  new  reactor  (or  reactors)  at  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  significantly  change  the 
overall  environmental  risk  in  the  area.  This  comment  provides  no  new  information  for 
consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

E.2.19  Comments  Concerning  Severe  Accidents 

Comment:  And  for  all  the  jobs  that  may  be  created  by  this  plant,  there  is  a  significant  risk  if  we 
get  this  wrong,  of  the  job  loss  of  making  an  area  inhabitable.  We  cannot  trade  the  prospect  of  a 
few  thousand  jobs  with  the  loss  of  a  livelihood  of  an  entire  area,  if  we  get  this  wrong,  particularly 
on  nuclear  waste.  (0007-11-7  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Response:  Section  5. 1 1  describes  the  environmental  impacts  of  postulated  accidents,  both 
DBAs  (Section  5. 1 1. 1)  and  severe  accidents  (Section  5. 1 1.2).  The  environmental  risks 
associated  with  adding  a  reactor  (or  two  reactors)  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  very  small  and  well 
below  NRC  safety  goals  (addressed  in  Section  5. 1 1.2. 1  and  Table  5-30  of  the  EIS).  This 
comment  provides  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were  made 
to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  These  plants  are  nothing  more  but  staged  nuclear  weapons.  Three  Mile  Island, 
Chernobyl,  and  Fukushima,  have  proved  that.  You  have  four  core  meltdowns  going  on  down, 
right  now,  and  China  Syndrome,  and  they  can’t  do  anything  about  it,  because  they  don't  have

the  technology.  You  can't  get  close  enough  to  those  reactors  without  robots.  They  don't  even 
have  robots  designed  to  fix  it.  (0007-3-19  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  This  power  plant,  across  the  river,  has  every  bit  of  nuclear  waste,  from  the  time  that 
it  began  to  operate.  If  there  were  a  crisis,  there,  it  would  not  be  another  Fukushima.  It  would  be 
six  times  Fukushima.  At  Fukushima,  within  88  miles,  they  have  already  found  that  this  land  is 
toxic,  it  is  toxic  in  perpetuity.  All  of  that  farmland  in  New  Jersey,  toxic  in  perpetuity. 

Philadelphia,  toxic  in  perpetuity.  (0007-4-6  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Comment:  And  if  you  saw  what  happened  in  Japan,  people  right  now  are  voluntarily 
evacuating  out  of  Tokyo  because  of  the  explosions  that  happened  at  Fukushima.  They  don't 
even  have  the  technology  to  stop  the  China  Syndrome  that  is  going  on  right  now.  They  don't. 
They  are  in  a  technological  shift,  to  make  robots  to  go  in,  because  human  beings  can't  be 
exposed  for  no  longer  than  five  minutes,  to  some  of  the  stuff  that  they  have  to  get  near  of.  They 
have  been  hit  with  two  typhoons  in  the  last  two  weeks.  (0008-9-5  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  [The  EIS]  tries  to  mitigate  concerns  of  a  nuclear  catastrophe  by  pointing  to  the 
recent  catastrophe  at  Fukushima  and  "lessons  learned"  from  that  event.  I  wonder  if  the  people 
living  near  Fukushima  were  given  similar  assurances  when  that  facility  was  being  proposed?  I 
wonder  if  the  people  living  in  the  shadow  of  Chernobyl  were  given  assurances  that  this  was 
good  for  them  and  what  happened  at  Three  Mile  Island  in  the  United  States  could  never  happen 
in  Russia.  No  matter  how  remote  or  unlikely,  not  to  consider  the  ramifications  of  such  an  event 
would  be  irresponsible  and  should  weigh  heavily  on  granting  approval.  After  all,  we  don't  want 
the  PSEG  Salem  Nuclear  site  be  someone  else's  reference  for  "lessons  learned?"  (0012-7 
[Magyar,  David]) 

Response:  Section  5. 7  7  of  the  EIS  describes  the  environmental  impacts  of  postulated 
accidents,  both  DBAs  and  severe  accidents.  The  NRC,  in  its  entirety,  takes  seriously  its  role  for 
ensuring  adequate  protection  of  the  public's  health  and  safety.  To  this  end,  the  NRC  has  taken 
various  actions  and  is  continuing  to  evaluate  ways  for  enhancing  the  safety  at  U.S.  reactors 
based  on  specific  lessons  learned  from  the  event  at  Japan's  Fukushima  Dai-ichi  nuclear  power 
plant  to  address  the  concerns  raised  by  the  commenters.  The  additional  measures  to  be 
implemented  after  the  Fukushima  accident  are  also  described  in  Section  5.1  T  Basically,  they 
include  additional  protection  against  severe  natural  phenomena  (e.g.,  earthquake  and  flooding), 
improved  mitigation  of  the  effects  of  such  events  (e.g.,  restore  and  maintain  long-term  cooling  of 
the  reactor  core  and  the  spent  fuel  pool),  better  coping  with  emergencies,  and  improving  the 
effectiveness  of  NRC  programs.  In  its  final  SER,  the  applicant  will  address  the  additional  safety 
measures  taken  from  the  lessons  learned  from  the  Fukushima  accident. 

The  NRC  does  not  expect  that  the  cited  accidents  will  occur  again,  but  the  possibility  cannot  be 
entirely  eliminated.  No  death  or  fatality  attributable  to  nuclear  power  operation  will  ever  be 
acceptable  in  the  sense  that  the  Commission  would  regard  it  as  a  routine  or  permissible  event.

These  comments  provide  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Similarly  if  there  was  an  incident  at  the  nuclear  plant,  what  would  happen  to  the 
other  facilities  that  are  very  dangerous,  that  need  to  be  constantly  staffed,  to  make  sure  that  an 
emergency,  another  emergency  at  one  of  those  does  not  happen.  (0008-4-5  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Response:  Other  chemical/industrial  facilities  have  their  own  emergency  plans  in  case  of  a 
general  evacuation  of  the  area  (due  to  weather  or  other  industrial  accidents) — their  emergency 
plans  are  not  within  the  scope  of  this  EIS.  Emergency  preparedness  for  the  new  proposed 
nuclear  plant  will  be  addressed  by  the  applicant  in  the  SER.  No  changes  have  been  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  After  attending  the  public  meeting  on  the  evening  of  October  23,  2014,  in 
Middletown,  DE  and  having  the  opportunity  to  ask  a  question  and  after  reviewing  the  information 
provided  in  the  U.S.NRC’s  DEIS  for  an  ESP  at  the  PSEG  site  Readers  Guide,  I  have  come 
away  with  the  following  concerns:  that  neither  the  presentation  nor  the  EIS  documentation 
address  local/national  economic,  social,  or  health  issues  that  might  arise  as  a  result  of  a  severe 
or  catastrophic  event  that  would  result  in  the  release  of  significant  amounts  of  radioactive 
materials  into  the  environment.  (0012-1  [Magyar,  David]) 

Comment:  Information  presented  in  the  EIS  chapter  5.1 1  regarding  the  impact  of  a  nuclear 
accident  focused  mainly  on  measures  taken  to  prevent  such  an  event  and  provided  little  or  no 
information  on  the  actual  economic,  social  and  health  implications  of  such  an  event.  What  little 
information  there  was  in  the  31  pages  of  the  1500  page  report,  that  addressed  the 
consequences  of  a  major  release  of  radiation,  was  much  too  technical  and  the  summary  did 
nothing  to  put  into  context  the  overall  effect  of  such  an  event.  In  fact  the  summary  minimized 
the  impact  such  an  event  would  have  by  categorizing  the  impact  level  as  "small."  The  report 
blatantly  overlooks  the  potential  impact  to  a  region  that  is  critical  to  the  security  and  well  being 
of  the  country.  It  overlooks  the  consequences  of  aggregating  as  many  as  five  reactors  in  one 
location.  When  one  takes  into  account  the  areas  included  in  the  50  mi  impact  zone,  one  must 
consider  that  the  sites  proximity  to  major  centers  of  commerce,  population,  transportation  and 
national  defense  facilities  make  it  a  prime  target  for  anyone  seeking  to  have  a  major  impact  on 
our  country.  (0012-4  [Magyar,  David]) 

Response:  The  risks  of  severe  accidents  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  addressed  in  EIS  Section 
5. 1  1.2.  The  Commission's  policy  statement  on  "Nuclear  Power  Plant  Accident  Considerations 
Under  the  National  Environmental  Pol  ley  Act  of  1969"  (45  FR  40101-TN4270)  directs  the  NRC 
staff  to  discuss  the  environmental  impacts  of  severe  accidents  in  probabilistic  terms  (i.e.,  risk). 
Economic,  health,  and  social  risks  are  addressed  in  this  section  with  results  provided  in  Tables 
5-26,  5-27,  5-28,  and  5-29.  The  cumulative  effects  of  several  nuclear  plants  interacting  in  the 
same  area  are  also  considered  and  addressed  in  Section  7. 10,  by  adding  the  risks  from 
potential  severe  accidents  from  any  existing  and  proposed  nuclear  power  plants  that  have  the 
potential  to  increase  the  risk  at  any  location  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Any  nuclear  plant 
(either  existing  or  future)  located  less  than  100  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site  is  considered  for 
cumulative  risks.  After  all  those  risks  from  interacting  nuclear  power  plants  are  added,  the 
overall  risk  impact  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  categorized  as  SMALL.  Comments  related  to  security

and  terrorism  are  safety  issues  that  are  not  within  the  scope  of  the  NRC  staff's  environmental 
review  and  are  regulated  by  10  CFR  73,  " Physical  Protection  of  Nuclear  Power  and  Materials. " 
These  comments  provide  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  I  think  it  is  really  important  to  think  that,  that  this  is  not  something  that  will  only 
affect  us,  and  only  benefit  us.  But  once  this  --  if  there  is  an  accident,  once  it  is  out,  it  is  there 
forever.  (0007-4-10  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Comment:  If  an  event  should  occur  that  required  the  evacuation  of  and  possible  abandonment 
of  the  50  mi.  impact  zone,  virtually  the  entire  state  of  Delaware,  most  of  southern  New  Jersey, 
most  of  the  Philadelphia  and  parts  of  the  Baltimore  metropolitan  areas  would  have  to  be 
evacuated;  the  Northeast  transportation  corridor  would  have  to  be  abandoned;  both  the 
Delaware  and  Chesapeake  bays  would  be  contaminated  closing  them  to  shipping  as  well  as  a 
source  of  food  and  water;  millions  of  people  would  lose  their  homes,  their  jobs  and  their  health. 
How  this  could  be  considered  a  "small"  level  of  impact  is  beyond  reason.  (0012-5  [Magyar, 

David]) 

Comment:  When  one  weighs  the  potential  for  catastrophic  impact  one  has  to  consider  that 
there  may  not  be  any  good  place  to  put  a  nuclear  reactor  in  the  state  of  New  Jersey  or  for  that 
matter,  anywhere  else  along  the  northeast  coast.  (0012-8  [Magyar,  David]) 

Comment:  Why  use  an  energy  source  that  has  such  disastrous  consequences  if  something 
goes  wrong?  (Human  error,  natural  disaster  or  a  terroristic  strike  for  example.)  Delaware 
residents  make  up  the  majority  of  the  population  who  live  within  the  current  10-mile  evacuation 
zone.  (0024-3  [Doyle,  Kathy]) 

Comment:  I  am  concerned  that,  if  built,  this  would  be  the  largest  nuclear  facility  in  the  US,  and 
would  be  close  to  population,  business,  and  government  centers,  with  potentially  catastrophic 
effects  if  something  were  to  go  wrong  in  a  worst  case  scenario.  (0032-11  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  Regarding  the  future  of  my  granddaughter  and  the  other  children  of  the  area  in  the 
event  of  a  big  problem  at  Salem,  in  the  aftermath  of  past  disasters  (Hiroshima,  Nagasaki, 
Chernobyl,  Fukushima),  once  a  person  is  branded  as  a  "survivor,"  they  face  many  social 
stigmas.  They  become  undesirable  marriage  partners.  Many  people  at  the  public  meetings  in 
NJ  and  DE  expressed  their  thankfulness  for  the  jobs  provided  them,  but  at  whose  expense  are 
these  jobs?  Possibly  their  children's.  (0046-2  [Campion,  George]) 

Response:  The  risks  of  severe  accidents  at  the  PS  EG  Site  are  addressed  in  detail  in  Section 
5. 1 1.2.  The  calculated  environmental  risks  for  a  new  reactor  or  reactors  at  the  PSEG  Site  are 
very  small,  in  fact,  smaller  than  the  risks  of  current  reactors  already  operating  at  this  site  or  at 
near  sites  (in  Tables  5-30  and  5-31).  The  proposed  new  reactors  are  advanced  reactor  designs 
with  reduced  risks  when  compared  to  current  reactor  designs.  The  presence  of  a  new  reactor 
(or  reactors)  at  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  significantly  change  the  overall  environmental  risk  in  the 
area.  These  comments  provide  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and  therefore,  no 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments.

E.2.20  Comments  Concerning  the  Uranium  Fuel  Cycle 

Comment:  We  worried  about  safety  issues  and,  even  more,  about  the  lack  of  a  long-term  safe 
repository  for  nuclear  waste.  We  were  not  experts  but  we  believe  our  concerns  were  real. 
(0004-4-3  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  I'm  not  here  to  debate  the  safety  of  nuclear  power.  I  have  great  confidence  in  what 
has  been  done  with  the  industry  so  far.  But  to  build  on  a  point  of  the  official  from  PSEG,  no  new 
good  nuclear  without  old  good  nuclear.  Well,  we  haven't  solved  the  problems  of  old  good 
nuclear,  if  we  still  have  waste  piling  up  at  these  plants.  (0007-11-10  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Comment:  And  I  would  submit,  if  you  look  at  the  financials  of  PSEG,  that  they  are  not  putting 
the  proper  set-asides,  and  reserves,  for  the  cost  of  the  removal  and  long-term  storage  of  that 
waste.  I  don't  believe  many  across  the  country  are  doing  this.  (0007-11-11  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Comment:  But  I  really  would  call  on  a  moratorium  on  licensing  renewals,  and  expansion,  until 
the  current  waste  issue  is  removed  and  solved.  No  debate.  I  was  promised  this  back  in  the 
'70s.  I  was  told,  by  these  engineers,  who  are  unfortunately  dead  and  gone  now,  that  this  issue 
would  be  solved  by  the  end  of  the  century.  And  it  is  not  fair,  because  now  I  have  children  who 
have  been  born,  and  children  who  will  continue  to  be  bom,  they  didn't  buy  into  this  risk.  And  yet 
they  are  going  to  be  paying  for  this  risk,  particularly,  if  we  get  it  wrong.  So  I'm  here  to  urge  that 
today.  There  is  a  lot  to  debate  in  this  EIS  process.  But  the  black  and  white  issue  here  is,  until 
we  have  a  waste  disposal  and  removal,  and  storage  place  in  place,  we  are  not  going  to  get  it 
done.  We  should  have  a  moratorium.  Because  without  a  moratorium  no  one  is  paying  attention 
to  it,  no  one  is  listening.  (0007-11-13  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Comment:  I  will  just  close  by  just  quoting  from  these  documents,  right  here,  from  the  document 
that  is  provided  as  a  background  on  radioactive  waste.  It  says,  very  simply,  that  on  storage  and 
disposal,  at  this  time,  there  are  no  facilities  for  permanent  disposal  of  high-level  radioactive 
waste.  And  that  since  the  only  way  radioactive  waste  finally  becomes  harmless  is  through 
decay,  which  are  —  some  isotopes  contained  in  high  level  waste  can  take  hundreds  of 
thousands  of  years.  The  waste  must  be  stored  in  a  way  that  provides  adequate  protection  for  a 
very  long  time.  I  don't  want  to  continue  to  face  that  risk  in  our  own  back  yard.  And  it  says,  here, 
that  the  Department  of  Energy  is  preparing  a  license,  to  submit  to  the  NRC,  for  construction  and 
authorization  for  a  repository  of  Yucca  Mountain  in  Nevada.  Although  DOE's  earlier  plans  were 
to  submit  the  license  and  the  application  in  December  2004,  it  has  been  delayed.  That  is  going 
to  be  ten  years  now.  I  don't  think  this  should  be  debated  any  longer.  In  all  fairness  to  our 
current  generation,  and  future  generations,  let's  get  this  right,  and  let's  get  the  attention  of  the 
industry  by  having  a  moratorium  on  these  licensing  until  the  waste  is  removed,  and  disposed, 
properly  long-term,  with  a  financing  plan  in  place.  (0007-11-14  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Comment:  The  other  area  that  I  think  the  EIS  process  is  significantly  deficient  is  in  looking  at 
the  current  issues  of  waste  storage,  removal  and  disposal.  There  is  a  chapter  6,  here,  for  fuel 
cycle  transportation,  decommissioning.  I  don't  see  any  description,  up  front,  other  than 
transportation  of  radioactive  material.  (0007-11-4  [Spencer,  Scott])

Comment:  What  are  we  doing  in  terms  of  the  storage  issues,  the  disposal  issue?  And  I  would 
submit  that  even  this  summary  of  the  nuclear  power  plant  licensing  process  is  significantly 
deficient,  because  there  is  no  detailed  discussion  about  the  dangers  of  the  on-site  waste 
storage,  and  the  ultimate  fact  that  we  have  not  solved  the  long-term  waste  disposal.  (0007-11-5 
[Spencer,  Scott]) 

Comment:  In  terms  of  job  opportunities  I  think  the  unions  have  made  it  very  clear,  it  is  quite 
remarkable  the  job  opportunities  [for  a  new  nuclear  plant].  But  there  is,  also,  job  opportunities  in 
getting  a  waste  disposal  solution  in  place.  (0007-11-6  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Comment:  I  want  to  say  that  in  terms  of  nuclear  waste  removal  and  storage,  I  brought  this 
issue  up  when  I  was  in  high  school,  back  in  the  70s,  at  a  hearing  on  Salem,  over  in  New 
Jersey.  And  I  will  never  forget,  it  was  my  first  experience  speaking  publicly,  and  I  was  berated 
by,  I  don't  know,  whether  it  was  someone  from  the  NRC  or  an  official.  But  they  questioned  me, 
what  is  my  knowledge  of  nuclear  power?  And  I  simply  brought  up  that  why  would  we  allow  this 
plant  to  open,  when  we  have  no  waste  disposal  solution  in  sight.  We  would  not  allow  a 
suburban  development  to  open  without  a  way  for  the  sewage  and  the  trash  removal  to  take 
place.  I  used  that  as  an  example.  And  they  assured  me,  back  in  the  70s,  that  this  solution  was 
well  understood  by  the  engineers,  and  we  would  have  a  solution  by  the  end  of  the  century. 

Well,  we  are  already  in  the  next  century,  and  now  we  are  talking  about  expanding  nuclear 
power.  (0007-11-8  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Comment:  I  really  believe  that  we  should  not  have  a  double  standard  here.  When  we  require 
hotels,  factories,  retail  establishments,  restaurants,  office  complexes,  housing  developments,  to 
all  have  a  waste  disposal  system  in  place,  before  they  are  permitted,  we  should  not  continue  to 
kick  this  problem  down  the  road  for  nuclear  power.  (0007-11-9  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Comment:  I  actually  believe  you  should  be  required  to  model  for  sea  level  rise,  based  on  the 
half-life  of  the  50  years  of  radioactive  waste  you  are  storing  on  that  site,  with  no  solution  in  site, 
of  how  we  are  going  to  deal  with  it.  If  you  get  Yucca  Mountain,  or  someplace  else,  we  can 
revisit  that.  And  then  you  can  deal  with  the  environmental  justice  issues  out  there,  which  I  think 
are  part  of  it.  (0007-2-7  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  And  with  the  processes  of  global  warming  occurring,  and  global  flooding,  and  all  of 
the  problems  of  the  waste  storage,  which  will  be  around  for  1 00,000  years,  if  you  can  supply 
electricity  to  it,  to  make  it  safe,  then  maybe.  But  you  are  not.  You  have  totally  unproven  that 
you  can  even  store  nuclear  waste.  (0007-3-14  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  The  nuclear  waste  is  already  being  used  in  wars  as  depleted  uranium.  If  you  look 
at  statistics,  if  you  look  at  the  images,  you  will  see  how  horrible  this  waste  is.  You  will  see  the 
horrible  product  of  this.  (0007-4-2  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Comment:  This  power  plant,  across  the  river,  has  every  bit  of  nuclear  waste,  from  the  time  that 
it  began  to  operate.  (0007-4-5  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Comment:  So  are  you  going  to  get  all  of  the  waste  out  that  has  ever  been  generated  now,  and 
will  be  generated  in  the  future,  before  2100,  out  of  the  Salem  Hope  Creek  complex  by  2100?

Because  otherwise  I  don't  understand  how  you  can  only  use  that  1.5  meters  projection  [for  sea- 
level  rise].  Of  course,  that  doesn't  include  storm  surge,  and  track  events  like  storms.  (0007-5-7 
[Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  Nuclear  power  is  one  of  the  few  fuel  sources  that  we  have.  And  when  people  sit 
there  and  say  we  don't  have  a  way  of  disposing  of  waste,  well  I  hate  to  tell  you,  you  are  wrong. 

It  has  been  around  for  a  long  time.  And  the  only  question  is  do  we  have  the  political  will  to  do 
it?  (0008-10-2  [Deschere.  Mark]) 

Comment:  Nuclear  waste  remains  a  huge,  huge  problem.  Since  the  inception  of  using  nuclear 
power  this  has  continued  to  be  a  problem,  and  it  has  never  been  addressed.  I  haven't  seen  it 
addressed  here.  It  is  my  understanding  that  all  the  nuclear  waste  ever  generated  at  the  Salem 
Hope  Creek  facility  is  stored  at  that  facility,  which  is  right  on  our  Delaware  River,  which  is 
extremely  concerning.  Particularly  given  that  we  would  like  to  add  another  reactor  which  would, 
presumably,  store  all  its  waste  at  that  same  location,  which  is  on  an  artificial  island,  again,  very 
vulnerable  to  sea  level  rise.  (0008-4-8  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  And  they  [the  National  Academies  of  Science/National  Research  Council]  do  have 
a  voluminous,  several  books,  out  on  the  problems  of  disposal  of  used  and  spent  nuclear 
materials  and  nuclear  waste.  And  that  problem  has  not  been  solved.  This  is,  probably,  the  only 
industry,  or  the  only  construction  project  I  can  think  of,  for  a  major  industry,  that  we  are  looking 
at  moving  ahead,  and  continuing  to  approve,  who  do  not  have  any  idea  yet,  or  any  approved 
way,  to  deal  with  their  waste  stream.  We  have  almost  50  years  of  nuclear  waste  accumulating 
along  the  Delaware  River.  We  do  not  have  a  clear  vision  of  what  to  do  with  that  waste.  (0008-8- 
2  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  I  know  that  after  the  meeting,  earlier,  I  spoke  with  some  of  the  consultants,  and 
staff,  for  the  project.  And  they  explained  to  me  that  [nuclear  waste]  is  not  a  technical  problem,  it 
is  a  political  problem.  That  may  be  true  but  I  think  you  need  to  solve  the  problem  before  we 
continue  to  build  more  nuclear  power.  I  actually  believe,  until  we  solve  that  problem,  we  need  to 
put  a  moratorium  on  nuclear  power,  because  this  is  serious  stuff,  to  keep  building  up  and 
stockpiling  and,  particularly,  stockpiling  it  along  a  water  body  where,  if  it  does  have  a  problem,  it 
can  spread  very  quickly,  and  move  through  the  water  stream  and  be  very,  very  problematic. 
(0008-8-3  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  Building  of  a  new  plant  should  be  off  the  drawing  board  until  the  storage  of  the 
plants  used  control  rods  is  resolved.  It  is  just  ridiculous  to  even  consider  the  site  as  a  storage 
area  for  all  this  radioactive  material.  (0011-7  [Keating,  Thomas]) 

Comment:  [Flooding  and  sea  level  rise]  should  be  of  great  concern,  especially  with  regard  to 
the  possible  on-site  storage  of  nuclear  waste.  (0013-2  [Oppelt,  John]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  6-16;  Section  No.  6.1.6;  Line  No.  37-39;  Strike  the  sentence  stating  that 
the  NRC  will  not  issue  an  ESP  until  the  court's  remand  of  the  Waste  Confidence  Rule  is 
appropriately  addressed.  That  result  is  not  required  as  a  matter  of  law.  While  the  NRC  may 
take  such  action  as  a  matter  of  discretion,  there  is  no  reason  to  include  such  a  statement  in  the

EIS.  Additionally,  the  Commission  has  now  issued  an  order  (CLI-1 4-08)  lifting  the  previous 
suspension  of  final  licensing  actions.  (0015-4-1  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  6-17;  Section  No.  6.1.6;  Line  No.  5;  For  the  reason  discussed  in  the 
previous  comment,  change  the  word  "required"  to  "included".  (0015-4-2  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  6-17;  Section  No.  6.1.6;  Line  No.  6-8;  For  the  reason  discussed  in  the 
comment  related  to  page  6-16,  lines  3739,  delete  this  sentence  since  it  is  unnecessary.  (0015-4- 
3  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  Nos.  6-16  to  6-7;  Section  No.  6.1.6;  These  pages  discuss  the  recent 
developments  related  to  the  environmental  impacts  of  spent  fuel  storage  following  operation, 
commonly  referred  to  as  "waste  confidence"  issues.  The  discussion,  however,  ends  with  the 
September  2013  proposed  rule  and  the  Commission's  abeyance  on  final  reactor  licensing 
decisions  until  these  issues  are  resolved.  There  have  been  subsequent  developments 
immediately  preceding  and  following  publication  of  the  DEIS  that  should  be  addressed  in  the 
FEIS.  Specifically,  the  NRC  staff  sent  the  draft  final  rule  on  continued  storage  of  spent  fuel  after 
operation  to  the  Commission  in  SECY-14-0072  for  approval,  and  that  final  rule  was  approved  by 
the  Commission  for  publication  with  relatively  minor  revisions  in  the  August  26,  2014  Staff 
Requirements  Memorandum  for  SECY-14-0072.  The  Commission  also  issued  Memorandum 
and  Order  CLI-14-08  that  lifted  the  abeyance  on  final  reactor  licensing  decisions  as  of  the 
effective  date  of  the  final  rule.  The  final  rule  was  published  on  September  19,  2014,  and 
effective  on  October  20,  2014.  The  FEIS  should  discuss  these  developments,  but  no  further 
analysis  should  be  necessary  because  the  revised  1 0  CFR  51 .23  states  that  the  environmental 
impacts  of  continued  storage  have  been  generically  and  conclusively  determined  in  NUREG- 
2157,  and  the  impact  determinations  in  NUREG-2157  shall  be  deemed  incorporated  into 
environmental  impact  statements.  (0015-4-4  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  There  are  three  main  concerns  that  I  have  about  your  proposal.  They  are  waste 
disposal;  fish  and  marine  creatures  kills;  and  safety.  Your  waste  disposal  proposal  seems  to  be 
more  of  the  same.  It  makes  little  sense.  (0019-3  [Passmore,  Wills]) 

Comment:  It  is  possible  that  the  new  proposed  site  may  not  be  decommissioned  until  2200. 
Long  term  planning  must  address  potential  complications  as  a  result  sea  level  rise  which  may 
compromise  spent  fuel  storage  facilities.  (0023-2-11  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Comment:  The  radioactive  waste  keeps  piling  up  in  temporary  storage  facilities.  No  one  has 
figured  out  how  to  deal  with  this  waste.  How  is  this  acceptable?  (0024-2  [Doyle,  Kathy]) 

Comment:  Disposal  of  waste  -  there  is  no  permanent  facility  or  plan.  Current  on-site  storage  is 
a  danger  to  the  local  environment  and  surrounding  communities,  across  the  Delaware  River  and 
along  the  Eastern  seaboard-including  Philadelphia  and  NYC,  dense  population  centers.  (0032- 
8  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  The  solution  to  the  safe  storage  of  nuclear  waste  has  been  just  around  the  corner 
since  1970.  We  are  no  closer  now.  One  of  the  main  dangers  at  the  Fukushima  disaster 
involved  the  waste  stored  on  site.  I  could  not  build  a  house  without  having  a  plan  to  deal  with 


NUREG-2168

the  waste  I  generate.  How  is  the  nuclear  industry  exempt  from  this  requirement?  I  suggest  a 
moratorium  on  new  plants  if  not  the  shutting  down  of  existing  sites.  (0046-1  [Campion,  George]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  concerns  about  certain  environmental  impacts  of  the 
uranium  fuel  cycle,  including  the  management  of  radioactive  waste.  Section  6. 1  of  the  EIS 
addresses  these  topics.  The  analysis  in  Section  6. 7  is  based  on  10  CFR  51.51(a),  Table  S-3, 
Table  of  Uranium  Fuel  Cycle  Environmental  Data. 

Section  6.1.6  has  been  revised  to  incorporate  the  recently  issued  final  rulemaking  related  to 
continued  storage  of  spent  nuclear  fuel.  On  August  26,  2014,  the  Commission  issued  a  revised 
rule  at  10  CFR  5 1.23  and  associated  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  Continued 
Storage  of  Spent  Nuclear  Fuel  (NUREG-2157).  The  revised  rule  adopts  the  generic  impact 
determinations  made  in  NU REG-21 57  and  codifies  the  NRC's  generic  determinations  regarding 
the  environmental  impacts  of  continued  storage  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  beyond  a  reactor's 
operating  license.  The  NRC  staff  has  considered,  in  Section  6.1.6,  the  incorporation  of  the 
generic  impacts  of  continued  storage  in  the  context  of  the  PS  EG  environmental  review.  As 
directed  by  10  CFR  5 1.23(b),  the  impacts  assessed  in  NUREG-2157  are  deemed  incorporated 
into  this  EIS. 

Several  of  the  comments  express  concern  regarding  climate  change  impacts,  such  as  sea -level 
rise,  on  continued  storage  of  spent  fuel  onsite.  NUREG-2157  addresses  potential  climate 
change  impacts  on  continued  storage  of  spent  fuel  in  Section  4. 18.  This  section  identifies 
possible  corrective  actions  for  radioactive  waste  and  spent  fuel  storage  facilities  that  could  be 
threatened  by  rising  sea  level.  In  the  event  of  climate  change-induced  sea-level  rise,  the  NRC 
would  require  licensees  to  implement  corrective  actions  to  identify  and  correct  conditions 
adverse  to  safety.  The  NRC  requires  licensees  to  take  these  corrective  actions  regardless  of 
the  mechanism  creating  the  condition  adverse  to  safety.  As  directed  by  10  CFR  51 .23(b),  the 
impacts  assessed  in  NU  REG-21 57  are  deemed  incorporated  into  this  EIS. 

Comment:  And  where  does  all  the  uranium  come  from,  by  the  way?  Last  time  I  checked  none 
of  it  comes  from  the  United  States,  or  very  little.  So  anybody  ever  live  through  the  Arab 
embargo  with  oil?  Have  we  given  that  consideration,  and  the  reliability  of  the  uranium?  (0006-4-7 
[Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  But  if  you  look  at  the  whole  life  cycle  of  how  is  the  uranium  mined,  where  is  it 
coming  from?  A  lot  of  it  is  coming  from,  I  believe,  it  is  Navajo  land,  Native  American  land.  It  has 
a  lot  of  negative  effects  on  their  land,  there  is  radioactivity  in  the  soil.  There  is  radioactivity  in 
the  water.  They  have  health  effects.  That  is  an  environmental  justice  impact.  (0007-13-5 
[Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  Total  energy  costs  of  nuclear  energy  production  must  include  uranium  mining, 
effects  of  mining  on  land/water,  tribal  territories  and  populations-this  is  an  environmental  justice 
and  health  issue  as  well.  (0032-6  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  The  nuclear  chain  is  toxic  and  energy  intensive  from  start  to  finish.  Abandoned 
mines  (near  schools)  in  South  Dakota  are  hotter  than  the  evacuation  zone  of  Chernobyl.  We 
thought  the  zone  would  support  wildlife,  but  new  generations  are  weakened.  Certainly  the  bio

toxic  products  of  generation  could  be  considered  as  an  environmental  impact.  (0047-4  [Campion, 
Mary]) 

Response:  Section  6. 1  of  the  EIS  addresses  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  uranium  fuel 
cycle,  including  the  supply  of  uranium  used  as  fuel.  The  analysis  in  Section  6. 1  is  based  on 
10  CFR  51 .51  (a),  Table  S-3,  Table  of  Uranium  Fuel  Cycle  Environmental  Data.  Sources  of 
uranium  are  discussed  in  Section  6. 1  of  the  FIS;  as  discussed  there,  there  is  renewed  interest  in 
uranium  recovery  in  the  United  States.  The  environmental  impact  of  uranium  recovery  is 
addressed  in  Table  S-3.  An  environmental  review  is  performed  in  response  to  an  application 
for  a  uranium  recovery  operation.  These  reviews  would  address  the  effects  of  uranium  recovery 
on  land  and  water,  health,  and  environmental justice.  Specific  issues  associated  with  individual 
uranium  recovery  operations  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  FIS,  and  no  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  We  are,  then,  left  with  the  nuclear  industry.  While  there  is  the  issue  of  waste  which, 

I  hope,  the  Government  and  the  NRC  can  begin  to  reprocess,  and  recycle  back  to  fuel,  I  have 
come  to  tour  plants,  and  have  had  hours  of  discussions  with  employees  and  neighbors.  (0004- 
14-1  [Moscovici,  Dan]) 

Comment:  Finally  I  would  be  remiss  if  I  didn't  add  a  little  interjection,  here,  on  this  overarching 
issue.  I  would  like  to  add  that  our  New  Jersey  Congressional  Delegation,  all  of  Congress,  they 
need  to  address  the  recycling  of  nuclear  fuel.  Right  now  other  countries  are  allowed  to  do  this. 
We  are  behind  the  eight  ball.  We  must  have  that  ability  to  do  this,  here  in  the  United  States. 

The  federal  government  must  have  a  stable  public  policy  supporting  recycling  that  enables 
companies  to  make  long  term  capital  intensive  investments.  (0004-2-13  [Egenton,  Michael]) 

Response:  As  stated  in  Section  6. 1  of  the  EIS,  assessment  of  environmental  impacts  of  the 
fuel  cycle  as  related  to  the  operation  of  new  nuclear  units  at  the  PS  EG  Site  is  based  on  the 
values  given  in  Table  S-3.  In  developing  Table  S-3,  the  NRC  staff  considered  impacts  from 
both  fuel  cycles  (no-recycle  and  uranium-only).  The  impacts  presented  in  Table  S-3  are 
maximized  for  both  of  the  fuel  cycles ;  that  is,  the  identified  environmental  impacts  are  based  on 
the  cycle  that  results  in  the  greater  impact.  The  current  national  policy,  as  found  in  the  Nuclear 
Waste  Policy  Act  (42  USC  10101  et  seq.),  mandates  that  high-level  and  transuranic  wastes  be 
buried  at  a  deep  geologic  repository.  While  Federal  policy  no  longer  prohibits  reprocessing  and 
recycling,  additional  governmental  and  commercial  efforts  would  be  needed  before  commercial 
reprocessing  and  recycling  of  spent  fuel  from  U.  S.  nuclear  power  reactors  would  occur.  Thus, 
this  assessment  is  based  upon  the  "no- recycle"  option  at  this  time.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Page  No.  6-1 0;  Section  No.  6.1.3;  Line  No.  10-11;  The  statement  that  750,000  MT 
of  C02  is  less  than  3%  of  New  Jersey's  annual  emissions  is  much  too  high,  given  the  statement 
on  page  7-37  of  the  DEIS  that  New  Jersey's  annual  emissions  are  143  million  MT  of  C02. 
(0015-3-20  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  text  in  Section  6.1.3  has  been  changed  to  read  "less  than  1  percent  of  New 
Jersey's  annual  emissions. "

E.2.21  Comments  Concerning  Transportation 

Comment:  Page  No.  6-26;  Section  No.  6.2.1. 1;  Line  No.  14-16;  The  DEIS  states:  "This  value 
slightly  exceeds  the  2-rem/year  DOE  administrative  control  level  for  individual  doses  (DOE 
2005-TN1235)  and  is  about  40  percent  of  the  5-rem/year  NRC  occupational  dose  limit  (see  10 
CFR  20-TN283)."  This  sentence  should  be  deleted.  The  sentence  inappropriately  compares 
individual  dose  limits  to  cumulative  doses  to  all  inspectors.  (0015-4-6  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  individual  dose  to  vehicle  inspectors  presented  in  Section  6.2. 7.7  of  the  EIS  is 
based  on  an  individual  inspecting  149  shipments  of  unirradiated  fuel,  spent  fuel,  and  radioactive 
waste  per  year,  and  is  the  cumulative  dose  over  all  inspections  in  a  year  but  is  not  the 
cumulative  dose  to  all  inspectors.  No  change  was  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  State  of  Delaware  has  laws  that  prohibit  the  transport,  storage,  disposal  or 
reprocessing  of  spent  nuclear  fuel  in  the  State.  Should  future  national  policy  allow  for  the 
relocation  of  spent  fuel  from  the  PSEG  site  to  a  federal  repository,  the  route  of  transfer  may  be 
affected  by  Delaware  law.  See  the  Delaware  Authority  on  Radiation  Protection  and  the 
Delaware  Code  Title  1 6  Chapter  74  for  more  information.  The  text  of  this  regulation  is  available 
here:  http://delcode.delaware.gov/title16/c074/index.shtml.  (0023-2-10  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Response:  Should  future  national  policy  allow  for  the  relocation  of  spent  fuel  from  the  PSEG 
Site  to  a  Federal  repository,  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  (DOT)  regulations  allow  States 
to  designate  preferred  routes  for  radioactive  material  shipments,  which  ensures  routes  for  spent 
fuel  transportation  avoid  locations  where  unsafe  conditions  of  travel  could  be  encountered.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  6-19;  Section  No.  6.2;  Line  No.  37-38;  The  DEIS  states:  "However,  the 
ER  does  not  present  the  transportation  impacts  for  the  alternative  sites  evaluated  in  this  EIS." 
This  statement  is  inaccurate.  In  response  to  RAI  Env-12,  Question  6.0-4,  PSEG  revised  the  ER 
to  address  the  transportation  impacts  from  the  alternative  sites.  (0015-4-5  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  In  Sections  5. 7.2.2. 1,  5. 7. 2. 2. 2,  and  5. 7. 2. 2. 2  of  the  PSEG  ER,  the  ER  states  that 
the  difference  in  incident-free  consequences  due  to  transportation  of  unirradiated  fuel,  irradiated 
fuel,  and  radwaste  to  the  alternative  sites  is  not  significant  due  to  the  small  differences  in 
mileage  between  the  alternative  sites  and  the  assumed  fabrication  facility,  assumed  repository, 
and  assumed  radwaste  repository,  respectively.  In  addition,  the  ER  states  that  an  evaluation  of 
the  environmental  impact  due  to  transportation  of  unirradiated  fuel,  irradiated  fuel,  and  radwaste 
at  alternative  sites  7- 1,  7-2,  7-3,  and  4-  7  indicates  that  the  alternative  sites  are  not  obviously 
superior  to  the  PSEG  Site  (Sections  5. 7.2.4  and  7.4.3).  However,  the  ER  does  not  present  the 
transportation  impacts  associated  with  these  alternative  sites  as  are  presented  in  Section  6.2  of 
the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

E.2.22  Comments  Concerning  Decommissioning 

Comment:  The  EIS  fails  to  intelligently  discuss,  to  discuss  these  aspects,  nor  the  incredible 
costs  that  all  of  the  PSEG  customers,  like  myself,  will  pay  for  this  plant,  and  its 
decommissioning  over  time.  (0006-4-8  [Brook,  David]) 


November  2015

Appendix  E 


Comment:  But  the  continuation  of  nuclear  energy,  over  there  at  Salem,  with  the  behemoths 
that  they  have  there  now,  that  they  need  to  shut  down,  and  decommission,  and  don't  have  the 
money  for,  because  they  are  not  putting  the  money  for  the  decommissioning  costs.  (0008*9-7 
[August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  A  nuclear  power  plant  decommissioning  analysis  with  associated  costs  should  be 
included  in  the  DEIS.  The  DEIS  very  briefly  discusses  decommissioning  of  a  future  nuclear 
power  plant  in  Sections  6.3  and  7.1 1 .3.  NRC  discusses  the  impacts  and  concludes  they  are 
"small."  The  level  of  discussion  and  consideration  of  the  costs  of  decommissioning  is  seriously 
lacking.  They  will  not  be  "small."  (0020-4-10  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  NRC  should  have  provided  past  experiences  and  information  on  prior  nuclear 
power  plant  decommissioning  in  order  to  present  information  for  the  public  to  consider  as  to  the 
costs,  the  risks,  and  the  wisdom  of  building  a  new  nuclear  reactor.  (0020-4-12  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Response:  These  comments  deal  with  decommissioning.  The  PS  EG  application  is  for  an 
ESP,  and  there  are  variations  with  how  certain  aspects  of  the  environmental  review  are 
addressed  for  an  ESP  versus  a  COL  application.  For  an  ESP,  applicants  are  not  required  to 
submit  information  regarding  the  process  of  decommissioning  (e.g.,  the  method  chosen  for 
decommissioning,  the  schedule,  or  any  other  aspect  of  planning  for  decommissioning). 

However,  PS  EG  did  provide  information  on  the  environmental  impacts  of  decommissioning  in 
Section  5.9  of  its  ER— submitted  as  part  of  its  application.  The  environmental  impacts  of 
decommissioning  are  based  on  NUREG-0586,  Supplement  7.  The  GEIS  incorporates 
experience  and  information  from  earlier  nuclear  power  plant  decommissioning  activities.  The 
NRC  staff's  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  decommissioning  presented  in  the  GEIS 
identifies  a  range  of  impacts  for  each  environmental  issue  for  a  range  of  different  reactor 
designs,  and  the  staff  has  no  reason  to  believe  that  the  impacts  discussed  in  the  GEIS  are  not 
bounding  for  reactors  deployed  after  2002. 

If  PSEG  applies  for  a  license  to  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  there  is  a 
requirement  to  provide  a  report  containing  a  certification  that  financial  assurance  for  radiological 
decommissioning  would  be  provided  per  10  CFR  50.33(k).  As  part  of  its  review  of  a  license 
application,  NRC  would  review  the  financial  assurance  documentation  to  assure  that  all 
applicable  requirements  are  met. 

No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

E.2.25  Comments  Concerning  Cumulative  Impacts 

Comment:  And  I  think  the  transport,  the  mining,  the  transport,  all  the  processing  of  the  fuel,  is 
also  an  impact  that  needs  to  be  considered  as  one  of  the  cumulative  impacts.  (0007-13-7 
[Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff  discusses  the  uranium  fuel  cycle,  including  mining,  processing,  and 
transporting,  in  Sections  6. 1  through  6.3  of  the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  this  comment.

Comment:  Page  No.  7-1;  Section  No.  7.0;  Line  No.  2-3;  This  sentence  states  that  NEPA 
requires  consideration  of  cumulative  impacts.  However,  NEPA  does  not  mention  cumulative 
impacts.  Therefore,  this  sentence  should  be  revised  to  state  that  the  CEQ  regulations  under 
NEPA  require  consideration  of  cumulative  impacts.  (0015-4-7  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  text  in  EIS  Section  7.0  has  been  revised  to  reflect  that  NRC  regulations 
implementing  NEPA  require  the  consideration  of  cumulative  impacts. 

E.2.26  Comments  Concerning  the  Need  for  Power 

Comment:  At  the  May  6th,  and  November  20th,  2010  public  meetings  that  the  NRC  held  on 
this  project,  I  commented  on  the  importance  on  providing  additional  electrical  generation 
capacity  to  meet  the  energy  needs  of  New  Jersey  residents  and  businesses.  Those  comments 
are  still  applicable,  especially  the  need  to  provide  baseload  generating  capacity,  which  another 
speaker  talked  about,  supplemented  by  renewable  energy  resources,  such  as  wind  and  solar,  in 
New  Jersey.  (0004-16-3  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  The  demand  for  electric  continues  to  increase.  Everything  is  plugged  in,  these 
days,  and  we  live  in  a  24-7  world.  For  that  we  need  baseload  power.  The  new  nuclear  plant 
could  provide  up  to  28  percent  of  the  projected  increase  in  baseload  demand.  (0004-18-3 
[Hufsey,  Moe]) 

Comment:  Back  in  2010,  in  May,  November,  in  previous  meetings  on  this  matter,  we  provided 
testimony  at  that  time.  In  fact,  we  need  additional  generating  capacity  to  meet  the  energy  needs 
of  New  Jersey  residents  and  businesses.  Those  comments  are  still  applicable  today,  especially 
in  the  need  to  provide  baseloading  generation,  which  can  be  supplemented  by  renewable 
energy,  such  as  wind  and  solar.  (0007-16-3  [Palmer,  Dennis]) 

Comment:  Demand  for  electricity  continued  increase,  everything  is  plugged  in  these  days. 

And  we  live  in  a  24-7  world.  For  that  we  need  baseload  power.  The  new  nuclear  plant  will 
provide  up  to  28  percent  of  the  projected  increase  in  baseload  demand.  (0007-8-4  [Spiese, 

Steve]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  support  for  the  baseload  power  that  would  be  generated 
by  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  but  they  provide  no  new  information  for  additional 
analysis.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  We  are  given  a  figure  as  to  how  much  electricity  will  be  needed  in  the  future,  but  I 
don't  know  where  that  figure  comes  from.  And  does  that  seriously  consider  real  conservation 
efforts?  So  I  just  would  like  to  put  that  out  there,  also.  (0007-13-3  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  Also,  the  baseload  model  that  we  have  been  having,  for  the  last  200  years,  is  going 
by  the  way  of  the  Tin  Lizzy.  I'm  a  solar  producer.  I  will  be  able  to  supply  my  own  electricity,  at 
my  own  house,  with  battery,  current  battery  technology,  and  conservation.  (0007-3-12  [August, 
Bernard]) 

Comment:  In  addition,  the  NRC  and  the  applicant  have  not  demonstrated  a  need  for  this 
project.  (0020-1-6  [van  Rossum,  Maya])

NUREG-21 68 


Appendix  E 


Comment:  The  DEIS  fails  to  identify  a  real  need  for  power,  and  thus  there  is  no  need  for  this 
nuclear  power  plant.  Section  8.0  of  the  DEIS  performs  an  analysis  of  whether  there  is  sufficient 
baseload  available  or  whether  the  baseload  from  this  plant  is  needed  by  the  year  2023.  The 
analysis  area  is  New  Jersey.  There  is  no  stated  real  need  for  this  plant  since  there  is  already 
capacity  to  produce  this  electricity  and  that  any  additional  needs  could  readily  be  met  with  less 
expensive,  smaller  decentralized  sustainable  generation.  Nowhere  in  this  DEIS  does  NRC 
identify  a  shortage  of  available  baseload  for  the  PSEG  service  area,  and  nowhere  in  any 
analysis  does  it  require  NRC  to  only  consider  power  generation  that  only  comes  from  within  the 
PSEG  service  area.  Electricity  is  freely  exchanged  between  all  providers  and  that  is  specifically 
why  the  PJM  network  has  been  successful  and  cost  efficient  at  delivering  reliable  baseload  to 
the  entire  region.  (0020-5-2  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  Based  upon  the  PSEG's  own  predictions,  its  service  area  might  need  something 
under  1  MW  of  additional  supply  by  2023,  and  this  need  could  readily  be  supplied  by  less 
expensive  renewable  power.  It  appears  that  the  only  justification  presented  for  this  new  plant  in 
the  DEIS  is  this  plant  would  replace  other  baseload  already  available  to  New  Jersey.  DRN  does 
not  believe  that  this  analysis  demonstrates  a  legitimate  need  for  a  power  plant  that  will  cause 
irreparable  harm  to  the  environment  and  might  cost  upwards  of  $10  billion  or  more  by  the  time  it 
is  actually  completed.  (0020-5-3  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  We  must  question  why  there  is  a  push  to  build  Salem  4  at  this  time.  Electricity 
demand  is  stable  and  energy  efficiency  is  constantly  improving.  In  2010  New  Jersey  passed 
landmark  legislation,  signed  by  Governor  Christie,  committing  the  state  to  building  1,100  Mega 
Watts  of  offshore  wind  generation  by  2020.  This  suggests  a  real  commitment  to  renewable 
energy,  but  approval  of  Salem  4  may  make  it  less  likely  that  this  commitment  is  honored. 
(0022-12  [Butch,  Kerry  Margaret]  [King,  Charlotte]  [Pryde,  Coralie]) 

Comment:  The  Population  growth  estimate,  upon  which  the  asserted  need  for  future  additional 
power  is  based,  is  only  a  planning  projection  which  may  not  be  fulfilled.  (0032-4  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Response:  The  NRC  staff's  methodology  and  sources  for  its  need  for  power  determination  can 
be  found  in  Chapter  8  of  the  EIS.  These  comments  provide  no  new  information  for  additional 
analysis.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  [T]he  baseload  power  load,  for  this  area,  could  be  easily  met  by  alternative 
energies.  Reports  from  the  National  Energy  Research  Laboratory  has  shown  that  by  2030,  if 
we  go  with  wind,  solar,  and  hydroelectric,  and  conservation  measures,  we  would  not  have  to  be 
building  any  power  plants,  and  we  could  be  like  Germany,  shutting  the  present  ones  down. 
(0007-3-9  [August,  Bernard]) 

Response:  in  Section  9.2  of  the  EIS,  the  NRC  staff  presented  an  assessment  of  the  viability  of 
renewable  energy  sources  and  conservation  measures  as  an  alternative  to  the  postulated 
nuclear  plant.  This  assessment  concluded  that  reliance  on  renewable  energy  sources  and 
conservation  is  not  a  viable  alternative  to  a  baseload  generating  unit.  The  comment  did  not 
provide  new  information  and  will  not  be  evaluated  further.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as 
a  result  of  this  comment.

Comment:  Page  No.  8-1;  Section  No.  8.0;  A  paragraph  should  be  added  to  Section  8.0  to  state 
that  PSEG's  Need  for  Power  analysis  is  based  on  baseload  power  forecasts,  while  the  NRC 
Need  for  Power  analysis  evaluated  peak  load  forecasts.  A  summary  sentence  should  conclude 
that  the  two  analyses  are  consistent  with  each  other.  (0015-4-15  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  This  comment  identifies  a  deficiency  in  the  EIS.  Section  8.0  has  been  revised  in 
response  to  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-1 ;  Section  No.  8.0;  Line  No.  24-26;  These  lines  say  that  forecasts  "are 
provided  through  2024,  3  years  after  the  planned  commercial  operation  date  of  2021".  In  fact, 
however,  Chapter  8  presents  forecasts  only  through  2023,  which  is  2  years  after  the  planned 
commercial  operation  date.  (0015-4-16  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-1;  Section  No.  8.0;  Line  No.  40-41;  This  sentence  is  confusing  because 
it  incorrectly  implies  that  an  API  000  has  a  larger  electrical  output  than  the  other  three  designs. 
The  first  clause  of  this  sentence  should  be  rewritten  to  state:  "Because  a  two-unit  Advanced 
Passive  1000  plant  has  a  larger  net  electrical  output  at  2,200  MW(e)  than  a  single  unit  of  any  of

Comment:  Page  No.  8-2;  Section  No.  8.0;  Line  No.  4-19;  The  summary  of  results  does  not 
address  the  need  for  power.  It  only  addresses  the  identification  of  the  market  area  (RSA)  as 
NJ,  high  power  rates  in  NJ,  and  the  alignment  with  the  NJ  Energy  Master  Plan.  (0015-4-19 
[Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-20;  Section  No.  8.3;  Line  No.  22-23;  For  clarity,  the  Long-Term 
Capacity  Agreement  Pilot  Program  is  currently  under  litigation  and  of  the  three  proposed 
combined  cycle  gas-fired  generating  projects  that  comprise  the  1 ,949  MW  of  capacity,  only  may 
be  moving  forward  independent  of  the  program.  (0015-5-10  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-20;  Section  No.  8.3;  Table  8-6;  Table  8-6  shows  NJ  2014  installed 
capacity  of  20,808  MW,  but  Lines  17  and  29  say  that  20,808  MW  is  the  2012  capacity  in  NJ.  It 
is  very  unlikely  that  the  2012  and  2014  numbers  should  be  the  same.  ER  Table  8.3-3  shows 
that  the  2012-13  NJ  capacity  is  18,126  MW.  (0015-5-11  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-22;  Section  No.  8.5;  Line  No.  8-9;  These  lines  say  that  the  PSEG  plant 
would  alleviate  "about  a  third  of  the  gap  between  forecast  demand  and  forecast  supply".  In  fact, 
the  DEIS  analysis  shows  that  the  PSEG  plant  would  alleviate  about  half  of  the  gap.  (0015-5-12 
[Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-22;  Section  No.  8.5;  Line  No.  11-13;  These  lines  say  that  the  DEIS 
analysis  shows  a  need  for  additional  capacity  "3  years  after  the  commencement  of  full 
operations  (2023)",  but  the  analysis  actually  ends  2  years  after  the  commencement  of  full 
operations.  (0015-5-13  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-12;  Section  No.  8.2;  Line  No.  11;  For  clarity,  the  PJM  load  forecast  only 
provides  forecasts  of  peak  load  and  energy  demand.  It  does  not  forecast  baseload  energy  as 
implied  in  this  sentence.  (0015-5-3  [Mallon,  James])

Response:  These  comments  deal  with  editorial  corrections  to  the  EIS,  and  the  EIS  has  been 
revised  in  response  to  each  individual  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-1;  Section  No.  8.0;  Line  No.  28;  For  clarity,  reword  to  state  "In  2010, 
PSEG  developed  projections  of  the  need  for  baseload  electricity  based  on  PJM  forecasts  of 
electricity  demand  and  information  available  at  that  time."  (0015-4-17  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-3;  Section  No.  8.1.1;  Line  No.  15;  Imported  resources  serve  both 
baseload  and  peak  demand,  therefore,  for  clarity,  reword  to  state  "...rely  on  imported  power  to 
meet  growth  in  electricity  demand".  (0015-4-20  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-4;  Section  No.  8.1.1;  Line  No.  10;  Delete  the  phrase  "only  minimal 
criteria  or ".  That  phrase  makes  no  sense  in  the  context  of  the  sentence.  (0015-5-1  [Mallon, 
James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-12;  Section  No.  8.2;  Line  No.  9;  For  clarity,  the  estimates  of  baseload 
demand  were  initially  developed  by  PSEG  based  on  the  2008  PJM  load  forecast  and  later 
validated  with  a  baseload  demand  estimate  based  on  the  PJM  2012  load  forecast.  (0015-5-2 
[Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-18;  Section  No.  8.3;  Line  No.  4-5;  The  2013  PJM  Load  Forecast  report 
is  identified  as  the  source  for  generation  resource  data,  but  PJM's  Load  Forecast  report  does 
not  address  generation  resources.  (0015-5-7  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  8-19;  Section  No.  8.3;  Line  No.  13-14;  There  are  currently  no  Marcellus 
Shale  natural  gas  fields  in  New  Jersey.  (0015-5-9  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  These  comments  deal  with  editorial  corrections  to  the  EIS ;  however,  upon  detailed 
review  of  each  comment,  the  NRC  staff  has  determined  that  no  revisions  to  the  EIS  are  needed. 
No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments.

E.2.27  Comments  Concerning  the  No-Action  Alternative 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-3;  Section  No.  9.1;  This  section  should  include  a  conclusion.  We 
recommend  the  following  conclusion:  "If  the  ESP  were  not  issued  and  no  additional  measures 
were  implemented  to  generate  power,  then  the  need  for  power  discussed  in  Chapter  8  would 
not  be  met.  Therefore,  the  purpose  and  need  of  this  project  would  not  be  satisfied  if  the  no¬ 
action  alternative  was  chosen  and  the  need  for  power  was  not  met  by  other  means."  (0015-5-15 
[Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  10-22;  Section  No.  10.5;  Line  No.  37;  See  the  comment  on  Section  9.1 
about  adding  a  conclusion  sentence.  Add  the  same  sentence  here.  (0015-7-12  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  These  comments  contain  recommendations  for  revisions  to  the  text  in  the  EIS 
regarding  the  no-action  alternative.  The  language  recommended  in  the  comments  describes 
the  potential  consequences  of  not  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site; 
however,  the  NRC's  no-action  alternative  would  be  to  deny  the  request  for  an  ESP  for  the  site. 
Because  an  ESP  does  not  authorize  the  building  and  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant,  no 
conclusions  can  be  drawn  in  regard  to  not  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site 
under  the  no-action  alternative.  For  these  reasons,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  these  comments. 

E.2.28  Comments  Concerning  Energy  Alternatives 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-7;  Section  No.  9. 2. 1.3;  Line  No.  31-32;  Change  "The  review  team 
concluded  in  Chapter  8  that  there  is  a  justified  need  for  power  in  the  PSEG  ROI...."  to  "The 
review  team  concluded  in  Chapter  8  that  there  is  a  justified  need  for  power  in  the  PSEG  RSA 
which  covers  the  same  area  as  the  ROI...."  (0015-5-16  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-7;  Section  No.  9. 2. 1.3;  Line  No.  33;  For  clarity,  text  should  be  revised  to 
read  "Because  PSEG  Power  only  owns  generating  plants..."  (0015-5-17  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-21;  Section  No.  9. 2. 3.1;  Footnote;  The  DEIS  states  "...  IGCC  plant  in 
Kemper  County,  Mississippi,  ....and  a  planned  commercial  operations  date  of  May  2014."  As  of 
September  15,  2014  the  planned  commercial  operations  date  is  May  2015.  (0015-5-20  [Mallon, 
James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-36;  Section  No.  9.2.4;  Line  No.  18-20;  The  DEIS  states:  "For  example, 
as  a  result  of  New  Jersey's  Long-Term  Capacity  Agreement  Pilot  Program,  contracts  have  been 
awarded  for  the  construction  of  three  natural-gas  combined-cycle  projects  with  a  total  capacity 
of  1,949  MW(e)  (New  Jersey  201  1-TN2115)."  A  federal  judge,  on  October  11, 2013,  concluded 
that  the  L-CAPP  law  was  unconstitutional.  (0015-6-1  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-38;  Section  No.  9.2.4;  Line  No.  20-21 ;  This  sentence  states  that  the 
adverse  socioeconomic  impacts  would  be  SMALL.  That  is  inconsistent  with  Tables  9-3  and  9-4, 
which  classify  the  adverse  socioeconomic  impacts  as  MODERATE.  (0015-6-3  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  These  comments  contain  recommendations  for  revisions  and/or  changes  to  the 
text  in  the  EIS.  In  response  to  these  comments,  the  EIS  has  been  revised  at  the  locations

indicated  in  the  respective  comments ;  however,  the  specific  revisions  that  have  been 
incorporated  into  this  EIS  may  not  exactly  match  the  language  contained  in  the 
recommendations  in  each  comment. 

Comment:  By  the  way,  I  object  to  the  appellation  of  industrial  wind  plants  as  wind  farms. 

When  they  are  referred  to  as  wind  farms  the  misconception  is  of  benign  bucolic  scenes  of  farms 
of  yesteryear,  with  a  small  many  bladed  wind  turbine  mill  standing  nearby.  The  DEIS  should 
refer  to  them  as  industrial  wind  plants.  (0004-12-6  [Eastman,  Alice  (Ajax)]) 

Response:  The  objection  to  the  phrase  "wind  farms"  in  the  comment  is  noted;  however,  this 
phrase  is  an  acceptable  description  of  the  industrial  wind  facilities  that  would  harvest  wind 
energy.  In  addition,  the  phrase  "wind  farms"  is  understood  and  recognized  by  the  general 
public.  Because  this  comment  did  not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the 
environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of 
this  comment. 

Comment:  But  if  we  want,  for  a  long  term,  have  a  viable  society  based  on  an  energy  source, 
while  we  are  waiting  for  the  next  great  hope,  of  which  I  heard  several  of  them  here,  and  having 
worked  in  fuel  cells  in  DuPont,  they  are  a  long,  long  way  off  before  they  become  a  significant 
reliable  source.  (0008-10-1  [Deschere,  Mark]) 

Response:  Section  9.2.2  discusses  sources  of  energy  that  could  be  used  for  new  electric 
power  generation  facilities  and  addresses  the  issue  raised  in  the  comment  regarding  whether 
those  energy  sources  are  viable  for  generating  the  amount  of  baseload  electricity  being 
contemplated  under  the  Proposed  Action.  Note  that  the  discussion  in  Section  9.2  includes  fuel 
cells  (Section  9. 2. 2. 9).  This  comment  did  not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the 
environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action;  hence,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  What  we  are  left,  then,  with  is  coal,  natural  gas,  hydro,  and  nuclear,  to  cover  the 
scale  and  timing  of  our  energy  demand.  We  have  been  moving  away  from  coal  due  to  health 
effects,  and  devastating  impacts,  from  mountain  top  removal.  Natural  gas  has  become  our 
bridge.  However,  living  in  the  lower  Delaware  River  watershed  I'm  really  concerned  for  what  will 
happen  in  the  future  with  fracking.  We  need  water  to  survive,  and  we  may  see  its 
contamination.  I  also  don't  see  a  renaissance  in  large  scale  hydro  in  this  area.  (0004-14-5 
[Moscovici,  Dan]) 

Comment:  At  the  May  6th,  and  November  0th,  2010  public  meetings  that  the  NRC  held  on  this 
project,  I  commented  on  the  importance  on  providing  additional  electrical 
generation  capacity  to  meet  the  energy  needs  of  New  Jersey  residents  and  businesses.  Those 
comments  are  still  applicable,  especially  the  need  to  provide  baseload  generating  capacity, 
which  another  speaker  talked  about,  supplemented  by  renewable  energy  resources,  such  as 
wind  and  solar,  in  New  Jersey.  (0004-16-4  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  We  also  believe  that  the  alternative  energy  options  have  not  been  given  fair  or  due 
consideration.  Truly  sustainable  energy  options,  really,  are  available  here  in  New  Jersey,  here 
in  the  Delaware  River  region,  including  solar  panels,  geothermal,  some  very  interesting  water

technologies.  And  there  is  more  opportunities  coming  out  every  day.  And  we  do  not  believe 
that  they  have  been  given  due  and  fair  consideration,  by  the  NRC  in  the  Environmental  Impact 
Statement  that  has  been  put  forth.  (0004-3-10  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  A  second  category  of  what  can  we  do,  bring  more  renewables  energy  sources  on 
line.  Here  we  like  solar  energy,  wind  energy,  and  bio  fuels.  At  the  time  we  were  discussing 
these  ideas  we  had  only  limited  experience  with  these  techniques  and  technologies. 

Experience,  over  the  past  decades,  tells  us  that  each  of  these  solutions  comes  with  a  cost.  We 
cover  fragile  desert  habitats  with  solar  panels,  while  ignoring  warehouse  rooftops,  and  other 
existing  opportunities  that  have  less  impact.  Wind  energy  leaves  a  construction  and  service 
footprint,  at  the  expense  of  wildlife  habitats.  And  operation  has  serious  impacts  on  the  mortality 
of  migratory  birds,  and  foraging  bats.  Land  growing  bio  fuels  have  very  limited  wildlife  habitat 
value.  (0004-4-1  [Applegate,  Jim]) 

Comment:  The  alternative  analysis,  which  was  discussed  before,  is  terribly  flawed,  and  totally 
skewed  towards  selling  nuclear.  Here  is  a  hint.  You  can't  compare  one  alternative,  at  one  time, 
to  the  plant.  The  plant  is  always  going  to  have  a  higher  baseload.  But  if  you  took  a  hybrid  mix 
of  alternatives  you  would  begin  to  find  that  those  would  serve  as  a  preferred  and  safer,  and  less 
costly  alternative,  possibly.  But  the  current  alternative  analysis  doesn't  do  justice  to  what  really 
needs  to  be  done.  (0006-4-13  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  We  need  to  look  at  renewables,  we  need  to  look  at  a  mix  of  renewables.  It  is 
doable  if  we  commit  to  it.  And  when  I  say  we  I  mean  our  government  leaders,  and  our 
corporate  leaders,  and  our  educators.  It  is  doable  and,  ultimately,  I  think  will  be  more  cost 
effective.  (0006-4-18  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  I  wanted  to  make  another  point,  too.  And  that  is  with  respect  to  renewable  energy 
resources.  Obviously  most  of  us  are  aware  that  there  are  a  number  of  efforts,  under  way,  to 
bring  solar  energy,  wind  energy,  and  tidal  energy,  on-line,  particularly  here  in  New  Jersey. 

These  are  nascent  industries.  And  if  you  look  at  the  demand  that  is  projected  for  energy,  for  the 
next  10  to  20  years,  these  alternative,  or  renewable  energy  sources,  just  aren't  there  yet,  to 
deliver,  to  meet  that  demand,  nowhere  near  that.  A  lot  more  development  needs  to  occur  with 
respect  to  that.  (0006-6-5  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Comment:  In  addition  to  constantly  searching  for  ways  to  conserve  and  reduce  electrical 
usage.  Clearly,  the  use  of  nuclear  power  stands  out  as  a  viable  alternative  to  burning  fossil 
fuels  to  produce  electricity.  And  it  may  be  the  only  alternative  that  produces  24  hour  per  day 
baseload  power  with  no  carbon  missions.  Electricity  generation  represents  the  single  largest 
category  source  of  carbon  emissions  in  this  country.  Development  of  nuclear  power  resources 
has  a  strong  environmental  component,  associated  with  it,  compared  to  other  traditional  means 
of  electrical  generation.  (0006-8-6  [Duvau,  Bryan]) 

Comment:  A  substantial  percentage,  of  the  environmental  community,  are  outspoken 
advocates  for  the  use  of  renewables  as  a  viable  means  of  generating  carbon-free  energy  to 
meet  our  nation's  needs.  They  believe  that  solar  and  wind  energy  alternatives  are 
environmentally  benign,  compared  to  conventional  means  of  energy  generation.  Unfortunately 
many  of  these  proponents  are  misled,  regarding  the  immense  haul,  large  scale  wind  and  solar

installations  pose  to  avian,  bat,  and  terrestrial  species,  and  their  habitat.  (0006-9-2  [Wiwel, 

Kathy]) 

Comment:  And  I  don't  know  if  anybody  from  the  University  of  Delaware  is  here,  other  than  I 
know  David  Carter  is  associated  there.  But,  you  know,  there  are  a  lot  of  people  that  have  done 
a  lot  of  work  on  alternative  energy  systems,  up  there.  And  I  think  they  possibly  could  be 
consulted  as  to  some  of  these  alternatives.  Because  my  understanding  is,  you  know,  that  there 
are  combinations  of  alternative  energy  with  conservation  that  could,  possibly,  address  the 
purported  need.  (0007-13-2  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  This  is  a  really  important  point  in  time.  We  have  technology  that  can  provide  our 
energy  needs  without  using  nuclear  or  heavy  carbon  emitters.  (0007-4-9  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Comment:  The  National  Academies  make  three  important  observations.  First,  that  we  must 
ultimately  reach  zero  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  because  of  the  very  slow  rate  of  removal,  which 
I  have  mentioned.  Second,  that  at  the  current  state  of  technology,  wind  and  solar  energy 
installations  require  backup  by  fast  responding  power  sources.  And  the  only  one  available, 
today,  is  carbon  dioxide  emitting  natural  gas  turbines.  (0007-6-14  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  And  we  need  that  [new  baseload]  power  to  be  clean  power.  Solar  and  other 
sources  of  renewable  energy  are  great  sources  of  electricity.  And  were  considered  in  the 
analysis  of  the  need  for  a  new  plant.  Members  of  the  IBEW  Local  94  built  some  of  PSEG's  solar 
power  plants.  But  solar  is  not  a  substitute  for  around  the  clock  clean  baseload  power,  and 
would  have  significantly  greater  land  use  impacts  than  the  development  of  a  new  nuclear  plant 
on  the  existing  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  site.  (0007-8-5  [Spiese,  Steve]) 

Comment:  I'm  certainly  not  an  expert  on  energy  generation.  But  there  is  no  question  the  future 
of  welfare  of  human  society  depends  on  reducing  energy  use,  and  developing  zero  carbon 
sources  of  energy.  Many  experts  have  indicated  that  nuclear  power  represents  a  viable 
alternative  in  the  short  term,  must  be  part  of  any  mix  of  conservation,  and  new  energy  sources 
that  are  being  used  to  make  the  transition  to  a  zero  carbon  future.  (0007-9-10  [Wall,  Roland]) 

Comment:  The  men  and  women,  here  tonight,  who  have  said  no  to  everything  in  the  state  of 
Delaware,  no  to  the  Data  Center,  because  it  uses  natural  gas.  No  to  the  Delaware  City 
Refinery,  because  it  uses  crude  oil.  No  to  the  Port  of  Wilmington.  You  have  to  one  day  say  yes 
to  something.  If  they  want  to  maintain  the  standard  of  living,  that  we  have  come  to  live  with, 
every  day.  Wind  and  solar  are  not  the  only  thing  they  can  say  yes  to.  Yesterday  and  today  are 
perfect  examples  of  why  solar  has  so  many  drawbacks.  And  as  far  as  wind  it  is  mostly  made  in 
states  at  least  1,000  miles  away.  (0008-3-3  [Willis,  Martin]) 

Comment:  A  substantial  percentage  of  the  environmental  community  are  outspoken  advocates 
for  the  use  of  renewables  as  a  viable  means  of  generating  carbon-free  energy  to  meet  our 
nation’s  needs.  They  believe  that  solar  and  wind  energy  alternatives  are  environmentally 
benign,  compared  to  conventional  means  of  energy  generation.  Unfortunately  many  of  these

Comment:  In  comparison,  the  proposed  nuclear  plant,  at  the  PSEG  site,  will  generate  large 
amounts  of  carbon-free  power,  much  more  reliably,  than  any  renewable  power  facility.  This 
power  generation  can  take  place  at  a  plant  occupying  a  substantially  smaller  footprint  thus 
minimizing  any  adverse  impact  to  avian  and  bat  habitat.  (0008-6-5  [Wiwel,  Kathy]) 

Comment:  [A]  proper  combination  of  renewable  resources  was  not  adequately  considered. 
Intermittency  is  the  other  reason  for  not  adequately  considering  renewable  resources,  however 
distributed  solar  and  wind  turbines  placed  in  various  locations  throughout  New  Jersey  would 
help  alleviate  this  problem.  Solar  and  wind  are  often  complimentary-for  example,  it  is  windier  at 
night  when  the  sun  is  not  shining.  (0020-5-7  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  Alternative  energy  options  have  not  been  given  adequate  consideration.  Solar, 
geothermal,  and  new  and  emerging  sustainable  energy  options,  including  increased  efficiency 
and  conservation,  are  not  being  given  an  appropriate  level  of  consideration.  Renewable  energy 
sources  based  on  current  and  near  future  technologies  are  capable  of  producing  the  baseload 
power  targeted  by  PSEG.  (0022-11  [Butch,  Kerry  Margaret]  [King,  Charlotte]  [Pryde,  Coralie])

Steve]  [McNutt,  Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [Owens,  Caroline]  [Pringle,  David]  [Roe,  Amy]  [Tittel,  Jeff]  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  These  comments  focus  on  NRC's  analysis  of  alternative  sources  of  energy  in  the 
EIS — including  renewable  energy  sources— and  the  environmental  impacts  thereof  Section 
9.2.2  and  its  subsections  discuss  these  alternative  sources  of  energy.  Also,  Section  9.2.4 
addresses  combinations  of  energy  sources  that  could  be  used  for  new  electric  power  generation 
in  the  State  of  New  Jersey,  including  renewables  such  as  wind  energy,  solar  energy,  and 
biomass  (i.e.,  facilities  burning  wood  waste,  municipal  solid  waste,  and/or  methane  from 
landfills)  in  combination  with  natural-gas-fired  generation  facilities.  In  Section  9.2.4,  a  mix  of 
such  energy  sources  was  identified  that  would  generate  as  much  baseload  electricity  as  a  new 
nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  These  comments  do  not  provide  any  specific  information 
relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  alternative  energy  sources.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Industrial  wind  and  solar  energy  are  being  touted  as  the  best  way  to  reduce 
greenhouse  gases,  by  our  political  leaders,  most  of  the  environmental  organizations,  and  the 
general  public.  I  don't  believe  that  those  supporters  fully  understand  why  their  position  is  false. 
Aside  from  the  fact  that  the  capacity  factor  of  wind  generated  electricity  averages  around  30 
percent  for  land  based  turbines,  and  40  percent  for  offshore  turbines,  and  that  the  expected  life 
of  the  turbines  is  only  20  years,  the  supporters  are  unaware  of  the  many  environment 
downsides  of  industrial  wind.  The  NRC  staff  has  done  a  good  job  of  comparing  the  enormous 
amount  of  land  required  for  wind,  and  solar,  installations  compared  to  nuclear.  And  it  is 
staggering,  especially  when  the  reliability,  and  the  amount  of  energy  produced  is  factored  in.

Comment:  NRC's  analysis  fails  to  discuss  the  intermittency  of  nuclear  energy  due  to  planned 
and  unplanned  maintenance,  and  forced  shutdowns  due  to  cooling  water  issues  related  to 
warmer  ocean  temperatures.  Forced  shutdowns  due  to  cooling  water  issues  from  warm  ocean 
temperatures  are  only  predicted  to  increase  in  frequency.  For  nuclear  power  plants,  these 
"intermittent"  maintenance  times  can  last  more  than  a  year.  When  these  repairs  and 
unscheduled  shut  downs  are  considered,  renewables  are  in  fact  less  intermittent  and  more 
reliable  than  nuclear  energy.  (0020-5-8  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  analyses  of  alternative  energy  sources  In  Sections  9.2.2  and  9.2.4  include 
consideration  of  the  capacity  factor  for  the  various  sources  of  energy  identified  in  these 
comments,  including  nuclear.  The  comment  regarding  the  NRC  staff's  comparison  of  land-use 
reguirements  for  various  alternative  energy  sources  is  noted.  These  comments  do  not  provide 
any  specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  alternative  energy  sources.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  Going  over  the  slides,  under  page  19  it  has  alternative  energies.  None  of  the 
feasible  baseload  alternatives  were  being  environmentally  preferable.  That  statement,  in  itself, 
is  a  very,  very  untrue  and  unsubstantiated  comment  to  make.  Has  the  NRC  really  taken  a  look, 
and  PSEG  taken  a  look,  at  alternative  energy?  They  haven't.  (0007-3-1  [August,  Bernard]) 

Response:  The  reference  in  the  comment  to  page  19  of  the  slides  is  in  regard  to  the 
presentation  given  by  the  NRC  staff  at  the  public  meetings  on  the  draft  EIS.  The  slide 
summarizes  the  findings  of  the  EIS  in  regard  to  alternative  sources  of  energy;  that  is,  none  of 
the  feasible  base  load  alternatives  were  found  to  be  environmentally  preferable  to  a  new  nuclear 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  basis  for  this  conclusion  is  contained  in  Sections  9.2.2,  9.2.3,  and 
9. 2. 4  and  is  summarized  in  Section  9.2. 5.  None  of  the  feasible  baseload  energy  alternatives 
analyzed  in  this  EIS  was  found  to  offer  environmental  impacts  that  are  sufficiently  less  than 
those  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  to  establish  it  as  environmentally  preferable.  The  comment  does 
not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  alternative  energy 
sources.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  You  are  building  a  backbone  of  electrical  cords  all  the  way  down  from  Delaware  to 
Virginia,  for  windmills,  for  wind  generators.  And  so  it  is  safe  to  say  nuclear  energy,  there  is  no 
alternative  feasible,  alternative  baseload  to  that  is  ridiculous.  (0007-3-10  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  Already  the  free  market  is  building,  Google  is  building  a  backbone  for  wind  mills  off 
the  coast  of  this,  from  Delaware  to  Virginia.  They  have  spent  billions  of  dollars.  And  we  are 
held  up,  in  Delaware,  because  of  the  fossil  fuel  industry,  from  having  windmills,  11  miles  off 
shore,  which  will  replace  all  the  energy  that  Delaware  needs.  Safely,  no  evacuation  zones,  no 
bird  kills,  no  effects  on  the  ocean,  whatsoever  (0008-9-11  [August,  Bernard]) 

Response:  Section  9. 2. 1.1  discusses  the  purchase  of  electrical  power  instead  of  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  As  noted  in  that  section,  studies  indicate  that 
there  will  not  be  surplus  electrical  generating  capacity  available  from  nearby  portions  of  PJM  or 
from  the  New  York  Independent  System  Operator  region  (which  borders  on  PJM).  These 
studies  also  indicate  that  even  if  such  surplus  capacity  were  to  become  available,  there  is  not 
likely  to  be  excess  electrical  transmission  capacity  available  into  New  Jersey  in  the  timeframe

when  the  new  nuclear  units  would  become  operational.  At  this  time,  the  offshore  transmission 
line  that  is  being  backed  by  Google  is  conceptual  and  construction  of  the  cable  has  not  started. 
The  estimated  completion  date  for  the  first  phase  of  the  project,  which  would  only  link  southern 
and  northern  New  Jersey,  is  currently  2020  to  2021.  The  comment  does  not  provide  any 
specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  alternative  energy  sources.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Alternative  energy  options  have  not  been  given  adequate  consideration. 

Sustainable  energy  options  such  as  solar,  wind,  geothermal,  and  energy  efficiency  and 
conservation  measures  have  not  been  adequately  considered  by  the  NRC.  The  reasons  given 
for  not  adequately  considering  these  sources  are  that  renewables  require  "lengthy  new 
transmission  lines"  and  that  they  cannot  provide  base  load  power  because  of  intermittency 
issues.  This  flippant  dismissal  is  unfounded  and  does  not  take  into  account  proposed 
transmission  such  as  the  New  Jersey  Energy  Link  by  the  Atlantic  Wind  Connection-an  offshore 
transmission  line  that  would  run  along  the  coast  of  New  Jersey  [see 

http://atlanticwindconnection.com/home].  There  appears  to  be  a  double  standard  in  that  the 
proposed  nuclear  project  would  require  lengthy  new  transmission  lines,  but  this  does  not  seem 
to  be  a  concern  to  NRC  in  that  context.  (0020-5-5  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  While  the  analysis  of  alternative  energy  sources  in  Section  9.2.4  mentions  the  new 
transmission  lines  that  might  be  associated  with  any  new  electricity  generation  facilities,  neither 
the  existence  of  any  such  new  transmissions  lines  nor  their  length  was  used  as  a  discriminator 
to  dismiss  renewable  energy  sources  from  detailed  analysis,  in  fact,  Section  9.2.4  includes  a 
detailed  analysis  of  a  combination  of  energy  sources— including  renewable  sources  of  energy— 
that  could  generate  the  same  amount  of  baseload  electrical  power  as  a  new  nuclear  plant.  The 
comment  does  not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of 
alternative  energy  sources.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Even  without  such  disaster,  the  federal  officials  admit  that  there  will  most  likely  be 
"small  to  moderate  environmental  impacts."  I'd  like  to  know  what  research  the  NRC  is  citing  in 
today's  News  Journal  article  where  they  say  that  wind  power  would  have  greater  environmental 
downsides?  That  is  absurd.  (0024-4  [Doyle,  Kathy]) 

Response:  The  commenter  appears  to  be  referencing  a  Wilmington  News  Journal  article  dated 
December  5,  20 1 4.  The  characterization  of  the  staff’s  conclusion  regarding  wind  power  reflects 
the  reporter's  understanding  of  the  outcome.  However,  the  EIS  never  says  that  wind  power  (nor 
any  of  the  other  alternative  energy  sources  identified  and  evaluated  in  Section  9.2  et  seq.) 
would  have  greater  environmental  downsides  than  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Section  9.2.5  contains  the  NRC  staff's  conclusion  that  none  of  the  feasible  baseload  alternatives 
were  found  to  be  environmentally  preferable  to  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The 
comment  does  not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of 
alternative  energy  sources.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  "Alternative  energy  supplies,  such  as  wind,  are  either  incapable  of  meeting 
electricity  needs  or  would  have  greater  environmental  downsides,  the  NRC  concluded."  I  am 
trying  to  wrap  my  head  around  this  statement.  I  can  see  how  offshore  wind  would  not  provide 
continuous  levels  of  power  to  the  grid,  but  how  in  the  world  can  the  NRC  compare  the  deaths  of

birds  hitting  turbine  blades  to  the  inability  of  the  nuclear  industry  to  provide  a  means  of  dealing 
with  nuclear  waste  for  the  long  term  or  the  very  real  possibility  of  a  release  of  radioactive  gasses 
into  the  air  that  we  breathe  here  in  Delaware?  We  act  as  if  the  only  concern  for  tomorrow  is  rate 
of  return  for  investors.  Every  energy  choice  we  make  should  take  long  range  consequences 
into  consideration.  Has  that  really  been  the  case  with  Salem  3?  (0027-1  [Nielsen,  Michael]) 

Response:  The  com  men  ter  appears  to  be  referencing  a  Wilmington  News  Journal  article  dated 
December  5,  2014.  The  characterization  of  the  staff's  conclusion  regarding  wind  power  reflects 
the  reporter's  understanding  of  the  outcome.  The  comment  generally  expresses  concern  about 
NRC's  analysis  of  alternative  sources  of  energy.  Section  9.2.4  addresses  combinations  of 
energy  sources  that  could  be  used  for  new  electric  power  generation  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey, 
including  renewables  such  as  wind  energy,  solar  energy,  and  biomass  (i.e.,  facilities  burning 
wood  waste,  municipal  solid  waste,  and/or  methane  from  landfills)  in  combination  with  natural- 
gas- fired  generation  facilities.  Section  9.2.5  presents  the  NRC  staff's  conclusion  that  none  of 
the  feasible  baseload  alternatives  were  found  to  be  environmentally  preferable  to  a  new  nuclear 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  comment  does  not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the 
environmental  effects  of  alternative  energy  sources.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  But  the  main  objection  is  economic.  The  use  of  natural  gas  is  currently  much 
cheaper,  partly  because  the  extensive  nuclear  cooling  system  represents  cost,  both  as 
investment  and  operation/upkeep.  But  additionally,  the  use  of  LNG  as  a  co-generative  fuel  has 
not  been  considered.  It  will  probably  be  the  most  efficient  source,  and  has  revolutionary 
potentiality  in  the  development  of  natural  gas  in  terms  of  collection,  manufacture,  distribution, 
and  use.  The  use  concerns  both  utilities  and  rail  use.  (0033-2  [Clapp,  Leonard]) 

Response:  Section  9.2. 3.2  addresses  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the 
construction  and  operation  of  a  natural-gas-fired  power  generation  facility  at  the  PSEG  Site.  It 
is  not  dear  from  the  comment  how  the  commenter  believes  the  use  of  liquefied  natural  gas 
would  differ  from  the  use  of  natural  gas.  The  impacts  of  a  liquefied-natural-gas-fired  facility 
would  be  similar  to,  if  not  identical  with,  those  of  a  natural-gas-fired  facility.  Co-generation  is  not 
a  consideration  for  the  proposed  action  in  this  EIS,  because  the  need  is  for  additional  electrical 
power  and  not  heat  or  other  forms  of  energy.  The  comment  does  not  provide  any  specific 
information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  alternative  energy  sources.  No  changes 
were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  You  are  also  committing  the  state,  also  committing  this  state  to  failing  to  reach  the 
22.5  percent  renewable  energy  goal.  We  have  all  set  this  goal,  within  the  state,  to  try  to  begin 
to  produce  electricity  more  reliably  using  renewables,  and  building  another  nuclear  power  plant 
will  not  be  helping  get  this  state  closer  to  that  goal.  In  fact,  we  would  really  be  going  the  other 
way.  So  we  are  defeating  our  own  goals  by  allowing  this  plant  to  be  built.  (0006-4-14  [Brook, 
David]) 

Comment:  New  Jersey  has  set  a  goal  of  each  electricity  supplier  obtaining  22.5%  of  its 
electricity  from  renewable  energy  sources  by  2021 .  The  DEIS  fails  to  consider  the  importance 
of  this  goal.  (0020-5-11  [van  Rossum,  Maya])

Response:  These  comments  focus  on  New  Jersey's  goals  for  generating  electricity  from 
renewable  energy  sources.  Section  9.2.2  discusses  New  Jersey's  renewable  energy  portfolio 
as  implemented  through  the  State's  renewable  portfolio  standard  regulations.  The  22.5  percent 
goal  for  power  generated  from  qualifying  renewables  is  discussed  in  that  section.  The 
construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site  would  not  necessarily 
contribute  to  any  inability  of  suppliers/providers  serving  retail  customers  in  the  state  to  meet  the 
renewable  portfolio  standard  goals.  In  addition,  the  enforcement  of  the  renewable  portfolio 
standard  regulations  lies  with  the  State  of  New  Jersey  and  not  with  the  NRC.  These  comments 
do  not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  alternative  energy 
sources.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  PV  solar  power  located  on  rooftops  is  a  good  source  of  renewable  energy  because 
the  energy  produced  does  not  need  to  be  transported  over  transmission  lines  but  can,  easily, 
directly  applied  below,  and  requires  no  additional  land.  Industrial  sized  solar  arrays,  on  the 
other  hand,  require  both  a  great  deal  of  land,  and  the  need  for  energy  produced  to  be 
transported  over  greater  distances.  One  of  the  enormous  arrays  of  mirrors,  in  the  desert's 
southwest,  has  proven  to  be  a  huge  killer  of  birds  and  flying  insects.  They  are  attracted  to  the 
area,  then  drawn  to  their  fiery  death.  The  panels  and  mirrors  are,  also,  in  constant  need  to  be 
washed,  to  be  effective,  which  poses  a  problem  in  the  arid  desert.  (0004-12-7  [Eastman,  Alice 
(Ajax)]) 

Comment:  While  I  personally  think  a  system  of  localized  smaller  scale  generation  and 
distribution  would  be  better  in  the  long  term,  that  is  not  the  system  we  are  living  in  today,  given 
our  network  and  PJM.  (0004-14-3  [Moscovici,  Dan]) 

Comment:  Also,  the  baseload  model  that  we  have  been  having,  for  the  last  200  years,  is  going 
by  the  way  of  the  Tin  Lizzy.  I'm  a  solar  producer.  I  will  be  able  to  supply  my  own  electricity,  at 
my  own  house,  with  battery,  current  battery  technology,  and  conservation.  (0007-3-11  [August, 
Bernard]) 

Comment:  So  the  idea  that  this  plant,  that  this  site  is  going  to  be  used  for  a  nuclear  plant, 
instead  of  something  that  could  be  like  a  windmill,  to  the  co-generation  systems,  or  natural  gas 
plant,  which  is  already  killed  your  industry.  Fracking  and  natural  gas  plants  have  put  you  guys 
out  of  business.  So  this  is  a  last  grab  straw.  (0007-3-15  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  The  company  that  owns  PSEG  Exelon,  is  vilurently  against  alternative  energy,  and 
wind  power,  and  solar.  (0007-3-2  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  Powering  New  Jersey  with  one  hundred  percent  renewables  could  be  done  through 
a  combination  of  diverse  renewable  energy  sources  and  energy  efficiency  measures.  This  is 
another  area  where  NRC's  analysis  has  fallen  short-NRC  has  failed  to  adequately  consider 
energy  efficiency  measures.  For  the  abovementioned  reasons,  NRC  has  not  properly 
considered  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  as  an  alternative,  and  therefore  their 
analysis  is  deficient.  (0020-5-10  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  NRC  has  not  adequately  considered  all  renewable  energy  options,  such  as 
distributed  solar,  which  would  reduce  the  need  for  new  transmission  and  reduce  the  source's

intermittency.  It  appears  as  though  only  large  solar  arrays  and  large  wind  farms  were 
considered;  however  renewable  energy  sources  could  be  placed  closer  to  demand  via 
distributed  generation,  reducing  land  use  impacts,  intermittency,  and  transmission  costs. 
Distributed  solar  can  be  placed  on  rooftops  and  parking  garages  in  cities  where  the  demand 
centers  are  located;  open  fields  are  not  required  for  renewable  energy  generation.  For  these 
reasons,  the  cited  "land  use  impacts"  of  wind  and  solar  are  incorrect.  (0020-5-6  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Comment:  A  recent  study  found  that  New  Jersey  has  the  ability  to  generate  one  hundred 
percent  of  its  power  from  renewables  [see  Jacobson  et  al.  (2014)  100%  Wind,  Water,  Sunlight 
(WWS)  All-Sector  Energy  Plans  for  the  50  United  States.  July  17,  2014],  This  same  study 
found  that  renewable  energy  sources  would  be  cheaper  for  ratepayers  on  a  time  scale  that  falls 
within  the  lifetime  of  the  proposed  nuclear  plant.  (0020-5-9  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  These  comments  generally  indicate  that  renewable  energy  alternatives  could  meet 
the  need  for  power  and  that  the  NRC  staff's  analysis  of  energy  alternatives  did  not  give 
sufficient  consideration  to  the  renewable  energy  alternatives.  The  NRC  staff  did  consider 
renewable  energy  sources  as  alternatives  the  EIS,  which  considered  such  sources  both 
individually  (see  Section  9.2.2),  and  as  part  of  a  combination  of  energy  alternatives  ( see  Section 
9.2.4).  The  staff  concluded  that  none  of  the  renewable  sources  could  meet  the  projected  need 
for  baseload  power  generation  individually,  either  because  of  intermittency  of  the  source  or  the 
state  of  development  of  the  alternative.  For  the  combination  of  energy  alternatives,  the  NRC 
staff  took  into  consideration  the  New  Jersey  renewable  portfolio  standard  and  the  energy- 
demand  projections  from  authoritative  sources,  such  as  the  U.  S.  Department  of  Energy.  Based 
on  available  information,  the  combination  of  energy  alternatives — while  meeting  the  need  for 
baseload  power  generation — would  not  be  environmentally  preferable  to  the  proposed  action. 

No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  I  want  to  say  that  I  think  that  the  EIS  process  overlooks  two  key  issues  that  I  think 
the  NRC  needs  to  address.  When  it  looks  at  what  alternatives  are  considered,  it  talks  about  no¬ 
action.  It  talks  about  alternative  sites,  talks  about  alternative  energy  sources.  I  think  it  should 
also  consider  what  are  the  energy  conservation  opportunities  here.  Because  when  you 
compare  U.S.  energy  consumption  to  those  in  western  Europe,  we  are  using  four  times  as  much 
energy,  per  capita,  because  of  our  wasteful  energy  practices.  So  if  you  consider  energy 
conservation,  alternative  energies,  there  is  a  significantly  less  need  for  nuclear  power,  and  a 
much  lower  cost.  (0007-11-3  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Response:  The  comment  suggests  that  energy  conservation  has  been  overlooked  in  the  staff's 
analysis  of  alternatives  to  a  new  nuclear  plant.  Any  alternative  energy  source  must  be  able  to 
meet  the  requirement  for  producing  2,200  MW(e)  of  new  baseload  power  to  supply  the  future 
needs  of  the  service  region.  As  discussed  in  Section  9.2. 1.3  of  the  EIS,  the  review  team 
concluded  that  conservation  and  demand-side  management  programs  can  be  successful  in 
reducing  peak  load.  As  discussed  in  Section  8.2,  the  State  of  New  Jersey  has  established 
energy-management  goals  to  maximize  energy  conservation  and  energy  efficiency  by  reducing 
energy  consumption  at  least  20  percent  by  2020,  using  1999  energy  consumption  as  the 
baseline.  Elowever,  those  energy  savings  have  already  been  accounted  for  in  power  planning, 
and  there  is  still  a  demonstrated  need  for  additional  baseload  capacity,  as  discussed  in 


NUREG-2168 


E-184

Appendix  E 


Chapter  8  of  this  EIS.  Thus,  the  implementation  of  conservation  and  demand-side  management 
programs  is  not  a  reasonable  alternative  for  providing  baseload  power  generating  capacity.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-38;  Section  No.  9.2.4;  Line  No.  13-15;  The  assessment  of  land  use  for 
a  combination  of  power  sources  does  not  account  for  the  land  use  associated  with  wind  power, 
which  would  be  30,400  acres,  not  including  land  use  associated  with  new  transmission  lines. 
When  the  land  use  of  wind  power  plus  its  transmission  lines  is  taken  into  account,  the  land  use 
for  a  combination  of  power  sources  should  be  classified  as  LARGE.  (0015-6-2  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  Wind  energy  is  discussed  in  the  context  of  an  offshore  wind  farm,  which  would 
have  no  land- use  impacts.  While  some  land-use  impacts  associated  with  transmission  lines  for 
such  a  wind  farm  would  likely  occur,  it  is  not  possible  for  the  review  team  to  estimate  those 
impacts  because  the  location  of  the  wind  farm  and  transmission  lines  is  unknown.  It  is  unlikely 
that  the  transmission  lines  by  themselves  would  cause  LARGE  impacts  to  land  use.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  The  new  transmission  lines  should  also  be  discussed  in  the  alternatives  analysis  in 
the  DEIS,  since  smaller  scale  and  decentralized  power  generation  alternatives  can  avoid  the 
large-scale  land  use  disruption  that  new  transmission  lines  will  cause.  (0020-5-1  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Response:  As  discussed  in  Section  3. 2. 2. 2  of  the  E/S,  the  existing  transmission  lines  that  are 
connected  to  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  have  sufficient  capacity  to  accommodate  the  power 
from  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  no  new  transmission  lines  are  needed 
for  the  purpose  of  transmitting  the  power  from  a  new  plant.  The  regional  transmission  operator 
has  requested  bids  to  build  a  new  line  near  the  site  to  address  grid  stability  issues ;  however, 
that  request  for  bids  is  independent  of  any  new  power  plant  that  might  be  built  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Some  portions  of  the  combination-of-energy  alternatives  (e.g.,  wind  and  solar),  including  those 
portions  built  at  locations  other  than  the  PSEG  Site,  may  require  new  transmission  lines,  as 
mentioned  in  Section  9.2.4.  However,  the  uncertainty  regarding  any  such  lines  prevented  the 
staff  from  estimating  the  associated  environmental  impacts,  and  so,  these  transmission  lines,  if 
needed,  were  not  a  discriminating  factor  between  the  combination-of-energy  alternative  and  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of 
this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-12;  Section  No.  9.2.2. 1 ;  Line  No.  24;  The  conclusion  for  wind  power

Response:  The  rationale  for  the  review  team's  conclusion  regarding  wind  power  is  provided  in 
the  sentence  immediately  following  the  one  mentioned  in  the  comment.  The  revision 
recommended  in  the  comment  is  therefore  not  necessary,  and  no  changes  were  made  to  the 
EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment.

E.2.29  Comments  Concerning  System  Design  Alternatives 

Comment:  A  new  plant  will  provide  an  excellent  opportunity  to  incorporate  new  technology  to 
produce  cleaner,  safer  energy  especially  if  a  cooling  tower  is  incorporated  to  significantly  reduce 
bay  water  usage,  the  impingement  and  entrainment  of  aquatic  biota,  and  the  impact  of  large 
quantities  of  elevated  temperature  water  reentering  the  estuary.  I  know  of  no  scientific  study 
that  proves  that  the  present  cooling  process  at  Salem  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  estuary. 
(0009-5  [Locandro,  Roger]) 

Comment:  Executive  Summary,  Page  xx  (Lines  30-31);  Comment:  The  [NJDEP]  Department 
supports  PSEG's  proposed  plant  design  that  will  use  either  mechanical  or  natural  draft  cooling 
towers  to  remove  waste  heat  from  the  water  discharge.  This  is  consistent  with  current  Section 
316(b)  regulations  which  require  new  facilities  with  a  design  intake  flow  equal  to  or  greater  than 
10  MGD  to  maintain  the  intake  flow  of  cooling  water  at  a  level  commensurate  with  that 
achievable  with  a  closed  cycle,  recirculating  cooling  system.  (0021-5-14  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Response:  These  comments  are  declarative  statements  and  raise  no  issues  with  the 
conclusions  of  the  draft  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

E.2.30  Comments  Concerning  Alternative  Sites 

Comment:  The  existing  PSEG  existing  nuclear  complex  is  an  ideal  location  for  the  additional 
unit,  because  all  of  the  important  conveyance  systems  are  in  place,  and  will  not  have  to  be 
developed,  and  built,  as  with  a  greenfield  site.  (0004-16-9  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  Locating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  disturbed  land,  adjacent  to  an  area  that  is 
already  dedicated  to  nuclear  power  generation,  makes  the  most  sense.  Much  of  the 
infrastructure  inherent  in  a  nuclear  generation  site  can  easily  be  applied  to  the  development  of  a 
new  facility,  rather  than  locating  that  new  facility  on  a  previously  undeveloped  site.  (0006-8-7 
[Duvau,  Bryan]) 

Comment:  The  existing  nuclear  complex  is  an  ideal  location  for  an  additional  unit  because  the 
importance  conveyance,  or  transmission  systems  are  in  place,  and  would  not  have  to  be 
developed,  such  as  it  was  in  the  Greenfield  site.  (0007-16-8  [Palmer,  Dennis]) 

Comment:  Much  of  the  needed  science  for  the  ESP  should  be  at  hand  since  the  site  is 
contiguous  to  the  Hope  Creek  and  Salem  Creek  generation  stations.  Their  track  record  appears 
to  be  good.  The  new  site  will  share  the  same  geology  and  the  use  of  in  place  dredge  spoils 
constituting  all  soils  of  the  area-i.e.,  an  artificial  Island.  Natural  resource  impacts  must  be  the 
same  for  all  sites  in  this  homogeneous  environment.  (0009-3  [Locandro,  Roger]) 

Response:  These  comments  generally  support  the  selection  of  the  PSEG  Site  for  the  ESP. 
Section  9.3  of  the  EIS  describes  the  process  of  identifying  and  evaluating  alternative  sites  in 
New  Jersey  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Three  of  the  candidate  alternative  sites  are 
greenfield  sites.  The  conclusion  in  Sections  9. 3. 6. 3  and  9. 3. 6. 3  is  that  none  of  the  alternative 
sites  is  environmentally  preferable  or  obviously  superior  to  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments.

Comment:  Page  No.  9-229;  Section  No.  9.3.6;  Line  No.  39-40;  The  term  "environmentally 
preferable"  is  used  for  the  first  time  here  and  is  used  several  other  times  in  Section  9.3.6,  but  it 
is  never  defined.  It  might  be  useful  to  add  the  definition  included  in  NUREG-1555,  that  an 
"environmentally  preferable  site"  means  a  site  for  which  "the  environmental  impacts  are 
sufficiently  less  than  for  the  proposed  site  such  that  environmental  preference  can  be 
established."  (0015-6-17  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-233;  Section  No.  9. 3. 6.1;  Table  9-24;  Waste  Management  is  one  of  the 
resource  areas  that  has  impact  ratings  in  Table  9-24,  but  Waste  Management  is  the  only 
resource  area  that  does  not  have  an  impact  discussion  in  the  text  for  each  site.  It  appears  that 
the  general  discussion  on  pages  9-55  and  9-56  is  intended  to  address  Waste  Management 
impacts,  but  there  is  no  clear  connection  between  that  discussion  and  the  impact  ratings  in 
Table  9-24.  In  addition,  the  location  of  the  Waste  Management  row  between  Radiological 
Health  and  Postulated  Accidents  suggests  that  it  refers  to  radioactive  waste,  but  we  believe  it 
actually  refers  to  nonradioactive  waste.  (0015-6-19  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-44;  Section  No.  9.3.1;  Line  No.  31-32;  Change  "...leading  to  the

Comment:  Page  No.  9-44;  Section  No.  9.3. 1.1;  Line  No.  37-39;  The  DEIS  discussion  of  why 
PSEG  selected  New  Jersey  as  the  ROI  does  not  mention  that  NJ  provides  good  diversity  of 
environmental  and  geographic  conditions  for  potential  power  plant  sites  and  that  any  reasonable 
expansion  of  the  ROI  beyond  NJ  would  not  significantly  improve  diversity,  as  discussed  in  ER 
Section  9. 3. 1.1.  This  supporting  information  might  be  useful  in  explaining  the  ROI  selection  to 
the  public.  (0015-6-5  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-47;  Section  No.  9. 3. 1.2;  Line  No.  32-33;  Change  "Furthermore,  the 
PSEG  quantitative  evaluation...."  to  "Furthermore,  the  PSEG  qualitative  evaluation...."  This 
sentence  refers  to  a  part  of  the  evaluation  that  was  not  quantified.  (0015-6-6  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  These  comments  contain  recommendations  for  revisions  and/or  changes  to  the 
text  in  the  EIS.  in  response  to  these  comments,  the  EIS  has  been  revised  at  the  locations 
indicated  in  the  respective  comments;  however,  the  specific  revisions  that  have  been 
incorporated  into  this  EIS  may  not  exactly  match  the  language  contained  in  the 
recommendations  in  each  comment. 

Comment:  Two,  do  you  work  with  the  United  States,  USGS,  on  the  siting  of  these  plants,  and 
what  criteria  do  they  have  inputs  on,  on  the  siting  of  the  plant?  (0007-3-7  [August.  Bernard]) 

Response:  USGS  Data  are  used  in  preparing  the  EIS  and  the  NRC's  SER,  but  the  NRC  grants 
the  ultimate  approval.  The  PSEG  ESP  applicant  relied  on  USGS-developed  geologic 
information  in  its  application,  including  for  describing  the  seismic  characteristics  of  the  site  as 
well  as  the  regional  geology.  In  its  technical  review  of  the  application,  the  NRC  considers  that 
information  as  well,  and  may  confer  directly  with  the  USGS  to  the  extent  necessary.  The  USGS

information  is  considered  both  in  the  NRC  safety  evaluation  (for  determining  whether  the  site 
safety  requirements  are  met)  and  in  the  draft  EIS  (for  describing  the  affected  environment).  No 
changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-232;  Section  No.  9.3.6. 1;  Table  9-24;  This  table  shows  the  cumulative 
impact  rating  for  each  site,  but  it  does  not  indicate  whether  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
plant  would  contribute  significantly  to  those  impacts  or  not.  Given  that  the  impact  contribution  of 
the  new  plant  figures  prominently  in  the  discussion  in  Section  9. 3. 6. 2,  it  would  be  useful  to 
include  that  information  in  Table  9-24.  (0015-6-18  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  As  noted  in  the  comment,  Table  9-24  does  not  indicate  whether  the  N Re¬ 
authorized  activities  associated  with  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  contribute  significantly  to  the  level  of  impacts  shown  in  the  table;  however,  the  text 
accompanying  Table  9-24  (i.e.,  the  text  in  Section  9. 3.6. 2)  does  discuss  the  contributions  of  the 
NRC-authorized  activities  when  it  compares  the  impacts  among  and  between  the  alternative 
sites.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-234;  Section  No.  9. 3. 6. 2;  Line  No.  1-8;  The  discussion  of  impacts  at 
Site  4-1  does  not  mention  the  fact  that  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  would 
contribute  significantly  to  the  MODERATE  impact  on  terrestrial  resources,  as  stated  in  lines  7 
and  8  on  page  9-81 .  The  discussion  of  Site  7-2  impacts  (lines  24  to  26  on  page  9-234)  includes 
this  point,  and  it  should  be  included  for  Site  4-1 ,  where  the  situation  is  the  same.  (0015-6-20 
[Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-234;  Section  No.  9. 3. 6. 2;  Line  No.  10-19;  The  discussion  of  impacts  at 
Site  7-1  does  not  mention  the  fact  that  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  would 
contribute  significantly  to  the  MODERATE  impact  on  terrestrial  resources,  as  stated  in  lines  3 
and  4  on  page  9-130.  The  discussion  of  Site  7-2  impacts  (lines  24  to  26  on  page  9-234) 
includes  this  point,  and  it  should  be  included  for  Site  7-1,  where  the  situation  is  the  same.  (0015- 
7-2  [Mallon,  James]) 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-234;  Section  No.  9. 3. 6. 2;  Line  No.  31-39;  The  discussion  of  impacts  at 
Site  7-3  does  not  mention  the  fact  that  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  would 
contribute  significantly  to  the  MODERATE  impact  on  terrestrial  resources,  as  stated  in  lines  38 
and  39  on  page  9-210.  The  discussion  of  Site  7-2  impacts  (lines  24  to  26  on  page  9-234) 
includes  this  point,  and  it  should  be  included  for  Site  7-3,  where  the  situation  is  the  same.  (0015- 
7-3  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  These  comments  concern  apparent  discrepancies  in  the  discussion  of  impacts  to 
terrestrial  resources  among  and  between  the  alternative  sites.  The  discussions  in  Section 
9. 6. 3. 2  focus  on  comparing  each  of  the  four  alternative  sites  to  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  The 
text  therefore  does  not  include  any  discussion  of  the  situation  where  there  are  no  differences  in 
impact  levels  between  the  alternative  site  and  the  PSEG  Sites,  but  rather,  focuses  on  the 
situation  where  differences  in  impact  levels  do  exist.  Thus,  impacts  to  terrestrial  resources  are 
not  discussed  in  the  comparison  of  sites  in  Section  9. 6. 3. 2,  since  building  and  operating  a  new 
nuclear  plant  at  any  of  the  sites  would  create  MODE R A  TE  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetlands 
resources.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments.

Appendix  E 


Comment:  Page  No.  9-234;  Section  No.  9. 3. 6. 2;  Line  No.  6-7;  These  lines  indicate  that  the 
LARGE  impact  rating  for  historic  and  cultural  resources  at  Site  4-1  is  related  to  building  and 
operating  a  new  nuclear  plant,  but  this  is  contradicted  by  the  discussion  on  page  9-101,  which 
says  "Building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  Site  4-1  would  not  be  a  significant 
contributor  to  the  [historic  and  cultural  resource]  impacts."  (0015-7-1  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  text  referenced  in  the  comment  on  page  9-101  (Section  9.3.2. 7)  has  been 
revised  to  state  that  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  Site  4- 1  would  be  a  significant 
contributor  to  the  impacts  to  historic  and  cultural  resources  at  that  site. 

Comment:  Page  No.  9-2;  Section  No.  9.0;  Line  No.  19;  The  term  "these  types  of  areas"  is 
vague  and  undefined.  A  more  specific  description  should  be  provided.  (0015-5-14  [Mallon, 
James]) 

Response:  The  commenter  is  reguesting  clarification  of  terminology  that  is  being  used  as 
direct  language  from  the  cited  reference,  40  CFR  230  (76  FR  24479-  TN247).  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Section  9.0  Environmental  Impacts  of  Alternatives:  This  section  does  not  evaluate 
on-site  alternatives  to  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  to  aquatic  resources.  We  recognize  that  as 
part  of  NRC's  Early  Site  Permit  process,  PSEG  has  only  developed  a  Plant  Parameter  Envelope 
(PPE),  or  an  estimate  of  the  highest  potential  impacts  that  could  result  from  the  construction  of  a 
new  nuclear  generating  station.  They  have  not  yet  determined  if  they  will  build  the  facility  and 
what  technology  they  will  use  if  they  choose  to  construct  the  new  facility.  If  NRC  issues  an 
ESP,  PSEG  will  have  twenty  years  to  make  that  decision.  Because  PSEG  has  not  yet 
determined  the  actual  footprint  of  the  proposed  new  nuclear  generating  station,  it  is  not  possible 
to  demonstrate  compliance  with  Clean  Water  Act  (CWA)  404  (b)  (1 )  Guidelines.  These 
Guidelines  require  it  to  first  be  demonstrated  that  potential  impacts  to  aquatic  resources  have 
been  avoided  and  minimized  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable.  For  non-water  dependent 
activities,  such  as  this,  there  is  a  presumption  in  the  CWA  that  alternatives  that  do  not  involve 
special  aquatic  sites,  including  wetlands,  exist  and  that  these  alternatives  would  have  less 
impact  on  the  aquatic  environment.  In  this  case,  it  cannot  be  demonstrated  that  impacts  have 
been  minimized  because  a  plant  design  has  not  been  chosen.  Alternatives  may  exist  that  would 
reduce  the  amount  of  dredging  and  fill  currently  being  proposed.  (0018-1-9  [Chiarella,  Louis]) 

Response:  Prior  to  the  issuance  of  any  Department  of  the  Army  authorization,  the  USACE 
would  require  documentation  to  clearly  demonstrate  all  efforts  to  avoid,  minimize,  and 
compensate  for  any  impacts  to  waters  of  the  United  States,  including  wetlands. 

E.2.31  Comments  Concerning  Benefit-Cost  Balance 

Comment:  [T]he  people  of  New  Jersey,  and  the  region,  have  benefitted  from  the  cost 
competitive  electricity  generated  from  the  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  plants.  (0004-13-2  [Miller, 

Lynn]) 

Comment:  In  terms  of  the  environmental  regulation,  and  the  balance,  I  use  the  word  balance 
on  purpose,  because  there  is  that  need  to  balance  the  socioeconomic  impacts,  and  the 
environmental  impacts,  and  the  need  for  industry  to  have  affordable  and  reliable  electric.  And  I

think  we  have  had  that,  seen  that  happen  over  at  the  site,  and  hope  to  continue.  (0007-18-3 
[Kleinschmidt,  Mark]) 

Response:  These  comments  provide  general  support  of  nuclear  power.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  On  top  of  that  we  have  one  of  the  most  expensive  costs  of  energy,  not  only  in  this 
region,  but  in  the  United  States.  And  we  have  made  efforts  to  lower  it.  This  project,  itself,  has 
the  potential  to  reduce  transmission  congestion  which,  consequently,  will  lower  the  cost  of 
energy  in  our  state.  (0004-24-3  [Heffron,  Rich]) 

Response:  The  price  of  electricity  is  outside  the  regulatory  scope  of  the  NRC's  licensing 
actions;  however,  the  regional  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  proposed  action,  including  impacts 
to  the  local  economy,  are  addressed  in  Sections  4. 4  and  5. 4  of  the  EIS.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Scientists,  in  my  understanding,  of  nuclear  energy,  nuclear  electrical  energy,  is  that 
it  is  a  net  energy  loss.  Net  energy  loss.  What  do  I  mean  by  that?  Simply  that  it  takes  more 
energy,  in  the  form  of  diesel,  concrete,  all  the  other  forms  of  energy,  to  mine  uranium,  refine  it, 
transport  it,  construct  the  plants,  safely  operate  them  and,  finally,  decommission  a  nuclear 
power  plant,  than  all  of  the  energy  it  will  ever  produce.  (0006-4-6  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  It  would  probably  cost  us  less,  and  produce  more  electricity,  more  safely,  if  we 
simply  took  the  billions  of  dollars  that  it  is  going  to  cost,  to  build  this  plant,  and  buy  solar  panels, 
and  wind  turbines,  for  everyone  in  New  Jersey.  (0006-4-9  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  So  this  idea  that  we  should,  as  rate  payers  and  stakeholders,  should  be  paying 
billions  of  dollars,  and  costs  of  our  tax  money,  to  subsidize  this  industry,  which  is  what  we  have 
been  doing,  and  taxing,  and  going  to  our  local  PS,  public  service  commissions,  and  asking  for 
rate  increases  for  products  we  are  not  even  going  to  be  able  to  see  finished  in  about  15  years. 
(0007-3-13  [August,  Bernard]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  opposition  to  nuclear  power  and  the  nuclear  power 
industry  and  raise  no  issues  with  the  conclusions  in  the  discussion  of  benefit-cost  balance  in 
Section  10.6  of  the  EIS.  The  NRC  is  an  independent  regulatory  agency  that  does  not  promote 
nuclear  or  other  types  of  energy.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these 
comments. 

Comment:  Page  No.  10-25;  Section  No.  10.6.1;  Given  the  substantial  reduction  in  GHG 
attributable  to  nuclear,  the  benefits  to  air  quality  improvements  should  be  rated  as  MODERATE. 
(0015-7-13  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  This  comment  suggests  revising  the  air-quality  impact  of  the  proposed  project 
based  on  the  low  GHG  contribution  of  a  nuclear  plant.  The  NRC  staff  considered  this  revision 
but  made  no  change  to  the  EIS. 

Comment:  At  the  end  of  the  life  cycle  of  this  2200  MW  plant,  huge  volumes  of  low-level

disposal  facility  but  has  a  fifty  year  contract  to  dispose  of  low-level  radioactive  waste  in 
Barnwell,  South  Carolina.  All  of  the  decommissioned  low-level  radioactive  waste  and 
intermediate  level  waste  volume  will  need  to  be  trucked  to  Barnwell,  South  Carolina  at  a 
distance  of  about  661  miles.  This  will  be  a  very  expensive  disposal  operation,  and  may  equal  a 
significant  percentage  of  the  actual  cost  to  construct  the  plant.  (0020-4-11  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  This  comment  provided  no  new  information.  Decommissioning  is  discussed  in 
Chapter  6  of  the  EIS.  No  change  was  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  10-31 ;  Section  No.  10.6.2;  Footnote  (f)  of  Table  10-4  states  that  the 
conclusion  is  conditional  on  the  results  of  the  ongoing  rulemaking  to  update  the  Waste 
Confidence  Decision  and  Rule.  See  above  comment  on  updating  this  topic  in  Section  6.1.6  to 
address  the  final  rule.  This  footnote  should  be  deleted  accordingly.  (0015-7-15  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  issue  has  been  resolved  by  revisions  and  additions  made  to  Section  6.1.6  of 
the  EIS.  Footnote  T  has  been  deleted  from  Table  10-4  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  We  hope  that  the  concerns  pointed  out  by  the  Delaware  Riverkeeper,  the 
environmental  damage  inherent  in  extracting  and  purifying  uranium,  the  difficulties  in  ensuring 
that  nuclear  waste  can  be  safely  contained  for  thousands  of  years  and  the  well-documented 
pattern  of  cost-overruns  in  nuclear  plant  construction  will  encourage  the  NRC  to  subject  this 
proposal  to  the  same  rigorous  cost/benefit  analyses  applied  to  offshore  wind  and  other 
renewable  energy  projects.  (0022-13  [Butch,  Kerry  Margaret]  [King,  Charlotte]  [Pryde,  Coralie]) 

Response:  This  comment  offers  no  new  information.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Total  energy  costs  also  include  transport  and  processing  of  uranium,  hazardous, 
and  radioactive  fuels.  Additional  associated  costs  of  water  usage,  potential  accidents,  waste 
handling,  should  factor  into  feasibility  studies.  (0032-7  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Response:  The  items  described  in  this  comment  fall  outside  the  NRC's  process  for  conducting 
an  environmental  review  for  an  ESP  as  set  forth  in  10  CFR  5 1  and  52.  Because  this  comment 
does  not  provide  new  information  relevant  to  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  action, 
no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Page  No.  10-30;  Section  No.  10.6.2;  To  be  consistent  with  Section  10.2,  the 
impacts  to  cultural  resources  should  be  SMALL.  (0015-7-14  [Mallon,  James]) 

Response:  The  revision  recommended  in  the  comment  has  been  incorporated  into  Table  10-4 
in  Section  10.6.2  of  the  EIS. 

E.2.32  General  Comments  in  Support  of  the  Licensing  Action 

Comment:  So  not  only  do  we  thank  them  for  their  consideration,  we  are  encouraging  them  for 
this  consideration.  I  just  want  to  say  that  I'm  in  total  support  of  this  action.  (0004-10-4  [Acton,

Comment:  I,  therefore,  hardily  endorse  the  conclusions  in  support  of  the  NRC's  DEIS,  for  the 
proposed  PSEG  new  facilities.  (0004*12-9  [Eastman,  Alice  (Ajax)]) 

Comment:  I  believe  nuclear  power  has,  and  is,  a  necessary  part  to  play  in  our  nation's  energy 
future.  New  Jersey  and  our  nation,  like  France,  is  being  well  served  by  nuclear  power.  The 
issuance  of  PSEG's  Early  Site  Permit  is  an  important  step  to  that  end.  (0004-13-5  [Miller,  Lynn]) 

Comment:  Therefore  we  need  a  solution  as  many  plants  begin  to  close.  You  have  already 
approved  new  nuclear  sites  on  Green  field  locations  in  this  country.  And  while  there  may  be 
some  NIMBY  talk  today,  Salem  is  designed  to  be  safe  from  hurricanes,  tornadoes,  earthquakes, 
tidal  surges,  and  they  constantly  train  and  test  to  avoid  human  error.  Salem  has  reactors,  it 
holds  waste,  it  is  a  nuclear  brown  field  site.  Therefore  I  think  it  is  a  good  place  to  continue  the 
nuclear  industry.  (0004-14-4  [Moscovici,  Dan]) 

Comment:  I  have  reviewed  the  Draft  EIS  for  this  Early  Site  Permit  and  if  it  is  determined,  if  it  is 
determined,  that  this  site  has  to  be  used  for  a  new  plant,  at  some  point  in  the  future,  I'm 
confident  that  PSEG  will  work  to  avoid  as  many  impacts  as  it  can.  And  for  those  that  are 
unavoidable,  like  those  impacts  associated  with  the  footprint  of  the  buildings,  and  we  have 
heard  about  the  access  road,  or  the  causeway,  or  the  grid  stability  transmission  lines,  I'm 
confident  that  they  will  go  above  and  beyond  to  mitigate  for  these  impacts.  My  confidence 
stems  from  their  track  record,  and  the  excellent  working  relationships  that  they  have  with 
environmental  professionals  of  the  agencies,  like  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers,  U.S.  Fish 
and  Wildlife  Service,  NOAA  and,  of  course,  DEP.  And  also  the  professionals  that  are  within  the 
environmental  group  community  here  in  New  Jersey.  (0004-15-3  [McHugh,  Martin]) 

Comment:  PSEG  Power,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  have  proposed  to  add  a  fourth  nuclear  plant  on 
this  site,  one  that  could  add  up  to  another  2,200  megawatts  of  clean,  safe,  reliable  baseload 
power,  to  meet  the  increasing  demand  for  electricity  in  New  Jersey.  I'm  here  to  support  that 
proposal.  (0004-18-2  [Hufsey,  Moe]) 

Comment:  For  all  those  reasons,  to  meet  growing  demand,  to  help  clean  the  air,  and  to 
provide  good  high  quality  jobs,  I  support  PSEG’s  new  safe,  clean,  and  reliable  nuclear  power 
plant.  (0004-18-6  [Hufsey,  Moe]) 

Comment:  Sitting  there  in  the  audience,  and  listening  to  the  comments,  it  occurs  to  me  that 
those  in  favor  of  this  project,  which  I  am  one,  are  very  analytical.  (0004-19-1  [Bobbit,  John]) 

Comment:  We  have  an  opportunity  to  support  an  extraordinary  neighbor.  PSEG  has  been  an 
extraordinary  neighbor  since  they  have  arrived  in  Salem  County.  They  support  us,  they  employ 
us,  they  protect  us,  and  they  do  it  in  the  most  humble,  soft-spoken  way,  that  makes  it 
astonishingly,  that  they  are  such  a  large  and  powerful  company.  I  am  here,  once  again,  as  a 
resident,  as  a  father,  as  a  husband,  to  support  moving  forward  with  the  permit.  NRC,  I'm  very 
glad  you  are  here  to  regulate  them,  but  please  do  not  get  this  wrong.  (0004-19-3  [Bobbit,  John]) 

Comment:  Again,  on  behalf  of  the  business  community,  the  New  Jersey  State  Chamber  of 
Commerce  is  proud  to  provide  its  support  for  the  new  power  plant.  (0004-2-14  [Egenton,  Michael]) 


NUREG-2168 


E-192 


November  2015 


Appendix  E 


Comment:  I'm  here,  today,  to  express  the  State  Chamber's  support  for  the  prospect  of  having 
PSEG  build  and  operate  an  additional  nuclear  generating  plant,  on  a  site  adjacent  to  PSEG's 
existing  Hope  Creek  and  Salem  Nuclear  facility  in  Salem  County.  (0004-2-2  [Egenton,  Michael]) 

Comment:  I'm  here  today  because  I  certainly  support  the  opportunity  for  PSEG  to  apply  for  the 
site  permit  for  another  nuclear  reactor  here  in  Salem  County.  (0004-23-2  [Helder,  Jason]) 

Comment:  About  30  percent  of  the  energy  that  we  use  comes  from  this  nuclear  plant.  So  we, 
obviously,  support  this  project,  and  we  would  like  to  see  it  move  as  quickly  as  possible.  (0004- 
24-4  [Heffron,  Rich]) 

Comment:  I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  PSEG's  environmental  policy  actions  over  20 
years,  and  the  restoration  and  mitigation  activities  in  support  of  the  environment.  I  know  of  no 
company  that  has  such  a  stellar  environmental  record,  well  beyond  what  has  been  required  of 
them.  Their  environmental  restoration  activities  are  a  model  for  other  states,  and  other 
countries.  And  I  have  read  the  Environmental  Report,  and  given  what  I  know  about  their  past 
performance,  in  habitat  enhancement,  I'm  confident  that  PSEG  will  carry  out  their  plans  and 
create  much  more  habitat  than  is  compromised  by  the  new  development.  Further,  the  land  that 
will  be  used  for  siting  the  new  facility  is  not  currently  natural  high  quality  habitat.  But  it  is  already 
degraded.  But,  in  contrast,  I  feel  confidence  that  the  mitigation  habitat  will  be  functioning  high 
quality  habitat.  I  encourage  the  NRC  to  approve  the  Early  Site  Permit  and  lend  my  support  to 
PSEG  for  its  community  minded  ecosystem  conscious  approach  to  restoration  and  mitigation. 
(0004-5-1  [Burger,  Joanna]) 

Comment:  So  we  recognize  that  this  Early  Site  Permit  would  give  us  the  possibility  to  go 
ahead  and  build  another  nuclear  power  plant.  The  importance  of  it  to  us,  though,  is  that  the 
window  would  remain  open  for  20  years.  And  even  though  today,  the  economics  of  it  are 
fairly  tough,  we  really  don't  know  what  the  next  ten  years,  or  the  next  20  years  will  bring,  in  the 
impacts  on  carbon.  (0004-8-6  [Joyce,  Tom]) 

Comment:  And  we  are  in  full  support  of  their  expansion,  their  application,  and  their  remaining 
as  a  key  stakeholder,  and  leader  to  not  only  this  county,  but  this  region.  (0006-11-1  [Bailey, 
David]) 

Comment:  On  the  matter  of  expanding  I'm  definitely  in  favor.  It  would  be  great  for  our  town, 
and  it  would  be  great  for  our  town,  from  the  pizza  guy  on  the  corner,  to  the  service  station  down 
the  road,  even  to  the  resident  who  has  a  spare  room  to  rent,  to  supplement  some  income, 
during  these  times.  So  the  way  I  see  things,  it  is  pretty  clear,  everyone  will  benefit  from  more 
jobs,  from  my  township,  to  our  county,  and  to  our  state.  (0006-2-2  [Bradway.  Timothy]) 

Comment:  I  visited  the  plant,  I  have  no  concerns.  And  I  look  forward  to  the  opportunity  of 
expansion,  and  the  jobs  that  it  will  provide  this  community.  PSEG,  as  a  company,  and  its 
employees  are  community  assets.  And  they  are  vital  to  the  economic  development  of  this 
county.  (0006-3-2  [Baillie,  Joan]) 

Comment:  Again,  there  are  no  surprises,  including  our  plans  to  explore  the  construction  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant.  We  know  that  a  new  nuclear  plant  would  have  a  significant  impact  on 
the  local  community.  We  have  met  with  the  County  Freeholder  Board,  and  the  local

municipalities.  And  we  will  continue  to  work  with  the  communities  throughout  this  process.  We 
recognize  that  this  Early  Site  Permit,  and  a  possible  new  plant,  would  not  be  possible  without 
the  community's  continued  support.  (0006-5-2  [Braun,  Bob]) 

Comment:  In  light  of  the  ability  for  this  project  to  replace  a  significant  percentage  of  polluting 
fossil  energy  sources,  in  our  region,  with  reliable,  carbon-free,  generation  at  minimal  impact  on 
the  environment,  I  support  the  efforts  of  PSEG  to  expand  nuclear  generation  in  souther  New 
Jersey.  (0006-9-5  [Wiwel,  Kathy]) 

Comment:  PSEG  has  been  a  great  corporate  neighbor,  from  my  perspective.  And  certainly, 
for  the  reasons  mentioned,  I  fully  support  this  project,  with  a  great  deal  of  confidence  that  they 
will  continue  to  act,  as  I  have  experienced,  over  the  last  20  years.  (0007-1-4  [Cathead,  Richard]) 

Comment:  I  support  the  Draft  Environmental  Impact  Statement  that  the  NRC  is  presenting 
here  today.  And  I'm  a  --  I'm  actually  very  glad  for  the  choice  that  PSEG  made  for  the  location. 
And  I  live  closer  because  I'm  confident  in  the  technology,  and  I'm  confident  in  the  people  that 
are  in  the  plants.  (0007-10-2  [Clancy,  James]) 

Comment:  Many  of  the  environmental  professionals,  both  government  and  private,  have 
looked  at  this  project  inside  and  out.  And  you  have  heard  a  lot  of  testimony  today,  or  opinions, 
that  it  seems  to  be  --  not  seems,  but  is  feasible,  makes  sense,  to  move  forward,  and  the 
Chamber  is  of  a  similar  belief.  (0007-18-4  [Kleinschmidt,  Mark]) 

Comment:  So  in  conclusion,  you  know,  we  suppod  the  Draft  EIS  and  we,  also,  suppod  moving 
forward  with  the  approval  of  the  PSEG  site.  (0007-18-8  [Kleinschmidt,  Mark]) 

Comment:  PSEG  Power,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  have  proposed  to  add  a  foudh  nuclear  plant  on 
the  existing  site,  which  could  add  another  2200  megawatts  of  clean,  safe,  and  reliable  baseload 
power  to  meet  the  increasing  demand  for  electricity.  I'm  here,  today,  to  suppod  that  proposal. 
Members  of  my  family  are  here,  today,  to  suppod  that  proposal,  as  well  as  my  union  brothers. 
(0007-8-3  [Spiese,  Steve]) 

Comment:  I'm  here  to  speak  in  suppod  of  PSEG  in  their  effod  to  license  and,  ultimately, 
construct  a  new  nuclear  plant.  (0008-6-1  [Wiwel,  Kathy]) 

Comment:  I'm  here  to  suppod  the  Environmental  Impact  Statement  and  the  Early  Site  Permit 
for  the  new  nuclear  plant.  (0008-7-1  [Shaffer,  Mark]) 

Comment:  I  am  pleased  to  offer  my  comments  to  suppod  the  approval  of  the  ESP  requested 
by  PSE&G  for  construction  of  a  new,  nuclear  energy  power  plant  adjacent  to  the  two  in-service 
reactors  at  Salem  Creek.  (0009-1  [Locandro,  Roger]) 

Comment:  A  new  plant  will  provide  an  excellent  oppodunity  to  incorporate  new  technology  to 
produce  cleaner,  safer  energy  especially  ifa  cooling  tower  is  incorporated  to  significantly  reduce 
bay  water  usage,  the  impingement  and  entrainment  of  aquatic  biota,  and  the  impact  of  large 
quantities  of  elevated  temperature  water  reentering  the  estuary.  I  know  of  no  scientific  study 
that  proves  that  the  present  cooling  process  at  Salem  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  estuary.

Comment:  And  I  would  like  to  extend  my  appreciation  for  our  ability  to  provide  our  comments 
and  insight.  (0004-2-15  [Egenton,  Michael]) 

Comment:  We  commend  the  NRC's  efforts,  to  date,  for  its  thorough  analysis  in  consideration 
of  this  potential  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  site.  (0004-2-3  [Egenton,  Michael]) 

Comment:  I  want  to  thank  the  NRC  for  the  opportunity  to  speak  this  afternoon,  and  to  give  an 
opportunity  for  community  members  to  voice  their  opinion,  and  any  concerns  they  may  have. 
(0004-23-1  [Helder,  Jason]) 

Comment:  I'm  president  of  the  Delaware  State  Chamber  of  Commerce.  I'd  like  to  thank  the 
NRC  for  this  opportunity.  (0004-24-1  [Heffron,  Rich]) 

Comment:  I'm  also  first  vice  president  of  the  Maryland  Conservation  Council,  and  on  behalf  of 
the  group  I  would  like  to  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak,  here,  today.  (0004-6-1  [Meadow,

Comment:  On  behalf  of  PSEG  I  really  do  look  forward  to  all  of  the  comments  today,  so  that  we 
get  a  better  understanding  of  the  community's  outlook  on  what  it  is  that  we  are  proposing  to  do. 
(0004-8-1  [Joyce,  Tom]) 

Comment:  Thank  you  very  much  for  this  opportunity  to  speak.  (0004-9-1  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Comment:  On  behalf  of  PSEG  we  look  forward  to  this  evening's  public  meeting  and  the 
opportunity  to  continue  working  with  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission,  and  the  public,  on  our 
application  for  an  Early  Site  Permit,  as  we  explore  the  possibility  of  building  a  new  nuclear  plant 
here  in  Salem  County.  (0006-5-1  [Braun,  Bob]) 

Comment:  And  I  have  to  say,  in  looking  over  the  EIS  statement  prepared  by  NRC,  and  the 
Army  Corps  of  Engineers,  does  a  really  nice  job  of  identifying  the  environmental  impacts,  and 
potential  environmental  impacts,  of  the  PSEG  project.  (0006-6-1  [DeLuca,  Mike])

Comment:  So  I  have  reviewed  the  Draft  EIS,  particularly  with  respect  to  environmental  impacts 
and,  especially,  wetland  impacts.  And  I  do  believe  that  the  potential  and  obvious  wetland 
impacts  have  been  addressed  in  a  very  satisfactory  manner.  (0007-17-2  [DeLuca,  Mike])

[Kleinschmidt,  Mark]) 

Comment:  The  approval  process  for  the  expansion  at  the  Hope  Creek  site,  or  any  nuclear  site, 
is  very  extensive.  And  I  don't  think  there  is  any  industry,  or  any  activity,  that  is  more  regulated 
and  looked  at,  in  more  detail,  than  the  siting  and  the  permitting  of  a  nuclear  power  plant.  A  lot  of 
the  issues,  with  the  siting,  have  been  taken  care  of,  because  the  plant  has  been  there  for  a 
number  of  years.  (0007-18-2  [Kleinschmidt,  Mark]) 

Comment:  Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  speak.  (0007-2-1  [Carter,  David])

opportunity  to  speak  here  today.  (0007-6-1  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  We  concluded  that  the  review  team  has  done  an  excellent  job  in  producing  the 
Draft  Environmental  Impact  Statement,  especially  by  thoroughly  describing  the  great  disparity 
between  nuclear  power  and  the  renewables,  in  the  relative  area  of  habitat  that  they  will  impact. 
(0007-6-2  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  On  behalf  of  PSEG  Nuclear,  we  look  forward  to  today's  public  meetings,  and  the 
opportunity  to  continue  to  work  with  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission,  and  the  public,  on  our

about  today.  As  I  was  involved  with  managing  that  effort,  as  well.  We  considered  and 
evaluated  the  potential  impacts  and  benefits,  to  Delaware  residents,  as  the  NRC  has  document 
in  the  Draft  EIS.  And  I  know,  firsthand,  that  the  advice,  guidance,  and  inputs  from  the  Delaware 
Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environmental  Control,  the  other  Delaware  regulatory

E.2.34  General  Comments  in  Support  of  Nuclear  Power 

Comment:  While  I  am  not  an  expert  in  energy  generation,  there  is  no  question  that  the  future 
welfare  of  human  society  depends  on  reducing  energy  use  and  developing  zero  carbon  sources 
of  energy.  Many  experts  have  indicated  that  nuclear  power  represents  a  viable  alternative  in 
the  short  term  and  must  be  part  of  any  mix  of  conservation  and  new  energy  sources  that  are 
used  to  make  the  transition  to  a  zero  carbon  future.  (0001-10  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Comment:  While  I'm  not  an  expert  in  energy  generation,  there  is  no  question  that  the  future 
welfare  of  human  society  depends  on  reducing  energy  use,  and  developing  zero  carbon 
sources  of  energy.  Many  experts  have  indicated  that  nuclear  power  represents  a  viable 
alternative,  in  the  short  term,  and  must  be  part  of  the  mix  of  conservation,  and  new  energy 
sources  that  are  used  to  make  transition  to  a  zero  carbon  future.  (0004-11-10  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Comment:  I  was,  formerly,  a  staunch  opponent  of  nuclear  power,  especially  following  the 
Three  Mile  Island  episode.  But  that  position  changed  after  I  became  an  intervenor  in  the 
proposed  wind  installations  along  the  ridges  of  the  Appalachian  Mountains  in  Western 
Maryland.  I  learned  the  truth  about  the  many  down  sides  of  industrial  wind.  And,  at  the  same 
time,  learned  that  my  opposition  to  nuclear  energy  was  based  on  my  ignorance  of  it.  Dr. 

Norman  Meadow,  and  William  Biggley  both  helped  to  dispel  that  ignorance.  And  I  have,  since, 
become  a  strong  supporter  of  nuclear  energy,  as  the  most  environmentally  sensitive  solution  to 
our  energy  needs.  (0004-12-1  [Eastman,  Alice  (Ajax)]) 

Comment:  These  and  many  other  problems  of  unreliability,  non-firm  production  electricity,  the 
enormous  amount  of  land  and  sea  required,  greater  costs,  shorter  life  spans,  in  comparison  with 
nuclear  energy  are  why  I'm  committed  to  favoring  nuclear  energy.  (0004-12-8  [Eastman,  Alice 
(Ajax)]) 

Comment:  I  believe  nuclear  power  has,  and  is,  a  necessary  part  to  play  in  our  nation's  energy 
future.  New  Jersey  and  our  nation,  like  France,  is  being  well  served  by  nuclear  power.  (0004- 
13-4  [Miller,  Lynn]) 

Comment:  I  have  been  a  big  fan  of  nuclear  power,  since  I  started  working  at  Westinghouse, 
back  in  the  mid  early  70s,  I  worked  at  the,  right  over,  just  on  the  other  side  of  the  river,  on  the 
condensers,  feedwater  heaters,  water  coolers,  moisture  separator  reheaters,  all  the  heat 
transfer  equipment  on  fossil  nuclear  plants.  I  became  convinced,  after  visiting  a  lot  of  fossil  and

Appendix  E 

nuclear  plants,  that  nuclear  is  the  only  way  to  go.  Coal  is  so  dirty,  natural  gas  is  better,  but  it  is 
not  the  long  term  solution.  (0004-17-2  [Osborn,  Sam]) 

Comment:  Nuclear  energy  continues  to  be  an  important  part  of  America’s,  and  New  Jersey's 
diverse  energy  portfolio,  providing  reliable  baseload  electricity  around  the  clock.  Nuclear 
generation  provides  nearly  20  percent  of  our  country's  electricity  and  more  than  half  of  the 
electricity  used  in  New  Jersey.  (0004-2-4  [Egenton,  Michael]) 

Comment:  While  there  has  been  considerable  public  dialogue  and  debate,  about  the  use  and 
benefits  of  nuclear  power,  no  one  can  argue  that  nuclear  power  is  the  largest  source  of 
electricity  that  does  not  emit  any  air  pollution.  (0004-2-5  [Egenton,  Michael]) 

Comment:  Additionally,  the  business  community  recognizes  that  the  first  commercial  nuclear 
power  plant,  in  the  United  States,  located  here  in  New  Jersey,  Oyster  Creek,  is  now  scheduled 
to  be  decommissioned  and  retired  in  2019,  making  the  urgency  of  a  new  nuclear  generating 
facility  that  much  more  critical.  (0004-2-8  [Egenton,  Michael]) 

Comment:  How  safe  is  it  to  work  at  PSEG  Nuclear?  I  get  asked  that  question  from  my  family 
and  friends.  And  also  the  question,  are  you  scared  to  work  there?  Being  an  environmentalist, 
and  an  outdoor  enthusiast,  having  environmental  science  degree  and  a  civil  engineering 
degree,  I  can  honestly  answer  it  is  safe  to  work  at  a  nuclear  generating  stations.  (0004-20-1 
[Timberman,  Tanya]) 

Comment:  So  three  critical  questions,  conclusions,  can  be  drawn  from  this  understanding. 

The  first  is  that  we  must  reach  zero  carbon  dioxide  emissions  as  soon  as  possible.  Because 
what  is  emitted  this  year  is  going  to  be  with  us  for  a  good  millenium,  or  more.  We  don't  have 
time  to  wait  for  ancillary  technologies,  like  energy  storage  and  a  number  of  other  things  to  be 
developed.  Nuclear  power  can  do  that  right  now.  (0004-6-6  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  The  third  conclusion,  that  the  National  Academies  of  Science  reached  is  that 
nuclear  power  must  be  used  as  an  essential  component  for  producing  carbon  free  primary 
energy.  Nuclear  power  can  also  be  used  for  industrial  process  heat,  as  well  as  heat  for 
buildings,  whereas  wind  cannot,  and  solar  installations,  in  deserts,  cannot  supply  heat  to 
industrial  or  population  centers.  (0004-6-8  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  The  following  quote  is  from  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences,  referred  to  the  need 
for  nuclear  power  to  combat  global  warming.  (1 )  U.S.  nuclear  power  plants  were  responsible 
for,  approximately,  70  percent  of  the  greenhouse  gas  free  electricity  production  in  the  United 
States.  The  existing  plants  are  likely  to  continue  to  contribute  significantly.  However,  after  2035 
if  significant  new  construction  has  taken  place,  during  the  preceding  15  years,  the  greenhouse 
gas  emissions  reduction  could  be  substantial.  (2)  We  thus  conclude  that  is  an  urgent  need  for 
U.S.  action  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  In  response  to  this  need  for  action  we 
recommend  policies  to,  among  other  things,  establish  new  generation  nuclear  technologies.  (3) 
Nuclear  power  is  one  of  the  key  options  for  meeting  large  scale  electricity  demand  without 
producing  greenhouse  gases.  (4)  Nuclear  power  is  an  established  technology  that  could  meet  a 
significant  portion  of  the  world’s  energy  needs.  France  obtains,  roughly,  79  percent  of  its

Appendix  E 


electricity  from  nuclear  sources.  About  20  percent  of  U.S.  electricity  comes  from  nuclear 
reactors,  by  far  the  largest  source  of  greenhouse  gas-free  energy.  (0004-7-2  [Meadow,  Karen]) 

Comment:  Therefore  we  feel  building  more  nuclear  reactors,  as  quickly  as  possible,  is 
essential  to  the  long-term  viability  of  human  society,  and  the  biological  world.  (0004-7-5 
[Meadow,  Karen]) 

Comment:  I  would  recommend  this  industry  to  anyone  and  I  do.  I  feel  like  I'm  getting  valuable 
skills  in  an  important  industry,  and  look  forward  to  coming  to  work,  every  day,  because  I  know 
that  I  can  take  pride  in  my  work,  and  that  it  is  appreciated.  (0006-10-2  [Barch,  Alexander]) 

Comment:  Therefore  we  feel  building  more  nuclear  power  reactors,  as  quickly  as  possible,  is 
essential  to  the  long-term  viability  of  human  society,  and  the  biological  world.  (0007-6-11 
[Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  And,  third,  that  nuclear  power  must  be  used  as  an  essential  component  for 
producing  carbon-free  energy.  This  is  the  National  Academy  saying  this.  (0007-6-7  [Meadow, 
Norman]) 

Comment:  We  believe,  therefore,  that  the  best  course  to  reach  zero  emissions,  as  soon  as 
possible,  because  carbon  dioxide  emitted  this  year  will  still  be  having  an  effect  on  climate  for 
several  millennia.lt  is  clear  that  carbon  dioxide,  from  gas  turbines,  will  have  to  end.  Electricity 
accounts  for  only  about  40  percent  of  our  carbon  dioxide  emissions. But  nuclear  power  can  and, 
also  be  used  for  industrial  process  heat,  and  heating  buildings,  whereas  wind  power  cannot. 

And  solar  installations  in  deserts  cannot  supply  heat  to  industrial  or  population  centers.  (0007-6- 
9  [Meadow,  Norman]) 

Comment:  Nuclear  power  is  the  only  clean  fuel  that  I  know  that  we  have,  that  we  can  rely  on, 
today  and  tomorrow.  And  if  you  don't  think  that  nuclear  fuel,  nuclear  power  hasn't  been  around 
for  a  long  time,  then  you  have  a  big  problem,  in  that  are  breathing  the  oxygen  in  the  air,  that  is 
being  held  here,  by  the  magnetic  fields,  because  we  stand  on  top  of  a  nuclear  power  plant.  It  is 
the  reason  that  we  have  a  molten  core  in  our  world,  and  it  is  the  reason  that  we  have  magnetic 
fields,  and  the  Vanallen  belts,  and  we  have  maintained  an  environment  here.  (0008-10-4 
[Deschere,  Mark]) 

Comment:  But  if  we  don't  go  forward  with  these  things,  we  are  selling  our  grandchildren  down 
the  road.  And  that  is  not  something  that  I  consider  acceptable.  So,  do  I  support  nuclear  power? 
Absolutely.  Am  I  steeped  in  nuclear  power?  Yes,  I  am.  Did  I  start  out  that  way?  No,  I  didn't. 

But  I  have  been  close  to  this  industry.  This  is  an  industry  that  really  does  take  what  they  are 
doing  seriously.  (0008-10-5  [Deschere,  Mark]) 

Comment:  For  those  of  you  that  continue  to  have  reservations  about  new  nuclear  power  plant, 
or  nuclear  energy  in  general,  I  encourage  you  take  advantage.  PSEG  operates  an  energy  and 
environmental  resource  center  over  in  Salem,  New  Jersey.  And  there  you  can  find  a  wealth  of 
information  about  nuclear  power,  and  other  energy  sources.  (0008-2-12  [Evans,  Brenda]) 

Comment:  I  strongly  support  nuclear  power  as  a  safe,  reliable,  source  of  energy.  (0008-2-4

Comment:  I  believe  we  need  nuclear  power.  As  of  today  20  percent  of  all  electricity, 
generated  in  this  nation,  comes  from  the  100-plus  nuclear  reactors  spread  out  among  the 
continental  United  States.  If  you  want  this  nation  to  have  all  of  the  above  energy  profile,  nuclear 
power  has  to  be  included.  If  you  want  to  have  reduced  greenhouse  gases,  in  the  future,  nuclear 
power  must  be  included.  For,  as  I  know,  there  are  no  emissions  from  nuclear  power.  (0008-3-2 
[Willis,  Martin]) 

Comment:  We  need  nuclear  power  and  from  what  I'm  hearing  tonight,  I'm  very  encouraged, 
and  thank  you  for  letting  me  have  my  comments.  (0008-3-5  [Willis,  Martin]) 

Comment:  I  believe  nuclear  power  is  an  extremely  important  resource  if  we  are  going  to  meet 
the  climate  change  requirements,  if  we  are  going  to  stop  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  (0008- 
7-2  [Shaffer,  Mark]) 

Comment:  Nuclear  energy  now  supplies  over  50%  of  our  state's  energy  needs  and  it  is 
recognized  as  an  efficient,  clean,  low  carbon  form  of  energy  production.  We  are  pleased  to  see 
the  change  to  an  efficient,  clean,  low  carbon  form  of  energy  production,  as  needs  for  energy 
continue  to  grow  in  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  (0009-2  [Locandro,  Roger]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  support  for  nuclear  power  in  general.  These  comments 
do  not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed

E.2.35  General  Comments  in  Support  of  the  Applicant  and/or  the  Existing  Plant 

Comment:  For  over  20  years  the  Academy  [of  Natural  Sciences  of  Drexel  University]  has  acted 
in  an  advisory  capacity  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  impact  of  various  PSEG  projects  on  the 
Delaware  Estuary.  In  that  role  we  have  done  extensive  research  on  the  physical  and  biological 
characteristics  of  the  Delaware  Estuary,  including  components  of  the  PSEG  Estuarine 
Enhancement  Program.  We  have  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  PSEG  make  substantive 
steps  to  reduce  their  environmental  impact  and  to  operate  within  the  constraints  of  the  local 
ecosystem.  They  are  a  very  responsible  partner  in  the  study  and  use  of  the  Delaware  estuary. 
(0001-1  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Comment:  Let  me  conclude  by  saying  that  I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  PSEG's 
operations  for  a  number  of  years,  and  I'm  impressed  by  their  willingness  to  respond  to 
environmental  constraints  in  their  planning.  They  have  embraced  ecological  science  as  a 
planning  tool  for  engineering  and  have  been  proactive  in  seeking  the  guidance  of  experts  to 
reduce  their  environmental  impacts.  The  EEP  represents  a  long  term  commitment  to  the  region 
and  its  natural  resources,  and  I  would  expect  that  commitment  to  continue  with  the  proposed 
new  construction.  (0001-11  [Velinsky,  David])

impacts  on  the  ecology  and  biodiversity  of  the  region,  and  has  made  important  contributions  to 
the  recreational  and  educational  opportunities  available  to  the  local  communities.  The  scale

and  scope  of  the  effort  has  supported  large  scale  scientific  research  and  has  improved  our 
understanding  of  the  process  of  environmental  restoration.  (0001-5  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Comment:  Having  worked  with  PSEG  personnel  since  1994  on  various  aspects  of  the  Estuary 
Enhancement  Program,  and  witnessed  first-hand,  a  willingness  and  commitment  to  doing  the 
"right  thing",  and  to  be  diligent  and  rigorous  in  their  efforts  to  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  of  the 
project  on  natural  resources.  More  than  50  specialists  in  ecology,  design  and  construction  of 
coastal  wetlands  have  participated  in  implementing  and/or  evaluating  the  EEP  during  the  last 
two  decades.  This  is  EcoSocietal  Restoration  at  its  best  -  Rigorous  science  and  a  very 
meaningful  and  practical  outcome!  (0002-7  [Weinstein,  Michael])

improved  our  understanding  of  the  process  of  environmental  restoration.  (0004-11-5  [Velinsky, 
David]) 

Comment:  The  Water  Resources  Association  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  (WRA)  recognizes 
that  PSEG  has  demonstrated  a  long-standing  commitment  to  the  environment,  and  to  their 
credit,  they  have  been  a  national  leader  in  the  electric  utility  industry  for  emphasizing 
environmentally  sustainable  solutions  for  operations.  (0004-16-12  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  So  it  was  said  earlier,  to  hold  PSEG's  feet  to  the  fire  and  they  will  come  through.  I 
would  even  amend  that  to  say  that  they've  always  been  true  community  partners  and  you  don't 
even  need  to  hold  their  feet  to  the  fire,  you  engage  them  in  conversation,  and  they  will  willingly 
work  with  you  to  improve  the  situation  for  all.  Just  to  make  the  point  of  how  this  isn't  an  aloof 
industry,  this  is  a  true  industry  that  always  engages  with  its  community.  I  can  tell  you,  over  the 
past  -  a  little  over  ten  years,  Joe  Barton,  Joe  DelMar,  Mike  Coil,  we  know  them  by  name.  And

that  is  not  always  the  case.  So  I'm  here  to  just  commend  a  tremendous  community  partner  in 
PSEG.  (0004-21-2  [Pierson,  Helene]) 

Comment:  And  with  their  support  we  have  brought  almost  700  students,  from  Southern  New 
Jersey,  through  these  programs.  Many  of  whom  now  are  looking  and  seeing  that  the  first  group 
of  these  students  are  now  coming  through  Rowan  as  engineering  students,  as  well  as  enrolling 
in  a  number  of  engineering  schools  throughout  the  region.  So  we  are  very  happy  to  have  that 
support.  And,  certainly,  without  that  support,  we  wouldn't  be  able  to  offer  that  program  nearly 
free  of  cost,  to  any  student  who  wants  to  attend  in  the  region.  And  with  their  support  we  hope  to 
double  the  number  of  students  that  we  have  been  bringing  through  these  programs.  So  while  a 
lot  of  the  companies  in  the  region  have  spoken  the  right  words,  and  said  we  are  going  to 
support  it,  we  need  these  future  students  to  become  our  workforce  down  the  road,  they  really 
put  their  money  where  their  mouth  is.  (0004-22-1  [Lowman,  Anthony]) 

Comment:  And  they  sponsor  our  clinic  projects,  no  matter  if  it  is  something  of  interest  to  their 
company,  or  not,  it  is  for  the  training  of  our  students.  These  projects  range  from  some  that  have 
been  of  interest  to  their  program,  such  as  using  an  engineering  design  team  to  help  solve  a 
flooding  problem  in  their  parking  lot,  to  wetlands  restoration,  to  remediation.  We  use  money  for 
remediation  after  hurricane  Sandy.  To  students  working  on  projects  related  to  peripheral  nerve 
growth  for  developing  artificial  medical  devices.  So  their  support  has  gone  a  long  way  to 
helping  us  train  engineers.  I  think  last  I  would  just  like  to  say,  you  know,  I  think  it  is  important  to 
have  a  partner  like  that  in  the  region,  as  an  engineering  school.  They  help  us  train  our  students, 
they  help  us  drive  the  directions  of  our  programs,  and  it  is  -I  think  they  are  great  for  our  region. 
And  certainly  what  they  do,  going  forward,  is  going  to  be  a  benefit  to  all.  (0004-22-2  [Lowman, 
Anthony]) 

Comment:  PSEG  not  only  stops  at  the  college  level,  but  they  have  been  absolutely 
instrumental  in  preparing  students,  at  a  high  school  level,  for  careers  in  nuclear  engineering, 
and  for  a  multitude  of  jobs  down  at  PSEG.  They  were  instrumental  in  the  creation  of  an 
Academy  for  Nuclear  Applications  and  Energy  Applications  at  the  technical  high  school.  And 
when  I  say  instrumental,  not  jus  that  there  was  an  idea,  and  they  proposed  it  to  us,  and  we  put 
together  our  program.  They  helped  us  write  a  curriculum,  and  build  a  program  that  is  rooted  in 
safety,  that  is  rooted  in  benefit  to  high  school  students.  And  it  is  a  great  program.  We  have 
produced  students  in  each  of  the  last  two  graduating  classes,  that  are  now  engineering  students 
at  Rowan  University,  taking  part  in  some  of  the  programs  that  were  just  mentioned.  (0004-23-4 
[Helder,  Jason]) 

Comment:  They  have  also  been  very  impactful  to  the  program  that  is  now  offered,  right  here, 
on  campus  here  at  Salem  Community  College,  in  a  nuclear  engineering  program,  to  prepare 
students.  PSEG  is  very  thoughtful  in  how  they  go  about  this.  They  have  an  energy  resource 
center  that  is  available  to  students  of  all  ages,  here  in  Salem  County.  Its  doors  are  always 
open.  It  is  presented  in  a  way  that  makes  energy  conservation,  and  safety,  very  real  to  young 
children,  elementary,  middle,  and  high  school.  (0004-23-5  [Helder,  Jason]) 

Comment:  At  PSEG  we  understand  our  obligation  to  the  local  community,  the  environment, 
and  our  friends,  families,  coworkers,  to  provide  safe,  reliable,  economic  and  green  energy.  We 
operate  our  plants  with  a  culture  of  safety  and  transparency.  We  encourage  all  of  our

employees  to  raise  issues,  and  to  be  open,  on  how  we  can  do  things  better.  It  seems  like  when 
we  really  look  at  it,  no  matter  what  it  is  that  we  do,  there  are  always  lessons  learned  so  that 
tomorrow  we  can  do  it  just  a  little  bit  better.  There  are  no  surprises,  not  in  our  operations  and, 
certainly,  not  with  our  stakeholders.  There  is  no  nuclear,  no  new  nuclear,  without  good  old 
nuclear.  Every  time  that  there  is  an  upset  condition,  in  the  nuclear  industry,  it  is  really  going  to 
impact  the  ability  to  build  any  new  power  plants.  (0004-8-2  [Joyce,  Tom]) 

Comment:  Having  worked  with  PSEG  personnel  since  1984,  in  various  aspects  of  the  EEP, 
and  witnessed  first-hand,  a  willingness  and  commitment  to  do  the  right  thing,  and  to  be  diligent 
and  rigorous  in  their  efforts  to  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  of  the  project,  on  natural  resources. 
More  than  50  specialists  in  ecology,  design,  and  construction  of  coastal  wetlands  have 
participated  in  implementing  and/or  evaluating  the  EEP,  still  on  an  ongoing  basis,  during  the  last 
two  decades.  I  had  the  quote  about  ecological,  ecosocietal  restoration,  and  I  just  will  say  that 
this  is  one  of  the  best  examples  I  can  cite  of  ecosocietal  restoration.  (0004-9-8  [Weinstein, 
Michael]) 

Comment:  PSEG  and  the  Lower  Alloway's  Creek  Township,  have  a  great  relationship,  and  we 
strive  to  keep  it  this  way.  We  are  always  kept,  well-informed,  by  PSEG  employees,  at  our 
monthly  township  meetings,  in  the  emergency  management  room,  and  numerous  phone  calls, 
in  between  times.  During  these  meetings,  and  phone  calls,  there  was  at  no  time  that  I  have 
ever  felt  that  PSEG  was  not  being  transparent,  with  me,  or  the  township.  PSEG  does  a  very 
good  job  explaining  everything,  to  the  committee  members,  and  myself  and  in  a  respectful  way. 
In  my  opinion  PSEG  has  done  so  much  for  our  town.  Just  to  name  a  few  things,  the  countless 
number  of  residents  that  are  currently,  and  past,  employees  of  PSEG.  The  community 
outreach,  training,  and  awareness,  is  above  and  beyond  all  the  rest.  Not  only  the  jobs  at  PSEG, 
but  the  jobs  our  township  currently  has,  we  can  thank  PSEG  for  playing  a  part  in  creating.  For 
example,  our  police  department,  our  municipal  fire  department,  and  several  other  small 
businesses,  as  well.  I  definitely  feel  PSEG  has  made  a  positive  impact  on  our  town.  (0006-2-1 
[Bradway,  Timothy]) 

Comment:  We  have  been  involved,  the  Division  has  been  involved  with  that  program,  has 
been  observing  it,  has  made  comment  on  it  from  the  time  that  it  was  originally  started.  And  the 
one  thing  we  have  seen,  time  and  again,  is  that  PSEG  has  done  a  very  good  job  of  doing  what 
is  right,  for  the  environment,  in  those  situations.  And  they  have  brought  in  people  who  can  do 
the  job  right.  I  have  witnessed,  many  cases,  where  there  were  arguments,  with  some  of  the 
people  that  PSEG  had  hired.  And  once  that  became,  went  out  into  the  public,  they  soon  moved 
that  person  to  another  job,  in  order  to  make  sure  that  things  would  move  smoothly.  They  hired 
some  of  the  best  people  they  could  get.  And  those  people  have  made  sure  that  the  project  has 
gone  along  well.  (0006-7-5  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Comment:  We  have  worked  with  PSEG  for  many  years  taking  advantage  of  the  huge  marsh 
restoration  program  they've  put  in  place,  along  the  shores  of  Delaware  Bay.  We  used  the 
restored  marsh  habitats  as  living  classrooms  for  field  programs  we  present  to  a  wide  array  of 
audience.  PSEG  has  supported  our  access,  to  these  sites,  and  worked  together  with  us  to 
facilitate  our  ability  to  conveniently  use  these  habitats  for  education  purposes.  We  have 
programs,  in  place,  that  engage  under-served  teams  in  water  quality  monitoring  activities, 
upstream,  in  the  urbanized  parts  of  the  Delaware  River  watershed.  And  it  is  great  to  be  able  to

compare  these  urban  environments  to  productive  salt  marsh  habitats  further  downstream. 
(0006-8-1  [Duvau,  Bryan]) 

Comment:  I  believe  that  PSEG  is  a  good  steward  of  the  environment,  as  well  as  the  electric 
resource  needs  of  the  regions.  They  have  demonstrated  strong  leadership,  in  support  of 
restoration  programs,  throughout  the  state,  and  have  collaborated  with  a  large  group  of 
environmental  organizations  to  preserve  and  improve  coastal  resources.  I  look  forward  to 
continuing  to  work  with  them  to  create  opportunities  for  impactful  education  programming  for  the 
benefit  of  the  region  as  a  whole.  (0006-8-10  [Duvau,  Bryan]) 

Comment:  PSEG  has  consistently  demonstrated  their  commitment  to  environmental 
stewardship  through  programs  like  these.  In  addition  PSEG  plays  an  important  leadership  role 
in  the  Federal  Coastal  America  Program,  which  is  dedicated  to  improving  coastal  and  estuarine 
habitats  throughout  the  country.  (0006-8-3  [Duvau,  Bryan]) 

Comment:  In  New  Jersey  PSEG  plays  a  major  leadership  role  in  the  corporate  wetlands 
restoration  partnership,  and  the  New  Jersey  CWRP  is  consistently  held  up  as  a  model  of  a 
successful  application  of  this  type  of  collaboration  within  coastal  America.  There  is  no  way  this 
would  be  the  case  if  not  for  PSEG's  strong  leadership  of  the  effort.  (0006-8-4  [Duvau,  Bryan]) 

Comment:  In  all  of  my  interactions,  with  the  officials  at  PSEG,  I  have  always  found  them  willing 
to  work  closely  with  the  State  of  Delaware  and,  just  recently,  the  City  of  Delaware  City.  These 
interactions  include  a  program  that  improved  the  estuary,  by  restoring  sites,  and  installing  some 
fish  ladders.  They  have  always  provided  real  dollars  to  help  other  habitat  and  wetland 
restorations.  It  is  my  experience  that  PSEG  understands  the  importance  of  its  Delaware 
neighbor,  and  they  strive  to  ensure  that  the  Delaware  Emergency  Management  Agency,  as  well 
as  the  Delaware  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environmental  Control,  the  City  of 
Delaware  City,  state  and  federal  officials,  are  well  informed  about  the  operations  of  their  existing 
nuclear  units.  (0007-1-1  [Cathcart,  Richard]) 

Comment:  When  we  worked  with  PSEG,  and  I  remember  PSEG  more  than  any  others, 
because  I  worked  with  them  for  such  a  long  time.  And  the  fact  that  they  were  more  unique  than 
all  the  other  ones.  When  it  came  to  working  with  them,  as  far  as  getting  the  permits  done,  and 
doing  it  right,  they  were  always  there  to  make  the  changes  that  were  necessary.  (0007-14-1 
[Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Comment:  I  started  back  well  over  20  years  ago,  we  started  working  on  the  Estuary 
Enhancement  Program.  They  came  to  the  state  and  said,  here,  we  would  like  to  do  this  as  an 
alternative  to  doing  actually  hard  construction.  The  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  in 
New  Jersey  decided  that  was  a  reasonable  alternative,  and  put  New  Jersey  Fish  and  Wildlife, 
and  the  Marine  Fisheries,  basically  in  charge  of  overseeing  what  was  going  on  with  PSEG.  As 
we  worked  with  them  we  found  out  that  they  were  paying  close  attention  to  what  it  was  going  to 
do  to  the  environment.  And  their  proposals  were,  basically,  very  positive  for  the  environment. 
(0007-14-2  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Comment:  As  a  result  we  have  had,  now,  well  over  20  years  that  we  have  been  working  on  the 
Estuary  Enhancement  Program  that  PSEG  has  worked  on.  This  program  has  ended  up

Appendix  E 


providing  thousands  of  acres  of  wetland  enhancement  for  fish,  wildlife,  and  for  the  general 
public  here  in  Delaware  and  New  Jersey.  And  when  I  discussed  this  issue  with  some  of  the 
people  who  have  been  involved,  for  years,  as  permit  reviewers,  the  one  thing  that  comes  out  is 
that  this  project  was  the  one  project  that  they  would  look  at,  and  they  could  look  back  at  their 
career  and  say,  this  is  a  project  that  we  actually  did  something  positive  for  the  environment. 
(0007-14-3  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Comment:  [l]f  you  happen  to  do  environmental  impact  reviews,  people  who  are  applying  these 
already  know  they  are  going  to  get  something.  It  is  very  seldom  that  they  come  in  there  that 
they  don't  have  most  of  their  Is  dotted  and  Ts  crossed.  They  may  not  get  all  of  what  they  want, 
but  they  are  going  to  get  something.  Yet  the  reviewers  have  taken  this  job  on,  from  the 
beginning,  figuring  that  they  were  actually  going  to  provide  some  protection  for  the  environment. 
And  what  they  found  was  that  all  they  are  doing  is  putting  off.  And  what  wasn't  developed  today 
comes  back  a  couple  of  years  later.  We  have  had  some  that  came  back  15  years  later.  And 
they  would  find,  you  would  hear  their  little  comments  like,  oh  it  is  the  same  guys  that  are  still 
here.  Which  meant  we  turned  them  down  the  first  time.  And  we  turned  them  down  again.  But 
with  PSEG  we  didn't  have  that  problem.  And  all  of  these  reviewers  that  were  involved  in  the 
PSEG  program  say  that  this  project  has  been  one  of  the  best,  as  far  as  getting  something 
actually  positively  done  for  the  environment.  So  when  it  comes  to  commitment,  I'd  like  to  point 
out  that  PSEG  has  always  been,  and  it  looks  like  it  will  continue  to  be  committed  to  doing  the 
best  for  the  environment.  (0007-14-4  [Widjeskog,  Lee]) 

Comment:  The  Water  Resources  Association  of  the  Delaware  River  recognizes  that  PSEG  has 
demonstrated  a  long-standing  commitment  to  the  environment,  and  to  their  credit  has  been  a 
national  leader,  in  the  electric  utility  industry,  for  emphasizing  environmentally  sustainable 
solutions  to  their  operations.  (0007-16-11  [Palmer,  Dennis]) 

Comment:  And  I,  generally,  don't  testify  on  behalf  of  permit  applications.  I  do  this  very  rarely. 
I've  only  done  it  a  few  times.  And  each  time  that  I  have  done  it  has  been  on  behalf  of  the  same 
company,  PSEG.  And  that  is  what  compelled  me  to  be  here  today.  I  do  believe  the  company 
has  a  very  strong  environmental  ethic.  And  this  is  a  key  part  of  the  corporate  culture  at  PSEG, 
something  you  just  don't  see  in  the  corporate  community  very  often.  (0007-17-1  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Comment:  Also,  as  previous  speakers  have  mentioned,  PSEG  has  a  lot  of  expertise  with 
respect  to  wetlands,  wetlands  restoration,  mitigation  of  impacts  on  wetlands.  And  this  comes, 
most  notably,  from  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program,  which  was  instituted  in  the  mid-1990s, 
perhaps  one  of  the  largest  restoration  programs  undertaken  for  wetlands  in  our  nation,  on  the 
order  of  20,000  acres.  That  was  a  very,  very  strong  success,  and  led  to  increased  productivity 
in  a  variety  of  fin  fish,  and  restored  tidal  function  to  a  great  vast  expanse  of  wetlands  in  the 
Delaware  estuary  system.  So  no  one  disputes  that  there  will  be  impacts.  But,  certainly,  I 
believe  this  company  has  the  capacity,  and  the  expertise,  to  deal  very  effectively  with  these. 
(0007-17-3  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Comment:  At  PSEG  Nuclear  we  understand  our  obligation  to  the  local  community,  the 
environment,  our  friends,  and  coworkers,  and  to  provide  safe,  reliable,  and  economical,  and 
green  energy.  We  operate  our  plants  in  a  culture  of  safety  and  transparency.  We  encourage 
our  employees  to  raise  issues,  and  to  be  open  in  how  we  can  do  things  better.  There  are 


NUREG-2168

Appendix  E 


always  lessons  to  be  learned.  Our  success  is  made  possible  by  our  employees.  There  are  no 
surprises,  not  in  our  operations  and,  certainly,  not  with  our  stakeholders.  There  is  no  new 
nuclear  without  good  old  nuclear.  (0007-7-2  [Eilola,  Ed]) 

Comment:  For  over  20  years  the  Academy  [of  Natural  Sciences  at  Drexel  University]  has  acted 
in  an  advisory  capacity,  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  impacts  of  various  PSEG  projects  on  the 
Delaware  estuary.  In  that  role  we  have  done  extensive  research  on  the  physical  and  biological 
characteristics  of  the  Delaware  estuary,  including  components  of  the  PSEG  Estuary 
Enhancement  Program.  We  have  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  PSEG  make  substantial 
steps,  or  substantive  and  substantial  steps,  to  reduce  the  environmental  impact  and  operate 
within  the  constraints  of  the  local  ecosystem.  (0007-9-1  [Wall,  Roland]) 

Comment:  The  Academy  [of  Natural  Sciences  at  Drexel  University]  commends  PSEG  for  its 
demonstrated  initiative,  and  long  term  commitment,  to  restoring  the  critical  wetlands  of  the 
Delaware  estuary.  The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  has  had  numerous  positive  impacts  on 
the  ecology,  and  biodiversity  of  the  region,  and  has  made  important  contributions  to 
recreational,  and  educational  opportunities  available  to  the  local  communities.  The  scale  and 
scope  of  the  effort  has  supported  large  scale  scientific  research,  and  has  improved  our 
understanding  of  the  processes  of  environmental  restoration.  (0007-9-5  [Wall,  Roland]) 

Comment:  I  wanted  to  focus  on,  and  shed  some,  what  I  call  insider's  light,  in  how  PSEG 
conducts  their  day  to  day  environmental  business.  One  example  of  that  was  the  implementation 
of  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  in  both  New  Jersey  and  Delaware.  During  the  planning 
for  this  program,  and  the  field  work,  over  the  last  20  years,  the  PSEG  team  I  managed  focused 
on  making  sure  that  there  was  a  sound  scientific  basis  for  our  decisionmaking.  Whether  that 
was  in  the  design  of  the  many  aquatic  biological  monitoring  programs,  that  we  conducted, 
where  the  challenge  was  always  on  assuring  that  the  sampling  frequency,  and  sampling 
locations,  selected,  provided  a  strong  statistical  basis  for  conclusions.  And  also  making  sure 
that  those  conclusions  were  based  on  facts  and  data.  (0008-1-1  [Pantazes,  Jeff]) 

Comment:  Another  example  of  that  is  the  site  selection  process  for  the  various  restoration 
projects  that  we  undertook.  Again,  looking  to  find  the  best  restoration  sites,  regardless  of  which 
state  they  were  in,  as  opposed  to  the  easiest  or  least  cost  sites.  (0008-1-2  [Pantazes,  Jeff]) 

Comment:  Similarly,  working  directly  with  the  Delaware  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and 
Environmental  Control's  marsh  and  aquatic  professionals,  including  Bill  Meredith  from  mosquito 
section,  Roy  Miller,  Bill  Jones,  Bob  Meadows,  and  others,  PSEG  assisted  with,  and  funded  the 
restoration  of  well  over  5,000  acres  of  degraded  marsh  in  Delaware.  That  totals  to  about  eight 
square  miles  of  improved  aquatic  habitat  that  is  in  existence,  and  functioning  very  well,  today. 
(0008-1-4  [Pantazes,  Jeff]) 

Comment:  PSEG  funded  the  land  that  Delaware  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and 
Environmental  Control  (DNREC)  bought  for  the  Mispillion  Harbor  Nature  Center,  that  DNREC 
now  operates.  It  is  one  of  the  best  crab  viewing  areas  in  the  region,  and  something  to  be  very 
proud  of.  To  sum  all  this  up,  the  basis  for  PSEG's  environmental  decisionmaking  has  been,  for 
my  30-plus  year  tenure,  and  remains  to  this  day,  focused  on  sound  and  defensible  science.

Comment:  I  know  in  my  day  to  day  interactions  with  Delaware,  I  never  forgot  that  people 
mattered.  And  I  worked  to  make  sure  that  I  could  always  say  that  we  were  open,  honest,  and 
forthright,  about  our  environmental  actions.  (0008-1-8  [Pantazes,  Jeff]) 

Comment:  The  working  relationships  we  have  developed  with  the  local  residents,  scientists, 
and  regulators,  have  helped  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  achieve  its  success.  I 
appreciate  the  assistance  and  cooperation  from  the  Delaware  Department  of  Natural  Resources 
and  Environmental  Control's  (DNREC's)  Division  of  Fish  and  Wildlife,  while  performing 
regulatory  activities  at  the  Cedar  Swamp,  and  the  Rocks  Wetland  Restoration  sites,  which  are 
along  the  Delaware  Bay,  just  south  of  Odessa.  (0008-2-10  [Evans,  Brenda]) 

Comment:  Like  many  folks,  when  I  first  graduated  from  college,  I  had  very  little  knowledge  of 
the  nuclear  industry.  With  my  degree  in  environmental  science  my  main  objective  was  to  find  a 
job  with  a  company  that  really  had  a  commitment  to  the  environment.  And  I  found  that  in  PSEG 
Nuclear.  (0008-2-7  [Evans,  Brenda]) 

Comment:  While  working  with  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  we  have  remained 
committed  with  working  with  federal,  state,  and  local  agencies.  And  seeking  and  implementing 
input,  that  we  receive  from  those  agencies,  and  local  residents,  and  other  stakeholders.  I  have 
been  very  fortunate  to  work  with  residents,  local  officials.  We  have  community  involvement 
committees  in  three  counties  in  New  Jersey,  as  well  as  stakeholders  from  New  Castle  and  Kent 
counties,  in  Delaware.  (0008-2-9  [Evans,  Brenda]) 

Comment:  We  take  great  pride  in  being  a  good  neighbor.  We  are  proactive  and  engage  the 
community,  when  a  challenge  arises,  so  they  understand  the  challenge,  and  have  their 
questions  answered.  Again,  there  are  no  surprises,  including  our  plans  to  explore  building  a 
new  nuclear  plant.  (0008-5-3  [Eilola,  Ed]) 

Comment:  More  importantly,  as  a  veteran,  I  was  in  the  Navy  for  eight  years,  I  appreciate  the 
way  PSEG  treats  veteran  employees.  I  was  in  the  United  States  New  York  and  those 
employees  are  still  supporting  the  military  today,  work  at  PSEG.  When  duty  calls  I  know  every 
PSEG  employee  that  has  been  called  up  feels  that  when  they  return  they  are  going  to  have  an 
equal,  or  better,  job  when  they  return.  (0008-7-6  [Shaffer,  Mark]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  general  support  for  the  Applicant.  These  comments  do 
not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action. 
No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  I  am  absolutely  certain  that  a  satisfactory  effort  to  replace  these  lost  wetlands  will 
be  undertaken  by  the  Company  to  the  vast  satisfaction  of  the  majority  of  the  public,  resource 
and  regulatory  agencies,  both  Federal  and  State,  and  a  broad  array  of  decision  makers.  They 
have  done  this  admirably  before,  involving  a  multidisciplinary  group  of  the  nation's  best 
scientists,  and  quality  engineers  to  design  and  implement  their  marsh  restoration  plan.  I  see  no 
reason  that  they  will  not  do  the  same  again,  inviting  in  the  top  technical  talent  to  achieve  their 
mitigation  objectives.  (0002-9  [Weinstein,  Michael])

Comment:  I  just  want  to  thank  PSEG  for  their  consideration  to  locate  a  fourth  reactor  in  Salem 
County.  They  have  always  been  a  good  neighbor,  a  good  partner.  They  are  involved  in  the 
community.  They  are  always  open  and  transparent.  I  think  their  motto  is  safety,  safety,  safety, 
train,  train,  train,  and  educate,  educate,  educate.  Which,  in  essence,  helps  our  community  out 
better.  Because  it  educates  our  residents.  So  we  thank  them  for  that.  They  are  totally  involved 
in  our  community,  in  a  lot  of  different  aspects,  through  non-profits,  through  our  community 
college,  just  every  aspect  of  our  community.  So  we  thank  them  for  that,  too.  (0004-10-2  [Acton, 
Julie]) 

Comment:  In  all  of  my  time,  working  in  New  Jersey,  it  has  been  my  experience  that  PSEG,  the 
largest  state  utility,  with  its  commitment  to  the  environment,  has  set  a  very  high  bar  for  utilities, 
both  in  and  out  of  the  state,  on  how  to  reduce  and  prevent  environmental  impacts,  on  how  to 
responsibly  address  environmental  conservation  issues  that  arise  as  part  of  their  operations  and 
how  to  be  an  effective  environmental  steward.  (0004-15-1  [McHugh,  Martin]) 

Comment:  And  since  I  know,  first  hand,  the  dedication  and  commitment,  of  many  of  these 
folks,  that  PSEG  will  be  working  with,  I  bet  that  working  together,  they  will  find  ways  to  go 
beyond  just  mitigating  these  impacts.  And  they  will  look  to  achieve  a  net  benefit  for  our  natural 
resources  in  this  state.  There  are  many  new  and  exciting  cutting  edge  approaches,  and  best 
management  practices,  that  can  be  implemented  to  achieve  those  net  benefits.  And  I  know  I  do 
not  have  to  urge  PSEG,  or  our  state  and  federal  agency  professionals,  to  look  at  these  BMPs, 
as  they  already  are  doing  so,  elsewhere,  in  many  different  arenas.  Green  infrastructure,  and 
nature  based  approaches,  like  living  shorelines,  rain  gardens  for  storm  water  management,  thin 
layer  application  of  dredge  material  to  restore  wetlands,  while  keeping  precious  sediment 
resources  in  our  estuaries.  These  are  just  a  few  of  the  examples  that  can  be  implemented  at 
this  site,  to  address  the  water  quality  issues,  restoration,  and  the  loss  of  CDF  space.  (0004-15-4 
[McHugh,  Martin]) 

Comment:  While  this  may  be  a  particularly  challenging  time  for  considering  any  new  power 
generating  facilities,  because  of  sea  level  rise,  climate  change,  and  ongoing  loss  of  habitat, 
there  are  many  new  forward  looking  programs,  and  research  projects,  under  way  that  are 
piloting  new  approaches,  like  green  infrastructure.  And  that  these  will  inform  the  future  for 
PSEG  at  this  site.  I’m  sure,  based  on  PSEG's  stewardship  record,  that  they  will  work  together 
with  our  state  and  federal  agencies  to  be  on  that  cutting  edge,  as  they  go  down  this  road,  and  to 
continue  to  be  a  steward.  (0004-15-5  [McHugh,  Martin]) 

Comment:  It  is  also  noteworthy  that  PSEG’s  an  industry  leader  in  practicing  responsible 
environmental  stewardship.  That  same  commitment  will  extend  to  the  new  plant,  in  its  planning, 
construction,  and  ultimate  operation,  if  approved  by  the  NRC.  The  Salem  generation  station,  in 
response  to  the  New  Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System,  an  acronym  we  know  in 
Trenton  and  NJPDES  permit,  embarked  on  an  unprecedented  effort  to  help  restore  a  portion  of 
the  Delaware  Estuary,  by  establishing  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  in  1994.  Today  the 
EEP  is  recognized  as  the  largest  privately  funded  program,  of  its  kind,  in  the  country  and, 
perhaps,  the  world  with  more  than  20,000  acres  of  salt  marsh  and  adjacent  uplands  being 
restored,  enhanced,  or  preserved.  (0004-2-12  [Egenton,  Michael])

Comment:  I  can't  tell  you  how  happy  I  am  to  be  here  today,  to  be  supporting  PSEG,  whose 
operations  led  to  clean  air  in  its  operations.  One  of  the  things,  that  has  astounded  me  the  most, 
in  coming  to  Salem  City,  is  that  I,  and  it  was  said  earlier,  that  you  might  hear  NIMBY  comments. 
I  have  never  heard,  in  Salem  City,  in  interacting  with  many  community  people,  any  adverse 
comments  against  PSEG  from  its  residents.  I  have  seen  no  NIMBY  in  Salem  City.  And  that 
amazes  me.  (0004-21-1  [Pierson,  Helene]) 

Comment:  The  plans,  proposed  by  PSEG,  can  be  viewed  in  light  of  their  past  mitigation,  and 
restoration  activities.  They  have  one  of  the  largest  and  most  successful  mitigation  projects  in 
the  country,  where  they  control  phragmites  to  produce  high  quality  salt  marsh  with  its  attendant 
mud  flats  and  inter-tidal  habitat  that  is  used  extensively  by  thousands  of  shore  birds,  and  other 
species.  Thus  their  estuary  enhancement  program  is  one  of  the  most  successful  in  the  country, 
has  received  a  variety  of  state  and  national  awards.  And  unlike  many  such  programs,  it  is 
sustainable.  Thus  it  is  my  professional  opinion  that  they  are  capable  of  and  will  deliver  on  their 
environmental  mitigation  and  restoration  plans.  The  company's  integrity,  and  environmental 
vision,  to  ensure  that  there  is  little  environmental  impact,  and  that  the  restoration  and  mitigation 
plans  will  result  in  a  far  more  high  quality  habitat  than  is  presently  on  that  site.  (0004-5-7  [Burger, 
Joanna]) 

Comment:  We  take  great  pride  in  being  a  good  neighbor.  We  are  proactive,  and  engage  the 
community  when  there  are  issues  with  our  operations,  to  make  sure  that  they  have  an 
understanding  of  the  challenges  that  we  face,  and  how  we  are  answering,  or  how  we  are 
dealing  with  those  when  they  occur.  Again,  no  surprises.  And  that  means  no  surprises  in  our 
plans  to  explore  the  opportunity  to  build  another  nuclear  power  plant  down  here  at  Artificial 
Island.  And  when  I  stop  and  I  think  back  on  the  --  originally  this  site  was  licensed  for  four 
reactors.  And  I  think,  since  then,  the  world  of  science  has  even  progressed  from  there,  and  I 
feel  very  good  about  the  Environmental  Impact  Statement  that  has  been  generated  by  the  NRC 
with  help  from  the  Army  Corps.  I'm  not  going  to  go  into  the  impacts  of  what  would  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  do.  I  think  Mike  did  that  very  well  in  his  opening  remarks.  But  that  these 
impacts,  as  well  as  many  others,  will  affect  our  community.  And  we  have  met  with  the  County 
Freeholders,  in  all  of  the  local  municipalities,  and  we  intend  to  keep  up  that  relationship  as  we 
go  down  this  path.  (0004-8-4  [Joyce,  Tom]) 

Comment:  I'm  absolutely  certain  that  a  satisfactory  effort  to  replace  these  lost  wetlands,  will  be 
undertaken,  by  the  company,  to  the  vast  satisfaction  of  the  majority  of  public  resource,  and 
regulatory  agency  personnel,  both  federal  and  state,  and  a  broad  array  of  decisionmakers. 

They  have  done  this  admirably  before,  involving  a  multi-disciplinary  group  of  the  nation's  best 
scientists,  and  quality  engineers  to  design  and  implement  their  marsh  restoration  program.  I 
see  absolutely  no  reason  why  they  will  not  do  the  same  again,  inviting  in  the  top  technical  talent 
to  achieve  their  mitigation  objectives.  (0004-9-10  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Comment:  And,  in  fact,  as  a  member  of  a  scientific  organization  I,  typically,  don't  come  out  to 
public  hearings  and  speak  on  behalf  of  a  permit,  or  a  permit  applicant.  I  have  only  done  it  three 
times.  This  is  the  third  time.  And  each  one  of  those  times  it  has  been  on  behalf  of  PSEG.  And 
that  is  why  I  drove  several  hours  to  be  here  tonight  to,  again,  speak  on  behalf  of  their  track 
record  with  respect  to  the  environment.  (0006-6-2  [DeLuca,  Mike])

Comment:  And,  finally,  I  will  just  close  with  a  statement  about  PSEG  in  terms  of  their  value  as 
a  community  asset.  I  believe  President  Baillie  mentioned  this  in  her  remarks.  I  really  think  that 
they  are  an  asset  to  the  environment.  They  really  contribute  a  great  deal  to  our  state.  They 
continue  to  do  that.  They  have  done  things  that  they  haven't  had  to  do,  they've  gone  above  and 
beyond.  And  I  just  feel,  very  strongly,  that  they  are  capable  and  have  the  expertise,  and  can 
bring  the  expertise  to  bear,  on  mitigating  the  impacts  of  this  proposed  project.  (0006-6-6 
[DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Comment:  So  in  summary  I  just  want  to  say  that  I'm  very  comfortable  and  confident  that  PSEG 
has  the  capacity  and  expertise  to  address  the  environmental  impacts  that  are  being  considered, 
and  will  happen,  as  a  result  of  the  proposed  project.  (0007-17-5  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Comment:  We  take  great  pride  in  being  a  good  neighbor.  We  are  proactive  and  engage  the 
community  when  a  challenge  arises,  so  that  they  understand  the  challenge,  and  have  their 
questions  answered.  Again,  there  are  no  surprises,  including  our  plans  to  explore  building  a 
new  nuclear  plant.  (0007-7-3  [Eilola,  Ed]) 

Comment:  I  was  glad  when  I  heard  that  we  had  applied  for  an  Early  Site  Permit.  Salem  Hope 
Creek  nuclear  plants  have  been  an  important  source  of  electrical  power  here,  in  the  Delaware 
valley.  And,  more  importantly,  they  are  an  employer  who  provides  numerous,  stable,  good 
paying  jobs  for  people  in  both  sides  of  the  river.  During  the  recent  financial  crisis,  that  we  have 
been  through  for  the  last  couple  of  years,  PSEG  looked  for  ways  to  save  money  so  that  they 
could  save  employee  jobs.  They  didn't  do  it  the  other  way,  they  didn't  look  for  ways  to  cut  jobs, 
so  that  they  could  save  money  for  the  company.  (0008-7-4  [Shaffer,  Mark]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  general  support  for  the  applicant,  as  well  as  general 
support  for  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  These  comments  do  not  provide  any  specific 
information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action.  No  changes  were 
made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  I  represent  nearly  800  members  who  work  at  PSEG's  existing  nuclear  generating 
stations,  Salem  One,  Salem  Two,  and  Hope  Creek.  Those  three  plants  have  provided  safe, 
clean,  and  reliable  electric  power  to  the  people  of  New  Jersey  for  38  years.  (0004-18-1  [Hufsey, 
Moe]) 

Comment:  I  worked  in  the  environmental  field  for  15  years  now,  and  I'm  very  familiar  with  the 
tough  environmental  rules  and  regulations  in  the  state  of  New  Jersey.  The  state  is  one  of  the 
few  that  has  such  strict  regulations.  And  having  worked  in  the  environmental  department  at  the 
stations,  I  can  assure  you  that  the  plants  at  PSEG  perform  very  well  in  meeting  our  state's 
regulations.  (0004-20-2  [Timberman,  Tanya]) 

Comment:  It  is  very  clean,  and  green  energy.  And  being  a  local,  this  is  very  important  to  me, 
and  my  family.  So,  no,  I'm  not  afraid  to  work  there.  (0004-20-3  [Timberman,  Tanya]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  general  support  for  the  existing  nuclear  units  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  These  comments  do  not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the

environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of 
these  comments. 

Comment:  What  I  found  is  a  commitment  to  safety,  quality,  and  environmental  stewardship. 
Unlike  the  coal  and  gas  industries,  these  companies  are  transparent  in  their  practices.  And 
while  they  still  ultimately  are  accountable  to  their  shareholders,  the  scrutiny  that  comes  with 
nuclear  has  created  educational  partnerships,  in  local  communities,  environmental  stewardship 
like  PSEG's  Estuary  Enhancement  Program,  that  you  have  heard  mentioned  numerous  times 
today.  Openness  with  regard  to  public  relation,  and  lots  of  baseload  energy  we  can  count  on  for 
decades.  (0004-14-2  [Moscovici,  Dan]) 

Comment:  PSEG's  commitment  to  conservation  programs  has  made  it  an  industry  leader  for 
our  environment,  in  our  state.  And  I  can  list  a  number  of  projects  that  illustrate  PSEG's 
commitment.  Of  course  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  which  is  restoring  upwards  of 
20,000  acres  of  coastal  marsh,  is  the  largest.  But,  in  my  own  direct  experience,  I  saw  the 
utilities,  and  PSEG's  staff  commitment  to  environment  on  many  occasions,  in  much  smaller 
projects.  Like  the  cleanup  of  historic  operations,  the  protection  of  osprey  nests  on  PSEG 
facilities,  the  restoration  of  important  habitat  on  its  power  line  right  of  ways.  In  many  of  these 
matters  I  saw  the  staffs  commitment  to  not  only  doing  the  right  thing,  but  to  go  above  and 
beyond  what  was  required.  And  New  Jersey's  environment  has  benefitted,  and  will  continue  to 
benefit  from  that  kind  of  stewardship  commitment.  (0004-15-2  [McHugh,  Martin]) 

Comment:  My  husband  was  born  and  raised  there,  so  he  has  lived  there  60  years.  We  live  ten 
miles,  within  10  miles  of  the  plant,  and  we  have  never  had  a  concern  about  safety.  Probably 
that  is  because,  like  the  person  who  spoke  before  me,  we  know  many  people.  Many  of  them 
are  my  neighbors,  that  work,  continue  to  work  at  PSEG.  These  people  are  involved  in  our 
community.  I  serve  on  many  communities  with  representatives  of  this  company,  as  well  as 
some  of  their  high  level  executives.  (0006-3-1  [Baillie,  Joan]) 

Comment:  I  do  know  that  PSEG  takes  seriously  their  corporate  responsibilities  to  protect  the 
health  and  safety  of  all  residents,  both  in  New  Jersey,  and  Delaware.  They  are  dedicated  to 
reduce  the  environmental  impact  of  our  environment,  as  a  result  of  their  operations.  (0007-1-3 
[Cathcart,  Richard]) 

Comment:  I  support  the  Draft  Environmental  Impact  Statement  that  the  NRC  is  presenting 
here  today.  And  I'm  a  --  I'm  actually  very  glad  for  the  choice  that  PSEG  made  for  the  location. 
And  I  live  closer  because  I'm  confident  in  the  technology,  and  I'm  confident  in  the  people  that 
are  in  the  plants.  (0007-10-3  [Clancy,  James]) 

Comment:  In  my  current  job  it  is  my  responsibility  that  my  engineers  follow  and  apply  all  the 
processes  and  procedures,  that  are  in  place,  to  ensure  an  event  free  operation.  I  can  guarantee 
you  that  the  workforce,  at  PSEG  Nuclear,  is  one  that  is  qualified  and  fully  engaged  with  the 
safety  of  themselves,  and  the  public,  and  the  neighbors  of  PSEG  Nuclear.  Every  process  that 
PSEG  Nuclear  has  is  built  with  several  defenses  in  their  players,  from  the  qualification  to  the 
training,  and  executions,  and  housekeeping  on  each  one  of  the  jobs  that  we  do.  We  ensure 
quality,  and  safe  work  is  performed  across  the  whole  organization.  As  a  matter  of  fact  I'm  part 
of  the  team  that  reviews  and  investigates  events  that  challenge  the  operation  of  the  plant.

There  are  scrutinies  and  reviews  on  those  products,  and  I  take  a  lot  of  pride  on  the  products  and 
investigations  that  we  create.  (0007-15-1  [Torres,  Katherine]) 

Comment:  PSEG,  itself,  is  an  active  community  member.  And  when  I  say  community  I  mean 
that  in  three  areas,  business,  education,  civic,  and  also  in  the  environmental  community.  I  think 
the  last  speaker  talked  a  little  bit  about  their  involvement  in  the  environment.  And  the 
gentleman  who  was  in  the  regulatory  area,  that  PSEG,  they  get  it.  They  are  involved  with  the 
community,  all  four  of  those  communities.  In  terms  of  them  working  with  the  business 
community,  here  in  New  Castle  County,  they  understand  their  impact,  and  they  have  reached 
out  and  worked  directly  with  the  Chamber  to  help  small  business  programs,  and  help  them  grow 
and  thrive.  (0007-18-5  [Kleinschmidt,  Mark]) 

Comment:  PSEG  has  worked  very  closely  with  the  State  of  Delaware  since  1977,  including 
economic  support,  environmental  protection,  and  emergency  planning.  PSEG  takes  its 
responsibility  to  protect  the  health  and  safety  of  the  public,  and  the  environment,  seriously.  And 
works,  every  day,  to  ensure  that  our  operations  do  not  adversely  impact  people  with  the  land, 
waters,  and  air,  that  are  near  our  facilities,  regardless  of  which  state  they  are  in.  (0007-8-2 
[Spiese,  Steve]) 

Comment:  Let  me  conclude  by  saying  I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  PSEG's 
operations,  for  a  number  of  years.  I'm  impressed  by  their  willingness  to  respond  to 
environmental  constraints  in  their  planning.  They  have  embraced  ecological  sciences  as  a 
planning  tool  for  engineering,  and  have  been  proactive  in  seeking  the  guidance  of  experts  to 
reduce  their  environmental  impacts.  The  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  represents  a  long¬ 
term  commitment  to  the  region,  and  its  natural  resources.  I  would  expect  that  commitment  to 
continue  with  the  proposed  new  construction.  (0007-9-11  [Wall,  Roland]) 

Comment:  Public  Service  puts  a  strong  emphasis  on  safety.  And  it  is  not  only  personal  safety, 
but  nuclear  safety  as  well.  (0008-2-2  [Evans,  Brenda]) 

Comment:  Environmental  compliance,  another  big  emphasis  with  PSEG.  PSEG  holds  its 
employees  to  very  high  standards,  and  integrity,  and  expects  all  employees  to  continue  to  strive 
for  personal,  as  well  as  operational  improvements  and  excellence,  and  to  be  accountable  for  all 
their  actions.  (0008-2-3  [Evans,  Brenda]) 

Comment:  I  was  also  cautious  of,  and  curious,  of  how  safe  working  in  a  nuclear  plant  would 
be.  Through  my  training  and  work  experience,  I  quickly  learned  that  nuclear  facility  was  a  clean 
and  a  safe  place  to  work.  I  also  learned  just  how  strongly  PSEG  was  committed  to  maintaining 
that  safe  work  environment  through  continued  training,  procedures,  and  programs.  While 
working  at  Hope  Creek,  and  the  Estuary  Enhancement  Program,  strict  adherence  to  regulatory 
policies,  be  they  environmental  or  nuclear,  it  is  not  an  option,  it  is  an  expectation.  (0008-2-8 
[Evans,  Brenda]) 

Comment:  At  PSEG  we  understand  our  obligation  to  the  local  community,  the  environment, 
our  friends,  families  and  coworkers,  to  provide  safe,  reliable,  economic  and  green  energy.  We 
operate  our  plants  within  a  culture  of  safety  and  transparency.  We  encourage  our  employees  to 
raise  issues,  and  to  be  open  on  how  to  do  things  better.  There  are  always  lessons  to  be

learned.  Our  success  is  made  possible  by  employees.  There  are  no  surprises,  not  in  our 
operations  and,  certainly,  not  with  our  stakeholders.  There  is  no  new  nuclear  without  good  old 
nuclear.  (0008-5-2  [Eilola,  Ed]) 

Comment:  I  believe  that  living  inside  the  ten  mile  emergency  planning  zone  is  safe.  I  believe 
the  training,  I'm  an  instructor  at  PSEG  Nuclear.  I  teach  the  operators  how  to  operate  the 
nuclear  power  plant,  and  what  to  do  in  an  emergency.  I  believe  the  training  they  receive,  the 
operators  at  a  nuclear  plant  are  trained  more  than,  perhaps,  any  other  worker  in  the  entire 
world.  They  get  seven  weeks  of  training  every  year,  a  week  of  training  every  seven  weeks, 
essentially.  So  they  are  one  of  the  highest  trained,  most  proficient,  most  drilled  employees  in 
the  world,  operating  nuclear  plants  in  the  United  States.  (0008-7-3  [Shaffer,  Mark]) 

Comment:  We  believe  in  operating  the  reactor  safely,  and  protecting  the  environment,  and 
protecting  the  health  and  safety  of  the  public  are  guiding  principles  for  how  we  work.  And  we 
incorporate  that  in  everything  we  do,  in  the  upgrades  that  we  made  to  the  plant,  in  the  way  that 
we  train  our  operators,  and  the  way  we  train  our  chemistry  technicians,  and  in  the  way  we 
operate  our  cooling  tower  systems.  The  way  we  treat  that  water  so  that  when  we  return  it  to  the 
environment,  it  is  clean,  it  is  safe,  and  it  doesn't  have  an  environmental  impact  that  would 
adversely  affect  conditions  in  the  area.  (0008-7-5  [Shaffer,  Mark]) 

Comment:  In  closing  I  would  like  to  say  that  I  support  the  building  of  an  additional  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  site  New  Jersey.  I  believe  it  makes  good  environmental  sense  to  build 
this  kind  of  clean  electrical  generating  capacity.  I  believe  it  makes  sense  to  have  a  company 
like  PSEG  that  promotes  diversity,  supports  veterans,  supports  the  community,  and  a  company 
that  has  good  financial  history,  and  a  safe  operating  history,  build  that  plant.  And  I  hope  they 
move  forward  and  actually  eventually  build  it.  (0008-7-7  [Shaffer,  Mark]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  general  support  for  the  applicant,  as  well  as  general 
support  for  the  existing  nuclear  units  at  the  PSEG  Site.  These  comments  do  not  provide  any 
specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action.  No  changes 
were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  This  power  plant  must  be  expanded,  it  must  move  forward.  There  are  risks,  of 
course  there  are  risks.  If  they  had  told  me  what  the  risks  were,  before  my  children  were  born,  I 
probably  would  have  made  a  whole  other  set  of  decisions  regarding  raising  children.  But  we 
must  move  forward,  or  we  must  resign  ourselves  to  going  home  and  cooking  our  dinner  on 
campfires.  (0004-19-2  [Bobbit,  John]) 

Comment:  So,  you  know,  for  all  those  reasons,  the  vocational  school  is  happy  to  see  a  project 
like  this  on  the  horizon,  with  the  opportunity  for  creation  of  jobs,  and  for  our  students  who  are 
learning  about  these  many  areas,  to  put  those  learning  experiences  into  action.  (0004-23-6 
[Helder,  Jason]) 

Comment:  Overall  what  PSEG  is  planning  to  do  is  going  to  be  beneficial  to  the  environment, 
given  the  constraints  that  you  have,  if  you  are  going  to  put  in  a  roadway.  (0006-7-9  [Widjeskog,

Comment:  In  comparison,  the  proposed  nuclear  plant,  at  the  PSEG  site,  would  generate  large 
amounts  of  carbon  free  power,  much  more  reliably  than  any  renewable  power  facility.  This 
power  generation  can  take  place  at  a  plant  occupying  a  substantially  smaller  footprint,  thus 
minimizing  any  adverse  impact  to  avian  and  bat  habitat.  (0006-9-4  [Wiwel,  Kathy]) 

Comment:  What  a  new  power  plant  means  for  me,  for  Women  in  Nuclear  (WIN),  it  means  that 
I  can  complete  my  career  here.  I  can  stay  living  in  Delaware,  which  I  like.  It  is  also  beneficial  to 
our  WIN  members  who  want  to  continue  and  retire,  working  in  this  area,  working  for  this  great 
company,  which  has  been  my  experience.  (0007-15-2  [Torres,  Katherine]) 

Comment:  As  a  regional  player  PSEG  employs  a  lot  of  people.  You  have  heard  the 
employment  stats  here  in  Delaware.  And  that  will  only  grow  if  and  when  the  plant  does  get  to 
be  expanded.  (0007-18-6  [Kleinschmidt,  Mark]) 

Comment:  A  potential  new  plant  would  have  a  very  positive  impact  on  our  community.  We 
have  met  with  elected  officials,  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware,  and  will  continue  to  work  with  the 
community  throughout  this  entire  process.  We  recognize  that  this  Early  Site  Permit,  and 
possible  new  plant,  will  not  be  possible  without  the  community  support.  (0007-7-4  [Eilola,  Ed]) 

Comment:  For  all  those  reasons,  to  meet  the  growing  electric  demand,  to  help  clean  the  air, 
and  to  provide  good,  high  quality  jobs,  I  support  PSEG's  new  safe,  clean,  and  reliable  nuclear 
power  plant.  (0007-8-8  [Spiese,  Steve]) 

Comment:  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  come  here,  tonight,  to  express  my  support  for  the 
potential  new  power  plant  in  Hancock's  Bridge,  New  Jersey.  (0008-2-1  [Evans,  Brenda]) 

Comment:  Should  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  be  constructed  I  believe  it  would  be  a  big  asset 
to  the  local  communities,  and  provide  clean  energy  to  meet  the  future's  needs.  (0008-2-13 
[Evans,  Brenda]) 

Comment:  A  new  nuclear  facility  would  not  only  provide  this  reliable  energy  for  the  region,  but 
high  paying  jobs,  and  fulfilling  careers.  (0008-2-5  [Evans,  Brenda]) 

Comment:  Potential  new  plant  would  have  a  very  positive  impact  on  our  community.  We  have 
met  with  elected  officials  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware,  and  will  continue  to  work  with  the 
community  throughout  the  process.  We  recognize  this  Early  Site  Permit,  and  possible  new 
plant,  will  not  be  possible  without  the  community's  support.  (0008-5-4  [Eilola,  Ed]) 

Comment:  In  light  of  the  ability  for  this  project  to  replace  a  significant  percentage  of  polluting 
fossil  energy  sources  in  our  region,  with  reliable  carbon-free  generation,  and  minimal  impact  on 
the  environment,  I  support  the  efforts  of  PSEG  to  expand  nuclear  generation  in  southern  New 
Jersey.  (0008-6-6  [Wiwel,  Kathy]) 

Comment:  I  support  more  Nuclear  Reactors  here  in  Salem  County,  N.J.  I  believe  it  is  a  safe 
method  of  electric  generation  as  proved  by  the  many  safe  years  of  PSEG  operations  here  in 
Salem  County.  The  economy  here  needs  a  boost  badly.  Jobs  are  hard  to  find.  Real  estate  is 
at  a  standstill,  and  construction  of  a  new  Nuclear  Reactor  would  give  our  economy  a  much

needed  boost.  Also,  the  added  generation  would  be  a  boost  to  the  whole  east  coast.  (0048-1 
[Johnston,  Clarence]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  general  support  for  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site.  These  comments  do  not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental 
effects  of  the  proposed  action.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these 
comments. 

E.2.36  General  Comments  in  Opposition  to  the  Licensing  Action 

Comment:  The  Delaware  Riverkeeper  Network  is  opposed  to  proposed  Salem  4.  (0004-3-1 
[van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  This  proposal,  to  build  another  nuclear  plant,  and  the  EIS,  the  Draft  EIS,  are  both, 
in  our  opinion,  failures.  (0006-4-16  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  So  I  would  appreciate  that,  A,  you  back  off  this.  B,  save  our  wetlands  and  not 
pollute  them  any  more  with  the  river  dredgings,  so  we  can  get  our  bay  back.  Because  the 
Delaware  Bay,  and  I'm  a  fisherman,  and  an  outdoorsman,  is  a  liquid  desert.  (0007-3-16  [August, 
Bernard]) 

Comment:  So  we  are  in  a  crisis  here.  And  they  keep  building  these  plants  without  proper 
safety  and  it  is  proven  that  you  can't  do  it,  is  absurd.  So  that  is  all  I'm  saying  about  this.  And  I 
am  going  to  fight  this  tooth  and  nail.  (0007-3-20  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  But  if  a  facility  is  seemingly  not  competent  to  run  the  three  reactors  they  already 
have,  I  don’t  understand  why  we  are  even  considering  allowing  them  to  build  a  fourth  one,  or 
potentially  more.  (0007-5-11  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  And  in  the  long  run  I  think  that  [renewable  energy]  is  a  much  more  viable  solution. 
Those  things  are  being  addressed  very  well.  I  think  sometimes  we  jump  too  quickly,  for  our 
energy  needs,  to  move  with  things  without  really  thinking  them  through.  I  know  it  has  been 
done  in  the  past  in  some  of  the  areas  for  wind  energy.  I  fear  we  may  be  doing  it  here.  (0008-8-5 
[Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  And  to  continue  on  to  building  this  site,  for  another  nuclear  plant  is  a  waste  of  your 
money,  and  a  stakeholdership.  Fifteen  years  from  now  that  plant  will  be  overrun,  like  the  plants 
they  are  building  now.  And  the  technology  they  are  using  is  unproven,  it  is  hypothetical, 
especially  when  it  comes  to  the  small  modular  reactors.  It  is  vapor  ware.  It  is  done  on 
computer  models,  it  is  unproven  science.  (0008-9-10  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  I  strongly  oppose  the  building  of  an  additional  nuclear  reactor  at  Salem  as 
proposed.  (0010-1  [Cannon,  John]) 

Comment:  I  am  against  the  construction  of  another  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  site  in  Salem, 
New  Jersey.  (0011-1  [Keating,  Thomas])

Appendix  E 


Comment:  I  am  against  the  construction  of  another  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  site  in  Salem, 
New  Jersey  ,  for  the  following  reasons:  1 .  When  this  plant  was  first  built  it  was  placed  there 
because  it  was  one  of  the  least  populated  areas  in  NJ.  Today  it  is  heavily  populated  on  both 
sides  of  the  river,  with  dozens  of  new  suburban  areas.  (0011-2  [Keating,  Thomas]) 

Comment:  We  request  that  the  Atomic  Safety  and  Licensing  Board  (ASLB)  conduct  a 
contested  hearing  due  to  the  environmental  concerns  about  the  ESP  and  that  NRC  not  grant 
this  ESP  due  to  the  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  possible 
future  use  of  the  PSEG  site  to  construct  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  (0020-1-2  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  Since  the  DEIS  concludes  that  there  is  no  actual  demonstrated  need  for  this  power 
plant,  the  NRC  should  now  conclude  that  the  granting  of  an  ESP  is  not  appropriate  at  this  time. 
The  NRC  should  also  conclude  that  the  "no  action"  alternative  should  be  selected  as  the  best 
choice  for  the  environment  and  the  people  of  New  Jersey.  (0020-5-4  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  [NJDEP  Bureau  of  Marine  Fisheries]  would  recommend  "NO  ACTION"  on  this 
Early  Site  Permit.  (0021-2-14  [Foster,  Ruth]) 

Comment:  Building  any  more  nuclear  reactors  is  unconscionable.  (0024-6  [Doyle,  Kathy]) 
Comment:  DON'T  DO  IT!!!  (0025-1  [Killian,  Lynn]) 

Comment:  It  is  transparent  that  the  nuclear  reactor  proposal  is  a  threat  to  ecology  of  public 
health  and  safety  and  that  the  PSEG  also  is  working  with  a  company  on  designs  for  a  new  type 
of  "small,  modular  reactor"  with  fewer  parts,  a  simpler  design,  deep  underground  containment 
and  waterless  cooling  features;  and  that  this  effort  be  accelerated  with  a  postponement  of  the 
proposed  nuclear  reactor  construction.  (0028-2  [Prescott,  James]) 

Comment:  As  a  resident  of  Delaware,  a  neighbor  of  New  Jersey,  and  a  concerned  citizen,  I 
strongly  oppose  PSE  &  G's  proposed  new  nuclear  site.  (0030-1  [Riddle,  Frances]) 

Comment:  We  are  concerned  about  the  hazards  of  nuclear  power  on  the  Delaware  River,  and 
oppose  any  expansion  at  the  Salem/Hope  complex.  We  live  close  to  the  river 
(Edgemoor/Bellefonte  area)  just  north  of  the  evacuation  zone.  Our  concerns  include  increased 
deleterious  impact  on  the  environment  and  marine  life,  and  on  the  health  of  people  from  routine 
operations  or  catastrophic  failure,  as  well  as  the  massive  impact  and  costs  of  hazardous  nuclear 
waste  and  its  management  into  the  infinite  future  of  earth.  (0031-1  [Windle,  Judy  and  Randy]) 

Comment:  We  disagree  with  the  expansion  of  nuclear  power  and  believe  that  energy 
conservation  and  low  impact  renewable  energy  should  be  developed  to  provide  the  best  benefit 
with  least  harm  to  ecosystems,  resources  and  all  life  on  earth.  (0031-2  [Windle,  Judy  and  Randy]) 

Comment:  For  the  above  reasons  and  concerns,  I  find  that  it  is  not  in  the  public's  best  interest 
to  grant  the  proposed  early  site  permit,  nor  to  construct  future  nuclear  reactors  in  this  area.

Comment:  Once  the  missing  information  is  evaluated,  it  should  be  apparent  that  NRC  should 
not  grant  this  ESP  due  to  the  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the 
possible  future  use  of  the  PSEG  Site  to  construct  and  operate  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.

Comment:  NO  MORE  REACTORS  ON  MY  DELAWARE  RIVER.  I  AM  A  DELAWARE 
RESIDENT  AND  I  DON’T  WANT  ANYMORE  REACTORS.  (0035-1  [O,  Nancy]) 

Comment:  I  urge  you  to  REFRAIN  from  providing  an  early  site  permit  to  PSEG  Nuclear  for 
adding  on  to  what  is  already  the  second  largest  nuclear  complex  in  the  United  States.  (0036-1 
[Cornelia,  Jared]) 

Comment:  I  strongly  oppose  the  PSEG  plan  to  add  new  nuclear  reactors  to  a  man-made  island 
in  the  Delaware  River.  (0037-1  [Wasfi,  Ellen]) 

Comment:  I  am  saying  NO  to  adding  more  nuclear  reactors  to  the  Delaware  River!!  (0038-1 
[Slijepeevic,  Aleksandra]) 

Comment:  OPPOSE  REACTOR.  (0039-1  [Collins,  Carol]) 

Comment:  Please  do  not  begin  this  endeavor.  It  is  soooooo  old  school,  inefficient  and 
unnecessary.  Wake  up  to  the  new  world!!!  (0042-1  [Haggerty,  Diane]) 

Comment:  I  strongly  oppose  providing  an  early  site  permit  for  PSEG  at  the  Salem  location.  I 
also  strongly  oppose  additional  nuclear  reactors  at  the  Salem  location.  (0044-1  [Slack,  Gary]) 

Comment:  There  are  many  reasons  why  Salem  should  not  get  this  permit  and  should  not  open 
additional  nuclear  reactors.  I  hope  that  you  will  consider  these  and  decide  not  to  issue  this 
permit.  (0044-5  [Slack,  Gary]) 

Comment:  No  new  reactors  at  Salem!  (0045-1  [Durnan,  Alexander]) 

Comment:  It  is  important  to  me  that  human  beings  in  the  future  know  that  some  spoke  out 
against  expanding  nuclear  power  facilities  at  Hope  Creek/Salem.  (0047-1  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  general  opposition  to  the  PSEG  ESP  application  and/or 
a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  These  comments  do  not  provide  specific  information 
related  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS 
as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

E.2.37  General  Comments  in  Opposition  to  the  Licensing  Process 

Comment:  The  proposal,  this  proposal  is  complex.  And,  unfortunately,  so  complex  that  it  is 
often  left  to  the  experts,  like  yourselves,  and  consultants,  to  tell  us  what  we  should  do.  To  build, 
or  not  to  build?  That  is  the  question.  We  suggest  that  leaving  this  question  to  the  experts,  and 
their  high-priced  paid  consultants,  is  the  biggest  mistake  we  could  all  make.  (0006-4-1  [Brook,

Comment:  This  proposal,  to  build  another  nuclear  plant,  and  the  EIS,  the  Draft  EIS,  are  both, 
in  our  opinion,  failures.  (0006-4-15  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  After  attending  the  public  meeting  on  the  evening  of  October  23,  2014,  in 
Middletown,  DE  and  having  the  opportunity  to  ask  a  question  and  after  reviewing  the  information 
provided  in  the  U.S.  NRC's  DEIS  for  an  ESP  at  the  PSEG  site  Readers  Guide,  I  have  come 
away  with  the  following  concerns:  .  .  .  that  the  information  presented  to  the  "public"  was  too 
technical  for  the  average  person  to  comprehend  thus  minimizing  the  public's  ability  to  make 
informed  commentary.  (0012-2  [Magyar,  David]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  general  opposition  to  the  NRC's  ESP  application  review 
process.  These  comments  do  not  provide  specific  information  related  to  the  ESP  process  or  the 
environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of 
these  comments. 

Comment:  The  average  nuclear  power  plant  in  this  country  has  been  given  a  license  way  past 
their  day  of  shutting  down,  like  a  normal  chemical  process.  Some  of  these  plants  are  able  to 
license  now  for  120  years,  which  is  practically  impossible.  It  is  like  what  they  used  to  do  during 
the  elections,  say  putting  lipstick  on  the  pig.  It  is  a  money  sucker,  it  is  going  to  get  us  nowhere. 
We  are  going  to  be  behind.  It  is  depriving  us  of  a  decent  quality  of  life.  (0008-9-4  [August, 
Bernard]) 

Comment:  The  DEIS  works  backwards  from  a  predetermined  outcome.  .  .  .  This  review,  as 
detailed  below,  can  generally  be  summarized  by  the  belief  that  the  NRC  has  worked  backwards 
on  the  DEIS  by  starting  with  a  conclusion  that  a  nuclear  power  plant  should  be  built  and  then 
justifying  it  through  the  use  and  analysis  of  the  information  presented  in  the  DEIS.  This 
justification  DEIS,  i.e.  the  proposed  construction  of  Salem  4,  is  the  opposite  of  what  the  NRC 
should  have  conducted,  and  virtually  guarantees  the  outcome  in  a  way  that  violates  the  intent 
and  purpose  of  NEPA.  If  the  NRC  conducted  an  objective  analysis,  including  consideration  of 
the  information  in  this  comment  regarding  the  project's  significant  and  irreversible  environmental 
impacts,  it  would  be  clear  that  the  "no  build"  alternative  should  be  selected.  (0020-1-5  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  general  opposition  to  the  NRC's  licensing  process  for 
nuclear  power  plants,  but  do  not  provide  specific  information  related  to  the  ESP  process  or  the 
environmental  effects  of  the  proposed  action.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of 
these  comments. 

Comment:  We  believe  that  this  DEIS  needs  to  be  redone.  (0016-8  [Tittel,  Jeff]) 

Comment:  DRN  believes  that  the  DEIS  is  inadequate  in  assessing  the  potential  environmental 
impacts  and  additional  information,  data,  and  analyses  should  be  evaluated.  Furthermore,  DRN 
believes  that  a  substantially  different  alternative  meets  the  purpose  and  need  statement  rather 
than  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  this  site  especially  since  there  is 
potential  for  significant  environmental  degradation.  (0020-1-3  [van  Rossum,  Maya])

Comment:  We  believe  that  this  DEIS  is  inadequate  to  properly  assess  the  potential 
environmental  impacts  of  constructing  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  this  site  and 
that  additional  information,  potentially  involving  new  research,  needs  to  be  provided  and 
evaluated.  (0022-1  [Butch,  Kerry  Margaret]  [King,  Charlotte]  [Pryde,  Coralie]) 

Comment:  We  believe  that  the  draft  EIS  is  inadequate  in  assessing  the  potential  environmental

David]  [DePaul,  Shelly]  [Furst,  Charles]  [Hvozdovich,  Steve]  [McNutt,  Richard]  [Nolan,  Christine]  [Owens, 
Caroline]  [Pringle,  David]  [Roe,  Amy]  [Tittel,  Jeff]  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  general  dissatisfaction  with  the  NRC's  EIS  but  do  not 
provide  specific  information  related  to  revising  the  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a 
result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  After  attending  the  public  meeting  on  the  evening  of  October  23,  2014,  in 
Middletown,  DE  and  having  the  opportunity  to  ask  a  question  and  after  reviewing  the  information 
provided  in  the  U.S.  NRC's  DEIS  for  an  ESP  at  the  PSEG  site  Readers  Guide,  I  have  come 
away  with  the  following  concerns:  .  .  .  there  was  no  effort  to  explain  the  significance  of  the  50 
mi.  impact  area  designated  on  several  maps.  (0012-3  [Magyar,  David]) 

Response:  The  "region"  of  impact  is  assumed  to  be  a  50-mi  radius  around  the  PSEG  Site 
because  almost  all  of  the  impacts  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be 
confined  to  that  area.  The  text  in  Section  2.2.3  of  the  EIS  has  been  revised  to  clarify  this  point. 

Comment:  A  change  was  made  to  the  original  ESP  regulations  in  2006  so  that  now  they  are 
promoting  "segmentation"  of  the  environmental  review,  by  only  looking  at  the  site  for  the 
issuance  of  a  permit  and  then  looking  at  the  reactor  design  later.  This  approach  of 
segmentation  of  the  overall  project  violates  NEPA.  (0020-1-10  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  Since  the  ultimate  use  of  this  property  will  be  for  a  nuclear  reactor,  the  current 
process  segments  out  this  review  and  allows  for  investments,  time  and  resources  to  be 
committed  to  this  location  by  the  federal  government  and  the  applicant.  ESP  not  only  allows  for 
preconstruction  investments  but  also  preconstruction  work  on  the  site.  All  of  these  investments 
of  time  and  money  will  likely  later  be  used  as  an  attempt  to  justify  the  ultimate  approval  of  the 
nuclear  reactor  when  an  application  is  made,  and  this  approach  violates  the  spirit  and  the 
requirements  of  NEPA.  (0020-1-11  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  Since  the  DEIS  uses  segmentation  as  its  underlying  approach,  DRN  requests  the 
NRC  to  withdraw  the  DEIS,  as  it  promotes  arbitrary  and  capricious  agency  actions  in  violation  of 
NEPA.  (0020-1-12  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  Early  Site  Permit  process  violates  NEPA  through  the  improper  establishment  of 
a  NRC  sponsored  segmentation  process.  The  DEIS  makes  no  mention  of  the  basis  and 
background  for  the  creation  of  the  ESP  process  that  is  in  fact  driving  this  entire  application. 
(0020-1-7  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  DRN  maintains  that  issuance  of  an  ESP  and  building  a  nuclear  power  plant  are 
connected  actions  and  that  all  four  of  the  above  requirements  apply  to  the  ultimate  use  of  this 


NUREG-2168

property.  Therefore,  the  NRC  has  acted  in  an  arbitrary  and  capricious  fashion;  first  by  modifying 
the  original  regulations  implementing  the  ESP  permit  to  no  longer  look  at  the  design  of  a  power 
plant  and  second  by  not  preparing  one  comprehensive  EIS  in  order  to  properly  analyze  the  true 
impacts  associated  with  the  site  and  a  proposal  to  build  a  nuclear  power  plant.  Preparing  an 
EIS  for  only  the  ESP  and  not  the  power  plant  violates  NEPA  by  segmenting  the  review  of  one 
project  into  two.  (0020-1-9  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  As  explained  in  the  response  to  Comment  20-1-8  in  Section  E.2. 1  on  the  ESP 
process,  the  cited  modification  to  the  regulations  was  to  move  the  quoted  text,  not  delete  it. 
Therefore,  the  "effects  of  construction  and  operation  of  a  reactor,  or  reactors,  which  have 
characteristics  that  fall  within  the  postulated  site  parameters"  are  still  considered  in  NRC  draft 
EISs  for  ESPs.  The  NRC  has  not  changed  the  level  of  design  information  it  requires  applicants 
to  submit  in  ESP  applications  since  it  created  the  ESP  process  with  its  promulgated  10  CFR  52 
in  1989.  See  54  FR  15372  (Apr.  18,  1989). 

Further,  the  NRC  has  not  engaged  in  unlawful  segmentation.  The  EIS  has  considered  the 
environmental  impacts  of  construction  and  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant,  using  the  plant 
parameters  described  in  the  ESP  application.  If,  in  the  future,  an  applicant  submits  an 
application  for  a  CP  or  COL  referencing  the  PSEG  ESP,  the  NRC  will  prepare  a  supplement  to 
the  EIS  prepared  for  the  PSEG  ESP  to  consider  whether  there  are  any  substantial  changes  and 
significant  new  circumstances  or  information  that  were  not  evaluated  in  the  ESP  EIS.  This 
approach  ensures  that  the  agency's  decision  regarding  construction  and  operation  of  a  facility 
will  continue  to  be  informed  by  the  NEPA-required  hard  look  at  the  environmental  impacts  of  the 
proposed  action.  No  changes  to  the  EIS  were  made  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

E.2.38  General  Comments  in  Opposition  to  Nuclear  Power 

Comment:  This  proposal,  to  build  another  nuclear  plant,  and  the  EIS,  the  Draft  EIS,  are  both, 
in  our  opinion,  failures.  Neither  is  solving  the  problem  that  we  are  burdening  future  generations 
with.  The  people  here,  from  the  NRC,  and  the  people  here  from  PSEG,  know  that  your  job  is 
nuclear.  But  our  future  is  not,  and  should  not,  be  nuclear.  (0006-4-17  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  So,  if  each  of  us  leaves  behind  the  company,  PSEG,  and  its  biased  one-sided 
analysis,  and  all  of  you  at  the  NRC,  with  your  seemingly  potentially  mono-minded  approach  of  I 
never  saw  a  nuclear  power  plant  that  I  didn't  like,  we  are  left  with  one  conclusion.  One 
conclusion.  In  this  day  and  age,  building  another  nuclear  power  plant  is  the  stupidest  decision 
anyone  could  ever  make,  since  all  we  are  doing  is  hurting  the  chance  that  our  children,  and  our 
grandchildren,  will  ever  have  the  opportunity  for  a  sustainable  and  livable  future,  on  this  planet. 
(0006-4-2  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  So  we  need  to  look  at  these  issues  more  seriously.  And  I  think  we  can  create  a 
better  future,  for  our  children,  again  I  think  that  is  one  of  the  most  important  factors  lost  in  this 
EIS,  and  the  livability  of  the  planet.  And  the  last  time  I  checked,  we  are  not  going  in  the  right 
direction  there  either.  So  my  advice,  to  the  NRC,  is  an  old  slogan,  and  I  say  it  simply  this  way, 
just  say  no.  No  to  this  nuclear  power  plant.  And  watch,  watch  how  PSEG  will  find  other,  less 
damaging  ways,  to  produce  our  electricity  in  a  way  that  will  protect  us  all.  (0006-4-20  [Brook, 
David])

Comment:  So  we  must  start  making  different  energy  decisions,  and  not  maintain  the  status 
quo.  Nuclear  energy  is  not  a  solution,  it  is  actually  part  of  the  problem.  (0006-4-5  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  So  I  think  we  could  sit  here  and  debate,  you  know,  the  environmental  implication  of 
nuclear  power,  and  many  other  things,  in  the  EIS  statement.  But  I  really  would  call  on  a 
moratorium  on  licensing  renewals,  and  expansion,  until  the  current  waste  issue  is  removed  and 
solved.  No  debate.  (0007-11-12  [Spencer,  Scott]) 

Comment:  And  then  the  big  picture,  as  a  couple  of  people  have  talked  about,  I  think  we  need 
to  look  at  where  are  we  going,  as  a  culture,  as  a  regional  area,  and  as  a  country.  And  this 
proposed  nuclear  facility  would  add  at  least  one,  and  it  sounds  like  there  could  be  more  than 
one,  nuclear  reactor  proposed  on  this  site.  And  if  they  are  built,  or  if  even  one  is  built,  my 
understanding  is  that  it  would  be  the  largest  nuclear  production  facility  in  the  country.  And  I  find 
that  shocking.  That  in  this  day  and  age  we  are  not  talking  about  retiring  nuclear.  I  know  they 
are  doing  it  in  Vermont,  they  are  retiring  the  plant  up  there,  they  are  retiring  a  plant  in  California. 
And  I  think  that  that  is  the  way  we  should  be  thinking,  not  adding  more  nuclear  generation.  I 
don't  believe  it  is  green,  it  has  some  attributes  that  are  green.  (0007-13-4  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  I  was  at  the  meeting  across  the  river.  And  it  seemed  like  it  was  really  full  of  people 
who  were  very  happy  with  PSEG,  for  reclaiming  the  marshes.  And  I  had  just  spent  the  last  two 
winters  walking  with  friends  from  New  England,  including  people  from  Fukushima,  for  peace. 
And  had  heard  the  stories  of  survivors  of  Fukushima.  And  while  I  was  walking  I  encountered 
people  who  told  me  a  little  bit  more  about  the  nuclear  power  industry,  the  nuclear  weapons 
industry,  and  the  risks  that  we  are  facing.  The  technology  that  we  are  now  using  to  nuclear 
power,  is  related  to  nuclear  weapons.  It  was  not  the  only  technology  available.  This  technology 
was  chosen,  as  far  as  I  understand,  because  it  dovetailed  neatly  with  nuclear  weapons.  As  long 
as  we  produce  nuclear  power,  as  long  as  we  have  this  industry,  we  will  be  at  risk  from  nuclear 
weapons.  (0007-4-1  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Comment:  I  remember  Jaczko,  who  was  working  with  the  NRC,  and  how  he  left  shortly  after 
he  was  the  single  person  who  said  he  didn't  want  to  see  a  new  plant  built.  Was  it  in  Georgia? 
There  was  an  --  he  said,  after  Fukushima,  how  could  he  sign  off  on  that?  (0007-4-8  [Campion, 
Mary]) 

Comment:  I  think  that  is  most  of  what  I  have  to  say.  Think  about  who  you  are,  think  about  your 
family,  think  about  your  daughter,  think  about  your  grandchildren,  think  about  what  will  happen 
seven  generations  from  now.  And  remember  that  the  choices  that  we  make  will  also  affect 
them.  (0007-4-11  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Comment:  As  we  heard  tonight  all  about  the  positives  of  nuclear  energy,  and  I  cannot  see  any 
positives  about  it.  It  is  a  massive  destructive  technology.  In  order  to  exist  around  it  you  have  to 
have  an  evacuation  zone  and  planning.  (0008-9-1  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  In  my  opinion,  nuclear  power  is  inherently  dangerous,  excessively  costly,  and 
potential  devastating  to  our  environment.  (0010-2  [Cannon,  John])

Comment:  I  cannot  understand  why  you  would  consider  building  any  more  nuclear  power 
plants  when  there  is  still  no  effective,  sustainable  method  of  waste  storage,  far  cleaner  energy 
sources  are  available,  and  the  damage  that  has  already  been  done  is  real.  (0024-1  [Doyle, 

Kathy]) 

Comment:  As  a  resident  of  New  Castle  County  and  our  planet,  I  do  not  want  to  see  more 
nuclear  power  plants,  near  me  or  anywhere.  I  do  not  believe  there  is  such  a  thing  as  "safe" 
nuclear  power  plant.  I  would  much  rather  see  phasing  out  of  existing  nuclear  plants  and 
development  of  sustainable  power  sources  such  as  solar  (and  wind,  if  wisely  sited).  (0026-1 
[Blair,  Kathy]) 

Comment:  Nuclear  energy  is  neither  safe  nor  environmentally  friendly.  What  should  be 
expanded  are  energy  sources  such  as  solar  and  wind,  not  nuclear  power.  PSEG's  slogan  is, 
"We  make  things  work  for  you."  This  proposal  runs  counter  to  that  promise.  (0030-2  [Riddle, 
Frances]) 

Comment:  Alternative  fuels  for  energy  production  are  preferable  for  the  future  health  of 
populations  and  of  the  planet,  rather  than  investing  in  at  least  40-50  years  more  of  nuclear 
technology.  For  example,  the  University  of  Delaware  Energy  Institute  has  expertise  and  is  a 
resource  for  collaborative  efforts  for  energy  efficiency,  alternative  and  emerging  energy 
technologies.  (0032-10  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  Conservation,  energy  efficiency,  and  sustainability  of  energy  resources  are 
preferable.  Nuclear  technology  poses  health  and  safety  risks  in  perpetuity.  Alternative  energies 
are  safer  and  are  more  widely  used  in  several  other  countries.  (0032-5  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  Concerned  scientist  with  respect  for  the  environment.  As  regards  nuclear  power,  a 
student  of  why  we  should  not  rape  the  earth  when  the  problem  of  waste  has  still  not  been 
solved.  (0040-1  [Roberts,  Debra]) 

Comment:  Although  nuclear  energy  will  add  less  pollution  to  the  atmosphere,  it  poses  a 
serious  danger  of  radiation  contamination.  Technology  to  contain  the  waste  materials  is  not 
sufficient.  (0043-1  [Cassling,  Margaret]) 

Comment:  Spending  public  and/or  private  money  in  the  billions  of  dollars  on  this  old 
technology  is  misguided.  All  efforts  should  be  focused  on  renewables.  Wind  power,  solar,  and 
water  power  can  provide  what  we  need.  Investing  in  these  new  technologies  will  also  produce 
more  jobs  and  economic  prosperity.  Renewables  also  would  provide  real  energy 
independence.  Not  the  temporary  fix,  but  a  constant  source  of  energy.  These  sources  also 
provide  resilience  in  times  of  crisis,  since  the  energy  is  produced  close  to  where  it  is  consumed. 
(0043-2  [Cassling,  Margaret]) 

Comment:  Our  children's  future  depends  on  choosing  the  right  energy  source  now.  Short  term 
profits  should  not  cloud  the  issue.  The  choice  is  clear-no  new  nuclear  power  plants.  (0043-3 
[Cassling,  Margaret]) 

Comment:  Nuclear  power  may  seem  clean,  but  rarely  do  people  factor  in  the  spent  radioactive 
rods  that  have  to  be  stored  for  decades  and  decades,  and  are  extremely  hazardous.  There's 


November  2015 


E-223

Appendix  E 


also  the  chance  of  a  partial  or  full  meltdown,  which  would  be  a  catastrophe  given  the  large 
population  in  the  Wilmington/Philadelphia  region.  Trying  to  evacuate  the  region  would  be  a 
nightmare  and  there  would  be  great  loss  of  life.  (0044-2  [Slack,  Gary]) 

Comment:  The  states  of  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  and  Pennsylvania  can  have  a  needed  power 
supply  other  than  nuclear,  they  just  have  to  support  and  invest  in  solar,  wind,  and  water  power. 
Even  natural  gas  would  be  an  easily  obtainable  source  for  power  needs.  It  may  seem  easier  to 
just  keep  with  nuclear  or  coal  power,  but  these  are  not  acceptable  sources  for  the  near  or 
distant  future.  (0044-3  [Slack,  Gary]) 

Comment:  After  the  disaster  in  Fukishima,  the  insanity  of  nuclear  power  has  been  exposed. 

We  can  not  continue  down  this  path  any  longer.  Doing  so  is  inviting  disaster.  The  existing 
plants  should  be  shut  down  as  well.  (0045-3  [Durnan,  Alexander]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  opposition  to  nuclear  power  in  general.  These 
comments  do  not  provide  any  specific  information  relating  to  the  environmental  effects  of  the 
proposed  action.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

E.2.39  General  Comments  in  Opposition  to  the  Existing  Plant 

Comment:  We  believe  that,  before  PSEG  should  be  allowed  to  construct  another  burdensome 
facility  on  Artificial  Island,  or  anywhere  within  the  Delaware  Estuary  before  it  is  even  considered, 
they  must  be  forced  to  minimize  the  adverse  environmental  impact  their  existing  facilities 
already  have.  Including  their  fish  kills,  their  harmful  imprint  on  our  wetlands,  the  water  quality 
impacts  they  have  on  the  Delaware  Estuary  waters,  and  more.  (0004-3-5  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  And  how  about  the  impact  to  the  environment?  The  Delaware  Riverkeeper  Network 
works  to  protect  and  enhance  the  Delaware  River,  and  the  lands  that  drain  into  it.  We  take  that 
role  very  seriously.  You  could  say  that  we  speak  for  the  fish.  Well,  if  the  fish  could  speak,  right 
now,  they  would  tell  you  that  another  nuclear  power  plant  would  not  be  good  for  their  future. 
Already,  already,  millions  offish  are  being  constantly  killed,  by  PSEG,  and  its  cooling  water 
intakes  used  for  the  existing  plants.  Some  of  those  fish  are  endangered  species.  And  it  will 
only  get  worse  with  one  more  nuclear  plant  sucking  ever  more  water,  and  ever  more  fish.  (0006- 
4-12  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  But  if  a  facility  is  seemingly  not  competent  to  run  the  three  reactors  they  already 
have,  I  don't  understand  why  we  are  even  considering  allowing  them  to  build  a  fourth  one,  or 
potentially  more.  (0007-5-12  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  And  I  would  like  to  point  out  Salem's  troubled  past.  I  appreciate  all  the  folks  who 
work  there  who,  I'm  sure,  are  very  responsible.  But  this  is  a  facility  that  has  repeatedly  had 
incidents,  as  recently,  major  incidents,  as  recently  as  May  of  this  year.  At  least  15  bolts,  at  least 
15  broken  bolts  were  found  in  this  facility,  during  a  routine  fuel  change.  And  I'm  not  exactly  sure 
how  long  those  bolts  were  broken.  I  don't  think  anyone  is  sure  of  that.  But  I  do  know,  from  what 
I  read  in  the  paper,  that  they've  known  that  since  at  least  the  mid-1990s  that  those  bolts  could 
present  a  problem.  And  that,  obviously,  wasn't  addressed  since  they  were  still  in  there,  in  2004. 
So  I'm  concerned  that  if  this  facility  has  such  great  safety  record,  things  like  that  continue  to 


NUREG-2168

happen.  Adding  another  doesn't  necessarily  seem  like  the  most  wise,  until  we  get  the  current 
problems,  like  that,  straightened  out.  (0008-4-11  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  Now,  the  gentlemen  here  who  want  work,  they  could  take  those  [two  existing 
PSEG]  plants,  for  25  years,  and  tear  them  down  and  guarantee  the  safety  of  the  public,  that  we 
all  so  love,  and  this  world.  (0008-9-8  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  PSEG  has  not  upgraded  the  original  water  cooling  systems  installed  in  the  70s  on 
Salem  #1  and  #2.  This  system  just  takes  in  millions  of  gallons  of  water  and  discharges  waste 
heat  back  into  the  river.  This  is  the  least  efficient  cooling  system  used  in  power  plants.  How 
can  a  company  with  this  type  of  planning  be  trusted  with  another  plant?  (0011-4  [Keating, 
Thomas]) 

Comment:  Only  the  most  blindered  view  could  consider  adding  to  a  complex  which  has  not 
been  operated  to  the  highest  possible  standard  for  safety.  The  massive  and  unexplained  (pipe, 
underneath)  tritium  leak  is  one  example.  The  recent,  but  long  unattended  failure  of  unsafe  bolts 
is  also  revealing.  (0047-2  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Response:  These  comments  express  opposition  to  the  existing  units  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
Cumulative  impacts,  including  the  continued  operation  of  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS,  are 
addressed  in  Chapter  7  of  the  EIS.  The  assessment  includes  consideration  of  the  issues 
mentioned  in  the  comments,  including  water  consumption  and  impacts  to  fish  and  other  aquatic 
ecological  resources.  These  comments  provide  no  new  information  for  consideration,  and 
therefore,  no  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

E.2.40  Comments  Concerning  Issues  Outside  Scope  -  Emergency  Preparedness 

Comment:  And,  also,  preventing  the  ability  of  emergency  services,  and  equipment,  to  arrive  at 
the  site  if,  in  fact,  we  do  have  a  catastrophic  event  and  we  need  those  services  provided.  (0004- 
3-7  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  So  we  have  this  heightened  risk  of,  again,  catastrophic  event,  and  an  inability  of 
emergency  services  to  appropriately  respond.  And  we  think  that,  that  has  not  been 
appropriately  addressed  in  the  NRC  review.  (0004-3-9  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  From  a  safety  issue  I'm  also  deeply  concerned  that,  you  know,  we've  made  this 
assumption  that  no  one  in  Delaware  cares,  we  can't  get  people  to  come  out  for  evacuations. 
Well,  it  takes  some  time  and  effort  to  engage  them,  when  you  have  cut  them  out  for  five 
decades,  as  we  have  done  in  Delaware.  When  I  go  through  developments  like  Odessa 
National,  Odessa  Chase,  and  I  talk  to  residents,  they  see  a  tower  there,  they  don't  even  know 
what  is  over  there.  You  know,  you  have  the  alarm  thing  go  off  every  now  and  then.  Well,  what 
is  that  thing  going  off,  when  you  have  your  periodic  testing  that  we  can't  even  speak  to  each 
other  out  in  that  area.  (0007-2-16  [Carter.  David]) 

Comment:  And  then  they  get  really  confused  when  they  get  this  thing  that  says  come  get  your 
iodine  tablets.  I  speak  to  these  people  all  the  time.  And  this  is  because  of  a  complete  failure  to 
do  an  effective  outreach  program  with  these  communities,  to  let  them  know  what  is  going  on.

And  the  same  way  that  we  had  to  fight  so  hard  to  get  this  group  to  come  over  here  and  speak 
about  this  issue.  (0007-2-17  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  Even  issues  like  coordination  with  the  new  Route  301,  that  is  going  to  drive  hordes 
of  people,  if  we  have  an  evacuation,  towards  the  fallout  zone,  instead  of  to  a  safety  zone,  if  you 
live  in  Middletown,  and  Southern  New  Castle  County,  up  over  the  Roth  Bridge,  and  not  away 
from  it.  It  all  needs  to  be  evaluated.  Do  we  have  other  routes  to  get  out  to  213,  will  the  roads 
handle  it,  how  are  we  going  to  handle  that?  (0007-2-18  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  When  I  heard  about  the  possible  safety,  when  I  heard  that  there  would  be  no 
socioeconomic  discrepancy  or  risk,  I  was  thinking  about  the  evacuation  report  that  I  read  this 
morning,  that  said  that  people  without  motor  vehicles  will  go  out  and  wait  at  the  nearest 
available  bus  stop,  for  public  transportation,  to  bring  them  out  of  the  danger  zone,  of  this  power 
plant.  (0007-4-4  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Comment:  The  impacts  of  sea  level  rise,  and  flooding,  are  compounding  with  the  impacts  of 
environmental  justice.  In  the  event  of  a  bad  storm,  that  could  cause  a  power  outage,  or  some 
kind  of  emergency  at  the  nuclear  plant,  there  would  also  be  an  emergency,  here  in  Delaware, 
because  of  the  floodwater.  The  people  who  live  most  adjacent  to  the  nuclear  reactor,  in  New 
Jersey,  end  up  here  in  Delaware,  are  already  living  in  an  extremely  vulnerable  area  to  flooding 
from  sea  level  rise  and,  even,  just  from  regular  storms.  In  the  event  of  a  storm,  bad  enough  to 
cause  an  emergency  over  at  the  nuclear  reactor,  those  people  would  almost,  one  hundred 
percent,  I'm  sure  be  flooded  into  their  communities,  which  several  of  them  only  have  one  or  two 
roads  in  and  out,  and  they  are  very  flood  prone.  So  that  is  assuming,  again,  that  they  even 
have  a  car  to  get  in  and  drive  if  the  roads  aren't  flooded.  The  ten  mile  evacuation  zone,  I  think, 
is  inadequate,  as  is  the  50  mile  suit  safety  zone,  as  we  have  seen  with  Fukushima.  (0007-5-9 
[Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  What  if,  I'm  also  concerned  that  if  there  were  an  emergency  at  one  of  the 
dangerous  facilities,  for  lack  of  a  better  word,  than  dangerous,  I  think  there  is  a  more  technical 
term  that  isn't  coming  to  me.  If  there  were  an  incident  at  one  of  the  facilities,  within  the  ten  mile 
zone,  say  the  Delaware  State  Refinery,  or  the  Sulfuric  Acid  Regeneration  Plant,  that  could 
cause  evacuation  of  the  area,  who  would  be  running  the  nuclear  power  plant,  what  would 
happen  with  that,  to  prevent  a  disaster  if  the  area  that  the  power  plant  is  in,  had  to  be 
evacuated.  (0008-4-4  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  And  that  the  impacts  of  environmental  justice,  and  sea  level  rise,  are  compounding 
in  that  the  communities  living  within  ten  miles  of  the  facility,  also  live  in  an  extremely  vulnerable 
area  to  sea  level  rise,  and  would  not  necessarily  be  able  to  get  out  in  the  event  of  an 
emergency.  Particularly  if  that  emergency  was  caused  by  a  weather  disaster  that  also  caused 
flooding.  That  is  even  assuming  that  they  did  have  a  car  to  get  out.  If  they  didn't  have  a  car 
they  would  really  be  out  of  luck.  And  that  is  a  relatively  large  assumption  that  everybody  has  a 
car.  (0008-4-7  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  I  think  that  the  ten  mile  evacuation  area  is  grossly  inadequate,  as  we  have  seen 
with  Fukushima,  where  at  least  88  miles  around  that  incident  are  totally  unlivable,  and  unusable.

test  if  the  system  works.  (0008-9-3  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  The  crucial  planning  will  come  not  with  the  Early  Site  Permit  but  with  the  actual 
details  of  the  plant  design.  My  questions  would  include:  concern  for  extreme  floods  and 
adequate  entrance  and  egress  systems,  maintaining  a  good,  continuous  dialog  with  the

water  with  only  the  current  location  of  Salem  1  and  2  and  Hope  Creek  Generating  stations 
above  ground,  likely  due  to  associated  fill.  The  same  would  most  certainly  become  true  with 
construction  of  a  new  facility,  placing  this  fourth  nuclear  plant  out  of  reach  from  emergency 
response  personnel  during  foreseeable  high  hazard  periods  when  emergency  response 
capabilities  would  be  an  obvious  potential  need.  (0020-5-14  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  These  comments  deal  with  emergency  preparedness  and/or  emergency  response 
actions  and,  as  such,  are  outside  the  scope  of  the  environmental  review  that  is  the  subject  of 
this  EIS.  An  evaluation  of  emergency  preparedness  issues  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  staff's 
SER  (see  10  CFR  52. 18).  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

E.2.41  Comments  Concerning  Issues  Outside  Scope  -  Miscellaneous 

Comment:  Executive  Order  13547  was  issued  from  the  President's  office  in  July  2010  to 
establish  a  National  Policy  for  Stewardship  of  the  Ocean  and  Coasts,  as  well  as  the  formulation 
of  the  National  Ocean  Council  (NOC)  to  advance  policy  in  a  Strategic  Action  Planter  resiliency 
and  adaptation  to  climate  change;  all  of  this  using  Ecosystem-Based  Management  (EBM) 
strategies;  and  recognizing  that  climate  change  exacerbates  existing  stresses  and  negatively 
impacts  communities  that  rely  on  natural  resources  for  their  livelihood  and  economic  prosperity. 
As  part  of  this  effort,  the  Federal  government  is  developing  a  National  Fish,  Wildlife,  and  Plants 
Climate  Adaptation  Strategy,  and  Congress  called  for  this  strategy  to  be  co-Led  by  U.S.  Fish 
and  Wildlife  Service  (USFWS),  NOAA,  CEQ,  and  State  wildlife  agencies.  (0002-3  [Weinstein, 
Michael]) 

Comment:  [W]hether  it  is  the  federal  actions  for  a  climate  resilient  nation,  President  Obama's 
Executive  Order  13547,  or  the  National  Ocean  Council's  Strategic  Plan,  Strategic  Action  Plan 
for  Resiliency  and  Adaptation,  all  of  these  documents,  and  federal,  state,  and  local  efforts, 
recognize  that  climate  change  exacerbates  existing  stresses,  and  negatively  impacts 
communities  that  rely  on  natural  resources  for  their  livelihood  and  economic  prosperity.  (0004-9- 
4  [Weinstein,  Michael]) 

Response:  The  NRC  is  not  responsible  for  establishing  policies  related  to  global  warming  or 
climate  change.  While  it  is  recognized  that  these  issues  are  of  national  importance,  setting 
policy  for  global  warming  or  climate  is  outside  the  scope  of  the  review  in  this  EIS.  No  changes 
were  made  to  the  E/S  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  [Nuclear  power  plants]  is  staged  nuclear  weapons,  as  well,  that  is  all  it  is.  That  is 
where  they  get  nuclear  weapons  from.  It  has  been  used  in  the  military,  it  is  a  military  science.

Appendix  E 


And  it  is  now  dated  science.  You  can't  even  use  nuclear  weapons.  The  present  administration 
has  just  decided  to  sign  off  on  another  1 .3  trillion  dollars,  are  rebuilding  the  nuclear  arsenal,  for 
weapons  they  can't  use,  which  should  be  used  for  various  societal  purposes.  (0008-9-2  [August, 
Bernard]) 

Response:  While  this  comment  is  outside  the  scope  of  the  review  in  this  EIS,  the  NRC 
disagrees  with  the  commenter's  statement  regarding  nuclear  power  plants  as  producers  of 
material  for  nuclear  weapons.  In  part  to  help  ensure  non-proliferation  of  nuclear  material,  the 
NRC  regulations  require  strict  control,  management,  and  accountability  of  all  nuclear  fuel, 
whether  new  fuel  or  spent  fuel,  at  a  nuclear  power  plant  site  as  a  matter  of  law.  The  NRC's  key 
regulations  in  this  area  (10  CFR  73,  74,  and  95)  provide  comprehensive  requirements  governing 
the  control  of,  and  access  to,  information,  physical  security  of  materials  and  facilities,  and 
material  control  and  accounting.  Completely  separate  from  the  NRC's  regulatory  authority,  the 
U.S.  Department  of  Energy  has  legal  authority  for  maintaining  and  managing  the  U.S.  nuclear 
weapons.  Additionally,  the  length  of  time  a  fuel  bundle  is  used  to  produce  electricity  is  typically 
2  or  3  cycles  of  approximately  18  to  24  months  per  cycle  of  electrical  power  production.  The 
isotropic  makeup  of  the  plutonium  (Pu)  within  the  spent  nuclear  fuel  from  such  time  in  a  nuclear 
core  results  in  relatively  high  isotropic  concentrations  of  non- Pu -2 39  nuclides  (e.g.,  Pu-238  and 
Pu-240).  The  high  levels  of  Pu-238,  Pu-240,  and  heavier  isotopes  of  plutonium  in  the  spent 
nuclear  fuel  from  U.S.  commercial  nuclear  power  plants  would  make  the  plutonium,  if  extracted 
from  the  spent  nuclear  fuel,  not  usable  for  nuclear  weapons.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS 
as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  I  wish  to  state  that  the  following  opinion  is  not  directed  at  you  or  your  co-worker 
who  are  trying  to  figure  this  mess  out.  I  think  I  express  the  opinion  of  many  of  my  fellow  citizens 
when  I  say  that  the  nuclear  industry  and  regulatory  agencies  have  a  strong  record  of  not  being 
straight  with  the  public.  They  only  tell  half-truths  when  their  lips  are  moving.  This  goes  back  to 
before  the  Manhattan  Project.  Not  straight  with  the  people  of  the  Marshall  Islands,  not  straight 
with  Army  personnel  involved  in  bomb  tests,  not  straight  with  people  downwind  of  tests,  the  list 
is  endless.  (0046-3  [Campion,  George]) 

Response:  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  Additionally,  in  its  transmission  [line]  analysis,  PSEG  should  examine  the 
transmission  loss  between  the  source  and  end  users  when  transporting  electricity  over  such  a 
great  distance.  (0020-4-19  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  proposed  action  before  the  NRC  is  the  issuance  or  denial  of  an  ESP  for  the 
PSEG  Site,  and  as  such,  it  does  not  include  the  construction  and  operation  of  new  transmission 
lines  to  support  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Thus,  any  technical  assessment 
of  new  transmission  lines  by  PSEG  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  EIS.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

Comment:  We  believe  that  the  Army  Corps  is  ignoring  President  Obama’s  Executive  Order  on 
climate  change.  (0016-2  [Tittel,  Jeff])

E.2.43  Comments  Concerning  Issues  Outside  Scope  -  Safety 

Comment:  Finally,  although  this  does  not  relate  directly  to  the  environmental  impacts  of  the 
new  plant,  I  would  add  these  thoughts  on  the  prospects  of  global  climate  change.  As  an 
environmental  scientist,  I  believe  it  is  no  exaggeration  to  say  that  climate  change  represents  the 
singular  environmental  threat  of  the  coming  century.  Even  for  the  development  of  the  new 
plant,  the  reality  of  sea  level  rise  is  a  factor  that  must  be  and  is  being  taken  into  account  into  the 
new  facility.  (0001-9  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Comment:  [WJhile  this  does  not  directly  relate  to  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  new  plant,  I 
would  add  these  thoughts  on  the  prospects  of  global  climate  change.  As  an  environmental 
scientist,  and  geochemist,  I  believe  it  is  no  exaggeration  to  say  that  climate  change  represents  a 
singular  environmental  threat  of  the  coming  century.  Even  for  the  development  of  the  new 
plant,  the  reality  still  is  factor  that  is  must  be  and  is  being  taken  into  account  for  in  the  new 
facility.  (0004-11-9  [Velinsky,  David]) 

Comment:  Sea  level  rise  and  storm  surge  are,  also,  a  concern  at  the  proposed  facility.  Critical 
structures  should  be  elevated,  or  water  proofed,  at  an  appropriate  elevation,  to  ensure  their 
protection.  The  NRC  should  review  these  design  plans  to  confirm  that  they  are  protected  for 
sea  level  rise.  (0004-16-11  [Molzahn,  Robert]) 

Comment:  But  I  did  want  to  raise  one  issue  for  the  record,  today.  And  that  is  the  concern  we 
have  about  the  location  being  proposed  for  construction  of  this  new  nuclear  plant.  They  are 
proposing  to  construct  Salem  4  in  a  reach  of  the  river  that  already  is  well  recognized  to  be 
increasingly  impacted  by  climate  change,  sea  level  rise,  and  storm  surge,  in  the  coming  years. 
We  already  have  two  facilities  located  in  this  area  that  we  know,  based  upon  existing  and 
emerging  science,  is  going  to  be  subject  to  dangerous  inundation  by  flood  waters,  or 
surrounded  by  flood  waters,  raising  the  potential  for  catastrophic  events.  (0004-3-6  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Comment:  So  when  one  looks  at  all  of  the  inundation  maps  that  are  coming  out,  from  the 
credible  scientific  research,  we  see  that  already,  by  2050  when  we  have  sea  level  rise,  and  we 
have  storm  events,  where  these  nuclear  facilities  are  going  to  be  located,  on  Artificial  Island  will 
genuinely,  and  literally,  be  an  island  if  they  are  not  inundated.  (0004-3-8  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  Oh,  and  how  about  safety?  It  can't  happen  here,  you  have  heard  this.  That  is  what 
the  Japanese  said,  that  is  what  other  places  have  said,  it  can’t  happen  here.  But  think  about  it, 
four  nuclear  power  plants  sitting  right  next  to  each  other  is  really  not  too  smart.  Considering 
that,  right  now,  52  percent  or  more  of  New  Jersey's  electricity  is  being  relied  upon,  on  them,  one 
bad  burp  from  one  of  those  plants,  and  half  of  New  Jersey  could  be  plunged  into  darkness  for  a 
very  long  time.  For  those  of  us  who  have  experienced  Sandy  it  will  make  those  weeks,  without

power,  seem  like  a  nanosecond  in  time,  for  the  52  percent  of  the  state  seeking  to  replace  that 
power.  (0006-4-10  [Brook,  David]) 

Comment:  Sea  level  rise  and  storm  surge  is  also  a  concern  at  the  proposed  facility.  Critical 
structures  should  be  elevated,  or  waterproofed,  in  an  appropriate  elevation.  NRC  should  review 
the  designs.  (0007-16-10  [Palmer,  Dennis]) 

Comment:  In  addition  sea  level  rise  is  another  concern.  This  has  come  up  before,  too,  with 
some  of  the  previous  speakers.  Certainly  this  has  to  be  taken  into  account.  It  has  been  taken 
into  account.  And  one  of  the  keys  here  is  elevation  and,  certainly,  that  is  being  considered  as 
this  proposal  moves  forward.  (0007-17-4  [DeLuca,  Mike]) 

Comment:  But  some  of  the  really  big  problems  that  seem  to  be  overlooked,  it  is  a  very  low- 
lying  area.  We  are  concerned  about  sea  level  rise.  Our  governor  has  issued  an  executive  order 
that  all  state  agencies  review  impacts  of  sea  level  rise  for  all  plants.  They  recently  did  a  study, 
and  they  only  modeled  it  to  1 .5  feet  rise.  Short-sighted,  totally  inadequate,  and  just  plain  wrong. 
It  is  bad  science,  based  on  what  is  coming  out  of  the  new  NOAA  reports,  the  UPCC  reports  that 
are  coming  out,  completely  inadequate.  Particularly  in  light  of  the  fact  that  you've  extended  the 
life  of  this  facility  for  60  years,  and  another  60  years  coming  in,  that  is  120  years  from  now.  You 
have  a  responsibility  to  look  at  where  that  water  is  going  to  be  long-term.  And  the  modeling  that 
was  done  was  completely  inadequate.  I  actually  believe  you  should  be  required  to  model  for 
sea  level  rise,  based  on  the  half  life  of  the  50  years  of  radioactive  waste  you  are  storing  on  that 
site  (0007-2-6  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  I  agree  one  hundred  percent  with  Dave  Carter  about  the  concerns  about  sea  level 
rise,  the  short-sightedness  of  using  only  1 .5  meters.  I  realize  that  that  is  what,  generally,  is 
used  when  scientists  talk  about  sea  level  rise,  by  the  year  2100.  But  given  that  it  is  now  2014, 
2100,  in  the  scope  of  nuclear  half  life  is  really  not  that  far  away.  (0007-5-6  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  Finally,  although  this  doesn't  relate  directly  to  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  new 
plant,  I  would  add  these  thoughts  on  the  prospect  of  global  climate  change.  As  someone  who 
works  in  the  interface  of  science  and  policy,  I  believe  it  is  no  exaggeration  to  say  that  climate 
change  represents  the  singular  environmental  threat  in  the  coming  century.  Even  for  the 
development  of  the  new  plant,  the  reality  of  sea  level  rise  hasn't  been  mentioned,  it  is  a  factor 
that  must  be,  and  is  being  taken  into  account.  (0007-9-9  [Wall,  Roland]) 

Comment:  I,  and  the  environmental  justice  groups  are  extremely  concerned  about  sea  level 
rise,  and  feel  that  the  seal  level  rise  projects,  taken  into  account  in  the  Draft  Environmental 
Impact  Statement,  are  extremely  short-sighted.  (0008-4-6  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  Salem  nukes  are  built  on  a  sandbar  and  with  rising  sea  levels,  it's  destined  to  go 
under.  What  then?  (0010-3  [Cannon,  John]) 

Comment:  The  plant  sits  on  nothing  but  mud  and  is  sinking.  It  has  always  been  a  low  lying 
swampy  area,  and  still  is.  With  rising  water  levels,  it  is  ridiculous  to  even  consider  this  area. 

High  tides  and  storm  surges  will  flood  the  area  in  years  to  come.  (0011-6  [Keating,  Thomas]) 


NUREG-2168

Appendix  E 


Comment:  In  all  the  literature  I  received,  there  was  no  mention  of  the  possible  effects  of 
flooding  or  rising  sea  level  on  this  low-lying  land  where  the  new  reactor  would  be  located.  One 
of  the  speakers,  Mr.  David  Carter,  brought  this  topic  to  your  attention,  but  it  was  not  addressed 
by  anyone.  (0013-1  [Oppelt,  John]) 

Comment:  The  New  Jersey  Sierra  Club  is  concerned  that  the  Draft  Environmental  Impact 
Statement  has  not  taken  into  account  climate  change.  We  believe  that  the  DEIS  does  not  look 
sufficiently  at  the  impacts  from  flooding,  sea  level  rises,  and  storm  surges.  Storm  and  storm 
surges  are  becoming  worse  and  more  frequent  because  of  climate  change.  The  Delaware 
Bayshore  is  already  seeing  the  impacts  of  climate  change  with  the  erosion  of  coastal  wetlands 
and  areas  flooding  during  normal  high  tides.  The  Delaware  Bayshore  is  eroding  by  1 1  feet  a 
year,  which  is  almost  4  times  faster  than  it  was  ten  years  ago.  The  Bay  itself  has  risen  a  foot  in 
the  last  century,  with  most  of  it  happening  in  the  last  20  years.  It  is  projected  to  rise  by  another 
foot  and  half,  which  is  a  conservative  estimate,  by  2050.  This  is  an  area  where  climate  change 
impacts  will  continue  to  get  worse.  We  believe  the  DEIS  does  not  address  the  impacts  of  storm 
surges  and  flooding  being  made  even  worse  by  a  rising  sea.  (0016-1  [Tittel,  Jeff]) 

Comment:  The  DEIS  is  woefully  inadequate  because  it  does  not  address  climate  change,  sea 
level  rise  and  storm  surges.  This  is  a  very  vulnerable  area.  (0016-3  [Tittel,  Jeff]) 

Comment:  Building  a  facility  of  this  type  in  an  area  that  is  subject  to  increasing  sea  level  rise 
and  storm  surges  is  not  only  bad  for  the  environment,  but  dangerous.  Heavy  River  flooding 
along  with  a  storm  surge  could  cause  a  catastrophic  event.  We  believe  the  DEIS  in  adequate 
and  wrong  because  it  does  not  address  these  issues.  (0016-5  [Tittel,  Jeff]) 

Comment:  The  impacts  of  sea  level  rise  are  not  adequately  addressed  within  the  DEIS 
especially  considering  the  site  is  located  in  a  region  that  will  be  consistently  under  or 
surrounded  by  water  raising  the  potential  for  a  catastrophic  nuclear  event  and  inhibiting  the 
ability  of  emergency  services  to  reach  the  facility  at  times  when  it  will  most  likely  be  needed. 
Although  the  NRC  indicates  that  PSEG  will".. .provide  the  necessary  flood  hazard  analysis  ... 
consistent  with  present-day  guidance  and  methodologies",  and  "PSEG  will  need  to  demonstrate 
and  the  NRC  staff  will  confirm  that  the  hazards  from  flooding  are  acceptable  at  the  PSEG  Site" 
(p  5-99),  there  is  no  analysis  or  evaluation  of  climate  change  when  addressing  the 
Environmental  Impacts  of  Postulated  Accidents  in  Section  5.11.  The  potential  impacts  of 
climate  change  are  mentioned  in  reference  to  cumulative  impacts  to  aquatic  organisms  and 
habitat  and  quickly  dismissed  as  "inconclusive"  (p  7-29).  However,  the  impacts  of  sea  level  rise 
are  consistently  predicted. to  be  greater  within  the  Delaware  Bay  and  Estuary  than  elsewhere  in 
the  Mid-Atlantic,  thus  raising  the  concerns  for  placement  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  on  wetlands  at 
the  water's  edge.  (0020-5-12  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  Inundation  maps  for  future  decades  consistently  show  that  with  sea  level  rise,  the 
proposed  location  of  the  new  nuclear  facility  will  be  inundated  and/or  surrounded  by  water;  with, 
at  best,  the  nuclear  plant  (because  of  fill)  being  located  on  an  island  surrounded  by  water  thus 
impeding  emergency  response  that  is  a  foreseeable  need  in  the  wake  of  future  storm  events.  A 
2008  study  [see  UPenn  Department  of  City  and  Regional  Planning.  2008.  Climate  Change: 
Impacts  and  Responses  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin]  by  the  University  of  Pennsylvania

2100  with  sea  level  rise.  The  maps  show  Artificial  Island  becoming  a  true  island  by  2050, 
surrounded  by  water  with  only  the  current  location  of  Salem  1  and  2  and  Hope  Creek 
Generating  stations  above  ground,  likely  due  to  associated  fill.  (0020-5-13  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  According  to  the  University  of  Pennsylvania  study  and  ongoing  research  by  others, 
storm  surges  will  make  matters  even  worse  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  watershed  with  storms 
becoming  more  intense,  having  higher  wind  speeds  as  well  as  heavier  precipitation;  Nor'easters 
becoming  more  frequent;  an  increasing  probability  of  severe  hurricanes  in  the  mid-Atlantic 
region;  and  the  combination  of  storm  surge  and  sea  level  rise  moving  the  zone  of  impact  further 
inland.  (0020-5-15  [van  Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  An  April  2014  study  [see  Strauss  et  al.  (2014).  "New  Jersey  and  the  Surging  Sea: 

A  Vulnerability  Assessment  With  Projections  for  Sea  Level  Rise  and  Coastal  Flood  Risk." 
Climate  Central  Research  Report,  pp  1-43]  released  by  Climate  Central  also  talks  about  sea 
level  rise  and  its  impacts  on  New  Jersey,  including  Salem  County  which  is  among  the  areas  in 
the  State  the  report  predicts  will  experience  high  impacts  from  flooding  due  to  sea  level  rise. 
According  to  the  Surging  Seas  Risk  Finder  website  [see 

http://scalevel.climatecentral.org/ssrf/new-jersey],  analysis  associated  with  the  Climate  Central 
report,  there  is  a  greater  than  50%  chance  of  at  least  one  flood  of  6  feet  in  the  New  Jersey  area 
by  the  year  2050  and  a  99%  risk  of  at  least  one  flood  exceeding  9  feet  by  the  year  2100.  At 
these  levels,  and  even  far  lower,  this  analysis  shows  water  cutting  off  the  existing  and  proposed 
power  plant  areas,  increasing  the  likelihood  of  hazard.  At  7  feet,  one  of  the  nuclear  plants  on 
Artificial  Island  is  below  7  feet  and  therefore  directly  at  risk  from  flooding,  with  both  plants  being 
below  9  feet  and  so  at  direct  risk  when  the  waters  reach  those  levels.  (0020-5-16  [van  Rossum, 
Maya]) 

Comment:  Due  to  the  effects  of  climate  change,  including  sea  level  rise,  the  frequency  of  what 
is  now  considered  a  100  year  flood  event  will  increase  substantially.  In  fact,  whether 
considering  low  or  high  emission  scenarios,  the  frequency  of  today's  100-year  flood  event  is 
expected  to  occur,  on  average,  every  four  years  in  Atlantic  City  [see  Frumhoff  et  al.  2007, 
Confronting  Climate  Change  in  the  U.S.  Northeast:  Science,  Impacts,  and  Solutions.  Synthesis 
report  of  the  Northeast  Climate  Impacts  Assessment  (NECIA).  Cambridge,  MA:  Union  of 
Concerned  Scientists  (UCS)].  These  new  and  future  scenarios  need  to  become  part  of  the 
consideration  in  decision-making  included  for  a  new  nuclear  facility.  The  NRC  should  not  issue 
an  ESP  for  a  location  in  an  area  that  will  most  likely  flood  and  be  inundated  by  sea  level  rise.  At 
a  minimum,  climate  and  sea  level  modeling  should  be  evaluated  as  part  of  the  decision-making 
process  instead  of  basing  the  analysis  on  "present-day"  flooding  characteristics  and  dismissing 
the  likelihood  and  risk  associated  with  future  climate  models  as  "inconclusive."  (0020-5-17  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Comment:  The  impacts  of  sea  level  rise  are  not  adequately  addressed  within  the  Draft  EIS 
especially  considering  the  site  is  located  in  a  region  that  will  be  consistently  under  or 
surrounded  by  water  raising  the  potential  for  a  catastrophic  nuclear  event  and  inhibiting  the 
ability  of  emergency  services  to  reach  the  facility  at  times  when  it  will  most  likely  be  needed. 

The  NRC  should  not  issue  an  early  site  permit  for  a  location  in  an  area  that  will  most  likely  flood 
and  be  inundated  by  sea  level  rise  in  the  foreseeable  future  as  is  the  case  at  this  location.

Comment:  Overall,  the  document  does  not  adequately  address  the  likely  impacts  of  climate 
change  (sea  level  rise,  increased  temperature  and  increased  precipitation)  over  the  lifespan  of 
the  proposed  facility.  Although  climate  change  and  sea  level  rise  are  mentioned  several  times 
within  the  text  of  the  DEIS,  it  is  unclear  the  extent  to  which  future  sea  levels  have  truly  been 
taken  into  consideration.  No  future  planning  scenarios  are  provided  to  understand  the 
assumptions  that  were  made  in  site  selection,  alternatives  evaluations  and  cumulative  impact 
assessments.  (0023-2-12  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Comment:  The  final  EIS  should  provide  the  following  information  in  regards  to  climate  change 
and  sea  level  rise:  (1)  The  sea  level  rise  projection  used  in  the  site  selection  and  design  for  this 
project.  (2)  The  maximum  storm  surge  used  in  site  selection  and  design.  (3)  The  current  Mean 
Higher  High  Water  (MHHW)  level  in  the  river  and  adjacent  tributaries,  and  the  elevation  above 
MHHW  of  the  land  surface  as  well  as  the  facility.  (4)  Explain  if  sea  level  rise  and  storm  surges 
were  considered  in  combination.  For  example,  information  should  be  provided  that  explains  the 
implications  of  a  2  meter  sea  level  rise  coupled  with  a  2  meter  storm  surge.  (5)  Sea  level  rise 
will  impact  depth  to  groundwater  and  cause  saltwater  intrusion  into  surface  and  groundwater. 
Information  should  be  provided  that  explains  the  implications  of  rising  water  tables  and  saltwater 
intrusion  on  this  site  and  the  facility.  An  analysis  of  thresholds  for  the  site  should  be  included 
that  establish  the  point  at  which  the  site  would  no  longer  function  as  designed.  Additionally, 
discussion  should  be  included  on  how  site  specific  modeling  will  be  conducted  to  ensure  future 
operational  issues  have  been  evaluated.  (6)  A  discussion  on  the  measures  developed  for  the 
site  to  mitigate  the  potential  for  flooding  during  the  entire  life-span  of  this  facility.  (7)  In  light  of 
increasing  sea  levels,  and  lack  of  permanent  storage  for  spent  fuel,  explanation  is  needed  on 
how  the  facility  will  ensure  protection  of  human  and  ecological  health  during  and  after 
decommissioning.  (0023-2-14  [Cooksey,  Sarah]) 

Comment:  The  proposed  nuclear  reactor(s)  are  sited  in  a  low  lying  coastal  area,  only  slightly 
above  sea  level,  and  subject  to  potential  flooding.  (0032-2  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  Sea  Level  Rise  is  a  recently  identified  factor  because  of  climate  change--do  Flood 
Maps  show  potential  risk  of  flooding  under  conditions  of  such  sea  level  rise?  Such  flooding 
could  be  disastrous  as  in  Fukushima,  Japan.  (0032-3  [Purcell,  Leslie]) 

Comment:  The  impacts  of  sea  level  rise  are  not  adequately  addressed  within  the  Draft  EIS 
especially  considering  the  site  is  located  in  a  region  that  will  be  consistently  under  or 
surrounded  by  water  raising  the  potential  for  a  catastrophic  nuclear  event  and  inhibiting  the 
ability  of  emergency  services  to  reach  the  facility  at  times  when  it  will  most  likely  be  needed. 

The  NRC  should  not  issue  an  early  site  permit  for  a  location  in  an  area  that  will  most  likely  flood 
and  be  inundated  by  sea  level  rise  in  the  foreseeable  future  as  is  the  case  at  this  location.

Comment:  The  existing  nuclear  complex  is  already  vulnerable  to  sea  level  rise  and  especially 
storm  surge.  The  complex  is  built  on  a  man-made  island  in  the  Delaware  River  and  issues 
during  storms  are  already  well  documented.  The  NRC's  used  1 .5  meters  maximum  sea  level 
rise  in  their  EIS  and  risk  projections.  While  1.5m  is  considered  by  scientists  to  be  a  reasonable 
level  of  increase  by  the  year  2100,  neither  the  NRC  nor  PSEG  have  given  any  indication  that

they  would  plan  to  decommission  the  existing  and/or  possible  new  reactor  by  that  time.  In  fact, 
given  the  extensive  life  of  a  nuclear  reactor  permit  (Salem  was  recently  permitted  for  another  60 
years)  and  the  extreme  difficulty  /  high  cost  associated  with  decommission  and  moving  decades 
of  lethal  nuclear  waste,  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  these  reactors  would  be  closed  or  the 
waste  moved  by  2100.  Therefore  only  projecting  sea  level  rise  out  to  that  level  is  shortsighted 
and  potentially  very  dangerous.  (0036-2  [Cornelia,  Jared])

and  potentially  very  dangerous.  (0041-1  [Erlich,  Marion]) 

Comment:  Also  needing  to  be  factored  in  are  rising  sea  levels.  Salem  is  along  the  Delaware 
River,  and  vulnerable  to  future  flooding  as  climate  change  raises  sea  levels.  (0044-4  [Slack, 
Gary]) 

Comment:  This  plant  is  already  subject  to  unstoppable  sea  level  rise  due  to  global  warming. 
The  area  is  prone  to  flooding  and  the  flooding  is  severe  during  storm  surges  and  hurricanes. 
(0045-2  [Durnan,  Alexander]) 

Comment:  And  rising  tides  and  storms  from  climate  change  pose  extreme  risk  which  we've 
already  witnessed.  This  will  not  change,  but  will  increase  for  years  as  systems  lose  stability. 
(0047-6  [Campion,  Mary]) 

Response:  The  issues  raised  in  these  comments  (including  sea-level  rise,  storm  surge,  and 
co-location  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  in  dose  proximity  to  existing  nuclear  reactor  units)  are  safety 
issues,  and  as  such,  are  outside  the  scope  of  this  environmental  review.  A  safety  assessment 
for  the  proposed  licensing  action  was  provided  by  PSEG  as  part  of  the  application  for  the  early

site  permit.  Separate  and  distinct  from  the  environmental  review  documented  in  this  EIS,  the 
NRC  is  developing  an  SER  that  will  analyze  all  aspects  of  reactor  and  operational  safety  related 
to  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these 
comments. 

Comment:  Third,  over  the  years  a  healthy  relationship  between  the  regulators  and  the  plant 
operator,  has  strengthened  the  safety  and  operation  of  the  facilities.  And  fourth,  the 
development  of  a  safety  culture,  over  the  years,  that  has  been  anchored  by  results  oriented  and 
effective  corrective  action  program.  (0004-13-3  [Miller,  Lynn]) 

Comment:  Now  that  I  have  worked,  at  Salem,  for  almost  two  years  I  have  noticed  some  of  the 
subtle  changes  my  new  job  is  having  on  me.  We  take  safety  to  a  level  I  wouldn't  have  thought 
existed  before  I  started  this  job.  Even  off  the  clock  I  find  myself  practicing  the  habits  that  we 
discuss,  every  morning,  at  work.  (0006-10-1  [Barch,  Alexander]) 

Comment:  I  am  concerned,  very  much,  about  the  history  and  the  safety  issues  of  this  plant. 

We  recently  had  some  issues  with  some  bolts  and  water  pumps,  and  other  things  that  give  us 
some  serious  concerns.  And  before  we  spend,  I'm  not  yet  convinced  that  those  have  been 
properly  evaluated.  (0007-2-15  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  I  have  been  to  the  plant,  over  there,  many  times  with  them.  I  have  taken  tours,  I 
know  what  it  is.  They  have  a  terrible  operational  record.  The  NRC  has  fined  them  millions  of 
dollars,  over  the  last  20  years,  from  security  to  the  breaches  that  have  happened  there,  in  the 
operations  of  it.  So  you  are  not  pulling  anything,  any  wool  on  the  eyes  over  here.  (0007-3-17 
[August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  Now,  we  are  talking  about  baseload.  Nuclear  power  plants  have  to  have  a  constant 
supply  of  electricity.  And  when  the  electricity  goes  out  they  have  backup  generators.  These 
have  to  be  constantly  tested.  And  they  have  to  at  least  operate  for  eight  hours  to  get  the  plant 
to  a  point  of  safety  in  a  hot  shutdown,  in  a  cool  shutdown.  (0007-3-3  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  Now,  during  hurricane  Sandy,  or  superstorm  Sandy,  we  had  a  storm  surge  that 
came  up  this  Delaware  River,  and  knocked  out  five  of  the  six  cooling  pumps  going  into  Salem. 
And,  also,  we  were  lucky  that  Tom's  River  Site,  which  is  a  Fukushima  GE  Mark  1  plant,  was  off¬ 
line,  and  they  were  refueling  it.  But  they  lost  electricity,  and  they  had  to  bring  generators  in  to 
circulate,  and  put  fire  trucks  for  about  three  or  four  days,  to  circulate  the  storage  pools.  (0007-3- 
4  [August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  And,  just  finally,  I  would  like  to  also  point  out  Salem  Hope  Creek's  complexes 
troubled  past.  They  repeatedly  had  incidents.  You  don't  have  to  be  an  expert,  you  can  read 
about  them  in  the  paper,  all  the  time.  They  had  the  missing  bolts,  they  didn't  even  realize  how 
long  the  bolts  were  missing  until  they  went  down,  just  incidentally,  for  refueling.  What  kind  of 
emergencies  could  have  happened?  Who  knows.  In  that  time,  thankfully,  they  didn't.  (0007-5-10 
[Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  And  I  would  like  to  point  out  Salem's  troubled  past.  I  appreciate  all  the  folks  who 
work  there  who,  I'm  sure,  are  very  responsible.  But  this  is  a  facility  that  has  repeatedly  had 
incidents,  as  recently,  major  incidents,  as  recently  as  May  of  this  year.  At  least  15  bolts,  at  least 


November  2015 


E-235 


NUREG-2168 


Appendix  E 


15  broken  bolts  were  found  in  this  facility,  during  a  routine  fuel  change.  And  I'm  not  exactly  sure 
how  long  those  bolts  were  broken.  I  don't  think  anyone  is  sure  of  that.  But  I  do  know,  from  what 
I  read  in  the  paper,  that  they've  known  that  since  at  least  the  mid-1990s  that  those  bolts  could 
present  a  problem.  And  that,  obviously,  wasn't  addressed  since  they  were  still  in  there,  in  2004. 
So  I'm  concerned  that  if  this  facility  has  such  great  safety  record,  things  like  that  continue  to 
happen.  Adding  another  doesn't  necessarily  seem  like  the  most  wise,  until  we  get  the  current 
problems,  like  that,  straightened  out.  (0008-4-10  [Herron,  Stephanie]) 

Comment:  Salem  nuclear  was  recently  ranked  the  worst  nuclear  site  in  the  country.  On  May 
7th  of  this  year  one  of  the  Salem  plants  tripped  for  the  3rd  time  in  30  days,  a  sign  of  poor 
reliability,  and  poor  operation.  The  NRC  is  supposed  to  shut  them  down  after  3  trips  and 
investigate  all  problems.  The  history  of  this  plant  should  not  warrant  another  chance.  (001 1  -3 
[Keating,  Thomas]) 

Comment:  There  are  three  main  concerns  that  I  have  about  your  proposal.  They  are  waste 
disposal;  fish  and  marine  creatures  kills;  and  safety  ....  As  to  safety,  the  bolts  breaking  do  not 
increase  confidence  in  the  structural  soundness  of  nuclear  power  plants.  (0019-5  [Passmore, 
Wills]) 

Comment:  I  recently  read  of  the  bolts  shearing  off  the  fan  blades  in  a  back-up  cooling  unit  at 
Salem.  Wrong  bolts  used  in  spite  of  manufacturer's  warning.  Bolts  on  the  fan  blades  in  a 
cooling  unit  in  a  nuclear  reactor!  The  operator's  response  to  the  public  was  "that  is  never  posed" 
a  problem.  That's  all  the  explanation  you  get.  Once  can  only  ask  "What  kind  of  fools  do  they 
take  us  for?"  The  answer  is  "First  Class."  (0046-4  [Campion,  George]) 

Response:  The  items  discussed  in  these  comments  relate  to  the  operational  safety  of  the 
existing  SGS  and/or  the  existing  HCGS.  The  issues  raised  in  the  comments  are  outside  the 
scope  of  the  environmental  review,  and  will  not  be  addressed  in  the  EIS.  That  said,  the 
following  are  examples  of  how  NRC  addresses  operational  safety  issues  at  existing  nuclear 
power  plants.  NRC  maintains  resident  inspectors  at  each  reactor  site.  These  inspectors 
monitor  the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  plant  and  perform  inspections  to  ensure  compliance 
with  NRC  requirements.  In  addition,  the  NRC  has  an  operational  experience  program  that 
ensures  that  safety  issues  that  are  found  at  one  plant  are  properly  addressed  at  the  others,  as 
appropriate.  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  And,  as  we  learned  in  Japan,  recently,  we  need  to  be  aware  of  this.  We  may,  like 
Japan,  think  that  we  are  not  vulnerable.  But  if  you  are  going  to  do  something  like  this  you  really 
do  need  to  address  the  serious,  serious  concerns.  (0007-2-8  [Carter,  David]) 

Comment:  Now,  all  of  the  knowledge  base,  on  lessons  learned,  from  Three  Mile  Island,  on 
operation  of  these  plants,  from  the  Fukushima  lessons  learned,  have  not  been  applied  to  any 
plant  in  this  country,  yet.  And  they  are  still  wanting  to  build  nuclear  power  plants.  (0007-3-5 
[August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  Two,  do  you  work  with  the  United  States,  USGS,  on  the  siting  of  these  plants,  and 
what  criteria  do  they  have  inputs  on,  on  the  siting  of  the  plant?  Because,  right  now,  Salem 
Nuclear  Power  Plant  is  sitting  on  what  is  called  the  Townsend  formation.  And  I  had  to  go  to 


NUREG-2168 


E-236

Appendix  E 


Denver,  Colorado,  to  the  USGS  map  service,  to  get  the  map.  It  is  sitting  on  900  feet  of  mud  with 
no  rock  bottom,  as  being  held  up  by  about  1 ,200  pilings  and  it  is  sinking.  So  the  idea  of  putting 
another  power  plant  out  there,  that  is  already  on  a  site  that  is  sinking,  is  ridiculous.  (0007-3-8 
[August,  Bernard]) 

Comment:  The  crucial  planning  will  come  not  with  the  Early  Site  Permit  but  with  the  actual 
details  of  the  plant  design.  My  questions  would  include:  concern  for  extreme  floods  and 
adequate  entrance  and  egress  systems,  maintaining  a  good,  continuous  dialog  with  the 
community  and  an  insistence  that  only  the  best  science  be  incorporated  in  planning  and 
construction.  (0009-8  [Locandro,  Roger]) 

Response:  The  items  discussed  in  these  comments  relate  to  the  operational  safety  of  a  new 
nuclear  plant  at  the  PS  EG  Site,  and  as  such,  are  outside  the  scope  of  this  environmental 
review.  A  safety  assessment  for  the  proposed  licensing  action  was  provided  by  PSEG  as  part 
of  the  application  for  the  early  site  permit.  Separate  and  distinct  from  the  environmental  review 
documented  in  this  EIS,  the  NRC  is  developing  an  SER  that  will  all  aspects  of  reactor  and 
operational  safety  related  to  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  No  changes  were  made  to 
the  EIS  as  a  result  of  these  comments. 

Comment:  NRC  should  therefore  withdraw  the  DEIS  since  PSEG  presently  does  not  have 
adequate  legal  authority  to  seek  this  ESP  approval  since  it  does  not  own  the  land  or  have  other 
legal  power  over  all  of  the  land  upon  which  this  nuclear  power  plant  is  proposed.  (0020-1-19  [van 
Rossum,  Maya]) 

Response:  The  NRC  is  addressing  this  issue  as  part  of  the  safety  review  of  the  ESP 
application  by  requiring  a  permit  condition  that  will  require  PSEG  to  obtain  legal  authority  from 
the  USACE  to  either  allow  PSEG  and  its  surrogates  to  determine  all  activities  including 
exclusion  or  removal  of  personnel  and  property  from  the  area  or  require  that  the  USACE 
exercise  control  in  a  specified  manner.  The  agreement  will  specify  that  no  residences  are 
allowed  within  the  exclusion  area.  Some  public  uses  of  the  land  may  be  allowed,  but  PSEG  will 
acquire  the  ability  to  remove  and  subsequently  exclude  people.  The  staff  finds  the  proposed 
permit  condition,  acceptable  because  they  ensure  that  PSEG  will  have  appropriate  authority  to 
determine  or  control  access  and  exclusion  to  areas  within  the  exclusion  area  boundary.  Prior  to 
issuance  of  a  COL,  PSEG,  or  other  COL  applicant  referencing  the  ESP,  shall  complete  the 
activities  called  for  in  the  permit  condition  and  submit  notification  of  their  completion  to  the  NRC 
for  staff  verification. 

E.2.44  Comments  Concerning  Issues  Outside  Scope  -  Security  and  Terrorism 

Comment:  Furthermore,  the  report  does  not  address  the  possibility  of  a  deliberately  caused 
event  designed  to  maximize  damage,  though  in  this  day  and  age  it  should.  It  only  considers  the 
likelihood  of  "accident"  events  that  are  due  to  natural,  design  or  human  error  causes.  It  tries  to 
mitigate  concerns  of  a  nuclear  catastrophe  by  pointing  to  the  recent  catastrophe  at  Fukushima 
and  "lessons  learned"  from  that  event.  (0012-6  [Magyar,  David]) 

Response:  Comments  related  to  security  and  terrorism  are  safety  issues  that  are  not  within  the 
scope  of  the  staff's  environmental  review.  The  NRC  is  devoting  substantial  time  and  attention  to 


November  2015 


E-237 


NUREG-2168 


Appendix  E 


terrorism-related  matters,  including  coordination  with  the  U.  S.  Department  of  Homeland 
Security.  As  part  of  its  mission  to  protect  public  health  and  safety  and  the  common  defense  and 
security  pursuant  to  the  Atomic  Energy  Act,  the  NRC  staff  is  conducting  vulnerability 
assessments  for  the  domestic  utilization  of  radioactive  material.  In  the  time  since  September 
2001,  the  NRC  has  identified  the  need  for  license  holders  to  implement  compensatory 
measures  and  has  issued  several  orders  to  license  holders  imposing  enhanced  security 
requirements.  Finally,  the  NRC  has  taken  actions  to  ensure  that  applicants  and  license  holders 
maintain  vigilance  and  a  high  degree  of  security  awareness.  Consequently,  the  NRC  will 
continue  to  consider  measures  to  prevent  and  mitigate  the  consequences  of  acts  of  terrorism  in 
fulfilling  its  safety  mission.  There  are  requirements  for  the  physical  protection  of  spent  nuclear 
fuel  in  transit  as  set  forth  in  10  CFR  73.  Recent  proposed  revisions  to  10  CFR  73  would  provide 
additional  security  enhancements  in  several  areas  including  communications,  procedures  and 
training,  armed  escorts,  and  deadly  force.  Additional  information  about  the  NRC  staff's  actions 
regarding  physical  security  since  September  1 1,  2001,  can  be  found  on  the  NRC's  website 
(http://www.nrc.gov).  No  changes  were  made  to  the  EIS  as  a  result  of  this  comment. 

E.2.45  General  Editorial  Comments 

Numerous  comments  (not  listed  here)  were  received  on  the  draft  EIS  identifying  general

Summary:  This  new  SHPO  Opinion  finds  the  John  Maddox  Dcnn  House  and  the  Sara 
Mason  House  are  eligible  for  inclusion  on  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  under 
Criterion  C  for  18th  century  pattern-brick  architecture.  While  the  process  to  identify  all  historic 
properties  and  affects  assessment  has  not  yet  been  completed,  construction  of  the  new,  larger 
cooling  towers  will  adversely  affect  the  viewshed  of  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House 
National  Historic  Landmark.

HPO  Project  No.  09-0740-20 
HPO-L20 1 4-080  PROD 

I'hank  you  for  identifying  the  area  of  potential  effects  (APE)  for  the  cooperating  agencies; 
specifically  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  responsibilities  for  Artificial  Island 
(physical  and  visual  impacts)  and  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  responsible  for 
dredging  and  the  Money  Island  Access  Road  APE. 

The  HPO  concurs  with  the  NRC's  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  an  Early  Site  Permit 
(ESP)  at  the  PSEC  Site  (EIS)  that  the  Phase  II  archaeological  survey  for  the  barge  facility  and 
water  intake  area  has  been  completed  with  a  finding  of  no  historic  properties  affected. 

The  HPO  agrees  Phase  I  archaeological  survey  for  Money  Island  access  road  identified 
archaeological  sites  28-Sa-179,  28-Sa-180,  28-Sa-182.  and  28-Sa-186.  Phase  II  archaeological 
survey  will  be  completed  during  the  Combined  Construction  and  Operating  License  Application 
(COLA)  as  needed  depending  on  the  final  APE.  The  visual  impact  of  the  proposed  Money 
Island  access  road  is  on-going. 

The  HPO  looks  forward  to  reviewing  the  NRC’s  assessment  and  analysis  by  a  gcomorphologist 
that  the  soil  boring  program  for  Artificial  Island  determined  no  presence  exists  for  prehistoric 
soils  below  the  former  river  bed  encapsulated  below  Artificial  Island.- 

Based  upon  AK.RF's  April  20,  2012  addendum  historic  properties  visual  impact  assessment 
report,  as  the  Deputy  State  Historic  Preservation  Officer  for  New  Jersey,  I  find  the  following 
properties  eligible  for  listing  on  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  under  Criterion  C  for 
1 8th  century  pattern-brick  architecture; 

1 .  John  Maddox  Dcnn  House  (1 12  Popular  Street,  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township) 

2.  Sarah  Mason  House  (349  Fort  Elfsborg  Road,  Elsinboro  Township) 

In  consequence,  this  is  a  new  SHPO  opinion  of  eligibility. 

800.5  Assess  Adverse  Effects 

Through  earlier  consultation,  the  HPO  agreed  that  permitting  a  new  energy  station  through  the 
F.SP  process  would  not  be  have  the  potential  to  effect  historic  properties  and  that  HPO  comment 
on  visual  impacts  would  be  conducted  during  the  COLA  when  more  specific,  detailed 
construction  information  was  available.  A  review  of  the  EIS  suggests  HPO  has  failed  to  make 
this  point  clear  to  NRC  (EIS  Sections  2.7.1,  4.6,  and  7.5).  While  more  specific  HPO  comment 
on  visual  impacts  will  be  forthcoming  through  section  106  consultation  during  the  COLA,  the 
cumulative  effects  of  introducing  two  additional  cooling  towers,  76  feet  higher  than  the  existing, 
with  vapor  columns  will  adversely  affect  the  viewshed  of  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House 
National  Historic  Landmark. 

Additional  Comments 

Thank  you  again  for  providing  the  opportunity  to  review  and  comment  on  the  potential  for  the 
project  to  effect  historic  properties.  The  HPO  looks  forward  to  continued  consultation  to  identify- 
historic  properties,  assess  affects,  and  resolve  adverse  effects  on  historic  properties.  Please

Summary:  This  new  SHPO  Opinion  finds  that  the  Alloway  Creek  Rural  Historic  District  is 

eligible  for  listing  on  the  National  Registers  of  Historic  Places  under  Criteria  A,  B,  and  C  for  its 
association  with  the  early  settlement  and  continued,  unique  agricultural  history'  of  Salem  County, 
and  as  a  continuously  distinguishable  landscape,  with  few  modem  intrusions. 


800.4  Identification  of  Historic  Properties 

On  January  9,  2015,  HPO  staff  and  I  conducted  a  site  visit  along  with  the  United  States  Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission  (NRC);  United  States  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (IJSACE);  PSEG  (the 
Applicant);  AKRF;  and  Janet  Sheridan  (interested  consulting  party.)  Based  upon  this  site  visit 
and  subsequent  research,  it  is  my  opinion  that  the  Alloway  Creek  Rural  Historic  District  is 
eligible  for  listing  on  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places.

The  Alloway  Creek  Rural  Historic  District  is  characterized  by  a  concentration  of  1 8th  century 
brick  farmhouses,  several  of  which  display  patterned  brickwork.  Many  of  these  farmhouses 
remain  on  large  agricultural  parcels,  which  in  some  cases  may  approximate  the  historic 
boundaries  of  the  farm.  In  addition,  the  district  contains  several  early  wood-frame  houses,  and 
mid- 19th  century  Italianatc  farmhouses.  The  later  houses  demonstrate  the  continued  prosperity  of 
this  area  through  that  century'.  Due  to  the  lack  of  modem  intrusions,  the  district  retains  an 
extremely  high  level  of  integrity  and  ability'  to  convey  its  historic  association  with  farming  both 
the  uplands,  and  tidal  wetlands  reclaimed  through  diking,  known  as  banks. 

The  Alloway  Creek  Rural  Historic  District  represents  a  rare  surviving  example  of  an  1 8th  and 
19lh  century  agricultural  landscape  in  South  Jersey,  and  is  eligible  under  Criterion  A  for  iLs 
association  with  the  early  settlement  of  Salem  County  and  development  into  a  wealthy 
agricultural  center;  under  Criterion  R  as  the  settlement  of  many  of  Salem  County’s  earliest  and 
most  prominent  residents,  including  John  Mason,  Richard  Darkin,  Nathaniel  Chambless,  Abel 
Nicholson,  George  Abbott,  William  Hancock,  Isaac  Smart,  and  William  Waddington;  and 
Criterion  C  as  a  significant  and  distinguishable  entity  consisting  of  a  concentration  of  patterned 
brickwork  houses,  less  common  wood-frame  farmhouses,  and  farmhouses  that  were  altered  or 
newly  constructed  throughout  the  district’s  history  to  reflect  the  changing  tastes  and  continued 
agricultural  prosperity  of  Alloway  Creek. 

Among  the  properties  included  in,  and  contributing  to,  the  Alloway  Creek  Rural  Historic  District 
are: 

•  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House,  127  Fort  Elfsborg-  Hancock  Bridge  Road,  Elsinboro 
Township.  (Individually  listed  as  a  National  Historic  Landmark.) 

•  Darkin  House,  85  Amw'ellbury  Road,  Elsinboro  Township. 

•  Samuel  and  Sarah  Nicholson  House,  1 53  Amwellbury  Road,  Elsinboro  Township. 
(Individually  listed  on  the  New  Jersey  and  National  Registers  of  Historic  Places) 

•  Morris  Goodwin  House,  337  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road,  Elsinboro  Township, 
(this  HABS-documented  house  may  be  contributing  if  interior  fabric  remains  as  the 
exterior  has  been  heavily  altered) 

•  Sarah  Mason  House,  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road,  Elsinboro  Township. 
(SHPO  Opinion  12/4/2014) 

•  Colonel  Benjamin  Holme  House,  410  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road,  Elsinboro 
Township.  (Individually  listed  on  NJR  and  NRHP) 

•  John  Mason  1  louse,  63  Money  Island  Road,  Elsinboro  Township.  (SHPO  Opinion

•  Mason-Waddington  House,  130  Money  Island  Road,  Elsinboro  Township. 

•  116  Mason  Point  Road,  Elsinboro  Township. 

•  Isaac  Smart  House,  489  Salem-Fort  Elfsborg  Road.  Elsinboro  Township. 

•  Nathaniel  Chambless  House,  277  Alloway  Creek  Neck  Road,  Lower  Alloways  Creek

•  John  Maddox  Denn  House,  1 12  Poplar  Street,  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township.  (SHPO 
Opinion  12/4/2014) 

The  approximate  boundaries  (which  will  be  refined  upon  further  research)  of  the  Alloway  Creek 
Rural  Historic  District  are  the  Delaware  River  on  the  west  (exclusive  of  the  Oakwood  Beach 
area,  an  early  20^  century  riverfront  settlement);  Salem  Creek  on  the  north;  the  north  and  south 
forks  of  the  Alloway  Creek  on  the  east;  and  Hope  Creek  on  the  south.  These  boundaries  include 
land  within  Elsinboro  and  Alloways  Creek  Townships.  The  period  of  significance  for  the  district 
begins  with  first  generation  settlement  in  1695  (the  year  in  which  the  John  Mason  House  was 
constructed)  and  ends  in  1870,  marking  the  declining  prosperity  of  this  unique  rural  landscape. 

Thank  you  for  providing  the  opportunity  to  review  and  comment  on  the  potential  for  the 
above-referenced  project  to  affect  historic  properties.  Please  do  not  hesitate  to  contact  Michelle

SUBJECT:  NOTIFICATION  OF  POTENTIAL  ADVERSE  EFFECT  FROM  THE  PSEG  EARLY 

SITE  PERMIT  APPLICATION  REVIEW  IN  SALEM  COUNTY.  NEW  JERSEY 

Dear  Mr.  Nelson: 

The  U  S  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  is  reviewing  an  application  submitted  by 
PSEG  Power,  LLC  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  for  an  Early  Site  Permit  (ESP)  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  site,  which  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east 
bank  of  the  Delaware  River  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey 
The  proposed  site  is  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Nuclear 
Generating  Station.  Units  1  and  2  As  part  of  the  review  of  this  ESP  application  the  NRC  has 
prepared  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (EIS)  as  required  by  Title  10  of  the  Code  of 
Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  51,  the  NRC  regulations  that  implement  the  National 
Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  of  1969,  as  amended.  Your  office  was  contacted  by  the  NRC 
on  October  10,  2010,  informing  you  that  we  were  coordinating  our  National  Historic  Preservation 
Act  (NHPA)  Section  106  review  with  our  NEPA  review  for  this  application 

The  NRC's  efforts  to  address  its  Section  106  obligations  for  the  project  are  described  in  the  draft 
EIS,  which  was  released  in  August  2014  Briefly,  interactions  with  the  New  Jersey  Historic 
Preservation  Office  (NJ  HPO).  Salem  Historical  Society,  and  the  Salem  Old  House  foundation 
began  in  2009  when  the  NRC  became  aware  that  an  application  for  an  ESP  was  imminent 
Once  the  application  was  received,  several  architectural  studies  were  done  by  a  qualified 
contractor  on  behalf  of  the  applicant  to  identify  historic  properties  in  the  region  and  to  begin 
considenng  effects  from  the  project.  The  agreed  upon  visual  Area  of  Potential  Effect  (APE)  was 
identified  as  4.9  miles.  NRC  staff  later  met  with  NJ  HPO  staff  during  the  environmental  site 
audit  in  May  2012  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  draft  EIS  to  explain  the  proposed  project, 
request  information  on  any  interested  parties  and  to  inquire  if  there  were  any  issues  that  the 
NRC  needed  to  address  during  our  review  Findings  of  No  Adverse  Effect  from  the  project  were 
received  from  the  Delaware  and  NJ  HPOs  in  September  and  December  2013  respectively.  The 
draft  EIS  was  released  to  the  public  in  August  2014,  and  contained  an  agency  determination  of 
No  Adverse  Effect  to  historic  properties  The  draft  EIS  contains  a  description  of  the  information 
required  in  36  CFR  800.1 1(e)(1)-(4)  (see  Chapters  2,  4,  5,  and  Appendices  C  and  F)  and  is 
accessible  online  at  http://www.nrc.qov/readinq-rm/adams.html. 

Based  on  a  revised  opinion  letter  from  the  NJ  HPO  dated  December  4  2014,  indicating,  in  the 
NJ  HPO's  opinion,  that  the  construction  of  two  new  natural  draft  cooling  towers  would  visually 
affect  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  National  Historic  Landmark  (NHL),  the  NRC  revisited  its 
effects  determination  for  the  project  (Enclosure  1).  Four  meetings  were  held  with  the  NJ  HPO  to 


November  2015 


F-15

R  Nelson  -  2  - 

discuss  the  effects  and  possible  strategies  for  mitigating  any  effects  resulting  from  the  project 
(January  9,  2015,  in  Salem  County;  February  12,  2015,  at  NJ  HPO  offices,  April  23,  2015,  at  NJ 
HPO  offices,  and  May  19,  2015,  in  Salem  County).  In  attendance  at  some  of  these  meetings 
were  representatives  from  the  Advisory  Council  on  Historic  Preservation  (ACHP),  the  National 
Park  Service,  PSEG  as  well  as  interested  stakeholders.  PSEG  also  had  its  contractor,  AKRF, 
do  additional  research  on  the  potential  for  visual  effects  on  historic  resources  found  in  the  region 
from  the  project.  With  this  letter,  in  accordance  with  36  CFR  800  6(a)(1),  the  NRC  is  notifying 
the  ACHP  of  an  indirect  adverse  (i.e. ,  visual)  effect  to  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  (127 
Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road),  349  Fort  Elfsborg- Hancock  Bridge  Road,  and  116  Mason 
Point  Drive,  in  the  event  that  natural  draft  cooling  towers  were  constructed  at  the  proposed 
project  site.  The  indirect  adverse  effect  would  be  cumulative  because  the  current  setting 
already  contains  a  natural  draft  cooling  tower  immediately  south  of  the  project  site  The  indirect 
adverse  effects  would  only  occur  if  natural  draft  cooling  towers  were  chosen  as  the  cooling 
system  for  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  proposed  site  location  (the  applicant  is  not  obligated  to 
choose  its  cooling  system  at  the  ESP  stage)  Mechanical  draft  cooling  towers  would  have  no 
effect  on  these  properties. 

The  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  is  a  patterned  brick  house  that  is  both  listed  on  the  New 
Jersey  and  National  Registers  and  is  a  NHL.  The  house  at  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge 
Road  is  an  18th  century  pattern  brick  house  that  was  extensively  remodeled  during  the  third 
quarter  of  the  nineteenth  century  in  the  Italianate  style  The  house  at  1 16  Mason  Point  Road  is 
a  two-story  timber-framed  house  built  in  the  style  of  the  18th  century  vernacular  architecture  of 
the  region.  Both  houses  are  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  (NRHP)-eligible  structures 
The  NJ  HPO  has  also  proposed,  in  a  letter  dated  April  13,  2015,  that  these  properties  should 
also  be  considered  as  contributing  to  an  Alloway  Creek  Rural  Historic  District  (Enclosure  2).  All 
affected  structures  are  within  the  agreed  upon  visual  area  of  potential  effect  of  4  9  miles  from 
the  proposed  project. 

An  ESP  resolves  issues  involving  site  safety,  environmental  characteristics,  and  emergency 
preparedness  that  are  independent  of  a  specific  nuclear  reactor  design.  This  permitting 
approach  provides  an  applicant  with  an  opportunity  to  "bank”  a  site  for  up  to  20  years,  reduces 
licensing  uncertainty,  and  resolves  siting  issues  before  construction.  The  ESP  does  not  license 
a  nuclear  power  plant  to  be  built.  If  the  applicant  decides  to  build  and  operate  a  nuclear  power 
plant,  then  it  has  to  apply  for  a  combined  license  (COL).  The  NRC  will  issue  a  supplemental 
EIS  and  perform  Section  106  consultation  for  the  COL  undertaking  if  and  when  an  application  is 
received  For  the  supplemental  EIS,  if  there  is  no  new  and  significant  information,  then  the  NRC 
relies  on  the  final  EIS  issued  for  the  ESP  For  the  COL  Section  106  review,  the  NRC  would  rely 
on  the  consultation  performed  at  the  ESP  stage  to  inform  the  required  consultation  at  the  COL 
stage. 

For  your  reference,  this  letter  includes  detailed  background  (see  enclosures)  on  the  NRC’s 
activities  pursuant  to  Section  106  of  the  NHPA  to  date  Concerns  raised  by  the  consulting 
parties  primarily  relate  to  the  visual  effects  from  two  natural  draft  cooling  towers  on  the  cultural 
setting  Because  of  these  concerns  for  the  cultural  setting,  possible  mitigation  would  likely  not 
include  visual  screening.  A  draft  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  is  currently  under 
development  between  NRC,  interested  parties,  NJ  HPO,  PSEG,  and  potentially  the  National 
Park  Service  and  your  office.  Once  a  finalized  draft  is  developed,  it  will  be  forwarded  to  your 
office  for  review  and  comment.  In  addition,  the  NRC  invites  your  agency  to  be  a  signatory  to  the 
MOA.  The  NRC  staff  requests  that  you  indicate  your  interest  in  participating  within  15  days  of

SUBJECT:  NOTIFICATION  OF  POTENTIAL  ADVERSE  EFFECT  FROM  THE  PSEG  EARLY 

SITE  PERMIT  APPLICATION  REVIEW  IN  SALEM  COUNTY,  NEW  JERSEY 

Dear  Mr.  Saunders: 

The  U  S  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  is  reviewing  an  application  submitted  by 
PSEG  Power,  LLC  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  for  an  Early  Site  Permit  (ESP)  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  site,  which  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east 
bank  of  the  Delaware  River  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey. 

The  proposed  site  is  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Nuclear 
Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2.  As  part  of  the  review  of  this  ESP  application,  the  NRC  is 
prepanng  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (EIS)  as  required  by  Title  10  of  the  Code  of 
Federal  Regulations  (10  CFR)  Part  51,  the  NRC  regulations  that  implement  the  National 
Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  of  1969,  as  amended  Your  office  was  contacted  by  the  NRC 
on  October  26,  2010,  informing  you  that  we  were  coordinating  our  Section  106  review  with 
NEPA  for  this  review.  The  draft  EIS  was  issued  for  public  comment  in  August  2014  and 
contained  an  agency  determination  of  No  Adverse  Effect  to  historic  properties. 

Based  on  a  revised  opinion  letter  from  your  office  dated  December  4,  2014,  indicating  that  the 
construction  of  two  new  natural  draft  cooling  towers  would  visually  affect  the  Abel  and  Mary 
Nicholson  National  Historic  Landmark,  the  NRC  revisited  its  effects  determination  for  the 
proposed  project  Four  meetings  were  held  with  your  office  to  discuss  the  effects  and  possible 
strategies  for  mitigating  any  effects  resulting  from  the  project  (January  9,  2015,  in  Salem 
County;  February  12,  2015,  at  NJ  HPO  offices,  April  23,  2015,  at  NJ  HPO  offices,  and  May  19. 
2015,  in  Salem  County).  In  attendance  at  some  of  these  meetings  were  the  Advisory  Council 
on  Historic  Preservation,  the  National  Park  Service,  PSEG  and  interested  stakeholders.  PSEG 
also  had  its  contractor  AKRF  do  additional  research  on  the  potential  for  visual  effects  on  historic 
resources  found  in  the  region  from  the  project.  Based  on  these  discussions  and  the  additional 
research  done,  the  NRC  is  notifying  your  office  of  its  determination  that  the  project  would  have 
an  indirect  adverse  (i.e.,  visual)  effect  to  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  (127  Fort  Elfsborg- 
Hancock  Bridge  Road),  349  Fort  Elfsborg- Hancock  Bridge  Road,  and  116  Mason  Point  Road,  in 
the  event  that  natural  draft  cooling  towers  were  constructed  at  the  proposed  project  site.  The 
indirect  adverse  effect  would  be  cumulative  because  the  current  setting  already  contains  a 
natural  draft  cooling  tower  immediately  south  of  the  proposed  project  site.  The  indirect  adverse 
effect  would  only  occur  if  natural  draft  cooling  towers  were  chosen  as  the  cooling  system  for  a 
new  nuclear  plant  at  the  proposed  site  location  (the  applicant  is  not  obligated  to  choose  its 
cooling  system  at  the  ESP  stage).  Mechanical  draft  cooling  towers  would  have  no  effect  on

349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock's  Bridge  Road  and  116  Mason  Point  Road  are  National  Register  of 
Histone  Places,  eligible  structures  Your  office  has  also  proposed,  in  a  letter  dated  Apnl  13,

SUBJECT  NOTIFICATION  OF  POTENTIAL  ADVERSE  EFFECT  TO  A  NATIONAL 
HISTORIC  LANDMARK  FROM  THE  PSEG  EARLY  SITE  PERMIT 
APPLICATION  REVIEW  IN  SALEM  COUNTY,  NEW  JERSEY 

Dear  Secretary  Jewell 

The  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  is  reviewing  an  application  submitted  by 
PSEG  Power,  LLC  and  PSEG  Nuclear.  LLC  (PSEG)  for  an  Early  Site  Permit  (ESP)  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  site,  which  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  on  the  east 
bank  of  the  Delaware  River  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey. 

The  proposed  site  is  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Nuclear 
Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2.  As  part  of  the  review  of  this  ESP  application,  the  NRC  is 
preparing  an  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  as  required  by  Title  10  of  the  Code  of 
Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  51,  the  NRC  regulations  that  implement  the  National 
Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  of  1969,  as  amended.  We  are  contacting  your  office  and 
inviting  your  participation  in  the  project  as  required  under  36  CFR  800.10(c)  when  there  is  an 
adverse  effect  to  a  National  Historic  Landmark  resulting  from  an  undertaking 

The  draft  EIS,  which  was  released  to  the  public  in  August  2014,  contained  an  agency 
determination  of  No  Adverse  Effect  to  historic  properties.  The  draft  EIS  is  accessible  online  at 
http://www  nrc  qov/readinq-rm/adams  html  Based  on  a  revised  New  Jersey  Historic 
Preservation  Office  (NJ  HPO)  opinion  on  the  undertaking  received  during  the  comment  period 
for  the  draft  EIS,  additional  research  was  undertaken.  Four  meetings  were  held  with  the  NJ 
HPO  to  discuss  the  effects  and  possible  strategies  for  mitigating  any  effects  resulting  from  the 
project  (January  9,  2015,  in  Salem  County;  February  12,  2015,  at  NJ  HPO  offices,  April  23, 

2015,  at  NJ  HPO  offices,  and  May  19.  2015,  in  Salem  County).  In  attendance  at  some  of  these 
meetings  were  the  Advisory  Council  on  Historic  Preservation,  the  National  Park  Service,  PSEG 
and  interested  stakeholders.  PSEG  also  had  its  contractor,  AKRF,  do  additional  research  on 
the  potential  for  visual  effects  on  historic  resources  found  in  the  region  from  the  project  The 
NRC  has  now  concluded  that  an  indirect  visual  effect  on  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House 
(Nicholson  House),  which  was  nominated  as  a  National  Historic  Landmark  in  2003,  would  result 
if  a  new  plant  using  natural  draft  cooling  was  built  on  Artificial  Island  The  Nicholson  House, 
constructed  in  1722,  is  4.9  miles  from  the  project  location  and  is  partially  screened  by 
vegetation,  therefore,  the  effect  to  the  property  is  deemed  to  be  indirect  The  effect  on  the 
Nicholson  House  would  be  cumulative  as  the  setting  for  the  Nicholson  House  already  contains 
the  natural  draft  cooling  tower  from  the  existing  plant.  The  effect  would  only  occur  if  the 
applicant  ultimately  puts  forth  an  application  that  includes  this  cooling  system  configuration. 

The  applicant  could  seek  to  use  a  mechanical  draft  cooling  system  option,  which  would  not

visually  affect  any  historic  properties.  An  ESP  does  not  approve  construction  nor  is  the 
applicant  obligated  to  use  the  technologies  analyzed  at  the  ESP  stage 

An  ESP  resolves  issues  involving  site  safety  environmental  characteristics  and  emergency

plant,  then  it  has  to  apply  for  a  combined  license  The  NRC  will  issue  a  supplemental  EIS  and 
perform  Section  106  consultation  for  the  combined  license  (COL)  undertaking  if  and  when  an 
application  is  received  For  the  supplemental  EIS,  if  there  is  no  new  and  significant  information, 
then  the  NRC  relies  on  the  final  EIS  issued  for  the  ESP  For  the  COL  Section  106  review,  the

developed  a  summary  of  comments  highlighting  the  major  issues  that  the  U.S.  Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  will  need  to  consider  as  it  drafts  the  next  version  of  the  Section 
106  agreement  document.  Our  comments  should  be  considered  along  with  those  submitted  by 
other  consulting  parties  who  arc  participating  in  the  Section  106  consultation  process. 

The  ACHP  recommended  that  NRC  develop  a  Programmatic  Agreement  (PA)  due  to  the 
complexity  of  the  project  and  the  fact  that  the  resolution  of  adverse  effects  remains  undetermined. 
At  the  time  of  development  of  this  agreement,  it  remained  uncertain  if  mechanical  or  natural  draft 
cooling  towers  would  be  selected  due  to  the  nature  of  the  Early  Site  Permit  (ESP)  permitting 
process.  Since  NRC  remains  uncertain  which  type  of  cooling  towers  will  be  selected,  a 
subsequent  106  consultation  may  be  required  before  the  issuance  of  the  Combined  License  (COL) 
if  the  natural  draft  cooling  lower  is  selected.  Therefore,  the  ACIIP  recommends  developing  a 
project  specific  PA  in  accordance  with  Section  800.14(b)  of  our  regulations,  "Protection  of 
Historic  Properties."  Wc  have  previously  shared  this  recommendation  with  NRC  and  believe  tiiis 
is  the  appropriate  manner  to  conclude  this  Section  106  review.  While  the  federal  agency  makes 
the  decision  about  the  type  of  agreement  document  that  it  decides  to  develop,  it  must  be 
consistent  with  our  practices  and  policies  in  order  for  us  to  be  a  signatory.  The  current  draft 
agreement  commits  to  preparing  two  MOAs:  one  for  the  F.SP  and  a  second  for  the  COL.  A  PA 
would  cover  both  these  related  federal  actions  under  the  jurisdiction  of  NRC.  This  type  of 
agreement  document  would  also  allow  NRC  to  develop  the  COL  agreement  as  an  amendment  to 
the  PA,  if  and  when  this  federal  action  is  implemented.

Specific  Comments 
Whereas  Section 

Scope  of  the  undertaking 

NRC  should  consider  including  language  explaining  the  entire  scope  of  the  undertaking, 
including  the  construction  of  the  causeway.  This  additional  language  should  include  the  total 
acreage  of  the  project.  The  Draft  1  Environmental  Impact  Statement  (DEIS)  can  be  cross- 
referenced  in  order  to  provide  this  additional  information.  In  particular,  NRC  could  tie  the 
description  of  the  undertaking  in  this  agreement  to  the  Proposed  Federal  Action  (Section  1.2)  and 
Purpose  and  Need  for  the  Proposed  Actions  (Section  1 .3)  sections  in  the  DEIS.  Please  refer  to  36 
C.F.R.  §  800.3  (a)  and  36  C.F.R.  §  800.16(y)  for  the  definition  of  an  undertaking. 

U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers 

NRC  should  consider  including  language  in  the  Whereas  Clause  that  clarifies  that  the  U.S.  Army 
Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  has  a  regulatory  action  to  complete  for  this  undertaking.  Further, 
per  our  discussion  with  the  Philadelphia  District,  USACE  acknowledges  its  responsibility  to 
comply  with  Section  106,  and  complete  the  Section  106  consultation  prior  to  the  issuance  of  the 
Department  of  the  Army  permit.  The  USACE  explained  to  us  that  it  still  has  additional  reviews  to 
complete.  Therefore,  USACE  is  not  prepared  to  be  a  signatory  to  NRC’s  agreement. 

Area  of  Potential  Effects 

NRC  should  consider  including  a  description  of  the  area  of  potential  effects  (APE)  that  clarifies 
that  it  covers  direct  and  indirect  effects.  The  DEIS  can  be  cross-referenced  for  this  additional 
information,  including  the  Historic  and  Cultural  Resources  Section  under  the  Affected 
Environment  Chapter  (Section  2.7  and  Section  2.7.2).  Please  refer  to  36  C.F.R.  §  800.4(a)(1)  and 
36  C.F.R.  §  800.16(d)  for  the  definition  of  APE. 

Identification  of  historic  properties 

NRC  should  consider  including  more  information  detailing  the  historic  properties  identified  in  the 
APE.  A  list  of  properties  can  be  provided  in  an  appendix  or  by  cross-referencing  the  DEIS  table 
listing  the  historic  properties  identified  in  the  APE  (Table  2-37,  page  2-167).  Please  refer  to  36 
C.F.R.  §  800.5. 

National  Historic  Landmark 

NRC  should  include  language  referencing  36  C.F.R.  §  800.10  in  its  entirety.  In  addition, 
reference  should  be  made  to  Section  1 1 0(0,  which  is  a  statutory  requirement  for  effects  to 
National  Historic  Landmarks  (NHI.s). 

Delaware  State  Historic  Preservation  Office 

NRC  should  include  a  Whereas  Clause  staling  that  the  Section  106  consultation  was  conducted 
with  the  Delaware  State  Historic  Preservation  Office  (SI  IPO)  and  that  the  Delaware  S11PO 
concurred  with  the  No  Adverse  Effect  (NAE)  finding.  The  DEIS  can  be  cross-referenced 
summarizing  the  NRC.  Section  106  consultation  with  the  Delaware  SI  IPO  (Section  2.7.3). 

Adverse  effects 

NRC  should  consider  including  a  more  detailed  description  of  indirect  and  cumulative  adverse 
effects.  Please  refer  to  36  C.F.R.  §  800.5.

Public  involvement 

NRC  should  clarify  how  it  plans  to  involve  the  public  in  the  drafting  of  the  MOA.  It  should  be 
clear  how  long  the  public  will  have  for  review,  i.e.  30  calendar  davs.  Please  refer  to  36  C.F.R.  § 
800.6(a)(4). 

General  Comments 

Overall,  there  are  an  excessive  number  of  Whereas  clauses  that  arc  not  critical  to  understanding 
how  NRC  has  completed  the  4-step  Section  106  process.  Since  these  clauses  are  not  critical  to 
understanding  the  who.  what,  and  why  as  outlined  in  the  ACHP’s  Guidance  on  Agreement 
Documents,  perhaps  they  can  be  deleted.

FINAL  MEMORANDUM  OF  AGREEMENT 

AMONG  THE  U.S  NUCLEAR  REGULATORY  COMMISSION,  NEW  JERSEY  HISTORIC 
PRESERVATION  OFFICE,  ADVISORY  COUNCIL  ON  HISTORIC  PRESERVATION,  AND 
PSEG  POWER,  LLC,  PSEG  NUCLEAR,  LLC  REGARDING  THE  PSEG  EARLY  SITE  PERMIT 

APPLICATION  FOR  A  SITE  LOCATED  IN  LOWER  ALLOWAYS  CREEK  TOWNSHIP, 

SALEM  COUNTY,  NEW  JERSEY 

WHEREAS,  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  has  determined  that  the  issuance 
of  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  to  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (hereafter  referred  to  as 
PSEG)  for  the  PSEG  ESP  site  located  on  Artificial  Island  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  would 
be  a  Federal  undertaking  for  purposes  of  NRC’s  compliance  with  Section  106  of  the  National 
Historic  Preservation  Act  of  1966,  as  amended  (NHPA,  54  U.S.C.  300101  et.  seq).  Pursuant  to 
Title  36  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR),  Section  800.8,  the  NRC  is  using  its  National 
Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  process  for  developing  the  ESP  environmental  impact 
statement  (EIS)  to  facilitate  compliance  with  Section  106  of  the  NHPA;  and 

WHEREAS,  an  ESP  is  a  licensing  option  provided  under  the  NRC’s  regulations  in  10  CFR  Part 
52  that  allows  an  applicant  to  obtain  approval  for  a  reactor  site.  The  approval  of  the  ESP 
indicates  that  there  are  no  environmental  issues  at  the  proposed  site  that  would  preclude  the 
construction  of  a  nuclear  power  plant  with  the  characteristics  identified  in  the  Plant  Parameter 
Envelope  (PPE).  Because  an  ESP  is  only  a  site  approval  and  does  not  authorize  the 
construction  or  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant,  an  applicant  may  obtain  an  ESP  without 
specifying  the  design  of  the  reactor(s)  that  it  may  separately  apply  to  build  and  operate  at  the 
site.  The  ESP  application  and  review  process  makes  it  possible  to  evaluate  and  resolve  safety 
and  environmental  issues  related  to  siting  before  the  applicant  makes  a  large  commitment  of 
resources.  Granting  an  ESP  would  result  in  no  effects  to  historic  properties;  the  ESP  EIS 
review  NEPA  includes  analysis  of  any  potential  adverse  effect  from  construction  and  operation 
of  a  postulated  plant  to  support  a  site  suitability  determination.  An  ESP  holder  would  be 
required  to  apply  for  and  obtain  a  combined  license  (COL)  or  a  construction  permit  and 
operating  license  (CP  and  OL),  which  would  be  another  Federal  undertaking,  before  it  could 
construct  and  operate  a  nuclear  power  plant.  An  NHPA  Section  106  consultation  would  be 
performed  if  and  when  a  COL  or  CP/OL  application  is  submitted;  and 

WHEREAS,  the  proposed  site  analyzed  in  the  ESP  EIS  is  an  819  acre  area  on  Artificial  Island 
where  the  postulated  plant  could  be  built.  The  tallest  structure  that  PSEG  included  in  its  PPE, 
allowing  for  a  bounding  visual  impacts  analysis  for  the  ESP  EIS,  is  two  590  foot  tall  natural  draft 
cooling  towers.  In  addition  to  analyzing  impacts  from  the  construction  and  operation  of  a 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  ESP  site,  the  ESP  EIS  also  analyzes  site  preparation  activities 
regulated  by  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE),  including  potential  dredging  and/or 
filling  activities  and  building  a  new  access  road  and  causeway  to  the  site  (See  ESP  EIS  Section 
1 .2);  and 

WHEREAS,  pursuant  to  NEPA,  the  USACE  is  a  cooperating  agency  with  the  NRC  on  the 
development  of  the  ESP  EIS,  but  is  not  a  signatory  to  this  agreement.  The  purpose  of  the 
USACE  action,  which  is  analyzed  in  the  ESP  EIS,  is  to  provide  a  decision  on  a  Department  of 
the  Army  permit  application  submitted  by  PSEG  to  perform  work,  build  structures,  and  discharge 
dredged  and/or  fill  material  in  jurisdictional  waters  of  the  United  States,  including  wetlands. 

MOA  among  the  NRC,  NJ  HPO,  ACHP,  and  PSEG  regarding  the  PSEG  ESP  Application 
for  a  site  Located  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey

Appendix  F 


Activities  requiring  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit,  including  building  a  causeway  from  Money 
Island  Road  to  the  PSEG  Site  and  potential  dredge  areas,  would  support  the  development  of  a 
new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  site;  and 

WHEREAS,  the  NRC  and  the  USACE  each  have  their  own  areas  of  regulatory  responsibility 
and  are  consulting  on  the  areas  of  the  project  that  are  within  their  regulatory  authority.  Because 
of  the  limited  regulatory  authority  of  each  agency,  neither  agency  can  consult  on  the  entire 
project.  The  NRC  is  consulting  on  the  impact  (including  visual  impacts)  of  construction  and 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  with  design  parameters  falling  within  the  PPE  on 
Artificial  Island.  The  USACE  is  consulting  separately  on  the  activities  described  above  that 
would  be  performed  under  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit  that  would  impact  jurisdictional 
waters,  including  wetlands,  per  33  CFR  325;  and 

WHEREAS,  PSEG  included  the  option  of  two  natural  draft  cooling  towers  (590  feet  tall)  in  the 
PPE  for  the  ESP  EIS  (NUREG-21 68)  analysis.  These  were  the  tallest  proposed  structures 
analyzed  for  the  bounding  visual  impact  analysis  for  the  ESP  EIS.  The  ESP  would  not  mandate 
the  use  of  natural  draft  cooling  towers  in  a  subsequent  application  to  construct  and  operate  a 
plant.  Natural  draft  cooling  is  one  of  two  cooling  system  options  analyzed  in  the  ESP  EIS;  and 

WHEREAS,  the  NRC  has  established  that  the  direct  area  of  potential  effect  (APE)  for  the  ESP 
EIS  is  the  area  at  the  PSEG  ESP  Site  and  its  immediate  environs  that  may  be  impacted  by  the 
land-disturbing  activities  associated  with  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  unit  or 
units,  and  the  NRC  has  established  the  indirect  (visual)  APE  analyzed  for  the  ESP  EIS,  to  be  a 
zone  within  4.9  miles  of  the  tallest  structures  (two  natural  draft  cooling  towers)  associated  with 
the  PPE  representing  a  postulated  nuclear  power  plant  located  on  Artificial  Island;  and 

WHEREAS,  the  NRC  has  identified  historic  properties  within  the  indirect  APE.  Section  2.7  of 
the  ESP  EIS  includes  a  description  of  the  affected  environment,  identification  efforts,  and 
associated  consultation  efforts;  and 

WHEREAS,  the  NRC  has  consulted  with  the  Delaware  State  Historic  Preservation  Office  (DE 
SHPO)  and  determined  that  there  would  be  no  adverse  effects  to  historic  properties  in 
Delaware,  and  the  DE  SHPO  has  concurred  with  the  NRC’s  determination  (see  Section  2.7.3  of 
the  ESP  EIS);  and 

WHEREAS,  the  NRC  has  determined  and  the  New  Jersey  Historic  Preservation  Office  (NJ 
HPO)  has  concurred  that  there  is  no  potential  for  adverse  effects  to  historic  properties  within  the 
direct  APE;  and 

WHEREAS,  the  natural  draft  cooling  tower  option  is  the  only  proposed  cooling  system  analyzed 
for  the  ESP  EIS  that  has  the  potential  to  visually  affect  historic  properties;  and 

WHEREAS,  the  mechanical  draft  cooling  tower  option  analyzed  in  the  ESP  EIS  (see  ESP  EIS 
Section  5.7.2)  at  the  height  of  no  more  than  46  feet  tall  would  not  visually  affect  historic 
properties;  and

Section  2.7  of  the  ESP  EIS  includes  a  description  of  the  affected  environment,  identification 
efforts,  and  associated  consultation;  and 

WHEREAS,  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  National  Historic  Landmark  (NHL),  and  the 
properties  at  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road  and  1 16  Mason  Point  Road  are  historic 
properties  within  the  visual  APE  for  the  ESP  EIS  and  are  within  the  NJ  HPO  proposed  Alloway 
Creek  Rural  Historic  District;  and 

WHEREAS,  the  NRC,  the  NJ  HPO,  and  PSEG  agree  that  the  properties  at  349  Fort  Elfsborg- 
Hancock  Bridge  Road  and  116  Mason  Point  Road,  both  in  Elsinboro  Township,  are  historic 
properties  eligible  for  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  (NRHP)  under  36  CFR  60.4, 
Criteria  A,  B,  and  C,  that  will  be  indirectly  affected  (visual  intrusion  of  two  new  natural  draft 
cooling  towers)  in  the  event  that  the  natural  draft  cooling  tower  option  is  selected  in  the  COL  or 
CP/OL  application;  and 

WHEREAS,  as  required  under  the  NHPA,  the  NRC  has  consulted  with  the  NJ  HPO,  Advisory 
Council  on  Historic  Preservation  (ACHP),  National  Park  Service  (NPS),  and  PSEG,  and  the 
parties  agree  that  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  (127  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge 
Road)  is  a  NHL  on  which  there  would  be  an  indirect  adverse  effect  (visual  intrusion  of  two  new 
natural  draft  cooling  towers)  in  the  event  that  the  natural  draft  cooling  tower  option  is  selected  in 
a  COL  or  CP/OL  application;  and 

WHEREAS,  in  accordance  with  Section  1 10(f)  of  the  NHPA  {54  U.S.C.  306107),  the  NRC  in 
consultation  with  the  parties  has  considered  ways  to  avoid  and  minimize  harm  to  the  NHL;  and 
WHEREAS,  this  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  addresses  the  potential  indirect  adverse 
visual  effect  from  construction  and  operation  of  natural  draft  cooling  towers  as  analyzed  in  the 
ESP  EIS  and  would  conclude  consultation  for  this  undertaking;  and 

WHEREAS,  in  accordance  with  36  CFR  800.6(a)(1 ),  the  NRC,  by  letter  dated  June  24,  2015, 
has  notified  the  ACHP  of  its  determination  of  effects  with  specified  documentation,  and  has 
invited  the  ACHP  to  participate  in  Section  106  consultation  and  development  of  this  MOA  and 
the  ACHP,  by  letter  dated  July  21 ,  2015,  has  chosen  to  participate  pursuant  to  36  CFR 
800.6(a)(1  )(iii);  and  will  be  a  Signatory  to  this  MOA;  and 

WHEREAS,  in  accordance  with  36  CFR  800.10(c),  the  NRC,  by  letter  dated  June  24,  2015,  has 
notified  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  of  its  determination  of  effects  with  specified  documentation 
and  has  invited  the  NPS  to  participate  in  the  Section  106  consultation  and  development  of  this 
MOA  because  of  the  potential  adverse  effects  to  a  NHL  (Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House);  and 

WHEREAS,  the  NRC  has  consulted  with  the  NJ  HPO,  PSEG,  NPS.  and  the  ACHP,  in 
accordance  with  Section  106  of  the  NHPA,  and  its  implementing  regulations  (36  CFR

between  the  Signatories  and  supersedes  all  prior  negotiations,  representations  and 
agreements;  and 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  the  Signatories  agree  that  upon  the  NRC's  decision  to  issue  the  ESP,  the 
NRC  shall  confirm  that  the  following  stipulations  are  implemented  subject  to  the  scope  of  the 
NRC’s  regulatory  authority,  in  order  to  take  into  account  the  visual  effect  of  the  two  potential 
natural  draft  cooling  towers  on  historic  properties.  These  stipulations  shall  govern  the  ESP  until 
this  MOA  expires  or  is  terminated. 

Stipulations 

A.  The  NRC,  consistent  with  its  regulatory  authority,  shall  ensure  that  the  following  stipulations 
would  be  implemented  in  the  event  that  a  COL  or  CP/OL  application  is  submitted: 

1 .  Upon  receipt  of  a  COL  or  CP/OL  application,  the  NRC  shall  notify  all  Signatories 
and  Concurring  Parties  in  writing  that  the  application  was  received  and  initiate 
Section  106  consultation  for  the  COL  or  CP/OL.  The  Section  106  review  for  the 
COL  or  CP/OL  would  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  36  CFR  800  and  may 
include  provisions  for  expediting  consultation,  as  appropriate.  In  its  letter,  the 
NRC  will  identify  the  cooling  system  selected  by  PSEG  in  its  application  and 
include  any  new  and  significant  information  about  the  COL  or  CP/OL  application. 
The  NRC  will  invite  the  public,  including  any  newly  identified  consulting  parties  to 
participate  in  the  Section  106  review  process  as  required  under  36  CFR  800.2(d). 


a.  If  natural  draft  cooling  towers  are  selected,  the  NRC  will  reconfirm  the  indirect 
visual  adverse  effect  to  the  Abel  and  Mary  Nicholson  House  (127  Fort 
Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road)  NHL  and  to  the  NRHP  eligible  properties  at 
349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road  and  116  Mason  Point  Road. 


MOA  among  the  NRC,  NJ  HPO,  ACHP,  and  PSEG  regarding  the  PSEG  ESP  Application 
for  a  site  Located  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey

Appendix  F 


b.  If  mechanical  draft  cooling  towers  that  are  no  more  than  46  feet  in  height  are 
selected,  as  analyzed  in  the  ESP  EIS,  then  the  NRC  will  reiterate  that  there  is 
no  adverse  effect  to  historic  properties  from  this  technology  because  the 
towers  would  not  be  visible  from  any  of  the  known  historic  properties. 


c.  In  an  effort  to  identify  new  and  significant  information,  PSEG  will  have  a 
qualified  contractor,  as  defined  in  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior’s  Professional 
Qualifications  and  Standards  (48  FR  22716,  September  1983),  review  the 
New  Jersey  State  Register  and  the  NRHP  for  any  new  historic  properties 
found  within  the  agreed  upon  APE  of  4.9  miles.  The  contractor  will  also 
conduct  a  review  of  the  NJ  HPO  site  files  for  any  new  historic  properties  that 
were  identified  since  issuance  of  the  ESP  within  the  4.9  mile  APE. 


d.  The  NRC  shall  determine  if  there  would  be  any  new  indirect  visual  adverse 
effects  to  historic  properties  from  the  construction  and  operation  of  natural 
draft  cooling  towers  (not  to  exceed  590  feet  in  height).  The  visual  effect  from 
the  plumes  will  not  be  considered  in  this  analysis  because  they  were 
determined  to  be  ephemeral  and  consistent  with  existing  environmental 
conditions  at  the  ESP  stage  by  the  NRC  and  NJ  HPO. 


2.  The  NRC  will  arrange  a  meeting  to  include  all  Signatories,  Concurring  Parties, 
and  interested  members  of  the  public  to  evaluate  alternatives  or  modifications  to 
the  undertaking  that  could  avoid  or  minimize  adverse  effects  on  historic 
properties.  If,  through  consultation,  the  adverse  effect  cannot  be  avoided  or 
minimized,  then  the  NRC  shall  consult  with  the  Signatories,  Concurring  Parties, 
and  interested  members  of  the  public  to  develop  mitigation  for  the  indirect 
adverse  effect  to  historic  properties  resulting  from  the  construction  of  natural  draft 
cooling  towers.  The  mitigation  will  address  the  visual  effect  to  the  Abel  and  Mary 
Nicholson  House  (127  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road)  NHL,  to  the  NRHP 
eligible  properties  at  349  Fort  Elfsborg-Hancock  Bridge  Road  and  116  Mason 
Point  Road  and  any  historic  properties  that  were  identified  during  the  new  and 
significant  review. 


3.  Following  the  meeting,  the  NRC  will  adhere  to  the  provisions  in  36  CFR  Part  800 
in  the  development  of  a  Section  106  agreement  document  that  is  tied  to  the  ESP 
MOA,  as  appropriate.  The  Section  106  agreement  will  include  stipulations  for 
PSEG’s  unanticipated  discoveries  of  historic  properties  that  may  be  located  on 
Artificial  Island. 

MOA  among  the  NRC,  NJ  HPO,  ACHP,  and  PSEG  regarding  the  PSEG  ESP  Application 
for  a  site  Located  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey

4.  The  public,  interested  parties,  and  the  Signatories  will  have  30  days  to  review 
and  provide  comments  on  the  draft  Section  106  agreement  document.  If 
agreement  cannot  be  reached,  then  the  process  identified  in  Stipulation  D  will  be 
followed. 


5.  The  Section  106  agreement  document  must  be  executed  prior  to  the  issuance  of 
a  COL  or  CP/OL  and  the  stipulations  completed  prior  to  commencing  operation 
of  the  plant  as  described  in  the  COL  or  CP/OL  application.  The  Signatories  and 
Concurring  Parties  to  this  agreement  will  be  notified  in  writing  by  PSEG  when  the 
mitigation  is  completed. 


B.  Amendment  and  Duration 

Any  Signatory  to  this  MOA  may  propose  to  the  other  Signatories  that  this  MOA  be  amended, 
whereupon  the  Signatories  will  consult  in  accordance  with  36  CFR  800.6(c)(7)  to  consider  such 
an  amendment.  Such  amendment  shall  be  effective  upon  the  signature  of  all  Signatories  to  this 
MOA,  and  the  amendment  shall  be  appended  to  the  MOA  as  an  Appendix. 

This  MOA  will  remain  in  effect  for  the  period  of  the  ESP  (up  to  20  years),  pursuant  to  1 0  CFR 
52.26,  until  completion  of  consultation  associated  with  a  COL  or  CP/OL  application,  or  a  Section 
1 06  agreement  document  is  executed.  If  the  terms  of  the  MOA  have  not  been  completed  within 
the  period  of  the  ESP,  pursuant  to  10  CFR  52.26,  this  MOA  shall  be  considered  null  and  void. 

In  such  an  event,  the  NRC  shall  notify  the  parties  and  will  follow  Section  106  for  any  future 
undertakings. 


C.  Anti-Deficiency  Act 

The  stipulations  of  this  MOA  are  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Anti-Deficiency  Act  {31  U.S.C. 
§1341).  If  compliance  with  the  Anti-Deficiency  Act  alters  or  impairs  the  NRC’s  ability  to 
implement  the  stipulations  of  this  MOA,  the  NRC  will  consult  in  accordance  with  the  amendment 
and  termination  procedures  found  in  this  MOA. 


D.  Dispute  Resolution 

Should  any  Signatory  to  this  MOA  object  to  any  activity  pursuant  to  this  MOA,  it  shall  provide 
notice  of  its  objection  within  30  days  of  the  date  of  the  activity.  Upon  receiving  notice  of  the 
objection,  NRC  shall  consult  with  the  objecting  Signatory  to  resolve  the  objection.

Appendix  F 


If  NRC  determines  the  objection  cannot  be  resolved,  NRC  shall  forward  all  documentation 
relevant  to  the  dispute  to  the  ACHP.  Any  comments  or  recommendations  received  from  the 
ACHP  will  be  forwarded  to  the  all  Signatories  for  consideration. 

Prior  to  reaching  a  final  decision  on  the  dispute,  NRC  will  prepare  a  written  resolution  of  the 
objection  taking  into  account  any  timely  advice  or  comments  regarding  the  dispute  from  the 
ACHP  and  Signatories  and  distribute  a  copy  of  the  written  response  to  all  Signatories.  If  a 
Signatory  fails  to  respond  within  30  days  of  receipt  of  the  written  resolution,  concurrence  with 
the  resolution  will  be  assumed  by  the  other  Signatories  and  the  resolution  will  go  into  effect. 

If  resolution  of  the  objection  requires  an  amendment  to  the  MOA,  it  will  be  done  per  Stipulation 
B  of  this  MOA. 

Nothing  in  this  Section  of  the  MOA  shall  be  construed  or  interpreted  as  a  waiver  of  any  judicial 
remedy  available  to  any  party  of  this  MOA. 

Nothing  in  this  Section  shall  be  construed  or  interpreted  to  alter  the  NRC’s  enforcement 
authority  related  to  compliance  with  the  NRC’s  regulations  or  license  conditions. 


E.  Termination 

A  Signatory  proposing  to  terminate  this  MOA  shall  notify  the  other  Signatories,  explaining  the 
reasons  for  termination  and  affording  them  at  least  30  days  to  consult  and  seek  alternatives  to 
termination.  Within  30  days  following  this  notification  of  termination,  any  one  of  the  above 
Signatories  shall  notify  the  other  Signatories  if  it  will:  a)  initiate  consultation  to  execute  a 
subsequent  MOA  that  explicitly  terminates  or  supersedes  its  terms;  or  b)  requests  the 
comments  of  the  ACHP  under  36  CFR  800.7(a)  and  proceed  accordingly.  Concurring  Parties 
do  not  have  the  authority  to  terminate  the  agreement. 

Execution  of  this  MOA  by  the  Signatories  and  implementation  of  its  terms,  is  evidence  that  the 
NRC  has  afforded  the  ACHP  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  indirect  visual  adverse  effect  on 
historic  properties  analyzed  for  the  ESP  EIS,  and  that  the  NRC  has  taken  into  account  the  effect 
on  historic  properties  analyzed  for  the  ESP  EIS.

Re:  Notification  and  Request  for  Consultation  and  Participation  in  the  Scoping  Process  for  the  PSEG 

Early  Site  Permit  Application 

Dear  Mr.  Hatchett: 

The  NOA.Vs  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS),  Northeast  Region.  Habitat  Conservation 
Div  ision  is  in  receipt  of  >our  letter  dated  October  26.  2010  initiating  consultation  and  seeking  our 
involvement  in  the  Scoping  Process  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  by 
PSEG  Power.  LLC  and  PSEG  Nuclear.  LLC'  (PSEG).  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  and  the  east 
bank  of  the  Delaware  River  in  Tower  A I  low  ays  Creek  Township.  Salem  Counts.  New  Jersey 

A  complimentary  compact  disc  containing  complementary  documents  and  figures  to  PSKG's  Site  Safety 
urul Analysis  Report  (SSARj  for  the  proposed  facility,  was  also  included  in  the  Early  Site  Permit  (ESP) 
application  package  for  our  rev  iew. 

According  to  your  letter,  the  Nuclear  Regulator}.  Commission  (NRC)  is  currently  preparing  an 
env  ironmental  impact  statement  ( F  IS)  under  the  prov  isions  of  the  National  Env  ironmental  Policy  Act  of 
1969  (NEPA).  as  amended  In  addition,  the  NRC  has  requested  a  list  of  endangered,  threatened  and 
candidate  species,  and  designated  critical  habitat  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  NMFS.  that  may  be  in  the 
v  icinitv  of  the  PSEG  site  'l  our  letter  further  requests  a  list  of  federal h -managed  species  that  hav  e 
designated  essential  fish  habitat  (EFH)  in  that  area  as  well  as  any  appropriate  information  under  the 
provisions  of  the  Fish  and  W  ildlife  Coordination  Act  of  1984.  as  amended 

PSEG  currentlv  has  three  operating  nuclear  reactors.  Salem  Units  I  and  2.  and  Hope  Creek  Unit  I.  The 
proposed  construction  site  will  encompass  approximate!)  XI9  acres  immediately  adjacent  and  to  the  north 
of  the  existing  units  at  the  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station  (SHCNGS). 

Impacts  to  the  quality  of  surface  waters  and  the  alteration  of  river  bottom  sediments  within  the  Delaware 
River  and  adjacent  marsh  creeks  are  expected  as  a  result  of  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  proposed 
facility,  and  will  include  those  associated  with  the  development  of  shoreline  features  (intake  structure, 
barge  facility,  heavy  haul  road),  dredging  ot  sediments  from  the  near-shore  area  of  the  Delaware  River  to 
prov  ide  for  water  intake  and  discharge  3nd  to  prov  idc  adequate  draft  for  barge  access  during  construction, 
and  the  filling  of  9.5  acres  of  coastal  tidal  wetlands  and  shallow  open  water  areas. 


November  2015 


F-43 


NUREG-2168 


Appendix  F 


The  construction  of  the  new  intake  structure  and  the  new  barge  unloading  facility  and  mooring  area  w  ill 
result  in  the  deepening  of  the  existing  river  bottom  (-10  ft.  MLLW)  by  an  average  of  4.5  ft.  over  an  area 
of  3  1  acres  (volume  of  1 50,000  cubic  yards),  and  an  area  of  6 1  acres,  (a  volume  of  440,000  cubic  yards), 
respectively.  The  total  area  to  be  dredged  is  92  acres  extending  riverward  1700  ft.  from  the  shoreline. 
Dredging  techniques  may  include  both  mechanical  and  hydraulic  dredging  methods  and  the  material 
removed  as  part  of  this  construction  activity  will  be  transported  to  and  placed  in  an  on-site  or  other 
approved  upland  disposal  facility. 

Increases  in  turbidity  through  the  resuspension  of  sediments  into  the  water  column  from  dredging  and 
port  operations  will  degrade  water  quality,  lower  dissolved  oxygen  levels,  and  potentially  release 
chemical  contaminants  bound  to  the  fine-grained  estuarine/marine  sediments.  Sedimentation  and  wave 
patterns  in  the  area  may  be  altered  as  a  result  of  vessels  entering  and  exiting  the  proposed  mooring  area 
also  resulting  in  increased  turbidity.  Suspended  sediments  mask  pheromones  used  by  migratory'  fishes, 
and  can  smother  immobile  benthic  organisms  and  demersal  newly-settle  juvenile  fish  (Auld  and  Schubel 
1978:  Dreitburg  1988:  Newcombe  and  MacDonald  1991;  Burton  1993;  Nelson  and  Wheeler  1997).  As 
supported  above,  the  project  area  provides  important  habitat  for  striped  bass  including  valuable  spawning 
grounds  and  nursery  habitat.  Increases  in  turbidity  will  adversely  affect  striped  bass  larvae’s  ability  to 
capture  prey  (Fay  ct  al.  1983  in  Able  and  Fahay  1998).  The  decrease  in  water  circulation  can  also 
adversely  affect  striped  bass  survival  as  strong  current  is  needed  to  keep  the  eggs  suspended  in  the  water 
column  and  prevent  them  from  being  smothered  by  sill  (Bigelow  and  Schroeder  1953). 

Guidelines  under  Section  404(bXl)  of  the  federal  Clean  Water  Act  require  that  actions  proposed  within 
“waters  of  the  United  States,”  especially  those  that  are  not  water-dependent,  are  required  to  demonstrate 
that  they  have  considered  all  appropriate  reasonable  and  prudent  measures  to  avoid  and  minimize  impacts 
to  waters.  If  all  measures  to  avoid  and  minimize  wetland  impacts  have  been  considered  and  employed  to 
the  extent  practicable  and  result  in  unavoidable  impacts,  a  compensatory  mitigation  plan  should  be 
developed  and  implemented. 

The  applicant  should  undertake  a  complete  analysis  of  alternatives  that  complies  fully  with  the  Clean 
Water  Act  Section  404  (bX  1 )  Guidelines  that  documents  avoidance,  minimization  and  mitigation  for  all 
impacts.  Alternate  locations  as  well  as  a  documentation  of  purpose  and  need  should  be  provided  as  part 
of  this  analysis.  I  or  any  unavoidable  impacts,  a  compensatory  mitigation  plan  to  offset  all  of  the  projects 
impacts  to  aquatic  resources  including  EFII  should  be  developed  in  accordance  with  the  federal  standards 
and  criteria  for  compensatory  mitigation  for  losses  of  aquatic  resources  published  in  the  Federal  Register 
on  April  10,  2008  (vol.  73  No.  70).  This  plan  should  be  developed  as  early  in  the  permit  process  as 
possible  and  in  consultation  with  the  applicable  federal,  state  and  local  resource  agencies  and  will  be 
implemented  on  and  in  the  immediate  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  to  the  extent  practicable. 

In  the  State  of  NJ.  coastal  wetlands  are  regulated  by  the  state  under  the  Wetlands  Act  of  1970. 
Development  in  coastal  wetlands  requires  authorization  of  permits  from  the  NJDEP,  and  requires  separate 
processes  to  determine  a  project's  value.  However,  such  processes  usually  fit  in  within  a  federal  process. 

After  reasonable  measures  have  been  explored  to  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  to  wetlands,  PSEG  will 
compensate  for  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  wetlands  by  implementing  approved  wetland  restoration 
and/or  rehabilitation  measures.  PSEG,  through  their  Ecosystem  Enhancement  Program,  has  extensive 
experience  and  demonstrated  success  implementing  coastal  saltmarsh  and  freshwater  wetland  restoration 
and  rehabilitation  programs.  This  familiarity  with  local  wetland  systems  was  used  to  identify  appropriate 
candidate  mitigation  sites  and  w  ill  be  used  in  developing  and  implementing  the  final  approved  mitigation 
plan.

Mitigation  options  mentioned  in  the  NRC’s  ESP  to  offset  the  impacts  to  NOAA  trust  resources  included 
the  following  considerations: 

•  Minimization  of  encroachment  on  coastal  wetlands 

•  Use  of  previously  developed  sediment  disposal  basins  for  plant  development  (both  PSEG’s 
permitted  disposal  facility  and  the  USAGE’S  CDF) 

•  Refinement  of  the  Site  Utilization  Plan  to  avoid  various  wetland  areas  throughout  the  PSEG  Site 

Opportunities  for  mitigating  unavoidable  impacts  to  wetland  ecosystems  include  restoration  of  natural 
habitats  temporarily  disturbed  by  construction,  creation  of  new  habitat  types  in  previously  disturbed  areas, 
and  enhancement  of  undisturbed  natural  habitats. 

In  general,  NMFS  does  not  accept  the  conversion  of  one  type  of  aquatic  habitat  into  another  habitat  as 
compensatory  mitigation  when  the  existing  habitat  has  value  to  aquatic  life.  Candidate  mitigation  areas 
include  portions  of  the  existing  PSEG  Site,  Mannington  Meadow.  Mason's  Point,  and  additional  areas  of 
the  PSEG  Alloway  Creek  Watershed  restoration  site. 

Magnuson  Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Management  Act  (MSA) 

Section  305  (b)(2)  of  the  1996  amendments  to  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and 
Management  Act  (MSA)  requires  all  federal  agencies  to  consult  w  ith  NOAA  Fisheries  on  any  action, 
including  those  proposed  by  the  NRC,  that  is  authorized,  funded,  or  undertaken  by  that  agency  and  that 
may  adversely  affect  EFH.  Included  in  this  consultation  process  is  the  preparation  of  a  complete  and 
appropriate  EFH  assessment  to  provide  necessary  information  on  which  to  consult.  Our  EFH  regulation 
at  50  CFR  600.905  mandates  the  preparation  of  EFH  assessments  and  generally  outlines  each  agency's 
obligations  in  this  consultation  procedure. 

The  estuarine  portions  of  the  Delaw  are  River  and  its  tributaries  including  the  estuarine  areas  of  both 
Allow  ay  and  Hope  Creeks  have  been  designated  as  EFH  for  a  wide  variety'  of  species  including  red  hake 
( Urophycis  chuss ),  w  inter  flounder  ( Pseudupleurunecles  americcmus ),  w  indow  pane  flounder 
( Scop ht hut rnus  aquosus),  bluefish  ( Pomatomus  sahatrix),  Atlantic  butterfish  (Peprilus  triacanthus ),  scup 
(Slenotomus  chrysops),  summer  flounder  ( Paralichthys  deni  at  u.s).  scup  (Slenotomus  chrysops ),  black  sea 
bass  ( Centropristis  striata),  king  mackerel  ( Scumberomurus  cavalla),  Spanish  mackerel  ( Scomberomorus 
niaculatus),  cobia  ( Rachycenlrvn  canadum ),  little  skate  (Leucoraja  erinacea),  winter  skate  ( Leucoruja 
ocellala)  and  cleamose  skate  ( Raja  eglanteria).  A  more  detailed  listing  of  EFH  and  federally  managed 
species  and  EFH  consultation  requirements  can  be  found  on  our  website  at:  w  ww.nero.nmfs.gov/hcd. 

The  EFH  final  rule  published  in  the  Federal  Register  on  January-  17,  2002  defines  an  adverse  effect  as: 
"any  impact  which  reduces  the  quality  and/or  quantity  of  EFH.”  flic  rule  further  slates  that: 

“An  adverse  effect  may  include  direct  or  indirect  physical,  chemical,  or  biological  alterations  of 
the  waters  or  substrate  and  loss  of,  or  injury  to.  benthic  organisms,  prey  species  and  their  habitat 
and  other  ecosy  stems  components,  if  such  modifications  reduce  the  quality  and/or  quantity  of 
EFH.  Adverse  effects  to  EFH  may  result  from  action  occurring  within  EFH  or  outside  EFH  and 
may  include  site-specific  or  habitat-w  ide  impacts,  including  individual,  cumulative,  or  synergistic 
consequences  of  actions. 

The  rule  also  states: 

I. oss  of  prey  may  be  an  adverse  effect  on  EFH  and  managed  species  because  the  presence  of  prey 
makes  waters  and  substrate  function  as  feeding  habitat  and  the  definition  of  EFH  includes  waters 
and  substrate  necessary-  to  fish  for  feeding.  Therefore,  actions  that  reduce  the  availability  of  a

major  prey  species,  cither  through  direct  harm  or  capture,  or  through  adverse  impacts  to  the  prey 
species'  habitat  that  are  known  to  cause  a  reduction  in  the  population  of  the  prey  species,  may  be 
considered  adverse  efTects  on  EFH  if  such  actions  reduce  the  quality  of  EFI 1. 

In  order  to  initiate  consultation  pursuant  to  the  MSA.  the  NRC  must  submit  a  full  and  complete  EFH 
assessment  that  considers  the  individual  and  cumulative  and  the  direct  and  indirect  impacts  of  the 
proposed  project  on  EFH.  federal  managed  species  and  their  prey  recognizing  the  definition  of  adverse 
impact  discussed  above.  The  required  contents  of  an  EFH  assessment  includes:  1 )  a  description  of  the 
action:  2)  an  analysis  of  the  potential  adverse  efTects  of  the  action  on  EFH  and  the  managed  species:  3) 
the  NRCs  conclusions  regarding  the  efTects  of  the  action  on  EFH;  4)  proposed  mitigation,  if  applicable. 
Given  the  scope  of  this  project,  other  information  that  should  be  contained  in  the  EFH  assessment 
includes:  1)  the  results  of  on-site  inspections  to  evaluate  the  habitat  and  site-specific  efTects:  2)  the  views 
of  recognized  experts  on  the  habitat  or  the  species  that  may  be  affected;  3)  a  review  of  pertinent  literature 
and  related  information;  and  5)  an  analysis  of  alternatives  to  the  action  that  could  avoid  or  minimize  the 
adverse  efTects  on  EFI  I. 

Fish  and  Wildlife  Coordination  Act 

Notwithstanding  our  mandates  under  the  MSA.  the  NMFS  also  has  responsibilities  under  the  Fish  and 
Wildlife  Coordination  Act  (FWCA)  to  provide  federal  agencies  such  as  the  NRC  with  recommendations 
to  avoid,  minimize  and  to  mitigate  for  direct,  indirect  and  cumulative  impacts  to  any  and  all  NOAA  trust 
resources  that  are  present  within  the  Delaware  River  Basin. 

The  Delaware  Estuary  including  its  tributaries  provides  habitat  for  a  w  idc  variety  of  NOAA  trust 
resources  including  alewife  (Alosa psevdoharengus ),  American  eel  ( Anguilla  rostrata)  American  shad 
( Alosa  sapidissima ),  Atlantic  croaker  ( Micropogonias  undulatus).  Atlantic  menhaden  ( Brevoortia 
tyrannus),  Atlantic  sturgeon  ( Acipenser  oxyrinchus),  blueback  herring  ( Alosa  aestivalis),  blucfish. 
hickory  shad  (Alosa  mediocris),  spot  (Leiostomus  xanthurus)  tautog  ( Tautoga  ortilis),  weakfish.  white 
perch  ( Morone  americana),  yellow  perch  (Perea  flcnescens),  striped  bass  (Morone  saxatilis ),  hogchoker 
( Trinectes  rnaculatus),  ki  1 1 i fish,  bay  anchovy,  silversides,  mumniichog  and  may  others. 

Because  landing  statistics  and  the  number  of  fish  observed  on  annual  spawning  runs  indicate  a  drastic 
decline  in  alewife  and  blueback  herring  populations  throughout  much  of  their  range  since  the  mid- 1960’s, 
they  have  been  designated  as  species  of  concern  by  NMFS  in  a  Federal  Register  Notice  dated  October  17. 
2006  (71  FRN  61022).  "Species  of  concern”  are  those  species  about  which  NMFS  has  some  concerns 
regarding  status  and  threats,  but  for  which  insufficient  information  is  available  to  indicate  a  need  to  list 
the  species  under  the  Endangered  Species  Act.  The  shallow  w  ater  environment  in  this  section  of  the 
Delaware  River  provides  valuable  habitat  for  these  species  as  well  as  striped  bass  and  American  shad. 

The  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDF1P)  also  has  sampled  the  Delaware  River 
and  Bay  in  the  project  area  for  nearly  30  years  since  1980.  This  long-term  survey  documents  the  use  of 
the  this  portion  of  the  river  by  a  w  ide  variety  of  species  including  blueback  herring,  alewife,  American 
shad  American  shad  (Alosa  sapidisstma),  American  eel  (Anguilla  rostrata),  Atlantic  herring  (Clupea 
harengus),  Atlantic  menhaden  (Brevoortia  tyrannus),  bay  anchovy,  (Anchoa  milchilli),  blueback  herring, 
gizzard  shad  (Dorosoma  cepedianum),  hogchoker  (Trinectes  rnaculatus),  striped  bass,  yellow  perch 
(Perea Jlavescens),  white  perch  (Morone  americana),  Atlantic  silverside  (Menidia  rnenidia),  and  many 
others  (NJDEP  2010).  Many  of  these  species  are  both  commercially  and  recreational ly  important  and 
managed  by  the  ASFMC  or  are  valuable  prey  species  for  ASFMC  or  federally  managed  fish. 

Buckcl  and  Conover  (1997)  in  Fahey  et  al.  ( 1999)  reports  that  diet  items  of  juvenile  bluefish  include 
Alosa  species  such  American  shad,  blueback  herring  and  alewife  as  well  as  bay  anchovy,  silversides  and 
other  fish  species.  We  note  that  the  NJDEP  survey  data  show  that  federally  managed  blucfish  are  present

in  the  project  area.  This  indicates  that  both  the  prey  species  and  the  predator  are  present  in  the  Delaware 
River  in  and  around  the  project  area.  Juvenile  Alosa  species  have  all  been  identified  as  prey  species  for 
windowpane  (Scophihalmus  aquosus)  and  summer  flounder  (Paralichthys  dentatus)  in  Steimle  el  al. 
(2000).  Windowpane  and  summer  flounder  are  federally  managed  species  whose  EFH  has  been 
designated  in  the  mixing  zone  of  the  Delaware  River 

Submerged  aquatic  vegetation  (SAV)  has  historically  been  absent  from  Delaware  Bay.  However,  to  date, 
there  has  been  no  comprehensive  mapping  of  SAV  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  to  verify  its  presence  or 
absence.  .Several  species  have  been  observed  though  in  the  tidal  river  since  1970,  including:  Vallisneria 
americunu ,  Myriophyllum  spicalum.  Elodea  nuttallii,  Najas  Jlexilhs,  Potamogeton  sp.  and  others 
(Schuy  ler,  1988).  Wild  celery  (  Vallisneria  americana)  has  been  documented  in  some  areas  of  the 
Delaware  River  and  its  tributaries.  SAV  provides  valuable  nursery,  forage  and  refuge  habitat  for  a  variety 
of  fish  including  striped  bass,  American  shad,  alcwife.  and  blueback  herring.  It  is  also  an  important  food 
source  for  waterfowl.  As  water  quality  in  the  Delaware  River  continues  to  improve,  more  areas  of  SAV 
may  be  found  within  the  River. 

Nati\e  eastern  oysters  (Crassostrca  virgin  ica)  are  an  ecologically  important  species.  According  to  the 
New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection,  an  expansive  area  of  oy  ster  habitat  has  been 
identified  near  the  SHCNGS  .  In  recent  years,  efforts  have  been  made  to  restore  oyster  beds  in  Delaware 
Bay.  Since  2004.  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  has  w  orked  w  ith  the  States  of  New  Jersey  and  Delaw  are 
to  plant  shell  in  portions  of  natural  oyster  beds  in  Delaware  Bay 
(http:  www.delawnreestiiarv.org/science  proiects  ovster  restoration. asp). 

Blue  crab  ( Callinecies  sapidns)  can  also  be  found  in  the  vicinity  of  the  SHCNGS.  The  crabs  can 
generally  be  found  in  the  lower  salinity  areas  of  the  estuary  in  the  summer  and  higher  salinities  in  the 
winter.  Following  mating  in  the  summer,  which  typically  occurs  in  lower  salinity  waters,  the  females 
move  to  high  salinity  waters  found  in  the  Delaware  Bay  to  spawn.  After  spawning,  the  larvae  move 
toward  the  lower  salinity'  areas  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  to  mature. 

Endangered  and  Threatened  Species 

The  Atlantic  sturgeon  ( Acipenser  oxyrinchns)  may  be  found  in  the  Delaware  River  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
project  area  at  certain  times  of  the  year.  On  October  6,  2010,  NOAA  issued  a  Federal  Register  Notice  (75 
FRN  61872).  The  notice  identifies  the  Hudson  River  and  Delaware  River  Atlantic  sturgeon  stocks  as  a 
distinct  population  segment  (DPS)  called  the  New  York  Bight  DPS.  This  DPS  has  been  proposed  to  be 
listed  as  endangered.  The  Atlantic  Sturgeon  Status  Review  Team  (ASSRT)  identified  15  different 
stressors  that  may  impact  the  Atlantic  sturgeon  populations  including  poor  water  quality  and  habitat  loss 
(2007).  Dredging  and  vessel  strikes  are  also  considered  to  be  important  stressors  on  the  populations  of 
Atlantic  sturgeon  (75  fRN  61872  etseq.)  According  to  the  ASSRT  (2007).  Ryder  ( 1 888)  suggested  that 
juvenile  Atlantic  sturgeon  used  the  tidal  freshwater  reach  of  the  Delaware  River  as  a  nursery  area  and 
Lazzari  et  al.  (1986)  frequently  captured  juv  enile  Atlantic  sturgeon  from  May  -  December  in  the  upper 
tidal  portion  of  the  river  below  Trenton.  New  Jersey. 

Shortnose  sturgeon  ( Acipenser  breviroslrum)  ty  pically  occurs  in  deep  water  channels  although  they  do 
occur  in  the  shallower  waters  w  hile  foraging.  Fhe  abundance  of  adult  shortnose  sturgeon  is  greatest  in  the 
tidal  river  from  Trenton  to  Philadelphia  (Hastings  et  al.  1987;  O'Herron  et  al.  1993).  In-water 
construction  activ  ities  can  affect  shortnose  and  Atlantic  sturgeon  through  direct  injury  or  mortality, 
displacing  species  from  the  area,  or  by  altering  the  habitat  and  destroy  ing  forage  items. 

Shortnose  sturgeon  ( Acipenser  breviroslrum)  ty  pically  occurs  in  deep  water  channels  although  they  do 
occur  in  the  shallower  waters  similar  to  that  of  the  project  area  while  foraging.  Any  discretionary  federal 
action,  such  as  the  approval  or  funding  of  a  project  by  a  Federal  agency  ,  that  may  affect  a  listed  species

Re;  PSEG  Early  Site  Permit  Application 
Dear  Mr.  Lee, 

This  letter  provides  updated  information  on  resources  under  the  jurisdiction  of  NOAA’s  National 
Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  located  near  the  existing  Hope  Creek  and  Salem  Nuclear  Plants 
in  Salem  County,  New'  Jersey.  The  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  is  preparing  an 
Environmental  Impact  Statement  (E1S)  regarding  the  effects  of  granting  an  Early  Site  Permit  (ESP) 
for  construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  site  on  Artificial  Island,  New  Jersey.  PSEG  currently 
has  three  operating  nuclear  reactors,  Salem  Units  1  and  2,  and  Hope  Creek  Unit  1.  The  proposed 
construction  site  will  encompass  approximately  819  acres  immediately  adjacent  and  to  the  north  of 
the  existing  units  at  the  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  Nuclear  Generating  Station  (SHCNGS).  We 
previously  provided  information  on  our  trust  resources  to  PSEG  in  2009  and  to  NRC  in  2010. 
Below,  we  provide  updated  information  on  trust  resources  and  your  consultation  responsibilities. 

Endangered  Species  Act 

Several  species  listed  by  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  occur  in  the  Delaware  River 
where  the  intake  for  a  new  unit  would  be  located.  Four  species  of  sea  turtles  occur  seasonally  (May 
-  November)  in  the  Delaware  River  estuary,  including  the  threatened  Northwest  Atlantic  Distinct 
Population  Segment  (DPS)  of  loggerhead  sea  turtles  ( Caretta  caretta ).  and  endangered  Kemp’s 
ndiey  ( Lepidochelys  kempi),  green  ( Chelonia  mydas),  and  leatherback  ( Dermochelys  coriacea)  sea 
Turtles.  Additionally,  a  population  of  endangered  shortnose  sturgeon  ( Acipenser  breviroslrum) 
occurs  in  the  Delaware  River,  individuals  from  any  of  the  five  listed  DPSs  of  Atlantic  sturgeon 
[Acipenser  oxvrinchus  oxynnchus)  also  occur  in  the  Delaware  River.  More  information  on  these 
species  is  available  on  our  website 

(’http://www.nero. noaa.gov/protected/seccion7/listing/index.html). 

As  you  know,  consultation  pursuant  to  Section  7  of  the  ESA  between  NRC  and  NMFS  on  the 
effects  of  the  operation  of  the  existing  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  facilities  has  been  ongoing  since 
1979.  Most  recently,  a  Biological  Opinion  was  issued  by  us  on  May  14,  1993  concluding  the 
ongoing  operation  was  not  likely  to  jeopardize  shortnose  sturgeon,  Kemp’s  ridley,  green  or 
loggerhead  sea  turtles.  This  Opinion  was  amended  by  a  letter  dated  January  21,  1999,  which 
modified  the  Incidental  Take  Statement.  A  new  Biological  Opinion  is  currently  in  process  and

Appendix  F 


drafts  have  been  reviewed  by  PSEG  and  NRC  staff.  We  expect  the  EIS  being  prepared  for  a  new 
nuclear  unit  to  consider  effects  of  construction  and  operation  on  all  NMFS  listed  species. 
Specifically,  the  EIS  should  consider  the  potential  for  impingement  and  entrainment  of  listed 
species  and  their  prey,  discharge  of  pollutants,  including  heated  effluent,  and  effects  of  shoreline 
construction,  including  dredging. 

As  noted  in  your  letter,  the  ESP  will  not  authorize  the  construction  or  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
unit.  Section  7(a)(2)  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  (ESA)  of  1973,  as  amended,  states  that  each 
Federal  agency  shall,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary,  insure  that  any  action  they  authorize,  fund, 
or  carry  out  is  not  likely  to  jeopardize  the  continued  existence  of  a  listed  species  or  result  in  the 
destruction  or  adverse  modification  of  designated  critical  habitat.  Any  discretionary  federal  action 
that  may  affect  a  listed  species  must  undergo  Section  7  consultation.  If  you  determine  that  the 
proposed  action  is  “not  likely  to  adversely  affect”  any  listed  species  (i.e.,  when  direct  or  indirect 
effects  of  the  proposed  project  or  its  interdependent  and/or  interrelated  actions  on  listed  species  are 
expected  to  be  discountable,  insignificant  or  completely  beneficial),  you  should  send  us  a  letter 
documenting  your  determination,  providing  justification  and  requesting  our  concurrence.  If  we 
concur  with  this  determination,  we  will  reply  in  a  letter  that  will  convey  the  concurrence,  thus 
completing  Section  7  consultation.  If  you  determine  the  project  is  “likely  to  adversely  affect’’  any 
listed  species  (i.e.,  if  any  adverse  effect  to  listed  species  may  occur  as  a  direct  or  indirect  result  of 
the  proposed  action  or  its  interrelated  or  interdependent  actions,  and  the  effects  are  not: 
discountable,  insignificant,  or  beneficial)  or  we  do  not  concur  with  your  “not  likely  to  adversely 
affect”  determination,  then  formal  Section  7  consultation,  resulting  in  the  issuance  of  a  Biological 
Opinion  with  an  appropriate  Incidental  Take  Statement,  may  be  required.  Any  effects  that  amount 
to  the  take  of  a  listed  species  (defined  by  the  ESA  as  “to  harass,  harm,  pursue,  hunt,  shoot,  wound, 
kill,  trap,  capture,  or  collect,  or  to  attempt  to  engage  in  any  such  conduct”)  are  not  discountable, 
insignificant  or  entirely  beneficial.  Therefore,  if  any  take  is  anticipated,  formal  consultation  is 
required.  NMFS  staff  is  available  to  discuss  the  proposed  project  and  assist  you  in  determining  the 
likely  effects  of  the  proposed  action. 

Magnuson  Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Management  Act  (MSA) 

Section  305  (b)(2)  of  the  1996  amendments  to  the  Magnuson -Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and 
Management  Act  (MSA)  requires  all  federal  agencies  to  consult  with  us  on  any  action,  including 
those  proposed  by  the  NRC,  that  is  authorized,  funded,  or  undertaken  by  that  agency  and  that  may 
adversely  affect  EFH.  Included  in  this  consultation  process  is  the  preparation  of  a  complete  and 
appropriate  EFH  assessment  to  provide  necessary  information  on  which  to  consult.  Our  EFH 
regulation  at  50  CFR  600.905  mandates  the  preparation  of  EFH  assessments  and  generally  outlines 
each  agency's  obligations  in  this  consultation  procedure. 

The  estuarine  portions  of  the  Delaware  River  and  its  tributanes  including  the  estuarine  areas  of  both 
Alloway  and  Hope  Creeks  have  been  designated  as  EFH  for  a  wide  vanety  of  species  including  red 
hake  ( Urophycis  chuss),  winter  flounder  ( Pseudopleuronectes  americanus ),  windowpane  flounder  ( 
Scophthalmus  aquosus),  bluefish  ( Pomatomus  saltatrix),  Atlantic  butterfish  ( Peprilus  triacanthus), 
scup  ( Stenotomus  chrysops),  summer  flounder  ( Paralichthys  denlatus ),  scup  ( Stenolomus  chrysops ), 
black  sea  bass  ( Centropristis  striata),  king  mackerel  {Scomberomorus  cavalla),  Spanish  mackerel 
{Scomberomorus  maculatus),  cobia  ( Rachycentron  canadum ),  little  skate  ( Leucoraja  erinacea), 
winter  skate  ( Leucoraja  ocellata)  and  cleamose  skate  ( Raja  eglanteria).  A  more  detailed  listing  of

EFH  and  federally  managed  species  and  EFH  consultation  requirements  can  be  found  on  our 
website  at:  wvAv.nero.nmfs.gov/hcd. 

The  EFH  final  rule  published  in  the  Federal  Register  on  January  17,  2002  defines  an  adverse  effect 
as:  "any  impact  which  reduces  the  quality  and/or  quantity  of  EFH."  The  rule  further  states  that: 

"An  adverse  effect  may  include  direct  or  indirect  physical,  chemical,  or  biological 
alterations  of  the  waters  or  substrate  and  loss  of,  or  injury  to,  benthic  organisms,  prey 
species  and  their  habitat  and  other  ecosystems  components,  if  such  modifications  reduce 
the  quality  and/or  quantity  of  EFH.  Adverse  effects  to  EFH  may  result  from  action  occurring 
within  EFH  or  outside  EFH  and  may  include  site-specific  or  habitat-wide  impacts, 
including  individual,  cumulative,  or  synergistic  consequences  of  actions." 

The  rule  also  states: 

“Loss  of  prey  may  be  an  adverse  effect  on  EFH  and  managed  species  because  the  presence 
of  prey  makes  waters  and  substrate  function  as  feedtng  habitat  and  the  definition  of  EFH 
includes  waters  and  substrate  necessary  to  fish  for  feeding.  Therefore,  actions  that  reduce 
the  availability  of  a  species’  habitat  that  are  known  to  cause  a  reduction  in  the  population  of 
the  prey  species,  may  be  considered  adverse  effects  on  EFH  if  such  actions  reduce  the 
quality  of  EFH.” 

In  order  to  initiate  consultation  pursuant  to  the  MSA,  you  must  submit  a  full  and  complete  EFH 
assessment  that  considers  the  individual  and  cumulative  and  the  direct  and  indirect  impacts  of  the 
proposed  project  on  EFH,  federal  managed  species  and  their  prey  recognizing  the  definition  of 
adverse  impact  discussed  above.  The  required  contents  of  an  EFH  assessment  includes:  1)  a 
description  of  the  action;  2)  an  analysis  of  the  potential  adverse  effects  of  the  action  on  EFH  and  the 
managed  species;  3)  the  NRC's  conclusions  regarding  the  effects  of  the  action  on  EFH;  4)  proposed 
mitigation,  if  applicable.  Given  the  scope- of  this  project,  other  information  that  should  be  contained 
in  the  EFH  assessment  includes:  1)  the  results  of  on-site  inspections  to  evaluate  the  habitat  and  site- 
specific  effects;  2)  the  views  of  recognized  experts  on  the  habitat  or  the  species  that  may  be 
affected;  3)  a  review  of  pertinent  literature  and  related  information;  and  4)  an  analysis  of 
alternatives  to  the  action  that  could  avoid  or  minimize  the  adverse  effects  on  EFH. 

Fish  and  Wildlife  Coordination  Act 

We  also  have  responsibilities  under  the  Fish  and  Wildlife  Coordination  Act  (FWCA)  to  provide 
federal  agencies  such  as  the  NRC  with  recommendations  to  avoid,  minimize  and  to  mitigate  for 
direct,  indirect  and  cumulative  impacts  to  any  and  all  NOAA  trust  resources  that  are  present  within 
the  Delaware  River  Basin. 

The  Delaware  Estuary  including  its  tributaries  provides  habitat  for  a  wide  vanety  of  NOAA  trust 
resources  including:  aiewife  {A  l  os  a  pseudoharengus),  American  eel  (Anguilla  rostrata),  American 
shad  ( Alosa  sapidissima ),  Atlantic  croaker  { Micropogonias  undulatas),  Atlantic  menhaden 
(Brevoortia  lyrannus),  Atlantic  sturgeon,  blueback  herring  {Alosa  aestivalis),  bluefish,  hickory  shad 
(Alosa  mediocris),  spot  { Leiostomus  xanthurus )  tautog  ( Tautoga  onitis),  weakfish,  white  perch 
{Marone  americana),  yellow  perch  (Percajlavescens),  striped  bass  ( Marone  saxatilis),  hogchoker 
( Trinectes  maculaius ),  killifish,  bay  anchovy,  silversides,  mummichog  and  many  others.

Landing  statistics  and  the  number  of  fish  observed  on  annual  spawning  runs  indicate  a  drastic 
decline  in  alewife  and  blueback  herring  populations  throughout  much  of  their  range  since  the  mid- 
1 960’s.  The  shallow  water  environment  in  this  section  of  the  Delaware  River  provides  valuable 
habitat  for  these  species  as  well  as  striped  bass  and  American  shad. 

The  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  also  has  sampled  the  Delaware 
River  and  Bay  in  the  project  area  for  nearly  30  years  since  1980.  This  long-term  survey  documents 
the  use  of  this  portion  of  the  river  by  a  wide  variety  of  species  including:  blueback  herring,  alewife, 
American  shad  ( Alosa  sapidissima),  American  eel  ( Anguilla  roslrata),  Atlantic  herring  ( Clupea 
harengus),  Atlantic  menhaden  ( Brevooriia  tyrannus),  bay  anchovy,  { Anchoa  mitchillf),  biueback 
herring,  gizzard  shad  (Dorosoma  cepedianum),  hogchoker  (Trinectes  maculatus),  striped  bass, 
yellow  perch  ( Percajlavescens ),  white  perch  ( Marone  americana ),  Atlantic  silverside  ( Menidia 
menidia),  and  many  others  (NJDEP  2010).  Many  of  these  species  are  both  commercially  and 
recreationally  important  and  managed  by  the  ASFMC  or  are  valuable  prey  species  for  ASFMC  or 
federally  managed  fish. 

Buckel  and  Conover  (1997)  in  Fahey  et  al.  (1999)  reports  that  diet  items  of  juvenile  bluefish  include 
Alosa  species  such  as  American  shad,  blueback  herring  and  alewife  as  well  as  bay  anchovy, 
silversides  and  other  fish  species.  We  note  that  the  NJDEP  survey  data  show  that  federally 
managed  bluefish  are  present  in  the  project  area.  This  indicates  that  both  the  prey  species  and  the 
predator  are  present  in  the  Delaware  River  in  and  around  the  project  area.  Juvenile  Alosa  species 
have  all  been  identified  as  prey  species  for  windowpane  ( Scophthalmus  aquosus)  and  summer 
flounder  ( Paralichthys  dentatus)  in  Steimle  et  al.  (2000).  Windowpane  and  summer  flounder  are 
federally  managed  species  whose  EFH  has  been  designated  in  the  mixing  zone  of  the  Delaware 
River 

Submerged  aquatic  vegetation  (SAV)  has  historically  been  absent  from  Delaware  Bay.  However,  to 
date,  there  has  been  no  comprehensive  mapping  of  SAV  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  to  verify  its 
presence  or  absence.  Several  species  have  been  observed  though  in  the  tidal  river  since  1970, 
including:  Vallisneria  americana ,  Myriophyllum  spicatum,  Elodea  nuttallii,  Najasjlexillis, 
Potamogeton  sp.  and  others  (Schuyler,  1988).  Wild  celery  (Vallisneria  americana)  has  been 
documented  in  some  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  and  its  tributaries.  SAV  provides  valuable 
nursery,  forage  and  refuge  habitat  for  a  variety  of  fish  including  striped  bass,  American  shad, 
alewife,  and  blueback  herring.  It  is  also  an  important  food  source  for  waterfowl.  As  water  quality 
in  the  Delaware  River  continues  to  improve,  more  areas  of  SAV  may  be  found  within  the  River. 

Native  eastern  oysters  ( Crassostrea  virginica )  are  an  ecologically  important  species.  According  to 
the  NJDEP,  an  expansive  area  of  oyster  habitat  has  been  identified  near  the  SHCNGS.  In  recent 
years,  efforts  have  been  made  to  restore  oyster  beds  in  Delaware  Bay.  Since  2004,  the  Army  Corps 
of  Engineers  has  worked  with  the  States  of  New  Jersey  and  Delaware  to  plant  shell  in  portions  of 
natural  oyster  beds  in  Delaware  Bay 

(httr»://www. delawareestuary.org/science  projects  oyster  restoration. aspf 

Blue  crab  ( Callinectes  sapidus )  can  also  be  found  in  the  vicinity  of  the  SHCNGS.  The  crabs  can 
generally  be  found  in  the  lower  salinity  areas  of  the  estuary  in  the  summer  and  higher  salinities  in 
the  winter.  Following  mating  in  the  summer,  which  typically  occurs  in  lower  salinity  waters,  the

females  move  to  high  salinity  waters  found  in  the  Delaware  Bay  to  spawn.  After  spawning,  the 
larvae  move  toward  the  lower  salinity  areas  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  to  mature. 

Other  Comments  from  NMFS  Habitat  Conservation  Division 

The  construction  of  the  new  intake  structure  and  the  new  barge  unloading  facility  and  mooring  area 
will  result  in  the  deepening  of  the  existing  river  bottom  (  lOfl.  MLLW)  by  an  average  of  4.5  ft.  over 
an  area  of  31  acres  (volume  of  150,000  cubic  yards),  and  an  area  of  61  acres,  (a  volume  of  440,000 
cubic  yards),  respectively.  The  total  area  to  be  dredged  is  92  acres  extending  nverward  1700  ft. 
from  the  shoreline.  Dredging  techniques  may  include  both  mechanical  and  hydraulic  dredging 
methods  and  the  material  removed  as  part  of  this  construction  activity  will  be  transported  to  and 
placed  in  an  on-site  or  other  approved  upland  disposal  facility. 

Increases  in  turbidity  through  the  resuspension  of  sediments  into  the  water  column  from  dredging 
and  port  operations  will  degrade  water  quality,  lower  dissolved  oxygen  levels,  and  potentially 
release  chemical  contaminants  bound  to  the  fine-grained  estuarine/marine  sediments. 

Sedimentation  and  wave  patterns  in  the  area  may  be  altered  as  a  result  of  vessels  entering  and 
exiting  the  proposed  mooring  area  also  resulting  in  increased  turbidity.  Suspended  sediments  mask 
pheromones  used  by  migratory  fishes,  and  can  smother  immobile  benthic  organisms  and  demersal 
newly-settle  juvenile  fish  (Auld  and  Schubel  1978;  Breitburg  1988;  Newcombe  and  MacDonald 
1991;  Burton  1993;  Nelson  and  Wheeler  1997).  As  supported  above,  the  project  area  provides 
important  habitat  for  striped  bass  including  valuable  spawning  grounds  and  nursery  habitat. 

Increases  in  turbidity  will  adversely  affect  striped  bass  larvae’s  ability  to  capture  prey  (Fay  et  al.' 
1983  in  Able  and  Fahay  1998).  The  decrease  in  water  circulation  can  also  adversely  affect  striped 
bass  survival  as  strong  current  is  needed  to  keep  the  eggs  suspended  in  the  water  column  and 
prevent  them  from  being  smothered  by  silt  (Bigelow  and  Schroeder  1953). 

Guidelines  under  Section  404(b)(1)  of  the  federal  Clean  Water  Act  require  that  actions  proposed 
within  "waters  of  the  United  States,"  especially  those  that  are  not  water-dependent,  are  required  to 
demonstrate  that  they  have  considered  all  appropriate  reasonable  and  prudent  measures  to  avoid  and 
minimize  impacts  to  waters.  If  all  measures  to  avoid  and  minimize  wetland  impacts  have  been 
considered  and  employed  to  the  extent  practicable  and  result  in  unavoidable  impacts,  a 
compensatory  mitigation  plan  should  be  developed  and  implemented. 

The  applicant  should  undertake  a  complete  analysis  of  alternatives  that  complies  fully  with  the 
Section  404  (b)(1)  Guidelines  that  documents  avoidance,  minimization  and  mitigation  for  all 
impacts.  Alternate  locations  as  well  as  a  documentation  of  purpose  and  need  should  be  provided  as 
part  of  this  analysis.  For  any  unavoidable  impacts,  a  compensatory  mitigation  plan  to  offset  all  of 
the  projects  impacts  to  aquatic  resources  including  EFH  should  be  developed  in  accordance  with  the 
federal  standards  and  criteria  for  compensatory  mitigation  for  losses  of  aquatic  resources  published 
in  the  Federal  Register  on  April  10,  2008  (vol.  73  No.  70).  This  plan  should  be  developed  as  early 
in  the  permit  process  as  possible  and  in  consultation  with  the  applicable  federal,  state  and  local 
resource  agencies  and  will  be  implemented  on  and  in  the  immediate  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  to  the 
extent  practicable. 

In  the  State  of  NJ,  coastal  wetlands  are  regulated  by  the  state  under  the  Wetlands  Act  of  1970. 
Development  in  coastal  wetlands  requires  authorization  of  permits  from  the  NJDEP,  and  requires

Appendix  F 


separate  processes  to  determine  a  project’s  value.  However,  such  processes  usually  fit  in  within  a 
federal  process. 

After  reasonable  measures  have  been  explored  to  avoid  and  minimize  impacts  to  wetlands,  PSEG 
will  compensate  for  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  to  wetlands  by  implementing  approved  wetland 
restoration  and/or  rehabilitation  measures.  PSEG,  through  their  Ecosystem  Enhancement  Program, 
has  extensive  experience  and  demonstrated  success  implementing  coastal  saltmarsh  and  freshwater 
wetland  restoration  and  rehabilitation  programs.  This  familiarity  with  local  wetland  systems  was 
used  to  identify  appropnate  candidate  mitigation  sites  and  will  be  used  in  developing  and 
implementing  the  final  approved  mitigation  plan. 

Mitigation  measures  mentioned  in  the  ESP  to  offset  impacts  to  NOAA  trust  resources  include  the 
following  considerations: 

•  Minimization  of  encroachment  on  coastal  wetlands 

•  Use  of  previously  developed  sediment  disposal  basins  for  plant  development  (both  PSEG's 
permitted  disposal  facility  and  the  USACE's  CDF) 

•  Refinement  of  the  Site  Utilization  Plan  to  avoid  various  wetland  areas  throughout  the  PSEG 
Site 

Opportunities  for  mitigating  unavoidable  impacts  to  wetland  ecosystems  include  restoration  of 
natural  habitats  temporarily  disturbed  by  construction,  creation  of  new  habitat  types  in  previously 
disturbed  areas,  and  enhancement  of  undisturbed  natural  habitats. 

In  general,  we  do  not  accept  the  conversion  of  one  type  of  aquatic  habitat  into  another  habitat  as 
compensatory  mitigation  when  the  existing  habitat  has  value  to  aquatic  life.  Candidate  mitigation 
areas  include  portions  of  the  existing  PSEG  Site,  Mannington  Meadow,  Mason’s  Point,  and 
additional  areas  of  the  PSEG  Alloway  Creek  Watershed  restoration  site. 

Conclusions 

My  staff  looks  forward  to  working  with  PSEG  as  you  move  forward  with  the  ESP  process.  Should 
you  have  any  questions  regarding  this  correspondence  or  would  like  to  arrange  a  meeting  to  discuss 
the  effects  of  the  proposed  action  on  NMFS  trust  resources,  please  contact  Julie  Crocker  in  the 
Protected  Resources  Division  ((978)282-8480  or  Julie.Crocker@noaa.gov)  and  Karen  Greene  in  the

Biological  Assessment  of  the  Potential  Effects  on  Federally  Listed 
Endangered  or  Threatened  Species  from  the  Proposed  Early  Site 

Permit  for  the  PSEG  Site 


1.0  INTRODUCTION 

The  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  review  team  is  reviewing  an  application 
submitted  by  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP) 
for  a  site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem 
Generating  Station  (SGS),  Units  1  and  2,  on  the  eastern  shore  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in 
Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  As  part  of  its  review  of  the  ESP 
application,  the  NRC  is  preparing  an  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  as  required  by 
Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  51 ,  the  NRC  regulations  that  implement 
the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969,  as  amended.  The  EIS  includes  an  analysis  of 
pertinent  environmental  issues,  including  endangered  and  threatened  species  and  impacts  to 
fish  and  wildlife.  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE),  Philadelphia  District,  is  a 
cooperating  agency  on  the  EIS. 

An  ESP  is  NRC  approval  of  a  site  or  sites  for  one  or  more  nuclear  power  facilities.  Issuance  of 
an  ESP  is  a  process  that  is  separate  from  the  issuance  of  a  construction  permit  (CP),  an 
operating  license  (OL),  or  a  combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (COL)  for  such 
a  facility.  The  ESP  application  and  review  process  makes  it  possible  to  evaluate  and  resolve 
safety  and  environmental  issues  related  to  siting  before  the  applicant  makes  a  large 
commitment  of  resources.  If  the  ESP  is  approved,  the  applicant  can  “bank”  the  site  for  up  to  20 
years  for  future  reactor  siting  and  can  conduct  certain  site  preparation  and  preliminary 
construction  activities  enumerated  in  10  CFR  50.10(e)(1)  (10  CFR  50-TN249).  An  ESP  does 
not,  however,  authorize  construction  and  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant.  To  construct  and 
operate  a  nuclear  power  plant,  an  ESP  holder  must  obtain  a  CP  and  an  OL,  or  a  COL,  which 
are  separate  major  Federal  actions  that  require  their  own  environmental  reviews  in  accordance 
with  10  CFR  Part  51  (10  CFR  51-TN250).  An  applicant  for  a  CP  or  COL  for  a  new  nuclear  plant 
to  be  located  at  a  site  for  which  an  ESP  has  been  issued  may  reference  the  ESP,  and  matters 
resolved  in  the  ESP  proceeding  are  considered  resolved  in  any  subsequent  proceeding  absent 
the  identification  of  new  and  significant  information. 

Upon  issuance  of  the  draft  EIS,  PSEG  plans  to  submit  a  Federal  and  a  State  application  to  the 
USACE  and  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  for  the  Alteration 
of  Any  Floodplains,  Waterways,  or  Tidal  or  Nontidal  Wetlands  in  New  Jersey.  The  USACE 
application  number,  the  NJDEP  Tidal  Application  number,  and  the  NJDEP  Nontidal  Application 
number  all  will  be  included  in  the  final  EIS.  The  final  EIS  will  be  issued  after  considering  public 
comments  on  the  draft  EIS. 

The  proposed  actions  related  to  the  PSEG  application  are  (1 )  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for  the 
PSEG  Site  (10  CFR  52-TN251 )  and  (2)  USACE  permit  action  on  a  Department  of  the  Army 
permit  application  pursuant  to  Section  404  of  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act  (Clean 
Water  Act;  33  USC  1 251 -TN662)  and  Section  1 0  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriation  Act  of 
1899  (33  USC  403-TN660).  The  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  has  the  authority 


NUREG-2168 


F.3.1-6 

F-64 


November  2015 


Appendix  F 


to  review  and  veto  USACE  decisions  on  Section  404  permits.  The  USACE  is  participating  as  a 
cooperating  agency  with  the  NRC  in  preparing  the  EIS  and  participates  collaboratively  on  the 
review  team.  The  NRC  and  USACE  have  prepared  this  biological  assessment  to  support  their 
joint  consultation  with  the  National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  in  accordance  with  Section 
7(c)  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1973,  as  amended  (ESA)  (16  USC  1531-TN1010).  The 
USACE  permit  decision  will  be  made  following  issuance  of  the  final  EIS. 

By  letter  dated  October  26,  2010  (NRC  2010-TN2203),  the  NRC  initiated  Endangered  Species 
Act  Section  7  consultation  with  NMFS  and  requested  a  list  of  endangered,  threatened, 
candidate,  and  proposed  species  as  well  as  designated  and  proposed  critical  habitat  that  may 
be  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  NMFS  provided  the  requested  information  for  marine 
species  by  letter  dated  December  9,  2010  (NMFS  2010-TN2171 ).  An  update  for  endangered, 
threatened,  candidate,  and  proposed  species  was  requested  on  July  31,  2013  (NRC  2013- 
TN2805).  NMFS  provided  updated  information  by  letter  dated  October  25,  2013  (NMFS  2013- 
TN2804).  Based  on  this  correspondence  and  review  of  electronic  sources  from  NMFS  and  the 
states  of  Delaware  and  New  Jersey,  two  fish  and  five  sea  turtle  species  were  identified  that 
occur,  or  have  the  potential  to  be  present,  in  the  site  vicinity  and  are  listed  as  either  Federally 
endangered  or  threatened;  they  are  listed  in  Table  1.

Accordingly,  this  biological  assessment  focuses  on  evaluating  the  potential  effects  from  building 
and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  adjacent  to  SGS  and  HCGS,  on  the 
Federally  listed  species  under  NMFS’s  jurisdiction  that  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

2.0  DESCRIPTION  OF  PROPOSED  ACTION 

PSEG  is  seeking  an  ESP  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  a  site  (the  PSEG  Site)  located 
adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS.  Building  activities  that  could  directly  affect  onsite  and 
offsite  aquatic  ecosystems  include  site  preparation  for  installation  of  plant  structures  and  cooling 
towers,  switchyards,  temporary  laydown  area,  improvements  to  the  HCGS  barge  slip,  building 
the  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility,  installing  the  cooling  water  system  intake  and 
discharge  structures,  and  building  the  proposed  5-mi  causeway.

2.1  Site  Location  and  Description 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Artificial  Island  was  formed  from  dredge  spoils 
produced  as  a  result  of  maintenance  dredging  of  the  Delaware  River  navigation  channel  by  the 
USACE.  The  site  is  approximately  7  mi  east  of  Middletown,  Delaware;  7.5  mi  southwest  of 
Salem,  New  Jersey;  and  9  mi  south  of  Pennsville,  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Figure  1 
shows  the  location  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  areas  within  a  6-mi  (1 0-km)  radius  and  50-mi  (80- 
km)  radius  of  the  facility. 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  HCGS  and  SGS  on  the  northwestern  portion  of  the 
existing  PSEG  property.  Figure  2  depicts  the  PSEG  Site  in  relation  to  the  existing  units  and 
nearby  water  bodies.  PSEG  owns  734  ac  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  is  developing  an  agreement 
with  the  USACE  to  acquire  85  ac  immediately  north  of  the  site.  Thus,  the  total  PSEG  Site  would 
encompass  819  ac.  Figure  3  provides  aerial  plan  view  of  the  proposed  site  layout  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  region  within  1 5  mi  (24  km)  of  the  site  is  used  primarily  for  agriculture.  The  area  also 
includes  numerous  parks,  wildlife  refuges,  and  preserves  such  as  Mad  Horse  Creek  Wildlife 
Management  Area  (WMA)  to  the  east;  Cedar  Swamp  State  WMA  to  the  south  in  Delaware; 
Appoquinimink,  Silver  Run,  and  Augustine  State  WMAs  to  the  west  in  Delaware;  and  Supawna 
Meadows  National  Wildlife  Refuge  to  the  north  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2.1.1  Delaware  River  Estuary 

The  Delaware  River  and  Delaware  Bay  are  a  part  of  the  larger  Delaware  Estuary  and  River 
Basin  that  extends  from  headwaters  in  New  York  to  the  coastal  plains  near  Cape  Henlopen  in 
Delaware  (PDE  201 2-TN21 91 ).  The  Delaware  Bay  extends  from  the  confluence  of  the 
Delaware  River  with  the  Atlantic  Ocean  from  Delaware  River  Mile  (RM)  0  to  RM  54  (River 
Kilometer  [RKM]  0  to  RKM  86.9).  The  Delaware  River  Estuary  includes  the  Delaware  Bay  and 
extends  up  the  tidal  Delaware  River,  which  is  characterized  by  brackish  water  between 
Delaware  RM  54  and  RM  80  (RKM  86.9  and  RKM  128.8)  and  becomes  freshwater  at  Delaware 
RM  80  (BBL  and  Integral  2007-TN2126).  The  PSEG  Site  near  the  mouth  of  Alloway  Creek  is  at 
Delaware  RM  52  (DRBC  201 1-TN2412)  and  is  considered  to  be  in  the  lower  estuary  watershed 
unit  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  (PDE  2012-TN2191 ). 

Characterization  of  the  region  dates  back  to  pre-Revolutionary  War  times  when  shipping  and 
trading  at  developing  ports  from  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  to  inland  Delaware, 
Pennsylvania,  and  New  Jersey  increased  use  of  the  watershed  (Berger  et  al.  1994-TN2127). 
Increasing  urbanization  and  industrialization  of  the  region  from  1840  to  present  day  have 
significantly  contributed  to  the  degradation  of  the  watershed  with  habitat  alteration,  water 
diversion,  and  increased  pollution  of  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin  ecosystems 
because  no  environmental  policies  were  established  until  the  1960s  and  later  (Berger  et 
al.  1994-TN2127).

Appendix  F 


According  to  the  most  recent  status  report  on  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin,  the  region 
continues  to  see  some  decline  in  environmental  health  indicators  such  as  removal  of  estuary 
sediments  and  increases  in  nitrogen  and  contaminant  levels.  However,  environmental 
conditions  such  as  technology  implementation  to  increase  fish  passage  and  restoration  of 
targeted  aquatic  habitats  have  improved  the  aquatic  ecology  for  the  watershed  (PDE  2012- 
TN2191).  The  Delaware  River  Basin  Commission  (DRBC)  stated  in  the  State  of  the  Delaware 
River  Basin  report  for  2013  that  increases  in  temperature  and  salinity  are  expected  with  future 
sea-level  rise  and  climate  change  (DRBC  2013-TN2609).  These  potential  changes  are  likely  to 
result  in  movement  of  populations  of  more  marine  and  euryhaline  species  further  up  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary. 

The  boundary  of  salinity  intrusion  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  also  known  as  the  salt  line, 
fluctuates  with  flow  changes.  The  salt  line  moves  in  response  to  the  tides  and  variations  in 
Delaware  River  Estuary  freshwater  discharge.  During  most  of  the  year,  the  salt  line  is  located 
between  the  Commodore  Barry  Bridge  at  Delaware  RM  82  (RKM  132)  and  Reedy  Island  at 
Delaware  RM  54  (RKM  86.9)  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  During  the  drought  of  record  in  the  1960s, 
the  salt  line  moved  to  its  most  upstream  historically  observed  location  at  Delaware  RM  102 
(DRBC  2008-TN2277).  Salinity  is  an  important  determinant  of  biotic  distribution  in  estuaries, 
and  salinity  near  the  PSEG  Site  varies  with  river  flow.  Salinity  measurements  taken  over  a 
number  of  years  between  RM  51  and  RM  49  report  a  minimum  salinity  of  0.1  parts  per  thousand 
(ppt)  and  a  maximum  of  17.9  ppt  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

At  the  PSEG  Site  on  Artificial  Island,  the  estuary  is  tidal  with  a  net  flow  to  the  south.  The 
USACE  maintains  a  dredged  navigation  channel  near  the  center  of  the  estuary  about  6,600  ft 
(2,000  m)  west  of  the  shoreline  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  navigation  channel  is  about  40  ft  (1 2  m) 
deep  and  1,300  ft  (400  m)  wide;  however,  starting  in  2010,  the  USACE  began  implementing  the 
Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  to  deepen  the  existing  navigation  channel 
from  40  to  45  ft  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  On  the  New  Jersey  side  of  the  channel,  water  depths 
in  the  open  estuary  at  mean  low  water  are  fairly  uniform  at  about  20  ft  (6  m).  Predominant  tides 
in  the  area  are  semi-diurnal,  with  a  period  of  approximately  12  hours  and  a  mean  tidal  range  of 
5.3  ft  (1.6  m)  at  RM  52  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

The  biological  communities  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  are 
typical  of  those  that  exist  all  along  the  main  reaches  of  the  Delaware  Bay  system.  To  mitigate 
egg  and  larval  fish  loss  through  the  cooling  system  for  SGS,  PSEG  proposed  and  established 
an  estuary  enhancement  program  (EEP)  to  restore  salt  marshes  and  provide  monitoring  and 
other  structural  enhancements  to  mitigate  losses  of  aquatic  species  through  impingement  and 
entrainment  at  SGS  (Balletto  and  Teal  201 1-TN2612). 

The  PSEG  EEP  was  established  in  1995  as  part  of  New  Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination 
System  (NJPDES)  requirements  for  SGS  and  includes  an  ongoing  biological  monitoring 
program  in  addition  to  habitat  restoration  to  track  the  success  of  the  mitigation  actions. 

Because  of  the  biological  monitoring  surveys  that  have  been  conducted  in  this  area  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  since  the  mid-1980s  in  support  of  environmental  requirements  for  the 
construction  and  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  an  extensive  long-term  data  set  exists  on  the 
fishery  and  benthic  macroinvertebrate  communities  of  this  area.

Submerged  aquatic  vegetation  has  not  historically  been  observed  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
primarily  because  of  the  high  levels  of  turbidity  (Miller  et  al.  201 2-TN2686),  and  there  is  little  to 
no  submerged  aquatic  vegetation  observed  in  the  sampling  areas  near  the  PSEG  Site 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Phytoplankton  and  zooplankton  studies  between  1973  and  1976 
identified  over  100  genera  of  phytoplankton  in  the  area  of  the  site,  with  three  diatom  taxa 
dominating  the  phytoplankton  community:  Skeletonema  costatum ,  Melosira  spp.,  and 
Chaetoceros  spp.  (IAI  1980-TN2608).  The  primary  production  contributed  by  the  phytoplankton 
community  is  highest  during  the  warmer  months  and  lowest  during  the  winter.  Because 
estuarine  systems  are  typically  characterized  by  a  shallow  euphotic  zone  and  high  turbidity, 
contribution  of  organic  carbon  to  the  base  of  the  food  web  by  phytoplankton  production  is 
relatively  small  compared  to  that  supplied  by  organic  detritus  and  other  primary  producers  such 
as  benthic  algae,  periphyton,  and  submergent  and  emergent  macrophytes  (IAI  1980-TN2608). 
Surveys  of  zooplankton  communities  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  site  have  identified 
over  100  taxa  of  microzooplankton  (IAI  1980-TN2608).  Dominant  taxa  consisted  of  rotifers  and 
copepods  (largely  nauplii).  Macroinvertebrate  plankton  samples  were  composed  of  46  taxa 
(32  arthropods),  with  the  dominant  groups  being  amphipods  Gammarus  spp.,  the  mysid  shrimp 
Neomysis  americana ,  larvae  of  the  crabs  Rhithropanopeus  harrisii  and  Uca  minax ,  and  the 
isopod  Chiridotea  almyra.  Seasonal  variations  in  total  density  of  zooplankton  were  not  as 
consistent  as  that  observed  for  the  phytoplankton  community  and  were  generally  related  to 
short-lived  differential  abundances  of  a  few  dominant  taxa  (IAI  1980-TN2608). 

The  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  a  complex  ecosystem  with  many  species  playing  different  roles 
throughout  their  life  cycles.  Major  assemblages  of  organisms  within  the  estuarine  community 
include  plankton,  benthic  invertebrates,  and  fish.  Detailed  descriptions  of  these  assemblages 
can  be  found  in  Section  2. 4. 2. 3  of  the  EIS  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

2.2  Dredging  and  In-Water  Installation  Activities 

Before  initiating  any  site  preparation  or  development  activities,  PSEG  would  be  required  to 
obtain  the  appropriate  authorizations  regulating  alterations  to  waters  of  the  United  States, 
including  ponds  and  creeks.  Building  activities  that  could  directly  affect  onsite  and  offsite 
aquatic  ecosystems  include  site  preparation  for  installing  plant  structures  and  cooling  towers, 
switchyards,  and  the  temporary  laydown  area;  making  improvements  to  the  HCGS  barge  slip; 
building  the  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility;  installing  the  cooling  water  system  intake 
and  discharge  structures;  and  building  the  proposed  causeway.  Aquatic  habitats  potentially 
affected  include  the  onsite  artificial  ponds  and  small  marsh  creeks,  habitats  associated  with  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary,  and  the  interconnected  system  of  tidal  wetlands  and  marsh  creeks 
primarily  north  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Potential  direct  impacts  on  aquatic  resources  as  a  result  of 
building  activities  would  involve  physical  alteration  of  habitat  (e.g.,  infilling,  cofferdam 
placement,  dredging,  pile  driving)  including  temporary  or  permanent  removal  of  associated 
benthic  organisms,  sedimentation,  changes  in  hydrological  regimes,  and  changes  in  water 
quality.  Potential  indirect  impacts  include  increased  runoff  from  impervious  surfaces  and 
subsequent  erosion,  as  well  as  sedimentation  and  isolation  of  marsh  creek  segments  due  to 
infilling  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Installation  activities  with  the  potential  to  affect  the  aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  include  improvements  to  and  use  of  the  existing  HCGS  barge  slip,  a  new  barge  storage

Appendix  F 


area  and  unloading  facility,  an  adjacent  heavy  haul  road,  the  intake  and  discharge  structures 
along  the  eastern  shore  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  (Figure  3),  and  installation  of  a 
causeway  extending  from  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  to  the  north  (Figure  2).  Shoreline 
installation  and  site  preparation  activities  would  require  a  stormwater  pollution  prevention  plan 
(SWPPP),  developed  as  part  of  the  NJPDES  stormwater  permit,  which  would  describe  best 
management  practices  (BMPs)  to  control  sedimentation  and  erosion  and  provide  stormwater 
management.  Shoreline  structures  would  be  hardened  to  protect  from  shoreline  erosion  using 
placement  of  concrete  or  riprap  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Improvements  to  the  HCGS  barge  slip  would  include  deepening  the  existing  barge  slip  by 
another  2  ft  to  accommodate  equipment-carrying  barges  (Cook  2009-TN2713).  An  estimated 
1 ,350  yd3  of  dredged  material  would  be  removed  within  the  existing  HCGS  barge  slip  to  allow 
for  additional  clearance  of  barges  carrying  equipment  that  can  be  delivered  to  the  PSEG  Site.  If 
the  final  plant  designs  indicate  modules  larger  than  54  ft  in  width  are  required,  the  existing  60  ft- 
wide  HCGS  barge  slip  may  be  widened  an  additional  20  ft  along  the  south  side  of  the  barge  slip 
and  dredged  an  additional  2  ft  below  current  barge  slip  depth.  A  double  row  of  sheet  piling 
would  need  to  be  placed  before  removal  of  excess  earth  by  dredging.  An  estimated  5,800  yd3 
of  material  would  be  removed,  and  the  existing  riprap  at  the  front  end  of  the  slip  would  be 
removed  and  then  replaced  at  the  widened  river  end  of  the  slip  (Cook  2009-TN27 1 3). 

The  new  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  would  require  dredging  about  440,000  yd3  of 
sediment  to  lower  the  river  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  61  ac  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  An  additional 
0.05  ac  of  river  bottom  habitat  would  be  removed  for  installation  of  seven  20-ft-diameter  barge 
mooring  caissons.  Installation  of  a  new  intake  structure  would  require  dredging  of  about 
150,000  yd3  of  sediment  to  lower  the  river  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  31  ac  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 
Dredging  would  also  be  required  for  installation  of  a  new  discharge  structure;  however,  specific 
details  on  the  amount  of  material  to  be  dredged  for  discharge  structure  placement  likely  would 
depend  on  final  design  and  placement  criteria.  Dredged  material  disposal  would  be  either  on 
the  site  or  in  another  approved  upland  disposal  facility  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

The  installation  of  the  barge  storage  and  unloading  facilities  as  well  as  the  intake  and  discharge 
structures  would  result  in  temporary  disturbances  to  the  aquatic  habitat  in  those  portions  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary.  An  increase  in  suspended  sediments  could  occur  during  dredging 
activities;  however,  PSEG  would  comply  with  NJDEP  and  USACE  permitting  regulations 
regarding  type  of  dredge  used,  timing  and  duration  of  dredging,  and  appropriate  BMPs  to 
minimize  sedimentation  effects  as  required  for  Federal  and  State  permitting.  Motile 
invertebrates,  fish,  and  sea  turtles  might  swim  into  this  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary, 
but  they  would  be  able  to  swim  away  or  likely  would  avoid  the  area  because  of  vibratory  noise 
from  pile-driving  activities.  Mobile  macroinvertebrates  in  this  area  might  be  able  to  occupy 
adjacent  habitat  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  as  the  species  composition  and  abundance  of 
the  macroinvertebrate  community  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  site  are  similar  to 
those  of  benthic  communities  in  adjacent  benthic  areas  of  southern  portion  of  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary.  Although  permanent  alteration  of  at  least  92  ac  of  river  bottom  habitat  would 
occur,  the  impacts  to  aquatic  communities  in  the  vicinity  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Offsite,  an  estimated  2,123  linear  ft  of  marsh  creek  channels  would  be  crossed  by  the  proposed 
causeway  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Installation  of  the  elevated  causeway  would  require 


NUREG-21 68

Appendix  F 


permanent  pier  placement  for  support  structures.  However,  PSEG  plans  to  avoid  placement  in 
stream  channels  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Runoff  from  disturbed  areas  would  be  temporary  and 
controlled  through  the  use  of  BMPs  required  for  water  quality  in  compliance  with  Federal  and 
New  Jersey  permitting,  and  runoff  is  not  expected  to  adversely  affect  Delaware  River  Estuary 
surface  waters  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Vessel  use  during  the  dredging  or  installation  of  the  in-water  structures  and  transportation  of 
large  system  components  to  the  PSEG  Site  may  affect  the  aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary,  particularly  the  benthos.  The  main  impacts  of  using  vessels  would  include 
turbulence  from  propellers  (prop  wash)  and  accidental  spills  of  materials  overboard.  Vessels 
would  be  used  during  installation  of  the  cooling  water  discharge  pipeline  and  during  offloading  of 
materials  from  barges  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Vessel  operation  during  building  or  operation 
activities  may  cause  short-term,  localized  impacts  on  aquatic  species  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary.  These  impacts  should  not  affect  the  general  resources  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  or 
the  region  along  this  coast  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

2.3  Cooling  Water  System  Description  and  Operation 

All  cooling  water  for  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be 
withdrawn  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  and  impacts  associated  with  operation  of  the  water 
intake  system  would  be  limited  to  aquatic  resources  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  For 
aquatic  resources,  the  primary  concerns  are  related  to  the  amount  of  water  withdrawn  and  the 
amount  of  water  consumed  through  evaporation  and  the  potential  for  organisms  to  be  impinged 
on  the  intake  screens  or  entrained  into  the  cooling  water  system.  Impingement  occurs  when 
aquatic  organisms  are  drawn  into  the  cooling  water  intake  and  are  trapped  against  the  intake 
screens  by  the  force  of  the  water  passing  through  the  cooling  water  intake  structure  (66  FR 
65256-TN243).  Impingement  can  result  in  starvation,  exhaustion,  asphyxiation,  descaling  of 
fish,  and  other  physical  injuries  (66  FR  65256-TN243).  Entrainment  occurs  when  aquatic 
organisms  drawn  into  the  intake  structure  are  small  enough  to  pass  through  the  intake  screens 
and  the  cooling  system.  Entrained  organisms  are  usually  passively  drifting  forms  (plankton)  or 
small,  weakly  swimming  early  life  stages  offish  and  shellfish  (66  FR  65256-TN243).  As 
entrained  organisms  pass  through  the  cooling  system  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site,  they  would  be  subjected  to  mechanical,  thermal,  pressure,  and  chemical  stresses. 

A  number  of  factors,  such  as  the  type  of  cooling  system,  the  design  and  location  of  the  intake 
structure,  and  the  amount  of  water  withdrawn  from  the  source  water  body  greatly  influence  the 
degree  to  which  impingement  and  entrainment  affect  aquatic  biota.  Impingement  and 
entrainment  impacts  are  regulated  by  EPA  or  its  designees  (in  this  case,  the  NJDEP)  under 
316(b)  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  (33  USC  1251-TN662).  Section  316(b)  “requires  that  the 
location,  design,  construction,  and  capacity  of  cooling  water  intake  structures  reflect  the  best 
technology  available  for  minimizing  adverse  environmental  impact.”  A  new  nuclear  power  plant 
at  the  PSEG  Site  would  employ  closed-cycle  cooling.  Depending  on  the  quality  of  the  makeup 
water,  closed-cycle,  recirculating  cooling  water  systems  can  reduce  water  use  by  96  to 
98  percent  of  the  amount  that  the  facility  would  use  if  it  employed  a  once-through  cooling 
system  (66  FR  65256-TN243).  This  significant  reduction  in  the  water  withdrawal  rate  results  in 
a  corresponding  reduction  in  impingement  and  entrainment  losses. 


November  2015 


F. 3. 1-15 


NUREG-2168 


F-73 


Appendix  F 


The  intake  design  through-screen  velocity  is  another  factor  that  greatly  influences  the  rate  of 
impingement  of  fish  and  shellfish  at  a  facility.  In  general,  the  higher  the  through-screen  velocity, 
the  greater  the  number  of  fish  impinged.  The  EPA  has  established  a  national  standard  for  the 
maximum  design  through-screen  velocity  of  no  more  than  0.5  feet  per  second  (fps)  (66  FR 
65256-TN243).  The  EPA  determined  that  species  and  life  stages  evaluated  in  various  studies 
could  endure  a  velocity  of  1 .0  fps;  they  then  applied  a  safety  factor  of  2  to  drive  the  threshold  of 
0.5  fps.  PSEG  has  stated  that  the  proposed  intake  structure  would  be  located  flush  with  the 
east  shoreline  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  would  be  designed  to  have  a  through-screen 
velocity  of  less  than  0.5  fps  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  The  resulting  low  through-screen  velocity 
would  reduce  the  probability  of  impingement  because  most  fish  can  swim  against  such  low 
flows  to  avoid  the  intake  screens.  The  fish  protection  system,  including  the  traveling  screens 
and  fish  return,  would  be  designed  and  operated  to  comply  with  the  NJPDES  permit  that  would 
be  issued  for  the  cooling  system  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Another  factor  affecting  impingement  and  entrainment  losses  is  the  percentage  of  the  flow  of  the 
source  water  body  past  the  site  that  is  withdrawn  by  the  station.  To  minimize  impacts,  the  EPA 
determined  that  for  estuaries  or  tidal  rivers,  intake  flow  must  be  less  than  or  equal  to  one 
percent  of  the  tidal  excursion  (one  tidal  cycle  of  flood  and  ebb)  volume  (66  FR  65256-TN243). 
Makeup  water  for  the  cooling  system  would  be  drawn  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  at  an 
average  rate  of  78,196  gallons  per  minute  (gpm)  (174  cubic  feet  per  second  [cfs]),  with 
consumptive  use  at  a  rate  of  26,420  gpm  (59  cfs)  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Tidal  flows  near  the 
PSEG  Site  average  400,000  to  472,000  cfs,  and  the  freshwater  flow  from  the  Delaware  River 
and  its  tributaries  averages  20,240  cfs.  Therefore,  the  makeup  water  use  rate  is  less  than  0.05 
percent  of  the  average  flow  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452). 

2.3. 7.7  Impingement 

Because  of  its  location  on  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  impinge  a  variety  of  freshwater  and  marine  fish  and  shellfish.  Data  from  the 
impingement  studies  for  SGS  (once-through  cooling)  indicate  that  50  to  67  finfish  species  are 
impinged  each  year  compared  to  just  under  50  species  of  finfish  impinged  at  HCGS  (closed- 
cycle  cooling)  between  1986  and  1987.  However,  the  number  of  sampling  events  differed 
dramatically  between  the  two  plants  with  only  46  to  48  sampling  events  at  HCGS  over  the  same 
years  (1986-87)  as  the  more  than  530  sampling  events  per  year  at  SGS  (VJSA  1988-TN2564; 
ECS  1989-TN2572).  The  species  composition  in  the  screen  samples  also  varied  between  SGS 
and  HCGS  during  the  1986  to  1987  sampling  and  varied  at  SGS  between  the  sampling  dates  in 
the  1980s  and  sampling  dates  since  2003.  Table  2  compares  important,  most  abundant,  and 
total  finfish  species,  as  well  as  blue  crab  ( Callinectes  sapidus)  impinged  at  SGS  and  HCGS 
between  1986  and  1987  and  at  SGS  between  2003  and  2010.

Within  the  1986  to  1987  sampling  years,  species  composition  differed  between  SGS  and 
HCGS.  Many  of  the  abundant  or  important  species  impinged  at  SGS  were  either  not  as 
abundant  at  HCGS  at  similar  densities  or  were  noticeably  more  abundant  at  HCGS  than  at 
SGS.  Species  that  shared  similar  densities  included  blue  crab,  American  Eel  ( Anguilla  rostrata), 
Bay  Anchovy  ( Anchoa  mitchilli),  and  Atlantic  Silverside  ( Menidia  menidia).  Total  density  of 
impinged  fish  at  both  SGS  and  HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  was  comparable  and  was 
calculated  using  the  number  of  a  given  species  collected  per  million  cubic  meters  of  intake 
water  volume  sampled. 

Differences  in  impinged  species  composition  between  SGS  and  HCGS  may  be  attributable  to 
the  different  physical  locations  of  the  intake  structures  of  the  two  existing  sites  (i.e. ,  southwest 
for  the  SGS  cooling  water  intake  structure  versus  west  for  the  HCGS  service  water  intake 
structure)  and  differences  in  intake  screening  technology  and  screen  approach  velocities 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

The  comparison  of  the  SGS  1986-87  impingement  data  with  SGS  2003-10  impingement  data 
shows  shifts  in  specific  species  abundance.  Calculating  mean  density  impinged  per  volume  of 
water  corrects  for  the  difference  in  number  of  sampling  events  as  more  frequent  samples  were 
collected  between  2003  and  2010.  Interestingly,  the  total  abundance  of  blue  crab,  Bay 
Anchovy,  Summer  Flounder  ( Paralichthys  dentatus ),  Oyster  Toadfish  ( Opsanus  tau ),  and 
Hogchoker  ( Trinectes  maculatus)  diminished  by  a  factor  of  2  or  more  since  the  1986-87 
sampling  events.  However,  increases  in  Atlantic  Silverside,  White  Perch  ( Morone  americana), 
Striped  Bass  ( Morone  saxatilis ),  Atlantic  Croaker  ( Micropogonias  undulatus),  American  Shad 
(. Alosa  sapidissima ),  Channel  Catfish  (Ictalurus  punctatus),  Northern  Kingfish  ( Menticirrhus 
saxatilis ),  and  Gizzard  Shad  ( Dorosoma  cepedianum )  are  evident  since  the  1986-87  sampling. 
Of  note,  impingement  data  for  SGS  from  2008  to  2010  (PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010- 
TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 )  were  also  examined  and  compared  with  SGS  impingement  data 
from  2003  to  2007  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG 
2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569)  to  assess  any  recent  deviation  from  the  previous  2003  to 
2007  trend  (data  not  shown  in  table).  Gizzard  Shad,  Northern  Kingfish,  Black  Drum  ( Pogonias 
cromis),  and  Atlantic  Menhaden  ( Brevoortia  tyrannus)  all  increased  by  a  factor  of  2  in  the  more 
recent  sampling.  However,  Blueback  Herring  ( Alosa  aestivalis ),  Atlantic  Croaker,  Butterfish 
( Peprilus  triacanthus ),  Channel  Catfish,  Scup  ( Stenotomus  chrysops),  and  Spotted  Hake 
( Urophycis  regia)  were  all  reduced  by  a  factor  of  2  in  the  more  recent  sampling.  These 
deviations  in  annual  averages  may  represent  changes  to  environmental  conditions  at  the  larger 
regional  scale,  such  as  climate,  seasonal  weather  extremes,  and  fishing  pressure,  and  do  not 
appear  to  reflect  any  longer  term  trends  in  abundance. 

Impingement  mortality  was  not  reported  during  the  HCGS  impingement  sampling  in  1986  or 
1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572).  However,  sampling  at  SGS  between  1986  and 
1987  and  between  2003  and  2010  reported  between  97  percent  and  100  percent  live, 
undamaged  blue  crab,  and  live  condition  for  greater  than  50  percent  of  the  finfish  impinged  with 
the  exception  of  White  Perch  and  Atlantic  Croaker  juveniles  between  1986  and  1987 
(VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572;  PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG

TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).

Historical  impingement  rates  for  the  aquatic  community  from  SGS  (2003  to  2010)  and  HCGS 
(1986  to  1987)  were  used  to  estimate  potential  impingement  losses  associated  with  the 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005- 
TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009- 
TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ;  VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572). 
HCGS  is  more  similar  to  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  with  a  closed-cycle 
cooling  system  design,  versus  the  once-through  cooling  system  of  SGS.  SGS  withdraws  larger 
volumes  of  water  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  with  a  faster  through-screen  velocity  (roughly 
0.9  fps),  and  therefore,  SGS  would  be  expected  to  impinge  more  fish  than  the  closed-cycle 
cooling  systems  of  HCGS  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

PSEG  examined  the  most  recent  HCGS  impingement  data  from  1986  and  1987  with  same  year 
impingement  data  for  SGS  and  derived  a  correction  factor  by  dividing  the  HCGS  data  by  the 
SGS  data  to  allow  comparison  between  the  two  plants  and  normalize  the  differences  in  intake 
volume  and  velocity  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572).  Examination  of  1986  to  1987 
density  impingement  rates  for  finfish  show  a  total  impingement  density  average  of  2,095.4 
organisms  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  for  HCGS  and  2,643.6  organisms  per  million  m3 
total  water  volume  for  SGS.  When  combining  both  finfish  and  blue  crab  impingement  rates, 
HCGS  has  a  total  impingement  density  average  of  4,545.5  organisms  per  million  m3  total  water 
volume,  and  SGS  has  a  total  impingement  density  average  of  4,189.1  organisms  per  million  m3 
total  water  volume.  The  more  recent  impingement  rates  for  SGS  between  2003  and  2010  report 
a  finfish  impingement  rate  of  3,152.5  organisms  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  and  a 
combined  blue  crab  and  finfish  impingement  rate  of  3,842.9  organisms  per  million  m3  total  water 
volume.  Therefore,  a  correction  factor  may  not  be  needed  to  assess  total  organism 
impingement,  and  PSEG  used  a  conservative  approach  in  its  environmental  report  for 
assessing  potential  impingement  rates  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  However,  for 
comparative  purposes,  PSEG  presented  in  its  environmental  report  both  the  conservative 
assumption  and  the  correction  factor  for  estimating  potential  impingement  rates  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452). 

Sampled  total  finfish  density  was  moderately  lower  at  HCGS  relative  to  SGS  using  data  sets 
either  from  1 986  to  1 987  or  from  2003  to  201 0,  possibly  because  of  the  lower  approach 
velocities  to  the  HCGS  screens.  The  only  commercially  important  invertebrate  vulnerable  to 
substantial  impingement  by  the  intake  structure  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
is  the  blue  crab.  Blue  crab  densities  for  impingement  samples  at  SGS  were  690.4  per  million  m3 
total  water  volume  between  2003  and  2010  and  1 ,542.5  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  in 
1986  to  1987.  At  HCGS,  blue  crabs  were  impinged  at  a  mean  rate  of  2,450.1  per  million  m3 
total  water  volume  in  1986  to  1987  (see  Table  2).  It  is  possible  that  the  rate  of  impingement  at  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  blue  crab  may  be  less  than  in  1986  to  1987 
because  there  was  a  significant  drop  in  impingement  abundance  of  blue  crab  at  SGS  between 
the  sampling  dates  in  the  1980s  and  the  average  of  8  years  of  more  recent  sampling. 

The  applicant  estimated  impingement  rates  of  finfish  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  by  multiplying  the  more  recent  SGS  impingement  densities  by  a  correction  factor 
representing  the  ratio  of  the  total  finfish  impingement  density  at  HCGS  (1986  to  1987)  to  that  of 
SGS  for  the  same  period.  Recent  examination  of  these  data  sets  and  impingement  rates 
derives  the  correction  factor  to  be  0.79  (2,095.4/2,643.6).  It  is  reasonable  to  use  the  historical

Appendix  F 


HCGS  impingement  rate  correction  factor  for  the  estimate  of  impingement  rate  at  a  new  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  because  the  intake  design  velocity  for  a  new  plant  (less  than  0.5  fps)  is  more 
comparable  to  HCGS  than  to  SGS  (roughly  0.9  fps).  Thus,  the  estimated  total  impingement  rate 
of  finfish  due  to  operation  of  a  new  plant  is  2,490.5  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  compared 
to  the  more  recent  impingement  rate  of  3,1 52.5  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  for  SGS. 

White  Perch,  Atlantic  Croaker,  and  Weakfish  ( Cynoscion  regalis)  are  expected  to  comprise  the 
majority  of  the  impingement  total.  The  proposed  maximum  rate  of  water  withdrawal  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  equivalent  to  3.7  percent  of  the  intake  flow  at  SGS 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Assuming  a  constant  withdrawal  of  78,196  gpm  for  a  new  plant,  and 
using  the  79  percent  correction  factor  for  finfish  impingement,  a  new  plant  would  result  in 
impingement  of  an  estimated  386,526  fish  annually.  Using  the  conservative  assumption  with  no 
correction  factor,  and  a  maximum  rate  of  water  withdrawal  for  a  new  plant  of  3.7  percent  of  the 
intake  flow  of  SGS,  approximately  489,148  fish  would  be  impinged  annually  at  a  new  plant  at 
the  PSEG  site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

The  intake  structure  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  contain  traveling 
screens  to  collect  debris  and  fish.  Impinged  organic  debris  and  aquatic  organisms  would  be 
washed  from  the  traveling  screens  and  returned  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Mixed  organic 
and  manmade  debris  (e.g.,  wood,  plastic)  collected  from  the  trash  racks  would  be  disposed  of 
offsite. 

Details  about  the  screen  design,  screen  wash,  and  fish  return  system  for  a  new  plant  are  not 
available,  but  PSEG  has  stated  in  its  environmental  report  that  the  screen  design  would  be 
compliant  with  EPA  316(b)  Phase  I  requirements  specified  in  40  CFR  125.84  (40  CFR  1 25- 
TN254),  would  be  similar  to  screens  at  HCGS,  and  would  include  low-pressure  screen  washes 
to  safely  remove  impinged  organisms  and  water-filled  fish  buckets  to  improve  the  survival  of 
screen-washed  fish  and  shellfish  until  they  are  transported  back  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
by  the  fish  return  system  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

In  terms  of  numbers,  the  estimated  impingement  of  most  fish  species  is  a  small  percentage  of 
the  commercial  and  recreational  harvests  of  these  species  in  Delaware  and  New  Jersey  as 
described  in  Section  2.4.2.  Blue  crab,  Weakfish,  White  Perch,  and  Atlantic  Croaker  potentially 
would  have  the  highest  impingement  rates  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 
However,  it  is  expected  that  a  large  portion  of  these  impinged  organisms  would  survive  because 
of  the  comparable  impingement  mortality  recorded  for  SGS  with  a  higher  through-screen 
velocity  than  would  be  used  for  a  new  plant.  Based  on  the  planned  low  through-screen  intake 
velocity  and  the  use  of  closed-cycle  cooling,  the  review  team  concludes  that  impacts  from 
impingement  of  aquatic  organisms  at  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  minor. 

2. 3. 1.2  Entrainment 

Small,  passively  drifting,  or  weakly  swimming  aquatic  organisms  that  are  drawn  into  the  intake 
and  pass  through  the  openings  in  the  traveling  screens  would  be  killed  by  passage  through  the 
closed-cycle  cooling  system.  Some  entrained  organisms  are  present  year-round,  such  as 
phytoplankton  and  many  types  of  zooplankton.  These  diverse  plant  and  animal  species  (often 
referred  to  as  holoplankton)  are  abundant  throughout  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  have 
short  generation  times,  so  they  can  rapidly  replace  losses  due  to  entrainment,  heat  shock,  and 
other  stresses.  Other  entrained  organisms,  such  as  the  larval  stages  of  fish,  crabs,  and  other 


NUREG-21 68

Appendix  F 


bottom-dwelling  crustaceans,  are  present  only  seasonally  near  the  proposed  intake  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  many  of  these  seasonally  planktonic 
organisms  (collectively  referred  to  as  meroplankton)  have  longer  life  spans  and  generation 
times,  so  losses  from  cooling  system  effects  are  not  as  readily  replaced. 

The  history  of  entrainment  sampling  at  SGS  and  analyses  of  entrainment  losses  are  described 
in  the  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants — 
Supplement  45:  Regarding  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Nuclear  Generating 
Station,  Units  1  and  2  Final  Report  (NRC  201 1 -TN31 31 ).  Most  recently,  entrainment  of  fish 
eggs,  larvae,  juveniles,  and  adults  in  the  SGS  cooling  water  system  was  studied  between  2003 
and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN257 1 ).  Over  the  8-year  period,  between  25  and  38  species  were  identified  each  year  among 
the  entrained  fish  (eggs,  larvae,  small  juveniles,  and  adults).  Of  these,  92  percent  of  the 
entrainment  samples  were  composed  of  two  species:  Bay  Anchovy  (75.3  percent)  and  Naked 
Goby  (Gobiosoma  bosc)  (16.7  percent).  Additional  species  that  comprised  over  98  percent  of 
all  entrained  species  included  Atlantic  Croaker  (3.5  percent),  Striped  Bass  (1.4  percent), 
Weakfish  (0.8  percent),  Atlantic  Menhaden  (0.4  percent),  and  Atlantic  Silverside  (0.4  percent). 
Bay  Anchovy  was  the  most  abundantly  entrained  species  for  the  egg  (99.7  percent)  and  adult 
(57  percent)  life  stages,  while  Naked  Goby  was  the  most  abundantly  entrained  larval  species 
(49  percent),  and  Atlantic  Croaker  was  the  most  abundantly  of  entrained  juvenile  species  (56 
percent)  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN2571 ).  Seasonal  vulnerability  to  entrainment  is  species-specific.  For  example,  eggs,  larvae, 
and  juveniles  of  Bay  Anchovy  were  most  numerous  in  entrainment  samples  in  summer  months 
(June  and  July),  whereas  Atlantic  Croaker  juveniles  were  most  abundant  in  the  fall  (October  and 
November)  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN2571 ).  In  general,  the  densities  of  entrained  individuals  for  most  fish  species  were  greatest 
in  the  spring  and/or  summer,  corresponding  to  the  spawning  periods  for  these  species.  Total 
densities  of  all  fish  life  stages  in  the  entrainment  samples  ranged  from  54.0/100  m3  (2003)  to 
264.2/100  m3  (2007)  and  averaged  125.0/100  m3  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

PSEG  applied  estimated  annual  entrainment  rates  from  SGS  directly  to  calculate  entrainment 
rates  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  entrainment  rates  at  SGS  were 
applied  to  a  new  plant  without  a  correction  factor  because  entrained  organisms  are  planktonic. 
Entrainment  rates  are  a  function  of  water  withdrawal  rates  and  are  not  influenced  by  through- 
screen  velocities.  Entrainment  rates  of  holoplankton  and  meroplankton  would  be  much  smaller 
for  a  new  plant  than  for  SGS  because  of  the  smaller  volume  of  water  withdrawn  by  the  closed- 
cycle  system  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  Based  on  the  small  volume  of  water  withdrawn  for 
the  closed-cycle  cooling  water  system  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the 
annual  entrainment  of  organisms  during  operation  of  the  intake  system  is  expected  to  be  minor 
and  average  less  than  125  organisms  per  100  m3.  Bay  Anchovy,  the  likely  dominantly  entrained 
species  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  is  a  highly  abundant  species  in  the  area,  with  females 
spawning  every  4  to  5  days  over  the  spawning  season  (Zastrow  et  al.  1991-TN2670).

2. 3. 1.3  Cooling  Water  Discharge  Impacts 

Blowdown  from  the  cooling  towers,  service  water  system,  and  other  aqueous  waste  streams  at 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  combined  and  discharged  to  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  at  an  average  flow  rate  of  50,516  gpm  (113  cfs)  and  a  velocity  of  9.2 
fps,  as  described  in  Section  5.2.3. 1  of  the  EIS.  The  submerged  48-in.  diameter  discharge  pipe 
would  be  located  8,000  ft  north  of  the  SGS  discharge  pipe  and  4,000  ft  north  of  the  HCGS 
discharge  pipe.  The  outlet  of  the  discharge  pipe  would  be  1 00  ft  from  the  shoreline,  and  the 
discharge  point  would  be  at  a  location  12  ft  below  mean  lower  low  water  and  3  ft  above  the  river 
bottom  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Relative  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  the  discharged  water 
would  have  an  elevated  temperature  and  increased  concentration  of  both  natural  chemical 
constituents  and  chemical  contaminants.  Because  of  the  tidal  nature  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  in  this  area,  the  direction  of  the  thermal  discharge  plume  would  vary  with  the  tidal  cycle 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Thermal  Impacts 

Potential  thermal  impacts  on  aquatic  organisms  could  include  heat  stress,  cold  shock,  and  the 
creation  of  favorable  conditions  for  invasive  species. 

As  described  in  Section  5.2.3. 1  of  the  EIS,  the  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  where 
discharge  would  occur  is  located  in  Zone  5  between  Delaware  RM  78.8  and  RM  48.2.  The 
DRBC  temperature-related  standards  for  Zone  5  require  that  the  discharge-induced  water 
temperature  increases  above  the  ambient  water  temperature  in  the  river  outside  the  permitted 
heat  dissipation  area  (HDA)  may  not  increase  by  more  than  4°F  (2.2°C)  from  September 
through  May  and  by  1.5°F  (0.8°C)  from  June  through  August,  with  a  year-round  maximum  water 
temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR  Part  410;  DRBC  201 1-TN2371 )  (see  Figure  4).  Recent 
trawling  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  zone  in  the  vicinity  of  SGS  and  HCGS  between  2003 
and  2010  has  not  identified  significant  shifts  in  species  abundances  near  the  SGS  and  HCGS 
discharge  areas  compared  with  adjacent  zones  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566; 
PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG 
201 0-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1 -TN257 1 ).  The  volume  of  the  thermal  discharge  from  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (50,51 6  gpm)  is  only  2.4  percent  of  that  from  SGS  (about 
2,100,000  gpm  circulated  through  the  once-through  cooling  system)  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  As 
discussed  in  Section  5.2.3. 1 ,  the  thermal  plume  of  the  discharge  from  a  new  plant  would  have  a 
maximum  extent  of  about  700  ft  into  the  river  from  the  discharge  location,  about  300  ft  upstream 
from  the  discharge,  and  about  500  ft  downstream  from  the  discharge.  This  thermal  plume 
would  be  contained  completely  within  the  existing  SGS  HDA  and  would  not  be  expected  to 
impede  fish  migration.  During  flood  tide  conditions,  when  the  median  water  temperature 
exceeds  79.4°F  (26.3°C),  the  review  team  estimated  that  a  portion  of  the  thermal  plume  would 
exceed  86°F  (30°C)  because  of  the  cumulative  effects  from  SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  (3.6°F,  1.5°F,  1.5°F,  respectively).  However,  the  combination  of  high  velocity 
discharge,  turbulence  in  the  discharge  outlet  area,  and  rapid  mixing  of  the  discharge  effluent 
would  limit  the  size  of  the  thermal  plume.

A  factor  related  to  thermal  discharges  that  may  affect  aquatic  biota  is  cold  shock,  which  occurs 
when  aquatic  organisms  that  have  been  acclimated  to  warm  water  are  exposed  to  a  sudden 
temperature  decrease.  This  sometimes  occurs  when  single-unit  power  plants  shut  down 
suddenly  in  winter,  or  when  an  unseasonable  cold  weather  event  occurs.  Cold  shock  is  less 
likely  to  occur  at  a  multiple-unit  plant  because  the  temperature  decrease  from  shutting  down 
one  unit  is  moderated  by  the  heated  discharge  from  the  units  that  continue  to  operate.  Based 
on  the  foregoing,  any  thermal  impacts  on  the  fish  populations  due  to  cold  shock  would  be 
expected  to  be  minor. 

Chemical  Impacts 

As  described  in  EIS  Section  3.2.1 .2,  the  cycles  of  concentration  increase  the  concentration  of 
total  dissolved  solids  and  minerals  in  the  blowdown.  In  addition,  the  blowdown  would  contain 
chemical  additives  such  as  biocides  and  pH-adjusting  chemicals  to  ensure  proper  functioning  of 
the  cooling  towers.  Predicted  concentrations  of  dissolved  chemical  constituents  in  the 
discharges  from  the  cooling  water  and  other  systems  are  expected  to  be  compliant  and 
controlled  by  the  terms  of  the  NJPDES  permit  that  would  be  issued  for  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Physical  Impacts 

Because  of  the  increased  temperature  and  chemical  content  of  the  discharged  water  compared 
to  ambient  conditions,  the  plume  is  expected  to  be  negatively  buoyant  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 
Due  to  the  high  discharge  velocity  of  9.21  fps,  there  would  be  rapid  mixing  with  tidal  currents 
upstream  and  downstream,  with  some  potential  for  scouring  (erosion)  occurring  at  the  point  of 
discharge.  To  minimize  the  scouring  potential,  PSEG  would  place  riprap  or  other  engineered 
features  near  the  end  of  the  discharge  pipe  and  reduce  the  possible  interactions  of  the 
discharge  plume  with  bottom  habitats  and  bottom-dwelling  aquatic  organisms  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452). 

Barge  Traffic 

Use  of  the  HCGS  barge  slip  and  the  new  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility  are  expected  to 
be  infrequent  during  operation.  However,  propeller  wash  may  cause  localized  scouring  and 
sedimentation  within  the  barge  slip.  Because  this  area  would  be  previously  disturbed  during  site 
preparation  and  used  during  transport  of  building  materials,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  temporary 
habitat  disruption  would  have  adverse  effects  on  the  aquatic  communities  in  the  area 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Adjacent,  undisturbed  habitat  is  available,  and  mobile  aquatic 
organisms  would  likely  avoid  the  barge  slip  area. 

Maintenance  Dredging 

Dredging  may  be  required  to  maintain  use  of  the  HCGS  barge  slip  and  intake  channel,  as  well 
as  the  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility  during  operation.  Any  effects  to  water  quality,  such 
as  siltation,  during  these  infrequent  periods  would  be  temporary  and  would  be  managed  through 
the  use  of  Federal  and  State  permitting  requirements  for  use  of  BMPs,  and  dredged  material 
disposal  would  be  in  approved  upland  disposal  areas  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Mobile  organisms 
in  the  area  would  avoid  activities  involved  in  dredging  and  could  use  adjacent,  undisturbed 
habitat  during  the  temporary  disruption.

Stormwater  Management 

As  described  in  EIS  section  5. 2. 3.1,  PSEG  would  develop  an  SWPPP  to  minimize  stormwater 
drainage  effects  to  nearby  surface  waters.  The  SWPPP  would  be  required  to  meet  NJPDES 
stormwater  discharge  requirements. 

3.0  FEDERALLY  LISTED  SPECIES  CONSIDERED 

NMFS  (NMFS  201 0-TN21 7 1 )  identified  aquatic  species  under  its  jurisdiction  that  are  Federally 
listed  as  threatened  or  endangered  and  one  species  that  was  listed  as  a  candidate  species  that 
may  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  vicinity  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  By  2013,  the  previously  listed  candidate  species  (Atlantic  Sturgeon,  Acipenser 
oxyrinchus  oxyrinchus)  was  updated  to  endangered,  and  an  updated  list  of  Federally  protected 
species  near  the  PSEG  Site  was  provided  by  NMFS  (NMFS  2013-TN2804).  These  species  are 
listed  in  Table  1  and  also  are  described  in  detail  in  the  following  sections. 

3.1  Loggerhead  Sea  Turtle 

3.1.1  Species  Description 

The  Federally  threatened  loggerhead  turtle  ( Caretta  caretta )  has  a  slightly  elongated,  heart 
shaped  carapace  that  tapers  towards  the  posterior  and  has  a  broad,  triangular  head 
(NRDC  2009-TN2788).  Loggerheads  normally  weigh  up  to  450  pounds  (lb;  200  kilograms  [kg]) 
and  attain  a  straight  carapace  length  of  up  to  48  in.  (120  cm)  (NRDC  2009-TN2788). 

Loggerheads  reach  sexual  maturity  at  about  35  years  of  age  (NMFS  201 3-TN2792).  Females 
nest  on  sandy  ocean  beaches  every  other  to  every  third  year  from  April  through  September 
along  the  southeastern  coast  of  the  U.S.,  and  nesting  usually  peaks  in  late  June  and  July 
(Dodd  1988-TN354).  Females  lay  2  to  3  clutches  of  eggs  per  nesting  year,  and  each  clutch 
consists  of  35  to  180  eggs  that  hatch  in  46  to  68  days  (NMFS  2013-TN2792). 

3.1.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

Loggerhead  turtles  are  circumglobal  and,  in  the  western  Atlantic  Ocean,  occur  from  Argentina 
northward  to  Newfoundland,  including  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  the  Caribbean  Sea.  Adult 
loggerheads  occupy  oceanic  beaches,  deepwater  ocean,  and  nearshore  ocean  habitats  during 
their  migration  from  foraging  habitats  to  nesting  beaches  (Dodd  1988-TN354).  Adult  female 
loggerheads  nest  above  the  high-tide  line  and  sometimes  in  vegetation  at  the  top  of  sandy 
beaches.  Approximately  90  percent  of  the  loggerhead  nesting  activity  in  the  United  States  is  in 
Florida  (Meylan  et  al.  1994-TN2806).  Newly  emerged  turtles  immediately  crawl  toward  the  sea, 
probably  orienting  toward  the  reflected  light  of  the  moon  (Dodd  1988-TN354).  Those  that  reach 
the  water  swim  rapidly  offshore.  The  initial  swimming  frenzy  may  take  them  13  to  17  mi 
offshore.  They  remain  offshore  for  3  to  5  years  (NMFS  201 3-TN2792)  and  are  about  1 .5  ft  long 
when  they  return  to  coastal  waters  to  forage  as  subadults.  Subadult  and  adult  loggerheads  are 
primarily  bottom  feeders,  foraging  in  coastal  waters  for  benthic  mollusks  and  crustaceans 
(Plotkin  1995-TN2508).

3.1.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

The  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (FWS)  listed  the  loggerhead  on  the  Federal  List  of 
Endangered  and  Threatened  Wildlife  under  the  ESA  on  July  28,  1978  (43  FR  32800-TN2753). 

A  5-year  review  considered  52  populations  throughout  the  Atlantic,  Pacific,  and  Indian  oceans 
and  concluded  loggerhead  populations  could  be  separated  into  distinct  population  segments 
(DPSs)  (NMFS  and  FWS  2008-TN360).  On  March  16,  2010,  the  NMFS  published  a  proposed 
rule  to  list  nine  loggerhead  DPSs  under  the  ESA  (75  FR  12598-TN2763).  The  proposed  rule 
identifies  the  Northwest  Atlantic  DPS,  which  includes  those  loggerheads  nesting  along  the 
coasts  of  North  America,  Central  America,  northern  South  America,  the  Antilles,  and  the 
Bahamas,  as  an  endangered  DPS.  This  DPS  constitutes  the  most  significant  nesting 
assemblage  of  loggerheads  in  the  western  hemisphere,  would  include  those  loggerheads  that 
migrate  as  far  north  as  New  Jersey,  and  has  been  reported  to  show  declining  numbers  of 
observable  nests  over  the  last  several  decades  (75  FR  12598-TN2763).  In  addition,  mortality 
from  fishery  bycatch  of  commercial  gillnet,  longline,  and  trawl  fisheries  throughout  the  nearshore 
and  offshore  Atlantic  Ocean  is  a  significant  threat  to  the  persistence  of  this  DPS,  and  increased 
risk  of  vessel  strike  for  migrating  loggerheads  has  also  become  a  growing  concern  (75  FR 
12598-TN2763).  Despite  conservation  efforts  to  protect  nesting  habitat  and  improve  fishing 
methods  to  reduce  bycatch,  the  Northwest  Atlantic  DPS  is  currently  under  consideration  to  be 
upgraded  from  threatened  to  endangered  (75  FR  12598-TN2763).  There  is  no  reported 
loggerhead  turtle  nesting  along  Delaware  Bay  beaches,  though  they  do  forage  in  the  bay. 
Loggerhead  turtles  are  historically  the  most  commonly  observed  sea  turtle  species  in  the  vicinity 
of  PSEG  (Eggers  1989-TN2778). 

3.2  Green  Sea  Turtle 

3.2.1  Species  Description 

The  Federally  threatened  green  sea  turtle  ( Chelonia  mydas)  is  the  largest  of  the  hard-shelled 
sea  turtles  but  has  a  small,  nearly  oval  carapace  and  a  small,  rounded  head  (NRDC  2009- 
TN2788).  Full  grown  adult  green  turtles  weigh  220  to  330  lb  (100  to  150  kg)  and  attain  a 
straight  carapace  length  of  35  to  40  in.  (90  to  100  cm)  (NRDC  2009-TN2788). 

Green  turtles  reach  sexual  maturity  at  20  to  50  years  of  age  (NMFS  201 3-TN2796).  In  the 
southeastern  U.S.,  females  nest  between  June  and  September,  with  peak  nesting  between 
June  and  July  (NMFS  2013-TN2796).  Although  males  mate  annually,  females  only  nest  every 
two  to  four  years  (NMFS  201 3-TN2796).  Mature  females  may  nest  an  average  of  5  times  per 
season  at  about  14-day  intervals.  The  average  clutch  size  is  around  135  eggs,  which  usually 
hatch  within  60  days  (NMFS  201 3-TN2796). 

3.2.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

In  the  western  Atlantic,  several  major  assemblages  have  been  identified  and  studied  (NMFS 
and  FWS  1991-TN358).  In  U.S.  Atlantic  waters,  green  turtles  are  found  around  the  U.S.  Virgin 
Islands,  Puerto  Rico,  and  the  continental  United  States  from  Texas  to  Massachusetts  (NMFS 
and  FWS  1991-TN358).  Nesting  grounds  extend  from  Texas  to  North  Carolina,  as  well  as  in  the 
U.S.  Virgin  Islands  and  Puerto  Rico,  and  important  feeding  ground  within  the  U.S.  Atlantic  and 


NUREG-2168 


F. 3. 1-26

Appendix  F 


Gulf  of  Mexico  includes  the  Indian  River  Lagoon,  the  Florida  Keys,  Florida  Bay,  Crystal  River, 
and  St.  Joseph  Bay  (NMFS  2013-TN2796).  Critical  habitat  is  designated  in  waters  around  Isla 
Culebra,  Puerto  Rico  (NMFS  2013-TN2796). 

Green  turtles  occupy  three  habitat  types  at  different  stages  in  their  life  cycle.  For  nesting, 
females  require  the  high-energy  (wave  active),  sandy  beaches  of  barrier  islands  and  mainland 
shores  above  the  high-water  line.  Upon  emergence,  hatchlings  immediately  seek  out  the  shore 
and  open  water.  Juvenile  green  turtles  drift  with  the  prevailing  surface-water  currents  until  they 
reach  a  size  of  12  to  16  in.,  at  1  to  3  years,  and  then  return  to  shallow  coastal  waters.  Juvenile 
green  turtles  and  adults  spend  most  of  their  lives  in  shallow  benthic  feeding  grounds.  Foraging 
habitats  for  juvenile  and  adult  green  turtles  are  primarily  pastures  of  seagrasses  or  macroalgae 
in  less  than  66  ft  of  water.  A  favorite  seagrass  food  of  green  turtles  throughout  the  Caribbean 
and  south  Florida  is  turtle  grass  ( Thalassia  testudinum ).  Thalassia  is  a  highly  productive 
seagrass  and  can  support  as  many  as  138  adult  female  green  turtles  per  hectare.  However, 
juvenile  green  turtles  often  are  found  over  shallow  hard-bottom  habitats,  such  as  coral  and 
rocky  reefs  (NMFS  and  FWS  1991-TN358).  During  feeding,  subadult  green  turtles  do  not 
wander  far  but  rather  remain  within  a  small  area  of  0.4  mi2  or  less.  A  typical  dive  cycle  during 
feeding  in  Florida  lasts  about  33  minutes,  of  which  1  minute  is  spent  at  the  surface  between 
dives  and  30  minutes  is  spent  on  the  bottom  foraging  on  seagrass  or  algae.  Thus,  green  turtles 
are  hard  to  monitor  in  their  feeding  grounds  because  they  spend  more  than  50  minutes  of  each 
hour  submerged  (Nelson  1988-TN2808). 

3.2.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

The  FWS  listed  the  green  sea  turtle  on  the  Federal  List  of  Endangered  and  Threatened  Wildlife 
under  the  ESA  on  July  28,  1978  (43  FR  32800-TN2753),  and  the  NMFS  and  FWS  published  a 
recovery  plan  for  the  U.S.  green  turtle  population  in  1991  (NMFS  and  FWS  1991-TN358).  In 
2007,  the  NMFS  and  FWS  published  a  5-year  review  of  the  green  sea  turtle  (NOAA  and 
FWS  2007-TN1587)  and  reported  that  four  of  the  six  major  nesting  rookeries  had  shown 
population  increases,  and  data  for  the  other  two  nesting  rookeries  indicated  that  the  populations 
were  stable.  NMFS  and  FWS  (NOAA  and  FWS  2007-TN1587)  recommended  that  the  green 
sea  turtle  remain  listed  under  the  ESA  but  that  a  review  of  the  species  should  be  conducted  to 
determine  the  applicability  of  the  1996  DPS  policy  (61  FR  4722-TN2756)  to  the  species. 

Most  sources  of  mortality  for  sea  turtles  in  U.S.  coastal  waters,  including  green  turtles,  are 
human  activities,  such  as  incidental  take  in  bottom  trawls,  particularly  shrimp  and  summer 
flounder  nets;  coastal  gill  net  and  pound  net  fisheries  (Witzell  and  Cramer  1995-TN2809); 
ingestion  of  marine  debris  (Witzell  and  Teas  1994-TN2509);  and  channel  dredging  (NMFS  and 
FWS  1991-TN358). 

Collisions  with  boats,  particularly  boat  propellers,  also  are  an  important  cause  of  the  death  of 
green  turtles  found  stranded  on  the  shore.  Oil  pollution  from  spills  and  tank  cleaning  may  kill 
some  green  turtles  and  other  marine  turtles  through  tarball  ingestion  or  fouling  of  the  body  with 
oil  from  surface  slicks.  Three  Atlantic  green  sea  turtles  were  reported  at  the  SGS  intake 
between  1980  and  1992  (PSEG  2014-TN3452),  but  none  have  been  reported  at  the  SGS  intake 
since  1992  (NRC  2010-TN281 1).

3.3  Hawksbill  Sea  Turtle 

3.3.1  Species  Description 

The  Federally  endangered  hawksbill  (Eretmochelys  imbricata)  is  a  medium-sized  tropical  and 
subtropical  species  that  inhabits  the  warm  waters  of  the  Atlantic,  Pacific,  and  Indian  oceans 
(NMFS  and  FWS  201 3-TN2507).  The  hawksbill  is  the  most  tropical  of  the  sea  turtles  and  is 
restricted  primarily  to  warmer  waters  more  than  the  other  four  sea  turtles  found  in  the  Gulf  of 
Mexico.  In  U.S.  territorial  waters,  hawksbills  occur  along  the  U.S.  coast  of  south  Texas  and 
along  the  Gulf  and  Atlantic  coasts  of  Florida,  although  adults  may  migrate  farther  up  the  Atlantic 
coast  as  opportunistic  foragers.  Adult  nesting  females  have  a  carapace  length  of  about  34  in. 
and  weigh  about  176  lb.  The  largest  hawksbill  on  record  weighed  276  lb.  Hatchlings  are  about 
1.7  in.  long  and  weigh  0.5  to  0.7  ounce  (NMFS  and  FWS  2013-TN2507).  Hawksbills  are 
believed  to  reach  reproductive  age  in  20  years,  and  females  nest  approximately  every  other 
year  (NMFS  and  FWS  2013-TN2507).  Newly  hatched  hawksbill  turtles  occupy  oceanic  habitats 
associated  with  sargassum  mats  and  other  floating  vegetation.  Once  juveniles  reach  20  to  30 
cm  in  carapace  length,  they  switch  to  neritic  habitats  and  feed  on  algae  and  small  crustaceans 
(NMFS  and  FWS  2013-TN2507). 

3.3.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

Much  more  is  known  about  hawksbill  nesting  sites  than  habitat  usage  during  non-reproduction 
life  histories.  Hawksbills  show  a  high  fidelity  to  their  nesting  beaches  and  return  to  the  same  or 
a  nearby  beach  year  after  year  (Meylan  1989-TN2163).  There  have  only  been  a  few  verified 
reports  of  hawksbill  turtle  nesting  in  south  Florida,  mostly  on  the  east  coast  (NMFS  and 
FWS  2013-TN2507).  Juveniles  and  subadults  tend  to  remain  and  feed  on  coral  reefs  near  their 
natal  beaches.  Like  other  species  of  sea  turtles,  hatchling  hawksbills  congregate  in  sargassum 
rafts  to  feed  and  grow  for  a  year  or  more  after  emerging  from  the  nest  (NMFS  and  FWS  2013- 
TN2507).  While  in  the  sargassum  rafts,  they  consume  pelagic  fish  eggs  and  larvae,  small 
invertebrates  associated  with  the  floating  algae,  and  the  sargassum  itself.  Subadults  and  adults 
are  omnivorous  scavengers.  They  seem  to  prefer  benthic  invertebrate  prey,  particularly 
sponges  and  biofouling  organisms.  Because  of  their  food  preferences,  they  tend  to  be  most 
abundant  in  shallow  coral  and  rocky  reef  habitats. 

3.3.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

First  listed  as  endangered  in  1970  (35  FR  8491-TN2751 ),  the  status  of  the  hawksbill 
was  reviewed  for  status  potential  in  1995  (Plotkin  1995-TN2508).  A  5-year  review  published  in 
2013  indicates  that  numbers  of  adults,  subadults,  and  juveniles  are  increasing  in  the  Caribbean 
and  Florida  foraging  areas  (NMFS  and  FWS  2013-TN2507).  In  the  U.S.  Caribbean  and  the 
Florida  Keys,  overexploitation  severely  depleted  hawksbills  during  the  20th  century.  At  present, 
since  banning  the  sale  of  turtle  shell  products,  they  may  be  no  longer  in  decline  in  the  Atlantic 
region. 

Hawksbill  turtles  are  subjected  to  and  share  many  of  the  natural  and  anthropogenic 
disturbances  as  the  other  sea  turtles  in  Atlantic  waters.  The  two  main  concerns  that  affect 
hawksbills  are  climate  change  and  commercial  fishery  activities.  Climate  change  through

increased  sea  temperatures,  changes  in  circulation  patterns,  and  sea-level  rise  may  result  in 
reproductive  behaviors  and  temperature-dependent  sex  determination,  beach  erosion,  and 
reduced  availability  of  foraging  resources  (IPCC  2007-TN2801 ).  Hawksbills  are  also 
susceptible  to  nearshore  fishery  practices  such  as  drift  netting,  trawling,  and  long-lining  (NMFS 
and  FWS  2013-TN2507).  Strandings  of  hawksbills  are  restricted  almost  exclusively  to  Florida, 
Puerto  Rico,  and  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands.  Hawksbills  appear  to  be  unusually  vulnerable  to 
ingestion  of  marine  debris,  particularly  plastics.  Nearly  90  percent  of  the  debris  ingested  by 
hawksbills  is  plastic  bags,  plastic  and  Styrofoam  particles,  and  tar  (Witzell  and  Teas  1994- 
TN2509).  There  have  been  no  formal  documented  reports  of  hawksbill  sea  turtles  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  PSEG  Site. 

Hawksbill  turtles  do  not  nest  along  Delaware  Bay  beaches,  have  not  been  documented  in 
Delaware  Bay  water,  and  have  not  been  taken  at  SGS  since  preoperational  and  operational 
monitoring  studies  were  initiated.  The  review  team  concludes  that  building  and  operation  of  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  no  effect  on  hawksbill  sea  turtles,  and 
this  species  will  not  be  discussed  further. 

3.4  Kemp’s  Ridley  Sea  Turtle 

3.4.1  Species  Description 

The  Federally  endangered  Kemp’s  ridley  ( Lepidochelys  kempii)  is  the  smallest  of  living  sea 
turtle  species.  Adults  weigh  up  to  90  lb  (42  kg)  and  attain  a  straight  carapace  length  up  to  27  in. 
(70  cm)  (NRDC  2009-TN2788). 

Kemp’s  ridleys  reach  sexual  maturity  between  the  ages  of  10  and  15  years  (IUCN-MTSG  2013- 
TN2800).  During  the  nesting  season,  females  aggregate  onshore  in  large  groups  to  lay  2  to  3 
clutches  of  about  100  eggs  each  between  May  and  July  along  the  coast  near  Rancho  Nuevo, 
Tamaulipas,  Mexico  (NMFS  2013-TN2795).  Kemp’s  ridley  eggs  hatch  in  45  to  70  days,  and 
1.5-in.  (3.8-cm)  hatchlings  emerge  2  to  3  days  later  (NMFS  2013-TN2795).  Those  hatchlings 
that  reach  the  water  quickly  move  offshore  and  remain  in  the  open  sea  until  maturity. 

3.4.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

The  Kemp’s  ridley  has  the  most  restricted  geographical  range  of  the  sea  turtle  species  because 
it  is  only  known  to  primarily  nest  in  one  main  beach  area — Rancho  Nuevo,  Tamaulipas,  Mexico 
(NMFS  and  FWS  2007-TN2793).  Females  occasionally  use  two  additional  nesting  grounds  in 
Padre  Island,  Texas,  and  Veracruz,  Mexico  (TEWG  2000-TN2784).  Adults  migrate  through  the 
Gulf  of  Mexico,  the  Caribbean,  and  the  northwest  Atlantic  Ocean. 

Hatchlings  migrate  rapidly  down  the  beach  and  out  to  sea,  where  they  spend  a  period  of 
perhaps  2  years  in  the  pelagic  zone.  They  are  about  8  in.  long  at  the  end  of  the  pelagic  period. 
Little  is  known  about  the  feeding  behavior  and  food  preferences  of  hatchling  Kemp’s  ridley 
turtles  during  their  pelagic  stage;  they  presumably  feed  on  zooplankton  and  floating  matter, 
including  sargassum  weed  and  the  associated  biotic  community.  Following  a  pelagic  feeding 
stage  shortly  after  hatching  and  lasting  for  several  months,  the  juvenile  ridleys  move  into 
shallow  coastal  waters  to  feed  and  grow.  The  young  subadults  often  forage  in  water  less  than  3

Appendix  F 


ft  deep,  but  they  tend  to  move  into  deeper  water  as  they  grow.  Juvenile  to  adult  ridleys  prey  on 
crabs,  particularly  blue  crabs;  mollusks;  and  small  fish.  Because  of  their  preference  for  crabs 
and  other  primarily  shallow-water  demersal  prey,  juvenile  and  adult  ridley  turtles  concentrate  in 
coastal  waters  less  than  30  ft  deep  throughout  their  range.  They  make  long  dives  to  the  bottom 
and  may  feed  on  the  bottom  for  an  hour  or  more  at  a  time  (TEWG  2000-TN2784). 

3.4.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

The  FWS  listed  the  Kemp’s  ridley  on  the  Federal  List  of  Endangered  and  Threatened  Wildlife 
under  the  ESA  on  December  2,  1970  (35  FR  18319-TN2752),  and  NMFS  and  FWS  published  a 
recovery  plan  for  the  species  in  1992  (NMFS  and  FWS  1992-TN2798).  The  major  factors  in  the 
historic  decline  of  ridley  turtles  are  thought  to  be  predation  (animal  and  human)  of  eggs  on  the 
major  nesting  beach  and  incidental  take  in  commercial  fisheries  in  the  U.S.  and  Mexican  Gulf  of 
Mexico  and  western  North  Atlantic.  Current  impacts  include  anthropogenic  disturbance, 
entanglement  in  fishing  gear  (e.g.,  monofilament  fishing  line  or  discarded  fishing  nets),  and 
marine  debris  ingestion  (e.g.,  plastic  bags  and  plastic  particles).  Under  some  circumstances, 
chemical  pollution  may  be  a  threat  to  ridley  turtles.  Recovery  efforts  have  made  progress  in  the 
protection  of  this  species,  and  the  current  Kemp’s  ridley  recovery  plan  (NMFS  et  al.  2010- 
TN1691)  predicts  that,  assuming  current  survival  rates  remain  constant,  the  Kemp’s  ridley 
population  will  grow  between  12  and  16  percent  per  year  and  could  reach  10,000  nesting 
females  per  season  by  2015.  Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtles  are  known  to  occur  in  Delaware  Bay 
waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  (Eggers  1989-TN2778). 

3.5  Leatherback  Sea  Turtle 

3.5.1  Species  Description 

The  Federally  endangered  leatherback  sea  turtle  ( Dermochelys  coriacea)  is  the  largest  living 
sea  turtle  and  the  only  sea  turtle  that  does  not  have  a  hard,  bony  shell.  It  has  a  leathery,  blue- 
black  shell  composed  of  a  thick  layer  of  oily,  vascularized,  cartilaginous  material,  strengthened 
by  a  mosaic  of  thousands  of  small  bones.  Leatherbacks  can  weigh  up  to  2,000  lb  (900  kg)  and 
attain  a  straight  carapace  length  of  55  in.  (140  cm)  (NMFS  2013-TN2794;  NRDC  2009- 
TN2788). 

Leatherbacks  reach  sexual  maturity  at  the  age  of  12  to  15  years.  Leatherbacks  mate  in  waters 
adjacent  to  nesting  grounds,  and  the  species  nests  around  the  world,  including  along  the  coasts 
of  northern  South  America,  west  Africa,  the  U.S.  Caribbean,  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands,  and 
southeast  Florida  (NMFS  201 3-TN2794).  Females  nest  from  late  February  or  March  through 
September;  during  the  season,  they  nest  1  to  9  times  at  about  9-  to  17-day  intervals.  Females 
lay  between  50  and  170  eggs,  which  hatch  within  50  to  75  days  (NMFS  2013-TN2794). 

3.5.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

Leatherbacks  are  circumglobally  distributed  and  occur  in  the  Atlantic,  Indian,  and  Pacific 
oceans.  Leatherback  turtles  are  a  largely  oceanic,  pelagic  species,  but  they  also  forage  in 
coastal  waters.  Juveniles  and  adults  feed  throughout  the  water  column  to  depths  of  at  least 
3,900  ft,  consuming  jellyfish  and  other  gelatinous  zooplankton,  such  as  salps,  ctenophores,  and 
siphonophores  (NMFS  2013-TN2794).  Most  feeding  dives  average  about  200  ft  but  frequently

extend  from  985  to  1300  ft  (Eckert  2002-TN3359).  In  the  past,  the  leatherback's  seasonal 
inshore  movements  off  south  Texas  have  been  linked  to  inshore  movements  of  their  preferred 
jellyfish  prey.  Only  a  small  fraction  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and  North  Atlantic  leatherback 
populations  nest  on  beaches  of  the  continental  United  States,  mostly  in  Florida  and  the  U.S. 
Virgin  Islands,  where  nesting  occurs  from  April  to  July  (Meylan  et  al.  1994-TN2806).  Because 
leatherback  turtles  are  a  largely  oceanic,  pelagic  species,  estimates  of  their  population  status 
and  trends  have  been  difficult  to  obtain.  In  addition,  nesting  females  do  not  have  the  nest-site 
fidelity  exhibited  by  other  turtles  and  tend  to  move  to  different  beaches  in  different  years 
(NMFS  2013-TN2794).  Therefore,  it  has  been  difficult  to  estimate  temporal  trends  in  population 
size. 

3.5.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

The  FWS  listed  the  leatherback  on  the  Federal  List  of  Endangered  and  Threatened  Wildlife 
under  the  ESA  on  June  2,  1970  (35  FR  8491 -TN2751 ).  In  the  2007  5-year  review  of  the 
species,  NMFS  and  FWS  (NMFS  and  FWS  2007-TN1690)  indicated  that  the  Atlantic  population 
within  Florida  has  shown  an  increase  in  nests  from  98  in  1988  to  800  to  900  in  the  early  2000s. 
Nesting  also  increased  in  Puerto  Rico,  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands,  and  the  British  Virgin  Islands 
from  the  1980s  to  the  2000s  (NMFS  and  FWS  2007-TN1690).  Leatherbacks  are  especially 
susceptible  to  entanglement  in  fishing  gear  and  plastic  debris  (Witzell  and  Teas  1994-TN2509). 
Because  they  are  adapted  to  a  pelagic  existence,  they  have  trouble  maneuvering  in  tight  places, 
swimming  backward,  and  avoiding  obstructions  in  shallow  waters.  The  large  front  flippers  of 
leatherbacks  often  bear  cuts  or  chafing  marks  or  are  severed  altogether,  possibly  because  of 
entanglement.  Because  of  their  preferred  diet  of  gelatinous  zooplankton,  particularly  jellyfish, 
leatherback  turtles  often  ingest  floating  plastic  debris,  mistaking  it  for  food  (Wallace  1985- 
TN2810).  The  leatherback  turtle  does  not  nest  along  Delaware  Bay  beaches  and  has  not  been 
documented  in  Delaware  Bay  waters.  Like  the  hawksbill  turtle,  leatherback  turtles  have  not 
been  taken  at  the  SGS  since  preoperational  and  operational  monitoring  studies  were  initiated. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  would  have  no  effect  on  leatherback  sea  turtles,  and  this  species  will  not  be 
discussed  further. 

3.6  Shortnose  Sturgeon 

3.6.1  Species  Description 

The  Shortnose  Sturgeon  (Acipenser  brevirostrum)  is  an  anadromous,  primitive  bony  fish  that 
can  be  differentiated  by  other  sturgeon  species  by  its  smaller  size  and  shorter  and  blunter  nose 
than  other  sturgeon  species.  Shortnose  Sturgeon  grow  to  a  length  of  4.7  ft  (1 .4  m)  and  typically 
weigh  up  to  50.7  lb  (23  kg)  (NMFS  2013-TN2791 ).  Juveniles  mature  into  adults  at  a  fork  length 
of  18  to  22  in.  (45  to  55  cm),  which,  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  coincides  to  about  3  to  5 
years  of  age  in  males  and  6  to  7  years  of  age  in  females  (NMFS  201 3-TN2791 ).  The 
Shortnose’s  lifespan  varies  from  30  years  (males)  to  67  years  (females).  The  Shortnose 
Sturgeon  migrates  earlier  in  the  year  than  other  Atlantic  Sturgeon  species.  Adults  begin  to 
migrate  upstream  to  freshwater  in  the  winter,  spend  most  of  the  winter  in  deep  waters  of  rivers 
and  estuaries,  and  spawn  between  January  and  mid-May  (Dadswell  et  al.  1984-TN2780). 

Water  temperature  is  a  major  determining  factor  of  spawning  time,  and  Shortnose  begin  to

Appendix  F 


spawn  when  water  temperatures  reach  46  to  48°F  (8  to  9°C)  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149),  which  in 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  early  to  mid-April  (NOAA  2013-TN2790).  Females  produce 
40,000  to  200,000  dark  brown  to  black-colored  eggs  each  spring  and  lay  their  eggs  in  fast 
flowing  waters  over  rock,  rubble,  or  hard  clay  substrate  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Eggs  are 
separate  when  spawned  but  become  adhesive  within  20  minutes  of  being  fertilized  and  adhere 
to  hard  substrates  on  the  river  bottom  (Dadswell  et  al.  1984-TN2780).  Eggs  hatch  in 
4  to  15  days  with  incubation  time  being  inversely  correlated  with  water  temperate;  eggs  hatch  in 
8  days  at  63°F  (17°C)  and  in  13  days  at  50°F  (10°C)  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Larvae  consume 
their  yolk  sac  and  begin  feeding  in  8  to  12  days,  as  they  migrate  downstream  and  away  from  the 
spawning  site  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Juveniles  feed  on  benthic  insects  and  crustaceans  and 
remain  in  freshwater  until  the  following  winter,  at  which  time  they  migrate  to  brackish  estuaries, 
where  they  remain  for  3  to  5  years.  As  adults,  they  migrate  to  the  nearshore  marine 
environment,  where  their  diet  consists  of  mollusks  and  large  crustaceans  (Shepherd  2006- 
TN2785). 

3.6.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

Shortnose  Sturgeon  inhabit  rivers,  estuaries,  and  nearshore  marine  environments.  The  species 
spawns  in  coastal  rivers  along  the  Atlantic  coast  from  St.  John  River,  New  Brunswick,  Canada, 
south  to  St.  Johns  River,  Florida  (NMFS  2013-TN2791 ).  Shortnose  occur  in  most  major  river 
systems  along  the  Atlantic  coast,  including  the  Savannah  River,  Georgia;  the  Chesapeake  Bay 
system;  the  Delaware  River;  the  Hudson  River,  New  York;  the  Connecticut  River;  and  the  lower 
Merrimack  River,  Massachusetts  (NMFS  201 3-TN2791 ).  Surveys  of  Shortnose  Sturgeon 
movement  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  revealed  an  overwintering  population  of  about  6,000 
to  14,000  fish  in  the  upper  tidal  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  Trenton  at  RKM 
21 1 .8  (RM  1 31 .6)  (Hastings  et  al.  1987-TN2260).  Shortnose  Sturgeon  move  upstream  into  the 
non-tidal  reach  of  the  Delaware  River  in  late  March  presumably  to  spawn  before  traveling 
downstream  to  lower  tidal  waters  near  Philadelphia  (O'Herron  et  al.  1993-TN2261 ).  Hastings  et 
al.  (Hastings  et  al.  1987-TN2260)  observed  upstream  movement  to  non-tidal  water  as  far  as 
Lambertville  at  RKM  238  (RM  147.9),  and  there  are  some  records  that  indicate  Shortnose 
Sturgeon  occur  as  far  upriver  as  Frenchtown  near  RKM  263.5  (RM  163.7)  (NJDEP  2013- 
TN2722). 

Shortnose  Sturgeon  larvae  hatch  in  freshwater,  and  juveniles  migrate  from  freshwater  riverine 
environments  to  brackish  estuarine  environments  between  the  ages  of  3  and  5  years.  Adults 
inhabit  nearshore  marine  areas  and  are  not  believed  to  travel  long  distances  offshore  during 
their  annual  migration  routes  (NMFS  2013-TN2791). 

3.6.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

No  historical  population  estimates  are  available  for  the  Shortnose  Sturgeon.  Though  never 
widely  commercially  fished,  the  species  was  often  incidentally  taken  in  fishing  gear,  and  by  the 
1950s,  the  lack  of  recorded  Shortnose  landings  led  the  FWS  to  conclude  that  the  species  was  in 
danger  of  extinction  (NMFS  2013-TN2791 ).  The  FWS  listed  the  Shortnose  Sturgeon  on  the 
Federal  List  of  Endangered  and  Threatened  Wildlife  under  the  ESA  on  March  11,1 967  (32  FR 
4001-TN2750).  A  Recovery  Plan  was  developed  for  the  species  in  1998,  which  recognized  19 
DPSs  along  the  Atlantic  Coast  because  Shortnose  Sturgeon  return  to  their  natal  rivers  to  spawn

each  year,  resulting  in  minimal  genetic  intermixing  (NMFS  1 998-TN2783).  NMFS  initiated  a 
status  review  of  the  Shortnose  Sturgeon  on  November  30,  2007  (72  FR  67712-TN2759).  NMFS 
expected  to  complete  the  status  review  in  2009;  however,  the  deadline  for  providing  comments 
pertaining  to  the  review  was  extended  on  January  29,  2008  (73  FR  5177-TN2760),  and  to  date, 
this  status  review  has  not  been  published.  Shortnose  Sturgeon  are  known  to  occur  in  waters 
near  the  PSEG  Site. 

3.7  Atlantic  Sturgeon 

3.7.1  Species  Description 

The  Atlantic  Sturgeon  {Acipenser  oxyrinchus  oxyrinchus)  is  an  anadromous  bony  fish  that  can 
grow  to  14  ft  (4.3  m)  and  weigh  up  to  800  lbs  (370  kg)  (Gilbert  1989-TN2149;  NMFS  2012- 
TN2797).  Atlantic  Sturgeon  are  similar  in  appearance  to  Shortnose  Sturgeon — bluish-black  to 
olive  brown  dorsally  with  pale  sides  and  underbelly — but  are  larger  in  size  and  have  a  smaller 
and  differently  shaped  mouth  (NMFS  2012-TN2797).  Females  reach  maturity  at  7  to  30  years 
of  age,  and  males  reach  maturity  at  5  to  24  years  of  age,  with  those  fish  inhabiting  the  southern 
range  maturing  earlier  (ASMFC  2007-TN2771 ). 

In  the  mid-Atlantic,  adults  migrate  upriver  from  April  to  May  to  spawn.  Females  in  the  Delaware 
River  produce  0.8  to  2.4  million  highly  adhesive  eggs,  which  fall  to  the  bottom  of  the  water 
column  and  adhere  to  cobble  or  other  hard  bottom  substrate  (ASSRT  2007-TN2082; 

Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Eggs  hatch  in  94  to  140  hours  at  temperatures  of  20°C  (68°F)  and  18°C 
(64.4°F),  respectively  (ASSRT  2007-TN2082).  Larvae  consume  their  yolk  sac  in  8  to  12  days, 
during  which  time  larvae  migrate  downstream  into  brackish  water,  where  they  live  for  a  few 
months  (ASSRT  2007-TN2082).  When  juveniles  reach  a  size  of  30  to  36  in.  (76  to  92  cm),  they 
migrate  to  nearshore  coastal  waters,  where  they  feed  on  benthic  invertebrates,  including 
crustaceans,  worms,  and  mollusks  (NMFS  2012-TN2797). 

3.7.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

Historically,  the  Atlantic  Sturgeon  has  inhabited  riverine,  estuarine,  and  coastal  ocean  waters 
from  the  St.  Lawrence  River,  Canada,  to  St.  Johns  River,  Florida  (ASMFC  2013-TN2770). 
However,  within  the  U.S.,  the  species  is  only  known  to  remain  in  the  Hudson  River,  Delaware 
River,  and  a  few  South  Carolina  river  systems  (ASMFC  2013-TN2770).  At  one  time,  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  supported  the  largest  population  of  Atlantic  Sturgeon  along  the  Atlantic 
coast  (Secor  and  Waldman  1999-TN2207).  Tagging  studies  in  2005  and  2006  indicated  that 
Atlantic  Sturgeon  follow  migration  patterns  similar  to  Shortnose  Sturgeon  with  spawning 
potentially  occurring  in  mid-to-late  June  in  the  upper  tidal  Delaware  reaches  between 
Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  and  Trenton,  New  Jersey  (Simpson  and  Fox  2007-TN2194). 

Atlantic  Sturgeon  larvae  hatch  in  freshwater,  and  larvae  migrate  from  freshwater  to  brackish 
estuarine  environments,  where  they  remain  for  a  few  months  to  a  few  years  (NMFS  2012- 
TN2797).  Juveniles  and  non-spawning  adults  inhabit  estuaries  and  coastal  marine  waters 
dominated  by  gravel  and  sand  substrates  (NMFS  2012-TN2797).

3.7.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

Atlantic  Sturgeon  have  been  commercially  fished  from  as  early  as  1628,  though  a  substantial 
Atlantic  Sturgeon  fishery  did  not  appear  until  the  late  1800s  (Shepherd  2006-TN2785).  In  1998, 
the  Atlantic  States  Marine  Fisheries  Commission,  which  manages  the  commercial  harvest  of  the 
species,  instituted  a  moratorium  on  Atlantic  Sturgeon  harvest  in  U.S.  waters  (NMFS  2012- 
TN2797).  Based  on  data  from  2001  to  2006,  the  ASMFC  (ASMFC  2007-TN2771 )  estimated 
that  between  2,752  and  7,904  individuals  per  year  are  caught  as  bycatch  in  sink  gillnets,  and 
2,167  to  7,210  individuals  per  year  are  caught  as  bycatch  in  trawls.  In  a  2007  Status  Review  of 
the  species,  the  Atlantic  Sturgeon  Status  Review  Team  (ASSRT  2007-TN2082)  noted  that  little 
is  known  about  the  size  and  spawning  of  the  Delaware  River  population,  but  that  the  current 
population  has  been  greatly  reduced  within  all  life  stages. 

On  October  6,  2010,  the  NMFS  published  Proposed  Listing  Determinations  for  five  Atlantic 
Sturgeon  DPSs  and  listed  the  Atlantic  Sturgeon  as  endangered  (75  FR  61872-TN2758;  75  FR 
61904-TN2764).  The  PSEG  Site  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  part  of  the  proposed  New 
York  Bight  DPS,  which  includes  the  Long  Island  Sound,  the  New  York  Bight,  and  the  Delaware 
Bay  from  Chatham,  Massachusetts,  to  the  Delaware-Maryland  border.  On  February  6,  2012, 
the  Atlantic  Sturgeon  New  York  Bight  DPS  was  listed  as  endangered  (77  FR  5880-TN2081 ). 
Atlantic  Sturgeon  are  known  to  occur  in  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site. 

4.0  PROPOSED  ACTION  EFFECTS  ANALYSIS 

A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  may  affect  Federally  listed  species  in  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary  in  the  following  ways: 

1 .  Dredging  and  in-water  installation  activities  associated  with  improvements  to  the  existing 
HCGS  barge  slip,  a  new  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility,  the  intake  and  discharge 
structures,  and  causeway  structures 

2.  Impingement  of  listed  individuals  as  juveniles  or  adults  at  the  facilities’  water  intake  point 
(impingement  occurs  when  aquatic  organisms  are  pinned  against  intake  screens  or  other 
parts  of  the  cooling  water  system  intake  structure) 

3.  Entrainment  of  eggs  or  larvae  of  listed  species  at  the  facilities’  water  intake  point 
(entrainment  occurs  when  aquatic  organisms — usually  eggs,  larvae,  and  other  small 
organisms — are  drawn  into  the  cooling  water  system) 

4.  Discharge  of  cooling  water  effluent  at  the  facilities’  discharge  point  (thermal,  chemical,  and 
physical  effects  may  occur  to  aquatic  organisms  present  in  the  vicinity  of  the  point  of 
discharge  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary) 

5.  Maintenance  dredging  of  the  HCGS  barge  slip,  barge  storage,  and  unloading  facility 

6.  Barge  traffic  during  building  and  operation  may  cause  localized  sedimentation  and  scouring 

4.1  Dredging  and  In-Water  Building 

For  each  of  the  sea  turtle  and  sturgeon  species,  dredging  and  in-water  building  activities  and 
barge  traffic  are  not  likely  to  affect  Federally  listed  species  that  may  be  in  the  vicinity  of  the 


NUREG-2168 


F. 3. 1-34 

F-92

Appendix  F 


intake,  discharge,  and  barge  facility  areas  at  the  PSEG  Site  or  HCGS  barge  slip  area  because 
the  turtles  and  sturgeon  would  avoid  any  noise  or  disturbances.  Causeway  installation  activities 
also  are  not  likely  to  affect  any  sea  turtle  or  sturgeon  species  because  of  their  lack  of  preference 
for  marsh  creek  habitat. 

4.2  Impingement 

HCGS  has  not  reported  any  impingement  of  listed  turtle  and  sturgeon  species  in  its  intake  since 
it  began  operating  in  1986  (PSEG  2009-TN2209),  and  thus,  has  no  historical  impingement 
records.  Because  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  operate  using  intake  and 
discharge  technologies  similar  to  HCGS  (closed-cycle  cooling)  and  would  be  compliant  with 
NJPDES  permitting  requirements,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  a  new  plant  also  would  not  be 
expected  to  impinge  listed  turtle  or  sturgeon  species.  The  review  team  concludes  that  turtle  or 
sturgeon  strandings  on  the  PSEG  Site  intake  trash  bars  are  unlikely  and  would  be  limited  to 
moribund  or  compromised  individuals. 

4.3  Entrainment 

Entrainment  of  sea  turtle  eggs  or  hatchlings  is  not  possible  because  sea  turtles  lay  their  eggs  on 
beaches  along  the  southeastern  coast  of  the  United  States  and,  after  emerging,  hatchlings 
quickly  swim  to  deep  ocean  water  where  they  remain  until  breeding  age  (NMFS  2013-TN2792). 
When  juveniles  are  old  enough  to  migrate  to  nearshore  coastal  areas,  they  are  large  enough 
that  they  would  not  be  susceptible  to  entrainment. 

The  life  history  of  the  Shortnose  and  Atlantic  Sturgeon  species  suggests  that  entrainment  of 
sturgeon  eggs  or  larvae  is  unlikely.  As  mentioned  in  Sections  3.6  and  3.7,  respectively,  within 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  Shortnose  Sturgeon  spawn  upriver  of  Trenton  (RM  131  [RKM  211], 
whereas  Atlantic  Sturgeon  spawn  between  Philadelphia  and  Trenton  (between  RM  109  and  RM 
131  [RKM  176  and  RKM  21 1])  in  the  upper  freshwater-tidal  reaches  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary.  The  PSEG  site  is  located  downriver  at  RM  52  (RKM  84)  in  brackish  water.  Eggs 
adhere  to  river  substrate,  and  juvenile  stages  tend  to  remain  in  freshwater  or  fresher  areas  of 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  for  3  to  5  years  before  moving  downriver  to  more  saline  reaches  of 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  or  ocean.  The  NRC  (NRC  201 1-TN3131)  noted  that  PSEG  has  not 
collected  the  eggs  or  larvae  of  sturgeon  in  annual  entrainment  monitoring  samples  from  1978  to 
2008  at  either  HCGS  or  SGS.  Thus,  sturgeon  eggs  or  larvae  are  unlikely  to  be  present  in  the 
water  column  at  the  PSEG  Site  intake,  and  entrainment  of  sturgeon  eggs  or  larvae  is  unlikely. 

4.4  Discharge  Impacts 

The  potential  impacts  of  increased  water  temperatures  at  the  PSEG  discharge  on  sea  turtles 
and  sturgeon  species  is  expected  to  be  minimal.  Both  SGS  and  HCGS  have  NJPDES  permits 
that  place  thermal  limits  on  the  maximum  discharge  temperature  and  maximum  change  in 
ambient  estuary  temperature  caused  by  facility  discharge  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ).  The  high  exit 
velocity  of  discharge  water  produces  rapid  dilution,  which  limits  high  temperatures  to  relatively 
small  areas  of  the  initial  mixing  zone  for  HCGS,  and  is  assumed  to  be  similar  for  a  new  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  Sea  turtles  and  sturgeon  species  may  largely  avoid  these  areas  because  of 
high  velocity  and  turbulence.  As  described  in  Section  2.3,  the  thermal  discharge  is  not  expected 


November  2015 


F. 3. 1-35 


NUREG-21 68 


F-93 


Appendix  F 


to  alter  foraging  behavior  because  the  buoyant  thermal  plume  would  rise  toward  the  surface  of 
the  estuary  and  is  limited  in  size.  Reproduction  and  nursery  areas  for  sea  turtles  and  sturgeon 
species  do  not  occur  in  the  area  of  the  discharge.  Chemical  and  physical  impacts  also  are  not 
expected  to  adversely  affect  water  quality  or  habitat  quality  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  due  to 
compliance  with  chemical  discharge  permitting  required  by  the  NJPDES  permit,  engineered 
placement  of  discharge  structures,  and  protection  of  bottom  habitat  from  scouring.  Therefore, 
the  review  team  does  not  expect  the  discharge  from  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  to  adversely 
affect  sea  turtles  or  sturgeon  species. 

4.5  Maintenance  Dredging 

Dredging  may  be  required  to  maintain  use  of  the  HCGS  barge  slip  and  the  cooling  water  intake 
channel  as  well  as  barge  storage  and  the  unloading  facility  during  operation.  As  with  in-water 
installation  activities,  sea  turtle  and  sturgeon  species  are  not  likely  to  be  affected  by 
maintenance  dredging  because  sea  turtles  and  sturgeon  would  avoid  any  noise  or  disturbances 
in  the  area. 

4.6  Barge  Traffic 

Disruption  of  habitat  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  from  sedimentation  and  scouring  due  to 
propeller  wash  is  expected  to  be  localized  and  temporary  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Sea  turtles 
and  sturgeon  species  likely  would  avoid  habitats  in  the  area  of  incoming  and  outgoing  barge 
traffic  and  could  find  unaffected  habitat  nearby  for  foraging  activities. 

5.0  CUMULATIVE  EFFECTS  ANALYSIS 

Many  historical  events  have  affected  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin  and  its  resources 
(Berger  et  al.  1994-TN2127).  As  Europeans  began  settling  the  estuary  region  early  in  the  17th 
century,  agriculture  expanded,  and  the  clearing  of  forest  led  to  erosion.  Dredging,  diking,  and 
filling  gradually  altered  extensive  areas  of  shoreline  and  tidal  marsh.  By  the  late  1800s, 
industrialization  had  altered  much  of  the  watershed  of  the  upper  estuary,  and  fisheries  were 
declining  because  of  overfishing  as  well  as  pollution  from  ships,  sewers,  and  industry.  By  the 
1940s,  anadromous  fish  were  blocked  from  migrating  upstream  to  spawn  because  of  a  barrier  of 
low  oxygen  levels  in  the  Philadelphia  area.  This  barrier,  combined  with  small  dams  on 
tributaries,  nearly  destroyed  the  herring  and  shad  fisheries.  A  large  increase  in  industrial 
pollution  in  the  early-to-mid  1900s  resulted  in  the  Delaware  River  near  Philadelphia  becoming 
one  of  the  most  polluted  river  reaches  in  the  world.  Major  improvements  in  water  quality  began 
in  the  1960s  and  continued  through  the  1980s  as  a  result  of  State,  multi-State,  and  Federal 
actions,  including  the  Clean  Water  Act  and  the  activities  of  the  DRBC  (PDE  201 2-TN21 91 ).  The 
Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin  is  the  subject  of  numerous  restoration  activities  and  projects 
under  the  purview  of  the  Partnership  for  the  Delaware  Estuary,  the  DRBC,  and  numerous 
research  and  academic  institutions.  In  its  2012  annual  report,  the  Partnership  for  the  Delaware 
Estuary  suggested  that  the  overall  environmental  conditions  of  the  region  were  fair  (PDE  2012- 
TN2191).  Since  2008,  some  conditions  were  found  to  be  declining  in  areas  such  as  sediment 
removal  impairing  estuarine  habitats  and  a  decline  in  young-of-year  Atlantic  Sturgeon,  and 
some  areas  were  seeing  improvements  such  as  a  reduction  of  total  organic  carbon  and  an 
increase  in  Striped  Bass  populations  (PDE  2012-TN21 91 ).

Appendix  F 


Other  actions  in  the  vicinity  that  have  present  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  impacts  on  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  include  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  the  completion  of 
dredging  operations  for  the  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  by  the  USACE, 
and  potential  construction  of  a  new  transmission  corridor  and  transmission  line  by  PJM 
Interconnection,  LLC,  for  grid  stability.  Planning  and  development  for  the  new  transmission 
corridor  would  avoid  or  span  channelized  waterways,  perennial  streams,  and  intermittent 
streams  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Development  for  new  transmission-line  crossings  would  require 
BMPs  to  protect  water  quality  and  minimize  effects  to  aquatic  habitats  that  may  be  at  risk  from 
clearing  activities,  runoff,  and  bank  erosion.  An  estimated  77,088  linear  ft  of  stream  habitat 
(S&L  2010-TN2671)  is  within  the  5-mi-wide  macro-corridor  for  the  hypothetical  transmission  line 
discussed  in  Sections  7.1  and  7.3.2.  The  hypothetical  transmission  line  would  cross  the 
Delaware  River  and  would  require  installation  of  footings.  Placement  of  footings  would  result  in 
permanent  benthic  habitat  loss,  but  this  loss  would  be  minimal  when  compared  to  available 
adjacent  habitat.  Installation  activities  would  be  managed  through  use  of  BMPs  required  for 
Federal  and  State  permitting  to  minimize  siltation  and  protect  adjacent  aquatic  habitats.  PSEG 
would  consult  with  Federal  and  State  agencies,  as  required,  when  an  exact  route  is  identified 
and  installation  effects  to  protected  species  can  be  directly  assessed  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Water  quality  in  the  region  may  be  affected  by  continued  withdrawal  and  discharge  of  water  to 
support  power  generation.  Large  commercial  and  recreational  fisheries  harvest  fish  and 
invertebrates  that  make  up  the  ecological  community  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  The 
effects  of  natural  environmental  stressors  such  as  climate  change  and  extreme  weather  events 
also  would  affect  aquatic  communities  in  the  region. 

Each  of  the  current  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  may  influence  the  structure  and 
function  of  estuarine  food  webs  and  result  in  observable  changes  to  the  aquatic  resources  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary.  In  most  cases,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  quantitatively  the  impact 
of  individual  stressors  or  groups  of  stressors  on  aquatic  resources  because  they  affect  the 
region  simultaneously,  and  their  effects  are  cumulative. 

5.1  Continued  Operation  of  the  SGS  Once-Through  Cooling  System 

Based  on  the  assessment  presented  in  the  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for 
License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants — Supplement  45:  Regarding  Hope  Creek  Generating 
Station  and  Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2  Final  Report  (NRC  201 1 -TN31 31 ), 
NRC  staff  concluded  that  “entrainment,  impingement,  and  thermal  discharge  impacts  on  aquatic 
resources  from  the  operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  collectively  have  not  had  a  noticeable 
adverse  effect  on  the  balanced  indigenous  community  of  the  Delaware  Estuary.”  However, 
operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  continues  to  impinge  and  entrain  aquatic  species  and  would 
contribute,  in  part,  to  the  cumulative  loss  of  these  species  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

Several  improvements  to  the  cooling  water  intake  structures  have  been  made  to  reduce 
impingement  mortality  at  SGS.  Some  of  these  improvements  included  installation  of  modified 
traveling  screens,  installation  of  improved  screen  mesh,  and  modifications  to  spray  wash  nozzle 
configurations  (PSEG  2009-TN2513).  Decades  of  monitoring  and  survey  data  for  finfish  and 
aquatic  invertebrates  have  been  used  to  assess  species  density  and  richness  in  the  vicinity  of 
SGS  as  directed  under  NJPDES  permits  starting  in  1994  and  in  subsequent  renewals 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Impingement,  entrainment,  and  fish  assemblage  sampling  by  trawling

Appendix  F 


and  seining  are  conducted  each  year,  in  accordance  with  NJPDES  permit  requirements  for 
biological  monitoring.  The  reporting  emphasis  is  on  targeted  representative  important  species 
that  include  Blueback  Herring,  Alewife  (Alosa  pseudoharengus),  American  Shad,  Atlantic 
Menhaden,  Bay  Anchovy,  Atlantic  Silverside,  White  Perch,  Striped  Bass,  Bluefish  (Pomatomus 
saltatrix),  Weakfish,  Spot  (Leiostomus  xanthurus),  and  Atlantic  Croaker  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 
All  of  these  representative  important  species  also  are  considered  either  recreationally  or 
commercially  important  or  are  ecologically  important  as  forage  fish  for  sustainability  of  the 
ecosystem  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  They  are  discussed  in  more  detail  in  Section 
2. 4. 2. 3  of  the  EIS.  Although  individual  species  abundances  change  year  to  year,  the  overall 
trends  in  community  abundances  and  diversity  show  no  significant  changes  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452). 

5.2  Continued  Operation  of  the  HCGS  Closed-Cycle  Cooling  System 

HCGS  uses  closed-cycle  cooling  and  therefore  requires  substantially  less  water  volume  for 
cooling  operations  (maximum  of  66,000  gpm  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary).  Accordingly, 
effects  on  the  aquatic  community  through  impingement,  entrainment,  and  discharge  also  are 
expected  to  be  reduced  when  compared  with  the  once-through  cooling  system  at  SGS 
(NRC  201 1-TN3131).  Impingement  studies  at  HCGS  were  performed  only  in  1986  and  1987  at 
the  commencement  of  operation  for  the  single  unit  and  showed  a  reduced  overall  impingement 
rate  when  compared  to  SGS  (see  EIS  Section  5.3.2).  Because  HCGS  was  operating 
concurrently  with  SGS,  the  NJPDES  permit-directed  biological  monitoring  of  the  aquatic 
community  through  trawling  and  seining  studies  also  reflected  the  combined  effect  of  both 
HCGS  and  SGS  operations.  Therefore,  the  conclusions  regarding  the  effect  of  continued 
operation  of  SGS  also  apply  to  HCGS  in  that  the  overall  species  diversity  and  community 
abundances  near  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  continue  to  show  no  noticeable  effects  from 
operations  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ). 

5.3  SGS  and  HCGS  Effects  on  Protected  Species 

Relicensing  of  SGS  and  HCGS  is  under  ongoing  consultation  pursuant  to  Section  7  of  the  ESA 
for  species  under  NMFS  jurisdiction  (NRC  2010-TN281 1 ).  NMFS  issued  a  Biological  Opinion 
for  the  two  facilities  on  May  14,  1993  (PSEG  1999-TN2787),  which  was  amended  by  letter 
dated  January  21,  1999  (NMFS  1999-TN271 1). 

Consultation  pursuant  to  Section  7  of  the  ESA  regarding  the  nearby  SGS  and  HCGS  has  been 
ongoing  between  the  NRC  and  NMFS  since  1979.  In  1980,  NMFS  issued  a  Biological  Opinion 
that  concluded  that  the  continued  operation  of  these  facilities  was  not  likely  to  jeopardize  the 
Shortnose  Sturgeon  and  set  a  take  limit  of  up  to  1 1  Shortnose  Sturgeon  per  year.  Sea  turtles 
were  not  included  in  the  1980  Biological  Opinion. 

The  NRC  reinitiated  consultation  on  August  19,  1988,  because  SGS  had  impinged  a  number  of 
sea  turtles.  NMFS  issued  a  revised  Biological  Opinion  on  January  2,  1991,  to  include  sea 
turtles.  In  this  Biological  Opinion,  NMFS  concluded  that  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS 
would  affect  sea  turtles  but  would  not  jeopardize  the  continued  existence  of  any  populations  of 
threatened  or  endangered  species.  The  1991  Biological  Opinion  also  reduced  the  number  of 
allowable  Shortnose  Sturgeon  takes  based  on  actual  levels  of  impingement  at  SGS  and  HCGS 
up  to  that  point. 


NUREG-2168 


F.  3. 1-38 

F-96 


November  2015 


Appendix  F 


NMFS  modified  the  1991  Biological  Opinion  on  August  4,  1992,  to  increase  the  total  allowable 
take  limit  for  loggerheads  and  Shortnose  Sturgeon.  However,  between  June  and  October  1992, 
SGS  and  HOGS  exceeded  their  take  limit  for  Kemp’s  rid  ley  mortalities  and  met  their  take  limit 
for  Shortnose  Sturgeon  mortalities.  NMFS  issued  another  Biological  Opinion  on  May  14,  1993 
(PSEG  1 999-TN2787),  which  did  not  change  the  take  limits  of  listed  species  but  specified  that 
SGS  and  HOGS  should  develop  a  research  program  using  mark/recapture  to  determine 
whether  SGS  has  features  that  attract  sea  turtles.  Also  in  1993,  PSEG  implemented  a  policy  of 
removing  the  ice  barriers  from  the  trash  racks  on  the  intake  structure  between  May  1  and 
October  24,  which  resulted  in  substantially  lower  turtle  impingement  rates  at  SGS. 

The  NRC  reinitiated  Section  7  Consultation  in  1998  to  remove  the  study  requirement  from  the 
SGS  and  HOGS  Incidental  Take  Statement.  The  NRC  cited  the  change  in  PSEG  procedure 
regarding  removal  of  ice  barriers  during  the  spring  and  summer.  In  response,  NMFS  issued  a 
Biological  Opinion  on  January  21,  1999,  that  removed  the  study  requirement  and  decreased  the 
number  of  annual  allowable  takes  of  Shortnose  Sturgeon  from  10  individuals  to  5  individuals 
based  on  the  review  of  Shortnose  Sturgeon  capture  rates  at  SGS  and  HOGS.  The  Biological 
Opinion  also  formalized  ice  barrier  removal  from  May  1  through  October  24  by  making  it  a 
requirement  in  the  “Terms  and  Conditions”  section  of  the  Biological  Opinion.  To  implement  the 
1999  Biological  Opinion,  PSEG  developed  associated  guidance  documents,  Biological  Opinion 
Compliance  anti  Species  Management  {PSEG  1999-TN2787). 

Table  3  provides  a  summary  of  the  incidental  take  limits  for  each  Biological  Opinion  that  NMFS 
issued,  including  the  current  1999  Biological  Opinion  take  limits.  The  leatherback  sea  turtle, 
hawksbill  sea  turtle,  and  the  Atlantic  Sturgeon  have  not  been  included  in  previous  assessments 
of  SGS  and  HOGS  impacts  or  in  previous  Biological  Opinions. 

The  current  Biological  Opinion  (NMFS  1999-TN271 1)  Incidental  Take  Statement  was  amended 
on  January  21,1 999,  and  revised  the  number  of  incidental  takes  of  listed  species  as  detailed  in 
Table  3.

The  Biological  Opinion  also  contains  the  following  “Reasonable  and  Prudent  Measures,"  which 
apply  to  SGS: 

•  Removable  ice  barriers  located  on  the  trash  racks  must  be  removed  by  May  1  of  each  year 
and  replaced  after  October  24  of  each  year. 


November  2015

NUREG-21 68

Appendix  F 


•  Trash  racks  associated  with  SGS’s  circulating  water  system  must  be  cleaned  three  times 
per  week  from  May  1  through  November  1 5  and  must  be  cleaned  daily  from  June  1  through 
October  15. 

•  Trash  racks  must  be  inspected  every  two  hours  from  June  1  through  October  15. 

•  If  a  lethal  incidental  take  that  is  directly  attributable  to  the  plant  occurs  between  June  1  and 
October  1 5,  monitoring  of  the  trash  racks  must  be  increased  to  hourly  for  the  remainder  of 
the  year. 

A  previous  Biological  Opinion  (PSEG  1999-TN2787)  concluded  that  HOGS  would  not  affect 
listed  species  because  no  species  had  been  documented  at  the  site  between  when  the  plant 
began  operating  in  1986  and  the  1993  Biological  Opinion,  which  did  not  require  monitoring  at 
HOGS  beyond  normal  cleaning  operations.  The  1999  Biological  Opinion  did  not  modify  any 
requirement  specific  to  HOGS. 

The  “Terms  and  Conditions”  portion  of  the  Biological  Opinion  requires  PSEG  to  report  all 
incidental  takes  to  NMFS  within  30  days  of  the  take  and  to  include  appropriate  documentation  in 
the  report.  Additionally,  the  “Terms  and  Conditions”  detail  a  number  of  requirements  for  sea 
turtle  resuscitation,  live  sea  turtle  inspection,  dead  sea  turtle  necropsy  reports,  and  Shortnose 
Sturgeon  tagging  and  inspection.  An  updated  Biological  Opinion  is  expected  to  be  issued  by 
NMFS,  and  it  will  include  requirements  for  the  Atlantic  Sturgeon,  which  has  been  recently  listed 
as  endangered. 

Between  1 992  and  2001 ,  1 6  loggerhead  turtles  were  stranded  at  SGS  (NRC  201 0-TN281 1 ), 
while  3  Atlantic  green  turtles  have  been  captured  at  SGS  since  it  began  operations,  with  all 
captures  occurring  between  1980  and  1992  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  In  1992,  two  live  and  two 
dead  Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtles  were  found  at  the  SGS  cooling  water  intake;  the  cause  of 
mortality  was  not  reported  (PSEG  1992-TN3173).  In  1993,  a  live  Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtle  was 
found  at  the  SGS  cooling  water  intake  (PSEG  1999-TN2787).  Implementation  of  mitigation 
measures  in  1993  reduced  the  likelihood  of  additional  turtle  strandings;  however,  two  Kemp’s 
ridley  turtles  were  stranded  at  SGS  in  2013  (PSEG  2013-TN2690;  PSEG  2013-TN3137). 
Incidental  takes  of  sea  turtle  and  sturgeon  species  at  SGS  between  2000  and  2013  are 
summarized  in  Table  4. 

Since  2000,  three  live  and  nine  dead  Shortnose  Sturgeon  have  been  collected  on  SGS  intake 
structures  (PSEG  2000-TN3150;  PSEG  2003-TN3149;  PSEG  2004-TN3144;  PSEG  2007- 
TN3148;  PSEG  2008-TN3147;  PSEG  2011-TN3146;  PSEG  2011-TN3365;  PSEG  2013- 
TN2707;  PSEG  2013-TN2691;  PSEG  2013-TN2692;  PSEG  2013-TN2695;  PSEG  2013- 
TN2704).  Atlantic  Sturgeon  were  not  reported  at  the  SGS  intake  screens  until  after  this  species 
was  considered  for  listing  as  a  Federally  endangered  species.  Ongoing  consultation  with  NMFS 
to  revise  the  Biological  Opinion  will  result  in  the  inclusion  of  Atlantic  Sturgeon.  During  2012  and 
2013,  14  live  and  7  dead  Atlantic  Sturgeon  were  reported  at  the  SGS  intake  system 
(PSEG  2012-TN3143;  PSEG  2012-TN3142;  PSEG  2013-TN2693;  PSEG  2013-TN2694;  PSEG

5.4  Commercial  and  Recreational  Harvest  of  Fish  and  Shellfish 

The  Delaware  River  Estuary  supports  a  diverse  commercial  and  recreational  fishery  for  finfish 
and  invertebrates.  Losses  to  the  ecosystem  from  fishery  harvest  are  managed  at  the  Federal 
and  State  levels  through  catch  limits,  regulations  on  fishing  gear,  and  seasonal  closures. 
Unintended  harvest  or  mortality  is  another  source  of  loss  through  bycatch  while  targeting  a 
different  species.  These  activities  have  the  potential  to  contribute  to  cumulative  effects  on 
aquatic  species  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  However,  the  direct  contribution  is  difficult  to 
assess  because  many  of  these  fish  populations  have  life  histories  that  involve  a  large  migratory 
territory  offshore  and  along  the  Atlantic  coast  of  the  United  States,  and  therefore,  effects  to 
populations  are  difficult  to  directly  attribute  to  Delaware  River  Estuary  habitat  effects. 

5.5  Habitat  Loss  and  Restoration 

Current  and  future  land  use  development  for  industry,  agriculture,  or  other  habitat  alterations  in 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  watershed  may  affect  water  quality.  These  types  of  activities  may 
also  result  in  shoreline  habitat  loss. 

Dredging  activities  from  past  efforts  to  maintain  navigation  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  may 
have  affected  estuarine  habitats,  and  future  dredging  activities  are  planned  that  may  continue  to 
affect  the  aquatic  ecosystem.  Starting  in  2010,  the  USACE  began  implementing  the  Delaware 
River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  to  deepen  the  existing  navigation  channel  from  40  to  45 
ft  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  To  deepen  the  channel,  material  would  be  dredged  by  hydraulic  and 


November  2015 


F. 3. 1-41 


NUREG-21 68 


F-99 


Appendix  F 


hopper  dredges  and  placed  in  USACE  confined  disposal  facilities  (CDFs)  or  used  for  beneficial 
reuse  purposes  (e.g.,  wetland  and  beach  restoration;  habitat  creation)  in  lower  Delaware  Bay. 
The  USACE  estimates  that  1 ,01 2,428  yd3  of  material  were  dredged  from  Reach  D  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  near  Artificial  Island  and  placed  in  the  Federally-owned  Artificial  Island 
CDF  (USACE  2013-TN2851 ).  When  completed,  the  entire  deepening  project  would  remove 
and  dispose  of  an  estimated  16  million  yd3  of  sediments  from  the  Delaware  River  in  Philadelphia 
down  to  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  Bay.  The  subsequent  maintenance  dredging  would  remove 
an  estimated  4,317,000  yd3  of  sediment  from  the  45-ft-deep  channel  each  year  (USACE  201 1- 
TN2262).  Maintenance  dredging  would  be  carried  out  as  needed,  generally  over  a  2-month 
period  between  August  and  December.  As  with  building  in-river  components  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  fish  and  benthic  invertebrates  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
would  be  displaced  during  the  USACE  dredging  activities  but  are  expected  to  recolonize  the 
affected  areas.  The  USACE  would  implement  appropriate  measures  required  by  Federal  and 
State  agencies  and  organizations  to  protect  aquatic  resources,  including  endangered  species 
(sturgeon  and  sea  turtles),  sharks,  horseshoe  crabs  ( Limulus  polyphemus),  blue  crabs, 
freshwater  mussels,  and  American  Eels  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  For  example,  mechanical 
dredge  activities  between  March  15  and  June  30  would  be  avoided  within  selected  reaches  of 
the  project  area  to  prevent  sedimentation  and  turbidity  effects  on  reproduction  of  Atlantic 
Sturgeon,  Striped  Bass,  American  Shad,  and  river  herring  (USACE  2013-TN2851). 

While  aquatic  habitats  continue  to  be  affected  by  natural  and  anthropogenic  activities  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary,  efforts  to  restore  salt  marsh  and  estuary  habitat  have  met  with  some 
success  and  are  expected  to  continue  in  the  future.  For  example,  ongoing  restoration  activities 
within  the  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA,  located  4  mi  east  of  the  PSEG  Site,  would  restore  nearly  200 
ac  of  the  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  to  address  injuries  to  shoreline  and  bird  resources  resulting 
from  the  2004  Athos  I  oil  spill  (NOAA  2008-TN2721 ).  NJDEP  and  the  National  Oceanic  and 
Atmospheric  Administration  proposed  a  tidal  wetland  restoration  project  that  would  allow 
development  of  smooth  cordgrass  ( Spartina  alterniflora )  habitat  to  improve  habitat  quality  in  the 
area.  Restoration  would  be  accomplished  through  fill  material  removal  to  lower  the  marsh 
elevation  and  allow  tidal  inundation  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  As  described  in  EIS  Section  4.3.1, 
unavoidable  impacts  to  wetlands  during  development  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  mitigated  by  habitat  restoration  and  enhancement, 
using  experience  and  proven  techniques  developed  by  the  PSEG  EEP.  Sensitive  species  that 
utilize  such  marsh  habitats  would  be  affected  positively  by  the  proposed  Mad  Horse  Creek 
WMA  restoration  effort  and  by  the  proposed  mitigation  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  and  causeway  (i.e. ,  restoration  of  low  quality  marsh  habitats)  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

5.6  Climate  Change 

The  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  aquatic  organisms  and  habitat  in  the  geographic 
area  of  interest  are  not  precisely  known.  In  addition  to  rising  sea  levels,  climate  change  could 
lead  to  regional  increases  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  precipitation  events, 
increases  in  annual  precipitation,  and  increases  in  average  temperature  (GCRP  2014-TN3472). 
Such  changes  in  climate  could  alter  aquatic  community  composition  on  or  near  the  PSEG  Site 
through  changes  in  species  diversity,  abundance,  and  distribution.  In  2012,  Hurricane  Sandy 
created  increased  storm  surge  during  this  event  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  had 
moderate  effects  on  water  quality  and  coastal  habitats  within  the  southernmost  portion  of  the

Appendix  F 


Delaware  River  Estuary  through  erosion,  sedimentation,  and  resuspension  of  contaminants 
within  sediments  (ALS  2012-TN2720).  Elevated  water  temperatures,  droughts,  and  severe 
weather  phenomena  could  adversely  affect  or  severely  reduce  aquatic  habitat;  however, 
specific  predictions  on  aquatic  habitat  changes  in  this  region  due  to  climate  change  are 
inconclusive  at  this  time.  The  level  of  impact  resulting  from  these  events  would  depend  on  the 
intensity  of  the  perturbation  and  the  resiliency  of  the  aquatic  communities.  The  DRBC  stated  in 
the  State  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  report  for  2013  that  increases  in  temperature  and  salinity 
are  expected  with  future  sea-level  rise  and  climate  change  (DRBC  2013-TN2609).  These 
potential  changes  are  likely  to  result  in  movement  of  populations  of  more  marine  and  euryhaline 
species  farther  up  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  For  example,  in  a  recent  report,  hard  bottom 
areas  north  and  south  of  the  Chesapeake  and  Delaware  Canal  (upriver  of  the  PSEG  Site)  were 
identified  as  having  potential  as  reef  sites  for  the  establishment  of  new  oyster  beds  and  were 
discussed  as  a  future  conservation  target  due  to  changing  climate  conditions  resulting  in 
increases  in  salinity  farther  upriver  (PDE  201 1-TN2190). 

5.7  Summary  of  Cumulative  Effects 

Aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  cumulatively  affected  to  varying  degrees 
by  multiple  activities  and  processes  that  have  occurred  in  the  past,  are  occurring  currently,  and 
are  likely  to  occur  in  the  future.  The  food  web  and  the  abundance  of  important  aquatic  forage 
species  and  other  species  have  been  substantially  affected  by  these  stressors  historically,  as 
described  in  EIS  Section  2.4.2.  The  effects  of  some  of  these  stressors  associated  with  human 
activities  are  addressed  by  management  actions  (e.g.,  cooling  system  operation,  regulation  of 
fishing  pressure,  water  quality  improvements,  and  habitat  restoration). 

Other  stressors,  such  as  climate  change  and  increased  human  population  and  associated 
development  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  cannot  be  directly  managed,  and  their  effects  are 
more  difficult  to  quantify  and  predict.  It  is  likely,  however,  that  future  anthropogenic  and  natural 
environmental  stressors  would  cumulatively  affect  the  aquatic  community  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  sufficiently  that  they  would  noticeably  alter  important  attributes,  such  as  species  ranges, 
populations,  diversity,  habitats,  and  ecosystem  processes,  just  as  they  have  in  the  past.  These 
stressors  have  modified  important  attributes  of  aquatic  resources  and  would  continue  to  exert 
an  influence  in  the  future,  potentially  destabilizing  some  of  the  attributes  of  the  aquatic 
ecosystem.  Based  on  these  observations,  the  review  team  concludes  that  cumulative  effects 
have  been  noticeable  and  destabilizing  for  some  aquatic  resources,  primarily  based  on  past 
stressors  affecting  aquatic  resources  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin. 

Cumulative  effects  on  aquatic  ecology  resources  are  estimated  based  on  the  information 
provided  by  PSEG,  NMFS,  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review.  The  significant  history  of 
the  degradation  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  has  had  a  noticeable  and  sometimes 
destabilizing  effect  on  many  aquatic  species  and  communities.  Commencement  of  operations 
at  SGS  Units  1  and  2  resulted  in  significant  numbers  of  aquatic  species  being  entrained  and 
impinged,  which  led  to  required  restoration  of  the  area  through  the  PSEG  EEP  as  a  form  of 
mitigation.  In  addition,  present  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  such  as  the 
continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS  and  the  completion  of  dredging  operations  for  the 
Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  would  continue  to  have  effects  on  the  aquatic 
resources  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  However,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the

incremental  contribution  of  the  NRC-authorized  activities  related  to  construction  and  operation 
of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  negligible. 

6.0  CONCLUSION  AND  DETERMINATION  OF  EFFECTS 

Building  activities  associated  with  cooling  water  intake  and  discharge  structures,  HCGS  barge 
slip  improvements,  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility,  and  causeway  would  require 
dredging  and  in-water  work  that  may  cause  siltation  and  disturbance  of  benthic  habitats  on  the 
immediate  areas  of  building  and  in  nearby  coastal  waters.  However,  Federal  and  State 
permitting  requires  BMPs  associated  with  use  of  cofferdams,  siltation  barriers,  and  avoidance  of 
in-water  activities  in  marsh  creeks  during  spawning  cycles  to  control  and  minimize  the  potential 
for  adverse  impacts  to  protected  species.  Dredging  and  installation  of  intake  and  discharge 
structures  would  occur  in  a  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  that  is  used  by  sea  turtles  and 
anadromous  fish.  While  installation  activities  are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  localized,  the 
presence  of  any  of  the  species  described  in  this  document  within  the  installation  area  may 
occur,  although  these  species  should  be  able  to  migrate  around  the  installation  area  and  forage 
in  adjacent,  unaffected  habitat. 

Because  PSEG  proposes  to  use  a  cooling  water  intake  configuration  similar  to  the  closed-cycle 
cooling  at  HCGS,  and  operation  of  HCGS  has  been  determined  to  have  no  adverse  effects  on 
any  listed  sea  turtle  or  sturgeon  species  in  the  future  (NRC  201 0-TN281 1 ),  the  review  team  has 
determined  that  building  and  operation  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
may  affect,  but  are  not  likely  to  adversely  affect  the  loggerhead  sea  turtle,  green  sea  turtle, 
Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtle,  Shortnose  Sturgeon,  and  Atlantic  Sturgeon.

Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  As  part  of  its  review  of  the  ESP 
application,  the  NRC  is  preparing  an  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  as  required  by 
Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  51  (10  CFR  Part  51-TN250) — the  NRC 
regulations  that  implement  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969,  as  amended  (42  USC 
4321  et  seq.  -TN661).  The  EIS  includes  an  analysis  of  pertinent  environmental  issues, 
including  endangered  and  threatened  species  and  impacts  to  fish  and  wildlife.  The  U.S.  Army 
Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  is  participating  in  the  preparation  of  the  EIS  as  a  cooperating 
agency  and  as  a  member  of  the  review  team,  which  consists  of  the  NRC  staff,  its  contractor 
staff,  and  the  USACE  staff.  The  discussion  that  follows  describes  the  ESP  application  and

Department  of  the  Army  permit  application  reviews,  the  proposed  actions  by  the  NRC  and 
USACE,  and  the  activities  over  which  the  USACE  has  jurisdiction. 

An  ESP  is  an  NRC  approval  of  a  site  for  one  or  more  nuclear  power  facilities  that  resolves 
safety  and  environmental  issues  related  to  site  suitability.  Issuance  of  an  ESP  is  a  process  that 
is  separate  from  the  issuance  of  a  construction  permit  (CP)  and  operating  license  (OL)  or  a 
combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (COL)  for  such  a  facility,  which  would  be 
needed  to  construct  and  operate  a  nuclear  power  plant  on  a  site  approved  by  an  ESP.  The 
ESP  application  and  review  process  makes  it  possible  to  evaluate  and  resolve  safety  and 
environmental  issues  related  to  siting  before  the  applicant  makes  a  large  commitment  of 
resources.  If  the  ESP  is  approved,  the  applicant  can  “bank”  the  site  for  up  to  20  years  for  future 
reactor  siting,  but  may  not  conduct  activities  defined  as  “construction”  in  10  CFR  50.10(a)(1) 
(TN249)  without  applying  for  and  receiving  further  authorization.  To  construct  and  operate  a 
nuclear  power  plant,  an  ESP  holder  must  obtain  a  CP  and  an  OL,  or  a  COL,  which  are  separate 
major  Federal  actions  that  require  their  own  environmental  reviews  in  accordance  with  10  CFR 
Part  51  (TN250).  An  applicant  for  a  CP  or  COL  for  a  new  nuclear  plant  to  be  located  at  a  site 
for  which  an  ESP  has  been  issued  may  reference  the  ESP,  and  matters  resolved  in  the  ESP 
proceeding  are  considered  resolved  in  any  subsequent  proceeding  absent  the  identification  of 
new  and  significant  information.  For  a  COL  application  that  references  an  ESP,  the  NRC  staff, 
pursuant  to  1 0  CFR  51 .75(c)(1 )  (TN250),  would  prepare  a  supplement  to  the  ESP  EIS  in 
accordance  with  10  CFR  51.92(e)  (TN250)  and  would  engage  in  new  consultation  in 
accordance  with  section  7(c)  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1 973,  as  amended  (ESA)  (16 
USC  1531-TN1010). 

The  proposed  actions  related  to  the  PSEG  ESP  application  are  (1)  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for 
the  PSEG  Site  (10  CFR  Part  52-TN251)  and  (2)  USACE  permit  action  on  a  Department  of  the 
Army  permit  application  pursuant  to  Section  404  of  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act 
(Clean  Water  Act;  33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  and  Section  10  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors 
Appropriation  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660).  The  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
Agency  (EPA)  has  the  authority  to  review  and  veto  USACE  decisions  on  Section  404  permits. 

As  mentioned  previously,  the  USACE  is  participating  as  a  cooperating  agency  with  the  NRC  in 
preparing  the  EIS  and  participates  collaboratively  on  the  review  team.  Upon  issuance  of  the 
draft  EIS  (NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN4279),  PSEG  submitted  a  Section  10/404  permit 
application  to  the  USACE  on  August  8,  2014  (PSEG  2014-TN4235);  the  Department  of  the 
Army  permit  application  number  is  CENAP-OP-R-2009-01 57-45.  The  NRC  and  USACE 
prepared  this  biological  assessment  (BA)  to  support  their  joint  consultation  with  the  National 
Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  in  accordance  with  section  7(c)  of  the  ESA  (16  USC  1531  et 
seq.  -TNI 010).  The  USACE  permit  decision  will  be  made  following  issuance  of  the  final  EIS 
and  would  authorize  preparation  of  a  haul  road  bulkhead  along  the  shoreline,  building  the  barge 
storage  area  and  unloading  facility  (also  referred  to  as  the  barge  unloading  and  mooring  facility 
in  the  USACE  public  notice  [USACE  2014-TN4235]),  building  the  proposed  5-mi  causeway,  and 
installation  of  the  cooling  water  system  intake  and  discharge  structures.  Therefore,  only  these 
activities,  which  are  identified  in  the  Department  of  Army  permit  application,  are  described  in  this 
assessment.

In  a  final  rule  dated  October  9,  2007  (72  FR  57416-TN260),  the  NRC  limited  the  definition  of 
“construction”  to  the  activities  that  fall  within  its  regulatory  authority,  as  provided  in  10  CFR 
50. 1 0(a)(1 )  (TN249)  and  10  CFR  51 .4  (TN250).  Many  of  the  site-preparation  activities 
associated  with  building  a  nuclear  power  plant  are  not  part  of  the  NRC  action  to  license  the 
plant.  These  activities,  which  are  not  regulated  by  the  NRC  and  therefore  not  within  the  purview 
of  the  NRC  action,  are  grouped  under  the  term  “preconstruction.”  Preconstruction  activities 
include  clearing  and  grading,  excavating,  erecting  support  buildings  and  transmission  lines,  and 
other  associated  activities.  These  preconstruction  activities  may  take  place  before  the 
application  for  an  ESP,  CP/OL,  or  COL  is  submitted,  during  its  review,  or  after  it  has  been 
granted.  Although  preconstruction  activities  are  outside  the  NRC’s  regulatory  authority,  many  of 
them  are  within  the  regulatory  authority  of  local,  State,  or  other  Federal  agencies,  including  the 
USACE. 

While  an  NRC  ESP  does  not  authorize  site-preparation  activities  denoted  as  “preconstruction” 
under  NRC  regulations,  USACE  permits  would  authorize  some  of  those  site-preparation 
activities.  Because  this  is  a  joint  supplemental  BA  for  both  the  NRC  and  USACE,  the  distinction 
between  construction  and  preconstruction  is  not  carried  forward  in  this  BA;  both  are  jointly 
discussed  using  the  term  “site-preparation  activities”  when  discussing  effects  to  species  that 
would  take  place  under  the  proposed  actions. 

By  letter  dated  October  26,  2010  (NRC  2010-TN2203),  the  NRC  initiated  informal  ESA  section  7 
consultation  with  NMFS  and  requested  a  list  of  endangered,  threatened,  candidate,  and 
proposed  species  as  well  as  designated  and  proposed  critical  habitat  that  may  be  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  PSEG  Site.  NMFS  provided  the  requested  information  for  species  under  their  jurisdiction 
by  letter  dated  December  9,  2010  (NMFS  2010-TN2171).  An  update  for  endangered, 
threatened,  candidate,  and  proposed  species  was  requested  on  July  31,  2013  (NRC  2013- 
TN2805).  NMFS  provided  updated  information  by  letter  dated  October  25,  2013  (NMFS  2013- 
TN2804).  NMFS  received  the  draft  EIS  (NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN4279)  and  BA  (NRC  and 
USACE  2014-TN4313)  and  provided  comments  on  November  12,  2014  (NMFS  2014-TN4203), 
and  additional  clarification  on  comments  January  26,  2015  (NRC  201 5-TN4209).  A  revised 
species  list  is  presented  in  Table  1.  This  supplemental  document  addresses  the  comments 
received  and  clarified  related  to  the  following: 

•  clarification  of  activities  considered  for  consultation  regarding  the  PSEG  ESP  and  the 
Department  of  the  Army  permit  (provided  earlier  in  this  section) 

•  additional  information  regarding  dredging  activities  (i.e.,  type  of  equipment  used,  duration, 
and  in-water  work  restrictions) 

•  additional  information  regarding  pile-driving  activities  (i.e.,  type  and  number  of  piles,  duration 
of  installation  activities,  noise  effects  to  ESA  species,  and  mitigation  measures) 

•  additional  information  regarding  barging  activities  (i.e.,  number  and  type  of  vessels  and 
assessment  of  impacts  to  ESA  species  from  PSEG  barge  traffic) 

•  clarification  of  cumulative  impacts  assessed  for  ESA  consultation 

•  revision  of  species-specific  information  to  include  current  status  of  the  SGS/HCGS  Biological 
Opinion.

Accordingly,  this  supplemental  BA  focuses  on  evaluating  the  potential  effects  from  site- 
preparation  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  adjacent  to  SGS  and  HCGS,  on 
the  Federally  listed  species  under  NMFS’s  jurisdiction  that  occur  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 
However,  because  an  ESP  does  not  authorize  the  site-preparation  activities  as  defined  under 
10  CFR  50.10(a)(2)  (TN249)  that  would  take  place  under  the  proposed  action,  the  effects 
discussed  in  this  BA  from  those  site-preparation  activities  are  regulated  by  the  USACE  and  not 
by  the  NRC. 

2.0  DESCRIPTION  OF  PROPOSED  ACTION 

PSEG  is  seeking  an  ESP  from  the  NRC  for  a  site  approval  for  a  potential  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  a  site  (the  PSEG  Site)  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS.  PSEG  is  also 
seeking  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit  from  the  USACE  for  certain  site-preparation  activities 
described  below.  Site-preparation  activities  authorized  by  USACE  and  the  New  Jersey 
Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  (but  not  an  NRC  ESP)  that  could  directly 
affect  onsite  and  offsite  aquatic  ecosystems  include  preparation  of  a  haul  road  bulkhead  along 
the  shoreline,  building  the  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  (also  referred  to  as  the 
barge  unloading  and  mooring  facility  in  the  USACE  public  notice  [USACE  2014-TN4235]), 
building  the  proposed  5-mi  causeway,  installation  of  the  cooling  water  system  intake  and 
discharge  structures,  dredging,  installation  of  piles,  and  transport  of  building  materials  by  barge 
to  the  PSEG  Site.  As  these  actions  require  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit  and  are 
permissible,  but  not  authorized,  under  an  NRC  ESP,  they  are  assessed  in  detail  below. 

2.1  Site  Location  and  Description 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Artificial  Island  was  formed  from  dredge  spoils 
produced  as  a  result  of  maintenance  dredging  of  the  Delaware  River  navigation  channel  by  the 
USACE.  The  site  is  approximately  7  mi  east  of  Middletown,  Delaware;  7.5  mi  southwest  of 
Salem,  New  Jersey;  and  9  mi  south  of  Pennsville,  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Figure  1 
shows  the  location  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  areas  within  a  6-mi  (10-km)  radius  and  50-mi  (80- 
km)  radius  of  the  facility.

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  HCGS  and  SGS  on  the  northwestern  portion  of  the 
existing  PSEG  property.  Figure  2  depicts  the  PSEG  Site  in  relation  to  the  existing  units  and 
nearby  water  bodies.  PSEG  owns  734  ac  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  is  developing  an  agreement 
with  the  USACE  to  acquire  85  ac  immediately  north  of  the  site.  Thus,  the  total  PSEG  Site  would 
encompass  819  ac.  Figure  3  provides  aerial  plan  view  of  the  proposed  site  layout  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  region  within  1 5  mi  (24  km)  of  the  site  is  used  primarily  for  agriculture.  This  region  also 
includes  numerous  parks,  wildlife  refuges,  and  preserves  (e.g.,  Mad  Horse  Creek  Wildlife 
Management  Area  [WMA]  to  the  east;  Cedar  Swamp  State  WMA  to  the  south  in  Delaware; 
Appoquinimink,  Silver  Run,  and  Augustine  State  WMAs  to  the  west  in  Delaware;  and  Supawna 
Meadows  National  Wildlife  Refuge  to  the  north)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2.1.1  Delaware  River  Estuary 

The  Delaware  River  and  Delaware  Bay  are  a  part  of  the  larger  Delaware  Estuary  and  River 
Basin  that  extends  from  headwaters  in  New  York  State  to  the  coastal  plains  near  Cape 
Henlopen  in  Delaware  (PDE  2012-TN2191 ).  The  Delaware  Bay  extends  from  the  confluence  of 
the  Delaware  River  with  the  Atlantic  Ocean  from  Delaware  River  Mile  (RM)  0  to  RM  54  (River 
Kilometer  [RKM]  0  to  RKM  87).  The  Delaware  River  Estuary  includes  the  Delaware  Bay  and 
extends  up  the  tidal  Delaware  River,  which  is  characterized  by  brackish  water  between 
Delaware  RM  54  and  RM  80  (RKM  87  and  RKM  129)  and  becomes  freshwater  at  Delaware  RM 
80  (RKM  129)  (BBL  and  Integral  2007-TN2126).  The  PSEG  Site  near  the  mouth  of  Alloway 
Creek  is  at  Delaware  RM  52  (RKM  84)  (DRBC  201 1-TN2412)  and  is  considered  to  be  in  the 
lower  estuary  watershed  unit  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  (PDE  201 2-TN21 91 ). 

The  boundary  of  salinity  intrusion  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  also  known  as  the  salt  line, 
fluctuates  with  flow  changes.  The  salt  line  moves  in  response  to  the  tides  and  variations  in 
Delaware  River  Estuary  freshwater  discharge.  During  most  of  the  year,  the  salt  line  is  located 
between  the  Commodore  Barry  Bridge  at  Delaware  RM  82  (RKM  132)  and  Reedy  Island  at 
Delaware  RM  54  (RKM  87)  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  Salinity  measurements  taken  over  a 
number  of  years  between  RM  51  and  RM  49  (RKM  82  and  RKM  79)  report  a  minimum  salinity 
of  0.1  parts  per  thousand  (ppt)  and  a  maximum  of  17.9  ppt  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Appendix  F 


At  the  PSEG  Site  on  Artificial  Island,  the  estuary  is  tidal  with  a  net  flow  to  the  south.  The 
USACE  maintains  a  dredged  navigation  channel  near  the  center  of  the  estuary  about  6,600  ft 
(2,000  m)  west  of  the  shoreline  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  navigation  channel  is  about  40  ft  (1 2  m) 
deep  and  1,300  ft  (400  m)  wide;  however,  starting  in  2010,  the  USACE  began  implementing  the 
Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  to  deepen  the  existing  navigation  channel 
from  40  to  45  ft  (USACE  201 1 -TN2262).  On  the  New  Jersey  side  of  the  channel,  water  depths 
in  the  open  estuary  at  mean  low  water  are  fairly  uniform  at  about  20  ft  (6  m).  Predominant  tides 
in  the  area  are  semi-diurnal,  with  a  period  of  approximately  12  hours  and  a  mean  tidal  range  of 
5.3  ft  (1.6  m)  at  RM  52  (RKM  84)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Submerged  aquatic  vegetation  has  not  historically  been  observed  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
primarily  because  of  the  high  levels  of  turbidity  (Miller  et  al.  2012-TN2686)  and  no  submerged 
aquatic  vegetation  was  observed  in  the  sampling  areas  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  a  complex  ecosystem  with  many  species  playing 
different  roles  throughout  their  lifecycles.  Major  assemblages  of  organisms  within  the  estuarine 
community  include  plankton,  benthic  invertebrates,  and  fish.  Detailed  descriptions  of  these 
assemblages  can  be  found  in  Section  2.4.2. 1  of  the  EIS. 

2.2  Dredging  Activities 

Before  initiating  any  site-preparation  or  development  activities,  PSEG  would  be  required  to 
obtain,  from  the  USACE,  the  appropriate  authorizations  regulating  alterations  to  waters  of  the 
United  States,  including  ponds  and  creeks.  Site-preparation  activities  that  could  directly  affect 
onsite  and  offsite  aquatic  ecosystems  include  installing  the  haul  road  bulkhead,  building  the 
barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility,  installing  the  cooling  water  system  intake  and 
discharge  structures,  and  building  the  proposed  causeway  (Figure  2  and  Figure  3).  Aquatic 
habitats  potentially  affected  include  habitats  associated  with  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  the 
interconnected  system  of  tidal  wetlands  and  marsh  creeks  primarily  north  of  the  PSEG  Site. 
Potential  direct  impacts  on  aquatic  resources  as  a  result  of  site-preparation  activities  would 
involve  physical  alteration  of  habitat  (e.g.,  infilling,  dredging)  including  temporary  or  permanent 
removal  of  associated  benthic  organisms,  sedimentation,  changes  in  hydrological  regimes,  and 
changes  in  water  quality.  Potential  indirect  impacts  would  include  increased  runoff  from 
impervious  surfaces  and  subsequent  erosion,  as  well  as  sedimentation  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 
Benthic  habitats  in  the  areas  for  proposed  dredging  consist  of  fine-grained  sediments  composed 
of  clay,  silt,  and  sand.  Shoreline  depths  drop  quickly  to  10  to  12  ft  (3.0  to  3.7  m)  and  then 
gradually  increase  in  depth  to  between  15  to  25  ft  (4.6  to  7.6  m)  nearshore  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  depth  of  the  areas  identified  for  dredging  is  a  minimum  of  1 0  ft  (3.0  m)  relative  to 
mean  low  water  with  the  exception  of  the  western  boundary  of  Artificial  Island,  which  is 
shallower  than  10  ft  (3.0  m)  and  consists  of  artificially  placed  rock.  Mitigation  is  not  warranted 
as  there  is  no  shallow  water  habitat  conversion  to  deep  water  habitat  (PSEG  2015-TN4234), 
and  compensatory  mitigation  is  generally  not  required  where  a  habitat  change  does  not  occur. 
The  nearshore  benthic  macroinvertebrate  community  and  fish  diversity  is  described  in  Section 
2.4.2. 1  of  the  EIS. 

Shoreline-installation  and  site-preparation  activities  would  require  a  stormwater  pollution 
prevention  plan,  developed  as  part  of  the  New  Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System

(NJPDES)  stormwater  permit,  which  would  describe  best  management  practices  (BMPs)  to 
control  sedimentation  and  erosion  and  provide  stormwater  management.  Shoreline  structures 
would  be  hardened  to  protect  from  shoreline  erosion  using  placement  of  concrete  or  riprap 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Approximately  1  ac  of  open  water  would  be  filled  (average  width  of  fill 
would  be  10  ft)  due  to  placement  of  the  bulkhead  cap  and  sheeting  along  the  bulkhead 
shoreline  (PSEG  2014-TN4235). 

The  new  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  would  require  dredging  about  440,000  yd3  of 
sediment  to  lower  the  river  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  61  ac  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  An  additional 
0.05  ac  of  river  bottom  habitat  would  be  removed  for  installation  of  seven  20-ft-diameter  barge 
mooring  caissons.  Installation  of  a  new  intake  structure  would  require  dredging  of  about 
225,000  yd3  of  sediment  to  lower  the  river  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  31  ac  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 
Dredging,  grading,  and  backfilling  activities  would  be  required  for  installation  of  a  new  discharge 
structure;  approximately  0.2  ac  of  tidal  waters  would  be  affected  (PSEG  2014-TN4235).  As 
dredging  will  be  done  by  one  hydraulic  suction  dredge,  dredged  material  disposal  would  be  by 
direct  pipeline  to  Artificial  Island  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  No  maintenance  dredging  is  planned 
under  the  Department  of  the  Army  permit  application.  In  total,  approximately  92  ac  of  open 
water  habitat  would  be  permanently  affected  by  dredging,  which  would  occur  over  a  2-month 
period  (USACE  2015-TN4277). 

The  installation  of  the  barge  storage  and  unloading  facilities  as  well  as  the  intake  and  discharge 
structures  would  result  in  temporary  disturbances  to  the  aquatic  habitat  in  those  portions  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary.  An  increase  in  suspended  sediments  could  occur  during  dredging 
activities;  however,  PSEG  determined  that  due  to  the  natural  high  turbidity  of  the  Delaware 
Estuary  at  the  project  location,  any  increase  in  sedimentation  would  not  be  noticeable  (PSEG 
2015-TN4234).  PSEG  would  comply  with  NJDEP  and  USACE  permitting  regulations  regarding 
timing  and  duration  of  dredging  to  avoid  sensitive  aquatic  life  stage  development  or  spawning 
(e.g.,  the  current  USACE  work  window  to  avoid  dredge  activities  occurs  between  March  1  and 
June  30).  The  review  team  reviewed  a  recent  report  on  sediment  analysis  for  the  Delaware 
River  Basin  that  describes  sediment  samples  near  the  PSEG  Site  as  probably/potentially 
suitable  for  aquatic  habitat  restoration  projects  (DERSMPW  2013-TN4204).  Therefore, 
dredging  in  this  area  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  unlikely  to  introduce  adverse  exposure  from 
sediment  contaminants  to  nearby  aquatic  biota.  PSEG  proposes  to  use  a  hydraulic  suction 
dredge  to  further  minimize  increases  in  turbidity  and  sedimentation,  to  limit  the  duration  of 
dredging,  and  to  avoid  the  need  to  handle  dredged  material  twice  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  PSEG 
also  would  use  appropriate  BMPs  to  minimize  sedimentation  effects  as  required  for  Federal  and 
State  permitting.  Motile  invertebrates,  fish,  and  sea  turtles  might  swim  into  this  portion  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary,  but  they  would  be  able  to  swim  away  or  likely  would  avoid  the  area  due 
to  dredging  activity  and  noise  from  pile  driving  that  may  occur  simultaneously. 

Mobile  macroinvertebrates  in  this  area  might  be  able  to  occupy  adjacent  habitat  in  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary  as  the  species  composition  and  abundance  of  the  macroinvertebrate  community 
in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  site  are  similar  to  those  of  benthic  communities  in 
adjacent  benthic  areas  of  the  estuary.  Although  permanent  alteration  of  at  least  92  ac  of  river 
bottom  habitat  would  occur,  the  impacts  to  aquatic  communities  in  the  vicinity  are  expected  to 
be  minimal  as  benthic  organisms  would  begin  to  re-colonize  the  area  following  the  completion  of 
dredging  activities  (Wilber  and  Clarke  2007-TN4271).

2.3  Pile  Installation 

PSEG  estimated  acoustic  effects  from  representative  pile-driving  studies  to  determine  pile- 
installation  effects  on  aquatic  biota.  In-water  activities  included  daytime  installation  of  24-in. - 
wide  steel  sheeting  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  for  the  intake  structure  (650  sheet  piles),  the  haul 
road  bulkhead  (2,400  sheet  piles),  and  the  barge  unloading  facility  20-ft-diameter  caissons 
(1,200  sheet  piles)  with  a  vibratory  hammer.  Causeway  installation  would  also  occur  during  the 
daytime,  and  analysis  was  conducted  for  approximately  1 ,000  30-in. -square  concrete  piles 
using  an  impact  hammer  with  additional  cushioning  to  reduce  pile  head  damage  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4234)  (Table  2).  PSEG  used  the  NMFS  Pile  Driving  Calculations  spreadsheet  model 
(Caltrans  2013-TN4236)  to  calculate  isopleths  for  the  peak  sound  pressure  level  (SPLpeak), 
cumulative  sound  exposure  level  (SELCum),  and  behavioral  root  mean  square  sound  pressure 
level  (SPLrms)  using  specific  information  on  piles  such  as  installation  method,  number  of  piles, 
and  type  of  pile.  For  SPLpeak  and  SPLrms  noise  isopleth  estimates,  the  NMFS  model  can  apply  a 
default  transmission  loss  of  15  m  as  a  conservative  assumption  under  a  practical  spreading  loss 
model  that  considers  the  noise  attenuation  (transmission  loss)  when  site-specific  attenuation  is 
not  known  (PSEG  201 5-TN4234).  The  modeled  isopleths  for  SELCUm  account  for  the  number  of 
pile-driving  strikes  per  day,  and  the  number  of  piles  per  day  is  provided  in  Table  2.

The  criteria  for  fish  are  as  follows:  206  dB  re:  1  pPa  SPLpeak,  1 87  dB  re:  1  pPa2-s  SELCUm  for  fish  > 
2  cm,  1 83  dB  re:  1  pPa2-s  SELCUm  for  fish  <  2  cm,  and  1 50  dB  re:  1  pPa  SPLrms.  The 
determination  for  potential  onset  of  physical  injury  is  determined  by  exceedance  of  both  the 
peak  pressure  (SPLpeak)  and  cumulative  sound  exposure  level  (SELCUm).  A  determination  for 
potential  behavioral  effects  is  made  using  exceedance  of  the  root  mean  square  sound  pressure 
level  (SPLrms)  (Caltrans  2013-TN4236).  Distances  from  the  pile-driving  activity  that  exceed 
these  criteria  are  presented  in  Table  3.

Criteria  that  may  be  used  for  sea  turtles  are  as  follows:  onset  of  injury  from  impulsive  sound 
(pile  driving)  for  cetaceans  is  1 80  dB  re:  1  pPa  SPLrms  and  disruption  of  natural  behavior  from 
impulsive  sound  is  160  dB  re:  IpPa  SPLrms  (NMFS  2015-TN4273).  While  these  criteria  may  be 
used  conservatively  for  sea  turtles,  a  recent  study  used  a  190  dB  re:  IpPa  SPLrms  threshold  for 
onset  of  injury  in  sea  turtles  (NAVSEA  2013-TN4237). 

Based  on  the  NMFS  model,  the  206  dB  SPLpeak  is  only  exceeded  immediately  adjacent  to  pile- 
driving  activity  and  does  not  extend  1  m  out  except  for  causeway  installation.  The  exceedance 
distance  of  1 87/183  dB  SELCUm  for  fish,  which  is  similar  to  1 90/1 80  dB  SPLrms  for  sea  turtles,  for 
the  proposed  causeway  is  216/398  m  (709/1,306  ft);  however,  this  distance  extends  over  mostly 
vegetated  marsh  plain  and  shallow  marsh  creeks,  not  open  water  (Figure  4). 

The  behavioral  effects  criterion  of  150  dB  SPLrms  for  fish  is  exceeded  for  the  causeway  pile 
installation  up  to  1,166  m  (3,825  ft)  from  the  source,  which  is  mostly  vegetated  marsh  plain  and 
shallow  marsh  creeks  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  For  vibratory  shoreline  steel  sheet  pile  installation 
at  Artificial  Island,  caisson  installation,  and  intake  installation,  the  behavioral  effects  criterion 
exceedance  for  fish  extends  from  the  source  out  to  74  m  (243  ft)  into  the  Delaware  River 
(Figure  4),  which  could  also  be  a  conservative  estimate  for  sea  turtles  (criterion  of  160  dB 
SPLrms). 


As  a  comparison,  PSEG  also  assessed  vessel-related  sounds  for  large  container  transport 
ships  moving  at  22.7  knots  and  smaller  tugboats.  Both  vessel  types  have  a  small  behavioral 
exceedance  zone  for  fish — 349  m  (1 ,1 18  ft)  and  10.9  m  (36  ft),  respectively  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4234) — and  are  shown  on  Figure  4. 

2.4  Barge  Traffic 

Vessel  use  during  dredging  or  installation  of  the  in-water  structures  and  transportation  of 
building  materials  and  large  system  components  to  the  PSEG  Site  may  affect  the  aquatic 
resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  particularly  the  benthos  or  benthic  dwelling  organisms 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  main  impacts  of  using  vessels  would  include  turbulence  from 
propellers  (prop  wash),  collisions  with  aquatic  species,  and  accidental  spills  of  materials 
overboard.  PSEG  estimated  the  annual  number  of  vessel  trips  for  the  installation  activities 
correlated  to  the  activities  described  for  the  Department  of  Army  permit  to  be  between  247  and 
357.  This  is  an  incremental  increase  to  the  reported  annual  average  of  4,485  commercial 
vessel  trips  in  the  Delaware  River  and  Estuary  between  2007  and  2014  (PSEG  201 5-TN4234). 
PSEG  estimated  that  general  construction  materials  shipped  by  barge  over  a  3-  to  7-year 
period,  would  originate  at  the  Ports  of  Camden,  Philadelphia,  and  Salem,  and  use  shipping 
routes  in  the  Delaware  Bay  and  River  (USACE  2015-TN4281 ). 

The  NRC  review  team  determined  that  vessel  traffic  during  site-preparation  activities  would 
result  in  minimal  disturbance  to  benthic  habitats  associated  with  the  PSEG  Site  as  it  would 
occur  in  deeper  waters  associated  with  the  installation  of  piles  or  dredging  activities  and  should 
not  affect  the  general  resources  in  the  region  along  this  coast  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.

3.0  FEDERALLY  LISTED  SPECIES  CONSIDERED 

NMFS  (201 0-TN2171 )  identified  aquatic  species  under  its  jurisdiction  that  are  Federally  listed  as 
threatened  or  endangered  and  one  species  (i.e.,  Atlantic  Sturgeon  [Acipenser  oxyrinchus 
oxyrinchus ])  that  was  listed  as  a  candidate  species  that  may  occur  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  in  the  vicinity  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  By  2013,  the  Atlantic 
Sturgeon  was  updated  to  endangered,  and  an  updated  list  of  Federally  protected  species  near 
the  PSEG  Site  was  provided  by  NMFS  (2013-TN2804).  These  species  are  listed  in  Table  1. 

3.1  Sea  Turtle  Species  Known  to  Occur  Near  the  PSEG  Site 

Loggerhead  sea  turtles  ( Caretta  caretta)  are  historically  the  most  commonly  observed  sea  turtle 
species  in  the  vicinity  of  PSEG,  and  Kemp's  ridley  sea  turtles  ( Lepidochelys  kempii)  are  known 
to  occur  in  Delaware  Bay  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  (Eggers  1989-TN2778).  Three  Atlantic 
green  sea  turtles  ( Chelonia  mydas )  were  reported  at  the  SGS  intake  between  1980  and  1992 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  More  recently,  two  Kemp’s  ridley  turtles  were  reported  at  the  SGS 
intake  in  2013  (PSEG  2013-TN2690;  PSEG  2013-TN3137),  and  another  two  Kemp’s  ridley 
turtles  at  the  SGS  intake  in  2014  (PSEG  2015-TN4262).  Therefore,  these  three  sea  turtle 
species  are  considered  below  with  regard  to  site-preparation  effects  from  dredging,  pile 
installation,  and  barge  traffic. 

3.2  Sturgeon  Species  Known  to  Occur  Near  the  PSEG  Site 

The  Shortnose  Sturgeon  (Acipenser  brevirostrum)  and  the  Atlantic  Sturgeon  are  anadromous, 
primitive  bony  fish  that  occur  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  (NMFS  2013-TN2791;  NMFS  2012- 
TN2797).  The  Shortnose  Sturgeon  is  believed  to  spawn  earlier  in  the  year  than  Atlantic 
Sturgeon  species.  Shortnose  adults  begin  to  migrate  upstream  to  freshwater  in  the  winter, 
spend  most  of  the  winter  in  deep  waters  of  rivers  and  estuaries,  and  spawn  between  January 
and  mid-May  (Dadswell  et  al.  1984-TN2780).  Atlantic  Sturgeon  adults  migrate  upriver  later  in 
the  spring  to  spawn  (ASSRT  2007-TN2082;  Gilbert  1989-TN2149).  Juveniles  of  both  species 
feed  on  benthic  insects  and  crustaceans,  and  as  adults,  feed  on  mollusks  and  large  crustaceans 
(Shepherd  2006-TN2785;  NMFS  2012-TN2797). 

4.0  PROPOSED  ACTION  EFFECTS  ANALYSIS 

Site-preparation  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  that  would  be 
authorized  under  the  USACE  permitting  action  may  affect  Federally  listed  species  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  following  ways: 

1 .  dredging  activities  associated  with  a  new  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  and  the 
intake  structure 

2.  noise  generated  from  installation  of  piles  for  building  of  a  barge  facility,  causeway,  shoreline 
haul  road  bulkhead,  and  intake  structure 

3.  barge  traffic  during  building  activities  may  cause  localized  sedimentation  and  scouring,  or 
may  collide  with  protected  species.

4.1  Dredging 

PSEG  proposes  to  use  one  hydraulic  dredge  over  a  2-month  period  (USACE  2015-TN4277), 
which  would  serve  to  reduce  dredging  duration  and  handling  of  dredged  material  to  limit  the 
extent  of  impacts  on  aquatic  resources  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  Although  use  of  an 
environmental  hopper  dredge  may  be  less  likely  to  be  directly  injurious  to  fish  species,  this 
method  requires  a  longer  work  window,  increases  turbidity,  and  requires  additional  handling  of 
material  for  disposal.  Because  hydraulic  dredging  could  potentially  entrain  or  impinge  smaller 
sturgeon,  PSEG  would  adhere  to  the  seasonal  in-water  timing  restrictions  imposed  by  the 
USACE  (currently  March  1  through  June  30)  and  NJDEP  for  dredging  and  other  in-water  work 
to  avoid  sensitive  spawning  or  recruitment  windows  to  minimize  these  effects  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4234).  PSEG  did  not  detect  any  sturgeon  species  from  fish  sampling  in  the  areas  associated 
with  the  barge  unloading  facility  and  intake  (i.e.,  between  RKM  80  and  100)  between  2003  and 
2010  (PSEG  2015-TN4280);  however,  sturgeon  may  still  migrate  through  this  area. 

Some  dredging  will  likely  coincide  with  pile-driving  activities  previously  described,  and  thus 
discourage  sea  turtle  and  fish  species  from  foraging  in  the  immediate  area  (NMFS  2014- 
TN4239).  The  review  team  reviewed  a  recent  report  on  sediment  analysis  for  the  Delaware 
River  Basin  that  describes  sediment  samples  near  the  PSEG  Site  as  probably/potentially 
suitable  for  aquatic  habitat  restoration  projects  (DERSMPW  201 3-TN4204).  Therefore, 
dredging  in  this  area  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  unlikely  to  introduce  adverse  exposure  from 
sediment  contaminants  to  nearby  aquatic  biota.  An  increase  in  suspended  sediments  could 
occur  during  dredging  activities;  however,  PSEG  determined  that  due  to  the  natural  high 
turbidity  of  the  Delaware  Estuary  at  the  project  location,  any  increase  in  sedimentation  would 
not  be  noticeable  (PSEG  201 5-TN4234).  Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  in  these  areas  of  the 
Delaware  River  is  expected  to  be  minor  and  temporary,  due  to  use  of  hydraulic  dredge 
technology  and  compliance  with  USACE  and  NJDEP  work  window  requirements.  Sea  turtles, 
juvenile  and  adult  sturgeon,  and  their  prey  that  may  be  present  should  be  able  to  use  adjacent 
unaffected  habitats  during  dredge  activities.  Therefore,  adverse  effects  to  sea  turtles,  sturgeon, 
and  their  prey  from  dredging  operations  would  be  minor. 

4.2  Pile  Installation 

Sturgeon  and  sea  turtles  may  be  affected  by  noise  from  installation  of  piles.  In  addition, 
sturgeon  and  some  sea  turtles  rely  on  fish  prey  species  that  may  also  be  affected  by  pile- 
installation  noise.  PSEG  provided  an  analysis  using  criteria  accepted  by  NMFS  for  estimating 
exceedance  distances  to  determine  cumulative  sound  exposure  effect,  and  behavioral  adverse 
effects  to  fish  from  pile-driving  activities.  Figure  4  shows  the  areas  for  noise  effects  which  will 
occur  over  a  period  of  approximately  50  days  for  causeway  piling  installation,  10  days  for  intake 
structure  sheet  piles,  and  20  days  each  for  shoreline  and  caisson  sheet  pile  installation  (See 
Table  2)  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  While  sea  turtle  effects  were  not  specifically  assessed,  the 
exceedance  distances  provide  a  conservative  analysis  for  sea  turtle  for  injury  effect  and  adverse 
behavioral  effect.  Given  the  short  duration  of  activity  and  the  abundance  of  nearby,  adjacent 
unaffected  habitat,  it  is  likely  that  sturgeon,  sea  turtles,  and  their  mobile  prey  will  avoid  the 
zones  of  cumulative  sound  and  adverse  behavioral  effects  (NMFS  2014-TN4239).  Therefore, 
effects  to  sturgeon,  sea  turtles,  and  their  prey  from  pile-driving  activities  would  be  minor.

4.3  Barge  Traffic 

Disruption  of  habitat  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  from  sedimentation  and  scouring  due  to 
propeller  wash  is  expected  to  be  localized  and  temporary  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Sea  turtles 
and  sturgeon  species  likely  would  avoid  habitats  in  the  area  of  incoming  and  outgoing  barge 
traffic  and  could  find  unaffected  habitat  nearby  for  foraging  activities.  Vessels  for  site 
preparation  include  bulk  material  delivery  scow  barges  with  a  draft  of  1 1  ft  maximum  and  a 
speed  of  1  to  7  knots  (after  leaving  the  Federal  Navigation  Channel);  work  vessels  (e.g.,  barge, 
tugboat,  and  crane  barges)  with  drafts  ranging  from  6  to  10.5  ft;  and  dredges  with  a  maximum 
draft  of  10  ft  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  Bulk  material  scow  barges  (200  ft  long  by  35  ft  wide)  and 
some  work  craft  vessels  (up  to  300  ft  long  by  50  ft  wide)  would  be  used  following  completion  of 
the  barge  unloading  facility.  Dredge  depths  would  allow  for  at  least  2  feet  of  clearance  at  mean 
low  water  for  the  deepest  draft  vessels  at  the  barge  unloading  facility  and  transit  area  (PSEG 
201 5-TN4234).  Barges  used  for  dredging  (up  to  270  ft  long  by  65  ft  wide)  in  the  areas  for  the 
intake  and  barge  unloading  facility  would  use  a  slow  approach  speed  of  1  to  2  knots  within  500 
ft  of  the  dredge  area  and  would  not  significantly  increase  the  overall  traffic  volume  in  the 
Delaware  River;  therefore  these  barges  would  not  significantly  increase  the  probability  of  sea 
turtle  or  sturgeon  collisions.  A  recent  Biological  Opinion  written  for  the  Tappan  Zee  Bridge 
Replacement  Project  in  the  Hudson  River  concluded  that  vessels  with  a  draft  of  less  than  15  ft 
(e.g.,  construction  barges  and  scows)  reduce  the  likelihood  of  sturgeon  strikes  and  are  expected 
to  have  low  vessel-related  mortality  (NMFS  2014-TN4239). 

5.0  CUMULATIVE  EFFECTS  ANALYSIS 

Cumulative  effects,  as  defined  in  50  CFR  402.02  (TN4312),  are  those  effects  of  future  State  or 
private  activities,  not  involving  Federal  activities,  which  are  reasonably  certain  to  occur  within 
the  action  area.  Future  Federal  actions  are  not  considered  in  the  definition  of  cumulative 
effects.  Other  actions  in  the  vicinity  that  have  reasonably  foreseeable  future  impacts  on  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  include  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HOGS,  continued 
recreational  and  commercial  fishing,  continued  water  use  and  discharge  by  other  power- 
producing  plants  and  wastewater  facilities,  and  potential  construction  of  a  new  transmission 
corridor  and  transmission  line  by  PJM  Interconnection,  LLC,  for  grid  stability.  Planning  and 
development  for  the  new  transmission  corridor  would  avoid  or  span  channelized  waterways, 
perennial  streams,  and  intermittent  streams  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Development  for  new 
transmission  line  crossings  would  require  BMPs  to  protect  water  quality  and  minimize  effects  to 
aquatic  habitats  that  may  be  at  risk  from  clearing  activities,  runoff,  and  bank  erosion.  An 
estimated  77,088  linear  ft  of  stream  habitat  (S&L  2010-TN2671 )  is  within  the  5-mi-wide  macro¬ 
corridor  for  the  hypothetical  transmission  line  discussed  in  Sections  7.1  and  7.3.2  of  the  EIS. 

The  hypothetical  transmission  line  would  cross  the  Delaware  River  and  would  require 
installation  of  footings.  Placement  of  footings  would  result  in  permanent  benthic  habitat  loss, 
but  this  loss  would  be  minimal  when  compared  to  available  adjacent  habitat.  Installation 
activities  would  be  managed  through  use  of  BMPs  required  for  Federal  and  State  permitting  to 
minimize  siltation  and  protect  adjacent  aquatic  habitats.  PSEG  would  consult  with  Federal  and 
State  agencies,  as  required,  when  an  exact  route  is  identified  and  installation  effects  to 
protected  species  can  be  directly  assessed  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

Water  quality  in  the  region  may  be  affected  by  continued  withdrawal  and  discharge  of  water  to 
support  power  generation.  Large  commercial  and  recreational  fisheries  harvest  fish  and 
invertebrates  that  make  up  the  ecological  community  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  In 
addition,  the  effects  of  natural  environmental  stressors  (e.g.,  climate  change  and  extreme 
weather  events)  would  affect  aquatic  communities  in  the  region. 

Boat  hull  collisions  and  entrainment  through  propellers  from  vessel  traffic  in  the  Delaware  River 
and  Estuary  are  a  significant  source  of  anthropogenic  sturgeon  mortality.  Brown  and  Murphy 
(2010-TN4274)  examined  the  prevalence  of  these  vessel  strike  mortalities  between  2005  and 
2008  and  determined  that  14  of  the  total  28  Atlantic  Sturgeon  mortalities  in  the  Delaware 
Estuary  had  injuries  consistent  with  vessel  strike.  Brown  and  Murphy  (2010-TN4274)  further 
concluded  that  any  increase  in  mortality  to  Atlantic  Sturgeon  females  may  have  significant 
effects  on  future  population  recovery  of  all  DPS  groups  and  recruitment  due  to  the  slow 
maturation  rate  of  the  species. 

Each  of  the  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  may  influence  the  structure  and  function  of 
estuarine  food  webs  and  result  in  observable  changes  to  the  aquatic  resources  in  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary.  In  most  cases,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  quantitatively  the  impact  of 
individual  stressors  or  groups  of  stressors  on  aquatic  resources  because  they  affect  the  region 
simultaneously,  and  their  effects  are  cumulative. 

5.1  Continued  Operation  of  the  SGS  Once-Through  Cooling  System 

Based  on  the  assessment  presented  in  the  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for 
License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants — Supplement  45  Regarding  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station 
and  Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2— Final  Report  (NRC  201 1 -TN31 31 ),  NRC 
staff  concluded  that  “entrainment,  impingement,  and  thermal  discharge  impacts  on  aquatic 
resources  from  the  operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  collectively  have  not  had  a  noticeable 
adverse  effect  on  the  balanced  indigenous  community  of  the  Delaware  Estuary.”  However, 
operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  continues  to  impinge  and  entrain  aquatic  species  and  would 
contribute,  in  part,  to  the  cumulative  loss  of  these  species  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

Several  improvements  to  the  cooling  water  intake  structures  have  been  made  to  reduce 
impingement  mortality  at  SGS.  Some  of  these  improvements  included  installation  of  modified 
traveling  screens,  installation  of  improved  screen  mesh,  and  modifications  to  spray  wash  nozzle 
configurations  (PSEG  2009-TN2513).  Decades  of  monitoring  and  survey  data  for  finfish  and 
aquatic  invertebrates  have  been  used  to  assess  species  density  and  richness  in  the  vicinity  of 
SGS  as  directed  under  NJPDES  permits  starting  in  1994  and  in  subsequent  renewals 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Impingement,  entrainment,  and  fish  assemblage  sampling  by  trawling 
and  seining  are  conducted  each  year,  in  accordance  with  NJPDES  permit  requirements  for 
biological  monitoring.  The  reporting  emphasis  is  on  targeted  representative  important  species 
that  include  Blueback  Herring  ( Alosa  aestivalis ),  Alewife  (A  pseudoharengus),  American  Shad 
(A  sapidissima),  Atlantic  Menhaden  ( Brevoortia  tyrannus),  Bay  Anchovy  ( Anchoa  mitchi/li), 
Atlantic  Silverside  ( Menidia  menidia ),  White  Perch  ( Morone  americana ),  Striped  Bass  (M. 
saxatilis ),  Bluefish  ( Pomatomus  saltatrix ),  Weakfish  (Cynoscion  regalis),  Spot  ( Leiostomus 
xanthurus),  and  Atlantic  Croaker  ( Micropogonias  undulatus)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  All  of  these 
representative  important  species  are  considered  either  recreationally  or  commercially  important 
or  are  ecologically  important  as  forage  fish  for  sustainability  of  the  ecosystem  within  the

Delaware  River  Estuary.  They  are  discussed  in  more  detail  in  Section  2. 4. 2. 3  of  the  EIS. 
Although  individual  species  abundances  change  year  to  year,  the  overall  trends  in  community 
abundances  and  diversity  show  no  significant  changes  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

5.2  Continued  Operation  of  the  HCGS  Closed-Cycle  Cooling  System 

HCGS  uses  closed-cycle  cooling  and  therefore  requires  substantially  less  water  volume  for 
cooling  operations  (i.e.,  a  maximum  of  66,000  gpm  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary). 
Accordingly,  effects  on  the  aquatic  community  through  impingement,  entrainment,  and 
discharge  also  are  expected  to  be  reduced  when  compared  with  the  once-through  cooling 
system  at  SGS  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ).  Impingement  studies  at  HCGS  were  performed  only  in 
1 986  and  1 987  at  the  commencement  of  operation  for  the  single  unit  and  showed  a  reduced 
overall  impingement  rate  when  compared  to  SGS  (see  EIS  Section  5.3.2).  Because  HCGS  was 
operating  concurrently  with  SGS,  the  NJPDES  permit-directed  biological  monitoring  of  the 
aquatic  community  through  trawling  and  seining  studies  also  reflected  the  combined  effect  of 
both  HCGS  and  SGS  operations.  Therefore,  the  conclusions  regarding  the  effect  of  continued 
operation  of  SGS  also  apply  to  HCGS  in  that  the  overall  species  diversity  and  community 
abundances  near  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  continue  to  show  no  noticeable  effects  from 
operations  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ). 

5.3  SGS  and  HCGS  Effects  on  Protected  Species 

Coordination  pursuant  to  section  7  of  the  ESA  regarding  the  nearby  SGS  and  HCGS  has  been 
ongoing  between  the  NRC  and  NMFS  since  1979.  In  1980,  NMFS  issued  a  Biological  Opinion 
that  concluded  that  the  continued  operation  of  these  facilities  was  not  likely  to  jeopardize  the 
Shortnose  Sturgeon  and  set  a  take  limit  of  up  to  1 1  Shortnose  Sturgeon  per  year  at  SGS.  Sea 
turtles  were  not  included  in  the  1980  Biological  Opinion. 

The  NRC  reinitiated  consultation  on  August  19,  1988,  because  SGS  had  impinged  a  number  of 
sea  turtles.  NMFS  issued  a  revised  Biological  Opinion  on  January  2,  1991,  to  include  sea 
turtles.  In  this  Biological  Opinion,  NMFS  concluded  that  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS 
would  affect  sea  turtles  but  would  not  jeopardize  the  continued  existence  of  any  populations  of 
threatened  or  endangered  species.  The  1991  Biological  Opinion  also  reduced  the  number  of 
allowable  Shortnose  Sturgeon  takes  based  on  actual  levels  of  impingement  at  SGS  and  HCGS 
up  to  that  point. 

NMFS  modified  the  1991  Biological  Opinion  on  August  4,  1992,  to  increase  the  total  allowable 
take  limit  for  loggerheads  and  Shortnose  Sturgeon.  However,  between  June  and  October  1992, 
SGS  and  HCGS  exceeded  their  take  limit  for  Kemp’s  ridley  mortalities  and  met  their  take  limit 
for  Shortnose  Sturgeon  mortalities.  NMFS  issued  another  Biological  Opinion  on  May  14,  1993 
(PSEG  1999-TN2787),  which  did  not  change  the  take  limits  of  listed  species  but  specified  that 
SGS  and  HCGS  should  develop  a  research  program  using  mark/recapture  to  determine 
whether  SGS  has  features  that  attract  sea  turtles.  Also  in  1993,  PSEG  implemented  a  policy  of 
removing  the  ice  barriers  from  the  trash  racks  on  the  intake  structure  between  May  1  and 
October  24,  which  resulted  in  substantially  lower  turtle  impingement  rates  at  SGS.

Appendix  F 


The  NRC  reinitiated  section  7  consultation  in  1998  to  remove  the  study  requirement  from  the 
SGS  and  HCGS  Incidental  Take  Statement.  The  NRC  cited  the  change  in  PSEG  procedure 
regarding  removal  of  ice  barriers  during  the  spring  and  summer.  In  response,  NMFS  issued  a 
revised  Biological  Opinion  on  January  21,  1999,  that  removed  the  study  requirement  and 
decreased  the  number  of  annual  allowable  takes  of  Shortnose  Sturgeon  from  10  individuals  to  5 
individuals  based  on  the  review  of  Shortnose  Sturgeon  capture  rates  at  SGS  and  HCGS.  The 
Biological  Opinion  also  formalized  ice  barrier  removal  from  May  1  through  October  24  by 
making  it  a  requirement  in  the  “Terms  and  Conditions”  section  of  the  Biological  Opinion.  To 
implement  the  1999  Biological  Opinion,  PSEG  developed  associated  guidance  documents, 
Biological  Opinion  Compliance  and  Species  Management  (PSEG  1999-TN2787). 

NMFS  issued  a  new  Biological  Opinion  in  2014  for  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS 
under  the  terms  of  the  facilities’  renewed  licenses  (NMFS  2014-TN4238).  The  2014  Biological 
Opinion  allows  for  the  incidental  take  of  all  five  DPSs  of  Atlantic  Sturgeon  at  SGS  Units  1  and  2 
trash  bars  and  intake  screens  and  revises  incidental  take  limits  for  sea  turtles  and  Shortnose 
Sturgeon  (Table  4).

The  “Terms  and  Conditions”  section  of  the  Biological  Opinion  requires  PSEG  to  report  all 
incidental  takes  to  NMFS  within  30  days  of  the  take  and  to  include  appropriate  documentation  in 
the  report.  In  addition,  the  “Terms  and  Conditions”  section  details  a  number  of  requirements  for 
sea  turtle  resuscitation,  live  sea  turtle  inspection,  dead  sea  turtle  necropsy  reports,  and  sturgeon 
tagging  and  inspection. 

Between  1 992  and  2001 ,  1 6  loggerhead  turtles  were  stranded  at  SGS  (NRC  201 0-TN281 1 ).  No 
loggerhead  turtles  have  been  impinged  since  2001  (NMFS  2014-TN4238).  Only  two  Atlantic 
green  turtles  have  been  captured  at  SGS  since  it  began  operations — one  in  1991  (alive)  and 
one  in  1992  (dead)  (NMFS  2014-TN4238).  In  1992,  two  live  and  two  dead  Kemp’s  ridley  sea 
turtles  were  found  at  the  SGS  cooling  water  intake;  the  cause  of  mortality  was  not  reported 
(PSEG  1992-TN3173).  In  1993,  a  live  Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtle  was  found  at  the  SGS  cooling 
water  intake  (PSEG  1999-TN2787).  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  in  1993  reduced 
the  likelihood  of  additional  turtle  strandings;  however,  two  Kemp’s  ridley  turtles  were  stranded  at 
SGS  in  2013  (PSEG  2013-TN2690;  PSEG  2013-TN3137)  and  two  more  in  2014  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4262).  Table  5  summarizes  incidental  takes  of  sea  turtle  and  sturgeon  species  at  SGS 
between  2000  and  2015.

Since  2000,  7  live  and  11  dead  Shortnose  Sturgeon  have  been  collected  on  SGS  intake 
structures  (PSEG  2000-TN3150;  PSEG  2003-TN3149;  PSEG  2004-TN3144;  PSEG  2007-

Atlantic  Sturgeon  were  not  reported  at  the  SGS  intake  screens  until  after  this  species  was 
considered  for  listing  as  a  Federally  endangered  species,  and  are  reported  here  since  2012. 
NMFS  revised  the  Biological  Opinion  in  2014  to  include  Atlantic  Sturgeon  (NMFS  2014-

SGS  Units  1  and  2,  although  there  may  be  incidental  take  of  the  other  four  DPSs.  Between 
2012  and  May  31,  2015,  24  live  and  15  dead  Atlantic  Sturgeon  were  reported  at  the  SGS  intake

5.4  Commercial  and  Recreational  Harvest  of  Fish  and  Shellfish 

The  Delaware  River  Estuary  supports  a  diverse  commercial  and  recreational  fishery  for  finfish 
and  invertebrates.  Losses  to  the  ecosystem  from  fishery  harvest  are  managed  at  the  Federal 
and  State  levels  through  catch  limits,  regulations  on  fishing  gear,  and  seasonal  closures. 
Unintended  harvest  or  mortality  is  another  source  of  loss  through  bycatch  while  targeting  a 
different  species.  These  activities  have  the  potential  to  contribute  to  cumulative  effects  on 
aquatic  species  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  However,  the  direct  contribution  is  difficult  to 
assess  because  many  of  these  fish  populations  have  life  histories  that  involve  a  large  migratory 
territory  offshore  and  along  the  Atlantic  coast  of  the  United  States,  and  therefore,  effects  to 
populations  are  difficult  to  directly  attribute  to  Delaware  River  Estuary  habitat  effects. 

5.5  Habitat  Loss  and  Restoration 

Future  land-use  development  for  industry,  agriculture,  or  other  habitat  alterations  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  watershed  may  affect  water  quality.  These  types  of  activities  may  also 
result  in  shoreline  habitat  loss.  While  aquatic  habitats  continue  to  be  affected  by  natural  and 
anthropogenic  activities  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  efforts  to  restore  salt  marsh  and  estuary 
habitat  have  met  with  some  success  and  are  expected  to  continue  in  the  future.  For  example, 
ongoing  restoration  activities  within  the  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA,  located  4  mi  east  of  the  PSEG 
Site,  would  restore  nearly  200  ac  of  the  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  to  address  injuries  to  shoreline 
and  bird  resources  resulting  from  the  2004  Athos  / oil  spill  (NOAA  2008-TN2721 ).  NJDEP  and 
the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  proposed  a  tidal  wetland  restoration 
project  that  would  allow  development  of  smooth  cordgrass  ( Spartina  alterniflora )  habitat  to 
improve  habitat  quality  in  the  area.  Restoration  would  be  accomplished  through  fill  material 
removal  to  lower  the  marsh  elevation  and  allow  tidal  inundation  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  As 
described  in  EIS  Section  4.3.1,  unavoidable  impacts  to  wetlands  during  site-preparation 
activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  mitigated  by  habitat 
restoration  and  enhancement,  using  experience  and  proven  techniques  developed  by  the  PSEG 
Estuary  Enhancement  Program  (EEP).  Sensitive  species  that  utilize  such  marsh  habitats  would 
be  affected  positively  by  the  proposed  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  restoration  effort  and  by  the 
proposed  mitigation  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  causeway  (i.e., 
restoration  of  low  quality  marsh  habitats)  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

5.6  Climate  Change 

The  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  aquatic  organisms  and  habitat  in  the  geographic 
area  of  interest  are  not  precisely  known.  In  addition  to  rising  sea  levels,  climate  change  could 
lead  to  regional  increases  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  precipitation  events, 
increases  in  annual  precipitation,  and  increases  in  average  temperature  (GCRP  2014-TN3472). 
Such  changes  in  climate  could  alter  aquatic  community  composition  on  or  near  the  PSEG  Site 
through  changes  in  species  diversity,  abundance,  and  distribution.  In  2012,  Hurricane  Sandy 
created  increased  storm  surge  during  this  event  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  had 
moderate  effects  on  water  quality  and  coastal  habitats  within  the  southernmost  portion  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  through  erosion,  sedimentation,  and  resuspension  of  contaminants 
within  sediments  (ALS  2012-TN2720).  Elevated  water  temperatures,  droughts,  and  severe 
weather  phenomena  could  adversely  affect  or  severely  reduce  aquatic  habitat;  however,

Appendix  F 


specific  predictions  on  aquatic  habitat  changes  in  this  region  due  to  climate  change  are 
inconclusive  at  this  time.  The  level  of  impact  resulting  from  these  events  would  depend  on  the 
intensity  of  the  perturbation  and  the  resiliency  of  the  aquatic  communities.  The  Delaware  River 
Basin  Commission  (DRBC)  stated  in  the  State  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  report  for  2013  that 
increases  in  temperature  and  salinity  are  expected  with  future  sea-level  rise  and  climate  change 
(DRBC  2013-TN2609).  These  potential  changes  are  likely  to  result  in  movement  of  populations 
of  more  marine  and  euryhaline  species  farther  up  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  For  example,  in 
a  recent  report,  hard  bottom  areas  north  and  south  of  the  Chesapeake  and  Delaware  Canal 
(upriver  of  the  PSEG  Site)  were  identified  as  having  potential  as  reef  sites  for  the  establishment 
of  new  oyster  beds  and  were  discussed  as  a  future  conservation  target  due  to  changing  climate 
conditions  resulting  in  increases  in  salinity  farther  upriver  (PDE  201 1-TN2190). 

5.7  Summary  of  Cumulative  Effects 

Aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  will  be  cumulatively  affected  to  varying 
degrees  by  multiple  activities  and  processes  that  are  likely  to  occur  in  the  future.  The  food  web 
and  the  abundance  of  important  aquatic  forage  species  and  other  species  may  be  affected  by 
these  stressors  associated  with  human  activities,  but  can  be  addressed  by  management  actions 
(e.g.,  cooling  system  operation,  regulation  of  fishing  pressure,  water  quality  improvements,  and 
habitat  restoration). 

Other  stressors,  such  as  climate  change  and  increased  human  population  and  associated 
development  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  cannot  be  directly  managed,  and  their  effects  are 
more  difficult  to  quantify  and  predict.  It  is  likely,  however,  that  future  anthropogenic  and  natural 
environmental  stressors  would  cumulatively  affect  the  aquatic  community  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  sufficiently  that  they  would  noticeably  alter  important  attributes,  such  as  species  ranges, 
populations,  diversity,  habitats,  and  ecosystem  processes,  just  as  they  have  in  the  past.  These 
stressors  have  modified  important  attributes  of  aquatic  resources  and  would  continue  to  exert 
an  influence  in  the  future,  potentially  destabilizing  some  of  the  attributes  of  the  aquatic 
ecosystem.  Based  on  these  observations,  the  review  team  concludes  that  cumulative  effects 
may  be  noticeable  for  some  aquatic  resources,  primarily  based  on  future  use  and  climate 
change  affecting  aquatic  resources  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin. 

Cumulative  effects  on  aquatic  ecology  resources  are  estimated  based  on  the  information 
provided  by  PSEG,  NMFS,  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review.  Future  operation  of  SGS 
and  HCGS  will  continue  to  have  effects  on  the  aquatic  resources  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary; 
however,  the  PSEG  EEP  as  a  form  of  mitigation  may  reduce  the  overall  impacts  to  the  aquatic 
ecosystems  in  the  area.  The  review  team  concludes  that  the  incremental  contribution  of  the 
site-preparation  activities  for  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  negligible. 

6.0  CONCLUSION  AND  DETERMINATION  OF  EFFECTS 

Site-preparation  activities  associated  with  dredging,  pile  installation,  and  barge  traffic  may 
temporarily  affect  ESA  protected  species  and  their  prey  species  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of 
those  activities.  These  activities  would  be  permissible  under  Department  of  the  Army  and 
NJDEP  authorizations,  but  would  not  be  authorized  under  an  NRC  ESP.  Installation  of  cooling 
water  intake  structures,  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility,  shoreline  haul  road  bulkhead,

NUREG-2168 


F-139 


Appendix  F 


and  a  5-mi  causeway  may  cause  increased  siltation  and  disturbance  of  benthic  habitats,  and 
produce  intermittent  noise  from  installation  activities  that  could  affect  protected  species  and  their 
prey.  In  addition,  there  will  be  an  increase  in  barge  vessel  use  and  traffic  in  the  area  of  these 
site-preparation  activities.  However,  Federal  and  State  permitting  requires  BMPs  associated 
with  minimization  practices  (e.g.,  restricted  activity  windows  and  dredge  technologies)  that 
minimize  the  potential  for  adverse  impacts  to  protected  species. 

Dredging  and  installation  of  barge  unloading  facility,  shoreline  bulkhead  for  a  haul  road,  and 
intake  structures  would  be  permissible  under  a  Department  of  the  Army  and  NJDEP 
authorization,  but  not  authorized  under  an  NRC  ESP,  and  would  occur  in  a  portion  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  that  is  used  by  sea  turtles  and  anadromous  fish.  Installation  activities 
are  expected  to  be  temporary  and  localized,  and  any  increase  in  siltation  would  be  negligible 
given  the  high  turbidity  in  these  areas.  The  presence  of  any  of  the  species  described  in  this 
document  within  the  installation  area  may  occur,  although  these  species  should  be  able  to 
migrate  around  the  dredge  areas  and  forage  in  adjacent,  unaffected  habitat. 

Noise  effects  from  pile-driving  activities  may  induce  behavioral  modifications  that  deter  sea 
turtles  and  sturgeon  from  migrating  or  foraging  in  the  areas  affected  by  pile-driving  activities 
(NMFS  2014-TN4239).  However,  the  duration  of  pile  installation  will  be  brief  and  PSEG  would 
comply  with  USACE  and  NJDEP  requirements  to  avoid  work  during  seasons  deemed  critical  for 
protected  species  (PSEG  2015-TN4234). 

Any  increase  in  barge  traffic  and  use  for  site-preparation  activities  is  not  expected  to  be 
noticeable  given  the  annual  barge  traffic  reported  for  the  Delaware  Estuary.  In  addition,  vessels 
approaching  the  in-water  work  areas  or  PSEG  barge  unloading  facility  would  have  slower 
approach  speeds  of  1  to  2  knots  within  500  ft  of  these  areas  (PSEG  2015-TN4234). 

The  review  team  has  determined  that  site-preparation  activities  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  as  described  herein  and  included  in  Department  of  the  Army  permit  application 
number  CENAP-OP-R-2009-01 57-45  may  affect,  but  are  not  likely  to  adversely  affect, 

Atlantic  Sturgeon  from  the  New  York  Bight,  Gulf  of  Maine,  Chesapeake  Bay,  South  Atlantic,  and 
Carolina  DPSs;  Shortnose  Sturgeon;  the  Northwest  Atlantic  DPS  of  loggerhead  sea  turtles; 
green  sea  turtle;  and  Kemp’s  ridley  sea  turtle.

Two  versions  of  the  NMFS  EFHA  are  on  display  in  this  section.  The  first  version  (dated  June 
2014)  is  the  EFHA  originally  sent  by  the  NRC  to  the  NMFS  for  review.  This  is  the  same  version 
of  the  EFHA  that  was  on  display  in  Section  F.3.2  of  the  draft  EIS.  Following  the  issuance  of  the 
draft  EIS,  comments  were  received  from  NMFS  (see  Section  E.2.10  of  Appendix  E)  on  the  June 
2014  version  of  the  EFHA. 

The  second  version  of  the  NMFS  EFHA  (dated  August  2015)  on  display  in  this  section  is  a 
supplement  to  the  original  EFHA.  This  supplemental  EFHA  incorporates  the  review  team’s 
responses  to  the  comments  received  from  the  NMFS  on  the  June  2014  version.

Essential  Fish  Habitat  Assessment  for  the  PSEG  Site 
Early  Site  Permit  Application 


1.0  INTRODUCTION 

In  compliance  with  Section  305(b)(2)  of  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and 
Management  Act  (MSA),  as  amended  by  the  Sustainable  Fisheries  Act  of  1996  (16  USC  1801- 
TN1061),  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  review  team  prepared  this  essential 
fish  habitat  (EFH)  assessment  for  the  proposed  Federal  action:  NRC  issuance  of  an  early  site 
permit  (ESP)  for  a  site  (the  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  [PSEG]  Site)  located 
adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem  Generating  Station 
Units  1  and  2  (SGS)  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  on  the 
eastern  shore  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

Pursuant  to  the  MSA,  the  review  team  requested  via  letter  dated  October  26,  2010,  that  the 
National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  provide  information  on  EFH  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
PSEG  Site  (NRC  2010-TN2203).  In  their  response  to  the  NRC  dated  December  9,  2010,  NMFS 
indicated  that  the  estuarine  portions  of  the  Delaware  River  and  its  tributaries  contain  designated 
EFH  for  a  number  of  species  and  directed  the  NRC  to  prepare  an  EFH  assessment  as  part  of 
the  EFH  consultation  process  (NMFS  2010-TN2171).  Another  request  was  sent  to  NMFS  dated 
July  31 , 2013,  to  confirm  designated  EFH  for  the  species  provided  in  the  December  9,  2010, 
NMFS  letter,  or  to  provide  an  updated  EFH  species  list  (NRC  201 3-TN2805).  A  slightly  revised 
list  of  species  with  designated  EFH  was  received  from  NMFS  (PNNL  2013-TN2687; 

NMFS  2013-TN2804). 

Accordingly,  this  EFH  assessment  describes  the  proposed  action,  identifies  relevant 
commercially,  Federally  managed  species  within  the  vicinity  of  the  proposed  action  site, 
assesses  whether  the  proposed  action  may  adversely  affect  any  designated  EFH,  and 
describes  potential  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  or  offset  potential  adverse  impacts  to  EFH  as 
a  result  of  the  proposed  action.  This  assessment  also  considers  the  recent  EFH  assessment 
prepared  for  relicensing  of  SGS  and  HCGS  (NRC  201 1-TN261 1 ). 

2.0  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  PROPOSED  ACTION 

The  proposed  NRC  Federal  action  is  the  issuance,  under  the  provisions  of  Title  10  of  the  Code 
of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  52  (10  CFR  52-TN251),  of  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG  Site  for 
nuclear  power  facilities  with  characteristics  that  fall  within  the  plant  parameter  envelope.  An 
ESP  is  NRC  approval  of  a  site  or  sites  for  one  or  more  nuclear  power  facilities.  Issuance  of  an 
ESP  is  a  process  that  is  separate  from  the  issuance  of  a  construction  permit  (CP),  an  operating 
license  (OL),  or  a  combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (COL)  for  such  a  facility. 
The  ESP  application  and  review  process  makes  it  possible  to  evaluate  and  resolve  safety  and 
environmental  issues  related  to  siting  before  the  applicant  makes  a  large  commitment  of 
resources.  If  the  ESP  is  approved,  the  applicant  can  “bank”  the  site  for  up  to  20  years  for  future 
reactor  siting  and  can  conduct  certain  site  preparation  and  preliminary  construction  activities 
enumerated  in  10  CFR  50.10  (e)(1)  (10  CFR  50-TN249).  An  ESP  does  not,  however,  authorize 
construction  and  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant.  To  construct  and  operate  a  nuclear  power

plant,  an  ESP  holder  must  obtain  a  CP  and  an  OL,  or  a  COL,  which  are  separate  major  Federal 
actions  that  require  their  own  environmental  reviews  in  accordance  with  10  CFR  Part  51  (10 
CFR  51-TN250).  An  applicant  for  a  CP  or  COL  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  to  be  located  at  a 
site  for  which  an  ESP  has  been  issued  may  reference  the  ESP,  and  matters  resolved  in  the 
ESP  proceeding  are  considered  resolved  in  any  subsequent  proceeding  absent  the 
identification  of  new  and  significant  information. 

PSEG  is  seeking  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG  Site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS. 

As  part  of  its  review  of  the  ESP  application,  the  NRC  is  preparing  an  environmental  impact 
statement  (EIS)  as  required  by  Title  1 0  of  CFR  Part  51 ,  the  NRC  regulations  that  implement  the 
National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969,  as  amended.  The  EIS  will  include  an  analysis  of 
pertinent  environmental  issues,  including  endangered  and  threatened  species  and  impacts  to 
fish  and  wildlife. 

The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  is  participating  as  a  cooperating  agency  with  the 
NRC  in  preparing  the  EIS  and  participates  collaboratively  on  the  review  team.  Upon  issuance  of 
the  draft  EIS,  PSEG  plans  to  submit  a  Federal  and  a  State  application  to  the  USACE  and  the 
New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  for  the  Alteration  of  Any 
Floodplains,  Waterways,  or  Tidal  or  Nontidal  Wetlands  in  New  Jersey.  The  USACE  application 
number,  the  NJDEP  Tidal  Application  number,  and  the  NJDEP  Nontidal  Application  number  all 
will  be  included  in  the  final  EIS.  The  final  EIS  will  be  issued  after  considering  public  comments 
on  the  draft  EIS.  The  USACE  permit  action  on  a  Department  of  the  Army  individual  permit 
application  pursuant  to  Section  404  of  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act  (Clean  Water  Act; 
33  USC  1251-TN662)  and  Section  10  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Appropriation  Act  of  1899  (33 
USC  403-TN660)  will  be  made  following  issuance  of  the  final  EIS. 

2.1  Site  Location  and  Description 

The  PSEG  Site  lies  on  Artificial  Island,  directly  north  of  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  located  on 
the  east  bank  of  the  Delaware  River  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey,  at  which  point  the  river  is  approximately  2.5  mi  (4  km)  wide.  Artificial  Island  is  a  human- 
made  island  approximately  1,500  ac  (600  ha)  in  size  that  consists  of  tidal  marsh  and  grassland. 
The  USACE  created  the  island  in  the  20th  century  by  the  deposition  of  hydraulically  dredged 
material  atop  a  natural  sand  bar  that  projected  into  the  river.  The  average  elevation  of  the 
island  is  about  9  ft  (3  m)  above  mean  sea  level  (MSL)  with  a  maximum  elevation  of 
approximately  18  ft  (5.5  m)  above  MSL  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  The  site  is  located 
approximately  17  mi  (27  km)  south  of  the  Delaware  Memorial  Bridge;  35  mi  (56  km)  southwest 
of  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania;  and  8  mi  (1 3  km)  southwest  of  the  City  of  Salem,  New  Jersey 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Figure  1  shows  the  location  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  areas  within  a  6- 
mi  (10-km)  radius  and  50-mi  (80-km)  radius  of  the  facility. 

PSEG  owns  approximately  740  ac  (300  ha)  at  the  southern  end  of  the  Artificial  Island,  of  which 
SGS  occupies  approximately  220  ac  (89  ha)  and  HCGS  occupies  about  153  ac  (62  ha).  PSEG 
is  developing  an  agreement  in  principle  with  the  USACE  to  acquire  an  additional  85  ac  of  the 
USACE’s  Confined  Disposal  Facility  (CDF)  land  immediately  north  of  HCGS.  Figures  2  and  3 
provide  a  context  for  the  site  in  relation  to  nearby  water  bodies  and  a  plan  view  of  the  proposed 
site  layout  for  PSEG,  respectively.  The  region  within  15  mi  (24  km)  of  the  site  is  primarily  used

for  agriculture.  The  area  also  includes  numerous  parks,  wildlife  refuges,  and  preserves  such  as 
Mad  Horse  Creek  Wildlife  Management  Area  (WMA)  to  the  east;  Cedar  Swamp  State  WMA  to 
the  south  in  Delaware;  Appoquinimink,  Silver  Run,  and  Augustine  State  WMAs  to  the  west  in 
Delaware;  and  Supawna  Meadows  National  Wildlife  Refuge  to  the  north  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2.1.1  Delaware  River  Estuary 

The  Delaware  River  and  Delaware  Bay  are  a  part  of  the  larger  Delaware  Estuary  and  River 
Basin  that  extends  from  headwaters  in  New  York  to  the  coastal  plains  near  Cape  Henlopen  in 
Delaware  (PDE  201 2-TN21 91 ).  The  Delaware  Bay  extends  from  the  confluence  of  the 
Delaware  River  with  the  Atlantic  Ocean  from  Delaware  River  Mile  (RM)  0  to  RM  54  (River 
Kilometer  [RKM]  0  to  RKM  86.9).  The  Delaware  River  Estuary  includes  the  Delaware  Bay  and 
extends  up  the  tidal  Delaware  River,  which  is  characterized  by  brackish  water  between 
Delaware  RM  54  and  RM  80  (RKM  86.9  and  RKM  128.8)  and  becomes  freshwater  at  Delaware 
RM  80  (BBL  and  Integral  2007-TN2126).  The  PSEG  Site  near  the  mouth  of  Alloway  Creek  is  at 
Delaware  RM  52  (DRBC  201 1-TN2412)  and  is  considered  to  be  in  the  lower  estuary  watershed 
unit  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  (PDE  2012-TN2191). 

Characterization  of  the  region  dates  back  to  pre-Revolutionary  War  times  when  shipping  and 
trading  at  developing  ports  from  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  to  inland  Delaware, 
Pennsylvania,  and  New  Jersey  increased  use  of  the  watershed  (Berger  et  al.  1 994-TN21 27). 
Increasing  urbanization  and  industrialization  of  the  region  from  1840  to  present  day  have 
significantly  contributed  to  the  degradation  of  the  watershed  with  habitat  alteration,  water 
diversion,  and  increased  pollution  of  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin  ecosystems 
because  no  environmental  policies  were  established  until  the  1960s  and  later  (Berger  et 
al.  1994-TN2127).  According  to  the  most  recent  status  report  on  the  Delaware  Estuary  and 
River  Basin,  the  region  continues  to  see  some  decline  in  environmental  health  indicators,  such 
as  removal  of  estuary  sediments  and  increases  in  nitrogen  and  contaminant  levels.  However, 
environmental  conditions  such  as  technology  implementation  to  increase  fish  passage  and 
restoration  of  targeted  aquatic  habitats  have  improved  the  aquatic  ecology  for  the  watershed 
(PDE  2012-TN2191 ).  The  Delaware  River  Basin  Commission  (DRBC)  stated  in  the  State  of  the 
Delaware  River  Basin  report  for  2013  that  increases  in  temperature  and  salinity  are  expected 
with  future  sea-level  rise  and  climate  change  (DRBC  2013-TN2609).  These  potential  changes 
are  likely  to  result  in  movement  of  populations  of  more  marine  and  euryhaline  species  further  up 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

The  boundary  of  salinity  intrusion  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  also  known  as  the  salt  line, 
fluctuates  with  flow  changes.  The  salt  line  moves  in  response  to  the  tides  and  variations  in 
Delaware  River  Estuary  freshwater  discharge.  During  most  of  the  year,  the  salt  line  is  located 
between  the  Commodore  Barry  Bridge  at  Delaware  RM  82  and  Reedy  Island  at  Delaware  RM 
54  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  During  the  drought  of  record  in  the  1960s,  the  salt  line  moved  to  its 
most  upstream  historically  observed  location  at  Delaware  RM  102  (DRBC  2008-TN2277). 
Salinity  is  an  important  determinant  of  biotic  distribution  in  estuaries,  and  salinity  near  the  PSEG 
Site  varies  with  river  flow.  Between  2003  and  2010,  surface-water  salinity  measurements  near 
the  PSEG  Site  ranged  from  1 .8  to  1 3.3  parts  per  thousand  (ppt)  and  surface-water  temperatures 
ranged  from  0.4  to  28.6°C  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;

Appendix  F 


PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG 
201 1 -TN257 1 ).  Salinity  measurements  taken  over  a  greater  number  of  years  between  RM  51 
and  RM  49  report  a  minimum  salinity  of  0.1  ppt  and  a  maximum  of  17.9  ppt  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  For  the  purposes  of  EFH  habitat  assessment,  the  salinity  range  will  conservatively  be 
estimated  between  0  and  18  ppt. 

At  the  PSEG  Site  on  Artificial  Island,  the  estuary  is  tidal  with  a  net  flow  to  the  south.  The 
USACE  maintains  a  dredged  navigation  channel  near  the  center  of  the  estuary  about  6,600  ft 
(2,000  m)  west  of  the  shoreline  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  navigation  channel  is  about  40  ft  (1 2  m) 
deep  and  1,300  ft  (400  m)  wide;  however,  starting  in  2010,  the  USACE  began  implementing  the 
Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  to  deepen  the  existing  navigation  channel 
from  40  to  45  ft  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  On  the  New  Jersey  side  of  the  channel,  water  depths 
in  the  open  estuary  at  mean  low  water  are  fairly  uniform  at  about  20  ft  (6  m).  Predominant  tides 
in  the  area  are  semi-diurnal,  with  a  period  of  approximately  12  hours  and  a  mean  tidal  range  of 
5.3  ft  (1.6  m)  at  RM  52  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

The  biological  communities  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  are 
typical  of  those  that  exist  all  along  the  main  reaches  of  the  Delaware  Bay  system.  To  mitigate 
egg  and  larval  fish  loss  through  the  cooling  system  for  SGS,  PSEG  proposed  and  established 
an  estuary  enhancement  program  (EEP)  to  restore  salt  marshes  and  provide  monitoring  and 
other  structural  enhancements  to  mitigate  losses  of  aquatic  species  through  impingement  and 
entrainment  at  SGS  (Balletto  and  Teal  201 1-TN2612).  The  PSEG  EEP  was  established  in  1995 
as  part  of  New  Jersey  Pollutant  Discharge  Elimination  System  (NJPDES)  requirements  for  SGS 
and  includes  an  ongoing  biological  monitoring  program  in  addition  to  habitat  restoration  to  track 
the  success  of  the  mitigation  actions.  Because  of  the  biological  monitoring  surveys  that  have 
been  conducted  in  this  area  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  since  the  mid-1980s  in  support  of 
environmental  requirements  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  an  extensive 
long-term  data  set  exists  on  the  fishery  and  benthic  macroinvertebrate  communities  of  this  area. 

There  is  little  to  no  submerged  aquatic  vegetation  observed  in  the  sampling  areas  near  the 
PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Phytoplankton  and  zooplankton  studies  between  1973  and 
1976  identified  over  100  genera  of  phytoplankton  in  the  area  of  the  site,  with  three  diatom  taxa 
dominating  the  phytoplankton  community:  Skeletonema  costatum,  Melosira  spp.,  and 
ChaGtocaros  spp.  (IAI  1980-TN2608).  The  primary  production  contributed  by  the  phytoplankton 
community  is  highest  during  the  warmer  months  and  lowest  during  the  winter.  Because 
estuarine  systems  are  typically  characterized  by  a  shallow  euphotic  zone  and  high  turbidity, 
contribution  of  organic  carbon  to  the  base  of  the  food  web  by  phytoplankton  production  is 
relatively  small  compared  to  that  supplied  by  organic  detritus  and  other  primary  producers  such 
as  benthic  algae,  periphyton,  and  submergent  and  emergent  macrophytes  (IAI  1980-TN2608). 
Surveys  of  zooplankton  communities  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  site  have  identified 
over  100  taxa  of  microzooplankton  (IAI  1980-TN2608).  Dominant  taxa  consisted  of  rotifers  and 
copepods  (largely  nauplii).  Macroinvertebrate  plankton  samples  were  composed  of  46  taxa 
(32  arthropods),  with  the  dominant  groups  being  amphipods  Gammarus  spp.,  the  mysid  shrimp 
Neomysis  americana,  larvae  of  the  crabs  Rhithropanopeus  harrisii  and  Uca  minax,  and  the 
isopod  Chiridotea  almyra.  Seasonal  variations  in  total  density  of  zooplankton  were  not  as 
consistent  as  that  observed  for  the  phytoplankton  community  and  were  generally  related  to 
short-lived  differential  abundances  of  a  few  dominant  taxa  (IAI  1980-TN2608).

The  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  a  complex  ecosystem  with  many  species  playing  different  roles 
throughout  their  life  cycles.  Major  assemblages  of  organisms  within  the  estuarine  community 
include  plankton,  benthic  invertebrates,  and  fish.  Detailed  descriptions  of  these  assemblages 
can  be  found  in  Section  2. 4. 2. 3  of  the  EIS  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

2.2  Dredging  and  In-Water  Installation  Activities 

Before  initiating  any  site  preparation  or  development  activities,  PSEG  would  be  required  to 
obtain  the  appropriate  authorizations  regulating  alterations  to  waters  of  the  United  States, 
including  ponds  and  creeks.  Building  activities  that  could  directly  affect  EFH  include 
improvements  to  and  use  of  the  HCGS  barge  slip  during  site  development  activities,  building  the 
barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility,  installing  the  cooling  water  system  intake  and 
discharge  structures,  and  building  the  proposed  causeway  (Figures  2  and  3).  Aquatic  habitats 
potentially  affected  include  habitats  associated  with  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  the 
interconnected  system  of  tidal  wetlands  and  marsh  creeks  primarily  north  of  the  PSEG  Site. 
Potential  direct  impacts  on  aquatic  resources  as  a  result  of  building  activities  would  involve 
physical  alteration  of  habitat  (e.g.,  infilling,  cofferdam  placement,  dredging,  pile  driving)  including 
temporary  or  permanent  removal  of  associated  benthic  organisms,  sedimentation,  changes  in 
hydrological  regimes,  and  changes  in  water  quality.  Potential  indirect  impacts  include  increased 
runoff  from  impervious  surfaces  and  subsequent  erosion,  as  well  as  sedimentation  and  isolation 
of  marsh  creek  segments  due  to  infilling  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Shoreline  installation  and  site  preparation  activities  would  require  a  stormwater  pollution 
prevention  plan  (SWPPP),  developed  as  part  of  the  NJPDES  stormwater  permit,  which  would 
describe  best  management  practices  (BMPs)  to  control  sedimentation  and  erosion  and  provide 
stormwater  management.  Shoreline  structures  would  be  hardened  to  protect  from  shoreline 
erosion  using  placement  of  concrete  or  riprap  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Improvements  to  the  HCGS  barge  slip  would  include  deepening  the  existing  barge  slip  by 
another  2  ft  to  accommodate  equipment-carrying  barges  (Cook  2009-TN2713).  An  estimated 
1 ,350  yd3  of  dredged  material  would  be  removed  within  the  existing  HCGS  barge  slip  to  allow 
for  additional  clearance  of  barges  carrying  equipment  that  can  be  delivered  to  the  PSEG  Site.  If 
the  final  plant  designs  indicate  modules  larger  than  54  ft  in  width  are  required,  the  existing  60  ft 
wide  HCGS  barge  slip  may  be  widened  an  additional  20  ft  along  the  south  side  of  the  barge  slip 
and  dredged  an  additional  2  ft  below  current  barge  slip  depth.  A  double  row  of  sheet  piling 
would  need  to  be  placed  before  removal  of  excess  earth  by  dredging.  An  estimated  5,800  yd3 
of  material  would  be  removed,  and  the  existing  riprap  at  the  front  end  of  the  slip  would  be 
removed  and  then  replaced  at  the  widened  river  end  of  the  slip  (Cook  2009-TN27 1 3). 

The  new  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  would  require  dredging  about  440,000  yd3  of 
sediment  to  lower  the  river  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  61  ac  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  An  additional 
0.05  ac  of  river  bottom  habitat  would  be  removed  for  installation  of  seven  20  ft  diameter  barge 
mooring  caissons.  Installation  of  a  new  intake  structure  would  require  dredging  of  about 
150,000  yd3  of  sediment  to  lower  the  river  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  31  ac  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 
Dredging  would  also  be  required  for  installation  of  a  new  discharge  structure;  however,  specific 
details  on  the  amount  of  material  to  be  dredged  for  discharge  structure  placement  likely  would

depend  on  final  design  and  placement  criteria.  Dredged  material  disposal  would  be  either  on 
the  site  or  in  another  approved  upland  disposal  facility  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

The  installation  of  the  barge  storage  and  unloading  facilities  as  well  as  the  intake  and  discharge 
structures  would  result  in  temporary  disturbances  to  the  aquatic  habitat  in  those  portions  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary.  An  increase  in  suspended  sediments  could  occur  during  dredging 
activities;  however,  PSEG  would  comply  with  NJDEP  and  USACE  permitting  regulations 
regarding  type  of  dredge  used  as  well  as  timing  and  duration  of  dredging  to  avoid  sensitive 
aquatic  life  stage  development  or  spawning.  PSEG  also  would  use  appropriate  BMPs  to 
minimize  sedimentation  effects  as  required  for  Federal  and  State  permitting.  Motile 
invertebrates,  fish,  and  sea  turtles  might  swim  into  this  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary, 
but  they  would  be  able  to  swim  away  or  likely  would  avoid  the  area  because  of  vibratory  noise 
from  pile-driving  activities.  Mobile  macroinvertebrates  in  this  area  might  be  able  to  occupy 
adjacent  habitat  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  as  the  species  composition  and  abundance  of 
the  macroinvertebrate  community  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  site  are  similar  to 
those  of  benthic  communities  in  adjacent  benthic  areas  of  the  estuary.  Although  permanent 
alteration  of  at  least  92  ac  of  river  bottom  habitat  would  occur,  the  impacts  to  aquatic 
communities  in  the  vicinity  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

Offsite,  an  estimated  2,123  linear  ft  of  marsh  creek  channels  would  be  crossed  by  the  proposed 
causeway  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Installation  of  the  elevated  causeway  would  require 
permanent  pier  placement  for  support  structures.  However,  PSEG  plans  to  avoid  placement  in 
stream  channels  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Runoff  from  disturbed  areas  would  be  temporary  and 
controlled  through  the  use  of  BMPs  required  for  water  quality  in  compliance  with  Federal  and 
New  Jersey  permitting,  and  runoff  is  not  expected  to  adversely  affect  Delaware  River  Estuary 
surface  waters  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Vessel  use  during  dredging  or  installation  of  the  in-water  structures  and  transportation  of  large 
system  components  to  the  PSEG  Site  may  affect  the  aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary,  particularly  the  benthos.  The  main  impacts  of  using  vessels  would  include  turbulence 
from  propellers  (prop  wash)  and  accidental  spills  of  materials  overboard.  Vessels  would  be 
used  during  the  installation  of  the  cooling  water  discharge  pipeline  and  during  offloading  of 
materials  from  barges  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Vessel  operation  during  building  or  operation 
activities  may  cause  short-term,  localized  impacts  on  aquatic  species  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary.  These  impacts  should  not  affect  the  general  resources  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  or 
the  region  along  this  coast  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

2.3  Cooling  Water  System  Description  and  Operation 

Potential  effects  to  managed  species,  their  prey,  and  their  habitats  include  the  impingement  of 
managed  species  or  their  prey  as  juveniles  or  adults  at  the  facilities’  water  intake  points, 
entrainment  of  eggs  or  larvae  of  managed  species  or  their  prey  at  the  facilities’  water  intake 
points,  and  thermal  effects  from  the  discharge  of  heated  water  at  the  facilities’  discharge  points. 

Several  factors,  such  as  the  type  of  cooling  system,  the  design  and  location  of  the  intake 
structure,  and  the  amount  of  water  withdrawn  from  the  source  water  body  greatly  influence  the 
degree  to  which  impingement  and  entrainment  affect  aquatic  biota.  Impingement  and

Appendix  F 


entrainment  impacts  are  regulated  by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  or  its 
designees  (in  this  case,  NJDEP)  under  Section  316(b)  of  the  Clean  Water  Act  (33  USC  1251- 
TN662).  Section  316(b)  ‘requires  that  the  location,  design,  construction,  and  capacity  of  cooling 
water  intake  structures  reflect  the  best  technology  available  for  minimizing  adverse 
environmental  impact.  A  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  employ  closed-cycle 
cooling.  Depending  on  the  quality  of  the  makeup  water,  closed-cycle,  recirculating  cooling 
water  systems  can  reduce  water  use  by  96  to  98  percent  of  the  amount  that  the  facility  would 
use  if  it  employed  a  once-through  cooling  system  (66  FR  65256-TN243).  This  significant 
reduction  in  the  water  withdrawal  rate  results  in  a  corresponding  reduction  in  impingement  and 
entrainment  losses. 

The  Delaware  River  Estuary  would  provide  condenser  cooling  water  and  service  water  using 
closed-cycle  cooling  technology  composed  of  pumps,  a  water  basin,  and  wet  cooling  towers 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  The  intake  structure  would  be  approximately  1 10  ft  by  200  ft  to  meet 
bounding  requirements  of  normal  and  safety-related  cooling  systems  by  drawing  water  directly 
from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  The  intake  structure  would  be  located  along  the  east 
shoreline  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  west  of  the  plant  site.  This  location  is  2,800  ft  north  of 
the  existing  HCGS  service  water  intake  structure,  as  shown  in  Figure  3  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 
The  forebay  for  the  intake  would  extend  into  the  river,  and  the  area  in  front  of  the  intake 
structure  would  be  dredged  to  an  elevation  of -19  ft,  10  inches  (in.)  North  American  Vertical 
Datum  (NAVD).  It  is  assumed  that  the  river  bottom  would  be  dredged  from  the  shoreline  to  the  - 
19  ft,  10  in.  NAVD  river  bottom  contour  on  both  sides  of  the  intake  to  provide  sufficient  depth  for 
the  intake  water  withdrawal.  The  intake  structure  design  would  include  a  bar  rack  at  the  inlet  to 
prevent  debris  from  entering  intake  bays  and  would  be  cleaned  mechanically  by  a  trash  rake 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

The  intake  structure  bay  and  intake  screens  would  be  sized  so  that  the  average  intake  through- 
screen  flow  velocity  would  be  less  than  0.5  feet  per  second  (fps),  as  required  by  Clean  Water 
Act  Section  316(b)  Phase  I  requirements  specified  in  40  CFR  125.84  (40  CFR  125-TN254).  In 
accordance  with  these  rules,  this  design  value  would  be  subject  to  conditions  of  maximum  flow 
(i.e.,  all  pumps  in  the  bay  operating  at  full  capacity)  to  enhance  the  performance  of  the  debris¬ 
filtering  system  and  minimize  organism  mortality  due  to  impingement  and  entrainment 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  The  fish  protection  system  (traveling  screens  and  fish  return)  would  be 
designed  and  operated  to  comply  with  the  NJPDES  permit  that  would  be  issued  for  a  new 
plant’s  cooling  system  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Makeup  water  for  the  closed-cycle  cooling 
system  would  be  drawn  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  at  an  average  rate  of  78,196  gallons 
per  minute  (gpm;  1 12.6  million  gallons  per  day  [Mgd]),  with  consumptive  use  at  a  rate  of  26,420 
gpm  (38  Mgd)  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  In  contrast,  the  adjacent  SGS  has  a  once-through 
cooling  system,  which  takes  in  considerably  more  water  (3,024  Mgd).  Additionally,  a  new 
plant’s  slower  intake  velocity  (<0.5  fps)  compared  to  SGS’s  intake  velocity  (roughly  0.9  fps) 
increases  the  likelihood  that  smaller  and/or  slower  fish  would  be  able  to  escape  from  the  intake 
area  before  being  impinged. 

2.3.1  Impingement 

Because  of  its  location  on  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  impinge  a  variety  of  freshwater  and  marine  fish  and  shellfish.  Data  from  the

F. 3.2-15 


NUREG-2168 


F-167 


Appendix  F 


impingement  studies  for  SGS  (once-through  cooling)  indicate  that  50  to  67  finfish  species  are 
impinged  each  year,  compared  to  just  under  50  species  of  finfish  impinged  at  HCGS  (closed- 
cycle  cooling)  between  1986  and  1987.  However,  the  number  of  sampling  events  differed 
dramatically  between  the  two  plants,  with  only  46  to  48  sampling  events  at  HCGS  over  the 
same  years  (1986-87)  as  the  more  than  530  sampling  events  per  year  at  SGS  (VJSA  1988- 
TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572).  The  species  composition  in  the  screen  samples  also  varied 
between  SGS  and  HCGS  during  the  1986  to  1987  sampling  and  varied  at  SGS  between  the 
sampling  dates  in  the  1980s  and  sampling  dates  since  2003.  Table  1  compares  important,  most 
abundant  and  total  finfish  species,  as  well  as  blue  crab  ( Callinectes  sapidus ),  impinged  at  SGS 
and  HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  as  well  as  at  SGS  between  2003  and  2010. 

The  comparison  of  the  SGS  1986-87  impingement  data  with  SGS  2003-10  impingement  data 
shows  shifts  in  specific  species  abundance.  Calculating  mean  density  impinged  per  volume  of 
water  corrects  for  the  difference  in  number  of  sampling  events  as  more  frequent  samples  were 
collected  between  2003  and  2010.  Interestingly,  the  total  abundance  of  blue  crab,  Bay  Anchovy 
(. Anchoa  mitchilli ),  Summer  Flounder  (Paralichthys  dentatus),  Oyster  Toadfish  ( Opsanus  tau ), 
and  Hogchoker  ( Trinectes  maculatus)  diminished  by  a  factor  of  2  or  more  since  the  1986-87 
sampling  events.  However,  increases  in  Atlantic  Silverside  ( Menidia  menidia),  White  Perch 
( Morone  americana ),  Striped  Bass  ( Morone  saxatilis),  Atlantic  Croaker  ( Micropogonias 
undulatus),  American  Shad  ( Alosa  sapidissima),  Channel  Catfish  (Ictalurus  punctatus),  Northern 
Kingfish  ( Menticirrhus  saxatilis ),  and  Gizzard  Shad  ( Dorosoma  cepedianum )  are  evident  since 
the  1986-87  sampling.  Of  note,  impingement  data  for  SGS  from  2008  to  2010  (PSEG  2009- 
TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 )  also  were  examined  and  compared  with 
SGS  impingement  data  from  2003  to  2007  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG 
2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569)  to  assess  any  recent  deviation  from 
the  previous  2003  to  2007  trend  (data  not  shown  in  table).  Gizzard  Shad,  Northern  Kingfish, 
Black  Drum  ( Pogonias  cromis ),  and  Atlantic  Menhaden  ( Brevoortia  tyrannus )  all  increased  by  a 
factor  of  2  in  the  more  recent  sampling.  However,  Blueback  Herring  ( Alosa  aestivalis ),  Atlantic 
Croaker,  Butterfish  ( Peprilus  triacanthus),  Channel  Catfish,  Scup  ( Stenotomus  chrysops ),  and 
Spotted  Hake  ( Urophycis  regia )  were  all  reduced  by  a  factor  of  2  in  the  more  recent  sampling. 
These  deviations  in  annual  averages  may  represent  changes  to  environmental  conditions  at  the 
larger  regional  scale,  such  as  climate,  seasonal  weather  extremes,  and  fishing  pressure,  and  do 
not  appear  to  reflect  any  longer  term  trends  in  abundance. 

Impingement  mortality  was  not  reported  during  the  HCGS  impingement  sampling  in  1986  or 
1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572).  However,  sampling  at  SGS  (1986-87)  and 
(2003-10)  reported  between  97  percent  and  100  percent  live,  undamaged  blue  crab,  and  live 
condition  for  greater  than  50  percent  of  the  finfish  impinged  with  the  exception  of  White  Perch 
and  Atlantic  Croaker  juveniles  between  1986  and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-

Appendix  F 


Historical  impingement  rates  for  the  aquatic  community  from  SGS  (2003  to  2010)  and  HCGS 
(1986  to  1987)  were  used  to  estimate  potential  impingement  losses  associated  with  the 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005- 
TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009- 
TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ;  VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572). 
HCGS  is  more  similar  to  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  with  a  closed-cycle  cooling  system 
design,  versus  the  once-through  cooling  system  of  SGS.  SGS  withdraws  larger  volumes  of 
water  from  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  with  a  faster  through-screen  velocity  (roughly  0.9  fps), 
and  therefore,  SGS  would  be  expected  to  impinge  more  fish  than  the  closed-cycle  cooling 
systems  of  HCGS  and  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

PSEG  examined  the  most  recent  HCGS  impingement  data  from  1986  and  1987  with  same  year 
impingement  data  for  SGS  and  derived  a  correction  factor  by  dividing  the  HCGS  data  by  the 
SGS  data  to  allow  comparison  between  the  two  plants  and  normalize  the  differences  in  intake 
volume  and  velocity  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572).  Examination  of  1986  to  1987 
density  impingement  rates  for  finfish  show  a  total  impingement  density  average  of 
2,095.4  organisms  per  million  cubic  meters  (m3)  total  water  volume  for  HCGS  and  2,643.6 
organisms  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  for  SGS.  When  combining  both  finfish  and  blue 
crab  impingement  rates,  the  total  impingement  density  average  is  4,545.5  organisms  per  million 
m3  total  water  volume  for  HCGS  and  4,189.1  organisms  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  for 
SGS.  The  more  recent  impingement  rates  for  SGS  between  2003  and  2010  report  a  finfish 
impingement  rate  of  3,152.5  organisms  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  and  a  combined  blue 
crab  and  finfish  impingement  rate  of  3,842.9  organisms  per  million  m3  total  water  volume. 
Therefore,  a  correction  factor  may  not  be  needed  to  assess  total  organism  impingement,  and 
PSEG  used  a  conservative  approach  for  assessing  potential  impingement  rates  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  in  its  environmental  report  (ER).  However,  for 
comparative  purposes,  PSEG  presented  in  its  ER  both  the  conservative  assumption  and  the 
correction  factor  for  estimating  potential  impingement  rates  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Sampled  total  finfish  density  was  moderately  lower  at  HCGS  relative  to  SGS  using  data  sets 
either  from  1 986  to  1 987  or  from  2003  to  2010,  possibly  because  of  the  lower  approach 
velocities  to  the  HCGS  screens.  The  only  commercially  important  invertebrate  vulnerable  to 
substantial  impingement  by  the  intake  structure  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
is  the  blue  crab.  Blue  crab  densities  for  impingement  samples  at  SGS  were  690.4  per  million  m3 
total  water  volume  between  2003  and  2010  and  1 ,542.5  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  in 
1986  to  1987.  At  HCGS,  blue  crabs  were  impinged  at  a  mean  rate  of  2,450.1  per  million  m3 
total  water  volume  in  1986  to  1987  (see  Table  1 ).  It  is  possible  that  the  rate  of  impingement  at  a 
new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  for  blue  crab  may  be  less  than  in  1986  to  1987 
because  there  was  a  significant  drop  in  impingement  abundance  of  blue  crab  at  SGS  between 
the  sampling  dates  in  the  1980s  and  the  average  of  8  years  of  more  recent  sampling. 

The  applicant  estimated  impingement  rates  of  finfish  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  by  multiplying  the  more  recent  SGS  impingement  densities  by  a  correction  factor 
representing  the  ratio  of  the  total  finfish  impingement  density  at  HCGS  (1986  to  1 987)  to  that  of 
SGS  for  the  same  period.  Recent  examination  of  these  data  sets  and  impingement  rates 
derives  the  correction  factor  to  be  0.79  (2,095.4/2,643.6).  It  is  reasonable  to  use  the  historical 
HCGS  impingement  rate  correction  factor  for  the  estimate  of  impingement  rate  at  a  new  plant  at 


NUREG-2168

the  PSEG  Site  because  the  intake  design  velocity  for  a  new  plant  (less  than  0.5  fps)  is  more 
comparable  to  HCGS  than  to  SGS  (roughly  0.9  fps).  Thus,  the  estimated  total  impingement  rate 
of  finfish  due  to  operation  of  a  new  plant  is  2,490.5  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  compared 
to  the  more  recent  impingement  rate  of  3,152.5  per  million  m3  total  water  volume  for  SGS. 

White  Perch,  Atlantic  Croaker,  and  Weakfish  ( Cynoscion  regalis)  are  expected  to  comprise  the 
majority  of  the  impingement  total.  The  proposed  maximum  rate  of  water  withdrawal  for  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  equivalent  to  3.7  percent  of  the  intake  flow  at  SGS 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Assuming  a  constant  withdrawal  of  78,196  gpm  for  a  new  plant,  and 
using  the  79  percent  correction  factor  for  finfish  impingement,  a  new  plant  would  result  in 
impingement  of  an  estimated  386,526  fish  annually.  Using  the  conservative  assumption  with  no 
correction  factor  and  a  maximum  rate  of  water  withdrawal  for  a  new  plant  of  3.7  percent  of  the 
intake  flow  of  SGS,  approximately  489,148  fish  would  be  impinged  annually  at  a  new  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

The  intake  structure  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  contain  traveling  water  screens  to 
collect  debris  and  fish.  Impinged  organic  debris  and  aquatic  organisms  would  be  washed  from 
the  traveling  screens  and  returned  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Mixed  organic  and  manmade 
debris  (e.g.,  wood,  plastic)  collected  from  the  trash  racks  would  be  disposed  of  offsite.  Details 
about  the  screen  design,  screen  wash,  and  fish  return  system  for  a  new  plant  are  not  available, 
but  PSEG  has  stated  in  its  ER  that  the  screen  design  would  be  compliant  with  EPA  316(b) 
Phase  I  requirements  specified  in  40  CFR  125.84  (40  CFR  125-TN254),  similar  to  screens  at 
HCGS,  and  would  include  low-pressure  screen  washes  to  safely  remove  impinged  organisms 
and  water-filled  fish  buckets  to  improve  the  survival  of  screen-washed  fish  and  shellfish  until 
they  are  transported  back  to  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  by  the  fish  return  system  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452). 

In  terms  of  numbers,  the  estimated  impingement  of  most  fish  species  is  a  small  percentage  of 
the  commercial  and  recreational  harvests  of  these  species  in  Delaware  and  New  Jersey  as 
described  in  EIS  Section  2.4.2.  Estimated  impingement  of  blue  crab,  Weakfish,  White  Perch, 
and  Atlantic  Croaker  at  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  potentially  would  have  the  highest 
impingement  rates.  However,  it  is  expected  that  a  large  portion  of  these  impinged  organisms 
would  survive  because  of  the  comparable  impingement  mortality  recorded  for  SGS  with  a  higher 
through-screen  velocity  than  would  be  used  for  a  new  plant.  Based  on  the  planned  low  through- 
screen  intake  velocity  and  the  use  of  closed-cycle  cooling,  the  review  team  concludes  that 
impacts  from  impingement  of  aquatic  organisms  at  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  minor. 

2.3.2  Entrainment 

Small,  passively  drifting,  or  weakly  swimming  aquatic  organisms  that  are  drawn  into  the  intake 
and  pass  through  the  openings  in  the  traveling  screens  would  be  killed  by  passage  through  the 
closed-cycle  cooling  system.  Some  entrained  organisms  are  present  year-round,  such  as 
phytoplankton  and  many  types  of  zooplankton.  These  diverse  plant  and  animal  species  (often 
referred  to  as  holoplankton)  are  abundant  throughout  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  have 
short  generation  times,  so  they  can  rapidly  replace  the  losses  due  to  entrainment,  heat  shock, 
and  other  stresses.  Other  entrained  organisms,  such  as  the  larval  stages  of  fish,  crabs,  and 
other  bottom-dwelling  crustaceans,  are  present  only  seasonally  near  the  proposed  intake  of  a

Appendix  F 


new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  many  of  these  seasonally  planktonic 
organisms  (collectively  referred  to  as  meroplankton)  have  longer  life  spans  and  generation 
times,  so  losses  from  cooling  system  effects  are  not  as  readily  replaced. 

The  history  of  entrainment  sampling  at  SGS  and  analyses  of  entrainment  losses  are  described 
in  the  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants- 
Supplement  45:  Regarding  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  and  Salem  Nuclear  Generating 
Station,  Units  1  and  2,  Final  Report  (NRC  201 1 -TN31 31 ).  Most  recently,  entrainment  of  fish 
eggs,  larvae,  juveniles,  and  adults  in  the  SGS  cooling  water  system  was  studied  between  2003 
and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN2571).  Over  the  8-year  period,  between  25  and  38  species  were  identified  each  year  among 
the  entrained  fish  (eggs,  larvae,  small  juveniles,  and  adults).  Of  these,  92  percent  of  the 
entrainment  samples  were  composed  of  two  species:  Bay  Anchovy  (75.3  percent)  and  Naked 
Goby  (Gobiosoma  bosc)  (16.7  percent).  Additional  species  that  comprised  over  98  percent  of 
all  entrained  species  included  Atlantic  Croaker  (3.5  percent),  Striped  Bass  (1.4  percent), 
Weakfish  (0.8  percent),  Atlantic  Menhaden  (0.4  percent),  and  Atlantic  Silverside  (0.4  percent). 
Bay  Anchovy  was  the  most  abundantly  entrained  species  for  the  egg  (99.7  percent)  and  adult 
(57  percent)  life  stages;  Naked  Goby  was  the  most  abundantly  entrained  larval  species  (49 
percent);  and  Atlantic  Croaker  was  the  most  abundantly  entrained  juvenile  species  (56  percent) 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG 
2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).  Seasonal 
vulnerability  to  entrainment  is  species-specific.  For  example,  eggs,  larvae,  and  juveniles  of  Bay 
Anchovy  were  most  numerous  in  entrainment  samples  in  summer  months  (June  and  July), 
whereas  Atlantic  Croaker  juveniles  were  most  abundant  in  the  fall  (October  and  November) 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG 
2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).  In  general, 
the  densities  of  entrained  individuals  for  most  fish  species  were  greatest  in  the  spring  and/or 
summer,  corresponding  to  the  spawning  periods  for  these  species.  Total  densities  of  all  fish  life 
stages  in  the  entrainment  samples  ranged  from  54.0/100  m3  (2003)  to  264.2/100  m3  (2007)  and 
averaged  125.0/100  m3  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

PSEG  applied  estimated  annual  entrainment  rates  from  SGS  directly  to  calculate  entrainment 
rates  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  entrainment  rates  at  SGS  were 
applied  to  a  new  plant  without  a  correction  factor  because  entrained  organisms  are  planktonic. 
Entrainment  rates  are  a  function  of  water  withdrawal  rates  and  are  not  influenced  by  through- 
screen  velocities.  Entrainment  rates  of  holoplankton  and  meroplankton  would  be  much  smaller 
for  a  new  plant  than  for  SGS  because  of  the  smaller  volume  of  water  withdrawn  by  the  closed- 
cycle  system  at  a  new  plant.  Based  on  the  small  volume  of  water  withdrawn  for  the  closed- 
cycle  cooling  water  system  at  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  the  annual  entrainment  of 
organisms  during  operation  of  the  intake  system  is  expected  to  be  minor  and  average  less  than 
125  organisms  per  100  m3.  Bay  Anchovy,  the  likely  dominantly  entrained  species  for  a  new 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  is  a  highly  abundant  species  in  the  area,  with  females  spawning  every  4 
to  5  days  over  the  spawning  season  (Zastrow  et  al.  1991-TN2670).

2.3.3  Cooling  Water  Discharge  Impacts 

Blowdown  from  the  cooling  towers,  service  water  system,  and  other  aqueous  waste  streams  at 
a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  combined  and  discharged  to  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  at  an  average  flow  rate  of  50,516  gpm  (1 13  cfs)  and  a  velocity  of  9.2 
fps,  as  described  in  EIS  Section  5.2.3. 1 .  The  submerged  48-in.  diameter  discharge  pipe  would 
be  located  8,000  ft  north  of  the  SGS  discharge  pipe  and  4,000  ft  north  of  the  HCGS  discharge 
pipe.  The  outlet  of  the  discharge  pipe  would  be  100  ft  from  the  shoreline,  12  ft  below  mean 
lower  low  water  and  3  ft  above  the  river  bottom  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Relative  to  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary,  the  discharged  water  would  have  an  elevated  temperature  and 
increased  concentration  of  both  natural  chemical  constituents  and  chemical  contaminants. 
Because  of  the  tidal  nature  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  this  area,  the  direction  of  the 
thermal  discharge  plume  would  vary  with  the  tidal  cycle. 

2. 3. 3. 7  Thermal  Impacts 

Potential  thermal  impacts  on  aquatic  organisms  could  include  heat  stress,  cold  shock,  and  the 
creation  of  favorable  conditions  for  invasive  species. 

As  described  in  EIS  Section  5. 2. 3.1,  the  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  where  discharge 
would  occur  is  located  in  Zone  5  between  Delaware  RM  78.8  and  RM  48.2.  The  DRBC 
temperature-related  standards  for  Zone  5  require  that  the  discharge-induced  water  temperature 
increases  above  the  ambient  water  temperature  in  the  river  outside  the  permitted  heat 
dissipation  area  (HDA)  may  not  increase  by  more  than  4°F  (2.2°C)  from  September  through 
May  and  by  1.5°F  (0.8°C)  from  June  through  August,  with  a  year-round  maximum  water 
temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR  Part  410;  DRBC  201 1-TN2371 )  (Figure  4).  Recent 
trawling  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  zone  in  the  vicinity  of  SGS  and  HCGS  between  2003 
and  2010  has  not  identified  significant  shifts  in  species  abundances  near  the  SGS  and  HCGS 
discharge  areas  compared  to  adjacent  zones  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566; 
PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG 
2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).  The  volume  of  the  thermal  discharge  from  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (50,516  gpm)  is  only  2.4  percent  of  that  from  SGS  (about 
2,100,000  gpm  circulated  through  the  once-through  cooling  system)  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  As 
discussed  in  Section  5.2.3. 1 ,  the  thermal  plume  of  the  discharge  from  a  new  plant  would  have  a 
maximum  extent  of  about  700  ft  into  the  river  from  the  discharge  location,  about  300  ft  upstream 
from  the  discharge,  and  about  500  ft  downstream  from  the  discharge;  would  be  completely 
contained  within  the  existing  SGS  HDA;  and  would  not  be  expected  to  impede  fish  migration.

Appendix  F 


During  flood  tide  conditions,  when  the  median  water  temperature  exceeds  79.4°F  (26.3°C),  the 
review  team  estimated  that  a  portion  of  the  thermal  plume  would  exceed  86°F  (30°C)  because 
of  the  cumulative  effects  from  SGS,  HCGS,  and  a  new  plant  (3.6°F,  1 ,5°F,  1 ,5°F,  respectively). 
However,  the  combination  of  high-velocity  discharge,  turbulence  in  the  discharge  outlet  area, 
and  rapid  mixing  of  the  discharge  effluent  would  limit  the  size  of  the  thermal  plume. 

A  factor  related  to  thermal  discharges  that  may  affect  aquatic  biota  is  cold  shock.  Cold  shock 
occurs  when  aquatic  organisms  that  have  been  acclimated  to  warm  water  are  exposed  to  a 
sudden  temperature  decrease.  This  sometimes  occurs  when  single-unit  power  plants  shut 
down  suddenly  in  winter  or  when  an  unseasonable  cold  weather  event  occurs.  Cold  shock  is 
less  likely  to  occur  at  a  multiple-unit  plant  because  the  temperature  decrease  from  shutting 
down  one  unit  is  moderated  by  the  heated  discharge  from  the  units  that  continue  to  operate. 
Based  on  the  foregoing,  any  thermal  impacts  on  the  fish  populations  due  to  cold  shock  would  be 
expected  to  be  minor. 

2. 3. 3. 2  Chemical  Impacts 

As  described  in  EIS  Section  3. 2. 1.2,  the  cycles  of  concentration  increase  the  concentration  of 
total  dissolved  solids  and  minerals  in  the  blowdown.  In  addition,  the  blowdown  would  contain 
chemical  additives  such  as  biocides  and  pH-adjusting  chemicals  to  ensure  proper  functioning  of 
the  cooling  towers.  Predicted  concentrations  of  dissolved  chemical  constituents  in  the 
discharges  from  the  cooling  water  and  other  systems  are  expected  to  be  compliant  and 
controlled  by  the  terms  of  the  NJPDES  permit  that  would  be  issued  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2. 3. 3. 3  Physical  Impacts 

Because  of  the  increased  temperature  and  chemical  content  of  the  discharged  water  compared 
to  ambient  conditions,  the  plume  is  expected  to  be  negatively  buoyant  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 
Due  to  the  high  discharge  velocity  of  9.21  fps,  there  would  be  rapid  mixing  with  tidal  currents 
upstream  and  downstream,  with  some  potential  for  scouring  occurring  at  the  point  of  discharge. 
To  minimize  the  scouring  potential,  PSEG  would  place  riprap  or  other  engineered  features  near 
the  end  of  the  discharge  pipe  and  reduce  the  possible  interactions  of  the  discharge  plume  with 
bottom  habitats  and  bottom-dwelling  aquatic  organisms  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2. 3. 3. 4  Barge  Traffic 

Use  of  the  HCGS  barge  slip  and  the  PSEG  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility  area  are 
expected  to  be  infrequent  during  operation.  However,  propeller  wash  may  cause  localized 
scouring  and  sedimentation  within  the  barge  slip.  Because  this  area  would  be  previously 
disturbed  during  site  preparation  and  used  during  transport  of  building  materials,  it  is  unlikely 
that  the  temporary  habitat  disruption  would  have  adverse  effects  on  the  aquatic  communities  in 
the  area  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Adjacent,  undisturbed  habitat  is  available,  and  mobile  aquatic 
organisms  likely  would  avoid  the  barge  slip  area.

2. 3. 3. 5  Maintenance  Dredging 

Dredging  may  be  required  to  maintain  use  of  the  HCGS  barge  slip  and  intake  channel  as  well  as 
the  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility  during  operation.  Seasonal  restrictions  on  activities  to 
minimize  effects  to  sensitive  aquatic  life  stage  development  or  spawning  may  be  required  for 
Federal  and  State  permitting.  Any  effects  to  water  quality,  such  as  siltation,  during  these 
infrequent  periods  would  be  temporary  and  would  be  managed  through  the  use  of  BMPs  as 
required  by  Federal  and  State  permits,  and  dredged  material  disposal  would  be  in  approved 
upland  disposal  areas  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Mobile  organisms  in  the  area  would  avoid 
activities  involved  in  dredging  and  could  use  adjacent,  undisturbed  habitat  during  the  temporary 
disruption. 

2. 3. 3. 6  Stormwater  Management 

As  described  in  EIS  section  5.2.3. 1,  PSEG  would  develop  an  SWPPP  to  minimize  stormwater 
drainage  effects  to  nearby  surface  waters.  The  SWPPP  would  be  required  to  meet  NJPDES 
stormwater  discharge  requirements. 

3.0  EFH  SPECIES  NEAR  THE  SITE 

3.1  EFH  Species  Identified  for  Preliminary  Analysis 

The  1996  amendments  to  the  MSA  (16  USC  1801-TN1061)  identified  the  importance  of  habitat 
protection  to  healthy  fisheries.  The  amendments,  known  as  the  Sustainable  Fisheries  Act  of 
1996,  strengthened  the  authority  of  governing  agencies  to  protect  and  conserve  the  habitat  of 
marine,  estuarine,  and  anadromous  animals.  EFH  is  defined  as  the  waters  and  substrate 
necessary  for  spawning,  breeding,  feeding,  or  growth  to  maturity  for  managed  fishery  species. 
Identifying  EFH  is  an  essential  component  in  the  development  of  fishery  management  plans  to 
evaluate  the  effects  of  habitat  loss  or  degradation  on  fishery  stocks  and  to  take  actions  to 
mitigate  such  damage.  NMFS  considers  the  estuarine  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  and  tidal 
waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  to  be  EFH  for  15  species  (PNNL  2013-TN2687;  NMFS  2013- 
TN2804),  which  are  listed  in  Table  2. 

The  review  team  compared  salinity,  water  temperatures,  and  depth  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG 
Site  with  EFH  requirements  for  each  of  the  species  and  life  stages  that  appear  in  Table  2  to 
further  refine  the  EFH  species  with  the  potential  to  be  adversely  affected  by  the  proposed 
action.  The  EFH  requirements  of  several  of  the  fish  species  and  life  stages  are  conditions  that 
have  been  reported  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  (see  Table  3).  For  those  species  whose 
EFH  requirements  do  not  match  the  local  conditions,  the  review  team  did  not  consider  these 
species  or  life  stages  further  in  this  EFH  assessment.  With  the  exception  of  the  Atlantic 
Butterfish,  the  exclusion  of  certain  species  and  life  stages  from  consideration  was  based  on 
salinity  requirements  being  too  high  for  the  habitat  near  the  PSEG  Site.  Atlantic  Butterfish  was 
excluded  based  on  depth  requirements  not  being  met  for  habitat  near  the  PSEG  Site.  The 
remaining  species  and  life  stages  whose  EFH  requirements  match  local  conditions  appear  in 
Table  4.  Accordingly,  the  remaining  species  are  described  in  detail  in  Section  3.2.

3.2  EFH  Species  Identified  for  In-Depth  Analysis 

3.2.1  Black  Sea  Bass  ( Centropristis  striata) 

3. 2. 1.1  Species  Description 

The  Black  Sea  Bass  is  a  member  of  the  Serranidae  family  and  has  an  unusual  life  history. 

Black  Sea  Bass  start  out  as  females  with  full  reproductive  capability  and  then  switch  to  become 
fertile  males  sometime  around  6  years  of  age.  Adults  are  found  along  the  continental  shelf  in 
habitats  characterized  by  relief  structures  such  as  reefs  or  sunken  structures.  Juveniles  or 
young-of-year  fish  prefer  more  estuarine  habitats  but  are  also  associated  with  relief  habitat 
(Drohan  et  al.  2007-TN2825).  Adults  overwinter  in  deep  offshore  waters  and  move  inshore  in 
the  spring.  Off  coastal  New  Jersey,  spawning  occurs  between  May  and  June.  Females  release 
191,000  to  369,500  eggs  in  waters  between  20  and  50  m  depth  in  nearshore  continental  waters 
(Drohan  et  al.  2007-TN2825).  Both  juveniles  and  adults  feed  on  benthic  invertebrates  such  as 
crustaceans  and  squid  (MDMF  2006-TN2159). 

3. 2. 1.2  Status  of  the  Fishery 

The  Mid-Atlantic  Fishery  Management  Council  (MAFMC)  and  Atlantic  States  Marine  Fisheries 
Commission  (ASMFC)  jointly  manage  the  Black  Sea  Bass  under  Amendment  1 3  of  the  Summer 
Flounder,  Scup,  and  Black  Sea  Bass  Fishery  Management  Plan  (ASMFC  2013-TN2826). 

Black  Sea  Bass  are  highly  valued  by  both  commercial  and  recreational  fishermen  throughout 
the  Mid-Atlantic  as  a  food  fish.  Commercial  harvests  of  Black  Sea  Bass  in  New  Jersey  and 
Delaware  totaled  293,609  lb  and  3,524  lb,  respectively,  in  2011  (NOAA  201 3-TN21 74). 
Recreational  harvests  in  201 1  totaled  1 ,568,503  individuals  in  New  Jersey  and  326,358  in 
Delaware  (NOAA  201 3-TN21 75).  The  September  26,  2013,  status  of  the  stock  report  indicated 
that  Black  Sea  Bass  are  currently  not  considered  overfished  (MAMFC  2013-TN2827). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Black  Sea  Bass  are  more 
commonly  abundant  in  Delaware  River  waters  to  the  south  of  the  PSEG  Site.  A  single  fish  was 
collected  in  Delaware  River  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site,  and  none  were  collected  in  the  marsh 
creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567; 
PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG 
201 1-TN2571;  PSEG  2013-TN2586). 

3.2.2  Clearnose  Skate  (Raja  eglanteria) 

3.2.2. 1  Species  Description 

The  Clearnose  Skate  occurs  along  the  eastern  Atlantic  coast  and  in  the  coastal  Gulf  of  Mexico 
in  waters  between  9  and  30°C.  Clearnose  Skates  prefer  habitat  characterized  by  soft  or 
gravelly  substrate  between  1  and  30  m  depth,  although  some  species  have  been  reported  at 
depths  exceeding  100  m  (Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2822).  This  species  moves  to  inshore  waters 
during  the  spring  and  early  summer  to  reproduce  and  moves  to  offshore  waters  during  fall  and 
early  winter.  An  oviparous  species,  females  produce  egg  cases  that  are  deposited  in  pairs  and 
incubate  for  an  average  of  82  days  for  species  occurring  north  of  Cape  Hatteras,  North  Carolina

F. 3.2-27 


NUREG-2168 


F-179 


Appendix  F 


(Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2822).  Females  may  lay  up  to  35  pairs  of  eggs  in  one  breeding  season. 
Clearnose  Skates  prey  on  polychaete  worms,  small  crustaceans,  squid,  and  small  fishes  such 
as  Weakfish,  Butterfish,  and  Scup. 

3. 2. 2. 2  Status  of  Fishery 

The  Clearnose  Skate  is  managed  as  part  of  the  Northeast  Skate  Complex,  although  currently 
this  species  is  not  considered  to  be  overfished  (Sosebee  2006-TN2828).  Skates  have  been 
reported  in  New  England  fishery  landings  since  the  late  1800s  and  primarily  have  been  fished 
commercially  as  bait,  although  harvest  also  occurs  incidentally  as  bycatch  in  other  species 
fished  by  trawl  and  gillnets  (NOAA  2013-TN2829). 

A  total  of  104  Clearnose  Skate  were  captured  during  trawling  surveys  by  PSEG  between  2003 
and  2010  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  south  of  the  PSEG  Site,  with  no  observations  from 
field  surveys  occurring  in  the  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005- 
TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-

3.2.3  Little  Skate  (Leucoraja  erinacea ) 

3.2.3. 1  Species  Description 

The  Little  Skate  is  most  commonly  found  in  onshore  and  offshore  waters  associated  with  the 
Mid-Atlantic  Bight  and  Georges  Bank  in  the  northeast.  Little  Skate  prefer  sandy  or  gravelly 
habitat  where  they  can  bury  themselves  during  the  day  (Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2823).  Little 
Skate  juveniles  and  adults  move  into  nearshore  water  in  the  winter  and  have  been  reported  in 
Delaware  Bay  waters  between  October  and  May  when  water  temperatures  were  less  than  15°C, 
with  the  highest  abundances  occurring  in  the  lower  Delaware  Bay  near  the  mouth  (Packer  et 
al.  2003-TN2823).  Like  the  Clearnose  Skate,  Little  Skate  deposit  egg  cases  during  winter 
months.  Little  Skate  juveniles  and  adults  feed  on  small  crustaceans,  amphipods,  and 
polychaete  worms  (Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2823). 

3. 2. 3. 2  Status  of  Fishery 

The  Little  Skate  is  managed  as  part  of  the  Northeast  Skate  Complex,  where  it  is  fished 
commercially  along  with  other  skate  species  for  bait  and  for  harvest  of  skate  wings  (Packer  et 
al.  2003-TN2823).  The  Little  Skate  is  not  currently  considered  to  be  overfished  (NEFMC  2012- 
TN2830).  Skates  have  been  reported  in  New  England  fishery  landings  since  the  late  1800s  and 
primarily  have  been  fished  commercially  as  bait,  although  harvest  also  occurs  incidentally  as 
bycatch  in  other  species  fished  by  trawl  and  gillnets  (NOAA  2013-TN2829). 

A  total  of  27  Little  Skate  were  captured  during  trawling  surveys  by  PSEG  between  2003  and 
2010  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  south  of  the  PSEG  Site,  with  no  observations  from  field 
surveys  occurring  in  the  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-

3.2.4  Scup  (Stenotomus  chrysops) 

3.2.4. 1  Species  Description 

The  Scup,  also  known  as  the  Porgy,  range  along  the  continental  shelf  of  North  America  and  are 
most  common  between  Cape  Cod,  Massachusetts,  and  Cape  Hatteras,  North  Carolina 
(MDMF  2006-TN2161 ).  Scup  form  schools  in  offshore  waters  to  overwinter  and  move  to 
inshore  habitats  characterized  by  smooth  bottom  substrate  in  the  spring  and  summer.  Adult 
Scup  spawn  annually  in  inshore  waters  between  May  and  August  in  southern  New  England 
waters  (ASMFC  201 3-TN2831 ).  Juvenile  and  adult  scup  prefer  a  variety  of  intertidal  and 
subtidal  habitats  characterized  by  rocky  ledges,  reefs,  sand,  shell,  and  mud  bottoms  and  are 
commonly  found  in  large  estuaries  during  summer  and  fall  months  (ASMFC  2013-TN2831). 
Adults  feed  on  small  crustaceans,  mollusks,  annelid  worms,  jellyfish,  and  sand  dollars 
(MDMF  2006-TN2161). 

3. 2. 4. 2  Status  of  Fishery 

The  MAFMC  and  ASMFC  jointly  manage  the  Scup  under  Amendment  1 3  of  the  Summer 
Flounder,  Scup,  and  Black  Sea  Bass  Fishery  Management  Plan  (ASMFC  2013-TN2826).  Scup 
are  fished  commercially  and  recreationally.  The  commercial  harvest  totaled  3,726,460  lb  in 
New  Jersey  and  8  lb  in  Delaware  in  201 1  (NOAA  2013-TN2174).  Recreational  harvests  in  201 1 
totaled  89,882  individuals  in  New  Jersey  and  1,258  in  Delaware  (NOAA  2013-TN2175).  The 
September  26,  2013,  status  of  the  stock  report  indicated  that  Scup  are  currently  not  considered 
overfished  (MAMFC  2013-TN2827). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Scup  are  not  found  in 
Delaware  River  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  but  are  more  abundant  to  the  south  of  the  PSEG 
Site  in  Delaware  Bay  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG

3.2.5  Summer  Flounder  (Paralichthys  dentatus) 

3. 2. 5. 7  Species  Description 

The  Summer  Flounder  ranges  along  the  Atlantic  coast  from  Maine  to  northern  Florida.  The 
Summer  Flounder  prefers  sandy  substrate  for  burrowing  but  may  also  use  mud  or  silt  substrates 
found  in  estuary  habitats  (Grimes  et  al.  1989-TN2150).  Spawning  behaviors  are  not  clearly 
understood  but  are  assumed  to  occur  sometime  between  late  fall  and  early  spring  in  bottom 
habitats  along  continental  shelf  waters  (Grimes  et  al.  1989-TN2150).  Summer  Flounder  eggs 
are  found  in  pelagic  waters  between  14  and  17°C,  and  larvae  peak  in  abundance  around 
November  in  waters  between  9  and  18°C  (ASMFC  2013-TN2832).  Larvae  drift  into  estuarine 
habitats  where  juvenile  development  takes  place.  Juveniles  and  adults  prefer  estuarine  marsh 
creeks  with  mud  or  sandy  substrate  for  burying  (ASMFC  2013-TN2832).  Adults  feed  on  smaller 
fish,  squids,  crustaceans,  mollusks,  marine  worms,  and  sand  dollars  (Grimes  et  al.  1989- 
TN2150).

3. 2. 5. 2  Status  of  Fishery 

The  MAFMC  and  ASMFC  jointly  manage  the  Summer  Flounder  under  Amendment  13  of  the 
Summer  Flounder,  Soup,  and  Black  Sea  Bass  Fishery  Management  Plan  (ASMFC  2013- 
TN2826).  Summer  Flounder  are  considered  an  excellent  food  fish  and  an  important  species  in 
both  recreational  and  commercial  harvests.  Commercial  harvests  in  New  Jersey  and  Delaware 
totaled  2,830,403  lb  and  836  lb,  respectively,  in  2011  (NOAA  201 3-TN2174).  Recreational 
harvests  in  201 1  totaled  9,101 ,622  individuals  in  New  Jersey  and  808,442  in  Delaware 
(NOAA  2013-TN2175).  The  September  26,  2013,  status  of  the  stock  report  indicated  that 
Summer  Flounder  are  currently  not  considered  overfished  (MAMFC  2013-TN2827). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  Summer  Flounder  are 
found  in  Delaware  River  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  have  been  detected  in  offsite  small  and 
large  marsh  creeks  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG

3.2.6  Windowpane  Flounder  (Scophthalmus  aquosus ) 

3. 2. 6. 7  Species  Description 

The  Windowpane  Flounder  is  found  in  estuaries,  nearshore  waters,  and  waters  along  the 
continental  shelf  of  the  northwestern  Atlantic  from  the  Gulf  of  St.  Lawrence  in  Canada  to 
northern  Florida  (Hendrickson  2006-TN21 53).  Adults  prefer  muddy  or  fine-grain  sandy 
substrates  in  waters  and  tolerate  a  wide  range  of  temperatures  and  salinities — from  23°F  to 
80.2°F  (0°C  to  26.8°C)  and  5.5  ppt  to  36  ppt  (Chang  et  al.  1999-TN2133).  Spawning  starts  in 
February  or  March  and  peaks  in  May  over  inner  continental  shelf  waters  (Chang  et  al.  1999- 
TN2133).  Females  release  pelagic,  buoyant  eggs  that  hatch  in  approximately  8  days.  In 
spring-spawned  fish,  larvae  settle  in  estuaries  and  over  the  continental  shelf  and  then  inhabit 
the  polyhaline  portions  of  the  estuary  throughout  the  summer.  In  fall-spawned  fish,  larvae  settle 
mostly  on  the  shelf.  Juveniles  migrate  from  estuaries  to  coastal  waters  during  autumn,  and  they 
overwinter  offshore  in  deeper  waters.  Adults  remain  offshore  throughout  the  year  and  are  highly 
abundant  off  southern  New  Jersey  (Chang  et  al.  1 999-TN21 33). 

Juvenile  and  adult  Windowpane  have  similar  food  sources,  including  small  crustaceans  and  fish 
larvae  of  hakes  and  Tomcod  ( Microgadus  tomcod),  and  in  turn  are  preyed  upon  by  a  number  of 
species  including  Spiny  Dogfish  ( Squalus  acanthias ),  Thorny  Skate  ( Amblyraja  radiata), 
Goosefish  ( Lophius  americanus),  Atlantic  Cod  ( Gadus  morhua ),  Black  Sea  Bass,  Weakfish,  and 
Summer  Flounder  (Chang  et  al.  1999-TN2133). 

3. 2. 6. 2  Status  of  the  Fishery 

The  Windowpane  Flounder  is  managed  by  the  New  England  Fishery  Management  Council 
(NEFMC)  as  two  stocks,  the  Gulf  of  Maine/Georges  Bank  stock  and  the  Southern  New 
England/Mid-Atlantic  stock,  under  its  Multispecies  Groundfish  Fishery  Management  Plan 
(Hendrickson  2006-TN21 53).  Windowpane  Flounder  have  never  been  widely  or  directly 
targeted  as  a  commercial  species  but  have  been  harvested  in  mixed-species  fisheries  since  the 
1900s.  Landings  ranged  from  1.1  to  2.0  million  lbs  (500  to  900  metric  tonnes  [MT])  per  year

between  1975  and  1981,  increased  to  a  record  high  of  4.6  million  lbs  (2,100  MT)  in  1985,  and 
have  since  steadily  declined  (Hendrickson  2006-TN2153).  Although  the  Windowpane  Flounder 
is  not  currently  a  major  target  of  the  commercial  fishing  industry,  a  total  of  1 1 ,902  lb  were 
harvested  commercially  in  New  Jersey  in  2009  (NOAA  2013-TN2174). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  adult  and  juvenile 
Windowpane  Flounder  are  not  commonly  found  in  Delaware  River  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site 
but  were  frequently  collected  in  surveys  south  of  the  PSEG  Site  in  Delaware  Bay  (PSEG  2004- 
TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-

TN2586). 

3.2.7  Winter  Flounder  ( Pleuronectes  americanus ) 

3.2. 7. 7  Species  Description 

The  Winter  Flounder  ranges  along  the  Atlantic  coast  from  Labrador,  Canada,  to  Georgia. 

Winter  Flounder  prefer  a  variety  of  bottom  substrates  in  inshore  bays  and  estuaries  during  the 
winter  and  migrate  to  deeper  water  in  the  summer  (Hendrickson  et  al.  2006-TN21 54).  Adult 
Winter  Flounder  migrate  inshore  to  bays  and  estuaries  in  the  fall  and  early  winter  to  spawn  and 
may  remain  inshore  year-round  in  areas  where  temperatures  are  59°F  (15°C)  or  lower  and 
where  enough  food  is  available  (Grimes  et  al.  1 989-TN21 50).  Eggs  adhere  to  each  other  to 
form  large  clumps  on  the  bottom  and  are  most  often  found  at  salinities  between  10  and  30  ppt 
(Buckley  1989-TN2833).  Larvae  initially  are  planktonic  but  become  increasingly  benthic  as  they 
develop  (Pereira  et  al.  1999-TN2834).  Juveniles  and  adults  are  completely  benthic,  with 
juveniles  remaining  in  estuaries  for  the  first  year  (Grimes  et  al.  1 989-TN21 50).  Water 
temperature  appears  to  dictate  adult  movements;  south  of  Cape  Cod,  Winter  Flounder  spend 
the  colder  months  in  inshore  and  estuarine  waters  and  move  farther  offshore  in  the  warmer 
months  (Buckley  1989-TN2833).  Adult  Winter  Flounder  tolerate  salinities  from  5  to  35  ppt  and 
prefer  waters  temperatures  from  32°F  to  77°F  (0°C  to  25°C). 

Juveniles  remain  in  their  natal  shallow  waters  during  their  first  summer  and  feed  on  diatoms, 
small  crustaceans,  and  mollusks.  Adults  prey  on  small  crustaceans,  annelid  worms,  small 
mollusks,  and  fish  (Hendrickson  et  al.  2006-TN2154).  Adults  and  juveniles  are  an  important 
food  source  for  other  predatory  fish  such  as  the  Striped  Bass,  Bluefish  (Pomatomus  saltatrix), 
Goosefish,  Spiny  Dogfish,  other  flounders,  and  birds  inhabiting  estuarine  marshes 
(Buckley  1 989-TN2833). 

3. 2. 7. 2  Status  of  the  Fishery 

Winter  Flounder,  managed  by  the  ASMFC  in  state  waters  and  by  the  NEFMC  in  Federal  waters 
under  the  Northeast  Multispecies  Fishery  Management  Plan,  is  one  of  the  most  important 
species  for  commercial  and  recreational  fisheries  on  the  Atlantic  coast  (Buckley  1989-TN2833). 
Winter  Flounder  are  generally  commercially  harvested  using  otter  trawl,  but  the  species  is  also  a 
popular  recreational  fish.  Winter  Flounder  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  are  part  of  the 
Southern  New  England/Mid-Atlantic  Bight  Stock.  This  stock  peaked  in  the  mid-1960s  with  26 
million  lbs  (12,000  MT)  in  landings  in  1966,  declined  through  the  1970s,  peaked  again  through 
the  1 980s  with  24  million  lbs  (1 1 ,000  MT)  in  landings  in  1 981 ,  and  has  since  continued  to 
decline  (Hendrickson  et  al.  2006-TN21 54).  The  Winter  Flounder  is  the  most  important

recreationally  caught  flounder  in  inshore  waters  of  the  Mid-Atlantic  (Grimes  et  al.  1989-TN2150). 
The  commercial  harvest  in  New  Jersey  totaled  6,051  lb  in  201 1  (NOAA  201 3-TN21 74). 

The  recreational  harvest  totaled  83,086  individuals  in  New  Jersey  in  2007  (NOAA  2013- 
TN2175). 

Trawling,  seining,  and  weir  surveys  between  2003  and  2010  indicate  juvenile  and  adult  Winter 
Flounder  are  not  found  in  Delaware  River  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  but  were  observed  in 
Delaware  Bay  waters  south  of  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566; 

PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG 
2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ;  PSEG  2013-TN2586). 

3.2.8  Winter  Skate  (Leucoraja  ocellata) 

3.2.8. 1  Species  Description 

The  Winter  Skate  occurs  along  the  eastern  Atlantic  coast  between  southern  New  England 
waters  and  coastal  North  Carolina  waters  with  water  temperatures  between  -1.2  and  19°C. 
Winter  skates  prefer  habitat  characterized  by  sandy  substrate  between  1  and  300  m  depth 
(Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2824).  This  species  moves  to  inshore  waters  during  the  spring  and  early 
summer  to  reproduce  and  moves  to  offshore  waters  during  fall  and  early  winter.  In  the 
Delaware  Bay,  adult  and  juvenile  Winter  Skate  have  been  observed  to  prefer  higher  salinities  in 
the  fall  and  winter  and  tolerate  lower  salinities  in  the  spring  (Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2824). 
Females  produce  egg  cases  that  are  deposited  in  pairs  on  sandy  substrates,  and  fully  formed 
juveniles  hatch  from  these  egg  cases  (Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2824).  Winter  skates  prey  on 
polychaete  worms  and  amphipods  and  are  prey  to  sharks,  other  skate  species,  and  gray  seals 
(Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2824). 

3. 2. 8. 2  Status  of  Fishery 

The  Winter  Skate  is  managed  as  part  of  the  Northeast  Skate  Complex,  where  it  is  fished 
commercially  along  with  other  skate  species  for  bait  and  for  harvest  of  skate  wings  for  human 
consumption  (Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2824).  The  Winter  Skate  is  not  currently  considered  to  be 
overfished  (NEFMC  2012-TN2830).  Skates  have  been  reported  in  New  England  fishery 
landings  since  the  late  1800s  and  primarily  have  been  fished  commercially  as  bait,  although 
harvest  also  occurs  incidentally  as  bycatch  in  other  species  fished  by  trawl  and  gillnets 
(NOAA  2013-TN2829). 

A  total  of  28  Winter  Skate  were  captured  during  trawling  surveys  by  PSEG  between  2003  and 
2010  in  Delaware  River  Estuary  waters  south  of  the  PSEG  Site,  with  no  observations  from  field 
surveys  occurring  in  the  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005- 
TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009- 
TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011-TN2571;  PSEG  2013-TN2586). 

4.0  POTENTIAL  ADVERSE  EFFECTS  TO  EFH 

The  provisions  of  the  MSA  define  an  “adverse  effect”  to  EFH  as  the  following  (50  CFR  600- 
TN1342): 


NUREG-2168 


F. 3.2-32 

F-184 


November  2015 


Appendix  F 


Adverse  effect  means  any  impact  that  reduces  quality  and/or  quantity 
of  EFH.  Adverse  effects  may  include  direct  or  indirect  physical, 
chemical,  or  biological  alterations  of  the  waters  or  substrate  and  loss 
of,  or  injury  to,  benthic  organisms,  prey  species  and  their  habitat,  and 
other  ecosystem  components,  if  such  modifications  reduce  the  quality 
and/or  quantity  of  EFH.  Adverse  effects  to  EFH  may  result  from 
actions  occurring  within  EFH  or  outside  of  EFH  and  may  include 
site-specific  or  habitat-wide  impacts,  including  individual,  cumulative,  or 
synergistic  consequences  of  actions. 


The  review  team  has  identified  the  following  potential  PSEG  building  and  operation  activities 
that  may  cause  adverse  effects  to  EFH: 

•  Dredging  and  in-water  installation  activities 

•  Impingement 

•  Entrainment 

•  Discharge  effects  (thermal,  chemical,  and  physical) 

•  Maintenance  dredging  and  barge  traffic 

•  Loss  of  forage  species  through  activities  listed  above 

In  the  following  sections,  each  of  these  issues  is  addressed  for  each  of  the  species  identified  for 
in-depth  analysis  in  Table  4.  Cumulative  effects  are  discussed  separately  in  Section  5.0  below. 

4.1  Black  Sea  Bass 

As  discussed  in  Section  3.2.1,  the  NMFS  has  designated  EFH  for  juvenile  Black  Sea  Bass 
within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  the  depth,  temperature,  and  salinity 
characteristics  present  to  support  the  juvenile  life  stage. 

In  the  spring,  juvenile  Black  Sea  Bass  may  forage  in  more  estuarine  habitats  including  the 
following  areas  of  proposed  dredging  and  in-water  installation  activities:  HCGS  barge  slip, 
barge  storage  and  unloading  facility,  caisson  installation  area,  and  intake  and  discharge 
structures.  Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  in  these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is 
expected  to  be  minor,  temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs  required  by 
Federal  and  State  permits  to  control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Juvenile  Black  Sea 
Bass  that  may  be  present  should  be  able  to  use  adjacent  unaffected  habitats. 

As  described  in  Section  2.3,  a  conservative  estimate  of  impingement  losses  for  the  closed-cycle 
cooling  operation  of  PSEG  would  be  approximately  481 ,479  annually.  The  majority  of  these 
species  are  expected  to  be  White  Perch,  Atlantic  Croaker,  and  Weakfish.  Entrainment  losses 
are  expected  to  be  minor  and  average  less  than  1 25/1 00  m3  intake  water  volume,  with  the 
majority  of  these  losses  being  Bay  Anchovy  (eggs)  and  Naked  Goby  (larvae).  Impingement

Bass  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568; 
PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Thermal  plume  analysis  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  estimates  that  ambient  water 
temperature  in  the  estuary  outside  the  NJPDES-permitted  HDA  may  not  increase  by  more  than 
4°F  (2.2°C)  from  September  through  May  and  by  1 ,5°F  (0.8°C)  from  June  through  August,  with 
a  year-round  maximum  water  temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR  Part  410,  DRBC  201 1- 
TN2371).  Juvenile  Black  Sea  Bass  are  generally  found  in  bottom  habitats  at  depths  between  1 
and  38  m  (3  and  125  ft)  and  could  avoid  the  buoyant  thermal  plume  at  the  discharge  point.  As 
described  in  Section  2.3,  the  size  of  the  thermal  plume  for  a  new  plant  would  be  relatively  small 
and  would  have  a  maximum  extent  of  about  700  ft  into  the  river  from  the  discharge  location, 
about  300  ft  upstream  from  the  discharge,  and  about  500  ft  downstream  from  the  discharge. 
Because  the  horizontal  extent  of  the  thermal  plume  represents  only  5.3  percent  of  the  river 
width  at  Delaware  RM  52,  mobile  organisms  would  be  able  to  avoid  the  localized  point  of 
discharge  and  the  heated  discharge  plume.  Aquatic  species,  including  juvenile  Black  Sea  Bass, 
largely  may  avoid  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  discharge  outlet  because  of  high  velocity  and 
turbulence.  Chemical  discharge  effects  are  expected  to  be  minimal  and  comply  with  the  terms 
of  the  NJPDES  permit  that  would  be  issued  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  due  to  maintenance  dredging  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  expected  to  be  localized,  temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the 
use  of  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State  permits  to  control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  Barge  traffic  effects  are  expected  to  be  localized  and  temporary.  Juvenile  Black  Sea 
Bass  that  may  be  present  should  be  able  to  use  adjacent  unaffected  habitats. 

Black  Sea  Bass  juveniles  primarily  forage  on  benthic  invertebrates,  which  are  not  expected  to 
be  affected  in  the  long  term  from  dredging  and  in-water  installation  activities  as  described  in 
Section  2.2.  In  addition,  these  forage  species  have  not  been  shown  to  be  affected  by 
operations  at  the  adjacent  HCGS  and  SGS,  and  therefore  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  would  not  be  expected  to  reduce  the  abundance  of  the  benthic  invertebrate  prey  species  for 
Black  Sea  Bass.  Thus,  building  and  operation  activities  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  would 
likely  have  minimal  adverse  effect  on  juvenile  Black  Sea  Bass  EFH. 

4.2  Clearnose  Skate 

As  discussed  in  Section  3.2.2,  NMFS  has  designated  EFH  for  juvenile  and  adult  Clearnose 
Skate  within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  the  depth,  temperature,  and  salinity 
characteristics  present  to  support  the  juvenile  and  adult  life  stages. 

Juvenile  and  adult  Clearnose  Skate  may  forage  within  the  areas  of  the  cooling  water  intake  and 
discharge  dredging  and  installation,  caisson  installation  area,  HCGS  barge  slip  improvements 
and  dredging,  and  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility  dredging  and  installation.  Disruption  of 
habitat  for  foraging  in  these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  expected  to  be  minor, 
temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State  permits  to 
control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Juvenile  and  adult  Clearnose  Skate  that  may  be 
present  should  be  able  to  use  adjacent  unaffected  habitats.

As  described  in  Section  2.3,  a  conservative  estimate  of  impingement  losses  for  the  closed-cycle 
cooling  operation  of  PSEG  would  be  approximately  481 ,479  annually.  The  majority  of  these 
species  are  expected  to  be  White  Perch,  Atlantic  Croaker,  and  Weakfish.  Entrainment  losses 
are  expected  to  be  minor  and  average  less  than  125/100  m3,  with  the  majority  of  these  losses 
being  Bay  Anchovy  (eggs)  and  Naked  Goby  (larvae).  Impingement  sampling  at  SGS  and 
HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572),  and  at  SGS  between 
2003  and  2010  recorded  no  occurrences  of  juvenile  or  adult  Clearnose  Skate  (PSEG  2004- 
TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008- 
TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).

a  year-round  maximum  water  temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR  Part  410,  DRBC  2011- 
TN2371).  Juvenile  and  adult  Clearnose  Skate  are  generally  found  in  bottom  habitats  at  depths 
of  5  to  23  m  (16  to  75  ft)  and  would  avoid  the  buoyant  thermal  plume  at  the  discharge  point.  As 
described  in  Section  2.3,  the  size  of  the  thermal  plume  for  a  new  plant  would  be  relatively  small 
and  would  have  a  maximum  extent  of  about  700  ft  into  the  river  from  the  discharge  location, 
about  300  ft  upstream  from  the  discharge,  and  about  500  ft  downstream  from  the  discharge. 
Because  the  horizontal  extent  of  the  thermal  plume  represents  only  5.3  percent  of  the  river 
width  at  Delaware  RM  52,  mobile  organisms  would  be  able  to  avoid  the  heated  discharge

discharge  effects  are  expected  to  be  minimal,  comply  by  the  terms  of  the  NJPDES  permit  that 
would  be  issued  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452),  and  not  affect 
Clearnose  Skate  EFH  for  juveniles  or  adults. 

Disruption  of  habitat  for  prey  species  or  for  foraging  because  of  maintenance  dredging  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  expected  to  be  localized,  temporary,  and  largely 
mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State  permits  to  control  sedimentation 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Barge  traffic  effects  are  also  expected  to  be  localized  and  temporary. 

Clearnose  Skate  juveniles  and  adults  primarily  forage  on  polychaete  worms,  small  crustaceans, 
squid,  and  small  fishes  such  as  Weakfish,  Butterfish,  and  Scup.  While  Butterfish  and  Scup  are 
not  abundant  near  the  PSEG  Site,  Weakfish  are  abundant  and  may  be  impinged  at  a  rate 
similar  to  HCGS,  which  is  roughly  143  individuals  per  one  million  m3  of  intake  water  (see 
Section  5.3.2. 1  of  the  EIS).  However,  Weakfish  was  one  of  the  most  abundant  species  caught 
in  the  Delaware  River  near  the  PSEG  Site  between  2003  and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565; 

PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG 
2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571)  and  would  not  be  expected  to 
decrease  significantly  with  closed-cycle  cooling  water  operation  at  the  PSEG  Site.  In  addition, 
population  abundances  of  these  forage  species  have  not  been  shown  to  be  adversely  affected 
by  operations  at  the  adjacent  HCGS  and  SGS  and  would  therefore  not  be  expected  to  reduce 
the  abundance  of  the  prey  species  for  Clearnose  Skate  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site. 
Therefore,  building  and  operation  activities  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  likely  would  have 
minimal  adverse  effects  on  juvenile  and  adult  Clearnose  Skate  EFH.

4.3  Little  Skate 

As  discussed  in  Section  3.2.3,  NMFS  has  designated  EFH  for  juvenile  and  adult  Little  Skate 
within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  the  depth,  temperature,  and  salinity 
characteristics  present  to  support  juvenile  and  adult  life  stages. 

Juvenile  and  adult  Little  Skate  may  forage  within  the  areas  of  the  cooling  water  intake  and 
discharge  dredging  and  installation,  caisson  installation  area,  HCGS  barge  slip  improvements 
and  dredging,  and  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility  installation  and  dredging.  Disruption  of 
habitat  for  foraging  in  these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  expected  to  be  minor, 
temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs  to  control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  Juvenile  and  adult  Little  Skate  that  may  be  present  should  be  able  to  use  adjacent 
unaffected  habitats. 

As  described  in  Section  2.3,  a  conservative  estimate  of  impingement  losses  for  the  closed-cycle 
cooling  operation  of  PSEG  would  be  approximately  481 ,479  annually.  The  majority  of  these

being  Bay  Anchovy  (eggs)  and  Naked  Goby  (larvae).  Impingement  sampling  at  SGS  and 
HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572),  and  at  SGS  between 
2003  and  2010  recorded  no  occurrences  of  juvenile  or  adult  Little  Skate  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;

a  year-round  maximum  water  temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR  Part  410;  DRBC  2011-

21  m  (13  to  69  ft)  and  would  avoid  the  buoyant  thermal  plume  at  the  discharge  point.  As 
described  in  Section  2.3,  the  size  of  the  thermal  plume  for  a  new  plant  would  be  relatively  small 
and  would  have  a  maximum  extent  of  about  700  ft  into  the  river  from  the  discharge  location, 
about  300  ft  upstream  from  the  discharge,  and  about  500  ft  downstream  from  the  discharge. 
Because  the  horizontal  extent  of  the  mixing  zone  under  slack  tides  represents  only  5.3  percent 
of  the  river  width  at  Delaware  RM  52,  mobile  organisms  would  be  able  to  avoid  the  heated 
discharge  plume.  Aquatic  species,  including  juvenile  and  adult  Little  Skate,  may  largely  avoid

or  adults. 

Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  because  of  maintenance  dredging  in  the  Delaware  River

Little  Skate  juveniles  and  adults  primarily  forage  on  small  crustaceans,  amphipods,  and 
polychaete  worms,  which  are  not  expected  to  be  affected  in  the  long  term  from  dredging  and  in- 
water  installation  activities  as  described  in  Section  2.2.  In  addition,  these  forage  species  have 
not  been  shown  to  be  affected  by  operations  at  the  adjacent  HCGS  and  SGS  and  would

Little  Skate  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  building  and  operation  activities  in  the

EFH. 

4.4  Scup 

As  discussed  in  Section  3.2.4,  NMFS  has  designated  EFH  for  juvenile  and  adult  Scup  within  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  the  depth,  temperature,  and  salinity  characteristics  present 
to  support  the  juvenile  and  adult  life  stages. 

Scup  may  forage  within  the  areas  of  the  cooling  water  intake  and  discharge  dredging  and 
installation,  caisson  installation  area,  HCGS  barge  slip  improvements  and  dredging,  and  barge 
storage  and  unloading  facility  dredging  and  installation.  Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  in 
these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  expected  to  be  minor,  temporary,  and  largely 
mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs  to  control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Juvenile  and 
adult  Scup  that  may  be  present  should  be  able  to  use  adjacent  unaffected  habitats. 

Scup  were  not  observed  in  impingement  sampling  at  SGS  and  HCGS  between  1986  and  1987 
(VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572)  and  were  detected  at  low  abundance  in  impingement 
sampling  at  SGS  between  2003  and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG 
2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010- 
TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Thermal  plume  analysis  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  estimates  that  ambient  water 
temperature  in  the  estuary  outside  the  NJPDES-permitted  HDA  may  not  increase  by  more  than 
4°F  (2.2°C)  from  September  through  May  and  by  1 ,5°F  (0.8°C)  from  June  through  August,  with 
a  year-round  maximum  water  temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR  Part  410;  DRBC  201 1- 
TN2371).  Juvenile  and  adult  Scup  are  generally  found  over  a  range  of  bottom  habitats  at 
depths  between  0  and  185  m  (0  to  607  ft)  and  would  avoid  the  buoyant  thermal  plume  at  the 
discharge  point.  As  described  in  Section  2.3,  the  size  of  the  thermal  plume  for  a  new  plant 
would  be  relatively  small  and  would  have  a  maximum  extent  of  about  700  ft  into  the  river  from 
the  discharge  location,  about  300  ft  upstream  from  the  discharge,  and  about  500  ft  downstream 
from  the  discharge.  Because  the  horizontal  extent  of  the  thermal  plume  represents  only  5.3 
percent  of  the  river  width  at  Delaware  RM  52,  mobile  organisms  would  be  able  to  avoid  the 
heated  discharge  plume.  Aquatic  species,  including  juvenile  and  adult  Scup,  may  largely  avoid 
these  areas  because  of  high  velocities  and  turbulence.  Chemical  discharge  effects  are 
expected  to  be  minimal,  comply  by  the  terms  of  the  NJPDES  permit  that  would  be  issued  for  a 
new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452),  and  are  not  expected  to  affect  Scup  EFH  for 
juveniles  or  adults. 

Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  because  of  maintenance  dredging  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  expected  to  be  localized,  temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the

use  of  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State  permits  to  control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  Barge  traffic  effects  are  also  expected  to  be  localized  and  temporary. 

Scup  juveniles  and  adults  primarily  forage  on  small  crustaceans  and  mollusks,  annelid  worms, 
and  jellyfish,  which  are  not  expected  to  be  affected  in  the  long  term  from  dredging  and  in-water 
installation  activities  described  in  Section  2.2.  In  addition,  these  forage  species  have  not  been 
shown  to  be  affected  by  operations  at  the  adjacent  HCGS  and  SGS  and  would  therefore  not  be 
expected  to  reduce  the  abundance  of  these  prey  species  for  juvenile  and  adult  Scup  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  building  and  operation  activities  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG 
Site  would  likely  have  minimal  adverse  effects  on  juvenile  and  adult  Scup  EFH. 

4.5  Summer  Flounder 

As  discussed  in  Section  3.2.5,  NMFS  has  designated  EFH  for  juvenile  and  adult  Summer 
Flounder  within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  the  depth,  temperature,  and  salinity 
characteristics  present  to  support  the  juvenile  and  adult  life  stages.  Juvenile  and  adult  Summer 
Flounder  may  forage  within  the  areas  of  the  cooling  water  intake  and  discharge  dredging  and 
installation,  caisson  installation  area,  HCGS  barge  slip  improvements  and  dredging,  and  barge 
storage  and  unloading  facility  dredging  and  installation.  Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  in 
these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  expected  to  be  minor,  temporary,  and  largely 
mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs  to  control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Juvenile  and 
adult  Summer  Flounder  that  may  be  present  should  be  able  to  use  adjacent  unaffected  habitats. 
A  total  of  eight  Summer  Flounder  were  collected  during  bottom  trawl  surveys  near  the  PSEG 
Site  between  2003  and  2010,  with  over  300  collected  during  that  same  time  in  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary  to  the  south  of  the  site  in  higher  salinity  waters  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG 
2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009- 
TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Summer  Flounder  were  detected  in  impingement  sampling  at  SGS  and  HCGS  between  1986 
and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572)  and  at  SGS  between  2003  and  2010 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG 
2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).  Between 
2003  and  2010,  an  average  of  1 1 .4  larvae  and  58.6  juveniles  were  entrained  per  year  at  SGS 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG 
2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Thermal  plume  analysis  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  estimates  that  ambient  water 
temperature  in  the  estuary  outside  the  NJPDES-permitted  HDA  may  not  increase  by  more  than 
4°F  (2.2°C)  from  September  through  May  and  by  1 .5°F  (0.8°C)  from  June  through  August,  with 
a  year-round  maximum  water  temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR  Part  410;  DRBC  2011- 
TN2371).  Juvenile  and  adult  Summer  Flounder  are  generally  found  over  a  range  of  bottom 
habitats  at  depths  between  0  and  25  m  (0  and  82  ft)  and  would  avoid  the  buoyant  thermal  plume 
at  the  discharge  point.  As  described  in  Section  2.3,  the  size  of  the  thermal  plume  for  a  new 
plant  would  be  relatively  small  and  would  have  a  maximum  extent  of  about  700  ft  into  the  river 
from  the  discharge  location,  about  300  ft  upstream  from  the  discharge,  and  about  500  ft 
downstream  from  the  discharge.  Because  the  horizontal  extent  of  the  thermal  plume  represents 
only  5.3  percent  of  the  river  width  at  Delaware  RM  52,  mobile  organisms  would  be  able  to  avoid

Appendix  F 


the  heated  discharge  plume.  Aquatic  species,  including  juvenile  and  adult  Summer  Flounder, 
may  largely  avoid  these  areas  because  of  high  velocities  and  turbulence.  Chemical  discharge 
effects  are  expected  to  be  minimal,  comply  by  the  terms  of  the  NJPDES  permit  that  would  be 
issued  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452),  and  not  affect  Summer 
Flounder  EFH  for  juveniles  or  adults. 

Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  because  of  maintenance  dredging  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  expected  to  be  localized,  temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the 
use  of  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State  permits  to  control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  Barge  traffic  effects  are  also  expected  to  be  localized  and  temporary.  Juvenile  and 
adult  Summer  Flounder  that  may  be  present  should  be  able  to  use  adjacent  unaffected  habitats. 

Summer  Flounder  juveniles  and  adults  primarily  forage  on  small  crustaceans,  mollusks,  and 
squid,  which  are  not  expected  to  be  affected  in  the  long  term  from  dredging  and  in-water 
installation  activities  as  described  in  Section  2.2.  In  addition,  these  forage  species  have  not 
been  shown  to  be  affected  by  operations  at  the  adjacent  HCGS  and  SGS  and  would  therefore 
not  be  expected  to  reduce  the  abundance  of  these  prey  species  for  juvenile  and  adult  Summer 
Flounder  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  building  and  operation  activities  in  the 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  would  likely  have  minimal  adverse  effects  on  juvenile  and  adult 
Summer  Flounder  EFH. 

4.6  Windowpane  Flounder 

As  discussed  in  Section  3.2.6,  NMFS  has  designated  EFH  for  Windowpane  eggs,  larvae, 
juveniles,  and  adults  within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  the  depth,  temperature,  and 
salinity  characteristics  present  to  support  the  occurrence  of  these  life  stages. 

Windowpane  Flounder  eggs  are  present  in  surface  waters  over  the  Atlantic  continental  shelf 
beginning  in  February,  with  peak  abundances  occurring  in  the  middle  Atlantic  between  March 
and  October  (Chang  et  al.  1999-TN2133).  Following  offshore  spawning,  eggs  and  larvae  may 
drift  into  estuarine  waters  by  tidal  and  wave  action.  No  Windowpane  eggs  and  very  few  larvae 
were  observed  during  sampling  events  between  2003  and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG 
2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009- 
TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Larvae  drift  along  the  continental  shelf  waters  or  in  estuaries  and  settle  to  the  bottom,  and  it  is 
possible  that  a  few  may  settle  within  the  areas  of  the  cooling  water  intake  and  discharge 
dredging  and  installation,  caisson  installation  area,  HCGS  barge  slip  improvements  and 
dredging,  and  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility  dredging  and  installation.  Disruption  of  larval 
habitat  from  in-water  installation  activities  or  maintenance  dredging  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  expected  to  be  localized,  temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the 
use  of  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State  permits  to  control  sedimentation  and  minimize 
habitat  disruption  during  spawning  and  post-spawning  development  seasons  in  the  spring  and 
early  summer  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Juvenile  and  adult  Windowpane  Flounder  may  forage  within  the  areas  of  the  cooling  water 
intake  and  discharge  dredging  and  installation,  caisson  installation  area,  HCGS  barge  slip

improvements  and  dredging,  and  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  dredging  and 
installation.  Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  in  these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near 
the  PSEG  Site  during  installation  and  maintenance  dredging  is  expected  to  be  localized, 
temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State  permits  to 
control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Barge  traffic  effects  are  also  expected  to  be 
localized  and  temporary.  Juvenile  and  adult  Windowpane  Flounder  that  may  be  present  should 
be  able  to  use  adjacent  unaffected  habitats. 

Two  Windowpane  Flounder  were  collected  during  bottom  trawl  surveys  near  the  PSEG  Site 
between  2003  and  2010,  with  over  600  collected  during  that  same  time  in  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  to  the  south  of  the  site  in  higher  salinity  waters  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005- 
TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009- 
TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Windowpane  Flounder  were  detected  at  low  abundance  in  impingement  sampling  at  SGS  and 
HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572),  and  at  SGS  between 
2003  and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007- 
TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  2011- 
TN2571).  No  Windowpane  eggs  were  collected  from  entrainment  samples  between  2003  and 
2010,  and  an  average  of  0.9  larvae  and  0.25  juveniles  were  entrained  per  year  at  SGS 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG 
2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  201 0-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Thermal  plume  analysis  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  estimates  that  ambient  water 
temperature  in  the  estuary  outside  the  NJPDES-permitted  HDA  may  not  increase  by  more  than 
4°F  (2.2°C)  from  September  through  May  and  by  1 .5°F  (0.8°C)  from  June  through  August,  with 
a  year-round  maximum  water  temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR  Part  410;  DRBC  201 1- 
TN2371 ).  Windowpane  larvae  and  juvenile  and  adult  Windowpane  Flounder  are  generally 
found  over  a  range  of  bottom  habitats  at  depths  between  1  and  100  m  (3  and  328  ft)  and  would 
avoid  the  buoyant  thermal  plume  at  the  discharge  point.  As  described  in  Section  2.3,  the  size  of 
the  thermal  plume  for  a  new  plant  would  be  relatively  small  and  would  have  maximum  extent  of 
about  700  ft  into  the  river  from  the  discharge  location,  about  300  ft  upstream  from  the  discharge, 
and  about  500  ft  downstream  from  the  discharge.  Because  the  horizontal  extent  of  the  thermal 
plume  represents  only  2.3  percent  of  the  river  width  at  Delaware  RM  52,  mobile  organisms 
would  be  able  to  avoid  the  heated  discharge  plume.  Aquatic  species,  including  larval,  juvenile, 
and  adult  Windowpane  Flounder,  may  largely  avoid  these  areas  because  of  high  velocity  and 
turbulence.  Chemical  discharge  effects  are  expected  to  be  minimal  and  comply  by  the  terms  of 
the  NJPDES  permit  that  would  be  issued  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452),  and  are  not  expected  to  affect  Windowpane  Flounder  EFH  for  eggs,  larvae,  juveniles, 
or  adults. 

Windowpane  Flounder  eggs  are  not  known  to  occur  near  the  PSEG  Site  and,  therefore,  there 
would  be  no  adverse  effect  to  Windowpane  egg  EFH  from  building  and  operating  a  new  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  Windowpane  Flounder  larvae  may  occur  near  the  PSEG  Site  in  relatively  low 
abundance  and  would  not  be  affected  in  the  long  term  from  dredging,  in-water  installation 
activities,  and  maintenance  dredging  as  described  in  Section  2.  Therefore,  building  and

Appendix  F 


operation  activities  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  would  likely  have  minimal  adverse  effects  on 
larval  Windowpane  Flounder  EFH. 

Windowpane  Flounder  juveniles  and  adults  primarily  forage  on  small  crustaceans  and  larval 
hakes  and  cods,  which  are  not  expected  to  be  affected  in  the  long  term  from  dredging  and  in¬ 
water  installation  activities  as  described  in  Section  2.2.  In  addition,  these  forage  species  have 
not  been  shown  to  be  affected  by  operations  at  the  adjacent  HCGS  and  SGS  and  would 
therefore  not  be  expected  to  reduce  the  abundance  of  these  prey  species  for  juvenile  and  adult 
Windowpane  Flounder  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  building  and  operation 
activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  likely  have  minimal  adverse  effect  on  juvenile  and  adult 
Windowpane  Flounder  EFH. 

4.7  Winter  Flounder 

As  discussed  in  Section  3.2.7,  NMFS  has  designated  EFH  for  Winter  Flounder  eggs,  larvae, 
juveniles,  and  adults  within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  the  depth,  temperature,  and 
salinity  characteristics  present  to  support  the  occurrence  of  these  life  stages. 

Winter  Flounder  eggs  are  present  in  clumps  that  sink  to  the  bottom  and  can  be  found  in  water 
depth  of  less  than  5  m  (16  ft)  between  February  and  June  (Buckley  1989-TN2833).  No  Winter 
Flounder  eggs  were  observed  during  sampling  events  between  2003  and  2010  (PSEG  2004- 
TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008- 
TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Larvae  are  initially  planktonic  but  become  benthic  as  they  mature,  and  a  small  number  of  Winter 
Flounder  larvae  may  settle  in  areas  within  the  area  of  the  cooling  water  intake  and  discharge 
dredging  and  installation,  caisson  installation  area,  and  barge  slip  and  new  barge  facility 
dredging.  Disruption  of  larval  habitat  from  in-water  installation  activities  or  maintenance 
dredging  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  at  the  PSEG  Site  is  expected  to  be  localized, 
temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State  permits  to 
control  sedimentation  and  minimize  habitat  disruption  during  spawning  and  post-spawning 
development  seasons  in  the  spring  and  early  summer  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Juvenile  and  adult  Winter  Flounder  may  forage  within  area  of  the  cooling  water  intake  and 
discharge  dredging  and  installation,  caisson  installation  area,  HCGS  barge  slip  improvements 
and  dredging,  and  barge  storage  and  unloading  facility  improvements  and  dredging.  Disruption 
of  habitat  for  foraging  in  these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is  expected  to  be  minor, 
temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs  required  by  Federal  and  State  permits  to 
control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Barge  traffic  effects  are  also  expected  to  be 
localized  and  temporary.  Juvenile  and  adult  Winter  Flounder  that  may  be  present  should  be 
able  to  use  adjacent  unaffected  habitats.  No  Winter  Flounder  were  collected  during  bottom 
trawl  surveys  near  the  PSEG  Site  between  2003  and  2010,  while  over  50  were  collected  during 
that  same  time  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  to  the  south  of  the  site  in  higher  salinity  waters 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG 
2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).

Winter  Flounder  were  detected  at  low  abundance  in  impingement  sampling  at  SGS  and  HCGS 
between  1986  and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572)  and  at  SGS  between  2003 
and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-

TN2571).  No  Winter  Flounder  eggs  were  collected  from  entrainment  samples  between  2003 
and  2010,  and  an  average  of  1 .5  larvae  and  1 .0  juveniles  were  entrained  per  year  at  SGS 
(PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG 
2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ). 

Thermal  plume  analysis  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  estimates  that  ambient  water 
temperature  in  the  estuary  outside  the  NJPDES-permitted  HDA  may  not  increase  by  more  than 
4°F  (2.2°C)  from  September  through  May  and  by  1 .5°F  (0.8°C)  from  June  through  August,  with 
a  year-round  maximum  water  temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR  410-TN3235;  DRBC  2011- 
TN2371).  Larval,  juvenile,  and  adult  Winter  Flounder  are  generally  found  over  a  range  of 
bottom  habitats  at  depths  between  1  and  100  m  (3  and  328  ft)  and  would  avoid  the  buoyant 
thermal  plume  at  the  discharge  point.  As  described  in  Section  2.3,  the  size  of  the  thermal  plume 
for  a  new  plant  would  be  relatively  small  and  would  have  a  maximum  extent  of  about  700  ft  into 
the  river  from  the  discharge  location,  about  300  ft  upstream  from  the  discharge,  and  about  500  ft 
downstream  from  the  discharge.  Because  the  horizontal  extent  of  the  thermal  plume  represents 
only  5.3  percent  of  the  river  width  at  Delaware  RM  52,  mobile  organisms  would  be  able  to  avoid 
the  heated  discharge  plume.  Aquatic  species,  including  larval,  juvenile,  and  adult  Winter 
Flounder,  largely  may  avoid  these  areas  because  of  high  velocities  and  turbulence.  Chemical 
discharge  effects  are  expected  to  be  minimal,  comply  by  the  terms  of  the  NJPDES  permit  that 
would  be  issued  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452),  and  not  affect  Winter 
Flounder  EFH  for  eggs,  larvae,  juveniles,  or  adults. 

Winter  Flounder  eggs  are  not  known  to  occur  near  the  PSEG  Site  and  therefore,  there  would  be 
no  adverse  effect  to  Winter  Flounder  egg  EFH  from  building  and  operating  activities  at  the 
PSEG  Site.  Winter  Flounder  larvae  and  juveniles  feed  on  diatoms  and  phytoplankton,  while 
older  juveniles  and  adults  primarily  forage  on  small  crustaceans,  annelid  worms,  and  small 
mollusks,  which  are  not  expected  to  be  affected  in  the  long  term  from  dredging  and  in-water 
installation  activities  as  described  in  Section  2.2.  In  addition,  these  forage  species  have  not 
been  shown  to  be  affected  by  operations  at  the  adjacent  HCGS  and  SGS  and  would  therefore 
not  be  expected  to  reduce  the  abundance  of  these  prey  species  for  juvenile  and  adult 
Windowpane  Flounder  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  building  and  operation 
activities  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  would  likely  have  minimal  adverse  effect  on  larval, 
juvenile,  and  adult  Windowpane  Flounder  EFH. 

4.8  Winter  Skate 

As  discussed  in  Section  3.2.8,  NMFS  has  designated  EFH  for  juvenile  and  adult  Winter  Skate 
within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  because  of  the  depth,  temperature,  and  salinity 
characteristics  present  to  support  the  juvenile  and  adult  life  stages. 

Although  no  Winter  Skate  were  collected  near  the  PSEG  Site  during  trawling  and  seining 
surveys  between  2003  and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006- 
TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-

Appendix  F 


TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ),  Winter  Skate  may  still  forage  within  the  area  of  the  cooling 
water  intake  and  discharge  dredging  and  installation,  caisson  installation  area,  HCGS  barge  slip 
improvements  and  dredging,  and  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  improvements  and 
dredging.  Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  in  these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  is 
expected  to  be  minor,  temporary,  and  largely  mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs  required  for 
Federal  and  State  permits  to  control  sedimentation  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Barge  traffic  effects 
are  also  expected  to  be  localized  and  temporary.  Juvenile  and  adult  Winter  Skate  that  may  be 
present  should  be  able  to  use  adjacent  unaffected  habitats. 

Winter  Skate  were  not  observed  in  impingement  sampling  at  SGS  and  HCGS  between  1986 
and  1987  (VJSA  1988-TN2564;  ECS  1989-TN2572)  or  in  impingement  sampling  at  SGS 
between  2003  and  2010  (PSEG  2004-TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567; 
PSEG  2007-TN2568:  PSEG  2008-TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG 
201 1-TN2571). 

Thermal  plume  analysis  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  estimates  that  ambient  water 
temperature  in  the  estuary  outside  the  NJPDES-permitted  HDA  may  not  increase  by  more  than 
4°F  (2.2°C)  from  September  through  May  and  by  1 ,5°F  (0.8°C)  from  June  through  August,  with 
a  year-round  maximum  water  temperature  of  86°F  (30°C)  (18  CFR  Part  410;  DRBC  201 1  - 
TN237 1 ).  Juvenile  and  adult  Winter  Skate  are  generally  found  over  a  range  of  bottom  habitats 
at  depths  between  7  and  18  m  (23  and  59  ft)  and  would  avoid  the  buoyant  thermal  plume  at  the 
discharge  point.  As  described  in  Section  2.3,  the  size  of  the  thermal  plume  for  a  new  plant 
would  be  relatively  small  and  would  have  a  maximum  extent  of  about  700  ft  into  the  river  from 
the  discharge  location,  about  300  ft  upstream  from  the  discharge,  and  about  500  ft  downstream 
from  the  discharge.  Because  the  horizontal  extent  of  the  thermal  plume  represents  only  5.3 
percent  of  the  river  width  at  Delaware  RM  52,  mobile  organisms  would  be  able  to  avoid  the 
heated  discharge  plume.  Aquatic  species,  including  juvenile  and  adult  Winter  Skate,  may 
largely  avoid  these  areas  because  of  high  velocity  and  turbulence.  Chemical  discharge  effects 
are  expected  to  be  minimal,  comply  by  the  terms  of  the  NJPDES  permit  that  would  be  issued  for 
a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452),  and  not  affect  Winter  Skate  EFH  for 
juveniles  or  adults. 

Winter  Skate  juveniles  and  adults  primarily  forage  on  polychaete  worm  and  amphipods,  which 
are  not  expected  to  be  affected  in  the  long  term  from  dredging  and  in-water  installation  activities 
as  described  in  Section  2.2.  In  addition,  these  forage  species  have  not  been  shown  to  be 
affected  by  operations  at  the  adjacent  HCGS  and  SGS  and  would  therefore  not  be  expected  to 
reduce  the  abundance  of  these  prey  species  for  juvenile  and  adult  Winter  Skate  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  PSEG  Site.  Therefore,  building  and  operation  activities  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  likely 
would  have  no  adverse  effect  on  juvenile  and  adult  Winter  Skate  EFH. 

5.0  CUMULATIVE  EFFECTS  TO  EFH 

A  wide  variety  of  historical  events  have  affected  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin  and  its 
resources  (Berger  et  al.  1994-TN2127).  As  Europeans  began  settling  the  estuary  region  early 
in  the  17th  century,  agriculture  expanded,  and  the  clearing  of  forest  led  to  erosion.  Dredging, 
diking,  and  filling  gradually  altered  extensive  areas  of  shoreline  and  tidal  marsh.  By  the  late 
1 800s,  industrialization  had  altered  much  of  the  watershed  of  the  upper  estuary,  and  fisheries

were  declining  because  of  overfishing  as  well  as  pollution  from  ships,  sewers,  and  industry.  By 
the  1940s,  anadromous  fish  were  blocked  from  migrating  upstream  to  spawn  because  of  a 
barrier  of  low  oxygen  levels  in  the  Philadelphia  area.  This  barrier,  combined  with  small  dams  on 
tributaries,  nearly  destroyed  the  herring  and  shad  fisheries.  A  large  increase  in  industrial 
pollution  in  the  early-to-mid  1900s  resulted  in  the  Delaware  River  near  Philadelphia  becoming 
one  of  the  most  polluted  river  reaches  in  the  world.  Major  improvements  in  water  quality  began 
in  the  1960s  and  continued  through  the  1980s  as  a  result  of  State,  multi-State,  and  Federal 
actions,  including  the  Clean  Water  Act  and  the  activities  of  DRBC  (PDE  201 2-TN21 91 ).  The 
Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin  is  the  subject  of  numerous  restoration  activities  and  projects 
under  the  purview  of  the  Partnership  for  the  Delaware  Estuary  (PDE),  DRBC,  and  numerous 
research  and  academic  institutions.  In  its  2012  annual  report,  PDE  suggested  that  the  overall 
environmental  conditions  of  the  region  were  fair  (PDE  2012-TN2191 ).  Since  2008,  some 
conditions  were  found  to  be  declining  in  areas  such  as  sediment  removal  impairing  estuarine 
habitats  and  a  decline  in  young-of-year  Atlantic  Sturgeon  (Acipenser  oxyrinchus  oxyrinchus), 
and  some  areas  were  seeing  improvements  such  as  a  reduction  of  total  organic  carbon  and  an 
increase  in  Striped  Bass  populations  (PDE  2012-TN2191 ). 

Other  actions  in  the  vicinity  that  have  present  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  impacts  on  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  include  the  continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  the  completion  of 
dredging  operations  for  the  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  by  the  USACE, 
and  potential  construction  of  a  new  transmission  corridor  and  transmission  line  by  PJM 
Interconnection,  LLC,  for  grid  stability.  Planning  and  development  for  the  new  transmission 
corridor  would  avoid  or  span  channelized  waterways,  perennial  streams,  and  intermittent 
streams  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  New  transmission  line  crossing  development  would  require 
BMPs  to  protect  water  quality  and  minimize  effects  to  aquatic  habitats  that  may  be  at  risk  from 
clearing  activities,  runoff,  and  bank  erosion.  An  estimated  77,088  linear  ft  of  stream  habitat 
(S&L  2010-TN2671)  is  within  the  5-mi-wide  macro-corridor  for  the  hypothetical  transmission  line 
discussed  in  EIS  Sections  7.1  and  7.3.2.  The  hypothetical  transmission  line  would  cross  the 
Delaware  River  and  would  require  installation  of  footings.  Placement  of  footings  would  result  in 
permanent  benthic  habitat  loss,  but  this  loss  would  be  minimal  when  compared  with  available 
adjacent  habitat.  Installation  activities  would  be  managed  through  use  of  BMPs  required  for 
Federal  and  State  permitting  to  minimize  siltation  and  protect  adjacent  aquatic  habitats.  PSEG 
would  consult  with  Federal  and  State  agencies,  as  required,  when  an  exact  route  is  identified 
and  installation  effects  to  protected  species  can  be  assessed  directly  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 
Water  quality  in  the  region  may  be  affected  by  continued  withdrawal  and  discharge  of  water  to 
support  power  generation.  There  are  large  commercial  and  recreational  fisheries  that  harvest 
fish  and  invertebrates  that  make  up  the  ecological  community  within  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary.  The  effects  of  natural  environmental  stressors  such  as  climate  change  and  extreme 
weather  events  also  would  affect  aquatic  communities  in  the  region. 

Each  of  the  current  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  may  influence  the  structure  and 
function  of  estuarine  food  webs  and  result  in  observable  changes  to  the  aquatic  resources  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary.  In  most  cases,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  quantitatively  the  impact 
of  individual  stressors  or  groups  of  stressors  on  aquatic  resources  because  they  affect  the 
region  simultaneously,  and  their  effects  are  cumulative.

5.1  Continued  Operation  of  the  SGS  Once-Through  Cooling  System 

Based  on  the  assessment  presented  in  the  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for 
License  Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants-Supplement  45  Regarding  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station 
and  Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2  Final  Report  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ),  NRC 
staff  concluded  that  "entrainment,  impingement,  and  thermal  discharge  impacts  on  aquatic 
resources  from  the  operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  collectively  have  not  had  a  noticeable 
adverse  effect  on  the  balanced  indigenous  community  of  the  Delaware  Estuary.”  However, 
operation  of  SGS  Units  1  and  2  continues  to  impinge  and  entrain  aquatic  species  and  would 
contribute,  in  part,  to  the  cumulative  loss  of  these  species  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 
Several  improvements  to  the  cooling  water  intake  structures  have  been  made  to  reduce 
impingement  mortality  at  SGS.  Some  of  these  improvements  included  installation  of  modified 
traveling  screens,  installation  of  improved  screen  mesh,  and  modifications  to  spray  wash  nozzle 
configurations  (PSEG  2009-TN2513).  Decades  of  monitoring  and  survey  data  for  finfish  and 
aquatic  invertebrates  have  been  used  to  assess  species  density  and  richness  in  the  vicinity  of 
SGS  as  directed  under  NJPDES  permits  starting  in  1994  and  subsequent  renewals 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Impingement,  entrainment,  and  fish  assemblage  sampling  by  trawling 
and  seining  are  conducted  each  year,  in  accordance  with  NJDPES  permit  requirements  for 
biological  monitoring.  The  reporting  emphasis  is  on  targeted  representative  important  species 
that  include  Blueback  Herring,  Alewife  (Alosa  pseudoharengus),  American  Shad,  Atlantic 
Menhaden,  Bay  Anchovy,  Atlantic  Silverside,  White  Perch,  Striped  Bass,  Bluefish,  Weakfish, 
Spot  (Leiostomus  xanthurus),  and  Atlantic  Croaker  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  All  of  these 
representative  important  species  also  are  considered  either  recreationally  or  commercially 
important  or  are  ecologically  important  as  forage  fish  for  sustainability  of  the  ecosystem  within 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  They  discussed  in  more  detail  in  EIS  Section  2. 4. 2. 3.  Although 
individual  species  abundances  change  year  to  year,  the  overall  trends  in  community 
abundances  and  diversity  show  no  significant  changes  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

5.2  Continued  Operation  of  the  HCGS  Closed-Cycle  Cooling  System 

HCGS  uses  closed-cycle  cooling  and  therefore  requires  substantially  less  water  volume  for 
cooling  operations.  Accordingly,  effects  on  the  aquatic  community  through  impingement, 
entrainment,  and  discharge  also  are  expected  to  be  reduced  when  compared  with  the  once- 
through  cooling  system  at  SGS  (NRC  201 1-TN3131 ).  Impingement  studies  at  HCGS  were 
performed  only  in  1986  and  1987  at  the  commencement  of  operation  for  the  single  unit  and 
showed  a  reduced  overall  impingement  rate  when  compared  to  SGS  (see  EIS  Section  5.3.2). 
EFH  species  impinged  at  HCGS  between  1986  and  1987  included  Black  Sea  Bass,  Summer 
Flounder,  Windowpane  Flounder,  and  Winter  Flounder.  Because  HCGS  was  operating 
concurrently  with  SGS,  the  NJPDES  permit-directed  biological  monitoring  of  the  aquatic 
community  through  trawling  and  seining  studies  also  reflected  the  combined  effect  of  both 
HCGS  and  SGS  operations.  Therefore,  the  conclusions  regarding  effect  of  continued  operation 
of  SGS  apply  also  to  HCGS  in  that  the  overall  species  diversity  and  community  abundances 
near  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  continue  to  show  no  noticeable  effects  from  operations 
(NRC  201 1-TN3131 ).

5.3  Commercial  and  Recreational  Harvest  of  Fish  and  Shellfish 

The  Delaware  River  Estuary  supports  a  diverse  commercial  and  recreational  fishery  for  finfish 
and  invertebrates.  Losses  to  the  ecosystem  from  fishery  harvest  are  managed  at  the  Federal 
and  State  levels  through  catch  limits,  regulations  on  fishing  gear,  and  seasonal  closures. 
Unintended  harvest  or  mortality  is  another  source  of  loss  through  bycatch  while  targeting  a 
different  species.  While  these  activities  have  the  potential  to  contribute  to  cumulative  effects  on 
aquatic  species  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  the  direct  contribution  is  difficult  to  assess 
because  many  of  these  fish  populations  have  life  histories  that  involve  a  large  migratory  territory 
offshore  and  along  the  Atlantic  coast  of  the  United  States,  and  therefore,  effects  to  populations 
are  difficult  to  attribute  directly  to  Delaware  River  Estuary  habitat  effects. 

5.4  Habitat  Loss  and  Restoration 

Current  and  future  land  use  development  for  industry,  agriculture,  or  other  habitat  alterations  in 
the  Delaware  River  Estuary  watershed  may  affect  water  quality.  These  types  of  activities  also 
may  result  in  shoreline  habitat  loss. 

Dredging  activities  from  past  efforts  to  maintain  navigation  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  may 
have  affected  estuarine  habitats,  and  planned  dredging  activities  may  continue  to  affect  the 
aquatic  ecosystem.  Starting  in  2010,  the  USACE  began  implementing  the  Delaware  River  Main 
Channel  Deepening  Project  to  deepen  the  existing  navigation  channel  from  40  to  45  ft 
(USACE  201 1-TN2262).  To  deepen  the  channel,  material  would  be  dredged  by  hydraulic  and 
hopper  dredges  and  placed  in  USACE  CDFs  or  used  for  beneficial  reuse  purposes  (e.g., 
wetland  and  beach  restoration  or  habitat  creation)  in  lower  Delaware  Bay.  The  USACE 
estimates  that  1 ,01 2,428  yd3  of  material  were  dredged  from  Reach  D  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  near  Artificial  Island  and  placed  in  the  Federally-owned  Artificial  Island  CDF 
(USACE  2013-TN2851 ).  When  completed,  the  entire  deepening  project  would  remove  and 
dispose  of  an  estimated  16  million  yd3  of  sediments  from  the  Delaware  River  in  Philadelphia 
down  to  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  Bay.  The  subsequent  maintenance  dredging  would  remove 
an  estimated  4,31 7,000  yd3  of  sediment  from  the  45-ft-deep  channel  each  year  (USACE  2011- 
TN2262).  Maintenance  dredging  would  be  carried  out  as  needed,  generally  over  a  2-month 
period  between  August  and  December.  As  with  building  in-river  components  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  fish  and  benthic  invertebrates  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary 
would  be  displaced  during  the  USACE  dredging  activities  but  are  expected  to  recolonize  the 
affected  areas.  The  USACE  would  implement  appropriate  measures  required  by  Federal  and 
State  agencies  and  organizations  to  protect  aquatic  resources,  including  endangered  species 
(sturgeon  and  sea  turtles),  sharks,  horseshoe  crabs  (Limulus  polyphemus),  blue  crabs, 
freshwater  mussels,  and  American  Eels  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  For  example,  mechanical 
dredge  activities  between  March  15  and  June  30  would  be  avoided  within  selected  reaches  of 
the  project  area  to  prevent  sedimentation  and  turbidity  effects  on  reproduction  of  Atlantic 
Sturgeon,  Striped  Bass,  American  Shad,  and  river  herring  (USACE  2013-TN2851 ). 

While  aquatic  habitats  continue  to  be  affected  by  natural  and  anthropogenic  activities  in  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary,  efforts  to  restore  salt  marsh  and  estuary  habitat  have  met  with  some 
success  and  are  expected  to  continue.  For  example,  ongoing  restoration  activities  within  the 
Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA,  which  is  located  4  mi  east  of  the  PSEG  Site,  would  restore  nearly  200

ac  of  the  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA  to  address  injuries  to  shoreline  and  bird  resources  resulting 
from  the  2004  Athos  /  oil  spill  (NOAA  2008-TN2721 ).  NJDEP  and  the  National  Oceanic  and 
Atmospheric  Administration  (NOAA)  proposed  a  tidal  wetland  restoration  project  that  would 
allow  development  of  smooth  cordgrass  ( Spartina  alterniflora)  habitat  to  improve  habitat  quality 
in  the  area.  Restoration  would  be  accomplished  through  fill  material  removal  to  lower  the  marsh 
elevation  and  allow  tidal  inundation  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  As  described  in  EIS  Section  4.3.1, 
unavoidable  impacts  to  wetlands  during  development  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  mitigated  by  habitat  restoration  and  enhancement, 
using  experience  and  proven  techniques  developed  by  the  PSEG  EEP.  Sensitive  species  that 
utilize  such  marsh  habitats  would  be  positively  affected  by  the  proposed  Mad  Horse  Creek 
WMA  restoration  effort  and  by  the  proposed  mitigation  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  and  causeway  (i.e.,  restoration  of  low  quality  marsh  habitats)  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

5.5  Climate  Change 

The  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  aquatic  organisms  and  habitat  in  the  geographic 
area  of  interest  are  not  precisely  known.  In  addition  to  rising  sea  levels,  climate  change  could 
lead  to  regional  increases  in  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  precipitation  events, 
increases  in  annual  precipitation,  and  increases  in  average  temperature  (GCRP  2014-TN3472). 
Such  changes  in  climate  could  alter  aquatic  community  composition  on  or  near  the  PSEG  Site 
through  changes  in  species  diversity,  abundance,  and  distribution.  In  2012,  Hurricane  Sandy 
created  increased  storm  surge  during  this  event  within  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  had 
moderate  effects  on  water  quality  and  coastal  habitats  within  the  southernmost  portion  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary  through  erosion,  sedimentation,  and  resuspension  of  contaminants 
within  sediments  (ALS  2012-TN2720).  Elevated  water  temperatures,  droughts,  and  severe 
weather  phenomena  could  adversely  affect  or  severely  reduce  aquatic  habitat;  however, 
specific  predictions  on  aquatic  habitat  changes  in  this  region  due  to  climate  change  are 
inconclusive  at  this  time.  The  level  of  impact  resulting  from  these  events  would  depend  on  the 
intensity  of  the  perturbation  and  the  resiliency  of  the  aquatic  communities.  The  DRBC  stated  in 
the  State  of  the  Delaware  River  Basin  report  for  2013  that  increases  in  temperature  and  salinity 
are  expected  with  future  sea-level  rise  and  climate  change  (DRBC  2013-TN2609).  These 
potential  changes  are  likely  to  result  in  movement  of  populations  of  more  marine  and  euryhaline 
species  farther  up  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  For  example,  in  a  recent  report,  hard  bottom 
areas  north  and  south  of  the  Chesapeake  and  Delaware  Canal  (upriver  of  the  PSEG  Site)  were 
identified  as  having  potential  as  reef  sites  for  the  establishment  of  new  oyster  beds  and  were 
discussed  as  a  future  conservation  target  due  to  changing  climate  conditions  resulting  in 
increases  in  salinity  farther  upriver  (PDE  201 1-TN2190). 

5.6  Summary  of  Cumulative  Impacts 

Aquatic  resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  are  cumulatively  affected  to  varying  degrees 
by  multiple  activities  and  processes  that  have  occurred  in  the  past,  are  occurring  currently,  and 
are  likely  to  occur  in  the  future.  The  food  web  and  the  abundance  of  important  aquatic  forage 
species  and  other  species  have  been  substantially  affected  by  these  stressors  historically  as  is 
described  in  Section  2.4.2.  The  impacts  of  some  of  these  stressors  associated  with  human 
activities  are  addressed  by  management  actions  (e.g.,  cooling  system  operation,  regulation  of 
fishing  pressure,  water  quality  improvements,  and  habitat  restoration).

Other  stressors,  such  as  climate  change  as  well  as  increased  human  population  and  associated 
development  in  the  Delaware  River  Basin,  cannot  be  managed  directly,  and  their  effects  are 
more  difficult  to  quantify  and  predict.  It  is  likely,  however,  that  future  anthropogenic  and  natural 
environmental  stressors  would  cumulatively  affect  the  aquatic  community  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  so  as  to  noticeably  alter  important  attributes,  such  as  species  ranges,  populations, 
diversity,  habitats,  and  ecosystem  processes,  just  as  they  have  in  the  past.  These  stressors 
have  modified  important  attributes  of  aquatic  resources  and  would  continue  to  exert  an  influence 
in  the  future,  potentially  destabilizing  some  of  the  attributes  of  the  aquatic  ecosystem.  Based  on 
these  observations,  the  review  team  concludes  that  cumulative  impacts  have  been  noticeable 
and  destabilizing  for  some  aquatic  resources,  primarily  based  on  past  stressors  affecting 
aquatic  resources  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  and  River  Basin. 

Cumulative  impacts  on  aquatic  ecology  resources  are  estimated  based  on  the  information 
provided  by  PSEG,  NMFS,  and  the  review  team’s  independent  review.  The  significant  history  of 
the  degradation  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  has  had  a  noticeable  and  sometimes 
destabilizing  effect  on  many  aquatic  species  and  communities.  Commencement  of  operations 
at  SGS  Units  1  and  2  resulted  in  significant  numbers  of  aquatic  species  being  entrained  and 
impinged,  which  led  to  required  restoration  of  the  area  through  the  PSEG  EEP  as  a  form  of 
mitigation.  In  addition,  present  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  activities  such  as  the 
continued  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS  and  the  completion  of  dredging  operations  for  the 
Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  would  continue  to  have  effects  on  the  aquatic 
resources  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  However,  the  review  team  concludes  that  the 
incremental  contribution  of  the  NRC-authorized  activities  related  to  construction  and  operation 
of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  negligible. 

6.0  CONCLUSIONS 

Conclusions  regarding  PSEG  adverse  effects  on  EFH  are  addressed  in  the  following  sections 
by  species  and  provided  in  Table  5.  All  conclusions  are  made  for  the  PSEG  Site  development, 
operation,  and  cumulative  effects  within  the  region. 

6.1  Black  Sea  Bass 

The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have 
minimal  adverse  effect  on  Black  Sea  Bass  juvenile  EFH.  The  review  team  concludes  that 
installation  activities  and  dredging  may  cause  localized  disruption  to  foraging  activity  in  those 
areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Juvenile  Black  Sea  Bass  would  be  able  to  forage  in 
adjacent,  unaffected  habitat  during  the  temporary  period  of  in-water  work.  In  addition,  a  new 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  may  impinge  a  small  number  of  juvenile  Black  Sea  Bass  each  year 
based  on  the  impingement  rates  for  HCGS,  which  uses  a  closed-cycle  cooling  design  similar  to 
that  proposed  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  these  impingement  losses  are  minor, 
and  the  review  team  expects  that  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  affect 
longer  term  species  abundance  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.

6.2  Clearnose  Skate 

The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have 
minimal  adverse  effect  on  Clearnose  Skate  juvenile  and  adult  EFH.  The  review  team  concludes 
that  installation  and  dredging  activities  are  not  likely  to  affect  juvenile  or  adult  Clearnose  Skate 
as  this  species  has  not  been  collected  or  reported  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  In  addition, 
intake  and  discharge  operations  also  are  not  likely  to  affect  juvenile  or  adult  Clearnose  Skate  as 
this  species  has  not  been  observed  in  impingement  sampling  at  HCGS  and  SGS.  However, 
Clearnose  Skate  juveniles  and  adults  prey  on  Weakfish,  which  is  expected  to  be  impinged  at  a 
new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  based  on  Weakfish  impingement  rates  for  the  similar  closed-cycle 
cooling  system  at  HCGS.  These  prey  impingement  losses  are  expected  to  be  minor  and  would 
not  affect  longer  term  Clearnose  Skate  population  abundance  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

6.3  Little  Skate 

The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  no 
adverse  effect  on  Little  Skate  juvenile  and  adult  EFH.  The  review  team  concludes  that 
installation  and  dredging  activities  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  not  likely  to  affect 
juvenile  or  adult  Little  Skate  as  this  species  has  not  been  collected  or  reported  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  PSEG  Site.  In  addition,  intake  and  discharge  operations  are  also  not  likely  to  affect  juvenile 
or  adult  Little  Skate  as  this  species  has  not  been  observed  in  impingement  sampling  at  the 
nearby  HCGS  and  SGS. 

6.4  Scup 

The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have 
minimal  adverse  effect  on  Scup  juvenile  and  adult  EFH.  The  review  team  concludes  that 
installation  activities  and  dredging  may  cause  localized  disruption  to  foraging  activity  in  those 
areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Juvenile  and  adult  Scup  would  be  able  to  forage  in 
adjacent,  unaffected  habitat  during  the  temporary  period  of  in-water  work.  In  addition,  a  new 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  may  impinge  a  small  number  of  juvenile  and  adult  Scup  each  year  based 
on  the  impingement  rates  for  HCGS,  which  uses  a  closed-cycle  cooling  design  similar  to  that 
proposed  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  these  impingement  losses  are  minor,  and 
the  review  team  expects  that  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  affect  longer 
term  species  abundance  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

6.5  Summer  Flounder 

The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have 
minimal  adverse  effect  on  Summer  Flounder  juvenile  and  adult  EFH.  The  review  team 
concludes  that  installation  activities  and  dredging  may  cause  localized  disruption  to  foraging 
activity  in  those  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Juvenile  and  adult  Summer  Flounder 
would  be  able  to  forage  in  adjacent,  unaffected  habitat  during  the  temporary  period  of  in-water 
work.  Although  a  small  number  of  Summer  Flounder  juveniles  were  entrained  at  SGS,  a  new 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  use  closed-cycle  cooling  with  reduced  intake  volume  and  velocity, 
as  opposed  to  the  once-through  cooling  used  at  SGS.  In  addition,  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
may  impinge  a  small  number  of  juvenile  and  adult  Summer  Flounder  each  year  based  on  the

impingement  rates  for  HCGS,  which  uses  a  closed-cycle  cooling  design  similar  to  that  proposed 
for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  these  impingement  losses  are  minor,  and  the 
review  team  expects  that  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  affect  longer  term 
species  abundance  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

6.6  Windowpane  Flounder 

The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  no 
adverse  effect  on  Windowpane  Flounder  EFH  for  eggs.  The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  entrain  Windowpane  eggs  because  they  have  not  been 
collected  or  reported  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  or  from  impingement  and  entrainment 
sampling  at  the  nearby  SGS. 

The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  a  minimal  adverse 
effect  on  larval,  juvenile,  and  adult  Windowpane  Flounder  EFH.  The  review  team  concludes 
that  installation  activities  and  dredging  may  cause  localized  disruption  to  benthic  habitat  and 
juvenile  and  adult  foraging  activity  in  those  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Juvenile  and 
adult  Windowpane  Flounder  would  be  able  to  forage  in  adjacent,  unaffected  habitat  during  the 
temporary  period  of  in-water  work. 

Although  a  small  number  of  Windowpane  Flounder  larvae  and  juveniles  were  entrained  at  SGS, 
a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  use  closed-cycle  cooling  with  reduced  intake  volume  and 
velocity,  as  opposed  to  the  once-through  cooling  used  at  SGS.  In  addition,  a  new  plant  at  the 
PSEG  Site  may  impinge  a  small  number  of  juvenile  and  adult  Windowpane  each  year  based  on 
the  impingement  rates  for  HCGS,  which  uses  a  closed-cycle  cooling  design  similar  to  that 
proposed  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  these  impingement  losses  are  minor,  and 
the  review  team  expects  that  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  affect  longer 
term  species  abundance  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

6.7  Winter  Flounder 

The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  no 
adverse  effect  on  Winter  Flounder  EFH  for  eggs.  The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  plant 
at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  entrain  Winter  Flounder  eggs  because  they  have  not  been  collected 
or  reported  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  or  from  impingement  and  entrainment  sampling  at 
the  nearby  SGS. 

The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  a  minimal  adverse 
effect  on  larval,  juvenile,  and  adult  Winter  Flounder  EFH.  The  review  team  concludes  that 
installation  activities  and  dredging  may  cause  localized  disruption  to  benthic  habitat  and  juvenile 
and  adult  foraging  activity  in  those  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary.  Juvenile  and  adult 
Winter  Flounder  would  be  able  to  forage  in  adjacent,  unaffected  habitat  during  the  temporary 
period  of  in-water  work. 

Although  a  small  number  of  Winter  Flounder  larvae  and  juveniles  were  entrained  at  SGS,  a  new 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  use  closed-cycle  cooling  with  reduced  intake  volume  and  velocity, 
as  opposed  to  the  once-through  cooling  used  at  SGS.  In  addition,  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site

may  impinge  a  small  number  of  juvenile  and  adult  Winter  Flounder  each  year  based  on  the 
impingement  rates  for  HCGS,  which  uses  a  closed-cycle  cooling  design  similar  to  that  proposed 
for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  these  impingement  losses  are  minor,  and  the 
review  team  expects  that  operation  of  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  affect  longer  term 
species  abundance  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

6.8  Winter  Skate 

The  review  team  concludes  that  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  no 
adverse  effect  on  Winter  Skate  juvenile  and  adult  EFH.  The  review  team  concludes  that 
installation  and  dredging  activities  for  a  new  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  not  likely  to  affect 
juvenile  or  adult  Winter  Skate  as  this  species  has  not  been  collected  or  reported  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  PSEG  Site.  In  addition,  intake  and  discharge  operations  are  also  not  likely  to  affect  juvenile 
or  adult  Winter  Skate  as  this  species  has  not  been  observed  in  impingement  and  entrainment 
sampling  at  the  nearby  HCGS  and  SGS.

1.0  INTRODUCTION 

The  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  review  team  is  reviewing  an  application 
submitted  by  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP) 
for  a  site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and  Salem

Generating  Station  (SGS),  Units  1  and  2,  on  the  eastern  shore  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in 
Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township.  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  As  part  of  its  review  of  the  ESP 
application,  the  NRC  is  preparing  an  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  as  required  by 
Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  51  (10  CFR  Part  51-TN250),  the  NRC 
regulations  that  implement  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969.  as  amended  (42  USC 
4321  et  seq.  -TN661 ).  The  EIS  includes  an  analysis  of  pertinent  environmental  issues, 
including  endangered  and  threatened  species  and  impacts  to  fish  and  wildlife.  The  U.S.  Army 
Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE)  is  participating  in  the  preparation  of  this  EIS  as  a  cooperating 
agency  and  as  a  member  of  the  review  team,  which  consists  of  the  NRC  staff,  its  contractor 
staff,  and  the  USACE  staff.  The  discussion  that  follows  describes  the  ESP  application  and 
Department  of  the  Army  permit  application  reviews,  the  proposed  actions  by  the  NRC  and 
USACE,  and  the  activities  over  which  the  USACE  has  jurisdiction. 

An  ESP  is  an  NRC  approval  of  a  site  for  one  or  more  nuclear  power  facilities  that  resolves 
safety  and  environmental  issues  related  to  site  suitability.  Issuance  of  an  ESP  is  a  process  that 
is  separate  from  the  issuance  of  a  construction  permit  (CP)  and  operating  license  (OL)  or  a 
combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (COL)  for  such  a  facility,  which  would  be 
needed  to  construct  and  operate  a  nuclear  power  plant  on  a  site  approved  by  an  ESP.  The 
ESP  application  and  review  process  makes  it  possible  to  evaluate  and  resolve  safety  and 
environmental  issues  related  to  siting  before  the  applicant  makes  a  large  commitment  of 
resources.  If  the  ESP  is  approved,  the  applicant  can  "bank  the  site  for  up  to  20  years  for  future 
reactor  siting,  but  may  not  conduct  activities  defined  as  “construction"  in  10  CFR  50.10(a)(1) 
(TN249)  without  applying  for  and  receiving  further  authorization.  To  construct  and  operate  a 
nuclear  power  plant,  an  ESP  holder  must  obtain  a  CP  and  an  OL,  or  a  COL,  which  are  separate 
major  Federal  actions  that  require  their  own  environmental  reviews  in  accordance  with  10  CFR 
Part  51  (TN250).  An  applicant  for  a  CP  or  COL  for  a  new  nuclear  plant  to  be  located  at  a  site 
for  which  an  ESP  has  been  issued  may  reference  the  ESP.  and  matters  resolved  in  the  ESP 
proceeding  are  considered  resolved  in  any  subsequent  proceeding  absent  the  identification  of 
new  and  significant  information.  For  a  COL  application  that  references  an  ESP,  the  NRC  staff, 
pursuant  to  10  CFR  51.75(c)(1)  (TN250),  would  prepare  a  supplement  to  the  ESP  EIS  in 
accordance  with  10  CFR  51.92(e)  (TN250)  and  would  engage  in  new  consultation  in 
accordance  with  Section  305(b)(2)  of  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and 
Management  Act  (MSA.  16  USC  1801  et  seq.  -TNI 061 ),  as  amended  by  the  Sustainable 
Fisheries  Act  of  1996  (16  USC  1801  et  seq.  -TN1060). 

The  proposed  actions  related  to  the  PSEG  ESP  application  are  (1)  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for 
the  PSEG  Site  (10  CFR  Part  52-TN251 )  and  (2)  USACE  permit  action  on  a  Department  of  the 
Army  permit  application  pursuant  to  Section  404  of  the  Federal  Water  Pollution  Control  Act 
(Clean  Water  Act;  33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  and  Section  10  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors 
Appropriation  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660).  The  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
Agency  (EPA)  has  the  authority  to  review  and  veto  USACE  decisions  on  Section  404  permits. 

As  mentioned  previously,  the  USACE  is  participating  as  a  cooperating  agency  with  the  NRC  in 
preparing  the  EIS  and  participates  collaboratively  on  the  review  team.  Upon  issuance  of  the 
draft  EIS  (NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN4279),  PSEG  submitted  a  Section  10/404  permit 
application  to  the  USACE  on  August  8.  2014  (PSEG  2014-TN4235);  the  Department  of  the 
Army  permit  application  number  is  CENAP-OP-R-2009-01 57^15.  The  NRC  and  USACE 


November  2015  F. 3.2-65  NUREG-2168 


F-217 


Appendix  F 


prepared  this  essential  fish  habitat  (EFH)  assessment  to  support  their  joint  consultation  with  the 
National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  in  accordance  with  Section  305(b)(2)  of  the  MSA,  as 
amended  (16  USC  1801  et  seq.  -TN1061).  The  USACE  permit  decision  will  be  made  following 
issuance  of  the  final  EIS  and  would  authorize  preparation  of  a  haul  road  along  the  shoreline, 
building  the  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  (also  referred  to  as  the  barge  unloading 
and  mooring  facility  in  the  USACE  public  notice  [USACE  2014-TN4235]),  building  the  proposed 
5-mi  causeway,  and  installation  of  the  cooling  water  system  intake  and  discharge  structures. 
Therefore,  only  these  activities,  which  are  identified  in  the  Department  of  Army  permit 
application,  are  described  in  this  assessment. 

In  a  final  rule  dated  October  9,  2007  (72  FR  57416-TN260),  the  NRC  limited  the  definition  of 
“construction”  to  the  activities  that  fall  within  its  regulatory  authority,  as  provided  in  10  CFR 
50.10(a)(1)  (TN249)  and  10  CFR  51.4  (TN250).  Many  of  the  site-preparation  activities 
associated  with  building  a  nuclear  power  plant  are  not  part  of  the  NRC  action  to  license  the 
plant.  These  activities,  which  are  not  regulated  by  the  NRC  and  therefore  not  within  the  purview 
of  the  NRC  action,  are  grouped  under  the  term  “preconstruction.”  Preconstruction  activities 
include  clearing  and  grading,  excavating,  erecting  support  buildings  and  transmission  lines,  and 
other  associated  activities.  These  preconstruction  activities  may  take  place  before  the 
application  for  an  ESP,  CP/OL,  or  COL  is  submitted,  during  its  review,  or  after  it  has  been 
granted.  Although  preconstruction  activities  are  outside  the  NRC’s  regulatory  authority,  many  of 
them  are  within  the  regulatory  authority  of  local,  State,  or  other  Federal  agencies,  including  the 
USACE. 

While  an  NRC  ESP  does  not  authorize  site-preparation  activities  denoted  as  “preconstruction” 
under  NRC  regulations,  USACE  permits  would  authorize  some  of  those  site-preparation 
activities.  Because  this  is  a  joint  supplemental  EFH  for  both  the  NRC  and  USACE,  the 
distinction  between  construction  and  preconstruction  is  not  carried  forward  in  this  EFH;  both  are 
jointly  discussed  using  the  term  “site-preparation  activities”  when  discussing  effects  to  species 
that  would  take  place  under  the  proposed  actions. 

Pursuant  to  the  MSA,  the  review  team  requested  via  letter  dated  October  26,  2010,  that  the 
NMFS  provide  information  on  EFH  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  (NRC  2010-TN2203).  In  their 
response  to  the  NRC  dated  December  9,  2010,  NMFS  indicated  that  the  estuarine  portions  of  the 
Delaware  River  and  its  tributaries  contain  designated  EFH  for  a  number  of  species  and  directed 
the  NRC  to  prepare  an  EFH  assessment  as  part  of  the  EFH  consultation  process  (NMFS  2010- 
TN21 7 1 ).  Another  request  was  sent  to  NMFS  dated  July  31 , 201 3,  to  confirm  designated  EFH 
for  the  species  provided  in  the  December  9,  2010,  NMFS  letter,  or  to  provide  an  updated  EFH 
species  list  (NRC  2013-TN2805).  A  slightly  revised  list  of  species  with  designated  EFH  was 
received  from  NMFS  (PNNL  2013-TN2687;  NMFS  2013-TN2804).  NMFS  received  the  draft  EIS 
(NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN4279)  and  EFH  assessment  and  provided  comments  on  November 
12,  2014  (NMFS  2014-TN4203),  and  additional  clarification  on  comments  December  15,  2014 
(NRC  2014-TN4208). 

Accordingly,  this  EFH  assessment  supplement  addresses  only  the  comments  received  on  the 
EFH  assessment  related  to  the  following: 

•  discussion  on  Bluefish  EFH  and  reasons  for  exclusion  from  the  EFH  assessment

2.0  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  PROPOSED  ACTION 

PSEG  is  seeking  an  ESP  from  the  NRC  for  a  site  approval  for  a  potential  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  a  site  (the  PSEG  Site)  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS.  PSEG  is  also 
seeking  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit  from  the  USACE  for  certain  site-preparation  activities 
described  below.  Site-preparation  activities  authorized  by  USACE  and  the  New  Jersey 
Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  (but  not  an  NRC  ESP)  that  could  directly 
affect  onsite  and  offsite  aquatic  ecosystems  include  preparation  of  a  haul  road  bulkhead  along 
the  shoreline,  building  the  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  (also  referred  to  as  the 
barge  unloading  and  mooring  facility  in  the  USACE  public  notice  [USACE  2014-TN4235]), 
building  the  proposed  5-mi  causeway,  installation  of  the  cooling  water  system  intake  and 
discharge  structures,  dredging,  installation  of  piles,  and  transport  of  building  materials  by  barge 
to  the  PSEG  Site.  As  these  actions  require  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit  and  are 
permissible,  but  not  authorized,  under  an  NRC  ESP,  they  are  assessed  in  detail  below. 

2.1  Site  Location  and  Description 

The  PSEG  Site  lies  on  Artificial  Island,  directly  north  of  the  existing  SGS  and  HCGS  located  on 
the  east  bank  of  the  Delaware  River  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New 
Jersey,  at  which  point  the  river  is  approximately  2.5  mi  (4  km)  wide.  Artificial  Island  is  a  human- 
made  island  approximately  1,500  ac  (600  ha)  in  size  that  consists  of  tidal  marsh  and  grassland. 
The  USACE  created  the  island  in  the  20th  century  by  the  deposition  of  hydraulically  dredged 
material  atop  a  natural  sand  bar  that  projected  into  the  river.  The  average  elevation  of  the 
island  is  about  9  feet  (ft,  2.7  meters  [m])  above  mean  sea  level  (MSL)  with  a  maximum  elevation 
of  approximately  18  ft  (5.5  m)  above  MSL  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  site  is  located 
approximately  17  mi  (27  km)  south  of  the  Delaware  Memorial  Bridge;  35  mi  (56  km)  southwest 
of  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania;  and  8  mi  (1 3  km)  southwest  of  the  City  of  Salem,  New  Jersey 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Figure  1  shows  the  location  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  areas  within  a  6- 
mi  (10-km)  radius  and  50-mi  (80-km)  radius  of  the  facility. 

PSEG  owns  734  ac  (297  ha)  at  the  southern  end  of  the  Artificial  Island,  of  which  SGS  occupies 
220  ac  (89  ha)  and  HCGS  occupies  53  ac  (62  ha).  PSEG  is  developing  an  agreement  in 
principle  with  the  USACE  to  acquire  an  additional  85  ac  (34  ha)  of  the  USACE’s  Confined 
Disposal  Facility  (CDF)  land  immediately  north  of  HCGS.  Figure  2  and  Figure  3  provide  a 
context  for  the  site  in  relation  to  nearby  water  bodies  and  a  plan  view  of  the  proposed  site  layout 
for  PSEG,  respectively. 

The  region  within  15  mi  (24  km)  of  the  site  is  primarily  used  for  agriculture.  The  area  also 
includes  numerous  parks,  wildlife  refuges,  and  preserves  (e.g.,  Mad  Horse  Creek  Wildlife 
Management  Area  [WMA]  to  the  east;  Cedar  Swamp  State  WMA  to  the  south  in  Delaware; 
Appoquinimink,  Silver  Run,  and  Augustine  State  WMAs  to  the  west  in  Delaware;  and  Supawna 
Meadows  National  Wildlife  Refuge  to  the  north)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

2.1.1  Delaware  River  Estuary 

The  Delaware  River  and  Delaware  Bay  are  a  part  of  the  larger  Delaware  Estuary  and  River 
Basin  that  extends  from  headwaters  in  New  York  State  to  the  coastal  plains  near  Cape 
Henlopen  in  Delaware  (PDE  2012-TN2191 ).  The  Delaware  Bay  extends  from  the  confluence  of 
the  Delaware  River  with  the  Atlantic  Ocean  from  Delaware  River  Mile  (RM)  0  to  RM  54  (River 
Kilometer  [RKM]  0  to  RKM  87).  The  Delaware  River  Estuary  includes  the  Delaware  Bay  and 
extends  up  the  tidal  Delaware  River,  which  is  characterized  by  brackish  water  between 
Delaware  RM  54  and  RM  80  (RKM  87  and  RKM  129)  and  becomes  freshwater  at  Delaware  RM 
80  (RKM  129)  (BBL  and  Integral  2007-TN2126).  The  PSEG  Site  near  the  mouth  of  Alloway 
Creek  is  at  Delaware  RM  52  (RKM  84)  (DRBC  201 1-TN2412)  and  is  considered  to  be  in  the 
lower  estuary  watershed  unit  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  (PDE  2012-TN2191 ). 

The  boundary  of  salinity  intrusion  in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  also  known  as  the  salt  line, 
fluctuates  with  flow  changes.  The  salt  line  moves  in  response  to  the  tides  and  variations  in 
Delaware  River  Estuary  freshwater  discharge.  During  most  of  the  year,  the  salt  line  is  located 
between  the  Commodore  Barry  Bridge  at  Delaware  RM  82  (RKM  132)  and  Reedy  Island  at 
Delaware  RM  54  (RKM  87)  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  During  the  drought  of  record  in  the  1960s, 
the  salt  line  moved  to  its  most  upstream  historically  observed  location  at  Delaware  RM  102 
(RKM  164)  (DRBC  2008-TN2277).  Salinity  is  an  important  determinant  of  biotic  distribution  in 
estuaries,  and  salinity  near  the  PSEG  Site  varies  with  river  flow.  Between  2003  and  2010, 
surface-water  salinity  measurements  near  the  PSEG  Site  ranged  from  1 .8  to  13.3  parts  per 
thousand  (ppt)  and  surface-water  temperatures  ranged  from  0.4  to  28.6°C  (PSEG  2004- 
TN2565;  PSEG  2005-TN2566;  PSEG  2006-TN2567;  PSEG  2007-TN2568;  PSEG  2008- 
TN2569;  PSEG  2009-TN2513;  PSEG  2010-TN2570;  PSEG  201 1-TN2571 ).  Salinity 
measurements  taken  over  a  greater  number  of  years  between  RM  51  and  RM  49  (RKM  82  and 
RKM  79)  report  a  minimum  salinity  of  0.1  ppt  and  a  maximum  of  17.9  ppt  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  For  the  purposes  of  EFH  habitat  assessment,  the  salinity  range  will  conservatively  be 
estimated  between  0  and  18  ppt. 

At  the  PSEG  Site  on  Artificial  Island,  the  estuary  is  tidal  with  a  net  flow  to  the  south.  The 
USACE  maintains  a  dredged  navigation  channel  near  the  center  of  the  estuary  about  6,600  ft 
(2,000  m)  west  of  the  shoreline  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  navigation  channel  is  about  40  ft  (1 2  m) 
deep  and  1 ,300  ft  (400  m)  wide;  however,  starting  in  2010,  the  USACE  began  implementing  the 
Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  to  deepen  the  existing  navigation  channel 
from  40  to  45  ft  (USACE  201 1-TN2262).  On  the  New  Jersey  side  of  the  channel,  water  depths 
in  the  open  estuary  at  mean  low  water  are  fairly  uniform  at  about  20  ft  (6  m).  Predominant  tides 
in  the  area  are  semi-diurnal,  with  a  period  of  approximately  12  hours  and  a  mean  tidal  range  of 
5.3  ft  (1 .6  m)  at  RM  52  (RKM  84)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2.1.2  Wetlands 

Most  of  the  PSEG  Site  is  surrounded  by  tidal  marsh  dominated  by  near  monocultures  of  the 
invasive  common  reed  ( Phragmites  australis ).  This  is  also  the  case  for  most  of  the  tidal  marsh 
surrounding  Hope  Creek,  Alloway  Creek,  and  associated  smaller  marsh  creeks.  Most  of  the 
coastal  wetlands  occur  within  the  northern  portion  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  connect  to  the 
contiguous  Alloway  Creek  and  Hope  Creek  coastal  wetland  systems  (marshes)  (PSEG  2015-

F. 3. 2-71

TN4280).  The  eastern  portion  of  the  PSEG  Site  contains  primarily  freshwater  wetlands 
dominated  by  monocultures  of  common  reed.  They  are  predominantly  tidal  wetland  systems 
that  are  contiguous  with  coastal  wetlands  mapped  by  the  New  Jersey  Wetlands  Act  of  1970 
(N JSA  1 3:9A  et  seq.  -TN3361 ).  Functionally,  these  wetlands  are  similar  to  the  coastal  wetlands 
and  are  tidally  influenced  systems.  Some  areas  on  Artificial  Island,  such  as  the  CDF  and  the 
PSEG  Site  desilt  basins,  have  been  diked  and  are  no  longer  tidally  influenced  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  These  diked  areas  and  onsite  linear  drainage  features  for  stormwater  conveyance 
are  not  considered  EFH  (PSEG  201 5-TN4234). 

The  proposed  causeway  would  cross  NJDEP’s  Mad  Horse  Creek  WMA,  NJDEP’s  Abbotts 
Meadow  WMA,  and  lands  that  are  part  of  PSEG’s  Alloway  Creek  Watershed  Wetland 
Restoration  (ACW)  Site,  which  is  part  of  PSEG’s  Estuary  Enhancement  Program  (EEP) 

(PSEG  2012-TN2282). 

2.2  Wetlands  Alterations 

A  total  of  131  ac  of  wetlands  would  be  lost  as  a  result  of  site-preparation  activities  on  the  PSEG 
Site  and  vicinity  (onsite  and  offsite).  This  represents  less  than  1  percent  of  the  25,534  ac  of 
wetlands  available  in  the  vicinity.  Most  of  these  wetlands  are  dominated  by  near  monocultures 
of  the  common  reed,  a  nonnative  aggressive  invasive  plant  species  that  significantly  impacts 
wetland  diversity  and  habitat  structure  with  resultant  significant  impacts  to  wildlife  habitat  quality 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

As  described  in  Table  1 ,  building  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  permanently  disturb  108  ac 
of  wetlands  onsite,  including  7 1 .75  ac  within  the  USACE  and  PSEG  confined  disposal  facilities 
areas.  A  total  of  31 .8  ac  of  wetlands  would  be  temporarily  disturbed  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Offsite  impacts  to  wetlands  from  building  activities  in  the  offsite  adjacent  areas  and  the 
proposed  causeway  would  total  72.8  ac,  of  which  49.8  ac  would  be  temporary  impacts.  A 
permanent  loss  of  23  ac  would  occur  in  the  wetlands  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway, 
(Table  2). 

Permanent  impacts  to  wetland  plant  communities  along  the  causeway  would  be  limited  to 
placement  of  piers  and  direct  shading.  Shading  could  potentially  result  in  some  alteration  of 
plant  community  makeup  under  the  causeway  and  a  reduction  in  primary  productivity.  The 
building  method  for  the  proposed  causeway  has  not  yet  been  determined,  but  construction  work 
mats  are  expected  to  be  used  within  an  easement  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Original  estimates  for 
the  causeway  impacts  were  calculated  for  a  50-ft-wide  easement.  However,  PSEG  further 
refined  the  engineering  plan  for  the  causeway  and  reduced  the  proposed  width  to  39  ft  and 
approximately  10  ft  above  the  marsh  plain,  which  should  further  reduce  any  shading  effects 
(PSEG  2014-TN4235).  Reductions  in  primary  productivity  due  to  causeway  development 
should  be  minimal  overall,  considering  the  large  area  of  adjacent  coastal  wetlands  within  the 
project  vicinity.  An  estimated  2,123  linear  ft  of  marsh  creek  channels  would  be  crossed  by  the 
proposed  causeway  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  PSEG  plans  to  avoid  placement  of  support  pilings 
in  stream  channels  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Runoff  from  disturbed  areas  would  be  temporary 
and  controlled  through  the  use  of  BMPs  required  for  water  quality  in  compliance  with  Federal 
and  New  Jersey  permitting,  and  runoff  is  not  expected  to  adversely  affect  Delaware  River 
Estuary  surface  waters  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).

The  biological  communities  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  are 
typical  of  those  that  exist  all  along  the  main  reaches  of  the  Delaware  Bay  system.  To  mitigate 
egg  and  larval  fish  loss  through  the  cooling  system  for  SGS,  PSEG  proposed  and  established 
an  EEP  to  restore  salt  marshes  and  provide  monitoring  and  other  structural  enhancements  to 
mitigate  losses  of  aquatic  species  through  impingement  and  entrainment  at  SGS  (Balletto  and 
Teal  201 1-TN2612).  The  PSEG  EEP  was  established  in  1995  as  part  of  New  Jersey  Pollutant 
Discharge  Elimination  System  (NJPDES)  requirements  for  SGS  and  includes  an  ongoing 
biological  monitoring  program  in  addition  to  habitat  restoration  to  track  the  success  of  the 
mitigation  actions.  Because  of  the  biological  monitoring  surveys  that  have  been  conducted  in 
this  area  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  since  the  mid-1 980s  in  support  of  environmental 
requirements  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  SGS  and  HCGS,  an  extensive  long-term  data 
set  exists  on  the  fishery  and  benthic  macroinvertebrate  communities  of  this  area,  which  includes 
prey  species  for  managed  fishery  species  discussed  further  in  Section  3.2. 

2.3  Dredging  Activities 

Before  initiating  any  site-preparation  or  development  activities,  PSEG  would  be  required  to 
obtain,  from  the  USACE,  the  appropriate  authorizations  regulating  alterations  to  waters  of  the 
United  States,  including  ponds  and  creeks.  Site-preparation  activities  that  could  directly  affect 
onsite  and  offsite  aquatic  ecosystems  include  installing  the  haul  road  bulkhead,  building  the 


NUREG-2168 


F. 3. 2-74

Appendix  F 


barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility,  installing  the  cooling  water  system  intake  and 
discharge  structures,  and  building  the  proposed  causeway  (Figure  2  and  Figure  3).  Aquatic 
habitats  potentially  affected  include  habitats  associated  with  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  and  the 
interconnected  system  of  tidal  wetlands  and  marsh  creeks  primarily  north  of  the  PSEG  Site. 
Potential  direct  impacts  on  aquatic  resources  as  a  result  of  site-preparation  activities  would 
involve  physical  alteration  of  habitat  (e.g.,  infilling,  dredging)  including  temporary  or  permanent 
removal  of  associated  benthic  organisms,  sedimentation,  changes  in  hydrological  regimes,  and 
changes  in  water  quality.  Potential  indirect  impacts  would  include  increased  runoff  from 
impervious  surfaces  and  subsequent  erosion,  as  well  as  sedimentation  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 
Benthic  habitats  in  the  areas  for  proposed  dredging  consist  of  fine-grained  sediments  composed 
of  clay,  silt,  and  sand.  Shoreline  depths  drop  quickly  to  10  to  12  ft  (3.0  to  3.7  m)  and  then 
gradually  increase  in  depth  to  between  15  to  25  ft  (4.6  to  7.6  m)  nearshore  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  depth  of  the  areas  identified  for  dredging  is  a  minimum  of  1 0  ft  (3.0  m)  relative  to 
mean  low  water  with  the  exception  of  the  western  boundary  of  Artificial  Island,  which  is 
shallower  than  10  ft  (3.0  m)  and  consists  of  artificially  placed  rock.  Mitigation  is  not  warranted 
as  there  is  no  shallow  water  habitat  conversion  to  deep  water  habitat  (PSEG  201 5-TN4234), 
and  compensatory  mitigation  is  generally  not  required  where  a  habitat  change  does  not  occur. 
The  nearshore  benthic  macroinvertebrate  community  and  fish  diversity  is  described  in  Section 
2.4.2. 1  of  the  EIS. 

Shoreline  installation  and  site-preparation  activities  would  require  a  stormwater  pollution 
prevention  plan,  developed  as  part  of  the  NJPDES  stormwater  permit,  which  would  describe 
best  management  practices  (BMPs)  to  control  sedimentation  and  erosion  and  provide 
stormwater  management.  Shoreline  structures  would  be  hardened  to  protect  from  shoreline 
erosion  using  placement  of  concrete  or  riprap  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Approximately  1  ac  of 
open  water  would  be  filled  (average  width  of  fill  would  be  1 0  ft)  due  to  placement  of  the 
bulkhead  cap  and  sheeting  along  the  bulkhead  shoreline  (PSEG  2014-TN4235). 

The  new  barge  storage  area  and  unloading  facility  would  require  dredging  about  440,000  yd3  of 
sediment  to  lower  the  river  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  61  ac  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  An  additional 
0.05  ac  of  river  bottom  habitat  would  be  removed  for  installation  of  seven  20-ft-diameter  barge 
mooring  caissons.  Installation  of  a  new  intake  structure  would  require  dredging  of  about 
225,000  yd3  of  sediment  to  lower  the  river  bottom  by  4.5  ft  over  31  ac  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Dredging,  grading,  and  backfilling  activities  would  be  required  for  installation  of  a  new  discharge 
structure;  approximately  0.2  ac  of  tidal  waters  would  be  affected  (PSEG  2014-TN4235).  As 
dredging  will  be  done  by  one  hydraulic  suction  dredge,  dredged  material  disposal  would  be  by 
direct  pipeline  to  Artificial  Island  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  No  maintenance  dredging  is  planned 
under  the  Department  of  Army  permit  application.  In  total,  approximately  92  ac  of  open  water 
habitat  would  be  permanently  affected  by  dredging,  which  will  occur  over  a  2-month  period 
(USACE  2015-TN4277). 

The  installation  of  the  barge  storage  and  unloading  facilities  as  well  as  the  intake  and  discharge 
structures  would  result  in  temporary  disturbances  to  the  aquatic  habitat  in  those  portions  of  the 
Delaware  River  Estuary.  An  increase  in  suspended  sediments  could  occur  during  dredging 
activities;  however,  PSEG  determined  that  due  to  the  natural  high  turbidity  of  the  Delaware 
Estuary  at  the  project  location,  any  increase  in  sedimentation  would  not  be  noticeable  (PSEG 


November  2015 


F. 3.2-75 


NUREG-2168 


F-227 


Appendix  F 


2015-TN4234).  PSEG  would  comply  with  NJDEP  and  USACE  permitting  regulations  regarding 
timing  and  duration  of  dredging  to  avoid  sensitive  aquatic  life  stage  development  or  spawning 
(e.g.,  the  current  USACE  work  window  to  avoid  dredge  activities  occurs  between  March  1  and 
June  30).  The  review  team  reviewed  a  recent  report  on  sediment  analysis  for  the  Delaware 
River  Basin  that  describes  sediment  samples  near  the  PSEG  Site  as  potentially  suitable  for 
aquatic  habitat  restoration  projects  (DERSMPW  2013-TN4204).  Therefore,  dredging  in  this 
area  near  the  PSEG  Site  is  unlikely  to  introduce  adverse  exposure  from  sediment  contaminants 
to  nearby  aquatic  biota.  PSEG  proposes  to  use  a  hydraulic  suction  dredge  to  further  minimize 
increases  in  turbidity  and  sedimentation,  to  limit  the  duration  of  dredging,  and  to  avoid  the  need 
to  handle  dredged  material  twice  (PSEG  2015-TN4234).  PSEG  also  would  use  appropriate 
BMPs  to  minimize  sedimentation  effects  as  required  for  Federal  and  State  permitting.  Motile 
invertebrates,  fish,  and  sea  turtles  might  swim  into  this  portion  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary, 
but  they  would  be  able  to  swim  away  or  likely  would  avoid  the  area  due  to  dredging  activity  and 
noise  from  pile  driving  that  may  occur  simultaneously. 

Mobile  macroinvertebrates  in  this  area  might  be  able  to  occupy  adjacent  habitat  in  the  Delaware 
River  Estuary  as  the  species  composition  and  abundance  of  the  macroinvertebrate  community 
in  the  Delaware  River  Estuary  near  the  site  are  similar  to  those  of  benthic  communities  in 
adjacent  benthic  areas  of  the  estuary.  Although  permanent  alteration  of  at  least  92  ac  of  river 
bottom  habitat  would  occur,  the  impacts  to  aquatic  communities  in  the  vicinity  are  expected  to 
be  minimal  as  benthic  organisms  would  begin  to  re-colonize  the  area  following  the  completion  of 
dredging  activities  (Wilber  and  Clarke  2007-TN4271 ). 

2.4  Barge  Traffic 

Vessel  use  during  dredging  or  installation  of  the  in-water  structures  and  transportation  of 
building  materials  and  large  system  components  to  the  PSEG  Site  may  affect  the  aquatic 
resources  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary,  particularly  the  benthos  or  benthic  dwelling  organisms 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  main  impacts  of  using  vessels  would  include  turbulence  from 
propellers  (prop  wash),  collisions  with  aquatic  species,  and  accidental  spills  of  materials 
overboard.  PSEG  estimated  the  annual  number  of  vessel  trips  for  the  installation  activities 
correlated  to  the  activities  described  for  the  Department  of  Army  permit  to  be  between  247  and 
357.  This  is  an  incremental  increase  to  the  reported  annual  average  of  4,485  commercial 
vessel  trips  in  the  Delaware  River  and  Estuary  between  2007  and  2014  (PSEG  201 5-TN4234). 
PSEG  estimated  that  general  construction  materials  shipped  by  barge  over  a  3-  to  7-year 
period,  would  originate  at  the  Ports  of  Camden,  Philadelphia,  and  Salem,  and  use  shipping 
routes  in  the  Delaware  Bay  and  River  (USACE  201 5-TN4281 ). 

The  NRC  review  team  determined  that  vessel  traffic  during  site-preparation  activities  would 
result  in  minimal  disturbance  to  benthic  habitats  associated  with  the  PSEG  Site  as  it  would 
occur  in  deeper  waters  associated  with  the  installation  of  piles  or  dredging  activities  and  should 
not  affect  the  general  resources  in  the  region  along  this  coast  of  the  Delaware  River  Estuary. 

2.5  Pile  Installation  Activities 

PSEG  estimated  acoustical  effects  from  representative  pile-driving  studies  to  determine  pile 
installation  effects  on  aquatic  biota.  In-water  activities  included  day-time  installation  of  24-in. -

wide  steel  sheeting  in  the  Delaware  Estuary  for  the  intake  structure  (650  sheet  piles),  the  haul 
road  bulkhead  (2,400  sheet  piles)  and  the  barge  unloading  facility  20-ft-diameter  caissons 
(1 ,200  sheet  piles)  with  a  vibratory  hammer  (Table  3).  Causeway  installation  would  also  occur 
during  the  daytime,  and  analysis  was  conducted  for  approximately  1000  30-in. -square  concrete 
piles  using  an  impact  hammer  with  additional  cushioning  to  reduce  pile  head  damage  (PSEG 
2015-TN4234).  PSEG  used  the  NMFS  Pile  Driving  Calculations  spreadsheet  model  (Caltrans 
2013-TN4236)  to  calculate  isopleths  for  the  peak  sound  pressure  level  (SPLpeak),  cumulative 
sound  exposure  level  (SELCUm),  and  behavioral  root  mean  square  sound  pressure  level  (SPLrms) 
using  specific  information  on  piles  such  as  installation  method,  number  of  piles,  and  type  of  pile. 
For  SPLpeak  and  SPLrms  noise  isopleth  estimates,  the  NMFS  model  can  apply  a  default 
transmission  loss  of  15  m  as  a  conservative  assumption  under  a  practical  spreading  loss  model 
that  considers  the  noise  attenuation  (transmission  loss)  when  site-specific  attenuation  is  not 
known  (PSEG  201 5-TN4234).  The  modeled  isopleths  for  SELCUm  account  for  the  number  of  pile¬ 
driving  strikes  per  day,  and  the  number  of  piles  per  day  is  provided  in  Table  3.

The  criteria  for  fish  are  as  follows:  206  dB  re:  IpPa  SPLpeak,  187  dB  re:  1pPa2-s  SELCUm for  fish 
>  2  cm,  1 83  dB  re:  1  pPa2-s  SELCUm  for  fish  <  2  cm,  and  1 50  dB  re:  1  pPa  SPLrms.  The 
determination  for  potential  onset  of  physical  injury  is  determined  by  exceedance  of  both  the 
peak  pressure  (SPLpeak)  and  cumulative  sound  exposure  level  (SELCUm).  A  determination  for 
potential  behavioral  effects  is  made  using  exceedance  of  the  root  mean  square  pressure  level 
(SPLrms)  (Caltrans  2013-TN4236).  Distances  from  the  pile-driving  activity  that  exceed  these 
criteria  are  presented  in  Table  4.

Based  on  the  NMFS  model,  the  206  dB  SPLpeak  is  only  exceeded  immediately  adjacent  to  pile¬ 
driving  activity  and  does  not  extend  1  m  out  except  for  causeway  installation.  The  187/183  dB 
SELcum  exceedance  distance  for  the  proposed  causeway  is  216/398  m  (709/1,306  ft);  however, 
this  distance  extends  over  mostly  vegetated  marsh  plain  and  shallow  marsh  creeks,  not  open 
water  (Figure  5).

3.0  CONSIDERATION  OF  EFH  NEAR  THE  SITE 

3.1  EFH  Species  Identified  for  Preliminary  Analysis 

The  1996  amendments  to  the  MSA  (16  USC  1801  et  seq.  -TN1061)  identified  the 
importance  of  habitat  protection  to  healthy  fisheries.  The  amendments,  known  as  the 
Sustainable  Fisheries  Act  of  1996  (16  USC  1801  et  seq.  -TNI 060),  strengthened  the 
authority  of  governing  agencies  to  protect  and  conserve  the  habitat  of  marine,  estuarine, 
and  anadromous  animals.  EFH  is  defined  as  the  waters  and  substrate  necessary  for 
spawning,  breeding,  feeding,  or  growth  to  maturity  for  managed  fishery  species. 
Identifying  EFH  is  an  essential  component  in  the  development  of  fishery  management 
plans  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  habitat  loss  or  degradation  on  fishery  stocks  and  to  take 
actions  to  mitigate  such  damage.  NMFS  considers  the  estuarine  portion  of  the  Delaware 
River  and  tidal  waters  near  the  PSEG  Site  to  be  EFH  for  1 5  species  (PNNL  2013- 
TN2687;  NMFS  2013-TN2804),  which  are  listed  in  Table  5.

PSEG  Site  with  EFH  requirements  for  each  of  the  species  and  life  stages  that  appear  in 
Table  5  to  further  refine  the  EFH  species  with  the  potential  to  be  adversely  affected  by 
the  proposed  action.  The  EFH  requirements  of  several  of  the  fish  species  and  life

3.2  EFH  Species  Identified  for  Specific  Analysis 

For  those  species  whose  EFH  requirements  do  not  match  the  local  conditions  as 
described  in  Table  6,  the  review  team  did  not  consider  these  species  or  life  stages 
further  in  this  EFH  assessment.  The  Atlantic  Butterfish  was  excluded  based  on  depth 
requirements  not  being  met  for  habitat  near  the  PSEG  Site.  Atlantic  Sea  Herring 
juveniles  and  adults  were  excluded  based  on  salinity  and  depth  requirements  not  being 
met  for  habitat  near  the  PSEG  Site.  Bluefish  juveniles  and  adults,  Cobia,  King  Mackerel, 
Red  Hake,  and  Spanish  Mackerel  were  all  excluded  as  their  salinity  requirements 
exceed  the  available  salinity  range  near  the  PSEG  Site.  The  remaining  species  and  life 
stages  with  EFH  requirements  matching  local  conditions  appear  in  Table  7.

3.3  Prey  for  EFH  Species 

As  described  in  the  draft  EIS  (NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN4279),  a  diversity  of  aquatic 
species  exist  in  the  nearshore  waters  and  coastal  wetlands  near  the  PSEG  Site,  with 
many  of  these  species  representative  of  prey  species  for  other  aquatic  organisms. 
Juvenile  and  adult  Black  Sea  Bass  ( Centropristis  striata )  and  adult  Scup  ( Stenotomus 
chrysops )  prey  on  benthic  invertebrates  such  as  crustaceans  and  squid  (MDMF  2006- 
TN2159;  MDMF  2006-TN2161),  whereas  Clearnose  ( Raja  eglanteria ),  Little  ( Leucoraja 
erinacea ),  and  Winter  (L.  ocellata )  skates  prey  on  polychaete  worms,  small  crustaceans, 
squid,  and  amphipods  (Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2822;  Packer  et  al.  2003-TN2823;  Packer 
et  al.  2003-TN2824). 

Adult  Summer  Flounder  ( Paralichtys  dentatus)  feed  on  smaller  fish,  squids,  crustaceans, 
mollusks,  marine  worms,  and  sand  dollars  (Grimes  et  al.  1989-TN2150),  and  adult 
Winter  Flounder  ( Pseudopieuronectes  americanus)  prefer  similar  prey  items  such  as 
small  crustaceans,  annelid  worms,  small  mollusks,  and  fish  (Hendrickson  2006- 
TN2154).  Juvenile  and  adult  Windowpane  Flounder  ( Scophthalmus  aquosus)  have 
similar  food  sources,  including  small  crustaceans  and  fish  larvae  of  hakes  and  Tomcod 
( Microgadus  tomcod)  (Chang  et  al.  1999-TN2133).

4.0  POTENTIAL  ADVERSE  EFFECTS  TO  EFH 

The  provisions  of  the  MSA  define  an  “adverse  effect”  to  EFH  as  the  following  (50  CFR 
Part  600-TN 1342): 


Adverse  effect  means  any  impact  that  reduces  quality  and/or  quantity 
of  EFH.  Adverse  effects  may  include  direct  or  indirect  physical, 
chemical,  or  biological  alterations  of  the  waters  or  substrate  and  loss 
of,  or  injury  to,  benthic  organisms,  prey  species  and  their  habitat,  and 
other  ecosystem  components,  if  such  modifications  reduce  the  quality 
and/or  quantity  of  EFH.  Adverse  effects  to  EFH  may  result  from 
actions  occurring  within  EFH  or  outside  of  EFH  and  may  include 
site-specific  or  habitat-wide  impacts,  including  individual,  cumulative,  or 
synergistic  consequences  of  actions. 


The  review  team  has  identified  the  following  potential  PSEG  site-preparation  activities 
that  may  cause  adverse  effects  to  EFH: 

•  wetlands  Impacts 

•  dredging  activities 

•  pile  installation  activities. 

In  the  following  section,  each  of  these  issues  is  addressed  for  the  EFH  species  and  their 
prey  identified  for  in-depth  analysis  in  Table  7. 

4.1  Wetlands  Effects 

The  NMFS  has  designated  EFH  for  the  species  identified  in  Table  7  within  the  vicinity  of 
the  PSEG  Site  due  to  the  depth,  temperature,  and  salinity  characteristics  present  to 
support  specific  life  stages.  Managed  species  with  EFH  that  may  be  affected  by  impacts 
to  wetlands  include  Black  Sea  Bass  juveniles,  Scup  juveniles  and  adults,  Summer 
Flounder  juveniles  and  adults,  Windowpane  juveniles  and  adults,  and  Winter  Flounder 
juveniles,  and  adults.  In  addition,  these  managed  species  all  rely  on  prey  species  that 
use  wetland  habitats  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Wetland  habitats  are  not 
considered  EFH  for  skates  such  as  the  Little  Skate  or  Winter  Skate  which  have  not  been 
collected  or  reported  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  these  skate  species 
prey  on  small  crustaceans,  and  the  Clearnose  Skate,  which  may  occur  near  the  PSEG 
Site,  preys  on  small  fishes  that  are  abundant  in  wetland  habitats. 

Site-preparation  activities  within  the  diked  CDFs  would  encompass  71.75  ac  (66%)  of 
the  total  affected  wetland  habitats  identified  as  being  permanently  affected  on  the  PSEG 
Site.  These  wetland  habitats,  not  connected  to  the  coastal,  tidally  influenced 
surrounding  wetland  habitats,  are  dominated  by  the  invasive  common  reed  (i.e. , 
Phragmites),  and  have  been  routinely  disturbed  by  authorized  dredged  material  disposal 
activities.  The  remaining  36.25  ac  of  permanent  wetland  habitat  loss  are  a  mix  of 
different  wetland  types,  with  the  majority  also  being  Phragmites-6 o m i n ated  wetland  as 
described  in  Section  2.2. 


NUREG-2168 


F. 3. 2-82 


November  2015 


F-234 


Appendix  F 


Permanent  loss  of  23  ac  of  wetlands  along  the  elevated  causeway  would  be  limited  to 
areas  of  pier  placement.  PSEG  proposes  to  build  the  elevated  causeway  from  the 
northeast  corner  of  the  PSEG  property  along  or  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek-Red 
Lion  transmission  corridor  to  minimize  land  impacts.  Shading  could  potentially  result  in 
some  alteration  of  plant  community  makeup  under  the  causeway  and  a  reduction  in 
primary  productivity.  PSEG  proposes  to  use  construction  work  mats  within  a  50-ft-wide 
easement,  although  final  installation  plans  would  likely  identify  a  smaller  installation  area 
footprint  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Loss  of  wetland  habitat  and  reductions  in  primary 
productivity  due  to  causeway  development  should  be  minimal  overall,  considering  the 
large  area  of  adjacent  coastal  wetlands  within  the  project  vicinity. 

Although  the  affected  wetlands  are  a  minimal  portion  of  the  overall  abundance  of 
wetland  land-cover  types  within  the  vicinity  (25,534  ac),  the  potential  impacts  to  wetland 
habitats  are  expected  to  be  noticeable  and  will  warrant  some  form  of  compensatory 
mitigation.  The  quality  of  the  impacted  resource  reflects  a  dominance  of  the  invasive 
common  reed,  and  a  large  amount  of  onsite  wetland  acreage  is  within  the  diked  CDFs, 
which  are  not  connected  to  nearshore  EFH.  The  wetlands  are  regulated  under  the 
authority  and  jurisdiction  of  the  USACE  and  the  NJDEP. 

The  USACE  approach  is  that  mitigation  may  only  be  used  after  all  appropriate  and 
practical  steps  to  avoid  and  minimize  adverse  impacts  to  aquatic  resources,  including 
nontidal  wetlands  and  streams,  have  been  taken.  Further,  the  USACE  requires  all 
remaining  unavoidable  impacts  to  be  compensated  to  the  extent  appropriate  and 
practicable.  The  USACE  could  monitor  or  require  monitoring  for  compliance  with  the 
USACE-issued  permits.  The  Department  of  the  Army  permit  could  include  special 
conditions  that  could  require  PSEG  to  ensure  that  the  created  and  enhanced  wetlands 
meet  the  Federal  wetland  criteria  outlined  in  the  report  entitled  Corps  of  Engineers 
Wetlands  Delineation  Manual  (USACE  1987-TN2066).  If  the  USACE  did  not  find  the 
wetlands  and  stream  mitigation  satisfactory,  it  could  determine  whether  adverse  impacts 
to  the  waterway  and  wetlands  were  more  than  minimal  and  any  project  modifications 
could  be  warranted.  In  addition,  the  USACE  would  require  PSEG  to  assume  all  liability 
for  accomplishing  the  corrective  work  in  accordance  with  73  FR  19594,  “Compensatory 
Mitigation  for  Losses  of  Aquatic  Resources”  (73  FR  19594-TN1789;  33  CFR  Part  320- 
TN424;  33  CFR  Part  325-TN425). 

PSEG  has  taken  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  impacts  to  jurisdictional  wetlands  to  the 
maximum  extent  possible.  Mitigation  measures  to  minimize  adverse  impacts  to  waters 
of  the  United  States  include  the  following:  minimizing  encroachment  into  coastal 
wetlands;  minimizing  encroachment  into  NJDEP-regulated  freshwater  wetlands;  use  of 
already  existing  sediment-disposal  basins  for  plant  development  (i.e.,  the  PSEG 
permitted  disposal  facility  and  the  USACE  CDF);  refinement  of  the  PSEG  Site  Utilization 
Plan  (Figure  3)  to  avoid  various  wetland  areas  throughout  the  PSEG  Site;  and  a 
causeway  built  on  elevated  piers  or  bridges,  instead  of  on  fill,  to  minimize  direct  impacts 
to  tidal  wetlands  and  to  avoid  impacts  to  tidal  creeks  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  PSEG 
plans  to  develop  additional  wetland  impact  minimization  measures  after  a  reactor 
technology  has  been  selected  and  final  site  layout  design  is  developed  (PSEG  2014- 
TN4235).

NUREG-2168

Appendix  F 


Following  the  implementation  of  reasonable  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  impacts  to 
wetlands,  compensation  for  unavoidable  adverse  impacts  could  be  undertaken  with  the 
execution  of  an  approved  wetland  restoration  and/or  rehabilitation  program.  In  selecting 
a  site  for  wetland  mitigation,  the  following  factors  are  typically  considered:  existing  land 
use  (historic  and  current),  property  ownership  or  potential  for  acquisition,  hydrologic 
potential,  proximity  to  other  wetland  sites,  site  topography,  connectivity  to  adjacent 
natural  habitats,  site  accessibility,  and  the  presence  of  or  potential  to  develop  hydric 
soils  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Opportunities  for  wetland  mitigation  exist  at  various 
locations  throughout  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity.  Factors  that  may  influence  site 
selection  for  wetland  creation  include  topography,  soil  types,  watershed  size,  and  the 
presence  of  adjacent  streams  as  a  source  of  additional  water  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 
Once  a  candidate  mitigation  site  has  been  selected,  wetland  mitigation  could  be 
achieved  through  a  series  of  rehabilitation  and/or  restoration  methods.  These  methods 
could  be  site-specific  and  might  include  the  control  of  common  reed,  restoration  of  the 
hydrologic  state  (i.e.,  levee  removal,  channel  design,  and  reestablishing  a  connection  of 
upland  areas  to  tidal  influences),  and  wetland  enhancement  that  included  the  restoration 
of  desirable  and  native  vegetation  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Wetland  mitigation  plan  details  would  primarily  be  guided  by  conditions  established 
under  Clean  Water  Act  (33  USC  1251  et  seq.  -TN662)  Section  404  permits  issued  by 
the  USACE  or  the  NJDEP  Land  Use  Regulation  Program  and  Section  401  water-quality 
certifications  issued  by  NJDEP.  Therefore,  specific  wetland  mitigation  efforts  could  be 
determined  as  part  of  such  authorizations  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Several  candidate 
mitigation  areas  that  have  the  potential  to  meet  some  or  all  of  PSEG  wetland  mitigation 
needs  were  identified  during  the  ESP  application  process.  These  candidate  mitigation 
areas  include  portions  of  the  existing  PSEG  Site,  Mannington  Meadow,  Mason’s  Point, 
and  additional  areas  of  the  PSEG  ACW  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Wetland  mitigation  concepts  for  each  area  include  the  enhancement  and/or  development 
of  coastal  and  freshwater  wetland  systems.  A  network  of  marsh  creeks  is  integral  to  the 
restoration  of  coastal  marsh  and  would  address  the  loss  of  creeks  within  the  existing 
marsh.  While  the  loss  of  wetlands  for  site  preparation  and  causeway  installation  may  be 
noticeable,  the  review  team  determined  that  the  habitat  loss  would  not  destabilize 
wetland  resources  in  the  vicinity  or  the  ecological  function  of  nearby,  unaffected  habitat 
to  support  prey  species  important  to  sustain  populations  of  managed  species. 

Therefore,  effects  to  EFH  for  managed  species  and  their  prey  from  wetland  habitat  loss 
would  be  minor. 

4.2  Dredging  Effects 

Managed  species  with  EFH  that  may  be  affected  by  dredging  impacts  include  all  species 
and  life  stages  listed  in  Table  7.  In  addition,  juvenile  and  adult  managed  species  rely  on 
prey  species  found  in  the  vicinity  of  the  dredge  areas.  PSEG  proposes  to  use  one 
hydraulic  dredge  over  a  2-month  period,  which  would  serve  to  reduce  turbidity  and 
sedimentation  associated  with  dredging  and  would  limit  the  extent  of  impacts  on  aquatic 
resources  by  minimizing  the  duration  of  in-water  activity  (PSEG  2015-TN4234). 

Although  use  of  an  environmental  hopper  dredge  may  be  less  likely  to  be  directly 


NUREG-21 68 


F. 3. 2-84 


November  2015 


F-236 


Appendix  F 


injurious  to  fish  species,  this  method  requires  a  longer  work  window,  increases  turbidity, 
and  requires  additional  handling  of  material  for  disposal. 

Since  hydraulic  dredging  could  potentially  entrain  or  impinge  juvenile  fish,  fish  larvae, 
and  eggs,  PSEG  would  adhere  to  the  seasonal  in-water  timing  restrictions  imposed  by 
the  USACE  (currently  March  1  through  June  30)  and  NJDEP  for  dredging  and  other  in¬ 
water  work  to  avoid  sensitive  spawning  or  recruitment  windows  to  minimize  these  effects 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4234).  Some  dredging  would  likely  coincide  with  pile-driving  activities 
previously  described,  and  thus  discourage  fish  species  from  foraging  in  the  immediate 
area.  Disruption  of  habitat  for  foraging  in  these  areas  of  the  Delaware  River  or  wetland 
areas  associated  with  the  causeway  is  expected  to  be  minor,  temporary,  and  largely 
mitigable  with  the  use  of  BMPs,  hydraulic  dredge  technology,  and  compliance  with 
USACE  and  NJDEP  work  window  requirements.  Juvenile  and  adult  managed  species 
and  their  prey  species  that  may  be  present  should  be  able  to  use  adjacent  unaffected 
habitats  during  dredge  activities.  Therefore,  effects  to  EFH  for  managed  species  and 
their  prey  from  dredging  operations  would  be  minor. 

4.3  Pile  Installation  Effects 

Managed  species  with  EFH  that  may  be  affected  by  noise  from  installation  of  piles 
include  all  juvenile  and  adult  species  listed  in  Table  7.  In  addition,  juvenile  and  adult 
managed  species  rely  on  fish  prey  species  that  may  also  be  affected  by  pile  installation 
noise.  PSEG  provided  an  analysis  using  criteria  accepted  by  NMFS  for  estimating 
exceedance  distances  to  determine  cumulative  sound  exposure  effect  and  behavioral 
adverse  effects  from  pile-driving  activities.  Figure  5  shows  the  areas  for  noise  effects 
which  will  occur  over  a  period  of  approximately  50  days  for  causeway  piling  installation, 
10  days  for  intake  structure  sheet  piles,  and  20  days  each  for  shoreline  and  caisson 
sheet  pile  installation  (PSEG  201 5-TN4234).  Given  the  short  duration  of  activity,  and  the 
abundance  of  nearby,  adjacent  unaffected  habitat,  it  is  likely  that  managed  species  and 
their  mobile  prey  would  avoid  the  zone  of  adverse  behavioral  affect.  Therefore,  effects 
to  EFH  for  managed  species  and  their  prey  from  pile-driving  activities  would  be  minor. 

5.0  CONCLUSIONS 

Conclusions  regarding  PSEG  adverse  effects  on  EFH  are  addressed  in  Table  8.  All 
conclusions  are  made  for  the  PSEG  site-preparation  activities  as  defined  in  the 
Department  of  Army  permit  application  (PSEG  2014-4235).

F.3.3  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  Biological  Assessment 

Two  versions  of  the  FWS  BA  are  on  display  in  this  section.  The  first  version  (dated  June  2014) 
is  the  BA  originally  sent  by  the  NRC  to  the  FWS  for  review.  This  is  the  same  version  of  the  BA 
that  was  on  display  in  Section  F.3.3  of  the  draft  EIS. 

Subsequent  to  the  issuance  of  the  draft  EIS  and  based  on  NRC  review  of  sources  from  FWS 
and  the  states  of  Delaware  and  New  Jersey,  one  Federally  threatened  bat  species  and  one 
Federally  threatened  bird  species  were  identified  with  the  potential  to  be  present  in  the  site 
vicinity  that  were  not  discussed  in  the  June  2014  version  of  the  BA.  These  species  are  northern 
long-eared  bat  ( Myotis  septentrionalis)  and  rufa  red  knot  ( Calidris  canutus  rufa). 

The  second  version  of  the  FWS  BA  (dated  August  2015)  on  display  in  this  section  is  a 
supplement  to  the  original  BA.  This  supplemental  BA  focuses  on  evaluating  the  potential  effects 
from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  the  northern  long-eared 
bat  and  the  rufa  red  knot.

BIOLOGICAL  ASSESSMENT  OF  THE  POTENTIAL  EFFECTS  ON 
FEDERALLY  LISTED/PROPOSED  LISTED  ENDANGERED  OR 

THREATENED  SPECIES 

FROM  THE  PROPOSED  EARLY  SITE  PERMIT  FOR  THE  PSEG  SITE 
1.0  INTRODUCTION 

The  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  review  team  is  reviewing  an  application 
submitted  by  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  for  an  early  site  permit 
(ESP)  for  a  site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and 
Salem  Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2  (SGS),  on  the  eastern  shore  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  As  part  of  its  review  of 
this  ESP  application,  the  NRC  is  preparing  an  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  as  required 
by  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (10  CFR)  Part  51 ,  the  NRC  regulations  that 
implement  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969,  as  amended  (NEPA)  (42  USC  4321- 
TN661).  The  EIS  will  include  an  analysis  of  pertinent  environmental  issues,  including 
endangered  and  threatened  species  and  impacts  to  fish  and  wildlife.  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of 
Engineers  (USACE),  Philadelphia  District,  is  a  cooperating  agency  on  the  EIS. 

An  ESP  is  a  commission  approval  of  a  site  or  sites  for  one  or  more  nuclear  power  facilities. 
Issuance  of  an  ESP  is  a  process  that  is  separate  from  the  issuance  of  a  construction  permit 
(CP),  an  operating  license  (OL),  or  a  combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (COL) 
for  such  a  facility.  The  ESP  application  and  review  process  makes  it  possible  to  evaluate  and 
resolve  safety  and  environmental  issues  related  to  siting  before  the  applicant  makes  a  large 
commitment  of  resources.  If  the  ESP  is  approved,  the  applicant  can  “bank”  the  site  for  up  to 
20  years  for  future  reactor  siting  and  can  conduct  certain  site  preparation  activities  enumerated 
in  10  CFR  50.10(a)(2)  (10  CFR  50-TN249).  An  ESP  does  not,  however,  authorize  construction 
and  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant.  To  construct  and  operate  a  nuclear  power  plant,  an 
ESP  holder  must  obtain  a  CP  and  an  OL,  or  a  COL,  which  are  separate  major  Federal  actions 
that  require  their  own  environmental  reviews  in  accordance  with  10  CFR  Part  51  (10  CFR  51- 
TN250). 

By  letter  dated  October  26,  2010  (NRC  2010-TN2202),  the  NRC  initiated  Endangered  Species 
Act  of  1973  (ESA)  (16  USC  1531-TN1010)  Section  7  consultation  with  the  U.  S.  Fish  and 
Wildlife  Service  (FWS)  and  requested  a  list  of  endangered,  threatened,  candidate,  and 
proposed  species  as  well  as  designated  and  proposed  critical  habitat  that  may  be  in  the  vicinity 
of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  NRC  received  an  e-mail  response  (dated  March  20,  2013)  from  Steve 
Mars,  senior  biologist  at  the  FWS  New  Jersey  Field  office,  which  stated,  “The  activities  you 
[NRC]  describe  will  not  likely  affect  a  federal  listed  species  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  USFWS” 
(FWS  2013-TN3364).  In  a  letter  to  FWS  dated  December  13,  2013,  the  NRC  requested  an 
update  on  Federally  listed,  proposed,  and  candidate  species  as  well  as  designated  and 
proposed  critical  habitat  that  may  be  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  any  updates  to  the 
initial  information  to  assist  with  the  preparation  of  the  ESA  biological  assessment  (BA)  and  EIS 
for  the  project  (NRC  201 3-TN3363).  NRC  had  not  yet  received  a  response  as  of  the  date  of  the 
preparation  of  this  BA.

Appendix  F 


Based  on  NRC  review  of  electronic  sources  from  the  states  of  Delaware,  and  New  Jersey,  one 
Federally  listed  turtle  species  was  identified  that  has  the  potential  to  be  present  in  the  site 
vicinity.  Additionally,  the  northern  long-eared  bat  has  been  proposed  for  listing  as  an 
endangered  species.  The  sensitive  joint  vetch,  swamp  pink,  and  small  whorled  pogonia  species 
have  been  documented  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  the  occurrence  of  these 
species  and  suitable  habitat  to  support  them  has  not  been  documented  or  is  not  known  to  occur 
on  the  PSEG  Site  or  along  areas  that  would  be  disturbed  by  building  support  facilities  or  a 
proposed  causeway.  Accordingly,  this  BA  focuses  on  evaluating  the  potential  effects  from 
building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  adjacent  to  SGS  and 
HCGS,  on  the  Federally  listed  turtle  species  and  Federally  proposed  endangered  bat  species. 

2.0  DESCRIPTION  OF  PROPOSED  ACTION 

PSEG  is  seeking  an  ESP  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  a  site  (the  PSEG  Site)  located 
adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS.  Building  activities  that  could  affect  onsite  and  offsite 
terrestrial  and  wetland  ecosystems  include  site  preparation  for  installation  of  the  power  block, 
cooling  tower,  concrete  batch  plant,  intake  structure,  switchyard,  offices  and  warehouses,  heavy 
haul  road,  temporary  laydown  areas,  parking  areas,  and  a  proposed  causeway  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452). 

2.1  Location  and  Description 

2.1.1  Site 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Artificial  Island  was  formed  from  dredge  spoils 
produced  as  a  result  of  maintenance  dredging  of  the  Delaware  River  navigation  channel  by  the 
USACE.  The  site  is  approximately  7  mi  east  of  Middletown,  Delaware;  7.5  mi  southwest  of 
Salem,  New  Jersey;  and  9  mi  south  of  Pennsville,  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Figure  1 
shows  the  location  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  areas  within  a  6-mi  (10-km)  radius  and  a  50-mi 
(80-km)  radius  of  the  facility. 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  HCGS  and  SGS  on  the  northwestern  portion  of  the 
existing  PSEG  property.  Figure  2  depicts  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  in  relation  to  the  existing 
units  and  nearby  water  bodies.  PSEG  owns  734  ac  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  is  developing  an 
agreement  with  the  USACE  to  acquire  85  ac  immediately  north  of  the  site.  Thus,  the  total 
proposed  PSEG  Site  would  encompass  819  ac  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Figure  3  provides  an 
aerial  view  of  the  proposed  site  layout  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  area  within  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  site  contains  mainly  water  (Delaware  River  and  Bay), 
agricultural  lands,  wetlands,  and  some  forestland.  The  area  also  includes  numerous  parks, 
wildlife  refuges,  and  preserves  such  as  Mad  Horse  Creek  Wildlife  Management  Area  (WMA)  to 
the  east  and  Abbotts  Meadows  WMA  to  the  north  in  New  Jersey,  and  Cedar  Swamp  WMA  to 
the  south  and  Augustine  WMA  to  the  west  in  Delaware  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).

Appendix  F 


Vegetation  communities  were  identified  from  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental 
Protection  (NJDEP)  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  offsite  areas 
that  potentially  would  be  affected  by  the  proposed  causeway.  Six  vegetative  cover  types  were 
identified  and  include:  urban  or  built-up  land,  forestland,  water,  wetlands,  barren  land,  and 
managed  wetlands.  The  listed  coverage  types  are  common  within  the  Outer  Coastal  Plain 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Table  1  lists  NJDEP  2002  LULC  within  the  proposed  PSEG  Site. 

2.1.2  Urban  or  Built-up  Lands  (Developed  Land) 

Land  use  in  the  urban  or  built-up  land  category  is  characterized  as  having  been  altered  by 
human  activities  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  The  majority  of  these  lands  on  the  site  are  related  to 
power  generation  of  HCGS  and  SGS  and  associated  structures.  The  urban  or  built-up  coverage 
type  accounts  for  358  ac,  or  44  percent,  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Upland  rights-of-way  (ROWs) 
(undeveloped)  support  shrubby  vegetation  but  are  considered  under  the  urban  or  built-up  land 
category  as  a  result  of  vegetation  maintenance  practices  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Also  included 
in  this  category  are  two  wetland  subcategories,  wetland  ROWs  and  Phragmites-tiominateti 
urban  area.  Wetland  ROWs  are  included  in  this  category  because  they  exhibit  hydric  soils  but, 
as  a  result  of  alterations,  may  not  support  vegetation  typical  of  natural  wetlands  (NJDEP  2010- 
TN2887).  Wetland  ROWs  account  for  23.8  ac,  or  3  percent,  of  the  site,  and  Phragmites- 
dominated  urban  areas  account  for  0.5  ac,  or  less  than  1  percent,  of  the  site  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  This  type  of  land  use  provides  limited  habitat  for  wildlife  use. 

2.1.3  Wetlands 

The  wetlands  category  includes  those  areas  that  are  inundated  or  saturated  by  surface  or 
ground  waters  at  a  frequency  and  duration  sufficient  to  support,  and  that  under  normal 
circumstances  do  support,  a  prevalence  of  vegetation  typically  adapted  for  life  in  saturated  soil 
conditions.  This  category  does  not  include  wetlands  that  have  been  modified  for  recreation, 
agriculture,  or  industry;  these  are  described  under  specific  use  categories  (NJDEP  2010- 
TN2887).  The  wetland  category  accounts  for  284.9  ac,  or  35  percent,  of  the  site’s  total 
available  habitat  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Wetlands  influenced  by  the  tidal  portions  of  the 
Delaware  River  system  and  the  tidal  portions  of  the  watercourses  draining  into  the  Atlantic 
Ocean  are  categorized  as  coastal  wetlands  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Coastal  wetlands  found  on 
the  site  include  saline  marshes  and  Phra gmites-ti o m i n a t e d  coastal  wetlands.  Saltmarsh 
cordgrass  ( Spartina  alterniflora)  dominates  these  wetlands  in  areas  of  high  salinity.  Brackish 
marshes  are  co-dominated  by  big  cordgrass  ( Spartina  cynosuroides ),  saltmarsh  cordgrass, 
common  reed  ( Phragmites  australis),  narrowleaf  cattail  ( Typha  angustifolia),  and  common 
threesquare  ( Schoenoplectus  pungens ).  Salt  marshes  account  for  0.2  ac,  or  less  than  1 
percent,  of  the  site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Phragmites-6 o m i n ated  coastal  wetlands  are  marsh 
areas  that  are  dominated  by  the  nonnative  invasive  Phragmites  australis  (NJDEP  2010- 
TN2887).  Phragmites- dominated  coastal  wetlands  are  the  most  common  wetland  type  found  on 
the  site  and  account  for  155.6  ac,  or  19  percent,  of  the  site’s  vegetation  cover  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).

Isolated  wetlands  and  wetlands  generally  found  in  non-tidal  lowlands  influenced  by  primary, 
secondary,  and  tertiary  courses  and  are  categorized  as  interior  wetlands  (NJDEP  2010- 
TN2887).  Interior  wetlands  found  on  the  site  include  deciduous  scrub/shrub  wetlands, 
herbaceous  wetlands,  and  Phra gmites-ti o m i n a t e d  interior  wetlands.  There  are  4.6  ac  of 
deciduous  scrub/shrub  wetlands  representing  less  than  1  percent  of  the  total  acreage  available

Appendix  F 


(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Herbaceous  wetlands  are  characterized  as  being  dominated  by 
herbaceous  species  associated  with  lake  edges,  open  flood  plains,  and  abandoned  wetlands 
agricultural  fields  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Herbaceous  wetlands  account  for  5.8  ac,  or  less  than 
1  percent,  of  the  total  acreage  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Phragmites-dominated 
interior  wetlands  are  dominated  by  the  Phragmites  australis  and  account  for  1 18.7  ac,  or  14.5 
percent,  of  the  site’s  acreage. 

2.1.4  Forestland 

Old  field  (<25%  brush  covered),  Phragmites-dominated  old  field  and  deciduous  brush/shrubland 
identified  by  NJDEP  as  occurring  on  the  site  are  categorized  under  forested  land, 
brushland/shrubland.  Vegetation  cover  could  include  early  successional  species  to  climax 
species  and  are  between  0  and  20  ft  in  height.  Old  field  is  also  covered  in  this  category  and  can 
contain  shrubs  and  grasses  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Forested  land  covers  over  107.3  ac,  or 
13  percent,  of  the  site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Old  field  (<25%  brushed  covered)  is  predominantly  covered  by  grasses,  herbaceous  species, 
tree  seedlings,  and/or  saplings.  Phragmites-dom\na\ed  old  field  contains  open  fields 
predominantly  covered  by  Phragmites  australis.  Natural  forested  areas  covered  predominantly 
with  deciduous  species  less  than  20  ft  in  height  are  classified  under  deciduous  brush/shrubland. 
This  category  also  can  include  agricultural  lands  that  have  been  overgrown  with  brush 
(NJDEP  2010-TN2887). 

Walking  surveys  conducted  by  PSEG  in  2009-10  on  brushland/scrubland  areas  indicated  that 
the  most  common  vegetation  species  were  groundsel  tree/sea  myrtle  ( Baccharis  halimifolia), 
autumn  olive  ( Eiaeagnus  umbellata),  multiflora  rose  ( Rosa  multiflora ),  Japanese  honeysuckle 
( Lonicera japonica),  poison  ivy  (Toxicodendron  radicans),  annual  ragweed  ( Ambrosia 
artemisiifoiia),  broomsedge  ( Andropogon  virgmicus),  thyme-leaf  sandwort  ( Arenaria 
serpyllifolia),  mugwort  ( Artemisia  vulgaris ),  Queen  Anne’s  lace  ( Daucus  carota),  common  spike 
rush  ( Eleocharis  palustris),  late  boneset  ( Eupatorium  serotinum),  fescue  ( Festuca  sp.),  Chinese 
lespedeza  ( Lespedeza  cuneata),  yellow  sweet  clover  ( Melilotus  officinalis ),  blue  scorpion  grass 
( Myosotis  stricta),  common  reed,  plantain  ( Plantago  virginica ),  Canada  bluegrass  ( Poa 
compressa),  green  foxtail  ( Setaria  viridis),  Canada  goldenrod  ( Solidaga  altissima),  goldenrod 
(Solidago  sp.),  and  purpletop  (Tridens  flavus )  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2.1.5  Water 

The  NJDEP  LULC  category  of  water  includes  all  areas  within  the  landmass  of  New  Jersey 
periodically  covered  by  water  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  This  includes  the  artificial  lakes  and  tidal 
rivers,  inland  bays,  and  other  tidal  waters  found  on  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  Artificial  lakes 
include  water  bodies  that  are  1  ac  and  larger.  Water  control  structures  would  be  present  on 
these  sites.  Tidal  rivers,  inland  bays,  and  other  tidal  waters  include  tidal  portions  of 
watercourses,  enclosed  tidal  bays,  and  other  tidal  water  bodies.  Land  cover  categorized  as 
water  accounts  for  approximately  46  ac  or  5.6,  percent  of  the  site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).

2.1.6  Barren  Lands 

Barren  lands  are  in  non-urban  settings  and  are  characterized  by  thin  soil,  sand,  or  rocks 
(NJDEP  201 0-TN2887).  These  land  cover  types  are  often  lacking  vegetative  cover,  or  the 
vegetation  is  sparse.  The  NJDEP  LULC  data  indicates  that  two  subcategories  of  barren  lands, 
altered  lands  and  disturbed  wetlands,  are  present  at  the  site.  Altered  lands  are  non-urban  areas 
that  have  been  changed  by  human  activities.  Disturbed  wetlands  are  formal  natural  wetlands 
that  have  been  altered  by  clearing,  grading,  leveling,  filling,  and/or  excavating.  The  soils  are 
hydric  but  lack  vegetation  or  wetland  species.  Barren  lands  represent  19.1  ac,  or  2.3  percent, 
of  the  site’s  total  acreage  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2.1.7  Managed  Wetlands 

Managed  wetlands  are  characterized  by  hydric  soils  but  do  not  support  typical  wetland 
vegetation  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Some  examples  are  stormwater  swales,  golf  fairways  and 
recreational  fields,  and  open  lawn  areas.  Managed  wetlands  account  for  3.8  ac,  or  less  than 
1  percent,  of  the  site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2.1.8  Vicinity 

The  existing  access  road  and  the  proposed  causeway  are  included  as  part  of  the  vicinity.  The 
existing  access  road  extends  3.6  mi  east-northeast  from  the  PSEG  Site  to  Alloway  Creek  Neck 
Road  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  The  ROW  is  350  ft  wide  except  where  it  travels  through  state 
owned  lands,  where  it  is  450  ft  wide.  Vegetation  cover  types  in  the  existing  access  road  include 
134  ac  of  agricultural  land,  146  ac  of  wetlands,  50  ac  of  urban/built-up  land,  39  ac  of  barren 
land,  6  ac  of  forestland,  and  4  ac  of  open  water  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  The  total  area  covered 
by  the  existing  access  road  ROW  is  379  ac.  Dominant  species  noted  along  the  access  road 
include  common  reed  and  cordgrass  (PSEG  1982-TN2889).  In  additional  to  part  of  the  State  of 
New  Jersey,  portions  of  the  State  of  Delaware  and  the  Delaware  River  also  lie  within  the  6-mi 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  NJDEP  LULC  database  would  not  provide  vegetation  cover  for 
areas  outside  of  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  As  a  result,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS) 

LULC  database  was  used  to  determine  the  vegetation  communities  for  areas  within  the  6-mi 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  USGS  database  is  composed  of  nine  LULC  categories 
(Anderson  et  al.  1976-TN2888).  Six  of  these  categories  are  applicable  to  the  PSEG  vicinity: 
urban  or  built-up  land  (developed  land),  agricultural  land,  forestland,  water,  wetlands,  and 
barren  land  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Urban  or  built-up  land  accounts  for  939  ac,  or  1.2  percent, 
of  the  available  land  use  in  the  vicinity.  Agricultural  land  includes  cultivated  crops  and  pasture. 
Approximately  17,097  ac  (23  percent)  of  the  available  vegetation  cover  in  the  vicinity  is 
agricultural. 

Forestland  in  the  vicinity  includes  deciduous,  evergreen,  and  mixed  forests  and  accounts  for 
approximately  2,653  ac,  or  less  than  4  percent,  of  the  available  vegetation  cover  in  the  vicinity. 
As  a  result  of  the  site’s  proximity  to  the  Delaware  River  and  Bay,  water  is  the  largest  available 
LULC  in  the  vicinity,  accounting  for  approximately  26,837  ac,  or  nearly  37  percent,  of  the 
vicinity.  There  are  approximately  16,555  ac  of  emergent  herbaceous  wetlands  and  8,979  ac  of 
woody  wetlands  in  the  PSEG  Site  vicinity.  Together  the  wetlands  LULC  accounts  for  nearly

Appendix  F 


35  percent,  making  it  the  second  largest  vegetation  cover  type  in  the  vicinity.  Barren  land 
makes  up  nearly  651  ac,  or  less  than  1  percent,  of  the  LULC  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2.2  Impacts  to  Habitats 

Proposed  ground-disturbing  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  offsite  areas  are  based  on  the  Site 
Utilization  Plan  (Figure  3).  Permanent  land  impacts  are  depicted  as  cross  hatched,  and 
temporary  land  impacts  are  diagonal  hatched.  Potential  areas  affected  include  the  power  block, 
cooling  tower,  concrete  batch  plant,  intake  structure,  switchyard,  offices  and  warehouses,  heavy 
haul  road,  temporary  laydown  areas,  parking  areas,  and  the  proposed  causeway. 
Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  include  clearing,  grubbing,  and  grading  of  the  site; 
installing  erosion  control  measures;  building  access  and  haul  roads;  installing  construction 
security  infrastructure;  installing  temporary  utilities  and  facilities  (e.g.,  storage  warehouses, 
concrete  batch  plant);  preparing  the  laydown,  fabrication,  and  shop  areas;  relocating  existing 
facilities  within  the  PSEG  Site;  staging  equipment;  and  preparation  activities  associated  with 
power  plant  construction  support.  The  applicant  has  not  determined  the  type  of  reactor  to  be 
built  on  site  and  is  using  a  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  to  bound  associated  construction 
and  preconstruction  impacts.  The  terrestrial  ecology  impacts  represented  in  this  section  are 
based  on  the  PPE,  and  the  actual  limits  of  disturbance  (particularly  wetlands  and  jurisdictional 
streams)  may  be  minimized  further  during  the  design  phase  after  a  specific  reactor  technology 
is  selected.  PSEG  anticipates  that  once  a  design  is  selected,  and  if  the  NRC  approves  a  CP  or 
COL,  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  could  take  68  months  to  complete 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  result  in  the  permanent  or  temporary 
disturbance  of  approximately  385  ac  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  45  ac  of  adjacent  offsite  areas  (see 
Table  2),  as  well  as  69  ac  of  the  habitat  in  the  area  of  the  proposed  causeway.  The  45  ac 
offsite  area  is  currently  owned  by  the  USACE  and  is  used  as  a  combined  disposal  facility  (CDF) 
for  disposal  of  dredge  materials.  In  addition,  the  permitted  disposal  facility  on  the  PSEG  Site  is 
used  for  disposal  of  materials  dredged  from  the  intake  structures  of  HCGS  and  SGS. 
Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  that  would  affect  terrestrial  habitats  include  clearing 
and  grubbing,  site  grading  of  upland  areas,  excavation,  and  filling  of  various  site  areas  to 
achieve  design  grades  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

A  total  of  228.6  ac  of  the  affected  area  is  considered  temporary.  This  includes  1 59.9  ac  on  the 
site,  45.2  ac  on  adjacent  offsite  areas,  and  land  disturbances  on  23.5  ac  during  construction  and 
preconstruction  of  the  proposed  causeway  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2.2.1  Urban  or  Built-up  Land  (Developed  Land) 

Approximately  91  ac,  or  approximately  26  percent,  of  urban  or  built-up  land  on  the  proposed 
PSEG  Site  would  be  used  during  construction  and  preconstruction  activities.  Temporary  uses 
would  account  for  almost  45  ac.  Permanent  use  would  equal  to  approximately  47  ac,  or 
approximately  13  percent,  of  the  urban  or  built-up  land  use  on  the  site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).

Offsite  effects  on  urban  or  built-up  land  also  occur  in  the  adjacent  offsite  areas  and  the 
proposed  causeway.  Construction  and  preconstruction  activities  in  the  adjacent  offsite  areas 
would  temporarily  make  use  of  2.4  ac  of  urban  or  built-up  lands.  The  proposed  causeway  would 
permanently  use  4.2  ac  and  temporarily  use  1 .4  ac  of  developed  lands  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

A  total  of  271  ac  of  the  affected  terrestrial  habitat  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  would  be 
permanently  converted  to  developed  land  uses  containing  structures,  pavement,  or  other 
intensively  maintained  exterior  grounds.  There  are  approximately  939  ac  of  developed  land  in 
the  vicinity  and  630,983  ac  in  the  region.  The  proposed  action  would  add  an  additional 
22  percent  of  developed  land  uses  to  the  vicinity  and  make  use  of  approximately  5  percent  of 
developed  lands  available.  These  land  areas  have  limited  value  for  wildlife  on  the  site  or  in  the 
vicinity  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2.2.2  Forestland 

The  forestland  cover  type  is  mainly  present  in  the  southeast  portion  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

Scattered  old  field  communities  consisting  of  one  or  more  land  cover  types  also  occur 
sporadically  in  the  north  and  west  portions  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Construction  and  preconstruction 
activities  would  disturb  approximately  89  ac  of  the  available  forestland  on  the  site.  Permanent 
use  would  result  in  the  loss  of  8.7  ac  of  forestland,  and  80.3  ac  would  be  temporarily  disturbed. 
The  permanent  change  of  land  use  would  result  in  the  loss  of  approximately  8  percent  of  the 
available  forestland  on  the  site.  The  majority  of  the  forestland  on  the  site  to  be  permanently  lost 
is  designated  as  deciduous  brush/shrubland  habitat  (6  ac)  and  old  field  (<25  percent  brush 
covered)  (2.6  ac)  under  the  NJ  LULC  system  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Less  than  1  ac  of  forestland  would  be  disturbed  temporarily  and  3.5  ac  would  change 
permanently  with  building  the  proposed  causeway.  No  forestland  would  be  disturbed  in 
adjacent  offsite  areas  during  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

There  is  approximately  2,653  ac  of  forestland  available  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  and 
the  proposed  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  would  permanently  remove  less  than 
1  percent  of  that  available  habitat.  The  effects  on  forestland  from  construction  and 
preconstruction  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  result  in  a  noticeable  impact  to  forestland 
in  the  vicinity  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2.2.3  Water 

The  proposed  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  would  disturb  approximately  44  ac  of 
water  habitats  on  the  site.  Approximately  40  ac  of  artificial  lakes  and  nearly  3  ac  of  tidal  rivers, 
inland  bays,  and  other  tidal  waters  would  be  permanently  disturbed.  The  permanent  loss 
represents  approximately  94  percent  of  the  available  onsite  water  habitats.  Less  than  1  ac 
would  be  temporarily  disturbed  on  the  site  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Construction  and  preconstruction  activities  on  offsite  adjacent  areas  and  the  proposed 
causeway  would  disturb  approximately  5  ac  of  available  water  habitat  in  these  areas. 

Temporary  disturbances  include  less  than  1  ac  in  adjacent  offsite  areas  and  approximately  2  ac

Appendix  F 


in  the  causeway.  Permanent  losses  offsite  occur  only  in  the  proposed  causeway  area,  and 
losses  would  be  approximately  2  ac  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

There  are  approximately  26,837  ac  of  water  habitat  in  the  vicinity.  The  permanent  loss  of  this 
habitat  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity  represents  less  than  1  percent  of  the  total  available  habitat 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  The  loss  of  these  areas  would  not  have  a  noticeable  effect  on  the 
available  habitat  in  the  area. 

2.2.4  Wetlands 

Wetlands  and  other  aquatic  habitats  are  mainly  located  in  the  extreme  eastern  and  northern 
portions  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  represent  one  of  the  largest  available  habitats  on  the  site.  The 
proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  permanently  disturb  1 08  ac  of  wetlands,  including 
0.1  ac  of  saline  marsh,  58.3  ac  of  Phragmites-d o m i n ated  coastal  wetlands,  0.9  ac  of 
herbaceous  wetlands,  4.6  ac  of  deciduous  scrub/shrub  wetlands,  and  44.1  ac  of  Phragmites- 
dominated  interior  wetlands.  There  would  be  31 .8  ac  of  temporary  effects  on  the  site,  including 
5.1  ac  of  Phragmites-dominateti  coastal  wetlands,  2.5  ac  of  herbaceous  wetlands,  and  24.2  ac 
of  Phragmites-dominated  interior  wetlands  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Offsite  effects  on  wetlands  from  the  construction  and  preconstruction  activities  in  the  offsite 
adjacent  areas  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  total  72.8  ac.  A  permanent  loss  of  23  ac 
would  occur  in  the  wetlands  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway,  including  losses  of  6.1  ac 
of  freshwater  tidal  marsh,  1 1 .2  ac  of  Phragmites-dom\na\.ed  coastal  wetlands,  1 .2  ac  of 
herbaceous  wetlands,  0.1  ac  of  mixed  scrub/shrub  wetlands  (coniferous  dominated),  and  4.4  ac 
of  Phragmites-dominaied  interior  wetlands.  A  total  of  49.8  ac  would  be  disturbed  temporarily, 
including  6.6  ac  of  freshwater  tidal  marshes,  13.2  ac  of  Phragmites-dominated  coastal  wetlands, 
and  29.2  ac  of  Phragmites-domlnaied  interior  wetlands  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Potential  effects  on  Wetland  plant  communities  may  consist  of  actual  direct  damage  to  plants, 
compaction  of  wetland  soils,  and  short-term  reductions  in  productivity.  The  proposed  causeway 
would  be  designed  as  an  elevated  structure  to  minimize  potential  effects  on  plant  communities. 
Permanent  effects  on  wetland  plant  communities  along  the  causeway  would  be  limited  to 
placement  of  piers  and  direct  shading.  Shading  potentially  could  result  in  some  alteration  of 
plant  community  makeup  under  the  causeway  and  a  reduction  in  primary  productivity.  The 
building  method  for  the  proposed  causeway  has  not  yet  been  determined,  but  construction  work 
mats  are  expected  to  be  used  within  a  50-ft  wide  easement.  Reductions  in  primary  productivity 
due  to  causeway  development  should  be  minimal  overall,  considering  the  large  area  of  adjacent 
coastal  wetlands  within  the  project  vicinity  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

A  total  of  1 31  ac  of  wetlands  would  be  lost  as  a  result  of  construction  and  preconstruction 
activities  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity.  This  represents  less  than  1  percent  of  the  25,534  ac  of 
wetlands  available  in  the  vicinity  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Most  of  these  wetlands  are  dominated 
by  near  monocultures  of  the  common  reed,  a  nonnative  aggressive  invasive  plant  species  that 
significantly  affects  Wetland  diversity  and  habitat  structure  with  resultant  significant  impacts  to 
wildlife  habitat  quality.  However,  wetlands  are  an  important  habitat,  and  the  alteration  of  these 
wetlands  would  be  noticeable.

2.2.5  Barren  Land 

Approximately  19  ac  of  onsite  barren  land  would  be  disturbed  from  construction  and 
preconstruction  activities.  This  includes  permanent  impacts  of  nearly  all  of  the  1 5  ac  of  altered 
lands  and  4  ac  of  disturbed  wetlands  (modified).  Temporary  effects  on  barren  land  on  the  site 
include  less  than  1  ac  of  the  available  disturbed  wetlands  (modified)  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Offsite  barren  land  disturbances  in  the  vicinity  include  approximately  13  ac  of  temporary  effects 
in  the  offsite  adjacent  areas.  There  are  no  barren  land  disturbances  expected  for  the 
construction  and  preconstruction  activities  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Disturbances  to  barren  lands  represent  approximately  3  percent  of  the  available  651  ac  of 
barren  land  in  the  vicinity  and  less  than  1  percent  of  the  54,164  barren  lands  available  in  the 
region  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Construction  and  preconstruction  effects  to  barren  land  would 
not  noticeably  affect  barren  land  habitats  in  the  vicinity. 

2.2.6  Managed  Wetlands 

The  applicant  proposes  to  temporarily  disturb  2.7  ac,  or  71  percent,  of  the  available  managed 
wetlands  on  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  There  will  be  no  permanent  impacts  to  managed 
wetlands,  and  there  are  no  managed  wetlands  available  in  offsite  areas  or  proposed  causeway 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  This  disturbance  would  not  noticeably  affect  managed  wetlands  in  the 
vicinity. 

2.2.7  Agricultural  Lands 

Agricultural  lands  that  potentially  would  be  affected  by  preconstruction  and  construction  include 
near  offsite  areas  along  the  proposed  causeway  route.  These  agricultural  land  cover  types  are 
located  at  the  north  end  of  the  proposed  causeway  in  Elsinboro  Township.  These  plant 
communities  consist  of  cultivated  crops  and  adventitious  weedy  species.  The  proposed 
causeway  would  disturb  12.6  ac  of  agricultural  land  in  the  vicinity.  The  causeway  would 
permanently  disturb  12.4  ac  and  temporarily  disturb  0.2  ac.  No  permanent  or  temporary 
impacts  to  agricultural  lands  would  result  from  onsite  building  activities  at  the  ESP  site.  The 
affected  agricultural  lands  represent  less  than  1  percent  of  agricultural  lands  available  in  the 
vicinity  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  These  impacts  would  not  noticeably  affect  the  available 
agricultural  habitats  in  the  vicinity. 

2.3  Noise  and  Fugitive  Dust  Impacts 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  that  produce  noise  and 
fugitive  dust  likely  would  displace  wildlife  into  habitat  surrounding  work  areas.  Peak  noise  level 
associated  with  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  be  102  A-weighted  decibels 
(dBA)  50  feet  away  from  work  areas  and  would  attenuate  to  58  dBA  1 ,500  ft  away.  Behavioral 
effects  attributed  to  noise  could  decrease  chances  for  wildlife  survival  and  successful 
reproduction.  Effects  on  wildlife  can  range  from  nonexistent  to  serious,  depending  on  the 
species  and  the  situation  (Larkin  1996-TN772).  During  frequent  noise  events  that  exceeded 
80  dBA,  waterfowl  activities  demonstrated  only  minimal  responses  to  individual  events  with  no

noticeable  disruptions  of  typical  behavior  patterns,  indicating  that  avian  species  quickly 
accommodated  to  the  noise  events  (Fleming  et  al.  2001-TN2419).  It  is  anticipated  that  general 
noise  levels  from  preconstruction  and  construction  would  dissipate  within  a  short  distance  to 
ambient  levels  well  below  that  which  would  normally  cause  a  response  in  wildlife  (NRC  2013- 
TN2654). 

Principal  noise  sources  at  an  operating  nuclear  power  plant  include  natural  draft  and 
mechanical  draft  cooling  towers,  transformers,  and  loudspeakers  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  The 
bounding  noise  level  from  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  for 
operational  noise  emissions  is  associated  with  fan-assisted  natural  draft  cooling  towers 
(NDCTs),  as  presented  in  the  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report  in  the  PSEG  ESP  application 
(PSEG  2014-TN3453).  The  estimated  dBA  noise  emission  for  this  type  of  cooling  tower  is 
60  dBA  at  1 ,000  feet.  Noise  measurements  recorded  on  the  site  demonstrate  that  existing 
noise  levels  attenuate  to  a  maximum  of  51 .6  dBA  (a  value  typical  of  ambient  low  noise 
environments)  near  the  site  boundary  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Noise  from  onsite  sources  associated  with  the  proposed  site  attenuates  with  distance.  For 
example,  a  source  with  a  noise  level  of  50  dBA  at  1 ,000  ft  has  a  noise  level  of  44  dBA  at 
2,000  ft  from  the  source,  and  a  source  with  a  noise  level  of  60  dBA  at  1 ,000  ft  has  a  dBA  of  54 
at  2,000  ft.  A  2009  baseline  ambient  noise  survey  indicates  noise  from  sources  at  the  existing 
HCGS  and  SGS  facilities  attenuates  to  levels  that  generally  represent  background  noise  values 
in  natural  environments  (Table  3).  This  noise  level  is  similar  to  that  measured  near  the  PSEG 
Site  boundary.  Noise  sources  within  the  adjacent  marsh  environment  include  wind,  rustling  of 
reeds  and  grasses  (Phragmites),  and  animal  noises  (frog  calls,  bird  songs,  etc.)  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  There  are  no  known  Federally  listed  threatened  or  endangered  terrestrial  species 
within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  that  potentially  could  be  affected  by  plant  operation  noise.  In 
addition,  the  expected  noise  level  is  well  below  threshold  levels  that  would  generally  exhibit  a 
response  in  wildlife  populations.  Thus,  effects  of  noise  from  operation  of  the  proposed  site  are 
expected  to  be  minimal.

PSEG  proposes  to  suppress  fugitive  dust  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  offsite  preconstruction  and 
construction  areas  by  using  water  from  local  stormwater  retention  ponds  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 
The  impact  of  fugitive  dust  to  wildlife  species  would  be  negligible. 

2.4  Potential  for  Wildlife  Collisions  with  Human-made  Structures 

Avian  and  bat  collisions  with  human-made  structures  can  be  attributed  to  numerous  factors 
related  to  species  characteristics  such  as  flight  behavior,  age,  habitat  use,  seasonal  and  diurnal 
habitats,  and  environmental  characteristics  such  as  weather,  topography,  land  use,  and 
orientation  of  the  structures.  This  is  a  particular  concern  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  because 
it  is  in  the  Atlantic  Flyway,  a  major  bird  migration  route.  Additionally,  bat  hibernacula  are  known 
to  occur  in  northern  and  central  portions  of  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Bird  and  bat  collisions 
with  construction  equipment,  such  as  cranes  or  new  structures,  have  the  potential  to  occur  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  Studies  of  avian  and  bat  collisions  with  elevated  construction  equipment  are 
lacking.  However,  surveys  conducted  in  the  vicinity  of  other  human-made  structures,  such  as 
NDCTs  and  wind  turbines,  indicate  that  avian  and  bat  mortalities  as  a  result  of  collisions  could 
occur.  The  findings  of  NUREG-1437,  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License 
Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants  (GEIS),  demonstrated  that  mortalities  as  a  result  of  avian  collisions 
with  existing  structures  at  nuclear  power  plants  are  minor  and  typically  occur  with  structures 
greater  than  300  feet  tall  (NRC  201 3-TN2654).  In  addition,  a  study  on  bat  collisions  with  wind 
turbine  towers  indicated  that  only  a  small  fraction  of  bats  collide  with  towers,  and  the  collisions 
weren’t  sufficient  to  alter  populations  (Erickson  et  al.  2002-TN771).  The  tallest  structure  on  the 
PSEG  Site  is  the  512-ft  NDCT  associated  with  HCGS  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  During  a  yearlong 
study  from  1985  to  1986,  PSEG  counted  30  avian  mortalities  with  no  Federally  or  State-listed 
endangered  or  threatened  species  noted  (PSEG  1987-TN2893).  Therefore,  the  effects  of  such 
collisions  during  preconstruction  and  construction  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  be 
negligible. 

2.5  Cooling  System  Impacts  on  Vegetation 

Operation  of  cooling  systems  for  a  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  poses 
the  most  significant  risk  to  vegetation.  The  proposed  cooling  systems  will  use  a  recirculating 
(closed  cycle)  cooling  water  system  that  includes  NDCTs,  mechanical  draft  cooling  towers 
(MDCTs),  or  fan-assisted  cooling  towers  during  normal  operations.  The  circulating  water 
system  (CWS)  cooling  towers  would  be  the  tallest  structure  on  the  site  at  a  potential  height  of 
600  ft  and  would  dissipate  heat  at  a  rate  of  1.508  *  1010  Btu/hour  with  evaporation  losses  as 
high  as  25,264  gpm  and  a  drift  loss  as  high  as  12  gpm.  The  service  water  system  (SWS)  would 
provide  cooling  functions  for  systems  not  serviced  by  the  CWS  during  operation  and  during 
cooldown,  refueling,  and  plant  startup  modes.  The  shorter  SWS  cooling  towers  dissipate  heat 
at  a  maximum  rate  of  2,284  gpm  and  a  maximum  drift  loss  of  4  gpm  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 
Because  the  effects  from  the  SWS  cooling  towers  would  be  less  significant  than  the  CWS 
cooling  towers,  discussion  of  potential  impacts  as  a  result  of  cooling  system  operation  will  be 
limited  to  the  CWS  cooling  towers. 

Heat  from  operation  of  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  transferred  to  the 
atmosphere  in  the  form  of  water  vapor  and  drift  from  cooling  towers.  Vapor  plumes  and  drift  can 
affect  crops,  ornamental  vegetation,  and  native  plants,  while  water  losses  can  affect  shoreline

Appendix  F 


habitat.  Total  dissolved  solids  found  in  the  vapor  and  drift  have  the  potential  to  be  deposited 
onto  foliage  or  soil  and  cause  visible  damage  (e.g.,  necrotic  tissue  and  other  deformities)  and/or 
chronic  effects  (e.g.,  reduced  growth  and  increased  susceptibility  to  disease).  NUREG-1555, 
Section  5. 3. 3. 2,  indicates  that  plants  are  generally  not  damaged  by  salt  deposition  rates  of  1  to 
2  kg/ha  per  month.  Salt  deposition  rates  greater  than  10  kg/ha  per  month  during  the  growing 
season  have  the  potential  to  cause  leaf  damage  in  some  vegetation  species  (NRC  2013- 
TN2654). 

The  linear  mechanical  draft  cooling  tower  (LMDCT)  has  greater  potential  for  salt  drift  than  other 
proposed  cooling  tower  structures.  Therefore,  discussion  of  salt  deposition  as  a  result  of 
cooling  tower  drift  will  be  limited  to  the  deposition  rate  of  the  LMDCT.  The  results  of  Seasonal 
and  Annual  Cooling  Tower  Impacts  prediction  code  modeling  conducted  by  PSEG  for  the 
proposed  site  shows  that  the  maximum  salt  deposition  rate  during  any  season  is  1.31  kg/ha  per 
month  (1.17  Ib/ac  per  month)  during  the  winter.  The  maximum  expected  salt  deposition  rate  in 
any  direction  is  0.89  kg/ha  per  month  (0.80  Ib/ac  per  month).  These  salt  deposition  rates  fall 
within  the  rate  described  by  NUREG-1555  as  generally  not  damaging  to  plants  (NRC  1996- 
TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289). 

Analyses  performed  by  PSEG  have  shown  the  cooling  tower  drift  over  terrestrial  habitats  is 
primarily  to  the  east  (within  coastal  wetlands)  (Figure  4)  and  southeast  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Most 
of  the  plant  communities  within  the  salt  drift  zone  that  would  be  exposed  to  drift  from  the  PSEG 
cooling  towers  are  salt  marsh  or  brackish  marsh  ecosystems  dominated  by  species  ( Phragmites 
australis  and  Spartina  alterniflora)  with  medium  to  high  salinity  tolerance.  Surveys  conducted 
previously  at  the  PSEG  Site  did  not  record  any  impacts  from  salt  deposition  due  to  drift  from  the 
existing  HCGS  NDCT  for  any  specific  plant  species.  Damage  to  native  vegetation  has  not 
occurred  at  HCGS,  which  uses  brackish  water  for  cooling  and  represents  a  comparatively  high 
probability  of  impact  from  operation  of  natural  draft  towers  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999- 
TN289;  PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Drift  deposition  also  has  the  potential  to  damage  vegetation  through  soil  salinization.  However, 
soil  salinization  usually  does  not  occur  in  areas  where  rainfall  is  sufficient  to  leach  salts  from  the 
soil  profile.  In  humid  environments,  effects  of  drift  deposition  on  soils  appear  to  be  transitory,  if 
they  can  be  detected  at  all  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289). 

Previous  evaluations  of  increased  fogging,  icing,  humidity,  and/or  precipitation  due  to  cooling 
tower  drift  have  been  conducted  for  nuclear  power  plants  with  cooling  towers  (natural  draft  and 
mechanical  draft).  No  significant  impacts  were  reported  as  a  result  of  these  evaluations 
(NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289).  In  addition,  based  on  an  analysis  conducted  for  the 
proposed  site,  the  duration  of  any  fogging  and  other  cooling  tower  induced  precipitation  events 
would  be  expected  to  be  low  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).

Based  on  these  results,  combined  with  the  nature  of  the  local  plant  communities,  the  potential 
effects  of  proposed  site  cooling  tower  operation  on  surrounding  plant  communities  on  the  PSEG 
Site  and  in  the  vicinity  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289). 

2.6  Impacts  of  Artificial  Light 

Artificial  light  can  affect  wildlife  by  both  disorientation  and  attraction.  Night  migrating  bird 
species  can  be  impacted  when  meteorological  conditions,  such  as  inclement  weather,  bring 
them  into  close  proximity  with  artificial  lighting.  Birds  may  become  disoriented  and  collide  with 
each  other  or  structures,  become  exhausted,  or  be  taken  by  predators  (Longcore  2004- 
TN3189).  Artificial  lighting  may  affect  terrestrial  mammal  nocturnal  predator-prey  relationships 
(Beier  2006-TN2380).  Light  pollution  also  may  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  the 
selection  of  flight  routes  by  bats  (Stone  et  al.  2009-TN3190).  When  exposed  to  artificial  light, 
green  frogs  were  found  to  exhibit  fewer  advertisement  calls  and  moved  more  frequently  than 
they  did  under  ambient  light  conditions;  this  could  result  in  potential  impacts  on  recruitment 
rates,  leading  to  effects  on  population  dynamics  (Baker  and  Richardson  2006-TN2379). 

Down  shielding  of  lights  to  prevent  light  from  being  directed  into  the  night  sky  can  help  reduce 
the  effect  on  migratory  birds.  This  means  lights  can  be  shielded  so  that  the  pattern  of 
illumination  is  below  the  horizontal  plane  of  the  light  fixture.  However,  this  will  not  prevent 
potential  impacts  to  other  species,  such  as  frogs  (Longcore  2004-TN3189). 

Additional  lighting  effects  could  be  lessened  by  using  low  sodium  lighting.  Down  shielding,  as 
described  above,  could  be  employed  to  further  mitigate  certain  impacts.  Operating  experience 
with  HCGS  has  shown  that  bird  collisions  with  units  have  not  been  a  noticeable  issue 
(PSEG  1987-TN2893).  It  is  not  expected  that  the  incremental  effect  of  lighting  added  for  the 
proposed  site  would  increase  impacts  to  noticeable  levels,  particularly  if  down  shielding  and 
other  best  management  practices  (BMPs)  were  to  be  employed.  With  the  use  of  appropriate 
BMPs,  impacts  to  terrestrial  wildlife  from  the  additional  lighting  at  the  new  PSEG  Site  are 
expected  to  be  minimal. 

2.7  Impacts  of  Increased  Vehicle  Traffic 

Increased  traffic  as  a  result  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  has  the 
potential  to  increase  wildlife  mortality  caused  by  vehicle  collisions.  PSEG  estimates  that  the 
onsite  workforce  could  increase  by  600  employees  during  normal  day-to-day  operations  and  by 
1,000  employees  during  refueling  operations  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  The  increase  in  workforce 
population  would  increase  the  amount  of  vehicle  traffic  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Local 
wildlife  populations  could  decline  if  roadkill  rates  exceed  the  rates  of  reproduction  and 
immigration.  However,  roadkills  occur  frequently,  and  wildlife  populations  are  not  significantly 
affected  (Forman  and  Alexander  1998-TN2250).  No  individual  Federally  or  State-listed 
threatened  or  endangered  species  were  identified  that  would  be  adversely  affected  by  vehicle 
traffic.  Therefore,  the  effect  of  increased  traffic  on  terrestrial  wildlife  populations  on  the  site  and 
in  the  vicinity  would  be  minimal. 

The  proposed  causeway  will  be  constructed  on  piers  to  preserve  wildlife  travel  corridors.  By 
allowing  wildlife  travel  below  the  causeway,  this  elevated  design  also  will  help  to  minimize  the 


NUREG-2168 


F. 3. 3-24 


November  2015 


F-270 


Appendix  F 


possibility  for  wildlife-vehicle  collisions  and  wildlife  mortality  over  conventional  roadways  built  on 
embankments.  The  elevated  design  of  this  structure  will  also  minimize  potential  impacts  to 
plant  communities.  Permanent  impacts  to  wetland  plant  communities  along  the  causeway  will 
be  limited  to  placement  of  piers  and  direct  shading.  Shading  could  potentially  result  in  some 
alteration  of  plant  community  makeup  under  the  bridge  and  a  reduction  in  primary  productivity 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  However,  because  the  effect  will  be  to  a  small  area  relative  to  the 
overall  plant  community,  impacts  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

2.8  Impacts  to  Shoreline  Habitat 

Based  on  the  proposed  Site  Utilization  Plan  (as  shown  in  Figure  3),  the  western  shoreline  of 
PSEG  will  be  modified  with  the  development  of  shoreline  plant  features  that  include  the  water 
intake  structure,  heavy  haul  road,  and  barge  facility.  In  total,  9.5  ac  of  nearshore  water  and 
riparian  shoreline  will  be  impacted  below  the  coastal  wetland  boundary,  also  known  as  the  New 
Jersey  upper  wetland  boundary.  Based  on  the  Site  Utilization  Plan,  the  shoreline  will  be 
constructed  as  a  stabilized  shoreline  (using  riprap  or  other  appropriate  treatment)  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  This  will  be  the  condition  of  the  shoreline  during  the  operational  phase  of  the  PSEG 
project. 

The  already  disturbed  nature  of  the  shoreline  before  the  proposed  stabilization  likely  provided 
marginal  habitat  for  most  terrestrial  species.  The  main  use  of  these  areas  would  have  been 
some  riparian  zone/edge  birds,  as  well  as  waterfowl  and  other  birds  on  the  open  water.  Open 
water  habitat  will  remain  during  the  operational  stage  of  the  PSEG  project  (PSEG  2014- 
TN3452).  The  riparian  zone,  on  the  other  hand,  will  provide  little  habitat  with  the  establishment 
of  the  riprap  bank.  However,  there  are  large  areas  of  similar  shoreline  habitat  of  higher  quality 
in  the  vicinity  of  the  site.  Therefore,  it  is  expected  that  the  shoreline  modifications  in  place 
during  the  operational  stage  of  the  PSEG  project  will  have  a  negligible  impact  on  terrestrial 
wildlife  populations. 

2.9  Impacts  of  Transmission  Lines 

This  section  addresses  potential  operational  effects  of  transmission  systems  on  terrestrial 
resources.  This  includes  the  transmission  system  itself  and  any  ROW  associated  with  the 
proposed  site.  The  transmission  needs  for  the  proposed  site  include  two  to  three  new  onsite 
lines  crossing  between  two  proposed  switchyards  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Two  potential  offsite 
transmission  line  routes  are  being  considered  by  the  regional  transmission  line  provider  to 
support  grid  stability  and  are  discussed  as  part  of  cumulative  impacts. 

2.9.1  Vegetation 

The  Public  Service  Electric  and  Gas  Company  (PSE&G)  is  responsible  for  maintaining  the 
transmission  lines  and  rights-of-way  associated  with  HCGS  and  SGS  in  New  Jersey  and  to 
ensure  that  important  terrestrial  habitats  and  species  are  protected  in  accordance  with  resource 
agency  approved  BMPs.  Potential  effects  from  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  new 
transmission  systems  are  based  on  established  procedures  PSE&G  uses  for  existing  lines 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452). 


November  2015 


F. 3. 3-25 


NUREG-2168 


F-271 


Appendix  F 


PSE&G  transmission  lines  and  rights-of-way  are  surveyed  by  air  and  ground  approximately 
five  times  a  year  to  ensure  the  physical  and  electrical  integrity  of  transmission  line  supports, 
hardware,  insulators,  and  conductors  are  acceptable  for  safe  and  reliable  service.  Climbing 
inspections  of  structures  are  performed  approximately  every  three  years,  with  the  frequency 
dependent  on  the  age  of  the  line  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

PSE&G  employs  maintenance  measures  to  keep  woody  vegetation  at  least  30  ft  from 
conductors  wherever  transmission  lines  cross  wooded  areas.  The  primary  method  used  for 
maintenance  of  the  transmission  line  ROW  is  mechanical  clearing.  For  areas  that  contain 
wetlands,  ROW  maintenance  is  typically  performed  manually  in  accordance  with  resource 
agency  approved  BMPs.  In  accordance  with  an  integrated  pest  management  program, 
herbicides  are  used  to  prevent  sprouting  from  fast  growing  woody  vegetation.  For  any  herbicide 
applications  that  may  be  required  in  or  near  waterways  or  wetlands,  only  herbicides  specifically 
labeled  for  use  in  waterways  are  used,  consistent  with  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency 
(EPA)  label  requirements  and  NJDEP  regulations.  Periodic  inspections  are  conducted  to 
ensure  that  appropriate  clearances  between  tall  vegetation  and  conductors  are  maintained 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Important  habitats  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  wetlands.  It  is  not  anticipated  that  transmission  line 
ROW  maintenance  normally  required  to  control  woody  vegetation  will  be  necessary  on  the  site 
because  the  onsite  transmission  lines  run  through  herbaceous  coastal  wetlands.  These  onsite 
coastal  wetlands  are  disturbed  habitats  dominated  by  common  reed  that  does  not  grow  tall 
enough  to  interfere  with  overhead  transmission  lines.  Consequently,  onsite  transmission  line 
maintenance  activities  most  likely  will  be  restricted  to  minimal  mechanical  clearing  and/or 
herbicide  application.  Therefore,  impacts  to  important  terrestrial  habitats  resulting  from  the 
operation  and  maintenance  of  onsite  transmission  line  systems  are  expected  to  be  minimal 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

Saltmarsh  cordgrass  is  the  only  identified  important  plant  group  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Saltmarsh 
cordgrass  is  essential  to  the  function  of  the  coastal  marsh  and  is  an  important  component  of 
coastal  wetlands  in  marsh  restoration  sites.  Cordgrass  has  not  been  observed  in  onsite  areas 
near  the  planned  transmission  lines.  Furthermore,  the  transmission  lines  are  elevated  and 
would  not  interfere  with  any  future  establishment  of  these  plants  on  the  site.  Also,  as  stated 
above,  the  need  for  routine  use  of  herbicides  or  mechanical  clearing  as  part  of  any  onsite 
transmission  line  maintenance  activities  would  be  minimal,  if  required  at  all.  Therefore,  impacts 
to  saltmarsh  cordgrass  associated  with  the  maintenance  and  operation  of  the  onsite 
transmission  lines  are  not  anticipated  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

2.9.2  Wildlife 

Section  4. 5. 6. 2  of  the  GEIS  provides  a  thorough  discussion  of  bird  collisions  associated  with 
operating  transmission  lines.  Avian  collisions  with  transmission  systems  are  dependent  on  site- 
specific  variables  such  as  nesting,  foraging,  and  roosting.  Additionally,  factors  such  as  line 
orientation  to  flight  patterns  and  movements,  species  composition,  and  line  design  are  factors  in 
avian  collisions.  The  GEIS  determined  that  bird  collisions  with  transmission  lines  were  more 
likely  to  occur  with  large-bodied  species  such  as  raptors,  and  smaller  species  such  as  song 
birds  were  more  likely  to  collide  with  towers  (NRC  201 3-TN2654).

Appendix  F 


Threatened  and  endangered  species  of  large-bodied  and  small-bodied  birds  have  the  potential 
to  be  affected  where  transmission  lines  pass  through  areas  where  these  species  are 
concentrated.  Several  State-listed  species  have  the  potential  to  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site  or  in 
the  vicinity.  However,  field  surveys  conducted  from  2009  to  2010  did  not  identify  significant 
concentrations  of  these  species  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Additionally,  PSEG’s  wildlife 
management  practices  would  be  required  to  comply  with  the  Migratory  Bird  Treaty  Act  regarding 
nest  removals  and  maintenance  activities.  PSEG  includes  appropriate  measures  in  the  design 
of  transmission  lines  to  reduce  the  potential  for  avian  collisions.  In  addition,  current  design 
standards  for  phase-to-phase  and  phase-to-ground  clearances  for  high  transmission  voltages 
are  generally  considerably  greater  than  wing-to-wing  or  wing-to-foot  spans  for  even  the  larger 
birds.  Electrocution  is  rarely  a  problem  for  500  kV  transmission  lines  (PSEG  2012-TN2389). 
Therefore,  bird  mortality  resulting  from  the  collisions  with  transmission  line  systems  on  the 
PSEG  Site  or  in  the  vicinity  is  expected  to  be  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  mortality  and  would  not 
pose  as  a  significant  threat  to  overall  populations. 

Transmission  line  ROW  management  practices  have  the  potential  to  affect  wildlife  on  the  PSEG 
Site  and  vicinity.  ROW  development  represents  a  barrier  to  larger,  more  mobile  species  that 
require  continuous  tracts  of  forested  habitat  and  to  smaller,  less  mobile  species  that  have 
difficulty  crossing  disturbed  habitat  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  Much  of  the  proposed  transmission 
line  ROWs  on  the  site  have  been  developed  previously  or  are  dominated  by  common  reed 
(PSEG  2014-TN3452).  Because  of  the  vegetation  types  in  the  proposed  onsite  transmission 
line  corridor,  PSEG  does  not  expect  a  need  to  conduct  maintenance  activities  of  the 
transmission  line  ROWs.  Transmission  line  ROWs  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  not  expected  to 
adversely  impact  terrestrial  wildlife  species. 

2.9.3  Electromagnetic  Fields 

Studies  have  indicated  that  electromagnetic  fields  (EMFs)  associated  with  transmission  lines 
could  affect  flora  and  fauna  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  Plant  foliage  in  the  vicinity  of  strong 
electromagnetic  fields  (greater  than  1 ,100  kV)  has  been  shown  to  incur  damage  to  tips  of  leaves 
and  buds,  similar  to  the  stresses  that  may  occur  as  a  result  of  drought.  However,  the  damage  is 
limited  to  those  plants  located  close  to  transmission  lines  and  generally  does  not  interfere  with 
overall  growth.  Additionally,  transmission  lines  energized  at  levels  less  than  765  kV  are  not 
expected  to  affect  most  terrestrial  fauna.  The  transmission  lines  that  would  be  constructed  for 
PSEG  would  operate  only  at  500  kV  (PSEG  2014-TN3452),  which  is  much  lower  than  the 
1,100  kV  threshold  for  EMF  effects  on  flora  and  765  kV  threshold  for  terrestrial  fauna. 

Therefore,  the  increased  EMF  posed  by  the  operation  of  the  proposed  transmission  lines  is 
expected  to  have  only  a  minimal  impact  on  terrestrial  flora  and  fauna. 

3.0  FEDERALLY  LISTED  SPECIES  CONSIDERED 

Based  on  NRC  review  of  sources  from  FWS  and  the  states  of  Delaware  and  New  Jersey,  one 
Federally  threatened  turtle  species  and  one  Federally  proposed  endangered  mammal  species 
were  identified  with  the  potential  to  be  present  in  the  site  vicinity.  These  species  are  the  bog 
turtle  ( Gyptemys  muhlenbergii)  and  northern  long-eared  bat  ( Myotis  septentrionalis). 
Accordingly,  this  BA  focuses  on  evaluating  the  potential  effects  from  building  and  operating  a 
new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  on  the  bog  turtle  and  northern  long-eared  bat.

3.1  Bog  Turtle 

3.1.1  Species  Description 

The  Federally  threatened  bog  turtle  measures  up  to  4  in.  long  and  is  dark  brown  with  distinct 
orange  patches  on  either  side  of  its  head.  Its  carapace  scutes  are  brown  or  black  and  may 
have  a  yellow  or  reddish  center,  and  its  plastron  is  brownish-black.  The  bog  turtle’s  limbs  are 
brown  and  may  have  variable  amounts  of  dark  yellow,  orange,  or  red  blotching.  Male  bog 
turtles  have  a  concave  plastron,  long  thick  tail,  and  long  foreclaws.  The  females  have  a  flat  to 
semi-convex  plastron  (CWFNJ  2014-TN3288). 

3.1.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

Bog  turtles  occur  in  disjointed  populations  in  the  eastern  United  States  from  New  York  to 
northern  Georgia.  Populations  of  bog  turtles  in  New  Jersey  occur  in  isolated  colonies  in 
northern,  central,  and  southern  counties  including  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  The  largest 
populations  can  be  found  in  the  Wallkill  River  and  Paulinskill  River  watersheds  (CWFNJ  2014- 
TN3288). 

Bog  turtles  inhabit  fens,  bogs,  and  wet  meadows  characterized  by  mucky,  organic  soil  that 
remains  saturated  by  groundwater.  Plant  communities  in  bog  turtle  habitat  vary  in  species 
composition  but  are  almost  always  dominated  by  low-growing  grasses,  sedges,  rushes,  ferns, 
scattered  cattails,  and  forbs.  Shrub  and  tree  cover  is  typically  low,  and  physical  features  of  the 
habitat  include  spring-derived  rivulets;  shallow,  mucky  pools;  and  abundant  sedge  or  moss- 
covered  hummocks.  Bog  turtles  spend  much  of  their  time  hiding  in  cool,  soft  muck  that  provides 
cover  and  aids  in  thermoregulation  during  warm  summer  months.  After  emerging  from 
subterranean  hibernacula  in  the  spring,  they  spend  much  of  that  season  into  early  summer 
basking  on  hummocks  and  other  areas.  Mating  occurs  primarily  in  May  and  June.  Females  lay 
their  eggs  in  drier  areas  of  the  marsh  such  as  sedge  and  moss  hummocks  or  rotted  tree 
stumps.  The  diet  of  the  bog  turtle  is  mainly  invertebrates,  particularly  slugs.  They  also  may 
feed  on  carrion,  small  berries,  sedge  seeds,  young  cattail  shoots,  and  duckweed.  Once 
abundant  throughout  New  Jersey,  the  bog  turtle  is  now  restricted  to  the  remaining  rural  portions 
of  the  state,  including  Sussex,  Warren,  Hunterdon,  and  Salem  counties.  They  require  large 
contiguous  areas  of  land  for  dispersal.  Intense  land-uses  affect  bog  turtle  habitat  through  direct 
alteration  of  wetlands  and  secondary  effects  such  as  stormwater  inputs,  water  table  drawdown, 
and  nutrient  enrichment  (NJDEP  2014-TN3287). 

3.1.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

The  FWS  listed  the  northern  population  of  the  bog  turtle  on  the  Federal  List  of  Endangered  and 
Threatened  Wildlife  under  the  ESA  on  November  4,  1997.  The  bog  turtle  experienced  a 
50  percent  reduction  in  range  and  population  from  1976  to  1996.  In  New  Jersey,  there  were 
68  recorded  locations  where  the  bog  turtle  was  found  in  1978.  In  1989,  44  of  the  recorded  New 
Jersey  sites  surveyed  indicated  that  the  bog  turtle  was  no  longer  present.  In  2000,  there  were 
350  extant  sites  comprising  the  entire  northern  population,  which  was  an  increase  from  the 
191  known  extant  sites  reported  in  1996.  Of  those  350  extant  sites,  165  known  extant  sites 
were  located  in  New  Jersey  (FWS  2001-TN3315).

Appendix  F 


The  primary  threats  to  bog  turtle  populations  in  New  Jersey  have  been  habitat  loss  because  of 
natural  succession,  habitat  fragmentation,  and  illegal  collection.  Vegetation  succession  has  a 
negative  effect  on  bog  turtles  by  eliminating  open  areas,  resulting  in  the  reduction  of  suitable 
nesting  sites  and  basking  habitat.  Important  microclimates  may  also  be  eliminated  and  a 
monoculture  created  with  the  infiltration  of  invasive  plant  species  such  as  Phragmites  australis , 
reed  canary  grass  ( Phalaris  arundinacea),  or  purple  loosestrife  ( Lycopodium  sabinifolium).  Bog 
turtle  colonies  are  isolated  with  habitat  fragmentation,  which  has  the  potential  to  result  in 
decreased  genetic  diversity  and  to  affect  the  colonization  of  new  sites.  Bog  turtles  also  are 
killed  when  trying  to  cross  roadways  that  split  wetlands  (CWFNJ  2014-TN3288). 

The  bog  turtle  was  recorded  historically  for  Artificial  Island  and  the  vicinity  during  a  study 
conducted  between  1972  and  1978.  There  were  no  records  for  this  species  in  the  latest 
surveys  conducted  by  PSEG  in  2009  to  2010.  Methods  used  for  surveying  reptiles  and 
amphibians  on  the  PSEG  Site  during  2009  to  2010  included  general  site  reconnaissance  and 
observation,  evening  anuran  (frog)  call  surveys  in  the  spring,  and  transect  surveys  along 
eight  transects  also  used  for  bird  and  mammal  surveys.  Representative  portions  of  the 
proposed  causeway  and  areas  adjacent  to  the  existing  access  road  were  also  surveyed 
qualitatively  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

3.2  Northern  Long-eared  Bat 

3.2.1  Species  Description 

The  northern  long-eared  bat  is  a  medium  size  bat  species  with  adults  averaging  0.2  to 
0.3  ounces.  Female  bats  are  slightly  larger  than  their  male  counterparts.  Their  average  body 
length  is  from  3.0  to  3.7  inches  long.  They  are  medium  to  dark  brown  on  their  back,  ears,  and 
wing  membranes  and  tawny  to  pale  brown  on  their  ventral  side.  The  most  distinguishing 
characteristic  of  the  bat  is  its  long  ears,  which  can  extend  up  to  0.2  inches  beyond  its  muzzle. 
The  ears  are  pointed  and  symmetrical  with  a  long  tragus  (0.4  inches)  (78  FR  61046-TN3207). 

3.2.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

The  northern  long-eared  bat’s  eastern  range  extends  from  Maine  to  the  Florida  panhandle. 
However,  populations  are  found  in  patches  and  are  more  common  in  the  northern  part  of  its 
range  than  the  southern  portions.  Over  780  hibernacula  have  been  discovered  in  its  range  in 
the  United  States  with  only  a  few  individuals  in  each  hibernaculum  (78  FR  61046-TN3207). 

Hibernacula  used  by  northern  long-eared  bats  are  typically  large,  with  large  passages,  constant 
cool  temperatures,  high  humidity,  and  no  air  currents.  Additionally,  northern  long-eared  bats 
have  been  seen  overwintering  in  railroad  tunnels,  storm  sewers,  and  other  unexpected  retreats. 
In  the  summer,  northern  long-eared  bats  roost  underneath  bark  or  in  crevices  or  cavities  of  live 
trees  and  snags  of  various  tree  species.  Tree  species  include  black  oak  ( Quercus  velutina), 
northern  red  oak  {Quercus  rubra),  silver  maple  {Acer  saccharinum),  black  locust  ( Robinia 
pseudoacacia ),  American  beech  ( Fagus  grandifolia),  sugar  maple  {Acer  saccharum),  sourwood 
{Oxydendrum  arboreum),  and  shortleaf  pine  {Pinus  echinata).  They  also  have  been  observed 
roosting  in  or  under  the  eaves  of  human-made  structures  such  as  barns,  buildings,  sheds,  and 
cabins.  Northern  long-eared  bats  are  not  a  long  distance  migratory  species,  and  movements

between  summer  and  winter  hibernacula  are  between  35  mi  and  55  mi.  Breeding  occurs 
between  late  July  and  early  October.  Home  ranges  are  approximately  46  to  425  ac  for  females 
and  161  ac  for  males.  Northern  long-eared  bats  emerge  at  dusk  and  fly  along  hillsides  through 
forest  understory,  gleaning  insects  from  vegetation.  They  have  a  diverse  diet  of  insects,  most 
commonly  beetles,  moths,  and  arachnids.  Mature  forests  are  an  important  habitat  for  the 
northern  long-eared  bat’s  foraging  technique  (78  FR  61046-TN3207). 

Maternity  roosts  and  hibernacula  for  the  northern  long-eared  bat  are  known  to  occur  in  the 
following  New  Jersey  counties:  Atlantic,  Bergen,  Burlington,  Camden,  Hunterdon,  Mercer, 
Morris,  Ocean,  Passaic,  Salem,  Somerset,  Sussex,  and  Warren  (FWS  2014-TN3208).  No 
surveys  were  conducted  on  the  PSEG  Site  for  bats  species.  However,  suitable  habitat  for 
hibernacula  and  maternity  roosts  are  limited  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  Important  foraging  habitat  does 
not  exist  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Northern  long-eared  bat  are  known  to  occur  in  the  northern  and 
central  portions  of  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (78  FR  61046-TN3207). 

3.2.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

The  northern  long-eared  bat  was  proposed  for  listing  under  the  ESA  on  December  2,  2013.  The 
experienced  a  severe  and  rapid  decline,  estimated  at  approximately  99  percent  since  the 
introduction  of  white  nose  disease  (first  discovered  in  2007)  in  its  northeast  range.  The  primary 
threat  to  the  northern  long-eared  bat  is  attributed  to  white  nose  disease  caused  by  the  fungus 
Geomyces  destructans.  The  threat  of  white  nose  disease  is  expected  to  increase  and  continue 
to  extirpate  northern  long-eared  bat  populations  as  it  spreads  throughout  its  range  (78  FR 
61046-TN3207). 

4.0  PROPOSED  ACTION  EFFECTS  ANALYSIS 

This  section  provides  descriptions  of  potential  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operations 
impacts  on  the  Federally  threatened  bog  turtle  and  Federally  proposed  endangered  northern 
long-eared  bat.  Construction,  preconstruction,  and  operational  impacts  that  potentially  could 
affect  these  species  were  evaluated  based  on  habitat  presence  and  life  history  considerations 
as  well  as  the  type  and  spatial  and  temporal  nature  of  the  impacts.  The  primary  threats  to  the 
Federally  listed  bog  turtle  and  Federally  proposed  endangered  northern  long-eared  bat  from 
building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  include  habitat  reduction, 
fragmentation,  degradation,  and  the  potential  for  mortality  as  a  result  of  increased  vehicle  traffic 
and  collisions  with  site  structures. 

4.1  Habitat  Loss 

Construction  and  preconstruction  activities  proposed  for  the  PSEG  Site  will  impact  habitats 
(water  and  wetlands)  that  could  provide  potential  habitat  for  the  bog  turtle.  Although  the  project 
will  affect  approximately  94  percent  of  the  water  habitat  on  the  site,  over  93  percent  of  that  total 
consists  of  artificial  lakes  that  would  not  be  expected  to  provide  adequate  habitat  for  the  bog 
turtle.  Furthermore,  the  majority  of  the  wetland  habitat  to  be  disturbed  or  lost  consists  of 
monocultures  of  the  nonnative  invasive  common  reed  ( Phragmites  australis).  Such 
monocultures  do  not  provide  the  important  microhabitats  required  to  sustain  bog  turtles.

Appendix  F 


Habitat  suitable  for  supporting  hibernacula  and  maternity  roost  for  the  northern  long-eared  bat 
does  not  exist  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Additionally,  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  provide  suitable  habitat 
for  foraging  northern  long-eared  bats.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  will  be 
no  effect  on  the  northern  long-eared  bat  as  a  result  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

4.2  Cooling  System  Impacts  on  Vegetation 

Potential  effects  on  the  bog  turtle  from  the  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  mainly  would 
be  associated  with  water  vapor  and  drift  from  the  cooling  tower  systems.  The  main  concern 
would  be  salt  drift  and  deposition  that  could  affect  vegetation  in  the  surrounding  area.  However, 
calculated  salt  deposition  rates  fall  within  rates  that  are  generally  not  damaging  to  plants. 
Furthermore,  most  plants  within  the  salt  drift  zone  for  the  PSEG  Site  have  medium  to  high 
salinity  tolerance.  The  review  team  has  determined  that  there  would  be  no  effect  to  bog  turtle  or 
northern  long-eared  bat  habitat  from  PSEG  Site  cooling  system  operations. 

4.3  Wildlife  Collisions  with  Plant  Structures 

There  has  been  documentation  of  bat  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  with  human-made 
structures.  However,  these  collisions  do  not  significantly  affect  bat  populations.  Additionally, 
the  PSEG  Site  does  not  contain  habitat  suitable  for  northern  long-eared  bat  hibernacula, 
maternity  roosts,  or  foraging.  Therefore,  bat  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  with  human-made 
structures  is  not  expected  to  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

4.4  Impacts  of  Increased  Vehicle  Traffic 

Vehicle  traffic  is  expected  to  increase  as  a  result  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Increased  traffic  associated  with  the  operations  of  the  new  nuclear 
power  plant  has  the  potential  to  increase  wildlife  roadkills  due  to  collisions  with  vehicles,  and 
this  is  known  to  be  a  mortality  factor  for  bog  turtles.  There  could  be  a  decline  of  bog  turtle 
populations  if  roadkill  rates  exceed  the  rates  of  reproduction.  However,  the  proposed  causeway 
would  be  built  on  piers  to  limit  impacts  to  wildlife  corridors,  and  the  bog  turtle  population  is  not 
expected  to  be  affected  by  increased  traffic  on  the  PSEG  Site  or  vicinity. 

4.5  Transmission  Lines 

The  operation  and  maintenance  of  onsite  transmission  lines  are  not  expect  to  affect  the  bog 
turtle  or  northern-long  eared  bat.  Transmission  lines  on  the  PSEG  site  would  disturb  some  of 
the  coastal  wetland  areas.  Maintenance  of  transmission  lines  in  this  area  would  not  require 
disturbing  the  natural  vegetation  that  would  grow  under  the  lines.  There  is  a  potential  for 
transmission  lines  to  cause  bat  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  with  the  lines.  However,  habitat 
for  the  northern  long-eared  bat  does  not  exist  on  the  site,  and  collisions  in  the  vicinity  would  not 
be  expected  to  occur  in  rates  that  would  result  in  the  decline  of  migrating  bats.  Therefore, 
transmission  lines  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  be  expected  to  affect  bog  turtles  or  northern 
long-eared  bats.

5.0  CUMULATIVE  EFFECTS  ANALYSIS 

In  addition  to  impacts  from  construction,  preconstruction,  and  operation,  the  following 
cumulative  analysis  also  considers  other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future 
projects  that  could  affect  the  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecological  resources  also  affected  by 
building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Direct  and  indirect  impacts 
to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  resulting  from  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  limited  to  Salem  County, 
New  Jersey.  However,  the  cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  when 
combined  with  other  actions  would  extend  to  areas  within  the  Middle  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains, 
Northern  Piedmont,  and  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens  ecoregions.  For  purposes  of  this 
cumulative  analysis,  the  geographic  area  of  interest  for  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  is 
defined  as  the  Middle  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains,  Northern  Piedmont,  and  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine 
Barrens  Level  III  ecoregions  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site.  This  geographic  region  of  interest 
includes  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  and  other  counties,  or  portions  of  counties,  in  New  Jersey, 
Delaware,  Pennsylvania,  and  Maryland. 

5.1  Habitat  Loss 

The  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest  consist  of  the  Middle  Atlantic 
Coastal  Plain,  Northern  Piedmont,  and  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens.  The  Middle  Atlantic 
Coastal  Plain  is  characterized  as  nearly  flat  topography  and  consists  of  swampy,  marshy,  and 
frequently  flooded  areas.  Upland  areas  are  dominated  by  loblolly-shortleaf  pine  forests  and 
lowland,  and  tidally  influenced  areas  support  tidal  marshes,  swamps,  floodplain  forests,  and 
pocosins.  Marshes  are  dominated  by  cord  grass  and  salt-meadow  grass.  The  Northern 
Piedmont  is  characterized  by  irregular  plains  and  low  hills.  It  is  dominated  by  mixed  oak, 
chestnut  oak,  hemlock-mixed  hardwood,  and  sugar  maple-mixed  hardwood  forests.  The 
Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens  are  low  undulating  part  of  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain.  Native 
habitat  in  this  area  consists  of  pine-oak  woodlands,  mixed  oak  and  beech-oak  forests,  salt 
marshes,  swamps,  freshwater  marshes,  and  floodplains  (Woods  et  al.  2007-TN3227). 

The  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  ecoregion  has  been  altered  significantly  since  the  beginning  of 
European  settlement  in  the  1600s  as  a  result  of  agriculture,  silviculture,  and  urban  development. 
The  geographic  region  of  interest  includes  the  same  habitat  types  as  those  found  in  the  6-mi 
vicinity  of  the  site.  Habitats  within  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  include  barren  land, 
developed  land,  cultivated  cropland,  pasture  hay,  deciduous  forest,  evergreen  forest,  mixed 
forest,  emergent  herbaceous  wetland,  woody  wetland,  and  open  water.  However,  the  overall 
percentages  of  each  habitat  differ  when  expanding  from  the  6-mi  vicinity  to  encompass  the 
geographic  region  of  interest.  Open  water  associated  with  the  Delaware  River,  Delaware  Bay, 
and  other  open  water  areas  occupies  791 ,821  ac  (1 5.7  percent)  of  the  area.  Emergent 
herbaceous  wetland  occupies  199,603  ac  (4.0  percent),  and  woody  wetland  occupies 
279,248  ac  (5.5  percent).  Agricultural  land  consisting  of  cultivated  cropland  (1,075,101  ac)  and 
pasture  hay  (774,432  ac)  account  for  36.8  percent  of  the  land  cover.  Deciduous  forest  occupies 
1 ,028,552  ac  (20.5  percent)  of  the  habitat  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest. 

Developed  lands,  which  include  high,  medium,  low,  and  open  space  developed  land,  occupy 
630,983  ac  (12.6  percent).  Barren  lands  account  for  54,142  ac  (1 .1  percent)  of  the  land  cover. 
Evergreen  and  mixed  forest  habitat  accounts  for  190,352  ac  (3.8  percent)  of  land  cover  in  the 
geographic  region  of  interest  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).

The  USACE  created  Artificial  Island  in  the  early  1900s  with  the  authorization  of  the  Rivers  and 
Harbor  Act  of  1896.  The  act  authorized  the  creation  of  a  30  ft  channel  from  Philadelphia  to 
Delaware  Bay  and  covered  56  miles  of  proposed  channel.  The  amount  of  material  to  be 
removed  was  estimated  at  34,953,000  yd3  of  dredge  material  and  24,000  yd3  of  rock.  Six 
locations,  including  Baker  Shoal  and  Stony  Point  Shoal,  were  evaluated  as  potential  disposal 
sites.  Baker  Shoal  and  Stony  Point  Shoal  were  enclosed  in  1900  by  bulkheads  to  form  a 
deposit  basin  now  known  as  Artificial  Island  (Snyder  and  Guss  1974-TN2280).  Since  the 
development  of  Artificial  Island,  several  dredging  projects  have  been  conducted  that  have 
altered  the  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecology  of  the  region. 

Currently,  the  USACE  is  in  the  process  of  deepening  the  existing  Delaware  River  Federal 
Navigation  Channel  from  40  to  45  ft  from  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  and  Camden,  New 
Jersey,  to  the  mouth  of  the  Delaware  River  (USACE  2013-TN2665).  The  cumulative  impact 
contribution  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  associated  with  the  acquisition  by  PSEG  of  the 
85  ac  CDF  on  Artificial  Island  will  be  dependent  on  potential  need  for  the  USACE  to  develop  a 
new  CDF  and  could  add  to  the  overall  cumulative  impacts  for  the  geographic  region  of  interest. 
PSEG  is  in  the  process  of  obtaining  a  separate  land  exchange  agreement  with  the  USACE, 
Philadelphia  District,  for  the  Artificial  Island  CDF.  Any  land  exchange  agreement  between  the 
USACE  and  PSEG  would  undergo  a  separate  NEPA  review  and  would  require  PSEG  to  provide 
an  alternative  CDF  for  USACE-dredged  material  disposal  operations  currently  available  at  the 
Artificial  Island  CDF.  The  current  CDF  on  Artificial  Island  contains  low  quality  terrestrial  and 
wetland  habitat,  and  the  addition  of  a  new  CDF  has  the  potential  of  affecting  habitat  of  higher 
quality.  The  USACE’s  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project  would  require  a  site  to 
dispose  of  dredge  material.  The  USACE  proposes  to  dispose  of  dredge  material  at  Fort  Mifflin 
CDF.  The  USACE  determined  that  the  planned  impacts  are  consistent  with  previous  actions 
and  would  not  result  in  significant  impacts  to  the  affected  environment  (USACE  2013-TN2665). 
Similarly,  current  operations  of  SGS  and  HCGS  would  require  a  new  location  for  disposing  of 
dredge  material,  and  a  disposal  site  would  be  needed  for  dredge  material  from  the  barge  access 
area  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  effects  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  are  expected  to  be  less 
than,  but  consistent  with,  those  of  the  Delaware  River  Main  Channel  Deepening  Project. 
Consequently,  the  review  team  determined  that  the  cumulative  impact  on  terrestrial  and  wetland 
ecology  habitats  from  dredging  activities  as  a  result  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  in  conjunction  with  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable 
future  dredging  activities,  is  minimal. 

Most  of  the  other  operational  projects  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest  have  resulted  in  the 
reduction,  fragmentation,  and  degradation  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  in  the  geographical 
region  of  interest.  These  projects  include  several  fossil  fuel  energy  facilities  such  as  Delaware 
City  Refinery,  Deepwater  Energy  Center,  Carneys  Point  Generating  Plant,  Pedricktown 
Combined  Cycle  Cogeneration  Plant,  Cumberland  County  Landfill  Gas-to-Energy  Plant, 
Vineland  Municipal  Electric  Utility,  Sherman  Ave.  Energy  Center,  Carl’s  Corner  Energy  Center, 
and  Cumberland  Generating  Station.  Additionally,  there  are  four  operating  nuclear  power  plants 
located  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest  that  have  contributed  to  adverse  cumulative  effects 
to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources:  HGS,  SGS,  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station,  and 
Limerick  Generating  Station.  The  Salem  County  Solid  Waste  Landfill  also  operates  in  this 
region.  These  facilities  are  expected  to  have  continuing  effects  on  terrestrial  and  wetland

resources  in  the  region  of  interest  during  the  operational  period  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site. 

Future  residential  development  and  further  urbanization  of  the  area  would  result  in  the 
continued  increase  in  fragmentation  and  loss  of  habitat.  The  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor 
and  Workforce  Development  projected  that  the  population  of  Salem  County  would  increase  by 
approximately  5  percent  between  2010  and  2030.  The  overall  growth  of  the  geographic  region 
of  interest  is  expected  to  increase  as  well  from  2010  and  2030  (NJLWD  2014-TN3332).  Future 
urbanization  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest  could  result  in  further  losses  of  agricultural 
lands,  wetlands,  and  forested  areas.  Urbanization  would  reduce  area  in  natural  vegetation  and 
open  space  and  would  decrease  connectivity  among  wetlands,  forests,  and  other  wildlife 
habitat.  The  loss  of  habitats  as  a  result  of  urbanization  would  result  in  added  pressures  to  the 
remaining  habitat  available  for  wildlife  populations.  However,  it  is  not  expected  that  these 
activities  would  substantially  affect  the  overall  availability  of  wildlife  habitat  or  travel  corridors 
near  the  geographic  region  of  interest. 

Some  of  the  projects  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest  include  site  redevelopment,  including 
redevelopment  resulting  from  a  base  realignment  and  closure  for  Camp  Pedricktown, 

Shieldalloy  site  decommissioning,  Gateway  Business  Park,  and  the  Millville  Municipal  Airport. 
The  Camp  Pedricktown  redevelopment  and  Shieldalloy  facility  are  currently  developed/disturbed 
sites.  In  addition,  the  Gateway  Business  Park  in  Oldmans  Township,  Salem  County,  is  a  light 
industrial  complex  consisting  of  284  ac.  The  business  park  is  planning  to  develop  three  sites 
with  approximately  25  ac.  The  site  is  mostly  developed  with  little  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat 
available  (Matrix  Development  Group  2008-TN3273).  The  proposed  Millville  Municipal  Airport 
improvements  would  refurbish  the  apron  terminal  at  the  airport.  These  projects  are  not 
expected  to  further  degrade  or  fragment  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecology  resources  within  the 
geographic  region  of  interest. 

The  transmission  service  provider  has  determined  that  a  new  transmission  line  and  ROW  are 
needed  to  support  grid  stability  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest.  The  new  transmission  line 
and  ROW  are  not  dependent  on  whether  PSEG  builds  and  operates  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
on  the  PSEG  Site.  In  its  environmental  report,  PSEG  conducted  a  study  of  a  hypothetical  5-mi 
wide  macro-corridor  known  as  the  West  Macro-Corridor  and  transmission  line  ROW  that 
extends  55  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site  to  Peach  Bottom  Substation  in  Pennsylvania.  The 
transmission  line  ROW  within  the  corridor  is  expected  to  be  200  ft  wide.  The  development  of 
the  transmission  line  corridor  would  cause  disturbances  to  over  1 ,500  ac  of  land.  Habitats  that 
could  be  affected  include  barren  land,  deciduous  forests,  evergreen  forests,  mixed  forest, 
agricultural  land,  woody  wetlands,  and  emergent  wetlands  (PSEG  2014-TN3452).  The  corridor 
would  be  expected  to  follow  existing  ROWs  to  the  extent  practicable.  However,  the  exact 
amounts  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  that  would  be  affected  are  not  known,  and  it  is 
expected  that  the  project  would  cause  fragmentation  and  degradation  of  these  resources.  The 
amount  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  affected  by  the  grid  stability  line  would  not  be  a 
significant  amount  of  the  available  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  in  the  region,  but  mitigation 
may  be  required. 

Parks  and  wildlife  management  areas  located  in  the  region  of  interest  include  Supawna 
Meadows  National  Wildlife  Refuge,  Fort  Mott  State  Park,  Parvin  State  Park,  and  Mad  Horse

Creek  WMA.  These  areas  would  not  be  expected  to  add  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  and  may  be  affected  by  regional  development.  Habitats  available  in  this 
region  potentially  could  become  overburdened  with  species  fleeing  areas  being  developed.  The 
Supawna  Meadows  National  Wildlife  Refuge  35  miles  south  of  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  in 
Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  is  recognized  as  a  wetlands  of  international  importance 
(FWS  2013-TN2530).  The  refuge  covers  approximately  3,000  ac  and  is  an  important  refuge  for 
migratory  birds.  Fort  Mott  State  Park  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  is  a  124-ac  facility  and  was 
part  of  the  coastal  defense  system  for  the  Delaware  River  (NJDEP  2013-TN2532).  It  provides 
open  field  and  shoreline  habitats  as  well  as  recreational  activities  such  as  fishing.  Parvin  State 
Park  is  a  2,092-ac  facility  on  the  edge  of  the  Pine  Barrens  and  contains  coniferous  and 
deciduous  forest,  open  water,  and  wetland  habitats  (NJDEP  2013-TN2531 ).  Parvin  State  Park 
allows  fishing,  hunting,  and  other  recreational  activities.  The  proposed  Mad  Horse  Creek 
project  will  restore  nearly  200  ac  of  the  WMA  to  address  injuries  to  the  shoreline  and  bird 
resources  resulting  from  the  2004  Athos  I  oil  spill.  NJDEP  and  the  National  Oceanic  and 
Atmospheric  Administration  are  proposing  a  tidal  wetlands  restoration  project  that  allows  for  the 
restoration  of  Spartina  alterniflora  habitat  (NOAA  2008-TN2721 ).  Any  unavoidable  impacts  to 
wetlands  resulting  from  the  construction  of  the  new  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  could  be 
further  mitigated  by  this  restoration  project.  Sensitive  wildlife  species  that  use  marsh  habitats 
(e.g.,  bald  eagle  [Haliaeetus  leucocephalus ]  for  foraging,  northern  harrier  [Circus  cyaneus], 
osprey  [Pandion  haliaetus])  will  be  positively  affected  by  this  restoration  effort.  These  activities 
also  potentially  could  improve  habitat  for  the  bog  turtle. 

5.2  Salt  Drift,  Icing,  Fogging,  and  Increased  Precipitation 

Limerick  Generating  Station,  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station,  and  HCGS  use  cooling 
towers  as  part  of  their  cooling  system.  These  cooling  systems  have  the  potential  to  affect 
terrestrial  or  wetland  resources  in  the  region  as  a  result  of  salt  drift,  icing,  fogging,  and 
increased  precipitation  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  uses  MDCT, 
and  both  the  Limerick  Generating  Station  and  HCGS  use  NDCT.  Salt  drift  deposition  rates  are 
highest  with  MDCT  but  are  dispersed  further  with  NDCT.  However,  most  of  the  effects  of  salt 
deposition  on  vegetation  would  be  localized  to  the  towers.  No  adverse  impacts  to  terrestrial  or 
wetland  resources  from  fogging,  icing,  and  increased  precipitation  would  be  expected  as  a 
result  of  operating  cooling  systems.  The  effects  of  salt  drift,  icing,  fogging,  and  increased 
precipitation  from  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  were  evaluated  and 
found  to  have  a  negligible  effect  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources. 

5.3  Climate  Change 

The  "Global  Climate  Change  Impacts  in  the  United  States”  report,  provided  by  the  U.S.  Global 
Change  Research  Program  (GCRP),  summarizes  the  projected  impacts  of  future  climate 
changes  in  the  United  States.  The  report  divides  the  United  States  into  nine  regions,  with  the 
PSEG  Site  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The  GCRP  climate  models  for  this  region  project 
temperatures  to  rise  2.5  to  4°F  in  the  winter  and  1 .5  to  3.5°F  in  the  summer  over  the  next 
several  decades.  Winters  are  projected  to  be  much  shorter  with  fewer  cold  days  and  more 
precipitation.  Cities  that  currently  experience  few  days  above  100°F  each  summer  would 
average  20  or  more  days.  Hot  summer  conditions  would  come  three  weeks  earlier  and  last 
three  additional  weeks  into  the  fall.  Sea  level  is  projected  to  rise  more  than  the  global  average,

F. 3. 3-35 


NUREG-2168 


F-281 


Appendix  F 


with  more  frequent  severe  flooding  and  heavy  downpours.  These  projected  changes  potentially 
could  alter  wildlife  habitat  and  the  composition  of  wildlife  populations.  Large-scale  shifts  in  the 
ranges  of  wildlife  species  and  the  timing  of  seasons  and  animal  migration  that  are  already 
occurring  are  very  likely  to  continue  (GCRP  2014-TN3472). 

5.4  Summary  of  Cumulative  Impacts 

The  potential  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from  the  construction  and 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site,  in  combination  with  the  other  activities 
described  above,  would  noticeably  alter  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  These  activities  will 
result  in  the  loss  or  modification  of  terrestrial  habitats  and  wetlands,  which  potentially  could 
affect  important  species  that  live  or  migrate  through  the  area.  Therefore,  the  incremental 
contribution  of  the  building  and  operation  of  the  new  nuclear  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  to 
cumulative  impacts  would  be  noticeable. 

Although  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  contain  suitable  habitat  for  the  Federally  threatened 
(State-listed)  bog  turtle  and  the  Federally  proposed  endangered  northern  long-eared  bat, 
potential  offsite  transmission  lines  along  with  other  actions  taken  in  the  geographical  area  of 
interest  could  result  in  potential  impacts  to  this  species. 

The  extent  of  potential  cumulative  impacts  on  the  bog  turtle  and  northern  long-eared  bat  would 
be  dependent  upon  the  extent  of  BMPs  taken  with  the  implementation  of  the  various  projects  in 
the  geographical  area  of  interest.  Mitigation  or  avoidance  of  sensitive  habitat  would  be  an 
important  factor  in  determining  the  extent  of  potential  impacts. 

The  proposed  new  transmission  lines  to  support  grid  stability  have  the  potential  to  cross 
approximately  560  ac  of  freshwater  woody  and  emergent  wetlands  (PSEG  2014-TN3452). 

The  addition  of  the  new  transmission  corridor  potentially  could  cross  over  14  miles  of  streams. 
Additionally,  future  urbanization  could  result  in  some  limited  losses  of  wetlands  and  streams. 
State  and/or  Federal  regulations  would  protect  wetlands  and  streams  from  future  ROW 
development  and  urbanization.  However,  the  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from 
these  activities  and  a  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  be  noticeable. 

Potential  cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  for  the  site  vicinity  would 
result  from  loss  of  vegetation  as  well  as  loss  and  fragmentation  of  wildlife  habitat.  Such  effects 
will  increase  with  the  continued  development  of  the  geographical  area  of  interest,  with  potential 
impacts  to  bog  turtle  and  northern  long-eared  bat  habitat.  Overall,  when  combined  with  other 
past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions,  the  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial 
and  wetland  resources  resulting  from  the  building  and  operation  of  the  new  plant  on  the  PSEG 
Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  noticeable  but  would  not  be  expected  to  cause 
significant  overall  wildlife  species  population  or  ecosystem  impacts  within  the  6-mi  vicinity. 
Because  of  the  presence  of  extensive  similar  habitat  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest, 
potential  cumulative  impacts  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  within  this  region  would  be 
expected  to  be  minimal.

6.0  CONCLUSIONS  AND  DETERMINATION  OF  EFFECTS 

Construction  and  preconstruction  activities  proposed  for  the  PSEG  Site  will  affect  habitats 
(water  and  wetlands)  that  could  provide  potential  habitat  for  the  bog  turtle.  Although  the  project 
will  impact  approximately  94  percent  of  the  water  habitat  on  the  site,  over  93  percent  of  that  total 
consists  of  artificial  lakes  that  would  not  be  expected  to  provide  adequate  habitat  for  the  bog 
turtle.  Furthermore,  the  majority  of  the  wetland  habitat  to  be  disturbed  or  lost  consists  of 
monocultures  of  the  nonnative  invasive  common  reed.  Such  monocultures  do  not  provide  the 
important  microhabitats  required  to  sustain  bog  turtles.  Hibernacula.  maternity  roost,  and 
foraging  habitat  for  the  northern  long-eared  bat  do  not  exist  on  the  PSEG  Site,  and  building 
activities  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  have  no  effect  on  this  species.  In 
addition,  PSEG  is  developing  a  wetland  mitigation  plan  to  compensate  for  the  loss  of  wetlands 
and  other  aquatic  resources  resulting  from  the  proposed  project.  This  plan  would  require 
approval  through  the  Department  of  the  Army  permit  application  submitted  to  the  USACE. 
Philadelphia  District. 

Potential  impacts  to  the  bog  turtle  from  the  operation  of  the  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be 
associated  mainly  with  water  vapor  and  drift  from  the  cooling  tower  systems.  The  main  concern 
would  be  salt  drift  and  deposition  that  could  potentially  affect  vegetation  in  the  surrounding  area. 
However,  calculated  salt  deposition  rates  fall  within  rates  that  are  not  generally  damaging  to 
plants.  Furthermore,  most  plants  within  the  salt  drift  zone  for  the  PSEG  Site  have  medium  to 
high  salinity  tolerance.  Increased  traffic  associated  with  the  operations  of  the  new  nuclear 
power  plant  has  the  potential  to  increase  wildlife  road  kills  due  to  collisions  with  vehicles,  and 
this  is  known  to  be  a  mortality  factor  for  bog  turtles. 

Potential  impacts  to  the  northern  long-eared  bat  from  operation  of  the  new  nuclear  power 
plant  would  be  associated  mainly  with  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  with  human-made 
structures  on  the  site.  However,  bat  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  is  not  known  to  affect 
overall  bat  populations.  Additionally,  northern-long-eared  bats  are  not  known  to  occur  on  the 
PSEG  Site  and  suitable  habitat  does  not  exist  on  the  site. 

The  PSEG  Site  does  not  appear  to  provide  suitable  habitat  requirements  to  sustain  the  bog 
turtle  or  the  northern  long-eared  bat.  Therefore,  habitat  disturbed  or  lost  because  of  the 
construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  should  not  affect  these  species. 
Furthermore,  there  are  no  recent  records  for  the  bog  turtle  on  the  PSEG  Site.  FWS  previously 
indicated  that  this  species  is  not  known  to  occur  on  or  in  the  vicinity  of  the  HCGS  and  SGS 
sites,  and  recent  feedback  from  the  FWS  stated  that  the  activities  proposed  for  the  site  would 
not  likely  affect  Federally  listed  species.  Therefore,  the  review  team  has  determined  that 
building  and  operation  activities  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site 
would  have  no  adverse  effects  on  the  Federally  threatened  bog  turtle  or  Federally  proposed 
endangered  northern  long-eared  bat.

Permit  for  the  PSEG  Site 


1.0  INTRODUCTION 

The  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  review  team  is  reviewing  an  application 
submitted  by  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  for  an  early  site  permit 
(ESP)  for  a  site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  Generating  Station  (HCGS)  and 
Salem  Generating  Station,  Units  1  and  2  (SGS),  on  the  eastern  shore  of  the  Delaware  River 
Estuary  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek  Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  As  part  of  its  review  of 
this  ESP  application,  the  NRC  is  preparing  an  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  as  required 
by  Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (10  CFR)  Part  51  (10  CFR  Part  51-TN250),  the 
NRC  regulations  that  implement  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969,  as  amended 
(NEPA)  (42  USC  4321  et  seq.  -TN661 ).  The  EIS  will  include  an  analysis  of  pertinent 
environmental  issues,  including  endangered  and  threatened  species  and  impacts  to  fish  and 
wildlife.  The  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE),  Philadelphia  District,  is  a  cooperating 
agency  on  the  EIS. 

An  ESP  is  a  commission  approval  of  a  site  for  one  or  more  nuclear  power  facilities.  Issuance  of 
an  ESP  is  a  process  that  is  separate  from  the  issuance  of  a  construction  permit  (CP),  an 
operating  license  (OL),  or  a  combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (COL)  for  such 
a  facility.  The  ESP  application  and  review  process  makes  it  possible  to  evaluate  and  resolve 
safety  and  environmental  issues  related  to  siting  before  the  applicant  makes  a  large 
commitment  of  resources.  If  the  ESP  is  approved,  the  applicant  can  “bank”  the  site  for  up  to 
20  years  for  future  reactor  siting  but  may  not  conduct  activities  defined  as  “construction”  in  10 
CFR  50.10(a)(2)  (TN249)  without  receiving  further  authorization.  An  ESP  does  not  authorize 
construction  activities  or  operation  of  a  nuclear  power  plant.  To  construct  and  operate  a  nuclear 
power  plant,  an  ESP  holder  must  obtain  a  CP  and  an  OL,  or  a  COL,  which  are  separate  major 
Federal  actions  that  require  their  own  environmental  reviews  in  accordance  with  10  CFR  Part  51 
(TN250).  For  a  COL  or  CP  application  that  references  an  ESP,  the  NRC  staff,  pursuant  to 
1 0  CFR  51 .75(c)(1)  (TN250),  would  prepare  a  supplement  to  the  ESP  EIS  in  accordance  with 
10  CFR  51 .92(e)  (TN250)  and  would  engage  in  new  consultation  in  accordance  with  section 
7(c)  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1 973,  as  amended  (ESA)  (16  USC  1 531  et  seq.  - 
TN1010). 

By  letter  dated  October  26,  2010  (NRC  2010-TN2202),  the  NRC  initiated  ESA  (16  USC  1531  et 
seq.  -TNI 010)  Section  7  consultation  with  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (FWS)  and 
requested  a  list  of  endangered,  threatened,  candidate,  and  proposed  species  as  well  as 
designated  and  proposed  critical  habitat  that  may  be  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  NRC 
received  an  e-mail  response  (dated  March  20,  2013)  from  Steve  Mars,  senior  biologist  at  the 
FWS  New  Jersey  Field  office,  which  stated,  “The  activities  you  [NRC]  describe  will  not  likely 
affect  a  federal  listed  species  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  USFWS”  (FWS  201 3-TN3364).  In  a 
letter  to  FWS  dated  December  13,  2013,  the  NRC  requested  an  update  on  Federally  listed, 
proposed,  and  candidate  species  as  well  as  designated  and  proposed  critical  habitat  that  may

be  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  any  updates  to  the  initial  information  to  assist  with  the 
preparation  of  the  ESA  biological  assessment  (BA)  and  EIS  for  the  project  (NRC  2013-TN3363). 
A  response  was  not  received  before  the  NRC  submitted  a  request  for  comments  on  the  draft 
environmental  impact  statement  (NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN4279)  and  BA  (NRC  and  USACE 
2014-TN4313)  to  USFWS  on  August  28,  2014  (NRC  2014-TN4268).  The  U.S.  Department  of 
Interior  submitted  a  response  to  the  EIS  and  BA  on  November  5,  2014,  indicating  that  no 
additional  measures  were  required  (DOI  2014-TN4269). 

The  August  2014  BA  (NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN4313)  examined  the  potential  impacts  of 
construction  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  federally  listed  threatened  or 
endangered  species  and  species  that  were  proposed  Federal  endangered  species  on  the  PSEG 
Site  at  that  time.  The  August  2014  BA  concluded  that  construction  and  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant,  including  activities  that  would  be  authorized  under  a  Department  of  the 
Army  permit,  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  affect  terrestrial  species  then  listed  under  the  ESA, 
including  then  proposed  Federally  endangered  species  (NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN431 3). 

Since  publication  of  the  BA  (NRC  and  USACE  2014-TN4313)  and  the  draft  EIS  (NRC  and 
USACE  2014-TN4279),  the  rufa  red  knot  ( Calidris  canutus  rufa,  hereafter  referred  to  as  “rufa 
red  knot”)  was  listed  as  threatened  on  January  12,  2015,  pursuant  to  ESA  Section  7(c)  (79 
Federal  Register  [FR]  73705-TN4267).  Additionally,  the  northern  long-eared  bat  ( Myotis 
septentrionalis ,  hereafter  reffered  to  as  “northern  long-eared  bat)  was  updated  to  Federally 
listed  as  threatened  on  May  4,  2015  (80  FR  17974-TN4216).  The  NRC,  in  cooperation  with  the 
USACE,  has  prepared  this  supplemental  BA  to  support  a  joint  consultation  with  FWS  in 
accordance  with  the  ESA  (16  USC  1531  et  seq.  -TN1010).  Because  NRC  and  the  USACE  are 
cooperating  on  this  BA,  the  analysis  that  follows  does  not  distinguish  between  NRC-authorized 
construction  activities  and  other  building  activities;  they  are  analyzed  together  as  “building” 
activities.  This  supplemental  BA  examines  the  potential  impacts  on  the  rufa  red  knot  and 
northern  long-eared  bat  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site,  including  activities  that  would  be  authorized  under  a  Department  of  the  Army  permit, 
adjacent  to  SGS  and  HCGS. 

2.0  DESCRIPTION  OF  PROPOSED  ACTIONS 

PSEG  is  seeking  an  ESP  for  site  approval  for  a  potential  future  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  a 
site  (the  PSEG  Site)  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  HCGS  and  SGS  and  a  Department  of  the 
Army  permit  to  perform  certain  site-preparation  activities.  Building  activities  that  could  affect 
onsite  and  offsite  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecosystems  include  site  preparation  for  installation  of 
the  power  block,  cooling  tower,  concrete  batch  plant,  intake  structure,  switchyard,  offices  and 
warehouses,  heavy  haul  road,  temporary  laydown  areas,  parking  areas,  and  a  proposed 
causeway  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

2.1  Location  and  Description 

2.1.1  Site 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  on  the  southern  part  of  Artificial  Island  in  Lower  Alloways  Creek 
Township,  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Artificial  Island  was  formed  from  dredge  spoils

Appendix  F 


produced  as  a  result  of  maintenance  dredging  of  the  Delaware  River  navigation  channel  by  the 
USACE.  The  site  is  approximately  7  mi  east  of  Middletown,  Delaware;  7.5  mi  southwest  of 
Salem,  New  Jersey;  and  9  mi  south  of  Pennsville,  New  Jersey  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Figure  1 
shows  the  location  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  the  areas  within  a  6-mi  (10-km)  radius  and  a  50-mi 
(80-km)  radius  of  the  facility. 

The  PSEG  Site  is  located  adjacent  to  HCGS  and  SGS  on  the  northwestern  portion  of  the 
existing  PSEG  property.  Figure  2  depicts  the  proposed  PSEG  Site  in  relation  to  the  existing 
units  and  nearby  water  bodies.  PSEG  owns  734  ac  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  is  developing  an 
agreement  with  the  USACE  to  acquire  85  ac  immediately  north  of  the  site.  Thus,  the  total 
proposed  PSEG  Site  would  encompass  819  ac  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Figure  3  provides  an 
aerial  view  of  the  proposed  site  layout  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  area  within  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  site  contains  mainly  water  (Delaware  River  and  Bay), 
agricultural  lands,  wetlands,  and  some  forestland.  The  area  also  includes  numerous  parks, 
wildlife  refuges,  and  preserves  such  as  Mad  Horse  Creek  Wildlife  Management  Area  (WMA)  to 
the  east  and  Abbotts  Meadows  WMA  to  the  north  in  New  Jersey,  and  Cedar  Swamp  WMA  to 
the  south  and  Augustine  WMA  to  the  west  in  Delaware  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Appendix  F 


Vegetation  communities  were  identified  from  New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental 
Protection  (NJDEP)  land  use  and  land  cover  (LULC)  data  for  the  PSEG  Site  and  offsite  areas 
that  potentially  would  be  affected  by  the  proposed  causeway.  Six  vegetative  cover  types  were 
identified  and  include:  urban  or  built-up  land,  forestland,  water,  wetlands,  barren  land,  and 
managed  wetlands.  The  listed  coverage  types  are  common  within  the  Outer  Coastal  Plain 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Table  1  lists  NJDEP  2002  LULC  within  the  proposed  PSEG  Site. 

2.1.2  Urban  or  Built-up  Lands  (Developed  Land) 

Land  use  in  the  urban  or  built-up  land  category  is  characterized  as  having  been  altered  by 
human  activities  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  The  majority  of  these  lands  on  the  site  are  related  to 
power  generation  of  HCGS  and  SGS  and  associated  structures.  The  urban  or  built-up  coverage 
type  accounts  for  358  ac,  or  44  percent,  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Upland  rights-of-way  (ROWs) 
(undeveloped)  support  shrubby  vegetation  but  are  considered  under  the  urban  or  built-up  land 
category  as  a  result  of  vegetation  maintenance  practices  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Also  included 
in  this  category  are  two  wetland  subcategories,  wetland  ROWs  and  Phragmites-dominated 
urban  area.  Wetland  ROWs  are  included  in  this  category  because  they  exhibit  hydric  soils  but, 
as  a  result  of  alterations,  may  not  support  vegetation  typical  of  natural  wetlands  (NJDEP  2010- 
TN2887).  Wetland  ROWs  account  for  23.8  ac,  or  3  percent,  of  the  site,  and  Phragmites- 
dominated  urban  areas  account  for  0.5  ac,  or  less  than  1  percent,  of  the  site  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  This  type  of  land  use  provides  limited  habitat  for  wildlife  use. 

2.1.3  Wetlands 

The  wetlands  category  includes  those  areas  that  are  inundated  or  saturated  by  surface  or 
ground  waters  at  a  frequency  and  duration  sufficient  to  support,  and  that  under  normal 
circumstances  do  support,  a  prevalence  of  vegetation  typically  adapted  for  life  in  saturated  soil 
conditions.  This  category  does  not  include  wetlands  that  have  been  modified  for  recreation, 
agriculture,  or  industry;  these  are  described  under  specific  use  categories  (NJDEP  2010- 
TN2887).  The  wetland  category  accounts  for  284.9  ac,  or  approximately  35  percent,  of  the 
site’s  total  available  habitat  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Wetlands  influenced  by  the  tidal  portions  of 
the  Delaware  River  system  and  the  tidal  portions  of  the  watercourses  draining  into  the  Atlantic 
Ocean  are  categorized  as  coastal  wetlands  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Coastal  wetlands  found  on 
the  site  include  saline  marshes  and  Phragmites-d o m i n ated  coastal  wetlands.  Saltmarsh 
cordgrass  ( Spartina  alterniflora)  dominates  these  wetlands  in  areas  of  high  salinity.  Brackish 
marshes  are  co-dominated  by  big  cordgrass  ( Spartina  cynosuroides),  saltmarsh  cordgrass, 
common  reed  ( Phragmites  australis ),  narrowleaf  cattail  ( Typha  angustifolia),  and  common 
threesquare  {Schoenoplectus  pungens).  Salt  marshes  account  for  0.2  ac,  or  less  than  1 
percent,  of  the  site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Phragmites- dominated  coastal  wetlands  are  marsh 
areas  that  are  dominated  by  the  nonnative  invasive  Phragmites  australis  (NJDEP  2010- 
TN2887).  Phragmites- dominated  coastal  wetlands  are  the  most  common  wetland  type  found  on 
the  site  and  account  for  1 55.6  ac,  or  1 9  percent,  of  the  site’s  vegetation  cover  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).

Isolated  wetlands  and  wetlands  generally  found  in  non-tidal  lowlands  influenced  by  primary, 
secondary,  and  tertiary  courses  and  are  categorized  as  interior  wetlands  (NJDEP  2010- 
TN2887).  Interior  wetlands  found  on  the  site  include  deciduous  scrub/shrub  wetlands, 
herbaceous  wetlands,  and  Phragmites- dominated  interior  wetlands.  There  are  4.6  ac  of 
deciduous  scrub/shrub  wetlands  representing  less  than  1  percent  of  the  total  acreage  available 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Herbaceous  wetlands  are  characterized  as  being  dominated  by 
herbaceous  species  associated  with  lake  edges,  open  flood  plains,  and  abandoned  wetlands 
agricultural  fields  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Herbaceous  wetlands  account  for  5.8  ac,  or  less  than 
1  percent,  of  the  total  acreage  at  the  PSEG  Site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Phragmites-domlnated 
interior  wetlands  are  dominated  by  the  Phragmites  australis  and  account  for  1 18.7  ac,  or  14.5 
percent,  of  the  site’s  acreage. 

2.1.4  Forestland 

Old  field  (<25%  brush  covered),  Phragmites-6om\naied  old  field  and  deciduous  brush/shrubland 
identified  by  NJDEP  as  occurring  on  the  site  are  categorized  under  forested  land, 
brushland/shrubland.  Vegetation  cover  could  include  early  successional  species  to  climax 
species  and  are  between  0  and  20  ft  in  height.  Old  field  is  also  covered  in  this  category  and  can 
contain  shrubs  and  grasses  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Forested  land  covers  over  107.3  ac,  or 
approximately  13  percent,  of  the  site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Old  field  (<25%  brushed  covered)  is  predominantly  covered  by  grasses,  herbaceous  species, 
tree  seedlings,  and/or  saplings.  Phragmites-dominateb  old  field  contains  open  fields 
predominantly  covered  by  Phragmites  australis.  Natural  forested  areas  covered  predominantly 
with  deciduous  species  less  than  20  ft  in  height  are  classified  under  deciduous  brush/shrubland. 
This  category  also  can  include  agricultural  lands  that  have  been  overgrown  with  brush 
(NJDEP  2010-TN2887). 

Ten  walking  surveys  conducted  by  PSEG  in  2009  on  brushland/scrubland  areas  indicated  that 
the  most  common  vegetation  species  included  groundsel  tree/sea  myrtle  ( Baccharis  halimifolia), 
autumn  olive  ( Elaeagnus  umbellata),  multiflora  rose  ( Rosa  multiflora ),  Japanese  honeysuckle 
( Lonicera  japonica ),  poison  ivy  ( Toxicodendron  radicans ),  annual  ragweed  ( Ambrosia 
artemisiifolia ),  broomsedge  ( Andropogon  virginicus),  thyme-leaf  sandwort  ( Arenaria 
serpyllifolia ),  mugwort  ( Artemisia  vulgaris ),  Queen  Anne’s  lace  ( Daucus  carota ),  common  spike 
rush  ( Eleocharis  palustris),  late  boneset  ( Eupatorium  serotinum ),  fescue  ( Festuca  sp.),  Chinese 
lespedeza  ( Lespedeza  cuneata),  yellow  sweet  clover  ( Melilotus  officinalis),  blue  scorpion  grass 
( Myosotis  stricta),  common  reed,  plantain  ( Plantago  virginica),  Canada  bluegrass  ( Poa 
compressa ),  green  foxtail  ( Setaria  viridis ),  Canada  goldenrod  ( Solidaga  altissima),  goldenrod 
(Solidago  sp.),  and  purpletop  {Tridens  flavus)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2.1.5  Water 

The  NJDEP  LULC  category  of  water  includes  all  areas  within  the  landmass  of  New  Jersey 
periodically  covered  by  water  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  This  includes  the  artificial  lakes  and  tidal 
rivers,  inland  bays,  and  other  tidal  waters  found  on  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  Artificial  lakes 
include  water  bodies  that  are  1  ac  and  larger.  Water  control  structures  would  be  present  on 
these  sites.  Tidal  rivers,  inland  bays,  and  other  tidal  waters  include  tidal  portions  of 


NUREG-2168

watercourses,  enclosed  tidal  bays,  and  other  tidal  water  bodies.  Land  cover  categorized  as 
water  accounts  for  approximately  46  ac  or  5.6,  percent  of  the  site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

2.1.6  Barren  Lands 

Barren  lands  are  in  non-urban  settings  and  are  characterized  by  thin  soil,  sand,  or  rocks 
(NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  These  land  cover  types  are  often  lacking  vegetative  cover,  or  the 
vegetation  is  sparse.  The  NJDEP  LULC  data  indicates  that  two  subcategories  of  barren  lands, 
altered  lands  and  disturbed  wetlands,  are  present  at  the  site.  Altered  lands  are  non-urban  areas 
that  have  been  changed  by  human  activities.  Disturbed  wetlands  are  formal  natural  wetlands 
that  have  been  altered  by  clearing,  grading,  leveling,  filling,  and/or  excavating.  The  soils  are 
hydric  but  lack  vegetation  or  wetland  species.  Barren  lands  represent  19.1  ac,  or  2.3  percent, 
of  the  site’s  total  acreage  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2.1.7  Managed  Wetlands 

Managed  wetlands  are  characterized  by  hydric  soils  but  do  not  support  typical  wetland 
vegetation  (NJDEP  2010-TN2887).  Some  examples  are  stormwater  swales,  golf  fairways  and 
recreational  fields,  and  open  lawn  areas.  Managed  wetlands  account  for  3.8  ac,  or  less  than 
1  percent,  of  the  site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

2.1.8  Vicinity 

The  existing  access  road  and  the  proposed  causeway  are  included  as  part  of  the  vicinity.  The 
existing  access  road  extends  3.6  mi  east-northeast  from  the  PSEG  Site  to  Alloway  Creek  Neck 
Road  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  ROW  is  350  ft  wide  except  where  it  travels  through  state 
owned  lands,  where  it  is  450  ft  wide.  Vegetation  cover  types  in  the  existing  access  road  include 
134  ac  of  agricultural  land,  146  ac  of  wetlands,  50  ac  of  urban/built-up  land,  39  ac  of  barren 
land,  6  ac  of  forestland,  and  4  ac  of  open  water  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  total  area  covered 
by  the  existing  access  road  ROW  is  379  ac.  Dominant  species  noted  along  the  access  road 
include  common  reed  and  cordgrass  (PSEG  1982-TN2889).  In  additional  to  part  of  the  State  of 
New  Jersey,  portions  of  the  State  of  Delaware  and  the  Delaware  River  also  lie  within  the  6-mi 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  NJDEP  LULC  database  would  not  provide  vegetation  cover  for 
areas  outside  of  the  State  of  New  Jersey.  As  a  result,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  (USGS) 

LULC  database  was  used  to  determine  the  vegetation  communities  for  areas  within  the  6-mi 
vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site.  The  USGS  database  is  composed  of  nine  LULC  categories 
(Anderson  et  al.  1976-TN2888).  Six  of  these  categories  are  applicable  to  the  PSEG  vicinity: 
urban  or  built-up  land  (developed  land),  agricultural  land,  forestland,  water,  wetlands,  and 
barren  land  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Urban  or  built-up  land  accounts  for  939  ac,  or  1 .2  percent, 
of  the  available  land  use  in  the  vicinity.  Agricultural  land  includes  cultivated  crops  and  pasture. 
Approximately  17,097  ac  (23  percent)  of  the  available  vegetation  cover  in  the  vicinity  is 
agricultural. 

Forestland  in  the  vicinity  includes  deciduous,  evergreen,  and  mixed  forests  and  accounts  for 
approximately  2,653  ac,  or  less  than  4  percent,  of  the  available  vegetation  cover  in  the  vicinity. 
As  a  result  of  the  site’s  proximity  to  the  Delaware  River  and  Bay,  water  is  the  largest  available 
LULC  in  the  vicinity,  accounting  for  approximately  26,837  ac,  or  nearly  37  percent,  of  the

vicinity.  There  are  approximately  16,555  ac  of  emergent  herbaceous  wetlands  and  8,979  ac  of 
woody  wetlands  in  the  PSEG  Site  vicinity.  Together  the  wetlands  LULC  accounts  for  nearly 
35  percent,  making  it  the  second  largest  vegetation  cover  type  in  the  vicinity.  Barren  land 
makes  up  nearly  651  ac,  or  less  than  1  percent,  of  the  LULC  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

2.2  Impacts  to  Habitats 

Proposed  ground-disturbing  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  and  offsite  areas  are  based  on  the  Site 
Utilization  Plan  (Figure  3).  Permanent  land  impacts  are  depicted  as  cross  hatched,  and 
temporary  land  impacts  are  diagonal  hatched.  Potential  areas  affected  include  the  power  block, 
cooling  tower,  concrete  batch  plant,  intake  structure,  switchyard,  offices  and  warehouses,  heavy 
haul  road,  temporary  laydown  areas,  parking  areas,  and  the  proposed  causeway. 
Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  include  clearing,  grubbing,  and  grading  of  the  site; 
installing  erosion  control  measures;  building  access  and  haul  roads;  installing  construction 
security  infrastructure;  installing  temporary  utilities  and  facilities  (e.g.,  storage  warehouses, 
concrete  batch  plant);  preparing  the  laydown,  fabrication,  and  shop  areas;  relocating  existing 
facilities  within  the  PSEG  Site;  staging  equipment;  and  preparation  activities  associated  with 
power  plant  construction  support.  The  applicant  has  not  determined  the  type  of  reactor  to  be 
built  on  site  and  is  using  a  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE)  to  bound  associated  building 
impacts.  The  terrestrial  ecology  impacts  represented  in  this  section  are  based  on  the  PPE,  and 
the  actual  limits  of  disturbance  (particularly  wetlands  and  jurisdictional  streams)  may  be 
minimized  further  during  the  design  phase  after  a  specific  reactor  technology  is  selected.  PSEG 
anticipates  that  once  a  design  is  selected,  and  if  the  NRC  approves  a  CP  or  COL,  building 
activities  could  take  68  months  to  complete  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  result  in  the  permanent  or  temporary 
disturbance  of  approximately  385  ac  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  45  ac  of  adjacent  offsite  areas  (see 
Table  2),  as  well  as  69  ac  of  the  habitat  in  the  area  of  the  proposed  causeway.  The  45  ac 
offsite  area  is  currently  owned  by  the  USACE  and  is  used  as  a  combined  disposal  facility  (CDF) 
for  disposal  of  dredge  materials.  In  addition,  the  permitted  disposal  facility  on  the  PSEG  Site  is 
used  for  disposal  of  materials  dredged  from  the  intake  structures  of  HCGS  and  SGS. 
Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  that  would  affect  terrestrial  habitats  include  clearing 
and  grubbing,  site  grading  of  upland  areas,  excavation,  and  filling  of  various  site  areas  to 
achieve  design  grades  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  A  total  of  228.6  ac  of  the  affected  area  is 
considered  temporary.  This  includes  159.9  ac  on  the  site,  45.2  ac  on  adjacent  offsite  areas, 
and  land  disturbances  on  23.5  ac  during  building  of  the  proposed  causeway  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280). 

2.2.1  Urban  or  Built-up  Land  (Developed  Land) 

Approximately  91  ac,  or  approximately  26  percent,  of  urban  or  built-up  land  on  the  proposed 
PSEG  Site  would  be  used  during  building  activities.  Temporary  uses  would  account  for  almost 
45  ac.  Permanent  use  would  equal  to  approximately  47  ac,  or  approximately  13  percent,  of  the 
urban  or  built-up  land  use  on  the  site  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Offsite  effects  on  urban  or  built-up  land  also  occur  in  the  adjacent  offsite  areas  and  the 
proposed  causeway.  Building  activities  in  the  adjacent  offsite  areas  would  temporarily  make 
use  of  2.4  ac  of  urban  or  built-up  lands.  The  proposed  causeway  would  permanently  use  4.2  ac 
and  temporarily  use  1 .4  ac  of  developed  lands  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

A  total  of  271  ac  of  the  affected  terrestrial  habitat  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  would  be 
permanently  converted  to  developed  land  uses  containing  structures,  pavement,  or  other 
intensively  maintained  exterior  grounds.  There  are  approximately  939  ac  of  developed  land  in 
the  vicinity  and  630,983  ac  in  the  region.  The  proposed  action  would  add  an  additional 
22  percent  of  developed  land  uses  to  the  vicinity  and  make  use  of  approximately  5  percent  of 
developed  lands  available.  These  land  areas  have  limited  value  for  wildlife  on  the  site  or  in  the 
vicinity  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

2.2.2  Forestland 

The  forestland  cover  type  is  mainly  present  in  the  southeast  portion  of  the  PSEG  Site. 

Scattered  old  field  communities  consisting  of  one  or  more  land  cover  types  also  occur 
sporadically  in  the  north  and  west  portions  of  the  PSEG  Site.  Building  activities  would  disturb 
approximately  89  ac  of  the  available  forestland  on  the  site.  Permanent  use  would  result  in  the 
loss  of  8.7  ac  of  forestland,  and  80.3  ac  would  be  temporarily  disturbed.  The  permanent  change 
of  land  use  would  result  in  the  loss  of  approximately  8  percent  of  the  available  forestland  on  the 
site.  The  majority  of  the  forestland  on  the  site  to  be  permanently  lost  is  designated  as 
deciduous  brush/shrubland  habitat  (6  ac)  and  old  field  (<25  percent  brush  covered)  (2.6  ac) 
under  the  NJ  LULC  system  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Less  than  1  ac  of  forestland  would  be  disturbed  temporarily  and  3.5  ac  would  change 
permanently  with  building  the  proposed  causeway.  No  forestland  would  be  disturbed  in 
adjacent  offsite  areas  during  building  activities  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

There  is  approximately  2,653  ac  of  forestland  available  in  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site,  and 
the  proposed  building  activities  would  permanently  remove  less  than  1  percent  of  that  available 
habitat.  The  effects  on  forestland  from  building  activities  at  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  result  in  a 
noticeable  impact  to  forestland  in  the  vicinity  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2.2.3  Water 

The  proposed  building  activities  would  disturb  approximately  44  ac  of  water  habitats  on  the  site. 
Approximately  40  ac  of  artificial  lakes  and  nearly  3  ac  of  tidal  rivers,  inland  bays,  and  other  tidal 
waters  would  be  permanently  disturbed.  The  permanent  loss  represents  approximately  94 
percent  of  the  available  onsite  water  habitats.  Less  than  1  ac  would  be  temporarily  disturbed  on 
the  site  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Building  activities  on  offsite  adjacent  areas  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  disturb 
approximately  5  ac  of  available  water  habitat  in  these  areas.  Temporary  disturbances  include 
less  than  1  ac  in  adjacent  offsite  areas  and  approximately  2  ac  in  the  causeway.  Permanent 
losses  offsite  occur  only  in  the  proposed  causeway  area,  and  losses  would  be  approximately  2 
ac  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

There  are  approximately  26,837  ac  of  water  habitat  in  the  vicinity.  The  permanent  loss  of  this 
habitat  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity  represents  less  than  1  percent  of  the  total  available  habitat 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  The  loss  of  these  areas  would  not  have  a  noticeable  effect  on  the 
available  habitat  in  the  area. 

2.2.4  Wetlands 

Wetlands  and  other  aquatic  habitats  are  mainly  located  in  the  extreme  eastern  and  northern 
portions  of  the  PSEG  Site  and  represent  one  of  the  largest  available  habitats  on  the  site.  A 
potential  future  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  permanently  disturb  108  ac  of  wetlands, 
including  0.1  ac  of  saline  marsh,  58.3  ac  of  Phragmites-don\\na\ed  coastal  wetlands,  0.9  ac  of 
herbaceous  wetlands,  4.6  ac  of  deciduous  scrub/shrub  wetlands,  and  44.1  ac  of  Phragmites- 
dominated  interior  wetlands.  There  would  be  31 .8  ac  of  temporary  effects  on  the  site,  including 
5.1  ac  of  Phr agmites-d o m i n ate d  coastal  wetlands,  2.5  ac  of  herbaceous  wetlands,  and  24.2  ac 
of  Phragmites- dominated  interior  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Offsite  effects  on  wetlands  from  the  building  activities  in  the  offsite  adjacent  areas  and  the 
proposed  causeway  would  total  72.8  ac.  A  permanent  loss  of  23  ac  would  occur  in  the  wetlands 
associated  with  the  proposed  causeway,  including  losses  of  6.1  ac  of  freshwater  tidal  marsh, 

1 1 .2  ac  of  Phragmites-dom\na\ed  coastal  wetlands,  1 .2  ac  of  herbaceous  wetlands,  0.1  ac  of 
mixed  scrub/shrub  wetlands  (coniferous  dominated),  and  4.4  ac  of  Phragmites-domnated 
interior  wetlands.  A  total  of  49.8  ac  would  be  disturbed  temporarily,  including  6.6  ac  of 
freshwater  tidal  marshes,  13.2  ac  of  Phragmites-d o m i n ated  coastal  wetlands,  and  29.2  ac  of 
Phragmites-dominaied  interior  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Potential  effects  on  Wetland  plant  communities  may  consist  of  actual  direct  damage  to  plants, 
compaction  of  wetland  soils,  and  short-term  reductions  in  productivity.  The  proposed  causeway 
would  be  designed  as  an  elevated  structure  to  minimize  potential  effects  on  plant  communities. 
Permanent  effects  on  wetland  plant  communities  along  the  causeway  would  be  limited  to 
placement  of  piers  and  direct  shading.  Shading  potentially  could  result  in  some  alteration  of 
plant  community  makeup  under  the  causeway  and  a  reduction  in  primary  productivity.  The 
building  method  for  the  proposed  causeway  has  not  yet  been  determined,  but  construction  work 
mats  are  expected  to  be  used  within  a  50-ft  wide  easement.  Reductions  in  primary  productivity 
due  to  causeway  development  should  be  minimal  overall,  considering  the  large  area  of  adjacent 
coastal  wetlands  within  the  project  vicinity  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

A  total  of  1 31  ac  of  wetlands  would  be  lost  as  a  result  of  building  activities  on  the  PSEG  Site 
and  vicinity.  This  represents  less  than  1  percent  of  the  25,534  ac  of  wetlands  available  in  the 
vicinity  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Most  of  these  wetlands  are  dominated  by  near  monocultures  of 
the  common  reed,  a  nonnative  aggressive  invasive  plant  species  that  significantly  affects 
Wetland  diversity  and  habitat  structure  with  resultant  significant  impacts  to  wildlife  habitat 
quality.  However,  wetlands  are  an  important  habitat,  and  the  alteration  of  these  wetlands  would 
be  noticeable.

2.2.5  Barren  Land 

Approximately  19  ac  of  onsite  barren  land  would  be  disturbed  from  building  activities.  This 
includes  permanent  impacts  of  nearly  all  of  the  15  ac  of  altered  lands  and  4  ac  of  disturbed 
wetlands  (modified).  Temporary  effects  on  barren  land  on  the  site  include  less  than  1  ac  of  the 
available  disturbed  wetlands  (modified)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Offsite  barren  land  disturbances  in  the  vicinity  include  approximately  13  ac  of  temporary  effects 
in  the  offsite  adjacent  areas.  There  are  no  barren  land  disturbances  expected  for  the  building 
activities  associated  with  the  proposed  causeway  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Disturbances  to  barren  lands  represent  approximately  3  percent  of  the  available  651  ac  of 
barren  land  in  the  vicinity  and  less  than  1  percent  of  the  54,164  barren  lands  available  in  the 
region  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Building  effects  to  barren  land  would  not  noticeably  affect  barren 
land  habitats  in  the  vicinity. 

2.2.6  Managed  Wetlands 

The  applicant  proposes  to  temporarily  disturb  2.7  ac,  or  71  percent,  of  the  available  managed 
wetlands  on  the  proposed  PSEG  Site.  There  will  be  no  permanent  impacts  to  managed 
wetlands,  and  there  are  no  managed  wetlands  available  in  offsite  areas  or  proposed  causeway 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  This  disturbance  would  not  noticeably  affect  managed  wetlands  in  the 
vicinity. 

2.2.7  Agricultural  Lands 

Agricultural  lands  that  potentially  would  be  affected  by  preconstruction  and  construction  include 
near  offsite  areas  along  the  proposed  causeway  route.  These  agricultural  land  cover  types  are 
located  at  the  north  end  of  the  proposed  causeway  in  Elsinboro  Township.  These  plant 
communities  consist  of  cultivated  crops  and  adventitious  weedy  species.  The  proposed 
causeway  would  disturb  12.6  ac  of  agricultural  land  in  the  vicinity.  The  causeway  would 
permanently  disturb  12.4  ac  and  temporarily  disturb  0.2  ac.  No  permanent  or  temporary 
impacts  to  agricultural  lands  would  result  from  onsite  building  activities  at  the  ESP  site.  The 
affected  agricultural  lands  represent  less  than  1  percent  of  agricultural  lands  available  in  the 
vicinity  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  These  impacts  would  not  noticeably  affect  the  available 
agricultural  habitats  in  the  vicinity. 

2.3  Noise  and  Fugitive  Dust  Impacts 

Preconstruction  and  construction  activities  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  that  produce  noise  and 
fugitive  dust  likely  would  displace  wildlife  into  habitat  surrounding  work  areas.  Peak  noise  level 
associated  with  preconstruction  and  construction  activities  would  be  102  A-weighted  decibels 
(dBA)  50  ft  away  from  work  areas  and  would  attenuate  to  58  dBA  1 ,500  ft  away.  Behavioral 
effects  attributed  to  noise  could  decrease  chances  for  wildlife  survival  and  successful 
reproduction.  Effects  on  wildlife  can  range  from  nonexistent  to  serious,  depending  on  the 
species  and  the  situation  (Larkin  1996-TN772).  During  frequent  noise  events  that  exceeded 
80  dBA,  waterfowl  activities  demonstrated  only  minimal  responses  to  individual  events  with  no 
noticeable  disruptions  of  typical  behavior  patterns,  indicating  that  avian  species  quickly

accommodated  to  the  noise  events  (Fleming  et  al.  2001-TN2419).  It  is  anticipated  that  general 
noise  levels  from  preconstruction  and  construction  would  dissipate  within  a  short  distance  to 
ambient  levels  well  below  that  which  would  normally  cause  a  response  in  wildlife  (NRC  2013- 
TN2654). 

Principal  noise  sources  at  an  operating  nuclear  power  plant  include  natural  draft  and 
mechanical  draft  cooling  towers,  transformers,  and  loudspeakers  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  The 
bounding  noise  level  from  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  for 
operational  noise  emissions  is  associated  with  fan-assisted  natural  draft  cooling  towers 
(NDCTs).  as  presented  in  the  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report  in  the  PSEG  ESP  application  (PSEG 
201 5-TN4283).  The  estimated  dBA  noise  emission  for  this  type  of  cooling  tower  is  60  dBA  at 
1,000  ft.  Noise  measurements  recorded  on  the  site  demonstrate  that  existing  noise  levels 
attenuate  to  a  maximum  of  51 .6  dBA  (a  value  typical  of  ambient  low  noise  environments)  near 
the  site  boundary  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Noise  from  onsite  sources  associated  with  the  proposed  site  attenuates  with  distance.  For 
example,  a  source  with  a  noise  level  of  50  dBA  at  1 ,000  ft  has  a  noise  level  of  44  dBA  at 
2,000  ft  from  the  source,  and  a  source  with  a  noise  level  of  60  dBA  at  1 ,000  ft  has  a  dBA  of  54 
at  2,000  ft.  A  2009  baseline  ambient  noise  survey  indicates  noise  from  sources  at  the  existing 
HCGS  and  SGS  facilities  attenuates  to  levels  that  generally  represent  background  noise  values 
in  natural  environments  (Table  3).  This  noise  level  is  similar  to  that  measured  near  the  PSEG 
Site  boundary.  Noise  sources  within  the  adjacent  marsh  environment  include  wind,  rustling  of 
reeds  and  grasses  (Phragmites),  and  animal  noises  (frog  calls,  bird  songs,  etc.)  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  There  are  no  known  Federally  listed  threatened  or  endangered  terrestrial  species 
within  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  that  potentially  could  be  affected  by  plant  operation  noise.  In 
addition,  the  expected  noise  level  is  well  below  threshold  levels  that  would  generally  exhibit  a 
response  in  wildlife  populations.  Thus,  effects  of  noise  from  operation  of  the  proposed  site  are 
expected  to  be  minimal.

PSEG  proposes  to  suppress  fugitive  dust  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  offsite  preconstruction  and 
construction  areas  by  using  water  from  local  stormwater  retention  ponds  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 
The  impact  of  fugitive  dust  to  wildlife  species  would  be  negligible. 

2.4  Potential  for  Wildlife  Collisions  with  Human-made  Structures 

Avian  and  bat  collisions  with  human-made  structures  can  be  attributed  to  numerous  factors 
related  to  species  characteristics  such  as  flight  behavior,  age,  habitat  use,  seasonal  and  diurnal 
habitats,  and  environmental  characteristics  such  as  weather,  topography,  land  use,  and 
orientation  of  the  structures.  This  is  a  particular  concern  in  the  area  of  the  PSEG  Site  because 
it  is  in  the  Atlantic  Flyway,  a  major  bird  migration  route.  Additionally,  bat  hibernacula  are  known 
to  occur  in  northern  and  central  portions  of  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  Bird  and  bat  collisions 
with  construction  equipment,  such  as  cranes  or  new  structures,  have  the  potential  to  occur  at 
the  PSEG  Site.  Studies  of  avian  and  bat  collisions  with  elevated  construction  equipment  are 
lacking.  However,  surveys  conducted  in  the  vicinity  of  other  human-made  structures,  such  as 
NDCTs  and  wind  turbines,  indicate  that  avian  and  bat  mortalities  as  a  result  of  collisions  could 
occur.  The  findings  of  NUREG-1437,  Generic  Environmental  Impact  Statement  for  License 
Renewal  of  Nuclear  Plants  (GEIS),  demonstrated  that  mortalities  as  a  result  of  avian  collisions 
with  existing  structures  at  nuclear  power  plants  are  minor  and  typically  occur  with  structures 
greater  than  300  ft  tall  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  In  addition,  a  study  on  bat  collisions  with  wind 
turbine  towers  indicated  that  only  a  small  fraction  of  bats  collide  with  towers,  and  the  collisions 
weren’t  sufficient  to  alter  populations  (Erickson  et  al.  2002-TN771 ).  The  tallest  structure  on  the 
PSEG  Site  is  the  512-ft  NDCT  associated  with  HCGS  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  During  a  yearlong 
study  from  1985  to  1986,  PSEG  counted  30  avian  mortalities  with  no  Federally  or  State-listed 
endangered  or  threatened  species  noted  (PSEG  1987-TN2893).  Therefore,  the  effects  of  such 
collisions  during  preconstruction  and  construction  at  the  PSEG  Site  are  expected  to  be 
negligible. 

2.5  Cooling  System  Impacts  on  Vegetation 

Operation  of  cooling  systems  for  a  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  poses 
the  most  significant  risk  to  vegetation.  The  proposed  cooling  systems  will  use  a  recirculating 
(closed  cycle)  cooling  water  system  that  includes  NDCTs,  mechanical  draft  cooling  towers 
(MDCTs),  or  fan-assisted  cooling  towers  during  normal  operations.  The  circulating  water 
system  (CWS)  cooling  towers  would  be  the  tallest  structure  on  the  site  at  a  potential  height  of 
600  ft  and  would  dissipate  heat  at  a  rate  of  1 .508  *  1 010  Btu/hour  with  evaporation  losses  as 
high  as  25,264  gpm  and  a  drift  loss  as  high  as  12  gpm.  The  service  water  system  (SWS)  would 
provide  cooling  functions  for  systems  not  serviced  by  the  CWS  during  operation  and  during 
cooldown,  refueling,  and  plant  startup  modes.  The  shorter  SWS  cooling  towers  dissipate  heat 
at  a  maximum  rate  of  2,284  gpm  and  a  maximum  drift  loss  of  4  gpm  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 
Because  the  effects  from  the  SWS  cooling  towers  would  be  less  significant  than  the  CWS 
cooling  towers,  discussion  of  potential  impacts  as  a  result  of  cooling  system  operation  will  be 
limited  to  the  CWS  cooling  towers. 

Heat  from  operation  of  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  be  transferred  to  the 
atmosphere  in  the  form  of  water  vapor  and  drift  from  cooling  towers.  Vapor  plumes  and  drift  can 
affect  crops,  ornamental  vegetation,  and  native  plants,  while  water  losses  can  affect  shoreline

Appendix  F 


habitat.  Total  dissolved  solids  found  in  the  vapor  and  drift  have  the  potential  to  be  deposited 
onto  foliage  or  soil  and  cause  visible  damage  (e.g.,  necrotic  tissue  and  other  deformities)  and/or 
chronic  effects  (e.g.,  reduced  growth  and  increased  susceptibility  to  disease).  PSEG’s  ER 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280),  Section  5. 3. 3. 2,  indicates  that  plants  are  generally  not  damaged  by  salt 
deposition  rates  of  1  to  2  kg/ha  per  month.  Salt  deposition  rates  greater  than  10  kg/ha  per 
month  during  the  growing  season  have  the  potential  to  cause  leaf  damage  in  some  vegetation 
species  (NRC  201 3-TN2654). 

The  linear  mechanical  draft  cooling  tower  (LMDCT)  has  greater  potential  for  salt  drift  than  other 
proposed  cooling  tower  structures.  Therefore,  discussion  of  salt  deposition  as  a  result  of 
cooling  tower  drift  will  be  limited  to  the  deposition  rate  of  the  LMDCT.  The  results  of  Seasonal 
and  Annual  Cooling  Tower  Impacts  prediction  code  modeling  conducted  by  PSEG  for  the 
proposed  site  shows  that  the  maximum  salt  deposition  rate  during  any  season  is  1 .31  kg/ha  per 
month  (1.17  Ib/ac  per  month)  during  the  winter.  The  maximum  expected  salt  deposition  rate  in 
any  direction  is  0.89  kg/ha  per  month  (0.80  Ib/ac  per  month).  These  salt  deposition  rates  fall 
within  the  rate  described  by  PSEG  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  as  generally  not  damaging  to  plants 
(NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289). 

Analyses  performed  by  PSEG  have  shown  the  cooling  tower  drift  over  terrestrial  habitats  is 
primarily  to  the  east  (within  coastal  wetlands)  (Figure  4)  and  southeast  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Most 
of  the  plant  communities  within  the  salt  drift  zone  that  would  be  exposed  to  drift  from  the  PSEG 
cooling  towers  are  salt  marsh  or  brackish  marsh  ecosystems  dominated  by  species  ( Phragmites 
australis  and  Spartina  alterniflora)  with  medium  to  high  salinity  tolerance.  Surveys  conducted 
previously  at  the  PSEG  Site  did  not  record  any  impacts  from  salt  deposition  due  to  drift  from  the 
existing  HCGS  NDCT  for  any  specific  plant  species.  Damage  to  native  vegetation  has  not 
occurred  at  HCGS,  which  uses  brackish  water  for  cooling  and  represents  a  comparatively  high 
probability  of  impact  from  operation  of  natural  draft  towers  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999- 
TN289;  PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Drift  deposition  also  has  the  potential  to  damage  vegetation  through  soil  salinization.  However, 
soil  salinization  usually  does  not  occur  in  areas  where  rainfall  is  sufficient  to  leach  salts  from  the 
soil  profile.  In  humid  environments,  effects  of  drift  deposition  on  soils  appear  to  be  transitory,  if 
they  can  be  detected  at  all  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289). 

Previous  evaluations  of  increased  fogging,  icing,  humidity,  and/or  precipitation  due  to  cooling 
tower  drift  have  been  conducted  for  nuclear  power  plants  with  cooling  towers  (natural  draft  and 
mechanical  draft).  No  significant  impacts  were  reported  as  a  result  of  these  evaluations 
(NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289;  PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  In  addition,  based  on  an  analysis 
conducted  for  the  proposed  site,  the  duration  of  any  fogging  and  other  cooling  tower  induced 
precipitation  events  would  be  expected  to  be  low  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280).

Based  on  these  results,  combined  with  the  nature  of  the  local  plant  communities,  the  potential 
effects  of  proposed  site  cooling  tower  operation  on  surrounding  plant  communities  on  the  PSEG 
Site  and  in  the  vicinity  would  be  expected  to  be  minimal  (NRC  1996-TN288;  NRC  1999-TN289). 

2.6  Impacts  of  Artificial  Light 

Artificial  light  can  affect  wildlife  by  both  disorientation  and  attraction.  Night  migrating  bird 
species  can  be  impacted  when  meteorological  conditions,  such  as  inclement  weather,  bring 
them  into  close  proximity  with  artificial  lighting.  Birds  may  become  disoriented  and  collide  with 
each  other  or  structures,  become  exhausted,  or  be  taken  by  predators  (Longcore  2004- 
TN3189).  Artificial  lighting  may  affect  terrestrial  mammal  nocturnal  predator-prey  relationships 
(Beier  2006-TN2380).  Light  pollution  also  may  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  the 
selection  of  flight  routes  by  bats  (Stone  et  al.  2009-TN3190).  When  exposed  to  artificial  light, 
green  frogs  were  found  to  exhibit  fewer  advertisement  calls  and  moved  more  frequently  than 
they  did  under  ambient  light  conditions;  this  could  result  in  potential  impacts  on  recruitment 
rates,  leading  to  effects  on  population  dynamics  (Baker  and  Richardson  2006-TN2379). 

Down  shielding  of  lights  to  prevent  light  from  being  directed  into  the  night  sky  can  help  reduce 
the  effect  on  migratory  birds.  This  means  lights  can  be  shielded  so  that  the  pattern  of 
illumination  is  below  the  horizontal  plane  of  the  light  fixture.  However,  this  will  not  prevent 
potential  impacts  to  other  species,  such  as  frogs  (Longcore  2004-TN3189). 

Additional  lighting  effects  could  be  lessened  by  using  low  sodium  lighting.  Down  shielding,  as 
described  above,  could  be  employed  to  further  mitigate  certain  impacts.  Operating  experience 
with  HOGS  has  shown  that  bird  collisions  with  units  have  not  been  a  noticeable  issue 
(PSEG  1987-TN2893).  It  is  not  expected  that  the  incremental  effect  of  lighting  added  for  the 
proposed  site  would  increase  impacts  to  noticeable  levels,  particularly  if  down  shielding  and 
other  best  management  practices  (BMPs)  were  to  be  employed.  With  the  use  of  appropriate 
BMPs,  impacts  to  terrestrial  wildlife  from  the  additional  lighting  at  the  new  PSEG  Site  are 
expected  to  be  minimal. 

2.7  Impacts  of  Increased  Vehicle  Traffic 

Increased  traffic  as  a  result  of  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  has  the 
potential  to  increase  wildlife  mortality  caused  by  vehicle  collisions.  PSEG  estimates  that  the 
onsite  workforce  could  increase  by  600  employees  during  normal  day-to-day  operations  and  by 
1,000  employees  during  refueling  operations  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  increase  in  workforce 
population  would  increase  the  amount  of  vehicle  traffic  on  the  site  and  in  the  vicinity.  Local 
wildlife  populations  could  decline  if  roadkill  rates  exceed  the  rates  of  reproduction  and 
immigration.  However,  roadkills  occur  frequently,  and  wildlife  populations  are  not  significantly 
affected  (Forman  and  Alexander  1998-TN2250).  No  individual  Federally  or  State-listed 
threatened  or  endangered  species  were  identified  that  would  be  adversely  affected  by  vehicle 
traffic.  Therefore,  the  effect  of  increased  traffic  on  terrestrial  wildlife  populations  on  the  site  and 
in  the  vicinity  would  be  minimal. 

The  proposed  causeway  will  be  constructed  on  piers  to  preserve  wildlife  travel  corridors.  By 
allowing  wildlife  travel  below  the  causeway,  this  elevated  design  also  will  help  to  minimize  the 


November  2015 


F. 3.3-67 


NUREG-2168 


F-313 


Appendix  F 


possibility  for  wildlife-vehicle  collisions  and  wildlife  mortality  over  conventional  roadways  built  on 
embankments.  The  elevated  design  of  this  structure  will  also  minimize  potential  impacts  to 
plant  communities.  Permanent  impacts  to  wetland  plant  communities  along  the  causeway  will 
be  limited  to  placement  of  piers  and  direct  shading.  Shading  could  potentially  result  in  some 
alteration  of  plant  community  makeup  under  the  bridge  and  a  reduction  in  primary  productivity 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280).  However,  because  the  effect  will  be  to  a  small  area  relative  to  the 
overall  plant  community,  impacts  are  expected  to  be  minimal. 

2.8  Impacts  to  Shoreline  Habitat 

Based  on  the  proposed  Site  Utilization  Plan  (as  shown  in  Figure  3),  the  western  shoreline  of 
PSEG  will  be  modified  with  the  development  of  shoreline  plant  features  that  include  the  water 
intake  structure,  heavy  haul  road,  and  barge  facility.  In  total,  9.5  ac  of  nearshore  water  and 
riparian  shoreline  will  be  impacted  below  the  coastal  wetland  boundary,  also  known  as  the  New 
Jersey  upper  wetland  boundary.  Based  on  the  Site  Utilization  Plan,  the  shoreline  will  be 
constructed  as  a  stabilized  shoreline  (using  riprap  or  other  appropriate  treatment)  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  This  will  be  the  condition  of  the  shoreline  during  the  operational  phase  of  the  PSEG 
project. 

The  already  disturbed  nature  of  the  shoreline  before  the  proposed  stabilization  likely  provided 
marginal  habitat  for  most  terrestrial  species.  The  main  use  of  these  areas  would  have  been 
some  riparian  zone/edge  birds,  as  well  as  waterfowl  and  other  birds  on  the  open  water.  Open 
water  habitat  will  remain  during  the  operational  stage  of  the  PSEG  project  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280).  The  riparian  zone,  on  the  other  hand,  will  provide  little  habitat  with  the  establishment 
of  the  riprap  bank.  However,  there  are  large  areas  of  similar  shoreline  habitat  of  higher  quality 
in  the  vicinity  of  the  site.  Therefore,  it  is  expected  that  the  shoreline  modifications  in  place 
during  the  operational  stage  of  the  PSEG  project  will  have  a  negligible  impact  on  terrestrial 
wildlife  populations. 

2.9  Impacts  of  Transmission  Lines 

This  section  addresses  potential  operational  effects  of  transmission  systems  on  terrestrial 
resources.  This  includes  the  transmission  system  itself  and  any  ROW  associated  with  the 
proposed  site.  The  transmission  needs  for  the  proposed  site  include  two  to  three  new  onsite 
lines  crossing  between  two  proposed  switchyards  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Two  potential  offsite 
transmission  line  routes  are  being  considered  by  the  regional  transmission  line  provider  to 
support  grid  stability  and  are  discussed  as  part  of  cumulative  impacts. 

2.9.1  Vegetation 

The  Public  Service  Electric  and  Gas  Company  (PSE&G)  is  responsible  for  maintaining  the 
transmission  lines  and  rights-of-way  associated  with  HCGS  and  SGS  in  New  Jersey  and  to 
ensure  that  important  terrestrial  habitats  and  species  are  protected  in  accordance  with  resource 
agency  approved  BMPs.  Potential  effects  from  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  new 
transmission  systems  are  based  on  established  procedures  PSE&G  uses  for  existing  lines 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 


NUREG-21 68 


F. 3. 3-68 

F-314 


November  201 5 


Appendix  F 


PSE&G  transmission  lines  and  rights-of-way  are  surveyed  by  air  and  ground  approximately 
five  times  a  year  to  ensure  the  physical  and  electrical  integrity  of  transmission  line  supports, 
hardware,  insulators,  and  conductors  are  acceptable  for  safe  and  reliable  service.  Climbing 
inspections  of  structures  are  performed  approximately  every  three  years,  with  the  frequency 
dependent  on  the  age  of  the  line  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

PSE&G  employs  maintenance  measures  to  keep  woody  vegetation  at  least  30  ft  from 
conductors  wherever  transmission  lines  cross  wooded  areas.  The  primary  method  used  for 
maintenance  of  the  transmission  line  ROW  is  mechanical  clearing.  For  areas  that  contain 
wetlands,  ROW  maintenance  is  typically  performed  manually  in  accordance  with  resource 
agency  approved  BMPs.  In  accordance  with  an  integrated  pest  management  program, 
herbicides  are  used  to  prevent  sprouting  from  fast  growing  woody  vegetation.  For  any  herbicide 
applications  that  may  be  required  in  or  near  waterways  or  wetlands,  only  herbicides  specifically 
labeled  for  use  in  waterways  are  used,  consistent  with  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency 
(EPA)  label  requirements  and  NJDEP  regulations.  Periodic  inspections  are  conducted  to 
ensure  that  appropriate  clearances  between  tall  vegetation  and  conductors  are  maintained 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Important  habitats  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  wetlands.  It  is  not  anticipated  that  transmission  line 
ROW  maintenance  normally  required  to  control  woody  vegetation  will  be  necessary  on  the  site 
because  the  onsite  transmission  lines  run  through  herbaceous  coastal  wetlands.  These  onsite 
coastal  wetlands  are  disturbed  habitats  dominated  by  common  reed  that  does  not  grow  tall 
enough  to  interfere  with  overhead  transmission  lines.  Consequently,  onsite  transmission  line 
maintenance  activities  most  likely  will  be  restricted  to  minimal  mechanical  clearing  and/or 
herbicide  application.  Therefore,  impacts  to  important  terrestrial  habitats  resulting  from  the 
operation  and  maintenance  of  onsite  transmission  line  systems  are  expected  to  be  minimal 
(PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

Saltmarsh  cordgrass  is  the  only  identified  important  plant  group  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Saltmarsh 
cordgrass  is  essential  to  the  function  of  the  coastal  marsh  and  is  an  important  component  of 
coastal  wetlands  in  marsh  restoration  sites.  Cordgrass  has  not  been  observed  in  onsite  areas 
near  the  planned  transmission  lines.  Furthermore,  the  transmission  lines  are  elevated  and 
would  not  interfere  with  any  future  establishment  of  these  plants  on  the  site.  Also,  as  stated 
above,  the  need  for  routine  use  of  herbicides  or  mechanical  clearing  as  part  of  any  onsite 
transmission  line  maintenance  activities  would  be  minimal,  if  required  at  all.  Therefore,  impacts 
to  saltmarsh  cordgrass  associated  with  the  maintenance  and  operation  of  the  onsite 
transmission  lines  are  not  anticipated  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

2.9.2  Wildlife 

Section  4. 5. 6. 2  of  the  GEIS  provides  a  thorough  discussion  of  bird  collisions  associated  with 
operating  transmission  lines.  Avian  collisions  with  transmission  systems  are  dependent  on  site- 
specific  variables  such  as  nesting,  foraging,  and  roosting.  Additionally,  factors  such  as  line 
orientation  to  flight  patterns  and  movements,  species  composition,  and  line  design  are  factors  in 
avian  collisions.  The  GEIS  determined  that  bird  collisions  with  transmission  lines  were  more 
likely  to  occur  with  large-bodied  species  such  as  raptors,  and  smaller  species  such  as  song 
birds  were  more  likely  to  collide  with  towers  (NRC  201 3-TN2654).

Threatened  and  endangered  species  of  large-bodied  and  small-bodied  birds  have  the  potential 
to  be  affected  where  transmission  lines  pass  through  areas  where  these  species  are 
concentrated.  Several  State-listed  species  have  the  potential  to  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site  or  in 
the  vicinity.  However,  field  surveys  conducted  from  2009  to  2010  did  not  identify  significant 
concentrations  of  these  species  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  Additionally,  PSEG’s  wildlife 
management  practices  would  be  required  to  comply  with  the  Migratory  Bird  Treaty  Act  (16  USC 
703  et  seq.  -TN3331)  regarding  nest  removals  and  maintenance  activities.  PSEG  includes 
appropriate  measures  in  the  design  of  transmission  lines  to  reduce  the  potential  for  avian 
collisions.  In  addition,  current  design  standards  for  phase-to-phase  and  phase-to-ground 
clearances  for  high  transmission  voltages  are  generally  considerably  greater  than  wing-to-wing 
or  wing-to-foot  spans  for  even  the  larger  birds.  Electrocution  is  rarely  a  problem  for  500  kV 
transmission  lines  (PSEG  2012-TN2389).  Therefore,  bird  mortality  resulting  from  the  collisions 
with  transmission  line  systems  on  the  PSEG  Site  or  in  the  vicinity  is  expected  to  be  a  small 
fraction  of  the  total  mortality  and  would  not  pose  as  a  significant  threat  to  overall  populations. 

Transmission  line  ROW  management  practices  have  the  potential  to  affect  wildlife  on  the  PSEG 
Site  and  vicinity.  ROW  development  represents  a  barrier  to  larger,  more  mobile  species  that 
require  continuous  tracts  of  forested  habitat  and  to  smaller,  less  mobile  species  that  have 
difficulty  crossing  disturbed  habitat  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  Much  of  the  proposed  transmission 
line  ROWs  on  the  site  have  been  developed  previously  or  are  dominated  by  common  reed 
(PSEG  201 5-TN4280).  Because  of  the  vegetation  types  in  the  proposed  onsite  transmission 
line  corridor,  PSEG  does  not  expect  a  need  to  conduct  maintenance  activities  of  the 
transmission  line  ROWs.  Transmission  line  ROWs  on  the  PSEG  Site  are  not  expected  to 
adversely  impact  terrestrial  wildlife  species. 

2.9.3  Electromagnetic  Fields 

Studies  have  indicated  that  electromagnetic  fields  (EMFs)  associated  with  transmission  lines 
could  affect  flora  and  fauna  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  Plant  foliage  in  the  vicinity  of  strong 
electromagnetic  fields  (greater  than  1 , 1 00  kV)  has  been  shown  to  incur  damage  to  tips  of  leaves 
and  buds,  similar  to  the  stresses  that  may  occur  as  a  result  of  drought.  However,  the  damage  is 
limited  to  those  plants  located  close  to  transmission  lines  and  generally  does  not  interfere  with 
overall  growth.  Additionally,  transmission  lines  energized  at  levels  less  than  765  kV  are  not 
expected  to  affect  most  terrestrial  fauna.  The  transmission  lines  that  would  be  constructed  for 
PSEG  would  operate  only  at  500  kV  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  which  is  much  lower  than  the 
1,100  kV  threshold  for  EMF  effects  on  flora  and  765  kV  threshold  for  terrestrial  fauna. 

Therefore,  the  increased  EMF  posed  by  the  operation  of  the  proposed  transmission  lines  is 
expected  to  have  only  a  minimal  impact  on  terrestrial  flora  and  fauna. 

3.0  FEDERALLY  LISTED  SPECIES  CONSIDERED 

Based  on  NRC  review  of  sources  from  FWS  and  the  states  of  Delaware  and  New  Jersey,  one 
Federally  threatened  bat  species  and  one  Federally  threatened  bird  species  were  identified  with 
the  potential  to  be  present  in  the  site  vicinity  that  was  not  previously  discussed  in  the  August 
2014  BA  (NRC  2014-TN4268).  These  species  are  northern  long-eared  bat  ( Myotis 
septentrionalis)  and  rufa  red  knot  ( Calidris  canutus  rufa).  Accordingly,  this  BA  focuses  on

evaluating  the  potential  effects  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG 
Site  on  the  northern  long-eared  bat  and  rufa  red  knot  (NRC  2014-TN4313). 

3.1  Northern  Long-eared  Bat 

3.1.1  Species  Description 

The  northern  long-eared  bat  is  a  medium  size  bat  species  with  adults  averaging  0.2  to 
0.3  ounces.  Female  bats  are  slightly  larger  than  their  male  counterparts.  Their  average  body 
length  is  from  3.0  to  3.7  inches  long.  They  are  medium  to  dark  brown  on  their  back,  ears,  and 
wing  membranes  and  tawny  to  pale  brown  on  their  ventral  side.  The  most  distinguishing 
characteristic  of  the  bat  is  its  long  ears,  which  can  extend  up  to  0.2  inches  beyond  its  muzzle. 
The  ears  are  pointed  and  symmetrical  with  a  long  tragus  (0.4  inches)  (80  FR  17974-TN4216). 

3.1.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

The  northern  long-eared  bat’s  eastern  range  extends  from  Maine  to  the  Florida  panhandle. 
However,  populations  are  found  in  patches  and  are  more  common  in  the  northern  part  of  its 
range  than  the  southern  portions.  Over  780  hibernacula  have  been  discovered  in  its  range  in 
the  United  States  with  only  a  few  individuals  in  each  hibernaculum  (80  FR  17974-TN4216). 

Hibernacula  used  by  northern  long-eared  bats  are  typically  large,  with  large  passages,  constant 
cool  temperatures,  high  humidity,  and  no  air  currents.  Additionally,  northern  long-eared  bats 
have  been  seen  overwintering  in  railroad  tunnels,  storm  sewers,  and  other  unexpected  retreats. 
In  the  summer,  northern  long-eared  bats  roost  underneath  bark  or  in  crevices  or  cavities  of  live 
trees  and  snags  of  various  tree  species.  Tree  species  include  black  oak  ( Quercus  velutina), 
northern  red  oak  (Quercus  rubra),  silver  maple  (Acer  saccharinum),  black  locust  (Robinia 
pseudoacacia ),  American  beech  (Fagus  grandifolia),  sugar  maple  (Acer  saccharum),  sourwood 
(Oxydendrum  arboreum),  and  shortleaf  pine  (Pinus  echinata).  They  also  have  been  observed 
roosting  in  or  under  the  eaves  of  human-made  structures  such  as  barns,  buildings,  sheds,  and 
cabins.  Northern  long-eared  bats  are  not  a  long  distance  migratory  species,  and  movements 
between  summer  and  winter  hibernacula  are  between  35  mi  and  55  mi.  Breeding  occurs 
between  late  July  and  early  October.  Home  ranges  are  approximately  46  to  425  ac  for  females 
and  161  ac  for  males.  Northern  long-eared  bats  emerge  at  dusk  and  fly  along  hillsides  through 
forest  understory,  gleaning  insects  from  vegetation.  They  have  a  diverse  diet  of  insects,  most 
commonly  beetles,  moths,  and  arachnids.  Mature  forests  are  an  important  habitat  for  the 
northern  long-eared  bat's  foraging  technique  (80  FR  17974-TN4216). 

Maternity  roosts  and  hibernacula  for  the  northern  long-eared  bat  are  known  to  occur  in  the 
following  New  Jersey  counties:  Atlantic,  Bergen,  Burlington,  Camden,  Hunterdon,  Mercer, 
Morris,  Ocean,  Passaic,  Salem,  Somerset,  Sussex,  and  Warren  (FWS  2014-TN3208).  No 
surveys  were  conducted  on  the  PSEG  Site  for  bats  species.  However,  suitable  habitat  for 
hibernacula  and  maternity  roosts  are  limited  in  the  6-mi  vicinity.  Important  foraging  habitat  does 
not  exist  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Northern  long-eared  bat  are  known  to  occur  in  the  northern  and 
central  portions  of  Salem  County,  New  Jersey  (80  FR  17974-TN4216).

3.1.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

The  northern  long-eared  bat  was  proposed  for  listing  under  the  ESA  (16  USC  1531  et  seq.  - 
TNI 010)  on  December  2,  2013,  and  was  listed  as  threatened  on  May  4,  2015.  The  northern 
long-eared  bat  was  most  abundant  in  the  eastern  portion  of  its  range.  It  has  experienced  a 
severe  and  rapid  decline,  estimated  at  approximately  99  percent,  since  the  introduction  of  white 
nose  disease  (first  discovered  in  2007)  in  its  northeast  range.  The  primary  threat  to  the  northern 
long-eared  bat  is  attributed  to  white  nose  disease  caused  by  the  fungus  Geomyces  destructans. 
The  threat  of  white  nose  disease  is  expected  to  increase  and  continue  to  extirpate  northern 
long-eared  bat  populations  as  it  spreads  throughout  its  range  (80  FR  17974-TN4216). 

3.2  Rufa  Red  Knot 

3.2.1  Species  Description 

The  rufa  red  knot  is  9-1 1  (in)  in  length  and  considered  a  medium  size  shorebird.  In  the  spring 
adults  are  finely  mottled  with  colors  that  include  grays,  black,  and  ochre  running  into  stripes  on 
the  crown.  The  throat,  breast  and  sides  of  the  head  are  a  cinnamon-brown  colorand  there  is  a 
dark  gray  line  through  the  eye.  The  abdomen  and  undertail  coverts  are  white,  and  the  uppertail 
coverts  are  white  and  barred  with  black.  Adults  red  knots  in  winter  are  pale  ashy  gray  above 
from  the  rump  to  the  crown  and  feathers  on  the  back  are  narrowly  edged  with  white.  The 
underparts  are  white  and  the  breast  is  lightly  streaked  and  speckled,  with  flanks  narrowly  barred 
with  gray.  In  the  fall  the  underparts  of  some  individuals  have  traces  of  “red”  from  the  spring 
(79  FR  73705-TN4267). 

3.2.2  Distribution  and  Habitat 

Red  knots  migrate  annually  between  their  breeding  grounds  in  the  Canadian  Arctic  and 
wintering  locations  in  the  Southeast  United  States,  Northeast  Gulf  of  Mexico,  northern  Brazil, 
and  Tierra  del  Fuego  located  on  the  southern  tip  of  Argentina.  It  uses  the  Delaware  Bay  as  a 
final  stopover  for  migrations  to  breeding  grounds  in  the  spring. 

Red  knots  are  found  primarily  on  beaches  of  sand  or  peat  at  the  mouths  of  tidal  creeks,  along 
the  edge  of  tidal  marshes  dominated  by  salt  marsh  cordgrass  ( Spartina  alternaflora )  and 
saltmeadow  cordgrass  (S.  patens ),  and  in  salt  pannes  (shallow,  high  salinity,  mud-bottomed 
depressions  on  the  marsh  surface)  and  shallow  coastal  ponds  or  embayments.  Radio  tracking 
showed  that  most  of  the  time  red  knots  roosted  along  the  shoreline  or  in  sandy  washovers 
above  the  high  tide  line,  but  knots  also  roosted  in  bare,  shallow-water  openings  0.5  to  1 .3  mi 
(850  to  2,050  m)  inland  in  adjacent  salt  marsh.  The  preference  for  inland  roost  sites  was 
greater  at  night  and  during  spring  tides,  and  Delaware  Bay  is  the  only  area  in  which  rufa  red 
knots  have  been  observed  roosting  inland. 

Red  knots  must  take  advantage  of  seasonally  abundant  food  sources  at  migration  stopovers  to 
build  up  fat  reserves  for  the  next  leg  of  migration.  Delaware  Bay  serves  as  a  seasonal  migration 
stopover  for  red  knots  due  to  the  abundance  of  horseshoe  crab  eggs  available.

3.2.3  Population  Trends  and  ESA  Status 

The  red  knot  was  added  to  the  Federal  list  of  candidate  species  in  2006.  On  December  1 1 , 
2014  the  final  rule  was  published  (79  FR  73705-TN4267)  to  list  the  rufa  subspecies  as 
threatened  under  the  ESA  (16  USC  1531  et  seq.  -TNI 010).  The  effective  date  of  listing  was 
January  12,  2015.  A  decline  in  the  red  knot  population  in  the  2000s  was  caused  mainly  by  a 
reduction  in  the  availability  of  food  resulting  from  increased  horseshoe  crab  harvests,  which  was 
compounded  by  small  changes  in  the  timing  that  the  red  knot  arrived  at  Delaware  Bay.  It  is  also 
thought  that  the  red  knot  may  be  particularly  susceptible  to  impacts  of  global  climate  change, 
which  is  likely  to  effect  their  breeding  grounds  in  in  the  arctic  tundra.  Other  likely  factors  in  the 
bird’s  decline  include  impacts  on  quality  and  quantity  of  coastal  habitats  due  to  rising  sea  levels, 
rangewide  quantity  and  timing  of  invertebrate  food  resources,  and  storm  and  weather  pattern 
severity,  timing  and  location  (79  FR  73705-TN4267). 

4.0  PROPOSED  ACTION  EFFECTS  ANALYSIS 

This  section  provides  descriptions  of  potential  building  and  operations  impacts  on  the  Federally 
threatened  northern  long-eared  bat  and  rufa  red  knot.  Building  and  operational  impacts  that 
potentially  could  affect  these  species  were  evaluated  based  on  habitat  presence  and  life  history 
considerations  as  well  as  the  type  and  spatial  and  temporal  nature  of  the  impacts.  The  primary 
threats  to  the  Federally  threatened  northern  long-eared  bat  and  Federally  threatened  rufa  red 
knot  from  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  include  habitat 
reduction,  fragmentation,  degradation,  and  the  potential  for  mortality  as  a  result  of  increased 
vehicle  traffic  and  collisions  with  site  structures. 

4.1  Habitat  Loss 

Habitat  suitable  for  supporting  hibernacula  and  maternity  roost  for  the  northern  long-eared  bat 
does  not  exist  on  the  PSEG  Site.  Additionally,  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  provide  suitable  habitat 
for  foraging  northern  long-eared  bats.  Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  will  be 
no  effect  on  the  northern  long-eared  bat  as  a  result  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

The  PSEG  Site  does  not  contain  suitable  habitat  or  forage  to  support  the  rufa  red  knot. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  concludes  that  there  will  be  no  effect  on  the  rufa  red  knot  as  a  result 
of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

4.2  Cooling  System  Impacts  on  Vegetation 

The  main  concern  would  be  salt  drift  and  deposition  that  could  affect  vegetation  in  the 
surrounding  area.  However,  calculated  salt  deposition  rates  fall  within  rates  that  are  generally 
not  damaging  to  plants.  Furthermore,  most  plants  within  the  salt  drift  zone  for  the  PSEG  Site 
have  medium  to  high  salinity  tolerance.  The  review  team  has  determined  that  there  would  be 
no  effect  to  northern  long-eared  bat  or  rufa  red  knot  habitat  from  PSEG  Site  cooling  system 
operations.

4.3  Wildlife  Collisions  with  Plant  Structures 

There  has  been  documentation  of  bat  and  bird  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  with  human- 
made  structures.  However,  these  collisions  do  not  significantly  affect  bat  and  bird  populations. 
Additionally,  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  contain  habitat  suitable  for  northern  long-eared  bat 
hibernacula,  maternity  roosts,  or  foraging.  Nor  does  the  PSEG  Site  contain  suitable  habitat  or 
forage  to  support  the  rufa  red  knot.  Therefore,  bat  and  bird  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions 
with  human-made  structures  is  not  expected  to  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site. 

4.4  Impacts  of  Increased  Vehicle  Traffic 

Vehicle  traffic  is  expected  to  increase  as  a  result  of  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Increased  traffic  associated  with  the  operations  of  the  new  nuclear 
power  plant  has  the  potential  to  increase  wildlife  roadkills  due  to  collisions  with  vehicles,  and 
this  is  known  to  be  a  mortality  factor  for  bog  turtles.  The  proposed  causeway  would  be  built  on 
piers  to  limit  impacts  to  wildlife  corridors.  However,  increased  traffic  would  not  be  expected  to 
be  a  significant  cause  of  mortalities  in  northern  long-eared  bat  or  rufa  red  knot  populations. 

4.5  Transmission  Lines 

The  operation  and  maintenance  of  onsite  transmission  lines  are  not  expected  to  affect  the 
northern-long  eared  bat  or  rufa  red  knot.  Transmission  lines  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  disturb 
some  of  the  coastal  wetland  areas.  Maintenance  of  transmission  lines  in  this  area  would  not 
require  disturbing  the  natural  vegetation  that  would  grow  under  the  lines.  There  is  a  potential  for 
transmission  lines  to  cause  bat  or  bird  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  with  the  lines.  However, 
habitat  for  the  northern  long-eared  bat  and  rufa  red  knot  does  not  exist  on  the  site,  and 
collisions  in  the  vicinity  would  not  be  expected  to  occur  in  rates  that  would  result  in  the  decline 
of  migrating  bats  or  birds.  Therefore,  transmission  lines  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  not  be 
expected  to  affect  northern  long-eared  bats  or  rufa  red  knots. 

5.0  CUMULATIVE  EFFECTS  ANALYSIS 

In  addition  to  impacts  from  building  activities,  the  following  cumulative  analysis  also  considers 
other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  projects  that  could  affect  the  terrestrial 
and  wetland  ecological  resources  also  affected  by  building  and  operating  a  new  nuclear  power 
plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Cumulative  effects,  as  defined  in  50  CFR  402.02  (TN4312),  are  those 
effects  of  future  State  or  private  activities,  not  involving  Federal  activities,  which  are  reasonably 
certain  to  occur  within  the  action  area.  Future  Federal  actions  are  not  considered  in  the 
definition  of  cumulative  effects.  Direct  and  indirect  impacts  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources 
resulting  from  the  building  and  operation  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  and 
the  proposed  causeway  would  be  limited  to  Salem  County,  New  Jersey.  However,  the 
cumulative  effects  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  when  combined  with  other  actions  would 
extend  to  areas  within  the  Middle  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains,  Northern  Piedmont,  and  Atlantic 
Coastal  Pine  Barrens  ecoregions.  For  purposes  of  this  cumulative  analysis,  the  geographic 
area  of  interest  for  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  is  defined  as  the  Middle  Atlantic  Coastal 
Plains,  Northern  Piedmont,  and  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens  Level  III  ecoregions  within  50  mi

of  the  PSEG  Site.  This  geographic  region  of  interest  includes  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  and 
other  counties,  or  portions  of  counties,  in  New  Jersey,  Delaware,  Pennsylvania,  and  Maryland. 

5.1  Habitat  Loss 

The  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest  consist  of  the  Middle  Atlantic 
Coastal  Plain,  Northern  Piedmont,  and  Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens.  The  Middle  Atlantic 
Coastal  Plain  is  characterized  as  nearly  flat  topography  and  consists  of  swampy,  marshy,  and 
frequently  flooded  areas.  Upland  areas  are  dominated  by  loblolly-shortleaf  pine  forests  and 
lowland,  and  tidally  influenced  areas  support  tidal  marshes,  swamps,  floodplain  forests,  and 
pocosins.  Marshes  are  dominated  by  cord  grass  and  salt-meadow  grass.  The  Northern 
Piedmont  is  characterized  by  irregular  plains  and  low  hills.  It  is  dominated  by  mixed  oak, 
chestnut  oak,  hemlock-mixed  hardwood,  and  sugar  maple-mixed  hardwood  forests.  The 
Atlantic  Coastal  Pine  Barrens  are  low  undulating  part  of  the  Atlantic  Coastal  Plain.  Native 
habitat  in  this  area  consists  of  pine-oak  woodlands,  mixed  oak  and  beech-oak  forests,  salt 
marshes,  swamps,  freshwater  marshes,  and  floodplains  (Woods  et  al.  2007-TN3227). 

The  Atlantic  Coastal  Plains  ecoregion  has  been  altered  significantly  since  the  beginning  of 
European  settlement  in  the  1600s  as  a  result  of  agriculture,  silviculture,  and  urban  development. 
The  geographic  region  of  interest  includes  the  same  habitat  types  as  those  found  in  the  6-mi 
vicinity  of  the  site.  Habitats  within  the  6-mi  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  Site  include  barren  land, 
developed  land,  cultivated  cropland,  pasture  hay,  deciduous  forest,  evergreen  forest,  mixed 
forest,  emergent  herbaceous  wetland,  woody  wetland,  and  open  water.  However,  the  overall 
percentages  of  each  habitat  differ  when  expanding  from  the  6-mi  vicinity  to  encompass  the 
geographic  region  of  interest.  Open  water  associated  with  the  Delaware  River,  Delaware  Bay, 
and  other  open  water  areas  occupies  791 ,821  ac  (15.7  percent)  of  the  area.  Emergent 
herbaceous  wetland  occupies  199,603  ac  (4.0  percent),  and  woody  wetland  occupies 
279,248  ac  (5.5  percent).  Agricultural  land  consisting  of  cultivated  cropland  (1 ,075,101  ac)  and 
pasture  hay  (774,432  ac)  account  for  36.8  percent  of  the  land  cover.  Deciduous  forest  occupies 
1 ,028,552  ac  (20.5  percent)  of  the  habitat  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest. 

Developed  lands,  which  include  high,  medium,  low,  and  open  space  developed  land,  occupy 
630,983  ac  (12.6  percent).  Barren  lands  account  for  54,142  ac  (1.1  percent)  of  the  land  cover. 
Evergreen  and  mixed  forest  habitat  accounts  for  190,352  ac  (3.8  percent)  of  land  cover  in  the 
geographic  region  of  interest  (PSEG  2015-TN4280). 

The  USACE  created  Artificial  Island  in  the  early  1900s  with  the  authorization  of  the  Rivers  and 
Harbors  Appropriation  Act  of  1899  (33  USC  403  et  seq.  -TN660).  The  act  authorized  the 
creation  of  a  30  ft  channel  from  Philadelphia  to  Delaware  Bay  and  covered  56  miles  of  proposed 
channel.  The  amount  of  material  to  be  removed  was  estimated  at  34,953,000  yd3  of  dredge 
material  and  24,000  yd3  of  rock.  Six  locations,  including  Baker  Shoal  and  Stony  Point  Shoal, 
were  evaluated  as  potential  disposal  sites.  Baker  Shoal  and  Stony  Point  Shoal  were  enclosed 
in  1900  by  bulkheads  to  form  a  deposit  basin  now  known  as  Artificial  Island  (Snyder  and 
Guss  1974-TN2280).  Since  the  development  of  Artificial  Island,  several  dredging  projects  have 
been  conducted  that  have  altered  the  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecology  of  the  region.

Most  of  the  other  operational  projects  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest  have  resulted  in  the 
reduction,  fragmentation,  and  degradation  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  in  the  geographical 
region  of  interest.  These  projects  include  several  fossil  fuel  energy  facilities  such  as  Delaware 
City  Refinery,  Deepwater  Energy  Center,  Carneys  Point  Generating  Plant,  Pedricktown 
Combined  Cycle  Cogeneration  Plant,  Cumberland  County  Landfill  Gas-to-Energy  Plant, 

Vineland  Municipal  Electric  Utility,  Sherman  Ave.  Energy  Center,  Carl’s  Corner  Energy  Center, 
and  Cumberland  Generating  Station.  Additionally,  there  are  four  operating  nuclear  power  plants 
located  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest  that  have  contributed  to  adverse  cumulative  effects 
to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources:  HGS,  SGS,  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station,  and 
Limerick  Generating  Station.  The  Salem  County  Solid  Waste  Landfill  also  operates  in  this 
region.  These  facilities  are  expected  to  have  continuing  effects  on  terrestrial  and  wetland 
resources  in  the  region  of  interest  during  the  operational  period  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at 
the  PSEG  Site. 

Future  residential  development  and  further  urbanization  of  the  area  would  result  in  the 
continued  increase  in  fragmentation  and  loss  of  habitat.  The  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor 
and  Workforce  Development  projected  that  the  population  of  Salem  County  would  increase  by 
approximately  5  percent  between  2010  and  2030.  The  overall  growth  of  the  geographic  region 
of  interest  is  expected  to  increase  as  well  from  2010  and  2030  (NJLWD  2014-TN3332).  Future 
urbanization  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest  could  result  in  further  losses  of  agricultural 
lands,  wetlands,  and  forested  areas.  Urbanization  would  reduce  area  in  natural  vegetation  and 
open  space  and  would  decrease  connectivity  among  wetlands,  forests,  and  other  wildlife 
habitat.  The  loss  of  habitats  as  a  result  of  urbanization  would  result  in  added  pressures  to  the 
remaining  habitat  available  for  wildlife  populations.  However,  it  is  not  expected  that  these 
activities  would  substantially  affect  the  overall  availability  of  wildlife  habitat  or  travel  corridors 
near  the  geographic  region  of  interest. 

Some  of  the  projects  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest  include  site  redevelopment,  including 
redevelopment  resulting  from  a  base  realignment  and  closure  for  Camp  Pedricktown, 

Shieldalloy  site  decommissioning,  Gateway  Business  Park,  and  the  Millville  Municipal  Airport. 
The  Camp  Pedricktown  redevelopment  and  Shieldalloy  facility  are  currently  developed/disturbed 
sites.  In  addition,  the  Gateway  Business  Park  in  Oldmans  Township,  Salem  County,  is  a  light 
industrial  complex  consisting  of  284  ac.  The  business  park  is  planning  to  develop  three  sites 
with  approximately  25  ac.  The  site  is  mostly  developed  with  little  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat 
available  (Matrix  Development  Group  2008-TN3273).  The  proposed  Millville  Municipal  Airport 
improvements  would  refurbish  the  apron  terminal  at  the  airport.  These  projects  are  not 
expected  to  further  degrade  or  fragment  terrestrial  and  wetland  ecology  resources  within  the 
geographic  region  of  interest. 

The  transmission  service  provider  has  determined  that  a  new  transmission  line  and  ROW  are 
needed  to  support  grid  stability  in  the  geographic  region  of  interest.  The  new  transmission  line 
and  ROW  are  not  dependent  on  whether  PSEG  builds  and  operates  a  new  nuclear  power  plant 
on  the  PSEG  Site.  In  its  environmental  report,  PSEG  conducted  a  study  of  a  hypothetical  5-mi 
wide  macro-corridor  known  as  the  West  Macro-Corridor  and  transmission  line  ROW  that 
extends  55  mi  from  the  PSEG  Site  to  Peach  Bottom  Substation  in  Pennsylvania.  The 
transmission  line  ROW  within  the  corridor  is  expected  to  be  200  ft  wide.  The  development  of 
the  transmission  line  corridor  would  cause  disturbances  to  over  1 ,500  ac  of  land.  Habitats  that 


NUREG-2168 


F.  3. 3-76 

F-322 


November  201 5 


Appendix  F 


could  be  affected  include  barren  land,  deciduous  forests,  evergreen  forests,  mixed  forest, 
agricultural  land,  woody  wetlands,  and  emergent  wetlands  (PSEG  2015-TN4280).  The  corridor 
would  be  expected  to  follow  existing  ROWs  to  the  extent  practicable.  However,  the  exact 
amounts  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  habitat  that  would  be  affected  are  not  known,  and  it  is 
expected  that  the  project  would  cause  fragmentation  and  degradation  of  these  resources.  The 
amount  of  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  affected  by  the  grid  stability  line  would  not  be  a 
significant  amount  of  the  available  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  in  the  region,  but  mitigation 
may  be  required. 

Parks  and  wildlife  management  areas  located  in  the  region  of  interest  include  Supawna 
Meadows  National  Wildlife  Refuge,  Fort  Mott  State  Park,  Parvin  State  Park,  and  Mad  Horse 
Creek  WMA.  These  areas  would  not  be  expected  to  add  cumulative  impacts  to  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  and  may  be  affected  by  regional  development.  Habitats  available  in  this 
region  potentially  could  become  overburdened  with  species  fleeing  areas  being  developed.  The 
Supawna  Meadows  National  Wildlife  Refuge  35  miles  south  of  Philadelphia.  Pennsylvania,  in 
Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  is  recognized  as  a  wetlands  of  international  importance 
(FWS  201 3-TN2530).  The  refuge  covers  approximately  3,000  ac  and  is  an  important  refuge  for 
migratory  birds.  Fort  Mott  State  Park  in  Salem  County,  New  Jersey,  is  a  124-ac  facility  and  was 
part  of  the  coastal  defense  system  for  the  Delaware  River  (NJDEP  201 3-TN2532).  It  provides 
open  field  and  shoreline  habitats  as  well  as  recreational  activities  such  as  fishing.  Parvin  State 
Park  is  a  2,092-ac  facility  on  the  edge  of  the  Pine  Barrens  and  contains  coniferous  and 
deciduous  forest,  open  water,  and  wetland  habitats  (NJDEP  2013-TN2531).  Parvin  State  Park 
allows  fishing,  hunting,  and  other  recreational  activities.  The  proposed  Mad  Horse  Creek 
project  will  restore  nearly  200  ac  of  the  WMA  to  address  injuries  to  the  shoreline  and  bird 
resources  resulting  from  the  2004  Athos  I  oil  spill.  NJDEP  and  the  National  Oceanic  and 
Atmospheric  Administration  are  proposing  a  tidal  wetlands  restoration  project  that  allows  for  the 
restoration  of  Spartina  alterniflora  habitat  (NOAA  2008-TN2721).  Any  unavoidable  impacts  to 
wetlands  resulting  from  the  construction  of  the  new  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  vicinity  could  be 
further  mitigated  by  this  restoration  project.  Sensitive  wildlife  species  that  use  marsh  habitats 
(e.g.,  bald  eagle  [Haliaeetus  leucocephalus ]  for  foraging,  northern  harrier  [Circus  cyaneus], 
osprey  [Pandion  haliaetus])  will  be  positively  affected  by  this  restoration  effort.  These  activities 
also  potentially  could  improve  habitat  for  the  bog  turtle. 

5.2  Salt  Drift,  Icing,  Fogging,  and  Increased  Precipitation 

Limerick  Generating  Station,  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station,  and  HCGS  use  cooling 
towers  as  part  of  their  cooling  system.  These  cooling  systems  have  the  potential  to  affect 
terrestrial  or  wetland  resources  in  the  region  as  a  result  of  salt  drift,  icing,  fogging,  and 
increased  precipitation  (NRC  2013-TN2654).  Peach  Bottom  Atomic  Power  Station  uses  MDCT, 
and  both  the  Limerick  Generating  Station  and  HCGS  use  NDCT.  Salt  drift  deposition  rates  are 
highest  with  MDCT  but  are  dispersed  further  with  NDCT.  However,  most  of  the  effects  of  salt 
deposition  on  vegetation  would  be  localized  to  the  towers.  No  adverse  impacts  to  terrestrial  or 
wetland  resources  from  fogging,  icing,  and  increased  precipitation  would  be  expected  as  a 
result  of  operating  cooling  systems.  The  effects  of  salt  drift,  icing,  fogging,  and  increased 
precipitation  from  the  proposed  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site  were  evaluated  and 
found  to  have  a  negligible  effect  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.

5.3  Climate  Change 

The  “Global  Climate  Change  Impacts  in  the  United  States”  report,  provided  by  the  U.S.  Global 
Change  Research  Program  (GCRP),  summarizes  the  projected  impacts  of  future  climate 
changes  in  the  United  States.  The  report  divides  the  United  States  into  nine  regions,  with  the 
PSEG  Site  located  in  the  Northeast  region.  The  GCRP  climate  models  for  this  region  project 
temperatures  to  rise  2.5  to  4°F  in  the  winter  and  1 .5  to  3.5°F  in  the  summer  over  the  next 
several  decades.  Winters  are  projected  to  be  much  shorter  with  fewer  cold  days  and  more 
precipitation.  Cities  that  currently  experience  few  days  above  100°F  each  summer  would 
average  20  or  more  days.  Hot  summer  conditions  would  come  three  weeks  earlier  and  last 
three  additional  weeks  into  the  fall.  Sea  level  is  projected  to  rise  more  than  the  global  average, 
with  more  frequent  severe  flooding  and  heavy  downpours.  These  projected  changes  potentially 
could  alter  wildlife  habitat  and  the  composition  of  wildlife  populations.  Large-scale  shifts  in  the 
ranges  of  wildlife  species  and  the  timing  of  seasons  and  animal  migration  that  are  already 
occurring  are  very  likely  to  continue  (GCRP  2014-TN3472). 

5.4  Summary  of  Cumulative  Effects 

The  potential  cumulative  effects  to  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  from  the  construction  and 
operation  of  a  new  nuclear  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site,  in  combination  with  the  other  activities 
described  above,  would  noticeably  alter  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources.  These  activities  will 
result  in  the  loss  or  modification  of  terrestrial  habitats  and  wetlands,  which  potentially  could 
affect  important  species  that  live  or  migrate  through  the  area.  Therefore,  the  incremental 
contribution  of  the  building  and  operation  of  the  new  nuclear  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  to 
cumulative  effects  would  be  noticeable  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  ESP  site. 

Although  the  PSEG  Site  does  not  contain  suitable  habitat  for  the  Federally  threatened  northern 
long-eared  bat  or  the  Federally  threatened  (State-listed)  rufa  red  knot,  potential  offsite 
transmission  lines  along  with  other  actions  taken  in  the  geographical  area  of  interest  could  result 
in  potential  effects  to  these  species. 

The  extent  of  potential  cumulative  effects  on  the  northern  long-eared  bat  and  rufa  red  knot 
would  be  dependent  upon  the  extent  of  BMPs  taken  with  the  implementation  of  the  various 
projects  in  the  geographical  area  of  interest.  Mitigation  or  avoidance  of  sensitive  habitat  would 
be  an  important  factor  in  determining  the  extent  of  potential  effects. 

The  proposed  new  transmission  lines  to  support  grid  stability  have  the  potential  to  cross 
approximately  560  ac  of  freshwater  woody  and  emergent  wetlands  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280). 

The  addition  of  the  new  transmission  corridor  potentially  could  cross  over  14  miles  of  streams. 
Additionally,  future  urbanization  could  result  in  some  limited  losses  of  wetlands  and  streams. 
State  and/or  Federal  regulations  would  require  mitigation  to  protect  wetlands  and  streams  from 
future  ROW  development  and  urbanization.  However,  the  cumulative  effects  to  terrestrial  and 
wetland  resources  from  these  activities  and  a  future  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site 
would  be  noticeable  in  the  vicinity  of  the  PSEG  ESP  site. 

Potential  cumulative  effects  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  for  the  site  vicinity  would  result 
from  loss  of  vegetation  as  well  as  loss  and  fragmentation  of  wildlife  habitat.  Such  effects  will 


NUREG-21 68 


F. 3. 3-78 


November  201 5 


F-324 


Appendix  F 


increase  with  the  continued  development  of  the  geographical  area  of  interest,  with  potential 
impacts  to  northern  long-eared  bat  and  rufa  red  knot  habitat.  Overall,  when  combined  with 
other  past,  present,  and  reasonably  foreseeable  future  actions,  the  cumulative  effects  to 
terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  resulting  from  the  building  and  operation  of  the  new  plant  on 
the  PSEG  Site  and  the  proposed  causeway  would  be  noticeable  but  would  not  be  expected  to 
cause  significant  overall  wildlife  species  population  or  ecosystem  impacts  within  the  6-mi 
vicinity.  Because  of  the  presence  of  extensive  similar  habitat  in  the  geographic  region  of 
interest,  potential  cumulative  effects  on  terrestrial  and  wetland  resources  within  this  region 
would  be  expected  to  be  minimal. 

6.0  CONCLUSIONS  AND  DETERMINATION  OF  EFFECTS 

Building  activities  would  affect  terrestrial  habitats  on  the  PSEG  Site.  However,  hibernacula, 
maternity  roost,  and  foraging  habitat  for  the  northern  long-eared  bat  do  not  exist  on  the  PSEG 
Site,  and  building  activities  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  have  no  effect  on 
this  species.  The  PSEG  Site  does  not  contain  suitable  habitat  or  forage  for  the  rufa  red  knot, 
and  building  activities  associated  with  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  would  have  no  effect  on  this 
species.  In  addition,  PSEG  is  developing  a  wetland  mitigation  plan  to  compensate  for  the  loss 
of  wetlands  and  other  aquatic  resources  resulting  from  the  proposed  project.  This  plan  would 
require  approval  through  the  Department  of  the  Army  permit  application  submitted  to  the 
USACE,  Philadelphia  District. 

Potential  impacts  to  the  northern  long-eared  bat  and  rufa  red  knot  from  operation  of  the  new 
nuclear  power  plant  would  be  associated  mainly  with  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  with 
human-made  structures  on  the  site.  However,  bat  and  bird  mortality  as  a  result  of  collisions  is 
not  known  to  affect  overall  bat  or  bird  populations.  Additionally,  northern-long-eared  bats  and 
rufa  red  knots  are  not  known  to  occur  on  the  PSEG  Site  and  suitable  habitat  does  not  exist  on 
the  site  for  either  species. 

The  PSEG  Site  does  not  appear  to  provide  suitable  habitat  requirements  to  sustain  the  northern 
long-eared  bat  or  the  rufa  red  knot.  Therefore,  habitat  disturbed  or  lost  because  of  the 
construction  of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  should  not  affect  these  species. 
Therefore,  the  review  team  has  determined  that  building  and  operation  activities  associated  with 
a  potential  new  nuclear  power  plant  on  the  PSEG  Site  would  have  no  adverse  effects  on  the 
Federally  threatened  northern  long-eared  bat  or  Federally  threatened  rufa  red  knot.

APPENDIX  G 


SUPPORTING  INFORMATION  AND  DATA:  POPULATION 
PROJECTIONS  AND  RADIOLOGICAL  DOSE  ASSESSMENT 


G.1  Population  Projections 

Table  G-1  provides  resident  population  distribution  and  projections  through  the  year  2081  for 
the  area  within  50  mi  of  the  PSEG  Power,  LLC  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  Site. 

Table  G-2  provides  transient  population  distribution  and  projections  through  the  year  2081  for 
the  area  within  10  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site.  PSEG  obtained  population  estimates  from  various 
sources,  including  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  (USCB)  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283).  PSEG  used  the 
estimates  to  develop  population  projections  for  the  year  2010,  the  expected  first  year  of 
operation  for  the  new  plant  (i.e. ,  2021),  and  10-year  increments  over  the  potential  operating  life 
of  the  new  plant  (through  2081)  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

Based  on  the  aforementioned  USCB  2000  census  block  data,  Table  G-1  provides  population 
estimates  within  the  concentric  bands  from  0  to  1  mi,  1  to  2  mi,  2  to  3  mi,  3  to  4  mi,  4  to  5  mi,  5 
to  10  mi,  10  to  20  mi,  20  to  30  mi,  30  to  40  mi,  and  40  to  50  mi  for  each  of  the  16  directional 
sectors,  with  each  directional  sector  consisting  of  22.5  degrees.  For  each  segment  formed  by  a 
distance  band  and  directional  sector,  the  percentage  of  each  census  block’s  land  area  that  fell, 
either  completely  or  partially,  within  that  segment  is  calculated  using  geographic  information 
system  (GIS)  software  ArcMap9.2  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The  equivalent  proportion  of  each 
census  block’s  population  is  then  assigned  to  each  segment.  If  portions  of  two  or  more  census 
blocks  fall  within  the  same  segment,  the  proportional  population  estimates  for  each  census 
block  are  summed  to  obtain  the  population  estimate  for  that  segment  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

The  GIS  baseline,  which  includes  the  population  estimates  distributed  by  segment,  is  used  to 
develop  projections  of  future  populations  (Table  G-1).  The  2010  populations  are  projected  by 
using  USCB  growth  rates  for  the  2000  through  2008  period  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  From  2010 
onward,  population  growth  rates  are  derived  from  county  population  projections  developed  by 
the  states  of  Delaware,  Maryland,  New  Jersey,  and  Pennsylvania  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  New 
Jersey  has  published  population  projections  out  to  2025,  while  Delaware,  Maryland,  and 
Pennsylvania  have  published  population  projections  out  to  2030  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  The 
county  population  growth  rates  derived  from  these  projections  are  used  to  extrapolate  the 
baseline  2010  projections  out  to  2021  and  2031  for  appropriate  counties  within  each  of  the  four 
states.  No  official  published  data  were  found  that  could  be  applied  beyond  the  2031  projections 
(PSEG  2015-TN4283).  Population  projections  beyond  2031  are  based  on  the  county-specific 
annual  growth  rate  calculated  for  each  county  between  2021  and  2031.  The  county-specific 
growth  rates  for  this  10-year  period  are  used  to  obtain  the  population  projections  for  each 
successive  10-year  period  (i.e.,  2041,  2051,  2061, 2071,  and  2081)  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).

In  addition  to  the  permanent  residents  within  10  mi  of  the  PSEG  Site,  there  are  people  that  enter 
this  area  on  a  regular  basis  for  employment,  education  (e.g.,  schools  and  daycare  facilities), 
recreation  (e.g.,  parks,  wildlife  areas,  resorts,  beaches,  and  associated  lodging  and 
restaurants),  and  medical  care  (e.g.,  hospitals  and  assisted  living  centers)  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4283).  The  transient  population  data  in  Table  G-2  are  based  primarily  on  2009  surveys 
conducted  by  KLD  Engineering  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).  These  data  assume  that  transient 
populations  increase  at  the  same  rate  as  resident  populations  (PSEG  2015-TN4283). 

G.2  Supporting  Documentation  on  Radiological  Dose  Assessment 

The  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC)  staff  reviewed  and  performed  an  independent 
dose  assessment  of  the  radiological  impacts  from  normal  operation  of  new  and  existing  nuclear 
units  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  results  of  the  assessment  are  presented  in  this  appendix  and  are 
compared  to  the  results  from  PSEG’s  assessment  found  in  Section  5.9.  Radiological  Impacts  of 
Normal  Operations.  The  appendix  is  divided  into  four  sections:  (1)  dose  estimates  to  the  public 
from  liquid  effluents,  (2)  dose  estimates  to  the  public  from  gaseous  effluents,  (3)  cumulative 
dose  estimates,  and  (4)  dose  estimates  to  the  biota  from  gaseous  and  liquid  effluents. 

G.2.1  Dose  Estimates  to  the  Public  from  Liquid  Effluents 

The  NRC  staff  used  the  dose  assessment  approach  specified  in  Regulatory  Guide  1.109 
(NRC  1977-TN90)  and  the  LADTAP  II  computer  code  (Strenge  et  al.  1986-TN82)  to  estimate 
doses  to  the  maximally  exposed  individual  (MEI)  and  population  from  the  liquid  effluent  pathway 
of  a  new  nuclear  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  The  NRC  staff  used  the  projected  radioactive  effluent 
release  values  for  Salem  Generating  Station  (SGS)  Units  1  and  2  and  Hope  Creek  Generating 
Station  (HCGS)  Unit  1  to  estimate  doses  to  the  MEI  and  population  from  liquid  effluent  releases 
from  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  The  NRC  staff  used  the  projected  radioactive  effluents  release 
values  from  the  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report  (SSAR)  (PSEG  2015-TN4283).

Appendix  G 


G.2.1.1  Scope 

Doses  from  to  the  MEI  were  calculated  and  compared  to  regulatory  criteria  for  the  following: 

•  Total  Body — Dose  was  the  total  for  all  pathways  (i.e.,  ingestion  of  aquatic  organisms  as  food 
and  recreational  activity  on  and  near  the  Delaware  River)  with  the  highest  value  for  either 
the  adult,  teen,  child,  or  infant  compared  to  the  3  mrem/yr  per  reactor  design  objective  in 
Title  10  of  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  50,  Appendix  1(10  CFR  Part  50- 
TN249). 

•  Organ — Dose  was  the  total  for  each  organ  for  all  pathways  (i.e.,  ingestion  of  aquatic 
organisms  as  food  and  recreational  activity  on  and  near  the  Delaware  River)  with  the 
highest  value  for  the  adult,  teen,  child,  or  infant  compared  to  the  10  mrem/yr  per  reactor 
design  objective  specified  in  10  CFR  Part  50,  Appendix  I  (TN249). 

The  NRC  staff  reviewed  the  assumed  exposure  pathways  and  the  input  parameters  and  values 
used  by  PSEG  (PSEG  2015-TN4280;  PSEG  2015-TN4283)  for  appropriateness,  including 
references  made  to  the  API  000  (Westinghouse  201 1 -TN261 ).  Default  values  from  Regulatory 
Guide  1.109  (NRC  1977-TN90)  were  used  when  input  parameters  were  not  available.  The  NRC 
staff  concluded  that  the  assumed  exposure  pathways  were  appropriate;  drinking  water 
withdrawal  from  the  Delaware  River  does  not  occur  downstream  of  the  site.  In  addition,  the 
input  parameters  and  values  used  by  PSEG  were  generally  appropriate. 

G.2.1.2  Resources  Used 

To  calculate  doses  to  the  public  from  liquid  effluents,  the  NRC  staff  used  a  personal  computer 
version  of  the  LADTAP  II  code  titled  NRCDOSE,  Version  2.3.15  (CNS  2006-TN102),  obtained 
through  the  Oak  Ridge  Radiation  Safety  Information  Computational  Center  (RSICC)  with 
updates  to  the  user  interface  obtained  directly  from  Chesapeake  Nuclear  Services. 

G.2.1.3  Input  Parameters 

Table  G-3  provides  a  listing  of  the  major  parameters  used  in  calculating  dose  to  the  public  from 
liquid  effluent  releases  during  normal  operation. 

G.2.1.4  Comparison  of  Results 

The  results  documented  in  the  PSEG  environmental  report  (ER)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and 
SSAR  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  for  doses  from  liquid  effluent  releases  are  compared  in  Table  G-4 
with  the  results  calculated  by  the  NRC  staff.  The  doses  calculated  by  the  NRC  staff  are  in 
agreement  with  doses  calculated  by  PSEG.  For  calculating  the  population  dose  from  liquid 
effluents,  PSEG  used  the  population  distribution  for  2036.  However,  Section  5.4.1  of  the  NRC’s 
Environmental  Standard  Review  Plan  (ESRP)  (NRC  2000-TN614)  requires  use  of  “projected 
population  for  5  years  from  the  time  of  the  licensing  action  under  consideration.”  Because  the 
population  is  increasing,  the  use  of  the  year  2036  is  conservative  as  long  as  operations  at  the 
site  begin  before  then,  so  the  NRC  staff  also  used  the  year  2036  for  comparisons.

G.2.2  Dose  Estimates  to  the  Public  from  Gaseous  Effluents 

The  NRC  staff  used  the  dose  assessment  approach  specified  in  Regulatory  Guide  1.109 
(NRC  1977-TN90),  and  the  XOQDOQ  and  GASPAR  II  computer  code  (Sagendorf  et  al.  1982- 
TN280;  Strenge  et  al.  1987-TN83)  to  estimate  doses  to  the  MEI  and  to  the  population  within  an 
80-km  (50-mi)  radius  of  the  PSEG  Site  from  the  gaseous  effluent  pathway  for  the  new  nuclear 
power  plant.  The  NRC  staff  used  the  projected  radioactive  gaseous  effluents  release  values 
from  the  SSAR  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283). 

G.2.2. 7  Scope 

The  NRC  staff  and  PSEG  calculated  the  MEI  dose  at  2.8  mi  northwest  (NW)  of  a  new  nuclear 
power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site.  Pathways  included  were  plume,  ground,  inhalation,  and 
ingestion  of  locally  grown  meat,  milk,  and  vegetables.  The  NRC  staff  reviewed  the  parameters 
and  values  used  by  PSEG  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  for  appropriateness,  including  references  to 
the  API  000  Design  Control  Document  (Westinghouse  201 1 -TN261 ).  Default  values  from 
Regulatory  Guide  1.109  (NRC  1977-TN90)  were  used  when  site-specific  input  parameters  were 
not  available.  The  NRC  staff  concluded  that  the  assumed  exposure  pathways  and  input 
parameters  were  appropriate.  These  pathways  and  parameters  were  used  by  the  NRC  staff  in 
its  independent  calculations  using  GASPAR  II. 

Joint  frequency  distribution  data  of  wind  speed  and  wind  direction  by  atmospheric  stability  class 
for  the  proposed  site  provided  in  SSAR  Table  2.3-27  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  were  used  as  input 
to  the  XOQDOQ  code  (Sagendorf  et  al.  1982-TN280)  to  calculate  average  atmospheric 
dispersion  factor  (y/Q,  the  annual  average  normalized  air  concentration  value[s])  and 
deposition  factor  (D/Q,  the  annual  normalized  total  surface  concentration  rate[s])  values  for 
routine  releases.  The  NRC  staff  reviewed  the  XOQDOQ  output  files  provided  by  PSEG  and 
concluded  they  are  appropriate  for  use  in  dose  calculations  for  the  gaseous  effluents. 

Population  doses  were  calculated  for  all  types  of  releases  (i.e.,  noble  gases,  particulates, 
iodines,  H-3,  and  C-14)  using  the  GASPAR  II  code  for  the  following:  plume  immersion;  direct 
radiation  from  radionuclides  deposited  on  the  ground;  inhalation;  and  ingestion  of  vegetables, 
milk,  and  meat. 

G.2.2. 2  Resources  Used 

To  calculate  doses  to  the  public  from  gaseous  effluents,  the  NRC  staff  used  a  personal 
computer  version  of  the  XOQDOQ  and  GASPAR  II  codes  titled  NRCDOSE  Version  2.3.1 5 
(CNS  2006-TN102)  obtained  through  the  Oak  Ridge  RSICC  with  updates  to  the  user  interface 
obtained  directly  from  Chesapeake  Nuclear  Services. 

G.  2. 2. 3  Input  Parameters 

Table  G-5  provides  a  listing  of  the  major  parameters  used  in  calculating  dose  to  the  public  from 
gaseous  effluent  releases  during  normal  operation.

The  NRC  staff  compared  results  documented  in  the  SSAR  and  in  PSEG’s  responses  to 
requests  for  information  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  about  doses  from  noble  gases  at  the  site 
boundary  and  the  exclusion  area  boundary  with  the  results  calculated  by  the  NRC  staff.  The 
doses  calculated  by  the  NRC  staff  confirmed  the  doses  calculated  by  PSEG. 


November  2015 


G-13 


NUREG-2168 


Appendix  G 


The  NRC  staff  compared  its  estimates  of  doses  to  the  MEI  calculated  by  PSEG.  Doses  to  the 
MEI  estimated  by  PSEG  were  calculated  by  summing  doses  from  the  maximum  locations  of 
each  exposure  pathway.  The  doses  calculated  by  the  NRC  staff  confirmed  the  doses  calculated 
by  PSEG. 

G.  2. 2. 5  Comparison  of  Results — Population  Doses 

The  NRC  staff  performed  a  comparison  of  the  PSEG  population  dose  estimates  taken  from 
Table  5.4-12  of  the  ER  (PSEG  201 5-TN4280)  with  the  staff  estimates.  The  staffs  independent 
calculation  for  population  dose  yielded  results  that  were  comparable  to  the  PSEG  SSAR 
estimates  (PSEG  2015-TN4283)  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  For  calculating  the  population 
dose  from  gaseous  effluents,  the  population  distribution  used  by  PSEG  and  the  NRC  staff  was 
for  year  2056.  However,  ESRP  Section  5.4.1  (NRC  2000-TN614)  requires  use  of  “projected 
population  for  5  years  from  the  time  of  the  licensing  action  under  consideration.”  Assuming  the 
combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  action  occurs  in  year  2010,  adding  5  years 
yields  year  2015.  Because  the  population  is  increasing,  the  use  of  the  year  2056  is  more 
conservative  than  required  by  the  rule  and  has  been  used  herein.  The  NRC  staff  estimates 
confirmed  the  estimates  by  PSEG  (2015-TN4280)  to  two  significant  digits. 

G.2.3  Cumulative  and  Population  Dose  Estimates 

Based  on  parameters  shown  for  the  liquid  and  gaseous  pathways,  Table  G-3  and  Table  G-5, 
respectively,  the  NRC  staff  compared  the  results  documented  in  the  ER  (PSEG  2015-TN4280) 
for  cumulative  dose  estimates  to  the  MEI  with  those  calculated  by  the  NRC  staff.  Cumulative 
dose  estimates  include  doses  from  all  pathways  (i.e. ,  direct  exposure,  liquid  effluents,  and 
gaseous  effluents)  for  a  new  nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  as  well  as  the  existing  SGS 
and  HCGS  units.  These  cumulative  dose  estimates  were  calculated  for  comparison  to  the  dose 
standards  of  40  CFR  Part  1 90  (TN739).  The  NRC  staffs  calculations  for  cumulative  dose 
confirmed  the  PSEG  estimates  (PSEG  2015-TN4280)  and  are  shown  in  Table  G-6.

G.2.4  Dose  Estimates  to  the  Nonhuman  Biota  from  Liquid  and  Gaseous  Effluents 

The  NRC  staff  performed  confirmatory  calculations  of  the  doses  to  biota  from  liquid  and 
gaseous  effluents  using  the  LADTAP  II  (Strenge  et  al.  1986-TN82)  and  GASPAR  II  (Strenge  et 
al.  1987-TN83).  The  NRC  staff  used  a  personal  computer  version  of  the  LADTAP  II  code  and 
GASPAR  II  code  titled  NRCDOSE  Version  2.3.15  (CNS  2006-TN102)  obtained  through  the  Oak 
Ridge  RSICC.

G.  2. 4. 7  Liquid  Effluent  Pathways 

The  NRC  estimated  doses  to  biota  from  liquid  effluents  using  fish,  invertebrates,  and  algae  as 
surrogate  aquatic  biota  species.  Muskrats,  raccoons,  herons,  and  ducks  are  used  as  surrogate 
terrestrial  biota  species.  The  NRC  staff  recognizes  the  LADTAP  II  computer  program  as  an 
appropriate  method  for  calculating  dose  to  the  aquatic  biota  and  for  calculating  the  liquid 
pathway  contribution  to  terrestrial  biota.  Most  of  the  LADTAP  II  input  parameters  are  specified 
in  Section  G.2.1.3.  The  NRC  staffs  dose  analysis  confirmed  the  liquid  pathway  doses  to  biota 
estimated  by  PSEG. 

G.  2. 4. 2  Gaseous  Effluent  Pathways 

The  NRC  staff  assessed  doses  to  terrestrial  biota  from  the  gaseous  effluent  pathway  based  on 
the  results  of  the  GASPAR  II  calculations  for  human  doses  discussed  in  Section  G.2.2.  Again, 
muskrats,  raccoons,  herons,  and  ducks  are  used  as  surrogate  terrestrial  biota  species.  The 
NRC  staff  assessed  the  doses  at  the  site  boundary  (0.24  mi  ENE)  to  achieve  a  reasonable 
estimate  of  the  doses  to  terrestrial  biota  that  might  live  on  the  PSEG  Site.  It  was  assumed  that 
doses  for  raccoons  and  ducks  were  equivalent  to  adult  human  doses  for  inhalation,  vegetation 
ingestion,  and  the  plume.  The  dose  from  ground  exposure  was  doubled.  The  doubling  of  doses 
from  ground  deposition  reflects  the  closer  proximity  of  these  organisms  to  the  ground.  Muskrats 
and  herons  do  not  consume  terrestrial  vegetation,  so  that  pathway  was  not  included  for  these 
organisms.  The  NRC  staffs  dose  assessment  confirmed  the  gaseous  pathway  doses  to  biota 
estimated  by  PSEG  as  shown  in  Table  5-19  of  this  EIS.

APPENDIX  I 


PSEG  SITE  CHARACTERISTICS  AND  PLANT 
PARAMETER  ENVELOPE  VALUES 


The  specific  early  site  permit  (ESP)  site  characteristics  and  plant  parameter  envelope  (PPE) 
values  used  in  this  document  are  from  Chapter  3  of  the  Environmental  Report  (PSEG  2015- 
TN4280)  and  Tables  1 .3-1  and  2.0-1  of  the  Site  Safety  Analysis  Report  (PSEG  201 5-TN4283) 
unless  otherwise  specified.  The  review  team  used  these  characteristics  and  values  in  its 
independent  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed  new  plant.  In  some 
cases,  as  noted,  the  review  team  substituted  values  based  on  its  own  analysis.  The  ESP  site 
characteristics  and  PPE  values  used  in  the  review  team’s  evaluation  are  presented  in  Table  1-1 
and  Table  1-2,  respectively.

APPENDIX  J 


PSEG  REPRESENTATIONS  AND  ASSUMPTIONS 


APPENDIX  J 


PSEG  REPRESENTATIONS  AND  ASSUMPTIONS 


If  an  early  site  permit  (ESP)  for  the  PSEG  Power,  LLC  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG)  Site  is 
issued  and  an  applicant  references  that  ESP  in  a  subsequent  application  for  a  construction 
permit  (CP)  or  a  combined  construction  permit  and  operating  license  (COL),  the  applicant  would 
have  to  demonstrate  that  the  design  selected  for  the  site  falls  within  the  bounds  of  the  Nuclear 
Regulatory  Commission’s  (NRC’s)  ESP  analysis  in  this  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS). 
With  regard  to  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  construction  and  operation  of  a  new 
nuclear  power  plant  at  the  PSEG  Site,  PSEG  made  a  number  of  representations  in  its 
application.  As  listed  in  this  appendix,  the  staff  used  these  representations  and  staff-developed 
assumptions  in  assessing  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  construction  and  operation 
of  a  new  nuclear  power  plant.  As  such,  fulfillment  of  these  representations  and  assumptions 
provides  part  of  the  basis  for  the  final  impact  assessment.  Should  a  CP  or  COL  applicant 
reference  the  ESP,  and  the  staff  ultimately  determines  that  a  representation  or  assumption  has 
not  been  satisfied  at  the  CP/COL  stage,  that  information  would  be  considered  new  and 
potentially  significant,  and  the  affected  impact  area  could  be  subject  to  re-examination. 

Table  J-1  references  PSEG’s  representations  and  the  NRC  staffs  assumptions  in  this  EIS  about 
design  (Appendix  I);  authorizations,  permits,  and  certifications  (Appendix  H);  and  mitigation 
(Sections  4.1 1  and  5.12).  Table  J-2  contains  references  to  representations  and  assumptions 
organized  by  technical  area,  without  repeating  the  information  in  Table  J-1. 

Within  the  Environmental  Report  (ER)  (PSEG  2015-TN4280),  PSEG  provides: 

1 .  representations  to  address  certain  issues  in  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  the 
facility; 

2.  representations  of  planned  compliance  with  current  laws,  regulations,  and  requirements; 

3.  representations  of  future  activities  and  actions  that  it  would  take  should  it  receive  an  ESP 
and  decide  to  apply  for  a  COL  for  the  PSEG  Site;  and 

4.  representations  of  PSEG’s  estimates  of  future  activities  and  actions  of  others  and  the  likely 
environmental  impacts  of  those  activities  and  actions  that  would  be  expected  should  PSEG 
decide  to  apply  for  a  CP  or  COL. 

The  following  tables  are  meant  to  aid  the  staff  and  the  applicant  in  the  event  this  EIS  is 
referenced  in  a  CP  or  COL  application.  The  tables  are  not  meant  to  replace  the  analyses  in  the 
EIS.

GREENHOUSE  GAS  FOOTPRINT  ESTIMATES  FOR  A  REFERENCE 
1 ,000-MW(E)  LIGHT  WATER  REACTOR  (LWR) 


APPENDIX  K 


GREENHOUSE  GAS  FOOTPRINT  ESTIMATES  FOR  A  REFERENCE 
1,000-MW(E)  LIGHT  WATER  REACTOR  (LWR) 


The  review  team  has  estimated  the  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  footprint  of  various  activities 
associated  with  nuclear  power  plants.  These  activities  include  building,  operating,  and 
decommissioning  a  nuclear  power  plant.  The  estimates  include  direct  emissions  from  the 
nuclear  facility  and  indirect  emissions  from  workforce  transportation  and  the  fuel  cycle. 

Preconstruction/construction  equipment  estimates  listed  in  Table  K-1  are  based  on  hours  of 
equipment  use  estimated  for  a  single  nuclear  power  plant  at  a  site  requiring  a  moderate  amount 
of  terrain  modification  (UniStar  2007-TN1564). 

Preconstruction/construction  equipment  carbon  monoxide  (CO)  emission  estimates  were 
derived  from  the  hours  of  equipment  use,  and  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  were  then 
estimated  from  the  CO  emissions  using  a  scaling  factor  of  172  tons  of  CO2  per  ton  of  CO. 

The  scaling  factor  is  based  on  the  ratio  of  CO2  to  CO  emission  factors  for  diesel  fuel  industrial 
engines  as  reported  in  Table  3.3-1  of  AP-42  (EPA  2012-TN2647).  A  C02  to  total  GHG 
equivalency  factor  of  0.991  is  used  to  account  for  the  emissions  from  other  GHGs,  such  as 
methane  (CH4)  and  nitrous  oxide  (N2O).  The  equivalency  factor  is  based  on  non¬ 
road/construction  equipment  (Chapman  et  al.  2012-TN2644).  Equipment  emissions  estimates 
for  decommissioning  are  assumed  to  be  one  half  of  those  for  preconstruction/construction. 

Data  on  equipment  emissions  for  decommissioning  are  not  available;  the  one-half  factor  is 
based  on  the  assumption  that  decommissioning  would  involve  less  earthmoving  and  hauling  of 
material,  as  well  as  fewer  labor  hours,  when  compared  with  preconstruction/construction.

Table  K-2  lists  the  review  team’s  estimates  of  the  CO2  equivalent  (C02e)  emissions  associated 
with  workforce  transportation.  Workforce  estimates  for  new  plant  preconstruction/construction 
are  conservatively  based  on  estimates  in  various  combined  license  applications  (Chapman  et 
al.  2012-TN2644),  and  the  operational  and  decommissioning  workforce  estimates  are  based  on 
Supplement  1  to  NUREG-0586  (NRC  2002-TN665).  The  table  lists  the  assumptions  used  to 
estimate  total  miles  traveled  by  each  workforce  and  the  factors  used  to  convert  total  miles  to 
metric  tons  (MT)  C02e.  The  workers  are  assumed  to  travel  in  gasoline-powered  passenger 
vehicles  (cars,  trucks,  vans,  and  sport  utility  vehicles)  that  get  an  average  of  21 .6  mi  per  gallon 
of  gasoline  (FHWA  2012-TN2645).  Conversion  from  gallons  of  gasoline  burned  to  C02e  is 
based  on  EPA  emission  factors  (EPA  2012-TN2643).

1 0  CFR  51 .51  (a)  (TN250)  states  that  every  environmental  report  prepared  for  the  combined 
license  stage  of  a  light-water-cooled  nuclear  power  reactor  shall  take  Table  S-3  from  10  CFR 
51 .51(b)  (TN250)  as  the  basis  for  evaluating  the  contribution  of  the  environmental  effects  of  the 
uranium  fuel  cycle  in  licensing  the  nuclear  power  reactor.  10  CFR  51.51(a)  (TN250)  further 
states  that  Table  S-3  shall  be  included  in  the  environmental  report  and  may  be  supplemented  by

Appendix  K 


a  discussion  of  the  environmental  significance  of  the  data  set  forth  in  the  table  as  weighted  in 
the  analysis  for  the  proposed  facility. 

Table  S-3  does  not  provide  an  estimate  of  GHG  emissions  associated  with  the  uranium  fuel 
cycle;  it  only  addresses  pollutants  that  were  of  concern  when  the  table  was  promulgated  in  the 
1980s.  However,  Table  S-3  states  that  323,000  MWh  is  the  assumed  annual  electric  energy 
use  for  the  reference  1 ,000  MW(e)  nuclear  power  plant  and  that  this  323,000  MWh  of  annual 
electric  energy  is  assumed  to  be  generated  by  a  45  MW(e)  coal-fired  power  plant  burning 
1 18,000  MT  of  coal.  Table  S-3  also  assumes  that  approximately  135,000,000  standard  cubic 
feet  (scf)  of  natural  gas  is  required  per  year  to  generate  process  heat  for  certain  portions  of  the 
uranium  fuel  cycle.  The  review  team  estimates  that  burning  1 18,000  MT  of  coal  and 
135,000,000  scf  of  natural  gas  per  year  results  in  approximately  253,000  MT  of  C02e  being 
emitted  into  the  atmosphere  per  year  because  of  the  uranium  fuel  cycle  (Harvey  201 3-TN2646). 

The  review  team  estimated  GHG  emissions  related  to  plant  operations  from  a  typical  usage  of 
various  onsite  diesel  generators  (UniStar  2007-TN1564).  Carbon  monoxide  emission  estimates 
were  derived  assuming  an  average  of  600  hours  of  emergency  diesel  generator  operation  per 
year  (four  generators,  each  operating  150  hr/yr)  and  200  hours  of  station  blackout  diesel 
generator  operation  per  year  (two  generators,  each  operating  100  hr/yr).  A  scaling  factor  of  172 
was  then  applied  to  convert  the  CO  emissions  to  CO2  emissions,  and  a  CO2  to  total  GHG 
equivalency  factor  of  0.991  was  used  to  account  for  the  emissions  from  other  GHGs  such  as 
methane  (CH4)  and  nitrous  oxide  (N20). 

Given  the  various  sources  of  GHG  emissions  discussed  above,  the  review  team  estimates  the 
total  life-cycle  GHG  footprint  for  a  reference  1,000  MW(e)  nuclear  power  plant  with  an 
80  percent  capacity  factor  to  be  about  1 0,500,000  MT.  The  components  of  the  footprint  are 
summarized  in  Table  K-3.  The  uranium  fuel  cycle  component  of  the  footprint  dominates  all 
other  components.  It  is  directly  related  to  power  generated.  As  a  result,  it  is  reasonable  to  use 
reactor  power  to  scale  the  footprint  to  larger  reactors.

The  IPCC  released  a  special  report  on  renewable  energy  sources  and  climate  change  mitigation 
in  2012  (IPCC  2012-TN2648).  Annex  II  of  the  IPCC  report  includes  an  assessment  of 


November  2015 


K-3 


NUREG-2168 


Appendix  K 


previously  published  works  on  life-cycle  GHG  emissions  from  various  electric  generation 
technologies,  including  nuclear  energy.  The  IPCC  report  included  in  its  assessment  only 
material  that  passes  certain  screening  criteria  for  quality  and  relevance.  The  IPCC  screening 
yielded  125  estimates  of  nuclear  energy  life-cycle  GHG  emissions  from  32  separate  references. 
The  IPCC-screened  estimates  of  the  life-cycle  GHG  emissions  associated  with  nuclear  energy, 
as  shown  in  Table  A. II. 4  of  the  report,  ranged  more  than  two  orders  of  magnitude,  from 
1  to  220  grams  (g)  of  C02e  per  kWh,  with  25th  percentile,  50th  percentile,  and  75th  percentile 
values  of  8  g  C02e/kWh,  16  g  CC>2e/kWh,  and  45  g  C02e/kWh,  respectively.  The  range  of  the 
IPCC  estimates  is  due,  in  part,  to  assumptions  regarding  the  type  of  enrichment  technology 
employed,  how  the  electricity  used  for  enrichment  is  generated,  the  grade  of  mined  uranium  ore, 
the  degree  of  processing  and  enrichment  required,  and  the  assumed  operating  lifetime  of  a 
nuclear  power  plant. 

The  review  team’s  life-cycle  GHG  estimate  of  approximately  1 0,500,000  MT  C02e  for  the 
reference  1,000  MW(e)  nuclear  plant  is  equal  to  about  37.5  g  C02e/kWh,  which  places  the 
review  team  estimate  between  the  50th  and  75th  percentile  values  of  the  IPCC  estimates  in 
Table  A. 11.4  of  the  report. 

In  closing,  the  review  team  considers  the  footprint  estimated  in  Table  K-3  to  be  appropriately 
conservative.  The  GHG  emissions  estimates  for  the  dominant  component  (uranium  fuel  cycle) 
are  based  on  30-year-old  enrichment  technology,  assuming  that  the  energy  required  for 
enrichment  is  provided  by  coal-fired  generation.  Different  assumptions  related  to  the  source  of 
energy  used  for  enrichment  or  the  enrichment  technology  that  would  be  just  as  reasonable 
could  lead  to  a  significantly  reduced  footprint. 

Emissions  estimates  presented  in  this  EIS  have  been  scaled  to  values  that  are  appropriate  for 
the  proposed  project.  The  uranium  fuel  cycle  emissions  have  been  scaled  by  reactor  power  and 
plant  capacity  factor  using  the  scaling  factor  determined  in  Chapter  6  and  by  the  number  of 
reactors  to  be  built.  Plant  operations  emissions  have  been  adjusted  to  represent  the  number  of 
large  GHG  emissions  sources  (diesel  generators,  boilers,  etc.)  associated  with  the  project.  The 
workforce  emissions  estimates  have  been  scaled  to  account  for  differences  in  workforce 
numbers  and  commuting  distance.  Finally,  equipment  emissions  estimates  have  been  scaled 
by  estimated  equipment  usage.  As  can  be  seen  in  Table  K-3,  only  the  scaling  of  the  uranium 
fuel-cycle  emissions  estimates  makes  a  significant  difference  in  the  total  carbon  footprint  of  the 
project.

11.  ABSTRACT  (200  worda  or  leaa) 

This  environmental  impact  statement  (HIS)  has  been  prepared  in  response  to  an  application  to  the  U.S.  Nuclear  Regulatory 
Commission  (NRC)  by  PSEG  Power,  LLC,  and  PSEG  Nuclear,  LLC  (PSEG),  for  an  early  site  permit  (ESP).  The  proposed  action 
requested  in  the  PSEG  application  is  the  NRC  issuance  of  an  ESP  for  the  PSEG  Site  located  adjacent  to  the  existing  Hope  Creek  and 
Salem  Generating  Stations. 

This  final  environmental  impact  statement  includes  the  preliminary  analysis  that  evaluates  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  proposed 
action  and  alternatives  to  the  proposed  action  . 

After  considering  the  environmental  aspects  of  the  proposed  NRC  action,  the  NRC  staffs  preliminary  recommendation  to  the 
Commission  is  that  the  ESP  be  issued  as  requested.  The  recommendation  is  based  on  (1)  the  application  submitted  by  PSEG, 
including  Revision  4  of  the  Environmental  Report  (ER),  and  the  PSEG  responses  to  requests  for  additional  information  from  the 
NRC  and  USACE  staffs;  (2)  consultation  with  Federal,  State  Tribal ,  and  local  agencies;  (3)  the  staffs  independent  review;  (4)  the 
staffs  consideration  of  comments  related  to  the  environmental  review  that  were  received  during  the  public  scoping  process  and  the 
public  comment  period  following  the  publication  of  the  draft  EIS;  and  (5)  the  assessments  summarized  in  the  EIS,  including  the 
potential  mitigation  measures  identified  in  the  ER  and  this  EIS.
