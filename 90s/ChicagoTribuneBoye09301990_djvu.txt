Many old coins plunge in value; â€˜super rarities' stay high 

By Roger Boye 

Many old coins continue 
to drop in value de- 
spite an ongoing 
robust market for 
"super rarities." 

In August, certain types of un-
circulated coins slid 1.77 percent 
in value, according to a respected 
price index compiled by the 
hobby newspaper Coin World. 
Since March, the index for so- 
called "mint state 65" uncircu-
lated coins has fallen 6.34 per-
cent. 

"Common-date Morgan [silver] 
dollars continued to lose value as 
did common-date Peace dollars, 
walking Liberty half dollars and 
gold type coins," wrote trends 
editor Keith M. Zaner. The index 
for uncirculated (MS-65) silver 
dollars minted from 1878 to 
1921 dropped nearly 26 percent 
in five months. 

Meanwhile, in the latest 
"glamour sale," a set of U.S. 
gold coins to be auctioned in 
California next month could 
bring a winning bid of more than 
$2 million. All six of the experi-
mental "pattern coins" are dated 
1872.

A major auction company has 
changed the way it reports sales 
results in an attempt to reduce 
market manipulation by coin 
sharks. 

Heritage Numismatic Auctions 
of Dallas will no longer publicize 
the price paid for a coin sold at 
auction if the buyer is the person 
who consigned the coin for sale. 
Heritage also will identify such 
"buy backs" in lists of its auction 
results sent to consigners. 

Some persons bid up prices on 
coins they consign to auction, 
buy them back by submitting the 
winning bids, and then quietly 
sell the coins to unsuspecting in-
vestors using the published auc-
tion results as "proof" the coins 
are worth artificially high prices, 
according to company spokes-
man Rod Downey. 

Auction companies can encour-
age buy backs by charging a flat 
fee for such transactions rather 
than a percentage commission 
based on the gavel price. For ex-
ample, a coin's consigner might 
have to pay only a $100 fee to 
buy back his coin that "sold" at 
auction for $20,000. In a normal 
coin-auction sale, the buyer pays 
a 10 percent commission and the 
seller receives the gavel price less 
10 percent. 

Coin World praised the Heri-
tage action as "major step 
forward and a practice well worth 
emulating."

A centurion graces one side of 
a centennial medallion to be is-
sued by the nation's largest or-
ganization of coin collectors. 

The classic Roman officer is 
depicted as moving into a new 
era armed only with the powers 
of knowledge and enlightenment. 
The 32,000 member American 
Numismatic Association 
celebrates its 100th anniversary 
next year, which will include a 
mid-August convention in subur-
ban Rosemont expected to at-
tract thousands of hobbyists. 

The medal's "tails side" shows 
a series of rings that could indi-
cate the ripples from a coin 
dropped in water. 

To order a medallion in brass, 
silver or gold, call the ANA, toll 
free, at (800) 367-9723. The 
three-inch brass medal costs $42, 
including a holder, presentation 
box and postage; prices of the sil-
ver and gold items will depend 
on the precious-metal market. 

Orders received by Nov. 12 will 
be delivered by Christmas. Also, 
the ANA probably will sell a few 
centennial medallions at the Au-
gust convention. 

The ANA was founded in Chi-
cago and now has headquarters 
in Colorado Springs, Colo.
