Executive  Summary 


Persistence  of  populations  of  bats  may  be 
threatened  by  loss  of  roosting  sites, 
elimination  of  insect  prey,  collision  or 
drowning  hazards  at  sites  where  they 
forage,  drink,  and  mate,  and  a  lack  of 
baseline  information  on  distribution  and 
habitat  use  that  are  available  to  resource 
managers.  However,  in  recent  years, 
concerns  have  shifted  focus  to  White-Nose 
Syndrome  (WNS)  and  wind  turbine 
development.  WNS  resulting  from  the  cold 
adapted  fungus  Pseudogymnoascus 
destructans  has  killed  an  estimated  5.7  to 
6.7  million  bats  in  eastern  North  America 
since  2006 

Given  the  recent  detection  of  WNS  in 
Washington,  establishing  baseline 
information  for  species  in  areas  of  the 
Pacific  Northwest  where  WNS  is  not  yet 
present  is  critical  for  conservation  and 
management  of  these  species.  Acoustic 
detectors  are  powerful  tools  for 
establishing  species  presence  and  habitat 
use.  Without  acoustic  monitoring  surveys  in 
this  region,  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of 
Engineers  (ACOE)  will  lack  information 
needed  to  mitigate  potential  impacts  to 
bats  from  WNS  and  make  informed 
management  decisions. 

To  address  these  information  needs,  we 
deployed  acoustic  detector/recorders  on 
ACOE  managed  lands  in  proximity  to  Albine 
Falls  Dam  located  on  the  Pend  Oreille  River. 
Our  goals  were  to  determine  which  species 
are  present  in  this  area,  provide  baseline 
data  that  can  be  used  for  WNS  surveillance, 
and  to  assess  the  impacts  of  this  disease 
and  other  natural  or  anthropogenic  threats 
to  bat  populations  in  this  area,  and  provide 
management  recommendations  for 


conservation  of  the  species  found  within 
ACOE  managed  lands. 

At  or  upstream  of  the  Albeni  Falls  Dam  on 
the  Pend  Oreille  River,  we  selected  13  sites 
on  lands  managed  by  the  U.S.  Army  Corps 
of  Engineers  to  conduct  this  project.  Three 
detector/recorder  units  were  rotated 
between  these  sites  throughout  the  active 
season  beginning  in  April  and  ending  in 
September.  Each  site  was  surveyed 
between  two  and  three  times  as  time  and 
logistic  considerations  allowed  (Table  1).  In 
total  26  surveys  were  conducted  across  all 
sites.  However,  due  to  technical  issues, 
detectors  did  not  collect  any  information 
during  three  of  these  surveys.  A  single 
detector  was  deployed  over  the  winter  of 
2016-2017  in  proximity  to  Albeni  Falls  Dam 

Between  September  2016  and  September 
2017,  a  total  of  21,811  bat  call  sequences 
were  recorded  with  a  9.9  percent  auto¬ 
identification  to  species  by  Sonobat  4.2.1 
software.  Overall  rates  of  auto¬ 
identification  were  lower  than  detectors 
placed  across  Montana,  Idaho,  and  North 
and  South  Dakota  which  average  of  23.7 
percent.  Across  all  sites,  average  nightly 
passes  by  bats  increased  through  July  and 
decreased  into  September.  Recorded 
activity  during  the  winter  was  low,  which  is 
similar  to  patterns  observed  at  sites  across 
Idaho,  Montana,  and  the  Dakotas. 

Of  the  21,811  recorded  call  sequences,  we 
hand  reviewed  2,320  with  the  goal  of 
determining  species  presence  by  site  and 
recording  period.  Between  April  and 
September,  10  species  were  identified 
within  the  study  area:  Hoary  Bat  [Lasiurus 
cinereus),  Big  Brown  Bat  (Eptiscus  Fuscus), 
Silver-haired  Bat  (Lasionycteris 


noctivagans),  Townsend's  Big-eared  Bat 
(Corynorhinus  townsendii),  California  Myotis 
(Myotis  californicus),  Western  Small-footed 
Myotis  (Myotis  ciliolabrum),  Long-eared 
Myotis  (Myotis  evotis),  Fringed  Myotis 
(Myotis  thysanodes),  Little  Brown  Myotis 
(Myotis  iucifugus),  Yuma  Myotis  (Myotis 
yumanensis).  Only  four  species  commonly 
found  in  Idaho  were  not  confirmed  within 
the  study  area:  Spotted  Bat  (Euderma 
macuiatum),  Pallid  Bat  (Antrozous  paiiidus), 
Long-legged  Myotis  (Myotis  voians),  and 
Canyon  Bat  (Parastreiius  Hesperus). 

Spotted,  Pallid,  and  Canyon  bats  are 
unlikely  to  be  present  because  they  require 
specialized  habitat  not  found  in  the  area. 
Conversely,  Long-legged  Myotis  may  occur 
within  the  area,  but  are  difficult  to  have 
definitive  confirmation  via  acoustic 
methods. 

Of  the  10  species  detected  at  sites  within 
the  project  area,  three  have  been  shown  to 
develop  WNS  when  exposed  to  Pd.  These 
species  are  the  Big  Brown  Bat,  Little  Brown 
Myotis,  and  Yuma  Myotis.  Additionally,  the 
Silver-haired  Bat  and  Townsend's  Big-eared 
Bat  have  been  shown  to  carry  Pd,  but  not 
exhibit  symptoms  of  WNS.  The  remaining 
Myotis  species:  California,  Long-eared, 
Western  Small-footed,  and  Fringed  have 
not  been  shown  to  carry  Pd  or  develop 
WNS.  Rather  than  indicating  immunity  to 
Pd,  the  lack  of  detections  of  individuals  with 
this  disease  is  likely  a  result  of  their  western 
distribution  that  has  not  overlap  with 
affected  areas.  As  many  other  Myotis 
species  are  impacted  by  WNS,  it  is  probably 
best  to  consider  these  species  as 
susceptible  until  proven  otherwise. 

Future  surveys  should  seek  to  determine  if 
the  species  found  during  this  work  are  still 


present  within  the  study  area.  Although  the 
short-term  deployments  make  the  activity 
data  difficult  to  use  as  a  baseline,  average 
bat  passes  per  night  may  be  an  adequate 
metric  for  future  monitoring  if  the  disease 
has  a  significant  negative  impact.  If  sites 
that  reduce  the  likelihood  of  vandalism  can 
be  found,  we  recommend  that  future 
acoustic  monitoring  include  long-term 
stations  capable  of  gathering  robust  activity 
data  across  both  the  active  and  hibernation 
seasons.  As  both  the  Townsend's  Big-eared 
Bat  and  Long-legged  Myotis  are  difficult  to 
detect  with  acoustic  methods,  targeted  mist 
net  surveys  of  creeks  and  ponds  off  of  the 
river  or  lake  and  flight  corridors  within 
forested  areas  should  be  considered  as  well 
as  age  and  sex  data  on  all  species.  Finally, 
projects  focusing  on  identifying  active 
season  roosts  within  both  natural  and 
artificial  structures,  hibernacula,  and 
monitoring  known  roosts  to  provide 
additional  baseline  data  to  inform 
management  decisions. 

Management  of  roost  features  used  by  bats 
within  ACOE  managed  lands  near  Albeni 
Falls  Dam  is  likely  to  have  the  biggest 
impact  on  local  populations.  Roosts  occur  in 
a  variety  of  natural  and  anthropogenic 
features  including  crevices  and  cracks  in 
rock  outcrops,  caves,  and  both  live  and 
dead  trees,  and  buildings,  bridges,  and 
mines.  Based  on  the  species  we  determined 
to  be  present  within  the  study  area, 
literature  documenting  roost  preferences, 
and  life  history  of  these  species,  we 
recommend  the  following  actions  for 
species  conservation  within  the  study  area: 


1.  Maintain  potential  roost  trees 
including  large  diameter  trees,  snags 
and  partially  dead  trees  that  provide 
cavities  or  loose  bark  for  animals  to 
roost  in  unless  they  pose  a  hazard  to 
people  in  the  immediate  area.  If 
removal  is  necessary,  wait  until  the 
late  fall  or  winter  to  remove  trees 
suspected  or  known  to  support 
roosting  bats. 

2.  Before  modification  of  any  buildings 
or  bridges,  conduct  surveys  to 
establish  whether  the  structures  are 
used  as  roosts.  These  surveys  could 
include  searching  for  guano  deposits 
and  urine  staining  on  the  interior  or 
exterior  of  structures,  and 
examining  crevices  and  sheltered 
areas  for  roosting  bats.  If  feasible 
conduct  exit  counts  at  dusk  at 


potential  exit  points  from  the 
structure.  If  bats  are  found  and 
exclusion  is  desired,  follow  best 
practices  for  exclusion  and  place 
alternative  roost  structures  (bat 
boxes)  in  the  local  area  to 
compensate  for  the  loss  of  roosting 
habitat. 

3.  Surveys  to  determine  bat  use  of 
other  potential  roosts  including  but 
not  limited  to  rock  outcrops,  caves, 
and  mines  should  be  conducted 
prior  to  any  modification. 

4.  Avoid  disturbance  of  known 
maternity  roosts  between  May  and 
July  and  known  hibernaculum 
between  October  and  April.

Background 

Persistence  of  populations  of  bats  may  be 
threatened  by  loss  of  roosting  sites, 
elimination  of  insect  prey,  collision  or 
drowning  hazards  at  sites  where  they 
forage,  drink,  and  mate,  and  a  lack  of 
baseline  information  on  distribution  and 
habitat  use  that  are  available  to  resource 
managers.  However,  in  recent  years, 
concerns  have  shifted  focus  to  White-Nose 
Syndrome  (WNS)  (Blehert  et  al.  2011)  and 
wind  turbine  development  (Kunz  et  al. 

2007,  Arnett  et  al.  2008).  Dramatic 
increases  in  mortality  posed  by  these 
threats  are  especially  significant  to  bat 
populations  because  bats  are  long-lived  and 
have  only  1  or  2  young  per  year  (Barclay 
and  Harder  2003). 

WNS  resulting  from  the  cold  adapted 
fungus  Pseudogymnoascus  destructans  has 
killed  an  estimated  5.7  to  6.7  million  bats  in 
eastern  North  America  since  2006  (Lorch  et 
al.  2011,  USFWS  News  Release  January  17, 
2012).  As  a  result,  the  extinction  of  Little 
Brown  Myotis  (Myotis  lucifugus)  is 
predicted  in  that  region  by  2026  (Frick  et  al. 
2010).  Additionally,  M.  lucifugus,  Northern 
Myotis  (M.  septentrionalis),  and  Tri-colored 
Bat  (Peri myotis  subfiavus)  have  all  been 
recommended  for  emergency  listing  under 
Schedule  1  of  Canada's  Species  at  Risk  Act 
(COSEWIC  February  3,  2012).  In  the  United 
States  M.  septentrionalis  has  been  listed  as 
threatened  under  the  United  States 
Endangered  Species  Act  (ESA)  (U.S.  Fish  and 
Wildlife  Service  2016),  and  M.  lucifugus  has 
been  petitioned  for  emergency  listing  under 
the  ESA  (Kunz  et  al.  2010).  Prior  to  2016, 
the  pathogen  was  only  documented  east  of 


the  Rockies  and  as  far  west  as  Nebraska. 
However,  in  March  of  2016  a  bat  showing 
symptoms  of  WNS  was  found  in 
Washington,  representing  the  first  time  the 
pathogen  has  been  documented  in  the 
Pacific  Northwest  (USFWS  News  Release 
March  31,  2016).  P.  destructans  has 
progressed  westward  to  at  least  Nebraska 
and  it  is  unknown  how  widespread  the 
fungus  is  in  Washington  State.  At  least 
three  bat  species  susceptible  to  WNS  are 
found  in  Northern  Idaho:  Big  Brown  Bat 
[Eptesicus  fuscus),  Yuma  Myotis  (M. 
yumanensis)  and  Little  Brown  Myotis  are 
(Blehert  et  al.  2011,  Washington 
Department  of  Fish  and  Wildlife  Press 
Release  May  2017). 

Given  the  recent  detection  of  WNS  in 
Washington,  establishing  baseline 
information  for  species  in  areas  of  the 
Pacific  Northwest  where  WNS  is  not  yet 
present  is  critical  for  conservation  and 
management  of  these  species.  Acoustic 
detectors  are  powerful  tools  for 
establishing  species  presence  and  habitat 
use  (Britzke  et  al.  2013).  Without  acoustic 
monitoring  surveys  in  this  region,  the  U.S. 
Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (ACOE)  will  lack 
information  needed  to  mitigate  potential 
impacts  to  bats  from  WNS  and  make 
informed  management  decisions. 

To  address  these  information  needs,  we 
deployed  acoustic  detector/recorders  on 
ACOE  managed  lands  in  proximity  to  Albine 
Falls  Dam  located  on  the  Pend  Oreille  River. 
Our  goals  were  to  determine  which  species 
are  present  in  this  area,  provide  baseline 
data  that  can  be  used  for  WNS  surveillance.

and  to  assess  the  impacts  of  this  disease 
and  other  natural  or  anthropogenic  threats 
to  bat  populations  in  this  area,  and  provide 


management  recommendations  for 
conservation  of  the  species  found  within 
ACOE  managed  lands. 


Study  Area 


At  or  upstream  of  the  Albeni  Falls  Dam  on 
the  Lake  Pend  Oreille,  we  selected  13  sites 
on  lands  managed  by  the  U.S.  Army  Corps 
of  Engineers  to  conduct  this  project.  The 
landscape  surrounding  the  river  is 
predominately  conifer  forest  with  sparse 
wetlands,  and  fields.  Areas  of  willows  (Salix 


spp.)  or  alder  (Alnus  spp.)  occur  at  the 
interface  between  the  river  and  uplands. 
Elevations  across  the  study  area  range  from 
620  and  630  m  above  sea  level.  Relatively 
mild  summer  temperatures  and  cool  wet 
winters  characterize  the  climate  of  the  local 
area  (Arguez  et  al.  2012).

Bat  Detector  Deployment 

Three  detector/recorder  units  were  rotated 
between  12  sites  throughout  the  active 
season  beginning  in  April  and  ending  in 
September.  Each  site  was  surveyed 
between  two  and  three  times  as  time  and 
logistic  considerations  allowed  (Table  1).  In 


total  26  surveys  were  conducted  across  all 
sites.  However,  due  to  technical  issues, 
detectors  did  not  collect  any  information 
during  three  of  these  surveys.  A  single 
detector  was  deployed  over  the  winter  of 
2016-2017  in  proximity  to  Albeni  Falls  Dam

Each  SM2Bat  or  SM2  Bat+  ultrasonic 
detector/recorder  (Wildlife  Acoustics, 
Maynard,  MA,  USA)  was  deployed, 
monitored,  and  maintained  with  the 
equipment,  supplies,  settings,  and  protocols 
listed  in  Montana's  Bat  and  White-Nose 
Syndrome  Surveillance  Plan  and  Protocols 
2012-  2016  (Maxell  2015).  Due  to  concerns 
of  vandalism,  we  chose  to  reduce  the  visual 
profile  of  our  detector/recorder  stations  by 
using  internal  D-cell  batteries  as  a  power 
source  rather  than  our  standard  long-term 
detector  power  supply  which  uses  a  12-volt 
car  battery  and  solar  panel.  Use  of  internal 
batteries  restricted  operating  time  for 
detectors  to  less  than  a  week  per 
deployment.  The  only  exception  was  the 
station  placed  at  the  dam  site,  which  was 
set  up  following  our  standard  long-term 
protocol  (Maxell  2015).  This  station  was 
secured  behind  a  high  fence,  reducing  the 
likelihood  that  it  would  be  vandalized  and 
therefore  was  suitable  for  long-term 
deployment. 

A  variety  of  factors  influence  the  detection 
and  recorded  quality  of  a  bat  echolocation 
call.  These  include  sensitivity  of  the 
individual  microphone,  temperature, 
humidity,  wind  speed,  and  frequency, 
amplitude,  distance,  and  directionality  of 
echolocation  calls  emitted  by  bats  (Parsons 


and  Szewczak  2009,  Agranat  2014).  The 
energy  of  sounds  spreading  in  all  directions 
diminishes  by  one  fourth  for  every  doubling 
of  distance  because  the  surface  area  of  a 
sphere  is  related  to  the  square  of  its  radius. 
Furthermore,  higher  frequency  sounds  are 
diminished  over  shorter  distances  because 
of  atmospheric  absorption  (Parsons  and 
Szewczak  2009,  Agranat  2014).  Testing  of 
the  SMX-US  microphone  used  in  this  study 
indicates  that  bats  emitting  frequencies  in 
the  range  of  20  kHz  should  be  detected  at 
distances  of  24  to  33  meters  from  the 
microphone  while  those  emitting 
frequencies  in  the  range  of  40  kHz  should 
be  detected  at  distances  of  18  to  22  meters 
(Agranat  2014).  These  distances  are  the 
radii  of  the  relevant  spheres  of  detection 
around  microphones  when  they  are  at  full 
sensitivity.  However,  we  know  that 
sensitivity  varied  over  time  by  an  unknown 
magnitude  as  a  result  of  precipitation  and 
freezing  events,  some  of  which 
permanently  reduced  the  sensitivity  of 
microphones.

Data  Management  and  Call  Analyses 

Acoustic  file  recordings,  in  both  original 
WAC  and  processed  WAV  formats,  are 
stored  in  the  Montana  Bat  Call  Library. 
These  are  housed  on  a  series  of  15-20 
Terabyte  Drobo  5D  and  5N  storage  arrays  at 
the  Montana  State  Library  as  well  as  a 
secondary  offsite  location  to  protect  against 
catastrophic  loss.  Acoustic  analysis  results 
and  temperature  files  were  all  processed 
and  combined  within  SQL  database  tables  in 
accordance  with  the  general  work  flow 
pattern  for  data  management  and  analysis 
outlined  in  the  text  and  in  Appendices  8-10 
of  Maxell  (2015).  Bat  call  sequences  were 
analyzed  with  the  goal  of  definitively 
identifying  individual  species  presence  by 
site  and  survey  period  in  accordance  with 
the  Echolocation  Call  Characteristics  of 
Montana  Bats  and  Montana  Bat  Call 
Identification  materials  in  Appendices  6  and 
7  of  Montana's  Bat  and  White-Nose 
Syndrome  Surveillance  Plan  and  Protocols 
2012-  2016  (Maxell  2015).

Results 


Total  Volume  of  Bat  Passes  and  Auto- 
Identification  Rates 

Between  September  2016  and  September 
2017,  a  total  of  21,811  bat  call  sequences 
were  recorded  with  a  9.9  percent  auto¬ 
identification  to  species  by  Sonobat  4.2.1 
software.  Overall  rates  of  auto¬ 
identification  were  lower  than  at  other 
detectors  placed  across  Montana,  Idaho, 
and  North  and  South  Dakota  which  average 
of  23.7  percent  (Montana  Natural  Heritage 
Program  Acoustic  Survey  Data  2017).  This 
discrepancy  could  be  due  to  placement  of 
detectors  in  proximity  to  forest  edges, 
which  were  unavoidable  within  the  study 
area,  or  some  other  unknown  factor. 

General  Patterns  of  Bat  Activity 

Although  our  short-term  deployments  are 
not  suitable  for  use  in  a  robust  assessment 
and  comparison  of  activity  levels,  we  can 
make  general  comparisons  across  and 
between  sites.  However,  as  detectors  only 
record  for  short  periods  (days),  recorded 
activity  could  be  influenced  by 
environmental  variables  that  affect  bat 
activity  such  as  precipitation,  wind,  and 
moon  phase,  and  confound  assessment  of 
bat  activity  at  the  site.  Across  all  sites, 
average  nightly  passes  by  bats  increased 
through  July  and  decreased  into  September 
(Figure  2).  Recorded  activity  during  the 
winter  was  low,  which  is  similar  to  patterns 
observed  at  sites  across  Idaho,  Montana, 
and  the  Dakotas  (Figure  3). 


Figure  2  The  average  number  of  calls  recorded  across  the 
study  area  by  month.  The  number  of  recording  nights 
within  each  month  is  shown  adjacent  to  each  point. 

The  relative  number  of  bat  passes  recorded 
during  the  late  summer  and  early  fall  across 
the  study  area  differed  from  the  regional 
network  trend.  The  Albeni  Falls  area  had 
significantly  lower  amount  of  calls  recorded 
in  August  relative  to  June  and  July.  This  is 
atypical  to  other  sites  across  the  region. 

This  trend  may  be  related  to  spatial  bias 
introduced  through  the  use  of  short-term 
deployments  and  uneven  sampling  of  sites 
over  time.  If  these  data  show  an  actual 
biological  trend,  it  may  indicate  local 
migration  or  change  in  habitat  use  by  bats 
exploiting  resources  elsewhere  in  the 
surrounding  area.  In  the  Northern  Rocky 
Mountains,  young  of  all  species  are  initially 
captured  in  late  July,  as  juveniles  become 
flighted  (Bachen  et  al.  2016).  Reduced 
activity  coinciding  with  volant  young  may 
indicate  that  females  and  pups  leaving  their 
maternity  colonies  and  migrating  away 
from  the  river  or  lake  for  some  unknown 


6 


reason.  To  assess  the  validity  of  this  trend, 
long-term  acoustic  and  mist  net  surveys  are 
required. 

Given  the  study  design  considerations,  sites 
in  the  central  region  of  the  study  area 
appear  to  have  consistently  higher  average 


nightly  activity  of  all  species  (Figure  5).  As 
all  sites  were  not  sampled  at  the  same  time, 
these  results  should  be  viewed  with 
caution.  However,  all  high  activity  sites 
were  clustered  in  the  center  of  the  study 
area,  which  supports  a  biological  base  for 
this  trend.

data  provides  insight  into  variation  in  activity  levels  across  the  year.

Species  Detections  and  Distributions 

Of  the  21,811  recorded  call  sequences,  we 
hand  reviewed  2,320  with  the  goal  of 
determining  species  presence  by  site  and 
survey  period.  Between  April  and 
September,  10  species  were  identified 
within  the  study  area.  Only  four  species 
commonly  found  in  Idaho  were  not 
confirmed  within  the  study  area:  Spotted 
Bat  (Euderma  maculatum),  Pallid  Bat 
(Antrozous  pallidus),  Long-legged  Myotis 
(Myotis  volans),  and  Canyon  Bat 
(Parastrellus  Hesperus).  Spotted,  Pallid,  and 
Canyon  bats  are  unlikely  to  be  present 
because  they  require  specialized  habitat  not 
found  in  the  area.  Conversely,  Long-legged 
Myotis  may  occur  within  the  area,  but  are 
difficult  to  have  definitive  confirmation  via 
acoustic  methods  (Maxell  2015). 

Although  we  list  the  presence  of  each 
species  within  the  area  by  site,  given  the 
limited  ability  of  short-term  detector 
deployments,  lackof  detection  should  not 
be  interpreted  as  species  absence.  Some 
species  are  more  easily  identified  or 
produce  distinctive  call  sequences  more 
frequently  than  others  (e.g.  Hoary  Bat 
[Lasiurus  cinereus)  versus  Long-legged 
Myotis,  Maxell  2015).  Therefore,  the 
number  of  sites  where  detection  of  a 
species  occurred  may  be  resultant  of 
sampling  and  survey  methods  rather  than 
true  presence.  Given  the  similarity  and 
geographic  connectivity  of  sites  along  the 
river/reservoir,  it  is  plausible  that  any 
species  detected  at  one  site  may  also  be 
found  at  others.  Consequently,  the  best 
interpretation  of  these  data  are  that  all 
confirmed  species  are  present  within  the 
study  area. 


Hoary  Bats  were  hand-confirmed  at  five 
sites:  Hoodoo  Creek,  Morton  River 
Recreation  Area,  Morton  River  Slough, 
Priest  River  Wildlife  Management  Area 
(WMA)  and  Springy  Point.  The  first 
detection  occurred  in  June  and  the  species 
was  confirmed  as  present  through 
September.  These  detection  dates  are 
consistent  with  data  collected  at  long-term 
stations  in  western  Montana.  Hoary  bats 
are  known  to  migrate  to  climates  that  are 
more  favorable  in  the  winter  (Shump  and 
Shump  1982).  Based  on  these  data,  similar 
behavior  occurs  within  the  study  area.  This 
species  primarily  roosts  on  the  branches 
and  foliage  of  trees,  (Shump  and  Shump 
1982),  and  roosting  habitat  is  found  across 
the  study  area. 

Big  Brown  Bats  were  confirmed  at  a  single 
site,  the  Priest  River  Recreation  Area.  This 
species  is  likely  more  common  across  the 
area  than  this  single  detection  would 
suggest.  The  calls  of  Big  Brown  Bats  are 
often  similar  to  Silver-haired  Bats,  which 
makes  definitive  confirmation  of  species 
presence  using  acoustic  methods  difficult. 
Call  sequences  automatically  identified  by 
Sonobat  Software  as  Big  Brown  Bats  were 
present  at  two  additional  sites,  Albeni  Cove 
and  Hoodoo  Creek,  and  may  be  present  at 
these  additional  locations.  Given  the 
species  propensity  for  roosting  in  buildings 
as  well  as  bridges  and  natural  features 
(reviewed  in  Maxell  2015  Appendix  5), 
suitable  habitat  exists  across  much  of  the 
study  area,  but  targeted  mist  net  or  roost 
surveys  may  be  needed  to  document  this 
species  at  additional  sites  within  the  area. 

The  presence  of  Silver-haired  Bats  was 
confirmed  at  five  sites:  Morton  Slough, 


9 


Priest  River  Recreation  Area,  Priest  River 
WMA,  Riley  Creek,  and  Springy  Point.  This 
species  was  first  detected  in  May  and  was 
present  each  month  through  September.  In 
northern  areas  overwintering  strategies  are 
poorly  understood  for  this  species,  but  it  is 
possible  that  it  may  remain  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  study  area  year  round.  In  Montana 
echolocation  calls  have  been  recorded 
throughout  the  winter  during  periods  of 
relatively  warm  temperatures  (Montana 
Natural  Heritage  Program  Acoustic  Data 
2017),  suggesting  the  species  remains  in  the 
region  through  the  winter.  Data  to  assess 
whether  the  species  pursues  a  similar 
strategy  in  this  area  of  Idaho  are  lacking. 
Deployment  of  long-term  acoustic 
monitoring  stations  could  help  determine  if 
Silver-haired  Bats  remain  in  the  area  year 
round. 

A  single  call  sequence  from  a  Townsend's 
Big-eared  Bat  (Corynorhinus  townsendii) 
was  recorded  at  the  Morton  River  Access 
Site  in  July  of  2017.  Due  to  its  low  call 
intensity  and  habit  of  foraging  in  or  near 
vegetation,  detectors  infrequently  record 
this  species,  even  in  areas  where  it  is 
present  (Maxell  2015).  Townsend's  Big- 
eared  Bats  have  been  previously 
documented  infrequently  in  similar  habitat 
in  adjacent  areas  of  Montana  (MTNHP  Point 
Observation  Database),  but  without  target 
roost  surveys,  it  is  difficult  to  determine 
how  widespread  or  abundant  the  species  is 
within  the  area.  The  species  may  use  caves, 
rock  crevices,  and  mines  as  both  active 
season  and  winter  roosts,  and  buildings 
during  the  active  season  as  well  (reviewed 
in  Maxell  2015  Appendix  5). 


The  presence  of  California  Myotis  (Myotis 
californicus)  was  confirmed  at  six  sites: 
Morton  River  Recreation  Area,  Morton 
River  Slough,  Pack  River  Delta,  Priest  River 
Recreation  Area,  Priest  River  WMA,  and 
Springy  Point.  The  species  was  present 
across  the  active  season,  beginning  in  May 
and  last  recorded  in  September.  Cracks  and 
crevices  in  rock  outcrops  as  well  as  caves 
and  mines  are  thought  to  be  used  as 
hibernacula  within  this  region  (as  reviewed 
in  Maxell  2015).  If  suitable  hibernacula  are 
present  within  the  study  area,  California 
Myotis  may  remain  in  the  area  year-round. 
To  confirm  year-round  presence, 
deployment  of  long-term  acoustic  detector 
stations  or  roost  surveys  are  necessary. 

Western  Small-footed  Myotis  (Myotis 
ciliolabrum)  was  only  confirmed  at  the 
Albeni  Cove  site  in  August.  This  species  is 
commonly  found  roosting  in  rock  crevices, 
in  tree  cracks,  or  buildings  (Hoffman  et  al. 
1969,  Hendrix  et  al.  2000).  As  rock  outcrops 
are  less  common  within  the  study  area,  the 
species  may  have  limited  presence  due  to  a 
lack  of  suitable  roosting  habitat. 

Long-eared  Myotis  (Myotis  evotis)  were 
confirmed  at  four  sites:  Morton  River 
Recreation  Area,  Morton  Slough,  Riley 
Creek,  and  Springy  Point.  The  species  was 
first  detected  in  May  and  every  subsequent 
month  through  August.  Long-eared  Myotis 
use  of  a  variety  of  roost  structures 
throughout  the  active  season  including  live 
trees,  snags  and  stumps,  buildings,  and 
bridges.  It  has  been  found  in  caves  and 
mines,  but  may  also  use  rock  outcrops 
(Manning  and  Jones  1989,  reviewed  in 
Maxell  2015  Appendix  5).  If  suitable 
hibernacula  are  found  within  or  in  proximity 


10 


to  the  study  area,  the  species  may  be 
present  throughout  the  year.  To  confirm 
year-round  presence,  deployment  of  long¬ 
term  acoustic  detector  stations  or  roost 
surveys  are  required. 

Fringed  Myotis  (Myotis  thysanodes)  were 
confirmed  at  both  the  Albeni  Cover  and 
Morton  Slough  sites.  Both  detections 
occurred  in  August  of  2017.  The  species  is 
infrequently  detected  with  acoustic 
detectors  or  using  mist  nets  (supported  by 
the  MTNHP  Point  Observation  Database), 
consequently  the  few  detections  within  the 
study  area  are  not  surprising.  To-date  little 
is  known  about  overwintering  habits  of  this 
species  in  the  inland  northwest.  In  similar 
habitat  near  Flathead  Lake  in  northwest 
Montana,  a  single  individual  was  found 
hibernating  in  a  cave  (D.  Bachen,  personal 
observation).  Within  the  project  area  it  is 
unknown  whether  the  species  remains  in 
the  region  year-round  or  that  some 
individuals  remain  and  others  migrate  to 
more  favorable  locations  to  overwinter. 

Little  Brown  Myotis  was  definitively 
identified  at  all  sites,  and  between 
September  2016  and  September  2017. 
These  data  indicate  the  species  is 
widespread  during  the  active  season  and 
hibernates  in  or  within  proximity  to  the 
study  area. 

Yuma  Myotis  was  confirmed  present  at 
seven  sites  during  the  active  season:  Albeni 


Cove,  Hoodoo  Creek,  Morton  River  Access 
Site,  Morton  River  Slough,  Priest  River 
WMA,  Riley  Creek,  and  Springy  Point.  Active 
season  detections  occurred  in  May  through 
September.  At  the  Albeni  Dam  site  the 
species  was  detected  during  the 
hibernation  season.  Yuma  Myotis  use  a 
diversity  of  roost  features  in  the  active 
season  including  trees,  snags,  rock 
outcrops,  buildings,  and  bridges. 
Overwintering  sites  are  not  well  described, 
but  hibernation  in  rock  outcrops  may  occur 
(reviewed  in  Maxell  2015  Appendix  5). 

Long-legged  Myotis  (Myotis  volans)  was 
automatically  identified  by  Sonobat  to  be 
present  at  six  sites.  This  species  is  incredibly 
difficult  to  identify  using  acoustic  methods, 
as  almost  all  calls  are  indistinguishable  from 
other  40  kHz  Myotis  species  (Maxell  2015a). 
After  hand  review,  no  call  sequence  could 
be  attributed  to  Long-legged  Myotis.  Given 
that  the  habitat  is  similar  to  locations  where 
we  have  captured  this  species  during  mist 
net  surveys  in  western  Montana  (supported 
by  the  MTNHP  Point  Observation 
Database),  we  believe  it  is  possible  the 
species  is  present.  To  confirm  that  it  is 
present  targeted  mist  netting  should  be 
conducted  during  the  active  season  as  the 
species  is  easily  captured  and  identified  in¬ 
hand.

sampling,  months  without  detections  may  reflect  a  lack  of  survey  effort  rather  than  true  absence.

Species  Activity  Trends 

Using  the  call  attributes  returned  by 
Sonobat  as  indices  of  activity  across  all 
sites,  the  most  active  species  were  in  the 
genus  Myotis.  Due  to  the  relatively  low 
auto-identification  rates  and  hand 
confirmation  of  species  for  these  sites  we 
have  chosen  to  report  these  activity  indices 
by  call  class  rather  than  species.  Within  the 


active  season  40-50  kHz  bats,  including  all 
Myotis  species  had  the  highest  total 
number  of  bat  passes  across  the  study  area 
(13,479).  Larger  bats  such  as  Hoary,  Big 
Brown,  Silver-haired,  and  Townsend's  Big- 
eared  Bats  echolocate  in  the  20-30  kHz 
range,  and  across  the  study  area  only  826 
calls  were  recorded  within  this  group. 


12 


The  long-term  station  placed  at  Albine  Falls 
Dam  over  the  winter  of  2016-2017  recorded 
relatively  few  call  sequences  (153),  and  all 
were  in  the  40-50  kHz  range.  Only  two 
species  were  identified  at  this  location. 

Little  Brown  Bat  and  Yuma  Myotis. 
Unfortunately,  much  ambient  ultrasonic 


noise  was  present  at  the  site,  presumably 
from  the  nearby  dam  and  associated 
infrastructure.  This  triggered  the 
detector/recorder  and  resulted  in  the 
internal  memory  cards  being  filled  by  late 
December  restricting  the  recording  period 
to  approximately  two  months. 


Conservation  and  Management 


Conservation  Status  of  Detected  Species 

The  Silver-haired  Bat,  Hoary  Bat, 
Townsend's  Big-eared  Bat,  and  Little  Brown 
Myotis  are  listed  as  Idaho  Species  of 
Greatest  Conservation  Need  (SGCN)  under 
the  Idaho  Comprehensive  Wildlife 
Conservation  Strategy  (Idaho  Department 
of  Fish  and  Game  2005).  The  remaining 
species  detected  within  the  project  area  are 
not  included  on  this  list,  but  have  a  state 
rank  of  S3.  This  designation  indicates  that 
these  species  are  potentially  at  risk  of 
extirpation  due  to  declining  numbers  or 
threats  to  persistence.  Townsend's  Big- 
eared  Bat  and  Fringed  Myotis  are  listed  as 
sensitive  by  the  US  Forest  Service  within 
Region  1.  No  species  found  within  the  study 
area  is  currently  listed  as  federally 
threatened  or  endangered. 

Implications  for  White-Nosed  Syndrome 
Monitoring 

To-date,  the  presence  of 
Pseudogymnoascus  destructans  (Pd)  and 
associated  White-Nose  Syndrome  (WNS) 
have  not  been  detected  in  Idaho  (White- 
nose  syndrome  occurrence  map  -  by  year 
2017).  However,  detections  of  Pd  and  WNS 
within  approximately  400  km  of  the  project 
site  in  King  County,  Washington  (Lorch  et  al. 
2016)  have  increased  the  urgency  for 
establishing  baseline  metrics  to  assess 


future  impacts  on  resident  bats.  Of  the  10 
species  detected  at  sites  within  the  project 
area,  three  have  been  shown  to  develop 
WNS  when  exposed  to  Pd.  These  species 
are  the  Big  Brown  Bat,  Little  Brown  Myotis, 
and  Yuma  Myotis.  Additionally,  the  Silver- 
haired  Bat  and  Townsend's  Big-eared  Bat 
have  been  shown  to  carry  Pd,  but  not 
exhibit  symptoms  of  WNS 
(https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/abo 
ut/bats-affected-wns).  The  remaining 
Myotis  species:  California,  Long-eared, 
Western  Small-footed,  and  Fringed  have 
not  been  shown  to  carry  Pd  or  develop 
WNS.  Rather  than  indicating  immunity  to 
Pd,  the  lack  of  detections  of  individuals  with 
this  disease  is  likely  a  result  of  their  western 
distribution  that  has  not  overlap  with 
affected  areas.  As  many  other  Myotis 
species  are  impacted  by  WNS,  it  is  probably 
best  to  consider  these  species  as 
susceptible  until  proven  otherwise. 

Our  presence  data  and  average  activity 
levels  may  serve  as  a  baseline  for  future 
monitoring  efforts  to  document  the  impacts 
of  Pd  when  it  eventually  reaches  western 
Idaho.  Establishment  of  baselines  before 
the  disease  invades  this  area  are  important 
to  allow  assessment  of  the  impacts  on  bats 
within  this  region.  Without  pre-WNS 
baselines,  assessment  of  the  impacts  of  the 


13 


disease  on  the  abundance  and  distribution 
of  susceptible  species  is  not  possible. 

Future  surveys  should  seek  to  determine  if 
the  species  found  during  this  work  are  still 
present  within  the  study  area.  Although  the 
short-term  deployments  make  the  activity 
data  difficult  to  use  as  a  baseline  due  to  low 
numbers  of  nights  surveyed,  average  bat 
passes  per  night  may  be  an  adequate  metric 
for  future  monitoring  if  the  disease  has  a 
significant  negative  impact.  If  sites  that 
reduce  the  likelihood  of  vandalism  can  be 
found,  we  recommend  that  future  acoustic 
monitoring  include  long-term  stations 
capable  of  gathering  robust  activity  data 
across  both  the  active  and  hibernation 
seasons.  As  both  the  California  Big-eared 
Bat  and  Long-legged  Myotis  are  difficult  to 
detect  with  acoustic  methods,  targeted  mist 
net  surveys  of  creeks  and  ponds  off  of  the 
river  or  lake  and  flight  corridors  within 
forested  areas  should  be  considered  as  well 
as  age  and  sex  data  on  all  species.  Finally, 
projects  focusing  on  identifying  active 
season  roosts  within  both  natural  and 
artificial  structures,  hibernacula,  and 
monitoring  known  roosts  to  provide 
additional  baseline  data  to  inform 
management  decisions. 

Conservation  of  Roosts  and  Other 
Landscape  Features  Important  for  Bats 

Conservation  and  management  of  roost 
features  used  by  bats  within  ACOE  managed 
lands  near  Albeni  Falls  Dam  is  likely  to  have 
the  biggest  impact  on  local  populations. 
Roosts  occur  in  a  variety  of  natural  and 
anthropogenic  features  including  crevices 
and  cracks  in  rock  outcrops,  caves,  and  both 
live  and  dead  trees,  and  buildings,  bridges, 
and  mines.  Based  on  the  species  we 


determined  to  be  present  within  the  study 
area,  literature  documenting  roost 
preferences  (see  Maxell  2015  for  a 
comprehensive  review  of  known  roost 
types  by  species),  and  life  history  of  these 
species,  we  recommend  the  following 
actions  for  species  conservation  within  the 
study  area: 

1.  Maintain  potential  roost  trees 
including  large  diameter  trees,  snags 
and  partially  dead  trees  that  provide 
cavities  or  loose  bark  for  animals  to 
roost  in  unless  they  pose  a  hazard  to 
people  in  the  immediate  area.  If 
removal  is  necessary,  wait  until  the 
late  fall  or  winter  to  remove  trees 
suspected  or  known  to  support 
roosting  bats. 

2.  Before  modification  of  any  buildings 
or  bridges,  conduct  surveys  to 
establish  whether  the  structures  are 
used  as  roosts.  These  surveys  could 
include  searching  for  guano  deposits 
and  urine  staining  on  the  interior  or 
exterior  of  structures,  and 
examining  crevices  and  sheltered 
areas  for  roosting  bats.  If  feasible 
conduct  exit  counts  at  dusk  at 
potential  exit  points  from  the 
structure.  If  bats  are  found  and 
exclusion  is  desired,  follow  best 
practices  for  exclusion  (e.g. 
http://www.batcon.0rg/resources/f 

or-specific-issues/bats-in- 
buildings/excluding-a-colony)  and 
place  alternative  roost  structures 
(bat  boxes)  in  the  local  area  to 
compensate  for  the  loss  of  roosting 
habitat. 


14 


3.  Surveys  to  determine  bat  use  of 
other  potential  roosts  including  but 
not  limited  to  rock  outcrops,  caves, 
and  mines  should  be  conducted 
prior  to  any  modification. 

4.  Avoid  disturbance  of  known 
maternity  roosts  between  May  and 
July  and  known  hibernaculum 
between  October  and  April.
