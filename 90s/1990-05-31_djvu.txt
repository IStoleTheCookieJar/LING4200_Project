Citations Issued 
For Taking Fawns 


DNR conservation officers have begun issuing: cita- 
lions to persons who remove fawns and other young 
animals from the woods without permission. 

Conservation officer Mark Lutz. said every spring 
young animals are taken from the woods by people who 
think the animals have been abandoned by their mothers, 
More than 80 percent of these animals dic. 

“Mom isnotthat faraway,” said Lutz, “She is probably 
just out of sight or hunting for food.” 

Persons removing a young animal from the woods face 
fines of about $115 for being in possession of a gatne 
animal protected by the DNR without a permit, Anyone 
finding a young animal and thinks there might be a 
problem should contacta conservation officer, the near-

Forest Fire Property Damage 
Estimates Reach $5.5 Million 


By Jrene Pettyjohn 

Property damage cstimates have reached the $5.5 million 
mark as insurance companics continuc to process claims from 
victims of the devastating forest fire that ripped through 
Crawford County on Tuesday, May 8. 

George Stancil, vice president of the Comelt Agency, said 
preliminary estimates of losses insured by his agency alone 
have reached $2 million and will go higher. He said two other 
Grayling independent insurance agencies, Sorenson and Gray- 
ling Insurance, have processed 26 more loss claims that total 
about $650,000, 

State Farm Insurance has approved in excess of $600,000 in 
claims. Disaster supervisor for the agency, Bill Heemer, who 
has becn working from a temporary office at the Grayling 
Holiday Inn, said they are still getting a trickle of claims, 
primarily for tree damage, 

Herb Olson, agent for the Grayling Farm Bureau Insurance 
office, said his company has approved nearly $200,000 in 
claims that varied from one total loss of a residence, destroyed 
recreational vehicles to smoke damage. 

Total insured losses are estimated at $5.5 million, but Stancil 
said a complete loss figure, insured and uninsured, is difficult 
lo praject because of the fluctuation of tand values. 

“Itis not uncommon for us to process one million dollars in 
small claims during a year,” said Stancil, “but $2 million in one 
day puts a different color on things,” 

Stancit said, at last count, Cornell had processed claims for 
31 total residential tosses, 

RELIEF EFFORTS CONTINUE 

As lire victims file for insurance claims, community relief 
clforts continue to try to help with its citizen's losses. 

Last Friday, Crawford County emergency management 
director Howard Taylor announced that the federal govern- 
ment had declared the county a disaster arca, making fire 
victims cligible for a variety of services. He said a One Stop 
Assistance Center will be established at the Knights of Colum- 
bus Hallan Norway Street beginning Wednesday, May 30, and 
concluding at4 p.m. on Friday, June t, (See details in separate 
article in this week's issue.) 

In addition lo ‘Faylor, representatives of the Ministerial 
Association willbe present toaccept applications from victims 
of the fire, 

Rev. Robert Gordon, president of the Ministerial Assoc., 


said his organization is asking everyone who has a need as a 
result of the fire, regardless of the size, to make application 
with therm so that they can assess the community's needs and 
begin processing the applications, according to need, Gordon 
said the Ministerial Assoc. is hoping to have all applications by 
July Ist. 

“The Salvation Army, American Red Cross and Michigan 
Dept. of Social Services are limited to type and quantily of 
services they can give,” said Rev. Gordon, “We are not.” 

He said the Ministerial Assoc. will be focusing their assis- 
tance on needs not covered by the other agencies, 

The organization of local clergy has received more than 
$47,000 in donations for fire victims, These donations range 
from $110.85 given by the Grayling Middle School fifth grade 
students, carned by collecting pop bottles, to a $10,000 dona- 
tion from Shell Western, 

“The goal of this organization is to use these funds to help the 
fire victims,” said Father Derik Roy, treasurer for the group, 
“not to have $30,000 sitting in the bank this time next year.” 

“The folks who had the least and lost the mostare the people 
we need to help the first,” said Rev. Gordon, “But every 
application will be considered, and we will be extending 
financial support as long as the moncy holds out.” 

Clothing outlets are beginning toclose their operations as the 
need for clothing is diminishing. 

Rev. Gordon said a truck from St. Vincent DePaul, of 
Detroit, came to St. John Lutheran Church last Friday and took 
the clothing items not needed by fire victims, Inmates from the 
Crawford County Jail helped load the bags of clothing on the 
truck. 

St. John Lutheran Church's fellowship hall and sanctuary 
have been so full of clothing since the fire that Sunday worship 
services were held outside on May 13, and at St. Mary’s 
Catholic Church on May 20. 

Clothing and food items will be available at the St. Mary's 
Catholic Church Family Center for one more week, and then 
clothing needs will be handled through the St. Francis Thrift 
Shop. Father Roy said there will be no charge for fire victims. 
Clothing will be available through the Thrift Shop for three or 
four months, or until all the needs of the community have been 
met. 

Because of the tremendous volume of clothing donations, St 
Mary’s is opening its clothing to everyone in the community

Voters To Decide New Elementary Request 


Voters in the Crawford-AuSable School District will be 
asked to approve two issues for the construction and operation 
of a new clementary school on June 11. 

One mill is being requested to pay off the bonds for the $5.5 
million construction project. Another 1.75 mills is being 
requested to pay for the cost of operating the new school and 
will not be collected until the building is opened. 

The board of education has stated that both issues must pass 
before the new school will be built. 

WHY BUILD? 

student cnrotiment atthe Grayling Elementary School is at 
625 students, making ttone of the largest elementary schools 
in Michigan, Overcrowding conditions made it necessary last 
fall to bus five classes (118 students) from the Grayling 
Elementary School to Frederic Elementary School. 

The problem of too many students for too few classrooms 
will increase as large kindergarten classes (165-185) move 
through the clementary schools to the Grayling Middle School, 
which was designed for 600 students, 

By 1992, the Grayling Middle Schoo! will have an enroll- 
ment of 700 students, 100 students over capacity. Before this 
date, space for the fitth grade must be made available at the 
elementary school level. 

hvery classroom in both clementary schools is in use now, 

COST TO THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER 

The new elementary school will cost persons with a $50,000 
home with an assessed valuc of $25,000, $25 for the 1990-91 
tax year (during construction) and an additional $43.75 a year 
after the school opens for a total tax increase of $68.75 a year 
for about 20 years, 

WHAT DOES THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT 
INCLUDE? 

The new elementary school will be constructed for grades 
pre-school through second grades. It will be focated on the 
current Grayling Elementary School playground and high 
school football field site. 

Although the new elementary school will be a separate 
school with its own principal, gymnasiuo and cafeteria, it will 
be connected to the Grayling Elementary School by a 40 fi, 
hallway and share a central kilchen. Construction will include 
an appropriate playground, parking spaces, and a bus traffic 
lane for both buildings. 

In addition to the construction of the new building, the 
project will include some structural modifications to the Gray- 
ling and Frederic Elementary Schools. 

Atthe Grayling Elementary School, which will house grades, 
3-5, construction will include expanding the office space, im- 
Proving ventilation, making energy efficicney improvements, 
and constructing an appropriate playground: and parking 
Facility, 

At Frederic, renovations will include constructing walls to 


enclose open classrooms, roof replacement on the 30 year old 
section, cnergy efficiency improvements and playground and 
parking improvements, 

Because the new elementary school is to be built on the site 
of the football field, it will be necessary to relocate the football 
field and track just north of the Grayling High Schoot parking 
lot on property owned by the school district. 

WHY BUILD THE NEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 

IN TOWN? 

Building the new clementary school next to the Grayling 
Elementary School will allow the two building to not only 
share acentral kitchen, bul also support personne! and spectal- 
ists. Having the two schools centrally located will save

WHAT IF THE BOND ISSUE FAILS? 

Without the new elementary school, the Grayling Middle 
School and both elementary schools will be seriously over- 
crowded, The two substandard portable classrooms at the 
Grayling Elementary School will be pressed into use and the 
busing of Grayling Elementary School students to the Frederic 
Elementary School will continue. 

If the bond issue is approved on June [1th, the new elemen 
tary school will be ready for the fall of 1991.

Citizen-Soldiers Maintain High 
Quality of 1071st Company 


By Jason Teddy, 
Cadet MI ARNG 

Maintenance is a term 

common to all those who 
operate machinery, but to the 
soldiers of the 1071st Heavy 
Equipment Maintenance 
Company, this term possesses 
a much deeper meaning. The 
1071 st, located at the Mobili- 
zation and Training Equip- 
ment Site (MATES), turns 
wrenches on everything from 
Jeeps to tanks, and with great 
efficiency. In fact, because of 
the unit’s maintenance mis- 
sion and technical expertise, 
the 1071st is a high priority 
unit upon mobilization in time 
of conflict. This priority al- 
lows for the unit to be dis- 
patched to Europe in as little 
as three days, should the need 
arise. This responsibility is 
borne well by the unit, how- 
ever, according to Captain Ken 
Arndt, Commander of the 
107\st. 

Captain Arndt, part owner 
of the Alpine Appraisal Serv- 
ices, Inc, in Gaylord, served 
for seven years on active duty 
in the United State Army be- 
fore enlisting in the Michigan 
National Guard in 1987. It 
was not until December 1989 
that he assumed the position 


of Commanding Officer of the 
1071st, which he seems to 
enjoy greatly, 

“T think that the best part 
about the Army is working 
with people,” says Arndt re- 
garding the National Guard 
and his role as Commander, 
“and of the people I’ve seen in 
Northern Michigan in the 
National Guard, the people of 
the 107 1st are the very best.” 
This opinion is seconded by 
Second Lieutenant Chris 
Golnick and Company First 
Sergeant Rudy Martinez as 
they speak about the fire that 
the immediate area. Soon, 
however, it is her hope that 
she and her family will be able 
to find a home in the Grayling 
area. 

Besides being a husband 
and father, Rudy Martinez, 
another prominent figure in 
the 1071st, performs as the 
Company First Sergeant for 
the 107ist. Martinez, who 
has lived in the Grayling area 
since 1974, has had much 
experience with the Guard and 
the community, which he 
views aS 4 positive, comple- 
mentary relationship, both 
socially and economically. 
Martinez also stressed the 
selfless service of the soldiers

of the 1071st regarding the 
recent fire and the dedication 
they exhibited to the unit and 
to the community, For this he 
is both grateful and proud, 
especially when performing 
his duties as First Sergeant. 

Clearly, the men and women 
of the 1071st HEMCO are 
unique in their technical and 
professional mission regard- 
ing their role in the defense of 
our nation. Even more im- 
pressive, however, is their 
dedication to the growth, pres- 
ervation, and welfare of the 
community, not only as sol- 
diers, but as citizens as well. 
recently raged east of Gray- 
ling. According to Golnick, 
approximately fifty to sixty 
people from the unit volun- 
teered their assistance to the 
effort. 


Golnick, married and father 
of three, serves as Mainte- 
nance Control Officer of the 
1071\st. As Maintenance 
Control Officer, Lieutenant 
Golnick is responsible for 
overseeing and coordinating 
workloads between the unit 
and MATES, which is cur- 
rently a full-time duty. Fortu- 
nately, these duties do not 
impose significantly upon his 
home fife. In fact, Mrs. 


Golnick is actively involved 
in the Family Support Group 
for the unit, which is an or- 
ganization that acts as a liai- 
son between the unit and the 
soldier's family during mobi- 
lization and peacctime, 

Another officer, Second 
Licutenant Luanne Cunning- 
ham, reflects the Army's 
changing attitude regarding 
women in the Armed Forces. 
Currently serving as Mechani- 
cal Maintenance Platoon 
Leader, Cunningham super- 
vises and directly controls her 
own platoon containing doz- 
ens of soldiers. Furthermore, 
Lieutenant Cunningham acts 
as the unit nuclear, biological, 
and chemical (NBC) warfare 
officer, as well as mobiliza- 
tion officer. Also, Lieutenant 
Cunningham has helped with 
implementing new programs 
as directed by the Commander, 
One of these programs is 
physical training, where oc- 
casionally Lieutenant Cun- 
ningham has led aerobics for 
the unit. This program drew 
mixed responses from many 
of the unit’s soldiers, who 
range in age from seventeen 
years to retirement. 

Unlike many of the soldiers 
in the 1071st, Lieutenant 
Cunningham does not live in

We apologize if you were unable to buy an Avalanche 
recently, The morning after the May 8th fires, we ordered 
a couple hundred newspapers above our normal run or 
5,000 and sold out that week. 

The next issue with nearly six full pages of forest fire

5.700 printed. 

Last week, for the May 24th issue, we ordered 5,500 
and we still have newspapers available for the first ime 
in three weeks. 

Because of the extraordinary number of requests for 
copies of those two issues that were sold out, we've put 
together a special Avalanche forest fire reprint. Eight

the May 10, May 17, May 24, and today’s issues have

Thanks To 
A Lot Of People 


We could never begin to 
thank enough all the people, 
merchants, and departments 
that helped us after losing our 
home in the May 8th fire. 

To all the relatives that took 
us in; the friends and relatives 
who gave us money, food, and 
clothing; the Red Cross, who 
directed us to St. Mary’s 
Church where we were given 
food, clothing and linen; the

1 wonder if the younger housewives of today really 
appreciate the convenience and work-saving of their 
automatic washers and dryers. Compared to the old days 
doing the laundry today is a breeze, Let’s look back at 
how it was done in the good old days. Monday was the 
traditional wash day, and when I was a boy Monday 
moming was a dreaded time. You had to get up early and 
see to it the wood box was filled and a lot of water had to 
be pumped to fill the wash boiler and various other 

: containers that were used to heat the wash water. When 

all was ready, I was off to schoo! while Morn was faced 

f with a day of backbreaking labor. 

j When the water was hot enough, she filled the wash 

j tubs and shaved some of her home made lye soap in to the 

water, The old scrub board got a real workout as each 
piece of laundry was scrubbed clean, As cach piece was 
cleaned it was ran through the crank tumed wringer into 


local merchants who gave &@ ; : 
food and clothing, the firc- am et oe . 
men, National Guard, police [ai “ Pr ee 
departments, the D.N.R., and : &.. ge 
all volunteers who all risked ‘ ® a. 
their lives to save people and . 
their homes; the people local 
and distant who banned to- 
gether to help us and others in 
our situation... our hearts go 
out to all of you.

REFORESTATION—Carrie Trudgeon, 20, of Grayling, and Angie Parker, 19, of Roscommon, are 
shown planting jack pine seedlings to replace the Kirtland’s warbler habitat lost in the May 8th fire. As 
of Wednesday afternoon, the four member Michigan Youth Corps crew had planted over 7,000 trees. The 
project will continue for about three weeks. Not pictured are Henry Cousins and Scott Cochman, of 
Grayling.

the rinse water. When a good bunch had gathered in the 
rinse water, the old clothes stomper was used to clean the 
soap from them. The clothes stomper looked about like 
a metal toilct plunger. The clothes were ran through the 
wringer again into the wash basket and carried outside to 
hang on the line to dry. Good housewives took great pride 
in the whiteness and brightness of their laundry and 
worked hard to hang the cleanest laundry in the neighbor- 
hood. Even in winter clothes were hung out as freezing 
tended to help them dry. Doing the laundry for a good 
sized family meant a day of hard work for the moms of 
that day. 

When the electric washer came along to help, it was 
hailed as the greatest labor saving machine known to the 
ladies of that day. It climinated the scrub board and the 
hand cranked wringer. For the farm women before the 
days of R.E.A., May Tag had a washer that was powered 
by a small gas engine. Many farm ladies of that day had 
a powerful right leg from tromping on the kick starter of 
those old May Tags. 

The housewife of those days may have had hands that 
were rough and red from the scrub board and lye soap as 
she tried to keep her family in clean clothes, even if they 
were patch upon patch. 

So ladies, when it comes time to count your blessings 
don't forget to include the automatic washers and dryers 
of today. 

Tuesday was the day when the housewives of the day 
did the ironing. In those days our wash and wear and 
permanent press clothes were just a dream. Heating the 
irons on the stove to iron each item meant another day of 

backbreaking work in those days. 

So ladies, as you do your laundry with the modem 
appliances we enjoy today, think of how grandma had to 
work to gethers done, Thank God you’re not living back 
in the Good Ole Days?

Almanac 
By Richard Milliman 


Campaign law is unrealistic 


REGARDLESS OF WHETHER Gov. James Blan- 
chard is “officially” a candidate for reelection this year, 
the campaign certainly is underway in eamest. 

It’s ridiculous, of course, for the governor to declaim 
he is not yet a “candidate” for governor — at least, not 
officially. 

He claims he has not formally “announced his candi- 
dacy,” so therefore he is not a candidate. 

This claim comes despite the fact that he has been 
raising moncy for his reelection campaign, has in place a 
campaign manager and nearly-full staff for his reelection 
efforts, has fited three times as many signatures as needed 
on nominating petitions to secure a place on the August 
primary ballot and has even launched a television adver- 
lising campaign for his reelection. 

Is he a candidate for governor? Sure he is... and has 
been for months. Is he conducting a campaign? Sure he 
is... and has been for months. 

But the governor stil! plans to “announce” his candi- 
dacy in the next week or so, with all the pomp and fanfare 
“an official announcement” usually commands. 

* * * 

WHAT’S GOING ON here? Apparently it’s ail a 
matter of money. 

As long as Mr. Blanchard is not “a candidate,” there- 
fore most things he does are in his role as governor, and 
the taxpayer foots the bill. 

Whenever he does something that is overtly political 
—~ such as travel to a Democratic fundraising dinner, for 
cxample — then he tums off the “governor” sign, flips on 
the “politics” sign, and the campaign organization foots 
the bill. 

But he has not officially “announced” as a candidate, 
so he can get away with a lot of govemor-type activities 
which are border-line politics, at taxpayer expense. 

Under Michigan campaign laws, candidates for gover- 
nor who choose to receive state funds for their campaign 
must live within certain spending limits. 

Thus, the more activities which the governor can 
pursuc as govemor, but which also benefit him as “‘can- 


didate”, — ifhe ever chooses to become one, of course — 
the higher the limits he can spend once he actually 
becomes a “candidate.” 

* * * 

THERE IS A SCHOOL of reasoning which argues 
that everything an office holder does, no matter the 
intention, has political effect, and therefore can be con- 
sidered political in nature. 

When Mr. Blanchard, as governor, inspects some state 
projects — such as prison bootcamp, for example — is it 
political, or is it just doing his job? When Mr, Blanchard 
visits a home town fair or festival — such as the Holland 
Tulip Festival, for example — is it as “‘a candidate” or as 
governor of all the people? 

It’s a close call in both cases. 

The law should be realistic. Once a candidate files 
petitions, starts running ads, puts a staff in place, then he/ 
she is acandidate, regardicss of whether there has been a 
formal announcement. Maybe thal time comes even 
sooner. 

Mr. Blanchard is not the only incumbent who hides 
within the letter of the law; but, as governor, he’s the most 
visible one right now, 

If Mr. Blanchard is acting within the Jaw in his cam- 
paign activitics of recent weeks, then the law should be 
changed to reflect what’s really going on.

NUTS AND JOLTS — Some column closers from

eyes have it, then the nose. 

—One man in a thousand is aleader of men; the rest of 
us usually follow women,

But there is another side to 
the coin, {tis also essential 
that you Carly understand 
responsibilities you have 
under Social Security. Here 
are some prime examples: 

-~When you file a claini- 
Benefits are not paid automati- 
cally when you become dis- 
abled, retire, or afier your 
death. An application must be 
filed with Social Security, and 
the necessary evidence sub- 
mitted. Social Security repre- 
sentatives will explain whatis 
necded, and it’s up to the 
applicant to cooperate fully in 
providing proofs or informa- 
tron, 

-~While you're getting 
henefits- You must promptly 
report events that may affect 
your payments, Forexample, 
notify Social Security when 
you change your address: 
expect your carnings from 
work to exceed the allowable 
limit (orany amountif you get 
benefits because you are dis- 
abled); if you marry or di- 
vorce, or if you begin receiv- 
Ing, OF get an increase in, a 
public disability pension, 
workers’ compensation, or 
non-Socnul Security covered 
pension, 

There may be other respon- 
sibilities involving Social 
Security too, For instance, 
you now need to show a So- 
cial Security number on the 
Federal tax return for cach 
listed dependent who ts age 2 
and over. And, if you change 
your name, you should apply 
for a replacement Social Sc- 
curity card showing your new 
name. 

People who receive Sup- 
plemental Security Income 
(SSI) have additional report- 
ing responsibilities, tncluding 
changes in income, resources, 
and living arrangements. 

For more information, or to 
report a change, call Social 
Security toll-free at 800-234- 
5772 from 7:00.a.m. until 7:00 
p.m,, weekdays. 

The Traverse City office is

tional holidays.

or career enticements. It’s not really a 
contest. There’s room for both.

Fire! The mere mention of 
the word can bring shear ter- 
ror into a person’s heart and 
mind. Too many people in 
this areca have had a taste of 
that terrible fright and the 
tearing anguish that goes with 
it, We can, and have, helped 
with money and asympathetic 
ear, but the stilling terror can- 
not be quenched so casily. 

Thank heaven we don't give 
up easily, that there is a resil- 
ience which makes many want 
lo start over again, knowing 
full well that some things lost, 
will never be reptaced. Itisa 
good thing that our ancestors 
were resilient too, because 
wildfire has, along with its 
aftermath, been with usa very 
long time in this state. 

In the fall of 1871, fires 
badly damaged Holland and 
Manistee and then, pushed by 
very strong westerly winds, 
coupled with extremely dry 
conditions, burned across the 
state into the city of Port 
Huron. The fire destroyed the 
major portions of 21 countics 
in just two days. That fire 
combined with other fires in 
the state consumed 14,000 
square miles of Michigan for- 
est along with towns, and 
numerous lives, during 1871. 
Those fires burned over the 
equivalent of 24 Crawford 
Countics.

Shelley Hubbard at the Coop-

2841, ext. 265. 

The 4-H Exploration Days 
are set for June 20, 21, 22nd 
and will be held at the Michi- 
gan State University. The

but you can think about this 
for next year. 

I want to mention some 


items for the Achievement 
Day. We really appreciated 
Mr. Edward Schultz for his 
efforts in getting the pictures 
ready for the paper. It was 
really nice of him to volunteer 
his ime on short notice. We 
thank each of those businesses 
for announcing the Achieve- 
ment Day and making it no- 
ticeable to the public. Thanks 


GRADUATION TIME—D. A. R. E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) eraduation-en was held for 172 
fifth grade students last Tuesday. The Grayling Middle School program is sponsored by the Crawford 
County Sheriff Dept., Kiwanis Club, Grayling Youth Booster Club, Rotary Club, Michigan Prosecutor’s 
Assoc., Michigan Assoc. of Chiefs of Police and Michigan Sheriff’s Assoc. 


fansen s 


Clyde's acne 


go out to those who helped in 
other ways that this writer is 
not aware of. 

Next, I'd like to mention 
about the Poultry Hatching 
Projectin Mrs. Shirley McEv- 
ers’ 3rd grade class. They 
started incubation on May Ist 
with 14 cggs. The students 
learned about the devclopment 
of a chicken and when they 
hatched the students learned 
how to feed and water and 


as care for the Banty chickens. 


Their early arrival a coupie of 
weeks ago Surprised the class. 
The nine chicks that hatched 
came on a weekend and ev- 
eryone saw them on Monday 
retuming toclass, The young 
people were able to see some 
“candling” where they saw an 
embryo moving. Mrs. Karen 
Lanseth built an egg project 
on the 25th so that each stu- 
dentcould lear about the parts 
of an egg. The cggs were 
donated by the 4-H Poultry 
Club led by Sharon Hadley 
and Donna Pratt. The chick- 
ens will be returning there 
when the project ends. 

This year’s Cross Country 
Ski Club was led by Linda 
Starks, She had 14 kids of 
various ages five and up. The 
five year olds had a parent es- 
cort. Thanks go to Sharon 
Birdsall forhelping. The club 
started in January and stopped 


Page 13 -- AVALANCHE -- Thursday, MAY 31, 


when the snow ended. They 
met at the Cross Country Ski 
Shop behind the Holiday Inn 
and the cost was only $2.00 
for ski equipment rental. 
These were not lessons teach- 
ing skling, but a fun time to 
get together and also intro- 
duce the kids to cross country 
skiing. A lot of falls, bumps, 
and laughter happened often. 
The owners of the Cross 
Country Ski Shop came out 
occasionally to give some tips 
and they were very much 
appreciated. Although paren- 
tal help was short, Linda did 
manage tokeep the club oper- 
ating but is not sure of next 
year. So volunteer your time 


if you can. 
] just want to mention thal 
the tour of  Chicf 


Shoppenagon’s on the 12th 
for the Food and Fitness Club 
was very nice. We appreci- 
ated Chef Carlene Englund for 
answering questions and 
showing us around. Also it 
was kind of Mary Harland to 
give cach of us an ink pen and 
a coupon, 


THANK YOU 
We would tike to thank our 


friends for their cards, flow-— 


ersand kindness atour time of 
sorrow.

The Bible Speaks» 


I John 2:1-6 
Part #5 
Victory Over Sin 


God reminds us that our 
lives as Christians should, be 
characterized by righteeus- 
ness and holiness. “My little 
children, these things write | 
unto you, that yc sin not. And 
if any man sin, we have an 
advocate with the Father, Je- 
sus Christ the rightcous.” (I 
John 2:1). A holy God has 
called us unto holiness. (I 
Peter 1:15, 16). Sin isto be an 
exception rather than a prac- 
tice orrule in Christian living. 
Every Christian has the com- 
fort of knowing he/she has an 
advocate or altorney in 
Heaven to resist the accusa- 
tions of Satan against us. 

As our advocate and me- 


diator (I Tim. 2:5), our Lord 


Jesus Christ became the pro- 
pitiation for our sins, This 
remission of our sins was 
through His shed blood. 


(Romans 3:25, 26). He took 
our sins and gave us his right- 
cousness. (2Cor. 5:21). “And 
he is the propitiation for our 
sins: and not for ours only, 
but also for the sins of the 
whole world.” (I John 2:2). 
He is not only our savior, but 
He is the only savior of the 
whole world.” (I John 4:14). 
There is but one savior, advo- 
cate, and mediator to handic 
the sins of humanity, our Lord 
Jesus Christ. We are only 
reconciled to God through 
faith in Jesus Christ. (2 Cor. 
$:18-20). 

Victory over sin is not only 
characicrized by rightcous- 
ness and reconciliation, but 
also by rightliving, One who 
does not live like a Christian, 
gives no evidence of being a 
Christian. ‘And hereby we do 
know that we know him, if we 
keep his commandments. He 
that saith, I know him, and 
keepeth not his command- 
ments, isa liar,and the truth is 


From n Calvary Raps hire 


not in him.” (John 2:3, 4), 
Christian life is evident by 
Christian obedience. 

Right living gives evidence 
of Christian love within, “But 
whoso keepeth his word, in 
him verily is the love of God 
perfected: hereby know we 
that we arc in him.” (I John 
2:5). “Jesus answered and 
said unto him, If @ man love 
me, he will keep my words: 
and my Father will love him, 
and we will come unto him, 
and make our abode with 
him.” (John 14:23). Chris- 
tian love is evident by Chris- 
tian obedience. 

Right living gives evidence 
of Christian lordship within. 
“He that saith he abidcth in 
him ought himself also so to 
walk, even as he walked.” (1 
John 2:6). We cannot call 
Him Lord and not follow Him 
inobedience. Christian Lord- 
ship of Jesus Christ is evident 
by Christian obedience. As 
Jesus said, “And why call ye 


me, Lord, Lord, and donot the 
things which I say?” (Luke 
6:46). 

It is victory over sin which 
gives outward cvidence of the 
life, love, and lordship of Je- 
sus Christ in our lives. (Hear

Imagine that you are sinnalng Ina’ 
giant redwood forest in California. Re- *: 
markably, one of these trees may have 
started to grow in 549 A.D., nine hun- 
dred and forty three years before Colum- 
bus discovered America, and continues 
to thrive today, fourteen hundred and 
forty one years since it began as a seed- 
ling. Almost unbelievably, this redwood 
tree has survived incredible natural and 
manmade turbulence, growing to an 
average height of two hundred and fifty 
feet, with a trunk twelve feet in diameter. 

Continue to cast your eyes upward. 
The foliage is dense, but you may catcha 
glimpse of the heavens beyond the tree 
tops. 

Now, consider God’s love. He created 
the redwoods. He created the universe 
and all that is In it. God’s love is so great 
that its dimensions are immeasurable. 

Discover God’s enduring love as you 
worship Him at your church or eyes 
gogue this week, God's love lives on. 
and on.. . forever.
