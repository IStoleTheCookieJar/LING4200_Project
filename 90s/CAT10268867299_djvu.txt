1/  Based  on  prices  at  test  as  reported  in  "Agricultural  Prices,"  National  Agricultural  Statistics  Service  (NASS);  converted  to  a 
3.5  percent  test  by  using  the  butterfat  differential  specified  in  Federal  milk  orders  for  conversion  of  the  blend  prices  that  vary 
from  3.5  percent.  2/  "Agricultural  Prices,"  NASS.  3/  Animals  sold  for  dairy  herd  replacement  only.  4/  Figures  are  published 
for  January,  April,  July,  and  October  only.  5/  Mid-month  price.  6/  Includes  beef  cows  and  cull  dairy  cows  sold  for  slaughter, 
but  not  dairy  cows  for  herd  replacement.  7/  Pounds  of  16  percent  mixed  dairy  feed  equal  in  value  to  1  pound  of  milk  sold  to 
plants.  The  methodology  utilizes  major  raw  feed  component  prices  from  the  NASS  agricultural  commodity  prices  published
