3.  As  royalty.  Lessee  covenants  and  agrees:  (a)  To  deliver  to  the  credit  of  Lessor,  in  the  pipelines  to  which  Lessee  may  connect  its  wells,  the  equal  20%  part 
of  all  oil  produced  and  saved  by  Lessee  from  said  land,  or  from  time  to  time,  at  the  option  of  Lessee,  to  pay  Lessor  the  average  posted  market  price  of  such  20%  part  of 
such  oil  at  the  wells  as  of  the  day  it  is  run  to  the  pipe  line  or  storage  tanks,  Lessor's  interest,  in  either  case,  to  bear  20%  of  the  cost  of  treating  oil  to  render  it  marketable 
pipe  line  oil;  (b)  to  pay  Lessor  for  gas  and  casinghead  gas  produced  from  said  land  (1)  when  sold  by  Lessee,  20%  of  the  amount  realized  by  Lessee,  computed  at  the 
mouth  of  the  well,  or  (2)  when  used  by  Lessee  off  said  land  or  in  the  manufacture  of  gasoline  or  other  products,  20%  of  the  amount  realized  from  the  sale  of  gasoline  or 
other  products  extracted  therefrom  and  20%  of  the  amount  realized  from  the  sale  of  residue  gas  after  deducting  the  amount  used  for  plant  fuel  and/or  compression;  (c) 
To  pay  Lessor  on  all  other  minerals  mined  and  marketed  or  utilized  by  Lessee  from  said  land,  one-tenth  either  in  kind  or  value  at  the  well  or  mine  at  Lessee's  election, 
except  that  on  sulphur  mined  and  marketed  the  royalty  shall  be  one  dollar  ($1.00)  per  long  ton.  If  at  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  or  at  any  time  or  times 
thereafter,  there  is  any  well  on  said  land  or  on  lands  with  which  said  land  or  any  portion  thereof  has  been  pooled,  capable  of  producing  oil  or  gas,  and  all  such  wells  are 
shut-in,  this  lease  shall,  nevertheless,  continue  in  force  as  though  operations  were  being  conducted  on  said  land  for  so  long  as  said  wells  are  shut-in,  and  thereafter  this 
lease  may  be  continued  in  force  as  if  no  shut-in  had  occurred.  Lessee  covenants  and  agrees  to  use  reasonable  diligence  to  produce,  utilize,  or  market  the  minerals 
capable  of  being  produced  from  said  wells,  but  in  the  exercise  of  such  diligence,  lessee  shall  not  be  obligated  to  install  or  furnish  facilities  other  than  well  facilities  and 
ordinary  lease  facilities  of  flow  line,  separator,  and  lease  tank,  and  shall  not  be  required  to  settle  labor  trouble  or  to  market  gas  upon  terms  unacceptable  to  lessee.  If,  at 
any  time  or  times  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  all  such  wells  are  shut-in  for  a  period  of  ninety  consecutive  days,  and  during  such  lime  there  are  no  operations 
on  said  land,  then  at  or  before  the  expiration  of  said  ninety  day  period.  Lessee  shall  pay  or  tender,  by  check  or  draft  of  Lessee,  as  royalty,  a  sum  equal  to  one  dollar 
($1.00)  for  each  acre  of  land  then  covered  hereby.  Lessee  shall  make  like  payments  or  tenders  at  or  before  the  end  of  each  anniversary  of  the  expiration  of  said  ninety 
day  period  if  upon  such  anniversary  this  lease  is  being  continued  in  force  solely  by  reason  of  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph.  Each  such  payment  or  tender  shall  be 
made  to  the  parties  who  at  the  time  of  payment  would  be  entitled  to  receive  the  royalties  which  would  be  paid  under  this  lease  if  the  wells  were  producing,  and  may  be 
deposited  or  paid  directly  to  lessor  or  their  successors,  which  shall  continue  as  the  depositories,  regardless  of  changes  in  the  ownership  of  shut-in  royalty.  If  at  any  time 
that  Lessee  pays  or  tenders  shut-in  royalty,  two  or  more  parties  are.  or  claim  to  be,  entitled  to  receive  same,  Lessee  may,  in  lieu  of  any  other  method  of  payment  herein 
provided,  pay  or  tender  shut-in  royalty,  in  the  manner  above  specified,  either  jointly  to  such  parties  or  separately  to  each  in  accordance  with  their  respective  ownerships 
thereof,  as  lessee  may  elect.  Any  payment  hereunder  may  be  made  by  check  or  draft  of  Lessee  deposited  in  the  mail  or  delivered  to  the  party  entitled  to  receive 
payment  or  to  a  depository  bank  provided  tor  above  on  or  before  the  last  date  for  payment.  Nothing  herein  shall  impair  Lessee's  right  to  release  as  provided  in 
paragraph  5  hereof.  In  the  event  of  assignment  of  this  lease  in  whole  or  part,  liability  for  payment  hereunder  shall  rest  exclusively  on  the  then  owners  of  this  lease, 
severally  as  to  acreage  owned  by  each. 

4.  Lessee,  at  its  option,  is  hereby  given  the  right  and  power  to  pool  or  combine  the  acreage  covered  by  this  lease  or  any  portion  thereof  as  to  oil  and  gas,  or 
either  of  them,  with  any  other  land  covered  by  this  lease,  and/or  with  any  other  land,  lease  or  leases  in  the  immediate  vicinity  thereof  to  the  extent  hereinafter  stipulated, 
when  in  Lessee's  judgment  it  is  necessary  or  advisable  to  do  so  in  order  properly  to  explore,  or  to  develop  and  operate  said  leased  premises  in  compliance  with  the 
spacing  rules  of  the  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas,  or  other  lawful  authority,  or  when  to  do  so  would,  in  the  judgment  of  Lessee,  promote  the  conservation  of  oil  and 
gas  in  and  under  and  that  may  be  produced  from  said  premises.  Units  pooled  for  oil  hereunder  shall  not  substantially  exceed  40  acres  each  in  area,  and  units  pooled  for 
gas  hereunder  shall  not  substantially  exceed  in  area  640  acres  each  plus  a  tolerance  of  ten  percent  (10%)  thereof,  provided  that  should  governmental  authority  having 
jurisdiction  prescribe  or  permit  the  creation  of  units  larger  than  those  specified,  for  the  drilling  or  operation  of  a  well  at  a  regular  location  or  for  obtaining  maximum 
allowable  from  any  well  to  be  drilled,  drilling  or  already  drilled,  units  thereafter  created  may  conform  substantially  in  size  with  those  prescribed  or  permitted  by 
governmental  regulations.  Lessee  under  the  provisions  hereof  may  pool  or  combine  acreage  covered  by  this  lease  or  any  portion  thereof  as  above  provided  as  to  oil  in 
any  one  or  more  strata  and  as  to  gas  in  any  one  or  more  strata.  The  units  formed  by  pooling  as  to  any  stratum  or  strata  need  not  conform  in  size  or  area  with  the  unit  or 
units  into  which  the  lease  is  pooled  or  combined  as  to  any  other  stratum  or  strata,  and  oil  units  need  not  conform  as  to  area  with  gas  units.  The  pooling  in  one  or  more 
instances  shall  not  exhaust  the  rights  of  the  Lessee  hereunder  to  pool  this  lease  or  portions  thereof  into  other  units.  Lessee  shall  file  for  record  in  the  appropriate  records 
of  the  county  in  which  the  leased  premises  are  situated  an  instrument  describing  and  designating  the  pooled  acreage  as  a  pooled  unit;  and  upon  such  recordation  the  unit 
shall  be  effective  as  to  all  parties  hereto,  their  heirs,  successors  and  assigns,  irrespective  of  whether  or  not  the  unit  is  likewise  effective  as  to  all  other  owners  of  surface, 
mineral,  royalty,  or  other  rights  in  land  included  in  such  unit.  Lessee  may  at  its  election  exercise  its  pooling  option  before  or  after  commencing  operations  for  or 
completing  an  oil  or  gas  well  on  the  leased  premises,  and  the  pooled  unit  may  include,  but  it  is  not  required  to  include,  land  or  leases  upon  which  a  well  capable  of 
producing  oil  or  gas  in  paying  quantities  has  theretofore  been  completed  or  upon  which  operations  for  the  drilling  of  a  well  for  oil  or  gas  have  theretofore  been 
commenced.  In  the  event  of  operations  for  drilling  on  or  production  of  oil  or  gas  from  any  part  of  a  pooled  unit  which  includes  all  or  a  portion  of  the  land  covered  by 
this  lease,  regardless  of  whether  such  operations  for  drilling  were  commenced  or  such  production  was  secured  before  or  after  the  execution  of  this  instrument  or  the 
instrument  designating  the  pooled  unit,  such  operations  shall  be  considered  as  operations  for  drilling  on  or  production  of  oil  or  gas  from  land  covered  by  this  lease 
whether  or  not  the  well  or  wells  be  located  on  the  premises  covered  by  this  lease  and  in  such  event  operations  for  drilling  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  commenced  on 
said  land  within  the  meaning  of  paragraph  5  of  this  lease:  and  the  entire  acreage  constituting  such  unit  or  units,  as  to  oil  and  gas,  or  either  of  them,  as  herein  provided, 
shall  be  treated  for  all  purposes,  except  the  payment  of  royalties  on  production  from  the  pooled  unit,  as  if  the  same  were  included  in  this  lease.  For  the  purpose  of 
computing  the  royalties  to  which  owners  of  royalties  and  payments  out  of  production  and  each  of  them  shall  be  entitled  on  production  of  oil  and  gas,  or  either  of  them, 
from  the  pooled  unit,  there  shall  be  allocated  to  the  land  covered  by  this  lease  and  included  in  said  unit  (or  to  each  separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  lease  covers 
separate  tracts  within  the  unit)  a  pro  rata  portion  of  the  oil  and  gas,  or  cither  of  them,  produced  from  the  pooled  unit  after  deducting  that  used  for  operations  on  the 
pooled  unit.  Such  allocation  shall  be  on  an  acreage  basis  -  that  is,  there  shall  be  allocated  to  the  acreage  covered  by  this  lease  and  included  in  the  pooled  unit  (or  to  each 
separate  tract  within  the  unit  if  this  lease  covers  separate  tracts  within  the  unit)  that  pro  rata  portion  of  the  oil  and  gas,  or  either  of  them,  produced  from  the  pooled  unit 
which  the  number  of  surface  acres  covered  by  this  lease  (or  in  each  such  separate  tract)  and  included  in  the  pooled  unit  bears  to  the  total  number  of  surface  acres 
included  in  the  pooled  unit.  Royalties  hereunder  shall  be  computed  on  the  portion  of  such  production,  whether  it  be  oil  and  gas,  or  either  of  them,  so  allocated  to  the 
land  covered  by  this  lease  and  included  in  the  unit  just  as  though  such  production  were  from  such  land.  The  production  from  an  oil  well  will  be  considered  as 
production  from  the  lease  or  oil  pooled  unit  from  which  it  is  producing  and  not  as  production  from  a  gas  pooled  unit;  and  production  from  a  gas  well  will  be  considered 


as  production  from  the  lease  or  gas  pooled  unit  from  which  it  is  producing  and  not  from  an  oil  pooled  unit.  The  formation  of  any  unit  hereunder  shall  not  have  the 
effect  of  changing  the  ownership  any  shut-in  production  royalty  which  may  become  payable  under  this  lease.  If  this  tease  now  or  hereafter  covers  separate  tracts,  no 
pooling  or  unitization  of  royalty  interest  as  between  any  such  separate  tracts  is  intended  or  shall  be  implied  or  result  merely  from  the  inclusion  of  such  separate  tracts 
within  this  lease  but  Lessee  shall  nevertheless  have  the  right  to  pool  as  provided  above  with  consequent  allocation  of  production  as  above  provided.  As  used  in  this 
paragraph  4,  the  words  "separate  tract"  mean  any  tract  with  royalty  ownership  differing,  now  or  hereafter,  either  as  to  parties  or  amounts,  from  that  as  to  any  other  part 
of  the  leased  premises. 

5.  If  at  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral  is  not  being  produced  on  said  land,  or  from  the  land  pooled  therewith,  but  Lessee  is  then 
engaged  in  drilling  or  reworking  operations  thereon,  or  shall  have  completed  a  dry  hole  thereon  within  60  days  prior  to  die  end  of  the  primary  term,  the  lease  shall 
remain  in  force  so  long  as  operations  on  said  well  or  for  drilling  ot  reworking  of  any  additional  well  are  prosecuted  with  no  cessation  of  more  than  60  consecutive  days, 
and  if  they  result  in  the  production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral,  so  long  thereafter  as  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  is  produced  from  said  land,  or  from  land  pooled  therewith. 
If,  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term  of  this  lease  and  after  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral  is  produced  from  said  land,  or  from  land  pooled  therewith,  the  production 
thereof  should  cease  from  any  cause,  this  lease  shal]  not  terminate  if  Lessee  commences  operations  for  drilling  or  reworking  within  60  days  after  the  cessation  of  such 
production,  but  shall  remain  in  force  and  effect  so  long  as  such  operations  are  prosecuted  with  no  cessation  of  more  than  60  consecutive  days,  and  if  they  result  in  the 
production  of  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral,  so  long  thereafter  as  oil,  gas,  or  other  mineral  is  produced  from  said  land,  or  from  land  pooled  therewith.  Any  pooled  unit 
designated  by  Lessee  in  accordance  with  the  terms  hereof,  may  be  dissolved  by  Lessee  by  instrument  fded  for  record  in  the  appropriate  records  of  the  county  in  which 
the  leased  premises  are  situated  at  any  time  after  the  completion  of  a  dry  hole  or  the  cessation  of  production  on  said  unit.  In  the  event  a  well  or  wells  producing  oil  or 
gas  in  paying  quantities  should  be  brought  in  on  adjacent  land  and  within  330  feet  of  and  draining  the  leased  premises,  or  land  pooled  therewith,  Lessee  agrees  to  drill 
such  offset  well  or  wells  as  a  reasonably  prudent  operator  would  drill  under  the  same  or  similar  circumstances.  Lessee  may  at  any  time  execute  and  deliver  to  Lessor  or 
place  of  record  a  release  or  releases  covering  any  portion  or  portions  of  the  above  described  premises  and  thereby  surrender  this  lease  as  to  such  portion  or  portions  and 
be  relieved  of  all  obligations  as  to  the  acreage  surrendered. 

6.  Lessee  shall  have  the  right  at  any  time  during  or  after  the  expiration  of  the  lease  to  remove  all  property  and  fixtures  placed  by  Lessee  on  said  land, 
including  the  right  to  draw  and  remove  all  casing.  When  required  by  Lessor,  Lessee  will  bury  all  pipe  lines  below  ordinary  plow  depth,  and  no  well  shall  be  drilled 
within  two  hundred  (200)  feet  of  any  residence  or  bam  now  on  said  land  without  Lessor's  consent. 

7.  The  rights  of  either  party  hereunder  may  be  assigned  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  the  provisions  hereof  shall  extend  to  their  heirs,  successors  and  assigns;  but 
no  change  or  division  in  ownership  of  the  land,  or  royalties,  however  accomplished,  shall  operate  to  enlarge  the  obligations  or  diminish  the  rights  of  Lessee;  and  no 
change  or  division  in  such  ownership  shall  be  binding  on  Lessee  until  thirty  (30)  days  after  Lessee  shall  have  been  furnished  by  registered  U.  S.  mail  at  Lessee's 
principal  place  of  business  with  a  certified  copy  of  recorded  instrument  or  instruments  evidencing  same.  In  the  event  of  assignment  hereof  in  whole  or  part,  liability  for 
breach  of  any  obligation  hereunder  shall  rest  exclusively  upon  the  owner  of  this  lease  or  a  portion  thereof  who  commits  such  breach.  If  six  or  more  parties  become 
entitled  to  royalty  hereunder.  Lessee  may  withhold  payment  thereof  unless  and  until  furnished  with  a  recordable  instrument  executed  by  all  such  parties  designating  an 
agent  to  receive  payment  for  all. 

8.  The  breach  by  Lessee  of  any  obligation  arising  hereunder  shall  not  work  a  forfeiture  or  termination  of  this  lease  nor  cause  a  termination  or  reversion  of 
the  estate  created  hereby  nor  be  grounds  for  cancellation  hereof  in  whole  or  in  part.  No  obligation  reasonably  to  develop  the  leased  premises  shall  arise  during  the 
primary  term.  Should  oil,  gas  or  other  mineral  in  paying  quantities  be  discovered  on  said  premises,  then  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term.  Lessee  shall  develop 
the  acreage  retained  hereunder  as  a  reasonably  prudent  operator,  but  in  discharging  this  obligation  it  shall  in  no  event  be  required  to  drill  more  than  one  well  per  forty 
(40)  acres  of  the  area  retained  hereunder  and  capable  of  producing  oil  in  paying  quantities  and  one  well  per  640  acres  plus  an  acreage  tolerance  not  to  exceed  10%  of 
640  acres  of  the  area  retained  hereunder  and  capable  of  producing  gas  or  other  mineral  in  paying  quantities.  If  after  the  expiration  of  the  primary  term,  Lessor  considers 
that  operations  are  not  at  anytime  being  conducted  in  compliance  with  this  lease,  Lessor  shall  notify  Lessee  in  writing  of  the  facts  relied  upon  as  constituting  a  breach 
hereof,  and  Lessee,  if  in  default,  shall  have  sixty  days  after  receipt  of  such  notice  in  which  to  commence  the  compliance  with  the  obligations  imposed  by  virtue  of  this 
instrument. 

9.  Lessor  hereby  warrants  and  agrees  to  defend  the  title  to  said  land  and  agrees  that  Lessee  at  its  option  may  discharge  any  tax,  mortgage  or  other  lien  upon 
said  land,  either  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  in  event  Lessee  does  so,  it  shall  be  subrogated  to  such  lien  with  right  to  enforce  same  and  apply  royalties  accruing  hereunder 
toward  satisfying  same.  Without  impairment  of  Lessee's  rights  under  the  warranty  in  event  of  failure  of  title,  it  is  agreed  that  if  this  lease  covers  a  less  interest  in  the  oil, 
gas,  sulphur,  or  other  minerals  in  all  or  any  part  of  said  land  than  the  entire  and  undivided  fee  simple  estate  (whether  Lessor's  interest  is  herein  specified  or  not),  or  no 
interest  therein,  then  the  royalties  and  other  monies  accruing  from  any  part  as  to  which  this  lease  covers  less  than  such  full  interest,  shall  be  paid  only  in  the  proportion 
which  the  interest  therein,  if  any,  covered  by  this  lease,  bears  to  the  whole  and  undivided  fee  simple  estate  therein.  All  royalty  interest  covered  by  this  lease  (whether  or 
not  owned  by  Lessor)  shall  be  paid  out  of  the  royalty  herein  provided.  Should  any  one  or  more  of  the  parties  named  above  as  Lessors  fail  to  execute  this  lease,  it  shall 
nevertheless  be  binding  upon  the  party  or  parties  executing  the  same. 

10.  Should  Lessee  be  prevented  from  complying  with  any  express  or  implied  covenant  of  this  lease,  from  conducting  drilling  or  reworking  operations 
thereon  or  from  producing  any  oil,  gas  or  other  minerals  therefrom  by  reason  of  scarcity  of  or  inability  to  obtain  or  to  use  equipment  or  material,  or  by  operation  of 
force  majeure,  and  Federal  or  state  law  or  any  order,  rule  or  regulation,  including  zoning  or  permitting  rules  of  any  governmental  authority,  then  while  so  prevented,
