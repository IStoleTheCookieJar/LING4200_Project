1220.0 - ANZSCO - Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations, 2013, Version 1.3 
ARCHIVED ISSUE Released at 11:30 AM (CANBERRA TIME) 05/11/2019 


Explanatory Notes Related Information Past Releases 


Page tools: a!) Print Page 


What's New The ABS and StatsNZ have completed an investigation largely focussed on skill levels assigned to 
occupations in ANZSCO. Changes have been made, where appropriate, to better reflect contemporary 
requirements in the Australian and New Zealand labour markets. While most changes relate to either moving 
the indicative skill level up or down one level, some occupations retained their indicative skill level but a note 
has been included to acknowledge that some roles in that occupation are at a higher level.

Other changes relate to updating registration and licensing requirements for some occupations; updating 
specialisations, alternative titles and example occupation titles in Not Elsewhere Classified (nec) categories; 
and removal of instances of (Aus) or (NZ) which follow some occupation titles, where removal is not likely to 
cause confusion.

Search ANZSCO Titles SEARCH FACILITY 
A feature of ANZSCO is the availability of a web-based search function. Simply type in a keyword/s and a list 
of possible ANZSCO codes and occupation titles is displayed. Once the most appropriate code and title is 
located, click the code to show the occupation definition. 


This search facility is intended to help users find occupation definitions. As such, it is not suitable for use as 
the principal means of assigning ANZSCO codes to occupation information obtained from sources such as 
statistical collections, human resource management records or job vacancy advertisements. 


The titles used in ANZSCO are intended to convey the clearest possible idea of the nature of the particular 
occupation. However, in some instances, the same job titles are used by different industries to describe 
different occupations (e.g. business analyst). The search facility is also not an exhaustive list of all titles used 
by people to describe an occupation (e.g. brickie). 


Users wanting to assign ANZSCO codes to occupation information are advised to use the relevant computer 
coding systems developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and StatsNZ.

OVERVIEW 


What's New 
Contents 


shoul thie REIGATE The Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) is the product of a 


Expanded Contents development program undertaken jointly by a project team from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 
Search ANZSCO Titles StatsNZ and the then Australian Government Department of Education, Employment and Workplace 
Relations for use in the collection, publication and analysis of occupation statistics. Revisions were 
undertaken in 2009, 2013 and in 2019 a refresh of skill levels was conducted by the ABS and StatsNZ. 


ANZSCO provides a basis for the standardised collection, analysis and dissemination of occupation data for 
Australia and New Zealand. The use of ANZSCO has resulted in improved comparability of occupation 
statistics produced by the two countries. 


ANZSCO replaces the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO) Second Edition and the New 
Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (NZSCO) 1999 used in Australia and New Zealand, 
respectively. ANZSCO is intended to provide an integrated framework for storing, organising and reporting 
occupation-related information in both statistical and client-oriented applications, such as matching job 
seekers to job vacancies and providing career information. 


ANZSCO has been used in ABS and StatsNZ censuses and surveys where occupation data are collected 
from 2006. ANZSCO has also been progressively introduced into administrative data collections. 


BACKGROUND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANZSCO 


In support of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, the ABS and StatsNZ 
have a policy of working towards developing harmonised statistical classifications. 


The benefits of developing a joint occupation classification were noted as being the ability to produce a more 
up-to-date, relevant and conceptually sound classification, and the improved capacity for analysis of trans- 
Tasman labour market data. 


The development of ANZSCO commenced in 2002 as a joint project between the ABS, StatsNZ and the then 
Australian Government Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. 


Formal consultations with stakeholders in Australia and New Zealand were undertaken between 2002 and 
2005. These consultations informed stakeholders of progress and sought their views on a number of key 
issues affecting the overall design and structure of ANZSCO. 


Early in the development of ANZSCO, it was necessary to agree on a common basis for harmonising the 
classification across the two countries recognising that some restructuring, expansion and contraction of the 
existing classifications would be necessary. For Australian users, a high level of comparability was maintained 
with ASCO Second Edition, by minimising the extent to which ASCO Second Edition unit groups were split 
and re-aggregated when designing ANZSCO unit groups. 


UNDERSTANDING ANZSCO 


To assist users to understand the detailed structure and content of ANZSCO, and to assist in interpreting 
statistics classified to it, the following information has been provided: 


explanation of the conceptual basis of ANZSCO 

description of the principal differences between ANZSCO and ASCO Second Edition and NZSCO 1999 
explanation of the classification structure and codes 

explanation of the format of the ANZSCO occupation and group definitions 

definitions for all major, sub-major, minor and unit groups and occupations 


UPDATES TO ANZSCO 


An important consideration when developing a statistical classification is the need to build in sufficient 
robustness to allow for long-term usage. This robustness facilitates meaningful time series analysis of data 
assigned to that classification. 


It is recognised that, for non-statistical uses of ANZSCO, there is a need for a classification which reflects the 
contemporary labour markets in Australia and New Zealand. To meet this need, minor updates to ANZSCO 
have been undertaken. 


To minimise disruption to time series data, updates are made at the occupation and possibly the unit group 
level. Updates take the form of including newly-emerged occupations and/or unit groups, merging occupations 
and/or unit groups with other occupations and/or unit groups, deleting declining occupations and/or unit 
groups or changing titles or descriptions of occupations and/or unit groups. 


ANZSCO Version 1.3 


In 2019, the ABS and StatsNZ undertook a refresh of skill level statements in ANZSCO which focussed on 
updating, where necessary, the skill levels assigned to occupations. Each occupation in ANZSCO is assigned 
an Indicative Skill Level to reflect the range and complexity of tasks usually performed in that occupation. Skill 
Level is measured by the level of formal educational attainment, relevant work experience and on the job 
training. The term Indicative Skill Level is deliberately used throughout ANZSCO to alert users to the fact that 
skill level is not simply a function of formal education and that the skills possessed by workers classified to a 
particular occupation are not identical. Occupations are assigned a skill level ranging from Skill Level 1 
(highest) to Skill Level 5 (lowest). Over time, the skills required for competent performance of occupations can 
change and the main purpose of the Refresh was to reflect this change. 


The creation or deletion of occupations or moving occupations to a different part of the classification was out 
of scope of the 2019 refresh. Changes that would affect the classification's structure or conceptual basis were 
also out of scope. 


Changes were made by way of promoting or demoting the skill level or the inclusion of a note stating that 
some roles within an occupation are at a higher skill level to the indicative skill level. To illustrate, some single 
occupation categories contain a range of jobs (ie. sets of tasks) which vary in terms of their complexity. For 
example, Aged and Disabled Carers is a single occupation in ANZSCO covering both carers for the aged and 
the disabled, with some workers requiring more and/or different skills. While there is an overlap of tasks 
performed by these workers there are differences which should be recognised. Because splitting occupations 


was out of scope, the ABS and StatsNZ agreed on the indicative skill level required for workers employed in 
this occupation category and added a note that some roles in that occupation would require a higher skill 
level. For Aged and Disabled Carers, the indicative skill level was left at Skill Level 4 but it is now noted some 
roles in that occupation are Skill Level 3. 


Occupation registration and licensing requirements were updated for some occupations and other minor 
changes involved adding, deleting or changing the name of example occupation titles in the Not Elsewhere 
Classified occupations. This was done on the basis of occupation title responses in Australian and New 
Zealand Censuses. Instances of (Aus) or (NZ) appearing after an occupation title (to denote that a title applies 
in only one country) have been removed except where deletion is likely to cause confusion. 


CODING OCCUPATION INFORMATION 


By themselves, the classification structure and the definitions are not intended as the primary means of 
assigning information about particular jobs to ANZSCO classes. Care needs to be taken when assigning 
information about particular jobs to ANZSCO classes because the same job titles can be used in different 
industries to describe different occupations (e.g. business analyst). Additionally, the titles used in ANZSCO 
are not an exhaustive list of all titles used by people to describe an occupation (e.g. brickie). 


To consistently and reliably allocate occupation information from responses in statistical collections to the 
correct position in the ANZSCO structure, the minimum information required is occupation title and tasks 
performed. Restricted use can also be made of industry of employment and employer information when it is 
available. 


Further information on ANZSCO can be obtained from the ABS National Information and Referral Service 
(1300 135 070) or client.services@abs.gov.au or StatsNZ Information Centre on 0508 525 525 or 


info@stats.govt.nz. 


Coding queries should be directed to standards@abs.gov.au or coding@stats.govt.nz.

Contents >> Conceptual Basis of ANZSCO 
SCOPE OF THE CLASSIFICATION 


What's New 
Contents 


shoul thie REIGATE The scope of ANZSCO is all occupations and jobs in the Australian and New Zealand labour markets 


Expanded Contents undertaken for pay or profit, including jobs occupied by people working for themselves. 
Search ANZSCO Titles 


ANZSCO is not designed to cover work not undertaken for pay or profit, for example voluntary work. However, 
this does not preclude ANZSCO from describing such activities. 


Occupations that are wholly illegal in New Zealand and all States and Territories of Australia are excluded 
from ANZSCO. 


OVERVIEW OF ANZSCO STRUCTURE 


The structure of ANZSCO has five hierarchical levels - major group, Sub-major group, minor group, unit group 
and occupation. The categories at the most detailed level of the classification are termed ‘occupations’. These 
are grouped together to form ‘unit groups’, which in turn are grouped into 'minor groups’. Minor groups are 

aggregated to form 'sub-major groups’ which in turn are aggregated at the highest level to form ‘major groups’. 


These are the same hierarchical levels that were used in ASCO Second Edition and NZSCO 1999. 


CONCEPTUAL MODEL 


ANZSCO is a skill-based classification used to classify all occupations and jobs in the Australian and New 
Zealand labour markets. 


To do this, ANZSCO identifies a set of occupations covering all jobs in the Australian and New Zealand labour 
markets, defines these occupations according to their attributes and groups them on the basis of their 
similarity into successively broader categories for statistical and other types of analysis. The individual objects 
classified in ANZSCO are jobs. 


In ANZSCO, occupations are organised into progressively larger groups on the basis of their similarities in 
terms of both skill level and skill specialisation. 


The conceptual model adopted for ANZSCO uses a combination of skill level and skill specialisation as criteria 
to design major groups which are meaningful and useful for most purposes. The eight major groups are 
formed by grouping together sub-major groups using aspects of both skill level and skill specialisation. In 
designing the major groups, intuitive appeal and usefulness in both statistical and administrative applications 
were also important considerations. 


The skill level criterion is applied as rigorously as possible at the second level of the classification, the sub- 
major group level, together with a finer application of skill specialisation than that applied at the major group 
level. Each sub-major group is made up of a number of minor groups. 


Minor groups are distinguished from each other mainly on the basis of a finer application of skill specialisation 
than that applied at the sub-major group level. Within minor groups, unit groups are distinguished from each 
other on the basis of skill specialisation and, where necessary, skill level. 


Within unit groups, the distinction between occupations relates to differences between tasks performed in 
occupations and in most unit groups all occupations are at one skill level. 


The distinctions between the various levels of ANZSCO are summarised in the following paragraphs. 


MAJOR GROUP 


Major groups are: 


e the broadest level of ANZSCO 
e formed using a combination of skill level and skill specialisation to create groups which are meaningful 
and useful for most (statistical and administrative) purposes. 


SUB-MAJOR GROUP 
Sub-major groups are: 


e subdivisions of the major groups 
e distinguished from other sub-major groups in the same major group on the basis of skill level and a broad 
application of skill specialisation. 


MINOR GROUP 
Minor groups are: 


e subdivisions of the sub-major groups 
e distinguished from other minor groups in the same sub-major group mainly on the basis of a less broad 
application of skill specialisation. 


UNIT GROUP 
Unit groups are: 


e subdivisions of the minor groups 
e distinguished from other unit groups in the same minor group on the basis of a finer application of skill 
specialisation and, where necessary, skill level. 


OCCUPATION 
Occupations are: 


e the most detailed level of ANZSCO 

e subdivisions of the unit groups 

e distinguished from other occupations in the same unit group on the basis of detailed skill specialisation 
and, occasionally, skill level 

e sets of jobs which involve the performance of a common set of tasks. 


UNDERLYING CONCEPTS 


As noted in Conceptual model, the framework adopted for ANZSCO is based on the concepts of ‘job’ and 
‘occupation’. The concept of ‘occupation’ is based on the concepts of ‘skill level’ and ‘skill specialisation’. 


Understanding these concepts is fundamental to understanding ANZSCO. These concepts are defined in the 
following sections. 


The concept of job 


A ‘job’ is defined as a set of tasks designed to be performed by one person for an employer (including self- 
employment) in return for payment or profit. Individual persons are classified by occupation through their 
relationship to a past, present or future job. 


Any particular job will typically involve an individual working for a particular employer and undertaking a 
particular set of tasks. People working for themselves are considered as having a job and belonging to the 
labour force. 


The concept of occupation 


The categories at the most detailed level of the ANZSCO structure are called ‘occupations’. An ‘occupation’ is 
defined as a set of jobs that require the performance of similar or identical sets of tasks. As it is rare for two 
actual jobs to have identical sets of tasks, in practical terms, an ‘occupation’ is a set of jobs whose main tasks 
are characterised by a high degree of similarity. 


The similarity of tasks is defined in ANZSCO as a function of the level and specialisation of skill required to 
perform those tasks. Skill is defined as the ability to competently perform the tasks associated with an 
occupation. 


It follows that ANZSCO classifies occupations according to two criteria - skill level and skill specialisation. 


The concept of skill level 


In ANZSCO, skill level is defined as a function of the range and complexity of the set of tasks performed ina 
particular occupation. The greater the range and complexity of the set of tasks, the greater the skill level of an 


occupation. 


Skill level is measured operationally by: 


e the level or amount of formal education and training 
e the amount of previous experience in a related occupation, and 
e the amount of on-the-job training 


required to competently perform the set of tasks required for that occupation. 


In general, the greater the range and complexity of the set of tasks involved, the greater the amount of formal 
education and training, previous experience and on-the-job training required to competently perform the set of 
tasks for that occupation. 


Formal education and training refers to the level and amount of education and training required for competent 
performance of the tasks required in an occupation. It is measured in terms of educational qualifications as set 
out in the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) and the New Zealand Qualifications Framework (NZQF). 


Previous experience refers to the time spent gaining work experience in related occupations or activities 
required for the competent performance of the tasks in an occupation. It is measured in months or years. 


On-the-job training refers to the amount of training required after commencing work in an occupation for 
competent performance of the tasks in that occupation. It is measured in months or years, and may be 
undertaken at the same time as formal training. 


ANZSCO does not measure the skill level of an individual, rather it refers to the level of skill that is typically 
required to competently perform the tasks of a particular occupation. Skill level is an attribute of occupations, 
not of individuals in the labour force or of particular jobs. It is irrelevant whether a particular individual working 
in a job in a particular occupation has a certain amount of training or a particular level of competence or not. 


For example, a person who spreads mortar and lays bricks for a living has the occupation Bricklayer, 
regardless of whether he or she is an exceptionally competent bricklayer with many years of experience and 
post-trade qualifications, or an inexperienced bricklayer with no formal qualifications and a low level of 
competence. The skill level of the occupation Bricklayer is determined on the basis of that typically required 
for competent performance. 


ANZSCO assigns occupations to one of five skill levels. In determining the skill level of each occupation in 
ANZSCO, advice was sought from employers, industry training bodies, professional organisations and others 
to ensure that the information is as accurate and meaningful as possible. The determination of boundaries 
between skill levels is based on the following definitions. 


SKILL LEVEL 1 


Occupations at Skill Level 1 have a level of skill commensurate with a bachelor degree or higher qualification. 
At least five years of relevant experience may substitute for the formal qualification. In some instances 
relevant experience and/or on-the-job training may be required in addition to the formal qualification. 


SKILL LEVEL 2 


Occupations at Skill Level 2 have a level of skill commensurate with one of the following: 


e NZQF Diploma or 
e AQF Associate Degree, Advanced Diploma or Diploma. 


At least three years of relevant experience may substitute for the formal qualifications listed above. In some 
instances relevant experience and/or on-the-job training may be required in addition to the formal qualification. 


SKILL LEVEL 3 


Occupations at Skill Level 3 have a level of skill commensurate with one of the following: 
e NZQF Level 4 qualification 
e AOF Certificate IV or 


e AQF Certificate III including at least two years of on-the-job training. 


At least three years of relevant experience may substitute for the formal qualifications listed above. In some 
instances relevant experience and/or on-the-job training may be required in addition to the formal qualification. 


SKILL LEVEL 4 


Occupations at Skill Level 4 have a level of skill commensurate with one of the following: 


e NZQF Level 2 or 3 qualification or 
e AOF Certificate II or Ill. 


At least one year of relevant experience may substitute for the formal qualifications listed above. In some 
instances relevant experience may be required in addition to the formal qualification. 


SKILL LEVEL 5 


Occupations at Skill Level 5 have a level of skill commensurate with one of the following: 
e NZQF Level 1 qualification 
e AOF Certificate | or 


e compulsory secondary education. 


For some occupations a short period of on-the-job training may be required in addition to or instead of the 
formal qualification. 


In some instances, no formal qualification or on-the-job training may be required. 


The concept of skill specialisation 


Skill specialisation is defined as a function of: 


field of knowledge required 

tools and equipment used 

materials worked on, and 

goods or services produced or provided. 


Field of knowledge required refers to the subject matter knowledge that is essential for satisfactory 
performance of the tasks of an occupation. 


Tools and equipment used includes all forms of plant, machinery, computer-based equipment or hand tools 
used in the performance of the tasks, as well as intellectual tools such as personal interaction, and art or 
design techniques. 


e The term plant is used to describe mobile or stationary equipment which is large in size, performs several 
related functions, and is usually controlled by an internally located operator. 

e The term machinery is used to describe stationary equipment which is not as large as plant, performs one 
processing function and is usually controlled by an externally located operator. 

e The term hand tools is used to describe equipment which is small enough to be moved by one person. 


Materials worked on refers to materials of both a tangible and abstract nature which are extracted, processed, 
transformed, refined or fabricated as an essential part of the tasks performed. Examples of materials worked 
on include wood, metal, livestock, accounting data, text, people and organisations. 


Goods or services produced or provided refers to the end product of the performance of the tasks of an 
occupation including physical goods, personal or other services, or abstract goods such as a software 
application or statistical information. 


Employability skills 


In developing the skill specialisation criteria for ANZSCO, employability skills were considered as a possible 
additional dimension of skill specialisation. There are two facets to employability skills, personal attributes 
such as loyalty, commitment and motivation, and generic skills, including communication, team work and 
problem-solving. Employers are increasingly using employability skills in conjunction with technical or job- 
specific skills when assessing the suitability of an individual for a particular occupation. Since these 
employability skills are applicable to most occupations, it was decided not to include them as classification 
criteria for ANZSCO. 


DESIGN CONSTRAINTS 


One of the primary purposes of a statistical classification is to provide a simplification of the real world, which 
is a useful framework for collecting and analysing data from both statistical and administrative collections. To 
achieve this end, there are a number of practical considerations which impinged on the design of ANZSCO. 


Statistical balance 


As a general principle, a classification used for the dissemination of statistics should not have categories at 
the same level in its hierarchy which are too disparate in their population size. That is, similar numbers of real 
world entities should be classified to each category at a particular level. This approach serves to minimise 
large variations in standard errors and the suppression of cells in statistical tables at particular levels of the 
structure when using output from sample surveys. It also allows the classification to be used effectively for the 
cross-tabulation of aggregate data. 


Categories which have been defined to reflect the real world, however, will not always be statistically 
balanced. To force categories to conform to size limitations would mean that the categories would not always 
be meaningful or useful. 


In developing ANZSCO, a balance between these competing requirements was sought. The following 
minimum and maximum size guidelines were considered in designing the categories at each level of 


ANZSCO. For inclusion in ANZSCO, a category ideally fitted within the range listed below for either Australia 
or New Zealand. 


Australia New Zealand 
Major Group 500,000 to 1,500,000 100,000 to 300,000 
Sub-Major Group 100,000 to 300,000 30,000 to 100,000 
Minor Group 50,000 to 150,000 10,000 to 30,000 
Unit Group 5,000 to 30,000 3,000 to 10,000 
Occupation 300 to 10,000 100 to 5,000 


Some exceptions, however, were made for occupations, or groups of occupations, of particular strategic or 
labour market significance. 


Statistical feasibility 
Another consideration affecting the design of ANZSCO was the statistical feasibility of the categories. That is, 
whether it is possible to accurately and consistently distinguish between the categories in the classification on 


the basis of responses to questions which can reasonably be asked in statistical collections such as 
population censuses and labour force surveys. 


Time series comparability with ASCO Second Edition 


Early in the development of ANZSCO, it was decided to try to maintain comparability, as far as practical, with 
ASCO Second Edition at the unit group level. This was achieved by minimising the extent to which ASCO 
Second Edition unit groups were split and re-aggregated when designing ANZSCO unit groups. 


It was acknowledged that doing so would result in a major time series break from NZSCO 1999 for New 


Zealand users at all levels of the classification.

MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANZSCO AND ASCO SECOND EDITION 


While the classification criteria for ANZSCO are essentially the same as those used for ASCO Second Edition, 
the application of the skill level criterion has changed. In ASCO Second Edition, the skill level required for 

entry to an occupation was considered. In ANZSCO, it is the skill level required for competent performance of 
the set of tasks associated with the occupation which is used. 


The use of both skill level and skill specialisation to define the major groups in ANZSCO compared to just skill 
level in ASCO Second Edition has resulted in major groups which are more intuitively appealing and useful 
than their ASCO Second Edition predecessors. Accordingly, there have been changes to the way some 


occupations are classified in ANZSCO. 


Associate Professionals 


This ASCO Second Edition major group has been discontinued in ANZSCO. These occupations have been 
spread across a number of ANZSCO major groups. The major changes are: 


Science, Engineering and Related Associate Professionals, ASCO Second Edition Sub-Major Group 31, are 
classified to ANZSCO Major Group 3 Technicians and Trades Workers, Sub-Major Group 31 Engineering, ICT 
and Science Technicians. 


Finance Associate Professionals, ASCO Second Edition Minor Group 321, are classified to ANZSCO Major 
Group 2 Professionals, Minor Group 222 Financial Brokers and Dealers, and Investment Advisers. 


Office Managers, ASCO Second Edition Unit Group 3291, and Project and Program Administrators, ASCO 
Second Edition Unit Group 3292, are classified to ANZSCO Major Group 5 Clerical and Administrative 
Workers, Sub-Major Group 511 Office Managers and Program Administrators. 


Managing Supervisors (Sales and Service), ASCO Second Edition Sub-Major Group 33, are mainly classified 
to ANZSCO Major Group 1 Managers, Sub-Major Group 14 Hospitality, Retail and Service Managers. 


Health and Welfare Associate Professionals, ASCO Second Edition Sub-Major Group 34, are classified to 
ANZSCO Major Group 4 Community and Personal Service Workers, Sub-Major Group 41 Health and Welfare 
Support Workers. 


Clerical, sales and service occupations 


ASCO Second Edition Major Group 5 Advanced Clerical and Service Workers, Major Group 6 Intermediate 
Clerical, Sales and Service Workers, and Major Group 8 Elementary Clerical, Sales and Service Workers 
have been disaggregated and reorganised in ANZSCO into three intuitively appealing major groups. 


There is now one major group which covers all clerical occupations - Major Group 5 Clerical and 
Administrative Workers, one major group which covers all sales occupations - Major Group 6 Sales Workers, 
and one major group which covers all service workers - Major Group 4 Community and Personal Service 
Workers. 


Information and communication technology (ICT) occupations 


ANZSCO identifies a greater number of ICT unit groups and occupations compared to ASCO Second Edition. 


In ANZSCO Versions 1.2 and 1.3, there are 13 ICT unit groups and 37 ICT occupations. This compares to 
three unit groups and nine occupations in ASCO Second Edition. 


Apprentices, trainees and supervisors 


ASCO Second Edition identified a number of apprentice, trainee and supervisory occupations. ANZSCO does 
not separately identify such occupations. 


In ANZSCO, apprentice and trainee occupations are classified together with their ‘parent’ or future occupation. 
Supervisory occupations are classified together with the occupations whose tasks they supervise. 


MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANZSCO AND NZSCO 1999 


While the classification criteria for ANZSCO are essentially the same as those used for NZSCO 1999, 
ANZSCO provides a greater definition of skill level, and the application of the skill level criterion is more 
rigorous compared to NZSCO 1999. The structure and conceptual basis of NZSCO 1999 was closer to that of 
the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) than ANZSCO. 


The introduction of ANZSCO has resulted in there being more occupations than contained in NZSCO 1999. It 
has also meant major changes to the way some occupations were classified in NZSCO 1999. Some of the 
major changes are listed below. 


Agriculture and Fishery Workers 


This NZSCO 1999 major group has been discontinued in ANZSCO. These occupations have been spread 
across a number of ANZSCO major groups. The major changes are: 


Farmers and farm managers are classified to ANZSCO Major Group 1 Managers, Sub-Major Group 12 
Farmers and Farm Managers. 


Farm and forestry workers are classified to ANZSCO Major Group 8 Labourers, Sub-Major Group 84 Farm, 


Forestry and Garden Workers. 


Gardeners, greenkeepers and nurserypersons are classified to ANZSCO Major Group 3 Technicians and 
Trades Workers, Minor Group 362 Horticultural Trades Workers. 


Gardening and nursery labourers are classified to ANZSCO Major Group 8 Labourers, Sub-Major Group 84 
Farm, Forestry and Garden Workers. 


Associate Professionals 


This NZSCO 1999 major group has been discontinued in ANZSCO. These occupations have been spread 
across a number of ANZSCO major groups. The major changes are: 


Physical Science and Engineering Associate Professionals, NZSCO 1999 Sub-Major Group 31, are mostly 
classified to ANZSCO Major Group 3 Technicians and Trades Workers, Sub-Major Group 31 Engineering, ICT 
and Science Technicians. 


Ship and Aircraft Controllers and Technicians, NZSCO 1999 Minor Group 314, are classified to ANZSCO 
Major Group 2 Professionals, Minor Group 231 Air and Marine Transport Professionals. 


Life Science Technicians and Related Workers, NZSCO 1999 Minor Group 321, are classified to ANZSCO 
Major Group 3 Technicians and Trades Workers, Sub-Major Group 31 Engineering, ICT and Science 
Technicians. 


Health Associate Professionals, NZSCO 1999 Minor Group 322, and Nursing Associate Professionals, 
NZSCO 1999 Minor Group 323, are classified to ANZSCO Major Group 2 Professionals, Sub-Major Group 25 
Health Professionals, and Major Group 4 Community and Personal Service Workers, Sub-Major Group 41 
Health and Welfare Support Workers. 


Writers, Artists, Entertainment and Sports Associate Professionals, NZSCO 1999 Minor Group 336, are 
classified to ANZSCO Major Group 2 Professionals, Sub-Major Group 21 Arts and Media Professionals, and 
Major Group 4 Community and Personal Service Workers, Sub-Major Group 45 Sports and Personal Service 
Workers. 


Sales and service occupations 


NZSCO 1999 Major Group 5 Service and Sales Workers has been disaggregated and reorganised in 
ANZSCO into two major groups. 


There is now one major group which covers all sales occupations - Major Group 6 Sales Workers, and one 
major group which covers all service workers - Major Group 4 Community and Personal Service Workers. 


Information and communication technology (ICT) occupations 


ANZSCO identifies a greater number of ICT unit groups and occupations compared to NZSCO 1999. 


In ANZSCO Versions 1.2 and 1.3, there are 13 ICT unit groups and 37 ICT occupations. This compares to two 
minor groups, three unit groups and seven occupations in NZSCO 1999. 


COMPARABILITY WITH ISCO 


ISCO was developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO). ISCO was first issued in 1958 and 
revised versions were produced in 1968, 1988 and 2008. The main aims of ISCO are to provide a basis for 
international comparisons of occupation statistics between member countries and to provide a conceptual 
model for the development of national occupation classifications. 


The current edition, ISCO-08, uses skill level and skill specialisation as criteria in the conceptual framework for 
the classification. Four broad skill levels are used, defined in terms of the educational categories and levels 
that appear in the International Standard Classification of Education 1976, published by the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. 


Comparison between ANZSCO and ISCO 


The following table indicates the number of categories at each level of ANZSCO and ISCO 


Hierarchical Level ANZSCO Version 1.3  ANZSCO Revision 1 ANZSCO ISCO-08 ISCO-88 


Major Group 8 8 8 10 10 
Sub-Major Group 43 43 43 43 28 
Minor Group 97 97 97 130 116 
Unit Group 358 358 358 436 390 
Occupation 1023 1014 998 - - 


The occupation level is not defined in ISCO-08, as it is expected that individual countries will develop this level 
of detail to suit their requirements. 


The following table compares the major group titles for ANZSCO and ISCO-08. Note that this table does not 
provide a correspondence between the two classifications. 


ANZSCO ISCO-08 

1 Managers 1 Managers 

2 Professionals 2 Professionals 

3 Technicians and Trades Workers 3 Technicians and Associate Professionals 

4 Community and Personal Service Workers 4 Clerical Support Workers 

5 Clerical and Administrative Workers 5 Services and Sales Workers 

6 Sales Workers 6 Skilled Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery Workers 
7 Machinery Operators and Drivers 7 Craft and Related Trades Workers 

8 Labourers 8 Plant and Machine Operators and Assemblers 


9 Elementary Occupations 
0 Armed Forces Occupations 


The ten major groups in ISCO-08 are broadly similar to the eight ANZSCO major groups. The most significant 
differences at major group level are: 


ISCO-08 identifies Skilled Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery Workers as a separate major group (Major Group 
6), whereas ANZSCO includes Farmers and Farm Managers as a sub-major group in Major Group 1 
Managers; Skilled Animal and Horticultural Workers as a sub-major group in Major Group 3 Technicians and 
Trades Workers; and Farm, Forestry and Garden Workers as a sub-major group in Major Group 8 Labourers. 


ISCO-08 Major Group 3 Technicians and Associate Professionals (and equivalent major groups in ASCO 
Second Edition and NZSCO 1999) has no equivalent in ANZSCO. 


A major group of Community and Personal Service Workers has been introduced for ANZSCO and has no 
equivalent in ISCO-08. 


In ISCO-08, jobs held by members of the armed forces are included in Major Group 0 Armed Forces. In 
ANZSCO, jobs held by members of the armed forces are classified with their civilian equivalents, where these 
exist, or to a number of defence force specific occupations.

Contents >> Classification Structure 


PROFILE AND SUMMARY OF ANZSCO STRUCTURE 

The structure of ANZSCO has five hierarchical levels - major group, sub-major group, minor group, unit group and occupation. The categories at the 
most detailed level of the classification are termed ‘occupations’. These are grouped together to form ‘unit groups’, which in turn are grouped into 
‘minor groups’. Minor groups are aggregated to form 'sub-major groups’ which in turn are aggregated at the highest level to form 'major groups’. 


These are the same hierarchical levels that are used in ASCO Second Edition and NZSCO 1999. 


The following is a profile of the ANZSCO structure with hierarchy descriptions and examples. The complete listing of the major, sub-major, minor and 
unit groups and occupations follows later in this chapter. 


Major Groups are: 
- the broadest level of ANZSCO 
Major Group 3 Technicians and - denoted by 1-digit codes 
Trades Workers - formed using a combination of skill level and skill 


specialisation to create groups which are meaningful 
and useful for most purposes 


There are 8 Major Groups 


Sub-Major Groups are: 
Sub-Major Group 32 ee 


i. 2.) O08 PR: 


- denoted by 2-digit codes (the relevant major group Sub-Major Group 5s 
code plus an additional digit) Construction Trades Workers 
- distinguished from other sub-major groups in the 
same major group on the basis of skill level anda 
broad application of skill specialisation 


Automotive and Engineering Trades 
Workers 


There are 43 Sub-Maior Groups 


Minor Groups are: 

- subdivisions of the sub-major groups 

- denoted by 3-digit codes (the relevant sub-major 
group code plus an additional digit 

- distinguished from other minor groups in the same 
sub-major group mainly on the basis of a less broad 
application of skill specialisation 


Minor Group 331 
Bricklayers, and Carpenters and 
Joiners 


Minor Group 321 
Automotive Electricians and 
Mechanics 


There are 97 Minor Groups 
; Unit Groups are: ; 
Unit Group 3211 - subdivisions of the minor groups Unit Group 3311 
Automotive Electricians - denoted by 4-digit codes (the relevant minor group Bricklayers and Stonemasons 


code plus an additional digit) 

- distinguished from other unit groups in the same 
minor group mainly on the basis of a finer application 
of skill specialisation and, where necessary, skill level 


There are 358 Unit Groups 
Occupations are: 
Occupation 321111 - subdivisions of the unit groups Occupation 331111 
Automotive electrician - denoted by 6-digit codes (the relevant unit group Bricklayer 


code plus an additional 2 digits) 

- distinguished from other occupations in the same 
unit group mainly on the basis of detailed skill 
specialisation 

- sets of jobs which involve the performance of a 
common set of tasks 


There are 1023 Occupations 


Each major group comprises a different number of sub-major, minor and unit groups and occupations. The following table illustrates the distribution 
of these categories between the major groups. 


Major Group Sub-Major Groups Minor Groups Unit Groups Occupations 


1 Managers 4 11 38 99 
2 Professionals 7 23 100 318 
3 Technicians and Trades Workers 7 21 66 179 
4 Community and Personal Service Workers 5 9 36 105 
5 Clerical and Administrative Workers 7 12 33 80 
6 Sales Workers 3 5 19 37 
7 Machinery Operators and Drivers 4 7 22 77 
8 Labourers 6 9 44 128 


STANDARD CODE SCHEME 
One, two, three, four and six-digit codes are assigned to the major, sub-major, minor and unit groups, and occupations respectively. 


Within each major group, the sub-major groups are ordered firstly by skill level and then alphabetically. Note: some updates in Version 1.3 have 
broken this practice, however as any changes to the structure of the classification were out of scope of the update, the existing ordering (from 
Version 1.2) has been retained. Residual ‘other’ sub-major groups are listed last. Sub-major groups comprising occupations at multiple skill levels 
have been ordered firstly on the basis of their highest predominant skill level, then alphabetically. 


Within each sub-major group, the minor groups are ordered alphabetically, with the exception of residual ‘miscellaneous’ minor groups which are 
listed last. Similarly, within each minor group, the unit groups are ordered alphabetically, with the exception of the residual ‘other’ unit groups which 
are listed last. 


The occupations within each unit group are essentially in alphabetical order, with the exception of 'general' occupations which are listed first, and 
residual 'not elsewhere classified’ (nec) categories which are listed last. This ordering is more expedient than necessary and it is not considered that 
the addition of any new occupations, which may disrupt this ordering, will affect the usefulness of the classification. 


The occupational profile of Australia and New Zealand is likely to change over time due to factors such as technological change and changes in the 
industrial profile of Australia and New Zealand. Therefore, from time to time, it may be necessary to add or delete occupations from the list of 
occupations separately identified in ANZSCO. 


If it becomes necessary to identify an additional unit group or occupation, it will be allocated the next available four or six-digit code in the numerical 
sequence of codes of the minor or unit group to which it is being added. Similarly, if a unit group or occupation ceases to have sufficient numbers of 
persons employed to justify it continuing to be separately identified in the classification and it is consequently deleted from the classification, its code 
would not be reallocated as this would be likely to cause confusion with time series data. 


It should be noted that the separately identified occupations are not allocated codes ending with the digits '0' or '9'. These are special purpose codes 
used to denote supplementary or operational (not further defined) codes in the case of '0' and residual (not elsewhere classified) categories in the 
case of '9' (see Supplementary or operational codes and Codes reserved for residual categories). 


The ANZSCO code scheme is devised so that any future changes to the classification structure can be easily accommodated. However, in order that 
the classification remains a standard, users should not make arbitrary changes to the structure. Rather, they should contact the ABS or Statistics NZ 
and identify any apparent problems they encounter in the course of implementation, data collection or data analysis. ANZSCO will be revised at a 
suitable time so that all users continue to use the standard classification. 


Codes reserved for residual categories 


For each unit group of the classification structure, a six-digit code, consisting of the four digits of the unit group followed by the digits ‘99’, is reserved 
as a residual 'not elsewhere classified’ (nec) category. All occupations which are not separately identified in the classification structure are included 
in the 'nec' category of the unit group to which they relate. Residual categories are only identified in the classification structure if they are needed. 
ANZSCO currently identifies 79 'nec' categories. 


The decision to include particular occupations in an 'nec' category rather than as substantive categories is based on their lack of numerical 
significance in Australia or New Zealand. 


For each minor group, codes are reserved for residual categories at the unit group level. These codes consist of the minor group code followed by 
'9'. These categories are termed ‘Other’ and consist of separately identified occupations which do not fit into any of the unit groups contained within 
the minor group, on the basis of the classification criteria. The classification contains 21 ‘other’ categories at the unit group level. 


For each sub-major group, codes are also reserved for residual categories at the minor group level. These codes consist of the sub-major group 
code followed by '9'. These categories are termed ‘Miscellaneous’ and consist of separately identified unit groups which do not fit into any of the 
minor groups contained within the sub-major group, on the basis of the classification criteria. The classification contains eight 'miscellaneous' 
categories at the minor group level. 


For each major group, codes are reserved for residual categories at the sub-major group level. These codes consist of the major group code 
followed by '9'. These categories are termed ‘Other' and consist of separately identified minor groups which do not fit into any of the sub-major 
groups contained within the major group, on the basis of the classification criteria. The classification contains three ‘other’ categories at the sub- 
major group level. 


It should be noted that residual categories are part of the ANZSCO structure. They should not be created or used merely to 'dump' responses that 
cannot be coded to any separately identified category in the classification because of insufficient detail in the response. See Supplementary or 
operational codes. 


Supplementary or operational codes 


Supplementary or operational codes are used in statistical collections to process inadequately described responses or for responses which are 
outside of the scope of the classification. 


In Australia, these codes are of two types: 


e six digit codes ending in two, three, four or five zeros; and 
e six digit codes commencing with one zero. 


Codes ending in zero are described as ‘not further defined’ (nfd) codes and are used to code responses which cannot be coded to the occupation 
level of the classification, but which can be coded to a higher level of the classification structure. 


For example, responses which cannot be identified as relating directly to a particular occupation category, but which are known to be within the 
range of occupations within a particular unit group are coded to that unit group. Such responses are allocated an nfd code consisting of the four-digit 
code of the unit group followed by ‘00’. For instance, the response ‘Internal Medicine Specialist’ does not contain sufficient information to be coded 
directly to any particular occupation category, but it can be coded to Unit Group 2533 Specialist Physicians, which encompasses all internal 


medicine specialists. It is thus allocated the code 253300 Specialist Physicians, nfd. 
Codes commencing with zero are used to process responses which do not provide sufficient information to be coded to any level of the structure. 
They are also used to process responses such as ‘housewife’, ‘pensioner’ and ‘student’, which are not covered by the current definition of the labour 
force (see Standards for Labour Force Statistics, ABS cat. no. 1288.0). The standard set of such codes used in the ANZSCO Coding Index is 
available on request from the ABS. 
Other codes commencing with zero may be defined by users to facilitate the processing and storage of data, when data sets coded to ANZSCO 
contain records for entities outside the scope of ANZSCO. For example, occupational activities which are wholly illegal in New Zealand and all States 
and Territories of Australia are excluded from ANZSCO. 
In New Zealand, codes commencing with the digits '99' are used as supplementary or operational codes. 
e The code '997000' is used for legitimate/valid responses, such as ‘public servant’, which cannot be coded to any single occupation category 
because there is insufficient supporting information to accurately code to a specific category. This code is called ‘Response Unidentifiable’. 
e The code '999000' is used for responses, such as ‘housewife’, ‘pensioner’ or ‘student’, which are not covered by the current definition of the 
labour force. This code is called ‘Response Outside Scope’. 
e The code '999999' is used for non-response. This code is called ‘Not Stated’. 


It should be noted that supplementary or operational codes are not part of the classification structure. They exist for operational reasons only, and no 
data would be coded to them if sufficiently detailed responses or responses within the scope of the classification were obtained in all instances. 


EXPLANATORY NOTES 


The detailed structure of ANZSCO at each descending level of the classification can be found under the Downloads tab. This also shows the 
relationship between the groups and skill level. 


The first three tables (Major Groups, Sub-Major Groups and Minor Groups) show the predominant skill levels applying to each group. 
In the next two tables (Unit Groups and Occupations), all skill levels applying to each group are shown. 


A definitive list of all skill levels applying to each group in the classification is found in the definition for that group. See Definitions.

INTERPRETING ANZSCO OCCUPATION DEFINITIONS 


What's New 
Contents 


shoul thie REIGATE ANZSCO is primarily a statistical classification designed to aggregate and organise data collected about jobs 


Expanded Contents or individuals. The classification definitions are based on the skill level and specialisation usually necessary to 

Search ANZSCO Titles perform the tasks of the specific occupation, or of most occupations in the group. The definitions and skill level 
statements apply to the occupation and not persons working in the occupation. The allocation of a particular 
occupation to a particular skill level should be seen as indicative only and should not be used prescriptively. 


The definitional material describing each occupation is intended primarily as an aid to interpreting occupation 
statistics classified to ANZSCO. The descriptions are, therefore, only a guide to the tasks undertaken and 
skills involved in various occupations and are not a definitive statement of what is required. 


FORMAT OF THE DEFINITIONS 


This classification contains definitions for all major, sub-major, minor and unit groups, and occupations. The 
format of the definitions may vary slightly between the hierarchical levels, but all contain similar elements. 


Major, sub-major, minor and unit group definitions 


The elements of major, sub-major, minor and unit group definitions are as follows: 


e Main heading - consists of the level in the ANZSCO hierarchy (e.g. minor group), the code, and the title of 
the group in that order. 

e Lead statement - describes the main activities undertaken in the group and, indirectly, the group's 
boundaries. 

e Inclusion and exclusion statements - are included only where necessary to avoid potential for confusion 
and to clarify the scope of the group. 

e Task list - a representative list of the principal or indicative tasks undertaken in the group. Because of the 
disparate nature of the occupations contained in ‘miscellaneous’ and ‘other’ groups, no task lists are 
provided for these groups. 

e Skill level statement - specifies the requirements for competent performance of occupations in the group, 
expressed in terms of the amount of formal education and training, previous experience and on-the-job 
training. Any special requirements, such as registration or licensing, are indicated in this statement. 

e List of lower categories - lists the categories (code and title) in the hierarchical level immediately below 
the group being defined. 


Occupation definitions 


The elements of occupation definitions are as follows: 


e Code - the numerical representation of the occupation. 

e Principal title - the title which best describes the particular occupation. It is generally the most commonly 
used title, although there are exceptions in cases where the most commonly used title is too broad or too 
narrow in meaning for the purposes of the ANZSCO occupation, or where occupations of different content 
are usually known by the same title. 

e Alternative title - any commonly used alternative title (or titles) for the occupation. These alternative titles 
have the same meaning as the principal title but may be less commonly used. 

e Lead statement - describes the nature of the occupation, summarising the main activities undertaken and, 
indirectly, the occupation's boundaries. Any special requirements, such as registration or licensing, are 
indicated in this statement. 

e Skill level - the number equating to the ANZSCO skill level of the occupation. 

e Specialisation titles - any commonly used titles which refer to a subset of jobs belonging to the occupation 
designated in the principal title. These jobs involve the performance of specialised tasks rather than the 
broader range of tasks usually performed in the occupation.
