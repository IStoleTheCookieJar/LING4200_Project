ABSTRACT 

The  technology  of  road  construction  is  subjected  to  changes  to  cope  up  with  changing  vehicular  pattern, 
construction  materials  and  sub-grade  conditions.  Rice  Husk  is  a waste  material  produced  in  rice  industry.  Rice  Husk  can  be 
used  in  various  geotechnical  constructions  like  embankments,  soil  stabilization,  and  sub  grades  etc.  Soil  stabilization  has 
become  a major  issue  in  construction  engineering  and  the  researches  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  using  industrial  wastes 
are  rapidly  increasing.  The  present  experimental  work  briefly  describes  the  suitability  of  the  locally  available  Rice  Husk 
Ash  (RHA)  to  be  used  in  the  local  construction  industry  in  a way  to  minimize  the  amount  of  waste  to  be  disposed  to  the 
environment  causing  environmental  pollution.  The  common  soil  stabilization  techniques  are  becoming  costly  day  by  day 
due  to  the  rise  of  cost  of  the  stabilizing  agents  like,  cement,  lime,  etc.  The  cost  of  stabilization  may  be  minimized  by 
replacing  a good  proportion  of  stabilizing  agent  using  RHA.

INTRODUCTION 

The  design  of  the  pavement  layers  laid  over  the  subgrade  soil  starts  off  with  the  determination  of  subgrade 
strength  and  the  traffic  volume  which  is  to  be  carried.  The  design  of  pavement  is  very  much  dependent  on  the  subgrade 
strength  of  soil.  Design  criteria  mainly  needs  thickness  of  layers.  Weaker  subgrade  needs  thicker  layers  whereas  stronger 
subgrade  needs  thinner  pavement  layers.  The  Indian  Road  Congress  (IRC)  provides  the  exact  procedures  for  the  pavement 
layers  design  which  is  based  upon  the  subgrade  strength.  The  strength  of  a subgrade  soil  is  normally  expressed  in  terms  of 
the  California  Bearing  Ratio  (CBR).  According  to  their  study  the  poor  subgrade  soil  having  soaked  CBR  value  less  than 
2%  is  to  be  replaced  by  good  quality  subgrade  materials  or  to  be  replaced  by  good  quality  subgrade  material  or  to  be 
stabilized  by  any  of  the  means[l].  In  his  experimental  work  he  used  RBI  Grade  81  as  an  additive  to  improve  the  properties 
of  subgrade  soil,  since  RBI  Grade  8 1 is  a costlier  additive  which  will  increase  the  construction  cost  of  the  road  he  also  used 
locally  available  moorum  which  may  reduce  the  construction  cost  upto  certain  extent[7]. 

MATERIALS  AND  PROPERTIES 

Black  Cotton  Soil 

The  soil  sample  is  collected  from  Navegao,  District  Gadchiroli  in  Maharashtra  state,  India.  Soil  Sample  is 
collected  1 meter  below  the  original  depth  then  collected  into  bag  and  send  into  the  laboratory  for  examination.

Rice  Husk  Ash 

For  the  present  work,  the  RHA  was  obtained  from  the  open  clay  brick  kill  at  Pardi,  District  Gadchiroli, 
Maharashtra. 

Moorum 

The  weathered  rock  fragments  which  are  gravelly  and  non-plastic  in  nature  are  locally  called  as  Moorum.  The 
granular  moorum  is  collected  from  Bhagwanpur,  District  Gadchiroli,  Maharashtra. 

METHODOLOGY 

The  technique  of  stabilizing  the  soil  with  locally  available  moorum  is  being  carried  since  long  time.  Mixing  Rice 
Husk  Ash,  Moorum  and  pulverized  black  cotton  soil  with  the  optimum  moisture  content  and  compacting  the  mix  to  attain 
required  density.  The  material  obtained  by  mixing  soil,  Rice  Husk  Ash  and  Moorum  is  known  as  stabilized  soil.  Many 
researchers  have  worked  extensively  on  the  utilization  of  Agricultural  waste  product  RHA  in  road  construction  techniques 
and  found  that  10%  RHA  mixed  with  the  natural  soil  gives  optimum  result.  Hence  for  the  present  study,  fixed  10%  RHA 
was  added  to  the  natural  soil  sample.  Similarly  increasing  proportion  of  moorum  as  stabilizer  also  improves  the  properties 
of  soil.

CONCLUSIONS 

Based  on  the  investigation,  following  conclusions  are  drawn: 

• Addition  of  stabilizer  (RHA  and  Moorum)  in  the  BC  soil  improves  the  Engineering  properties  of  the 
soil. 

• Addition  of  RHA  lowers  down  the  Maximum  Dry  Density  of  B.C.  Soil  owing  to  lesser  specific 
gravity. 

• Addition  of  RHA  improves  the  CBR  value  of  Natural  B.C.  Soil.
