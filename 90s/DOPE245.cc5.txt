[000:00:03;903] I THOUGHT, "WELL,
[000:00:03;903] IF WHAT I'M EXPERIENCING
[000:00:07;239] "IS THE POSSIBILITY
[000:00:07;239] OF WHERE THIS PERSON
[000:00:07;239] COULD BE,
[000:00:10;743] MAYBE THE WHITE I SEE
[000:00:10;743] IS HER UNIFORM,"
[000:00:14;246] KNOWING THAT
[000:00:14;246] SHE WAS A NURSE.
[000:00:17;383] DETECTIVE RYAN?
[000:00:21;687] FOR ETTA, THE VISION
[000:00:21;687] WAS SO POWERFUL
[000:00:24;690] AND SO PROFOUND,
[000:00:26;191] SHE FELT COMPELLED
[000:00:26;191] TO TELL THE POLICE
[000:00:28;694] EVEN AT THE RISK
[000:00:28;694] OF BEING RIDICULED.
[000:00:31;196] EXCUSE ME.
[000:00:31;196] DETECTIVE RYAN?
[000:00:32;698] ETTA SMITH?
[000:00:34;033] THE DESK SERGEANT
[000:00:34;033] SAID YOU HAD
[000:00:34;033] SOME INFORMATION
[000:00:36;869] ON MELANIE URIBE.
[000:00:38;370] I COULDN'T
[000:00:38;370] JUST LET IT GO,
[000:00:40;873] BECAUSE
[000:00:40;873] I KEPT WONDERING
[000:00:43;910] IF THIS PERSON
[000:00:43;910] NEEDED HELP.
[000:00:47;212] AND, IF THEIR LIFE
[000:00:47;212] DEPENDED ON THAT HELP,
[000:00:50;883] IT WOULD BE
[000:00:50;883] VERY WRONG OF ME
[000:00:53;886] NOT TO DO SOMETHING.
[000:00:55;387] THIS IS HARD
[000:00:55;387] TO EXPLAIN,
[000:00:57;389] BUT I THINK
[000:00:57;389] I'VE SEEN HER.
[000:00:59;892] YOU'VE SEEN HER?
[000:01:01;727] I GAVE HER A LOT
[000:01:01;727] OF CREDIBILITY
[000:01:04;730] BASED ON THE FACT
[000:01:04;730] THAT SHE CAME IN
[000:01:04;730] ON HER OWN.
[000:01:10;202] SHE INDICATED...
[000:01:12;737] HER CONSCIENCE
[000:01:12;737] WAS BOTHERING HER,
[000:01:14;739] WHICH TRIGGERED
[000:01:14;739] A RESPONSE IN ME
[000:01:16;741] THAT POSSIBLY
[000:01:16;741] HER CONSCIENCE
[000:01:16;741] WAS BOTHERING HER
[000:01:19;177] 'CAUSE MAYBE SHE
[000:01:19;177] KNOWS MORE THAN
[000:01:19;177] SHE'S TELLING US.
[000:01:22;180] BUT, THEN AGAIN,
[000:01:23;682] MAYBE SHE IS,
[000:01:23;682] IN FACT,
[000:01:25;684] SINCERE AND REAL,
[000:01:27;185] SO LET'S TREAT HER
[000:01:27;185] IN THAT LIGHT
[000:01:30;188] TILL WE FIND OUT
[000:01:30;188] OTHERWISE.
[000:01:33;692] BASED ON
[000:01:33;692] HER PSYCHIC VISION,
[000:01:36;127] ETTA PINPOINTED THE AREA
[000:01:36;127] IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY
[000:01:39;130] WHERE SHE THOUGHT
[000:01:40;632] THE MISSING NURSE
[000:01:40;632] MIGHT BE FOUND.
[000:01:42;701] "LOPEZ CANYON."
[000:01:44;035] THAT'S IT.
[000:01:48;206] DESPITE DETECTIVE RYAN'S
[000:01:48;206] WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN,
[000:01:51;209] ETTA WORRIED
[000:01:51;209] THAT THE POLICE
[000:01:53;211] WOULD NOT
[000:01:53;211] DO ANYTHING IMMEDIATELY,
[000:01:55;046] SO SHE DECIDED
[000:01:55;046] TO INVESTIGATE ON HER OWN.
[000:01:57;548] ACCOMPANIED
[000:01:57;548] BY HER DAUGHTER TINA,
[000:01:59;550] ETTA DROVE
[000:01:59;550] TO LOPEZ CANYON.
[000:02:05;223] I JUST DON'T
[000:02:05;223] UNDERSTAND THIS.
[000:02:07;225] I AM SO CERTAIN.
[000:02:09;193] WHEN ETTA STEPPED
[000:02:09;193] OUT OF HER CAR
[000:02:11;696] AT THE TOP
[000:02:11;696] OF THE CANYON,
[000:02:14;198] THE FEELING OF DREAD
[000:02:14;198] RETURNED.
[000:02:16;200] ETTA WAS CERTAIN MELANIE
[000:02:16;200] HAD NOT ONLY BEEN THERE,
[000:02:19;137] BUT THAT SOMETHING HORRIBLE
[000:02:19;137] HAD HAPPENED TO HER.
[000:02:22;206] OH, NO. SHE'S HERE.
[000:02:23;807] NO, SHE
[000:02:23;807] IS DEFINITELY HERE.
[000:02:25;809] LET'S GO DOWN
[000:02:25;809] AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.
[000:02:28;979] I FELT TRAUMA
[000:02:30;481] AND I FELT SCARED
[000:02:32;650] AND I FELT...
[000:02:34;152] IT WAS LIKE AN ENERGY
[000:02:36;154] THAT WAS LIKE TINGLING
[000:02:36;154] INSIDE OF ME.
[000:02:39;323] IT WAS SORT OF
[000:02:39;323] LIKE YOU FEEL
[000:02:42;326] WHEN YOU GET
[000:02:42;326] AN ADRENALINE RUSH.
[000:02:44;862] LET'S LOOK FOR
[000:02:44;862] SOMETHING WHITE.
[000:02:47;165] ON THE WAY
[000:02:47;165] BACK DOWN THE CANYON,
[000:02:50;168] ETTA AND TINA NOTICED
[000:02:50;168] A SET OF FRESH TIRE TRACKS.
[000:02:53;171] WAIT A MINUTE.
[000:02:54;672] WHAT IS IT?
[000:02:56;174] I STOPPED
[000:02:57;308] AND, FOR REASONS
[000:02:57;308] UNKNOWN TO ME,
[000:02:59;810] I WANTED TO LOOK
[000:02:59;810] AT THESE TIRE MARKS
[000:03:02;180] AND I WANTED TO PUT
[000:03:02;180] MY HANDS IN THEM.
[000:03:08;686] I'M STARTING
[000:03:08;686] TO FEEL MORE TRAUMA
[000:03:10;688] AND IT'S
[000:03:10;688] STARTING TO BUILD
[000:03:12;690] AND I'M GETTING
[000:03:12;690] MORE NERVOUS.
[000:03:15;526] OH, MY GOD.
[000:03:17;961] WHAT'S GOING ON?
[000:03:20;631] SHE WAS HERE.
[000:03:23;801] SHE WAS RIGHT HERE.
[000:03:25;803] AND WHEN IT GOT
[000:03:25;803] TO THAT POINT,
[000:03:28;806] IT WAS LIKE
[000:03:28;806] I WAS ON OVERLOAD.
[000:03:32;142] SHE WAS
[000:03:32;142] SO FRIGHTENED.
[000:03:35;779] WHEN WE GOT BACK
[000:03:35;779] IN THE VAN,
[000:03:38;481] THE ONLY THING
[000:03:38;481] I COULD THINK ABOUT
[000:03:40;983] IS "I WANT
[000:03:40;983] TO LEAVE HERE.
[000:03:42;985] I DON'T WANT
[000:03:42;985] TO BE HERE."
[000:03:47;457] FURTHER DOWN THE CANYON,
[000:03:47;457] ETTA STOPPED AGAIN
[000:03:50;460] WHEN TINA NOTICED
[000:03:50;460] SOMETHING UNUSUAL
[000:03:50;460] IN THE BRUSH.
[000:03:53;597] IT'S RIGHT UP THERE,
[000:03:53;597] MOM.
[000:03:55;898] [ETTA]
[000:03:55;898] I WALKED WITHIN 6 FEET
[000:03:55;898] OF THIS OBJECT.
[000:04:00;770] I COULD NOT TELL
[000:04:00;770] WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT.
[000:04:04;574] IT A MINUTE.
[000:04:07;244] THE ONLY THING
[000:04:07;244] I COULD TRULY
[000:04:07;244] DISTINGUISH
[000:04:09;812] AND KNOW
[000:04:09;812] WHAT THIS WAS
[000:04:11;848] WAS SHE HAD ON
[000:04:11;848] WHITE NURSE'S SHOES.
[000:04:16;319] 
[000:04:16;319] GO, GO, GO!
[000:04:20;557] ETTA IMMEDIATELY
[000:04:20;557] CONTACTED THE POLICE.
[000:04:25;094] AN AUTOPSY
[000:04:25;094] LATER DETERMINED
[000:04:26;663] THAT THE BODY
[000:04:26;663] WAS INDEED MELANIE URIBE.
[000:04:29;666] SHE HAD BEEN ROBBED,
[000:04:29;666] RAPED, AND BEATEN TO DEATH.
[000:04:33;336] ETTA SMITH'S
[000:04:33;336] CLAIRVOYANT VISION
[000:04:33;336] HAD BEEN CONFIRMED.
[000:04:38;340] HAVE A SEAT.
[000:04:38;340] WE WANT TO ASK
[000:04:38;340] A FEW QUESTIONS.
[000:04:41;677] THAT EVENING,
[000:04:41;677] ETTA WAS SUMMONED
[000:04:43;178] TO THE POLICE STATION.
[000:04:44;680] AT 7 P.M.,
[000:04:44;680] SHE WAS QUESTIONED
[000:04:46;682] BY TWO DETECTIVES
[000:04:46;682] SHE'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
[000:04:49;151] DO YOU MIND
[000:04:49;151] IF I CALL YOU ETTA?
[000:04:51;820] NO.
[000:04:52;988] DID YOU KNOW
[000:04:52;988] THE VICTIM
[000:04:52;988] MELANIE URIBE?
[000:04:55;524] NO, I NEVER MET HER.
[000:04:57;025] I HEARD ABOUT HER
[000:04:57;025] ON THE NEWS.
[000:04:59;695] HAD YOU EVER BEEN
[000:04:59;695] UP TO LOPEZ CANYON?
[000:05:02;864] [ETTA]
[000:05:02;864] THEY WANTED ME
[000:05:02;864] TO EXPLAIN TO THEM
[000:05:06;702] HOW THE WHOLE THING
[000:05:06;702] HAD UNFOLDED.
[000:05:09;405] WHO SPOTTED
[000:05:09;405] THE BODY?
[000:05:10;906] AND THAT SEEMED
[000:05:10;906] VERY NORMAL TO ME.
[000:05:13;409] MY DAUGHTER.
[000:05:14;777] AFTER I FELT I HAD FINISHED
[000:05:14;777] TELLING THEM EVERYTHING
[000:05:17;879] AND FILLED IN THE BLANKS,
[000:05:19;782] IT'S LIKE, "LET'S START
[000:05:19;782] AT THE BEGINNING.
[000:05:22;751] TELL US THIS AGAIN."
[000:05:24;252] LET'S GO THROUGH
[000:05:24;252] THE PSYCHIC THING
[000:05:24;252] ONE MORE TIME.
[000:05:28;490] SO WE GO
[000:05:28;490] THROUGH THE STORY AGAIN...
[000:05:31;827] AND AGAIN...
[000:05:34;196] AND AGAIN.
[000:05:35;631] I SAW IT
[000:05:35;631] IN MY HEAD.
[000:05:38;133] YOU REALLY EXPECT US
[000:05:38;133] TO BELIEVE THIS?
[000:05:41;069] THIS WENT ON FOR HOURS...
[000:05:43;872] UNTIL ABOUT 10:00
[000:05:43;872] THAT EVENING...
[000:05:46;875] MRS. SMITH...
[000:05:48;109] WHEN IT BECOMES
[000:05:48;109] VERY OBVIOUS TO ME
[000:05:51;613] THAT NOW I'M A SUSPECT.
[000:05:53;614] YOU'RE A LIAR.
[000:05:58;052] DO YOU THINK
[000:05:58;052] I HAD SOMETHING TO DO
[000:05:58;052] WITH THIS MURDER?
[000:06:02;557] MRS. SMITH,
[000:06:02;557] YOU KNOW TOO MUCH.
[000:06:04;559] THERE'S TOO MUCH
[000:06:04;559] OF A COINCIDENCE.
[000:06:06;561] I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
[000:06:08;796] WHAT HAPPENED
[000:06:08;796] TO THAT WOMAN.
[000:06:11;699] THE INVESTIGATING
[000:06:11;699] OFFICERS,
[000:06:13;200] HAVING
[000:06:13;200] NO OTHER LEADS
[000:06:13;200] OR CLUES,
[000:06:15;703] DIDN'T HAVE
[000:06:15;703] ANY OTHER CHOICE
[000:06:15;703] AT THAT TIME
[000:06:18;205] BUT TO PRESUME
[000:06:18;205] SHE WAS
[000:06:18;205] AN ACCESSORY,
[000:06:20;641] EITHER BEFORE OR
[000:06:20;641] AFTER THE COMMISSION
[000:06:20;641] OF THE CRIME.
[000:06:23;177] IS TODAY MONDAY?
[000:06:25;913] YES.
[000:06:27;114] ETTA VOLUNTEERED
[000:06:27;114] TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH EXAM.
[000:06:29;617] AT MIDNIGHT,
[000:06:31;151] FIVE HOURS AFTER
[000:06:31;151] SHE WAS FIRST BROUGHT IN
[000:06:31;151] FOR QUESTIONING,
[000:06:34;422] ETTA UNDERWENT THE FIRST
[000:06:34;422] OF TWO TESTS.
[000:06:36;891] I CAN'T BELIEVE
[000:06:36;891] SHE'S TELLING
[000:06:36;891] THE TRUTH.
[000:06:39;293] ETTA PASSED BOTH EXAMS.
[000:06:40;795] HOWEVER, THE DETECTIVES
[000:06:40;795] WITHHELD THAT INFORMATION.
[000:06:43;297] THEY WERE STILL CONVINCED
[000:06:44;799] THAT ONLY SOMEONE INVOLVED
[000:06:44;799] IN THE CRIME
[000:06:47;301] COULD KNOW THE DETAILS
[000:06:47;301] ETTA HAD REVEALED.
[000:06:51;205] YOU FAILED
[000:06:51;205] THE POLYGRAPH TEST.
[000:06:54;308] NO, I...
[000:06:55;643] [ETTA]
[000:06:55;643] I WASN'T SURE IF IT
[000:06:55;643] WAS A BLUFF OR WHAT.
[000:06:59;980] I WAS SO TIRED,
[000:06:59;980] I DIDN'T CARE
[000:06:59;980] ANYMORE.
[000:07:02;483] I WANTED TO GET AWAY
[000:07:02;483] FROM THEM.
[000:07:04;985] I WAS EITHER GOING
[000:07:04;985] TO GO HOME
[000:07:04;985] OR TO JAIL.
[000:07:08;755] I DID GET ANGRY.
[000:07:10;257] YOU CAN'T
[000:07:10;257] LEAVE ME HERE.
[000:07:12;592] AT 5 A.M., ETTA SMITH
[000:07:12;592] WAS FORMALLY BOOKED
[000:07:15;595] ON A CHARGE OF MURDER.
[000:07:17;398] A JAILER WILL LET YOU KNOW
[000:07:17;398] HOW TO REACH ME.
[000:07:20;301] BUT I'M TELLING
[000:07:20;301] THE TRUTH!
[000:07:28;542] FOR FOUR DAYS,
[000:07:28;542] ETTA LANGUISHED IN JAIL,
[000:07:31;545] UNAWARE OF CERTAIN
[000:07:31;545] DRAMATIC EVENTS
[000:07:33;547] TAKING PLACE
[000:07:33;547] ON THE OUTSIDE.
[000:07:36;083] ETTA.
[000:07:40;354] SEEMS LIKE
[000:07:40;354] WE MADE A MISTAKE.
[000:07:42;856] WE JUST ARRESTED
[000:07:42;856] TWO YOUNG MEN
[000:07:45;359] WHO CONFESSED
[000:07:45;359] TO THE MURDER
[000:07:45;359] OF MELANIE URIBE.
[000:07:48;929] IN THE END, ETTA SMITH
[000:07:48;929] WAS COMPLETELY ABSOLVED.
[000:07:51;932] 15 YEARS LATER,
[000:07:51;932] THE TWO CONFESSED KILLERS
[000:07:51;932] ARE STILL IN PRISON.
[000:08:00;707] [DETECTIVE RYAN]
[000:08:00;707] IN ETTA'S CASE,
[000:08:02;309] I WAS QUITE AMAZED.
[000:08:03;810] A LOT OF OTHERS
[000:08:03;810] WERE, TOO,
[000:08:05;812] BUT THEY
[000:08:05;812] WERE RELUCTANT
[000:08:05;812] TO ADMIT IT.
[000:08:08;315] HAD IT NOT BEEN
[000:08:08;315] FOR ETTA SMITH,
[000:08:10;817] I DON'T THINK
[000:08:10;817] THIS CASE WOULD
[000:08:10;817] HAVE BEEN SOLVED
[000:08:13;319] AS RAPIDLY
[000:08:13;319] AS IT WAS,
[000:08:14;821] OR POSSIBLY
[000:08:14;821] NOT AT ALL.
[000:08:16;322] I SOMETIMES WONDER
[000:08:16;322] WHAT IT WAS THAT TRANSPIRED,
[000:08:24;865] UH...FROM
[000:08:24;865] THIS INNOCENT PERSON
[000:08:28;468] WHO WAS MURDERED,
[000:08:29;970] UH, HOW HER DEATH
[000:08:29;970] SOMEHOW REACHED OUT
[000:08:29;970] AND TOUCHED ME.
[000:08:36;676] I THINK IT'S ONE
[000:08:36;676] OF THE MYSTERIES IN LIFE,
[000:08:40;179] THAT MANY THINGS HAPPEN
[000:08:40;179] TO US THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE
[000:08:43;683] THAT ARE UNEXPLAINABLE.
[000:08:48;421] SINCE
[000:08:48;421] HER REMARKABLE PSYCHIC
[000:08:48;421] EXPERIENCE IN 1980,
[000:08:51;424] ETTA SMITH HAS HONED
[000:08:51;424] HER APPARENT POWERS.
[000:08:54;427] SHE HAS ASSISTED POLICE
[000:08:54;427] AND CRIME VICTIMS
[000:08:54;427] IN SEVERAL CASES,
[000:08:58;431] ALWAYS PROVIDING
[000:08:58;431] HER SERVICES
[000:08:58;431] FREE OF CHARGE.
[000:09:01;434] IN A MOMENT, YOU'LL MEET
[000:09:01;434] A DIFFERENT KIND OF PSYCHIC,
[000:09:05;438] A MAN WHO CLAIMS
[000:09:05;438] HIS PARANORMAL ABILITIES
[000:09:05;438] ENABLE HIM

[000:13:25;094] ROUGH LANGUAGE? HOWARD STERN

[000:13:43;913] SO FAR KSFO'S RATINGS HAVE
[000:13:44;746] DOUBLED. DOES THAT MEAN A
[000:13:46;448] POLITICAL SHIFT OF NATIONAL

[000:13:48;918] BAY AREA IS MOVING RIGHT?

[000:14:31;793] SUBJECT IS SPREADING AIDS.

[000:14:47;776] HAPPEN? SURE, IT COULD HAPPEN.
[000:14:48;577] IS IT LIKELY? ABSOLUTELY NOT.

[000:15:03;658] SOPHISTICATED HEAR IT, THEY CAN
[000:15:04;459] INTERNALIZE IT. ACT ON IT."

[000:15:16;037] KSFO MANAGEMENT WOULD NOT
[000:15:17;706] PERMIT INTERVIEWS WITH HIM.
[000:15:19;474] LAST MONTH, THOUGH, EMERSON DID
[000:15:20;275] TALK WITH CBS NEWS ABOUT HIS

[000:15:31;019] WHICH RAISES WHAT IS PROBABLY
[000:15:32;721] THE KEY QUESTION: IS HOT TALK

[000:25:06;252] AND LEFT A RELUCTANT DEFENSE
[000:25:07;020] WITNESS IN TEARS.. PLEADING
[000:25:08;421] SIMPLY TO BE LEFT ALONE.
[000:25:19;132] ROSA LOPEZ IS A KEY,
[000:25:36;817] BUT EXTREMELY RELUCTANT DEFENSE

[000:25:58;071] TESTIMONY TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY.
[000:25:59;639] THAT PROMPTED AN OBJECTION

[000:26:12;152] THE JUDGE REJECTED A
[000:26:26;832] COMPROMISE OFFERED BY DEFENSE

[000:26:50;457] CONTRADICTIONS IN LOPEZ'S
[000:26:51;157] TESTIMONY.
[000:26:52;758] AT ONE POINT TODAY... UNDER
[000:26:53;560] INTENSE CROSS EXAMINATION..
[000:26:56;195] PROSECUTOR CHRISTOPHER DARDEN
[000:26:57;196] GOT LOPEZ TO ADMIT ON THE
[000:26:58;230] STAND..SHE WAS LYING.
[000:27:00;532] RANDY SHANDOBIL REPORTS ON
[000:27:01;333] WHAT HAPPENED IN COURT EARLIER
[000:27:02;134] TODAY.
[000:27:05;504] ONE MINUTE ROSA LOPEZ SEEMED
[000:27:06;305] LIKE A TERRIFIED LITTLE GIRL,
[000:27:07;539] SOMEONE YOU WANTED TO REACH OUT
[000:27:09;875] AND HELP. THE NEXT MINUTE SHE
[000:27:10;643] SEEMED LIKE A LIAR.
[000:27:13;646] Why were you living in another
[000:27:14;714] state over the course of the
[000:27:16;248] last several days?
[000:27:18;183] because the reporters won't
[000:27:19;085] leave me alone. i'tired of
[000:27:20;686] looking at them. they have been
[000:27:21;854] harassing me.
[000:27:28;027] ROSA LOPEZ IS THE ONE AND ONLY
[000:27:29;261] PERSON SO FAR TO STEP UP AND
[000:27:31;897] OFFER O.J. SIMPSON AN ALIBI.
[000:27:33;298] BUT WOULD SHE REMAIN IN LOS
[000:27:34;734] ANGELES TO TESTIFY ABOUT IT? OR
[000:27:36;035] WOULD SHE VANISH OUT OF FEAR?
[000:27:42;775] FOR YEARS, LOPEZ WORKED AS A
[000:27:44;209] LIVE-IN HOUSEKEEPER AT THE
[000:27:45;811] HOUSE RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO O.J.
[000:27:48;881] SIMPSON'S. SHE SAYS SHE SAW
[000:27:50;516] SIMPSON'S FORD BRONCO PARKED AT
[000:27:51;383] HIS ROCKINGHAM GATE, AT TEN
[000:27:53;285] FIFTEEN ON THE NIGHT OF THE
[000:27:54;453] KILLINGS. THAT'S THE TIME
[000:27:55;955] PROSECUTORS SAY SIMPSON WAS TWO
[000:27:58;858] MILES AWAY, KILLING NICOLE
[000:28:00;192] BROWN SIMPSON AND RONALD
[000:28:00;892] GOLDMAN.
[000:28:03;294] BUT SINCE LOPEZ'S TESTIMONY IS
[000:28:06;397] SO IMPORTANT, THE MEDIA HAS
[000:28:08;033] BEEN ALL OVER HER... AND SHE
[000:28:09;567] SAYS SHE CAN'T STAND IT.
[000:28:14;939] Tell the court how your life
[000:28:16;541] has changed since that time.
[000:28:19;377] because i can't go out, not
[000:28:20;745] even to go to the laundry or
[000:28:22;080] anywhere, because wherever i go
[000:28:24;749] people are pointing at me
[000:28:25;449] did this cause some problems
[000:28:26;217] with your employer?
[000:28:26;818] yes
[000:28:27;152] has it caused any problems with
[000:28:27;952] your particular family?
[000:28:28;619] with everybody
[000:28:31;355] alright, specifically with
[000:28:33;591] regard to your daughter. can
[000:28:37;862] you indicate to the court what,
[000:28:39;430] if any problems you've suffered
[000:28:42;366] by virtue of your being a
[000:28:43;068] witness in this case
[000:28:45;269] i had to leave her house.
[000:28:47;972] and why did you have to leave
[000:28:48;740] her house?
[000:28:50;408] because she told me that if i
[000:28:51;976] came to testify that she didn't
[000:28:53;377] want me in her home.
[000:28:55;013] and that made you sad?
[000:28:56;414] very much
[000:28:58;282] and does your daughter have
[000:29:01;519] some children also who areyour
[000:29:02;320] grandchildren?
[000:29:04;756] i have two granddaughters who i
[000:29:05;556] adore
[000:29:06;124] thankyou
[000:29:14;965] BUT JUST MINUTES BEFORE
[000:29:18;168] TESTIFYING ABOUT HOW THE MEDIA
[000:29:19;569] HAS RUINED HER LIFE, ROSA LOPEZ
[000:29:22;072] DID SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO
[000:29:23;673] CONTRADICT THAT. SHE GRABBED
[000:29:24;441] THIS REPORTER.
[000:29:29;479] The lady near the courtroom
[000:29:30;214] doors
[000:29:32;049] is that the woman that you
[000:29:32;783] spoke to this morning and said
[000:29:33;583] "i love you on tv?"?
[000:29:34;184] yes, because i watch her on tv
[000:29:34;952] ok. and she was walking past
[000:29:35;719] you at the time?
[000:29:36;253] yes
[000:29:36;653] and you pulled on her skirt and
[000:29:37;454] stopped her?
[000:29:39;389] no. i didn't touch that lady. i
[000:29:40;724] only told her, "you look very
[000:29:42;126] pretty on tv."
[000:29:49;699] as I was walking out of the
[000:29:51;201] courtroom in the morning rosa
[000:29:51;969] lopez had not yet taken the
[000:29:52;702] stand was seated against the
[000:29:53;837] back wall and as i was walking
[000:29:54;638] out she reached out and either
[000:29:55;438] pulled at my skirt or brushed
[000:29:56;206] it back and forth to get my
[000:29:56;940] attention and i did look down
[000:29:57;707] and saw that it was rosa lopez.
[000:29:58;742] and at that point in time she
[000:29:59;843] was smiling, her face was
[000:30:01;078] beaming is the best way that i
[000:30:02;112] can describe it and she was
[000:30:02;880] saying, "i love you on tv, and
[000:30:03;680] i know you from tv, you're so
[000:30:04;447] pretty, i like to watch you on
[000:30:05;249] tv." and i looked startled i
[000:30:06;016] believe because her attorney
[000:30:06;784] carl jones who was sitting next
[000:30:07;584] to her looked up at me and
[000:30:08;318] said, "she just knows you from
[000:30:09;119] tv" as if to explain why this
[000:30:09;987] was occuring. and i kept moving
[000:30:10;788] as you know when you're in the
[000:30:11;588] court room you file out in
[000:30:12;322] single file and you don't stop
[000:30:13;123] or the deputies will have a
[000:30:13;857] problem with you.
[000:30:14;424] LOPEZ EXPLAINED THE APPARENT
[000:30:15;192] CONTRADICTION BY SAYING SHE
[000:30:15;926] ONLY HATES REPORTERS WHO SHOVE
[000:30:16;726] CAMERAS IN HER FACE. BUT THEN
[000:30:17;494] SHE CONTRADICTED HERSELF AGAIN
[000:30:18;295] ABOUT PLANNING TO GO TO EL
[000:30:19;029] SALVADOR.
[000:30:19;462] Do you have a home in el
[000:30:20;163] salvador?
[000:30:20;596] yes
[000:30:20;930] do you have any present plans
[000:30:21;697] to return to el savaldor? I
[000:30:22;598] would like to go tomorrow
[000:30:23;299] back to el salvador?
[000:30:23;900] yes
[000:30:26;568] LOPEZ TOLD THE COURT SHE MADE A
[000:30:27;670] RESERVATION ON TACA AIRLINES.
[000:30:29;371] SHE TOLD THE COURT THE PRICE.
[000:30:30;139] BUT.
[000:30:32;875] Ms Lopez we just called th
[000:30:33;776] airline. they don't show a
[000:30:34;977] reservation for you. can you
[000:30:36;145] explain to the court why it is
[000:30:38;414] that you just told us you have
[000:30:39;415] a reservation? because i am
[000:30:40;449] going to reserve it, sir as
[000:30:42;584] soon as i leave here i will buy
[000:30:43;385] my ticket and i will leave. if
[000:30:44;187] you want to the cameras can
[000:30:44;921] follow me.
[000:30:47;356] so, you have not made a
[000:30:48;024] reservation?
[000:30:55;564] but i will make it as soon as i
[000:30:56;365] leave here.
[000:31:03;539] ok. you have not made a
[000:31:04;207] reser.....
[000:31:06;976] i can't call up one in the
[000:31:10;746] morning because the airlines
[000:31:12;581] are closed at that time. i have
[000:31:14;116] to wait
[000:31:17;887] you just told us that you
[000:31:19;722] already made a reservation
[000:31:23;359] but i will make the reservation
[000:31:25;094] sir and i will leave. that is
[000:31:26;162] for sure, today.
[000:31:27;396] so, when you told us that you
[000:31:28;164] already made a reservation, you
[000:31:28;965] were lying.
[000:31:29;431] no. because i will make it,
[000:31:30;165] sir.
[000:31:31;333] you told us you made a
[000:31:32;735] reservation prior to coming to
[000:31:33;935] court this morning, miss lopez.
[000:31:35;738] your honor can you instruct the
[000:31:36;538] witness to just answer the
[000:31:37;272] question.
[000:31:37;706] wait, wait, wait.
[000:31:38;273] may i reask the question?
[000:31:38;974] alright. restate your question
[000:31:40;442] miss lopez, didn't you tell us
[000:31:41;243] that you made the reservation
[000:31:42;210] prior to your coming to court
[000:31:42;978] today? yes or no
[000:31:43;512] no
[000:31:43;879] you didn't just tell us that
[000:31:44;646] yes, i told you
[000:31:45;914] but you knew, when you told us
[000:31:46;715] that that you had not made a
[000:31:47;483] reservation. correct? yes or
[000:31:48;250] no? correct?
[000:31:48;717] correct
[000:31:49;117] you lied to us, didn't you? yes
[000:31:49;918] or no?
[000:31:50;285] because...
[000:31:50;719] you can explain
[000:31:51;253] because the agencies are
[000:31:51;953] closed. they open at ten in the
[000:31:52;755] morning and i was brought here
[000:31:53;555] very early, sir.
[000:31:54;089] you don't have any plans to
[000:31:54;823] leave los angeles at all do
[000:31:55;557] you?of course, sir. my bags are
[000:31:56;358] packed. everything is ready.
[000:31:57;092] WHY WOULD LOPEZ LIE.
[000:31:57;726] PROSECUTORS ACCUSED DEFENSE
[000:31:58;460] ATTORNEYS OF PUTTING HER UP TO
[000:31:59;261] IT... PERHAPS EVEN PAYING HER
[000:32:00;028] TO LIE, LIE ABOUT FLEEING THE
[000:32:00;796] COUNTRY SO THE JUDGE WOULD
[000:32:01;530] ORDER HER TESTIMONY
[000:32:02;130] VIDEOTAPED.... THAT WAY THE
[000:32:03;198] DEFENSE COULD TRY OUT HER
[000:32:04;132] TESTIMONY, SEE IF IT HOLDS UP
[000:32:04;933] BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO SHOW
[000:32:05;734] IT TO THE JURY.
[000:32:07;936] When you spoke to Mr cochrane
[000:32:12;307] in the cafeteria did he appear
[000:32:13;108] upset at all?
[000:32:14;109] no
[000:32:16;278] did he raise his voice?
[000:32:17;713] no
[000:32:22;250] did he tell you that you were
[000:32:23;752] messing up on the witness
[000:32:24;453] stand?
[000:32:26;688] i think he's entitled to ask
[000:32:28;356] that kind of question. may or
[000:32:29;691] may not be true.
[000:32:30;992] was mr. cochrane animated at
[000:32:31;760] all during the conversation
[000:32:32;494] that you had with him?
[000:32:33;128] no
[000:32:33;429] LOPEZ'S TRAVEL AGENT WAS CALLED
[000:32:34;229] IN AND SHE REVEALED YET ANOTHER
[000:32:35;063] CONTRADICTION. JUST ONE WEEK
[000:32:36;398] AGO LOPEZ RESERVED A ROUND TRIP
[000:32:38;766] TICKET TO EL SALVADOR FOR NEXT
[000:32:39;967] MONTH. FLIGHT RISK? AND WHAT
[000:32:42;537] ABOUT HER APPLICATION FOR
[000:32:43;905] UNEMPLOYMENT?.. SHE WOULD HAVE
[000:32:45;105] TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY TO
[000:32:45;807] COLLECT.
[000:32:50;277] wherever i go people look at me
[000:32:52;613] and point at me and say see
[000:32:56;216] that's the woman that's in mr.
[000:32:57;952] simpson's case. and i'm afraid
[000:33:07;829] you're afraid for your
[000:33:09;697] personal safety?
[000:33:10;598] yes
[000:33:13;901] when you went down to... was
[000:33:14;669] there a time you went down to
[000:33:15;436] the unemployment office?
[000:33:16;103] yes
[000:33:17;404] and spoke with an unemployment
[000:33:18;205] counselor?
[000:33:18;639] yes
[000:33:18;973] and did this unemployment
[000:33:19;674] counselor say something to you?
[000:33:20;475] a security
[000:33:20;908] alright. did this security
[000:33:21;642] person...did that person
[000:33:22;343] recognize you?
[000:33:22;844] yes
[000:33:23;177] what did that person say to
[000:33:23;911] you?
[000:33:24;244] it was a black guy. he said to
[000:33:25;045] me,"you're simpson's
[000:33:25;680] did that concern you also?
[000:33:26;380] yes, very much. i won't go back
[000:33:27;181] there.
[000:33:27;548] what about the safety of your
[000:33:28;315] family?
[000:33:28;716] i am very scared for my
[000:33:29;383] children, too
[000:33:30;651] LOPEZ SAID ONE NIGHT THIS WEEK
[000:33:31;586] SHE HAD TO SLEER IN HER CAR...
[000:33:33;721] HER DAUGHTER THREW HER OUT OF
[000:33:34;789] THE HOUSE... AFRAID SOMEONE
[000:33:35;990] MIGHT TRY TO KILL HER. SOMEONE
[000:33:38;125] FROM QUOTE... THE OTHER SIDE.
[000:33:41;496] Who are the people on the other
[000:33:42;296] side?
[000:33:42;663] i don't know
[000:33:43;130] are they black people?
[000:33:44;632] no. i don't know. she didn't
[000:33:45;399] specify
[000:33:46;166] no one has threathened you with
[000:33:46;968] any physical harm, correct?
[000:33:47;701] correct?
[000:33:48;969] but many of my friends tell me
[000:33:50;036] to be very careful because this
[000:33:51;938] case is very difficult and that
[000:33:52;806] i could even be killed.
[000:33:55;341] PROSECUTORS SCOFF AT THE NOTION
[000:33:56;142] LOPEZ WILL ESCAPE MEDIA HASSLE
[000:33:57;544] IN EL SALVADOR.... THEY SAY SHE
[000:33:58;612] IS EVEN BIGGER NEWS DOWN THERE.
[000:34:01;581] There are billboards down there
[000:34:03;316] saying if you see rosa lopez
[000:34:04;083] call this number.
[000:34:05;385] Johnnie Cochran--
[000:34:07;186] Here is a lady who's a
[000:34:08;121] housekeeper. who has no other
[000:34:09;088] means of support. whose family
[000:34:11;391] has been torn assunder by the
[000:34:12;425] fact that she witnessed
[000:34:13;693] something that will bear on mr.
[000:34:14;861] simpson's innocence. and that
[000:34:17;597] may not be fair to her, but she
[000:34:18;932] has acted it seems to me out of
[000:34:21;501] a sense of duty. she's had a
[000:34:22;702] lawyer, mr. jones who's advised
[000:34:24;103] her throughout and it seems to
[000:34:25;471] me that the court has to look
[000:34:27;440] at the things that has happened
[000:34:28;241] to this lady. she had a job for
[000:34:29;643] three years with the
[000:34:30;610] sallingers. she doesn't have
[000:34:31;511] that job anymore. this is not a
[000:34:34;748] wealthy lady your honor. you
[000:34:36;249] work for three years for a
[000:34:36;983] family who by and large was
[000:34:37;717] pretty happy with you. but i
[000:34:38;484] would suspect, and i think it's
[000:34:39;285] reasonable that when this case
[000:34:40;086] comes into your life, things
[000:34:40;854] happen and things change.
[000:34:41;555] Judge if you put yourself in
[000:34:42;321] her place. who'd want to come
[000:34:43;089] back and be subjected to all
[000:34:43;857] kind of questions when.. all
[000:34:44;624] you come in and say is look,
[000:34:45;391] i'm afraid for my safety. who
[000:34:46;159] among us can say she's not
[000:34:46;893] telling the truth? none of us
[000:34:47;661] can do that. she says i have
[000:34:48;428] nothing to do with this case,
[000:34:49;195] except i'm a witness. and i'm
[000:34:49;963] afraid for my safety. i want to
[000:34:50;764] go back to my homeland where i
[000:34:51;565] have a home. i don't have a
[000:34:52;298] home in los angeles. i don't
[000:34:53;066] want to reveal to you where i
[000:34:53;832] had to go the other day when i
[000:34:54;633] flew back here tonight. and i
[000:34:55;401] want to go back to that place.
[000:34:56;202] my bags are packed.
[000:34:56;802] LIKE PROSECUTORS, JUDGE ITO
[000:34:57;537] SAID HE TOO HAS TROUBLE
[000:34:58;204] BELIEVING LOPEZ... BUT HE SAID
[000:34:59;004] HE'S AFRAID THAT IF O.J.
[000:34:59;705] SIMPSON WERE TO BE CONVICTED
[000:35:00;473] THIS WOULD CERTAINLY BE AN
[000:35:01;207] ISSUE OF APPEAL. HE DECIDED TO
[000:35:02;007] PLAY IT SAFE, AND SECURE
[000:35:02;708] LOPEZ'S TESTIMONY ON VIDEOTAPE.
[000:35:03;509] IMMEDIATELY... TONIGHT.
[000:35:04;177] But at the last minute,
[000:35:04;843] prosecutors apparently changed
[000:35:05;644] their strategy... no need to
[000:35:06;412] videotape rosa lopez's
[000:35:07;080] testimony. It appears they
[000:35:07;813] agreed to do something
[000:35:08;481] extremely rare... allow their
[000:35:09;248] case to be interrupted so the
[000:35:10;015] defense can call rosa lopez
[000:35:10;749] now... but in front of the
[000:35:11;484] jury. And that's what the judge
[000:35:12;285] ordered, for Monday. it seems
[000:35:13;052] prosecutors feel lopez is such
[000:35:13;852] a liar... they want a chance to
[000:35:14;653] break her, live, with the jury
[000:35:15;455] watching. randy shandobil for
[000:35:16;222] the ten oclock news.
[000:36:34;833] all they have and she's so
[000:36:37;002] blatantly unbelievable then it
[000:36:37;803] must have been OJ.
[000:36:40;472] DURING ONE EXCHANGE TODAY,
[000:36:41;740] DARDEN GOT LOPEZ TO ACKNOWLEDGE
[000:36:49;114] SHE DIDN'T USUALLY WEAR A
[000:36:50;082] WATCH... ADD THAT TO HER
[000:36:50;883] INCONSITENCIES, AND ANALYSTS
[000:36:51;917] SAY LOPEZ COULD BE BIG TROUBLE
[000:36:53;118] FOR THE DEFENSE...
[000:36:57;389] Burris--if today is any
[000:36:58;891] indicator I think a jury would
[000:36:59;692] have some trouble with her
[000:37:00;425] particularly in the wearingof
[000:37:01;526] that watchs, if she doesn't
[000:37:02;260] always wear a watch or
[000:37:03;028] sometimes wears it, they how
[000:37:03;796] can they sy she knew she saw
[000:37:04;563] the Bronco on that particular
[000:37:05;330] day at that particular time.
[000:37:08;933] OUR ANALYSTS AGREE THAT
[000:37:10;935] TACTICALLY, THE DEFENSE DID NOT
[000:37:12;570] WANT LOPEZ TO TESTIFY LIVE...
[000:37:15;606] BUT TO PUT HER ON TAPE... AND
[000:37:17;108] DECIDE LATER WHETHER TO USE
[000:37:17;842] HER...
[000:37:20;211] BUT TO MAINTAIN CREDIBILITY,
[000:37:21;278] THEY HAD TO ASK TO PUT HER ON
[000:37:22;046] THE STAND OUT OF ORDER.
[000:37:23;981] BURRIS--Its one of those
[000:37:24;682] axioms, be careful what you ak
[000:37:25;482] for you might get it.
[000:37:39;831] ANALYSTS SAY THE DEFENSE TEAM
[000:37:41;699] MUST BE KICKING THEMSELVES
[000:37:42;867] TONIGHT... THAT THE LAST THING
[000:37:43;701] THEY EXPECTED WAS FOR
[000:37:45;436] PROSECUTORS TO AGREE TO TAKE A
[000:37:46;670] DEFENSE WITNESS IN THE MIDDLE
[000:37:47;605] OF THE PROSECUTION'S CASE.
[000:37:49;841] BUT ANALYSTS ALSO SAY, THAT
[000:37:51;408] THE PROSECUTION HAS BEEN TAKING
[000:37:52;376] SOME HITS IN THE LAST FEW
[000:37:54;779] DAYS... WITH THE BIT -BY-BIT
[000:37:55;679] DISSECTION OF THEIR POLICE
[000:37:56;413] WITNESSES...
[000:37:57;982] AND THAT ROSA LOPEZ OFFERS A
[000:38:00;684] BIT OF A DIVERSION... AND AN
[000:38:02;019] OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW WHAT
[000:38:03;520] PROSECUTORS WILL SURELY PORTRAY
[000:38:04;989] AS A DESPERATE DEFENSE ATTEMPT
[000:38:06;057] TO CONFUSE THE JURY...
[000:38:07;358] DENNIS, ELAINE?

[000:40:39;007] REGISTRATION ARE MORE LIKELY TO
[000:40:40;008] HAVE ACCIDENTS AND LEAVE THE

[000:40:43;211] BUT THE CAR STOP UPSET PEOPLE
[000:40:45;213] IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TONIGHT .

[000:41:01;862] are going to transfer their

[001:36:49;671] EASTRIDGE MALL.
[001:36:50;773] IT'S ALSO SURROUNDED
[001:36:52;108] BY HOMES AND SCHOOLS.
[001:36:53;542] >> THE SAFETY
[001:36:55;244] OF THE CHILDREN, TOO CLOSE
[001:36:56;278] TO NEARBY SCHOOLS.
[001:36:57;179] >> THE FIRST ACCIDENT
[001:36:57;980] INVOLVED A TWO-SEATER
[001:36:58;647] PLANE.
[001:36:59;548] IT WENT DOWN JUST OUTSIDE
[001:37:01;217] THE AIRPORT FIELD, INCHES
[001:37:02;417] AWAY FROM TRAFFIC ON TULLY
[001:37:04;452] ROAD, AND IMMEDIATELY WENT
[001:37:05;386] UP IN FLAMES.
[001:37:06;821] PATRICK KELLEHER WAS
[001:37:07;588] ON HIS WAY TO WORK
[001:37:08;223] AT EASTRIDGE MALL.
[001:37:09;490] HE STOPPED TO HELP.
[001:37:11;793] >> THE PASSENGER GOT OUT
[001:37:14;662] PRETTY QUICK, BECAUSE BY
[001:37:15;663] THE TIME I GOT TO THAT
[001:37:16;697] SIDE OF THE PLANE HE WAS
[001:37:18;233] ALREADY CRAWLING OVER TO
[001:37:18;867] GET OUT THAT DOOR, AND I
[001:37:21;136] MERELY HAD TO GIVE HIM A
[001:37:22;237] HAND.
[001:37:22;737] I'M SURE HIS CLOTHES GOT
[001:37:24;973] SINGED, BUT THE OTHER GUY
[001:37:26;174] WAS ON FIRE.
[001:37:26;908] I MEAN, HIS HAIR WAS ON
[001:37:28;109] FIRE.
[001:37:29;844] HIS HEADSET WAS MELTING ON
[001:37:32;546] TO HIS HEAD.
[001:37:33;882] IT WAS PRETTY GRUESOME.
[001:37:35;716] >> THE PILOT IS
[001:37:36;284] IN CRITICAL CONDITION.
[001:37:36;918] THE PASSENGER, HIS 17
[001:37:37;518] YEAR-OLD NEPHEW, IS
[001:37:38;319] IN SERIOUS CONDITION.
[001:37:39;453] THE ACCIDENT DIDN'STOP
[001:37:40;188] AIR TRAFFIC, THOUGH.
[001:37:40;889] LIGHT PLANES CONTINUED
[001:37:41;923] TO LAND, AND THAT'S WHEN
[001:37:42;723] THE SECOND ACCIDENT
[001:37:43;524] HAPPENED.
[001:37:45;059] A PLANE FLIPPED OVER.
[001:37:47;428] IN MUD.
[001:37:48;396] THIS TIME THERE WERE
[001:37:48;963] NO SERIOUS INJURIES.
[001:37:49;697] AIRPORT OFFICIALS SAY
[001:37:52;000] SINCE 1964 THERE HAVE BEEN
[001:37:53;701] 35 OFF-SITE CRASHES,
[001:37:55;303] BUT THEY STRESS NO ONE
[001:37:56;171] LIVING OR WORKING
[001:37:57;371] IN THE AREA WAS EVER
[001:37:59;207] KILLED OR SERIOUSLY
[001:37:59;874] INJURED.
[001:38:00;708] LINDA SCHULTE IS A PILOT
[001:38:01;843] AND NEARBY RESIDENT WHO
[001:38:03;477] DEFENDS THE AIRPORT
[001:38:04;145] LOCATION.
[001:38:05;847] >> THERE ARE CRASHES ALL
[001:38:09;217] THE TIME AT ANY AIRPORT.
[001:38:10;351] IF YOU CHECK ANY AIRPORT
[001:38:12;987] RECORDS, IT'S JUST WE'RE
[001:38:14;088] UNDER THE MAGNIFYING GLASS
[001:38:15;889] HERE, AND IT HAPPENS ALL
[001:38:16;824] THE TIME.
[001:38:17;925] >> WORKERS AT THE AIRPORT
[001:38:18;591] INSIST IT HAS
[001:38:19;059] THE REPUTATION OF BEING
[001:38:19;693] ONE OF THE SAFEST

[001:39:25;925] GUADALUPE RIVER SPILLED
[001:39:27;159] OVER ITS BANKS AND FLOODED
[001:39:28;227] THE DOWNTOWN AREA.
[001:39:30;196] THE FLOODING IS A RESULT OF TWO
[001:39:31;530] AND A HALF DAYS OF HEAVY RAIN.
[001:39:33;165] WE BEGIN OUR COVERAGE
[001:39:34;400] WITH SOUTH BAY BUREAU CHIEF

[001:39:40;639] >> THINGS ARE LOOKING MUCH
[001:39:42;708] BETTER TONIGHT.
[001:39:43;342] FOR NOW THE FLOODWATERS HAVE
[001:39:45;144] RECEDED.
[001:39:45;811] BEHIND ME SANTA CLARA STREET
[001:39:47;479] AND JUST A FEW HOURS AGO UNDER
[001:39:49;715] FOUR FEET OF WATER.
[001:39:50;682] IT'S NOW PASSABLE, OPEN,
[001:39:52;451] TRAFFIC IS GOING UP AND DOWN
[001:39:53;619] THE STREET.
[001:39:54;586] THE GUADALUPE RIVER AT ONE
[001:39:56;088] POINT, THIS RIVER WAS 16 FEET
[001:39:58;724] HIGH.
[001:39:59;825] AND FLOODED.
[001:40:00;426] IT WAS GOING OVER ITS BANKS.
[001:40:02;228] IT'S NOW DOWN ABOUT 14 FEET, TO
[001:40:04;863] GIVE YOU AN IDEA, LAST NIGHT AT
[001:40:06;332] THIS TIME IT WAS ONLY 6 FEET
[001:40:08;000] HIGH.
[001:40:08;600] NOW, THIS RIVER CAUSED A LOT OF
[001:40:10;803] PROBLEMS THROUGH SAN JOSE AND
[001:40:12;171] HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
[001:40:13;439] TONIGHT AND THROUGHOUT EARLIER
[001:40:14;907] TODAY IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE.
[001:40:18;677] >>> WORKERS FOR THE DEANZA
[001:40:19;645] HOTEL ON SANTA CLARA STREET
[001:40:20;646] TONIGHT REMOVED THE SANDBAGS
[001:40:22;348] THEY HAD PLACED IN FRONT
[001:40:23;449] OF THE HOTEL EARLIER TODAY.
[001:40:24;951] WATER DID CREEP INTO
[001:40:26;018] THE BASEMENT OF THE HOTEL
[001:40:26;986] CAUSING SOME DAMAGE.
[001:40:29;388] >> We understand there's more
[001:40:30;522] rain coming another problems
[001:40:32;024] but we're expecting to just
[001:40:35;026] keep our tractor on standby
[001:40:37;062] here with bags in it and we had
[001:40:38;497] a 20 minute response time
[001:40:39;898] to drop them all back in place
[001:40:41;667] so if it comes up, we're ready,
[001:40:42;801] but we're hoping the worst is
[001:40:44;470] past.
[001:40:46;237] >> DAMAGE WAS GREATER
[001:40:47;238] AT THE COMMONWEALTH TITLE
[001:40:48;306] OFFICE ACROSS THE STREET.
[001:40:49;508] WORKERS HERE ABANDONED
[001:40:50;742] THEIR OFFICES AS THE WATERS
[001:40:51;710] ROSE, BUT THEY PUT ALL
[001:40:53;078] THEIR PAPERWORK UP ON DESKS
[001:40:54;379] AND TABLES BEFORE THEY FLED.
[001:40:57;015] SAN JOSE'S CIVIC CENTER ALONG
[001:40:58;149] FIRST STREET REMAINS FLOODED
[001:40:59;184] AND THE HENRY'S HIGH LIFE
[001:41:00;519] RESTAURANT ON RIVER STREET IS
[001:41:01;587] NOW IN THE RIVER ALONG
[001:41:04;556] WITH A FEW SUBMERGED CARS.
[001:41:07;025] SANDBAGS REMAIN AT THE READY
[001:41:08;226] AT THE SAN JOSE ARENA.
[001:41:10;028] WATER CAME CLOSE AND THREATENED
[001:41:11;396] TO MAKE THE SHARK TANK
[001:41:12;798] INTO A WATER TANK FOR A WHILE.
[001:41:14;132] THE FLOODING DID CAUSE
[001:41:15;968] CANCELLATION OF TONIGHT'S
[001:41:17;235] SCHEDULED HOCKEY GAME.
[001:41:31;884] THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
[001:41:33;218] EARLIER TODAY WHEN
[001:41:34;219] THE GUADALUPE RIVER SUDDENLY
[001:41:35;387] OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS
[001:41:36;287] IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE.
[001:41:38;590] ABOUT 30 RESIDENTS MADE HASTY
[001:41:39;758] EVACUATIONS.
[001:41:41;393] THE OWNER OF THE HIGH LIFE
[001:41:42;394] RESTAURANT WAS ONE OF THEM.
[001:41:45;964] >> WE CAME IN, WE WERE PREPARED
[001:41:48;299] FOR MATTER ABOUT, WATER ABOUT
[001:41:50;301] AS HIGH AS IT WAS LAST TIME.
[001:41:52;470] NEVER EXPECTED IT TO GET THIS
[001:41:54;572] HIGH.
[001:41:55;073] IT'S WAIST DEEP AT THE FRONT
[001:41:56;674] HIGH OF THE HI LIFE.
[001:41:58;209] ITS JUST HAPPENED SUDDENLY.
[001:41:59;810] THE BANKS OF THE RIVER
[001:42:01;612] OVERFLOWED AND IT GUSHED DOWN
[001:42:02;813] THERE.
[001:42:03;681] DUMPSTERS WERE FLOATING DOWN
[001:42:05;083] THE STREET.
[001:42:07;185] THERE WERE SUBMERGED CARS.
[001:42:09;354] THE CURRENT IS SO BAD THAT WE
[001:42:12;223] BARELY COULD WALK OUT OF THE
[001:42:13;324] WATER.
[001:42:15;460] >> WE ARE WORKING ON'S
[001:42:17;628] EVACUATING PEOPLE.
[001:42:19;230] YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO ON
[001:42:20;598] THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIBBON
[001:42:22;067] RIGHT NOW.
[001:42:23;535] >> FIREFIGHTERS HAD TO GO
[001:42:24;202] IN AND RESCUE SOME STRANDED
[001:42:24;902] RESIDENTS.
[001:42:25;570] THE WATER WAS WAIST HIGH
[001:42:26;304] AND A STRONG CURRENT MADE IT
[001:42:27;004] DIFFICULT TO WALK IN THE RISING
[001:42:27;772] WATER.
[001:42:31;742] >> I WAS ASLEEP AND SOMEBODY
[001:42:33;411] PAGED ME.
[001:42:33;945] I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND MY
[001:42:35;646] CAR'S UNDERWATER.
[001:42:36;881] MY HOUSE IS UNDERWATER.
[001:42:38;349] SO I'M LEAVING.
[001:42:43;288] IT'S BEEN 40 YEARS SINCE THE
[001:42:45;390] GUADALUPE RIVER ROSE TO SUCH
[001:42:47;358] THE HEIGHT AND FLOODED DOWNTOWN
[001:42:49;360] SAN JOSE.
[001:42:49;760] OF COURSE, SAN JOSE NOW IS MUCH
[001:42:51;796] MORE DEVELOPED AND IS, THERE IS
[001:42:54;065] GREATER FEAR THAT IT COULD
[001:42:55;099] CAUSE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS.
[001:42:56;366] ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I NOTICE
[001:42:57;468] RIGHT NOW IS THAT ALL THE
[001:42:59;336] DEBRIS THAT'S COMING DOWN HERE,
[001:43:02;506] IT'S CLOGGING THE CHANNELWAY.
[001:43:04;041] IF IT CONTINUES LIKE THIS, IT
[001:43:06;410] BECOMES A DAMN AND THERE COULD
[001:43:08;079] BE MAJOR PROBLEMS.
[001:43:09;113] FOR NOW PEOPLE ARE WAITING AND
[001:43:10;881] SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT
[001:43:12;617] HERE IN DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE
[001:43:14;051] >>
[001:43:14;318] >> ARE THERE EFFORTS UNDERWAY
[001:43:16;320] IN THE CITY TO PREVENT THIS
[001:43:17;888] FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?
[001:43:18;555] >> THE GUADALUPE IS UNDERGOING
[001:43:20;858] A FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT.
[001:43:22;459] PART OF IT IS FINISHED.
[001:43:24;528] MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE.
[001:43:25;529] MORE OF THAT DEPENDS ON FEDERAL
[001:43:27;598] FUNDINGMENT POLITICS PLAYS A
[001:43:29;033] ROLE IN THIS NOW.
[001:43:30;501] WITH ALL THE BUDGET CUTS THE
[001:43:32;003] CITY IS WONDERING WHETHER OR
[001:43:33;437] NOT THEY WILL BE AE TO
[001:43:35;239] COMPLETE THEIR FLOOD CONTROL
[001:43:37;642] PROJECT.
[001:43:38;142] >> THANK YOU, LLOYD.
[001:43:39;510] FLOODWATERS ALSO ROSE IN OTHER
[001:43:40;377] PARTS OF SAN JOSE TODAY.
[001:43:41;812] JUST SOUTH OF THE CIVIC CENTER
[001:43:42;947] AREA ARE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE
[001:43:44;115] PEOPLE WERE JUST RECOVERING
[001:43:45;716] FROM THE BATTERING THEY ENDURED
[001:43:47;118] DURING THE JANUARY STORMS.
[001:43:49;186] WHAT WAS IT LIKE TODAY
[001:43:50;354] FOR HOMEOWNERS AND SMALL
[001:43:51;388] BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE AREA,
[001:43:52;890] AS BOB MACKENZIE REPORTS IT WAS
[001:43:54;125] A CONSENSUS, MUCH WORSE.
[001:43:58;663] >> THIS IS THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL
[001:43:59;964] WE FOUND IN SAN JOSE WHO
[001:44:01;331] APPEARED TO BE ENJOYING THE
[001:44:03;034] WEATHER.
[001:44:03;901] FOR HUMANS CAUGHT IN SWIFTLY
[001:44:06;470] RISING WATER THIS MORNING, THE
[001:44:08;238] EXPERIENCE RANGED FROM SOGGY,
[001:44:10;207] MUCKY MISERY TO SHEER TERROR,
[001:44:12;309] NEAR THE MILLPOND MOBILE HOME
[001:44:17;013] PARK, A WALL OF WATER
[001:44:18;948] SURROUNDED THIS CAR.
[001:44:20;016] >> MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING ALL
[001:44:22;018] AT ONCE.
[001:44:22;952] THE WATER JUST HIT IT RIGHT IN
[001:44:24;921] THE FACE.
[001:44:26;290] WE COULDN'T GO NO FURTHER.
[001:44:28;525] UNTIL SOMEONE COME AND PICKEDIS
[001:44:30;894] UP.
[001:44:31;595] >> THERE WAS AN OLDER COUPLE
[001:44:33;230] TRYING TO DRIVE THROUGH ABOUT
[001:44:34;698] THREE FEET OF WATER AND GOT
[001:44:36;099] STUCK IN THE CAR AND SO WE
[001:44:37;301] ACTUALLY HAD TO CARRY THEM OUT
[001:44:38;669] TO PREVENT THEM FROM HAVING TO
[001:44:40;737] GET INTO THE COLD WATER.
[001:44:43;807] >> RESIDENTS THIS IS THE ONLY
[001:44:45;676] INDIVIDUAL WE FOUND IN SAN JOSE
[001:44:46;876] WHO APPEARED TO BE ENJOYING
[001:44:47;777] THE WEATHER.
[001:44:52;115] >> FOR SOME GOING THROUGH ALL
[001:44:53;483] THIS AGAIN WAS JUST TOO MUCH.
[001:44:55;952] IN CENTRAL SAN JOSE, SANDY BUZZ
[001:44:59;623] WATCHED THE WATER CLIMB UP THE
[001:45:03;193] WALKWAY SHE THOUGHT THINK WERE
[001:45:04;928] ABLE TO MOVE INTO SOON.
[001:45:06;230] >> IT'S VERY HARD ON YOU.
[001:45:09;299] WELL COULD HAVE STOCKED KLEENEX
[001:45:12;436] TISSUE.
[001:45:19;242] >> ALL MY WINDOWS ARE CROOKED.
[001:45:21;611] THAT DOOR DOESN'T SHUT.
[001:45:22;879] I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO
[001:45:24;013] DO.
[001:45:24;313] >> YOU'RE AFRAID IT'S GOING TO
[001:45:26;816] HAPPEN ALL OVER AGAIN?
[001:45:27;583] >> YEAH, IT'S GOING TO WASH IT
[001:45:29;518] EVEN FURTHER OFF
[001:45:30;586] >> THERE WERE THE USUAL JOKES
[001:45:32;922] ABOUT WATERFRONT PROPERTY BUT
[001:45:34;390] THEY WANT FUNNY TO PEOPLE
[001:45:36;092] WATCHING THEIR HOMES GO UNDER.
[001:45:39;595] THIS COUPLE RAN A RESTAURANT
[001:45:41;664] CALLED THE HI LIFE.
[001:45:43;233] IT'S WAIST DEEP AT THE FRONT
[001:45:45;101] DOOR OF THE HI LIFE.
[001:45:47;270] IT JUST HAPPENED SUDDENLY.
[001:45:48;471] IT WAS LIKE THE BANKS OF THE
[001:45:50;006] RIVER OVERFLOWED AND IT GUSHED
[001:45:51;908] DOWN THERE.
[001:45:52;642] DUMPSTERS WERE FLOATING DOWN
[001:45:53;442] THE STREET.
[001:45:55;979] THERE WERE SUBMERGED CARS.
[001:45:58;181] THE CURRENT IS SO BAD, WE
[001:46:01;350] BARELY COULD WALK OUT OF THE
[001:46:02;685] WATER.
[001:46:03;452] >> IT WAS LATE AFTERNOON BEFORE
[001:46:05;554] THE FLOOD APPEARED TO MODERATE.
[001:46:09;926] NONE TOO SOON FOR THIS LITTLE
[001:46:11;727] HOUSE.
[001:46:12;128] BY THEN THE BASEMENT WAS
[001:46:13;763] FLOODED.
[001:46:14;230] THEY HAD A PUMP GOING.
[001:46:16;666] >> WE'RE HOPING IT DOESN'T RAIN
[001:46:19;169] TONIGHT.
[001:46:19;535] IT'S GOING TO GET MY
[001:46:21;504] SUBFLOORING,
[001:46:22;338] >> IF IT GETS IN THE INSULATION
[001:46:24;273] I GOT TO PULL OUT THE
[001:46:25;541] INSULATION OUT AND PULL OUT THE
[001:46:27;176] FLOORS OUT.
[001:46:27;777] BUT SO FAR WE'RE WAITING.
[001:46:31;180] >> WHEN THE RAINS FINALLY
[001:46:32;715] STOPPED AND THE SUN CAME OUT
[001:46:34;149] ABOUT 3:30 IN THE AFTERNOON,
[001:46:36;118] THE FLOODING SEEMED TO SLOW
[001:46:37;486] DOWN A BIT AND SOME OF THE
[001:46:39;422] WORST PREDICTED DISASTERS
[001:46:41;056] DIDN'T HAPPEN.
[001:46:42;224] BUT THIS LEFT A LOT OF PEOPLE
[001:46:44;293] SHAKEN AND WONDERING WHAT
[001:46:45;795] HAPPENS WHEN THE NEXT STORM
[001:46:47;430] GETS HERE.
[001:46:47;863] IN SAN JOSE, BOB MacKENZIE FOR
[001:46:50;032] THE 10:00 NEWS.
[001:46:52;301] >> IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS,

[001:47:01;510] COME DOWN.
[001:47:03;245] THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS
[001:47:04;279] IN THE MOUNTAINS AS WELL.
[001:47:08;183] IFS ONCE AGAIN RAINING TONIGHT.
[001:47:10;319] FAITH FANCHER IS NEAR
[001:47:10;919] THE SUMMIT OF HIGHWAY 17
[001:47:11;554] TONIGHT WITH A LIVE REPORT.
[001:47:12;254] FAITH?
[001:47:13;723] >> IT'S RAINING ONCE AGAIN.
[001:47:15;123] IT'S BEEN COMING DOWN LIKE THIS
[001:47:16;592] FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND THAT
[001:47:17;860] CERTAINLY IS NOT GOOD NEWS FOR
[001:47:19;662] CALTRANS CREWS STILL TRYING TO
[001:47:21;697] CLEAN UP MUDSLIDES TONIGHT.
[001:47:23;366] I'M STANDING ON HIGHWAY 17
[001:47:25;267] SOUTHBOUND AND I CAN DO THIS
[001:47:27;069] BECAUSE SOUTHBOUND LANES ARE
[001:47:28;237] STILL CLOSED.
[001:47:29;372] I'M AT MA DRON ROAD AND YOU CAN
[001:47:31;974] ONLY GET THIS FAR IF YOU ARE A
[001:47:35;110] LOCAL RESIDENT.
[001:47:36;078] 17 IS CLOSED DOWN BECAUSE OF
[001:47:37;579] THIS, MUD, TONS OF IT BLOCKING
[001:47:39;882] ALL THE SO SOUTHBOUND LANES.
[001:47:44;819] >> WE'VE BEEN DOING A LITTLE
[001:47:46;955] BIT OF A MAZE AROUND HERE, ONE
[001:47:49;157] PART GETS CLEARED AND WE HEAD
[001:47:50;592] FOR THE CLEAR PART AND ANOTHER
[001:47:52;627] SLIDE COMES UP.
[001:47:56;231] I'VE LIVED AROUND THESE
[001:47:57;665] MOUNTAINS PRETTY MUCH ALL MY
[001:47:58;833] LIFE AND I'VE NEVER SEEN SO
[001:48:00;568] MANY SLIDES ON 17 ALL AT ONCE
[001:48:02;871] EXCEPT BACK IN JANUARY.
[001:48:07;009] >> BY DAY, YOU CAN SEE HOW
[001:48:10;245] INCREDIBLE IT IS.
[001:48:10;779] THERE ARE TWO MAJOR SLIDES
[001:48:12;714] BLOCKING SOUTHBOUND 17, ONE
[001:48:14;182] SOUTH OF REDWOOD ESTATES, THE
[001:48:16;985] OTHER JUST SOUTH OF THE SUMMIT.
[001:48:20;889] THESE HILLS RINGING HIGHWAY 17
[001:48:23;158] ARE SATURATED AND MORE WATER
[001:48:24;726] FROM THIS LATEST STORM BROUGHT
[001:48:26;461] THEM TUMBLING DOWN.
[001:48:28;297] TRAFFIC AT FIRST AS SWEEK
[001:48:30;899] SQUEAKING BY.
[001:48:32;100] THEN 17 WAS CLOSED ALL
[001:48:33;468] TOGETHER.
[001:48:34;069] BY EVENING, THE COMMUTE WAS ONE
[001:48:35;437] BIG MESS.
[001:48:37;872] THIS IS HIGHWAY 17 AT HIGHWAY 9
[001:48:40;775] ABOUT 5:00 THIS EVENING.
[001:48:42;777] THE CHP DIVERTED ALL TRAFFIC
[001:48:45;279] HERE EXCEPT FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS,
[001:48:47;014] THE RESULT OF BACKUP THAT WENT
[001:48:48;249] ON FOR MILES.
[001:48:49;551] >> I HAVE BEEN IN IT ABOUT AN
[001:48:50;785] HOUR NOW.
[001:48:52;019] >> WHAT DO YOU THINK?
[001:48:53;254] >> WELL, I HOPE I GET HOME.
[001:48:54;789] >> WHERE RU GOING?
[001:48:56;223] >> TO SANTA CRUZ.
[001:48:57;492] >> YOU GOT A LONG COMMUTE
[001:48:59;661] TONIGHT.
[001:49:00;094] >> PROBABLY LONGER THAN SHE
[001:49:01;529] THOUGHT.
[001:49:02;396] THE HIGHWAY PATROL SAYS THE
[001:49:03;631] ONLY WAY TO GET TO SANTA CRUZ
[001:49:04;999] TONIGHT IS TAKE 101 TO STATE
[001:49:07;201] ROAD 152, TO WATSONVILLE.
[001:49:09;871] A LONG DIVERT.
[001:49:14;308] SMALL COMMUNITIES IN THE SANTA
[001:49:15;877] CRUZ MOUNTAINS HAVE BEEN
[001:49:16;811] BATTLING THE VIOLENT FORCES OF
[001:49:18;379] MOTHER NATURE ALL DAY AND
[001:49:19;781] MOTHER NATURE HAS HAD THE UPPER
[001:49:21;549] HAND.
[001:49:21;883] THE HE HAVE I RAIN AND WINDS
[001:49:23;618] HAVE FLOODED HOMES, KNOCKED
[001:49:25;653] DOWN POWER LINES AND FORCED
[001:49:28;322] EVACUATIONS.
[001:49:29;190] GROUPS IN BEN LOMOND AND OTHER
[001:49:30;992] COMMUNITIES ARE ASKING FOR
[001:49:33;394] DONATIONS FOR FLOOD VICTIMS.
[001:49:35;262] IN SARATOGA TONIGHT, ONE FAMILY
[001:49:37;231] IS COUNTING THEIR BLESSINGS.
[001:49:39;233] NO ONE WAS INJURED.
[001:49:40;602] THEIR HOME IN THIS COMMUNITY ON
[001:49:42;403] MOUNTAIN WAY WAS HIT BY A
[001:49:44;672] MUDSLIDE AND KNOCKED THE HOUSE
[001:49:46;374] OFF ITS FOUNDATION AND CAUSED
[001:49:48;009] ONE SIDE TO CAVE IN.
[001:49:49;543] A NEIGHBOR HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.
[001:49:50;744] >> IT SOUNDED LIKE A
[001:49:53;279] THUNDERSTORM, YOU KNOW, I
[001:49:54;882] THOUGHT PROBABLY A THUNDERSTORM
[001:49:56;316] OUTSIDE AND I LOOK OUTSIDE AND
[001:49:57;317] I SAID, THIS, THE MUD WAS, YOU
[001:50:00;921] KNOW, THE FOUNDATION WAS
[001:50:03;490] FALLING, WAS FALLING DOWN.
[001:50:04;691] >> WERE YOU WORRIED IT MIGHT
[001:50:06;927] COME DOWN INTO YOUR HOUSE?
[001:50:08;428] >> YES, YES.
[001:50:09;262] >> THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS IN
[001:50:10;564] ALL OF THIS.
[001:50:11;798] HIGHWAY 17 NORTHBOUND IS OPEN
[001:50:14;868] TONIGHT, ALTHOUGH, IN CERTAIN
[001:50:16;670] AREAS, YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN TO
[001:50:18;605] ONE LANE AND SQUEAK BY BECAUSE
[001:50:21;207] THERE ARE SOME MUDSLIDES.
[001:50:22;609] THE CHP SAYS IF YOU DON'T HAVE
[001:50:23;911] TO TRAVEL TONIGHT, JUST DON'T
[001:50:25;345] DO IT.
[001:50:26;279] IF YOU CAN STAY WITH FRIENDS OR
[001:50:28;248] IF YOU CAN STAY ON THE OTHER
[001:50:29;683] SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS, STAY
[001:50:30;918] THERE UNTIL TOMORROW.
[001:50:31;785] WE HAVE NO IDEA, CALTRANS SAYS
[001:50:34;588] THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THE
[001:50:36;023] SOUTHBOUND LANES ARE GOING TO
[001:50:36;990] BE OPENING UP.çÑYj.&Hg;çY
[001:50:40;060] LOOKED MORE LIKE THE MIGHTY
[001:50:41;327] MISSISSIPPI, TOTALLY OUT
[001:50:42;162] OF CONTROL.
[001:50:43;597] THE RUSHING WATERS SWEPT
[001:50:44;631] OVER THE BANKS AND
[001:50:45;599] OVER A BRIDGE JUST OFF CARMEL
[001:50:47;000] VALLEY ROAD INLAND
[001:50:48;301] FROM THE TOWN OF CARMEL.
[001:50:49;903] 2500 PEOPLE IN THE CARMEL
[001:50:51;004] VALLEY LEFT THEIR HOMES
[001:50:52;505] AND BUSINESSES AS THE RIVER
[001:50:53;473] ROSE.
[001:50:55;407] THREE SHOPPING CENTERS
[001:50:56;442] AT THE MOUTH OF THE VALLEY WERE
[001:50:57;342] FORCED TO CLOSE.
[001:50:58;444] SOME PEOPLE GOT OUT ONLY
[001:50:59;278] WITH THE HELP OF RESCUE
[001:51:00;446] WORKERS.
[001:51:01;714] AND SOME NEEDED HELP
[001:51:02;548] FROM A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER.
[001:51:04;283] IT LIFTED TEN PEOPLE TO SAFETY
[001:51:05;284] FROM ONE FLOODED RESIDENCE.
[001:51:07;386] A FLASH FLOOD AND MUD SLIDE
[001:51:08;754] WARNING FOR MONTEREY COUNTY WAS
[001:51:10;022] LIFTED LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO.
[001:51:12;658] BUT MORE RAIN IS EXPECTED.
[001:51:15;461] THE STORMS THAT HAVE POUNDED
[001:51:16;629] NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
[001:51:17;797] FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE
[001:51:18;831] DELIVERED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT
[001:51:19;832] OF WATER
[001:51:21;767] TAKE A LOOK AT THE RAINFALL
[001:51:22;635] FIGURES FOR THE PAST 72 HOURS.
[001:51:42;354] >>> THE RELENTLESS RAIN HAS
[001:51:43;455] PUSHED THE RUSSIAN RIVER
[001:51:44;657] ABOVE THE FLOOD LEVEL IN SONOMA
[001:51:45;625] COUNTY.
[001:51:47;292] A FLASH FLOOD WARNING IS
[001:51:48;327] IN EFFECT THERE TONIGHT
[001:51:49;895] AND FOR THE NAPA RIVER,
[001:51:51;030] IN NAPA COUNTY.
[001:51:52;231] MORE RAIN IS PREDICTED.
[001:51:54;266] ALONG THE RUSSIAN RIVER
[001:51:56;068] THE WATER LEVEL ACTUALLY
[001:51:57;136] FELL SOME TODAY.
[001:51:58;203] THE RIVER CRESTED AT JUST
[001:51:59;203] OVER 42 FEET IN
[001:52:00;304] GUERNEVILLE EARLY THIS
[001:52:01;205] MORNING, THEN RECEDED
[001:52:02;206] SEVERL FEET.
[001:52:03;374] THE PROBLEM IS THAT
[001:52:04;475] THE RIVER IS EXPECTED
[001:52:05;744] TO RISE AGAIN TONIGHT.
[001:52:06;778] AND THE PEOPLE WHO REMAIN
[001:52:08;146] ARE NOW FINDING IT
[001:52:09;147] DIFFICULT TO GET OUT
[001:52:10;314] AS ROADS GET WASHED OUT
[001:52:11;315] AND FLOODED OVER.
[001:52:13;217] HIGHWAY 116, SOUTH TOWARD
[001:52:14;619] SEBASTOPOL, IS CLOSED.
[001:52:20;258] >> IN NAPA COUNTY, A HUGE
[001:52:22;460] BUILD-UP OF WATER CREATED
[001:52:25;864] A SHOW AT LAKE HENNESSEY.
[001:52:27;966] THIS IS WHAT IDENTIFY
[001:52:29;934] LOOKED LIKE.
[001:52:30;468] SO MUCH WATER RUSHED, IT
[001:52:33;104] REPORTEDLY COLLAPSED A
[001:52:33;938] BRIDGE BELOW KAHN DAM.
[001:52:37;942] LAKE HENNESSEY IS LOCATED
[001:52:40;145] ALONG THE UPPER NAPA
[001:52:41;379] RIVER.
[001:52:45;550] >>> IN THE CITY OF NAPA,
[001:52:46;384] EOPLE REJOICED AS THE NAPA
[001:52:47;052] RIVER RECEDED TODAY.
[001:52:47;652] IT TOPPED OUT YESTERDAY
[001:52:48;286] EVENING AT NEAR
[001:52:48;920] OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE 1986
[001:52:49;654] RECORD OF 30.2 FEET.
[001:52:50;755] THAT'S FIVE FEET
[001:52:51;622] ABOVE FLOOD STAGE.
[001:52:52;657] THE WATERS FELL OVERNIGHT
[001:52:53;624] ABOUT AS QUICKLY
[001:52:54;425] AS THEY HAD RISEN.
[001:52:55;359] RITA WILLIAMS HAS
[001:52:56;260] OUR REPORT.
[001:52:58;997] >> NAPA AT NOON TODAY, IT
[001:52:59;898] WAS SAFE ENOUGH
[001:53:00;832] FOR A STROLL ACROSS
[001:53:01;700] THE RAIN-SWOLLEN NAPA
[001:53:02;901] RIVER.
[001:53:05;170] ALTHOUGH RAIN CONTINUED
[001:53:06;270] TO FALL, THIS TIME
[001:53:07;038] THE RIVER STAYED WITHIN
[001:53:07;739] ITS BANKS.
[001:53:12;475] BUT THAT WASN'T THE CASE
[001:53:13;476] LAST NIGHT AND VERY EARLY
[001:53:14;511] THIS MORNING.
[001:53:15;679] FOR THE SECOND TIME IN TWO
[001:53:16;847] MONTHS, FLOOD WATERS
[001:53:18;215] FILLED HOMES AND
[001:53:19;216] BUSINESSES.
[001:53:21;351] AUTHORITIES ORDERED NEW
[001:53:22;452] EVACUATIONS OF PEOPLE
[001:53:23;854] LIVING AND WORKING ALONG
[001:53:24;888] THE RIVER.
[001:53:27;624] WHAT A DIFFERENCE A FEW
[001:53:28;558] HOURS MAKE.
[001:53:30;227] THIS MORNING, THE FLOO
[001:53:31;261] WATERS WERE GONE
[001:53:32;295] BUT THEY HAD LEFT
[001:53:33;163] THEIR MARK.
[001:53:35;099] >> This is how high
[001:53:36;233] the line got in, about 23
[001:53:38;568] inches.
[001:53:40;704] I'm just glad the rain
[001:53:41;671] slowed down or it could
[001:53:42;940] have been a lot worse.
[001:53:44;942] >> EVEN THOUGH THE WATER
[001:53:46;009] HAD RECEDED A COUPLE
[001:53:47;377] OF FEET, THIS GARAGE WAS
[001:53:48;511] STILL FLOODED, THE WASHER
[001:53:49;980] AND DRYER MOVED TO HIGHER
[001:53:51;014] GROUND, OR SHOULD WE SAY,
[001:53:52;315] HIGHER PORCH.
[001:53:55;452] ON FIRST STREET, JUST
[001:53:56;486] A FEW DOORS AWAY,
[001:53:57;587] RUFFINO'S ITALIAN
[001:53:58;722] RESTAURANT REMAINED CLOSED
[001:54:00;357] IN PART BECAUSE THE FLOOR
[001:54:01;491] LOOKED LIKE A WADING POOL
[001:54:02;559] LAST NIGHT.
[001:54:07;430] THE CARPETS STILL WERE
[001:54:08;565] SOGGY TODAY, ALTHOUGH
[001:54:09;566] THE HIGH WATER WAS GONE.
[001:54:12;169] >> We can't really move,
[001:54:13;203] it's too expensive, so do
[001:54:15;305] the best we can.
[001:54:17;440] Everytime it rains you get
[001:54:18;375] kind of nervous.
[001:54:20;143] >> JOE RUFFINO'S FAMILY
[001:54:21;244] HAS OWNED THE RESTAURANT
[001:54:22;512] HERE SINCE 1942,
[001:54:24;447] BUT WITH THE RECENT DEATHS
[001:54:25;649] OF HIS GRANDPARENTS
[001:54:26;883] AND FATHER, THIS IS
[001:54:28;050] THE FIRST FLOOD HE'S GONE
[001:54:29;286] THROUGH ALONE.
[001:54:31;220] >> It's still raining,
[001:54:33;456] we're afraid to clean up
[001:54:34;991] too much because if it
[001:54:36;192] floods again, we have
[001:54:37;126] to start all over.
[001:54:38;428] >> THERE WAS ONLY ONE
[001:54:39;396] RESTAURANT OPEN DOWNTOWN
[001:54:40;397] TODAY AND THAT'S
[001:54:41;331] BECAUSE IT HAD
[001:54:42;231] A GENERATOR.
[001:54:46;536] THE REST OF THE AREA, MORE
[001:54:47;604] THAN 20,000 CUSTOMERS, HAD
[001:54:49;539] NO ELECTRICITY
[001:54:51;174] BECAUSE THIS PG AND E
[001:54:52;309] SUBSTATION FLOODED
[001:54:53;242] YESTERDAY.
[001:54:54;944] BUT A LITTLE DARKNESS
[001:54:56;012] DIDN'T STOP BREWSTER'S
[001:54:57;146] FROM OPENING ITS DOORS
[001:54:58;515] ON MAIN STREET TODAY.
[001:55:00;082] IT SPECIALIZES IN CAMPING
[001:55:01;484] AND OUTDOORS GEAR,
[001:55:02;619] SO FOLKS SHOPPED
[001:55:04;153] BY LANTERN TODAY.
[001:55:06;489] >> In a period from 7:00
[001:55:09;025] to l0:30 this morning,
[001:55:11;361] we sold alone about 200
[001:55:13;196] pairs of rubber boots.
[001:55:16;633] >> About 3:30 this
[001:55:17;634] afternoon, there was
[001:55:18;635] rejoicing in downtown Napa
[001:55:19;703] as the lights finally came
[001:55:20;770] back on, the sun tried
[001:55:21;838] to poke through the storm
[001:55:23;039] clouds and it stopped
[001:55:24;741] raining, however briefly.
[001:55:27;075] >> IN NAPA, RITA WILLIAMS.
[001:55:30;278] >>> THERE IS MUCH MORE

[001:57:01;068] >> Yes.
[001:57:01;903] >> What is it?
[001:57:03;070] >> A SHARP WOODEN STICK FUHRMAN
[001:57:04;572] SAYS HE FOUND ON THE GROUND NEAR
[001:57:05;606] O.J. SIMPSON'S FORD BRONCO
[001:57:07;475] THE MORNING AFTER THE KILLINGS.
[001:57:09;877] A LARGE PLASTIC BAG FUHRMAN SAYS
[001:57:11;345] HE SAW INSIDE THE BACK
[001:57:12;379] OF THE BRONCO.
[001:57:19;320] >> A TOWEL, AND ALSO
[001:57:20;321] FROM THE BRONCO, A SHOVEL.
[001:57:21;756] >> It looks like the shovel
[001:57:23;023] I saw in the rear cargo area
[001:57:23;858] of the Bronco.
[001:57:25;091] >> WHAT WERE PROSECUTORS
[001:57:26;025] PLYING?
[001:57:27;494] THAT O.J. WAS PLANNING TO KILL
[001:57:28;962] HIS EX-WIFE NICO BROWN
[001:57:30;464] SIMPSON, PLANNING TO BURY
[001:57:32;131] HER OR HIS BLOODY CLOTHES
[001:57:33;366] OR THE WEAPON, BUT DIDN'T GET
[001:57:35;001] THE CHANCE BECAUSE HE WAS CAUGHT
[001:57:36;102] OFF-GUARD BY RONALD GOLDMAN?
[001:57:38;538] PROSECUTORS NEVER SAID.
[001:57:42;809] EARLIER TODAY, MARCIA CLARK
[001:57:44;143] CONTINUED HER PREEMPTIVE STRIKE
[001:57:45;812] AGAINST AN ANTICIPATED DEFENSE
[001:57:47;814] ASSAULT ON MARK FUHRMAN'S
[001:57:48;915] CHARACTER.
[001:57:50;984] DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ACCUSE FUHRMAN
[001:57:52;251] OF BEING A RACIST COP
[001:57:54;220] WITH A GRUDGE AGAINST O.J.
[001:57:55;822] SIMPSON, EVEN SUGGESTING THAT
[001:57:57;958] FUHRMAN ACTUALLY FOUND BOTH
[001:58:00;393] BLOODY GLOVES NEAR THE BODIES,
[001:58:02;496] TOOK ONE OF THEM, AND PLANTED IT
[001:58:03;663] BEHIND O.J.'s HOUSE.
[001:58:05;732] BUT MARCIA CLARK GUIDED FUHRMAN
[001:58:07;300] THROUGH QUESTIONS DESIGNED
[001:58:08;935] TO SHOW FUHRMAN COULDN'T HAVE
[001:58:10;670] DONE THAT BECAUSE HE WAS ALMOST
[001:58:12;138] NEVER ALONE.
[001:58:14;307] >> As you walked through
[001:58:15;675] the house and stepped out
[001:58:16;877] on the landing to look out
[001:58:17;777] at the crime scene who was
[001:58:18;478] with you?
[001:58:20;213] >> Officer Riske and Det.
[001:58:21;347] Phillips When you stepped out
[001:58:22;649] the front door and walked down
[001:58:24;450] the walkway following the bloody
[001:58:26;786] shoeprints out to the alley who
[001:58:27;587] was with you?
[001:58:29;589] >> Officer Riske and Detective
[001:58:32;225] FLUPS.
[001:58:33;059] >> AND WHEN YOU EXITED
[001:58:35;895] the rear gate and went out
[001:58:36;829] to the driveway and observed
[001:58:37;530] the blood drop, the change, who
[001:58:40;400] WAS WITH YOU?
[001:58:41;134] >> OFFICER RISKE AND DETECTIVE
[001:58:42;502] PHILLIPS.
[001:58:46;039] >> DETECTIVE FUHRMAN
[001:58:49;042] SAID BY THE TIME HE FIRST
[001:58:49;909] ARRIVED AT THE BUNDY DRIVE CRIME
[001:58:50;676] SCENE, THEREALREADY
[001:58:51;344] NUMEROUS OTHER OFFICERS THERE.
[001:58:52;078] HE DISPLAYED SOME NOTES HE TOOK
[001:58:52;845] SHORTLY AFTER RR.
[001:58:53;879] FUHRMAN TESTIFIED THAT WHEN
[001:58:54;780] HE JOTTED DOWN THIS NOTE
[001:58:55;614] ABOUT THE GLOVE AND A SKI CAP,
[001:58:56;715] HE WAS ONLY NOTING WHAT
[001:58:57;850] THE FIRST OFFICER ON THE SCENE
[001:58:59;785] DESCRIBED TO HIM.
[001:59:01;720] >> Had you gone up to it
[001:59:03;356] and lifted it and held it
[001:59:04;590] and looked at it when you wrote
[001:59:05;391] that note sir?
[001:59:06;759] >> No, I did not.
[001:59:08;428] >> DEFENSE ATTORNEYS HAVE NOT
[001:59:09;828] ONLY ACCUSED FUHRMAN OF HAVING
[001:59:12;065] A GRUDGE AGAINST O.J., THEY'VE
[001:59:13;433] SUGGESTED HE CRAVED
[001:59:14;967] A RELATIONSHIP WITH NICOLE.
[001:59:17;403] SIMPSON'S ATTORNEYS FIND IT
[001:59:18;804] CURIOUS THAT IS WAS ONE MAN,
[001:59:21;006] MARK FUHRMAN, WHO FOUND
[001:59:22;341] THE BLOOD SPOTS ON SIMPSON'S
[001:59:24;444] BRONCO, WHO FIRST HOPPED
[001:59:26;512] THE WALL AT O.J.'s HOUSE AND WHO
[001:59:27;913] FOUND THE BLOODY GLOVE.
[001:59:30;183] >> As I walking past the vehicle
[001:59:32;218] I noticed a small spot
[001:59:33;953] above the door handle
[001:59:35;688] of the driver's side
[001:59:36;589] of the vehicle.
[001:59:39;625] >> And why did that attract
[001:59:40;526] your attention?
[001:59:42;228] >> Well the vehicle as you can
[001:59:43;429] see is white and it stood out
[001:59:44;630] somewhat as a very clean
[001:59:46;098] vehicle.
[001:59:47;866] >> FUHRMAN TESTIFIED HE JUST
[001:59:49;134] HAPPENED ON THE BLOOD SPOTS
[001:59:50;803] AS DETECTIVES LANGE, VANNATER
[001:59:52;137] AND PHILLIPS WERE TRYING
[001:59:53;572] TO ROUSE SOMEONE INSIDE
[001:59:55;440] SIMPSON'S HOUSE THROUGH
[001:59:56;475] AN INTERCOM AT THE GATE.
[001:59:58;711] BLOOD ON THE BRONCO, NO ANSWER
[002:00:00;212] AT THE GATE.
[002:00:01;346] FUHRMAN SAID THE DETECTIVES
[002:00:03;448] BECAME WORRIED.
[002:00:05;117] >> AT SOME POINT
[002:00:07;219] the conclusion was made by Det.
[002:00:08;286] Vanatter that we would have
[002:00:10;122] to find a way to get
[002:00:13;425] into the compound at 360 North
[002:00:14;326] Rockingham.
[002:00:19;999] >> What happened next?
[002:00:21;700] >> There was a question on how
[002:00:23;068] we were going to do this
[002:00:24;469] and I suggested do you want me
[002:00:25;303] to go over the wall?
[002:00:28;974] >> You were the most junior
[002:00:30;075] detective, is that correct?
[002:00:31;110] >> Yes, ma'am.
[002:00:32;310] >> And were you in best physical
[002:00:33;211] shape of the four detectives
[002:00:34;046] there?
[002:00:38;250] >> Well, you kind of put me
[002:00:39;484] on the spot but, I think I was
[002:00:41;219] the tallest detective.
[002:00:45;090] >> You were certainly
[002:00:45;924] the youngest?
[002:00:46;759] >> I was the youngest, yes.
[002:00:48;426] >> FUHRMAN TESTIFIED THAT AFTER
[002:00:49;461] HE HOPPED THE WALL AND OPENED
[002:00:50;428] THE GATE, THE FOUR DETECTIVES
[002:00:51;964] KNOCKED ON THE FRONT DOOR
[002:00:53;330] AND GOT NO ANSWER.
[002:00:55;199] THEY THEN WALKED AROUND
[002:00:56;768] THE BACK, BY THE POOL
[002:00:58;102] TO THE GUESTHOUSE, KNOCKED
[002:00:59;971] ON THIS DOOR AND WOKE UP KATO
[002:01:01;105] KAELIN.
[002:01:03;641] >> I asked him if I could just
[002:01:07;045] do a short test on him just
[002:01:08;880] to make sure he wasn't
[002:01:11;082] under the influence.
[002:01:13;051] >> FUHRMAN SAID THAT HE STAYED
[002:01:14;585] BEHIND AND TALKED TO KATO
[002:01:16;187] IN KATO'S BEDROOM, WHILE
[002:01:17;722] THE OTHER THREE DETECTIVES WENT
[002:01:19;290] TO O.J.'S DAUGHTER ARNELLE'S
[002:01:20;624] ROOM.
[002:01:23;327] >> He said about 10:45 PM
[002:01:27;598] the previous night, I believe
[002:01:29;901] he said he was talking
[002:01:33;370] on the phone he said he heard
[002:01:35;606] a crash or a thump on his wall.
[002:01:37;942] He thought there was going to be
[002:01:38;876] an earthquake.
[002:01:40;477] >> FUHRMAN HAS PREVIOUSLY SAID
[002:01:41;679] IT WAS THAT THUMPING SOUND THAT
[002:01:42;880] LED HIM TO LOOK BEHIND THE GUEST
[002:01:44;648] HOUSE AND HAPPEN ON THE BLOODY
[002:01:45;783] GLOVE.
[002:01:47;518] HE DIDN'T GET THAT FAR
[002:01:48;619] IN HIS TESTIMONY TODAY.
[002:01:51;055] AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY F. LEE
[002:01:52;690] BAILEY DIDN'T GET HIS TURN
[002:01:53;858] TODAY.
[002:01:55;492] HIS TURN TO RIP INTO FUHRMAN
[002:01:56;694] DURING CROSS EXAMINATION.
[002:01:59;030] INSTEAD, BAILEY SAT QUIETLY,
[002:02:01;599] ALMOST MOTIONLESS LIKE A WISE
[002:02:03;334] OLD LION LYING IN WAIT.
[002:02:05;869] RANDY SHANDOBIL FOR THE TEN
[002:02:06;837] O'CLOCK NEWS.
[002:02:09;273] >> A DEFENSE SOURCE TONIGHT
[002:02:10;474] SHRUGGED OFF THE PRESENCE
[002:02:11;742] OF A SHOVEL IN O.J. SIMPSON'S
[002:02:13;043] BRONCO..
[002:02:13;977] SAYING IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO CARRY
[002:02:14;878] ONE IN A FOUR-WHEEL-DRIVE
[002:02:16;247] VEHICLE THAT COULD GET STUCK
[002:02:17;214] SOMEWHERE OFF THE ROAD.
[002:02:18;749] BUT FOR THEIR PART, PROSECUTION
[002:02:19;816] SOURCES ARE ONLY DROPPING HINTS
[002:02:21;151] NOT SAYING FOR SURE WHAT
[002:02:23;354] THEY INTEND TO SHOW WITH TODAY'S
[002:02:24;622] MYSTERY EVIDENCE.
[002:02:26;257] COULD IT BE NOTHING MORE THAN
[002:02:27;791] BAIT TO LURE O.J. SIMPSON
[002:02:28;792] TO THE WITNESS STAND?
[002:02:30;026] JOHN FOWLER HAS TONIGHT'S EXPERT
[002:02:31;061] ANALYSIS.
[002:02:33;530] >> TODAY'S FRIDAY SURPRISE IS
[002:02:35;098] MORE LIKE A FRIDAY NIGHT MYSTERY
[002:02:37;301] AS PROSECUTORS SHOW THE JURY
[002:02:38;502] UNEXPLAINED BUT PROVOCATIVE
[002:02:39;903] EVIDENCE.
[002:02:41;739] A SHOVEL, LONG HANDLED,
[002:02:43;274] WITH WHICH ONE COULD DIG IN SOFT
[002:02:44;941] SOIL, A PLASTIC BAG LARGE ENOUGH
[002:02:46;977] TO HIDE PERHAPS BLOODY CLOTHES
[002:02:48;512] OR EVEN A BODY.
[002:02:50;648] A TOWEL, ONE COULD USE TO CLEAN
[002:02:51;948] UP AFTER A BLOODY ENCOUNTER.
[002:02:54;117] DOES ANY OF THIS PROVE ANYTHING?
[002:02:55;419] OUR ANALYSTS SAY NO.
[002:02:57;954] NOT YET, ANYWAY.
[002:02:59;556] >> I'm sure what the prosecution
[002:03:00;824] is doing is seeking to use
[002:03:02;293] the jury's imagination that
[002:03:05;162] he had the opportunity to bury
[002:03:08;431] these items or intended to bury
[002:03:10;366] them to create perhaps
[002:03:13;169] premeditation state of mind
[002:03:15;171] at the time he went
[002:03:16;172] over to the house.
[002:03:17;239] >> One of the objectives is
[002:03:18;274] to put enough evidence
[002:03:23;446] in the arena that only O.J.
[002:03:25;715] Simpson can testify to explain
[002:03:28;451] it and the double edge of this
[002:03:31;220] is not only to show guilt,
[002:03:32;488] but for the jury to ask "why
[002:03:34;490] isn't O.J. explaining this
[002:03:43;065] TO ME."
[002:03:45;935] >> CNN TONIGHT QUOTES
[002:03:50;105] AN UNNAMED KEY PROSECUTION
[002:03:51;106] SOURCE AS SAYING PROSECUTORS MAY
[002:03:51;874] TRY TO SHOW O.J. SIMPSON
[002:03:52;542] INTENDED TO BURY HIS EX-WIFE'S
[002:03:53;476] BODY, OR HIS OWN BLOCLOTHING
[002:03:54;977] IN A CANYON JUST A FEW MINUTES
[002:03:56;212] FROM HIS BRENTWOOD ESTATE.
[002:03:58;848] IN SHORT, THAT THIS WAS
[002:04:00;082] A CAREFULLY PLANNED KILLING THAT
[002:04:01;083] WENT AWRY.
[002:04:02;819] >> Remember, the prosecution
[002:04:03;986] theory was this was
[002:04:05;521] an interruption in a planned
[002:04:09;158] prmeditated act, the killing
[002:04:10;893] of Nicole Brown Simpson,
[002:04:12;561] the interruption was the coming
[002:04:14;096] along of Ron Goldman.
[002:04:17;099] >> OUR ANALYSTS SAY THE CASE'S
[002:04:18;467] MOST CONTROVERSIAL WITNESS
[002:04:20;336] APPEARS SOLID, IN COMMAND
[002:04:23;105] OF THE FACTS, A RESOURCEFUL COP,
[002:04:24;639] WHO APPARENTLY DID HIS JOB WELL.
[002:04:26;775] >> If you just look at what
[002:04:28;043] you see Mark Fuhrman
[002:04:29;544] without the baggage that's
[002:04:30;746] appeared in the newspapers,
[002:04:32;081] you'd say, at least today, this
[002:04:34;383] is a very good detective.
[002:04:36;451] >> AND THAT MARCIA CLARK IS
[002:04:37;519] BUILDING A SOLID WALL
[002:04:38;687] OF CREDIBILITY AROUND FUHRMAN.
[002:04:40;522] >> She did a good job of taking
[002:04:42;524] him through the evidence showing
[002:04:48;030] that he always had someone
[002:04:50;266] with him or did not have
[002:04:51;466] on the clothes at the time that
[002:04:52;801] would allow him to hide a bloody
[002:04:54;103] glove.
[002:04:55;938] >> BUT ANALYSTS SAY F. LEE
[002:04:57;373] BAILEY, APPEARED ALMOST LIKE
[002:04:59;308] A PREDATOR, STALKING PREY, EAGER
[002:05:00;910] TO POUNCE.
[002:05:03;012] BAILEY EYED FUHRMAN, NEVER TOOK
[002:05:04;746] NOTES, NEVER VOICED EVEN
[002:05:06;081] A SINGLE OBJECTION.
[002:05:08;617] HIS BODY LANGUAGE SURELY TRYING
[002:05:10;819] TO INTIMIDATE THE DETECTIVE..
[002:05:12;121] WHO JUST AS SURELY KNOWS WHAT
[002:05:13;355] HE'S IN FOR.
[002:05:14;656] >> The challenge for him is
[002:05:17;092] whether hes able to withstand
[002:05:18;360] the sledgehammer cross
[002:05:22;697] examination by F. Lee Bailey.
[002:05:25;099] >> CHANNEL 2 ANALYSTS SAY A LOT
[002:05:26;301] IS RIDING ON FUHRMAN'S
[002:05:27;402] PERFORMANCE.
[002:05:29;070] FORMER L.A. POLICE CHIEF DARRYL
[002:05:30;939] GATES REPORTEDLY HELPED PREPARE
[002:05:33;107] FUHRMAN FOR HIS TESTIMONY.
[002:05:35;577] AND THAT IT APPEARS THE POLICE
[002:05:36;745] DEPARTMENT, SO CRITICIZED
[002:05:38;246] FOR ITS HANDLING OF THIS CASE,
[002:05:40;449] LOOKS FOR VINDICATION FROM THIS
[002:05:42;183] DETECTIVE, WHO'S ACCUSED
[002:05:44;152] OF RACISM AND POSSIBLY PLANTING
[002:05:45;253] EVIDENCE.
[002:05:47;021] >> It seems to me the department
[002:05:49;223] want to do is hold him up
[002:05:51;726] and say you're all wrong
[002:05:53;728] about Mark fuhrman,
[002:05:54;729] and about the LAPD,
[002:05:57;131] and therefore a lot is vested
[002:05:58;600] in Mark Fuhrman.
[002:06:01;336] >> OUR ANALYSTS ALSO QUESTION
[002:06:02;604] THE TIMING OF THE PROSECUTION'S
[002:06:04;439] INTRODUCING THE EVIDENCE TODAY,
[002:06:06;107] THAT IT MIGHT HAVE MADE A BIGGER
[002:06:07;476] IMPACT TO PUT ON THE BLOODY
[002:06:08;477] GLOVE.
[002:06:10;144] BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IT DOES
[002:06:11;379] GIVE MYSTERY LOVERS SOMETHING
[002:06:12;747] DRAMATIC TO CHEW ON
[002:06:13;882] OVER THE WEEKEND.

[002:17:44;265] START OF SPRING?
[002:17:45;466] >>> AND IT'S GREEN ALL
[002:17:46;567] OVER THE STREETS OF SAN
[002:17:47;568] FRANCISCO.
[002:17:48;169] WE'LL GO TO ONE OF THE
[002:17:50;037] LARGEST BLOCK PARTIES
[002:17:50;804] AROUND.a>y8YD;E .
[002:17:53;774] THIS MOST IRISH
[002:17:54;841] OF HOLIDAYS IS A LOT MORE
[002:17:55;876] THAN JUST AN ETHNIC PARTY,
[002:17:56;743] AS WE LEARN FROM
[002:17:57;544] OUR RESIDENT IRISH LASS,
[002:17:58;812] MARTY URIBES.
[002:18:00;280] OR IS THAT O'RIBES?
[002:18:03;917] >> WELL, PETE, YOU CHANGE
[002:18:05;752] ONE LETTER IN MY NAME AND
[002:18:07;054] I CAN FIT INTO ALMOST ANY
[002:18:09;690] ETHNIC COMMUNITY.
[002:18:10;256] TAKE A LOOK AT THE PARTY
[002:18:11;357] OVER HERE.
[002:18:12;059] OVER 2,000 PEOPLE, AND IT
[002:18:13;593] LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN FULL
[002:18:14;761] SWING!
[002:18:15;595] IT'S A TIME FOR ALL THE
[002:18:16;496] FUN OF ST. PATRICK'S DAY,
[002:18:18;498] AS YOU CAN SEE ALL THE
[002:18:21;301] HARDCORE PARTIERS ARE OUT,
[002:18:22;235] BUT NOT ALL THESE PEOPLE
[002:18:23;203] ARE IRISH.
[002:18:23;970] I FOUND SOME IRISH FOLKS
[002:18:26;006] WHO SHARED THE TRUE
[002:18:27;273] MEANING OF ST. PATRICK'S
[002:18:28;709] DAY WITH ME.
[002:18:32;112] THE IRISH CULTURAL CENTER
[002:18:33;580] WAS A SPOT MANY IRISH
[002:18:35;082] FAMILIES GATHERED TO ENJOY
[002:18:36;049] A GOOD MEAL, LISTEN TO
[002:18:37;818] MUSIC AND COMMEMORATE THE
[002:18:39;252] IRISH HOLIDAY.
[002:18:40;053] FOR MANY HERE IT IS A TIME
[002:18:41;254] TO CELEBRATE.
[002:18:42;255] BUT THE IRISH DON'T FORGET
[002:18:43;957] WHAT ST. PATRICK'S DAY IS
[002:18:45;158] ALL B AS MANY AMERICANS
[002:18:46;492] TAKE TO THE STREETS AND
[002:18:48;528] BARS TO CELEBRATE, IRISH
[002:18:50;496] IMMIGRANTS REFLECT ON WHAT
[002:18:51;264] THE HOLIDAY MEANS IN THEIR
[002:18:52;799] MOTHER COUNTRY.
[002:18:53;466] SHAWN O'RIORDEN OFFERED
[002:18:55;001] THIS EXPLANATION TO
[002:18:56;636] BayTV'S TERRY McGOVERN
[002:18:57;270] THIS MORNING.
[002:18:58;739] >> I HAVE SUCH A DIFFERENT
[002:18:59;740] VIEW OF ST. PATRICK'S DAY,
[002:19:01;474] IT'S REALLY IS A DAY OF
[002:19:02;908] MOURNING THE DEATH OF
[002:19:03;743] SAINT PATRICK AND BECAUSE
[002:19:05;111] IT GOES BACK TO THE TIME
[002:19:05;945] OF THE WAKE AND THE
[002:19:07;479] MOURNING FROM THE
[002:19:10;382] PRECELTIC DAYS THAT SAINT
[002:19:12;351] PATRICK ALLOWED A LOT OF
[002:19:14;286] PAGANNISM TO CONTINUE IN
[002:19:15;320] IRE AND, SUCH AS THE SELL
[002:19:18;224] PARTICULAR CROSS, AND THE
[002:19:21;026] SELL PARTICULAR BELIEFS.
[002:19:23;129] >> WHILE THESE IRISH
[002:19:25;064] FAMILIES ENJOY THEIR
[002:19:26;565] HOLIDAY, A FEW TOOK
[002:19:27;666] TIME-OUT TO EXPRESS WHAT
[002:19:28;367] THEY WANT AMERICANS TO
[002:19:29;101] KNOW ABOUT THEIR CULTURE.
[002:19:31;036] >> UNDERNEATH EVERYTHING,
[002:19:32;404] WE ALL HAVE A VERY STRONG
[002:19:34;173] LOVE AND REGARD FOR OUR
[002:19:36;041] MOTHER COUNTRY.
[002:19:37;442] REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE
[002:19:38;277] ARE.
[002:19:38;610] >> THERE'S BEEN SO MANY
[002:19:40;079] FAMOUS WRITERS OUT OF
[002:19:41;280] IRELAND, AND I THINK
[002:19:43;082] THEY'RE KNOWN THROUGHOUT
[002:19:43;715] THE WORLD.
[002:19:44;216] I THINK THAT'S A REALLY
[002:19:45;684] GOOD THING TO BE PROUD OF,
[002:19:47;119] ESPECIALLY ON ST.
[002:19:47;653] PATRICK'S DAY.
[002:19:49;688] >> WHAT ABOUT ALL THE
[002:19:51;023] DRINKING AND GREEN AND
[002:19:53;159] CORN BEEF AND CABBAGE?
[002:19:54;860] >> AMERICANS HAVE A
[002:19:55;995] CERTAIN IDEA ABOUT HOW THE
[002:19:57;562] IRISH CELEBRATE.
[002:19:58;497] BUT WE CELEBRATE IT VERY
[002:20:00;032] QUIETLY AT HOME.
[002:20:01;000] IT A GREAT COMPLIMENT
[002:20:02;768] OUGHT IRISH THAT EVERYBODY,
[002:20:03;936] YOU KNOW, PAYS TRIBUTE TO
[002:20:06;872] THEM ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY.
[002:20:08;140] >> BY THE END OF TONIGHT
[002:20:09;474] POLICE SAY 10,000 PEOPLE
[002:20:10;742] WILL BE OUT HERE HONORING
[002:20:12;210] THE IRISH AND SAINT
[002:20:13;244] PATRICK.
[002:20:13;679] BUT WE HAVE TO WARN PEOPLE
[002:20:14;513] THAT THE POLICE WILL BE
[002:20:15;614] OUT HERE TOO, UNTIL IT'S
[002:20:17;416] ALL OVER AND PETE, THERE
[002:20:18;917] WILL ALSO BE SOME SOBRIETY
[002:20:21;286] CHECKPOINTS SO THOSE
[002:20:22;153] PEOPLE CELEBRATING A
[002:20:23;288] LITTLE TOO HD BETTER BE
[002:20:24;790] CAREFUL.
[002:20:25;156] >> THERE WILL BE SOME OF
[002:20:26;090] THAT, AS WELL, MARTY.
[002:20:27;359] THANK YOU.
[002:20:28;059] >> THE WEATHER TURNED OUT
[002:20:29;961] PRETTY GOOD FOR THIS IRISH
[002:20:31;196] DAY CELEBRATION.
[002:20:32;297] ZACH'S OVER AT THE BOARD
[002:20:33;898] TO TELL US IF IT CARRY
[002:20:35;133] THROUGH THE WEEKEND.
[002:20:36;335] LITTLE LUCK FOR THE
[002:20:37;135] WEEKEND?
[002:20:37;502] >> WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK ON
[002:20:38;804] WOOD TO GET A LITTLE IRISH
[002:20:40;104] LUCK.
[002:20:40;439] I THINK WE'RE IN FOR
[002:20:42;974] VINEYARDS ARE STILL SOGGY,
[002:20:45;310] BUT NO LONGER BURIED
[002:20:45;877] IN ACRE AND ACRE
[002:20:46;378] OF STANDING WATER.
[002:20:46;911] INSTEAD THEY ARE RINGED
[002:20:47;546] BY A WILDFLOWER CROP THAT
[002:20:48;213] IS EXPECTED TO BE
[002:20:48;747] AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE FLOODS
[002:20:49;481] WERE RUINOUS.
[002:20:51;115] EVEN THE MUSTARD FESTIVAL
[002:20:52;484] CANCELLED AFTER LAST
[002:20:53;552] WEEK'S RAIN GOT BACK
[002:20:54;519] ON TRACK, THOUGH IT WAS
[002:20:55;286] SPARSELY ATTENDED.
[002:20:57;121] UNLESS YOU NOTICED
[002:20:58;457] THE SANDBAGS THAT ARE
[002:20:59;090] IN PLACE ALMOST
[002:21:01;025] EVERYWHERE, YOU MIGHT NOT
[002:21:02;026] GUESS JUST HOW BAD
[002:21:03;194] THE AREA LOOKED TEN DAYS
[002:21:04;629] AGO, UNLESS YOU WERE ONE
[002:21:06;631] OF THE UNFORTUNATE 800
[002:21:07;566] PUSHED FROM YOUR HOME
[002:21:08;233] BY RISING WATER.
[002:21:12;170] AT VINEYARD VALLEY MOBILE
[002:21:13;204] HOME PARK, 200 OF THOSE
[002:21:14;239] PEOPLE STILL HAVE
[002:21:14;873] NO HOMES.
[002:21:16;607] THE SECURITY GUARD ON DUTY
[002:21:18;209] 24 HOURS A DAY TO KEEP
[002:21:18;910] AWAY THE CURIOUS
[002:21:19;610] AND THE CRIMINAL.
[002:21:23;348] >> KEEP FROM HAVING
[002:21:25;449] LOOTERS AROUND.
[002:21:26;517] IT'S PROBLEM THAT
[002:21:28;019] UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENS.
[002:21:28;853] WHEN THERE'S A DISASTER
[002:21:30;788] PEOPLE COME IN AND JUST
[002:21:32;490] PRETEND THEY'RE OUT HERE
[002:21:34;058] HELPING AND ACTUALLY
[002:21:34;625] AREN'T.
[002:21:35;894] >> HOMEOWNERS WERE FINALLY
[002:21:36;560] LET IN THIS WEEKEND
[002:21:37;128] TO SALVAGE WHAT
[002:21:37;628] THEY COULD.
[002:21:38;162] THOSE WHO WORKED ALL
[002:21:39;130] WEEKEND TO CART AWAY A FEW
[002:21:40;265] SOGGY ITEMS HAVE JUST
[002:21:41;665] ABOUT HAD IT.
[002:21:46;905] >> I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF
[002:21:48;839] THEM.
[002:21:49;340] TEXAS IS LOOKING BETTER
[002:21:50;341] ALL THE TIME.
[002:21:51;242] MY MOM AND DAD ARE TALKING
[002:21:52;676] ABOUT MOVING TO TEXAS AND
[002:21:53;611] IT'S LOOKING ALL THE --
[002:21:56;381] BETTER ALL THE TIME.
[002:21:57;415] >>> VINEYARD VALLEY GOT
[002:21:58;883] HIT SO HARD IN '86 AND
[002:22:00;584] AGAIN IN '95, THE LOCAL
[002:22:02;486] GOVERNMENT IS TALKING
[002:22:03;821] ABOUT NOT LETTING PEOPLE
[002:22:05;390] REBUILD IN THE PARK,
[002:22:06;524] BECAUSE THEY'LL SURELY GET
[002:22:08;059] HIT AGAIN AND THE
[002:22:09;060] GOVERNMENT CAN'T AFFORD TO
[002:22:10;661] KEEP REBAILING THEM OUT.
[002:22:12;563] THEY SAY THE NAPA RIVER
[002:22:14;399] CAN HANDLE THE FOUR INCHES
[002:22:15;800] OF RAIN PREDICTED AND EVEN
[002:22:17;535] THE RUNOFF.
[002:22:18;169] THEY HOPE.
[002:22:19;170] THEY HOPE.
[002:22:20;138] NOW THIS IS THE THIRD
[002:22:21;472] STREET BRIDGE IN DOWNTOWN
[002:22:22;907] NAPA, AND JUST TO GIVE YOU
[002:22:24;107] AN IDEA HOW MUCH ROOM THEY
[002:22:25;609] HAVE TO PLAY WITH, DURING
[002:22:27;678] THE LAST FLOODS THE WATER
[002:22:29;313] WAS UP TO THE ARCH ON THIS
[002:22:30;781] BRIDGE AND NOW YOU CAN SEE
[002:22:31;949] THE WATER LEVEL HAS
[002:22:33;283] DROPPED AT LEAST 15 FEET.
[002:22:34;652] LET'S HOPE THEY HAVE A LOT
[002:22:36;019] OF ROOM TO PLAY WITH.
[002:22:37;220] >> THANK YOU, NOEL.
[002:22:38;355] KIND OF REFRESHING TO HEAR
[002:22:40;858] OPTIMISTIC NEWS.
[002:22:42;726] >>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO
[002:22:43;427] LIVE ALONG THE RUSSIAN
[002:22:44;127] RIVER, MEANWHILE, BEING
[002:22:44;762] TOLD THEY MAY NEVER GO
[002:22:45;362] HOME AGAIN.
[002:22:45;930] NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE
[002:22:46;564] OFFICIALS SAY SOME PLACES
[002:22:47;297] HAVE FLOODED SO OFTEN
[002:22:48;432] OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS,
[002:22:49;399] THEY MAY JUST GIVE
[002:22:50;200] THE COUNTY MONEY TO BUY
[002:22:52;937] VULNERABLE LOCATIONS
[002:22:53;904] AND MOVE PEOPLE OUT.
[002:22:54;805] >>> TO THE NORTH, TWO
[002:22:55;639] AREAS IN LAKE COUNTY ARE
[002:22:56;306] BEING CLOSELY WATCHED
[002:22:56;907] TONIGHT.
[002:22:57;741] THEY ARE THE TOWNS
[002:22:58;642] OF LAKEPORT AND CLEARLAKE,
[002:23:00;811] WHICH ARE ON OPPOSITE
[002:23:01;545] SIDES OF CLEAR LAKE.
[002:23:03;814] THEY SUFFERED MORE THAN
[002:23:04;548] THEIR SHARE OF FLOODING
[002:23:05;349] LAST WEEK, AND THE WATER
[002:23:06;750] HASN'T RECEDED YET.
[002:23:08;318] SO FAR, ONLY LIGHT RAIN IS
[002:23:09;687] FALLING THERE TONIGHT,
[002:23:11;054] WITH NO NEW FLOODING
[002:23:11;622] REPORTED.
[002:23:12;857] >>> THIS STORM IS EXPECTED
[002:23:13;657] TO HIT THE SIERRA
[002:23:15;092] THE HARDEST, WITH WINDS UP
[002:23:16;026] TO 80 MILES AN HOUR
[002:23:17;094] AND A LOT OF SNOW.
[002:23:18;261] WITH THE LATEST
[002:23:20;063] ON THE SITUATION, WE HAVE
[002:23:21;431] LAURA ANTHONY LIVE IN BLUE
[002:23:22;099] CANYON.
[002:23:22;466] LAURA?
[002:23:24;267] >> WELL, TOM, AT THE
[002:23:25;302] MOMENT I THINK I NEED AN
[002:23:26;971] UMBRELLA BECAUSE IT
[002:23:27;671] ACTUALLY STARTED RAINING
[002:23:28;839] HERE ABOUT A HALF HOUR
[002:23:29;840] AGO.
[002:23:30;307] WE'RE AT ABOUT 5,000 FEET
[002:23:32;009] AND ALL EVENING IT'S BEEN
[002:23:33;343] A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND
[002:23:34;311] SNOW.
[002:23:34;645] THE WINDS ARE STARTING TO
[002:23:35;746] PICK UP NOW, AND ALL OF
[002:23:37;114] THIS OF COURSE IS A
[002:23:39;048] PRELUDE TO WHAT COULD BE
[002:23:39;983] ONE OF THE BIGGEST WINTER
[002:23:41;250] STORMSE SEASON.
[002:23:45;588] BY NIGHT FALL, THE SNOW
[002:23:47;223] WAS FALLING, EVEN AT
[002:23:49;158] ELEVATION 5,000 FEET.
[002:23:50;660] SPRING MAY START TOMORROW,
[002:23:51;728] BUT IT'S STILL GOING TO
[002:23:52;829] FEEL A LOT LIKE WINTER IN
[002:23:54;363] THE SIERRA, FOR SOME TIME.
[002:23:56;165] IN FACT, THE ALASKAN STORM
[002:23:59;101] FRONT COULD BE THE COLDEST
[002:24:00;036] OF THE SEASON SO FAR, WITH
[002:24:01;838] THE SNOW LEVEL DROPPING TO
[002:24:03;205] AS LOW AS 3500 FEET.
[002:24:06;442] FORECASTERS EXPECT AS MUCH
[002:24:07;610] AS FOUR TO FIVE FEET OF
[002:24:09;078] NEW SNOW AT THE HIGHER
[002:24:10;813] ELEVATIONS, WITH WIND
[002:24:11;848] GUSTS AS HIGH AS 70 MILES
[002:24:13;182] PER HOUR.
[002:24:15;718] IT SNOWED STEADILY THROUGH
[002:24:17;219] THE EVENING, BUT MOST OF
[002:24:18;087] IT WASN'T STICKING TO THE
[002:24:19;589] ROADWAY.
[002:24:20;056] NOT YET, ANYWAY.
[002:24:23;492] BUT WITH THE HEAVY SNOW
[002:24:25;194] FALL DUE TO HIT AFTER
[002:24:26;796] MIDNIGHT, CALTRANS ISN'T
[002:24:28;097] TAKING ANY CHANCES.
[002:24:29;465] >> WE'RE CALLING IN EXTRA
[002:24:31;100] HELP FROM THE VALLEY, AND
[002:24:32;168] WE GO ON 12-HOUR SHIFTS,
[002:24:34;336] SO THERE SHOULD BE ABOUT
[002:24:35;672] 20 OPERATORS ON, JUST AT
[002:24:37;040] THIS STATION ALONE, AFTER
[002:24:37;974] MIDNIGHT.
[002:24:39;308] >> THOSE OUT ON THE ROAD
[002:24:40;810] SHOULD BE READY FOR
[002:24:42;278] EXTREME WINTER CONDITIONS.
[002:24:44;413] >> WE'LL CERTAINLY BE
[002:24:45;181] PREPARED FOR THAT AND BE
[002:24:46;549] PREPARED FOR POSSIBLE
[002:24:47;850] DELAYS.
[002:24:48;350] COULD EVEN HAVE SOME ROAD
[002:24:49;886] CLOSURES, IF WE END UP
[002:24:51;054] WITH BLIZZARD CONDITIONS
[002:24:52;388] AND WHITE-OUT CONDITIONS,
[002:24:53;689] THAT COULD CAUSE THE
[002:24:54;489] HIGHWAY TO CLOSE.
[002:24:56;491] >> AS FOR THOSE SKI AREAS
[002:24:58;460] WHERE SNOW DEPTHS TOPPED
[002:24:59;995] 20 FEET, THEY COULDN'T
[002:25:01;329] POSSIBLY NEED ANY MORE
[002:25:02;598] SNOW, COULD THEY?
[002:25:04;132] ISN'T IT ENOUGH ALREADY?
[002:25:05;701] >> NOT REALLY.
[002:25:06;768] WE STILL HAVE PLENTY OF
[002:25:08;070] ROOM HERE ON THE SLOPES TO
[002:25:09;738] BE ABLE TO PUSH THE SNOW.
[002:25:11;306] >> BUT IT'S THE MIDDLE OF
[002:25:12;674] MARCH.
[002:25:13;475] SPRING STARTS TOMORROW AND
[002:25:15;276] YOU ARE STILL INTO THE
[002:25:17;479] SNOW.
[002:25:17;813] >> NEVER ENOUGH SNOW.
[002:25:18;680] >> I'M ASKING THE WRONG
[002:25:20;315] PERSON, RIGHT?
[002:25:20;782] >> YOU'VE GOT IT.
[002:25:21;516] >> WELL, THEY'RE GOING TO
[002:25:22;684] GET IT.
[002:25:23;418] AS MUCH AS FOUR, FIVE, SIX
[002:25:25;220] FEET OF SNOW AT THE HIGHER
[002:25:27;455] ELEVATIONS.
[002:25:27;889] OF COURSE RIGHT NOW IT'S
[002:25:29;290] RAINING, BUT ONCE THE RAIN
[002:25:31;259] TURNS TO SNOW, IT'S GOING
[002:25:32;494] TO BE COMING DOWN REALLY
[002:25:33;996] GOOD, AND AS FAR AS THE
[002:25:35;363] ROADWAYS ARE CONCERNED,
[002:25:36;598] RIGHT NOW THEY ARE OPEN
[002:25:37;733] AND FREE OF CONTROLS, TOM
[002:25:39;501] AND CATHERINE, BUT WE CAN
[002:25:40;802] EXPECT THAT TO CHANGE AS
[002:25:42;070] THE BRUNT OF THE SYSTEM

[002:26:32;920] THE HARDEST IN THIS ONE?

[002:26:37;658] I THINK THE SIERRA NEVADA
[002:26:41;162] WILL SEE THE MOST RADICAL
[002:26:43;363] WEATHER FROM THIS STORM,
[002:26:44;732] IN TERMS OF VERY STRONG
[002:26:46;567] WINDS AND VERY HEAVY SNOW.
[002:26:49;070] IT'S A LITTLE BITTERLY YET
[002:26:50;671] FOR THE SNOW TO BEGIN, BUT
[002:26:52;206] IT LOOKS LIKE LATE TONIGHT
[002:26:54;508] AND REALLY THROUGH
[002:26:56;010] TOMORROW NIGHT, THE RAIN
[002:26:57;211] THERE WILL TURN TO SNOW.
[002:26:58;579] IT WILL BECOME HEAVY AT
[002:26:59;947] TIMES AND THE WINDS SHOULD
[002:27:01;816] REACH 80 MILES AN HOUR OR
[002:27:03;751] MORE THROUGH THE PASSES
[002:27:05;019] AND OVER SOME OF THE
[002:27:06;120] RIDGES.
[002:27:06;987] WE EXPECT SEVERAL FEET OF

[002:27:10;024] TOMORROW AND TOMORROW
[002:27:10;825] NIGHT.
[002:27:11;826] >> THAT IS PRETTY RADICAL.
[002:27:13;293] IN THE BAY AREA IT SOUNDS
[002:27:14;294] LIKE THE NORTH BAY A
[002:27:15;394] LITTLE MORE VULNERABLE
[002:27:16;830] THAN THE SOUTH BAY THIS
[002:27:18;364] TIME, STEVE, RIGHT?
[002:27:19;332] >> RIGHT.
[002:27:19;733] THE STORM RIGHT NOW IS
[002:27:21;334] CENTERED OFF THE NORTHERN
[002:27:22;702] OREGON COAST, AND AT LOWER
[002:27:25;004] ELEVATIONS THE HEAVIEST
[002:27:26;239] RAIN WILL FALL NORTH OF
[002:27:28;407] SAN FRANCISCO AND SKRMT
[002:27:29;943] SACRAMENTO.
[002:27:30;376] THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT
[002:27:32;311] THE SONOMA COUNTY AND
[002:27:34;080] MENDOCINO COUNTY AREAS OF
[002:27:35;615] THE RUSSIAN RIVER BASIN
[002:27:37;150] COULD GET TWO TO THREE
[002:27:38;517] INCHES OF RAIN BY LATE
[002:27:40;319] TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
[002:27:41;587] WE DON'T EXPECT THE RIVERS
[002:27:42;856] TO RISE ABOVE FLOOD STAGE,
[002:27:44;791] BUT WITH THAT RAIN WE'LL
[002:27:46;159] HAVE TO WATCH IT PRETTY
[002:27:47;593] CAREFULLY.
[002:27:47;994] >> OKAY, STEVE, I KNOW YOU
[002:27:49;462] MENTIONED JUST REAL FAST
[002:27:50;764] THAT MUDSLIDES A POSSIBLE
[002:27:52;866] PROBLEM, TOO.
[002:27:53;332] >> RIGHT, THE GROUND IS
[002:27:55;001] SATURATED, OF COURSE, JUST
[002:27:56;369] ABOUT EVERYWHERE IN
[002:27:57;637] CALIFORNIA, AND EVEN JUST
[002:27:58;738] A SHORT PERIOD OF HEAVY
[002:28:00;339] RAIN COULD TRIGGER A FEW
[002:28:02;142] MUDSLIDES ON SLOPES THAT
[002:28:03;877] DIDN'T QUITE GIVE WAY
[002:28:04;944] DURING THE LAST STORM.
[002:28:06;246] >> OKAY.
[002:28:07;180] STEVE FROM THE NATIONAL
[002:28:08;081] WEATHER SERVICE, THANKS
[002:28:09;048] FOR JOINING US.

[002:28:15;288] OVER TOKYO'S SUBWAY SYSTEM
[002:28:15;955] AFTER AN APPARENT
[002:28:16;489] TERRORIST ATTACK
[002:28:16;990] WITH NERVE GAS.
[002:28:18;958] AT LEAST SIX PEOPLE DIED
[002:28:20;093] WHEN TOXIC FUMES SPREAD
[002:28:20;994] THROUGH A HALF DOZEN
[002:28:21;727] SUBWAY TRAINS
[002:28:23;462] DURING THE PEAK OF TOKYO'S
[002:28:24;864] MONDAY MORNING COMMUTE.
[002:28:28;601] THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE
[002:28:29;802] SICK, AS THEY RACED OUT
[002:28:30;936] OF THE SUBWAY STATIONS
[002:28:32;237] IN ONE OF TOKYO'S BUSIEST
[002:28:32;971] DISTRICTS.
[002:28:35;174] MORE THAN 500 OF THEM ARE
[002:28:36;008] IN THE HOSPITAL.

[002:28:39;779] CALLED THE POISONINGS
[002:28:40;946] A RANDOM MASS ATTACK,
[002:28:42;682] BUT ONE SUBWAY MANAGER
[002:28:44;016] SAID SECURITY HAD BEEN
[002:28:45;050] TIGHTENED AT HIS STATION
[002:28:46;084] AFTER RECENT TERRORIST
[002:28:47;052] THREATS.
[002:28:49;622] AT FIRST POLICE THOUGHT
[002:28:50;389] THE SOURCE OF THFUMES
[002:28:51;290] WAS A PAIR OF BOXES
[002:28:52;291] CONTAINING AN INDUSTRIAL
[002:28:54;427] SOLVENT -- METHYL CYANIDE.
[002:28:56;061] EXPOSURE TO IT CAN BE
[002:28:56;929] FATAL.
[002:28:58;230] THE BOXES WERE ON A TRAIN.
[002:28:59;865] BUT OTHER EXPERTS
[002:29:00;833] ON JAPANESE TELEVISION
[002:29:01;900] DOUBTED THAT SO MANY
[002:29:03;402] PEOPLE WOULD BE EFFECTED,
[002:29:04;837] AND POLICE LATER SAID
[002:29:05;805] THEY SUSPECTED A NERVE GAS
[002:29:07;172] CALLED SARIN.
[002:29:08;441] IT WAS INVOLVED
[002:29:09;709] IN A MYSTERIOUS LEAK LAST
[002:29:10;710] YEAR THAT KILLED SEVEN
[002:29:11;610] PEOPLE IN THE TOWN
[002:29:12;745] OF MATSUMOTO.
[002:29:14;279] A MAN WHO PICKED UP A BAG
[002:29:15;280] WITH SOME OF THE SUBSTANCE
[002:29:17;082] IN IT DIED AFTER
[002:29:18;584] HE CARRIED IT TO AN OFFICE
[002:29:19;518] IN THE SUBWAY STATION.
[002:29:21;721] PEOPLE WHO RAN
[002:29:23;155] FROM THE TRAIN SAID THERE
[002:29:24;156] WAS A STRONG SMELL OF GAS.
[002:29:26;191] ONE MAN SAID THE SMELL WAS
[002:29:27;159] ACIDIC.
[002:29:28;794] WITNESSES SAID PEOPLE
[002:29:29;995] BURST FROM THE TRAIN WHEN
[002:29:32;129] IT PULLED INTO TSUKIJI
[002:29:33;064] STATION IN CENTRAL TOKYO.
[002:29:35;066] SOME IMMEDIATELY COLLAPSED
[002:29:35;734] ON THE PLATFORM.
[002:29:37;669] GETTING AROUND IN TOKYO
[002:29:39;103] NOW IS AN EXTRAORDINARY
[002:29:39;838] CHORE.

[002:29:41;740] SHUT DOWN.
[002:29:43;475] 26 STATIONS IN THE CITY
[002:29:44;476] ARE CLOSED.
[002:29:45;543] AT THIS POINT

[002:34:23;551] WE START WITH SOME BACKGROUND.
[002:34:26;354] >> OUR MISSION AS THE NATION'S
[002:34:27;588] OLDEST CONSUMER PROTECTION
[002:34:29;624] AGENCY IS TO PROVIDE BASIC
[002:34:31;692] PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION FOR THE
[002:34:34;028] FOODS WE EAT, FOR THE DRUGS WE
[002:34:35;329] TAKE, AND THE MEDICAL DEVICES WE
[002:34:36;096] USE.
[002:34:44;639] >> IN 1906, A PUBLIC OUTCRY OVER
[002:34:46;274] UNSANITARY CONDITIONS IN THE
[002:34:47;375] MEAT-PACKING INDUSTRY HELPED
[002:34:48;509] SPUR CONGRESS TO PASS THE PURE
[002:34:49;810] FOOD AND DRUG ACT, AND WITH IT,
[002:34:50;844] CREATE THE F.D.A.
[002:34:53;580] IT WAS THE NATION'S FIRST MAJOR
[002:34:54;514] PIECE OF CONSUMER-PROTECTION
[002:34:55;215] LEGISLATION.
[002:34:58;418] TODAY, ALL DRUGS, COSMETICS, AND
[002:34:59;219] MEDICAL DEVICES, AND MOST FOODS,
[002:35:00;220] MUST BE APPROVED BY THE F.D.A.
[002:35:06;226] BEFORE THEY CAN BE MARKETED TO
[002:35:07;061] THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
[002:35:09;029] THE AGENCY'S STANDARDS FOR
[002:35:11;498] APPROVAL ARE THE STRICTEST IN
[002:35:12;232] THE WORLD.
[002:35:13;734] FROM THE OUTSET, THE F.D.A. HAS
[002:35:14;902] BEEN AT THE CENTER OF A NATIONAL
[002:35:16;904] DEBATE OVER HOW FAR THE
[002:35:17;805] GOVERNMENT SHOULD GO TO PROTECT
[002:35:18;572] CONSUMERS.
[002:35:21;041] EVEN ITS DETRACTORS CONCEDE THE
[002:35:23;143] AGENCY HAS HAD SOME MAJOR
[002:35:23;911] SUCCESSES.
[002:35:25;278] IN THE EARLY 1960'S, THE F.D.A.
[002:35:27;881] WAS HONORED FOR SAVING AMERICANS
[002:35:28;648] FROM A TRAGEDY TT
[002:35:29;316] EUROPE.
[002:35:31;351] THE F.D.A. REFUSED TO APPROVE A
[002:35:32;485] DRUG CALLED THALIDOMIDE, A
[002:35:33;553] SEDATIVE THAT WAS WIDELY
[002:35:34;387] PRESCRIBED IN EUROPE.
[002:35:36;289] MANY PREGNANT EUROPEAN WOMEN WHO
[002:35:37;157] USED THE DRUG LATER GAVE BIRTH
[002:35:38;125] TO BABIES WITH SEVERE
[002:35:38;792] DEFORMITIES.
[002:35:41;128] BUT BY THE 1980'S, THE F.D.A.
[002:35:41;862] WAS COMING UNDER CRITICISM FROM
[002:35:42;629] ALL SIDES.
[002:35:49;502] CONSUMER GROUPS SAID THE AGENCY
[002:35:50;270] WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH.
[002:35:52;305] REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AND
[002:35:53;373] BUSINESS CONSERVATIVES SAID THE
[002:35:54;742] F.D.A. WAS STRANGLING THE
[002:35:55;743] DEVELOPMENT OF NEW DRUGS AND
[002:35:56;443] MEDICAL PRODUCTS.
[002:35:59;278] AND ACTIVISTS IN THE AIDS
[002:36:00;379] COMMUNITY RAILED AGAINST THE
[002:36:01;680] F.D.A. FOR MOVING TOO SLOWLY TO
[002:36:02;782] APPROVE ANTI-AIDS DRUGS.
[002:36:06;585] >> WHAT DO WE WANT?
[002:36:07;153] >> A CURE FOR AIDS!
[002:36:07;854] >> WHEN DO WE WANT IT?
[002:36:08;654] >> NOW!
[002:36:10;556] >> THEN, IN 1991, PRESIDENT BUSH
[002:36:11;624] APPOINTED DAVID KESSLER AS
[002:36:12;291] F.D.A. COMMISSIONER.
[002:36:15;261] KESSLER VOWED TO BRING TOUGH
[002:36:16;996] ENFORCEMENT TO HEALTH AND SAFETY
[002:36:18;631] LAWS, BUT HE ALSO PROMISED TO
[002:36:20;499] SPEED UP THE F.D.A.'S SLOW AND
[002:36:21;667] BUREAUCRATIC APPROVAL PROCESS.
[002:36:25;271] KESSLER MADE FOOD-MAKERS BE MORE
[002:36:26;639] SPECIFIC AND PUT ACCURATE
[002:36:28;440] INFORMATION ON THEIR PACKAGE
[002:36:29;708] LABELS, AND HE CRACKED DOWN ON
[002:36:30;509] THE MISUSE OF TERMS LIKE "FRESH"
[002:36:31;277] AND OW-FAT."
[002:36:35;114] >> CONSUMERS WANT AND THEY
[002:36:36;883] DESERVE MORE ACCURATE AND USEFUL
[002:36:38;217] INFORMATION WHICH WILL ALLOW
[002:36:39;685] THEM TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES.
[002:36:47;326] >> IN 1992, KESSLER DECLARED A
[002:36:48;227] MORATORIUM ON SILICONE BREAST
[002:36:49;295] IMPLANTS, CITING THE DANGERS
[002:36:50;429] FROM LEAKAGE AND INFECTION.
[002:36:55;201] HE TOOK THE ACTION EVEN THOUGH
[002:36:56;402] HE WAS TORN BETWEEN THE RISK AND
[002:36:57;469] THE BENEFIT TO THE WOMEN USING
[002:36:58;237] THEM.
[002:37:01;908] >> THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE TO THE
[002:37:02;909] EQUATION, AND THAT MAKES OUR
[002:37:03;609] TASK EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT.
[002:37:08;814] BREAST IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN USED
[002:37:10;548] FOR THREE DECADES, AND MANY
[002:37:11;416] PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS ARE
[002:37:12;117] CONVINCED OF THEIR VALUE.
[002:37:18;890] A NUMBER OF WOMEN HAVE
[002:37:19;791] PERSONALLY TOLD ME WHAT A
[002:37:21;092] DIFFERENCE THESE DEVICES HAVE
[002:37:21;827] MADE IN THEIR OWN LIVES.
[002:37:24;462] >> KESSLER ALSO FULFILLED HIS
[002:37:25;663] PROMISE TO SPEED UP F.D.A. DRUG
[002:37:26;798] APPROVAL, REDUCING THE TIME BY
[002:37:27;565] SEVERAL MONTHS.
[002:37:30;535] HE EVEN DEVELOPED A SPECIAL
[002:37:32;137] FAST-TRACK APPROVAL PROCESS FOR
[002:37:32;904] LIFE-SAVING DRUGS.
[002:37:36;041] MANY OUTSIDE OBSERVERS CREDIT
[002:37:37;008] KESSLER FOR STRIKING A DIFFICULT
[002:37:37;775] BALANCE.
[002:37:40;712] PHILIP HILTS COVERS THE AGENCY
[002:37:41;446] FOR THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
[002:37:43;815] >> KESSLER IS A LAWYER AND A
[002:37:45;083] PEDIATRICIAN AT THE SAME TIME.
[002:37:47;685] HE HAS TAUGHT F.D.A. LAW, AND SO
[002:37:48;453] HIS FOCUS WAS ON STRICT F.D.A.
[002:37:49;187] LAW.
[002:37:55;460] AND AT THE SAME TIME, HE WANTED
[002:37:56;228] TO DO THE OTHER THING.
[002:37:56;895] HE WANTED TO MOVE THINGS ALONG
[002:37:57;662] FOR INDUSTRY.
[002:37:59;497] SO AT THE ONE TIME HE'S GETTING
[002:38:00;565] STRICT; AT THE SAME TIME, HE'S
[002:38:01;299] MOVING DRUGS FASTER.
[002:38:06;071] NOW COMES THE NEW CONGRESS IN
[002:38:06;804] WHICH THEY DON'T LIKE REGULATION
[002:38:07;572] AT ALL.
[002:38:10;675] CRITICS IN THE NEW CONGRESS IS
[002:38:11;409] HOUSE SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH.
[002:38:13;578] GINGRICH IS CALLING FOR MAJOR,
[002:38:15;379] THOUGH AS YET UNSPECIFIED,
[002:38:16;546] CHANGES IN THE AGENCY.
[002:38:19;416] THE SPEAKER HAS CALLED THE
[002:38:21;651] AGENCY THE NATION'S "LEADING
[002:38:22;853] JOB-KILLER," AND HAS DESCRIBED
[002:38:24;688] KESSLER HIMSELF AS A "THUG" AND
[002:38:26;423] A "BULLY."
[002:38:27;591] MOST RECENTLY, GINGRICH USED AN
[002:38:28;859] EXPERIMENTAL MEDICAL DEVICE
[002:38:29;726] CALLED A CARDIOPUMP TO MAKE HIS
[002:38:30;494] POINT.
[002:38:33;998] >> THIS INCREASES BY 54% THE
[002:38:35;665] NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH C.P.R. WHO
[002:38:37;801] GET TO THE HOSPITAL AND HAVE A
[002:38:38;936] CHANCE TO RECOVER.
[002:38:41;171] IT IS ILLEGAL IN THE UNITED
[002:38:43;607] STATES BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET A
[002:38:45;509] TEST ON A PERSON WHO HAS A HEART
[002:38:46;543] ATTACK BECAUSE THEY'RE
[002:38:47;544] UNCONSCIOUS, SO YOU CAN'T GET
[002:38:48;279] INFORMED CONSENT.
[002:38:49;914] SO THE F.D.A., THE FOOD AND DRUG
[002:38:51;181] ADMINISTRATION, MAKES ILLEGAL A
[002:38:52;349] PRODUCT USED IN 11 COUNTRIES
[002:38:53;417] THAT MINIMIZES BRAIN DAMAGE,
[002:38:55;019] THAT INCREASES THE SPEED OF
[002:38:55;920] RECOVERY, SAVES MONEY.
[002:38:58;622] THIS COSTS $200.
[002:39:00;991] >> THE F.D.A. POINTS OUT THE
[002:39:02;359] DANISH COMPANY THAT MAKES THE
[002:39:03;894] CARDIOPUMP HASN'T EVEN APPLIED
[002:39:05;162] FOR F.D.A. APPROVAL.
[002:39:07;998] YET EVEN COMPANIES THAT ARE
[002:39:09;400] DEMANDING FURTHER CHANGES AT THE
[002:39:10;801] AGENCY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY'VE
[002:39:12;269] BENEFITTED FROM THE F.D.A.
[002:39:13;804] PROCESS, SAYS PHILIP HILTS OF
[002:39:14;504] THE "NEW YORK TIMES."
[002:39:17;441] >> THAT IS WHERE THE CREDIBILITY
[002:39:18;508] OF THE AMERICAN INDUSTRY COMES
[002:39:19;876] FROM, IS THE FACT THAT THE
[002:39:21;545] F.D.A. HAS MADE THEM DO IT
[002:39:22;746] RIGHT, MADE THEM BE QUITE SAFE
[002:39:23;480] COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES.
[002:39:26;417] SO THIS IS A REPUTATION THAT
[002:39:27;250] THEY CARE ABOUT, BUT THEY STILL
[002:39:28;051] WANT REFORM OF SOME KIND.
[002:39:34;758] >> AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING
[002:39:36;726] TODAY, DR. KESSLER DEFENDED THE
[002:39:37;894] F.D.A. AGAINST CLAIMS THAT IT IS
[002:39:39;028] HOSTILE TO THE INDUSTRIES IT
[002:39:39;729] REGULATES.
[002:39:41;765] >> THE NUMBER ONE CRITICISM IS
[002:39:42;933] THAT F.D.A. IS ANTAGONISTIC
[002:39:43;633] RATHER THAN CONCILIATORY.
[002:39:47;437] WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THEM, YOU
[002:39:48;271] DON'T HAVE A CAN-DO ATTITUDE;
[002:39:50;507] YOU HAVE A CAN'T-DO ATTITUDE
[002:39:51;942] TOWARDS THE DRUG COMPANY OR THE
[002:39:53;810] MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURE OR
[002:39:55;178] SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
[002:39:58;582] >> YOU DON'T THINK, CONGRESSMAN,
[002:39:59;916] THAT I WANT TO GET A DEVICE
[002:40:01;184] THAT'S GOING TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S
[002:40:02;619] LIVES OUT THERE AS SOON AS
[002:40:03;286] POSSIBLE?
[002:40:05;956] YOU DON'T THINK THAT THE
[002:40:07;223] PEOPLE... I MEAN, WHO DO YOU
[002:40:07;924] THINK COME WORK AT F.D.A.?
[002:40:12;095] I MEAN, THEY'RE PHYSICIANS WHO
[002:40:13;630] TAKE CARE OF REAL PATIENTS, HAVE
[002:40:14;397] LOST REAL PATIENTS.
[002:40:18;368] >> POSSIBLY THE BUREAUCRATS AT
[002:40:19;469] F.D.A. HAVE GOTTEN LOST IN THE
[002:40:21;104] RULES AND REGULATIONS RATHER
[002:40:22;506] THAN THE SPIRIT OF "HEY, YOU
[002:40:23;940] KNOW, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW ALL
[002:40:24;674] THE ANSWERS OUT HERE."
[002:40:28;845] >> I KNOW IT'S NOT POLITICALLY
[002:40:32;415] CORRECT TO SAY THIS THESE DAYS,
[002:40:33;416] BUT I AM AND THE AGENCY IS A
[002:40:34;484] REGULATORY AGENCY.
[002:40:37;387] IT'S NOT IN FASHION, BUT THERE
[002:40:38;687] ARE TIMES WHEN YOU'RE A
[002:40:39;889] RELATORY AGENCY THAT YOU HAVE
[002:40:41;557] TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR
[002:40:43;826] OBJECTIVITY INTACT.S
[002:40:50;766] >> BUT IN THIS NEW REPUBLICAN
[002:40:52;135] CONGRESS, PRESSURE ON THE F.D.A.
[002:40:52;902] ISN'T EXPECTED TO LET UP ANY
[002:40:53;602] TIME SOON.
[002:40:57;706] >> WE HEAR TWO VIEWS ON HOW GOOD
[002:40:58;607] A JOB THE F.D.A. IS DOING UNDER
[002:40:59;375] DAVID KESSLER.
[002:41:00;143] CONGRESSMAN JOE BARTON,
[002:41:01;010] REPUBLICAN OF TEXAS, IS THE
[002:41:02;011] CHAIRMAN OF THE OVERSIGHT
[002:41:02;845] SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE HOUSE
[002:41:03;513] COMMERCE COMMITTEE.
[002:41:06;182] HIS SUBCOMMITTEE WILL BEGIN
[002:41:08;518] THE DEFENSE'S DNA EXPERT
[002:41:09;419] WHO HAS A HISTORY
[002:41:10;753] OF USING LSD.
[002:41:16;192] >> MR. SHECK EXPRESSED
[002:41:20;129] CONCERN THAT A NOBEL
[002:41:21;164] PRIZE WINNER LIKE
[002:41:26;369] DR. MOLLIS WOULD HAVE
[002:41:29;205] TO ANSWER PERSONAL
[002:41:29;738] QUESTIONS.
[002:41:33;209] LAST TIME I LOOKED IN THE
[002:41:34;544] CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE,
[002:41:36;145] WE DIDN'T HAVE EXCEPTIONS
[002:41:36;946] FOR NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS.
[002:41:39;515] >> EARLIER BEFORE
[002:41:41;784] PROSECUTORS CALLED A
[002:41:43;252] SECURITY COMPANY WHO
[002:41:44;619] CLAIMED SIMPSON COULD NOT
[002:41:45;487] HAVE ENTERED HIS HOUSE
[002:41:47;089] THROUGH THE GARAGE
[002:41:48;290] WITHOUT SETTING OFF
[002:41:49;458] ALARMS.
[002:41:49;824] THE PROSECUTION IS HOPING
[002:41:51;293] TO SHOW THAT'S HOW HE
[002:41:52;561] DROPPED THE BLOODY GLOVE,
[002:41:54;362] WHILE SEARCHING THE
[002:41:54;929] PROPERTY.
[002:41:56;431] THE BATTLE, BUT ADMIT
[002:41:57;532] THE WAR ISN'T OVER YET.
[002:41:58;567] NEWSCENTER 4'S LINDA YEE
[002:41:59;201] EXPLAINS.
[002:42:02;571] >> THE RULING CAME AFTER
[002:42:03;671] SIX HOMOSEXUAL MILITARY
[002:42:04;573] SERVICE MEMBERS
[002:42:06;141] CHALLENGED THE CLINTON
[002:42:07;309] ADMINISTRATION'S "DON'T
[002:42:08;443] ASK, DON'T TELL" POLICY.
[002:42:09;777] A POLICY PASSED
[002:42:12;514] BY CONGRESS IN 1993 THAT
[002:42:13;548] ALLOWS GAY MEN AND WOMEN
[002:42:14;483] TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY
[002:42:16;017] AS LONG AS THEIR SEXUAL
[002:42:17;685] ORIENTATION IS KEPT
[002:42:18;253] A SECRET.
[002:42:19;554] A U.S. DISTRICT COURT
[002:42:20;788] JUDGE IN NEW YORK SAID IT
[002:42:21;789] WAS A VIOLATION
[002:42:22;890] OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S
[002:42:23;992] GUARANTEE OF FREEDOM
[002:42:24;559] OF SPEECH.
[002:42:25;994] AND "DON'T ASK, DON'T
[002:42:27;629] TELL" ONLY ENCOURAGES
[002:42:28;730] HOMOSEXUALS TO LIE.
[002:42:30;865] LAWYERS REPRESENTING
[002:42:31;899] THE SIX GAY MILITARY
[002:42:32;734] MEMBERS SAID THE COURTS
[002:42:33;735] EXPOSED THE POLICY
[002:42:34;736] FOR WHAT IT REALLY WAS.
[002:42:36;738] >> WHAT HE SAID, I THINK,
[002:42:38;439] THE FIRST AMENDMENT SAYS
[002:42:42;143] TO THE FEDERAL
[002:42:42;777] GOVERNMENT,
[002:42:43;945] YOU CAN'T GAG ONE GROUP
[002:42:44;578] OF CITIZENS BECAUSE
[002:42:45;146] ANOTHER GROUP OF CITIZENS
[002:42:45;813] DOESN'T LIKE WHAT THEY'RE
[002:42:46;480] SAYING.
[002:42:46;848] >> ZOE DUNNING, AN OPENLY
[002:42:47;715] GAY NAVY RESERVE
[002:42:48;616] LIEUTENANT COMNDER,
[002:42:50;118] RECENTLY WON HER OWN CASE
[002:42:50;952] TO KEEP SERVING
[002:42:52;486] IN THE MILITARY BEFORE
[002:42:53;554] "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL"
[002:42:54;221] BECAME POLICY.
[002:42:55;923] BUT SHE SAYS THE RULING
[002:42:57;025] TODAY IS IMPORTANT.
[002:42:59;393] >> HOMOSEXUALS JUST WANT
[002:43:00;261] TO LIVE THEIR LIVES
[002:43:01;162] HONESTLY WITHOUT HAVING
[002:43:02;496] TO EDIT EVERYTHING
[002:43:03;230] THEY SAY AND DO.
[002:43:04;899] >> AN ESTIMATED 200 GAY
[002:43:05;867] SERVICE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN
[002:43:06;734] DISCHARGED UNDER
[002:43:08;002] THE POLICY OR ARE
[002:43:08;602] AWAITING DECISIONS.
[002:43:09;837] THE CLINTON
[002:43:10;772] ADMINISTRATION INSISTS
[002:43:11;839] THE POLICY IS WORKING,
[002:43:13;440] AND DISPUTES THE JUDGE'S
[002:43:14;341] RULING THAT IT IS
[002:43:15;043] UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
[002:43:16;644] THE RULING ONLY AFFECTS
[002:43:17;745] THE SIX GAY MILITARY
[002:43:18;813] MEMBERS WHO CHALLENGED
[002:43:20;381] THE POLICY AND DOESN'T
[002:43:21;348] MEAN OTHER GAYS
[002:43:22;416] IN THE MILITARY SHOULD
[002:43:23;084] COME OUT OF THE CLOSET.
[002:43:25;286] GAY ADVOCATES SAY IT
[002:43:26;720] SENDS A MESSAGE AND IS
[002:43:27;321] THE FIRST STEP
[002:43:28;189] IN DISMANTLING THE "DON'T
[002:43:29;290] ASK, DON'T TELL" POLICY.
[002:43:30;824] THE GOVERNMENT IS
[002:43:31;659] EXPECTED TO APPEAL.
[002:43:33;927] IN SAN FRANCISCO, LINDA
[002:43:35;229] YEE, NEWSCENTER 4.
[002:43:37;198] >> BOTH SIDES EXPECT
[002:43:37;964] THE CASE WILL EVENTUALLY
[002:43:39;433] BE SETTLED BY THE U.S.

[002:43:44;037] AND CONTRADICTION AMONG
[002:43:44;672] AMERICANS.
[002:43:45;772] A NEW NATIONWIDE POLL
[002:43:46;607] BY "THE L.A. TIMES" SHOWS
[002:43:48;309] THAT 70% OF THOSE
[002:43:49;376] SURVEYED BELIEVE RACIAL
[002:43:50;077] PREJUDICE IN THE
[002:43:51;645] WORKPLACE STILL EXISTS.
[002:43:52;479] HOWEVER, JUST 22%
[002:43:53;814] SUPPORTED AFFIRMATIVE
[002:43:55;048] ACTION POLICIES AS A WAY
[002:43:56;250] OF CORRECTING INEQUITIES
[002:43:57;351] ON THE JOB FOR WOMEN
[002:43:58;018] AND MINORITIES.
[002:44:00;120] "THE TIMES" CONDUCTED
[002:44:00;821] RANDOM TEL
[002:44:01;788] >> I'M BELVA DAVIS.
[002:44:03;557] I WILL HAVE THE STORYTHE SUY
[002:44:05;392] IN DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO,
[002:44:08;061] AND IT WASN'T JUST
[002:44:08;662] PROTEST.
[002:44:10;331] HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS
[002:44:11;432] OF THE CANNABIS BUYERS
[002:44:12;966] CLUB MARCHED FROM
[002:44:14;101] THE FEDERAL BUILDING
[002:44:14;735] TO CITY HALL TODAY.
[002:44:15;436] THEY WERE PROTESTING
[002:44:16;370] THE ILLEGALITY OF USING
[002:44:17;070] MARIJUANA FOR MEDICAL
[002:44:17;738] PURPOSES.
[002:44:19;540] THOUSANDS OF AIDS
[002:44:20;541] AND CANCER PATIENTS USE
[002:44:21;508] POT FOR PAIN RELIEF.
[002:44:24;010] THE CLUB ILLEGALLY
[002:44:24;878] SUPPLIES SOME OF THOSE
[002:44:25;578] PATIENTS WITH CANNABIS
[002:44:27;113] AND SAYS IT SHOULD BE
[002:44:27;780] PERMITTED TO DO
[002:44:28;414] SO WITHOUT HARASSMENT
[002:44:29;349] FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITIES.PRN
[002:44:30;683] A LOT OF PEOPLE TIME
[002:44:31;484] TO SPECULATE ABOUT
[002:44:35;555] UNTIL WE SEE THE RUMORS ON
[002:44:36;689] THE OUTSIDE.
[002:44:38;424] FROM THE LEGAL CIRCLES
[002:44:39;292] THAT YOU ARE AROUND, DO
[002:44:40;326] YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS IS
[002:44:41;327] GOING TO ENTER INTO THE
[002:44:42;194] TRIAL?
[002:44:42;862] >> NO.
[002:44:44;297] I DON'T.
[002:44:44;664] I THINK THAT THERE HAVE
[002:44:46;031] BEEN RUMORS ABOUT DRUG USE
[002:44:47;634] FOR MANY MONTHS NOW, AND I
[002:44:49;168] DON'T THINK THAT SOMEONE
[002:44:50;536] COMING FORWARD AND SAYING
[002:44:52;472] THAT O.J. SIMPSON HAD DONE
[002:44:53;539] DRUGS ON A PARTICULAR
[002:44:54;540] OCCASION IS GOING TO
[002:44:55;642] EFFECT THIS TRIAL, I DON'T
[002:44:57;410] THINK IT WILL COME INTO
[002:44:58;378] THE TRIAL.
[002:44:59;479] IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT
[002:45:00;780] FOR THE PROSECUTION TO GET
[002:45:01;581] IN WHAT'S CALLED PAST BAD
[002:45:03;383] ACTS, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY
[002:45:05;652] WHAT COCAINE USE IS.
[002:45:06;619] IF THEY WANTED TO SAY IT'S
[002:45:07;987] PART OF THEIR THEORY OF
[002:45:10;089] EXACTLY HOW THE MURDER WAS
[002:45:10;856] COMMITTED, IF THEY HAVE A
[002:45:11;724] WITNESS WHO WOULD COME
[002:45:12;925] FORWARD AND SAY THAT NIGHT
[002:45:15;361] THAT DRUG USE OCCURRED,
[002:45:17;062] THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT.
[002:45:18;197] BUT AGAIN, PROSECUTORS
[002:45:19;565] STILL PROBABLY WOULDN'T
[002:45:20;400] USE IT.
[002:45:20;966] >> ALL RIGHT, DAN ABRAMS,
[002:45:22;769] REPORTING LIVE FROM LOS
[002:45:23;736] ANGELES.
[002:45:24;103] HE IS A REPORTING WITH
[002:45:25;137] COURT TV.
[002:45:26;606] >> TOMORROW, CRIMINALIST
[002:45:28;608] BUT SELDOM DO THEY VENTURE
[002:45:30;310] INTO POLITICS, CERTAINLY
[002:45:31;310] NOT A HOT POLITICAL ISSUE
[002:45:32;043] LIKE ABORTION.
[002:45:34;446] BUT TODAY THEY HAD COME
[002:45:35;146] TO SUPPORT A FRIEND
[002:45:36;381] BY LISTENING TO THE HEAD
[002:45:37;081] OF THE NATIONAL ABORTION
[002:45:38;049] AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHT
[002:45:38;717] LEAGUE.
[002:45:39;818] >> AFTER A QUARTER
[002:45:41;986] OF A CENTURY OF PRO-CHOICE
[002:45:43;789] ADVOCACY, AFTER ALL THIS
[002:45:44;690] TIME AND ALL THE BATTLES,
[002:45:46;591] THE THREATS ARE EVERMORE
[002:45:47;826] SINISTER TODAY.
[002:45:49;894] >> IN THE AUDIENCE, WOMEN
[002:45:50;829] WHOSE FAMILY NAMES
[002:45:52;096] AND BUSINESSES REPRESENT
[002:45:53;865] POWER AND MONEY, LIKE
[002:45:55;367] ORGANIZER DAGMAR DOLBY,
[002:45:56;635] DOLBY SOUND.
[002:45:58;203] SALLY JORDAN, JORDAN

[002:46:10;248] THE BANKING FAMILY.
[002:46:10;982] ON THE SPONSOR LIST, NAMES
[002:46:11;717] LIKE DOUBLEDAY, LURI,
[002:46:12;384] SCHWAB, SWIG, AND KAISER.
[002:46:13;117] DAGMAR DOLBY ACKNOWLEDGE
[002:46:14;586] THAT THIS IS NEW TURF
[002:46:15;354] FOR HER AND MANY
[002:46:15;920] OF HER FRIENDS.
[002:46:19;858] >> IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT
[002:46:21;192] POLITICS IS PART OF THIS.
[002:46:22;494] I AM NOT REALLY
[002:46:24;396] A POLITICAL PERSON
[002:46:25;230] AND I DON'T HAVE A LOT
[002:46:25;897] OF EXPERIENCE
[002:46:26;431] WITH POLITICAL ACTIVISM.
[002:46:27;131] >> BUT SHE FEELS SO STRONG
[002:46:28;099] ABOUT CHOICE, SHE CAJOLED,
[002:46:29;033] PERSUADED, AND FOUND SOME
[002:46:30;068] SUPPORT AMONG HER FRIENDS
[002:46:30;869] TO TAKE PART IN THE FORUM.
[002:46:32;838] >> AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
[002:46:34;906] YOU CANNOT HAVE FAMILY
[002:46:36;375] VALUES IF YOU HAVE
[002:46:36;975] UNWANTED CHILDREN.
[002:46:38;309] >> A SURPRISING
[002:46:39;043] BENEFICIARY OF THIS
[002:46:40;412] POLITICAL ACTIVISM AMONG
[002:46:41;412] THE SOCIALLY PROMINENT
[002:46:42;546] MIGHT BE GOVERNOR PETE
[002:46:44;282] WILSON AS HE LOOKS TOWARD
[002:46:45;016] A NATIONAL RACE .
[002:46:47;118] >> I'VE ASKED PEOPLE
[002:46:48;987] TO SUPPORT PEOPLE LIKE
[002:46:50;788] GOVERNOR PETE WILSON WHO
[002:46:52;023] HAVE STOOD FIRM
[002:46:55;493] ON HIS SUPPORT
[002:46:56;361] FOR THE WOMEN'S FREEDOM
[002:46:57;061] TO CHOOSE.
[002:46:58;696] >> AT A LUNCHEON THAT
[002:47:00;564] FOLLOWED, THE POINT WAS
[002:47:01;266] MADE THAT MANY
[002:47:02;100] OF ATTENDEES RAISE
[002:47:03;067] THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
[002:47:04;335] FOR VARIOUS NON-PROFITS,
[002:47:05;436] BUT SELDOM HAVE
[002:47:06;704] THEY FOCUSED ON AN ISSUE
[002:47:08;039] THAT IS SURE TO BE A HOT
[002:47:08;973] ISSUE DURING THE COMING
[002:47:09;941] ELECTION SEASON.
[002:47:12;710] >> THESE WOMEN COLDN'T
[002:47:13;611] HAVE CHOSEN AN ISSUE WHERE
[002:47:14;345] THE DEBATE IS MORE
[002:47:15;513] INTENSE, WITH TREMENDOUS
[002:47:16;281] PASSION ON BOTH SIDES.
[002:47:18;883] AS TO WHAT'S NEXT,
[002:47:19;817] THEY ARE STILL TRYING
[002:47:20;484] TO DECIDE.
[002:47:22;686] THE PROMISE WAS TO GATHER
[002:47:23;587] INFORMATION AND STAY
[002:47:27;058] INFORMED.
[002:47:27;458] BUT FOR GOVERNOR
[002:47:28;893] PETE WILSON THEIR
[002:47:29;827] POLITICAL AWAKENING
[002:47:30;461] COULDN'T HAVE COME
[002:47:34;498] AT A BETTER TIME, AS EE
[002:47:37;001] STARTS TO GATHER FINANCIAL
[002:47:38;269] SUPPORT FOR A POSSIBLE
[002:47:39;804] PRESIDENTIAL BID.
[002:47:40;338] >> WHEN WE RETURN,
[002:47:41;940] MR. INVOLVEMENT IS GOING
[002:47:42;573] TO BE A COACH. "IN
[002:47:44;742] THIS STATE" TJ78F0
[002:47:47;478] IS TAKE CONTROL OF TERRITORIES,h
[002:47:49;179] SO ANYONE WHO CONTROLS TERRITORY
[002:47:52;115] MAKES MONEY.
[002:47:54;852] WE HAVE HAD DIFFERENT ETHNIC
[002:47:58;288] GROUPS BATTLE FOR TERRITORY TO
[002:47:59;356] EARN MONEY FROM THE ILLICIT DRUG
[002:48:00;257] TRANSIT TRADE.
[002:48:05;563] WE ARE TAKING MONEY FOR
[002:48:08;398] SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND
[002:48:09;633] ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION.
[002:48:12;169] THE TROUBLE THAT WE'VE HAD IS
[002:48:13;070] THAT AS WE ARREST NARCOTIC
[002:48:14;304] SMUGGLING, THEY REACT WHERE THEY
[002:48:15;639] HAVE THEIR BASE, AND THEIR BASE
[002:48:17;374] IS IN PRECINCTS OF KARACHI.
[002:48:20;778] WE HAVE A CHOICE OF EITHER
[002:48:22;412] GIVING IN TO THEM AND PERMITTING
[002:48:27;518] THIS TREND TO CONTINUE, OR WE
[002:48:30;187] HAVE A CHOICE OF SAYING CRIME
[002:48:34;224] DOESN'T PAY, DRUG TRADE DOES NOT
[002:48:35;559] PAY.
[002:48:38;963] THAT'S THE OPTION WE HAVE
[002:48:39;797] CHOSEN.
[002:48:43;400] THE LAW AND ORDER HAS IMPROVED
[002:48:46;537] SINCE I BECAME PRIME MINISTER.
[002:48:48;639] I'VE WITHDRAWN THE ARMY.
[002:48:53;276] IT IS THE CIVIL POLICE WHO ARE
[002:48:54;678] LOOKING AFTER MATTERS, AND IN
[002:48:57;347] THESE 20 POLICE STATIONS OUT OF
[002:48:59;717] 80 WHERE THERE IS TROUBLE, WE
[002:49:00;851] ARE MOVING IN A VERY FIRM WAY.
[002:49:02;819] I EXPECT THE RESULTS TO SHOW
[002:49:03;820] IN... I DON'T EXPECT OVERNIGHT
[002:49:05;154] RESULTS; THE PROBLEM DIDN'T GROW
[002:49:06;155] OVERNIGHT.
[002:49:11;961] BUT I EXPECT IN ONE OR TWO YEARS
[002:49:13;029] FOR THE PROBLEM TO SETTLE DOWN
[002:49:13;763] IN ALL OF KARACHI.
[002:49:15;064] >> LATE LAST MONTH YOU ASKED FOR
[002:49:15;865] UNITED STATES HELP IN CLEANING
[002:49:16;799] OUT TERRORIST CAMPS IN NORTHWEST
[002:49:17;567] PAKISTAN.
[002:49:19;201] WHAT KIND OF HELP DID YOU MEAN?
[002:49:24;741] >> I REALLY TALKED ABOUT SUPPORT
[002:49:25;842] BECAUSE WE HAD COME UNDER
[002:49:26;509] CRITICISM THAT THERE ARE THESE
[002:49:27;243] CAMPS IN PAKISTAN.
[002:49:31;414] I SAID INSTEAD OF CRITICISM, WE
[002:49:32;882] NEED SUPPORT, BECAUSE WHAT WE
[002:49:34;283] ARE DOING IS IN DEFENSE OF
[002:49:35;284] GLOBAL VALUES IN COMBATING
[002:49:36;318] TERRORISM.
[002:49:39;022] BUT IN TERMS OF CONCRETE
[002:49:40;356] ASSISTANCE, I THINK WE DO NEED
[002:49:41;624] INTELLIGENCE SHARING, AND WE
[002:49:42;992] NEED TO SET UP A PROPER DATA
[002:49:44;393] BANK AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL IN
[002:49:46;629] PAKISTAN WHICH DOES NOT EXIST TO
[002:49:48;064] DATE, BECAUSE LAW AND ORDER HAD
[002:49:49;699] BEEN LOOKED AFTER BY THE
[002:49:51;434] PROVINCES OR STATES.
[002:49:54;604] IN TANGIBLE WAYS, HIGH-TECH
[002:49:55;772] TRAINING AND INFILTRATION AND
[002:49:57;206] DETECTION, ANTI-BOMB MEASURES--
[002:50:03;412] THESE ARE THE THINGS WE NEED TO
[002:50:06;816] LEARN ABOUT.
[002:50:10;352] BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, WE
[002:50:13;255] WANT MORAL SUPPORT.
[002:50:14;390] WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR MARINES TO
[002:50:16;258] COME AND CLEAN UP THE CAMPS, BUT
[002:50:17;960] WE ARE SAYING WE NEED YOUR MORAL
[002:50:19;395] SUPPORT IN WHAT WE ARE DOING,
[002:50:20;896] BECAUSE THIS IS NOT JUST OUR
[002:50:21;830] BATTLE.
[002:50:23;132] IT IS BATTLE FOR STABILITY IN
[002:50:24;032] THE MUSLIM WORLD AND A BATTLE
[002:50:25;167] FOR STABILITY IN THE WORLD AT
[002:50:26;202] LARGE, AND, YES, IF IN TECHNICAL
[002:50:27;169] WAYS LIKE SETTING UP A DATA
[002:50:28;204] SYSTEM AND TECHNICAL SHARING, IF
[002:50:29;505] WE CAN WORK TOGETHER, THAT WOULD
[002:50:30;439] BE GOOD.
[002:50:33;609] >> TURNING NOW TO YOUR VISIT TO
[002:50:36;178] THE UNITED STATES, WHAT HAS BEEN
[002:50:37;813] YOUR MAIN MESSAGE TO MEMBERS OF
[002:50:39;047] CONGRESS LAST WEEK?
[002:50:40;616] AND YOU'RE SEEING THE PRESIDENT
[002:50:42;050] TOMORROW.
[002:50:44;386] WHAT WILL YOU BE TELLING HIM?
[002:50:46;322] >> I'M HERE TO THAW THE
[002:50:47;456] RELATIONS THAT HAVE REMAINED
[002:50:48;457] FROZEN SINCE 1990 IN OUR
[002:50:50;259] COUNTRIES, AND I AM HERE TO
[002:50:51;994] BUILD A NEW RELATIONSHIP IN THE
[002:50:52;761] POST-COLD WAR ERA.
[002:50:54;563] WE MAY HAVE CONTAINED
[002:50:57;099] COMMUNISM, BUT PAKISTAN IS STILL
[002:50:58;501] IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS THE
[002:51:00;369] ACCESS TO CENTRAL ASIA, THE GULF
[002:51:02;371] AND SOUTH ASIA, TO THE MARKETS
[002:51:04;406] OF THESE REGIONS, AND THAT
[002:51:06;308] PAKISTAN AND CORPORATE AMERICA
[002:51:10;679] HAVE AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP.
[002:51:13;149] THE POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP
[002:51:14;049] SHOULD REFCT THE IMPORTANCE OF
[002:51:15;184] OUR CORPORATE RELATIONSHIP.
[002:51:19;588] I'M ALSO HERE TO SAY THAT WE
[002:51:20;789] SHARE THE UNITED STATES' VIEWS
[002:51:22;024] ON NONPROLIFERATION, BUT THAT WE
[002:51:23;859] BELIEVE THAT SANCTIONS ON
[002:51:25;361] PAKISTAN HAVE NOT HELPED THE
[002:51:26;928] PROCESS OF NONPROLIFERATION, AND
[002:51:29;230] THAT THE UNITED STATES WITH
[002:51:30;766] PAKISTAN SHOULD SEE WHAT IS A
[002:51:33;068] BETTER WAY TO WORK FOR
[002:51:36;271] NONPROLIFERATION OF THE WEAPONS
[002:51:39;708] OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN SOUTH
[002:51:41;242] ASIA.
[002:51:45;013] WE HAVE PROPOSED A ZERO-MISSILE
[002:51:47;149] REGIME IN PAKISTAN, A NUCLEAR-
[002:51:48;550] FREE ASIA BY PAKISTAN, BUT THE
[002:51:50;552] MEASURES HAVE NOT BEEN ACCEPTED
[002:51:52;054] BY OUR NEIGHBORS BECAUSE THERE
[002:51:53;588] ARE SANCTIONS ON PAKISTAN, SO NO
[002:51:55;190] INCENTIVES FOR THEM.
[002:52:01;096] I'M ALSO HERE TO SAY THAT WE HAD
[002:52:02;597] AN HONORABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH
[002:52:05;400] THE UNITED STATES, AND WE EXPECT
[002:52:06;334] HONOR TO GUIDE OUR RELATIONS IND
[002:52:08;536] THE FUTURE.
[002:52:13;408] THERE IS $1.4 BILLION THAT WE
[002:52:18;080] CONTRACTED FOR BEFORE SANCTIONS
[002:52:20;015] FOR THE EQUIPMENT.
[002:52:23;218] WE WOULD RATHER HAVE THE
[002:52:24;152] EQUIPMENT MADE BY PBAMERICAN
[002:52:25;220] WORKERS, BUT IF AMERICA CANNOT
[002:52:26;154] GIVE US THE EQUIPMENT, WE WOULD
[002:52:26;922] LIKE OUR MONEY BACK.
[002:52:28;790] >> WOULD YOU USE THAT MONEY THEN
[002:52:29;725] TO BUY COMPARABLE PLANES FROM
[002:52:30;525] OTHER COUNTRIES, SAY, FRANCE OR
[002:52:31;292] RUSSIA?
[002:52:33;294] >> WE'VE ALREADY BUDGETED FOR
[002:52:34;162] BUYING PLANES FOR OUR DEFENSE
[002:52:35;563] FROM OTHER NATIONS, AND TO BUY
[002:52:37;032] OTHER EQUIPMENT, TOO, BECAUSE
[002:52:37;999] UNTIL THE DISPUTE IS RESOLVED,
[002:52:38;799] SECURITY WILL REMAIN A MAIN
[002:52:40;101] ISSUIN EXTREMIS.
[002:52:42;169] I MEAN, IT'S NOT VERY VIABLE
[002:52:43;871] RIGHT NOW.
[002:52:45;539] >> Reporter: FIRST,
[002:52:46;841] DR. FOSTER WAS CHALLENGED
[002:52:47;842] BY ANTI-ABORTION ADVOCATES,
[002:52:48;976] WHO OBJECTED TO
[002:52:50;044] HIS OBSTETRICS BACKGROUND.
[002:52:52;012] BUT THE SCALES FINALLY
[002:52:53;580] TIPPED WHEN IT EMERGED THAT
[002:52:55;082] HE MAY HAVE BEEN AWARE
[002:52:56;350] OF A FEDERAL EXPERIMENT
[002:52:57;885] IN TUSKEGEE, ALABAMA, WHERE
[002:52:59;120] BLACK MEN WERE ALLOWED
[002:53:00;788] TO LINGER AND DIE
[002:53:02;056] FROM UNTREATED SYPHILIS.
[002:53:03;791] FOSTER, WHO PRACTICED
[002:53:05;092] IN TUSKEGEE IN THE '60s
[002:53:06;393] AND '70s, HAS SUGGESTED

[003:05:31;630] PEOPLE, THE CALIFORNIA STATE
[003:05:32;731] LOTTERY HAS DECIDED THAT A

[003:05:34;933] THOUSANDS OF LOTTO PLAYERS

[003:05:37;102] MILLIONS THAT WERE IN LAST
[003:05:38;103] NIGHT'S JACKPOT.
[003:05:41;072] THE PROBLEM WAS THE COMPUTER
[003:05:42;207] CUT OFF SALES FOR LAST NIGHT'S
[003:05:44;476] THE NUMBERS WERE PICKED.
[003:05:45;544] PEOPLE THINKING THEY WERE
[003:05:46;645] PLAYING THE SATURDAY LOTTO
[003:05:47;779] FOUND THEMSELVES WITH TICKETS
[003:05:48;881] FOR NEXT WEDNESDAY'S DRAWING.
[003:05:50;916] TONIGHT LOTTO OFFICIALS SAY
[003:05:52;050] THOSE TICKETS WILL BE GOOD FOR
[003:05:53;018] BOTH DAYS.
[003:05:55;888] ONCE AGAIN LAST NIGHT'S
[003:05:57;054] WINNING NUMBERS WERE 2, 12, 22,
[003:06:03;861] SOME MEDICAL NEWS: IT'S OKAY TO
[003:06:04;962] EAT EGGS! A NEW REPORT SAYS
[003:06:06;063] HEALTHY PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ABLE
[003:06:07;197] TO EAT LOTS OF EGGS, WITHOUT
[003:06:08;332] WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT THEIR
[003:06:09;433] CHOLESTEROL. OUR DR. DEAN
[003:06:10;200] WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT THEIR
[003:06:10;200] CHOLESTEROL. OUR DR. DEAN
[003:06:10;200] EDELL EXPLAINS.
[003:06:15;139] EGGS HAVE SURE BEEN GETTING A
[003:06:15;940] BAD RAP LATELY...FROM RECENT
[003:06:16;741] SALMONELLA SCARES ABOUT RAW OR
[003:06:17;842] UNDERCOOKED EGGS TO EARLIER
[003:06:18;943] WARNINGS TO LAY OFF EGGS
[003:06:20;077] ALTOGETHER IF YOU'RE WORRIED
[003:06:21;111] ABOUT CHOLESTEROL.
[003:06:22;212] IN FACT, THESE LITTLE GUYS
[003:06:23;347] ARE VIEWED AS SUCH HIGH-RISK
[003:06:24;448] CHOLESTEROL-CAUSERS, THE
[003:06:25;550] AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION
[003:06:26;651] RECOMMENDS NO ONE SHOULD EAT
[003:06:27;818] MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR EGGS A
[003:06:30;254] SCIENCE, THERE MAY BE MORE TO
[003:06:31;188] THIS STORY. BECAUSE ACCORDING
[003:06:32;256] TO A NEW STUDY, IF YOUR
[003:06:33;357] HEALTHY, EGGS MIGHT NOT BE SO
[003:06:34;358] BAD FOR YOU.
[003:06:35;492] DOCTORS HAD HEALTHY YOUNG
[003:06:36;627] WOMEN EAT THREE EGGS A DAY FOR
[003:06:37;728] A WHILE. THEN THEY SWITCHED
[003:06:38;829] THEM TO ONE EGG A DAY...AND
[003:06:39;897] FINALLY TO POWDERED EGG
[003:06:40;932] SUBSTITUTES WITH NO
[003:06:42;033] CHOLESTEROL. THE RESULT: FOR
[003:06:43;133] EACH 100 MG. OF DIETARY
[003:06:44;234] CHOLESTEROL - ALMOST A SMALL
[003:06:46;470] CHOLESTEROL WENT UP LESS THAN
[003:06:47;538] LESS THAN 3 PTS. SO IF YOUR
[003:06:48;639] CHOLESTEROL IS TWO HUNDRED,
[003:06:49;740] ADDING THREE POINTS ISN'T THAT
[003:06:50;875] MUCH...AND THAT'S AN EGG EVERY
[003:06:52;009] DAY. BUT THIS IS NOT TO SAY
[003:06:53;110] YOU SHOULD START GOBBLING SO
[003:06:54;244] MANY EGGS YOU BEGIN TO CLUCK.
[003:06:55;379] REMEMBER BOTH THESE STUDIES
[003:06:56;480] INVOLVED HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE,
[003:06:57;615] WITH NO CHOLESTEROL PROBLEMS.
[003:06:58;749] SO IF YOU'RE GENERALLY CAREFUL
[003:06:59;884] ABOUT FAT INTAKE, YOU CAN HAVE
[003:07:01;018] YOUR EGGS AND EAT 'EM TOO. I'M
[003:07:02;019] DR. DEAN EDELL.
[003:07:45;462] INSIDER, TOO.
[003:07:36;052] INSIDER, TOO.
[003:07:52;102] GET A PEN AND A PIECE OF
[003:07:53;237] PAPER WE'RE GOING TO SAVE YOU
[003:07:54;204] MONEY.
[003:07:55;339] TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE HOTEL
[003:07:56;373] BUSINESS IS NOT EASY,
[003:07:57;508] ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE LIKE MOST
[003:07:58;675] OF US AND ONLY DEAL WITH HOTELS
[003:07:59;776] ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR. SO LETS
[003:08:00;877] TAKE A WALK THROUGH THE
[003:08:16;359] ALL ROOMRATES ARE NOT CREATED
[003:08:17;160] EQUAL. THAT'S BECAUSE ROOMRATES
[003:08:17;961] ARE LIKE AIRLINE TICKETS. THE
[003:08:19;062] SAME SEAT ON AN AIRLINE CAN
[003:08:20;163] HAVE TWO, THREE, EVEN FOUR
[003:08:21;264] DIFFERENT PRICES. THE SAME
[003:08:22;365] HOLDS TRUE FOR HOTELS. FOR
[003:08:23;466] EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY YOU'RE
[003:08:24;600] PLANNING ON THE WEEKEND IN SAN
[003:08:25;735] FRANCISCO. YOU AND FRIEND ARE

[003:08:34;177] doubled occupancy, for the
[003:08:35;211] evening of june 2.
[003:08:36;312] WE HAD SEVERAL RESEARCHERS
[003:08:37;446] SHOP AROUND, CALLING HOTELS ALL
[003:08:38;548] OVER SAN FRANCISCO INCUDING
[003:08:39;683] MAJOR CHAINS LIKE THE MARRIOTT,

[003:08:42;986] FIRST WE CALL THE HOTEL DIRECT.
[003:08:44;087] THEN, A SECOND CALL TO SAME

[003:08:49;159] Is that your best rate that you
[003:08:49;993] have?
[003:08:51;127] A THIRD PERSON CALLS THE SAME
[003:08:52;261] HOTELS FOR THE SAME DAY BUT
[003:08:53;362] SHE'S THE AGRRESSIVE SHOPPER
[003:08:54;463] ASKING FOR SPECIALS AND

[003:08:58;568] clubs.
[003:08:59;703] HERE ARE THE HOTELS WHERE WE
[003:09:00;837] FIND THE BIGGEST PRICE RANGE.
[003:09:01;971] THE HYATT REGENCY EMBARCADERO
[003:09:03;073] ... THE OPERATOR ON THE 800
[003:09:04;373] NUMBER SAYS NO ROOMS ARE
[003:09:05;141] AVAILABLE.
[003:09:06;275] BY CALLING DIRECT, THEY DO HAVE
[003:09:07;343] A ROOM... $220 BUCKS.
[003:09:08;411] BY ASKING FOR TRIPLE A
[003:09:09;512] DISCOUNT, WE'RE QUOTED $165.
[003:09:10;680] What will be the total charge
[003:09:11;614] on that.
[003:09:12;782] LET'S TRY THE RAMADA HOTEL AT
[003:09:13;817] THE CIVIC CENTER.

[003:09:16;018] RATE. A DIRECT CALL TO THE
[003:09:17;119] HOTEL GETS US $89, AND OUR
[003:09:18;220] DISCOUNTER GETS A QUOTE OF
[003:09:19;321] $69...A 25-DOLLAR DIFFERENCE
[003:09:20;555] FROM THE FIRST CALL.
[003:09:21;556] THE DOWNTOWN HILTON ... THE 800
[003:09:22;691] LINE QUOTES US $185. THE DIRECT

[003:10:06;034] MEMBERSHIP DISCOUNTS LIKE AARP,
[003:10:07;169] AMERICAN EXPRESS, AND TRIPLE A.

[003:14:49;081] I THINK THE TRAGEDY IS THAT
[003:14:49;948] IT SENDS A VERY NEGATIVE
[003:14:51;016] MESSAGE TO AFRICAN-AMERICAN

[003:15:10;602] ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING

[003:15:13;439] THE MILITIAS MAKE BETWEEN
[003:15:14;906] VIOLENCE AND RELIGION,

[003:15:38;063] WHAT WE FOUND IS
[003:15:39;798] A CONNECTION BETWEEN MILITIA

[003:15:41;833] SUPREMACY TEACHING
[003:15:43;302] OF THE CHRISTIAN IDENTITY

[003:15:46;771] WITH NO FORMAL LEADERSHIP
[003:15:48;073] WHOSE MEMBERS BELIEVE
[003:15:49;174] THEY ARE GOD'S CHOSEN
[003:15:50;675] PEOPLE.

[003:15:56;581] RECONSTITUTED THEMSELVES
[003:15:57;816] INTO THESE MILITIAS.
[003:15:58;717] IN THESE ISOLATED REGIONS,

[003:21:11;992] LIVE.
[003:21:12;527] MARTY?
[003:21:14;762] >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU MIGHT
[003:21:16;196] BE WONDERING WHY THE UNITED
[003:21:17;732] STATES WOULD TAKE NUCLEAR WASTE
[003:21:20;000] FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND STORE
[003:21:21;402] IT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[003:21:22;803] THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE.
[003:21:23;670] FIRST OF ALL, THE UNITED STATES
[003:21:25;271] WANTS TO PREVENT TERRORISTS FROM
[003:21:27;874] STEALING THAT MATERIAL AND
[003:21:29;208] CONCEIVABLY MAKING A NUCLEAR
[003:21:31;077] WEAPON OUT OF IT.

[003:21:33;513] OUT OF THE CONCORD NAVAL WEAPONS
[003:21:36;182] STATION OBVIOUSLY HAS PEOPLE IN
[003:21:38;318] CONCORD AND NEIGHBORS
[003:21:39;018] COMMUNITIES VERY WORRIED
[003:21:39;986] TONIGHT.
[003:21:40;353] BUT IF YOU LIVE ANYWHERE IN THE
[003:21:41;521] BAY AREA, YOU SHOULD BE
[003:21:43;222] CONCERNED.
[003:21:43;723] BECAUSE THIS RADIOACTIVE WASTE
[003:21:44;658] WOULD BE SHIPPED IN THROUGH THE
[003:21:46;660] GOLDEN GATE, INTO THE BAY, AND
[003:21:47;561] TRUCKED ON FREEWAYS VERY BUSY
[003:21:50;029] FREEWAYS LIKE I-80.
[003:21:51;431] SO THAT THE WHY THE GOVERNMENT
[003:21:52;231] IS PULLING OUT ALL STOPS TRYING
[003:21:54;634] TO CONVINCE EVERYONE THIS PLAN
[003:21:55;869] IS SAFE.
[003:21:57;170] THE GOVERNMENT HAS GONE
[003:21:58;338] TO EXTREMES, TESTING
[003:21:59;172] THE CONTAINERS THAT WOULD HOLD
[003:21:59;973] NUCLEAR WASTE.
[003:22:03;009] -- WASTE THAT WOULD BE SHIPPED
[003:22:05;311] THROUGH CONCORD, IN THIS CASE
[003:22:06;947] SMASHING A TRAIN
[003:22:07;447] INTO THE CONTAINER.

[003:22:17;824] WANT NUCLEAR WASTE SHIPPED
[003:22:18;492] IN AND OUT OF CONCORD, A MOVE
[003:22:19;225] THAT WOULD AFFECT A MUCH LARGER
[003:22:19;993] AREA.
[003:22:22;195] >> THE BAY AREA IS ONE OF THE
[003:22:23;897] LARGEST METROPOLITAN REGIONS IN
[003:22:24;664] THIS COUNTRY.
[003:22:25;331] EVEN THOUGH THE DANGER OF
[003:22:27;701] NUCLEAR ACCIDENT IS LOW, WE
[003:22:29;102] QUESTION BRINGING THE RODS
[003:22:31;371] THROUGH THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
[003:22:33;373] TO CONCORD.
[003:22:34;307] >> WE DON'T NEED TO BE SUBJECT
[003:22:35;674] TO HAZARDOUS WASTE MATERIAL WHEN
[003:22:37;343] ALL FOREIGN COUNTRIES WILL NOT
[003:22:39;045] ACCEPT IT.
[003:22:40;013] WHY SHOULD WE IN THE UNITED

[003:22:43;016] IN CONCORD, OF ALL PLACES!

[003:23:00;500] THE GOVERNMENT LIKES
[003:23:01;700] THE NAVAL WEAPONS STATION
[003:23:02;535] AS A NUCLEAR WASTE TRANSFER
[003:23:03;403] SITE, IN PART BECAUSE WORKERS
[003:23:04;437] NOW HANDLE CONTAINERS SIMILAR
[003:23:05;338] TO THOSE THAT WOULD HOLD NUCLEAR
[003:23:06;105] WASTE.

[003:23:10;643] IMPACTED BY THIS PROPOSAL!
[003:23:11;511] >> THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY WAS
[003:23:12;345] ON THE HOT SEAT TONIGHT,

[003:23:14;080] TO CONVINCE RESIDENTS THAT
[003:23:15;014] SHIPPING NUCLEAR WASTE WILL BE
[003:23:15;915] SAFE.

[003:25:13;230] THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
[003:25:14;031] UPHELD ITS ORIGINAL DECISION.

[003:25:39;990] A UNIQUE AGREEMENT
[003:25:40;658] WITH THE PARKING AUTHORITIES.

[003:25:52;570] NEIGHBORHOOD IS LIKE STRIKING
[003:25:54;004] GOLD.
[003:25:54;338] IT'S PARTICULARLY HARD IN THIS
[003:25:56;506] THREE-BLOCK AREA BECAUSE THE
[003:25:57;674] STREETS ARE SO NARROW, YOU CAN
[003:25:59;209] ONLY PARK ON ONE SIDE OF IT TO
[003:26:01;777] ALLOW EMERGENCY VEHICLES TO GO
[003:26:02;545] THROUGH.
[003:26:02;912] WELL, AFTER A MOUNTAIN OF
[003:26:04;013] PARKING TICKETS, RESIDENTS IN
[003:26:05;481] THIS AREA WENT TO THE CITY AND
[003:26:07;149] SAID, THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER
[003:26:07;917] WAY!
[003:26:09;452] FOR THE 10 YEARS THAT JOAN
[003:26:10;553] ART HAS LIVED IN BERNAL HEIGHTS,
[003:26:11;454] PARKING HAS BEEN A DAILY
[003:26:12;222] BATTLE.
[003:26:13;289] >> CLOSE TO MY HOUSE, IT'S
[003:26:14;357] IMPOSSIBLE.
[003:26:15;458] SO I HAVE TO CRUISE

[003:26:19;362] AND AROUND THROUGH ALL THE
[003:26:21;964] LITTLE NARROW STREETS TO FIND

[003:26:24;500] ROUTINELY PARK IN DRIVEWAYS
[003:26:25;435] OR ON THE SIDEWALK.
[003:26:26;302] BUT LAST FALL THEY STARTED
[003:26:27;303] GETTING TICKETS.
[003:26:28;671] A LOT OF TICKETS, AT $25 A POP.
[003:26:31;173] SO THE BERNAL HEIGHTS BLOCK CLUB
[003:26:32;575] WENT TO THE PARKING POLICE
[003:26:33;743] AND MADE A SUGSTION.
[003:26:36;412] >> INSTEAD OF BLANKET
[003:26:37;413] TICKETING, ASKING FOR A SPECIFIC
[003:26:39;815] IDENTIFICATION OF A VEHICLE,
[003:26:42;184] THAT'S, YOU KNOW, CAUSING
[003:26:45;921] PROBLEM IS ONE WAY OF REACHING A
[003:26:47;123] SOLUTION.

[003:26:49;559] TO HEART.
[003:26:50;460] IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE,
[003:26:51;894] THE DPT SAID IT WOULD ONLY GO
[003:26:53;062] AFTER CARS THAT PEOPLE
[003:26:54;230] SPECIFICALLY COMPLAINED ABOUT.
[003:26:56;165] THE REST WOULD NOT BE TARGETED.
[003:26:59;802] >> THAT'S JUST OUR ATTEMPTS TO
[003:27:03;273] BALANCE THE NEEDS OF A SPECIFIC
[003:27:04;707] COMMUNITY WITH A UNIQUE SET OF
[003:27:08;143] CIRCUMSTANCES BASED ON AN

[003:27:16;752] EVERY YEAR FOR THE CITY OF SAN
[003:27:17;786] FRANCISCO.
[003:27:19;053] HE DOES NOT HAVE A QUOTA
[003:27:20;455] TO MEET, BUT HE DOES HAVE
[003:27:21;890] A HEART.
[003:27:25;460] >> SOMETIMES I UNDERSTAND HOW
[003:27:26;762] THEY FEEL, NO ONE LIKES GETTING
[003:27:28;830] A CITATION.
[003:27:29;431] >> YOU MIGHT GET AWAY
[003:27:30;399] WITH PARKING ON YOUR DRIVEWAY.
[003:27:31;132] BUT IT'S LIKE GOING FASTER THAN
[003:27:31;900] 55 MILES PER HOUR
[003:27:32;668] ON THE FREEWAY.
[003:27:33;435] TECHNICALLY, IT'S AGAINST
[003:27:34;202] THE LAW.
[003:27:37;739] >> AND WHEN A VEHICLE IS PARKED
[003:27:39;207] ON THE SIDEWALK, IT MAY LEAK
[003:27:40;975] OIL, MAY LEAK GAS.
[003:27:41;677] YOU HAVE A LOT OF SENIOR
[003:27:43;312] CITIZENS IN THE CITY, AND THEY
[003:27:45;814] MAY SLIP AND INJURE THEMSELVES
[003:27:47;248] WITH THE VEHICLE BEING PARKED ON
[003:27:48;650] THE SIDEWALK.

[003:27:55;223] FAR FEWER PARKING TICKETS AND
[003:27:56;525] THE CITY SAYS THEY'RE GETTING
[003:27:59;994] FAR FEWER COMPLAINT, AN EXAMPLE
[003:28:00;762] OF HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN
[003:28:01;663] COOPERATE AND UNDERSTAND THE

[003:28:10;538] THIS IS THE FIRST IMAGE
[003:28:12;105] OF AMANUEL ABRAHA WE SEE.
[003:28:13;474] THE 28-YEAR-OLD IS ARRIVING
[003:28:14;709] AT THE BANK OF AMERICA JUST
[003:28:16;009] AFTER IT OPENED ONE MORNING LAST
[003:28:17;244] DECEMBER.
[003:28:18;312] HE QUICKLY DOES SOME BANKING
[003:28:19;680] AND THEN JUST HANGS AROUND
[003:28:20;781] FOR MORE THAN 20 MINUTES.
[003:28:22;082] FINALLY, HE DEMANDS TO SEE
[003:28:23;451] THE MANAGER AND REVEALS TWO HAND
[003:28:24;885] GRENADES.
[003:28:27;788] ( SIREN BLARING )
[003:28:28;689] OFFICERS ARRIVE WITHIN MINUTES.
[003:28:30;190] AND WHEN ABRAHA WON'T DROP
[003:28:31;325] THE GRENADES, HE DIES
[003:28:32;626] IN A BARRAGE OF POLICE GUNFIRE.
[003:28:36;630] ( GUNFIRE )

[003:28:42;002] WHO WAS AMANUEL ABRAHA?
[003:28:42;936] WELL, THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.
[003:28:43;838] AFTER HE WAS SHOT, POLICE FOUND
[003:28:45;239] ABRAHA WEARING MANY LAYERS
[003:28:46;407] OF CLOTHING --
[003:28:47;808] THREE PAIRS OF PANTS, SIX
[003:28:49;610] SHIRTS, AND A TIE AROUND
[003:28:51;144] THE NECK OF THE THIRD ONE IN.
[003:28:52;312] IN ADDITION TO THE HAND GRENADES
[003:28:53;581] THAT TURNED OUT TO BE DUMMIES,
[003:28:55;015] HIS BAGS HAD CONTAINED
[003:28:56;417] HANDCUFFS, FRUIT,
[003:28:57;651] AND VEGETABLES, A TOY MONKEY,
[003:28:58;919] AND SOME MEDICATION.
[003:29:00;721] THE POLICE PORTRAYED HIM
[003:29:02;256] AS A DERANGED TRANSIENT,
[003:29:03;724] ABANDONED BY HIS FAMILY.
[003:29:05;693] BUT ABRAHA HAD A HOME AND HE HAD
[003:29:06;627] A FAMILY.
[003:29:09;229] >> IT WAS LIKE A STAB
[003:29:11;499] IN THE HEART, VERY, VERY
[003:29:13;701] PAINFUL, UNDESCRIBABLE HOW
[003:29:14;868] WE FEEL.
[003:29:16;503] >> THE ABRAHAS CAME TO AMERICA
[003:29:17;804] 12 YEARS AGO TO ESCAPE A BLOODY
[003:29:19;105] CIVIL WAR IN A SMALL AFRICAN
[003:29:20;440] NATION.
[003:29:21;941] THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THE VIOLENCE
[003:29:26;145] THEY HAVE FOUND IN THIS COUNTRY
[003:29:27;146] WITH AMANUEL'S DEATH.
[003:29:31;951] .
[003:29:32;218] >> MY MOTHER IS NOT FULL OF LIFE
[003:29:33;753] AS SHE USED TO BE.
[003:29:36;823] IT'S JUST LIKE THEY TOOK OUR
[003:29:38;090] WHOLE WORLD AWAY.
[003:29:39;592] >> THEY ACKNOWLEDGE AMANUEL HAD
[003:29:40;493] A HISTORY OF MENTAL PROBLEMS
[003:29:41;327] AND THAT HE WAS CONVICTED
[003:29:42;261] OF ARMED ROBBERY IN 1990.
[003:29:43;496] STILL, THEY CLAIM THAT THEIR SON
[003:29:47;099] AND BROTHER WAS GETTING
[003:29:47;767] HIS LIFE TOGETHER.
[003:29:48;701] SO THE ABRAHAS HAVE RETAINED
[003:29:49;469] A LAWYER TO FIND OUT WHETHER
[003:29:50;269] THERE ARE GROUNDS
[003:29:51;270] FOR A LAWSUIT.
[003:29:52;972] DAVID SCHWARTZ ARGUES WITH THAT
[003:29:54;140] FIRST SHOT, THE POLICE STARTED
[003:29:55;742] A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THAT COULD
[003:29:57;310] END ONLY WITH THE DEATH
[003:29:58;144] OF THE SUSPECT.
[003:30:01;180] >> WHAT YOU WOULD WANT SOMEBODY
[003:30:03;215] TO DO IN THAT SITUATION IS SAY,
[003:30:05;518] STOP.
[003:30:06;185] EVERYBODY STOP.
[003:30:07;554] AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN START
[003:30:08;287] ALL OVER AGAIN.
[003:30:10;022] AND MAKE HIM REALIZE THAT IF HE
[003:30:12;124] DOES COME OUT, HE'S NOT GOING TO
[003:30:13;460] BE KILLED.
[003:30:14;661] >> SCHWARTZ AND THE ABRAHAS MAY

[003:31:32;904] FRIDAY NIGHT WE MISSED THE
[003:31:33;704] LAUNCH OF THE WEATHER SATELLITE
[003:31:35;340] BECAUSE OF THE BAD WEATHER.
[003:31:37;409] BUT THE SKIES HAVE CLEARED,
[003:31:39;010] EVERYTHING LOOKED GOOD, AND JUST
[003:31:40;445] MINUTES AGO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED
[003:31:41;546] AT THE CAPE.
[003:31:42;947] >> PROPEL PENTS -- PROPEL WENTS.
[003:31:48;953] >> 3, 2, WE HAVE IGNITION.
[003:31:52;323] ALL ENGINES ARE UP AND BURNING.
[003:31:55;060] AND WE HAVE(
[003:31:58;729] CENTAUR 77 AND THE WEATHER
[003:31:59;564] SATELLITE.
[003:32:00;532] >> IT'S ESPECIALLY GOOD NEWS
[003:32:03;535] BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 8
[003:32:06;404] YEARS, WE'LL HAVE THE FULL
[003:32:07;638] COMPLEMENT OF WEATHER
[003:32:08;339] SATELLITES.
[003:32:09;107] WE'VE GOT TWO OF THEM UP THERE
[003:32:09;974] AND THEY WERE BUILT HEIGHT HERE
[003:32:12;310] IN -- RIGHT HERE IN THE BAY
[003:32:14;011] AREA.
[003:32:14;345] THOSE ARE THE FOLKS WHO PUT
[003:32:15;613] TOGETHER THE WEATHER SATELLITE
[003:32:16;381] THAT WAS LAUNCHED JUST MINUTES
[003:32:18;483] AGO.
[003:32:19;184] GOOD JOB FOR THEM AND THE LATEST
[003:32:20;751] THAT WE HEARD FROM THE CAPE IS
[003:32:21;686] THAT THE LAUNCH WAS FLAWLESS AND
[003:32:24;088] IT LOOKS GOOD.
[003:32:26;623] LOOKS NICE BY SATURN TONIGHT.
[003:32:28;692] THIS IS THE TYPICAL VIEW YOU
[003:32:30;394] HAVE.
[003:32:30;727] BUT IF YOU LOOKED AT IT OVER A
[003:32:31;928] PERIOD OF YEARS, AS BELIEVE IT
[003:32:33;464] OR NOT I HAVE, YOU'LL NOTICE THE
[003:32:34;998] PICTURE OF THE PLANET CHANGES
[003:32:36;166] FROM THAT TO THAT.
[003:32:37;468] YOU ETHE ORIENTATION OF THE
[003:32:39;169] RINGS CHANGE OVER THE YEARS.
[003:32:40;537] SOTIMES ULUREK THAT WAY AND
[003:32:42;406] METIMES THAT WAY.
[003:32:42;973] AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE EDGE-ON,
[003:32:45;342] AND HERE'S WHY.
[003:32:46;543] >> SATURN ORBITS THE SUN EVERY
[003:32:52;549] 20 YEARS.
[003:32:53;217] IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW THE
[003:32:54;618] RINGS, EDGE ONASEEN FROM THE
[003:32:56;320] EARTH.
[003:32:56;987] AND SINCE THE RINGS ARE CLOSED
[003:32:58;054] AND THEY'RE SCATTERED -- THEIR
[003:33:00;324] SCATTERED LIGHT IS GONE, IT'S A
[003:33:01;391] EA TO LOOK FOR NEW
[003:33:02;692] SATELLITETS THAT ORBIT SATURN.
[003:33:04;428] >> AND IN FACT, TELESCOPES
[003:33:06;463] DISCOVERED FOUR NEWMANS -- MOONS
[003:33:08;665] THE LAST TIME THIS EDGE-ON THING
[003:33:11;034] HAPPENED IN 1980.
[003:33:13;370] WE'LL LAUNCH A NEW PROBE FROM
[003:33:15;038] SATURN THE NOONZ 97 FOR A REAL
[003:33:16;840] GOOD LOOK AND WE HAVE A FEW MORE
[003:33:18;708] OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE THE RINGS'
[003:33:22;179] EDGE FOR THE NEXT 9s MONTHS AND
[003:33:23;647] THEN IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN UNTIL
[003:33:25;182] THE YEAR 2010.
[003:33:26;816] HOW ABOUT THE CLOUDY PLANET
[003:33:29;519] EARTH, AT LEAST IN OUR NECK OF
[003:33:31;054] THE WOODS.
[003:33:31;721] SOCKED IN TODAY.
[003:33:33;156] GOT A LITTLE BIT OF CLEARING AS
[003:33:34;658] WE SORT OF PROMISED TOWARD THE
[003:33:35;725] END OF THE DAY.
[003:33:37;127] TIME LAPSE HERE SHOWS WHY.
[003:33:38;662] IT'S JUST A LOT OF MOISTURE
[003:33:40;196] ALONG THE COASTLINE.
[003:33:41;031] UPPER LEVEL LOW THAT HAS BEEN
[003:33:43;432] PLAGUING US AND PROMISES NOT TO
[003:33:44;267] LEAVE ANYTIME SOON AND THE
[003:33:45;769] RESULTS FOR THE BAY AREA, IS NOT
[003:33:47;436] A GOOD RESULT.
[003:33:48;138] LOOK AT SOME SUNSHINE TOMORROW,
[003:33:50;073] BUT WE'LL GO WITH STRATUS QUO
[003:33:52;142] AGAIN, THE USUAL LOW CLOUDS IN
[003:33:54;510] THE MORNING, NO BIG CHANGES AND
[003:33:55;845] IF YOU LIKE SUNSHINE, THAT'S NOT
[003:33:56;946] GOOD NEWS.
[003:33:57;413] COASTAL CLOUDS MOVING INLAND,
[003:33:59;783] LOWS TONIGHT 46 TO 56 DEGREES.
[003:34:02;085] CLOUDY THE TOMORROW,
[003:34:04;353] HIGHS 58 TO 74 DEGREES.
[003:34:05;388] ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE NEW
[003:34:07;290] SATELLITES, THEY SHOULD HOPE US
[003:34:08;058] WITH THIS, THE LONG-RANGE
[003:34:09;693] FORECASTS, WHICH AT LEAST WITH
[003:34:10;493] THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY, SHOWS
[003:34:12;829] US WE'LL GET THE OLD LOW CLOUDS
[003:34:15;131] ALONG THE COASTLINE.
[003:34:15;965] YOU DIDN'T NEED THE SATELLITE TO
[003:34:17;300] TELL YOU THAT.
[003:34:17;767] >> BOY, THANK YOU, SIR.
[003:34:18;401] >> ALL RIGHT!
[003:34:20;036] >>> IT LITERALLY BROUGHT THE TOP
[003:34:20;804] BRASS DOWN.
[003:34:21;304] TONIGHT, YOU HAD A LOOK
[003:34:22;305] AT THE TAILHOOK SCANDAL.
[003:34:23;173] NOW FIND OUT WHERE THE NAVY
[003:34:24;207] LIEUTENANT WHO EXPOSED IT ALL IS
[003:34:24;841] NOW FIND OUT WHERE THE NAVY
[003:34:24;841] LIEUTENANT WHO EXPOSED IT ALL IS
[003:34:24;841] TODAY.Ñ8óHÑ.#r5u#ñq
[003:40:55;392] IN CASE THE WALL OF D-N-A
[003:40:56;159] EVIDENCE WASN'T HIGH ENOUGH,
[003:40:57;861] THE PROSECUTION IN THE O-J
[003:40:58;729] SIMPSON TRIAL PILED ON STILL
[003:40:59;496] MORE BRICKS TODAY.
[003:41:01;030] A NEW WITNESS PRESENTED A NEW
[003:41:01;965] SERIES OF BLOOD TEST RESULTS.
[003:41:03;900] BUT THE CONCLUSIONS WERE MUCH
[003:41:04;701] THE SAME.
[003:41:05;134] BOB MACKENZIE HAS OUR REPORT:
[003:41:09;639] CRIMINALIST RENEE MONTGOMERY
[003:41:12;308] TODAY DISCLOSED YET ANOTHER DNA
[003:41:13;743] TEST THAT LINKS O.J. SIMPSON TO
[003:41:14;911] THE CRIME SCENE.
[003:41:20;817] UNDER QUESTIONING BY PROSECUTOR
[003:41:22;218] ROCKNE HARMON, THE WITNESS SAID
[003:41:25;021] O.J.'S BLOOD HAS THE SAME DNA
[003:41:26;422] PATTERN AS THREE BLOOD DROPS
[003:41:29;225] FOUND AT BUNDY DRIVE --
[003:41:30;693] INCLUDING TWO DROPS FROM THE
[003:41:32;128] WALKWAY AND ONE FOUND CLOSEST
[003:41:33;262] TO THE BODIES.
[003:41:40;603] There's a 24 allele. There's
[003:41:42;005] the 25 allele. And that's
[003:41:43;472] consistent with Mr. Simpson?
[003:41:44;240] Yes.
[003:41:51;514] MONTGOMERY, WHO WORKS AT THE
[003:41:52;281] CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF
[003:41:52;982] JUSTICE DNA LAB IN BERKELEY,
[003:41:53;750] ALSO IDENTIFIED A DROP OF BLOOD
[003:41:54;717] FROM SIMPSON'S DRIVEWAY AS
[003:41:55;451] MATCHING SIMPSON'S BLOOD.
[003:41:56;619] What type did that produce in
[003:41:57;386] the d1s80 system? That's a 24,
[003:41:58;187] 25.
[003:41:58;921] MONTGOMERY SPECIALIZES IN THE
[003:41:59;856] DNA TESTING TECHNIQUE CALLED
[003:42:00;623] D-ONE-S-80, WHICH SHE CALLED A
[003:42:01;423] MARRIAGE OF PCR AND RFLP --
[003:42:02;158] TESTING TECHNIQUES THE JURY HAS
[003:42:02;959] ALREADY HEARD ABOUT.
[003:42:03;592] So you got the same results
[003:42:04;326] from the stain in Mr. Simpson's
[003:42:05;128] driveway with do you want to
[003:42:05;895] say marker as you did with 47
[003:42:06;663] the drop closest to the
[003:42:07;329] victims, 48 next down the
[003:42:08;031] walkway, and 50 the next one
[003:42:08;798] down the walkway. Correct.
[003:42:34;557] 48 next down the walkway, and
[003:42:35;324] 50 the next one down the
[003:42:36;024] walkway. Correct.
[003:42:36;592] CALLING ON OTHER D-ONE-S-80
[003:42:37;326] RESULTS, MONTGOMERY SAID THAT
[003:42:38;093] BLOOD SPOTS FOUND ON THE
[003:42:38;794] VICTIM'S CLOTHING WERE
[003:42:39;461] MIXED....THAT IS, BLOOD
[003:42:40;128] MATCHING RON GOLDMAN'S APPEARS
[003:42:40;929] ON NICOLE SIMPSON'S CLOTHING,
[003:42:41;697] ALONG WITH HER OWN... WHILE
[003:42:42;431] BLOOD MATCHING HERS WAS FOUND
[003:42:43;199] ON GOLDMAN'S CLOTHES. O.J.'S
[003:42:43;965] DNA PATTERN DID NOT TURN UP ON
[003:42:44;766] THOSE GARMENTS.
[003:42:45;301] DEFENSE ATTORNEY ROBERT BLASIER
[003:42:46;101] BORE DOWN ON MONTGOMERY'S
[003:42:46;802] QUALIFICATIONS IN
[003:42:47;369] CROSS-EXAMINATION,
[003:42:47;969] TRYING TO SHOW THAT SHE'S JUST
[003:42:48;770] A LAB TECHNICIAN, NOT AN
[003:42:49;471] AUTHORITY.
[003:42:50;673] Did anything in your
[003:42:51;740] undergraduate background cover
[003:42:53;475] forensic application of DNA
[003:42:54;210] technology?
[003:42:54;677] No.
[003:42:57;479] BLASIER NEEDLED THE WITNESS
[003:42:58;581] ABOUT THE TINY AMOUNTS OF
[003:43:01;783] NON-MATCHING DNA THAT TURNED UP
[003:43:02;984] IN SOME SAMPLES....DNA THE
[003:43:03;752] WITNESS CALLED HINTS AND
[003:43:04;453] TRACES.
[003:43:05;187] HE WAS SKEPTICAL OF THE THE
[003:43:06;655] ACCURACY AND DEPENDABILITY OF
[003:43:07;423] D-ONE-S-80 TESTING.
[003:43:10;226] Now this system also has a
[003:43:11;026] characteristic that if samples
[003:43:11;827] are degraded you can lose
[003:43:13;161] bands, correct?You could lose
[003:43:13;929] your entire, you could get no
[003:43:14;697] results with degraded samples,
[003:43:15;497] yes.
[003:43:16;098] You could also selectively lose
[003:43:16;898] bands can't you?
[003:43:18;166] Very very low levels, it's
[003:43:18;900] unusual to lose bands.
[003:43:19;535] Is that a yes?
[003:43:20;235] Objection.Sustained.
[003:43:32;447] DID BLASIER SUCCEED IN MAKING
[003:43:36;752] MONTGOMERY'S TESTS APPEAR
[003:43:38;120] DUBIOUS? ONLY THE JURY KNOWS.
[003:43:44;960] AN INTERESTING RUNNING THEME
[003:43:46;294] LATELY HAS BEEN THE
[003:43:48;396] PROSECUTION'S PERSISTENCE IN
[003:43:50;331] BRINGING UP A CERTAIN NAME.
[003:43:56;071] Do you know Dr. Ed Blake?
[003:43:57;773] Yes I do.
[003:44:01;877] To your knowledge is his
[003:44:03;879] laboratory doing d1s80 work
[003:44:04;612] now?
[003:44:04;946] Yes they are.
[003:44:06;547] DR ED BLAKE IS A SCIENTIST WHO
[003:44:08;049] WAS ANNOUNCED EARLY ON AS A
[003:44:08;984] DEFENSE WITNESS, RUNNING HIS
[003:44:09;918] OWN DNA TESTS ON BEHALF OF O.J.
[003:44:10;718] SIMPSON. BLAKE HAS SINCE
[003:44:12;220] DROPPED OUT OF THE DEFENSE AND
[003:44:13;021] WILL NOT BE PRESENTING HIS TEST
[003:44:13;822] RESULTS. NO DOUBT THE
[003:44:14;455] PROSECUTION WILL WANT THE JURY
[003:44:15;257] TO ASK WHY.
[003:44:16;758] RENEE MONTGOMERY WILL BE BACK
[003:44:17;525] ON THE WITNESS STAND TOMORROW,
[003:44:18;326] AGAIN UNDER CROSS-EXAMINATION
[003:44:19;094] AND UNDER ATTACK BY DEFENSE
[003:44:19;828] ATTORNEY ROBERT BLASIER. SO FAR
[003:44:20;628] SHE'S HELD UP WELL. BOB

[003:44:31;172] WE'LL HAVE A LIVE REPORT FROM
[003:44:32;307] ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPOTS
[003:44:34;409] IN THE WORLD... A PLACE YOU MAY
[003:44:35;376] NOT BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE INTO

[003:44:38;078] YOSEMITE.
[003:44:39;814] AND DIANE DWYER WILL HAVE A

[003:47:22;441] ONE OF SAN
[003:47:49;334] FRANCISCO'S MOST FAMOUS TOURIST
[003:47:50;135] ATTRACTIONS, THE "CROOKEDEST
[003:47:50;902] STREET IN THE WORLD" IS ABOUT
[003:47:52;604] TO BE CLOSED TO THE THOUSANDS
[003:47:53;638] OF TOURISTS WHO DRIVE DOWN IT
[003:47:54;406] EACH YEAR.
[003:47:56;241] DIANE DWYER IS IN SAN
[003:47:56;941] FRANCISCO WITH A LIVE REPORT:

[003:50:31;728] çO;?Q 50,0.
[003:50:59;922] THESE GENES ARE WHAT MAKE SOME
[003:51:01;357] OF US BLOND OR GIVE THE GUY NEXT
[003:51:03;826] DOOR HIS BIG FEET, AND THE WOMAN
[003:51:05;795] AT WORK HER CURLY HAIR.
[003:51:08;431] YOUR D.N.A., LIKE YOUR
[003:51:09;031] FINGERPRINT, IS UNIQUE TO YOU,
[003:51:10;633] SO IF A PROSECUTOR CAN MATCH A
[003:51:11;934] D.N.A. SAMPLE FROM YOUR BLOOD
[003:51:13;969] WITH A D.N.A. SAMPLE FROM A
[003:51:15;338] CRIME SCENE, THAT COULD BE
[003:51:16;306] ENOUGH TO CONVICT YOU.
[003:51:19;475] FORENSIC SCIENTISTS EXTRACT
[003:51:20;910] D.N.A. FROM BLOOD OR OTHER BODY
[003:51:22;378] FLUIDS FOUND AT THE SCENE OF A
[003:51:23;145] CRIME, AND THEY DON'T NEED MUCH.
[003:51:27;317] >> David Bing: WE CAN DO D.N.A.
[003:51:28;651] TESTING ON A BLOOD SPOT THE SIZE
[003:51:29;419] OF A PENCIL POINT.
[003:51:30;953] >> Stahl: DR. DAVID BING RUNS
[003:51:32;021] THE CENTER FOR BLOOD RESEARCH IN
[003:51:32;788] BOSTON.
[003:51:35;225] WHY ARE WE PUTTING GLOVES ON?
[003:51:36;092] >> Bing: BECAUSE YOU CAN LEAVE
[003:51:37;860] ENGH D.N.A. FROM YOUR FINGERS
[003:51:40;263] BEHIND THAT WE COULD PICK IT UP
[003:51:41;197] LATER ON.
[003:51:43;132] AND WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE IT.
[003:51:46;603] >> Stahl: SO IF I TOUCH A
[003:51:47;803] SAMPLE, THEN MY D.N.A. WILL END
[003:51:48;938] UP AS PART OF IT?
[003:51:51;707] >> Bing: IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
[003:51:53;174] >> Stahl: IN CRIME CASES, D.N.A.
[003:51:53;975] IS MOST COMMONLY RETRIEVED FROM
[003:51:55;176] SAMPLES OF BLOOD OR MEN.
[003:51:57;178] BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.
[003:52:00;315] I RECENTLY SAW, IN A BIG CASE IN
[003:52:01;717] NEW YORK CITY, THAT THE
[003:52:03;151] SCIENTISTS GOT SOME D.N.A. FROM
[003:52:04;319] SALIVA ON THE LICKING OF A
[003:52:06;020] LETTER.
[003:52:09;258] WHERE CAN YOU GET THE D.N.
[003:52:09;958] FROM?
[003:52:11;760] IS IT REALLY THAT SOPHISTICATED?
[003:52:12;628] >> Bing: YES, IT IS.
[003:52:14;563] THE SALIVA ALWAYS HAS CELLS THAT
[003:52:16;064] ARE CONTINUALLY SHED FROM THE
[003:52:16;798] INSIDE OF ONE'S MOUTH.
[003:52:19;601] >> Stahl: SO LET'S SAY THAT I'M
[003:52:22;003] THE POLICE, ALL RIGHT, AND I
[003:52:23;938] COME TO YOU WITH SOME EVIDENCE
[003:52:24;773] WITH BLOOD ON IT.
[003:52:27;242] SHOW US WHAT SOME OF THE BITS OF
[003:52:28;977] EVIDENCE WITH LITTLE TINY BITS
[003:52:30;679] OF BLOOD ON IT LOOK LIKE.
[003:52:33;848] >> Bing: THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
[003:52:34;616] CAME IN.
[003:52:34;983] THIS IS, IN FACT, PART OF A
[003:52:35;684] HOMICIDE.
[003:52:36;585] IT'S A RAPE HOMICIDE.
[003:52:38;553] AND WHAT THIS IS, IS THIS A
[003:52:39;588] PIECE OF PAPER THAT WAS
[003:52:40;221] COLLECTED AT THE SCENE.
[003:52:41;723] THE WOMAN WAS A TEACHER.
[003:52:44;159] >> Stahl: AND WHAT'S ON IT?
[003:52:45;193] >> Bing: WELL, IF YOU LOOK VERY
[003:52:46;161] CAREFULLY, THERE'S THESE LITTLE
[003:52:47;429] TEENY STAINS AROUND HERE.
[003:52:49;898] AND ALTHOUGH IT'S... AND THERE'S
[003:52:51;265] ONE DOWN HERE, BUT MOSTLY UP
[003:52:52;232] AROUND HERE.
[003:52:53;967] >> Stahl: THE LAB CUT OUT A
[003:52:55;002] SMALL BLOODSTAIN TO USE IN A
[003:52:55;703] D.N.A. TEST.
[003:52:57;805] HOW OLD IS THAT CASE?
[003:52:59;072] >> Bing: THIS IS 12 YEARS OLD.
[003:53:01;241] WE'VE DONE THIS STAINS THAT HAVE
[003:53:02;009] BEEN 40 YEARS OLD.
[003:53:03;678] >> Stahl: IN THE MOST WIDELY
[003:53:04;845] USED TEST, SCIENTISTS ACTUALLY
[003:53:06;079] GO INTO THE CELLS AND CUT OUT
[003:53:06;814] PIECES OF D.N.A.
[003:53:10;518] THOSE PIECES, CALLED GENETIC
[003:53:11;719] MARKERS, ARE INJECTED INTO A GEL
[003:53:13;220] AND THEN PHOTOGRAPHED ON X-RAY
[003:53:13;954] FILM.
[003:53:17;925] THIS FILM SHOWS THE RESULTS OF A
[003:53:18;693] TEST IN A RAPE CASE.
[003:53:21;629] ON THE LEFT IS A SPERM SAMPLE
[003:53:22;363] TAKEN FROMHE VICTIM.
[003:53:24;998] ON THE RIGHT ARE D.N.A. SAMPLES
[003:53:25;766] FROM A NUMBER OF SUSPECTS.
[003:53:29;837] >> Bing: NOW, UP HERE, HERE'S
[003:53:30;571] THE SPERM SAMPLE UP HERE.
[003:53:32;206] AND THERE'S TWO LITTLE BANDS UP
[003:53:32;973] HERE.
[003:53:35;810] AND HERE IS ONE OF THE SUSPECTS,
[003:53:36;610] AND HE'S GOT TWO BANDS THERE AS
[003:53:37;578] WELL.
[003:53:38;479] THAT'S A MATCH.
[003:53:40;948] >> Stahl: THAT'S A MATCH.
[003:53:42;450] >> Bing: NOW, HERE'S SOME OTHER
[003:53:43;317] FOLKS IN THIS CASE WHO THEY HAD
[003:53:44;318] SUSPECTED MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN
[003:53:45;052] THE CRIME.
[003:53:47;521] AND HERE'S ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL.
[003:53:48;456] THAT DOESN'T MATCH THIS AT ALL.
[003:53:49;657] HERE'S ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL.
[003:53:50;991] NOW, THERE'S TWO BANDS HERE
[003:53:52;326] CLOSE TOGETHER, BUT THEY'RE IN A
[003:53:53;661] VERY DIFFERENT SPOT, SO THAT
[003:53:54;795] DOESN'T MATCH.
[003:53:58;598] >> Stahl: WHEN IT DOESN'T MATCH,
[003:53:59;366] THE SUSPECT IS INNOCENT.
[003:54:00;800] AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF EVIDENCE
[003:54:01;869] DEFENSE ATTORNEY PETER NEUFELD
[003:54:02;602] IS LOOKING FOR.
[003:54:05;372] >> Neufeld: YOU ALWAYS DREAM
[003:54:07;040] ABOUT HAVING A TRULY INNOCENT
[003:54:08;208] CLIENT FOR WHOM YOU CAN SECURE
[003:54:09;376] THEIR FREEDOM.
[003:54:12;512] AND WITH THESE KINDS OF CASES,
[003:54:14;481] WE'RE FINDING INDIVIDUALS O
[003:54:16;516] HAVE SPENT TEN OR 15 YEARS IN
[003:54:18;252] PRISON-- INDEED, SOME OF THEM
[003:54:20;287] SENTENCED TO DEATH-- WHERE WE
[003:54:22;890] ACTUALLY CAN SECURE THE KEYS TO
[003:54:23;723] THEIR FREEDOM.
[003:54:26;126] >> Stahl: NEUFELD AND HIS
[003:54:27;394] PARTNER, BARRY SCHECK, WANTED TO
[003:54:28;896] CLEAR PEOPLE USING D.N.A. TESTS,
[003:54:30;297] AND SO THEY STARTED THE
[003:54:31;365] INNOCENCE PROJECT AT THE CARDOZO
[003:54:32;132] LAW SCHOOL.
[003:54:35;568] THEY GET HUNDREDS OF LETTERS
[003:54:36;703] FROM PRISONERS ASKING FOR THE
[003:54:38;238] TEST TO PROVE THEY WERE
[003:54:39;139] WRONGFULLY CONVICTED.
[003:54:41;741] ONE OF THOSE LETTERS CAME FROM
[003:54:42;742] PRISONER BRIAN PIESZCZEK.
[003:54:44;677] THREE YEARS AGO, HE WAS
[003:54:45;745] CONVICTED OF RAPE AND ASSAULT
[003:54:46;546] WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.
[003:54:49;283] >> Pieszczek: I SAID I DIDN'T DO
[003:54:50;217] IT FROM DAY ONE, BUT NOBODY
[003:54:51;351] REALLY LISTENED TO ME, OR CARED
[003:54:52;319] TO LISTEN.
[003:54:53;620] >> Stahl: YOU WERE FOUND GUILTY
[003:54:54;854] IN THE TRIAL AND SENTENCED TO
[003:54:55;889] HOW LONG?
[003:54:57;324] >> Pieszczek: 15 TO 25 YEARS.
[003:55:00;159] >> Stahl: WHAT DID HE WRITE THAT
[003:55:00;960] LED YOU TO...
[003:55:02;295] >> Scheck: WELL, HE JUST SAID,
[003:55:03;896] YOU KNOW, INSISTED THAT HE HAD
[003:55:04;630] BEEN INNOCENT.
[003:55:06;698] HE INSISTED ON HIS INNOCENCE
[003:55:07;967] FROM THE DAY HE WAS ARRESTED.
[003:55:09;601] BUT HE WAS DEMANDING A D.N.A.
[003:55:10;702] TEST, HE SAID, FROM THE MOMENT
[003:55:11;437] HE WAS ARRESTED.
[003:55:16;075] >> Stahl: HE'S BEEN IN PRISON
[003:55:16;809] FOR FOUR YEARS.
[003:55:18;610] FINALLY, THIS YEAR, THROUGH THE
[003:55:19;812] INNOCENCE PROJECT, BRIAN
[003:55:20;679] PIESZCZEK GOT TESTED.
[003:55:23;449] SO YOU TOOK THE D.N.A. TEST.
[003:55:24;883] WHAT WAS THE RESULT?
[003:55:26;452] >> Pieszczek: CAME UP NEGATIVE,
[003:55:27;253] PROVING I'M INNOCENT.
[003:55:28;821] >> Tim Dobeck: UNTIL THE D.N.A.
[003:55:30;622] CAME BACK, I HAD NO QUESTIONS
[003:55:32;091] THAT HE WAS, IN FACT, GUILTY.
[003:55:33;392] >> Stahl: PROSECUTOR TIM DOBECK
[003:55:35;161] HAD NO QUESTION BECAUSE THE
[003:55:36;362] VICTIM HELPED POLICE DRAW THIS
[003:55:37;896] PICTURE THAT LOOKS REMARKABLY
[003:55:39;031] LIKE PIESZCZEK, AND SHE SAID SHE
[003:55:41;300] WAS SURE BRIAN PIESZCZEK WAS THE
[003:55:43;202] ONE WHO HAD RAPED HER.
[003:55:45;771] >> Dobeck: I THOUGHT THIS CASE
[003:55:46;572] WAS OPEN AND CLOSED.
[003:55:47;706] THE COURT OF APPEALS HAD EVEN
[003:55:48;807] RULED ON IT AND AFFIRMED THE
[003:55:50;009] CONVICTION.
[003:55:51;377] >> Stahl: BECAUSE THE VICTIM HAD
[003:55:52;744] SO STRONGLY AND ADAMANTLY
[003:55:53;512] IDENTIFIED HIM?
[003:55:57;049] >> Dobeck: YES.
[003:55:57;683] AND I SHOULD ADD, TO THIS DAY,
[003:55:58;717] SHE STILL BELIEVES THAT HE'S THE
[003:55:59;485] PERSON.
[003:56:00;619] >> Stahl: EVEN AFTER THE D.N.A.
[003:56:01;387] TEST?
[003:56:01;854] >> Dobeck: EVEN AFTER THE D.N.A.
[003:56:02;621] TEST.
[003:56:03;755] >> Stahl: DOBECK TOLD US BRIAN
[003:56:04;790] PIESZCZEK WOULD PROBABLY BE
[003:56:05;491] RELEASED FROM PRISON.
[003:56:08;194] EVEN IF THE VICTIM CONTINUES TO
[003:56:09;195] INSIST HE'S THE ONE WHO
[003:56:10;596] PERPETRATED THE RAPE?
[003:56:13;532] >> Dobeck: GOING BACK TO THE
[003:56:14;733] RELIABILITY OF THE D.N.A., WE
[003:56:15;801] BELIEVE IN IT, AND WE WOULD
[003:56:16;969] BELIEVE THEN THAT SHE IS
[003:56:17;903] MISTAKEN.
[003:56:20;338] >> Scheck: WE'VE KNOW THAT
[003:56:21;540] MISTAKEN IDENTIFICATION IS THE
[003:56:23;842] CHIEF CAUSE OF THE CONVICTION OF
[003:56:25;811] THE INNOCENT FOR A LONG TIME,
[003:56:27;479] BUT NOW, D.N. TESTING IS
[003:56:28;947] SHOWING US THAT IT IS A FAR MORE
[003:56:31;016] PREVALENT PHENOMENON THAN WE
[003:56:32;551] FEARED.
[003:56:36;955] >> Stahl: AND THE F.B.I. BACKS
[003:56:37;689] THAT UP.
[003:56:39;124] WHEN THE BUREAU RAN THEIR OWN
[003:56:40;458] D.N.A. TESTS ON RAPE SUSPECTS, A
[003:56:42;561] THIRD OF THE MEN WHO HAD BEEN
[003:56:43;662] ARRESTED TURNED OUT TO BE
[003:56:44;329] INNOCENT.
[003:56:47;332] THERE WERE NO D.N.A. TESTS TEN
[003:56:48;667] YEARS AGO WHEN ED HONECKER WAS
[003:56:50;235] SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR
[003:56:51;003] RAPE AND ABDUCTION.
[003:56:54;239] THE VICTIM WAS INSISTENT THAT
[003:56:55;407] SHE COULD NEVER FORGET THE MAN
[003:56:56;141] WHO HAD RAPED HER.
[003:56:58;510] I ACTUALLY HAVE A TRANSCRIPT OF
[003:56:59;277] THE TRIAL.
[003:57:02;814] THE PROSECUTOR SAID TO HER, "IS
[003:57:03;582] THERE ANY DOUBT IN YOUR MIND?"
[003:57:05;584] AND SHE SAID, "NO, SIR, NO.
[003:57:07;485] NO DOUBT AT ALL.
[003:57:09;922] THIS IS THE MAN RIGHT HERE,
[003:57:10;689] SITTING RIGHT HERE.
[003:57:12;157] THERE IS NO DOUBT."
[003:57:15;794] >> Honecker: YEAH.
[003:57:17;262] >> Stahl: SHE WAS A VERY
[003:57:18;263] BELIEVABLE, OBVIOUSLY, WITNESS.
[003:57:20;432] >> Honecker: WELL, I HAVE STATED
[003:57:21;499] BEFORE THAT HAD I BEEN ON THE
[003:57:23;535] JURY INSTEAD OF THE DEFENDANT, I
[003:57:25;836] WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOUND EDWARD
[003:57:26;904] HONECKER GUILTY OF THAT CRIME.
[003:57:30;641] >> Stahl: THE JURY WAS ALSO TOLD
[003:57:31;842] BY A FORENSIEXPERT THAT A HAIR
[003:57:33;445] FOUND ON THE VICTIM "ALMOST
[003:57:34;579] CERTAINLY" CAME FROM HONECKER,@
[003:57:37;215] AND HE HAD NO MONEY TO HIRE HIS
[003:57:38;450] OWN EXPERTS TO REEXAMINE THE
[003:57:39;150] EVIDENCE.
[003:57:42;587] >> Scheck: THE HONECKER CASE IS
[003:57:43;721] A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF ALL THE
[003:57:44;456] THINGS THAT CAN GO WRONG.
[003:57:48;259] AND REMEMBER, HONECKER ALSO HAD
[003:57:49;026] A VASECTOMY.
[003:57:50;962] I MEAN, THE EXTRAORDINARY THING
[003:57:52;363] ABOUT THIS CASE IS THAT HONECKER
[003:57:53;764] HAD A VASECTOMY AND HE COULDN'T
[003:57:54;899] EJACULATE SPERM.
[003:57:56;901] >> Stahl: AND THEY FOUND SPERM.
[003:57:58;570] >> Scheck: THEY FOUND SPERM.
[003:57:59;937] >> Stahl: LAST MONTH, THE D.N.A.
[003:58:02;207] TEST SHOWED THAT THE SPERM DID
[003:58:03;040] NOT COME FROM HONECKER.
[003:58:05;477] BUT IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA,
[003:58:07;212] NEW EVIDENCE, INCLUDING D.N.A.,
[003:58:08;779] IS NOT GROUNDS FOR A NEW TRIAL
[003:58:09;514] TEN YEARS AFTER THE FACT.
[003:58:13;351] THE ONLY WAY HONECKER CAN GET
[003:58:14;685] OUT OF PRISON IS IF THE GOVERNOR
[003:58:15;453] PARDONS HIM.
[003:58:17;688] WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE CRITICS
[003:58:19;390] WHO ARGUE THAT "LOOK, THESE
[003:58:20;425] PEOPLE GOT A FAIR TRIAL.
[003:58:23;894] WE CANNOT RETRY EVERY CASE.
[003:58:25;730] OUR SOCIETY JUST CAN'T AFFORD
[003:58:26;463] THIS.
[003:58:27;431] WE CAN'T GO THROUGH IT."
[003:58:30;835] YOU KNOW, "LET SLEEPING DOGS
[003:58:31;602] LIE."
[003:58:32;903] >> Scheck: I THINK THE BOTTOM
[003:58:35;405] LINE HERE IS THAT IT IS
[003:58:37;207] ABSOLUTELY ANTITHETICAL TO THE
[003:58:38;275] FUNDAMENTAL PRECEPTS OF OUR
[003:58:39;543] CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO ALLOW
[003:58:41;012] AN INNOCENT PERSON TO ROT IN
[003:58:42;513] JAIL WHEN THERE'S DEFINITIVE
[003:58:44;715] EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT PERSON IS
[003:58:45;716] INNOCENT.
[003:58:49;053] >> Stahl: SCHECK AND NEUFELD
[003:58:50;320] HAVE USED THIS DEFINITIVE
[003:58:51;288] EVIDENCE TO GET EIGHT PEOPLE OUT
[003:58:52;056] OF PRISON SO FAR.
[003:58:54;125] BUT WAIT A MINUTE!
[003:58:56;127] AREN'T THEY THE SAME TWO GUYS
[003:58:57;427] O.J. SIMPSON HIRED TO ARGUE JUST
[003:58:58;996] THE OPPOSITE, THAT THE D.N.A.
[003:59:00;798] TESTS ARE NOT DEFINITIVE WHEN
[003:59:02;033] THEY'RE USED TO NAIL SOMEO?
[003:59:05;836] >> Scheck: THIS IS GOING TO BE
[003:59:06;570] TRIAL BY FORENSIC AMBUSH.
[003:59:08;139] >> Stahl: SCHECK AND NEUFELD SAY
[003:59:09;073] IT'S EASY TO USE D.N.A. TESTING
[003:59:10;708] TO PROVE SOMEONE IS INNOCENT,
[003:59:12;176] BECAUSE IF JUST ONE GENETIC
[003:59:13;678] MARKER DOESN'T MATCH, YOU'VE GOT
[003:59:14;444] THE WRONG GUY.
[003:59:18;049] BUT THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW
[003:59:19;884] ABSOLUTELY THAT YOU'VE GOT THE
[003:59:20;951] RIGHT GUY IS TO SHOW THAT THE
[003:59:21;686] ENTIRE D.N.A. MATCHES.
[003:59:25;522] ALL 50,000 GENES WLD HAVE TO
[003:59:26;256] BE IDENTICAL.
[003:59:27;958] BUT IN D.N.ATESTING,
[003:59:29;760] SCIENTISTS LIKE DR. BING LOOK AT
[003:59:30;895] ONLY A SMALL SAMPLING OF THOSE
[003:59:31;628] GENES.
[003:59:33;630] HOW MANY DO YOU USUALLY LOOK AT?
[003:59:35;098] >> Bing: WE TRY FOR FIVE.
[003:59:36;132] >> Stahl: FIVE?
[003:59:37;267] >> Bing: WE TRY FOR FIVE.
[003:59:38;502] >> Stahl: SO IF HE MATCHED UP IN
[003:59:40;937] FOUR OTHER PLACES, THEN YOU
[003:59:42;138] WOULD SAY THAT THE CHANCES THAT
[003:59:43;707] HE DID IT ARE...?
[003:59:46;109] >> Bing: ONE OUT OF TWO MILLION
[003:59:46;876] PEOPLE.
[003:59:47;377] >> Stahl: ONE OUT OF TWO
[003:59:48;011] MILLION.
[003:59:48;745] >> Bing: ONE OUT OF TWO MILLION.
[003:59:49;979] >> Stahl: WHAT DR. BING MEANS IS
[003:59:51;582] THAT THE CHANCES TWO DIFFERENT
[003:59:52;949] PEOPLE HAVE FIVE IDENTICAL
[003:59:54;050] MARKERS IS ONE IN TWO MILLION.
[003:59:57;721] SO IN TRYING TO PROVE GUILT,
[003:59:59;489] FORENSIC SCIENTISTS DO NOT SAY,
[004:00:00;257] "SO-AND-SO DID THE CRIME."
[004:00:04;261] INSTEAD, THEY USE STATISTICS AND
[004:00:05;462] TALK ABOUT THE PROBABILITY THAT
[004:00:07;664] THE D.N.A. FROM THE CRIME SCENE
[004:00:08;432] CAME FROM THE SUSPECT.
[004:00:11;468] IN THE O.J. SIMPSON CASE, SCHECK
[004:00:13;270] AND NEUFELD ARE EXPECTED TO
[004:00:14;871] ARGUE THAT THE LABS THROW AROUND
[004:00:15;639] EXAGGERATED STATISTICS.
[004:00:19;042] HOW RELIABLE, IN YOUR OPINION,
[004:00:19;776] ARE THESE TESTS?
[004:00:21;845] >> James Wooley: EXTREMELY
[004:00:22;512] RELIAB.
[004:00:23;813] >> Stahl: ASSISTANT U.S.
[004:00:24;715] ATTORNEY JAMES WOOLEY HAS
[004:00:25;782] BATTLED AGAINST SCHECK AND
[004:00:26;450] NEUFELD AND WON.
[004:00:28;652] HE SAYS MOST PROSECUTORS BELIEVE
[004:00:30;053] THE TESTS ARE ACCURATE.
[004:00:32;489] >> Wooley: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
[004:00:34;224] D.N.A. TESTING IN THIS COUNTRY,
[004:00:35;892] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LITERALLY
[004:00:37;961] THOUSANDS OF CASES THAT HAVE
[004:00:38;895] ALREADY GONE ON WHERE IT'S BEEN
[004:00:40;696] USED, AND IT'S NEVER BEEN SHOWN
[004:00:42;665] TO FALSELY IMPLICATE AN INNOCENT
[004:00:43;432] PERSON.
[004:00:47;503] THE PEOPLE THAT LIKE D.N.A. ARE
[004:00:49;171] THE POLICE, THE VICTS, THE
[004:00:50;473] PROSECUTORS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR
[004:00:51;641] THE TRUTH.
[004:00:54;310] THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S GOT TO
[004:00:55;811] WORRY ABOUT THE D.N.A. TEST
[004:00:56;812] BEING DONE IN A CRIMINAL CASE IS
[004:00:57;680] THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THE
[004:00:58;381] CRIME.
[004:00:59;715] >> Stahl: BUT PETER NEUFELD
[004:01:00;683] CLAIMS THAT THE LABS THAT DO THE
[004:01:01;450] TESTS MAKE MISTAKES.
[004:01:04;620] >> Neufeld: WHAT GOT BARRY AND
[004:01:05;788] ME INTERESTED IN THIS WHOLE
[004:01:07;122] D.N.A. AND THIS WHOLE FORENSIC
[004:01:08;391] ISSUE IS FOR THESE CRIME LABS,
[004:01:09;124] IT'S LIKE THE WILD WEST.
[004:01:10;593] THERE IS NO REGULATION.
[004:01:11;727] THERE IS NO LICENSING.
[004:01:12;861] IF MEDICAL LABORATORIES WERE
[004:01:14;397] TREATED THE SAME WAY AS THE
[004:01:16;265] CRIME LABORATORIES THAT WE DEAL
[004:01:17;600] WITH, YOU WOULD HAVE A NATION
[004:01:19;368] WHERE HALF THE POPULATION IS
[004:01:21;069] HOSPITALIZED AND THE OTHER HALF
[004:01:22;137] IS SUING, AND THAT'S JUST
[004:01:22;805] COMPLETELY INTOLERABLE.
[004:01:26;676] >> Stahl: SCHECK AND NEUFE SAY
[004:01:27;643] THAT THESE LABS SHOULD BE
[004:01:28;778] REGULATED.
[004:01:29;779] DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
[004:01:31;180] ULDN'T THAT END THIS WHOLE
[004:01:32;247] DEBATE?
[004:01:33;316] >> Wooley: LOOK, IF YOU BELIEVE
[004:01:34;817] THAT SATISFYING ANY ONE OR TWO
[004:01:36;018] OF THEIR CRITICISMS WILL END THE
[004:01:37;353] DEBATE, YOU REALLY ARE IGNORING
[004:01:38;220] WHAT THEIR JOBS ARE.
[004:01:41;223] >> Stahl: TO KEEP THE DEBATE
[004:01:41;924] GOING.
[004:01:42;858] >> Wooley: THEIR JOBS ARE TO
[004:01:43;559] ZEALOUSLY ADVOCATE THE INTERESTS
[004:01:44;327] OF THEIR CLIENT.é
[004:01:47;129] IF IT EXONERATES THEIRLIENT,
[004:01:48;464] THEY WILL COME TO COURT AND SAY,
[004:01:50;199] "THIS IS A POWERFUL RESULT.
[004:01:52;567] PLEASE ACCEPT THIS EVEN THOUGH
[004:01:53;802] IT'S FROM MY BUNGLING,
[004:01:55;103] UNCERTIFIED LABORATORY," ALL
[004:01:56;338] RIGHT?
[004:01:59;041] IF IT IMPLICATES THEM, THEY
[004:01:59;741] CHALLENGE IT.
[004:02:02;577] >> Stahl: DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
[004:02:03;712] GOING INTO COURT AND ARGUING
[004:02:06;581] THAT D.N.A. HAS FOUND SOMEONE
[004:02:07;950] INNOCENT, AND GOING INTO COURT
[004:02:09;684] AND ARGUING THAT THE PROSECUTION
[004:02:11;153] CAN'T USE D.N.A. TO PROVE
[004:02:13;755] SOMEONE DID IT?
[004:02:15;690] >> Scheck: NO, BECAUSE...
[004:02:16;892] >> Stahl: IS THERE NO
[004:02:17;559] INCONSISTENCY, NO CONFLICT?
[004:02:19;061] >> Seck: FROM THE VERY
[004:02:20;628] BEGINNING, THERE HASN'T BEEN AN
[004:02:22;030] INCONSISTENCY, SCIENTIFICALLY,
[004:02:23;932] WITH THAT POSITION, BECAUSE
[004:02:25;234] FRANKLY, ALL THAT WE'RE ASKING
[004:02:26;468] IS THAT D.N.A. TESTING BE DONE
[004:02:27;435] CORRECTLY.
[004:02:29;537] IT'S JUST THAT WE WANT LICENSING
[004:02:30;305] OF THE LABORATORIES.
[004:02:32;407] >> Stahl: NO, BUT YOU DON'T...
[004:02:33;641] YOUR ARGUMENT IS THAT YOU WANT
[004:02:35;777] THE LABS THAT ARE GOING TO PROVE
[004:02:37;079] SOMEONE DID SOMETHING TO BE
[004:02:37;779] PERFECT.
[004:02:40;983] >> Scheck: NO, NO.
[004:02:41;616] IT'S THE SAME LABORATORY, SAME
[004:02:42;351] LABORATORIES.
[004:02:43;618] >> Stahl: BUT THE LABS YOU USE
[004:02:44;353] DON'T HAVE REGULATIONS, EITHER.
[004:02:45;187] NO LABS HAVE REGULATIONS.
[004:02:46;621] >> Scheck: WELL, THAT'S
[004:02:47;522] UNFORTUNATE, AND THAT'S WRONG.
[004:02:48;590] >> Stahl: THEY THINK ALL D.N.A.
[004:02:50;025] TESTING SHOULD BE DOUBLE-CHECKED
[004:02:51;260] BY BOTH THE PROSECUTION AND THE
[004:02:52;027] DEFENSE, WHENEVER POSSIBLE.
[004:02:55;463] THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
[004:02:56;698] BRIAN PIESZCZEK CASE, AND AT A
[004:02:58;000] RECENT HEARING, HE GOT THE
[004:02:58;666] RESULTS.
[004:03:01;303] >> Man: THE COURT IS GOING TO
[004:03:02;570] VACATE THE CONVICTION, SET ASIDE
[004:03:03;772] THE DEFENDANT'S SENTENCE.
[004:03:04;839] >> Stahl: BRIAN PIESZCZEK WENT
[004:03:06;040] TO PRISON WHEN HE WAS 23.
[004:03:08;710] HE WAS RELEASED ON HIS 27th
[004:03:09;411] BIRTHDAY.
[004:03:12;380] HE TOLD US, "D.N.A. IS GOD'S
[004:03:13;080] WORD."
[004:03:15;283] >> Pieszczek: I BELIEVE IN THE
[004:03:16;017] D.N.A.
[004:03:18;286] IT'S THE ULTIMATE, ULTIMATE
[004:03:19;320] WORD, THE TRUTH, IN MY OPINION.
[004:03:22;791] >> Stahl: BUT IN CASES LIKE O.J.
[004:03:23;558] SIMPSON'S, WHAT PROSECUTORS CALL
[004:03:24;992] THEIR MOST POWERFUL TOOL MAY NOT
[004:03:25;760] BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE A JURY.
[004:03:30;398] >> Wooley: THERE HAVE BEEN CASES
[004:03:31;466] WHERE PEOPLE HAVE PRESENTED
[004:03:33;000] D.N.A. TESTING THAT APPEARED TO
[004:03:35;136] BE RELIABLE, AND DEFENDANTS HAVE
[004:03:36;471] BEEN ACQUITTED DESPITE THE FACT
[004:03:37;238] THE D.N.A. SUGGESTED OTHERWISE.
[004:03:40;875] >> Stahl: SO A GOOD DEFENSE
[004:03:42;243] LAWYER CAN EVEN BEAT THIS
[004:03:43;812] INCREDIBLY RELIABLE TEST?
[004:03:45;780] >> Wooley: A GOOD DEFENSE LAWYER
[004:03:46;815] CAN BEAT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING,
[004:03:47;849] INCLUDING THIS, YEAH.
[004:03:52;386] >> ED HONECKER WAS PARDONED BY
[004:03:56;825] VIRGINIA' GOVERNOR OB ON THE
[004:03:57;525] BASIS OF HIS D.N.A. TEST, AND HE
[004:03:58;760] WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON.
