Foreword 


This  volume  is  one  in  a  continuing  series  of  books  prepared 
by  the  Federal  Research  Division  of  the  Library  of  Congress 
under  the  Country  Studies/Area  Handbook  Program  spon- 
sored by  the  Department  of  the  Army.  The  last  two  pages  of  this 
book  list  the  other  published  studies. 

Most  books  in  the  series  deal  with  a  particular  foreign  coun- 
try, describing  and  analyzing  its  political,  economic,  social,  and 
national  security  systems  and  institutions,  and  examining  the 
interrelationships  of  those  systems  and  the  ways  they  are 
shaped  by  historical  and  cultural  factors.  Each  study  is  written 
by  a  multidisciplinary  team  of  social  scientists.  The  authors 
seek  to  provide  a  basic  understanding  of  the  observed  society, 
striving  for  a  dynamic  rather  than  a  static  portrayal.  Particular 
attention  is  devoted  to  the  people  who  make  up  the  society, 
their  origins,  dominant  beliefs  and  values,  their  common  inter- 
ests and  the  issues  on  which  they  are  divided,  the  nature  and 
extent  of  their  involvement  with  national  institutions,  and  their 
attitudes  toward  each  other  and  toward  their  social  system  and 
political  order. 

The  books  represent  the  analysis  of  the  authors  and  should 
not  be  construed  as  an  expression  of  an  official  United  States 
government  position,  policy,  or  decision.  The  authors  have 
sought  to  adhere  to  accepted  standards  of  scholarly  objectivity. 
Corrections,  additions,  and  suggestions  for  changes  from  read- 
ers will  be  welcomed  for  use  in  future  editions.

Acknowledgments 


The  book  editor  would  like  to  thank  the  chapter  authors  for 
reviewing  and  commenting  on  various  chapters.  Their  country 
expertise  contributed  greatly  to  the  overall  quality  of  the  book. 
Frank  D.  McCann,  in  particular,  volunteered  his  expertise  in 
Brazilian  military  history  in  the  form  of  five  subsections  for  the 
National  Security  chapter.  The  book  editor  would  also  like  to 
thank  Professor  Roberto  Patricio  Korzeniewicz  of  the  Depart- 
ment of  Sociology  at  the  University  of  Maryland  at  College 
Park  for  contributing  the  discussion  of  gender  in  chapter  2, 
The  Society  and  Its  Environment. 

The  authors  are  grateful  to  individuals  in  various  agencies  of 
the  United  States  government,  international  organizations,  pri- 
vate institutions,  including  nongovernmental  organizations 
(NGOs)  in  Brazil,  and  Brazilian  diplomatic  offices  who  offered 
their  time,  special  knowledge,  or  research  facilities  and  materi- 
als to  provide  information  and  perspective.  None  of  these  indi- 
viduals, is,  however,  in  any  way  responsible  for  the  work  or 
points  of  view  of  the  authors. 

The  book  editor  would  like  to  thank  the  Rio  Office  of  the 
Library  of  Congress — particularly  Carmen  Muricy,  Senior 
Acquisitions  Specialist;  Pamela  Howard-Reguindin,  Field  Direc- 
tor; and  James  C.  Armstrong,  former  Field  Director — for  their 
bibliographical  and  other  assistance.  Thanks  also  go  to  Robert 
J.  Olson,  Department  of  the  Army,  for  his  efforts  on  behalf  of 
the  Country  Studies/Area  Handbook  Program. 

In  addition,  the  book  editor  would  like  to  thank  members  of 
the  Federal  Research  Division  who  contributed  directly  to  the 
preparation  of  the  manuscript.  These  include  Sandra  W.  Med- 
itz,  who  reviewed  all  textual  and  graphic  materials,  served  as 
liaison  with  the  sponsoring  agency,  and  provided  numerous 
substantive  and  technical  contributions;  Marilyn  L.  Majeska, 
who  managed  editing  and  production;  Andrea  T.  Merrill,  who 
edited  the  tables,  figures,  and  bibliography;  and  Barbara  Edg- 
erton,  Janie  L.  Gilchrist,  and  Izella  Watson,  who  did  the  word 
processing  and  initial  typesetting.  Thanks  also  go  to  Mary  Ann 
Saour,  who  performed  the  copyediting  of  the  chapters;  Cissie 
Coy,  who  performed  the  final  prepublication  editorial  review; 
Stephen  C.  Cranton  and  Janie  L.  Gilchrist,  who  prepared  the 


v 


camera-ready  copy;  and  Sandi  Schroeder,  who  compiled  the 
index. 

David  P.  Cabitto  provided  graphics  support,  including 
design  of  the  cover  and  chapter  illustrations.  He  was  assisted  by 
the  firm  of  Maryland  Mapping  and  Graphics,  which  prepared 
the  book's  maps  and  charts  based  on  the  editor's  drafts. 

The  cover  illustration  is  based  on  a  nineteenth-century  illus- 
tration from  Antonio  Bento,  Abstrafdo  na  arte  dos  indios 
brasileiros,  Rio  de  Janeiro:  SPALA  Editora,  1979.  The  chapter 
illustrations  are  based  on  nineteenth-century  Amazon  Indian 
wood-carving  designs  reproduced  in  Theodore  Menten,  ed., 
Amazon  Indian  Designs  from  Brazilian  and  Guianan  Wood  Carv- 
ings, New  York:  Dover,  1994. 

Finally,  the  book  editor  acknowledges  the  generosity  of  the 
individuals  and  the  public,  private,  diplomatic,  and  interna- 
tional agencies — particularly  the  Inter-American  Development 
Bank  and  the  Office  of  the  Military  Attache  of  the  Brazilian 
Embassy  in  Washington — who  allowed  their  photographs  to  be 
used  in  this  study.

Preface 


Like  its  predecessor,  published  in  1983,  this  study  is  an 
attempt  to  examine  objectively  and  concisely  the  dominant  his- 
torical, social,  environmental,  economic,  governmental,  politi- 
cal, and  national  security  aspects  of  contemporary  Brazil.  This 
new  edition  also  includes  a  chapter  on  science  and  technology. 
Sources  of  information  included  books,  journals,  other  period- 
icals and  monographs,  official  reports  of  governments  and 
international  organizations,  and  numerous  interviews  by  the 
authors  with  Brazilian  government  officials  and  experts  in  aca- 
demia  and  nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs)  in  Brazil. 

Chapter  bibliographies  appear  at  the  end  of  the  book;  brief 
comments  on  sources  recommended  for  further  reading 
appear  at  the  end  of  each  chapter.  To  the  extent  possible, 
place-names  follow  the  system  adopted  by  the  United  States 
Board  on  Geographic  Names  (BGN).  Measurements  are  given 
in  the  metric  system;  a  conversion  table  is  provided  to  assist 
readers  unfamiliar  with  metric  measurements  (see  table  1, 
Appendix).  A  glossary  is  also  included. 

The  body  of  the  text  reflects  information  available  as  of 
April  1997.  Certain  other  portions  of  the  text,  however,  have 
been  updated.  The  Introduction  discusses  significant  events 
that  have  occurred  since  the  completion  of  research,  the  Coun- 
try Profile  includes  updated  information  as  available,  and  the 
Bibliography  lists  recently  published  sources  thought  to  be  par- 
ticularly helpful  to  the  reader.

Size  and  Location:  Standard  figure  is  8,511,996  square 


xxxiii 


kilometers  (including  oceanic  islands  of  Arquipelago  de 
Fernando  de  Noronha,  Atol  das  Rocas,  Ilha  da  Trindade,  Ilhas 
Martin  Vaz,  and  Penedos  de  Sao  Pedro  e  Sao  Paulo). 
According  to  revised  figure  of  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography 
and  Statistics  (Fundacao  Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Geografia  e 
Estatistica — IBGE),  which  takes  into  account  new 
measurements,  total  area  is  8,547,403.5  square  kilometers. 
Brazil  occupies  about  47  percent  of  continental  area.  Country 
situated  between  05°16'20M  north  latitude  and  33°44'32"  south 
latitude,  and  between  34°47'30"  east  longitude  and  73059'32" 
west  longitude.  Its  boundaries  extend  23,086  kilometers,  of 
which  7,367  kilometers  on  Atlantic  Ocean.  To  north,  west,  and 
south,  Brazil  shares  boundaries  with  all  South  American 
countries  except  Chile  and  Ecuador. 

Standard  Time:  With  an  east-to-west  territorial  dimension  of 
4,319  kilometers,  Brazil  has  four  time  zones.  In  most  of 
country,  time  is  three  hours  earlier  than  Greenwich  time. 
Between  summer  months  of  October  and  February,  country 
adopts  daylight  savings  time,  setting  clock  forward  by  one  hour, 
in  Southeast  (Sudeste),  Center-West  (Centro-Oeste),  and 
South  (Sul)  regions,  and  in  states  of  Bahia  in  Northeast 
(Nordeste)  and  Tocantins  in  North  (Norte). 

Maritime  Claims:  Exclusive  economic  zone  322  kilometers 
(200  nautical  miles). 

Boundary  Disputes:  A  short  section  of  boundary  with  Paraguay, 
just  west  of  Salto  das  Sete  Quedas  (Guaira  Falls)  on  Parana; 
and  two  short  sections  of  boundary  with  Uruguay — Arroio 
Invernada  area  of  Cuareim  and  islands  at  confluence  of  Quarai 
and  Uruguai. 

Topography  and  Climate:  Consisting  of  dense  forest,  semiarid 
scrub  land,  rugged  hills  and  mountains,  rolling  plains,  and 
long  coastal  strip,  Brazil's  landmass  dominated  by  Amazon 
Basin  and  Central  Highlands.  Principal  mountain  ranges 
(Serra  do  Mar)  parallel  Atlantic  coast.  Climate  varies  from 
mostly  tropical  in  North,  where  it  is  seldom  cold,  to  more 
temperate  in  South,  where  it  snows  in  some  places.  Also  wide 
range  of  subtropical  variations.  World's  largest  rain  forest 
located  in  Amazon  Basin.  Higher  annual  measurements  (26°C 
to  28°C)  occur  in  Northeast's  interior  and  mid-  and  lower 
Amazon  River.  Lowest  values  (under  18°C)  occur  in  hilly  areas 
of  Southeast  and  largest  part  of  South.  Highest  absolute  values, 
over  40°C,  are  recorded  in  Northeast's  low  interior  lands;  in 


xxxiv 


Southeast's  depressions,  valleys,  and  lowlands;  in  Center-West's 
Pantanal  (Great  Wetlands)  and  lower  areas;  and  in  South's 
central  depressions  and  Uruguai  Valley.  Lowest  absolute 
temperatures  often  show  negative  values  in  most  of  South, 
where  frosts  and  snow  usual.  Rainy  areas  correspond  to  Para's 
coastal  lands  and  western  Amazonas,  where  annual  rainfall 
greater  than  3,000  millimeters.  In  Southeast  on  Serra  do  Mar 
(Sao  Paulo  State),  recorded  annual  rainfall  exceeds  3,500 
millimeters.  Drought  areas  located  in  interior  Northeast,  where 
annual  rainfall  under  500  millimeters.  Maximum  precipitation 
occurs  during  summer-autumn  in  most  parts  of  country,  except 
for  Roraima  and  north  Amazonas,  where  rainy  season  occurs 
during  winter  because  these  two  states  are  located  in  Northern 
Hemisphere. 

Principal  Rivers:  Vast,  dense  drainage  system  consisting  of 
eight  hydrographic  basins.  Amazon  and  Tocantins-Araguaia 
basins  account  for  56  percent  of  total  drainage  area.  World's 
greatest  fluvial  island,  Bananal,  located  in  Center-West  Region 
on  Araguaia.  With  ten  of  world's  twenty  greatest  rivers,  Amazon 
(Amazonas)  is  world's  largest  in  volume  of  water  and  one  of 
world's  longest  (6,762  kilometers,  of  which  3,615  kilometers 
are  in  Brazil),  discharging  15.5  percent  of  all  fresh  water 
flowing  into  oceans  from  rivers.  Union  of  Parana  and  Iguacu  in 
South,  at  border  between  Brazil,  Argentina,  and  Paraguay, 
forms  Iguacu  Falls  at  Foz  do  Iguacu.

North,  11.1  million;  and  Center-West,  10.2  million.  Average 
annual  population  growth  rate:  1.4  percent  (1992-98),  as 
compared  with  3.15  percent  in  1950-55.  Urbanization  rate:  80 
percent  (1997).  Projected  169  million  population  in  2000  and 
200.3  million  in  2020.  Population  density,  18.38  people  per 
square  kilometer  (1996),  although  majority  crowd  around 
coastal  cities. 

Age  Structure  and  Aging:  Although  nearly  half  of  Brazilians  are 
in  their  mid-twenties,  fraction  under  fourteen  years  of  age  has 
fallen  from  43  percent  to  34  percent,  while  fraction  over  sixty 
years  of  age  has  risen  from  4  percent  to  8  percent.  Median  age:

Birthrate:  21.16  births  per  1,000  population  (1995  estimate). 
Average  for  1990-95:  24.6. 

Death  Rate:  Eight  deaths  per  1,000  population  (1995 
estimate).  Average  for  1990-95:  7.5. 

Net  Migration  Rate:  Zero  migrant(s)  per  1,000  population 
(1995  estimate). 

Infant  Mortality  Rate:  According  to  1991  census,  49.7  deaths 
per  1,000  live  births,  as  compared  with  69.1  per  1,000  in  1980. 
United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  figures:  57 
per  1,000  in  1993;  59.5  per  1,000  in  1994.  Rate  in  Northeast  in 
1995:  122  deaths  per  1,000  live  births. 

Life  Expectancy  at  Birth:  In  1995,  67.1  years  (men,  62.1; 
women,  68.9).  Seniors  over  sixty  years  numbered  10.9  million 
in  1995,  or  7.4  percent  of  the  population. 

Total  Fertility  Rate:  About  2.3  children  born  per  woman  (1995 
average  estimate).  Population  growth  curtailed  sharply  since 
1975  with  one  of  world's  most  successful  family  planning 
drives.  Female  sterilization  (tubal  ligation)  and  birth-control 
pills  most  common  forms  of  contraception:  27  percent  of 
women  of  child-bearing  age  have  been  sterilized,  and  26 
percent  use  birth-control  pills.  According  to  the  new  Family 
Planning  Law  of  January  12,  1996,  family  planning  is  right  of 
every  citizen. 

Health:  Public  expenditures  on  health  as  percentage  of  GDP: 
2.5  percent  (1995).  Central  government  health  expenditures 
as  percentage  of  total  central  government  expenditures:  6.7 
percent.  Total  health  expenditures  as  percentage  of  GDP:  5.8 
percent.  Physicians  per  10,000  people:  13  (1990).  Nurses  per 
10,000:  3.7  (1990).  Hospital  beds  per  1,000  people:  3.6  (1990). 
Maternal  mortality  rate:  141  per  100,000  live  births  (1994). 
Mortality  rate  for  cancer  among  women:  60  percent  (1995). 
Cholera  cases:  49,956  (1993),  as  compared  with  30,054  in  1992. 
Malaria  cases:  577,098  (1991).  Cumulative  cases  of  acquired 
immune  deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  reported  to  PAHO/ 
WHO  as  of  September  1997:  10,845  (fourth  highest  rate  in 
world);  total  AIDS  deaths:  54,813.  Human  immunodeficiency 


xxx  vi 


virus  (HIV)  estimated  prevalence  in  1994:  550,000. 

Housing  and  Sanitation:  Country  has  serious  problems 
resulting  from  growing  demand  for  new  housing  and  basic 
sanitation,  in  part  because  urbanization  rate  has  increased 
from  47.0  percent  in  1960  to  78.2  percent  in  1991.  In  1991, 
70.7  percent  of  Brazilian  households  served  by  public  water 
supply  system,  with  92.2  percent  having  indoor  plumbing 
equipment.  In  urban  areas,  95  percent  of  dwellings  receive 
water  and  sewerage  service,  and  98  percent  have  electric  power. 
Discrepancies,  such  as  inadequate  sanitation,  exist  between 
poor  and  better-off  favelas.  Disposal  systems  cover  84  percent 
of  urban  areas  and  32  percent  of  rural  areas.  In  rural  areas, 
only  61  percent  of  dwellings  have  water  and  sewerage  access, 
and  only  55  percent  have  electricity.  Roughly  70  percent  of  all 
Brazilian  households  have  refrigerators.  Approximately  one 
installed  telephone  and  one  automobile  for  every  ten 
Brazilians. 

Ethnic  Groups:  Portuguese,  who  began  colonizing  in  sixteenth 
century,  and  various  European  immigrant  groups — mainly 
Germans,  Italians,  Spanish,  and  Polish — constitute  about  55 
percent;  mixed  Caucasian  and  African,  38  percent;  African 
(brought  to  Brazil  as  slaves),  about  6  percent;  and  others — 
Amerindian  (principally  Tupi  and  Guarani  linguistic  stock), 
Japanese,  and  other  Asians  and  Arabs — less  than  1  percent.  Sao 
Paulo  has  largest  Japanese  community  outside  Japan,  except 
for  Hawaii. 

Amerindians:  Indians  do  not  have  ownership  of  land  that  they 
occupy  permanently.  Brazil  has  651  Indian  reservations 
totaling  94.6  million  hectares.  Largest  is  Yanomami  (Amazonas 
and  Roraima  states),  with  9.6  million  hectares  and  a  popula- 
tion of  18,000  members.  Guarani  total  20,000  members. 

Language:  Portuguese,  official  language,  spoken  by  all  but  few 
isolated  Amerindians,  who  retain  their  languages,  and 
immigrants  who  have  not  yet  acquired  proficiency  in 
Portuguese.  There  are  no  official  regional  dialects.  Brazil  only 
Portuguese-speaking  country  in  South  America. 

Education:  Investment  in  education  (as  percentage  of 
government  budget):  2.7  percent  (1995).  Education  system 
organized  on  three  levels:  primary  (eight  years),  secondary 
(three  years),  and  higher  education.  States  and  municipalities 
largely  responsible  for  primary  education;  states  control 


xxxvii 


secondary  education;  private  institutions  largely  administer 
higher  education,  except  for  federal  universities.  School 
enrollment  figures  reported  in  last  census  (1990)  were: 
preschool,  3.9  million  in  57,614  schools;  primary,  29.4  million 
in  206,817  schools;  and  secondary,  3.7  million  in  10,928 
schools.  Primary  school  free  and  compulsory  for  children 
between  ages  of  seven  and  fourteen.  Average  student  in 
Brazilian  public  school  receives  four  hours  or  less  of  class  time 
per  day,  although  national  guidelines  suggest  six  hours  per  day. 
Primary  and  secondary  schools  enroll  only  88  percent  of 
Brazil's  children.  High  drop-out  rates  and  grade  repetition 
endemic  problems.  Only  about  a  third  of  students  enrolled  in 
primary  school  finish  eight-year  "mandatory"  schooling. 
Estimated  5  million  children  and  25  percent  of  poorest 
children  do  not  attend  school.  Of  sixty-eight  major  universities 
in  Brazil,  thirty-five  are  federal,  twenty  private  or  church- 
related,  two  municipal,  and  eleven  state-supported.  Nearly  all 
states  and  Federal  District  have  one  or  more  federal 
universities,  all  of  which  operate  directly  under  Ministry  of 
Education.  In  many  states,  there  are  also  one  or  more  state 
universities  and  one  or  more  Catholic  universities.  About  800 
other  colleges  and  institutions  of  higher  education  grant 
degrees  in  areas  such  as  engineering,  medicine,  agriculture, 
law,  economics,  and  business  administration.  Three  military 
academies  train  officers  of  Brazilian  Army  (Exercito 
Brasileiro),  Brazilian  Navy  (Marinha  do  Brasil),  and  Brazilian 
Air  Force  (Forca  Aerea  Brasileira — FAB),  granting  diplomas 
equivalent  to  a  B.A.  degree.  Only  army  and  FAB  schools  of 
engineering  grant  graduate  and  postgraduate  degrees. 

Literacy:  Of  total  number  of  Brazilians  over  fifteen  years  of  age 
(100.7  million),  81  percent  literate;  19  percent  illiterate  (1991 
census),  as  compared  with  a  25.9  percent  illiteracy  rate  in  1970. 
By  2000  illiteracy  will  be  estimated  16  percent. 

Religion:  Official  statistics:  Roman  Catholic,  70  percent; 
Protestant,  19.2  percent;  other,  10.8  percent.  Affiliations  not 
necessarily  mutually  exclusive.  Practice  of  folk  religions  and 
Afro-Brazilian  cults  based  on  animist  beliefs  and  slave  and 
Indian  traditions — such  as  umbanda  and  candomble — 
widespread  among  all  ethnic  groups.  Also  significant  trend  in 
evangelism  among  Catholic  and  Protestant  groups,  particularly 
in  Sao  Paulo  area.  Mormon  Church  of  Latter-Day  Saints  and 
Jehovah's  Witnesses  active  in  Brazil  as  well.  Important  Jewish 
communities  in  states  of  Sao  Paulo  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul, 


xxxviii 


especially  in  respective  capital  cities  of  Sao  Paulo  and  Porto 
Alegre,  as  well  as  in  Rio  de  Janeiro. 

Economy 

Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP):  Economist  Intelligence  Unit 
(EIU)  estimated  US$775  billion  for  1997,  as  compared  with 
US$387  billion  for  1992.  EIU's  estimated  GDP  real  growth  rate 
for  1997,  3.7  percent;  and  1998,  4.0  percent.  Of  1995  GDP  of 
US$717  billion,  47.3  percent  generated  by  trade  and  services, 
42.0  percent  by  industry,  and  10.7  percent  by  agriculture. 

Per  Capita  GDP  and  Minimum  Wage:  Per  capita  GDP  US$5,128 
(1997).  GDP  per  capita  average  annual  growth  rate,  0.8  per- 
cent (1985-94).  Minimum  wage  as  of  June  1995:  US$108.46,  or 
just  over  R$100  a  month  (for  value  of  real — see  Glossary),  as 
compared  with  US$68.93,  or  R$70  a  month,  in  July  1994, 
amounting  to  an  actual  increase  of  only  10  percent  because  of 
inflation.  Minimum  wage  raised  by  12  percent  in  May  1996. 

Inflation:  Inflation  reached  50  percent  per  month  by  June  1994 
and  averaged  31.2  percent  a  month  in  1994,  for  total  of  2,294.0 
percent  that  year.  As  result  of  Real  Plan,  declined  to  monthly 
rates  of  between  1  and  3  percent  in  1995,  for  an  annual  rate  of 
25.9  percent.  In  1996:  16.5  percent;  1997:  7.2  percent. 

Employment  and  Unemployment:  Estimated  labor  force  in 
1997:  65.5  million.  Services  sector  employed  66  percent  of 
women  and  42  percent  of  men;  industry,  14  percent  of  women 
and  23  percent  of  men;  business,  15  percent  of  women  and  15 
percent  of  men;  civil  construction,  11  percent  of  men;  other 
activities,  5  percent  of  women  and  9  percent  of  men.  Men  held 
61  percent  of  total  jobs.  Women's  wages  averaged  62  percent  of 
those  of  men  but  declined  to  54  percent  in  services  sector. 
Recorded  unemployment  rate  (includes  only  people  actively 
looking  for  work  and  over  age  fifteen)  in  1997:  5.5  percent. 

Agriculture:  One  of  world's  leading  exporters  of  agricultural 
products.  Grain  production  in  1996:  73  million  tons. 
According  to  estimates  of  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization 
(FAO)  of  United  Nations,  Brazil  produced  79.4  million  tons  of 
grains  (record  crop)  in  1995,  as  compared  with  56.1  million 
tons  in  1990.  Center-West  and  South  and  Rondonia  account  for 
90  percent  of  crops.  In  1995,  81.6  million  tons  of  crops  har- 
vested, but  producers  saw  their  income  reduced  by  about 
US$10.4  billion,  or  26  percent,  owing  to  price  decreases.

Country  has  46.5  million  hectares  under  cultivation,  174.1 
million  hectares  in  grazing  lands,  and  140.6  million  hectares  in 
arable  land.  Crop  year  runs  from  June  to  May.  From  1982  to 
1992,  total  cultivated  area  fell  by  30  percent,  but  production  of 
certain  grains,  in  tons  per  hectare,  increased  by  14.9  percent. 
Agricultural  sector  employed  29.4  percent  of  labor  force  in 
1992.  It  accounted  for  10.7  percent  of  GDP  in  1996.  It  accounts 
for  almost  40  percent  of  exports.  Except  for  wheat,  Brazil 
largely  self-sufficient  in  food.  Each  farmer  feeds  3.6  city 
dwellers,  whereas  2.5  farmers  were  needed  to  feed  each  city 
dweller  in  1940.  Brazil  is  world's  largest  exporter  of  coffee, 
orange  juice  concentrate,  and  tobacco,  and  second  largest 
exporter  of  sugar  and  soybeans.  In  addition  to  sugar,  Brazil 
produces  a  large  quantity  of  ethanol  (mainly  used  as  fuel)  from 
crushed  sugarcane.  Other  important  crops:  manioc,  corn,  and 
rice.  In  addition  to  oranges,  principal  fruits  are  lemons, 
mangoes,  guavas,  passion  fruit,  and  tangerines. 

Industry:  Capital  goods  (see  Glossary)  production  increased  in 
1970s  with  creation  of  new  companies  and  large  capital 
investments  in  transportation,  communications,  and  energy 
infrastructure.  New  technologically  sophisticated  industries 
begun  in  that  decade  included  weapons,  aircraft,  and 
computer  manufacturing  and  nuclear  power  production. 
Industrial  growth  slowed  by  economic  crisis  of  1980s.  After  start 
of  RealFlan,  industrial  production  increased  vigorously  by  7.5 
percent  from  1993  to  1994.  Manufacturing  accounted  for  62 
percent  of  exports  in  1996.  Industrial  growth  in  1997  was  3.9 
percent. 

Energy:  94  percent  of  current  energy  capacity  hydroelectric. 
Electricity  consumption  expanded  by  7.6  percent  in  1995 
(versus  4.2  percent  for  GDP)  and  by  5.7  percent  in  first  half  of 

1996  (versus  projected  GDP  growth  rate  of  3  percent).  A  dozen 
hydroelectric  and  thermal  plants  being  privatized  because 
electricity  demand  expected  to  outstrip  supply  by  1999,  and 
state  unable  to  pay  off  energy-sector  debts.  A  blackout  in  April 

1997  affecting  20  million  people  expected  to  become  an 
increasingly  common  occurrence.  Predominance  of  highland 
rivers  presents  great  potential  for  hydroelectric  power  pro- 
duction. Hydropower  generating  potential:  106,500  to  129,046 
megawatts /year,  of  which  24.4  percent  in  operation  or  under 
construction,  35.8  percent  inventoried,  and  39.8  percent  esti- 
mated (1994  estimate).  In  1992,  of  233,682  gigawatt-hours 
generated,  217,782  hydroelectric,  14,454  thermal,  and  1,446 


xl 


nuclear.  Nuclear  power  generation  in  early  1998  was  still 
negligible.  About  60  percent  of  energy  supply  derived  from 
renewable  sources,  such  as  hydroelectricity  and  ethanol. 
National  oil  production  surpassed  a  record  840,000  barrels  per 
day  (bpd)  in  1997.  Petroleum  imports  in  1995:  760,000  bpd 
(442,000  bpd  crude;  318,000  bpd  derivatives).  Brazil  relies  on 
natural  gas  for  only  2  percent  of  energy  needs.  Produced  more 
than  17  million  cubic  meters  of  natural  gas  per  day  in  early 
1990s. 

Services:  In  1994  services  accounted  for  approximately  43.6 
percent  of  work  force. 

Trade  Balance:  Total  trade  in  1997:  US$109.4  billion,  com- 
pared with  US$77.3  billion  in  1994.  In  ten  years,  1985-95, 
foreign  trade  of  Brazil  accounted  for  US$521.8  billion,  with 
surplus  of  US$129.3  billion.  Foreign  trade  deficit  in  1997: 
US$10.9  billion. 

Imports:  Totaled  US$60.1  billion  in  1997,  as  compared  with 
US$20.5  billion  in  1993.  Average  import  duties  dropped  to  14 
percent  from  51  percent  since  1988.  Major  suppliers  in  1996: 
United  States,  22.2  percent;  Germany,  9.0  percent;  Argentina, 
12.7  percent;  and  Japan,  5.2  percent.  Half  of  Brazil's  imports  of 
manufactured  goods  come  from  United  States.  Brazil  only 
other  major  Latin  American  country  besides  Chile  to  import 
oil,  which  in  1996  cost  an  estimated  US$6.4  billion. 

Exports:  Totaled  US$49.2  billion  in  1997,  as  compared  with 
US$39.6  billion  in  1993.  Brazil's  strengthened  currency  has 
made  its  exports  less  competitive.  Brazil  exports  large  part  of 
world's  production  of  tin,  iron,  manganese,  and  steel.  Also  one 
of  world's  largest  exporters  of  food,  mainly  sugar,  coffee, 
cocoa,  soybeans,  and  orange  juice.  Major  markets  in  1996: 
United  States,  19.5  percent;  Argentina,  10.8  percent;  Japan,  6.4 
percent;  and  the  Netherlands,  7.4  percent. 

Tariffs:  Average  tariff  rate:  14.0  percent;  tariff  ceiling:  70 
percent  on  automobiles  (imposed  in  mid-1995). 

Reserves:  International  reserves  in  first  quarter  of  1998:  US$63 
billion. 

Budget  Deficit:  Current  account  deficit  in  1997:  US$32.3 
billion.  EIU's  current  account  deficit  estimate  for  1998: 
US$33.6  billion. 

Internal  Debt:  Total  debt  of  public  sector  (federal,  state,  and 


xli 


municipal  governments):  US$77  billion  (1994).  Totaled  record 
US$213  billion  (36.8  percent  of  GDP)  in  1995,  according  to 
official  figures,  or  US$267  billion  (46  percent  of  GDP),  if  some 
unregistered  existing  debts  included.  IBGE  calculated  total 
domestic  debt  to  be  R$304.8  billion  in  September  1995,  or  60.9 
percent  of  estimated  1995  GNP.  Public  Sector  Borrowing 
Requirement  reached  5.6  percent  of  GDP  in  1996,  as 
compared  with  5.1  percent  in  1995. 

External  Debt:  US$1 77.6  billion  (public  and  private)  in  1997; 
US$193.2  billion  estimated  by  EIU  for  1998.  Total  debt  service: 
US$15  billion  (1996).  Debt-service  ratio:  58.7  percent  (1997). 

Official  Exchange  Rate:  On  July  1,  1994,  new  currency,  the  real 
(pi.,  reais),  introduced.  As  of  January  31,  1996,  government 
widened  to  7.07  percent  range  within  which  value  vis-a-vis 
United  States  dollar  may  vary.  Exchange  rate  on  April  13,  1998: 
R$1.140=US$1. 

Foreign  Investment:  US$52  billion  in  1996,  US$38  billion  in 
1995,  and  US$25  billion  in  1994. 

Fiscal  Year:  Calendar  year. 

Fiscal  Policy:  Stabilization  program  in  1994-96  developed 
originally  by  Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso  (president,  1995-  ) 
as  minister  of  finance  (May  1993  to  April  1994).  End  of 
inflation  in  1994  quickly  increased  demand  and  spending 
power  of  poorer  Brazilians  especially.  Government 
endeavoring  to  dampen  inflationary  pressures.  In  order  to 
consolidate  stabilization  program  and  put  Brazil  on  path  to 
long-term  sustainable  growth,  government  must  implement 
wide-ranging  structural  reforms.  Restrictive  monetary  policy 
has  kept  interest  rates  high  and  reduced  aggregate  demand 
and  inflation,  while  improving  trade  balance.  Fiscal  position 
deteriorated  considerably  in  1995.  Expansion  of  internal 
public  debt  a  major  threat  to  government's  control  over  fiscal 
and  monetary  policy.  Monetary  policy  somewhat  more  flexible 
since  August  1995  because  of  lower  level  of  economic  activity, 
declining  inflation  rate,  and  abundance  of  foreign  capital  to 
finance  current  account. 

Transportation  and  Communications 

Roads:  Since  1970s  government  has  given  funding  priority  to 
roads  and  highways.  Sao  Paulo,  Rio  de  Janeiro,  and  other 


xlii 


major  cities  have  modern  metropolitan  expressways.  Practically 
all  state  capitals  linked  by  paved  roads.  Brazilian  highways  of 
modern  design.  Road  network  most  developed,  but 
maintenance  remains  problem.  Highway  transportation  of 
passengers  and  freight  leading  form  of  transportation  in  Brazil, 
with  highway  system  1,670,148  kilometers  in  length  (increase 
of  more  than  300  percent  since  1970s),  of  which  161,503 
kilometers  paved.  At  least  three-fourths  of  Brazil's  population 
and  goods  transported  by  highway.  Although  Brazil  borders  all 
but  two  South  American  countries,  only  in  southern  regions 
are  links  to  adjoining  countries  adequate;  in  North  and  Center- 
West,  roads  to  adjoining  countries  barely  passable  or  only 
planned.  Large  areas  remain  inaccessible.  In  part  because  of 
general  disregard  of  traffic  laws,  automobile  collisions  claim 
lives  of  roughly  50,000  Brazilians  per  year,  and  drivers 
responsible  for  accidents  rarely  held  accountable.  New  Transit 
Code  took  effect  in  January  1998,  imposing  a  tough  new  set  of 
traffic  laws. 

Railroads:  Rail  network,  in  proportion  to  highways,  relatively 
small.  Rail  lines  cover  only  30,129  kilometers,  of  which  2,150 
kilometers  electrified.  However,  some  special  projects  have 
been  implemented,  such  as  Steel  Railroad  (Ferrovia  do  Aco)  to 
connect  inland  iron  ore  mining  areas  to  steel  mills  and  port 
facilities  on  Southeast's  coast.  Its  western  network  sold  to  a 
foreign  consortium  in  early  1996.  Federal  Railroad  System,  Inc. 
(Rede  Ferroviaria  Federal  S.A. — RFFSA)  has  operated  73 
percent  of  Brazil's  suburban  railroads,  with  21,951  kilometers 
of  track  and  40,500  employees  in  nineteen  states.  In  1995 
RFFSA  hauled  85  million  tons  of  cargo,  and  Southeastern 
Railroad  Line  accounted  for  45  million  tons.  Central-eastern 
network  7,132  kilometers;  western  network  1,620  kilometers. 
Privatization  of  financially  troubled  RFFSA  began  in  1995. 

Subways:  Recife,  Rio  de  Janeiro,  and  Sao  Paulo  have  new  urban 
subway  systems.  Although  Sao  Paulo  needs  a  200-kilometer

Radiobras)  in  198,8.  Radiobras  directs  programming. 

Television:  Number  of  televisions  increased  by  only  200,000 
from  1985  to  1995,  when  total  figure  reached  26.2  million. 
Estimated  potential  audience:  80  million.  TV  programming 
run  primarily  by  private  enterprises.  Licenses  to  operate  issued

Domestic  dissemination  of  signals  beamed  by  all  five  national 
networks  through  two  domestic  Brasilsat  satellites  operated  by 
Brazilian  Telecommunications  Company  (Empresa  Brasileira 
de  Telecomunicacoes — Embratel),  government's  national 
communications  corporation.  Embratel  also  operates  micro- 
wave system  available  to  all  stations.  Various  "cable"  systems  are 
also  being  developed  in  major  Brazilian  cities.  Rather  than 
actually  transmitting  by  physical  cable,  these  systems  work  via 
satellite  to  individual  receiving  dishes  installed  for  subscribers. 
NET  System,  being  installed  in  major  cities,  operates  by  cable. 
Every  major  television  market  in  Brazil  has  five  networks 
represented  by  affiliate  station.  Much  of  television  program- 
ming entertainment,  especially  famous  telenovelas  (prime-time 
soap-opera-style  dramas).  Most  cities  also  have  educational  TV 
channel,  TV  Educativa,  which  carries  cultural,  documentary, 
and  sometimes  foreign  language  programs. 

Telephones:  Number  of  telephones  13,237,852  (1995,  IBGE). 
About  half  of  telephones  and  one-third  of  installed  cellular 
phone  lines  in  Sao  Paulo.  Residents  of  Sao  Paulo  and  Rio  de 
Janeiro  must  pay  about  US$3,000  to  obtain  telephone  line. 
Nine  lines  per  100  population.  About  98  percent  of  rural 
properties  have  no  telephone  lines.  Government  plans  to  triple 
number  of  fixed  phone  lines  to  40  million  by  2003  and  to 
increase  number  of  cellular  links  from  800,000  to  8.2  million 
by  1999.  In  July  1996,  Brazilian  legislators  formulating  plans  to 
privatize  state-owned  monopoly  of  Brazilian  Telecommunica- 
tions (Telecomunicacoes  Brasileiras  S.A. — Telebras),  which  has 
90  percent  of  Brazilian  telephone  subscribers  and  twenty-seven 


xlv 


regional  companies.  Telebras  launched  three  cable  systems  but 
was  facing  stiff  competition  in  cable  market  from  publishing 
giants  Grupo  Abril  (TVA  Brasil)  and  Globo  (Globocabo  and 
NET  Brasil).  Sales  of  telecommunications  products  in  1995 
accounted  for  US$2.1  billion.  In  1997  Brazil  had  7,600  kilo- 
meters of  fiber  optic  cable;  additional  7,400  kilometers  sched- 
uled for  completion  in  1999. 

Telecommunications  Organizations:  Two  main  telecommu- 
nications organizations  are  National  Department  of  Telecom- 
munications (Departamento  Nacional  de  Telecomunicacoes — 
Dentel),  located  within  Ministry  of  Communications  in 
Brasilia;  and  Brazilian  Association  of  Radio  and  Television 
Stations  (Associacao  Brasileira  de  Emissoras  de  Radio  e 
Televisao — ABERT),  also  located  in  Brasilia.  Dentel  supervises 
television  and  radio  broadcasting.

Paulo-based  Agenda  Estado  and  Agenda  Folha. 

Government  and  Politics 

Administrative  Subdivisions:  Composed  of  5,581  municipalities 
(1997)  and  9,274  districts  (1995).  These  subdivisions  com- 


xlvi 


bined  into  twenty-six  states  and  Federal  District  of  Brasilia. 
These  states  and  Federal  District  form  five  major  regions: 
North,  including  states  of  Acre,  Amapa,  Amazonas,  Para, 
Rondonia,  Roraima,  and  Tocantins;  Northeast,  including 
Alagoas,  Bahia,  Ceara,  Maranhao,  Parafba,  Pernambuco,  Piaui, 
Rio  Grande  do  Norte,  and  Sergipe;  Southeast,  including 
Espirito  Santo,  Minas  Gerais,  Rio  de  Janeiro,  and  Sao  Paulo; 
South,  including  Parana,  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  and  Santa 
Catarina;  and  Center-West,  including  Federal  District,  Goias, 
Mato  Grosso,  and  Mato  Grosso  do  Sul.  North  Region,  country's 
largest,  covers  45.3  percent  of  national  territory;  Northeast, 
18.3  percent;  Southeast,  10.9  percent;  South,  smallest,  6.8  per- 
cent; and  Center-West,  18.9  percent.  Brasilia  seat  of  govern- 
ment, housing  executive,  legislative,  and  judicial  branches. 

Government:  Federative  republic  with  broad  powers  granted  to 
federal  government.  Constitution,  reenacted/revised  on 
October  5,  1988,  establishes  presidential  system  with  three 
branches — executive,  legislative,  and  judicial.  Chief  of  state 
and  head  of  government  is  president.  Fernando  Henrique 
Cardoso  won  1994  presidential  elections  in  first  round  on 
October  3,  taking  54  percent  of  vote,  and  assumed  office  on 
January  1,  1995.  President  assisted  by  vice  president  (elected 
with  president)  and  presidentially  appointed  and  headed 
cabinet.  Cardoso  may  stand  for  reelection  in  1998.  Bicameral 
National  Congress  (Congresso  Nacional)  consists  of  Federal 
Senate  (Senado  Federal),  with  eighty-one  members  (three  for 
each  state  and  Federal  District)  popularly  elected  to  eight-year 
terms,  and  Chamber  of  Deputies  (Camara  dos  Deputados), 
with  513  members  popularly  elected  to  four-year  terms. 
Elections  for  both  houses  simultaneous  and  based  on 
proportional  representation  weighted  in  favor  of  less  populous 
states.  Suffrage  compulsory  for  Brazilians  above  age  of 
eighteen.  Highest  court  Federal  Supreme  Court  (Supremo 
Tribunal  Federal — STF),  whose  eleven  justices,  including  chief 
justice,  appointed  by  president  to  serve  until  age  seventy.  Each 
state  has  own  judicial  system.  Federal  revenue-sharing 
program,  established  by  1988  constitution,  provides  states  with 
substantial  resources.  Framework  of  state  and  local 
government  similar  to  federal  government.  Governors  may 
stand  for  reelection  to  four-year  terms  in  1998.  Federal  District 
also  governed  by  governor  and  vice  governor.  Governors  have 
more  limited  powers  than  counterparts  in  United  States 
because  of  centralized  nature  of  Brazilian  system  and  1988 


xlvii 


constitution,  which  reserves  to  federal  government  all  powers 
not  specifically  delegated  to  states.  States  and  municipalities 
have  limited  taxing  authority. 

National  Election  Dates:  Presidential,  congressional,  and  state 
elections  occur  simultaneously  every  four  years  in  October  and 
November;  held  in  October-November  1994  and  scheduled 
for  1998  and  2002.  Dates  of  municipal  elections:  October- 
November  1996,  2000,  and  2004. 

Politics:  Returned  to  democratic  civilian  government  in  1985 
after  more  than  two  decades  of  military  rule  (1964-85). 
President  Fernando  Collor  de  Mello  elected  in  November  1989 
and  took  office  on  March  15,  1990,  first  directly  elected 
president  in  twenty-nine  years.  Chamber  of  Deputies 
impeached  Collor  in  September  1992  on  corruption  charges, 
and  he  was  removed  from  office  by  Senate  vote  that  December. 
His  vice  president,  Itamar  Franco,  then  assumed  presidency.  In 
October  1994,  Brazil  held  elections  for  presidency,  state 
governorships,  Chamber  of  Deputies,  and  two-thirds  of  Senate. 
Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso  (president,  1995-  )  gained 
election  on  strength  of  heterodox  alliance  between  his 
Brazilian  Social  Democracy  Party  (Partido  da  Social 
Democracia  Brasileira — PSDB)  and  two  center-right  parties, 
Liberal  Front  Party  (Partido  da  Frente  Liberal — PFL)  and 
Brazilian  Labor  Party  (Partido  Trabalhista  Brasileiro — PTB). 
Alliance  seen  at  time  as  strictly  electoral,  with  little  chance  of 
lasting  long  into  administration.  Thus  far,  it  has  remained 
intact,  with  Cardoso  adding  Brazil's  largest  party,  Brazilian 
Democratic  Movement  Party  (Partido  do  Movimento 
Democratico  Brasileiro — PMDB),  to  coalition  immediately 
after  election.  Rivalries  among  parties  for  plum  federal 
appointments  in  key  states  and  regions  have,  however,  plagued 
coalition,  as  has  factiousness  within  parties.  Congress  uses 
committee  system  much  like  United  States;  there  are  six  Senate 
committees  and  sixteen  House  committees.  A  notable 
distinction  is  absence  of  conference  committees  to  work  out 
differences  between  competing  legislative  texts;  instead,  bill 
modified  by  one  house  must  be  returned  to  originating  house 
for  up-or-down  vote  on  modifications.  Party  leaders  play  key 
role  in  setting  voting  agenda.  Also  important  are  "rapporteurs" 
for  individual  bills;  negative  rapporteur's  report  can  effectively 
kill  bill  before  it  reaches  committee  vote.  Since  Cardoso's  inau- 
guration, Congress  has  devoted  itself  largely  to  constitutional 
reform.  Each  constitutional  amendment  requires  approval  by 


xlviii 


margin  of  two-thirds,  twice  over,  in  each  house  (total  of  four 
votes).  Despite  obstacles,  Congress  has  moved  constitutional 
reform  forward  farther  and  faster  than  expected,  particularly 
in  economic  area. 

Political  Parties:  Fourteen  political  parties  span  most  of 
political  spectrum.  PMDB  (Brazilian  Democratic  Movement 
Party)  Brazil's  largest  party;  PFL  (Liberal  Front  Party)  is  second 
largest  party  and  largest  on  center-right;  PTB  (Brazilian  Labor 
Party)  is  populist  party  confined  to  several  western  states;  PSDB 
(Brazilian  Social  Democracy  Party)  includes  President  Cardoso 
and  espouses  a  center-left  social  democratic  agenda  and  free- 
market  economy  with  greater  involvement  in  health  care  and 
education;  Brazilian  Socialist  Party  (Partido  Socialista 
Brasileiro — PSB)  is  leftist  party;  Communist  Party  of  Brazil 
(Partido  Comunista  do  Brasil — PC  do  B)  still  has  Soviet-style 
platform.  Other  parties  include  Democratic  Social  Party 
(Partido  Democratico  Social — PDS)  and  Democratic  Labor 
Party  (Partido  Democratico  Trabalhista — PDT),  populist  party 
whose  leaders,  including  Leonel  de  Moura  Brizola,  stress 
greater  government  role  in  addressing  Brazil's  social  problems. 
Liberal  Party  (Partido  Liberal)  is  also  center-right  party, 
popular  among  small  businessmen  at  state  and  local  levels  in 
Sao  Paulo  and  Rio  de  Janeiro;  National  Reconstruction  Party 
(Partido  da  Reconstrucao  Nacional — PRN)  is  party  of  former 
President  Collor  de  Mello;  Popular  Socialist  Party  (Partido 
Popular  Socialista — PPS)  is  former  Brazilian  Communist  Party, 
renamed  in  1993;  Progressive  Party  (Partido  Progressista — PP) 
is  center-right  party  supporting  market-oriented  policies; 
Progressive  Renewal  Party  (Partido  Progressista  Renovador — 
PPR)  is  another  center-right  party  supporting  free-market 
reforms;  and  Workers'  Party  (Partido  dos  Trabalhadores — PT) 
is  European-style  leftist  party  headed  by  party  founder  Luis 
Inacio  "Lula"  da  Silva. 

Foreign  Relations:  Traditionally,  United  States-oriented  but 
foreign  policy  increasingly  diverse  and  pragmatic.  Foreign 
policy  dominated  by  trade  concerns.  Highly  active  and  pro- 
fessional Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  popularly  known  as 
Itamaraty.  Guiding  principles  of  Brazilian  diplomacy,  as 
defined  by  President  Cardoso,  involve  quest  for  greater 
democracy  in  international  relations  and  support  for  economic 
multilateralism  with  clear  and  defined  rules.  Defense  of 
principle  of  sustainable  development  (see  Glossary)  at  Rio  de 
Janeiro's  Earth  Summit  in  June  1992,  conclusion  in  1995  of 


xlix 


Uruguay  Round  of  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade 
(GATT — see  Glossary),  and  desire  for  permanent  seat  on 
United  Nations  Security  Council  all  part  of  these  basic 
objectives.  Parallel  regional  objectives  include  need  for  Brazil 
to  seek  regional  options  for  increasing  country's  bargaining 
power.  Brazilian  proposal  for  creation  of  South  American  Free 
Trade  Association  (SAFTA)  is  important  step  in  this  direction. 

International  Agreements  and  Membership:  Party  to  Inter- 
American  Treaty  of  Reciprocal  Assistance  of  1947  (Rio  Treaty) 
(see  Glossary),  Treaty  of  Tlatelolco  (see  Glossary),  and  Missile 
Technology  Control  Regime  (see  Glossary).  Until  June  20, 
1997,  Brazil  refused  to  sign  the  Nuclear  Nonproliferation 
Treaty  (NPT).  Memberships  in  international  organizations 
many  and  varied,  such  as  United  Nations  and  specialized 
agencies;  Organization  of  American  States  (see  Glossary)  and 
specialized  agencies;  regional  trade  and  cooperation 
organizations,  including  Common  Market  of  the  South  (Mer- 
cado  Comum  do  Sul — Mercosul;  see  Glossary);  international 
commodity  agreements;  and  multilateral  lending  institutions. 

National  Security 

Armed  Forces:  Total  active-duty  troops  and  officers:  314,700, 
including  132,000  conscripts  (1997).  Brazilian  Army  (Exercito

armed  forces  (as  percentage  of  government  budget):  1.7 
percent  (1995).  Except  1990,  military  spending  as  percentage 
of  federal  budget  has  declined  steadily  since  1985.  Fifth-ranked 
recipient  of  arms  transfer  agreements  of  developing  nations  in 


i

Introduction 


MORE  LIKE  A  CONTINENT  than  a  country,  the  Federative 
Republic  of  Brazil  (Republica  Federativa  do  Brasil)  is  geo- 
graphically larger  than  the  conterminous  United  States.  It  is 
the  world's  fifth  largest  nation  in  physical  size,  exceeded  only 
by  Russia,  China,  the  United  States,  and  Canada.  By  far  the 
largest  country  in  Latin  America,  Brazil  occupies  nearly  half 
the  land  mass  of  South  America  and  borders  every  South 
American  country  except  Chile  and  Ecuador.  With  90  percent 
of  its  territory  lying  between  the  equator  and  the  Tropic  of 
Capricorn,  Brazil  is  the  world's  largest  tropical  country.  The 
Amazon  Region  has  the  world's  largest  river  system;  the  Ama- 
zon is  the  source  of  20  percent  of  the  world's  fresh  water. 

Brazil's  history  prior  to  becoming  an  independent  country 
in  1822  is  intertwined  mainly  with  that  of  Portugal.  Unlike  the 
other  viceroyalties  of  Latin  America,  which  divided  into  twenty 
countries  upon  attaining  independence,  the  Viceroyalty  of  Bra- 
zil became  a  single  nation,  with  a  single  language  transcending 
all  diversities  and  regionalisms.  Brazil  is  the  only  Portuguese- 
speaking  Latin  American  country,  and  its  Luso-Brazilian  cul- 
ture differs  in  subtle  ways  from  the  Hispanic  heritage  of  most 
of  its  neighbors.  During  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth 
centuries,  millions  of  Italians,  Germans,  Arabs,  Japanese,  and 
other  immigrants  entered  Brazil  and  in  various  ways  altered  the 
dominant  social  system.  Their  descendants,  however,  are  nearly 
all  Portuguese-speaking  Brazilians. 

Except  for  a  small  indigenous  Indian  population,  Brazilians 
are  one  people,  with  a  single  culture.  Anthropologist  Darcy 
Ribeiro  attributes  a  "national  ethnicity"  to  Brazil's  melting-pot, 
disparate  population,  which  has  created  a  society  that  "knows 
itself,  feels,  and  behaves  as  a  single  people."  Unifying  forces 
that  have  strengthened  Brazilians'  sense  of  national  self-iden- 
tity include  the  nation's  multiracial  society  and  its  various  reli- 
gions; Brazilian  Portuguese,  music,  and  dance,  particularly  the 
samba  and,  more  recently,  Brazilian  funk,  a  wildly  popular  ver- 
sion of  the  musical  genres  known  in  the  United  States  as  rap 
and  hip-hop;  the  national  soccer  team,  which  won  the  World 
Cup  championship  for  the  fourth  time  in  1994;  Edson  Arantes 
do  Nascimento  (Pele),  widely  acknowledged  as  the  greatest 
soccer  player  ever,  who  won  three  World  Cups  with  Brazil  and 


liii 


was  declared  an  official  national  treasure  by  Brazil's  National 
Congress  (Congresso  Nacional;  hereafter,  Congress);  world- 
renowned  Brazilian  Formula  1  auto  racers,  such  as  Emerson 
Fittipaldi  and  the  late  Ayrton  Senna;  and  the  country's  televi- 
sion networks,  with  their  widely  viewed  soap  operas  called  tele- 
novelas.  Brazilian  social  scientists  have  used  the  concept  of 
homem  cordial  (cordial  man)  to  describe  the  Brazilian  arche- 
type. Brazilians  are  generally  a  friendly,  warm,  and  spontane- 
ous people. 

With  an  estimated  161  million  people  in  early  1998,  Brazil  is 
the  world's  largest  Roman  Catholic  nation,  and  its  population 
is  the  world's  sixth  largest.  By  2000  Brazil  will  have  an  estimated 
169  million  people.  Its  population  is  largely  urban;  the  urban- 
ization rate  soared  from  47  percent  in  1960  to  80  percent  in 
1996.  Even  the  Amazon  region  is  urbanized;  70  percent  of  its 
18  million  people  live  in  cities.  The  Amazonian  city  of  Manaus, 
which  still  lacks  a  sewerage  system  other  than  the  river,  now  has 
a  population  of  1.5  million  and  a  highway  to  Venezuela.  Brazil 
has  at  least  fourteen  cities  with  more  than  1  million  people. 
Greater  Rio  de  Janeiro's  population  totaled  10.3  million  in 
1995.  Greater  Sao  Paulo,  with  18.8  million  people,  is  the 
world's  third  largest  metropolitan  area,  after  Tokyo  and  Mexico 
City.  Although  Sao  Paulo's  Metro  is  clean  and  efficiently  moves 
more  people  in  one  day  than  Washington's  Metro  does  in  two 
months,  the  megacity  is  disorienting  and  suffers  from  extreme 
traffic  congestion  and  air  pollution.  To  alleviate  this  situation, 
Sao  Paulo  State  in  January  1998  revived  a  fifty-year-old  plan  to 
build  a  US$2.5  billion  beltway  around  the  city. 

The  growth  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Sao  Paulo  slowed  during 
the  1980s  and  early  1990s,  along  with  internal  migration.  More- 
over, Brazil's  demographic  growth  rate  fell  from  about  3  per- 
cent a  year  in  the  1960s  to  only  an  estimated  1.22  percent  in 
1995,  even  without  the  adoption  of  an  official  population-con- 
trol program.  During  this  three-decade  period,  Brazilian  fertil- 
ity rates  decreased  from  6.4  to  about  2.3  children  for  each 
woman.  The  country's  new  demographic  profile  shows  a  gener- 
ally young  population;  nearly  50  percent  of  Brazilians  are 
younger  than  age  twenty. 

Some  of  Brazil's  smaller  cities,  particularly  those  in  the  more 
developed  South  (Sul)  and  Southeast  (Sudeste),  have  fared 
better  than  its  megacities  in  their  innovative  approaches  to 
urban  ecology.  Curitiba,  the  capital  of  Parana,  has  earned  a 
worldwide  reputation  as  a  model  city,  not  only  for  the  develop- 


liv 


ing  world  but  also  the  developed  world,  thanks  to  its  former 
architect-mayor,  Jaime  Lerner  (now  governor  of  Parana).  In 
June  1996,  the  chairman  of  the  Habitat  II  summit  of  mayors 
and  urban  planners  in  Istanbul  described  Curitiba  as  "the  most 
innovative  city  in  the  world."  Often  compared  with  a  city  in 
Switzerland  or  Sweden,  Curitiba  is  a  city  that  functions,  even 
though  its  budget  of  US$1  billion  a  year  is  the  same  as  that  of 
Lausanne,  a  city  with  only  one-tenth  of  Curitiba's  population. 
Curitiba  has  taken  new  approaches  to  urban  ills  such  as  illiter- 
acy, homelessness,  transportation  and  government  service 
shortcomings,  unemployment,  pollution,  and  poverty.  It  has 
fifty-four  square  meters  of  green  area  per  inhabitant,  a  widely 
praised  trash-recycling  system,  and  a  world-class  transportation 
system  (used  by  85  percent  of  the  city's  commuters).  Curitiba's 
innovative  professionals  also  include  a  heart  surgeon,  Randas 
J.V.  Batista,  who  developed  a  revolutionary  and  potentially  very 
important  new  heart-operation  technique  that  surgeons 
around  the  world  began  learning  about  in  June  1996. 

Brazil  has  many  other  superlatives.  The  news  media  include 
highly  professional,  large-circulation  newspapers  and  maga- 
zines and  the  powerful  television  network  of  Rede  Globo  de 
Televisao  (World  Network),  owner  of  TV  Globo.  Brazil  has 
South  America's  most  aggressive  journalists.  In  the  1990s,  they 
have  investigated  banking  scandals,  environmental  abuses, 
massacres  of  Amazon  Indians,  murders  of  street  children,  and 
governmental  corruption.  Television  reaches  more  than  80 
percent  of  Brazilian  homes.  TV  Globo  is  Latin  America's  largest 
network  and  the  world's  fourth  largest  television  broadcasting 
system  (after  ABC,  NBC,  and  CBS).  Its  telenovelas  are  watched 
by  70  million  Brazilians  nightly  and  in  addition  are  sold  to  sixty- 
eight  nations,  earning  the  network  US$30  million  annually  in 
foreign  profits.  In  1996  Brazil  was  the  only  Latin  American 
country  with  a  communications  satellite  in  orbit.  In  the  print 
media,  Veja,  with  a  circulation  of  1.2  million,  is  Brazil's  most 
influential  magazine  and  the  world's  fifth  largest  weekly  news- 
magazine. All  of  these  media  have  enabled  Brazil  to  become 
the  world's  eighth  largest  advertising  market,  with  US$4.5  bil- 
lion spent  on  advertisements  in  1994  and  an  estimated  US$6 
billion  in  1995. 

Brazil  has  enormous  technological  know-how  and  industrial 
capabilities.  As  President  Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso 
explained  to  the  Wall  Street  Journal  in  May  1997,  "Our  people 
are  known  throughout  the  world  for  their  creativity,  their  abil- 


lv 


ity  to  learn,  to  adapt  to  new  circumstances,  and  to  incorporate 
technical  innovation  on  a  daily  basis." 

Brazil  is  the  most  highly  industrialized  country  in  Latin 
America.  Its  huge  industrial  base  includes  steel,  automobiles, 
military  aircraft  (including  the  AMX  jet  fighter),  tanks,  hydro- 
electric power,  and  a  nuclear  power  program.  Its  industrial 
base  is  so  developed  that  the  country  exports  high-technology 
aviation  components,  such  as  aircraft  engines  and  helicopter 
landing-gear  systems.  Brazil's  Alberto  Santos  Dumont  after  all 
was  the  "father  of  aviation."  Brazil  will  construct  a  small  part  of 
the  international  space  station.  Major  manufactured  products 
include  motor  vehicles,  aircraft  (including  the  internationally 
popular  EMB-120  Brasilia  commuter  turboprop  and  EMB-145 
regional  jetliner),  helicopters  (Brazil  has  the  world's  seventh 
largest  helicopter  fleet),  electrical  and  electronic  appliances, 
textiles,  garments,  and  footwear.  Since  lifting  its  ban  on  com- 
puter imports  in  October  1992,  Brazil  has  become  the  world's 
fastest-growing  computer  market  and  a  major  producer  of 
computer  software. 

Brazil's  major  trading  partners  are  the  United  States,  Ger- 
many, Switzerland,  Japan,  the  United  Kingdom,  France,  Argen- 
tina, Mexico,  and  Canada.  Exports  represent  7.3  percent  of 
Brazil's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary),  and 
industry  accounts  for  about  41  percent,  a  pattern  found  in 
some  developed  countries.  Once  an  industrial  powerhouse  of 
the  developing  world,  Brazil  now  counts  on  services  for  48  per- 
cent of  its  GDP. 

Brazil's  economy,  Latin  America's  biggest  and  the  world's 
eighth  largest,  is  greater  than  Russia's  and  twice  as  large  as 
Mexico's.  Its  economy  will  be  the  sixth  largest  in  the  world  by 
2015,  according  to  a  Ministry  of  Finance  prediction.  In  1997 
Brazil  had  an  estimated  GDP  of  US$775.5  billion,  according  to 
the  Economist  Intelligence  Unit  (EIU). 

Brazil  possesses  enormous  natural  resources,  including  the 
world's  largest  rain  forest.  The  country  contains  two-thirds  of 
the  endangered  Amazon  rain  forest,  a  region  representing  60 
percent  of  the  national  territory.  Sixty-six  percent  of  Brazil's 
territory  is  still  covered  by  forest.  The  Amazon  rain  forest  and 
Pantanal  (Great  Wetlands)  of  Mato  Grosso  are  two  of  the  larg- 
est wildlife  reserves  on  earth.  The  Amazon  region  is  home  to 
half  of  the  earth's  species  and  almost  one-third  of  the  world's 
250  primates.  Researchers  in  Brazil  have  identified  a  new  pri- 
mate species  in  Brazil  six  times  in  six  years,  including  1996.  The 


lvi 


Pantanal,  the  world's  largest  freshwater  wetland  (larger  than 
the  state  of  Florida),  contains  flora  and  fauna  that  cannot  be 
found  anywhere  else  in  the  world,  including  eighty  kinds  of 
mammals,  230  varieties  of  fish,  650  species  of  birds,  and  1,100 
types  of  butterflies. 

The  country's  vast  river  systems  serve  not  only  as  a  transpor- 
tation network  but  also  as  an  energy  source.  Brazil's  hydroelec- 
tric plants  provide  94  percent  of  the  country's  electricity.  Its 
huge  dams,  including  Itaipu,  easily  the  world's  largest  hydro- 
electric power  plant,  generate  vast  amounts  of  hydroelectric 
power  (a  potential  of  at  least  106,500  megawatts).  Brazil  is  also 
the  world's  largest  producer  of  bananas,  coffee,  and  orange 
juice.  It  has  the  world's  largest  iron  mine  and  vast  stores  of  pre- 
cious minerals.  It  is  the  world's  largest  exporter  of  iron  and  a 
major  exporter  of  steel. 

Sao  Paulo,  the  financial  center  of  Brazil,  is  an  economic 
power  in  itself;  the  state's  GDP  of  US$240  billion  is  larger  than 
Poland's  and  the  third  largest  economy  in  South  America,  after 
Brazil  itself  and  Argentina.  Its  GDP  per  capita  income  of 
US$7,000  is  nearly  twice  the  figure  for  all  of  Brazil.  Sao  Paulo 
has  half  of  the  country's  bank  accounts.  Its  largest  bank,  with 
US$33.3  billion  in  assets  and  1,900  branches,  is  the  Brazilian 
Discount  Bank  (Banco  Brasileiro  de  Descontos — Bradesco), 
Latin  America's  third  largest  and  possibly  most  powerful  bank 
holding  company;  Bradesco's  profits  in  1996  totaled  US$800 
million.  The  Sao  Paulo  Stock  Exchange  (Bolsa  de  Valores  do 
Sao  Paulo — Bovespa)  has  been  one  of  the  fastest  growing  in 
the  world,  at  least  until  May  1997.  Bovespa  had  a  market  capi- 
talization of  US$245  billion,  far  outranking  the  Mexican 
exchange's  US$118  billion  and  five  times  that  of  the  Buenos 
Aires  exchange.  In  early  1997,  the  Bovespa  index  gained  86 
percent,  but  by  early  November  it  had  fallen  37  percent,  a  casu- 
alty of  turmoil  in  world  financial  markets. 

As  a  result  of  having  to  adjust  to  three  decades  of  hyperinfla- 
tion, Brazil  has  one  of  the  world's  most  sophisticated  and  effi- 
cient banking  systems.  In  1993  the  top  forty  Brazilian  banks 
earned  US$9  billion  by  lending  inflation-eroded  deposits  to 
the  government  at  high  short-term  rates.  During  the  period  of 
hyperinflation,  the  number  of  banks  mushroomed  from  106 
institutions  in  1988  to  246  in  1994.  In  1996  Brazil  had  six  of 
Latin  America's  ten  largest  banks,  including  the  number-one 
ranked  Federal  Savings  Bank  (Caixa  Economica  Federal — 
CEF),  with  US$90.8  billion  in  assets.

In  1995  Brazil  was  ranked  third,  after  China  and  Mexico,  for 
planned  investments  by  American  multinational  companies. 
The  second  largest  United  States  trading  partner  in  the  hemi- 
sphere in  1995-97,  it  is  first  in  foreign  direct  investment  from 
the  United  States,  with  US$41  billion.  According  to  President 
Cardoso,  foreign  direct  investment  in  Brazil  in  1996  totaled 
US$9.4  billion,  as  compared  with  US$3.9  billion  in  1995  and 
was  expected  to  exceed  US$14  billion  in  1997.  Multinationals 
based  in  Brazil  remitted  US$4  billion  in  dividends  to  their  par- 
ent corporations  during  1995.  The  energy,  mining,  petroleum, 
and  telecommunications  sectors  expect  investments  of  US$24 
billion  by  the  end  of  the  1990s. 

Amid  the  chaos  of  inflation,  Brazil's  private  sector  had 
become  the  most  dynamic  in  Latin  America  by  1994,  with  the 
automobile  industry  leading  the  country's  economic  upturn. 
Once  the  symbol  of  the  "economic  miracle"  period  of  1968-74 
but  declared  all  but  defunct  in  the  1980s,  the  automobile  sec- 
tor— aided  by  tax  breaks,  an  end  to  the  list  of  banned  imports, 
and  the  relaunching  of  the  Volkswagen  Beetle — was  revived  in 
1990.  Brazil's  automobile  industry,  Latin  America's  biggest 
industrial  complex,  overtook  Italy  and  Mexico  in  1993  to 
become  the  tenth  largest  producer  of  cars  in  the  world.  Brazil 
produced  1.58  million  cars  in  1994  and  1.65  million  in  1995, 
making  it  the  world's  ninth  largest  automotive  manufacturer. 
Helped  by  a  70  percent  tariff  on  imports  by  foreign  automobile 
manufacturers,  sales  totaled  about  1.7  million  vehicles  in  1996 
and  were  expected  to  reach  2.5  to  3  million  cars  and  trucks  by 
2000.  However,  the  influx  of  new  cars  has  made  congestion  and 
pollution  in  already  clogged  cities  even  worse.  Furthermore, 
carmakers  with  manufacturing  facilities  in  Brazil  have  been 
uncompetitive  because  of  a  tariff  reduction  on  automobile 
imports  mandated  by  the  Common  Market  of  the  South  (Mer- 
cado  Comum  do  Sul — Mercosul;  also  known  as  Mercosur — see 
Glossary).  General  Motors  was  planning  in  1997  to  compete 
with  a  new  US$9,000  automobile  that  would  be  the  most 
affordable  one  in  Brazil. 

In  the  governmental  realm,  Brazil  is  the  third  largest  democ- 
racy (after  India  and  the  United  States).  It  has  had  civilian 
democratic  rule  since  the  end  of  the  military  dictatorship 
(1964-85).  The  period  of  military  rule  was  relatively  benign 
when  compared  with  military  dictatorships  in  the  Southern 
Cone  countries  of  Argentina,  Chile,  and  Uruguay.  In  recent 
decades,  Brazil  has  been  relatively  free  from  revolutionary  vio- 


lviii 


lence  and  terrorism,  with  the  exception  of  a  left-wing  terrorist 
campaign  in  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s.  Indeed,  the  foreign 
image  of  Brazilians  as  a  joyful,  fun-loving,  and  nonviolent  peo- 
ple began  to  fade  as  a  result  of  the  regime's  repression,  prima- 
rily from  1968  to  1972. 

The  constitution  of  October  5,  1988,  Brazil's  eighth,  pro- 
vides for  a  presidential  system  with  several  vestiges  of  a  mixed 
parliamentary  system.  Although  the  1988  constitution  reestab- 
lishes many  of  the  prerogatives  of  the  Congress,  the  president 
retains  considerable  "imperial"  powers.  According  to  political 
scientist  David  V.  Fleischer,  Brazilian  presidents  may  still  have 
more  "imperial"  powers  than  their  United  States  counterparts 
by  being  less  accountable  to  Congress  and  being  able  to  make 
innumerable  political  appointments. 

Under  a  system  of  checks  and  balances  similar  to  the  United 
States  system,  the  three  branches  of  government  operate  with 
substantial  harmony  and  mutual  respect,  but  on  rare  occasions 
one  of  the  branches  may  challenge  or  reject  the  interference  of 
the  others.  However,  as  Professor  Fleischer  points  out,  execu- 
tive-legislative conflict  is  inherent  in  the  system  because  the 
president  is  elected  directly  by  a  national  constituency,  whereas 
Congress  is  elected  by  very  parochial  regional  interests.  Rural 
states  of  the  North  (Norte)  and  Northeast  (Nordeste)  elect 
proportionately  more  members  of  Congress  than  the  industrial 
and  more  populous  states  of  the  South  and  Southeast,  accord- 
ing to  political  scientist  Ricardo  Tavares. 

The  constitution  continues  the  holding  of  municipal  elec- 
tions two  years  after  presidential  elections.  Thus,  municipal 
elections  were  held  in  1988,  1992,  and  1996  and  are  scheduled 
for  2000  and  2004,  while  both  state  and  national  elections  are 
scheduled  for  1998  and  2002.  The  number  of  political  parties 
increased  from  eleven  in  1987  to  eighteen  in  1996,  of  which 
eight  are  significant.  Unlike  in  the  United  States,  where  two 
main  parties  are  national  organizations,  Brazilian  parties  are 
regionally  based. 

A  national  plebiscite  was  held  on  April  21,  1993,  to  decide 
the  form  of  government  (a  republic  or,  oddly  enough,  a  consti- 
tutional monarchy)  and  the  system  of  government  (presiden- 
tial or  parliamentary),  and  it  overwhelmingly  reaffirmed  Brazil 
as  a  presidential  republic.  However,  a  constitutional  revision 
enacted  in  1994  constrained  the  chief  executive  by  shortening 
the  presidential  term  from  five  to  four  years,  as  of  January 
1995,  in  exchange  for  allowing  immediate  reelection 


lix 


(approved  by  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  (Camara  dos  Deputa- 
dos)  in  January  1997  and  the  Federal  Senate  (Senado  Federal; 
hereafter,  Senate)  in  June  1997).  In  mid-1997  there  were  seri- 
ous plans  to  set  up  a  parliamentary  government  in  Brazil  by 
2002. 

With  its  modernistic  capital  of  Brasilia  and  its  booming 
economy,  Brazil  was  poised  in  the  early  1970s  during  the  "eco- 
nomic miracle"  period  (1967-74)  to  become  "the  country  of 
the  future."  On  being  inaugurated  on  April  21,  1960,  Brasilia 
was  referred  to  as  "the  city  of  the  twenty-first  century"  and  a 
"monument  to  the  future."  However,  the  US$10  billion  needed 
to  build  and  support  the  Federal  District  (Distrito  Federal) 
started  an  inflationary  spiral  that  was  not  tamed  until  late  1994. 
Far  removed  from  the  nation's  realities,  the  sterile  capital  suc- 
ceeded only  in  corrupting  the  political  process  by  creating  an 
enclave  of  privilege  and  self-interest.  The  1990  census  indi- 
cated that  the  wealthiest  10  percent  of  Brasilia's  population  of 
about  500,000  residents  earned  75  percent  more  than  the  top 
10  percent  in  the  rest  of  the  country. 

Although  Lucio  Costa's  jetliner-design  for  the  futuristic  capi- 
tal was  supposed  to  reflect  Brazil's  aspirations  of  grandeza 
(greatness),  Brasilia's  once-dramatic  architecture,  designed  in 
large  part  by  Oscar  Niemeyer,  now  inspires  feelings  of  eerie 
alienation.  Niemeyer,  who  is  building  a  museum  of  modern  art 
in  the  city,  now  refers  to  Brasilia  as  "the  city  of  lost  hopes." 
More  than  half  of  the  1.2  million  residents  in  the  city's  metro- 
politan area,  including  most  of  the  capital's  poor,  live  in  more 
than  a  dozen  satellite  cities  (cidades  satelites),  in  favelas  as  far 
away  as  150  kilometers  from  the  city's  center.  Brasilia  is  reputed 
to  have  the  highest  rates  of  divorce  and  suicide  of  any  Brazilian 
city.  In  its  favor,  however,  Brasilia  has  little  air  pollution,  its  traf- 
fic congestion  is  tolerable,  and  its  crime  rate  is  relatively  low. 

Despite  its  many  superlatives,  the  image  of  Brazil  as  a  land  of 
immense  rain  forest,  cordiality,  samba,  political  conciliation, 
and  racial  harmony  has  masked  the  reality  of  urban  violence, 
chronic  political  instability  and  corruption,  environmental 
depredation,  highly  unequal  income  distribution  (the  worst  in 
the  world,  according  to  the  World  Bank — see  Glossary), 
extraordinarily  high  levels  of  abandonment  and  abuse  of  chil- 
dren, and  severe  economic  and  social  disequilibrium. 

Beginning  in  the  early  1970s,  crime  soared  as  the  consumer 
expectations  of  poor  Brazilians,  raised  by  television  advertising, 
were  crushed.  Violence  has  become  an  increasingly  visible 


lx 


aspect  of  Brazilian  society,  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas,  and 
includes  rising  vigilantism  by  citizens.  There  has  also  been  an 
epidemic  of  husbands  killing  their  wives  with  impunity  by 
invoking  the  "defense  of  honor"  code.  By  the  early  1990s, 
homem  cordial  no  longer  seemed  to  fit  the  Brazilian  archetype, 
as  news  of  massacres  of  Indians  by  miners,  landless  activists  by 
landowners  and  police,  and  street  children  and  prisoners  by 
police  became  more  frequent. 

Death  squads  {esquadroes  de  morte)  of  off-duty  or  retired 
policemen  target  criminals  in  the  favelas  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  and 
Sao  Paulo  and  street  children,  but  to  little  effect.  Their  actions 
only  seem  to  generate  more  crime.  Civilian  deaths  at  the  hands 
of  the  Sao  Paulo  Police  increased  from  an  average  of  34.1  per 
month  in  1993  to  56  per  month  in  the  first  half  of  1996,  accord- 
ing to  the  Sao  Paulo  Police  ombudsman  office.  Between  1992 
and  1996,  Sao  Paulo  Police  killed  2,203  persons.  Military  Police 
(Policia  Militar — PM)  members  were  suspected  in  at  least  sev- 
enteen of  forty-nine  massacres  in  Sao  Paulo  in  the  first  eleven 
months  of  1995.  Efforts  to  control  the  Military  Police  in  metro- 
politan Sao  Paulo  supposedly  improved  their  record  of  killings 
from  1,190  in  1992  to  106  in  1996. 

Nevertheless,  TV  Globo's  showing  of  videotapes  of  innocent 
civilians  being  shot,  beaten  savagely,  or  robbed  by  uniformed 
Military  Police  members  in  working-class  suburbs  of  Sao  Paulo 
in  early  March  1997  and  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  early  April  shocked 
the  country  and  caused  profound  soul-searching  in  Brazil.  A 
poll  taken  in  early  April  1997  by  Folha  de  Sao  Paulo  found  that 
fewer  than  half  of  the  people  surveyed  feared  criminals  more 
than  they  feared  the  police,  and  that  42  percent  of  all  residents 
in  the  city  of  Sao  Paulo  had  either  experienced  police  violence 
first-hand,  or  knew  someone  who  had.  According  to  Jornal  do 
Brasil,  in  the  first  half  of  1996  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  police  killed 
20.5  civilians  per  month,  as  compared  with  an  average  of  3.2 
persons  per  month  prior  to  June  1995. 

The  world's  ninth  most  violent  city  by  1979,  Greater  Rio  de 
Janeiro  reportedly  has  recorded  more  than  70,000  homicides 
since  1985.  In  the  first  nine  months  of  1995,  there  were  6,012 
homicides  in  the  city,  a  10  percent  increase  over  1994.  About 
90  percent  of  Rio  de  Janeiro's  violent  crime  is  drug  related  and 
involves  minors,  whether  as  victims  or  perpetrators.  In  1994-95 
the  military  was  deployed  in  Rio  de  Janeiro's  favelas  to  carry 
out  anti-drug-trafficking  functions,  normally  a  police  responsi- 


lxi 


bility.  However,  the  temporary  military  presence  in  the  favelas 
had  no  real  impact  on  controlling  the  city's  crime  problem. 

By  1996  kidnappings  for  ransom  of  leading  businessmen  and 
socialites  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Sao  Paulo  had  increased  to  an 
estimated  fifty  per  month  since  1994,  in  comparison  with  a 
reported  seven  in  1988.  Kidnappings  increased  by  22.8  percent 
and  bank  robberies  by  89.3  percent  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  State  in 
1995,  in  relation  to  1994,  according  to  the  Secretariat  for  Pub- 
lic Security  (Secretaria  de  Seguranca  Publica — SSP).  A  poll 
conducted  by  the  DataBrasil  Research  Institute  (Instituto  de 
Pesquisas  DataBrasil)  in  late  1995  found  that  76.5  percent  of 
600  cariocas  (Rio  de  Janeiro  residents)  felt  that  the  city  had 
become  more  violent  during  1995  than  in  1994.  On  November 
28,  1995,  at  least  70,000  cariocas,  rallying  under  the  slogan 
Reage,  Rio!  (React,  Rio!),  marched  to  protest  the  violence.  By 
September  1996,  Rio  de  Janeiro's  crime  rate  was  declining  for 
the  first  time  in  years,  with  significant  reductions  in  kidnap- 
pings and  bank  robberies,  thanks  to  an  energetic  new  com- 
mand of  the  police  force. 

At  the  national  level,  homicide  has  had  a  major  impact  on 
Brazilian  youths.  A  survey  of  59.4  million  Brazilian  children, 
published  on  November  17,  1997,  found  that  homicide  had 
become  the  leading  cause  of  death  among  fifteen-  to  seven- 
teen-year-olds in  Brazil,  with  its  rate  more  than  tripling  since 
1980.  The  survey,  conducted  by  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geog- 
raphy and  Statistics  (Fundacao  Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Geogra- 
fia  e  Estatistica — IBGE)  and  the  United  Nations  Children's 
Fund  (UNICEF),  found  that  25.3  percent  of  deaths  in  that  age- 
group  were  homicides,  as  compared  with  7.8  percent  in  1980. 

Police  corruption  has  also  been  a  growing  problem.  In  late 
1995,  the  New  York  Times  reported  that,  according  to  an  inter- 
nal report  on  the  notoriously  corrupt  Rio  de  Janeiro  Police 
Department,  an  estimated  80  percent,  or  9,600  members,  of 
the  12,000-member  force  were  dishonest  and  collected  more 
than  US$1  million  a  month  in  bribes  or  extortion  from  drug 
dealers  and  kidnappers.  Brazilians  have  cited  the  need  for  a 
reformed  and  unified  police  force  under  federal  control.  On 
April  7,  1997,  in  an  attempt  to  change  the  profile  of  Brazil's 
police  forces,  President  Cardoso  created  a  National  Secretariat 
of  Human  Rights  (Secretaria  Nacional  dos  Direitos 
Humanos — SNDH),  which  is  under  the  authority  of  the  Minis- 
try of  Justice.  The  federal  crackdown  on  human  rights  abuses 
and  diminished  earning  power  under  the  three-year-old 


lxii 


national  economic  stabilization  policy  led  to  a  wave  of  nation- 
wide police  strikes  in  July  1997.  As  a  result,  Brazilian  cities  were 
hit  by  crime  waves. 

No  issue  has  focused  more  world  attention  on  Brazil  since 
the  1970s  than  the  destruction  of  the  Amazonian  jungle.  Both 
Amazonia  (the  Amazon  region)  and  the  Pantanal  are  suffering 
the  effects  of  human  intervention  from  deforestation,  slash- 
and-burn  agriculture  (see  Glossary),  highway  construction,  ille- 
gal mining,  drug  trafficking,  and  pollution.  Tropical  wood  cut- 
ters have  already  bought  up  more  than  4.5  million  hectares  of 
virgin  forest  in  the  Amazon  Region,  which  holds  about  one- 
third  of  the  world's  remaining  tropical  woods.  Dam  building 
has  also  destroyed  large  swaths  of  rain  forest.  For  example,  the 
Tucuruf  Reservoir  inundated  2,000  square  kilometers  of  tropi- 
cal forest. 

The  topics  of  rapid  deforestation  and  extensive  burning  of 
the  Amazon  rain  forest  and  environmental  pollution  received 
unprecedented  international  attention  in  the  late  1980s  and 
early  1990s.  Water  and  air  pollution  had  also  become  a  serious 
problem  for  Brazil.  Sao  Paulo  State's  Tiete  is  so  polluted  that  in 
1992  the  state  was  forced  to  launch  a  US$2.6  billion  program  to 
revive  it.  In  June  1992,  Rio  de  Janeiro  hosted  the  United 
Nations  (UN)  Conference  on  the  Environment  and  Develop- 
ment (Eco-92).  However,  the  Brazilian  government's  attention 
to  the  problems  of  deforestation  and  pollution  waned  follow- 
ing Eco-92,  despite  the  creation  in  late  1993  of  the  Ministry  of 
Environment  and  the  Amazon  Region. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  discussion  of  public  policies  intended  to 
promote  sustainable  development  (see  Glossary)  remained 
intense.  One  issue  concerns  the  Pantanal,  which  is  threatened 
by  South  America's  massive  waterway  project,  Hidrovia,  a  pro- 
posed 3,460-kilometer  waterway  along  the  world's  fourth-larg- 
est river  system,  the  Tiete-Parana,  intended  to  open  the 
continent  for  the  region's  new  free-trade  bloc.  According  to  a 
study  by  the  Environmental  Defense  Fund,  "channelization, 
dredging,  channel  simplification,  and  water  control  structures 
will  drastically  change  the  hydrology  in  the  Pantanal  region," 
causing  the  eventual  "loss  of  biodiversity  as  habitats  decline  and 
exotic  species  are  introduced  via  barge  traffic  and  human 
migrations."  However,  Brazil  shelved  the  project  in  early  1998. 

As  a  result  of  deforestation  and  highway  construction, 
Amazonia  now  consists  of  thirteen  different  regions  that  are  in 
a  critical  political,  social,  economic,  and  environmental  situa- 


lxiii 


tion,  according  to  a  study  begun  in  1991  by  the  IBGE  and  the 
Strategic  Affairs  Secretariat  (Secretaria  de  Assuntos  Estrategi- 
cos — SAE)  of  the  presidency  of  the  republic.  Since  1970  an 
area  larger  than  86  million  hectares  has  been  deforested.  Mar- 
cio  Nogueira  Barbosa,  director  general  of  the  government's 
National  Institute  of  Space  Research  (Instituto  Nacional  de 
Pesquisas  Espaciais — INPE),  citing  INPE  statistics  for  1995,  told 
the  New  York  Times  on  October  12,  1995,  that  "burnings  in  the 
Amazon  Region  appear  to  be  approaching  the  worst  levels 
ever." 

During  1992-97  the  Brazilian  government  claimed  that 
destruction  of  the  Amazon  rain  forest  had  slowed.  However, 
Brazilian  government  information  on  the  extent  of  forest  clear- 
ing in  the  Amazon  had  dried  up,  and,  five  years  after  Eco-92, 
the  government  appeared  unaware  of  what  was  happening  in 
the  Amazon  rain  forest.  The  New  York  Times  reported  that  new 
data  released  in  September  1996  showed  that  deforestation  of 
the  Amazon  rose  by  34  percent  during  1991-94,  from  6,913 
square  kilometers  in  the  1990-91  burning  season  to  9,253 
square  kilometers  a  year  by  1994,  consuming  rain  forest  the 
size  of  Denmark.  A  study  by  the  World  Wildlife  Fund  (WWF) 
released  in  mid-1997  singled  out  Brazil  as  the  nation  with  the 
highest  annual  rate  of  forest  loss  in  the  world.  The  New  York 
Times  reported  on  November  3,  1997,  that  burnings  in  the 
Amazon  region  were  up  28  percent  over  1996,  according  to  sat- 
ellite data. 

Environmentalists  have  charged  that  tobacco  and  soybean 
cultivation,  in  addition  to  trans-Amazonian  highway  construc- 
tion, has  played  a  major  role  in  Brazil's  deforestation.  Tobacco 
plantations  occupied  271  million  hectares  of  the  nation's  ara- 
ble land  in  1990.  Brazil,  which  produced  450,000  tons  of 
tobacco  in  1994,  is  the  world's  fourth  leading  tobacco  pro- 
ducer, after  China,  the  United  States,  and  India.  Soybean  culti- 
vation has  had  a  similarly  devastating  effect  on  the  rain  forest. 
The  largest  areas  deforested  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s  from 
expanding  soybean  cultivation  were  in  Mato  Grosso  State  and 
the  southern  part  of  Maranhao  State. 

Ninety  percent  of  Brazilians  live  on  10  percent  of  the  land, 
mostly  along  the  322-kilometer-wide  east  coast  region.  The 
Atlantic  Forest  (Mata  Atlantica)  once  stretched  continuously 
along  the  entire  coast  of  Brazil,  extending  far  inland,  and  cov- 
ering an  area  equivalent  to  France  and  Spain  combined.  Today, 
less  than  7  percent  of  it  remains,  all  in  scattered  fragments,  and 


lxiv 


it  is  one  of  the  world's  two  most  threatened  tropical  forests. 
Many  of  Brazil's  303  species  of  fauna  threatened  with  extinc- 
tion are  in  the  Atlantic  Forest  region,  which  contains  25  per- 
cent of  all  forms  of  animal  and  plant  life  existing  on  the  planet. 
The  region's  biodiversity  is  forty  times  greater  than  the  Ama- 
zon's. 

Brazil's  National  Indian  Foundation  (Fundacao  Nacional  do 
Indio — Funai)  estimates  that  the  indigenous  Indian  popula- 
tion, with  about  230  tribes  located  in  about  530  known  Indian 
reservations  in  Brazil,  totals  330,000  members.  An  estimated 
10,000  to  15,000  Indians  have  never  had  contact  with  Brazilian 
government  officials.  About  62  percent,  or  137,000,  live  in  the 
Amazon  region.  They  are  the  descendants  of  what  could  be  the 
oldest  Americans.  According  to  a  team  of  archaeologists  led  by 
Anna  C.  Roosevelt,  radiocarbon  dating  of  material  in  a  cave 
located  near  Monte  Alegre,  between  Manaus  and  Belem,  shows 
that  early  Paleo-Indians  were  contemporaries  of  the  Clovis  peo- 
ple in  the  southwestern  United  States  and  had  a  distinctive  for- 
aging economy,  stone  technology,  and  cave  art,  dating  back 
between  10,000  and  11,200  years  ago. 

One-tenth  of  Brazil's  national  territory  is  to  be  set  aside  for 
its  Indian  population,  according  to  the  constitution.  However, 
fewer  than  half  of  the  reservations  have  been  demarcated,  and 
the  issue  has  continued  to  be  controversial.  Settlers  and  gold 
miners  have  massacred  Indians.  In  May  1996,  the  Ministry  of 
Justice  published  decrees  recognizing  the  existence  of  seven- 
teen indigenous  areas  in  Brazil,  totaling  8.6  million  hectares. 
Each  Brazilian  Indian  (including  children)  has  on  average  an 
area  of  400  hectares  on  which  to  live.  By  comparison,  Native 
Americans  in  the  United  States  live  on  only  eighteen  hectares 
per  person.  Some  members  of  Brazil's  Congress  believe  that 
the  policy  gives  too  much  land  to  only  two-tenths  of  the  popula- 
tion. 

A  decree  signed  by  President  Cardoso  in  January  1996  did 
not  include  the  Indians  as  one  of  his  priorities.  By  permitting 
states,  municipalities,  and  non-Indian  individuals  to  contest 
demarcation  of  Indian  land,  the  decree  alarmed  indigenous 
support  groups.  The  executive  order  could  end  much  of  the 
violence  against  the  Indians,  by  giving  non-Indians  a  legal 
forum.  However,  official  figures  indicate  that  153  of  the  554 
areas  recognized  by  the  government  as  Indian  territories  are 
liable  to  be  revised  under  the  decree.  For  example,  in  October 
1996  a  government  decision  on  whether  to  uphold  claims  by 


lxv 


12,000  Indians,  most  of  them  from  the  30,000-member  Macuxi 
tribe,  to  more  than  40  percent  of  225,116-square-kilometer 
Roraima,  Brazil's  northernmost  state,  was  put  on  hold  indefi- 
nitely as  a  result  of  legal  challenges  by  non-Indians. 

Despite  its  vast  natural  resources  and  economic  wealth,  Bra- 
zil has  an  overwhelmingly  poor  population.  Relatively  few  Bra- 
zilians have  benefited  from  the  economy.  In  a  country  with 
some  of  the  world's  widest  social  differences,  grinding  poverty 
and  misery  coexist  with  great  industrial  wealth;  20  percent  of 
the  population  is  extremely  poor  and  1  percent  extremely 
wealthy.  Brazil's  Gini  index  (see  Glossary)  in  1991  was  0.6366. 
According  to  the  UN,  Brazil  had  the  most  uneven  distribution 
of  wealth  in  the  world  in  1995.  The  richest  10  percent  of  Brazil- 
ians hold  65  percent  of  Brazil's  wealth  (GDP),  while  the  poor- 
est 40  percent  share  only  7  percent.  Brazil  placed  sixty-eighth 
out  of  174  countries  in  the  UN's  1997  human  development 
index  (see  Glossary). 

In  the  mid-1990s,  at  least  one-fifth  of  the  population,  or 
about  32  million  people,  lived  in  extreme  poverty  (see  Glos- 
sary), making  less  than  US$100  a  month.  However,  the  anti- 
inflation  policies  of  the  Cardoso  government  helped  pull  13 
million  Brazilians  out  of  poverty,  according  to  the  Applied  Eco- 
nomic Research  Institute  (Instituto  de  Pesquisa  Economica 
Aplicada — IPEA).  During  Cardoso's  first  three  years  in  office, 
the  number  of  people  living  below  the  poverty  level  dropped  9 
percentage  points  to  21  percent.  Thus,  poverty  in  Brazil  today 
is  proportionately  less,  even  though  it  is  more  visible  and 
shocking,  especially  in  the  cities. 

An  estimated  45  million  children  and  young  people  live  in 
inhuman  conditions,  and  the  number  of  child  workers  has 
been  as  high  as  10  million.  Children  from  large  poor  families 
start  working  from  the  age  of  ten  in  order  to  help  their  parents. 
According  to  the  IBGE,  in  1995  there  were  7.5  million  Brazil- 
ian workers  younger  than  eighteen,  a  group  that  represents 
11.6  percent  of  the  work  force.  However,  the  IBGE  reported 
that  the  number  of  children  between  the  ages  of  ten  and  four- 
teen who  were  employed  decreased  by  163,000  from  1993  to 
1995.  Some  3  million  workers  are  between  ten  and  fourteen 
years  of  age.  Nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs)  estimate 
that  anywhere  from  500,000  to  two  million  Brazilian  children 
are  forced  into  prostitution  every  year. 

The  vast  substratum  of  the  population  lacks  adequate  hous- 
ing, employment,  education,  health  care,  or  any  social  security.

An  estimated  10  million  Brazilian  families  are  homeless.  The 
government  spends  only  US$80  per  person  annually  on  public 
health,  less  than  a  third  of  what  Argentina  spends.  Conse- 
quently, the  health  system  is  struggling  to  survive;  its  employees 
are  often  overworked  and  underpaid,  and  corruption  is 
endemic.  In  this  context,  the  new  law  that  took  effect  January 

I,  1998,  mandating  organ  donations  for  transplants  unless  the 
person  applies  for  an  exemption,  sparked  fear  and  outrage. 

Brazil  stands  out  for  its  sharp  regional  and  social  disparities. 
Of  Brazil's  39.1  million  poor  in  1990,  53.1  percent  were  in  the 
poverty-stricken  Northeast  and  25.4  percent  were  in  the  pros- 
perous Southeast.  According  to  the  IBGE,  in  1996  the  more 
developed  Southeast  and  South  regions  had  63  million  and 
23.1  million  people,  respectively,  who  generated  about  75  per- 
cent of  the  country's  GDP.  By  contrast,  the  Northeast  had  45 
million  residents  and  generated  only  about  13  percent  of  Bra- 
zil's GDP.  The  huge  North  and  Center-West  (Centro-Oeste) 
regions,  which  occupy  64.1  percent  of  Brazil's  total  area,  had 

II.  1  million  and  10.2  million  residents,  respectively,  and  also 
generated  only  about  13  percent  of  Brazil's  GDP. 

In  1988  the  GDP  per  capita  income  of  the  Southeast  was  43.6 
percent  higher  than  the  national  average,  and  that  of  the 
Northeast  was  37.5  percent  lower.  Brazil's  GDP  per  capita 
income  was  US$5,128  in  1997,  as  compared  with  US$3,008  in 
1994,  according  to  the  IBGE.  However,  the  1997  GDP  per  cap- 
ita was  practically  meaningless  because  of  the  vast  disparity 
between  north  and  south  or,  more  specifically,  the  Southeast 
and  Northeast.  Whereas  Sao  Paulo  State  had  a  US$7,000  GDP 
per  capita  in  1994,  Pernambuco,  a  relatively  prosperous  North- 
east state,  had  only  US$1,500. 

Brazil's  regional  and  social  disparities  are  also  reflected  in 
the  great  inequalities  of  its  education  system.  Illiteracy  is  wide- 
spread, particularly  in  the  poor  states  of  the  Northeast  and 
North.  In  1995,  according  to  Ministry  of  Education  statistics,  18 
percent  of  Brazilians  over  fifteen  years  of  age  could  not  read  or 
write.  Brazil  will  enter  the  twenty-first  century  with  an  esti- 
mated illiteracy  rate  of  16  percent.  (Functional  illiteracy  in  Bra- 
zil is  as  high  as  60  percent.)  Half  of  students  nationwide  repeat 
the  first  grade  through  a  system  of  routine  flunking.  It  takes  an 
average  of  11.4  years  for  students  to  complete  the  first  eight 
years  of  education,  and  only  4.5  percent  of  all  students  who 
start  school  end  up  enrolling  in  a  university.  In  1994  UNICEF 
rated  Brazil's  basic  education  system  as  being  in  last  place  in 


lxvii 


world  ranking,  with  large  rates  of  nonattendance  in  poor  states. 
As  much  as  68  percent  of  the  electorate,  or  65  million  people, 
never  finish  primary  school.  In  a  hopeful  development,  how- 
ever, primary  education  in  Brazil  is  being  radically  reformed. 

In  1995  the  countrywide  average  salary  was  US$650  per 
month,  and  the  minimum  wage  amounted  to  US$780  per  year. 
In  April  1995,  the  Cardoso  government  reluctantly  raised  the 
minimum  monthly  salary  to  100  reals  (R$100;  Portuguese  sin- 
gu\ar=real,  pronounced  hay-OW;  for  value — see  Glossary).  In 
1994,  when  the  minimum  monthly  salary  was  R$70  a  month 
(about  US$58),  half  the  population  earned  less  than  US$240  a 
month,  and  about  15  million  people,  including  11.5  million 
pensioners,  were  on  the  minimum  wage.  The  income  of  about 
12  million  Brazilians  is  less  than  US$65  per  month. 

Brazil's  official  statistics  on  employment,  incomes,  consump- 
tion, and  living  standards  do  not  provide  an  accurate  portrayal 
of  the  real  Brazil.  The  black  market  enables  millions  of  Brazil- 
ians to  get  by  in  a  country  where  household  appliances,  auto- 
mobiles, compact  disks  (CDs),  restaurant  food,  and  other 
consumer  items  cost  more  than  in  France,  Germany,  or  the 
United  States.  The  country's  vast  informal  economy  (see  Glos- 
sary) produces  from  US$200  billion  to  US$300  billion  per  year, 
according  to  figures  from  the  IBGE.  Brazil's  informal  market, 
consisting  of  thousands  of  small  to  medium-size  businesses  that 
neither  abide  by  government  regulations  nor  pay  taxes,  is  three 
times  larger  than  the  Portuguese  economy  and  equal  to  that  of 
Sweden.  The  illegal  market  provides  an  income  for  an  esti- 
mated 30  million  Brazilians.  According  to  an  early  1997  esti- 
mate by  the  weekly  Sao  Paulo  newsmagazine  IstoE,  about  half  of 
the  country's  workforce  is  employed  in  the  black  market.  In 
Sao  Paulo  only  52  percent  of  the  workforce  is  employed  in  the 
formal  economy,  according  to  the  Interunion  Department  for 
Statistics  and  Socioeconomic  Studies  (Departamento  Inter- 
sindical  de  Estatistica  e  Estudos  Socio-Economicos — DIEESE). 
In  Rio  de  Janeiro,  one  in  every  four  persons  works  in  informal 
jobs. 

Brazil's  regional  income  disparities  have  produced  massive 
migration  to  favelas,  particularly  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Sao 
Paulo.  By  1996  the  country's  poverty  had  become  predomi- 
nantly urban.  The  IPEA  estimated  that  23  million  of  the  30  mil- 
lion poor  live  in  cities,  with  9  million  of  them  in  big  cities — half 
of  them  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Sao  Paulo.  In  Rio  de  Janeiro, 
which  has  the  largest  concentration  of  poor  migrants,  17  per- 


lxviii 


cent  of  the  city's  metropolitan  population,  or  1  million  people, 
live  in  hillside  favelas.  Although  rampant  crime  and  disease 
remain  entrenched  in  the  favelas,  steps  have  been  taken  to 
improve  the  living  conditions.  For  example,  Rio  de  Janeiro  has 
slowed  the  growth  of  its  favelas  by  prohibiting  new  settlements, 
and  more  than  300,000  residents  have  been  moved  to  new 
homes.  Sao  Paulo's  huge  Cingapura  project  has  been  replacing 
243  favelas,  containing  500,000  people,  with  low-rise  blocks  of 
apartment  buildings  offering  low-interest  mortgages. 

Brazil  is  steeped  in  five  centuries  of  Roman  Catholicism,  but 
the  religious  affiliation  of  the  Brazilian  population  has  not 
remained  unaffected  by  a  decade  of  corruption,  inflation,  and 
economic  hard  times  under  civilian  rule.  About  93  percent  of 
Brazilians  identified  themselves  as  Catholic  in  1960;  by  1993, 
however,  the  figure  had  dropped  to  72.5  percent.  Only  an  esti- 
mated 10  million  of  Brazil's  Roman  Catholics  attend  Mass  regu- 
larly, and  most  Brazilian  Catholics  ignore  the  conservative 
Roman  Catholic  Church's  teachings  on  family  planning  meth- 
ods. The  rapid  growth  and  spreading  influence  of  evangelical 
churches,  such  as  the  3.5  million-member  Universal  Church  of 
the  Kingdom  of  God  (Igreja  Universal  do  Reino  de  Deus),  have 
put  into  question  the  Vatican's  characterization  of  Brazil  as  the 
world's  largest  Catholic  country.  Millions  of  Brazil's  poor  have 
turned  away  from  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  and  the  libera- 
tion theology  (see  Glossary)  that  it  began  to  espouse  in  the 
1970s. 

Instead,  poorer  Brazilians — more  interested  in  spiritualism, 
hard  work,  sober  living  habits,  and  individual  advancement 
than  the  political  causes  promoted  by  liberation  theologists — 
have  embraced  Protestantism  by  the  millions.  By  1994  about  22 
percent  of  the  population  (an  estimated  35  million  Brazilians) 
was  Protestant,  as  compared  with  only  3.7  percent  in  1960. 
Protestantism  has  swept  the  country  because  Brazilian  culture, 
which  is  both  spiritual  and  pragmatic,  interacts  readily  with  the 
Pentecostal  message  delivered  by  plain-speaking,  blue-collar 
evangelical  pastors,  many  of  whom  are  blacks,  in  contrast  to  the 
Latin  language  of  a  Catholic  Mass.  The  Pentecostal  churches 
offer  more  social  support  in  prayer  groups  and  give  rural 
migrants  a  feeling  of  security  in  large  cities. 

Competing  with  the  evangelizing  Protestants  is  the  Catholic 
Charismatic  Renewal,  whose  members  practice  an  estatic 
prayer  style,  emphasizing  lively  music,  "healings,"  and  speaking 
in  tongues.  With  a  claimed  8  million  active  Charismatic  Catho- 


lxix 


lies,  Brazil  is  considered  to  be  the  world's  leading  center  of  the 
movement 

Other  former  Roman  Catholics  have  been  lost  to  espiritas,  a 
cult  founded  by  a  French  mystic,  and  Afro-Brazilian  religions, 
such  as  the  Afro-centric  candomble  and  the  twentieth-century 
cult  more  reflective  of  Brazilian  urban  life  called  umbanda. 
Owing  to  a  Brazilian  proclivity  toward  magic  and  mysticism, 
Afro-Brazilian  cults  have  attracted  members  from  all  social 
classes,  professions,  and  ethnic  groups,  including  Brazilians  of 
German,  Italian,  or  Japanese  ancestry.  However,  Christian 
evangelical  churches  have  been  drawing  increasing  numbers  of 
former  candomble  and  umbanda  worshipers. 

At  least  44  percent  of  Brazil's  much-touted  "racial  democ- 
racy" is  black  (6  percent)  or  of  mulatto  (mixed)  heritage  (38 
percent),  while  at  most  55  percent  is  of  European  (mostly  Por- 
tuguese) descent.  In  socioeconomic  terms,  the  subsistence- 
level  living  standards  of  the  black  population  reflect  a  long  his- 
tory of  racial  discrimination.  Tens  of  millions  of  Brazilians  liv- 
ing in  poverty  are  overwhelmingly  black,  the  descendants  of 
slaves.  Racial  friction  is  a  relatively  new  phenomenon.  Presi- 
dent Cardoso,  author  of  a  classic  study  on  Brazilian  blacks, 
admitted  in  November  1995  that  discrimination  against  blacks 
is  still  a  problem.  For  example,  the  Northeastern  city  of  Salva- 
dor, which  is  80  percent  black,  has  never  had  a  black  mayor. 
Blacks  are  almost  totally  absent  from  high  government  and  mil- 
itary posts,  although  President  Cardoso's  cabinet  has  a  black 
member  (soccer  legend  Pele,  the  minister  of  sports).  Two 
black  women  were  elected  to  the  Senate  in  1994,  but  there 
were  only  eleven  black  federal  deputies  out  of  513  in  Novem- 
ber 1995.  Celso  Pitta,  a  black,  was  elected  mayor  of  Sao  Paulo 
on  October  3,  1996.  Few  blacks  occupy  high  positions  in  busi- 
ness and  other  professions. 

Largely  marginalized  (marginality — -see  Glossary),  Brazil's 
blacks  have  an  illiteracy  rate  twice  that  of  whites  and  an  average 
income  less  than  half  that  of  whites.  Nearly  40  percent  of  non- 
whites  have  four  years  or  less  of  schooling.  Very  few  blacks 
make  it  to  the  university;  blacks  and  mixed-race  people  repre- 
sent a  mere  1  percent  of  the  student  body  at  the  nation's  larg- 
est university,  the  University  of  Sao  Paulo  (Universidade  de  Sao 
Paulo — USP) .  Black  and  mixed-race  Brazilians  were  invisible  in 
the  print  media  until  the  founding  of  BrasilRaca  (Brazil  Race), 
a  magazine  geared  to  them,  in  September  1996  (300,000  cop- 
ies of  the  first  issue  were  sold).

Brazilian  women,  although  constituting  more  than  half  of 
the  population,  traditionally  have  also  been  marginalized  in 
politics.  Only  868  women  out  of  12,800  candidates  ran  in  the 
1994  general  elections.  Only  six  of  eighty-one  senators  and 
only  thirty-four  of  513  deputies  are  women.  Only  171  of  4,973 
mayors  are  women,  and  just  3.5  percent  of  55,000  city  council 
members  nationwide  are  women.  However,  as  a  result  of  a  1995 
quota  law  that  requires  at  least  20  percent  of  the  candidates  of 
each  political  party  to  be  women,  an  estimated  75,000  women 
participated  in  the  October  3,  1996,  election  for  mayors  and 
members  of  city  councils.  According  to  Professor  Fleischer,  for 
the  first  time,  two  state  capitals — Maceio  and  Natal — had  exclu- 
sively female  runoffs,  and  three  other  capitals  had  a  woman  in 
the  runoff.  He  also  noted  that  about  100,000  women  ran  for 
city  council  in  1996,  as  compared  with  only  869  in  1992. 

In  the  countryside,  land  concentration,  landlessness,  home- 
lessness,  and  joblessness  are  major  issues.  At  least  500,000  rural 
jobs  have  been  lost  since  the  government  formally  ended  its 
traditional  protection  of  Brazilian-made  goods  in  1990.  In  the 
early  1990s,  just  under  2  percent  of  farms  occupied  54  percent 
of  arable  land,  while  15  million  campesinos  (see  Glossary) 
worked  farms  with  fewer  than  10  hectares  of  land.  Of  Brazil's  3 
million  rural  properties,  only  58,000  account  for  about  half  the 
farmland.  Moreover,  about  42  percent  of  all  privately  owned 
land  in  Brazil  lies  idle. 

Rural  unions  claim  that  12  million  peasants  are  landless,  a 
figure  that  is  disputed  by  government  officials.  The  Landless 
Movement  (Movimento  dos  Sem-Terra — MST),  now  Brazil's 
most  powerful,  grass-roots  movement,  is  leading  a  pressure 
campaign  on  behalf  of  the  landless.  The  MST  claims  that  4.8 
million  families  have  no  land  but  want  it  and  that  Brazil  has 
78.9  million  hectares  of  fallow  lands,  properties  that  mostly 
belong  to  wealthy  farmers  who  live  in  cities  and  use  the  land 
for  tax  write-offs.  Land  reform  has  been  promised  since  colo- 
nial days,  but  has  yet  to  take  place.  Sociologist  Jose  de  Souza 
Martins  has  described  the  landless  situation  as  the  "conflict 
between  archaic  Brazil  and  modern  Brazil."  Since  its  establish- 
ment in  1980,  the  MST  has  resettled  permanently  150,000  fam- 
ilies on  land  they  originally  occupied  illegally.  Led  by  more 
than  5,000  highly  organized  activists,  the  MST  has  220,000 
members  and  some  4  million  followers.  It  reportedly  enjoys  the 
moral  support  of  up  to  90  percent  of  Brazil's  population.

In  1995  the  MST  stepped  up  its  aggressive  occupations  of 
land.  Encouraged  by  trade  unionists,  left-wing  politicians,  and 
even  Roman  Catholic  clergy,  thousands  of  campesinos  have 
resorted  increasingly  to  land  invasions  to  obtain  a  parcel  to 
farm.  After  the  Military  Police  massacred  nineteen  landless 
activists  in  El  Dorado  de  Carajas,  in  northern  Para  State,  on 
April  17,  1996,  the  Cardoso  government  urged  Congress  to 
give  priority  to  its  agrarian  reform  measures.  In  addition,  Presi- 
dent Cardoso  created  a  new  cabinet-level  ministry,  the  Special 
Ministry  of  Agrarian  Reform.  The  government  claims  to  have 
given  land  to  more  than  100,000  families.  Although  Cardoso 
promised  to  award  land  to  280,000  families  by  the  end  of  1998, 
and  some  60,000  families  had  been  granted  land  by  the  end  of 
1996,  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  voted  in  May  1996  to  halt  his 
land-reform  plans.  Tension  has  continued  to  build  in  the  many 
squatters'  settlements  in  the  countryside. 

The  Cardoso  government  found  itself  at  odds  with  the 
Roman  Catholic  Church  in  the  first  half  of  1997  as  a  result  of 
President  Cardoso's  complaint  to  Pope  John  Paul  II  in  Febru- 
ary that  Brazilian  priests  and  bishops  were  actively  abetting 
MST-organized  land  invasions.  In  late  June  1997,  Cardoso, 
exasperated  with  the  MST,  signed  a  decree  making  govern- 
ment land  expropriations  quicker  and  simpler  but  also  penaliz- 
ing occupation  of  land  by  peasants. 

Landowners  and  miners  have  reacted  violently  to  people 
who  have  gotten  in  their  way.  In  Amazonia  they  have  killed 
numerous  peasants  and  rural  labor  leaders,  including  the 
renowned  rubber  tapper  and  rural  union  leader  Chico 
Mendes,  in  1988.  Alarmed  by  the  MST's  activism,  landowners 
have  turned  to  hired  guns  (pistoleiros)  and  resurrected  an  orga- 
nization linked  in  the  past  with  strong-arm  tactics,  the  Ruralist 
Democratic  Union  (Uniao  Democratica  Ruralista — UDR). 
Apprehensive  that  the  situation  will  only  get  worse  unless  there 
is  an  effective  distribution  of  land,  the  military  reportedly  has 
been  as  anxious  as  the  left  to  see  rapid  implementation  of  land 
reform.  There  has  been  intermittent  violence  resulting  from 
land-reform  problems,  with  much  of  it  occurring  in  Para  State. 
About  1,000  people  were  killed  in  land  conflicts  during  the 
1985-95  period. 

Since  Brazil's  recession  began  to  be  felt  in  1989,  many  rural 
workers  have  fallen  victim  to  another  form  of  violence — slavery 
practices,  involving  imprisonment  for  debt  and  coercion  to 
prevent  workers  from  leaving  their  employers.  According  to 


lxxii 


the  Pastoral  Land  Commission  (Comissao  Pastoral  da  Terra — 
CPT),  a  nonprofit  group  sponsored  by  the  Roman  Catholic 
Church,  documented  cases  of  forced  labor  in  Brazil,  mostly  tak- 
ing place  on  large  estates  called  fazendas,  rose  from  4,883  in 
1991  to  25,193  in  1994.  The  actual  figure  is  believed  to  be 
closer  to  85,000.  In  November  1995,  Brazil,  the  last  Western 
nation  to  abandon  slavery  (in  1888),  celebrated  the  300th 
anniversary  of  Zumbi,  a  seventeenth-century  Afro-Brazilian. 
Zumbi  led  raids  to  free  slaves  from  sugar  plantations  for  more 
than  twenty  years,  using  Palmares,  a  fortress  in  Alagoas  State,  as 
his  base  of  operations. 

The  huge,  widening  gap  between  Brazil's  great  potential  and 
the  reality  of  the  large,  poverty-stricken  majority  of  its  popula- 
tion has  inspired  national  cynicism  about  the  country's  once- 
vaunted  identification  of  its  destiny  with  grandeza.  During 
1992-94  Brazilians  reportedly  were  beset  with  self-doubt,  disil- 
lusionment, and  frustration  at  their  country's  lack  of  progress 
and  were  concerned  that  their  grand  future  would  never 
arrive.  "Brazil  is  the  country  of  the  future — and  always  will  be" 
has  been  a  familiar  Brazilian  aphorism  since  the  early  1960s. 

Beginning  with  the  economic  crisis  of  the  1980s,  many  Bra- 
zilians, including  scientists,  already  had  given  up  on  the  Brazil- 
ian dream  and  moved  abroad.  In  the  second  half  of  the  1980s, 
for  the  first  time  in  the  country's  history,  more  people  emi- 
grated from  Brazil  than  immigrated  to  the  country;  many 
moved  to  Canada  and  the  United  States  (Brazilian  migrants  to 
the  latter  totaled  an  estimated  332,000  by  1994).  An  estimated 
1  million  Brazilians  were  living  overseas  by  1993. 

Entering  the  1990s  with  GDP  per  capita  income  no  higher 
than  it  was  in  1980  and  monthly  inflation  raging  at  an  unprece- 
dented 30  percent,  Brazilians  were  pessimistic  about  their  eco- 
nomic future.  Brazil  was  still  squandering  its  riches,  missing 
opportunities,  and  sinking  deeper  into  misery.  However, 
Fernando  Collor  de  Mello  (president,  1990-92) — young,  ath- 
letic, and  elegant — made  Brazilians  dream  again  with  promises 
to  make  the  country  a  developed  world  power  through  free- 
market  policies  that  would  bring  inflation  under  control,  cre- 
ate high  economic  growth,  and  attract  foreign  investment. 

The  1992  presidential  corruption  scandal  and  subsequent 
impeachment  of  President  Collor  delayed  action  on  economic 
reforms.  In  September  1992,  Brazil  became  the  world's  first 
democratic  country  to  impeach  its  president  on  charges  of  cor- 
ruption. Collor's  downfall  reflected  the  endemic  corruption 


lxxiii 


that  was  undermining  Brazilian  democracy  in  the  early  1990s. 
The  principal  result  of  a  poll  taken  by  the  Gallup  Institute  in 
March  1991  was  that  78  percent  of  Brazilians  surveyed  in  the 
major  cities  remained  convinced  that  Brazil  was  still  a  para- 
dise— for  corruption.  The  reputation  of  the  judicial  system  was 
further  undermined  by  Collor's  acquittal  on  corruption 
charges.  The  crisis  over  Collor's  impeachment  nevertheless 
had  a  positive  side.  As  President  Cardoso  explained  in  an 
address  given  in  New  York  on  October  23,  1995,  it  "clearly  sig- 
naled the  political  maturity  of  a  civic  culture  undergoing  rapid 
consolidation." 

Collor's  replacement,  his  vice  president,  Itamar  Franco 
(president,  1992-94),  a  civil  engineer  by  profession,  was  out  of 
step  with  the  short-lived  Collor  administration's  reform 
agenda.  Initiatives  to  redress  fiscal  problems,  privatize  state 
enterprises,  and  liberalize  trade  and  investment  policies  lost 
momentum.  The  Franco  government  continued  timidly  along 
a  free-market  course,  while  inflation  soared  to  50  percent  a 
month.  By  the  end  of  his  first  year  in  office,  Franco  nearly 
reached  the  vndice  vaia,  or  get-lost  level,  of  unpopularity. 

The  same  Congress  that  ousted  Collor  on  corruption 
charges  became  engulfed  in  its  own  graft  scandal  in  late  1993. 
Judges,  lawyers,  government  officials,  and  politicians  were 
accused  of  conspiring  in  a  US$1.2  billion  scheme  to  defraud 
the  social  security  system  through  inflated  labor  court  settle- 
ments. In  a  poll  taken  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  June  1993,  respon- 
dents ranked  Congress  near  the  bottom  (15  percent)  of  a  list  of 
Brazilian  institutions  that  earned  their  trust;  political  parties 
had  the  least  credibility  (5  percent),  while  the  military  ranked 
near  the  top,  with  58  percent. 

By  the  end  of  1993,  the  National  Accounting  Court  (Tribu- 
nal das  Contas  da  Uniao — TCU)  had  investigated  and  found 
that  1,500  current  and  retired  politicians  were  unfit  to  hold 
office,  again  because  of  corruption.  A  report  produced  by  the 
Congressional  Investigating  Committee  (Comissao  Parlamen- 
tar  de  Inquerito — CPI)  named  nine  firms  that  it  said  had 
defrauded  the  government  systematically  since  1985.  The  CPI 
claimed  that  fifty-five  politicians  were  part  of  the  secret  cartel, 
as  well  as  all  the  governors  of  the  sixteen  North  and  Northeast 
states,  with  the  exception  of  Ceara's  governor,  Ciro  Gomes. 

In  December  1993,  President  Franco's  fourth  minister  of 
finance,  Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso,  unveiled  his  controver- 
sial stabilization  plan  (Brazil's  seventh  since  1986),  which 


lxxiv 


caused  a  furor  over  its  proposal  to  raise  taxes.  Nevertheless, 
Cardoso  accomplished  an  essential  first  step  in  implementing 
this  plan,  restoring  order  to  public  finances,  and  eliminating 
the  estimated  US$22.2  billion  budget  deficit  (5  percent  of 
GDP).  Cardoso  pressured  Congress  in  February  1994  to  pass  a 
constitutional  amendment  setting  up  a  US$16  billion  Social 
Emergency  Fund  (Fundo  Social  de  Emergencia — FSE), 
renamed  the  Fiscal  Stabilization  Fund  (Fundo  de  Estabilizacao 
Fiscal — FEF),  to  be  financed  by  tax  increases.  Official  figures 
show  how  skewed  the  economy  had  become,  thanks  to  the 
unbridled  growth  of  bureaucracy. 

A  few  days  after  announcing  his  presidential  candidacy  on 
March  30,  1994,  Minster  of  Finance  Cardoso  launched  the 
third  phase  of  his  financial  package,  the  Real  Stabilization  Plan 
(Piano  Real).  It  consisted  of  three  stages:  the  introduction  of  an 
equilibrium  budget  mandated  by  Congress;  a  process  of  gen- 
eral indexation  (prices,  wages,  taxes,  contracts,  and  financial 
assets);  and  the  introduction  of  a  new  currency,  the  real, 
pegged  to  the  dollar,  on  July  1,  1994. 

The  legally  enforced  balanced  budget  would  remove  expec- 
tations of  inflationary  behavior  by  the  vast  public  sector,  which 
includes  the  national  telephone  company,  many  public  utility 
companies,  and  several  banks.  By  allowing  a  realignment  of  rel- 
ative prices,  general  indexation  would  pave  the  way  for  mone- 
tary reform.  Through  monetary  and  fiscal  adjustments,  the 
RealFlan  succeeded  in  reducing  inflation,  which  was  ascending 
at  a  stratospheric  rate  of  7,000  percent  a  year,  to  almost  2  per- 
cent by  that  October. 

By  September  1994,  Cardoso  had  become  the  embodiment 
of  Brazil's  economic  transformation.  Cardoso's  spectacularly 
successful  Real  Plan  (which  he  coauthored  with  Pedro  Malan, 
who  later  became  his  minister  of  finance)  propelled  him  to  a 
resounding  presidential  victory  in  the  first  round  of  the  Octo- 
ber 3,  1994,  election.  Voters  were  forced  to  choose  between  a 
social  democratic,  free-market  model  of  modernization  and  a 
reworked  model  of  corporatist  (corporatism — see  Glossary)  or 
syndicalist  socialism.  The  former  was  advocated  by  Cardoso  of 
the  Brazilian  Social  Democracy  Party  (Partido  da  Social 
Democracia  Brasileira — PSDB)  and  the  latter  by  Luis  Inacio 
"Lula"  da  Silva  of  the  Workers'  Party  (Partido  dos  Trabal- 
hadores — PT) .  Striking  alliances  to  the  right  of  his  own  PSDB, 
Cardoso  marginalized  the  previously  favored  Lula.

The  82.2  percent  voter  turnout  for  the  1994  presidential 
election  was  impressive  (as  compared  with  the  United  States). 
Cardoso,  a  former  tucano  (Sao  Paulo)  senator  and  minister  of 
finance,  placed  first  in  every  state  except  the  Federal  District 
and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  where  Lula,  a  grade-school  dropout 
and  long-time  lathe  operator,  was  victorious.  Cardoso  was  aided 
by  the  support  of  not  only  the  poor  but  also  conservative  par- 
ties, Sao  Paulo  industrialists,  and  the  powerful  media  network 
of  Rede  Globo.  In  the  congressional  and  gubernatorial  elec- 
tions, all  513  seats  in  the  lower  house,  the  Chamber  of  Deputies 
(Camara  dos  Deputados),  and  fifty-four  of  the  eighty-one  Sen- 
ate seats  were  up  for  reelection.  However,  Cardoso  supporters 
were  deprived  of  a  first-round  victory  in  Sao  Paulo,  Minas 
Gerais,  and  Rio  de  Janeiro,  where  abstentions  and  spoilt  or 
blank  votes  accounted  for  more  than  half  the  total. 

One  of  the  most  academically  qualified  presidents  in  history 
and  a  brilliant  intellectual,  Cardoso  is  a  world-renowned  sociol- 
ogist and  the  author  of  more  than  100  monographs,  including 
two  dozen  books,  many  of  them  written  in  English.  In  addition 
to  Portuguese,  Cardoso  speaks  English,  French,  Spanish,  and 
several  other  foreign  languages.  His  wife,  Ruth  Correa  Leite 
Cardoso,  is  a  leading  Brazilian  urban  anthropologist  who  spe- 
cializes in  studying  community  movements  by  women  and 
blacks  in  Sao  Paulo's  favelas  and  who  heads  the  Solidarity  Com- 
munity (Comunidade  Solidaria)  social-action  program. 

For  most  of  his  life,  Cardoso  was  a  university  professor.  He 
taught  at  the  USP  until  1964,  when  the  new  military  regime 
persecuted  him  and  banned  him  from  teaching.  He  then  chose 
to  go  into  exile  in  Santiago,  Chile,  from  1964  to  1968.  During 
that  period,  he  coauthored,  with  Chilean  sociologist  Enzo  Fal- 
etto,  Dependency  and  Development  in  Latin  America,  considered 
one  of  the  most  influential  interpretations  of  twentieth-century 
Latin  American  structural  dynamics.  It  attributes  Latin  Amer- 
ica's underdevelopment  to  the  once-influential  doctrine  that 
Cardoso  cofounded,  dependency  theory  (see  Glossary),  and 
the  region's  dependence  on  foreign  capital  and  technology. 

Cardoso  also  taught  in  France  at  the  University  of  Paris  (the 
Sorbonne),  Britain  (Oxford),  and  the  United  States  (Univer- 
sity of  California-Berkeley,  Princeton,  Stanford,  and  Yale).  In 
the  1970s,  he  became  the  best-known  critic  of  the  Brazilian 
nationalistic  developmental  model,  which  was  based  on  the 
now  obsolete  strategy  of  state-led  import-substitution  industri- 
alization (see  Glossary).  In  the  early  1970s,  when  Cardoso  dis- 


lxxvi 


tributed  pamphlets  outside  factory  gates,  Brazilian  business- 
men viewed  him  suspiciously  as  an  unreliable  leftist  politician. 
Returning  to  Sao  Paulo  by  the  late  1970s,  he  established  a  think 
tank  and  entered  politics  in  1977.  He  served  as  a  senator 
(1986-94),  and,  in  1988,  helped  to  found  the  PSDB,  a  center- 
left  party  that  opposed  corruption. 

As  the  son,  grandson,  and  nephew  of  generals,  Cardoso 
retains  strong  ties  to  the  military.  His  father,  General  Leonidas 
Cardoso,  was  elected  deputy  by  the  Communist  Party  of  Brazil 
(Partido  Comunista  do  Brasil — PC  do  B)  in  the  1940s  and  was 
persecuted  by  the  military.  President  Cardoso's  grandfather, 
General  Mauricio  Cardoso,  was  considered  to  have  been  the 
most  brilliant  officer  of  the  Brazilian  Army  (Exercito 
Brasileiro).  Fernando  Cardoso's  uncle,  General  Henrique 
Assuncao  Cardoso,  has  been  characterized  as  an  extreme  right- 
ist. In  1969  Cardoso  himself  was  arrested,  blindfolded,  and 
interrogated  by  the  military. 

After  three  civilian  presidents  of  mediocre  abilities,  many 
Brazilians  who  had  been  despondent  about  their  country's  eco- 
nomic future  viewed  Cardoso's  election  as  highly  auspicious  for 
Brazil,  and  most  foreign  observers  agreed.  Fellow  sociologist 
Alain  Touraine,  a  professor  at  the  Maison  des  Sciences  de 
l'Homme  in  Paris,  commented  to  0  Est  ado  de  Sao  Paulo  that 
Cardoso's  election  represented  a  victory  of  the  future  over  the 
past  at  a  moment  in  which  the  entire  world  is  engaged  in  eco- 
nomic "globalization,"  a  road  that  Brazil  had  rejected  thirty 
years  earlier.  In  addition  to  stabilizing  the  country  economi- 
cally, Cardoso  was  expected  to  stabilize  Brazil's  erratic  record  of 
incomplete  presidencies.  Not  a  single  democratically  elected 
Brazilian  president  had  completed  his  term  of  office  since 
1926;  the  presidents  either  resigned,  were  forced  from  office, 
or,  in  one  case  (Getulio  Dorneles  Vargas,  president,  1930-45, 
1951-54),  committed  suicide. 

By  the  time  Cardoso  assumed  office  on  January  1,  1995,  at 
age  sixty-three,  the  monthly  rate  of  inflation  was  less  than  1 
percent,  unemployment  was  low  (about  5  percent),  and  Brazil 
had  a  comfortable  and  unprecedented  level  of  foreign- 
exchange  reserves,  at  a  record  US$40.8  billion,  thanks  largely 
to  the  influx  of  foreign  capital  into  the  local  financial  market. 
The  conditions  were  favorable  for  essential  reforms  of  the  stat- 
ist economy,  the  bloated  federal  government,  and  the  overgen- 
erous  pension  system.  The  latter  had  allowed  privileged 
groups — teachers,  airline  pilots,  soldiers,  judges,  journalists, 


lxxvii 


and  politicians  (politicians  after  only  eight  years) — to  qualify 
for  100  percent  pensions  in  their  fifties  (some  at  age  forty-five 
on  a  pension  20  percent  higher  than  their  last  wage) .  One  gov- 
ernor complained  in  October  1995  about  a  retired  Military 
Police  colonel  who  had  accumulated  twenty-six  personal  pen- 
sions and  was  drawing  the  equivalent  of  US$80,400  a  month. 
By  January  1995,  the  pension  system  was  running  an  estimated 
annual  deficit  of  10  percent  of  GDP,  or  US$3  billion. 

Whereas  the  public  sector's  wages  accounted  for  only  3  per- 
cent of  GDP  in  1980,  the  government  in  1993  employed  one- 
third  of  the  total  workforce  and  paid  11  percent  of  GDP  in 
wages.  In  1995  the  federal  bureaucracy's  wage  bill  rose  by  40 
percent,  and  states  were  spending  80  to  90  percent  of  their 
income  on  running  the  bureaucracy.  The  bloated  bureaucracy 
is  filled  with  thousands  of  nominal  workers  who  receive  salaries 
but  do  no  work.  The  state  governors,  desperate  to  get  thou- 
sands of  civil  servants  off  the  state  payrolls,  have  been  Car- 
doso's most  resolute  allies  in  the  battle  for  administrative 
reform  and  capping  bureaucratic  expenses  at  60  percent  of  the 
government's  revenues.  However,  privatization  of  state-owned 
companies  is  opposed  by  associations  of  civil  servants  reluctant 
to  lose  their  privileges,  particularly  the  officers  (maharajas)  in 
charge  of  state  companies  who  are  paid  salaries  (up  to 
US$19,000  a  month)  that  are  high  by  Latin  American  corpo- 
rate standards.  (In  late  1995,  there  were  6,471  civil  servants  in 
seven  states  earning  more  than  President  Cardoso's  salary  of 
US$8,800  a  month.) 

Cardoso's  election  also  marked  an  ethical  backlash  to  institu- 
tionalized corruption  by  traditional  politicians,  a  reversal  that 
began  with  the  ouster  of  Collor.  A  report  by  government  inves- 
tigators published  on  January  1,  1995,  noted  that  corruption 
within  the  Brazilian  government  was  costing  the  country  about 
US$20  billion  and  accounting  for  40  percent  of  the  national 
investment  budget.  Cardoso  refused  to  trade  20,000  to  30,000 
patronage  jobs  for  congressional  support,  vowing  to  fill  the 
jobs  with  qualified  nonpoliticians  to  avoid  corruption  and  to 
control  spending.  Cardoso's  government  sought  to  circumvent 
the  corruption-ridden  state  and  federal  cronies  by  transferring 
most  of  the  responsibility  and  funding  of  health,  schools,  and 
infrastructure  to  municipal  authorities.  Nevertheless,  corrup- 
tion has  remained  entrenched  in  the  bureaucracy. 

In  his  first  100  days  in  office,  Cardoso  was  unable  to  deal 
effectively  with  the  status  quo  forces  in  Congress,  causing  a  fur- 


lxxviii 


ther  loss  of  public  confidence  in  democracy.  A  poll  conducted 
in  April  1995  indicated  that  the  percentage  of  Brazilians  prefer- 
ring democracy  to  any  other  form  of  government  declined 
from  54  percent  in  the  previous  September  to  46  percent,  and 
the  proportion  regarding  a  dictatorship  as  better  than  democ- 
racy rose  from  13  percent  to  18  percent. 

In  1996-97  President  Cardoso  attempted  to  further  reform 
the  constitution  in  order  to  reduce  the  state's  role  in  the  econ- 
omy, revamp  the  federal  bureaucracy,  reorganize  the  social 
security  system,  redefine  the  federal-state  relationship,  simplify 
the  tax  system,  and  strengthen  political  parties.  He  succeeded 
in  getting  some  major  economic  and  political  reforms  enacted. 
Discarding  the  anticapitalist,  theoretical  nostrums  that  he  had 
espoused  during  his  academic  career,  he  called  for  the  imple- 
mentation of  a  sweeping  market-oriented  reform,  including 
public-sector  and  fiscal  reform,  privatization,  deregulation,  and 
elimination  of  barriers  to  increased  foreign  investment. 

Cardoso's  goals  are  to  expand  privatization  measures, 
including  elimination  of  constitutionally  established  monopo- 
lies. His  initial  economic  reforms,  adopted  by  the  Congress  in 
early  1995,  permit  the  entry  of  foreign  capital  into  previously 
exclusive  areas,  categorized  as  "strategic  assets."  These  may 
include  the  oil  extraction,  mining,  and  telecommunications, 
and  the  banking,  electricity,  health,  insurance,  and  retirement- 
plan  sectors.  Privatization  sales  in  1996  may  have  reached 
US$10.2  billion.  On  May  21,  1996,  a  consortium  of  Brazilian, 
French,  and  United  States  companies  purchased  a  34  percent 
share  of  the  state-owned  Power  Services,  Inc.  (Servicos  de  Ele- 
tricidade  S.A. — Light)  in  a  transaction  valued  at  US$2.2  billion, 
Brazil's  then  largest  privatization.  Cardoso  administration  offi- 
cials hoped  the  sale  of  Light  would  revitalize  Brazil's  often  criti- 
cized, delay-prone  privatization  program. 

By  April  1997,  the  government  had  sold  fifty-five  of  135  state- 
owned  companies  for  a  total  of  at  least  US$15  billion,  since  the 
inception  of  the  program  in  1991,  including  all  of  its  steel  com- 
panies. Most  of  those  sales  attracted  little  attention. 

In  early  May  1997,  however,  in  Latin  America's  largest,  most 
historic  privatization  to  date,  the  government  sold  its  45  per- 
cent controlling  stake  in  the  Rio  Doce  Valley  Company,  Inc. 
(Companhia  Vale  do  Rio  Doce  S.A. — CVRD)  to  a  consortium 
led  by  Brazil's  largest  steelmaker,  the  already  privatized 
National  Iron  and  Steel  Company  (Companhia  Siderurgica 
Nacional— CSN),  for  US$3.1  billion.  Vale,  as  the  firm  is  known, 


lxxix 


is  the  world's  third  largest  mining  company;  it  is  the  largest 
producer  and  exporter  of  iron  ore  (accounting  for  more  than 
18  percent  of  the  global  market,  or  100  million  tons  annually, 
with  reserves  of  4  to  5  billion  tons)  and  Latin  America's  biggest 
producer  of  gold  (eighteen  tons  a  year).  Vale  is  also  Brazil's 
largest  exporter  (US$1.2  billion  in  overseas  sales  in  1996)  and  a 
symbol  of  Brazilian  nationalism.  In  addition  to  its  railroad  sys- 
tem, which  carries  almost  two-thirds  of  Brazil's  rail  freight,  Vale 
owns  two  ports  (Sao  Luis  and  Vitoria).  The  government 
planned  to  sell  its  remaining  31.5  percent  of  ordinary  shares  in 
Vale,  a  company  valued  at  US$11.7  billion,  in  late  1997.  Some 
Brazilians  protested  the  expected  loss  of  Vale's  tradition  of  pro- 
viding jobs  and  grants  for  cultural  and  other  activities. 

Other  giant  state  companies  were  slated  for  privatization, 
including  Sao  Paulo  Power,  Inc.  (Eletricidade  de  Sao  Paulo 
S.A. — Eletropaulo),  which  sells  15  percent  of  all  of  Latin  Amer- 
ica's electricity,  and  Brazilian  Electric  Power  Company,  Inc. 
(Centrais  Eletricas  Brasileiras  S.A. — Eletrobras),  one  of  the 
world's  top  five  power  companies.  Brazil's  largest  company,  the 
Brazilian  Petroleum  Corporation  (Petroleo  Brasileiro  S.A. — 
Petrobras),  with  sales  of  US$18  billion,  is  the  world's  fifteenth 
largest  oil  and  natural  gas  company  and  a  world  leader  in  deep- 
sea  drilling.  Nevertheless,  the  inefficient  Petrobras  faced  a  pro- 
cess of  accelerated  deregulation  in  1997  that  may  open  the 
country's  vast  resources  to  joint  exploration  and  development 
by  foreign  multinational  oil  companies. 

The  opening  of  the  telecommunications  sector  to  foreign 
private  investment  capital  actually  will  not  become  effective 
until  the  next  government  takes  office  in  1999.  Under  the  Car- 
doso government's  proposed  new  regulations,  as  approved  by 
the  Chamber  of  Deputies  in  May  1996,  foreign  private  compa- 
nies would  be  permitted  to  purchase  up  to  49  percent  in  voting 
shares  of  state-owned  telecommunications  companies.  Thus, 
new  international  joint  ventures  are  changing  the  face  of  Bra- 
zil's long-introverted  business  world.  The  government 
expected  to  receive  US$25  billion  to  US$30  billion  from  the 
privatization  of  telecommunications  in  1997-99. 

The  telephone  business  is  one  of  the  largest  Brazilian  indus- 
tries to  be  opened  to  foreign  investors.  In  April  1997,  in  a  move 
that  was  a  precursor  to  the  planned  privatization  in  1998  of  the 
state-controlled  telephone  holding  company,  Brazilian  Tele- 
communications, Inc.  (Telecomunicacoes  Brasileiras  S.A. — 
Telebras),  which  could  establish  Brazil  as  a  major  destination 


lxxx 


for  foreign  investment,  the  government  auctioned  off  the 
regional  cellular  foreign  investment  concessions  for  minimum 
prices  totaling  US$3.6  billion.  In  addition  to  electrical  genera- 
tion and  transmission  companies,  the  government  planned  to 
sell  banks,  railroads,  and  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  Metro  in  late  1997. 

With  its  large  and  quite  diversified  economy,  Brazil  still  has 
the  potential  to  regain  its  former  dynamism,  despite  the  econ- 
omy's considerable  structural  and  short-term  problems. 
According  to  some  economists,  radical  fiscal  reforms  are  cru- 
cial to  the  consolidation  of  Brazilian  economic  stability  and  to 
lay  the  groundwork  for  self-sustained  economic  growth.  The 
goals  of  these  reforms  are  to  redefine  the  scope  of  the  Brazilian 
nation,  its  functional  profile,  and  the  extent  of  interaction  with 
the  private  sector.  Reducing  the  unsustainable  disparities  in 
income  distribution  is  considered  to  be  an  essential  compo- 
nent of  overdue  structural  reforms.  However,  political  factors 
have  slowed  the  Cardoso  administration's  progress  on  vital 
structural  reform. 

The  RealFlan  imposed  a  harsh  new  period  of  constricted 
profits  and  consolidation  on  Brazil's  banks.  The  banking  sec- 
tor, employing  960,000,  began  to  downsize.  In  1994-95  the 
Franco  and  Cardoso  governments  intervened  in  many  banks 
and  closed  more  than  a  dozen  others.  In  August  1995,  the  Cen- 
tral Bank  of  Brazil  (Banco  Central  do  Brasil — Bacen;  see  Glos- 
sary) was  forced  to  take  over  the  giant  Economic  Bank  (Banco 
Economico),  Brazil's  first  private  bank,  based  in  the  Northeast 
state  of  Bahia,  after  it  ran  up  debts  of  US$3.6  billion.  After  his 
approval  ratings  and  Brazil's  stock  market  plummeted  at  the 
news  of  the  federal  bailout,  Cardoso  reversed  course  and 
instead  sought  to  sell  the  bank  to  private  investors.  The  Car- 
doso government  also  intervened  to  put  the  Sao  Paulo  State 
Bank  (Banco  do  Estado  de  Sao  Paulo — Banespa),  which  owed 
domestic  and  foreign  lenders  US$58  billion,  under  Central 
Bank  control  to  save  it  from  collapse  and  to  put  the  Rio  de 
Janeiro  State  Bank  (Banco  do  Estado  de  Rio  de  Janeiro — Ban- 
erj)  on  the  auction  block.  A  US$12  billion  government  rescue 
package  for  private  banks  that  was  introduced  in  late  1995  laid 
the  groundwork  for  a  wave  of  mergers,  privatizations,  and  liqui- 
dations. 

By  the  end  of  1995,  President  Cardoso,  by  employing  prag- 
matic, free-market  economics,  had  led  Brazil's  inflation-prone 
economy  to  its  greatest  stability  in  a  quarter  century.  Cardoso's 
continued  popularity  resulted  in  large  part  from  his  ingenious 


lxxxi 


handling  of  the  economy.  In  the  first  twelve  months  of  the  new 
currency,  the  real  and  its  associated  fiscal  measures  brought 
strong  growth,  a  flood  of  new  investment,  the  creation  of  half  a 
million  new  jobs,  a  temporary  fall  in  unemployment,  and  an 
inflation  rate  of  less  than  25.9  percent  a  year.  Nevertheless,  the 
widening  public  deficit,  combined  with  congressional  resis- 
tance to  the  three  reforms  submitted  by  the  Cardoso  govern- 
ment in  the  second  half  of  1995 — administrative,  tax,  and 
social  security  reform — threatened  to  undermine  Cardoso's 
Real  Plan.  In  the  view  of  Cardoso's  critics,  he  missed  his  chance 
for  radical  reform  of  the  state  by  failing  to  move  aggressively  at 
the  outset  of  his  administration. 

By  1996  Brazil's  high  public  deficit  (4  percent  of  GDP)  from 
a  rising  public  payroll,  high  interest  rates,  the  mounting  for- 
eign debt-service  costs  (US$15  billion  in  1996)  and  amortisa- 
tions (US$18  billion),  and  the  high  level  of  social  security 
payments  were  of  increasing  concern  to  investors.  The  cost  of 
social  security  payments  rose  from  US$25.4  billion  in  1994  to 
US$32.9  billion  in  1995.  Social  security  showed  a  deficit  of  R$5 
billion  in  1996.  Some  analysts  have  expressed  concern  that  the 
deterioration  of  the  fiscal  situation  at  the  same  time  that  credit 
is  being  regenerated  to  restart  the  economy  adds  up  to  a  dan- 
gerous combination,  considering  that  the  pace  of  structural 
reform  has  apparently  slowed  down.  In  this  view,  Brazil  faces  a 
volatile  situation  reminiscent  of  Mexico  in  1994.  Economist 
Sebastian  Edwards  contended  in  a  Wall  Street  Journal  op-ed  on 
November  7,  1997,  that  "without  immediate  action  on  the  fiscal 
side,  the  Real  Plan  may  be  unsustainable."  Other  analysts 
believe  that  the  deficit  problem  looks  worse  than  it  really  is. 

Cardoso's  RealYXan  succeeded  in  reducing  inflation  to  16.5 
percent  in  1996,  the  lowest  in  nearly  half  a  century,  thanks  to 
an  overvalued  currency.  Brazilians  began  to  take  economic  sta- 
bility for  granted.  However,  since  early  1996  some  economists 
have  warned  that  Brazil's  exchange  rate  is  too  high.  In  June 
1996,  economist  Rudiger  Dornbusch,  who  predicted  the  1994 
Mexican  peso  crash,  suggested  that  the  raz/was  overvalued  by 
about  40  percent.  In  his  analysis,  which  angered  Brazilian  offi- 
cials and  instigated  a  debate,  Brazil  has  been  controlling  infla- 
tion by  means  of  a  highly  overvalued  currency  and  high 
interest  rates.  Conservative  economists  led  by  Deputy  Antonio 
Delfim  Netto  (PPB),  a  former  minister  of  planning,  called  for 
accelerated  devaluation.  In  the  view  of  these  skeptical  econo- 
mists, the  Cardoso  government's  economic  policy  dooms  Brazil 


lxxxii 


to  remaining  the  country  of  the  future.  By  some  estimates,  the 
real  in  early  1998  was  overvalued  by  15  percent.  Whether  Brazil 
can  continue  to  sustain  a  monetary  and  exchange-rate  policy 
that  is  inconsistent  with  its  large  and  growing  budget  deficits 
without  a  major  devaluation  remains  to  be  seen.  Some  econo- 
mists expect  a  devaluation  in  1998. 

For  much  of  1997,  Brazil  continued  to  enjoy  its  greatest  sta- 
bility in  three  decades,  with  foreign  reserves  totaling  US$57.5 
billion  by  May.  However,  the  growing  trade  deficit,  which 
reached  US$10.93  billion  in  1997,  had  become  a  top  concern 
of  the  government.  In  1997  the  current  account  deficit  rose  to 
US$32.3  billion.  Of  the  main  Latin  American  economies,  only 
Brazil  in  1997  had  a  fiscal  deficit  as  high  as  3.4  percent  of  its 
GDP. 

Forced  to  choose  between  lower  economic  growth  (esti- 
mated to  be  3.2  percent  in  1997)  and  a  quick  currency  devalua- 
tion, which  might  aggravate  inflation,  Brazil's  economic  policy 
makers  chose  the  former.  In  early  November  1997,  President 
Cardoso  staved  off  financial  speculators,  who  tried  to  force  Bra- 
zil to  devalue  the  real,  by  quickly  raising  interest  rates  and  prop- 
ping up  the  raz/with  billions  of  dollars  in  reserves.  He  then 
unveiled  an  economic  austerity  package  that  will  include 
higher  taxes  and  reduced  government  spending.  By  announc- 
ing a  series  of  fifty-one  drastic  measures  to  bolster  revenues  by 
as  much  as  US$18  billion,  Cardoso  demonstrated  decisive  lead- 
ership and  a  willingness  to  take  tough  measures  to  maintain 
confidence  in  the  real  To  that  end,  his  government  won  an 
important  legislative  victory  on  November  20  with  the  approval 
by  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  of  a  key  constitutional  reform  pro- 
posal to  dismantle  job  protection  for  most  civil  service  workers 
by  giving  the  government  new  powers  to  dismiss  them.  The  bill, 
which  was  expected  to  win  approval  in  the  Senate,  would  even- 
tually cost  about  280,000  of  537,053  public  servants  their  jobs, 
thereby  eliminating  a  major  impediment  to  the  country's  fiscal 
health. 

As  a  result  of  the  1996  municipal  elections  and  strong  oppo- 
sition by  powerful  vested  interest  groups,  the  Cardoso  adminis- 
tration's more  challenging  reforms — administrative,  social 
security,  and  fiscal — languished  in  Congress  and  awaited  pas- 
sage in  1997.  The  opposition  that  Cardoso's  bill  to  reform  the 
deficit-ridden  social  security  and  pension  systems  encountered 
in  Congress,  among  the  state  governors,  and  even  in  the 
Supreme  Court  has  highlighted  the  constraints  under  which  a 


lxxxiii 


Brazilian  president  operates.  In  January  1998,  the  Cardoso 
administration  estimated  that  Congress  would  approve  the 
social  security  bill  by  April.  In  addition  to  the  social  security  bill 
and  a  new  labor  reform  proposal,  the  Cardoso  government 
resubmitted  its  proposed  administrative  and  fiscal  reforms  to 
Congress.  The  lower  house  approved  the  basic  text  of  the 
administrative  reform  on  November  19,  1997. 

Despite  congressional  resistance  to  his  reform  proposals, 
President  Cardoso  further  consolidated  his  power  in  early  Feb- 
ruary 1997  when  his  candidates  for  the  positions  of  speaker  in 
both  houses  of  Congress  were  elected.  This  led  some  observers 
to  wonder  whether  the  presidency  was  entering  a  de  facto 
imperial  era.  Referring  to  "Emperor  Cardoso,"  political  analyst 
Villas-Boas  Correia  argued  in  a  Jornal  do  Brasil  article  that  no 
democratically  elected  president  had  ever  accumulated  so 
much  power  in  Brazilian  history. 

In  January  1997,  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  passed  an  amend- 
ment allowing  for  immediate  reelection  of  presidents,  gover- 
nors, and  mayors.  As  a  result  of  the  Senate's  approval  of  the 
amendment  in  June  1997,  President  Cardoso  may  stand  for 
reelection  in  October  1998.  His  main  opponent  was  Paulo 
Maluf,  a  right-wing  populist  and  erstwhile  presidential  candi- 
date of  the  Brazilian  Progressive  Party  (Partido  Progressista 
Brasileiro — PPB),  as  well  as  the  largest  party  in  Congress,  the 
Brazilian  Democratic  Movement  Party  (Partido  do  Movimento 
Democratico  Brasileiro — PMDB).  However,  Maluf  decided  that 
Cardoso  was  still  too  popular  to  run  against,  so  he  entered  the 
race  for  governor  of  Sao  Paulo  State  instead.  On  November  30, 
1997,  Luis  Inacio  da  Silva  announced  officially  that  he  will  run 
for  president  on  the  Workers'  Party  ticket.  But  Cardoso's  efforts 
to  maintain  a  low  rate  of  inflation,  expand  the  economy,  make 
progress  in  solving  major  socioeconomic  problems,  and  reduce 
corruption  and  congressional  immunity  have  lowered  the  left's 
chances  of  being  elected  to  power  in  the  October-November 
1998  presidential,  congressional,  and  state  elections.  Cardoso's 
reelection  is  generally  considered  likely. 

Brazilian  diplomacy  had  a  landmark  year  in  1995  with  Car- 
doso's assumption  of  office.  The  first  former  minister  of  for- 
eign affairs  to  be  elected  president  of  Brazil,  Cardoso 
personally  led  Brazil's  most  important  diplomatic  initiatives  in 
1995,  bringing  new  credibility  and  respect  to  Brazilian  foreign 
policy  and  the  country's  international  relations  profile.  Having 
redefined  Brazil's  foreign  policy  objectives,  the  Cardoso  gov- 


lxxxiv 


ernment  improved  Brazil's  relations  with  the  United  States  and 
adopted  a  more  assertive  role  within  the  South  American 
region. 

Brazil's  priority  in  1995-97  was  to  consolidate  Mercosul 
(Common  Market  of  the  South)  among  Argentina,  Brazil,  Par- 
aguay, and  Uruguay.  In  the  four  years  before  Mercosul  took 
effect  on  January  1,  1995,  regional  trade  almost  tripled,  reach- 
ing US$10  billion  by  the  end  of  1994,  as  compared  with  only 
US$3.6  billion  in  trade  among  the  four  full  member  countries 
in  1990.  Exports  to  Mercosul  countries  accounted  for  15  per- 
cent of  Brazil's  total  in  1995,  as  compared  with  13  percent  in 
1994.  Mean  tariff  rates  were  cut  back  from  32.2  percent  in  1990 
to  14.0  percent  in  1994,  while  at  the  same  time  the  tariff  ceiling 
was  brought  down  from  105  percent  to  40  percent.  Trade 
between  Brazil  and  Argentina  in  1995  was  US$10  billion, 
amounting  to  80  percent  of  all  trade  within  Mercosul  and  mak- 
ing Argentina  Brazil's  second  largest  trading  partner,  after  the 
United  States. 

In  addition  to  removing  trade  barriers,  Mercosul  commits 
members  to  the  coordination  of  policies  on  agriculture,  indus- 
try, transport,  finance,  and  monetary  affairs.  Argentina  and 
Brazil  see  Mercosul  primarily  as  a  means  of  attracting  foreign 
investment.  Although  Brazil's  Mercosul  partners  were  shocked 
when  Brazil  announced  on  March  25,  1997,  its  unilateral  deci- 
sion to  impose  restrictions  on  imports,  Brazil  alleviated  fears  of 
a  trade  shutdown  by  allowing  an  exemption  for  Mercosul 
goods. 

Cardoso  made  a  very  successful  state  visit  to  Washington  in 
April  1995.  The  Clinton  administration  welcomed  Brazil's  con- 
stitutional amendments  opening  up  the  Brazilian  economy  to 
increased  international  participation,  especially  the  breaking 
up  of  state  monopolies  in  the  areas  of  petroleum  and  telecom- 
munications, but  intellectual  property  rights  remained  at  issue. 
Veja  reported  in  mid-April  1995  that  United  States  firms  were 
losing  US$800  million  a  year  as  a  result  of  piracy  by  Brazilian 
companies.  However,  the  Cardoso  government  subsequently 
modified  Brazil's  intellectual  property  rights  law  to  coincide 
with  stricter  trademark  and  patent  provisions.  The  new  Patents 
Law,  enacted  in  1996,  meets  international  standards.  Neverthe- 
less, Brazil's  software  piracy  rate  was  about  68  percent,  account- 
ing for  nearly  seven  of  every  ten  computer  software  programs 
sold  in  the  country,  according  to  a  Price  Waterhouse  study 
released  in  May  1997.  During  his  official  visit  to  Brasilia  and 


lxxxv 


Rio  de  Janeiro  in  mid-October  1977,  President  Clinton  empha- 
sized trade,  education,  and  environmental  issues  and  suc- 
ceeded in  improving  Brazilian-United  States  relations. 

Brazil's  history  has  been  relatively  free  from  major  conflict 
with  its  ten  contiguous  neighbors,  with  the  main  exception  of 
the  War  of  the  Triple  Alliance  (1864-70)  with  Paraguay.  In  the 
twentieth  century,  Brazil  has  been  a  gentle  giant;  the  only 
major  power  with  which  Brazil  has  fought  a  war  was  Germany 
in  World  War  II.  After  the  war,  however,  1,500  Nazis,  including 
the  infamous  Josef  Mengele,  moved  to  Brazil,  according  to  the 
World  Jewish  Congress.  Moreover,  Rio  de  Janeiro's  O  Globo 
reported  in  early  1997  that  President  Vargas,  a  Nazi  sympa- 
thizer, confiscated  US$46  million  in  assets  from  Brazilian  Jews 
in  1947.  In  April  1997,  President  Cardoso  created  a  special 
commission  charged  with  investigating  Nazi  assets. 

In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  Brazil's  national  security  inter- 
ests were  reshaped  not  only  by  the  new,  post-regime  civil-mili- 
tary relationship,  but  also  by  Brazil's  greatly  improved 
integration  with  Argentina  and  other  South  American  coun- 
tries through  various  security  accords  and  a  regional  trade 
agreement,  Mercosul.  One  of  the  Collor  administration's  most 
important  national  security  actions  aimed  at  the  Brazilian 
Armed  Forces  (Forcas  Armadas  Brasileiras)  was  to  expose  the 
military's  secret  nuclear  bomb  program,  the  so-called  Parallel 
Program  (Programa  Paralelo),  and  bring  it  under  civilian  over- 
sight and  international  monitoring.  On  December  13,  1991, 
Brazil  reached  a  nuclear  cooperation  accord  with  Argentina, 
thereby  accepting  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA) 
safeguards. 

President  Collor  also  implemented  other  significant 
national  security  measures.  He  continued  to  reduce  defense 
spending  to  the  lowest  level  in  decades  and  allowed  the  coun- 
try's arms  industry  to  collapse  without  any  state  intervention  to 
sustain  it.  For  example,  the  Collor  administration  announced 
that  the  Brazilian  Aeronautics  Company  (Empresa  Brasileira 
Aeronautica — Embraer),  the  producer  of  planes  such  as  the 
Tucano  trainer  and  the  subsonic  AMX  jet,  would  be  privatized. 
In  an  attempt  to  demilitarize  the  government  and  institute  a 
more  democratic  governmental  structure  more  likely  to  help 
improve  relations  with  the  United  States,  Collor  abolished  the 
military-dominated  National  Intelligence  Service  (Servico 
Nacional  de  Informacoes — SNI)  and  the  National  Security 


lxxxvi 


Council  (Conselho  de  Seguranca  Nacional — CSN)  and  formed 
the  civilian-headed  SAE  (Strategic  Affairs  Secretariat). 

However,  the  Collor  government's  policies  soon  reverted  to 
a  more  pragmatic  approach  that  was  more  independent  of  the 
United  States.  Prior  to  Operation  Desert  Storm  against  Iraq  in 
January  1991,  Brazil  found  itself  aiding  the  wrong  side,  with 
controversial  arms  sales,  construction  contracts,  and  transfer  of 
missile  technology  to  Iraq.  Brazil  subsequently  altered  its  close 
commercial  relationship  with  Iraq. 

In  the  second  half  of  the  1990s,  Brazil,  strengthened  by  Mer- 
cosul,  is  evolving  into  a  major  intermediate  regional  power. 
Under  Cardoso,  Brazil  has  sought  a  more  active  international 
role,  both  in  the  UN  and  in  bilateral  relations.  Traditionally, 
Brazil  has  played  a  leading  role  in  collective  security  efforts  and 
economic  cooperation  in  the  Western  Hemisphere.  For  exam- 
ple, in  early  1995  Brazil  negotiated  a  cessation  of  border  fight- 
ing between  Ecuador  and  Peru.  Cardoso  believes  that  Brazil's 
international  influence  will  be  shaped  by  the  extent  to  which 
regional  cooperation  in  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean,  par- 
ticularly the  South  Atlantic,  is  strengthened. 

The  Brazilian  proposal  for  the  creation  of  the  South  Ameri- 
can Free  Trade  Association  (Area  de  Livre  Comercio  Sul-Amer- 
icana — ALCSA,  or  SAFTA),  also  known  as  the  Free  Trade  Area 
of  the  Americas  (FTAA),  by  2005  is  also  an  important  step  in 
Brazil's  efforts  to  promote  regional  integration.  At  a  May  13- 
15,  1997,  meeting  in  Belo  Horizonte  of  the  thirty-four  coun- 
tries participating  in  the  FTAA,  Brazil  opposed  the  United 
States  preference  for  a  faster  timetable  than  2005  and  bilateral 
negotiations  instead  of  discussions  among  trading  blocs,  such 
as  Mercosul  and  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement 
(NAFTA — see  Glossary) . 

Cardoso  also  sees  a  need  for  Brazil  to  develop  alliances,  coa- 
litions, and  partnerships  on  a  global  level,  as  distinct  from  a 
merely  hemispheric  level,  be  it  with  Asia,  Europe,  Africa,  or  the 
Middle  East.  The  Cardoso  government  has  focused  on  develop- 
ing dynamic  trade  partnerships  with  the  European  Union 
(EU — see  Glossary),  Japan,  and  China  as  a  counterweight  to 
United  States  dominance.  Brazilian  exports  to  China  of  agricul- 
tural products  and  byproducts  grew  by  46  percent  in  1995.  In 
dollar  terms,  the  figures  rose  from  US$226.4  million  in  1991  to 
US$1.2  billion  in  1995,  an  increase  of  430  percent. 

In  other  national  security  areas,  the  Brazilian  Armed  Forces 
have  been  seeking  a  new  role  in  the  1990s  in  the  absence  of  any 


lxxxvii 


external  threat  to  national  security.  They  no  longer  have  their 
two  traditional  "enemies":  Argentina  and  communism.  Since 
ending  their  regime  in  March  1985,  the  armed  forces  have  con- 
tinued to  assert  themselves  politically  under  civilian  rule.  Their 
political  influence,  however,  has  diminished  under  the  1988 
constitution,  which  places  them  under  presidential  authority, 
while  the  policy-making  influence  of  the  presidency,  Congress, 
and  civilian  ministries  has  grown.  In  the  absence  of  a  defined 
security  policy  and  a  common  project,  the  armed  forces  have 
been  mired  in  bureaucratic  rivalry. 

Brazil's  defense  budget  in  1997  totaled  US$12  billion.  The 
IBGE  reported  that  investment  in  the  armed  forces  as  a  per- 
centage of  the  government  budget  declined  sharply  from  9.03 
percent  in  1985  to  1.70  percent  in  1995.  Not  only  is  Brazil 
spending  proportionately  little  on  the  military,  some  critics 
have  argued,  but  the  money  is  being  spent  badly  and  is  being 
used  to  maintain  an  archaic  and  top-heavy  bureaucracy.  In  the 
early  1990s,  the  army  proportionately  had  more  generals  (164, 
of  whom  141  were  on  active  duty)  than  the  United  States  Army. 
Critics  have  also  singled  out  as  "wasteful"  the  funds  spent  for 
the  construction  of  a  nuclear  submarine,  scheduled  to  be 
launched  by  2007  at  a  cost  of  US$2.2  billion. 

Brazil's  new  National  Defense  Plan  (Piano  de  Defesa  Nacio- 
nal — PDN),  approved  on  November  7,  1996,  rules  out  "all  pos- 
sibilities" of  conflict  with  Argentina.  The  PDN  states  that  areas 
of  future  possible  conflict  are  linked  with  "drug  trafficking, 
narcoterrorism,  and  the  presence  of  armed  groups  in  Amazon 
regions  bordering  other  countries."  However,  the  "security  and 
development"  school  of  military  thinking  of  a  new  generation 
of  military  strategists  at  the  War  College  (Escola  Superior  de 
Guerra — ESG)  disagrees  with  this  threat  assessment.  It  sees 
poverty  and  inequality  as  the  main  destabilizing  influences. 

The  Clinton  administration  hoped  that  Brazil  would  signifi- 
cantly improve  its  efforts  to  stem  international  drug  smuggling 
across  its  territory  from  Andean  neighbors.  The  Amazon  has 
become  an  international  drug-trafficking  route  in  the  1990s, 
and  Brazil  has  become  a  major  cocaine  exporter.  Increasingly, 
smugglers  have  been  sending  small  shipments  hidden  in  lug- 
gage or  riverboat  cargo.  Under  a  new  cooperation  agreement 
signed  in  April  1995,  the  Clinton  administration  expected  Bra- 
zil to  improve  coordination  with  the  United  States  Drug 
Enforcement  Administration  (DEA).  Stressing  the  threat  posed 
by  drug  trafficking  to  Brazilian  national  security,  President  Car- 


lxxxviii 


doso  announced  on  April  17,  1996,  that  the  armed  forces 
would  join  the  drug  enforcement  effort  in  border  areas,  in  the 
Northeast,  and  in  the  Amazon  region.  Mafia  groups  are  gain- 
ing strength  in  Brazil.  Nearly  fifty  Mafia  kingpins  were  living  in 
Brazil  by  mid-1997,  either  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  or  Sao  Paulo.  Brazil 
had  become  the  Italian  Mafia's  third  area  of  activity,  after  Italy 
itself  and  the  United  States. 

Brazil  is  becoming  the  largest  market  for  money  laundering 
in  the  world,  according  to  the  Federal  Police  (Policia  Federal) 
and  Ministry  of  Justice.  The  Cardoso  government  calculated  in 
1996  that  some  US$490  billion  evade  taxes  every  year  as  a 
result  of  money  laundering.  In  mid-1996  the  government  sub- 
mitted a  bill  to  Congress  containing  measures  to  combat 
money  laundering. 

Within  Brazil,  national  sovereignty  over  the  Amazon  region 
has  been  a  continuing  security  concern  of  the  military,  as  evi- 
denced by  two  projects:  the  Amazon  Region  Surveillance  Sys- 
tem (Sistema  de  Vigilancia  da  Amazonia — Sivam)  and  the 
Amazon  Region  Protection  System  (Sistema  de  Protecao  da 
Amazonia — Sipam).  The  Sipam  and  its  sensor  component, 
Sivam,  involve  superimposing  a  state-of-the-art  surveillance  sys- 
tem that  will,  by  2000,  monitor  5  million  square  kilometers  of 
the  Amazon.  It  will  transmit  digital  data  from  satellites,  fixed 
and  airborne  radars,  and  other  high-tech  sensors  (to  be  built 
under  the  Massachusetts-based  Raytheon  Company's  US$1.4 
billion  contract  with  the  Brazilian  government)  to  computer- 
ized processing  centers  and  hundreds  of  "user-nodes"  dis- 
persed throughout  the  Amazon  region. 

The  concept  of  ecological  security  in  regions  such  as  the 
Amazon  has  become  a  major  national  security  interest  for  Bra- 
zil. In  the  Cardoso  government's  view,  the  Sivam  and  Sipam 
projects  are  examples  of  how  technology  can  be  applied  to  res- 
cue neglected  regions.  Sivam,  which  is  coordinated  by  the  Min- 
istry of  Aeronautics  and  the  SAE  (Strategic  Affairs  Secretariat), 
is  promoted  as  an  environmental  initiative,  with  emphasis  on 
the  protection  of  the  Amazon  region,  such  as  the  monitoring 
of  illegal  logging  and  mining,  forest  burning,  and  even  incur- 
sions into  indigenous  reserves.  The  system  will  be  used  to 
demarcate  boundaries  and  monitor  the  use  of  Indian  reserva- 
tions, national  parks,  and  other  preserves.  In  addition  to  col- 
lecting ecological  data,  Sivam  will  monitor  migration  and 
settlement. 


lxxxix 


However,  Sivam  was  conceived  as  a  military  project  related  to 
the  development  of  an  air  traffic  control  network.  Thus,  Sivam 
will  eliminate  a  radar  blind  spot  for  commercial  airlines  and 
facilitate  the  policing  of  illegal  flights,  estimated  at  as  many  as 
3,000  daily.  These  illegal  flights  involve  the  smuggling  not  only 
of  drugs,  but  also  of  consumer  goods  and  ores.  Most  attention 
is  focused  on  the  722  kilometers  of  the  Brazilian-Colombian 
border,  an  area  where  most  clandestine  flights  by  drug  traffick- 
ers take  place. 

The  Sivam,  which  was  signed  in  May  1995,  was  bogged  down 
in  the  Senate  throughout  1995  and  much  of  1996  amid  objec- 
tions over  the  cost,  United  States  involvement,  and  allegations 
of  influence  peddling  by  a  top  aide  to  President  Cardoso, 
whom  the  president  subsequently  fired.  Ultimately,  thanks  to 
the  personal  intervention  of  President  Cardoso  and  lobbying 
by  the  United  States,  the  Raytheon  Company's  first  financial 
contract  with  the  Brazilian  government  to  build  Sivam  was 
signed  in  October  1996.  Raytheon  signed  Sivam  contracts  with 
two  Brazilian  firms  on  March  14,  1997. 

Despite  its  efforts  to  monitor  the  Amazon  region,  one 
record  set  by  the  Cardoso  administration  has  been  in  destruc- 
tion of  the  Amazon  rain  forest.  Deforestation  in  the  first  three 
years  of  the  Cardoso  administration  reached  60,257  square 
kilometers,  an  area  almost  twice  the  size  of  Belgium.  On  Janu- 
ary 26,  1998,  Brazil's  INPE  (National  Institute  of  Space 
Research),  which  is  headquartered  in  Sao  Jose  dos  Campos, 
released  its  report  on  deforestation  of  the  Legal  Amazon  (the 
nine  states  in  the  North  and  Center-West  regions),  showing  a 
declining  trend  in  1996-97  from  a  record  level  set  in  1995.  The 
new  INPE  figures,  based  on  Landsat  satellite  images,  show  that, 
contrary  to  the  government's  claims  that  deforestation  had 
slowed  during  1992-97,  the  destroyed  area  in  1995  was  29,059 
square  kilometers  of  rain  forest,  the  largest  annual  deforesta- 
tion total  recorded  since  the  satellite  monitoring  began.  The 
1995  figure  represented  more  than  a  doubling  of  the  deforesta- 
tion recorded  in  1994  (14,896  square  kilometers)  and  a  rate 
even  greater  than  that  during  the  1970s.  The  1996  figure  was 
well  below  the  1995  rate,  but  still  a  total  of  18,161  square  kilo- 
meters, an  area  almost  as  large  as  Israel,  disappeared  that  year. 
The  projection  for  1997  is  13,037  square  kilometers  destroyed. 

Another  significant  study,  entitled  The  Use  of  Fire  in  Amazonia: 
Case  Studies  Along  the  Arc  of  Deforestation,  was  released  in  October 
1997  by  the  Woods  Hole  Research  Center  in  Massachussets  and 


xc 


its  newly  established  research  center,  the  Institute  of  Environ- 
mental Research  on  Amazonia  (Instituto  de  Pesquisa  Ambien- 
tal  da  Amazonia — IPAM),  based  at  the  Federal  University  of 
Para  (Universidade  Federal  do  Para — UFPa)  in  Belem.  This 
report  found  that  cutting  and  burning  have  dried  out  the  for- 
est to  the  point  that  it  could  burn  out  of  control. 

On  January  28,  1998,  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  approved  an 
environmental  crimes  bill  to  grant  the  "federal  environmental 
agency"  legal  authority  to  enforce  environmental  protection 
laws.  The  "federal  environmental  agency"  refers  to  the  Brazil- 
ian Institute  for  the  Environment  and  Renewable  Natural 
Resources  (Instituto  Brasileiro  do  Meio-Ambiente  e  dos  Recur- 
sos  Naturais  Renovaveis — Ibama),  which  is  under  the  Environ- 
mental Affairs  Coordinating  Secretariat  (Secretaria  de 
Coordenacao  dos  Assuntos  do  Meio  Ambiente — SMA)  of  the 
Ministry  of  Environment,  Hydraulic  Resources,  and  the  Legal 
Amazon.  The  bill,  which  had  languished  in  Congress  for  seven 
years,  provides  criminal  penalties  for  damaging  the  environ- 
ment and  grants  the  "federal  environmental  agency"  the  right 
to  levy  fines,  prosecute  polluters,  and  order  companies  to  cor- 
rect environmental  hazards. 

Environmentalists  supported  the  legislation,  which  includes 
significant  provisions  requiring  companies  to  pay  the  cost  of 
cleaning  up  environmental  damage  that  they  are  proven  to 
have  caused  (up  to  R$50  million),  prohibiting  proven  polluters 
from  signing  government  contracts,  and  setting  daily  fines  for 
companies  that  refuse  to  clean  up  their  damage.  Although 
President  Cardoso  on  January  30  disputed  the  results  of  the 
INPE's  Brazilian  Amazon  Deforestation  Appraisal  Program 
(Programa  de  Avaliacao  do  Desflorestamento  da  Amazonia 
Brasileira — Prodes),  he  signed  the  new  Environmental  Crimes 
Law  on  February  12.  The  president  vetoed  ten  articles,  includ- 
ing penalties  for  noise  pollution,  traditional  slash-and-burn 
agricultural  burnings,  and  automatic  liability  of  companies  to 
clean  up  their  environmental  damage  and  compensate  victims. 
The  watered-down  law  takes  effect  in  April  1998. 

Since  the  early  1990s,  Brazil  has  actively  sought  to  develop 
nonproliferation  credentials.  In  September  1991,  it  signed  the 
Mendoza  Declaration  prohibiting  chemical  and  biological 
weapons.  On  February  9,  1994,  Brazil  began  addressing  inter- 
national missile  proliferation  concerns  by  establishing  a  civilian 
space  agency,  thus  ensuring  that  Brazil's  space  projects  are 
exclusively  peaceful.  In  addition,  on  May  30,  1994,  Brazil  finally 


xci 


ratified  the  1967  Treaty  for  the  Prohibition  of  Nuclear  Weap- 
ons in  Latin  America  (Treaty  of  Tlatelolco).  Brazil  was  one  of  a 
half-dozen  countries  in  the  world  that  had  not  signed  the  1968 
Non-Proliferation  Treaty  (NPT).  However,  on  June  20,  1997, 
President  Cardoso  submitted  a  request  to  Congress  asking  it  to 
approve  Brazil's  adherence  to  the  NPT 

In  an  attempt  to  overcome  its  reputation  for  transferring 
missile  and  nuclear  technology  to  countries  such  as  Iraq,  Brazil 
signed  the  Missile  Technology  Control  Regime  (MTCR — see 
Glossary)  in  October  1995,  committing  itself  to  abide  by  the 
MTCR  guidelines.  Brazil  hoped  to  convince  MTCR  members — 
such  as  the  United  States,  France,  the  United  Kingdom,  and 
Germany — that  Brazil  can  be  trusted  with  sensitive  technology. 

Brazil's  space  program  since  1991  has  been  restricted  to  cre- 
ating satellite  launchers  for  scientific  and  commercial  pur- 
poses. Unlike  Argentina,  Brazil  was  able  to  join  the  MTCR 
without  having  to  abandon  its  program  for  the  development 
and  construction  of  its  Satellite  Launch  Vehicle  (Vefculo 
Lancador  de  Satelite — VLS).  Production  of  the  VLS  got  under- 
way in  May  1996.  With  MTCR  membership,  Brazil  could  reach 
new  agreements  with  Germany,  for  example,  in  the  field  of 
space  and  nuclear  technology  cooperation  and  produce  and 
export  long-range  rocket  equipment  and  technology.  However, 
Brazil's  fledgling  space  program  suffered  a  setback  on  Novem- 
ber 2,  1997,  when  controllers  were  forced  to  destroy  the  rocket 
that  was  to  carry  the  nation's  second  Data  Gathering  Satellite 
into  Earth's  orbit  to  collect  information  on  the  environment. 

During  then  United  States  Secretary  of  State  Warren  Chris- 
topher's visit  to  Brazil  on  March  1,  1996,  the  Cardoso  govern- 
ment reaffirmed  Brazil's  new  attitude  of  partnership  and 
cooperation  with  the  United  States.  On  that  occasion,  United 
States  and  Brazilian  officials  signed  a  new  bilateral  agreement 
for  cooperation  in  space  that  emphasized  the  use  of  space  tech- 
nology for  environmental  research  and  analysis.  Officials  of 
both  countries  also  pledged  to  cooperate  in  protecting  the 
Amazon  rain  forest.  In  addition,  a  United  States-Brazil  Agree- 
ment for  Cooperation  on  Peaceful  Uses  of  Nuclear  Energy  was 
adopted. 

The  Cardoso  government  articulated  a  strategic  vision  of 
Brazil's  future.  This  vision,  as  explained  by  Ronaldo  Mota 
Sardenberg,  secretary  of  the  SAE,  recognizes  that  the  new 
world  order  is  based  on  knowledge,  communications  technol- 
ogy, and  services;  Brazil  must  insert  itself  into  the  international 


xcii 


community  and  South  America  by  reducing  social  inequalities, 
increasing  national  integration,  and  emphasizing  science  and 
technology.  Thus,  the  Cardoso  government  sees  strategy  as  a 
long-term  socioeconomic  concept  to  overcome  underdevelop- 
ment. It  believes  that  Brazil  will  not  maintain  its  status  as  a  mid- 
dle-income nation,  much  less  climb  into  the  developed  world, 
if  a  large  proportion  of  its  population  is  excluded  and  entire 
regions  of  the  country  continue  to  be  underdeveloped. 

To  better  prepare  Brazil  for  the  strategic  information  needs 
of  the  twenty-first  century,  President  Cardoso  charged  the  SAE 
with  collecting  economic  and  political  information  and  focus- 
ing on  detecting  social  conflicts  that  could  occur  during  his 
presidency.  Cardoso  also  proposed  the  establishment  of  the 
Brazilian  Intelligence  Agency  (Agenda  Brasileira  da  Inteligen- 
cia  Nacional — ABIN),  an  autonomous  organization  also  under 
the  Office  of  the  Presidency.  The  ABIN  is  expected  to  replace 
the  former  SNI  apparatus  in  1998. 

The  new  ministry  of  defense  to  be  established  by  Cardoso  in 
1998  will  merge  the  four  military  ministries.  The  current  mili- 
tary ministries  will  be  reduced  to  commands.  The  commanders 
of  the  army,  air  force,  and  navy  will  be  directly  subordinate  to 
the  minister  of  defense.  The  new  ministry's  budget  for  1998 
totalled  2.9  billion  reals,  almost  US$3  billion,  making  it  the 
third  largest  budget  in  the  government.  Sardenberg  was 
expected  to  become  the  supervisor  of  the  incumbent  military 
ministers,  thereby  undermining  the  decision-making  power  of 
the  military. 

Cardoso  succeeded  in  repairing  Brazil's  international  image 
to  reflect  an  economically  and  politically  stable  and  reliable 
country  that  can  achieve  its  development  potential,  compete 
for  new  markets,  attract  productive  investment,  and  acquire 
foreign  technology.  He  also  appeared  to  have  restored  Brazil- 
ians' self-esteem  and  national  pride.  According  to  the  results  of 
a  Vox  Populi  poll,  reported  in  January  1996,  a  majority  of  peo- 
ple (2,000)  questioned  said  they  believed  Brazil  was  well  on  its 
way  to  becoming  a  great  power.  In  addition,  84  percent 
expressed  pride  in  being  Brazilian,  and  79  percent  said  they 
had  no  wish  to  emigrate. 

Brazil's  160  million  inhabitants  and  rich  resources  make  it  a 
country  of  tremendous  potential.  Realization  of  Brazil's  poten- 
tial, however,  will  depend  on  implementation  of  the  needed 
administrative,  social,  and  tax  reforms.  According  to  a  1997 
study  by  the  University  of  Sao  Paulo,  their  passage  would  result 


XClll 


in  annual  GDP  growth  of  7  percent.  By  late  1997,  little  real 
progress  had  been  made  in  the  areas  of  health,  education, 
homelessness,  land  squatting  by  rural  peasants,  transportation, 
and  so  forth.  Nevertheless,  Cardoso's  Piano  Real  has  aided  the 
poor  more  than  any  other  social  class,  raising  their  standards  of 
living  and  their  spirits  by  giving  them  greater  purchasing  power 
(as  well  as  debts)  and  a  sense  of  upward  mobility.  Although 
Brazil,  with  annual  inflation  of  7.2  percent  in  1997,  is  clearly  on 
a  steadier  course  than  it  was  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  the 
country  still  has  a  long  way  to  go  in  reversing  the  ever-widening 
socioeconomic  inequities  between  rich  and  poor.  Many  regard 
Cardoso  as  the  last,  best  hope  for  Brazil  (at  least  in  this  cen- 
tury) to  take  the  actions  needed  to  get  the  country  to  realize  its 
enormous  potential  and  its  destiny  in  the  twenty-first  century.

In  the  early  months  of  1998,  rampant  drug-trafficking  and 
destruction  of  the  Amazon  rain  forest  rose  to  the  forefront  of 
threats  facing  Brazil.  The  country's  drug  trafficking  and  other 
drug-related  crime  have  expanded  much  more  rapidly  and 
insidiously  than  the  capability  of  Brazilian  society  to  perceive 
the  threat.  Three  laws  enacted  in  late  February  1998  demon- 
strate the  higher  priority  to  be  accorded  by  the  Cardoso  gov- 
ernment to  drug  enforcement.  First,  President  Cardoso 
ordered  the  creation  of  the  Special  Secretariat  for  National 
Drug-Control  Policy  (Secretaria  Especial  da  Politica  Nacional 
do  Controle  de  Drogas — SEPNCD),  directly  subordinate  to  the 
presidency  of  the  republic.  The  SEPNCD  will  give  priority  to 
border  surveillance  and  control  and  coordinate  the  activities  of 
state  and  local  security  agencies  with  fourteen  federal  agencies 
that  combat  drugs.  It  will  also  develop  strategies  and  national 
policy  on  drug  control.  Second,  Cardoso  signed  a  newly  passed 
money-laundering  law,  which  will  create  mechanisms  to  iden- 
tify "dirty  money"  and  set  prison  terms  of  three  to  five  years  for 
money  laundering.  And  third,  Cardoso  signed  a  law  authoriz- 
ing government  agencies  to  shoot  down  hostile  aircraft. 

In  the  second  half  of  March  1998,  fires  brought  on  by  the 
worst  drought  in  memory  and  queimadas  (burnings)  by  slash- 
and-burn  farmers  swept  Roraima,  destroying  vast  swaths  of 


xciv 


savanna  and  the  rain  forests  that  were  home  to  the  Yanomami 
Indians.  Roraima  is  the  state  with  the  lowest  population  density 
in  Brazil  (one  inhabitant  per  square  kilometer),  but  it  has  the 
largest  indigenous  community  in  the  country,  with  about  14 
percent  of  the  nation's  native  American  population.  The  con- 
flagration was  the  worst  in  the  history  of  the  Amazon  Region, 
according  to  the  National  Institute  of  Amazon  Region 
Research  (Instituto  Nacional  de  Pesquisas  da  Amazonia — 
INPA).  Indeed,  in  the  assessment  of  the  United  Nations  (UN) 
representative  in  Brazil,  Walter  Franco,  the  fires  constituted  an 
environmental  disaster  unprecedented  on  the  planet.  They 
consumed  more  than  36  million  hectares,  or  33,000  square 
kilometers,  an  area  larger  than  Belgium  and  constituting  15 
percent  of  Roraima's  territory.  Although  the  Brazilian  military 
rejected  a  UN  offer  to  help  combat  the  fire  as  an  intrusion  into 
Brazil's  sovereignty,  the  Cardoso  government  accepted  it.

In  the  largest  conservation  step  ever  in  the  Amazon,  on  April 
29,  1998,  President  Cardoso  committed  Brazil  to  tripling  the 
area  of  Amazon  forests  under  formal  government  protection 
by  2000.  The  agreement,  to  be  carried  out  with  the  financial 
and  technical  assistance  of  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary)  and 
the  World  Wildlife  Fund,  would  turn  10  percent  of  the  Brazil- 
ian Amazon,  or  25  million  hectares,  into  parks  and  preserves.

EXPORTS,  SLAVERY,  AND  PATRIARCHY  have  been  the  three 
constants  of  Brazilian  history.  The  export  orientation  of  the 
colonial  economy  shaped  Brazil's  society.  Even  the  name  "Bra- 
zil," like  the  country  itself,  is  suggestive  of  commerce  and  the 
pursuit  of  wealth.  Brazil's  name  derives  from  the  brazilwood 
trees  from  which  Europeans  sought  in  the  sixteenth  century  to 
make  valuable  red  dyes.  However,  the  central  fact  of  the  coun- 
try's history  was  the  exploitation  of  cheap  labor,  first  as  slaves, 
then  as  wage-earners.  Indeed,  Brazil's  history  is  the  story  not 
only  of  conquest  but  also  of  the  enslavement  of  its  native  peo- 
ples and  of  millions  of  imported  African  slaves. 

Brazil's  history  can  be  divided  into  five  economic  periods, 
each  characterized  by  a  dominant  export  product.  The  first 
period,  from  1500  to  1550,  involved  the  logging  of  brazilwood 
along  the  coast  of  the  Northeast  (Nordeste).  Brazilwood  was 
the  source  of  a  red  dye  important  to  the  expanding  textile 
industry  of  sixteenth-century  northern  Europe,  particularly 
Normandy  and  Flanders.  The  trees  and  the  ready  labor  of  the 
natives,  who  were  eager  to  acquire  metal  products  in  return  for 
cutting  and  hauling  logs  to  the  coast,  attracted  Portuguese  and 
French  ships.  The  French  were  quite  successful  because  they 
sent  young  men  to  reside  among  the  natives,  to  learn  their  lan- 
guages, and  to  get  them  to  bring  the  timber  to  the  nearest  bay 
or  estuary.  By  contrast,  the  Portuguese,  in  the  first  few  decades, 
traded  from  their  ships  or  haphazard  outposts.  The  Portuguese 
attempted  to  use  the  factory  system  that  they  were  then 
employing  along  the  African,  South  Asian,  and  Asian  coasts. 
This  system  consisted  of  fortified  trading  posts  that  had  mini- 
mal contact  with  the  local  population.  The  French,  with  deeper 
roots  among  the  native  peoples  and  more  knowledge  of  their 
cultures,  filled  their  waiting  ships  more  quickly.  France's  activ- 
ity convinced  the  Portuguese  crown  to  undertake  sustained  set- 
tlement to  protect  its  claim. 

The  Europeans  struggled  among  themselves  for  control  of 
the  beachheads,  anchorages,  and  bays.  The  Portuguese  effort 
to  gain  effective  control  of  the  coast  coincided  with  the  onset 
of  the  sugar  era,  which  extended  from  1530  to  1650.  Sugarcane 
cultivation  was  carried  out  in  widely  separated  tidewater 
enclaves  from  Sao  Vicente  in  the  South  (Sul — the  present-day 
states  of  Parana,  Santa  Catarina,  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul)  to

Pernambuco  in  the  Northeast;  it  became  most  successful 
around  the  Bahian  Reconcavo  and  in  Pernambuco.  Enslaved 
natives  and  increasingly,  after  the  1560s,  imported  African 
slaves  provided  the  labor  for  the  mills  (engenhos)  and  fields. 

Sugar  tied  Brazil  into  the  developing  system  of  European 
capitalism,  imposed  a  patriarchal  social  system  on  the  country, 
and  prompted  Dutch  attacks  on  Portugal's  South  Atlantic 
empire.  The  sugar  economy's  need  for  oxen  and  meat  led  to 
the  accompanying  growth  of  cattle  raising  in  the  dry  interior 
hinterlands,  known  as  the  sertdo.  Cattle  raising  became  so 
important  to  the  economy  and  to  the  development  of  the  inte- 
rior as  to  almost  constitute  a  phase  in  its  own  right.  However, 
although  cattle  raising  provided  hides  for  export,  it  supplied 
principally  local  markets.  The  Dutch  seizure  of  Recife  in  1630 
and  their  subsequent  capture  of  Luanda  on  the  Angolan  coast, 
a  principal  source  of  slaves  imported  into  Brazil,  disrupted  the 
Portuguese  dominance  over  sugar.  When  the  Hollanders 
(holandeses)  withdrew  from  Brazil  in  1654,  they  stimulated  cane 
growing  on  the  Caribbean  islands  and  used  their  control  of  dis- 
tribution in  Europe  to  reduce  Portuguese  access. 

The  third  period — mining  of  gold  and  diamonds  from  the 
1690s  to  the  1750s — carried  Portugal's  effective  occupation  of 
the  land  far  into  the  interior  of  what  are  now  the  states  of 
Minas  Gerais,  Goias,  and  Mato  Grosso.  The  discoveries  of  allu- 
vial gold  on  the  Rio  das  Velhas  in  about  1693,  throughout  cen- 
tral Minas  Gerais  in  the  next  years,  and  out  into  Mato  Grosso  in 
1718  and  Goias  in  1725,  and  then  the  growth  of  diamond  min- 
ing along  the  Rio  Jequitinhonha  in  Minas  Gerais  after  1730, 
shifted  the  colonial  center  away  from  the  Northeast  coast  into 
the  interior.  Minas  Gerais  became  the  new  jewel  in  Portugal's 
crown,  although  one  that  was  difficult  to  keep  in  place.  As 
more  people  spread  to  the  distant  interior,  many  of  them  were 
living  beyond  the  reach  of  royal  officials.  Indeed,  one  of  Bra- 
zil's distinctive  features  has  always  been  the  existence  of  people 
who  live  within  the  boundaries  of  the  country  but  outside  the 
limits  of  the  society  and  the  controls  of  the  state. 

The  Northeast  and  the  South  were  tied  to  Minas  Gerais  via 
the  livestock  trade.  The  mineiro  (Minas  Gerais)  towns  needed 
beef,  as  well  as  a  seemingly  endless  supply  of  mules.  Without 
good  roads,  mule  trains  became  characteristic  of  the  region, 
which  was  soon  tied  together  by  an  extensive  web  of  trails.  The 
cattle  came  south  from  ranches  along  the  Rio  Sao  Francisco, 
thereby  linking  the  mines  to  the  Northeast.  The  mules  came 


4 


Historical  Setting 


from  the  pampas  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  via  the  market  at  Soro- 
caba  in  Sao  Paulo,  tying  the  South  to  the  mining  region. 
Because  Paulistas  (residents  of  the  state  of  Sao  Paulo)  made 
most  of  the  initial  gold  strikes,  Sao  Paulo  was  connected  to  all 
the  mining  areas.  The  importance  of  Minas  Gerais  and  the 
mines  farther  inland  led  the  crown  to  transfer  the  viceregal 
capital  from  Salvador,  Bahia,  to  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1763. 

Gold  production  declined  in  the  later  decades  of  the  eigh- 
teenth century,  and  from  about  1820  coffee  cultivation  pro- 
vided a  fourth  period  that  lasted  to  the  end  of  the  1920s.  It 
began  in  the  mountains  behind  Rio  de  Janeiro,  moved  along 
the  Rio  Paraiba  Valley  to  the  west  across  Sao  Paulo  State  and 
out  into  Parana.  Coffee  powered  the  rise  of  Sao  Paulo  and  its 
port  of  Santos,  and  although  it  gradually  took  a  secondary  posi- 
tion to  industrialization  after  the  late  1930s,  Brazil  remained 
the  world's  major  coffee  producer. 

The  Amazon  had  an  important  era  of  its  own  from  the  1880s 
to  1919,  when  it  was  the  world's  major  source  of  rubber.  The 
rubber  boom  drew  world  attention  to  the  region,  prompted 
Brazil  to  secure  its  boundaries,  and  lured  thousands  of  rubber 
tappers  from  the  drought-plagued  sertdo  of  the  Northeast  to  the 
forests  of  Acre.  It  turned  into  a  bust  when  the  helter-skelter  col- 
lection of  wild  rubber  lost  out  to  the  massive  production  meth- 
ods of  British,  Dutch,  and  French  plantations  in  Southeast  Asia. 

The  fifth  period  began  in  the  1930s  with  import-substitution 
industrialization  (see  Glossary)  and  extended  into  the  1990s. 
Industry's  initial  and  heaviest  concentration  was  in  the  triangle 
of  Sao  Paulo-Rio  de  Janeiro-Belo  Horizonte.  The  period  was 
perhaps  best  symbolized  by  the  steel  mills  of  Volta  Redonda, 
built  in  1944,  and  Sao  Paulo's  integrated  industrial  zone.  Indus- 
trialization and  its  parallel  urbanization  attracted  rural 
migrants  from  throughout  the  country,  but  especially  from  the 
drought-plagued  Northeast.  In  the  space  of  a  generation  after 
1940,  Brazil  leaped  from  the  age  of  the  bull-cart  to  that  of  the 
internal  combustion  engine,  changing  the  national  map  in  the 
process. 

Before  the  1930s,  despite  the  earlier  incursions  into  the  inte- 
rior, Brazil  still  consisted  of  a  series  of  enclaves  connected  by 
sealanes  rather  than  by  railroads  or  paved  highways.  Pan  Amer- 
ican Airway's  introduction  of  the  DC-3  on  its  run  from  Belem 
to  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1940  vaulted  Brazil  directly  into  the  air 
age.  By  the  1970s,  it  had  the  world's  third  largest  commercial 
air  fleet  after  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union.  The

1950s  push  to  develop  an  automotive  industry  was  followed  in 
later  decades  by  large-scale  construction  of  long-distance  high- 
ways, which  by  the  1980s  made  it  possible  to  travel  to  all  regions 
of  the  country  on  paved  roads.  Symbolic  of  this  era  was  the 
building  of  Brazil's  third  capital  at  Brasilia  (1955-60)  on  the 
plains  of  Goias.  The  internal  combustion  engine  and  the  coin- 
ciding growth  of  the  petroleum  industry  also  made  possible  the 
mechanization  of  agriculture,  which  changed  rapidly  the  face 
of  the  Brazilian  west  and  made  Brazil  the  second  largest 
exporter  of  food  in  the  1980s.  The  combination  of  highways 
and  automotive  transport  opened  up  Amazonia  for  the  first 
time.  The  construction  of  the  highway  corridors  from  Brasilia 
to  Belem  and  from  Cuiaba  to  Porto  Velho  to  Manaus  triggered 
large-scale  migration,  mining  and  agricultural  development, 
timbering,  land  disputes,  displacement  of  native  peoples,  and 
massive  deforestation.  The  latter  made  Brazil's  Amazon  policies 
the  subject  of  world  debate,  which  in  turn  made  Brazilians 
worry  about  the  security  of  their  immense  North  region 
(Amazonia). 

The  Indigenous  Population 

In  1500  Pedro  Alvares  Cabral's  fleet,  which  was  en  route  to 
India,  landed  at  Porto  Seguro  in  what  is  now  the  state  of  Bahia. 
The  territory  that  comprises  modern  Brazil  had  a  native  popu- 
lation in  the  millions,  divided  among  hundreds  of  tribes  and 
language  groups.  Their  ancestors  had  lived  in  this  land  for  as 
long  as  30,000  years.  There  is  no  way  to  be  certain  of  the  exact 
size  of  the  population  or  its  distribution.  Many  areas  that  were 
inhabited  in  1500  were  later  stripped  bare  by  epidemics  or 
slave  hunters.  But  scholars  have  attempted  to  make  estimates 
based  on  contemporary  reports  and  the  supposed  carrying 
capacity  of  the  land.  For  Brazil's  Amazon  Basin  alone,  demog- 
rapher William  M.  Denevan  has  suggested  3,625,000  people, 
with  another  4,800,000  in  other  regions.  Other  estimates  place 
5  million  inhabitants  in  Amazonia  alone.  More  conservatively, 
British  historian  John  Hemming  estimated  2,431,000  people 
for  Brazil  as  a  whole.  These  figures  are  based  on  known  tribes, 
although  many  unknown  ones  probably  died  out  in  the  devas- 
tating epidemics  of  the  colonial  era. 

Certainly,  the  indigenous  population  exceeded  that  of  Por- 
tugal itself.  The  early  European  chroniclers  wrote  of  multi- 
tudes along  the  coast  and  of  dense  populations  in  the  Amazon 
Basin.  Far  from  being  awed  by  the  newcomers,  the  indigenous

inhabitants  displayed  curiosity  and  hospitality,  a  willingness  to 
exchange  goods,  and  a  distinct  ability  at  aggressive  defense. 
However,  they  could  not  prevent  the  devastation  caused  by  the 
diseases  carried  by  the  Europeans  and  Africans.  Tens  of  thou- 
sands succumbed  to  smallpox,  measles,  tuberculosis,  typhoid, 
dysentery,  and  influenza.  Whole  peoples  were  likely  annihi- 
lated without  having  had  direct  contact  with  Europeans  as  dis- 
ease was  carried  along  the  indigenous  trade  routes. 

The  Indians  spoke  languages  that  scholars  have  classified 
into  four  families:  the  Ge  speakers,  originally  spread  along  the 
coast  and  into  the  central  plateau  and  scrub  lands;  the  Tupi 
speakers,  who  displaced  the  Ge  on  the  coast  and  hence  were 
the  first  met  by  the  Portuguese;  the  Carib  speakers  in  the  north 
and  in  Amazonia,  who  were  related  distantly  to  the  people  who 
gave  their  name  to  the  Caribbean;  the  Arawak  (or  Aruak) 
speakers  in  Amazonia,  whose  linguistic  relatives  ranged  up 
through  Central  America  to  Florida;  and,  according  to  sociolo- 
gist Donald  Sawyer,  the  Nambicuara  in  northwestern  Mato 
Grosso  (see  Language,  ch.  2).  These  were  not  tribes  but  lan- 
guage families  that  comprised  many  language  groups.  Numer- 
ous tribes  also  spoke  languages  unrelated  to  any  of  the  above. 
Warfare  and  migrations  carried  peoples  from  these  linguistic 
families  to  various  parts  of  Brazil.  The  Europeans  took  advan- 
tage of  the  cultural  differences  among  the  Indian  peoples  to 
pit  one  against  the  other  and  to  form  alliances  that  provided 
auxiliary  troops  in  their  colonial  wars. 

Portugal  viewed  the  Indians  as  slave  labor  from  the  outset. 
When  Portugal  began  its  imperial  ventures,  it  had  a  population 
of  about  1  million.  Indeed,  in  the  mid-sixteenth  century  Portu- 
gal's population  was  so  sparse  that  much  of  its  territory  was 
uncultivated  and  abandoned.  African  and  native  Brazilian 
slaves  were  common  on  the  streets  of  Lisbon.  Portugal's  colo- 
nial economy  in  Brazil  was  based  on  slavery.  Initially,  the  Portu- 
guese bartered  with  the  natives  to  bring  brazilwood  and  other 
forest  items  to  the  coast.  However,  when  the  natives  had  accu- 
mulated all  the  tools  and  pots  that  they  needed,  they  showed  a 
lack  of  interest  in  continuing  the  arrangement.  Consequently, 
the  Portuguese  turned  to  violent  persuasion.  The  enslavement 
of  the  natives  shaped  much  of  the  history  that  followed. 

Just  as  Indian  unrest  had  aided  the  Spanish  conquerors  of 
Mexico  and  Peru,  so  too  did  the  Portuguese  profit  from  arriv- 
ing at  a  time  of  turmoil.  The  Tupi  speakers  had  been  shifting 
steadily  from  the  south  in  a  massive  migration  to  coastal  areas, 


7

displacing  the  resident  Ge  speakers,  many  of  whom  moved  into 
the  interior.  This  population  shift  had  triggered  continuous 
warfare  against  non-Tupi  peoples  and  against  Tupi  subsets.  It 
involved  set  battles  that  arrayed  hundreds  and,  in  some 
reports,  thousands  of  warriors  in  fierce  hand-to-hand  combat. 
Some  of  the  fighting  went  beyond  struggles  over  control  of 
land  or  resources  to  vendettas  in  which  captives  were  sought 
and  in  some  cases  reportedly  cannibalized.  The  Portuguese 
used  these  vendettas  to  keep  the  Indians  from  uniting  against 
them  and  subsequently  to  obtain  slaves.  The  conquest  of  Brazil 
was  not  a  simple  toppling  of  an  organized  empire  as  in  Peru, 
but  a  drawn  out,  complicated  process  that  spread  over  huge 
distances,  different  peoples,  and  centuries.  Thus,  it  is  not  sur- 
prising that  the  Brazilian  elites  developed  myths  about  racial 
harmony,  peaceful  change,  and  compromise  that  often  have 
colored  the  interpretations  of  historians,  thereby  distorting 
understanding  of  Brazil's  past. 

Just  as  Portugal  was  different  from  the  rest  of  Europe,  so  too 
would  Brazil  be  different  from  the  rest  of  the  Americas.  Portu- 
gal was  both  an  agrarian  and  a  maritime  monarchy  that  used  its 
control  over  land  grants  to  discipline  the  nobility  and  its  issu- 
ance of  trading  licenses  to  attract  local  and  foreign  investment 
in  its  overseas  ventures.  As  merchant-king,  the  monarch  super- 
vised an  economic  system  that  imported  timber,  sugar,  and 
wine  from  Madeira  and  the  Azores,  gold  from  the  Guinea 
coast,  spices  from  India,  and  dyewood  and  forest  products, 
then  sugar,  gold,  gems,  and  hides  from  Brazil.  These  products 
were  then  reexported  to  Europe. 

The  Portuguese  established  themselves  on  the  Brazilian 
coast  in  their  drive  to  control  Europe's  trade  with  India  and 
East  Asia.  They  secured  "title"  to  what  became  eastern  Brazil  in 
their  attempted  division  of  the  world  with  Spain  in  the  Treaty 
of  Tordesillas  (see  Glossary)  of  1494.  During  the  next  centu- 
ries, the  Portuguese,  Spanish,  French,  English,  and  Dutch 
changed  the  South  American  continent's  trade  patterns,  which 
previously  had  been  focused  internally.  Seeking  profits,  the 
Portuguese  marshaled  Indian  labor  to  provide  exportable 
products.  The  commercial  objective  that  initially  had 
prompted  overseas  operations  became  the  first  principle  of 
Portuguese  colonization.  Brazil  was  not  to  be  a  place  where 
Europe's  religious  dissidents  sought  freedom  of  conscience. 
Rather,  to  paraphrase  historian  Caio  Prado  Junior,  the  coloni- 
zation of  tropical  Brazil  would  be  "one  vast  commercial  enter-

prise."  Colonial  Brazil's  reason  for  being  was  to  supply 
dyewood,  sugar,  tobacco,  eventually  gold  and  diamonds,  cot- 
ton, coffee,  and  later  rubber  for  the  European  and  then  world 
markets.  The  externally  oriented  colonial  economy  consisted 
of  enclaves  that  faced  seaward  and  that  considered  only  their 
own  commercial  interests. 

In  his  1843  essay,  "How  the  History  of  Brazil  Should  Be  Writ- 
ten," Karl  Friederich  Philipp  von  Martius  urged  the  study  of 
the  three  basic  racial  groups — indigenous  peoples,  Europeans, 
and  Africans — to  obtain  a  clear  understanding  of  the  country's 
history.  Yet  when  he  discussed  the  interactions  between  the 
Indians  and  the  Portuguese,  he  wrote  that  the  former  were 
only  a  few  primitive  tribes  and  that  the  "colonies  developed 
and  expanded  almost  without  caring  about  these  Indians." 
Although  he  could  not  have  been  more  wrong,  historians  have 
echoed  his  attitude  repeatedly.  The  natives,  rather  than  being 
few,  were  in  the  millions,  and  the  Portuguese  determination  to 
exploit  their  labor  shaped  frontier  expansion  and  set  Brazil's 
modern  boundaries. 

The  Colonial  Era,  1500-1815 

Frontier  Expansion  That  Shaped  Brazil 

Under  the  Treaty  of  Tordesillas,  everything  to  the  east  of  the 
line  that  ran  from  pole  to  pole  370  leagues  west  of  the  Cape 
Verde  Islands  was  to  be  Portugal's  to  exploit.  The  exact  reason 
for  Portugal's  interest  in  having  the  line  so  far  to  the  west  is 
debatable,  but  the  Portuguese  may  have  been  trying  to  keep 
the  Castilians  away  from  the  sure  route  to  the  East.  Very  practi- 
cally, the  line's  placement  gave  Portuguese  vessels  en  route  to 
India  ample  room  to  pick  up  winds  and  currents  that  took 
them  around  the  southern  end  of  Africa,  a  feat  carried  out  by 
Vasco  da  Gama  on  his  voyage  of  1497-99.  The  Portuguese  also 
may  have  known  that  western  lands  or  islands  lay  on  their  side 
of  the  line.  On  the  modern  map  of  Brazil,  in  the  north  the  line 
cuts  across  the  eastern  end  of  the  Ilha  de  Marajo,  and  in  the 
south  it  passes  through  Laguna  on  the  coast  of  Santa  Catarina. 
Because  most  of  present-day  Brazil  lies  to  the  west  of  the  line, 
clearly  the  Portuguese  expanded  successfully  on  this  initial  divi- 
sion. 

The  territorial  aggrandizement,  which  is  one  of  the  main 
themes  of  Brazilian  history,  was  both  accidental  and  a  matter  of 
state  policy.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  detailed  geography  of  South

America  persisted  into  the  twentieth  century,  so  it  is 
understandable  that  Portuguese  officials  professed  to  believe 
into  the  eighteenth  century  that  the  estuaries  of  both  the 
Amazon  and  the  Rio  de  la  Plata  were  on  their  side  of  the 
Tordesillas  Line.  The  two  river  systems  were,  in  the  words  of 
the  Jesuit  Father  Simao  de  Vasconcellos,  "two  keys  that  lock  the 
land  of  Brazil  .  .  .  two  giants  that  defend  it  and  demarcate 
between  us  [Portuguese]  and  Castille."  Several  centuries  of 
penetration  along  these  river  systems  gave  Brazil  its  distinctive 
shape.  It  could  be  said  that  today's  Brazil  owes  its  vast  territory 
to  the  native  Indians  who  served  as  skilled  trackers,  warriors, 
porters,  food  suppliers,  and  paddlers  for  the  Portuguese 
expeditions,  and  to  the  Indians  whose  potential  as  slaves  lured 
the  Portuguese  inland. 

The  Portuguese  empire  at  the  outset  was  a  commercial 
rather  than  a  colonial  one.  Portugal  lacked  sufficient  popula- 
tion to  establish  colonies  of  settlers  throughout  its  maritime 
empire.  The  Portuguese  practice  was  to  conquer  enough  space 
for  a  trading  fort  and  a  surrounding  enclave  from  which  to 
draw  on  the  wealth  and  resources  of  the  adjacent  country.  A 
map  of  this  maritime  commercial  domain  would  show  a  series 
of  dots  connected  by  sealanes  rather  than  continuous  stretches 
of  territory.  French  competition  forced  the  Portuguese  shift  to 
colonialism  in  Brazil.  This  shift  involved  the  gradual  move 
from  trading  for  brazilwood  to  cultivating  sugarcane,  which 
required  control  of  great  expanses  of  land  and  increasing  num- 
bers of  slaves.  The  first  to  burst  past  the  Tordesillas  Line  were 
the  slave  hunters.  The  shift  to  colonialism  was  also  facilitated 
by  the  union  of  the  Spanish  and  Portuguese  crowns  between 
1580  and  1640.  Although  the  two  governments  on  the  Iberian 
Peninsula  and  in  the  Americas  were  kept  separate,  trade  and 
travel  controls  became  lax.  An  active  contraband  trade  devel- 
oped between  Brazilian  settlements  and  Buenos  Aires,  and  Por- 
tuguese moving  overland  appeared  in  Asuncion,  Potosf,  Lima, 
and  even  Quito. 

Expansion  along  the  Atlantic  coast  had  been  gradual.  Using 
the  model  of  the  Atlantic  islands,  the  crown  in  1536  divided  the 
Brazilian  coast  into  fifteen  donatory  captaincies  (donatdrios) . 
To  induce  settlement,  the  crown  offered  ten  leagues  of  coast- 
line as  personal  property,  a  percentage  of  the  dyewood  trade, 
control  over  trade  of  enslaved  natives,  as  well  as  the  exclusive 
right  to  build  mills.  In  1580  Brazil  comprised  the  area  from 
Pernambuco  in  the  north  to  Sao  Vicente  in  the  south.  With

Spanish  assistance  thereafter,  the  Portuguese  expanded  north 
to  Paraiba,  then  west  through  Ceara  and  Maranhao  against  the 
natives  and  the  French,  until  they  founded  Belem  in  1616. 
Beginning  in  1621,  these  possessions  were  divided  into  the 
state  of  Maranhao  (embracing  the  crown  captaincies  of  Ceara, 
Maranhao,  and  Para)  and  the  state  of  Brazil,  centering  on  Sal- 
vador, Bahia.  The  reassertion  of  Portuguese  independence 
under  the  Bragancas  in  1640  led  to  sporadic  conflict  in  frontier 
areas  and  to  policies  seeking  to  hold  back  Spanish  advances.  In 
the  Amazon  and  Rio  de  la  Plata  river  basins,  the  Spanish  rather 
than  the  Portuguese  had  been  first  on  the  scene.  The  Span- 
iards included  Alvar  Nunez  Cabeza  de  Vaca,  who  journeyed 
from  the  coast  of  Santa  Catarina  to  Asuncion  in  1540,  and 
Francisco  de  Orellana,  who  descended  the  Amazon  in  1542. 

The  most  important  Spanish  advances  were  the  mission  set- 
tlements, where  the  Jesuits  Christianized  native  peoples.  Two 
areas  of  particular  importance  lay  adjacent  to  the  river  systems 
that  delimit  Brazil  in  the  south  and  in  the  north:  the  Parana- 
Paraguay  Basin  in  the  south  and  the  Mamore-Guapore  Basin  in 
the  north.  From  1609  to  1628,  the  Jesuits  founded  eight  mis- 
sions among  the  Guarani  peoples  between  the  Parana  and 


11

Paraguai  rivers  in  what  is  now  southern  Paraguay.  They  pressed 
deep  into  what  is  today  the  state  of  Parana,  between  the  Ivai 
and  Paranapanema  rivers,  to  establish  fifteen  more  in  what  was 
called  Guaira  Province. 

From  1629  to  1631,  the  Guaira  missions  were  attacked  by 
slave  hunters,  known  as  bandeirantes  (see  Glossary),  from  the 
Portuguese  town  of  Sao  Paulo.  According  to  the  governor  of 
Buenos  Aires,  these  attacks  resulted  in  the  enslavement  of 
more  than  70,000  Guaranf.  Consequently,  the  Jesuits  decided 
to  evacuate  some  10,000  survivors  downriver  and  overland  to 
sites  between  the  Rio  Uruguai  and  the  Atlantic,  in  what  became 
the  state  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul.  Other  Jesuits  fleeing  the  Guaira 
missions  set  up  missions  among  the  Itatfn  people  on  the  east- 
ern bank  of  the  Rio  Paraguai  in  what  is  now  Mato  Grosso  do 
Sul,  only  to  be  destroyed  brutally  by  bandeirantes  in  the  1630s 
and  1640s.  By  1650  only  twenty-two  of  forty-eight  missions 
remained  in  the  whole  region.  The  Jesuits  stopped  the  slave 
hunters  in  the  south  by  arming  and  training  the  Guaranf,  who 
dealt  a  significant  blow  to  their  oppressors  in  the  Battle  of  Mbo- 
rore  in  1641.  This  victory  ensured  the  continued  existence  of 
the  southern  Spanish  missions  for  another  century,  although 
they  became  a  focal  point  of  Portuguese-Spanish  conflict  in  the 
1750s.  Broadly  speaking,  the  Battle  of  Mborore  stabilized  the 
general  boundary  lines  between  the  Portuguese  and  the  Span- 
ish in  the  south. 

In  the  north,  the  Spanish  had  established  the  town  of  Santa 
Cruz  de  la  Sierra  in  1561  and  from  there  planted  missions  in 
the  Mamore-Guapore  Basin  in  about  1682.  Called  the  Mojos 
and  Chiquitos,  these  mission  provinces  were  in  what  is  now  low- 
land Bolivia  fronting  on  the  states  of  Mato  Grosso  and 
Rondonia.  By  1746  there  were  twenty-four  mission  towns  in  the 
Mojos  and  ten  in  Chiquitos.  The  bandeirantes  again  carried  the 
flag  of  Portugal  into  the  region,  first  attacking  the  Chiquitos 
missions  for  slaves  and  then  discovering  gold  in  Mato  Grosso 
(1718-36).  Unsure  where  these  gold  discoveries  were  in  rela- 
tion to  the  Spanish  territories,  the  members  of  the  Lisbon- 
based  Overseas  Council,  which  administered  the  colonies, 
ordered  a  comprehensive  reconnaissance  and  the  drawing  of 
accurate  maps.  In  1723  Francisco  de  Melo  Palheta  led  an  expe- 
dition from  Belem  to  the  Guapore,  reporting  to  Lisbon  the 
startling  news  about  the  numerous  prosperous  Jesuit  missions. 
Moreover,  the  question  of  fixing  borders  had  become  more 
urgent  in  1722,  when  a  respected  French  cartographer  placed 


12 


Historical  Setting 


the  mouths  of  the  Amazon  and  the  Rfo  de  la  Plata  on  the  Span- 
ish side  of  the  Tordesillas  Line. 

Because  the  Guapore  rises  in  Mato  Grosso  and  flows  into  the 
Mamore,  which  enters  the  Madeira,  and  then  into  the  Amazon, 
these  rivers  formed  a  natural  border.  Moreover,  the  headwaters 
of  the  Paraguai  were  close  and  offered  the  possibility  of  linking 
the  Amazonian  and  La  Plata  systems.  In  1748  Lisbon  created 
the  Captaincy  of  Mato  Grosso  as  its  rampart  on  the  Peruvian 
side  and  later  in  the  century  erected  Fort  Principe  de  Beira  on 
the  Guapore.  In  northern  Amazonia,  in  what  were  then  the 
royal  states  of  Maranhao  and  Para,  the  Portuguese,  worried 
about  Dutch  traders  from  Guiana  (modern  Suriname)  and 
Spaniards  from  Venezuela,  built  fortifications  at  Obidos, 
Manaus,  Tabatinga,  and  on  the  Rio  Branco  and  Rio  Negro  dur- 
ing the  eighteenth  century,  thereby  solidifying  their  claims.  As 
it  turned  out,  it  was  easier  to  secure  the  vast  North  region  than 
it  was  the  South. 

In  1680  the  Portuguese  had  built  a  fort  at  Colonia  do  Sacra- 
mento on  the  eastern  La  Plata  shore  opposite  Buenos  Aires  to 
guard  their  claim  and  to  capture  a  share  of  the  contraband 
trade  with  silver-rich  Potosf.  According  to  the  Overseas  Coun- 
cil, Lisbon  adopted  the  policy  of  fortifying  and  settling  the 
coast  below  Santa  Catarina,  because  "the  continuation  of  these 
settlements  will  be  the  best  means  of  deciding  the  question  of 
limits  .  .  .  between  the  two  crowns.!' 

By  the  mid-eighteenth  century,  the  Iberian  powers  were 
ready  to  admit  the  fiction  of  Tordesillas  and  to  redraw  their 
lines  in  South  America  on  the  basis  of  uti  possidetis  (that  is,  own- 
ership by  occupation  rather  than  by  claim).  The  Portuguese 
gave  up  Colonia  do  Sacramento,  and  in  return  received  the 
lands  of  the  Jesuit  order's  seven  missions  in  western  Rio 
Grande.  This  exchange  led  to  the  Guaranf  War  of  1756,  which 
destroyed  the  missions  and  contributed  to  the  Jesuit  expulsion 
from  Portuguese  (1759)  and  Spanish  (1763)  possessions.  With 
the  Treaties  of  1750,  1761,  and  1777,  Brazil  took  on  its  modern 
shape.  The  lines  were  drawn  for  the  nineteenth-century  strug- 
gles over  the  East  Bank  (Banda  Oriental,  or  present-day  Uru- 
guay) of  the  Rio  Uruguai  and  the  Rfo  de  la  Plata,  the  war  with 
the  United  Provinces  of  the  Rfo  de  la  Plata  (1825-28),  and  the 
Paraguayan  War,  also  known  as  the  War  of  the  Triple  Alliance 
(1864-70). 

Thus,  as  a  result  of  slave  hunting,  gold  prospecting,  and  Por- 
tuguese royal  policy,  the  Tordesillas  Line  became  obsolete,  and

Portugal  obtained  more  than  half  of  South  America.  When 
Brazil  became  independent  in  1822,  its  huge  territory  was  com- 
parable in  size  with  the  Russian  and  Chinese  empires. 

Early  Colonization 

On  April  22,  1500,  the  thirteen-ship  fleet  under  Pedro  Alva- 
res  Cabral  anchored  off  the  mouth  of  the  Rio  Buranhem 
(sweet  bark  in  Tupi)  on  the  Bahian  coast.  The  chronicler  of 
the  discovery,  Pero  Vaz  de  Caminha,  wrote  that  immediately 
they  saw  men  walking  on  the  beach,  and  by  the  time  a  longboat 
reached  the  shore  twenty  or  so  had  assembled.  Entirely  naked 
and  dark  skinned,  they  laid  down  their  bows  and  arrows  as  a 
sign  of  peace,  while  responding  to  offers  of  Portuguese  hats  by 
giving  over  a  parrot-feathered  headdress  and  a  long  string  of 
white  seed  pearls.  Thus  did  the  cultural  exchange  begin  that 
would  evolve  over  the  next  five  centuries  into  the  distinctive 
Brazilian  culture. 

In  the  nine  days  that  the  Portuguese  stayed  at  the  anchorage 
they  called  Porto  Seguro,  the  natives  were  fascinated  by  the 
Catholic  Mass,  the  iron  tools,  and  alcoholic  drink.  Their  seem- 
ing receptivity  and  lack  of  religious  symbols  that  the  Portu- 
guese could  understand  caused  Caminha  to  predict  that  these 
people  quickly  would  turn  Christian. 

The  natives  helped  fill  a  ship  with  fine-grained  timber,  dye- 
wood,  and  presumably  some  of  the  buranhem  wood  or  bark  that 
gave  the  river  its  name.  Cabral  sent  the  ship  back  to  Lisbon 
with  Caminha's  oft-quoted  letter  to  the  king,  the  first  report  on 
Brazil  to  reach  Europe.  As  the  rest  of  the  fleet  set  sail  from  what 
Cabral  called  the  Island  of  Vera  Cruz  for  the  Cape  of  Good 
Hope,  two  male  convicts  were  left  on  the  shore.  Rather  than 
execute  such  degredados  (outcasts;  see  Glossary),  the  Portu- 
guese were  instinctively  creating  an  advance  guard  that  would 
learn  the  local  language  and  via  intermarriage  would  give 
them  in  another  generation  the  means  to  penetrate  both  the 
indigenous  societies  and  the  Brazilian  land  mass. 

After  so  many  years  of  remarkable  contacts  with  newly  dis- 
covered lands,  the  Portuguese  were  a  bit  blase  about  the  news 
of  this  land  of  parrots,  naked  people,  and  brazilwood.  At  that 
time,  peppers,  spices,  and  silks  were  worth  more  than  such 
exotica,  and  those  products  came  from  India  and  lands  farther 
east. 

With  the  exception  of  the  New  Christian  (Jewish  converts) 
investors,  Brazil  received  little  attention  from  Lisbon  for  three 


14 


Historical  Setting 


decades.  The  investors  scouted  and  defended  the  coast  and 
shared  with  the  crown  their  monopoly  contracts  to  harvest  the 
brazilwood.  The  Portuguese  monarchs  followed  the  practice  of 
holding  legal  title  to  lands  and  to  certain  commodities  but  issu- 
ing to  others  licenses  to  profit  from  these  lands  and  commodi- 
ties at  their  own  expense,  or  with  the  backing  of  other 
investors.  The  custom  was  akin  to  the  Castilian  practice  of 
adelantado  (awarding  of  conquistador  status — see  Glossary) 
that  developed  during  the  reconquest  of  the  Iberian  Peninsula 
from  the  Moors,  whereby  the  crown  commissioned  an  agent  to 
conquer  a  certain  area  at  his  own  expense  in  return  for  rights 
to  land,  booty,  and  labor.  The  combination  of  royal  licenses 
and  private  initiative  that  worked  so  well  for  Portugal  along  the 
African  coast  and  in  India  was  reshaped  for  Brazil. 

But  soon  other  Europeans  were  challenging  Portugal's 
claims  to  exclusivity.  Spanish  captains  edged  their  ships  down 
the  coast  and  up  the  Rio  de  la  Plata.  From  1504  onward, 
French  vessels  from  Brittany,  Flanders,  and  Normandy  were 
active  in  the  dyewood  trade.  The  reddish-purple  dyes  made 
from  the  wood  brought  good  prices  from  tapestry  and  textile 
makers,  and  the  French  court  ignored  Portuguese  protests. 
The  Portuguese  sent  out  naval  expeditions  to  destroy  French 
vessels  and  outposts,  but  by  1530  it  was  clear  that  mounting  an 
effective  coast  guard  along  thousands  of  kilometers  with  count- 
less coves,  anchorages,  and  bays  would  be  impossible;  Portugal 
either  had  to  take  active  possession  or  lose  out  to  more  inter- 
ested rivals.  Portugal  took  two  steps,  one  immediate  and  the 
other  long  term.  It  dispatched  a  strong  fleet  under  the  com- 
mand of  Martim  Afonso  de  Sousa,  who  was  instructed  to  clear 
the  coast  of  interlopers  and  to  establish  a  permanent  settle- 
ment. The  result  was  Brazil's  first  European  town,  Sao  Vicente, 
established  in  1532. 

The  crown  also  may  have  wanted  to  follow  up  on  the  adven- 
ture in  1524  of  Aleixo  Garcia,  a  Portuguese  shipwrecked  on  the 
southern  coast  who  led  about  2,000  Guarani  on  a  raid  against 
Inca  border  towns  in  what  is  now  Bolivia.  Sousa  sent  a  govern- 
ment-sponsored expedition  (entrada)  back  over  Garcia's  route, 
only  to  meet  death  at  the  hands  of  the  Carijo  tribe  of  Indians. 
Such  feeble  results  did  little  to  attract  investors,  so  the  crown 
turned  to  the  hereditary  donatory  captaincy  system  that  had 
succeeded  on  the  islands  of  Madeira  and  the  Azores.  Under 
this  system,  each  donee  was  responsible  for  colonizing  his  own 
captaincy  at  his  own  expense.  To  help  the  lord  proprietor

attract  settlers,  he  was  given  permission  to  issue  land  grants 
(sesmarias) .  This  step  was  significant  because  it  twisted  a  medi- 
eval Portuguese  practice  that  placed  conquered  lands  in  the 
hands  of  peasants  into  one  that  gave  some  families  holdings 
larger  than  Portugal's  provinces.  This  practice  in  part  led  to  the 
establishment  of  latifundia  (see  Glossary)  in  Brazil. 

Nonetheless,  the  nobles  were  not  interested  in  risking  their 
lives  or  fortunes  in  a  land  of  "naked  savages,"  and  most  of  those 
who  received  the  grants  were  too  ill-prepared,  ill-financed,  and 
ill-connected  to  succeed.  The  northern  four  captaincies  never 
went  beyond  the  planning  stage,  and  the  rest  flourished  or 
failed  depending  on  the  management  skills  and  competence 
of  the  donatdrio  in  dealing  with  the  native  Brazilians.  Sousa, 
who  obtained  the  grant  to  Sao  Vicente,  prospered  because  he 
took  advantage  of  Joao  Ramalho,  a  castaway  who  had  married 
the  daughter  of  the  chief  of  the  Goiana  Tupiniquin.  Because  of 
Ramalho,  who  lived  until  1580,  the  Portuguese  were  able  to 
obtain  Indian  labor,  foodstuffs,  and  women.  With  his  help,  it 
was  possible  to  establish  a  town  at  the  village  of  Piratininga, 
which  in  time  would  grow  into  the  metropolis  of  Sao  Paulo.  He 
was  the  key  player  in  the  Portuguese  alliance  with  the  Tupin- 
iquin, who  protected  the  colony  from  other  Indians  and  who 
formed  the  basis  for  the  future  military  power  of  the  bandei- 
rantes.  The  lack  of  European  women  facilitated  assimilation 
and  acculturation  with  the  Indians.  With  the  steady  miscegena- 
tion, a  substantial  population  of  Tupi-speaking  mestizos  (mes- 
tizos or  mamelucos — see  Glossary)  came  into  being. 

Also  important  for  Sao  Vicente's  success  was  Sousa's  ability 
to  attract  investors  for  sugar  mills,  including  an  investor  from 
Antwerp,  which  became  the  center  of  the  European  sugar  mar- 
ket. Although  Pernambuco  in  later  years  surpassed  Sao  Vicente 
in  sugar  production,  its  early  success  fixed  Portuguese  control 
on  what  centuries  later  would  be  the  agricultural  and  industrial 
core  of  Brazil. 

Similarly,  the  affluence  of  Pernambuco  Province  centering 
on  Olinda  resulted  from  successful  interaction  with  the  natives, 
the  ability  to  draw  investment  capital  (often  from  Italian  mer- 
chants), and  capable  settlers.  The  donatdrio,  Duarte  Coelho 
Pereira,  had  married  into  the  well-connected  Albuquerque 
family,  which  helped  him  attract  colonists  and  financial  sup- 
port to  set  up  sugar  mills.  But  he  was  especially  fortunate 
because  his  brother-in-law,  Jeronimo  de  Albuquerque,  had 
married  the  daughter  of  chief  Arcoverde  (Green  Bow)  of  the 


16

Tobajara,  thereby  sealing  an  alliance  that  gave  the  Portuguese 
supplies  of  food  and  workers.  The  alliance  also  gave  Coelho 
Pereira  the  military  superiority  to  eventually  defeat  the  French 
and  their  Indian  allies.  As  the  brazilwood  stands  were  cut  down, 
they  were  replaced  with  sugarcane  plantations,  which  by  1585 
were  served  by  more  than  sixty  mills  or  engenhos.  The  captaincy 
was  so  successful  that  there  was  reputedly  more  luxury  in  Per- 
nambuco  than  in  Lisbon.  This  strong  beginning  would  make  it 
the  northern  focal  point  of  Portuguese  America. 

Porto  Seguro  failed  to  prosper  as  a  captaincy.  The  constant 
fighting  with  the  local  Aimore  people  may  have  been  related  to 
the  presence  of  many  married  Portuguese  couples  and,  conse- 
quently, little  intermarriage  with  the  natives.  Likewise,  Bahia 
failed  at  this  stage  because  its  donatdrio  lacked  managerial  skills. 
Many  of  the  Portuguese  there  were  veterans  of  India,  where 
abuse  of  the  natives  was  routine.  The  Tupinamba  finally  tired 
of  the  mistreatment,  and  many  of  the  Portuguese  at  Bahia, 
including  the  donatdrio,  were  captured  and  ceremonially  killed 
and  eaten.  Ilheus,  Espirito  Santo,  Sao  Tome,  Santo  Amaro,  and 
Santa  Anna  also  failed  because  of  poor  management  and  hos- 
tile relations  with  the  natives.  The  coast  was  now  exposed  to 
French  incursions. 

Such  an  outcome  was  not  what  the  crown  had  in  mind,  and 
it  decided  wisely  to  listen  to  warnings.  Rather  than  replace 
inept  donatdrio >5  with  others,  the  king  established  direct  royal 
control,  except  over  Pernambuco  and  Sao  Vicente.  The  crown 
may  have  acted  at  this  juncture  for  several  reasons:  the  Spanish 
discovery  of  the  famed  silver  mountain  at  Potosi  (1545),  the 
decline  of  the  Asian  spice  trade,  and  the  crown's  practice  of 
reclaiming  royal  control  after  some  years  of  leasing  its  rights. 
The  enhancement  of  royal  power  was  part  of  the  general  Ibe- 
rian pattern  of  establishing  royal  control  over  the  sprawling 
colonial  ventures.  In  a  larger  sense,  renewed  royal  control 
appears  to  have  been  linked  to  a  new  conservatism  in  Catholic 
Europe.  The  Council  of  Trent  (1545-63)  defined  church 
dogma  and  practice,  religious  tolerance  faded,  and  the  Inquisi- 
tion was  emplaced  in  Portugal  in  1547. 

The  king  named  Tome  de  Sousa  the  first  governor  general 
of  Brazil  (1549-53).  He  ordered  Sousa  to  create  a  capital  city, 
Salvador,  on  the  Bahia  de  Todos  os  Santos  (Bay  of  All  Saints) 
and  to  spread  the  royal  mantle  over  the  captaincies,  defending 
the  weaker  ones  and  reestablishing  the  failed  ones.  Because 
Indian  attacks  were  blamed  for  the  failures,  Sousa's  orders 


17 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 


amounted  to  a  declaration  of  war  on  the  indigenous  peoples  of 
Brazil.  If  they  could  be  defeated,  the  French  would  have  no 
allies  and  so  would  be  less  of  a  threat.  In  addition,  Sousa  was  to 
increase  royal  revenues.  The  twin  objectives  of  control  and  rev- 
enue were  characteristic  of  royal  policy  for  the  rest  of  the  colo- 
nial era. 

Bahia,  as  the  city  and  province  would  be  known,  was  selected 
for  its  central  location  and  its  fine  bay,  and  because  the  crown 
had  purchased  it  from  the  heirs  of  the  donatdrio.  Sousa  built 
fortifications,  a  town,  and  sugar  mills.  His  knottiest  task  was 
forming  a  policy  on  the  Indians,  whose  status  remained 
unclear.  Although  he  had  treasury  and  coast  guard  officials 
with  him,  their  roles  were  oriented  toward  Portuguese  colonists 
and  European  interlopers. 

As  early  as  1511,  the  crown  had  placed  the  Indians  under  its 
"protection,"  and  it  ordered  Sousa  to  treat  them  well,  as  long  as 
they  were  peaceful,  so  that  they  could  be  converted.  Conver- 
sion was  essential  because  Portugal's  legal  claims  to  Brazil  were 
based  on  papal  bulls  requiring  Christianization  of  the  Indians. 
However,  those  who  resisted  conversion  were  likened  to  Mus- 
lims and  could  be  enslaved.  In  fact,  as  historian  Sergio  Buarque 
de  Holanda  showed,  by  identifying  Brazil  as  a  destination  of 
the  wandering  Apostle  St.  Thomas  the  Portuguese  settlers  were 
able  to  argue  that  all  natives  had  their  chance  to  convert  and 
had  rejected  it,  so  they  could  be  conquered  and  taken  captive 
legitimately.  Thus,  a  distinction  was  made  between  peaceful, 
pliable  natives  who  as  wards  deserved  crown  protection  and 
those  resisters  who  wanted  to  keep  their  independence  and  on 
whom  'just  war"  could  be  made  and  slavery  imposed. 

The  dual  mission  of  the  governors  was  contradictory;  how 
could  they  stimulate  the  economy  using  slave  labor  while  con- 
verting the  natives?  To  carry  out  the  pacification  and  conver- 
sion of  the  natives,  the  crown  chose  the  new  Jesuit  order  of  the 
Society  of  Jesus,  which  was  international  in  membership  and 
military  in  structure  and  which  had  the  task  of  defending  and 
spreading  the  Catholic  Counter-Reformation.  The  Jesuits  had  a 
major  impact  on  Brazil,  despite  their  small  numbers — 128  by 
1598.  The  Indians  responded  to  the  Jesuits  with  initial  accep- 
tance, then  regression,  evasion,  and  enmity.  The  objective  of 
the  Jesuits  was  to  Europeanize  the  Indians  by  resettling  them  in 
Indian  villages  (aldeias).  In  a  recurring  pattern,  the  first  aldeia 
near  Bahia  (1552)  soon  disintegrated  as  the  Indians  who  sur-

vived  the  European-born  diseases  faded  into  the  interior 
beyond  the  Jesuits'  reach. 

Europeanization  was  overcome  by  a  sort  of  Brazilianization, 
as  the  Jesuits  blended  Indian  songs,  dances,  and  language  into 
the  liturgy  and  as  the  colonists  adopted  native  foods,  women, 
language,  and  customs.  However,  the  first  bishop  of  Brazil 
(1551),  Dom  Pero  Fernandes  Sardinha,  objected  to  the  Jesuit 
accommodation  with  indigenous  culture.  He  threw  the  weight 
of  his  authority  behind  subjugation  and  enslavement.  At  issue 
was  the  nature  of  the  future  of  Brazilian  society.  The  bishop, 
who  had  served  in  Goa  and  ironically  had  taught  Ignatius  Loy- 
ola, the  Jesuit  founder,  insisted  that  Europeanization  must  pre- 
cede baptism.  He  believed  Brazil,  like  India,  should  have  a  dual 
society  made  up  of  heathen  natives  ruled  by  a  small  number  of 
Portuguese. 

The  conflict  between  the  Jesuits  and  the  bishop  had  far- 
reaching  significance  for  Brazil's  future.  To  get  away  from  his 
direct  grasp,  the  Jesuits  shifted  their  attention  to  the  south, 
where  they  formed,  in  1554,  the  aldeia  of  Sao  Paulo  de  Piratin- 
inga  on  the  plateau  at  the  headwaters  of  the  Rio  Tiete  high 
above  Sao  Vicente.  Father  Jose  de  Anchieta's  mission  village 
later  became  known  as  the  city  of  Sao  Paulo.  The  crown  seem- 
ingly favored  the  Jesuit  approach  because  it  recalled  Bishop

Sardinha.  En  route  back,  Sardinha  was  shipwrecked  and  then 
killed  and  reportedly  eaten  by  Caete  people. 

In  1557  the  crown  sent  out  a  new  bishop  and  a  new  governor 
to  consolidate  royal  control  and  to  bring  organization  to  the 
far-flung  settlements  on  the  verge  of  collapse.  The  new  crown 
representatives  supported  Jesuit  methods  and  returned  the 
Jesuits  to  Bahia.  By  protecting  the  Indians  who  lived  in  aldeias 
from  enslavement,  the  crown  representatives  made  the  Jesuit 
towns  more  attractive.  The  pool  of  slaves  available  to  the  colo- 
nists dwindled,  causing  such  protests  that  Mem  de  Sa  (gover- 
nor, 1558-72)  approved  a  'just  war"  against  the  Caete  to  punish 
them  for  killing  Brazil's  first  bishop.  However,  the  "just  war" 
soon  got  out  of  hand  as  the  closer  and  undefended  aldeias  were 
raided  for  slaves.  The  conflict  damaged  native  trust  in  the  mis- 
sions, and  the  epidemics  of  influenza,  smallpox,  and  measles  in 
1562  and  1563  decimated  the  Indian  population  and  increased 
colonist  competition  for  laborers.  The  famine  that  followed  the 
waves  of  disease  prompted  starving  Indians  to  sell  themselves 
or  their  relatives  in  order  to  survive. 

This  situation  led  to  a  policy  under  which  the  Indians  were 
considered  free  but  could  be  enslaved  in  a  sanctioned  "just 
war,"  or  for  cannibalism,  or  if  rescued  from  being  eaten  or 
enslaved  by  other  natives.  Government-sponsored  expeditions 
(entradas)  into  the  interior,  sometimes  ironically  called  rescues 
(resgates),  became  slave  hunts  under  the  guise  of  'just  war."  The 
Paulista  expeditions  (bandeiras),  one  of  the  major  themes  of 
Brazilian  history  in  the  1600s  and  1700s,  would  develop  out  of 
this  practice.  The  eventual  exploitation  of  the  interior  and  the 
development  of  gold  and  gem  mining  in  Minas  Gerais,  Goias, 
and  Mato  Grosso  have  roots  in  the  voracious  appetite  of  coastal 
plantations  for  slave  labor. 

As  Indian  resistance,  social  disintegration,  and  flight  into  the 
interior  increased  in  the  last  quarter  of  the  sixteenth  century, 
the  Portuguese  began  to  import  more  African  slaves.  In  1570 
there  were  2,000  to  3,000  such  slaves  in  Brazil;  by  1587  there 
were  14,000.  Considering  that  the  European  population  in 
1570  was  20,760  and  in  1585  was  29,400,  the  growth  of  African 
slaves  from  14  percent  of  the  number  of  whites  to  47  percent  is 
striking.  Much  of  the  commentary  on  native  slavery  holds  that 
the  Indians  were  unfit  physically  to  be  slaves,  when  actually  it 
was  their  strong  resistance  to  slavery  and  the  colonial  competi- 
tion for  their  labor  that  led  to  the  African  slave  trade.  Also,  the 
focus  of  many  historians  on  Bahia  and  Pernambuco  has  left 


20 


Historical  Setting 


readers  with  the  impression  that  Indian  slavery  gave  way  to 
African  slavery  throughout  Brazil  by  1600.  This  was  not  the 
case.  Indians  continued  to  be  enslaved  in  Para,  which  caused 
the  depopulation  of  much  of  Amazonia  by  the  mid-eighteenth 
century. 

French  and  Dutch  Incursions 

In  addition  to  dealing  with  labor  supply,  Mem  de  Sa,  who 
was  the  consolidator  of  Portuguese  Brazil,  dealt  successfully 
with  the  French  threat.  The  French  had  continued  to  attack 
Portuguese  shipping  and  to  maintain  interest  in  a  permanent 
colony.  Noting  that  Rio  de  Janeiro's  Guanabara  Bay  had  not 
been  occupied,  Vice  Admiral  Nicolas  Durand  de  Villegaignon, 
a  French  navigator,  led  a  mix  of  Huguenots  and  Catholics  there 
in  1555  to  establish  a  colony,  France  Antarctique,  on  Ilha  de 
Sergipe.  After  a  decade,  his  Utopian  dream  of  finding  a  reli- 
gious refuge  for  Protestants  and  Catholics  failed.  Despite  their 
good  relations  with  the  Indians,  the  French  could  not  with- 
stand the  Portuguese  assaults  that  began  in  1565.  That  year,  to 
ensure  future  control  of  the  bay,  Mem  de  Sa  founded  the  city 
of  Rio  de  Janeiro,  which  became  the  second  royal  captaincy. 
Expelled  from  Guanabara  Bay  in  1567,  the  French  turned  their 
efforts  to  the  northern  coast.  They  made  alliances  with  the 
Indians  and  settled  themselves  on  Ilha  Sao  Luis  do  Maranhao 
in  1612,  where  fierce  fighting  led  to  their  expulsion  in  1615. 
They  kept  active  north  of  the  Amazon  delta,  maintaining 
claims  to  Amapa. 

By  1580  the  Portuguese  had  overcome  French  threats  and 
most  indigenous  resistance  to  their  command  of  key  ports.  At 
this  point,  a  more  profound  Spanish  threat  appeared  with  the 
passing  of  the  crown  of  Portugal  to  King  Philip  II  of  Spain.  This 
event  had  immediate  and  long-range  consequences.  Now 
Europe's  two  greatest  empires  were  united  under  a  single  ruler 
and  could  well  have  been  joined  permanently,  save  for  the 
determination  of  the  Portuguese  to  maintain  their  identity. 
The  Iberian  union  gave  the  Portuguese  easier  access  to  the 
Spanish  domains.  For  Brazil,  however,  the  most  important 
result  was  that  it  made  enemies  of  Portugal's  former  business 
associates,  the  Dutch.  Portugal's  commerce  was  more  open 
than  Spain's  and  perhaps  more  practical.  Portugal  recognized 
its  need  for  shipping  and  for  access  to  markets,  both  of  which 
the  Dutch  provided  for  Brazilian  sugar.  The  spirit  of  coopera- 
tion faded  with  the  union  of  the  crowns  as  the  Dutch,  long

struggling  for  independence  from  the  Spanish  Habsburgs, 
were  shut  out  officially  from  the  Portuguese  domains.  This 
exclusion  led  to  the  formation  of  the  Dutch  West  India  Com- 
pany in  1621  and  the  seizure  of  Brazilian  sugar  lands.  After 
being  unsuccessful  in  holding  Salvador  in  1624-25,  the  Dutch 
captured  Pernambuco  in  1630  and  eventually  extended  their 
sway  from  the  Rio  Sao  Francisco  to  Sao  Luis  do  Maranhao  until 
finally  being  forced  out  in  1654. 

The  Dutch  incursion  was  the  longest  and  most  serious  chal- 
lenge to  Portuguese  control  by  a  major  maritime  power.  The 
struggle  to  drive  out  the  Dutch  had  devastating  effects  on  the 
sugar  plantations  and  sugar  mills.  The  Dutch,  particularly  Gov- 
ernor Johan  Maurits,  Count  of  Nassau,  had  worked  to  build 
good  relations  with  the  Portuguese  planters  in  the  interior,  sup- 
plying them  with  credit,  slaves,  merchandise,  and  European 
markets.  Nassau  encouraged  religious  tolerance,  constructed 
buildings  and  canals  in  the  style  of  Amsterdam,  and  brought  in 
artists,  engineers,  and  scientists  to  embellish,  record,  and  study 
the  local  flora,  fauna,  and  peoples. 

Portugal  and  its  Brazilian  subjects  had  divergent  interests  in 
responding  to  the  Dutch.  When  the  Duke  of  Braganca  took  the 
throne  as  Joao  IV  in  1640,  his  government  faced  the  determi- 
nation of  Philip  IV  to  reconquer  Portugal,  and  he  therefore 
needed  to  maintain  peace  with  the  rest  of  Europe.  As  much  as 
the  Portuguese  economy  needed  the  revenues  from  the  sugar 
trade,  the  court  had  to  face  the  reality  that  in  Europe  the 
Dutch  dominated  a  good  portion  of  that  trade.  Thus,  if  Por- 
tugal attacked  Dutch-held  Pernambuco,  it  would  earn  an 
enemy  in  Europe  and  lose  access  to  the  market.  At  the  same 
time,  the  king  understood  the  importance  of  Brazil  when  he 
called  it  his  milk  cow  (vaca  de  kite).  Indeed,  historian  Charles 
Boxer  asserted  that  Portugal's  independence  depended  chiefly 
on  the  Brazil  trade,  which  centered  on  sugar  and  slavery. 

The  Dutch  did  not  show  the  same  hesitation.  In  1641  they 
seized  Luanda,  an  important  source  of  African  slaves,  in  viola- 
tion of  a  truce  with  Portugal.  Holland  now  held  sugar  and  slave 
ports  in  the  South  Atlantic  and  the  distribution  system  in 
Europe.  Although  Lisbon  could  not  merely  abandon  its  sub- 
jects in  Brazil,  it  realized  that  it  would  be  foolhardy  to  fight  for 
the  sugar  area  without  also  regaining  the  source  of  African 
slaves. 

The  colonists  in  the  Dutch-occupied  area  played  their  own 
game  of  deception.  They  borrowed  Dutch  money  to  restore 


22 


Historical  Setting 


their  war-torn  plantations  and  engenhos  and  to  buy  slaves,  but 
they  realized  that  their  long-term  interests  lay  in  expelling  the 
Dutch  and  with  them  their  indebtedness.  After  1645,  together 
with  the  governor  general  in  Bahia,  they  conspired,  rebelled, 
and  fought  against  the  Dutch.  Their  victories  of  1648  and  1649 
at  the  Battle  of  Guararapes  in  the  Recife  area  of  Pernambuco 
are  commemorated  today.  However,  after  nine  years  of  war  the 
scorched-earth  tactics  had  ravaged  the  region.  Although  sugar 
prices  rose  in  Europe,  Brazilian  planters  could  not  respond 
and  permanently  lost  their  leading  market  position.  The  Dutch 
and  English  set  up  plantations  in  Suriname  and  Barbados,  tak- 
ing advantage  of  the  techniques  developed  in  Brazil  and  their 
better  access  to  capital,  merchant  fleets,  and  the  northern 
European  market.  Although  there  were  years  of  recovery 
(1665-80,  1698-1710),  sugar  was  no  longer  the  foundation  of 
the  Brazilian  economy.  Northeastern  Brazil  entered  into  a  long 
stagnation,  and  Portugal,  which  now  depended  heavily  on  Bra- 
zil after  its  losses  to  the  Dutch  in  the  East  Indies,  watched  its 
economy  deteriorate. 

Gold  Mining  Displaces  Cane  Farming 

The  decline  in  the  sugar  economy  cut  off  the  smaller  North- 
eastern cane  farmers  from  the  customary  paths  to  higher  socio- 
economic status,  producing  a  situation  in  which  this  potentially 
powerful  segment  of  the  population  no  longer  had  reasons  to 
support  the  traditional  colonial  society.  The  cane  farmers  had 
the  same  social  origins  as  the  wealthier  planter  and  mill-owner 
class  but  generally  were  less  independent  financially,  and  now 
their  future  was  darkened.  As  sugar  prices  fell,  the  planters  and 
mill  owners'  response  was  vertical  integration  (see  Glossary); 
stages  of  production  were  consolidated  under  the  control  of 
fewer  firms.  Purchases  from  independent  cane  farmers  were 
reduced  and  their  lands  acquired.  The  situation  was  potentially 
explosive.  Historian  Stuart  Schwartz  commented  that  "at  no 
time  in  Brazilian  history  had  the  conditions  for  a  profound 
social  upheaval  been  more  suitable."  But  it  did  not  occur  for 
two  reasons:  the  cane  farmers  did  not  rebel  against  the  sugar 
barons  for  fear  of  encouraging  a  slave  rebellion,  and  in  addi- 
tion, newly  discovered  gold  fields  to  the  south  soon  beckoned 
to  free  and  slave  populations.  The  removal  of  pressures  for 
change  solidified  the  hold  of  the  great  landowners  on  the 
coastal  plantations.

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Small  deposits  of  alluvial  gold  had  been  exploited  quietly  for 
decades  in  Sao  Paulo  and  to  the  south.  The  Paulistas  likely 
found  more  than  they  revealed,  fearing  that  the  greed  of  the 
Portuguese  authorities  would  soon  strip  them  of  their  semi- 
independence.  The  discovery  of  gold  by  Paulistas  in  various 
parts  of  what  is  now  Minas  Gerais  (General  Mines),  between 
the  Serra  de  Mantiqueira  and  the  headwaters  of  the  Rio  Sao 
Francisco,  probably  occurred  between  1693  and  1695,  but 
word  filtered  out  slowly.  The  greatest  concentration  of  deposits 
was  along  Brazil's  oldest  geological  formation,  the  Serra  do 
Espinhaco,  lying  in  a  north-south  direction,  throughout  which 
it  seemed  that  every  river,  stream,  and  brook  glittered  with 
gold.  Mining  camps  that  turned  into  the  cities  of  Ouro  Preto, 
Mariana,  and  Sabara  soon  located  in  its  southern  end,  and  by 
1730  diamonds  were  coming  out  of  the  northern  reaches 
around  Diamantina. 

Word  of  the  discoveries  set  off  an  unprecedented  rush,  the 
likes  of  which  would  not  be  seen  again  until  the  California  gold 
rush  of  1849.  The  Paulistas  soon  found  themselves  competing 
for  control  with  adventurers  from  the  Northeast  who  streamed 
down  the  Vale  Sao  Francisco,  from  Portugal,  and  from  else- 
where. By  1709-10  the  Vale  Sao  Francisco  had  become  a  lawless 
region  filled  with  the  dregs  of  the  Portuguese  world.  Consider- 
able violence  broke  out  between  the  original  Paulista  bandei- 
rantes,  who  considered  the  mines  theirs,  and  the  outsiders 
(emboabas) .  This  fighting  gave  the  crown  authorities  a  reason 
for  asserting  royal  control  and  arranging  a  settlement  of  the 
War  of  the  Outsiders  (Guerra  dos  Emboabas,  1708-09).  Many 
Paulistas  moved  on  to  new  gold  discoveries  in  Goias  and  Mato 
Grosso. 

The  discoveries  shifted  Brazil's  center  of  gravity  away  from 
the  Northeastern  coast  and  toward  the  South  and  West.  The 
loser  would  be  Bahia,  which  in  1763  lost  the  viceregal  capital  to 
Rio  de  Janeiro,  as  power  followed  wealth.  The  population  also 
shifted,  as  would-be  miners  and  those  who  would  profit  from 
the  mines  arrived  with  their  native  or  African  slaves.  The  Jesuit 
Father  Andre Joao  Antonil  (whose  Italian  name  was  Giovanni 
Antonio  Andreoni)  wrote  the  best  contemporary  study  of  Bra- 
zilian economic  and  social  conditions.  He  said  that  by  1709 
some  30,000  people  were  in  Minas  Gerais.  In  the  next  decades, 
the  population  swelled.  The  1735  tax  records  showed  a  total  of 
100,141  slaves,  among  whom  there  were  numerous  natives.  By 
1782  Minas  Gerais's  population  of  319,769  included  166,995

blacks,  82,110  mulattoes,  and  70,664  whites.  The  state  had  the 
largest  concentration  of  population  in  the  viceroyalty  of  Brazil: 
20.5  percent  of  Brazil's  1,555,200  people. 

The  early  population  consisted  predominantly  of  unruly 
males,  who  knew  no  law  but  their  own  whims  and  who  drove 
their  slaves  hard  in  an  existence  that  historian  Charles  Boxer 
tagged  as  "nasty,  brutish,  and  short."  Many  African  slaves 
reacted  by  running  away  to  form  hiding  places  called  quihmbos 
and  were  pursued  by  roughneck  "bushwhacking  captains" 
{capitdes  do  mato).  However,  during  the  first  decades  life  could 
not  have  been  easy  for  anyone.  Items  such  as  meat,  corn,  flour, 
and  rum  were  rare  and  costly.  The  first  local  supply  of  hogs  and 
chickens  appeared  only  in  1723,  and  a  flask  of  salt  could  cost  as 
much  as  half  a  pound  of  gold. 

By  the  last  decades  of  the  eighteenth  century,  however,  the 
cities  of  Minas  Gerais  were  graced  with  impressive  baroque  and 
rococo  churches,  multistoried  homes  and  shops,  and  grand 
public  buildings.  Poets  and  musicians  enlivened  the  cultural 
scene.  Some  3,000  musicians,  mostly  mulattoes,  played  fine 
baroque  pieces,  often  in  churches  built  by  architect  Antonio 
Francisco  Lisboa  (also  known  as  "O  Aleijadinho")  and  under 
ceilings  painted  by  Manuel  da  Costa  Ataide. 

The  overland  trails  from  Sao  Paulo  and  from  Parati  were 
superseded  by  ones  connecting  to  Rio  de  Janeiro.  The  new 
viceregal  capital  sent  African  slaves  and  European  merchandise 
to  Minas  Gerais  and  received  the  heavily  laden  chests  of  gold 
and  diamonds  en  route  to  Lisbon.  Rio  de  Janeiro  also  served  as 
the  supply  base  for  the  newly  created  captaincies  of  Santa  Cata- 
rina  and  Rio  Grande  de  Sao  Pedro,  passing  their  livestock 
products  on  to  Portugal.  Those  captaincies  were  linked  over- 
land to  Sao  Paulo  and  Minas  Gerais  via  the  livestock  trails  that 
ran  northeast  from  the  pampas  of  what  was  later  called  Rio 
Grande  do  Sul  to  Sorocaba  in  Sao  Paulo  Province. 

Ranching  had  developed  in  the  Northeastern  interior  as  an 
adjunct  to  the  sugar  economy  and  in  the  South  as  the  legacy  of 
the  Jesuit  missions.  In  the  eighteenth  century,  ranching  was  an 
increasingly  important  part  of  the  overall  colonial  economy. 
The  moving  frontiers  that  it  created  drew  the  interior  into 
effective  relationships  with  European-oriented  Brazil.  From  the 
interior  of  Maranhao,  southeast  through  Piam,  Ceara,  Pernam- 
buco,  and  Bahia,  then  west  into  Goias,  and  on  down  to  Rio 
Grande  do  Sul,  a  set  of  cowboy  (vaqueiro)  subcultures  evolved 
that  still  mark  local  traditions.  It  was  an  age  of  leather  in  which 


26 


Historical  Setting 


the  horse  was  the  center  of  life.  Many,  perhaps  most,  of  the 
vaqueiros  were  native  Indians,  mestizos,  African  slaves,  and 
mulattoes.  In  the  northern  and  central  areas,  slaves  and  free 
men  worked  together  unsupervised  for  months  at  a  time.  In 
the  South,  the  gaucho  culture,  mixing  native,  Spanish,  and 
Portuguese  bloodlines  and  traditions,  took  hold  throughout 
the  pampas  of  the  Rio  de  la  Plata  up  into  Rio  Grande  do  Sul.  In 
the  latter  state,  by  the  mid-1 820s  cattle  had  driven  out  wheat 
farming,  and  the  mounted  gaucho  with  his  bolas,  knife,  mate 
tea,  and  open-fire  barbecued  beef  became  characteristic. 

Although  gold  mining  weakened  the  dominance  of  sugar 
and  seemingly  stimulated  the  cattle  industry,  it  did  not  totally 
supersede  export  agriculture.  It  displaced  sugar  as  the  colony's 
leading  economic  activity,  but  during  the  eighteenth  century 
the  value  of  gold  exports  never  surpassed  the  value  of  sugar-led 
agricultural  exports.  Even  so,  gold  did  have  serious  long-term 
effects  on  Portugal.  The  fall  in  the  value  of  Portugal's  colonial 
products  in  the  seventeenth  century  had  made  it  difficult  to 
obtain  sufficient  currency  to  purchase  merchandise  from 
northern  Europe.  In  response,  Portugal  had  begun  to  develop 
industries  to  meet  its  local  and  colonial  requirements.  The  dis- 
covery of  gold  provided  needed  currency. 

In  1703  Portugal  signed  the  Methuen  Treaty  with  England, 
giving  English  woolens  preference  in  Portuguese  markets  in 
return  for  a  favorable  tariff  on  Portuguese  wines.  This  seem- 
ingly simple  arrangement  ended  the  move  toward  industrial 
development,  drained  Brazilian  gold  out  of  Portugal,  and  gave 
England  its  increasing  dominance  over  Portugal  and  Brazil. 
The  gold  and  diamond  chests  arriving  at  the  royal  treasury  in 
Lisbon  immediately  were  dispatched  north  to  pay  for  imported 
cloth  and  manufactured  goods.  Local  Portuguese  producers 
could  not  compete  with  cheaper  foreign  prices.  Furthermore, 
English  vessels  anchored  in  the  Tagus  River  in  the  Iberian  Pen- 
insula snatched  large  quantities  of  gold  from  under  the  noses 
of  Portuguese  authorities.  Instead  of  Brazil's  wealth  being  used 
to  develop  Portugal  and  its  colonies,  it  helped  finance  the 
English  industrial  revolution  and  Portugal's  eighteenth-cen- 
tury struggles  to  secure  Brazilian  boundaries. 

Even  though  an  immense  amount  of  wealth  was  sent  abroad, 
much  stayed  in  Brazil  to  build  urban  public  works,  such  as 
fountains,  bridges,  buildings,  and  churches;  to  endow  some 
charitable  foundations,  such  as  hospitals;  and  to  finance  the 
elaborate  contraband  trade  with  the  Rio  de  la  Plata  and  Alto

Peru  (Upper  Peru,  or  present-day  Bolivia).  However,  it  did  not 
improve  the  condition  of  the  poor;  generate  a  prosperous  mid- 
dle class;  improve  agriculture,  education,  or  industry;  or  pro- 
duce lasting  reform. 

In  1732  Antonio  Rodrigues  da  Costa,  a  member  of  the  Over- 
seas Council,  warned  the  crown  that  the  heavy  colonial  taxes 
would  one  day  lead  the  colonists  to  cast  off  their  loyalty.  It  was 
obvious  to  Rodrigues  da  Costa  that  the  "larger  and  richer" 
would  not  accept  forever  being  ruled  by  the  "smaller  and 
poorer."  In  1738  royal  adviser  Dom  Luis  da  Cunha  suggested 
secretly  to  King  Joao  V  that  he  take  the  title  "emperor  of  the 
west"  and  move  his  court  to  Rio  de  Janeiro,  which  he  argued 
was  better  situated  than  Lisbon  to  control  the  Portuguese  mari- 
time and  commercial  empire.  Rather  than  heed  such  advice, 
however,  the  monarchy  tried  at  mid-century  to  gain  more  con- 
trol, stop  the  massive  outflow  of  gold,  and  contain  the  British. 
Beginning  in  1755,  Marques  de  Pombal  (Count  Sebastiao  Jose 
de  Carvalho  e  Melo),  as  secretary  of  state  for  overseas  domin- 
ions, shaped  a  series  of  reforms  that  gave  chartered  companies 
a  monopoly  of  the  Brazil  trade,  encouraged  national  manufac- 
turers, and  worked  to  make  commercial  relations  with  Britain 
less  dependent  and  more  reciprocal.  His  goal  was  to  revitalize 
the  state  and  to  break  the  stranglehold  of  British  credit.  He 
closed  Brazilian  ports  to  all  foreign  ships  and  hired  foreign  mil- 
itary experts  to  organize  Brazil's  defenses.  To  promote  agricul- 
tural growth,  Pombal  distributed  coffee  and  mulberry 
seedlings  and  also  advocated  production  of  indigo,  flax,  cot- 
ton, cocoa,  and  rice.  Iron  mining  and  smelting  got  underway 
in  Sao  Paulo,  and  shipbuilding  and  its  attendant  trades  in 
Bahia  and  Rio  de  Janeiro  increased.  With  the  British  seizure  of 
Havana  and  Manila  during  the  Seven  Years'  War  (1756-63),  the 
Portuguese  wondered  if  Rio  de  Janeiro  would  be  next.  The 
crown  responded  with  four  goals:  secure  the  borders,  populate 
them  for  self-defense,  defend  the  ports,  and  make  the  mines 
profitable. 

Pombal  distrusted  the  Jesuits,  who  controlled  vast  areas  in 
the  interior  of  South  America.  He  suspected  commercial  links 
between  their  prosperous  missions  and  the  British,  and  in  Sep- 
tember 1759  expelled  them  from  Brazil.  The  expulsion  of  the 
Jesuits  caused  the  missions  to  fall  to  ruin  and  eliminated  the 
strongest  educational  institutions  in  Brazil.  Crown  policy  for- 
bade any  university  or  even  a  printing  press  in  the  colony,  and 
modern  Brazilian  universities  date  only  from  the  1930s. 


28 


Historical  Setting 


The  crown's  education  policy  was  based  on  the  idea  that 
colonial  and  metropolitan  elites  would  blend  to  shape  an  impe- 
rial elite  united  by  ideology  in  support  of  the  crown.  During 
the  colonial  era,  3,000  Brazilians  studied  at  Portugal's  Univer- 
sity of  Coimbra,  which  in  1772  Pombal  reformed  with  Enlight- 
enment perspectives.  Between  1772  and  1785,  300  Brazilians, 
many  from  Minas  Gerais,  were  at  Coimbra.  Pombal  placed 
these  graduates  and  other  members  of  the  colonial  plutocracy 
injudicial,  administrative,  and  military  posts.  However,  policy 
intention  and  outcome  often  clashed.  Some  of  these  students 
and  officials  would  begin  to  think  in  terms  of  independence. 

The  production  of  gold  began  to  decline  about  1750  as  the 
Minas  Gerais  society  was  solidifying  and  as  the  international  sit- 
uation was  becoming  more  complicated.  The  more  the  Portu- 
guese squeezed  and  tried  to  reduce  the  contraband  in  gold  and 
diamonds,  the  more  the  divergence  of  interests  grew.  In  the 
1770s,  as  less  gold  reached  royal  coffers,  the  crown  reacted  by 
imposing  a  per  capita  tax  (derrama)  to  make  up  the  difference 
between  the  amounts  expected  and  those  received.  Meanwhile, 
competition  from  British,  French,  and  Dutch  colonies  pushed 
the  price  of  Brazilian  sugar  down  lower  on  the  Amsterdam 
market,  reducing  still  more  Portuguese  revenues.  Moreover, 
the  decline  in  available  gold  affected  the  contraband  trade  that 
the  Brazilians  had  carried  on  with  the  Rio  de  la  Plata  area, 
where  they  exchanged  their  illicit  gold  for  Andean  silver.  The 
Brazilians  then  used  the  silver  to  buy  illegal  British  goods, 
which  they  smuggled  back  into  the  Spanish  domains.  The  elim- 
ination of  the  Jesuit  missions,  Spain's  creation  of  the  Viceroy- 
alty  of  the  Rio  de  la  Plata  (1776),  and  the  opening  of  direct 
trade  between  Spain  and  Buenos  Aires  further  reduced  the 
profitable  trade  in  smuggled  goods  (see  fig.  2).  The  decline  in 
smuggling  reduced  transshipments  of  British  goods  through 
Portugal,  reducing  that  country's  overall  level  of  trade  with 
Britain  catastrophically.  The  ensuing  recession  made  it  difficult 
to  pay  for  the  military  expeditions  sent  to  the  southern  borders 
during  the  1770s,  and  the  crown  was  unable  to  adjust  expendi- 
tures in  the  face  of  declining  revenues. 

In  Minas  Gerais,  landowners  had  manufacturing  establish- 
ments on  their  properties  turning  out  cotton,  linen,  and 
woolen  items,  and  most  of  the  other  captaincies  had  "work- 
shops and  manufactories"  that  lessened  the  need  to  import 
from  Portugal.  The  basis  for  a  more  complex  textile  industry 
was  being  laid.

Then,  in  February  1777,  Jose  I  (king  of  Portugal,  1750-77) 
died,  and  with  him  went  Pombal's  hold  on  power  and  his  com- 
mon sense  approach  of  encouraging  industrial  development. 
Pombal's  successor  as  secretary  of  state  for  overseas  dominions, 
Martinho  de  Melo  e  Castro,  was  alarmed  that  the  nascent  Bra- 


30 


Historical  Setting 


zilian  factories  could  make  the  colony  independent  and 
warned  that  "Portugal  without  Brazil  is  an  insignificant  power." 
In  January  1785,  he  ordered  that  they  all  be  "closed  and  abol- 
ished." 

In  the  early  1780s,  Brazilian  students  at  Coimbra  had 
pledged  themselves  to  seek  independence.  They  were  influ- 
enced greatly  by  the  success  of  the  North  American  British  col- 
onies in  forming  the  United  States  of  America.  In  1786  and 
1787,  Jose  Joaquim  Maia  e  Barbalho  of  Rio  de  Janeiro,  a  Coim- 
bra graduate  studying  medicine  at  Montpelier  and  a  critic  of 
the  colonial  relationship,  approached  Ambassador  Thomas  Jef- 
ferson in  France.  He  told  Jefferson  that  the  students  intended 
to  break  with  Portugal  and  requested  the  aid  of  the  United 
States.  One  of  the  Coimbra  graduates  was  Jose  Bonifacio  de 
Andrada  e  Silva,  the  patriarch  of  Brazilian  independence. 

The  failed  Minas  Conspiracy  (Inconfidencia  Mineira)  of 
1789  involved  some  of  the  leading  figures  of  the  captaincy:  tax 
collectors,  priests,  military  officers,  judges,  government  offi- 
cials, and  mine  owners  and  landowners.  Some  had  been  born 
in  Portugal,  several  had  their  early  education  with  the  Jesuits 
and  later  studied  at  Coimbra,  a  number  wrote  poetry  that  is 
still  read  and  studied.  But  what  they  had  most  in  common  were 
financial  problems  caused  by  crown  policies  that  required 
them  to  pay  their  debts,  or  that  cut  them  out  of  lucrative  gold 
and  diamond  contraband  trade.  They  argued  that  Brazil  had 
all  it  needed  to  survive  and  prosper  and  that  Portugal  was  a 
parasite.  They  pledged  to  lift  restrictions  on  mining;  exploit 
iron  ore;  set  up  factories;  create  a  university,  a  citizens'  militia, 
and  a  Parliament;  pardon  debts  to  the  royal  treasury;  free 
slaves  born  in  Brazil;  and  form  a  union  with  Sao  Paulo  and  Rio 
de  Janeiro  similar  to  that  of  the  United  States. 

The  history  of  the  Minas  Conspiracy  is  full  of  heavy  drama. 
Revelation  of  the  conspiracy  turned  brothers,  friends,  clients, 
and  patrons  against  each  other  in  an  unseemly  scramble  to 
escape  punishment.  In  one  sense,  the  affair  foreshadowed  the 
nature  of  future  Brazilian  revolutionary  movements  in  that  it 
was  a  conspiracy  of  oligarchs  seeking  their  own  advantage, 
while  claiming  to  act  for  the  people.  In  the  end,  Lisbon 
decided  to  make  an  example  of  only  one  person,  a  low-ranked 
second  lieutenant  (alferes)  of  the  Royal  Mineiro  Dragoons 
named  Joaquim  Jose  da  Silva  Xavier  ("Tiradentes").  His  execu- 
tion in  1792  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  might  well  have  been  forgotten  if 
the  nineteenth-century  republicans  had  not  embraced  him  as  a 


31 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

symbolic  counterpoise  to  Dom  Pedro  I,  who  declared  Brazilian 
independence  from  Portugal  in  1822.  Later,  with  the  establish- 
ment of  the  republic  in  1889,  every  town  and  city  in  Brazil  built 
a  Tiradentes  square,  and  the  day  of  his  execution,  April  21, 
became  a  well-commemorated  national  holiday.  Nonetheless, 
because  the  Minas  Conspiracy  was  marked  more  by  skuldug- 
gery than  nobility  and  clarity,  its  value  as  a  national  symbol 
required  selective  interpretation  and  presentation. 

Portugal  resolved  to  watch  Brazilians  more  carefully  and 
reacted  forcefully  to  a  nonexistent  but  suspected  plot  in  Rio  de 
Janeiro  in  1794,  and  to  a  real,  mulatto-led  one  in  Bahia  in  1798. 
Meanwhile,  the  French  Revolution,  the  resulting  slave  rebel- 
lion in  Haiti,  and  the  fear  of  similar  revolts  in  Brazil  convinced 
the  Brazilian  elites  that  the  dream  of  a  United  States-style  con- 
servative revolution  that  would  leave  the  slave-based  socioeco- 
nomic structure  intact  and  in  their  hands  was  impossible.  The 
crown  separated  the  residents  of  Minas  Gerais  from  the  revived 
coastal  sugar  producers  through  policies  that  set  their  interests 
at  odds.  Lisbon  diverted  Brazilian  nationalism  with  greater 
imperial  involvement. 

The  Transition  to  Kingdom  Status 

With  the  onset  of  the  Napoleonic  Wars,  some  Portuguese 
officials  again  raised  the  idea  of  moving  the  crown  to  the  safety 
of  Brazil.  Dom  Luis  da  Cunha's  prophetic  suggestion  in  1738 
that  Rio  de  Janeiro  was  "safer  and  more  convenient"  made 
great  sense  as  the  French  army  approached  Lisbon  in  Novem- 
ber 1807.  The  British  in  1801  had  recommended  transfer  to 
Brazil  in  the  event  of  an  invasion  and  had  promised  to  provide 
protection  for  the  voyage  and  assistance  in  extending  and  con- 
solidating Portuguese  territory  in  South  America.  In  1803  the 
Lisbon  government,  faced  with  the  increasingly  deadly  struggle 
between  France  and  Britain,  had  reconsidered  the  idea.  The 
choice  was  between  losing  Portugal  to  the  French  and  having 
the  British  seize  Brazil,  or  moving  the  crown  to  Brazil,  from 
which  the  struggle  for  Portugal  could  be  resumed.  In  any  case, 
the  royal  government  did  not  move  until  Portugal  was  actually 
invaded  in  late  1807. 

At  the  time,  the  monarch  was  Queen  Maria  I,  but  because  of 
mental  illness  triggered  by  her  horror  at  the  regicide  in  Paris, 
her  son  Dom  Joao  ruled  as  regent.  His  wife  was  Dona  Carlota 
Joaquina,  a  Spanish  princess  and  mother  to  their  nine  chil- 
dren, among  whom  the  most  important  for  Brazilian  history

was  Pedro  de  Alcantara  de  Braganca  e  Bourbon.  Dom  Joao 
opened  Brazilian  ports  to  world  commerce,  allowing  British 
goods  to  stream  in,  and  eliminating  the  Portuguese  middle- 
men. Rio  de  Janeiro  substituted  for  Lisbon  in  a  centralized  sys- 
tem that  placed  the  various  captaincies  in  subservient  positions 
to  the  new  center.  For  the  Brazilian  elites,  the  transfer  of  the 
court  meant  that  they  could  have  conservative  political  change 
without  social  disorder.  And  best  of  all,  depending  on  their 
proximity  to  the  court,  they  had  the  chance  to  obtain  the  titles 
and  honors  that  they  felt  their  wealth  had  earned  them.  How- 
ever, the  pleasure  of  the  elites  was  mixed  with  some  frustration 
because  now  the  monarch  was  close  enough  to  keep  an  atten- 
tive watch  on  how  they  conducted  their  affairs.  And  with  the 
court  in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  the  demands  of  international  politics 
were  more  keenly  felt. 

Portugal  and  the  Braganca  dynasty  were  obligated  deeply  to 
the  British.  The  British  not  only  saved  the  royal  family  and 
some  15,000  courtiers  but  also  lent  US$3  million  in  1809  to 
keep  the  government  functioning.  The  British  also  liberated 
Portugal  from  the  French  and  reorganized  the  Portuguese 
army.  In  addition,  one  of  their  officers  ruled  as  regent  in  Lis- 
bon. The  Portuguese  therefore  had  little  with  which  to  bargain 
when  negotiating  treaties.  In  1810  Dom  Joao  signed  agree- 
ments not  only  giving  the  British  trade  preferences  and  allow- 
ing them  privileges  of  extraterritoriality  but  also  promising  to 
abolish  the  African  slave  trade.  The  last  cut  directly  at  the  inter- 
ests of  the  propertied  classes,  on  whom  the  crown  depended. 

The  crown  had  to  duplicate,  mostly  from  scratch,  the  gov- 
ernment institutions  it  had  left  behind  in  Lisbon.  It  set  up  a 
Supreme  Military  Council  (Conselho  Militar  Superior);  boards 
of  treasury,  trade,  agriculture,  and  industry;  a  Court  of 
Appeals;  a  royal  printing  press  and  official  newspaper;  and  the 
Bank  of  Brazil  (Banco  do  Brasil) .  It  created  medical  schools  in 
Bahia  and  Rio  de  Janeiro,  a  school  of  fine  arts,  a  museum  of 
natural  history,  a  public  library,  and  the  Botanical  Garden 
(Jardim  Botanico)  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  It  also  set  up  specialized 
courses  of  study  in  the  Minas  Gerais  towns  of  Ouro  Preto  and 
Paracatu.  Most  of  the  fleet  had  been  transferred,  but  a  new 
army  was  organized,  naval  and  military  academies  were  estab- 
lished, and  arsenals  created.  The  crown  built  a  powder  factory 
and  an  ironworks.  It  dealt  with  public  safety  by  forming  the 
Royal  Police  Guard,  which  brutalized  slaves,  sailors,  drunks, 
gamblers,  and  prostitutes  into  submission.  The  crown  also 


33 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

opened  Brazil  to  European  travelers,  naturalists,  scientists,  and 
artists,  who  left  a  detailed  picture  of  its  life  and  landscape. 

Curiously,  by  staying  in  Brazil  after  the  British  liberated  Por- 
tugal from  the  French  in  1811,  the  crown  was  keeping  British 
influence  under  some  control,  because  here  it  was  removed 
both  from  Britain  and  the  British-commanded  Portuguese 
army.  In  1815  the  crown,  determined  to  set  its  own  course, 
raised  Brazil  to  a  kingdom  equal  with  Portugal  and  acclaimed 
Joao  as  king  when  his  mother  died  in  1816.  The  crown  gained 
further  maneuverability  by  arranging  marriages  between  the 
two  princesses  and  the  Spanish  King  Fernando  VII  and  his 
brother,  and  more  important,  between  Crown  Prince  Pedro 
and  the  daughter  of  Franz  I  of  Austria,  the  Archduchess 
Leopoldina. 

The  Kingdom  of  Portugal  and  Brazil,  1815-21 

Portuguese  businessmen  who  invested  locally  in  Brazil, 
nobles  and  government  officials  who  built  expensive  homes 
there,  and  those  who  married  into  provincial  wealth  shared  a 
common  interest  in  remaining.  Indeed,  what  took  shape  was  a 
new  concept  of  a  dual  monarchy  of  Brazil  and  Portugal,  which 
even  under  the  best  of  circumstances  would  have  been  difficult 
to  make  work.  It  was  an  expedient  idea  that  would  founder 
because  of  resistance  by  those  in  Portugal  who  saw  their  status 
and  that  of  the  kingdom  endangered;  by  the  British,  who 
wanted  the  king  back  in  Lisbon,  where  he  was  more  vulnerable; 
and  by  the  unwillingness  of  Brazilians  to  suffer  the  indignity  of 
being  returned  to  colonial  rank. 

The  centralization  of  power  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  met  with  vio- 
lent resistance  in  the  Northeast.  When  Pernambuco  raised  the 
banner  of  republican  rebellion  in  1817,  it  was  followed  by 
Parafba  do  Norte,  Rio  Grande  do  Norte,  and  the  south  of 
Ceara,  each  of  which  acted  to  defend  local  interests  without 
thought  of  federating.  They  resented  their  loss  of  autonomy  to 
Rio  de  Janeiro  and  the  Portuguese  who  had  settled  in  the 
Northeast  since  1808.  Significantly,  although  they  sent  envoys 
to  secure  recognition  from  Britain  and  the  United  States  and 
to  spread  the  revolt  to  Bahia,  they  did  not  send  agents  to  cen- 
tral or  southern  Brazil.  The  revolt  was  crushed  brutally. 
Although  unsuccessful,  the  1817  "Pernambuccan  revolution" 
shook  the  monarchy's  foundations  because  it  had  pushed  aside 
authority  and  tarnished  the  crown's  aura  of  invincibility.  In  des- 
peration, the  monarchy  responded  by  banning  all  secret  societ- 


34 


Historical  Setting 


ies  and  by  garrisoning  Rio  de  Janeiro,  Salvador,  and  Recife  with 
fresh  troops  from  Portugal. 

Meanwhile,  the  monarchy  was  waging  war  in  the  Rio  de  la 
Plata.  King  Joao  regarded  the  East  Bank  of  the  Rio  de  la  Plata 
(present-day  Uruguay)  as  the  proper  and  true  boundary  of 
Brazil.  Over  British  objections,  he  brought  veteran  troops  from 
Portugal  to  seize  Montevideo  and  to  wage  a  wearing  campaign 
(1816-20)  against  the  forces  of  independence-minded  Jose 
Gervasio  Artigas,  the  father  of  Uruguay.  The  region  was  incor- 
porated into  the  United  Kingdom  as  the  Cisplatine  Province  in 
1821.  Nonetheless,  even  as  it  was  expanding,  the  United  King- 
dom, as  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  royalists  termed  it,  was  suffering 
from  pressures  in  Portugal  itself. 

The  Pernambuccan  revolution  in  1817  encouraged  army 
officers  in  Portugal  to  conspire  against  the  regency  of  British 
Marshal  William  Carr  Beresford.  Twelve  of  the  conspirators, 
including  a  general  officer,  were  tried  secretly  and  hanged. 
Anti-British  sentiment  deepened.  In  1820,  when  a  military 
revolt  in  Spain  forced  the  revived  absolutist  regime  of  Fer- 
nando VII  (1784-1833)  to  restore  the  liberal  constitution  of 
1812,  the  Portuguese  military  followed  suit  by  expelling  the 
British  officers  and  forming  revolutionary  juntas.  The  military 
petitioned  the  king's  return  and  summoned  a  Cortes  (the  Por- 
tuguese Parliament),  the  first  since  1697  when  the  crown  had 
dispensed  with  such  bodies. 

Unable  to  do  more,  Joao  pardoned  the  juntas'  usurpation  of 
his  prerogative  to  summon  a  Cortes  and  acknowledged  that  a 
Cortes  could  be  useful  in  making  proposals  to  him  on  how  best 
to  govern  the  United  Kingdom.  Then,  in  January  1821,  Portu- 
guese officers  and  troops,  as  well  as  Brazilian  liberals,  took  over 
provincial  governments  in  Bahia  and  Belem,  and  in  late  Febru- 
ary, troops  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  threw  in  with  the  movement  and 
forced  the  king  to  take  an  oath  to  accept  any  constitution  the 
Cortes  might  write.  In  effect,  Brazil  was  again  being  ruled  from 
Portugal.  A  few  days  later,  a  royal  decree  announced  that  the 
king  would  return  to  Lisbon,  leaving  his  twenty-four-year-old 
son  Dom  Pedro  as  regent  in  Brazil. 

On  April  25,  1821,  twelve  ships  carrying  the  king  and  queen, 
4,000  officials,  diplomats,  and  families,  as  well  as  purloined 
funds  and  jewels  from  the  Bank  of  Brazil,  set  course  for  Lisbon. 
The  city  and  country  that  they  left  behind  no  longer  consti- 
tuted the  closed  colony  of  thirteen  years  before.  Thanks  to  the 
surveys,  expeditions,  and  studies  that  Joao  had  encouraged, 


35 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Brazil's  resources  would  be  exploited  at  a  steadily  increasing 
pace,  but  in  a  fashion  that  tied  the  country  more  closely  to  the 
rapidly  expanding  industrial  capitalism  of  the  North  Atlantic. 
Nonetheless,  Joao  VI  and  Queen  Carlota  exemplified  the  fad- 
ing absolutist  regime;  their  son  Pedro  would  seek  to  be  more 
modern  by  embracing  the  new  ideas  of  liberal  constitutional- 
ism. 

During  the  thirteen  years  that  Joao  resided  in  Rio  de 
Janeiro,  international  trade  expanded  as  reflected  by  the  grow- 
ing number  of  foreign  ships  anchoring  in  the  bay:  from  ninety 
in  1808  to  354  in  1820.  By  1820  Rio  de  Janeiro  had  more  than 
3,000  foreigners  among  its  113,000  inhabitants. 

Rio  de  Janeiro  also  had  coffee  houses  serving  the  product 
that  would  become  the  backbone  of  the  economy.  Expanding 
from  seedlings  nurtured  in  the  Jardim  Botanico,  coffee  cultiva- 
tion spread  from  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  area  over  the  Serra  do  Mar 
into  the  fertile  upland  valley,  through  which  the  Rio  Parafba 
flows  from  Sao  Paulo  easterly  to  the  sea,  dividing  the  provinces 
of  Minas  Gerais  and  Rio  de  Janeiro.  On  both  sides  of  the  river, 
the  tropical  forests  were  cut  to  make  way  for  the  coffee  groves. 
Mule  trains  that  once  brought  gold  from  Minas  Gerais  to  Rio 
de  Janeiro  now  carried  coffee  in  quantities  that  swelled  from 
2,304  kilos  in  1792  to  7,761,600  kilos  in  1820,  and  would  reach 
82,178,395  kilos  in  1850. 

Sao  Paulo's  entry  into  the  coffee  age  lay  in  the  future,  but  in 
1821  it  was  providing  herds  of  mules  and  horses  for  the  coffee 
pack  trains.  The  Cisplatine  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  were  ship- 
ping abroad  hides,  tallow,  and  dried  meat.  In  contrast,  the 
Northeast  and  North  were  in  decline  because  an  1815  treaty 
between  Brazil  and  Britain  forbade  the  African  slave  trade 
north  of  the  equator,  thereby  reducing  the  demand  for  Bahian 
molasses-soaked  rolled  tobacco,  and  because  Cuban  competi- 
tion slashed  deeply  into  the  Northeast's  sugar  market  in  the 
United  States  and  Europe.  Even  cotton,  which  a  few  years 
before  seemed  a  secure  export  for  Maranhao,  was  over- 
whelmed by  the  post-War  of  1812  expansion  in  the  southern 
United  States.  The  world  demand  for  Amazonian  nuts,  cocoa, 
skins,  herbs,  spices,  and  rubber  was  still  weak  in  1821.  Finally, 
in  the  Brazilian  west  (Mato  Grosso  and  Goias)  gold  mining  had 
all  but  ended,  and  subsistence  farming  and  livestock  raising 
were  predominant.  Throughout  the  country,  but  more  so  from 
Bahia  through  Minas  Gerais  to  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Sao  Paulo, 
the  labor  force  was  made  up  of  African  or  locally  born  black

slaves.  The  native  heritage  lived  on  in  the  substantial  number 
of  Tupi-speaking  races  and  mixtures  that  lived  in  the  tropical 
forest  region. 

The  Empire,  1822-89 

Emperor  Pedro  1, 1822-31 

Dom  Pedro  meant  to  rule  frugally  and  started  by  cutting  his 
own  salary,  centralizing  scattered  government  offices,  and  sell- 
ing off  most  of  the  royal  horses  and  mules.  He  issued  decrees 
that  eliminated  the  royal  salt  tax  to  spur  output  of  hides  and 
dried  beef,  forbade  arbitrary  seizure  of  private  property, 
required  a  judge's  warrant  for  arrests  of  freemen,  and  banned 
secret  trials,  torture,  and  other  indignities.  He  also  sent  elected 
deputies  to  the  Cortes  in  Portugal.  However,  slaves  continued 
to  be  bought  and  sold  and  disciplined  with  force,  despite  his 
assertion  that  their  blood  was  the  same  color  as  his.  In  Septem- 
ber 1821,  the  Cortes,  with  only  a  portion  of  the  Brazilian  dele- 
gates present,  voted  to  abolish  the  Kingdom  of  Brazil  and  the 
royal  agencies  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  to  make  all  the  provinces 
subordinate  directly  to  Lisbon.  Portugal  sent  troops  to  Brazil 
and  placed  all  Brazilian  units  under  Portuguese  command.  In 
January  1822,  tension  between  Portuguese  troops  and  the 
Luso-Brazilians  (Brazilians  born  in  Portugal)  turned  violent 
when  Pedro  accepted  petitions  from  Brazilian  towns  begging 
him  to  refuse  the  Cortes's  order  to  return  to  Lisbon.  Respond- 
ing to  their  pressure  and  to  the  argument  that  his  departure 
and  the  dismantling  of  the  central  government  would  trigger 
separatist  movements,  he  vowed  to  stay.  The  Portuguese  "lead 
feet,"  as  the  Brazilians  called  the  troops,  rioted  before  concen- 
trating their  forces  on  Cerro  Castello,  which  was  soon  sur- 
rounded by  thousands  of  armed  Brazilians.  Dom  Pedro 
"dismissed"  the  Portuguese  commanding  general  and  ordered 
him  to  remove  his  soldiers  across  the  bay  to  Niteroi,  where  they 
awaited  transport  to  Portugal.  Pedro  formed  a  new  govern- 
ment headed  by  Jose  Bonifacio  de  Andrada  e  Silva  of  Sao 
Paulo.  This  former  royal  official  and  professor  of  science  at 
Coimbra  was  crucial  to  the  subsequent  direction  of  events  and 
is  regarded  as  one  of  the  formative  figures  of  Brazilian  nation- 
alism, indeed,  as  the  patriarch  of  independence. 

The  atmosphere  was  so  charged  that  Dom  Pedro  sought 
assurances  of  asylum  on  a  British  ship  in  case  he  lost  the  loom- 
ing confrontation;  he  also  sent  his  family  to  safety  out  of  the

city.  In  the  following  days,  the  Portuguese  commander  delayed 
embarcation,  hoping  that  expected  reinforcements  would 
arrive.  However,  the  reinforcements  that  arrived  off  Rio  de 
Janeiro  on  March  5,  1822,  were  not  allowed  to  land.  Instead, 
they  were  given  supplies  for  the  voyage  back  to  Portugal.  This 
round  had  been  won  without  bloodshed. 

Blood  had  been  shed  in  Recife  in  the  Province  of  Pernam- 
buco,  when  the  Portuguese  garrison  there  had  been  forced  to 
depart  in  November  1821.  In  mid-February  1822,  Bahians 
revolted  against  the  Portuguese  forces  there  but  were  driven 
into  the  countryside,  where  they  began  guerrilla  operations, 
signaling  that  the  struggle  in  the  north  would  not  be  without 
loss  of  life  and  property.  To  secure  Minas  Gerais  and  Sao  Paulo, 
where  there  were  no  Portuguese  troops  but  where  there  were 
doubts  about  independence,  Dom  Pedro  engaged  in  some 
royal  populism. 

Towns  in  Minas  Gerais  had  expressed  their  loyalty  at  the 
time  of  Pedro's  vow  to  remain,  save  for  the  junta  in  Ouro  Preto, 
the  provincial  capital.  Pedro  realized  that  unless  Minas  Gerais 
were  solidly  with  him,  he  would  be  unable  to  broaden  his 
authority  to  other  provinces.  With  only  a  few  companions  and 
no  ceremony  or  pomp,  Pedro  plunged  into  Minas  Gerais  on 
horseback  in  late  March  1822,  receiving  enthusiastic  welcomes 
and  allegiances  everywhere.  Back  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  on  May  13, 
he  proclaimed  himself  the  "perpetual  defender  of  Brazil"  and 
shortly  thereafter  called  a  Constituent  Assembly  (Assembleia 
Constituinte)  for  the  next  year.  To  deepen  his  base  of  support, 
he  joined  the  freemasons,  who,  led  by  Jose  Bonifacio  Andrada 
e  Silva,  were  pressing  for  parliamentary  government  and  inde- 
pendence. More  confident,  in  early  August  he  called  on  the 
Brazilian  deputies  in  Lisbon  to  return,  decreed  that  Portu- 
guese forces  in  Brazil  should  be  treated  as  enemies,  and  issued 
a  manifesto  to  "friendly  nations."  The  manifeso  read  like  a  dec- 
laration of  independence. 

Seeking  to  duplicate  his  triumph  in  Minas  Gerais,  Pedro 
rode  to  Sao  Paulo  in  August  to  assure  himself  of  support  there 
and  began  a  disastrous  affair  with  Domitila  de  Castro  that 
would  later  weaken  his  government.  Returning  from  an  excur- 
sion to  Santos,  Pedro  received  messages  from  his  wife  and  from 
Andrada  e  Silva  that  the  Cortes  considered  his  government 
traitorous  and  was  dispatching  more  troops.  In  a  famous  scene 
at  Ipiranga  on  September  7,  1822,  he  had  to  choose  between 
returning  to  Portugal  in  disgrace  or  opting  for  independence.

He  tore  the  Portuguese  blue  and  white  insignia  from  his  uni- 
form, drew  his  sword,  and  swore:  "By  my  blood,  by  my  honor, 
and  by  God:  I  will  make  Brazil  free."  Their  motto,  he  said, 
would  be  "Independence  or  Death!" 

Pedro's  government  employed  Admiral  Thomas  Alexander 
Cochrane,  one  of  Britain's  most  successful  naval  commanders 
in  the  Napoleonic  Wars  and  recently  commander  of  the  Chil- 
ean naval  forces  against  Spain.  Pedro's  government  also  hired  a 
number  of  Admiral  Cochrane's  officers  and  French  General 
Pierre  Labatut,  who  had  fought  in  Colombia.  These  men  were 
to  lead  the  fight  to  drive  the  Portuguese  out  of  Bahia,  Mara- 
nhao,  and  Para,  and  to  force  those  areas  to  replace  Lisbon's 
rule  with  that  of  Rio  de  Janeiro.  Money  from  customs  at  Rio  de 
Janeiro's  port  and  local  donations  outfitted  the  army  and  the 
nine-vessel  fleet.  The  use  of  foreign  mercenaries  brought 
needed  military  skills.  The  much-feared  Cochrane  secured 
Maranhao  with  a  single  warship,  despite  the  Portuguese  mili- 
tary's attempt  to  disrupt  the  economy  and  society  with  a 
scorched-earth  campaign  and  with  promises  of  freedom  for  the 
slaves.  By  mid-1823  the  contending  forces  numbered  between 
10,000  and  20,000  Portuguese,  some  of  whom  were  veterans  of 
the  Napoleonic  Wars,  versus  12,000  to  14,000  Brazilians,  mostly 
in  militia  units  from  the  Northeast. 

Some  historians  have  erred  in  supporting  historian  Manuel 
de  Oliveira  Lima's  contention  that  independence  came  with- 
out bloodshed.  In  fact,  although  both  sides  avoided  massive  set 
battles,  they  did  engage  in  guerrilla  tactics,  demonstrations, 
and  countermoves.  There  is  little  information  on  casualties, 
but  the  fighting  provided  a  female  martyr  in  Mother  Joana 
Angelica,  who  was  bayoneted  to  death  by  Portuguese  troops 
invading  her  convent  in  Bahia;  and  an  example  of  female  grit 
in  Maria  Quiteria  de  Jesus,  who,  masquerading  as  a  man, 
joined  the  imperial  army  and  achieved  distinction  in  several 
battles. 

Britain  and  Portugal  recognized  Brazilian  independence  by 
signing  a  treaty  on  August  29,  1825.  Until  then,  the  Brazilians 
feared  that  Portugal  would  resume  its  attack.  Portuguese  retri- 
bution, however,  came  in  a  financial  form.  Secret  codicils  of 
the  treaty  with  Portugal  required  that  Brazil  assume  payment  of 
1.4  million  pounds  sterling  owed  to  Britain  and  indemnify 
Dom  Joao  VI  and  other  Portuguese  for  losses  totaling  600,000 
pounds  sterling.  Brazil  also  renounced  future  annexation  of 
Portuguese  African  colonies,  and  in  a  side  treaty  with  Britain

promised  to  end  the  slave  trade.  Neither  of  these  measures 
pleased  the  slave-holding  planters. 

Organizing  the  new  government  quickly  brought  the  differ- 
ences between  the  emperor  and  his  leading  subjects  to  the 
fore.  In  1824  Pedro  closed  the  Constituent  Assembly  that  he 
had  convened  because  he  believed  that  body  was  endangering 
liberty.  As  assembly  members,  his  advisers,  Jose  Bonifacio  de 
Andrada  e  Silva  and  Dom  Pedro's  brothers,  had  written  a  draft 
constitution  that  would  have  limited  the  monarch  by  making 
him  equal  to  the  legislature  and  judiciary,  similar  to  the  presi- 
dent of  the  United  States.  They  wanted  the  emperor  to  push 
the  draft  through  without  discussion,  which  Pedro  refused  to 
do.  Troops  surrounded  the  assembly  as  he  ordered  it  dissolved. 
He  then  produced  a  constitution  modeled  on  that  of  Portugal 
(1822)  and  France  (1814).  It  specified  indirect  elections  and 
created  the  usual  three  branches  of  government  but  also  added 
a  fourth,  the  moderating  power,  to  be  held  by  the  emperor. 
The  moderating  power  would  give  the  emperor  authority  to 
name  senators  and  judges  and  to  break  deadlocks  by  summon- 
ing and  dismissing  parliaments  and  cabinets.  He  also  had 
treaty-making  and  treaty-ratifying  power.  Pedro's  constitution 
was  more  liberal  than  the  assembly's  in  its  religious  toleration 
and  definition  of  individual  and  property  rights,  but  less  so  in 
its  concentration  of  power  in  the  emperor. 

The  constitution  was  more  acceptable  in  the  flourishing,  cof- 
fee-driven Southeastern  provinces  than  in  the  Northeastern 
sugar  and  cotton  areas,  where  low  export  prices  and  the  high 
cost  of  imported  slaves  were  blamed  on  the  coffee-oriented 
government.  In  mid-1824,  with  Pernambuco  and  Ceara  lead- 
ing, five  Northeastern  provinces  declared  independence  as  the 
Confederation  of  the  Equator,  but  by  year's  end  the  short-lived 
separation  had  been  crushed  by  Admiral  Cochrane.  With  the 
Northeast  pacified,  violence  now  imperiled  the  South. 

In  1825  war  flared  again  over  the  Cisplatine  Province,  this 
time  with  Buenos  Aires  determined  to  annex  the  East  Bank. 
The  empire  could  little  afford  the  troops,  some  of  whom  were 
recruited  in  Ireland  and  Germany,  or  the  sixty  warships  needed 
to  blockade  the  Rio  de  la  Plata.  A  loan  from  London  bankers 
was  expended  by  1826,  and  Pedro  had  to  call  the  General 
Assembly  to  finance  the  war.  The  blockade  raised  objections 
from  the  United  States  and  Britain,  and  reverses  on  land  in 
182V  made  it  necessary  to  negotiate  an  end  to  the  US$30  mil- 
lion Cisplatine  War.  The  war  at  least  left  Uruguay  independent

instead  of  an  Argentine  province.  In  June  1828,  harsh  disci- 
pline and  xenophobia  provoked  a  mutiny  of  mercenary  troops 
in  Rio  de  Janeiro;  the  Irish  were  shipped  home  and  the  Ger- 
mans sent  to  the  South.  The  army  was  reduced  to  15,000  mem- 
bers, and  the  antislavery  Pedro,  now  without  military  muscle, 
faced  a  Parliament  controlled  by  slaveowners  and  their  allies. 

As  coffee  exports  rose  steadily,  so  did  the  numbers  of 
imported  slaves;  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  alone  they  soared  from 
26,254  in  1825  to  43,555  in  1828.  In  1822  about  30  percent,  or 
1  million,  of  Brazil's  population  were  African-born  or 
-descended  slaves.  Slavery  was  so  pervasive  that  beggars  had 
slaves,  and  naval  volunteers  took  theirs  aboard  ship. 

Pedro  had  written  that  slavery  was  a  "cancer  that  is  gnawing 
away  at  Brazil"  and  that  no  one  had  the  right  to  enslave 
another.  He  wanted  to  abolish  slavery,  but  his  own  liberal  con- 
stitution gave  the  law-making  authority  to  the  slavocrat-con- 
trolled  Parliament.  In  Brazil  liberal  principles  and  political 
formulas  were  given  special  meaning.  The  language  of  social 
contract,  popular  sovereignty,  supremacy  of  law,  universal 
rights,  division  of  powers,  and  representative  government  was 
stripped  of  its  revolutionary  content  and  applied  only  to  a 
select,  privileged  minority. 

After  1826  the  slavocrat  agenda  was  to  control  the  court  sys- 
tem; to  provide  harsh  punishments  for  slave  rebellion  but  mild 
ones  for  white  revolt;  to  reduce  the  armed  forces,  cleansing 
them  of  foreigners  unsympathetic  to  slavery;  to  keep  tariffs  low 
and  eliminate  the  Bank  of  Brazil  in  order  to  deny  the  central 
government  the  ability  to  stimulate  a  rival,  finance-based  indus- 
trial capitalism;  and  to  shape  immigration  policy  in  such  a  way 
as  to  encourage  servile  labor  instead  of  independent  farmers 
or  craftsmen.  Led  by  Bernardo  Pereira  de  Vasconcelos  of  Minas 
Gerais  in  the  assembly,  slavocrats  argued  that  slavery  was  not 
demoralizing,  that  foreign  capital  and  technology  would  not 
help  Brazil,  and  that  railroads  would  only  rust.  Others,  such  as 
Nicolau  de  Campos  Vergueiro  of  Sao  Paulo,  argued  in  favor  of 
replacing  slavery  with  free  European  immigrants.  In  the  end, 
the  Parliament  established  a  contract  system  that  was  little  bet- 
ter than  slavery.  There  would  be  no  liberal  empire.  Laws  and 
decrees  unacceptable  to  the  slavocrats  simply  would  not  take 
effect,  such  as  the  order  in  1829  forbidding  slave  ships  to  sail 
for  Africa.  These  items  of  the  slavocrat  agenda  were  the  roots 
of  the  regional  rebellions  of  the  nineteenth  century.

Historical  Setting 


After  Dom  Joao's  death  in  1826,  despite  Pedro's  renuncia- 
tion of  his  right  to  the  Portuguese  throne  in  favor  of  his  daugh- 
ter, Brazilian  nativist  radicals  falsely  accused  the  emperor  of 
plotting  to  overthrow  the  constitution  and  to  proclaim  himself 
the  ruler  of  a  reunited  Brazil  and  Portugal.  They  raised  ten- 
sions by  provoking  street  violence  against  the  Portuguese  of 
Rio  de  Janeiro  and  agitated  for  a  federalist  monarchy  that 
would  give  the  provinces  self-government  and  administrative 
autonomy.  Brazil's  fate  was  in  the  hands  of  a  few  people  con- 
centrated in  the  capital  who  spread  false  stories  and  under- 
mined discipline  in  the  army  and  police.  It  would  not  be  the 
last  time  that  events  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  would  shape  the  future. 
When  Pedro  dismissed  his  cabinet  in  April  1831,  street  and  mil- 
itary demonstrators  demanded  its  reinstatement  in  violation  of 
his  constitutional  prerogatives.  He  refused,  saying:  "I  will  do 
anything  for  the  people  but  nothing  [forced]  by  the  people." 
With  military  units  assembled  on  the  Campo  Santana,  an 
assembly  ground  in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  and  people  in  the  streets 
shouting  "death  to  the  tyrant,"  he  backed  down.  Failing  to  form 
a  new  cabinet,  he  abdicated  in  favor  of  his  five-year-old  son 
Pedro  II,  boarded  a  British  warship,  and  left  Brazil  as  he  had 
arrived,  under  the  Union  Jack. 

The  Regency  Era,  1831-40 

The  three  regents  that  ruled  in  the  young  emperor's  name 
from  1831  to  1840  witnessed  a  period  of  turmoil  as  local  fac- 
tions struggled  to  gain  control  of  their  provinces  and  to  keep 
the  masses  in  line.  Out  of  desperation  to  weaken  the  radical 
appeals  for  federalism,  republicanism,  and  hostility  toward  the 
Portuguese,  and  to  protect  against  contrary  calls  for  Pedro  Fs 
restoration,  the  regency  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  gave  considerable 
power  to  the  provinces  in  1834.  Brazil  took  on  the  appearance 
of  a  federation  of  local  pdtrias  (autonomous  centers  of  regional 
power)  with  loose  allegiance  to  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  government, 
whose  function  was  to  defend  them  from  external  attack  and  to 
maintain  order  and  balance  among  them.  The  government's 
ability  to  carry  out  that  function  was  impaired,  however,  by  the 
low  budgets  allowed  the  army  and  navy,  and  by  the  creation  of 
a  National  Guard,  whose  officers  were  local  notables  deter- 
mined to  protect  their  private  and  regional  interests.  The 
rebellions,  riots,  and  popular  movements  that  marked  the  next 
years  did  not  spring  as  much  from  economic  misery  as  from 


43 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

attempts  to  share  in  the  prosperity  stemming  from  North 
Atlantic  demand  for  Brazil's  exports. 

Many  of  the  disturbances  were  so  fleeting  they  were  all  but 
forgotten.  For  example,  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  alone  there  were  five 
uprisings  in  1831  and  1832.  Another  eight  of  the  more  famous 
revolts  in  the  1834-49  period  included  the  participation  of 
lower-class  people,  Indians,  free  and  runaway  blacks,  and 
slaves,  which  accounts  for  their  often  fierce  suppression. 
Republican  objectives  were  apparent  in  some  of  these  revolts, 
such  as  the  War  of  the  Farrapos  (ragamuffins),  also  known  as 
the  Farroupilha  Rebellion  (1835-45),  in  Santa  Catarina  and 
Rio  Grande  do  Sul.  Others,  such  as  the  Cabanagem  in  Para  in 
1835-37,  the  Sabinada  in  Salvador  in  1837-38,  the  Balaiada 
Rebellion  in  Maranhao  in  1838-41,  and  the  ones  in  Minas 
Gerais  and  Sao  Paulo  in  1842,  were  propelled  simultaneously 
by  antiregency  and  promonarchial  sentiments.  Such  unrest  dis- 
pels the  notion  that  the  history  of  state  formation  in  Brazil  was 
peaceful.  Instead,  it  shows  the  confrontation  between  the 
national  government  and  the  splintering  pdtrias,  which  would 
continue  in  varying  degrees  for  the  next  century. 

Pedro  Fs  death  from  tuberculosis  in  1834  had  sapped  the 
restorationist  impulse  and  removed  the  glue  that  held  uneasy 
political  allies  together.  With  the  regency  attempting  to  sup- 
press simultaneous  revolts  in  the  South  and  North,  it  could  not 
easily  reassert  its  supremacy  over  the  remaining  provinces.  Bra- 
zil could  well  have  split  apart  in  those  years.  It  did  not  for  three 
reasons.  First,  the  military  was  reorganized  as  an  instrument  of 
national  unity  under  the  leadership  of  Luis  Alves  de  Lima  e 
Silva,  who  was  ennobled  as  the  Duke  of  Caxias  (Duque  de  Cax- 
ias)  and  who  would  later  be  proclaimed  Patron  of  the  Brazilian 
Army  Second,  the  specter  of  slave  revolt  and  social  disintegra- 
tion had  become  all  too  real.  And  third,  the  "vision  of  Brazil  as 
a  union  of  autonomous  patrias"  in  Roderick  J.  Barman's 
phrase,  was  replaced  by  the  vision  of  Brazil  as  a  nation-state. 
Rather  than  risk  their  fortunes  and  lives,  the  elites,  longing  for 
a  focus  of  loyalty,  identity,  and  authority,  rallied  around  the 
boy-emperor,  who  ascended  the  throne  on  July  18,  1841,  at  age 
fifteen  instead  of  the  constitutionally  specified  age  of  eighteen. 
Thus,  the  second  empire  was  born  in  the  hope  that  it  would  be 
an  instrument  of  national  unity,  peace,  and  prosperity. 

The  Second  Empire,  1840-89 

In  the  1840s,  the  Brazilian  nation-state  coalesced  as  authori-

ties  suppressed  revolts  and  rewrote  Brazilian  law.  These  laws, 
however,  did  not  bode  well  for  democracy  because  they  shaped 
an  electoral  system  based  on  government-controlled  fraud.  In 
1842,  on  the  advice  of  conservative  courtiers,  Pedro  II  used  his 
constitutional  moderating  power  to  dismiss  the  newly  elected 
liberal  Chamber  of  Deputies  and  called  new  elections,  which 
the  conservatives  won  by  stuffing  the  ballot  boxes.  In  so  doing, 
he  set  a  pattern  of  favoring  conservatives  over  liberals. 

The  constitution  of  1824  had  created  the  usual  three  govern- 
mental powers — executive,  legislative,  and  judicial — and  a 
fourth,  the  moderating  power.  The  emperor  held  this  power, 
which  gave  him  the  right  to  name  senators,  to  dismiss  the  legis- 
lature, and  to  shift  control  of  the  government  from  one  party 
to  the  other.  In  theory,  he  was  to  act  as  the  political  balance 
wheel.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  parties  were  more  groupings 
of  members  of  Parliament  than  ideologically  based  movements 
dependent  on  distinct  electorates.  Historian  Richard  Graham 
observed  that  "No  particular  political  philosophy  distinguished 
one  group  from  another."  Then,  as  now,  the  political  system 
had  an  artificial  aspect  to  it;  it  did  not  relate  openly  to  the  real 
power  structure  of  the  country — the  "lords  of  the  land"  (sen- 
hores  da  terra)  who  ran  local  affairs. 

A  good  example  of  how  the  real  power  holders  manipulated 
the  system  to  protect  their  narrow  interests  to  the  detriment  of 
the  national  interest  was  the  Land  Law  of  1850,  which  set  the 
pattern  for  modern  landholding.  The  Land  Law  ended  the 
colonial  practice  of  obtaining  land  through  squatting  or  royal 
grants  and  limited  acquisition  to  purchase,  thereby  restricting 
the  number  of  people  who  could  become  owners.  By  creating 
obstacles  to  landownership,  the  law's  framers  hoped  to  force 
free  labor  to  work  for  existing  landlords.  However,  proprietors 
sabotaged  the  law  by  not  surveying  their  lands  and  not  resolv- 
ing their  conflicting  claims  in  order  to  keep  titles  cloudy  and 
hence  in  their  hands.  One  result  of  the  uncertain  titles  was  that 
slaves  were  used  as  collateral. 

Also  in  1850,  British  pressure  finally  forced  the  Brazilian  gov- 
ernment to  outlaw  the  African  slave  trade.  London,  tiring  of 
Brazilian  subterfuge,  authorized  its  navy  to  seize  slave  ships  in 
Brazilian  waters,  even  in  ports.  Rather  than  risk  open  war  with 
Britain,  paralyzation  of  commerce,  widespread  slave  unrest, 
and  destabilization  of  the  empire,  the  government  outlawed 
the  African  slave  trade.  It  deported  a  number  of  Portuguese 
slavers  and  instructed  the  provincial  presidents,  police,  judges, 


45 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

and  military  to  crack  down.  Over  the  next  five  years,  even  clan- 
destine landings  stopped,  and  despite  the  tempting  rise  of  slave 
prices  in  the  coffee  districts  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  Province,  the 
trans-Atlantic  trade  ended.  Although  the  British  claimed 
credit,  it  should  be  noted  that  for  the  first  time  a  Brazilian  gov- 
ernment had  the  power  to  enforce  a  law  along  the  length  of 
the  coast.  Also,  internal  support  for  the  trade  had  weakened. 
Most  slave  importers  were  Portuguese,  who  had  been  selling 
the  ever  more  expensive  Africans  to  landowners  on  credit  at 
climbing  interest  rates,  in  some  cases  forcing  the  latter  into 
insolvency  and  loss  of  property.  Xenophobia  and  the  debts  of 
the  landed  classes  combined  to  support  the  government 
action. 

Ending  the  slave  trade  had  a  number  of  consequences.  First, 
because  labor  needs  increased  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Sao  Paulo 
as  the  world  demand  for  coffee  rose,  Northeastern  planters 
sold  their  surplus  slaves  to  Southern  growers.  In  addition,  Par- 
liament passed  laws  encouraging  European  immigration,  as 
well  as  the  Land  Law  of  1850.  Second,  ending  the  slave  trade 
freed  capital  that  could  then  be  used  for  investment  in  trans- 
port and  industrial  enterprises.  Third,  it  ensured  that  Britain 
did  not  interfere  in  Brazil's  military  intervention  to  end  the 
rule  in  Buenos  Aires  of  Juan  Manuel  de  Rosas  (president  of 
Argentina,  1829-33,  1835-52). 

Coffee  dominated  exports  in  the  last  half  of  the  nineteenth 
century,  going  from  50  percent  of  exports  in  1841-50  to  59.5 
percent  in  1871-80.  But  sugar  exports  also  increased,  and  cot- 
ton, tobacco,  cocoa,  rubber,  and  mate  were  important.  The  vast 
cattle  herds  that  grazed  the  Northeastern  sertdo,  the  plains 
(cerrado)  of  Minas  Gerais,  and  the  pampas  of  Rio  Grande  do 
Sul  foreshadowed  Brazil's  status  in  1990  as  the  world's  second 
largest  meat  exporter.  Meat-salting  plants  (saladeros)  in  Rio 
Grande  do  Sul  shipped  sun-dried  beef  to  the  expanding  coffee- 
growing  region  to  feed  its  slaves  and  freed  tenant  farmers 
(colonos).  In  addition  to  beef,  Brazilians  ate  protein-rich  beans, 
rice,  and  corn,  much  of  which  came  from  Minas  Gerais  or  the 
immigrant  colonies  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul.  Interregional  trade 
was  budding,  but  for  the  most  part  local  self-sufficiency  was  the 
norm.  Indeed,  more  people  produced  food  for  the  domestic 
market  than  labored  on  export  crops. 

Expanding  coffee  production  in  the  1850s  and  1860s 
attracted  British  investment  in  railroads  to  speed  transport  of 
the  beans  to  the  coast.  The  Santos-Sao  Paulo  Railroad  (1868)

was  the  first  major  breach  of  the  coastal  escarpment,  which  had 
slowed  development  of  the  Southern  plateau.  Similarly,  in  the 
Northeast  railroads  began  to  cut  into  the  interior  from  the 
coast.  But  generally  the  pattern  was  to  connect  a  port  with  its 
export-oriented  hinterland,  creating  a  series  of  enclaves  that 
were  connected  with  each  other  by  sea.  Well  into  the  twentieth 
century,  Brazil  lacked  railroads  and  highways  linking  its  major 
regions,  urban  areas,  and  economic  zones.  The  country  was 
laced  together  by  intricate  networks  of  mule  trails  that  moved 
goods  and  people  throughout  the  vast  interior.  Viewed  as 
archaic  by  modern  observers,  the  mule  train  trails  nonetheless 
were  important  in  Brazil's  formation,  tying  the  various  regions 
together  and  spreading  a  common  language  and  culture. 

The  empire  had  lost  the  East  Bank  of  the  Rio  de  la  Plata  with 
the  founding  of  Uruguay  in  1828,  but  it  continued  to  meddle 
in  that  republic's  affairs.  Brazil's  most  important  businessman, 
Irineu  Evangelista  de  Sousa,  the  Visconde  de  Maua,  had  such 
heavy  financial  interests  there  that  his  company  was  effectively 
the  Uruguayan  government's  bank.  Other  Brazilians  owned 
about  400  large  estates  (estancias)  that  took  up  nearly  a  third  of 


47

the  country's  territory.  They  objected  to  the  taxes  the  Uruguay- 
ans imposed  when  they  drove  their  cattle  back  and  forth  to  Rio 
Grande  do  Sul,  and  they  took  sides  in  the  constant  fighting 
between  Uruguay's  Colorado  and  Blanco  political  factions, 
which  later  became  the  Colorado  Party  and  the  National  Party 
(Blancos).  Some  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul's  gauchos  did  not  accept 
Uruguayan  independence  in  1828  and  continually  sought 
intervention. 

In  the  mid-1 860s,  the  imperial  government  conspired  with 
Buenos  Aires  authorities  to  replace  the  Blanco  regime  in  Mon- 
tevideo with  a  Colorado  one.  The  Blancos  appealed  to  Para- 
guayan dictator  Francisco  Solano  Lopez  (president,  1862-70), 
who  harbored  his  own  fears  of  the  two  larger  countries  and 
who  regarded  a  threat  to  Uruguay  as  a  menace  to  Paraguay.  A 
small  landlocked  country,  Paraguay  had  the  largest  army  in  the 
region:  64,000  soldiers  compared  with  Brazil's  standing  army  of 
18,000.  In  1864  Brazil  and  Argentina  agreed  to  act  together 
should  Solano  Lopez  attempt  to  save  the  Blancos.  In  Septem- 
ber 1864,  wrongly  convinced  that  he  would  not  be  so  foolish, 
the  Brazilians  sent  troops  into  Uruguay  to  put  the  Colorados  in 
power.  Each  side  miscalculated  the  intentions,  capabilities,  and 
will  of  the  other.  Paraguay  reacted  by  seizing  Brazilian  vessels 
on  the  Rio  Paraguai  and  by  attacking  the  province  of  Mato 
Grosso.  Solano  Lopez,  mistakenly  expecting  help  from  anti- 
Buenos  Aires  caudillos,  sent  his  forces  into  Corrientes  to  get  at 
Rio  Grande  do  Sul  and  Uruguay  and  found  himself  at  war  with 
both  Argentina  and  Brazil.  In  May  1865,  those  two  countries 
and  Colorado-led  Uruguay  signed  an  alliance  that  aimed  to 
transfer  contested  Paraguayan  territory  to  the  larger  countries, 
to  open  Paraguayan  rivers  to  international  trade,  and  to 
remove  Solano  Lopez.  By  September  1865,  the  allies  had 
driven  the  Paraguayans  out  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  and  they 
took  the  war  into  Paraguay  when  that  country  spurned  their 
peace  overtures. 

Fiercely  defending  their  homeland,  the  Guarani-speaking 
Paraguayans  defeated  the  allies  at  Curupaiti  in  September 
1866.  The  Argentine  president,  General  Bartolome  Mitre 
(1861-68),  took  the  bulk  of  his  troops  home  to  quell  opposi- 
tion to  his  war  policy,  leaving  the  Brazilians  to  soldier  on.  The 
famed  General  Lima  e  Silva,  Marquis  and  later  Duke  of  Caxias, 
took  command  of  the  allied  forces  and  led  them  until  the  fall 
of  Asuncion  in  early  1869.  With  stubborn  determination,  the 


48 


Historical  Setting 


Brazilians  pursued  Solano  Lopez  until  they  cornered  and  killed 
him.  They  then  occupied  Paraguay  until  1878. 

The  war  dragged  on  for  several  reasons.  First,  the  Paraguay- 
ans were  better  prepared  at  the  outset  and  conducted  an  effec- 
tive offensive  into  the  territories  of  their  adversaries, 
immediately  handing  them  defeats.  Even  later,  when  pushed 
back  onto  their  own  land,  they  had  the  advantages  of  knowing 
the  ground,  of  having  prepared  defenses,  and  of  fielding  stub- 
bornly loyal  troops.  Second,  it  took  the  Brazilians  considerable 
time  to  marshal  their  forces  and  considerable  effort  and  cost  to 
keep  them  supplied.  Third,  the  Argentines,  hoping  to  improve 
their  postwar  situation  in  relation  to  Brazil,  delayed  operations 
partly  to  force  the  empire  to  weaken  itself  by  expending  its 
resources.  Fourth,  this  was  the  era  of  "unconditional  surren- 
der." It  was  militarily  fashionable  to  pursue  Solano  Lopez  to  the 
bitter  end. 

The  war  had  important  consequences  for  Brazil  and  the  Rio 
de  la  Plata  region.  It  left  Brazil  and  Argentina  facing  each  other 
over  a  prostrate  Paraguay  and  a  dependent  Uruguay,  a  situa- 
tion that  would  soon  turn  into  a  tense  rivalry  that  repeatedly 
assumed  warlike  postures.  Historians  debate  the  number  of 
Paraguayan  casualties,  some  asserting  that  50  percent  of  Para- 
guayans were  killed,  others  arguing  that  it  was  much  less,  possi- 
bly 8  to  9  percent  of  the  prewar  population  total.  Nonetheless, 
the  losses  from  battle,  disease,  and  starvation  were  severe  and 
disrupted  the  development  of  the  republic.  In  Brazil  the  war 
contributed  to  the  growth  of  manufacturing,  to  the  profession- 
alization  of  the  armed  forces  and  their  concentration  in  Rio 
Grande  do  Sul,  to  the  building  of  roads  and  the  settling  of 
European  immigrants  in  the  southern  provinces,  and  to  the 
increased  power  of  the  central  government.  Most  important 
for  the  future,  the  war  brought  the  military  firmly  into  the 
political  arena.  Military  officers  were  keenly  aware  that  the  war 
had  exposed  the  military's  lack  of  equipment,  training,  and 
organization.  Officers  blamed  these  shortcomings  on  civilian 
officials.  In  the  next  decades,  reformist  officers  seeking  to 
modernize  the  army  would  criticize  the  Brazilian  political 
structure  and  its  peculiar  culture  as  obstacles  to  moderniza- 
tion. 

The  end  of  the  war  coincided  with  the  resurgence  of  republi- 
canism as  disenchanted  liberals  cast  about  for  a  new  route  to 
power.  The  1867  collapse  of  the  short-lived,  French-sponsored 
Mexican  monarchy  of  Maximilian  left  Brazil  as  the  hemi- 


49

sphere's  only  monarchial  regime.  And  because  Argentina 
appeared  to  prosper  in  the  1870s  and  1880s,  it  served  as  a  pow- 
erful advertisement  for  republican  government.  The  republi- 
can ideology  spread  in  urban  areas  and  in  provinces,  such  as 
Sao  Paulo  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  where  the  people  did  not 
believe  they  benefited  from  imperial  economic  policies.  The 
republican  manifesto  of  1870  proclaimed  that  "We  are  in 
America  and  we  want  to  be  Americans."  Monarchy  was,  the 
writers  asserted,  hostile  to  the  interests  of  the  American  states 
and  would  be  a  continuous  source  of  conflict  with  Brazil's 
neighbors.  The  republicans  embraced  the  abolition  of  slavery 
to  remove  the  stigma  of  Brazil's  being  the  only  remaining  slave- 
holding  country  (save  for  Spanish  Cuba)  in  the  hemisphere.  It 
was  not  so  much  that  they  believed  that  slavery  was  wrong  as 
that  it  gave  the  country  an  image  distasteful  to  Europeans.  Abo- 
lition, which  would  come  in  1888,  did  not  imply  that  liberals 
wanted  deep  social  reform  or  desired  a  democratic  society. 
Indeed,  their  arguments  against  slavery  were  weighted  toward 
efficiency  rather  than  morality.  Once  in  power,  the  republicans 
looked  to  discipline  the  legally  free  work  force  with  various  sys- 
tems of  social  control. 

The  Brazilian  social  system  functioned  through  intertwined 
networks  of  patronage,  familial  relationships,  and  friendships. 
The  state,  capitalist  economy,  and  institutions  such  as  the 
church  and  the  army  developed  within  what  historian  Emilia 
Viotti  da  Costa  has  called,  "the  web  of  patronage."  Contacts 
and  favor  rather  than  ability  determined  success  in  virtually  all 
occupations.  Brazilian  society  was,  and  still  is,  one  in  which  a 
person  could  not  advance  without  friends  and  family;  hence, 
the  continued  importance  of  kinship  networks  (parentelas) , 
godfathers  (compadres)  and  godmothers  (comadres),  and  mili- 
tary school  classes  (turmas).  Such  a  social  system  did  not  lend 
itself  to  reform. 

The  1870s  and  1880s  saw  a  crisis  in  each  of  the  three  pillars 
of  the  imperial  regime — the  church,  the  military,  and  the  slave- 
holding  system.  Together,  these  crises  represented  the  failure 
of  the  regime  to  adapt  without  alienating  its  base.  In  the  1870s, 
Rome  pressured  Brazil's  Roman  Catholic  Church  to  conform 
to  the  conservative  reforms  of  Vatican  Council  I,  which 
strengthened  the  power  of  the  pontiff  by  declaring  him  infalli- 
ble in  matters  of  faith  and  morals.  This  effort  by  Rome  to  unify 
doctrine  and  practice  worldwide  conflicted  with  royal  control 
of  the  church  in  Brazil.  The  crown  had  inherited  the  padroado, 


50

or  right  of  ecclesiastical  patronage,  from  its  Portuguese  prede- 
cessor. This  right  gave  the  crown  control  over  the  church, 
which  imperial  authorities  treated  as  an  arm  of  the  state. 
Although  some  clerics  had  displayed  republican  sentiments 
earlier  in  the  century,  a  church-state  crisis  exploded  in  the  mid- 
18708  over  efforts  to  Europeanize  the  church. 

The  importance  of  the  military  crisis  is  clearer  because  it 
removed  the  armed  prop  of  the  regime.  After  the  Paraguayan 
War  (1864-70),  the  monarchy  was  indifferent  to  the  army, 
which  the  civilian  elite  did  not  perceive  as  a  threat.  The  fiscal 
problems  of  the  1870s  slowed  promotions  to  a  crawl,  salaries 
were  frozen,  and  officers  complained  about  having  to  contrib- 
ute to  a  widows'  fund  from  their  meager  salaries.  Moreover,  the 
soldiers  in  the  ranks  were  considered  the  dregs  of  society,  disci- 
pline was  based  on  the  lash,  and  training  seemed  pointless. 
The  gulf  between  the  military  and  the  civilian  oligarchies 
broadened.  The  political  parties  were  as  indifferent  as  the  gov- 
ernment to  demands  for  military  reform,  for  obligatory  mili- 
tary service,  for  better  armament,  and  for  higher  pay  and 
status.  During  the  1870s,  the  discontent  was  checked  by  the 
National  Guard's  reduced  role;  by  an  unsuccessful  but  wel- 
comed attempt  to  improve  the  recruitment  system;  and,  espe- 
cially, by  the  cabinet  service  of  war  heroes,  including  the  Duke 
of  Caxias  as  prime  minister  (1875-78)  and  Marshal  Manuel 
Luis  Osorio,  the  Marquis  of  Herval,  as  minister  of  war  (1878). 
But  the  latter  died  in  1879  and  Caxias  the  year  after,  leaving 
leadership  to  officers  less  committed  to  the  throne.  The  junior 
officer  ranks  were  filled  with  men  from  the  middle  sectors  who 
had  entered  the  army  to  obtain  an  education  rather  than  to  fol- 
low a  military  career.  They  were  more  concerned  than  their 
predecessors  with  social  changes  that  would  open  opportuni- 
ties to  the  lower  middle  class. 

The  officer  corps  was  split  into  three  generations.  The  oldest 
group  had  helped  suppress  the  regional  revolts  of  the  1830s 
and  1840s,  had  fought  in  Argentina  in  1852,  and  had  survived 
the  Paraguayan  War.  The  numerous  mid-level  officers  were  bet- 
ter schooled  than  their  seniors  and  had  been  tested  in  combat 
in  Paraguay.  The  junior  officers  had  missed  the  war  but  had  the 
most  education  of  the  three  groups  and  had  experienced  the 
empire  only  when  its  defects  had  become  clearly  apparent. 
They  were  the  least  attached  to  the  old  regime  and  the  most 
frustrated  by  the  lack  of  advancement  in  a  peacetime  army  clut- 
tered with  veterans  of  the  great  war.

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Brazilian  political  tradition  permitted  officers  to  hold  politi- 
cal office  and  to  serve  as  cabinet  ministers,  thereby  blurring 
the  civil-military  roles.  As  parliamentary  deputies  and  senators, 
officers  could  criticize  the  government,  including  their  military 
superiors,  with  impunity.  In  the  1880s,  officers  participated  in 
provincial  politics,  debated  in  the  press,  and  spoke  in  public 
forums.  In  1884  a  civilian  minister  of  war  attempted  to  impose 
order  by  forbidding  officers  to  write  or  speak  publicly  about 
governmental  matters.  The  subsequent  punishments  of  offend- 
ing officers  led  Field  Marshal  Manuel  Deodoro  da  Fonseca  and 
General  Jose  Antonio  Correia  de  Camara  (Visconde  de  Pelo- 
tas)  to  head  protests  that  eventually  forced  the  minister  to 
resign  in  February  1887  and  the  cabinet  to  fall  in  March  1888. 

Even  as  the  church  and  military  crises  were  unfolding,  the 
slavery  issue  shook  the  support  of  the  landed  elite.  Members  of 
the  Liberal  and  Conservative  Parties  came  from  the  same  social 
groups:  plantation  owners  (fazendeiros)  made  up  half  of  both, 
and  the  rest  were  bureaucrats  and  professionals.  The  ideologi- 
cal differences  between  the  parties  were  trivial,  but  factional 
and  personal  rivalries  within  them  made  it  difficult  for  the  par- 
ties to  adjust  to  changing  social  and  economic  circumstances. 
As  a  result,  the  last  decade  of  the  empire  was  marked  by  consid- 
erable political  instability.  Between  1880  and  1889,  there  were 
ten  cabinets  (seven  in  the  first  five  years)  and  three  parliamen- 
tary elections,  with  no  Parliament  able  to  complete  its  term. 
The  repeated  use  of  the  moderating  power  provoked  alien- 
ation, even  among  traditional  monarchists. 

Attitudes  toward  slavery  had  shifted  gradually.  Pedro  II 
favored  abolition,  and  during  the  Paraguayan  War  slaves  serv- 
ing in  the  military  were  emancipated.  In  1871  the  Rio  Branco 
cabinet  approved  a  law  freeing  newborns  and  requiring  mas- 
ters to  care  for  them  until  age  eight,  at  which  time  they  would 
either  be  turned  over  to  the  government  for  compensation  or 
the  owner  would  have  use  of  their  labor  until  age  twenty-one. 
In  1884  a  law  freed  slaves  over  sixty  years  of  age.  By  the  1880s, 
the  geography  of  slavery  had  also  changed,  and  the  economy 
was  less  dependent  on  it.  Because  of  manumissions  (many  on 
condition  of  remaining  on  the  plantations)  and  the  massive 
flight  of  slaves,  the  overall  numbers  declined  from  1,240,806  in 
1884  to  723,419  in  1887,  with  most  slaves  having  shifted  from 
the  sugar  plantations  in  the  Northeast  to  the  south-central  cof- 
fee groves.  But  even  planters  in  Sao  Paulo,  where  the  slave  per- 
centage of  the  total  population  had  fallen  from  28.2  percent  in 


52 


Historical  Setting 


1854  to  8.7  percent  in  1886,  understood  that  to  continue 
expansion  they  needed  a  different  labor  system.  The  provincial 
government  therefore  actively  began  subsidizing  and  recruit- 
ing immigrants.  Between  1875  and  1887,  about  156,000  arrived 
in  Sao  Paulo.  Meanwhile,  the  demand  for  cheap  sugarcane 
workers  in  the  Northeast  was  satisfied  by  sertanejos  (inhabitants 
of  the  sertdo)  fleeing  the  devastating  droughts  of  the  1870s  in 
the  sertdo. 

The  economic  picture  was  also  changing.  Slavery  immobi- 
lized capital  invested  in  the  purchase  and  maintenance  of 
slaves.  By  turning  to  free  labor,  planter  capital  was  freed  for 
investment  in  railroads,  streetcar  lines,  and  shipping  and  man- 
ufacturing enterprises.  To  some  extent,  these  investments 
offered  a  degree  of  protection  from  the  caprices  of  agriculture. 

Meanwhile,  slaves  left  the  plantations  in  great  numbers,  and 
an  active  underground  supported  runaways.  Army  officers  peti- 
tioned the  Regent  Princess  Isabel  to  relieve  them  of  the  duty  of 
pursuing  runaway  slaves.  Field  Marshal  Deodoro  da  Fonseca, 
commander  in  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  declared  in  early  1887  that 
the  military  "had  the  obligation  to  be  abolitionist."  The  Sao 
Paulo  assembly  petitioned  the  Parliament  for  immediate  aboli- 
tion. The  agitation  reached  such  a  pitch  that  to  foreign  travel- 
ers, Brazil  appeared  on  the  verge  of  social  revolution.  The 
system  was  coming  apart,  and  even  planters  realized  that  aboli- 
tion was  the  way  to  prevent  chaos. 

The  so-called  Golden  Law  of  May  13,  1888,  which  ended  sla- 
very, was  not  an  act  of  great  bravery  but  a  recognition  that  sla- 
very was  no  longer  viable.  The  economy  revived  rapidly  after  a 
few  lost  harvests,  and  only  a  small  number  of  planters  went 
bankrupt.  Slavery  ended,  but  the  plantation  survived  and  so 
did  the  basic  attitudes  of  a  class  society.  The  abolitionists 
quickly  abandoned  those  they  had  struggled  to  free.  Many 
former  slaves  stayed  on  the  plantations  in  the  same  quarters, 
receiving  paltry  wages.  They  were  joined  by  waves  of  immi- 
grants, who  often  found  conditions  so  unbearable  that  they 
soon  moved  to  the  cities  or  returned  to  Europe.  No  freedmen's 
bureaus  or  schools  were  established  to  improve  the  lives  of  the 
former  slaves;  they  were  left  at  the  bottom  of  the  socioeco- 
nomic scale,  where  their  descendants  remain  in  the  1990s.  New 
prisons  built  after  1888  were  soon  filled  with  former  slaves  as 
society  imposed  other  forms  of  social  control,  in  part  by  rede- 
fining crime.

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

In  the  end,  the  empire  fell  because  the  elites  did  not  need  it 
to  protect  their  interests.  Indeed,  imperial  centralization  ran 
counter  to  their  desires  for  local  autonomy.  The  republicans 
embraced  federalism,  which  some  saw  as  a  way  to  counter  the 
oligarchies,  which  used  patronage  and  clientage  to  stay  in 
power.  In  the  early  republic,  however,  they  would  find  that  the 
oligarchies  adapted  easily  and  used  their  accumulated  power 
and  skills  to  control  the  new  governmental  system.  Taking 
advantage  of  cabinet  crises  in  1888  and  1889  and  of  rising  frus- 
tration among  military  officers,  republicans  favoring  change  by 
revolution  rather  than  by  evolution  drew  military  officers,  led 
by  Field  Marshal  Fonseca,  into  a  conspiracy  to  replace  the  cabi- 
net in  November  1889.  What  started  as  an  armed  demonstra- 
tion demanding  replacement  of  a  cabinet  turned  within  hours 
into  a  coup  d'etat  deposing  Emperor  Pedro  II. 

The  Republican  Era,  1889-1985 

The  history  of  the  republic  has  been  a  search  for  a  viable 
form  of  government  to  replace  the  monarchy.  That  search  has 
lurched  back  and  forth  between  state  autonomy  and  centraliza- 
tion. The  constitution  of  1891,  establishing  the  United  States  of 
Brazil  (Estados  Unidos  do  Brasil),  restored  autonomy  to  the 
provinces,  now  called  states.  It  recognized  that  the  central  gov- 
ernment did  not  rule  at  the  local  level,  that  it  exercised  control 
only  through  the  local  oligarchies.  The  empire  had  not 
absorbed  fully  the  regional  pdtrias,  and  now  they  reasserted 
themselves.  Into  the  1920s,  the  federal  government  in  Rio  de 
Janeiro  would  be  dominated  and  managed  by  a  combination  of 
the  more  powerful  pdtrias  (Sao  Paulo,  Minas  Gerais,  Rio 
Grande  do  Sul,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  Pernambuco  and  Bahia). 
After  the  revolution  of  1930,  the  trend  would  be  strongly 
toward  absorption  of  the  pdtrias,  reaching  a  peak  in  the  New 
State  (Estado  Novo)  of  1937-45.  Centralization  extended  into 
the  smallest  remote  villages  as  the  nation-state's  bureaucracy 
and  power  grew  to  previously  unknown  levels.  Renewed  auton- 
omy would  come  with  the  constitution  of  1946  but  would  disap- 
pear under  the  military  regime.  The  constitution  of  1988  once 
again  restored  a  degree  of  state  autonomy  but  in  the  context  of 
a  powerful,  all-embracing  nation-state.  In  the  1990s,  the  pdtrias 
are  more  folkloric  vestiges  than  autonomous  centers  of  power. 

The  history  of  the  republic  is  also  the  story  of  the  develop- 
ment of  the  army  as  a  national  institution.  The  elimination  of 
the  monarchy  had  reduced  the  number  of  national  institutions 


54 


Historical  Setting 


to  one,  the  army.  Although  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  con- 
tinued its  presence  throughout  the  country,  it  was  not  national 
but  rather  international  in  its  personnel,  doctrine,  liturgy,  and 
purposes.  By  the  time  of  the  1964  coup,  the  political  parties 
were  not  national  parties;  they  were  oriented  more  along 
regional,  personalist  (personalism — see  Glossary),  and  special- 
interest  lines.  Only  in  the  struggle  to  reestablish  civilian  rule  in 
the  1980s  did  a  fitful  process  of  creating  national  parties  take 
shape.  Thus,  the  army  was  the  core  of  the  developing  Brazilian 
state,  a  marked  change  from  the  marginal  role  that  it  had 
played  during  the  empire.  The  army  assumed  this  new  position 
almost  haphazardly,  filling  part  of  the  vacuum  left  by  the  col- 
lapse of  the  monarchy  and  gradually  acquiring  a  doctrine  and 
vision  to  support  its  de  facto  role.  Although  it  had  more  units 
and  men  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  than  else- 
where, its  presence  was  felt  throughout  the  country.  Its  person- 
nel, its  interests,  its  ideology,  and  its  commitments  were 
national  in  scope  (see  The  Military  Role  in  Society  and  Govern- 
ment, ch.  5). 

The  republic's  first  decade  was  one  of  turmoil.  It  appears  to 
be  a  pattern  of  Brazilian  history  that  seemingly  peaceful 
regime  changes  are  followed  by  long  periods  of  adjustment, 
often  scarred  by  violence.  Years  of  "regime  change"  in  1889, 
1930,  and  1964  introduced  protracted  adjustment  that 
involved  some  authoritarian  rule.  Curiously,  because  the  vio- 
lence occurred  over  long  periods,  usually  without  overturning 
the  government  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  or  Brasilia,  Brazil  acquired 
an  undeserved  reputation  for  having  a  nonviolent  history  of 
political  and  social  compromise. 

The  Old  or  First  Republic,  1 889-1 930 

The  founders  of  the  Brazilian  republic  faced  a  serious  ques- 
tion of  legitimacy.  How  could  an  illegal,  treasonous  act  estab- 
lish a  legal  political  order?  The  officers  who  joined  Field 
Marshal  Deodoro  da  Fonseca  in  ending  the  empire  were  violat- 
ing solemn  oaths  to  uphold  emperor  and  empire.  The  officer 
corps  would  eventually  resolve  the  contradiction  by  linking  its 
duty  and  destiny  to  Brazil,  the  motherland,  rather  than  to  tran- 
sitory governments.  In  addition,  the  republic  was  born  rather 
accidentally:  Deodoro  had  intended  only  to  replace  the  cabi- 
net, but  the  republicans  manipulated  him  into  fathering  a 
republic. 


55 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

The  Brazilian  republic  was  not  a  spiritual  offspring  of  the 
republics  born  of  the  French  or  American  revolutions,  even 
though  the  Brazilian  regime  would  attempt  to  associate  itself 
with  both.  The  republic  did  not  have  enough  popular  support 
to  risk  open  elections.  It  was  a  regime  born  of  a  coup  d'etat  that 
maintained  itself  by  force.  The  republicans  made  Deodoro 
president  (1889-91)  and,  after  a  financial  crisis,  appointed 
Field  Marshal  Floriano  Vieira  Peixoto  minister  of  war  to  ensure 
the  allegiance  of  the  military.  Indeed,  the  Brazilian  people 
were  bystanders  to  the  events  shaping  their  history.  In  the  last 
decades  of  the  nineteenth  century,  the  United  States,  much  of 
Europe,  and  neighboring  Argentina  expanded  the  right  to 
vote.  Brazil,  however,  moved  to  restrict  access  to  the  polls.  In 
1874,  in  a  population  of  about  10  million,  the  franchise  was 
held  by  about  1  million,  but  in  1881  this  had  been  cut  to 
145,296.  This  reduction  was  one  reason  the  empire's  legitimacy 
foundered,  but  the  republic  did  not  move  to  correct  the  situa- 
tion. By  1910  there  were  only  627,000  voters  in  a  population  of 
22  million.  Throughout  the  1920s,  only  between  2.3  percent 
and  3.4  percent  of  the  total  population  voted. 

The  instability  and  violence  of  the  1890s  were  related  to  the 
absence  of  consensus  among  the  elites  regarding  a  governmen- 
tal model;  and  the  armed  forces  were  divided  over  their  status, 
relationship  to  the  political  regime,  and  institutional  goals. 
The  lack  of  military  unity  and  the  disagreement  among  civilian 
elites  about  the  military's  role  in  society  explain  partially  why  a 
long-term  military  dictatorship  was  not  established,  as  some 
officers  advocating  positivism  (see  Glossary)  wanted.  However, 
military  men  were  very  active  in  politics;  early  in  the  decade, 
ten  of  the  twenty  state  governors  were  officers. 

The  Constituent  Assembly  that  drew  up  the  constitution  of 
1891  was  a  battleground  between  those  seeking  to  limit  execu- 
tive power,  which  was  dictatorial  under  President  Deodoro  da 
Fonseca,  and  the  Jacobins,  radical  authoritarians  who  opposed 
the  Paulista  coffee  oligarchy  and  who  wanted  to  preserve  and 
intensify  presidential  authority.  The  new  charter  established  a 
federation  governed  supposedly  by  a  president,  a  bicameral 
National  Congress  (Congresso  Nacional;  hereafter,  Congress), 
and  a  judiciary.  However,  real  power  was  in  the  regional  pdtrias 
and  in  the  hands  of  local  potentates,  called  "colonels"  ( coronets', 
coronelismo — see  Glossary).  Thus,  the  constitutional  system  did 
not  work  as  that  document  had  envisaged.  It  would  take  until 
the  end  of  the  decade  for  an  informal  but  real  distribution  of 


56 


Historical  Setting 


power,  the  so-called  politics  of  the  governors,  to  take  shape  as 
the  result  of  armed  struggles  and  bargaining. 

Article  14  on  the  military  was  particularly  important  for  the 
future.  It  declared  the  army  and  navy  to  be  permanent  national 
institutions  responsible  for  maintaining  law  and  order  and  for 
ensuring  the  continuance  of  the  three  constitutional  powers. 
Officers  insisted  on  the  statement  of  permanent  status  because 
they  feared  that  the  elites  would  disband  their  services.  The 
armed  forces  were  to  be  the  moderator  of  the  system,  and  mili- 
tary officers  were  Brazil's  only  constitutionally  mandated  elite. 
The  article  also  required  the  military  to  be  obedient  to  the 
president  but  "within  the  limits  of  the  law."  Thus,  the  armed 
forces  were  to  obey  only  if  they  determined  a  presidential 
order  to  be  legal.  Oddly,  military  officials  were  less  than  enthu- 
siastic about  discretionary  obedience,  which  they  saw  as  subver- 
sive; the  civilian  politicians,  however,  wanted  it  as  a  check  on 
presidential  power.  Interestingly,  the  constitutions  of  1934  and 
1946  kept  the  discretionary  clause  unaltered.  However,  the 
1937  constitution  of  the  dictatorial  Estado  Novo,  which  was  a 
military  regime  in  civilian  dress,  put  the  military  securely 
under  obedience  to  the  president. 

In  the  election  that  followed  the  adoption  of  the  new  consti- 
tution in  1891,  Deodoro  da  Fonseca  and  Floriano  Peixoto  were 
elected  president  and  vice  president,  respectively,  but  with  the 
former  gaining  only  129  votes  and  the  latter  153.  The  first  pres- 
ident, Deodoro  da  Fonseca,  had  difficulty  adjusting  to  sharing 
power  with  Congress  and,  in  imperial  fashion,  dissolved  it  in 
November  1891,  provoking  rebellions  in  the  navy  and  in  Rio 
Grande  do  Sul.  To  mollify  the  opposition,  he  resigned  in  favor 
of  Vice  President  Peixoto  (acting  president,  1891-94).  Peixoto, 
known  as  the  "Iron  Marshal"  (marechal  de ferro),  ousted  all  the 
state  governors  who  had  supported  Deodoro,  provoking  vio- 
lence in  many  parts  of  the  country.  One  of  the  bloodiest  of 
these  struggles  was  the  civil  war  that  exploded  in  Rio  Grande 
do  Sul  in  1893  and  soon  spread  into  Santa  Catarina  and 
Parana,  pitting  former  monarchist  liberals  against  republicans. 
Concurrently,  the  fleet  in  Guanabara  Bay  at  Rio  de  Janeiro 
challenged  Peixoto,  and  the  naval  revolt  quickly  became  linked 
to  the  struggle  in  the  South.  Peixoto's  diplomat  in  Washington, 
Salvador  de  Mendonca,  with  the  help  of  New  York  businessman 
Charles  Flint,  was  able  to  assemble  a  squadron  of  ships  with 
American  crews,  which  proved  decisive  in  ending  the  standoff 
in  Guanabara  Bay.  The  United  States  government,  interested

in  Brazilian  commerce  and  in  the  republic's  survival,  permitted 
this  mercenary  effort  to  occur  and  sent  several  cruisers  to  pro- 
vide a  barely  concealed  escort.  This  was  the  first  documented 
American  intervention  in  Brazil's  internal  affairs,  and  signifi- 
cantly it  was  organized  privately. 

Deodoro  da  Fonseca's  dissolution  of  Congress,  his  resigna- 
tion, Peixoto's  assumption  of  power,  and  the  outbreak  of  civil 
war  split  the  officer  corps  and  led  to  the  arrest  and  expulsion 
of  several  senior  officers.  Although  the  power  struggles  that 
produced  the  fighting  in  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  during  1893-95 
were  local  in  origin,  Peixoto  made  them  national  by  siding  with 
republican  Governor  Julio  de  Gastilhos.  The  savage  combat 
and  the  execution  of  prisoners  and  suspected  sympathizers,  in 
what  historian  Jose  Maria  Bello  called  the  "crudest  of  Brazil's 
civil  wars,"  was  shameful  on  both  sides.  Peixoto's  fierce  defense 
of  the  republic  made  him  the  darling  of  the  Jacobins  and  from 
then  on  a  symbol  of  Brazilian  nationalism.  In  November  1894, 
because  of  his  ill  health  (he  died  in  1895)  and  the  military's  dis- 
unity, Peixoto  turned  the  government  over  to  a  spokesman  for 
the  agrarian  coffee  elite,  Sao  Paulo  native  Prudente  Jose  de 
Morais  Barros,  also  known  as  Prudente  de  Morais,  the  first  civil- 
ian president  (1894-98).  Prudente  de  Morais  negotiated  an 
end  to  the  war  in  the  South  and  granted  amnesty  to  the  rebels 
and  the  expelled  officers.  He  weakened  the  army's  staunchest 
republicans  and  sought  to  lower  the  military's  political  weight. 
He  promoted  officers  committed  to  creating  a  professional 
force  that  would  be  at  the  disposal  of  the  national  authorities, 
who  would  determine  how  it  was  to  be  employed.  A  General 
Staff  (Estado  Geral),  established  in  1896  on  the  German 
model,  was  to  shape  this  new  army. 

However,  before  the  new  army  could  take  shape,  it  was  used 
in  1897  to  destroy  the  religious  community  of  Canudos  in  the 
sertdo  of  Bahia,  which  the  Jacobins  thought  mistakenly  was  a 
hot-bed  of  monarchist  sedition.  The  Rio  de  Janeiro  govern- 
ment, which  saw  monarchists  everywhere,  threw  a  force  of 
9,500  against  a  population  of  perhaps  30,000.  Some  4,193  sol- 
diers were  wounded  between  July  and  October  1897,  and  the 
townspeople  were  killed,  taken  prisoner,  or  fled.  Canudos  was 
erased  in  the  same  fashion  that  Indian  villages  had  been  and 
continued  to  be  erased.  Although  the  campaign's  symbolic 
value  as  a  defense  of  the  republic  faded  as  the  reality  became 
known,  it  remained  a  powerful  warning  to  marginal  (marginal- 
ity — see  Glossary)  folk  throughout  Brazil  that  they  would  not

be  permitted  to  challenge  the  hierarchical  order  of  society.  In 
this  sense,  Canudos  was  a  step  in  creating  mechanisms  of  social 
control  in  the  postslavery  era. 

Canudos  affected  the  political  scene  immediately  when  a 
returning  soldier,  the  foil  in  a  high-level  Jacobin  conspiracy, 
attempted  to  assassinate  President  Prudente  de  Morais  but 
killed  the  minister  of  war  instead,  thereby  acting  as  a  catalyst 
for  rallying  support  for  the  government.  The  abortive  assassina- 
tion made  possible  the  election  of  Manuel  Ferraz  de  Campos 
Sales  (president,  1898-1902).  In  the  army,  the  attempt  consoli- 
dated the  hold  of  generals  who  opposed  Floriano  Peixoto  and 
were  interested  in  professionalizing  the  institution. 

The  turmoil  of  the  1890s  and  particularly  Canudos  sus- 
pended the  military's  capability  to  exercise  the  moderating 
role  that  it  supposedly  inherited  from  the  monarchy.  By  1898 
the  rural-based  regional  oligarchies  had  regained  command  of 
the  political  system.  Their  fiscal  policies  reflected  their  belief 
that  Brazil  was  an  agricultural  country  whose  strength  was  in 
supplying  Europe  and  North  America  with  coffee,  rubber, 
sugar,  tobacco,  and  many  natural  resources.  Brazil  produced  75 
percent  of  the  world's  coffee.  With  competition  increasing, 
however,  prices  fell  continually,  causing  the  government  to 


59

devalue  the  currency  against  the  British  pound.  This  devalua- 
tion forced  up  the  price  of  imported  goods,  thus  lowering  con- 
sumption and  government  tax  revenues  from  imports.  Those 
shortfalls  led  to  suspension  of  payments  on  the  foreign  debt, 
and  the  generally  poor  economy  caused  half  of  the  banks  to 
collapse.  The  oligarchy  responded  to  the  situation  by  attempt- 
ing to  preserve  its  own  position  and  by  limiting  national  indus- 
try and  infrastructure  to  that  necessary  to  support  the 
agricultural  economy.  The  society  that  the  economy  underlay 
was  one  in  which  the  elites  regarded  the  majority  of  the  people 
merely  as  cheap  labor.  The  elites  encouraged  immigration  to 
keep  labor  plentiful  and  inexpensive,  although  they  also 
wanted  to  "whiten"  the  population.  They  considered  public 
education  of  little  use  and  potentially  subversive. 

The  political  system  that  took  shape  at  the  beginning  of  the 
twentieth  century  had  apparent  and  real  aspects.  There  was  the 
constitutional  system,  and  there  was  the  real  system  of  unwrit- 
ten agreements  (coronelismd)  among  local  bosses,  the  colonels. 
Coronelismo,  which  supported  state  autonomy,  was  called  the 
"politics  of  the  governors."  Under  it,  the  local  oligarchies  chose 
the  state  governors,  who  in  turn  selected  the  president. 

The  populous  and  prosperous  states  of  Minas  Gerais  and  Sao 
Paulo  dominated  the  system  and  swapped  the  presidency 
between  them  for  many  years.  The  system  consolidated  the 
state  oligarchies  around  families  that  had  been  members  of  the 
old  monarchial  elite.  And  to  check  the  nationalizing  tenden- 
cies of  the  army,  this  oligarchic  republic  and  its  state  compo- 
nents strengthened  the  navy  and  the  state  police.  In  the  larger 
states,  the  state  police  were  soon  turned  into  small  armies;  in 
the  extreme  case  of  Sao  Paulo,  French  military  advisers  were 
employed  after  1906. 

The  "politics  of  the  governors"  kept  a  relative  peace  until  the 
end  of  World  War  I.  Urban  Brazil,  the  one  foreigners  saw  from 
the  decks  of  ships,  prospered.  But  there  was  no  integrated 
national  economy.  Rather,  Brazil  had  a  grouping  of  regional 
economies  that  exported  their  own  specialty  products  to  Euro- 
pean and  North  American  markets.  The  absence  of  overland 
transportation,  except  for  the  mule  trains,  impeded  internal 
economic  integration,  political  cohesion,  and  military  effi- 
ciency. The  regions,  "the  Brazils"  as  the  British  called  them, 
moved  to  their  own  rhythms.  The  Northeast  exported  its  sur- 
plus cheap  labor  and  saw  its  political  influence  decline  as  its 
sugar  lost  foreign  markets  to  Caribbean  producers.  The  wild 


60 


Historical  Setting 


rubber  boom  in  Amazonia  lost  its  world  primacy  to  efficient 
Southeast  Asian  colonial  plantations  after  1912.  The  national- 
oriented  market  economies  of  the  South  were  not  dramatic, 
but  their  growth  was  steady  and  by  the  1920s  allowed  Rio 
Grande  do  Sul  to  exercise  considerable  political  leverage.  Real 
power  resided  in  the  coffee-growing  states  of  the  Southeast 
(Sudeste) — Sao  Paulo,  Minas  Gerais,  and  Rio  de  Janeiro — 
which  produced  the  most  export  revenue.  Those  three  and  Rio 
Grande  do  Sul  harvested  60  percent  of  Brazil's  crops,  turned 
out  75  percent  of  its  industrial  and  meat  products,  and  held  80 
percent  of  its  banking  resources. 

One  factor  that  eventually  would  draw  "the  Brazils"  closer 
together  was  the  heightened  sense  of  nationalism  that  devel- 
oped among  the  urban  middle  and  upper  classes  before  World 
War  I.  This  sense  of  nationalism  can  be  explained  partially  by 
the  Brazilian  elite's  focus  on  Rio  de  Janeiro  as  the  center  of 
their  world.  Although  the  national  government  was  weak,  it  was 
still  the  source  of  prestige  and  patronage.  Rio's  sanitation 
projects  and  its  remodeled  downtown  (1903-04)  were  soon 
copied  by  state  capitals  and  ports. 

The  elites  had  reason  to  think  that  Brazil's  status  in  the 
world  was  rising.  In  1905  the  archbishop  of  Rio  de  Janeiro 
received  Latin  America's  first  cardinalate.  Brazil  hosted  the 
Third  Pan-American  Conference,  raised  its  Washington  lega- 
tion to  an  embassy  (1904),  sent  a  notable  delegation  to  the  Sec- 
ond Hague  Peace  Conference  (1907),  gained  possession  via 
arbitration  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  square  kilometers  of 
disputed  territory,  established  the  Indian  Protective  Service, 
tied  together  the  far  reaches  of  the  country  via  telegraph,  and 
purchased  two  of  the  world's  largest  dreadnoughts  for  its  navy. 
Many  cheered  writer  Afonso  Celso  when  he  asserted  that  the 
era  was  "the  dawn  of  our  greatness  ....  We  will  be  the  second 
or  first  power  of  the  world." 

However,  the  enthusiasm  was  not  sufficient  to  overcome  the 
resistance  of  Brazilians  of  all  levels  to  military  service.  When  an 
Obligatory  Military  Service  Law  was  enacted  in  1908,  it  went 
unenforced  until  1916.  Military  service  was  unappealing 
because  members  were  called  on  continually  to  take  up  arms. 
During  the  presidency  of  Marshal  Hermes  Rodrigues  da  Fon- 
seca  (1910-14),  nephew  of  Deodoro  da  Fonseca,  turmoil 
spread  across  Brazil.  In  1910  sailors  protesting  extreme  physi- 
cal punishments  in  the  navy  seized  the  new  dreadnoughts  Sao 
Paulo  and  Minas  Gerais  and  some  smaller  vessels  in  the  bay  at

Rio  de  Janeiro  and  threatened  to  bombard  the  city.  Hermes  da 
Fonseca  was  forced  to  grant  the  rebels  their  demands  and  to 
give  them  amnesty. 

The  image  of  national  stability  with  which  the  earlier  Cam- 
pos Sales  administration  had  tried  to  dazzle  foreign  bankers 
also  was  shattered  by  a  series  of  military  interventions,  known 
as  the  Salvations,  that  replaced  a  number  of  state  governments. 
The  national  government,  somewhat  against  Hermes  da  Fon- 
seca's  inclination,  sponsored  what  amounted  to  coups  d'etat 
against  state  governments  in  Sergipe,  Pernambuco,  Alagoas, 
Para,  Piaui,  Bahia,  and  Ceara.  In  disorderly  fashion,  one  oligar- 
chic alliance  substituted  for  another,  often  with  an  army  officer 
in  charge.  In  the  disastrous  case  of  Bahia,  the  local  army  com- 
mander bombarded  the  governor's  palace  and  surrounding 
buildings.  In  1911  Sao  Paulo's  French-trained  Public  Force 
(Forca  Publica)  and  civilian  Patriotic  Battalions  saved  the  city 
from  similar  federal  intervention. 

Struggling  to  keep  control  of  the  army,  Hermes  da  Fonseca 
replaced  the  minister  of  war  three  times  in  sixteen  months  and 
forced  the  retirement  of  about  100  colonels  and  generals.  But 
to  keep  them  from  rebelling,  they  were  all  retired  at  higher 
ranks  and  salaries.  The  Brazilian  political  system  was  not  so 
much  one  of  compromise  as  of  co-optation.  With  this  internal 
army  purge,  the  Salvationist  Movement  spent  itself,  and  the 
tide  turned  away  from  federal  military  interventions  to  replace 
dominant  regional  oligarchies  toward  neutrality  or  preserving 
the  status  quo.  The  movement  can  be  seen  as  a  messy  attempt 
to  reduce  state  autonomy  and  to  heighten  the  power  of  the 
central  government. 

Meanwhile,  the  vision  of  Brazilian  order  and  progress  as 
seen  by  the  urban  elite,  intellectuals,  and  newspaper  editorials 
was  challenged  again  by  the  supposedly  anarchic  sertdo,  this 
time  in  the  South.  In  August  1914,  as  world  attention  focused 
on  the  outbreak  of  war  in  Europe,  a  very  different  conflict 
burst  forth  in  the  Contestado  region  of  Santa  Catarina.  A  popu- 
lar rebellion,  also  known  as  the  Contestado,  confronted  the 
"coloneT'-dominated  socioeconomic  and  political  system. 
Where  the  Salvationist  Movement  aimed  at  substituting  one  oli- 
garchy for  another,  the  Contestado  rebels  rejected  the  national 
system  and  wanted  to  remake  their  part  of  the  Brazilian  reality. 
As  with  Canudos,  the  response  of  state  and  federal  authorities 
was  pulverizing  violence.

Historical  Setting 


The  region's  economy  was  based  on  livestock,  the  collection 
of  mate,  and  lumbering.  Its  social  structure  concentrated 
wealth  and  power  in  the  hands  of  a  few  "colonels,"  around 
whom  lesser  landowners  were  arrayed.  Most  families  lived  at 
the  sufferance  of  those  men  or  had  shaky  land  titles.  A  jurisdic- 
tional dispute  between  Santa  Catarina  and  Parana  arose 
because  each  state  issued  deeds  to  the  same  land.  The  no- 
man's-land  attracted  fugitives  from  throughout  Brazil.  The  con- 
struction of  the  Sao  Paulo-Rio  Grande  do  Sul  Railroad  and  the 
timbering  and  colonization  operations  of  United  States  capital- 
ist Percival  Farquhar  added  foreign  elements  to  the  already  vol- 
atile mix.  The  Brazil  Railroad  and  the  Southern  Brazil  Lumber 
and  Colonization  Company  forced  Brazilians  off  their  expro- 
priated lands,  imported  European  immigrants,  and  sawed  away 
at  virgin  pine,  cedar,  and  walnut  trees.  People  whose  families 
had  lived  in  the  region  for  a  century  suddenly  saw  their  lands 
rented  or  sold  to  others.  As  if  that  were  not  enough,  in  1910 
the  threat  of  war  with  Argentina  loomed,  and  authorities 
speeded  the  railroad's  construction  and  expanded  labor  crews 
to  about  8,000.  In  this  environment  of  tumultuous  destruction 
of  the  forests,  social  tensions  rose  with  evictions  and  the  sud- 
den introduction  of  foreigners  and  modern  technology.  The 
local  "colonels"  secured  their  own  interests,  abandoning  their 
customary  paternalism  and  leaving  the  mass  of  people  adrift. 
The  Contestado  was  afflicted  with  a  collective  identity  crisis, 
which  caused  many  to  turn  to  messianic  religion  as  solace. 

The  people  of  the  Contestado  followed  a  local  healer, 
Miguel  Lucena  Boaventura,  known  as  Jose  Maria,  who  soon 
died  in  a  confrontation  with  Parana  Military  Police.  His  follow- 
ers refused  to  accept  his  death,  however,  and  believed  that  he 
was  either  alive  or  would  rise  again.  His  story  mixed  with  the 
Luso-Brazilian  belief  in  supernatural  assistance  in  desperate 
times.  This  phenomenon,  called  Sebastianism,  transformed  the 
submissive  population,  accustomed  to  acting  only  with  the 
"colonel's"  approval,  into  a  resolute  fighting  force.  Their 
attacks  on  the  railway  and  lumbering  operations  and  the  fail- 
ure of  negotiations  with  federal  authorities  led  to  an  escalation 
of  hostilities  in  1912  and  a  fierce  military  campaign  that  in 
1915  involved  6,000  troops,  modern  artillery  and  machine 
guns,  field  telephones  and  telegraph,  and  the  first  use  of  air- 
craft in  a  Brazilian  conflict.  The  fighting  was  spread  over  a  wide 
area,  and  the  many  redoubts  of  about  20,000  "fanatics,"  as  the 
army  called  them,  made  suppression  slow  and  difficult  and  also 


63

revealed  the  military's  weaknesses.  The  number  of  casualties 
was  uncertain  but  sizeable,  and  henceforth  the  army  main- 
tained a  garrison  in  the  region.  The  Gontestado  was  subdued 
by  the  end  of  1917. 

Army  reformers,  a  key  group  of  whom  returned  from  train- 
ing in  Germany  by  the  end  of  1913,  wrote  commentaries  on  the 
campaign  in  the  new  military  monthly,  A  Defesa  Nacional  They 
regarded  the  Contestado  as  "an  inglorious  conflict  that  discred- 
ited our  arms."  They  blamed  the  republic  for  its  "lack  of  ele- 
vated political  norms,  the  abandonment  of  thousands  of 
Brazilians  .  .  .  segregated  from  national  society  by  the  lack  of 
instruction,  by  the  scarcity  of  easy  means  of  communication,  by 
the  want  of  energy,  and  by  the  poverty  of  initiative  that,  unhap- 
pily, has  characterized  the  administrations  generally  since  the 
time  of  the  monarchy."  They  warned  military  leaders  that  "the 
lesson  of  the  Contestado"  was  that  the  army's  passivity  in 
accepting  poorly  conceived  political  measures  would  only  dam- 
age it  "morally"  and  would  bring  Brazil  "the  most  funereal  con- 
sequences." 

The  Contestado  joined  Canudos  as  an  important  compo- 
nent in  the  army's  institutional  memory.  Veterans  played  mean- 
ingful roles  in  military  and  national  affairs  in  the  next  decades. 
Within  a  few  years,  the  reformist  critique  would  be  part  of  the 
thinking  that  underlay  the  tenente  or  lieutenants'  revolts  of  the 
1920s,  beginning  with  the  Copacabana  Revolt  in  1922.  The  Sal- 
vationist Movement  and  the  Contestado  drew  the  army  and  the 
central  government  deeply  into  the  internal  affairs  of  the 
states,  thereby  whittling  away  at  their  coveted  autonomy.  The 
era's  legacy  of  political  intervention  and  suppression  of  dissent 
muddied  the  army's  mission  and  self-image,  but  it  amplified 
the  power  of  the  central  government  (Rio  de  Janeiro). 

The  growing  power  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  was  reflected  in  Brazil- 
ian foreign  affairs  under  the  guidance  of  Jose  Maria  da  Silva 
Paranhos,  the  Baron  of  Rio  Branco,  who  served  as  foreign  min- 
ister from  1902  to  1912,  under  presidents  Francisco  de  Paula 
Rodrigues  Alves  (acting  president,  1902-3;  president,  1903-6), 
and  Afonso  Pena  (1906-9),  Acting  President  Nilo  Pecanha 
(1909-10),  and  President  Hermes  da  Fonseca.  His  vision 
shaped  both  the  boundaries  of  the  country  and  the  traditions 
of  Brazilian  foreign  relations.  In  the  heyday  of  international 
imperialism,  he  was  instrumental  in  negotiating  limits  over 
which  the  great  powers  were  not  to  intrude.  He  argued  for  mil- 
itary reform  to  back  up  energetic  diplomacy,  and  he  began  the

process  of  moving  Brazil  out  of  the  British  orbit  and  into  that 
of  the  United  States.  The  latter  was  taking  half  of  Brazil's  total 
exports  by  1926,  but  Brazil  still  owed  Britain  over  US$100  mil- 
lion in  the  mid-1920s.  British  banks  financed  the  country's 
international  commercial  exchange,  and  British  investors  pro- 
vided 53  percent  of  the  total  foreign  investment  until  1930.  But 
by  the  late  1920s,  United  States  banks  held  nearly  35  percent  of 
the  foreign  debt.  Rio  Branco's  goal,  which  was  pursued  by  his 
successors,  was  to  diffuse  the  country's  dependency  among  the 
powers  so  that  none  could  intervene  without  being  checked  by 
another.  Trade  and  financial  ties  with  the  United  States  were 
increased  at  British  expense,  and  these  would  be  balanced  by 
military  links  with  Germany  and  then  France.  France  would 
continue  for  decades  to  provide  a  cultural  model  for  the  elites. 

The  Rio  Branco  years  were  the  basis  for  what  became  known 
as  the  Itamaraty  tradition  (named  after  the  building  that 
housed  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  in  Rio  de  Janeiro),  but 
not  every  administration  grasped  its  purpose.  Some  confused 
its  tactical  aspects — reliance  on  foreign  loans  and  investments, 
Pan-Americanism,  and  alliance  with  the  United  States — with  its 
essential  substance,  the  quest  for  independence  and  national 
greatness. 

World  War  I  found  Brazil  with  nearly  half  of  its  army  commit- 
ted in  the  Contestado.  The  war  in  Europe  was  traumatic  for  the 
army,  which  was  then  beginning  a  reorganization  under  the 
influence  of  thirty-two  officers  who  had  recently  returned  from 
service  in  German  army  units.  A  German  military  mission  had 
been  expected,  but  pressure  from  Sao  Paulo  and  from  Paris 
resulted  in  a  mission  contract  with  France  instead.  Economics, 
Washington's  decision  to  enter  the  war,  and  German  subma- 
rine attacks  on  Brazilian  merchant  ships  pulled  Brazil  into  the 
conflict  on  the  Allied  side.  The  military  mobilized,  but  the  gen- 
erals, feeling  over-committed  and  ill-prepared,  declined  to 
send  troops  to  Europe. 

Pan-Americanism  provided  some  outlet  for  Brazil's  interna- 
tional status  pretensions,  but  the  period  between  the  world 
wars  often  found  its  neighbor  Argentina  suspicious  of  harmless 
improvements  in  Brazil's  armed  forces.  Brazil's  obligatory  mili- 
tary service,  its  construction  of  new  barracks,  its  purchases  of 
modern  weapons,  and  its  contracts  for  a  French  military  mis- 
sion and  a  United  States  naval  mission  were  viewed  by  military 
officials  in  Buenos  Aires  as  threatening.  Brazilian  leaders 
wanted  their  country  regarded  as  the  most  powerful  in  South

America  but  understood  that  the  public  would  not  accept,  and 
the  constitution  outlawed,  a  war  of  aggression.  Regardless  of 
what  the  Argentines  thought,  the  military  was  not  prepared  to 
wage  a  foreign  war.  Tension  between  Argentina  and  Brazil  and 
maneuvering  for  greater  influence  in  Paraguay  and  Uruguay 
have  been  characteristic  of  their  relations  since  the  War  of  the 
Triple  Alliance. 

The  interwar  years  in  Brazil  saw  an  increase  in  labor  agita- 
tion as  the  economy  expanded,  industrialization  and  urbaniza- 
tion stepped  up,  and  immigrants  flowed  into  the  country. 
Coffee  overproduction  by  the  turn  of  the  century  had  pro- 
voked subsidization  programs  at  the  state  and  national  levels 
that  helped  the  planters  but  could  not  prevent  the  decline  in 
the  economy's  capacity  to  pay  for  imported  manufactured 
goods.  Local  industry  began  to  fill  the  gap.  World  War  I 
restricted  trade  further,  and  Brazilian  industrial  production 
increased  substantially.  The  government  stressed  the  need  for 
more  industrial  independence  from  foreign  producers  and 
stimulated  import  substitution,  particularly  in  textiles.  Many  of 
the  factories  were  small,  with  an  average  of  twenty-one  workers. 
In  1920  about  a  million  urban  workers  were  concentrated  in 
Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Sao  Paulo.  Brazil  was  just  beginning  to 
develop  its  industrial  base,  but  it  was  still  mainly  an  agricultural 
country  with  6.3  million  people  working  the  soil. 

The  living  conditions  of  urban  workers  were  bad.  Housing, 
transportation,  sewerage,  and  water  supply  trailed  far  behind 
the  rapid  population  growth  and  produced  serious  public 
health  problems.  The  clean-up  campaigns  at  the  beginning  of 
the  century  struck  at  the  high  incidence  of  yellow  fever, 
malaria,  and  smallpox  in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  Santos,  and  North- 
eastern seaports.  The  city  centers  were  made  safer,  but  the 
workers  who  crowded  into  sordid  "beehives"  (cortiQOS — small 
crowded  houses)  and  favelas  (shantytowns)  suffered  all  sorts  of 
ailments. 

The  federal  and  state  governments  subsidized  immigration 
from  Italy,  Portugal,  Spain,  Germany,  and  Japan  to  provide 
workers  for  the  coffee  plantations.  However,  many  immigrants 
soon  fled  the  rough  conditions  in  the  countryside  for  better 
opportunities  in  the  cities.  They  flooded  the  labor  pools,  mak- 
ing it  difficult  for  unions  to  force  factory  owners  to  pay  better 
wages.  Women,  who  were  the  majority  of  workers  in  the  textile 
and  clothing  industries,  were  frequently  active  in  organizing 
factory  commissions  to  agitate  for  improved  conditions,  free-

dom  from  sexual  abuse,  and  higher  pay.  Strikes  had  occurred 
in  1903,  1906,  and  1912,  and  in  1917  general  strikes  broke  out 
in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  Sao  Paulo,  Recife,  Santos,  and  Porto  Alegre. 
Because  the  mentality  of  the  industrialists  was  rooted  in  the  sla- 
very era  and  emphasized  their  well-being  over  that  of  the  com- 
monwealth and  because  they  functioned  on  a  thin  profit 
margin,  they  tended  to  fire  workers  for  striking  or  joining 
unions.  The  industrialists  also  blacklisted  troublemakers, 
employed  armed  thugs  to  keep  control  inside  and  outside  the 
factories,  and  called  on  the  government  to  repress  any  sign  of 
labor  organization.  There  were  no  large  massacres  of  strikers, 
as  occurred  in  Mexico  and  Chile,  but  the  physical  violence  was 
marked. 

Some  advocates  of  reform  were  heard.  For  example,  eco- 
nomic nationalists  like  Roberto  Simonsen  argued  for  improved 
pay  incentives  to  prevent  individual  workers  from  unionizing. 
During  the  1920s,  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  as  part  of  its 
effort  to  revive  its  status,  organized  the  Young  Catholic  Workers 
and  preached  the  example  of  the  Holy  Family  accepting  "the 
will  of  Providence,  in  pain  and  in  happiness."  By  1930  church 
societies,  private  charities,  factory-sponsored  recreational 
clubs,  and  government  agencies  strove  for  more  control  over 
workers'  organizations  and  leisure  time. 

During  the  Old  Republic,  Brazil  changed  at  a  frightening 
rate.  As  its  population  increased  162  percent  between  1890  and 
1930,  it  became  more  urbanized  and  industrialized,  and  its 
political  system  was  stretched  beyond  tolerance.  Concern  over 
the  resurgence  of  labor  activity  in  the  late  1920s  was  one  of  the 
factors  that  led  to  the  collapse  of  the  Old  Republic  in  1930  and 
to  the  subsequent  significant  change  in  labor  and  social  policy. 

The  Era  of  Getulio  Vargas,  1930-54 

Just  as  the  1889  regime  change  led  to  a  decade  of  unrest  and 
painful  adjustment,  so  too  did  the  revolts  of  1930.  Provisional 
President  Getulio  Dorneles  Vargas  ruled  as  dictator  (1930-34), 
congressionally  elected  president  (1934-37),  and  again  dicta- 
tor (1937-45),  with  the  backing  of  his  revolutionary  coalition. 
He  also  served  as  a  senator  (1946-51)  and  the  popularly 
elected  president  (1951-54).  Vargas  was  a  member  of  the  gau- 
cho-landed  oligarchy  and  had  risen  through  the  system  of 
patronage  and  clientelism,  but  he  had  a  fresh  vision  of  how 
Brazilian  politics  could  be  shaped  to  support  national  develop- 
ment. He  understood  that  with  the  breakdown  of  direct  rela- 


67

tions  between  workers  and  owners  in  the  expanding  factories 
of  Brazil,  workers  could  become  the  basis  for  a  new  form  of 
political  power — populism.  Using  such  insights,  he  would  grad- 
ually establish  such  mastery  over  the  Brazilian  political  world 
that  he  would  stay  in  power  for  fifteen  years.  During  those 
years,  the  preeminence  of  the  agricultural  elites  ended,  new 
urban  industrial  leaders  acquired  more  influence  nationally, 
and  the  middle  class  began  to  show  some  strength. 

Tenentismo,  or  the  lieutenants'  rebellion  against  the  army  and 
governmental  hierarchies,  faded  as  a  distinctive  movement 
after  1931,  in  part  because  its  adherents  promoted  the  preser- 
vation of  state  autonomy  when  the  trend  toward  increased  cen- 
tralization was  strong.  Individual  lieutenants  continued  to 
exercise  important  roles,  but  they  made  their  peace  with  the 
traditional  political  forces.  In  1932  Sao  Paulo,  whose  interests 
and  pride  suffered  under  the  new  regime,  rose  in  revolt.  The 
three-month  civil  war  saw  many  officers  who  had  lost  out  in 
1930  or  were  otherwise  disgruntled  join  the  Paulistas,  but  fede- 
ral forces  defeated  them. 

A  new  constitution  in  1934  reorganized  the  political  system 
by  creating  a  legislature  with  both  state  and  social-sector  repre- 
sentatives. It  contained  some  electoral  reforms,  including 
women's  suffrage,  a  secret  ballot,  and  special  courts  to  super- 
vise elections.  The  Constituent  Assembly  elected  Vargas  presi- 
dent for  a  four-year  term.  However,  the  attempt  to  harness  the 
revolution  to  the  old  system,  somewhat  remodeled,  would  soon 
fail  completely  and  take  Brazil  into  prolonged  dictatorship. 
The  left  helped  in  that  process  by  becoming  a  creditable 
threat.  On  misguided  instructions  from  Moscow  based  on  mis- 
information from  Brazil,  the  Brazilian  communists,  led  by  a 
former  tenente,  staged  a  revolt  in  1935,  but  it  was  rapidly  sup- 
pressed. 

In  the  1930s,  the  civilian  elites  feared  that  Brazil  would  suf- 
fer a  civil  war  similar  to  Spain's,  and  so  for  the  first  time  in  Bra- 
zilian history  they  supported  a  strong,  unified  military.  The 
Estado  Novo  gave  the  army  its  long-held  desire  for  control  over 
the  states'  Military  Police  (Policia  Militar)  units.  The  elites  of 
the  old  state  pdtrias  gave  up  their  independent  military  power 
in  return  for  federal  protection  of  their  interests.  This  process 
was  not  always  a  willing  one,  as  the  Paulista  revolt  of  1932 
showed,  but  federal  monopoly  of  military  force  escalated  the 
power  of  the  central  government  to  levels  previously  unknown.

Historical  Setting 


A  significant  turning  point  in  the  history  of  Brazil  had  been 
reached. 

Under  the  Estado  Novo,  state  autonomy  ended,  appointed 
federal  officials  replaced  governors,  and  patronage  flowed 
from  the  president  downward.  All  political  parties  were  dis- 
solved until  1944,  thus  limiting  opportunities  for  an  opposition 
to  organize.  In  the  process,  Vargas  eliminated  threats  from  the 
left  and  the  right.  At  the  local  level,  "colonels"  survived  by 
declaring  their  loyalty  and  accepting  their  share  of  patronage 
for  distribution  to  their  own  underlings.  The  Vargas  years  had 
their  greatest  impact  on  national  politics  and  economics  and 
their  least  impact  at  the  local  level  where  the  older  forms  of 
power  continued  well  into  the  1950s.  Even  in  the  1990s,  local 
political  bosses  were  tagged  "colonels."  Vargas  took  care  to 
absorb  the  rural  and  commercial  elites  into  his  power  base.  He 
had  the  ability  to  make  former  enemies  supporters,  or  at  least 
neutrals. 

The  Vargas  years  saw  the  reorganization  of  the  armed  forces, 
the  economy,  international  trade,  and  foreign  relations.  The 
government  restored  the  old  imperial  palace  in  Petropolis  and 
encouraged  the  preservation  of  historic  buildings  and  towns. 
The  average  annual  rise  in  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — 
see  Glossary)  was  nearly  4  percent.  Brazil's  first  steel  mill  at 
Volta  Redonda  (1944)  was  the  start  of  the  great  industrial  out- 
put of  the  second  half  of  the  century.  The  1930-45  era  added 
corporatism  (see  Glossary)  to  the  Brazilian  political  lexicon. 

Even  as  it  channeled  investment  into  industry,  the  Estado 
Novo  classified  strikes  as  crimes  and  grouped  the  government- 
controlled  unions  into  separate  sector  federations  that  were 
not  allowed  to  form  across-the-board  national  organizations. 
The  idea  was  to  keep  the  lines  of  control  vertical  (vertical  inte- 
gration— see  Glossary) .  The  government  decreed  regular  wage 
and  benefits  increases  and  slowly  expanded  an  incomplete 
social  security  system.  Its  minimum  wage  levels  were  never  satis- 
factory. The  regime's  propaganda  touted  state  paternalism  and 
protection  and  depicted  Vargas  as  the  benefactor  of  the  work- 
ing classes.  He  also  was  the  benefactor  of  the  factory  owners, 
who  saw  industry  expand  11.2  percent  a  year  throughout  the 
1930s,  which  meant  that  it  more  than  doubled  during  the 
decade.  Indeed,  growth  and  repression  were  the  twin  orders  of 
the  day.  Journalists  and  novelists  were  censored,  jailed,  and  dis- 
couraged. The  army  restricted  access  to  the  military  schools  to 


69 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

those  with  acceptable  racial,  familial,  religious,  educational, 
and  political  characteristics. 

As  a  result  of  these  repressive  measures,  the  suspension  of 
political  activities,  and  the  government's  support  of  rearming 
and  modernizing  the  military,  the  army  gained  a  coherence 
and  unity  that  it  had  not  experienced  since  before  1922.  The 
popular  status  that  the  army  won  by  participating  in  the  Italian 
campaign  (1944-45)  of  World  War  II  also  permitted  the  High 
Command,  under  General  Pedro  Aurelio  de  Goes  Monteiro,  a 
long-time  supporter  of  Vargas,  to  step  into  the  successionist  cri- 
sis of  October  1945  to  depose  Vargas  and  to  cut  short  the  polit- 
ical mobilization  of  the  masses  that  the  generals  believed  would 
upset  the  social  order.  Not  to  have  acted  would  have  violated 
the  implicit  agreement  made  with  the  elites  when  the  latter  sur- 
rendered their  independent  state  military  forces  to  federal 
control. 

The  elected  government  over  which  President  Eurico  Gas- 
par  Dutra  presided  from  1946  to  1951  opened  under  the 
decree  laws  of  the  Estado  Novo  and  continued  under  the  new 
constitution  of  1946.  This  charter  reflected  the  strong  conser- 
vative tendency  in  Brazilian  politics  by  incorporating  ideas 
from  the  constitution  of  1934  and  the  social  legislation  of  the 
Estado  Novo.  Over  the  next  years,  the  various  cabinet  changes 
traced  the  government's  steady  movement  toward  the  right. 
The  Dutra  administration  was  supported  by  the  same  conserva- 
tive interventionist  army  that  had  backed  the  previous  regime. 
Indeed,  Dutra,  who  though  retired  from  active  duty,  was  inau- 
gurated in  his  dress  uniform  and  was  promoted  to  general  of 
the  army  and  then  to  marshal  while  in  office,  made  the  point 
that  he  still  belonged  to  the  military  class  (classe  militar),  that 
he  would  not  neglect  its  needs,  and  that  he  would  guide  the 
army  politically. 

More  dispassionate  observers  see  the  ending  of  Vargas's  pro- 
ductive leadership — during  which  the  average  annual  rise  in 
the  GDP  was  nearly  4  percent — as  the  reaction  of  the  landown- 
ing and  business  elite  allied  with  the  urban  middle  class  against 
the  processes  of  change.  Dutra's  years  in  office  displayed  a  min- 
imal level  of  state  participation  and  intervention  in  the  econ- 
omy. It  was  indeed  ironic  that  the  man  who  led  Brazil  through 
the  first  steps  of  its  "experiment  with  democracy"  was  a  general 
who,  in  the  early  years  of  World  War  II,  was  so  antiliberal  that 
he  had  opposed  aligning  Brazil  with  the  democratic  countries 
against  Nazi  Germany.  He  was  a  fervent  anticommunist,  who 


70

quickly  broke  the  diplomatic  ties  Vargas  had  established  with 
the  Soviet  Union,  outlawed  the  Brazilian  Communist  Party,  and 
supported  the  United  States  in  the  opening  phases  of  the  Cold 
War.  He  exchanged  official  visits  with  President  Harry  S.  Tru- 
man and  sought  American  aid  for  continued  economic  devel- 
opment. 

Dutra's  government  improved  the  railways,  completed  con- 
struction of  roads  that  connected  Rio  de  Janeiro  to  Salvador 
and  Sao  Paulo,  and  expanded  the  electrical  generating  and 
transmission  systems.  It  also  cooperated  with  the  states  in  build- 
ing more  than  4,000  new  rural  schools  and  supported  con- 
struction of  new  university  buildings  in  various  states.  In  1951  it 
also  created  the  National  Research  Council  (Conselho  Nacio- 
nal  de  Pesquisas — CNPq),  which  would  be  important  in  devel- 
oping capabilities  and  university  faculties  in  coming  decades 
(see  Science  and  Technology  as  Modernization,  1945-64,  ch. 
6).  His  mandate  was  marked  by  heated  disputes  over  the 
nationalization  of  oil  and  plans  for  an  international  institute  to 
study  Amazonia.  The  latter  were  shelved  amidst  emotional 
charges  that  they  would  lead  to  the  loss  of  half  of  the  national 
territory;  and  the  campaign  for  the  former  was  suppressed  vio- 
lently 

Dutra's  military  program  included  domestic  arms  produc- 
tion, sending  many  officers  for  training  in  the  United  States, 
expanding  air  force  and  naval  schools  and  modernizing  their 
equipment,  and  establishing  the  War  College  (Escola  Superior 
de  Guerra — ESG),  which  played  such  an  important  role  in  the 
political  crises  of  the  1960s.  Although  Dutra  could  be  criticized 
for  not  containing  inflation  and  for  allowing  an  importing 
frenzy  that  soon  exhausted  the  savings  of  the  war  years,  he 
managed  to  govern  without  declaring  a  state  of  siege,  and  he 
was  the  first  elected  president  since  1926  to  pass  the  office  to 
his  elected  successor. 

As  a  candidate  for  president  in  the  1950  elections,  Vargas 
advocated  accelerating  industrialization  and  expanding  social 
legislation,  and  he  was  rewarded  with  a  sizeable  49  percent  of 
the  vote.  Vargas's  attempts  to  base  his  elected  government 
(1951-54)  firmly  on  populism  induced  military,  elite,  and 
United  States  fears  of  nationalism.  Even  so,  it  was  a  period  of 
deepening  political  polarization.  Anticommunist  military  offic- 
ers saw  red  in  every  attempt  to  expand  labor's  influence  and 
objected  to  wage  increases  for  workers  when  the  value  of  their 
own  salaries  was  eroding  steadily.  The  United  States  refused 


71 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

economic  assistance  that  Brazilian  leaders  believed  they 
deserved  for  providing  bases,  natural  resources,  and  troops 
during  World  War  II.  The  lack  of  postwar  benefits,  especially 
for  the  service  of  the  Brazilian  Expeditionary  Force  (Forca 
Expedicionaria  Brasileira — FEB),  caused  Vargas  and  part  of 
the  military  to  reject  the  idea  of  sending  troops  to  fight  in 
Korea. 

Although  the  United  States  government  did  not  want  to  pro- 
vide economic  aid,  it  also  did  not  want  the  Brazilian  govern- 
ment to  take  an  active  role  in  developing  the  country's 
resources.  Washington's  desire  to  secure  Brazil  as  a  safe  place 
for  private  United  States  investment  clashed  with  Brazil's  treat- 
ment of  foreign-owned  utilities.  Foreign  interests  had  been  too 
slow  in  developing  energy  resources,  so  the  Vargas  government 
created  the  Brazilian  Petroleum  Corporation  (Petroleo 
Brasileiro  S.A. — Petrobras)  in  1953  and  the  Brazilian  Electric 
Power  Company  (Centrais  Eletricas  Brasileiras  S.A. — Eletro- 
bras)  in  1961.  The  "Petroleum  is  Ours!"  campaign  of  the 
nationalists  caused  arguments  within  the  military  over  what  was 
best  to  do.  Some  officers  embraced  the  antistatist  attitude  that 
Washington  was  sponsoring.  The  bitterly  fought,  emotional 
debate  over  the  creation  of  Petrobras  poisoned  political  life 
and  contributed  to  the  subsequent  military  interventions.  The 
Vargas  administration  dissolved  in  frustration  and  charges  of 
corruption;  faced  with  military  demands  for  his  resignation, 
Vargas  shot  himself  on  August  24,  1954.  His  death  produced 
considerable  public  sympathy,  which  in  turn  strengthened  his 
reputation  as  "father  of  the  poor."  His  influence  in  Brazilian 
politics  was  felt  for  decades. 

The  Post- Vargas  Republic,  1954-64 

If  corporatism  was  the  hallmark  of  the  1930s  and  1940s,  pop- 
ulism, nationalism,  and  developmentalism  characterized  the 
1950s  and  early  1960s.  Each  of  these  contributed  to  the  crisis 
that  gripped  Brazil  and  resulted  in  the  authoritarian  regime 
after  1964.  At  the  core  of  the  crisis  was  the  continued  unwilling- 
ness of  the  elite  to  share  the  benefits  of  Brazil's  wealth  with  the 
majority  of  the  people.  By  the  early  1960s,  the  crisis  was  boiling 
in  reverse,  from  the  top  down.  The  crisis  had  much  more  to  do 
with  elite  fears  of  a  mass  uprising,  supposedly  instigated  by 
international  communism,  than  with  the  reality  of  social  revo- 
lution. They,  rather  than  the  masses,  believed  the  fiery  rhetoric 
of  leftist-populist  politicians.  What  elites  elsewhere  might  have 


72 


Historical  Setting 


seen  as  popular  democratic  mobilization,  the  Brazilian  elites 
saw  as  revolutionary  change  that  threatened  their  well-being. 
Because  they  portrayed  their  well-being  as  the  same  as  the 
national  well-being,  and  because  they  controlled  the  state  and 
the  instruments  of  power,  they  responded  with  a  counterrevo- 
lution, what  historian  Joseph  Page  labeled  "the  revolution  that 
never  was." 

Labor  became  more  active  in  seeking  to  improve  the  status 
of  the  working  class,  and  the  population  continued  to  grow 
beyond  the  state's  ability  to  expand  educational  and  social  ser- 
vices. As  a  result,  conservative  elites  feared  that  they  were  los- 
ing control  of  politics  and  of  the  state.  The  elites  had  opposed 
Vargas  because  he  sought  to  use  the  state  to  spread  benefits 
more  broadly.  The  middle  classes  tended  to  identify  with  elite 
visions  of  society  and  to  see  the  lower  classes  as  a  threat.  Curi- 
ously, the  term  povo  (people),  which  had  meant  the  lowest 
class,  the  destitute,  the  squatters,  the  rural  poor,  had  changed 
by  the  early  1950s  to  mean  the  politically  active  and  economi- 
cally mobile  urban  lower  classes.  Further,  politicians  appealed 
to  the  povo  during  election  campaigns  but  once  elected 
directed  government  benefits  principally  to  the  middle  and 
upper  classes. 

Juscelino  Kubitschek  (1956-61),  the  only  post-Vargas  elected 
president  to  serve  a  full  term,  soothed  opponents  by  avoiding 
the  emotional  appeals  of  the  populists.  Even  so,  his  common 
touch  reached  millions,  and  his  developmentalist  and  national- 
ist visions  stirred  the  Brazilian  imagination.  Kubitschek  co- 
opted  the  military  by  involving  it  in  the  decision-making  pro- 
cess and  by  adequately  funding  it.  He  pushed  the  creation  of 
an  automotive  industry,  which  in  a  generation  would  result  in 
Brazil's  leaping  from  the  bull  cart  and  mule  train  era  into  that 
of  the  internal  combustion  engine.  The  new  factories  turned 
out  321,000  vehicles  in  1960.  The  great  highway  network  of  the 
late  twentieth  century  and  the  world's  eighth-largest  automo- 
bile production  are  his  legacies.  And  he  yanked  Brazil  away 
from  its  fascination  with  the  coast  by  moving  the  capital  to 
Brasilia  in  a  new  Federal  District  (Distrito  Federal)  carved  out 
of  then-distant  Goias.  Thanks  to  the  changes  in  transportation 
and  the  growing  availability  of  motorized  farm  equipment,  the 
vast  countryside  of  Goias  and  Mato  Grosso  would  be  cultivated 
in  the  next  decades,  and  Brazil  would  become  the  world's  num- 
ber-two food  exporter.  The  overall  economy  would  expand  8.3

percent  a  year.  There  was  a  lot  of  truth  in  his  government's 
motto:  "Fifty  Years'  Progress  in  Five." 

Brazil  of  1960  was  very  different  from  that  of  1930.  The  pop- 
ulation, which  had  been  33.5  million  in  1930,  was  now  70  mil- 
lion, with  44  percent  in  urban  areas.  A  third  of  all  Latin 
Americans  were  Brazilian.  Life  expectancy  had  improved 
noticeably.  The  number  of  industrial  workers  had  more  than 
doubled  from  a  1940  level  of  1.6  million  to  2.9  million,  and  the 
industrial  share  of  GDP  was  higher  (25.2  percent)  than  that  of 
agriculture  (22.5  percent).  The  underside  of  such  progress  was 
a  continuous  swelling  of  urban  slums  and  inflation.  The  annual 
rate  of  inflation  rose  from  12  percent  in  1949  to  26  percent  in 
1959,  and  then  zoomed  to  a  shocking  39.5  percent  in  1960. 
Savings  depreciated,  lenders  refused  to  offer  long-term  loans, 
interest  rates  soared,  and  the  government  refused  to  undertake 
orthodox,  anti-inflationary  programs  styled  after  those  of  the 
International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary).  Moreover, 
the  disparities  between  rich  and  poor  remained,  with  40  per- 
cent of  national  income  enjoyed  by  10  percent  of  the  popula- 
tion, 36  percent  going  to  the  next  30  percent,  and  24  percent 
being  divided  among  the  poorest  60  percent  of  Brazilians. 
Before  national  wealth  could  be  redistributed,  however,  devel- 
opment had  to  be  maintained. 

Brazil  had  the  potential,  but  it  lacked  the  hard  currency  nec- 
essary to  pay  for  the  imports  needed  to  sustain  swift  industrial- 
ization. Either  it  could  cut  imports,  thereby  paralyzing  factories 
and  transportation,  or  it  could  stop  repayments  on  foreign 
loans  and  profit  remittances  from  foreign  investments.  With 
such  unpalatable  alternatives,  it  is  not  surprising  that  Brazilian 
governments  had  difficulty  formulating  an  economic  plan  that 
would  both  satisfy  creditors  and  keep  trade  flowing. 

The  populist  administrations  of  Janio  Quadros  (January- 
August  1961)  andjoao  Goulart  (1961-64)  expanded  the  term 
povo  once  again  to  embrace  the  rural  poor,  thereby  producing 
the  image  of  a  budding  proletariat  ready  to  join  a  reformist 
government  against  elite  privilege  and  United  States  imperial- 
ism. Quadros,  a  former  governor  of  Sao  Paulo,  could  not  keep 
his  promise  to  sweep  out  corruption,  because  his  bid  for  more 
presidential  power  ended  with  his  sudden  resignation  on 
August  25,  1961.  He  had  assembled  a  makeshift  political  coali- 
tion that  gave  him  an  impressive  electoral  margin  but  did  not 
give  him  enough  influence  in  Congress  to  get  his  legislation 
passed.

Frustrated,  he  planned  to  restructure  the  government,  but 
before  he  could  act,  Carlos  Lacerda,  governor  of  Guanabara 
(the  old  Rio  de  Janeiro  Federal  District),  revealed  that 
Quadros  intended  to  close  Congress,  decree  reforms,  and  get 
the  people's  blessing  in  a  plebiscite.  Quadros  and  Lacerda 
clashed  over  the  issue  of  an  independent  foreign  policy.  Such  a 
policy,  which  Quadros  supported,  emphasized  new  markets  for 
Brazilian  products  and  a  strong  stance  in  favor  of  the  develop- 
ing world,  while  maintaining  relations  with  the  United  States 
but  refusing  to  isolate  Cuba.  Lacerda  was  particularly  critical  of 
Quadros's  pro-Cuba  policy.  Quadros  resigned  believing  that 
the  military  would  be  unwilling  to  allow  Vice  President  Joao 
Goulart,  a  populist  and  former  minister  of  labor  under  Vargas, 
to  assume  the  presidency.  Quadros  hoped  that  his  action  would 
shock  the  povo  into  taking  to  the  streets  to  demand  his  reimpo- 
sition  and  would  spur  the  military  into  pressuring  Congress. 
He  then  flew  to  Sao  Paulo,  where  he  spent  the  next  day  at  a 
military  base  waiting  for  the  summons  to  return,  but  instead 
the  head  of  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  was  sworn  in  as  acting 
president.  People  were  shocked,  but  they  tended  to  feel 
betrayed  by  Quadros  rather  than  believe  that  "terrible  forces"

had  risen  against  him.  On  that  Friday  in  August  1961,  the 
republic  of  1945  began  its  painful  death. 

Instead  of  worrying  how  to  restore  Quadros,  the  politicians 
and  military  leaders  focused  on  Goulart's  succession.  An 
uneasy  country  awaited  Goulart  on  his  return  from  a  trade  mis- 
sion to  China.  Congress  refused  to  agree  to  the  request  of  the 
military  ministers  that  it  disavow  his  right  to  the  presidency.  His 
brother-in-law,  Leonel  de  Moura  Brizola,  the  fiery  governor  of 
Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  and  the  regional  army  commander 
announced  that  their  forces  would  defend  the  constitution. 
The  threat  of  civil  war  was  ominous.  Instead,  a  compromise 
changed  the  constitutional  system  from  a  presidential  to  a  par- 
liamentary one  (1961-63),  with  Goulart  as  president  and  Tan- 
credo  de  Almeida  Neves  of  Minas  Gerais  as  prime  minister.  In 
the  next  months,  Goulart,  chafing  at  the  attempt  to  turn  him 
into  a  figurehead,  made  heated  appeals  to  the  masses  to  mobi- 
lize in  his  favor.  Goulart  secured  victory  in  a  1962  plebiscite, 
which  restored  the  presidential  system  in  January  1963.  Unhap- 
pily, Goulart  interpreted  the  five-to-one  margin  as  a  personal 
mandate,  as  opposed  to  a  mandate  for  the  presidential  system. 

Goulart's  relations  with  the  United  States  went  from  uneasy, 
when  he  visited  President  John  F.  Kennedy  and  gave  a  speech 
to  the  United  States  Congress  in  April  1963,  to  frigid,  when 
President  Lyndon  B.  Johnson  took  over  in  Washington  in 
November  1963.  The  United  States,  smarting  from  Fidel  Cas- 
tro's radicalization  of  Cuba,  resented  Brazilian  unwillingness  to 
isolate  Havana  and  became  obsessed  with  peasants  organizing 
in  the  impoverished  Northeast.  Washington  poured  millions  of 
dollars  directly  into  that  region's  states,  bypassing  Goulart's 
government.  The  regional  elites  happily  accepted  United 
States  aid  to  expand  their  autonomy  vis-a-vis  Brasilia. 

Goulart  carried  his  populism  too  far  when  he  backed  pro- 
posals for  noncommissioned  officers  to  hold  political  office 
and  when  he  appeared  sympathetic  to  rebelling  sergeants  in 
September  1963.  The  officer  corps  believed  that  the  president 
was  undermining  discipline,  thereby  threatening  military  insti- 
tutions. 

Minister  of  Army  General  Amaury  Kruel  complained  that 
the  army  had  been  subjected  to  a  "survival"  budget  since  1958 
and  that  most  of  its  armaments  and  equipment  were  either 
obsolete,  beyond  repair,  or  required  replacement.  In  1962 
every  regional  army  headquarters  reported  that  it  was  not  in 
condition  to  hold  regular  exercises,  and  many  officers  con-

eluded  that  their  efforts  were  useless  because  of  a  generalized 
"disbelief  and  lack  of  incentive."  General  Kruel  alerted  Presi- 
dent Goulart  that  inadequate  funding  was  creating  a  "calami- 
tous situation"  in  which  the  army  was  being  "economically  and 
financially  asphyxiated." 

The  right  and  the  military  charged  that  Goulart's  call  for 
reforming  legislation  was  merely  a  cover  for  a  radical  national- 
ist takeover.  Publicly,  they  organized  study  groups,  formed  a 
shadow  government,  orchestrated  an  intense  press  campaign, 
and  staged  street  marches.  Secretly,  they  armed  large  landown- 
ers (fazendeiros)  in  the  countryside,  developed  plans  to  neutral- 
ize opposition  and  to  topple  the  government,  and  sought  help 
from  the  United  States.  The  military  was  again  about  to  break 
the  bonds  of  obedience  to  a  national  government.  The  argu- 
ment was  that  the  armed  forces  should  support  any  govern- 
ment as  long  as  it  was  democratic. 

Such  logic  grew  more  persuasive  as  political  mobilization 
gripped  the  society.  Peasant  land  seizures  and  urban  food  riots 
contributed  to  a  sense  of  impending  chaos.  Brizola  bragged 
foolishly  that  he  had  a  200,000-strong  peoples'  militia  orga- 
nized in  groups  of  eleven.  The  opposition  charged  the  govern- 
ment with  arousing  a  "state  of  revolutionary  war."  In  the 
months  before  March  1964,  the  staff  and  student  officers  of  the 
Army  General  Staff  School  (Escola  de  Comando  de  Estado- 
Maior  do  Exercito — ECEME)  played  a  key  role  in  convincing 
officers  that  they  should  support  a  move  against  Goulart.  Even 
the  highly  respected  chief  of  staff,  Marshal  Humberto  de  Alen- 
car  Castelo  Branco,  joined  the  conspiracy.  Castelo  Branco  had 
served  as  FEB  operations  officer  in  Italy,  director  of  studies  at 
ECEME,  and  long-time  head  of  the  War  College.  The  officers 
believed  that  rational  economic  development,  internal  security, 
and  institutional  well-being  would  occur  only  if  economic  and 
political  structures  were  altered,  and  that  the  civilian  leaders 
were  unwilling  to  make  the  necessary  changes.  They  believed 
that  the  left  was  so  well-organized  that  the  conspiracy  might 
fail.  They  had  plans  to  flee  Brazil  in  that  case,  and  United 
States  officers  had  promised  that  they  would  receive  training 
and  logistical  support  to  return  to  wage  a  guerrilla  war. 

Struggling  to  keep  the  impatient  left  on  his  side  and  to  stave 
off  the  right,  Goulart  opted  for  a  series  of  public  rallies  to 
mobilize  pressure  for  basic  reforms.  In  a  huge  rally  in  Rio  de 
Janeiro  on  March  13,  1964,  Goulart  decreed  agrarian  reform 
and  rent  controls  and  promised  more.  A  counter  rally  against 


77 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

the  government,  held  six  days  later  in  Sao  Paulo,  put  500,000 
people  marching  in  the  streets.  Sailors  and  marines  in  Rio  de 
Janeiro,  led  by  an  agent  provocateur  of  the  anti-Goulart  con- 
spiracy, mutinied  in  support  of  Goulart.  However,  Goulart  mis- 
handled the  incident  by  agreeing  that  they  would  not  be 
punished  and  that  the  navy  minister  would  be  changed.  The 
uproar  was  immediate.  Rio  de  Janeiro's  Correio  da  Manha  pub- 
lished an  unusual  Easter  Sunday  edition  with  the  headline 
"Enough!"  It  was  followed  the  next  day,  March  30,  with  one  say- 
ing "Out!"  In  the  next  two  days,  the  military  moved  to  secure 
the  country,  and  Goulart  fled  to  Uruguay.  Brizola's  resistance 
groups  proved  an  illusion,  as  did  the  supposed  arms  caches  of 
the  unions  and  the  readiness  of  favela  residents  to  attack  the 
wealthy.  The  period  of  the  military  republic  had  begun. 

The  Military  Republic,  1 964-85 

The  military  held  power  from  1964  until  March  1985  not  by 
design  but  because  of  political  struggles  within  the  new  regime. 
Just  as  the  regime  changes  of  1889,  1930,  and  1945  unleashed 
competing  political  forces  and  caused  splits  in  the  military,  so 
too  did  the  regime  change  of  1964.  Because  no  civilian  politi- 
cian was  acceptable  to  all  the  revolutionary  factions,  the  army 
chief  of  staff,  Marshal  Humberto  Castelo  Branco  (president, 
1964-67),  became  president  with  the  intention  of  overseeing  a 
reform  of  the  political-economic  system.  He  refused  to  stay 
beyond  the  term  of  deposed  Joao  Goulart  or  to  institutionalize 
the  military  in  power.  However,  competing  demands  radical- 
ized the  situation;  military  hard-liners  wanted  a  complete 
purge  of  left-wing  and  populist  influences,  while  civilian  politi- 
cians obstructed  Castelo  Branco's  reforms.  The  latter  accused 
him  of  dictatorial  methods,  and  the  former  criticized  him  for 
not  going  far  enough.  To  satisfy  the  military  hard-liners,  he 
recessed  and  purged  Congress,  removed  objectionable  state 
governors,  and  decreed  expansion  of  the  president's  (and 
thereby  the  military's)  arbitrary  powers  at  the  expense  of  the 
legislature  and  judiciary.  His  gamble  succeeded  in  curbing  the 
populist  left  but  provided  the  successor  governments  of  Mar- 
shal Artur  da  Costa  e  Silva  (1967-69)  and  General  Emflio  Gar- 
rastazu  Medici  (1969-74)  with  a  basis  for  authoritarian  rule. 
Anti-Goulart  politicians  understood  too  late  the  forces  they 
had  helped  unleash. 

Castelo  Branco  tried  to  maintain  a  degree  of  democracy.  His 
economic  reforms  prepared  the  way  for  the  Brazilian  eco-

nomic  "miracle"  of  the  next  decade,  and  his  restructuring  of 
the  party  system  that  had  existed  since  1945  shaped  the  con- 
tours of  government-opposition  relations  for  the  next  two 
decades.  He  preserved  presidential  supremacy  over  the  mili- 
tary and  kept  potential  coup-makers  in  check,  but  in  the  pro- 
cess he  had  to  expand  presidential  powers  in  the  infamous 
Second  Institutional  Act  of  October  1965,  and  he  had  to  accept 
the  succession  of  Minister  of  Army  Costa  e  Silva. 

As  in  earlier  regime  changes,  the  armed  forces'  officer  corps 
was  divided  between  those  who  believed  that  they  should  con- 
fine themselves  to  their  professional  duties  and  the  hard-liners 
who  regarded  politicians  as  scoundrels  ready  to  betray  Brazil  to 
communism  or  some  other  menace.  The  victory  of  the  hard- 
liners dragged  Brazil  into  what  political  scientist  Juan  J.  Linz 
called  "an  authoritarian  situation."  However,  because  the  hard- 
liners could  not  ignore  the  counterweight  opinions  of  their 
colleagues  or  the  resistance  of  society,  they  were  unable  to  insti- 
tutionalize their  agenda  politically.  In  addition,  they  did  not 
attempt  to  eliminate  the  trappings  of  liberal  constitutionalism 
because  they  feared  disapproval  of  international  opinion  and 
damage  to  the  alliance  with  the  United  States.  As  the  citadel  of 
anticommunism,  the  United  States  provided  the  ideology  that 


79

the  authoritarians  used  to  justify  their  hold  on  power.  But 
Washington  also  preached  liberal  democracy,  which  forced  the 
authoritarians  to  assume  the  contradictory  position  of  defend- 
ing democracy  by  destroying  it.  Their  concern  for  appearances 
caused  them  to  abstain  from  personalist  dictatorship  by  requir- 
ing each  successive  general-president  to  pass  power  to  his 
replacement. 

The  role  of  the  United  States  in  these  events  was  complex 
and  at  times  contradictory.  An  anti-Goulart  press  campaign  was 
conducted  throughout  1963,  and  in  1964  the  Johnson  adminis- 
tration gave  moral  support  to  the  campaign.  Ambassador  Lin- 
coln Gordon  later  admitted  that  the  embassy  had  given  money 
to  anti-Goulart  candidates  in  the  1962  municipal  elections  and 
had  encouraged  the  plotters;  that  many  extra  United  States 
military  and  intelligence  personnel  were  operating  in  Brazil; 
and  that  four  United  States  Navy  oil  tankers  and  the  carrier  For- 
restal,  in  an  operation  code-named  Brother  Sam,  had  stood  off 
the  coast  in  case  of  need  during  the  1964  coup.  Washington 
immediately  recognized  the  new  government  in  1964  and 
joined  the  chorus  chanting  that  the  coup  d'etat  of  the  "demo- 
cratic forces"  had  staved  off  the  hand  of  international  commu- 
nism. In  retrospect,  it  appears  that  the  only  foreign  hand 
involved  was  Washington's,  although  the  United  States  was  not 
the  principal  actor  in  these  events.  Indeed,  the  hard-liners  in 
the  Brazilian  military  pressured  Costa  e  Silva  into  promulgat- 
ing the  Fifth  Institutional  Act  on  December  13,  1968.  This  act 
gave  the  president  dictatorial  powers,  dissolved  Congress  and 
state  legislatures,  suspended  the  constitution,  and  imposed 
censorship. 

In  October  1969,  when  President  Costa  e  Silva  died  unex- 
pectedly, the  democratic  mask  fell  off  as  the  officer  corps  of  the 
three  services  consulted  among  themselves  to  pick  General 
Garrastazu  Medici  for  the  presidency.  Costa  e  Silva  and  Medici 
represented  the  hard-line,  antipolitics  segment  of  the  military, 
which  seemingly  was  content  to  hold  authority  as  long  as  neces- 
sary to  turn  Brazil  into  a  great  power.  The  Medici  government 
illustrated  how  it  was  possible  to  remain  in  power  without  pop- 
ular support,  without  a  political  party,  and  without  a  well- 
defined  program.  It  was  the  era  of  terrorist  actions  in  the  cities, 
replete  with  kidnappings  of  diplomats,  including  the  United 
States  ambassador,  and  an  extensive  antiguerrilla  campaign  in 
northern  Goias.  The  repressive  apparatus  expanded  into  vari- 
ous agencies,  which  spied  on  political  opponents  and  engaged 


80

in  dirty  tricks,  torture,  and  "disappearings"  (see  The  Military 
Role  in  the  Intelligence  Services,  ch.  5).  Those  operations 
caused  an  open  break  between  the  government  and  the  hierar- 
chy of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  for  the  first  time  in  Brazil- 
ian history.  They  also  produced  a  deterioration  in  relations 
with  the  United  States,  whose  leaders  had  expected  the  Castelo 
Branco  vision  of  the  revolution  to  win  out. 

The  Medici  administration  wrapped  itself  in  the  green  and 
gold  flag  when  Brazil  won  the  World  Cup  in  soccer  in  1970, 
began  to  build  the  Trans-Amazonian  Highway  through  the 
northern  rain  forests,  and  dammed  the  Rio  Parana,  creating 
the  world's  largest  hydroelectric  dam  at  Itaipu.  From  1968  to 
1974,  parallel  with  the  darkest  days  of  the  dictatorship,  the  mil- 
itary-civil technocratic  alliance  took  shape  as  the  economy 
boomed,  reaching  annual  GDP  growth  rates  of  12  percent.  It 
looked  as  if  Brazil's  dreams  of  full  industrialization  and  great- 
power  status  were  possible.  Sadly,  in  those  years  of  the  sup- 
posed "economic  miracles,"  criticism  and  labor  unrest  were 
suppressed  with  arrests,  torture,  and  censorship.  Moreover,  this 
apparent  success  of  mixing  authoritarian  rule  and  economic 
growth  encouraged  officers  in  Argentina,  Chile,  Bolivia,  and 
Uruguay  to  seize  power  in  their  countries. 

It  was  in  this  atmosphere  that  retired  General  Ernesto  Geisel 
(1974-79)  came  to  the  presidency  with  Medici's  approval. 
There  had  been  intense  behind-the-scenes  maneuvering  by  the 
hard-liners  against  him  and  by  the  more  moderate  supporters 
of  Castelo  Branco  for  him.  Fortunately  for  Geisel,  his  brother, 
Orlando  Geisel,  was  the  minister  of  army,  and  his  close  ally, 
General  Joao  Baptista  de  Oliveira  Figueiredo,  was  chief  of 
Medici's  military  staff. 

Although  not  immediately  understood  by  civilians,  Ernesto 
Geisel's  accession  signaled  a  move  away  from  repression  toward 
democratic  rule.  Geisel  replaced  several  regional  commanders 
with  trusted  officers  and  labeled  his  political  program  distensdo, 
meaning  a  gradual  relaxation  of  authoritarian  rule.  It  would 
be,  in  his  words,  "the  maximum  of  development  possible  with 
the  minimum  of  indispensable  security." 

President  Geisel  sought  to  maintain  high  economic  growth 
rates,  even  while  seeking  to  deal  with  the  effects  of  the  oil 
shocks.  He  kept  up  massive  investments  in  infrastructure — 
highways,  telecommunications,  hydroelectric  dams,  mineral 
extraction,  factories,  and  atomic  energy.  Fending  off  national- 
ist objections,  he  opened  Brazil  to  oil  prospecting  by  foreign 


81 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 


firms  for  the  first  time  since  the  early  1950s.  His  government 
borrowed  billions  of  dollars  to  see  Brazil  through  the  oil  crisis. 

Brazil  shifted  its  foreign  policy  to  meet  its  economic  needs. 
"Responsible  pragmatism"  replaced  strict  alignment  with  the 
United  States  and  a  worldview  based  on  ideological  frontiers 
and  blocs  of  nations.  Because  Brazil  was  80  percent  dependent 
on  imported  oil,  Geisel  shifted  the  country  from  a  pro-Israeli 
stance  to  closer  ties  with  oil-rich  Saudi  Arabia  and  Iraq.  His  gov- 
ernment also  recognized  China,  Angola,  and  Mozambique  and 
moved  closer  to  Spanish  America,  Europe,  and  Japan.  The 
1975  agreement  with  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West 
Germany)  to  build  nuclear  reactors  produced  confrontation 
with  the  Carter  administration.,  which  was  also  scolding  the  Gei- 
sel government  for  the  human  rights  abuses  that  it  was  fighting 
to  stop.  Frustrated  with  what  he  saw  as  United  States  highhand- 
edness and  lack  of  understanding,  Geisel  renounced  the  mili- 
tary alliance  with  the  United  States  in  April  1977. 

In  1977  and  1978,  the  succession  issue  caused  further  con- 
frontations with  the  hard-liners.  Noting  that  Brazil  was  only  a 
"relative  democracy,"  Geisel  attempted  in  April  1977  to  restrain 
the  growing  strength  of  the  opposition  parties  by  creating  an 
electoral  college  that  would  approve  his  selected  replacement. 
In  October  he  dismissed  the  far-right  minister  of  army,  General 
Sylvio  Cueto  Coelho  da  Frota.  In  1978  Geisel  maneuvered 
through  the  first  labor  strikes  since  1964  and  through  the 
repeated  electoral  victories  of  the  opposition  Brazilian  Demo- 
cratic Movement  (Movimento  Democratico  Brasileiro — 
MDB).  He  allowed  the  return  of  exiles,  restored  habeas  corpus, 
repealed  the  extraordinary  powers  decreed  by  the  Fifth  Institu- 
tional Act,  and  imposed  General  Joao  Figueiredo  (1979-85)  as 
his  successor  in  March  1979. 

The  last  military  president,  Joao  Figueiredo,  said  that  he 
took  over  the  presidency  more  out  of  a  sense  of  dun-  than  polit- 
ical ambition.  He  signed  a  general  amnesty  into  law  and  turned 
Geisel's  distensdo  into  a  gradual  abertura  (the  opening  of  the 
political  system),  saying  that  his  goal  was  "to  make  this  country 
a  democracy."  The  hard-liners  reacted  to  the  opening  with  a 
series  of  terrorist  bombings.  An  April  1981  bombing  incident 
confirmed  direct  military  involvement  in  terrorism,  but 
Figueiredo  proved  too  weak  to  punish  the  guilty.  The  incident 
and  the  regime's  inaction  strengthened  the  public's  resolve  to 
end  military  rule.  Moreover,  Fisoieiredo  faced  other  significant 


82

problems,  such  as  soaring  inflation,  declining  productivity,  and 
a  mounting  foreign  debt. 

Political  liberalization  and  the  declining  world  economy 
contributed  to  Brazil's  economic  and  social  problems.  In  1978 
and  1980,  huge  strikes  took  place  in  the  industrial  ring  around 
Sao  Paulo.  Protesters  asserted  that  wage  increases  indexed  to 
the  inflation  rate  were  far  below  a  livable  level.  Union  leaders, 
including  the  future  1990  presidential  candidate  Luis  "Lula" 
Inacio  da  Silva,  were  arrested  for  violation  of  national  security 
laws.  The  IMF  imposed  a  painful  austerity  program  on  Brazil. 
Under  that  program,  Brazil  was  required  to  hold  down  wages 
to  fight  inflation.  In  the  North,  Northeast,  and  even  in  rela- 
tively prosperous  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  rural  people  seized 
unused,  private  land,  forcing  the  government  to  create  a  new 
land  reform  ministry.  Tension  with  the  Roman  Catholic 
Church,  the  major  voice  for  societal  change,  peaked  in  the 
early  1980s  with  the  expulsion  of  foreign  priests  involved  in 
political  and  land  reform  issues. 

To  attack  the  soaring  debt,  Figueiredo's  administration 
stressed  exports — food,  natural  resources,  automobiles,  arms, 
clothing,  shoes,  even  electricity — and  expanded  petroleum 
exploration  by  foreign  companies.  In  foreign  relations,  the 
objective  was  to  establish  ties  with  any  country  that  would  con- 
tribute to  Brazilian  economic  development.  Washington  was 
kept  at  a  certain  distance,  and  the  North-South  dialogue  was 
emphasized. 

In  1983  the  economy  leaped  ahead  with  5.4  percent  GDP 
growth,  but  it  was  lost  in  the  rising  inflation  and  the  failure  of 
political  leadership.  Figueiredo's  heart  condition  led  to  bypass 
surgery  in  the  United  States,  removing  him  from  control  of  the 
situation.  In  an  impressive  display,  millions  of  Brazilians  took  to 
the  streets  in  all  the  major  cities  demanding  a  direct  vote  (dire- 
tasjdf)  in  the  choice  of  the  next  president.  In  April  1984,  Con- 
gress failed  to  achieve  the  necessary  numbers  to  give  the 
people  their  wish,  and  the  choice  was  left  to  an  electoral  col- 
lege. Figueiredo  did  not  act  forcefully  to  back  a  preference,  so 
it  became  a  scramble  as  candidates  pursued  the  collegial  votes. 

On  January  15,  1985,  the  electoral  college  elected  Tancredo 
Neves  of  Minas  Gerais,  Vargas's  minister  of  justice  in  the  1950s, 
and  former  federal  deputy,  senator,  and  prime  minister.  Neves 
was  a  sensible  politician  with  a  reputation  for  honesty.  How- 
ever, he  collapsed  the  night  before  his  inaugural,  and  the  presi- 
dency passed  to  Vice  President  Jose  Sarney  (president,  1985- 


83 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

90),  long-time  supporter  of  the  military  regime.  Neves  died  on 
April  21.  The  hopes  that  1985  would  be  a  quick  transition  to  a 
new  regime  faded  as  Brazilians  watched  this  turn  of  events  in  a 
state  of  shock.  Like  the  regime  changes  of  1822,  1889,  1930, 
1946,  and  1964,  the  1985  change  also  proved  to  be  long  and 
difficult  (see  Politics,  1985-96,  ch.  4).

Charles  Wagley's  An  Introduction  to  Brazil,  although  dated,  is 
still  valuable  for  an  understanding  of  Brazilian  history.  Darcy 
Ribeiro  provides  a  stimulating  overview  in  O  povo  brasileiro.  For 
an  examination  of  how  race  influenced  thought  and  national- 
ism, see  Thomas  E.  Skidmore's  Black  into  White.  E.  Bradford

THE  FIFTH  LARGEST  country  in  the  world,  Brazil  is  the  larg- 
est country  in  Latin  America  and  has  territory  slightly  larger 
than  that  of  the  continental  United  States.  Its  population,  esti- 
mated officially  at  nearly  160  million  in  mid-1997,  is  the  largest 
in  Latin  America  and  constitutes  about  half  of  the  population 
in  South  America.  With  80  percent  of  its  population  living  in 
cities  and  towns,  Brazil  is  one  of  the  most  urbanized  and  indus- 
trialized countries  in  Latin  America.  Sao  Paulo  and  Rio  de 
Janeiro  are  among  the  ten  largest  cities  in  the  world.  Sao  Paulo, 
with  its  18  million  people,  is  the  world's  third  largest  city,  after 
Mexico  City  and  Tokyo.  Yet,  parts  of  Brazil's  Amazon  region, 
which  has  some  of  the  world's  most  extensive  wilderness  areas, 
are  sparsely  inhabited  by  indigenous  peoples  still  in  the  process 
of  coming  into  contact  with  the  modern  world. 

More  than  for  its  superlatives,  however,  Brazil  stands  out  for 
its  regional  and  social  disparities.  Brazil  is  noted  for  having  one 
of  the  most  unequal  income  distributions  of  any  country.  In 
the  rural  Northeast  (Nordeste),  there  is  poverty  similar  to  that 
found  in  some  African  and  Asian  countries.  Although 
increased  urbanization  has  accompanied  economic  develop- 
ment, it  also  has  created  serious  social  problems  in  the  cities. 
Even  the  wealthiest  cities  contain  numerous  shantytowns  called 
favelas. 

While  in  many  ways  this  diversity  or  heterogeneity  makes  it 
similar  to  other  developing  countries  in  Latin  America  and 
elsewhere,  Brazil  is  also  unique.  One  of  the  fascinating  ele- 
ments of  this  uniqueness  is  that  it  is  different  things  at  once, 
presenting  different  faces  or  identities  of  a  single  coherent 
whole.  Both  local  and  foreign  perceptions  of  Brazil  tend  to 
exaggerate  particular  features,  lack  a  balanced  view,  and  fail  to 
grasp  how  the  parts  of  the  whole  fit  together.  During  the  twen- 
tieth century,  for  example,  Brazil  came  to  be  known  to  the  rest 
of  the  world  and  to  many  of  its  own  inhabitants  in  picturesque 
motifs  that  could  best  be  fit  together  coherently  in  terms  of  a 
"land  of  contrasts."  The  country  was  considered  a  tropical  para- 
dise famed  for  its  exports  (coffee),  music  (such  as  Carmen 
Miranda,  samba,  and  bossa  nova),  and  soccer  (thanks  to  Edson 
Arantes  do  Nascimento  (Pele)),  as  well  as  the  nearly  mythical 
Amazon  rain  forest.  Rio  de  Janeiro  was  associated  with  Sugar- 
loaf  (Pao  de  Acucar),  Copacabana,  income  tax  fugitives,  and 


89 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

even  the  mastermind  of  Britain's  "Great  Train  Robbery"  of 
1963.  On  a  more  serious  level,  Brazil  often  was  disparaged  for 
its  inability  to  solve  basic  political  and  economic  problems, 
such  as  consolidating  democratic  institutions,  controlling  run- 
away inflation,  and  servicing  the  foreign  debt.  However,  the 
nation  is  noted  for  being  an  emerging  industrial  power  and  for 
constructing  giant  public  works,  such  as  the  new  capital  city  of 
Brasilia,  the  Trans-Amazonian  Highway,  and  the  world's  largest 
hydroelectric  dam  (Itaipu).  Brazil  also  stands  out  for  its  leader- 
ship role  in  Latin  America  and  the  developing  world. 

Most  Brazilians  saw  the  military  regime  (1964-85)  as  a 
repressive  dictatorship,  although  others  regarded  it  as  having 
saved  the  country  from  communism.  Brazilian  society  was 
viewed  as  conservative  and  male  chauvinistic,  yet  simulta- 
neously freewheeling  or  even  licentious,  as  revealed  in  its  Car- 
naval  (Carnival)  festivities.  In  the  1980s,  much  of  the  world  saw 
the  Amazon,  the  world's  greatest  store  of  biodiversity,  and  its 
native  peoples  as  falling  victim  to  unparalleled  destruction.  In 
the  early  1990s,  the  news  of  massacres  of  Yanomami  Indians, 
street  children,  andfavela  dwellers  who  inhabit  Rio  de  Janeiro's 
hillsides  sundered  Brazil's  image  of  cordiality.  Although  there 
were  other  reasons  for  pessimism  and  a  continuing  identity  cri- 
sis (Brazil  became  the  first  democracy  to  impeach  its  president, 
in  December  1992),  there  were  reasons  for  pride  as  well  (infla- 
tion was  brought  under  control  in  1994).  Was  Brazil  a  "serious 
country"  destined  to  be  a  great  power,  or  was  it  always  to 
remain  a  land  of  the  future? 

One  can  find  ample  evidence  for  countervailing  trends: 
unity  and  diversity,  modernity  and  tradition,  progressive  gov- 
ernment policies  and  deeply  rooted  inequality,  tight  control  by 
elites  and  broadening  popular  participation,  principles  and 
pragmatism.  There  are  no  simple  answers.  This  chapter  exam- 
ines Brazil's  social  and  environmental  complexity  and  its  char- 
acteristic paradoxes  and  nuances  of  meaning,  beginning  with 
the  physical  setting  and  moving  into  the  more  mercurial  social 
issues,  with  special  attention  to  how  society  relates  to  nature. 

The  Physical  Setting 

Size  and  Location 

With  its  expansive  territory,  Brazil  occupies  most  of  the  east- 
ern part  of  the  South  American  continent  and  its  geographic 
heartland,  as  well  as  various  islands  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean.  The 


90 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


only  countries  in  the  world  that  are  larger  are  Russia,  Canada, 
China,  and  the  United  States  (including  Alaska).  The  national 
territory  extends  4,395  kilometers  from  north  to  south 
(5°16'20"  N  to  33°44'32M  S  latitude)  and  4,319  kilometers  from 
east  to  west  (34°47'30"  E  to  73°59'32"  W  longitude).  It  spans 
four  time  zones,  the  westernmost  of  which,  in  Acre  State,  is  the 
same  as  Eastern  Standard  Time  in  the  United  States.  The  time 
zone  of  the  capital  (Brasilia)  and  of  the  most  populated  part  of 
Brazil  along  the  east  coast  is  two  hours  ahead  of  Eastern  Stan- 
dard Time,  except  when  it  is  on  its  own  daylight  savings  time, 
from  October  to  February.  The  Atlantic  islands  are  in  the  east- 
ernmost time  zone. 

Brazil  possesses  the  archipelago  of  Fernando  de  Noronha, 
located  350  kilometers  northeast  of  its  "horn,"  and  several 
small  islands  and  atolls  in  the  Atlantic — Abrolhos,  Atol  das 
Rocas,  Penedos  de  Sao  Pedro  e  Sao  Paulo,  Trindade,  and  Mar- 
tini Vaz.  In  the  early  1970s,  Brazil  claimed  a  territorial  sea 
extending  362  kilometers  from  the  country's  shores,  including 
those  of  the  islands. 

On  Brazil's  east  coast,  the  Atlantic  coastline  extends  7,367 
kilometers.  In  the  west,  in  clockwise  order  from  the  south,  Bra- 
zil has  15,719  kilometers  of  borders  with  Uruguay,  Argentina, 
Paraguay,  Bolivia,  Peru,  Colombia,  Venezuela,  Guyana,  Suri- 
name,  and  French  Guiana  (see  table  2,  Appendix).  The  only 
South  American  countries  with  which  Brazil  does  not  share 
borders  are  Chile  and  Ecuador.  A  few  short  sections  are  in 
question,  but  there  are  no  major  boundary  controversies  with 
any  of  the  neighboring  countries. 

Geology,  Geomorphology,  and  Drainage 

In  contrast  to  the  Andes,  which  rose  to  elevations  of  nearly 
7,000  meters  in  a  relatively  recent  epoch  and  inverted  the  Ama- 
zon's direction  of  flow  from  westward  to  eastward,  Brazil's  geo- 
logical formation  is  very  old.  Precambrian  crystalline  shields 
cover  36  percent  of  the  territory,  especially  its  central  area.  The 
principal  mountain  ranges  average  elevations  just  under  2,000 
meters.  The  Serra  do  Mar  Range  hugs  the  Atlantic  coast,  and 
the  Serra  do  Espinhaco  Range,  the  largest  in  area,  extends 
through  the  south-central  part  of  the  country  (see  fig.  3).  The 
highest  mountains  are  in  the  Tumucumaque,  Pacaraima,  and 
Imeri  ranges,  among  others,  which  traverse  the  northern  bor- 
der with  the  Guianas  and  Venezuela.

In  addition  to  mountain  ranges  (about  0.5  percent  of  the 
country  is  above  1,200  meters),  Brazil's  Central  Highlands 
include  avast  central  plateau  (Planalto  Central).  The  plateau's 
uneven  terrain  has  an  average  elevation  of  1,000  meters.  The 
rest  of  the  territory  is  made  up  primarily  of  sedimentary  basins, 
the  largest  of  which  is  drained  by  the  Amazon  and  its  tributar- 
ies. Of  the  total  territory,  41  percent  averages  less  than  200 
meters  in  elevation.  The  coastal  zone  is  noted  for  thousands  of 
kilometers  of  tropical  beaches  interspersed  with  mangroves, 
lagoons,  and  dunes,  as  well  as  numerous  coral  reefs. 

Brazil  has  one  of  the  world's  most  extensive  river  systems, 
with  eight  major  drainage  basins,  all  of  which  drain  into  the 
Atlantic  Ocean.  Two  of  these  basins — the  Amazon  and 
Tocantins-Araguaia — account  for  more  than  half  the  total 
drainage  area.  The  largest  river  system  in  Brazil  is  the  Amazon, 
which  originates  in  the  Andes  and  receives  tributaries  from  a 
basin  that  covers  45.7  percent  of  the  country,  principally  the 
north  and  west.  The  main  Amazon  river  system  is  the  Amazo- 
nas-Solimoes-Ucayali  axis  (the  6,762  kilometer-long  Ucayali  is  a 
Peruvian  tributary),  flowing  from  west  to  east.  Through  the 
Amazon  Basin  flows  one-fifth  of  the  world's  fresh  water.  A  total 
of  3,615  kilometers  of  the  Amazon  are  in  Brazilian  territory. 
Over  this  distance,  the  waters  decline  only  about  100  meters. 
The  major  tributaries  on  the  southern  side  are,  from  west  to 
east,  the  Javari,  Jurua,  Purus  (all  three  of  which  flow  into  the 
western  section  of  the  Amazon  called  the  Solimoes),  Madeira, 
Tapajos,  Xingu,  and  Tocantins.  On  the  northern  side,  the  larg- 
est tributaries  are  the  Branco,  Japura,  Jari,  and  Negro.  The 
above-mentioned  tributaries  carry  more  water  than  the  Missis- 
sippi (its  discharge  is  less  than  one-tenth  that  of  the  Amazon) . 
The  Amazon  and  some  of  its  tributaries,  called  "white"  rivers, 
bear  rich  sediments  and  hydrobiological  elements.  The  black- 
white  and  clear  rivers — such  as  the  Negro,  Tapajos,  and 
Xingu — have  clear  (greenish)  or  dark  water  with  few  nutrients 
and  little  sediment. 

The  major  river  system  in  the  Northeast  is  the  Sao  Francisco, 
which  flows  1,609  kilometers  northeast  from  the  south-central 
region.  Its  basin  covers  7.6  percent  of  the  national  territory. 
Only  277  kilometers  of  the  lower  river  are  navigable  for  ocean- 
going ships.  The  Parana  system  covers  14.5  percent  of  the 
country.  The  Parana  flows  south  into  the  Rio  de  la  Plata  Basin, 
reaching  the  Atlantic  between  Argentina  and  Uruguay.  The 
headwaters  of  the  Paraguai,  the  Parana's  major  eastern  tribu- 


94 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


tary,  constitute  the  Pantanal,  the  largest  contiguous  wetlands  in 
the  world,  covering  as  much  as  230,000  square  kilometers. 

Below  their  descent  from  the  highlands,  many  of  the  tribu- 
taries of  the  Amazon  are  navigable.  Upstream,  they  generally 
have  rapids  or  waterfalls,  and  boats  and  barges  also  must  face 
sandbars,  trees,  and  other  obstacles.  Nevertheless,  the  Amazon 
is  navigable  by  oceangoing  vessels  as  far  as  3,885  kilometers 
upstream,  reaching  Iquitos  in  Peru.  The  Amazon  river  system 
was  the  principal  means  of  access  until  new  roads  became  more 
important  in  the  1970s.  The  Sao  Francisco  was  also  used  for 
transportation  in  the  past.  Dams  and  locks  in  the  Parana  system 
have  made  it  an  important  artery  for  interstate  and  interna- 
tional trade  in  the  1990s. 

The  various  river  systems  descending  from  the  shields  have 
endowed  Brazil  with  vast  hydroelectric  potential,  estimated  at 
129,046  megawatts  (MW),  of  which  30,065  MW  were  in  opera- 
tion or  under  construction  in  1991.  The  largest  hydroelectric 
projects  are  Itaipu,  in  Parana,  with  12,600  MW;  Tucurui,  in 
Para,  with  7,746  MW;  and  Paulo  Afonso,  in  Bahia,  with  3,986 
MW. 

Soils  and  Vegetation 

Brazil's  tropical  soils  produce  70  million  tons  of  grain  crops 
per  year,  but  this  output  is  attributed  more  to  their  extension 
than  their  fertility.  Despite  the  earliest  Portuguese  explorers' 
reports  that  the  land  was  exceptionally  fertile  and  that  any- 
thing planted  grew  well,  the  record  in  terms  of  sustained  agri- 
cultural productivity  has  been  generally  disappointing.  High 
initial  fertility  after  clearing  and  burning  usually  is  depleted 
rapidly,  and  acidity  and  aluminum  content  are  often  high. 
Together  with  the  rapid  growth  of  weeds  and  pests  in  cultivated 
areas,  as  a  result  of  high  temperatures  and  humidity,  this  loss  of 
fertility  explains  the  westward  movement  of  the  agricultural 
frontier  and  slash-and-burn  agriculture  (see  Glossary);  it  takes 
less  investment  in  work  or  money  to  clear  new  land  than  to 
continue  cultivating  the  same  land.  Burning  also  is  used  tradi- 
tionally to  remove  tall,  dry,  and  nutrient-poor  grass  from  pas- 
ture at  the  end  of  the  dry  season.  Until  mechanization  and  the 
use  of  chemical  and  genetic  inputs  increased  during  the  agri- 
cultural intensification  period  of  the  1970s  and  1980s,  coffee 
planting  and  farming  in  general  moved  constantly  onward  to 
new  lands  in  the  west  and  north.  This  pattern  of  horizontal  or 
extensive  expansion  maintained  low  levels  of  technology  and

productivity  and  placed  emphasis  oh  quantity  rather  than  qual- 
ity of  agricultural  production. 

The  largest  areas  of  fertile  soils,  called  terra  roxa  (red  earth), 
are  found  in  the  states  of  Parana  and  Sao  Paulo.  The  least  fer- 
tile areas  are  in  the  Amazon,  where  the  dense  rain  forest  is. 
Soils  in  the  Northeast  are  often  fertile,  but  they  lack  water, 
unless  they  are  irrigated  artificially. 

In  the  1980s,  investments  made  possible  the  use  of  irriga- 
tion, especially  in  the  Northeast  Region  and  in  Rio  Grande  do 
Sul  State,  which  had  shifted  from  grazing  to  soy  and  rice  pro- 
duction in  the  1970s.  Savanna  soils  also  were  made  usable  for 
soybean  farming  through  acidity  correction,  fertilization,  plant 
breeding,  and  in  some  cases  spray  irrigation.  As  agriculture 
underwent  modernization  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  soil  fertility 
became  less  important  for  agricultural  production  than  factors 
related  to  capital  investment,  such  as  infrastructure,  mechani- 
zation, use  of  chemical  inputs,  breeding,  and  proximity  to  mar- 
kets. Consequently,  the  vigor  of  frontier  expansion  weakened. 

The  variety  of  climates,  soils,  and  drainage  conditions  in  Bra- 
zil is  reflected  in  the  range  of  its  vegetation  types.  The  Amazon 
Basin  and  the  areas  of  heavy  rainfall  along  the  Atlantic  coast 
have  tropical  rain  forest  composed  of  broadleaf  evergreen 
trees.  The  rain  forest  may  contain  as  many  as  3,000  species  of 
flora  and  fauna  within  a  2.6-square-kilometer  area.  The  Atlan- 
tic Forest  is  reputed  to  have  even  greater  biological  diversity 
than  the  Amazon  rain  forest,  which,  despite  apparent  homoge- 
neity, contains  many  types  of  vegetation,  from  high  canopy  for- 
est to  bamboo  groves. 

In  the  semiarid  Northeast,  caatinga,  a  dry,  thick,  thorny  vege- 
tation, predominates.  Most  of  central  Brazil  is  covered  with  a 
woodland  savanna,  known  as  the  cerrado  (sparse  scrub  trees  and 
drought-resistant  grasses),  which  became  an  area  of  agricul- 
tural development  after  the  mid-1970s.  In  the  South  (Sul),  nee- 
dle-leaved pinewoods  (Parana  pine  or  araucaria)  cover  the 
highlands;  grassland  similar  to  the  Argentine  pampa  covers  the 
sea-level  plains.  The  Mato  Grosso  swamplands  (Pantanal  Mato- 
grossense)  is  a  Florida-sized  plain  in  the  western  portion  of  the 
Center- West  (Centro-Oeste) .  It  is  covered  with  tall  grasses, 
bushes,  and  widely  dispersed  trees  similar  to  those  of  the  cer- 
rado and  is  partly  submerged  during  the  rainy  season. 

Brazil,  which  is  named  after  reddish  dyewood  (pau  brasil), 
has  long  been  famous  for  the  wealth  of  its  tropical  forests. 
These  are  not,  however,  as  important  to  world  markets  as  those

of  Asia  and  Africa,  which  started  to  reach  depletion  only  in  the 
1980s.  By  1996  more  than  90  percent  of  the  original  Atlantic 
forest  had  been  cleared,  primarily  for  agriculture,  with  little 
use  made  of  the  wood,  except  for  araucaria  pine  in  Parana. 

The  inverse  situation  existed  with  regard  to  clearing  for 
wood  in  the  Amazon  rain  forest,  of  which  about  15  percent  had 
been  cleared  by  1994,  and  part  of  the  remainder  had  been  dis- 
turbed by  selective  logging.  Because  the  Amazon  forest  is 
highly  heterogeneous,  with  hundreds  of  woody  species  per 
hectare,  there  is  considerable  distance  between  individual  trees 
of  economic  value,  such  as  mahogany  and  cerejeira.  Therefore, 
this  type  of  forest  is  not  normally  cleared  for  Umber  extraction 
but  logged  through  high-grading,  or  selection  of  the  most  valu- 
able trees.  Because  of  vines,  felling,  and  transportation,  their 
removal  causes  destruction  of  many  other  trees,  and  the  litter 
and  new  growth  create  a  risk  of  forest  fires,  which  are  otherwise 
rare  in  rain  forests.  In  favorable  locations,  such  as  Paragomi- 
nas,  in  the  northeastern  part  of  Para  State,  a  new  pattern  of 
timber  extraction  has  emerged:  diversification  and  the  produc- 
tion of  plywood  have  led  to  the  economic  use  of  more  than  100 
tree  species. 

Starting  in  the  late  1980s,  rapid  deforestation  and  extensive 
burning  in  Brazil  received  considerable  international  and 
national  attention.  Satellite  images  have  helped  document  and 
quantify  deforestation  as  well  as  fires,  but  their  use  also  has 
generated  considerable  controversy  because  of  problems  of 
defining  original  vegetation,  cloud  cover,  and  dealing  with  sec- 
ondary growth  and  because  fires,  as  mentioned  above,  may 
occur  in  old  pasture  rather  than  signifying  new  clearing.  Public 
policies  intended  to  promote  sustainable  management  of  tim- 
ber extraction,  as  well  as  sustainable  use  of  nontimber  forest 
products  (such  as  rubber,  Brazil  nuts,  fruits,  seeds,  oils,  and 
vines),  were  being  discussed  intensely  in  the  mid-1990s.  How- 
ever, implementing  the  principles  of  sustainable  development 
(see  Glossary),  without  irreversible  damage  to  the  environ- 
ment, proved  to  be  more  challenging  than  establishing  inter- 
national agreements  about  them. 

Climate 

Although  90  percent  of  the  country  is  within  the  tropical 
zone,  the  climate  of  Brazil  varies  considerably  from  the  mostly 
tropical  North  (the  equator  traverses  the  mouth  of  the  Ama- 
zon) to  temperate  zones  below  the  Tropic  of  Capricorn  (23°27' 


97 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

S  latitude),  which  crosses  the  country  at  the  latitude  of  the  city 
of  Sao  Paulo.  Brazil  has  five  climatic  regions — equatorial,  tropi- 
cal, semiarid,  highland  tropical,  and  subtropical. 

Temperatures  along  the  equator  are  high,  averaging  above 
25°C,  but  not  reaching  the  summer  extremes  of  up  to  40°C  in 
the  temperate  zones.  There  is  little  seasonal  variation  near  the 
equator,  although  at  times  it  can  get  cool  enough  for  wearing  a 
jacket,  especially  in  the  rain.  At  the  country's  other  extreme, 
there  are  frosts  south  of  the  Tropic  of  Capricorn  during  the 
winter  (June-August),  and  in  some  years  there  is  snow  in  the 
mountainous  areas,  such  as  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  and  Santa  Cata- 
rina.  Temperatures  in  the  cities  of  Sao  Paulo,  Belo  Horizonte, 
and  Brasilia  are  moderate  (usually  between  15°C  and  30°C), 
despite  their  relatively  low  latitude,  because  of  their  elevation 
of  approximately  1,000  meters.  Rio  de  Janeiro,  Recife,  and  Sal- 
vador on  the  coast  have  warm  climates,  with  average  tempera- 
tures ranging  from  23°C  to  27°C,  but  enjoy  constant  trade 
winds.  The  southern  cities  of  Porto  Alegre  and  Curitiba  have  a 
subtropical  climate  similar  to  that  in  parts  of  the  United  States 
and  Europe,  and  temperatures  can  fall  below  freezing  in  win- 
ter. 

Precipitation  levels  vary  widely.  Most  of  Brazil  has  moderate 
rainfall  of  between  1,000  and  1,500  millimeters  a  year,  with 
most  of  the  rain  falling  in  the  summer  (between  December  and 
April)  south  of  the  Equator.  The  Amazon  region  is  notoriously 
humid,  with  rainfall  generally  more  than  2,000  millimeters  per 
year  and  reaching  as  high  as  3,000  millimeters  in  parts  of  the 
western  Amazon  and  near  Belem.  It  is  less  widely  known  that, 
despite  high  annual  precipitation,  the  Amazon  rain  forest  has  a 
three-  to  five-month  dry  season,  the  timing  of  which  varies 
according  to  location  north  or  south  of  the  equator. 

High  and  relatively  regular  levels  of  precipitation  in  the 
Amazon  contrast  sharply  with  the  dryness  of  the  semiarid 
Northeast,  where  rainfall  is  scarce  and  there  are  severe 
droughts  in  cycles  averaging  seven  years.  The  Northeast  is  the 
driest  part  of  the  country.  The  region  also  constitutes  the  hot- 
test part  of  Brazil,  where  during  the  dry  season  between  May 
and  November,  temperatures  of  more  than  38°C  have  been 
recorded.  However,  the  sertdo,  a  region  of  semidesert  vegeta- 
tion used  primarily  for  low-density  ranching,  turns  green  when 
there  is  rain.  Most  of  the  Center-West  has  1,500  to  2,000  milli- 
meters of  rain  per  year,  with  a  pronounced  dry  season  in  the 
middle  of  the  year,  while  the  South  and  most  of  the  Atlantic

coast  as  far  north  as  Salvador,  Bahia,  in  the  Northeast,  have  sim- 
ilar amounts  of  rainfall  without  a  distinct  dry  season. 

Geographic  Regions 

Brazil's  twenty-six  states  and  the  Federal  District  (Distrito 
Federal)  are  divided  conventionally  into  five  regions — North 
(Norte),  Northeast,  Southeast  (Sudeste),  South,  and  Center- 
West  (see  fig.  4).  In  1996  there  were  5,581  municipalities 
(municipios) ,  which  have  municipal  governments.  Many  munic- 
ipalities, which  are  comparable  to  United  States  counties,  are 
in  turn  divided  into  districts  (distritos),  which  do  not  have  polit- 
ical or  administrative  autonomy.  In  1995  there  were  9,274  dis- 
tricts. All  municipal  and  district  seats,  regardless  of  size,  are 
considered  officially  to  be  urban.  For  purely  statistical  pur- 
poses, the  municipalities  were  grouped  in  1990  into  559  micro- 
regions,  which  in  turn  constituted  136  meso-regions.  This 
grouping  modified  the  previous  micro-regional  division  estab- 
lished in  1968,  a  division  that  was  used  to  present  census  data 
for  1970,  1975,  1980,  and  1985. 

Each  of  the  five  major  regions  has  a  distinct  ecosystem. 
Administrative  boundaries  do  not  necessarily  coincide  with 
ecological  boundaries,  however.  In  addition  to  differences  in 
physical  environment,  patterns  of  economic  activity  and  popu- 
lation settlement  vary  widely  among  the  regions.  The  principal 
ecological  characteristics  of  each  of  the  five  major  regions,  as 
well  as  their  principal  socioeconomic  and  demographic  fea- 
tures, are  summarized  below. 

North 

The  equatorial  North,  also  known  as  the  Amazon  or 
Amazonia,  includes,  from  west  to  east,  the  states  of  Rondonia, 
Acre,  Amazonas,  Roraima,  Para,  Amapa,  and,  as  of  1988, 
Tocantins  (created  from  the  northern  part  of  Goias  State, 
which  is  situated  in  the  Center-West).  Rondonia,  previously  a 
federal  territory,  became  a  state  in  1986.  The  former  federal 
territories  of  Roraima  and  Amapa  were  raised  to  statehood  in 
1988. 

With  3,869,638  square  kilometers,  the  North  is  the  country's 
largest  region,  covering  45.3  percent  of  the  national  territory 
(see  table  3,  Appendix).  The  region's  principal  biome  is  the 
humid  tropical  forest,  also  known  as  the  rain  forest,  home  to 
some  of  the  planet's  richest  biological  diversity.  The  North  has 
served  as  a  source  of  forest  products  ranging  from  "backlands

drugs"  (such  as  sarsaparilla,  cocoa,  cinnamon,  and  turtle  but- 
ter) in  the  colonial  period  to  rubber  and  Brazil  nuts  in  more 
recent  times.  In  the  mid-twentieth  century,  nonforest  products 
from  mining,  farming,  and  livestock-raising  became  more 
important,  and  in  the  1980s  the  lumber  industry  boomed.  In 
1990,  6.6  percent  of  the  region's  territory  was  considered 
altered  by  anthropic  (man-made)  action,  with  state  levels  vary- 
ing from  0.9  percent  in  Amapa  to  14.0  percent  in  Rondonia.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


In  1996  the  North  had  11.1  million  inhabitants,  only  7  per- 
cent of  the  national  total.  However,  its  share  of  Brazil's  total 
had  grown  rapidly  in  the  1970s  and  early  1980s  as  a  result  of 
interregional  migration,  as  well  as  high  rates  of  natural 
increase.  The  largest  population  concentrations  are  in  eastern 
Para  State  and  in  Rondonia.  The  major  cities  are  Belem  and 
Santarem  in  Para,  and  Manaus  in  Amazonas.  Living  standards 
are  below  the  national  average.  The  highest  per  capita  income, 
US$2,888,  in  the  region  in  1994,  was  in  Amazonas,  while  the 
lowest,  US$901,  was  in  Tocantins. 

Northeast 

The  nine  states  that  make  up  the  Northeast  are  Alagoas, 
Bahia,  Ceara,  Maranhao,  Paraiba,  Pernambuco,  Piauf,  Rio 
Grande  do  Norte,  and  Sergipe.  The  former  federal  territory  of 
Fernando  de  Noronha  was  incorporated  into  Pernambuco 
State  in  1988.  For  planning  or  ecological  purposes,  Maranhao 
west  of  44°  W  longitude,  most  of  which  until  recently  was  cov- 
ered with  "pre-Amazon"  forest  (that  is,  transition  from  the 
cerrado  or  caatinga  to  tropical  forest),  is  often  included  in  the 
Amazon  region. 

The  Northeast,  with  1,561,178  square  kilometers,  covers  18.3 
percent  of  the  national  territory.  Its  principal  biome  is  the 
semiarid  caatinga  region,  which  is  subject  to  prolonged  peri- 
odic droughts.  By  the  1990s,  this  region  utilized  extensive  irri- 
gation. In  an  area  known  as  the  forest  zone  (zona  da  mata),  the 
Atlantic  Forest,  now  almost  entirely  gone,  once  stretched  along 
the  coastline  as  far  north  as  Rio  Grande  do  Norte.  Sugar  plan- 
tations established  there  in  colonial  times  persisted  for  centu- 
ries. Between  the  mata  and  the  sertao  lies  a  transition  zone 
called  the  agreste,  an  area  of  mixed  farming.  In  1988-89,  46.3 
percent  of  the  region  had  been  subjected  to  anthropic  activity, 
ranging  from  a  low  of  10.8  percent  in  Maranhao  to  a  high  of 
77.2  percent  in  Alagoas. 

Because  its  high  rates  of  natural  increase  offset  heavy  out- 
migration,  the  Northeast's  large  share  of  the  country's  total 
population  declined  only  slightly  during  the  twentieth  century. 
In  1996  the  region  had  45  million  inhabitants,  28  percent  of 
Brazil's  total  population.  The  population  is  densest  along  the 
coast,  where  eight  of  the  nine  state  capitals  are  located,  but  is 
also  spread  throughout  the  interior.  The  major  cities  are  Salva- 
dor, in  Bahia;  Recife,  in  Pernambuco;  and  Fortaleza,  in  Ceara. 
The  region  has  the  country's  largest  concentration  of  rural 


101

population,  and  its  living  standards  are  the  lowest  in  Brazil.  In 
1994  Piauf  had  the  lowest  per  capita  income  in  the  region  and 
the  country,  only  US$835,  while  Sergipe  had  the  highest  aver- 
age income  in  the  region,  with  US$1,958. 

Southeast 

The  Southeast  consists  of  the  four  states  of  Espfrito  Santo, 
Minas  Gerais,  Rio  de  Janeiro,  and  Sao  Paulo.  Its  total  area  of 
927,286  square  kilometers  corresponds  to  10.9  percent  of  the 
national  territory.  The  region  has  the  largest  share  of  the  coun- 
try's population,  63  million  in  1991,  or  39  percent  of  the 
national  total,  primarily  as  a  result  of  internal  migration  since 
the  mid-nineteenth  century  until  the  1980s.  In  addition  to  a 
dense  urban  network,  it  contains  the  megacities  of  Sao  Paulo 
and  Rio  de  Janeiro,  which  in  1991  had  18.7  million  and  11.7 
million  inhabitants  in  their  metropolitan  areas,  respectively. 
The  region  combines  the  highest  living  standards  in  Brazil  with 
pockets  of  urban  poverty.  In  1994  Sao  Paulo  boasted  an  average 
income  of  US$4,666,  while  Minas  Gerais  reported  only 
US$2,833. 

Originally,  the  principal  biome  in  the  Southeast  was  the 
Atlantic  Forest,  but  by  1990  less  than  10  percent  of  the  original 
forest  cover  remained  as  a  result  of  clearing  for  farming,  ranch- 
ing, and  charcoal  making.  Anthropic  activity  had  altered  79.5 
percent  of  the  region,  ranging  from  75  percent  in  Minas  Gerais 
to  91.1  percent  in  Espfrito  Santo.  The  region  has  most  of  Bra- 
zil's industrial  production.  The  state  of  Sao  Paulo  alone 
accounts  for  half  of  the  country's  industries.  Agriculture,  also 
very  strong,  has  diversified  and  now  uses  modern  technology. 

South 

The  three  states  in  the  temperate  South — Parana,  Rio 
Grande  do  Sul,  and  Santa  Catarina — cover  577,214  square  kilo- 
meters, or  6.8  percent  of  the  national  territory.  The  population 
of  the  South  in  1991  was  23.1  million,  or  14  percent  of  the 
country's  total.  The  region  is  almost  as  densely  settled  as  the 
Southeast,  but  the  population  is  more  concentrated  along  the 
coast.  The  major  cities  are  Curitiba  and  Porto  Alegre.  The 
inhabitants  of  the  South  enjoy  relatively  high  living  standards. 
Because  of  its  industry  and  agriculture,  Parana  had  the  highest 
average  income  in  1994,  US$3,674,  while  Santa  Catarina,  a 
land  of  small  farmers  and  small  industries,  had  slightly  less, 
US$3,405. 


102 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


In  addition  to  the  Atlantic  Forest  and  pine  woods,  much  of 
which  were  cleared  in  the  post-World  War  II  period,  the  South 
contains  pampa  grasslands,  similar  to  those  of  Argentina  and 
Uruguay,  in  the  extreme  south.  In  1982,  83.5  percent  of  the 
region  had  been  altered  by  anthropic  activity,  with  the  highest 
level  (89.7  percent)  in  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  and  the  lowest  (66.7 
percent)  in  Santa  Catarina.  Agriculture — much  of  which,  such 
as  rice  production,  is  carried  out  by  small  farmers — has  high 
levels  of  productivity.  There  are  also  some  important  indus- 
tries. 

Center-West 

The  Center-West  consists  of  the  states  of  Goias,  Mato  Grosso, 
and  Mato  Grosso  do  Sul  (separated  from  Mato  Grosso  in 
1979),  as  well  as  the  Federal  District,  site  of  Brasilia,  the 
national  capital.  Until  1988  Goias  State  included  the  area  that 
then  became  the  state  of  Tocantins  in  the  North. 

The  Center-West  has  1,612,077  square  kilometers  and  covers 
18.9  percent  of  the  national  territory.  Its  main  biome  is  the 
cerrado,  the  tropical  savanna  in  which  natural  grassland  is  partly 
covered  with  twisted  shrubs  and  small  trees.  The  cerrado  was 
used  for  low-density  cattle-raising  in  the  past  but  is  now  also 
used  for  soybean  production.  There  are  gallery  forests  along 
the  rivers  and  streams  and  some  larger  areas  of  forest,  most  of 
which  have  been  cleared  for  farming  and  livestock.  In  the 
north,  the  cerrado  blends  into  tropical  forest.  It  also  includes 
the  Pantanal  wetlands  in  the  west,  known  for  their  wildlife, 
especially  aquatic  birds  and  caymans.  In  the  early  1980s,  33.6 
percent  of  the  region  had  been  altered  by  anthropic  activities, 
with  a  low  of  9.3  percent  in  Mato  Grosso  and  a  high  of  72.9  per- 
cent in  Goias  (not  including  Tocantins).  In  1996  the  Center- 
West  region  had  10.2  million  inhabitants,  or  6  percent  of  Bra- 
zil's total  population.  The  average  density  is  low,  with  concen- 
trations in  and  around  the  cities  of  Brasilia,  Goiania,  Campo 
Grande,  and  Cuiaba.  Living  standards  are  below  the  national 
average.  In  1994  they  were  highest  in  the  Federal  District,  with 
per  capita  income  of  US$7,089  (the  highest  in  the  nation),  and 
lowest  in  Mato  Grosso,  with  US$2,268. 

The  Environment 

The  environmental  problem  that  attracted  most  interna- 
tional attention  in  Brazil  in  the  1980s  was  undoubtedly  defores- 
tation in  the  Amazon.  Of  all  Latin  American  countries,  Brazil 


103 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

still  has  the  largest  portion  (66  percent)  of  its  territory  covered 
by  forests,  but  clearing  and  burning  in  the  Amazon  proceeded 
at  alarming  rates  in  the  1970s  and  1980s.  Most  of  the  clearing 
resulted  from  the  activities  of  ranchers,  including  large  corpo- 
rate operations,  and  a  smaller  portion  resulted  from  slash-and- 
burn  techniques  used  by  small  farmers. 

Deforestation  in  the  Amazon  declined  from  levels  averaging 
22,000  square  kilometers  per  year  during  the  1970-88  period 
to  about  11,000  square  kilometers  per  year  between  1988  and 
1991.  There  was  controversy  about  the  levels  in  the  mid-1990s. 
Knowledgeable  experts  placed  the  level  of  accumulated  defor- 
estation at  about  15  percent  in  1996,  as  opposed  to  12  percent 
in  1991.  Although  unseasonal  rainfall  patterns  may  explain 
some  year-to-year  variation,  the  basic  cause  for  the  decline  in 
deforestation  after  1987  was  economic  crisis.  There  was  insuffi- 
cient capital,  credit,  or  incentive  for  large-scale  clearing,  as  well 
as  insufficient  public  investment  to  stimulate  new  migration. 
Migration  to  the  Amazon  also  fell  quickly  in  the  late  1980s. 
More  effective  enforcement  of  government  regulations  and 
bad  publicity  for  large  offenders,  both  of  which  were  associated 
with  changes  in  public  opinion  about  the  environment,  also 
played  a  part.  Technical  changes  involved  in  the  transition 
from  horizontal  expansion  of  agriculture  to  increasing  produc- 
tivity also  accounted  for  decreasing  rates  of  deforestation. 

Desertification,  another  important  environmental  problem 
in  Brazil,  only  received  international  attention  following  the 
United  Nations  Conference  on  the  Environment  and  Develop- 
ment, also  known  as  the  Earth  Summit,  held  in  Rio  de  Janeiro 
in  June  1992.  Desertification  means  that  the  soils  and  vegeta- 
tion of  drylands  are  severely  degraded,  not  necessarily  that 
land  turns  into  desert.  In  the  early  1990s,  it  became  evident 
that  the  semi  arid  caatinga  ecosystem  of  the  Northeast  was  los- 
ing its  natural  vegetation  through  clearing  and  that  the  zone 
was  therefore  running  the  risk  of  becoming  even  more  arid,  as 
was  occurring  also  in  some  other  regions. 

In  areas  where  agriculture  is  more  intense  and  developed, 
there  are  serious  problems  of  soil  erosion,  siltation  and  sedi- 
mentation of  streams  and  rivers,  and  pollution  with  pesticides. 
In  parts  of  the  savannas,  where  irrigated  soybean  production 
expanded  in  the  1980s,  the  water  table  has  been  affected. 
Expansion  of  pastures  for  cattle-raising  has  reduced  natural 
biodiversity  in  the  savannas.  Swine  effluents  constitute  a  serious 
environmental  problem  in  Santa  Catarina  in  the  South.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


In  urban  areas,  at  least  in  the  largest  cities,  levels  of  air  pollu- 
tion and  congestion  are  typical  of,  or  worse  than,  those  found 
in  cities  in  developed  countries.  At  the  same  time,  however, 
basic  environmental  problems  related  to  the  lack  of  sanitation, 
which  developed  countries  solved  long  ago,  persist  in  Brazil. 
These  problems  are  sometimes  worse  in  middle-sized  and  small 
cities  than  in  large  cities,  which  have  more  resources  to  deal 
with  them.  Environmental  problems  of  cities  and  towns  finally 
began  to  receive  greater  attention  by  society  and  the  govern- 
ment in  the  1990s. 

According  to  many  critics,  the  economic  crisis  in  the  1980s 
worsened  environmental  degradation  in  Brazil  because  it  led  to 
over  exploitation  of  natural  resources,  stimulated  settlement  in 
fragile  lands  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas,  and  weakened  envi- 
ronmental protection.  At  the  same  time,  however,  the  lower 
level  of  economic  activity  may  have  reduced  pressure  on  the 
environment,  such  as  the  aforementioned  decreased  level  of 
investment  in  large-scale  clearing  in  the  Amazon.  That  pres- 
sure could  increase  if  economic  growth  accelerates,  especially 
if  consumption  patterns  remain  unchanged  and  more  sustain- 
able forms  of  production  are  not  found. 

In  Brazil  public  policies  regarding  the  environment  are  gen- 
erally advanced,  although  their  implementation  and  the 
enforcement  of  environmental  laws  have  been  far  from  ideal. 
Laws  regarding  forests,  water,  and  wildlife  have  been  in  effect 
since  the  1930s.  Brazil  achieved  significant  institutional 
advances  in  environmental  policy  design  and  implementation 
after  the  Stockholm  Conference  on  the  Environment  in  1972. 
Specialized  environmental  agencies  were  organized  at  the  fede- 
ral level  and  in  some  states,  and  many  national  parks  and 
reserves  were  established.  By  1992  Brazil  had  established  thirty- 
four  national  parks  and  fifty-six  biological  reserves  (see  fig.  5). 
In  1981  the  National  Environment  Policy  was  defined,  and  the 
National  System  for  the  Environment  (Sistema  Nacional  do 
Meio  Ambiente — Sisnama)  was  created,  with  the  National  Envi- 
ronmental Council  (Conselho  Nacional  do  Meio  Ambiente— 
Conama)  at  its  apex,  municipal  councils  at  its  base,  and  state- 
level  councils  in  between.  In  addition  to  government  authori- 
ties, all  of  these  councils  include  representatives  of  civil  society. 

The  1988  constitution  incorporates  environmental  precepts 
that  are  advanced  compared  with  those  of  most  other  coun- 
tries. At  that  time,  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  (Camara  dos  Dep- 
utados)  established  its  permanent  Commission  for  Defense  of

the  Consumer,  the  Environment,  and  Minorities.  In  1989  the 
creation  of  the  Brazilian  Institute  for  the  Environment  and 
Renewable  Natural  Resources  (Instituto  Brasileiro  do  Meio 
Ambiente  e  dos  Recursos  Naturais  Renovaveis — Ibama)  joined 
together  the  federal  environment  secretariat  and  the  federal 
agencies  specializing  in  forestry,  rubber,  and  fisheries.  In  1990 
the  administration  of  Fernando  Collor  de  Mello  (president, 
1990-92)  appointed  the  well-known  environmentalist  Jose 
Lutzemberger  as  secretary  of  the  environment  and  took  firm 
positions  on  the  environment  and  on  Indian  lands.  In  1992 
Brazil  played  a  key  role  at  the  Earth  Summit,  not  only  as  its  host 
but  also  as  negotiator  on  sustainable  development  agreements, 
including  the  conventions  on  climate  and  biodiversity.  The 
Ministry  of  Environment  was  created  in  late  1992,  after  Presi- 
dent Collor  had  left  office.  In  August  1993,  it  became  the  Min- 
istry of  Environment  and  the  Legal  Amazon  and  took  a  more 
pragmatic  approach  than  had  the  combative  Lutzemberger. 
However,  because  of  turnover  in  its  leadership,  a  poorly 
defined  mandate,  and  lack  of  funds,  its  role  and  impact  were 
limited.  In  1995  its  mandate  and  name  were  expanded  to 
include  water  resources — the  Ministry  of  Environment, 
Hydraulic  Resources,  and  the  Legal  Amazon — it  began  a  pro- 
cess of  restructuring  to  meet  its  mandate  of  "shared  manage- 
ment of  the  sustainable  use  of  natural  resources."  In  1997  the 
Commission  on  Policies  for  Sustainable  Development  and 
Agenda  21  began  to  function  under  the  aegis  of  the  Civil 
Household.  One  of  its  main  tasks  was  to  prepare  Agenda  21  (a 
plan  for  the  twenty-first  century)  for  Brazil  and  to  stimulate 
preparation  of  state  and  local  agendas. 

Institutional  development  at  the  official  level  was  accompa- 
nied and  in  part  stimulated  by  the  growth,  wide  diffusion,  and 
growing  professional  development  of  nongovernmental  orga- 
nizations (NGOs)  dedicated  to  environmental  and  socio-envi- 
ronmental  causes.  The  hundreds  of  NGOs  throughout  Brazil 
produce  documents  containing  both  useful  information  and 
passionate  criticisms.  Among  the  Brazilian  environmental 
NGOs,  the  most  visible  are  SOS  Atlantic  Forest  (SOS  Mata 
Atlantica),  the  Social-Environmental  Institute  (Instituto  Socio- 
Ambiental — ISA) ,  the  Pro-Nature  Foundation  (Fundacao  Pro- 
Natureza — Funatura),  and  the  Amazon  Working  Group 
(Grupo  de  Trabalho  Amazonico — GTA).  The  Brazilian  Forum 
of  NGOs  and  Social  Movements  for  the  Environment  and 
Development  and  the  Brazilian  Association  of  Nongovernmen- 


107 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

tal  Organizations  (Associacao  Brasileira  de  Organizacoes  Nao 
Governamentais — ABONG)  are  national  networks,  and  there 
are  various  regional  and  thematic  networks  as  well.  The  main 
international  environmental  NGOs  that  have  offices  or  affili- 
ates in  Brazil  are  the  World  Wildlife  Fund  (WWF),  Conserva- 
tion International  (CI),  and  Nature  Conservancy. 

Especially  after  the  events  of  the  late  1980s,  international 
organizations  and  developed  countries  have  allocated  signifi- 
cant resources  for  the  environmental  sector  in  Brazil.  In  1992 
environmental  projects  worth  about  US$6.8  million  were  iden- 
tified, with  US$2.6  in  counterpart  funds  (funds  provided  by  the 
Brazilian  government) .  More  than  70  percent  of  the  total  value 
was  for  sanitation,  urban  pollution  control,  and  other  urban 
environmental  projects.  Thus,  the  allocation  of  resources  did 
not  accord  with  the  common  belief  that  funding  was  influ- 
enced unduly  by  alarmist  views  on  deforestation  in  the  Ama- 
zon. 

Among  the  specific  environmental  projects  with  interna- 
tional support,  the  most  important  was  the  National  Environ- 
mental Plan  (Piano  Nacional  do  Meio  Ambiente — PNMA), 
which  received  a  US$117  million  loan  from  the  World  Bank 
(see  Glossary).  The  National  Environmental  Fund  (Fundo 
Nacional  do  Meio  Ambiente — FNMA),  in  addition  to  budget- 
ary funds,  received  US$20  million  from  the  Inter-American 
Development  Bank  (see  Glossary)  to  finance  the  environmen- 
tal activities  of  NGOs  and  small  municipal  governments.  The 
Pilot  Program  for  the  Conservation  of  the  Brazilian  Rain  For- 
ests (Programa  Piloto  para  a  Protecao  das  Florestas  Tropicais 
do  Brasil — PPG-7)  was  supported  by  the  world's  seven  richest 
countries  (the  so-called  G— 7)  and  the  European  Community 
(see  Glossary),  which  allocated  US$258  million  for  projects  in 
the  Amazon  and  Atlantic  Forest  regions.  The  Global  Environ- 
ment Facility  (GEF),  created  in  1990,  set  aside  US$30  million 
for  Brazil,  part  of  which  is  managed  by  a  national  fund  called 
Funbio.  GEF  also  established  a  small  grants  program  for  NGOs, 
which  focused  on  the  cerrado  during  its  pilot  phase.  The  World 
Bank  also  made  loans  for  environmental  and  natural  resource 
management  in  Rondonia  and  Mato  Grosso,  in  part  to  correct 
environmental  and  social  problems  that  had  been  created  by 
the  World  Bank-funded  development  of  the  northwest  corridor 
in  the  1980s. 

Despite  favorable  laws,  promising  institutional  arrange- 
ments, and  external  funding,  the  government  has  not,  on  the 


108 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


whole,  been  effective  in  controlling  damage  to  the  environ- 
ment. This  failure  is  only  in  small  measure  because  of  the 
opposition  of  anti-environmental  groups.  In  greater  part,  it  can 
be  attributed  to  the  traditional  separation  between  official  rhet- 
oric and  actual  practice  in  Brazil.  It  is  also  related  to  general 
problems  of  governance,  fiscal  crisis,  and  lingering  doubts 
about  appropriate  tradeoffs  between  the  environment  and 
development.  Some  of  the  most  effective  governmental  action 
in  the  environmental  area  has  occurred  at  the  state  and  local 
levels  in  the  most  developed  states  and  has  involved  NGOs.  In 
1994  the  PNMA  began  to  stress  decentralization  and  strength- 
ening of  state  environmental  agencies,  a  tendency  that  subse- 
quently gained  momentum. 

Population 

Population  Size  and  Distribution 

At  the  turn  of  the  century,  Brazil's  population  was 
17,438,434.  By  1950  it  had  grown  to  51,944,397,  and  in  1970  it 
reached  93,139,037.  By  1991  Brazil  was  the  world's  sixth  most 
populous  country,  with  about  2.7  percent  of  the  world's  5.3  bil- 
lion people  or  147,053,940  inhabitants.  In  July  1996,  the  popu- 
lation was  counted  as  being  157,079,573,  but  estimated  in  1997 
to  be  nearly  160  million.  Projections  indicate  a  total  population 
of  169  million  in  2000  and  211  million  in  2020,  and  population 
stability  at  about  250  million  in  2050.  The  population  growth 
rate  for  the  1992  to  2000  period  is  estimated  at  1.5  percent  per 
year.  As  a  result  of  the  decline  in  mortality  and  continued  high 
fertility  during  the  1950s  and  1960s,  the  average  growth  rate 
was  nearly  3  percent  per  year.  Subsequent  to  a  decrease  in  total 
fertility,  the  growth  rate  dropped  to  2.5  percent  in  the  1970s 
and  1.9  percent  in  the  1980s. 

Average  population  density  in  Brazil  in  1994  was  18.5  inhab- 
itants per  square  kilometer.  There  was  a  wide  variation  between 
the  densely  populated  Southeast  and  South,  on  the  one  hand, 
and  the  sparse  North  and  Center-West,  on  the  other,  with  the 
Northeast  at  intermediate  levels.  In  comparison,  in  1991  the 
United  States  (including  Alaska)  had  an  average  of  twenty-five 
inhabitants  per  square  kilometer;  France,  100;  the  United 
Kingdom,  100;  China,  110;  and  Canada,  three. 

According  to  the  1996  count,  the  most  populous  region  in 
the  country  is  still  the  Southeast  (63  million  inhabitants),  fol- 
lowed by  the  Northeast  (45  million),  the  South  (23.1  million), 


109 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

the  North  (11.1  million),  and  the  Center-West  (10.2  million). 
The  most  inhabited  states  are  Sao  Paulo,  Minas  Gerais,  Rio  de 
Janeiro,  Bahia,  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  and  Parana.  These  states  all 
lie  along  the  Atlantic  coast. 

In  some  rural  areas  and  many  cities,  particularly  in  major 
metropolitan  areas,  females  outnumber  males.  The  historical 
predominance  of  women  over  men  in  the  Brazilian  population 
has  persisted.  The  1996  count  showed  that  there  were  ninety- 
seven  men  for  every  100  women  and  that  the  total  number  of 
women  exceeded  the  number  of  men  by  5  million. 

The  average  age  of  the  Brazilian  population  has  increased  as 
a  result  of  a  continued  decrease  in  mortality  and  fertility. 
Between  1980  and  1990,  the  proportional  share  of  children 
from  birth  to  age  fourteen  decreased  from  38.2  to  34.7  per- 
cent, while  the  share  for  those  of  age  fifteen  to  sixty-four 
increased  from  57.8  to  61.1  percent.  The  proportion  of  elderly 
(age  sixty-five  or  greater)  increased  from  4.0  to  4.2  percent  and 
is  projected  to  reach  9.0  percent  by  the  year  2020.  In  all  regions 
of  the  country,  the  count  registered  an  increased  number  of 
people  of  ages  fifteen  to  sixty-four  and  of  older  people  over 
sixty-four  years  old.  In  the  Southeast,  for  example,  the  propor- 
tion of  people  in  the  former  age  bracket  increased  from  the 
61.7  percent  registered  in  1980  to  63.6  percent  in  1991,  while 
the  number  of  older  people  increased  from  4.2  percent  to  5.1 
percent. 

The  demographic  transition  in  Brazil  becomes  apparent  as 
the  bottom  of  the  very  wide-based  pyramid,  typical  of  develop- 
ing countries  with  high  birthrates,  begins  to  narrow  (see  fig.  6). 
Further  declines  in  the  fertility  rate,  estimated  at  2.44  children 
born  per  woman  in  1994,  eventually  will  lead  to  a  pyramid  that 
is  shaped  more  like  a  bullet,  with  cohorts  under  age  sixty  of 
roughly  equal  size.  Senior  citizens  will  live  longer,  and  the  pro- 
portion of  young  people  will  decline.  In  the  year  2000,  young 
people  will  account  for  28.3  percent  of  the  population  and 
senior  citizens,  8  percent.  Couples  will  have  fewer  children, 
and  the  fertility  rate  may  be  less  than  2.2  children  per  woman, 
the  replacement  level. 

Mortality 

As  is  typical  in  demographic  transitions,  declines  in  mortality 
preceded  declines  in  fertility  in  Brazil,  but  the  process  took 
only  a  few  decades  rather  than  centuries,  as  it  did  in  developed 
countries.  The  death  rate  started  to  fall  in  the  1940s  because  of 


110 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


the  expanding  public  health  system,  urbanization,  and  sanita- 
tion. The  crude  death  rate  in  1995  was  eight  per  1,000  popula- 
tion, a  notable  decrease  from  the  1960-65  rate  of  12.3.  The 
1995  level,  which  is  similar  to  that  of  developed  countries, 
resulted  from  the  age  structure  being  still  relatively  younger. 

Life  expectancy  at  birth,  which  is  a  measure  of  mortality  that 
is  not  affected  by  different  age  structures,  began  to  rise  in  Bra- 
zil in  the  1940s.  It  increased  from  42.7  years  in  1940  to  52.7 
years  in  1970  and  67.1  years  in  1995.  It  is  projected  to  reach 
68.5  years  in  2000  and  75.5  years  in  2020.  Life  expectancy  for 
women  is  about  seven  years  greater  than  that  for  men,  but  the 
differential  is  decreasing. 

A  decline  in  mortality  has  occurred  in  all  regions,  but  strong 
regional  variations  in  life  expectancy  persist.  The  lowest  levels 
are  found  in  the  Northeast  (65.4  years  in  1995)  and  the  highest 
in  the  South  (69.4  years  in  1995),  slightly  higher  than  the 
Southeast.  The  North  and  Center-West  regions  have  levels  of 
life  expectancy  close  to  the  national  average.  Within  the  socio- 
economic strata,  higher  life  expectancy  is  strongly  associated 
with  higher  family  income.  Mortality  is  generally  higher  in 
rural  than  in  urban  areas,  except  for  the  lowest  income  groups. 

In  the  past,  the  principal  causes  of  death  in  Brazil  were  infec- 
tious and  contagious  diseases,  especially  diarrhea  and  intestinal 
parasites  among  infants,  as  well  as  tuberculosis,  measles,  and 
respiratory  diseases  (for  a  discussion  of  infant  mortality,  see 
Indicators  of  Health,  this  ch.).  As  these  were  brought  under 
control  in  the  postwar  period,  primarily  in  the  more  developed 
regions,  degenerative  diseases  such  as  cardiovascular  disorders 
and  cancer  became  proportionately  more  prevalent.  Deaths 
from  external  causes,  including  violence  and  traffic  accidents, 
also  gained  importance. 

Fertility 

In  1996  the  crude  birthrate  was  estimated  at  21.16  births  per 
1,000  population,  a  significant  reduction  from  42.1  for  the 
1960-65  period.  As  in  the  case  of  mortality,  crude  birthrates 
are  affected  by  the  age  structure  and,  therefore,  difficult  to 
compare  among  countries  and  regions  or  over  time.  It  is  pref- 
erable to  use  the  total  fertility  rate,  a  standardized  measure  that 
corresponds  to  the  average  number  of  children  per  woman  at 
age  forty-nine,  the  end  of  her  reproductive  life,  assuming  that 
she  has  survived  and  followed  the  fertility  patterns  characteris- 
tic of  each  age  category.

Brazil's  total  fertility  rate  dropped  from  close  to  six  in  the 
1940s  and  1950s  to  3.3  in  1986  to  2.44  in  1994,  not  much 
higher  than  the  replacement  level  of  2.2.  Fertility  declined  in 
urban  and  rural  areas,  in  all  regions,  and  among  all  socioeco- 
nomic strata,  although  the  rates  continued  to  vary.  In  large 
countries,  such  a  rapid  and  generalized  fertility  decline  had 
been  observed  previously  only  in  China,  where  official  policy 
placed  intense  pressure  on  couples  to  have  only  one  child.  Pro- 
jections indicate  a  total  fertility  rate  of  2.0  in  the  year  2000  and 
1.8  in  2020,  lower  than  replacement. 

The  Brazilian  birthrate  began  to  decline  noticeably  in  the 
1970s,  by  which  time  socioeconomic  changes  had  made  large 
families  less  affordable  than  in  the  traditional  social  and  eco-

nomic  structure  in  rural  areas.  In  the  past,  especially  in  rural 
areas,  children  started  work  early  and  supported  their  parents 
in  old  age,  and  the  children  did  not  cost  much  to  raise.  In  the 
1990s,  they  attend  school  for  longer  periods  and  cost  more  to 
support. 

Meanwhile,  new  methods  of  birth  control,  primarily  pills 
and  female  sterilization,  became  widely  available  in  the  1970s. 
Oral  contraceptives  are  sold  over  the  counter  without  prescrip- 
tion. Surgical  sterilization,  which  is  practiced  in  Brazil  more 
than  any  other  country,  is  typically  performed  during  cesarean 
deliveries.  Such  deliveries  comprised  nearly  a  third  of  all  deliv- 
eries in  the  1980s.  Surgical  sterilization  is  of  questionable  legal- 
ity, but  is  often  carried  out  by  doctors  who  are  paid  for  the 
cesarean  section  by  the  public  health  system  and  receive  pri- 
vate payment  for  extra  services  on  the  side. 

The  number  of  Brazilian  couples  opting  for  sterilization  as  a 
means  of  contraception  increased  by  more  than  40  percent 
during  the  1986-96  period,  based  on  the  Demographic  and 
Health  Survey  carried  out  by  Bemfam,  an  NGO.  The  survey, 
conducted  between  March  and  July  1996,  interviewed  12,612 
women  between  fifteen  and  forty-nine  years  of  age  as  well  as 
2,949  men  between  fifteen  and  fifty-nine  years.  The  survey 
found  that  40.1  percent  of  married  women  or  women  living 
with  partners  had  been  sterilized,  as  compared  with  26.9  per- 
cent in  1986.  In  1986  only  0.8  percent  of  males  had  had  a  vasec- 
tomy, as  compared  with  2.6  percent  in  1996.  The  Bemfam 
survey  showed  that  the  average  age  at  which  women  are  steril- 
ized was  28.9  years  in  1996,  as  compared  with  31.4  years  in 
1986. 

In  the  early  1990s,  the  use  of  birth-control  pills  and  female 
sterilization  (tubal  ligation)  continued  to  contribute  to  the  fer- 
tility decline  in  Brazil.  About  65  percent  of  Brazilian  women 
used  contraceptives,  which  is  comparable  with  levels  in  devel- 
oped countries.  Of  the  women  who  used  some  method  and 
were  in  union,  44  percent  were  sterilized.  About  7  percent  used 
rhythm,  while  other  contraceptives  or  methods  were  rarer. 

Abortion  in  Brazil  is  significant.  In  the  early  1990s,  some  1.4 
million  abortions  were  performed  each  year,  almost  all  of 
which  were  technically  illegal.  This  corresponds  to  approxi- 
mately one  abortion  for  every  two  live  births.  The  only  cases  in 
which  abortion  is  not  subject  to  legal  sanctions  in  Brazil  are 
rape  and  danger  to  the  mother's  life,  but  the  law  is  not 
enforced  effectively.  The  practice  of  unsafe,  clandestine  abor- 


113 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

tions  helps  to  explain  why  Brazil  has  the  fifth  highest  maternal 
mortality  rate  in  Latin  America,  estimated  at  141  deaths  per 
1,000  births,  in  contrast  to  eight  in  the  United  States. 

A  fertility  decline  in  Brazil  occurred  in  the  absence  of  any 
official  policy  in  favor  of  controlling  birthrates.  The  govern- 
ment's stance  was  one  of  laissez-faire.  Although  it  did  not  pro- 
mote family  planning,  largely  because  of  the  influence  of  the 
Roman  Catholic  Church,  the  government  did  little  to  interfere 
with  the  widespread  practice  of  contraception  among  the  pop- 
ulation at  large.  Nor  did  the  population  pay  much  heed  to  reli- 
gious dogma.  In  the  case  of  fertility  regulation,  social  change  in 
Brazil  occurred  from  the  bottom  up.  Women  took  much  of  the 
initiative. 

In  the  1980s,  the  Ministry  of  Health  included  family  plan- 
ning services  as  part  of  an  integrated  women's  health  program. 
However,  because  of  a  severe  lack  of  funds,  the  direct  effects  of 
the  program  were  limited.  Changing  public  opinion  and  the 
women's  movement  in  Brazil  favored  changes  in  official  policy, 
which  were  slow  to  come  about.  The  1988  constitution 
included  the  right  to  plan  freely  the  number  of  children.  A 
Family  Planning  Law  took  effect  in  1997  in  order  to  regulate 
sterilization,  making  it  available  in  the  public  health  network 
but  forbidding  it  during  deliveries,  as  well  as  provide  birth-con- 
trol alternatives  through  the  same  network. 

Migration  and  Urbanization 

Immigration  from  Europe  and  the  African  slave  trade,  which 
were  the  prime  sources  of  population  growth  during  much  of 
Brazil's  history,  became  demographically  insignificant  by  the 
1930s.  Subsequently,  there  were  massive  transfers  of  internal 
migrants  from  the  Northeast  and  Minas  Gerais  to  the  growing 
urban  centers  of  Sao  Paulo  and  Rio  de  Janeiro.  Over  time, 
there  were  successive  waves  of  significant  but  less  voluminous 
counterflows  to  frontier  areas  in  Parana,  the  Center-West,  and 
finally  the  Amazon.  The  government's  colonization  plans, 
which  included  settlement  along  the  Trans-Amazonian  High- 
way, stimulated  internal  migration.  However,  the  last  cycle  of 
frontier  expansion  came  to  a  close,  at  least  temporarily,  in  the 
late  1980s. 

During  the  1950s,  1960s,  and  1970s,  some  20  million  people 
moved  from  rural  to  urban  areas  in  Brazil.  This  population 
movement  constitutes  one  of  the  largest  of  its  kind  in  history. 
Brazil's  urban  population  (by  the  official  definition)  grew  at 


114 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


rates  of  about  5  percent  per  year  and  accounted  for  56  percent 
of  the  total  population  in  1970,  68  percent  in  1980,  and  75  per- 
cent in  1991.  During  most  of  the  post-World  War  II  period,  the 
largest  cities  grew  fastest  as  a  result  of  gradual  migration  to  pro- 
gressively larger  cities.  In  the  1980s,  however,  the  proportion  of 
Brazil's  population  living  in  metropolitan  areas  dropped  from 
29  percent  to  28  percent.  The  new  pattern  of  population  redis- 
tribution revealed  by  the  1991  census  involved  less  interre- 
gional migration,  with  more  people  staying  in  their  regions  of 
origin  or  moving  to  large  cities  nearby  rather  than  to  megaci- 
ties. 

Numerous  efforts  have  been  made  at  the  policy  level  to  stim- 
ulate settlement  in  the  interior,  including  colonization  in  the 
Amazon,  and  to  limit  the  growth  of  the  largest  cities  while 
strengthening  middle-sized  cities.  Despite  these  efforts,  how- 
ever, most  public  policies  have  continued  to  favor  population 
concentration  in  the  Southeast  and  in  large  cities  by  promoting 
industry  at  the  cost  of  agriculture  and  by  providing  services 
and  benefits  primarily  to  urban  residents. 

During  the  1980s,  as  a  result  of  economic  crisis  and 
improved  transportation  services,  emigration  from  Brazil 
increased  to  other  countries,  including  the  United  States,  Can- 
ada, Portugal,  and  Japan.  For  the  first  time  ever,  Brazil  became 
a  net  exporter  of  population  and  thus  entered  a  new  stage  in  its 
demographic  history.  Some  of  the  emigrants  sought  employ- 
ment in  menial  jobs  in  developed  countries;  others  were  skilled 
personnel,  including  scientists  and  engineers.  However,  a  note- 
worthy reverse  brain  drain  also  took  place,  with  skilled  workers 
from  other  Latin  American  countries  and  Europe  constituting 
a  significant  proportion  of  new  immigrants.  Immigration 
increased  from  neighboring  countries,  especially  members  of 
the  Common  Market  of  the  South  (Mercado  Comum  do  Sul — 
Mercosul;  see  Glossary),  including  Argentina,  Uruguay,  and 
Paraguay,  as  well  as  from  some  countries  in  Africa  and  Asia. 

Social  Structure 

Social  Classes 

Brazil  inherited  a  highly  stratified  society  from  the  colonial 
system  and  from  slavery,  which  persisted  for  nearly  three  gener- 
ations after  independence  in  1822.  The  legacy  of  sharp  socio- 
economic stratification  is  reflected  in  Brazil's  highly  skewed 
income  distribution,  among  the  world's  worst  (see  Inequality 


115 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

and  Poverty,  ch.  3).  The  relatively  high  average  per  capita 
income  (US$4,086  in  1995)  masks  deep  inequality.  During  the 
postwar  period,  income  concentration  and  regional  disequilib- 
rium did  not  change  significantly  despite  numerous  govern- 
ment policies  aimed  at  greater  equity.  Poverty  was  widespread, 
reaching  the  lowest  levels  in  the  rural  parts  of  the  Northeast, 
but  also  including  pockets  of  urban  poverty  in  the  largest  cities 
in  the  developed  regions.  In  1990  the  number  of  indigents  suf- 
fering from  extreme  poverty  (see  Glossary)  was  estimated  to  be 
at  least  32  million,  about  one-fifth  of  the  country's  total  popula- 
tion. This  included  an  estimated  9.6  percent  of  the  residents  of 
metropolitan  areas,  18.4  percent  of  the  population  of  other 
urban  areas,  and  42.8  percent  of  the  rural  population. 

Socioeconomic  inequality  involves  subtle  forms  of  residen- 
tial, educational,  and  workplace  discrimination,  in  such  ways 
that  members  of  distinct  socioeconomic  strata  tend  to  live, 
work,  and  circulate  in  different  settings.  The  well-to-do  live  in 
chic  neighborhoods,  usually  centrally  located,  go  to  private 
schools,  drive  or  ride  in  cars,  and  shop  at  malls.  The  urban 
poor  live  in  favelas  or  distant  housing  projects,  take  long  bus 
trips  to  work,  go  to  public  schools  or  drop  out,  and  shop  at 
smaller  supermarkets  or  local  shops.  The  rural  poor  in  the 
country's  interior  are  practically  invisible  to  the  urban  upper 
and  middle  classes. 

Despite  such  social  segregation,  class  solidarity  is  not  strong. 
Instead  of  horizontal  class  ties,  numerous  cross-cutting  vertical 
relationships  involve  personal  dependence  on  individuals  who 
have  more  property  and  prestige.  Given  the  circumstances, 
these  relationships  of  clientelism  and  paternalism  are  advanta- 
geous for  both  patrons  and  clients.  Because  of  the  lack  of  effec- 
tive government  services  and  real  possibilities  for  class  action, 
the  poor  have  few  alternatives  but  to  seek  the  protection  of 
patrons.  The  traditional  rural  forms  of  patronage  have  been 
described  as  colonelism  {coronelismo — see  Glossary),  referring 
to  the  fact  that  rural  bosses  often  had  military  titles  (see  The 
Old  or  First  Republic,  1889-1930,  ch.  1).  Among  other  things, 
colonels  (coroneis)  used  their  influence  over  their  clientele  for 
electoral  purposes.  Such  vertical  interpersonal  ties  continue  to 
be  stronger  in  rural  areas,  especially  in  the  Northeast,  but  they 
also  persist  in  other  forms  in  urban  settings  and  at  various  lev- 
els of  the  socioeconomic  scale.  Even  members  of  the  modern 
middle  class  tend  to  have  lower-income  persons  or  families 
dependent  on  them  for  such  things  as  domestic  employment 


116 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


and  economic  or  health  emergencies.  They,  in  turn,  seek  help 
from  powerful  friends  and  relatives. 

Contrary  to  dualistic  stereotypes  of  Latin  American  societies, 
Brazilian  class  structure  cannot  be  reduced  to  a  wealthy  landed 
elite  versus  masses  of  poor  peasants  and  workers.  The  middle 
sectors  or  classes  have  been  significant  at  least  since  the  nine- 
teenth century.  Sectors  of  Brazil's  population  that  were  neither 
slave  owners  nor  slaves  began  to  grow  in  the  colonial  period, 
when  craftsmen,  shopkeepers,  small  farmers,  freed  slaves,  and 
persons  of  mixed  racial  origin  began  to  outnumber  slave  own- 
ers and  eventually  slaves.  During  the  twentieth  century,  the 
middle  sectors  continued  to  grow.  The  present  middle  class 
does  not  own  large  properties,  industries,  or  firms  but  also  is 
not  destitute.  It  consists  largely  of  a  technical  work  force — 
clerks,  professionals,  teachers,  salespersons,  public  servants, 
and  highly  skilled  workers.  Its  position  is  based  more  on  knowl- 
edge and  skills  than  on  property.  A  surge  of  upward  mobility 
strengthened  the  middle  class  during  the  "economic  miracle" 
in  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s.  At  the  same  time,  blue-collar 
workers  with  middle  to  low  levels  of  skills  constitute  a  lower 
middle  class  that  is  numerically  very  significant. 

In  addition  to  those  formally  employed,  many  workers  are  in 
the  so-called  informal  economy  (see  Glossary),  which  includes 
self-employed  businessmen  and  workers  who  do  not  have  the 
legal  protection  of  labor  legislation.  In  1990  the  informal  sec- 
tor accounted  for  nearly  half  of  the  economically  active  popula- 
tion. The  informal  sector  grows  in  times  of  recession  because 
of  unemployment  and  during  times  of  prosperity,  when  oppor- 
tunities for  making  money  are  more  readily  available.  A  survey 
released  in  1996  by  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Geography  and 
Statistics  (Fundacao  Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Geografia  e  Estatis- 
tica — IBGE)  showed  that  only  85  percent  of  those  questioned 
wanted  to  seek  formal  employment. 

Increasingly,  the  system  of  social  stratification  that  was  origi- 
nally based  on  property  (land  or  industry)  has  evolved  in  such 
a  way  that  individuals  who  acquire  special  technical  skills  or 
know-how  are  able  to  earn  reasonable  incomes.  Outside  these 
two  groups  of  propertied  or  skilled  individuals  lies  a  significant 
mass,  perhaps  a  majority,  that  is  excluded  in  the  sense  of  lim- 
ited participation  in  markets  and  poor  access  to  government 
services,  such  as  health,  education,  and  sanitation.

Gender 

For  reasons  of  property  transmission  and  religion,  Brazilian 
society  was  originally  strongly  patriarchal,  but  there  was  also 
strong  tension  between  rigid  norms  of  Iberian  origin  and  the 
extenuating  circumstances  of  frontier  life,  where  conditions 
were  not  favorable  for  compliance  with  the  norms.  The  diffi- 
culty of  putting  Roman  Catholic  values  into  effective  practice 
in  the  context  of  poverty,  isolation,  and  unbalanced  male/ 
female  sex  ratios  (number  of  men  per  100  women)  reinforced 
the  Mediterranean  double  moral  standard  for  men  and 
women.  Men  were  expected  to  demonstrate  their  masculinity, 
while  proper  women  were  supposed  to  remain  virgins  until 
marriage  and  to  be  faithful  to  their  husbands.  This  double 
standard  also  favored  frequent  consensual  unions,  illegitimacy, 
and  prostitution.  Such  behavior  was  not  entirely  acceptable  but 
was  tolerated  more  readily  in  Brazil,  generally  speaking,  than 
in  North  America  and  the  rest  of  Latin  America. 

Although  women  were  allowed  open  access  to  schools  and 
employment  around  the  turn  of  the  century  and  suffrage  on  a 
national  level  in  1933,  they  were  not  on  an  equal  footing  with 
men  in  family  affairs.  Men  were  automatically  heads  of  house- 
holds, and  married  women  were  legally  subordinate  to  their 
husbands.  Because  of  the  inconvenience  caused  by  informal 
remarriage,  divorce  was  made  legal  in  1977.  Under  the  consti- 
tution of  1988,  women  became  entirely  equal  to  men  for  all 
legal  purposes. 

Female  participation  in  the  labor  force  grew  dramatically  in 
the  1970s  and  1980s,  as  a  result  of  new  employment  patterns, 
especially  the  expansion  of  the  services  sector,  and  economic 
pressures  on  family  income.  Women  are  most  commonly 
employed  as  domestic  servants.  The  economic  participation  of 
women  in  Brazil  rose  from  18  percent  in  1970  to  27  percent  by 
1980  and  30  percent  by  1990  (although  such  figures  might 
underestimate  actual  rates  of  participation  by  failing  to  include 
the  informal  activities  that  characterize  small  and/ or  house- 
hold enterprises).  More  than  70  percent  of  women  in  the  labor 
force  are  employed  by  the  services  sector  (as  compared  with  42 
percent  of  men),  and  women  tend  to  be  underrepresented 
among  the  formal  labor  force  in  agricultural  and  industrial 
activities.  Patterns  of  labor  force  participation  vary  consider- 
ably by  region.  In  the  early  1990s,  rates  of  female  labor  force 
participation  ranged  from  36.8  percent  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  to 
33.1  percent  in  the  Northeast.  In  Brazil,  as  in  most  other  coun- 


118

tries  in  Latin  America,  rates  of  females  participating  in  the  job 
market  appear  to  increase  with  education,  especially  the  pro- 
portion of  single  educated  women  entering  the  formal  sector 
rather  than  the  informal  and  self-employed  sectors. 

There  is  a  considerable  wage  gap  between  men  and  women. 
According  to  one  recent  estimate,  the  differential  between 
women  and  men  is  less  pronounced  in  urban  areas  (for  exam- 
ple, women  earn  on  average  77.8  percent  of  men's  wages  in  Rio 
de  Janeiro  and  73.6  percent  in  Sao  Paulo),  and  most  pro- 
nounced in  the  Northeast  (where,  on  average,  women  earn 
63.5  percent  of  the  wages  of  men).  Average  wages  are  also  con- 
siderably lower  in  the  Northeast,  where  women's  average 
hourly  wages  are  42  percent  of  the  prevailing  average  in  Rio  de 
Janeiro.  According  to  recent  economic  studies,  only  a  small 


119 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 


portion  (between  11  percent  and  19  percent  of  wage  differen- 
tials in  the  formal  labor  force)  can  be  attributed  to  differences 
between  men  and  women  in  their  endowments  (such  as  educa- 
tion or  experience).  For  the  most  part,  the  wage  gap  probably 
reflects  discriminatory  practices. 

Recent  decades  have  also  been  characterized  by  significant 
changes  in  family  structures.  For  example,  the  available  data 
suggest  a  considerable  increase  over  the  past  decades  in 
female-headed  households,  which  include  the  poorest  of  the 
poor,  from  13  percent  in  1970  to  16  percent  in  1980  and  20 
percent  by  the  late  1980s.  This  process  has  been  termed  the 
"feminization  of  poverty."  Once  again,  there  are  considerable 
differences  among  regions;  in  the  urban  North  Region,  for 
example,  over  24  percent  of  households  were  headed  by 
women  in  the  late  1980s,  while  their  relative  share  in  the  South 
was  closer  to  16  percent. 

Despite  persistent  gender  inequality,  the  status  of  women  in 
Brazil  is  improving  on  various  fronts.  As  a  rule,  there  are  as 
many  females  as  males  in  schools,  even  at  the  highest  levels, 
and  professions  that  traditionally  were  dominated  by  males, 
such  as  law,  medicine,  dentistry,  and  engineering,  are  becom- 
ing more  balanced  in  terms  of  gender,  if  there  are  not  already 
more  women  students  than  men.  More  women  than  men  are  in 
the  National  Lawyers'  Association  (Associacao  Nacional  dos 
Advogados).  The  attitudes  and  practices  of  young  people  are 
generally  not  as  sexist  as  those  of  their  parents,  at  least  among 
youth  of  families  with  higher  income  and  education. 

Nevertheless,  there  are  still  relatively  few  women  in  positions 
of  power.  They  have  a  significant,  albeit  limited,  presence  in 
high  levels  of  federal  government,  although  they  have  better 
representation  at  the  state  and  municipal  levels.  Since  the  gov- 
ernment of  Joao  Baptista  do  Oliveira  Figueiredo  (president, 
1979-85),  several  female  ministers  have  been  in  the  cabinet, 
and  in  1994  two  women  were  candidates  for  vice  president.  By 
1994  women  made  up  only  7  percent  of  the  Congress  (see 
Women  in  Politics,  ch.  4). 

Women's  movements  grew  in  the  1980s,  when  a  National 
Council  on  Women's  Rights  (Conselho  Nacional  de  Direitos  da 
Mulher — CNDM)  was  created.  Originally,  the  feminist  move- 
ment was  closely  connected  to  human  rights  movements  and 
resistance  to  the  military  regime.  In  the  1980s  and  1990s,  atten- 
tion shifted  to  violence  against  women,  especially  domestic  vio- 
lence and  sexual  abuse  and  harassment.  One  original  response 


120 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


to  this  kind  of  problem  was  the  creation  of  special  police  sta- 
tions for  women.  Women's  movements  also  mobilized  support 
for  reproductive  health  and  rights,  as  defined  in  the  1994  Inter- 
national Conference  on  Population  and  Development,  held  in 
Cairo. 

Youth 

The  population  under  age  eighteen  was  only  30.7  percent  of 
the  total  population  in  1991.  This  significant  decrease  relative 
to  previous  decades — it  was  over  42.6  percent  in  1960 — was 
almost  entirely  the  result  of  rapid  fertility  decline.  Compared 
with  developed  countries,  as  mentioned  above,  Brazil  still  has  a 
relatively  young  population. 

Overall,  school  enrollment  in  the  early  1990s  reached  about 
90  percent  of  school-age  children  (seven  to  fourteen), 
although  there  was  wide  variation,  with  lower  coverage  among 
rural  and  low-income  populations.  There  were  also  high  levels 
of  repetition,  and  only  a  minority  of  those  who  entered  first 
grade  completed  the  eight  grades  of  fundamental  schooling. 
One  reason  for  the  high  dropout  rate  was  child  labor.  In  1990, 
18  percent  of  the  children  between  the  ages  of  ten  and  four- 
teen participated  in  economic  activity. 

Because  of  marital  instability,  unwanted  pregnancies,  and 
above  all  poverty,  there  are  thousands  of  apparently  homeless 
"street  children"  (meninos  de  rua)  in  Brazil.  The  numbers 
require  cautious  use  because,  in  addition  to  about  10,000  chil- 
dren who  actually  live  in  the  streets,  this  category  also  includes 
many  children  who  work  or  otherwise  generate  income  to  help 
their  families.  Truly  homeless  street  children  constitute  a  small 
minority.  They  attracted  considerable  public  and  media  atten- 
tion nationally  and  internationally  in  the  early  1990s  because 
of  their  high  visibility  and  frequent  petty  thievery,  as  well  as 
cases  of  violent  retaliation,  including  murder,  by  the  police  and 
local  businesspeople. 

At  least  officially,  minors  have  long  been  protected  by  the 
Brazilian  legal  system.  Judges  in  juvenile  cases  (juizes  demenores) 
protect  their  interests,  and  a  network  of  institutions,  in  theory, 
cares  for  their  welfare.  In  1990,  in  response  to  the  problems  of 
youth,  the  Collor  government  passed  special  legislation  to 
establish  children's  rights,  known  as  the  Children's  Statute,  and 
created  the  Brazilian  Center  of  Infancy  and  Adolescence  (Cen- 
tro  Brasileiro  de  Infancia  e  Adolescencia — CBIA)  to  carry  out 
special  programs  for  children  in  these  age-groups.  The  govern-

ment  also  promoted  the  establishment  of  federal,  state,  and 
municipal  councils  of  childhood  and  adolescence,  which 
included  participants  from  government  agencies  and  civil  soci- 
ety. The  National  Street  Children's  Movement  is  an  NGO.  The 
United  Nations  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF)  developed  the  Pact 
for  Childhood,  and  the  National  Conference  of  Brazilian  Bish- 
ops (Conferencia  Nacional  dos  Bispos  do  Brasil — CNBB)  sup- 
ported the  Children's  Pastoral  Service. 

The  Elderly 

The  proportion  of  elderly  in  the  population  increases  as  fer- 
tility declines  and  longevity  increases.  The  absolute  numbers 
grow  faster  than  the  total  population.  The  proportion  of  the 
Brazilian  population  age  sixty-five  and  older  grew  from  6.4  per- 
cent in  1960  to  7.6  percent  in  1980  and  8  percent  in  1991,  or 
about  11.7  million.  By  2020  the  number  is  expected  to  increase 
to  15  percent  of  the  population,  or  about  33  million.  Brazil 
faces  particular  problems  with  the  aged  because  of  difficulties 
in  employing  them  (younger  and  better  trained  workers  are 
preferred  over  middle-aged  workers)  and  a  lack  of  appropriate 
means  to  care  for  them.  As  people  live  longer,  the  number  of 
siblings  and  children  drops,  and  population  mobility  increases. 
Consequently,  older  people  are  less  likely  to  have  children  or 
other  relatives  living  nearby  who  are  willing  and  able  to  care  for 
them.  In  1996  the  country  was  shocked  by  the  number  of 
deaths  of  elderly  living  in  very  poor  conditions  in  publicly  sup- 
ported homes  for  senior  citizens,  especially  the  case  of  the 
Santa  Genoveva  Clinic  in  Rio  de  Janeiro. 

The  government-run  social  security  system  provides  minimal 
pensions  for  retired  people,  including  those  in  rural  areas  who 
did  not  contribute  to  the  system  as  employees.  However,  health 
care  becomes  expensive  in  old  age,  especially  for  the  so-called 
degenerative  diseases,  and  the  cost  of  private  health  insurance 
becomes  prohibitive.  Retired  persons  were  successful  in  orga- 
nizing pressure  groups  to  protect  the  real  value,  after  inflation, 
of  their  pensions  in  the  early  1990s  by  keeping  them  pegged  to 
the  minimum  wage.  Nonetheless,  these  pensions  were  still  far 
from  being  sufficient  to  care  for  the  needs  of  most  elderly  per- 
sons. 

Race  and  Ethnicity 

The  first  European  immigrants  to  Brazil  were  of  Iberian  ori- 
gin, primarily  Portuguese.  Some  Portuguese  settlers  were  of

Jewish  or  Moorish  origin  but  most  of  them  had  converted  to 
Christianity.  There  were  also  some  Dutch  immigrants  to  the 
Northeast  in  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries.  The  Por- 
tuguese intermarried  with  the  Amerindian  population,  which 
was  decimated  by  conflict  and  disease. 

During  the  colonial  period,  after  Indian  slavery  proved  diffi- 
cult to  enforce,  the  colonists  imported  hundreds  of  thousands 
of  slaves  from  Africa  for  labor  on  the  sugar  plantations,  in  the 
mines,  and  later  on  coffee  plantations.  At  first,  slaves  outnum- 
bered the  white  settlers  in  many  areas,  but  the  balance  eventu- 
ally changed  because  of  their  high  mortality  and  low  fertility. 
However,  as  slavery  became  economically  and  politically  less 
feasible  after  1850  and  the  British  blocked  the  slave  trade,  Ital- 
ian immigrants  began  replacing  the  slaves  on  coffee  planta- 
tions in  Sao  Paulo.  During  the  same  period,  settlers  from 
Europe,  primarily  Germany,  Italy,  and  Poland,  established 
farming  colonies  in  parts  of  the  South. 

Brazil's  racial  mix  was  made  more  diverse  with  the  arrival  of 
Japanese  and  Middle  Eastern  immigrants  in  the  early  twentieth 
century.  At  first,  the  Japanese  worked  in  agriculture  in  Sao 
Paulo  and  the  Amazon,  while  the  Lebanese,  Turks,  and  Syrians 
became  involved  in  commerce  in  many  parts  of  the  country. 
During  the  1900s,  the  Japanese  descendants,  who  constitute 


123 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 


the  largest  community  of  Japanese  outside  of  Japan,  except  for 
Hawaii,  became  primarily  urban  residents,  especially  in  Sao 
Paulo.  In  the  1970s,  intermarriage  with  nonjapanese  became 
common. 

As  emphasized  by  anthropologists  such  as  Gilberto  Freyre 
and  Darcy  Ribeiro,  all  the  racial  and  ethnic  groups  that  arrived 
in  Brazil  intermingled  and  intermarried,  with  few  exceptions. 
This  led  to  increasing  mixtures  of  all  possible  combinations 
and  degrees.  Many  individuals  are,  therefore,  difficult  to  clas- 
sify in  racial  terms.  Questions  on  color  were  included  in  the 
demographic  censuses  of  1940,  1950,  1980,  and  1991. 
Although  the  answers  involved  self-classification  and  may  not 
have  been  objective,  it  was  clear  that  the  proportion  of  blacks 
decreased  while  that  of  mulattoes  increased.  There  was  a  simul- 
taneous process  of  "whitening."  The  self-declared  proportions 
in  1991  were  55.3  percent  white,  39.3  percent  mulatto,  4.9  per- 
cent black,  and  0.6  percent  Asian. 

Because  of  the  lack  of  a  clear  color  distinction  and  a  strong 
cultural  tradition  of  tolerance  and  cordiality,  as  well  as  long- 
standing explicit  laws  against  racial  discrimination,  Brazil  has 
been  touted  as  a  "racial  democracy."  However,  "racial  democ- 
racy" is  a  myth.  There  is  a  very  strong  correlation  between  light 
color  and  higher  income,  education,  and  social  status.  Few 
blacks  reach  positions  of  wealth,  prestige,  and  power,  except  in 
the  arts  and  sports.  Although  discrimination  is  usually  not 
explicit,  it  appears  in  subtle  forms:  unwritten  rules,  unspoken 
attitudes,  references  to  "good  appearance"  rather  than  color, 
or  simply  placing  higher  value  on  individuals  who  are  white  or 
nearly  white. 

In  the  1960s,  black  consciousness  began  to  grow,  although 
the  very  lack  of  a  clear  color  line  in  biological  or  social  terms 
weakened  racial  solidarity  of  the  nonwhite  population.  The 
prevailing  notion  that  Brazil  was  a  "racial  democracy"  also 
made  it  easy  to  dismiss  black  movements  as  un-Brazilian.  For 
the  most  part,  the  movements  did  not  press  for  changes  in  gov- 
ernment policy,  which  was  already  officially  against  racial  dis- 
crimination. Instead,  they  emphasized  racial  pride  and  the 
struggle  against  subtle  forms  of  discrimination  and  the  often 
covert  violence  to  which  blacks  were  subject. 

Amerindians 

Estimates  of  the  original  Amerindian  population  of  Brazil 
range  from  2  to  5  million  at  the  time  of  first  contact  with  Euro- 


124

peans  in  the  early  sixteenth  century.  There  were  hundreds  of 
tribes  and  languages.  Now  there  are  230  tribes  that  speak  more 
than  ninety  languages  and  300  dialects. 

Because  of  violence  and  disease,  the  original  Amerindian 
population  was  reduced  to  about  150,000  by  the  early  twentieth 
century.  In  1910  the  Indian  Protection  Service  (Servico  de  Pro- 
tecao  aos  Indios — SPI)  was  established.  Its  leader,  Marechal 
Candido  Rondon,  was  famous  for  stating  that  "one  should  die, 
if  necessary,  but  never  kill  an  Indian."  In  1968  the  National 
Indian  Foundation  (Fundacao  Nacional  do  Indio — Funai) 
replaced  SPI,  which  was  charged  with  corruption.  The  Indian 
Statute  went  into  effect  in  1973.  The  1988  constitution  pro- 
vides that  Indians  are  entitled  to  the  lands  that  they  tradition- 
ally occupy. 

Despite  the  difficulties  it  faced,  the  Amerindian  population 
began  to  recover  its  numbers  and  increased  to  330,000  by  the 
mid-1990s.  In  genetic  terms,  millions  of  Brazilians  have  some 
Amerindian  ancestry,  usually  on  the  side  of  their  grandmothers 
or  great-grandmothers.  The  ancestry  is  especially  strong  in  the 
Amazon  region,  where  the  inhabitants  of  mixed  Indian  and 
white  descent  are  called  caboclos.  Because  of  such  widespread 
miscegenation  and  acculturation,  objective  definitions  of 
"Indian"  are  practically  impossible  in  Brazil.  The  most  useful 
definition,  also  used  for  official  purposes,  is  subjective  but 
pragmatic:  Indians  are  those  who  consider  themselves  Indians 
and  are  considered  by  others  as  such.  They  include  groups  that 
are  officially  classified  as  isolated,  in  the  process  of  integration, 
or  integrated  (although  "integration"  involves  entry  into  the 
lowest  ranks  of  Brazilian  society) . 

Most  of  the  Amerindian  population  is  in  the  Amazon  region, 
where  Amerindian  lands  account  for  about  15  percent  of  the 
territory.  Some  of  the  largest  areas  were  set  aside  during  the 
Collor  administration  in  1992.  The  best  known  and  largest  of 
these  is  the  9.6-million-hectare  Yanomami  Indigenous  Park, 
located  in  the  northern  states  of  Amazonas  and  Roraima,  along 
Brazil's  border  with  Venezuela.  Gold  miners  and  their  diseases 
have  had  an  adverse  impact  on  the  Yanomami.  The  Caiapo  in 
southeastern  Para  became  widely  known  both  for  their  tradi- 
tional environmental  management  and  their  controversial  con- 
cessions to  gold  miners  and  lumber  companies.  Other 
indigenous  areas  include  the  Xingu  Indigenous  Park  and  other 
parts  of  Amazonia,  including  the  western  section  of  the  Ama- 
zon along  the  Rio  Solimoes,  Roraima,  northern  Amazonas, 


125 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Rondonia,  Acre,  Amapa,  and  northern  and  southeastern  Para. 
The  Northeast  (Maranhao)  and  Center-West  (western  Mato 
Grosso,  Mato  Grosso  do  Sul,  and  Goias)  regions  also  have 
large  indigenous  areas. 

Rural  Groups 

Some  groups  in  rural  Brazil  merit  special  attention. 
Although  there  has  been  massive  rural  to  urban  migration  in 
Brazil,  nearly  40  million  people  still  live  in  the  countryside,  and 
another  10  million  live  in  towns  with  a  population  under 
20,000.  There  are  also  signs  of  urban  to  rural  migration  as  a 
result  of  exhaustion  of  employment  and  income  opportunities 
in  large  cities. 

Many  of  the  inhabitants  of  the  countryside  are  rural  workers 
in  agriculture,  with  permanent  or,  more  typically,  seasonal 
employment,  particularly  in  harvesting,  an  activity  in  which 
women  and  children  are  also  involved.  Although  a  large  num- 
ber of  small  family  farmers  have  land  of  their  own,  millions  of 
rural  workers  are  landless  because  land  tenure  is  extremely 
concentrated  in  Brazil.  In  the  face  of  slowness  of  official  land 
reform,  they  began  to  invade  unproductive  properties  in  the 
1990s.  As  a  result  of  their  organization  and  massacres  of  their 
activists  in  Rondonia  and  Para,  they  entered  the  political  lime- 
light, and  land  reform  was  placed  high  on  the  political  agenda. 

In  addition  to  farmers,  Brazil  has  various  kinds  of  traditional 
populations — including  rubber  tappers,  Brazil  nut  collectors, 
caboclos  and  other  traditional  riverine  dwellers,  small  fisher- 
men, and  others — who  became  a  new  social  category  in  the  late 
1980s.  Some  of  them  received  land  from  the  government  in 
the  form  of  extractive  reserves,  meaning  land  containing  valu- 
able natural  resources  such  as  rubber-yielding  trees,  hard- 
woods, and  so  forth,  ceded  to  their  associations  on  the 
condition  that  they  use  their  natural  resources  in  a  sustainable 
way.  For  some  rural  Brazilians,  sustainable  extraction  presents 
an  alternative  to  rural  exodus  and  structural  unemployment. 

Cultural  Unity  and  Diversity 

Brazilian  culture  was  never  monolithic.  Since  the  sixteenth 
century,  it  has  been  an  amalgamation  of  traditional  Iberian, 
indigenous,  and  African  values,  as  well  as  more  recent  Western 
values,  developed  in  northern  Europe  and  the  United  States, 
such  as  equality,  democracy,  efficiency,  and  individual  rights.  At

times  there  are  subtle  or  open  conflicts,  especially  between 
norms  of  Mediterranean  and  Anglo-Saxon  origin,  or  between 
practices  of  European  versus  Amerindian  or  African  origin. 
However,  Brazil  is  remarkable  for  the  way  in  which  there  is 
unity  in  cultural  diversity.  Sometimes  the  values  and  practices 
of  different  origins  have  blended  with  each  other,  as  in  the  case 
of  Afro-Brazilian  religious  syncretism  or  liberation  theology 
(see  Glossary). 

Another  way  of  reconciling  diversity  has  been  the  often  con- 
siderable distance  between  actual  practices,  which  conform 
with  tradition,  and  official  norms,  which  generally  follow  the 
positivist  (positivism — see  Glossary)  logic  of  "order  and 
progress"  that  underlay  the  establishment  of  the  republic  in 
1889.  The  difference  between  norms  and  behavior,  or  between 
theory  and  practice,  is  a  constant  throughout  Brazilian  history. 
In  colonial  times  and  during  the  empire,  imported  cultural  val- 
ues and  social  norms  had  to  be  reconciled  with  the  extenuating 
circumstances  and  realities  of  a  frontier  situation.  Getting  mar- 
ried officially,  for  example,  was  difficult  in  the  absence  of 
priests  or  because  of  the  high  cost  of  service  by  the  justices  of 
the  peace.

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

In  the  1990s,  many  people  ignore  laws  that  are  not  enforced, 
or  allege  that  doing  the  right  thing  would  be  fine  but  that  they 
lack  the  condicoes  (conditions).  The  aphorism  that  sums  up  a 
common  attitude  about  doing  one's  duty  is,  "Ninguem  e  de  ferro" 
(No  one  is  made  of  iron).  The  relaxed  attitude  is  reinforced  by 
the  fact  that  laws  or  norms  are  often  seen  as  having  been 
imposed  from  the  outside,  rather  than  being  the  result  of  a 
social  contract  established  for  the  common  good.  Thus,  Brazil- 
ians, who  are  known  for  pragmatism,  have  become  adept  at  liv- 
ing with  idealistic  rules,  on  the  one  hand,  and  actual  practices 
that  are  often  quite  divergent,  on  the  other.  They  switch  easily 
between  different  cultural  codes  ranging  from  "traditional"  val- 
ues, such  as  machismo  and  paternalism,  to  "modern"  values 
and  social  norms  that  favor  women  and  equality. 

The  Brazilian  Way 

Despite  regional  and  social  class  variations,  the  Brazilian  way 
of  life  has  common  traits  that  distinguish  it  from  the  customary 
ways  of  dealing  with  people  and  situations  in  North  America 
and  Europe  and  even  in  other  Latin  American  countries.  Its 
uniqueness  seems  to  result  from  the  peculiar  blend  of  Portu- 
guese, African,  and  Amerindian  cultural  influences  in  a  setting 
in  which  central  authority  attempted,  without  great  success,  to 
exploit  the  people  and  resources  and  to  enforce  religious 
norms.  Under  these  circumstances,  it  was  preferable  to  appear 
to  obey  than  actually  to  obey. 

Many  attempts  have  been  made  to  explain  what  makes  Bra- 
zilians different  from  their  neighbors  in  the  Americas,  both 
North  and  South.  In  the  late  nineteenth  century,  Joaquim 
Maria  Machado  de  Assis,  one  of  Brazil's  greatest  writers, 
explored  the  subtleties  of  the  Brazilian  character,  focusing  on 
the  attempts  of  the  urban  middle  class  to  emulate  European 
lifestyles  and  aspirations.  In  the  1920s,  the  writer  Mario  de 
Andrade,  a  leader  of  the  modernist  movement  that  broke  with 
tradition  and  attempted  to  find  an  authentic  Brazilian  identity, 
created  the  archetypal  Brazilian  character,  Macunaima,  a  lazy 
but  ingenious  black-turned-white  Amazonian  who  migrated  to 
Sao  Paulo  and  was  a  "man  with  no  character."  In  the  following 
decade,  in  books  such  as  The  Masters  and  the  Slaves  (Casa 
Grande  e  Senzala)  and  The  Mansions  and  the  Shanties  (Sobrados 
e  Mocambos),  Gilberto  Freyre  emphasized  the  flexibility  of  the 
Portuguese,  as  well  as  the  African  roots  of  the  Northeasterners. 
Other  authors  characterized  the  Brazilian  as  homem  cordial  (cor- 


128 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


dial  man).  In  his  novels  and  stories,  Joao  Guimaraes  Rosa,  Bra- 
zil's greatest  writer  of  the  twentieth  century,  found  universal 
themes  in  the  contradictory  characters  and  peculiar  language 
of  men  and  women  deep  in  the  sertdo  backlands.  Novelist  Jorge 
Amado  focused  on  social  conflict,  local  color,  and  sensuality  in 
his  native  Bahia  State.  More  recently,  the  Brazilian  anthropolo- 
gist Roberto  da  Matta  explored  tensions  between  the  private 
and  public  spheres,  spontaneity,  and  authority,  as  well  as  senti- 
ment and  order  to  which  Brazilians  have  found  their  own  char- 
acteristic solutions. 

At  the  level  of  interpersonal  relations,  in  contrast  to  what  is 
usually  found  in  Spanish-speaking  Latin  America,  where  behav- 
ior tends  to  be  more  formal  and  rigid,  there  are  in  Brazil 
strong  cultural  values  in  favor  of  conciliation,  tolerance,  and 
cordiality.  To  the  extent  possible,  direct  personal  confrontation 
is  avoided.  This  Brazilian  style  of  behavior  may  be  derived  from 
an  Iberian  and  colonial  heritage  of  diverse  ethnic  groups  living 
together,  weaker  central  authority  exercised  by  the  Portuguese 
crown,  and  day-to-day  practical  forms  of  resistance  to  exploita- 
tion. It  may  also  have  an  element  of  popular  emulation  of  the 
genteel  behavior  of  the  elites.  Whatever  its  origins,  Brazilians 
are  known  for  their  informality,  good  nature,  and  charm  (sim- 
patia),  as  well  as  their  desire  not  to  be  thought  unpleasant  or 
boorish  (chato).  They  place  high  value  on  warmth,  spontaneity, 
and  lack  of  pomp  and  ceremony. 

Though  they  are  cordial  and  magnanimous  at  the  interper- 
sonal level,  Brazilians  as  a  whole  are  exploitative  with  regard  to 
the  environment.  This  attitude  has  been  explained  in  terms  of 
the  bandeirante  or  conquistador  mentality  by  authors  such  as 
Viana  Moog  and  Jorge  Wilheim.  According  to  this  interpreta- 
tion, the  general  spirit  of  the  colonizer  of  yesteryear  or  today  is 
to  accumulate  as  much  wealth  as  possible  as  quickly  as  possible 
and  then  move  on.  Whatever  its  roots,  the  result  of  this  kind  of 
behavior  is  individualism,  transience,  and  disregard  for  others 
and  for  nature  as  opposed  to  stability,  solidarity,  equilibrium, 
and  equity.  It  has  led  to  both  human  and  environmental  degra- 
dation. 

In  a  similar  fashion,  Brazilians  tend  not  to  think  in  terms  of 
the  common  good.  Discourse  invoking  mutual  benefit  for  all 
concerned  is  often  mistrusted  as  a  disguised  justification  for 
colonialism  or  exploitation.  The  result  of  widespread  evasion 
of  rules  imposed  by  the  central  authority  is  a  vicious  circle 
involving  crackdowns  and  inspections  (fiscalizacdo)  to  enforce 


129 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

ever-tougher  rules  and  ever  more  sophisticated  and  ingenious 
ways  of  evading  the  rules  (burla).  This  tendency  often  blocks 
the  efforts  of  those  who  are  well-intentioned,  without  creating 
major  obstacles  but  rather  making  their  work  easier  for  the 
truly  dishonest. 

This  nonconformity  with  illegitimate  authority  is  probablv 
an  origin  of  one  of  Brazil's  most  characteristic  and  original 
concepts,  summarized  in  the  word  jeito.  The  word  is  practically 
untranslatable  but  refers  to  ways  of  "cutting  red  tape,"  "bend- 
ing the  rules,"  "looking  the  other  way,"  or  an  alternative  "way 
out."  In  its  worst  form,  it  amounts  to  corruption.  At  its  best,  it 
means  finding  pragmatic  solutions  to  difficult  problems  with- 
out making  waves. 

Many  Brazilians  regard  soccer  and  Carnaval,  for  which  Brazil 
is  famous,  as  outlets  for  the  frustrations  of  everyday  life.  Brazil's 
three  world  soccer  championships  led  to  great  national  pride 
until  1970;  subsequent  losses  caused  twenty-four  years  of  frus- 
tration until  the  fourth  World  Cup  was  brought  home  in  1994. 
The  yearly  Carnaval  festivities  provide  for  short-lived  release 
and  relaxation. 

Another  form  of  release  is  through  imported  and  native 
music,  widely  disseminated  by  modern  communications.  The 
bossa  nova  of  the  1960s  was  replaced  by  the  lively  Brazilian 
rhythms  and  dance  movement  of  form,  lambada,  and  pagode. 

Language 

Language  is  one  of  the  strongest  elements  of  Brazil's 
national  unity.  Portuguese  is  spoken  by  nearly  100  percent  of 
the  population.  The  only  exceptions  are  some  members  of 
Amerindian  groups  and  pockets  of  immigrants,  primarily  from 
Japan  and  South  Korea,  who  have  not  yet  learned  Portuguese. 
The  principal  families  of  Indian  languages  are  Tupi,  Arawak, 
Carib,  and  Ge. 

There  is  about  as  much  difference  between  the  Portuguese 
spoken  in  Brazil  and  that  spoken  in  Portugal  as  between  the 
English  spoken  in  the  United  States  and  that  spoken  in  the 
United  Kingdom.  Within  Brazil,  there  are  no  dialects  of  Portu- 
guese, but  only  moderate  regional  variation  in  accent,  vocabu- 
lary, and  use  of  personal  nouns,  pronouns,  and  verb 
conjugations.  Variations  tend  to  diminish  as  a  result  of  mass 
media,  especially  national  television  networks  that  are  viewed 
by  the  majority  of  Brazilians. 


130 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


The  written  language,  which  is  uniform  all  over  Brazil,  fol- 
lows national  rules  of  spelling  and  accentuation  that  are 
revised  from  time  to  time  for  simplification.  They  are  slightly 
different  from  the  rules  followed  in  Portugal.  Written  Brazilian 
Portuguese  differs  significantly  from  the  spoken  language  and 
is  used  correctly  by  only  a  small,  educated  minority  of  the  pop- 
ulation. The  rules  of  grammar  are  complex  and  allow  more 
flexibility  than  English  or  Spanish.  Many  foreigners  who  speak 
Portuguese  fluently  have  difficulty  writing  it  properly. 

Because  of  Brazil's  size,  self-sufficiency,  and  relative  isolation, 
foreign  languages  are  not  widely  spoken.  English  is  often  stud- 
ied in  school  and  increasingly  in  private  courses.  It  has 
replaced  French  as  the  principal  second  language  among  edu- 
cated people.  Because  Spanish  is  similar  to  Portuguese,  most 
Brazilians  can  understand  it  and  many  can  communicate  in  it, 
although  Spanish  speakers  usually  have  difficulty  understand- 
ing spoken  Portuguese. 

Mass  Communications 

Under  the  military  governments  in  the  1970s,  Brazil's  state- 
owned  system  of  telecommunications  became  highly  devel- 
oped. The  telephone  system  was  modernized  by  means  of  mas- 
sive government  investments.  Long-distance  and  international 
calls,  which  had  been  difficult  to  make  and  hear  until  then, 
were  made  accessible  through  direct  dialing,  at  least  to  those 
who  could  afford  the  high  price  of  telephone  lines.  The  Postal 
and  Telegraph  Company  (Empresa  de  Correios  e  Telegrafos — 
ECT)  also  became  a  model  of  efficiency.  Some  of  the  quality  of 
telephone  and  postal  services  was  lost  in  the  1980s  and  early 
1990s. 

The  development  of  telecommunications  in  Brazil  was  origi- 
nally part  of  a  strategy  of  modernization  with  centralized  con- 
trol. However,  the  widespread  flow  of  information  contributed 
to  democratization  of  society  in  the  1980s  and  1990s,  a  process 
in  which  the  uncensored  press  played  a  key  role.  Censorship 
imposed  during  the  military  regime  was  lifted  during  the 
Figueiredo  administration.  The  press  is  owned  by  private  enter- 
prises, none  of  which  can  be  owned  or  controlled  by  foreign- 
ers; it  includes  dozens  of  daily  newspapers,  several  weekly 
magazines,  and  a  myriad  of  other  periodical  publications. 

Radio  and  television  stations  are  licensed  to  private  busi- 
nesses owned  by  Brazilians.  There  are  hundreds  of  radio  sta- 
tions all  over  the  country.  Television  became  widespread  in  the 


131 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

1970s,  with  several  national  networks  and  numerous  local  sta- 
tions in  all  states.  Television  sets  are  common  even  in  low- 
income  households.  Soap  operas  (telenovelas)  are  widely 
watched  and  are  a  common  topic  of  conversation.  It  is  a  sign  of 
their  high  technical  quality  that  these  programs  have  been  sold 
to  countries  all  over  the  world.  The  news  programs  often 
include  editorial  comment.  In  the  authoritarian  period,  this 
expression  of  opinion,  sometimes  in  subtle  ways,  tended  to  sup- 
port government.  In  the  1990s,  it  has  contributed  to  clearer 
notions  of  good  government  and  citizens'  rights  among  strata 
that  had  not  developed  political  consciousness,  but  it  may  also 
have  contributed  to  disillusionment. 

Family  and  Kinship 

The  Portuguese  crown  and  ecclesiastical  authorities  in  Brazil 
were  not  entirely  successful  in  implanting  their  ideals  with 
regard  to  marriage  and  the  patriarchal  family.  Brazilians  have 
limited  enthusiasm  for  official  norms  and  often  resort  to  con- 
sensual unions,  marital  dissolution,  serial  unions,  and  what  the 
Roman  Catholic  Church  generally  considers  to  be  lax  stan- 
dards of  behavior. 

At  the  same  time  that  many  of  them  bend  the  rules,  Brazil- 
ians place  high  value  on  family  and  kinship  relations.  These  are 
especially  valued  in  an  environment  in  which  authorities,  on 
the  one  hand,  and  one's  subordinates,  on  the  other,  are 
thought  to  be  untrustworthy.  Most  Brazilians  are  genuinely 
fond  of  children  and  are  attached  to  their  parents,  and  they 
cultivate  a  wide  circle  of  aunts,  uncles,  and  cousins.  In  the  past, 
relationships  with  godchildren,  godparents,  and  ritual  co-par- 
ents extended  these  networks,  but  they  are  losing  their  impor- 
tance in  modern  urban  society. 

Marital  separation  and  divorce  as  well  as  formal  and  infor- 
mal remarriage  are  now  commonplace.  Women  commonly 
head  their  own  households,  and  families  often  include  chil- 
dren from  different  marriages  or  unions.  The  new  arrange- 
ments are  socially  accepted  but  have  not  become  culturally 
institutionalized  in  the  sense  of  devising  new  terminology  for 
the  various  relationships. 

Religion 

Roman  Catholicism 

Brazil's  strong  Roman  Catholic  heritage  can  be  traced  to  the 


132 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Iberian  missionary  zeal,  with  the  fifteenth-century  goal  of 
spreading  Christianity  to  the  infidels.  In  the  New  World,  these 
included  both  Amerindians  and  African  slaves.  In  addition  to 
conversion,  there  were  also  strong  efforts  to  enforce  compli- 
ance with  Roman  Catholicism,  including  the  Inquisition,  which 
was  not  established  formally  in  Brazil  but  nonetheless  func- 
tioned widely  in  the  colonies.  In  the  late  nineteenth  century, 
the  original  Roman  Catholic  populace  of  Iberian  origin  was 
reinforced  by  a  large  number  of  Italian  Catholics  who  immi- 
grated to  Brazil,  as  well  as  some  Polish  and  German  Catholic 
immigrants. 

According  to  all  the  constitutions  of  the  republican  period, 
there  is  no  state  or  official  religion.  In  practice,  however,  sepa- 
ration of  church  and  state  is  weak.  Government  officials  gener- 
ally avoid  taking  action  that  may  offend  the  church. 

Brazil  is  said  to  be  the  largest  Roman  Catholic  country  in  the 
world.  In  1996  about  76  percent  of  the  population,  or  about 
122  million  people,  declared  Roman  Catholicism  as  their  reli- 
gion, as  compared  with  89  percent  in  1980.  The  decline  may 
have  resulted  from  a  combination  of  a  real  loss  of  influence 
and  a  tendency  to  be  more  objective  in  answering  census  ques- 
tions about  religion. 

As  in  most  dominant  religions,  there  is  some  distance 
between  nominal  and  practicing  Catholics.  Brazilians  usually 
are  baptized  and  married  in  the  Roman  Catholic  Church.  How- 
ever, according  to  the  CNBB  (National  Conference  of  Brazilian 
Bishops),  only  20  percent  of  nominal  Catholics  attend  Mass 
and  participate  in  church  activities,  but  the  figure  may  be  as 
low  as  10  percent.  Women  attend  Mass  more  often  than  men, 
and  the  elderly  are  more  active  in  church  than  the  young.  In 
the  1990s,  charismatic  forms  of  Catholicism  used  unconven- 
tional approaches,  along  the  line  of  those  used  by  Pentecostal 
Protestant  groups,  to  attempt  revitalization  and  increase  active 
participation. 

Popular  or  traditional  forms  of  Catholicism  are  widespread 
in  the  interior  of  the  country.  Many  Brazilians  pray  to  figures 
such  as  Padre  Cicero  (a  revered  priest  who  lived  in  Ceara  from 
1844  to  1934),  make  pilgrimages  to  the  site  of  the  appearance 
of  Brazil's  patron  saint,  our  Lady  of  the  Appearance  (Nossa 
Senhora  Aparecida),  and  participate  in  traditional  popular 
rites  and  festivities,  such  as  the  Cirio  in  Belem  and  the  Festa  do 
Divino  in  central  Brazil.  Some  use  expressions  of  religious  ori- 
gin, such  as  asking  for  a  blessing  on  meeting  someone  older  or 


133

responding  "God  willing"  (Se  Deusquiser)  when  someone  says 
"See  you  tomorrow." 

During  the  1970s,  the  progressive  wing  of  the  church  made 
an  "option  for  the  poor."  They  were  influenced  by  the  doctrine 
of  liberation  theology  (see  Glossary),  in  which  Brazilian  theolo- 
gians such  as  Leonardo  Boff  played  a  leading  role,  and  fol- 
lowed the  decision  of  the  Latin  American  Bishops'  Conference 
in  Medellin,  Colombia,  in  1968.  The  church  organized  Ecclesi- 
astical Base  Communities  (Comunidades  Eclesiais  de  Base — 
CEBs;  see  Glossary)  throughout  the  country  to  work  for  social 
and  political  causes  at  the  local  level.  During  the  military 
regime,  the  progressive  clergy  managed  to  make  the  church 
practically  the  only  legitimate  focus  of  resistance  and  defense 
of  human  rights.  In  the  early  1990s,  conservative  forces,  sup- 
ported by  Pope  John  Paul  II,  gained  power  in  the  church. 

Other  Religions 

Syncretism,  the  combination  of  different  forms  of  belief  or 
practice,  has  been  widespread  in  Brazil,  where  Roman  Catholi- 
cism has  blended  with  numerous  Afro-Brazilian  cults.  Syncre- 
tism occurred  partly  because  of  religious  persecution  and 
partly  because  of  the  compatibility  of  the  different  belief  sys- 
tems. The  most  well-known  and  socially  acceptable  combina- 
tions are  called  umbanda  or  candomble.  At  one  extreme, 
umbanda  blends  in  with  Kardecian  spiritualism  (see  Glossary). 
At  the  other  extreme,  there  is  a  kind  of  black  magic  called 
macumba,  which  can  be  used  for  either  good  or  evil  purposes. 
Its  practitioners  leave  offerings  of  chicken,  rum  (cachafd),  flow- 
ers, and  candles  at  crossroads,  beaches,  and  other  public 
places.  Kardecian  spiritists,  as  well  as  Mormons,  Jehovah's  Wit- 
nesses, Jews,  and  Buddhists,  together  account  for  about  3  to  5 
percent  of  the  population,  while  those  declaring  that  they  have 
no  religion  total  15  percent. 

In  recent  decades,  Protestantism  has  grown  rapidly.  The  pro- 
portion of  the  population  considered  evangelical  grew  from 
3.7  percent  in  1960  to  6.6  percent  in  1980.  The  1991  census 
showed  a  proportion  of  19.2  percent,  or  28.2  million  followers. 
Nearly  half  of  Brazil's  evangelicals,  or  13  million,  belong  to  the 
Assembly  of  God.  This  and  other  evangelical  or  Pentecostal 
varieties  of  Protestantism — Christian  Congregation,  Universal 
Church  of  the  Kingdom  of  God,  Quadrangular  Evangelicals, 
Brazil  for  Christ,  and  God  and  Love — emphasize  brotherhood 
and  religious  ceremonies  that  actively  engage  participants  in

song  and  chants.  The  groups  that  have  grown  the  most  are  fun- 
damentalists with  strict  standards  of  personal  behavior  regard- 
ing dress,  drinking,  smoking,  and  gambling.  They  have  special 
appeal  among  recent  migrants  to  urban  areas  or  to  the  fron- 
tier, who  have  had  to  adapt  to  new  and  difficult  circumstances. 
In  contrast  to  the  formality  and  central  control  of  the  Roman 
Catholic  Church,  the  fundamentalist  Protestant  groups  grow 
rapidly  and  split  and  multiply  frequently. 

Health  Status  and  Health  Care 

Indicators  of  Health 

In  1996  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme 
(UNDP),  which  worked  together  with  the  Applied  Economic 
Research  Institute  (Instituto  de  Pesquisa  Economica  Apli- 
cada — IPEA),  released  its  Human  Development  Report  1995  for 
Brazil.  Using  an  index  based  on  income,  education,  infant 
mortality,  and  other  socioeconomic  indicators,  the  report 
showed  that  Brazil  was  in  a  medium  human  development  posi- 
tion as  compared  with  other  countries.  It  suggested  that  the 
national  territory  could  be  divided  into  three  parts,  with  stan- 
dards of  living  similar  to  those  found  in  Belgium  (the  South 
and  Southeast),  Bulgaria  (Center-West  and  North),  and  India 
(Northeast). 

As  in  the  Human  Development  Report  1995,  infant  mortality 
rates  (deaths  of  children  less  than  one  year  of  age  per  1,000  live 
births)  often  are  used  as  indicators  of  living  conditions.  Since 
the  denominator  is  births,  they  are  not  affected  by  the  popula- 
tion's age  structure.  Because  of  underreporting  of  vital  statis- 
tics, they  must  be  estimated  from  census  data.  The  overall 
average  infant  mortality  rate  for  Brazil  declined  from  117  per 
1,000  live  births  to  eighty-eight,  according  to  the  1960  and 
1980  censuses,  respectively.  The  1991  census  showed  that  the 
rate  dropped  to  49.7  in  1991.  In  1995  the  estimated  rate  was 
44.4  per  1,000  live  births. 

As  usual,  national  averages  mask  wide  regional  and  socioeco- 
nomic variations.  As  in  previous  decades,  infant  mortality  levels 
in  1995  were  lowest  in  the  South,  at  21.1,  and  highest  in  the 
Northeast,  where  they  reached  70.2,  more  than  three  times 
higher.  In  recent  decades,  infant  mortality  generally  has  been 
higher  in  rural  areas,  except  for  the  poorest  urban  strata, 
whose  mortality  has  been  higher.  State  infant  mortality  rates 


136 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


fluctuate  from  year  to  year,  depending  on  economic  and  public 
health  conditions. 

The  sharp  drop  in  infant  mortality  in  recent  decades  did  not 
necessarily  reflect  a  commensurate  general  improvement  in  liv- 
ing conditions.  To  a  large  extent,  the  drop  was  the  result  of 
both  the  decline  in  fertility,  which  decreases  the  risk  of  infant 
deaths  for  biological  and  socioeconomic  reasons,  and  specific 
health  and  sanitation  interventions,  primarily  use  of  oral  rehy- 
dration and  extension  of  piped  water. 

Infectious  and  Chronic  Diseases 

Perinatal  conditions  were  responsible  for  47.1  percent  of 
total  infant  mortality,  ranking  first  among  the  causes  of 
reported  deaths  for  those  under  one  year  old  in  1988.  The 
leading  cause  of  mortality  among  children  one  to  four  years  of 
age,  at  24.5  percent  of  all  deaths  in  1988,  was  infectious  and 
parasitic  diseases,  particularly  diarrheal  diseases.  External 
causes,  specifically  traffic  accidents  and  homicide,  accounted 
for  the  greatest  share  of  registered  deaths  for  the  cohort  aged 
five  to  forty-nine.  Among  the  elderly  population  sixty  years  and 
above,  deaths  resulting  from  diseases  of  the  circulatory  system 
amounted  to  the  highest  percentage  (50.3)  of  the  total  in  1989. 
Those  diseases  were  also  the  leading  cause  of  mortality  for  the 
entire  nation,  with  higher  ratios  in  the  wealthier  Southeast 
(36.2  percent)  and  South  (37.2  percent),  relative  to  the  impov- 
erished North  (23.2  percent)  and  Northeast  (29.3  percent). 
Although  the  proportion  of  deaths  has  shifted  to  older  popula- 
tion groups,  regional  variations  continue  to  hold,  such  that 
over  a  quarter  of  deaths  afflicts  the  below-five  age  range  in  the 
North. 

Expanded  immunization  coverage  in  recent  years  has 
favored  a  drop  in  mortality  ascribed  to  vaccine-preventable  dis- 
eases, from  12.9  percent  in  1979  to  2.4  percent  in  1988.  In  1993 
vaccination  of  Brazilian  children  less  than  one  year  old  under 
the  National  Immunization  Program  reached  68.5  percent  for 
diphtheria,  pertussis,  and  tetanus,  92.3  percent  poliomyelitis, 
77.7  percent  measles,  and  98  percent  tuberculosis.  Although 
tuberculosis  persists  as  a  principal  source  of  morbidity  and 
mortality,  particularly  with  the  onset  of  the  human  immunode- 
ficiency virus  (HIV),  its  incidence  and  death  rates  have  been 
steadily  on  the  decline. 

Control  measures  have  proven  effective  in  reducing  the 
prevalence  and  outbreak  of  other  infectious  and  endemic  dis- 


137

eases,  including  cholera,  Chagas'  disease  (American  trypanoso- 
miasis), yellow  fever,  and  schistosomiasis  (bilharzia).  However, 
the  number  of  registered  cases  of  malaria,  which  42.9  percent 
of  the  Brazilian  population  is  at  risk  of  contracting  (mainly  in 
the  Amazon  region),  grew  from  52,000  cases  per  year  in  1970 
to  about  600,000  in  the  1980s,  with  some  improvement  since 
then.  Other  communicable  diseases  either  have  been  reintro- 
duced, as  in  the  case  of  dengue  (breakbone  fever)  since  1986. 
Infectious  tropical  diseases  reflect  poor  sanitary  conditions  as 
well  as  discrepancies  in  the  standard  of  living  between  North- 
ern and  Southern  Brazil,  where  such  diseases  ranked  third  and 
last,  respectively,  among  the  six  leading  causes  of  death  in 
1989. 

Leprosy  remains  a  serious  problem  in  Brazil's  high  poverty 
areas,  where  the  disease  is  spreading  most  rapidly.  In  October 
1996,  an  average  of  100  new  cases  were  being  reported  each 
day.  As  many  as  half  a  million  Brazilians  are  afflicted  with  lep- 
rosy. 

The  incidence  of  acquired  immune  deficiency  syndrome 
(AIDS)  in  Brazil  has  also  reached  epidemic  proportions,  from 
490  in  1985  to  103,262  cumulative  cases  by  March  1,  1997,  the 
fourth  highest  reported  prevalence  in  the  world.  Based  on 
1996  data  from  the  Pan  American  Health  Organization 
(PAHO),  homosexuals  and/or  bisexuals  constitute  45  percent 
of  the  cumulative  cases;  intravenous  drug  users,  27  percent: 
heterosexuals,  20  percent;  and  others,  8  percent.  The  inci- 
dence was  highest  among  young  adults;  60  percent  of  those  suf- 
fering from  AIDS  in  1994  were  in  the  twenty-five  to  thirty-nine 
age-group.  What  began  as  a  disease  of  homosexuals  and  recipi- 
ents of  blood  transfusions  quickly  spread  to  heterosexuals  and 
intravenous  drug  users.  HIV  infection  attributed  to  needle- 
sharing  during  drug  use  increased  from  3.0  percent  of  the 
cases  in  1986  to  24.5  percent  in  1992-93  and  from  5.0  percent 
to  23.4  percent  for  heterosexual  transmission,  altering  the 
male-to-female  ratio  from  100:1  in  the  1980s  to  4:1  in  1994. 
The  surge  in  the  proportion  of  women  contracting  the  virus 
has  resulted  in  part  from  a  rise  in  perinatal  transmission,  the 
predominant  mode  of  infection  for  the  12,000  infants  and  chil- 
dren diagnosed  with  AIDS  in  1994. 

The  overall  reduction  in  the  number  of  new  cases  of  the 
above  infectious  diseases,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  conspicu- 
ous rise  in  the  incidence  of  chronic  and  degenerative  diseases, 
on  the  other,  indicate  the  occurrence  of  an  epidemiological 


138 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


transition  in  Brazil.  However,  the  transition  is  not  complete; 
the  two  types  coexist  as  major  causes  of  death.  Diseases  of  the 
circulatory  system,  including  cerebrovascular  and  heart  dis- 
eases, currently  claim  first  place  as  the  leading  cause  of  death 
among  the  entire  population  (34.3  percent  in  1989).  The 
degenerative  diseases  have  contributed  to  steep  rises  in  the  cost 
of  health  care,  especially  for  the  elderly. 

Nutrition  and  Diet 

Inadequate  nutrition  serves  as  a  risk  factor  for  morbidity  and 
mortality  from  infectious  diseases.  Diarrheal  and  respiratory 
diseases,  measles,  tuberculosis,  and  malaria  are  the  principal 
causes  of  death  for  malnourished  children.  The  prevalence  of 
malnutrition  resulting  from  insufficient  protein-energy  diets 
among  children  under  five  years  in  Brazil  in  1990  was  13.0  per- 
cent. Nevertheless,  malnutrition  within  this  age-group  dropped 
substantially  (61.4  percent)  during  the  years  1975-88.  Chronic 
malnutrition  in  1989  characterized  15.4  percent  of  the  entire 
population.  The  Northeast  suffered  from  a  greater  rate  of 
chronic  malnutrition  (27.3  percent)  than  the  South  (8.1  per- 
cent). The  indigenous  population's  rate  was  twice  that  of  low- 
income  groups. 

Improvement  in  nutrition  has  been  accompanied  by 
changes  in  the  typical  Brazilian  diet.  The  staples  of  the  tradi- 
tional diet  in  Brazil  are  rice  and  beans,  supplemented  by  what- 
ever meat  may  be  available,  and  few,  if  any,  green  vegetables.  In 
the  Amazon  region,  the  staple  carbohydrate  is  manioc  meal, 
usually  eaten  with  fish.  Bread  and  pasta  have  become  impor- 
tant parts  of  the  diet  of  low-income  families,  especially  in  urban 
areas,  because  of  government  subsidies  for  wheat.  Advances  in 
poultry-raising  have  led  to  lower  prices  and  greater  consump- 
tion of  chicken  and  eggs  as  sources  of  protein.  Urban  and  rural 
workers  often  take  their  home-made  rice  and  bean  lunches  to 
work,  although  this  practice  in  urban  areas  is  being  replaced  by 
employer-provided  meal  tickets  for  use  in  restaurants  or  lun- 
cheonettes, including  fast-food  outlets. 

The  Health  Care  System 

The  constitution  of  1988  and  the  Organic  Health  Law  (Lei 
Organica  de  Saude)  of  1990  universalized  access  to  medical 
care,  unified  the  public  health  system  supported  by  the  Minis- 
try of  Health  and  the  National  Institute  for  Medical  Assistance 
and  Social  Security  (Instituto  Nacional  de  Assistencia  Medica 


139 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

da  Previdencia  Social — INAMPS),  and  decentralized  the  man- 
agement and  organization  of  health  services  from  the  federal 
to  the  state  and,  especially,  municipal  level.  Between  1985  and 
1990,  for  example,  the  proportion  of  program  funds  managed 
by  municipalities  increased  from  10  to  15  percent  and  by  states 
from  23  to  33  percent.  The  sweeping  health  reforms  that  were 
initiated  in  the  1980s  attempted  to  extend  coverage  to  those 
outside  the  social  security  system. 

The  constitution  grants  all  Brazilian  citizens  the  right  to  pro- 
cure free  medical  assistance  from  public  as  well  as  private  pro- 
viders reimbursed  by  the  government.  While  the  public 
domain  oversees  basic  and  preventive  health  care,  the  private 
nonprofit  and  for-profit  health  care  sector  delivers  the  bulk  of 
medical  services,  including  government-subsidized  inpatient 
care  (that  is,  private  facilities  owned  71  percent  of  hospital 
beds  designated  for  government-funded  health  care  in  1993). 
This  publicly  financed,  privately  provided  health  system  contin- 
ues to  intensify  its  focus  on  high-cost  curative  care,  driving  hos- 
pital costs  up  by  70  percent  during  the  1980s. 

Therapeutic  treatment  in  hospitals  tends  to  dominate  fund- 
ing at  the  expense  of  health  promotion  and  disease  prevention 
programs.  Hospital-based  assistance  expanded  from  44  percent 
(1985)  to  77  percent  (1990)  of  municipal  health  spending, 
while  expenses  for  primary  care  decreased  from  35  to  3  per- 
cent. Not  only  have  basic  and  preventive  health  services  for  the 
entire  population  diminished,  but  the  public  health  system  also 
subsidizes  expensive,  high-technology  medical  procedures  that 
consume  30  to  40  percent  of  health  resources  and  often  end 
up  being  used  to  attend  affluent  segments  of  the  population. 
Despite  an  augmentation  in  hospital  coverage,  discrepancies  in 
access  and  quality  of  health  care  among  the  five  regions  charac- 
terize the  Single  Health  System  (Sistema  Unico  de  Saude — 
SUS);  medical  consultations  average  1.3  per  capita  in  the 
Northeast  versus  2.3  in  the  Southeast. 

Although  states  and  municipalities  rapidly  acquired  more 
responsibility  in  administering  health  funds  and  facilities,  the 
federal  government  retained  the  role  of  financing  public 
health  outlays.  As  stipulated  by  the  1988  constitution,  govern- 
ment subsidies  for  health  services  are  derived  from  the  social 
security  budget,  which  is  predominantly  based  on  earmarked 
taxes  and  contributions  from  employee  payroll  and  business 
profits.  The  federal  government  consistently  underwrote  over 
three-quarters  of  all  public  spending  on  health  in  the  1980s,  a

sizable  portion  of  which  remunerated  private  medical  charges. 
The  percentage  of  total  central  government  spending  on 
health  in  1990  was  6.7.  Public  health  expenditures  as  a  share  of 
gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glossary)  in  1990  ranged 
from  2.1  to  3.1  percent,  close  to  half  of  the  total  health  expen- 
ditures of  5.8  percent. 

Private  sources  finance  the  other  half  of  total  health  expen- 
ditures. Perceptions  of  inefficiency  in  the  government  reim- 
bursement schedule  and  deterioration  in  service  quality  of  the 
public  health  system  spurred  a  rapid  growth  in  the  private 
financing  of  health  care  during  the  1980s,  particularly  in  well- 
developed  cities  of  the  Southeast.  The  private  sector  covers  32 
million  citizens  (roughly  20  percent  of  the  Brazilian  popula- 
tion) and  consists  of  several  hundred  firms  offering  four  prin- 
cipal types  of  medical  plans:  private  health  insurance,  prepaid 


141

group  practice,  medical  cooperatives,  and  company  health 
plans.  The  group  medical  plans  rank  Brazil  as  the  largest 
health  maintenance  organization  (HMO)  provider  in  Latin 
America;  HMOs  both  finance  and  provide  health  care,  but 
limit  coverage  to  low-cost  procedures  and  drive  the  burden  of 
treating  high-risk  individuals  to  the  publicly  funded  health  sys- 
tem. 

Health  Professionals  and  Resources 

Paralleling  private  insurance,  human  resources  are  dispro- 
portionately distributed  in  Brazil,  with  overrepresentation  in 
the  wealthy  states.  A  strong  demand  for  physicians  persists  in 
the  Amazon  region,  while  61.5  percent  of  doctors  are  located 
in  the  Southeast.  Physicians  also  dominate  the  health  field, 
comprising  46.8  percent  of  the  work  force  and  serving  an  aver- 
age of  847  people  per  doctor  between  1988  and  1991,  while 
nurses  (one  for  every  3,448  people)  and  other  auxiliary  per- 
sonnel lag  behind  in  supply. 

Although  most  health  establishments  belong  to  the  public 
sector  (65.2  percent  public  and  34.8  percent  private),  more 
private  institutions  (43.2  percent)  provide  inpatient  care  than 
public  (6.8  percent).  These  establishments  range  from  federal, 
state,  municipal,  and  university  hospitals  and  health  posts  to 
private  clinics.  The  distribution  of  hospitals  and  outpatient 
facilities  favors  the  South  and  Southeast,  at  levels  two  to  four 
times  higher  per  capita  than  in  the  North  and  Northeast, 
where  health  conditions  are  more  precarious  and  the  need  for 
health  care  is  greater.  The  ratio  of  hospital  beds  per  1,000  pop- 
ulation has  remained  fairly  constant  between  1985  (3.9)  and 
1990  (3.6),  and  is  33  percent  higher  than  predicted  in  relation 
to  Brazil's  gross  national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary). 

Brazil  has  adopted  new  medical  technologies  from  industri- 
alized countries.  However,  specialized  and  high-technology  ser- 
vices benefit  a  minority  of  privileged  patients.  Many  poor 
Brazilians,  unable  to  afford  hospital-based  medical  care,  rely 
on  both  prescription  and  nonprescription  medication  to 
relieve  their  ailments.  The  national  pharmaceutical  market  in 
1990  was  valued  at  close  to  US$4  billion,  70.5  percent  of  which 
was  earned  by  commercial  pharmacies.  Judging  from  the  dis- 
proportionate availability  of  drugs  and  medical  equipment  to 
different  income  groups,  universal  and  equitable  access  to 
health  care  remains  a  goal  to  be  reached.

The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Public  Health  and  Welfare 

Social  Security 

The  Ministry  of  Social  Security,  now  separate  from  the  Bra- 
zilian health  system  as  discussed  above,  carries  out  the  conven- 
tional mandate  of  ensuring  old-age  assistance.  Until  the  1940s, 
social  security  was  limited  to  private  plans  organized  by  employ- 
ers and  employees.  Over  time,  the  components  of  the  system 
became  increasingly  integrated  and  controlled  by  the  federal 
government.  More  recently,  health  benefits  and  social  security 
have  become  nearly  universal,  no  longer  depending  on  formal 
employment  and  contributions.  Retirement  and  disability  ben- 
efits are  pegged  to  the  official  minimum  wage.  They  weigh  so 
heavily  on  government  spending  that  they  are  one  of  the  rea- 
sons the  government  resists  raising  the  minimum  wage  for  the 
active  work  force.  At  the  same  time,  the  middle  class  considers 
these  benefits  insufficient  and,  therefore,  seeks  private  social 
security  plans  or  makes  investments  in  real  estate,  given  the 
instability  of  financial  markets  in  Brazil.  The  social  security  sys- 
tem will  face  even  greater  challenges  as  the  age  structure  of  the 
population  changes,  with  a  greater  number  of  pensioners  in 
relation  to  the  number  of  contributing  workers. 

Sanitation  and  Public  Utilities 

The  National  Sanitation  Plan  (Piano  Nacional  de  Sanea- 
mento — Planasa)  of  the  1970s  did  not  keep  pace  with  rapid 
urbanization  in  the  development  of  safe  drinking  water  sup- 
plies and  waste  disposal  systems,  particularly  evident  in  the  pre- 
carious metropolitan  peripheries  and  favelas.  Between  1988 
and  1993,  87  percent  had  access  to  piped  water  and  72  percent 
to  sewerage  and  waste  disposal  services,  yet  a  1989  study  by  the 
IBGE  (Brazilian  Geography  and  Statistics  Institute)  revealed 
that  92  percent  of  the  municipalities  did  not  treat  domestic 
wastewater  and  only  27.6  percent  of  dwellings  in  a  Northeast 
metropolis  were  linked  to  a  sewerage  system  that  passed  quality 
standards. 

The  rural  population  receives  far  fewer  water  and  sanitation 
services  than  its  urban  counterparts.  Ninety-five  percent  of 
those  in  urban  areas  had  adequate  water  supply  during  the 
1988-93  period,  as  compared  with  61  percent  of  rural  dwellers; 
the  levels  for  disposal  systems  were  84  percent  and  32  percent, 
respectively  (the  rural  figures  refer  to  wells  and  privies,  not  ser- 


143 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

vice).  To  a  certain  extent,  the  urban-rural  incongruity  in  the 
provision  of  environmental  sanitation  accounts  for  the  higher 
percentage  of  deaths  from  diarrheal  diseases  in  the  rural  North 
and  Northeast  than  in  the  urban  areas.  The  lack  or  deficiency 
of  basic  sanitation  services  has  been  associated  with  the  persis- 
tence of  diarrhea  as  well  as  outbreaks  of  contagious  diseases, 
including  cholera. 

Housing 

The  National  Housing  Bank  (Banco  Nacional  de  Habi- 
tacao — BNH)  was  established  in  the  1960s  to  finance  public 
housing  using  funds  from  savings  accounts  and  from  the  offi- 
cial employment  guarantee  system,  known  as  the  Severance  Pay 
Fund  (Fundo  de  Garantia  do  Tempo  de  Servico — FGTS). 
Many  thousands  of  basic  houses  (casas  populares)  were  built, 
usually  in  projects  at  the  edges  or  outside  of  cities.  Because  of 
the  financial  constraints  of  working  with  a  low-income  clien- 
tele, the  federal  Housing  Finance  System  (Sistema  Financeiro 
de  Habitacao — SFH)  has  been  used  primarily  to  provide  low- 
cost  mortgages  for  houses  and  apartments  for  the  middle  class. 

Many  poor  people,  without  access  to  financing,  find  it  neces- 
sary to  build  their  own  houses.  The  favelas  on  the  hills  of  Rio 
de  Janeiro  are  one  well-known  type.  In  other  parts  of  Brazil, 
shantytowns  on  stilts  are  built  over  water  (alagados) ,  or  in 
marshy  areas  (baixadas) .  In  1991  there  were  3,221  medium-  to 
large-size  favelas  (each  with  more  than  fifty-one  households), 
which  contained  2.9  percent  of  the  country's  households.  The 
largest  favelas,  such  as  Rocinha  in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  are  home  to 
hundreds  of  thousands. 

Education 

As  in  other  areas  of  social  life,  education  in  Brazil  is  marked 
by  great  inequalities,  with  a  highly  developed  university  system 
at  one  extreme  and  widespread  illiteracy  at  the  other.  Despite 
considerable  progress  in  coverage,  serious  problems  of  quality 
remain.  In  1995  the  federal  government  was  spending  almost 
twice  as  much  on  the  universities  as  on  basic  education,  which 
is  the  primary  responsibility  of  states  and  municipalities.  Local 
governments  often  paid  teachers  wages  that  were  well  below 
the  legal  minimum. 

In  1990  there  were  37.6  million  students,  as  compared  with 
10  million  in  1964.  Of  the  1990  total,  3.9  million  students  were

in  preschool,  29.4  million  in  elementary  school,  3.7  million  in 
secondary  school,  and  1.7  million  in  university.  Despite  this 
progress,  less  than  40  percent  of  the  high  school-age  popula- 
tion was  enrolled  in  school. 

Because  of  the  economic  and  social  changes  that  have 
occurred  in  Brazil  in  recent  decades,  parents  now  place  high 
value  on  education  for  their  children.  Availability  of  schools 
has  become  an  important  factor  in  deciding  where  to  live  and 
how  to  make  a  living,  even  in  how  many  children  to  have. 

Literacy 

In  1990  it  was  estimated  that  81  percent  of  the  total  popula- 
tion above  age  fifteen  was  literate,  or  19  percent  illiterate 


145 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

(based  on  the  inability  to  sign  one's  own  name).  The  level  of 
functional  illiteracy — that  is,  the  inability  to  read  newspapers 
and  write  letters — was  not  measured  but  was  certainly  much 
higher  (an  estimated  60  percent).  As  with  most  social  indica- 
tors, illiteracy  is  highest  in  rural  areas  of  the  Northeast  and 
North,  where  the  figures  are  comparable  to  those  in  Africa, 
and  lowest  in  urban  areas  of  the  Southeast  and  South,  where 
the  figures  are  comparable  with  those  in  the  developed  world. 
For  example,  southern  towns  had  an  adult  illiteracy  rate  of  only 
10  percent  in  1991,  while  the  rate  for  children  between  the 
ages  of  eleven  and  fourteen  was  only  3  percent. 

Literacy  is  strongly  associated  with  income.  When  the  popu- 
lation is  divided  into  five  income  strata,  illiteracy  is  ten  times 
greater  in  the  stratum  with  the  lowest  income.  The  illiteracy 
rate  rises  by  age-  group.  The  1991  census  also  showed  a  strong 
racial  gradient,  with  illiteracy  levels  of  11.6  percent  among 
whites,  27.4  percent  among  mulattoes,  and  29.9  percent 
among  blacks.  Differences  by  gender  were  not  strong.  Because 
of  disappointing  results  when  the  federal  government  under- 
took a  nationwide  adult  literacy  campaign,  the  Brazilian  Liter- 
acy Movement  (Movimento  Brasileiro  de  Alfabetizacao — 
Mobral),  the  emphasis  shifted  in  the  1960s  and  1970s  to  reach- 
ing children  through  the  school  system. 

Primary  and  Secondary  Schools 

In  theory,  public  education  is  free  at  all  levels  in  Brazil  and  is 
compulsory  for  ages  seven  to  fourteen,  but  coverage  is  incom- 
plete and  quality  uneven.  Private  schools  continue  to  meet  a 
large  part  of  the  demand  of  those  who  can  afford  to  pay.  Gen- 
erally speaking,  the  private  primary  and  secondary  schools  are 
for  the  upper  and  middle  classes,  while  the  public  schools  at 
these  levels  are  attended  by  those  in  the  lower  socioeconomic 
strata.  During  the  1990s,  rising  costs  and  economic  pressures 
made  it  necessary  for  some  of  the  middle  class  to  shift  from  pri- 
vate to  public  schools. 

The  system  of  primary  and  secondary  schools  was  restruc- 
tured during  the  1970s  and  1980s  to  consist  of  eight  years  of 
basic  ("fundamental")  education  and  three  years  of  secondary 
school.  The  public  schools  at  these  levels  are  run  by  municipal- 
ities and  states.  In  1990  the  Collor  government  adopted  a  sys- 
tem of  integrated  educational  centers,  which  included  day 
care,  school  lunches,  and  health  care,  called  Integrated  Cen- 
ters for  Assistance  to  Children  (Centros  Integrados  de  Assisten- 


146 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


cia  a  Crianca — CIACs)  and  later  renamed  Centers  for 
Comprehensive  Attention  to  Children  (Centros  de  Atencao 
Integrada  a  Crianca — CAICs) .  These  centers  were  based  on  the 
model  developed  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  State  by  the  administration 
of  Leonel  de  Moura  Brizola,  then  governor  of  the  state.  How- 
ever, because  of  limited  funds  they  could  not  be  implemented 
throughout  the  country,  and  the  validity  of  concentrating 
resources  on  a  small  number  of  beneficiaries  was  questioned. 

Between  1960  and  1990,  enrollment  rates  for  school-age 
children  (seven  to  fourteen)  increased  from  50  percent  to  90 
percent  for  the  country  as  a  whole.  They  varied  considerably 
from  one  region  or  state  to  another  and  within  regions  and 
states.  Coverage  was  highest  in  the  Southeast  and  South  and 
lowest  in  the  Northeast.  There  were  also  racial  differences. 
According  to  1985  data,  91.4  percent  of  white  children  ages 
seven  to  nine  were  in  school,  as  compared  with  only  74.6  per- 
cent of  black  children  of  those  ages. 

One  of  the  biggest  educational  problems  in  Brazil  is  school 
nonattendance.  In  wealthy  states,  95  percent  of  children  enroll 
from  the  start,  while  only  65  percent  to  80  percent  enroll  in 
poor  states.  Approximately  25  percent  drop  out  by  the  second 
year.  UNICEF  reported  in  mid-1994  that  Brazil  is  in  last  place 
in  a  world  ranking  that  compares  the  per  capita  income  of 
each  country  with  the  rates  of  school  nonattendance  or  absen- 
teeism in  the  first  five  grades.  Given  Brazil's  considerable  eco- 
nomic strength,  one  would  expect  at  least  80  percent  of  the 
children  to  complete  the  fifth  grade,  but  only  39  percent  fin- 
ish, according  to  the  UNICEF  report.  Often  children  from 
poor  families  start  working  from  the  age  of  ten  in  order  to  help 
their  parents.  Other  reasons  for  school  nonattendance  include 
inadequate  school  facilities,  the  high  examination  failure  rate, 
and  malnutrition. 

One  of  the  government  initiatives  at  the  national  level  that 
has  improved  attendance  and  nutrition  is  the  school  lunch  pro- 
gram. Some  local  governments,  such  as  that  of  the  Federal  Dis- 
trict, have  experimented  with  providing  payments  to  poor 
families  of  children  who  stay  in  school. 

Colleges  and  Universities 

The  system  of  colleges  and  universities  expanded  rapidly  in 
the  1970s  and  1980s,  reaching  a  total  of  893  in  1993.  Of  these, 
ninety-nine  were  universities  and  794  were  isolated  colleges  or 
schools.  Nearly  all  states  have  federal  universities.  The  state 


147 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 


universities  are  less  widespread,  while  the  few  municipal  uni- 
versities or  colleges  are  concentrated  in  large  cities  in  the 
Southeast  and  South.  The  Southeast  Region  has  nearly  two- 
thirds  of  the  country's  colleges  and  universities.  The  number  of 
undergraduate  students  admitted  in  Brazil  in  1990  was 
407,148,  of  which  14.1  percent  were  in  federal  universities,  10.9 
percent  in  state  universities,  5.9  percent  in  municipal  universi- 
ties, and  69.0  percent  in  private  institutions.  The  total  number 
of  students  enrolled  was  about  1.5  million,  and  the  number  of 
graduates  was  230,000. 

The  best  universities  in  Brazil  generally  include  the  Univer- 
sity of  Sao  Paulo  (Universidade  de  Sao  Paulo — USP),  the 
Campinas  State  University  (Universidade  Estadual  de  Campi- 
nas— Unicamp),  the  Federal  University  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  (Uni- 
versidade Federal  do  Rio  de  Janeiro — UFRJ),  the  University  of 
Brasilia  (Universidade  de  Brasilia — UnB),  and  the  Federal  Uni- 
versity of  Minas  Gerais  (Universidade  Federal  de  Minas 
Gerais — UFMG),  all  of  which  are  public.  The  private  Pontifical 
Catholic  University  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  (Pontiffcia  Universidade 
Catolica  do  Rio  de  Janeiro — PUC-RJ)  is  also  highly  ranked. 
Public  universities  are  free  and  do  not  charge  tuition.  Private 
colleges  and  universities,  which  charge  tuition,  grew  very  rap- 
idly during  the  1970s  to  meet  the  enormous  demands  of  a 
growing  middle  class. 

Because  of  the  great  demand  for  higher  education  and  the 
limited  resources,  both  public  and  private  colleges  (faculdades) 
and  universities  in  Brazil  require  an  entrance  examination  ( ves- 
tibular). Passing  these  examinations  often  necessitates  private 
college-preparatory  courses,  which  only  the  upper  and  middle 
socioeconomic  strata  can  afford.  On  completion  of  a  full  aca- 
demic course  of  study,  university  students  may  obtain  a  bache- 
lor's degree  (bacharelado)  and  may  also  study  an  additional  year 
to  receive  a  teaching  degree  ( licenciatura) . 

The  choice  of  majors  or  specialties  is  not  well-aligned  with 
the  job  market.  According  to  a  1993  IPEA  study,  two  out  of 
three  students  were  in  the  social  sciences  or  humanities,  as 
opposed  to  scientific  or  technical  fields.  The  study  also  con- 
cluded that  four  out  of  ten  students  dropped  out  before  gradu- 
ation and  that  those  who  graduated  took  an  average  of  eight 
years  to  finish.  Many  of  these  had  difficulty  paying  for  tuition, 
or  living  expenses,  and  many  who  gave  up  before  graduation 
realized  that  they  were  not  being  well  prepared  for  the  job  mar- 
ket (see  Research  and  Development,  ch.  6). 


148 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


Graduate  study  grew  rapidly  during  the  1970s  and  1980s.  In 
1991  Brazil  had  973  master's  programs  in  almost  all  areas,  with 
39,401  students,  as  well  as  465  doctoral  programs  with  12,862 
students.  Because  of  this  growth,  along  with  budget  constraints, 
the  government  restricted  fellowships  for  university  study 
abroad,  which  had  made  it  possible  for  about  20,000  Brazilians 
to  obtain  their  advanced  degrees  in  the  United  States  and 
Europe. 

Principal  Research  Libraries 

The  strongest  university  libraries  are  at  USP,  UFRJ,  and  UnB. 
Researchers  also  have  access  to  the  National  Library  (Biblio- 
teca  Nacional)  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  the  Library  of  Congress  of 
Brazil  (Biblioteca  do  Congresso  do  Brasil)  in  Brasilia.  The 
National  Library  is  the  equivalent  of  the  United  States  Library 
of  Congress,  but  the  Library  of  Congress  of  Brazil  is  increas- 
ingly important.  Brazilian  libraries  gradually  are  becoming 
computerized  and  linked  to  international  information  net- 
works. 

Social  Conflict  and  Participation 

Conflict  and  Nonviolence 

While  avoiding  open  conflict,  Brazilian  society  has  gone 
through  transitions  that  in  general  have  moved  in  the  direction 
of  modernization  and  democracy.  Considering  the  decimation 
of  Indian  populations  and  the  maintenance  of  African  slavery 
long  after  it  had  been  abolished  elsewhere  in  the  Americas, 
Brazil's  colonial  and  imperial  history  was  characterized  by  vio- 
lence. At  the  same  time,  however,  there  is  a  strong  Brazilian  tra- 
dition of  nonviolent  resolution  of  conflicts.  There  was  no  war 
of  independence  against  Portugal,  but  only  local  or  regional 
conflicts,  such  as  the  Cabanagem  (1835)  in  the  Amazon,  the 
War  of  the  Farrapos  (1845)  in  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  and  the  Sao 
Paulo  Civil  War  (1932)  (see  The  Empire,  1822-89;  The  Repub- 
lican Era,  1889-1985,  ch.  1).  Although  Brazil  participated  in 
the  Paraguayan  War,  also  known  as  the  War  of  the  Triple  Alli- 
ance (1864-70),  most  conflicts  with  neighboring  countries 
were  solved  peacefully.  The  transition  from  empire  to  republic 
in  1889  was  also  relatively  smooth.  There  was  no  generalized 
civil  war,  but  there  were  isolated  events,  such  as  the  resistance 
of  a  millenarian  group  at  Canudos  in  the  Northeast,  described 
in  Euclydes  da  Cunha's  classic  Os  sertdes,  translated  as  Rebellion

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

in  the  Backlands.  In  contrast  to  Spanish  America,  which  fought 
protracted  revolutionary  wars  and  split  into  many  separate 
countries,  Portuguese  America  held  together  in  one  huge 
country.  Although  there  were  many  violent  episodes,  Brazilian 
history,  on  the  whole,  has  been  remarkably  peaceful. 

Despite  its  nonbelligerent  heritage  at  the  national  level,  Bra- 
zilian life  is  marked  by  considerable  violence  on  a  day-to-day 
basis.  Indians  and  slaves,  or  their  descendants,  have  always 
been  victimized.  The  rural  bandits  (cangaceiros)  of  the  North- 
east, of  whom  Lampiao  is  the  most  famous,  battled  rival  groups 
and  backlands  colonels  in  the  early  1900s.  In  the  post-World 
War  II  period,  the  struggle  for  land  pitted  rural  workers  and 
their  leaders  against  the  landowners  and  their  hired  gunmen, 
resulting  in  the  murder  of  leaders  and  even  priests,  most  nota- 
bly in  frontier  areas.  Chico  Mendes,  a  rubber-tapper  leader 
killed  in  Acre  in  1988,  was  the  most  widely  known  among  hun- 
dreds of  victims.  In  1995  and  1996,  there  were  massacres  of 
landless  workers  in  Rondonia  and  Para.  In  urban  areas,  espe- 
cially the  largest,  violence  has  become  commonplace,  with  fre- 
quent thefts,  robberies,  break-ins,  assaults,  and  kidnappings. 
The  police  themselves  are  sometimes  involved  in  criminal  activ- 
ities. In  Rio  de  Janeiro,  the  government  has  little  control  over 
the  favelas,  which  are  dominated  by  gangs  that  control  infor- 
mal gambling  (a  numbers  game  called  jogo  do  bicho)  and  drug 
trafficking  as  well  as  influence  local  politics. 

For  the  most  part,  contemporary  violence  cannot  easily  be 
construed  as  a  class  struggle,  at  least  as  a  struggle  that  involves 
collective  consciousness  and  action.  It  is  essentially  particularis- 
tic and  opportunistic  at  the  individual  level,  although  it  often 
reflects  perceptions  of  social  injustice.  Avoidance  of  more  orga- 
nized conflict  between  the  privileged  and  the  poor  in  Brazil 
can  be  attributed  in  part  to  the  corporatist  (see  Glossary)  sys- 
tem set  up  during  the  regime  of  Getulio  Dorneles  Vargas  (pres- 
ident, 1930-45,  1951-54)  in  the  1930s  and  1940s.  This  system 
was  designed  to  preempt  direct  class  confrontation  through 
well-controlled  concessions  to  workers.  The  system  of  govern- 
ment-regulated labor  unions  and  clientelism  (see  Glossary) 
reached  its  limits  in  the  1960s.  In  1964  a  bloodless  military 
coup  prevented  it  from  going  farther  in  the  direction  of  the 
dispossessed. 

The  authoritarian  military  regime,  which  lasted  from  1964 
until  1985,  used  torture  and  killing  to  repress  opposition, 
including  cases  of  armed  struggle  between  1966  and  1975,  but

was  gradually  worn  down  by  democratic  pressures  and  sheer 
fatigue.  From  1976  until  1994,  political  efforts  on  the  right  and 
the  left  focused  on  redemocratization,  with  greater  popular 
participation.  Revolution  and  repression  were  set  aside.  Once 
again,  a  major  transition  occurred  with  relatively  little  violence, 
at  least  as  compared  with  Chile  and  Argentina,  for  example. 

Growth  of  Social  and  Environmental  Movements 

In  contrast  to  developed  countries,  Brazil  had  few  organiza- 
tions— interest  groups,  associations,  leagues,  clubs,  and 
NGOs — up  until  the  1970s.  This  lack  of  mediation  between 
government  and  society  was  characteristic  of  a  paternalistic 
and  authoritarian  social  structure  with  a  small  but  powerful 
elite  and  a  dispossessed  majority.  During  the  1970s  and  early 
1980s,  however,  in  part  because  of  the  growth  of  the  middle 
class,  a  wide  variety  of  social  movements  and  local  and  national 
organizations  appeared  and  expanded.  Many  engaged  in  some 
kind  of  political  activity.  Women's  groups  also  appeared. 
Increasingly,  social  and  political  organizations  reached  into  the 
lower  classes.  A  significant  number  were  connected  directly  or 


151 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

indirectly  to  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  which  sponsored 
CEBs  (Ecclesiastical  Base  Communities)  as  part  of  its  "option 
for  the  poor."  Independent  labor  movements  also  grew  during 
the  1980s.  People  took  to  the  streets  in  1984  to  press  for  direct 
elections  for  president,  as  they  did  in  1992  to  demand  the 
impeachment  of  President  Collor  de  Mello. 

Once  a  new  constitution  was  written  in  1988  and  a  president 
was  chosen  through  direct  elections  in  1989,  opposition  or 
resistance  movements  were  forced  to  redefine  their  roles.  Many 
of  them  made  a  transition  from  protest  and  denunciation  to 
providing  more  constructive  contributions  in  the  areas  of 
health,  education,  and  social  services.  Others  organized  pres- 
sure on  government  agencies.  A  1994  study  showed  that  some 
5,000  NGOs  are  dedicated  to:  the  environment  (40  percent), 
social  change  (17  percent),  women's  causes  (15  percent),  and 
racial  issues  (11  percent),  among  other  causes  (17  percent).  As 
a  rule,  these  movements  are  organized  around  the  interests  of 
neighborhoods  or  broad  concerns  that  cut  across  social  class 
lines.  Most  are  small,  voluntary  organizations  that  operate  at 
the  local  level  and  provide  assistance,  but  there  are  also  large 
professional  NGOs,  such  as  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Social  and 
Economic  Analysis  (Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Analise  Social  e 
Economica — IBASE)  and  the  Federation  of  Social  and  Educa- 
tional Assistance  Agencies  (Federacao  de  Orgaos  para  Assisten- 
cia  Social).  Some  of  the  large  NGOs  are  connected  to 
international  NGOs,  and  many  receive  donations  from  abroad 
(dues  are  not  customary).  Various  associations  of  national  and 
regional  NGOs  have  also  developed. 

Collaboration  between  social  and  environmental  move- 
ments, in  what  has  been  called  "socio-environmentalism," 
reflects  a  Brazilian  belief  that  concerns  with  the  environment 
are  inseparable  from  concerns  with  development,  social  equity, 
and  justice.  In  this  view,  human  and  environmental  degrada- 
tion have  common  causes,  and  their  solution  requires  the 
same  sort  of  action. 

Inclusion  and  Exclusion 

Critical  interpretations  of  Brazil's  social  situation  in  the 
1980s  and  1990s  point  to  what  is  seen  as  a  deepening  of  the 
economic  crisis  and  the  growth  of  misery  and  hunger.  These 
interpretations  are  based  on  a  series  of  observations  and  evi- 
dence that  includes  loss  of  value  of  the  real  minimum  wage  as  a 
result  of  inflation,  high  unemployment  levels,  widespread 


152 


The  Society  and  Its  Environment 


informal  economic  activity,  cutbacks  in  government  spending 
on  social  programs,  and  mapping  of  indigence  carried  out  by 
IPEA  in  1990.  They  also  take  into  account  the  more  visible 
signs  of  discrimination  and  deprivation,  such  as  favelas,  camps 
of  landless  workers,  urban  violence,  street  children,  and  epi- 
demics of  diseases  such  as  cholera  and  dengue. 

However,  social  indicators  on  such  phenomena  as  infant 
mortality,  school  enrollment,  piped  water,  nutritional  status, 
and  protein  consumption  improved  significantly  in  the  1980s 
and  early  1990s.  The  improvements  have  resulted  in  no  small 
measure  from  government  investments  in  the  social  area  since 
the  1970s.  These  have  been  called  "compensatory  social  poli- 
cies" because  they  seem  to  have  been  designed  to  compensate 
for  the  economic  policies  that  favor  income  concentration. 
Although  they  were  insufficient,  the  investments  had  unques- 
tionably positive  effects.  To  some  extent,  the  benefits  also  can 
be  attributed  to  fertility  decline,  which  has  biological  and  socio- 
economic effects,  and  to  technological  development  in  the 
areas  of  health  services  and  food  production. 

The  apparent  contradiction  between  negative  and  positive 
socioeconomic  trends  can  be  explained  in  part  by  the  greater 
visibility  of  poverty,  which  has  grown  most  in  urban  areas,  while 
the  above-mentioned  benefits  are  more  diffuse  and  less  visible. 
However,  the  problems  are  not  only  because  of  perceptions  or 
misreadings.  The  basic  explanation  for  the  contradiction  is  the 
coexistence  of  simultaneous  processes  of  inclusion  and  exclu- 
sion. Inclusion  resulted  from  extension  to  the  lower  middle 
class,  by  means  of  the  labor  and  consumer  markets  and  public 
services,  of  some  of  the  benefits  of  development  previously 
restricted  to  the  upper  and  upper-middle  strata.  They  have 
gained  from  participation  in  the  labor  market  or  markets  for 
their  goods  and  services  and  from  government-provided  ser- 
vices, such  as  education,  health,  and  sanitation.  In  the  simplest 
terms,  the  quantity  of  coverage  has  increased,  although  serious 
problems  of  quality  remain,  and  the  lowest  strata  continue  to 
be  excluded  from  integral  participation  in  markets  and  full 
access  to  government  services. 

The  perception  of  crisis  is  accentuated  by  the  fact  that  social 
mobility  slowed  down  considerably  in  relation  to  the  rapid 
expansion  of  the  upper  middle  class  in  the  1960s  and  1970s. 
According  to  national  surveys  of  household  expenditures,  47 
percent  of  the  heads  of  household  questioned  in  1973  said  that 
they  were  better  off  than  their  parents.  In  1988  the  proportion 


153 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

fell  to  38  percent,  and  60  percent  responded  that  they  were  the 
same  or  worse  off  than  their  parents. 

In  sum,  social  polarization  persists,  but  it  is  no  longer  a  dual- 
ity. Its  boundaries  are  multiple  and  mobile,  depending  on  the 
dimension,  and  remain  poorly  denned.  There  is  a  vast  middle 
ground  that  defies  simple  analyses  and  explanations  and 
includes  the  upwardly  and  the  downwardly  mobile. 

Macroeconomic  policies  aimed  at  stabilization  and  competi- 
tive insertion  of  Brazil  into  global  markets  contribute  to  slower 
economic  growth  and  structural  unemployment,  which  in  turn 
worsen  exclusion.  At  the  same  time,  government  authorities 
have  stated  their  intention  to  give  priority  to  social  equity,  the 
reduction  of  regional  inequalities,  and  the  defense  of  human 
and  citizen  rights.  Effective  achievement  of  these  goals,  to  the 
extent  that  economic  conditions  permit,  depends  on  appropri- 
ate analysis,  political  will,  and  especially  the  ability  of  citizens  to 
make  their  demands  clear. 

It  is  unclear  whether  never-ending  economic  and  political 
crises,  disasters,  and  scandals  will  provoke  disillusionment  with 
the  redemocratization  process  and  with  Brazil's  future,  or 
whether  Brazilian  society  will  continue  to  change  in  the  direc- 
tion of  greater  equilibrium  within  society  and  between  society 
and  the  environment.  There  are  important  signs  that  signifi- 
cant change  is  underway.  The  campaign  against  hunger  and 
misery  and  for  citizens'  rights  launched  by  Herbert  "Betinho" 
de  Souza,  a  sociologist,  made  many  Brazilians  aware  of  the  pov- 
erty that  surrounds  them  and  made  clear  that  economic 
growth  or  government  benefits  alone  will  not  solve  their  prob- 
lems. The  process  of  decentralization  opened  up  opportunities 
for  participation  but  raised  questions  about  pork-barreling, 
accountability,  and  the  ability  of  local  governments  and  civil 
society  to  make  and  implement  informed  decisions.  The  ques- 
tion is  to  what  extent  the  progressive  forces  will  prevail  so  that 
even  if  inequality  persists,  it  will  not  be  attributed  to  a  failure  of 
Brazilian  society  to  respond.

anan  Wood  Carvings 


FROM  PORTUGAL'S  DISCOVERY  of  Brazil  in  1500  until  the 
late  1930s,  the  Brazilian  economy  relied  on  the  production  of 
primary  products  (see  Glossary)  for  exports.  Portugal  sub- 
jected Brazil  to  a  sternly  enforced  colonial  pact,  or  imperial 
mercantile  policy,  which  for  three  centuries  heavily  curbed 
development.  The  colonial  phase  left  strong  imprints  on  the 
country's  economy  and  society,  lasting  long  after  indepen- 
dence in  1822.  Measurable  changes  began  occurring  only  late 
in  the  eighteenth  century,  when  slavery  was  eliminated  and 
wage  labor  was  adopted.  Important  structural  transformations 
began  only  in  the  1930s,  when  the  first  steps  were  taken  to 
change  Brazil  into  a  modern,  semi-industrialized  economy. 

These  transformations  were  particularly  intense  between 
1950  and  1981,  when  the  growth  rates  of  the  economy 
remained  quite  high  and  a  diversified  manufacturing  base  was 
established.  However,  since  the  early  1980s  the  economy  has 
experienced  substantial  difficulties,  including  slow  growth  and 
stagnation.  Nevertheless,  Brazil  still  has  the  potential  to  regain 
its  former  dynamism.  In  the  mid-1990s,  it  had  a  large  and  quite 
diversified  economy,  but  one  with  considerable  structural,  as 
well  as  short-term,  problems. 

Socioeconomic  transformation  took  place  rapidly  after 
World  War  II.  In  the  1940s,  only  31.3  percent  of  Brazil's  41.2 
million  inhabitants  resided  in  towns  and  cities;  by  1991,  of  the 
country's  146.9  million  inhabitants  75.5  percent  lived  in  cities, 
and  Brazil  had  two  of  the  world's  largest  metropolitan  cen- 
ters— Sao  Paulo  and  Rio  de  Janeiro.  The  rate  of  population 
growth  decreased  from  about  3  percent  annually  in  the  1950s 
and  1960s  to  1.9  percent  annually  in  the  1980-91  period,  indi- 
cating that  Brazil  was  in  a  demographic  transition.  By  mid-1997 
Brazil  had  an  estimated  population  of  159.9  million. 

The  share  of  the  primary  sector  (see  Glossary)  in  the  gross 
national  product  (GNP — see  Glossary)  declined  from  28  per- 
cent in  1947  to  11  percent  in  1992.  Despite  this  reduction,  the 
agricultural  sector  remains  important.  Although  part  of  it  is 
primitive  and  intensive,  part  is  modern  and  dynamic.  Brazil 
remains  one  of  the  world's  largest  exporters  of  agricultural 
products. 

In  the  same  1947-92  period,  the  contribution  of  industry  to 
GNP  increased  from  less  than  20  percent  to  39  percent.  The 


159 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

industrial  sector  produces  a  wide  range  of  products  for  the 
domestic  market  and  for  export,  including  consumer  goods, 
intermediate  goods  (see  Glossary),  and  capital  goods  (see  Glos- 
sary). By  the  early  1990s,  Brazil  was  producing  about  1  million 
motor  vehicles  annually  and  about  32,000  units  of  motor- 
driven  farming  machines.  On  an  annual  basis,  it  was  also  pro- 
ducing 1.8  million  tons  of  fertilizers,  4.7  million  tons  of  card- 
board and  paper,  20  million  tons  of  steel,  26  million  tons  of 
cement,  3.5  million  television  sets,  and  3  million  refrigerators. 
In  addition,  about  70  million  cubic  meters  of  petroleum  were 
being  processed  annually  into  fuels,  lubricants,  propane  gas, 
and  a  wide  range  of  petrochemicals.  Furthermore,  Brazil  has  at 
least  161,500  kilometers  of  paved  roads  and  more  than  63  mil- 
lion megawatts  of  installed  electric  power  capacity. 

Despite  these  figures,  the  economy  cannot  be  considered 
developed.  Although  the  economic  changes  since  1947  raised 
the  country's  per  capita  income  above  US$2,000  in  1980,  per 
capita  income  in  1995  was  still  only  US$4,630.  Growth  and 
structural  change  have  not  altered  significantly  Brazil's 
extremely  unequal  distribution  of  wealth,  income,  and  oppor- 
tunity. Despite  impressive  increments  in  economic  growth  and 
output,  the  number  of  poor  has  risen  sharply.  Most  of  the  poor 
are  concentrated  in  the  rural  areas  of  Brazil's  Northeast  (Nor- 
deste)  Region,  or  in  the  country's  large  cities  or  metropolitan 
areas.  The  economic  and  political  troubles  of  the  1980s  and 
early  1990s  have  only  complicated  the  task  of  correcting  the 
country's  development  pattern. 

Historical  Background  and  Economic  Growth 

The  Colonial  Period 

Portugal's  exploitation  of  Brazil  stemmed  from  the  Euro- 
pean commercial  expansion  of  the  fifteenth  and  sixteenth  cen- 
turies (see  The  Colonial  Era,  1500-1815,  ch.  1).  Blocked  from 
the  lucrative  hinterland  trade  with  the  Far  East,  which  was 
dominated  by  Italian  cities,  Portugal  began  in  the  early  fif- 
teenth century  to  search  for  other  routes  to  the  sources  of 
goods  valued  in  European  markets.  Portugal  discovered  the 
maritime  passage  to  the  East  Indies  around  the  southern  tip  of 
Africa  and  established  a  network  of  trade  outposts  throughout 
Africa  and  Asia.  After  the  discovery  of  America,  it  competed 
with  Spain  in  occupying  the  New  World  (see  the  Indigenous 
Population,  ch.  1).

The  Economy 


Initially,  the  Portuguese  did  not  find  mineral  riches  in  their 
American  colony,  but  they  never  lost  the  hope  of  someday  find- 
ing such  riches  there.  Meanwhile,  in  order  to  settle  and  defend 
the  colony  from  European  intruders,  the  Portuguese  estab- 
lished a  pioneer  colonial  enterprise:  the  production  of  sugar  in 
the  Northeast.  Beginning  in  about  1531,  cattle  began  arriving 
in  Brazil,  and  a  cattle  industry  developed  rapidly  in  response  to 
the  needs  of  the  sugar  industry  for  transportation  and  food  for 
workers.  The  discovery  of  precious  metals  in  the  colony's  Cen- 
ter-South (Centro-Sul),  a  relatively  undefined  region  encom- 
passing the  present-day  Southeast  (Sudeste)  and  South  (Sul) 
regions,  came  only  in  the  eighteenth  century. 

The  Sugar  Cycle,  1540-1640 

By  the  mid-sixteenth  century,  Portugal  had  succeeded  in 
establishing  a  sugar  economy  in  parts  of  the  colony's  northeast- 
ern coast.  Sugar  production,  the  first  large-scale  colonial  agri- 
cultural enterprise,  was  made  possible  by  a  series  of  favorable 
conditions.  Portugal  had  the  agricultural  and  manufacturing 
know-how  from  its  Atlantic  islands  and  manufactured  its  own 
equipment  for  extracting  sugar  from  sugarcane.  Furthermore, 
being  involved  in  the  African  slave  trade,  it  had  access  to  the 
necessary  manpower.  Finally,  Portugal  relied  on  the  commer- 
cial skills  of  the  Dutch  and  financing  from  Holland  to  enable  a 
rapid  penetration  of  sugar  in  Europe's  markets. 

Until  the  early  seventeenth  century,  the  Portuguese  and  the 
Dutch  held  a  virtual  monopoly  on  sugar  exports  to  Europe. 
However,  between  1580  and  1640  Portugal  was  incorporated 
into  Spain,  a  country  at  war  with  Holland.  The  Dutch  occupied 
Brazil's  sugar  area  in  the  Northeast  from  1630  to  1654,  estab- 
lishing direct  control  of  the  world's  sugar  supply.  When  the 
Dutch  were  driven  out  in  1654,  they  had  acquired  the  technical 
and  organizational  know-how  for  sugar  production.  Their 
involvement  in  the  expansion  of  sugar  in  the  Caribbean  con- 
tributed to  the  downfall  of  the  Portuguese  monopoly. 

The  Caribbean  sugar  boom  brought  about  a  steady  decline 
in  world  sugar  prices.  Unable  to  compete,  Brazilian  sugar 
exports,  which  had  peaked  by  the  mid-seventeenth  century, 
declined  sharply.  Between  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  seven- 
teenth century  and  the  early  eighteenth  century,  Portugal  had 
difficulties  in  maintaining  its  American  colony.  The  downfall  of 
sugar  revealed  a  fragile  colonial  economy,  which  had  no  com- 
modity to  replace  sugar.  Paradoxically,  however,  the  period  of 


161 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

stagnation  induced  the  settlement  of  substantial  portions  of 
the  colony's  territory.  With  the  decline  of  sugar,  the  cattle  sec- 
tor, which  had  evolved  to  supply  the  sugar  economy  with  ani- 
mals for  transport,  meat,  and  hides,  assimilated  part  of  the 
resources  made  idle,  becoming  a  subsistence  economy. 
Because  of  extensive  cattle  production  methods,  large  areas  in 
the  colony's  interior  were  settled. 

Realizing  that  it  could  maintain  Brazil  only  if  precious  min- 
erals were  discovered,  Portugal  increased  its  exploratory  efforts 
in  the  late  seventeenth  century.  As  a  result,  early  in  the  eigh- 
teenth century  gold  and  other  precious  minerals  were  found. 
The  largest  concentration  of  this  gold  was  in  the  Southeastern 
Highlands,  mainly  in  what  is  now  Minas  Gerais  State. 

The  Eighteenth-Century  Gold  Rush 

As  a  result  of  the  mineral  discoveries,  settlers  flocked  to  the 
gold  region,  and  growing  numbers  of  slaves  were  transferred 
from  the  sugar  areas  and  brought  in  from  Africa.  Gold  mining 
was  mainly  alluvial  panning,  a  labor-intensive  activity.  The 
extraction  of  gold  increased  rapidly  until  the  1750s  when  gold 
exports  peaked.  After  the  gold  deposits  became  depleted  and 
exports  declined  sharply  in  the  last  quarter  of  the  eighteenth 
century,  the  Brazilian  economy  entered  another  long  period  of 
stagnation. 

The  gold  surge  did  not  establish  a  basis  for  economic  expan- 
sion after  the  depletion  of  the  mines.  The  economic  regression 
was  especially  bad  because  of  the  restrictions  Portugal  had 
imposed  on  the  establishment  of  manufacturing  in  the  colony. 
However,  the  gold  rush  had  an  important  impact  in  shaping 
Brazil's  territory.  First,  the  various  exploratory  expeditions  led 
to  the  incorporation  of  large  areas  originally  belonging  to 
Spain.  In  addition,  the  demand  for  food  and  animals  for  trans- 
portation and  meat  had  major  repercussions  outside  the  min- 
ing region.  The  mines  were  located  in  inhospitable, 
mountainous  terrain,  and  the  movement  of  goods  to  and  from 
the  mines  depended  heavily  on  mules.  Agricultural  activities 
were  expanded  elsewhere  in  order  to  feed  the  miners.  Thus, 
the  gold  rush  brought  about  the  occupation  of,  and  interaction 
among,  different  geographical  areas.  Moreover,  the  colony's 
economic  and  administrative  center  of  gravity  moved  to  the 
Southeast  Region.  Gold  was  shipped  through  ports  in  or  near 
Rio  de  Janeiro,  prompting  the  transfer  of  the  colonial  adminis- 
tration from  the  Bahian  town  of  Salvador  to  Rio  de  Janeiro. 


162 


The  Economy 


The  difficult  period  resulting  from  the  depletion  of  the 
mines  lasted  well  into  the  second  quarter  of  the  nineteenth 
century.  The  mainstays  of  the  economy  were  in  decline,  and 
the  colony  fell  into  a  state  of  depression  and  decadence.  In  the 
late  eighteenth  century,  Brazil  experienced  a  brief  surge  in  cot- 
ton exports  to  Britain,  as  the  War  of  Independence  in  America 
disrupted  American  trade  temporarily;  however,  Brazilian  cot- 
ton lost  its  place  in  the  world  market  by  the  early  nineteenth 
century. 

The  Economy  at  Independence,  1822 

Despite  Brazil's  economic  troubles,  the  early  nineteenth  cen- 
tury was  a  period  of  change.  First,  the  Napoleonic  Wars  forced 
the  Portuguese  royal  family  to  flee  to  Brazil  in  1808,  and  for  a 
short  period  the  colony  became  the  seat  of  the  Portuguese 
empire  (see  The  Kingdom  of  Portugal  and  Brazil,  1808-21,  ch. 
1).  Moreover,  in  1808  Britain  persuaded  Portugal  to  open  the 
colony  to  trade  with  the  rest  of  the  world,  and  Portugal 
rescinded  its  prohibition  against  manufacturing.  These  events 
paved  the  way  for  Brazil's  independence  on  September  7,  1822. 

Brazil's  early  years  as  an  independent  nation  were  extremely 
difficult.  Exports  remained  low,  and  the  domestic  economy  was 
depressed.  The  only  segment  that  expanded  was  the  subsis- 
tence economy.  Resources  (land,  slaves,  and  transport  animals) 
made  idle  by  the  decline  of  the  export  economy  were  absorbed 
into  mostly  self-consumption  activities. 

The  Coffee  Economy,  1840-1930 

The  impact  of  coffee  on  the  Brazilian  economy  was  much 
stronger  than  that  of  sugar  and  gold.  When  the  coffee  surge 
began,  Brazil  was  already  free  from  the  limitations  of  colonial- 
ism. Moreover,  the  substitution  of  wage  labor  for  slave  labor 
after  1870  meant  an  increase  in  efficiency  and  the  formation  of 
a  domestic  market  for  wage  goods.  Finally,  the  greater  com- 
plexity of  coffee  production  and  trade  established  important 
sectorial  linkages  within  the  Brazilian  economy. 

Coffee  was  introduced  in  Brazil  early  in  the  eighteenth  cen- 
tury, but  initially  it  was  planted  only  for  domestic  use.  It  took 
the  high  world  prices  of  the  late  1820s  and  early  1830s  to  turn 
coffee  into  a  major  export  item.  During  the  initial  phase,  pro- 
duction was  concentrated  in  the  mountainous  region  near  Rio 
de  Janeiro.  This  area  was  highly  suitable  for  coffee  cultivation, 
and  it  had  access  to  fairly  abundant  slave  labor.  Moreover,  the 


163 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

coffee  could  be  transported  easily  on  mule  trains  or  on  animal- 
drawn  carts  over  short  distances  to  the  ports. 

An  entrepreneurial  class  established  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  dur- 
ing the  mining  surge  was  able  to  induce  the  government  to 
help  create  basic  conditions  for  the  expansion  of  coffee,  such 
as  removing  transportation  and  labor  bottlenecks.  From  the 
area  near  Rio  de  Janeiro,  coffee  production  moved  along  the 
Paraiba  Valley  toward  Sao  Paulo  State,  which  later  became  Bra- 
zil's largest  exporting  region.  Coffee  was  cultivated  with  primi- 
tive techniques  and  with  no  regard  to  land  conservation.  Land 
was  abundant,  and  production  could  expand  easily  through 
the  incorporation  of  new  areas.  However,  it  soon  became  nec- 
essary to  ease  two  basic  constraints:  the  lack  of  transportation 
and  the  shortage  of  labor. 

The  cultivation  of  coffee  farther  away  from  ports  required 
the  construction  of  railroads,  first  around  Rio  de  Janeiro  and 
into  the  Paraiba  Valley,  and  later  into  the  fertile  highlands  of 
Sao  Paulo.  In  1860  Brazil  had  only  223  kilometers  of  railroads; 
by  1885  this  total  had  increased  to  6,930  kilometers.  The  main 
rail  link  between  Sao  Paulo's  eastern  highlands  and  the  ocean 
port  of  Santos  allowed  for  a  rapid  expansion  of  coffee  into  the 
center  and  northwest  of  the  state. 

After  the  initial  coffee  expansion,  the  availability  of  slaves 
dwindled,  and  further  cultivation  required  additional  slaves. 
However,  by  1840  Brazil  was  already  under  pressure  to  abolish 
slavery,  and  a  series  of  decrees  were  introduced,  making  it 
increasingly  difficult  to  supply  the  new  coffee  areas  with  servile 
labor.  In  the  1870s,  the  shortage  of  labor  became  critical,  lead- 
ing to  the  gradual  incorporation  of  free  immigrant  labor.  The 
coffee  expansion  in  the  west-northwest  of  Sao  Paulo  State  after 
1880  was  made  possible  largely  by  immigrant  labor.  In  1880  Sao 
Paulo  produced  1.2  million  60-kilogram  coffee  bags,  or  25  per- 
cent of  Brazil's  total;  by  1888  this  proportion  had  jumped  to  40 
percent  (2.6  million  bags);  and  by  1902,  to  60  percent  (8  mil- 
lion bags).  In  turn,  between  1884  and  1890  some  201,000 
immigrants  had  entered  Sao  Paulo  State,  and  this  total  jumped 
to  more  than  733,000  between  1891  and  1900.  Slavery  was  abol- 
ished in  1888. 

The  Brazilian  economy  grew  considerably  in  the  second  half 
of  the  nineteenth  century.  Coffee  was  the  mainstay  of  the  econ- 
omy, accounting  for  63  percent  of  the  country's  exports  in 
1891.  However,  sugar,  cotton,  tobacco,  cocoa,  and,  at  the  turn 
of  the  century,  rubber  were  also  important.  During  the  first

three  decades  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  Brazilian  economy 
went  through  periods  of  growth  but  also  difficulties  caused  in 
part  by  World  War  I,  the  Great  Depression,  and  an  increasing 
trend  toward  coffee  overproduction.  The  four-year  gap 
between  the  time  a  coffee  tree  is  planted  and  the  time  of  the 
first  harvest  magnified  cyclical  fluctuations  in  coffee  prices, 
which  in  turn  led  to  the  increasing  use  of  government  price 
supports  during  periods  of  excess  production.  The  price  sup- 
ports induced  an  exaggerated  expansion  of  coffee  cultivation 
in  Sao  Paulo,  culminating  in  the  huge  overproduction  of  the 
early  1930s. 

The  1840  to  1930  period  also  saw  an  appreciable  but  irregu- 
lar expansion  of  light  industries,  notably  textiles,  clothing,  food 
products,  beverages,  and  tobacco.  This  expansion  was  induced 
by  the  growth  in  income,  by  the  availability  of  foreign 
exchange,  by  fiscal  policies,  and  by  external  events,  such  as 
World  War  I.  Other  important  factors  were  the  expansion  of 
transportation,  the  installed  capacity  of  electric  energy, 
increased  urbanization,  and  the  formation  of  a  dynamic  entre- 
preneurial class.  However,  the  manufacturing  growth  of  the 
period  did  not  generate  significant  structural  transformations. 

Economic  growth  in  the  nineteenth  century  was  not  shared 
equally  by  the  regions.  Development  and  growth  were  concen- 
trated in  the  Southeast.  The  South  Region  also  achieved  con- 
siderable development  based  on  coffee  and  other  agricultural 
products.  The  Amazon  Basin  experienced  a  meteoric  rise  and 
fall  of  incomes  from  rubber  exports.  The  Northeast  continued 
to  stagnate,  with  its  population  living  close  to  the  subsistence 
level. 

A  Period  of  Sweeping  Change,  1 930-45 

The  decade  of  the  1930s  was  a  period  of  interrelated  politi- 
cal and  economic  changes.  The  decade  started  with  the  1930 
revolution,  which  abolished  the  Old  Republic  (1889-1930),  a 
federation  of  semiautonomous  states.  After  a  transitional 
period  in  which  centralizing  elements  struggled  with  the  old 
oligarchies  for  control,  a  coup  in  1937  established  the  New 
State  (Estado  Novo)  dictatorship  (1937-45)  (see  The  Era  of 
Getulio  Vargas,  1930-54,  ch.  1). 

To  a  large  extent,  the  revolution  of  1930  reflected  a  dissatis- 
faction with  the  political  control  exercised  by  the  old  oligar- 
chies. The  political  unrest  of  the  first  half  of  the  1930s  and  the 
1937  coup  were  influenced  strongly  by  the  onset  of  economic 


166 


The  Economy 


problems  in  1930.  The  coffee  economy  suffered  from  a  severe 
decline  in  world  demand  caused  by  the  Great  Depression  and 
an  excess  capacity  of  coffee  production  created  in  the  1920s.  As 
a  result,  the  price  of  coffee  fell  sharply  and  remained  at  very 
low  levels.  Brazil's  terms  of  trade  (see  Glossary)  deteriorated 
significantly.  These  events,  and  a  large  foreign  debt,  led  to  an 
external  crisis  that  took  almost  a  decade  to  resolve. 

The  external  difficulties  had  far-reaching  consequences. 
The  government  was  forced  to  suspend  part  of  the  country's 
debt  payments  and  eventually  to  impose  exchange  controls. 
Excess  coffee  production  led  to  increasing  interventions  in  the 
coffee  market.  The  state  programs  to  support  coffee  prices 
went  bankrupt  in  1930.  To  avoid  further  decreases  in  coffee 
prices,  the  central  government  bought  huge  amounts  of  cof- 
fee, which  was  then  destroyed.  Central  government  interven- 
tion provided  support  to  the  coffee  sector  and,  through  its 
linkages,  to  the  rest  of  the  economy. 

Despite  the  economic  difficulties,  the  income  maintenance 
scheme  of  the  coffee  support  program,  coupled  with  the 
implicit  protection  provided  by  the  external  crisis,  was  respon- 
sible for  greater  industrial  growth.  Initially,  this  growth  was 
based  on  increased  utilization  of  the  productive  capacity  and 
later  on  moderate  spurts  of  investment.  The  initial  import-sub- 
stitution industrialization  (see  Glossary)  that  occurred  espe- 
cially during  World  War  I  did  not  lead  to  industrialization;  it 
became  a  process  of  industrialization  only  in  the  1930s. 

The  1930s  also  saw  a  change  in  the  role  of  government. 
Until  then,  the  state  acted  primarily  in  response  to  the 
demands  of  the  export  sector.  During  the  first  half  of  the 
decade,  it  was  forced  to  interfere  swiftly  in  an  attempt  to  con- 
trol the  external  crisis  and  to  avoid  the  collapse  of  the  coffee 
economy;  government  leaders  hoped  that  the  crisis  would  pass 
soon  and  that  another  export  boom  would  occur.  However, 
with  the  magnitude  and  duration  of  the  crisis  it  became  clear 
that  Brazil  could  no  longer  rely  solely  on  exports  of  primary 
goods  (see  Glossary)  and  that  it  was  necessary  to  promote  eco- 
nomic diversification.  During  the  Estado  Novo,  the  govern- 
ment made  initial  attempts  at  economic  planning,  and  in  the 
late  1930s  began  to  establish  the  first  large  government  enter- 
prise, an  integrated  steel  mill. 

The  World  War  II  period  saw  mixed  achievements.  By  the 
late  1930s,  coffee  production  capacity  had  been  reduced  drasti- 
cally, the  worst  of  the  external  crisis  had  passed,  and  the  Brazil- 


167 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

ian  economy  was  ready  to  grow.  However,  the  war  interfered 
with  development  efforts.  Output  increased  mainly  through 
better  utilization  of  the  existing  capacity  but,  except  for  the 
steel  mill,  there  was  little  industrial  and  infrastructure  invest- 
ment. Thus,  at  the  end  of  the  war  Brazil's  industrial  capacity 
was  obsolete  and  the  transportation  infrastructure  was  inade- 
quate and  badly  deteriorated. 

Import-Substitution  Industrialization,  1945-64 

A  review  of  the  evolution  and  structural  changes  of  the 
industrial  sector  since  the  end  of  World  War  II  reveals  four 
broad  periods.  The  postwar  period  to  1962  was  a  phase  of 
intense  import  substitution,  especially  of  consumer  goods,  with 
basic  industries  growing  at  significant  but  lower  rates.  The  1968 
to  1973  period  was  one  of  very  rapid  industrial  expansion  and 
modernization  (between  1962  and  1967,  the  industrial  sector 
stagnated  as  a  result  of  adverse  macroeconomic  conditions). 
The  1974  to  1985  phase  was  highlighted  by  import  substitution 
of  basic  inputs  and  capital  goods  and  by  the  expansion  of  man- 
ufactured goods  exports.  The  period  since  1987  has  been  a 
time  of  considerable  difficulties. 

At  the  end  of  World  War  II,  political  and  economic  liberal- 
ism were  reintroduced  in  Brazil.  Getulio  Dorneles  Vargas  (pres- 
ident, 1930-45,  1951-54)  was  overthrown,  democratic  rule  was 
reestablished,  and  the  foreign-exchange  reserves  accumulated 
during  the  war  made  possible  a  reduction  of  trade  restrictions. 
However,  trade  liberalization  was  short-lived.  The  overvalued 
foreign-exchange  rate,  established  in  1945,  remained  fixed 
until  1953.  This,  combined  with  persistent  inflation  and  a 
repressed  demand,  meant  sharp  increases  in  imports  and  a 
sluggish  performance  of  exports,  which  soon  led  again  to  a  bal- 
ance of  payments  (see  Glossary)  crisis. 

Pessimistic  about  the  future  of  Brazil's  exports,  the  govern- 
ment feared  that  the  crisis  would  have  a  negative  impact  on 
inflation.  Consequently,  instead  of  devaluing  the  cruzeiro  (for 
value  of  cruzeiro — see  Glossary),  it  decided  to  deal  with  the  cri- 
sis through  exchange  controls.  In  1951  the  newly  elected  gov- 
ernment of  Getulio  Vargas  enforced  a  recently  established 
system  of  import  licensing,  giving  priority  to  imports  of  essen- 
tial goods  and  inputs  (fuels  and  machinery)  and  discouraging 
imports  of  consumer  goods.  These  policies  had  the  unantici- 
pated effect  of  providing  protection  to  the  consumer  goods 
industry.  Early  in  the  1950s,  however,  convinced  that  the  only

hope  for  rapid  growth  was  to  change  the  structure  of  the  Bra- 
zilian economy,  the  government  adopted  an  explicit  policy  of 
import-substitution  industrialization.  An  important  instrument 
of  this  policy  was  the  use  of  foreign-exchange  controls  to  pro- 
tect selected  segments  of  domestic  industry  and  to  facilitate  the 
importation  of  equipment  and  inputs  for  them. 

However,  the  move  to  fixed  exchange  rates  together  with 
import  licensing  drastically  curtailed  exports,  and  the  balance 
of  payments  problem  became  acute.  The  system  became  nearly 
unmanageable,  and  in  1953  a  more  flexible,  multiple- 
exchange-rate  system  was  introduced.  Under  the  latter,  imports 
considered  essential  were  brought  in  at  a  favored  rate;  imports 
of  goods  that  could  be  supplied  domestically  faced  high  rates 
and  were  allotted  small  portions  of  the  available  foreign 
exchange.  Similarly,  some  exports  were  stimulated  with  a 
higher  exchange  rate  than  those  of  traditional  exports.  This 
system  continued  to  be  the  main  instrument  for  the  promotion 
of  import-substitution  industrialization,  but  the  performance 
of  the  export  sector  improved  only  modestly. 

Between  1957  and  1961,  the  government  made  several 
changes  in  the  exchange-control  system,  most  of  which  were 
attempts  at  reducing  its  awkwardness  or  at  improving  its  perfor- 
mance with  the  advance  of  import-substitution  industrializa-

tion.  For  this  same  purpose,  the  government  also  introduced 
several  complementary  measures,  including  enacting  the  Tariff 
Law  of  1957,  increasing  and  solidifying  the  protection 
extended  to  domestic  industries,  and  offering  strong  induce- 
ments to  direct  foreign  investment. 

In  the  second  half  of  the  1950s,  the  government  enacted  a 
series  of  special  programs  intended  to  better  orient  the  indus- 
trialization process,  to  remove  bottlenecks,  and  to  promote  ver- 
tical integration  (see  Glossary)  in  certain  industries.  The 
government  gave  special  attention  to  industries  considered 
basic  for  growth,  notably  the  automotive,  cement,  steel,  alumi- 
num, cellulose,  heavy  machinery,  and  chemical  industries. 

As  a  result  of  import-substitution  industrialization,  the  Bra- 
zilian economy  experienced  rapid  growth  and  considerable 
diversification.  Between  1950  and  1961,  the  average  annual 
rate  of  growth  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — see  Glos- 
sary) exceeded  7  percent  (see  table  4,  Appendix).  Industry  was 
the  engine  of  growth.  It  had  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of 
over  9  percent  between  1950  and  1961,  compared  with  4.5  per- 
cent for  agriculture.  In  addition,  the  structure  of  the  manufac- 
turing sector  experienced  considerable  change.  Traditional 
industries,  such  as  textiles,  food  products,  and  clothing, 
declined,  while  the  transport  equipment,  machinery,  electric 
equipment  and  appliances,  and  chemical  industries  expanded. 

However,  the  strategy  also  left  a  legaq^  of  problems  and  dis- 
tortions. The  growth  it  promoted  resulted  in  a  substantial 
increase  in  imports,  notably  of  inputs  and  machinery,  and  the 
foreign-exchange  policies  of  the  period  meant  inadequate 
export  growth.  Moreover,  a  large  influx  of  foreign  capital  in 
the  1950s  resulted  in  a  large  foreign  debt. 

Import-substitution  industrialization  can  be  assessed  accord- 
ing to  the  contribution  to  value  added  by  four  main  industrial 
subsectors:  nondurable  consumer  goods,  durable  consumer 
goods,  intermediate  goods,  and  capital  goods.  Using  data  from 
the  industrial  censuses,  the  share  of  these  groups  in  value 
added  between  1949  and  1960  shows  a  considerable  decline  in 
the  share  of  the  nondurable  goods  industries,  from  nearly  60 
percent  to  less  than  43  percent,  and  a  sharp  increase  in  that  of 
durable  goods,  from  nearly  6  percent  to  more  than  18  percent. 
The  intermediate  and  capital  goods  groups  experienced  mod- 
erate increases,  from  32  to  36  percent  and  from  2.2  to  3.2  per- 
cent, respectively. 


170 


The  Economy 


A  representative  component  of  the  nondurable  group  is  the 
textile  industry,  the  leading  sector  before  World  War  II. 
Between  1949  and  1960,  its  share  in  the  value  added  by  indus- 
try as  a  whole  experienced  a  sharp  decline,  from  20.1  percent 
to  11.6  percent.  In  the  durable  goods  group,  the  component 
with  the  most  significant  change  was  the  transport  equipment 
sector  (automobiles  and  trucks),  which  increased  from  2.3  per- 
cent to  10.5  percent. 

The  lower  increases  in  the  shares  of  the  intermediate  and 
capital  goods  industries  reflect  the  lesser  priority  attributed  to 
them  by  the  import-substitution  industrialization  strategy.  In 
the  early  1960s,  Brazil  already  had  a  fairly  diversified  industrial 
structure,  but  one  in  which  vertical  integration  was  only  begin- 
ning. Thus,  instead  of  alleviating  the  balance  of  payments 
problems,  import  substitution  increased  them  dramatically. 

Stagnation  and  Spectacular  Growth,  1962-80 

Stagnation,  1962-67 

As  a  result  of  the  problems  associated  with  import-substitu- 
tion industrialization  and  the  reforms  introduced  by  the  mili- 
tary regime  after  March  1964,  the  Brazilian  economy  lost  much 
of  its  dynamism  between  1962  and  1967.  The  average  rate  of 
growth  of  GDP  in  the  period  declined  to  4.0  percent  and  that 
of  industry  to  3.9  percent.  In  part,  stagnation  resulted  from  dis- 
tortions caused  by  the  strategy.  Moreover,  political  troubles 
negatively  affected  expectations  and  precluded  the  formation 
of  a  coalition  to  back  the  introduction  of  tough  measures  to 
control  inflation  and  the  balance  of  payments  crisis.  Political 
troubles  also  hindered  the  removal  of  obstacles  to  growth. 

The  1964  coup  dealt  with  the  political  obstacles  by  forcefully 
restraining  opposition  to  the  military  agenda  of  change.  With 
the  objective  of  transforming  Brazil  into  a  modern  capitalist 
economy  and  a  military  power,  the  regime  implemented  a 
series  of  reforms  aimed  at  reducing  inflation,  at  removing 
some  of  the  distortions  of  import-substitution  industrialization, 
and  at  modernizing  capital  markets.  The  regime  gradually 
introduced  incentives  to  direct  investment,  domestic  and  for- 
eign, and  tackled  balance  of  payments  problems  by  reforming 
and  simplifying  the  foreign-exchange  system.  In  addition,  the 
regime  introduced  a  mechanism  of  periodic  devaluations  of 
the  cruzeiro,  taking  into  account  inflation.  Finally,  the  military 
government  adopted  measures  to  attract  foreign  capital  and  to 


171 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

promote  exports.  It  took  steps  to  expand  public  investment  to 
improve  the  country's  infrastructure  and  later  to  develop  state- 
owned  basic  industries. 

Spectacular  Growth,  1968-73 

The  post-1964  reforms  and  other  policies  of  the  military  gov- 
ernment, together  with  the  state  of  the  world  economy,  created 
conditions  for  very  rapid  growth  between  1968  and  1973.  In 
that  period,  the  average  annual  rate  of  growth  of  GDP  jumped 
to  11.1  percent,  led  by  industry  with  a  13.1  percent  average. 
Within  industry,  the  leading  sectors  were  consumer  durables 
(see  Glossary),  transportation  equipment,  and  basic  industries, 
such  as  steel,  cement,  and  electricity  generation. 

As  a  result  of  the  post-1964  policies,  external  trade 
expanded  substantially  faster  than  the  economy  as  a  whole. 
There  was  a  significant  growth  in  exports,  especially  manufac- 
tured goods,  but  also  commodities.  Yet,  imports  grew  consider- 
ably faster,  rapidly  increasing  the  trade  deficit.  This  did  not 
present  a  problem,  however,  because  massive  inflows  of  capital 
resulted  in  balance  of  payments  surpluses. 

The  external  sector  contributed  substantially  to  high  growth 
rates,  as  did  the  rapid  expansion  of  investment,  including  a 
growing  share  of  public  investment  and  investment  by  state- 
controlled  enterprises.  In  addition,  increased  demand  for  auto- 
mobiles, durable  and  luxury  goods,  and  housing  resulted  from 
a  rapid  growth  in  income  for  the  upper  income  strata  and  from 
credit  plans  created  for  consumers  and  homebuyers  by  the  cap- 
ital-market reforms. 

The  industrial  sector  generally  experienced  not  only  rapid 
growth  but  also  considerable  modernization.  As  a  result, 
imports  of  capital  goods  and  basic  and  semiprocessed  inputs 
increased  sharply.  The  share  of  intermediate  goods  imports  in 
total  imports  increased  from  31.0  percent  in  the  1960-62 
period  to  42.7  percent  in  1972,  and  that  of  capital  goods,  from 
29.0  to  42.2  percent.  The  total  value  of  imports  rose  from 
US$1.3  billion  to  US$4.4  billion. 

A  comparison  of  the  1960  and  the  1975  shares  of  the  various 
industrial  sectors  in  total  value  added  by  industry  reveals  a  con- 
tinuation in  the  relative  decline  of  nondurable  industries,  nota- 
bly textiles,  food  products,  and  beverages,  and  an  increase  in 
machinery,  from  3.2  to  10.3  percent.  The  relative  shares  of 
most  of  the  remaining  industries,  however,  did  not  change  sig- 
nificantly in  the  period. 


172 


The  Economy 


As  a  result  of  the  period's  outward-looking  development 
strategy,  Brazil's  industrial  exports  increased  from  US$1.4  bil- 
lion in  1963  to  US$6.2  billion  in  1973.  The  composition  of 
exports  shows  that  whereas  in  1963  processed  and  semipro- 
cessed  manufactured  exports  accounted  for  only  5  percent  of 
total  exports,  in  1974  their  share  had  reached  29  percent. 

In  the  1968-73  period,  personal  income  became  more  con- 
centrated and  regional  disparities  became  greater.  Industrial 
expansion  took  place  more  vigorously  in  the  Center-South 
Region,  which  had  benefited  most  from  the  import-substitu- 
tion industrialization  strategy.  Its  per  capita  income  consider- 
ably exceeded  the  national  average,  its  infrastructure  was  more 
developed,  and  it  had  an  adequate  supply  of  skilled  workers 
and  professionals.  The  region  was  therefore  able  to  take  advan- 
tage of  the  opportunities  and  incentives  offered  by  the  military 
regime.  Although  a  special  regional  development  strategy 
existed  for  the  Northeast,  it  promoted  a  distorted  industrializa- 
tion that  benefited  only  a  few  of  that  region's  large  cities;  the 
Northeast's  linkages  with  the  Center-South  were  stronger  than 
its  linkages  within  the  region.  The  combination  of  a  harsh  cli- 
mate, a  highly  concentrated  land-tenure  system,  and  an  elite 
that  consistently  resisted  meaningful  change  prevented  the 
Northeast  from  developing  effectively. 

Growth  with  Debt,  1974-80 

Brazil  suffered  drastic  reductions  in  its  terms  of  trade  as  a 
result  of  the  1973  oil  shock.  In  the  early  1970s,  the  perfor- 
mance of  the  export  sector  was  undermined  by  an  overvalued 
currency.  With  the  trade  balance  under  pressure,  the  oil  shock 
led  to  a  sharply  higher  import  bill.  Under  such  circumstances, 
a  prudent  course  of  action  would  have  been  to  devalue  the 
cruzeiro  and  to  adopt  growth-reducing  policies  in  order  to  con- 
tain imports.  However,  Brazil  opted  to  continue  a  high-growth 
policy.  Furthermore,  it  adopted  renewed  strategies  of  import- 
substitution  industrialization  and  of  economic  diversification. 
In  the  mid-1970s,  the  regime  began  implementing  a  develop- 
ment plan  aimed  at  increasing  self-sufficiency  in  many  sectors 
and  creating  new  comparative  advantages  (see  Glossary).  Its 
main  components  were  to  promote  import  substitution  of  basic 
industrial  inputs  (steel,  aluminum,  fertilizers,  petrochemicals), 
to  make  large  investments  in  the  expansion  of  the  economic 
infrastructure,  and  to  promote  exports. 


173 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

This  strategy  was  effective  in  promoting  growth,  but  it  also 
raised  Brazil's  import  requirements  markedly,  increasing  the 
already  large  current-account  deficit.  The  current  account  (see 
Glossary)  was  financed  by  running  up  the  foreign  debt.  The 
expectation  was  that  the  combined  effects  of  import-substitu- 
tion industrialization  and  export  expansion  eventually  would 
bring  about  growing  trade  surpluses,  allowing  the  service  and 
repayment  of  the  foreign  debt. 

Thus,  despite  the  world  recession  resulting  from  other  coun- 
tries' adjustments  to  the  oil  shock,  Brazil  was  able  to  maintain  a 
high  growth  rate.  Between  1974  and  1980,  the  average  annual 
rate  of  growth  of  real  GDP  reached  6.9  percent  and  that  of 
industry,  7.2  percent.  However,  the  current-account  deficit 
increased  from  US$1.7  billion  in  1973  to  US$12.8  billion  in 
1980  (see  table  5,  Appendix).  The  foreign  debt  rose  from 
US$6.4  billion  in  1963  to  nearly  US$54  billion  in  1980. 

Brazil  was  able  to  raise  its  foreign  debt  because,  at  the  time, 
the  international  financial  system  was  awash  in  petrodollars 
and  was  eagerly  offering  low-interest  loans.  By  the  end  of  the 
1970s,  however,  the  foreign  debt  had  reached  high  levels.  Addi- 
tionally, the  marked  increase  of  international  interest  rates 
raised  the  debt  service  (see  Glossary),  forcing  the  country  to 
borrow  more  only  to  meet  interest  payments  (see  table  6, 
Appendix).  Productive  capacity,  exports,  and  the  substitution 
of  imports  in  various  sectors  expanded  and  became  more  diver- 
sified. However,  the  expected  impacts  on  Brazil's  current 
account  were  not  to  materialize  until  the  mid-1980s. 

Another  feature  of  the  1974—80  period  was  an  acceleration 
of  inflation.  Between  1968  and  1974,  the  rate  of  inflation  had 
declined  steadily,  but  afterward  the  trend  was  reversed.  From 
16.2  percent  a  year  in  1973,  the  growth  rate  of  the  general 
price  index  (GPI — see  Glossary)  increased  to  110.2  percent  a 
year  by  1980. 

Stagnation,  Inflation,  and  Crisis,  1981-94 

The  effect  of  the  1974-85  period's  industrialization  on  the 
balance  of  trade  was  significant.  The  balance  of  trade  moved 
from  an  average  deficit  of  US$3.4  billion  in  the  1974-76  period 
to  an  average  surplus  of  US$10.7  billion  in  the  1983-85  period. 
In  1985  the  share  of  manufactures  (processed  and  semipro- 
cessed)  of  total  exports  reached  66  percent,  and  between 
1971-75  and  1978-83  the  share  of  basic  input  imports  in  total 
imports  declined  from  32.3  percent  to  19.2  percent.  The  reces-

sion  and  stagnation  of  the  early  1980s  had  a  role  in  reducing 
imports.  However,  import  substitution  was  also  important,  as 
demonstrated  by  the  few  years  of  the  1980s  that  experienced  a 
significant  growth  in  GDP  while  the  trade  surplus  was  main- 
tained. 

Between  1981  and  1992,  the  GDP  increased  at  an  average 
annual  rate  of  only  1.4  percent  and  per  capita  income  declined 
6  percent.  Gross  investment,  as  a  proportion  of  GDP,  fell  from 
21  to  16  percent,  in  part  as  a  result  of  the  fiscal  crisis  and  the 
loss  of  public-sector  investment  capacity.  The  decline  also 
reflected  growing  uncertainties  regarding  the  future  of  the 
economy.  The  1980s  became  known  as  the  "lost  decade,"  and 
its  problems  spilled  over  into  the  1990s.  Despite  the  stagnation 
of  the  1981-92  period,  inflation  remained  a  major  problem.  It 
sometimes  reached  very  high  rates,  prompting  the  implemen- 
tation of  short-lived  shock-stabilization  programs. 

The  1981-84  Period 

In  1979  a  second  oil  shock  nearly  doubled  the  price  of 
imported  oil  to  Brazil  and  lowered  the  terms  of  trade  further. 


175 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

The  rise  in  world  interest  rates  increased  sharply  Brazil's  bal- 
ance of  payments  problem  and  the  size  of  the  foreign  debt. 
Nevertheless,  the  government  continued  borrowing,  mainly  to 
face  an  increasing  debt  burden,  while  it  tried  vainly  to  maintain 
the  high-growth  strategy.  At  the  beginning  of  the  1980s,  how- 
ever, the  foreign-debt  problem  became  acute,  leading  to  the 
introduction  of  a  program  to  generate  growing  trade  surpluses 
in  order  to  service  the  foreign  debt.  The  program  was  achieved 
by  reducing  growth  and,  with  it,  imports,  and  by  expanding 
exports.  As  a  result,  in  1981  real  GDP  declined  by  4.4  percent. 
The  1982  Mexican  debt  crisis  ended  Brazil's  access  to  interna- 
tional financial  markets,  increasing  the  pressure  for  economic 
adjustment. 

The  austerity  program  imposed  by  the  International  Mone- 
tary Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary)  in  late  1979  continued  until 
1984,  but  substantial  trade  surpluses  were  obtained  only  from 
1983  on,  largely  as  a  delayed  result  of  the  import-substitution 
industrialization  programs  of  the  1970s  and  the  reduction  in 
imports  brought  about  by  economic  decline.  The  austerity  pro- 
gram enabled  Brazil  to  meet  interest  payments  on  the  debt,  but 
at  the  price  of  economic  decline  and  increasing  inflation. 

Inflation  accelerated  as  a  result  of  a  combination  of  factors: 
the  exchange-rate  devaluations  of  the  austerity  program,  a 
growing  public  deficit,  and  an  increasing  indexation  (see  Glos- 
sary) of  financial  balances,  wages,  and  other  values  for  infla- 
tion. The  first  two  factors  are  classical  causes  of  inflation;  the 
last  became  an  important  mechanism  for  propagating  inflation 
and  in  preventing  the  usual  instruments  of  inflation  control 
from  operating. 

By  the  mid-1980s,  domestic  debt  nearly  displaced  foreign 
debt  as  Brazil's  main  economic  problem.  During  the  high- 
growth  1970s,  a  significant  portion  of  foreign  borrowing  had 
been  by  state  enterprises,  which  were  the  main  actors  in  the 
import-substitution  industrialization  strategy.  Initially,  they  bor- 
rowed to  finance  their  investments.  However,  toward  the  end  of 
the  decade,  with  the  acute  shortage  of  foreign  exchange,  the 
government  forced  state  enterprises  to  borrow  unnecessarily, 
increasing  their  indebtedness  markedly.  Their  situation  wors- 
ened with  the  sharp  rise  in  international  interest  rates  in  the 
late  1970s,  the  devaluations  of  the  austerity  program,  and  the 
decreasing  real  prices  of  goods  and  services  provided  by  the 
public  enterprises  stemming  from  price  controls.  Because  the 
state  enterprises  were  not  allowed  to  go  bankrupt,  their  debt 


176 


The  Economy 


burden  was  transferred  gradually  to  the  government,  further 
increasing  the  public  debt.  This,  and  a  growing  disorganization 
of  the  public  sector,  transformed  the  public  debt  into  a  major 
economic  problem.  By  the  mid-1980s,  the  financial  burden 
stemming  from  the  debt  was  contributing  decisively  to  its  rapid 
expansion. 

The  1985-89  Period 

During  the  second  half  of  the  1980s,  it  became  increasingly 
clear  that  a  large-scale  fiscal  reform,  one  that  enabled  noninfla- 
tionary  financing  of  the  public  sector,  was  needed  not  only  to 
control  inflation  but  also  to  restore  the  public  sector's  capacity 
to  invest.  Both  were  essential  for  an  economic  recovery.  How- 
ever, political  obstacles  prevented  the  reform  from  materializ- 
ing. And,  because  inflation  had  become  the  most  visible 
symptom  of  the  public-sector  disequilibrium,  there  were  sev- 
eral attempts  to  bring  inflation  under  control  through  what 
came  to  be  known  as  "heterodox  economic  shocks."  The 
period  saw  three  such  shocks:  the  Cruzado  Plan  (1986),  the 
Bresser  Plan  (1987),  and  the  Summer  Plan  (1989). 

The  objective  of  the  Cruzado  Plan  was  to  eliminate  inflation 
with  a  dramatic  blow.  Between  1980  and  1985,  the  rise  in  the 
GPI  had  escalated  from  86.3  percent  to  248.5  percent  annually. 
Early  in  1986,  the  situation  became  desperate,  prodding  the 
implementation  of  the  plan.  Its  main  measures  were  a  general 
price  freeze,  a  wage  readjustment  and  freeze,  readjustment  and 
freeze  on  rents  and  mortgage  payments,  a  ban  on  indexation, 
and  a  freeze  on  the  exchange  rate. 

The  plan's  immediate  results  were  spectacular:  the  monthly 
rate  of  inflation  fell  close  to  zero,  economic  growth  surged 
upward,  and  the  foreign  accounts  remained  under  control. 
However,  by  the  end  of  1986  the  plan  was  in  trouble.  The  wage 
adjustments  were  too  large,  increasing  aggregate  demand 
excessively  and  creating  inflationary  pressures.  Moreover,  the 
price  freeze  was  maintained  for  too  long,  creating  distortions 
and  leading  to  shortages  of  a  growing  number  of  products.  The 
plan  could  have  been  rescued  if  adjustments  had  been  made  at 
crucial  moments.  Instead,  inflation  accelerated  again,  and 
there  was  a  return  of  indexation. 

The  two  other  stabilization  plans  amounted  to  renewed 
attempts  at  bringing  inflation  down  from  very  high  levels.  It 
was  soon  clear  that  without  a  thorough  reform  of  the  public 
sector,  controlling  inflation  would  be  impossible.  Both  plans 


177 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 


introduced  a  price  freeze  and  eliminated  indexation,  but  there 
were  differences  between  them,  and  with  the  Cruzado  Plan. 
Neither  was  able  to  address  the  public-sector  disequilibrium 
effectively.  The  objective  of  the  Summer  Plan,  for  instance,  was 
mainly  to  avoid  hyperinflation  in  an  election  year. 

In  fact,  the  public-sector  disequilibrium  became  virtually 
locked  in  as  a  result  of  the  1988  constitution,  which  created 
advantages  for  various  segments  of  society  without  indicating 
how  these  advantages  would  be  paid  for.  Moreover,  it  trans- 
ferred large  portions  of  the  tax  revenues  from  the  federal  gov- 
ernment to  state  and  municipal  governments,  without 
requiring  them  to  provide  additional  public  services.  With  less 
revenue  and  more  responsibility,  the  federal  accounts  experi- 
enced growing  deficits.  In  addition,  several  subsidies  were 
locked  into  the  legislation.  These  factors  and  the  financial  bur- 
den of  the  public  debt  meant  growing  problems  of  public 
finance. 

The  1980s  ended  with  high  and  accelerating  inflation  and  a 
stagnant  economy,  which  never  recovered  after  the  demise  of 
the  Cruzado  Plan.  The  public  debt  was  enormous,  and  the  gov- 
ernment was  required  to  pay  very  high  interest  rates  to  per- 
suade the  public  to  continue  to  buy  government  debt 
instruments  (see  also  Trade  Policies,  this  ch.). 

The  1990-94  Period 

The  first  post-military-regime  president  elected  by  popular 
suffrage,  Fernando  Collor  de  Mello  (1990-92),  was  sworn  into 
office  in  March  1990.  Facing  imminent  hyperinflation  and  a 
virtually  bankrupt  public  sector,  the  new  administration  intro- 
duced a  stabilization  plan,  together  with  a  set  of  reforms, 
aimed  at  removing  restrictions  on  free  enterprise,  increasing 
competition,  privatizing  public  enterprises,  and  boosting  pro- 
ductivity. 

Heralded  as  a  definitive  blow  to  inflation,  the  stabilization 
plan  was  drastic.  It  imposed  an  eighteen-month  freeze  on  all 
but  a  small  portion  of  the  private  sector's  financial  assets,  froze 
prices,  and  again  abolished  indexation.  The  new  administra- 
tion also  introduced  provisional  taxes  to  deal  with  the  fiscal  cri- 
sis, and  took  steps  to  reform  the  public  sector  by  closing  several 
public  agencies  and  dismissing  public  servants.  These  mea- 
sures were  expected  not  only  to  swiftly  reduce  inflation  but  also 
to  lower  inflationary  expectations. 


178 


The  Economy 


However,  few  of  the  new  administration's  programs  suc- 
ceeded. Major  difficulties  with  the  stabilization  and  reform 
programs  were  caused  in  part  by  the  superficial  nature  of  many 
of  the  administration's  actions  and  by  its  inability  to  secure 
political  support.  Moreover,  the  stabilization  plan  failed 
because  of  management  errors  coupled  with  defensive  actions 
by  segments  of  society  that  would  be  most  directly  hurt  by  the 
plan. 

After  falling  more  than  80  percent  in  March  1990,  the  GPI's 
monthly  rate  of  growth  began  increasing  again.  The  best  that 
could  be  achieved  was  to  stabilize  the  GPI  at  a  high  and  slowly 
rising  level.  In  January  1991,  it  rose  by  19.9  percent,  reaching 
32  percent  a  month  by  July  1993.  Simultaneously,  political 
instability  increased  sharply,  with  negative  impacts  on  the  econ- 
omy. The  real  GDP  declined  4.0  percent  in  1990,  increased 
only  1.1  percent  in  1991,  and  again  declined  0.9  percent  in 
1992  (see  table  7,  Appendix). 

President  Collor  de  Mello  was  impeached  in  September 
1992  on  charges  of  corruption.  Vice  President  Itamar  Franco 
was  sworn  in  as  president  (1992-94),  but  he  had  to  grapple  to 
form  a  stable  cabinet  and  to  gather  political  support.  The  weak- 
ness of  the  interim  administration  prevented  it  from  tackling 
inflation  effectively.  In  1993  the  economy  grew  again,  but  with 
inflation  rates  higher  than  30  percent  a  month,  the  chances  of 
a  durable  recovery  appeared  to  be  very  slim.  At  the  end  of  the 
year,  it  was  widely  acknowledged  that  without  serious  fiscal 
reform,  inflation  would  remain  high  and  the  economy  would 
not  sustain  growth.  This  acknowledgment  and  the  pressure  of 
rapidly  accelerating  inflation  finally  jolted  the  government  into 
action.  The  president  appointed  a  determined  minister  of 
finance,  Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso,  and  a  high-level  team 
was  put  in  place  to  develop  a  new  stabilization  plan.  Imple- 
mented early  in  1994,  the  plan  met  little  public  resistance 
because  it  was  discussed  widely  and  it  avoided  price  freezes. 

The  stabilization  program  had  three  stages:  the  introduction 
of  an  equilibrium  budget  mandated  by  the  National  Congress 
(Congresso  Nacional;  hereafter,  Congress);  a  process  of  gen- 
eral indexation  (prices,  wages,  taxes,  contracts,  and  financial 
assets);  and  the  introduction  of  a  new  currency,  the  real  (for 
value  of  the  real  (R$) — see  Glossary),  pegged  to  the  dollar.  The 
legally  enforced  balanced  budget  would  remove  expectations 
regarding  inflationary  behavior  by  the  public  sector.  By  allow- 
ing a  realignment  of  relative  prices,  general  indexation  would 


179 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

pave  the  way  for  monetary  reform.  Once  this  realignment  was 
achieved,  the  new  currency  would  be  introduced,  accompa- 
nied by  appropriate  policies  (especially  the  control  of  expendi- 
tures through  high  interest  rates  and  the  liberalization  of  trade 
to  increase  competition  and  thus  prevent  speculative  behav- 
ior). 

By  the  end  of  the  first  quarter  of  1994,  the  second  stage  of 
the  stabilization  plan  was  being  implemented.  Economists  of 
different  schools  of  thought  considered  the  plan  sound  and 
technically  consistent. 

The  Labor  Force  and  Income  Levels 

Substantial  growth  and  structural  transformations  raised 
Brazil's  per  capita  income  from  the  low-income  range  in  the 
late  1950s  to  the  upper  middle-income  range  in  1980.  Despite 
the  economic  problems  of  the  1980s,  per  capita  income 
remained  in  the  upper  middle-income  range.  Structural 
change  had  an  important  effect  on  employment  and  earnings 
and  on  income  distribution  and  poverty. 

Employment  and  Earnings 

Employment 

Since  World  War  II,  the  level  of  employment  in  Brazil  has 
coincided  generally  with  the  expansion  of  the  country's  labor 
force.  However,  there  have  been  considerable  changes  in  the 
occupational  structure  (see  fig.  7).  The  period  from  1950  to 
1970  witnessed  slow  growth  in  agricultural  employment  and  a 
rapid  increase  in  typically  urban  occupations,  notably  com- 
merce and  services  but  also  industry  (manufacturing,  construc- 
tion, and  mining).  The  period  from  1970  to  1980  was  one  of 
very  rapid  growth  in  employment,  led  by  industry,  resulting 
from  a  decade  of  marked  economic  expansion.  The  period 
between  1980  and  1990  saw  an  expansion  of  employment,  led 
by  segments  of  the  services  sector,  despite  the  sluggish  econ- 
omy. 

In  the  1950-70  phase,  the  employed  population  went  from 
17.1  million  people  to  29.6  million,  increasing  at  a  2.7  percent 
annual  rate,  similar  to  the  rate  of  population  growth.  This 
expansion  was  led  by  the  services  sector,  with  4.6  percent 
annual  growth.  Industrial  employment  also  expanded  signifi- 
cantly, with  3.9  percent  annual  growth.  However,  industrial 
labor  expansion  was  quite  a  bit  slower  than  the  sector's  growth 


180 


The  Economy 


in  real  product  in  the  period  (7.9  percent  annually).  In  turn, 
employment  in  the  primary  sector  experienced  only  a  small 
increase  of  1.3  percent  annually,  much  less  than  the  sector's 
growth  in  real  product  in  the  period  (4.5  percent  annually).  In 
the  1950s  and  1960s,  the  output  elasticity  (see  Glossary)  of 
employment  was  very  small,  not  only  for  agriculture  but  also 
for  industry,  the  economy's  dynamic  sector. 

The  share  of  agriculture  in  total  employment  fell  from 
almost  60  percent  in  1950  to  44.3  percent  in  1970,  that  of  the 
industrial  sector  increased  from  14.2  percent  to  17.9  percent, 
and  that  of  the  services  sector  increased  from  25.9  percent  to 
37.8  percent.  Another  change  in  the  period  was  the  increase  in 
the  number  of  women  in  the  labor  force,  from  13.6  to  18.5  per- 
cent. The  male  participation  rate  declined  from  80.8  to  71.8 
percent. 

The  1970-80  period  saw  very  rapid  economic  expansion.  In 
the  1970s,  GDP  grew  8.7  percent  annually;  industry,  9.5  per- 
cent; and  agriculture,  4.4  percent.  In  the  same  period,  the 
employed  population  increased  3.9  percent  annually,  from 
29.6  million  to  43.9  million  persons.  This  time,  the  expansion 
in  total  employment  was  led  by  industry,  with  a  6.7  percent 
annual  growth  rate.  The  services  sector's  labor  force  grew  5.9 
percent  annually.  As  a  result  of  conservative  modernization, 
agriculture's  labor  force  experienced  a  small  reduction,  from 
13.3  million  persons  in  1970  to  13.0  million  in  1980. 

By  1980  the  share  of  agricultural  employment  had  fallen  to 
30.1  percent,  that  of  industry  had  increased  to  23.9  percent, 
and  that  of  the  services  sector,  to  46.0  percent.  The  number  of 
women  in  the  labor  force  continued  to  increase,  from  18.5  per- 
cent in  1970  to  27.4  percent  in  1980;  the  male  participation 
rate  changed  little,  from  71.8  to  72.4  percent. 

During  the  1980-90  period,  total  employment  increased, 
despite  the  sluggish  economy.  Between  1981  and  1990,  the 
average  rate  of  GDP  growth  was  only  1.6  percent  annually; 
industry  averaged  only  0.5  percent  annual  growth;  agriculture, 
2.6  percent;  and  the  services  sector,  2.7  percent.  Total  employ- 
ment, however,  increased  2.8  percent  annually,  from  43.9  mil- 
lion to  62.1  million  persons.  The  average  rate  of 
unemployment  in  the  period  jumped  from  around  4  percent 
in  the  still  prosperous  years  of  1979  and  1980  to  more  than  6 
percent  (average  for  the  nine  major  metropolitan  regions)  in 
the  depressed  1981-84  period;  thereafter,  it  declined,  falling  to

3.6  percent  in  1986.  However,  even  with  the  return  of  stagna- 
tion, open  unemployment  increased  only  slightly. 

Despite  a  decline  of  4.0  percent  in  GDP,  the  unemployment 
rate  was  only  4.3  percent  in  1990,  as  opposed  to  7.9  percent  in 
1981.  Meanwhile,  an  extensive  informal  economy  (see  Glos- 
sary) expanded,  acting  as  a  cushion  and  absorbing  a  growing 
number  of  people  that  the  formal  sector  failed  to  employ.  The 
informal  sector  included  not  only  large  numbers  of  street  ven- 
dors, peddlers,  and  providers  of  petty  services  but  also  large 
numbers  of  middle-class  workers  as  artisans,  self-employed 
agents,  and  backyard  business  operators.  Moreover,  established 
businesses  used  the  informal  sector  as  a  means  of  avoiding 


182 


The  Economy 


taxes,  increased  regulations,  and  the  costs  associated  with 
being  registered  as  employed. 

Brazil  lacks  precise  data  on  informal-sector  employment,  but 
there  are  indications  of  its  expansion  since  1980.  For  instance, 
between  1980  and  1990  the  share  of  employees  in  the  total 
employed  urban  labor  force  fell  from  78.7  percent  to  74.6  per- 
cent, and  the  share  of  the  self-employed  (many  in  the  informal 
sector)  rose  from  17.2  percent  to  19.1  percent.  Furthermore, 
the  proportion  of  workers  with  formal  labor  contracts  declined 
considerably  in  most  urban  economic  segments.  This  was  cer- 
tainly true  in  areas  where  the  informal  sector  traditionally  has 
prevailed,  such  as  personal  services,  entertainment,  construc- 
tion, and  commerce;  but,  it  was  also  true  in  the  more  orga- 
nized sectors,  such  as  manufacturing. 

In  the  1990-92  period,  the  economy  deteriorated  further, 
with  a  1.3  percent  annual  decline  in  GDP  and  4.1  percent 
decline  in  industrial  output.  Agriculture  grew  only  1.5  percent, 
and  the  services  sector,  only  0.4  percent  annually.  The  overall 
unemployment  rate  increased  from  3.4  percent  in  1989  to  4.3 
percent  in  1990,  4.2  percent  in  1991,  and  5.8  percent  in  1992. 
The  labor  absorption  by  the  informal  sector  continued  to  be 
large  and  highly  visible. 

In  1992  the  share  of  agriculture  in  the  country's  employed 
labor  was  9.4  percent  and  that  of  industry,  16.0  percent.  As  a 
result  of  the  swollen  informal  sector,  employment  in  the  ser- 
vices sector  increased  to  57.4  percent.  The  female  participation 
rate  continued  to  increase,  from  27.4  percent  in  1980  to  38.9 
percent  in  1990.  In  1990  women  made  up  35.5  percent  of  the 
labor  force  compared  with  15  percent  in  1950.  The  male  partic- 
ipation rate  increased  from  72.4  to  75.3  percent  between  1980 
and  1990. 

Earnings 

There  are  two  constants  regarding  earnings  in  Brazil  since 
World  War  II:  the  very  low  wages  of  unskilled  labor  and  the 
wide  disparity  in  the  wage  scale.  An  indication  of  the  low  wage 
levels  for  unskilled  labor  is  the  minimum  wage.  In  1961  the 
monthly  minimum  wage  averaged  only  US$113.30  (in  1986 
dollars).  The  index  of  the  average  real  minimum  wage  exhibits 
a  clear  downward  trend  (see  table  8,  Appendix).  The  1991  real 
average  monthly  minimum  wage  was  less  than  one-third  of  the 
already  low  1961  minimum  wage.

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

It  is  interesting  to  observe  the  impact  of  recession  and  par- 
ticularly inflation  on  the  real  minimum  wage.  The  two  periods 
of  swift  decline  in  the  real  minimum  wage  were  characterized 
by  recession  and  by  a  rapidly  accelerating  inflation.  This  was 
true  in  the  1961-65  period  and  especially  so  between  1982  and 
1991.  The  prosperity  and  comparatively  low  inflation  of  the 
1970s  (notably  during  the  first  half  of  the  decade)  did  not 
bring  about  a  stronger  recovery  of  the  real  value  of  the  mini- 
mum wage  only  because  of  the  repressive  wage  policy  adopted 
by  the  military  regime. 

The  1990  household  survey  revealed  that  30.8  percent 
(some  19.9  million  persons)  of  the  employed  population 
earned  one  minimum  wage  or  less.  Even  allowing  for  underes- 
timations  of  earnings  by  the  household  surveys,  the  numbers 
living  with  very  low  wages  in  Brazil  are  indeed  large. 

Organized  labor,  which  has  substantially  larger  average  earn- 
ings, has  obtained  considerable  gains  since  the  late  1970s. 
These  gains  are  reflected  in  the  index  of  average  real  wage  in 
Sao  Paulo,  the  core  of  the  country's  modern  industrial  sector. 
The  index  evolved  from  a  level  of  100  in  1978  to  125.1  in  1982, 
declined  to  112.9  in  1983,  but  jumped  to  175.9  in  prosperous 
1986.  After  this  it  decreased  somewhat,  reaching  165.9  in  1990 
and  158.4  in  1992. 

As  for  the  disparity  in  the  wage  scale,  according  to  the  1990 
household  survey,  in  September  of  that  year  10.8  percent  of 
the  employed  work  force,  or  6.5  million  persons,  earned  one- 
half  of  a  minimum  wage,  a  monthly  average  of  US$299;  49.2 
percent  of  the  employed  work  force,  or  29.8  million  persons, 
received  two  minimum  wages  or  less.  At  the  other  extreme,  7.8 
percent  of  the  employed  work  force  received  more  than  ten 
minimum  wages,  a  monthly  average  of  US$1,941;  3.2  percent, 
or  1.9  million  persons,  earned  more  than  twenty  minimum 
wages,  or  a  monthly  average  of  US$4,000.  In  that  year,  more 
than  60  percent  of  the  employed  labor  force  earned  less  than 
the  average  monthly  earnings  of  US$211. 

Moreover,  data  on  the  distribution  of  monthly  earnings 
reveal  that  the  distributive  disparity  has  increased  over  time.  In 
1960  the  poorest  10  percent  of  the  employed  labor  force  with 
earnings  received  1.9  percent  of  the  total  earnings,  but  in  1990 
their  share  was  only  0.8  percent.  At  the  other  extreme,  the  rich- 
est 10  percent  increased  their  share  of  total  earnings  from  39.6 
percent  in  1960  to  44.1  percent  in  1990.

The  Economy 


Inequality  and  Poverty 

Income  inequality  in  Brazil  has  a  personal  and  a  regional 
dimension.  The  highly  concentrated  distribution  of  income 
worsened  in  the  1960  to  1990  period.  The  Gini  coefficient  (see 
Glossary)  for  the  country  as  a  whole  increased  from  0.50  in 
1960  to  0.56  in  1970,  0.59  in  1980,  and  0.63  in  1990.  The  1990 
coefficient  means  that  the  richest  5  percent  of  the  population 
received  36.6  percent  of  the  national  income,  while  the  poorest 
40  percent  received  only  7.2  percent.  Moreover,  the  pattern  of 
income  distribution  was  similar  in  all  of  Brazil's  five  regions.  In 
1988  the  South  had  the  lowest  Gini  coefficient  (0.58)  and  the 
Northeast  had  the  highest  (0.64).  The  difference  is  not 
remarkable;  inequality  is  pervasive. 

A  substantial  number  of  Brazilians  are  poor  because  Brazil 
has  a  large  population,  a  medium-range  income  per  capita  (as 
compared  with  the  United  States,  which  is  in  the  high  range), 
and  a  high  level  of  inequality.  Estimates  indicate  that  in  1990 
almost  a  third  of  Brazil's  total  population,  or  39.1  million  per- 
sons, were  poor.  Approximately  half  of  these  poor  lived  in  rural 
areas  and  half  in  urban  areas.  In  relative  terms,  however,  the 
proportion  of  the  urban  poor  (22.5  percent)  was  substantially 
lower  than  that  of  the  rural  poor  (50.1  percent).  The  rural  to 
urban  migration  since  1950  markedly  reduced  the  rural  popu- 
lation, but  it  did  not  improve  the  lot  of  those  who  remained 
behind. 

As  for  regional  inequality,  in  1991  the  more  developed 
Southeast  and  South  regions,  which  occupy  17.6  percent  of 
Brazil's  total  territory,  had  58.7  percent  of  the  total  population 
and  generated  74.3  percent  of  the  country's  GDP  (in  1985).  By 
contrast,  the  poverty-stricken  Northeast,  which  occupies  18.3 
percent  of  the  total  area,  had  28.5  percent  of  the  total  popula- 
tion and  generated  only  13.1  percent  of  Brazil's  1985  GDP.  The 
huge  North  (Norte)  and  Center-West  (Centro-Oeste)  regions, 
which  occupy  64.1  percent  of  Brazil's  total  area,  had  12.8  per- 
cent of  the  total  population  and  generated  12.6  percent  of  Bra- 
zil's 1985  GDP.  The  Southeast  had  the  largest  urbanization  rate 
(88.3  percent  in  1991);  the  Northeast  had  the  second  largest 
proportion  of  the  population  in  rural  areas  (41.6  percent  in 
1991),  slightly  below  that  of  the  frontier  North  (43.9  percent). 

As  a  result  of  the  economic  boom,  Brazil's  per  capita  income 
experienced  a  marked  increase  in  the  1970s,  from  US$1,253  to 
US$2,266;  in  the  stagnant  1980s,  it  declined,  reaching 
US$2,154  in  1990.  In  1970  the  per  capita  income  of  the  South- 


185 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

east  exceeded  the  national  average  by  53.2  percent,  while  that 
of  the  Northeast  was  44.4  percent  lower.  This  discrepancy  has 
declined,  but  only  marginally:  in  1988  the  per  capita  income  of 
the  Southeast  was  43.6  percent  higher  than  the  national  aver- 
age, and  that  of  the  Northeast  was  37.5  percent  lower.  Of  Bra- 
zil's 39.1  million  poor  in  1990,  53.1  percent  were  in  the 
Northeast  and  25.4  percent  were  in  the  prosperous  Southeast. 
In  the  Northeast,  the  majority  of  the  poor  lived  in  rural  areas, 
while  in  the  Southeast  the  largest  portion  of  the  poor  lived  in 
cities. 

Brazil's  major  urban  areas  warrant  examination,  given  the 
large  and  growing  number  of  urban  poor.  In  1991  nine  Metro- 
politan Regions  (MRs),  including  Belem,  in  the  North;  For- 
taleza,  Recife,  and  Salvador  in  the  Northeast;  Belo  Horizonte, 
Rio  de  Janeiro,  and  Sao  Paulo  in  the  Southeast;  and  Curitiba 
and  Porto  Alegre  in  the  South,  had  a  combined  population  of 
42.7  million  people,  almost  one-third  of  Brazil's  total  popula- 
tion. The  smallest  MR,  Belem  in  the  Amazon,  had  1.3  million 
inhabitants,  and  the  largest,  Sao  Paulo,  had  more  than  15  mil- 
lion inhabitants.  The  three  largest  MRs  were  in  the  Southeast. 
They  had  a  combined  population  of  28.6  million,  nearly  67 
percent  of  the  total  metropolitan  population  and  almost  20 
percent  of  Brazil's  total  population.  The  four  MRs  in  the 
North/Northeast  had  a  combined  population  of  9.0  million — a 
large  number  for  an  underdeveloped  or  frontier  area.  The 
South's  two  MRs  had  a  combined  population  of  5.0  million. 

The  metropolitan  Gini  coefficients  for  1970  and  1988  show 
that  all  the  MRs  except  for  Curitiba  experienced  a  deteriora- 
tion in  income  distribution.  The  coefficients  for  1988  also  show 
that  the  distribution  of  income  was  worse  in  the  Northeast  MRs 
and  better  in  Sao  Paulo  and  in  the  two  Southern  MRs,  but  the 
differences  were  not  large. 

The  metropolitan  average  household  real  income  shows  that 
all  MRs,  except  for  Rio  de  Janeiro,  had  increases  between  1970 
and  1988.  In  1970  and  in  1988,  the  average  household  incomes 
of  the  North-Northeast  MRs  were  significantly  lower  than  those 
of  the  Southeast-South.  However,  the  gap  between  the  two 
groups  has  declined  somewhat.  In  1970  the  average  household 
income  of  Fortaleza  (the  MR  with  the  lowest  average)  was  only 
36.6  percent  of  that  of  Sao  Paulo  (with  the  highest  average);  in 
1988  this  average  had  increased  to  53.3  percent.  This  does  not 
mean  that  the  Northeast  MRs  were  prospering.  Rather,  it 
means  that  Sao  Paulo,  flooded  with  migrants,  had  a  sharp

increase  in  the  number  of  households,  moderating  the  rise  in 
its  average  household  income. 

Estimates  indicate  that  in  1990  the  nine  MRs  had  a  com- 
bined total  number  of  poor  of  almost  12.3  million  people,  or 
28.9  percent  of  the  total  population  of  the  MRs.  Sao  Paulo  and 
Rio  de  Janeiro  had  the  largest  absolute  number  of  poor  (over  3 
million,  or  nearly  24  percent  of  the  total  MR  poor  each),  but 
the  highest  levels  of  urban  poverty  were  in  the  MRs  of  the 
North/Northeast. 

In  1989  the  proportion  of  the  poor  unemployed  was  11  per- 
cent, while  that  of  the  rest  of  the  work  force  was  only  3  percent. 
The  proportion  of  the  poor  employed  in  informal  occupations 
was  38  percent,  while  that  of  the  remaining  population  was  26 
percent  (still  quite  a  high  percentage).  And,  the  proportion  of 
poor  children,  age  seven  to  fourteen,  out  of  school  was  14  per- 
cent, while  that  of  the  nonpoor  was  only  6  percent. 

Structure  of  Production 

The  growth  and  diversification  that  took  place  after  World 
War  II  brought  considerable  changes  to  the  productive  struc- 
ture of  the  Brazilian  economy.  The  share  of  the  agricultural 
sector  in  GDP  declined  from  24.3  percent  in  1950  to  11  per- 
cent in  1993.  In  the  same  1950  to  1993  period,  the  share  of 
industry  increased  from  24.1  percent  to  29  percent,  if  this  sec- 
tor includes  manufacturing,  mining,  and  construction  (see  fig. 
8).  The  share  of  agriculture  in  total  employment  dropped  from 
62  percent  in  1950  to  29.2  percent  in  1994,  and  that  of  services 
increased  from  25  to  43.6  percent.  (Taking  into  account  the 
informal  economy,  the  services  sector  totaled  56  percent  of 
GDP  in  1993,  depending  on  the  source  of  information.)  Yet, 
despite  the  industrialization  that  took  place,  the  share  of  indus- 
try in  total  employment  increased  only  from  13  to  23.4  percent 
between  1950  and  1994. 

Agriculture 

When  examining  the  behavior  of  the  agricultural  sector  in 
the  postwar  years,  it  is  possible  to  identify  two  distinct  periods: 
horizontal  (geographical)  expansion  from  1949  to  1969  and 
conservative  modernization,  from  1970  to  the  present.  In  the 
immediate  postwar  years,  Brazilian  agriculture  included  an 
export  sector  that  relied  heavily  on  coffee  but  also  on  cotton, 
sugar,  and  a  few  minor  commodities,  and  a  semisubsistence

sector  that  produced  for  the  domestic  market.  At  the  time,  the 
country's  population,  its  per  capita  income,  and  its  urban  sec- 
tor did  not  yet  impose  a  large  demand  on  the  agricultural  sec- 
tor. With  import-substitution  industrialization,  however,  the 
situation  changed  drastically.  This  particular  industrialization 
strategy  required  that  the  agricultural  sector  generate  most  of 
the  economy's  foreign  exchange,  produce  growing  outputs  of 
food  and  some  industrial  inputs,  and  transfer  resources  for 
import-substitution  industrialization.  The  transfer  mechanism 
was  a  tax  on  the  foreign  exchange  earned  by  coffee  exports 
and  the  persistent  implicit  taxation  of  agriculture.  The  virtual 
exclusion  of  many  agricultural  products  from  the  world  market 


188 


The  Economy 


was  caused  by  the  highly  overvalued  cruzeiro,  which  resulted 
from  this  strategy.  Consequently,  the  cheap  domestic  food  pol- 
icy that  prevailed  depressed  prices  in  favor  of  the  urban-indus- 
trial sector. 

Paradoxically,  the  overall  performance  of  agriculture  during 
the  horizontal  expansion  period  was  adequate.  Agricultural 
GDP  increased  4.2  percent  a  year  between  1949  and  1969,  a 
considerably  higher  growth  rate  than  that  of  the  population; 
between  1950  and  1959,  food  production  increased  5.4  percent 
a  year,  and  the  production  of  exportables  rose  4.1  percent 
annually.  A  major  factor  in  this  performance  was  horizontal 
expansion,  that  is,  the  incorporation  of  new  land,  especially 
along  the  agricultural  frontier,  made  possible  by  an  aggressive 
policy  of  road  construction  (see  Frontier  Expansion  That 
Shaped  Brazil,  ch.  1).  Moreover,  the  disincentives  of  the 
import-substitution  industrialization  policies  were  circum- 
vented by  maintaining  ample  access  to  land  at  concessionary 
terms  for  the  landowning  elite  and  for  commercial  farmers, 
reproducing  a  pattern  established  early  in  the  colonial  period. 

By  the  late  1960s,  it  was  clear  that  horizontal  growth  of  agri- 
culture was  reaching  its  limits  rapidly  and  that  increases  in  pro- 
ductivity would  be  essential  for  a  continued  expansion  of 
production.  Moreover,  the  growth  strategy  of  the  military 
regime  required  a  fast  expansion  of  exports,  including  agricul- 
tural commodities.  Thus,  the  government  implemented  a  con- 
servative modernization  strategy  consisting  of  technical  change 
for  a  restricted  number  of  subsectors  and  incentives  for  the  for- 
mation of  agribusiness  complexes. 

Technical  change  involved  the  development  and  adaptation 
of  green-revolution  technologies,  geared  mainly  toward  large 
agricultural  operations  that  had  important  roles  for  mechani- 
zation and  chemical  inputs.  Regarding  the  agribusiness  com- 
plexes, the  government  provided  strong  incentives  for  the 
creation  and  expansion  of  processing  industries  and  for  the 
development  and  modernization  of  agricultural  input  indus- 
tries. Moreover,  the  agricultural  phase  of  the  soymeal  and  oil, 
instant  coffee,  processed  beef,  poultry,  orange  juice,  and  sugar 
and  alcohol  agribusiness  complexes  received  subsidized  credit, 
guaranteed  prices,  and  tax  exemptions  and  subsidies  when 
exported.  Traditional,  unprocessed,  agricultural  products, 
however,  were  subjected  to  heavy  taxation  and  to  price  and 
other  controls.  As  in  the  import-substitution  industrialization 
phase,  the  production  of  cheap  food  was  required,  but  only 


189

recently  have  government  policies  begun  specifically  to  address 

this  need. 

Products  benefiting  from  agricultural  modernization 
responded  well  to  the  conservative  modernization  strategy. 
Their  production  methods  underwent  considerable  technical 
change,  and  their  production  and  yields  increased  markedly. 
Traditional  products,  however,  failed  to  modernize  and  tended 
to  perform  poorly.  They  had  scant  access  to  credit  and  to  the 
price-support  policy.  Moreover,  they  were  frequently  subjected 
to  price  controls,  to  a  maze  of  regulations  and  export  restric- 
tions and  quotas,  and  to  competition  from  subsidized  imports 
when  they  failed  to  supply  the  domestic  market  adequately. 

At  the  beginning  of  the  1990s,  the  main  crops  in  the  modern 
segment  were  cocoa,  cotton,  rice,  sugarcane,  oranges,  corn, 
soybeans,  and  wheat;  those  in  the  traditional  segment  included 
beans,  manioc  (cassava),  bananas,  peanuts,  and  coffee  (see 
table  9,  Appendix).  Brazil  is  also  one  of  the  largest  exporters  of 
guavas,  lemons,  mangoes,  passion  fruit,  tangerines,  and 
tobacco.  Crop  production  between  1970  and  1990  shows  that 
the  components  of  the  modern  segment  grew  considerably, 
both  in  production  and  in  yield,  while  those  of  the  traditional 
segment  stagnated  or  declined.  The  growth  in  export  crops 
allowed  Brazil  to  become  one  of  the  world's  largest  soybean 
producers  and  to  earn  needed  foreign  exchange.  It  also 
allowed  the  substitution  of  sugarcane  alcohol  for  imported  oil. 

Livestock 

Brazil's  livestock  sector  went  through  a  similar  process  of 
selective  modernization.  Until  the  early  1970s,  it  remained 
quite  backward;  its  expansion  relied  chiefly  on  the  incorpora- 
tion of  more  land  and  animals  into  production.  Following  the 
expansion  of  agribusiness  complexes,  livestock  production  pro- 
cesses also  changed.  However,  major  differences  exist  between 
the  modern  and  the  traditional  segments  of  the  beef-cattle, 
poultry,  and  swine  subsectors — the  country's  main  livestock 
subsectors. 

Between  1970  and  1991,  Brazil's  beef-cattle  herd  grew  at  a 
3.1  percent  average  yearly  rate,  from  78.5  million  to  152.1  mil- 
lion head;  the  slaughter  of  beef-cattle  increased  from  9.6  mil- 
lion to  13.9  million  head;  and  the  total  carcass  weight  increased 
from  1.8  million  to  2.9  million  tons.  However,  these  numbers 
hide  large  regional  differences  (see  table  11,  Appendix).  The 
beef-cattle  industry  in  areas  near  the  country's  more  developed 


190 


The  Economy 


core  has  experienced  considerable  modernization,  interlocked 
with  the  expansion  of  a  dynamic  agribusiness  sector,  which  sup- 
plies the  industry  with  modern  inputs  and  slaughters  and  pro- 
cesses its  animals  for  domestic  and  world  markets.  As  a  result, 
Brazil's  beef  exports  increased  from  98,300  tons  of  chilled  beef 
and  15,800  tons  of  processed  beef  in  1970,  at  a  total  value  of 
US$298.6  million  (in  1992  dollars),  to  96,800  tons  of  chilled 
beef  and  127,300  tons  of  processed  beef  in  1992,  at  a  total  value 
of  US$618.1  million.  A  still  substantial  traditional  beef-cattle 
industry  can  be  found  in  the  frontier  areas  or  in  the  more 
backward  parts  of  Brazil;  its  productivity  remains  very  low,  and 
it  is  plagued  by  serious  sanitary  and  management  problems. 

The  poultry  subsector  experienced  spectacular  improve- 
ments from  1970  to  1991,  changing  from  a  small,  backyard- 
based  production  into  a  modern  industry.  This  change  is 
reflected  in  the  fact  that,  while  the  poultry  flock  increased  2.8 
times  between  1970  and  1990,  from  214.3  million  to  594.3  mil- 
lion head,  the  total  carcass  weight  of  the  fowl  slaughtered  com- 
mercially increased  twenty-one  times,  from  85,400  to  1.8 
million  tons.  Moreover,  the  export  of  poultry  products,  which 
in  1970  was  negligible,  in  1992  amounted  to  378,000  tons,  rep- 
resenting a  total  value  of  US$455.6  million.  The  transforma- 
tion of  the  poultry  subsector  into  a  modern  industry  was 
achieved  through  the  development  of  agribusiness  complexes. 
These  modern  enterprises  play  a  central  role;  they  provide 
farmers  with  inputs,  with  genetic  material,  and  with  technical 
assistance,  in  addition  to  buying  the  finished  poultry  from  the 
farmers. 

As  for  pork,  the  swine  herd  increased  only  33.9  percent 
between  1970  and  1991,  from  25.6  million  to  34.3  million  ani- 
mals. However,  a  small  portion  of  this  subsector  experienced 
considerable  changes,  also  induced  by  agribusiness.  Until  the 
early  1990s,  the  Brazilian  swine  herd  was  composed  over- 
whelmingly of  mixed  breeds  of  low-quality,  lard-producing  ani- 
mals. Moreover,  the  management  of  the  herd  was  primitive, 
and  poor  sanitation  was  a  problem.  The  growing  modern  seg- 
ment of  the  pork  industry  has  a  high-quality  herd  of  meat-pro- 
ducing animals.  Management  practices  have  improved 
considerably,  and  there  is  a  similar  interaction  between  farmers 
and  commercial  and  industrial  enterprises. 

Fishing 

With  the  exception  of  a  few  specialized  subsectors  geared  to 


191 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

the  world  market,  such  as  lobster  fishing,  Brazil's  fishing  indus- 
try has  not  developed  well,  despite  the  fiscal  incentives  it 
received  during  the  1970s.  Even  the  specialized  subsectors, 
including  fish,  crustaceans,  and  mollusks,  only  increased  from 
526,300  tons  in  1970  to  798,600  tons  in  1989. 

In  Brazil  fishing  is  undertaken  by  businesses  employing  fairly 
modern  equipment,  and  by  thousands  of  independent  fisher- 
men spread  along  Brazil's  immense  coastal  region.  Indepen- 
dent fishermen  employ  primitive  tools  and  fishing  methods, 
producing  for  self-consumption  and  for  sale  in  nearby  markets. 
With  some  exceptions,  the  commercial  segment  has  not 
expanded  significantly,  and  in  1989  the  production  of  fish  and 
related  catches  amounted  to  a  mere  5.3  kilograms  per  inhabit- 
ant. 

Industry 

After  1987  problems  that  had  confronted  industry  earlier  in 
the  decade  intensified,  adverse  macroeconomic  conditions 
persisted,  and  political  troubles  affected  expectations 
adversely.  Until  the  end  of  the  1980s,  industry  relied  heavily  on 
government  protection  and  favors,  but  it  also  faced  pervasive 
regulations  and  extensive  governmental  interference.  These 
factors  had  a  deleterious  effect  on  industrial  investment  and  on 
the  productivity  of  several  industrial  subsectors,  increasingly 
blunting  the  competitive  edge  they  had  struggled  to  achieve  in 
the  world  market.  Moreover,  as  a  result  of  the  fiscal  crisis,  the 
government  was  hard-pressed  to  continue  to  provide  support 
and  subsidies  for  industry  and  to  maintain  and  expand  the 
country's  infrastructure. 

The  Collor  de  Mello  administration,  inaugurated  in  1990, 
introduced  significant  changes  in  Brazil's  economic  strategy. 
Regarding  industry,  the  government  implemented  measures  to 
eliminate  regulations,  to  liberalize  trade,  and  to  markedly 
reduce  governmental  favors  and  subsidies.  It  also  announced  a 
series  of  actions  aimed  at  increasing  industry's  competitiveness. 
Despite  these  efforts,  political  and  macroeconomic  difficulties 
prevented  the  effective  implementation  of  the  new  strategy, 
and  the  mounting  fiscal  crisis  dampened  efforts  to  rebuild  and 
improve  the  badly  deteriorated  infrastructure.  Therefore,  an 
important  part  of  the  industrial  sector  failed  to  recover  and  to 
modernize.  With  stagnation,  the  domestic  market  could  not 
give  industry  a  dynamic  push.  Moreover,  the  reduction  in 
investment,  coupled  with  the  deteriorating  infrastructure,  led 


192 


The  Economy 


to  declines  in  competitiveness.  These  developments,  together 
with  fewer  import  barriers,  caused  industry's  balance  of  trade 
to  decline,  from  a  peak  of  US$16.3  billion  in  1988  to  US$11.1 
billion  in  1991.  In  the  early  1990s,  despite  sectoral  weaknesses, 
the  industrial  sector  became  a  major  contributor  to  the  coun- 
try's exports  and  trade  surplus. 

Mining 

Since  the  early  colonial  period,  expectations  have  loomed 
large  about  mineral  riches  hidden  in  Brazil's  vast  territory. 
However,  the  full  extent  of  the  country's  mineral  wealth  is  still 
unknown.  Various  efforts  have  been  made  to  survey  the  coun- 
try, one  of  which  uncovered  the  Greater  Carajas  mineral  prov- 
ince in  the  eastern  Amazon  (see  fig.  9) .  Yet,  at  the  beginning  of 
the  1990s  only  10  percent  of  the  country's  subsoil  was  known  in 
sufficient  detail.  Correspondingly,  the  share  of  mining  in  GDP 
has  increased  but  remains  small;  in  1950  it  was  only  0.4  per- 
cent, rising  to  0.8  percent  in  1970,  to  1.0  percent  in  1980,  and 
to  2.5  percent  in  1986,  but  declining  to  1.5  percent  in  1990. 

The  value  of  mineral  production  expanded  from  US$5.4  bil- 
lion in  1980  to  US$13.0  billion  in  1990.  However,  only  ten  min- 
erals— crude  oil,  iron,  gold,  calcium  ore,  natural  gas,  bauxite, 
phosphate,  granite,  cassiterite,  and  zinc — accounted  for  85.5 
percent  of  this  total;  crude  oil  alone  accounted  for  37.6  per- 
cent of  the  total,  and  both  iron  ore  and  gold  accounted  for 
11.4  percent  each.  Apparently,  the  exploration  of  several  other 
mineral  substances  has  great  potential,  but  such  efforts  have 
yet  to  be  realized. 

Advances  in  the  early  1990s  included  the  Greater  Carajas 
project,  which  involves  the  production  and  export  of  iron  ore, 
products  of  the  bauxite-aluminum  complex,  and  manganese, 
among  other  minerals.  Overall,  exports  of  mineral  products 
expanded  substantially,  and  there  was  a  considerable  import 
substitution  of  mineral  inputs.  In  1974  the  trade  balance  of  the 
mineral  sector  (primary,  semiprocessed,  and  manufactured 
minerals)  was  a  negative  US$2.5  billion,  and  the  deficit 
increased,  reaching  US$10.7  billion  in  1980.  However,  by  1985 
the  deficit  had  declined  to  US$0.6  billion  and  thereafter  the 
trade  balance  showed  growing  surpluses  (US$1.1  billion  in 
1988,  US$1.3  billion  in  1989,  and  US$1.6  billion  in  1990).  This 
reversal  was  caused  by  an  expansion  of  exports,  especially  of 
iron  ore,  products  of  the  bauxite-aluminum  complex,  and

manganese,  and  to  a  significant  extent  by  reductions  in  crude

Brazil's  mineral  policy  has  been  marked  strongly  by  national 
security  considerations.  Until  the  early  1990s,  foreign  capital 


194 


The  Economy 


was  mostly  barred  from  the  more  attractive  portions  of  the  sec- 
tor. Petroleum  has  been  a  state  monopoly.  Another  state  enter- 
prise, the  giant  Rio  Doce  Valley  Company,  Inc.  (Companhia 
Vale  do  Rio  Doce — CVRD),  has  a  large  share  of  the  iron  ore 
deposits,  and  it  has  played  an  important  role  in  the  develop- 
ment of  the  bauxite-aluminum  complex  and  of  other  minerals. 
CVRD  is  also  a  major  railroad  and  shipping  operator,  by  far 
Brazil's  largest  exporter,  and  its  largest  generator  of  foreign 
currency.  In  late  1994,  foreign  investment  funds  held  about  10 
percent  of  CVRD's  stock.  In  1995  there  were  still  legal  obstacles 
to  foreign  participation  in  Brazil's  mineral  sector. 

Energy 

The  unfolding  of  Brazil's  current  difficulties  in  the  energy 
arena  constitutes  a  classic  example  of  distortions  arising  from 
misdirected  regulation  combined  with  the  action  of  interest 
groups.  When  import-substitution  industrialization  began  in 
the  early  1950s,  the  country's  main  sources  of  energy  were  fire- 
wood, charcoal,  and  bagasse  (the  dry  residue  from  the  process- 
ing of  sugarcane).  Because  modern  industrial  expansion  could 
not  be  based  on  these,  a  decision  had  to  be  made  regarding  the 
sources  of  energy  to  be  used.  Not  surprisingly,  electricity  and 
petroleum  products  received  special  attention. 

Electric  Power 

In  1950  Brazil's  capacity  to  generate  electricity  was  only  1.9 
million  kilowatts,  and  most  of  the  required  petroleum  products 
had  to  be  imported.  An  adequate  supply  of  electric  energy 
became  critical,  both  for  production  and  for  a  rapidly  growing 
urban  population.  Petroleum  requirements  expanded  quickly 
because  of  the  decision  to  make  the  automobile  industry  the 
mainstay  of  import-substitution  industrialization  and  because 
of  the  heavy  reliance  on  trucks  for  short-  and  long-distance 
transportation.  Ambitious  road-building  programs  were  imple- 
mented, and  the  domestic  automobile  industry  quickly 
expanded  the  stock  of  motor  vehicles,  reaching  1.05  million 
units  in  1960,  3.1  million  units  in  1970,  and  10.8  million  units 
in  1980. 

Low  electricity  prices  stemmed  from  the  substitution  policy 
and  from  the  attempt  to  control  inflation  by  restraining  the 
increase  in  public-sector  prices  in  nominal  terms.  Thus,  the 
capacity  of  the  electricity  sector  to  generate  resources  for 
investment  was  affected  considerably.  As  a  result  of  federally 


195 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

induced  borrowing  in  die  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  the  sector 
was  also  heavily  indebted.  Intermittent  adjustments  in  electric- 
ity prices  allowed  the  sector  to  generate  profits  and  thus  some 
resources  for  investment.  However,  on  occasion,  the  govern- 
ment returned  to  the  practice  of  manipulating  consumer 
prices  to  contain  inflation. 

Although  the  federal  treasury  initially  assumed  many  of  the 
cost  distortions  of  the  energy  policy,  by  the  end  of  the  1980s 
the  virtual  bankruptcy  of  the  public  sector  precluded  this 
approach.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  government  implemented  a 
series  of  measures  to  reduce  its  role.  It  introduced  deregula- 
tion, market  reforms,  and  privatization,  but  these  reforms  did 
not  change  the  essence  of  the  energy  policy.  Interest  groups 
prevented  the  adoption  of  measures  that  would  drastically  alter 
the  liquid  combustible  policy,  and  the  agency  controlling  elec- 
tric energy  continued  to  lack  resources  for  investments.  Thus, 
the  energy  price  structure  was  altered  only  marginally. 

Low  electricity  prices  induced  a  considerable  substitution  of 
electricity  for  other  sources  of  energy  and  the  expansion  of 
electricity-intensive  production,  such  as  aluminum.  The  heavy 
investments  in  hydroelectricity  of  the  1970s  and  1980s 
matured,  creating  a  considerable  generating  capacity  (50,500 
million  megawatts  or  93.3  percent  of  the  total  generating 
capacity  of  electricity  in  1993).  One  of  the  world's  leading  pro- 
ducers of  hydroelectric  power,  Brazil  has  a  potential  of  106,500 
to  127,868  megawatts,  or,  according  to  the  World  Factbook  1996, 
55,130,000  kilowatts.  The  country's  two  largest  operating 
hydroelectric  power  stations  are  the  12,600-megawatt  Itaipu 
Dam,  the  world's  largest  dam,  on  the  Rio  Parana  in  the  South, 
and  the  Tucurui  Dam  in  Para,  in  the  North  Region  (see  fig.  3). 

In  principle,  an  increase  in  the  generating  capacity  for  elec- 
tricity should  have  been  easy  to  achieve.  Brazil  has  enormous 
hydroelectric  potential,  and  investments  in  the  sector  were 
forthcoming,  although  with  an  initial  delay.  However,  until 
1995  nationalistic  considerations  excluded  foreign  capital  from 
the  electric  energy  sector,  and  regulatory  obstacles  prevented 
domestic  private  investment.  The  federal  and  state  govern- 
ments were  therefore  left  with  the  task  of  expanding  the  gener- 
ating capacity.  As  of  the  early  1990s,  the  government  continued 
to  control  the  sector's  production  end,  as  well  as  transmission 
and  distribution,  although  privatization  of  the  sector  is  under 
consideration.

The  Economy 


Petroleum 

The  fast-growing  requirements  of  petroleum  and  petroleum 
by-products  were  met  initially  by  imports.  However,  foreign- 
exchange  difficulties,  coupled  with  strategic  considerations, 
led  to  efforts  to  reduce  the  country's  dependence  on  imports. 
In  the  early  1950s,  the  government  granted  a  near  monopoly 
of  the  exploration,  production,  refining,  and  transportation  of 
oil  to  the  Brazilian  Petroleum  Corporation  (Petroleo  Brasileiro 
S.A. — Petrobras),  the  state-owned  oil  company,  and  made 
resources  available  for  investments.  Emphasis  was  placed  on 
the  expansion  of  a  domestic  refining  capacity  because  world  oil 
prices  were  low  and  no  problems  were  envisaged  with  oil  sup- 
ply. Thus,  an  important  refining  sector  developed  gradually. 

The  oil  crises  of  the  1970s  placed  Brazil  in  a  vulnerable  situa- 
tion. In  1974  almost  80  percent  of  Brazil's  total  oil  consump- 
tion was  imported,  and  the  increases  in  oil  prices  imposed  a 
substantial  burden  on  the  country's  balance  of  payments.  Con- 
sequently, reducing  dependence  on  imported  energy,  particu- 
larly petroleum,  became  the  main  objective  of  energy  policy. 
This  reduction  was  to  be  achieved  by  large  investments  in 
petroleum  substitutes,  notably  electric  energy  and  ethanol,  and 
by  a  substantial  expansion  in  the  exploration  and  domestic 
production  of  petroleum.  Although  modest  oil  fields  were  not 
discovered  until  late  in  the  1970s,  investments  in  the  energy 
sector  increased  from  around  10  percent  of  total  investment  in 
the  early  1970s  to  a  peak  of  23.5  percent  in  1982-83.  As  a  pro- 
portion of  GDP,  investment  in  energy  increased  steadily,  from 
2.8  percent  early  in  the  1970s,  to  a  peak  of  5.0  percent  in  1982. 

The  government  also  implemented  the  energy  price  policy 
in  reaction  to  the  1979  oil  shock.  The  basic  assumption  was 
that  the  price  of  oil  would  remain  at  its  high  1979  level.  Thus, 
emphasis  on  promoting  substitution  was  absolute.  The  prob- 
lem, however,  was  that  this  emphasis  did  not  change  after  oil 
prices  began  to  decline.  To  encourage  substitution,  the  govern- 
ment set  energy  prices.  The  price  of  gasoline  was  set  at  a  high 
level,  not  only  to  reduce  its  use  but  also  to  finance  Petrobras's 
exploration  effort  and  to  subsidize  other  petroleum  products. 
The  prices  of  diesel  fuel  and  propane  (extensively  used  for 
cooking)  were  maintained  artificially  low,  requiring  subsidies. 
The  low  diesel  price  was  intended  to  keep  transportation  costs 
from  increasing  sharply,  and  social  arguments  were  used  to  jus- 
tify the  propane  subsidy. 


197 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

To  induce  the  purchase  of  ethanol-propelled  cars,  the  price 
of  ethanol  was  maintained  at  60  percent  of  that  of  gasoline.  To 
finance  this  subsidy,  a  mixture  of  20  percent  of  ethanol  in  the 
gasoline  was  established.  The  high  gasoline  prices  exceeded 
the  cost  of  ethanol,  and  the  profits  were  used  to  cover  the  sub- 
sidy. Specially  low  prices  for  electric  energy  were  established  to 
encourage  the  replacement  of  fuel  oil  and  other  oil  derivatives 
in  production. 

The  combination  of  conservation  and  substitution,  along 
with  the  expansion  of  domestic  production,  reduced  the  coun- 
try's dependence  on  imported  crude  oil,  from  around  80  per- 
cent in  the  late  1970s  to  45.6  percent  in  1990.  Domestic  output 
of  crude  oil  increased  from  an  average  165,000  barrels  a  day  in 
1975  to  some  800,100  barrels  a  day  by  1996.  By  the  end  of  1995, 
Brazil's  proven  reserves  had  reached  4.8  billion  barrels  and 
potential  reserves  were  at  8.8  billion  barrels.  About  64  percent 
of  Brazil's  domestic  oil  comes  from  the  continental  shelf  in  the 
Campos  Basin,  which  accounts  for  83  percent  of  proven 
reserves.  The  country's  petroleum  reserves  may  actually  reach 
20  billion  barrels  if  as  yet  unproven  discoveries  in  deep  water 
off  the  Brazilian  coast  are  included. 

Despite  these  advances,  however,  the  rigidity  of  the  energy 
price  policy  brought  about  serious  problems.  The  maintenance 
of  the  gasoline-ethanol  price  differential  and  other  induce- 
ments led  to  a  rapid  increase  in  the  purchase  of  ethanol-pro- 
pelled automobiles  and  to  a  growing  conversion  of  gasoline 
cars  to  ethanol.  Moreover,  the  basic  assumption  that  the  price 
of  oil  would  remain  high  was  incorrect.  Although  world  oil 
prices  declined,  the  price  policy  remained  in  effect  for  ethanol 
producers,  owners  of  ethanol-propelled  cars,  and  the  motor 
vehicle  industry.  Additionally,  the  real  gasoline  price  was 
eroded  gradually  by  the  government's  tendency  to  fight  infla- 
tion by  tampering  with  the  prices  of  goods  and  services  pro- 
duced by  the  public  sector.  Also,  the  substitution  of  ethanol  for 
gasoline  caused  a  swift  reduction  in  the  sale  of  gasoline  in  the 
domestic  market.  Consequently,  the  profits  Petrobras  obtained 
initially  from  gasoline  dwindled  quickly,  and  the  company 
required  assistance  from  the  treasury  for  its  exploration  pro- 
gram and  to  cover  various  subsidies.  The  sharp  increase  in  the 
use  of  diesel  fuel  for  transportation,  created  by  this  fuel's  sub- 
sidy, together  with  technical  rigidities  in  refining,  forced  Petro- 
bras to  produce  much  more  gasoline  than  was  required  by  the 
domestic  market.  This  excess  had  to  be  sold  abroad,  often  at

below-cost  prices.  Because  the  demand  for  diesel  fuel  contin- 
ued to  grow  and  the  demand  for  gasoline  to  shrink,  Petrobras 
was  forced  to  invest  heavily  in  changing  the  product  profile  of 
its  refineries.  In  the  early  1990s,  the  government  reduced  the 
gasoline-ethanol  price  differential  (in  1993  the  price  of  etha- 
nol  was  78.4  percent  of  that  of  gasoline).  The  price  of  gasoline 
was  maintained  sufficiently  high  to  prevent  massive  subsidies  to 
ethanol.  The  prices  of  diesel  fuel  and  propane  were  increased. 

Natural  Gas 

Brazil  meets  only  2  percent  of  its  energy  needs  with  natural 
gas,  but  the  country's  natural  gas  consumption  is  likely  to 
increase  greatly.  In  May  1992,  the  state  oil  companies  of  Brazil 
and  Bolivia  signed  an  agreement  outlining  the  route  for  a 
2,270-kilometer,  US$2  billion  pipeline  system  to  deliver  natural 
gas  from  Bolivian  fields  to  Brazil's  Southeast.  The  pipeline  was 
scheduled  to  begin  supplying  8  million  cubic  meters  a  day  of 
Bolivian  gas  in  1997,  building  up  to  16  million  cubic  meters  a 
day  by  2004. 

Nuclear  Power 

Nuclear  energy  provides  an  interesting  chapter  in  Brazil's 
energy  policy.  In  the  early  1970s,  nuclear  energy  was  consid- 
ered to  have  great  potential,  but  it  failed  to  develop.  In  1975 
Brazil  signed  an  agreement  with  the  Federal  Republic  of  Ger- 
many (West  Germany)  under  which  that  country  would  supply 
eight  nuclear  power  reactors  and  transfer  technology  for  the 
complete  nuclear  fuel  cycle.  A  small  nuclear  power  plant — the 
Angra  I,  which  has  a  626-megawatt  capacity — was  built  near  Rio 
de  Janeiro,  and  work  was  programmed  to  start  on  two  larger 
facilities  on  the  same  site  (the  Angra  II  and  III  units,  which 
were  to  have  a  combined  capacity  of  3.1  million  kilowatts). 

The  Angra  I  plant,  which  has  a  reactor  supplied  by  Westing- 
house  Electric  Corporation,  was  completed  and  trial  runs  were 
made  in  1982,  but  reactor  defects  delayed  operations  until 
1983.  Moreover,  technical  problems  allowed  the  facility  to  func- 
tion only  intermittently.  Regarding  the  Angra  II  and  III  plants, 
construction  was  started  on  the  first.  However,  the  fiscal  crisis,  a 
slower  than  anticipated  growth  in  the  demand  for  electricity  in 
the  1980s,  the  adverse  United  States  reaction  to  the  Brazil-West 
Germany  agreement,  and  a  growing  environmental  militancy 
in  Brazil  led  to  slowdowns  in  construction. 


200 


The  Economy 


In  1985  the  agreement  with  West  Germany  was  revised,  and 
the  construction  of  the  other  reactors  was  postponed  indefi- 
nitely, in  part  for  financial  reasons.  Moreover,  growing  fiscal 
difficulties  led  to  an  interruption  of  construction  on  Angra  II 
and  further  postponement  of  Angra  III.  In  1988  it  was  esti- 
mated that  the  completion  of  the  two  plants  would  require 
US$2.8  billion,  which  was  not  available.  In  the  early  1990s, 
there  were  no  indications  of  when  the  two  facilities  would  be 
completed.  Despite  the  delays,  the  technology  transfer  clauses 
of  the  agreement  have  been  maintained,  and  Brazil  has  contin- 
ued to  receive  West  German  nuclear  technology. 

In  1990  Brazil's  uranium  reserves  were  estimated  at  301,500 
tons,  or  the  equivalent  of  2.1  billion  tons  of  petroleum.  A  yel- 
low-cake (see  Glossary)  factory  and  a  plant  to  produce  nuclear 
fuel  elements  have  been  completed,  and  additional  processing 
facilities  are  under  construction  or  planned.  These  will  allow 
for  the  enrichment  of  uranium  and  the  reprocessing  of  spent 
fuel.  However,  as  was  the  case  with  the  power  reactors,  lack  of 
resources  has  slowed  down  developments  in  this  area.  In  early 
1997,  the  Brazilian  nuclear  energy  program  was  being  supplied 
by  the  only  uranium  mine  operating  in  Brazil,  in  Pocos  de  Cal- 
das,  Minas  Gerais  State.  That  mine  is  being  deactivated  and 
replaced  by  the  Lagoa  Real/Caetite  Mine  in  the  Caetite  District 
in  southwestern  Bahia  State  (see  Nuclear  Programs,  ch.  6). 

The  Services  Sector 

In  1950  Brazil's  services  sector  was  still  small  and,  except  for 
certain  segments  associated  with  international  trade,  quite 
undeveloped.  With  industrialization,  the  sector  expanded  and 
underwent  considerable  changes.  By  the  early  1990s,  it  had 
developed  an  important  modern  segment,  mainly  composed  of 
parts  of  the  subsectors  of  commerce,  transportation,  communi- 
cations, finance,  and  professional  services.  However,  other  sub- 
sectors,  especially  education  and  public  administration,  failed 
to  develop  adequately. 

Moreover,  an  informal  economy,  a  large  portion  of  which 
was  in  the  services  sector,  expanded  as  a  result  of  poverty,  the 
rapid  rise  in  population,  the  inadequate  provision  of  educa- 
tion, and  the  succession  of  economic  troubles  since  1980.  This 
expansion  can  be  seen  by  examining  the  services  sector's  share 
of  GDP  and  employment  over  time.  Between  1950  and  1980, 
the  services  sector  generated  around  50  percent  of  the  coun- 
try's GDP;  by  1993  the  share  had  increased  to  at  least  41  per- 


201 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

cent  but  possibly  as  high  as  55.9  percent,  in  part  because  of 
industry's  poor  performance  but  also  because  of  the  informal 
sector's  expansion.  The  share  of  the  services  sector  in  the 
absorption  of  manpower  is  also  evidence  of  the  recent  growth 
of  the  informal  sector.  In  1950  the  services  sector  employed 
only  22.5  percent  of  the  total  economically  active  population 
(see  Glossary);  this  proportion  rose  to  33.3  percent  in  1970,  to 
40.8  percent  in  1980,  and,  in  a  sharp  rise,  to  57.4  percent  in 
1992. 

Transportation 

Before  the  1930s,  roads  and  railroads  primarily  linked  pro- 
duction centers  to  seaports,  and  there  were  some  connections 
among  major  urban  centers.  Rail  links  to  the  rest  of  South 
America  were  never  developed  in  any  measure  comparable 
with  those  among  European  countries,  or  between  the  United 
States  and  Canada.  Adequate  international  road  links  with 
neighboring  countries  existed  only  with  Brazil's  southern 
neighbors — Argentina,  Uruguay,  and  Paraguay.  By  the  1980s,  a 
start  had  been  made  on  a  national  road  system  connecting  the 
various  parts  of  the  country.  However,  construction  and  main- 
tenance costs  were  high,  slowing  extensions  to  the  system  as 
well  as  the  addition  of  feeder  roads.  In  a  country  as  large  as 
Brazil,  with  its  difficult  terrain,  a  developed  transportation  sys- 
tem remains  many  years  off  (see  fig.  10). 

Highways 

By  1992  Brazil's  national  highway  network  totaled  1,670,148 
kilometers.  Paved  highway  totals  161,503  kilometers;  1,508,645 
kilometers  are  gravel  or  earth.  Paved  roads  link  the  capital, 
Brasilia,  with  every  region  of  Brazil.  Roads  are  the  principal 
mode  of  transport,  accounting  for  60  percent  of  freight  and  95 
percent  of  passenger  traffic,  including  long-distance  bus  ser- 
vice. Major  projects  include  the  5,000-kilometer  Trans-Amazo- 
nian Highway,  running  from  Recife  and  Cabedelo  to  the 
Peruvian  border;  the  4,138-kilometer  north-south  Cuiba-San- 
tarem  Highway;  and  the  3,555-kilometer  Trans-Brasiliana 
Project,  which  will  link  Maraba,  on  the  Trans-Amazonian  High- 
way, with  Acegua,  on  the  Uruguayan  border. 

Railroads 

Railroads  total  at  least  30,129  kilometers,  of  which  24,690 
kilometers  consist  of  1.000-meter  gauge,  5,120  kilometers  con-

sist  of  1.600-meter  gauge,  310  kilometers  consist  of  mixed 
1.600-  to  1.000-meter  gauge,  13  kilometers  consist  of  0.760- 
meter  gauge,  and  2,150  kilometers  are  electrified.  Rail  projects 
from  mining  areas  to  ports  have  accounted  for  the  bulk  of 
investment  in  the  railroads  since  the  mid-1980s.  Mining  compa- 
nies operate  several  privately  owned  railroads.  In  1987  the  gov- 
ernment announced  controversial  plans  to  build  a  1,600- 
kilometer  north-south  railroad  to  link  the  city  of  Acailandia,  in 
Maranhao  State,  with  Brasilia.  The  Federal  Railroad  System, 
Inc.  (Rede  Ferroviaria  Federal  S.A. — RFFSA)  is  responsible  for 
suburban  networks  throughout  Brazil.  By  1994  the  government 
had  approved  plans  to  privatize  RFFSA.  A  new  railroad  running 
westward  from  Santos  through  agricultural  lands,  then  north 
reaching  near  the  Amazon's  southwestern  margin,  is  being 
built  by  a  private  entrepreneur's  railroad  company,  Ferronorte. 

Subways 

Recife,  Rio  de  Janeiro,  and  Sao  Paulo  have  new  urban  sub- 
way systems.  Sao  Paulo's  Metro,  the  first  in  Brazil,  began  operat- 
ing in  1975.  It  is  clean,  safe,  cheap,  and  efficient.  It  has  two 
main  lines  intersecting  at  Praca  de  Se.  One  runs  north-south 
from  San  tana  to  Jabaquara.  Another  runs  east-west  from  Corin- 
thians Itaquera  to  Barra  Funda.  A  third  line  runs  from  Clinicas 
in  the  west,  along  Avenida  Paulista,  to  Ana  Rosa  in  the  south, 
joining  the  Jabaquara  line  at  Paraiso  and  Ana  Rosa. 

Rio  de  Janeiro  also  has  a  good,  clean,  and  fast  Metro  service. 
The  nineteen-kilometer  Line  One  operates  between  Tijuca  and 
Botafogo,  via  the  railway  station  and  Gloria.  It  is  being 
extended  one  kilometer  at  the  Tijuca  end  and  seven  kilometers 
on  the  new  South  Line  from  Botafogo  to  Ipanema  and  Leblon 
(Jardim  do  Allah)  via  Copacabana.  Line  Two  runs  past  the 
Maracana  Stadium  northward  to  Iraja  and  eventually  will  oper- 
ate form  Praca  15  de  Novembro  through  the  city  center  to  Esta- 
cio. 

Airports 

Air  travel  is  very  important  for  a  country  the  size  of  Brazil.  It 
has  3,581  airports,  3,024  of  which  are  usable.  The  airports 
include  436  with  permanent-surface  runways,  two  with  runways 
more  than  3,659  meters  long,  twenty-two  with  runways  2,440  to 
3,659  meters,  and  598  with  runways  1,220  to  2,439  meters.  Prin- 
cipal international  airports  include  the  Campo  Grande  Air-

port,  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  Airport,  the  Guarulhos  Airport  in  Sao 
Paulo,  and  the  Guararapes  Airport  in  Recife. 

Ports 

Brazil  has  thirty-six  deep-water  ports.  The  largest  ones  are 
Belem,  Fortaleza,  Ilheus,  Imbituba,  Manaus,  Paranagua,  Porto 
Alegre,  Recife,  Rio  de  Janeiro,  Rio  Grande,  Salvador,  Santos, 
and  Vitoria.  With  the  possible  exception  of  Argentina  and  Uru- 
guay, ocean-shipping  arrangements  are  easier  to  the  United 
States  and  Europe  than  to  the  rest  of  Latin  America.  In  January 
1993,  the  Brazilian  Congress  approved  legislation  that  could 
allow  for  the  privatization  of  the  nation's  ports.  Brazil's  major 
port,  in  terms  of  the  value  of  exports  and  imports,  has  long 
been  Santos,  Sao  Paulo  State,  followed  by  the  ports  of  Rio  de 
Janeiro  and  Vitoria.  Although  all  three  ports  handle  some 
trade  with  other  Latin  American  countries,  they  traditionally 
have  handled  more  trade  with  Europe  and  the  United  States, 
and  the  Japanese  presence  has  been  increasing.  Santos  is  Latin 
America's  largest  port.  Located  seventy-two  kilometers  south  of 
Sao  Paulo,  it  handles  a  daily  average  of  50,000  tons  cargo.  In 
1994  Santos  handled  its  largest  volume  of  cargo  since  it  first 
started  operations  in  1892.  A  total  of  3,960  ships  with  31.4  mil- 
lion tons  of  cargo  passed  through  the  port  in  1994. 

Inland  Waterways 

River  transport  accounts  for  only  a  minor  part  of  the  move- 
ment of  goods.  In  1988  total  freight  carried  was  7.7  million 
tons,  as  compared  with  4.7  million  tons  in  1980.  Brazil  has 
50,000  kilometers  of  inland  waterways.  The  three  major  river 
systems  are  the  Amazon,  the  Parana,  and  the  Sao  Francisco. 
The  Amazon  is  navigable  for  3,680  kilometers  to  Iquitos,  Peru. 
Oceangoing  ships  can  reach  as  far  as  Manaus,  1,600  kilometers 
upstream.  There  are  plans  to  link  the  Amazon  and  Upper 
Parana.  In  addition,  a  3,442-kilometer  waterway  system  is  being 
created  by  extending  the  Tiete-Parana  river  network  along  the 
Paraguai  and  Parana  rivers  as  far  as  Buenos  Aires. 

Merchant  Marine 

The  merchant  marine,  the  largest  in  Latin  America,  has  220 
ships  totaling  5,139,176  gross  ton  weight  (GTW)  and  8,695,682 
deadweight  tons  (DWT).  It  has  five  passenger-cargo,  forty 
cargo,  one  refrigerator  cargo,  twelve  combination  ore/oil, 
sixty-five  bulk,  two  combination  bulk,  and  eleven  vehicle  car-

rier  ships.  In  addition,  one  naval  tanker  is  sometimes  used 
commercially. 

Telecommunications 

Brazil  has  a  good  system  of  telecommunications,  including 
extensive  microwave  radio-relay  facilities.  In  1995  the  country 
had  13,237,852  telephones.  It  has  as  many  as  3,171  broadcast 
stations.  These  include  1,265  FM,  1,572  medium-wave,  and 
eighty-two  tropical-wave  radio  stations  and  257  television  sta- 
tions. 

In  1995  the  Roman  Catholic  Church  organized  a  UHF  satel- 
lite television  channel  broadcasting  to  eight  states  under  the 
aegis  of  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Christian  Communication. 
The  Brazilian  government  founded  the  Brazilian  Radio  Broad- 
casting Company  (Empresa  Brasileira  de  Radiodifusao — Radio- 
bras)  in  1975  to  unite  all  existing  state-owned  broadcasting 
stations  and  to  create  new  radio  and  television  services  capable 
of  reaching  the  Amazon  region. 

Until  the  1988  constitution,  the  president  had  the  exclusive 
prerogative  to  allocate  radio  and  television  concessions.  In 
1981,  after  canceling  the  Tupi  Network  concessions,  the  mili- 
tary government  very  capriciously  selected  political  allies  to  set 
up  new  networks — Manchete,  Bandeirantes,  and  the  Brazilian 
Television  System  (Sistema  Brasileiro  de  Televisao — SBT)  — 
and  passed  over  other  communications  enterprises  (the  news- 
paper Jornal  do  Brasil  and  the  publisher  Editora  Abril,  for  exam- 
ple). From  1985  through  1988,  television  and  radio  con- 
cessions became  the  "currency  of  political  negotiation"  as  Pres- 
ident Sarney  tried  to  maintain  majorities  in  Congress.  As  a 
result,  many  evangelical  (born-again  Christian)  organizations 
acquired  radio  and  television  concessions,  much  to  the  dissatis- 
faction of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church. 

In  1988  Radiobras  and  the  official  Brazilian  News  Agency 
became  a  single  organization  under  the  name  Brazilian  Com- 
munications Company  (Empresa  Brasileira  de  Comunicacao), 
which  retained  the  Radiobras  acronym.  Today,  Radiobras  sta- 
tions can  be  heard  all  over  the  country  and  abroad.  Its  televi- 
sion programs  also  are  transmitted  throughout  the  country  by 
Brazil  Network  (Rede  Brasil).  Brazil  has  six  principal  television 
networks:  Globo  (owned  by  Roberto  Marinho),  Manchete 
(Adolfo  Bloch),  Bandeirantes  (Joao  Jorge  Saad),  the  SBT 
(Silvio  Santos),  Record  (pentecostal  Bishop  Edir  Macedo),  and 
TV-Gaucha  S.A.  There  is  also  an  embryonic  system  of  pay  tele-

vision  (cable,  microwave,  and  satellite).  Brazil  is  connected 
internationally  by  three  coaxial  submarine  cables,  three  Atlan- 
tic Ocean  International  Telecommunications  Satellite  Organi- 
zation (Intelsat)  earth  stations,  and  sixty-four  domestic  satellite 
earth  stations. 

Brazilian  Telecommunications,  Inc.  (Telecomunicacoes 
Brasileiras  S.A. — Telebras),  a  state-owned  company  with 
monopoly  control  over  Brazilian  telecommunications,  oversees 
Brazil's  telecommunications.  According  to  Telebras,  the  Brazil- 
ian government  is  developing  an  indigenous  cellular  tele- 
phone project,  called  Eco-8,  which  by  1998  is  supposed  to 
enable  telephone  contact  between  anywhere  in  Brazil  and 
some  Central  American  countries.  A  1995  constitutional 
reform  proposal  allowed  for  the  privatization  of  Telebras. 

Brazil  leads  Latin  America  with  at  least  161  Internet  net- 
works; second-place  Mexico  has  105  networks.  Almost  80  per- 
cent of  Brazil's  largest  nongovernmental  organizations  (NGOs) 
are  connected  with  each  other  and  with  the  Internet.  Accord- 
ing to  the  Brazilian  Telecommunications  Company  (Empresa 
Brasileira  de  Telecomunicacoes — Embratel),  in  early  1995  the 
Internet  became  available  to  any  Brazilian  with  access  to  a  tele- 
phone and  a  modem.  Until  then,  the  Internet  had  been  avail- 
able only  to  researchers  linked  to  educational  institutions  or 
NGOs. 

Tourism 

Brazil's  natural  wonders  include  the  Amazon;  the  wildlife- 
packed  Pantanal  wetlands;  8,850  kilometers  of  superb  Atlantic 
coastline,  including  3,200  kilometers  of  white  sand  beaches  in 
the  Northeast  running  from  Sao  Luis  in  the  north  to  the  Bahia 
Basin  in  the  south;  and  the  waterfalls  at  Foz  do  Iguacu.  Brazil 
has  one  of  the  world's  most  spectacularly  located  cities,  Rio  de 
Janeiro,  which  hosts  the  annual  Mardi  Gras  Carnaval  (Carni- 
val) ;  one  of  the  largest  cities,  Sao  Paulo;  one  of  the  most  mod- 
ernistic, Brasilia;  and  one  of  the  most  ecologically  advanced, 
Curitiba.  Other  popular  cities  include  Salvador,  Ouro  Preto, 
and  Manaus. 

Traditionally,  Brazilian  politicians  have  regarded  travel  and 
tourism  as  elitist  and  an  unnecessary  luxury.  This  view  has  been 
changing,  however,  as  politicians  have  begun  to  see  travel  and 
tourism  as  a  major  industry.  In  the  early  1990s,  about  6  million 
jobs  were  linked  to  Brazil's  travel  and  tourism  industry.  The 
industry  is  one  of  the  country's  biggest  employers,  involving 


208 


The  Economy 


one  in  every  eleven  workers.  It  contributes  an  estimated  8  per- 
cent to  the  country's  GDP.  This  figure  compares  favorably  with 
Latin  America's  average  of  5.1  percent,  but  it  is  well  below  the 
world  average  of  10.2  percent. 

Since  the  United  Nations-sponsored  Rio  Earth  Summit 
(Eco-92)  in  1992,  the  Brazilian  government  has  targeted  ecot- 
ourism  as  a  priority.  For  example,  the  government  is  encourag- 
ing foreign  investment  in  tourist  facilities  in  Amazonia.  The 
Ministry  of  Commerce,  Industry,  and  Tourism  includes  a  cabi- 
net-level official  in  charge  of  tourism  policies.  The  National 
Secretary  of  Tourism  and  Services,  the  National  Tourism 
Board,  and  the  state  and  municipal  tourist  authorities  are 
responsible  for  the  day-to-day  administration  of  the  sector. 

The  development  of  tourism  in  the  seven  states  that  make 
up  the  impoverished  Northeast  has  received  special  attention. 
More  than  3  million  Brazilian  and  foreign  visitors  boosted 
hotel  occupancy  in  the  Northeastern  states  from  43  percent  in 
1991  to  67  percent  in  1993. 

In  1992  some  2,235,000  passengers  flew  to  Brazil,  an 
increase  of  14.5  percent  from  1991,  and  the  same  number  flew 
out  of  Brazil.  About  513,000  of  these  visitors  flew  between 
Argentina  and  Brazil,  and  according  to  Brazil's  Civil  Aviation 
Department  (Departamento  de  Aviacao  Civil — DAC),  more 
than  541,000  passengers  flew  between  the  United  States  and 
Brazil,  an  increase  of  10.4  percent  from  1991.  The  Brazilian 
Tourism  Agency  (Empresa  Brasileira  de  Turismo — Embratur) 
found  that  72.6  percent  of  those  who  came  to  Brazil  in  1992 
came  for  tourism;  the  rest  came  for  business,  conferences,  and 
conventions,  including  Eco-92.  In  1993  about  1.6  million  for- 
eign visitors  traveled  to  Brazil. 

Privatization 

The  rise  in  interest  in  the  privatization  of  state-owned  enter- 
prises in  Brazil  that  began  in  the  1980s  reflects  similar  trends 
worldwide.  Although  much  of  the  rhetoric  used  by  the  advo- 
cates of  privatization  emphasized  economic  efficiency  and 
competitiveness,  much  of  Brazil's  privatization  experience 
since  1990  is  better  understood  as  a  response  to  the  fiscal  pres- 
sures on  the  public  sector,  which  worsened  significantly  in  the 
1980s. 

The  sale  of  state  enterprises  to  private  buyers,  both  domestic 
and  foreign,  offered  an  attractive  means  to  reduce  the  fiscal 
pressures.  First,  the  sale  of  an  enterprise  provided  an  immedi-

ate  revenue  gain  for  the  government.  Second,  to  the  extent 
that  the  enterprise  sold  was  operating  at  a  loss,  the  future  fiscal 
burden  on  the  public  sector  was  reduced.  Finally,  the  conver- 
sion of  a  state  enterprise  into  a  profitable  private  one  increased 
the  future  tax  revenues  of  the  government. 

Implicit  in  these  motives  for  privatization  is  a  difficult  choice 
for  the  government.  The  first  reason  suggests  that  the  greatest 
immediate  revenue  effect  would  be  obtained  from  the  sale  of 
the  most  profitable  firms,  such  as  the  CVRD  (Rio  Doce  Valley 
Company),  Brazil's  iron  mining  and  exploring  complex.  The 
second  consideration,  however,  suggests  that  long-term  reve- 
nue benefits  would  be  more  likely  from  the  sale  of  enterprises 
that  have  had  a  long  history  of  low  or  negative  returns,  such  as 
the  RFFSA  (Federal  Railroad  System,  Inc.).  Brazilian  privatiza- 
tion experience  and  policies  since  the  1980s  reflects  the  diffi- 
culty of  deciding  which  firms  to  privatize  first. 

Although  some  privatization  occurred  between  1980  and 
1990,  it  was  confined  to  cases  in  which  the  federal  government 
had  taken  over  firms  in  financial  difficulties,  and  did  not  touch 
any  of  the  major  state-owned  enterprises  that  had  been  estab- 
lished purposely  by  the  federal  government  and  by  some  state 
governments  in  the  preceding  three  decades.  In  all,  only  thirty- 
eight  enterprises  were  privatized  by  the  federal  government 
before  1990,  and  the  total  receipts  of  the  government  were 
only  US$723  million. 

Policy  changed  significantly  with  the  entrance  of  the  Collor 
government  in  1990,  which  made  privatization  one  of  the 
major  planks  of  its  economic  platform.  The  National  Privatiza- 
tion Program  (Programa  Nacional  de  Desestatizacao — PND), 
which  was  created  by  the  National  Economic  Development 
Bank  (Banco  Nacional  de  Desenvolvimento  Economico — 
BNDE),  expanded  the  scope  of  privatization  to  include  a  num- 
ber of  the  enterprises  formerly  considered  as  "strategic"  by  ear- 
lier governments.  During  the  Collor  government  between  1990 
and  1992,  fifteen  state-owned  enterprises  were  privatized,  yield- 
ing about  US$3.5  billion  in  total  proceeds.  The  most  important 
sale  was  that  of  the  Minas  Gerais  Iron  and  Steel  Mills,  Inc.  (Usi- 
nas  Siderurgicas  de  Minas  Gerais  S.A. — Usiminas)  steel  com- 
pany in  October  1991,  which  alone  accounted  for  nearly  twice 
the  revenue  of  all  previous  privatizations  and  sold  for  US$2.3 
billion.  The  Japanese  holding  company  Nippon  Usiminas 
acquired  about  18  percent  of  the  shares.  During  this  period, 
most  sales  were  exchanges  of  equity  in  state-owned  enterprises 


212 


The  Economy 


for  different  types  of  public  debt  or  "soft  money,"  rather  than 
for  cash. 

Under  the  Franco  government  (1992-94),  privatization  con- 
tinued but  with  a  greater  emphasis  on  sales  for  cash.  Eighteen 
state-owned  enterprises  were  sold,  yielding  over  US$5  billion. 
Among  the  most  important  enterprises  sold  in  this  period  was 
the  Brazilian  Aeronautics  Company  (Empresa  Brasileira 
Aeronautica — Embraer),  an  aircraft  manufacturer,  which  had 
been  established  in  1969  and  controlled  by  the  Ministry  of 
Aeronautics.  By  1994  only  twenty-five  state-owned  enterprises 
had  been  sold,  mostly  in  exchange  for  debt  certificates  and  lit- 
tle hard  cash.  Other  enterprises  included  several  chemical,  fer- 
tilizer, and  mining  companies,  with  the  steel  sector  wholly 
privatized  by  the  end  of  1994. 

Privatization  policy  under  the  Cardoso  administration, 
beginning  in  1995,  shifted  focus  to  state-owned  enterprises 
responsible  for  the  major  part  of  Brazil's  economic  infrastruc- 
ture, among  them  enterprises  in  the  energy,  transportation, 
and  communications  sectors.  The  first  major  privatization  was 
the  sale  of  the  Espirito  Santo  Power  Plants,  Inc.  (Espfrito  Santo 
Centrais  Eletricas  S.A.— Escelsa),  the  federally  owned  power 
company  serving  the  state  of  Espirito  Santo,  in  July  1995.  In  a 
departure  from  earlier  policy,  the  CVRD,  one  of  Brazil's  largest 
state  enterprises,  was  included  in  the  program  by  the  new  gov- 
ernment. Although  Brazil's  largest  state-owned  enterprises, 
Petrobras,  remained  outside  the  program  because  of  constitu- 
tional restrictions,  appraisals  were  begun  of  the  RFFSA  and  of 
the  remaining  federally  owned  power  companies. 

Exchange-Rate  and  Balance  of  Payments  Policies 

Many  of  Brazil's  economic  difficulties  since  the  1970s  have 
been  blamed  on  external  economic  shocks.  Brazil's  heavy 
dependence  on  imported  petroleum  and  on  capital  inflows 
from  other  countries  made  it  highly  vulnerable  to  sharp  rises  in 
oil  prices  and  to  increases  in  interest  rates.  Even  when  prices 
and  interest  rates  declined  in  the  late  1980s  from  their  earlier 
peaks,  Brazil's  economic  problems  persisted.  Brazil  was  surpris- 
ingly successful  in  adjusting  its  external  payments  after  the  for- 
eign debt  crisis,  which  began  with  the  Mexican  default  in 
August  1982.  However,  Brazil  paid  a  heavy  domestic  price  for 
external  adjustment.  Short-term  measures  to  alleviate  the  bal- 
ance of  payments,  moreover,  delayed  long-term  moves  toward  a 
more  open  and  efficient  economy.

Exchange  Rates  and  Foreign  Trade 

The  single  most  important  policy  tool  for  influencing  Bra- 
zil's balance  of  payments  is  the  exchange  rate.  Brazilian 
exchange-rate  policy  has  evolved  over  the  past  several  decades. 
Policy  makers  and  Brazilian  exporters  believed  that  trade  flows 
in  the  1960s  and  1970s  were  most  effectively  managed  through 
trade  policies  such  as  tariffs  (see  Glossary),  import  controls,  or 
export  incentives.  Beginning  in  the  1980s,  they  began  to  recog- 
nize that  balance  of  payments  adjustments  may  be  more  effi- 
ciently pursued  using  the  exchange  rate,  rather  than  tariffs, 
subsidies,  and  direct  controls  on  trade.  This  evolution  in  think- 
ing reflects  in  part  the  increasing  skepticism  among  many  Bra- 
zilians, both  economists  and  policy  makers,  about  the 
government's  ability  to  maintain  external  balance  using  trade 
policy  without  creating  severe  economic  distortions. 

Even  more  important,  however,  was  the  exchange-rate  expe- 
rience of  the  early  1980s.  Following  the  onset  of  Mexico's  debt 
crisis  in  1982  and  the  resulting  inability  of  Brazil  to  continue  to 
finance  its  current-account  deficit  through  external  borrowing, 
the  cruzeiro  was  devalued  sharply  against  the  dollar  in  Febru- 
ary 1983.  Unlike  the  earlier  "maxidevaluation"  of  December 
1979,  which  was  soon  undermined  by  rapid  increases  in  inter- 
nal cruzeiro  prices,  the  real  depreciation  of  the  cruzeiro  result- 
ing from  the  1983  adjustment  was  maintained  for  the  next 
several  years.  Exports  increased  substantially  in  1983  and  1984, 
and  the  value  of  imports  fell  by  over  US$5  billion  between  1982 
and  1984.  Although  some  of  this  decline  resulted  from  the  fall 
in  petroleum  prices  from  their  record  levels  in  1981,  the 
response  of  the  trade  deficit  to  the  large  and  sustained  real 
depreciation  of  the  cruzeiro  provided  clear  evidence  that  Bra- 
zil's external  adjustment  problem  could  be  addressed  through 
exchange-rate  policy.  The  experience  of  the  early  1980s,  in 
fact,  led  to  the  recognition  that  Brazil's  real  problem  was  not 
the  private  sector's  lack  of  response  to  the  exchange  rate,  but 
the  inability  of  the  domestic  economy,  particularly  the  public 
sector,  to  generate  the  net  saving  that  is  the  counterpart  of  a 
current-account  surplus. 

Brazil's  success  in  moving  the  current  account  into  surplus 
after  1982  implied  a  corresponding  adjustment  in  either  net 
private  saving  (private  saving  minus  private  investment)  or  in 
public-sector  saving  (tax  receipts  and  other  public  revenues 
minus  public  expenditures).  Because  net  public-sector  saving 
actually  deteriorated  in  the  1980s,  the  burden  of  adjustment 


214 


The  Economy 


fell  on  the  private  sector,  particularly  on  investment.  The  dra- 
matic fall  in  investment  after  1982  had  important  conse- 
quences for  Brazilian  competitiveness  and  hence  for  the 
potential  benefits  that  Brazil  would  derive  from  trade  reform. 

Thus,  the  experience  of  the  early  1980s  suggests  that  the 
Brazilian  economy  had  responded  to  real  exchange  rates  (see 
Glossary)  that  facilitated  external  adjustment,  but  the  policy 
also  reduced  domestic  private  investment  and  future  economic 
growth.  In  retrospect,  the  delay  among  policy  makers  in  using 
the  exchange  rate  as  the  primary  tool  for  achieving  external 
balance  is  surprising.  Their  approach  may  have  been  influ- 
enced in  part,  however,  by  the  success  of  the  "crawling-peg" 
policy  instituted  in  August  1968.  This  policy  consisted  of  small 
but  frequent  adjustments  in  the  nominal  exchange  rate  in  line 
with  Brazilian  inflation  and  price  changes  in  Brazil's  major 
trade  partners,  primarily  the  United  States.  It  ushered  in  a  long 
period  of  real  exchange-rate  stability,  broken  only  a  decade 
later  by  the  December  1979  devaluation.  The  crawling-peg  pol- 
icy was  a  marked  improvement  over  the  earlier  exchange-rate 
regime,  in  which  the  combination  of  domestic  inflation  and  a 
nominal  exchange  rate  fixed  for  long  periods  of  time  resulted 
in  large  fluctuations  and  uncertainty  about  the  real  exchange 
rate.  The  real  rate  may  in  fact  have  been  too  stable,  however, 
leading  Brazil  to  delay  the  appropriate  exchange-rate  response 
to  the  external  shocks  of  the  1970s. 

A  rise  in  the  real  exchange  rate  represents  an  increase  in 
Brazilian  price  competitiveness  in  international  markets.  Such 
an  increase  in  price  competitiveness  could  be  caused  by  a 
depreciation  of  the  cruzeiro  against  the  dollar,  a  rise  in  United 
States  prices,  or  a  fall  in  Brazilian  prices.  A  slowing  of  inflation 
in  the  1970s  made  Brazil  more  competitive,  while  the  rapid 
acceleration  of  inflation  in  the  second  half  of  the  1980s  sub- 
stantially eroded  Brazil's  price  competitiveness.  Unlike  other 
episodes  in  which  the  actual  effects  of  a  devaluation  were  rap- 
idly undercut  by  Brazilian  inflation,  the  1983  real  devaluation 
was  maintained  through  frequent  adjustments  in  the  nominal 
exchange  rate,  sufficient  to  maintain  Brazil's  price  competitive- 
ness in  international  markets  until  the  1986  Cruzado  Plan 
froze  the  nominal  exchange  rate  (see  fig.  11;  table  12,  Appen- 
dix). 

A  number  of  implications  for  Brazil's  balance  of  payments 
policy  are  clear  from  exchange-rate  trends  and  movements  in 
the  current  account.  First,  by  the  1980s  it  was  clear  that  Brazil-

ian  trade  flows  were  strongly  responsive  to  the  real  exchange 
rate.  If  "elasticity  pessimism,"  which  hypothesizes  that  trade 
responses  to  relative  prices  are  low,  was  ever  justified  in  the  Bra- 
zilian case,  those  days  were  long  past.  Since  the  late  1960s,  Bra- 
zil has  ceased  to  be  a  developing  country  in  terms  of  its  trade 
flows.  Traditional  primary  products,  such  as  coffee,  cocoa,  or 
sugar,  in  recent  years  have  accounted  for  less  than  a  third  of 
the  value  of  Brazilian  exports.  The  increasing  importance  of 
manufactured  exports,  as  well  as  the  variety  of  local  import  sub- 
stitutes, makes  Brazil's  trade  balance  responsive  to  real 


216 


The  Economy 


exchange-rate  changes.  This  responsiveness  removes  one  of  the 
traditional  justifications  for  extensive  tariff  and  import  restric- 
tion policies  and  for  administrative  intervention  in  trade  to 
attain  external  balance.  The  evidence  of  the  past  several 
decades  suggests  that  Brazil  can  attain  external  balance  without 
extensive  market  intervention,  however  harsh  the  domestic 
effects  of  external  adjustment. 

Second,  the  introduction  of  a  degree  of  indexation  of  the 
nominal  exchange  rate  in  the  form  of  the  crawling-peg  policy 
has  permitted  the  external  sector  to  avoid  some  of  the  conse- 
quences of  domestic  inflation  that  would  otherwise  have  pro- 
duced much  more  severe  external  payments  crises.  Real 
exchange  rates  remained  relatively  stable  for  a  decade  after  the 
policy's  introduction  in  1968.  Unlike  several  other  Latin  Ameri- 
can countries  such  as  Argentina,  Brazil  avoided  the  sharp 
swings  in  the  real  exchange  rate  resulting  from  domestic  infla- 
tion and  infrequent  adjustment  of  the  nominal  rate.  When  Bra- 
zil departed  from  this  pattern,  as  it  did  in  1986  during  the 
Cruzado  Plan,  policy  makers  soon  learned  that  this  was  a  mis- 
take. Subsequent  stabilization  plans,  even  if  they  were  failures 
for  other  reasons,  at  least  did  not  succumb  to  the  temptation  to 
use  the  exchange  rate  as  an  anti-inflationary  weapon. 

Finally,  and  perhaps  more  negatively,  Brazilian  exchange- 
rate  policy  transformed  Brazil's  external  adjustment  problems 
of  the  early  1980s  into  more  intractable  domestic  balance  prob- 
lems in  the  early  1990s.  Contrary  to  the  initial  expectations  of 
many  observers,  Brazil  was  able  to  solve  its  external  balance 
problem  after  the  1982  debt  crisis  with  surprising  speed.  The 
cost  was  a  sharp  increase  in  the  demand  for  domestic  saving  to 
replace  lost  foreign  capital  inflows.  With  little  increase  in  net 
public-sector  saving  or  in  private-sector  gross  saving,  invest- 
ment fell  substantially,  undercutting  the  growth  of  the  Brazil- 
ian capital  stock  and  the  economy's  potential  growth  in 
competitiveness. 

Capital  Flows  and  the  External  Debt 

Much  of  Brazil's  economic  experience  in  the  past  two 
decades  has  been  dominated  by  large  capital  inflows  that 
attained  record  levels  in  the  1970s,  only  to  collapse  after  1983 
in  the  wake  of  the  Mexican  debt  crisis.  For  the  rest  of  the 
decade,  Brazil  coped  with  the  consequences  of  this  collapse, 
and  only  in  the  1990s  did  capital  again  begin  to  flow  into  the

Brazilian  economy,  with  a  substantial  increase  after  the  Real 
Plan. 

The  enormous  inflow  of  external  capital  to  Brazil  that  ended 
in  1982  had  its  roots  in  a  number  of  policies  and  institutional 
changes  in  the  preceding  two  decades.  The  military  govern- 
ment that  seized  power  in  April  1964  quickly  reformed  existing 
laws  governing  direct  foreign  investments,  including  liberaliz- 
ing restrictions  on  remittances  of  profits  and  simplifying  proce- 
dures for  reinvestment  of  profits.  The  changes  did  not  address 
the  effects  of  inflation  in  the  currency  of  the  lending  country, 
however,  so  that  the  real  returns  on  a  direct  investment  were 
affected  negatively  by  inflation  in  dollar  prices.  The  negative 
effect  of  dollar  inflation  on  a  direct  foreign  investment  in  Bra- 
zil arose  because  the  original  investment  was  registered  in  a 
fixed  dollar  amount,  on  which  allowances  for  profits  and  remit- 
tances were  calculated.  A  million-dollar  investment  in  1964,  for 
example,  would  still  be  registered  as  a  million-dollar  invest- 
ment in  1974.  Higher  nominal  dollar  profits  in  1974  would 
then  result  in  a  substantially  higher  nominal  profit  rate  and  a 
heftier  Brazilian  tax,  thus  lowering  the  real  return. 

Financial  lending  to  Brazil  was  different  because  the  interest 
rate  on  the  loan,  usually  denominated  in  dollars,  incorporated 
the  market's  expectations  of  inflation.  The  asymmetrical  treat- 
ment of  financial  capital  flows  and  direct  investment  was  one  of 
the  reasons  total  capital  flows  to  Brazil  in  the  post-1964  period 
were  dominated  by  bank  lending,  which  at  times  was  ten  times 
as  great  as  foreign  direct  investment. 

Among  the  other  changes  that  encouraged  large  financial 
capital  flows  to  Brazil  was  Law  4,131,  which  allowed  final  bor- 
rowers to  deal  directly  with  foreign  lenders  after  approval  by 
the  Central  Bank  of  Brazil  (Banco  Central  do  Brasil — Bacen; 
see  Glossary).  Another  vehicle  for  capital  flows  was  Resolution 
63,  which  permitted  Brazilian  banks  and  authorized  subsidiar- 
ies of  foreign  banks  to  obtain  dollar  loans  abroad  and  reloan 
the  proceeds  to  one  or  more  domestic  borrowers.  Finally,  the 
increasing  participation  of  the  Brazilian  government  as  a  bor- 
rower itself,  backed  by  explicit  "full  faith  and  credit"  guaran- 
tees and  by  the  implicit  assumption  that  taxes  could  be  levied 
to  pay  for  loans  to  the  government,  made  lending  to  Brazil  an 
increasingly  attractive  option  for  foreign  banks. 

Equally  important  in  explaining  the  sharp  rise  in  financial 
lending  to  Brazil  after  the  mid-1960s  were  changes  in  interna- 
tional financial  markets.  International  banks  began  to  negoti- 


218 


The  Economy 


ate  variable  interest  rate  loans,  in  which  the  borrower  and  the 
lender  agreed  to  reset  the  loan's  interest  rate  at  specified  inter- 
vals, usually  six  months,  on  the  basis  of  a  rate  that  neither  the 
borrower  nor  lender  controlled  (usually  the  London  Interbank 
Offered  Rate — LIBOR),  or  the  United  States  prime  rate. 
Added  to  this  underlying  rate  was  a  "spread,"  or  premium 
charged  to  borrowers  like  Brazil,  based  on  the  market's  assess- 
ment of  any  additional  risk  compared  with  the  risks  associated 
with  prime  borrowers.  Finally,  the  rise  in  syndicated  bank  lend- 
ing, in  which  one  "lead"  bank  organized  the  loan  and  then  sold 
portions  of  it  to  other  international  lenders,  permitted  banks 
to  expand  substantially  their  loans  to  borrowers  like  Brazil. 

Together,  these  innovations  cleared  the  way  for  lending  on  a 
scale  that  was  unprecedented  in  Brazil's  history  and  with  few 
parallels  elsewhere  in  the  world.  Because  the  loans  were 
denominated  in  the  creditor  country's  currency,  they  were  iso- 
lated effectively  from  inflation  in  cruzeiro  prices.  As  long  as  the 
value  of  Brazil's  export  revenues  grew  at  rates  exceeding  the 
interest  rates  charged  on  the  loans,  an  assumption  that 
appeared  valid  throughout  the  1970s,  the  burden  of  the  exter- 
nal debt  in  relation  to  Brazil's  capacity  to  repay  it  would  fall. 

Although  it  is  easy  from  the  vantage  point  of  the  1990s  to 
criticize  the  volume  and  terms  of  much  of  the  bank  lending  to 
Brazil,  at  the  time  it  appeared  to  be  an  extremely  attractive 
option  for  a  borrower  like  Brazil.  When  inflation  in  the  curren- 
cies of  the  lending  countries  is  subtracted  from  the  rates 
charged  on  loans  to  Brazil,  real  interest  rates  on  these  loans  in 
the  1970s  were  negligible  and  often  negative.  The  nominal  and 
real  interest  rates  in  the  markets  in  which  Brazilian  external 
borrowing  occurred  do  not  include  the  spread  paid  by  Brazil, 
which  during  the  1970s  and  early  1980s  was  generally  between 
1  percent  and  2  percent.  Nevertheless,  these  rates  do  show 
clearly  why  foreign  borrowing  appeared  to  be  such  an  attrac- 
tive option  for  Brazil. 

The  debt  crisis  that  began  in  Mexico  in  August  1982  had  an 
almost  immediate  impact  on  the  ability  of  other  Latin  Ameri- 
can borrowers  to  maintain  capital  inflows.  Even  though  Brazil's 
trade  balance  and  current  account  had  improved  slightly  in 
1981,  loans  from  international  lenders  became  increasingly 
scarce.  Interest  on  new  loans  increased,  and  most  lenders 
refused  to  roll  over  on  existing  loans.  New  lending  dried  up  in 
the  second  half  of  1982,  reducing  capital  inflows,  which  had 
reached  a  peak  in  1981,  by  more  than  a  third.  Private  borrow- 


219 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

ers  in  Brazil  encountered  a  total  cutoff  of  loans  from  foreign 
lenders,  while  official  borrowing  dropped  sharply.  By  1984  net 
capital  inflows  (public  and  private)  were  negligible  by  compari- 
son with  earlier  years,  and  by  1986  the  country  was  experienc- 
ing a  net  capital  outflow  of  US$7.3  billion,  a  sum  nearly  equal 
to  Brazil's  trade  balance.  The  principal  components  of  Brazil's 
balance  of  payments  show  this  sharp  drop  in  the  net  inflow  of 
foreign  capital  after  1982  (see  table  13,  Appendix). 

The  1982  crisis  interrupted  for  many  years  private  Brazilian 
external  borrowing.  Private  loans  contracted  under  Law  4,131 
had  leveled  off  in  the  late  1970s,  and  after  1982  net  private  bor- 
rowing under  this  law  became  negative.  The  fall  in  private  bor- 
rowing under  Resolution  63  was  even  more  pronounced.  After 
a  rapid  rise  in  such  borrowing  between  1979  and  the  1982  debt 
crisis,  this  source  of  financing  virtually  collapsed,  as  the  level  of 
outstanding  Resolution  63  debt  was  more  than  cut  in  half 
between  1982  and  the  end  of  1987. 

Part,  if  not  all,  of  the  increase  in  external  debt  reported  by 
the  Central  Bank  after  1982  was  simply  forced  lending  to 
finance  interest  payments.  It  did  not  have  a  real  counterpart  in 
the  form  of  new  resources  entering  the  country  through  the 
capital  account.  As  a  result,  Brazil's  ability  to  tap  external  sav- 
ing to  finance  either  public-sector  borrowing  or  private-sector 
investment  collapsed  after  1982. 

A  number  of  Brazilian  economists  have  made  the  point  that 
before  1982  net  capital  inflows  more  than  covered  service  pay- 
ments (net  interest,  profits  and  dividends,  and  reinvested  prof- 
its). After  1982  interest  payments  alone  far  exceeded  net 
capital  inflows,  which  turned  negative  after  1985.  Although 
1982  is  usually  viewed  as  the  turning  point,  the  net  capital 
transfer  from  the  rest  of  the  world  actually  began  to  decline  in 
the  mid-1970s.  Brazil  was  only  able  to  avoid  an  external  pay- 
ments crisis  in  the  late  1970s  because  lenders  were  willing  to 
finance  debt  service  through  further  lending.  After  the  Mexi- 
can debt  crisis  in  1982,  Brazil's  own  crisis  could  no  longer  be 
postponed. 

The  1986  Cruzado  Plan  exacerbated  capital  outflows.  Real 
exchange-rate  overvaluation,  with  increasing  expectations  of  a 
future  adjustment,  was  one  factor.  A  second  factor  was  the 
increase  in  uncertainty  about  future  fiscal  and  monetary  policy, 
as  the  shortages  and  informal  markets  produced  by  the  price 
controls  undercut  the  euphoria  of  the  first  few  months. 


220 


The  Economy 


During  the  rest  of  the  1980s,  net  capital  outflow  continued, 
further  reducing  Brazil's  capacity  to  finance  investments 
needed  for  future  economic  growth.  In  real  terms,  however, 
the  external  debt  began  to  decline  in  the  late  1980s,  both  as  a 
result  of  debt  renegotiation  and  a  marking  down  of  some  of 
the  debt  by  public  and  private  lenders.  Despite  temporary 
interruptions  in  debt  servicing,  domestic  political  pressures  in 
Brazil  for  a  permanent  repudiation  of  the  external  debt  were 
rejected.  As  interest  rates  in  international  financial  markets 
declined  substantially  in  the  early  1990s,  the  costs  of  servicing 
the  remaining  external  debt  were  reduced  further. 

Although  the  debt  crisis  that  exploded  in  Brazil  in  the  early 
1980s  had  not  disappeared  a  decade  later,  it  was  no  longer 
regarded  as  Brazil's  central  economic  problem.  Its  effects,  how- 
ever, lingered  on  in  several  forms.  First,  the  steep  fall  in  the 
availability  of  international  reserves  (see  Glossary)  after  1982 
sharply  curtailed  Brazilian  investment.  The  resulting  decline  in 
capital  formation  was  evident  a  decade  later,  as  Brazilians  faced 
the  consequence  of  lower  levels  of  investment  in  plant,  equip- 
ment, and  essential  infrastructure.  Second,  international  confi- 
dence in  the  financial  soundness  of  external  lending  to  Brazil 
remained  low.  When  foreign  capital  began  to  return  to  Brazil 
in  the  early  1990s,  it  took  a  rather  different  form  from  the  cap- 
ital inflows  of  the  1970s.  Foreign  capital  inflows  to  Brazil  in  the 
early  1990s  were  smaller  and  were  no  longer  dominated  by 
loans  from  international  banks.  Instead,  foreign  lenders  sought 
equity  investments  in  Brazilian  enterprises.  Foreign  firms  with 
the  capacity  to  manage  direct  investments  in  Brazil  began  to 
replace  commercial  banks  as  the  primary  source  of  foreign 
capital. 

Fiscal  and  Monetary  Policy,  the  Public  Sector,  and 
Inflation 

In  the  1980s,  most  Brazilians  were  convinced  that  the  huge 
foreign  debt  was  at  the  heart  of  their  economic  difficulties.  A 
decade  later,  as  other  heavily  indebted  developing  nations 
reduced  inflation  to  negligible  levels  and  began  to  grow  again, 
it  was  more  apparent  that  some  of  Brazil's  economic  difficulties 
were  homemade.  By  the  early  1990s,  a  new  consensus  had 
emerged  among  Brazilian  economists  and  policy  makers.  It 
emphasized  the  role  of  the  public  sector  in  the  economy  and, 


221 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

more  specifically,  the  way  in  which  public-sector  expenditures 
are  financed. 

By  the  late  1980s,  the  overhang  of  public  debt  had  placed  a 
servicing  burden  on  the  public  sector  that  would  have  strained 
any  government.  Given  its  huge  debt  to  private  Brazilian  credi- 
tors and  foreign  creditors  alike,  the  public  sector  came  to  be 
viewed  as  practically  bankrupt.  With  new  foreign  credit  virtu- 
ally eliminated  after  1982  and  domestic  credit  increasingly 
costly,  the  government's  only  remaining  recourse  was  to 
finance  its  deficit  through  the  creation  of  money.  This  led  in 
turn  to  an  accelerating  and  unpredictable  rate  of  inflation, 
which  by  the  early  1990s  was  more  than  4,000  percent  at 
annual  rates. 

Fiscal  Trends  in  the  1980s 

In  an  inflationary  economy  like  Brazil's,  there  are  severe 
technical  problems  in  quantifying  fiscal  trends.  The  basic  diffi- 
culty stems  from  a  large  domestic  public  debt  that  is  owed  in 
cruzeiros.  A  large  part  of  reported  government  expenditures  is 
interest  payments  that  simply  compensate  the  debt  holders  for 
the  effect  of  inflation  (see  table  14,  Appendix).  Government 
interest  payments  exploded  in  the  1980s,  rising  from  less  than 
1  percent  of  GDP  in  1980  to  an  unmanageable  6.1  percent  in 
1989,  before  being  halted  temporarily  by  the  government 
freeze  on  payments  in  1990.  Despite  the  fact  that  new  foreign 
resources  were  unavailable  to  Brazil  after  1982,  interest  pay- 
ments on  the  existing  public-sector  external  debt  also 
increased  substantially  over  the  1980s. 

An  increase  in  domestic  and  foreign  interest  payments  could 
be  financed  if  other  parts  of  the  public  sector's  accounts  were 
to  change  enough  to  create  a  "primary"  budget  surplus 
(approximately  the  difference  between  tax  receipts  and  nonin- 
terest-related  public  expenditures).  In  Brazil  the  reverse  hap- 
pened. The  noninterest-related  surplus  declined  sharply, 
beginning  in  the  1970s  and  accelerating  in  the  late  1980s. 

A  number  of  reasons  account  for  this  trend.  Tax  receipts  as  a 
share  of  GDP  declined  significantly  in  the  early  1980s,  partly  as 
a  result  of  the  difficulties  inherent  in  maintaining  tax  collec- 
tions with  accelerating  inflation.  By  the  late  1980s,  tax  receipts, 
net  of  transfers  for  such  items  as  social  security,  were  insuffi- 
cient even  to  pay  for  public-sector  wages  and  salaries  and  pur- 
chases of  goods  and  services.

On  the  expenditure  side,  Brazil's  return  to  a  more  open, 
democratic  political  system  in  the  mid-1980s  made  it  difficult,  if 
not  impossible,  for  political  leaders  to  contain  public  expendi- 
tures for  personnel  costs,  goods,  and  services.  Between  1980 
and  1990,  the  share  of  such  expenditures  in  GDP  mushroomed 
from  9.2  to  15.6  percent. 

Grim  as  these  trends  were,  they  were  probably  underesti- 
mates of  Brazil's  true  fiscal  situation.  In  the  early  1970s,  the 
public  enterprises  were  operated  profitably,  and  the  prices  of 
their  products  and  services  at  least  kept  up  with  inflation.  With 
the  acceleration  of  inflation  after  the  two  oil  shocks  in  the 
1970s,  the  fiscal  position  of  the  public  enterprises  began  to 
worsen,  although  this  trend  was  not  recognized  widely  until  the 
1980s. 


223 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

It  was  not  until  the  1980s  that  the  Erazilian  government, 
partly  because  of  pressure  from  foreign  creditors  and  multilat- 
eral organizations,  such  as  the  International  Monetary  Fund 
(IMF — see  Glossary)  and  the  World  Bank  (see  Glossary),  began 
to  publish  more  extensive  statements  on  the  public  sector's 
finances.  In  1983  the  government  began  preparing  estimates  of 
the  Public  Sector  Borrowing  Requirement  (PSBR).  These  esti- 
mates included  not  only  the  expenditures  of  the  federal,  state, 
and  local  governments  but  also  those  of  state  enterprises,  social 
security  authorities,  and  a  number  of  previously  "off-budget" 
activities.  These  estimates  clearly  show  that  Brazil's  fiscal  imbal- 
ances worsened  even  more  in  the  1980s  than  is  suggested  by 
more  traditional  measures. 

Had  the  worsening  trend  in  the  PSBR  been  simply  the  result 
of  increases  in  nominal  interest  payments,  inflation  alone 
might  have  been  blamed.  In  fact,  many  of  the  intellectual  pro- 
ponents of  what  became  the  Cruzado  Plan  made  this  argument 
in  the  1980s.  These  proponents  maintained  that  if  inflation 
could  be  stopped  (through  a  price  freeze  or  other  means),  the 
public  sector's  deficit  would  disappear.  Even  if  the  effects  of 
inflation  were  accounted  for,  however,  Brazil  would  have  had  a 
large  public-sector  debt. 

Pressures  on  Public-Sector  Expenditures  in  the  1980s 

Despite  the  popular  image  of  Brazil's  public  sector  as  a  prof- 
ligate spender  and  intense  consumer  of  resources,  public 
expenditures  as  a  share  of  national  product  remained  relatively 
stable  until  the  mid-1980s.  The  containment  of  public  spend- 
ing under  the  government  of  President  Joao  Batista  de  OHveira 
Figueiredo  (1979-85)  at  the  federal  level  included  limitations 
on  hiring  and  expenditures  on  goods  and  services  as  well  as 
cuts  in  public  investment.  Spending  by  state  and  local  govern- 
ments was  limited  by  reductions  in  the  revenues  transferred  to 
them  by  the  federal  government. 

Total  spending  for  public-sector  wages  and  salaries,  which 
had  actually  declined  as  a  share  of  national  product  between 
the  early  1970s  and  1984,  only  began  to  increase  when  the  gov- 
ernment of  President  Jose  Sarney  (1985-90)  took  over,  reach- 
ing almost  10  percent  of  GDP  in  1989.  Public-sector  spending 
on  goods  and  services  as  a  share  of  GDP  also  increased  under 
President  Sarney.  A  fall  in  net  subsidies  to  the  private  sector 
and  a  stable  level  of  social  security  spending  were  not  sufficient 
to  offset  a  sharp  rise  in  government  spending  on  wages  and  sal- 


224 


The  Economy 


aries.  The  expansion  of  public  spending  after  1985  occurred  at 
all  levels  of  government.  At  the  federal  level,  it  was  partly 
caused  by  the  efforts  of  President  Sarney  to  secure  a  full  five- 
year  mandate,  reinforced  by  the  misperception  that  Brazil's 
budget  deficit  would  be  negligible  if  the  effects  of  inflation  on 
it  were  discounted.  At  the  state  and  local  levels,  greater  reve- 
nues were  available  as  a  result  of  changes  in  federal  transfers 
after  1985,  a  trend  reinforced  by  the  1988  constitution.  Much 
of  this  spending  went  for  current  expenses,  primarily  person- 
nel, rather  than  investment  in  infrastructure.  Even  with  this 
expansion  in  state  and  local  spending,  however,  the  federal 
government  remained  responsible  for  about  two-thirds  of  total 
expenditures.  State  spending  was  primarily  for  education  and 
health,  and  local  government  expenditures  were  devoted  prin- 
cipally to  housing  and  urban  development.  At  all  levels  of  gov- 
ernment, however,  much  of  this  spending,  whatever  the 
announced  function,  was  for  personnel  and  administrative 
costs. 

The  worsening  of  Brazil's  public-sector  finances  in  the  1980s 
was  in  part  the  consequence  of  the  political  and  administrative 
decentralization  that  took  place  following  the  return  to  civilian 
rule  in  1985.  In  1988  the  new  constitution  made  this  decentral- 
ization explicit,  transferring  to  state  and  local  governments  a 
substantial  part  of  the  revenues  that  were  formerly  received  by 
the  federal  government.  There  was  not,  however,  a  parallel 
decentralization  of  expenditure  responsibilities.  The  federal 
government  retained  most  of  its  functional  responsibilities, 
while  losing  a  significant  part  of  its  revenues. 

Trends  in  tax  revenues  after  1983  further  aggravated  Brazil's 
public-sector  finances.  Tax  receipts  as  a  share  of  GDP  fell 
sharply  after  1983,  having  averaged  about  25  percent  in  the 
preceding  decade.  With  the  exception  of  the  atypical  year  of 
1986  (the  Cruzado  Plan),  they  did  not  regain  such  levels  until 
the  first  years  of  the  Collor  de  Mello  government,  when 
increases  in  income  taxes  and  social  security  contributions,  as 
well  as  taxes  on  manufactured  goods  and  financial  operations, 
slowed  the  decline  in  revenues. 

Although  the  federal  government  in  the  early  1990s  made 
determined  efforts  to  maintain  its  income  by  enforcing  tax  col- 
lection, these  efforts  met  with  limited  success.  Public  cynicism 
about  the  government's  use  of  tax  revenues,  fed  in  part  by  the 
corruption  scandal  that  forced  Collor  de  Mello  from  office  in 
September  1992,  led  to  increased  tax  avoidance  and  in  many 


225 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

cases  to  outright  tax  evasion.  Although  little  firm  evidence  is 
available  to  quantify  tax  evasion,  considerable  anecdotal  and 
fragmentary  evidence  suggests  that  it  rose  significantly  in  the 
1980s  and  early  1990s.  With  the  increased  financial  opening  of 
the  economy,  many  Brazilians  sought  to  shelter  income  derived 
from  financial  assets  by  placing  them  outside  Brazil,  even  when 
before-tax  returns  in  Brazil  were  substantially  higher.  Capital 
flight  from  Brazil,  which  had  not  been  as  serious  a  problem  as 
it  had  been  for  a  number  of  other  Latin  American  nations  in 
the  1970s  and  early  1980s,  accelerated  significantly  in  the  late 
1980s.  Other  ways  in  which  Brazilians  evaded  taxes  included 
substantial  understatement  of  income  from  professional  and 
service  activities  and  the  widespread  practice  of  making  trans- 
actions without  documentation  for  tax  purposes. 

The  adoption  of  the  new  constitution  in  1988  had  a  signifi- 
cant impact  on  public-sector  finances.  Many  Brazilians  viewed 
it  as  the  vehicle  through  which  to  redress  what  they  regarded  as 
excessive  concentration  of  powers  at  the  federal  level.  Conse- 
quently, strong  support  existed  for  decentralizing  government 
and  shifting  power  from  the  presidency  to  the  Congress.  Many 
Brazilians  also  saw  the  new  constitution  as  a  way  not  only  to 
guarantee  civil  rights  but  also  to  secure  specific  economic 
rights  in  the  areas  of  health,  education,  employment  guaran- 
tees, and  social  security. 

The  result  was  a  document  that  is  far  more  specific  and 
lengthier  than  those  of  most  other  nations.  Some  advances 
were  made  in  the  arrangement  of  public  finances,  among  them 
restrictions  on  off-budget  spending  by  the  executive  and  better 
defined  procedures  for  the  preparation  and  passage  of  an 
annual  budget.  In  a  larger  sense,  however,  the  1988  constitu- 
tion made  the  potential  for  fiscal  deterioration  more  likely, 
especially  at  the  federal  level.  It  not  only  reduced  the  revenues 
that  went  to  the  federal  government  by  transferring  them  to 
states  and  municipalities  but  also  linked  many  revenue  sources 
to  specific  objectives,  further  restricting  the  federal  govern- 
ment's ability  to  allocate  expenditures.  In  addition,  the  new 
charter  actually  expanded  some  federal  responsibilities  in  a 
number  of  areas,  among  them  law  enforcement,  education, 
and  cultural  affairs.  Another  provision  granted  tenure  to  pub- 
lic employees  after  two  years.  The  constitution  strengthened 
employment  and  pension  guarantees  and  the  explicitly  main- 
tained pension  and  retirement  rights  based  on  length  of  ser- 
vice— thirty-five  years  for  men  and  thirty  years  for  women —

without  regard  to  age  at  retirement.  Together,  these  provisions 
made  fiscal  equilibrium,  especially  at  the  federal  level,  even 
more  difficult  to  attain  than  it  had  been  before  1988. 

A  number  of  Brazilian  economists  and  policy  makers  soon 
recognized  the  budgetary  implications  of  the  new  constitution. 
The  stabilization  program  of  the  new  Collor  de  Mello  govern- 
ment in  1990  temporarily  halted  the  decline  in  federal  govern- 
ment revenue  through  its  price  and  wage  freezes,  but  this  was 
done  at  a  very  high  cost.  The  dramatic  freezing  of  most  Brazil- 
ians' financial  wealth  under  the  first  Collor  de  Mello  plan 
raised  basic  legal  and  constitutional  questions  about  the  fiscal 
rights  and  responsibilities  of  the  government.  A  number  of 
Brazilian  legal  scholars  questioned  the  right  of  the  government 
to  impose  what  they  argued  was  a  tax,  not  allowed  for  in  the 
constitution,  through  the  freezing  of  assets  whose  full  real 
value  would  not  be  repaid  to  their  holders. 

By  the  early  1990s,  a  consensus  had  emerged  that  successful 
economic  and  price  stabilization  would  require  profound 
changes  in  Brazil's  fiscal  system  and,  if  necessary,  amendments 
to  the  1988  constitution.  Although  such  views  were  rejected  vig- 
orously if  suggested  by  others,  such  as  the  IMF  or  foreign  lend- 
ers, many  Brazilians  recognized  that  the  1988  constitution  had 
created  a  number  of  fiscal  problems.  In  October  1991,  the  Col- 
lor de  Mello  government  submitted  to  Congress  a  series  of  pro- 
posals aimed  at  reducing  the  fiscal  pressures  at  the  federal 
level.  Among  the  proposed  changes  were  modifications  of  the 
constitutional  obstacles  to  administrative  reform,  limitations 
on  the  constitutional  guarantees  for  social  security,  and  author- 
ity to  create  new  sources  of  federal  tax  revenue.  With  the  ero- 
sion of  support  for  the  Collor  de  Mello  government  during 
1992,  the  proposals  had  little  chance  of  passage,  and  the  funda- 
mental fiscal  disequilibrium  continued  under  the  administra- 
tion of  Itamar  Franco  (1992-95),  Collor  de  Mello's  successor. 

Fiscal  Deficits  and  Inflation 

The  root  of  Brazilian  inflation  has  been  the  monetization  of 
the  public  sector's  fiscal  deficit,  because  deficits  that  are  not 
financed  by  borrowing  either  from  abroad  or  domestically 
must  be  covered  by  the  creation  of  money.  By  the  early  1990s, 
the  old  debate  between  the  monetarists  (see  Glossary),  who 
emphasized  the  central  role  of  money  supply  growth  in  the 
inflationary  process,  and  the  structuralists  (see  Glossary),  who 
attributed  price  increases  to  supply  problems  in  developing 


227 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

economies  like  Brazil's,  was  viewed  as  an  obsolete  and  largely 
sterile  discussion.  Instead,  debate  focused  on  the  causal  rela- 
tionship between  inflation  and  the  money  supply,  and  on  how 
much  freedom  the  government  actually  had  in  determining 
money-supply  growth. 

However  important  monetization  of  the  public  sector's  fiscal 
deficit  may  have  been  in  the  past  in  either  initiating  or  acceler- 
ating inflation,  the  reinforcement  of  the  inflationary  process 
by  past  inflation  and  by  expectations  of  future  inflation  was  an 
important  part  of  the  Brazilian  experience  in  the  1980s  and 
1990s.  In  Brazil  the  feedback  effect  of  past  inflation  has  been 
institutionalized  in  an  extensive  indexation  or  "monetary  cor- 
rection" (correfdo  monetdria)  system,  which  was  developed  and 
extended  to  most  markets  between  1964  and  1970.  The  result 
was  an  economy  in  which  apparently  modest  initial  shocks 
could  be  transformed  into  high  and  continuing  inflation.  Rec- 
ognition of  this  feedback  effect  in  the  early  1980s  played  a  role 
in  the  design  of  the  1986  Cruzado  Plan,  as  well  as  in  subse- 
quent stabilization  attempts,  notably  the  ifoa/Plan  in  1994.  The 
inflation  indexation  system,  which  in  the  1970s  had  been  virtu- 
ally unquestioned,  was  increasingly  blamed  for  contributing  to 
the  continuation  and  acceleration  of  inflation  in  the  1980s  and 
early  1990s. 

Although  inflation  accelerated  significantly  in  the  1980s,  it 
had  long  been  a  feature  of  Brazil's  economy.  The  first  major 
inflationary  surge  began  in  the  late  1950s  and  continued  until 
1964,  in  part  the  result  of  the  monetary  accommodation  of  fis- 
cal pressures  resulting  from  a  sharp  rise  in  government  expen- 
ditures. A  second  surge  began  in  the  1970s,  partly  as  a  result  of 
the  external  shocks  caused  by  the  rise  in  energy  prices.  The 
indexation  system  served  as  a  vehicle  for  amplifying  energy 
price  increases  into  higher  widespread  price  increases  than 
might  have  occurred.  Inflation  worsened  dramatically  in  the 
1980s,  however,  as  Brazil  lost  its  access  to  foreign  capital  mar- 
kets and  domestic  borrowing  to  finance  the  growing  public-sec- 
tor deficit  became  increasingly  expensive  (see  table  15, 
Appendix).  Inevitably,  money  creation  became  one  of  the  pri- 
mary ways  to  finance  the  deficit. 

It  is  difficult  for  non-Brazilians  to  grasp  the  significance  of 
double-digit  inflation  for  forty  years,  with  triple-  and  even  qua- 
druple-digit inflation  in  the  1980s.  By  the  late  1980s,  annual 
rates  of  inflation  were  almost  meaningless,  and  Brazilians 
themselves  routinely  characterized  inflation  by  its  monthly 


228 


The  Economy 


rate,  which  in  the  early  1990s  was  over  35  percent.  Between  the 
end  of  World  War  II  and  Brazil's  RealPlan  in  1994,  the  price 
level  had  increased  more  than  100  billion  times. 

Not  only  did  inflation  accelerate  over  the  1980s,  but  the  rate 
became  more  variable  and  less  predictable.  The  frequency  of 
price  adjustments  increased,  and  wage  and  salary  adjustments 
that  had  once  occurred  annually  were  adjusted  semiannually, 
then  quarterly,  and  in  some  markets  monthly,  as  inflation  accel- 
erated. In  other  markets,  especially  the  capital  markets,  infla- 
tion had  similar  effects  in  shortening  contract  periods.  Few 
borrowers  or  lenders  would  dare  to  make  long-term  commit- 
ments, and  by  the  late  1980s  most  Brazilian  firms,  as  well  as 
most  wealthier  individuals,  held  any  excess  assets  in  short-term, 
highly  liquid  deposits  that  were  literally  known  as  the  "over- 
night." 

The  rise  in  indexation  in  Brazil  after  1964  had  permitted  the 
government  to  tap  the  supply  of  domestic  saving  by  selling 
indexed  government  bonds  to  savers,  who  were  thus  protected 
against  the  effects  of  inflation  on  the  value  of  such  assets. 
Although  indexed  bonds  were  regarded  as  a  great  success  in 
the  1960s  and  1970s,  the  need  to  pay  not  only  the  interest  but 
also  the  inflation  adjustment  became  an  increasing  burden  for 
the  government  in  the  1980s. 

Despite  the  burden  that  indexed  bonds  placed  on  govern- 
ment finances  as  inflation  accelerated,  inflation  itself  appears 
to  have  been  an  important  source  of  revenue  for  the  govern- 
ment. The  "inflation  tax,"  which  is  the  real  income  that  the 
government  receives  through  the  issuance  of  new  money,  tends 
to  increase  with  inflation,  because  nonindexed  money  or  par- 
tially indexed  financial  assets  issued  by  the  government  lose 
their  real  value.  This  loss  in  spending  power  incurred  by  the 
holders  of  money  is  in  effect  a  tax,  because  the  government 
spending  financed  by  money  creation  is  paid  for  by  the  loss  in 
value  of  the  money  held  by  the  public.  Attempts  have  been 
made  to  measure  the  income  that  the  Brazilian  government 
earned  through  the  inflation  tax,  and  some  estimates  suggest 
that  income  from  this  source  in  the  1980s  was  over  3  or  4  per- 
cent of  GDP. 

Brazil's  Real  Plan 

On  July  1,  1994,  Brazil  implemented  the  last,  and  to  date, 
most  successful  of  its  economic  stabilization  programs  to  end 
inflation.  Nearly  three  years  later,  the  Real  Plan  was  intact,  far 


229 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

outliving  its  ill-fated  predecessors.  By  late  1996,  inflation  by 
some  measures  approached  an  annual  rate  of  less  than  20  per- 
cent, a  remarkable  achievement  in  an  economy  that  a  few  years 
earlier  would  have  regarded  even  a  monthly  rate  at  this  level  a 
triumph.  The  new  monetary  unit  created  by  the  plan,  the  real 
(pi.,  reais;  for  value  of  the  real,  see  Glossary),  actually  appre- 
ciated against  the  dollar  in  the  months  after  its  creation. 

The  design  and  implementation  of  the  Real  Plan  also  distin- 
guished it  from  the  earlier  plans,  and  may  help  explain  some  of 
its  success  in  its  first  years.  Unlike  the  earlier  plans,  it  did  not 
depend  on  a  general  price  and  wage  freeze  to  stop  inflation.  At 
the  heart  of  the  new  plan  was  the  de-indexation  of  the  Brazil- 
ian economy,  which  was  accomplished  in  part  by  converting  sal- 
aries and  a  number  of  other  prices  in  the  months  preceding 
the  implementation  of  the  Real  Plan  into  Real  Value  Units 
(URVs),  which  were  then  linked  to  the  United  States  dollar. 
After  July  1,  1994,  prices  in  URVs  were  converted  into  reais, 
which  began  officially  at  par  with  the  dollar,  but  traded  at  a  pre- 
mium in  the  open  market.  Although  the  new  plan  made  no 
guarantees  of  automatic  price  and  wage  adjustments  to  com- 
pensate for  inflation,  few  restrictions  were  placed  on  employers 
and  employees  in  private  wage  negotiations. 

Although  some  observers  characterized  the  Real  Plan  as  a 
form  of  "dollarization"  of  the  Brazilian  economy,  in  which 
prices  and  wages  that  previously  had  been  indexed  to  inflation 
were  now  linked  to  a  foreign  currency,  there  was  a  significant 
difference  between  Brazil's  approach  and  that  of  countries  like 
Argentina,  which  attempted  to  stabilize  the  value  of  their  cur- 
rencies through  a  formal  and  legal  link  to  the  dollar.  Brazil  did 
not  make  such  a  commitment,  and  despite  the  stability  of  the 
real  against  the  dollar  throughout  the  first  year  and  a  half  of  the 
RealVl&n,  there  was  a  widespread  expectation  that  the  real 
eventually  would  depreciate. 

This  exchange-rate  policy  and  the  expectations  that  accom- 
panied it  had  significant  consequences  for  the  domestic  Brazil- 
ian economy.  Expectations  of  an  eventual  depreciation  of  the 
currency,  coupled  with  the  short-term  stability  of  the  exchange 
rate  and  much  greater  mobility  of  financial  capital  between 
Brazil  and  world  financial  markets  led  to  a  strong  appreciation 
of  the  rm/and  painfully  high  domestic  real  interest  rates.  Lend- 
ers required  interest  rates  that  would  protect  them  against  a 
possible  depreciation.  With  prices  stable  or  even  falling  for 
some  products,  borrowers  could  not  repay  in  currency  that  had

lost  its  value  through  inflation,  as  they  were  accustomed  to  do 
in  earlier  years. 

International  enthusiasm  for  the  Real  Plan,  reinforced  by  its 
apparent  success  in  its  first  year,  led  to  the  resumption  of  large- 
scale  flows  to  Brazil,  permitting  the  government  to  maintain  its 
policy  of  approximate  exchange-rate  stability.  Despite  the  wor- 
ries about  a  depreciation,  and  several  speculative  attacks 
against  the  real  in  its  first  year,  the  high  level  of  capital  flows  to 
Brazil  more  than  financed  the  high  level  of  imports  stimulated 
by  the  resumption  of  economic  growth,  leading  to  a  sharp 
increase  in  Brazil's  reserves  of  foreign  currency.  By  late  1995, 
they  totaled  more  than  US$50  billion. 

The  fall  in  inflation,  supported  in  part  by  the  strong  real,  led 
to  important  changes  in  income  flows  within  the  Brazilian 
economy.  Decades  of  inflation  had  produced  a  large  financial 
sector,  which  flourished  in  part  through  the  spread  between 
borrowing  and  lending  rated  in  a  high-inflation  environment. 
With  the  fall  in  this  revenue,  a  number  of  financial  intermedi- 
aries came  under  severe  pressure,  despite  the  high  real  interest 
rates.  During  1995  there  were  bank  insolvencies,  with  failures 


231 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

avoided  by  Central  Bank  intervention  to  merge  these  interme- 
diaries with  stronger  ones. 

The  fall  in  inflation  also  had  consequences  for  Brazil's 
income  distribution.  Lower-income  groups,  which  had  borne  a 
disproportionately  large  share  of  the  inflationary  burden 
because  of  their  relatively  limited  access  to  fully  indexed  sav- 
ings opportunities  and  to  the  tendency  of  minimum  salaries 
and  other  nominal  wages  to  lag  behind  inflation,  benefited  sig- 
nificantly from  the  RealVXan.  In  the  months  following  its  imple- 
mentation, sales  of  consumer  durables,  especially  those 
purchased  by  lower-income  groups,  increased  significantly, 
leading  the  government  in  1995  to  attempt  to  restrict  con- 
sumption and  reward  saving.  The  rise  in  the  real  incomes  of 
lower-  income  groups  produced  a  level  and  depth  of  political 
support  for  the  Real  Plan  that  made  it  difficult  for  unions  and 
other  groups  opposing  many  of  the  policies  of  the  new  Cardoso 
government  to  confront  the  RealVXm  head  on.  It  also  may  have 
helped  the  government  in  its  efforts  to  secure  the  support  of 
the  Congress  for  a  number  of  its  proposed  reforms. 

The  Real  Plan's  success  in  its  first  year  strengthened  the  polit- 
ical support  that  the  government  needed  to  attack  the  underly- 
ing fiscal  disequilibrium.  By  1995  the  operational  budget  of  the 
federal  government  was  significantly  smaller  than  it  had  been 
in  earlier  years,  and  the  attempts  by  some  organized  sectors, 
among  them  the  employees  of  state  enterprises,  to  overturn 
many  of  the  policies  of  the  RealFlan  had  been  resisted.  Further 
progress  in  reducing  the  pressures  on  the  finances  of  Brazil's 
public  sector  rested  on  the  rates  of  the  first  year  of  the  Real 
Plan,  as  well  as  on  the  support  of  Congress  for  the  fiscal 
reforms  proposed  by  the  Cardoso  government. 

By  the  end  of  1996,  the  Real  Plan  appeared  to  have  suc- 
ceeded in  its  objective  of  ending  decades  of  inflation  and  mac- 
roeconomic  uncertainty.  It  had  also  bought  valuable  time  for 
the  government  to  attack  the  underlying  fiscal  imbalance  that 
generated  the  inflationary  pressures.  There  was  little  time  to  be 
lost,  however,  and  the  rise  in  public-sector  expenditures,  espe- 
cially at  the  state  and  municipal  levels,  cast  a  cloud  over  the 
prospect  for  the  long-run  success  of  the  Real  Plan.  This  rise  was 
the  consequence  of  a  number  of  factors,  among  them  the 
surge  in  costs  for  public-sector  employees  created  in  part  by  the 
requirements  of  the  1988  constitution.  In  the  short  run,  the 
rise  in  interest  costs  in  the  first  year  of  the  RealFlan  was  a  heavy 
burden  for  many  states  and  municipalities,  some  of  which  were 


232 


The  Economy 


unable  in  1995  to  pay  employees  their  full  salaries.  Other  pres- 
sures on  the  public  sector  included  rising  pension  and  social 
security  costs,  caused  in  part  by  demographic  trends  and  by  the 
generous  promises  of  earlier  governments  to  future  retirees. 

Trade  Policies 

Brazil's  economic  history  has  been  influenced  remarkably  by 
foreign  trade  trends  and  policies.  Successive  cycles  of  export 
booms  in  such  commodities  as  sugar,  gold  and  diamonds,  rub- 
ber, and  coffee  played  major  roles  in  Brazilian  development 
before  World  War  II.  In  the  1930s,  the  collapse  of  coffee  prices 
signaled  a  turn  inward,  resulting  in  a  nascent  industrialization. 
In  succeeding  decades,  industrial  development  was  fostered 
deliberately  through  restrictive  trade  policies,  making  Brazil  a 
relatively  closed  economy  by  the  mid-1960s.  Only  in  the  early 
1990s  did  Brazil  begin  significant  liberalization  of  its  trade  poli- 
cies, and  even  these  reforms  were  modest  by  comparison  with 
those  in  a  number  of  other  Latin  American  nations. 

Government  intervention  in  foreign  trade  has  a  long  history 
in  Brazil,  reaching  back  to  the  colonial  period  when  Portugal 
forbade  Brazilian  trade  with  other  nations.  Following  indepen- 
dence in  1822,  Brazil  opened  its  ports  and  expanded  its  trade 
with  other  nations,  particularly  Britain.  Extensive  government 
regulation  of  trade  continued,  however,  with  tariffs  providing 
over  half  of  the  government's  revenue  before  World  War  I. 
Other  forms  of  intervention  in  trade  included  the  1906  coffee 
price  support  plan,  which  was  a  sophisticated  attempt  to 
exploit  Brazil's  monopolistic  position  in  the  world  coffee  mar- 
ket. 

Before  World  War  II,  trade  policies  were  used  mostly  as  a 
source  of  revenue  or  as  a  response  to  specific  groups  such  as 
the  coffee  producers,  rather  than  as  a  means  of  achieving 
national  economic  goals.  In  the  early  1950s,  Brazil  began  to  use 
trade  policy  in  a  more  deliberate  way  to  promote  industrializa- 
tion. The  forced  reduction  in  Brazilian  imports  after  1929  had 
resulted  in  the  first  major  industrial  growth  in  Brazil,  centered 
in  Sao  Paulo.  Heeding  this  apparent  lesson,  policy  makers  in 
the  1950s  argued  that  measures  that  deliberately  reduced 
imports  would  stimulate  domestic  production,  thereby  encour- 
aging technological  development  and  increasing  employment 
in  activities  that  were  regarded  as  more  "modern"  than  Brazil's 
traditional  agricultural  and  extractive  activities. 


233 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Between  1953  and  1957,  Brazil  attempted  to  use  multiple 
exchange  rates  to  encourage  some  trade  transactions  and  dis- 
courage others.  In  1957  the  country  instituted  a  broad  ad  valo- 
rem tariff  system  under  Law  3,244.  The  new  system  created  not 
only  a  new  tariff  structure  but  also  the  administrative  machin- 
ery to  impose  or  revise  tariffs  in  accord  with  national  develop- 
ment objectives  and  requests  by  domestic  producers  for 
protection.  Implementation  of  the  system  heavily  favored 
domestic  producers  of  manufactured  consumer  goods,  while 
permitting  the  import  of  capital  and  intermediate  goods  at 
much  lower  tariffs.  For  some  goods,  protection  was  great 
enough  to  completely  eliminate  competing  imports  from  the 
Brazilian  market. 

Following  the  imposition  of  military  rule  in  1964,  Brazil 
once  again  modified  its  trade  policies.  The  new  government 
moved  quickly  to  eliminate  some  of  the  restrictions  on  Brazil- 
ian exports,  and  it  provided  special  incentives  for  exports  of 
manufactures.  In  March  1967,  it  significantly  cut  tariffs,  which 
fell  to  about  half  their  former  level  in  a  number  of  sectors.  Bra- 
zilian imports  soon  increased,  but  this  was  more  the  result  of 
the  acceleration  of  economic  growth  after  1967  than  of  the  tar- 
iff reforms.  During  the  "economic  miracle"  between  1967  and 
1973,  the  GDP  grew  at  record  rates.  Throughout  this  period, 
trade  policy  continued  to  be  relatively  open  in  comparison  with 
Brazilian  policies  before  or  after  the  economic  miracle. 

The  steep  rise  in  world  oil  prices  that  began  in  late  1973 
soon  ended  Brazil's  move  toward  greater  trade  openness.  The 
approximate  balance  between  imports  and  exports  in  the  early 
1970s  became  an  unprecedented  US$4.7  billion  deficit  in  1974. 
Although  record  levels  of  external  capital  flows  financed  this 
deficit,  Brazilian  policy  makers  responded  by  restricting 
imports.  In  June  1974,  import  financing  for  many  products  was 
suspended,  while  tariff  rates  on  more  than  900  items  were  dou- 
bled. Over  the  year,  restrictions  were  increased  further,  and  in 
1975  the  government  required  that  imports  be  paid  for  in 
advance  with  deposits  that  did  not  earn  interest  or  any  correc- 
tion for  inflation.  On  the  export  side,  further  measures  were 
taken  to  promote  exports,  especially  for  manufactures.  Despite 
these  measures,  Brazil's  trade  balance  remained  in  deficit  for 
most  of  the  1970s. 

The  worsening  of  Brazil's  external  payments  position  in  the 
early  1980s  forced  policy  makers  to  turn  to  other  measures  to 
attempt  to  restore  external  balance,  among  them  adjustment

in  the  exchange  rate,  which  was  devalued  sharply  early  in  1983. 
Controls  on  trade  were  not  relaxed,  however,  and  the  cessation 
of  voluntary  lending  to  Brazil  following  the  Mexican  debt  crisis 
in  1982  had  significant  effects  on  trade  policy.  Import  controls 
that  had  been  introduced  in  response  to  the  worsening  trade 
balance  in  1980  were  strengthened  by  centralization  of  all  for- 
eign-exchange transactions  in  the  Central  Bank.  A  negative  list, 
which  enumerated  items  whose  import  was  suspended,  was 
expanded  considerably,  and  financing  for  imports  was  further 
restricted. 

The  combination  of  tightened  import  controls,  real  depreci- 
ation, and  the  fall  in  domestic  demand  induced  by  the  restric- 
tive macroeconomic  policies  of  the  early  1980s  resulted  in  a 
sharp  adjustment  in  Brazil's  external  accounts.  The  magnitude 
of  the  adjustment  appears  to  have  surprised  even  many  of  its 
proponents,  both  in  the  Brazilian  government  and  among 
creditors.  After  1983  the  massive  trade  surpluses  averaged 
more  than  3  percent  of  GDP,  compared  with  negative  or  negli- 
gible levels  through  most  of  the  1968-82  period.  In  1984,  as  the 
full  effects  of  the  adjustment  program  were  felt,  exports  were 
about  double  imports,  and  Brazil's  trade  surplus  reached  an 
unprecedented  6.1  percent  of  GDP,  far  exceeding  the  compa- 
rable shares  in  other  important  economies  such  as  Japan  (3.5 
percent  of  GDP)  and  West  Germany  (3.8  percent). 

Most  of  the  import  controls  that  were  used  after  1982  were 
in  place  well  before  the  cessation  of  voluntary  external  lend- 
ing. One  of  these  measures,  introduced  in  1980  following  the 
worsening  of  the  current  account,  was  the  financing  require- 
ment for  specific  imports.  Another  form  of  import  control, 
much  used  after  1982,  was  the  establishment  of  formal  import 
programs,  which  were  negotiated  agreements  between  import- 
ing firms  and  the  Department  of  Foreign  Trade  (Carteira  de 
Comercio  Exterior — Cacex).  These  agreements  in  effect 
turned  the  import  decision  into  a  process  that  depended  more 
on  administrative  and  political  considerations  than  on  eco- 
nomic merit.  The  high  degree  of  administrative  control  that 
these  agreements  gave  to  Cacex  created  problems,  because 
middle-level  trade  officials  acquired  extensive  control  over  the 
fortunes  of  an  enterprise  through  their  ability  to  approve  par- 
ticular trade  transactions. 

By  1984  it  was  clear  that  the  successful  external  adjustment 
had  a  domestic  price,  as  inflation  accelerated  to  more  than  200 
percent  at  annual  rates.  Trade  policy  consequently  began  to  be

viewed  as  a  potential  instrument  for  internal  stabilization,  with 
some  import  liberalization  viewed  as  a  potential  contributor  to 
reduced  inflation. 

In  late  1984,  a  number  of  the  direct  controls  on  imports 
were  cut  back,  and  the  number  of  products  on  the  negative  list 
was  reduced  substantially.  Import  financing  requirements  were 
also  relaxed  through  exemptions,  and  tariff  surcharges  were 
replaced  by  smaller  additions  to  the  legal  tariff.  On  the  admin- 
istrative side,  the  Cacex  policy  of  import  restrictions  for  bal- 
ance of  payments  purposes  was  reduced. 

In  February  1986,  following  several  months  in  which  the 
prices  accelerated  at  an  average  of  more  than  500  percent,  the 
Sarney  government  decreed  the  now  infamous  Cruzado  Plan. 
Although  the  plan  was  presented  as  a  definitive  program  to  de- 
index  the  economy  and  wipe  out  inflation,  its  main  thrust  was 
to  freeze  prices.  Wages  were  not  frozen  and  in  fact  were 
increased  by  8  percent  when  the  plan  was  announced.  Foreign 
economic  policy  in  the  plan  consisted  primarily  of  fixing  the 
exchange  rate,  and  no  trade  policy  changes  were  included  in 
the  plan. 

The  combination  of  increased  domestic  real  income,  a  fixed 
nominal  exchange  rate,  and  a  fall  in  nominal  interest  rates 
soon  produced  a  sharp  increase  in  excess  demand.  In  sectors 
less  affected  by  price  controls,  such  as  clothing  or  used  automo- 
biles, prices  rose  sharply.  The  effects  on  the  trade  balance  were 
apparent  within  several  months  after  the  plan  was  decreed. 
The  value  of  monthly  exports  fell  by  about  40  percent  between 
March  and  November  1986,  and  imports  rose  rapidly  begin- 
ning in  May.  For  the  year,  exports  fell  by  12.7  percent  from 
1985  levels,  and  imports  increased  by  5.7  percent.  Brazil's 
external  payments  problems,  which  had  appeared  to  be  largely 
resolved  by  the  record  trade  balances  after  1983,  emerged  once 
again,  as  the  trade  balance  fell  from  US$12.5  billion  in  1985  to 
US$8.3  billion  in  1986. 

The  policy  response  to  the  worsening  trade  balance  con- 
sisted of  a  small  1.8  percent  devaluation  in  October  1986, 
accompanied  by  administrative  tightening  of  import  controls. 
In  early  1987,  the  negative  list  was  once  again  increased,  and 
some  of  the  loss  in  exchange-rate  competitiveness  was  regained 
with  nominal  devaluations  of  the  cruzado  (for  value  of  the 
cruzado — see  Glossary)  of  7.8  percent  and  8.7  percent  in  May 
and  June  of  1987.

Brazil's  second  price-stabilization  attempt,  popularly  known 
as  the  Bresser  Plan,  was  announced  by  the  new  minister  of 
finance,  Luiz  Carlos  Bresser  Pereira,  in  June  1987.  In  contrast 
to  the  ill-fated  Cruzado  Plan,  the  Bresser  Plan  did  not  attempt 
to  use  external  economic  policy  as  an  instrument  for  internal 
stabilization.  Brazil  returned  to  its  earlier  and  generally  suc- 
cessful "crawling-peg"  policy,  which  consisted  of  frequent  small 
devaluations  roughly  in  line  with  domestic  inflation.  The  trade 
balance  improved  with  the  fall  in  domestic  demand  resulting 
from  the  Bresser  Plan,  and  a  current-account  balance  was 
attained  by  the  end  of  1987. 

The  improving  external  payments  situation  permitted  some 
modest  liberalization,  beginning  with  a  reduction  of  the  nega- 
tive list  in  September  1987.  Import  financing  requirements 
were  once  again  relaxed,  and  in  late  1988  Cacex  announced  an 
expansion  of  import  program  levels  for  1989.  The  1988 
reforms  also  simplified  the  existing  tariff  system.  Average  rates 
were  lowered  from  over  50  percent  to  about  40  percent.  More- 
over, the  dispersion  or  variability  of  rates  was  reduced;  the 


237 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

highest  tariffs  were  brought  down  from  105  to  85  percent,  and 
the  number  of  different  rates  was  reduced  from  twenty-nine  to 
eighteen.  The  reforms  further  simplified  the  tariff  system  by 
consolidating  the  rules  covering  import  transactions,  reducing 
the  number  of  agencies  directly  involved  in  the  approval  of 
trade  transactions,  and  establishing  greater  automaticity  in  the 
approval  process. 

The  contrast  between  the  favorable  external  payments  situa- 
tion and  Brazil's  internal  deficit  became  even  more  marked  in 
1988,  as  export  value  increased  to  record  levels.  The  favorable 
external  situation  permitted  a  continuation  of  import  liberal- 
ization. In  August  1988,  Cacex  permitted  firms  to  exceed  con- 
siderably  their  programmed  imports  of  capital  and 
intermediate  goods.  Despite  this  modest  relaxation  of  import 
policy,  there  was  no  noticeable  increase  in  total  imports,  which 
actually  fell  slightly  in  1988  from  their  1987  level. 

In  January  1989,  the  government  announced  the  Summer 
Plan,  which  temporarily  froze  wages  and  the  exchange  rate. 
Despite  the  announcement  of  further  fiscal  tightening,  expen- 
ditures declined  little  and  the  budget  deficit  worsened  as  a 
result  of  freezing  prices  for  public-sector  services.  By  mid-1989 
most  other  prices  were  rising  at  more  than  30  percent  per 
month,  ending  the  year  with  a  monthly  rate  of  about  50  per- 
cent. Imports  began  to  increase  significantly  in  mid-1989,  and 
Brazil's  1989  trade  surplus  was  US$16.1  billion,  well  below  the 
record  US$19.2  billion  of  the  preceding  year.  Although  some 
of  the  increase  in  the  level  of  imports  may  be  attributable  to 
the  modest  loosening  of  some  import  controls  in  the  preced- 
ing year,  major  factors  behind  the  worsening  trade  balance 
were  the  recovery  of  industrial  activity  and  increasing  overvalu- 
ation of  the  new  cruzado  (cruzado  novo).  In  late  1989,  the  Cus- 
toms Policy  Council  (Conselho  para  Politica  Aduaneira — CPA) 
issued  Resolution  1,666,  which  further  cut  tariffs.  The  effect  of 
this  change  was  to  reduce  the  average  legal  tariff  from  41  to 
35.5  percent.  Many  of  the  changes  occurred  in  sectors  that  had 
formerly  enjoyed  high  levels  of  protection,  among  them  elec- 
trical equipment,  some  capital  goods,  and  chemicals  (see  table 
16,  Appendix). 

At  the  end  of  the  Sarney  government,  inflation  rates  were  at 
the  threshold  of  hyperinflation,  with  the  monthly  rates  in  the 
first  two  months  of  1990  at  over  70  percent.  Although  the  trade 
balance  had  fallen  to  about  a  third  of  the  levels  of  the  preced- 
ing year,  Brazilian  policy  makers  were  clearly  focused  on  inter- 


238 


The  Economy 


nal  stabilization;  trade  policy  reform  was  a  recognized  but 
secondary  goal. 

Collor  de  Mello  succeeded  Sarney  in  March  1990.  During 
the  election  campaign,  Collor  de  Mello  had  successfully  por- 
trayed himself  as  an  opponent  of  an  intrusive,  interventionist 
bureaucracy.  His  rhetoric,  which  included  attacks  on  corrup- 
tion and  highly  paid  officials  (marajds),  emphasized  deregula- 
tion and  greater  openness  to  world  markets.  The  consequences 
of  this  political  and  ideological  change  for  Brazilian  trade  pol- 
icy were  not  long  in  coming.  One  of  Collor  de  Mello's  early 
moves  was  to  abolish  Cacex,  by  that  time  the  subject  of  wide- 
spread criticism  and  frequent  allegations  of  corruption  by  the 
business  community.  The  Technical  Coordinating  Office  for 
Trade  (Coordenadoria  Tecnica  de  Intercambio  Comercial — 
CTIC),  a  slimmer  and  less  powerful  agency  under  the  Ministry 
of  Economy,  Finance,  and  Planning,  took  over  the  Cacex's 
functions. 

Although  import  licenses  were  not  abolished,  their  approval 
became  a  relatively  routine  operation,  and  by  1991  most 
licenses  were  being  issued  within  five  working  days.  The  CTIC 
became  primarily  a  reporting  and  registration  agency,  which 
had  little  of  the  discretionary  power  formerly  exercised  by 
Cacex.  The  former  CPA,  which  had  been  far  overshadowed  by 
Cacex,  was  replaced  by  an  agency  coequal  with  the  CTIC,  the 
Technical  Coordinating  Office  for  Tariffs  (Coordenadoria  Tec- 
nica de  Tarifas — CTT) .  With  the  shift  in  emphasis  in  trade  pol- 
icy  from  discretionary  administrative  control  to  the 
automaticity  of  published  tariffs,  many  of  them  limited  by  Bra- 
zil's treaty  commitments,  the  CTT's  role  in  formulating  import 
policy  became  significantly  greater  than  the  CPAs  had  been. 

Early  in  1991,  the  Collor  de  Mello  government  announced  a 
series  of  tariff  reductions  to  be  phased  in  over  the  1991-94 
period.  These  were  among  the  most  far-reaching  and  signifi- 
cant reductions  in  Brazilian  trade  protection  in  several 
decades.  Earlier  tariff  reductions  often  had  been  largely  cos- 
metic, only  reducing  rates  that  were  prohibitive  to  high  levels 
that  still  barred  many  imports.  The  1991  reforms  went  much 
further,  and  in  many  sectors  reduced  rates  to  about  a  third  of 
their  level  in  the  early  1980s.  Equally  important,  the  reforms 
reduced  the  wide  variability  or  dispersion  of  tariff  rates  that 
were  once  characteristic  of  Brazilian  trade  policy.  The  overall 
trend  in  Brazilian  trade  policy  is  clear.  By  the  mid-1990s,  Brazil 


239 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

had  become  a  much  more  open  economy  than  it  had  been  a 
decade  earlier. 

Trade  Patterns  and  Regional  Economic  Integration 

Underlying  much  of  the  debate  over  trade  policy  in  Brazil  in 
the  1990s  is  an  implicit  choice  between  regional  trade  arrange- 
ments or  a  more  nonpreferential  policy  that  would  not  discrim- 
inate by  national  origin  or  destination.  Brazil's  most  important 
current  regional  trade  initiative  is  the  Common  Market  of  the 
South  (Mercado  Comum  do  Sul — Mercosul;  see  Glossary). 
With  the  ratification  of  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agree- 
ment (NAFTA;  see  Glossary)  among  Canada,  Mexico,  and  the 
United  States  in  1993,  it  was  inevitable  that  Brazilian  participa- 
tion in  even  larger  regional  trade  arrangements  than  Mercosul 
would  be  discussed  increasingly. 

Despite  the  rhetorical  prominence  of  Latin  American  trade 
in  debate  over  Brazilian  trade  policies,  Brazilian  trade  flows  do 
not  reflect  a  particularly  strong  orientation  to  other  Latin 
American  countries.  However,  with  Mercosul,  other  Latin 
American  countries  may  gain  in  relative  importance.  By  the 
mid-1990s,  trade  with  the  other  Mercosul  partners,  particularly 
Argentina,  was  one  of  the  most  rapidly  growing  sectors  of  Bra- 
zilian foreign  trade. 

In  the  1980s,  Brazilian  exports  to  the  rest  of  South  America 
had  averaged  less  than  10  percent  of  all  exports;  exports  to 
Mexico,  Central  America,  and  the  Caribbean  added  another  2 
percent.  Brazilian  exports  were  directed  overwhelmingly  to  the 
United  States  and  Canada  (about  30  percent)  and  to  Western 
Europe  (about  30  percent). 

Brazilian  export  patterns  in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s  were 
little  different  from  earlier  decades,  when  they  were  also  domi- 
nated by  trade  with  the  United  States  and  with  Europe.  This 
trade  orientation  reflected  several  historical  influences,  includ- 
ing the  structure  of  Brazilian  international  transportation 
channels  and  the  composition  of  Brazilian  exports.  Only  in  the 
1970s  did  Brazilian  exports  shift  from  being  dominated  by  pri- 
mary and  semiprocessed  products  to  manufactures.  Major  mar- 
kets for  all  these  products  were  primarily  in  high-income 
countries;  for  example,  Brazil  long  depended  on  the  United 
States  as  its  major  market  for  coffee.  Other  important  primary 
products,  such  as  sugar,  soybeans,  and  iron  ore,  were  also  sold 
mainly  in  high-income  countries  (see  table  17,  Appendix). 


240 


The  Economy 


Finally,  and  possibly  most  important,  Brazilian  export  pat- 
terns reflected  the  relatively  strong  inward  orientation  of  most 
of  Brazil's  Latin  American  trade  partners  during  most  of  the 
early  post-World  War  II  decades.  The  strong  influence  of  the 
import-substitution  industrialization  doctrines  of  the  Eco- 
nomic Commission  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean 
(ECLAC;  see  Glossary)  in  most  of  the  Latin  American  econo- 
mies in  the  1950s  had  by  the  early  1960s  led  to  extensive 
import-substitution  industrialization,  particularly  in  Brazil  and 
its  larger  trading  partners,  notably  Argentina  and  Mexico.  The 
inevitable  result  was  that  the  more  open  economies  of  Europe 
and  North  America  continued  to  provide  the  most  important 
markets  for  Brazilian  exports.  Only  with  the  concurrent  liberal- 
ization of  trade  in  a  number  of  other  Latin  American  econo- 
mies, especially  Argentina,  did  Brazil's  exports  begin  to  reflect 
the  importance  of  its  Latin  American  trade  partners. 

Brazil's  export  orientation  toward  North  America  and 
Europe  is  also  noticeable  in  its  import  pattern.  In  addition,  the 
Middle  East  is  a  significant  trade  partner  because  of  the  high 
value  of  petroleum  imports.  The  large  trade  deficit  with  this 
region  was  financed  primarily  by  surpluses  with  other  regions, 
notably  the  United  States  and  Europe.  Brazil's  imports  from 
the  rest  of  Latin  America  accounted  for  only  about  12  percent 
of  the  total  value  of  its  imports  in  the  1980s. 

Despite  the  approximately  equal  shares  of  Latin  American 
trade  in  both  Brazil's  exports  and  its  imports,  during  most  of 
the  1980s  Brazil  had  a  large  trade  surplus  with  the  region, 
exceeding  US$800  million  in  most  years.  This  surplus,  which 
was  generated  primarily  in  trade  with  Argentina,  Bolivia,  and 
Paraguay,  helped  finance  Brazil's  oil  imports  from  two  of  the 
region's  oil  exporters,  Mexico  and  Venezuela.  The  value  of  Bra- 
zilian imports  of  petroleum  from  these  countries  was  greatest 
in  the  early  1980s  and  declined  with  the  fall  in  petroleum 
prices. 

Brazilian  attempts  to  expand  formal  regional  trade  agree- 
ments beyond  bilateral  preferential  trading  arrangements  date 
from  1958,  when  the  government  joined  Argentina,  Chile,  and 
Uruguay  in  discussions  that  led  to  the  Treaty  of  Montevideo, 
signed  in  February  1960.  Under  the  treaty,  which  was 
expanded  subsequently  to  most  of  the  economies  of  South 
America  and  to  Mexico,  the  members  agreed  to  negotiate 
mutual  tariff  reductions  on  a  permanent  basis.

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Despite  its  professed  intentions,  the  organization  created  by 
the  treaty,  the  Latin  American  Free  Trade  Association 
(LAFTA — also  known  as  Asociacion  Latinoamericana  de  Libre 
Comercio — ALALC;  see  Glossary)  was  only  a  limited  success. 
Part  of  the  reason  lay  in  the  departures  of  many  of  the  agree- 
ments from  the  nondiscriminatory  provisions  of  Article  24  of 
the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT — see 
Glossary),  which  regulates  regional  trade  agreements. 
Although  the  intent  of  LAFTA  was  to  create  new  trade  rather 
than  to  divert  trade  flows  from  efficient  sources  outside  the 
region,  its  success  in  this  respect  was  minimal.  Another  provi- 
sion of  the  agreement,  which  required  the  formation  of  a  free- 
trade  area  within  a  specified  time  period,  was  ignored.  The 
deadline  for  LAFTA  to  create  such  an  area  was  first  extended 
from  1972  to  1980;  when  the  1980  deadline  was  not  met, 
LAFTA  was  replaced  by  the  Latin  American  Integration  Associ- 
ation (LAIA — also  known  as  Associacao  Latino-Americana  de 
Integracao — ALADI),  which  had  more  modest  goals.  The  real 
blow  to  LAFTA/ ALADI  trade  came  after  1982,  when  interna- 
tional capital  markets  were  closed  to  most  Latin  American  bor- 
rowers following  the  onset  of  Mexico's  external  debt  crisis.  Like 
most  Latin  American  governments,  Brazil  reacted  by  sharply 
restricting  its  imports,  including  those  from  other  ALADI 
members.  As  a  result,  intraregional  trade  fell  significantly  in 
the  first  half  of  the  1980s. 

Argentina  historically  has  been  Brazil's  most  important  Latin 
American  trade  partner  by  a  wide  margin,  both  in  imports 
from  Brazil  and  exports  to  it.  For  this  reason,  virtually  all  Brazil- 
ian regional  trade  initiatives  have  been  based  on  this  bilateral 
trade  relationship.  Well  behind,  and  of  comparable  impor- 
tance, are  Chile,  Mexico,  and  Venezuela.  One  feature  of  Bra- 
zil's regional  trade  is  the  substantial  surpluses  that  it  has  run 
with  several  of  its  neighbors,  among  them  Bolivia,  Colombia, 
and  Paraguay.  In  the  case  of  Paraguay,  this  surplus  may  reflect 
an  underreporting  of  imports  as  a  result  of  the  high  value  of 
contraband  and  unreported  consumer  good  imports  from  Par- 
aguay to  Brazil.  Another  prominent  feature  of  Brazil's  trade 
with  the  rest  of  Latin  America  is  the  importance  of  imports 
from  the  temperate-zone  Southern  Cone  countries.  With  the 
exception  of  the  oil  exporters,  Brazilian  imports  from  other 
tropical  Latin  American  economies  are  relatively  unimportant, 
despite  the  importance  of  several  of  them  as  markets  for  Brazil- 
ian exports.

During  the  1970s,  Brazil's  trade  with  the  United  States,  his- 
torically its  most  important  trade  partner,  declined  in  relative 
importance  as  trade  with  Western  Europe  and  Japan  grew  On 
the  export  side,  this  trend  ended  in  the  early  1980s,  as  the 
United  States  economy  grew  more  rapidly  than  Europe's  and 
the  real  appreciation  of  the  dollar  made  the  United  States  a  rel- 
atively more  attractive  market  in  which  to  sell.  The  tendency 
toward  a  greater  trade  surplus  was  reinforced  by  Brazil's  efforts 
after  1982  to  restrict  imports,  especially  from  traditional  suppli- 
ers like  the  United  States. 

Brazil's  export-led  growth  (see  Glossary)  since  the  1980s  has 
been  oriented  decidedly  toward  the  industrialized  countries. 
As  a  result  of  their  already  large  share  of  Brazil's  export  market 
and  their  rates  of  growth,  the  United  States  and  Canada  were 
responsible  for  nearly  half  of  Brazil's  export  growth  during  the 
late  1980s  and  early  1990s.  Brazil's  most  rapidly  growing  market 
in  the  period  was  the  rest  of  South  America,  with  annual 
growth  exceeding  10  percent.  However,  its  relatively  modest 
initial  share  of  the  Brazilian  export  market  placed  South  Amer-

ica  behind  Asia  and  the  Pacific  and  Western  Europe,  as  well  as 
the  United  States  and  Canada,  in  its  contribution  to  total  Bra- 
zilian export  growth. 

Brazilian  import  growth  in  the  1980s  and  early  1990s  pre- 
sents a  similar  picture.  The  total  value  of  Brazilian  imports  in 
this  period  grew  very  slowly,  as  the  decline  in  the  value  of  oil 
imports  nearly  offset  the  rise  in  the  value  of  imports  from  West- 
ern Europe  and  North  America.  As  was  the  case  with  exports, 
the  industrialized  countries  were  far  more  important  trade 
partners  for  Brazil  than  were  the  less  developed  regions.  Brazil- 
ian imports  from  other  Latin  American  trade  partners  fell  in 
value  after  1983,  as  modest  increases  in  imports  from  the  rest 
of  South  America  and  the  Caribbean  were  more  than  offset  by 
the  fall  in  imports  from  Mexico  and  Central  America. 

Until  the  early  1990s,  both  Brazil  and  Argentina  had  a  tradi- 
tion of  inward-oriented  industrial  policy,  and  it  is  therefore  not 
surprising  that  trade  between  the  two  economies  fell  far  short 
of  its  probable  potential.  The  1986  trade  agreement  between 
Brazil  and  Argentina  was  a  partial  attempt  to  address  this  prob- 
lem and  formed  the  nucleus  of  the  regional  trade  agreement 
for  Mercosul. 

President  Sarney  and  Argentina's  Raul  Alfonsin  (president, 
1985-89)  signed  twelve  protocols  in  July  1986  and  additional 
protocols  in  December  1986.  Most  of  the  protocols  aimed  at 
strengthening  Argentine-Brazilian  economic  cooperation, 
although  cooperation  in  other  areas  also  was  included.  In 
November  1988,  following  extensive  consultations  between  the 
two  governments,  Alfonsin  and  Sarney  signed  the  final  Argen- 
tine-Brazilian Agreement,  which  was  ratified  subsequently  with- 
out modification  by  the  congresses  of  the  two  countries  in 
August  1989. 

Both  governments  hailed  the  agreements  as  major  steps 
toward  economic  integration,  as  well  as  a  Latin  American 
response  to  what  was  perceived  as  the  formation  of  economic 
blocs,  such  as  the  plans  of  the  United  States-Canada  Free  Trade 
Agreement  (FTA)  and  the  European  Community  (EC;  see 
Glossary).  In  reality,  the  protocols  were  more  statements  of 
intention  than  the  detailed  results  of  negotiations  in  the  areas 
covered.  The  Argentine-Brazilian  Agreement  was  a  short,  five- 
page  general  statement  summarizing  the  objectives  of  the  July 
1986  protocols.  Unlike  the  massive  United  States-Canada  FTA, 
it  in  effect  deferred  much  of  the  specific  negotiation  involved 
in  the  agreement's  implementation  to  the  future.  It  was  never- 


244 


The  Economy 


theless  an  ambitious  document,  appearing  to  promise  a  level  of 
cooperation  and  coordination  analogous  to  that  of  the  EC. 

The  Argentine-Brazilian  protocols  signed  between  1986  and 
1988  paved  the  way  for  an  even  more  ambitious  regional  trade 
agreement.  Following  negotiations  with  Uruguay  and  Para- 
guay, the  foreign  ministers  of  the  respective  governments 
agreed  in  March  1991  in  Asuncion,  Paraguay,  to  establish  a 
common  market  among  the  four  countries  by  the  end  of  1994; 
the  Treaty  of  Asuncion,  which  established  Mercosul,  explicitly 
recognized  the  potential  participation  of  additional  members. 
Like  the  earlier  bilateral  Argentine-Brazilian  agreements,  the 
1991  Mercosul  agreements  were  long  on  promises  and  left 
much  for  future  negotiations.  The  agreements  envisioned  a 
full  common  market.  Article  1  of  the  treaty  provides  for  free 
circulation  of  goods,  services,  and  factors  of  production  (see 
Glossary)  among  the  member  countries;  elimination  of  tariff 
and  nontariff  barriers;  establishment  of  a  common  external 
tariff;  coordination  of  policies  in  regional  and  international 
forums;  and  coordination  of  macroeconomic  and  sectoral  poli- 
cies. 

During  the  transition  period  from  1991  through  1994,  the 
accord  called  for  a  progressive  "linear  and  automatic"  reduc- 
tion in  tariffs,  which  was  to  be  accompanied  by  the  elimination 
of  nontariff  barriers  to  trade  among  the  contracting  parties. 
The  December  31,  1994,  target  was  to  be  a  zero  tariff  among 
the  members.  As  more  recent  entrants,  Paraguay  and  Uruguay 
were  given  an  additional  year  to  comply  with  the  terms  of  the 
treaty. 

Compared  with  some  earlier  declarations  of  intent,  the 
Treaty  of  Asuncion  was  considerably  more  specific  about  how 
the  common  market  was  to  be  created.  A  schedule  for  tariff 
reductions  was  established;  cuts  were  to  be  made  at  six-month 
intervals  between  June  30,  1991,  and  December  31,  1994. 
These  reductions  were  to  be  calculated  as  a  percentage  of  the 
lowest  tariffs  applied  to  members  outside  the  Mercosul  group 
and  were  based  on  the  ALADI  tariff  classification. 

Several  other  provisions  of  the  treaty  give  it  a  positive  bias 
toward  greater  economic  openness.  Tariff  reductions  are  based 
on  the  rates  prevailing  before  the  signing  of  the  treaty.  Any 
external  tariff  reductions  that  lower  the  base  from  which  intra- 
Mercosul  tariffs  are  calculated  was  to  apply  to  all  signatories. 
The  treaty  also  contains  a  type  of  "most-favored-nation"  clause, 
which  guarantees  that  any  trade  concession  extended  to  non- 


245 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

members  of  Mercosul  by  any  member  will  be  extended  auto- 
matically by  all  other  contracting  members. 

The  Treaty  of  Asuncion  allowed  each  nation  to  submit  a  list 
of  exceptions  to  the  tariff  reduction  list.  Brazil  and  Argentina 
submitted  324  and  394  tariff  exceptions,  respectively;  Paraguay, 
allowed  439;  and  Uruguay,  960.  Although  it  is  impossible  to 
quantify  the  degree  to  which  these  exemptions  undercut  the 
main  thrust  of  the  treaty,  their  most  important  feature  was  that 
they  were  temporary.  Argentina  and  Brazil  agreed  to  reduce 
their  exception  list  by  20  percent  annually,  while  Paraguay  and 
Uruguay  were  allowed  an  extra  year  (to  the  end  of  1995)  to 
eliminate  their  lists. 

Brazil  and  many  of  its  neighbors  have  tended  to  view  Brazil- 
ian trade  preference  options  as  geographically  defined  and  rel- 
atively local.  Whatever  the  outcome  of  the  Mercosul  regional 
initiative,  the  existing  pattern  of  Brazilian  trade  flows  suggests 
that  Brazil's  long-term  trade  interests  extend  well  beyond  such 
regional  boundaries.  Indeed,  Mercosul  and  the  European 
Union  (EU,  the  former  EC;  see  Glossary)  have  been  discussing 
the  creation  of  a  free-trade  area  between  the  two  groups.  Two 
alternatives  to  Brazil's  South  American-focused  regional  trade 
policy  are  participation  in  a  hemispheric  FTA  or  more  open, 
nonpreferential  trade  with  the  entire  world.  The  former  would 
follow  the  Mexican  example  by  negotiating  Brazil's  entrance 
into  the  NAFTA,  which  is  composed  of  the  United  States,  Can- 
ada, Mexico,  and  potentially,  Chile.  The  second  strategy  is  to 
follow  a  Chilean  approach,  avoiding  preferential  trade  liberal- 
ization and  making  Brazil  more  open  to  all  trade  flows,  what- 
ever their  geographical  source. 

Compared  with  membership  in  an  expanded  NAFTA,  Brazil- 
ian participation  in  Mercosul  represents  a  much  more  modest 
regional  trade  arrangement.  Canada  alone  has  a  larger  GDP 
than  do  all  of  the  Mercosul  economies  combined;  the  four 
Southern  Cone  members  have  a  combined  GDP  totaling  less 
than  10  percent  of  the  total  GDP  of  the  NAFTA  countries. 
Given  recent  rates  of  economic  growth,  this  gap  has  actually 
widened  in  recent  years. 

The  great  disparity  in  the  sizes  of  the  two  regional  trade 
groups  has  a  number  of  implications  for  alternative  Brazilian 
trade  strategies.  Membership  in  the  current  group,  in  which 
Brazil  is  by  far  the  dominant  economy,  offers  political  influ- 
ence and  the  possibility  of  shaping  many  of  Mercosul's  external 
commercial  policies  to  match  Brazilian  trade  objectives.  In 


246 


The  Economy 


many  manufacturing  areas,  Brazil  faces  little  competition  from 
the  other  Mercosul  countries.  If  Brazil  were  to  become  a  mem- 
ber of  the  larger  hemispheric  trade  group  (NAFTA),  the  coun- 
try would  account  for  only  about  5  percent  of  the  association's 
joint  product. 

In  addition  to  the  size  difference  between  Mercosul  and  a 
hemispheric  FTA,  other  features  of  the  two  regional  trade 
arrangements  have  important  cost  and  benefit  implications  for 
Brazil.  The  Treaty  of  Asuncion  is  in  many  ways  more  ambitious 
than  is  NAFTA.  Its  stated  objective  is  the  creation  of  a  true  com- 
mon market  similar  to  the  EU.  In  such  a  regional  trade 
arrangement,  trade  barriers  among  the  member  countries  are 
eliminated  and  external  tariffs  against  third  countries,  fiscal 
policies,  and  exchange-rate  policies  are  integrated. 

Brazilian  participation  in  a  hemispheric  FTA  would  in  prin- 
ciple require  less  coordination  of  fiscal,  monetary,  exchange- 
rate,  and  foreign  capital  policy  than  is  required  by  the  Treaty  of 
Asuncion.  One  may  question  how  seriously  the  Brazilian  gov- 
ernment or  other  Mercosul  members  are  prepared  to  imple- 
ment the  integration  implied  by  a  common  market.  The 
replacement  of  LAFTA  by  ALADI  in  1980  suggests  that  in  the 
choice  between  national  sovereignty  and  the  benefits  of  greater 
economic  integration,  the  former  may  prevail.  But,  if  the 
explicit  commitments  of  the  four  governments  in  the  Treaty  of 
Asuncion  are  to  be  taken  at  face  value,  it  would  appear  that  a 
relatively  high  degree  of  policy  independence  would  be  sacri- 
ficed for  economic  integration  benefits,  which  are  likely  to  be 
considerably  more  modest  than  those  attainable  by  member- 
ship in  a  hemispheric  FTA. 

Another  option  for  Brazil  would  be  to  follow  a  Chilean 
approach  of  greater  trade  openness  on  a  nonpreferential  basis. 
Such  an  approach  has  three  main  advantages,  which  in  princi- 
ple make  it  superior  to  other  trade  strategies.  First,  the  possibil- 
ity that  inefficient  trade  diversion  will  occur  is  eliminated.  The 
lowest  cost  or  most  efficient  producers  would  be  able  to  supply 
Brazil  without  facing  trade  barriers,  because  no  such  producer 
would  be  eliminated  from  among  Brazil's  potential  suppliers 
under  a  nonpreferential  open-trade  policy.  Brazilian  demand 
would  thus  be  supplied  by  the  most  efficient  suppliers  in  the 
world  market,  rather  than  those  in  a  more  restricted  area. 

Second,  a  nonpreferential  approach  in  Brazilian  trade  policy 
would  be  more  easily  administered  because  it  is  in  effect  a  uni- 
lateral policy,  not  dependent  on  negotiations  with  potential 


247 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

trade  partners.  However,  this  approach  may  not  be  perceived  as 
an  advantage  from  a  political  standpoint,  as  it  appears  to  sacri- 
fice Brazil's  "bargaining  chips." 

Third,  a  nonpreferential  strategy  may  better  position  Brazil 
to  respond  to  changes  in  world  markets.  Until  the  mid-1990s, 
Brazilian  trade  had  not  grown  faster  in  the  Mercosul  region 
than  in  other  areas.  In  fact,  the  United  States,  Canada,  Western 
Europe,  and  Asia  all  contributed  more  to  the  growth  of  Brazil- 
ian trade  until  the  mid-1990s  than  did  other  Latin  American 
economies.  Although  Brazilian  membership  in  a  hemispheric 
FTA  might  ensure  greater  access  to  the  United  States,  Canada, 
and  Mexico,  it  would  offer  little  prospect  of  trade  expansion 
with  Europe  or  Asia. 

Economic  Outlook 

Brazil  entered  the  1990s  with  much  less  confidence  about  its 
economic  future  than  it  once  had.  The  economic  stagnation 
and  uncertainty  of  the  1980s  had  exacted  a  high  toll,  and  per 
capita  income  in  1990  was  no  higher  than  it  was  in  1980.  Infla- 
tion, at  monthly  rates,  was  over  30  percent,  unprecedented 
even  by  Brazilian  standards.  It  is  reasonable  therefore  to  ask 
what  has  been  learned  from  the  experience  of  the  1980s  and 
what  are  the  prospects  for  an  economic  future  brighter  than 
the  recent  past. 

As  an  object  lesson,  the  economic  experience  of  the  1980s 
made  a  contribution.  Government  is  much  less  likely  to  be  seen 
as  a  solution,  and  many  more  Brazilians  see  the  public  sector  as 
the  problem.  The  rather  tiresome  debate  between  the  mone- 
tarists and  the  structuralists  that  dominated  discussions  of  infla- 
tion in  thel970s  has  been  superseded  by  a  recognition  that 
money  supply  growth  does  indeed  have  a  close  relation  to  infla- 
tion, but  that  the  underlying  problem  is  the  fiscal  deficit  that 
drives  the  money  supply  process.  Although  the  monetization  of 
deficits  may  be  postponed,  as  was  sometimes  done  in  the  1980s, 
the  inflationary  consequences  of  public-sector  financial  imbal- 
ance cannot  be  avoided  indefinitely.  A  part  of  the  economic 
disorder  of  the  1980s  was  the  consequence  of  populist  attempts 
to  ignore  this  point. 

The  external  shocks  of  the  1980s  have  also  shown  Brazilians 
that  their  country  cannot  be  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the 
world.  By  the  early  1990s,  Brazil  was  on  the  path  to  becoming 
more  open  to  trade  than  it  had  been  for  several  decades. 
Despite  the  loss  of  Brazilian  access  to  world  capital  markets  in 


248

the  early  1980s,  external  capital  was  beginning  to  return  to  Bra- 
zil by  the  early  1990s.  In  contrast  to  the  massive  capital  flows  of 
the  1970s,  much  of  which  financed  public  borrowing,  capital 
flows  in  the  1990s  focused  more  on  the  private  sector. 

Brazilians  also  learned  that  price  stabilization  is  not  easy  and 
that  "magic"  solutions  centered  on  price  freezes  do  not  work 
without  the  more  difficult  fiscal  adjustments  that  emerge  from 
a  political  consensus.  That  consensus  had  not  been  developed 
by  the  early  1990s,  even  though  political  leaders  and  econo- 
mists recognized  that  fiscal  adjustment  was  essential  for  macro- 
economic  stability.  The  failure  of  successive  stabilization  plans 
that  ignored  the  underlying  fiscal  disequilibrium  also  imposed 
long-term  costs,  because  the  credibility  of  government  eco- 
nomic policies  was  undermined.  The  fall  of  the  Collor  de 
Mello  government  in  1992  under  charges  of  massive  corrup- 
tion and  the  economically  unrealistic  provisions  of  the  1988 
constitution  have  made  the  task  of  regaining  government  cred- 
ibility even  more  difficult. 

For  Brazil  to  return  to  the  kind  of  economic  growth  that 
many  of  its  people  once  regarded  as  their  birthright,  a  number 
of  changes  must  occur.  First,  the  public-sector  deficit  must  be 


249 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

reduced  substantially.  This  can  be  done  in  a  number  of  ways 
without  imposing  heavy  costs  on  Brazilian  society.  Privatization 
of  economically  inefficient  state  enterprises  is  one  way,  and  in 
the  first  half  of  the  1990s  some  progress  was  made  in  this  area. 
The  complex  system  of  tax  and  credit  subsidies  that  was  devel- 
oped in  preceding  decades  offers  many  opportunities  for  effi- 
ciency-improving reform,  which  would  also  contribute 
substantially  to  reduction  of  the  fiscal  deficit. 

Second,  Brazil's  recent  moves  toward  becoming  a  more  open 
economy  offer  the  prospect  of  increasing  economic  efficiency 
and  ensuring  that  new  resources  flow  into  activities  in  which 
Brazil  has  a  strong  international  competitive  position.  Decades 
of  protectionism  in  a  number  of  key  sectors  have  imposed  high 
costs  on  Brazilian  consumers.  Greater  openness  to  world  mar- 
kets, either  through  regional  trade  initiatives  or  through  unilat- 
eral reductions  in  trade  restrictions,  will  make  a  noticeable 
contribution  to  Brazilian  economic  welfare. 

Finally,  Brazil  could  become  an  economically  prosperous 
country  if  it  can  seriously  address  the  enormous  inequities  in 
income  distribution.  Serious  efforts  to  help  Brazil's  least  privi- 
leged must  focus  on  the  provision  of  basic  services  and,  above 
all,  on  education.  Without  substantial  efforts  to  address  the 
income  distribution  problem,  the  strains  on  the  political  sys- 
tem that  have  their  economic  counterpart  in  fiscal  disequilib- 
rium may  make  the  country  much  harder  to  govern  and  may 
reduce  the  prospects  for  a  successful  and  sustainable  price  sta- 
bilization.

A  highly  regarded  analysis  of  the  Brazilian  economy's  formu- 
lation from  the  early  colonial  period  to  the  breakdown  of  the 
coffee  economy  in  the  1930s  is  in  Celso  Furtado's  The  Economic 
Growth  of  Brazil.  A  succession  of  external  shocks,  failed  stabiliza- 
tion plans,  and  significant  changes  in  trade  policy  in  the  1980s 
and  early  1990s  provided  the  raw  material  for  literature  on 
recent  Brazilian  economic  problems.  A  classical  treatment  of 
the  1980s  is  Werner  Baer's  The*  Brazilian  Economy — Its  Growth 
and  Development,  the  fourth  edition  of  which  was  published  in 
1995.  Some  of  the  difficulties  in  the  transition  from  a  primary 
product  economy  to  an  important  industrial  power  are  exam- 
ined in  Edmar  L.  Bacha  and  Herbert  S.  Klein's  Social  Change  in 
Brazil,  1945-1985.  A  parallel  treatment  of  some  of  these  prob-

lems  in  Brazilian  economic  development  is  given  in  Luiz  Carlos 
Bresser  Pereira's  Development  and  Crisis  in  Brazil,  1930-1983. 

Brazil's  economic  response  to  the  external  debt  crisis  of  the 
early  1980s  is  the  subject  of  various  studies,  several  of  them 
parts  of  larger  studies  on  a  number  of  developing  nations.  One 
is  Eliana  A.  Cardoso  and  Albert  Fishlow's  The  Macroeconomics  of 
the  Brazilian  External  Debt  Donald  V.  Coes's  Macroeconomic  Crises, 
Policies,  and  Growth  in  Brazil,  1 964-90  provides  a  detailed  mac- 
roeconomic history  of  post-1964  policies  and  their  conse- 
quences. An  earlier  treatment  on  Brazil's  experience  is  James 
Dinsmoor's  Brazil:  Responses  to  the  Debt  Crisis.  A  former  minister 
of  finance,  Marcilio  Marques  Moreira,  provides  an  insider's 
view  of  the  external  debt  problem  in  The  Brazilian  Quandary. 

William  G.  Tyler's  Manufactured  Export  Expansion  and  Industri- 
alization in  Brazil  and  Werner  Baer's  Industrialization  and  Eco- 
nomic Development  in  Brazil  examine  a  number  of  the  causes  and 
consequences  of  import-substitution  industrialization.  A  World 
Bank-sponsored  study  by  Coes,  Liberalizing  Foreign  Trade:  Brazil, 
examines  Brazil's  trade  policies  between  1964  and  the  early 
1980s.  Changes  in  Brazil's  capital  markets  in  this  period  are  the 
subject  of  John  H.  Welch's  Capital  Markets  in  the  Development  Pro- 
cess. Samuel  A.  Morley  examines  Brazilian  labor  markets  and 
income  distribution  in  Labor  Markets  and  Inequitable  Growth:  The 
Case  of  Authoritarian  Capitalism  in  Brazil.  Thomas  J.  Trebat  stud- 
ies the  role  of  state  enterprises  in  Brazil's  State-Owned  Enterprises. 

Among  the  useful  sources  on  the  Brazilian  economy  and  its 
development  that  are  available  only  in  Portuguese  are  A  ordem 
do  progesso,  edited  by  Marcelo  de  Pair  a  Abreu.  Numerous  works 
in  Portuguese  discuss  Brazilian  inflation  and  the  various 
attempts  to  deal  with  it.  Ignacio  Rangel's  A  inflacdo  brasileira  is  a 
classic  work.  Contemporary  treatments  of  stabilization 
attempts  include  Piano  Cruzado  by  Fernando  de  Holanda  and 
Mario  Henrique  Simonsen,  the  latter  a  former  finance  minis- 
ter. 

Data  on  the  Brazilian  economy  are  available  from  a  number 
of  sources,  including  various  Brazilian  economic  journals, 
many  of  high  quality.  Revista  Brasileira  de  Economia,  edited  by 
the  Fundacao  Getulio  Vargas  in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  is  Brazil's  oldest 
and  perhaps  most  conservative  economic  journal.  Estudos 
Econdmicos,  edited  by  the  Economic  School  of  the  University  of 
Sao  Paulo,  is  an  eclectic  journal.  Pesquisa  e  Plane] amento

current  problems  of  the  Brazilian  economy,  is  published  by  the

BRAZIL'S  POLITICAL  EVOLUTION  from  monarchy  to  de- 
mocracy has  not  been  smooth.  Following  independence  in 
1822,  Brazil,  unlike  its  South  American  neighbors,  adopted 
constitutional  monarchy  as  its  form  of  government.  The  new 
nation  retained  a  slave-based,  plantation  economy,  and  politi- 
cal participation  remained  very  limited.  After  the  coronation 
of  Dom  Pedro  II  (emperor,  1840-89)  in  1840,  a  two-party  sys- 
tem based  on  the  British  model — with  conservative  and  liberal 
parties  and  frequent  cabinet  turnovers — evolved.  Within  this 
centralized  unitary  system,  the  emperor  appointed  the  gover- 
nors, using  his  prerogatives  under  the  moderating  power  (poder 
moderador — see  Glossary)  granted  by  the  1824  constitution,  and 
legislative  elections  were  indirect.  Brazil  enjoyed  considerable 
political  stability  until  the  1880s,  when  the  system  proved  inca- 
pable of  accommodating  military  demands  and  pressure  to 
emancipate  slaves. 

Brazil  patterned  the  constitution  of  what  is  now  called  the 
Old  Republic  (1889-1930)  on  the  United  States  constitution. 
However,  colonelism  (coronelismo — see  Glossary),  a  political  sys- 
tem based  on  economic  power  by  large  landowners  in  rural 
areas,  persisted.  Under  the  new  constitution  of  February  24, 
1891,  the  president,  National  Congress  (Congresso  Nacional; 
hereafter,  Congress),  state  governors  and  legislatures,  and  local 
officials  were  chosen  through  direct  elections. 

Following  World  War  I,  when  Brazil  began  to  undergo  rural- 
urban  and  agricultural-industrial  transformations,  its  political 
system  again  was  unable  to  cope  with  the  demands  of  the  urban 
middle  classes  and  especially  the  working  classes.  The  1929 
stock  market  crash  further  exacerbated  the  volatile  situation, 
and  elites  from  the  states  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  and  Minas 
Gerais  staged  a  preemptive  revolution  and  deposed  the  old 
regime.  As  a  result  of  the  revolts  of  1930,  Getulio  Dorneles  Var- 
gas became  president  (1930-1945,  1951-  54). 

Violent  clashes  over  conflicting  ideologies  of  the  left  and  the 
right  erupted  in  the  streets  of  Brazil's  major  cities  in  the  1930s. 
Vargas  tried  to  strike  a  balance  between  the  demands  of  labor 
and  capital  following  Italian  dictator  Benito  Mussolini's  Carta 
di  Lavoro  (see  Glossary)  model  established  in  the  1920s.  The 
1934  constitution  incorporated  this  model  and  thus  began  the 
politics  of  corporatism  (see  Glossary)  in  Brazil.  In  close  cooper- 


255

ation  with  the  military,  Vargas  pushed  for  import-substitution 
industrialization  (see  Glossary)  and  a  reduction  of  military 
forces  under  the  command  of  state  governments,  in  favor  of 
the  Brazilian  Armed  Forces  (Forcas  Armadas  Brasileiras).  Pres- 
ident Vargas  closed  Congress  in  1937  and  ruled  as  a  dictator 
until  1945. 

The  1945-64  period  is  known  for  its  multiparty  democratic 
politics,  and  four  presidents  were  elected  freely  in  1945,  1950, 
1955,  and  1960.  In  the  early  1960s,  an  explosive  combination  of 
slower  economic  growth,  rising  inflation,  populism,  and 
nationalism  produced  political  instability  and  popular  discon- 
tent. The  major  political  parties  lost  their  hegemony,  and  labor 
unions  accumulated  great  political  influence  over  the  govern- 
ment of  Joao  Goulart  (president,  1961-64). 

The  military  seized  power  in  April  1964  and  began  twenty- 
one  years  of  rule.  Under  its  model  of  "relative  democracy," 
Congress  remained  open,  but  with  greatly  reduced  powers. 
Regular  elections  were  held  for  Congress,  state  assemblies,  and 
local  offices.  However,  presidential,  gubernatorial,  and  some 
mayoral  elections  became  indirect.  Political  parties  were 
allowed  to  operate,  but  with  two  forced  realignments.  These 
were  the  replacement  of  the  old  multiparty  system  with  a  two- 
party  system  in  1965  and  a  system  of  moderate  pluralism,  with 
six  (and  later  five)  parties  in  1980.  The  military  regime 
employed  massive  repression  from  1969  through  1974. 

After  the  "economic  miracle"  period  (1967-74),  Brazil 
entered  a  "stagflation"  phase  concurrent  with  political  liberal- 
ization. During  the  military  period,  Brazilian  society  had 
become  70  percent  urban;  the  economy  had  become  industri- 
alized, and  more  manufactured  goods  than  primary  goods 
were  exported;  and  about  55  percent  of  the  population  had 
registered  to  vote.  Foreign  policy  oscillated  between  alignment 
with  the  United  States  and  pragmatic  independence.  A  transi- 
tion to  a  civilian  president  took  place  in  1985.  From  1985  to 
1997,  Brazil  experienced  four  distinct  political  models:  a 
return  to  the  pre-1964  tradition  of  political  bargaining,  clien- 
telism  (see  Glossary),  and  economic  nationalism  under  Jose 
Sarney  (president,  1985-90);  neosocial  liberalism  with  eco- 
nomic modernization  under  Fernando  Collor  de  Mello  (presi- 
dent, 1990-92);  an  erratic  personal  style  of  social  nationalism 
under  Itamar  Franco  (president,  1992-94);  and  a  consensus- 
style  social-democratic  and  neoliberal  coalition  under 
Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso  (president,  1995-  ). 


256 


Government  and  Politics 


Under  heavy  accusations  of  corruption,  President  Collor  was 
impeached  in  1992.  His  vice  president,  Franco,  used  a  prag- 
matic policy  of  "muddling  through,"  but  in  mid-1994  achieved 
great  popularity  with  the  i?m/Plan  (for  value  of  the  real  (R$) — 
see  Glossary),  a  stabilization  program  authored  by  then  Minis- 
ter of  Finance  Cardoso.  In  the  1994  election,  Cardoso  and  the 
Brazilian  Social  Democracy  Party  (Partido  da  Social  Democra- 
cia  Brasileira — PSDB)  expounded  a  social-democratic  model  of 
modernization,  while  Luis  Inacio  "Lula"  da  Silva  of  the  Work- 
ers' Party  (Partido  dos  Trabalhadores — PT)  supported  a 
reworked  model  of  corporatist  or  syndicalist  socialism.  The 
Real  Plan  was  instrumental  in  the  election  of  Cardoso  as  presi- 
dent. 

Cardoso  was  inaugurated  as  president  on  January  1,  1995. 
The  transition  to  the  new  government  was  nearly  perfect.  Car- 
doso had  won  an  outright  victory  in  the  first-round  election. 
He  had  potentially  strong  support  blocs  in  the  Chamber  of 
Deputies  (Camara  dos  Deputados)  and  Federal  Senate 
(Senado  Federal;  hereafter,  Senate).  He  had  strong  support 
from  a  majority  of  the  newly  elected  governors,  including  those 
from  the  important  states  of  Minas  Gerais,  Sao  Paulo,  and  Rio 
de  Janeiro,  which  elected  governors  from  the  president's  own 
PSDB.  Moreover,  the  December  1994  inflation  rate  was  less 
than  1  percent;  unemployment  was  low;  and  popular  expecta- 
tions were  extremely  high. 

Perhaps  the  most  important  task  of  the  Cardoso  government 
in  1995  was  to  promote  the  reform  of  key  sections  of  the  1988 
constitution  in  order  to  reduce  the  role  of  the  state  in  the  econ- 
omy, reform  the  federal  bureaucracy,  reorganize  the  social 
security  system,  rework  federalist  relationships,  overhaul  the 
complicated  tax  system,  and  effect  electoral  and  party  reforms 
to  strengthen  the  representation  of  political  parties.  The  new 
Cardoso  government  initiated  constitutional  reform  (which 
requires  a  three-fifths  majority  of  each  house),  but  soon  met 
with  stiff  congressional  resistance.  Because  of  the  1996  munici- 
pal elections  and  other  political  impediments,  the  other 
reforms — administrative,  social  security,  and  fiscal — were 
stalled  in  Congress,  awaiting  passage  in  1997. 

Political  Culture 

Many  aspects  of  Brazil's  political  system  may  be  explained  by 
its  political  culture  (see  Glossary),  the  origins  of  which  may  be 
found  in  traditional  rural  society  during  the  colonial  and  inde- 


257 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

pendence  periods  through  1930.  This  political  culture  evolved 
into  three  styles  of  politics.  Under  the  more  traditional  style  of 
politics,  coronelismo,  the  local  coronel  (colonel),  in  alliance  with 
other  large  farmers,  controlled  the  votes  of  rural  workers  and 
their  families.  The  local  political  chiefs  in  turn  exchanged 
votes  with  politicians  at  the  state  level  in  return  for  political 
appointments  and  public  works  in  their  municipalities  (munia- 
pios) . 

As  rural-urban  migration  increased  after  1930,  a  transitional 
style  of  clientelistic  politics  emerged  in  medium-size  and  large- 
size  cities.  Under  this  system,  neighborhood  representatives  of 
urban  politicians  would  help  recent  migrants  resolve  their 
problems  in  exchange  for  votes.  These  representatives  were 
usually  from  "clientele  professions,"  such  as  medical  doctors, 
dentists,  and  pharmacists. 

The  third  style  of  mass  politics  involved  a  direct  populist 
appeal  to  the  voter  by  the  politician,  without  formal  intermedi- 
ation by  clientelism  or  domination  by  toronelismo.  Research  in 
the  early  1990s  revealed  that  in  most  cases  voter  decision  mak- 
ing has  been  influenced  by  a  mixture  of  the  second  and  third 
styles,  as  well  as  by  peer  groups,  opinion  leaders,  and  television 
soap  operas  (telenovelas) . 

Polling  results  since  the  early  1970s  have  revealed  changing 
public  opinion  concerning  the  relative  merits  of  military  gov- 
ernment versus  democracy.  For  example,  the  proportion  of 
Brazilians  favorable  to  military  government  decreased  from  79 
percent  in  1972  to  36  percent  in  1990.  Moreover,  70  percent  of 
Brazilians  agreed  in  1990  that  the  government  should  not  use 
troops  against  striking  workers,  as  compared  with  only  7  per- 
cent in  1972.  In  a  March  1995  poll  conducted  by  the  Datafolha 
agency,  however,  only  46  percent  of  Brazilians  responded  that 
"democracy  is  always  preferred  over  dictatorship,"  as  compared 
with  59  percent  endorsing  the  same  proposition  in  March 
1993.  The  relatively  low  crime  rates  during  the  military  period 
may  be  a  factor  in  the  shift  in  public  opinion  regarding  democ- 
racy. 

Brazil  has  a  diversity  of  regional  political  cultures.  Politics  in 
the  states  of  the  Northeast  (Nordeste)  and  North  (Norte)  are 
much  more  dependent  on  political  benevolence  from  Brasilia 
than  are  the  states  of  the  South  (Sul)  and  Southeast  (Sudeste). 
Because  Brazil's  southernmost  state,  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  suf- 
fered three  civil  wars  and  was  involved  frequently  in  political 
conflicts  in  the  Rio  de  la  Plata  areas,  its  population  holds 


258 


Government  and  Politics 


strong  political  loyalties.  As  a  result,  the  Liberal  Front  Party 
(Partido  da  Frente  Liberal — PFL)  and  the  PSDB  have  very  lim- 
ited penetration  in  Rio  Grande  do  Sul.  Both  parties  are  consid- 
ered traitors:  the  PFL  had  splintered  from  the  military  regime's 
Democratic  Social  Party  (Partido  Democratico  Social — PDS)  in 
1984,  and  the  PSDB  had  broken  from  the  Brazilian  Democratic 
Movement  Party  (Partido  do  Movimento  Democratico 
Brasileiro — PMDB)  in  1988. 

In  the  Southeast  state  of  Minas  Gerais,  politics  is  conducted 
in  a  very  cautious,  calculated  manner.  Politicians  there  are 
known  for  their  ability  to  negotiate  and  cut  bargains,  and  they 
have  political  "adversaries"  rather  than  enemies.  In  the  western 
frontier  states,  politics  is  constantly  evolving,  because  of  the 
continuous  inward  migration  from  other  regions.  Most  politi- 
cians and  voters  are  newcomers  with  no  local  political  roots  or 
traditions. 

The  Southeast  states  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Sao  Paulo  have 
received  large  influxes  of  rural-urban  and  north-south  migra- 
tion since  the  1950s.  Because  of  higher  levels  of  industrializa- 
tion, per  capita  income,  labor  union  membership,  and 
education,  the  level  of  political  consciousness  is  higher  in  these 
states  than  in  those  to  the  north  and  west. 

As  a  result  of  intense  rural-urban  migration  since  1960, 
urban  voters  have  increased  from  fewer  than  30  percent  to 
more  than  70  percent  of  the  population  in  1994.  In  1960  only 
22  percent  (15.5  million)  of  Brazil's  population  was  registered 
to  vote;  by  1994  more  than  60  percent  (nearly  95  million)  of 
the  population  was  enfranchised.  The  new  migrants  to  urban 
areas  quickly  enhanced  their  political  consciousness  through 
television,  increased  schooling,  and  membership  in  new  associ- 
ations, such  as  labor  unions. 

Constitutional  Framework 

Brazil  has  had  eight  constitutions  since  independence  in 
1822,  beginning  with  the  constitution  of  March  25,  1824.  The 
republican  constitution  promulgated  on  February  24,  1891, 
was  very  similar  to  the  United  States  constitution,  containing 
separation  of  powers,  checks  and  balances,  a  bicameral  legisla- 
ture, federalism,  and  direct  elections.  Concepts  of  corporatism 
and  centralization  from  Italy  and  Portugal  influenced  the  1934 
and  1937  constitutions.  The  return  to  representative  democ- 
racy in  1945-46  produced  a  more  balanced,  liberal  document, 
which  maintained  a  considerable  role  for  the  state  in  the 


259 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

nation's  economy.  Military  rule  after  1964  forced  an  uneasv  bal- 
ance between  "relative  democracy"  and  the  "safeguards  of  a 
national  security  state."  reflected  in  the  1967  and  1969  constitu- 
tions. 

After  1964  the  government  of  Marshal  Humberto  de  Alen- 
car  Castelo  Branco  (president,  1964-67)  issued  four  institu- 
tional acts  and  a  series  of  complementary  acts  and  decrees  that 
severely  compromised  the  1946  constitution.  Outgoing  Presi- 
dent Castelo  Branco  also  convoked  a  lame-duck  Congress  in 
December  1966  and  January  1967  to  approve  a  new  constitu- 
tion drafted  by  his  legal  team.  The  1967  constitution  removed 
some  important  autocratic  powers  accorded  the  first  military 
president. 

This  1967  constitution  soon  became  an  anathema  to  the  mil- 
itary, and  the  government  of  General  Arthur  da  Costa  e  Silva 
(president,  1967-69)  decreed  the  Fifth  Institutional  Act  in 
December  1968,  which  allowed  the  regime  to  close  Congress 
and  begin  a  third  wave  of  political  purges  (cassafdes).  Before  his 
incapacitating  stroke  in  August  1969,  Costa  e  Silva  and  his  vice 
president,  Pedro  Aleixo,  had  apparently  begun  drafting  a  new 
constitution.  The  fourth  military  president.  General  Ernesto 
Geisel  (president,  1974-79),  decreed  the  end  of  the  Fifth  Insti- 
tutional Act  in  January  1979. 

In  1985,  the  first  year  of  Jose  Sarney's  term,.  Congress 
approved  the  convocation  of  the  National  Constituent  Assem- 
bly (Assembleia  Nacional  Constituinte — ANC)  to  draft  a  new 
constitution.  Elected  on  November  15,  1986,  and  seated  in  Feb- 
ruary 1987,  the  ANC  adopted  a  "from  scratch"  participator^" 
methodology  Using  this  methodology,  the  ANC  divided  itself 
into  eight  committees  and  twenty-four  subcommittees  to  draft 
respective  sections  of  the  document,  and  it  held  public  hear- 
ings on  suggested  content.  After  twenty  months  of  deliberation 
and  two  rounds  of  voting,  the  ANC  produced  the  1988  "citizen 
constitution,"  which  was  promulgated  on  October  5,  1988. 

The  majority  party,  the  PMDB,  was  not  united  during  the 
ANC.  After  the  drafting  committee  produced  a  "progressive " 
first  draft,  the  PMDB's  center  and  right  wings  joined  conserva- 
tives from  other  parties  to  form  the  conservative  coalition,  the 
Big  Center  (Centrao),  in  December  1987,  to  alter  the  internal 
rules  governing  first-round  voting.  The  Big  Center  prevailed 
on  some  crucial  votes,  such  as  maintaining  the  presidential  sys- 
tem and  making  Sarney's  presidential  term  five  years  rather 


260 


Government  and  Politics 


than  four.  However,  plagued  with  absenteeism  it  was  defeated 
in  other  areas,  such  as  the  economic  order. 

The  result  is  a  mixed  document  with  certain  inconsistencies. 
Very  liberal  in  the  section  dealing  with  basic  human  rights,  the 
constitution  also  enhances  "social  rights,"  such  as  retirement 
after  thirty-five  years  of  service,  job  stability  for  public  employ- 
ees, and  four  months  of  paid  maternity  leave.  It  maintains  a 
strong  role  for  the  state  in  the  economy  and  distinguishes 
between  foreign  and  national  capital  enterprises. 

The  ANC  maintained  the  skewed  representational  plan 
favoring  Brazil's  underdeveloped  regions.  It  also  created  three 
very  small  states — Amapa,  Roraima,  and  Tocantins — with  six- 
teen additional  deputies  and  nine  new  senators,  while  granting 
Sao  Paulo  ten  more  deputies.  The  states  have  considerable 
autonomy  in  certain  areas,  such  as  maintaining  state  banks,  but 
the  federal  constitution  is  very  centralized  regarding  election 
of  state  officials,  mandates,  and  government  organization. 

The  ANC  was  able  to  pass  many  controversial  articles  using 
bland  wording  and  a  final  reference  to  "future  regulation  by 
ordinary  legislation."  Some  300  areas  of  the  new  constitution 
were  not  automatically  applicable  and  awaited  such  "regula- 
tion" in  subsequent  legislative  sessions  (1989-90,  1991-92, 
1993-94,  1995-96,  and  1997-98).  Thus,  the  constitution  is 
incomplete. 

The  first  draft  of  the  constitution  was  based  on  a  mixed  par- 
liamentary presidential  model  similar  to  that  of  Portugal  and 
France,  but  a  crucial  vote  taken  on  March  22,  1988,  reinstated 
the  pure  presidential  model.  The  redrafting  to  incorporate  this 
major  change  was  incomplete,  however,  and  several  vestiges  of 
the  mixed  parliamentary  system  remained.  Most  notable  was 
the  provisional  measure  (medida  provisoria — MP),  a  sort  of  tem- 
porary decree,  which  replaced  the  presidential  decree  law. 
Whereas  the  decree  law  took  effect  only  after  thirty  days  of 
inaction  by  the  legislature,  the  MP  takes  effect  immediately. 
Although  the  MP  ceased  to  exist  after  thirty  days  of  legislative 
inaction,  the  president  could  reissue  it  for  successive  thirty-day 
periods.  This  power  was  formidable,  especially  for  a  president 
not  commanding  an  absolute  majority  in  Congress.  In  early 
1997,  however,  the  Senate  approved  an  amendment  extending 
an  MP's  validity  from  thirty  to  ninety  days  but  prohibiting  addi- 
tional extensions  and  the  use  of  MPs  to  create  ministries  or 
other  government  entities.

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

The  1988  constitution  required  each  state  to  rewrite  its  con- 
stitution within  one  year  (during  1989)  and  each  municipality 
to  elaborate  its  Organic  Law  (during  1990),  which  defines  how 
it  operates.  In  1991  the  Federal  District  (Brasilia)  drafted  its 
Organic  Law,  and  the  new  states  of  Amapa,  Roraima,  and 
Tocantins  drafted  their  new  constitutions. 

ANC  members  agreed  that  a  very  detailed  constitution 
would  require  frequent  revisions  to  keep  pace  with  an  ever- 
changing  society  and  economy.  Thus,  Article  3  of  the  transi- 
tional provisions  provided  that  after  five  years  the  Congress 
could  be  converted  into  a  unicameral  assembly  for  constitu- 
tional revision,  deliberating  by  absolute  majority  instead  of  by 
the  three-fifths  margin  in  each  house  normally  required  for  the 
amendment  process.  In  addition,  Article  2  of  the  transitional 
provisions  called  for  a  national  plebiscite  to  decide  on  the  form 
of  government  (republic  or  constitutional  monarchy)  and  the 
system  of  government  (presidential  or  parliamentary).  A  con- 
stitutional amendment  formally  setting  the  plebiscite  for  April 
21,  1992,  passed  the  Chamber  of  Deputies.  However,  in  late 
1991,  during  the  second  round  of  voting  in  the  Senate,  Presi- 
dent Collor  intervened  to  ensure  defeat,  fearing  negative  con- 
sequences for  his  already  beleaguered  government.  The 
plebiscite  was  finally  held  on  April  21,  1993,  and  the  presiden- 
tial republic  was  confirmed  by  a  wide  margin. 

The  revision  of  the  constitution  scheduled  for  late  1993  and 
early  1994  took  place,  but  with  meager  results.  Factors  hinder- 
ing constitutional  revision  included  aftershocks  from  a  con- 
gressional financial  scandal  ("Budgetgate")  exposed  by  the 
Congressional  Investigating  Committee  (Comissao  Parlamen- 
tar  de  Inquerito — CPI);  the  October  3,  1994,  elections;  strong 
pressure  from  nationalist  and  corporatist  groups  in  defense  of 
state  enterprises,  job  stability,  and  national  firms;  and  nonpar- 
ticipatory  methodology  (see  Glossary).  As  of  May  1994,  the 
only  major  change  to  the  constitution  was  to  shorten  the  presi- 
dential term  from  five  to  four  years.  The  next  attempt  to  thor- 
oughly revise  the  1988  constitution  was  begun  in  February 
1995,  but  by  the  regular  amendment  process  (three-fifths 
majority  in  both  houses).  Some  members  would  like  to  use  the 
1998  elections  to  again  convoke  (as  in  1987-88)  a  "constitu- 
tional revision  Congress"  in  1999,  to  do  a  revision  by  a  unicam- 
eral, absolute  majority  (see  Constitutional  Reform,  this  ch.).

Government  and  Politics 


Structure  of  Government 

Brazil  is  a  presidential  and  federative  republic  with  consider- 
able decentralized  federalism.  It  is  composed  of  twenty-six 
states  and  the  Federal  District  (Brasilia).  In  1996  the  states 
were  subdivided  into  5,581  municipalities  (see  fig.  1).  The  sys- 
tem is  built  on  a  directly  elected  president  with  a  national  con- 
stituency and  a  Congress  elected  by  very  parochial  regional 
interests.  Although  the  1988  constitution  reestablished  many  of 
the  prerogatives  of  the  bicameral  Congress,  the  president 
retains  considerable  "imperial"  powers.  The  federal  judiciary 
enjoys  considerable  independence  and  autonomy.  Under  a  sys- 
tem of  checks  and  balances  similar  to  the  United  States  system, 
the  three  branches  of  government  operate  in  harmony  and 
with  mutual  respect.  However,  on  rare  occasions,  one  of  the 
branches  may  challenge  or  reject  the  interference  of  the  oth- 
ers. 

Since  the  end  of  military  rule  in  1985,  unionization,  collec- 
tive bargaining,  and  frequent  strikes  have  become  common- 
place among  federal  employees  in  all  three  branches.  The  1988 
constitution  grants  job  stability  to  all  federal  employees  with 
more  than  five  years  of  service,  including  those  who  had  been 
hired  without  public  examination.  All  new  hiring  must  be  by 
civil  service  examinations,  and  job  stability  comes  after  two 
years  of  probation.  Mandatory  retirement  for  all  public  ser- 
vants, except  for  those  elected  to  political  office,  is  at  age  sev- 
enty. 

In  January  1995,  the  government  employed  (excluding  state 
enterprises)  650,000  civilian  (executive,  586,000;  judicial 
50,000;  and  legislative,  14,000)  and  310,000  military  personnel, 
totaling  960,000.  A  total  of  723,000  were  retired.  State  enter- 
prises counted  another  700,000  active  employees. 

The  Executive 

Executive-branch  reorganizations  are  frequent  in  Brazil,  as 
each  president  seeks  to  impose  his  personal  style  and  to  incor- 
porate political  bargains  struck.  President  Sarney  expanded 
the  cabinet  to  a  record  twenty-seven  ministries.  His  successor, 
President  Collor,  embarked  on  a  massive  reorganization, 
reducing  the  number  of  ministries  to  twelve,  abolishing  many 
agencies,  and  firing  some  80,000  federal  employees.  In  a  reor- 
ganization of  his  cabinet  in  early  1992,  Collor  was  forced  to  dis- 
member several  ministries  to  create  new  positions  in  an  effort 


263 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

to  enhance  political  support.  President  Franco  again  expanded 
the  cabinet  to  twenty-seven  positions  in  October  1992. 

In  January  1995,  President  Cardoso  installed  a  cabinet  with 
twenty-two  ministers  and  the  ministerial-rank  chief  of  the  Civil 
Household  of  the  Presidency  and  implemented  several  impor- 
tant changes  (see  fig.  12).  The  Cardoso  government  charged 
the  new  head  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  with  creating  a  minis- 
try of  defense  by  the  end  of  1995  (a  target  that  was  not  met).  It 
also  granted  three  ministerial  positions — Planning,  Civil 
Household,  and  Finance — superior  status  in  terms  of  coordi- 
nating and  monitoring  the  other  nineteen.  In  addition,  the 
government  also  created  a  Political  Council  (Conselho 
Politico)  to  coordinate  major  political  strategy  and  policy  deci- 
sions. The  council  was  composed  of  the  presidents  of  the  par- 
ties supporting  the  government. 

Since  Joao  Baptista  de  Oliveira  Figueiredo  (president,  1979- 
85),  most  presidents  have  attempted  to  reduce  and  streamline 
the  executive  branch.  President  Sarney  reorganized  the 
Administrative  Department  of  Public  Service  (Departamento 
Administrativo  do  Servico  Publico — DASP),  created  in  the 
1930s,  into  the  Federal  Administration  Secretariat  (Secretaria 
de  Administracao  Federal — SAF),  which  Presidents  Collor  and 
Franco  revamped.  By  1994  the  SAF  had  achieved  moderate  suc- 
cess in  consolidating  the  number  of  diverse  public-service 
career  structures  and  salary  differentials.  Congress  passed  a 
new  executive-branch  civil  service  law,  the  Single  Judicial 
Regime  (Regime  Juridico  Unico — RJU),  in  December  1990.  In 
addition  to  the  large  number  of  state  enterprises  under  govern- 
ment control,  the  executive  branch  also  includes  many  autono- 
mous agencies  and  financial  institutions,  such  as  the  Bank  of 
Brazil  (Banco  do  Brasil)  and  the  Federal  Savings  Bank  (Caixa 
Economico  Federal). 

A  president  must  be  a  native  Brazilian  over  age  thirty-five. 
From  1945  to  1979,  presidents  had  five-year  terms.  Following 
President  Figueiredo's  six-year  term,  the  1988  constitution 
again  set  the  term  at  five  years,  but  the  1994  constitutional  revi- 
sion reduced  the  mandate  to  four  years.  Although  all  of  Brazil's 
constitutions  since  1891  have  prohibited  immediate  reelection 
of  presidents,  governors,  and  mayors,  in  June  1997  Congress 
approved  an  amendment  allowing  reelection.  Thus,  President 
Cardoso  and  the  twenty-seven  governors  may  stand  for  reelec- 
tion in  1998,  and  the  mayors  elected  in  1996  may  be  reelected 
in  2000. 


264 


Government  and  Politics 


The  Brazilian  president  has  the  power  to  appoint  some 
48,000  confidence  positions,  of  which  only  ambassadors, 
higher-court  judges,  the  solicitor  general,  and  Central  Bank 
directors  must  have  Senate  approval.  The  president  may  also 
use  the  line-item  veto,  impound  appropriated  funds,  issue 
decrees  and  provisional  measures,  initiate  legislation,  and 
enact  laws. 

Until  1964  the  president  and  vice  president  were  elected  on 
separate  tickets,  which  produced  incompatible  duos  in  1950 
and  1960.  When  Vargas  committed  suicide  in  1954  and  Janio 
Quadros  (president,  January-August  1961)  resigned  in  August 
1961,  the  actions  of  their  vice  presidents  produced  severe  insti- 
tutional crises,  leading  to  their  respective  ousters  by  military 
intervention.  Since  1964  presidents  and  vice  presidents  have 
been  elected  on  a  single  ticket,  indirectly  until  1989  and  by 
direct  popular  vote  in  1989  and  1994;  a  second  round  takes 
place  if  a  majority  is  needed. 

The  return  to  civilian  rule  in  1985  occasioned  important 
roles  for  vice  presidents.  President-elect  Tancredo  de  Almeida 
Neves  died  before  taking  office,  and  his  vice  president,  Jose 
Sarney,  was  allowed  to  complete  his  term.  After  President  Col- 
lor  was  impeached  in  1992,  his  vice  president,  Itamar  Franco, 
completed  his  mandate.  In  the  event  that  the  president  and 
vice  president  become  incapacitated,  the  line  of  succession  falls 
sequentially  to  the  president  of  the  Chamber  of  Deputies,  the 
president  of  the  Senate,  and  the  president  of  the  Federal 
Supreme  Court  (Supremo  Tribunal  Federal — STF).  If  less  than 
half  of  the  mandate  has  been  completed,  a  supplementary 
election  must  be  called  within  ninety  days.  If  more  than  half 
the  mandate  has  been  completed,  the  Congress  elects  a  new 
president  and  vice  president  within  thirty  days. 

The  Legislature 

Brazil's  national  legislature  is  composed  of  the  513-member 
Chamber  of  Deputies  and  the  eighty-one-member  Senate.  Con- 
gress has  a  basic  four-year  term,  but  senators  serve  for  eight 
years.  It  meets  from  March  through  June,  and  from  August 
through  December.  The  states  have  unicameral  legislatures 
elected  simultaneously  with  Congress.  The  municipalities  have 
city  councils  with  four-year  terms;  municipal  elections  take 
place  two  years  after  state  and  national  elections.  Since  1930 
Congress  has  been  closed  five  times  under  authoritarian  inter- 
vention: November  1930  to  December  1933;  November  1937  to

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

February  1946;  November  1966;  December  1968  to  October 
1969;  and  for  fifteen  days  in  April  1977. 

The  1988  constitution  restored  most  of  the  powers  and  pre- 
rogatives that  Congress  had  lost  during  the  military  regime. 
Congress  enjoys  administrative  and  fiscal  autonomy,  as  well  as 
full  power  over  the  budget.  Under  certain  circumstances,  it 
may  issue  legislative  decrees  not  subject  to  presidential  veto.  An 
absolute  majority  secret  vote  in  Congress  is  required  to  over- 
ride a  presidential  veto.  Congress  also  has  a  very  important  role 
in  setting  national,  especially  economic,  policies.  For  example, 
it  must  approve  all  international  agreements,  including  rene- 
gotiation of  the  foreign  debt. 

Legislators  enjoy  almost  total  parliamentary  immunity,  even 
for  capital  crimes,  such  as  homicide.  Even  if  the  respective 
chamber  lifts  the  legislator's  immunity  by  an  absolute  majority 
secret  vote,  the  legislator  retains  the  privilege  of  being  tried  by 
the  STF.  In  December  1994,  nearly  100  lawsuits  (courts  and 
prosecutors)  sought  to  lift  the  immunity  of  deputies  and  sena- 
tors. However,  the  legislative  esprit  de  corps  is  so  strong  that 
only  rarely  does  a  case  come  to  the  floor  for  a  vote. 

Since  1950  federal  and  state  legislators  have  been  elected  at 
regular  four-year  intervals.  Senators  must  be  at  least  thirty-five 
years  old.  Each  state  has  three  seats,  and  one  or  two  seats  are 
elected  alternately  every  four  years  to  eight-year  terms.  Elec- 
tion is  by  simple  majority.  Since  1946  deputies  have  had  four- 
year  terms  and  must  be  at  least  twenty-one  years  old.  The  1946 
constitution  granted  states  with  small  populations  a  minimum 
delegation  of  seven  deputies;  larger  states  counted  one  addi- 
tional deputy  for  every  150,000  inhabitants  up  to  3  million,  and 
after  that  one  for  every  250,000.  The  small  states  imposed  this 
system  to  reverse  the  dominance  of  the  two  largest  states  (Sao 
Paulo  and  Minas  Gerais)  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  during 
the  Old  Republic  (1889-1930). 

In  1970,  at  the  height  of  the  military  oppression,  the  balance 
was  tipped  in  favor  of  the  larger,  more  developed,  urbanized 
states.  State  delegations  were  calculated  based  on  the  size  of 
the  electorate,  rather  than  on  population.  The  minimum  dele- 
gation was  reduced  to  three,  and  most  of  the  states  in  rural  Bra- 
zil had  their  contingents  cut  in  half.  These  changes  reduced 
the  Chamber  of  Deputies  to  310  deputies.  Ironically,  this  sys- 
tem helped  the  Brazilian  Democratic  Movement  (Movimento 
Democratico  Brasileiro — MDB)  elect  a  44  percent  minority  in 
1974;  thus,  in  1978  the  military  returned  to  calculations  based 


268 


Government  and  Politics 


on  population.  The  1988  constitution  gave  Brazil's  largest  state, 
Sao  Paulo,  seventy  deputies,  instead  of  the  115  it  should  have  to 
be  proportionate  to  its  population. 

Election  of  federal  and  state  deputies  and  city  council  mem- 
bers is  by  proportional  representation.  Brazil  uses  one  of  the 
least-used  variants  of  proportional  representation,  the  open-list 
system  (the  d'Hondt  method — see  Glossary) .  Thus,  there  is  vir- 
tually no  conflict  or  competition  among  parties  in  the  elec- 
tions. The  conflict  is  concentrated  within  each  party  or 
coalition  list,  and  most  deputies  use  their  own  resources  (which 
may  be  considerable,  up  to  US$5  million  for  a  federal  deputy) 
for  campaigning.  Therefore,  they  owe  no  loyalty  to  their  party, 
and  change  labels  frequently  after  their  election  (see  table  18, 
Appendix).  This  produces  very  weak  parties  and  low  cohesion 
in  Congress.  The  Workers'  Party  is  an  exception  to  this  rule. 

Those  holding  office  (elective  or  appointive)  in  the  execu- 
tive branch  who  desire  to  become  candidates  for  elective  office 
must  resign  six  months  before  the  election.  This  requirement 
precludes  a  minister,  governor,  mayor,  or  state  enterprise  direc- 
tor from  using  the  powers  and  resources  of  the  office  to  favor 
his  or  her  election. 

The  Senate  and  Chamber  of  Deputies  have  legislative  initia- 
tive. The  Senate  and  Chamber  of  Deputies  have  six  and  sixteen 
standing  committees,  respectively,  plus  a  joint  budget  commit- 
tee. The  1988  constitution  gives  the  committees  the  power  to 
approve  or  kill  legislation. 

To  override  a  committee  decision  and  bring  the  bill  to  the 
floor  of  the  appropriate  house  requires  a  petition  signed  by  a 
certain  number  of  members.  Once  one  house  passes  a  bill,  the 
other  deliberates  on  it.  If  a  different  version  of  the  bill  is 
passed,  it  returns  to  the  original  house  for  a  final  vote  on  the 
differences.  The  internal  rules  of  each  house  allow  members 
and  party  leaders  certain  prerogatives  of  obstruction. 

Party  leaders  distribute  party  quotas  on  committees  propor- 
tionate to  the  party's  size.  Committee  presidencies  are  appor- 
tioned among  the  parties  on  an  annual  rotational  basis;  thus, 
there  are  no  longstanding  powerful  committee  chairs,  as  in  the 
United  States  Congress.  There  are  no  subcommittees,  and  leg- 
islative committees  rarely  conduct  public  hearings. 

When  a  matter  is  very  serious,  at  least  one-third  of  the 
respective  house  or  the  full  Congress  may  petition  to  initiate  a 
CPI  (Congressional  Investigating  Committee).  The  CPIs  have 
full  subpoena  and  investigative  powers,  such  as  the  disclosure 


269 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

of  bank,  income  tax,  telephone,  credit  card,  and  other  records. 
A  CPI  produced  the  evidence  used  to  impeach  President  Col- 
lor  in  1992  and  uncovered  the  Budgetgate  scandal  of  1993-94. 

Normally,  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  has  around  50  percent 
turnover  at  each  election.  In  1990  this  figure  rose  to  nearly  60 
percent;  in  1994  it  returned  to  54  percent.  In  years  when  two- 
thirds  of  the  Senate  stands  for  election  and  gubernatorial  seats 
are  being  contested,  turnover  can  also  be  high  in  the  upper 
house  (63  percent  in  1994). 

Senators  tend  to  be  older  and  have  more  established  politi- 
cal careers.  Most  have  served  as  federal  deputies,  and  many 
have  been  governors.  Deputies  usually  tend  to  have  served  in 
city  councils,  state  assemblies,  and  as  state  cabinet  secretaries. 
In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  the  proportion  of  deputies  elected 
with  no  prior  political  experience  increased.  In  1995  the  larg- 
est contingents  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  by  occupation 
were  businessmen,  32  percent;  lawyers,  20  percent;  medical 
doctors,  11  percent;  engineers,  7  percent;  labor  leaders,  6  per- 
cent; teachers,  5  percent;  economists,  5  percent;  public  ser- 
vants, 3  percent;  journalists,  3  percent;  and  administrators,  2 
percent. 

Each  house  elects  its  presiding  officers  (one  president,  two 
vice  presidents,  four  administrative  secretaries,  and  four  alter- 
nates) for  two-year  terms.  The  1987-88  ANC  (National  Constit- 
uent Assembly)  prohibited  these  legislative  officers  from  being 
immediately  reelected,  a  prohibition  initially  imposed  by  the 
military  to  break  up  "internal  oligarchies."  Traditionally,  the 
largest  party  in  each  house  has  the  prerogative  of  electing  the 
president,  but  the  PMDB  (Brazilian  Democratic  Movement 
Party)  was  in  such  disarray  in  1993  and  1995  that  the  Liberal 
Front  Party  (Partido  da  Frente  Liberal — PFL),  the  second  larg- 
est party,  was  able  to  build  a  coalition  that  elected  the  Chamber 
of  Deputies  president.  By  negotiation  the  PMDB  returned  to 
the  Chamber  presidency  for  the  1997-98  term,  and  the  PFL 
won  the  Senate  presidency  for  the  first  time  since  1985.  The 
presiding  officers  comprise  an  all-powerful  Executive  Board, 
which  makes  nearly  all  important  political,  administrative,  pro- 
cedural, and  agenda-setting  decisions.  The  Senate  president  is 
also  the  president  of  the  Congress  and  presides  over  joint  ses- 
sions. 

During  the  1987-88  ANC,  an  informal  group  called  the  Col- 
lege of  Party  Leaders  developed.  It  became  an  important  lead- 
ership group  and  was  the  forum  for  decisive  bargaining  on

crucial  articles.  This  group  has  gradually  acquired  more  power 
(especially  agenda-setting)  to  the  detriment  of  the  formally 
elected  officers,  especially  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies. 

The  political  role  of  Congress  began  to  increase  even  before 
the  demise  of  the  military  regime.  In  1979  President 
Figueiredo  took  office  without  the  extraordinary  powers  of  the 
Fifth  Institutional  Act.  In  the  1982  elections,  the  government 
party  lost  its  absolute  majority  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  (see 
table  19,  Appendix),  and  in  1983  the  Chamber  of  Deputies 
defeated  Figueiredo's  initial  decree  laws,  including  one  on 
social  security. 

Maximum  political  power  accrued  to  Congress  in  1985, 
when  the  vice  president-elect,  Jose  Sarney  (PMDB-Maranhao) , 
assumed  the  presidency  under  less  than  auspicious  circum- 
stances. From  March  1985  through  February  1986,  Chamber  of 
Deputies  President  Ulysses  Guimaraes  (PMDB-Sao  Paulo)  and 
PMDB  Senate  floor  leader  Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso 
(PMDB-Sao  Paulo)  more  or  less  ruled  with  Sarney  as  informal 
"prime  ministers."  Sarney,  however,  recovered  considerable 
presidential  powers  as  a  result  of  his  cruzado  (for  value  of  the 
cruzado — see  Glossary)  economic  stabilization  plan,  which 
began  on  March  1,  1986.  Congress  again  assumed  maximum 
power  in  1992,  when  Brazil  became  the  first  nation  in  the  world 
to  constitutionally  impeach  a  sitting,  directly  elected  president. 

The  National  Accounts  Court  (Tribunal  de  Contas  da 
Uniao — TCU)  is  the  external  control  and  oversight  arm  of 
Congress.  The  TCU  conducts  inspections,  usually  following 
newspaper  exposes  or  requests  from  members  of  Congress, 
and  audits  the  executive  branch's  annual  accounts.  Until  the 
1988  constitution,  the  president,  with  Senate  approval, 
appointed  members  to  the  TCU.  Retiring  or  defeated  mem- 
bers of  Congress  or  friends  of  the  president  in  need  of  a  sine- 
cure usually  filled  the  positions.  With  rare  exceptions,  TCU 
members  have  represented  political  factions  and  groups,  and 
their  main  role  is  to  protect  allies  who  have  been  charged  with 
corruption. 

Under  the  1988  constitution,  recruitment  criteria  for  the 
TCU  became  more  specific.  The  president,  with  Senate 
approval,  appoints  three  of  the  nine  members.  Two  of  the  pres- 
idential appointees  must  be  auditors  or  federal  prosecutors 
from  the  TCU  and  must  be  chosen  from  a  three-name  list  pre- 
pared by  the  TCU.  Congress  chooses  the  remaining  six  mem- 
bers. Each  state  has  a  State  Accounts  Court  (Tribunal  de 


272 


Government  and  Politics 


Contas  dos  Estados — TCE),  but  only  the  cities  of  Rio  de  Janeiro 
and  Sao  Paulo  have  a  Municipal  Accounts  Court  (Tribunal  de 
Contas  Municipals — TCM).  The  accounts  of  all  other  munici- 
palities are  reviewed  by  their  respective  TCE. 

The  Judiciary 

The  judicial  branch  is  composed  of  federal,  state,  and 
municipal  courts.  By  1995  small-claims  courts  augmented  some 
municipal  courts.  Only  appointments  to  the  superior  courts 
are  political  and  therefore  subject  to  approval  by  the  legisla- 
ture. The  minimum  and  maximum  ages  for  appointment  to 
the  superior  courts  are  thirty-five  and  sixty-five;  mandatory 
retirement  is  at  age  seventy.  These  federal  courts  have  no  chief 
justice  or  judge.  The  two-year  presidency  of  each  court  is  by 
rotation  and  is  based  on  respecting  seniority. 

The  1988  constitution  produced  five  significant  modifica- 
tions in  Brazil's  judicial  system.  First,  it  converted  the  old  Fede- 
ral Court  of  Appeals  (Tribunal  Federal  de  Recursos — TFR) 
into  the  Superior  Court  of  Justice  (Superior  Tribunal  de 
Justica — STJ).  Second,  it  created  an  intermediate-level 
Regional  Federal  Court  (Tribunal  Regional  Federal — TRF)  sys- 
tem. Third,  the  federal  general  prosecutor  was  given  a  two-year 
renewable  term,  subject  to  confirmation  by  the  Senate,  without 
the  possibility  of  removal  by  the  president.  Fourth,  the  STF 
(Federal  Supreme  Court)  can  issue  a  warrant  of  injunction 
(mandado  de  injuncdo)  to  ensure  rights  guaranteed  by  the  con- 
stitution but  not  regulated  by  ordinary  legislation.  And  fifth, 
the  STF  can  decide  on  matters  of  constitutionality  without  wait- 
ing for  appeals  to  come  through  the  federal  courts. 

The  judiciary  came  under  criticism  during  the  Collor  and 
Franco  administrations.  The  STF  was  harshly  criticized  during 
the  Collor  impeachment  investigation  and  subsequent  trials, 
particularly  for  the  slow  pace  of  the  trials.  In  late  1993,  former 
president  Collor's  appeal  against  the  Senate's  decision  to  strip 
his  political  rights  for  eight  years  ended  in  a  four-four  tie  in  the 
STF.  Three  judges  had  disqualified  themselves:  Collor's  former 
foreign  minister,  Collor's  first  cousin,  and  the  STF  president 
who  had  presided  over  the  Senate  impeachment  trial.  Instead 
of  throwing  the  case  out  after  the  tie  vote,  the  STF  called  three 
substitute  judges  from  the  STJ,  who  broke  the  tie  against  Col- 
lor. 

In  addition,  executive-branch  public  employees  (especially 
in  the  armed  forces)  became  discontented  with  the  STF's  utter 


273

disregard  for  parity  salary  scales  among  the  three  branches  and 
with  government  austerity  targets.  To  address  these  problems 
and  to  streamline  the  judicial  process,  the  1993-94  attempt  at 
constitutional  revision  produced  numerous  proposals  for 
reforming  the  judicial  branch,  including  an  external  control 
body,  the  Penal  Code  (1941),  and  the  1916  Civil  Code  (revised 
in  1973).  Significant  reforms  have  yet  to  be  enacted,  however. 
The  need  for  judicial  reform  in  general  is  widely  recognized 
because  the  current  system  is  inefficient,  with  backlogs  of  cases 
and  shortages  of  judges.  Cases  are  frequently  dismissed 
because  they  are  too  old.  Lawyers  contribute  to  backlogs  by 
dragging  out  cases  as  long  as  possible  because  they  are  paid 
based  on  the  amount  of  time  they  spend  on  a  case.  In  addition, 
STF  jurisprudence  is  not  followed  by  lower  courts.  Some  cor- 
rupt judges  delay  certain  cases  so  that  they  can  be  dismissed. 
Vacancies  on  the  bench  are  difficult  to  fill  because  of  low  pay 
and  highly  competitive  examinations  that  often  eliminate  90 
percent  of  applicants. 

Created  in  October  1890,  the  STF  has  eleven  members 
appointed  by  the  president  with  Senate  approval.  The  STF 
decides  conflicts  between  the  executive  and  legislative 
branches,  disputes  among  states,  and  disputes  between  the 
federal  government  and  states.  In  addition,  it  rules  on  disputes 
involving  foreign  governments  and  extradition.  The  STF  issues 
decisions  regarding  the  constitutionality  of  laws,  acts,  and  pro- 
cedures of  the  executive  and  legislative  branches,  warrants  of 
injunction,  and  writs  of  habeas  corpus.  Further,  it  presents 
three-name  lists  for  certain  judicial-branch  nominations,  and 
conducts  trials  of  the  president,  cabinet  ministers,  and  congres- 
sional and  judiciary  members.  The  president  of  the  STF  is 
third  in  the  line  of  presidential  succession  and  would  preside 
over  an  impeachment  trial  held  by  the  Senate. 

The  TFR  (Federal  Court  of  Appeals)  was  created  under  the 
1946  constitution.  It  initially  had  thirteen  members  but 
expanded  to  twenty-seven  members  in  1979.  In  1988  the  TFR 
became  the  thirty-three-member  STJ  (Superior  Court  of  Jus- 
tice). As  the  last  court  of  appeals  for  nonconstitutional  ques- 
tions, the  STJ  reviews  decisions  of  the  TRFs  (Regional  Federal 
Courts)  and  tries  governors  and  federal  judges.  The  president 
appoints  its  members  with  Senate  approval  on  rotation.  One- 
third  are  picked  from  the  ranks  of  TRF  judges;  one-third  from 
the  ranks  of  State  Supreme  Court  judges;  and  one-third  from 
the  ranks  of  state  and  federal  public  prosecutors. 


274 


Government  and  Politics 


The  1988  constitution  created  five  TRFs — Recife,  Brasilia, 
Rio  de  Janeiro,  Sao  Paulo,  and  Porto  Alegre.  Each  TRF  must 
have  at  least  six  judges,  appointed  by  the  president  and 
approved  by  the  Senate.  One-fifth  must  be  from  among  lawyers 
or  public  prosecutors  with  at  least  ten  years  of  professional 
experience.  Members  must  be  at  least  thirty  years  of  age  but  no 
older  than  sixty-five. 

Brazil's  judicial  system  has  a  series  of  special  courts,  in  addi- 
tion to  the  regular  civil  court  system,  covering  the  areas  of  mili- 
tary, labor,  and  election  affairs.  The  Superior  Military  Court 
(Superior  Tribunal  Militar — STM),  created  in  1808  byjoao  VI 
(king  of  Portugal,  1816-26),  is  the  oldest  superior  court  in  Bra- 
zil. It  is  composed  of  fifteen  judges  appointed  by  the  president 
with  Senate  approval.  Three  members  must  have  the  rank  of 
admiral  in  the  Brazilian  Navy  (Marinha  do  Brasil),  three  must 
be  general  officers  of  the  Brazilian  Air  Force  (Forca  Aerea 
Brasileira — FAB),  four  must  be  army  generals,  and  five  must  be 
civilians.  The  latter  must  be  over  age  thirty  and  under  age  sixty- 
five.  Two  of  the  civilians  are  alternately  chosen  from  among 
military  justice  auditors  and  military  court  prosecutors;  three 
are  lawyers  with  noted  judicial  knowledge  and  ten  years  of  pro- 
fessional experience. 

The  STM  has  jurisdiction  over  crimes  committed  by  mem- 
bers of  the  armed  forces.  It  was  also  used  extensively  to  try  civil- 
ians accused  of  crimes  against  "national  security"  during  the 
military  regime.  States  also  have  military  courts  to  try  cases 
involving  state  Military  Police  (Policia  Militar — PM).  During 
the  constitutional  revision  process  of  1995,  proposals  were 
made  to  close  down  such  courts  at  the  state  level.  These  pro- 
posals were  renewed  in  1997  after  a  series  of  revolts  and  strikes 
by  Military  Police  in  several  states. 

The  government  of  Getulio  Vargas  created  the  Superior 
Electoral  Court  (Tribunal  Superior  Eleitoral — TSE)  in  1932  in 
an  effort  to  end  election  fraud  and  manipulation.  The  TSE  has 
jurisdiction  over  all  aspects  of  elections  and  regulates  the  func- 
tioning of  political  parties.  Its  powers  include  supervising  party 
conventions  and  internal  elections;  granting  or  canceling  regis- 
tration of  parties;  registering  candidates  and  certifying  those 
elected;  regulating  and  supervising  party  access  to  free  televi- 
sion and  radio  time  during  an  election;  and  registering  voters. 
All  states  have  a  Regional  Electoral  Court  (Tribunal  Regional 
Eleitoral — TRE);  larger  cities  have  municipal  election  judges, 
and  smaller  towns  have  local  election  boards. 


275 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

The  TSE  has  seven  members,  each  with  a  two-year  mandate. 
By  secret  ballot,  the  STF  chooses  three  of  its  members  to  sit  on 
the  TSE,  and  the  STJ  chooses  two  of  its  members.  The  presi- 
dent appoints,  with  Senate  approval,  two  lawyers  from  among  a 
six-name  list  submitted  by  the  STF.  The  TSE  elects  its  president 
and  vice  president  from  among  the  members  of  the  STF. 

Since  1950  the  TSE  has  made  important  decisions  affecting 
Brazil's  political  system.  In  1950  and  1955,  the  TSE  decided  in 
favor  of  the  elections  of  presidents  Getulio  Vargas  (1951-54) 
and  Juscelino  Kubitschek  (1956-61)  by  simple  rather  than  by 
absolute  majorities.  In  1980  the  TSE  denied  the  "magic"  label 
of  the  Brazilian  Labor  Party  (Partido  Trabalhista  Brasileiro — 
PTB)  to  the  Leonel  de  Moura  Brizola  faction,  which  was  then 
forced  to  create  the  Democratic  Labor  Party  (Partido 
Democratico  Trabalhista — PDT).  In  1994  the  TSE  prohibited 
noncandidates  from  appearing  on  the  "free  TV  election  hour," 
thus  barring  former  President  Collor  from  participating  in  the 
television  campaign  of  the  National  Reconstruction  Party 
(Partido  da  Reconstrucao  Nacional — PRN) . 

The  system  of  labor  courts  was  created  by  Getulio  Vargas  in 
the  1930s  to  arbitrate  labor-management  disputes,  which  previ- 
ously had  been  settled  by  police  action.  The  1946  constitution 
created  the  Superior  Labor  Court  (Tribunal  Superior  do  Tra- 
balho — TST).  Each  state  has  a  Regional  Labor  Court  (Tribunal 
Regional  do  Trabalho — TRT),  although  Sao  Paulo  State  has 
two  TRTs,  and  each  municipality  has  a  set  of  labor  conciliation 
boards.  The  labor  court  system  has  jurisdiction  over  all  labor- 
related  questions.  It  registers  labor  contracts,  arbitrates  collec- 
tive and  individual  labor  disputes,  recognizes  official  union 
organizations,  resolves  salary  questions,  and  decides  the  legal- 
ity of  strikes. 

The  president  appoints,  with  Senate  approval,  twenty-seven 
judges  to  the  TST.  Seventeen  of  the  judges — eleven  career 
labor  judges,  three  labor  lawyers,  and  three  labor  court  prose- 
cutors— receive  lifetime  terms  (to  age  seventy).  Ten  temporary 
judges  are  appointed  from  lists  evenly  divided  between  the  con- 
federations of  labor  and  management. 

The  Public  Ministry  is  an  important  independent  body  in 
Brazil's  judicial  system.  Its  principal  component,  the  Office  of 
the  Solicitor  General  of  the  Republic  (Procuradoria  Geral  da 
Republica — PGR),  is  composed  of  several  public  prosecutors 
selected  by  public  examination.  The  PGR's  headquarters  is  in 
Brasilia,  and  it  has  branches  in  every  state.  The  PGR  is  charged 


276 


Government  and  Politics 


with  prosecuting  those  accused  of  federal  crimes,  those 
accused  of  offending  the  president  and  his  ministers,  and  all 
federal  officials  and  employees  accused  of  crimes.  Before  1988 
the  president  could  appoint  and  dismiss  the  solicitor  general  at 
will.  Under  the  1988  constitution,  the  solicitor  general  has  a 
fixed,  renewable  two-year  term  and  is  appointed  by  the  presi- 
dent, with  Senate  approval,  among  the  career  prosecutors. 

The  Office  of  the  Federal  Attorney  General  (Advocacia- 
Geral  da  Uniao — AGU),  which  was  separated  from  the  PGR  by 
the  1988  constitution,  defends  the  federal  government  against 
lawsuits  and  provides  legal  counsel  to  the  executive  branch. 
The  AGU  was  organized  and  staffed  under  a  provisional  mea- 
sure (MP)  issued  by  President  Franco. 

Each  state  has  a  State  Supreme  Court  (Tribunal  de  Justica — 
TJ).  The  governor,  with  approval  by  the  State  Assembly  (Assem- 
bleia  do  Estado),  appoints  the  judges  to  the  court.  This  court 
has  the  prerogative  of  appointing  special  state  circuit  judges  to 
deal  with  agrarian  problems.  In  addition,  it  is  responsible  for 
organizing  and  supervising  the  lower  state  courts.  Each  state  is 
divided  into  district  courts  ( comarcas) . 

State  and  Local  Governments 

Since  independence  Brazil  has  oscillated  between  centraliza- 
tion and  state  autonomy.  During  the  empire  (1822-89),  Brazil 
had  a  centralized  constitutional  monarchy  and  little  state 
autonomy.  The  emperor  exercised  the  moderating  power  by 
appointing  senators  for  life,  presiding  over  a  Council  of  State, 
removing  and  transferring  police  and  judicial  officials  at  will, 
and  appointing  provincial  governors. 

The  Old  Republic  was  established  in  1889  in  part  because  of 
state  demands  for  greater  autonomy.  Until  1930  the  larger  and 
more  powerful  states  enjoyed  great  autonomy  under  a  federal 
system  patterned  after  the  United  States  model,  but  the  smaller 
and  poorer  states  constantly  suffered  interventions  by  the  cen- 
tral government.  "Young  Turk"  lieutenants  ( tenentes)  rebelled 
against  this  system  of  state  oligarchies  in  the  1920s  and  were 
prominent  in  the  initial  modernization  strategies  after  the 
1930  revolution.  From  1930  to  1945,  the  national  government 
centralized  control  over  state  and  local  governments  by 
appointing  governors,  who  in  turn  appointed  all  mayors. 
Except  for  the  brief  period  of  1933-37,  the  national  govern- 
ment closed  legislatures  at  all  levels.  The  1946  constitution 
reestablished  a  more  balanced  federalism,  but  maintained  cen- 


277 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 


tral  control  over  industrial,  financial,  labor,  election,  and  devel- 
opment policies.  In  October  1965,  the  military  regime  began 
curtailing  the  autonomy  of  the  states  once  again.  From  1966 
through  1978,  the  central  government  appointed  state  gover- 
nors and  mayors  of  state  capitals  and  some  170  designated 
selected  cities  deemed  vital  to  "national  security."  Active-duty 
army  colonels  were  appointed  as  security  chiefs  in  each  state. 
As  part  of  its  "liberalizing  opening,"  the  military  regime 
allowed  direct  elections  for  governors  in  1982.  In  November 
1985,  President  Sarney  and  Congress  allowed  direct  elections 
for  mayors  of  state  capitals  and  selected  cities  deemed  vital  to 
"national  security." 

Until  1994  state  governors  and  vice  governors  were  elected 
to  one  four-year  term,  taking  office  on  January  1  following 
their  election.  In  1998  those  elected  in  1994  may  seek  one  con- 
secutive second  term.  State  deputies  are  also  elected  to  four- 
year  terms  but  are  not  restricted  to  one  term.  Governors  have 
state  cabinets,  and  their  executive  branch  is  organized  in  a 
manner  similar  to  the  federal  executive  branch.  Likewise,  state 
assemblies  organize  their  legislative  process  like  that  of  Con- 
gress. After  1988  state  assemblies  lost  their  salary  autonomy; 
state  deputies  may  receive  up  to  75  percent  of  the  salary  of  a 
federal  deputy. 

State  governments  are  responsible  for  maintaining  state 
highway  systems,  low-cost  housing  programs,  public  infrastruc- 
ture, telephone  companies,  and  transit  police.  Both  state  and 
municipal  governments  are  responsible  for  public  primary  and 
secondary  schools  and  public  hospitals.  Municipal  govern- 
ments are  also  responsible  for  water,  sewerage,  and  garbage  ser- 
vices. State  tax  revenues  are  concentrated  in  sales  taxes.  State 
governments  are  allowed  to  operate  state  financial  institutions, 
most  of  which  are  a  constant  problem  for  the  Central  Bank 
because  they  run  heavy  deficits,  especially  in  election  years.  In 
1995  the  Central  Bank  intervened  in  some  of  the  state  banks 
with  the  worst  deficits  (Sao  Paulo,  Rio  de  Janeiro,  Alagoas,  and 
Mato  Grosso)  and  sought  to  privatize  others.  In  October  1996, 
Brazil  had  5,581  municipalities,  of  which  more  than  15  percent 
had  populations  under  5,000.  The  municipal  taxing  authority 
is  concentrated  on  property  and  service  taxes. 

Mayors  and  vice  mayors  must  be  at  least  twenty-one  years  of 
age  and  are  elected  to  one  four-year  term.  Reelection  is  now 
permitted  as  of  the  year  2000.  City  council  members  must  be  at 
least  eighteen  years  of  age  and  are  elected  to  renewable  four- 


278 


Government  and  Politics 


year  terms  under  a  proportional  representation  system.  From 
1950  through  1970,  municipal  elections  coincided  with  general 
federal  and  state  elections.  Local  officials  elected  in  1970  were 
given  two-year  terms,  so  as  to  set  local  elecdons  two  years  out  of 
phase  with  general  elections  (the  next  local  elections  were  held 
in  1972  and  1976).  However,  local  officials  elected  in  1976  were 
given  six-year  terms  to  make  municipal  elections  again  coin- 
cide with  general  elections  in  1982,  but  in  turn  the  latter  also 
got  six-year  terms  to  make  local  elections  out  of  phase  again  (in 
1988,  1992,  and  1996). 

The  Political  Party  System 

Historical  Origins  and  Evolution 

Shortly  after  Brazil's  independence,  the  first  political  groups 
emerged  with  either  pro-Brazilian  or  pro-Portuguese  factions. 
During  the  second  empire  period  (1831-89),  the  Conservative 
and  Liberal  parties  alternated  in  power,  and  an  embryonic 
Republican  Party  appeared  in  1870.  During  the  Old  Republic 
(1889-1930),  sections  of  the  Republican  Party  in  the  larger 
states  held  political  power.  During  the  brief  opening  of  repre- 
sentative politics  between  1934  and  1937,  attempts  were  made 
to  organize  national  parties. 

After  1945,  when  parties  and  elections  again  were  permitted, 
local  factions  in  the  interior  that  had  been  allied  with  the  Var- 
gas government  since  1930  organized  the  Social  Democratic 
Party  (Partido  Social  Democratico — PSD);  the  pro-Vargas 
groups  in  urban  areas  organized  the  PTB  (Brazilian  Labor 
Party) ;  and  all  those  opposed  to  Vargas  initially  formed  the 
UDN  (National  Democratic  Union).  The  PSD  elected  the  pres- 
ident and  an  absolute  majority  to  the  1946  Constituent  Assem- 
bly. The  Brazilian  Communist  Party  (Partido  Comunista 
Brasileiro — PCB),  led  by  Luis  Carlos  Prestes,  operated  freely 
from  1945  through  1947,  but  the  STF  (Federal  Supreme 
Court)  canceled  its  registry  in  early  1948. 

By  1960  Congress  had  thirteen  parties.  Confronted  with 
adverse  results  in  the  direct  gubernatorial  elections  of  October 
1965,  President  Castelo  Branco  (1964-67)  decreed  the  end  of 
this  multiparty  system  and  imposed  a  two-party  system.  His 
objective  was  to  organize  a  strong  majority  support  party  and  a 
loyal  opposition.  Thus,  the  National  Renewal  Alliance  (Alianca 
Renovadora  Nacional — Arena)  and  the  MDB  (Brazilian  Demo- 
cratic Movement)  were  born. 


279 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

About  90  percent  of  the  UDN,  50  percent  of  the  PSD,  and  15 
percent  of  the  PTB  joined  Arena.  Although  it  held  an  absolute 
majority  in  Congress  until  its  demise  in  1979,  Arena  was 
plagued  with  regional  and  former  party  factionalism.  The  MDB 
suffered  from  ideological  factionalism  regarding  the  military 
government;  the  factions  divided  among  the  authentics  (those 
most  strongly  opposed  to  the  military  government),  the  neo- 
authentics,  and  the  moderates. 

As  a  result  of  the  voting  trends  of  the  1974,  1976,  and  1978 
elections,  which  channeled  protest  votes  to  the  MDB,  General 
Golbery  do  Couto  e  Silva,  the  architect  of  much  of  the  regime's 
political  evolution  from  1964  until  his  retirement  in  August 
1981,  called  for  a  party  realignment  to  achieve  broader  politi- 
cal maneuvering  space  for  the  government.  A  survey  con- 
ducted among  members  of  Congress  in  March  1979  showed 
that  nearly  three-fourths  of  Arena  and  two-thirds  of  the  MDB 
desired  a  multiparty  system.  In  December  1979,  Congress 
approved  government-sponsored  legislation  abolishing  Arena 
and  the  MDB  and  permitting  moderate  party  pluralism. 

Initially,  the  realignment  strategy  was  successful.  The  MDB 
became  the  PMDB  (Brazilian  Democratic  Movement  Party)  but 
with  half  its  1979  size.  Arena  became  the  PDS  (Democratic 
Social  Party),  and  retained  its  majority  position.  MDB  moder- 
ates and  Arena  liberals  organized  the  government  auxiliary 
Popular  Party  (Partido  Popular — PP)  led  by  Senator  Tancredo 
Neves  and  Deputy  Magalhaes  Pinto.  Former  deputy  Ivette  Var- 
gas and  former  governor  Leonel  Brizola  resurrected  the  PTB; 
and  the  new,  more  militant  labor  unions  organized  the  Work- 
ers' Party. 

In  May  1980,  this  pluralism  became  less  moderate  when,  in  a 
highly  political  decision,  the  TSE  (Superior  Electoral  Court) 
decided  to  give  the  PTB  label  to  Ivette  Vargas  instead  of  Bri- 
zola, who  had  much  broader  organizational  support  within  the 
party.  Undaunted,  Brizola  immediately  organized  the  PDT 
(Democratic  Labor  Party)  and,  in  1982,  was  elected  governor 
of  Rio  de  Janeiro,  with  twenty-three  deputies  versus  Ivette  Var- 
gas's thirteen  (see  table  19,  Appendix).  Because  of  the  harsh 
1982  election  rules  imposed  by  the  Figueiredo  government, 
the  Popular  Party  decided  to  dissolve  itself  and  reincorporate 
with  the  PMDB,  which  greatly  strengthened  the  latter  in  many 
states,  especially  in  Minas  Gerais  and  Parana. 

In  1985  Congress  passed  legislation  easing  the  requirements 
for  organizing  new  parties;  thus,  the  ANC  (National  Constitu- 


280 


Government  and  Politics 


ent  Assembly)  seated  eleven  parties  in  1987,  nineteen  in  1991, 
and  eighteen  in  1995.  With  the  exception  of  the  Workers' 
Party,  traditionally  all  Brazilian  political  parties  have  been  orga- 
nized from  the  top  down,  with  a  compact  group  of  professional 
politicians  making  major  decisions.  The  party  system  suffered 
considerable  fragmentation  during  the  late  1980s  and  early 
1990s,  especially  because  of  an  exodus  from  the  largest  par- 
ties— PMDB  and  PFL  (Liberal  Front  Party) — after  1988,  similar 
to  the  factionalization  in  the  1950s  and  early  1960s.  In  1987  the 
five  largest  parties  accounted  for  92.8  percent  of  the  Chamber 
of  Deputies.  In  1989  this  figure  fell  to  70.1  percent,  and  in  1992 
it  fell  further  to  61.4  percent.  However,  after  the  1994  elections 
a  "reconcentration"  occurred,  and  by  1997  the  five  largest  par- 
ties accounted  for  83.6  percent. 

In  addition  to  strong  internal  cleavages,  parties  differ 
regionally.  The  Popular  Party  was  almost  totally  concentrated 
in  Minas  Gerais  and  Rio  de  Janeiro.  Initially,  Brizola's  PDT  was 
concentrated  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul — the 
two  states  that  had  elected  him  in  the  1947-64  period — but 
later  expanded  to  more  states  and  elected  three  governors  in 
1990  (see  table  20,  Appendix).  The  Workers'  Party  remains 
concentrated  in  Sao  Paulo  but  has  expanded  to  other  states  in 
the  South  and  North.  The  PSDB  (Brazilian  Social  Democracy 
Party)  is  highly  concentrated  in  Ceara  and  Sao  Paulo.  The  PFL 
has  always  been  concentrated  in  the  Northeast.  In  Rio  Grande 
do  Sul,  the  PFL  and  the  PSDB  have  very  limited  penetration 
(see  Political  Culture,  this  ch.). 

Major  Parties  in  Congress 

In  1995  eight  political  parties,  constituting  89.7  percent  of 
the  total  membership  of  the  Chamber  of  Deputies,  were  con- 
sidered major  parties.  Each  held  more  than  5  percent  of  the 
Chamber.  In  1997  the  seven  significant  parties  totaled  92.6  per- 
cent. 

Progressive  Renewal  Party 

The  Progressive  Renewal  Party  (Partido  Progressista  Renova- 
dor — PPR)  was  organized  by  the  fusion  of  the  PDS  (Demo- 
cratic Social  Party)  and  the  Christian  Democratic  Party 
(Partido  Democratico  Cristao — PDC)  in  April  1993.  After  the 
Workers'  Party,  the  PPR  has  the  most  consistent  ideology.  It 
generally  supports  the  interests  of  business  and  rural  landlords. 
It  has  a  radical  position  in  favor  of  privatization,  economic 


281

modernization,  and  reduction  of  the  state's  role  in  the  econ- 
omy. In  1994  the  PPR  elected  three  governors,  two  senators, 
and  fifty-three  federal  deputies.  The  PPR  contributed  one  min- 
ister (health)  to  Cardoso's  cabinet,  but  the  party  does  not  auto- 
matically support  government  positions  in  Congress.  In  1995 
Paulo  Maluf  remained  the  main  leader  of  the  PPR,  which 
attempted  to  form  a  bloc  with  the  Progressive  Party.  In  mid- 
September  1995,  Maluf  merged  the  PPR  with  the  Progressive 
Party  to  form  the  Brazilian  Progressive  Party  (Partido  Progres- 
sista  Brasileiro — PPB). 

Brazilian  Democratic  Movement  Party 

The  Brazilian  Democratic  Movement  (Movimento 
Democratico  Brasileiro — MDB),  the  political  opposition  to  the 
military  regime,  began  mobilizing  national  support  in  the  late 
1970s.  Like  the  PTB  (Brazilian  Labor  Party)  in  the  early  1960s, 
the  MDB  was  on  the  verge  of  becoming  a  mass  political  party 
when  Congress  dissolved  it  in  1979.  The  party  president,  Dep- 
uty Ulysses  Guimaraes,  convinced  the  party  to  "add  a  P  to  the 
MDB"  to  preserve  the  hard-fought  opposition  image. 

The  Brazilian  Democratic  Movement  Party  (Partido  do 
Movimento  Democratico  Brasileiro — PMDB)  won  nine  gover- 
norships in  1982  and  elected  Tancredo  Neves  in  the  electoral 
college  of  January  1985  in  alliance  with  the  PFL.  The  centrist 
PMDB  advanced  to  become  the  "catch-all,  rainbow"  party, 
electing  a  majority  to  the  ANC  (National  Constituent  Assem- 
bly), and  all  but  one  governor  in  1986.  Overloaded  with  joiners 
(many  of  whom  migrated  from  the  Arena/PDS),  the  PMDB 
acquired  a  more  conservative  profile,  provided  a  base  for  the 
Big  Center  in  the  ANC,  and  projected  an  image  of  close  collab- 
oration with  the  Sarney  government.  These  tendencies  pro- 
voked the  exodus  of  the  more  progressive  members,  such  as 
the  PSDB,  in  1988.  The  party  was  less  successful  in  the  congres- 
sional and  gubernatorial  elections  in  1988  and  1990,  but  made 
a  slight  comeback  in  the  1992  municipal  elections. 

In  1994  the  PMDB's  presidential  candidate,  former  governor 
Orestes  Quercia,  placed  fourth.  Nevertheless,  the  PMDB  man- 
aged to  elect  nine  governors  and  remained  the  largest  party  in 
Congress,  electing  fourteen  senators  and  107  federal  deputies. 
The  PMDB  had  two  important  ministries  (transport  and  jus- 
tice), plus  the  Secretariat  of  Regional  Development  (now  sub- 
ordinate to  the  Ministry  of  Planning)  in  the  Cardoso 
government.  With  the  defeat  of  Quercia  and  the  loss  of  Sao 


282

Paulo  State,  the  party  has  no  coherent  national  leadership,  and 
the  support  of  its  sizable  congressional  delegation  is  uncertain. 
In  1997  the  PMDB  became  the  second  largest  party  in  Con- 
gress, losing  its  first-rank  position  to  the  PFL. 

Liberal  Front  Party 

A  manifesto  signed  by  three  governors,  ten  senators,  and 
sixty  federal  deputies  in  December  1984  officially  launched  the 
center-right  Liberal  Front  Party  (Partido  da  Frente  Liberal — 
PFL).  In  the  January  15,  1985,  electoral  college,  the  PMDB-Lib- 
eral  Front-PDS  ticket  of  Tancredo  Neves  and  Jose  Sarney 
received  the  votes  of  102  federal  deputies,  fifteen  senators,  and 
fifty-one  delegates  still  nominally  affiliated  with  the  PDS.  In 
1985  the  PFL  became  the  second  largest  party  in  Congress.  It 
received  a  mere  8.8  percent  of  the  votes  in  the  municipal  elec- 
tions of  November  1985,  but  when  Sarney  was  able  to  reform 
the  cabinet  inherited  from  Tancredo  Neves  in  February  1986, 
the  PFL  received  six  ministries.  In  1992  the  PFL  elected  nearly 
1,000  mayors,  second  only  to  the  PMDB. 

Although  the  PFL  is  noted  for  its  neoliberal  ideology,  it  is 
always  predisposed  to  pragmatic  bargaining,  such  as  in  1994, 


283 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

when  it  abstained  from  running  its  own  presidential  candidate 
and  joined  with  the  PSDB  and  PTB.  Although  it  elected  only 
two  governors,  it  remained  the  second  largest  party  in  Con- 
gress, electing  eleven  senators  and  eighty-nine  federal  deputies 
(57  percent  from  the  Northeast),  in  addition  to  the  vice  presi- 
dent. In  Congress  the  PFL  is  known  to  have  the  most  articulate 
and  cohesive  delegation,  on  a  par  with  the  Workers'  Party.  As  a 
Cardoso  coalition  partner,  the  PFL  received  three  ministries  in 
1995.  It  became  the  first-ranked  party  in  1997. 

Brazilian  Labor  Party 

The  Brazilian  Labor  Party  (Partido  Trabalhista  Brasileiro — 
PTB),  a  pre-1964  leftist  party,  was  resurrected  as  center-rightist 
in  1980.  Two  factions — one  led  by  Leonel  Brizola  and  the  other 
led  by  Ivette  Vargas — vied  for  leadership  of  the  PTB.  Although 
twenty  of  the  twenty-three  federal  deputies  who  originally 
joined  the  PTB  were  brizolistas,  Ivette  Vargas  was  allied  with 
General  Golbery  do  Couto  e  Silva,  chief  of  Ernesto  Geisel's 
Civil  Household  of  the  Presidency,  who  pressured  the  TSE 
(Superior  Electoral  Court)  to  give  the  label  to  Vargas's  pro-gov- 
ernment faction  in  May  1980. 

The  PTB  elected  thirteen  deputies  in  1982  and  became  the 
junior  member  in  a  coalition  with  the  PDS  to  give  the  latter  a 
majority  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies.  In  1986  the  PTB  elected 
seventeen  federal  deputies,  and  in  1990  it  elected  two  gover- 
nors, four  senators,  and  thirty-eight  federal  deputies.  The  party 
became  a  convenient  election  vehicle  for  politicians  without 
space  in  the  larger  parties. 

In  1994  the  PTB  formed  a  coalition  with  the  PFL  and  PSDB 
in  support  of  Cardoso's  candidacy.  In  that  election,  the  PTB 
elected  one  governor,  three  senators,  and  thirty-one  federal 
deputies — a  slightly  worse  record  than  in  1990.  In  1995  the 
PTB  remained  loyal  to  its  coalition  with  the  PSDB  and  PFL  in 
support  of  the  Cardoso  government  and  occupied  two  minis- 
tries. 

Democratic  Labor  Party 

Brizola  founded  the  social  democratic-oriented  Democratic 
Labor  Party  (Partido  Democratico  Trabalhista — PDT)  in  May 
1980  after  losing  the  PTB  label  to  Ivette  Vargas.  Over  the  ensu- 
ing fifteen  years,  many  PDT  members  migrated  to  other  par- 
ties. In  1990  the  PDT  elected  three  governors  (Brizola 
included),  five  senators,  and  forty-seven  federal  deputies  and 


284 


Government  and  Politics 


became  the  third  largest  party  in  Congress.  In  1994  Brizola 
placed  fifth  for  president  and  was  defeated  by  Eneas  Carneiro 
in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  thus  ending  his  forty-seven-year  political 
career.  The  PDT  elected  only  two  governors,  four  senators,  and 
thirty-three  federal  deputies  that  year. 

Despite  his  massive  defeat  in  1994,  Brizola  refused  to  relin- 
quish personal  control  of  the  party  and  tried  to  impose  a  sys- 
tematic opposition  posture  on  the  congressional  delegation, 
although  the  two  PDT  governors  favored  a  more  flexible  posi- 
tion vis-a-vis  the  Cardoso  government.  Both  the  very  dynamic 
governor  of  Parana,  Jaime  Lerner,  and  Dante  de  Oliveira,  gov- 
ernor of  Mato  Grosso,  left  the  PDT  in  1997. 

Workers'  Party 

The  Workers'  Party  (Partido  dos  Trabalhadores — PT),  the 
country's  first  independent  labor  party,  is  a  unique  party  in 
Brazil.  Organized  externally  (outside  Congress)  from  the  grass- 
roots up  and  based  on  the  new  trade  unionism  in  Sao  Paulo  in 
1979,  the  Workers'  Party  initially  did  not  want  any  professional 
politicians  or  students  in  its  ranks.  However,  to  have  a  voice  in 
Congress  it  accepted  five  deputies  and  one  senator  into  its 
ranks  in  early  1980.  Since  then  the  Workers'  Party  has  grown 
steadily,  doubling  its  Chamber  of  Deputies  delegation  in  1982, 
1986,  and  1990,  while  tripling  the  number  of  its  state  deputies 
at  each  election,  except  in  1994.  It  has  also  won  mayorships  in 
several  cities,  including  Sao  Paulo  (1988)  (see  Elections,  1988- 
96,  this  ch.). 

The  Workers'  Party  is  divided  into  six  factions  along  a  left- 
right  continuum.  The  right  consists  of  Radical  Democracy 
(Democracia  Radical),  which  has  a  social-democratic  orienta- 
tion. The  center  consists  of  Unity  and  Struggle  (Unidade  e 
Luta),  Catholic  militants,  and  members  of  the  right  wing  of 
Lula  da  Silva's  former  Articulation  (Articulacao)  faction.  The 
left  consists  of  Option  of  the  Left  (Opcao  de  Esquerda),  which 
is  divided  into  two  subgroups — Hour  of  Truth  (Hora  da  Ver- 
dade),  the  dissident  left  wing  of  the  former  Articulation  group, 
former  Stalinists,  and  Castroites;  and  Socialist  Democracy 
(Democracia  Socialista),  the  largest  Trotskyite  group,  which 
existed  before  the  Workers'  Party.  The  extreme  left  consists  of 
Workers'  Party  in  the  Struggle  (Na  Luta  PT),  which  is  divided 
into  two  subgroups — Socialist  Force  (Forca  Socialista),  whose 
members  are  former  militants  from  extreme  left  guerrilla 
groups  from  the  1960s:  the  People's  Electoral  Movement 


285 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

(Movimento  Eleitoral  do  Povo — MEP)  and  Popular  Action 
(Acao  Popular — AP);  and  The  Work  (O  Trabalho),  consisting 
of  Trots kyites  from  two  student  movements  of  the  1970s — Free- 
dom (Liberdade)  and  Struggle  (Luta). 

Until  1993  Lula's  moderate  Articulation  group  had  a  large 
absolute  majority  in  the  Workers'  Party.  This  group  conducted 
pragmatic  coalition-building  in  the  1990  and  1992  elections, 
which  resulted  in  the  election  of  increasing  numbers  of  depu- 
ties and  city  council  members.  However,  in  1993  the  extreme 
left  and  left  elected  an  absolute  majority  (53  percent)  of  the 
national  party  directorate,  took  control,  and  imposed  stricter 
criteria  for  coalition-building  at  the  state  level.  In  1995  and 
1997,  the  Articulation  faction  was  again  elected  to  the  party 
presidency. 

Brazilian  Social  Democracy  Party 

A  center-left  group  of  the  PMDB  (Brazilian  Democratic 
Movement  Party)  organized  the  Brazilian  Social  Democracy 
Party  (Partido  da  Social  Democracia  Brasileira — PSDB)  in  June 
1988.  Many  of  these  PMDB  members  were  associated  with  the 
Progressive  Unity  Movement  (Movimento  de  Unidade  Progres- 
sista — MUP).  They  had  become  discontented  with  the  rainbow 
party,  with  the  PMDB's  participation  in  the  conservative  Big 
Center  during  the  National  Constituent  Assembly,  and  espe- 
cially with  the  politics  of  President  Sarney.  The  principal  lead- 
ers of  the  new  party  were  from  Sao  Paulo,  including  Senator 
Cardoso  (PMDB  floor  leader  in  the  Senate). 

The  PSDB  adopted  a  modernizing,  social-democratic  pro- 
gram and  favored  a  parliamentary  system  of  government.  In 
1988  it  became  the  third  largest  delegation  in  Congress, 
although  it  elected  only  eighteen  mayors  that  year  (including 
Belo  Horizonte). 

The  PSDB  occupied  three  ministries  in  the  Franco  cabinet, 
including  Senator  Cardoso  at  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs. 
In  May  1993,  Cardoso  moved  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  where 
he  launched  the  Real  Plan  for  economic  stabilization  in  March 
1994.  With  other  major  parties  already  engaged  in  different 
presidential  alliances,  the  PSDB  opted  for  a  coalition  with  the 
more  conservative  PFL  and  PTB  in  the  1994  elections.  The 
adoption  of  the  new  Real  currency  and  the  resulting  near-zero 
inflation  greatly  boosted  Cardoso's  presidential  candidacy  in 
July  and  August  and  guaranteed  his  first-round  victory  with  a 
margin  of  54.3  percent  on  October  3.  The  PSDB  also  elected 


286 


Government  and  Politics 


six  governors  (including  Ceara,  Minas  Gerais,  Sao  Paulo,  and 
Rio  de  Janeiro),  nine  senators,  and  sixty-two  deputies,  a  much 
better  performance  than  in  1990  (see  General  Elections,  1994, 
this  ch).  The  Social  Democrats  occupied  six  ministries,  includ- 
ing the  powerful  ministries  of  Planning,  Finance,  and  Civil 
Household  of  the  Presidency,  in  the  Cardoso  government. 

Progressive  Party 

The  Progressive  Party  (Partido  Progressista — PP)  grew  out  of 
the  PTR  (Workers'  Renewal  Party).  In  1990  the  PTR  and  the 
Social  Workers'  Party  (Partido  Social  Trabalhista — PST)  had 
elected  just  two  federal  deputies  each.  The  new  Progressive 
Party  had  thirty-seven  deputies  in  1993,  and  by  1994  had  grown 
to  forty-five,  the  fifth  largest  delegation  in  the  Chamber  of  Dep- 
uties. In  1995  the  Progressive  Party  became  leaderless,  with  no 
clear  political  strategy.  Thus,  it  merged  with  the  PPR  (Progres- 
sive Renewal  Party)  to  form  the  PPB  (Brazilian  Progressive 
Party) . 

Minor  Parties  in  Congress 

In  1995  eleven  smaller  parties  were  represented  in  Congress, 
of  which  five  are  noteworthy. 

Liberal  Party 

Deputy  Alvaro  Valle  (PDS-Rio  de  Janeiro)  founded  the  cen- 
ter-right Liberal  Party  (Partido  Liberal — PL)  in  1985.  Dubbed 
the  businessman's  Workers'  Party,  the  Liberal  Party  rapidly  sup- 
planted the  Liberal  Front  Party  (Partido  da  Frente  Liberal — 
PFL)  in  Sao  Paulo.  In  the  elections  of  November  15,  1986,  the 
Liberal  Party  secured  seven  seats  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies 
and  one  in  the  Senate.  It  received  4.8  percent  of  the  national 
vote  in  1990  and  elected  fifteen  deputies.  On  taking  their  seats 
in  February  1991,  the  new  Liberal  Party  deputies  joined  the 
opposition  bloc  against  Collor.  In  1994  the  Liberal  Party 
elected  no  governors,  one  senator,  and  thirteen  deputies. 

Party  of  National  Reconstruction 

Created  in  February  1989  by  a  takeover  of  the  Youth  Party  as 
an  election  vehicle  for  Collor's  candidacy,  the  conservative 
Party  of  National  Reconstruction  (Partido  da  Reconstrucao 
Nacional — PRN)  immediately  received  twenty  deputies  and 
two  senators.  After  Collor's  election,  the  party  increased  its  con- 


287 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

gressional  delegation  in  1990,  but  had  a  dismal  performance  in 
the  October  3  elections  that  year:  forty  deputies  and  only  7  per- 
cent of  the  vote,  and  no  governors.  In  1994  the  party,  reduced 
to  four  deputies  and  four  senators,  elected  one  federal  and  two 
state  deputies. 

Brazilian  Socialist  Party 

Resurrected  in  1986  from  the  pre-1964  Socialist  Party,  the 
left-wing  Brazilian  Socialist  Party  (Partido  Socialista 
Brasileiro — PSB)  elected  seven  representatives  to  the  ANC 
(National  Constituent  Assembly).  It  joined  the  Brazilian  Popu- 
lar Front  (Frente  Brasil  Popular — FBP)  coalition  in  1989  in 
support  of  Lula,  and  again  in  1994.  With  2.3  percent  of  the 
national  vote  in  1990,  the  PSB  elected  eleven  deputies,  includ- 
ing twice  governor  of  Pernambuco  Miguel  Arraes,  PSB  presi- 
dent. The  PSB,  which  has  a  more  pragmatic  socialism  than  the 
Workers'  Party,  contributed  two  ministers  to  Franco's  cabinet. 
In  1994  the  PSB  elected  two  governors  (including  Arraes),  one 
senator,  and  fifteen  federal  deputies. 

Brazilian  Communist  Party 

In  1993  the  Brazilian  Communist  Party  (Partido  Comunista 
Brasileiro — PCB),  in  a  stormy  national  convention  led  by  its 
president,  Deputy  Roberto  Freire,  removed  Marxist-Leninist 
doctrine  from  the  party  statutes  and  the  hammer  and  sickle 
from  its  flag,  and  changed  its  name  to  the  PPS  (Popular  Social- 
ist Party).  The  original  PCB  had  been  organized  in  1922.  At 
Moscow's  initiative,  Luis  Carlos  Prestes  took  over  the  PCB's 
leadership  in  the  mid-1930s.  Prestes  presided  over  the  party 
until  the  early  1980s,  when  he  was  ousted  by  a  renovated  Euro- 
communist  faction  that  had  tired  of  his  Stalinist  line.  During  its 
illegal  period  (1948-85),  the  PCB  was  able  to  elect  a  few  of  its 
members  under  other  party  labels.  The  PCB  regained  legal  reg- 
istry in  1985,  elected  three  representatives  to  the  ANC  in  1986, 
and  again  in  1990,  always  in  coalitions.  Deputy  Freire  carried 
the  PCB  banner  as  candidate  for  president  in  1989,  and 
became  floor  leader  of  the  Franco  government  in  1992.  In 
1994  the  PPS  joined  the  FBP  in  support  of  Lula  and  elected 
one  senator  (Freire)  and  only  two  federal  deputies. 

Communist  Party  of  Brazil 

The  Communist  Party  of  Brazil  (Partido  Comunista  do  Bra- 
sil— PC  do  B)  was  created  as  an  underground  splinter  from  the 


288 


Government  and  Politics 


PCB  in  1958,  following  Soviet  leader  Nikita  Khrushchev's 
denunciations  of  Stalinist  atrocities.  The  PC  do  B  repudiated 
the  new  Moscow  line  and  aligned  itself  with  Maoism.  When  the 
People's  Republic  of  China  began  making  economic  reforms  in 
1979,  the  PC  do  B  aligned  itself  with  Albania.  When  Albania 
held  its  first  free  elections  in  1992,  the  PC  do  B  became  non- 
aligned.  After  the  PC  do  B  was  legalized  in  1985,  under  the 
leadership  of  former  deputy  and  former  guerrilla  Joao  Amazo- 
nas,  it  elected  more  deputies  in  1986  and  1990  than  its  arch 
rival,  the  PCB.  The  PC  do  B  joined  the  FBP  in  support  of  Lula 
in  1989  and  1994.  The  PC  do  B  doubled  its  delegation  from 
five  to  ten  federal  deputies,  representing  nine  states,  in  1994. 
This  feat  resulted  from  PC  do  B  domination  of  student  organi- 
zations in  most  states  and  astute  use  of  coalitions. 

Regional  Strength  of  the  Parties 

Within  the  basic  government  coalition — the  PFL  (Liberal 
Front  Party),  the  PSDB  (Brazilian  Social  Democracy  Party), 
and  the  PTB  (Brazilian  Labor  Party) — the  PFL  is  highly  con- 
centrated in  the  Northeast  (Bahia  and  Pernambuco),  and  the 
PSDB  to  a  lesser  degree  in  the  Southeast  (Sao  Paulo  and  Minas 
Gerais) .  Almost  half  of  the  PSDB  deputies  elected  in  the  North- 
east came  from  Ceara;  the  PTB  elected  only  two  deputies  from 
the  Northeast. 

Those  formally  opposed  to  the  new  Cardoso  government, 
led  by  the  Workers'  Party  and  PDT,  are  concentrated  in  the 
South  and  Southeast.  The  Workers'  Party  became  the  second 
largest  delegation  in  the  states  of  Sao  Paulo  and  Rio  Grande  do 
Sul  in  1994,  and  slightly  expanded  its  delegations  in  the  North, 
Northeast,  and  Center-West  (Centro-Oeste)  regions.  Although 
reduced  from  its  1990  size,  the  PDT  remained  the  largest  dele- 
gation in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  but  fell  to  fourth  rank  in  Rio  Grande 
do  Sul,  after  the  PMDB  (Brazilian  Democratic  Movement 
Party),  Workers'  Party,  and  PPR  (Progressive  Renewal  Party). 

The  PSB  (Brazilian  Socialist  Party)  is  highly  concentrated  in 
the  Northeast;  nearly  half  of  its  fifteen  deputies  come  from  Per- 
nambuco. The  PC  do  B  (Communist  Party  of  Brazil)  is  the  only 
small  party  to  have  elected  deputies  in  all  five  regions  of  Brazil 
in  1994.  It  presents  a  very  dispersed  pattern,  with  ten  deputies 
elected  in  nine  states.  The  PC  do  B  dominated  student  associa- 
tions (university  and  high  school)  in  almost  all  states  and  was 
able  to  mobilize  these  young  voters  to  concentrate  their  prefer- 
ences on  one  or  two  PC  do  B  candidates  in  each  state.

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

The  delegations  of  the  four  parties  considered  potential 
allies  of  the  government  are  mostly  concentrated  in  the  North, 
Center-West,  and  South.  In  1994  the  PMDB's  two  largest  dele- 
gations came  from  the  Southeast  (thirty-two)  and  Northeast 
(thirty).  Nonetheless,  the  PMDB  was  weakened  in  those 
regions  in  the  1994  elections,  even  though  it  elected  four  of 
the  nine  Northeastern  governors  (Piauf,  Rio  Grande  do  Norte, 
Alagoas,  and  Paraiba). 

As  a  result  of  its  electing  three  of  the  seven  governors  in  the 
North,  the  PPR  elected  the  second  largest  delegation  from  that 
region.  Its  second  regional  concentration  was  in  the  South, 
where  it  was  tied  with  the  Workers'  Party  with  twelve  deputies. 
The  PPR  became  the  second  largest  delegation  in  Rio  de  Jan- 
eiro with  seven  deputies.  Leading  defeated  coalitions  in  the 
runoffs  in  Goias  and  Brasilia,  the  Progressive  Party  became  the 
second  largest  delegation  in  the  Center-West,  after  the  PMDB. 
Its  best  performances  at  the  state  level  were  in  Minas  Gerais 
(seven  deputies)  and  in  Parana  (six  deputies). 

Party  Legislation 

Because  Congress  did  not  pass  a  new  organic  law  for  political 
parties  in  1994,  political  parties  until  1995  were  regulated  by  a 
patchwork  quilt  of  legislation:  the  1988  constitution,  the  old 
Organic  Law  imposed  by  the  military,  and  a  host  of  individual 
laws  passed  over  the  past  twenty  years,  including  Election  Law 
No.  8,713,  passed  on  September  30,  1993.  Parties  are  consid- 
ered part  of  public  law,  and  the  state  regulates  and  supervises 
them  closely.  Although  Article  17  of  the  1988  constitution 
states  that  parties  are  free  to  organize,  fuse,  incorporate,  or  dis- 
solve themselves,  Paragraph  2  of  the  same  article  states  that 
after  parties  acquire  a  "legal  personality"  under  civil  law  they 
may  then  register  their  statutes.  Although  Paragraph  1  states 
that  parties  are  free  to  organize  themselves  internally,  in  reality 
they  are  governed  by  a  detailed,  complex,  and  often  conflicting 
set  of  legal  rules. 

After  1985  provisional  organization  of  new  parties  became 
easier:  101  members  of  the  party  sign  a  petition  with  bylaws, 
statutes,  and  a  program,  which  are  registered  with  the  TSE 
(Superior  Electoral  Court).  Definitive  registry  is  more  compli- 
cated; within  a  twelve-month  period,  the  new  party  must  orga- 
nize state  directorates  in  nine  states  and  in  one-third  of  the 
municipalities  in  each  of  these  states.

Government  and  Politics 


In  late  August  1995,  Congress  finally  passed  the  new  Organic 
Law  of  Political  Parties,  which  had  been  under  consideration 
since  1989.  This  law  imposed  stiffer  criteria  for  the  registration 
of  new  parties,  stated  that  party  switchers  might  lose  their  man- 
date, and  established  a  "weak"  threshold  of  3  percent  for  pro- 
portional elections  (parties  with  less  than  3  percent  of  the  valid 
vote  would  not  be  allowed  to  operate  in  Congress,  but  those 
elected  would  be  seated).  Continuous  party  switching  has  been 
a  problem  in  Congress.  In  the  first  five  months  of  the  1995  leg- 
islature (February  through  June),  more  than  forty  federal  dep- 
uties (8  percent)  switched  party  labels  at  least  once. 

On  the  final  deadline  date  of  October  2,  1995,  Law  No. 
9,100  was  passed  and  published  in  the  daily  record;  it  regulated 
the  municipal  elections  of  October  3,  1996.  Some  minor 
changes  were  enacted:  a  20  percent  quota  for  female  candi- 
dates for  city  councils;  less  transparency  in  campaign  finance 
than  in  1994;  very  high  limits  for  campaign  contributions  (up 
to  US$221,000.00  for  businesses  and  US$51,500.00  for  individ- 
ual persons);  and  a  return  to  the  1990  rules  on  free  radio/tele- 
vision  time.

Sarney's  Presidency,  1 985-90 

The  government's  strategy  of  controlling  the  election  of  the 
first  civilian  president  in  the  1985  electoral  college  almost 
received  a  mortal  blow  on  April  25,  1984.  On  that  day,  the  dire- 
tas  jd!  constitutional  amendment,  which  called  for  direct  elec- 
tions for  president  on  November  15,  1984,  came  just  twenty-two 
votes  shy  of  the  necessary  two-thirds  majority  (320  votes).  In 
late  June  1984,  the  Liberal  Front  dissident  group  split  from  the 
military  government's  PDS  (Democratic  Social  Party)  and 
joined  the  PMDB  led  by  Governor  Tancredo  Neves  (Minas 
Gerais).  In  the  second  half  of  1984,  massive  rallies  engulfed 
Brazil,  as  the  Tancredo  Neves-Sarney  ticket  consolidated  its 
300-vote  margin  over  Paulo  Maluf  (PDS-Sao  Paulo)  in  the  Janu- 
ary 1985  electoral  college. 

Sarney  got  his  start  in  politics  in  his  home  state  of  Maranhao 
in  the  late  1950s  as  federal  deputy  in  the  progressive  wing  of 
the  National  Democratic  Union  (Uniao  Democratica  Nacio- 
nal — UDN).  A  staunch  supporter  of  the  1964  revolution,  he 
was  able  to  defeat  the  PSD  (Social  Democratic  Party)  political 
machine  in  direct  elections  for  governor  in  1965,  and  was 


291

elected  senator  by  Arena  (National  Renewal  Alliance)  in  1970. 
The  military  government  never  quite  accepted  Sarney  and 
vetoed  his  attempts  to  return  to  the  governorship  in  1974  and 
1978.  He  was  also  passed  over  several  times  for  the  presidency 
of  the  Senate  and  for  the  post  of  minister  of  justice  in  1980.  As 
a  consolation  prize,  he  became  president  of  the  PDS.  In  1984 
Sarney  was  one  of  the  dissident  leaders  of  the  schism  in  the 
PDS,  and  he  became  Tancredo  Neves's  running  mate. 

Tancredo  Neves  took  ill  on  the  eve  of  his  inauguration  on 
March  14,  1985,  and  died  on  April  21.  Sarney  was  first  sworn  in 
as  vice  president  and  then  acting  president  within  a  very  loose 
interpretation  of  the  constitutional  norms  for  presidential  suc- 
cession. 

Deputy  Ulysses  Guimaraes  had  been  elected  president  of  the 
Chamber  of  Deputies  on  February  1  and  by  right  should  have 
assumed  the  presidency  because  neither  Tancredo  Neves  nor 
Sarney  had  been  inaugurated.  On  the  death  of  Tancredo 
Neves,  a  new  indirect  election  should  have  been  called  within 
ninety  days.  Guimaraes,  perhaps  sensing  that  the  military 
would  not  accept  this  scenario,  graciously  declined  in  favor  of 
Sarney. 

Sarney's  first  year  was  very  difficult.  He  was  unprepared  to 
assume  the  presidency  and  was  assisted  immediately  by  General 
Ivan  Souza  Mendes,  director  of  the  National  Intelligence  Ser- 
vice (Servico  Nacional  de  Informacoes — SNI).  In  effect,  Bra- 
zil's government  was  an  informal  parliamentary  system  during 
1985,  with  Deputy  Guimaraes  and  PMDB  Senate  floor  leader 
Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso  acting  as  informal  prime  minis- 
ters. The  Sarney  administration  moved  to  consolidate  repre- 
sentative democracy  in  1985:  it  legalized  the  two  communist 
parties,  the  PCB  and  the  PC  do  B,  allowed  illiterates  to  vote, 
and  called  for  direct  elections  for  mayors  of  all  capital  cities 
and  "national  security"  municipalities. 

The  PMDB  performed  poorly  in  the  November  15,  1985, 
mayoral  elections,  when  former  president  Janio  Quadros  of  the 
PTB  (Brazilian  Labor  Party)  narrowly  defeated  Cardoso  for 
mayor  of  Sao  Paulo.  However,  Sarney  recovered  national  pres- 
tige and  high  standing  in  the  polls  following  the  introduction 
of  the  Cruzado  Plan  on  February  28,  1986,  and  began  to  con- 
solidate his  power  as  president.  The  PMDB  became  the  great 
"umbrella"  party  in  the  1986  elections,  leading  a  broad  coali- 
tion to  victory  in  all  states  but  Sergipe,  and  electing  an  absolute 
majority  in  the  ANC  (National  Constituent  Assembly). 


292 


Government  and  Politics 


Rapid  consolidation  of  democracy  in  Brazil  after  1985  was  in 
part  slowed  by  some  of  the  concessions  negotiated  by  Tancredo 
Neves  with  the  military  to  ensure  their  support.  Tancredo 
Neves  agreed  that  members  of  the  armed  forces  who  had  been 
expelled  for  subversion  after  1964  would  not  receive  amnesty 
and  reinstatement;  that  there  would  be  no  independent,  non- 
congressional  Constituent  Assembly;  and  that  before  the  new 
constitution  was  finished  and  promulgated,  none  of  the 
authoritarian  decrees — National  Security  Law,  antistrike  law, 
repressive  press  law,  and  limitations  on  Congress — would  be 
canceled  or  modified. 

By  October  1988,  Sarney,  who  was  still  a  nominal  member  of 
the  PMDB,  had  grown  very  unpopular  because  of  increasing 
inflation  and  allegations  of  corruption.  As  a  result,  the  PMDB 
lost  many  cities  in  the  November  15,  1988,  municipal  elec- 
tions— of  the  100  largest  cities,  the  party  dropped  from  seventy- 
seven  to  twenty  mayors,  but  in  1992  elected  twenty-nine;  in 
1996  the  number  fell  back  to  only  sixteen  (see  table  21,  Appen- 
dix). In  addition,  impeachment  proceedings  were  initiated 
against  Sarney  on  charges  of  corruption.  The  CPI  (Congres- 
sional Investigating  Committee)  reported  in  favor  of  impeach- 
ment, but  the  measure  was  not  transmitted  to  the  floor  of  the 
Chamber  of  Deputies  for  deliberation. 

During  Sarney's  presidency,  Brazil  suffered  four  austerity 
shock  plans  and  used  three  currencies.  Thus,  for  the  Decem- 
ber 17,  1989,  runoff,  voters  selected  the  two  presidential  candi- 
dates who  most  vociferously  criticized  the  Sarney  presidency — 
Collor  (PRN)  and  Lula  (Workers'  Party). 

Collor  de  Mello's  Presidency,  1990-92 

Collor  created  extremely  high  expectations  that  he  could 
solve  Brazil's  economic  problems  and  that  he  could  insert  Bra- 
zil into  the  international  economic  arena.  With  one  "silver  bul- 
let," he  promised  to  rid  Brazil  of  inflation,  rampant  corruption, 
and  all  marajds  (literally  maharajahs,  or  do-nothing,  corrupt 
high  government  officials  who  draw  huge  salaries),  while  mod- 
ernizing Brazil's  economy  and  society. 

Collor's  ambitious  program  began  by  confiscating  some 
US$50  billion  in  financial  and  bank  assets  from  depositors  and 
investors,  thereby  plunging  the  country  into  recession.  He  set 
about  "taking  the  state  apart,"  announcing  that  he  would 
reduce  the  number  of  federal  civilian  employees  from  nearly  1 
million  to  300,000.  Further,  he  would  auction  off  government 


293 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

cars  and  housing  in  Brasilia,  sell  all  state  enterprises,  and  begin 
a  program  to  consolidate  or  eliminate  the  myriad  of  federal 
agencies.  Collor's  style  of  presidency  was  similar  to  that  of 
developed  countries  and  included  well-orchestrated  public 
relations  campaigns  and  lavish  entertaining. 

Although  he  commanded  a  small  minority  bloc  in  Congress, 
Collor's  high  ratings  in  the  polls  and  excellent  television  com- 
munication skills  dissuaded  many  politicians  from  opposing  his 
unusual  proposals  in  an  election  year.  Unlike  the  Cruzado 
Plan,  which  had  helped  Collor's  election  as  governor  of  Ala- 
goas  in  1986,  his  1990  stabilization  plan  did  not  produce  posi- 
tive economic  results  before  the  November  15  elections.  Most 
of  his  allied  gubernatorial  candidates  were  defeated,  and  his 
coalition  remained  a  minority  in  Congress.  As  inflation 
increased  in  1991,  the  government  began  to  flounder,  and  the 
opposition  was  able  to  thwart  many  of  his  proposals.  Many  of 
his  initiatives  in  the  international  arena  came  to  naught. 

In  late  1991,  Collor  counterattacked  in  a  media  blitz,  blam- 
ing constitutional  impediments  for  obstructing  his  moderniza- 
tion plan  and  boldly  proposing  a  broad  constitutional  reform 
package  of  sixteen  amendments.  However,  in  March  1992,  as 
new  accusations  of  corruption  mounted  daily,  Collor  fired 
almost  his  entire  cabinet  (except  for  the  military  ministers  and 
the  ministers  of  health  and  education,  who  were  not  politi- 
cians) and  brought  in  older,  more  experienced  politicians  who 
generally  were  considered  "clean." 

A  month  later,  the  president's  younger  brother,  Pedro  Col- 
lor, unleashed  his  bombastic  accusations  regarding  the  modus 
operandi  of  the  corruption  system,  and  on  June  1,  1992,  Con- 
gress installed  the  impeachment  CPI.  President  Collor, 
together  with  his  adviser,  Paulo  Cesar  Farias,  and  other  cronies 
from  Alagoas,  had  taken  office  with  a  "dynasty"  strategy  in 
mind.  As  described  by  Pedro  Collor  and  other  CPI  witnesses, 
the  Collor-Farias  administration  centralized  all  corruption, 
demanding  40  percent  kickbacks  for  all  government  contracts 
and  special  policy  decisions.  With  a  war  chest  accumulating  at 
nearly  US$2  billion  a  year,  they  apparently  expected  to  bribe 
their  way  into  power  for  the  next  twenty  years.  As  the  1993-94 
Budgetgate  CPI  revealed,  this  conspiracy  had  numerous  collab- 
orators in  Congress  and  the  executive  branch.  Because  the 
1992  impeachment  CPI  threatened  to  widen  its  inquiry,  the 
politicians  decided  to  sacrifice  Collor  quickly  to  obscure  their 
own  involvement.

Franco's  Presidency,  1 992-94 

Senator  Itamar  Franco  (Liberal  Party-Minas  Gerais)  had 
been  chosen  as  Collor's  running  mate  for  three  reasons:  Minas 
Gerais  had  the  second  largest  electorate;  Franco  had  led  the 
impeachment  CPI  against  Sarney's  alleged  corruption;  and 
Franco  was  the  ideal  anti-impeachment  "insurance"  because  of 
his  idiosyncratic  nature.  During  the  1989  campaign,  Franco 
had  threatened  to  resign  several  times  and  later  voiced  outspo- 
ken opposition  to  some  Collor  policies,  especially  concerning 
privatization.  As  president,  Franco  immediately  installed  a 
politically  balanced  cabinet  and  sought  broad  support  in  Con- 
gress. 

Franco's  presidential  style  was  the  opposite  to  that  of  Collor. 
A  man  of  more  simple  habits  and  tastes,  Franco  refused  the 
imperial,  ceremonious  presidential  role.  However,  he  proved 
to  be  quite  temperamental,  and  many  of  his  appointments 
were  ill-conceived  and  short-lived.  His  most  serious  difficulty 
was  defining  an  optimum  economic  strategy  and  selecting  a 
minister  of  finance.  He  slowed  Collor's  privatization  program 
to  a  near  standstill  and  reverted  to  a  developmentalist,  nation- 
alist model  that  was  based  on  a  national  plan  to  guide  the  coun- 
try through  a  series  of  stages  of  development,  eventually 


295 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

culminating  in  modernization.  After  successively  appointing 
two  politicians  and  an  academic  economist  to  head  the  Minis- 
try of  Finance,  Franco  moved  Senator  Fernando  Henrique  Car- 
doso (PSDB-Sao  Paulo)  from  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  to 
Finance  in  May  1993. 

In  October  1993,  Congress  installed  a  CPI  to  investigate  its 
own  members  involved  in  a  far-reaching  scandal  within  the 
joint  budget  committee.  The  scandal  had  begun  during  the 
Sarney  period  and  extended  into  Franco's  government.  In 
addition  to  investigating  possible  involvement  of  some  fifty 
members  of  Congress  and  identifying  the  "corrupters"  in  the 
private  sector,  the  investigations  unmasked  a  conspiracy  ring 
within  the  executive  branch  that  involved  several  middle-level 
bureaucrats.  Distraught  by  the  scandal  reaching  the  executive 
branch,  President  Franco  contemplated  resigning.  However, 
cooler  heads  persuaded  him  not  to,  and  instead  the  president 
appointed  several  distinguished  citizens  to  a  Special  Investigat- 
ing Commission  (Comissao  Especial  de  Investigacao — CEI) 
headed  by  the  SAF  (Federal  Administration  Secretariat)  chief. 
Some  of  those  involved  in  corruption  were  fired.  Franco  also 
appointed  several  military  officers  to  civilian  positions  in  the 
Ministry  of  Transport,  Federal  Police,  and  Office  of  the  Federal 
Budget  Director,  which  had  difficult  problems. 

With  Cardoso's  PSDB  (Brazilian  Social  Democracy  Party) 
team  installed  at  Finance,  the  Franco  government  became  less 
erratic,  and  the  kitchen  cabinet's  influence  somewhat  dimin- 
ished. However,  inflation  had  increased  from  25  percent  to  45 
percent  by  April  1994,  when  Cardoso  resigned  to  run  for  presi- 
dent, a  month  after  his  new  stabilization  plan  went  into  effect. 

The  economic  stabilization  plan  took  into  account  all  the 
errors  of  the  Cruzado  Plan  of  1986,  and  both  Cardoso  and  his 
team  were  aware  of  its  potential  effect  on  the  1994  elections. 
Because  of  the  great  success  of  the  Real  Plan,  President 
Franco's  approval  rating  soared  to  nearly  80  percent  at  the  end 
of  his  term.  The  Franco-Cardoso  transition  was  the  most  tran- 
quil in  Brazilian  political  history. 

Cardoso's  Presidency,  1 995- 

Cardoso  was  inaugurated  as  president  on  January  1,  1995, 
under  the  most  auspicious  circumstances.  He  had  won  an  out- 
right victory  in  the  first  round  of  the  election  and  had  poten- 
tially strong  support  blocs  in  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  and 
Senate.  He  had  strong  support  from  a  majority  of  the  newly

elected  governors,  including  those  from  the  important  states  of 
Minas  Gerais,  Sao  Paulo,  and  Rio  de  Janeiro,  which  had  elected 
governors  from  the  president's  own  PSDB.  Further,  the  Decem- 
ber 1994  inflation  rate  was  less  than  1  percent,  unemployment 
was  low,  and  popular  expectations  ratings  were  extremely  high. 

After  his  inauguration,  Cardoso  called  the  lame-duck  Con- 
gress into  session  in  an  attempt  to  pass  important  legislation 
not  acted  on  in  1994.  President  Cardoso  abolished  the  CEI, 
which  had  not  yet  finished  investigating  corruption  in  the 
Franco  administration,  and  transferred  its  mission  to  the  new 
Internal  Control  Secretariat  (Secretaria  de  Controle  Interno — 
SCI).  The  Cardoso  government  pushed  privatization  and  orga- 
nized the  sale  of  the  Rio  Doce  Valley  Company  (Companhia 
Vale  do  Rio  Doce — CVRD),  one  of  the  world's  largest  mining 
firms;  the  telecommunications  system;  and  the  electricity  sec- 
tor. 

In  1995  Congress  enacted  major  constitutional  reforms, 
including  economic  deregulation,  eliminating  state  monopo- 
lies, and  changes  in  election  and  party  legislation.  By  July  1995, 
the  lower  house  had  passed  (and  transmitted  to  the  Senate)  all 
five  amendments  dealing  with  the  economic  area.  The  amend- 
ments reduced  to  varying  degrees  state-held  monopolies  on 


297 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

coastal  shipping,  natural  gas  distribution,  telecommunications, 
and  petroleum,  and  eliminated  the  distinction  between  domes- 
tic and  foreign  firms  in  Article  171. 

Perhaps  the  most  important  task  of  the  Cardoso  government 
in  1995  was  to  promote  the  reform  of  key  sections  of  the  1988 
constitution  in  order  to  reduce  the  role  of  the  state  in  the  econ- 
omy, reform  the  federal  bureaucracy,  reorganize  the  social 
security  system,  rework  federalist  relationships,  overhaul  the 
complicated  tax  system,  and  effect  electoral  and  party  reforms 
to  strengthen  the  political  representation  of  political  parties.  In 
February  1995,  the  new  Cardoso  government  moved  quickly  to 
initiate  constitutional  reform  by  a  three-fifths  majority  of  each 
house. 

In  the  area  of  political  reforms,  Congress  sought  to  improve 
Brazil's  very  weak  party  system.  Congress  proposed  establishing 
a  mixed  system,  prohibiting  coalitions  in  proportional  elec- 
tions, establishing  a  minimum  representation  threshold  (5  per- 
cent), permitting  immediate  reelection  to  executive  office, 
imposing  more  rigid  party  fidelity  norms,  restricting  party 
access  to  television  and  radio  time,  and  establishing  stricter

The  women's  suffrage  movement  began  in  Brazil  in  the  early 
1900s.  As  in  the  United  States,  women  were  first  fully  enfran- 
chised at  the  state  level.  In  1927  in  Rib  Grande  do  Norte,  the 
state  election  laws  were  amended  giving  women  the  right  to 
vote.  A  year  later,  Alzira  Soriano  was  elected  mayor  of  Lajes, 
Santa  Catarina  State.  Finally,  the  new  national  election  code, 
signed  by  President  Vargas  in  1932,  allowed  women  to  vote  in 
the  May  1933  elections  for  the  1934  Constituent  Assembly.  Two 
women  were  elected  to  that  body. 

Many  women  have  been  elected  mayors.  In  1985  Luiza  Fon- 
tenelle  (Workers'  Party)  was  the  first  woman  elected  in  a  state 
capital  (Fortaleza,  Ceara).  The  most  important  elective  office 
held  by  a  woman  in  Brazil  was  the  mayorship  of  Sao  Paulo, 
which  Luiza  Erundina  (Workers'  Party)  won  in  1988. 

Although  women  have  become  federal  judges  by  public 
examination,  none  has  ever  been  appointed  to  Brazil's  supe- 
rior courts.  In  1988  President  Sarney  appointed  the  first 
woman  to  the  National  Accounting  Court.  However,  this 
appointment  was  more  related  to  the  appointee's  notorious 


298

journalist  husband  than  to  her  judicial  qualifications  (see  Gen- 
der, ch.  2). 

By  1994  women  constituted  nearly  half  of  the  electorate.  In 
August  1994,  data  from  the  TSE  (Superior  Electoral  Court) 
showed  that  of  94,782,410  registered  voters,  49.4  percent  were 
women. 

No  women  were  elected  to  Congress  in  the  1946-51  period, 
but  Getulio  Vargas's  niece,  Ivette  Vargas,  was  elected  federal 
deputy  from  Sao  Paulo  in  1950  at  age  twenty-three.  Women 
continued  to  have  minuscule  representation  in  Congress  and 
in  state  assemblies  until  the  political  opening  (abertura)  in 
1982,  when  nine  women  were  elected  to  the  Chamber  of  Depu- 
ties, followed  by  twenty-six  in  1986,  twenty-three  in  1990,  and 
thirty-six  in  1994.  Among  the  latter,  Vanessa  Cunha  (PSDB-Rio 
de  Janeiro)  was  the  youngest  federal  deputy  at  age  twenty-two. 
Among  state  deputies,  seventy-nine  women  were  elected  in 
1994. 

The  first  female  senator  assumed  office  in  1979  as  an  alter- 
nate on  the  death  of  her  predecessor.  Since  then  a  few  women 
have  been  elected  to  the  Senate  in  successive  elections.  In  1994 
fourteen  women  were  candidates  for  the  Senate,  and  four  were 
elected. 

In  1996  Congress  adopted  a  quota  system  (20  percent)  for 
female  candidates  for  city  council,  and  this  policy  increased  the 
number  of  women  elected.  In  1997  Congress  extended  the 
mechanism  to  the  1998  general  elections. 

Until  1994  no  women  had  been  elected  governor  in  their 
own  right.  When  the  governor  of  Acre  resigned  to  run  for  the 
Senate  in  1982,  Yolanda  Fleming  was  appointed  governor  to 
serve  out  the  last  ten  months  of  the  term.  In  1994  eleven 
women  ran  for  governor,  and  three  made  it  into  the  second- 
round  runoff — Angela  Amin  (PPR — Santa  Catarina),  Lucia 
Vania  of  the  Progressive  Party,  and  Roseana  Sarney  (PFL-Mara- 
nhao).  Sarney,  a  daughter  of  the  former  president,  was  elected 
by  a  very  small  margin. 

In  1994  women  became  candidates  for  vice  president  for  the 
first  time.  The  PMDB  chose  Iris  Rezende,  wife  of  the  Goias  gov- 
ernor, to  be  Orestes  Quercia's  running  mate.  Although 
Rezende,  a  Protestant,  had  never  held  a  formal  political  office, 
she  was  very  active  in  politics  while  first  lady  of  Goias.  With  her 
candidacy,  the  PMDB  hoped  to  attract  the  growing  number  of 
Protestant  voters.  Not  to  be  outdone,  the  PPR  chose  Gardenia 
Goncalves  from  Maranhao  as  a  running  mate  for  Senator  Espe- 


299

ridiao  Amin.  Goncalves's  husband  had  been  a  governor  and 
senator  from  Maranhao,  in  opposition  to  the  Sarney  group, 
and  in  1992  she  was  elected  mayor  of  the  capital  city,  Sao  Luis. 

Figueiredo  (president,  1979-85)  was  the  first  president  to 
name  a  woman  to  a  cabinet  position — Professor  Esther 
Figueiredo  Ferraz  (no  relation  to  the  president)  as  minister  of 
education  and  culture.  His  successors  also  appointed  female 
cabinet  ministers,  the  most  famous  of  whom  was  Zelia  Cardoso 
de  Melo,  President  Collor's  minister  of  economy.  President 
Franco's  cabinet  included  three  women.  President  Cardoso 
appointed  one  woman  during  his  first  year  in  office,  but  she 
was  replaced  by  a  man  in  1996. 

The  Electoral  System 

Since  independence  Brazil  has  experimented  with  almost 
every  possible  electoral  system:  single  and  multimember  dis- 
tricts, and  proportional  representation  with  various  formulas. 
Only  the  so-called  mixed  systems  are  yet  to  be  tried.  Election 
day  is  always  a  national  holiday.  Until  1965  national  and  state 
elections  were  held  on  October  3,  but  the  military  moved  the 
date  to  November  15  (Day  of  the  Republic,  a  military  holiday). 
The  constitution  of  1988  reestablished  October  3  (ninety  days 
before  the  inauguration  of  executive-branch  elected  officials) 
for  the  first  round  of  voting,  and  November  15  for  runoff  elec- 
tions when  needed.  As  of  1998,  first-round  elections  will  be 
held  on  the  first  Sunday  in  October  and  runoff  second  rounds 
on  the  last  Sunday  of  October. 

Brazilian  election  laws  are  very  complex  and  detailed.  The 
law  requires  that  all  candidates  who  hold  executive  positions 
resign  six  months  before  the  election  (see  The  Legislature,  this 
ch.).  No  "write-in"  candidacies  are  allowed;  only  candidates 
officially  presented  by  a  registered  political  party  may  partici- 
pate. Parties  choose  their  candidates  in  municipal,  state,  or 
national  conventions.  Although  the  legislation  does  not  recog- 
nize party  primaries  officially,  on  occasion  they  have  been  used 
informally. 

Voting  is  considered  both  a  right  and  a  duty  in  Brazil;  thus, 
registration  and  voting  are  compulsory  between  the  ages  of 
eighteen  and  seventy.  Illiterates  vote,  but  their  voting  registra- 
tion card  identifies  their  status,  and  they  sign  the  voting  list 
with  a  fingerprint  on  election  day.  The  1988  constitution  low- 
ered the  voting  age,  permitting  sixteen-  and  seventeen-year- 
olds  to  vote  on  a  voluntary  basis.  In  1994  these  young  voters 


300 


Government  and  Politics 


(who  cannot  legally  drink  or  drive)  totaled  2,132,190  (2.2  per- 
cent of  the  electorate).  For  these  reasons,  turnouts  for  all  elec- 
tions in  Brazil  are  very  high,  usually  more  than  85  percent.  At 
certain  times,  voters  have  cast  blank  and  void  ballots  as  a  means 
of  protest,  especially  in  1970,  when  military  oppression  was  at 
its  height. 

Before  1966  individual  paper  ballots  were  used  for  each 
office,  and  the  voter  placed  the  appropriate  set  in  an  envelope, 
which  was  inserted  into  the  ballot  box.  Since  1966  unified  sin- 
gle ballots  have  been  used  for  simultaneous  elections.  In  1996 
fifty-one  of  Brazil's  largest  cities  used  a  new  electronic  voting 
machine  with  great  success.  In  1998  some  90  million  voters  will 
use  this  new  technique,  which  may  become  a  hot  export  item. 
For  majority  elections,  candidates'  names  are  listed  in  random 
order,  and  the  voter  must  mark  the  respective  box.  For  propor- 
tional elections,  the  voter  can  write  the  name  or  identification 
(ID)  number  of  the  candidate,  or  write  the  symbol  or  ID  num- 
ber of  the  party  preference.  There  is  no  alternative  to  making  a 
straight  party  vote  for  all  offices  on  the  ballot.  This  procedure 
is  extremely  complicated  for  voters  with  little  schooling.  In 
elections  in  the  first  half  of  the  1990s,  many  voted  for  one  or 
two  executive  offices  and  left  the  rest  of  the  ballot  blank. 

Before  Congress  adopted  Law  No.  8,713  in  September  1993, 
there  were  few  restrictions  on  campaign  finances.  Businesses 
and  labor  unions  could  not  make  political  contributions.  Indi- 
vidual persons  could  contribute  to  parties,  but  not  to  individual 
candidates.  Parties  were  required  to  submit  their  accounting  to 
the  TSE  (Superior  Electoral  Court),  countersigned  by  each 
other.  In  1994  contributions  from  individual  businesses  (but 
not  labor  unions)  were  legalized,  and  electoral  bonus  (bonus 
eleitoral)  receipts  were  issued  to  contributors,  who  have  often 
used  them  to  evade  taxes. 

In  1994  Law  No.  8,713  also  required  parties  and  candidates 
to  submit  to  the  electoral  courts  detailed  balance  sheets  listing 
contributors  and  expenses.  These  reports  were  made  public 
and  hastily  analyzed  by  the  press.  Cardoso's  presidential  cam- 
paign listed  expenses  of  nearly  R$32  million,  about  one  real  per 
vote,  and  contributions  from  banks,  large  construction  firms, 
and  businesses. 

Brazil  has  four  types  of  majority  elections:  the  president,  gov- 
ernors, and  mayors  are  elected  by  absolute  majorities;  senators, 
by  simple  majorities.  In  elections  for  president,  governors,  and 
mayors  of  cities  with  more  than  200,000  voters,  a  runoff  is 


301 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

required  between  the  top  two  candidates  if  no  one  receives  an 
absolute  majority  in  the  first  round  (50  percent  plus  at  least 
one  vote).  The  president,  governors,  and  mayors  have  their 
respective  vice  president,  vice  governors,  and  vice  mayors,  who 
are  elected  on  unified  slates. 

The  May  1994  constitutional  revision  reducing  the  presiden- 
tial term  from  five  to  four  years  unified  the  terms  of  the  presi- 
dent, state  governors,  and  Congress.  State  and  national 
elections  are  scheduled  for  1998  and  2002,  two  years  out  of 
phase  with  municipal  elections,  which  are  set  for  1996  and 
2000. 

Three  senators  are  elected  by  simple  majority  to  represent 
each  of  the  twenty-six  states  and  the  Federal  District.  They  are 
elected  to  alternating  eight-year  terms:  one  seat  will  be  con- 
tested in  1998  and  the  other  two  in  2002.  Each  senator  has  an 
alternate  elected  on  a  unified  ticket,  usually  from  another 
party  in  the  coalition.  If  the  senator  elected  takes  leave,  dies, 
resigns,  or  is  expelled,  the  alternate  takes  over. 

Brazil  uses  an  open-list  d'Hondt  proportional  representation 
system  to  elect  federal  and  state  deputies  and  city  council  mem- 
bers. Each  party  or  coalition  selects  its  list  of  candidates,  which 
is  registered  with  the  respective  Electoral  Court  in  June.  Coali- 
tion partners  lose  their  identity  and  compete  in  a  single  "bas- 
ket" of  votes.  Coalitions  are  very  important  for  proportional 
representation  elections  in  Brazil.  In  1962  nearly  50  percent  of 
federal  deputies  were  elected  through  coalitions.  With  the 
surge  of  new  parties  created  after  1985,  coalitions  again 
appeared  in  the  1986,  1990,  and  1996  elections.  These  coali- 
tions accounted  for  nearly  90  percent  of  those  elected. 

In  proportional  representation  elections,  voters  have  the 
option  of  making  a  party  vote.  Usually,  however,  the  propor- 
tional representation  campaigns  are  so  individualized  (many 
candidates  never  mention  their  party  label  in  their  propa- 
ganda) that  the  party  vote  is  very  small  (8  percent  in  1994).  An 
exception  is  the  Workers'  Party,  which  received  33  percent  of  its 
votes  for  federal  deputy  as  party  votes  in  1994.

The  Presidential  Election  of  1 989 

The  1989  presidential  election,  the  first  direct  presidential 
election  since  1960,  was  established  by  the  1988  constitution. 
The  1988  municipal  elections  were  a  preview  of  the  1989  elec- 


302 


Government  and  Politics 


tions  for  the  PMDB,  the  nation's  largest  party,  which  lost  in 
most  cities  with  a  population  of  more  than  100,000.  Leonel  Bri- 
zola's  PDT  (Democratic  Labor  Party)  and  Lula's  Workers'  Party 
made  considerable  gains,  as  voters  made  plain  their  rejection 
of  parties  associated  with  the  Sarney  government. 

As  a  result  of  more  lenient  legislation,  twenty-two  parties 
qualified  candidates  for  the  presidency  in  1989.  The  PRN 
(Party  of  National  Reconstruction)  was  hastily  organized  by  a 
questionable  takeover  of  the  Youth  Party  (Partido  da Juven- 
tude — PJ)  to  launch  the  candidacy  of  Alagoas  governor 
Fernando  Collor  de  Mello,  who  had  been  elected  by  the  PMDB 
in  1986,  and  had  a  brief  flirtation  with  the  PSDB  in  late  1988. 
Six  of  the  major  candidates  were  closely  associated  with  the  Sar- 
ney period  or  with  the  Big  Center  in  the  ANC  (National  Con- 
stituent Assembly). 

By  June  1989,  Collor,  aided  by  numerous  television  appear- 
ances, had  close  to  50  percent  of  voter  preference.  His  other 
advantages  in  this  election  included  his  antiparty  and  antiestab- 
lishment  posture;  his  being  relatively  unknown  politically;  a 
huge  war  chest  of  campaign  funds,  efficiently  collected  by  cam- 
paign treasurer,  Paulo  Cesar  Farias;  a  fleet  of  fifteen  Lear  jets  at 
his  disposal  for  campaigning;  a  sophisticated  campaign  organi- 
zation; and  his  good  communication  and  oratory  skills, 
acquired  while  working  at  the  family  television  station  in 
Maceio. 

In  the  first  round  of  voting,  Collor  received  28.5  percent  of 
the  votes  and  Lula,  16.1  percent,  slightly  edging  out  Brizola  in 
a  close  third  (see  table  22,  Appendix).  In  the  second  round, 
Lula  managed  to  pull  ahead  of  Collor  in  the  polls  by  some  5 
percent  in  the  last  ten  days  of  the  campaign.  However,  because 
of  Collor's  negative  campaign  attacks  against  Lula,  the  election 
swung  in  Collor's  favor  by  a  5.7  percent  margin  (see  table  23, 
Appendix).  Collor's  geographic  vote  distribution  was  very  simi- 
lar to  that  of  the  PDS  (Democratic  Social  Party) — the  smaller 
the  city,  the  larger  Collor's  proportion  of  the  vote. 

Congressional  and  State  Elections,  1 990 

Although  President  Collor  had  been  able  to  pass  most  of  his 
emergency  legislation  in  1990,  he  knew  that  his  government 
needed  to  elect  a  solid  majority  to  Congress,  backed  up  by  sym- 
pathetic governors.  The  economic  stabilization  plan  adopted 
in  March  1990  produced  a  deep  recession,  which  was  not 
reversed  before  the  October  3  general  elections.  The  1988  con- 


303 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

stitution  had  created  three  new  states — Amapa,  Roraima,  and 
Tocantins — and  home  rule  came  to  Brasilia,  which  elected  its 
first  governor.  Thus,  twenty-six  states  and  the  Federal  District 
held  simultaneous  elections  for  governor,  state  assemblies,  the 
full  503-member  Chamber  of  Deputies,  and  thirty-one  senators 
(the  new  states  of  Amapa  and  Roraima  elected  three  senators 
each). 

Seventeen  of  the  gubernatorial  races  had  runoffs  on  Novem- 
ber 15.  Among  the  twenty-seven  governors  elected,  Collor  had 
four  staunch  allies,  eleven  sometime  allies,  and  twelve  in  oppo- 
sition. Parties  nominally  aligned  with  Collor  had  elected  close 
to  an  absolute  majority  (252)  of  federal  deputies,  but  because 
of  low  party  loyalty  and  cohesion,  the  president  had  great  diffi- 
culty passing  his  legislative  agenda  in  1991  (see  table  24, 
Appendix).  The  PMDB  (Brazilian  Democratic  Movement 
Party)  remained  the  largest  party  in  Congress,  retaining  the 
presidency  of  the  Senate.  However,  in  1993  the  PMDB  lost  the 
presidency  of  the  Chamber  to  a  PFL-led  coalition.  Nineteen 
parties  gained  representation  in  the  lower  house. 

Municipal  Elections,  1992 

The  1992  municipal  elections  were  held  five  days  after  Col- 
lor's  impeachment.  The  PMDB  recovered  some  positions  lost 
in  1988.  The  PFL  (Liberal  Front  Party),  PSDB,  and  PDS  (Dem- 
ocratic Social  Party)  also  made  moderate  advances. 

General  Elections,  1 994 

The  1994  elections  were  significant  because  the  presidential 
election  coincided  with  the  general  elections  for  governor,  sen- 
ator, and  federal  and  state  deputy  for  the  first  time  since  1950. 
It  was  expected  that  a  strong  presidential  showing  would  have 
strong  coattails  (see  Glossary)  at  the  state  level.  However,  many 
thought  that  election  results  proved  otherwise.  Coalition-build- 
ing was  generally  inconsistent  between  the  national  and  state 
levels,  because  local  political  animosities  and  affinities  were  so 
diverse  from  state  to  state  that  none  of  the  presidential  coali- 
tions could  cover  all  the  possible  combinations.  Among  the 
major  parties,  the  PFL,  PTB  (Brazilian  Labor  Party),  and  Pro- 
gressive Party  decided  not  to  field  separate  presidential  candi- 
dates. The  PMDB,  PDT  (Democratic  Labor  Party),  PPR 
(Progressive  Renewal  Party) ,  Workers'  Party,  and  PSDB  decided 
to  run  their  own  candidates.  Four  minor  parties — the  Liberal 
Party  (Partido  Liberal — PL),  National  Order  Redefinition 


304 


Brasilia,  at  night

Party  (Partido  da  Redefinicao  da  Ordem  Nacional — Prona), 
PRN  (Party  of  National  Reconstruction),  and  Social  Christian 
Party  (Partido  Social  Cristao — PSC) — also  nominated  candi- 
dates. 

Despite  opposition  from  a  minority,  the  PMDB  nominated 
former  Sao  Paulo  governor  Orestes  Quercia  as  its  presidential 
candidate.  The  PDT  again  nominated  Leonel  Brizola.  Lula's 
Workers'  Party  articulated  a  broad  coalition  on  the  left,  includ- 
ing the  Brazilian  Socialist  Party  (Partido  Socialista  Brasileiro — 
PSB),  Popular  Socialist  Party  (Partido  Popular  Socialista — 
PPS),  PC  do  B  (Communist  Party  of  Brazil),  and  Green  Party 
(Partido  Verde — PV) .  However,  Marxist  wings  of  the  Workers' 
Party,  having  gained  control  of  the  party's  Executive  Commit- 
tee, imposed  a  difficult,  radical  platform  on  the  campaign. 

Cardoso  had  become  minister  of  finance  in  May  1993  and 
had  assembled  the  same  PSDB  economic  team  that  had  formu- 
lated the  Cruzado  Plan  in  1986.  This  time,  however,  the  team 
put  together  a  stabilization  plan  that  included  the  components 
missing  in  1986.  The  hope  was  that  the  initiative  would  boost 
Cardoso's  potential  candidacy  into  the  second  round.  In  Febru- 
ary 1994,  Congress  approved  the  Real  Value  Units  (Unidades 


305 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Reais  de  Valor — URVs;  see  real  (R$)  in  Glossary)  Stabilization 
Plan,  which  gave  the  minister  of  finance  almost  absolute  power 
to  impound  or  reallocate  budgeted  funds,  reduce  the  fiscal  def- 
icit, and  conduct  a  rescheduling  of  the  foreign  debt. 

The  impact  of  the  RealVlm  on  the  preference  polls  was  even 
more  dramatic  than  PSDB  strategists  had  imagined.  They  had 
thought  that,  at  best,  if  the  plan  were  a  success,  Cardoso  might 
pull  even  with  Lula  by  the  end  of  August,  thus  guaranteeing  a 
second  round  in  November.  However,  Cardoso  surpassed  Lula 
in  the  Datafolha  firm's  presidential  preference  poll  results  at 
the  end  of  July  by  successfully  branding  the  Workers'  Party  as 
against  the  Real  Plan  and  for  inflation.  Cardoso  went  on  to  win 
the  election  outright  on  the  first  round  with  54.3  percent  of  the 
valid  votes  cast  (44.1  percent  of  the  total  vote,  including  blank 
and  null  ballots)  (see  table  25,  Appendix).  Lula  placed  second 
with  27.0  percent.  Cardoso's  PSDB-PFL-PTB  coalition  received 
additional  support  from  the  PMDB  and  PPR,  which  abandoned 
their  candidates  and  climbed  aboard  the  Cardoso  bandwagon. 
In  addition  to  electing  the  president  and  a  majority  of  the  gov- 
ernors, the  Center  coalition  returned  substantial  majorities  to 
Congress. 

The  social-liberal  alliance,  the  Big  Center,  that  elected  Car- 
doso on  the  first  round  enjoyed  only  moderate  presidential 
coattails  at  the  state  level  (see  table  26,  Appendix).  The  PSDB- 
PFL-PTB  alliance  elected  nine  (33  percent)  governors,  twenty- 
four  of  fifty-four  (44  percent)  senators  up  for  election,  182  of 
513  (35  percent)  federal  deputies,  and  324  of  1,045  (31  per- 
cent) state  deputies.  Cardoso  placed  first  in  every  state  except 
the  Federal  District  (Brasilia)  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul.  Lula  sur- 
passed Cardoso  in  the  Federal  District  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul, 
where  his  coattails  pulled  the  Workers'  Party  gubernatorial  can- 
didates into  the  second  round. 

The  1994  gubernatorial  election  was  the  fourth  in  a  series  of 
direct  elections  for  governor  since  their  reinstatement  in  1982. 
Compared  with  1990,  the  PSDB  had  the  best  performance  of 
all  parties  in  1994.  The  PSDB  was  formed  hastily  in  June  1988, 
and  in  1990  elected  only  one  governor  (Ceara).  In  1994  the 
PSDB  won  six  governorships,  including  Minas  Gerais,  Sao 
Paulo,  and  Rio  de  Janeiro.  These  three  states  account  for 
nearly  60  percent  of  Brazil's  gross  national  product  (GNP — see 
Glossary)  and  tax  base.  Certainly,  presidential  coattails  and  the 
Real  Plan  were  important  factors  in  these  three  second-round 
victories.  Brizola's  PDT  lost  the  three  states  won  in  1990,  but  in

Government  and  Politics 


1994  elected  the  governors  of  Parana  (Jaime  Lerner)  and  Mato 
Grosso  (Dante  de  Oliveira),  both  on  the  first  round.  The  Work- 
ers' Party  made  it  into  the  second  round  in  three  states  and 
won  in  two:  Brasilia  and  Espirito  Santo.  The  two  victories  gave 
the  Workers'  Party  a  chance  to  demonstrate  how  it  would  man- 
age a  state  government.  The  party  had  already  elected  mayors 
in  major  cities  (Sao  Paulo,  Porto  Alegre,  and  Belo  Horizonte) 
in  1988  and  1992. 

Of  the  fifty-four  Senate  seats  up  for  election  in  1994,  only 
nine  incumbents  were  reelected.  Six  of  the  twenty-seven  sena- 
tors elected  in  1990  were  replaced  by  their  respective  alternates 
(five  were  elected  to  other  offices  and  one  died).  Thus,  in  1995 
fifty-one  of  the  eighty-one  senators  were  new,  although  five  of 
the  latter  had  served  in  the  Senate  before  1990.  The  PMDB, 
PFL,  and  PSDB  continued  to  have  the  largest  upper-house  del- 
egations; and  the  PFL  made  substantial  gains  (see  table  27, 
Appendix) .  The  most  significant  change  was  the  advance  of  the 
left.  From  only  two  senators  in  1991,  this  group  increased  to 
seven  (five  from  the  Workers'  Party).  The  PPS,  the  former  PCB 
(Brazilian  Communist  Party) ,  elected  its  first  senator  (Roberto 
Freire)  since  Luis  Carlos  Prestes  was  elected  in  1945. 

The  Chamber  of  Deputies  was  enlarged  in  1995  with  the 
expansion  of  the  Sao  Paulo  State  delegation  from  sixty  to  sev- 
enty as  mandated  by  the  1988  constitution.  Turnover  in  the 
lower  house  in  1995  (275  new  deputies  out  of  513,  or  53.6  per- 
cent) was  slightly  lower  than  that  in  1991.  As  in  1991,  the 
Chamber  of  Deputies  in  1995  continued  to  have  two  larger  par- 
ties (PMDB  and  PFL)  and  six  middle-sized  parties.  By  electing 
deputies  in  all  five  regions  of  Brazil,  these  eight  parties,  as  well 
as  the  PC  do  B,  have  a  more  national  representation. 

Voter  turnout  was  lower  in  1994  (82.2  percent)  than  in  1989 
(88.1  percent),  and  blank  and  null  votes  were  more  frequent  in 
1994  than  in  1989.  These  differences  may  have  resulted  in  part 
from  the  fact  that  the  1994  election  was  more  complicated, 
with  two  ballots  and  six  offices. 

Municipal  Elections,  1996 

On  October  3,  1996,  voters  in  5,581  municipalities  chose 
mayors  and  city  councils.  Only  thirty-one  cities  held  runoff 
elections  on  November  15.  Big  gains  were  made  by  the  PSDB 
and  the  PFL,  which  took  the  cities  of  Rio  de  Janeiro,  Salvador, 
and  Recife  for  the  first  time,  while  a  divided  PMDB  declined 
considerably.  Paulo  Maluf  elected  his  successor  as  mayor  of  Sao

Paulo,  thereby  reinforcing  his  future  political  ambitions.  On 
the  left,  the  Workers'  Party  suffered  reverses,  and  the  PSB 
advanced. 

Generally,  issues  were  local  and  not  national,  and  women 
had  increased  participation,  boosted  by  the  new  20  percent 
quota  rule  for  proportional  elections.  About  142  federal  depu- 
ties decided  to  run  in  these  local  elections,  but  only  forty-two 
won  and  thus  left  the  Congress.  The  apparent  desire  for  admin- 
istrative continuity  enhanced  the  arguments  in  favor  of  the 
reelection  amendment. 

Interest  Group  Politics 

Brazil  has  very  intense  and  diversified  interest  groups. 
Before  1964  the  most  visible  were  labor  unions,  student  organi- 
zations, and  business  groups,  which  exercised  their  pressures 
more  on  Congress  than  on  the  executive  branch.  During  the 
military  period,  especially  from  1969  to  1974,  interest  groups 
continued  to  operate  but  almost  exclusively  vis-a-vis  the  execu- 
tive branch.  In  1983,  when  it  became  apparent  that  a  political 
transition  would  take  place,  Congress  again  became  the  focal 
point  of  interest  groups.  The  most  explicit  example  of  this 
trend  was  the  ANC  (National  Constituent  Assembly),  when  lit- 
erally thousands  of  lobbyists — one  researcher  catalogued  121 
noninstitutional  groups — descended  on  Brasilia. 

Interest  Groups 

Government  institutions  lobby  the  executive  and  legislative 
branches  through  their  legislative  liaisons  and  employee  associ- 
ations. The  president's  office  maintains  a  Subsecretariat  for 
Congressional  Relations.  State  enterprise  employee  associa- 
tions, such  as  those  of  the  Brazilian  Petroleum  Corporation 
(Petroleo  Brasileiro  S.A. — Petrobras)  and  the  Brazilian  Electric 
Power  Company,  Inc.  (Centrais  Eletricas  Brasileiras  S.A. — 
Eletrobras),  have  very  active  lobbying  organizations,  as  do  fede- 
ral employees.  All  states  and  many  large  cities  maintain  perma- 
nent representation  offices  in  Brasilia.  Although  strictly 
prohibited,  military  officers  exerted  heavy  pressure  on  the  gov- 
ernment for  better  salaries  in  1992-94  through  protest 
marches  by  military  families. 

In  1983  the  Interunion  Parliamentary  Advisory  Department 
(Departamento  Intersindical  de  Assessorial  Parlamentar — 
DIAP)  was  founded  to  coordinate  and  unify  the  lobbying 


308 


Government  and  Politics 


efforts  of  the  labor  movement.  The  DIAP  represented  517 
unions,  nine  confederations,  and  one  central  federation  in 
1992.  The  DIAP  soon  proved  highly  efficient  in  monitoring  leg- 
islative activities,  publishing  profiles  of  the  performance  of 
congressional  members,  and  identifying  friends  and  enemies 
of  workers.  In  the  1991-94  period,  the  party  leadership's 
manipulations  attempted  to  thwart  DIAP  monitoring  by  floor 
voting,  and  very  few  roll-call  votes  were  taken  during  that  ses- 
sion. 

Since  the  1930s,  business  groups  have  been  organized  into 
umbrella  federations  at  the  state  level  and  confederations  at 
the  national  level,  such  as  the  Sao  Paulo  State  Federation  of 
Industries  (Federacao  das  Industrias  do  Estado  de  Sao  Paulo — 
FIESP)  and  the  National  Confederation  of  Industry  (Confeder- 
acao  Nacional  das  Industrias — CNI).  Other  businesses  are 
organized  as  national  associations  by  sector:  the  Brazilian  Asso- 
ciation of  Radio  and  Television  Companies  (Associacao 
Brasileira  das  Empresas  de  Radio  e  Televisao — ABERT),  the 
Brazilian  Electro-Electronic  Industry  Association  (Associacao 
Brasileira  da  Industria  Eletro-Eletronica — ABINEE),  and  the 
Brazilian  Aluminum  Association  (Associacao  Brasileira  de 
Alummio — ABAL).  Business  groups  mounted  a  very  efficient 
lobbying  operation  in  support  of  the  Big  Center  during  the 
ANC. 

Professional  groups,  such  as  associations  of  medical  doctors, 
lawyers,  pharmacists,  and  engineers,  are  usually  more  active 
regarding  the  regulation  of  their  professions,  but  occasionally 
attempt  to  influence  more  generalized  economic  and  social 
legislation.  Since  the  1970s,  there  has  been  a  steady  growth  of 
urban  social  movements  and  groups  concerned  with  issues 
such  as  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  acquired  immune 
deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS) ,  racial  prejudice,  consumer  rights, 
ecology,  the  homeless,  Indians,  mortgages,  street  children,  and 
tenants.  As  a  result,  there  has  been  a  parallel  growth  of  nongov- 
ernmental organizations  (NGOs).  Some  NGOs  are  considered 
aggregative,  such  as  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Social  and  Eco- 
nomic Analysis  (Instituto  Brasileiro  de  Analise  Social  e 
Economica — IBASE)  in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  or  the  Institute  of 
Socioeconomic  Studies  (Instituto  de  Estudos  Socio-Economi- 
cos — Inesc)  in  Brasilia.  Some  are  more  issue-focused,  such  as 
the  Center  for  Indian  Rights  (Nucleo  de  Direitos  Indfgenos — 
NDI)  in  Brasilia,  or  SOS  Atlantic  Forest  (SOS  Mata  Atlantica) 
in  Rio  de  Janeiro. 


309 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Religious  groups  are  also  important.  The  Roman  Catholic 
Church  acts  officially  through  the  National  Conference  of  Bra- 
zilian Bishops  (Conferencia  Nacional  dos  Bispos  do  Brasil — 
CNBB).  However,  it  has  an  unofficial  far  right  wing  in  the  Bra- 
zilian Association  of  Tradition,  Family,  and  Property 
(Sociedade  Brasileira  de  Defesa  da  Tradicao,  Familia  e  Pro- 
priedade — TFP),  and  an  unofficial  left  wing  of  liberation  theol- 
ogy linked  to  the  Ecclesiastical  Base  Communities 
(Comunidades  Eclesiais  de  Base — CEBs)  (see  Glossary).  The 
center  and  left  had  always  elected  the  president  and  general 
secretary  of  the  CNBB  since  its  inception.  However,  in  May 
1995  conservative  Prime  Bishop-Cardinal  Lucas  Moreira  Neves 
was  elected  president  of  the  CNBB,  a  consequence  of  Pope 
John  Paul  IPs  consistent  appointment  of  conservative  bishops 
in  Brazil.  The  Protestants  have  their  Order  of  Evangelical  Min- 
isters (Ordem  dos  Ministros  Evangelicos — OME)  and  Political 
Action  Evangelical  Group  (Grupo  Evangelico  de  Acao 
Polftica — GEAP) . 

The  Lobbying  Process 

Three  basic  styles  of  lobbying  are  found  in  Brasilia:  the  inter- 
est group  sends  its  own  representatives  to  Brasilia,  when  the 
legislative  agenda  warrants;  the  interest  group  has  its  own  rep- 
resentatives permanently  installed  in  Brasilia;  or  the  group 
contracts  with  lobbyists  in  Brasilia  to  represent  its  interests.  Pro- 
fessional lobbyists  systematically  monitor  the  activities  of  Con- 
gress and  the  executive  branch  regarding  legislative  agendas 
and  procedures.  Visits  by  groups  and  individual  interests  to 
strategic  members  of  Congress  are  organized  frequently.  In 
some  cases,  the  deputies'  geographical  vote  profiles  for  the  last 
election  within  their  state  are  analyzed  for  the  client.  When  the 
interest  group  has  a  large  membership,  bus  caravans  to  Brasilia 
are  organized  to  pressure  Congress  or  the  executive  branch. 

As  in  many  legislatures,  the  Brazilian  Congress  also  has 
inside  lobbyists;  that  is,  Chamber  of  Deputies  or  Senate  staff, 
and  some  members  themselves  (the  so-called  single-issue  dep- 
uty or  senator) .  Because  staff  are  very  important  to  the  legisla- 
tive process,  they  are  cultivated  assiduously  by  lobbyists,  and 
many  become  sensitive  to  (or  eventually  agents  for)  certain 
interest  groups.  In  response  to  these  pressures,  the  Chamber  of 
Deputies  Research  Staff  Association  began  preparing  a  Code  of 
Ethics  in  1993. 


310 


Government  and  Politics 


Campaign  contributions  are  local  and  are  an  integral  part  of 
the  lobbying  process.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  issues  electoral 
bonus  receipts  for  campaign  contributions.  Many  contributing 
businesses,  however,  have  used  these  receipts  to  evade  taxes  by 
providing  documentation  for  their  bogus  records,  known  as 
their  caixa  dois  (second  set  of  books).  Several  bills  have  been 
introduced  to  address  this  problem,  but  no  legislation  had 
been  passed  by  early  1997.  The  Chamber  of  Deputies  allows 
groups  to  receive  lobbying  credentials.  In  the  1991-92  session, 
thirty-nine  groups  (twenty-eight  business  groups)  received  cre- 
dentials, in  addition  to  all  ministries  and  sixteen  other  public- 
sector  agencies.  The  Senate  does  not  offer  credentials. 

The  Media 

Print  and  electronic  media  play  a  very  important  role  in  Bra- 
zilian politics.  Until  the  1988  constitution,  the  president  had 
the  exclusive  prerogative  to  allocate  radio  and  television  con- 
cessions. From  1985  through  1988,  television  and  radio  conces- 
sions became  the  "currency  of  political  negotiation"  as 
President  Sarney  tried  to  maintain  majorities  in  Congress. 
Although  "social  control"  over  concessions  and  renewals  is 
called  for  in  the  new  constitution,  no  such  action  had  been 
taken  until  Cardoso's  new  minister  of  communications,  Sergio 
Motta,  served  notice  in  1995  that  all  pending  concessions 
would  be  canceled  and  a  National  Social  Control  Commission 
would  be  established  that  would  use  different  criteria. 

Shortly  after  radio  arrived  in  Brazil  in  the  1930s,  President 
Vargas  initiated  weekday  transmissions  of  the  Voice  of  Brazil,  as 
propaganda  on  government  operations.  The  news  show,  which 
emphasizes  activities  in  and  around  government  and  political 
circles,  carries  thirty  minutes  of  news  from  the  executive 
branch  and  thirty  minutes  from  Congress  and  the  judiciary. 

Media  owners  have  very  definite  political  agendas  and  pur- 
sue them  assiduously.  Francisco  de  Assis  Chateaubriand  Ban- 
deira  de  Melo  built  the  first  media  empire  in  Brazil.  He 
founded  the  Diarios  Associados  newspaper  chain  in  the  1930s, 
and  in  the  1950s  established  a  media  empire  that  included 
thirty-three  newspapers,  eighteen  magazines,  the  Tupi  Network 
(with  twenty-five  radio  and  eighteen  television  stations),  and 
two  news  agencies.  Chateaubriand  exercised  tremendous  coer- 
cive power  over  businessmen,  presidents,  governors,  and  Con- 
gress. As  a  result  of  losing  a  political  and  judicial  battle  against 
the  rise  of  the  TV  Globo  Network,  Tupi  deteriorated  after  Cha-

teaubriand's  death  in  1968.  The  military  government  finally 
confiscated  and  reallocated  its  concessions  in  1981.  The  news- 
paper chain  still  exists  but  with  less  central  coordination. 

The  second  media  empire  and  the  most  powerful  one  in 
1997,  Globo  Organizations  (Organizacoes  Globo),  began  with 
the  Rio  newspaper  0  Globo,  founded  by  Irineu  Marinho  in  the 
1920s.  In  1931  the  oldest  son,  Roberto  Marinho,  assumed  con- 
trol of  the  newspaper  and  still  commanded  the  empire  in  1997 
at  age  eighty-five.  Globo  began  radio  transmissions  in  1944, 
and  TV  Globo  began  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1965,  the  latter  under 
a  controversial  technical  assistance  agreement  with  the  Time- 
Life  Group  that  generated  a  CPI. 

With  the  establishment  of  a  microwave  and  later  satellite 
national  hookup  by  the  Brazilian  Telecommunications  Com- 
pany (Empresa  Brasileira  de  Telecomunicacoes — Embratel)  in 
1970,  the  Globo  network  steadily  advanced  to  cover  all  states. 
The  network  accounts  for  approximately  70  percent  of  televi- 
sion audience  ratings  and  advertising  billings  in  Brazil. 

In  1993,  333  daily  newspapers  had  a  total  circulation  of 
about  2.5  million.  Magazines  sold  222  million  copies  in  1993 
(1.47  per  inhabitant),  down  32  percent  from  1991.  Although 
per  capita  newspaper  circulation  and  readership  is  very  low  in 
Brazil,  research  has  shown  that  print  media  have  considerable 
influence  on  politics  because  of  very  competent  investigative 
reporting  and  exposes,  influence  among  "opinion  leaders," 
and  influence  on  other  media.  Of  the  five  national  newspa- 
pers— O  Estado  de  Sao  Paulo,  Folha  de  Sao  Paulo,  Gazeta  Mercantil, 
O  Globo,  and  Jornal  do  Brasil — members  of  Congress  regarded 
Gazeta  Mercantil  as  the  least  biased  paper,  according  to  a  May 
1995  survey. 

Radio  and  especially  television  exert  a  tremendous  direct 
influence  over  the  voting  behavior  of  the  vast  majority  of  Brazil- 
ians. When  the  TSE  (Superior  Electoral  Court)  completed  a 
massive  computerized  voter  registration  before  the  1986  elec- 
tions, it  classified  70  percent  of  those  registered  as  "illiterate  or 
semi-illiterate."  Brazilian  television  has  an  insidious  influence 
on  these  nearly  60  million  voters.  Political  subplots  are  cleverly 
woven  into  television  soap  operas  (telenovelas)  and  situation 
comedies  to  jaundice  public  opinion  about  certain  political 
groups  and  types  of  politicians.  Biased  news  coverage  of  politi- 
cal campaigns  is  commonplace.

Foreign  Relations 

The  Foreign  Service 

The  Rio  Branco  Institute  (Instituto  Rio  Branco — IRBr) 
recruits  from  twenty  to  thirty  candidates  each  year  among  col- 
lege graduates.  After  four  semesters  of  intensive  study  of  lan- 
guage and  diplomacy,  graduates  receive  a  certified  bachelor  of 
arts  degree  in  diplomacy  and  begin  their  careers  as  third  secre- 
taries. In  1996  the  IRBr  began  studies  to  upgrade  the  course  to 
an  M.A.  program.  The  IRBr  teaching  staff  is  composed  of 
senior  diplomats  and  some  academics  from  the  University  of 
Brasilia  (Universidade  de  Brasilia).  Some  foreign  students  are 
admitted,  mostly  from  Latin  America  and  Africa. 

After  three  or  four  years  experience  within  several  divisions 
of  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  (known  as  Itamaraty,  after  the 
building  it  formerly  occupied  in  Rio  de  Janeiro),  the  junior 
diplomat  is  posted  overseas.  Promotion  to  second  and  first  sec- 
retary is  by  merit  (evaluation  by  immediate  superiors).  Before 
promotion  to  minister  second  class,  the  diplomat  goes  through 
a  mid-career  course  and  produces  a  monograph,  which  is 
defended  before  an  examining  board.  Many  diplomats  also 
acquire  graduate  degrees  during  their  career.  Promotion  to  the 
final  positions  of  counselor  (minister  first  class)  and  ambassa- 
dor involves  a  combination  of  merit  and  political  consider- 
ations; the  president  makes  the  final  decision.  Because 
Itamaraty  has  more  diplomats  than  posts  overseas  and  in 
Brasilia,  diplomats  frequently  fill  key  positions  in  other  minis- 
tries, state  enterprises,  and  the  president's  office.  Brazilian  dip- 
lomats generally  are  considered  skilled  and  patient  negotiators 
by  their  peers. 

Foreign  Policy  Decision  Making 

Most  foreign  policy  strategies  and  decisions  originate  within 
Itamaraty.  A  senior  diplomat  always  occupies  the  position  of 
foreign  affairs  adviser  within  the  president's  office,  and  diplo- 
mats occupy  similar  liaison  positions  in  key  ministries.  Since 
the  1980s,  Itamaraty,  in  response  to  the  growing  complexity  of 
foreign  policy  issues,  has  established  new  divisions  dealing  with 
export  promotion,  environmental  affairs,  science  and  technol- 
ogy, and  human  rights.  Itamaraty  also  established  the  Interna- 
tional Relations  Research  Institute  (Instituto  das  Pesquisas  das 
Relacoes  Internacionais — IPRI)  as  part  of  the  Alexandre 


313 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Gusmao  Foundation,  which  functions  as  a  think  tank  and  con- 
ference center  and  publishes  foreign  policy  studies. 

The  Senate  and  Chamber  of  Deputies  each  have  foreign 
affairs  standing  committees.  Under  the  1988  constitution,  the 
Senate  expanded  its  treaty  approval  prerogative  to  include  all 
international  financial  agreements,  such  as  negotiations  with 
the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see  Glossary)  and 
international  banks,  which  in  the  past  had  been  the  exclusive 
prerogative  of  the  executive  branch  (see  The  Military  in  the 
Amazon,  ch.  5).  The  Congress  also  has  involved  itself  in  major 
government  contracts  with  foreign  companies,  such  as  the  con- 
tract with  Raytheon  for  an  Amazon  surveillance  system. 

The  Brazilian  Cooperation  Agency  (Agenda  Brasileira  de 
Cooperacao — ABC),  a  foreign  aid  agency  formally  established 
in  the  late  1980s,  coordinates  all  international  technical  coop- 
eration and  assistance  received  by  Brazil  from  foreign  donors 
(often,  but  not  always,  within  the  context  of  bilateral  agree- 
ments). For  example,  in  the  absence  of  a  United  States-Brazil 
bilateral  agreement,  United  States  Agency  for  International 
Development  (USAID)  programs  in  Brazil  are  not  coordinated 
through  the  ABC.  The  ABC  also  coordinates  Brazilian  interna- 
tional technical  cooperation  and  assistance  directed  to  other 
countries,  mostly  through  South-South  relationships  con- 
ducted by  Brazilian  government  agencies,  universities,  and 
NGOs. 

At  times  other  agencies  may  take  the  lead  in  foreign  policy 
decision  making.  For  example,  in  June  1995  the  economic  sec- 
tor, led  by  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  made  the  initial  decision  to 
impose  quotas  on  imported  automobiles.  This  decision  pro- 
voked a  crisis  within  the  Common  Market  of  the  South  (Mer- 
cado  Comum  do  Sul — Mercosul;  see  Glossary) — because 
Argentine  automobile  exports  to  Brazil  would  have  been 
affected.  Itamaraty  intervened,  and  a  solution  was  negotiated 
excepting  Mercosul  from  the  rigors  of  the  measure. 

The  military  had  the  final  say  on  foreign  policy  during  the 
1964-85  period,  when  foreign  policy  was  decided  frequently 
within  the  National  Security  Council  (Conselho  de  Seguranca 
Nacional — CSN).  Since  then  the  military  occasionally  has  exer- 
cised some  influence.  When  the  United  Nations  (UN) 
requested  Brazilian  troops  for  a  peacekeeping  force  in 
Namibia  during  the  delicate,  pre-election  phase  of  transition  in 
1991,  Itamaraty  was  favorable,  but  the  army  vetoed  the  initia- 
tive. The  reverse  occurred  in  1995.  After  a  successful  peace-

Government  and  Politics 


keeping  mission  in  Mozambique  in  1993-94,  the  army,  in 
search  of  new  missions,  approved  sending  a  battalion  to  the 
peacekeeping  operation  in  Angola.  However,  for  reasons  of 
economic  austerity  the  ministries  of  Planning  and  Finance 
delayed  the  appropriation  until  1996. 

Multilateral  Relations 

Brazil  was  a  founding  member  of  the  League  of  Nations  (see 
Glossary)  in  1920  and  the  UN  in  1945,  and  has  chaired  the  UN 
Security  Council  on  several  occasions.  Brazil  is  also  an  active 
participant  in  the  Organization  of  American  States  (OAS;  see 
Glossary),  IMF,  World  Bank  (see  Glossary),  Inter-American 
Development  Bank  (IADB;  see  Glossary),  African  Develop- 
ment Bank  (ADB),  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO,  which 
now  administers  the  General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and 
Trade — GATT;  see  Glossary),  International  Commodity  Orga- 
nization (coffee,  cocoa  beans),  and  Antarctic  Treaty.  Interna- 
tional pressures  have  been  strong  on  Brazil  to  join  certain 
agreements,  such  as  the  Non-Proliferation  Treaty  (NPT),  which 
Brazil  announced  its  decision  to  sign  on  June  20,  1997.  Brazil 
joined  the  Missile  Technology  Control  Regime  (MTCR — see 
Glossary)  in  October  1995. 

Brazil  has  participated  in  UN  peacekeeping  operations  since 
the  Suez  Crisis  in  1956.  A  Brazilian  contingent  participated  in 
the  UN  observer  force  that  guaranteed  the  October  1994  elec- 
tions in  Mozambique,  and  in  the  UN  observer  force  in  Bosnia 
in  1995.  Regarding  the  latter,  a  Brazilian  general  commanded  a 
force  of  680  observers,  of  whom  thirty-four  were  Brazilians.  In 
May  1995,  two  Brazilian  officers  were  among  the  several  hun- 
dred UN  observers  captured  by  the  Bosnian  Serbs  and  used  as 
human  shields  against  further  NATO  bombings.  The  number 
of  Brazilian  personnel  attached  to  UN  peacekeeping  opera- 
tions has  gradually  declined  from  1,166  in  August  1996  to  forty- 
eight  in  September  1997.  Because  of  its  active  participation  in 
UN  activities  and  its  status  as  a  middle-level  emerging  eco- 
nomic and  political  power,  Brazil  aspires  to  a  permanent  seat 
on  the  Security  Council,  if  and  when  membership  in  this  body 
is  expanded. 

Latin  America 

Brazil's  first  circle  of  international  relations  is  with  its  Latin 
American  neighbors.  Being  the  largest  nation  in  the  region 
makes  this  process  somewhat  delicate.  Most  border  issues  were 


315 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

settled  in  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries,  but 
some  questions  concerning  the  borders  with  Bolivia,  Colom- 
bia, Paraguay,  and  Venezuela  remain.  In  1995  Brazilian  farmers 
and  forest  gatherers  penetrated  Bolivia's  Pando  Department, 
in  an  action  reminiscent  of  the  invasion  of  Acre  by  Brazilian 
rubber  tappers  in  the  1890s.  Brazil  regularly  extends  export 
credits  and  university  scholarships  to  its  Latin  American  neigh- 
bors. A  certain  quota  of  Latin  Americans  are  admitted  to  the 
Rio  Branco  Institute  and  the  armed  forces  staff  schools. 

An  active  participant  in  regional  security  activities,  Brazil 
hosted  the  conference  that  established  the  Inter-American 
Treaty  of  Reciprocal  Assistance  (Rio  Treaty)  in  1947.  In  addi- 
tion, Brazil  was  a  founding  member  of  the  OAS  in  1948  and  has 
participated  in  several  OAS  peacekeeping  endeavors.  Most 
notable  was  Brazil's  participation  in  the  Inter-American  Peace 
Force  (Fuerzas  Interamericanas  de  Paz — FIP)  in  the  Domini- 
can Republic  in  1965.  In  the  1980s,  Brazil  was  an  active  partici- 
pant in  the  Contadora  Support  Group  (see  Glossary),  which 
sought  a  permanent  peace  in  Central  America.  In  June  1995, 
eighty-seven  Brazilians  were  attached  to  peacekeeping  opera- 
tions in  the  Americas — thirty-seven  in  El  Salvador,  thirty-two  in 
Nicaragua,  ten  on  the  Ecuador/Peru  border,  six  in  Honduras, 
and  two  in  Guatemala. 

The  Treaty  of  Asuncion — signed  in  1991  by  Brazil,  Argen- 
tina, Uruguay,  and  Paraguay — was  the  culmination  of  a  rap- 
prochement betwreen  Brazil  and  Argentina  after  160  years  of 
regional  rivalry  (see  Trade  Patterns  and  Regional  Economic 
Integration,  ch.  3).  It  also  incorporated  Uruguay  and  Paraguay 
into  Mercosul,  and  Bolivia  and  Chile  joined  Mercosul  in  1996. 

Europe 

During  the  period  from  the  1970s  to  1995,  the  relative 
importance  of  the  European  Economic  Community  (EEC;  now 
the  European  Union — EU)  as  a  trading  partner  with  Brazil  was 
reduced,  but  increased  in  the  mid-1990s.  By  1995  German 
investments  in  Brazil  were  second  only  to  the  United  States,  but 
Britain,  Italy,  and  France  also  have  important  investments, 
mostly  in  industrial  manufacturing,  heavy  equipment  and  auto- 
mobiles, and  consumer  goods.  In  mid-1995  negotiations 
advanced  toward  establishing  a  free-trade  association  between 
the  EU  and  Mercosul.  In  December  1995,  the  EU  signed  an 
important  free-trade  protocol  with  Mercosul,  the  first  ever 
between  two  regional  trading  blocs.  Since  then  Brazil  has 


316 


A  Brazilian  Air  Force  Hercules  C-130  transport  plane

adroitly  used  the  EU  card  to  force  a  slowdown  of  the  United 
States  pressure  to  "fast  track"  the  Free  Trade  Area  of  the  Amer- 
icas (FTAA)  expansion  of  the  North  American  Free  Trade 
Agreement  (NAFTA). 

Relations  with  the  EU  are  economically  important,  but  even 
more  so  from  a  North-South  political  perspective.  Brazil  and  its 
Mercosul  partners  want  to  strengthen  their  trading  bloc  to 
include  not  only  Chile  but  also  Bolivia,  Colombia,  Ecuador, 
Peru,  and  Venezuela  before  2005,  to  be  able  to  negotiate  as  a 
bloc  with  NAFTA,  as  opposed  to  bilateral  negotiations  as 
favored  by  the  administration  of  President  William  Jefferson 
Clinton.  The  United  States  view  is  that  2005  is  the  date  for  the 
FTAA  to  be  "fully  operational,"  whereas  Brazil  and  its  Mercosul 
partners  view  the  year  2005  as  a  "starting  point"  for  the  FTAA 
process. 

The  Middle  East 

Immigrants  from  the  Middle  East  began  arriving  in  Brazil  in 
large  numbers  in  the  twentieth  century,  especially  following 
World  War  I.  These  immigrants  spread  throughout  Brazil  but 


317 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

can  be  found  mostly  in  the  Southeast  region,  where  many  are 
merchants. 

Brazil's  economic  relations  with  the  Middle  East  were  accel- 
erated by  the  1973  petroleum  crisis.  Brazil  tried  to  maintain  a 
moderate  stance  vis-a-vis  the  Arab-Israeli  conflict  and  sup- 
ported all  UN  peace  initiatives.  In  late  1973,  Brazil  established 
embassies  in  Iraq  and  Saudi  Arabia  and  legations  in  Libya  and 
Kuwait,  and  it  signed  cooperation  agreements  with  Egypt, 
Israel,  and  Iraq. 

However,  in  1975,  because  of  the  deepening  petroleum  crisis 
and  in  search  of  petrodollar  investments,  Brazil  tilted  its  for- 
eign policy  in  favor  of  the  Arab  (Palestinian)  cause  in  three 
crucial  votes  in  the  UN.  Brazil's  military  government  upgraded 
its  representation  in  Iraq  by  appointing  a  succession  of  four- 
star  generals  as  ambassadors  to  Baghdad.  When  the  Iran-Iraq 
War  broke  out  in  1979,  nearly  35  percent  of  Brazil's  oil  imports 
were  coming  from  Iraq.  In  1981  it  was  reported  that  Brazil  had 
sold  low-grade  uranium  ore  or  yellow  cake  (see  Glossary)  to 
Iraq. 

The  Iraq-Kuwait  conflict,  which  resulted  in  Operation 
Desert  Storm  in  early  1991,  placed  Brazil  in  a  very  delicate  posi- 
tion. United  States  congressional  subcommittees  accused  Bra- 
zil of  exporting  technology  and  expertise  to  Iraq  to  develop  a 
missile  based  on  the  Piranha  missile  (MAA-1).  Retired  Air 
Force  Brigadier  Hugo  Oliveira  Piva  had  taken  a  private  group 
of  Brazilian  technicians  to  Baghdad  to  complete  this  project; 
under  pressure,  the  Collor  government  ordered  the  group's 
return  to  Brazil. 

At  the  time  of  Desert  Storm,  a  Brazilian  construction  com- 
pany, Mendes  Junior,  had  several  hundred  workers  and  techni- 
cians, as  well  as  several  million  dollars  worth  of  equipment,  in 
southern  Iraq  working  on  railroad  and  irrigation  projects. 
Thus,  Brazil,  unlike  Argentina,  did  not  participate  in  the  Allied 
operation.  The  Brazilian  government  had  to  dispatch  its  key 
negotiator,  Ambassador  Paulo  de  Tarso  Flecha  de  Lima,  from 
his  post  in  London  to  negotiate  the  release  of  the  Mendes 
Junior  personnel  from  Iraq  and  the  disposition  of  the  equip- 
ment. Brazil  had  won  a  US$5  billion  price  and  performance 
competition  to  supply  its  Osorio  tank  to  Saudi  Arabia  in  1990, 
but  the  Kuwait  conflict  changed  the  decision  in  favor  of  the 
United  States  Abrams  tank.

Government  and  Politics 


Africa 

Brazil's  relations  with  Africa  date  from  the  beginning  of  the 
slave  trade  in  the  seventeenth  century.  By  the  middle  of  the 
nineteenth  century,  many  former  slaves  had  returned  to  West 
Africa  and  had  become  prosperous  merchants  and  entrepre- 
neurs, and  regular  shipping  lines  and  commerce  flourished 
from  Bahia.  After  1945  Brazil  maintained  a  low-profile  position 
in  the  anticolonialism  debate  in  the  UN,  but  supported  the 
positions  of  Portugal,  Belgium,  France,  and  Britain.  In  1961 
President  Janio  Quadros's  new  independent  foreign  policy 
made  some  timid  advances  in  favor  of  independence  for  the 
remaining  colonies  in  Africa.  During  the  Goulart  period 
(1961-64),  Brazil  took  contradictory  positions,  especially 
regarding  Portugal.  Brazil's  main  contacts  with  the  newly  inde- 
pendent nations  of  West  Africa  involved  price-fixing  attempts 
within  the  International  Coffee  Organization.  The  Castelo 
Branco  administration  (1964-67)  sent  two  commercial  mis- 
sions to  Africa,  the  Costa  e  Silva  administration  (1967-69) 
opened  an  embassy  in  Abidjan  (Cote  d'lvoire)  and  one  in  Kin- 
shasa (Zaire). 

Nonetheless,  the  opening  to  Africa  really  began  during  the 
presidency  of  Emflio  Garrastazu  Medici  (1969-74).  In  Novem- 
ber 1972,  Foreign  Minister  Mario  Gibson  Barbosa  visited  nine 
West  African  countries.  In  1973  Brazil  voted  in  favor  of  antico- 
lonialism measures  in  the  UN.  This  vote  and  follow-up  trade 
missions  resulted  in  numerous  bilateral  agreements  and  Bra- 
zil's participation  in  the  ADB  (African  Development  Bank). 
South  African  companies  made  considerable  investments  in 
Brazil,  especially  in  mining.  Brazil's  exports  to  Africa  jumped 
from  US$90.4  million  in  1972  to  US$1.96  billion  in  1981,  and 
its  imports  from  US$152.9  million  to  US$1.98  billion. 

Brazil's  opening  to  Africa  was  consolidated  during  the  Geisel 
period  (1974-79),  which  coincided  with  the  emancipation  of 
the  five  Portuguese  colonies  in  Africa.  Brazil  recognized  the 
independence  of  Guinea-Bissau  and  Cape  Verde  in  July  1974, 
before  it  was  conceded  by  Portugal.  In  November  1975,  Brazil 
became  the  first  Western  nation  to  recognize  the  indepen- 
dence of  Angola,  under  the  revolutionary  government  of  the 
Popular  Movement  for  the  Liberation  of  Angola  (Movimento 
Popular  de  Libertacao  de  Angola — MPLA),  and  to  establish  an 
embassy  in  Luanda.  Brazil's  stance  caused  much  consternation 
for  the  United  States  because  the  MPLA  government  in  Angola 
was  socialist  and  dependent  on  the  communist  bloc  and  Cuba 


319 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

at  that  time.  That  same  month,  Brazil  established  relations  with 
the  government  in  Mozambique  because  of  its  strategic  impor- 
tance in  southern  East  Africa  and  the  Indian  Ocean.  Within 
the  context  of  the  Cold  War  and  Brazil's  anticommunist  mili- 
tary government,  this  decision  was  a  bold  move  on  the  part  of 
the  Geisel  government.  However,  Brazil  placed  considerable 
importance  on  establishing  relations  with  African  countries.  It 
was  hard  hit  by  the  1973-74  petroleum  crisis  and  desired  access 
to  West  African  oil  exports  in  particular.  The  petrodollars  thus 
earned  were  used  to  buy  Brazilian  exports  of  manufactured 
goods  through  Petrobras  International  Trade,  Inc.  (Petrobras 
Comercio  Internacional  S.A. — Interbras). 

Over  the  next  twenty  years,  Brazil  established  very  close  rela- 
tions with  the  lusophone  or  Portuguese-Speaking  African 
Countries  (Paises  Africanos  de  Lingua  Oficial  Portuguesa — 
PALOPs).  In  addition  to  Angola  and  Mozambique,  these 
included  Sao  Tome  e  Principe,  Cabo  Verde,  and  Guinea-Bissau. 
The  Rio  Grande  do  Sul  Airline  (Viacao  Aerea  Rio-Grandense 
do  Sul — Varig)  established  regular  flights  to  Lagos,  Nigeria; 
Abidjan;  Luanda,  Angola;  and  Maputo,  Mozambique.  However, 
in  the  early  1990s  flights  were  suspended  to  Lagos  (to  control 
drug  traffic)  and  Maputo.  President  Figueiredo  (1974-85)  was 
the  first  Brazilian  president  to  visit  Africa  (five  countries  in 
November  1983).  Brazilian  construction  companies  undertook 
hydroelectric  and  infrastructure  projects,  and  Petrobras  signed 
risk  contracts  for  oil  exploration. 

By  1986  Brazil  had  twenty-two  embassies  in  the  region,  and 
President  Sarney  continued  the  expansion  of  relations  with 
Africa,  visiting  Cape  Verde  in  1986  and  Angola  in  1989.  African 
heads  of  state  from  Algeria,  Zaire,  Cape  Verde,  and  Mozam- 
bique, as  well  as  Sam  Nujoma  of  the  South  West  African  Peo- 
ple's Organization  (SWAPO),  also  visited  Brasilia.  By  1985 
commerce  between  Africa  and  Brazil  had  grown  to  US$3.3  bil- 
lion. 

In  the  context  of  the  independence  of  Namibia  in  1990,  the 
UN  requested  a  Brazilian  battalion  to  participate  in  peacekeep- 
ing operations,  but  Brazil  refused,  saying  that  the  army  was  not 
prepared  and  the  government  lacked  resources  for  such  a  ven- 
ture. However,  when  the  UN  asked  for  Brazilian  army  and 
police  participants  in  peacekeeping  operations  during  the 
October  1994  election  in  Mozambique,  the  Itamar  Franco  gov- 
ernment was  quick  to  oblige.  In  1995  the  Cardoso  government 
sent  a  full  engineering  battalion  to  Angola  to  participate  in  UN

operations  (minesweeping  and  infrastructure  rebuilding).  In 
1996  President  Cardoso  made  a  short  visit  to  Angola  en  route 
to  a  longer  state  visit  to  South  Africa. 

Asia 

Before  1960  Brazil  maintained  diplomatic  relations  with 
three  Asian  nations:  Japan,  India,  and  Nationalist  China  (Tai- 
wan). In  that  year,  Brazil  established  ties  with  the  Republic  of 
Korea  (South  Korea)  and  Ceylon  (now  Sri  Lanka).  In  August 
1961,  President  Quadros  sent  his  vice  president,  Joao  Goulart, 
to  the  People's  Republic  of  China  as  head  of  a  commercial  del- 
egation. In  August  1974,  Brazil  broke  relations  with  Taiwan  and 
established  full  relations  with  China,  four  years  before  the 
United  States.  The  Nationalist  diplomats  were  evicted  uncere- 
moniously from  the  Chinese  embassy  in  Brasilia  to  make  way 
for  the  new  tenants. 

In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  relations  with  Asia  expanded  to  ten 
embassies  in  Brasilia.  Because  of  the  growing  importance  of 
the  newly  industrialized  countries  in  the  Pacific  Basin,  Brazil 
installed  a  legation  in  Singapore.  Although  not  a  major  trading 
partner,  India  became  an  important  South-South  ally  in  inter- 
national forums,  such  as  the  UN  Conference  on  Trade  and 
Development  (UNCTAD),  GATT,  and  the  Group  of  77  (G-77). 

With  its  gradual  economic  opening  to  the  West,  mainland 
China  has  become  an  important  trading  partner  for  Brazil 
since  the  1980s.  Petrobras  began  oil  exploration  under  risk 
contract,  and  engineering  services  were  contracted  for  mining 
and  hydroelectric  ventures.  In  addition,  the  Chinese  have  pur- 
chased large  quantities  of  Brazilian  iron  ore  and  steel  plate. 

However,  Japan  has  received  the  highest  priority  within  the 
region.  Brazil  established  diplomatic  relations  with  Japan  in 
1897.  The  first  Japanese  immigrants  arrived  in  Brazil  in  1908, 
as  the  Sao  Paulo  coffee  planters  sought  alternative  free  labor 
after  the  abolition  of  slavery  in  1888.  This  influx  of  Japanese 
immigrants  continued  until  1934,  when  the  new  constitution 
limited  foreign  immigration  to  2  percent  of  the  past  fifty  years. 
Diplomatic  relations  broke  off  during  World  War  II,  but 
resumed  in  1952.  Some  100  years  after  the  first  waves  of  immi- 
gration, Brazilians  of  Japanese  descent  constitute  one  of  the 
largest  ethnic  segments  of  Brazil's  population. 

In  the  1960s,  Japan  began  to  invest  heavily  in  various  sectors 
in  Brazil,  including  mining,  steel,  aluminum,  telecommunica- 
tions, manufacturing,  and  agricultural  ventures  (the  latter  in 


322 


Government  and  Politics 


the  Central  Highlands  plateau  region  and  the  Amazon).  In 
return,  Japan  imported  large  quantities  of  iron,  other  nonfer- 
rous  ores,  unfinished  steel  and  aluminum  products,  and  soy- 
beans and  other  agricultural  products. 

In  the  1980s,  with  cycles  of  recession  and  decreasing  employ- 
ment opportunities  in  Brazil,  a  reverse  immigration  flux  began; 
some  200,000  Brazilians  of  Japanese  descent  traveled  to  Japan 
in  search  of  jobs.  Their  monthly  remittances  to  their  families 
remaining  in  Brazil  have  become  an  important  item  in  bilateral 
commerce. 

In  1992  Japanese  companies  invested  US$1.4  billion  in  Bra- 
zil in  the  areas  of  telecommunications,  capital  goods,  mining, 
and  metallurgy.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency 
(JICA)  has  sponsored  many  rural  colonization  projects  in  Bra- 
zil since  the  1950s.  In  1995 JICA  was  using  Brazilian  technicians 
and  installations  to  train  people  from  developing  countries  in 
Latin  America  and  Africa  in  industrial  job  training,  community 
development,  education,  and  so  forth. 

In  mid-1995  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Vietnam  signaled  a 
desire  for  closer  trade  relations  with  Brazil,  thus  eliminating 
Thailand  as  middleman.  President  General  Le  Due  Anh  visited 
Brazil  and  the  Brazilian  foreign  minister  visited  Vietnam  in  the 
second  half  of  1995.  Brazil's  opening  to  Vietnam  was  made 
within  the  context  of  Brazil's  general  Southeast  Asian  strategy 
and  its  view  that  Vietnam  may  soon  become  an  "Asian  Tiger." 

United  States 

The  United  States  was  the  first  nation  to  establish  a  consu- 
late in  Brazil  in  1808,  following  the  transfer  of  the  Portuguese 
royal  court  to  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  the  subsequent  opening  of 
the  ports  to  foreign  ships.  However,  it  was  not  until  after  World 
War  II  that  the  United  States  became  Brazil's  number-one  trad- 
ing partner  and  foreign  investor.  After  1945  United  States-Bra- 
zil relations  took  on  five  basic  dimensions:  promoting  and 
protecting  United  States  investments  in  and  exports  to  Brazil; 
promoting  Brazil's  exports  of  primary  goods  or  products  (see 
Glossary)  and  supporting  Brazil's  industrialization  policies;  gar- 
nering Brazil's  support  for  United  States  policy  positions  in  the 
hemisphere  and  in  other  world  forums;  promoting  Brazil's 
emergence  as  a  middle-level  world  power  in  Latin  America  and 
the  developing  world;  and  showcasing  Brazil's  successful  inde- 
pendent foreign  policy  and  autonomous  development  strategy 
among  its  peers  in  the  developing  world. 


323 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

During  the  presidency  of  Enrico  Gaspar  Dutra  (1946-51), 
Brazil's  foreign  policy  was  aligned  closely  with  that  of  the 
United  States.  Brazil  outlawed  the  PCB  (Brazilian  Communist 
Party)  in  1947  and  broke  off  relations  with  the  Soviet  Union. 
Vargas's  return  to  power  in  1951  signaled  a  cooling  of  rela- 
tions. Vargas  blamed  the  United  States  for  his  ouster  in  1945 
and  appealed  to  Brazilian  nationalism,  which  was  growing  in 
many  sectors,  including  the  armed  forces.  The  Korean  War  and 
the  European  recovery  were  then  high  United  States  priorities. 
Brazil  was  not  at  the  time  threatened  by  communism,  and 
United  States  arms  sale  policies  equated  formerly  pro-Axis 
Argentina  with  Brazil.  Brazil's  foreign  policy  of  actively  promot- 
ing its  agricultural  exports,  whose  terms  of  trade  (see  Glossary) 
were  diminishing,  ran  counter  to  United  States  interests.  The 
establishment  of  the  Petrobras  oil  monopoly  in  1953  crowned 
these  nationalist  sentiments  and  was  hailed  as  an  economic 
declaration  of  independence  from  United  States  oil  compa- 
nies. These  sentiments  were  further  fanned  by  charges  of 
United  States  involvement  in  Vargas's  ouster  and  suicide  in 
August  1954.  His  suicide  note  blamed  "international  economic 
and  financial  groups." 

President  Kubitschek  (1956-61)  improved  relations  with  the 
United  States,  while  strengthening  relations  with  Latin  Amer- 
ica and  Europe,  and  exploring  market  possibilities  in  Eastern 
Europe.  His  industrial  development  policy  attracted  huge 
direct  investments  by  foreign  capital,  much  from  the  United 
States.  He  proposed  an  ambitious  plan  for  United  States  devel- 
opment aid  to  Latin  America  in  1958  (Operation  Panamerica). 
The  outgoing  administration  of  President  Dwight  D.  Eisen- 
hower found  the  plan  of  no  interest,  but  the  administration  of 
President  John  F.  Kennedy  appropriated  funds  in  1961  for  the 
Alliance  for  Progress  (see  Glossary) . 

Relations  again  cooled  slightly  after  President  Quadros 
announced  his  new  independent  foreign  policy  in  January 
1961.  Quadros  also  made  overtures  to  Cuba  and  decorated 
Cuban  revolutionary  Ernesto  "Che"  Guevara  with  Brazil's  high- 
est honor. 

Severe  economic  problems,  political  and  economic  national- 
ism, union  populism,  and  strained  relations  with  the  United 
States  frustrated  President  Goulart,  eventually  causing  his  over- 
throw in  1964.  Before  assuming  the  presidency,  Goulart  was 
known  for  having  been  a  Vargas  protege  and  for  being  pro- 
Fidel  Castro,  procommunist,  and  antiforeign  capital.  However, 


324 


Government  and  Politics 


during  the  first  parliamentary  period  (September  1961  to  Feb- 
ruary 1963)  of  his  presidency,  Goulart  tried  to  maintain  close 
relations  with  the  United  States  by  naming  strongly  pro-United 
States  Roberto  Campos  as  ambassador  in  Washington  and  Dep- 
uty Santiago  Dantas  as  minister  of  foreign  affairs.  Nonetheless, 
certain  domestic  and  foreign  policy  issues  clouded  this  rela- 
tionship. First,  Goulart's  brother-in-law,  Leonel  Brizola,  then 
governor  of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  insisted  on  expropriation  of 
foreign-owned  public  utilities  (electric  power  and  telephones), 
and  nationalists  in  Congress  pushed  for  zero  or  minimum  com- 
pensation. Second,  Brazil  joined  Argentina,  Bolivia,  Chile, 
Ecuador,  and  Mexico  in  abstaining  from  a  final  vote  on  an  OAS 
resolution  expelling  Cuba  from  that  organization.  Third,  in 
August  1962,  Congress  approved  a  more  restrictive  law  govern- 
ing profit  remittances,  and  new  foreign  investments  dwindled 
to  almost  zero  in  early  1964. 

In  late  1963,  Washington,  alarmed  that  Brazil  might  become 
a  hostile,  nonaligned  power  like  Egypt,  reduced  foreign  aid  to 
Brazil.  The  exact  United  States  role  in  the  March  31,  1964,  mil- 
itary coup  that  overthrew  Goulart  remains  controversial.  How- 
ever, the  United  States  immediately  recognized  the  new 
interim  government  (before  Goulart  had  even  fled  Brazilian 
territory);  a  United  States  naval  task  force  anchored  close  to 
the  port  of  Vitoria;  the  United  States  made  an  immediate  large 
loan  to  the  new  Castelo  Branco  government  (1964-67);  and 
the  new  military  president  adopted  a  policy  of  total  alignment 
with  the  United  States. 

The  Castelo  Branco  regime  broke  off  relations  with  Cuba 
(while  enhancing  them  with  the  Soviet  Union  and  Eastern 
Europe);  purged  or  exiled  leftists  and  alleged  communists; 
adopted  a  more  discreet  position  in  the  UN  vis-a-vis  Portuguese 
colonialism;  duly  compensated  expropriated  foreign  capital 
investments;  passed  a  new  profit  remittances  law;  and  sent  a 
1,200-man  battalion  as  part  of  the  Interamerican  Peace  Force 
to  the  Dominican  Republic  in  1965.  Brazilian  foreign  policy 
centered  on  combating  subversion  and  contributing  to  the  col- 
lective security  of  the  hemisphere.  Brazil  ranked  third  after 
Vietnam  and  India  as  recipients  of  United  States  aid;  it  received 
US$2  billion  from  1964  to  1970.  Nonetheless,  Castelo  Branco's 
all-out  support  for  United  States  policies  only  served  to 
increase  anti-Americanism  rather  than  to  lessen  it. 

Divergence  and  some  hostility  characterized  relations  dur- 
ing the  Costa  e  Silva  period  (1967-69).  Brazil  perceived  that 


325 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

United  States  leadership  in  the  global  struggle  was  faltering 
because  of  the  winding  down  in  Vietnam,  making  it  more  diffi- 
cult for  Brazil  to  support  United  States  positions  in  world 
forums.  In  1969  the  Richard  M.  Nixon  administration  assumed 
a  low-profile  policy  with  Latin  America.  Washington  provided 
less  economic  aid  and  fewer  arms  shipments  to  Brazil  and 
sharply  reduced  its  military  mission  in  Brazil  (from  200  in  1968 
to  sixty  in  1971). 

Although  Costa  e  Silva  did  not  turn  to  economic  nationalism 
and  the  climate  for  foreign  investments  remained  generally 
favorable,  Brazil  asserted  its  independence  in  other  ways.  It 
withdrew  support  from  the  Interamerican  Peace  Force, 
declined  to  sign  the  NPT  (Non-Proliferation  Treaty),  tried  to 
organize  a  Latin  American  nuclear  community,  assumed  a  lead- 
ership role  in  the  nonaligned  G-77,  and  increased  Soviet-Bra- 
zilian trade.  Nevertheless,  Costa  e  Silva  paid  a  state  visit  to 
Washington  in  1967,  and  in  1969  Brazil  sided  with  the  United 
States  against  the  nationalization  of  oil  properties  by  the  Peru- 
vian military  government. 

The  Medici  and  Geisel  governments  (1969-79)  generally  fol- 
lowed the  same  course  of  increasingly  independent  foreign 
policy  combined  with  friendly  relations  with  the  United  States. 
Brazil  sought  to  pursue  its  own  advantages  by  leaving  open  its 
nuclear  options,  greatly  expanding  trade  with  the  Eastern  Bloc, 
recognizing  the  Beijing  government  four  years  before  the 
United  States  normalized  relations  with  mainland  China,  and 
asserting  a  322-kilometer  maritime  zone  (always  referred  to  by 
Brazilians  as  "200  miles")  contrary  to  United  States  policy  and 
fishing  interests. 

Brazil's  policies  emphasized  North-South  issues  over  the 
East-West  conflict.  Brazil  took  the  lead  in  organizing  commod- 
ity cartels  (coffee,  sugar,  and  cocoa).  In  1975  Brazil  voted  for 
the  UN  resolution  equating  Zionism  with  racism  and  did  not 
condemn  the  Soviet  and  Cuban  intervention  in  Angola. 

The  Nixon  administration  remained  basically  sympathetic  to 
Brazilian  hopes  for  growth  and  world  power  status,  and  consid- 
ered Brazil  to  be  one  of  the  developing  world  nations  most 
sympathetic  to  the  United  States.  In  February  1976,  Secretary 
of  State  Henry  Kissinger  and  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs 
Antonio  Azeredo  da  Silveira  signed  a  memorandum  of  under- 
standing that  the  two  powers  would  consult  on  all  issues  of 
mutual  concern  and  would  hold  semiannual  meetings  of  for- 
eign ministers.  Brazil  had  signed  similar  agreements  with  Brit-

ain,  France,  and  Italy  in  1975.  Only  Brazil  and  Saudi  Arabia, 
aside  from  the  major  Western  allies,  had  such  an  agreement 
with  the  United  States.  Although  these  agreements  had  no 
great  practical  consequences,  they  indicated  a  changed  United 
States  policy  of  wooing  Brazil. 

The  Carter  administration  marked  a  definite  cooling  of 
United  States-Brazil  relations.  The  confrontation  involved  two 
very  sensitive  issues — human  rights  and  nuclear  proliferation. 
In  1967  Brazil  had  signed  a  contract  with  Westinghouse  to 
build  a  626-megawatt  nuclear  power  station  at  Angra  dos  Reis, 
Rio  de  Janeiro  State,  to  be  completed  in  1977.  In  1973-74  the 
petroleum  crisis  jolted  Brazil  into  a  high-priority  policy  of  seek- 
ing alternative  energy  sources  (hydro,  solar,  alcohol,  biogas, 
Bolivian  natural  gas,  and  nuclear) .  However,  the  United  States 
Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  renounced  its  guarantee  of 
delivery  of  enriched  uranium,  casting  doubts  on  the  value  of 


327 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

nuclear  cooperation  with  the  United  States,  which  had  prohib- 
ited Westinghouse  from  constructing  enrichment  and  repro- 
cessing plants  in  Brazil. 

Brazil,  desiring  independent  control  of  the  full  cycle  from 
ore  to  kilowatts,  signed  a  broad  nuclear  agreement  with  West 
Germany  in  June  1975.  It  involved  furnishing  technology  and 
equipment  for  eight  nuclear  power  plants,  plus  enrichment 
and  reprocessing  facilities.  Despite  safeguard  provisions,  some 
thought  this  agreement  opened  the  door  for  Brazil  to  con- 
struct nuclear  weapons,  if  desired.  The  Ford  administration 
reacted  only  mildly  to  the  agreement,  but  from  his  first  day  in 
office,  President  Carter  sought  to  prevent  its  implementation. 

In  1975  the  United  States  Congress  mandated  that  the 
Department  of  State  produce  a  general  report  on  human 
rights  performance  by  all  recipients  of  United  States  military 
assistance.  The  section  of  the  report  dealing  with  Brazil  noted 
some  improvements  and  described  violations  as  mildly  as  possi- 
ble. This  report  might  have  gone  unnoticed  if  the  United 
States  Embassy  had  not  delivered  a  copy  to  the  Foreign  Office 
in  Brasilia  just  hours  before  its  release  in  Washington.  This  ges- 
ture, intended  as  a  courtesy,  was  interpreted  as  an  intolerable 
interference  in  Brazil's  internal  affairs.  The  next  day,  Brazil 
renounced  the  United  States-Brazil  Military  Assistance  Agree- 
ment, which  had  been  in  effect  since  1952,  and  some  military 
nationalists  pushed  for  breaking  diplomatic  relations.  Formal 
relations  between  the  two  military  organizations  have  still  not 
been  reestablished. 

The  Reagan  administration  made  ostensible  gestures  to 
improve  relations  with  Brazil.  A  former  military  attache  to  Bra- 
zil during  the  1964  coup,  retired  General  Vernon  Walters  was 
dispatched  to  Brasilia  to  express  United  States  concern  over 
the  Cuban-supported  guerrilla  movement  in  El  Salvador  and  to 
request  support  and  assistance.  Brazil  listened  politely,  but 
then  refused  to  join  the  military  governments  of  Argentina, 
Uruguay,  and  Chile  in  support  of  the  Salvadoran  government. 
Moreover,  it  increased  trade  credits  to  Nicaragua  and  signed 
several  large  trade  agreements  with  the  Soviet  Union. 

In  the  early  1980s,  tension  in  United  States-Brazil  relations 
centered  on  economic  questions.  Retaliation  for  unfair  trade 
practices  loomed  on  the  horizon  and  threatened  Brazilian 
exports  of  steel,  orange  juice,  commuter  aircraft,  frozen  chick- 
ens, shoes,  and  textiles.  The  United  States  criticized  Brazil  for 
its  trade  restrictions  and  unfair  practices  (in  the  area  of  phar- 


328 


Government  and  Politics 


maceutical  patents  and  restrictions  on  United  States  computer 
giants),  and  for  its  US$5  billion  trade  surplus  with  the  United 
States.  Brazil  replied  that  it  needed  desperately  to  maintain 
large  balance  of  payments  surpluses  to  meet  its  foreign  debt 
obligations. 

When  President  Sarney  took  office  in  March  1985,  political 
issues,  such  as  Brazil's  arms  exports  to  Libya  and  Iran,  again 
surfaced.  Brazil's  foreign  debt  moratorium  and  its  refusal  to 
sign  the  NPT  caused  the  United  States  Congress  to  put  Brazil 
on  its  mandated  blacklist,  thereby  restricting  Brazil's  access  to 
certain  United  States  technologies  (see  Nuclear  Programs,  ch. 
6).  On  taking  office  in  March  1990,  President  Collor  sought  a 
quick  rapprochement  with  the  United  States  in  order  to  begin 
an  aggressive  policy  of  inserting  Brazil  into  the  world  economy 
and  placing  it  at  the  negotiating  table  of  world  powers.  Collor 
concluded  a  nonproliferation  agreement  with  Argentina, 
which  was  registered  with  the  International  Atomic  Energy 
Agency  in  Vienna.  He  moved  to  deactivate  Brazil's  autonomous 
nuclear  project  and  the  nuclear  submarine  project,  as  well  as 
the  air-to-air  Piranha  missile  project.  He  also  gained  congres- 
sional approval  for  eliminating  the  market  reserve  on  com- 
puter products  and  beginning  tariff  reductions.  Collor 
abolished  the  National  Intelligence  Service  (Servico  Nacional 
de  Informacoes — SNI)  and  the  National  Security  Council 
(CSN),  and  fashioned  a  Strategic  Affairs  Secretariat  (Secretaria 
de  Assuntos  Estrategicos — SAE)  with  a  civilian  head.  However, 
after  a  year  in  office  the  Collor  government  concluded  that 
these  overtures  had  been  in  vain.  Reciprocity  by  the  United 
States  was  not  forthcoming,  and  Brazilian  policies  reverted  to  a 
more  pragmatic,  independent  approach. 

The  Franco  administration  maintained  an  even  more  inde- 
pendent stance  and  reacted  coolly  to  proposals  by  the  Clinton 
administration  for  a  Latin  American  free-trade  zone.  Brazil 
pushed  ahead  with  its  Satellite  Launch  Vehicle  (Veiculo  Lanca- 
dor  de  Satelite — VLS)  program,  based  in  Alcantara,  Maranhao. 
Because  Brazil  wants  to  participate  in  the  very  lucrative  satellite 
launching  market,  it  had  consistently  refused,  until  October 
1995,  to  sign  the  MTCR  (Missile  Technology  Control  Regime), 
which  it  believed  restricted  developing  nations  from  attaining 
access  to  this  technology.  In  June  1995,  the  Israeli  military 
attache  in  Brasilia  denounced  Brazil  for  continuing  sales  of 
Astros  II  surface-to-surface  missile  launchers  and  heavy  bombs 
to  Libya,  despite  UN  embargoes.  In  October  1995,  after  contin- 


329 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 


uous  pressure  from  the  United  States,  Brazil  finally  met  the 
conditions  to  join  the  MTCR  and  was  accepted  as  a  member. 
Brazil  joined  the  MTCR  because  it  was  necessary  to  gain  access 
to  crucial  rocket  technology  to  finalize  the  VLS  IV  and  to 
ensure  that  it  would  become  operational  in  1997. 

Relations  with  the  Cardoso  government  in  1995-97  were 
good.  Cardoso  made  a  very  successful  trip  to  Washington  and 
New  York  in  April  1995,  and  the  Clinton  administration  was 
very  enthusiastic  regarding  the  passage  of  constitutional 
amendments  that  open  the  Brazilian  economy  to  increased 
international  participation.  The  United  States  was  especially 
pleased  with  the  break-up  of  state  monopolies  in  the  petro- 
leum and  telecommunications  sectors.  However,  the  United 
States  called  for  increased  efforts  to  stem  international  drug 
smuggling  across  Brazil's  territory  from  Andean  neighbors, 
and  better  coordination  between  the  United  States  Drug 
Enforcement  Administration  (DEA)  and  Brazilian  authorities. 
In  April  1995,  Brasilia  and  Washington  signed  a  new  coopera- 
tion agreement. 

Related  to  the  problem  of  surveillance  of  drug  smuggling 
across  the  Amazon  region  was  the  controversial  Amazon 
Region  Surveillance  System  (Sistema  de  Vigilancia  da 
Amazonia — Sivam)  contract.  In  the  1970s  and  1980s,  Brazil 
had  installed  three  air  surveillance  and  traffic  control  systems 
in  the  South  (Sul),  Southeast,  and  Northeast,  purchased  from 
Thomson  CSF,  the  French  electronics  manufacturer.  In  the 
1990s,  several  international  consortiums,  including  Thomson 
CSF,  hotly  contested  the  proposed  Sivam  contract  (worth 
US$1.5  billion).  A  timely  visit  by  United  States  Secretary  of 
Commerce  Ron  Brown  in  June  1994  heavily  influenced  the 
decision,  and  two  days  after  his  departure,  the  Brazilian  gov- 
ernment decided  in  favor  of  a  consortium  led  by  the  American 
firm  Raytheon,  instead  of  Thomson  CSF.  United  States  incen- 
tives included  very  favorable  Export-Import  Bank  financing 
and  assurance  that  Raytheon  would  participate  in  the  privatiza- 
tion of  the  Brazilian  Aeronautics  Company  (Empresa  Brasileira 
Aeronautica — Embraer),  which  never  happened. 

In  1995,  before  the  final  signing  of  the  contracts  with  Ray- 
theon, Brazil's  Congress,  under  pressure  from  environmental 
groups  and  the  governors  of  the  Amazon  region,  decided  to 
review  the  decision  process  and  contract  details.  Under  intense 
pressure  from  the  United  States  Embassy  in  Brasilia,  however, 
the  Brazilian  Senate  and  Chamber  of  Deputies  finally  approved 


330 


Government  and  Politics 


the  plan  in  May  1995,  over  protests  from  the  governors  from 
the  Amazon  region. 

In  response  to  United  States  criticism  over  its  unfair  trade 
practices  and  its  failure  to  protect  intellectual  property  rights, 
Brazil  finally  signed  a  new  patent  protection  law  in  March  1996. 
The  new  law  includes  protection  for  pharmaceutical  patents 
and  contains  a  "pipeline"  mechanism.  The  United  States  also 
looks  to  Brazil  to  fulfill  its  longstanding  commitments  to  enact 
legislation  on  computer  software  and  semiconductor  layout 
design,  and  to  introduce  amendments  to  its  copyright  laws.

The  best  general  treatments  of  the  Brazilian  political  scene 
are  Ben  Ross  Schneider's  Politics  Within  the  State:  Elite  Bureau- 
crats and  Industrial  Policy  in  Authoritarian  Brazil,  Robert  Wesson

Politics  in  Brazil  and  The  Politics  of  Military  Rule  in  Brazil 

Good  descriptive  works  on  the  structure  of  the  Brazilian 
government  are  not  available.  For  a  specific  treatment  of  Con- 
gress, see  Abdo  I.  Baaklini's  The  Brazilian  Legislature  and  the 
Political  System.  There  are  few  adequate  treatments  of  state  and 
local  governments.  There  is  also  a  dearth  of  publications  on 
the  process  of  the  political  opening  (abertura)  and  transition  in 
Brazil.  Keith  S.  Rosenn's  Whither  Brazil:  The  Consolidation  of 
Democracy  in  Brazil  after  the  Impeachment  of  President  Collor  is  a  col- 
lection of  papers  on  the  Collor  period.  The  only  publication  to 
record  Itamar  Franco's  presidency  was  written  by  his  stalwart 
adviser,  Ferreira  de  Castro,  and  is  entitled  Itamar:  0  homen  que 
redescobriu  o  Brasil  Although  the  influence  of  media  on  politics 
is  extremely  important  in  Brazil,  few  thorough  analyses  exist. 
Fernando  Morais's  Chato,  o  rei  do  Brasil  describes  the  empire 
built  by  Assis  Chateaubriand  in  the  1940s  and  1950s. 

Helgio  Trindade  edited  a  very  good  collection  of  papers  on 
election  reform  in  the  1990s,  entitled  Reforma  eleitoral  e  represen- 
tacao  politica  no  Brasil  dos  anos  90.  There  has  been  considerable 
scholarship  published  on  Brazilian  political  parties.  Fleischer 
edited  two  volumes  of  studies  on  the  1945-79  period,  entitled

Challenges  of  the  1990s  and  Jairo  Marconi  Nicolau's  Multiparti- 
darismo  e  democracia  are  more  recent  analyses. 

There  is  considerable  scholarship  on  Brazil's  international 
relations.  In  his  memoirs,  A  lanterna  na  pdpa,  former  Ambassa- 
dor Roberto  Campos  provides  an  overview  since  Bretton 
Woods.  Mercosul  has  a  growing  bibliography,  most  notable  of 
which  is  a  compilation  by  the  new  Brazilian  Council  of  Interna- 
tional Affairs  (Conselho  Brasileiro  de  Relacoes  Internacio- 
nais),  entitled  Mercosul.  Other  useful  works  on  Mercosul 
include  Luiz  Alberto  Moniz  Bandeira's  Estado  nacional  e  politica 
internacional  na  America  Latina,  and  Rubens  Barbosa's  America 
Latina  em  perspectiva.  Rubens  Ricupero's  Visoes  do  Brasil:  Ensaios 
sobre  a  historia  e  a  insercao  internacional  do  Brasil  is  an  excellent 
account  by  one  of  Brazil's  most  distinguished  diplomats. 
Finally,  Brazil-United  States  relations  have  received  consider- 
able attention.  Frank  D.  McCann's  The  Brazilian-American  Alli- 
ance gives  an  overview  from  the  early  1900s.  W.  Michael  Weis's

BRAZIL'S  ARMED  FORCES  (Forcas  Armadas)  have  played  an 
active  political  role  ever  since  they  helped  overthrow  the 
empire  in  1889.  From  1930  until  1964,  they  asserted  their  mod- 
erating power  (poder  moderador — see  Glossary)  and  intervened 
frequently  in  the  political  process.  In  1964  the  military  ousted 
the  civilian  president  and  governed  for  twenty-one  years. 

A  national  security  doctrine,  with  two  major  elements, 
guided  the  military  regime.  The  first  element  was  a  broad  defi- 
nition of  security  that  included  not  only  defense  against  exter- 
nal aggression  but  also  internal  defense  against  insurgency  and 
communism.  By  using  repressive  measures,  the  military  coun- 
tered domestic  insurgencies  successfully  from  1967  through 
1973.  The  second  element  was  economic  development.  Under 
the  military,  the  role  of  the  state  in  the  economy  grew  consider- 
ably with  the  expansion  of  Brazil's  industrial  base.  High  eco- 
nomic growth  rates  of  the  1968-73  period  helped  to  legitimize 
military  government. 

The  armed  forces  returned  to  the  barracks  in  March  1985. 
Although  they  have  continued  to  assert  themselves  politically, 
their  political  influence  has  been  reduced  substantially  because 
of  several  factors.  First,  as  Brazil  has  sought  to  consolidate  its 
democracy,  the  National  Congress  (Congresso  Nacional;  here- 
after, Congress)  and  civilian  ministries  have  become  more 
involved  and  influential  in  broadly  defined  security  issues.  Sec- 
ond, the  military  was  forced  to  compete  with  civilian  ministries 
for  extremely  limited  resources  and  was  unable  to  halt  a  contin- 
ual decline  in  its  share  of  government  expenditures.  And  third, 
although  the  1988  constitution  preserves  the  external  and 
internal  roles  of  the  armed  forces,  it  places  the  military  under 
presidential  authority.  Thus,  the  new  charter  changed  the  man- 
ner in  which  the  military  could  exercise  its  moderating  power 
(see  The  Military  Mission  since  1988,  this  ch.). 

Furthermore,  the  armed  forces  were  unable  to  promote  and 
fund  pet  projects  effectively  in  the  nuclear,  space,  missile,  and 
armament  arenas.  President  Fernando  Collor  de  Mello  (1990- 
92)  exposed  Brazil's  secret,  military-sponsored  nuclear  bomb 
program,  the  so-called  Parallel  Program  (Programa  Paralelo). 
As  a  result,  several  of  Brazil's  nuclear  programs  were  placed 
under  international  monitoring.  Collor  also  placed  the  Brazil- 
ian space  program  controlled  by  the  Brazilian  Air  Force  (Forca 


335 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Aerea  Brasileira — FAB)  under  civilian  oversight.  In  addition, 
the  Brazilian  government  announced  in  early  1994  that  Brazil 
would  seek  to  join  the  Missile  Technology  Control  Regime  (see 
Glossary),  and  succeeded  in  doing  so  in  October  1995.  Brazil's 
armaments  industry,  supported  by  the  military  regime,  col- 
lapsed without  any  major  intervention  by  the  state  to  shore  it 

up- 
Geopolitical  changes  and  a  shifting  civil-military  balance 

within  Brazil  recast  the  country's  security  interests.  One  geopo- 
litical change  in  the  early  1990s  included  a  transformation 
from  bipolarity  toward  multipolarity  in  the  international  sys- 
tem. Another  change  involved  greater  integration  between  Bra- 
zil and  Argentina.  Political  and  economic  uncertainties  in  1995 
also  influenced  the  Brazilian  military's  perceptions  of  the 
country's  national  security. 

Since  the  1950s,  Brazil's  rate  of  military  expenditures  has 
been  among  the  lowest  in  the  world.  In  1993  this  figure 
dropped  to  only  1.1  percent  of  the  gross  national  product 
(GNP — see  Glossary).  This  trend  reflects  the  low  level  of  exter- 
nal threat.  Brazil  is  by  far  the  largest  country  in  Latin  America 
and  enjoys  generally  good  relations  with  its  ten  South  Ameri- 
can neighbors.  There  is  no  threat  to  Brazil's  internal  security  in 
the  narrow  sense  of  insurgencies.  The  politically  inspired  ter- 
rorism of  the  late  1960s  and  1970s  is  nonexistent. 

Despite  the  low  level  of  defense  expenditures,  Brazil's  armed 
forces  are  the  largest  in  Latin  America,  with  314,000  active-duty 
troops  and  officers  in  1997,  including  132,000  conscripts.  The 
Brazilian  Army  (Exercito  Brasileiro),  the  largest  service 
(accounting  for  66  percent  of  the  total  armed  forces),  has 
200,000  active-duty  troops  and  officers.  The  Brazilian  Navy 
(Marinha  do  Brasil),  totals  64,700  members,  and  the  Brazilian 
Air  Force  (FAB),  50,000. 

With  no  serious  external  or  internal  threats,  the  armed 
forces  are  searching  for  a  new  role.  They  are  expanding  their 
presence  in  the  Amazon  under  the  Northern  Corridor  (Calha 
Norte)  program  (see  The  Military  in  the  Amazon,  this  ch.).  In 
1994  Brazilian  troops  joined  United  Nations  (UN)  peacekeep- 
ing forces  in  five  countries.  The  Brazilian  military,  especially 
the  army,  has  become  more  involved  in  civic-action  programs, 
education,  health  care,  and  constructing  roads,  bridges,  and 
railroads  across  the  nation. 

Debate  in  Brazil  concerning  national  security  policy  has 
been  practically  nonexistent.  Political  dialogue  is  limited  to  dis- 


336 


National  Security 


cussion  of  the  revisions  of  the  constitution,  where  only  modest 
changes  in  the  role  of  the  armed  forces  are  expected.  None  of 
the  political  parties,  except  the  Workers'  Party  (Partido  dos 
Trabalhadores — PT),  has  articulated  a  position  on  defense 
matters.  Although  some  civilians  are  experts  in  defense  mat- 
ters, their  influence  is  negligible.  There  is  no  tradition  of  con- 
gressional oversight  of  the  military,  and  the  defense-related 
bureaucracy  remains  minuscule.  Civil  society  continues  to  show 
a  complete  lack  of  interest  in  issues  related  to  defense.  The 
modest  attempts  by  the  armed  forces  to  reevaluate  their  role, 
structure,  doctrine,  strategy,  and  tactics  are  conducted  in  a  vac- 
uum. Some  analysts  believe  that  the  creation  of  a  ministry  of 
defense  is  a  necessary  condition  for  establishing  civilian  con- 
trol of  the  military. 

The  Military  Role  in  Society  and  Government 
Early  History 

Throughout  the  colonial  era,  the  Portuguese  used  military 
forces  to  defend  their  vast  claims  in  South  America.  The  typical 
practice  was  to  depend  on  local  fighters  and  on  expeditionary 
forces  sent  to  deal  with  particular  crises.  Such  forces  usually 
were  led  by  nobles  and  large  landowners  who  recruited,  often 
forcibly,  unemployed  men  for  the  ranks.  In  addition,  the  Portu- 
guese long  made  use  of  mercenaries  from  various  nationalities, 
a  practice  that  would  continue  into  the  early  nineteenth  cen- 
tury. Colonial  warfare  against  the  French,  and  especially  the 
Dutch  (1624-54),  the  continuous  wars  and  slave-raiding  expe- 
ditions against  the  native  peoples,  and  the  famous  bandeirante 
(see  Glossary)  expeditions  produced  a  vibrant  body  of  military 
traditions.  However,  the  colonial  era  did  not  produce  an  insti- 
tutionalized standing  military  force. 

Thanks  to  the  reforms  of  Marques  de  Pombal,  Portugal's 
emperor,  in  the  mid-eighteenth  century,  more  Brazilian-born 
men  were  drawn  into  colonial  administration — more  so  than 
was  the  case  in  either  the  Spanish  or  the  British  colonies — 
including  military  affairs.  Portugal  did  not  have  a  navy  or  a 
large  permanent  army,  so  it  had  to  depend  on  Brazilians  to 
defend  their  lands.  It  was  only  after  1764  that  regular  royal 
troops  were  posted  in  Brazil,  and  even  their  ranks  had  to  be 
filled  out  with  local  recruits.  By  the  late  eighteenth  century,  the 
officers  of  the  regiments  in  Bahia  were  60  percent  Brazilian- 
born,  but  their  attitudes,  interests,  and  values  were  identical 


337

with  the  rest  of  the  colonial  elites;  they  were  part  of  the  Portu- 
guese empire,  not  officers  in  a  budding  Brazilian  army.  Their 
identification  was  more  with  their  local  region  or  the  greater 
Portuguese  empire  than  with  what  is  now  Brazil. 

The  colonial  units  were  segregated  by  color.  Militia  units 
called  Henriques  (see  Glossary)  were  composed  of  free  blacks, 
while  those  of  mixed  African-European  ancestry,  called  pardos, 
had  their  own  organizations  and  officers.  Local  bosses,  then 
called  mestres  de  campo  (country  masters),  and  later  known  as 
coronets  (colonels — see  Glossary),  organized  the  white  elite  and 
their  hangers-on  into  urban  and  rural  militia  units.  In  the 
countryside,  such  units  were  really  private  armies  that  rein- 
forced the  power  of  the  local  elites.  With  royal  authority 
behind  them,  the  mestres  and  coronets  chased  criminals  and  run- 
away slaves,  kept  track  of  who  passed  through  their  territories 
and  how  much  their  neighbors  produced,  and  meted  out  jus- 
tice as  they  saw  fit.  The  viceroy  was  too  far  away  to  interfere 
with  abuses. 

Lieutenant  Colonel  Henrique  Oscar  Wiederspahn,  in  his 
study  of  Brazil's  war  with  the  United  Provinces  of  the  Rio  de  la 
Plata  (1825-28)  over  what  is  now  Uruguay,  observed  that  "the 
Brazilian  Armed  Forces  have  their  origins  in  those  [forces]  that 
Dom  Joao  VI  left  us  on  returning  with  his  Court  to  Lisbon.  ..." 
Dom  Pedro  I  (emperor,  1822-31)  used  the  army  and  navy  to 
expel  the  Portuguese  forces  that  remained  loyal  to  the  govern- 
ment in  Lisbon  after  September  1822.  In  the  campaigns  of  the 
1820s  to  expel  the  Portuguese  from  Rio  de  Janeiro,  Salvador, 
and  Maranhao,  the  role  played  by  foreign  mercenaries,  such  as 
British  Admiral  Thomas  Alexander  Cochrane  (Lord  Dun- 
donald)  and  Frenchman  General  Pierre  Labatut,  was  pivotal  in 
achieving  victory.  However,  the  political  disputes  of  that  decade 
placed  the  new  emperor  at  odds  with  the  regional  elites.  Their 
suspicion  of  the  new  imperial  army  (in  1828  it  included  a  few 
thousand  Irish  and  Germans  recruited  abroad)  and  of  the  Por- 
tuguese-born emperor  and  his  Portuguese  generals  led  to  his 
abdication  in  1831  and  to  the  formation  of  the  National  Guard 
as  a  counterpoise  to  the  army. 

The  army  barely  survived  the  1830s  and  had  to  contend  with 
the  National  Guard  as  a  potential  rival  until  early  in  the  next 
century.  What  institutionalized  the  army  were  the  fierce  cam- 
paigns under  the  leadership  of  Luis  Alves  de  Lima  e  Silva  (later 
the  famous  Duke  of  Caxias  (Duque  de  Caxias))  that  crushed 
regional  revolts  (see  The  Regency  Era,  1831-40,  ch.  1)  in  the

1830s  and  1840s.  Army  organization  was  improved  in  the  cam- 
paign against  Argentine  president  Juan  Manuel  de  Rosas  in  the 
upper  Rio  de  la  Plata  in  1852  and  institutionalized  as  a  result  of 
the  War  of  the  Triple  Alliance  (1864-70)  against  Paraguay. 
That  war  provided  the  army's  principal  battle  experience  and 
heroes  and  fixed  its  main  locus  of  operations  on  the  South 
(Sul)  for  decades  to  come. 

Brazil's  involvement  in  the  Paraguayan  War  proved  to  be  a 
watershed  for  the  army  and  navy.  Brazil  joined  Argentina  and 
the  Uruguayan  Colorados  (members  of  the  Colorado  Party) 
and  successfully  resisted  the  expansionism  of  Paraguayan  dicta- 
tor Francisco  Solano  Lopez.  In  March  1870,  Solano  Lopez  was 
defeated  decisively.  Although  the  number  of  Paraguayan  casu- 
alties remains  a  topic  of  debate  among  historians,  a  majority  of 
the  Paraguayan  adult  male  population  supposedly  was  killed. 
The  Paraguayan  War  rapidly  expanded  the  size  of  Brazil's  army. 
In  1864,  prior  to  the  war,  Brazil  had  17,000  soldiers  in  the 
army;  by  the  end  of  the  war,  there  were  100,000. 

On  returning  to  Brazil,  many  of  the  officers  were  restless 
with  the  deficiencies  in  their  economy,  such  as  the  lack  of  an 


339 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

industry  to  supply  the  army  adequately.  Their  leader,  the 
Duque  de  Caxias,  was  loyal  to  Pedro  II  (emperor,  1840-89)  and 
kept  anti-imperialist  sentiments  under  control,  but  after  he 
died  in  1880  officers  became  more  active  in  the  political  arena. 
Although  they  were  barred  legally  from  debating  government 
policies  publicly,  some  military  officers  expressed  dissatisfac- 
tion openly.  For  example,  they  resented  their  role  in  capturing 
runaway  slaves.  In  1879  officers  reacted  strongly  to  a  bill  that 
would  reduce  the  size  of  the  military.  In  1883  they  vehemently 
opposed  compulsory  payments  to  an  insurance  fund.  In  1887 
they  founded  Rio  de  Janeiro's  Military  Club  (Clube  Militar)  to 
express  their  grievances.  The  Military  Club  provided  a  forum 
for  open  debate  and  criticism  of  government  policies. 

Field  Marshal  Manuel  Deodoro  da  Fonseca,  the  first  presi- 
dent of  the  Military  Club,  emerged  as  a  vocal  proponent  of  mil- 
itary interests.  On  November  9,  1889,  Benjamin  Constant,  a 
leading  advocate  of  positivism  (see  Glossary),  spoke  at  the  Mili- 
tary Club  and  called  for  "full  powers  to  free  the  military  from  a 
state  of  affairs  incompatible  with  its  honor  and  its  dignity."  Less 
than  a  week  later,  on  November  15,  Deodoro  led  a  bloodless 
coup,  which  ended  the  empire  of  Dom  Pedro  II,  and  ushered 
in  the  Old  Republic  (1889-1930).  On  November  16,  he 
declared  Brazil  a  federal  republic. 

Deodoro  was  the  provisional  leader  of  Brazil  until  February 
25,  1891,  when  Congress  elected  him  president.  He  served  as 
president  until  November  23,  1891.  Under  Deodoro  the  army, 
which  had  decreased  to  13,000  members  in  the  aftermath  of 
the  Paraguayan  War,  increased  its  size  to  20,000.  Army  officers 
governed  half  of  Brazil's  twenty  states  at  the  time.  Cabinet 
members,  however,  were  primarily  civilians  (exceptions 
included  Colonel  Constant,  minister  of  war;  and  Vice  Admiral 
Eduardo  Wandenkolk,  minister  of  navy) . 

Deodoro  promulgated  a  new  constitution  on  February  24, 
1891,  and  a  day  later  was  elected  president  by  Congress  under 
that  charter's  provisions.  Indicating  their  displeasure  with  what 
they  perceived  to  be  a  fraudulent  and  manipulated  constitu- 
tion, Congress  elected  Deodoro's  rival,  Floriano  Peixoto,  to  the 
vice  presidency.  On  November  23,  1891,  Deodoro  resigned 
from  the  presidency  because  of  strong  resistance  to  his  policies 
from  Congress,  some  states,  the  navy,  and  a  faction  of  the  army 
led  by  Peixoto.  Peixoto  assumed  the  presidency  on  the  same 
day,  and  ruled  until  November  15,  1894.  Because  of  his  strong 


340 


National  Security 


personality,  he  was  known  as  the  Iron  Marshal  (Marechal  de 
Ferro). 

Peixoto  was  succeeded  by  Prudente  Jose  de  Morais  e  Barros, 
also  known  as  Prudente  de  Morais,  the  first  civilian  president  of 
Brazil  (1894-98),  and  the  first  elected  by  popular  vote.  Pru- 
dente de  Morais  was  succeeded  by  Manuel  Ferraz  de  Campos 
Sales  (president,  1898-1902).  Prudente  de  Morais  and  Campos 
Sales  were  the  first  of  various  presidents  in  what  has  been 
termed  the  Republic  of  the  Oligarchies  (Republica  das  Oligar- 
quias),  in  which  coffee  growers  in  the  Southeast  (Sudeste) 
effectively  controlled  the  presidency. 

As  presidents,  Deodoro  and  Peixoto  provided  for  the  transi- 
tion from  empire  to  republic.  In  a  matter  of  five  years,  the  Bra- 
zilian presidency  was  turned  over  to  a  directly  elected  civilian. 
The  governments  between  1894  and  1930  were  inherently  con- 
servative, but  this  was  Brazil's  first  experiment  with  democracy. 

Military  Rebellion  and  the  Revolution  of  1930 

Military  planners  in  the  late  1920s  characterized  the  army  as 
the  central  agent  of  Brazilian  national  unity  and  greatness. 
They  believed  that  economic  development,  military  prepared- 
ness, and  national  power  were  linked  tightly.  The  national  ter- 
ritory held  immeasurable  resources  that  had  to  be  protected 
from  covetous  foreigners  until  Brazilians  could  exploit  them. 
They  pointed  to  Japan  and  Argentina  as  examples  of  countries 
building  military  and  economic  power  simultaneously.  Reform- 
ist officers  (called  "Young  Turks"  after  the  military  reformers  of 
Turkey)  thought  that  the  lack  of  national  cohesion  was  a  far 
greater  threat  to  Brazil  than  was  any  foreign  threat.  The  army, 
in  their  view,  was  the  only  instrument  to  hold  the  country 
together  by  being  a  school  of  citizenship,  and  by  teaching  the 
superiority  of  the  collective  over  individual  good  in  sacrifice  for 
the  motherland.  Meanwhile,  Brazilians  of  all  classes  fled  from 
military  service,  and  draft  dodging  was  chronic. 

Even  so,  obligatory  military  service  resulted  in  the  physical 
expansion  of  the  army,  which  eventually  gave  it  the  ability  to 
intervene  in  politics  and  in  society  more  profoundly  than  in 
the  past.  To  give  the  army  a  local  image  while  eliminating  the 
expense  and  supervisory  burden  of  transporting  draftees  to 
distant  training  camps,  garrisons  were  established  in  every  state 
to  train  them.  The  new  system  also  required  expanding  the 
number  of  personnel  in  the  army  (18,000  to  25,000  in  1916- 
17,  30,000  in  1920,  48,000  in  1930,  93,000  in  1940);  indeed, 


341 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

during  the  Old  Republic,  it  grew  52  percent  faster  than  did  the 
rapidly  growing  population. 

In  the  1920s,  an  intense  struggle  for  control  of  the  army  was 
in  part  motivated  by  conflicting  ideas  of  what  the  institution's 
role  was  to  be  in  the  increasingly  consolidated  Brazilian  nation- 
state.  The  German-trained  Young  Turks  sought  modernization. 
After  1919  the  French  Military  Mission  also  encouraged  profes- 
sionalization  and  enhancement  of  the  army's  self-image  as  the 
central  institution  of  the  Brazilian  state.  By  1929  the  state  had 
intensified  its  centralizing  powers  by  expanding  federal  owner- 
ship of  the  country's  railroads,  shipping  lines,  ports,  and  banks. 
In  the  coffee-dominated  economy,  the  federal  government 
controlled  coffee  marketing  and  sought  to  influence  world  cof- 
fee prices.  However,  some  officers  were  troubled  by  who  was 
running  the  state  and  army  during  the  presidencies  of  Vences- 
lau  Bras  Pereira  Gomes  (1914-18),  Delphim  Moreira  da  Costa 
Ribeiro  (acting,  1918-19),  and  Epitacio  da  Silva  Pessoa  (1919- 
22). 

The  lieutenants'  rebellions  (tenentismo — see  Glossary)  of  the 
1920s  were  complicated  in  that  they  involved  a  minority  of 
officers  who  were  as  much  in  revolt  against  the  army  hierarchy 
as  against  the  central  government.  There  was  to  be  no  amnesty, 
and  so  faced  with  either  giving  up  their  careers  or  continuing 
to  conspire,  the  tenentes  chose  the  latter.  The  result  was  the 
1924  uprising  in  Sao  Paulo  and  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  which  led 
to  the  retreat  of  the  tenentes  into  the  interior  and  the  long  cam- 
paign of  the  Prestes  Column,  named  after  the  romantic  revolu- 
tionary Luis  Carlos  Prestes,  across  Brazil  until  it  gave  up  and 
entered  Bolivia  in  1927.  In  that  decade,  many  of  the  best  of  the 
officer  corps  became  rebels  to  save  their  careers  and  to  save  the 
army  from  corrupt  officers.  Thus,  during  the  1920s,  the  army 
institution  played  a  conservative  role,  while  a  determined,  tal- 
ented minority  of  its  officer  corps  pursued  revolution. 

In  the  revolts  of  1930,  the  tenentes  joined  with  disgruntled 
former  officers  and  anti-Paulista  politicians  who  felt  that  their 
regional  interests  were  suffering  unduly  from  the  Sao  Paulo- 
centered  national  state.  For  the  tenentes,  joining  the  Liberation 
Alliance  (Alianca  Libertadora)  was  a  compromise  of  their  ide- 
als because  they  were  locking  arms  with  the  very  politicians 
against  whom  they  had  rebelled — former  presidents  Pessoa 
and  Artur  da  Silva  Bernardes  (1922-26).  This  course  of  action 
was  necessary,  however,  if  the  tenentes  hoped  to  win.  The  alli- 
ance also  included  their  old  civilian  allies:  the  gaucho  "libera-

tors,"  Paulista  democrats,  and  Federal  District  (Distrito 
Federal)  opposition  politicians. 

In  the  past,  the  tenentes  had  always  sought  the  support  of 
higher  ranking  officers.  In  1930  they  failed  to  get  any  generals 
to  join  them,  so  they  settled  for  an  up-and-coming  lieutenant 
colonel,  Pedro  de  Goes  Monteiro,  who  had  fought  against 
them.  In  the  next  decade,  he  would  reshape  the  army.  For  its 
part,  the  Liberal  Alliance,  led  by  Getulio  Dorneles  Vargas,  gov- 
ernor of  Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  embraced  tenente  demands — such 
as  the  secret  ballot,  better  election  laws,  treatment  of  social 
problems,  and  especially  amnesty.  In  this  way,  the  tenentes 
became  one  of  the  strong  arms  of  the  dissident  oligarchies  of 
Rio  Grande  do  Sul,  Minas  Gerais,  Sao  Paulo,  and  Paraiba. 

The  revolutionaries  were  successful  in  1930  largely  because 
the  army  lost  its  will  to  defend  the  regime.  The  command 
structure  in  effect  imploded,  and  the  rebels  quickly  gained 
control  of  fifteen  of  the  twenty  states.  The  senior  generals  in 
Rio  de  Janeiro  realized  that  the  government  was  finished,  and 
that  they  would  be  too  if  they  did  not  at  least  keep  hold  of  what 


343 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

remained  of  the  army  in  the  capital.  Also,  they  were  nervous 
that  the  police  would  lose  control  of  the  streets,  so  they  took 
President  Washington  Luis  Pereira  de  Sousa  (1926-30)  into 
custody.  Many  texts  speak  incorrectly  of  the  army  staging  a 
coup  and  turning  the  government  over  to  Getulio  Vargas.  In 
fact,  the  generals  were  looking  at  defeat  and  acted  to  gain  some 
say  in  the  future. 

Nonetheless,  the  senior  ranks  were  thinned  by  a  massive 
purge.  By  the  end  of  1930,  nine  of  the  eleven  major  generals 
and  eleven  of  the  twenty-four  brigadier  generals  were  retired, 
and  in  1931  twelve  of  the  twenty  brigadier  generals,  many  of 
whom  had  been  promoted  recently,  also  were  retired.  The  rev- 
olution of  1930  opened  a  decade  of  reform  that  made  the  army 
even  more  an  instrument  of  the  central  government  and  its 
civilian  leaders. 

From  Moderator  to  Director,  1930-85 

There  is  a  debate  over  whether  the  military  appropriated  the 
moderating  power  during  the  Old  Republic  (1889-1930). 
Many  historians  emphasize  the  moderating  role  as  early  as 
1889,  with  the  argument  that  the  army  claimed  the  emperor's 
moderating  power,  which  had  allowed  him  to  intervene  in  and 
resolve  political  conflicts.  Some  argue  that  the  military  did  not 
assume  a  moderating  role  until  after  1930,  primarily  during  the 
1937-45  period  of  the  quasi-fascist  New  State  (Estado  Novo)  of 
Getulio  Vargas  (president,  1930-45,  1951-54).  According  to 
the  revisionist  view,  the  army  in  1889  did  not  intend  to  play  a 
moderating  role.  However,  after  the  collapse  of  the  army  in 
1930  and  its  subsequent  rebuilding,  the  military  accepted  the 
ideology  of  the  poder  moderador.  The  debate  is  important 
because  the  revisionist  view  suggests  a  more  grudging  accep- 
tance by  the  military  of  the  moderating  role. 

According  to  political  scientist  Alfred  C.  Stepan,  the  military 
played  a  moderating  role  in  civil-military  relations  during  the 
coups  of  1930,  1945,  1954,  and  1964;  during  the  abortive  inter- 
vention of  1961;  and  in  1953,  when  the  minister  of  war,  Gen- 
eral Henrique  Teixeira  Lott,  guaranteed  President  Juscelino 
Kubitschek's  inauguration  as  the  democratically  elected  presi- 
dent (1956-61)  on  January  31,  1956.  The  pro-Kubitschek  fac- 
tion within  the  military  was  actually  the  largest  and  most 
influential.  The  military  viewed  itself  as  "the  people  in  uni- 
form" (o  povo  fardado),  inextricably  a  part  of  the  political  sys- 


344 


National  Security 


tern.  Civilians,  in  turn,  generally  accepted  the  military's 
moderating  function  as  legitimate. 

In  the  1930  coup,  military  officers  of  a  reformist  bent  sup- 
ported Vargas  after  he  declared  the  previous  elections  fraudu- 
lent and  assumed  the  presidency.  As  the  army  reorganized 
itself,  discipline  was  shaky.  During  the  decade,  there  were  six- 
teen barracks  revolts  and  seventy-two  other  instances  of  agita- 
tion, conspiracy,  and  protest.  Between  1931  and  1938,  at  least 
624  officers  and  1,875  soldiers  were  expelled  from  the  army. 
Thus,  one  of  the  principal  reasons  for  General  Goes  Monteiro 
and  General  Eurico  Gaspar  Dutra's  support  of  the  dictatorial 
Estado  Novo  in  November  1937  was  to  reestablish  control  and 
discipline  in  the  army.  Whereas  the  turmoil  of  the  1890s  had 
ended  in  the  "politics  of  the  governors,"  that  of  the  1930s 
ended  in  the  imposition  of  Brazil's  first  long-lived  authoritarian 
regime  (1937-45). 

Ironically,  the  second  coup  in  1945  was  against  Vargas.  The 
military  moved  to  intervene  a  third  time  in  1954,  again  to 
remove  Vargas  from  office,  an  action  that  led  to  his  suicide.  In 
its  fourth  intervention,  in  1955,  an  anti-Kubitschek  faction  of 
the  military,  defeated  by  the  larger  pro-Kubitschek  military  fac- 
tion led  by  General  Lott,  failed  to  stop  Kubitschek  from  assum- 
ing the  presidency.  In  the  fifth  intervention,  in  1961,  three 
military  ministers  were  unable  to  block  Joao  Goulart  (presi- 
dent, 1961-64)  from  succeeding  Janio  Quadros  (president, 
January-August  1961).  The  sixth  intervention  came  on  March 
31,  1964,  when  the  military  overthrew  left-of-center  Goulart.  By 
that  action,  the  military  shifted  from  the  moderator  model  of 
civil-military  relations  to  direct  military  government. 

The  1964  military  coup  was  clearly  different  from  that  of  the 
previous  five  military  interventions.  For  the  first  time  in  the 
twentieth  century,  the  Brazilian  military  assumed  political 
power.  As  Stepan  has  noted,  the  military  became  the  director 
and  not  the  moderator  of  politics.  Instead  of  maintaining  the 
status  quo,  the  military  sought  to  transform  the  system.  That 
transformation  required  a  new  professionalism  (prqftssionalismo 
novo)  for  the  military,  which  had  no  experience  in  long-term 
governing.  The  major  vehicle  for  that  new  role  was  the  War 
College  (Escola  Superior  de  Guerra — ESG).  Emphasizing 
internal  security  and  national  development,  the  ESG  is  an 
advanced  training  program  for  senior  officers  and  civilians. 

Political  scientist  David  V.  Fleischer,  referring  to  the  security 
and  development  ideology  of  the  military  regime  from  1964  to 


345 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

1985,  points  out  the  continuity  in  the  evolution  of  civil-military 
relations  that  can  be  traced  to  the  nineteenth-century  positiv- 
ism of  the  military  activists  who  founded  the  republic  under 
the  slogan  of  "Order  and  Progress."  This  continuity  extends, 
Fleischer  notes,  through  the  growing  economic  nationalism  in 
the  1930s  and  the  Estado  Novo  to  the  Kubitschek  era.  In  the 
latter  era,  autonomous  development  became  a  priority  to 
ensure  national  security. 

From  1964  to  1985,  the  military  dominated  the  presidency. 
The  army  imposed  its  candidates  for  president  and  governor, 
and  a  docile  Congress  or  an  electoral  college  approved  them. 
These  candidates  included  Humberto  Castelo  Branco  (presi- 
dent, 1964-67),  Artur  da  Costa  e  Silva  (president,  1967-69), 
Emflio  Garrastazu  Medici  (president,  1969-74),  Ernesto  Geisel 
(president,  1974—79),  andjoao  Baptista  de  Oliveira  Figueiredo 
(president,  1979-85).  Both  Medici  and  Figueiredo  were  former 
intelligence  chiefs. 

The  military  based  its  original  plan  of  government  on  a 
moderate  degree  of  civilian  support  and  complete  military 
unity.  With  time,  military  government  exacerbated  factional- 
ism within  the  military.  That  division  centered  on  adherents  to 
and  dissenters  from  the  ESG  ideology.  The  pro-ESG  members 
of  the  military,  the  so-called  Sorbonnists,  were  politically  mod- 
erate and  wanted  to  maintain  democratic  forms  and  institu- 
tions. They  aided  in  returning  the  presidency  to  civilian 
government.  Presidents  Castelo  Branco  and  Geisel  best  repre- 
sented this  faction.  In  contrast,  the  hard-liners  within  the  mili- 
tary favored  suspension  of  democratic  processes  and  were 
more  nationalistic.  They  argued  against  a  high  degree  of  for- 
eign political  and  economic  dependence  in  attaining  the  goals 
of  security  and  development.  The  hard-liners  were  hesitant  to 
return  political  power  to  civilians.  Presidents  Costa  e  Silva  and 
Medici  best  represented  this  faction  within  the  military. 

The  Internal  Security  Mission,  1964-85 

A  central  feature  of  military  government  during  the  1964-85 
period  was  tension  between  external  and  internal  defense 
roles.  After  World  War  II,  an  internal  orientation  became 
respectable  as  a  result  of  the  bipolar  division  of  the  world  into 
Soviet  and  Western  camps,  the  peacekeeping  procedures  of  the 
Organization  of  American  States  (OAS;  see  Glossary),  and  the 
study  programs  of  the  ESG  and  the  Army  General  Staff  School 
(Escola  de  Comando  de  Estado-Maior  do  Exercito — ECEME).

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

In  the  1950s,  the  ESG  expanded  on  the  doctrines  of  the  French 
Military  Mission  (1919-39)  and  the  Joint  Brazil-United  States 
Defense  Commission  (1942-77),  which  emphasized  the  need 
for  officers  to  study  elements  of  the  society  and  economy  that 
contributed  to  socioeconomic  and  political  stability.  The  ESG's 
military-civilian  student  body  studied  inflation,  banking 
reform,  agrarian  reform,  voting  systems,  transportation,  and 
education,  as  well  as  counterinsurgency.  Because  of  the  inter- 
locking of  the  ESG  and  ECEME,  by  the  mid-1960s  the  ESG's 
doctrines  were  mirrored  in  the  ECEME's  and  thus  had  been 
extended  to  the  officer  corps  as  a  whole. 

As  Brazil's  crisis  deepened  in  the  early  1960s,  the  military 
perceived  the  country  as  entering  an  era  of  subversive  warfare. 
Military  officers  had  studied  this  type  of  unconventional  war- 
fare in  ECEME  courses  on  internal  security  and  irregular  war- 
fare. The  ECEME  played  a  key  role  in  convincing  officers  to 
support  the  movement  of  1964.  In  the  months  prior  to  March 
1964,  the  staff  and  student  officers  distributed  newsletters 
throughout  the  army,  arguing  the  necessity  of  intervention. 
They  had  come  to  believe  that  internal  security  and  rational 
economic  development  would  occur  only  if  various  aspects  of 
the  economic  and  political  structure  were  altered.  They  also 
believed  that  the  civilian  leaders  were  unwilling  or  unable  to 
make  the  required  changes. 

For  a  military  organization,  mission  and  identity  are  tightly 
intertwined.  It  can  therefore  be  argued  that  in  seeking  to  clar- 
ify its  mission,  the  Brazilian  military  was  attempting  to  resolve 
its  identity.  Military  analyst  Edmundo  Campos  Coelho  saw  the 
military  in  the  post-World  War  II  era  as  suffering  from  a  severe 
identity  crisis.  In  his  view,  this  crisis  had  its  origin  in  the  identity 
crisis  of  the  Brazilian  state,  which  lacked  a  focal  institution  that 
everyone  could  accept  as  the  "incorporation  of  national 
authority." 

In  1963  and  early  1964,  there  was  widespread  acceptance  in 
the  officer  corps  of  the  need  to  act  against  the  Goulart  govern- 
ment. However,  there  was  less  of  a  consensus  for  maintaining 
military  control  once  a  stable  government  was  established. 
Even  though  the  hard-liners  were  able  to  impose  authoritarian 
rule,  an  underlying  sense  of  malaise  followed.  The  military's 
organizational  structure,  field  training,  and  weapon  systems 
were  geared  for  use  against  conventional  forces  or,  to  a  lesser 
extent,  guerrilla  forces.  Although  the  military  was  not  struc- 
tured to  govern  the  country,  military  institutions  adapted 


348 


National  Security 


themselves  to  their  assignments  after  1964  (and  especially  after 
1968).  Nevertheless,  many  officers  were  ill  at  ease  in  their 
police-like  internal  security  roles,  and  officers  reacted  angrily 
when  names  such  as  milicia  (militia)  were  applied  to  them. 

A  power  struggle  in  late  1965  and  early  1966  led  to  the 
defeat  of  the  Castelo  Branco  faction  at  the  hands  of  the  hard- 
line officers  clustered  around  Minister  of  Army  Arthur  da 
Costa  e  Silva.  It  represented  a  victory  for  those  who  favored 
defining  the  military's  mission  as  primarily  one  of  internal 
security.  In  effect,  this  struggle  may  have  produced  two  com- 
peting ideas  of  military  professionalism:  Stepan's  "new  profes- 
sionalism" of  internal  security  versus  the  other  that  sees  the 
essence  of  the  military  profession  as  one  in  which  troops  are 
trained  and  equipped  to  fight  foreign  conventional  forces  as 
the  essence  of  their  profession.  Some  officers  questioned  the 
legitimacy  of  the  internal  security  activities  of  their  colleagues, 
even  though  they  may  have  acknowledged  the  need  for  such 
activities.  These  officers  regarded  troop  commands  and  nor- 
mal staff  assignments  as  being  more  "military"  than  internal 
security  assignments. 

The  officer  corps  has  split  in  a  variety  of  ways  over  the  years. 
After  the  rise  of  Geisel,  if  not  before,  some  officers  worried  that 
a  high  level  of  political  involvement  was  bad  and  distracted  the 
corps  from  its  main  responsibility  of  protecting  the  country 
against  foreign  enemies.  They  argued  in  favor  of  a  narrow  defi- 
nition of  the  military's  mission,  limiting  it  to  external  defense. 
They  argued  further  that  to  mount  a  secure  external  defense, 
internal  support  and  cohesion  were  necessary.  Officers  could 
not  be  seen  imposing  an  unpopular  government  one  day  and 
appealing  to  the  population's  patriotism  the  next.  Those  who 
had  long  argued  this  way  were  nearly  jubilant  in  pointing  to  the 
disastrous  results  of  the  failed  Argentine  invasion  of  the  Falk- 
land/Malvinas  Islands  in  1982. 

Officers  whose  hands  were  tainted  during  the  Military 
Republic  (1964-85)  were  fearful  of  reprisals  once  civilian  gov- 
ernment returned.  In  August  1979,  Congress  approved 
Figueiredo's  proposal  for  amnesty,  for  both  the  agents  of 
repression  and  those  who  took  up  arms  against  the  regime. 
The  amnesty  facilitated  the  military's  return  to  the  barracks  but 
did  not  resolve  the  moral  or  legal  issues  involved.  With  the 
return  of  full  democracy  in  1985,  the  victims  began  seeking 
redress  in  the  courts,  while  some  officers  with  tarnished  reputa- 
tions were  coming  up  for  promotion  to  general.  Many  active 


349 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

and  retired  officers  who  were  not  involved  directly  in  repres- 
sion or  torture  tended  to  defend  colleagues  who  were.  The 
cleavages  that  the  repression  caused  within  the  military  and 
between  the  military  and  society  have  posed  major  problems 
for  the  army. 

The  hard-liners  usually  are  very  nationalistic  and  argue  for 
stronger  stances  in  foreign  policy,  for  stronger  controls  over 
multinationals,  and  especially  for  stronger  positions  against  the 
United  States  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF — see 
Glossary).  On  October  7,  1987,  a  group  of  retired  hard-line 
generals  and  their  civilian  allies  formed  the  Brazilian  Associa- 
tion for  the  Defense  of  Democracy  (Associacao  Brasileira  de 
Defesa  da  Democracia — ABDD).  The  ABDD  argued  for  a  new 
military  intervention  "if  the  politicians  did  not  turn  back  the 
chaos."  The  ABDD  and  similar  groups,  although  populated  by 
disgruntled  retirees,  have  virtually  no  political  influence. 

The  military  has  an  elaborate  ideology  of  nationalism  and 
development,  much  of  which  has  been  incorporated  into  the 
thinking  of  civilian  opinion  makers  and  politicians.  Essentially, 
this  ideology  holds  that  Brazil  can  be,  and  should  be,  a  great 
power.  The  military  sees  its  primary  function  as  contributing  to 
that  objective. 

Civil-Military  Relations,  1 985-94 

Alfred  C.  Stepan  has  argued  that  although  the  Brazilian  mili- 
tary ceded  power  to  Jose  Sarney  (1985-90)  in  1985,  it  retained 
significant  prerogatives.  President  Sarney  depended  on  the 
armed  forces  because  of  his  weak  political  base.  According  to 
Professor  Fleischer,  Sarney  was  not  well  prepared  to  assume  the 
presidency,  so  General  Ivan  Souza  Mendes,  the  director  of  the 
National  Intelligence  Service  (Servico  Nacional  de  Infor- 
macoes — SNI)  "stepped  in  to  fill  the  void"  and  helped  him 
"organize  his  presidency."  As  a  result  of  his  dependence  on  the 
military,  Sarney' s  administration  made  little  progress  in  gaining 
greater  control  over  the  armed  forces. 

Congress,  meeting  as  a  Constituent  Assembly  (Assembleia 
Constituinte),  redrafted  the  constitution  from  February  1987 
until  October  5,  1988,  when  it  was  promulgated.  The  1988  con- 
stitution strengthened  presidential  control  of  the  military  by 
removing  the  clause  that  stated  the  military  was  only  obedient 
to  the  executive  "within  the  limits  of  the  law."  In  late  1989,  the 
first  direct  presidential  election  was  held  in  almost  three 


350 


National  Security 


decades,  and  in  March  1990  Fernando  Collor  de  Mello  took 
office. 

Under  President  Collor  de  Mello,  the  prerogatives  of  the 
armed  forces  were  reduced  modestly,  but  erratically,  in  a  "two 
steps  forward,  one  step  back"  manner.  Four  examples  of  such 
reductions  can  be  cited.  First,  Collor  de  Mello  replaced  the 
military-dominated  SNI  with  the  civilian-led  Strategic  Affairs 
Secretariat  (Secretaria  de  Assuntos  Estrategicos — SAE).  Sec- 
ond, he  cut  defense  spending  to  the  lowest  level  in  decades: 
approximately  0.3  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP — 
see  Glossary)  in  1993,  down  from  0.9  percent  in  1987.  Third, 
he  attempted  to  establish  more  effective  control  over  Brazil's 
various  nuclear  and  other  strategic  programs.  And  fourth,  the 
government  announced  that  the  Brazilian  Aeronautics  Com- 
pany (Empresa  Brasileira  da  Aeronautica — Embraer),  which 
manufactures  the  Tucano  trainer  and  the  subsonic  AMX 
fighter,  would  be  privatized  (Embraer  was  privatized  in  Decem- 
ber 1994). 

Furthermore,  in  1990  Collor  revealed  publicly  the  secret 
atomic  bomb  project  developed  by  the  army.  On  September  5, 
1991,  Brazil  and  Argentina  agreed  to  establish  the  Brazilian- 
Argentine  Agency  for  Accounting  and  Control  of  Nuclear 
Materials  (Agenda  Brasileiro-Argentina  de  Contabilidade  e 
Controle  de  Materials  Nucleares — ABACC).  This  agreement 
permits  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA)  to 
inspect  nuclear  installations  in  Argentina  and  Brazil.  On  that 
occasion,  Brazil  also  signed,  with  Argentina  and  Chile,  a  treaty 
forbidding  the  development,  manufacture,  and  use  of  chemi- 
cal weapons.  In  December  1991,  Collor  participated  in  the 
signing  of  a  comprehensive  safeguards  agreement  among  Bra- 
zil, Argentina,  and  the  IAEA. 

Collor  created  an  interministerial  group  to  formulate  a 
more  restrictive  arms-control  policy.  He  increased  consultation 
with  the  United  States  on  the  conditions  for  gaining  access  to 
the  technologies  covered  by  the  MTCR  (Missile  Technology 
Control  Regime).  He  also  announced  that  Brazil  would  create 
a  space  agency,  under  civilian  control,  to  open  up  activities  in 
this  sector  and  to  promote  the  commercial  exploitation  of  the 
Alcantara  rocket-launching  base.  That  agency  was  established 
by  his  successor,  Itamar  Franco  (president,  1992-94) . 

Under  Collor  civilian  political  institutions  generally  were 
strengthened.  The  government  granted  the  Ministry  of  For- 
eign Affairs  (Itamaraty)  even  greater  autonomy  on  foreign  pol- 


351

icy  issues,  including  some  defense-related  issues.  Congress 
played  a  more  assertive  role,  and  in  late  1990  conducted  a 
major  investigation  into  Brazil's  nuclear  program.  The  investi- 
gation, conducted  by  a  Congressional  Investigating  Committee 
(Comissao  Parlamentar  de  Inquerito — CPI),  was  extensive  and 
included  the  testimony  of  former  President  Joao  Figueiredo 
(1979-85). 

Collor's  political  isolation  after  his  first  year  as  president  led 
him  to  curry  the  support  of  the  military.  For  example,  Collor 
restored  funding  for  Embraer's  subsonic  AMX  fighter  in 
mid-1991  after  denying  funding  in  1990.  In  addition,  the  army 
announced  that  it  would  not  allow  a  foreign  firm  to  buy  the 
nearly  bankrupt  Specialized  Engineers,  Inc.  (Engenheiros 
Especializados  S.A. — Engesa).  Instead,  Engesa,  which  had  a 
debt  of  more  than  US$400  million  and  showed  little  hope  for 
profitability,  would  be  turned  into  a  state-controlled  enterprise. 

President  Franco  established  closer  ties  with  the  military.  He 
named  various  retired  officers  to  sensitive  posts  within  the  cabi- 
net. On  several  occasions,  he  acquiesced  to  military  requests 
for  higher  salaries.  The  government's  relations  with  the  mili- 
tary improved  further  after  Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso 
became  president  on  January  1,  1995. 

Brazil  and  International  Conflicts,  1917-95 

Brazil's  involvement  in  World  War  I  did  not  include  sending 
troops  to  Europe.  In  the  early  years  of  the  war,  the  Brazilian 
authorities  sought  to  maintain  strict  neutrality,  and  full  diplo- 
matic relations  were  continued  with  the  Central  (Axis)  Powers. 
Pro-Allied  sentiment  was  strong  among  the  Brazilians,  however, 
and  by  1917,  when  German  U-boats  began  torpedoing  Brazil- 
ian freighters,  Brazil  broke  diplomatic  relations  with  and 
declared  war  against  the  Central  Powers.  Participation  in  the 
war  was  limited  largely  to  naval  patrols  in  the  South  Atlantic.  As 
a  belligerent,  Brazil  was  represented  at  the  Versailles  peace 
conference,  thereby  securing  a  measure  of  prestige,  as  well  as  a 
share  of  German  reparations.  This  led  to  Brazilian  member- 
ship in  the  League  of  Nations  (see  Glossary). 

At  the  outbreak  of  World  War  II,  Brazil  was  again  quick  to 
announce  its  neutrality,  and  the  Vargas  government  avoided 
any  action  that  seemed  to  favor  either  side.  The  army's  numeri- 
cal growth,  from  a  1930  level  of  47,997  to  a  1940  level  of 
93,000,  and  its  acquisition  of  modern  weapons  gave  it  the  mus- 
cle to  make  its  influence  felt.  Germany  had  become  an  impor- 


352 


National  Security 


tant  trading  partner  for  Brazil  during  the  1930s  and,  because 
the  United  States  was  also  neutral,  Brazil  did  not  feel  uncom- 
fortable in  that  category.  Shortly  after  the  Japanese  attack  on 
Pearl  Harbor,  Brazil  broke  diplomatic  and  trade  relations  with 
the  Axis  powers  and  supported  the  anti-Axis  resolution  of  the 
Pan-American  foreign  ministers  meeting  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in 
1942.  In  the  summer  of  1942,  a  rash  of  U-boat  sinkings  of  Bra- 
zilian freighters  and  ferries  led  to  the  abandonment  of  neutral- 
ity in  favor  of  participation  in  the  European  war  on  the  side  of 
the  Allies. 

The  Brazilian  contribution  to  the  World  War  II  effort  was 
considerably  greater  than  it  had  been  during  World  War  I.  For 
example,  Brazil  permitted  the  United  States  to  establish  air  and 
naval  bases  in  the  Northeast  (Nordeste)  and  to  use  Natal  in  Rio 
Grande  do  Norte  as  a  staging  area  for  transit  to  Africa.  Brazil 
also  made  the  islands  of  Fernando  de  Noronha  available  to 
Allied  forces  as  a  base  of  operations  for  patrolling  South  Atlan- 
tic sealanes.  In  addition,  Brazil  placed  its  navy  under  United 
States  control  in  order  to  join  other  Allied  navies  in  antisubma- 
rine defense;  Brazil  provided  corvettes  and  destroyers  for 
Atlantic  patrols  and  for  convoy  escort  duty. 

Unlike  other  Latin  American  countries,  Brazil  dispatched 
troop  units  to  Europe  to  participate  in  combat.  The  Brazilian 
Expeditionary  Force  (Forca  Expedicionaria  Brasileira — FEB) 
reached  about  25,000  strong  in  Italy  in  the  summer  of  1944  to 
become  part  of  the  United  States  Fifth  Army.  The  FEB's  princi- 
pal fighting  unit,  an  infantry  division,  was  committed  to  com- 
bat that  September  and  remained  in  almost  continuous  action 
for  more  than  200  days,  winning  high  praise  from  Allied  lead- 
ers. World  War  II  and  the  military  alliance  with  the  United 
States  left  the  military  with  more  equipment,  enhanced  its 
organizational  and  individual  skills,  increased  its  prestige,  and 
ultimately  gave  it  what  it  had  lacked  since  1870 — combat  sea- 
soning against  a  foreign  enemy.  The  experience  of  the  FEB  in 
the  Italian  campaign  also  gave  the  army  a  popular  status  some- 
what separate  from  the  Estado  Novo  and  allowed  the  FEB  veter- 
ans (Febianos)  to  return  as  heroes.  After  the  war,  an  elaborate 
memorial  was  erected  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  to  honor  the  451  ser- 
vicemen who  lost  their  lives  during  the  conflict. 

Since  1945  the  armed  forces  have  not  engaged  in  interna- 
tional combat.  However,  Brazil  did  send  units  to  the  Suez  Canal 
in  1956,  to  the  Belgian  Congo  in  1960,  and  to  the  Dominican 
Republic  in  1965.  The  first  two  instances  were  in  response  to 


353 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

UN  requests  for  multinational  peacekeeping  forces.  The  third 
was  in  answer  to  a  call  from  the  OAS,  after  President  Lyndon  B. 
Johnson  sent  the  United  States  Marines  to  Santo  Domingo  to 
intervene  in  the  civil  war.  Brazil  complied  by  sending  the  larg- 
est contingent  of  non-United  States  troops  (1,000),  and  a  Bra- 
zilian general,  Hugo  Penasco  Alvim,  commanded  the  OAS 
forces.  This  was  called  the  Inter-American  Peace  Force  (Forca 
Interamericana  de  Paz — FIP). 

Brazil  has  been  reluctant  to  get  involved  in  international 
conflicts  that  might  require  military  action.  In  the  early  1950s, 
Brazil  politely  declined  the  United  States  invitation  to  send 
troops  to  the  Korean  War.  In  September  and  October  1990, 
Brazil,  anxious  to  win  the  release  of  200  Brazilians  being  held 
in  Iraq,  refused  to  assist  in  the  military  blockade  of  Iraq,  after 
Iraq  invaded  Kuwait.  In  stark  contrast,  Argentina  sent  two  sur- 
face ships  to  the  Persian  Gulf.  Brazil  did,  however,  comply  with 
UN  Security  Council  Resolution  661  and  cut  off  all  exports  to 
Iraq  and  Kuwait.  The  Central  Bank  of  Brazil  (Banco  Central  do 
Brasil — Bacen;  see  Glossary)  suspended  financial  transfers  to 
Iraq  and  Kuwait,  and  Brazil  also  observed  the  UN  embargo  of 
September  25,  1990,  on  air  cargo. 

In  the  early  1990s,  Brazil  became  increasingly  involved  in 
UN  peacekeeping  operations.  In  1993-94,  for  example,  Brazil 
sent  a  company  from  the  26th  Airborne  to  Mozambique  for  six 
months.  By  May  1994,  152  members  of  the  Brazilian  military 
and  police  were  involved  in  five  of  the  fourteen  UN  efforts — 
Angola,  El  Salvador,  Mozambique,  the  former  Yugoslavia,  and 
on  the  Rwanda-Uganda  border.  These  included  eleven  troops, 
sixty-six  police,  and  seventy-five  observers.  A  Brazilian  brigadier 
general  commanded  the  UN  officer  observer  group  in  1994- 
95.  The  officers  were  involved  in  nonmilitary  assignments,  in 
areas  such  as  medical  support,  management,  and  observation. 
Typically,  a  Brazilian  officer  was  assigned  to  one  of  the  opera- 
tions for  one  year,  before  being  replaced  by  a  fellow  officer. 
Brazil's  Congress  had  to  approve  any  contributions  to  the 
peacekeeping  forces.  In  1995  Brazil  sought  to  send  a  battalion 
to  join  the  UN  peacekeeping  force  in  Angola.  Although  the 
ministries  of  planning  and  finance  forced  a  delay  because  of 
budget  constraints,  a  Brazilian  battalion  went  to  Angola. 

Foreign  Military  Influence 

The  armed  forces  have  been  influenced  by  both  European 
and  United  States  doctrines.  The  French  influence  was  stron-

gest  at  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  up  to  World  War  I. 
Brazil's  navy  was  more  heavily  influenced  by  the  British  in  the 
nineteenth  century  and  by  the  Americans  from  World  War  I 
onward.  Brazilian  officers  served  on  United  States  Navy  vessels 
in  World  War  I.  In  the  early  twentieth  century,  German  influ- 
ence grew  in  Brazil  and  in  most  of  South  America.  From  1900 
to  1914,  many  junior  officers  spent  two-year  assignments  in 
Germany.  During  the  interwar  period,  French  influence  again 
predominated,  given  Germany's  defeat  in  World  War  I.  With 
the  reemergence  of  Germany  in  the  mid-1 930s,  German  influ- 
ence challenged  that  of  France. 

United  States-Brazilian  security  relations  can  be  understood 
best  in  the  context  of  the  broader  bilateral  relationship.  That 
relationship  can  be  characterized  as  one  of  asymmetrical  inter- 
dependence, in  which  Brazil  depends  more  on  the  United 
States  (especially  its  markets)  than  vice  versa.  Since  the  mid- 
1960s,  Brazil  has  emerged  as  the  dominant  actor  in  South 
America,  despite  pressing  political,  economic,  and  social  prob- 
lems. As  a  result,  Brazil  has  narrowed  the  asymmetries  in  its 
relationship  with  the  United  States  and  is  more  autonomous. 

One  implication  of  this  change  is  that  the  United  States  has 
less  influence  in  its  relationship  with  Brazil.  Another  is  that 
there  cannot  be  a  return  to  the  status  quo  ante,  when  Brazil 
was  perceived  as  a  "junior  partner. "  Brazil  is  a  qualitatively  dif- 
ferent country  than  it  was  a  generation  ago.  It  has  the  world's 
ninth  largest  economy,  a  population  of  more  than  160  million 
people,  and  a  broad  industrial  base.  Although  the  United 
States  is  still  the  dominant  actor  in  the  relationship,  Brasilia 
now  has  greater  leverage  in  its  dealings  with  Washington. 

As  a  parallel  to  the  changing  bilateral  relationship,  the 
tenor  of  United  States-Brazilian  security  relations  has  shifted 
over  time.  During  World  War  II,  Brazil  supported  the  Allies, 
and  Brazilian  troops  fought  alongside  their  United  States  coun- 
terparts in  the  Italian  campaign  beginning  in  1942.  In  the  post- 
war era,  United  States  security  ties  with  Brazil  were  close,  if 
somewhat  paternalistic.  Brazil  and  the  United  States  signed  a 
Military  Assistance  Agreement  in  1952,  through  which  the 
United  States  provided  most  of  Brazil's  major  weapons  and 
much  of  its  military  training.  Relations  between  the  two  coun- 
tries began  to  deteriorate  in  the  late  1960s  and  early  1970s,  as  a 
result  of  Washington's  restrictions  on  the  transfer  of  arms  to 
Latin  America  and  Brazil's  growing  assertiveness  in  its  foreign 
policy.

National  Security 


In  April  1977,  Brazil  abrogated  unilaterally  the  1952  United 
States-Brazilian  Military  Assistance  Agreement  in  reaction  to 
pressure  on  Brazil  by  President  Jimmy  Garter's  administration 
to  improve  its  human  rights  record  and  to  rescind  its  1975 
nuclear  accord  with  West  Germany.  The  abrogation  curtailed 
the  regular  flow  of  United  States  arms  to  Brazil  and  reduced 
channels  of  interaction  between  United  States  and  Brazilian 
officers,  especially  in  the  area  of  training.  The  termination  of 
the  agreement  manifested  a  more  aggressive  and  nationalistic 
foreign  policy  under  President  Ernesto  Geisel.  Moreover,  this 
was  reflected  in  Brazil's  industrial  prowess,  its  capabilities  as  an 
arms  producer,  and  its  diversified  external  ties. 

In  the  1980s,  the  United  States  and  Brazil  sought  to  improve 
security  ties  by  developing  structures  and  processes  that 
reflected  changes  in  both  countries  and  in  their  overall  rela- 
tionship. The  major  change  in  Brazil  was  the  continued  politi- 
cal liberalization  under  President  Joao  Figueiredo  (1979-85), 
with  the  eventual  return  of  civilian  government  in  March  1985. 
In  the  United  States,  the  administration  of  President  Ronald 
Reagan  distanced  itself  from  the  Carter  administration's 
human  rights  policies  and  took  a  more  pragmatic  approach, 
stressing  good  relations  with  Brazil's  military.  On  August  31, 
1983,  the  United  States  and  Brazil  signed  a  memorandum  of 
understanding  on  industrial-military  cooperation,  and  fre- 
quent meetings  were  held  between  high-level  officials  of  both 
countries.  Despite  these  and  more  recent  efforts,  security  rela- 
tions between  the  United  States  and  Brazil  have  remained  cool. 
A  variety  of  tensions  remain,  encompassing  broad  spheres  of 
the  bilateral  relationship,  including  technology  transfers,  and 
specifically  nuclear  proliferation — Brazil's  nuclear  and  space 
programs  and  their  potential  for  military  applications.  In  addi- 
tion, the  United  States  has  been  concerned  with  Brazil's  arms 
transfer  policies.  Increasingly,  however,  and  much  to  the 
annoyance  of  the  Brazilians,  the  issue  of  drug  trafficking  has 
dominated  the  agenda. 

The  transformation  from  bipolarity  to  multipolarity  has 
pressed  Brazil  to  further  diversify  its  foreign  relations  and 
strengthen  its  ties  with  countries  within  Latin  America  and  out- 
side the  region,  such  as  France,  Germany,  Japan,  China,  and 
the  countries  of  Central  and  Eastern  Europe.  The  United 
States  is  unlikely  to  be  displaced  as  the  major  external  actor  in 
Brazil.  However,  it  will  encounter  growing  competition  from 
the  rest  of  the  world.

The  traditional  sources  of  equipment  reflect  the  doctrinal 
influence  on  the  respective  service.  Thus,  the  Brazilian  Navy  at 
the  turn  of  the  century  depended  primarily  on  British  mate- 
riel. In  contrast,  army  equipment  came  primarily  from  France 
and  Germany.  After  1942  Brazil  depended  primarily  on  the 
United  States  for  its  imported  arms.  During  the  1970s,  Brazil 
became  more  self-sufficient,  as  it  produced  a  broad  array  of 
military  equipment.  In  addition,  Brazil  diversified  its  sources  of 
equipment,  turning  increasingly  to  Europe.  In  1994  and  1995, 
Brazilians  negotiated  to  purchase  Russian  military  equipment 
at  "cut-rate"  prices.  Nonetheless,  in  the  early  1990s,  the  United 
States  was  still  the  most  important  source  of  imported  materiel. 
In  addition,  the  United  States  has  participated  since  1959  in 
annual  naval  exercises  with  Brazil  (UNITAS)  and  has  been 
involved  in  numerous  fleet  exchanges. 

The  Military  Role  in  the  Intelligence  Services 

The  National  Intelligence  Service,  1964-90 

The  military-dominated  SNI,  which  the  Castelo  Branco  gov- 
ernment created  in  1964,  was  intended  originally  as  a  civilian 
agency  of  the  executive  branch.  Initially,  the  SNI,  under  retired 
General  Golbery  do  Couto  e  Silva,  freed  Castelo  from  depen- 
dence on  army  and  Federal  Police  intelligence  reports.  The 
then  head  of  the  army,  General  Costa  e  Silva,  feared  that  the 
new  agency  would  weaken  the  army's  secret  service.  However, 
by  the  end  of  1968,  with  the  triumph  of  the  hard-liners,  the  SNI 
took  on  a  military  coloration.  In  1973  it  secured  its  dominance 
over  the  so-called  intelligence  community  with  the  opening  of 
the  National  Intelligence  School  (Escola  Nacional  de  Infor- 
macoes — EsNI)  in  Brasilia.  The  following  year,  the  EsNI 
absorbed  the  ESG  postgraduate  intelligence  course.  Suppos- 
edly, the  EsNI  did  not  train  police  agents,  and  it  selected  its 
own  students.  By  1980  some  officers  were  saying  that  the  EsNI 
would  be  as  useful  as  the  ESG  to  their  careers. 

Alfred  Stepan  observed  that  the  SNI  differed  from  similar 
agencies  in  other  countries  in  that  it  enjoyed  a  near  monopoly 
over  operations  and  training,  and  that  the  SNI  chief  had  minis- 
terial rank  and  therefore  sat  in  the  president's  cabinet.  In  addi- 
tion, he  has  pointed  out  that  the  SNI  had  an  official  in  every 
government  agency,  in  state-owned  businesses,  and  at  one 
point  in  the  universities.  These  officials  followed  the  daily  func- 
tioning of  the  administrative  machinery  to  ensure  conformity 


358 


National  Security 


with  national  security  goals.  Moreover,  the  SNI  was  autono- 
mous, even  regarding  finances. 

The  SNI  served  as  the  backbone  of  the  military  regime's  sys- 
tem of  control  and  repression.  Although  there  have  been 
secret  police  in  Brazil  since  at  least  the  Vargas  era,  military 
involvement  reached  new  heights  with  the  creation  of  the  SNI. 
The  SNI  grew  out  of  the  Institute  for  Research  and  Social  Stud- 
ies (Instituto  de  Pesquisas  e  Estudos  Sociais — IPES),  which 
General  Couto  e  Silva  had  established  to  undermine  the  Gou- 
lart  government.  The  SNI  provided  clearances  for  anyone  seek- 
ing a  government  job  or  requesting  to  conduct  research  in  the 
army  archives.  Using  an  elaborate  system  of  informants  and 
telephone  taps,  the  SNI  accumulated  and  analyzed  reports  on  a 
wide  range  of  people,  organizations,  and  topics.  One  study  by 
political  scientists  David  V.  Fleischer  and  the  late  Robert  Wes- 
son suggests  that  there  were  as  many  as  50,000  persons  in  the 
employ  of  the  SNI  during  the  1964-85  regime.  Furthermore, 
both  Presidents  Medici  and  Figueiredo  had  been  SNI  chiefs. 

In  theory,  the  SNI  supervised  and  coordinated  the  intelli- 
gence agencies  of  the  three  services.  However,  in  practice  the 
service  agencies  maintained  their  autonomy.  The  service  agen- 
cies included  the  Army  Intelligence  Center  (Centro  de  Infor- 
macoes do  Exercito — CIE);  the  Air  Force  Intelligence  Center 
(Centro  de  Informacoes  da  Aeronautica — CIA);  and  the  Naval 
Intelligence  Center  (Centro  de  Informacoes  de  Marinha — 
Cenimar). 

The  chief  of  staff  of  each  of  the  army  commands  supposedly 
was  responsible  for  the  intelligence  work  in  that  command's 
territory.  In  practice,  that  officer  was  not  necessarily  informed 
of  CIE  activities,  which  followed  a  parallel  chain  of  command. 
Each  command  also  had  an  Internal  Operations  Department- 
Internal  Defense  Operations  Center  (Departamento  de  Oper- 
acoes  Internas-Centro  de  Operacoes  de  Defesa  Interna — DOI- 
CODI) .  The  DOI-CODIs  became  centers  of  dirty  tricks  and  tor- 
ture. 

From  the  outset,  there  was  resistance  to  the  idea  of  the  CIE. 
In  1966  President  Castelo  Branco  rejected  the  idea  of  creating 
an  army  intelligence  service  annexed  to  the  minister  of  army's 
office,  because  it  would  weaken  the  General  Staffs  influence. 
The  next  year,  the  new  minister  of  army,  General  Aurelio  de 
Lyra  Tavares,  established  the  CIE  over  the  objections  of  the 
chief  of  staff,  General  Orlando  Geisel.  As  early  as  1968,  the  CIE 
was  exploding  bombs  in  theaters,  wrecking  bookstores,  and 


359 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

kidnapping  people.  When  the  left  began  terrorist  violence  in 
late  1968,  the  CIE  expanded  to  about  200  officers  and  became 
the  axis  of  repression,  eliminating  all  signs  of  leftist  violence  in 
three  years. 

The  SNI,  CIE,  and  other  intelligence  agencies  were  the  most 
dubious  legacy  that  the  military  regime  left  to  the  New  Repub- 
lic. The  scars  of  repression  and  violence,  including  the  mis- 
treatment, torture,  and  murder  of  prisoners,  will  mark  the 
officer  corps  for  years  to  come.  During  World  War  II,  Brazilian 
officers  serving  in  Italy  with  the  FEB  (Brazilian  Expeditionary 
Force),  the  first  Latin  American  military  organization  in  his- 
tory to  participate  in  combat  in  Europe,  prided  themselves  on 
the  correct  treatment  they  accorded  German  prisoners  under 
the  Geneva  Convention.  Their  successors,  however,  were 
taught  that  international  law  did  not  apply  in  cases  of  internal 
security.  Thus,  they  used  massive  intimidation,  kidnappings, 
beatings,  secret  arrests  and  imprisonments,  psychological  and 
physical  torture,  murder,  and  secret  burial.  In  the  past,  rebels 
or  criminals  from  the  margins  of  society  and  working-class  peo- 
ple could  expect  brutal  treatment  from  the  forces  of  law  and 
order.  The  military  regime  brought  that  experience  to  the 
opposition  in  the  middle  and  upper  classes.  The  "repressive 
apparatus,"  as  it  was  often  referred  to,  cast  a  shadow  of  fear  and 
drew  an  invisible  pale  through  Brazilian  society  to  dissuade  the 
educated  classes  from  crossing  it.  It  also  served  to  dissuade 
opposition  within  the  military  itself. 

The  creation  of  the  DOI  network  beginning  in  1971  formed 
a  parallel  chain  of  command,  one  that  did  not  necessarily  end 
with  the  president  of  the  republic.  President  Geisel,  a  retired 
general,  struggled  to  have  his  orders  fulfilled  by  the  CIE  sys- 
tem. Consequently,  the  CIE  sought  to  undermine  his  govern- 
ment and  to  make  Minister  of  Army  Sylvio  Couto  Coelho  da 
Frota  the  next  president.  The  CIE  also  waged  a  pamphlet  war 
against  General  Golbery  do  Couto  e  Silva,  chief  of  Geisel's 
Civilian  Household,  who  wanted  to  shut  down  the  CIE. 

The  Strategic  Affairs  Secretariat,  1990-94 

When  Collor  de  Mello  became  president  in  1990,  he 
replaced  the  military-dominated  SNI  with  the  civilian-led  SAE. 
One  of  his  first  acts  as  president  was  to  dismiss  144  officers 
from  the  SNI.  Under  the  Collor  presidency,  the  SAE  emerged 
as  the  most  important  actor  in  formulating  Brazil's  security  pol- 
icies. In  part,  its  influence  was  derived  from  its  direct  access  to

the  president.  The  SAE's  oversight  responsibilities  included 
Brazil's  nuclear,  space,  missile,  armaments,  and  intelligence 
programs.  In  an  example  of  role  expansion,  however,  the  SAE 
drafted  the  1992  Multiyear  Plan,  a  document  formulated  previ- 
ously by  the  Ministry  of  the  Economy's  National  Planning  Sec- 
retariat, and  continued  to  have  a  strong  military  presence. 
Such  broad  activities  led  some  to  refer  to  the  SAE  as  a  "super 
ministry."  In  addition  to  the  SAE,  there  are  service  intelligence 
agencies. 

Despite  attempts  to  make  the  SAE  more  open,  there  was  vir- 
tually no  congressional  oversight  of  SAE  activities.  On  Septem- 
ber 26,  1991,  President  Collor  submitted  a  bill  for 
congressional  supervision  of  the  SAE's  intelligence-gathering 
activities.  According  to  the  bill,  the  secretary  of  the  SAE  would 
be  required  to  submit  a  confidential  report  to  Congress  every 
six  months.  Congress  criticized  several  provisions,  including 
the  exemption  from  congressional  oversight  of  intelligence 
activities  of  the  armed  forces  and  Federal  Police;  a  penalty  of 
imprisonment  for  three  to  ten  years  for  breaches  of  confidenti- 
ality by  Congress;  and  the  formation  of  a  joint  congressional 
committee  to  monitor  the  SAE,  thereby  bypassing  the  commit- 
tees that  already  existed  within  the  Chamber  of  Deputies  (such 
as  the  Committee  on  National  Defense)  and  the  Senate. 

By  mid-1992  it  was  clear  that  the  SAE  had  not  been  "demili- 
tarized," as  suggested  by  Collor.  Reserve  and  active-duty  mili- 
tary officers  continued  to  head  most  of  the  departments  and 
coordinating  sections.  Nor  did  the  SAE  effectively  oversee  Bra- 
zil's intelligence  apparatus.  There  was  evidence  that  the  intelli- 
gence branches  of  each  service  did  not  report  to  the  SAE.  In 
October  1992,  President  Itamar  Franco  appointed  Admiral 
Mario  Cesar  Flores  to  head  the  SAE.  Some  considered  this  mil- 
itary appointment  a  setback  for  the  "demilitarization"  of  the 
SAE  because  Flores  was  Collor's  minister  of  navy  and  was  con- 
sidered a  leading  proponent  of  Brazil's  nuclear-powered  sub- 
marine program. 

In  1995  President  Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso,  who 
assumed  the  presidency  on  January  1,  nominated  Ambassador 
Ronaldo  Mota  Sardenberg  to  head  the  SAE.  A  seasoned  diplo- 
mat, Sardenberg  was  a  former  ambassador  to  Moscow  and  the 
United  Nations,  and  was  widely  published  on  issues  relating  to 
Brazil's  foreign  and  security  policies.  President  Cardoso  also 
announced  the  creation  of  the  Brazilian  Intelligence  Agency 
(Agenda  Brasileira  de  Inteligencia  Nacional — ABIN).

Since  the  early  twentieth  century,  the  armed  forces  have  pur- 
sued the  goal  of  weapons  self-sufficiency.  Their  intention  was 
never  to  develop  a  large  arsenal  but  to  have  the  technical  capa- 
bility to  produce  the  arms  needed  for  Brazil's  military.  During 
World  War  I,  the  large  navy  was  cut  off  from  resupply  of  big 
gun  shells  and  became  a  paper  navy,  thus  reinforcing  the  drive 
for  self-sufficiency.  The  rapid  industrialization  that  took  place 
after  1930  provided  the  infrastructure  necessary  for  developing 
an  arms  industry.  After  World  War  II,  Brazil  developed  a  steel 
mill  at  Volta  Redonda,  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  State,  and  quickly 
became  the  largest  steel  producer  in  Latin  America.  In  1954 
Brazil  began  manufacturing  its  first  automatic  pistols.  The  ear- 
liest armored  personnel  carriers  (APCs)  produced  by  Brazil,  in 
the  1960s,  benefited  directly  from  some  of  the  technology 
developed  by  Brazil's  dynamic  automotive  industry.  Brazil's 
push  for  nationalization  of  the  computer-related  industry  in 
the  1970s  also  began  with  the  navy,  which  could  not  decipher 
the  "black  box"  computerized  range-finding  and  firing  mecha- 
nisms on  the  British  frigates  they  had  purchased,  and  did  not 
want  to  be  dependent  on  imported  maintenance. 

In  the  1950s,  Brazil  set  up  the  precursor  to  the  Aerospace 
Technical  Center  (Centro  Tecnico  Aeroespacial— CTA). 
Located  in  Sao  Jose  dos  Campos,  the  CTA  became  the  focal 
point  for  the  arms  industry.  The  CTA  has  trained  a  generation 
of  engineers  through  its  technical  institute,  the  Aeronautical 
Technology  Institute  (Instituto  Tecnologico  da  Aeronautica — 
ITA).  In  1986  it  was  estimated  that  60  percent  of  800  Embraer 
engineers  had  graduated  from  the  ITA. 

Brazil's  three  largest  arms  firms  were  established  in  the 
1960s.  Avibras  Aerospace  Industry  (Avibras  Industria  Aeroespa- 
cial S.A. — Avibras)  was  established  in  1961;  Engesa,  in  1963; 
and  Embraer,  in  1969.  It  was  only  in  the  subsequent  period, 
from  1977  through  1988,  that  the  three  firms  began  to  export 
arms  on  a  large  scale.  In  addition  an  estimated  350  firms  were 
involved  directly  or  indirectly  in  the  arms  production  process 
in  Brazil.  The  fourth  largest  Brazilian  arms  company  was  the 
War  Materiel  Industry  (Industria  de  Material  Belico  do  Brasil — 
Imbel),  established  on  July  14,  1975,  to  unify  the  army's  seven 
ordnance  and  ammunition  factories. 

Engineers  associated  formerly  with  the  CTA  created  Avibras 
as  a  private  aerospace  firm.  In  1964  Avibras  was  granted  the 
Sonda  I  rocket  contract  and  since  then  has  been  the  major  firm

involved  with  the  development  of  sounding  rockets  (Sondas  II, 
III,  and  TV) .  It  also  has  taken  a  leading  role  in  developing  mis- 
siles. In  the  1980s  and  early  1990s,  Avibras  worked  almost 
exclusively  with  the  manufacturing  of  rockets  and  multiple- 
launch  rocket  systems  (MLRS),  such  as  the  Astros  II,  in  addi- 
tion to  developing  antitank  and  antiship  missiles.  At  its  peak, 
Avibras  employed  6,000  people. 

Engesa  also  was  formed  as  a  private  firm.  Initially,  it  was 
involved  in  renovating  World  War  II-vintage  tanks.  Engesa  built 
wheeled  APCs,  such  as  the  EE-1 1  Urutu  amphibious  APG,  the 
EE-9  Cascavel  armored  reconnaissance  vehicle,  the  EE-1 7 
Sucuri  tank  destroyer,  and  the  EE-3  Jararaca  scout  car,  in  addi- 
tion to  a  wide  range  of  other  products.  Engesa1  s  APCs  were  all 
based  on  an  indigenously  designed  suspension  system.  Engesa's 
weapons  were  exported  almost  exclusively  to  the  developing 
world,  especially  to  countries  in  the  Middle  East,  Latin  Amer- 
ica, and  Africa.  By  the  mid-1980s,  Engesa  had  expanded  to  a 
group  of  twelve  subsidiaries  and  employed  more  than  5,000 
people.  By  that  time,  the  company  had  spent  US$100  million 
on  the  development  of  the  Osorio,  a  main  battle  tank,  but  was 
unable  to  find  a  buyer  for  it.  The  Osorio  project  came  to  an 
abrupt  end  with  Operation  Desert  Storm  against  Iraq  in  1991. 
In  1990  Engesa  had  won  the  evaluation  process  by  the  Saudis. 
After  Desert  Storm,  Brazil  was  no  match  for  United  States  com- 
petition, given  the  close  ties  that  developed  between  Saudi  Ara- 
bia and  the  United  States  during  the  war  with  Iraq. 

By  the  mid-1980s,  Embraer  had  become  the  largest  aircraft 
manufacturer  in  the  developing  world,  with  sales  of  more  than 
4,000  aircraft.  It  has  encountered  great  success  with  its  Bandei- 
rante  and  Brasilia  models,  sold  to  the  United  States  and  other 
foreign  countries.  In  1988,  at  its  height,  it  employed  more  than 
12,000  workers.  The  Brazilian  government  owned  about  5  per- 
cent of  the  company  but  controlled  most  of  the  voting  stock. 
The  government  supported  Embraer  with  generous  interest 
rates  on  its  loans,  a  reinvestment  of  profits  into  research  and 
development,  and  purchases  of  its  aircraft. 

By  1980  Brazil  had  become  a  net  exporter  of  arms.  On  the 
demand  side,  the  rapid  success  resulted  from  a  growing  need 
in  the  developing  world  for  armaments.  On  the  supply  side, 
Brazil's  arms  exports  were  designed  for  developing  world  mar- 
kets and  were  noted  for  their  high  quality,  easy  maintenance, 
good  performance  in  adverse  conditions,  and  low  cost.  The 
product  line  was  broad  and  came  to  include  ammunition,  gre-

nades,  mines,  armored  personnel  vehicles,  patrol  boats,  navy 
patrol  planes,  turboprop  trainers,  tanks,  and  subsonic  jet  fight- 
ers. 

In  the  early  1980s,  Brazil  emerged  as  one  of  the  leading 
armaments  exporters  in  the  developing  world.  From  1985  to 
1989,  it  was  the  eleventh  largest  exporter  of  arms.  Brazil 
exported  arms  to  at  least  forty-two  countries,  in  all  regions  of 
the  world.  By  far  the  largest  regional  market  was  the  Middle 
East,  to  which  Brazil  sold  approximately  50  percent  of  its  arms 
from  1977  through  1988.  According  to  an  estimate  by  the 
Stockholm  International  Peace  Research  Institute  (SIPRI),  40 
percent  of  all  Brazilian  arms  transfers  from  1985  to  1989  went 
to  Iraq. 

Brazil's  arms  industry  nearly  collapsed  after  1988,  as  a  result 
of  the  termination  of  the  Iran-Iraq  War  (1980-88),  a  reduction 
in  world  demand  for  armaments,  and  the  decline  in  state  sup- 
port for  the  industry.  In  early  1990,  the  two  major  manufactur- 
ers, Engesa  and  Avibras,  filed  for  bankruptcy. 

By  late  1994,  it  appeared  that  Brazil's  arms  industry  would 
not  disappear  completely.  It  was  unlikely,  however,  that  it  would 
return  to  the  robust  form  of  the  mid-1980s.  Avibras  had  paid 
off  a  substantial  portion  of  its  debt  and  was  seeking  ways  to  con- 
vert much  of  its  production  to  civilian  products.  Engesa  had 
been  dismembered;  some  of  its  companies  were  sold  to  private 
interests,  and  its  ordnance-related  companies  were  taken  over 
by  the  state  and  integrated  with  Imbel.  Embraer  was  privatized 
in  December  1994,  and  despite  significant  financial  difficulties, 
it  rolled  out  the  new  jet  commuter  plane  prototype  EMB-145 
in  1995. 

Mission  of  the  Armed  Forces 

The  Military  Mission  since  1988 

Article  142  of  the  1988  federal  constitution  states  that  "The 
armed  forces,  which  consist  of  the  navy,  the  army,  and  the  air 
force,  are  permanent  and  normal  national  institutions  orga- 
nized on  the  basis  of  hierarchy  and  discipline  under  the 
supreme  authority  of  the  president  of  the  republic."  It  adds 
that  "Their  purpose  is  to  defend  the  fatherland,  guarantee  the 
constitutionally  established  powers  and,  on  the  initiative  of  any 
of  said  powers,  law  and  order."  Significantly,  the  1988  constitu- 
tion fails  to  include  the  clause  that  the  military  only  be  obedi- 
ent to  the  executive  "within  the  limits  of  the  law."  Thus,  the 


366 


National  Security 


armed  forces  have  been  placed  more  firmly  under  presidential 
control.  According  to  Complementary  Law  No.  69  of  July  23, 
1991,  the  army's  mission  is  also  to  cooperate  in  the  national 
development  and  in  civil  defense. 

According  to  Article  84  of  the  1988  constitution,  the  presi- 
dent has  the  exclusive  authority  to  appoint  and  dismiss  the 
ministers  of  state,  decree  a  state  of  emergency  or  state  of  siege, 
serve  as  supreme  commander  of  the  armed  forces,  promote 
their  general  officers,  and  appoint  them  to  posts.  The  presi- 
dent may  also  declare  war  "in  the  event  of  foreign  aggression 
and  when  authorized  by  the  National  Congress."  He  also  pre- 
sides over  the  National  Defense  Council. 

There  has  been  little  debate  in  Brazil's  civil  society  regarding 
the  role  of  the  armed  forces.  Jose  Murilo  de  Carvalho,  a  politi- 
cal scientist,  has  called  for  such  a  debate,  arguing  that  it  is  nec- 
essary to  define  the  tasks  of  the  armed  forces  before  addressing 
issues  of  defense  expenditures.  Civilians,  however,  have  not 
taken  the  initiative  in  defining  those  tasks. 

The  military  has  been  seeking  a  new  role,  primarily  to  justify 
even  its  meager  budget.  The  armed  forces  have  seemed 
increasingly  irrelevant,  given  the  lack  of  an  external  threat 
(Brazil  is  involved  in  a  common  market,  joint  ventures,  and 
nuclear  cooperation  with  Argentina,  its  former  rival);  the  lack 
of  an  internal  threat  (no  political  group  in  Brazil  is  calling  for 
the  use  of  violence  to  overthrow  the  government);  and  the 
demise  of  communism.  In  addition  to  a  peacekeeping  role, 
some  of  the  potential  new  roles  for  the  military  include 
broader  participation  in  the  Amazon,  involvement  in  the 
counter-drug  war,  and  civic  action.  In  late  1994  and  1995,  the 
armed  forces  were  involved  intermittently  in  providing  public 
security  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  On  May  18,  1995,  Governor  Mar- 
cello  Alencar  appointed  hard-line  retired  General  Nilton  Cer- 
queira,  who  was  elected  federal  deputy  in  1994,  as  state 
secretary  of  public  security;  General  Cerqueira  was  well  known 
as  commander  of  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  DOI-CODI  in  the  1970s. 

The  Military  in  the  Amazon 

The  Amazon  region  occupies  more  than  half  of  Brazil's  terri- 
tory. In  1985  the  army  announced  the  Northern  Corridor 
(Calha  Norte)  project,  in  an  attempt  to  establish  better  control 
of  Brazil's  interests  in  the  Amazon.  The  project  has  consisted  of 
building  a  series  of  outposts  along  the  Brazilian  border  with 
Colombia,  Venezuela,  Guyana,  Suriname,  and  French  Guiana. 


367 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Some  of  these  outposts  have  been  established.  Calha  Norte  is 
therefore  more  than  a  military  project.  Its  goals  are  to  provide 
effective  control  of  the  border,  improve  the  local  infrastruc- 
ture, and  promote  economic  development  of  the  region. 

The  army  has  increased  the  number  of  posts  near  the  border 
from  eight  to  nineteen.  The  posts  are  placed  under  five  Special 
Frontier  Battalions,  with  headquarters  from  west  to  east  in 
Tabatinga,  Rio  Branco,  Sao  Gabriel  da  Cachoeira,  Boa  Vista, 
and  Macapa.  In  addition,  the  army  has  been  transferring  bat- 
talions from  the  South  and  Southeast  to  the  Amazon:  the  Sev- 
enteenth Motorized  Infantry  Battalion  from  Cruz  Alta  to  the 
Seventeenth  Jungle  Infantry  Battalion;  the  Sixty-first  Motorized 
Infantry  Battalion  in  Santo  Angelo  to  the  Sixty-first  Jungle 
Infantry  Battalion;  and  the  Sixty-first  Engineering  and  Con- 
struction Battalion  at  Cruzeiro  do  Sul  to  Rio  Branco.  The  First 
Brigade  in  Petropolis,  Rio  de  Janeiro  State,  was  moved  to  Tefe, 
Amazonas,  except  for  one  infantry  battalion.  Lastly,  the  army 
was  planning  to  open  two  new  garrisons  in  the  Rio  Negro 
region,  at  Tunui  and  Asuno  do  Icana. 

Some  Brazilian  officers  have  warned  against  "foreign  inter- 
vention" in  the  region.  In  July  1991,  Army  General  Antenor  de 
Santa  Cruz  Abreu,  then  chief  of  the  Amazon  Region  Military 
Command  (Comando  Militar  da  Amazonia — CMA),  threat- 
ened that  the  army  would  "transform  the  Amazon  into  a  new 
Vietnam"  if  developed  countries  continued  to  "international- 
ize" the  region.  The  vitriol  subsided  partially  in  January  1992, 
when  General  Santa  Cruz  Abreu  was  replaced  by  General  Car- 
los Annibal  Pacheco,  who  dispelled  some  of  the  concerns 
about  the  "internationalization"  of  the  Amazon. 

In  1993  the  Brazilian  press  reported  on  United  States-Guy- 
ana military  exercises  near  the  Brazil-Guyana  border.  The  prox- 
imity of  the  exercise  to  the  Brazilian  border  provoked  an  angry 
response  from  many  high-ranking  Brazilian  officers  and  gov- 
ernment officials.  United  States  joint  exercises  were  also  held 
with  Colombia  and  Suriname,  to  the  consternation  of  the  Bra- 
zilians. In  a  show  of  force  on  October  4,  1994,  the  armed  forces 
were  involved  in  Operation  Surumu,  the  largest  combined  and 
joint  maneuvers  ever  carried  out  in  the  Amazon.  The  exercises 
were  held  north  of  the  city  of  Boa  Vista  in  the  state  of  Roraima, 
over  an  area  of  34,900  square  kilometers.  They  included  the 
participation  of  eight  countries  in  a  war  against  Cratenia,  an 
imaginary  enemy.  The  exercises  involved  5,000  soldiers,  thirty- 
seven  aircraft,  four  ships,  and  two  hospital  ships.  The  army  had 


368 


National  Security 


the  largest  contingent  with  3,000  men.  The  air  force  dropped 
700  parachutists  into  the  jungle  and  was  involved  in  transport- 
ing most  of  the  troops,  many  by  civilian  aircraft.  The  navy  pro- 
vided logistical  support,  using  riverine  patrol  boats.  The  joint 
nature  of  the  maneuvers  indicated  that  whereas  the  army 
would  continue  to  take  the  lead  in  the  Amazon,  the  other  two 
services  (especially  the  air  force)  also  would  be  involved. 

However,  such  massive  operations  are  specially  staged  affairs, 
giving  an  impression  of  military  power  that  is  not  reflected  in 
the  day-to-day  reality.  The  commanding  general  of  the  First 
Jungle  Brigade,  headquartered  in  Boa  Vista,  oversees  two 
infantry  battalions,  whose  units  are  spread  from  the  Guyana 
border  to  that  with  Colombia.  One  battalion  headquarters  is 
located  in  Boa  Vista,  the  other  in  Sao  Gabriel  da  Cachoeira. 
The  general  does  not  have  his  own  aircraft,  and  he  must 
request  transport  from  Manaus  if  he  wishes  to  inspect  his 
troops.  Headquarters  maintains  contact  with  the  units  via 
radio.  The  first  battalion  maintains  five  Special  Border  Pla- 
toons (Pelotoes  Especiais  de  Fronteira — PEFs)  at  Bom  Fim  and 
Normandia  on  the  Guyana  side,  at  Pacarema  (also  called  BV-8, 
for  the  eighth  marker  on  the  Brazil-Venezuelan  line),  Suru- 
cucu,  and  Auaris  facing  Venezuela.  The  second  battalion  at  Sao 
Gabriel  da  Cachoeira  has  PEFs  at  Maturaca  (near  Pico  da 
Neblina)  and  Cucui  on  the  Venezuela  border,  and  three  more 
looking  toward  Colombia  at  Matapi,  Uaupes,  and  Iauarete. 

The  platoons  consist  of  about  seventy  soldiers,  corporals, 
and  sergeants,  and  five  officers,  the  most  senior  of  whom  is  usu- 
ally a  lieutenant.  Many  of  the  soldiers  are  recruited  locally.  In 
Roraima  many  of  the  soldiers  are  Macuxi  and  Wapishana  Indi- 
ans. 

In  late  1993,  the  armed  forces  received  presidential  approval 
for  the  Amazon  Region  Surveillance  System  (Sistema  de  Vig- 
ilancia  da  Amazonia — Sivam).  Sivam  will  consist  of  a  large  net- 
work of  radar,  communication  systems,  and  data  processing 
centers  and  should  assist  the  government  in  air  traffic  control 
and  its  efforts  to  curb  deforestation  and  drug  trafficking.  The 
control  centers  of  Sivam  will  be  in  Manaus,  Belem,  Porto  Velho, 
and  Brasilia.  It  will  take  at  least  eight  years  to  install  the  system, 
at  a  cost  of  US$1.55  billion.  Sivam  will  include  five  Embraer 
EMB-120  Brasilias  carrying  Ericsson  Radar  Electronics  Erieye 
airborne  early  warning  and  control  system.  Sivam  is  part  of  a 
larger  plan  called  the  Amazon  Region  Protection  System 
(Sistema  de  Protecao  da  Amazonia — Sipam).  The  purpose  of 


369 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Sipam  is  to  provide  a  more  sophisticated  infrastructure  for 
policing  the  Amazon. 

The  Sivam  case  was  particularly  controversial  in  1994  and 
1995  and  involved  Brasilia,  Paris,  and  Washington.  In  June 
1994,  two  days  after  then  United  States  Secretary  of  Commerce 
Ron  Brown  visited  Brasilia,  President  Itamar  Franco  decided  to 
award  the  Sivam  contract  to  a  consortium  led  by  Raytheon 
(United  States),  instead  of  to  a  group  led  by  Thomson  CSF 
(France).  In  December  1994,  when  many  legislators  already 
had  left  Brasilia  for  the  Christmas  holidays,  Brazil's  Senate 
approved  the  financing  of  Sivam.  A  Brazilian  senator  report- 
edly received  US$7  million  to  expedite  congressional  approval. 
In  February  1995,  the  New  York  Times  reported  that  the  United 
States  Central  Intelligence  Agency  had  discovered  that  Thom- 
son CSF  paid  bribes  to  Brazilian  officials.  French  diplomats 
countered  that  it  was  the  United  States  that  bribed  Brazilian 
officials,  paying  US$30  million  to  obtain  the  contract.  France 
charged  the  United  States  with  industrial  espionage  and 
expelled  five  staff  members  from  the  United  States  Embassy  in 
Paris. 

In  March  1995,  Raytheon's  Brazilian  partner,  Automation 
and  Control  Systems  Engineering  (Engenharia  de  Sistemas  de 
Controle  e  Automacao — ESCA),  which  was  hired  to  manage 
Sivam  and  to  develop  the  system's  control  software,  was 
removed  from  the  project  because  of  fraud  in  social  security 
contributions  in  Brazil.  In  its  place,  the  Brazilian  government 
proposed  a  team  of  Ministry  of  Aeronautics  experts.  However, 
wiretapping  and  alleged  influence-peddling  created  the  most 
serious  crisis  for  the  Cardoso  administration  in  its  first  year  in 
office,  and  threatened  the  very  future  of  the  Sivam  project. 

At  least  two  dozen  Brazilian  government  organizations  deal 
with  the  Amazon,  in  addition  to  many  nongovernmental  orga- 
nizations (NGOs)  from  both  Brazil  and  abroad.  The  vast  array 
of  organizations  reflects  the  many  interests  in  the  Amazon, 
which  include  concerns  with  national  security,  indigenous  peo- 
ples, economic  development,  the  environment,  and  drug  traf- 
ficking. These  interests  often  clash.  In  an  attempt  to 
coordinate  Brazil's  Amazon  policies,  President  Franco  created 
the  Ministry  of  Environment  and  the  Legal  Amazon  on  August 
18,  1993  (later  renamed  Ministry  of  Environment,  Hydraulic 
Resources,  and  the  Legal  Amazon),  and  placed  Rubens 
Ricupero  at  the  helm.  Ricupero,  the  chief  negotiator  of  the

1977  Amazonian  Cooperation  Treaty,  was  brought  from  the 
post  of  ambassador  in  Washington. 

President  Collor  established  the  Yanomami  Indigenous 
Park,  encompassing  9.5  million  hectares  of  territory  adjacent 
to  Venezuela.  The  reservation  is  home  to  25,000  members  of 
the  Yanomami  tribe,  10,000  of  whom  live  on  the  Brazilian  side 
of  the  reserve.  The  600  gold  prospectors  who  lived  on  or  near 
Yanomami  land  and  ignored  the  extensive  reservation  were 
expelled.  In  1992  President  Collor  demarcated  the  territory, 
and  in  the  following  year  mining  revenues  dropped  consider- 
ably. 

The  problems  associated  with  competing  interests  in  the 
Amazon  became  apparent  in  August  1993,  when  at  least  six- 
teen Yanomami  Indians  were  massacred  near  the 
Brazil-Venezuela  border.  Twenty-three  illegal  gold  prospectors 
were  arrested  and  charged  with  the  slayings.  They  were  later 
acquitted,  after  investigations  allegedly  indicated  that  the  Indi- 
ans had  died  in  conflict  with  other  Indians. 

The  governors  of  Roraima,  Amazonas,  and  Para  states  have 
called  for  the  reduction  in  the  area  of  the  reservations.  Accord- 
ing to  one  poll,  51  percent  of  Brazil's  legislators  agreed  with 
that  position.  Many  officers  within  the  armed  forces  have  also 
expressed  their  discontent  with  the  size  of  the  reservations.  A 
common  argument  is  that  there  are  few  Yanomami  per  square 
kilometer  allotted  to  them. 

In  early  1994,  there  was  a  broad  consensus  in  Brazil  on  the 
need  to  expand  the  military  presence  along  the  border.  Such  a 
presence  was  supported  by  Ministers  Ricupero  and  Flores.  Bra- 
zilians have  expressed  concerns  about  sovereignty,  particularly 
the  encroachment  by  the  United  States  and  others  via  drug 
interdiction  and  environmentalism.  Despite  such  consensus, 
however,  only  limited  funding  has  been  available  to  the  Minis- 
try of  Environment,  Hydraulic  Resources,  and  the  Legal  Ama- 
zon, and  the  constant  clash  of  interests  has  impeded  a 
coordinated  policy. 

The  Military  Role  in  Counter-Drug  Actions 

The  escalation  of  the  war  on  drugs  in  the  Andean  region  has 
led  narco-traffickers  to  change  their  shipment  routes,  and  Bra- 
zil increasingly  is  being  used  as  such,  especially  for  drugs  sent 
to  Africa  and  Europe.  In  addition,  some  drug  producers  in 
Colombia,  Peru,  and  Bolivia  have  used  Brazil  as  a  shelter  from 
security  forces  in  their  countries.  Brazil  is  a  major  supplier  of 


372 


National  Security 


precursor  chemicals.  In  the  early  1990s,  Brazil  created  the  Spe- 
cial Secretariat  for  Drugs  (Secretaria  Especial  de  Entorpe- 
centes — SEE)  to  coordinate  the  government's  counter-drug 
actions. 

Brazil's  military  has  been  reluctant  to  become  involved  in 
the  war  against  drugs.  Officers  argue  that,  according  to  the 
constitution,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Federal  Police  to  pur- 
sue such  a  war.  The  armed  forces  consider  their  involvement  to 
be  potentially  corrupting  and  are  loathe  to  become  entangled 
in  a  "no-win"  war.  Furthermore,  Brazilians,  like  other  Latin 
Americans,  are  sensitive  to  United  States  involvement  in  the 
region  and  fear  the  United  States  may  use  the  antidrug  role  as 
a  rationale  for  an  expanded  presence  in  Brazil.  From  1990 
through  1993,  the  United  States  provided  Brazil  with  approxi- 
mately US$1  million  a  year  for  anddrug  activities.  As  a  result  of 
United  States  Attorney  General  Janet  Reno's  visit  to  attend 
President  Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso's  inauguration  on  Janu- 
ary 1,  1995,  the  antidrug  agreement  was  renewed  in  April  1995, 
just  before  Cardoso's  official  visit  to  the  United  States. 

The  armed  forces  have  been  willing  to  provide  logistical  and 
intelligence  support  to  the  Federal  Police  in  the  war  against 
drug  trafficking.  They  have  also  become  increasingly  involved 
in  countering  the  spread  of  armaments  among  the  drug  traf- 
fickers. In  1994  there  were  an  estimated  40,000  illegal  weapons 
in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  The  constitution  gives  the  army  the  responsi- 
bility for  supervising  armaments.  In  addition,  the  army's  East- 
ern Command  has  provided  the  Military  Police  (Policia 
Militar — PM)  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  State  with  many  weapons, 
long-range  vision  goggles,  and  bulletproof  vests  for  countering 
the  well-armed  drug  traffickers.  In  October  1993,  the  army  pro- 
vided the  police  forces  with  7.62-millimeter  FAL  assault  rifles — 
the  first  time  such  rifles  were  used  by  police  forces  in  Brazil. 
The  army  also  trained  members  of  the  Special  Operations  Bat- 
talion (Batalhao  de  Operacoes  Especiais — Bope). 

In  October  1993,  some  police  officers  were  implicated  in  the 
smuggling  of  arms  to  the  traffickers,  and  as  a  result  the  army 
was  called  on  to  take  firmer  measures.  All  weapons  seized  in 
police  operations  were  to  be  put  under  army  control  in  mili- 
tary arsenals.  In  addition,  special  army  agents  were  to  work 
with  the  Civil  Police,  Military  Police,  and  Federal  Police  forces 
to  identify  the  traffickers'  arms  sources. 

Drug  trafficking  and  domestic  consumption  are,  by  all 
accounts,  on  the  rise.  Some  of  the  groups  involved  in  drug  traf-

ficking  control  entire  shantytowns  (favelas)  and  are  far  better 
armed  than  the  Federal  Police  or  State  Police.  In  October 
1994,  there  were  reports  that  up  to  70  percent  of  the  police 
force  was  receiving  payoffs  by  the  heavily  armed  drug-traffick- 
ing gangs  in  the  favelas.  Growing  public  demands  that  law  and 
order  be  restored  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  prompted  the  Itamar 
Franco  government  to  order  the  army  to  launch  an  offensive 
against  the  gangs  and  to  oversee  a  purge  of  the  police  force. 
The  army,  under  the  command  of  a  general,  mobilized  as  many 
as  70,000  soldiers  for  the  operation  in  the  favelas. 

The  task  force  that  identified  the  corruption  was  led  by 
Antonio  Carlos  Biscaia,  attorney  general  of  Rio  de  Janeiro 
State.  Corruption  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  was  widespread,  and 
included  the  Civil  Police,  Military  Police,  judges,  and  prosecu- 
tors. In  addition,  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  governor,  Nilo  Batista,  was 
induced  to  sign  an  agreement  with  the  federal  government 
allowing  for  federal  intervention  through  the  army,  which  took 
over  the  security  command  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  prior  to  the  1994 
gubernatorial  elections.  By  mid-1995  the  army  had  largely 
pulled  out,  but  the  security  situation  was  little  improved. 

Civic  Action 

With  the  possible  exception  of  military  officers  in  Peru,  the 
officers  in  Brazil  have  been  the  most  involved  in  civic  action  in 
South  America.  To  a  certain  extent,  the  civic-action  role  has 
been  appropriated  because  the  officers  consider  themselves 
responsible  for  the  guidance  and  development  of  the  nation. 
Civic  action  is  not  a  new  role  for  the  armed  forces.  Under  Var- 
gas the  army,  which  felt  responsible  for  helping  modernize  the 
country  through  a  more  elaborate  infrastructure,  was  involved 
in  development  and  reconstruction  projects.  Construction  bat- 
talions built  roads  and  railroads  in  the  interior  of  the  country. 
Officers  were  placed  in  high  positions  within  state  enterprises 
such  as  the  Volta  Redonda  steel  plant  and  the  Brazilian  Petro- 
leum Corporation  (Petroleo  Brasileiro  S.A. — Petrobras),  the 
petroleum  monopoly.  The  air  force  and  navy  were  involved  in 
transport  to  remote  areas,  and  in  health  care  assistance  to 
those  regions.  As  Professor  Fleischer  notes,  "This  new  mission 
reinforced  the  doctrine  of  industrial  development  as  a  basis  for 
national  strength  and  security  and  the  positivist  ideology  of  a 
technocratic  scientific  approach  to  national  problems." 

In  the  early  1980s,  the  army  was  again  extensively  involved  in 
civic-action  projects,  such  as  building  roads  in  the  Northeast 


374 


National  Security 


and  a  railroad  in  Parana  State.  Despite  the  reluctance  of  some 
officers  to  embrace  such  a  role,  cutbacks  in  defense  funding 
make  civic-action  programs  attractive. 

Defense  Expenditures 

Data  on  Brazil's  military  expenditures  need  to  be 
approached  with  caution.  Their  accuracy  is  complicated  by 
high  rates  of  inflation  since  the  late  1950s,  by  secrecy  surround- 
ing the  funding  of  various  military-related  projects,  by  person- 
nel costs  that  are  sometimes  hidden  in  other  budgets,  and  by 
the  common  practice  of  mixing  the  accounts  of  the  national 
treasury,  the  Central  Bank,  and  the  Bank  of  Brazil  (Banco  do 
Brasil — BB).  However,  even  if  the  figures  generally  attributed 
to  Brazilian  defense  expenditures  understate  their  true  value, 
there  is  consensus  that  Brazil  is  among  the  countries  with  the 
lowest  levels  of  military  expenditures,  and  that  those  levels 
have  declined  in  the  last  three  decades.  For  example,  the  rate 
of  military  expenditures  in  relation  to  GDP  has  dropped 
steadily:  in  the  1960s,  it  averaged  2  percent;  in  the  1970s,  1.5 
percent;  in  the  1980s,  1  percent;  and  in  the  early  1990s,  less 
than  0.5  percent.  In  1993  that  rate  reached  a  mere  0.3  percent. 
Brazil  in  1993  ranked  133d  out  of  166  countries  in  military 
expenditures  as  a  share  of  government  expenditures.  Within 
South  America,  only  Guyana  and  Suriname  ranked  lower. 

Political  scientist  Paulo  S.  Wrobel  notes  that  these  data  point 
to  a  correlation  between  the  type  of  government  (military  or 
civilian)  and  military  expenditures.  That  correlation  is  made 
even  clearer  if  one  examines  military  expenditures  as  a  share 
of  the  federal  budget:  in  1970  that  figure  was  20  percent;  in 
1993  it  was  only  1.3  percent  (see  table  28,  Appendix).  The  1993 
figure  was  the  lowest  since  independence  in  1822.  The  highest 
figure  was  in  1864  and  1865,  at  the  early  stages  of  the  Para- 
guayan War,  when  defense  expenditures  accounted  for  49.6 
percent  of  all  government  expenditures. 

Brazil's  low  level  of  military  expenditures  can  be  attributed 
to  the  perception  that  the  country  has  few  external  threats  and 
to  Brazil's  large  size  in  relation  to  its  neighbors.  In  terms  of 
threats,  the  deepening  integration  process  with  Argentina 
since  the  early  1980s  virtually  has  removed  the  only  potential 
external  threat  to  Brazil. 

Despite  its  low  rate  of  military  expenditures,  in  absolute 
terms  Brazil  is  by  far  the  largest  military  power  in  Latin  Amer- 
ica. In  1993  it  ranked  nineteenth  among  166  countries  in  total 


375 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

military  expenditures;  the  next  highest  in  Latin  America  was 
Argentina,  which  ranked  twenty-fourth.  From  1988  through 
1993,  Brazil's  military  expenditures  totaled  US$43.12  billion 
(in  constant  1993  dollars;  an  average  of  US$7.19  billion  per 
year).  They  totaled  US$10.6  billion  in  1996.  The  defense  bud- 
get in  1997  totaled  US$12  billion. 

The  armed  forces  have  had  some  minor  triumphs  on  budget 
issues.  In  early  1994,  the  Franco  administration  announced 
that  it  would  cut  US$22  billion  in  the  federal  budget,  dividing 
the  cuts  equally  across  ministries.  The  military  ministers 
reacted  quickly,  going  directly  to  the  president  to  criticize  the 
proposed  reductions.  They  succeeded  in  lowering  the  pro- 
posed military  cuts  by  at  least  US$300  million. 

In  late  1993  and  early  1994,  the  armed  forces  were  more 
vocal  in  their  criticism  of  the  low  levels  of  military  expendi- 
tures. They  pointed  out,  for  example,  that  the  air  force  work 
week  began  on  Monday  afternoon,  after  lunch,  and  ended  at 
Friday  noon,  before  lunch,  in  order  to  save  on  the  cost  of  feed- 
ing the  officers  and  troops. 

Military  salaries  were  raised  substantially  in  mid-1991  and  in 
April  1992.  According  to  one  report,  before  the  second  raise,  a 
four-star  general  with  forty  years  in  the  service  was  earning 
about  US$1,700  a  month,  and  many  soldiers  earned  only  a  few 
hundred  dollars  a  month.  In  contrast,  a  congressional  deputy 
earned  more  than  US$6,000  a  month. 

The  armed  forces  have  been  trying  to  protect  their  priority 
projects:  the  army — Calha  Norte  and  the  "defense"  of  the  Ama- 
zon; the  navy — its  nuclear-powered  submarine;  the  air  force — 
its  AMX  subsonic  fighter.  Each  project  has  had  special  funding 
from  the  federal  government,  aside  from  the  general  military 
budget.  Additional  funding  has  sometimes  been  available 
through  various  government  agencies. 

In  essence,  the  armed  forces  are  being  squeezed  in  an  unin- 
tended fashion  by  a  neoliberal  economic  model  that  stresses 
cuts  in  government  expenditures  and  privatizations.  Not  only 
has  their  budget  been  cut,  but  they  no  longer  have  the 
ready-made  sinecure  of  state  enterprises  in  which  to  work  at 
the  time  of  retirement.  Indeed,  under  the  military  regime, 
state  enterprises  became  bloated  with  retired  military  officers. 
A  1983  study  by  political  scientist  Walder  de  Goes  identified 
more  than  8,000  retired  officers  who  were  in  positions  within 
the  state  enterprises  and  federal  bureaucracy.

National  Security 


What  the  defense  spending  levels  suggest  is  that  the  military 
is  having  to  compete  with  virtually  every  civilian  ministry  and, 
in  many  cases,  is  coming  up  short.  Moreover,  even  though  the 
military  is  still  the  most  influential  player  on  some  issues,  the 
number  of  civilian  actors  involved  in  the  decision-making  pro- 
cess has  increased.  In  many  cases,  the  military  has  been  dis- 
placed by  civilians.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  become  the 
dominant  actor  on  budget  issues.  Although  the  armed  forces 
can  try  to  appeal  directly  to  the  president,  such  an  approach  is 
not  guaranteed  to  succeed.  Also,  the  armed  forces  must  deal 
directly  with  a  Congress  responsible  for  approving  the  budget. 

Organization  of  the  Armed  Forces 

Command  and  Control 

The  three  services  are  separate  from  each  other,  except  in 
three  areas:  the  Armed  Forces  General  Staff  (Estado-Maior  das 
Forcas  Armadas — EMFA),  the  National  Defense  Council  (Con- 
selho  de  Defesa  Nacional — CDN),  and  the  Armed  Forces  High 
Command  (Alto  Comando  das  Forcas  Armadas — ACFA)  (see 
fig.  13).  The  EMFA,  which  is  involved  in  planning  and  coordi- 
nation, interprets  interservice  views  about  policy  and  comes 
the  closest  to  functioning  as  a  ministry  of  defense.  It  is  headed 
by  a  four-star  general,  and  the  chair  rotates  among  the  services. 
The  ACFA  is  involved  with  more  immediate,  day-to-day  prob- 
lems. It  is  composed  of  the  ministers  of  the  three  services,  their 
chiefs  of  staff,  and  the  EMFA  chief. 

According  to  Article  91  of  the  constitution,  the  CDN  is  "the 
consultative  body  of  the  president  of  the  republic  in  matters 
related  to  national  sovereignty  and  the  defense  of  the  demo- 
cratic state."  The  members  of  the  CDN  are  the  president,  the 
vice  president,  the  president  of  the  Chamber  of  Deputies,  the 
president  of  the  Senate,  the  minister  of  justice,  military  minis- 
ters, the  minister  of  foreign  affairs,  and  the  minister  of  plan- 
ning. The  CDN  has  authority  to  "express  an  opinion  in 
instances  of  declaration  of  war  and  the  celebration  of  peace" 
and  to  "express  an  opinion  on  the  decreeing  of  a  state  of  emer- 
gency, state  of  siege,  or  federal  intervention."  In  addition,  the 
CDN  is  authorized  to  "propose  the  criteria  and  conditions  for 
the  use  of  areas  that  are  vital  to  the  security  of  the  national  ter- 
ritory and  express  an  opinion  on  their  continued  use,  espe- 
cially in  the  strip  along  the  borders,  and  on  matters  related  to 
the  conservation  and  exploitation  of  natural  resources  of  any

kind."  The  CDN  also  may  "study,  propose,  and  monitor  the 
progress  of  initiatives  necessary  to  guarantee  national  indepen- 
dence and  the  defense  of  the  democratic  state." 

Interestingly,  the  highest  level  consultative  body  available  to 
the  president  is  the  Council  of  the  Republic  (Conselho  da 
Republica).  This  body  does  not  include  any  military  minister 
or  officer,  although  the  president  may  call  on  a  military  minis- 
ter to  participate  if  the  matter  is  related  to  the  respective  minis- 
try's agenda.  According  to  Article  89  of  the  constitution,  the 
Council  of  the  Republic  has  authority  to  make  declarations  of 
federal  intervention,  a  state  of  emergency,  and  a  state  of  siege 
(all  security-related  issues). 

Army 

As  in  most  Latin  American  nations,  the  Brazilian  Army  has 
been  the  most  influential  of  the  services  because  of  its  size, 
deployment,  and  historical  development.  Not  only  did  senior 
army  generals  occupy  the  presidency  from  1964  until  1985,  but 
most  of  the  officers  who  held  cabinet  posts  during  that  time 
were  from  the  army.  In  1997  the  army  totaled  200,000  mem- 
bers. 

Considering  the  short  conscript  tour  (usually  nine  to  ten 
months),  the  army  has  a  high  number  of  conscripts:  125,000. 
Because  of  the  need  for  literate  and  skilled  young  men  to  han- 
dle modern  weapons,  the  army  has  served  as  a  training  ground 
for  a  large  reserve  force.  Its  highly  professional  officer  corps 
serves  as  a  nucleus  around  which  the  trained  service  would  be 
mobilized  if  required. 

The  noncommissioned  officer  (NCO)  corps  is  not  well 
developed.  NCOs  have  virtually  no  autonomy  or  authority. 
Emphasis  on  training  and  professional  development  is  for 
officers  only.  The  NCOs  account  for  slightly  more  than 
one-third  of  the  total  army  strength.  About  half  of  the  NCOs 
are  sergeants,  who  serve  as  command  links  between  officers 
and  ranks.  Some  also  serve  as  middle-level  technicians. 

In  the  early  1990s,  the  army  began  to  undergo  a  genera- 
tional change.  The  generals  of  the  early  1990s  had  been  junior 
officers  in  the  early  1960s  and  had  witnessed  the  military  coup 
in  1964.  Their  worldview  was  shaped  and  influenced  by  the 
anticommunism  of  that  time.  These  generals  were  being 
replaced  by  colonels  who  had  entered  the  army  in  the  early 
1970s  and  whose  view  of  the  world  had  been  shaped  less  by  ide- 
ology and  more  by  pragmatism.  The  United  States,  particularly 


379 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

through  its  counterinsurgency  doctrines  of  the  early  1960s,  was 
more  influential  with  the  older  group  of  officers. 

The  Army  General  Staff  (Estado-Maior  do  Exercito — EME) 
directs  training  and  operations  (see  fig.  14).  The  EME  has 
expanded  from  four  sections  in  1968  to  fifteen  sections  in 
1994.  It  is  headed  by  the  EME  chief,  except  in  the  event  of  a 
war. 

From  1946  through  1985,  the  army  was  divided  into  four 
numbered  armies:  the  First  Army  was  centered  in  Rio  de 
Janeiro,  the  Second  Army  in  Sao  Paulo,  the  Third  Army  in 
Porto  Alegre,  and  the  Fourth  Army  in  Recife.  Historically,  the 
First  Army  was  the  most  politically  significant  because  of  Rio  de 
Janeiro's  position  as  the  nation's  capital  through  the  1950s. 
The  Third  Army  was  also  important  because  of  its  shared  bor- 
der with  Argentina  (Brazil's  traditional  rival  in  Latin  America) 
and  Uruguay.  In  1964,  for  example,  close  to  two-thirds  of  the 
Brazilian  troops  were  in  the  Third  Army,  and  somewhat  fewer 
than  one-third  were  in  the  First  Army.  The  rest  were  sprinkled 
throughout  the  Second  and  Fourth  Armies.  The  Planalto  Mili- 
tary Command  (Comando  Militar  do  Planalto — CMP),  com- 
prising the  Federal  District  and  Goias  State,  and  the  Amazon 
Military  Region  Command  (Comando  Militar  da  Amazonia — 
CMA)  supplemented  the  four  armies. 

On  January  1,  1986,  the  army  was  restructured  from  four 
numbered  armies  and  two  military  commands  into  seven  mili- 
tary commands.  The  major  addition  was  the  Western  Military 
Command  (Comando  Militar  do  Oeste — CMO),  whose  terri- 
tory encompasses  the  states  of  Mato  Grosso  and  Mato  Grosso 
do  Sul  (previously  under  the  Second  Army  territory),  and 
Rondonia  (previously  under  the  CMA) .  Each  of  the  seven  mili- 
tary commands  has  its  headquarters  in  a  major  city:  Eastern 
Military  Command  (Comando  Militar  do  Leste — CML),  Rio  de 
Janeiro;  Southeastern  Military  Command  (Comando  Militar 
do  Sudeste — CMSE),  Sao  Paulo;  Southern  Military  Command 
(Comando  Militar  do  Sul — CMS),  Porto  Alegre;  Northeastern 
Military  Command  (Comando  Militar  do  Nordeste — CMN), 
Recife;  CMO,  Campo  Grande;  CMP,  Brasilia;  and  CMA, 
Manaus.  The  CMP  and  CMO  are  led  by  major  generals 
(three-star);  the  other  five  are  headed  by  full  generals 
(four-star).  The  army  is  divided  further  into  eleven  military 
regions.  The  CMSE  is  made  up  of  only  one  state,  Sao  Paulo, 
and  is  in  charge  of  protecting  the  industrial  base  of  the  coun- 
try.

National  Security 


The  changes  were  instituted  as  part  of  a  modernization  cam- 
paign to  make  the  army  better  prepared  for  rapid  mobilization. 
The  reorganization  reflected  Brazil's  geopolitical  drive  to 
"occupy  the  frontier"  and  the  growing  importance  of  Brasilia, 
the  Amazon,  and  western  Brazil.  In  1997  there  were  major 
units  around  Brasilia,  four  jungle  brigades,  and  five  jungle  bat- 
talions extending  from  Amapa  to  Mato  Grosso  do  Sul.  A  tour 
with  jungle  units  is  a  coveted  assignment  and  is  considered 
career-enhancing. 

The  move  to  occupy  the  Amazon  and  the  short-term  politi- 
cal implications  of  the  army's  reorganization  should  not  be 
overstated.  The  army's  geographic  organization  and  distribu- 
tion have  continued  to  reflect  a  concern  with  internal  rather 
than  external  defense.  In  what  is  perhaps  an  anachronism,  the 
CML  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  continues  to  have  some  of  the  best 
troop  units  and  the  most  modern  equipment  (see  table  29, 
Appendix) .  Command  of  the  CML  is  still  a  coveted  assignment, 
and  the  Military  Village  (Vila  Militar),  Rio  de  Janeiro's  garrison 
or  military  community,  is  still  considered  one  of  the  most 
important  centers  of  military  influence  in  the  entire  country. 
Principal  army  schools  are  located  there  or  nearby.  The  CML  is 
also  important  in  countering  the  trafficking  of  drugs  and  arma- 
ments. 

In  a  significant  political  development,  the  army  established  a 
formal  High  Command  in  1964.  Before  that  time,  a  clique  of 
generals  residing  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  controlled  major  decisions 
of  the  army.  Throughout  the  authoritarian  period,  tensions 
often  existed  between  the  High  Command  and  the  five  gener- 
als who  served  as  president.  This  tension  was  such  that  Presi- 
dent Geisel  dismissed  Minister  of  Army  Sylvio  Frota  in  1977. 
Since  the  January  1986  restructuring,  the  High  Command  has 
been  composed  of  the  seven  regional  commanders,  the  chief 
of  staff,  and  the  minister  of  army.  The  High  Command  meets 
to  discuss  all  issues,  including  those  of  a  political  nature,  and  is 
responsible  for  drawing  up  the  list  of  generals  from  which  the 
president  chooses  those  who  will  be  promoted  to  four  stars. 

Navy 

The  navy  traces  its  heritage  to  Admiral  Cochrane's  merce- 
nary fleet  and  to  the  tiny  Portuguese  ships  and  crews  that  pro- 
tected the  earliest  coastal  colonies  from  seaborne  marauders. 
The  navy  is  the  most  aristocratic  and  conservative  of  the  ser- 
vices and  draws  a  larger  share  of  its  officers  from  the  upper

middle  class  and  upper  class.  Although  it  is  involved  in  "brown- 
water"  (riverine  and  coastal)  operations,  the  navy's  primary 
goal  has  been  to  become  an  effective  "blue-water"  navy,  able  to 
project  power  on  the  high  seas.  Given  its  "blue-water"  bias,  the 
navy  is  even  less  inclined  to  become  involved  in  counterdrug 
operations  than  the  army  or  air  force. 

The  total  naval  strength  of  64,700  in  1997  included  Naval 
Aviation  (Aviacao  Naval)  with  1,300  members,  the  Marines 
(Corpo  de  Fuzileiros  Navais — CFN)  with  14,600  members,  and 
only  2,000  conscripts.  Naval  operations  are  directed  from  the 
Ministry  of  Navy  in  Brasilia  through  the  Navy  General  Staff 
(Estado-Maior  da  Armada — EMA),  six  naval  districts  (five  oce- 
anic and  one  riverine),  and  two  naval  commands — Brasilia 
Naval  Command  (Comando  Naval  de  Brasilia — GNB)  and 
Manaus  Naval  Command  (Comando  Naval  de  Manaus — 
CNM).  The  1st  Naval  District  is  located  at  the  country's  main 
naval  base  in  Rio  de  Janeiro;  the  2d  Naval  District  is  in  Salva- 
dor; the  3d,  Natal;  the  4th,  Belem;  and  the  5th,  Porto  Alegre. 
The  6th  Riverine  District  has  its  headquarters  in  Ladario,  near 
Corumba  on  the  Rio  Paraguai. 

Until  the  1980s,  the  flagship  of  the  ocean-going  navy  was  the 
aircraft  carrier  Minas  Gerais  (the  ex-British  H.M.S.  Vengeance), 
which  has  been  in  service  since  1945.  Purchased  from  Britain 
in  1956,  the  Minas  Gerais  was  reconstructed  in  the  Netherlands 
in  1960  and  refitted  extensively  in  Brazil  in  the  late  1970s,  and 
again  in  1993.  In  1994  Mario  Cesar  Flores,  a  former  minister  of 
navy,  declared  in  an  interview  that  the  navy  would  be 
hard-pressed  to  defend  the  Minas  Gerais  in  a  conflict.  Neverthe- 
less, the  Minas  Gerais  is  not  likely  to  be  replaced  until  the  next 
century.  The  navy's  priority  reequipment  plans  for  the  1990s 
include  the  receipt  of  new  Inhauma-class  corvettes,  the  con- 
struction of  Tupi-class  submarines,  the  refurbishing  of  the 
Niteroi-class  frigates,  the  acquisition  of  nine  new  Super  Lynx 
and  up  to  six  former  United  States  Navy  Sikorsky  SH-3G/H 
Sea  King  helicopters,  the  construction  of  the  conventional 
SNAC-1  submarine  prototype,  and  the  development  of 
nuclear-propulsion  technology.  In  addition,  the  navy  con- 
tracted in  late  1994  to  acquire  four  Type  22  British  Royal  Navy 
frigates  and  three  River-class  minesweepers  for  delivery  in  the 
1995-97  period  (see  table  30,  Appendix). 

After  years  of  intense  rivalry  between  the  navy  and  the  air 
force  for  the  control  of  naval  aviation,  President  Castelo 
Branco  decreed  in  1965  that  only  the  air  force  would  be 


383 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

allowed  to  operate  fixed-wing  aircraft  and  that  the  navy  would 
be  responsible  for  helicopters.  According  to  many  critics,  such 
an  unusual  division  of  labor  has  caused  serious  command  and 
control  problems.  The  complement  of  aircraft  carried  by  the 
Minas  Gerais  includes  six  Grumman  S-2E  antisubmarine 
planes,  in  addition  to  several  SH-3D  Sea  King  helicopters  and 
Aerospatiale  Super  Puma  and  HB-350  Esquilo  helicopters.  In 
accordance  with  the  Castelo  Branco  compromise,  the  S-2E  air- 
craft are  flown  by  air  force  pilots  and  the  helicopters  by  navy 
pilots.  A  crew  of  the  Minas  Gerais  with  full  air  complement  con- 
sists of  1,300  officers  and  enlisted  personnel. 

The  navy's  most  ambitious  program  is  the  development  of  a 
nuclear-powered  submarine.  The  program  enjoys  broad  politi- 
cal support,  including  from  the  political  left,  in  part  because  of 
the  perceived  technological  benefits  that  may  be  derived  from 
the  project.  As  minister  of  navy,  Flores  gave  the  development  of 
nuclear  propulsion  for  Brazil's  submarines  the  highest  priority. 

Air  Force 

Established  in  1941,  the  FAB  (Brazilian  Air  Force)  is  the 
newest  of  the  services  and  gradually  has  gained  a  larger  share 
of  the  budget.  The  strength  of  the  FAB — 50,000  members  in 
1997  (including  5,000  conscripts),  272  combat  aircraft,  and 
forty-five  armed  helicopters — makes  it  the  largest  air  force  in 
Latin  America  (see  table  31,  Appendix).  The  FAB's  budget  is 
relatively  large  because  of  its  civil  air  budget. 

The  minister  of  aeronautics,  in  addition  to  commanding  the 
air  force,  controls  all  civil  air  activities:  the  construction  and 
operation  of  airports  through  the  Brazilian  Airport  Infrastruc- 
ture Firm  (Empresa  Brasileira  de  Infraestructura  Aeropor- 
tuaria — Infraero),  and  air  traffic  control  through  the  Civil 
Aviation  Department  (Departamento  de  Aviacao  Civil — DAC). 
The  line  of  military  command  extends  from  the  minister 
through  his  chief  of  staff,  who  heads  the  Air  Force  General 
Staff  (Estado-Maior  da  Aeronautica — EMAer),  down  to  the 
commanders  of  the  three  general  commands:  General  Air 
Command  (Comando  Geral  do  Ar),  General  Support  Com- 
mand (Comando  Geral  de  Apoio),  and  General  Personnel 
Command  (Comando  Geral  do  Pessoal)  and  three  depart- 
ments: Research  and  Development,  Civil  Aviation,  and  Train- 
ing. There  are  also  seven  regional  air  commands  under  the 
General  Air  Command  that  cover  the  entire  country.  Num- 
bered from  one  to  seven,  the  headquarters  of  the  regional  air

commands  include  Belem,  Recife,  Rio  de  Janeiro,  Sao  Paulo, 
Porto  Alegre,  Brasilia,  and  Manaus. 

Personnel  and  Training 
Conscription 

According  to  Article  143  of  the  1988  constitution,  military 
service  is  obligatory  for  men,  but  conscientious  objection  is 
allowed.  Women  and  clergymen  are  exempt  from  compulsory 
military  service.  At  age  seventeen,  men  are  required  to  register 
for  the  draft  and  are  expected  to  serve  when  they  reach  age 
eighteen.  About  75  percent  of  those  registering  receive  defer- 
ments. Generally,  those  from  the  upper  class  and  upper  middle 
class  find  ways  to  defer,  and  as  a  result  the  ranks  are  made  up 
primarily  of  lower-class  and  lower-middle-class  recruits.  A  grow- 
ing number  of  recruits  are  volunteers,  accounting  for  about 
one-third  of  the  total.  Those  who  serve  generally  spend  one 
year  of  regular  enlistment  at  an  army  garrison  near  their  home. 
Some  are  allowed  six-month  service  terms  but  are  expected  to 
complete  high  school  at  the  same  time.  These  are  called  "Tiros 
de  Guerra,"  or  "shooting  schools,"  which  are  for  high  school 
boys  in  medium-sized  interior  towns,  run  by  army  sergeants. 
The  army  is  the  only  service  with  a  large  number  of  conscripts; 
the  navy  and  air  force  have  very  few. 

The  conscript  system  is  primarily  a  means  of  providing  basic 
military  training  to  a  sizable  group  of  young  men  who  then 
return  to  civilian  life  and  are  retained  on  the  reserve  rolls  until 
age  forty-five.  The  army  recognizes  that  it  provides  a  public  ser- 
vice by  teaching  large  numbers  of  conscripts  basic  skills  that 
can  be  valuable  to  the  overall  economy  when  the  young  men 
return  to  civilian  life. 

Ranks,  Uniforms,  and  Insignia 

The  three  armed  forces  use  several  different  uniforms, 
including  full  dress,  dress,  service,  and  fatigue.  The  army  ser- 
vice uniform  is  green;  the  navy,  navy  blue;  and  the  air  force,  a 
lighter  blue.  The  senior  commissioned  rank  (four  stars)  in  the 
army  is  general  {general  de  exercito);  in  the  navy,  admiral 
(almirante  de  esquadra);  and  in  the  air  force,  general  (tenente-bri- 
gadeiro)  (see  fig.  15).  In  time  of  war,  or  in  exceptional  circum- 
stances, a  fifth  star  may  be  worn  by  the  highest-ranking  officer 
in  the  army  (marechal,  or  general  of  the  army)  navy  (almirante, 
or  fleet  admiral),  and  air  force  (marechal  do  ar,  or  general  of  the

National  Security 


air  force).  Army  and  air  force  officers  wear  rank  insignia  on 
shoulder  boards;  navy  officers  wear  them  on  sleeve  cuffs.  Each 
service  has  ten  officer  grades,  excluding  officer  candidates. 

Army  officer  grades  from  second  lieutenant  to  colonel 
equate  directly  with  counterparts  in  the  United  States  Army, 
but  thereafter  the  systems  diverge.  A  Brazilian  brigadier  gen- 
eral (general  de  brigada)  wears  two  stars,  and  the  next  higher 
rank,  known  as  major  general  (general  de  divisao),  wears  three; 
their  United  States  counterparts  have  only  one  and  two  stars, 
respectively.  The  next  higher  rank,  designated  by  four  stars,  is 
general  (general  de  exercito).  The  marshall  wears  five  stars,  but 
that  rank  is  rarely  attained  on  active  duty.  There  is  no  rank  that 
corresponds  to  United  States  lieutenant  general. 

Brazil's  army  has  strict  up-or-out  retirement  rules,  which 
were  developed  in  the  mid-1960s  by  President  Castelo  Branco. 
The  internal  command  structure  determines  all  promotions 
through  the  rank  of  colonel.  The  president  is  involved  in  the 
promotions  to  general  and  chooses  one  candidate  from  a  list  of 
three  names  presented  to  him  by  the  High  Command.  Once 
passed  over,  the  colonel  must  retire.  All  colonels  must  retire  at 
age  fifty-nine;  and  all  four-star  generals  must  retire  at  age  sixty- 
six,  or  after  twelve  years  as  general. 

Despite  the  up-or-out  system,  under  President  Sarney  the 
army  became  top-heavy  as  generals  began  to  occupy  many  posi- 
tions that  previously  had  been  reserved  for  colonels.  In  1991 
there  were  fifteen  four-star,  forty  three-star,  and  110  two-star 
generals.  The  figure  for  four-star  generals  did  not  include  four 
who  were  ministers  in  the  Superior  Military  Court  (Superior 
Tribunal  Militar — STM).  Thus,  in  the  mid-1990s  the  army 
sought  to  reduce  the  number  of  active-duty  generals. 

Air  force  ranks  have  the  same  designations  as  those  of  the 
army  through  colonel,  and  there  is  also  no  rank  corresponding 
to  lieutenant  general.  Air  force  general  officer  ranks  are  briga- 
dier, major  brigadier,  lieutenant  brigadier,  and  air  marshal;  the 
five-star  rank  is  seen  rarely.  Navy  ranks  correspond  directly  to 
the  United  States  Navy  counterparts,  except  that  there  is  no 
one-star  rank,  equivalent  to  rear  admiral  (lower  half)  in  the 
United  States.  The  flag  ranks  are  rear  admiral,  vice  admiral, 
admiral,  and  fleet  admiral. 

The  highest  army  enlisted  rank  is  subtenente,  which  is  the 
equivalent  of  the  United  States  master  sergeant  and  sergeant 
major  ranks  (see  fig.  16).  The  navy's  highest  enlisted  rank  is 
suboficial,  which  is  the  equivalent  of  the  United  States  senior 


387

National  Security 


chief  petty  officer  and  master  chief  petty  officer.  In  the  air 
force,  the  top  enlisted  rank  is  also  suboficial,  which  is  compara- 
ble with  the  United  States  senior  master  sergeant  and  chief 
master  sergeant. 

Education  and  Training 

For  the  enlisted  personnel  in  the  three  services,  training  is  a 
constant  in  their  military  careers.  Much  of  their  time  is  devoted 
either  to  retraining  others  or  to  being  trained  themselves  in 
various  military  institutions.  Like  officers,  NCOs  who  aspire  to 
higher  ranks  are  expected  to  complete  advanced  training  and 
educational  courses.  Technical  courses  given  by  army 
branches,  for  example,  are  open  to  all  who  qualify,  and  compe- 
tition is  strong  for  the  courses  that  are  prerequisites  for 
advancement.  The  navy  and  air  force  also  have  educational 
institutions  to  train  technicians  to  operate  modern  weapons 
and  equipment.  These  training  courses  also  accept  some  for- 
eign students,  mostly  from  Latin  America. 

Officers  are  selected  and  promoted  through  a  rigid  system 
of  competitive  examinations,  mandatory  experience,  and 
review.  The  army  has  been  considered  a  vehicle  for  upward 
mobility.  Officers  were  recruited  traditionally  from  the  urban 
middle  class,  mostly  from  white,  Roman  Catholic  families.  They 
were  primarily  from  the  center-south  of  the  country.  According 
to  historian  Frank  D.  McCann,  data  from  the  Agulhas  Negras 
Military  Academy  (Academia  Militar  das  Agulhas  Negras — 
AMAN)  show  a  trend  in  the  army  in  recent  decades  to  reach 
farther  down  the  socioeconomic  scale  for  officer  candidates.  As 
a  result,  by  the  early  1990s,  few  entrants  were  from  the  upper 
middle  class  and  upper  class;  rather,  they  were  from  middle- 
and  lower-middle-class  and  lower-class  backgrounds.  There  was 
a  corresponding  increase  in  black  and  mulatto  cadets. 

An  example  of  the  importance  placed  on  education  by  the 
military  is  the  School  for  Sergeants  of  the  Services  (Escola  de 
Sargentos  das  Armas — EsSA)  (see  fig.  17).  The  EsSA  acquired  a 
reputation  for  excellence  in  the  post-World  War  II  period, 
when  the  drive  for  professionalization  of  the  military  was  par- 
ticularly strong.  Like  officer-candidate  schools,  the  EsSA  is 
open  to  civilian  applicants,  as  well  as  to  lower-ranking  enlisted 
personnel  who  aspire  to  become  career  NCOs.  Although  quali- 
fications for  admission  are  high  and  the  entrance  examination 
is  difficult,  competition  for  admission  has  remained  strong. 
The  year-long  course  of  instruction  is  weighted  toward  techni-

cal  subjects  to  meet  the  demands  of  advancing  technology  in 
the  services.  One  of  the  side  effects  of  professionalization  of 
the  NCO  corps  came  after  the  military  takeover  of  the  govern- 
ment, when  NCOs  demanded  and  received  the  rights  to  vote 
and  to  run  for  office.  The  constitution  of  1967  included  those 
rights  for  NCOs,  whereas  previous  constitutions  had  granted 
them  only  to  officers. 

Brazilians  consider  the  educational  systems  developed  for 
the  armed  forces,  particularly  in  the  army,  to  be  better  than 
most  in  the  world.  Many  officers  on  active  duty  enter  the  system 
at  the  secondary  level,  beginning  at  one  of  the  military  prepa- 
ratory schools  that  are  supervised  and  directed  by  the  armed 
forces.  The  navy,  for  example,  has  a  preparatory  school  in 
Angra  dos  Reis.  These  officers,  therefore,  begin  their  military 
careers  at  about  age  fourteen.  Qualified  graduates  of  these 
schools  and  other  secondary  schools  are  permitted  to  take  the 
written  examination  that  determines  who  will  be  admitted  to 
the  AMAN,  which  provides  a  full  four-year  course.  The  navy  has 
its  counterpart  at  the  Naval  School  (Escola  Naval — EN)  in  Rio 
de  Janeiro;  the  Air  Force  Academy  (Academia  da  Forca 
Aerea — AFA)  is  in  Pirassununga,  Sao  Paulo. 

There  has  been  an  important  change  in  the  AMAN's  recruit- 
ment policy.  Now  only  those  doing  their  third  year  of  high 
school  at  the  Campinas  Cadet  School  may  take  the  AMAN 
entrance  examination.  Those  enrolled  in  the  Brasilia  Military 
School  (Colegio  Militar — CM)  and  all  others  must  transfer  to 
Campinas  for  their  third  year.  Also  since  the  1970s,  an  increas- 
ingly higher  percentage  of  cadets  at  the  AMAN  are  sons  of  mil- 
itary officers  and  NCOs. 

Those  who  survive  the  competition  for  admission  to  the 
AMAN  enroll  as  cadets  to  face  a  difficult  four-year  course  lead- 
ing to  an  army  commission.  Since  1964  the  curriculum  has 
stressed  the  national  security  doctrine,  but  more  emphasis  has 
also  been  placed  on  social  science  courses  in  addition  to  the 
engineering  and  science  subjects  that  have  always  been  given 
priority.  Midway  through  the  course,  cadets  indicate  the 
branch  to  which  they  desire  assignment  (such  as  infantry,  artil- 
lery, armor,  or  engineering),  and  during  the  last  two  years  at 
the  academy  they  receive  intensive  specialized  branch  training. 

For  the  officer  who  aspires  to  high  rank  in  the  army,  success- 
ful completion  of  each  step  in  the  educational  system  is  essen- 
tial. For  those  who  would  be  generals,  finishing  each  academic 
step  in  the  highest  percentile  is  required;  high  standing  in 


391 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

graduating  classes  is  among  the  most  important  criteria  for 
promotion.  After  initial  branch  assignments,  the  system  begins 
for  company-grade  officers  with  attendance  at  the  Officers 
Training  School  (Escola  de  Aperfeicoamento  de  Oficiais — 
EsAO),  which  offers  a  one-year  Advanced  Course  that  is 
required  for  promotion  to  field  grade.  Routinely  during  their 
careers,  officers  maintain  contact  with  branch  schools  through 
correspondence  or  refresher  courses.  The  army's  premier  engi- 
neering school  is  the  Military  Engineering  Institute  (Instituto 
Militar  de  Engenharia — IME),  which  is  in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  and 
offers  technical  courses,  including  accredited  graduate 
courses.  The  IME  is  the  army's  counterpart  to  the  air  force's 
ITA  (Aeronautical  Technology  Institute). 

The  prize  achievement  for  any  army  officer  climbing  the 
rungs  of  the  educational  system,  however,  is  admittance  to  the 
Army  General  Staff  School  (Escola  de  Comando  de  Estado- 
Maior  do  Exercito — ECEME),  which  is  at  Praia  Vermelha 
beach  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  The  ECEME's  stiff  entrance  examina- 
tion weeds  out  about  75  percent  of  the  field-grade  applicants, 
and  without  successful  completion  of  the  two-year  course 
(reduced  from  three  years  in  1992),  promotion  to  general 
officer  rank  is  impossible.  Appointment  to  faculty  positions  at 
military  schools,  including  the  ECEME,  and  attainment  of  the 
highly  coveted  general  staff  badge  also  require  completion  of 
the  Command  and  General  Staff  Course. 

In  the  navy,  an  officer's  education  begins  at  the  Naval  Acad- 
emy (Escola  Naval — EN)  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  The  Naval  Academy 
provides  midshipmen  with  a  four-year  academic  course  equiva- 
lent to  that  given  to  cadets  at  the  Military  Academy.  Graduation 
is  followed  by  a  year  of  shipboard  training,  and  naval  officers 
also  attend  a  network  of  specialist  schools,  similar  to  the 
branch  schools  of  the  army.  In  addition  naval  officers  attend 
courses  at  the  Naval  Research  Institute  (Instituto  de  Pesquisas 
Navales — IPqN),  which  focuses  on  naval  science  and  technol- 
ogy and  on  research  in  advanced  concepts.  They  also  attend 
civilian  institutions  in  Brazil  and  the  Naval  Postgraduate  School 
in  the  United  States.  The  Naval  War  College  (Escola  de  Guerra 
Naval — EGN),  the  navy's  highest  educational  institution,  offers 
various  programs  for  qualified  officers,  depending  on  rank. 
The  EGN  is  located  at  Praia  Vermelha. 

The  education  of  air  force  officers  follows  two  different 
paths,  depending  on  whether  a  cadet  will  become  a  flying 
officer  or  a  technical  officer.  The  Air  Force  Academy  is  prima- 


392 


National  Security 


rily  a  flight  training  school  to  which  students  are  admitted  after 
completing  one  year  of  training  at  the  Air  Cadets'  Preparatory 
School  (Escola  Preparatoria  de  Cadetes  do  Ar — EPCAr)  in  Bar- 
bacena,  Minas  Gerais.  Technical  officers  are  trained  at  the  CTA 
(Aerospace  Technical  Center)  in  Sao  Jose  dos  Campos.  Before 
attaining  field  grade,  all  officers  attend  the  EsAO  for  courses  in 
command,  leadership,  and  administration.  The  next  step  is 
attendance  at  the  Air  Force  Command  and  General  Staff 
School  (Escola  de  Comando  e  Estado-Maior  da  Aeronautica — 
ECEMAR)  at  Galeao  Air  Base,  in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  but  admission 
requirements  and  the  entrance  examination  eliminate  many 
applicants.  Among  its  graduates  are  the  relatively  small  number 
of  officers  who  will  be  promoted  to  general  officer  rank.  Other 
air  force  schools  include  the  Air  Force  University  (Univer- 
sidade  da  Forca  Aerea),  the  Aeronautics  Specialists  School 
(Escola  de  Especialistas  de  Aeronautica),  the  Adaptation  and 
Instruction  Center  (Centro  de  Instrucao  e  Adaptacao),  and  the 
ITA. 

Some  Brazilian  officers  are  sent  to  military  schools  abroad. 
Brazilian  officers  have  attended  United  States  basic  and 
advanced  service  schools,  and  many  senior  officers  have 
attended  the  command  and  staff  schools,  as  well  as  the  service 
war  colleges,  the  national  War  College  (Escola  Superior  de 
Guerra — ESG),  and  the  Inter-American  Defense  College.  In 
the  1960s  and  early  1970s,  many  Brazilian  officers  joined  their 
Latin  American  counterparts  at  the  School  of  the  Americas,  in 
Panama.  During  the  period  of  strained  relations  between  Brazil 
and  the  United  States  from  1977  through  1980,  Brazilian  stu- 
dents were  rare  on  United  States  military  bases,  but  in  1981 
they  began  returning  to  the  United  States  for  training. 

The  top  of  the  educational  ladder  for  armed  forces  officers 
is  the  ESG  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  Students  are  selected  from  among 
colonels  and  generals  or  navy  captains  and  admirals,  as  well  as 
from  among  civilians  who  have  attained  high  government  sta- 
tus or  prominence  in  varied  fields,  such  as  business  and  indus- 
try, education,  medicine,  economics,  and  even  religion.  Since 
1973  a  few  civilian  women  have  also  been  admitted  to  the  ESG. 

The  ESG  academic  year  is  divided  into  segments  of  varying 
length,  during  which  lectures  and  seminars  cover  national 
security  doctrine  as  it  pertains  to  all  aspects  of  Brazilian  life. 
Several  weeks  of  discussions  on  basic  doctrine  are  followed  by  a 
longer  period  devoted  to  national  and  international  affairs  as 
they  affect  security  and  development.  Lecturers  include  senior

military  officers,  cabinet  ministers,  key  government  officials, 
academic  specialists,  and  occasionally,  foreign  diplomats. 

The  idea  of  establishing  the  ESG  grew  out  of  the  close  associ- 
ation of  Brazilian  and  United  States  army  officers  during  World 
War  II  and  the  experience  of  the  FEB  (Brazilian  Expeditionary 
Force).  After  the  war,  several  high-ranking  FEB  veterans,  dissat- 
isfied with  their  own  staff  operations  and  particularly  with  joint 
service  staffs,  requested  that  a  United  States  mission  be  sent  to 
Brazil  to  help  establish  a  war  college.  A  United  States  mission 
arrived  in  1948,  helped  with  the  founding  of  the  ESG  in  1949, 
and  remained  in  an  advisory  capacity  until  1960.  The  chief  of 
the  United  States  mission  held  faculty  status  at  the  ESG. 

Unlike  the  National  War  College  in  the  United  States,  the 
ESG  has  placed  greater  emphasis  on  internal  aspects  of  devel- 
opment and  security  and  on  civilian  participation.  The  ESG 
philosophy,  in  which  development  and  security  are  inseparably 
linked,  influenced  the  military  regime  from  1964  to  1985. 

The  influence  of  the  ESG  on  its  alumni  has  been  extended 
by  the  Associations  of  War  College  Graduates  (Associacoes  dos 
Diplomados  da  Escola  Superior  de  Guerra — ADESG),  which 
maintains  contact  with  graduates  and  keeps  them  informed  of 
ESG  policies  and  events.  The  ADESG  was  a  powerful  force  in 
the  military  governments,  always  keeping  the  ideology  of  the 
school  foremost  in  the  minds  of  the  many  graduates  who  had 
attained  positions  of  power.  The  school's  philosophy  was  incor- 
porated into  the  curricula  of  all  service  schools,  including  the 
army's  influential  ECEME. 

The  ADESG  holds  short  training  courses  (mini-ESG  courses) 
each  semester  and  recruits  ESG  candidates.  However,  the  ESG 
is  not  as  prestigious  as  in  the  1970s,  is  shunned  by  most  civil- 
ians, and  is  not  as  important  to  the  military  career. 

Sociology  of  the  Officer  Corps 

Throughout  the  period  since  1930,  officers  have  been  drawn 
largely  from  the  urban  middle  class.  Although  the  middle  and 
upper  classes  have  always  gone  to  great  lengths  to  avoid  having 
their  sons  serve  as  common  soldiers,  the  opportunity  for  a  free 
education  has  also  attracted  young  men  without  better  alterna- 
tives to  the  officer  corps.  Because  of  its  emphasis  on  education, 
merit,  and  performance,  the  officer  corps  offers  more  oppor- 
tunities for  advancement  than  is  the  case  in  the  political  and 
socioeconomic  spheres  where  family  ties,  friendships,  connec- 
tions, and  money  play  a  larger  role. 


394 


National  Security 


A  key  factor  shaping  officers'  attitudes  has  been  the  military 
educational  system.  However,  changes  in  location,  number, 
and  function  of  the  military  schools,  as  well  as  changes  in  cur- 
ricula, teaching  staffs,  equipment,  and  living  and  training  facil- 
ities, have  made  it  difficult  to  develop  lasting  traditions  and  a 
sense  of  commonality  among  the  graduates.  Moreover,  the 
changes  have  deepened  generational  divisions. 

Under  Brazil's  military  education  system,  officers  in  a  partic- 
ular class  form  a  turma,  which  is  often  a  lifelong  association. 
The  turmas  that  officers  are  in  at  graduation  are  monitored 
carefully  thereafter.  Since  World  War  II,  the  socialization  pro- 
cess has  involved  the  deliberate  reinforcement  of  turma  ties, 
including  the  interlinking  of  turmas  by  the  Armed  Forces  Gen- 
eral Staff.  For  some  officers,  the  process  may  have  begun  in 
one  of  the  twelve  Military  Schools  (CMs)  at  the  age  of  fourteen 
or  fifteen.  From  the  day  they  enter  the  AMAN,  marching 
through  the  new  cadets'  gate,  until  they  leave  through  the 
aspirants'  (aspirantes)  gate,  the  educational  and  training  experi- 
ence brings  them  together  in  a  world  that  emphasizes  unity 
and  performance. 

Spread  over  forty-two  weeks  each  year,  the  AMAN  curricu- 
lum blends  military  training  with  postsecondary  studies.  First- 
year  cadets  receive  eight  hours  per  week  of  military  instruction, 
while  second-  and  third-year  cadets  receive  twelve  and  sixteen 
hours,  respectively.  The  rest  of  their  time  is  devoted  to  physical 
education,  academic  subjects,  and  study.  In  January  and  Febru- 
ary, fourth-year  cadets  are  sent  to  units  in  the  states  of  Rio  de 
Janeiro,  Sao  Paulo,  or  Minas  Gerais  to  help  train  recruits  for 
four  weeks;  they  return  to  the  same  units  for  two  weeks  in  June 
and  a  week  in  October  to  gain  experience  with  the  same  sol- 
diers further  along  in  the  training  cycle. 

In  the  first  year  at  the  AMAN,  cadets  are  housed  by  turma, 
and  thereafter  they  are  quartered  in  multi-turma  groups  by  ser- 
vice and  branch — infantry,  artillery,  cavalry,  engineering,  quar- 
termaster, communications,  and  war  materiel.  This  early 
branch  selection  mirrors  Brazilian  civilian  university  proce- 
dure, which  also  forces  career  or  professional  selection  at  the 
outset.  Considering  that  AMAN  enrollment  averages  1,400  and 
that  graduating  turmas  tend  to  be  between  300  and  400,  it  is  rel- 
atively easy  to  know  a  large  number  of  contemporary  cadets.  As 
the  officer  progresses  from  aspirante  to  colonel,  the  turma 
becomes  an  increasingly  important  identification. 


395 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

The  army's  educational  system  reinforces  the  turmas  and 
seeks  to  knit  them  together  across  generations.  The  army's  per- 
sonnel department  tries  to  form  the  new  class  at  the  EsAO 
from  the  same  AMAN  turma;  the  same  is  true  for  those  who 
pass  the  competitive  examinations  for  the  ECEME.  In  the  inter- 
vening years,  they  have  served  together  in  units  throughout 
Brazil  and  have  formed  close  bonds  with  commanders  and  sub- 
ordinates from  other  turmas. 

Student  officers  reach  the  ECEME  in  early  middle  age  as 
majors  and  lieutenant  colonels.  They  usually  are  married  and 
have  children.  However,  many  officers  in  the  ECEME  cannot 
afford  to  bring  their  families  to  Rio  de  Janeiro  for  the  two 
years.  Except  for  the  few  who  have  their  own  quarters,  the  stu- 
dent officers  live  in  apartments  next  to  the  school  on  Praia  Ver- 
melha  for  the  two-year  course,  forming  tight  relationships  that 
embrace  whole  families.  Thereafter,  the  ECEME  relationship 
takes  precedence,  for  only  command  school  graduates  move 
upward.  The  ECEME  has  the  effect  of  producing  midcareer 
male  bonding,  and  it  turns  out  articulate,  active,  and  well-pre- 
pared administrators,  planners,  and  commanders. 

Within  the  turma,  ties  are  maintained  informally  by  birthday 
and  promotion  telegrams  and  by  meeting  for  discussions,  when 
a  number  of  members  are  stationed  near  each  other.  As  the 
turma  members  progress  through  their  careers,  they  tend  to 
expand  the  group's  contacts.  Turmas  may  attach  themselves  to 
an  upwardly  mobile  officer,  or  such  an  officer  may  seek  ties 
with  a  turma  in  which  he  has  trusted  men  (homens  de  confianQa) 
on  whom  he  can  call  when  he  has  openings  in  his  command. 

ECEME  instructors,  who  are  often  appointed  for  their  aca- 
demic achievements  and  staff  performance  and  who  are 
upwardly  mobile  by  definition,  establish  ties  with  the  turmas 
they  teach.  Often  when  these  instructors  hold  command  posi- 
tions, they  turn  to  their  former  students  to  fill  subordinate 
slots.  For  example,  Joao  Figueiredo  was  a  student  of  Ernesto 
Geisel  at  the  ECEME.  There  is  a  structural  link  between  the 
ECEME  and  the  AMAN  in  that  many  of  the  field-grade  officers 
assigned  to  the  AMAN  are  customarily  ECEME  graduates,  and 
by  regulation  the  history  and  geography  courses  must  be  given 
by  officers  wearing  the  command  school  insignia.  In  this  fash- 
ion, the  officer  generations  get  knitted  together,  thereby  con- 
tributing to  institutional  unity.  ECEME  graduates  shape  and 
execute  military  doctrine.  They  are  the  military  elite,  filling

staff  positions  in  the  national  and  regional  commands.  From 
their  ranks  come  all  the  general  officers. 

Officer  Recruitment 

Because  the  only  entry  into  the  regular  officer  corps  is  the 
AMAN,  its  records  provide  an  accurate  picture  of  the  officer 
corps.  In  the  decades  following  World  War  II,  cadets  from  mid- 
dle-class families  increased,  while  those  from  upper-class  and 
unskilled  lower-class  families  declined.  The  total  number  of 
applicants  also  declined  as  a  result  of  economic  development 
diversification,  which  gave  high  school  graduates  more  attrac- 
tive options  than  entering  the  military.  Increasingly,  AMAN 
cadets  came  from  among  the  graduates  of  the  army-supported 
Military  Schools,  which  sons  of  military  personnel  attended 
tuition  free.  Many  of  these  students  were  sons  of  NCOs  whose 
own  origins  were  not  middle  class,  so  a  form  of  intra-institu- 
tional,  upward  mobility  existed. 


397 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

The  trend  in  the  1960s  to  recruit  from  civilian  sources  has 
abated.  The  mental,  health,  and  physical  aptitude  tests 
excluded  large  numbers  of  civilian  school  graduates:  in  1977  of 
1,145  civilians  attempting  the  tests,  only  thirty-four,  or  3  per- 
cent, were  admitted.  In  1985  only  174,  or  11  percent,  of  the 
AMAN's  1,555  cadets  were  graduates  of  civilian  schools;  the  rest 
were  from  the  army's  Military  School  system,  the  Cadet  Prepa- 
ratory School  (Escola  Preparatoria  de  Cadetes — EPC),  or  air 
force  or  navy  secondary  schools.  In  the  early  1990s,  AMAN 
cadets  were  drawn  exclusively  from  those  who  had  completed 
the  EPC.  By  the  mid-1990s,  the  AMAN's  cadet  population  was 
about  3,000. 

In  the  twentieth  century,  the  officer  corps  has  been  com- 
posed predominantly  of  men  from  the  Southeast  and  South  of 
Brazil,  where  military  units  and  greater  educational  opportuni- 
ties have  been  concentrated.  In  1901-02  the  Northeast  contrib- 
uted 38  percent  of  students  at  the  army's  preparatory  school  in 
Realengo,  whereas  in  1982  it  provided  only  13  percent  to  the 
preparatory  school  in  Campinas.  In  the  same  years,  the  South- 
east supplied  40.4  percent  and  77  percent,  while  the  South 
gave  8.6  percent  and  6.3  percent.  Although  Sao  Paulo,  accord- 
ing to  Alfred  Stepan  and  other  observers,  has  not  been  noted 
for  sending  its  young  men  into  the  officer  corps,  its  contribu- 
tion increased  from  4.3  percent  of  students  in  1901-02  to  33.5 
percent  in  1982.  Regional  origins  of  cadets  at  the  AMAN  were 
fairly  consistent  in  the  1964-85  period.  By  far  the  largest  con- 
tingent came  from  the  state  and  city  of  Rio  de  Janeiro. 

Although  social  theorists  might  be  pleased  with  indications 
that  the  army  is  serving  as  a  vehicle  for  social  mobility,  army 
leaders  are  concerned.  Officers  have  remarked  on  the  trend 
toward  lower-class  recruitment  in  the  Training  Center  for 
Reserve  Officers  (Centro  de  Preparacao  de  Oficiais  da 
Reserva — CPOR)  and  the  problems  associated  with  such  offic- 
ers. In  a  1986  interview,  the  former  minister  of  army,  General 
Leonidas  Pires  Goncalves,  observed  that  he  did  not  want  offic- 
ers who  would  give  only  five  or  ten  years  to  the  army;  he  wanted 
individuals  with  a  military  vocation,  who  would  stay  for  a  full 
thirty-plus-year  career.  Many  officers  have  expressed  concern 
that  those  seeking  to  use  the  army  to  improve  their  status  are 
not  sufficiently  dedicated  to  the  institution.  Indeed,  some  offic- 
ers seek  the  earliest  possible  retirement  in  order  to  get  a  sec- 
ond job  (second  salary)  to  make  ends  meet.

Women  in  the  Armed  Forces 

Women  did  not  participate  in  Brazil's  armed  forces  until  the 
early  1980s.  The  Brazilian  Army  became  the  first  army  in  South 
America  to  accept  women  into  the  permanent  and  career 
ranks.  In  1992,  for  example,  2,700  women  out  of  5,000  candi- 
dates competed  for  136  positions  within  the  Officer's  Comple- 
mentary Corps  (Quadro  Complementar  de  Oficiais — QCO). 

To  begin  a  career  with  the  army,  women  must  have  com- 
pleted a  bachelor's  degree  in  areas  such  as  law,  computer  sci- 
ence, economics,  or  accounting.  The  competition  is  national  in 
scope,  and  no  applicant  may  be  more  than  thirty-six  years  of 
age.  Those  accepted  into  the  program  study  at  the  army's 
School  of  Administration  in  Salvador,  beginning  as  second  lieu- 
tenants (reserve).  The  School  of  Administration  is  also  open  to 
men.  At  the  end  of  the  one-year  course,  the  graduate  is  pro- 
moted to  first  lieutenant  in  the  permanent  ranks.  Generally, 
the  officer  is  assigned  to  Brasilia. 

The  navy  and  air  force  have  incorporated  women  in  their 
ranks,  but  in  the  Women's  Reserve  Corps.  Although  their  posi- 
tions are  temporary  in  nature,  with  regular  renewal  of  con- 
tracts these  women  can  rise  to  officer  status.  The  navy  and  air 


399 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

force  had  about  3,200  female  troops  and  officers  in  1991.  In 
1992  the  navy  promoted  its  first  women  to  the  rank  of  lieuten- 
ant commander.  The  three  services  are  committed  to  admit- 
ting women  in  their  military  academies  by  the  late  1990s.  The 
FAB  began  accepting  women  at  its  academy  in  1996,  but  not  as 
pilots. 

In  1991,  25,000  women  were  serving  in  state  Military  Police 
(Policia  Militar — PM)  units.  The  largest  number  (2,500)  were 
in  the  Military  Command  of  the  Southeast,  in  Sao  Paulo.  The 
women  generally  serve  in  health  and  administrative  positions, 
and  at  all  levels  of  the  hierarchy. 

Security  Forces 

Article  144  of  the  1988  constitution  states  that  the  public 
safety  function  is  to  be  exercised  through  the  following  agen- 
cies: on  a  national  level,  the  Federal  Police  (Policia  Federal — 
PF),  the  Federal  Highway  Police,  and  the  Federal  Railroad 
Police;  and  on  a  state  level,  the  Civil  Police  (Policia  Civil — PC), 
the  Military  Police,  and  military  fire  departments.  In  practice 
the  Federal  Railroad  Police  are  nonexistent,  and  federal  high- 
ways are  under  Federal  Police  control.  State  highways  and  traf- 
fic police  are  under  state  Military  Police  control.  The  Federal 
Police  force  is  very  small  and  plays  only  a  minor  role  in  main- 
taining internal  security.  Police  forces  in  Brazil  are  controlled 
largely  by  the  states.  Of  the  two  principal  state  police  forces, 
the  Civil  Police  have  an  investigative  role,  and  the  uniformed 
Military  Police  are  responsible  for  maintaining  public  order. 

Federal  Police 

The  purpose  of  the  Federal  Police  is  to  investigate  criminal 
offenses  of  an  interstate  or  international  nature;  to  prevent  and 
suppress  illicit  traffic  in  narcotics  and  related  drugs;  to  per- 
form the  functions  of  a  coast  guard  (enforcement  only),  air 
police,  and  border  patrol;  and  to  perform  the  functions  of  the 
judicial  police.  The  Federal  Police  force  is  structured  as  a 
career  service. 

Officially,  the  Federal  Police  force  is  known  as  the  Depart- 
ment of  Federal  Police  (Departamento  de  Policia  Federal — 
DPF)  and  is  headquartered  in  Brasilia.  In  addition  to  the  Fede- 
ral District,  DPF  units  are  distributed  throughout  the  states  and 
territories.  The  DPF  headquarters  provides  technical  services 
relating  to  data  processing,  collection  and  dissemination  of 


400 


National  Security 


police  intelligence,  and  scientific  assistance  to  the  Military 
Police.  The  DPF  headquarters  is  also  responsible  for  Brazil's 
input  to  and  cooperation  with  the  Paris-based  International 
Criminal  Police  Organization  (Interpol).  Among  the  many 
agencies  subordinate  to  the  DPF  are  the  National  Police  Acad- 
emy, the  National  Institute  of  Criminology,  and  the  National 
Institute  of  Identification,  all  in  Brasilia. 

The  DPF  is  headed  by  a  general  director,  who  is  appointed 
by  the  president.  Under  the  military  regime,  the  general  direc- 
tor was  usually  an  active-duty  army  general.  Since  the  return  to 
civilian  rule,  the  general  director  usually  has  been  a  civilian. 
On  July  8,  1993,  President  Franco  appointed  a  retired  army 
officer  to  be  general  director  of  the  DPF.  Many  within  the  DPF 
were  outraged  and  started  an  unsuccessful  six-day  strike.  They 
requested  the  removal  of  the  appointee,  in  addition  to  better 
equipment  and  better  salaries.  Fifteen  of  twenty-four  regional 
superintendents  and  270  police  chiefs  resigned  in  protest.  The 
strike  ended  when  Franco  promised  to  look  into  various  com- 
plaints. The  appointee,  however,  kept  his  position. 

Indeed,  the  DPF  force  was  experiencing  deteriorating  work- 
ing conditions  in  the  early  1990s.  In  1992  it  had  a  major  budget 
deficit.  The  entire  1993  budget  was  spent  by  June  of  that  year, 
and  the  force  was  threatened  with  eviction  from  all  thirty-one 
buildings  that  it  rented.  The  DPF  office  complained  that  the 
drug  traffickers  were  better  equipped  than  they  were. 

State  Police 

The  State  Police  forces,  nominally  under  the  supervision  of 
the  state  governors,  are  in  fact  associated  closely  with  federal 
authorities.  The  State  Police,  by  definition,  are  powerful  forces 
in  their  states  because  municipal  police  generally  do  not  exist 
(although  municipal  guard  forces  are  allowed,  according  to 
Article  144  of  the  constitution).  The  city  of  Sao  Paulo  is  a  nota- 
ble exception.  Its  mayor,  Janio  Quadros  (elected  in  1985),  cre- 
ated a  municipal  police  force.  All  police  functions  not 
performed  by  DPF  personnel  are  responsibilities  of  the  state 
forces.  State  Police  consist  generally  of  two  separate  forces:  the 
Civil  Police  and  the  Military  Police,  sometimes  referred  to  as 
the  State  Militia  (Policia  Militar  do  Estado) .  The  Secretariat  for 
Public  Security  (Secretaria  de  Seguranca  Publica — SSP),  an 
important  agency  of  each  state  government,  supervises  police 
activities.  The  SSPs  are  subordinate  to  the  National  Council  of 


401 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Public  Security  (Conselho  Nacional  de  Seguranca  Publica — 
Conasp). 

Each  state  also  maintains  a  Civil  Police  force,  which,  accord- 
ing to  Article  144  of  the  constitution,  is  responsible  for  "the 
duties  of  a  judicial  police  force  and  for  investigating  criminal 
offenses,  except  military  criminal  offenses."  Given  that  there 
are  virtually  no  municipal  police,  the  state  forces  are  stationed 
in  populated  areas  and  are  responsible  for  all  police  functions. 
Cities  are  divided  into  precincts  through  which  the  Civil  Police 
operate,  using  methods  familiar  to  police  squads  in  most  other 
countries.  Police  chiefs  are  known  as  delegates  (delegados),  and 
the  force  is  usually  commanded  by  the  general  delegate  (dele- 
gado  general),  whose  rank  is  equal  to  that  of  the  commandant  of 
the  Military  Police.  A  delegado  must  have  a  law  degree,  and  is 
selected  by  public  examination.  Lower-ranking  officers  are 
known  as  investigators.  Promotion  to  the  higher  ranks  of  the 
Civil  Police  usually  requires  a  law  degree. 

In  1997  there  were  385,600  members  of  state  Military  Police 
organizations  in  Brazil.  They  are  ultimately  under  army  control 
and  considered  an  army  reserve.  A  Military  Police  Women's 
Company  was  established  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1982.  According 
to  Article  144  of  the  constitution,  the  function  of  the  Military 
Police  "is  to  serve  as  a  conspicuous  police  force  and  to  preserve 
public  order."  The  Military  Police  of  any  state  are  organized  as 
a  military  force  and  have  a  military-based  rank  structure.  Train- 
ing is  weighted  more  heavily  toward  police  matters,  but  coun- 
terinsurgency  training  is  also  included.  Arms  and  equipment  of 
state  forces  include  machine  guns  and  armored  cars,  in  addi- 
tion to  other  items  generally  associated  with  police. 

Article  144  of  the  constitution  stipulates  that:  "The  Military 
Police  forces  and  the  military  fire  departments,  and  the  auxil- 
iary forces  and  the  Army  Reserve  are  subordinate,  along  with 
the  civilian  police  forces,  to  the  governors  of  the  states,  the 
Federal  District,  and  the  territories."  Since  1969  the  Ministry  of 
Army  has  controlled  the  Military  Police  during  periods  of 
declared  national  emergency.  Before  1930  these  forces  were 
under  individual  state  control,  and  known  as  "the  governors' 
armies."  They  sometimes  outnumbered  regular  troops  in  many 
states.  In  the  1930s,  the  Federal  Army  took  steps  to  reverse  this 
situation.  In  1964  most  Military  Police  members  were  on  the 
side  of  the  successful  conspirators.

mobilized  quickly  to  augment  the  armed  forces  in  an  emer-

gency.  In  the  past,  Military  Police  units  were  often  commanded 
by  active-duty  army  officers,  but  that  has  occurred  less  fre- 
quently as  professional  police  officers  have  achieved  higher 
ranks  and  positions.  The  commandant  of  a  state's  Military 
Police  is  usually  a  colonel.  The  command  is  divided  into  police 
regions,  which  deploy  police  battalions  and  companies.  Fire- 
fighting  is  also  a  Military  Police  function;  firefighters  are  orga- 
nized in  separate  battalions.  State  traffic  police  are  either  the 
State  Highway  Police  (Policia  Rodoviaria  Estadual),  or  the  Traf- 
fic Police  (Policia  de  Trafego)  in  the  larger  cities.  Both  are  part 
of  the  state  Military  Police. 

Elements  within  the  Military  Police  in  some  states  have  been 
notorious  for  their  vigilantism  and  death-squad  activities,  many 
against  minors.  On  July  19,  1993,  sixteen  Military  Police  mem- 
bers were  arrested  in  the  state  of  Alagoas  and  accused  of  killing 
sixty-nine  people.  On  July  23,  1993,  eight  street  children  were 
killed  outside  of  Candelaria  Church  (Igreja  da  Candelaria),  in 
Rio  de  Janeiro.  The  international  response  was  one  of  outrage. 
Four  military  policemen,  including  a  lieutenant,  were  arrested 
and  eventually  convicted.  On  August  30,  1993,  thirty  armed 
men  wearing  hoods  entered  Vigario  Geral,  a  favela  in  Rio  de 
Janeiro,  and  set  fires,  destroyed  homes,  and  shot  randomly,  kill- 
ing twenty-one  people.  Favela  residents  claimed  that  the  assas- 
sins were  Military  Police  avenging  the  killing  of  four  of  their 
members  by  drug  traffickers  in  the  shantytown.  Later  investiga- 
tions substantiated  those  charges.  Because  of  such  activities, 
the  Federal  Police  have  been  called  in  to  investigate. 

Various  studies  conducted  in  Brazil  and  abroad  have  linked 
the  Military  Police  to  the  death  squads.  Social  scientist  Paulo 
Sergio  Pinheiro,  of  the  University  of  Sao  Paulo's  Center  for 
Studies  of  Violence  (Nucleo  de  Estudos  de  Violencia — NEV), 
stated  in  1993  that  "Brazil's  Military  Police  are  among  the  most 
violent  police  forces  in  the  Third  World."  According  to  one 
explanation,  vigilantism  is  an  expression  of  frustration  with  a 
legal  system  that  is  perceived  to  be  inefficient  and  corrupt,  a 
court  system  that  is  backlogged,  and  jails  that  are  overcrowded. 
Indeed  there  is  significant  popular  support  for  death-squad 
activity. 

Crime  and  Punishment 

Crime 

There  are  few  reliable  statistics  on  the  incidence  of  crime  in 


403 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Brazil.  The  United  States  Department  of  State,  in  its  Country 
Reports  on  Human  Rights  Practices  for  1995,  concluded  that  "A 
high  crime  rate,  a  failure  to  apprehend  most  criminals,  and  an 
inept  criminal  justice  system  all  contribute  to  public  acquies- 
cence in  police  brutality  and  killings  of  criminal  suspects.  Acts 
of  intimidation,  including  death  threats  against  witnesses,  pros- 
ecutors, judges,  and  human  rights  monitors,  often  hindered 
investigation  into  these  incidents."  Intimidation  seems  to  be 
most  prevalent  in  the  rural  areas  of  the  North  and  Northeast, 
where  large  landowners  often  threaten  police,  judges,  lawyers, 
and  reporters. 

The  skewed  distribution  of  income  in  Brazil  (one  of  the 
most  unequal  in  the  world)  may  be  partially  responsible  for  an 
endemic  and  increasing  problem  of  nonpolitical  crime.  Since 
returning  to  civilian  government,  Brazil  has  experienced  a  dra- 
matic increase  in  the  level  of  crime.  In  1992  Brazil's  homicide 
rate  of  37.5  per  100,000  residents  surpassed  that  of  the  United 
States,  with  22.76  per  100,000.  Rio  de  Janeiro  registered  4,253 
murders  in  1993,  up  from  3,545  in  1992.  Rio  de  Janeiro  had 
seventy-two  murders  per  100,000  residents  in  1993,  compared 
with  thirty  per  100,000  in  New  York  City.  Meanwhile,  Rio  de 
Janeiro  State  spending  on  security  dropped  from  15  percent  of 
the  state  budget  in  1984  to  8  percent  in  1994. 

As  discussed  earlier  in  this  chapter,  the  rapid  increase  in  the 
level  of  drug  trafficking  in  Brazil  raises  numerous  security 
issues.  One  has  to  do  with  the  very  control  of  national  territory, 
as  drug  traffickers  operate  in  the  vast  expanses  of  the  Amazon 
and  other  regions.  Indeed  the  threat  of  drug  trafficking  was 
used  to  justify  the  costly  Sivam  (Amazon  Region  Surveillance 
System)  project.  A  second  issue  has  to  do  with  state  control  of 
entire  favelas  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  possibly  in  other  cities, 
where  drug  traffickers  have  a  virtual  monopoly  over  force.  A 
third  issue  is  that  of  potential  corruption  of  the  security  forces, 
at  all  levels. 

The  shortcomings  of  the  judicial  system  lead  the  public  to 
tolerate  vigilantism,  in  the  form  of  lynching  of  suspected  crimi- 
nals. In  Bahia  State,  for  example,  eighty-four  documented 
cases  of  lynching  occurred  in  1993.  In  at  least  one  case,  the 
lynching  occurred  while  the  police  watched. 

Penal  Code 

The  Penal  Code  has  been  amended  considerably  since  its 
adoption  in  1940  as  a  replacement  for  an  older  code.  The 


404 


National  Security 


Penal  Code  has  two  sections.  The  first  distinguishes  between 
felonies  and  misdemeanors  and  outlines  the  individual  citi- 
zen's responsibilities  under  the  law.  The  1988  constitution  pro- 
scribes capital  punishment,  except  in  case  of  war.  The  second 
section  defines  criminal  behavior  more  comprehensively,  spell- 
ing out  crimes  against  persons,  property,  custom,  public  wel- 
fare, and  public  trust.  Misdemeanors  are  also  defined. 

In  addition  to  the  power  arising  from  judicial  warrant, 
decree  laws  empower  the  police  to  make  arrests.  These  decree 
laws  provide  that  any  member  of  the  public  may,  and  the  police 
must,  arrest  anyone  found  in  flagrante  delicto.  The  privilege  of 
not  being  subject  to  arrest  unless  caught  in  the  act  of  commit- 
ing  a  crime  or  by  judicial  warrant  derives  from  the  1891  consti- 
tution and  has  been  included  in  subsequent  versions.  Article  5 
of  the  1988  constitution  states:  "No  one  shall  be  arrested 
except  in  the  act  of  committing  a  crime  or  by  written  and  sub- 
stantiated order  of  a  proper  judicial  authority."  It  states  further 
that  an  arrest  must  be  communicated  immediately  to  a  judge 
who,  if  he  or  she  finds  the  arrest  to  be  illegal,  must  order  the 
release  of  the  arrestee.  In  practice,  there  have  been  many  viola- 
tions of  the  constitutional  guarantees,  particularly  in  the  late 
1960s  and  early  1970s. 

The  process  of  bringing  violators  or  suspected  violators  of 
the  law  to  justice  usually  begins  in  one  of  three  ways.  The  first 
and  most  simple  occurs  in  cases  of  flagrante  delicto.  The  sec- 
ond method  is  followed  when  illegal  activity  is  uncovered  dur- 
ing routine  investigative  work,  after  which  a  judge  issues  a 
warrant  for  the  persons  involved  and  arrests  are  made.  The 
third  method  involves  complaints  from  private  citizens  that,  if 
borne  out  by  evidence  or  otherwise  deemed  reasonable,  result 
in  the  issuance  of  a  warrant. 

The  handling  of  arrestees  varies  according  to  the  nature  of 
the  crime,  the  nature  of  the  charges,  and  the  social  status  of 
the  accused.  An  arrestee  who  holds  a  university  degree  cannot 
be  held  in  a  cell  with  those  of  a  lower  educational  status,  but 
has  the  right  to  a  special  cell  and  privileged  treatment.  Felonies 
that  are  punishable  by  imprisonment  and  for  which  the 
arrestee  must  be  detained  require  thorough  investigation  fol- 
lowed by  trial  in  an  appropriate  court.  Offenses  punishable  by 
ordinary  confinement  of  thirty  days  or  less,  or  by  small  fines, 
usually  are  disposed  of  quickly  at  the  lowest  court  level  possi- 
ble. A  judge  may  direct  that  a  prisoner  be  held  in  custody  pend- 
ing a  preliminary  hearing,  or  the  judge  may  allow  bail 


405 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 


depending  on  the  severity  of  the  case.  Prisoners  may  also  be 
released  on  writs  of  habeas  corpus. 

According  to  law,  within  twenty-four  hours  of  arrest,  a  pris- 
oner must  be  given  a  copy  of  the  complaint,  signed  by  an 
authority  and  containing  not  only  the  details  of  the  charge  or 
charges  but  also  the  names  of  accusers  and  witnesses.  To  com- 
ply with  these  provisions,  the  police  immediately  must  initiate 
an  investigation;  they  must  visit  the  scene  of  the  incident,  col- 
lect available  evidence,  interrogate  witnesses,  and  compile  a 
coherent  account  of  what  actually  occurred.  This  information 
is  presented  as  a  police  report  to  a  judge,  who  then  sets  a  date 
for  a  hearing. 

The  first  step  in  the  legal  process  is  a  hearing,  popularly 
known  as  an  instruction  session,  to  identify  the  parties  involved 
and  to  determine  whether  a  punishable  offense  occurred. 
Except  for  misdemeanors,  the  instruction  session  is  not  a  trial 
but  rather  a  hearing  at  which  both  the  prosecution  and  the 
defense  are  heard  in  presentation,  rebuttal,  and  final  argu- 
ment. If  the  offense  is  a  misdemeanor,  the  judge  is  permitted 
to  turn  the  proceeding  into  a  summary  court  and  pronounce 
sentence.  If  the  case  involves  a  felony,  no  judgment  is  possible 
at  the  instruction  session.  If  the  judge  believes  that  there  is  evi- 
dence of  probable  guilt,  the  accused  is  indicted  and  a  trial  date 
is  set. 

There  are  constant  tensions  between  the  Civil  Police  and  the 
Military  Police  in  most  states,  and  sometimes  these  forces  get 
involved  in  shootouts.  The  Military  Police  are  under  the  juris- 
diction of  special  police  courts,  which  are  independent  of  ordi- 
nary courts.  The  courts  consist  of  five  judges — one  civilian  and 
four  ranking  Military  Police  officials.  Congressional  legislation 
that  would  place  the  Military  Police  under  ordinary  courts 
remained  stalled  in  1995. 

According  to  Country  Reports  on  Human  Rights  Practices  for 
1994,  "The  Military  Police  courts  .  .  .  are  overloaded,  seldom 
conduct  rigorous  investigations  of  fellow  officers,  and  rarely 
convict  them.  The  separate  system  of  state  Military  Police 
courts  creates  a  climate  of  impunity  for  police  elements 
involved  in  extrajudicial  killings  or  abuse  of  prisoners,  which  is 
the  single  largest  obstacle  to  altering  police  behavior  to  elimi- 
nate such  abuses."  Punishment  remains  the  exception  rather 
than  the  rule. 

Various  studies  have  supported  the  United  States  Depart- 
ment of  State's  conclusions.  One  study  of  police  crimes  against

civilians  in  the  Northeast,  between  1970  and  1991,  found  that 
only  8  percent  of  the  cases  resulted  in  convictions.  A  separate 
study  in  Sao  Paulo  found  that  only  5  percent  of  similar  crimes 
resulted  in  convictions. 

In  his  first  year  as  president,  Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso 
sought  to  address  some  of  the  human  rights  violations  in  Brazil 
by  unveiling  a  national  human  rights  plan  and  creating  a  divi- 
sion within  the  Federal  Police  tasked  with  investigating  human 
rights  abuses.  In  April  1995,  Cardoso  established  an  inter  minis- 
terial commission  to  address  the  problem  of  forced  labor.  In 
addition,  Cardoso  sought  to  compensate  the  families  of  those 
who  were  killed  by  state-sponsored  agents  during  military  rule. 
Separately  the  federal  Chamber  of  Deputies  created  a  Human 
Rights  Commission  within  the  Chamber  of  Deputies. 

The  1988  constitution  prohibits  arbitrary  arrest  or  deten- 
tion, limiting  arrests  to  those  caught  in  the  act  of  committing  a 
crime  and  those  arrested  by  order  of  a  judicial  authority.  Tem- 
porary detention  is  allowed  for  up  to  five  days,  under  excep- 
tional circumstances.  Judges  are  permitted  to  extend  that 
period.  In  practice,  police  sometimes  detain  street  youths  with- 
out judicial  authority. 

Penal  Institutions 

The  two  general  categories  of  penal  institutions  are  correc- 
tional and  detention.  The  first  category  includes  penitentia- 
ries, houses  of  custody  and  treatment,  penal  and  agricultural 
colonies,  and  houses  of  correction.  Of  Brazil's  approximately 
5,000  penal  institutions,  fifty-one  are  correctional  institutions, 
including  twenty-seven  penitentiaries,  six  houses  of  custody 
and  treatment,  twelve  agricultural  colonies,  and  six  houses  of 
correction.  The  second  category  includes  military  prisons, 
houses  of  detention,  and  juvenile  correctional  institutions. 

The  Federal  Prison  Department  (Departamento  Peniten- 
ciario  Nacional — Depen)  is  responsible  for  operating  the  penal 
system.  Depen  is  subordinate  to  the  National  Council  of  Crimi- 
nal and  Prison  Policy  (Conselho  Nacional  de  Politica  Criminal 
e  Penitenciaria — CNPCP),  which  is  under  the  Ministry  of  Jus- 
tice. Places  of  detention  include  twelve  military  prisons,  1,580 
prisons,  2,803  jails,  and  five  institutions  for  minors.  The  sepa- 
rate women's  penal  institutions  are  usually  operated  by  nuns. 
Prisoners  in  penitentiaries  are  assigned  to  work  units  in  main- 
tenance shops  and  in  light  industrial  plants  that  produce  and 
maintain  the  clothing  and  furnishings  used  in  the  institutions. 


408 


National  Security 


In  some  minimum  security  agricultural  colonies,  inmates  have 
their  families  live  with  them  during  their  incarceration. 

Prison  conditions  generally  range  from  poor  to  harsh,  and 
include  overcrowding,  a  lack  of  hygiene,  poor  nutrition,  and 
even  instances  of  torture.  In  1995  Brazil's  overcrowded  prisons 
held  129,169  inmates  in  space  designed  for  59,954.  That  com- 
pares with  23,385  inmates  in  1965,  nearly  a  sixfold  increase. 
Often  there  are  six  to  eight  prisoners  in  a  cell  meant  for  three. 
The  Ministry  of  Justice  reported  that  thirty-three  prison  rebel- 
lions occurred  in  1994,  while  attempted  or  successful  escapes 
averaged  almost  nine  per  day. 

Internal  security  in  Brazil  is  primarily  the  responsibility  of 
state  governments.  The  Federal  Police  play  only  a  minor  role 
and  are  limited  by  their  small  force.  The  largest  and  most 
important  State  Police  force  is  the  Military  Police,  whose  mem- 
bers are  uniformed  and  responsible  for  maintaining  order. 
They  also  serve  as  army  reserves.  The  Civil  Police  constitute  a 
much  smaller  force,  and  are  responsible  for  investigations. 

Toward  the  Future 

As  Brazil  looks  toward  the  future,  it  will  have  to  adjust  its 
national  security  policies  to  new  international  and  domestic 
conditions.  In  the  international  arena,  Brazil  probably  will  con- 
tinue its  integration  with  nations  in  the  Southern  Cone  of 
South  America  (especially  Argentina,  Paraguay,  and  Uruguay) 
and  the  rest  of  the  continent,  creating  new  linkages  and  reduc- 
ing any  perception  of  external  threat.  At  the  same  time,  there 
is  increasing  demand  for  Brazil's  participation  in  operations 
other  than  war,  such  as  peacekeeping.  Although  Brazil  has 
resisted  major  involvement  in  such  operations,  the  country's 
desire  for  greater  recognition  by  the  international  community 
(for  example,  a  seat  on  the  Security  Council  of  the  United 
Nations)  may  force  it  to  be  even  more  fully  involved. 

Democratic  rule  in  Brazil  is  being  consolidated.  The  return 
of  the  armed  forces  to  the  barracks  did  not  eliminate  them 
from  the  decision-making  process,  but  they  were  forced 
increasingly  to  share  power  with  civilians.  Unlike  their  counter- 
parts in  Argentina,  the  armed  forces  retained  some  of  their 
prerogatives.  And  yet,  as  Alfred  Stepan  concludes:  "It  is  clear 
that  the  attraction  of  military  rule — its  presumed  stability, 
unity,  and  fixity  of  purpose — has  been  largely  illusory.  Even 
more  importantly,  the  difficulties  encountered  by  the  highly 
professional  army  in  Brazil,  with  its  technocratic  civilian  allies, 


409 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

illustrate  that  there  can  be  no  apolitical  solution  to  the  prob- 
lems of  political  development." 

Major  issues  concerning  Brazil's  national  security  include 
the  revision  of  the  constitution,  the  role  of  intelligence,  protec- 
tion of  the  Amazon,  and  an  increasing  number  of  actors  in  the 
national  security  arena.  There  is  a  debate  over  whether  a 
revised  constitution  should  give  the  military  responsibility  for 
both  external  and  internal  defense,  as  was  granted  in  the  1988 
constitution.  Weak  political  institutions  in  Brazil  have  created  a 
vacuum  in  which  the  armed  forces  continue  to  play  a  some- 
what influential  political  role.  Although  the  military  has 
resisted  greater  involvement  in  civic-action  and  counterdrug 
activities,  it  may  have  little  choice  but  to  increase  its  involve- 
ment in  some  of  these  areas.  The  military's  dominant  role  in 
national  security  (especially  in  the  nuclear,  space  development, 
and  arms  industries)  may  be  eclipsed  by  an  expanding  roster  of 
actors.  It  remains  to  be  seen  how  the  military  will  respond  to  its 
displacement  by  civilian  actors  in  the  political  system. 

The  neoliberal  economic  model  introduced  by  Fernando 
Henrique  Cardoso  poses  major  challenges  for  those  involved 
with  national  security  issues  in  Brazil.  The  economic  model 
imposes  severe  financial  constraints  on  all  state-related  sectors, 
including  the  security  forces,  and  calls  into  question  the  size, 
roles,  and  missions  of  the  armed  forces.  By  late  1995,  the 
armed  forces  had  managed  to  curb  any  further  erosion  in 
defense  expenditures,  suggesting  that  the  impact  of  the  neolib- 
eral economic  model  on  the  military  would  not  be  as  severe  as 
in  Argentina.  The  economic  model,  with  its  emphasis  on  priva- 
tization, reduces  state  support  for  defense  and  other  industries 
previously  considered  "strategic."  The  privatization  of  Embraer, 
for  example,  symbolized  a  new  era  of  reduced  state  support  for 
defense-related  industries. 

Although  the  neoliberal  economic  model  has  reduced  the 
means  for  security  in  Brazil,  the  demand  for  security  has  not 
necessarily  declined.  On  the  external  front,  as  seen  above,  par- 
ticipation in  peacekeeping  continues  to  strain  resources.  On 
the  internal  front,  growing  criminality,  increased  drug  traffick- 
ing, and  similar  problems  also  strain  the  security  apparatus.  In 
conclusion,  the  need  to  balance  means  and  ends  in  the  security 
arena,  at  a  time  of  major  international  and  domestic  changes, 
will  challenge  Brazilian  policy-makers  into  the  twenty-first  cen- 
tury.

Comprehensive  coverage  of  the  subject  of  defense  in  Brazil 
is  contained  in  Adrian  J.  English's  two  books,  The  Armed  Forces  of 
Latin  America  and  Regional  Defence  Profile:  Latin  America,  both 
now  somewhat  dated.  For  a  study  of  Brazil's  defense  industry 
from  an  economist's  perspective,  see  Patrice  Franko-Jones,  The

concise  coverage  is  provided  by  Robert  J.  Branco's  The  United

economic  point  of  view,  and  by  Orlando  Bonturi's  Brazil  and  the

in  Brazil-United  States  military  relations,  including  Brazil's  par- 
ticipation in  the  Italian  campaign  of  World  War  II.  Hernani

In  the  case  of  the  individual  armed  forces,  the  history  of  the 
navy  is  better  documented  than  that  of  the  army  and  air  force, 
thanks  to  the  indefatigable  efforts  of  the  navy's  own  Historical 
Section.  Apart  from  the  navy's  publications,  Arthur  Oscar 
Saldanha  da  Gama's  two  books  on  the  Brazilian  Navy  in  the  two 
world  wars  provide  excellent  coverage  not  only  of  this  aspect  of 
the  subject  but  also  of  the  period  immediately  preceding  each 
conflict.  The  public  relations  departments  of  the  army  and  the

Brazilian  Air  Force  during  World  War  II,  merits  attention  for 
the  light  it  throws  on  the  early  development  of  Brazilian  mili- 
tary aviation,  the  impact  of  United  States  military  assistance,

anan  Wood  Carvings 


IN  THE  1970s,  BRAZIL  undertook  a  major  effort  to  establish  a 
strong  scientific  and  technological  base  that  would  make  the 
country  self-sufficient  economically,  powerful  militarily,  and 
better  able  to  withstand  international  pressures  and  con- 
straints. Heavy  investments  were  made  in  the  country's  infra- 
structure for  the  production  of  steel,  machine  tools,  energy, 
communications,  and  transportation.  A  few  high-technology 
projects  with  expected  civilian  spinoffs  were  started  in  atomic 
energy,  aeronautics,  and  space  research.  Universities  were 
reformed  along  the  so-called  United  States  model  of  graduate 
education  and  departmental  organization,  although  they  also 
retained  strong  European  characteristics  of  separate  faculties. 
Financing  agencies  for  science  and  technology  were  set  up  and 
endowed  generously.  Several  hundred  graduate  programs  were 
organized,  and  several  thousand  fellowships  were  awarded 
each  year  for  study  at  universities  in  the  United  States  and 
Europe.  Brazil's  effort  to  strengthen  its  scientific  base  attracted 
international  attention  and  was  considered  an  example  of  how 
a  country  might  move  from  underdevelopment,  poverty,  and 
international  dependency  to  economic  growth,  better  living 
standards,  and  self-reliance. 

During  the  1980s,  however,  Brazil's  fast-growing  economy 
lost  momentum  and  entered  a  period  of  stagnation.  The  invest- 
ments in  science  and  technology  of  the  previous  years  were 
insufficient  to  ward  off  the  forthcoming  debt  crisis  and  uncon- 
trolled inflation.  The  crisis  resulted  from  a  combination  of  fac- 
tors, including  the  outmoded  pattern  of  domestic  economic 
growth  through  import-substitution  industrialization  (see  Glos- 
sary), the  increase  in  international  interest  rates  and  oil  prices, 
and  the  uncontrolled  increase  in  public  expenditures  resulting 
from  decentralization  of  government  and  extensive  patronage. 
Key  questions  for  the  1990s  are  what  went  wrong,  and  how  the 
capabilities  created  in  the  1970s  can  best  be  used  to  regain  eco- 
nomic growth  and  improve  social  conditions  in  a  profoundly 
transformed  international  context. 

Modern  science  and  technology  are  products  of  Western  cul- 
ture and  tradition  and  are  not  transposed  easily  to  other  societ- 
ies and  cultures.  Nevertheless,  the  examples  of  Japan,  the 
Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea),  and  Taiwan  show  that  this 
transposition  is  possible.  A  comparison  between  Brazil  and  the 


415 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Asian  countries  points  to  important  differences  in  the  two 
experiences  and  possible  explanations  for  the  different  out- 
comes of  their  science  and  technology  policies. 

Science  and  technology  in  Western  Europe,  and  more 
recently  in  the  United  States,  developed  along  two  parallel  and 
mutually  reinforcing  lines:  as  part  of  a  broader  scientific  cul- 
ture, linked  to  education,  the  development  of  modern  profes- 
sions, and  a  growing  and  prestigious  scientific  community;  and 
as  part  of  the  increasingly  effective  industrial  and  military 
establishments.  The  term  science  is  usually  applied  to  the  first, 
while  technology  is  used  for  the  latter,  with  the  assumption  that 
they  are  two  sides  of  the  same  coin. 

The  Asian  countries,  however,  followed  a  strikingly  different 
path.  They  introduced  modern  technology  but  little  of  modern 
science  in  their  universities  and  other  similar  institutions;  and 
most  of  their  investments  in  technology  were  made  in  indus- 
trial firms,  rather  than  in  large,  isolated  governmental  agen- 
cies, including  the  military  sector.  Brazil,  by  contrast, 
developed  most  of  its  scientific  capabilities  in  universities,  while 
investments  in  technology  went  to  a  few  large-scale  govern- 
ment projects  under  the  military  and  to  a  handful  of  state- 
owned  corporations. 

The  assumption  in  Brazil  was  that  science  and  technology 
eventually  would  spill  over  from  higher  education  and  sophisti- 
cated technological  projects  into  society  as  a  whole.  In  practice, 
the  introduction  of  scientific  research  and  graduate  education 
in  universities  happened  at  a  time  of  rapid  expansion  of  higher 
education  enrollment,  leading  to  declining  quality  in  scholastic 
standards.  The  consequence  was  that,  while  a  handful  of  uni- 
versities and  departments  reached  levels  of  quality  similar  to 
those  in  the  developed  countries,  most  higher  education  insti- 
tutions, private  and  public,  lagged  behind.  In  technology  the 
large  military-based  projects  in  atomic  energy,  space  research, 
and  aeronautics  helped  in  the  development  of  a  few,  highly 
qualified  networks  of  local  suppliers  and  partners,  but  they  did 
not  enhance  the  quality  and  competence  of  the  industrial  sys- 
tem as  a  whole. 

In  the  early  1980s,  the  policy  of  technological  nationalism 
and  self-sufficiency  had  narrowed  to  the  computer  sector, 
where  protective  legislation  tried  to  shield  the  Brazilian  mini- 
and  microcomputer  industries  from  foreign  competition.  Here 
again,  the  policy  allowed  for  the  growth  of  local  industry  and  a 
few  well-qualified  firms,  but  the  effect  on  the  productive  capa- 


416 


Science  and  Technology 


bilities  of  the  economy  as  a  whole  was  negative;  and  the  inabil- 
ity to  follow  the  international  market  in  price  and  quality 
forced  the  policy  to  be  discontinued. 

There  are  other  features  found  in  the  Asian  countries  that 
did  not  exist  in  Brazil  and  that  help  to  explain  the  different 
outcomes  of  their  development  drives.  These  features  include 
an  emphasis  on  basic  and  secondary  education,  leading  to  a 
competent  and  well-educated  manpower  base;  lower  levels  of 
social  inequality,  thereby  strengthening  the  internal  market  for 
local  products;  a  sustained  effort  toward  international  competi- 
tiveness that  requires  high  levels  of  industrial  efficiency  and 
quality  control;  and  competent  and  powerful  public  bureaucra- 
cies working  in  close  association  with  a  few  large  and  well- 
endowed  private  firms. 

Historical  Evolution 

A  brief,  historical  sketch  explains  how  Brazil's  research  and 
development  institutions  were  shaped.  In  very  broad  terms, 
this  history  can  be  divided  into  seven  periods,  some  of  which 
overlap. 

Colonial  Science 

"Colonial  science"  covered  the  period  from  the  discovery  of 
Brazil  by  the  Portuguese  in  1500  until  the  beginning  of  the 
nineteenth  century.  Contrary  to  what  happened  in  many 
regions  of  Spanish  America,  the  Portuguese  did  not  bring  their 
universities  to  the  New  World.  Whatever  existed  in  terms  of  sci- 
entific research  in  those  years  was  done  by  European  explorers, 
who  incorporated  their  findings  in  the  European  collections  of 
natural  history.  Economic  activities  in  those  years  were 
restricted  to  the  production  of  sugar,  gold,  and  coffee;  slave 
labor  existed  almost  to  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  and 
work  tended  to  be  labor-  and  land-intensive  and  unskilled. 

Imperial  Science 

The  "imperial  science"  period  lasted  from  1808,  when  the 
seat  of  the  Portuguese  crown  moved  to  Rio  de  Janeiro  because 
of  the  Napoleonic  Wars,  until  the  beginning  of  the  republican 
period  in  1889.  The  first  higher  education  schools — a  military 
academy  in  Rio  de  Janeiro,  two  medical  schools,  and  two  law 
schools — were  created  in  the  first  years  of  the  "imperial  sci- 
ence" period,  and  a  few  scientific  institutions  started  to  appear. 


417 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

The  search  for  new  mineral  riches  and  the  effort  to  adapt  agri- 
cultural products  known  in  Europe  and  other  regions  to  Brazil 
led  to  the  creation  of  the  first  botanical  gardens  and  mineral- 
ogical  collections. 

Brazil  became  independent  formally  in  1822  and  enjoyed  a 
period  of  political  stability  between  1840  and  1889,  during  the 
reign  of  Emperor  Pedro  II  (1840-89).  New  scientific  institu- 
tions were  created  in  this  post-independence  period,  such  as 
the  Museum  of  Natural  History,  the  Astronomical  Observatory 
of  Rio  de  Janeiro,  and  the  Imperial  Geological  Commission. 
Foreign  scientists  were  invited  to  head  these  institutions,  and 
Pedro  II  himself  was  very  active  not  only  in  creating  Brazilian 
institutions  but  also  in  supporting  science  in  Europe.  The  kind 
of  science  being  developed  in  Brazil  in  those  years,  although 
similar  to  that  being  developed  in  Europe,  was  not  subject  to 
the  same  standards  of  quality  as  its  European  model.  The  main 
economic  activity  in  Brazil  was  the  production  of  coffee  for  the 
international  market,  based  on  slave  labor.  After  the  1850s, 
slave  labor  was  replaced  gradually  by  European  and  Japanese 
immigrants,  and  a  domestic  market  for  food,  textiles,  and 
other  basic  products  started  to  develop. 

Applied  Science  in  Agriculture  and  Health 

The  "applied  science  in  agriculture  and  health"  period  cov- 
ers the  first  decades  of  the  republic,  from  1889  to  the  mid- 
19308.  As  a  republic,  Brazil  became  more  decentralized.  The 
country's  economic  pole  shifted  gradually  to  Sao  Paulo  State — 
the  center  of  coffee  production  and  the  destination  of  massive 
European  immigration,  second  only  to  Buenos  Aires  in  Latin 
America.  Most  of  the  new  higher  education  and  research  insti- 
tutions in  those  years  were  created  in  the  city  of  Sao  Paulo. 
They  addressed  the  two  main  areas  of  concern  in  those  years: 
public  health,  particularly  the  sanitation  of  the  country's  main 
port  cities,  Santos  and  Rio  de  Janeiro;  and  agricultural 
research.  The  main  Sao  Paulo  State  institutions  from  those 
years  were  the  Agronomic  Institute  of  Campinas  (Instituto 
Agronomico  de  Campinas),  the  Biological  Institute  for  Animal 
Protection  (Instituto  Biologico  de  Defesa  Animal),  the  Butan- 
tan  Institute  (Instituto  Butantan)  for  snake-venom  research, 
the  Geological  Commission  of  Sao  Paulo  State  (Comissao 
Geologica  do  Estado  de  Sao  Paulo),  and  the  Vaccine  Institute 
(Instituto  Vacinogenico).  Also  during  this  period,  the  scientific 


418 


Science  and  Technology 


professions  expanded  and  tried  to  find  their  place  in  the  mod- 
ernization of  Brazilian  society. 

The  most  significant  scientific  institution  in  this  period,  how- 
ever, was  the  Manguinhos  Institute  (Instituto  Manguinhos), 
now  the  Oswaldo  Cruz  Foundation  (Fundacao  Oswaldo  Cruz) 
in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  This  institute  played  a  central  role  in  the 
control  of  tropical  diseases,  such  as  yellow  fever,  malaria,  and 
parasitic  diseases.  It  developed  important  research  lines  in  zoo- 
logical fields  such  as  helminthology  (worms)  and  entomology 
(insects),  and  its  researchers  were  the  first  to  identify  the  full 
etiology  of  Chagas'  disease.  The  Manguinhos  Institute  provided 
the  link  between  Brazilian  researchers  and  the  international 
scientific  community.  Most  of  Brazil's  leading  scientists  in 
human  biology,  public  health,  and  related  fields  were  trained 
there.  The  Manguinhos  Institute's  success  is  attributed  to  the 
ability  of  its  leadership  to  combine  a  clear  sense  of  short-term 
objectives  with  a  commitment  to  the  values  of  scholarship  and 
research. 

The  Search  for  Alternatives 

In  the  "search  for  alternatives"  period  in  the  1930s,  political 
centralization  and  the  first  attempt  to  provide  Brazil  with  mod- 
ern administrative,  military,  and  educational  institutions  took 
place.  The  main  initiatives  included  the  University  of  Sao  Paulo 
(Universidade  de  Sao  Paulo — USP),  which  was  created  in  1934 
as  the  country's  first  university.  Its  nucleus  was  a  School  of  Phi- 
losophy, Sciences,  and  Letters,  with  professors  coming  from 
France,  Italy,  Germany,  and  other  European  countries.  The 
USP  also  brought  together  several  research  and  higher  educa- 
tion institutions  in  the  state,  such  as  the  School  of  Medicine 
(Faculdade  de  Medicina),  the  Polytechnical  School  (Escola 
Politecnica),  and  the  School  of  Law  (Faculdade  de  Direito). 
(The  Polytechnical  School  includes  civil,  electrical,  mechani- 
cal, mining,  metallurgical,  naval  and  oceanographic,  and 
chemical  engineering  departments.)  The  USP  became  and  still 
is  Brazil's  main  academic  and  research  institution.  Along  the 
same  pattern,  a  national  university,  the  University  of  Brazil 
(Universidade  do  Brasil),  was  created  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1939. 
Today,  it  is  called  the  Federal  University  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  (Uni- 
versidade Federal  do  Rio  de  Janeiro — UFRJ).  A  third  university 
created  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1935,  the  University  of  the  Federal 
District  (Universidade  do  Distrito  Federal),  was  closed  down  by 
the  federal  government  a  few  years  later. 


419 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

This  model  of  institutional  modernization  was  also  applied 
to  the  rest  of  the  country.  Except  for  the  USP  and  a  few  sectors 
at  the  UFRJ,  however,  the  philosophy  schools  (Faculdades  de 
Filosofia)  functioned  as  teacher  colleges  and  conducted  little 
or  no  research.  The  traditional  professional  schools  remained 
independent  and  dedicated  to  their  traditional  degree-grant- 
ing activities. 

Deep  conceptual  differences  between  the  USP  and  the  Uni- 
versity of  Brazil  help  to  explain  the  different  institutional  devel- 
opment. The  Sao  Paulo  elites  created  the  USP  as  part  of  an 
emerging  tradition  of  cultural  enlightenment.  By  contrast,  the 
University  of  Brazil  was  the  product  of  a  centralized  and 
authoritarian  government,  under  the  direct  influence  of  the 
more  conservative  sectors  of  the  Roman  Catholic  Church. 

The  first  institutions  for  technological  research  were  created 
in  the  1930s.  They  included  the  National  Institute  of  Technol- 
ogy (Instituto  Nacional  de  Tecnologia — INT)  in  Rio  de  Janeiro 
and  the  Institute  for  Technological  Research  (Instituto  de  Pes- 
quisas  Tecnologicas — IPT)  in  Sao  Paulo.  They  were  supposed 
to  provide  technical  support  to  an  emerging  national  industry. 
The  INT  was  involved  in  the  first  studies  on  the  use  of  sugar 
cane  alcohol  for  engine  combustion  and  coal  from  Santa  Cata- 
rina  State  for  the  steel  industry. 

Economic  nationalism  became  dominant  by  the  end  of  the 
1930s.  The  1934  Code  of  Mines  declared  as  government  prop- 
erty all  resources  under  the  soil;  the  first  steel  plant,  the 
National  Iron  and  Steel  Company  (Companhia  Siderurgica 
Nacional — CSN),  was  established  in  Volta  Redonda  in  1942, 
with  United  States  support,  and  was  linked  to  Brazil's  entry  into 
World  War  II;  oil  exploration  became  a  state  monopoly,  and 
restrictions  were  placed  on  foreign  and  national  private  inter- 
ests. 

As  the  federal  administration  became  more  centralized  and 
bureaucratized,  some  of  its  research  institutions  suffered.  The 
Oswaldo  Cruz  Foundation  went  through  a  crisis  for  lack  of 
autonomy  and  support.  The  INT  gradually  turned  into  an 
agency  that  merely  provided  training  courses  for  the  public 
bureaucracy. 

Science  and  Technology  as  Modernization,  1945-64 

After  World  War  II,  it  was  generally  believed  that  Brazil  was 
becoming  a  modern,  industrial  society,  and  science  and  tech- 
nology were  to  be  important  components  of  this  trend.  Two

diverging  patterns  were  already  taking  shape  in  the  develop- 
ment of  science,  technology,  and  higher  education  in  Brazil, 
roughly  corresponding  to  the  broad  cleavage  in  Brazilian  soci- 
ety between  the  economic  and  political  centers  of  Sao  Paulo 
and  Rio  de  Janeiro.  The  first  was  more  entrepreneurial  and 
associative,  with  strong  civilian  institutions.  The  second  was 
more  hierarchical,  relying  on  the  civilian  and  military  bureau- 
cracies, and  was  linked  to  the  country's  poorer  regions  through 
patronage. 

Sao  Paulo  already  had  the  country's  main  university,  and 
after  World  War  II  the  Southeast  (Sudeste)  Region's  scientists 
organized  two  leading  institutions,  the  Brazilian  Society  for  Sci- 
entific Development  (Sociedade  Brasileira  para  o  Progresso  da 
Ciencia — SBPC)  and  the  Sao  Paulo  State  Federation  to  Sup- 
port Research  (Fundacao  de  Amparo  a  Pesquisa  do  Estado  de 
Sao  Paulo — FAPESP).  The  SBPC  became  Brazil's  main  volun- 
tary association  for  Brazilian  academics  and  has  been  very 
influential  in  voicing  the  scientific  community's  concerns  on 
national  issues,  such  as  protection  of  intellectual  freedom  in 
the  years  of  the  military  regime,  promotion  of  a  national  com- 
puter industry,  and  opposition  to  strict  patent  legislation.  The 
FAPESP  was  organized  as  a  very  efficient  and  respected  grant- 
giving  agency,  which  ran  according  to  strict  peer-review  proce- 
dures. It  received  about  1  percent  of  the  state  tax  revenues.  In 
addition  to  the  USP,  FAPESP,  IPT,  and  SBPC,  the  state  of  Sao 
Paulo  had  sixteen  other  research  institutes  linked  to  different 
branches  of  the  state  administration.  It  also  had  another 
research-oriented  university,  the  Campinas  State  University 
(Universidade  Estadual  de  Campinas— Unicamp),  and  a  state- 
wide university  devoted  to  professional  education,  Sao  Paulo 
State  University  (Universidade  Estadual  Paulista — Unesp). 

The  national  government,  meanwhile,  embarked  on  its  first 
attempt  to  muster  the  power  of  atomic  energy.  This  effort  was 
made  through  the  combined  creation  of  the  National  Research 
Council  (Conselho  Nacional  de  Pesquisas — CNPq),  now  called 
the  National  Council  for  Scientific  and  Technological  Develop- 
ment (Conselho  Nacional  de  Desenvolvimento  Cientffico  e 
Tecnologico — CNPq),  which  kept  the  traditional  acronym, 
CNPq;  the  National  Nuclear  Energy  Commission  (Comissao 
Nacional  de  Energia  Nuclear — CNEN);  and  the  Brazilian  Cen- 
ter for  Physics  Research  (Centro  Brasileiro  de  Pesquisas  Fisi- 
cas — CBPF).  Together,  these  three  institutions  were  supposed 
to  develop  the  full  cycle  from  the  production  of  nuclear  fuel  to 


422 


Science  and  Technology 


its  application  in  energy  generation,  and  eventually  the  tech- 
nology of  atomic  weaponry.  Beleaguered  by  limited  resources, 
lack  of  qualified  leadership,  and  international  pressures,  the 
atomic  energy  project  was  effectively  abandoned  at  the  end  of 
the  second  Getulio  Dorneles  Vargas  government  (president, 
1930-45,  1951-54)  in  1954.  The  CNPq  was  turned  into  a  small, 
underfunded,  grant-giving  agency.  After  its  reorganization  in 
the  1970s,  the  CNPq  absorbed  the  CBPF,  by  then  an  academic 
research  center,  as  one  of  its  institutes  (see  Nuclear  Programs, 
this  ch.). 

One  of  the  most  successful  institutes  of  the  1950s,  the  Aero- 
nautical Technology  Institute  (Instituto  Tecnologico  de 
Aeronautica — ITA),  was  placed  in  the  city  of  Sao  Jose  dos  Cam- 
pos, between  Rio  de  Janeiro  and  Sao  Paulo.  The  Brazilian  Air 
Force  (Forca  Aerea  Brasileira — FAB)  organized  the  ITA  with 
the  support  of  the  United  States  government,  working  in  close 
association  with  the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology. 
However,  the  ITA  was  not  restricted  to  military  students  and 
subjects;  it  became  Brazil's  leading  engineering  school,  recruit- 
ing students  from  all  over  the  country.  ITA  graduates  went  on 
to  occupy  central  positions  in  Brazil's  industries,  research  insti- 
tutions, and  main  science  and  technology  agencies.  The  ITA's 
research  branch,  the  Aerospace  Technical  Center  (Centro  Tec- 
nico  Aeroespacial — CTA),  became  the  basis  for  Brazil's  air- 
plane industry  and  made  Sao  Jose  dos  Campos  the  hub  of 
Brazil's  most  sophisticated  technological  industries.  What  was 
unique  about  the  ITA  was  this  combination  of  strong  govern- 
ment support,  qualified  institutional  leadership,  and  civilian 
orientation.  The  latter  gave  it  the  ability  to  tap  some  of  the  best 
talent  among  the  country's  researchers  and  students.  As  a 
result  of  the  military  governments  after  1964,  the  ITA  gradually 
lost  its  autonomy  and  civilian  character  and  entered  a  period  of 
decline. 

The  Great  Leap  Forward,  1968-79 

In  the  so-called  "great  leap  forward"  period,  the  Brazilian 
military  government,  which  took  power  in  1964,  embarked  on 
its  ambitious  program  of  scientific  and  technological  self-suffi- 
ciency. In  the  first  years,  the  military  government  entered  into 
conflict  with  a  significant  part  of  the  country's  scientific  leader- 
ship, because  of  the  latter's  real  or  assumed  socialist  stands. 
The  two  sides  later  reconciled,  however,  because  of  their 
shared  nationalism  and  concern  with  social  and  economic

development.  The  move  toward  scientific  self-sufficiency 
reached  its  climax  during  Ernesto  Geisel's  presidency  (1974- 
79),  which  scientist  Reinaldo  Guimaraes  describes  as  a  period 
of  "enlightened  despotism."  The  main  initiatives  in  this  period 
included  the  university  reform  in  1969  that  introduced  gradu- 
ate educadon  and  organized  the  universities  into  departments 
and  institutes. 

In  the  "great  leap  forward"  period,  science  and  technology 
became  linked  institutionally  to  the  economic  authorities.  The 
federal  government  created  support  agencies  and  programs 
under  a  newly  created  Planning  Ministry  or  the  Secretariat  of 
Planning  and  Coordination  of  the  Presidency  of  the  Republic 
(Secretaria  de  Planejamento  e  Coordenacao  da  Presidencia  da 
Republica — Seplan).  The  National  Bank  for  Economic  and 
Social  Development  (Banco  Nacional  de  Desenvolvimento 
Economico  e  Social — BNDES),  Brazil's  main  investment  bank, 
created  a  special  fund  for  science  and  technology,  which  led  to 
a  new  agency,  the  Funding  Authority  for  Studies  and  Projects 
(Financiadora  de  Estudos  e  Projetos — Finep).  The  Finep  was 
organized  as  a  private  corporation  under  ministerial  supervi- 
sion and  was  responsible  for  the  administration  of  the  National 
Fund  for  Scientific  and  Technological  Development  (Fundo 
Nacional  de  Desenvolvimento  Cientffico  e  Tecnologico — 
FNDCT),  which  has  provided  institutional  grants  for  techno- 
logical projects  for  research  and  development  in  public  and 
private  nonprofit  institutions.  The  FNDCT's  annual  budget  in 
the  mid-1970s  was  around  US$200  million  but  was  reduced 
gradually  to  about  US$40  million  by  the  early  1990s. 

The  1968-79  period  also  saw  the  establishment  of  two  large 
research  and  graduate  institutions  in  science  and  technology: 
the  Coordinating  Board  of  Postgraduate  Programs  in  Engi- 
neering (Coordenacao  dos  Programas  de  Pos-Graduacao  em 
Engenharia — Coppe)  at  both  the  UFRJ  and  Unicamp.  Both 
institutions  were  oriented  toward  research  and  training  in 
advanced  engineering  (chemical,  mechanical,  biomedical, 
electric,  metallurgical,  nuclear,  and  naval)  and  in  new  technol- 
ogies derived  from  recent  advances  in  solid-state  physics  and 
lasers.  Other  institutions  also  benefited,  such  as  the  Technol- 
ogy Center  (Centro  de  Tecnologia)  of  the  Pontifical  Catholic 
University  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  (Pontificia  Universidade  Catolica 
do  Rio  de  Janeiro — PUC-RJ),  the  Polytechnical  School  at  the 
USP,  and  the  ITA.  The  PUC  is  Brazil's  only  private  university 
that  produces  a  significant  amount  of  scientific  research.

Initiatives  in  the  1968-79  period  also  included  the  coopera- 
tion agreement  with  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West 
Germany)  for  the  development  of  nuclear  technology,  fol- 
lowed by  the  development  of  the  so-called  Parallel  Program 
(Programa  Paralelo),  a  secret  program  for  nuclear  weapons 
development;  the  beginning  of  the  space  program,  with  the 
development  of  a  satellite  launch  vehicle  and  a  satellite;  the 
development  of  a  subsonic  military  jet  aircraft  (the  AMX 
project,  in  association  with  Italy);  the  adoption  of  a  market  pro- 
tection policy  for  the  computer  industry;  and  the  writing  of 
three  successive  national  plans  for  scientific  and  technological 
development.  Another  initiative  included  the  creation  of 
research  and  development  centers  within  the  country's  main 
state-owned  corporations,  such  as  the  Brazilian  Petroleum  Cor- 
poration (Petroleo  Brasileiro — Petrobras),  Brazilian  Telecom- 
munications, Inc.  (Telecomunicoes  Brasileiras  S.A. — Telebras), 
and  the  Brazilian  Electric  Power  Company,  Inc.  (Centrais 
Eletricas  Brasileiras  S.A. — Eletrobras).  In  addition,  a  national 


425 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

system  for  agricultural  research  was  reorganized  and  strength- 
ened through  the  Brazilian  Agriculture  and  Livestock  Research 
Enterprise  (Empresa  Brasileira  de  Pesquisa  Agropecuaria — 
Embrapa),  under  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture. 

On  the  positive  side,  these  initiatives  were  characterized  by 
abundant  funding  resources,  quick-decision  mechanisms,  and 
some  relative  flexibility  in  the  use  of  the  grants.  Even  for  large 
projects,  resources  were  provided  whenever  possible  to  the 
group  leader,  in  a  deliberate  bypass  of  the  traditional,  cumber- 
some, and  ineffectual  procedures  of  public  administration.  On 
the  other  hand,  the  absence  of  well-defined  peer-review  proce- 
dures, particularly  at  Finep,  allowed  for  the  support  of  less  than 
worthy  groups  and  projects,  which  became  permanent  clients 
of  FNDCT  resources. 

More  serious  was  the  lack  of  consistency  that  existed 
between  science  and  technology  policies,  oriented  toward  self- 
sufficiency  and  a  strong  presence  of  the  public  sector,  and  the 
economic  policies  of  the  same  period,  which  opened  Brazil  to 
multinational  corporations  and  the  acquisition  of  ready-made, 
turnkey  technologies  from  abroad.  The  result  was  that  the 
research  seldom  benefited  the  productive  sector,  except  in 
three  main  areas:  in  agriculture,  mostly  through  the  develop- 
ment of  new  varieties  of  sugar  cane,  corn,  soybeans,  coffee, 
fruits,  and  other  crops;  in  a  few  sectors  where  government 
research  and  development  centers — such  as  the  Army  Technol- 
ogy Center  (Centro  Tecnologico  do  Exercito — CTEx),  the 
CTA,  and  those  of  Eletrobras,  Petrobras,  and  Telebras — linked 
with  industry  and  established  technical  standards  for  commu- 
nications equipment  and  other  products;  and  in  the  area  of 
computing,  where  the  government  tried  to  link  research  and 
production  by  Brazilian  private  firms  under  the  umbrella  of 
market  protection. 

Science  and  Technology  as  a  Pressure  Group,  1979-90 

In  the  "science  and  technology  as  a  pressure  group"  period, 
which  started  at  the  beginning  of  the  last  military  presidency  of 
Joao  Baptista  de  Oliveira  Figueiredo  (1979-85)  and  included 
the  first  civilian  government  of  Jose  Sarney  (1985-90),  the  pic- 
ture changed  completely.  The  Planning  and  Economy  minis- 
tries were  unified,  and  the  science  and  technology  sector  lost 
its  privileged  access  to  the  higher  echelons;  no  resources  were 
available  to  correspond  to  the  increasing  expectations  of  the 
previous  years;  scientists,  engineers,  and  public  employees  in 


426 


Science  and  Technology 


the  science  and  technology  sector  became  one  among  many 
different  interest  groups  competing  for  resources  from  a  gov- 
ernment concerned  only  with  its  political  survival  and  the 
administration  of  a  mounting  external  debt  and  inflation. 

The  Computer  Industry  Policy 

The  "informatics"  policy  started  in  the  late  1960s  and  early 
1970s  as  an  effort  to  develop  a  Brazilian  personal  computer 
(with  the  USP's  Engineering  School  working  on  hardware  and 
the  PUC-RJ  on  software,  and  with  support  from  the  navy  and 
the  Finep).  Technology  was  to  be  transferred  to  a  state-owned 
corporation,  Brazilian  Computers  and  Systems  (Computadores 
e  Sistemas  Brasileiros — Cobra),  and  to  private  firms  owned  by 
Brazilians.  With  the  development  of  personal  computers,  a  pol- 
icy was  devised  that  restricted  this  new  market  to  Brazilian 
firms  but  allowed  for  the  continuous  presence  of  multinational 
corporations,  particularly  in  the  area  of  mainframe  computers. 
Congress  approved  the  policy  in  1985.  The  central  tenet  of  the 
legislation  was  the  strict  ban,  for  seven  years,  on  the  import  of 
microcomputers  and  on  the  establishment  of  foreign  firms 
producing  microcomputers  and  software.  The  Computer  Tech- 
nology  Center  (Fundacao  Centro  Tecnologico  para 
Informatica — CTI)  was  established  in  1983  to  encourage  the 
development  of  scientific  and  technological  research  in  the 
computer  sector.  A  national  office  for  the  computer  industry, 
the  Special  Secretariat  for  Informatics  (Secretaria  Especial  de 
Informatica — SEI),  was  established  in  Brasilia.  It  had  the  power 
to  control  the  import  of  equipment  and  components,  to  set  tar- 
gets for  increasing  Brazilian  participation  in  joint  ventures  with 
foreign  firms  working  in  Brazil,  and  to  decide  about  govern- 
ment purchases  of  computer  equipment. 

The  policy  was  conceived  not  only  to  limit  the  small  com- 
puter market  to  national  firms  but  also  to  stimulate  the  local 
production  of  products  and  components,  which  was  part  of  a 
broader  policy  of  import  substitution.  Both  Brazilian  and  mul- 
tinational firms  were  required  to  increase  the  share  of  domes- 
tic content  in  their  products.  This  requirement  boosted  the 
development  of  local  competence  but  also  led  to  higher  costs 
and  a  loss  of  competitiveness,  given  the  lack  of  scale  in  the  local 
market.  This  strategy  of  mandatory  high  percentages  of  local 
components  in  all  items,  including  disk  drives  and  printers, 
contrasts  with  that  of  South  Korea,  for  example,  which  concen- 
trated on  a  few  components,  such  as  monitors,  where  the  local 


427 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

industry  could  compete  internationally  in  terms  of  quality  and 
price. 

To  protect  the  local  industry,  the  government  introduced 
mechanisms  to  prohibit  the  transfer  of  technologies  that  were 
similar  to  ones  being  developed  or  that  already  had  been  devel- 
oped by  Brazilian  companies.  This  policy  was  applied  to  both 
hardware  and  software,  and  Brazilian  firms  developed  emula- 
tors of  MS-DOS  and  Unix  computer  operating  systems  for  the 
local  industry.  As  a  result,  companies  that  could  bypass  this  leg- 
islation and  get  the  original  software  were  in  a  better  position 
than  those  that  remained  attached  to  much  less  advanced  local 
products. 

This  protectionist  policy  was  very  controversial  and  drew 
strong  opposition  from  the  United  States  government  and  mul- 
tinational firms,  in  the  name  of  free  trade.  It  also  drew  opposi- 
tion from  Brazilian  firms  and  corporations  that  thought  their 
access  to  high  technology  had  been  curtailed.  Supporters 
argued  that  the  policy  generated  technological  competence  in 
Brazilian  firms  and  created  employment  for  researchers  and 
engineers  at  little  cost  to  industry  or  Brazil.  Detractors  argued 
that  the  whole  industrial  sector  suffered  from  restrictions  on 
access  to  state-of-the-art  electronics  and,  more  generally,  that 
Brazil  was  delayed  in  entering  the  microcomputer  culture.  In 
practice,  the  civilian  government  under  Sarney  did  not  invest 
in  research  and  development  for  the  computer  industry,  and  a 
large  part  of  that  industry  remained  limited  to  the  assemblage 
of  microcomputers  with  imported  components.  A  few  firms 
have  specialized  in  some  market  niches  (such  as  bank  automa- 
tion) and,  after  1992,  entered  into  associations  with  multina- 
tional corporations  for  the  development  and  distribution  of 
international  microcomputer  brands  in  Brazil. 

Science  for  Industrial  Competitiveness 

The  World  Bank  (see  Glossary)  approved  a  US$72  million 
sector  loan  in  1985  (with  another  US$107  million  to  be  pro- 
vided by  the  Brazilian  government)  to  increase  the  country's 
competence  in  selected  areas  of  science  and  technology.  The 
underlying  assumption  had  been  that  the  government  would 
maintain  the  historical  levels  of  expenditures  for  the  sector  as  a 
whole.  This  expectation  was  not  fulfilled,  and  the  World  Bank's 
program,  called  the  Program  in  Support  of  Scientific  and  Tech- 
nological Development  (Programa  de  Apoio  ao  Desenvolvi- 
mento  Cientifico  e  Tecnologico — PADGT),  became  one  of  the 


428 


Science  and  Technology 


few  sources  of  support  for  scientific  research,  although  it  did 
not  contribute  directly  to  an  improvement  in  Brazil's  industrial 
competitiveness. 

The  brief  Fernando  Collor  de  Mello  presidency  (1990-92) 
called  for  making  science  and  technology  more  directly  rele- 
vant to  industrial  effectiveness,  in  an  economy  that  was  being 
deregulated  and  subjected  to  international  competition.  It  was 
also  a  period  of  high  inflation,  economic  depression,  and  polit- 
ical crisis.  The  main  initiatives  and  proposals,  some  dating 
from  the  previous  years,  included  the  continuation  of  the 
World  Bank  sector  loan  to  science  and  technology;  the  trans- 
formation of  Finep  into  an  agency  concerned  almost  exclu- 
sively with  loans  for  the  development  of  industrial  technology; 
a  sharp  reduction  in  the  FNDCT's  budget;  the  end  of  market 
protection  for  the  Brazilian  computer  industry;  major  reduc- 
tions in  the  resources  available  to  the  GNPq,  which  became 
restricted  to  the  administration  of  fellowships;  proposals  to  cre- 
ate strong  links  between  universities  and  the  productive  sector 
through  "technological  parks"  and  other  mechanisms  of  uni- 
versity-industry cooperation;  the  closing  down,  phasing  out,  or 
revising  of  large  military  projects,  such  as  the  Parallel  Program 
and  the  space  program;  and  the  privatization  of  most  publicly 
owned  corporations. 

Several  measures  related  to  the  opening  of  Brazil's  economy 
were  carried  out  and  are  still  in  effect.  However,  little  progress 
was  made  in  turning  the  science  and  technology  sector  in  new 
directions.  Economic  depression  limited  industrial  invest- 
ments, while  inflation  channeled  available  resources  to  the 
financial  markets.  The  scientific  community  viewed  the  Collor 
government  with  distrust. 

The  Itamar  Franco  government  (1992-94),  which  succeeded 
Collor  de  Mello  after  his  impeachment  on  corruption  charges, 
was  unable  to  overcome  the  country's  runaway  inflation  until 
mid-1994  and  did  not  have  a  chance  to  devise  a  science  and 
technology  policy.  The  minister  of  science  and  technology,  Jose 
Israel  Vargas,  an  internationally  respected  physicist  with  consid- 
erable credibility  in  Brazil,  worked  to  keep  the  issues  of  science 
and  technology  high  on  the  government  agenda.  He  sought  to 
pass  legislation  that  would  create  incentives  for  technology 
investments  in  industry  and  that  would  revive  Brazil's  space 
program.  In  addition,  he  was  committed  to  ensuring  the  bare 
minimum  of  resources  for  the  daily  activities  of  the  govern- 


429 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

merit's  main  science  and  technology  agencies.  No  long-term 
policy  seemed  to  exist,  however. 

Administration  of  Science  and  Technology 

The  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology 

The  central  agency  for  science  and  technology  in  Brazil  is 
the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  which  includes  the 
CNPq  and  Finep.  This  ministry  also  has  direct  supervision  over 
the  National  Institute  of  Space  Research  (Instituto  Nacional  de 
Pesquisas  Espaciais — INPE),  the  National  Institute  of  Amazon 
Region  Research  (Instituto  Nacional  de  Pesquisas  da 
Amazonia — INPA),  and  the  National  Institute  of  Technology 
(Instituto  Nacional  de  Tecnologia — INT).  The  ministry  is  also 
responsible  for  the  Secretariat  for  Computer  and  Automation 
Policy  (Secretaria  de  Politica  de  Informatica  e  Automacao — 
SPIA),  which  is  the  successor  of  the  SEI  (see  fig.  18). 

The  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  which  the  Sarney 
government  created  in  March  1985,  was  headed  initially  by  a 
person  associated  with  the  nationalist  ideologies  of  the  past. 
Although  the  new  minister  was  able  to  raise  the  budget  for  the 
science  and  technology  sector,  he  remained  isolated  within  the 
government  and  had  no  influence  on  policy  making  for  the 
economy.  In  addition,  inflation  brought  the  science  and  tech- 
nology budget  to  extremely  low  levels. 

With  the  new  ministry,  the  science  and  technology  agencies 
increased  in  size  but  lost  some  of  their  former  independence 
and  flexibility,  and  they  became  more  susceptible  to  patronage 
politics.  Most  of  the  resources  of  the  CNPq  were  channeled  to 
fellowship  programs  that  had  no  clear  procedures  for  quality 
control  and  no  mechanisms  to  make  the  fellows  active  in  the 
country's  science  and  technology  institutions.  New  groups 
competed  for  resources  and  control  of  the  country's  agencies 
of  science,  technology,  and  higher  education.  These  groups 
included  political  parties,  unionized  university  professors  and 
employees,  scientific  societies,  and  special  interest  groups 
within  the  scientific  and  technological  community.  The  SBPC 
(Brazilian  Society  for  Scientific  Development)  shed  its  image  as 
a  semi-autonomous  association  of  scientists  to  become  an  active 
lobbyist  for  more  public  resources  and  the  protection  of 
national  technology  from  international  competition.

National  Council  for  Scientific  and  Technological  Develop- 
ment 

The  National  Council  for  Scientific  and  Technological 
Development  (Conselho  Nacional  de  Desenvolvimento  Cienti- 
fico  e  Tecologico — CNPq)  is  a  complex  structure  with  about 
2,500  employees.  It  runs  an  extensive  program  of  fellowships 
and  research  grants;  several  special  programs,  such  as  the 
National  Program  for  Human  Resource  Training  for  Techno- 
logical Development  (Programa  Nacional  de  Capacitacao  de 
Recursos  Humanos  para  o  Desenvolvimento  Tecnologico — 
RHAE)  and  the  Program  for  Competitiveness  and  Technologi- 
cal Diffusion  (Programa  de  Apoio  a  Competividade  e  Difusao 
Tecnologica — PCDT) ;  and  integrated  programs,  such  as  those 
on  endemic  diseases,  virology,  genetics,  agricultural  develop- 
ment, and  humid  and  semiarid  tropical  regions.  Fellowships 
and  research  grants  are  provided  under  peer-review  evalua- 
tions, whereas  most  of  the  resources  for  the  special  programs, 
when  available,  are  managed  directly  by  the  administration. 

The  CNPq  also  has  several  research  institutes  of  its  own: 
those  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  include  the  Brazilian  Center  for  Physics 
Research  (Centro  Brasileiro  de  Pesquisas  Ffsicas — CBPF),  the 
Mineral  Technology  Center  (Centro  de  Tecnologia  Mineral — 
Cetem),  the  Institute  of  Pure  and  Applied  Mathematics  (Insti- 
tuto  de  Matematica  Pura  e  Aplicada — IMPA),  the  National 
Observatory  (Observatorio  Nacional — ON),  the  Museum  of 
Astronomy  and  Related  Sciences  (Museu  de  Astronomia  e 
Ciencias  Afins — MAST),  and  the  National  Computer  Science 
Laboratory  (Laboratorio  Nacional  de  Computacao  Cientf- 
fica — LNCC).  Others  include  the  Brazilian  Institute  of  Scien- 
tific and  Technological  Information  (Instituto  Brasileiro  de 
Informacao  em  Ciencia  e  Tecnologia — IBICT)  in  Brasilia,  the 
National  Astrophysics  Laboratory  (Laboratorio  Nacional  de 
Astrofisica — LNA)  in  Itajuba  (Minas  Gerais),  the  Emflio  Goeldi 
Museum  of  Para  (Museu  Paraense  Emflio  Goeldi — MPEG)  in 
Belem,  and  the  National  Syncrotron  Light  Laboratory  (Labo- 
ratorio Nacional  de  Luz  Sfncrotron — LNLS)  in  Campinas. 
These  institutes  vary  in  quality  and  size,  and  many  of  them  have 
their  own  graduate  education  programs.  The  minister  of  sci- 
ence and  technology  appoints  the  president  and  directors  of 
the  CNPq,  and  a  twenty-member  Deliberative  Council  (Con- 
selho Deliberativo),  which  includes  numerous  scientists,  super- 
vises it.

Science  and  Technology 


The  activities  of  the  CNPq  are  divided  formally  into  fellow- 
ships and  grants,  research,  information,  and  dissemination 
activities.  The  CNPq  spent  about  US$350  million  in  all  its  activ- 
ities in  1990,  and  US$371  million  in  1991.  About  70  percent  of 
the  total  is  used  for  development,  10  percent  for  research,  and 
20  percent  for  administrative  and  other  expenses.  Eighty-one 
percent  of  development  funds  go  to  fellowships.  Most  of  the 
fellowships  are  given  to  a  small  number  of  undergraduate  and 
M.A.-degree  students,  reflecting  the  limited  demand  that  exists 
for  advanced  degrees  (see  table  32,  Appendix). 

The  Funding  Authority  for  Studies  and  Projects 

The  second  main  agency  in  the  Ministry  of  Science  and 
Technology  is  the  Funding  Authority  for  Studies  and  Projects 
(Financiadora  de  Estudos  e  Projetos — Finep).  The  minister  of 
science  and  technology  appoints  the  president  and  directors  of 
the  Finep,  without  any  external  peer  review.  The  Finep  tradi- 
tionally has  worked  along  two  different  lines:  it  administers  the 
FNDCT,  and  it  serves  as  a  specialized  bank  that  makes  loans  to 
the  private  sector  for  technological  development  and  innova- 
tion. In  practice,  the  Finep's  activity  in  the  early  1990s  was  lim- 
ited mostly  to  loan  contracts  for  research  and  development 
projects  in  industry.  However,  because  of  the  economic  reces- 
sion and  market  interest  rates,  there  were  few  takers  (see  table 
33,  Appendix). 

The  Coordination  of  High-Level  Personnel  Training 

Another  important  agency  involved  in  science  and  technol- 
ogy is  the  Council  for  Advanced  Professional  Training 
(Fundacao  Coordenacao  de  Aperfeicoamento  de  Pessoal  de 
Nivel  Superior — CAPES)  at  the  Ministry  of  Education.  The 
CAPES  provides  fellowships  for  graduate  education  in  Brazil 
and  abroad  and  for  several  years  has  run  a  peer-reviewed  evalu- 
ation system  for  the  country's  graduate  programs.  The  fellow- 
ship program  is  divided  into  two  parts:  one  responds  to 
individual  applications  and  the  other  to  the  Faculty  Improve- 
ment Integrated  Program  (Programa  Integrado  de  Capaci- 
tacao  de  Docentes — PICD)  (see  table  34,  Appendix).  The 
GAPES  also  has  administered  some  FNDCT  grants. 

Other  Activities  by  the  Federal  Government 

Together,  the  CNPq,  CAPES,  and  Finep  are  responsible  for 


433 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

the  administration  of  the  World  Bank-supported  PADCT  pro- 
gram, under  the  coordination  of  the  Ministry  of  Sciene  and 
Technology.  Generally,  the  agencies  under  the  ministry  do  not 
handle  more  than  a  third  of  the  country's  total  science  and 
technology  federal  budget,  with  another  third  going  to  projects 
in  the  military  sector  (see  table  35,  Appendix).  Another  major 
agency  is  the  Brazilian  Agriculture  and  Livestock  Research 
Enterprise  (Embrapa),  which  has  a  budget  equivalent  to  that  of 
the  CNPq.  The  traditional  Oswaldo  Cruz  Foundation  in  Rio  de 
Janeiro  remains  an  important  research  institution  in  public 
health  and  related  fields. 

Science  and  Technology  in  the  States 

State  budgets  allotted  about  US$300  million  for  science  and 
technology  in  1991,  with  the  state  of  Sao  Paulo  accounting  for 
40  percent  of  spending,  and  the  states  of  Minas  Gerais,  Rio  de 
Janeiro,  and  Bahia  accounting  for  35  percent.  After  1988  most 
Brazilian  states  established  in  their  constitutions  a  fixed  per- 
centage of  their  budgets  to  be  given  to  the  state-level  science 
and  technology  sector.  They  followed  the  example  of  Sao 
Paulo,  which  provides  the  FAPESP  (Sao  Paulo  State  Federation 
to  Support  Research)  with  about  1  percent  of  state  tax  reve- 
nues (this  amounted  to  about  US$60  million  in  1991).  How- 
ever, Sao  Paulo  is  the  only  state  where  the  constitutional  rule  is 
followed  strictly. 

The  Sao  Paulo  Science  and  Technology  System 

The  FAPESP  is  just  one  part  of  a  large  science,  technology, 
and  higher  education  sector  run  by  the  state  of  Sao  Paulo  that 
includes  three  public  universities  and  several  research  insti- 
tutes. These  activities  are  coordinated  by  the  state  Secretariat 
for  Science,  Technology,  and  Economic  Development  (Secre- 
taria  de  Ciencia,  Tecnologia  e  Desenvolvimento  Economico — 
SCTDE).  However,  most  of  the  institutions  under  the  SCTDE — 
the  three  universities,  the  FAPESP,  and  the  IPT  (Institute  for 
Technological  Research) — are  autonomous.  The  Institute  for 
Nuclear  and  Energy  Research  (Instituto  de  Pesquisas  Energeti- 
cas  e  Nucleares — IPEN),  located  on  the  USP  campus,  is  also 
linked  formally  to  the  SCTDE  but  in  practice  is  run  by  the  fede- 
ral government.  The  SCTDE  also  runs  the  State  Foundation 
for  Scientific  and  Technological  Development  (Fundo  Estad- 
ual  de  Desenvolvimento  Cientifico  e  Tecnologico — Funcet), 
which  provides  loans  to  the  private  sector,  cooperatives,  and 


434 


Science  and  Technology 


associations,  in  collaboration  with  the  Sao  Paulo  State  Bank 
(Banco  do  Estado  de  Sao  Paulo — Banespa) .  Funcet  has  a  bud- 
get of  about  US$20  million  and  a  grant  program  through  its 
Department  of  Science  and  Technology  (Departamento  de 
Ciencia  e  Tecnologia — DCET)  (see  table  36,  Appendix). 

Research  and  Development 

A  comparison  between  science  in  Brazil  and  science  in  other 
Latin  American  countries  and  in  Israel  helps  to  place  Brazilian 
scientific  research  in  a  broader  context.  According  to  a  1994 
study  prepared  by  scientist  Thomas  S.  Shott,  Brazil  performs 
less  than  1  percent  of  the  scientific  research  in  the  world.  No 
Brazilian  scientist  was  mentioned  in  a  survey  that  cited  nearly 
3,000  scientists  as  principal  contributors  or  as  influential.  Bra- 
zilian research  amounted  to  a  little  less  than  half  the  research 
performed  in  Latin  America  and  about  a  third  of  that  per- 
formed in  Israel,  where  scientific  performance  is  high. 

In  economy  and  population,  Brazil  is  roughly  half  the  size  of 
the  rest  of  Latin  America.  However,  Brazil  is  a  whole  order  of 
magnitude  larger  than  Israel  in  terms  of  the  economy  and  even 
more  in  terms  of  population,  and  yet  far  less  research  is  per- 
formed in  Brazil  than  in  Israel.  Brazilian  specialization  empha- 
sizes the  disciplines  of  physics,  biology,  and  mathematics. 
Brazilian  research  focuses  on  biomedicine  and  earth  and  space 
science  and  de-emphasizes  clinical  medicine  and  chemistry. 
Within  medicine,  however,  tropical  medicine  and  parasitology 
are  fields  of  strong  specialization  in  Brazil,  as  in  the  rest  of 
Latin  America.  Brazilian  growth  has  been  highest  in  technolog- 
ical science,  especially  in  computing. 

Brazilian  scientists  are  tied  to  colleagues,  both  Brazilian  and 
foreign,  who  have  influenced  their  research  and  who  are  col- 
laborators or  competitors  in  research.  Cooperation  and  collab- 
oration between  Brazilian  researchers  and  the  scientific 
establishment  in  the  rest  of  Latin  America  are  also  higher. 
Additional  factors  promoting  scientific  ties  are  social  and  cul- 
tural linkages  between  Brazil  and  the  rest  of  Latin  America. 

Although  regional  integration  is  noticeable,  it  is  overshad- 
owed by  the  influence  of  scientific  centers  in  North  America 
and  Western  Europe.  Brazilian  scientists  value  their  visits  to 
these  centers.  The  involvement  of  Brazilian  scientists  with  the 
centers,  however,  has  been  slightly  less  than  the  participation 
of  other  Latin  American  scientists  and  much  less  than  that  of 
Israeli  scientists.

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

University  Research  and  Graduate  Education 

Most  of  Brazil's  research  and  development  activities  take 
place  in  its  main  public  universities.  There  are  about  1.5  mil- 
lion higher  education  students,  around  10  percent  of  the  age 
cohort,  distributed  in  federal  (21.1  percent),  state  (12.7  per- 
cent), municipal  (5.1  percent),  and  private  institutions  (61.1 
percent).  There  are  about  15,000  active  scientists  and  research- 
ers in  Brazil,  and  about  1,000  graduate  programs  in  most  fields 
of  knowledge. 

Research  in  universities  usually  is  associated  with  graduate 
education,  although  relatively  few  university  professors  hold  a 
doctoral  degree.  These  professors  are  concentrated  in  the  Sao 
Paulo  State  system,  which  is  responsible  for  more  than  50  per- 
cent of  the  doctoral  degrees  granted,  and  in  some  of  the  best 
federal  universities  (see  table  37,  Appendix). 

Most  academics  in  public  institutions  have  full-time  con- 
tracts, and  their  salaries  are  equivalent  to  those  obtained  in  pri- 
vate schools.  The  assumption  is  that  they  should  combine 
teaching  with  research,  but  in  practice  few  have  the  necessary 
training  for  research  work.  The  universities  provide  physical 
space  and  salaries  for  research,  but  little  else;  the  researcher,  or 
the  research  group,  has  to  seek  out  support  money  and 
research  grants.  In  most  cases,  the  researcher  applies  for  grants 
from  the  CNPq  and  FAPESP  or  from  some  private  foundation 
in  Brazil  or  abroad.  Equipment  and  library  holdings  in  the  uni- 
versities usually  are  obtained  through  special  grants  and 
projects  from  Finep  or  from  occasional  programs  run  by  the 
government,  in  some  cases  with  resources  from  the  World 
Bank  or  the  Inter-American  Development  Bank  (see  Glossary) . 
Researchers  can  also  enter  into  cooperative  research  projects 
with  public  and  private  corporations,  or  with  the  government 
itself.  Unicamp  (Campinas  State  University),  for  instance,  had 
an  important  cooperative  agreement  with  Telebras,  Brazil's 
communications  holding;  and  the  Goppe  (Coordinating  Board 
of  Postgraduate  Programs  in  Engineering)  has  worked  with 
Petrobras  in  the  development  of  technologies  for  deep-sea  oil 
drilling.  The  Federal  University  of  Santa  Catarina  is  well  known 
for  its  Institute  of  Mechanical  Engineering  (Instituto  de  Engen- 
haria  Mecanica — IEM)  and  has  a  large  portfolio  of  research 
and  development  contracts  with  private  institutions.  The  more 
entrepreneurial  and  competent  departments  and  institutes 
obtain  resources  that  enable  them  to  work  according  to  high 
standards  of  efficiency.  Others,  in  the  same  institution,  may  not 


436 


Science  and  Technology 


have  the  means  to  purchase  a  computer  or  even  to  renew  jour- 
nal subscriptions. 

Research  in  State-Owned  Corporations 

About  10  percent  of  the  public  investments  in  research  and 
development  in  Brazil  are  made  by  a  small  group  of  state- 
owned  corporations  and  holdings  in  the  fields  of  telecommuni- 
cations, oil,  electric  energy,  mining,  metallurgy,  and  aeronau- 
tics. Several  of  these  corporations  have  created  their  own 
research  and  development  centers,  the  best  known  being 
Petrobras's  Research  and  Development  Center  (Centro  de  Pes- 
quisa  e  Desenvolvimento — Cenpes),  Telebras's  Research  and 
Development  Center  (Centro  de  Pesquisa  e  Desenvolvi- 
mento— CPqD),  Eletrobras's  Electric  Power  Research  Center 
(Centro  de  Pesquisas  de  Energia  Eletrica — Cepel),  the  Tech- 
nology Center  (Centro  de  Tecnologia)  of  the  Rio  Doce  Valley 
Company  (Companhia  Vale  do  Rio  Doce — CVRD),  and  the 
CTA  (Aerospace  Technical  Center),  associated  with  the  Brazil- 
ian Aeronautics  Company  (Empresa  Brasileira  Aeronautica — 
Embraer),  the  state-owned  aircraft  manufacturer. 

At  their  best,  these  research  centers  are  linked  with  the  com- 
panies' suppliers  and  are  responsible  for  establishing  standards 
of  quality  and  providing  technical  know-how.  They  also  com- 
municate with  other  research  and  development  groups  in  gov- 
ernment and  universities  in  order  to  exchange  ideas  and 
information  and  bolster  professional  competence.  These 
research  centers  played  important  roles  in  the  1970s  and  early 
1980s.  They  saved  foreign  currency  that  would  have  been  spent 
on  technical  assistance  and  royalties,  improved  their  compa- 
nies' operational  capabilities,  better  utilized  Brazil's  natural 
resources,  strengthened  the  private  sector's  competence,  and 
provided  resources  to  universities  through  research  contracts 
and  programs  of  technical  assistance  and  training. 

The  oldest  and  largest  of  these  centers  is  Cenpes,  which, 
under  different  names,  has  existed  since  the  creation  of  Petro- 
bras  in  the  mid-1950s.  Cenpes's  most  significant  achievement 
was  the  development  of  state-of-the-art  technologies  for  deep- 
sea  oil  drilling,  in  association  with  Coppe  at  the  UFRJ  (Federal 
University  of  Rio  de  Janeiro)  and  several  other  Brazilian  uni- 
versities. Cenpes,  which  is  located  on  the  UFRJ  campus,  main- 
tains links  with  research  institutions  in  the  United  States, 
Britain,  and  other  countries  and  provides  research  services  for 
other  clients.  Nonetheless,  the  proportion  of  resources  spent 


437 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

by  Petrobras  on  research  and  development  is  significantly 
lower  than  the  international  average  for  large  oil  companies. 
In  1994  Cenpes  had  1,656  employees.  Its  annual  budget  has 
ranged  from  US$134.2  million  in  1987  to  US$102.7  million  in 
1991,  which  corresponds  to  a  figure  of  between  0.5  percent 
and  0.8  percent  of  Petrobras's  gross  revenues. 

Telebras's  research  center,  the  CPqD,  has  played  an  impor- 
tant role  in  setting  the  standards  for  Brazil's  telecommunica- 
tion systems.  Foreign  companies  in  Brazil  are  requested  to 
adopt  these  standards,  local  companies  receive  support  to  train 
personnel  and  to  develop  technological  competence,  and  the 
government  guarantees  the  purchase  of  products  that  meet 
Telebras's  standards.  The  consequence  has  been  the  creation 
of  several  dozens  firms  linked  to  the  Telebras  system  and  pro- 
tected from  competition.  The  CPqD's  budget  is  around  US$50 
million  a  year,  and  it  has  1,200  employees. 

These  research  centers  usually  are  much  better  endowed 
with  equipment,  staff,  and  resources  than  research  groups  in 
universities  and  academic  institutes.  However,  because  they  are 
shielded  from  outside  review  and  from  financial  constraints,  it 
is  uncertain  whether  their  performance  is  commensurate  with 
their  costs.  Because  of  economic  stagnation,  their  budgets  were 
reduced  in  the  late  1980s,  and  lower  salaries  led  to  the  loss  of 
their  best  researchers.  In  the  new  environment,  they  have  been 
compelled  to  redefine  their  functions  in  two  ways.  First,  they 
have  had  to  stay  much  closer  to  the  direct  operational  needs  of 
their  institutions  and  forsake  long-term  and  technologically 
more  ambitious  projects;  second,  they  have  had  to  look  for 
independent  sources  of  support,  whether  by  selling  their  ser- 
vices or  by  establishing  associations  with  the  private  sector  and 
other  research  and  development  institutions.  Privatization  has 
led  to  the  shutdown  of  some  of  these  research  groups,  as  hap- 
pened in  some  steel  companies. 

Technological  Research  in  the  Private  Sector 

Research  and  development  in  the  private  sector  in  Brazil 
take  place  among  companies  that  participate  in  the  interna- 
tional market  and  among  those  working  in  areas  where  the  gov- 
ernment has  required  or  supported  the  development  of  local 
technology.  "Required"  areas  include  telecommunications  and 
computers;  "supported"  areas  include  agriculture  and  military 
equipment.  In  addition,  a  few  companies  have  adopted 
medium-  and  long-term  strategies  based  on  technological  inno-

vation.  An  estimated  200  companies  have  significant  invest- 
ments in  research  and  development  in  Brazil.  In  1985,  1,241 
firms  were  on  record  as  having  declared  some  investment  in 
research  and  development,  totaling  about  US$300  million. 
These  firms  were  responsible  for  30  percent  of  the  total  reve- 
nues of  the  private  industrial  sector.  Detailed  surveys  have 
shown  that  only  0.5  percent  of  persons  with  Ph.D.  degrees  in 
the  country  work  in  the  private  sector,  that  few  firms  have 
defined  budgets  for  research  and  development,  and  that 
projects  tend  to  be  small  and  short-lived. 

Centers  of  Excellence 

Scientist  Jacques  Marcovitch  conducted  a  detailed  1992 
study,  entitled  Centers  of  Excellence  in  PeD  in  Brazil,  on  a  small 
group  of  high-quality  research  centers  in  an  attempt  to  identify 
the  reasons  for  their  success.  They  were  Petrobras's  Cenpes,  in 
Rio  de  Janeiro;  the  Institute  of  Mechanical  Engineering  of  the 
Federal  University  of  Santa  Catarina,  in  Florianopolis;  the 
Heart  Institute  (Instituto  do  Coracao)  at  USP;  the  Butantan 
Institute,  belonging  to  Sao  Paulo  State's  SCTDE;  IMPA  (Insti- 
tute of  Pure  and  Applied  Mathematics),  associated  with  the 
CNPq,  in  Rio  de  Janeiro;  the  research  center  of  Light  Metal, 


439 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Inc.  (Metal  Leve  S.A.),  a  leading  Brazilian  manufacturer  of  car 
and  airplane  components;  the  research  center  of  Rhodia-Pou- 
lenc,  a  French  chemical  industrial  group,  in  Paulinia,  Sao 
Paulo;  and  the  soybean  research  program  at  the  Federal  Uni- 
versity of  Vicosa,  Minas  Gerais. 

Despite  their  different  contexts  and  purposes,  all  these  cen- 
ters of  excellence — government  institutes,  university  research 
centers,  and  research  and  development  units  in  private  and 
public  corporations — shared  a  common  set  of  features.  First, 
they  benefited  from  their  external  environment,  including  the 
availability  of  financial  support,  different  types  of  incentives, 
market  niches,  or  well-identified  local  opportunities.  A  well- 
established  and  competent  leadership  identified  these  oppor- 
tunities and  put  them  to  proper  use.  Second,  they  made  world- 
class  contributions  in  their  fields  of  knowledge.  This  was  true 
even  for  IMPA,  which  works  in  the  most  abstract  fields  of  math- 
ematics but  still  has  an  important  impact  on  the  teaching  of 
mathematics  at  all  levels  in  Brazilian  education.  Third,  the 
leaderships  of  these  centers  shared  an  entrepreneurial  spirit. 
The  most  outstanding  researchers  or  institution-builders  all 
shared  the  ability  to  identify  successful  goals  for  their  institu- 
tion, to  garner  resources,  and  to  identify  talent.  Fourth,  the 
leaders  of  these  institutions  had  an  ability  to  find  a  proper 
organizational  model.  According  to  Marcovitch,  these  entre- 
preneurs found  innovative  mechanisms  that  freed  them  from 
bureaucratic  labyrinths,  and  they  adopted  institutional  frame- 
works that  supported  the  achievement  of  their  goals.  Constant 
organizational  adaptations,  specialized,  task-oriented  units, 
efficient  decision  making,  and  consensus  among  the  leaders 
and  the  researchers  were  key  features  of  success. 

These  conditions  of  success  also  help  to  explain  why  the  cen- 
ters of  excellence  are  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule 
among  Brazilian  research  institutions.  Most  research  centers  in 
universities  and  government  institutions  follow  civil  service 
rules,  which  favor  fixed  procedures  and  conformity  rather  than 
entrepreneurship  and  managerial  flexibility.  Protected  until 
recently  by  strong  trade  barriers  or  state  monopolies,  Brazilian 
companies  did  not  make  efficiency  and  innovation  their  priori- 
ties, and  either  did  not  invest  in  research  and  development  or 
did  not  use  products  derived  from  their  research  and  develop- 
ment units.  If  Brazilian  science  is  to  play  a  significant  role  in 
the  country's  future,  Brazil's  institutions  need  an  environment 
of  entrepreneurship,  quality,  and  institutional  flexibility  that  is 


440 


Science  and  Technology 


typical  of  its  centers  of  excellence.  Only  then  can  these  centers 
become  the  rule  rather  than  the  exception. 

Policy  Perspectives 

Brazil  has  developed  a  significant  infrastructure  for 
research,  development,  and  innovation.  Nevertheless  there  is  a 
clear  need  to  redirect  the  entire  science  and  technology  sector 
from  the  patterns  established  in  the  1970s  to  others  more  in 
line  with  the  realities  of  the  1990s.  This  new  pattern  should 
bring  this  sector  much  closer  to  the  educational  and  produc- 
tive sectors. 

The  fact  that  most  Brazilian  researchers  and  research 
projects  are  in  the  universities  does  not  mean  that  they  are  as 
involved  with  professional,  technical,  and  general  education. 
Areas  in  need  of  improvement  include  establishing  closer  links 
between  science  and  technology  and  the  productive  sector  and 
stimulating  the  private  sector  to  increase  its  share  of  the  coun- 
try's research  and  development  efforts.  Both  cases  require  mov- 
ing from  a  vertical  approach,  concerned  with  graduate 
education,  leading-edge  technology,  and  large  science  projects, 
to  a  more  horizontal  one,  aimed  at  increasing  the  general  level 
of  competence  of  the  population  and  the  productive  system  as 
a  whole.  This  change  in  emphasis  requires  that  the  institutions 
providing  support  and  incentives  to  science  also  be  changed. 
The  two  traditions  of  research  and  education  that  exist  in  Bra- 
zil— one  more  associative,  based  on  the  civil  society,  and  more 
entrepreneurial;  the  other  more  hierarchical,  centralized,  and 
bureaucratic — point  to  the  main  direction  of  change,  from  the 
second  to  the  first.  Research  groups  and  institutions  need  to 
increase  their  autonomy  and  flexibility.  There  is  also  a  need  for 
the  government  to  establish  general  guidelines  and  incentives 
and  for  its  policy  decisions  to  be  more  pragmatic,  ad  hoc,  and 
goal-oriented. 

Traditionally,  Brazil's  technological  community  has 
restricted  knowledge  to  a  few  sectors  rather  than  used  it  for  the 
benefit  of  the  whole  society.  The  Brazilian  science  and  technol- 
ogy sector  was  subject  to  an  extensive  review  in  1993.  Accord- 
ing to  the  main  conclusions  and  recommendations  of  the 
study,  which  was  published  in  1994  by  the  Getulio  Vargas  Foun- 
dation (Fundacao  Getulio  Vargas) ,  science  and  technology  are 
more  important  than  ever  for  Brazil.  If  the  country  is  to  raise 
living  standards,  consolidate  a  modern  economy,  and  partici- 
pate as  a  significant  partner  in  an  increasingly  integrated  and 


441 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

global  world,  the  economy  must  modernize  and  adjust  to  an 
internationally  competitive  environment.  Education  should  be 
expanded  and  improved  at  all  levels.  As  the  economy  grows 
and  new  technologies  are  introduced,  new  challenges  will 
emerge  in  the  production  and  use  of  energy,  environmental 
control,  public  health,  the  management  of  large  cities,  and 
changes  in  the  composition  of  the  labor  force.  Strong  indige- 
nous competence  will  be  necessary  for  Brazil  to  participate  as 
an  equal  in  international  negotiations  and  in  the  setting  of 
international  standards  that  may  have  important  economic  and 
social  consequences  for  Brazil. 

According  to  the  study,  any  new  science  and  technology  pol- 
icy should  stimulate  the  researcher's  initiative  and  creativity; 
establish  strong  links  between  the  researcher's  work  and  the 
requirements  of  the  economy,  the  educational  system,  and  soci- 
ety as  a  whole;  make  Brazilian  science  and  technology  truly 
international;  and  strengthen  the  country's  educational  and 
science  and  technology  capabilities.  To  fulfill  these  tasks,  Bra- 
zil's technology  policies  need  to  be  redirected  in  line  with  new 
economic  realities.  In  the  short  run,  policies  need  to  be  geared 
to  the  reorganization  and  technological  modernization  of  the 
industrial  sector.  Permanent  policies  need  to  be  established  to 
induce  the  more  dynamic  sectors  of  the  productive  system  to, 
as  a  main  priority,  enter  a  continuous  process  of  innovation 
and  incorporation  of  new  technologies  into  the  productive 
process  and  to  keep  in  step  with  technical  progress  in  the  world 
economy. 

The  study  also  concluded  that  research  groups  in  universi- 
ties and  government  institutes  should  be  strongly  encouraged 
to  link  to  the  productive  sector  and  to  engage  in  applied  work, 
while  maintaining  a  high  level  of  academic  and  basic  research 
activities.  The  resources  for  applied  work  should  not  come 
from  the  budget  for  basic  activities  but  from  specific  sources  in 
government  agencies,  special  programs,  private  firms,  and 
independent  foundations.  Applied  projects  need  to  be  evalu- 
ated in  terms  of  their  academic  quality,  as  well  as  their  eco- 
nomic viability  and  social  and  economic  significance. 

Globalization  requires  a  profound  rethinking  of  the  old 
debate  between  scientific  self-sufficiency  and  internationalism, 
which  are  not  necessarily  contradictory.  Brazil  has  much  to 
gain  as  it  increases  its  ability  to  participate  fully  as  a  respected 
partner  in  the  international  scientific  and  technological  com- 
munity. To  meet  this  objective,  fellowship  programs  of  the

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

CAPES  (Council  for  Advanced  Professional  Training)  and  of 
the  CNPq  for  studies  abroad  need  to  be  revised  and  expanded 
eventually.  Brazil  will  benefit  most  fully  from  a  studies-abroad 
program  by  awarding  fellowships  to  first-rate  students.  Provi- 
sions also  need  to  be  made  for  postdoctoral  programs  both 
abroad  and  in  Brazil  and  to  bring  top-quality  scholars  from 
other  countries  for  extended  periods,  or  even  permanent 
appointments,  in  Brazilian  university  and  research  institutions. 

The  channels  for  cooperation  among  Brazilians,  interna- 
tional agencies  and  institutions,  and  the  international  scientific 
community  need  to  be  expanded.  The  World  Bank,  the  Inter- 
American  Development  Bank,  and  the  United  Nations 
Development  Programme  (see  Glossary)  have  played  impor- 
tant roles  in  providing  resources  for  capital  investment, 
research  support,  or  the  development  of  Brazilian  institutions. 
This  support  provides  resources  as  well  as  international  exper- 
tise and  exposure.  One  possible  future  role  for  international 
agencies  might  be  to  stimulate  the  process  of  institutional 
reform. 

The  issues  of  protectionism  versus  market  competitiveness 
loom  large  in  Brazil's  relations  with  industrialized  countries.  In 
particular,  scientific  and  technological  developments  demon- 
strate a  need  to  emphasize  pragmatism  over  ideology.  Brazil's 
instruments  of  technological  and  industrial  policy  include  tax 
incentives,  tariff  protection,  patent  legislation,  government 
procurement,  and  long-term  investments  in  technological 
projects  in  association  with  the  private  sector.  All  of  these  serve 
a  useful  purpose,  but  adequate  patent  and  intellectual  property 
protection  remains  key  to  the  normalization  of  Brazil's  rela- 
tions with  the  industrialized  countries. 

New  and  systematic  means  to  incorporate  technology  into 
the  industrial  process  are  needed  to  emphasize  the  develop- 
ment and  dissemination  of  norms,  standards,  and  procedures 
for  technological  transfer  and  quality  improvement.  Easy 
access  of  scientists  to  libraries  and  databases  in  the  country  and 
abroad  can  ensure  a  well-organized  and  properly  funded  infor- 
mation infrastructure,  which  makes  use  of  the  latest  technolo- 
gies in  electronic  communication  and  networking.  New 
technologies  and  competencies  developed  elsewhere  have 
underscored  the  need  to  reevaluate  the  role  of  the  CNPq's 
IBICT  (Brazilian  Institute  of  Scientific  and  Technological 
Information).

Nuclear  Programs 

Brazil's  nuclear  capabilities  are  the  most  advanced  in  Latin 
America;  only  Argentina  has  provided  serious  competition. 
Brazil  has  one  nuclear  power  plant  in  operation  (Angra  I)  and 
two  under  construction  (Angra  II  and  III) .  Its  nuclear-enrich- 
ment program  is  multifaceted,  with  the  military  services 
involved  in  separate  projects:  the  navy,  centrifuge  enrichment; 
the  air  force,  laser  enrichment;  and  the  army,  gas  graphite 
enrichment. 

The  history  of  Brazil's  nuclear  programs  can  be  traced  back 
to  the  early  1930s,  with  the  initial  research  in  nuclear  fission. 
Much  of  that  early  research  was  conducted  at  the  USP  (Univer- 
sity of  Sao  Paulo),  some  by  scientists  who  had  been  contracted 
from  abroad.  By  the  mid-1930s,  Brazil  had  discovered  vast 
deposits  of  uranium.  In  1940  President  Getulio  Vargas  signed 
an  agreement  with  the  United  States  for  cooperative  mining, 
including  mining  for  uranium  and  monazite.  During  the 
1940s,  Brazil  signed  three  additional  agreements  with  the 
United  States.  In  exchange  for  monazite,  the  United  States 
transferred  nuclear  technology. 

In  the  early  1950s,  President  Vargas  encouraged  the  develop- 
ment of  independent  national  nuclear  capabilities.  He  offered 
to  sell  uranium  or  thorium  to  the  United  States  in  exchange 
for  nuclear  technology.  Under  Vargas  Brazil  sought  to  pur- 
chase three  ultracentrifuge  systems  for  uranium  enrichment 
from  West  Germany.  After  Vargas's  death,  Acting  President 
Joao  Cafe  Filho  (1954-55)  reversed  the  nationalistic  nuclear 
policy  and  allowed  the  United  States  to  control  uranium 
research  and  extraction  for  two  years. 

President  Juscelino  Kubitschek  (1956-61),  a  pro-Vargas  poli- 
tician, sought  to  develop  indigenous  nuclear  capabilities  by 
appointing  a  Congressional  Investigating  Committee  (Comis- 
sao  Parlamentar  de  Inquerito — CPI)  to  examine  United  States 
nuclear  ties  with  Brazil.  The  CPI  urged  Brazil  to  adopt  an  inde- 
pendent nuclear  posture.  As  a  result,  Kubitschek  in  1956  cre- 
ated the  IP  EN  (Institute  for  Energy  and  Nuclear  Research). 
Kubitschek's  successor,  Janio  Quadros  (president,  January- 
August  1961),  continued  the  independent  nuclear  policy, 
which  was  based  on  natural  uranium,  as  did  his  successor,  Joao 
Goulart  (president,  1961-64). 

As  part  of  that  independent  nuclear  policy,  the  CNEN 
(National  Nuclear  Energy  Commission)  was  created  formally 
on  August  27,  1962.  The  CNEN  is  under  the  direct  control  of 


445 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

the  Strategic  Affairs  Secretariat  (Secretaria  de  Assuntos 
Estrategicos — SAE)  of  the  Brazilian  presidency.  According  to 
the  1988  constitution,  the  CNEN  is  responsible  for  the  orienta- 
tion, planning,  supervision,  and  control  of  Brazil's  nuclear  pro- 
grams. 

The  CNEN  is  located  in  Rio  Janeiro,  and  is  divided  into 
three  directorates:  Directorate  of  Research  and  Development 
(Diretoria  de  Pesquisa  e  Desenvolvimento — DPD),  Directorate 
of  Radiation  Protection  and  Nuclear  Safety  (Diretoria  de 
Radioprotecao  e  Seguranca  Nuclear — DRS),  and  Directorate 
of  Logistical  Support  (Diretoria  de  Apoio  Logfstico — DAL). 
The  DPD  is  further  subdivided  into  three  scientific  and  techno- 
logical institutes:  the  IPEN,  in  Sao  Paulo;  the  Center  for  Devel- 
opment of  Nuclear  Technology  (Centro  de  Desenvolvimento 
de  Tecnologia  Nuclear — CDTN),  which  was  created  in  1952  in 
Belo  Horizonte  as  Brazil's  first  nuclear  research  institute;  and 
the  Nuclear  Engineering  Institute  (Instituto  de  Engenharia 
Nuclear — IEN),  in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  The  DRS  is  composed  of  the 
Radiation  Protection  and  Dosimetry  Institute  (Instituto  de 
Radioprotecao  e  Dosimetria — IRD),  in  Rio  de  Janeiro;  the 
Licensing  and  Control  Superintendency  (Superintendencia  de 
Licenciamento  e  Controle — SLC),  with  its  major  laboratory  in 
Pocos  de  Caldas,  Minas  Gerais  State;  and  various  regional  units. 

The  most  important  of  the  CNEN's  research  institutes  is  the 
IPEN,  a  civilian  agency  that  is  associated  with  the  SCTDE  (Sao 
Paulo  State's  Secretariat  for  Science,  Technology,  and  Eco- 
nomic Development),  and  linked  to  the  USP  (University  of  Sao 
Paulo)  (the  IPEN  provides  teaching  and  graduate  education). 
The  IPEN  has  a  broad  infrastructure  of  laboratories,  a  research 
reactor  (IEA-R1),  an  industrial  accelerator  of  electrons,  and  a 
compact  cyclotron  of  variable  energy.  The  IPEN  is  involved  pri- 
marily in  conducting  research  in  the  areas  of  nuclear  materials 
and  processes,  nuclear  reactors,  applications  of  nuclear  tech- 
niques, and  nuclear  safety.  The  IPEN  is  noted  for  its  produc- 
tion of  radioisotopes  for  nuclear  medicine. 

Despite  Brazil's  search  for  autonomy  in  the  nuclear  sphere, 
it  continued  to  receive  technical  assistance  from  the  United 
States.  In  1957  Brazil  built  the  first  of  two  nuclear  research 
reactors  in  Sao  Paulo,  with  United  States  support  under  the 
Atoms  for  Peace  Program.  That  program  had  its  origins  in  the 
Dwight  D.  Eisenhower  administration  (1953-61).  Under  the 
program,  the  United  States  agreed  to  share  nuclear  technology 
for  peaceful  purposes,  but  retained  ultimate  control  over  the 


446 


Science  and  Technology 


processes.  A  second  reactor  was  developed  in  Belo  Horizonte 
in  1960.  In  1965  Brazil  built  its  first  indigenous  research  reac- 
tor in  Rio  de  Janeiro.  The  United  States  supplied  the  medium- 
grade  enriched  uranium  for  the  reactor. 

The  construction  of  these  reactors  was  controlled  strictly  by 
the  United  States.  Brazil  provided  natural  uranium  to  the 
United  States  and  paid  to  have  it  processed.  In  turn  the  United 
States  supplied  Brazil  with  the  enriched  fuel  required  for  its 
reactors.  As  envisioned  by  the  Atoms  for  Peace  Program,  the 
United  States  retained  control  of  the  technology  and  by-prod- 
ucts created  by  Brazilian  reactors. 

Based  on  the  success  of  these  research  reactors,  plans  were 
made  for  a  nuclear  reactor  to  produce  electricity.  In  1968  the 
CNEN  and  Eletrobras  were  tasked  with  building  a  nuclear 
power  plant  at  Angra  dos  Reis,  Rio  de  Janeiro  State.  Three 
years  later,  the  Westinghouse  Electric  Corporation  agreed  to 
supply  the  technology  for  the  power  plant,  and  construction  of 
Angra  I  began.  However,  Brazilian  authorities  were  dissatisfied 
with  the  Westinghouse  accord,  because  it  barred  the  transfer  of 
United  States  nuclear  technology  to  Brazil,  made  Brazil  depen- 
dent on  United  States  uranium  for  the  reactor,  and  required 
that  all  Brazilian  nuclear  facilities  be  safeguarded  by  the  Inter- 
national Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA). 

Brazil's  military  governments  continued  to  assert  autono- 
mous nuclear  strategies.  These  regimes  were  frustrated  by 
restrictions  imposed  by  the  United  States  on  its  nuclear  pro- 
grams, concerned  with  Argentina's  rapid  nuclear  development, 
and  facing  energy  shortages  (accentuated  by  the  petroleum  cri- 
sis of  October  1973).  A  turning  point  was  the  inauguration  of 
President  Ernesto  Geisel  in  March  1974.  A  former  president  of 
Petrobras,  the  petroleum  monopoly,  Geisel  was  concerned  with 
the  country's  pressing  energy  needs.  In  December  1974,  he  cre- 
ated the  Brazilian  Nuclear  Corporations  (Empresas  Nucleares 
Brasileiras  S.A. — Nuclebras),  a  state  company  tasked  with 
expanding  the  nuclear  programs. 

Brazil  was  faced  with  a  technical  dilemma:  it  could  switch  to 
natural  uranium  technology,  which  could  be  pursued  indepen- 
dently; or  it  could  continue  to  pursue  the  more  costly  and 
advanced  enriched  uranium  technology,  but  with  external 
assistance.  Brazilian  policy  makers  opted  for  the  latter,  but 
given  that  the  United  States  had  been  an  unreliable  supplier, 
Brazil  was  forced  to  look  elsewhere  for  assistance. 


447 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

Brazil  made  a  radical  change  in  1975,  when  it  opted  for 
nuclear  technology  from  West  Germany,  despite  strong  pro- 
tests from  the  United  States.  The  agreement,  signed  on  June 
27,  called  for  West  Germany  to  transfer  eight  nuclear  reactors 
(each  of  which  could  produce  1,300  megawatts),  a  commercial- 
scale  uranium  enrichment  facility,  a  pilot-scale  plutonium 
reprocessing  plant,  and  Becker  "jet  nozzle"  enrichment  tech- 
nology. West  Germany's  Kraftwerk  Union,  an  affiliate  of  Sie- 
mens, was  hired  to  construct  the  power  plants.  The  projected 
cost  of  the  program  was  US$4  billion,  to  be  paid  over  a  fifteen- 
year  period.  The  most  important  element  of  the  agreement  was 
that  it  called  for  the  first-ever  transfer  of  technology  for  a  com- 
plete nuclear  fuel  cycle,  including  enrichment  and  reprocess- 
ing. The  United  States  government  opposed  the  accord 
vigorously.  Although  it  was  unable  to  revoke  the  agreement, 
the  United  States  convinced  West  Germany  to  enact  stringent 
safeguards. 

Many  experts  have  questioned  the  cost-effectiveness  of  Bra- 
zil's nuclear  power  plants.  The  Angra  I  power  plant  cost  US$2 
billion  to  build,  and  it  began  to  operate  commercially  in  1983. 
When  Angra  I  is  in  full  operation,  it  produces  20  percent  of  the 
electricity  used  in  the  city  of  Rio  de  Janeiro.  From  1985 
through  1993,  however,  Angra  I  was  turned  off  more  than 
thirty  times  because  of  technical  problems  and  legal  chal- 
lenges, earning  it  the  nickname  "firefly."  Furnas  Electric  Power 
Plants,  Inc.  (Furnas  Centrais  Eletricas  S.A. — Furnas),  the  state 
company  that  administers  Angra  1,  ldst  US$100  million  in 
operating  costs  in  1993  alone  because  the  plant  was  closed 
down  most  of  the  year.  The  plant  is  expected  to  be  torn  down 
in  2009,  at  a  cost  of  US$200  million. 

Angra  II,  under  construction  since  1977,  was  projected  to  be 
ready  by  1993,  but  in  early  1996  its  completion  date  was  still 
uncertain.  The  construction  of  Angra  II  had  cost  at  least 
US$4.6  billion  through  1993,  and  it  was  estimated  that  at  least 
an  additional  US$1.5  billion  would  be  necessary  to  complete 
the  project.  Various  experts  projected  that  the  total  cost  of  the 
plant  construction  would  exceed  US$10  billion.  Still  in  its  early 
phases  of  construction,  Angra  III  cost  US$1  billion  through 
1993.  On  October  18,  1994,  President  Itamar  Franco  (1992- 
94)  requested  that  US$400  million  in  funding  that  had  been 
allocated  to  Angra  III  be  transferred  to  Angra  II.  Given  the 
severe  budget  constraints,  the  construction  of  Angra  III  and 
additional  power  plants  appear  doubtful. 


448 


Science  and  Technology 


West  Germany  did  not  require  IAEA  safeguards,  and  follow- 
ing the  1975  agreement  Brazil  transferred  technology  from  its 
power  plant  projects  to  a  secret  program  to  develop  an  atom 
bomb.  Code-named  "Solimoes,"  after  a  river  in  the  Amazon, 
the  secret  program  was  started  in  1975  and  eventually  came  to 
be  known  publicly  as  the  Parallel  Program.  In  1987 Jose  Sarney 
(president,  1985-90)  announced  that  Brazil  had  enriched  ura- 
nium successfully  on  a  laboratory  scale  to  20  percent.  At  that 
time,  some  observers  predicted  that  Brazil  would  have  a 
nuclear-weapons  capability  by  the  turn  of  the  century.  Presi- 
dent Fernando  Collor  de  Mello  took  bold  steps  to  control  and 
restrict  Brazil's  nuclear  programs.  In  September  1990,  he  sym- 
bolically closed  a  test  site  at  Gachimbo,  in  Para  State.  That 
October,  he  formally  exposed  the  military's  secret  plan  to 
develop  an  atom  bomb. 

Within  Brazil's  Congress,  a  CPI  looked  into  the  Parallel  Pro- 
gram. Members  visited  numerous  facilities,  including  the  Insti- 
tute of  Advanced  Studies  (Instituto  de  Estudos  Avancados — 
IEAv)  at  the  Aerospace  Technical  Center  (Centro  Tecnico 
Aeroespacial — CTA)  in  Sao  Jose  dos  Campos.  They  also  inter- 
viewed key  players  in  the  nuclear  program,  such  as  Joao 
Figueiredo  (president,  1979-85)  and  retired  Army  General 
Danilo  Venturini,  the  former  head  of  the  National  Security 
Council  (Conselho  de  Seguranca  Nacional — CSN)  under 
Figueiredo.  The  CPI  investigation  exposed  secret  bank 
accounts,  code-named  "Delta,"  which  were  managed  by  the 
CNEN  and  used  for  funding  the  program.  The  most  disturbing 
revelation  in  the  CPI  report  was  that  the  IEAv  had  designed  two 
atomic  bomb  devices,  one  weighing  twenty  to  thirty  kilotons 
and  a  second  weighing  twelve  kilotons.  It  was  also  revealed  that 
Brazil's  military  regime  secretly  exported  eight  tons  of  uranium 
to  Iraq  in  1981. 

Through  a  series  of  agreements,  Brazil  and  Argentina  have 
defused  the  issue  of  nuclear  rivalry.  On  May  20,  1980,  while 
under  military  rule,  both  countries  signed  the  Brazilian-Argen- 
tine Agreement  on  the  Peaceful  Use  of  Nuclear  Energy,  estab- 
lishing technical  cooperation  in  developing  the  nuclear  fuel 
cycle  and  coordination  of  nuclear  policy.  President  Sarney  and 
Argentine  president  Raul  Alfonsfn  strengthened  this  coopera- 
tion in  1985,  with  the  Joint  Declarations  on  Nuclear  Policy  of 
Foz  do  Iguacu.  After  the  1985  agreement,  the  presidents  and 
technical  staffs  made  reciprocal  visits  to  nonsafeguarded 
nuclear  installations  in  both  countries.  The  heads  of  state 


449 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

made  subsequent  joint  declarations  in  Brasilia  (1986);  Viedma, 
Argentina  (1987);  Ipero,  Brazil  (1988);  and  Buenos  Aires 
(1990). 

On  November  28,  1990,  Presidents  Collor  de  Mello  and  Car- 
los Saul  Menem  of  Argentina  signed  the  second  Foz  do  Iguacu 
declaration  (Argentine-Brazilian  Declaration  on  Common 
Nuclear  Policy  of  Foz  do  Iguacu),  in  which  both  governments 
pledged  their  commitment  to  an  exclusively  peaceful  use  of 
nuclear  energy  and  established  a  Common  System  for  Account- 
ing and  Control  of  Nuclear  Materials  (Sistema  Comum  de 
Contabilidade  e  Controle  de  Materials  Nucleares — SCCCMN) . 
On  July  18,  1991,  Presidents  Collor  de  Mello  and  Menem 
agreed  to  establish  the  Agreement  on  the  Exclusively  Peaceful 
Use  of  Nuclear  Energy,  which  created  the  Brazilian-Argentine 
Agency  for  Accounting  and  Control  of  Nuclear  Materials 
(Agenda  Brasileiro-Argentina  de  Contabilidade  e  Controle  de 
Materials  Nucleares — ABACC).  That  agreement  entered  into 
force  on  December  12,  1991,  after  ratification  by  the  legisla- 
tures in  both  countries.  With  headquarters  in  Rio  de  Janeiro, 
the  ABACC  provides  on-site  inspections  of  nuclear  facilities  in 
Argentina  and  Brazil  and  maintains  an  inventory  of  nuclear 
material  in  each  country. 

The  most  important  nuclear  accord  between  Brazil  and 
Argentina  was  signed  on  December  13,  1991,  in  a  meeting 
attended  by  Presidents  Collor  de  Mello  and  Menem  at  the 
headquarters  of  the  IAEA  in  Vienna.  The  accord  is  referred  to 
as  the  quadripartite  agreement,  because  it  was  signed  by  Brazil, 
Argentina,  the  IAEA,  and  the  ABACC.  The  agreement  allows 
for  full-scope  IAEA  safeguards  of  Argentine  and  Brazilian 
nuclear  installations.  It  also  allows  the  two  countries  to  retain 
full  rights  over  any  "technological  secrets"  and  to  develop 
nuclear  energy  for  the  propulsion  of  submarines.  Brazil's  Sen- 
ate ratified  the  agreement  on  February  9,  1994,  but  only  after 
considerable  pressure  by  Brazil's  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs 
(Itamaraty). 

On  May  30,  1994,  Brazil  ratified  the  Treaty  of  Tlatelolco  (see 
Glossary),  following  the  lead  of  Argentina  and  Chile,  which 
had  ratified  it  on  January  18,  1994.  In  Brazil  there  was  an  active 
lobby  against  the  quadripartite  agreement  and  the  Treaty  of 
Tlatelolco.  Indeed,  it  took  Brazil  considerably  longer  than 
Argentina  to  approve  those  pacts.  Brazilian  diplomats  have 
argued  that  the  Non-Proliferation  Treaty  (NPT)  is  discrimina- 
tory because  it  excludes  capabilities  of  those  already  in  the 


450 


Science  and  Technology 


club.  Furthermore,  some  Brazilians  have  argued  that  the  NPT 
is  an  infringement  on  sovereignty  and  that  the  current  agree- 
ments are  sufficient  and  even  stronger  than  the  NPT.  Neverthe- 
less, Brazil  finally  agreed  in  1997  to  ratify  the  NPT. 

Some  observers  have  argued  that  Brazil  is  still  seeking  the 
technological  capability  to  produce  a  nuclear  bomb,  despite 
the  1991  quadripartite  agreement,  the  full  ratification  of  the 
Treaty  of  Tlatelolco,  and  a  provision  in  Brazil's  1988  constitu- 
tion that  bars  the  development  of  nuclear  energy  for  anything 
but  peaceful  purposes.  They  note  that  Brazil's  nuclear  program 
is  under  the  primary  control  of  the  military,  which  resents 
IAEA  inspections.  Brazil's  Senate  required  a  "supplementary 
adjustment"  to  the  treaty  that  protects  "industrial  secrets,"  pos- 
sibly the  nation's  Aramar  centrifuge  enrichment  facilities,  from 
on-site  inspections.  The  Aramar  Experimental  Center  was  inau- 
gurated in  1988  and  is  the  only  uranium  enrichment  plant  in 
Brazil.  It  is  located  in  the  interior  of  Sao  Paulo,  in  the  town  of 
Ipero.  A  further  amendment  was  added  that  bans  IAEA  inspec- 
tions outside  the  normal  schedule.  Finally,  Brazil  was  allowed 
to  provide  an  accounting  of  the  uranium  that  has  already  been 
enriched,  but  the  IAEA  and  ABACC  have  no  way  to  verify  that 
amount.  The  dual  nature  of  nuclear  energy  allows  it  to  be  used 
for  both  peaceful  and  military  purposes.  The  military  applica- 
tion of  Brazil's  nuclear  programs,  therefore,  depends  less  on 
technological  considerations  than  on  political  will. 

Most  observers,  however,  are  more  optimistic  about  Brazil's 
nuclear  intentions.  Argentine  diplomat  and  nuclear  expert 
Julio  Cesar  Carasales  has  argued  that  Brazil's  nuclear  programs 
need  to  be  understood  in  the  context  of  Brazil's  rapproche- 
ment with  Argentina.  In  that  context,  he  concluded  that, 
"Extraordinary  accomplishments  already  have  been  achieved 
and  have  been  generally  welcomed;  there  is  no  danger  that  the 
process  will  be  reversed  or  undermined;  the  time  has  come  to 
consolidate  the  bilateral  arrangements;  the  nuclear  control 
agency,  the  ABACC,  is  performing  in  a  satisfactory  matter;  new 
substantial  agreements  are  not  to  be  expected;  and  some  policy 
divergence  is  possible,  as  in  the  case  of  the  NPT,  although  there 
are  reasons  to  predict  that  in  the  long  run  Brazil  will  join  that 
treaty."  Indeed,  in  1997  Brazil  announced  its  adherence  to  the 
NPT. 

Brazil's  nuclear  programs  have  experienced  severe  financial 
constraints  since  1990,  when  Collor  de  Mello  was  president. 
The  Aramar  Experimental  Center  dismissed  700  of  its  1,600

employees  between  August  1994  and  March  1995.  The  comple- 
tion date  for  the  navy's  nuclear-powered  submarine  was  post- 
poned several  times,  from  1995  to  2010.  Until  1995  that  project 
had  cost  an  estimated  US$1  billion.  The  submarine  program, 
rarely  scrutinized  in  the  past,  was  the  subject  of  scathing  criti- 
cism by  Veja,  the  leading  weekly  news  magazine,  in  December 
1994.  The  magazine  raised  allegations  of  corruption  and 
exposed  technical  difficulties  with  the  program. 

Despite  such  financial  and  technical  hurdles,  it  is  likely  that 
Brazil  will  continue  to  fund  efforts  to  develop  more  autono- 
mous nuclear  programs.  Indeed,  the  administration  of 
Fernando  Henrique  Cardoso  (president,  1995-  )  in  mid-1995 
placed  a  high  priority  on  completing  the  Angra  II  nuclear 
power  plant.  Such  programs  will  be  pursued  in  a  more  open 
environment,  given  the  many  bilateral  and  multilateral  nuclear 
accords  signed  by  Brazil. 

The  Space  Program 

Brazil  has  the  most  advanced  space  program  in  Latin  Amer- 
ica, with  significant  capabilities  in  launch  vehicles,  launch  sites, 
and  satellite  manufacturing.  In  an  attempt  to  build  a  Satellite 
Launch  Vehicle  (Vefculo  Lancador  de  Satelite — VLS),  Brazil 
has  since  1964  developed  a  series  of  sounding  (research)  rock- 
ets, named  Sonda  I,  II,  III,  and  IV.  The  early  Sondas  were  test- 
launched  from  Barreira  do  Inferno  (literally,  "Barrier  of  Hell") 
Launch  Center  (Centro  de  Lancamento  da  Barreira  do 
Inferno),  near  the  city  of  Natal  in  the  Northeast  (Nordeste). 
The  Sonda  IV  rocket  was  tested  successfully  on  April  28,  1989. 
Subsequent  launches  were  made  from  the  Alcantara  Launch- 
ing Center  (Centro  de  Lancamento  de  Alcantara — CLA),  in 
Maranhao,  President  Sarney's  home  state.  The  CLA,  officially 
dedicated  on  February  21,  1990,  cost  more  than  US$470  mil- 
lion to  develop.  It  is  the  closest  launch  center  to  the  equator  in 
the  world  (2.3  degrees  south  of  the  equator),  making  it  attrac- 
tive for  launches  of  geostationary  satellites.  For  example, 
because  it  is  so  close  to  the  equator  it  provides  a  25  percent  fuel 
savings  compared  with  Cape  Kennedy. 

On  February  9,  1993,  the  first  satellite  developed  entirely  in 
Brazil,  the  Data-Collecting  Satellite  (Satelite  de  Coleta  de 
Dados — SCD-1),  was  launched  from  a  United  States  B-52 
plane  carrying  a  Pegasus  rocket  made  by  the  American  Orbital 
Science  Corporation.  The  SCD-1,  sometimes  referred  to  as  the 
"green"  satellite,  is  used  by  INPE  agencies,  such  as  the  Weather

Forecasting  and  Climate  Studies  Center  (Centro  de  Previsao 
do  Tempo  e  Estudos  Climaticos — CPTEC),  for  collecting  mete- 
orological and  environmental  data  on  the  Amazon  region, 
including  the  levels  of  carbon  monoxide  and  carbon  dioxide  in 
the  atmosphere.  The  data  are  transmitted  to  the  INPE 
(National  Institute  of  Space  Research)  and  are  used  for  moni- 
toring forest  fires.  More  than  thirty  companies  were  involved  in 
the  construction  of  the  SCD-1,  with  the  INPE  providing  most 
of  the  electronic  hardware  equipment.  The  SCD-2,  which  was 
scheduled  to  be  launched  by  a  Brazilian-made  rocket,  will  also 
be  used  to  collect  environmental  data.  Brazil  is  also  developing 
the  Remote  Sensing  Satellite  (Satelite  de  Sensoriamento 
Remoto— SSR-1). 


453 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

On  July  6,  1988,  Brazil  signed  an  agreement  with  China  that 
calls  for  the  joint  development  (between  the  INPE  and  the  Chi- 
nese Space  Agency)  of  two  earth-imaging  satellites  to  be 
launched  by  a  Long  March  Chinese  rocket  from  the  Shanxi 
Launching  site.  Known  as  the  China-Brazil  Earth  Resources 
Satellite  (Satelite  Sino-Brasileiro  de  Recursos  Terrestres — 
CBERS),  the  high-resolution  CBERS  will  collect  data  from  the 
entire  planet  and  will  be  used  for  agriculture,  geology,  hydrol- 
ogy, and  the  environment.  The  Sino-Brazilian  agreement  was 
inactive  from  1988  through  1991  because  of  Brazil's  lack  of 
funds.  In  October  1991  and  November  1994,  Brazil  and  China 
signed  additional  agreements  for  the  construction  of  the  satel- 
lites, worth  US$150  million.  The  CBERS-1  was  scheduled  to  be 
launched  in  May  1997. 

The  Brazilian  Telecommunications  Company  (Empresa 
Brasileira  de  Telecomunicacoes — Embratel),  a  state-controlled 
agency  in  charge  of  the  Brazilian  Satellite  Communication  Sys- 
tem (Sistema  Brasileiro  de  Comunicacao  por  Satellites — SBTS), 
owns  and  operates  a  series  of  satellites  that  are  positioned  in 
geostationary  orbit  over  the  equator.  Arianespace,  a  French 
space  and  defense  partner  of  France's  Aerospatiale  group, 
launched  the  first  two  Brasilsat  satellites  in  February  1985  and 
March  1986. 

Until  1994  the  military  directed  most  of  the  space  program 
through  the  Ministry  of  Aeronautics,  which  is  in  charge  of  the 
CTA.  Created  in  1950,  the  CTA  is  involved  in  research  and 
development  for  the  aerospace  programs  of  the  FAB  (Brazilian 
Air  Force).  In  1965  the  FAB  created  the  Space  Activities  Center 
(Instituto  de  Atividades  Espaciais — IAE),  one  of  several  insti- 
tutes within  the  CTA,  to  develop  rockets.  Since  its  creation,  the 
IAE  has  tested  more  than  2,000  rockets. 

In  1971  a  joint  civilian-military  committee,  the  Brazilian 
Commission  for  Space  Activities  (Comissao  Brasileira  de  Ativi- 
dades Espaciais — Cobae),  was  established  and  placed  under 
the  CSN  (National  Security  Council) .  Cobae  was  chaired  by  the 
head  of  the  Armed  Forces  General  Staff  (Estado-Maior  das 
Forcas  Armadas — EMFA)  and  was  in  charge  of  the  Complete 
Brazilian  Space  Mission  (Missao  Espacial  Completa 
Brasileira— MECB).  The  MECB  was  created  in  1981  to  coordi- 
nate launch  vehicles,  launch  sites,  and  the  manufacturing  of 
satellites. 

On  the  civilian  side,  the  MECB  is  headed  by  the  INPE.  Estab- 
lished in  1971,  the  INPE  replaced  the  National  Commission  for 


454 


A  Brazilian  Air  Force  AMX  tactical  fighter  made  by  Embraer 
Courtesy  Brazilian  Embassy,  Washington 

Space  Activities  (Comissao  Nacional  de  Atividades  Espaciais — 
CNAE).  The  INPE  is  subordinate  to  the  Ministry  of  Science 
and  Technology  and  roughly  the  CTA's  counterpart.  The  INPE 
develops  satellites  and  conducts  space  and  meteorological 
research.  It  has  also  been  developing  engines  using  liquid  pro- 
pellants  since  1988,  but  with  mixed  results. 

Within  Brazil's  MECB,  civilians  have  been  primarily  responsi- 
ble for  satellite  production,  and  the  armed  forces  have  been  in 
charge  of  developing  launch  pads  and  rockets.  Despite  this 
division  of  labor,  the  armed  forces  were  the  dominant  actors  in 
the  MECB,  at  least  through  1993.  Military  officers  occupied 
most  of  the  high-ranking  positions  in  the  MECB. 

In  an  attempt  to  place  the  MECB  more  firmly  in  the  hands 
of  civilians,  Brazil's  President  Itamar  Franco  signed  a  bill  on 
February  10,  1994,  creating  the  Brazilian  Space  Agency  (Agen- 
da Espacial  Brasileira — AEB).  The  AEB  replaced  Cobae,  which 
acted  merely  as  an  advisory  body  and  had  no  staff.  The  AEB,  a 
semi-autonomous  agency,  has  its  own  staff  and  responsibilities 
for  policy  implementation.  It  is  led  by  a  civilian,  who  is  under 
the  direct  control  of  the  president.  The  AEB  oversees  the 
MECB,  but  the  Ministry  of  Aeronautics  is  still  in  charge  of 
launch  facilities  and  launch  vehicles,  and  the  INPE  continues 
to  direct  the  development  of  satellites.  It  remains  to  be  seen, 


455 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

therefore,  whether  the  AEB  can  effectively  oversee  the  various 
ministries  involved  in  the  MECB. 

The  AEB  was  created  in  part  to  deflect  criticism  from  the 
United  States  government,  which  viewed  with  alarm  the 
involvement  of  Brazil's  military  in  the  MECB.  The  United 
States  played  a  central  role  in  the  development  of  Brazil's 
MECB,  beginning  with  its  financial  and  technological  support 
for  the  CTA  and  the  INPE.  In  1966  the  United  States  supplied 
sounding  rockets,  which  were  launched  subsequently  by  Brazil. 
Based  on  that  technology,  Brazil  later  developed  larger  boost- 
ers of  its  own. 

The  ties  between  Brazil  and  the  United  States  were  generally 
along  functional  lines  within  the  two  governments.  The  United 
States  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration  (NASA) 
worked  with  the  INPE,  sharing  data,  helping  to  develop  and 
implement  scientific  experiments,  and  training  the  institute's 
technicians  and  scientists.  Likewise,  the  United  States  Air  Force 
worked  with  Brazil's  Ministry  of  Aeronautics  and  established  a 
number  of  data-exchange  agreements  with  the  CTA  that  cov- 
ered such  matters  as  weather  forecasting. 

Brazil  no  longer  relies  as  heavily  on  the  United  States  for 
space  technology.  In  1981  it  unveiled  the  MECB,  an  ambitious 
US$1  billion  program  with  the  aim  of  attaining  self-sufficiency 
in  space  technology.  At  that  time,  Brazil  committed  itself  to 
launching  a  series  of  four  Brazilian-made  satellites  (two  for 
weather  forecasting  and  two  for  terrain  photography)  from 
Alcantara. 

In  further  moves  away  from  dependence  on  the  United 
States,  in  the  1980s  Brazil  took  steps  to  become  self-sufficient  in 
the  production  of  ammonium  perchlorate,  an  oxidizer  for 
solid  fuels.  In  addition  to  its  indigenous  research  and  develop- 
ment, Brazil  now  cooperates  in  its  space  program  with  Canada, 
the  European  Space  Agency  (ESA),  Russia,  France,  and  espe- 
cially China.  One  joint  satellite  project  with  China  is  the  China- 
Brazil  Earth  Resources  Satellite.  Brazil  is  also  seeking  space 
cooperation  with  new  partners,  such  as  Israel. 

In  the  mid-1980s  through  the  early  1990s,  many  United 
States  policy  makers  were  concerned  with  Brazil's  MECB 
because  of  the  possibility  of  diverting  space-launch  technology 
to  a  ballistic  missile  program.  Although  by  mid-1997  Brazil  had 
not  produced  a  ballistic  missile,  its  military  had  given  high  pri- 
ority to  the  development  of  several  missile  systems,  including 
the  Piranha  missile  (MAA-1).  Brazil's  space-launch  program,

coupled  with  its  artillery  rocket  technology,  suggests  that  the 
country  has  the  potential  to  develop  advanced  missiles,  includ- 
ing ballistic  missiles. 

From  1987  to  1994,  the  United  States  sought  to  stifle  the 
development  of  Brazil's  ballistic  missile  program  through  the 
Missile  Technology  Control  Regime  (MTCR — see  Glossary), 
formed  on  April  16,  1987.  Given  Brazil's  advanced  nuclear  pro- 
gram, the  United  States  was  especially  concerned  that  a  poten- 
tial Brazilian  ballistic  missile  could  eventually  serve  as  a  vehicle 
for  a  nuclear  warhead.  The  United  States  restrictions  on  space 
technology  to  Brazil  stalled  Brazil's  VLS  (Satellite  Launch  Vehi- 
cle) program  and  ballistic  missile  research  and  development, 
strained  United  States  security  relations  with  Brazil,  and 
prompted  Brazil  to  explore  closer  ties  with  China,  Russia,  and 


457 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

various  countries  in  Europe  and  the  Middle  East  (especially 
Iraq).  In  October  1995,  for  example,  Brazil  offered  Russia  the 
use  of  its  Alcantara  base,  to  launch  rockets. 

On  February  11,  1994,  Brazil  announced  that  it  would  com- 
ply with  MTCR  guidelines.  Such  compliance  would  include 
export  controls  on  Brazilian  space  and  missile  goods  and  tech- 
nology. Brazil's  accession  to  the  MTCR  coincided  with  various 
attempts  by  the  United  States  to  cooperate  in  space  activities 
and  seemed  to  signal  a  new  era  in  space  relations.  Brazil's  appli- 
cation for  MTCR  membership  was  accepted  in  October  1995. 
Thus,  by  the  end  of  1995  Brazil's  space  capabilities  were 
improving,  although  they  were  modest  by  the  standards  of 
countries  such  as  the  United  States  and  Russia. 

Missile  Programs 

The  potential  military  applications  of  Brazil's  MECB  center 
around  the  Sonda  IV  and  its  VLS,  which  could  be  used  for  a 
ballistic  missile.  Sonda  IV  has  a  range  of  600  kilometers  and 
can  carry  a  500-kilogram  payload,  and  is  therefore  subject  to 
MTCR  restrictions.  The  transformation  of  the  Sonda  IV  into  an 
intercontinental  ballistic  missile  (ICBM)  would  require  several 
more  successful  launches  and  a  major  technological  leap,  espe- 
cially in  payload  shielding  and  guidance. 

Many  of  the  factors  that  drove  Brazil's  nuclear  programs  also 
have  driven  the  space  and  missile  programs.  In  the  mid-1980s, 
Brazil  was  concerned  with  Argentina's  Condor  II  ballistic  mis- 
sile program,  which  received  substantial  technological  assis- 
tance from  Europe  and  funding  from  Iraq.  In  the  late  1980s 
and  early  1990s,  however,  Argentina  dismantled  its  Condor 
missile  program  and  removed  that  rationale  for  Brazil's  MECB. 
Brazil's  quest  for  advanced  technology  drives  much  of  the 
space  and  ballistic  missile  programs.  For  example,  Brazilian 
authorities  considered  the  April  1990  purchase  of  follow-on  sat- 
ellites for  the  Brazilian  Satellite  (Brasilsat)  program  an  oppor- 
tunity to  receive  valuable  technology.  The  Brazilian 
government  specifically  required  that  the  transfer  of  satellite 
technology  be  a  precondition  for  the  purchase  of  the  satellites. 
In  sum,  an  attempt  by  Brazil  to  produce  a  ballistic  missile  is 
driven  primarily  by  a  search  for  technological  autonomy, 
although  political,  security,  and  economic  motives  are  also 
important. 

The  government  of  Brazil  has  stated  that  it  supports  the 
peaceful  applications  of  space  technology  and  denies  any 


458 


Science  and  Technology 


intention  of  developing  a  ballistic  missile.  It  argues  that  the 
Sonda  IV  is  only  a  satellite  launcher  and  lacks  the  required 
accuracy  for  military  use.  At  least  one  missile  expert,  Steven  M. 
Flank,  has  argued  that  if  Brazil  had  intended  to  develop  a  bal- 
listic missile  it  would  not  have  chosen  the  Sonda  technological 
path.  He  notes,  for  example,  that  the  VLS  employed  in  the 
Sondas  are  solid-propellant  systems,  which  are  not  as  effective 
as  liquid-propellants  for  launching  ballistic  missiles. 

The  armed  forces  have  even  greater  control  over  missile  pro- 
duction than  they  do  over  the  MECB.  Following  a  meeting  in 
June  1986  among  six  companies,  the  Armed  Forces  General 
Staff  (EMFA),  and  the  three  military  ministries,  missile  produc- 
tion was  placed  under  the  authority  of  the  Armed  Forces  Joint 
Command  (Comando  Geral  das  Forcas  Armadas — CMFA).  All 
missile  manufacturers  are  required  to  submit  programs  to  the 
CMFA,  which  evaluates  them  and  awards  contracts. 

The  most  important  Brazilian  company  involved  in  incipient 
missile  technology  is  Avibras  Aerospace  Industry,  Inc.  (Avibras 
Industria  Aeroespacial  S.A. — Avibras).  The  Astros  II,  a  multiple 
rocket  launcher,  is  the  most  profitable  weapon  produced  by 
Avibras.  It  can  launch  rockets  of  different  caliber:  SS-30  rock- 
ets up  to  thirty  kilometers;  SS-40  rockets,  forty  kilometers;  and 
SS-60  rockets,  sixty  kilometers.  In  the  1980s,  Avibras  sold  an 
estimated  sixty-six  Astros  II  artillery  systems  to  Iraq  and  an 
unspecified  number  to  Saudi  Arabia,  Bahrain,  and  Qatar.  Total 
sales  of  the  Astros  II  between  1982  and  1987  reached  US$1  bil- 
lion. 

In  the  late  1980s,  Avibras  was  involved  in  the  development  of 
the  SS-150  (based  on  the  Astros-II),  the  SS-300,  and  the  SS- 
1000  (based  largely  on  the  Sonda  rockets).  All  Avibras  pro- 
grams were  "put  on  hold"  in  January  1990,  when  the  company 
filed  for  bankruptcy.  Its  employee  roster  had  fallen  from  6,000 
to  900,  and  the  company  had  US$90  million  worth  of  unsold 
rockets.  Although  Avibras  improved  its  financial  health  in  the 
early  1990s,  by  the  end  of  1995  the  SS-150  and  the  SS-300  had 
not  passed  the  initial  stages  of  development,  and  the  SS-1000 
had  not  even  been  designed. 

In  the  mid-1980s,  the  armed  forces  became  frustrated  by 
delays  in  the  development  of  self-guided  missiles.  Following  the 
June  1986  meeting  between  private  industry  and  the  military,  a 
consensus  was  reached  that  standardization  in  missile  produc- 
tion was  necessary.  As  a  result,  a  new  firm,  Orbital  Aerospace 
Systems,  Inc.  (Orbita  Sistemas  Aerospaciais  S.A.),  was  created 


459 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

in  February  1987  to  coordinate  Brazil's  missile  program.  Orbita 
was  tasked  with  developing  guided  missiles,  rockets,  and  satel- 
lite launchers  for  civilian  applications.  Orbita,  however,  col- 
lapsed in  the  early  1990s  because  of  inadequate  funding, 
technological  constraints,  and  restrictions  placed  by  the  United 
States  and  other  MTCR  signatories  on  the  transfer  of  sensitive 
technology  to  Brazil. 

By  mid-1997,  therefore,  Brazil  could  be  placed  in  a  fourth 
tier  of  ballistic  missile  producers.  The  first  tier  includes  the 
United  States  and  Russia,  which  have  ICBMs.  The  second  com- 
prises nations  such  as  France,  China,  Britain,  and  Israel,  which 
have  ballistic  missiles  of  more  limited  range  and  accuracy.  A 
third  group  includes  developing  countries,  such  as  Iraq,  India, 
and  South  Africa,  which  have  advanced  missile  programs  with 
modest  ranges.  A  fourth  category  includes  countries  such  as 
Argentina,  Brazil,  Egypt,  Pakistan,  and  South  Korea,  which 
have  artillery  rockets  and  embryonic  ballistic  missile  capabili- 
ties. Brazil's  capabilities  clearly  pale  in  comparison  with  those 
of  the  first  two  tiers  and  are  even  modest  when  compared  with 
those  in  the  third  tier.  Nonetheless,  its  programs  indicate  that  it 
aspires  to  a  third-  and  perhaps  a  second-tier  status.  Finally,  it 
should  be  noted  that  Brazil's  space  and  missile  capabilities  are 
sophisticated  in  relation  to  those  of  most  developing  nations. 
In  summary,  Brazil's  ballistic  missile  program,  which  faces  for- 
midable constraints,  is  largely  in  the  preplanning  stages  and 
not  engaged  in  serious  research  and  development.

The  main  source  of  information  about  Brazilian  science  is 
Fernando  de  Azevedo's  As  ciencias  no  Brasil,  a  collection  of 
essays  written  by  leading  Brazilian  scientists  in  the  early  1950s. 
Simon  Schwartzman's  A  Space  for  Science:  The  Development  of  the 
Scientific  Community  in  Brazil  is  a  sociological  interpretation  of 
the  institutionalization  of  scientific  and  technological  activities 
in  the  country.  It  is  based  on  extensive  interviews  with  leading 
scientists  and  a  review  of  written  sources.  Science  and  Technology 
in  Brazil  by  Schwartzman  et  al  discusses  the  need  for  a  strategic 
role  by  science  and  technology  in  Brazil. 

A  few  key  institutions  have  been  the  subject  of  detailed  stud- 
ies that  have  illuminated  the  social,  economic,  and  political  cli- 
mate of  the  times.  Noteworthy  are  those  on  the  Ouro  Preto 
School  of  Mines  (Escola  de  Minas  de  Ouro  Preto)  in  the  nine-

teenth  century  and  on  the  Oswaldo  Cruz  Foundation  in  the 
early  twentieth  century.  Most  institutional  histories,  however, 
are  just  laudatory  tales  of  names  and  achievements  and  have  lit- 
tle analytical  content.  Works  on  the  Brazilian  Association  for 
the  Progress  of  Sciences  appeared  in  1987  and  1990  by  Ana 
Maria  Fernandes  and  Antonio  Jose  Botelho,  respectively.  The 
association's  journals,  Ciencia  e  Cultura  and  Ciencia  Hoje,  are 
important  repositories  of  historical  and  contemporary  infor- 
mation. 

The  ambitious  project  of  technological  development  since 
the  1970s  has  generated  several  analytical  and  comparative 
studies  from  economic  and  political  perspectives.  Emanuel 
Alder  has  compared  the  computer  and  nuclear  policies  in  Bra- 
zil with  those  in  Argentina,  linking  their  different  results  with 
the  ideologies  and  social  groups  behind  these  policies.  For  the 
broad  policies,  see  the  writings  of  Fabio  Stefano  Erber;  for  the 
computer  industry,  see  Paulo  Bastos  Tigre.  The  main  source 
for  publications  on  the  economic  dimensions  of  scientific  and 
technological  policies  in  Brazil  is  the  Applied  Economic 
Research  Institute  (Instituto  de  Pesquisa  Economica  Apli- 
cada — IPEA),  an  agency  of  Brazil's  Ministry  of  Planning.  The 
ministry  also  publishes  Revista  de  Pesquisa  e  Planejamento 
Econdmico.  The  Brazilian  Science  and  Technology  Policy 
Project,  conducted  by  the  Getulio  Vargas  Foundation  in  Sao 
Paulo  in  1993,  has  published  about  forty  studies  on  different 
aspects  of  Brazilian  science  and  technology  through  the  Edi- 
tora  da  Fundacao  Getulio  Vargas  in  Rio  de  Janeiro. 

A  series  of  working  papers  resulted  from  three  science  and 
technology  policy  studies  carried  out  in  Brazil  in  1993  and 
1994,  with  the  support  of  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technol- 
ogy, the  World  Bank,  the  Inter-American  Development  Bank, 
and  the  UNDP  (United  Nations  Development  Programme). 
One  of  the  studies  was  carried  out  at  the  University  of  Campi- 
nas under  the  coordination  of  Luciano  G.  Coutinho.  It  focused 
on  the  conditions  and  possibilities  for  strengthening  Brazil's 
industrial  competitiveness.  A  second  study  under  the  coordina- 
tion of  Francisco  Biato  was  a  joint  project  of  the  Ministry  of  Sci- 
ence and  Technology,  the  Brazilian  Academy  of  Sciences,  and 
the  UNDP.  The  third  science  and  technology  study  was  con- 
ducted at  the  Getulio  Vargas  Foundation  under  the  coordina- 
tion of  Simon  Schwartzman,  with  the  support  of  the  Ministry  of 
Science  and  Technology  and  the  World  Bank.  The  program  of 
science  and  technology  at  the  University  of  Sao  Paulo  has  pub-

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

lished  a  series  of  books  on  the  management  of  science  and 
technology  research  units  and  related  subjects,  with  a  special 
emphasis  on  the  private  sector. 

Brazil's  nuclear  programs  have  received  considerable  aca- 
demic and  journalistic  attention.  The  most  insightful  analysis  is 
provided  by  Etel  Solingen  in  her  various  journal  articles  and  in 
her  book,  Industrial  Policy,  Technology,  and  International  Bargain- 
ing: Designing  Nuclear  Industries  in  Argentina  and  Brazil.  Some  of 
the  most  vociferous  critics  of  Brazil's  nuclear  development  are 
Brazilians  themselves.  Luiz  Pinguelli  Rosa,  a  nuclear  scientist 
who  was  a  major  opponent  of  the  Brazilian-German  nuclear 
accord,  criticizes  the  role  of  Brazil's  military  in  nuclear  devel- 
opment in  A  politica  nuclear  e  o  caminho  das  armas  atomicas.  Fre- 
derico  Fullgraf  provides  critical  and  historical  analysis  in  A 
bomba  pacifica:  0  Brasil  e  a  corrida  nuclear.  Tania  Malheiros,  a 
journalist,  offers  a  provocative  account  of  Brazil's  nuclear  pro- 
gram in  Brazil,  a  bomba  oculta:  0  programa  nuclear  brasileiro. 

Brazil's  space  program  has  received  much  less  attention  than 
its  nuclear  programs.  Steven  M.  Flank  provides  an  excellent 
comparative  analysis  in  his  Ph.D.  dissertation  "Reconstructing 
Rockets:  The  Politics  of  Developing  Military  Technology  in 
Brazil,  India,  and  Israel."  Brian  G.  Chow  examines  the  difficul- 
ties in  attaining  space-launching  capabilities  in  An  Evolutionary 
Approach  to  Space  Launch  Commercialization.  Pericles  Gasparini 
Alves  assesses  Brazil's  space  program  in  "Access  to  Outer  Space 
Technologies:  Implications  for  International  Security."  (For

Glossary 


adelantado — In  the  sixteenth  century,  the  Spanish  crown 
awarded  the  office  of  adelantado  to  selected  individuals 
who,  at  their  own  expense,  undertook  the  discovery  and 
conquest  of  new  overseas  territories.  Adelantados  served  as 
executive  officers  to  govern  a  region,  to  act  as  head  of  mil- 
itary forces  at  distant  frontier  posts,  or  to  command  a  mili- 
tary expedition. 

Alliance  for  Progress — Established  in  1961  at  a  hemispheric 
meeting  in  Punta  del  Este,  Uruguay,  under  the  leadership 
of  President  John  F.  Kennedy  as  a  long-range  program  to 
help  develop  and  modernize  Latin  American  states 
through  multisector  reforms,  particularly  in  health  and 
education.  Involved  various  forms  of  foreign  aid,  includ- 
ing development  loans  offered  at  very  low  or  zero  interest 
rates,  from  the  United  States  to  all  states  of  Latin  America 
and  the  Caribbean,  except  Cuba. 

Andean  Group — An  economic  group,  the  Andean  Common 
Market,  created  in  1969  by  Bolivia,  Chile,  Colombia,  Ecua- 
dor, Peru,  and  Venezuela  as  a  subregional  market  to 
improve  its  members'  bargaining  power  within  the  Latin 
American  Free  Trade  Association  (LAFTA)  and  to  encour- 
age increased  trade  and  more  rapid  development.  LAFTA, 
which  dated  from  1960,  was  replaced  in  1980  by  the  Latin 
American  Integration  Association  (Asociacion  Lati- 
noamericana  de  Integration — ALADI),  which  advocated  a 
regional  tariff  preference  for  goods  originating  in  member 
states.  Chile  left  the  Andean  Group  in  1976.  The  threat 
that  Peru  might  withdraw  from  the  pact  had  receded  by 
August  1992. 

audiencia — A  high  court  of  justice,  exercising  some  administra- 
tive and  executive  functions  in  the  colonial  period. 

balance  of  payments — An  annual  statistical  summary  of  the 
monetary  value  of  all  economic  transactions  between  one 
country  and  the  rest  of  the  world,  including  goods,  ser- 
vices, income  on  investments,  and  other  financial  matters, 
such  as  credits  or  loans. 

bandeirantes — Colonial  Portuguese  expeditions  made  up  of 
adventurers,  named  after  the  Portuguese  word  for  flag 
(bandeira)  because  they  traveled  under  the  bandeira  of

their  leader,  who  took  with  him  kin,  friends,  slaves,  and 
friendly  Amerindians. 

campesino — A  Latin  American  Indian  farmer  or  farm  laborer. 

capital  goods — A  factor  of  production  category  consisting  of 
manufactured  products  used  in  the  process  of  production. 

Carta  di  Lavoro — This  electoral  model  involves  "functional  rep- 
resentation" by  corporate  groups;  that  is,  instead  of  having 
direct  elections  for  the  national  legislature  by  districts  or 
by  proportional  representation,  elections  are  indirect 
within  corporate  management  and  labor  unions. 

central  bank — Usually  a  federal  government-related  institution 
that  is  entrusted  with  control  of  the  commercial  banking 
system  and  with  the  issuance  of  the  currency.  Responsible 
for  setting  the  level  of  credit  and  money  supply  in  an  econ- 
omy and  serving  as  the  banker  of  last  resort  for  other 
banks.  Also  has  a  major  impact  on  interest  rates,  inflation, 
and  economic  output. 

clientelism — Personal  relationships  that  link  patrons  and  cli- 
ents together  in  a  system  in  which  jobs,  favors,  and  protec- 
tion are  exchanged  for  labor,  support,  and  loyalty. 

"coattails" — The  process  whereby  presidential  candidates  trans- 
fer votes  and  "pull  in"  candidates  of  the  same  party  or  coa- 
lition who  are  running  for  governor,  senator,  and  so  forth. 
Thus,  "reverse  coattails"  occurs  when  candidates  for  gover- 
nor, senator,  and  so  forth  transfer  votes  and  "pull  in"  their 
respective  candidates  for  president. 

Common  Market  of  the  South  (Mercado  Comum  do  Sul — Mer- 
cosul) — An  organization  established  on  March  26,  1991, 
when  the  Treaty  of  Asuncion  was  signed  by  Argentina,  Bra- 
zil, Paraguay,  and  Uruguay  for  the  purpose  of  promoting 
regional  economic  cooperation.  Chile  was  conspicuously 
absent  because  of  its  insistence  that  the  other  four  coun- 
tries first  had  to  lower  their  tariffs  to  the  Chilean  level 
before  Chile  could  join.  Mercosul  became  operational  on 
January  1,  1995.  Chile  became  an  associate  member  that 
month  and  agreed  to  join  as  a  full  member  on  June  25, 
1996.  Bolivia  was  admitted  into  Mercosul  in  March  1997. 
Mercosul  is  more  commonly  known  by  its  Spanish  acro- 
nym, Mercosur  (Common  Market  of  the  South — Mercado 
Comun  del  Sur). 

comparative  advantages — The  relative  efficiencies  with  which 
countries  can  produce  a  product  or  service. 

consumer  durables — Consumer  items  or  durable  goods  (q.v.) 


608 


Glossary 

used  for  several  years,  such  as  automobiles,  appliances,  or 
furniture. 

consumer  price  index  (CPI) — A  statistical  measure  of  sustained 
change  in  the  price  level  weighted  according  to  spending 
patterns. 

Contadora  Support  Group — A  diplomatic  initiative  launched 
by  a  January  1983  meeting  on  Contadora  Island  off  the 
Pacific  coast  of  Panama,  by  which  the  "Core  Four"  media- 
tor countries  of  Colombia,  Mexico,  Panama,  and  Venezu- 
ela sought  to  prevent  through  negotiations  a  regional 
conflagration  among  the  Central  American  states  of  Costa 
Rica,  El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  Honduras,  and  Nicaragua. 
The  governments  of  Argentina,  Brazil,  Peru,  and  Uruguay 
formed  the  Contadora  Support  Group  in  1985  in  an  effort 
to  revitalize  the  faltering  talks.  The  Contadora  process  was 
effectively  superseded  by  direct  negotiations  among  the 
Central  American  states. 

coronelismo — Derives  from  the  honorary  title  of  colonel  (coronel; 
pi.,  coroneis)  in  the  National  Guard  that  was  customarily 
conferred  on  a  locally  dominant  political  boss,  usually  a 
substantial  landowner  or  local  justice  of  the  peace.  The 
term  eventually  became  applied  to  local  strongmen  or 
political  bosses,  especially  in  rural  areas  and  particularly  in 
poorer  Northeastern  states.  Coronelismo  thus  was  a  classic 
boss  system  under  which  control  of  patronage  and  minor 
funds  was  centralized  in  the  coronel,  who  would  dispense 
favors  in  return  for  political  loyalty. 

corporatism — The  belief  that  society  was,  as  political  scientist 
Philippe  C.  Schmitter  stated,  made  up  of  "a  natural  hierar- 
chy of  social  groups,  each  with  its  ordained  place  and  its 
own  set  of  perquisite  responsibilities."  As  a  sociopolitical 
philosophy,  corporatism  found  its  most  developed  expres- 
sion in  Italy  under  Benito  Mussolini.  Corporatism  is  anti- 
thetical to  both  Marxist  and  liberal  democratic  political 
ideals.  A  corporatist  would  organize  society  into  industrial 
and  professional  corporations  that  serve  as  organs  of  polit- 
ical representation  within  a  hierarchical,  centralized  polity 
controlled  by  the  state.  A  corporatist  society  is  elitist,  patri- 
monial, authoritarian,  and  statist.  Some  social  science  the- 
orists have  argued  that  Latin  political  tradition  has  had  a 
fundamental  corporatist  feature,  but  others  argue  that  it  is 
but  one  of  many  cultural  influences  in  the  region. 

cruzado — On  February  28,  1986,  the  Brazilian  cruzado,  equal 


609 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

to  1,000  cruzeiros,  was  introduced,  and  the  Cruzado  Plan 
to  fight  inflation  was  announced.  The  new  cruzado 
(cruzado  novo),  equal  to  1,000  old  cruzados,  was  intro- 
duced on  January  15,  1989. 

cruzeiro  (Cr$) — The  old  national  currency,  consisting  of  100 
centavos,  which  replaced  the  mil-reis  on  November  1, 
1942.  The  cruzeiro  novo  was  created  on  February  8,  1967, 
to  replace  the  cruzeiro.  After  August  1968,  the  cruzeiro 
novo  was  adjusted  by  small  amounts  at  frequent  intervals, 
often  every  week  or  two.  On  May  15,  1970,  the  currency 
reverted  to  the  cruzeiro,  which  remained  in  effect  until 
1986  when  it  was  replaced  by  the  cruzado  (q.v.).  The 
cruzeiro  was  reinstituted  on  March  16,  1990. 

cruzeiro  real  (CR$) — On  August  1,  1993,  the  cruzeiro  real, 
equal  to  1,000  cruzeiros,  was  introduced,  as  the  national 
currency.  It  was  replaced  on  July  1,  1994,  by  the  real  {q.v.). 

current  account — Current  account  balance  is  the  difference 
between  (a)  exports  of  goods  and  services  as  well  as 
inflows  of  unrequited  transfers  but  exclusive  of  foreign  aid 
.  and  (b)  imports  of  goods  and  services  as  well  as  all  unre- 
quited transfers  to  the  rest  of  the  world. 

debt  service — Cash  requirement  to  meet  annual  interest  and 
principal  repayment  obligations  on  total  external  debt. 

degredados — Usually  refers  to  minor  Portuguese  criminals 
exiled  to  Brazil  in  the  sixteenth  century  as  their  punish- 
ment. 

dependency  theory — A  theory  that  seeks  to  explain  the  con- 
tinuing problems  of  Latin  American  underdevelopment 
and  political  conflict  by  positing  the  existence  of  an  impe- 
rialistic, exploitative  relationship  between  the  industrial- 
ized countries  and  the  developing  nations  of  Latin 
America  and  other  developing  regions. 

d'Hondt  method — Also  known  as  the  highest-average  method 
of  determining  the  allocation  of  seats  to  political  parties 
after  an  election.  It  was  devised  by  the  Belgian  Victor 
d'Hondt  to  be  used  in  electoral  systems  based  on  propor- 
tional representation.  In  addition  to  Portugal,  the  method 
has  been  adopted  by  Austria,  Belgium,  Finland,  and  Swit- 
zerland. Under  this  method,  voters  do  not  choose  a  candi- 
date but  vote  for  a  party,  each  of  which  has  published  a  list 
of  candidates.  The  party  winning  the  most  votes  in  a  con- 
stituency is  awarded  the  area's  first  seat,  which  goes  to  the 
candidate  at  the  top  of  the  winning  party's  list.  The  total 


610 


Glossary 

vote  of  this  party  is  then  divided  by  two,  and  this  amount  is 
compared  with  the  totals  of  other  parties.  The  party  with 
the  greatest  number  of  votes  at  this  point  receives  the  next 
seat  to  be  awarded.  Each  time  a  party  wins  a  seat,  its  total  is 
divided  by  the  number  of  seats  it  has  won  plus  one.  This 
process  continues  until  all  the  seats  in  a  constituency  are 
awarded.  The  d'Hondt  method  slightly  favors  large  parties. 
Because  there  is  no  minimum  threshold  for  winning  a 
seat,  however,  small  parties  can  also  elect  representatives. 

durable  goods — Goods  or  consumer  durables  (q.v.)  that  have  a 
life  extending  more  than  three  years,  such  as  automobiles, 
appliances,  and  manufacturing  equipment. 

Ecclesiastical  Base  Communities  (Comunidades  Eclesiais  de 
Base — CEBs) — Grassroots  groups  consisting  of  mostly 
poor  Christian  lay  people  through  which  advocates  of  lib- 
eration theology  (q.v.)  mainly  work.  Members  of  CEBs 
meet  in  small  groups  to  reflect  on  scripture  and  discuss  its 
meaning  in  their  lives.  They  are  introduced  to  a  radical 
interpretation  of  the  Bible,  one  employing  Marxist  termi- 
nology to  analyze  and  condemn  the  wide  disparities 
between  the  wealthy  elite  and  the  impoverished  masses  in 
most  underdeveloped  countries.  This  reflection  often 
leads  members  to  organize  and  improve  their  living  stan- 
dards through  cooperatives  and  civic-improvement 
projects. 

Economic  Commission  for  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean 
(ECLAC) — A  United  Nations  regional  economic  commis- 
sion established  on  February  25,  1948,  as  the  Economic 
Commission  for  Latin  America  (ECLA).  More  commonly 
known  in  Latin  America  as  Comision  Economica  para 
America  Latina  (CEPAL).  In  1984  ECLAC  expanded  its 
operations  and  title  to  include  the  Caribbean.  Main  func- 
tions are  to  initiate  and  coordinate  policies  aimed  at  pro- 
moting economic  development.  In  addition  to  the 
countries  of  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean,  ECLAC's 
forty-one  members  include  Britain,  Canada,  France,  the 
Netherlands,  Portugal,  Spain,  and  the  United  States. 
There  are  an  additional  five  Caribbean  associate  members. 

elasticity — Usually  refers  to  price  elasticity,  the  ratio  of  the 
responsiveness  of  quantity  demanded,  or  supplied,  to  a 
change  in  price. 

European  Community  (EC — also  commonly  called  the  Com- 
munity)— Established  on  April  8,  1965,  the  EC  comprised 


611 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

three  communities:  the  European  Coal  and  Steel  Commu- 
nity (ECSC),  the  European  Economic  Community  (EEC), 
and  the  European  Atomic  Energy  Community  (Euratom). 
Each  community  was  a  legally  distinct  body,  but  from  1967 
the  communities  shared  common  governing  institutions. 
The  EC  formed  more  than  a  framework  for  free  trade  and 
economic  cooperation;  the  signatories  to  the  treaties  gov- 
erning the  communities  agreed  in  principle  to  integrate 
their  economies  and  ultimately  to  form  a  political  union. 
Belgium,  France,  Italy,  Luxembourg,  the  Netherlands,  and 
the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (West  Germany)  were 
charter  members  of  the  EC.  Britain,  Denmark,  and  Ire- 
land joined  on  January  1,  1973;  Greece  became  a  member 
on  January  1,  1981;  and  Portugal  and  Spain  entered  on 
January  1,  1986.  In  November  1993,  the  EC  was  subsumed 
under  a  new  organization,  the  European  Union  (EU — 
q.u). 

European  Economic  Community  (EEC) — SeeEC. 

European  Union  (EU) — Successor  organization  to  the  Euro- 
pean Community  (EC — q.v.),  officially  established  on 
November  1,  1993,  when  the  Treaty  on  European  Union 
went  into  effect.  The  goal  of  the  EU  is  a  closer  economic 
union  of  its  member  states  and  the  European  Monetary 
Union,  a  greater  unity  in  matters  of  justice  and  domestic 
affairs,  and  the  development  of  a  common  foreign  and 
security  policy.  To  the  members  of  the  EC,  the  EU  added 
Austria,  Finland,  and  Sweden,  effective  January  1,  1995. 

export-led  growth — An  economic  development  strategy  that 
emphasizes  export  promotion  as  the  engine  of  economic 
growth.  Proponents  of  this  strategy  emphasize  the  correla- 
tion between  growth  in  exports  and  growth  in  the  aggre- 
gate economy. 

extreme  poverty — Those  who  live  below  the  poverty  line, 
defined  as  half  or  less  of  the  family  income  needed  for  a 
minimal  level  of  food  and  shelter. 

factors  of  production — Land  (or  natural  resources),  labor,  cap- 
ital goods,  sometimes  entrepreneurship,  and  other 
resources  used  in  the  production  of  goods  and  services. 

fiscal  year  (FY) — Coincides  with  calendar  year. 

General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT) — A  123- 
member  international  organization  created  on  October 
30,  1947,  to  provide  a  continuing  basis  for  nations  to  nego- 
tiate and  regulate  commercial  policies  and  promote  inter- 


612 


Glossary 


national  trade  on  a  nondiscriminatory  basis.  Principal 
activity  multinational  negotiation  for  tariff  reductions.  Sev- 
enth and  last  round  of  negotiations,  held  on  April  15, 
1994,  was  Uruguay  Round,  with  the  aim  of  liberalizing  the 
world  market  and  promoting  intellectual  property.  GATT 
was  subsumed  by  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  on 
January  1,  1995. 

general  price  index  (GPI) — A  statistical  measure  of  sustained 
change  in  the  price  level  (rate  of  inflation)  weighted 
according  to  spending  patterns. 

Gini  index  or  coefficient — A  measure  of  inequality  in  a  coun- 
try's wealth  distribution.  It  contrasts  actual  income  and 
property  distribution  with  perfectly  equal  distribution. 
The  value  of  the  coefficient,  or  index,  can  vary  from  0 
(complete  equality)  to  1  (complete  inequality).  Brazil's 
Gini  index  in  1991  was  0.6366. 

gross  domestic  product  (GDP) — The  broadest  measure  of  the 
total  value  of  goods  and  services  produced  by  the  domestic 
economy  during  a  given  period,  usually  a  year.  GDP  has 
mainly  displaced  a  similar  measurement,  the  gross 
national  product  (GNP — q.u).  GDP  is  obtained  by  adding 
the  value  contributed  by  each  sector  of  the  economy  in  the 
form  of  profits,  compensation  to  employees,  and  deprecia- 
tion (consumption  of  capital).  The  income  arising  from 
investments  and  possessions  owned  abroad  is  not 
included,  hence  the  use  of  the  word  "domestic"  to  distin- 
guish GDP  from  GNP.  Real  GDP  adjusts  the  value  of  GDP 
to  exclude  the  effects  of  price  changes,  allowing  for  mea- 
surement of  actual  yearly  increases  or  decreases  in  output. 
Real  GDP  is  the  value  of  GDP  when  inflation  has  been 
taken  into  account. 

gross  national  product  (GNP) — Total  market  value  of  all  final 
goods  (those  sold  to  the  final  user)  and  services  produced 
by  an  economy  during  a  year,  plus  the  value  of  any  net 
changes  in  inventories.  Measured  by  adding  the  gross 
domestic  product  (GDP — q.v.),  net  changes  in  inventories, 
and  the  income  received  from  abroad  by  residents  less  pay- 
ments remitted  abroad  to  nonresidents.  Real  GNP  is  the 
value  of  GNP  when  inflation  has  been  taken  into  account. 

Henriques — Militia  units  named  after  Henrique  Dias,  a  black 
Brazilian  guerrilla  leader  who  led  black  troops  against  the 
Dutch  in  Pernambuco  in  the  1640s. 

human  development  index  (HDI) — A  measurement  of  human 


613 


Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

progress  introduced  by  the  United  Nations  Development 
Programme  (UNDP)  in  its  Human  Development  Report  1990. 
By  combining  indicators  of  real  purchasing  power,  educa- 
tion, and  health,  the  HDI  provides  a  more  comprehensive 
measure  of  development  than  does  the  GNP  (q.v.)  alone. 

import-substitution  industrialization — An  economic  develop- 
ment strategy  and  a  form  of  protectionism  that  emphasizes 
the  growth  of  domestic  industries  by  restricting  the  impor- 
tation of  specific  manufactured  goods,  often  by  using  tariff 
{q.v.)  and  non tariff  measures,  such  as  import  quotas.  The- 
oretically, capital  would  thus  be  generated  through  savings 
of  foreign-exchange  earnings.  Proponents  favor  the 
export  of  industrial  goods  over  primary  products  and  for- 
eign-exchange considerations.  In  the  post-World  War  II 
period,  import-substitution  industrialization  was  most 
prevalent  in  Latin  America.  Its  chief  ideological  propo- 
nents were  the  Argentine  economist  Raul  Prebisch  and  the 
Economic  Commission  for  Latin  America  (q.v.).  Main 
weaknesses  in  Latin  America:  the  domestic  markets  in  the 
region  were  generally  too  small;  goods  manufactured 
domestically  were  too  costly  and  noncompetitive  in  the 
world  market;  most  states  in  the  region  had  an  insufficient 
variety  of  resources  to  build  a  domestic  industry;  and  most 
were  also  too  dependent  on  foreign  technology. 

indexation — Automatic  adjustment  of  remuneration  in  accor- 
dance with  changes  in  a  specific  price  index. 

informal  economy — Unofficial  or  underground  sector  of  eco- 
nomic activity  beyond  government  regulation  and  taxa- 
tion, to  include  street  vendors,  some  domestic  servants, 
and  unskilled  workers  in  urban  areas. 

Inter-American  Development  Bank  (IADB) — Also  known  as 
Banco  Interamericano  de  Desarrollo  (BID).  A  forty-six- 
member  bank  established  on  December  30,  1959,  to  pro- 
mote economic  and  social  development  in  Latin  America. 

Inter-American  Treaty  of  Reciprocal  Assistance  of  1947.  See  Rio 
Treaty. 

intermediate  goods — Goods  purchased  for  resale  or  for  use  in 
producing  final  goods  for  consumers,  or  inventories  con- 
sisting of  raw  materials,  semifinished  goods,  and  finished 
goods  not  yet  sold  to  the  final  consumer.  The  gross 
national  product  (q.v.)  does  not  include  sales  of  interme- 
diate goods  or  services. 

International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development 


614 


Glossary 

(IBRD) — Formal  name  for  the  World  Bank  Group  (q.v.) 
which  was  conceived  at  the  Bretton  Woods  Conference  on 
July  22,  1944,  and  began  operations  in  June  1946.  Its  pri- 
mary purpose  is  to  provide  technical  assistance  and  loans 
at  market-related  rates  of  interest  to  developing  countries 
at  more  advanced  stages  of  development. 

International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) — Established  on  Decem- 
ber 27,  1945,  the  IMF  began  operating  on  March  1,  1947. 
The  IMF  is  a  specialized  agency  affiliated  with  the  United 
Nations  that  takes  responsibility  for  stabilizing  interna- 
tional exchange  rates  and  payments.  The  IMF's  main  busi- 
ness is  the  provision  of  loans  to  its  members  when  they 
experience  balance  of  payments  difficulties.  These  loans 
often  carry  conditions  that  require  substantial  internal 
economic  adjustments  by  the  recipients.  The  IMF's  capital 
resources  comprise  Special  Drawing  Rights  (a  new  form  of 
international  reserve  assets)  and  currencies  that  the  mem- 
bers pay  under  quotas  calculated  for  them  when  they  join. 
These  resources  are  supplemented  by  borrowing.  In  1995 
the  IMF  had  179  members. 

international  reserves — Some  reserves,  in  the  form  of  gold, 
currencies  of  other  countries,  and  Special  Drawing  Rights, 
that  every  country  holds  to  serve  as  "international  money" 
when  a  nation  faces  balance  of  payments  (q.v.)  difficulties. 

International  Telecommunications  Satellite  Organization 
(Intelsat) — Created  in  1964  under  a  multilateral  agree- 
ment, Intelsat  is  a  nonprofit  cooperative  of  134  countries 
that  jointly  own  and  operate  a  global  communications  sat- 
ellite system. 

Kardecian  spiritualism — Allen  Kardec  (a  pseudonym)  founded 
Kardecism,  a  spiritualist  religion,  in  mid-nineteenth-cen- 
tury France.  Imported  into  Brazil  at  the  end  of  the  nine- 
teenth century,  the  religion  was  adopted  by  members  of 
Brazil's  upper  classes  eager  to  identify  with  French  culture. 
It  centers  on  seances  in  which  the  dead  return  through 
mediums  and  give  the  living  advice. 

Latin  American  Free  Trade  Association  (LAFTA) — A  regional 
group  founded  by  the  Montevideo  Treaty  of  1960  to 
increase  trade  and  foster  development.  LAFTA's  failure  to 
make  meaningful  progress  in  liberalizing  trade  among  its 
members  or  to  move  toward  more  extensive  integration 
prompted  the  leaders  of  five  Andean  states  to  meet  in 
Bogota  in  1966.  This  meeting  led  to  the  creation  in  1969

Brazil:  A  Country  Study 

of  the  Andean  Group  (q.v.) — consisting  of  Bolivia,  Chile, 
Colombia,  Ecuador,  Peru,  and  Venezuela — to  serve  as  a 
subregional  structure  within  LAFTA.  LAFTA  was  replaced 
in  1980  by  the  Latin  American  Integration  Association 
(Asociacion  Latinoamericana  de  Integration — ALADI), 
which  advocated  a  regional  tariff  preference  for  goods 
originating  in  member  states.  ALADI  has  since  declined  as 
a  major  Latin  American  integration  effort  in  favor  of 
regional  efforts,  such  as  the  Common  Market  of  the  South 
(q.v.). 

League  of  Nations — An  international  organization  whose  cove- 
nant arose  out  of  the  Paris  Peace  Conference  in  1919.  It 
was  created  for  the  purpose  of  preserving  international 
peace  and  security  and  promoting  disarmament  by  obli- 
gating nations  to  submit  their  conflicts  to  arbitration,  judi- 
cial settlement,  or  to  the  League  Council  for  consid- 
eration. By  not  signing  the  Treaty  of  Versailles,  the  United 
States  refused  to  join.  Although  the  fifty-three-member 
body  considered  sixty-six  disputes  and  conflicts  between 
1920  and  1939,  it  proved  ineffective  against  German,  Ital- 
ian, Japanese,  and  Soviet  aggression  in  the  1930s.  Formally 
disbanded  in  April  1946,  its  functions  were  transferred  to 
the  United  Nations. 

liberation  theology — An  activist  movement  led  by  Roman  Cath- 
olic clergy  who  trace  their  inspiration  to  Vatican  Council  II 
(1965),  when  some  church  procedures  were  liberalized, 
and  the  Latin  American  Bishops'  Conference  in  Medellin, 
Colombia  (1968),  which  endorsed  greater  direct  efforts  to 
improve  the  lot  of  the  poor.  Advocates  of  liberation  theol- 
ogy— sometimes  referred  to  as  "liberationists" — work 
mainly  through  Ecclesiastical  Base  Communities  (q.v.). 

marginality — A  concept  used  to  explain  the  poor  political,  eco- 
nomic, and  social  conditions  of  individuals  within  a  soci- 
ety, social  classes  within  a  nation,  or  nations  within  the 
larger  world  community.  Refers  often  to  poverty-stricken 
groups  left  behind  in  the  modernization  process.  They  are 
not  integrated  into  the  socioeconomic  system,  and  their 
relative  poverty  increases.  Marginality  is  sometimes 
referred  to  as  dualism  or  the  dual-society  thesis. 

Mercosul — See  Common  Market  of  the  South. 

mestizo  (mestizo)  or  mameluco — Person  of  mixed  racial  origin. 

Missile  Technology  Control  Regime  (MTCR) — A  twenty-five- 
member  organization  established  in  April  1987  to  counter 


616 


Gbssary 

missile  proliferation  by  controlling  the  export  of  key  mis- 
sile technologies  and  equipment. 

moderating  power  (poder  moderador) — The  constitutional  func- 
tion of  the  emperor  during  Brazil's  monarchy  era  to  over- 
see or  moderate  the  political  system  by  intervening  at 
times  of  political  crisis  or  institutional  deadlock.  From  the 
fall  of  the  monarchy  in  1889  to  the  1964  military  coup,  the 
military  assumed  and  delegated  the  moderating  power  on 
an  extra-legal  basis.  Political  scientist  Alfred  A.  Stepan  uses 
the  term  to  describe  the  moderator  model  of  civil-military 
relations  in  the  sense  of  "arbiter." 

monetarists — Advocates  of  monetarism,  an  economic  policy 
based  on  the  control  of  a  country's  money  supply.  Mone- 
tarists assume  that  the  quantity  of  money  in  an  economy 
determines  its  economic  activity,  particularly  its  rate  of 
inflation.  A  rapid  increase  in  the  money  supply  creates  ris- 
ing prices,  resulting  in  inflation.  To  curb  inflationary  pres- 
sures, governments  need  to  reduce  the  supply  of  money 
and  raise  interest  rates.  Monetarists  believe  that  conserva- 
tive monetary  policies,  by  controlling  inflation,  will 
increase  export  earnings  and  encourage  foreign  and 
domestic  investments.  Monetarists  generally  have  sought 
support  for  their  policies  from  the  International  Monetary 
Fund  (q.v.),  the  World  Bank  Group  (q.v.),  and  private 
enterprise,  especially  multinational  corporations. 

nonparticipatory  methodology — Unlike  the  "start  from 
scratch"  methodology  used  in  1987-88  (involving  twenty- 
four  subcommittees,  eight  committees,  including  a  draft- 
ing committee,  two  rounds  of  floor  votes,  and  extensive 
popular  hearings  in  the  committee  stages),  the  nonpartici- 
patory methodology  in  the  constitutional  revision  made  in 
1993-94  was  very  streamlined,  with  no  hearings  or  com- 
mittees. It  involved  only  the  reporter's  reports  article  by 
article,  including  or  excluding  the  proposed  changes,  and 
then  a  floor  vote. 

North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement  (NAFTA) — A  free- 
trade  agreement  comprising  Canada,  Mexico,  and  the 
United  States.  NAFTA  was  approved  by  the  United  States 
House  of  Representatives  in  November  1993.  NAFTA 
exceeds  360  million  consumers,  whose  countries  have  a 
combined  output  of  US$6  trillion. 

Organization  of  American  States  (OAS) — Established  by  the 
Ninth  International  Conference  of  American  States  held

in  Bogota  on  April  30,  1948,  and  effective  since  December 
13,  1951.  Has  served  as  a  major  inter-American  organiza- 
tion to  promote  regional  peace  and  security  as  well  as  eco- 
nomic  and  social  development  in  Latin  America. 
Composed  of  thirty-five  members,  including  most  Latin 
American  states  and  the  United  States  and  Canada.  Deter- 
mines common  political,  defense,  economic,  and  social 
policies  and  provides  for  coordination  of  various  inter- 
American  agencies.  Responsible  for  implementing  the 
Inter-American  Treaty  of  Reciprocal  Assistance  (Rio 
Treaty)  (q.v.),  when  any  threat  to  the  security  of  the  region 
arises. 

personalism — The  dominance  of  a  charismatic  personality  in 
the  political  life  of  a  nation.  Loyalty  is  to  a  political  leader 
rather  than  to  institutions,  organizations,  or  ideals. 

plebiscite — A  device  of  direct  democracy  whereby  the  elector- 
ate can  pronounce,  usually  for  or  against,  some  measure 
put  before  it  by  a  government.  Also  known  as  a  referen- 
dum. 

political  culture — The  orientation  of  the  citizens  of  a  nation 
toward  politics,  and  their  perceptions  of  political  legiti- 
macy and  the  traditions  of  political  practice. 

"popular"  sectors — A  term  similar  to  popular  culture,  referring 
to  the  masses  of  working-class,  underemployed,  and  unem- 
ployed citizens. 

positivism — The  theory  that  genuine  knowledge  is  acquired  by 
science  and  that  metaphysical  speculation  has  no  validity. 
Positivism,  based  largely  on  the  ideas  of  the  French  philos- 
opher Auguste  Comte,  was  adopted  by  many  Latin  Ameri- 
can intellectuals  in  the  late  nineteenth  and  early  twentieth 
centuries. 

primary  goods  or  products — Raw  materials,  such  as  ores,  logs, 
and  agricultural  products,  or  other  products  with  a  high 
content  of  natural  resources. 

primary  sector — Agriculture,  extractive  activities,  and  fishing. 

real  (pi.,  reais;  R$) — On  July  1,  1994,  Brazil's  sixth  currency  in 
nine  years,  the  dollar-linked  real  (pronounced  hay-OW), 
equal  to  2,750  cruzeiro  reais,  replaced  the  cruzeiro  real 
(CR$ — q.v.).  During  the  transition  from  the  cruzeiro  real 
to  the  real,  Real  Value  Units  (Unidades  Reais  de  Valor — 
URVs)  acted  as  a  temporary  currency,  beginning  on 
March  1,  1994,  with  one  URV  equal  to  one  real  or 
CR$2,750.  URVs  began  gradually  replacing  indexes  used

Glossary 


to  adjust  wages,  prices,  taxes,  contracts,  and  interest  and 
utility  rates.  The  URV  was  also  part  of  an  economic  stabili- 
zation plan,  the  RealVhin  (Piano  Real),  under  which  prices 
were  gradually  converted  from  cruzeiro  reals  to  URVs.  The 
URV  is,  by  definition,  the  inflation  rate  itself.  The  URV 
rate  is  calculated  as  the  average  of  a  basket  ( cesta)  of  price 
indexes.  The  fluctuation  band  mechanism  set  by  the  Cen- 
tral Bank  (q.v.)  in  March  1995  provided  for  bank  interven- 
tion in  the  interbank  exchange  markets  whenever  the 
buying  floor  rate  of  R$0.88  per  dollar  and  the  ceiling  sell- 
ing rate  of  R$0.93  per  dollar  were  affected  by  the  market 
rates.  The  Central  Bank  restructured  the  real's  trading  ban 
on  January  15,  1997,  to  a  range  of  1.0430  to  1.0480  per 
dollar,  after  the  currency  fell  through  its  previous  band. 
The  dollar /r^Z  rate  on  April  13,  1998,  was  R$1.140. 

real  exchange  rate — The  value  of  foreign  exchange  corrected 
for  differences  between  external  and  domestic  inflation. 

Rio  Treaty  (Inter-American  Treaty  of  Reciprocal  Assistance) — 
A  regional  alliance,  signed  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  in  1947,  that 
established  a  mutual  security  system  to  safeguard  the  West- 
ern Hemisphere  from  aggression  from  within  or  outside 
the  zone.  Signatories  include  the  United  States  and  twenty 
Latin  American  republics.  In  1975  a  special  conference 
approved,  over  United  States  objections,  a  Protocol  of 
Amendment  to  the  Rio  Treaty  that,  once  ratified,  would 
establish  the  principle  of  "ideological  pluralism"  and 
would  simplify  the  rescinding  of  sanctions  imposed  on  an 
aggressor  party. 

slash-and-burn  agriculture — Method  of  cultivation  whereby 
areas  of  the  forest  are  burned  and  cleared  for  planting,  the 
ash  providing  some  fertilization.  Area  is  cultivated  for  sev- 
eral years  and  then  left  fallow  for  a  decade  or  longer. 
These  practices  by  subsistence  farmers  could  destroy 
almost  half  of  world's  remaining  2.08  billion  hectares  of 
tropical  forests,  according  to  a  study  released  by  Consulta- 
tive Group  on  International  Agricultural  Research 
(CGIAR)  in  August  1996. 

structuralists — Advocates  of  structuralism,  an  economic  policy 
that  blames  chronic  inflation  primarily  on  foreign  trade 
dependency,  insufficient  local  production,  especially  in 
agriculture,  and  political  struggles  among  entrenched 
vested  interests  over  government  contracts.  Structuralists 
advocate  encouraging  economic  development  and  mod-

ernization  through  Keynesian  and  neo-Keynesian  policies 
of  governmental  stimulative  actions,  accompanied  by  orga- 
nizational reforms.  Structuralists  contend  that  monetarist 
(q.v.)  policies  retard  growth  and  support  the  status  quo. 

sustainable  development — Development  that  meets  the  needs 
of  the  present  generation  without  compromising  the  abil- 
ity of  future  generations  to  meet  their  own. 

tariff — A  tax  levied  by  a  government  in  accordance  with  its  tar- 
iff schedule,  usually  on  imported  products,  but  sometimes 
also  on  exported  goods.  May  be  imposed  to  protect 
domestic  industries  from  competitive  imported  goods 
and/or  to  generate  revenue.  Types  include  ad  valorem, 
variable,  or  some  combination. 

tenentismo — A  reform  movement  among  junior  army  officers 
that  began  in  the  early  1920s  and  played  a  significant  role 
in  bringing  Getulio  Dorneles  Vargas  (president,  1930-45, 
1951-54)  to  power. 

terms  of  trade — The  ratio  of  a  country's  index  of  average 
export  prices  and  average  import  prices.  In  international 
economics,  the  concept  of  "terms  of  trade"  plays  an  impor- 
tant role  in  evaluating  exchange  relationships  between 
nations.  The  terms  of  trade  shift  whenever  a  country's 
exports  will  buy  more  or  fewer  imports.  An  improvement 
in  the  terms  of  trade  occurs  when  export  prices  rise  rela- 
tive to  import  prices.  The  terms  of  trade  turn  unfavorable 
in  the  event  of  a  slump  in  export  prices  relative  to  import 
prices. 

Third  Worldism — An  ideology  that  began  in  1947  in  which 
mostly  developing  nations  not  committed  to  either  the 
East  or  the  West  in  the  Cold  War  professed  policies  of 
"neutralism"  and  "nonalignment."  Since  the  1970s,  Latin 
American  states  have  moved  increasingly  from  a  position 
of  political  and  economic  alignment  with  the  United 
States  to  one  of  sympathy  with  Third  Worldism. 

Treaty  of  Tlatelolco — On  being  ratified  by  Cuba  in  April  1995, 
the  treaty  took  effect,  binding  the  thirty-three  Latin  Amer- 
ican and  Caribbean  signatory  nations  to  the  peaceful  use 
of  nuclear  power.  Under  the  treaty,  Latin  America  became 
the  world's  first  region  to  prohibit  nuclear  weapons.  The 
treaty  covers  all  of  Latin  America,  including  the  Carib- 
bean, from  the  Mexican  border  with  the  United  States  to 
Antarctica.  It  bans  the  testing,  use,  manufacture,  produc- 
tion, or  acquisition  of  nuclear  weapons.  Each  participating

country  must  negotiate  accords  with  the  International 
Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA)  to  facilitate  verification. 

Treaty  of  Tordesillas — Under  a  papal  bull  issued  in  1493,  Spain 
was  awarded  lands  west  and  south  of  the  line  of  demarca- 
tion, and  Portugal  received  lands  east  and  south.  Dissatis- 
fied with  this  arrangement,  however,  Portugal  and  Spain 
concluded  the  Treaty  of  Tordesillas  of  June  4,  1494,  to 
establish  a  new  line  of  demarcation  370  leagues  west  of  the 
Cape  Verde  Islands,  placing  all  of  Africa,  India,  and  later, 
Brazil,  within  Portugal's  sphere. 

United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP) — A  thirty- 
six-member  organization,  established  on  November  22, 
1965,  to  provide  technical  assistance  to  stimulate  eco- 
nomic and  social  development. 

value-added  tax  (VAT) — An  incremental  tax  applied  to  the 
value  added  at  each  stage  of  the  processing  of  a  raw  mate- 
rial or  the  production  and  distribution  of  a  commodity.  It 
is  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  product  value 
at  a  given  stage  and  the  cost  of  all  materials  and  services 
purchased  as  inputs.  The  value-added  tax  is  a  form  of  indi- 
rect taxation,  and  its  impact  on  the  ultimate  consumer  is 
the  same  as  that  of  a  sales  tax. 

vertical  integration — Merging  into  a  single  ownership  of  firms 
producing  in  successive  stages  of  a  production  process, 
whether  it  be  forward  toward  the  finished  goods  market  or 
backward  toward  raw  material  producers. 

World  Bank — Informal  name  used  to  designate  the  World 
Bank  Group  of  four  affiliated  international  institutions: 
the  International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Develop- 
ment (IBRD — q.v.),  the  International  Development  Associ- 
ation (IDA),  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC), 
and  the  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency 
(MIGA).  The  IBRD,  established  in  1945,  has  the  primary 
purpose  of  providing  loans  to  developing  countries  for 
productive  projects.  The  IDA,  a  legally  separate  loan  fund 
administered  by  the  staff  of  the  IBRD,  was  established  in 
1960  to  furnish  credits  to  the  poorest  developing  countries 
on  much  easier  terms  than  those  of  conventional  IBRD 
loans.  The  IFC,  founded  in  1956,  supplements  the  activi- 
ties of  the  IBRD  through  loans  and  assistance  designed 
specifically  to  encourage  the  growth  of  productive  private 
enterprises  in  less  developed  countries.  MIGA,  founded  in 
1988,  insures  private  foreign  investment  in  developing

countries  against  various  noncommercial  risks.  The  presi- 
dent and  certain  senior  officers  of  the  IBRD  hold  the  same 
positions  in  the  IFC.  The  four  institutions  are  owned  by 
the  governments  of  the  countries  that  subscribe  their  capi- 
tal. To  participate  in  the  World  Bank  Group,  member 
states  must  first  belong  to  the  IMF  (q.v.).  In  1995  the 
World  Bank  included  178  member-countries.  By  the  early 
1990s,  the  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  region  had 
received  more  loan  aid  through  the  World  Bank  Group 
than  any  other  region, 
yellow  cake — The  U308  uranium  concentrate  used  by  nuclear 
power  plants  in  Angra  dos  Reis  in  Rio  de  Janeiro  State.  It  is 
a  radioactive  substance  made  from  a  low-grade  uranium 
ore.
