SLIP-AND-FALL  ACCIDENTS  DURING  EQUIPMENT  MAINTENANCE 
IN  THE  SURFACE  MINING  INDUSTRY 


By  Thomas  J.  Albin1  and  W.  P.  Adams2 


ABSTRACT 

This  U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines  report  identifies  potential  causes  of  slip-and-fall  accidents  occurring  during 
surface  mine  equipment  maintenance  and  describes  the  relative  roles  of  direct  worker  behavior  and 
machine  design.  The  relative  roles  of  human  behavior  and  machine  design  in  the  causation  of  slip-and- 
fall  accidents  were  determined  through  analysis  of  accident  records,  observations  of  maintenance  worker 
behavior,  and  evaluation  of  mine  machinery.  From  these  data,  relative  risk  ratios  were  calculated. 
Behavior  had  a  relative  risk  ratio  of  1.5;  machine  design,  specifically  access  systems  design,  had  a  relative 
risk  ratio  of  2.2.  Of  the  access  systems,  ladders  had  the  highest  relative  risk  ratio,  7.0.  This  study 
suggests  that  accident  intervention  would  be  most  profitably  made  in  improving  the  design  of  systems 
used  to  access  maintenance  worker  areas  of  mining  equipment.

INTRODUCTION 


PROBLEM  DESCRIPTION 

Recent  research  conducted  by  the  U.S.  Bureau  of 
Mines  has  shown  that  accidents  occurring  during  main- 
tenance of  mining  equipment  constituted  34  pet  of  all 
surface  mining  accidents  from  1978  to  1984  (i).3  Does  this 
mean  that  maintenance  is  more  hazardous  than  other  min- 
ing activity?  During  1986,  the  only  year  for  which  demo- 
graphic data  regarding  miners  are  available,  there  were  an 
estimated  27,864  maintenance  workers  in  the  surface 
mining  industry  (2-3).  Although  these  workers  accounted 
for  only  6.7  pet  of  all  hours  worked,  they  were  involved  in 
16.8  pet  of  all  surface  mining  accidents  (4).  Based  on 
these  estimates,  it  appears  that  maintenance  is  2-1/2  times 
more  hazardous  than  other  surface  mining  activities. 

Contemporary  mining  equipment  is  quite  large,  and 
maintenance  workers  must  move  about  on  it  to  perform 
their  jobs.  A  large  part  of  their  work  is  performed  in  the 
presence  of  fluids,  fuels,  and  lubricants.  Dusts,  ore 
particles,  and  other  associated  debris  may  also  degrade 
surface  footing  properties.  All  of  these  substances  put 
maintenance  workers  at  risk  for  slips  and  falls.  Bureau 
research  found  that  slip-and-fall  accidents  constitute 
approximately  20  pet  of  all  surface  mining  maintenance 
accidents. 

Slip-and-fall  accidents,  as  a  group,  are  more  severe  than 
are  other  mining  accidents.  A  standard  definition  of 
accident  severity,  as  used  by  the  U.S.  Mine  Safety  and 
Health  Administration  (MSHA),  is  the  sum  of  the  lost 
workdays  plus  the  statutory  number  of  penalty  days 
assessed  to  each  accident  plus  one-half  the  restricted  duty 
workdays.  One  study  found  the  average  accident  severity 
for  all  surface  mining  accidents  to  be  18.5  days  compared 
with  33  days  for  slip-and-fall  accidents  (5).  Thus  slips  and 
falls,  as  20  pet  of  all  maintenance  accidents  with  an 
average  severity  1.8  times  the  average,  account  for  36  pet 
of  all  maintenance  accident  severity. 

Slips  and  falls  are  clearly  an  important  safety  problem 
that  costs  individuals  and  mine  operating  companies 
dearly.  The  individual  endures  both  the  economic  and 
physical  costs  of  the  accident,  while  the  operating  company 
endures  increased  insurance  costs  and  losses  in  produc- 
tivity. It  has  been  estimated  that  the  average  direct  cost 
per  case  of  all  surface  mining  accidents  is  $14,000  (<5).  If 
the  relationship  between  accident  severity  and  accident 
cost  is  linear,  then  an  average  slip-and-fall  accident  has  an 
associated  cost  1.8  times  the  overall  average,  or  $25,200. 
This  estimate  is  based  on  (1)  loss  in  personal  income,  (2) 
compensation  of  wages,  (3)  death  and  disability  benefits, 
(4)  medical  costs,  (5)  postaccident  losses  as  a  result  of 
fatality  or  amputation,  and  (6)  investigation  of  a  fatal 
accident  (6).  The  estimate  does  not  include  the  costs 
of  (1)  loss  of  life,  (2)  fines,  (3)  lawsuits,  (4)  loss  of 

Italic  numbers  in  parentheses  refer  to  items  in  the  list  of  references 
preceding  the  appendix  at  the  end  of  this  report. 


equipment,  (5)  productivity  losses  due  to  workplace  dis- 
ruption, (6)  productivity  losses  due  to  temporary  or 
permanent  shutdowns,  (7)  productivity  losses  due  to 
inexperienced  replacement  workers,  or  (8)  long-term 
followup  medical  or  rehabilitation  treatment  (6). 

The  expected  loss  to  a  mining  operator  in  a  given  time 
period  can  be  estimated.  During  the  first  6  months  of 
1987,  individuals  employed  in  all  sectors  of  surface  mining 
operations,  including  coal,  metal-nonmetal,  and  sand  and 
gravel,  with  their  associated  plants  and  mills,  worked  a 
total  of  398,179,605  h  (7).  During  the  same  time  period, 
1,163  slip-and-fall  accidents  occurred  in  these  same 
operations  (7).  The  expected  incidence  rate  of  slip- and- fall 
accidents  per  any  given  unit  of  time  may  be  obtained  from 
these  data  by  division.  It  is  the  usual  practice  to  base  the 
incidence  rate  on  the  number  of  accidents  per  100  work 
years,  where  a  work  year  is  defined  as  2,000  h  worked  (one 
full-time  equivalent)  (7).  Using  this  method,  the  expected 
incidence  rate  of  slip-and-fall  accidents  in  surface  mining 
is  0.58  incidents  per  year  per  100  full-time  equivalents. 
(An  alternative  method  for  estimating  incidence  rates  is 
described  in  reference  8.)  The  minimal  expected  cost  of 
a  slip-and-fall  accident  per  100  full-time  equivalents  is  the 
product  of  the  probability  of  a  slip-and-fall  accident  (0.58), 
times  the  linearly  estimated  cost  of  a  slip-and-fall  accident 
($25,200),  or  $14,616.  Thus,  each  surface  mining  operation 
should  expect  to  incur  approximately  $15,000  in  costs  be- 
cause of  slip-and-fall  accidents  per  100  full-time  employees 
annually. 

This  $15,000  cost  figure  can  be  used  to  "bench  mark" 
intervention  efforts  aimed  at  preventing  or  decreasing  the 
rate  of  slip-and-fall  accidents.  As  an  example,  assume  a 
mine  with  100  full-time  employees  is  contemplating  spend- 
ing $20,000  in  permanent  improvements  that  would  de- 
crease slip-and-fall  accidents  by  50  pet.  This  is  an  initial 
investment  of  $20,000  and  a  reduced  expected  annual  cost 
of  $7,500  (15,000  x  0.5).  The  expected  payback  period  is 
2.67  years,  calculated  by  dividing  $20,000  by  $7,500  per 
year  (9). 

However,  this  example  assumes  that  the  miner  has 
some  knowledge  of  the  causes  of  slip-and-fall  accidents 
prior  to  addressing  them,  knowledge  of  the  effect  on  the 
slip-and-fall  incidence  rate  of  remediating  them  once  they 
are  identified,  and  an  idea  of  the  cost  of  implementing  the 
remediative  measures.  While  the  last  might  be  estimated 
with  accuracy,  the  first  two  are  less  well  studied  in  surface 
mining. 

PROBLEM  BACKGROUND 

Remediation  of  the  causes  of  slip-and-fall  accidents  re- 
quires knowledge  of  the  kinds  of  causes  and  their  nature. 
In  a  general  discussion  of  accident  safety,  two  diametrically 
opposed  explanations  of  accident  causation  are  given.  The 
first  of  these  is  that  "stupid,  careless,  negligent  people  are 


the  cause  of  90  pet  of  all  accidents  and  that  the  tools, 
machinery,  or  processes  should  not  even  be  considered  as 
being  primary  potential  causes"  (11).  The  other  extreme 
explanation  blames  poorly  designed  products  as  the  cause 
of  accidents.  The  belief  is  that  products  should  be  so 
designed  that,  even  in  the  presence  of  untrained  careless 
persons,  the  product  will  have  human  fail-safe  procedures 
features  that  will  provide  protection  for  persons  from  their 
own  errors  and  negligence  (10).  While  these  two  oppo- 
sites  are  recognized  as  extremes,  they  serve  a  heuristic 
purpose:  To  what  extent  are  individual  behavior  and 
machine  design  involved  as  risk  factors  in  slip-and-fall 
accidents  in  surface  mining  maintenance? 

A  study  done  by  MSHA  in  1985  analyzing  ladder  falls 
from  off-road  haul  trucks  stated  that  "safe  ladder  systems 
are  needed  to  prevent  men  from  falling;  however,  in- 
sufficient training  and  unsafe  work  practices  appear  to  be 
major  causes  of  injuries  associated  with  haul  truck  ladder 
systems"  (11).  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  researchers  were 
unable  to  classify  65  pet  of  the  accidents  as  to  probable 
cause.  Unsafe  work  habits  were  defined  in  this  study  as 
(1)  missing  a  step,  (2)  carrying  articles,  (3)  jumping  from 
the  ladder,  (4)  catching  clothing  or  ring  on  a  step  or 
handrail,  (5)  not  using  the  handrail,  (6)  falling  from  a 
moving  truck  and,  (7)  facing  away  from  the  ladder.  While 
the  classification  of  some  of  these  behaviors  might  be 
debated,  the  import  remains,  individuals  engage  in  risky 
behavior  in  the  job  environment. 

Risk  may  be  defined  logically  as  the  expected  loss  re- 
sultant from  a  chosen  alternative  behavior  (12),  and  it  may 
be  further  divided  into  objective  and  subjective  risk  that 
often  differ  (13).  Objective  risk  is  the  verbally  expressed 
level  of  risk,  i.e.,  "it  is  unsafe  to  climb  a  ladder  while 
carrying  an  object  in  my  hands,"  versus  the  subjective  risk 
assessment,  i.e.,  "I've  carried  this  part  up  this  way  a 
hundred  times  before  without  any  problem."  Behavior 
clearly  plays  a  role  in  slip-and-fall  accidents,  and  risk 
perception  logically  plays  an  important  role  in  behavior. 

Previous  work  by  the  Bureau  on  slip-and-fall  accidents 
during  maintenance  has  focused  on  the  design  of  access 
systems  (such  as  ladders,  steps  and  stairs,  and  walkways) 
for  mining  machines  (14).  Serious  design  problems, 
particularly  the  height  of  the  first  step  off  the  ground,  were 
identified  and  remediative  devices  were  developed. 


Risk  behaviors  associated  with  slip-and-fall  accidents 
are,  currently,  not  well  described.  Some  are  well  known, 
i.e.,  descending  a  ladder  facing  outwards,  but  there  are 
likely  others  as  yet  unidentified.  In  addition,  the  risk 
associated  with  these  behaviors  has  not  been  directly 
assessed.  Similarly,  machine  design  problems  have  typi- 
cally been  ascribed  to  existing  access  systems,  i.e.,  the 
height  of  the  first  ladder  step  above  the  ground,  but  it  is 
not  clear  if  other  design  problems  exist. 

It  is  apparent  that  remediation  of  slip-and-fall  accidents 
will  be  necessary.  It  is  also  apparent  that  both  behavior, 
including  risk  perception,  and  machine  design  are  probable 
causes  of  such  accidents,  but  that  their  relative  importance 
is  unclear.  It  is  important  to  understand  their  relative 
causal  roles  in  order  to  develop  effective  remediation 
strategies  that  will  prevent  or  decrease  slip-and-fall 
accidents. 

OBJECTIVES 

This  research  is  part  of  the  Bureau's  program  to  en- 
hance the  health  and  safety  of  mine  maintenance  workers. 
There  are  two  major  objectives  of  this  study.  The  first  is 
to  develop  a  description  of  antecedent  events  to  slip-and- 
fall  accidents  that  occur  during  the  maintenance  of  surface 
mining  equipment.  The  second  is  to  determine  the  relative 
roles  of  behavior  and  machine  design  in  slip-and-fall  ac- 
cident causation.  These  objectives  will  be  accomplished 
through  analysis  of  accident  record  narratives  and  field 
data. 

The  description  of  behavior  included  identification  and 
description  of  specific  risk  behaviors,  estimation  of  the 
proportion  of  all  behavior  that  the  identified  risk  behaviors 
constitute,  and  finally,  empirical  estimates  of  risk  resultant 
to  the  behaviors. 

Machine  design  was  assessed  both  by  compliance  of  ac- 
cess system  design  with  the  guidelines  for  access  systems 
of  off-road  equipment  described  in  the  Society  of  Automo- 
tive Engineers  Standard  SAE  J 185  (15)  and  by  the  evalua- 
tion of  sufficiency  and  adequacy  of  existing  access  systems 
as  determined  through  the  analysis  of  accident  records. 
Empirical  estimates  of  the  relative  risk  of  various  access 
system  elements  were  developed. 


METHOD 


ACCIDENT  RECORD  ANALYSIS 

Accident  records,  including  a  short  narrative  description 
of  the  accident,  were  obtained  from  the  MSHA  data  base 
through  use  of  the  Bureau's  Accident  Data  Analysis 
(ADA)  program.  These  accident  records  were  drawn  from 
the  surface  mining  industry,  which  includes  coal,  metal  and 
nonmetal,  and  aggregate  mines.  All  slip-and-fall  accidents 
involving  surface  mine  maintenance  workers  in  the  years 
1985, 1986,  and  the  first  half  of  1987  were  analyzed.  These 


were  the  most  recent  data  available  at  the  time  of  compila- 
tion. A  total  of  1,381  accident  records  were  obtained. 
Based  on  1986  estimates  (2-3),  these  records  pertain  to 
18,362  mines  and  27,864  workers. 

The  accident  narratives  were  typically  not  prepared  by 
the  injured  individual.  They  were  most  commonly  prepar- 
ed by  safety  officers,  next  followed  in  frequency  by 
foremen,  and  finally  by  the  injured  individuals.  Some  addi- 
tional caveats  regarding  the  narratives  should  be  noted. 
The  narratives  were  prepared  after  the  fact.  As  such,  their 


accuracy  and  validity  may  be  fairly  questioned.  First,  it  is 
conceivable,  and  even  likely,  that  important  causal  factors 
have  not  been  included  in  some  of  the  narratives.  Second, 
the  reliability  of  the  narratives  may  be  questioned.  Given 
the  free-form  nature  of  the  narrative,  an  individual  might 
note  and  report  widely  differing  narratives  of  highly  similar 
events.  This  problem  is  further  complicated  when  many 
different  individuals  are  reporting  accidents.  Nonetheless, 
these  records  do  contain  information  that  has  an  important 
heuristic  value  for  future  research. 

The  narrative  records  were  read  and  classified  by  a 
single  rater  (Adams)  using  a  prepared  list  of  operationally 


defined  event  codes.  This  rater  is  a  graduate  engineer 
with  approximately  1-year's  experience  in  human  factors. 
In  order  to  assess  rater  reliability,  100  accident  narratives 
were  randomly  drawn  and  classified  by  a  second  rater 
( Albin).  The  codes  for  these  100  records  were  compared 
with  the  codes  prepared  by  Adams.  A  coefficient  of  agree- 
ment (7(5)  of  0.93  (p  <  O.'OOl)  was  obtained. 

Event  codes  and  definitions  were  created  for  any  events 
discovered  in  the  course  of  analysis  that  did  not  fit  events 
defined  in  the  original  list.  The  final  list  of  events  and 
their  definitions  are  presented  in  table  1.

ASSESSMENT  OF  WORKER  BEHAVIOR 

The  analysis  of  accident  narrative  reports  described  in 
the  section  "Accident  Record  Analysis"  was  used  to  de- 
velop a  list  of  direct  worker  behaviors  that  were  antece- 
dent to  slip-and-fall  accidents.  These  behaviors  include 
using  a  ladder  while  carrying  an  object  in  the  hands; 
jumping  from  a  machine;  not  using  an  access  system  when 
one  is  available;  and  not  cleaning  oil,  mud,  etc.  off  of  work 
boots. 

For  the  field  phase  of  the  study,  two  researchers 
observed  maintenance  work  activity  for  a  combined  80  h 
of  observation  time.  During  this  time,  four  maintenance 
workers  were  scheduled  to  be  filmed  while  performing 
their  normal  duties  for  2  h  each  on  2  separate  days  over  a 
period  of  4  days.  Filming  was  done  while  maintenance 
personnel  accessed  front-end  loaders,  bulldozers,  off-road 
haul  trucks,  road  graders,  power  shovels,  and  various 
stationary  machines  such  as  crushers,  etc.  In  actuality, 
much  of  the  maintenance  work  observed  during  these 
filming  periods  took  place  in  areas  that  were  physically 
inaccessible  to  the  camera.  Consequently,  only  about  2  h 
film  was  gathered  on  each  of  the  four  individuals.  One 
individual  at  a  time  was  filmed,  starting  on  the  second  and 
sixth  hours  of  each  shift  in  order  to  control  for  time 
effects.  Both  the  days  when  filming  occurred  and  the 
order  of  filming  during  the  shift  were  randomly  deter- 
mined for  each  individual.  While  the  possibility  of  a 
Hawthorne  effect  exists,  previous  research  has  suggested 
that  such  behavior  changes  are  transient  and  disappear 
after  repeated  observations  (17). 

Behavioral  samples  were  obtained  by  viewing  randomly 
determined  portions  of  1  day's  videotape  of  each  of  the 
four  maintenance  workers  while  they  serviced  mining 
equipment.  The  days  used  were  randomly  selected  for 
each  individual  as  follows.  Each  of  the  four  selected  tapes 
was  numbered  in  sequence.  The  lengths  of  the  selected 
videotapes,  as  indicated  by  the  tape  player's  incremental 
counter,  were  added,  in  order  of  sequence,  to  generate 
a  total  tape  length.  A  BASICA  program  was  written  to 
generate  a  list  of  100  random  numbers  ranging  between 
0  and  1.  Each  of  these  numbers  was  then  multiplied  by 
the  total  tape  length  to  generate  a  point  at  which  the  ob- 
servation was  to  occur.  The  tape  was  then  viewed  at  these 
points.  A  tally  was  made  of  all  instances  where  one  of  the 
high-risk  behaviors  was  observed. 

During  each  day  that  an  individual  maintenance  worker 
was  selected  for  filming,  that  individual  was  under  continu- 
ous observation  by  an  observer.  The  observer  recorded 
information  on  the  relative  proportions  of  time  that 
maintenance  workers  spent  in  various  locations,  including 
various  access  systems.  These  locations  were  (1)  on  a 
ladder,  (2)  on  the  ground,  (3)  on  stairs,  (4)  stationary  on 
a  machine,  (5)  on  a  workstand,  (6)  climbing  on  a  machine 


where  no  prepared  access  existed,  (7)  on  a  walkway, 
(8)  operating  a  machine,  and  (9)  miscellaneous. 

These  worker  location  data  were  collected  continuously 
on  all  four  maintenance  workers  over  the  4-day  period 
using  a  systematic  random  sampling  procedure  (18)  at 
10-min  intervals  after  a  randomly  determined  starting 
point.  These  data  were  recorded  in  a  notebook. 

The  objective  of  this  phase  of  the  study  was  to  estimate 
two  proportions:  the  proportion  of  high-risk  behaviors  and 
the  proportion  of  time  spent  in  various  locations.  The 
estimates  of  these  proportions  were  accomplished  via  a 
work-sampling  technique  (18).  This  method  may  be  used 
to  estimate  the  precision  of  the  estimate  of  a  proportion 
using  equation  1: 


N  =  (p'  (1  -  pO^/D2, 


(1) 


where        N 
P' 


and 


D 


=  number  of  samples  required, 

=  first-guess  estimate  of  the  proportion,' 

=  z-score  for  any  desired  confidence 
interval, 

=  desired  precision  of  the  estimate  of  the 
proportion,  expressed  as  a  decimal  frac- 
tion and  interpreted  as  the  proportion 
plus  or  minus  D  pet. 


While  z  was  specified  prior  to  the  study  as  1.96,  and 
time  constraints  suggested  a  maximum  sample  size,  N,  of 
100,  the  proportion  of  risk  behaviors  was  unknown  at  the 
beginning  of  the  study,  resulting  in  an  unknown  degree 
of  precision.  It  was  decided  to  use  a  conservative  pro- 
cedure (18)  to  estimate  the  precision  for  a  sample  size 
of  100  observations.  This  procedure  consists  of  setting  p' 
equal  to  0.5  and  solving  equation  1  for  D.  Using  this  pro- 
cedure yielded  a  value  of  0.09  for  D.  This  was  considered 
to  be  an  acceptable  level  of  precision,  particularly  as 
the  true  proportion  was  considered  likely  to  be  much  less 
than  0.5,  which  would  result  in  increased  precision  of  the 
estimate  with  a  sample  size  of  100. 

MINING  MACHINE  ACCESS  SYSTEM  ANALYSIS 

Access  systems  of  mobile  mine  equipment  were 
evaluated  for  new  (1988)  and  older  (pre- 1988)  machinery. 
Access  systems  of  the  new  machines  were  evaluated  with 
the  manufacturers'  permission  and  cooperation  at  the  1988 
MINEXPO  show  in  Chicago,  IL.  Of  the  new  off-road 
machines  examined,  three  were  front-end  loaders  and  two 
were  trucks.  These  machines  are  a  reasonable  representa- 
tion of  equipment  that  would  be  found  in  a  surface  mine, 
with  the  notable  exception  of  power  shovels. 


Of  the  older  machines  evaluated  at  a  cooperating  min- 
ing operation,  two  were  front-end  loaders  and  two  were 
off-road  haul  trucks.  All  machines  were  evaluated  for 
compliance  with  the  recommended  access  system  design 
guidelines  published  by  SAE  (15).  Scoring  sheets  were 
constructed  for  this  evaluation,  which  depicted  different 
access  system  components  and  the  relevant  dimension  lines 
of  each.  Each  relevant  dimension  of  the  access  system, 
e.g.,  ladder  width,  was  given  a  letter  code.  The  evaluator 
recorded  the  site  of  any  particular  access  system 
component  on  the  machine,  e.g.,  cab  access,  and  the 
measurements  appropriate  to  that  particular  access  system 
element  by  letter  code  on  the  sheet.  A  sample  scoring 
sheet  is  shown  in  figure  1. 

Dimensions  for  each  access  system  element  were  scored 
to  indicate  compliance  with  the  SAE  J185  standard.  The 
SAE  J185  standard  gives  minimum,  maximum,  and  rec- 
ommended dimensions  for  each  access  system  element. 
If  the  access  system  of  a  machine  was  within  10  pet, 
plus  or  minus,  of  the  recommended  dimension,  it  was 
given  a  score  of  1.  An  access  system  element  whose 
dimensions  were  between  the  maximum  and  minimum 
given  in  SAE  J185  but  not  within  a  10-pct  range  of  the 
recommended  dimension  was  given  a  score  of  2.  An 
access  system  element  whose  dimensions  were  outside  the 
maximum  or  minimum  values  was  given  a  score  of  3. 
Each  access  system  component  was  given  a  composite 
score,  which  was  the  arithmetic  average  of  its  subelements' 
scores,  i.e.,  the  score  for  a  ladder  would  be  the  average  of 
the  score  for  step  width,  handrail  diameter,  etc. 

RESULTS 

A  complete  listing  of  antecedent  events,  their  associated 
codes,  and  the  frequency  with  which  they  were  noted  in 
the  accident  records  is  presented  in  table  2.  The  total 
number  of  events  exceeds  the  number  of  accidents  because 
some  accidents  had  more  than  one  antecedent  event  noted. 

Direct  Worker  Behavior 

Direct  volitional  behavior  of  the  individual  involved  in  an 
accident  was  noted  in  8.9  pet  of  all  accident  narratives. 
These  behaviors  included  descending  a  ladder  facing 
outward;  carrying  an  object  while  using  a  ladder;  jumping 
from  a  machine;  not  cleaning  mud,  oil,  etc.  from  work 
boots;  or  not  using  an  access  system  when  one  is  available. 

Using  the  random  sampling  procedure  described  in  the 
"Methods"  section,  100  observations  were  made  of  main- 
tenance workers'  behavior  while  they  were  maintaining 
mining  equipment.  During  these  observations,  six  in- 
stances of  direct,  high-risk  behaviors,  such  as  jumping  off 
the  machine,  were  observed.  Thus,  the  estimate  of  the 
proportion  of  high-risk  behaviors,  as  calculated  from 
equation  1,  is  0.06,  plus  or  minus  0.05.  A  summary  of  all 
behavioral  data  from  both  the  accident  records  and  field 
observations  is  presented  in  table  3. 

Table  3  indicates  that  an  additional  237  accidents  (17.2 
pet)  had  a  possible  behavioral  component,  although  the 


behavior  was  not  necessarily  that  of  the  injured  individual. 
These  events  were  unmarked  hazards,  such  as  removed 
floor  plates,  debris  on  surface,  and  spills  on  surface.

Machine  Access  System  Design 


Table  4.-Slip-and-fall  accident  location,  proportion  of 
total  work  time  in  location,  and  relative  risk 


The  accident  narratives  indicate  that  access  system 
elements  (ladders,  steps  and  stairs,  and  walkways)  were  the 
location  of  291  accidents  (21.1  pet  of  total).  Field  data 
indicate  that  workers  spend  10.8  pet  of  their  total  work 
time  on  ladders,  steps  and  stairs,  and  walkways.  A 
convenient  way  of  evaluating  the  relative  risk  of  access 
system  elements  is  to  divide  the  percentage  total  of  all 
accidents  that  occur  on  an  access  system  element  by  the 
percentage  of  total  work  time  during  which  the  worker  is 
located  on  that  element.  The  higher  the  obtained  ratio, 
the  more  hazardous  the  access  system  element.  Such  an 
analysis  is  presented  in  table  4.  This  table  incorporates  the 
accident  narrative  data  with  the  data  obtained  in  the  field 
regarding  the  location  of  the  worker.  Ladders,  with  a  ratio 
of  6.1,  and  steps  and  stairs,  with  a  ratio  of  2.4,  are  the 
most  hazardous  of  the  access  system  elements.  The  cate- 
gories of  surfaces  and  machines  have  been  added  to  this 
table  for  completeness. 

Measurements  were  taken  on  the  access  systems  of 
eight  new  machines  at  the  1988  MINEXPO  in  Chicago, 
IL.  Three  of  these  machines  were  front-end  loaders  and 
two  were  off-road  haul  trucks.  Similar  measurements  of 
older  machines  were  taken  at  a  cooperating  mining 
operation  on  two  front-end  loaders  and  two  off-road  haul 
trucks.  These  data  are  presented  in  table  5.  There  is  a 
noticeable  improvement  in  the  design  of  the  newer 
equipment  access  systems.  The  overall  average  rating  for 
new  machine  access  systems  was  1.7  as  compared  with  2.0 
for  older  machines.  Older  truck  ladders  deviate  the  most 
from  the  SAE  J 185  guidelines  with  an  average  of  2.6. 


Workstation  Design 

Maintenance  workers  often  gain  access  to  the  workplace 
through  the  use  of  workstands  or  other  means  of  access 
that  are  not  an  integral  part  of  the  mining  equipment. 
A  common  example  is  a  stepladder.  A  number  of  such 
accidents  where  the  workstand  design  appeared  to  be  at 
fault  were  noted  in  the  accident  narratives.  These 
incidents  were  grouped  with  other  records  where  there 
were  apparent  design  problems  with  the  workstation. 
Three  hundred  instances  of  workstation  design  problems 
were  noted  in  the  accident  narratives.  These  data  are 
presented  in  table  6.

DISCUSSION 


This  study  sought  to  identify  antecedent  events  to  slip 
and  fall  accidents  in  order  to  develop  a  better  under- 
standing of  the  causation  of  such  accidents.  In  addition,  it 
sought  to  describe  the  relative  roles  of  worker  behavior 
and  machine  design  contributory  to  accidents.  It  was 
further  hypothesized  that  the  perception  of  risk  would 


affect  behavior.  Data  were  collected  from  two  different 
sources:  reports  of  surface  mining  maintenance  accidents 
and  a  field  study  of  maintenance  workers. 

There  were  three  major  findings  in  this  study.  First, 
analysis  of  the  accident  narratives  showed  that  286  acci- 
dents, or  20.7  pet  of  the  total  number  of  accidents  studied, 


occurred  on  access  system  elements  such  as  ladders,  stairs 
and  steps,  and  walkways.  In  contrast,  workers  spent  only 
10.8  pet  of  their  total  work  time  on  access  system  ele- 
ments. Second,  a  group  of  direct  worker  behaviors  ante- 
cedent to  slip-and-fall  accidents  was  identified  in  the 
accident  narratives.  These  direct  behaviors  were  found  in 
123  accident  narratives,  or  8.9  pet  of  the  total  number  of 
accident  reports.  Field  studies  indicated  that  these 
behaviors  constituted  approximately  6  pet  of  all  worker 
behaviors,  plus  or  minus  5  pet.  Third,  older  machines 
were  ranked  lower  than  new  machines  when  measured 
against  the  SAE  J 185  standards,  with  overall  rankings  of 
2.0  and  1.7,  respectively.  Ladders  and  handrails  on  older 
off-road  haul  trucks  were  particularly  problematic. 

Finally,  during  the  80  h  of  observation,  a  single  slipping 
accident  was  observed.  This  slip  did  not  result  in  an  injury 
and  occurred  on  a  fixed  ladder.  No  direct  behavior  ante- 
cedents were  observed  prior  to  this  incident. 

RELATIVE  HAZARD  OF  DIRECT  WORKER 

BEHAVIOR  AND  MACHINE  ACCESS 

SYSTEM  DESIGN 

In  order  to  discuss  the  relative  roles  of  direct  worker 
behavior  and  machine  design  in  the  causation  of  main- 
tenance slip-and-fall  accidents,  a  mutual  basis  of  com- 
parison between  these  two  classes  of  antecedent  events 
must  be  established.  The  method  used  in  this  report  is  to 
calculate  relative  risk  ratios.  Relative  risk  ratios  compare 
the  rates  of  occurrence  of  an  accident  in  one  location  or 
category  with  the  rate  of  occurrence  of  similar  accidents 
elsewhere.  A  relative  risk  ratio  greater  than  1  indicates  a 
higher  degree  of  risk  associated  with  that  given  category. 
The  general  formula  for  relative  risk  ratios  is  given  in 
equation  2  (19). 


RR  = 


(AcC/hC) 


(TAc  -  AcC)/Th  -  hC) 


(2) 


where       RR  =  relative  risk, 

AcC  =  accidents  associated  with  category, 

hC  =  hours  worked  in  category, 

TAc  =  total  number  of  accidents, 

and  Th  =  total  hours  worked. 

(The  term  "category,"  as  used  in  this  equation,  refers  to 
location  or  the  type  of  behavior  associated  with  the  acci- 
dent and  hours  worked  terms.)  Conceptually,  there  is  no 
difference  between  the  proportion  of  hours  worked  and 
the  number  of  hours  worked.  The  field  estimates  of  the 
proportion  of  work  time  spent  in  various  locations  or 
behaviors  was  substituted  for  the  number  of  work  hours; 
the  total  work  hours  is  then  equal  to  unity. 


The  first  comparison  made  was  between  direct  behavior 
and  use  of  access  system  elements.  Direct  behavior  has  a 
relative  risk  ratio  of  1.5,  while  access  systems  have  a  rela- 
tive risk  ratio  of  2.2.  These  ratios  are  presented  in  ta- 
ble 7;  the  calculation  of  all  relative  risk  ratios  is  included 
in  appendix  A.  Access  systems  are  relatively  more  hazard- 
ous than  direct  behavior.  This  effect  is  maintained  when 
the  overlap  cases  are  eliminated  from  the  calculation  of 
the  relative  risk  ratios.  Based  on  the  accident  narratives, 
there  is  an  overlap  of  18  cases  between  the  2  sets  of  ante- 
cedent events:  direct  behavior  and  access  system  elements. 
If  these  cases  are  eliminated,  the  relative  risk  ratios  for  be- 
havior and  access  systems  are  1.3  and  2.0,  respectively.

The  preliminary  ratios  in  table  4  suggest  that  some  ac- 
cess elements,  particularly  ladders,  are  more  hazardous 
than  others.  Accordingly,  relative  risk  ratios  were  cal- 
culated for  individual  access  system  elements.  These  ratios 
are  also  presented  in  table  7.  Ladders  have  a  very  high 
relative  risk  ratio  of  6.8,  stairs  and  steps  have  a  high  ratio 
of  2.5,  and  walkways  have  a  very  low  ratio  of  0.2.  The 
relative  risk  ratios  confirm  the  preliminary  estimates  of 
the  relative  hazards  of  access  system  elements  made  in 
table  4. 

The  greatest  hazard  antecedent  to  slip-and-fall  accidents 
is  apparently  the  access  systems,  particularly  ladders. 
Reference  to  table  5  shows  that,  although  improvement 
has  been  noted,  ladders  are  tied  for  the  worst  overall 
ranking  in  terms  of  compliance  with  SAE  J185  off-road 
access  system  standards.  Commonly  noted  ladder  defici- 
encies were  the  height  of  the  first  step  above  the  ground 
and  unequal  spacing  of  ladder  rungs. 

RISK  PERCEPTION 

The  concept  of  subjective  risk  was  introduced  earlier  in 
this  report.  Subjective  risk  is  defined  as  the  individual's 
experience  of  the  hazard  level  associated  with  some  behav- 
ior. The  field  data  gathered  on  worker  behavior  give  some 
understanding  of  the  subjective  experience  of  risk  asso- 
ciated with  behavior.  During  the  maintenance  of  the  min- 
ing equipment,  six  high-risk  behaviors  were  observed  dur- 
ing a  105-min  observation  period.  The  individuals  were 
engaging  in  identified  risk  behaviors  at  a  rate  of  one 
behavior  every  17.5  min.  None  of  these  behaviors  resulted 
in  an  accident. 


10 


During  the  collection  of  field  data,  one  slipping  incident 
was  observed  in  approximately  80  h.  This  incident  did  not 
result  in  an  injury. 

Earlier,  the  incidence  rate  of  slip-and-fall  accidents  was 
estimated  as  0.58  per  100  work  years  for  all  surface  mine 
workers.  Using  the  same  method,  the  incidence  rate  of 
slip-and-fall  accidents  for  maintenance  workers  is  esti- 
mated as  1.98  per  100  work  years. 

An  individual  worker's  subjective  risk  experience  with 
regard  to  hazardous  behaviors  would  be  this:  A  minor, 
non-injurious  slip  might  be  expected,  on  average,  after 
enough  time  had  elapsed  for  the  occurrence  of  274  haz- 
ardous, or  risk  associated  behaviors.  An  accident  has  a 
probability  of  occurrence  of  0.019  per  work  year.  Thus, 
using  a  binomial  estimate,  there  is  about  an  even  chance 


(p  =  0.46)  that  a  worker  could  work  40  years  without  ex- 
periencing a  slip-and-fall  accident.  (The  calculations  for 
this  probability  are  shown  in  appendix  B.)  It  should  now 
be  apparent  that  the  subjective  level  of  risk  of  engaging  in 
risk  behavior  is,  justifiably,  quite  low. 

Similar  arguments  can  be  made  for  estimation  of  the 
subjective  appreciation  of  the  risk  of  using  access  systems. 
The  estimated  incidence  rate  of  slip-and-fall  accidents 
while  using  access  systems  is  0.46  per  100  work  years. 
(Calculations  are  shown  in  appendix  B.)  If  this  rate  is 
converted  to  an  annual  binomial  probability  of  injury  while 
using  an  access  system  of  0.004,  the  probability  of  working 
for  40  years  without  experiencing  a  slip-and-fall  injury 
while  using  an  access  system  is  0.84. 


SUMMARY  AND  CONCLUSIONS 


The  Bureau  studied  slip-and-fall  accidents  that  occurred 
during  surface  mining  maintenance.  A  list  of  antecedent 
events  to  slip-and-fall  accidents  was  generated  from  analy- 
sis of  slip-and-fall  accident  narratives. 

Two  main  variables  were  studied  as  they  related  to  slip- 
and-fall  accidents  during  surface  mining  maintenance. 
These  variables  are  the  direct  behavior  of  the  individuals 
involved  in  the  accident  and  the  design  of  the  access 
systems.  The  use  of  access  systems  was  found  to  have  a 
higher  relative  risk  ratio  than  the  direct,  hazardous 
behaviors  identified  from  the  analysis  of  the  narratives. 
Ladders  were  identified  as  the  most  hazardous  of  access 
systems.  Improvement  in  the  compliance  of  new  equip- 
ment access  systems  with  SAE  J 185  guidelines  was  noted, 
but  the  access  systems  of  older  equipment,  particularly 
off-road  haul  truck  ladders,  are  still  problematic. 
Subjective  risk  values  were  estimated  for  maintenance 
workers;  the  obtained  values  were  quite  low,  suggesting 
that  individuals  will  routinely  engage  in  risk  behavior 
without  significant  expectation  of  injury. 


While  the  probability  of  a  slip-and-fall  injury  is  small 
for  any  individual  maintenance  worker,  it  is  cumulative  for 
a  group.  The  probability  of  a  maintenance  worker  sustain- 
ing a  slip-and-fall  injury  in  a  company  with  five  mainten- 
ance workers  is  0.095  during  any  year.  Thus,  it  is  probably 
more  reasonable  for  a  company  to  be  more  sensitive  to 
accident  risk  than  an  individual  because  the  expectation  of 
loss  is  greater. 

Given  that  a  company  is  more  likely  to  be  sensitive  to 
the  risk  of  slip-and-fall  accidents,  what  strategies  should  be 
taken  to  improve  slip-and-fall  safety?  The  first  priority, 
based  on  the  findings  of  this  study,  would  be  to  improve 
the  quality  of  access  system  elements,  particularly  ladders. 
A  reasonable  approach  might  be  to  bring  them  into  com- 
pliance with  the  SAE  J185  guidelines.  The  second  priority 
would  be  to  make  an  effort  to  change  the  subjective  risk 
perception  of  the  maintenance  workers.  Training  pro- 
grams have  been  described  (20)  that  effectively  teach 
workers  to  recognize  hazards  and  to  change  their  behavior 
accordingly.
