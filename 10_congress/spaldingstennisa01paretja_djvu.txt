^Xj         REVIEW  OF  THE  SEASON         ^^ 
iV  OF  1899  V\ 


The  lawn  tennis  season  of  1899  was  highly  successful  from 
every  point  of  view.  The  absence  of  Wrenn  and  Larned  the  year 
before,  when  they  were  with  Roosevelt's  Rough  Riders  in  Cuba, 
gave  the  younger  element  a  chance  to  get  away  from  the  dis- 
couraging shadow  of  superior  skill,  and  they  improved  rapidly. 
Just  how  much  this  improvement  has  progressed  is  a  matter  of 
opinion,  for  it  is  difficult  to  find  a  fixed  standard  from  which  to 
judge  of  it.  Wrenn  was  too  weak  from  his  long  siege  of  the 
fever  to  play  again  during  the  season  of  1899,  but  Larned  'did 
play,  and  it  is  on  his  form  that  all  comparisons  must  be  based. 
However,  Larned  did  not  show  anything  like  his  old  form,  ex- 
cept at  rare  intervals  last  year,  and  I  am  inclined  to  believe  that 
he  did  not  once  reach  the  mark  he  set  for  himself  two  seasons 
before.  His  play  cannot  therefore  be  justly  used  as  a  standard 
from  which  to  judge  the  progress  of  the  others. 

Champion  Whitman's  unparalleled  success,  and  the  unexpected 
outcome  of  the  Newport  championship  meeting  were  the  features 
of  the  season.  Early  in  the  spring,  Whitman  first  demonstrated 
his  willingness  and  his  ability  to  win  all  the  challenge  cups  in 
sight,  and  he  finished  the  season  with  a  long  list  to  his  credit. 
He  went  through  a  big  field  for  the  Massachusetts  State  cham- 
pionship, and  won  the  title  from  Ware  after  a  five-set  match. 
Then  came  his  successful  defense  of  the  Middle  States  champion- 
ship against  Larned,  and  the  Canadian  championship  victory  fol- 
lowed the  next  week  without  the  loss  of  a  set.  Two  weeks  of 
comparative  rest  gave  him  ample  time  to  recuperate,  and  then  he 
successfully  defended  the  New  York  State  championship  and  the 
Longwood  challenge  cups.  Next  he  went  to  Southampton  and 
played  through  the  Long  Island  tournament,  winning  without  the 
loss  of  a  set ;  then  came  two  more  weeks  of  rest  before  his  suc- 
cessful defense  of  the  National  championship,  which  ended  his 
season  at  Newport. 


b  SPALDING  S   ATHLETIC    LIBRARY. 

Throughout  the  history  of  American  lawn  tennis,  no  player,  be 
he  the  champion  or  not  the  champion,  has  ever  played  through  a 
season  so  successfully  as  that.  Whitman's  entering  one  tourna- 
ment after  another  exhibited  a  courage  and  confidence  that  no 
previous  champion  has  ever  shown,  not  even  excepting  the  fa- 
mous R.  D.  Sears,  of  cherished  memory.  Sears  played  through 
several  seasons  unbeaten,  but  never  such  a  season  as  that  which 
Whitman  recently  finished.  Unquestionably  Whitman  is  the 
greatest  match  winner  we  have  ever  had  in  America,  not  even 
excepting  the  redoubtable  "Bob"  Wrenn. 

Of  all  the  most  promising  of  the  young  players  who  showed 
good  form  this  season,  we  find  Beals  Wright,  the  interscholastic 
champion,  the  most  consistent  winner  of  them  all,  and  this  be- 
cause he  understands  safe  play  best  and  the  use  of  the  "forcing 
stroke."  Wright,  I  venture  to  predict,  will  be  one  of  the  best 
winriers  of  the  country  before  he  leaves  Harvard.  He  plays  in 
exactly  "Bob"  Wrenn 's  style,  only  much  better  than  Wrenn  did 
before  he  entered  college.  His  chief  failing  now  is  his  lack  of 
speed,  but  this  will  come  in  due  time. 

Holcombe  Ward  and  John  A.  Allen,  too,  have  carried  safe  play 
to  a  considerable  degree  of  success,  though  neither  is  as  sound  in 
theory  or  practice  as  Wright.  Allen  volleys  weakly  and  comes 
to  the  net  too  seldom,  often  trying  to  win  with  a  fast  ground 
stroke  instead  of  working  up  to  the  proper  position  to  kill  with  a 
smash.  Ward,  on  the  other  hand,  uses  the  net  too  much,  often 
taking  big  risks  to  get  there.  His  cut  stroke  lacks  speed  for  sure 
passing  at  the  net,  though  it  is  none  the  worse  for  the  twist  in 
forcing  plays. 

Two  other  young  players  showed  brilliant  form  during  last 
season,  and  much  is  expected  of  them  this  year.  Raymond  D. 
Little,  the  Princeton  expert  who  won  the  International  Champion- 
ship in  Canada  from  Fischer  and  Bond  late  in  the  season,  shows 
all  the  marks  of  the  highest  type  of  brilliant  play,  though  his 
style  is  not  an  easy  or  a  graceful  one.  He  takes  too  many  risky 
chances,  often  trying  to  win  from  unsafe  positions,  rather  than 
waiting  for  the  true  opening  for  the  winning  play.  Young  Ed- 
ward P.   Larncd  is  an  exact  reproduction  of  his  famous  older 


SPALDING  S   ATHLETIC   LIBRARY.  7 

brother  in  style  and  skill.  A  few  years  of  experience  promise  to 
round  him  out  into  a  second  star  of  his  brother's  magnitude,  but 
he  shows  no  tendency  toward  steadiness,  safe  play  having  been 
already  sacrificed  for  brilliancy. 

Again  last  year  the  championship  meeting  ended  in  the  triumph 
of  steady,  aggressive  play  backed  up  by  the  best  of  physical  con- 
dition, over  the  intermittent  brilliancy  that  is  so  characteristic 
of  American  top  form,  and  the  old  lesson  of  1894  was  repeated 
once  more.  There  is  a  remarkable  similarity  between  Goodbody's 
success  at  Newport  six  years  ago  and  that  of  Paret  last  season. 
Each  struggled  through  a  difficult  field,  with  the  chances  of  draw 
against  him,  and  each  seemed  beaten  again  and  again,  only  to 
rise  to  the  surface  once  more  through  dogged  persistence  and 
constant  ability  to  keep  the  balls  "coming  back"  to  his  opponent. 
Each  triumphed  over  one  brilliant  opponent  after  another,  only 
to  spend  his  last  strength  in  a  heart-breaking  final  match  of  the 
full  five  sets,  and  then  go  down  before  aggressive  steadiness  in 
the  challenge  match  for  the  championship.  Is  not  the  moral 
plain?  Look  back  at  the  championship  records  for  the  last  six 
or  seven  years — ever  since  the  modern  game  came  into  vogue — 
and  what  do  you  see?  Steadiness,  steadiness,  steadiness  on  top, 
first,  last  and  all  the  time ! 

The  season  of  1899  furnished  perhaps  the  most  useful  data  that 
has  yet  been  collected  in  regard  to  the  relative  skill  of  the  leaders 
in  different  sections  of  the  country.  The  players  of  the  middle 
West  have  been  known  for  the  last  five  or  six  years,  and  their 
relative  skill  has  been  demonstrated  often  enough  within  the  last 
few  to  permit  several  of  the  Chicago  leaders  each  year  to  be 
ranked  high  up  on  the  country's  honor  list.  The  extreme  West 
has  long  had  good  players,  although  their  exact  relative  skill  has 
been  shrouded  in  doubt. 

A  team  of  four  of  the  leading  Eastern  players,  however,  com- 
posed of  Whitman,  Davis,  Ward  and  Wright,  made  a  tour  of  the 
Coast  tennis  resorts  in  September,  and  met  a  similar  team  of  the 
four  leading  Californian  experts  at  Monterey  the  first  week  they 
played  there.  These  matches  were  played  on  the  "round  robin" 
system,  and  each  was  three  out  of  five  sets,  the  visitors  playing 


SPALDING  S   ATHLETIC    LIBRARY. 


m 


SPALDING  S   ATHLETIC   LIBRARY.  9 

each  of  the  home  team  in  turn.  The  Easterners  played  under 
some  disadvantage,  being  in  a  strange  cHmate  from  that  they  were 
used  to,  and  playing  on  courts  with  a  surface  radically  different 
from  anything  else  they  had  ever  used.  Even  under  these  con- 
ditions they  lost  only  two  matches  in  sixteen. 

In  doubles,  the  feature  of  the  season  was  the  play  of  two  teams, 
Davis  and  Ward,  who  won  the  championship,  and  Hackett  and 
Allen,  who  won  every  tournament  they  entered  except  the  three 
in  which  they  met  the  champions.  The  play  of  the  Yale  team 
was  certainly  very  clever,  although  hardly  in  the  same  class  on 
grass  courts  with  the  champions.  Theirs  is  more  of  a  defensive 
than  an  aggressive  game,  while  the  champions'  style  is  just  the 
reverse.  The  surprise  of  the  year  in  doubles  occurred  in  the  far 
West,  when  Davis  and  Ward  were  badly  beaten,  three  straight 
sets,  by  Whitman  and  Wright — who,  by  the  way,  should  prove 
a  most  dangerous  combination  next  season — and  the  latter  in  turn 
were  beaten  in  straight  sets  by  the  Hardy  brothers,  of  California. 


OFFICIAL  RANKING  OF  THE  PLAYERS. 

The  report  of  the  official  Ranking  Committee  for  the  season  of 
1899,  was  as  follows : 

Class  I — (owe  i-6  15)  M.  D-  Whitman. 

Class  2 — (scratch)  D.  F.  Davis,  W.  A.  Earned. 

Class  3— (2-6  15)  J.  P.  Paret,  K.  Collins,  G.  L.  Wrenn,  Jr.,  L. 
E.  Ware,  B.  C.  Wright,  H.  Ward,  R.  P.  Huntington,  Jr.,  R. 
Stevens,  E.  P.  Fischer,  J.  A.  Allen. 

Class  4— (4-6  15)  S.  C.  Millett,  W.  S.  Bond,  R.  D.  Little,  H.  H. 
Hackett,  E.  R.  Marvin,  C.  R.  Budlong. 

Class  5— (15)  J.  C.  Davidson,  A.  Codman,  R.  McKiltrick,  E.  P.

The  committee  has  been  unable  to  rank  the  following  players : 
C.  Hobart,  A.  E.  Foote,  M.  G.  Chace,  G.  H.  Miles,  C.  B.  Neel, 
C.  P.  Dodge.     Hobart  has  not  played  in  this  country  at  all  this

season.      Neel    has   played    in   the   Western   championship   only, 
which  he  won. 

Of  the  players  on  the  Pacific  Coast,  Sumner  Hardy  is  undoubt- 
edly entitled  to  rank  among  our  first  five  players.  George  Whit- 
ney, Samuel  Hardy,  R.  F.  Whitney  and  J.  F.  Foulkes  must  also 
be  counted  among  our  good  players.

Ranking  Committee. 

In  comparing  the  list  of  1899  with  that  of  1898,  many  interesting 
comparisons  can  be  made.  The  committee  has  ranked  only 
thirty-one  players  this  year,  as  against  thirty-seven  last  season, 
and  many  names  which  appeared  last  year  are  not  included  in 
the  present  list.  Of  the  1898  list,  the  following  names  do  not  ap- 
pear on  the  list  for  1899 :  G.  K.  Belden,  J.  D.  Forbes,  G.  H.  Miles, 
R.  H.  Carleton,  A.  P.  Hawes,  R.  Hooker,  G.  W.  Lee,  A.  L.  Willis- 
ton,  H.  T.  Cole,  W.  Cross,  H.  L.  Ewer,  C.  Whitbeck,  W.  K.  Au- 
chincloss,  H.  A.  Plummer  and  Harris.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
following  names  are  found  in  the  1899  list,  which  did  not  appear 
in  1898:  W.  A.  Earned,  K.  Collins,  R.  P.  Huntington,  Jr.,  E.  P. 
Earned,  N.  H.  Mundy,  K.  Horton,  J.  R.  Carpenter,  Jr.,  W.  C. 
Grant  and  A.  C.  McMaster.

THE  NEWPORT  MEETING. 

The  national  championship  tournament  of  1899  offered  one  in- 
novation which  must  be  looked  upon  as  desirable  above  all  others, 
in  the  absence  of  the  crowding  on  the  entry-list  of  a  host  of  third 
and  fourth-class  players,  who  were  bound  to  be  hopelessly  out- 
classed in  such  a  tournament.  As  it  was,  the  list  included  every 
active  player  of  importance,  except  Davidson,  Millett,  Miles, 
Hackett  and  a  few  prominent  Westerners.  It  was  unfortunate 
perhaps  that  Larned  and  Allen  were  forced  to  default  on  account 
of  physical  unfitness,  and  Wrenn's  absence  was  also  because  he 
was  in  no  condition  to  play,  but  Neel,  Foote  and  one  or  two  others 
who  played  in  the  spring,  had  no  thought  of  entering  at  Newport. 
To  make  up  for  these  absentees,  there  were  the  entries  of  both 
Huntington  and  Chace,  the  two  veteran  experts  of  years  gone  by, 
as  well  as  Collins  and  Bond  from  the  West,  this  being  the  first 
Eastern  appearance  of  the  former.  All  in  all,  the  entries  last  sea- 
son were  stronger,  if  not  more  numerous,  than  those  of  the  year 
before,  and  the  tournament  was  in  every  way  a  success. 

The  preliminary  round  brought  out  nothing  of  particular  in- 
terest, but  in  the  first  the  Ward-Budlong,  Paret-Chace,  Hunting- 
ton-Little  and  Wrenn-Fischer  matches  began  the  excitement.  In 
the  first  was  shown  a  most  striking  contrast  between  modern 
methods  and  those  of  ten  years  ago,  while  Paret  beat  Chace  be- 
cause of  better  physical  condition  to  stand  the  strain. 

In  the  second  round  only  the  Huntington-Stevens  and  Bond- 
Wright  matches  were  of  special  importance.  Here  the  veteran 
first  showed  his  splendid  staying  qualities,  and  won  in  five  sets 
from  the  one  man  above  all  others  who  is  supposed  to  outlast  any 
other  player  on  the  courts.  Bond  beat  Wright  in  a  curious  match 
of  five  sets,  in  which  each  took  turns  at  weak  play.  Wright  lost 
his  nerve  somewhat  in  the  third  set,  and  slowed  up  noticeably  in 
his  speed,  which  gave  the  Westerner  just  the  chance  he  wanted, 
and  he  took  quick  advantage  of  his  opportunity.

The  fourth  round  furnished  four  exciting  matches,  three  of 
them  being  of  the  "heart-breaking"  order.  Ware  won  from 
Ward  after  five  sets  of  the  most  trying  kind  of  play,  and  this,  too, 
after  the  score  had  reached  two  sets  to  one  against  him.  ColHns, 
the  Westerner,  showed  his  first  real  touch  of  championship  form 
against  Wrenn,  winning  by  three  sets  to  two  in  really  clever  style. 
His  play  showed  so  much  thoughtful  headwork  that  he  was  at 
once  picked  out  as  a  student  of  the  game  who  must  ultimately 
rise  to  the  top,  or  very  near  it. 

Davis  beat  Bond  in  four  sets,  which  were  a  constant  struggle 
for  the  net,  with  the  advantage  in  favor  of  Davis  because  he  used 
better  ground-strokes  than  Bond. 

The  fourth  match  was  one  of  the  longest  of  the  tournament, 
being  between  Paret  and  Huntington,  and  furnished  another 
struggle  with  endurance  as  a  potent  factor.  The  semi-final  round 
brought  Paret  against  Ware,  and  Davis  against  Collins ;  and 
Paret  and  Davis  each  won  in  straight  sets. 

The  final  match  between  Paret  and  Davis  proved  the  biggest 
"upset"  of  the  tournament.  Paret,  hitherto  a  second-class  player, 
was  thought  to  be  nearly  if  not  quite  outclassed,  and  Davis  suf- 
fered somewhat  from  over-confidence.  Both  men  rushed  to  the 
net  at  every  opening,  coming  in  constantly  behind  the  service,  and 
sharp  volleying  at  the  net  or  an  opponent's  error  accounted  for 
nearly  every  point.  Both  used  the  most  modern  tactics, .  and 
each  made  such  good  use  of  his  service  that  the  server  won  a  large 
majority  of  the  games.  In  the  end  this  match  furnished  another 
victory  for  steadiness  and  physical  training,  backed  by  the  ever- 
lasting persistence  that  has  scored  so  many  victories  for  ex- 
champion  Wrenn. 

The  challenge  match  for  the  championship  found  a  tired  man 
pitted  against  a  fresh  one,  with  the  same  result  recorded  in  nearly 
every  previous  year  where  the  challenger  has  not  outclassed  the 
holder  of  the  title.  Paret  was  totally  unable  to  do  himself  jus- 
tice, although  Whitman  would  probably  have  won  anyway.  Poor 
judgment  and  physical  "staleness"  kept  the  challenger  from  con- 
tinuing in  the  first  two  sets  the  net  play  that  had  won  each  of  his 
victories  for  him,  and  from  the  base-line  he  was  no  match  for

the  champion.  When  the  third  set  began,  however,  Paret  changed 
his  style  of  play,  and  instantly  the  whole  complexion  of  the  match 
was  altered.  Rushing  net  tactics  bothered  the  champion  badly, 
and  his  antagonist  ran  the  first  five  games  off  the  reel  in  rapid 
fashion,  winning  a  substantial  lead,  that  ultimately  gave  him  the 
third  set.  In  the  fourth,  however,  the  champion  won  by  7-5, 
after  a  close  struggle  up  to  5-all. 

The  championship  doubles  were  rather  one-sided.  Davis  and 
Ward  are  easily  the  strongest  pair  in  the  country,  and  their  loss 
of  the  first  set  to  Allen  and  Hackett  in  the  East  vs.  West  match 
was  due  more  to  over-confidence  and  carelessness  than  inferior 
skill.  After  that  the  result  was  never  in  doubt,  while  in  the  chal- 
lenge match,  the  lack  of  practice  of  the  holders  left  them  little 
chance  for  a  victory,  and  they  were  unable  to  win  a  set.

THE  WOMEN'S  CHAMPIONSHIPS. 

The  annual  championship  for  the  women's  championships  of 
the  United  States,  was  held  as  usual  as  Wissahickon,  near  Phila- 
delphia, beginning  June  2i.  The  feature  of  the  meeting  was  the 
presence  of  Miss  Marion  Jones,  a  daughter  of  the  U.  S.  Senator 
from  California;  Miss  Myrtle  McAteer,  of  Pittsburg;  Miss  Carrie 
Neely,  of  Chicago,  and  a  number  of  other  strong  visiting  players. 
Miss  Jones  carried  off  first  honors  in  the  singles  without  the  loss 
of  a  single  set,  and  as  Miss  Juliette  Atkinson,  of  Brooklyn,  the 
former  champion,  did  not  appear  to  defend  her  title,  the  Western 
champion  took  it  by  default.  In  the  doubles,  Miss  McAteer  and 
Miss  Jennie  Craven,  of  Chicago,  carried  off  the  championship, 
beating  a  team  of  Philadelphians,  Miss  Edith  Rastall  and  Miss  A. 
L.  Hoskins,  in  the  finals.

THE  LONGWOOD  TOURNAMENT. 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  East  in 
doubles,  and  the  Longwood  challenge  cup  in  singles,  was  held  at 
the  Longwood  Cricket  Club,  Boston,  beginning  July  24.  There 
were  forty-eight  entries  in  the  singles  and  nineteen  teams  in  the 
doubles,  including  all  of  the  strongest  players  in  the  Eastern  sec- 
tion of  the  country.  R.  P.  Huntington,  the  Yale  veteran,  made 
his  second  appearance  of  the  season  at  this  meeting,  but  could  not 
make  any  headway  against  the  terrific  speed  of  Davis  in  the  pre- 
liminary round. 

The  first  surprise  of  the  tournament  came  in  the  defeat  of  L. 
E.  Ware  in  the  second  round  by  J.  P.  Paret,  the  score  being  three 
sets  to  one  in  favor  of  the  New  Yorker.  Paret,  however,  was 
unable  to  get  a  set  from  Davis  in  the  third  round,  while  it  took 
George  Wrenn  five  sets  to  beat  Holcombe  Ward.  In  the  semi- 
finals Davis  beat  Wrenn  in  a  clever  four-set  match,  while  Larned 
found  a  stumbling-block  in  Beals  Wright,  just  as  he  had  in  Ralph 
McKittrick  two  rounds  before.  Although  the  sets  were  all  close 
in  each  of  these  matches,  the  brilliant  New  Yorker  came  out  on 
top  each  time. 

The  final  match  in  the  singles  was  very  sensational.  Larned 
took  the  first  two  sets  from  Davis  in  commanding  style,  and  with 
a  lead  on  the  third  lost  all  his  accuracy.  Davis  improved  with 
every  game,  and  won  that  and  the  next  two  sets  in  quick  order, 
taking  the  match.  In  the  championship  round  for  the  Longwood 
challenge  cup,  however,  he  played  without  much  confidence 
against  Champion  Whitman,  and  was  beaten  in  straight  sets. 

The  Eastern  championship  doubles  brought  out  a  strong  field, 
including  many  of  the  veteran  experts.  Two  ex-champion  teams, 
O.  S.  Campbell  and  R.  P.  Huntington  and  M.  G.  Chace  and  R. 
D.  Wrenn,  were  entered,  as  well  as  ex-champion  Hovey.  Chace 
and  Wrenn,  however,  were  unable  to  play,  and  Hovey  defaulted

after  playing  one  match.  The  chief  interest  centered  in  the  re- 
appearance of  Campbell  and  Huntington.  In  a  close  match  in  the 
second  round  against  Alfred  Codman  and  E.  R.  Marvin,  they  won 
after  five  sets  of  play,  but  in  the  semi-finals,  against  B.  C.  Wright 
and  C.  R.  Budlong,  Campbell  fell  and  wrenched  his  knee  so  badly 
in  the  fifth  set  that  it  was  impossible  for  him  to  finish  out  the 
match.  In  the  finals  Davis  and  Ward  scored  an  easy  victory  in

THE  MIDDLE  STATES  CHAMPIONSHIP. 
The  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  Middle 
States  was  held  at  the  Orange  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  beginning  July 
3.  The  entry-h'st  was  the  largest  that  has  ever  favored  this  meet- 
ing, and  the  quality  of  the  play  was  exceptionally  high.  The  first 
surprise  of  the  tournament  appeared  in  the  play  of  G.  H.  Miles, 
■  who  beat  Holcomb  Ward  in  the  easiest  kind  of  fashion,  and  then 
lost  almost  as  easily  to  J.-  P.  Paret,  in  the  third  round.  J.  A.  Allen 
also  beat  S.  C.  Millett,  while  W.  A.  Larned  beat  D.  F.  Davis,  after 
the  most  exciting  match  of  the  tournament.     In  the   semi-final 


^  SPALDlfjc's   ATHLETIC   LIBRARY. 

round,  Allen  was  outclassed  by  Larned,  while  Richard  Stevens 
and  J.  P.  Paret  played  a  stubbornly-contested  match  which  had  a 
sensational  ending.  Paret  won  the  first  set  and  in  the  second, 
came  within  one  stroke  of  winning  the  match  at  5-3.  Stevens, 
however,  was  very  steady  at  the  critical  point,  and  finally  won 
the  last  two  sets  by  deuce  scores.  This  match  lasted  so  long  and 
was  physically  so  severe  upon  the  players,  that  both  were  used 
up  in  consequence ;  Stevens  was  so  badly  exhausted  that  he  was 
forbidden  by  his  doctor  to  play  the  next  day,  and  Larned  won  in 
the  finals  by  default.  His  challenge  match  against  Champion 
Whitman  proved  a  big  disappointment,  however,  for  Whitman's 
safe  play  made  it  impossible  for  Larned  to  make  many  of  his 
brilliant  strokes  and  he  was  beaten  by  three  sets  to  one. 

In  the  doubles,  Ward  and  Davis  made  their  first  appearance  of 
the  season,  and  beat  the  crack  Yale  pair,  Hackett  and  Allen,  who 
had  previously  won  everything  in  sight,  by  three  sets  to  one.  The 
last  set  of  this  match  was  left  unfinished  at  the  end  of  the  tour- 
nament because  a  thunderstorm  interrupted  the  play,  and  the 
Yale  men  started  for  Chicago  the  next  day.  The  match  was 
finished  at  Longwood  a  few  weeks  later,  however,  and  won  then 
by  the  Harvard  team. 

The  full  scores  of  the  Middle  States  matches  were  as  follows :

THE  WESTERN  CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
The  annual  open  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  West 
in  both  singles  and  doubles,  was  held  on  the  grounds  of  the  Ken- 
wood Country  Club,  Chicago,  beginning  July  lo.  The  entry-list 
was  the  longest  that  has  ever  been  received  for  a  Western  tourna- 
ment, there  being  no  less  than  67  entries  in  the  singles  and  24 
teams  in  the  doubles.  This  number  included  H.  H.  Hackett  and 
J.  A.  Allen,  two  Yale  experts  from  the  East,  as  well  as  Carr  B. 
Neel,  his  brother  Sam  R.  Neel,  and  many  other  leading  players  in 
the  Middle  West.  Despite  his  lack  of  practice,  Carr  Neel,  the 
veteran  of  so  many  successful  campaigns,  won  first  honors  in  the 
tournament,  beating  Hackett  and  Allen  in  the  semi-final  and  final 
rounds.  Allen  made  the  best  showing  of  the  Easterners,  and  not 
only  beat  Sam  Neel  in  the  semi-final  round,  but  also  played  a  good 


28  Spalding's  athletic  library. 

match  against  the  older  brother  in  the  finals,  and  won  one  set  out 
of  the  four  played.  In  the  challenge  round  Neel  beat  Kreigh  Col- 
lins, the  previous  holder  of  the  Western  championship,  in  straight 
sets,  and  as  he  had  won  the  trophy  twice  before,  it  became  his 
personal  property. 

The  Western  championship  doubles,  the  winners  of  which  al- 
ways have  the  right  to  play  at  Newport  for  the  National  cham- 
pionship, furnished  some  exciting  play.  The  struggle  narrowed 
down  quickly  to  Hackett  and  Allen,  the  Eastern  pair,  and  Bond 
and  Collins,  the  strongest  of  the  Western  teams.  These  two  pairs 
met  in  the  semi-final  round,  and  the  Easterners  won  in  four  sets. 
They  had  an  easy  task  in  the  finkls,  beating  Waidner  and  Myers 
in  straight  sets,  and  thus  earned  the  right  to  play  at  Newport 
later  in  the  season.

who  had  not  shown  remarkable  form  at  Wissahickon  in  June.  In 
the  Chicago  tournament,  Miss  McAteer  won  first  honors,  after  she

by  Miss  Edythe  Parker,  of  Chicago.  In  the  challenge  round, 
however,  Miss  McAteer  was  beaten  by  Miss  Juliette  Atkinson,  of 
Brooklyn,  the  previous  holder  of  the  challenge  cup,  the  score  be- 
ing three  sets  to  one  in  favor  of  the  little  Brooklyn  champion.

THE  PACIFIC  COAST  CHAMPIONSHIP. 
George  F.  Whitney,  of  San  Francisco,  won  back  his  title  of 
champion  of  the  Pacific  Coast,  in  the  annual  tournament  at  San 


32  Spalding's  athletic  library. 

Rafael,  California,  beginning  July  3.  With  the  withdrawal  of 
Robert  Whitney,  the  championship  rested  between  George  Whit- 
ney and  the  two  Hardy  brothers,  all  of  the  other  players  being 
outclassed  by  these  experts.  Whitney  beat  Samuel  Hardy  in  the 
semi-final  round  by  three  straight  sets,  and  won  the  finals  by  de- 
fault from  Paul  Selby.  In  the  challenge  round,  Whitney  beat 
Sumner  Hardy,  the  previous  holder  of  the  title,  by  three  sets  to 
one.  Hardy  became  rather  exhausted  toward  the  end,  and  Whit- 
ney had  an  easy  task  after  the  first  two  sets.  Whitney's  success 
gave  him  a  second  "leg"  on  the  big  challenge  cup  representing  the 
Pacific  Coast  championship.  The  record  now  stands  as  follows : 
1894,  Samuel  Hardy;  1895,  Sumner  Hardy;  1896,  Samuel  Hardy; 
1897,  George  Whitney;  1898,  Sumner  Hardy;  1899,  George  Whit- 
ney. It  will  be  seen  from  this  that  Whitney  and  each  of  the 
Hardy  brothers  have  won  two  "legs"  on  the  trophy,  and  another 
victory  for  any  one  of  the  three  this  year  will  give  him  the  valu- 
able cup  as  his  personal  property. 

The  scores  of  last  year's  tournament  follow : 

Preliminary  Round.— Merle  Johnson  beat  B.  Henley,  Jr.,  6-3,  5-7,  6-3,  6-1;

THE  SOUTHERN  CHAMPIONSHIP. 
The  annual  tournament  for  the  Southern  championship  at  Wash- 
ington, beginning  May  i6,  was  as  usual  the  first  open  outdoor 
meeting  of  the  season.     As  in  both  of  the  two  previous  years,  this 


SPALDING  S   ATHLETIC   LIBRARY.  33 

event  furnished  a  duel  between  J.  C.  Davidson  and  J.  P.  Paret. 
The  latter  went  through  the  tournament  without  having  to  play 
a  close  set,  but  was  beaten  by  Davidson  in  the  challenge  round 
for  the  championship  by  6-i,  8-6,  8-6.  Paret  was  within  a  stroke 
of  each  of  the  last  two  sets,  but  Davidson's  hard  hitting  and  ac- 
curacy in  placing  made  it  impossible  each  time  for  him  to  win  the 
last  point  necessary.  The  record  for  this  cup  now  shows  two 
victories  for  Davidson  and  one  for  Paret. 

In  the  doubles,  Davidson  and  Paret  had  another  easy  victory, 
losing  only  one  set  during  the  tournament,  and  that  in  the  semi- 
finals to  Grant  and  Cragin.  This  was  the  fourth  successive  vic- 
tory for  Davidson  and  Paret,  who  have  lost  only  two  s6ts  in  these 
four  years.  '  I

THE  METROPOLITAN  CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  third  annual  tournament  for  the  Metropolitan  champion- 
ship was  held  at  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  in  New  York,  begin- 
ning June  26.  The  entry-list  was  even  stronger  than  at  the  Lenox 
tournament  the  week  before,  and  there  were  no  less  than  24 
entries  in  the  scratch  singles,  and  even  a  larger  number  in  the 
handicap  event.  Among  those  entered  was  S.  C.  Millett,  the 
former  holder  of  the  Metropolitan  championship,  and  his  defeat 
by  J.  P.  Paret  in  the  second  round  caused  considerable  surprise. 
In  the  finals  Paret  met  J.  A.  Allen,  the  champion  of  Yale,  who 
had  beaten  him  the  week  before  at  the  Lenox  Club,  and  turned 
the  tables,  by  winning  after  an  exciting  five-set  match,  in  which 
Allen  came  within  a  single  stroke  of  victory.  In  the  challenge 
match  against  Fischer,  the  former  holder  of  the  title,  Paret  had 
all  the  best  of  the  play  up  to  the  end  of  the  second  set,  when 
Fischer  took  command  and  won  out  in  good  style. 

The  doubles  proved  another  easy  victory  for  the  champion  Yale 
pair,  Hackett  and  Allen,  while  in  the  handicap  singles  O.  M. 
Bostwick,  one  of  the  strongest  players  of  the  club,  won  first  prize 
from  Dr.  H.  H.  Heywood  in  the  finals. 

The  full  scores  were  as  follows :

THE  NEW  ENGLAND  CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  time-honored  tournament  for  the  New  England  champion- 
ship was  revived  again  last  spring  by  the  New  Haven  Lawn 
Club,  and  the  meeting  was  greeted  with  much  success.  There 
were  no  less  than  thirty-two  entries  in  the  singles,  and  thirteen 
teams  in  the  doubles,  including,  beside  all  the  representative  Yale 
experts,  A.  E.  Foote,  the  veteran  ex-champion  of  New  England ; 
J.  C.  Davidson,  the  champion  of  the  South ;  R.  P.  Huntington, 
another  ex-champion  of  New  England,  and  J.  P.  Paret,  who  after- 
ward won  the  all-comers'  tournament  at  Newport.  The  features 
of  the  play  were  Davidson's  defeat  by  Hooker,  after  an  exciting 
match  of  three  sets,  Paret's  victory  over  Allen,  the  Yale  cham- 
pion, and  his  defeat  by  Dodge  in  the  next  round.  Huntington 
reached  the  semi-final  round,  and  then  lost  to  Dodge  in  a  close 
match,  while  Foote  beat  Hooker  in  the  semi-finals  and  Dodge  in 
the  finals,  winning  first  prize.  As  Driscoll,  of  San  Francisco,  the 
previous  holder  of  the  cup,  did  not  appear  to  defend  his  title, 
Foote  won  the  trophy  by  default,  and  became  its  permanent  own- 
er, as  he  had  won  it  twice  before.

THE  ATLANTIC  VS.  PACIFIC  MATCHES. 

A  team  of  four  representative  Eastern  experts  was  made  up 
at  Newport  during  the  championship  tournament  for  a  tour  to 
the  Pacific  Coast,  and  the  trip  was  made  in  September  at  the  in- 
vitation of  the  California  players.  The  Eastern  team  was  com- 
posed of  M.  D.  Whitman,  champion  of  the  United  States  and 
Canada;  D.  F.  Davis  and  Holcombe  Ward,  double  champions  of 
the  United  States,  and  B.  C.  Wright,  the  interscholastic  champion 
of  the  United  States.  This  team  left  New  York  on  Aug.  24,  and 
played  its  first  match  Sept.  5,  after  several  days'  practice,  on  the 
courts  of  the  Hotel  Del  Monte  at  San  Rafael,  California. 

The  chief  feature  of  the  Western  tour  was  a  special  match  be- 
tween the  Easterners  and  a  team  of  four  Pacific  Coast  experts, 
made  up  as  follows :     George  Whitney,  champion  of  the  Pacific 


38  Spalding's  athletic  library. 

Coast,  Sumner  Hardy  and  Samuel  Hardy,  champions  of  the  coast 
in  doubles  and  both  ex-champions  in  singles,  and  Robert  Whitney, 
the  present  coast  champion's  younger  brother.  These  four  play- 
ers were  unquestionably  the  strongest  in  the  far  West.  Each  of 
the  Eastern  men  met  all  of  the  Western  players  in  turn,  in  a 
match  of  the  best  three  in  five  sets,  and  the  result  proved  to  be 
an  overwhelming  victory  for  the  Eastern  team,  who  won  14  out  of 
the  16  matches  played.  Sumner  Hardy  was  the  only  one  of  the 
Western  men  who  scored,  but  he  not  only  beat  Ward  and  Wright 
but  played  a  close  five-set  match  against  Davis,  and  won  one  set 
from  Champion  Whitman. 

The  annual  open  tournament  for  the  Pacific  Coast  champion- 
ship in  doubles  was  also  held  the  same  week  at  Del  Monte  courts, 
and  to  the  surprise  of  every  one,  neither  of  the  Eastern  teams  won 
the  title.  Davis  and  Ward  were  unexpectedly  beaten  in  the  sec- 
ond round  by  Whitman  and  Wright,  and  the  latter  pair,  after 
beating  the  Whitney  brothers  in  the  finals,  went  down  in  straight 
sets  to  the  Hardy  brothers  in  the  challenge  round  for  the  coast 
championship. 

At  the  conclusion  of  the  Del  Monte  tournament,  the  Eastern 
players  made  a  trip  through  the  Northwest  section  of  the  United 
States  and  British  Columbia,  and  played  exhibition  matches  at 
Portland,  Seattle,  Tacoma  and  Victoria. 

The  summary  of  the  scores  of  the  exhibition  matches,  as  well 
as  the  championship  series,  follows :

THE  LONG  ISLAND  CHAMPIONSHIP. 

The  once  famous  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Long 
Island  was  revived  at  Southampton  last  season,  beginning  Aug.  2. 
It  was  held  as  an  invitation  meeting,  and  sixteen  players  accepted 
the  Meadow  Club's  hospitality,  including  Champion  Whitman, 
■  Larned,  Davis,  Ware,  Huntington  and  Ward.  The  first  surprise 
of  this  surprising  tournament  came  in  the  first  round,  when  J.  D. 
Pell,  the  young  player  who  had  recently  won  the  Columbia  Col- 
lege championship,  beat  Larned  by  three  straight  sets.  While 
Pell  played  a  strong  game,  Larned's  defeat  was  undoubtedly 
caused  by  an  attack  of  rheumatism  in  the  knees,  which  made  it 
very  difficult  for  him  to  run  about  the  court.  The  Columbia  man 
was  easily  beaten  in  the  next  round  by  J.  A.  Allen,  of  Yale,  while 
Huntington  lost  to  Whitman,  and  Ward  was  beaten  by  Ware, 
also  in  this  round.  The  second  surprise  came  in  the  semi-final 
round,  when  Ware  unexpectedly  beat  Davis  by  three  sets  to  one, 
but  he  was  unable  to  get  a  set  against  Whitman  in  the  finals. 
Still  another  surprise  was  in  store  for  those  who  attended  the 
tournament,  for  in  the  doubles,  Davis  and  Ward,  hitherto  un- 
beaten, lost  to  Allen  and  McKittrick,  a  new  Yale-Harvard  com- 
bination, after  five  sets  of  the  most  exciting  kind  of  play. 

Allen  and  McKittrick  kept  up  their  good  work  in  the  final 
match,  and  won  the  first  two  sets  from  Whitman  and  Ware,  but 
were  finally  beaten  after  another  five-set  struggle.  Davis,  as 
well  as  Larned,  was  distinctly  off-color  during  this  tournament.

17.  This  tournament,  following  immediately  after  the  Canadian

final  round  by  three  sets  to  one,  but  against  Champion  Whitman 
the  following  day,  he  was  beaten  by  a  similar  score.  In  the 
doubles  J.  P.  Paret  and  R.  D.  Little  won  the  state  championship 
after  a  close  match  in  the  semi-finals  against  the  crack  local  pair, 
A.  D.  Jenney  and  E.  H.  Lewis,  and  a  well-played  final  against 
E.  P.  Fischer  and  W.  C.  Grant.  In  the  handicap  singles,  the

each  time  when  it  came  to  a  close  finish,  and  in  the  challenge

the    championship   after    having    lost   the    first   two    sets.      The

The  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  state  of 
Rhode  Island,  which  was  held  at  Providence  the  first  week  in 
September,  resulted  in  the  usual  duel  between  Malcolm  Chace  and

this  time  Budlong  finally  won  after  the  score  had  been  two  sets

one.  Hackett  and  Allen  won  the  doubles  easily,  while  in  the 
handicap  singles,  Paret  (owe  ^  30)  won  first  prize,  after  con- 
ceding the  extreme  odds  from  the  virtual  scratch  mark.  In  the 
handicap  doubles,  Paret  and  Wyeth  (owe  15)  were  the  successful 
team.  Two  matches  in  particular  caused  considerable  surprise.

THE  WENTWORTH  TOURNAMENT. 

The  annual  open  tournament  of  the  Hotel  Wentworth  was  held 
at  New  Castle,  N.  H.,  beginning  August  i.  Although  the  entries 
were  small  in  number,  they  included  many  of  the  crack  players, 
and  the  matches  furnished  some  exciting  play.  The  winner  turned 
up  in  Beals  Wright,  the  Harvard  interscholastic  champion,  who 
beat  Davidson,  Fischer  and  Budlong,  all  in  straight  sets,  to  the 
surprise  of  even  his  most  ardent  admirers.  The  feature  of  the 
tournament,  however,  was  the  final  match  in  the  doubles,  which 
lasted  for  many  hours  through  the  morning  and  afternoon  of  the 
last  day.  W.  S.  Bond,  of  Chicago,  and  E.  P.  Fischer,  of  New 
York,  were  opposed  by  Beals  Wright,  of  Harvard,  and  H.  H. 
Hackett,  of  Yale.  The  former  pair  won  the  first  set  after  a  close 
finish,  but  the  second  was  won  by  Wright  and  Hackett,  who  also 
captured  the  third  after  24  games  had  been  played.  Bond  and 
Fischer  were  too  steady  in  the  end  for  the  younger  players,  and 
finally  won  the  fourth  and  fifth  sets,  taking  first  prizes.

THE  MAGNOLIA  TOURNAMENT. 

The  newly-established  open  tournament  for  the  MagnoHa  chal- 
lenge cup  was  held  at  Magnolia  Beach,  Mass.,  beginning  July  i8. 
The  entry  list  was  a  strong  one,  but  the  delay  in  finishing  the 
Western  championship  tournament  at  Chicago  the  week  before, 
made  a  number  of  the  best  players  default.  Dwight  F.  Davis,  the 
Harvard  expert,  was  the  star  of  the  tournament,  and  he  won  the 
Magnolia  Cup,  after  close  matches  with  Ward,  Mansfield  and 
Wright,  by  beating  Budlong  for  it  in  three  straight  sets.  The 
surprise  of  the  tournament  was  the  defeat  of  Leo  Ware  in  the 
semi-final  round  by  young  Beals  Wright,  who  was  then  looming 
up  rapidly  among  the  cracks.  Hackett  and  Allen  reached  Mag- 
nolia Beach  from  the  West  in  time  to  take  part  in  the  doubles,  but 
they  were  beaten  in  the  finals  by  Davis  and  Ward.

THE  BRITISH  CHAMPIONSHIP  TOURNAMENT. 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  All-England 
was  held  as  usual  at  Wimbledon,  just  outside  of  London,  begin- 
ning June  19.  The  entry  list  was  larger  than  usual,  including 
thirty-seven  names,  and  among  them  being  that  of  Clarence  Ho- 
bart,  the  famous  American  expert,  who  made  a  second  campaign 
on  British  courts  with  considerable  success  last  year.  The  first 
surprise  of  what  proved  to  be  a  very  surprising  meeting,  was  the 
unexpected  defeat  in  the  second  round  by  Dr.  W.  V.  Eaves,  who 
played  in  America  three  years  ago.  Eaves  was  one  of  the  prime 
favorites  for  the  first  honors,  but  was  totally  unable  to  do  himself 
justice  the  first  day,  after  a  long  railway  journey,  and  was  beaten 
by  M.  J.  G.  Ritchie  in  a  five-set  struggle. 

Hobart  beat  C.  R.  Dickson  in  the  second  round,  and  J.  H. 
Crispe  in  the  third  round.  In  the  fourth  round,  however,  when  he 
met  H.  R.  Barrett,  under  the  pseudonym  of  "A  Player,"  and  was 
beaten  after  a  very  exciting  match  by  8-6,  7-5,  6-4;  "Player"  lost 
to  S.  H.  Smith,  the  famous  base-line  expert,  in  the  semi-final 
round  after  five  sets  of  brilliant  play,  and  then  to  the  surprise  of 
all,  Smith  was  beaten  in  the  finals  by  A.  W.  Gore,  by  three  sets 
to  one.  In  the  challenge  round  for  the  All-England  champion- 
ship. Gore  was  beaten  by  R.  F.  Doherty,  the  previous  holder  of  the 
title,  after  he  had  won  the  first  two  sets  and  secured  a  lead  on  the 
third.  Gore  is  a  base-line  player,  and  Doherty's  brilliant  net 
play  was  too  much  for  him  in  the  end. 

In  the  doubles  Hobart  played  with  H.  A.  Nisbet,  one  of  the 
English  experts  who  was  seen  in  America  three  years  ago,  and 
they  won  first  honors  in  the  all-comers'  tournament.  In  the  sec- 
ond round,  they  met  the  famous  Allen  brothers,  one  of  the  strong- 
est double  teams  in  Great  Britain,  and  beat  them  in  straight  sets. 
The  American  and  his  partner  beat  G.  M.  Simond  and  C.  A. 
Caridia  in  the  semi-final  round,  after  losing  the  first  two  sets,

while  in  the  finals  they  beat  Gore  and  Barrett  in  straight  sets. 
The  famous  Doherty  brothers  were  too  strong  for  the  Anglo- 
American  combination,  and  won  in  straight  sets  from  their 
challengers.  Mrs.  G.  W.  Hilliard  won  back  her  former  title  as 
champion  of  All-England,  by  winning  the  all-comers'  tourna- 
ment, and  beating  Miss  C.  Cooper,  the  previous  holder,  in  two 
straight  sets.

3.  The  choice  of  sides,  and  the  right  to  serve  in  the  first 
game,  shall  be  decided  by  toss ;  provided  that,  if  the  winner 
of  the  toss  choose  the  right  to  serve  the  other  player  shall 
have  choice  of  sides,  and  vice  versa,  or  the  winner  of  the 
toss  may  insist  upon  a  choice  by  his  opponent.  If  one 
player  choose  the  Court  the  other  may  elect  not  to  serve. 

4.  The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net ; 
the  player  who  first  delivers  the  ball  shall  be  called  the 
server,  and  the  other  the  striker-out. 

5.  At  the  end  of  the  first  game  the  striker-out  shall  be- 
come server,  and  the  server  shall  become  striker-out;  and 
so  on  alternately  in  all  the  subsequent  games  of  the  set,  or 
series  of  sets. 

6.  The  server  shall  stand  with  both  feet  behind;  i.  e., 
farther  from  the  net  than  the  base  line.  It  is  not  a  fault  if 
one  of  the  server's  feet  does  not  touch  the  ground  at  the 
moment  at  which  the  service  is  delivered.  He  shall  place 
both  feet  firmly  on  the  ground  immediately  before  serv- 
ing, and  shall  not  take  a  running  or  walking  start.  He 
shall  deliver  the  service  from  the  right  and  left  courts  al- 
ternately, beginning  from  the  right. 

7.  The  ball  served  must  drop  between  the  service  line, 
half-court  line,  and  side  line  of  the  Court,  diagonally  oppo- 
site to  that  from  which  it  was  served. 

8.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  server  fail  to  strike  the  ball,  or  if 
the  ball  served  drop  in  the  net,  or  beyond  the  service  line, 
or  out  of  Court,  or  in  the  wrong  Court,  or  if  the  server  do 
not  stand  as  directed  by  law  6. 

9.  A  fault  cannot  be  taken. 

10.  After  a  fault  the  server  shall  serve  again  from  the 
same  Court  from  which  he  served  that  fault,  unless  it  was 
a  fault  because  he  served  from  the  wrong  Court. 

11.  A  fault  cannot  be  claimed  after  the  next  service  is 
delivered. 

12.  The   server   shall   not  serve  till   the   striker-out  is 


70  SPALDING  S  ATHLETIC   LIBRARY. 

ready.     If  the  latter  attempt  to  return  the  service  he  shall 
be  deemed  ready. 

13.  A  service  or  fault  delivered  when  the  striker-out  is 
not  ready  counts  for  nothing. 

14.  The  service  shall  not  be  volleyed — that  is,  taken  be- 
fore it  has  touched  the  ground. 

15.  A  ball  is  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  ex- 
cept as  provided  for  in  law  8. 

16.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net ; 
but  a  service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall 
count  for  nothing. 

17.  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the 
service,  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in 
play;  or  if  he  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  so  that 
it  drops  outside  of  his  opponent's  court;  or  if  he  otherwise 
lose  a  stroke,  as  provided  by  law  20. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two 
consecutive  faults;  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  ball  in  play; 
or  if  he  return  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of 
his  opponent's  Court;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as 
provided  by  law  20. 

19.  A  ball  falling  on  a  line  is  regarded  as  falling  in  the 
Court  bounded  by  that  line. 

20.  Either  player  loses  a  stroke  if  the  ball  touch  him,  or 
anything  that  he  wears  or  carries,  except  his  racket  in  the 
act  of  striking;  or  if  he  touch  the  ball  with  his  racket  more 
than  once ;  or  if  he  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports 
while  the  ball  is  in  play;  or  if  he  volley  the  ball  before  it 
has  passed  the  net. 

21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident  not 
within  his  control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  "let."  But 
where  a  permanent  fixture  of  the  Court  is  the  cause  of  the 
accident,  the  point  shall  be  counted.  The  benches  and 
chairs  placed  around  the  Court  shall  be  considered  per- 
manent fixtures.  If,  however,  a  ball  in  play  strike  a  per- 
manent fixture  of  the  Court  (other  than  the  net  or  posts) 
before  it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost;  if  after  it 
has  touched  the  ground,  the  point  shall  be  counted.

22.  On  either  player  winning  his  first  stroke,  the  score 
is  called  15  for  that  player;  on  either  player  winning  his 
second  stroke,  the  score  is  called  30  for  that  player;  on 
either  player  winning  his  third  stroke,  the  score  is  called  40 
for  that  player ;  and  the  fourth  stroke  won  by  either  player 
is  scored  game  for  that  player,  except  as  below :  If  both 
players  have  won  three  strokes  the  score  is  called  deuce, 
and  the  next  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advan- 
tage for  that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next 
stroke,  he  wins  the  game;  if  he  lose  the  next  stroke,  the 
score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until  one  player  wins  the 
two  strokes  immediately  following  the  score  of  deuce,  when 
game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set; 
except  as  below :  If  both  players  win  five  games,  the  score 
is  called  games  all;  and  the  next  game  won  by  either  player 
is  scored  advantage  game  for  that  player.  If  the  same 
player  win  the  next  game  he  wins  the  set;  if  he  lose  the 
next  game,  the  score  returns  to  games  all ;  and  so  on  until 
either  player  wins  the  two  games  immediately  following 
the  score  of  games  all,  when  he  wins  the  set.  But  the  com- 
mittee having  charge  of  any  tournament  may  in  their  dis- 
cretion modify  this  rule  by  the  omission  of  advantage  sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  every 
set;  but  the  umpire,  on  appeal  from  either  player  before 
the  toss  for  choice,  shall  direct  the  players  to  change  sides 
at  the  end  of  the  first,  third,  fifth,  and  every  succeeding 
alternate  game  of  each  set ;  but  if  the  appeal  be  made  after 
the  toss  for  choice,  the  umpire  may  only  direct  the  players 
to  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third,  fifth,  and  every 
succeeding  alternate  game  of  the  odd  or  deciding  set.  If 
the  players  change  Courts  in  the  alternate  games  through- 

.  out  the  match  as  above,  they  shall  play  in  the  first  gam' 
of  each  set  after  the  first  in  the  Courts  in  which  they  n 
spectively  did  not  play  in  the  first  game  of  the  set  imme- 
diately preceding. 


72  SPALDING  S   ATHLETIC    LIBRARY. 

25.  When  a  series  of  sets  is  played,  the  player  who 
served  in  the  last  game  of  one  set  shall  be  striker-out  in  the 
first  game  of  the  next. 

26.  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous  from  the 
first  service  till  the  match  be  concluded;  provided,  how- 
ever, that  between  all  sets  after  the  second  set  either  player 
is  entitled  to  a  rest,  which  shall  not  exceed  seven  minutes; 
and  provided,  further,  that  in  case  of  an  unavoidable  acci- 
dent, not  within  the  control  of  the  contestants,  a  cessation 
of  play  which  shall  not  exceed  two  minutes  may  be  allowed 
between  points ;  but  this  proviso  shall  be  strictly  construed, 
and  the  privilege  never  granted  for  the  purpose  of  allowing 
a  player  to  recover  his  strength  or  wind.  The  umpire  in 
his  discretion  may  at  any  time  postpone  the  match  on  ac- 
count of  darkness  or  condition  of  the  ground  or  weather. 
In  any  case  of  postponement  the  previous  score  shall  hold 
good.  When  the  play  has  ceased  for  more  than  an  hour 
the  player,  who  at  the  cessation  thereof  was  in  the  Court 
first  chosen,  shall  have  the  choice  of  Courts  on  the  recom- 
mencement of  play.  He  shall  stay  in  the  Court  he  chooses 
for  the  remainder  of  the  set.  The  last  two  sentences  of 
this  rule  do  not  apply  when  the  players  change  every  alter- 
nate game  as  provided  by  rule  24. 

27.  If  a  player  serve  out  of  his  turn  the  umpire,  as  soon 
as  the  mistake  is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  player  to  serve 
who  ought  to  have  served.  But  all  strokes  scored  before 
such  discovery  shall  be  counted.  If  a  game  shall  have 
been  completed  before  such  discovery,  then  the  service  in 
the  next  alternate  game  shall  be  delivered  by  the  player 
who  did  not  serve  out  of  his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular 
rotation. 

28.  There  shall  be  a  referee  for  every  tournament,  whose 
name  shall  be  stated  in  the  circular  announcing  such  tour- 
nament. He  shall  have  general  charge  of  the  matches 
under  the  instructions  and  advice  of  the  Managing  Com- 
mittee, with  such  power  and  authority  as  may  be  given  by 


Spalding's  athletic  library.  73 

these  rules  and  by  said  committee.  He  shall  notify  the 
committee  in  case  he  intend  to  leave  the  grounds  during 
the  matches,  and  the  committee  shall  appoint  a  substitute 
to  act  with  like  power  during  his  absence.  There  shall  be 
an  umpire  for  each  match  and  as  many  linesmen  as  th« 
players  desire.  The  umpire  may  act  as  linesman  also. 
The  umpire  shall  have  general  charge  of  the  match  and 
shall  decide  upon  and  call  lets,  and  also  decide  whether  the 
player  took  the  ball  on  the  first  or  second  bounce.  The 
umpire  shall  also  decide  any  question  of  interpretation  or 
construction  of  the  rules  that  may  arise.  The  decision  of 
the  umpire  upon  any  question  of  fact,  or  where  a  discre- 
tion is  allowed  to  him  under  these  rules,  shall  be  final. 
Any  player,  however,  may  protest  against  any  interpreta- 
tion or  construction  of  the  rules  by  the  umpire  and  appeal 
to  the  referee.  The  decision  of  the  referee  upon  such  ap- 
peal should  be  final. 

The  Court  shall  be  divided  between  the  linesmen,  and  it 
shall  be  their  only  duty  to  decide  each  for  his  share  of  the 
Court  where  the  ball  touched  the  ground,  except,  however, 
the  linesmen  for  the  base  line,  who  shall  also  call  foot 
faults.  The  linesman's  decision  shall  be  final.  If  a  lines- 
man is  unable  to  give  a  decision,  because  he  did  not  see,  or 
is  uncertain  of  the  fact,  the  umpire  shall  decide  or  direct 
the  stroke  to  be  played  again. 

29.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and 
four-handed  games,  except  as  below : 

THE  THREE-HANDED  AND  FOUR-HANDED 
GAMES. 

30.  For  the  three-handed  and  four-handed  games  the 
Court  shall  be  36  feet  in  width;  4>4  feet  inside  the  side 
lines,  and  parallel  with  them,  are  drawn  the  service  side 
lines  K  M  and  L  N.  The  service  lines  are  not  drawn  be- 
yond the  point  at  which  they  meet  the  service  side  lines,  as 
shown  in  the  diagram. 

31.  In  the  three-handed  game  the  single  player  shall 
serve  in  every  alternate  game.

32.  In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have  the 
right  to  serve  in  the  first  game  shall  decide  which  partner 
shall  do  so ;  and  the  opposing  pair  shall  decide  in  like  man- 
ner for  the  second  game.  The  partner  of  the  player  who 
served  in  the  first  game  shall  serve  in  the  third,  and  the 
partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  the  second  game  shall 
serve  in  the  fourth,  and  the  same  order  shall  be  main- 
tained in  all  the  subsequent  games  of  the  set. 

33.  At  the  beginning  of  the  next  set  either  partner  of 
the  pair  which  struck  out  in  the  last  game  of  the  last  set 
may  serve,  and  the  same  privilege  is  given  to  their  oppo- 
nents in  the  second  game  of  the  new  set.

34.  The     players     shall     take     the     service     alternately 

throughout  the  game ;  a  player  cannot  receive  a  service  de- 
livered to  his  partner ;  and  the  order  of  service  and  strik- 
ing out  once  established  shall  not  be  altered,  nor  shall  the 
striker-out  change  Courts  to  receive  the  service  till  the  end 
of  the  set. 

35.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  do  not  drop  between 
the  service  line,  half-court  line  and  service  side  line  of  the 
Court,  diagonally  opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served. 

36.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  do  not  drop  as  pro- 
vided in  law  35,  or  if  it  touch  the  server's  partner  or  any- 
thing he  wears  or  carries.

lY^   RULES  FOR  HANDICAPPING    ^y  I 


At  the  annual  meeting  of  the  United  States  National 
Lawn  Tennis  Association,  1897,  it  was  formally  decided  to 
adopt  the  English  system  of  handicapping  by  sixths  of 
fifteen,  but  without  the  use  of  the  differential  tables.  These 
were  abolished  the  year  before,  when  the  quarter-fifteen 
system  supplanted  the  old  method  of  handicapping  with 
bisques.  The  official  method  now,  therefore,  is  by  sixths 
of  fifteen,  both  owed  and  given,  and  the  rules  for  using 
these  handicaps  are  as  follows: 

GIVEN  ODDS. 

One-sixth  of  fifteen  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  given  by  the  bet- 
ter to  the  poorer  player  on  the  second,  eighth,  fourteenth 
and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  of  fifteen  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the 
second,  fourth,  eighth,  tenth  and  corresponding  games  in 
each  set. 

Three-sixths  of  fifteen  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke 
given  on  the  second,  fourth,  sixth  and  every  other  alter- 
nate game  on  each  set. 

Four-sixths  of  fifteen  (4-6)  is  one  stroke. given  on  the 
second,  fourth,  sixth,  eighth,  tenth,  eleventh  twelfth  and 
corresponding  games  on  each  set. 

Five-sixths  of  fifteen  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  given  on  the 
second,  third,  fourth,  fifth,  sixth,  eighth,  ninth,  tenth, 
eleventh,  twelfth  and  corresponding  games  on  each  set. 

Fifteen  (15)  Is  one  stroke  given  on  every  game  of  each 

set. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (iS-i)  is  two  strokes  given  on  the 
same  games  as  for  one-sixth,  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the 

others. 
Fifteen  and  two-sixths   (15.2)   is  two  strokes  given  on 


"jt  Spalding's  athletic  library. 

the  same  games  as  for  two-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each 
of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty)  is  two 
strokes  given  on  the  same  games  as  for  three-sixths,  and 
one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4)  is  two  strokes  given  on 
the  same  games  as  for  four-sixths,  and  one  stroke  on  each 
of  the  others. 

Fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5)  is  two  strokes  on  the  same 
games  as  for  five-sixths  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the 
others. 

Thirty  (30)  is  two  strokes  on  each  game. 

Thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1),  thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2), 
thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- forty),  thirty  and 
four-sixths  (30.4),  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and  forty 
(40),  are  three  strokes  and  two  given  on  the  corresponding 
games  of  each  set,  as  in  the  fifteen  series. 

OWED   ODDS. 

Owed  (or  minus)  odds  can  also  be  used  in  exactly  the 
same  quantities,  the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better 
player  is  required  to  earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  be- 
gins to  score,  while,  in  the  case  of  given  odds,  the  poorer 
player  is  given  his  handicap  before  play  starts.  These 
owed  odds  may  be  used  either  in  conjunction  with  the 
given  odds  or  separately.  In  order  that  the  handicaps  may 
occur  as  seldom  as  possible  in  the  same  games,  when  two 
players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes  odds  and  the  other  re- 
ceives them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes  are  paid 
differ  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds : 

One-sixth  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh, 
thirteenth  and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third, 
seventh,  ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the 
first,  third,  fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 


SPALDING  S   ATHLETIC   LIBRARY.  // 

Four-sixths  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third, 
fifth,  sixth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third, 
fourth,  fifth,  sixth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Fifteen  (15)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1),  fifteen  and  two-sixths 
(15.2),  fifteen  and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty),  fifteen 
and  four-sixths  (15.4),  fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5)  thirty 
(30),  thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1),  thirty  and  two-sixths 
(30.2),  thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- forty),  thirty 
and  four-sixths  (30.4),  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and 
forty  (40),  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the 
larger  handicaps  in  the  table  for  given  odds  correspond  to 
the  fractions  of  fifteen  in  that  table. 


INSTRUCTIONS  FOR  HANDICAPPING. 
When  two  players  meet,  both  of  whom  owe  odds,  or 
when  both  are  in  receipt  of  odds,  the  smaller  handicap  is 
subtracted  from  the  greater,  and  the  difference  between  the 
handicaps  is  the  amount  the  better  player  must  owe  or  give 
to  the  poorer,  as  the  case  may  be.  Should  two  players 
meet,  one  of  whom  owes  and  the  other  receives  odds,  each 
retains  his  original  handicap,  and  the  tables  are  so  figured 
out  that  the  handicaps  will  come  on  opposite  games  so  far 
as  possible.  As  an  illustration  of  this,  suppose  a  player 
(A)  owing  15.3  meets  another  (B)  receiving  3-6.  On  the 
first  game,  A  owes  30  and  B  starts  from  scratch,  and  on 
the  second,  A  owes  15  and  B  receives  15,  these  two  differ- 
ent handicaps  alternating  on  the  games  throughout  each 
set,  the  difference  between  the  players  being  always  the 
same,  30.  A  begins  to  count  on  the  even  games  when  he 
has  made  his  second  stroke,  while  B  counts  30  when  he 
scores  his  first,  for  one  is  given  to  him  by  handicap.  On 
the  odd  games,  A  does  not  begin  to  score  until  his  third 
stroke,  while  his  adversary  counts  15  when  he  wins  hh 
first  ace. 


78  Spalding's  athletic  library. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappcrs  to  pursue  is  to 
sort  out  the  entries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap  into 
classes  according  to  the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then 
select  the  class  with  the  greatest  number  of  players  in  it 
and  place  them  on  scratch,  handicapping  all  of  the  other 
players  either  behind  or  in  advance  of  scratch  by  owed  or 
given  odds,  so  as  to  make  all  even  at  the  odds. 

In  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as 
compared  with  the  scratch  men  should  first  be  considered, 
and  then  as  compared  with  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals 
in  the  tables  of  odds.  Each  player  might  meet  any  of  the 
others,  and  the  object  of  handicapping  is  to  give  him  an 
exactly  even  chance,  no  matter  whom  his  opponent  may  be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15,  or 
any  fraction  of  it,  than  it  is  to  give  it,  and  when  odds  of  30 
are  given,  the  poorer  player's  score  has  already  reached 
pretty  near  the  end  of  the  game,  and  the  difference  between 
him  and  the  best  men  must  be  very  great  to  give  the  latter 
an  even  chance,  should  they  meet 

It  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorest  players  over 
30.3  (half- forty),  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the 
given  odds  run  higher  than  30.  If  the  difference  between 
the  best  and  the  poorest  players  is  very  great,  place  the 
latter  as  far  as  necessary  behind  scratch,  but  do  not  ad- 
vance the  former  to  more  than  30,  or  30.3  in  the  most  ex- 
treme cases. 

It  is  generally  advisable  to  "seed"  the  draw  in  handicap 
tournaments  so  that  the  players  in  each  class  shall  be  sepa- 
rated as  far  as  possible  one  from  another.  In  order  to 
preserve  the  element  of  handicap  matches,  as  few  oppor= 
tunities  as  possible  should  be  given  for  players  to  meet  at 
even  odds.  To  insure  this,  the  players  behind  scratch 
should  be  equally  divided  between  the  top  and  bottom  of 
the  draw,  and  those  in  advance  of  scratch  also  treated  in 
the  same  manner.  If  there  are  many  in  each  class,  it  is 
often  wise  to  split  the  draw  up  into  quarters,  so  that  the 
and  as  large  a  proportion  of  the  matches  as  possible  will 
players  of  even  ability  shall  be  kept  as  far  apart  as  possible, 
be  played  with  odds  between  the  contestants.

HAND  TENNIS. 


BY  E.  J.   GIANNINI. 


description. 

The  game,  which  may  be  played  either  in  singles  or  doubles,  is 
as  follows : 

"A"  serves  the  ball  to  the  opposing  player.  "B,"  who  stands 
diagonally  opposite.  "B"  attempts  to  return  the  ball  over  the  net 
and  within  bounds,  and  failing,  "A"  scores  one  point.  If  "B  ' 
returns  the  ball,  and  "A"  fails  to  return  it  to  "B,"  it  is  "hand  out/' 
and  no  points  are  scored.  "B"  then  serves,  and  play  continues  as 
above  described.  The  player  first  scoring  twenty-five  points  wins 
the  game. 

In  both  singles  and  doubles,  the  server  alternates  from  right  to 
left  court,  until  losing  the  ball. 

rules. 

1.  The  server  must  stand  back  of  the  base  line,  within  the 
limits  of  the  width  of  the  court. 

2.  The  ball  must  be  bounced  to  the  floor  outside  of  the  base 
line  before  striking  it  on  the  serve. 

3.  The  ball  may  be  returned  after  the  serve  either  on  the  first 
bounce  or  on  the  fly ;  on  the  serve  the  ball  must  be  returned  on  the 
first  bounce. 

4.  The  ball  may  be  struck  with  either  hand,  but  not  with  both 
together. 

5.  In  serving,  two  tries  are  allowed,  if  necessary,  to  place  the 
ball  in  the  proper  court.    If  two  faults  result,  it  is  "hand  out." 

6.  A  "Let"  is  the  same  as  in  lawn  tennis. 

7.  In  serving,  if  the  ball  goes  into  the  net,  it  is  "hand  out." 

8.  Stepping  over  the  foul  line  at  the  net,  striking  the  net  with 
the  hand  or  reaching  over  the  net  is  foul. 


82 


SPALDING  S    ATHLETIC    LIBRARY. 


9.  A  ball  which  rebounds  by  striking  any  part  of  the  person 
other  than  the  hand  is  foul. 

10.  A  ball  striking  on  the  boundary  or  court  lines  is  good. 

11.  Any  fouls  committed  by  the  server  or  serving  side  is  "hand 
out." 

12.  "Hand  out"  is  the  loss  of  the  ball  to  the  opposing  side.

LAWN    HOCKEY 

THIS  game  is  of  recent  introduction,  and  has  become  quite  popular 
abro'ad  It  is  bound  to  meet  with  great  favor  in  this  country  as  it 
may  be  played  by  both  sexes  Owing  to  the  larger  number  en- 
gaged at  one  time,  eleven  to  a  side,  it  affords  to  a  greater  degree  all  the 
enjoyable  social  features  of  Lawn  Tennis. 

Lawn  Hockey  is  an  elaboration  of  •'shinny  on  your  own  side,"  and 
consequently  will  be  quickly  understood  and  appreciated  by  the  boys 
■  ■  girls.

The  "Silvenown  "  Ball  is  almost  exclusively  used  on  the  principal  links  of  Scotland  and  Enniano.  and  is 
universally  conceded  the  best  ball  made.  Constructed  of  pure  gutla  percha,  and  by  a  process  known  only  to  the 
ni.inufacturers.  ii  combines  not  only  uniformity  of  weight  and  resiliency,  but  extreme  durability  and  perfection  of 
(light.  These  essentials  of  a  perfect  Goll  Ball  are  not  so  happily  combined  in  any  other  make,  and  have  justly 
earned  for  it  a  reputation  not  only  at  the  home  of  the  golfers,  but  in  every  couniry  where  the  ancient  game  is 
played.  We  have  the  exclusive  control  of  this  ball  for  the  United  Slates,  and  guarantee  each  ball  furnished  by  us  to
