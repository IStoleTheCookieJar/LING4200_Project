§  KNOW  ALL  MEN  BY  THESE  PRESENTS: 

COUNTY  OF  TARRANT  § 

This  AMENDMENT  AND  RATIFICATION  OF  OIL,  GAS  AND  MINERAL  LEASE  is  executed 
by  Thomas  R,  Proctor  and  Mary  Beth  Proctor,  husband  and  wife,  to  be  effective  as  of  July  10,  2008. 

WITNESSETH: 

Whereas,  Thomas  R.  Proctor  and  Mary  Beth  Proctor,  husband  and  wife,  as  Lessor,  executed  and 
delivered  unto  Axia  Land  Services,  L.L.C.,  as  Lessee,  that  certain  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease  (the  "Lease"),

of  Tarrant  County,  Texas;  and 

Whereas,  at  the  time  the  Lease  was  entered  into,  the  description  of  the  lands  contained  in  the  Lease 
was  believed  by  Lessor  and  Lessee  to  cover,  and  was  intended  to  cover,  certain  lands  owned  by  Lessor;  and 

Whereas,  since  the  execution,  delivery,  and  recording  of  the  Lease,  it  has  been  discovered  that  the 
description  of  lands  contained  in  the  Lease  does  not  adequately  describe  the  lands  Lessor  intended  to  lease  to 
Lessee.  Lessor  and  Lessee  desire  to  amend  and  correct  the  description  of  lands  contained  in  the  Lease  to 
accurately  identify  the  lands  to  be  covered  by  the  Lease,  and  to  ratify  and  confirm  the  Lease,  as  amended. 

Now,  Therefore,  for  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  are  hereby 
acknowledged  by  Lessor,  the  undersigned  Lessor  does  hereby  amend  the  Lease  as  follows: 

The  description  of  the  lands  covered  by  the  following  Tract  is  deleted  in  its  entirety  and  the 
following  description  shall  be  substituted  in  its  place: 
f)  icy  -»

Volume  388-36,  Page  60,  Plat  Records  of  Tarrant  County,  Texas. 

Lessor  ratifies,  adopts,  and  confirms  the  Lease  and  extends  the  Lease  to  cover  the  lands  described  in 
this  Amendment  and  Ratification  of  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease,  as  if  the  description  of  lands  set  out  above 
had  been  originally  included  in  the  Lease. 

In  the  event  of  a  conflict  between  the  provisions  contained  in  this  instrument  and  any  other 
provisions  contained  in  the  Lease,  the  provisions  contained  in  this  instrument  shall  prevail  to  the  extent  of 
such  conflict;  in  all  other  respects  the  Lease  shall  remain  in  full  force  and  effect. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  for  good  and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and  sufficiency  of  which  is 
hereby  acknowledged,  the  undersigned  Lessor  does  hereby  agree  and  declare  that  the  Lease,  as  amended 
herein,  is  binding  upon  the  undersigned  Lessor  and  is  a  valid  and  subsisting  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease.  For 
the  same  consideration  recited  above,  the  undersigned  Lessor  does  hereby  adopt,  ratify  and  confirm  the 


Lease,  as  amended  herein,  and  does  hereby  lease,  let  and  demise  to  the  Lessee  the  lands  described  in  the 
Lease,  as  amended  herein,  subject  to  and  in  accordance  with  all  of  the  terms  and  provisions  of  said  Lease,  as 
amended  herein. 

This  Amendment  and  Ratification  of  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease  shall  be  binding  upon  the  undersigned  and 
their  respective  successors  and  assigns. 

This  Amendment  and  Ratification  of  Oil,  Gas  and  Mineral  Lease  is  executed  as  of  the  date  of
