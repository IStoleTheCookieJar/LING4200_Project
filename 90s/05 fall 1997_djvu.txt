PUBLISHED  BY  COLLEGE  RELATIONS  AND  DEVELOPMENT  FOR  THE  COLLEGE  COMMUNITY  â€¢  SEPTEMBER  5,  1 997 


Judson:  Plattsburgh  State  Off  to  a  Great  Fall  Semester 


Terming  it  a  "turn-around  year,"  Platts- 
burgh State  President  Horace  Judson  told 
faculty  and  staff  at 
the  fall  opening 
breakfast  last  Fri- 
day the  college  was 
in  a  better  shape 
heading  into  the  se- 
mester than  in  his 
previous  three  years 
as  president. 
Judson  identi- 


Judson 


fied  several  positive  signs,  including:  state 
funding  for  the  college  at  the  same  level  as 
last  year;  a  tentative  faculty  contract  with 
salary  increases;  and  an  increase  in  new  full- 
time  faculty.  He  said,  "We  are  cautiously 

Graduates,  Students 
Score  High  on  State 
Teacher  Exams 

If  the  New  York  State  Teacher  Certifi- 
cation Examination  is  any  indication  of  how 
effective  Plattsburgh  State' s  programs  are  in 
preparing  students  to  become  teachers,  then 
the  programs  are  a  shining  success. 

More  than  200  students  and  recent  gradu- 
ates from  Plattsburgh  State  took  the  test  in 
May  and  97  percent  passed  the  exams;  com- 
pared to  the  statewide  average  for  all  SUNY 
colleges  of  92  percent. 

Dr.  Raymond  Domenico,  director  of  the 
Center  for  Educational  Studies  and  Services, 
said  the  results  of  the  nine  exams  given  are 
a  great  measure  of  the  college's  effective- 
ness in  educating  teachers. 
"  The  scores  from  our  students  demon- 
strated a  higher  percentage  of  passing  that  is 
above  all  other  teacher  preparation  programs 
in  New  York  State,"  said  Domenico.  "We 
are  really  pleased  with  the  results." 

The  lowest  passing  percentages  of  ex

optimistic  that  we  will  have  subsequent  fall 
semesters  like  this  one." 

This  year,  the  president  said  the  college 
would  work  toward  meeting  several  initia- 
tives, including:  expanding  the  institution's 
commitment  to  diversity  among  faculty,  staff 
and  students;  increasing  institutional  grants 
for  faculty  research;  developing  a  non-based 
salary  merit  program  fund;  and  revising  a 
faculty/staff  development  plan. 

"This  college's  commitment  to  diver- 
sity is  clear  and  long-standing  and  precedes 
my  tenure  here;"said  Judson,  in  reference  to 
diversity  and  equity.  He  said  to  begin  the 
effort  to  meet  these  goals,  several  approaches 
would  be  undertaken.  An  administrator  for 
diversity  initiatives  would  be  appointed  to 
initiate  a  faculty-mentoring  program  for 


minority  students,  establish  cooperative  pro- 
grams with  historically  black  colleges  and 
universities  as  well  as  develop  other  pro- 
grams and  activities. 

Judson  also  said  Plattsburgh  State  would 
continue  to  develop  and  refine  the  high  pri- 
ority goals  begun  last  year.  "I  will  encourage 
a  strong  focus  on  the  review  and  revision  of 
general  education  and  the  development  of  a 
more  formal  active  curriculum  review  and 
reform  effort,"  said  Judson. 

Enrollment  management,  marketing  and 
increases  in  out-of-state  and  international 
student  attendance  will  also  continue  to  be 
emphasized  along  with  fundraising  and 
grants  acquisition,  Judson  announced.

Judson 's  speech  at  the  opening  breakfast.) 


Speaker  Says  College  Needs  Diversity  for  Next  Century 

Patricia  Russell-McCloud  said  Plattsburgh  State  must  be  ready  for  the  21st 
century  if  the  college  is  to  be  successful  in  its  mission  to  prepare  students  for  the  next 
millennium. 

Russell-McCloud,  a  successful  attorney  and  president  of  Russell-McCloud 
Associates  in  Atlanta,  told  the  faculty  and  staff  in  attendance  at  the  Fall  Opening 
Breakfast,  Friday,  August  29,  that  the  college  must  begin  to  reflect  the  multicultural 
diversity  in  today's  society. 

"We  can  and  must  focus  on  21st  century  readiness.  Adjustments  will  have  to  be 
made,"  said  Russell-McCloud. 

She  questioned  whether  "Anglos,"  which  make  up  one-third  of  the  population, 
should  continue  to  be  the  ruling  majority.  "We  are  accustomed  to  Anglos,  but  it  will 
not  be  that  way  in  the  21st  Century."  Russell-McCloud  said  that  in  just  three  years, 
nearly  two-thirds  of  the  country  will  be  of  color.  People  of  Hispanic  origins  will  be 
the  largest  single  ethnic  group  in  American  society  followed  by  African-Americans. 

She  said  that  colleges  and  universities,  including  Plattsburgh  State,  must  begin 
to  stress  the  true  demographics  of  the  next  century  and  discuss  diversity  openly  and 
honestly. 

"Diversity  isn't  just  legalism,  or  preferential  treatment,  or  ethnic  celebrations,  or 
minorities  of  colors  and  women  talking  to  just  themselves,"  said  Russell-McCloud. 
"You  have  to  think  globally.  You  have  to  have  sessions  on  diversity  and  conflict 
resolution.  It  is  good  for  the  soul." 

She  said  there  is  an  urgency  to  her  message  if  Plattsburgh  State  is  be  ready  for 
change.  However,  Russell-McCloud  said,  "It  will  not  occur  unless  a  methodical  plan,

President  Says  Diversity  Among  Major  Initiatives  for  1997-98 


Editor's  Note:  President  Judson  addressed  the  faculty  and 
staff  at  the  11th  Annual  Fall  Faculty  Breakfast  on  August  29. 
This  is  the  full  text  of  his  speech. 

GOOD  MORNING! 

Welcome  back  for  the  start  of  the  '97- '98  academic  year. 

This  is  my  fourth  Fall  Opening,  and  it  is  significantly 
different  from  the  other  three. 

This  is  the  first  with  no  budget  cut  and  with  a  faculty 
contract,  and  with  salary  increases,  and  with  double-digit  new 
full-time  faculty  and  with  five  new  administrators. 

This  is  different.  And  we  are  cautiously  optimistic  that  we 
will  have  subsequent  Falls  like  this  one.  Hopefully,  this  is  a 
turn-around  year  leading  to  a  positive  period.  This  has  been 
a  very  difficult  decade  for  SUNY. 

The  last  two  years  have  been 
extraordinarily  difficult  because 
the  faculty  and  other  profession- 
als have  had  to  work  without  a 
contract,  without  raises,  and  even 
without  some  benefits.  Despite 
these  demoralizing  circumstances, 
you  have  continued  to  perform  in 

an  exemplary  fashion;  you  have  continued  to  move  this 
college  forward.  Your  dedication  and  commitment  did  not 
waver.  I  deeply  appreciate  your  commitment  and  your  profes- 
sionalism. And  I  thank  each  and  every  one  of  you. 

We  finished  the  '96-' 97  year  in  a  positive  position  finan- 
cially. We  moved  into  this  year  with  confidence  fiscally, 
because  we  created  a  $600,000  contingency  reserve,  enough 
to  deal  with  foreseeable  difficulties. 

We  start  this  year  with  steady-state  funding  from  the  state, 
with  that  contingency  reserve  and  with  a  positive  enrollment 
picture.  The  Foundation  raised  1.06  million  dollars  during 
'96-'97,  the  third  highest  in  history.  Importantly,  we  had  a 
record  number  of  alumni  donors  contributing  over  $400,000 
through  all  of  the  programs.  And  significantly,  faculty  and 
staff  contributed  from  all  sources,  $144,000. 

This  year  we  received  a  $  1 50,000  member  item,  thanks  to 
Senator  Stafford,  for  Environmental  Science,  Nursing  Tech- 
nology Projects,  and  equipment  for  Mass  Communication. 

The  major  construction  projects  on  campus  are  progress- 
ing very  well.  Despite  the  minor  inconveniences,  the  continu- 
ing upgrade  of  physical  facilities  and  our  campus  grounds  is 
critical  to  our  present  and  future  viability.  We  continue  to 
receive  compliments  about  the  attractiveness  of  our  campus. 
I  hope  we  have  these  minor  inconveniences  each  and  every 
year. 

This  past  academic  year,  we  had  several  noteworthy 


"  If  our  past  efforts  have  not  provided  the 
desired  result,  we  must  and  will  try  other 
more  effective  approaches,  some  which 
have  proven  successful  at  other  places.  " 
â€”  President  Horace  Judson  on  Diversity 


accomplishments  and  we  started  several  important  initiatives 
which  augur  well  for  our  strong  future .  Many  of  you  have  seen 
some  of  the  outputs  of  the  work  done  by  Creative  Communi- 
cation which  resulted  from  new  enrollment  management 
initiatives.  We  have  received  strong  positive  reactions  to  our 
new  recruitment  materials  and  our  marketing  efforts.  We 
enlarged  our  merit  scholarship  programs  for  new  freshmen 
and  transfer  students,  and  added  modest  programs  for  out-of- 
state  and  international  students.  Last  spring  we  began  plan- 
ning the  expansion  of  our  enrollment  management  plan  to 
include  out-of-state  and  international  students.  I  think  the 

implications  of  these  initiatives 
for  our  overall  enrollment  and 
student  diversity  are  obvious.  We 
believe  these  initiatives  will  have 
significant  positive  impacts  on 
our  Fall  '98  class,  quantitatively 
and  qualitatively. 

In  that  regard,  Plattsburgh 
State  supports  the  lowering  of  tuition  for  non-resident  stu- 
dents. A  marginal  cost  analysis  shows  that  it  would  benefit  the 
campus  fiscally  and  programmatically.  And  the  increases  in 
resources  and  geographic  and  cultural  diversity  would  benefit 
in-state  students  as  well.  Non-resident  students  would  still 
pay  significantly  more  than  resident  students.  This  campus 
once  enrolled  6700  students,  now  we  have  6000.  With 
additional  faculty,  we  can  accommodate  a  modest  increase  in 
students.  And  those  students  would  likely  have  higher  aca- 
demic quality  indicators.  And  importantly,  no  qualified  in- 
state students  will  be  denied  admission. 

The  Strategic  Plan  was  completed  last  year.  Drs.  Mowry 
and  Miller  are  co-chairs  of  a  task  force  which  is  developing  an 
operational  plan  as  a  companion  document  to  the  "Strategic 
Plan.  Dr.  Moran  will  say  more  about  this  during  his  remarks 
to  faculty  groups  later  today.  And  Drs.  Mowry,  Miller  and 
Moran  will  engage  you  in  continuing  discussions  in  the 
coming  weeks. 

Our  new  on-line  registration  system  used  last  spring  was 
highly  successful. 

For  '97-'98,  we  will  continue  to  develop  and  refine  the 
high  priority  initiatives  begun  last  year:  The  enrollment 
management,  marketing,  out-of-state  student  and  interna- 
tional student  initiatives.  Fundraising  and  grants  acquisition 
will,  of  course,  continue  to  be  very  high  priorities.  I  will 
encourage  a  strong  focus  on  the  review  and  revision  of  the 


[4] 


General  Education  Program  and  the  development  of  a  more 
formal,  active  curriculum  review  and  reform  effort. 

Over  the  next  two  years,  in  addition  to  the  across-the- 
board  raises,  we  are  scheduled  to  receive  three  discretionary 
increases  of  one  percent  each.  We  will  develop  a  plan  this 
semester  based  on  the  aggregate  total  of  the  three,  onr  percent 
increments  (approximately  $500,000).  The  plan  will  address 
structural  problems  in  our  base  salary,  including  compression 
of  salary  levels. 

This  semester: 

â™¦  We  will  revise,  approve,  and  initiate  a  faculty/staff 
Development  Plan  with  an  appropriate  budget,  in- 
cluding an  upgraded  faculty  travel  program. 

â™¦  We  will  initiate  a  modest  program  of  institutional 
grants  for  faculty  research.  These  would  be,  essen- 
tially, starter  grants. 

â™¦  After  we  determine  the  final  revenue  numbers  for  the 
fall  semester,  if  our  budget  situation  matches  our 
expectations,  we  will  develop  a  non-base  salary  merit 
program  funded  by  institutional  funds.  This  means 
the  merit  awards  would  not  be  part  of  the  base  salary. 
These  awards  would  be  in  addition  to  the  general  and 
discretionary  increases  provided  by  the  State.  I  will 
discuss  this  with  you  in  more  detail  during  this  semes- 
ter. You  may  receive  a  merit  award  every  year,  if  you 
performed  meritoriously  every  year. 

Last,  but  by  no  means  least,  last  year  we  started  several 
diversity  initiatives.  We  will  continue  and  expand  our  efforts 
to  fulfill  our  institutional  commitment  to  this  critical  area. 
Over  the  past  few  years  we  have  made  modest,  continuing 
progress  with  student  diversity.  And  we  have  made  similar 
modest  progress  with  gender  diversity  in  the  faculty  and  staff. 
But  we  must  do  more  in  both  of  these  areas.  However,  our 
progress  with  underrepresented  minorities  on  the  faculty  and 
staff  has  been  very  disappointing.  We  must  do  better  and  we 
will. 

This  college' s  commitment  is  clear  and  long-standing  and 
precedes  my  tenure  here.  During  the  last  presidential  search, 
you  clearly  expressed  the  requirement  that  the  president  must 
be  committed  to  diversity  and  equity.  I  read  the  Five- Year 
Plattsburgh  Plan  before  arriving  and  it  expressed  an  unequivo- 
cal commitment  to  diversity  and  even  included  some  diversity 
goals.  And  our  recent  Strategic  Plan  reiterates  and  re-empha- 
sizes that  commitment.  And  it  is  expressed  in  our  Mission. 
The  very  recent  review  by  Middle  States  of  our  Periodic 
Review  Report  is  very  laudatory  of  Plattsburgh  State.  Never- 
theless, it  does  cite  our  need  to  increase  the  diversity  of  our 
faculty,  staff  and  students.  Commitment  must  be  reflected  in 
real  results.  If  our  past  efforts  have  not  provided  the  desired 
result,  we  must  and  will  try  other  more  effective  approaches, 
some  which  have  proven  successful  at  other  places. 

This  year  we  will  appoint  an  Administrator  for  Diversity 


Initiatives  whose  responsibility  will  include:  the  initiation  of 
a  faculty  mentoring  program  for  minority  students;  establish- 
ing cooperative  programs  with  historic  black  colleges  and 
universities  in  several  areas;  and  developing  other  programs 
and  activities  as  well. 

We  have  a  primary  commitment  and  a  responsibility  for 
our  own  campus  community,  but  as  a  part  of  the  Plattsburgh 
and  North  Country  communities,  we  have  a  responsibility  for 
the  quality  of  those  communities  also.  And  we  have  an 
opportunity  to  partner  with  K- 12  educators. 

There  are  two  statements  which  I  think  cogently  express 
the  importance  of  and  the  rationale  for  our  diversity  commit- 
ment: 

â™¦  The  most  fundamental  rationale  for  student  di- 
versity in  higher  education  [is]  its  educational  value. 
Students  benefit  in  countless  ways  from  the  opportu- 
nity to  live  and  learn  among  peers  whose  perspectives 
and  experiences  differ  from  their  own.  (Neil  L. 
Rudenstine,  President  of  Harvard) 

â™¦  A  diverse  faculty  is  essential  to  a  pluralistic  campus. 
Faculty  create  the  curriculum  and  determine  the  qual- 
ity of  the  experience  in  every  classroom.  They  serve 
as  teachers,  mentors,  advisors,  and  role  models.  In  a 
word,  faculty  are  the  core  of  the  institution.  Without 
the  contributions  of  minority  individuals,  no  faculty 
or  institution  can  be  complete.  (American  Council  on 
Education) 

I  agree  with  a  growing  consensus  that  we  can  not  have  a 
college  of  the  highest  quality  without  diverse  student  bodies, 
faculty  and  staff.  I  believe  that  what  is  at  stake  is  the  Quality 
of  Plattsburgh  State. 

Our  diversity  theme  for  this  academic  year  proposed  by 
the  Diversity  Advisory  Committee,  is:  Excellence  Through 
Diversity:  Quality  Teaching  and  Quality  Learning. 

I  look  forward  to  this  academic  year  with  great  enthusi- 
asm and  expectations.

'70  Alumnus  Named  to  Develop  Career  Opportunities 

Edward  Smallman  to  Head  Career  Services  Center 

Edward  Smallman,  a  1970  Plattsburgh  State  graduate,  has 
been  appointed  director  of  the  Career  Services  Center,  formerly 
the  Career/Life  Planning  Center. 

Smallman  returns  to  his  alma  mater  from  the  Fletcher 
School  of  Law  and  Diplomacy  at  Tufts  University  in  Medford, 
Ma.,  where  he  was  director  of  the  Office  of  Career  Services  for 
the  past  two  years. 

As  director  of  the  Career  Services  Center,  Smallman  wants 
to  develop  strong  ties  with  businesses  and  recruit  organizations 
and  alumni  that  will  result  in  increased  professional  opportuni- 
ties for  Plattsburgh  graduates;  create  a  student  academic  center 
committed  to  intellectual  development;  and  improve  access  to  employment  opportunities 
for  students  and  alumni  through  networked  computers,  the  Internet  and  other  technological 
advances. 

Prior  to  his  position  at  Tufts  University,  Smallman  held  several  jobs  in  the  Career 
Services  and  Placement  Office,  Darden  Graduate  School  of  Business  Administration, 
University  of  Virginia,  Charlottesville,  Va.;  Personal  and  Career  Development  Center,

University  of  Michigan,  and  an  education  specialist  degree  and  doctorate  from  the 
University  of  Virginia.  He  is  a  member  of  several  professional  organizations  including  the 
American  College  Personnel  Association,  National  Association  of  Student  Personnel 
Administrators,  National  Career  Development  Association  and  American  Counseling 
Association.  He  is  a  national  certified  counselor  and  career  counselor. 


C-SPAN  Comes  to  Plattsburgh  State 


C-SPAN  came  to  Plattsburgh  last  week  as  the  cable  satellite  public  affairs  network 
retraces  the  steps  Alexis  de  Tocqueville  took  on  his  trip  through  America  in  the  early 
1800s.  President  Judson  greeted  the  C-SPAN  staff  as  the  bus  pulled  up  in  front  of 
his  home  on  Court  Street  Thursday  afternoon.  Shown  with  Judson  is:  Sam 
Scialabba,  New  York  regional  manager  for  Falcon  Cable;  Debbie  Lamb,  C-SPAN 
marketing  representative;  and,  Keith  Warehime,  C-SPAN  bus  production  special- 
ist Tocqueville  came  to  the  United  States  in  1831  from  France  to  study  the 
American  prison  system.  However,  he  was  more  interested  in  the  foundations  of 
American  democracy,  and  ultimately  wrote  the  milestone  book,  Democracy  in 
America.  During  a  nine-month  journey  that  began  in  May,  the  C-SPAN  bus  is 
visiting  the  55  cities  Tocqueville  traveled  in  his  1831  journey  across  the  nation. 


Higgins 


Freshman,  Transfer 
Deposits  Meet  Goal 

"We're  on  goal  as  of 
Sept.  2,"  said  Rich 
Higgins,  director  of  ad- 
missions. That  translates 
into  941  freshman  depos- 
its, which  actually  sur- 
passes the  enrollment 
goal  of  930.  There  are 
currently  630  transfer  de- 
posits, with  an  original  enrollment  goal  of 
625.  Readmit  students  came  in  at  139, 
exceeding  that  target  by  9. 

"This  has  been  a  difficult  and  challeng- 
ing recruitment  year,"  Higgins  said,  attribut- 
ing the  new  student  enrollment  success  to 
hard  work  put  forth  by  the  admissions  team 
and  the  support  of  the  faculty,  staff,  enrolled 
students  and  alumni. 

"Students  have  many  more  choices 
when  compared  to  a  few  years  ago,  so  it's 
vital  that  we  get  keep  putting  our  best  efforts 
out  to  attract  and  enroll  students." 

The  college  selection  process  contin- 
ued to  be  competitive  among  colleges  and 
universities  in  the  state,  and  a  variety  of  re- 
cruitment activities  were  employed  to  bring 
in  the  class.  Specialized  visitation  week- 
ends, personalized  letter  campaigns,  tele- 
phone calls  made  by  faculty  and  students, 
competitive  financial  aid  packages,  detailed 
credit  evaluations,  and  student-guided  cam- 
pus tours  all  contributed  to  the  good  enroll- 
ment yield. 

In  addition  to  the  traditional  financial 
aid  packages,  academic  merit  scholarships 
were  expanded  and  targeted  as  enrollment 
incentives  for  qualified  freshmen  and  trans- 
fers. 

More  than  $180,000  was  awarded  by 
the  Plattsburgh  College  Foundation  to  217 
entering  students  who  possessed  excellent 
academic  records.  Plattsburgh  offers  more 
scholarship  aid  than  most  of  its  SUNY  com- 
petitors, and  that  has  caught  the  notice  of 
students  and  parents. 

New  this  year  are  10  freshman  commu- 
nity service  scholars,  six  international  stu- 
dent scholars  and  five  empire  state  minority 
merit  scholars.  In  all,  106  freshmen  and  1 1 1 
transfers  are  merit  award  winners. 

"We've  worked  very  hard  to  bring  in 
this  class,"  said  Higgins,  "and  that  makes  it 
all  the  more  important  to  value  everyone  and 
to  help  new  students  persist  into  the  next 
year."

Resident  Assistants  Perform  1,000  Hours 
of  Community  Service  in  Clinton  County 


While  students  were  pre- 
paring to  return  to  Piattsburgh 
State  last  week,  resident  assis- 
tants from  12  dormitories  per- 
formed community  service 
projects  throughout  Clinton 
and  Essex  counties. 

RAs  from  Macomb  Hall, 
spread  cedar  mulch  around  a 
playground  at  St  John '  s  Acad- 
emy in  Plattsburg  while  oth- 
ers students  converged  on  vari- 
ous sites  to  paint,  constructed 
ramps,  landscaped,  and  per- 
formed trail  maintenance. 

From  the  Salvation  Army 
and  the  Essex  County  ARC  to 
the  Champlain  Valley 
Physicans  Hospital  and  Point 
Au  Roche  State  Park,  the  stu- 
dents performed  tasks  that 
would  not  have  been  completed 
for  some  time. 

A  group  of  RAs  from  Mason  Hall  put  up  posters  at  various  locations  throughout 
the  Piattsburgh  area  on  behalf  of  the  Child  Care  Coordinating  Council  alerting 
families  of  the  various  programs  the  council  offers.  Meg  Alberry,  coordinator  for 
Family  Connections  Resource  Center,  said  the  students  performing  a  very  valuable 
service. 

"With  a  staff  of  three  we  can't  get  out  to  many  of  the  locations  to  put  up  these 
posters.  We're  thrilled  to  have  their  help,  "  said  Alberry. 

Bill  Laundry,  dean  of  students,  said  the  RAs  performed  approximately  1,000 
hours  of  service  for  the  community  in  one  day. 


Second  Year  in  Row 

Alcohol  Awareness  Program  Wins  National  Award 


Piattsburgh  State  has  been  selected  for 
the  second  consecutive  year  one  of  the  top 
ten  award  winners  in  the  National  Collegiate 
Alcohol  Awareness  Week  programming 
competition. 

In  a  letter  to  Cori  Jackson-Matthews, 
coordinator  of  the  Wellness  Office,  Edward 
Hammond,  national  chair  of  NCAAW  and 
president  of  Fort  Hays  State  University, 
praised  Jackson  and  the  college  for  their 
efforts  in  curbing  alcohol  abuse  and  misuse 
on  the  college  campus. 

"It  is  gratifying  to  know  that  your  insti- 
tution appreciates  the  necessity  for  the  edu- 
cational community  to  get  involved  in  pro- 
moting healthy  lifestyles  among  young 
people  today,"  said  Hammond.  "Awareness 
through  education  is  one  of  the  most  effec- 
tive weapons  we  have  to  combat  alcohol 
misuse  and  abuse." 

Piattsburgh  State's  programming  has 


taken  on  a  holistic,  multi-dimensional  model 
of  personal  wellness.  This  approach  pro- 
motes positive  decision-making  and  respon- 
sible lifestyle  choices. 

Last  year  the  program  expanded  to  in- 
clude a  series  of  wellness  workshops  with 
two  offered  each  week  during  the  fall  and 
one  per  week  during  the  spring. 

"I  didn't  expect  we  would  win  again," 
said  Jackson-Matthews  who  was  excited 
and  surprised  to  hear  the  college  had  won 
two  years  in  a  row.  In  addition  to  Piattsburgh 
State,  the  winners  are:  University  of  Minne- 
sota at  Duluth;  College  of  William  and  Mary; 
Regis  University;  Purdue  University;  Vir- 
ginia Commonwealth;  University  of  Mis- 
souri at  Columbia;  George  Mason  Univer- 
sity; Central  Michigan;  and  SUNY  Oswego. 

Jackson-Matthews  will  receive  the 
award  at  the  National  Peer  Education  con- 
ference in  St.  Louis,  Missouri,  in  November.

Worthington 


Worthington  Named 
Lifelong  Learning 
Center  Director 


Janet  Evans 
Worthington,  of 
Thibodaux,  La., 
has  been  ap- 
pointed director 
of  the  Center  for 
Lifelong  Learning 
at  Piattsburgh 
State. 

Worthington 
was  formerly  the 
director  of  the  Di- 
vision of  Continuing  Education  at  Nichols 
State  University  in  Thibodaux.  While  at 
Nichols,  she  was  responsible  for  the  sched- 
uling of  credit  courses  at  off-campus  sites; 
initiating  and  implementing  credit  and  non- 
credit  programs  for  business,  industry  and 
the  community;  and  directing  the  distance 
learning  programs. 

At  Piattsburgh  State,  Worthington  has 
set  several  goals  for  the  center.  They  are: 

Enhance  summer  school  offerings:  Es- 
tablish the  course  schedule  earlier  after  sur- 
veying students  for  courses  that  would  be  of 
most  interested  to  them,  and  provide  more 
opportunities  for  students  and  unique  pro- 
grams for  special  groups. 

Develop  programs  for  businesses.  Es- 
tablish links  with  businesses  in  the  commu- 
nity to  determine  what  educational  training 
employees  need  and  expand  off-campus  of- 
ferings. 

Enlarge  the  adult  education  program. 
Raise  awareness  of  services  Piattsburgh  State 
can  provide  adult  learners  in  Northern  New 
York. 

Expand  distance  learning.  The  center 
will  assume  control  of  the  distance  learning 
system  established  with  five  sites  in  North- 
ern New  York  within  the  next  year.  New 
courses  and  programs  will  be  established  to 
meet  the  needs  of  distance  learners. 

Establish  a  winter  intercession.  The 
college  will  develop  an  intercession  between 
the  fall  and  spring  semesters  offering  several 
creative  courses  and  programs  for  students. 

Worthington  has  held  several  positions 
at  West  Virginia  Institute  of  Technology 
where  she  was  previously  coordinator  of 
Continuing  Education  and  director  of  the 
Honors  Program. 

She  holds  a  bachelor's  degree  from  the 
University  of  Chicago,  a  master's  degree 
from  the  University  of  Iowa  and  a  doctorate 
from  Florida  State  University. 


Professor  to  Examine  Meteorite  for  Life  on  Mars 


Do  you  have  a  piece  of  the  "rock?"  Dr. 
George  Flynn  does  and  he  will  be  conduct- 
ing tests  on  it  soon  to  determine  whether 
there  was  once  life  on  Mars. 

The  rock  in  question  is  ALH 84001 ,  the 
meteorite  scientists  at  the  NASA  Johnson 
Space  Center  in  Houston  say  contains  evi- 
dence of  possible  ancient  life  on  Mars.  Sci- 
entists believe  the  meteorite  rocketed  from 
the  Martian  planet  1 6  million  years  ago  after 
a  large  asteroid  blasted  a  chuck  of  the  red 
planet  into  space. 

It  encountered  Earth's  atmosphere 
1 3,000  years  ago  and  fell  in  Antarctica  as  a 
meteorite.  It  remained  there  until  1984  when 
it  was  found  by  a  scientific  expedition  of  the 
National  Science  Foundation' s  Antarctic  Me- 
teorite Program  exploring  the  Allan  Hills  Ice 
Field  in  Antarctica. 

Flynn,  a  professor  of  physics,  received 
about  five  grams  of  the  ALH 84001  Mars 
meteorite  from  NASA.  "This  is  part  of  the 
first  allocation  of  this  meteorite  for  scientific 
study  since  reported  in  August  1996  of  evi- 
dence of  possible  ancient  life  in  this  meteor- 
ite," said  Flynn. 

Dr  David  McKay  of  the  Johnson  Space 
Center  and  co-workers  reported  last  year 
that  the  meteorite  contained  some  forma- 
tions within  the  Martian  rock  suggesting  that 
there  was  ancient  biological  activity  on  Mars. 
One  pieces  of  evidence  was  a  high  concen- 
tration of  what  are  called  polycyclic  aro- 
matic hydrocarbons.  Flynn  said  these 
hydrocarbons,  found  in  small  nodules  of 
carbonate  in  the  meteorite,  are  frequently 
found  as  a  decay  product  of  living  material. 


Flynn  and  several  other  fel- 
low  scientists  have  already 
found  some  interesting  results 
from  smaller  samples  of  the 
meteorite.  "We  have  shown  a 
close  association  between  two 
different  carbon  compounds 
and  the  material  McKay  and 
coworkers  had  called  attention 
to,"  said  Flynn.  "With  the  new, 
much  larger  sample,  we  will  be 
able  to  continue  this  work." 

The  ALH84001  sample 
was  shipped  from  the  Johnson 
Space  Center  wrapped  in  alu- 
minum to  avoid  contact  with 
any  carbon  compounds  which 
was  then  placed  in  a  sealed  plas- 
tic bag.  "To  avoid  contamina- 
tion, I  can't  remove  it  except  in 
a  "clean  room,"  which  we  have 
down  at  the  Brookhaven  Na- 
tional Laboratory  on  Long 
Island,"  said  Flynn. 

Flynn' s  project,  to  study 
the  distribution  and  types  of 
carbon  compounds  in  the 
ALH84001  meteorite,  is  being  funded  by 
NASA.  This  is  one  of  more  than  a  dozen 
investigations  of  the  meteorite  selected  by 
the  space  organization  for  funding. 

"I  plan  to  use  three  state-of-the-art  in- 
struments at  Brookhaven  to  map  the  distri- 
bution of  carbon  compounds  in  this  rock. 
One  of  the  instruments  will  provide  images 
with  a  spatial  resolution  1000  times  better 
than  that  used  in  the  McKay  experiment," 


Dr.  George  Flynn  holds  the  sample  of  the  Martian  meteorite 
he  will  conduct  tests  on  to  determine  if  life  existed  millions 
of  years  ago  on  Mars. 

said  Flynn. 

"As  a  result  of  this  enhanced  resolution, 
we  will  be  able  to  determine  just  how  closely 
the  carbon  compounds  are  associated  with 
the  other  unusual  features  McKay  and  his 
colleagues  reported.  The  instruments  at 
Brookhaven  will  also  let  us  look  at  a  wider 
variety  of  carbon  compounds  than  McKay's 
group  was  able  to  examine." 


UUP,  State  Settle  Four- Year  Contract  Including  Benefits,  Raises 


If  a  tentative  four-year  contract  settle- 
ment between  New  York  State  and  United 
University  Professions  is  approved,  ap- 
proximately 400  faculty  and  professionals 
at  Plattsburgh  State  will  see  across-the- 
board  salary  increases,  a  cash  lump  sum 
payment  of  $  1 ,250  per  employee,  and  res- 
toration of  the  UUP  Benefit  Trust  Fund 
covering  dental  and  vision  benefits. 

The  21,000  UUP  members  at  29 
SUNY  campuses  are  currently  balloting 
on  the  agreement,  which  was  tentatively 
agreed  upon  during  negotiations  in  July. 
Terms  of  the  agreement  that  would  be 
retroactive  to  July  2,  1995,  and  includes: 
across-the-board  salary  increases  of  three- 


point-five  percent  effective  Jan  1 .  of  1 998 
and  1999;  an  immediate  one-time  lump 
sum  cash  payment  of  $1,250  to  all  full- 
time  employees  and  prorated  for  all-part- 
time  employees;  an  immediate  payment 
of  $500  on  the  base,  retroactive  to  July 
1996  for  all  full-time  employees  and  pro- 
rated for  all  part-time  employees  with 


term  appointments;  full  restoration  omen- 
tal and  vision  benefits  and  retroactive  re- 
imbursements for  all  dental  and  vision 
claims  dating  from  May  9,  1996.  The 
tentative  settlement  which  would  be  effec- 
tive through  July  1 ,  1 999,  would  also  pro- 
vide some  discretionary  monies  and  in- 
crease job  security. 


Union  President  to  Visit  Campus  Sept.  Ninth 

UUP  President  William  Scheuerman  will  visit  the  campus  Tuesday,  Sept.  9th 
to  discuss  the  proposed  four-year  contract  settlement  and  answer  any  questions 
local  UUP  members  have  about  terms  of  the  agreement.  All  employees  are  invited 
to  attend  the  discussion  that  will  be  held  at  4:30  p.m.  in  the  Warren  Ballrooms, 
Angell  College  Center.

Faculty/Staff  Donate  $144,026  to  Campaign 


Plattsburgh  State  faculty  and  staff  donated 
$144,026  to  the  Plattsburgh  College  Foundation  dur- 
ing the  1996-97  fiscal  year,  which  ended  on  June  30. 

More  than  395  faculty/staff  participated  in  the 
program,  for  an  average  gift  of  $175.  The  overall 
figures  include  a  bequest  of  $75,000  from  the  estate  of 
the  late  Craig  A.  Koste  '69,  library  clerk. 

While  some  gifts  were  designated  for  particular 
purposes,  most  of  the  money  donated  by  faculty/staff 


will  be  used  for  student  aid.  The  foundation  will  be 
able  to  provide  nearly  700  students  with  a  total  of 
almost  half  a  million  dollars  in  aid  for  the  upcoming 
year. 

"For  many  of  those  students,  it  means  the  differ- 
ence between  continuing  their  education  here  at  Platts- 
burgh State  or  not.  Unfortunately,  we  still  aren't  able 
to  help  every  student  who  qualifies,"  noted  Don  Garrant, 
executive  director  of  the  Foundation.

Men's  Soccer  Team  Readies  for  Pepsi  Classic  Sept.  6-7 


After  three  trips  to  the  NCAA  tourna- 
ment, two  Eastern  Collegiate  Athletic  Con- 
ference Tournament  appearances  including 
an  EC  AC  Championship  in  1996,  and  two 
State  University  of  New  York  Athletic  Con- 
ference titles  in  the  past  five  years,  the  e 
men's  soccer  team  has  placed  itself  among 
the  nation's  soccer  elite.  In  1997,  the  Cardi- 
nals return  a  strong  team  ready  to  continue 
the  Cardinal  soccer  winning  tradition. 

The  1 997  Cardinals  open  their  schedule 
at  home  in  the  Pepsi  Cardinal  Classic  Satur- 
day, Sept.  6.  Pittsburgh  faces  Southern 
Maine  at  12:00  p.m.  and  Staten  Island  plays 
St.  John  Fisher  at  4:00  p.m.  The  Pepsi 
Cardinal  Classic  continues  on  Sunday,  Sept. 
7,  with  the  consolation  at  1:00  p.m.  and  the 
championship  game  set  for  3:00  p.m. 

It  was  a  record  breaking  season  in  1996 
as  the  Cardinals  scored  a  school  record  of  80 
goals  in  20  games.  Despite  losing  their  top 
two  scorers  to  graduation,  the  Cardinals  look 
to  be  potent  once  again  in  the  offensive  third. 

Junior  Chris  Gondek  of  Chazy,  has  al- 
ready moved  into  eighth  place  on  the  all- 
time  Cardinal  scoring  list  with  53  points  in 
his  first  two  seasons.  The  1996  ECAC 
Tournament  MVP,  junior  tri-captain  Dan 
Corbett  of  Oswego  came  on  strong  at  midfield 
last  season,  finishing  with  12  points.  Junior 
Dan  Ciolek  from  Ithaca,  a  division  I  transfer 


from  the  Univer- 
sity of  Buffalo  and 
Mid-Continent 
Conference 
Rookie  of  the  Year  in  1995,  is  expected  to 
make  an  immediate  impact. 

Juniors  Phil  Lombardo  of  Holtsville, 
Kevin  Riddleberger  of  Endicott,  and  Mike 
Paolini  of  Liverpool  return  at  midfield  for 
the  Cardinals.  Lombardo  finished  third  in 
scoring  last  season  with  20  points  and  Paolini 
proved  to  be  a  goal  scoring  threat  with  seven 
goals  after  his  move  from 
the  backfield  to  midfield. 
Riddleberger' s  fiesty 
playmaking  ability  will 
once  again  be  counted 
on  offensively  and  de- 
fensively. Freshman 
Eddie  Eck  from  Sachem, 
Sachem  High  School's 
MVP  in  1996,  has  shown 
good  speed  and  strength 
in  pre-season  and  should 
make  an  impact  in  his 
first  season  as  a  Cardi- 
nal. 

Despite  the  gradua- 
tion of  All-Region  and 
All-SUNYAC  back  Shea 
Greene,  the  Cardinals 


return  a  veteran  defense.  Junior  David  Corker 
from  Commack  will  provide  solid  marking 
in  the  back.  He  displayed  good  playmaking 
ability  last  season  with  six  assists.  Senior  tri- 
captain  Pat  McMahon  from  Scottsville  re- 
ceived All-SUNYAC  honors  last  season  for 
his  play  at  sweeper. 

Junior  Andy  Cumbo  from  Fairport  has 
started  every  game  but  one  since  his  arrival 
in  1995,  registering  14  career  shutouts. 
Freshman  Mike  Kuznia  of  Brewerton,  will 
compete  for  time  in  the  goal. 


The  Men's  Soccer  Team  will  open  their  season  Saturday,  Sept.  6 
against  Southern  Maine  in  the  Pepsi  Cardinal  Classic. 


Women's  Soccer  Team  Opens  Against  Hartwick  College  This  Weekend 


PREVIEW 


After  seven 
straight  winning 
seasons  and  seven 
consecutive  post- 
season appearances  including  the  1996 
NYSWCAA  title,  the  Cardinals  enter  the 
1997  season  with  the  confidence  and  expe- 
rience, to  continue  this  winning  tradition. 

The  1997  Cardinals  open  their  schedule 
at  home  against  Hartwick  on  Saturday,  Sept. 
6,  at  2:00  p.m.  The  following  weekend,  the 
Lady  Cardinals  will  hosts  the  Pepsi  Cardinal 
Classic  with  Plattsburgh  facing  Elmira  at 
1 2:00  p.m.  and  Keene  (NH)  playing  Johnson 
(VT)  at 4:00 p.m.  on  Saturday,  Sept.  13.  The 
Pepsi  Cardinal  Classic  continues  on  Sun- 
day, Sept.  14,  with  Johnson  facing  Elmira  at 
1 :00  p.m.  and  Plattsburgh  playing  Keene  at 
3:00  p.m. 

With  the  game  tying  goal  that  sent  the 
game  into  overtime  in  last  season's  state 
championship  win  over  Nazareth,  junior 
Jamie  Retersdorf  of  Gloversville  returns  as 


one  of  the  Cardinal  top  scoring  threats. 
Retersdorf  was  the  top  goal  scorer  last  sea- 
son with  eight  goals.  Junior  Karen  Perrotta 
from  Carmel  returns  after  missing  last  sea- 
son with  an  injury.  Junior  transfer  Jill 
Hubrightfrom  Williamsville  is  alsoexpected 
to  contribute  at  forward. 

The  Cardinals  will  be  particularly  deep 
at  midfield  this  season.  Senior  captain  Car- 
rie Rose  of  Waddington  is  Plattsburgh' s 
second  top  returning  scorer.  Last  season, 
Rose  tallied  four  goals  including  two  game 
winners  and  four  assists  and  was  selected  to 
the  1 996  Pepsi  Cardinal  Classic  All-Tourna- 
ment team.  Junior  Jennifer  Jury  from 
Chittenango  was  Plattsburgh' s  other  hero  in 
the  state  final,  scoring  the  game  winning 
goal  in  the  first  overtime  to  defeat  Nazareth 
2- 1 .  Freshmen  Cathy  Cappetta,  Spencerport 
High  School's  1996-97  Academic  Athlete 
of  the  Year,  and  Shanna  Saunders,  an  All- 
Greater  Rochester  player,  should  impact 
immediately.  Keri  Honors  of  Kirkvillc  and 

[12] 


an  All- American  junior  transfer  from  Keuka 
College  tops  the  list  of  newcomers  for  the 
Cardinals 

Junior  captain  Jessica  Allen  of  Buffalo 
once  again  returns  in  top  form  after  starting 
all  41  games  since  her  arrival  in  Plattsburgh 
in  1995.  A 1 996  GTE  Academic  AJ1-  Ameri- 
can, All-State,  and  All-SUNYAC  player, 
Allen  will  anchor  the  Cardinal  defense  at  the 
sweeper  position.  Junior  Erika  Wood  of 
Rochester  is  in  top  form  and  will  add  good 
ball  skills  and  a  long  throw-in.  while  juniors 
Renee  Lucier  of  Troy  and  Maura  Clavering 
from  Dix  Hills  have  proven  to  be  consistent 
yet  tenacious  defenders. 

The  Cardinals  will  be  strong  in  net  with 
senior  Amy  Flick  from  Cadyville  and  junior 
Erin  Shaw  of  Rochester  competing  for  the 
number  one  spot.  Shaw  appeared  in 
Plattsburgh' s  NCAA  Tournament  game 
against  Williams  College  in  1995.  That 
season,  Flick  and  Shaw  combined  for  a  total 
of  13  shoutouts  last  season,  a  school  record.

Sept.  16  Art  Symposium  in  Connection  with  Exhibit 


Jerome  Witkin,  "Unseen  and  Unheard,"  (In  Memory  of  all  Victims  of 
Torture),  oil  on  linen,  63"  x  75 


In  conjunction  with  the  "Psychologically  Charged,'"  exhibition  which  is  currently 
on  display  in  the  Burke  and  the  Rockwell  Kent  Galleries  at  Plattsburgh  State,  the 
Visual  Artist  Series  will  host  a  forum  on  contemporary  figurative  art.  Tuesday.  Sept. 
16 

'  Issues  in  Contemporary  Figurative  Art  Symposium  will  feature  four  interna- 
tionally known  figurative  artists:  Sigmund  Abeles,  Gregory  Gillespie,  Paul  Matthews 
and  Jerome  Witkin.  Work  by  all  four  artists  is  part  of  the  show  that  is  on  exhibit 
until  Oct.  19 

These  four  artists  represent  an  aspect  of  figuration  which  artist  Frank  Owen  has 
called  psychologically-charged  n  They  have  been  described  as  among  the  major 
realists  in  late  20th  century  art  even  though  the  artists  have  characterized  them- 
selves as  artists  who  use  figurative  imagery  for  narrative  and  associated  ends. 

Students  and  faculty  will  have  the  opportunity  to  speak  with  the  artists  in  the 
Burke  Gallery  at  a  2:30  p.m.  informal  discussion  of  works  in  the  exhibition.  There  will 
be  a  public  reception  for  symposium  participants  at  5  p.m.  in  the  Burke  Gallery 
Lounge  and  a  public  symposium  in  the  Plattsburgh  Room  of  Angell  College  Center 
at  7:30  p.m.  A  slide  presentation  on  the  artists'  work  will  be  followed  by  a  discussion

To  Bring  Virtual  Reality  to  Nursing  Education  Late  This  Year 

HT  Medical  and  Plattsburgh  State  Sign  Agreement 


Following  a  two-year,  multi-million  dollar  collaborative  re- 
search and  development  effort,  Plattsburgh  State  and  HT  Medical, 
Inc.,  a  world  leader  in  virtual  reality  medical  simulation,  have  signed 
an  agreement  to  bring  to  market  the  virtual  reality  intravenous 
infusion  simulator. 

This  simulator,  which  will  be  marketed  as  CathSimâ„¢,  will  train 
healthcare  providers  in  the  cognitive  and  motor  skills  associated 
with  performing  vascular  catheterization  prior  to  actual  patient 
contact. 

Virginia  Barker,  dean  of  the  faculty  of  Professional  Studies,  said, 
"The  present  methods  of  teaching  these  [venipuncture]  procedures 
are  inadequate.  The  faculty  looked  at  virtual  reality  and  thought  this 
was  the  way  that  we  could  help  students  to  develop  a  skill,  increase 
their  self-confidence,  and  have  consistency  of  presentation  at  all 
times... before  they  actually  go  to  a  patient  and  perform  the  proce- 
dure." 

The  prototype,  which  is  housed  in  the  Damianos  Nursing  Skills 
Laboratory  in  Hawkins  Hall  and  used  by  nursing  students,  was 
developed  with  supercomputer  hardware  and  sophisticated  software 
technology. 

Recent  advances  in  both  hardware  and  software  technology  now 
allow  CathSim  to  run  on  a  personal  computer,  which  makes  it  both 
affordable  and  accessible  to  a  variety  of  nursing  schools  and  training 


Students  at  universities  and  colleges  nationwide  will  soon  have  the  opportunity 
to  learn  how  to  perform  a  proper  venipuncture  when  CathSim  goes  to  market 
by  the  end  of  the  year.  Assistant  Professor  of  Nursing  David  Curry  watches  the 
monitor  as  Caroline  Allen  and  Gisele  Faubert  learn  to  maneveur  the  virtual

facilities.  The  simulator  includes  a  force  feedback  input  device  that 
simulates  the  actual  feel  of  the  needle-stick  procedure.  Using  this 
"Virtual  Cannula"  input  device,  the  trainee  is  able  to  sense  the  tactile

Plattsburgh  College  Foundation  Campaign  Raises  More  Than  $1  Million 


The  Foundation '  s  1 996-97  campaign  was 
the  third  most  successful  in  its  history  with 
$1,055,148  raised.  The  number  of  donors â€” 
7,237 â€”  was  the  Foundation's  best  year  in 
terms  of  individuals,  businesses  and  organi- 
zations who  contributed  to  the  various 
annual  giving  programs,  through  planned 
gifts,  and  to  the  endowment  fund. 

The  $1  million-plus  received  repre- 
sents a  16.5  percent  increase  ($148,250) 
over  last  year' s  appeal.  The  1 6.5  percent 
increase  exceeded  contributions  to  higher 
education  nationally,  which  were  up  12 
percent. 

Fifty-nine  percent  of  the  total  income 
($626,744)  was  raised  through  the  an- 
nual giving  campaign,  while  thirty  per- 


cent of  the  total  dollars  ($320,439)  came 
from  planned  gifts.  Giving  to  the  various 
annual  giving  campaigns  increased  by  32 
percent  over  fiscal  year  1995-96.

Dean  Lavoie:  Support  of  Teaching,  Faculty  Development  Tops  Priorities 


Kathleen  Lavoie  says  she  feels  like  a 
transfer  student  since  assuming  the  position 
of  dean  of  arts  and  science  in  August. 

"I've  got  a  pretty  good  idea  of  what's 
going  on  without  learning  the  details,"  said 
Lavoie. 

In  general  she's  happy  with  the  move 
even  though  SUNY  has  come  under  attack 
the  past  couple  of  years.  "SUNY  still  has  a 
very  good  reputation,"  said  Lavoie.  "I  thought 
I  was  coming  here  at  a  good  time  because 
things  appeared  to  be  turning  around.  They '  ve 
actually  turned  out  better  than  I  had  hoped 
for." 

Students  are  getting  a  good  educational 
experience  and  she  has  taken  the  attitude  that 
"If  it  isn't  broke,  don't  fix  it,"  at  least  for  the 
next  six  months  to  a  year  as  she  becomes 
more  familiar  with  the  campus,  faculty  and 
students. 

But,  there  are  some  real  concerns  Lavoie 
said  she  wants  to  immediately  address,  if 
possible. 


response  of  needle  placement,  from  the  "pop" 
device  as  the  needle  enters  the  skin,  through 
entry  into  the  vein  lumen. 

"The  benefit  of  using  CathSim  in  com- 
parison to  the  models  that  were  used  in  the 
past  is  the  feeling  that  the  students  get  of 
actually  inserting  a  needle  into  the  skin  and 
the  vein,"  said  Gretchen  Beebe,  chairperson 
and  professor  of  nursing.  'The  software  and 
the  case  studies  that  are  presented  in  combi- 
nation with  the  simulation  provide  for  an 


She  wants  to  see  more  support  of  teaching 
and  faculty  development.  She  also  believes 
in  increased  attention  to  adjunct  faculty. 

"While  there  have  been  changes  in  evalu- 
ations of  adjunct  faculty,  I  am  also  interested 
in  rewards  and  recognition  for  our  adjuncts. 
We  should  also  make  sure  that  they  can 
develop  their  skills  and  get  recognized  for 
what  they  do." 

Lavoie  said  that  while  the  college  is  com- 
mitted to  raising  the  pay  of  part-time  faculty, 
she  is  also  looking  into  other  non-monetary 
efforts,  including  a  teaching  award  for  ad- 
junct faculty  and  better  communication  of 
information. 

The  faculty,  Lavoie  said,  "are  a  fine  group 
who  are  committed  to  their  teaching." 

The  dean  said  she's  innovative  in  her 
thinking  and  encourages  the  use  of  new 
learning  techniques.  At  the  same  time  she  is 
also  cautious  about  the  use  of  the  World 
Wide  Web  and  protecting  academic  prop- 
erty. 


integrated,  realistic  learning  experience." 

Gregory  Merrill,  president  and  chief  ex- 
ecutive of  HT  Medical,  announced  that 
CathSim  would  be  available  by  year  end. 

During  the  (spring)  semester,  the  Depart- 
ment of  Nursing  at  the  college  demonstrated 
the  success  of  the  prototype,  allowing  us  to 
be  confident  about  the  efficacy  of  the  prod- 
uct," said  Merrill.  "HT  Medical  is  pleased  to 
be  working  with  Plattsburgh  State  Univer- 
sity to  make  VR  training  a  reality."

"It  is  a  tremendous  opportunity  but  you 
need  to  understand  it  a  lot  better,"  said  Lavoie. 

Some  courses  may  be  taught  on  the  Web 
or  through  distance  learning  systems,  but 
Lavoie  stated,  "You  have  to  be  really,  really 
careful  to  protect  people's  academic  prop- 
erty. You  have  to  be  careful  you  don't  inad- 
vertently put  something  out  for  public  con- 
sumption that  really  shouldn't  be  released. 

"If  we  are  all  aware  of  the  risks  then  we 
can  go  into  it  with  our  eyes  open.  I  don't  like 
not  trying  something  because  it  might  be 
risky.  I'd  rather  try  it  and  work  out  the 
consequences." 

She  also  cautions  students  to  be  aware  of 
the  dangers  of  utilizing  the  information  ac- 
cessible on  the  web.  "Student  have  to  under- 
stand that  not  everything  is  on  the  Internet. 
There  are  other  sources  of  information." 

Even  as  dean  Lavoie  said  she  has  a  desire 
to  be  in  the  classroom  and  is  looking  forward 
to  teaching  a  lab  next  semester  at  Plattsburgh 
State. 

"Without  teaching,  I  loss  the  academic 
rhythm  of  the  year.  That's  very  important  to 
me  because  I  don't  know  when  faculty  are 
going  to  be  most  stressed.  This  semester  is 
the  first  time  in  years  I  haven't  taught,"  said 
Lavoie.  "I  miss  that  little  extra  surge  of 
adrenaline  you  get  at  the  beginning  of  the 
semester."  She  hopes  to  develop  a  course  or 
two  with  the  biology  department  for  next 
fall. 

Lavoie  says  she's  got  a  lot  of  reading  to 
do.  And  there's  the  inevitable  unpacking 
that  needs  to  be  done. 

Since  arriving  late  this  summer,  Lavoie, 
her  husband,  Jim,  who  is  a  nurse,  and  their 
three  children,  have  been  sorting  through  the 
boxes  that  have  filled  their  house  on 
Cumberland  Head. 

The  dean  has  even  managed  to  sneak  in  a 
trip  to  Mexico  in  December  without  the 
family.  It's  not  for  the  sun,  but  to  explore  a 
cave. 

A  few  years  ago,  Lavoie  said,  researchers 
found  a  cave  in  Romania  with  a  low  tem- 
perature, high  sulfur  ecosystem  completely 
isolated  from  the  surface.  It  has  unique 
forms  of  life  not  seen  anywhere  in  the  world. 

"Now,  there's  been  a  cave  discovered  in 
Mexico  that  might  be  another  one  of  these. 
I've  been  invited  along  on  the  expedition  to 
try  to  determine  if  it  is  another  one  of  these 
systems,"  said  Lavoie. 

"That's  the  sort  of  thing  a  biologist  thinks 
is  fun."

Eastern  Adirondack  Health  Network 
Awarded  $163,000  NYS  Grant 


The  Eastern  Adirondack  Health  Care 
Network,  a  coalition  of  27  health  care  pro- 
viders in  Clinton,  Essex  and  Franklin  coun- 
ties, has  been  awarded  a  grant  of  $163,853 
from  the  New  York  State  Department  of 
Health's  Rural  Health  Network  Develop- 
ment Program. 

EAHCN  is  housed  at  the  Northeastern 
New  York  Alzheimer's  Disease  Assistance 
Center  at  Plattsburgh  State  and  is  chaired  by 
Dr.  Taher  Zandi,  distinguished  service  pro- 
fessor and  director  of  AD  AC. 


The  grant  will  be  used  to  assist  the  rural 
health  system  to  provide  high  quality  care 
within  the  rapidly  changing  health  care  in- 
dustry for  the  people  of  the  region. 

The  association  will  use  the  funds  to  en- 
large community  involvement  in  reducing 
risk  factors  for  the  health  and  care  of  the 
poor;  implement  cardiovascular  disease  pre- 
vention/education in  the  region;  expand  ac-

Dr.  James  Loewen:  Author,  Scholar,  Activist 
To  Speak  at  Plattsburgh  State  Sept.  18 

Dr.  James  Loewen,  author  of  Lies  My  Teacher  Told  Me: 
Everything  Your  High  School  History  Textbook  Got  Wrong, 
will  speak  Thursday,  Sept.  18,  at  8  p.m.  in  the  Warren 
Ballrooms  of  the  Angell  College  Center. 

Loewen,  a  professor  at  The  Catholic  University  of 
America  in  Washington  D.C,  is  a  distinguished  teacher, 
scholar,  and  civil  rights  activist  who  has  long  been  consid- 
ered a  champion  of  teaching  American  history  that  includes 
the  contributions  of  women,  minorities,  Natives  and  work- 
ing people. 

He  spent  two  years  at  the  Smithsonian  Institution  sur- 
LoeWen  vey  ing  leading  high  school  textbooks  of  American  history. 

Loewen  said  he  found  an  embarrassing  blend  of  bland  op- 
timism, blind  nationalism  and  plain  misinformation  in  his  reading. 

In  response,  he  wrote  Lies  My  Teacher  Told  Me  which  won  the  American  Book 
Award  of  the  Before  Columbus  Foundation  and  the  Oliver  C.  Cox  Anti-Racism  Award 
of  the  American  Sociological  Association's  Section  on  Race  and  Ethnic  Minorities  in 
1996. 

His  appearance  at  Plattsburgh  State  is  made  possible  through  the  President' s  Speaker 
Series,  which  is  sponsored  by  the  offices  of  the  presidents  of  Plattsburgh  State  and  the 
Student  Association,  and  the  College  Auxiliary  Services. 


Donors  Contribute  (Continued  from  Page  1) 


burgh  State,"  noted  Don  Garrant,  the 
Foundation's  executive  director. 

Ambitious  goals  were  set  for  "The  Platts- 
burgh Fund"  (the  annual  alumni  giving  cam- 
paign) of  raising  $220,000,  from  5,250  total 
donors  and  700  new  donors.  All  of  those 
goals  were  exceeded  by  raising  more  than 
$244,991  from  about  5,300  donors,  which 
included  well  over  1,800  new  donors. 

A  low-key  campaign  to  increase  partici- 
pation and  contributions  from  the  50  year 
class  resulted  in  26  gifts  (70%  of  the  class 
members).  This  year,  the  development  staff 
is  working  with  six  classes  from  the  40th 
anniversary  class  to  the  65-year  class.  Each 
member  of  these  six  classes  is  being  asked  to 
make  a  special  gift  in  honor  of  their  particu- 


lar reunion  class  or  to  increase  their  annual 
gift. 

The  Foundation's  strong  fund  raising  ef- 
forts have  helped  Plattsburgh  State  make  an 
education  more  affordable  for  many  stu- 
dents. 

During  the  1996-97  fiscal  year,  College 
Foundation  scholarships,  totaling  $45 1 , 105, 
were  awarded  to  788  students.  This  was 
more  than  $68,000  higher  than  the  previous 
year,  or  an  18  percent  increase. 

"I  am  sure  that  many  people  realize  that 
we  try  to  make  a  quality  education  afford- 
able to  anyone  who  needs  or  wants  one.  As 
a  result,  our  various  fund  raising  campaigns 
are  extremely  important,"  Garrant  added.

sity of  New  York  from 
1938  until  her  retirement 
in  1960,  died  Aug.  28, 
1997  in  Franconia,  N.H.,  at  the  age  of  93. 

Ms.  Norton  was  born  on  Jan.  4,  1904  in 
Boston,  Mass.  She  was  raised  in  Boston  until 
she  went  to  college  at  the  University  of  New 
Hampshire.  She  worked  at  Keene  State  Col- 
lege, Loyola  School  in  Cleveland,  Ohio,  and 
for  the  Home  Economics  Education  Bureau 
within  the  State  of  New  Hampshire  Depart- 
ment of  Education  prior  to  coming  to  Platts- 
burgh.

tion division,  Ms.  Norton  was  responsible 
for  overseeing  the  development  of  the  cur- 
riculum for  Plattsburgh  State's  first  four- 
year  program  yielding  a  bachelor  of  science 
degree.  The  first  alumni  of  the  home  eco- 
nomics education  division  with  four-year 
degrees  graduated  in  June  1941. 

Ms.  Norton  retired  to  Essex,  Ct.,  in  1960 
where  she  lived  for  many  years  until  she 
moved  to  Franconia,  NH  to  live  near  her 
brother,  William. 

In  addition  to  her  duties  supervising  the 
Home  Economic  division  at  Plattsburgh 
State,  Ms.  Norton  arranged  for  the  purchase 
of  many  pieces  of  furniture  of  outstanding 
quality,  as  well  as  dinnerware,  crystal  and 
silverware. 

Prior  to  her  death,  the  Plattsburgh  College 
Foundation  began  a  project  to  restore  the 
collection  and  find  a  suitable  location  for 
display .  This  collection,  which  will  be  called 
the  Louise  Norton  Classic  Collection  Exhi- 
bition, will  be  made  a  permanent  part  of  the 
college's  Art  Museum  and  will  be  housed  in 
the  Fireplace  Lounge  in  Ward  Hall  in  the 
near  future. 

She  is  survived  by  her  brother,  William, 
two  nieces,  one  nephew  and  several  grand- 
nieces.  There  were  no  services  for  Ms. 
Norton  although  a  memorial  service  may  be 
held  at  a  later  date. 

Contributions  in  memory  of  Ms.  Norton 
can  be  made  to  the  Louise  Norton  Classic 
Collection  Exhibition,  c/o  Plattsburgh  Col-

Joe  Clark,  Lean  On  Me  Principal  to  Speak  During   Family  Weekend 


Joe  Clark,  the  former  principal  of 
Eastside  High  School  in  Paterson, 
NJ,  who  turned  the  public  school 
fraught  with  drugs,  violence  and 
vandalism  into  a  model  educational 
institution,  will  be  the  guest  speaker

Nursing  Cadets  Return  to  Plattsburgh 


Several  of  the  Nursing  Cadets  from  the  graduating  class  of  1947  review  a  copy  of  the  "C  ardinal 
Yearbook*'  from  that  year  during  the  open  house  honoring  their  Golden  Anniversary. 

The  Class  of  1947  Nurse  Cadet  Corps  returned  to  Plattsburgh  State  Saturday, 
Sept.  13  to  celebrate  their  Golden  Anniversary. 

During  an  open  house  in  their  honor,  the  nursing  graduates  enjoyed  "walking  down 
memory  lane."  They  also  were  giving  a  demonstration  of  CathSim,  the  virtual  reality 
IV  simulator  in  the  Damianos  Nursing  Skills  Lab,  and  an  overview  of  the  today's 
nursing  program  at  Plattsburgh  State. 

Several  Student  Ambassadors  escorted  the  nursing  alumni  on  a  tour  of  Hawkins 
Hall,  which  was  the  only  building  on  campus  when  they  were  students.

Students,  Faculty  Show  Interest 

Faculty  Mentoring  Program  Moves  Ahead 


A  new  faculty 
mentoring  program  for 
minority  students  is  on 
the  horizon  and  there  is  a 
growing  interest  from 
students  and  faculty.  In 
fact,  more  than  50  stu- 
dents and  25  faculty  have 
expressed  interest  in  the 
program. 

Gail  Judson,  SUNY 
associate  to  the  president, 
said  the  purpose  of  a  fac- 
ulty mentoring  program 
at  Plattsburgh  State  is  Parity  and  administrators  gathered  at  Vale  our  Conference  Center  this 
two- fold*  for  the  Students  summer  to  nsten  to  a  consultant  speak  about  goals  for  a  faculty  mentoring 

â€¢iiu    u     ir     *         program  at  Plattsburgh  State, 
it  will  build  self-esteem  v 

and  improve  grades  and  the  college  will  boost  retention  of  minority  students  and  graduation 

rates. 

The  program,  targeted  for  minority  freshmen  and  transfer  students,  will  officially  get 
underway  in  January  1998.  But  before  the  program  is  instituted,  Judson  said  several  things 
have  to  occur. 

A  faculty  director  and  board  need  to  be  established,  student  assistants  recruited  and 
diversity  workshops  developed  for  faculty  members  participating  in  the  program. 

An  initial  step  occurred  this  summer.  Dr.  Fred  Edmondson,  the  senior  director  i  n  Student 
Life  at  California  State  University  at  Stanislaus  and  a  consultant  in  faculty  mentoring 
programs,  came  to  Plattsburgh  State.  He  met  with  faculty  and  administrators  to  discuss  the 
general  concept  and  success  of  the  faculty  mentoring  program  at  Stanislaus. 

Judson  said  goals  and  objectives  are  being  developed.  She  also  stated  minority  students 
will  have  to  understand  an  important  aspect  of  the  program  before  signing  on.  "They  will 
need  to  be  willing  to  accept  faculty  members  as  mentors  who  are  not  of  their  own  ethnicity,"  \ 
said  Judson. 

Recruitment  of  minority  students  will  get  underway  this  fall  and  a  social  gathering  for 
those  interested  in  the  program  will  be  held  in  early  October.  Judson  said  that  initially  faculty 
will  act  as  advisors  to  the  students.  Once  the  program  is  officially  underway,  students  will 
be  able  to  select  their  mentors.

"War  and  Its  Uses" 
Symposium  Oct.  2-4 
at  Plattsburgh  State 

This  year's  sixth  interdisciplinary  sym- 
posium in  the  "Plattsburgh  Studies  in  the 
Humanities"  series  at  Plattsburgh  State,  Oct. 
2-4,will  focus  on  all  different  types  of  war. 

With  "War  and  its  Uses:  Conflict  and 
Creativity"  as  the  theme,  scholars,  writers 
and  artists  from  across  the  United  States  and 
other  countries  will  gather  at  Plattsburgh 
State  to  discuss  their  views  on  a  wide  range 
of  war-related  issues. 

From  the  war  on  insects  and  mosquitoes, 
to  how  America's  leaders  decide  to  declare 
war  and  the  popular  music  during  wars, 
lecturers  will  have  the  opportunity  to  present 
their  beliefs. 

Coordinated  by  professors  Jurgen  Kleist 
and  Bruce  Butterfield,  the  symposium  at-

Faculty-Senate  to 
Meet  Sept.  30

"The  Quake" 
Replaces  WPLT 

No  it' s  not  another  new  radio  station  in  the 
Champlain  Valley.  It's  WQKE,  formerly 
WPLT,  Plattsburgh  State's  student  run  radio 
station. 

Since  the  mid  1970s  the  students  have 
been  rocking  the  FM  airwaves  for  listeners  on 
campus,  in  the  city  and  the  surrounding  areas. 
That  will  not  change  except  for  the  name. 

The  call  letters  WPLT  were  relinquished 
by  station  personnel  after  a  major  radio  net- 
work asked  the  students  to  give  up  the  letters. 

"WPLT  stood  for  'Pilot/"  said  Brian 
Larzelere,  station  manager  and  a  senior  mass 
communications  major  from  Clinton.  "With 
the  loss  of  the  air  force  base  a  couple  of  years 
ago,  it  just  didn't  seem  to  make  sense  to  hold 
onto  the  name  for  only  that  reason." 

"It  was  a  tough  decision  for  the  student 
management  of  the  station  to  make,"  said 
Stephen  Matthews,  the  college' s  FCC  license 
designee.  "So  many  alumni  before  them  have 
worked  at  the  station  under  the  former  call 
letters.  But,  they  felt  it  was  in  the  best  inter- 
ests of  the  station  and  future  students  who 
will  train  and  participate  in  the  operation  of 
the  radio  station  in  the  future." 

The  campus  radio  station  has  had  the  WPLT 
call  letters  since  before  1 974  when  the  station 
began  broadcasting  on  the  FM  band.  In  return 
for  relinquishing  the  call  letters,  the  station 
will  receive  an  undisclosed  contribution  that 
will  be  set  aside  in  an  endowment  for  future 
purposes  yet  to  be  determined. 

The  Federal  Communications  Commis- 
sion allocated  the  new  call  letters  which 
Larzelere  believes  will  be  useful  in  promo- 
tion of  the  station. 

WQKE,  or  "the  Quake,"  as  it's  being  called 
around  campus,  has  been  building  its 
listenership  since  students  turned  on  the  trans- 
mitter Sept.  8.  The  studios,  located  in  Yokum 
hall,  have  been  remodeled  and  equipment 
upgraded  the  last  several  years.  The  10  kilo- 
watt-radio station  can  be  heard  at  93.9  on  the 
FM  band. 


Landscapes  and  Scupltures  on  Display  Through  Sept.  30 

Crosby,  Osborn  Exhibition  in  Old  Forge 


Origins  -  Horizons  -  Signs,  an  exhibition  of  landscapes  by 
William  Crosby,  professor  of  art,  and  welded  steel  sculptures 
by  Don  Osborn,  professor  of  art,  are  on  display  at  the  Arts 
Center/Old  Forge  now  through  Sept.  30.  The  exhibit  is  on 
display  simultaneously  with  The  Adirondack  National  Exhibi- 
tion of  American  Watercolors. 

Crosby's  images  are  of  landscapes  from  Alaska,  coastal 
Maine  and  the  Adirondack-Lake  Champlain  region.  Some  of 


Osborn' s  sculptures  are  painted,  some  monochromatic,  with 
oxidation  creating  a  rust  effect. 

Crosby  also  has  another  exhibit  on  display  at  the  Arts  Center, 
Alaskan  Images,  a  display  of  black  and  white  and  color  photo- 
graphs of  Alaska. 

The  exhibition  is  open  to  the  public  10  a.m.  to  4  p.m.  daily 
and  noon  to  4  p.m.  on  Sundays  through  Sept.  30  at  the  Arts 
Center  in  Old  Forge.

New  Men's,  Women's  Basketball  Coaches  Appointed 


Plattsburgh  State's  basketball  programs 
are  betting  their  new  coaches  will  set  the 
courts  on  fire. 

Ed  Jones  has  been  appointed  head  coach 
of  the  men's  basketball  team  while  Cheryl 
Cole  has  been  named  his  counterpart  for  the 
women's  team. 

Jones,  who  was  previously  head  coach  at 
Utica  College  since  1987,  led  the  Utica  Pio- 
neers into  the  post-season  five  times  in  the 
1 0  years  he  had  been  at  the  helm  of  the  Divi- 
sion III  team. 

An  assistant  at  Utica  for  six  years  prior  to 
becoming  head  coach,  Jones  also  held  assis- 
tant positions  at  all  levels  in  college  coach- 
ing including  Manhattan  College,  Wayne 
State,  and  Rockland  Community  College.  He 
began  his  24-year  collegiate  coach  career  in 
1973  as  head  junior  varsity  coach  at 
Brockport  State. 

"Plattsburgh  is  a  terrific  school  with  an  ex- 
cellent commitment  to  athletics  and  a  qual- 
ity basketball  program,"  said  Jones.  "We  have 
a  nice  nucleus,  but  there  is  definitely  some 
building  to  do."  Jones  said. 

Since  taking  the  reigns  August  15,  Jones 
has  spent  90  percent  of  his  days  on  the  phone 


Jones  Cole 


recruiting.  He  said  that  the  refurbishments  to 
Memorial  Hall  gymnasium,  including  a  new 
hardwood  floor,  will  help  in  recruitment  of 
new  players. 

Jones  replaces  Larry  Cowan  who  was  ap- 
pointed director  of  athletics. 

Cole  was  head  women's  basketball  coach 
at  nearby  Paul  Smith's  College  since  1994. 
She  led  the  Paul  Smith's  Lady  Bobcats  to  the 
team's  most  wins  in  the  school  history  com- 
piling a  25-4  record  including  a  runner-up 
finish  in  the  NJCAA  Region  III,  Division  II 
tournament.  The  team  also  won  the  North- 
ern Independence  Conference  Championship 
the  past  two  seasons. 

The  1996/97  National  Junior  College  Ath- 
letic Association  Region  III,  Division  II  coach 

[8] 


of  the  year  will  continue  the  building  pro- 
cess begun  last  season  by  interim  women's 
head  basketball  coach  Erin  Griffin. 

"With  the  appointment  of  Cheryl  Cole,  I 
truly  believe  that  we  have  one  of  the  bright, 
young  coaching  talents  to  lead  our  women's 
basketball  program  into  the  future,"  said 
Cowan.  "This  is  particularly  pleasing  as  she 
will  add  stability,  credibility,  and  leadership 
which  the  current  players  in  the  program  de- 
serve, and  which  will  be  an  attraction  to  pro- 
spective student-athletes." 

A  native  of  Syracuse,  Cole  said  she  was 
attracted  to  the  prospects  of  coaching  a  ris- 
ing four-year  college  team.  "Plattsburgh  has 
shown  me  a  real  commitment  toward  build- 
ing a  successful  women's  basketball  program. 
I'm  excited  about  this  new  challenge." 

Cole  holds  a  B.A.  in  psychology  and  an 
M.S.  in  human  development  from  the  Uni- 
versity of  Rochester.  An  accomplished  col- 
legiate basketball  and  soccer  player,  Cole  was 
inducted  in  the  U.  of  R.  Hall  of  Fame  in  1995. 
Team  captain  of  the  1986  U.  of  R.  national 
championship  women's  soccer  team,  Cole 
also  served  as  the  assistant  athletic  director 
and  women's  soccer  coach  at  Paul  Smith's.

STATE  UNIVERSITY  OF  NEW  YORK 


PUBLISHED  BY  COLLEGE  RELATIONS  AND  DEVELOPMENT  FOR  THE  COLLEGE  COMMUNITY  â€¢  OCT.  2,  1997 


Plattsburgh  State  Receives  $554,600 
More  in  Funding  in  '97-98  State  Budget 


When  the  State  Legislature  approved  the 
1997-98  state  budget  this  summer,  Platts- 
burgh State  University  received 
a  $554,600  increase  over  last 
year's  state  appropriation. 

John  Homburger,  vice  presi- 
dent for  business  affairs,  said  the 
state's  funding  is  now  $28.67 
million. 

"There  seems  to  be  more  rec- 
ognition of  public  higher  educa- 
tion by  stopping  the  annual  re- 
ductions that  have  occurred  dur- 
ing the  past  seven  to  eight  years,"  said 
Homburger.  "The  increases  in  state  aid  is  a 
response,  although  it  is  a  small  increase." 

The  additional  money  is  earmarked  for 
contract  negotiated  salary  increases  (prima- 
rily with  CSEA  and  Council  82),  temporary 
services,  library  acquisitions,  equipment,  and 
utility  expenses. 

Homburger  also  said  there  will  be  some 
additional  funds  coming  from  SUNY  for 
meeting  fall  enrollment  goals. 


Homburger 


He  is  optimistic  that  some  projects,  which 
are  not  funded  directly  through  the  college' s 
budget,  will  be  given  the  go  ahead 
by  SUNY  Administration  in  Al- 
bany. They  include  redesign  of 
Amitie  Plaza,  planning  and  replace- 
ment of  the  rubber  floor  and  track 
in  the  Field  House,  and  upgrading 
of  fire  alarms  systems  on  campus. 

The  state  budget  allocated  a  total 
of  $  1 .5  billion  for  operations  of  the 
SUNY  campuses.  This  is  equal  to 
the  operating  budget  requested  by 
the  SUNY  Board  of  Trustees  last  fall,  which 
at  that  time  included  a  $34.4  million  increase 
in  State  tax  support  over  the  previous  year. 

"We  are  very  pleased  that  the  leaders  of 
our  state  have  favorably  responded  to  our 
budget  requests,"  said  SUNY  Board  of 
Trustees  Chairperson  Thomas  F.  Egan.  "This 
increased  financial  support  ensures  access, 
strengthens  academic  quality  and  helps  move 
our  university  into  the  front  ranks  of  Ameri- 
can higher  education." 


Laura  Dominy  Appointed  Financial  Aid  Director 

Laura  Dominy  has  officially  been  named  the  Director  of  Financial  Aid. 

Her  appointment  comes  after  she  was  named  interim  director  April  30 
when  Suzanne  Sokolowski,  the  long-time  head  of  the  financial  aid  office, 
retired,  and  a  lengthy  search  for  a  replacement  for  Sokolowski  proved 
fruitless. 

Laura  is  a  very  seasoned  professional  with  sound  judgement  and 
capable  of  addressing  the  changes  occurring  nationally  in  the  financial  aid 
arena,"  said  John  Homburger,  vice  president  for  business  affairs.  "She  has 
the  leadership  that  will  help  us  move  to  the  next  level."  Dominy 

Dominy  has  worked  for  Plattsburgh  State  since  coming  as  a  student  in  1972.  She  began 
in  the  Bursar  and  Payroll  offices  as  a  clerical  assistant.  Upon  graduation  from  Plattsburgh 
State  in  1976  with  a  B.A.  in  biology,  she  was  hired  as  a  staff  member  with  the  Educational 
Opportunity  Program.  She  worked  there  for  two  years,  first  as  an  assistant  to  the  learning 

(See  "Dominy  Appointed"  on  Page  3) 


Stafford  Provides 
$150,000  For  Three 
Academic  Programs 

Plattsburgh  State  has  received  a 
$150,000  member  item  from  Senator 
Ronald  B.  Stafford  to  support  the  Lake 
Champlain  Research  Institute,  the  Di  stance 
Learning  Project  in  Rural  Health  Care,  and 
the  purchase  of  equipment  for  the  mass 
media  program. 

During  the  past  seven  years,  Senator 
Stafford  has  authorized  legislative  initia- 
tives for  this  institution  totaling  more  than 
$4  million.  In  learning  of  the  latest  alloca- 
tion, President  Judson  said,  "Senator 
Stafford  deserves  the  thanks  of  our  entire 
College  community  for  his  continued  and 
long-standing  support  for  Plattsburgh  State. 
We  are  deeply  grateful  to  the  Senator  be- 
cause he  is  a  person  who  recognizes  the 
value  of  a  college  education  in  general  and 
the  quality  of  a  Plattsburgh  State  education 
in  particular." 

The  three  programs  that  will  receive 
funding  are: 

Lake  Champlain  Research  Institute. 
The  Institute  is  still  too  embryonic  to  de- 
velop an  independent  funding  stream  on  its 
own.  Since  the  current  Plattsburgh  State 
budget  cannot  support  the  additional  ex- 
pense of  the  Institute,  and  research  grants 
will  offer  only  partial  funding,  it  was  re- 
quested that  a  special  and  continuing  ap- 
propriation for  the  Institute  be  sought. 

Distance  Learning  Project  in  Rural 
Health  Care.  This  pilot  demonstration 
project  is  intended  for  the  health  primary 
application  area.  The  goal  is  to  provide 
health  information  programs  to  residents 
living  in  ten  rural,  medically  under-served, 
Northern  New  York  counties.  The  ten  coun- 
ties are  Clinton,  Essex,  Franklin,  Hamilton, 
Warren,  Washington,  St.  Lawrence, 
Jefferson,  Lewis  and  Herkimer 

Equipment  for  Television  Studios  for 
Mass  Media  Program.  The  equipment  in 
the  television  studios  is  rapidly  becoming 
outdated.  A  legislative  initiative  will  alle- 
viate using  institutional  funds  to  replace 
this  equipment. 


Shaffer  Featured  in  No  Mercy:  A  Journey  to  the  Heart  of  the  Congo 


Plattsburgh  State  Psychology  Professor  Dr.  Lary  Shaffer  would 
prefer  traveling  the  swamps  of  the  Congo  basin  to  scrapping  the 
paint  off  his  house. 

"Wouldn't  everyone?"  Shaffer  asked. 

Shaffer  actually  has  right  to  lay  claim  to  that  observa- 
tion, having  traveled  the  swamps  of  the  Congo  basin  the 
summer  of  1989  with  long-time  friend  and  travel-adven- 
ture author  Redmond  O'Hanlon,  on  a  quest  for  a  prehis- 
toric beast  rumored  to  live  deep  within  the  forest.  The  re- 
sultant book,  No  Mercy:  A  Journey  to  the  Heart  of  the 
Congo,  chronicles  the  pair's  jungle  adventures  and  misad- 
ventures in  an  often  comical,  sometimes  foreboding  narrative. 

"I  had  known  O'Hanlon  in  grad  school  and  had  wanted  to  go 
with  him  on  earlier  trips,  but  we  could  not  make  the  schedules  work," 
Shaffer  said.  "My  assignment  was  to  take  pictures  for  the  book." 
Shaffer  has  a  background  in  film  making  and  photography. 

"O'Hanlon  worked  very  hard  taking  notes  about  everything,  and 
â€”  inasmuch  as  the  government  permitted  me  to  â€”  I  worked  hard 
photographing.  We  both  spent  considerable  time  trying  to  plan  the 
next  move  as  there  was  no  public  transport  once  we  left  the  river." 


Shaffer 


Shaffer,  who  admits  he  hasn't  read  the  book,  which  has  been  out 
since  April  of  this  year,  said  he  saw  some  of  the  early  manuscript, 
"but  this  is  in  no  way  'my'  book.  It  is  O'Hanlon's  story 
about  the  trip  we  took,"  he  said. 

It  may  also  be  O'Hanlon's  movie  about  the  trip  they  took. 
There's  talk  that  a  movie  deal  has  been  discussed. 

O'Hanlon  told  Shaffer  in  a  phone  conversation  that  the 
book  "has  been  bought  by  a  Hollywood  deal-maker  who 
puts  together  packages  of  books,  stars,  directors,  etc.,  and 
tries  to  sell  them  to  studios  or  other  financial  backers," 
Shaffer  said.  "The  package  for  'No  Mercy'  included 
Harrison  Ford,  who  had  read  the  book  and  was  interested  in  play- 
ing the  character  that  O'Hanlon  has  written  as  me." 

Shaffer  said  he  last  heard  the  project  "had  about  a  one  in  50 
chance  of  actually  being  made. 

"Needless  to  say,  most  movie  deals  fall  through,  although  this 
one  has  progressed  farther  than  many  others,"  he  said. 

Shaffer  said  he  and  his  Congo  companion  keep  in  touch  regu- 
larly, "and  he  visited  us  in  Plattsburgh  last  summer  at  the  end  of  his 
American  book  tour,"  he  said. 


Seven  Year  Mystery  Resolved 


City  Hall  Plans  Found  in  Special  Collections 


City  Hall  in  Plattsburgh  was  constructed 
in  1918  by  nationally-renowned  architect 
John  Russell  Pope.  A  number  of  changes 
have  occurred  during  the  past  80  years. 

However,  no  one  has  known  for  nearly 
twenty-years  how  similar  or  different  those 
changes  have  been  in  relation  to  the  original 
architectural  drawing  for  the  Plattsburgh 
City  Hall  have  been  missing  for  many  years. 
That  is,  until  recently  when  the  original 
sketches  and  a  blueprint  were  found  among 
the  files  in  the  Special  Collections  in  Feinberg 
Library. 

The  designs  detail  the  city  hall  building 
commission's  original  floor  plans.  City  Hall 
today  is  somewhat  different  due  to  the  alter- 
ations made  over  the  years  and  to  changes 
called  for  by  Plattsburgh  citizens  after  re- 
jecting the  original  plans  in  1916. 

Working  with  Wayne  Miller,  librarian  in 
Special  Collections,  Plattsburgh  City  Clerk 
Keith  Herkalo  located  the  drawings  among 
other  documents  in  Feinberg  Library.  Al- 
though no  one  knows  exactly  when  the  draw- 
ings disappeared  from  the  city's  archives, 
Miller  said  records  indicate  that  the  designs 
were  given  to  Special  Collections  in  1 974  by 
an  anonymous  donor. 

"This  is  just  wonderful,  just  wonderful," 
said  Herkalo,  who  has  been  searching  for  the 
plans  for  the  past  seven  years.  "They  are 
great  stewards  here  and  protect  the  intellec- 


Plattsburgh  City  Clerk  Keith  Herkalo  (far  right)  explains  to  Wayne  Miller,  Special  Collections  librarian, 
Carla  Hendrix,  Special  Collections  librarian,  and  Cerise  Oberman,  dean  of  library  and  informational 
services,  that  city  residents  in  1916  objected  to  the  city  hall  building  commission's  attempt  to  approve  the 
plans  during  an  afternoon  meeting  while  most  people  were  working.  Plattsburgh  citizens  eventually  voted 
to  reject  the  plans  at  an  evening  meeting  in  the  Clinton  County  Courthouse  on  Aug.  28, 1916.  Several  changes 
were  made  and  the  facility  was  completed  two  years  later. 


tual  integrity  of  the  college." 

The  designs,  which  also  detail  the  plot 
plan  of  City  Hall  in  relation  to  MacDonough 
Monument,  were  turned  over  to  Herkalo  and 
the  City  of  Plattsburgh  on  Sept.,  24  to  be 
placed  in  the  city's  special  temperature  and 

[2] 


humidity-controlled  storage  room.  A  full- 
size  copy  of  the  drawings  will  be  made 
available  for  Special  Collections. 

Herkalo,  beaming  over  the  plans,  said,  "A 
mystery  has  come  to  an  end." 


Family  Weekend  at  Plattsburgh  State  a  Success 


Runners  head  out  for  the  three-mile  Fun  Run  and  Walk  on  Saturday  morning  during  Family  Weekend. 
Parents,  grandparents,  siblings  and  friends  had  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  a  variety  of  activities 
during  the  weekend.  Joe  Clark,  the  former  principal  who  won  fame  for  turning  Eastside  High  School  in 
Paterson,  N.I,  into  a  model  educational  institution,  was  the  guest  speaker  during  the  weekend. 


Kick-off  Set  For  Oct.  16 

SEFA  Appeal  Reaches  for  $35,000 

Reaching  for  old  heights"  is  the  theme  at  Plattsburgh  State  as  the  State  employees 
Federated  Appeal  kick-off  Sept.  1 6. 

Marlyn  Cotter,  one  of  the  campus  coordinators  for  the  SEFA  campaign  along  with 
John  Homburger  and  Peter  Luguri,  said,  "Our  goal  this  year  is  to  reach  $35,000.  The 
high  number  of  employees  retiring  during  the  past  two  years  has  had  a  dramatic  impact 
on  our  support  of  charitable  organizations  in  our  area." 

Last  falTs  appeal  at  state  agencies  in  Clinton  and  Essex  counties  raised  $93,680.68, 
down  from  the  1996  appeal  total  of  $98,394. 

Plattsburgh  State  was  one  of  eight  agencies  where  charitable  support  decreased  in 
the  1 997  appeal  from  the  previous  year.  Contributions  by  Plattsburgh  State  employees 
last  fall  reached  $33,445,  down  from  the  previous  year's  amount  of  $36,025. 

"We  hope  everyone  here  can  give  just  a  little  more  toward  their  favorite  organiza- 
tions," said  Cotter. 

The  kick-off  breakfast  for  coordinators  will  be  held  Thursday,  Oct.  16,  at  8:30  a.m. 
in  the  Plattsburgh  Room,  Angell  College  Center.

In  1978,  Dominy  was  hired  as  a  financial 
aid  advisor  and  the  college  work-study  pro-

Faculty  Encouraged  to  Participate  in  International  Recruitment  Program 


Plattsburgh  State  has  taken  several  steps 
to  increase  the  number  of  international  stu- 
dents in  the  undergraduate  population. 

Edward  Engelbride,  assistant  to  the  asso- 
ciate provost,  said  students  in  approximately 
30  countries  are  targeted  through  the  Interna- 
tional Student  Recruitment  Program.  He  said 
that  a  number  of  efforts  are  underway  to 
attract  more  international  students  including 
informational  mailings  to  select  locations, 
networking  with  embassies,  personalized  cor- 
respondences, and  the  use  of  existing  tech- 


nologies to  communicate  more  efficiently 
with  applicants. 

While  these  efforts  will  result  in  increases 
in  the  number  of  inquiries,  personalized  con- 
tact is  one  of  the  most  effective  recruitment 
strategies,"  said  Engelbride.  Faculty  travel- 
ing abroad  to  speak  at  international  confer- 
ences, conduct  research,  vacation  or  partici- 
pate in  cultural  exchanges  would  be  excel- 
lent ''recruitment  ambassadors"  for  the  col- 
lege. 

Faculty  participating  in  this  program 

[5] 


would  be  asked  to  meet  with  a  guidance 
counselor,  educational  advisor,  or  embassy 
official  and  provide  information  about  our 
college,  our  academic  programs,  scholar- 
ship opportunities,  as  well  as  the  English 
language  support  program." 

Engelbride  said,  "Everyone  can  play  an 
important  role  in  attracting  new  students  to 
Plattsburgh  State."  Interested  individuals  can 
contact  Engelbride  in  the  Student  Affairs 
office  at  564-2280.

Cardinal  Men's  Soccer  Team  Sweeps  Games  on  The  Road 


The  Pittsburgh  State  men* s  soccer  team 
had  a  successful  road  trip,  defeating  Os- 
wego and  Cortland  to  stay  a  perfect  4-0  in 
the  State  University  of  New  York  athletic 
Conference  and  improve  to  6-1-0  overall. 

Friday,  the  Cardinals  got  a  five-point 
effort  (2  goals,  1  assist)  from  junior  Mike 
Paolini  of  Liverpool,  to  roll  past  Oswego 
3-2.  Paolini  tallied  twice  in  the  first  half, 
both  assisted  by  Pat  McMahon,  a  sopho- 
more from  Scottsville,  to  put  Plattsburgh 
up  2-1  at  the  intermission.  The  men 
wasted  no  time  getting  their  third  and  fi- 
nal goal  of  the  game.  With  just  over  a 
minutes  elapsed  in  the  second  stanza, 
sophomore  Christian  Gondek  from  Chazy, 
scored  off  a  double  assist  from  Paolini  and 
junior  Kevin  Riddleberger  of  Endicott,  to 
seal  the  victory  for  Plattsburgh. 

On  Saturday,  the  men  completed  the 
weekend  sweep  with  a  2-0  victory  over 
Cortland.  Junior  Phil  Lombardo  of 


Holtsville  put  the  Cardinals  on  the 
board  at  20:50  of  the  first  half  with  a 
goal  assisted  by  Riddleberger  to  give 
the  men  a  1-0  advantage  at  the  half. 
Gondek  provided  Plattsburgh  with 
an  insurance  goal  less  than  two  min- 
utes into  the  second  half,  blasting  a 
cross  from  Marc  Hinds,  a  freshman 
from  Rochester,  into  the  back  of  the 
Cortland  net. 

Andrew  Cumbo,  a  sophomore  from 
Fairport  made  three  saves  and  Mike 
Kuznia,  a  freshman  from  Syracuse, 
made  five  saves  to  combine  for  the 
shutout. 

The  men's  soccer  team,  currently 
first  place  in  the  SUNYAC,  second  in 
New  York  State,  and  ranked  15th  in 
the  nation,  take  a  break  from  their 
conference  schedule  to  face  non-con- 
ference opponent  Thomas  College 
from  Maine  on  Saturday,  Oct.  4. 


Cardinal  star  Mike  Paolini  of  Liverpool  knows  how  to

Area  Schools  Benefit  From  Community  Service  Scholarships 


Kimberly  Accettella  is  no  stranger  to  per- 
forming community  service. 

The  17-year-old  Plattsburgh  State  fresh- 
man, majoring  in  special  elementary  educa- 
tion, has  been  involved  in  volunteer  services 
since  she  could  walk  in  her  Babylon,  Long 
Island  home. 

So  it  was  no  surprise  she  applied  for,  and 
was  granted,  one  of  10  community  service 
scholarships  funded  by  the  Office  of  Cam- 
pus Life  this  year. 

"One  of  the  prerequisites  of  the  scholar- 
ship is  a  history  of  community  service," 
Accettella  said.  "My  dad  is  involved  in  poli- 
tics at  home,  and  I've  been  helping  out  on 
his  campaigns  since  I  was  a  little  girl.  I've 
always  been  involved.  I  served  as  a  tutor  for 
two  years  to  a  girl  in  special  education.  I've 
done  beach  clean-ups  every  summer  (on  Fire 
Island).  My  senior  year  in  high  school  I  per- 
formed 300  hours  of  community  service." 

The  Plattsburgh  State  opportunity  came 
in  the  form  of  a  letter  Accettella  received  in 
the  mail.  "I  had  to  fill  out  an  application, 
which  was  essentially  seven  mini-essays," 
she  said.  'The  number  of  applicants  were 


cut  down  to  finalists,  and  they  took  the 
top  10." 

Bryan  Hartman,  coordinator  of  the 
program  in  the  Office  of  Campus  Life, 
sent  a  mailing  to  all  incoming  freshmen 
and  transfer  students  accepted  into  the 
college  describing  community  service 
on  campus  and  the  opportunity  to  ap- 
ply for  the  scholarship. 

'There  is  an  application  and  inter- 
view process,"  he  said.  "A  committee 
set  up  by  Provost  Thomas  Moran  re- 
views the  finalists'  folders  and  recom- 
mends 10  recipients,"  he  said.  "The  de- 
cision is  based  on  past  participation  in 
service,  letters  of  recommendations, 
interviews  (and)  a  sense  of  a  commit- 
ment to  service." 

Recipients  get  $500  per  semester  to- 
ward tuition  from  the  Plattsburgh  Col- 
lege Foundation;  $100  per  semester  to- 
ward the  meal  plan  from  College  Aux- 
iliary Services;  and  half  off  room  rent 
for  a  double  room  on  campus. 

Accettella  works  12  hours  a  week  at 
Cumberland  Head  Elementary  School  help- 


Freshman  Sarah  Greene  cuddles  one  of  the  children  she 
works  with  at  Cham  plain  Valley  Tech  as  part  of  her  com- 
munity service. 

ing  out  in  grades  3,  4  and  5  and  in  a  special 
education  class.

Zelda  Holcomb,  Chris  Pak  Named  to  SUNY  Alumni  Honor  Roll 


Plattsburgh  State  has 
nominated  two  alumni  for 
the  1997  SUNY  Alumni 
Honor  Roll. 

Dr.  Zelda  Holcomb, 
Class  of  1971,  was  nomi- 
nated for  her  significant 
Holcomb  Pak  contributions  to  higher 

education  and  for  her  outstanding  success  in  her  profession. 

Dr.  Koon  Yan  "Chris"  Pak,  a  1974  graduate  of  Plattsburgh 
State,  was  selected  for  his  significant  contributions  in  education, 
particularly  in  the  field  of  science,  and  for  his  eminent  accom- 
plishments in  his  profession. 


The  two  will  be  honored  at  the  SUNY  Alumni  Conference  on 
Nov.  15  in  Binghamton. 

Holcomb  is  currently  chief  of  educational  accountability  for  the 
180  schools  in  the  Baltimore  City  Public  School  system.  Her 
office  initiates  programs  to  hold  schools  and  teachers  accountable 
for  student  achievement. 

She  graduated  from  Plattsburgh  State  in  1971  and  earned  her 
master' s  degree  in  educational  psychology  from  the  College  of  St. 
Rose  in  Albany  and  her  Ph.D.  in  educational  research  at  the  Ohio 
State  University  in  Columbus,  Ohio. 

Holcomb  has  worked  in  various  educational  positions  includ- 
ing posts  with  the  College  of  St.  Rose,  University  of  Delaware,

Welcome  Alumni  to  Homecoming  '97  October  17  - 19 


Dr.  Hiroshi  Itoh  to  "Probe"  Japan's  Judicial  Minds 


Itoh 


Japanese  judges  and  the  I 
decisions  they  make  will 
be  scrutinized  in  an  18- 
month  project  being 
mounted  by  a  Plattsburgh 
State  political  science  pro- 
fessor. 

Dr.  Hiroshi  Itoh,  an  ex- 
pert in  the  field  of  Japanese 
law,  has  been  awarded  a  $52,590  U.S.  De- 
partment of  Education/Fulbright-Hays  Fac- 
ulty Research  Abroad  grant  to  "probe 
(Japan's)  judicial  minds  through  the  infor- 
mation coming  directly  from  the  judges' 
mouths,"  Itoh  writes  in  his  grant  application. 

The  project,  called  "Constitutional  Liti- 
gation in  Japan:  How  Judges  Think  They 
Decide,"  Itoh  will  conduct  a  series  of  inter- 
views with  Supreme  Court  justices  and  other 
decision  makers  like  law  clerks,  lower  court 
judges  and  private  attorneys. 

"Each  justice  responded  orally  to  a  set  of 
questions  ranging  from  personal  back- 
grounds to  his  activities  in  the  courtroom," 
Itoh  said.  "Judicial  accounts  of  interactions 
among  co-decision  makers  contains  a  wealth 
of  information  on  both  the  psychological  and 


sociological  dimensions  of  the  judicial 
thought  process."  Narratives  were  cross- 
checked with  those  of  other  justices  for  ac- 
curacy and  credibility,  Itoh  said. 

The  constitution  in  Japan,  established  in 
1947,  is  the  "supreme,  organic  and  basic  law 
in  Japan,"  according  to  Itoh.  In  the  absence 
of  constitutional  revisions  since  its  inception, 
the  courts,  especially  the  Supreme  Court, 
have  played  a  vital  role  in  interpreting  con- 
stitutional and  inferior  laws  in  the  process 
of  settling  legal  disputes. 

"Resulting  judicial  policies  have  greatly 
affected  political  and  socioeconomic  activi- 
ties of  the  society,"  Itoh  said.  "They  have 
contributed  to  political  stability  and  predict- 
ability, which  in  turn  provided  a  basis  for 
economic  growth  and  democracy  for  the  past 
half  century." 

Itoh  said  his  proposed  research  is  among 
the  first  to  analyze  judicial  impact  and  feed- 
back in  depth  and  is  relevant  to  the  college's 
efforts  to  strengthen  global  studies. 

"(Plattsburgh  State)  has,  over  26  years, 
offered  Japanese  government  and  law  as  an 
integral  component  of  global  perspectives," 
he  said.  "The  college  has  also  been  selec- 


tive in  distinguishing  itself  on  its  members' 
scholarly  achievements  and  international 
recognition." 

Itoh's  research  will  take  him  to  Japan  and 
the  libraries  at  the  (Japan)  Supreme  Court 
and  Keio  University,  of  which  he  will  be 
affiliated  with  the  faculty  of  law. 

"Most  of  this  research  involves  interviews 
with  justices,  government  officials,  private 
attorneys  and  constitutional  scholars  inside 
Japan  and  cannot  be  done  anywhere  else," 
he  said.  "One  overriding  reason  for  relative 
ease  ...  to  secure  access  to  Supreme  Court 
justices  and  former  prime  ministers  seems 
to  be  that  they  are  less  suspicious  toward 
serious  researchers  from  overseas;  knowing 
that  that  their  remarks  and  comments  will 
not  be  used  for  political  or  mass  media-in- 
spired publicity." 

Itoh  has  presented  his  research  results 
both  in  the  United  States  and  Japan  on  nu- 
merous occasions  and  has  been  published  in 
Japan.  A  book  authored  by  Itoh  in  1989  on 
the  Japanese  Supreme  Court  is  being  trans- 
lated into  Japanese  for  a  Japanese  audience. 


Community  Service  (Continued  from  Page  1) 


"I  help  teachers  do  bulletin  boards,  grade 
papers,  give  extra  help  to  students  if  they're 
behind  in  their  work,"  she  said.  "It's  perfect 
for  my  major.  It's  like  a  pre-internship.  It's  a 
wonderful  advantage  and  I'm  learning  a  lot 
â€”  I'm  learning  that  it's  what  I  really  want 
to  do." 

The  1 2  hours  she  works  at  the  school  are 
in  addition  to  the  17  credit  hours  she  takes 
as  a  freshman.  It  leaves  little  time  for  free 
time.  "But  it  keeps  me  focused,"  Accettella 
said.  "I  realize  what  I  want  to  be  is  a  teacher. 
I  see  my  goal  right  in  front  of  me." 

Sarah  Greene,  an  18-year-old  freshman 
majoring  in  speech  and  hearing  disorders,  is 
another  of  the  10  scholarship  recipients  this 
inaugural  year.  Her  project  is  working  with 
special  education  clients  of  Champlain  Val- 
ley Tech. 

"I  really  like  (the  program),"  Greene  said. 
"I  see  a  lot  of  things  I'll  have  to  learn  in  my 
major.  It's  a  lot  of  fun." 

Like  Accettella,  Greene  has  been  involved 
in  numerous  community-service  projects  in 
her  hometown  of  Keeseville.  She  was  presi- 
dent of  the  Key  Club  at  AuSable  Valley  Cen- 
tral School,  a  community-service  organiza- 
tion; she  organized  and  participated  in 
fundraisers  for  groups  like  the  Association 
for  Retarded  Citizens  and  Muscular  Dystro- 
phy Association. 


'The  idea  behind  the  scholarship  is  to  rec- 
ognize students  involved  with  community 
service  and  to  provide  an  avenue  to  continue 
service  here  in  college  while  at  the  same  time 
rewarding  that  involvement,"  said  Hartman. 

Hartman  said  Plattsburgh  State  is  the  first 
of  the  SUNY  schools  to  have  implemented 
such  a  program  with  others  working  to  cre- 


ate similar  programs  on  their  campuses. 

Hartman  submitted  the  proposal  to  cre- 
ate the  scholarship  program  based  on  his 
experience  and  involvement  with  the  Clinton 
County  AmeriCorps  program,  he  said. 

"Both  these  scholarships  and  AmeriCorps 
combine  service  with  education.  To  me,  this 
\%  a  win-win  situation,"  Hartman  said. 


Benefit  Information  Day  Set  For  Oct.  21 

Plattsburgh  State  and  its  unions  will  be  hosting  a  Benefit  Information  Day  on  Tuesday, 
Oct.  21,  from  9  a.m.  to  3  p.m.  in  the  Warren  Ballrooms  of  Angell  College  Center. 

This  event  will  provide  college  employees  the  opportunity  to  receive  information 
pertaining  to  the  benefits  available  to  them,  including  health  insurance,  retirement,  dental 
and  vision. 

According  to  Maria  Visco,  personnel  associate,  employees  have  been  authorized  one 
hour  of  release  time  or  one  hour  of  compensatory  time  for  those  employees  not  working,  to 
attend  this  event,  pending  supervisor  approval. 

Visco  is  also  encouraging  employees  to  stop  by  the  Empire  Plan-MetraHealth  Insurance 
table  to  recommend  the  insurance  company  recruit  more  participating  providers  in  the 
Burlington  area. 

"Many  times  state  employees  are  referred  to  non-participating  physicians  in  Vermont  and 
face  deductibles  for  these  referrals,"  said  Visco.  "Our  employees  can  persuade  Empire  Plan- 
MetraHealth  to  recruit  more  physicians  in  the  Burlington  area  by  stopping  at  their  table 
during  the  day." 

Two  workshops  will  also  be  conducted  in  the  Plattsburgh  Room.  Staff  from  Cornell 
Cooperative  Extension  will  discuss  financial  stability  at  10  a.m  while  members  of  TIAA- 
CREF  will  explain  retirement  options  available  during  a  3  p.m.  workshop. 

Door  prizes  will  be  available  for  participants. 

Anyone  with  questions,  can  contact  Visco  in  the  Personnel  Office  at  Ext.  5062.

Plattsburgh  State  alumni  from  across  the 
country  will  be  returning  to  their  alma  mater

friends  and  guests,  will  be  participating  in 
the  events  on  Friday,  Saturday  and  Sunday. 

"We  have  some  new  and  exciting  activi-

breakfast  Saturday  morning,  and  the  1997

Homecoming  is  for  all  alumni  to  come 
back  and  celebrate  their  Plattsburgh  experi- 
ence, with  special  attention  paid  this  year  to

Lifelong  Learning 
Reviews  Summer 
Course  Offerings 


Worthington 


The  Center  for 
Lifelong  Learning 
is  attempting  to  ex- 
pand  summer 
school  offerings  by 
working  closely 
with  faculty  and 
students. 

Dr.  Janet  Worth- 
ington, director  of 
the  Center  for  Life- 
long Learning,  says 
that  the  1998  summer  session  will  consist  of 
two  five-week  sessions,  with  a  variety  of 
other  options  ranging  up  to  10  weeks. 

"Faculty  members  have  identified  pro- 
jected courses  which  they  would  be  inter- 
ested in  teaching  during  the  summer,"  said 
Worthington.  "these  projected  courses  will 
be  listed  in  the  spring  schedule.  We  are  now 
attempting  to  define  the  types  of  offerings 
students  would  be  most  interested  in  during 
the  summer." 

In  an  effort  to  solicit  information  from 
students,  the  Center  will  be  sending  out 
questionaires  to  students  via  campus  mail 
and  e-mail.  The  surveys  will  be  collected  in 
drop  boxes  in  the  Angell  College  Center. 

"We  need  to  identify  what  courses  stu- 
dents would  be  interested  in  taking  during 
the  summer,  and  we  will  try  our  best  to  meet 
their  needs,"  said  Worthington.  "If  a  student 
suggest  a  course  be  offered  during  the  sum- 
mer, they  will  not  be  required  to  take  these 
courses,  nor  can  we  guarantee  that  all  sug- 
gested courses  will  be  offered" 

The  Center  for  Lifelong  Learning  will 
also  seek  information  from  Plattsburgh  and 
Clinton  County  residents  about  courses  they 
would  be  interested  in  during  June  and  July. 

Individuals  with  suggestions  for  summer 
courses  can  contact  the  Center  for  Lifelong 
Learning  at  564-2050  or  email  birdce 
@  splava.cc.plattsburgh.edu,  or  drop  in  to

Events  Planned  For 
National  Alcohol 
Awareness  Week 

Plattsburgh  State  students  will  cel- 
ebrate National  Collegiate  Alcohol 
Awareness  Week  Oct.  20-25  with  sev- 
eral events,  both  social  and  educational, 
planned. 

The  week  has  grown  to  become  the 
largest  event  of  its  type  because  stu- 
dents take  the  opportunity  to  design  and 
implement  the  observance  to  promote 
personal  responsibility  and  positive  de- 
cision making  regarding  alcohol  and 
other  substance  use. 

"Not  all  college  students  are  abusing 
alcohol,  and  others  are  finally  begin- 
ning to  realize  that,"  said  Katrina  Day, 
graduate  assistant  at  Plattsburgh  State' s 
Wellness  Center. 

Participation  by  more  clubs  and  or- 
ganizations in  hosting  events  through- 
out the  week  is  a  sign  of  progress  on  the 
local  campus.  Additionally,  Banks  Hall 
has  been  designated  as  wellness  and 
substance-free  housing  for  students  who 
not  want  alcohol  to  be  a  part  of  their 
living  environment. 

During  alcohol  awareness  week 
Plattsburgh  State  students  will  have  the 
opprotunity  to  participate  in  several 
events,  including: 

â™¦  Pieces  of  the  Puzzle:  the  Issues  of  a 
Generation.  A  fun  comedy/drama/mu- 
sical act  highlighting  issues  surround- 
ing alcohol  use  on  Oct.  20, 8  p.m.,  Flynt 
Commons,  Angell  College  Center. 

â™¦  Monday  Night  Football  at  the  Fit- 
ness Center. 

â™¦  Fatal  Vision  Goggles.  Public  Safety 
will  have  goggles  that  allow  one  to 
experience  the  impaired  vision  of  an 
intoxicated  person,  Oct.  22,  1 1  a.m.  -  1 
p.m.  Angell  College  Center  lobby. 

â™¦  Milk  and  Cookies  Party!  Sponsored 
by  Pi  Kappa  Phi,  Oct.  23, 7  -  9  p.m.,  55-

Party,  Oct.  25,  7:30  â€”  1 1:30  p.m.,  War-

The  National  Collegiate  Alcohol 
Awareness  Week  originated  in  1983  on 
only  25  campuses.  Plattsburgh  State  has 
been  recognized  the  past  two  years  as 
one  of  10  colleges  in  the  country  with 
outstanding  alcohol  awareness  pro- 
grams.

Saying  he  thought  he  had  "an  outside 
chance"  of  winning  the  SUNYAC  men's 
cross  country  championship,  senior  distance 
runner  Walter  Long  of  Smithtown  covered 
the  course  in  a  time  of  26:08  to  win  the  men's 
individual  race  and  become  the  fourth  Car- 
dinal runner  to  win  the  individual  SUNYAC 
Championship,  Oct.  18  in  Buffalo. 

"I  knew  I  had  an  outside  chance  of  win- 


ning the  championship,  but  I  really  would 
have  to  run  a  great  race  to  win,"  said  Long. 
"I  worked  with  my  team  mates  and  suc- 
ceeded." 

Those  teammates  are  Corey  Davidson  of 
Cadyville  who  placed  third,  Ken  Drake  of

STATE  UNIVERSITY  OF  NEW  YORK  Â£j 


PUBLISHED  BY  COLLEGE  RELATIONS  AND  DEVELOPMENT  FOR  THE  COLLEGE  COMMUNITY  â€¢  October  30,  1 997 


Foundation  Receives  $302,000  Bequest  From  Alice  Moyer 


The  Plattsburgh  College  Foundation  has 
received  a  $302,000  bequest  from  the  estate 
of  the  late  Alice  S.  Moyer,  the  wife  of  a 
former  faculty  member,  who  died  Dec.  30, 
1995  at  the  age  of  93. 

The  gift  is  one  of  the  largest  bequests  ever 
received  by  the  Foundation  and  is  the  third 
largest  received  from  an  individual. 

Undergraduate  students  with  financial 
need  will  benefit  from  the  Dr.  Haverly  O. 
and  Alice  S.  Moyer  Endowment  Fund,  also 
named  in  honor  of  Mrs.  Moyer' s  late  hus- 
band. 

President  Horace  A.  Judson  praised  the 
late  Mrs.  Moyer.  "We  are  deeply  grateful  to 
have  enjoyed  Mrs.  Moyer' s  confidence  and 
support  over  the  years,  and  we  are  honored 
by  her  bequest.  Most  of  all,  we  are  thankful 
to  be  able  to  offer  new  opportunities  for 
Plattsburgh  State  undergraduates  for  years 
to  come. 

"Traditionally,  bequests  to  the  Plattsburgh 
College  Foundation  have  been  the  main 
source  of  endowment  support,"  added 
Judson.  "Just  as  the  bequests  of  past  alumni 
and  friends  have  helped  to  create  the 
Plattsburgh  State  of  today,  the  continuation 
of  this  tradition  of  remembrance  will  help  to 
ensure  that  there  will  be  a  financially  strong 
and  academically  excellent  Plattsburgh  State 
for  tomorrow. " 

Mrs.  Moyer,  a  resident  of  Cumberland 


Head,  taught  at  the  College' s  former  cam- 
pus school  for  several  years,  then  at  C hazy 
Central  Rural  School  before  joining  the 
faculty  of  the  Plattsburgh  City  School 
District  where  she  taught  at  Broad  Street 
School  for  21  years,  retiring  in  June  1968. 

Dr.  Haverly  O.  Moyer  served  on  the 
faculty  of  Plattsburgh  State  for  32  years 
as  a  professor  of  education  and  retired  in 
1969,  when  he  was  granted  professor 
emeritus  status.  He  died  Oct.  3,  1972. 

"The  Foundation  certainly  appreciates 
the  fact  that  Mrs.  Moyer  thought  so  highly 
of  the  College  to  make  such  a  significant 
gift,"  said  Don  Garrant,  executive  direc- 
tor of  the  Foundation.  "She  and  her  hus- 
band were  part  of  the  college  community 
for  many  years.  He  was  one  of  our  out- 
standing professors  of  education,  and  she 
was  one  of  the  top  educators  in  the 
Plattsburgh  City  School  District.  It  was 
very  thoughtful  of  them  to  set  up  an  endow- 
ment fund  for  needy  students.  We  have  a 
significant  number  of  students  in  need  of 
financial  assistance." 

Mrs.  Moyer  was  active  in  Girl  Scouting, 
bird  watching,  travel  and  gardening  and  was 
involved  in  activities  of  the  College.  A  sup- 
porter of  the  Kent  Delord  House  Museum, 
Hospice  and  the  Audubon  Society,  she  was 
a  member  of  the  First  Baptist  Church. 

The  largest  bequest  received  to  date  by  the 


Alice  Moyer  (File  photo) 
Foundation  was  a  gift  of  $676,042  from  the 
estate  of  the  late  Dr.  Edward  E.  Redcay, 
former  academic  dean  of  the  College  and 
director  of  the  Honors  Program,  who  spent 
more  than  50  years  of  his  life  at  the  institu- 
tion. 

George  Winkel  and  his  wife,  Nina,  who 
donated  most  of  her  sculptures  to  the  Col- 
lege, and  for  whom  the  Winkel  Sculpture 
Court  was  built  and  named,  provided  a 
planned  gift  of  $623,999  to  the  College. 


One  of  Two  Geochemists  in  Ocean  Crust  Exploration 

Adams  Analyzing  Atlantic  Ocean  Bottom  Samples 


Dr.  Donald  Adams, 
a  professor  in  the  Cen- 
ter for  Earth  and  Envi- 
ronmental Science,  re- 
cently spent  two 
months  aboard  a  drill 
ship  off  the  coast  of 
Africa. 

Adams  was  one  of 
two  organic  geochem- 
ists asked  by  the  Ocean  Drilling  Program  to 
participate  in  August  and  September  in  an 
on-going  exploration  of  the  ocean  crust  and 
is  now  working  with  24  other  scientists  from 
nine  different  countries  analyzing  data  col- 
lected from  the  bottom  of  the  Atlantic  Ocean 
off  the  coast  of  southwest  Africa.  His  work 
will  take  him  away  from  campus  throughout 


Adams 


the  rest  of  the  semester. 

Adams,  whose  project  is  funded  by  a 
$38,898  grant  from  the  Joint  Oceanographic 
Institutions  and  the  National  Science  Foun- 
dation, is  an  expert  on  sediment  gases.  His 
time  on  board  the  drill  ship  JOIDES  Resolu- 
tion was  spent  measuring  sediment  gases, 
which  provide  signatures  of  past  oceano- 
graphic processes  and  climates.  Adams  also 
served  as  one  of  the  safety  officers  who  made 
decisions  on  whether  to  abandon  drill  sites  if 
they  posed  a  danger  from  fire  or  explosion 
from  gases  or  if  they  were  drilling  into  petro- 
leum deposits. 

JOIDES  (pronounced  JOY-DEEZ)  stands 
for  the  Joint  Oceanographic  Institutions  for 
Deep  Earth  Sampling.  The  ship  is  a  47 1  -foot 
converted  oil  drilling  rig  whose  maiden  voy- 


Students  Use  Co-Curricular  Transcripts  to 
Enhance  Resumes,  Academic  Transcripts 


Plattsburgh  State  University  students  who 
are  active  in  civic  and  campus  programs  now 
have  something  to  show  for  their  efforts. 

The  Office  of  the  Dean  of  Students  has 
developed  the  Co-Curricular  Transcript, 
which  is  similar  to  the  students'  academic 
transcript  but  lists  activities  and  accomplish- 
ments relative  to  their  college  experience. 

"I  gathered  information  on  co-curricular 
transcripts  from  other  colleges  and  looked  at 
what  would  work  best  here,"  said  Bryan 
Hartman,  director  of  service  learning  and 
leadership.  "Our  program  mimics  much  of 
what  they're  doing  at  University  of  Buffalo. 
Theirs  seemed  to  best  fit  our  needs.1' 

Hartman  said  the  transcripts,  new  this 
fall,  will  enhance  a  student's  resume  and 
academic  transcript  and  are  presented  as 
official  documents  of  the  college. 

"The  project  is  in  its  infancy  stages,  hut 
we've  seen  some  interest  already  and  it's 
exciting,"  he  said. 

Students  who  want  to  start  a  transcript 
need  to  fill  out  a  co-curricular  transcript 
activity  report  form  for  each  activity  they 
want  included.  Types  of  activities  include 
leadership,  paraprofessional  work,  commu- 
nity involvement,  campus  organizational  and 
professional  or  educational  development. 
Honors,  awards  or  special  recognition  are 
also  noted. 

Transcript  report  forms  must  be  verified 
by  someone  involved  in  the  program  or  ac- 


tivity other  than  the  student  applicant.  For 
instance,  activity  in  the  Student  Association 
could  be  verified  by  the  SA  president.  The 
finished  transcript  will  be  printed  on  bond 
paper  with  the  college's  raised  seal  and  be 
accompanied  by  a  letter  from  Dean  of  Stu- 
dents William  Laundry. 

"Students  who  consider  a  co-curricular 
transcript  have  to  think  about  what  they're 
doing,  what  they're  getting  out  of  it  and 
hopefully  see  how  their  activity  directs  them 
to  other  experiences,"  Hartman  said. 

The  transcripts  can  be  helpful  to  students 
in  the  job  market  or  those  applying  for  gradu- 
ate work.  Working  copies  or  those  to  be 
placed  on  file  with  the  Career  Life  Planning 
office  will  be  available  to  students  for  $1; 
official  copies  to  be  mailed  to  employers  or 
graduate  schools  are  available  for  $3.  Those 
funds  will  be  turned  back  over  to  educational 
programs  such  as  Alternative  Spring  Break 
and  Omicron  Delta  Kappa,  the  national  honor 
society,  which  is  a  co-sponsor  of  the  tran- 
script program. 

Activities  must  be  related  to  students' 
college  experience.  It's  not  the  place  to  list 
summer  employment  unless  that  employ- 
ment was  an  internship  or  co-op  job,  Hartman 
said.

lar Transcript  program,  contact  Hartman  at

age  was  12  years  ago.  Since  then,  the  ship 
has  traversed  the  world's  oceans  collecting 
sediment  and  rock  samples,  recording  geo- 
physical and  geochemical  information  and 
establishing  long-term  observatories. 

Information  gleamed  from  JOIDES  Reso- 
lution explorations  will  be  studied  over  the 
years,  Adams  said.  Scientists  on  Adams' 
trek  hail  from  the  United  States,  Germany, 
Japan,  Sweden,  France,  Netherlands,  Tai- 
wan, United  Kingdom  and  Canada. 

"In  the  past  25  years  the  Ocean  Drilling 
Program  has  collected  more  than  88  miles  of 
sediment  cores  that  are  archived  for  future 
generations  of  geoscientists,"  Adams  said. 
"As  theories  change,  these  cores  can  be  re- 
examined to  test  new  ideas  about  earth  his- 
tory and  the  evaluation  of  our  planet." 


Long  Wins  SUNYACs 

(Continued from  Page  1) 

"It  was  the  greatest  feeling  after  crossing 
the  finish  line  to  look  back  and  see  my  other 
team  mates  coming  up  close  behind  me," 
said  Long. 

Long,  Davidson,  Drake  and  Drowne 
earned  All-SUNYAC  honors  to  bring  the 
total  number  of  All-SUNYAC  runners  at 
Plattsburgh  to  28.  This  marks  only  the  sec- 
ond time  in  conference  history  one  team  has 
had  four  runners  win  All-SUNYAC  honors. 
In  addition,  Long  and  Davidson  gained 
SUNYAC  Hall  of  Fame  recognition  for  plac- 
ing in  the  top  five.  They  become  the  14th 
and  15th  Cardinal  runners  inducted  into  the 
SUNYAC  Hall  of  Fame. 

Long  joins  other  past  individual  champi- 
ons from  Plattsburgh  State  including  Cardi- 
nal Sports  Hall  of  Fame  inductee  Bruce 
Teague  ('74,  '75),  Bob  Russell  ('79)  and  Jer- 
emy Burt  ('96).  Long  said  Burt,  whom  he 
used  to  run  with  last  year,  "was  really  a  big 
inspiration  for  me.  I  think  it's  great  I  can  be 
compared  to  him  and  have  comparable  run- 
ning times  like  his." 

The  Plattsburgh  State  men's  cross  coun- 
try team  is  idle  this  week  as  they  prepare  for 
the  ECACs  which  will  be  held  at  Westfield 
State  (MA)  on  Saturday,  Nov.  7.  The  men 
are  also  preparing  for  the  NCAA  Regional 
in  Saratoga  Nov.  15,  and  the  NCAA  Nation- 
als, which  will  be  held  Nov.  22  in  Boston.

Award-Winning  Author  Ronald  Takaki  to  Speak  Nov.  10 


Award-winning  author  Ronald  Takaki  will  speak  at 
Plattsburgh  State  University  of  New  York  on  Monday, 
Nov.  10,  at  8  p.m.  in  the  Warren  Ballrooms  of  the  Angell 
College  Center  as  part  of  the  President's  Speaker  Series. 

The  grandson  of  Japanese  plantation  laborers  in  Hawaii 
and  a  professor  of  ethnic  studies  at  the  University  of 
California  at  Berkeley,  Takaki  has  taken  on  the  role  of 
spokesperson  for  multicultural  education.  His  1993  book, 
A  Different  Mirror:  A  History  of  Multicultural  America,  is 
a  study,  of  America  from  the  founding  of  Jamestown  in 
1607  to  the  end  of  the  Cold  War  in  the  1990s.  His  study 
analyzes  comparatively  the  experiences  of  African  Ameri- 
cans, Asian  Americans,  Chicanos,  and  Native  Americans 
as  well  as  English,  Irish,  and  Jewish  Americans. 

In  his  lectures,  Takaki  demonstrates  that 
multiculturalism  is  not  only  an  unquestionably  accurate 
assessment  of  social  reality,  but  also  an  intellectually 
stimulating  approach  to  an  array  of  academic  disciplines. 
He  has  lectured  throughout  Russia,  Europe  and  Asia  on 
ethnicity  and  racial  conflicts. 

His  appearance  is  made  possible  through  the  President's  Speak- 
ers Series,  which  is  sponsored  by  the  offices  of  the  presidents  of 


Takaki 


Plattsburgh  State  and  the  Student  Association,  and  the  College 
Auxiliary  Services.  Takaki' s  speech  is  free  and  open  to  the  public. 


Four  Grant  Proposals  to  Receive  Funding 


The  SUNY  Research  Foundation  has 
announced  the  funding  of  several  grant 
applications  for  faculty  and  staff  projects 
totaling  more  than  $36,000. 

Two  $1,839  grants  were  awarded  to 
Feinberg  Library,  one  by  the  New  York 
State  Library  Division  of  Library  De- 
velopment and  the  other  by  New  York 
State  Education  Department,  to  be  used 
for  environmental  monitoring  and  con- 
trols in  the  library's  Special  Collections. 
The  funds  will  be  used  to  assist  in  im- 
proving and  monitoring  the  environ- 
mental conditions  where  Feinberg's  ar- 
chival collection  is  housed. 

In  particular,  the  library  needed  funds 
to  purchase  UV  filtering  sleeves  for  the 
standard  fluorescent  lamps  installed  in 
the  main  collection  area.  In  addition, 
funds  will  be  used  to  purchase  tempera- 
ture monitoring  instruments.  Electronic 
measuring  and  recording  devices  offer 
advantages  over  conventional  methods. 

A  $7,500  grant  was  awarded  to  the 
Center  for  Earth  and  Environmental 
Science  Department  for  Dr.  David 
Franzi's  work  in  compiling  watershed 
information  and  assessment  of  nonpoint 
source  pollution  in  a  Geographic  Infor- 
mation System  database  for  the  Little 


Chazy  River  watershed.  The  database 
will  provide  baseline  information  for 
resource  managers  and  planners  to  iden- 
tify potential  sources  of  nonpoint  source 
pollutants  and  to  aid  in  evaluating  the 
impact  of  nonpoint  pollution  on  water 
quality  in  the  watershed  and  Lake 
Champlain.  Funds  for  Franzi's  work 
were  made  available  through  the  Clinton 
County  Planning  Department 

The  Bell  Atlantic  Foundation  granted 
the  Center  for  Educational  Studies  and 
Services,  in  collaboration  with  the  North 
Country  Teacher  Resource  Center,  a 
$25,000  grant  to  provide  intensive  train- 
ing in  technology  utilization,  especially 
telecommunications,  for  students  en- 
rolled in  the  professional  semester  and 
in  student  teaching. 

Last  year,  the  Center  and  NCTRC 
provided  telecommunications  training 
for  secondary  education  p re-service 
teachers  and  their  cooperating  in-ser- 
vice teachers  in  a  pilot  project  during 
the  professional  semester.  This  funding 
allows  expansion  of  that  program  and 
takes  the  project  to  the  next  step,  pro- 
viding additional  training  activities  dur- 
ing the  student  teaching  semester  that 
follows  the  professional  semester. 


Soul'd  Out  II  Concert 
to  Benefit  Child  Abuse 
Prevention  Program 


Faculty,  staff  and  students  will  have  the 
chance  to  bare  their  souls  at  a  variety  show 
to  raise  funds  for  the  Plattsburgh  Child  Abuse 
Prevention  Program. 

"Soul'd  Out  II,"  sponsored  by  the  School 
of  Business  and  Economics  and  Sigma  Delta 
Tau  and  coordinated  by  Drs.  James  Csipak 
and  Kevin  O'Neill,  begins  at  6:30  p.m.  in 
the  Warren  Ballrooms  Thursday,  Nov.  13. 

"We're  looking  for  anyone  on  campus 
interested  in  performing,"  said  Csipak.  "Po- 
etry reading,  juggling,  piano,  comedy  skits 
â€”  anything  that's  decent  and  legal  we're

Xylophone  Symbol'  of  Thai  Village 

Adams  Donate  Musical  Instrument  to  Music  Program 


The  hand-made  wooden  xylophone  Ken 
Adams  recently  donated  to  the  music  pro- 
gram at  Plattsburgh  State  was  more  than  a 
souvenir.  "It  was  a  symbol  of  the  good  days 
in  Tha-U-Then,  a  small  village  on  the 
Mekong  River,1'  said  Adams. 

A  professor  in  the  Center  for  Earth  and 
Environmental  Science,  Adams  was  an  Air 
Force  sergeant  stationed  at  Nakhon  Phanom 
Royal  Thai  Air  Base  in  the  early  1970s.  His 
intelligence  unit  was  responsible  for  moni- 
toring the  movement  of  North  Vietnamese 
troops  and  supplies  on  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  trails 
in  Laos  and  Cambodia.  The  information  was 
used  to  determine  "real  time"  and  strategic 
bombing  targets. 

During  his  time  off,  Adams  said,  "four  of 
us  would  visit  the  school  in  Tha-U-Then  and 
meet  with  the  teachers  and  children.  The 
villagers  had  so  little  in  terms  of  material 
things  but  they  were  rich  in  human  spirit." 

"Thai  children  have  the  greatest  smiles  in 
the  world,"  remembered  Adams. 

In  one  of  his  visits  to  the  village,  he 


received  the  wooden  xylo- 
phone as  a  gift.  And,  even 
though  Adams  does  not  play 
the  instrument,  he  has  held 
onto  the  "conversation  piece" 
for  the  past  25  years. 

"I  learned  about  Buddha, 
Thai  music,  and  that  point- 
ing your  foot  at  someone  is 
an  impolite  gesture,"  Adams 
said  of  his  visits  with  the 
local  Thai  people.  "We 
gained  a  greater  understand- 
ing of  each  other's  cultures 
and  customs." 

The  xylophone  is  now  in  Drs>  Ken  Adams  and  Marshall  Onofrio  exam  the  hand-made  Thai 
the  hands  of  Dr.  Marshall  wooden  xylophone  Adams  recently  donated  to  the  Music  Program  at 
Onofrio,  coordinator  of  the  thecol,ege- 


music  program.  Onofrio  said  he  has  plans  for 
the  musical  instrument  that  is  kept  in  a  secure 
and  humidity-controlled  room. 

"I'm  sure  that  the  xylophone  will  be  a 
great  addition  to  our  World  Music  and  Acous- 
tics courses,"  said  Onofrio.  "The  Percussion 


"Roof-A-Thon"  Nets  Fraternity  $1,700  to 
Improve  Handicapped  Accessibility 


Members  of  Pi  Kappa  Phi  waved  to  shoppers  as  the  fraternity  brothers  spent  two  chilly  nights  on  the  roof 
of  Wal-Mart  to  raise  funds  for  PUSH  America. 

The  Pi  Kappa  Phi  Fraternity  at  Plattsburgh  State  University  recently  held  its  annual 
"Roof-A-Thon"  on  top  of  Wal-Mart  in  Plattsburgh. 

Fraternity  members  camped  out  on  the  large  department  store's  roof  through  the 
weekend,  while  other  members  sold  raffle  tickets  below.  A  portion  of  the  more  than  $1,700 
raised  during  the  weekend  will  be  donated  to  the  North  Country  Center  for  Independence 
through  the  fraternity's  national  philanthropy,  PUSH  America.  PUSH  America  serves 
people  with  disabilities.  NCCI  will  use  these  funds  to  advance  their  effort  to  improve 
accessibility  for  people  with  disabilities  in  the  North  Country. 

The  members  of  Pi  Kappa  Phi  will  also  devote  a  portion  of  their  community  service  efforts 
to  the  North  Country  Center  through  other  future  local  projects  to  improve  accessibility  for 
people  with  disabilities. 


Ensemble  may  have  occasion  to  include  it  in 
their  performances  as  well." 

He  also  said  that  the  wooden  instrument, 
which  produces  different  musical  pitches, 
will  be  tested  for  comparison  to  the  tradi- 
tional western  scale.

Merrens,  Brannigan  Put  Personality  into  Textbook 


Drs.  Matthew  Merrens  and  Gary 
Brannigan  have  injected  some  personal- 
ity into  a  text  about  personality. 

The  two  psychology  professors  have 
written  Experiences  in  Personality:  Re- 
search,  Assessment,  and  Cliange,  a  work- 
book-like text  designed  to  supplement  the 
more  traditional,  and  often  staid,  person- 
ality textbooks. 

Arranged  with  a  combination  of  read- 
ings, culled  from  various  sources,  hands- 
on  learning  exercises  and  a  feature  called 
"Spotlight,"  in  which  research  projects 
and  studies  are  highlighted  and  profiled, 
the  book  covers  standard  topics  in  per- 


Merrens  Brannigan 


sonality  in  an  engaging  way. 

"You  Know  What  They  Say ..."  is  a  read- 
ing about  proverbs  and  their  validity  â€”  or 
lack  thereof â€” in  life.  "Fortune  Tellers  Never 


Starve"  discusses  the  ever-popular  use  of 
psychics  in  today's  society,  and  "What  I 
Meant  to  Say"  takes  a  wry  look  at  the 
Freudian  slip  of  the  tongue. 

"AH  too  often  traditional  texts  present 
materials  in  a  dry,  static  manner," 
Merrens  and  Brannigan  write  in  their 
introduction.  They  should  know  what 
they're  talking  about  The  pair  have  had 
to  use  those  traditional  texts  in  their  own 
classrooms. 

"It  is  our  belief  that  this  book  will 
provide  a  more  favorable  learning  cli- 
mate that  will  enable  (students)  to  engage 
with  the  topics  more  successfully."

Plattsburgh 

STATE  UNIVERSITY  OF  NEW  YORK 


PUBLISHED  BY  COLLEGE  RELATIONS  AND  DEVELOPMENT  FOR  THE  COLLEGE  COMMUNITY  â€¢  November  13,  1997 


Plattsburgh  State  Wins 
Two  Alumni  Awards 

The  Office  of  College  Relations  and 
Development  will  receive  top  honors 
in  two  of  five  categories  in  the  1997 
Awards  for  Excellence  in  Alumni  De- 
velopment and  Programming  by  the 
SUNY  Confederation  of  Alumni  As- 
sociations. 

The  Plattsburgh  State  Alumni  Leg- 
islative Network  received  top  honors 
for  the  second  year  in  a  row  in  the 
Advocacy  Programs  category.  The 
College  was  also  named  winner  in  the 
Undergraduate  and  Recruitment  Pro- 
grams category  for  the  special  early 
spring  issue  of  Plattsburgh  Today, 
which  was  developed  specifically  for 
prospective  students  whom  Admissions 
had  accepted  but  at  that  point  had  not 
accepted  Plattsburgh  State. 

The  legislative  network  matches 
key  Plattsburgh  State  alumni  with  leg- 
islative leaders  and  with  those  state 
law-makers  who  serve  on  key  legisla- 
tive committees.  Alumni  communi- 
cated their  concerns  about  the  proposed 
$124  million  shortfall  in  SUNY's  fis- 
cal year  1997-98  proposed  operating 
budget. 

Several  new  initiatives  took  place, 
including  the  first  "Legislative  Leader- 
ship Forum/*  held  in  February  and 
hosted  by  President  Judson  for  Senator 
Ronald  B .  Stafford  and  Assemlypersons 
Chris  Ortloff  and  Elizabeth  Little.  Also 
attending  the  Forum  were  members  of 
the  administrative  staff,  union  leaders 
and  several  representatives  of  the  stu- 
dent government. 

Also  in  February,  a  meeting  was 
held  between  President  Judson  and 
members  of  the  Press  Republican  edi-

Student  Support  Services  Keeps 
Sailing  With  $1.2  Million  Grant 


Student  Support  Services  will  continue  to 
thrive  at  Plattsburgh  State  well  past  the  year 
2000  thanks  to  renewal  of  a  grant  that  will 
exceed  $1  million. 

Michele  Little,  director  of  the  program, 
said  the  federally  funded  U.S.  Department  of 
Education  grant  has  garnered  $333,091  for 
the  1997-98  budget  year  and  will  increase  by 
two  percent  each  year  thereafter  until  2001, 
bringing  in  about  $1.2  million. 

"Student  Support  Services  is  designed  to 
get  people  through  the  academic  pipeline," 
Little  said.  "We're  the  baccalaureate  com- 
ponent; Upward  Bound  is  the  high-school 
component." 

Students  who  qualify  for  the  program 
must  meet  at  least  one  of  three  criteria:  they 
are  disabled  in  some  way;  neither  parent 
went  to  college;  or  they  meet  income  guide- 
lines. 

"The  income  guideline  is  based  on  net 
taxable  income,"  Little  said.  The  three  areas 
are  broad  enough  that  "nearly  half  of  the 
students  here  would  qualify,"  she  said.  "But 
we  let  the  students  decide  if  they  want  the 
services." 

As  a  result.  Student  Support  Services  helps 
between  500  and  600  students  a  year  in  one 
capacity  or  another,  she  said. 

"We  teach  courses  in  math,  English,  sci- 
ence, reading  â€”  they're  regular  classes  that 
students  would  take  anywhere  on  campus. 
It' s  just  that  we  can  offer  smaller  classes  with 
tutorial  support." 

Students  who  receive  support  from  the 
program  are  regular  admissions  to  the  col- 
lege. 

"They  find  us.  usually  through  word  of 
mouth  or  referrals  from  faculty  who  see  a 
struggling  student,"  Little  said.  "If  one  stu- 
dent has  a  good  experience,  very  often  he'll 
bring  in  five  of  his  friends.  We're  very  stu-

port Services  Center. 

dent-oriented.  They're  in  there  all  the  time." 

The  fact  that  the  center,  located  in  the 
Angell  College  Center,  is  open  until  8  p.m. 
can't  hurt.  Students  find  walk-in  help  in 
math,  writing,  science,  "just  about  anything 
they're  struggling  with,"  Little  said.  "Some- 
times they  come  in  just  to  work  on  a  paper  or 
use  the  computers.  Sometimes  they  come  in 
just  to  talk,  to  unload." 

In  addition  to  academics,  the  center 
handles  all  services  needed  for  students  with 
disabilities. 

"There  are  more  than  500  students  who 
have  declared  themselves  as  disabled  and 
can  be  eligible  for  services.  We  see  a  core 
group  of  300  on  a  regular  basis,"  she  said. 

The  program  has  been  in  continual  opera- 
tion on  campus  since  1 978.  Funding  secured 
for  the  program  pays  the  salaries  of  staff  and 
buys  supplies  to  keep  the  staff  on  board  to 
run  the  program.  Little  said. 

"We  see  about  10  percent  of  the  student 
population,  but  we  know  there  are  many, 
many  more  students  out  there  who  haven't 
linked  up  with  our  services,"  she  said.  "We'd 
like  to  connect  with  them."

Cohen 's  Book  Examines  Cultural 
Blindspots  Leading  to  Racism 


Cohen 


Racism  is  get- 
ting in  the  way  of 
solving  our  real 
problems,  says 
Dr.  Mark  Cohen 
in  his  new  book, 
"Culture  of  Intol- 
erance: Chauvin- 
ism. Class  and 
Racism  in  the 
United  States." 

The  Plattsburgh  State  distinguished 
teaching  professor  of  anthropology  main- 
tains that  the  real  problems  "stem  from 
some  arbitrary  and  inappropriate  assump- 
tions of  American  culture. 

"There  are  no  races  and  never  have 
been,"  Cohen  said.  "A  black  and  a  white 
are  in  fact  likely  to  be  as  similar  to  one 
another  biologically  as  each  is  to  members 
of  'his  own'  group.  This  is  because  color 
accounts  for  only  six  or  so  pairs  of  genes 
out  of  20,000  pairs  of  genes  that  produce 
human  differences." 

Our  problems,  Cohen  says,  are  about 
culture. 

"Culture  is  more  than  song  and  dance;  it 
is  a  whole  set  of  unspoken  rules  that  govern 
our  thought  and  behavior  as  much  as  the 
grammar  of  language  governs  our  speech," 
he  said.  "Each  group  has  its  own  arbitrary 
culture  just  as  it  has  its  own  arbitrary  lan- 
guage. Learning  another  culture  is  hard, 
just  as  learning  another  language  is,  espe- 
cially if  one  is  an  adult.  Until  you  are 
exposed  to  another  culture  it  is  hard  to 
imagine  that  different  people  have  differ- 
ent cultures  â€” just  as  if  English  were  the 
only  language  we  knew,  it  would  seem  like 
the  only,  obvious,  natural  human  language." 


Cohen  maintains  our  inability  to  un- 
derstand these  cultural  differences  has 
three  results. 

"First,  we  don't  understand  what  other 
people  are  doing  and  why,  so  we  see  only 
primitive  failure,"  he  said.  "For  example, 
an  African  witch  doctor  is  actually  doing 
things  that  our  doctors  are  now  starting  to 
emulate  â€”  but  for  years  we  dismissed 
them  as  crackpots. 

"Second,  we  don' t  understand  how  im- 
portant cultural  barriers  are  to  perfor- 
mance in  our  own  culture  by  immigrants 
and/or  minority  groups,"  he  said. 

Cohen  said  that  society  presumes  these 
people  are  "ignorant  or  dumb  when  in  fact 
they  just  haven't  learned  our  arbitrary 
rules.  IQ  tests  are  an  obvious  example  of 
this.  They  aren't  about  logical  ability; 
they  are  about  knowing  our  logical  rules." 

The  third  result  is  that  we  have  no 
perspective  on  the  arbitrary  nature  of  our 
own  cultural  assumptions  that  generate 
our  problems. 

"American  perception  of  freedom,  of 
the  individual,  of  property,  profit,  law  and 
justice  are  arbitrary,"  Cohen  said.  "We 
have  some  blind  spots  obvious  to  people 
from  other  cultures  â€”  like  the  degree  to 
which  the  community,  not  the  individual 
conditions  both  success  and  failure.  Those 
blindspots  generate  the  economic  pres- 
sures that  get  translated  into  racism,  al- 
though race  is  the  wrong  target." 

Cohen  addressed  the  issues  he  raises  in 
his  book  at  a  presentation,  "Why  Every- 
one Needs  to  End  Racism"  Nov.  1 2  on  the 
eve  of  the  college's  Dialogues  fof  Diver- 
sity workshops. 


Dialogues  For  Diversity  Workshops  Today,  Friday 

The  President's  Advisory  Committee  on  Diversity  is  sponsoring  three  diver- 
sity workshops  today  and  tomorrow.  The  Dialogues  for  Diversity  workshops

Arnold  Amell  '53,  College  Council  Member,  Elected  ACT  President 


Amell 


Arnold  Amell  of 
Scotia,  a  1953 
graduate  of  Pitts- 
burgh State  and  a 
member  of  the  Col- 
lege Council,  has 
been  elected  presi- 
dent of  the  Associa- 
tion  of  Council 
Members  and  Col- 
lege Trustees  of  the 
State  University  of  New  York  (ACT). 

Amell  is  a  retired  assistant  superintendent 
for  personnel  and  management  with  the 
Schenectady  City  School  District.  An  active 
supporter  of  Plattsburgh  State  and  the  alumni 
association  for  many  years,  he  is  a  past 
president  of  the  Alumni  Association  and 
conti  nues  to  serve  it' s  board  of  directors. .  He 
was  appointed  by  former  Governor  Mario 
Cuomo  to  the  Plattsburgh  State  College 
Council  in  1989. 

Amell  said  ACT  is  particularly  concerned 
about  the  new  SUNY  selection  criteria  for 
campus  presidents.  College  councils  are  now 
required  to  submit  the  names  of  the  three  top 
finalists  for  a  campus  presidency  to  the  SUNY 
Board  of  Trustees  who  will  then  make  the 
final  selection.  Amell  also  said  council  mem- 
bers are  disturbed  by  the  trustees'  demand 
requiring  the  hiring  of  an  outside  consultant 


to  assist  colleges  in  the  presidential  search 
process. 

ACT,  which  supports  the  campus  coun- 
cils in  their  efforts  to  contribute  to  the  suc- 
cess of  the  University,  is  an  advocate  for  the 
campuses  individually  and  collectively. 

Amell  will  also  attend  SUNY  trustees 
meeting  as  the  representative  of  ACT. 


He  is  not  the  first  Plattsburgh  State  Col- 
lege Council  member  to  lead  ACT.  Robert 
Garrow  '52,  current  chair  of  the  College 
Council,  is  a  past  president  of  the  statewide 
organization. 

Jacqueline  Walker  of  Plattsburgh,  also  a 
member  of  the  Plattsburgh  State  College 
Council,  sits  on  the  ACT  Board  of  Directors. 


President  Search  Process,  Residence  Hall  Fire 
Top  College  Council's  Nov.  20  Meeting  Agenda 


Changes  in  the  search  process  for  new 
SUNY  campus  presidents  and  the  response 
to  the  fire  in  Macdonough  Residence  Hall 
will  be  on  the  agenda  at  the  next  meeting  of 
the  Plattsburgh  State  College  Council  on 
Thursday,  Nov.  20,  at  4  p.m.  in  the  Confer- 
ence Room  of  Memorial  Hall. 

The  College  Council  will  discuss  changes 
in  the  selection  process  for  a  campus  presi- 
dent. SUNY  college  councils  are  now  re- 
quired to  submit  the  names  of  the  three  top 
finalists  for  a  campus  presidency  to  the 
SUNY  Board  of  Trustees  who  will  then  make 
the  final  selection.  They  are  also  required  to 
hire  an  outside  consultant  to  assist  colleges 
in  the  presidential  search  process. 

Council  members  will  also  hear  a  report 
on  the  status  of  the  early  morning  fire  Oct.  4

ternational Business  Education  Research  and  Training,  the  North  Country  World 
Trade  Council  and  the  Plattsburgh-North  Country  Chamber  of  Commerce, 
introduced  a  new  cooperative  effort  to  expand  business  efforts  at  the  same  time  in 
Poland  and  New  York  State.  The  Polish  officials  also  met  with  representatives 
from  the  Empire  State  Development,  New  York  State  Department  of  Labor, 
PARC,  Plattsburgh  City  Development  Office,  and  Bombardier  Corporation.  Due 
to  the  success  of  the  workshop,  the  trade  council  will  be  bringing  in  other  trade

High  School  Students 
Focus  Of  Summit  at 
Plattsburgh  State 

Plattsburgh  State  will  play  host  to  Clinton 
County's  Summit  for  Youth  this  weekend  as 
approximately  30  high  school  students  and 
45  adults,  including  parents  and  representa- 
tives of  schools,  non-profit  agencies  and 
governments,  gather  to  discuss  issues  affect- 
ing the  future  of  today's  youth. 

Bryan  Hartman,  director  of  service  learn- 
ing and  leadership  and  one  of  the  summit 
coordinators,  said  Clinton  County  needs  to 
address  issues  confronting  youths  daily. 

"Our  task  is  to  recruit  a  volunteer  of  men 
and  women,  community-based  organizations 
and  corporations,  to  provide  our  young 
people  with  the  fundamental  resources  that 
are  necessary  to  maximize  their  potential, 
live  the  American  dream,  and  give  back  to 
society  in  meaningful  ways,"  said  Hartman. 

Members  of  Omicron  Delta  Kappa  will 
play  host  to  the  youth  participants  through- 
out their  entire  stay  on  campus. 


Within  One  Year  After  Graduating  From  Plattsburgh 

More  Alumni  Pursuing  Advanced  Degrees 


More  and  more  Plattsburgh  State  alumni 
each  year  are  pursuing  advanced  degrees  im- 
mediately after  graduation  from  Plattsburgh 
.In  the  most  recent  survey  of  the  Class  of 
1996,  18.5  percent  of  those  responding  said 
they  were  furthering  their  education  full- 
time.  That's  in  comparison  to  15.2  percent 
f  or  the  Class  of  1995  a  year  ago  and  12.6 
percent  for  the  Class  of  1990. 


year  to  the  next.  Smallman  said  74  percent  of 
the  Class  of  1996  surveyed  were  employed 
on  a  full-time  basis  and  another  13.7  percent 
were  in  part-time  jobs.  Except  for  the  Classes 
of  1 992  and  1 993  when  the  rates  dipped  to  70 
percent,  the  percentage  of  recent  graduates 
continued  to  remain  around  75  percent. 


said  they  were  satisfied  with  their  coursework 
at  Plattsburgh  State,  and  alumni  believe  that 
their  internships,  cooperative  work  experi- 
ences, summer  and  part-time  jobs,  and  extra- 
curricular activities  during  college  played  a 
role  in  their  efforts  to  obtain  employment. 
"Many  employers  are  seeking  educated, 


well-rounded  individuals,"  said 
"Our    graduates  get  a  good  Solid    Smallman.  "When  it  gets  down  to  ex- 


Dr.  Ed  Smallman,  director  of  the  Ca-  foundation  here  and  then  are  able  tO  gO    Perience,  our  graduates  who  have  com- 


reer  Services  Center,  said  the  survey 
suggests  that  Plattsburgh  State  is  prepar- 
ing students  to  meet  the  necessary  quali- 
fications for  entry  to  graduate  school. 

"The  value  of  the  college  degree  is  not 
what  it  used  to  be  25  years  ago.  The  need  for 
advanced  degrees  for  entry  level  positions  is 
reflective  of  the  economy,"  said  Smallman. 
"Our  graduates  get  a  good  solid  foundation 
here  and  then  are  able  to  go  on  to  graduate 
schools  and  achieve  success." 

In  comparison,  the  percentage  of  alumni 
pursuing  advanced  degrees  on  a  part-time 
basis  one  year  out  of  college  continues  to 
decrease.  For  instance,  23.5  percent  of  the 
respondents  of  the  Class  of  1 99 1  were  taki  ng 
graduate  courses  on  a  part-time  basis  while 
the  number  of  alumni  from  the  Class  of  1 996 
has  decreased  to  16.1  percent. 

The  percentage  of  recent  graduates  going 
into  the  work  force  right  out  of  Plattsburgh 
State  continues  to  be  consistent  from  one 


on  to  graduate  schools  and  achieve 
success.  "       â€”  Dr.  Ed  Smallman,  Director 
Career  Services  Center 


Graduates  are  also  obtaining  competitive 
full-time  entry-level  salaries  averaging  be- 
tween $25,900  and  $29,800. 

"Entry-level  salaries  reflect  the  economy's 
continued  growth  and  there  are  employment 
opportunities  out  there,"  said  Smallman. 

"As  employers  do  more  hiring,  salaries 
need  to  be  more  competitive  to  lure  appli- 
cants their  way.  It's  the  old  supply  and  de- 
mand curve." 

That  supply  and  demand  in  the  economy 
still  continues  to  haunt  women  whose  sala- 
ries continue  to  lag  behind  those  of  their  male 
counterparts.  While  the  average  entry-level 
salary  for  men  is  $29,855,  the  average  salary 
for  women  amounts  to  $25,939.

New  Entrance  Sign  Nears  Completion 


Construction  on  the  new  main  entrance  sign  to  Plattsburgh  State  at  the  intersection  of 
Draper  and  Broad  streets  continues  to  progress  smoothly  as  workers  attach  Lake 
Placid  Blue  Granite  to  the  concrete  wall.  When  completed  this  fall,  the  wall  will  bear 
the  college's  name  in  12-inch  high  lettering  and  a  36-inch  diameter  casting  of  the  logo 
made  of  bronze.  The  new  sign,  which  is  just  the  first  part  of  a  project  to  improve  the 
open  space  area  near  Ward  Hall,  will  be  illuminated  at  night.

pleted  internships  or  worked  during 
college  now  have  adiscriminating  fac- 
tor that  put  them  ahead  of  others." 

For  the  most  part  there  were  no 
major  differences  in  the  survey  results 
from  past  samplings  of  the  al  umni.  Smallman 
said,  "In  general,  these  results  demonstrate 
that  our  students  are  doing  well  and  each 
year  they  are  doing  a  little  bit  better  than  the 
year  before." 

He  said  he  was  pleased  with  the  continued 
high  percentage  of  alumni  responding  to  the 
survey  on  an  annual  basis  even  though  this 
was  the  lowest  response  rate  during  the  de- 
cade. "Ten  to  15  percent  return  is  considered 
good,  but  42  percent  is  a  phenomenally  high 
rate." 

Five  hundred  and  eighty-three  surveys 
were  received  from  1,388  alumni  of  the 
Class  of  1996  who  were  sent  the  question- 
naires.

Dr.  Allen  S.  Everest,  Former  History  Department  Chair,  Dead  at  84 


Everest 


Dr.  Allen  S. 
Everest,  professor 
emeritus  and 
former  chair  of  the 
history  department 
at  Plattsburgh  State, 
died  Monday,  Nov. 
3,  1997,  at  the  age 
of  84. 

Everest  is  re- 
garded as  one  of  the 
premier  historians  of  his  generation  and  an 
authority  on  the  history  of  Northern  New 
York. 

Born  Oct.  9,  1913  in  South  Shaftsbury, 
Vt.,  Everest  grew  up  in  New  Haven,  Vt.  and 
attended  Beeman  Academy. 

He  received  a  bachelor's  degree  from  the 
University  of  Vermont  in  1 936  and  a  master' s 
from  Teachers  College  at  Columbia  Univer- 
sity in  1 937.  After  enlisting  in  the  U.S.  Army 
Air  Force  during  World  War  II,  Everest 
earned  his  doctorate  from  Columbia  Univer- 
sity in  1948. 

Everest  joined  the  faculty  of  Plattsburgh 
State  University  of  New  York  in  September 

'Great  American 
Smokeout '  Returns 
To  Campus  Nov.  20 

The  Wellness  Center  will  be  sponsoring 
Plattsburgh  State's  "Great  American 
Smokeout,"  Thursday,  Nov.  20. 

Faculty,  staff  and  students  can  find  pledge 
cards  around  campus  at  the  Wellness  Center, 
College  Center  Desk,  Counseling  Center, 
Student  Health  Center,  dining  halls,  and  the 
Personnel  Office  in  the  Kehoe  Administra- 
tion Building. 

If  you're  a  smoker,  take  the  pledge  and 
quit  for  the  day.  If  you  don't  smoke,  support 
a  friend  who  is  trying  to  quit. 


Advocates  of  the  campaign  say: 

â€¢  More  than  400,000  deaths  in  the 
U.S.  each  year  are  due  to  smoking- 
related  illnesses. 

â€¢  Quitting  smoking  decreases  the 
risk  of  lung  cancer,  heart  disease, 
stroke,  lung  diseases,  and  other  can- 
cers. 

â€¢  Smoking  harms  not  only  the 
smoker,  but  others  who  breathe  the 
second-hand  smoke. 


1947.  He  taught  courses  in  history  about 
New  York  State,  the  North  Country,  Colo- 
nial times  and  the  American  Revolution,  as 
well  as  introductory  courses  during  his  more 
than  35  years  as  a  teacher  at  the  College. 

He  chaired  the  committee  that  produced 
the  first  Faculty  Senate  by-laws  from  1965 
to  1 967  and  was  elected  the  first  chair  of  the 
Faculty  Senate,  from  1967  to  1969. 

He  chaired  the  History  Department  from 
1971  to  1974  and  was  a  founding  member 
of  the  Special  Collections  unit  in  Feinberg 
Library.  He  retired  in  July  1983. 

During  his  tenure  at  Plattsburgh  State  and 
even  after  his  retirement,  Everest  authored 
many  articles,  books  and  publications  about 
Northern  New  York. 

Horace  Judson,  president  of  Plattsburgh 
State,  said,  "We  are  saddened  to  hear  of  the 
death  of  Professor  Everest.  While  I  did  not 
know  him  personally,  V  ve  learned  that  from 
the  day  he  arrived  on  this  campus  in  Septem- 
ber 1947  until  his  retirement  in  1983,  he  was 
a  steadfast  proponent  of  the  preservation  of 
our  heritage.  He  was  one  of  the  foremost 
authorities  on  the  history  of  Northern  New 


York  and  was  one  of  the  original  founders  of 
our  Special  Collections  in  Feinberg  Library. 
He  will  be  sadly  missed." 

John  Myers,  professor  of  history  and  a 
colleague  of  Everest  for  many  years,  said  hi  s 
death  is  a  loss  to  the  community. 

"American  History  and  the  North  Coun- 
try will  both  miss  Allen  Everest  who  un- 
doubtedly knew  more  about  the  history  of 
this  region  than  any  other  individual.  His 
breadth  of  research  covered  subjects  from 
the  War  of  1 8 1 2  to  prohibition  in  the  1 920s. 
He  was  always  willing  to  provide  informa- 
tion to  researchers  wanting  to  know  about 
the  North  Country  and  to  local  organizations 
who  wanted  to  hear  about  the  research  he  had 
completed,"  said  Myers. 

"The  History  Department,  for  which  he 
served  as  chair  for  a  number  years,  will  miss 
him  and  the  Faculty  Senate,  for  which  he 
served  as  the  original  chair,  will  long  be 
grateful  for  his  services." 

Everest  was  a  founding  member  of  the 
Clinton  County  Historical  Museum  and 
served  on  its  broad  for  a  number  of  years.

Chilean  Trip  Emphasizes  Global  Librarianship 


Leonard 


Feinberg  Library 
Patron  Services  Librar- 
ian Terry  Leonard  now 
wears  another  hat:  Chil- 
ean librarian  ambassa- 
dor. 

Leonard  traveled  to 
Chile  in  July  to  assist 
librarians  there  with  the 
implementation  of  the 
same  circulation  system  found  at  Feinberg. 
Her  trip  was  in  response  to  a  1 995  visit  made 
by  five  Chilean  librarians  to  Feinberg  to 
witness  the  integrated  library  system  here. 

"I  worked  with  a  group  of  librarians  who 
are  working  on  a  project  to  get  64  libraries  up 
and  running  with  this  new  system,"  Leonard 
said.  "They're  training  to  help  these  libraries 
set  up." 

In  addition,  Leonard  participated  in  a  three- 
day  workshop  for  librarians  from  other  Chil- 
ean universities.  Although  she  speaks  no 


Spanish,  Leonard  said  she  managed  to  un- 
derstand and  be  understood  in  what  could 
have  been  an  intimidating  setting. 

"It  was  a  challenge,"  said.  "We  were 
taking  a  library  system  developed  in  Montreal 
with  a  program  that  was  written  in  French 
and  having  it  installed  in  Santiago.  They 
want  the  system  limited  to  only  those  stu- 
dents using  the  material  in  each  library, 
unlike  our  philosophy,  which  is  to  make  as 
much  information  available  as  possible  to 
anyone  who  needs  it." 

Even  with  the  language  difference, 
Leonard  was  able  to  retrieve  information 
from  Plattsburgh  on  one  computer  and  send 
it  back  to  a  second  computer  in  Chile  to  show 
the  librarians  what  they  were  capable  of 
doing  on  the  new  system.  The  Chileans  could 
then  call  their  computer  technicians  in  to 
address  how  to  implement  the  features. 

"It  was  amazing,"  Leonard  said.  "I  was  in 
a  Spanish-speaking  country  using  my  En-

at  Plattsburgh  State  sort 
food  they  collected  re- 
cently during  the  group's 
fourth  annual  Hunger 
Awareness  Day.  Four- 
teen students  collected 
more  than  500  cans  and 
350  boxes  of  food  items 
from  their  friends  and 
neighbors  in  the  City  of 
Plattsburgh.  The  food 
was  given  to  the  Salva-

glish  to  teach  them  a  French-originated  pro- 
gram. Everything  was  done  on-line." 

Leonard  also  spent  four  days  with  the 
Plattsburgh  State  Latin  American  Southern 
Cone  Program  orientation  going  on  at  the 
same  time  with  Plattsburgh  State's  Dr.  Wil- 
liam Culver,  the  program  director,  and 
Carmen  Madariaga  Culver,  the  assistant  di- 
rector. 

After  the  Southern  Cone  orientation,  at- 
tended by  Plattsburgh  State  Latin  American 
studies  major  James  Gyle,  Leonard  took  part 
in  a  conference  on  library  automation  for 
directors  and  librarians  across  Chile. 

The  trip  was  paid  for  in  part  by  the  South- 
ern Cone  program  and  the  University  of 
Chile.  Leonard  made  a  presentation  at 
Feinberg  on  her  experiences  in  Chile  and 
will  give  another  presentation,  "Global 
Librarianship:  A  Chilean  Experience,"  Nov  . 
1 8  at  a  Latin  American  Studies  lunch  collo- 
quia  from  12  to  1  p.m.  in  Hawkins  107.

as  adults,  and  it  has  monthly  gallery  exhibits

Women's  Soccer  Team  Ends  Season 

The  individuals  honors  continued  to  roll  in  for  members  of  the 
Plattsburgh  State  women's  soccer  team  as  three  Cardinals  received  All- 
State  honors  last  week.  Jamie  Retersdorf  of  Gloversville,  Shanna 
Saunders  of  Rochester,  and  Keri  Honors  of  Kirkville,  were  selected  to 
the  New  York  State  Women's  Collegiate  Athletic  Association 
(NYSWCAA)  1997  All-State  Soccer  team. 

The  women's  soccer  team,  making  their  third  Eastern  Collegiate 
Athletic  Conference  appearance  in  five  years,  defeated  Skidmore  3-1 
Nov.  5  in  the  opening  round  of  the  EC  AC  Division  III  Women' s  Soccer 
Tournament  with  two  goals  by  Karen  Perotta  of  Mahopac  and  one  by  Jill 
Hubright  of  Williams.  Erin  Shaw  of  Rochester  made  one  saves  in  goal 
in  the  Cardinal  victory.  Shanna  Saunders  of  Rochester,  registered  two 
assists  in  the  game,  raising  her  season  total  to  10  assists,  a  new 
Plattsburgh  State  single  season  record.  Three  days  later  the  team  was 
unable  to  overcome  a  early  second  half  goal  by  Brockport,  falling  0-1 
to  the  Golden  Eagles  in  semifinal  action.  The  EC  AC  tournament  marked 
the  eighth  straight  post-season  showing  for  Plattsburgh  and  the  final 
collegiate  game  for  senior  Carrie  Rose  of  Waddington.  Rose,  a 
midfielder,  finished  the  season  with  two  goals  and  three  assists. 

Men's  Cross  Country  Team  Solid

fifth  out  of  45  teams.  Walter  Long  of  Smithtown,  continued  his  out- 
standing season  with  a  5th  place  finish,  covering  the  course  in  a  time  of 
25:51.  Corey  Davidson  of  Cadyville,  was  the  second  finisher  for  the

Cardinals  qualified  six  swimmers  for  the  State  University  of  New  York

Schenectady  led  the  charge  for  the  Cardinals,  winning  the  100m  fly  and 
100m  back  while  placing  third  in  the  200m  IM.  Kazmer's  time  in  the 
1 00  fly  (59.79)  was  good  enough  to  qualify  him  for  the  SUNYAC  men' s 
swimming  championships.  Another  major  contributor  to  the  Platts- 
burgh win  was  Mike  Fischetti  of  Honeoye  Falls,  who  finished  with

Cardinals  Wins  First  Two  in  SUNYAC 

The  Plattsburgh  State  men's  ice  hockey  team  opened  their  SUNYAC

On  Friday,  the  Cardinals  scored  eight  goals  in  the  third  period  to  trounce 
Buffalo  State  13-1.  Ten  different  players  scored  goals  for  Plattsburgh 
while  Steve  Moffat  of  Hatboro,  PA,  Bryan  Murray  of  Barry '  s  Bay,  Ont., 
and  Derrick  Shaw  of  Scottsdale,  AZ,  all  had  two  goals  each.  Brad 
Erbsland  of  Rye  Brook  made  20  saves  while  Dave  Martin  of  Elizabeth,

Saturday,  Plattsburgh  survived  a  third-period  scare  by  Fredonia  to 
win  their  second  SUNYAC  game  4-2.  Eric  Weidenbach  of  Clarkston, 
MI,  scored  first  with  assist  by  Trevor  Cameron  of  Massena,  and  Jeff 
Paluseo  of  Plymouth,  MA,  at  18: 10  of  the  first  period.  Second  period 
goals  by  Tracey  Belanger  of  Merrimack,  NH,  and  Eric  Silverman  of 
Nyack  gave  the  Cardinals  a  3-0  advantage  going  into  the  final  stanza.  In 
the  third  period,  Plattsburgh  was  able  to  withstand  Fredonia' s  comeback 
effort  and  added  an  empty  net  goal  by  Evan  Sylvester  of  Hanson,  MA, 
to  post  the  win.  With  two  goals  and  two  assists  over  the  weekend.

$100.000  Gift  Over  Five  Years 


Plattsburgh  State  Students  to  Benefit  from  Pepsi-Cola  Gift 


The  Pepsi-Cola  Keeseville  Bot- 
tling Company  has  agreed  to  con- 
tribute a  major  gift  of  $100,000 
over  the  next  five  years  to  the  Platts- 
burgh College  Foundation.  This  is 
the  second  largest  gift  from  a  cor- 
poration ever  received  by  the  Foun- 
dation. 

The  funds  will  be  used  to  sup- 
port three  annual  student  scholar- 
ships, as  well  as  to  sponsor  the 
annual  Pepsi  Cardinal  Classic  Tour- 
naments in  ice  hockey,  basketball 
and  soccer  (men's  and  women's). 

Plattsburgh  State  President 
Horace  A.  Judson  said,  "This  gift 
demonstrates  remarkable  generos- 
ity on  the  part  of  the  Pepsi-Cola 

Keeseville  Bottling  Company.  We  have  had  a  very  positive  relation- 
ship for  many  years  and  have  been  very  grateful  to  Pepsi  and  its 
general  manager,  Roger  Burke,  for 
their  outstanding  commitment  to  pub- 
lic higher  education.  Many  students 
have  been  assisted  in  earning  their 
college  education  through  Pepsi's 
support  and  those  students  are  now 
living  and  working  in  our  own  com-

Student  Life  Programs  Cited  as  Outstanding  in  SUNY  System 


Four  Plattsburgh  State  University  stu- 
dent-life programs  have  been  cited  by  the 
SUNY  Student  Life  Committee  of  the  Uni- 
versity Faculty  Senate  as  outstanding 
among  SUNY  campuses. 

Alternative  Spring  Break,  the  Wellness 
Workshop  Series,  Adopt-a-Friend,  and  the 
HighSchoolEmerging  Leaders  Workshop 
were  among  65  programs  nominated  by 


fellow  institutions  in  the  SUNY  system. 

In  the  fall  of  1996,  the  committee  in- 
vited nominations  from  every  SUNY  cam- 
pus for  programs  that  enrich  the  quality  of 
student  life.  Nominations  were  then  re- 
viewed and  published  in  a  volume  made 
available  to  all  campuses  as  a  way  of  shar- 
ing the  ideas  and  programs. 

The  Alternative  Spring  Break  program. 


developed  through  the  guidance  of  Bryan 
Hartman,  director  of  service  learning  and 
leadership,  was  developed  "to  challenge 
students  to  participate  in  an  extended  and 
intense  volunteer  experience.  It  provides 
students  with  an  experiential  learning

Distinguished  Teaching  Professor  Douglas  Skopp 
To  be  Honored  With  Portrait  Unveiling  Dec.  11 


Dr.  Douglas  Skopp,  distinguished  teach- 
ing professor,  will  be  honored  during  a  4  p.m . 
ceremony  Thursday,  Dec.  1 1  when  his  por- 
trait is  unveiled  next  to  those  of  previously 
recognized  colleagues  in  Feinberg  Library. 

Skopp  received  his  promotion  to  SUNY' s 
highest  rank  in  April.  Skopp  became  the 
1 5th  member  of  the  Plattsburgh  State  faculty 
to  be  honored  with  the  highest  academic 
rank  in  the  64-campus  SUNY  system. 

Skopp  began  his  career  at  Plattsburgh 
State  as  an  assistant  professor  in  the  history 
department  in  September  1972  and  was  pro- 
moted to  associate  professor  in  1976.  In 
1982,  Skopp  served  as  acting  associate  vice 
president  for  academic  affairs  and  was  pro- 
moted to  full  professor  in  1983. 

He  is  the  recipient  of  the  Chancellor's 
Award  for  Excellence  in  Teaching  and  was 
selected  last  year  by  a  student  committee  as 
the  first  faculty  member  asked  to  give  a 
lecture  in  the  Honors  Council  series,  "The 


Skopp 


Last  Lecture,"  in  which 
speakers  are  asked  to  give 
their  hypothetical  last  lec- 
ture of  their  career. 

Among  his  other  hon- 
ors, Skopp  received  a 
Fulbright  Fellowship  to 
do  research  at  the  Univer- 
sity of  Hannover  in  West 
Germany  ;  he  was  invited  to  lecture  at  Oxford 
University;  and  is  the  author  of  Plattsburgh 
State's  centennial  history,  "Bright  With 
Promise." 

Skopp  earned  his  bachelor' s  degree  from 
Dartmouth  College  in  1963,  his  master's 
degree  from  Connecticut  College  in  1964 
and  his  doctorate  from  Brown  University  in 
1974. 

The  Dec.  1 1  portrait-unveiling  ceremony, 
being  held  near  the  reference  room  in  Feinberg 
Library,  is  open  to  all.  A  reception  will  fol- 
low the  unveiling.

for  scoreboards  in  both  the  hockey  and  basketball  arenas. 

"Whenever  we  have  invited  Pepsi  to  participate  in  special  projects  like  these,"  Garrant 
said,  "the  company  has  always  responded  generously.  We  are  very  grateful  for  all  of  their 
efforts  on  our  behalf." 

During  the  past  fifteen  years  Pepsi  has  provide  the  Foundation  with  more  than  $  1 30,000 
in  private  support. 

Garrant  credited  the  College  Auxiliary  Services  with  assisting  the  Foundation  to  achieve 
the  gift. 

"It  was  necessary  to  have  CAS  sign  the  five-year  agreement  that  spells  out  the  terms  and 
conditions  of  the  gift  to  the  Foundation,"  said  Garrant.  "We  appreciate  the  support  CAS 
President  Cheryl  Hogle,  Executive  Director  Stanley  Supinski  and  the  CAS  Board  of 
Directors  have  provided  in  achieving  this  gift  from  Pepsi-Cola."

bility." 

Student  participants  are  involved  with 
building  new  homes,  repairing  existing 
homes,  serving  meals  in  soup  kitchens  or 
assisting  in  homeless  shelters.  Since  it  began 
four  years  ago,  Alternative  Spring  Break  has 
increased  its  participation  to  seven  sites 
throughout  the  eastern  United  States. 

The  Wellness  Workshop  Series,  coordi- 
nated by  Douglas  Morrissey,  a  graduate  as- 
sistant in  Campus  Life,  is  a  compilation  of  40 
individual  presentations  on  topics  dealing 
with  some  area  of  multi-dimensional 
wellness.  Topics  vary  from  "Making  the 
Transition  to  College"  and  "Bike  Mainte- 
nance for  Beginners"  to  "Community  Ser- 
vice in  Plattsburgh"  and  "Balancing  Athlet- 
ics and  Academics." 

The  program  is  designed  to  draw  together 
various  efforts  being  presented  in  academic 
departments  and  student  affairs  offices  un- 
der one  umbrella  to  better  address  the  needs 
of  students  on  campus. 

The  annual  Adopt-a-Friend  program  be- 
gan nine  years  ago  as  a  residence  hall  pro- 
gram initiative  to  lend  a  hand  to  members  of 
the  community  in  need  at  holiday  time. 
Coordinated  by  Melanie  Wyand,  director  of 
student  activities,  it  has  grown  to  include  all 
92  residence-hall  floors,  many  student  clubs 
and  offices  as  well  as  faculty  and  staff  offices 
who  either  adopt  an  individual  or  make  a 
financial  contribution. 

The  Department  of  Social  Services  pro- 
vides the  committee  with  a  list  of  names  of 
some  175  children  and  teens  and  30  adults 
in  need.  About  50  families  are  also  services 
through  this  program  by  receiving  a  holiday 
meal  food  basket.

students. 

Area  high  schools  participate  by  select-

Janet  Worthington's  "Novels  and  Plays" 
A  Comprehensive  Teaching  Guide 


Middle-  and 
high-school  En- 
glish teachers 
now  have  a  useful 
and  useable 
guide  that  covers 
30  literary  works 
in  one  easy-to-use 
volume. 

Written  as  a 
tool  for  teachers  Worthington 
by  Janet  Evans  Worthington,  director  of 
the  Center  for  Lifelong  Learning  at 
Pittsburgh  State,  and  Albert  B.  Somers, 
professor  of  education  at  Furman  Univer- 
sity, Greenville,  S,C>  "Novels  and  Plays: 
Thirty  Creative  Teaching  Guides  for 
Grades  6-12  offers  a  brief  summary,  a 
listing  of  honors  or  notices  the  works  have 
received  and  how  the  young  reader  may 
perceive  the  work,  themes  and  concepts 
encountered  and  lists  the  resources  avail- 
able to  teachers  and  students,  including 
related  reading,  media  aides  and  printed 
materials, 

As  with  most  companion  texts,  each 
novel  or  play  includes  activities  for  writ- 
ing, discussion  and  vocabularly  that  in- 
structors can  select  to  weave  into  their 
appropriate  grade  level  and  curriculum. 

*  Teachers  are  also  given  literature-based 


discussion  questions  and  activities  de- 
signed to  encourage  critical  thinking 
and  exploration  of  the  authors*  message. 
Writing  activities  develop  students*  abil- 
ity to  look  beyond  the  story  and  incorpo- 
rate personal  opinion  and  experiences. 
For  instance,  in  the  chapter  on  the  book, 
'The  Giver/'  students  are  asked  to  pre- 
pare a  chart  that  compares  and  contrasts 
behaviors  in  the  book  with  those  in  con- 
temporary American  society. 

Students  see  a  multitude  of 
multicultural  offerings  that  depict  Afri- 
can Americans  ("Maniac  Magee;"  "Roll 
of  Thunder*  Hear  My  Cry");  Native 
Americans  ("Light  in  the  Forest");  Eski- 
mos ("Julie  of  the  Wolves");  and  the 
horrors  of  prejudice  and  war  ("Diary  of 
Anne  Frank")  among  others, 

An  update  of  1984's  "Candles  and 
Mirrors,"  Somers  and  Worthington  cover 
20  titles  from  the  original  and  add  10 
more.  All  have  been  updated  with  re- 
vised questions,  activities  and  include 
new  suggestions  for  related  reading  and 
teaching.  It's  a  must  for  an  ever-increas- 
ing on-line  population  as  it  offers  re- 
sources students  can  find  on  the  Internet, 
unheard  of  in  teaching  literature  1 5  years 
ago. 


New  Sports  Added 
At  Plattsburgh  State 

Plattsburgh  State  will  add  golf,  lacrosse 
and  Softball  to  it  roster  of  sports  starting  in 
the  fall  of  1998. 

Following  the  recommendation  of  the 
Intercollegiate  Athletic  Board,  President 
Horace  Judson  has  formally  approved  pro- 
posals to  add  men's  lacrosse,  women's 
softball  and  men's  and  women's  golf  to  it 
sports  at  Plattsburgh  State. 

Judson  said  the  four  sports  will  provide 
opportunities  for  approximately  75  new  stu- 
dent-athletes. "We  are  pleased  to  be  able  to 
add  these  new  sports  which  are  gaining  in 
popularity.  The  new  sports  are  either  current 
SUN  Y  Athletic  Conference  sports  or  are  being 
added  by  other  SUNY  schools,"  said  Judson. 

The  new  sports  teams  will  play  a  non- 
traditional  season  next  fall  in  preparation  for 
their  first  intercollegiate  schedule  in  the 
spring  of  1999. 

Improvements  to  the  softball  field  on 
Rugar  Street  are  already  underway  while 
modifications  for  the  lacrosse  field,  which 
will  be  replace  the  old  football  field  behind 
the  Field  House,  are  being  prepared. 

It  will  not  be  without  cost  though.  The 
athletic  fee  at  Plattsburgh,  which  is  second 
lowest  in  the  SUNY  system,  will  increase  by 
$10  to  $55  per  semester. 


Dr.  Ralph  Grover,  Professor  Emeritus  of  Education,  Dead  at  76 


G rover 


Long-time 
Plattsburgh  State 
education  professor 
Dr.  Ralph  N.  Grover 
Jr.,  76,  of  Plattsburgh, 
died  Thursday,  Nov. 
20,  1997. 

Dr.  Grover,  who 
retired  from  the  Cen- 
ter for  Teacher  Edu- 
cation in  1985  but 
continued  teaching  part-time  in  retirement, 
was  born  June  18, 192 1  in  Islip,  N.Y.  the  son 
of  Ralph  N.  and  Mary  B.  (Arnold)  Grover. 

Dr.  Grover  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  Air 
Corps  during  World  War  II  from  1943  to 
1946  where  he  was  a  first  lieutenant,  a  B- 1 7 
pilot  assigned  to  the  100th  Bomb  Group, 
351st  Squadron,  8th  Air  Force,  Third  Divi- 
sion in  England. 

He  received  his  bachelor's  degree  in  el- 
ementary education  from  Plattsburgh  State 
in  1947;  a  master's  degree  in  elementary 
education  from  St.  Lawrence  University  in 


1949  and  earned  his  doctorate  in  1955  from 
Teachers  College  at  Columbia  University. 
He  also  studied  at  the  American  University 
in  Biarritz,  France  and  did  post-doctoral 
work  at  McGill  University  in  Montreal. 

He  joined  the  faculty  of  his  alma  mater  in 
1956  as  a  professor  of  education.  Prior  to 
that,  he  served  as-supervising  teacher  at  the 
campus  school  of  Potsdam  College  and 
taught  grades  6-8  at  Cha/y  Central  Rural 
School  in  the  spring  of  1947. 

Dr.  Horace  Judson,  president  of 
Plattsburgh  State,  commended  Dr.  Grover 
for  his  many  years  of  service  to  the  college, 
community  and  scores  of  students  he  helped 
educate  to  become  teachers. 

"Ralph  Grover  contributed  more  than  30 
years  of  dedicated  expertise  in  education  to 
the  students  of  our  college,"  Judson  said. 
"He  was  a  pioneer  in  the  field  of  teacher 
education,  administration  and  supervision. 
While  I  did  not  know  him  as  a  teacher,  I  knew 
him  personally  and  I  have  heard  from  many 
of  our  alumni  â€”  who  were  his  former  stu- 


dents â€”  that  he  was  a  beloved  individual 
admired  for  his  outstanding  teaching  and 
dedicated  service  to  students.  He  will  be 
sadly  missed." 

Dr.  Grover  is  survived  by  his  wife,  Joyce; 
two  sons  and  daughters-in-law,  a  brother  and 
sister-in-law,  two  grandsons,  several  nieces 
and  nephews.  Memorial  donatiorfs  may  be 
made  to  the  Plattsburgh  State  College  Foun- 
dation or  the  American  Heart  Association. 

Annual SEFA  Campaign 
Reaches  $35,000 Goal 

Plattsburgh  State  faculty  and  staff  have 
pledged  more  than  $35,500  toward  the  State 
Employees  Federated  Appeal.  That  repre- 
sents 101  percent  of  this  year's  goal  of 
$35,000. 

Although  the  campaign  on  campus  offi- 
cially ended  Monday,  Marly n  Cotter  said 
she  would  still  take  any  contributions  or 
pledges  from  those  who  have  not  completed 
their  forms.

City  Plan  Updated  by  Alum,  Faculty,  Students 


Bryan  McMahon  of  Saratoga  Associates  (center)  and  Professors  Brian  Higgins  and  Richard  Lamb 
review  information  for  a  project  to  update  the  City  of  Plattsburgh  comprehensive  plan. 


Three  generations  of  Plattsburgh  State 
geographers  and  planners  are  involved  in  a 
City  of  Plattsburgh  comprehensive  plan 
update. 

The  comprehensive  plan  for  the  City  of 
Plattsburgh  was  last  updated  in  1982.  The 
current  update,  started  in  September  1996, 
was  funded  by  a  $120,000  Housing  and 
Urban  Development  grant  designed  to  ad- 
dress changes  due  to  the  closing  of  Plattsburgh 
Air  Force  Base. 

A  subcontract  between  the  Saratoga  Asso- 
ciates and  the  college  includes  the  design, 
administration  and  analysis  of  a  downtown 
planning  research  component. 

Bryan  Higgins,  professor  of  geography 
and  coordinator  of  the  department's  plan- 
ning program,  Brian  McMahon,  1982 
Plattsburgh  graduate  and  partner  with 
Saratoga  Associates,  and  current  geography 
and  planning  students  Dan  Kwasnowski  and 
Matt  Rogers,  are  coordinating  the  effort. 

"I'm  the  old-timer;  Brian  is  the  second 
generation  and  Dan  and  Matt  are  the  current 
generation  of  the  geography  and  planning 
departments,"  Higgins  said.  "The  City  of 
Plattsburgh  hired  Saratoga  Associates  to 
update  their  plan  from  1982.  Because  of  my 
knowledge  of  the  area  and  my  relationship 
with  Brian  â€”  he  took  the  first  planning 
course  I  ever  taught  â€”  they  invited  us  to  be 
part  of  the  project. " 

Dr.  Richard  Lamb,  a  professor  in  the  Cen- 
ter for  Earth  and  Environmental  Science  and 
a  noted  expert  in  planning,  is  also  involved 
in  the  project. 

"I've  kept  in  touch  over  the  years  with 
Bryan  and  Dick  (Lamb),"  McMahon  said.  "I 


liked  the  idea  of  working  with  friends  on  a 
pretty  substantial  project.  These  guys  do 
some  outstanding  work,  some  on  a  national 
and  international  level.  It  was  great  to  work  I 
with  them  on  something  in  their  own  back 
yard." 

Part  of  the  project  included  conducting  a 
survey  of  downtown  businesses  that  asked, 
among  other  things,  how  they  viewed 
changes  in  downtown  Plattsburgh  over  the 
last  five  years. 

"Surprisingly,  a  large  percent  of  those 
surveyed  thought  things  had  improved 
downtown,"  Higgins  said.  "More  than  80 
percent  thought  downtown  has  seen  some 
degree  of  improvement." 

"The  biggest  challenge  is  finding  a  solu- 
tion to  the  Center  City  problem  â€”  the  need 
for  student  housing  versus  the  need  to  give 
single-family  homeowners  a  reasonable  re- 
turn for  their  property,"  McMahon  said. 

Although  McMahon  traveled  to 
Plattsburgh  during  the  course  of  the  project, 
he  has  been  back  to  his  alma  mater  on  previ- 
ous occasions  over  the  years.  The  36-year- 
old,  originally  from  Albany,  makes  his  home 
in  Saratoga  Springs  with  his  wife,  Susan 
McDonough. 

After  graduating  in  1982  with  a  dual  de- 
gree in  environmental  science  and  geogra- 
phy, McMahon  received  his  master's  in  en- 
vironmental science  from  the  College  of 
Environmental  Science  and  Forestry  at  Syra- 
cuse. He  worked  briefly  in  New  Hampshire 
and  then  from  1985  through  1990  worked  in 
Washington,  D.C.  in  community  planning 
for  a  regional  planning  commission.  He 
joined  Saratoga  Associates  in  1990.

CAMUS  Project  Brings  Canadian,  Mexican  Students  to  Campus 


A  joint  project  between  the  United  States, 
Canada  and  Mexico  is  allowing  students  to 
experience  the  educational  and  socio-eco- 
nomic offerings  of  their  neighbors  to  the 
north  and  south. 

Pittsburgh  State  is  among  six  universi- 
ties participating  in  the  Canada-Mexico- 
U.  S.  Academic  Exchange  Program  as  part  of 
the  North  American  Student  Mobility 
project,  a  tri-lateral  educational  program 
spearheaded  by  Carleton  University  in  Ot- 
tawa. 

According  to  Dr.  Jeanne  Kissner,  director 
of  international  projects  at  the  Center  for  the 
Study  of  Canada,  Plattsburgh  State  was  in- 
vited to  be  one  of  two  U.S.  institutions  to 
participate.  She  was  asked  to  direct  the 
project  in  the  United  States  and  selected  as 
the  college's  U.S.  partner  the  University  of 
Connecticut. 

Joining  Plattsburgh  State  and  UConn  are 
Carleton  University  and  Universite  Laval  in 
Quebec  City,  and  Universidad  Autonomo 
de  Coahuila  and  Universidad  de  Monterray 
in  Mexico. 


The  CAMUS  project,  funded  by  a 
$306,000  grant  from  the  Fund  for  the  Im- 
provement of  Postsecondary  Education,  in- 
volves the  exchange  of  72  students  over 
three  years  among  the  six  institutions,  the 
development  of  an  electronic  link  between 
institutions  and  the  strengthening  of  profes- 
sional language  skills  in  English,  Spanish 
and  French. 

"The  entire  grant  was  written  on  email, " 
Kissner  said.  "The  text  of  the  grant  had  to  be 
identical  in  all  three  countries,  so  email 
made  it  easier.  Each  set  of  institutions  had  to 
present  the  application  to  their  own  govern- 
ment. Ours  was  through  FIPSE.  Each  was 
then  adjudicated  in  each  country  and  then 
through  a  tri-lateral  commission. " 

Kissner  said  that  the  vast  majority  of  the 
money  goes  into  student  scholarships. 

The  fall  1 997  semester  is  the  first  in  which 
students  were  exchanged  on  each  campus, 
Kissner  said.  This  year,  Plattsburgh  State 
plays  host  to  four  students  from  the  north  and 
south:  Valerie  Beausejour  and  Annie 
Fournier  from  Laval  and  Marcella  Vargas 

[5] 


and  Cristina  Guerra  from  Monterrey.  Stu- 
dents involved  in  the  exchange  represent  a 
wide  variety  of  majors,  from  business  and 
law  to  medicine  and  political  science,  Kissner 
said. 

"The  best  part  of  the  program  is  the  orga- 
nization," Fournier  said.  "We  all  have  some- 
one to  relate  to  here  on  campus.  I  think  it's 
the  best  experience,  especially  for  someone 
wanting  to  learn  (a  language).'' 

Fournier,  who  is  studying  to  be  an  En- 
glish-as-a-second-language  teacher  in  Que- 
bec, praised  the  Center  for  the  Study  of 
Canada  as  well,  saying  the  staff  "is  always 
there  to  answer  questions  and  give  us  what- 
ever help  we  need.  We're  never  alone,  and 
I've  met  a  lot  of  people  through  the  (CAMUS) 
program." 

"Our  ultimate  goal  is  to  have  students  who 
are  multilingual,  culturally  sensitive  and 
well-informed  about  their  neighbors  to  the 
north  and  south  who  will  establish  among 
themselves  a  CAMUS-scholar  network  that 
works  in  partnership  in  a  global  society," 
Kissner  said.

SUNY  Opinion  Survey  Report 

Pittsburgh  Student  Satisfaction  Tops  Among  SUNY  Undergrads 


It  may  not  be  heaven  on  earth,  but  students 
attending  Plattsburgh  State  are  much  more 
satisfied  here  than  at  other  SUNY  colleges. 

That's  according  to  the  SUNY  Student 
Opinion  Survey  completed  last  spring  1 997. 

According  to  Dr.  Henry  Morlock,  profes- 
sor of  psychology  and  coordinator  of  assess- 
ment activities,  the  survey,  "is  a  collabora- 
tive effort  by  the  American  College  Testing 
program  and  SUNY  designed  to  determine 
how  students  feel  about  many  aspects  of  the 
SUNY  unit  they  are  attending. " 

A  diverse  range  of  issues  in  academic  ser- 
vices from  new  student  orientation  programs 
to  campus  efforts  to  address  acquaintance 
rape  was  covered  in  the  survey,  which  has 
been  conducted  every  three  years  for  the  past 
15  years.  Respondents  also  rated  environ- 
ment, climate,  class  size,  freedom  from  ha- 
rassment and  the  college  in  general. 

According  to  the  survey,  Plattsburgh  stu- 
dents were  generally  positive  about  the  cam- 


pus programs  and  activities  offered  in  com- 
parison to  their  counterparts  at  other  SUNY 
campuses.    ACT  concluded,  "Overall,

Commencement  Speaker 

Vonetta  Williams  Reflects  on  a  Very  Busy  Collegiate  Life 


Williams 


The  21-year-old 
English  major 
from  Queens  who 
will  deliver  the 
Winter  Com- 
mencement stu- 
dent address  said 
she's  not  surprised 
she  was  asked  to 
do  so. 

"I'm  not  sur- 
prised, but  I  am  excited,"  she  said  before 
taking  her  final  exams.  "I'm  glad  I  am  the 
one  to  speak.  I  know  I've  exhausted  all 
possible  opportunities  and  services 
Plattsburgh  State  has  to  offer." 

When  Williams  started  her  college  ca- 
reer in  the  fall  of  1993,  she  hit  the 
Plattsburgh  campus  running.  She  belongs 
to  the  Honors  Program,  is  a  third-year  resi- 
dent assistant,  executive  vice  president  of 
the  Student  Association  and  before  that 
served  as  a  senator,  teaches  a  Freshman  Ex- 


perience course,  is  a  teaching  assistant  for 
an  English  101  class,  served  as  editor  and 
chief  of  the  yearbook,  tutors  at  the  Claude 
J.  Clarke  Learning  Center,  is  a  member  of 
Omicron  Delta  Kappa  and  is  newly  listed 
in  "Who's  Who  Among  College  Students." 

Williams  is  a  recipient  of  the  Robert 
Frost  Memorial  Poetry  Prize,  a  Redcay 
Scholarship,  Toni  C.  Bloom  Scholarship 
and  an  EOP  Scholarship. 
Originally  a  bio-chemistry  major,  Williams 
was  supposed  to  graduate  in  May. 

"But  I  wasn't  disappointed.  I  saw  it  com- 
ing. I  could  have  gone  to  summer  school, 
or  I  could  have  taken  21  credits  a  semester 
to  catch  up,  but  I  wanted  to  spend  my  sum- 
mer tutoring  in  EOP,"  she  said. 

Williams  could  never  be  accused  of 
lacking  confidence.  She  has  her  future 
mapped  out,  although  she's  realistic 
enough  to  recognize  some  elements  may 
take  longer  than  others. 

"I  plan  to  start  graduate  school  in  the 


fall  at  George  Mason  University  in  Vir- 
ginia and  pursue  a  masters  of  fine  arts  in 
creative  writing,"  she  said.  "I  will  have  a 
book  of  poetry,  a  novel  and  an  autobiog- 
raphy. I  also  plan  to  do  lots  of  teaching. 
I'm  also  looking  into  a  teaching-abroad 
program  in  Africa  through  the  Peace  Corps. 
Some  day  I'd  like  to  come  back  here  to 
teach  as  well " 

Her  only  regret  was  not  switching  to 
English  earlier,  she  said. 

"But  even  the  struggle  I  went  through 
in  deciding  what  to  do  was  good,"  she  said. 

The  words  of  wisdom  she  plans  to  im- 
part at  Friday's  2  p.m.  ceremony  relates  to 
the  college's  motto:  "A  Proud  Past;  A 
Strong  Future." 

"I  want  to  tell  (students)  that  they  need 
to  carry  out  to  the  world  what  we  had  the 
opportunity  to  do  through  extra-curricu- 
lar activities,"  Williams  said. 


1828  U.S.-Canada  Boundary  Maps  in  Hands  of  Special  Collections 


Seven  original  maps  and  an  associated 
report  dating  back  to  1828  detailing  the 
boundary  between  the  United  States  and 
Canada  are  now  in  the  possession  of  Spe- 
cial Collections  at  Feinberg  Library. 

The  War  of  1812  between  Great  Britain 
and  the  United  States  ended  with  the  sign- 
ing of  the  Treaty  of  Ghent  in  1814.  Ratified 
by  Congress  two  months  later,  the  treaty 
called  for  commissions  that  would  resolve 
boundary  issues  through  subsequent  nego- 
tiations. 

The  boundary  line  between  New  Hamp- 
shire and  Lake  Superior  separating  Canada 
(then  a  colony  of  England)  and  the  U.S.  was 
a  problem  and  was  not  finalized  until  1 842 
with  the  signing  of  the  Webster-Ashburton 
Treaty. 

The  document  and  maps,  which  were  pre- 
sented by  the  Secretary  of  State  to  the  House 
of  Representatives  in  1828,  detail  the  re- 
solved issue  over  the  boundary.  The  maps 
established  the  boundary  at  the  45th  parallel 
from  New  Hampshire  to  the  Akwesasne  In- 
dian Reservation  in  New  York  State  and  then 
set  the  boundary  in  the  middle  of  the  St. 
Lawrence  River  through  the  Great  Lakes  to 
the  head  of  Lake  Superior. 


Hermon  Brown 
of  Grand  Isle,  Vt.,  re- 
cently  presented 
the  documents  to 
Special  Collections 
Librarians  Wayne 
Miller  and  Carla 
Hendrix. 

"There  were  four 
originals  made  in 
1 828  and  we  know 
where  only  two  of 
them  are,"  said 
Miller.  "We  have 
one  and  the  New 
York  Public  Library 
has  the  other." 

Miller  said  an  Hermon  Brown  (right)  of 
anonymous  donor  Librarians  Wayne  Miller 

was  about  to  give 
the  report  to  another 
area  university. 

Brown,  who  frequently  reviews  materials 
in  the  Special  Collections,  interceded  and 
suggested  that  the  rare  documents  would  be 
more  appropriately  used  if  placed  with  the 
War  of  1812  resources  available  in  Special 
Collections  at  Plattsburgh  State.

"To  say  the  least  we  are  pleased  to  be  able 
to  add  these  rare  pieces  to  our  collection," 
said  Miller.  "These  documents  will  be  avail- 
able to  anyone  who  is  interested  in  the  his- 
tory of  Canada,  our  region,  and  the  War  of 
1812." 


Alumni  Pledge  Record  $130,000  in  Fall  Phonothon 


With  the  five  most  recent  graduating 
classes  yet  to  be  contacted,  this  year's 
Alumni  Phonothon  has  already  reached  a 
record  amount  in  pledges  to  the  Plattsburgh 
Fund. 

Carolee  Smith,  director  of  annual  giving, 
credited  outstanding  student  callers  with 
generating  $130,429  in  specific  pledges 
from  3,526  alumni.  An  additional  1,907 
alumni  said  they  would  support  the  cam- 
paign, but  did  not  commit  to  a  specific 
amount. 

"Our  student  workers  spoke  with  12,292 
alumni  during  29  calling  sessions  over  the 
past  two  months,"  Smith  said.  "Of  the  alumni 
we  were  able  to  reach,  50.22  percent  re- 
sponded positively ,  either  by  making  a  pledge 
or  by  indicating  they  had  already  sent  a 
contribution  in  response  to  our  mail  cam- 
paign. While  we  know  that  not  all  of  these 
pledges  will  be  fulfilled,  these  figures  are  an 
indication  of  growing  support  on  the  part  of 


our  alumni  for  their  alma 
mater  and  we're  very  grateful 
for  that  support." 

"More  than  40  students 
worked  this  fall  to  help  us 
raise  money  for  student  aid 
and  other  important  projects 
on  campus.  Smith  said  the 
students  were  terrific.  "Last 
year's  alumni  campaign 
raised  just  over  $244,000,  an 
increase  of  22  percent  above 
the  previous  year' s  efforts  and 

we  expect  that  this  year's   Some  of  this  year 

campaign  will  set  another  graph  during  one 
new  record,  thanks  to  these  students.  They '  ve 
worked  very  hard  to  attract  new  donors  and 
also  to  convince  previous  donors  to  increase 
the  size  of  their  pledges.  We  cannot  thank 
them  enough  for  their  dedication  to  this 
effort." 

Compared  to  last  year's  completed 


â€¢'s  student  phonothon  workers  posed  for  a  photo- 
of  this  fall's  calling  sessions. 

phonothon,  this  year's  callers  have  already 
raised  $10,427  more  in  pledges  with  260 
fewer  pledges.  At  least  5,000  additional 
alumni  are  still  to  be  contacted  during  three 
to  four  weeks  of  calling  planned  for  the 
spring  semester. 


Campus  Community  Donates 
To  Adopt-A-Friend  Program

ate assistant  In  Campus  Life;  took  time  out  from  sorting  to  review 
the  list  of  presents  for  the  annual  Adopt-A-Friend  appeal  This 
year  more  than  1,000  gifts  were  purchased  by  various  offices, 
department  and  groups  on  campus  for  130  Clinton  County 
residents.  A  total  of  $1,250  was  also  given  to  the  appeal  to  be  used 
toward  57  food  baskets.  In  addition  to  the  many  toys  purchased 
this  year,  there  were  numerous  winter  coats,  boots,  and  hats 
donated*  A  15-speed  mountain  bike  was  also  donated  by  the 
residents  of  the  sixth  floor  of  Whiteface  Hall.  Plattsburgh  State 
has  participated  in  the  Adopt-A-Friend  program  with  the  Clinton 
County  Department  of  Social  Services  for  many  years. 


SUNY  Student  Survey 

health  issues,  diversity/ 
multicultural  issues,  faculty  issues, 
special  opportunities,  campus  cli- 
mate, college  information/publi- 
cations, and  student  activities 
tended  to  be  higher  than  those  from 
other  SUNY  university  and  state- 
operated  colleges." 

President  Horace  Judson  echoed 
the  same  sentiments.  He  said, 
^Plattsburgh  State  is  a  beacon  of 
light  in  the  SUNY  system.  The  stu- 
dents coming  to  this  campus  know 
from  their  first  day  here  that  our 
faculty  are  of  the  highest  caliber 
and  are  committed  to  the  highest 
quality  of  teaching.  College  must 
be  educational,  exciting  and  di- 
verse if  we  are  to  be  successful  in 
preparing  students  as  future  profes- 
sionals/' 

In  comparison  with  the  12  other 
SUNY  university  colleges, 
Plattsburgh  State  consistently 
placed  in  the  top  three  categories 
over  70  percent  of  the  time. 


(Continued  from  Page  1) 

"Although  no  single  overall  nu- 
merical index  of  quality  is  com- 
puted on  the  data,  the  ratings  from 
our  students  were  significantly 
above  the  means  of  the  other  units," 
said  Morlock.  "An  overwhelming 
majority  of  the  items  strongly  sug- 
gest that  compared  to  students  at 
the  other  colleges,  Plattsburgh  State 
students  are  much  more  satisfied 
here,"  he  added. 

Even  though  the  survey  put 
Plattsburgh  State  in  a  favorable 
light,  Judson  stated  there  is  always 
room  for  improvement.  "Ifweareto 
continue  to  be  successful  at  educat- 
ing students,  we  need  to  address 
those  areas  that  deserve  attention. 
They  may  be  tough  to  overcome, 
but  we  should  strive  to  provide  the 
best  atmosphere  for  our  customers, 
our  students." 

More  than  15,000  students  from 
the  27  state-operated  colleges  rated 
their  institutions.  At  Plattsburgh, 
990  students  completed  survey.

Individualized  Studies  Program  Offers  Choice  in  Degree  Planning 


Hammond 


Students  who  want  to  finish  a  degree  pro- 
gram in  the  typical  four  years  need  to  apply 
for  the  program  no  later  than  the  beginning 
of  their  junior  year.  Sophomore  year  would 
be  better,  Brohel  said. 

"It's  a  vigorous  program,"  Brohel  said. 
"Students  have  to  justify  why  they  want  to 
do  an  individual  studies  program" 

That  justification  is  then  scrutinized  by  a 
committee  and  carries  a  committee  approval. 
Often,  the  committee  recommends  changes 
to  the  project  to  make  it  academically  sound, 
Brohel  said. 

Dr.  Nancy  Church,  professor  in  the  man- 
agement and  marketing  department,  served 
as  Hammond's  faculty  advisor. 

"(Church)  was  invaluable  in  helping  me  in 
the  design  of  the  program,  especially  where 
the  business  courses  were  concerned," 
Hammond  said.  "This  program  worked  espe- 
cially well  for  me  because  of  the  direction  I 
wanted  to  go." 

Sole  proprietor  of  Directions  North  Pho- 
tography, Hammond  was  able  to  mold  a

mond until  she 
walked  into  the 
Center  for  Life- 
long Learning 
and  met  Bette 
Brohel. 

"For  the  first 
time  I  felt  like  I 
was  in  a  place 
where  things 
could  happen, 

where  I  could  accomplish  what  I  set  out  to  do 
because  of  the  structure,  the  guidance  I  re- 
ceived there,"  Hammond  said.  "By  having 
Bette  there  to  guide  me,  lead  me,  give  me  the 
next  step,  I  felt  I  was  finally  going  to  finish 
this  program.  She  never  failed  me." 

Brohel,  coordinator  of  the  Individualized 
Studies  Program  at  the  Center  for  Lifelong 
Learning,  enrolled  Hammond  in  the  pro- 
gram that  assists  students  in  designing  a 
major  of  their  choice.

The  program  appeals  to  highly  mt  ""ecuon  1  wumzu  iu  gu.  Hammond  said.  "As  an  adult,  I  have  an 

--  PriScilla  Hammond  idea  what  I  enjoy,  and  this  program  gives 

you  the  opportunity  to  apply  that  to  your 

program  that  combined  the  nuts  and  bolts  of 
running  a  business  with  the  visual  aspect  of 
photography  and  the  art  of  communicating 
with  the  public. 

As  a  result,  Hammond  holds  a  bachelor's 
degree  in  visual  arts  and  communication  in 
business,  a  degree  not  found  in  the  tradi- 
tional Plattsburgh  State  undergraduate  cata- 


log but  valid  nonetheless. 

Hammond  came  by  her  degree  by  degrees. 
She  spent  nearly  20  years  as  communication 
coordinator  at  Georgia-Pacific.  In  the  frame- 
work of  her  G-P  job,  Hammond  learned  pho- 
tography. 

"Photography  is  what  got  me  back  in 
school,"  she  said.  Although  she  attended 
college  in  the  early  1960s,  she  never  fin- 
ished. "(College  Photographer)  Robin 
Brown's  classes  got  me  going.  I  had  taken  a 
couple  classes  with  her  in  the  early  '80s  and 
realized  I  enjoyed  school.  I  also  felt  I  had 
found  something  I  was  really  interested  in  â€” 
photography.  But  at  the  time,  I  couldn't 
pursue  it  as  anything  but  a  hobby." 

Hammond  looked  into  a  degree  program 
from  Empire  State  College,  which  credits 
students  for  life  experiences  if  appropriate, 
"but  I  found  I  could  not  discipline  myself  in 
a  way  that' s  necessary  for  their  program,"  she 
said.  She  started  taking  courses  again,  and 
then  called  the  Center  for  Lifelong  Learning 
to  find  out  about  its  programs. 

"That's  when  I  met  Bette,"  Hammond 
said.  She  switched  from  an  art  major  to 
the  individualized  studies  program  of- 


motivated  students  as  well  as  to 
adult  students  who  want  to  ad- 
vance their  careers,  she  said.  Not  an  indepen- 
dent study  program  or  one  that  gives  credit 
for  experience,  Individualized  Studies  re- 
quires students  to  take  regular  courses  on 
campus  in  a  degree  program  designed  by  the 
student,  a  faculty  advisor  and  a  committee  of 
faculty  and  staff  who  help  guide  students  in 
selecting  appropriate  courses.

studies." 

A  major  component  of  Individualized  Stud- 
ies is  the  final,  or  capstone,  project  to  bring 
together  all  the  pieces  of  the  students'  pro- 
gram. 

'That  capstone  project  can  be  an  intern- 
ship, a  final  project  or  a  final  paper,"  Brohel 
said.  Hammond's  capstone  project  was  a 
brochure  and  presentation  she  calls,  "What 
Price  Liberty?"  that  depicts  the  many  contri- 
butions made  to  society  by  prominent  and 
not-so-prominent  women  and  the  liberties 
still  denied  them  by  that  same  society.  It 
encompasses  the  business,  communication 
and  visual  arts  components  of  her  degree 
program. 

"I  presented  it  (Nov.  13)  to  the  Women's 
Studies  Forum,"  Hammond  said.  Along  with 
about  200  brochures  she  had  printed, 
Hammond  designed  a  collage  of  photos 
taken  of  the  women  she  interviewed  and 
attached  them  to  a  silhouette  of  a  stooped- 
over  Statue  of  Liberty. 

"After  meeting  with  all  those  women  I'm 
even  more  convinced  that  the  project  had 
meaning,"  she  said.  "There  was  a  message 
there  and  it  was  the  way  I  chose  to  send  that 
message." 

"It  was  an  exceptional  capstone  project," 
Brohel  said.  "She  did  a  wonderful  job." 


Applied  Environmental  Science  Program  at  Miner  Center  Healthy  at  25 


For  25  years,  the  campus  at  Miner  Center 
in  Chazy  has  been  home  to  Plattsburgh  State 
environmental  science  students,  providing 
them  with  a  unique  opportunity  for  hands- 
on  field  experience. 

"Discussion  about  an  environmental  pro- 
gram at  Plattsburgh  began  with  the  first  Earth 
Day  in  the  spring  of  1 970,"  said  Dr.  Kenneth 
Adams,  a  professor  with  the  program.  What 
followed  was  a  year  or  more  of  meetings  "in- 
volving the  administration,  Miner  Center 
and  the  community  about  how  to  address 
the  issues  being  raised  as  a  result  of  Earth 
Day." 

"Gov.  (Nelson)  Rockefeller  came  rolling 
into  the  North  Country  and  made  a  surprise 
announcement  that  Plattsburgh  State  would 
become  a  center  for  the  environment,"  said 
Dr.  Malcolm  Fairweather,  director  of  the 
Center  for  Earth  and  Environmental  Science. 
"It  came  as  a  big  surprise  to  everybody.  That 
the  college-Miner  Institution  connection 
led  to  the  development  in  1972  of  the  Insti- 
tute for  Man  and  His  Environment." 

Department  personnel  were  sent  "all  over 
the  country  looking  at  fledgling  environ- 
mental studies  programs  and  institutes" 
Fair-weather  said.  "They  all  came  back  with 
ideas  and  that  was  the  beginning." 

After  a  short  time,  the  demand  on  the  pro- 
gram, was  so  great,  it  had  to  move  to  the 
Plattsburgh  State  campus,  but  the  program 
at  Miner  was  retained  as  "an  integral  part  of 
the  program  requirement,"  Fairweather  said. 

"Because  we  had  no  environmental  sci- 
ence faculty  at  the  and  made  a  surprise  an- 
nouncement that  Plattsburgh  State  would 
become  a  center  for  the  environment,"  said 
Dr.  Malcolm  Fairweather,  director  of  the 
Center  for  Earth  and  Environmental  Science. 
"It  came  as  a  big  surprise  to  everybody.  That

led  to  the  development  in  1972  of  the  Insti-

Fair-weather  said.  "They  all  came  back  with

After  a  short  time,  the  demand  on  the  pro- 
gram was  so  great,  it  had  to  move  to  the 
Plattsburgh  State  campus,  but  the  program 
at  Miner  was  retained  as  "an  integral  part  of 
the  program  requirement,"  Fairweather  said. 

"Because  we  had  no  environmental  sci- 
ence faculty  at  the  time,  the  faculty  from 
individual  departments  who  had  an  interest 
were  given  release  time  to  teach  at  the  pro- 


gram," Adams  said. 
"William  'Jerry' 
Berberet  was  with  the 
history  department 
and  he  served  as  the 
program's  first  direc- 
tor." 

"I  became  in- 
volved in  the  pro- 
gram in  the  fall  of 
1974,"  Fairweather 
said.  "By  that  time, 
an  environmental  sci- 
ence faculty  was  es- 
tablished." 

"As  was  the  degree 
program,"  said  Adams,  who  himself  began 
his  tenure  at  the  college  in  1974. 

The  mandated  program  was  originally 
offered  each  semester.  However,  as  the  pro- 
gram evolved  and  state  budget  cuts  started 
hitting  SUNY,  the  program  was  turned  into 
an  option  rather  than  a  requirement  and  was 
offered  during  the  fall  semester  only. 

In  1983,  the  program  name  was  changed 
to  the  Applied  Environmental  Science  Pro- 
gram. 

The  semester  is  intensive.  Juniors  and  se- 
niors enrolled  in  the  program  select  their 
course  work  from  five  day-long  courses  of- 
fered, one  course  per  day  of  the  week.  They 
have  the  option  of  residing  in  the  dorm  at 
Miner  or  elsewhere.  Adams  said  the  major- 
ity of  participants  opt  to  stay  on  the  Miner 
campus. 

"We  have  32  students  participating  this 
semester  with  25  residing  there,"  said 
Fairweather.  "We're  essentially  full.  We  have 


Miner  Institute  and  its  surrounding  8,000  acres  of  forest  land  are  an  ideal 
location  for  students  to  study  in  the  field  in  the  morning  and  undertake 
experiments  on  specimens  in  the  lab  that  same  afternoon. 

very  healthy  (enrollment)  numbers." 

Courses  include  a  mixture  of  lab,  class 
and  field  time.  Students  can  take  intro  to 
soil  science,  forest  ecology  and  manage- 
ment, water-quality  modeling,  environmen- 
tal geology  and  field  ecology.  Situated  on 
some  8,000  acres  of  forest  land,  the  Miner 
Institute  is  ideal  for  a  program  such  as  this, 
Adams  said. 

"I  can  give  a  two-hour  lecture  in  the  morn- 
ing and  say  we're  going  out  in  the  field  to 
take  soil  samples  in  the  afternoon  and  re- 
turn to  the  lab  to  run  the  data  in  the  evening," 
he  said. 

Last  fall  the  college  had  its  1,000th  stu- 
dent complete  the  AESP  semester. 

"It's  a  special  program,  and  the  outcomes 
are  so  beneficial  to  the  students;  that's  what 
we're  here  for,"  Fairweather  said.  "It's  posi- 
tive for  the  students  and  it  makes  Plattsburgh 
State  a  little  different."

tations at  the  New  York  State 
Convention  of  the  Council 
for  Exceptional  Children. 
Studies  conducted  by  Amy  Perretta 
'97,  and  Jennifer  Benante  97,  were 
presented  Nov.  7  in  New  York  City  and 
featured  the  results  and  implications  of 
applied  research  on  learning-mediated 
approaches  to  behavior  management 
with   students   with  disabilities. 
Cavanaugh  presented  a  model  for  in-_ 
corporating  teacher-researcher  features 
into  teacher  education  at  the  1997  conven- 
tion and  at  the  1997  Association  for  Behav-

Dr.  Robert  Fuller,  professor  in  the  Center 
for  Earth  and  Environmental  Science,  was 
among  a  team  of  scientists  that  has  just 
completed  the  second  phase  of  an  assess- 
ment of  toxic  substances  in  sediments  from 
three  areas  of  concern  in  Lake  Champlain: 
Cumberland  Bay,  Outer  Mallets  Bay  and 
Inner  Burlington  Harbor.  The  study,  funded 
by  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
Agency  through  the  Lake  Champlain  Basin 
Program,  was  conducted  by  Fuller,  Dr.  Al 
Mcintosh  and  Dr.  Mary  Watzin  from  the 
School  of  Natural  Resources  at  the  Univer- 
sity of  Vermont,  and  Dr.  John  King  from  the 


University  of  Rhode  Island,  and  others.  The 
team  focused  on  these  three  sites  because 
they  were  found  to  have  elevated  levels  of 
toxic  substances  during  Phase  I  of  the  study, 
which  examined  3 1  sites  throughout  the  lake.
