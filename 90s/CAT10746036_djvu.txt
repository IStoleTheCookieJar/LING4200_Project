INTRODUCTION 


Background 

This  project  was  conceived  during  a  volunteer  meeting  of  about  40  interested  persons  who 
were  attending  the  1st  World  Congress  on  Alternatives  and  Animal  Use  in  the  Life 
Sciences:  Education,  Research,  and  Testing  Conference  held  in  Baltimore,  Maryland, 
November  14-19,  1993. 

At  that  time,  it  became  obvious  to  everyone  that  a  resource  addressing  various  aspects  of 
the  alternatives  issue  should  be  referenced  in  a  directory.  The  authors  volunteered  to  work 
on  the  project.  In  the  spring  of  1994,  a  questionnaire  was  developed  and  sent  to  all 
interested  parties.  Except  for  one  or  two  additional  entries,  the  directory  entries  are  from 
those  items  submitted  by  those  attending  the  voluntary  meeting. 


Content  and  Arrangement 


The  directory  is  composed  of  information  regarding:  newsletters,  databases,  publications, 
audio-visuals,  and  computer  models.  Within  those  broad  categories,  the  organizations 
producing  resources  are  listed  alphabetically. 

The  quantity  and  quality  of  information  varies  since  it  is  based  on  information  voluntarily 
provided.  Generally,  each  entry  consists  of  the  following:  sponsor's  name,  address, 
telephone/fax,  descriptive  information,  costs,  availability,  audience,  language,  and  a  contact 
person.  There  is  also  a  note  field  for  information  considered  important  but  which  doesn't  fit 
neatly  into  the  above.  Hopefully,  if  the  publication  is  updated,  referenced  organizations  will 
provide  additions  for  more  consistently  complete  records. 

Final  Note 

The  authors  are  well  aware  that  this  first  edition  is  by  no  means  complete,  but  hope  that  it 
will  be  understood  by  the  readers  as  a  germinal  beginning.  We  hope  that  as  a  reader  you 
will  function  as  a  resource  and  provide  additional  information  or  resources  for  a  second 
edition.  Please  contact:
