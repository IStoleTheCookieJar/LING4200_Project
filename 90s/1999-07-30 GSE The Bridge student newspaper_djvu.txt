| ignts, Camera, Drama! 


Out of the 800 students who audi- 
tioned for the Governor’s School drama 
program, only fifty made the cut. The 
GSE drama department consists of the 
half of those fifty. No one is quite sure 
what exactly it takes to get into 
Governor’s School for drama. A lot of 
talented students try out each year but 
don’t make it. Indeed, you can ask any- 
one on campus; drama students have a 
lot to live up to. Notorious for being 
“loud and obnoxious,” drama students 
play a noticeable role in campus life at 
Governor’s School every year. Most 
would agree that this year’s group has 
been nothing but the same. 

Unfortunately, this year, the GSE 
drama department was not allowed to 
utilize the stage for performances. This 
means, under the guidelines of the St. 
Andrews staff, they could not build, 
paint, or adjust lights in the theater. 
These rules, therefore, precluded the use 
of the stage for a major production. 
Thus, guerrilla art sprung from the mind 
of director, Eric Johnson. “I was really 
upset we couldn’t use the stage at first,” 
says Johnson, “But then one day, while 


Snowtime at the Avinger 


-Lani Golstab 

On July 25": Avinger Auditorium 
vaguely resembled the Star Search stage. 
That’s because GSE was holding its 
1999 talent show, sponsored by the Rec. 
Staff. The emcees for the night were 
Natalie Frith, Mark Darby, and Abby 
Johnson. The twenty-nine acts dis- 
played a variety of talents including 
singing, dancing, acting, and playing 
instruments. Vocal selections ranged 
from the dramatic, Katrina Rose 
Dickerson’s rendition of “Daddy’s 
Son,” to the light hearted, Tim Matson 
and John Bennett’s version of “Kiss Me” 
complete with kazoo. Some students 
chose to debut their own compositions, 
such as Ryan Zimmerman’s drum piece 


“FUBAR.”. Avinger-even-got a-tittie™ 


messy when Joel, Odell, Brian and the 
Pretty Boys covered the auditorium with 
feathers and birdseed during their per- 
formance of “No Scrubs/No Pigeons.” 
Judging from the thunderous applause 
and numerous standing ovations, the 
-udience thoroughly enjoyed the show- 
vase of talent. Could these GSE students 
be the stars of the future? English stu- 
dent Emily Glover says, “Most defi- 
nitely! These GSE students shone 
brightly that night.” 


all been changed in 


-Robin Williams 
I was patting my dog, it came to me!” 
Led mainly by the genius of assistant 
director Anna Ward (who was the back- 
bone behind all performances), the 


drama kids, imitating the Dadaist move- ° 


ment, left the theater and started creat- 
ing sight-specific pieces which were 
exhibited all over the campus. 

Each drama student also directed a 
ten-minute scene which was then show- 
cased in one of five Director’s Dis- 
courses, most of which were performed 
on Mondays at 3:15. An exceptionally 
large audience was found at each of 
these shows, which helped add to the 
excitement surrounding the much antici- 
pated eight-hour showcase of the arts on 
the 24" (known as Massfest). 

The drama department kicked off the 
evening with an untitled, improvisa- 
tional, interactive dinner theater piece 
which transformed the cafeteria into a 
secretive, illegal food speakeasy. 
Around 500 theatergoers were trans- 
formed into participants at the MEAL 
convention and quickly found them- 
selves involved in the “illegal” food ac- 
tivities. Unfortunately, due to the in- 


clement weather, the rest of Massfest 
was canceled Saturday night and moved 
to Tuesday. 

Tuesday night at 8 o’clock, the drama 
department started the festivities with 
an introduction modeled after the char- 
acters from the futuristic show Allison? 
No doubt the dances would have also 
been lacking without the pure energy 
that flows from the minds and bodies of 
GSE drama students. Every Saturday 
night, drama kids are seen busting 
grooves in front of the crowd. 

Yes, the twenty-five drama students 
have played a major role in GSE life. If 
you can find one walking around, they’ll 
probably humbly say they came for the 
love of the theater. Most drama students 
won’t admit they are here for one to- 
tally different reason—the worship of 
Hillary Weeks. The apotheosis of 
Hillary (who played the green bean 
fiend, Gretchen Mueller, (modified af- 
ter her mother)) has been a major focus 
of the drama department. j 

The theater department’s last perfor- 
mance will be the radio show broadcast 
Saturday moming at 8:10 before classes, 
as always. 


The Long Road Home 


-Adam Shupe 


Well, that’s all folks. Time’s up. 
Game over man. That day which has 
been whispered in hushed tones this 
week is finally arriving. Time to go back 
to our own beds, showers, family, and 
friends. Time to leave our safe haven 
from the terrors of public education. 
Time to retum to our mundane lives. I 
imagine, no matter if you are 5 min or 5 
hours away, the ride 
home will be long 
forall of us. But we 
shouldn’t look at 
this as the end. It is 
more like the begin- 
ning of the rest of 
your lives. We have 


some way by GSE. 

And we can all take this experience with 
us. I challenge each and every one of 
you to attempt to change your high 
school in some way. If waves of 
Governor’s School students crash at our 
high schools each year, maybe we can 
make a difference. I doubt that Saran 
Wrap will be added to the dress code, 
or that plastic foons will be available in 
the cafeteria, but it is worth a shot. If 
we just go hon:e and conform to the fas- 


‘We shall never cease from ex 
ploration and the end of ou 


place for the first time.” 


cist ways of our own school systems 
once again, we are doing an injustice to 
Governor’s School and to ourselves. 
Don’t let this experience go to waste. 
Start a swing class. Have jam sessions 
in front of the school. Have your own 
Spirit Week every week. Holda Chess 
or Ping-Pong tournament. Post stuffon 
walls, lockers, cars, and yourself, no 
matter what it 
says. Create lots 
of guerrilla art. 
Dance, even if 
you don’t know 
how. -Mess with 
your hair. Spike 
it, dye it, shave it, 
whatever. Sing, 
even if it’s only 
songs from food commercials. And 
most important of all, keep in touch with 
your friends. Just because we are leav- 
ing doesn’t mean we will never see each 
other again. Most of us are seniors and 
college is only a year or two away. And 
when you get there, the top students are 
going to be those you met here at 
Governor’s School. Plus, next year we 
have the Reunion to help us catch up.

The Dirt on GSE 


-Kelly Keegan 


I was a little disappointed on Sat- 
urday when rain forced the much- 
awaited Massfest to be postponed. 
Nevertheless, I was looking forward 
to spending a relaxing evening with 
my friends in the Wilmington lobby. 
So after drama’s terrific and highly 
entertaining dinner performance, I 
accordingly headed over to 
Wilmington. Well, I was hanging 
out and talking in the lobby when 
suddenly a mud person ran in. He 
features being covered in mud, I was 
surprised that I could even tell she 
was smiling. And then I realized 
with a gasp who this mud person was. 
Yes, she was one of our own staff - 
Abby who CO-writes the advice col- 
umn. What was she doing covered 
from head to toe with mud? I de- 
cided, however, to dismiss my curi- 
osity for the moment. After all, 
strange things do seem to occur in 
Wilmington’s lobby on a regular ba- 
sis. But not five minutes later in 
walked Aaron, Abby’s partner in 
crime—alsocovered in mud and grin- 
ning. 

After the third mud person in- 
vaded the lobby, curiosity got the 
best ofme. Camera in hand, I walked 
out into the rainy night. I heard a lot 
of noise coming from the grass to the 
side of Orange, so I headed in that 
direction. I met Dr. Milner walking 
the other way and he said, “Watch 
out! It’s dangerous over there!” with 
a nod toward the grass. I thanked 
him for the waming and continued 
walking...wait a minute —had my 
eyes mistaken, or was Dr. Milner’s 
shirt bespattered with mud? Naw... 

I had originally thought to just be 
a spectator in the great mud sliding 
games, but sounds of laughter and 
cheering drew me on and I found 
myself taking off my shoes and socks 
and setting my camera aside. There 
must be a part of a person that does 
no t leave with the end of childhood, 
and this would explain why I found 
an irresistible attraction to the mud 
pit. I went to join the muddy revel- 
ers. 

The scene that met my eyes con- 
vinced me that the rain had not 
drowned the spirit of Massfest out. 
Hordes of indistinguishable people 
were making mud-pies, wrestling, 
and generally having a good time. 


Certainly no one hesitated to initiate

When asked to write my farewell col- 
umn for the final edition of The Bridge, 
I was struck with a feeling of bittersweet 
parting, of leaving behind the haven we 
have established for ourselves and re- 
turning to our comparatively dull envi- 
ronments, knowing that all good things 
must come to an end. The process of 
readjustment is painful but necessary. 
At such a time of conflicting emo- 
tions, I am reminded of the closing scene 
of one my favorite movies, The Way We 

Were, with Barbra Streisand and Rob- 

ert Redford. Several years after the 

break-up of their passionate romance, 
they reunite by chance of a crowded 

New York sidewalk. Both have moved 

on with their lives and found love with 

other people, but before they continue 
on their way, they seem to recall the 
happiness they once shared. Let us take 

a few moments to reminisce on the high- 

lights of our adventure together, in a list 

much like the original “Slice of Wry”: 
1. Awkward silences, and futile 
efforts to fill them with overused 
questions 

2. Cafeteria meals, and the perilous 
game of name-tag swapping, some- 
times at the risk of being accosted 
by a snappish worker 

3. The geese, and “tiptoeing through 
the dried goose dung strewn on the 
causeway off the west side of 
Wilmington...” (dedicated to all the 
GSE Ani DiFranco diehards) 

4. The library, and usurping their com- 
puters when the computer lab was 
full, only to perform the sinful act 
of...e-mail! 

5. The pre-breakfast jogs, and the con- 
stant pleading, “How long can it 
take to get around this campus?!” 

6. The nightly conversations in the 
dorm of choice, always followed by 
the “midnight stampede” to get back 
before curfew 

7. And afterwards, the dorm conver- 
sations, and the frantic steps to get 
back to the room before the famil- 
iar “tap, tap, tap” of the counselor 

8. The talent show, and the fine feath- 
ery performance of “No Pigeons,” 
outdone only be the girls’ chants of 

’ “No scrubs!” 

9. The art studio, and the lazy after- 
noon gatherings, making mellow 
masterpieces with Erykah Badu pro- 
viding the ambiance 

10. Yoga, and the impossible task of 
finding our karma while doing 
“Spitting Cobra” and “Downward 
Dog” on a patch of jagged concrete 

11. The computer lab, and the art of 
looming behind the current users 
and reading their e-mails until they 
reach “the breaking point” 

12. The masquerade ball, and the sur- 
real juxtaposition of Pulp Fiction’s 


Mia Wallace, Grease’s Danny 
Zuko, and Jessica Hoffert’s Frieda 
Wilson 

13. Rigorous Wizard of Oz rehearsals, 
and Grandon’s booming outbursts 
of “People! Work with me here!” 

14. The loathed sign-out books gracing 
the corners of Mecklenburg and 
Concord, and the two words that 
accompany any failure to sign back 
in...early curfew! 

15. SGA election campaigns, and the 
sad realization that half-naked bod- 
ies plus chocolate syrup don’t al- 
ways equal victory. What went 
wrong? 

16. Mind journeys in Avinger, and the 
surprisingly sleep-inducing condi- 
tions of clunky metallic chairs and 
a persistent chill 

17. Fourth of July festivities, and the 
practicality of the cafeteria workers 
to drench the unused fried chicken 
in barbecue sauce the next day 

18. Rumors, i.e. the popular, “Do you 
know who was caught making out 
in the Nucleus?,” and the wildfire 
speed with which they fly 

19. Assemblies in Avinger, and the two 
most tantalizing options other than 
paying attention: a) rotating in an 
owl-like manner to search for 
friends in the darkmess, or b) taking 
advantage of the aforementioned 
sleeping conditions 

20. And most recently, Massfest, and 
attempting Tantric lovemaking po- 
sitions as we writhed on layers of 
ketchup and mustard 
A little comic relief never hurts in 

the midst of a dismal situation. Now, 
like Barbra, as she brushes the stray 
hairs off Robert’s forehead and levels 
her knowing eyes with his, we realize 
we must continue leading separate lives. 
The teachers we have taken may never 
be equaled, the friends we have made 
may never be encountered again, and the 
experiences we have absorbed may 
never be recreated. GSE is not our 
home. 

The only comfort to be found is in 
the memories, the pure and untainted 
remembrances. Retrospect has a way of 
altering and even romanticizing the past. 
I urge us to remember the full spectrum 
of emotions each day brought, from the 
painful lessons, uncertainty, and utter 
conft sion, to the unbridled curiosity, 
freedom, and laughter, something I hope 
I have encouraged with my column. As 
Barbra and Robert remove themselves 
from their final embrace, the themesong 
swells to an uplifting prospect: “It’s the 
laughter we will remember whenever we 
remember the way we were.” 


Farewell for now, 
Robert

Ode to Nostalgia 


-Anthony Palermo 


Ludwig von Beethoven once com- 
posed a piece that entranced artists and 
music supporters throughout Europe and 
sings. to today’s musical appreciaries. 
This wonderfully haunting opus is titled 
“Fiir Elise.” Elise was Beethoven’s only 
love. This composition was a symbol 
for his longing for her. The music cap- 
tures me because of its universal appli- 
cation inthemodem world. Anexample 
of exceptionally captivating music such 
as this may be used to express any num- 
ber of feelings. Therefore, I dedicate 
this performance, my literary perfor- 
mance of “Fir Elise” to friendship and 
love. This, as a GSE student, is my last 
willand testament. These are my wishes 
for you: 

To my friends from home, I bestow 
eternal nostalgia and beloved memories. 

To all the incredible people I have 
come to aquaintance with here at 


Govemor’s School East, I leave daily 
thoughts of, “I wonder what they’re do- 
ing now...” 


To all of those with whom I did not ‘ 


converse, J offer thoughts of, “I wonder 
what I would be like if...” 

To the Instrumental Music students, 
I give luck and God speed in all of your 
endeavors. 

To the staff of GSE, I leave the hope 
of further excursions into the minds and 
hearts of ourselves and future students. 

To Alyssa, Kate, Kate, and Jacob, I 
leave health. 

To Elizabeth, I give hope. 

To Abby, Warren, Brian, Sean, and 
John, I offer unconditional love. 

To Kathryn, I give immortal friend- 
ship. 

Finally, to all at Governor’s School 
East, 1999, I give thanks. 


Fast Facts 


-Dustin Joyce 


Well, I guess this is it, my last 
column for The Bridge. Here goes: 
@ The very first public demonstration 

of color television was done on 9 
January 1941. Other interesting 
events that took place on 9 Janu- 
ary—Connecticut became a state 9 
January 1789; births: Richard 
Nixon, Muggsy Bogues, Daniel 
Boone’s wife, Joan Baez, me. 
@ I find Switzerland to be an interest- 
ing country, particularly when it 
comes to beliefs. For example, you 
may walk into a normal magazine 
store, but yet see magazines with 
topless women on the covers just out 
in the open. However, the last c an- 
ton (a Swiss political sub-division 
similar to a state) to grant women 
the right to vote didn’t do so until 


= 4 9 9 0 


@ For the math students, numbers— 
well, really, just one. Believe it or 
not, I know Euler’s number, 
2.718281828459045. You can ap- 


piaud now, or just laugh hysterically 

mw 6d got it wrong. 

@ Okay, you know I have to mention 
something about Charlotte, since 
I’m obsessed with it—the signs on 
Ericsson Stadium are the largest in 

the central business district, and will 
continue to be so, seeing as how 
zoning laws forbid signs larger. 

@ Europeans in the Middle Ages had 
a time system in which the hours of 
the day were of various lengths 
throughout the year. They also be- 
lieved that the southem seas boiled. 
The Greek national anthem has 
fifty-eight verses. 
Fill in the blank. I’m tootired 

to come up with another fact. 
I almost didn’t come to Governor’s

I’mreally glad thot I did. Thanks a 
lot for making it the great time that 
it was! So, until later, good bye, 
good luck, and keep in touch!

So, stop worrying about when its going 
to end and start thinking about how you 
are going to finish it. Write that last 
poem or story. Compose that piece of 
music that’s been in your head. Finish 
that painting, complete that monologue, 
or work out that cryptology code. 
Apologize to a friend, talk to anyone you 
haven’t met, and tell that special some- 
one, “I love you.” Make these last days 
the best of all. I wish you all the best, 
and may our paths cross again.

me in the practice of getting dirty and 
enjoying it. Even though I am not 
someone who normally likes to get 
dirty, of fun to get big muddy hugs 
and participate in the mudslinging 
fights. When the last vestige of white 
on my shirt was gone, I felt as if I 
had finally arrived. Now I could 
understand the huge smiles of the 
mud people in the Wilmington lobby. 
Finally, it was time to leave the 
big happy mud person family. As if 
coming full circle I arrived back in 
Wilmington. Somehow, I felt sorry 
for the unenlightened clean people in 
the lobby who were gibing me 
strange looks. I had to resist the urge 
to hug several of them and spread the 
joy of being muddy. A scant hour 
before I had been one of the clean 
ones. But that Saturday night, I had 
an epiphany. Mud is fun! And even 
when the planned events were can- 
celed for the night, GSE students still 
had the imagination to find some- 
thing great to do. 

Later, looking at my muddy face 
in the mirror, I felt saddened by the 
prospect of taking a shower and 
washing off the visible proof of my 
realization. “This,” I said to myself, 
‘is what guerrilla art is all about.”
