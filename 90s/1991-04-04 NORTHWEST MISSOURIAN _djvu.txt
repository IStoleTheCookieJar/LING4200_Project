Speaker  to  help  celebrate  ^  of  women,  the  effect  c

.  Women's  History  Month 


Dr.  Jean  Kilbourne,  an  interna¬ 
tionally  recognized  authority  on 
the  media,  addictions  and  sex 
roles,  will  arrive  Tuesday,  April 
9,  and  present  a  slide/lecture  on 
*'The  Naked  Truth:  Advertising's 
Image  of  Women.' 

Her  speech  will  begin  at 
7:30p.m.  in  the  Mary  Linn  Per- 
.  forming  Arts  Center,  which  is 
^sponsored  by  University's  Cul¬ 
ture  of  Quality  Project  and  the 
•  Women's  Intercollegiate  Network 
as  part  of  the  observance  of 
;  Woman's  History  Month  at 
■  Northwest.  Kilbourne  has  lec¬ 


tured  extensively  throughout 
North  America  and  abroad. 

Some  of  the  issues  Kilbourne 
raises  in  'The  Naked  Truth'  in¬ 
clude  ideal  beauty,  eating  disord¬ 
ers  and  the  obsession  with 
weight,  caricaturing  of  feminini¬ 
ty  and  masculinity,  economic 
discrimination  against  women, 
sexual  abuse  of  children,  sexual 
harrassment,  teen-age  pregnan¬ 
cy,  pornography,  addictions  and 
the  glorification  of  violence 
against  women. 

The  presentation  is  as  relevant 
for  men  as  it  is  for  women. 


Although  the  focus  is  on  the  im¬ 
age  of  women,  the  effect  of  this 
image  on  men  is  explored.  One 
of  the  major  goals  of  the  presen¬ 
tation  is  to  expand  the  dialogue 
between  women  and  men  con¬ 
cerning  the  damage  these  stereo¬ 
types  inflict  on  our  self-images 
and  our  ability  to  relate  to  each 
other.  Some  images  of  men  are 
also  examined. 

A  frequent  guest  on  radio  and 
television  programs,  including 
'The  Today  Show,'  'The  Oprah 
Winfrey  Show'  and  'Hour  Maga¬ 
zine,'  Kilbourne  has  also  been 
consulted  by  ABC  and  CBS 
News,  '20/20'  and  'Nightline'.  She 
has  testified  for  the  United 
States  Congress  and  served  as  an 
advisor  to  former  Surgeon 
General  C.  Everett  Koop.  In  both 


1988  and  1989,  she  received  the 
'Lecturer  of  the  Year'  award  from 
college  and  university  students, 
given  annually  by  the  National 
Association  for  Campus 
Activities. 

With  expert  knowledge,  in¬ 
sight,  humor  and  commitment, 
Kilbourne  brings  her  audiences 
to  see  that  although  ads  may 
seem  harmless  and  silly,  they 
add  up  to  a  powerful  form  of  cul¬ 
tural  conditioning.

Having  failed  in  a  $3  million 
fundraising  effort,  Tarkio  College 
has  announced  plans  to  stop 
operating  at  the  end  of  the  cur¬ 
rent  semester  and  will  stay  closed 
indefinitely. 

"Regretfully,  I  must  announce 
...  that  the  college  will  suspend 
indefinitely  its  athletic  and  aca¬ 
demic  programs  as  of  May  31, 
1991,"  Tarkio  President  William  E. 
Walker  said  at  a  news  conference 
Saturday. 

Walker  said  the  school's  board 
of  trustees  voted  Saturday  to 
shut  down  the  financially  trou¬ 
bled  four-year  school. 

"The  deliberations  were  long 
extended,"  he  said,  "There  was  a 
great  deal  of  outpouring  for  the 
college.  There  was  a  significant 
regret  in  terms  of  each  vote  that 
had  to  be  cast,  whether  it  had  to 
be  cast  pro  or  con,  and  a  strong 


sense  that  every  person  in  that 
room  would  wish  the  announce¬ 
ment  were  in  the  other 
direction." 

The  board  did  not  say  how 
many  members  supported  clos¬ 
ing  the  school.  Seventeen  of  the 
22  board  members  attended  the 
meeting. 

Last  month,  the  board  said  it 
needed  $3  million  in  cash  or 
pledges  to  keep  the  school  go¬ 
ing.  But  school  officials  said 
Saturday  that  only  $450,000  was 
raised. 

Tarkio,  located  in  Atchison 
County  in  etreme  northwestern 
Missouri,  is  a  private  school  with 
an  enrollment  of  388  students. 
The  suspension  has  also  affect¬ 
ed  the  schools'  dgree  completion 
programs  in  St.  Louis,  Spring- 
field,  Lee's  Summit  nd  Jefferson 
City,  school  officials  said. 

"The  Board  could  not  find  the 
resources  to  open  and  complete 
another  academic  year,"  Walker 
said.

CAPS  robbed 


Dean's  office 
broken  into 


by  Kathy  Barnes 

Neivs  Editor 

A  break  in  at  the  Campus  Ac¬ 
tivity  Programmers  office  and  the 
dean  of  students  office  occurred 
sometime  between  11  p.m., 
March  22  and  5  a.m.,  March  23 
in  what  Campus  Safety  believes 
to  be  a  related  incident. 

A  lock  box  containing  about 
$100  from  the  ticket  sales  of 
"Three  Men  and  a  Little  Lady" 
was  taken  from  the  CAPs  office, 
according  to  Dave  Gieseke,  CAPs 
adviser. 

Kent  Porterfield,  acting  union 
manager,  reported  around  8  a.m. 
that  the  door  to  his  outer  office 
(also  in  the  dean  of  students 
office)  had  been  broken  into. 

Apparently,  the  desk  had  been 
gone  through  but  nothing  was 
found  missing,  according  to  Jill 
Hawkins,  director  of  Campus 


safety. 

While  checking  Porterfield's 
office.  Campus  Safety  officers 
noticed  the  outer  office  double 
doors  at  CAPs  had  been  kicked 
in  causing  an  estimated  $300 
damage  to  the  door. 

Also  that  same  day  at  5  a.m. 
one  of  the  east  exit  doors  in  Lam- 
kin  Gym  was  kicked  in. 

"It  was  first  discovered  when 
officers  were  doing  building 
rounds  in  Lamkin  Gym.  The 
officers  heard  a  crash  from  the 
east  side,"  Hawkins  said.  "It 
definitely  had  been  kicked  in. 
There  was  evidence  it  was  done 
with  a  shoe  or  foot." 

The  officers  happened  to  be  in 
the  gym  taking  extra  security 
checks  because  there  was  a  ware¬ 
house  sale  in  the  gym  that  Satur¬ 
day  morning. 

It  is  not  known  if  the  incidents 
in  the  union  and  the  gym  were 
related.  Hawkins  said  they  could 
be,  but  also  could  be 
coincidental. 

The  break  ins  are  still  under 
investigation.

Lovefest  hits  Northwest 
in  week-long  celebration 


by  Jeff  T.  Behney 

Staff  Writer 

April  8-12  has  been  set  aside  as 
the  first  'I  Love  North  v'esf 
Week.' 

Student  Senate  came  up  with 
the  idea  last  October  after  seeing 
other  campuses  throwing  some¬ 
thing  similiar  to  this  during  the 
spring. 

"It's  to  get  students  excited 
again,"  said  freshman  class  presi¬ 
dent  Jennifer  Schug.  "It  was 
created  to  show  faculty  and  staff 
we're  proud  to  say  we  support 
them." 


Tom  Vansaghi,  student  senate 
president,  said,  "We're  taking  a 
week  to  show  what  we  got  going 
here  (at  Northwest)." 

I  Love  Northwest  Week'  will 
kickoff  at  noon  under  the  Bell 
lower.  The  student  senate  will 
unveil  a  new  student  crest  dur¬ 
ing  the  ceremony. 

The  crest  will  soon  be  seen  on 
t-shirts,  sweat  shirts  and  other 
college  insignia. 

The  Spanish  Den  will  be  the 
sight  of  featured  speakers  each 
day.  Faculty  members  amongst

Six  students  arrested  in  undercover  operation 


by  Kathy  Barnes 

News  Editor 

Six  Northwest  students  have  been  arrested  since  Friday,  March  29, 
in  connection  with  an  on-going  undercover  drug  operation  held  by 
the  Nodaway  County  Sheriff's  Department  since  October,  accord¬ 
ing  to  Jill  Hawkins,  director  of  Campus  Safety. 

Two  students  were  arrested  Friday,  March  29,  and  four  more  stu¬ 
dents  were  arrested  on  Tuesday,  April  2,  in  connection  with  an  on¬ 
going  undercover  drug  operation. 

Jason  Haza,  19,  Maryville,  was  arrested  and  charged  with  one  Class 
B  felony  for  allegedly  selling  of  LSD  on  March  7  to  an  undercover 
officer  and  one  Class  C  felony  for  allegedly  selling  marijuana  on  Feb. 
23,  Nodaway  County  Prosecuting  Attorney  David  Baird  said. 

Ken  P.  Colquohoun,  29,  Maryville,  was  arrested  and  chaiged  with 


one  Class  C  felony  count  for  allegedly  selling  marijuana  on  March 
28  to  an  undercover  deputy. 

Colquhoun  was  arrested  last  week  and  charged  with  alleged  pos¬ 
session  of  marijuana  and  drug  paraphernalia,  in  connection  with 
the  same  undercover  operation. 

Jason  Atkins,  20,  Maryville,  was  arrested  and  charged  with  one

Beautification  needs 
united  effort  of  all 

The  current  rezoning  proposal  threatens  to  be  one 
of  the  most  volatile  issues  facing  Maryville  residents 
in  a  long  while.  The  new  plan  to  redivide  the  city  is 
dividing  its  citizens. 

Sadly  many  permanent  residents  have  seen  their 
neighborhoods  deteriorate.  Regardless  of  where  the 
blame  may  lie  for  this,  everyone  needs  to  share  in  the 
effort  to  make  sure  Maryville  is  a  beautiful  place  for 
everyone  to  live. 

First,  there  are  some  irresponsible  and  disrespect¬ 
ful  students  who  are  not  very  pleasant  neighbors  to 
Maryville  residents.  These  residents  have  used  their 
hard-earned  money  to  buy  the  American  dream  com¬ 
plete  with  garage  and  well-manicured  lawn,  only  to 
have  the  yard  next  door  look  like  an  aluminum  can 
recycling  plant. 

One  day,  we  will  be  the  homeowners.  Do  we  want 
to  live  and  raise  our  children  next  to  a  home  that  is 
a  cross  between  Animal  House  and  Sanford  and  Son's 
junkyard? 

Second,  students  do  need  better  off-campus  hous¬ 
ing  at  reasonable  rates.  New  apartment  buildings 
would  certainly  look  better  than  old,  run-down 
houses.  If  students  had  nice  places  to  live,  they  would 
probably  take  more  pride  in  the  appearance  of  their 
dwelling.  People  take  better  care  of  a  newer  car  than 
an  old  jalopy. 

Third,  residents  need  to  refrain  from  judging  all  stu¬ 
dents  by  the  irresponsible  actions  of  some.  Students 
bring  in  approximately  $12  million  yearly  to  Maryville's 
economy.  If  they  cannot  find  adequate  housing,  they 
will  take  their  dollars  to  another  college  town.  It  could 
cause  irreversible  damage  to  local  businesses  who  rely 
on  student  customers. 

Finally,  landlords  need  to  re-invest  their  earnings 
into  their  rental  properties.  Many  students  complain 
of  plumbing,  electrical  and  heating  problems.  Sever¬ 
al  properties  could  use  new  paint  jobs  and  landseap-^ 
ing.  Renters  should  be  carefully  screened,  and  if  th§y- 
fail  to  take  care  of  the  property  they  should  be  boot¬ 
ed  out.  Maybe  next  time  they  will  take  better  care  of 
their  home  or  apartment. 

City  enforcement  of  ordinances  should  be  stepped 
up.  New  residents  may  be  unaware  of  certain  city 
laws.  A  handbook  listing  them  may  help  prevent 
some  of  the  problems. 

Students  and  residents  will  have  to  work  together 
to  rectify  the  unsatisfactory  condition  of  some  of  the 
neighborhoods.  Perhaps  next  year's  I  Love  Northwest 
Week  should  become  I  Love  Maryville  Week  so  stu¬ 
dents  and  residents  can  take  pride  in  our  town 
together.

Little  shopping  horrors 


Hero’s  nutrition  nightmares 


Your  hero  went  grocery  shop¬ 
ping  today.  Perhaps  it  was  about 
the  millionth  shopping  trip 
where  the  only  things  I  could  af¬ 
ford  were  cat  food,  toilet  paper 
and  paper  plates.  Boy,  you  can 
make  a  real  gourmet  meal  out  of 
those  items. 

While  I  stood  in  the  check-out 
thinking  about  college  students 
and  their  eating  habits,  I  took  a 
hard  look  at  certain  cuisine  habits 
I  have  aquired  from  my  many 
years  in  college. 

First  of  all,  if  I  ever  get  to  write 
v  ,a.book  about  one  of  the  most  im- 
poytant  things  I  learned  here  at 
/.  Northwest,  I  think  I'll  call  it  "101 
ways  to  fix  macaroni."  You  can't 
beat  the  price  of  a  box  of  the  stuff 
and  all  you  really  need  to  buy  to 
make  it  is  milk  and  butter. 

Plus,  you  can  add  just  about 
anything  to  it,  which  really 
comes  in  handy  when  you  just 
don't  know  what  to  do  with  that 
last  can  of  turnips  that  your  par¬ 
ents  bought  you  when  they,  visit¬ 
ed  for  Family  Day.  Hey,  don't 
knock  it,  when  you're  broke  you 
tend  to  have  to  stretch  the  crea¬ 
tive  imagination.  (Perhaps  tur¬ 


nips  in  macaroni  were  a  little  too 
much  for  the  imagination,  sorry.) 

There  are  many  ways  college 
students  learn  to  adapt  to  situa¬ 
tions  such  as  living  in  the  dorms. 
When  you're  only  allowed  to 
have  a  hot  pot,  it  limits  the 
choices  significantly.  So,  my 
roommate  and  I  devised  several 
plots  to  work  around  this  situa¬ 
tion,  such  as  heating  our  pop 
tarts  with  our  iron  and  putting 
cans  of  soup  on  the  heaters  when 
we  left  in  the  morning.  With  the 
small  amount  of  heat  that  flowed 
in  to  pur  room,  it  took  most  of 
the  day  to  heat  the  stuff  anyway. 

If  these  things  didn't  work,  you 
could  try  what  neighbors  of  ours 
did  on  several  occasions.  It 
wasn't  exactly  odd  to  catch  them 
sneaking  in  at  all  hours  of  the 
night  with  a  sackful  of  donuts 
they  had  conned  the  salespeople 
at  the  gas  stations  out  of.  If  that 
didn't  work  and  they  had 
enough  liquid  courage  in  them, 
they  would  hang  out  by  the 
dumpsters  where  the  donuts 
were  dumped,  box  and  all,  then 
bring  the  treats  back  to  share 
with  the  rest  of  the  dorm. 


Another  fun  trick  was  ordering 
pizza  from  a  friend's  house  in 
town  that  was  strategically  hard 
to  find  so  the  Dominos  driver 
couldn't  find  us,  thus  winning  us 
a  discount.  In  the  good  old  days, 
you  could  get  the  pizzas  for  free, 
but  not  anymore.  Thanks,  Uncle 
Sam. 

When  there  aren't  many  funds, 
whether  the  ones  you  did  have 
were  spent  on  frivolities  or  the 
bars  or  whatever,  have  you  no¬ 
ticed  that  food  you  never  would 
have  eaten  for  your  mother  when 
you  were  little  becomes  ever  so 
much  more  appealing?  Have  you 
ever  experienced  the  devil-angel 
syndrome  of  staring  at  your 
roommate's  food  and  thinking 
they'll  never  miss  just  one  item 
if  you  go  by  the  store  to  replace 
it  tomorrow?  Somehow  tomor¬ 
row  never  comes,  and  they  just 
end  up  getting  you  back  later 
when  they  are  in  the  same 
predicament. 

I've  come  to  the  conclusion 
that  most  of  our  parents  learned 
the  same  eating  habits  we  have. 
How  else  could  you  explain  the 


STROLLER 


strange  combinations  that  grace 
the  tables  when  we  come  home? 
You  know  the  type,  dishes  like 
asparagus/mushroom  divan  with 
hotdogs  on  the  side.  At  the  end 
of  one  semester,  all  I  had  in  the 
cupboard  was  green  beans, 
honey  and  popcorn.  After  care¬ 
fully  considering  the  options,  I 
think  I  went  to  DQ  and  spent  my 
last  49  cents  instead. 

If  any  of  this  sounds  familiar, 
don't  feel  like  you're  alone.  It's  an 
art  form  among  college  students. 

We  probably  learn  as  much 
about  nutrition  and  lack  thereof 
thah' wb'  do'  about  aca'deihick  in 

college .  Human ,  environmental 
majors  need  to  give  the  rest  of  us 
lessons,  although  I  suspect  even 
some  of  them  occasionally  fall 
prey  to  a  tempting  Twinkie  or 
two  during  weak  moments. 

Anyway,  it's  almost  summer 
and  some  of  us  can  go  back  to  ac¬ 
tual  home-cooked  meals  and  try 
to  straighten  out  our  diets.  For 
those  of  you  who  won't,  perhaps 
your  parents  will  read  this  and 
prepare  an  emergency  care  pack¬ 
age  ASAP  ... 


Jgpl|  M orris  Code 

,  by  Gene  Morris 
I  Managing  Editor 

A  recent  conversation  I  had 
with  a  few  of  my  friends  on 
the  way  back  to  Maryville  this 
past  weekend  reminded  me  of 
how  much  we  judge  others 
without  really  knowing  them. 

In  our  discussion  we  were 
talking  about  a  powerful  St. 
Louis  businessman  who 
passed  away  last  year.  We 
were  talking  about  August  A. 
(Gussie)  Busch,  Jr.  The  man 
was  someone  I  held  in  rather 
high  esteem  for  what  he  did 
for  the  St.  Louis  area  and  the 
Cardinals. 

A  woman  in  the  car  brought 
up  some  things  about  Busch 
that  I  found  hard  to  believe. 
She  was  talking  about  what  he 
had  done  to  the  Anheuser  fa¬ 
mily.  There  were  bitter  feel¬ 
ings  between  the  two  families 
today,  Apparently  the  An¬ 
heuser  family  felt  they  were 
ripped  off  when  Busch  bought 
them  out  some  years  ago,  long 
before  the  company  ruled  the 
beer  industry  like  it  does 
today. 

She  went  to  high  school 
with  members  of  both  families 
and  talked  abouf  how  they 
didn't  get  along.  She  didn't 
like  August  A.  Busch,  Jr.,  very 
much  and  liked  his  son  even 
less.  - 


It  was  a  shame  that  the  two 
families  didn't  get  along  any¬ 
more.  When  the  Busch  and 
Anheuser  families  first  came 
to  St.  Louis,  they  wheeled  the 
beer  in  on  a  cart.  They  were 
the  best  of  friends. 

It  is  easy  to  have  the  "grass 
is  greener  on  the  other  side" 
attitude  without  trying  to  see 
how  these  people  really  feel. 
Neither  of  us  had  even  spent 
a  day  with  August  A.  Busch 
Jr.,  but  we  both  made  judg¬ 
ments  about  his  character. 

We  were  talking  about  a. 
man  who  had  passed  away. 
We  couldn't  even  let  him  rest, 
but  had  to  argue  about  what 
the  man  had  done  while  he 
was  here. 

It  just  isn't  right  to  speak 
badly  of  the  dead,  I  don't  care 
who  they  are  or  what  they 
have  done.  It  is  just  a  case  of 
having  a  little  respect. 

I  think  most  of  us  would  like 
to  be  remembered  by  the  posi¬ 
tive  things  we  did  as  opposed 
to  the  things  we  would  have 
liked  to  change. 

Maybe  we  would  all  be  a  lit¬ 
tle  better  off  if  we  looked  at 
our  own  shortcomings  first. 
Then  we  would  be  less  likely 
to  talk  about  someone  else. 
Like  many  things  in  life,  it  is 
much  easier  said  than  done, 
but  then  again,  the  things  we 
■  have  to  work  the  hardest  for 
are  the  ones  that  we  end  up. 
enjoying  the  most. 


Readers  offer  different  opinions  on  NY 

Dear  Editor; 

I  am  a  graduating  senior  from  this  University,  and  while  I  have 
not  always  liked  or  even  agreed  with  our  campus  paper,  I  have  never 
been  totally  ashamed  of  it.  I  am  now.  I  am  speaking  about  the  arti¬ 
cle  "City  that  never  sleeps."  Talk  about  bigoted.  You  take  a  trip  to 
New  York  and  expect  to  see  one  city  in  a  short  time,  then  relate  an 
incident  involving  a  stranger  that  you  admit  spoke  in  a  foreign  lan¬ 
guage,  and  then  have  the  audacity  to  judge  all  New  Yorkers  based 
on  that.  You  need  to  look  a  bit  closer  at  home  folks.  You  can  find 
that  same  thing  in  your  own  little  comer  of  the  world.  I'm  sure  you 
could  have  found  a  better  way  to  tell  us  all  how  glad  you  were  to 
be  back  without  maligning  New  York  and  their  people. 

Jeanne  Kilgore 

Dear  Editor, 

This  is  in  response  to  your  comments  about  New  York.  You  had 
it  right  when  you  said  it  wasn't  your  kind  of  town.  I  have  been  all 
over  the  world,  and  I  dqn't  believe  you  gave  my  home  a  fair  shake. 
You  wouldn't  have  a  tendency  to  smile  all  the  time  if  you  had  to  bust 
your  butt  and  prove  yourself  every  day.  I  don't  know  about  you  but 
no  one  helped  me  get  through  college.  I  did  it  all  on  my  own,  no 
parents,  no  scholarships  and,  until  this  year,  no  financial  aid.  Need¬ 
less  to  say,  working  full  time  and  going  to  school  full  time  does  not 
put  me  in  a  smiling  mood. 

And  as  for  being  "grime  caked"  when  it  comes  to  filthy  cities  check 
out  Paris  or  go  back  to  London  and  take  a  closer  look.  The  crime 
you  described  can  be  found  in  any  major  city  in  the  world.  You  must 
not  have  really  wanted  to  see  grass  or  the  sky  because  New  York 
has  some  wonderful  parks.  And  if  you  needed  more  of  mother  na¬ 
ture  you  could  have  driven  an  hour  outside  of  the  city  and  seen  some 
of  the  most  beautiful  land  on  God's  green  earth.  People  who  don't 
know  New  York  seem  to  think  the  state  is  just  New  York  City  and 
Buffalo.  These  two  cities  make  up  tiny  portions  of  the  state.  If  it  were 
so  bad  the  resorts,  ski  lodges  and  the  Olympic  training  center  would 
not  be  there. 

I  have  noticed  when  I  tell  people  where  I  an»  frpjn  they  automati-  . 
cally  prejudge  me  and  where  I'm  from .  If  ihstead  of  going  with  the 
idea  of  what  New  York  should  be,  you  had  gone  with  your  eyes  un¬ 
clouded,  you  would  have  been  amazed  and  had  the  time  of  your 
life.  .

State  Senate  passes  Having  A  Blast 
educational  tax 

Biggest  increase  P-™  far,ind,ivliu^  i?creas; 

00  ing  state  sales  tax  by  3/8  of  a  cent 

in  state  history  £  a 


by  Laura  Pierson 

Editor  in  Chief 

The  Missouri  Senate  passed 
the  largest  tax  increase  in  state 
history  to  raise  money  for  educa- 
m  tion,  included  was  an  amend¬ 
ment  to  the  MoBucks  program, 
allowing  students  to  apply  for 
low-interest  loans  to  finance 
college. 

House  Speaker  Bob  Griffin 
^  said  a  pending  $175  million 
House-sponsored  tax  increase 
may  be  added  to  the  $456  million 
Senate  bill  as  well.  If  the  bills 
clear  legislative  hurdles,  they 
would  be  sent  to  Gov.  John  Ash¬ 
croft,  who  is  not  very  supportive 
V  of  the  tax  increase. 

In  a  statement  released  by  his 
office  the  governor  said,  "The 
Senate  bill  puts  us  on  the  road  to 
reform  in  higher  education,  but 
it  gives  the  taxpayers  a  Yugo  at  a 
Mercedes-Benz  price." 

Barring  a  veto  from  Ashcroft, 
Missourians  will  vote  on  the 
package  in  November. 

The  money  would  be  raised  by 
putting  a  cap  on  state  deduction 
for  federal  income  taxes  paid  at 


$10,000  for  individuals;  increas¬ 
ing  state  sales  tax  by  3/8  of  a  cent 
and  cigarette  tax  by  4  cents.  Cor¬ 
porate  tax  would  increase  to  a 
maximum  of  6.5  percent  and  cor¬ 
porations  would  be  allowed  to 
deduct  only  50  percent  of  their 
federal  taxes  when  state  returns 
are  figured. 

The  MoBucks  amendment, 
sponsored  by  State  Senator  Steve 
Danner,  28th  District,  would 
make  students  attending  Missou¬ 
ri  colleges  eligible  for  low-interest 
loans.  MoBucks  would  make 
available  $50  million  to  lending 
institutions  at  interest  rates  3  per¬ 
cent  below  current  market  levels. 

Currently,  the  MoBucks  money 
is  designated  to  be  loaned  to 
small  businesses  and  water  sup¬ 
ply  systems. 

University  President  Dean 
Hubbard  has  given  the  amend¬ 
ment  his  full  support.  He  said 
anything  that  helps  students 
finance  college  is  a  plus  for  the 
state. 

"The  basic  question  you  have 
to  ask,  and  this  is  what  I  remind 
legislators,  is  education  an  ex¬ 
pense  or  an  investment?"  Hub¬ 
bard  said. 

He  added  that  anyone  the  state 
helps  put  through  college  is  one 
less  person  the  state  would  have 
to  pay  welfare  to. 


911  wins  approval

News  Editor _ 

Following  overwhelming  sup¬ 
port  Tuesday,  April  2,  by 
Maryville  voters,  a  911  emergen¬ 
cy  service  system  will  be  im¬ 
plemented  and  could  be  ready  by 
late  November,  according  to  Pub¬ 
lic  Safety  Director  Keith  Wood. 

"I  feel  like  this  indicates  sup¬ 
port  for  the  system  by  the 
Maryville  community,"  Wood 
said.  "I  believe  the  citizens  recog¬ 
nize  the  need  for  such  available 
services." 

During  his  push  for  911  serv¬ 
ice,  Wood  cited  several  advan¬ 
tages. 

"The  only  number  you  need  to 
know  for  help  will  be  an  easy  to 
remember,  three  digit  number," 
Wood  said.  "The  number  will  ac¬ 
cess  police,  fire  and  ambulance, 
replacing  multiple  existing, 
sometimes  hard-to-remember 
seven  digit  numbers." 

Wood  said  another  advantage 
is  that  the  number  is  easier  to 
teach  children,  and  that  the 
number  would  be  available  at 
pay  phones  without  having  to 
put  any  money  in  them. 

"The  origin  of  the  call  would 
also  be  immediately  available  to 
the  dispatcher,"  Wood  continued, 
"Speeding  up  response  times 


and  allowing  location  informa¬ 
tion  when  the  caller  can't  com¬ 
municate  for  various  reasons." 

Address  information  would 
also  be  immediately  available  to 
the  dispatcher  when  the  call  is 
answered. 

Wood  added  that  the  system 
would  be  updated  each  night  by 
the  phone  company  to  include  all 
changes  in  address  and  tele¬ 
phone  information  to  keep  it 
up-to-date. 

Installation  of  the  system  is  ex¬ 
pected  to  take  about  six  to  nine 
months.  Wood  said.  "I'm  a  little 
bit  optimistic  and  expect  service 
to  be  ready  by  Thanksgiving,"  he 
said. 

Cost  for  911  service  will  be  as¬ 
sessed  monthly  on  phone  bills 
with  582  and  562  prefixes.  The 
cost  for  a  private  party  residen¬ 
tial  line  will  be  75  cents  per 
month  and  53  cents  per  month 
for  a  four-party  residential  line. 
Business  lines  will  be  assessed 
$1.48  for  private  party  lines  and 
$1.04  for  four-party  lines.  Busi¬ 
ness  trunks  will  be  charged  $2.59 
per  month,  business  pay  phone 
owners  will  be  charged  $1.48. 

"There  are  no  other  hidden 
costs,  and  there  are  only  positive 
effects  to  having  such  a  system," 
Wood  said. 


Faculty  salaries  rank  low  in  region 


by  Jill  Erickson 

Staff  Writer 

The  average  Northwest  faculty 
salary  ranks  the  lowest  (12th  of 
13)  among  regional  Missouri 
universities,  according  to  a  report 
in  the  current  "Academe,"  a  bulle¬ 
tin  From  the  Americana  Associa¬ 
tion  for  University  Professor. 

The  "Academe"  reported,  that 
the  average  faculty  member  in 
the  United  States  earned  $41,800 
in  1990-91.  The  average  North¬ 
west  faculty,  however,  earned 
$34,400,  $7,400  less.  These  figures 
are  an  average  of  all  faculty  posi¬ 
tions  and  their  fields. 

"Any  individual  you  meet  on 
the  sidewalk  will  tell  you  they 
ought  to  be  paid  more,"  President 
Dean  Hubbard  said.  "But  the  fact 
is,  our  salary  range  falls  within 
the  national  averages  that  are 
published  yearly  by  the  "Chroni¬ 
cle  of  Higher  Education." 

"You  can  always  pick  out  a  peer 
,  group  that  you're  going  to  look 
bad  compared  to,"  Hubbard  cau¬ 
tioned.  "The  mix  of  programs 
that  exist  within  the  school  can 
distort  (the  averages.)"  ' 

Interestingly,  the  'Academe' 
also  reported  that  the  average  sa¬ 
laries  for  male  faculty  were 
slightly  higher  than  female 
faculty  in  all  areas. 

Because  Northwest  is  a  public 


institution,  Hubbard  said,  it  has 
a  greater  responsibility  to  its  stu¬ 
dents  than  do  private  institu¬ 
tions.  That  responsibility,  he 
said,  is  to  provide  students  with 
the  best  faculty  Northwest  can  af¬ 
ford,  and  do  so  without  forcing 
students  to  pay  unreasonable  tu¬ 
ition  costs  to  cover  the  competi¬ 
tive  faculty. salaries, 

"Really  what  we're  ,  dealing 
with  is  a  marketplace,"  Hubbard 
explained.  "We  pay  competitive 
salaries  to  faculty  at  the  entry  lev¬ 
el,  but  we  don't  have  to  pay  more 
than  that." .  .  . 

He  explained  that  paying  more 
than  competitive  prices  would 
deny  funding  to  other  areas  in 
the  University,  like  salaries  of  full 
professors  and  so  on. 

In  1991,  for  example,  60  percent 
of  all  University  funding  went 
toward  instructors  while  9  per¬ 
cent  went  toward  administrative 
salaries,  and  11  percent  went 
toward  maintenance  funding. 

Some  Northwest  faculty  mem¬ 
bers  are  concerned  that  they  are 
earning  less  because  it  carries  an 
underlying  message  that  Missou¬ 
ri  and  Gov.  John  Ashcroft  are  not 
supporting  higher  education 
with  dollars  that  match  the  talk. 

"I  am  not  content  with  my  sa¬ 
lary,"  professor  of  chemistry  and 
physics  Dr.  James  Lott  said,  "be¬ 
cause,  basically,  it  has  not  kept 


up  with  the  cost  of  living." 

Dr.  Ed  Farquhar,  chairman  of 
chemistry  and  physics  said  that 
the  state  and  the  governor  are 
certainly  to  be  criticized  for  the 
lack  of  support  to  public 
institutions. 

Other  faculty  members  have 
questioned  the  equity  between 
admlnisfrativeiJ  {salaries  and 
faculty  salaries!?  <-'& 

Dr.  Robert  Bohlken;  professor 
of  speech,  recently  wrote  Hub¬ 
bard  a  letter  expressing  this  con¬ 
cern.  Hubbard  replied  with 
"Chronicle"  statistics  detailing 
the  national  average  of  adminis¬ 
trative  salaries  and  he  compared 
these  figures  to  Northwest  ad¬ 
ministrators,  which  were  at  na¬ 
tional  level  or  below. 

"Administrators  are  making 
more  than  faculty,"  Bohlken  said.  • 
"when  the  faculty  have  doc¬ 
torates  and  should  make  more 
than  someone  with  a  B.S.  in 
administration." 

In  1985,  when  Hubbard  began 
at  Northwest,  he  promised  to 
move  $1.3  million  from  other 
budgeted  area  into  faculty 
salaries. 

"I  told  the  faculty  when  I  first 
came  here,"  Hubbard  said,  "that 
my  goal  was  to  get  their  salaries 
up  to  the  national  average." 

Six  years  later,  faculty  salaries 
have  increased  by  3.3  percent 


**These  universities  are  similiar  to  Northwest  in  the  programs  offered. 


while  administrative  salaries 
have  reduced  .9  percent.  The 
budget  for  instruction  has  also 
increased  by  3.3  percent. 

For  1991-92,  Northwest  will 
receive  the  same  amount  of  state 
funds  as  it  did  for  its  1990-91 
budget. 


"There  probably  won't  be  any 
increases  in  faculty  salaries," 
Hubbard  said.  "The  way  it's  look¬ 
ing,  our  budget  will  be  flat, 
which  actually  means  a  decrease 
in  resources  because  other  costs 
go  up." 


Although  he  may  lose  some 
ground  in  the  numbers  battle, 
Hubbard  felt  confident  that ; 
Northwest  would  not  have  to; 
decrease  salaries.  : 

"We  are  certainly  in  better 
shape  to  weather  this  recession 
than  other  universities,"  he  said.

presents 


paper 


by  Traci  Runyon 
Staff  Writer 

Six  teachers  from  the  English 
department,  including  Dr. 
Michael  Allen,  attended  a  confer¬ 
ence  in  Boston  last  week. 

The  College  Composition 
Communication  Conference  met 
to  discuss  and  exchange  ideas 
and  views  about  assessment,  or 
the  testing  of  writing  ability. 

Allen,  a  membership  represen¬ 
tative  of  the  CCC,  along  with  a 
past  colleague  from  Ohio, 
presented  a  paper.  The  two 
spoke  of  "Self  Evaluation  in  the 
Traditional  and  Computer 
Classroom." 

Self  evaluation  is  how  the 
faculty  decides  which  students 
belong  in  honors  or  the  tradition¬ 
al  classes. 

"We  get  worse  self  evaluation 
in  the  traditional  classroom  be¬ 
cause  it's  just  another  form,"  Al¬ 
len  said.  "Computers  get  rid  of 
constraints  about  writing." 

Although  Northwest  is  catego¬ 
rized  as  a  computer  campus,  the 
University  does  not  have  the  fa¬ 
cilities  to  teach  its  students  on  the 
computers  on  a  daily  basis. 

Due  to  the  lack  of  computers  at 
this  time,  the  English  depart¬ 
ment  has  devised  a  new  writing 
program  to  assess  its  students. 
Starting  next  year,  faculty  will 
use  a  portfolio  assessment  re¬ 
quiring  English  112  students  to 
put  together  samples  of  their 
writing  which  must  be  approved 
before  they  can  pass. 

Currently,  they  are  sifting 
through  a  number  of  portfolio 
programs.  At  a  meeting  next 
week  of  the  Freshman  Writing 
Committee,  they  plan  to  decide 
what  ideas  they  do  or  do  not 
want  to  keep  and  then  get  a  new 
format  of  assessment  underway. 

"Many  state  universities  are 
under  pressure  from  the  state  for 
assessment,"  Allen  said.  "Writing 
is  not  a  content  area  but  rather  a 
performance." 

The  gathering  of  teachers  in 
Boston  proved  beneficial  in  Al¬ 
len's  eyes  because  the  faculty 
returned  with  several  new  ideas 
for  the  English  department.

The  Outback  makes  debut  to  crowded  house 


Student  owned  and  operated  bar  to  be 
fun;'  remodeling  and  improvements 


made  in  Maryville's  only  theme  bar 


by  Traci  Ibdd 

Assistant  Nexus  Editor 


The  Outback,  Maryville's 
newest  bar,  opened  last  night. 
According  to  Scott  Sadaro,  one  of 
the  four  co-owners,  about  40 
people  showed  up  in  the  first  20 
minutes.  Sadaro  said  that  he  was 
excited  about  the  opening  night. 

The  Outback,  formerly  the 
Powerstation,  was  purchased  by 
Sadaro,  John  Wanninger,  Jason 
Brown  and  Chad  Jochims.  They 
began  inquiring  about  the  bar  the 
second  week  of  February,  but 
knew  before  then  that  it  was  up 
for  sale. 

According  to  Sadaro  they  knew 
about  the  business  the  bar  had 
done  before  and  knew  with  hard 
work  and  dedication  that  the  bar 
would  pay  off. 

The  owners  started  working  on 
the  interior  of  the  bar  the  Mon¬ 
day  of  Spring  Break.  "We  each 
put  in  about  10  hours  of  work  a 
day,"  Sadaro  said  Some  of  them 
stayed  at  the  bar  Tuesday  night, 
putting  on  the  final  touches. 
Sadaro  said  after  a  late  night,  he 
went  in  early  Wednesday 
morning. 

The  interior  has  been  totally 
remodeled.  The  DJ's  booth  that 


used  to  be  behind  the  dance  floor 
is  now  in  the  air,  and  the  loft  has 
double-level  seating  that  over¬ 
looks  the  bar.  According  to 
Sadaro,  even  the  bathrooms  have 
been  remodeled  and  fixed.  He 
went  on  to  say  that  exhaust  fans 
were  installed  to  suck  out  the 
heat  and  the  air  conditioner  was 
fixed. 

Sadaro  said  that  people  have 
been  inquiring  about  renting  the 
bar  for  the  evenings  and  that 
they  are  considering  that  option. 

The  owners  are  still  in  the 
process  of  planning  events  at  the 
bar.  Big  Thing,  a  band  out  of  Lin¬ 
coln  will  be  playing  on  Monday, 
April  13.  Sadaro  said  that  they 
would  like  to  have  bands  every 
week,  but  currently,  they  are  run¬ 
ning  10  days  to  2  weeks  apart. 

Two  bands  will  be  playing  dur¬ 
ing  Greek  Week.  Over  the  sum¬ 
mer,  they  will  have  a  band  every 
week: 

For  the  nights  they  don't  have 
a  band,  there  is  a  DJ  and  "an  in¬ 
credible  sound  system,"  said 
Sadaro.  "We  want  to  make  it  fun 
instead  of  just  a  bar.  There  will 
be  no  giant  cover  charge.” 

To  keep  it  fun,  the  bar  has  a  big 
screen  television,  darts  and  video 
games.  Sadaro  said  it  is  loaded 
with  everything.  Plans  are  being 


Test  rates  Northwest  students 
among  nationwide  norms

The  results  from  the  ETS 
Academic  Profile  test  the 
seniors  took  are  back  and 
Northwest  was  comparable  to 
the  nationwide  norms. 

Seniors  from  Augustana  Col¬ 
lege  in  South  Dakota,  Concor¬ 
dia  College  in  Minnesota, 
University  of  Wisconsin  Eau 
Claire,  in  Wisconsin,  and  Mis¬ 
souri  Southern  State  College 
were  some  of  the  participants 
in  the  profile. 

"I'm  pleased  with  the  results 
for  the  first  time  through,"  Dr. 
Patt  VanDyke,  coordinator  of 
assessment  at  the  Talent  De¬ 
velopment  Center  said. 

Although  the  results  were 
good,  changes  may  still  be 
made  in  some  areas.  In  a  few 
years,  VanDyke  estimates  that 
the  scores  will  be  evaluated  ac¬ 
cording  to  the  new  CORE  and 
the  University's  goals  to  see 
how  well  they  have  worked 
together. 

Another  important  feedback 
result  has  been  received.  The 
College  Student  Experiences 
Questionnairs  has  broken 
down  the  students  into  the 
four  colleges  to  see  how  much 


knowledge  has  been  learned. 

"This  survey  pinpoints  the 
estimate  of  gains’ for  students,"  - 
VanDyke  explained. 

The  survey  asked  how  much 
the  student  gained  in  various 
areas,  such  as  knowing  one¬ 
self,  working  in  teams  and  tfie; 
different  areas  of  education  like 
science,  math  and  computers. 

"We  need  to  turn  out  as 
balanced  and  wholesome  peo¬ 
ple  as  we  can,"  VanDyke  said. 

The  trend  now  is  to  broadly 
educate  the  students  and  let 
the  company  or  organization 
teach  the  way  they  want  that 
person  to  work.  This  leaves  the 
emphasis  on  general  education 
and  takes  it  away  from  the  stu¬ 
dents'  majors. 

"We  often. hear  'as  soon  as  I 
get  that  requirement  out  of  the 
way'  and  it  becomes  a  part  of 
the  culture  of  all  campuses," 
VanDyke  said.  "We  need  to 
shift  from  competition  to 
cooperation." 

The  survey  will  be  used  to 
decide  which  colleges  need  to 
improve  in  specific  areas.  The 
results  will  also  allow  the  ad¬ 
ministrators  to  think  of  alterna¬ 
tives  to  make  the  changes  or  to 
see  if  a  change  really  needs  to 
be  made.

made  for  events  like  contests, 
give-aways,  amateur  nights  and 
pool  tournaments. 

Due  to  the  time  factor,  not 
everything  they  wanted  to  do  to 
the  bar  got  accomplished.  "We 
wanted  to  hurry  up  and  get  it 
open,"  Sadaro  said. 

The  outside  of  the  building 
was  not  redone.  The  door  was 
painted,  but  over  the  summer, 
they  would  like  to  refinish  the  ex¬ 
terior  and  make  the  building  look 


brand  new.  "It's  a  solid  building. 

If  a  tornado  came  through,  it 
wouldn't  hurt  it,"  said  Sadaro. 
They  would  also  like  to  put  glass 
windows  in  the  front  of  the 
building  so  people  can  see  in. 

They  also  hope  to  put  in  a  fry 
kitchen  over  the  summer.  This 
would  allow  them  to  expand  the 
bar,  by  serving  hamburgers  and 
fries. 

The  bar  is  also  expanding  in 
the  way  of  t-shirt  sales.  Sadaro 


said  the  shirts  should  be  in  at  the  w 
end  of  this  week  or  early  next 
week.  They  will  have  the  Out¬ 
back  logo  and  motto  on  them. 

The  Outback  is  open  Tuesday 
through  Friday,  2  p.m.  to  1  a.m. 
and  according  to  Sadaro  will 
probably  open  at  10  a.m.  on  ^ 
Saturdays. 

The  bar  has  special  features 
like  a  Friday  Happy  Hour  from 
2  to  6  p.m.  and  Over-Under 
Night  two  nights  a  week.  . 


Buildings  need  modernization 


State  slashes  University 
repair  funds  with  Bill  17

students  and  we 
need  money  for 
that. n 


by  Charmla  Thoren 

Staff  Writer _ 

Many  students  simply  do  not 
have  enough  money  for  every¬ 
thing  they  need.  So  many  times 
students  will  sacrifice  one  bill  in 
order  to  pay  another.  The 
University  understands  this 
problem  because  it  is  lacking  in 
funds,  too. 

House  Bill  17  is  "an  act  to  ap¬ 
propriate  money  for  capital  im¬ 
provement  projects  involving  the 
repair,  replacement  and  main¬ 
tenance  of  state  buildings  and 
facilities..." 

Section  17.040  of  this  bill  allo¬ 
cated  $58,298  to  Northwest  for 
repair  or  replacement  in 
emergencies. 

"University  of  Missouri  is  get¬ 
ting  the  lion's  share,"  Warren 
Gose,  vice  president  for  finance, 
said.  "Of  course  they  have  a  lot 
of  buildings,  too." 

According  to  Gose,  the  Univer¬ 
sity  asked  for  a  total  of  $9,098,666 
and  received  less  than  1  percent 
of  what  they  asked  for. 

"We  want  to  be  able  to  get  the 
very  best  for  our  students  and  we 
need  money  for  that,"  Gose  said. 

There  are  four  categories  the 


money  is  to  be  used  for:  main¬ 
tenance  and  repair,  remodeling 
and  renovation,  planning  and 
new  construction.  According  to 
Gose,  the  University  asked  for 
most  of  the  money  for  main¬ 
tenance  and  repair,  which  would 
aid  in  the  repair  of  Lamkin  Gym. 

"We're  only  allowed  to  use  97 
percent  of  the  appropriation," 
Gose  said.  "We  ask  for  the  re¬ 
maining  3  percent  in  April." 

The  small  amount  of  money 
the  University  received  cannot 
cover  all  of  the  expenses  the 
University  has. 

"Colden  Hall  and  Garrett- 
Strong  need  modernized  some 
day,"  Gose  explained. 

He  also  added  that  Martindale 
Gym  needs  air  conditioning  in¬ 
stalled  and  shower  and  locker 
repair.  Another  problem  is  the 
storage  tanks  need  to  be  upgrad¬ 
ed  due  to  a  federal  mandate. 

"It  just  won't  get  done,"  Gose 
said.  "We  don't  have  the  money." 

Although  the  University  pro¬ 
vides  services  to  check  for 
problems  on  roofs  and  on  the 
rest  of  the  buildings,  no  one  can 
be  prepared  for  the  unexpected 
damages  that  occur. 


-Warren  Gose 

vice  president  for  finance 


"The  elevator  in  Colden  Hall 
went  out  last  week,"  Gose  ex¬ 
plained.  "That  repair  was  a  little 
less  than  $30,000." 

The  money  from  this  bill  does 
not  include  residence  halls  or  the 
student  union.  It  can  only  be 
used  for  buildings  that  hold 
classes. 

According  to  Gose,  even 
though  there  are  bills  in  the 
House  and  Senate  trying  to  get 
more  money  for  higher  educa¬ 
tion,  next  year  does  not  seem  to 
look  any  better. 

"It  doesn't  look  like  we'll  be  get¬ 
ting  a  penny  more,"  Gose  said. 
"The  base  is  being  reduced  from 
97  percent  to  94.5  percent."

Bridge  one  step  closer  to  completion

Staff  Writer 

Environmental  Services  has 
not  burned  any  bridges  in  hurry¬ 
ing  the  completion  of  the  bridge 
at  the  north  end  of  campus.  Af¬ 
ter  a  five  year  delay,  construction 
on  the  bridge  at  the  north  end  of 
campus  began  Feb.  20. 

The  bridge  that  once  occupied 
this  spot  was  closed  down  be¬ 
cause  it  was  considered  unsafe 
tp  for  driving.  The  pathway  re¬ 
mained  untouched  until  approx¬ 
imately  two  years  ago  when  the 
University  purchased  the  land 
for- its  owrf  purposes.  • 

At  that  time,  the  city  of 

Tarkio:

dents  to  finish  their  studies  at 
Sterling  College  in  Sterling, 
"If)  Kan.,  Tarkio  public  relations 
director  Kristine  Christlieb  said. 

Tarkio,  which  was  founded  in 
1883,  was  also  severely  strapped 
by  its  $9.9  million  debt  to  the  U.S. 
Department  of  Education  for  fed- 
eral  grants  and  student  loans. 

Much  of  that  resulted  from 
programs  begun  by  former 
school  President  Dennis 
Spellman.  Although  enrollment 
mushroomed  under  such  pro- 
31  grams,  student  loan  defaults  also 
grew,  ending  with  Spellman's 
departure. 

Spellman  is  currently  under  in¬ 
vestigation  by  the  Department  of 
Education,  which  is  alleging 
$l.  similar  loan  default  irregularities 
at  Missouri  Valley  College  in 
Marshall,  where  Spellman  was 
vice  president. 


When  you  party 
remember  to... 


Maryville,  Nodaway  County  and 
Polk  Township  in  conjunction 
with  Northwest  received  a  grant 
which  would  pay  for  80  percent 
of  the  funding  for  this  new  path¬ 
way.  The  remaining  20  percent 
would  be  divided  among  those 
involved  in  the  project. 

The  construction  crew  has 
nearly  finished  clearing  and 
preparing  the  area,  according  to 
Garth  Parker,  director  of  environ¬ 
mental  services. 

The  crew  expects  to  be  done 
with  the  roadway  by  June  1. 
"That's  when  the  contractor  has 
to  have  it  done  or  start  paying  a 
penalty,"  Parker  said. 

Parker  said  it  will  be  a  24  to  28 
foot  concrete  road  with  a  side¬ 
walk  on  the  west  side  of  the 


road. 

The  original  plan  was  for  the 
University  to  construct  the  road 
by  itself,  but  that  plan  changed. 

"At  the  cities  request  we  have 
gone  through  a  federal  grant 
process  and  have  received  federal 
funds  for  the  road  and  because 
of  that  it  has  taken  quite  a  bit  of  1 
time  to  get  the  paperwork 
cleared  through  the  state  and 
through  the  federal  government 
and  also  to  get  the  appropriate 
design  work  done  by  an 
engineer." 

He  added  that  sampling  of  the 
dirt  also  had  to  be  done  and  they 
had  to  go  through  a  bid  process. 
The  engineer's  working  on  the 
project  is  Middleton  of  Maryville 
and  Locke  Sand  and  Gravel  is 


the  contractor. 

"There  are  a  lot  of  people  in¬ 
volved,  the  city  is  involved,  the 
county,  Polk  township  and  the 
University,"  Parker  said. 

"We  hope  the  students  will  be 
patient,"  Garth  Parker  said.  "The 
path  may  be  steep,  but  we'll  try 
to  keep  it  in  good  condition  so  it 
doesn't  get  dangerous." 

It  has  been  difficult  at  times  for 
some  of  the  students  who  use 
the  bridge  on  a  daily  basis  to  re¬ 
main  patient. 

"The  walk  is  okay,  but  it's  about 
time,"  Teresa  Mattson,  tenant  of 
Northridge  Apartments  said. 
"It's  ridiculous  to  have  to  drive  all 
the  way  around  the  block.  It'll  be 
nice  when  you  can  drive  straight 
through  to  campus."

Two  incidents  involving  Delta 
Chi  members  and  other  students 
have  occurred  recently  resulting 
in  arrests,  assault  charges  and 
property  damages.  But  things  are 
getting  "back  to  normal"  accord¬ 
ing  to  Keith  Wood,  director  of 
Maryville  Public  Safety. 

The  incidents  started  at  12:30 
a.m.  Thursday,  March  21,  when 
two  arrests  for  fighting  were 
made  at  the  Maryville  Pub,  414 
N.  Main,  after  an  alleged  brawl 
took  place  involving  two  stu¬ 
dents.  Other  students  got  in¬ 
volved,  including  bouncer  Eric 
Livengood. 

Livengood  and  MacArther 
Joiner  were  arrested,  while  as¬ 
sault  charges  were  filed  against 
student  John  Washington,  who 
allegedly  hit  students  Mike 
Shane  and  Kerri  Howard  that 
morning  at  the  Pub.  Charges 
were  filed  with  the  city 
prosecutor. 

Shane  said  he  doesn't  know 
what  is  going  on  and,  as  far  as 
he  knows,  it  is  completely  up  to 
the  city  prosecutor. 

Saturday,  March  23,  the  Delta 
Chi  house  was  vandalized  by  a 
group  of  students  throwing 
bricks  breaking  four  windows, 
three  light  fixtures  and  denting 
the  door.  A  few  of  the  neighbor's

D.J.  Jones,  a  music  major  at¬ 
tending  Penn  Valley  College,  won 
the  Miss  Northwest  Scholarship 
Pegeant  held  last  Saturday  even¬ 
ing  March  30  at  the  Mary  Linn 
Performing  Arts  Center. 

Jones  was  crowned  Miss 
Northwest  Missouri  for  1991  by 
last  year's  winner  Kim  Todd. 

Besides  Miss  Northwest, 
another  pageant  winner  was 
crowned.  Christina  Lynn  Grahl, 


the  5-year-old  daughter  of  Steve 
and  Sherry  Grahl  of  Maitland 
received  the  honor  of  becoming 
Little  Miss  Northwest. 

Jones,  a  past  winner  of  the 
Miss  Cameron  and  the  Miss 
Show  Me  contests  and  second 
runner  up  for  Miss  Missouri 
hopes  to  use  the  win  in  the  Miss 
Northwest  Pageant  to  propel  her 
to  a  win  in  the  Miss  Missouri 
Pageant.  She  plans  to  continue 
her  college  work  by  using  the 
$1,000  scholarship  and  the  $700 
from  the  businesses  in  the 


Maryville  area. 

The  Miss  Northwest  contes¬ 
tants  competed  in  four  events: 
the  interview  portion  was  worth 
30  percent  of  the  total  amount  of 
points,  the  talent  competition 
worth  40  percent,  the  swimsuit 
competition  worth  15  percent 
and  the  evening  gown  also  worth 
15  percent.  • 

In  recent  years  the  scoring  has 
been  changed  to  reflect  the  idea 
that  Miss  Northwest  is  a  scholar¬ 
ship  pageant  instead  of  a  beauty 
pageant. 


yards  were  also  damaged. 

One  of  the  fraternity  member's 
car  was  put  in  neutral  and 
pushed  down  the  road.  No 
damage  was  done.  The  police  - 
were  contacted,  but  no  one  has 
been  charged  for  the  incident.  • 
However,  the  Delta  Chis  are 
planning  on  prosecuting  the  stu¬ 
dents  if  they  can  be  identified. 
Four  students  were  identified  as 
allegedly  being  at  the  house  that 
night  and  are  considered  sus¬ 
pects  in  the  occurrence. 
However,  they  have  not  been 
identified  as  actually  causing  the 
damage,  according  to  Lt.  Dave 
Lin. 

"We  have  connected  the  two 
incidents  together,"  he  added. 

"We  are  prosecuting  only  to 
receive  damages  caused  to  the 
house,"  said  Delta  Chi  President 
Chris  Brockmeier. 

Washington  said  that  he  can't 
see  why  the  two  incidents  are 
connected.  He  claims  he  was  not 
at  the  Delta  Chi  house  that  night, 
but  does  admit  having  a  confron¬ 
tation  with  Shane  at  the  Pub. 

According  to  Wood,  although 
the  original  incident  at  the  bar 
was  between  one  white  male  and 
one  black  male  this  is  not  a  racial 
matter.  This  is  not  group  against 
group  situation  and  should  not 
be  taken  that  way  either.  Things 
are  dying  out,  and  the  police  are 
investigating  the  incidents  and 
suspects  for  what  has  already 
taken  place. 

"It  is  something  we  consider 
dropped  and  are  staying  out  of." 
said  Steve  Linder,  Delta  Chi  vice 
president.  "I  think  it  is  all  cleared 
up  and  a  mix  up." 

The  management  at  the  Pub  is 
not  planning  on  charging  anyone 
for  the  damage  during  the 
incident.

an  awards  banquet.  The  awards

excellence. 

The  scheduled  I  Love  North¬

project  that  fell  through.  Van¬ 
saghi  believes  the  reason  the 
project  fell  through  was  because 
it  was  introduced  too  late  with 
only  a  few  groups  willing  to  par¬ 
ticipate.

Over  the 
pickle  barrel 


Softball  team  tied  for  first  in  conference 


by  Joe  Bowersox 
Sports  Editor 


When  my  pals  and  myself 
dipped  our  hands  into  the 
pickle  barrel  this  week,  we 
just  couldn't  help  but  talking 
about  the  NCAA  tournament. 
The  Final  Four  has  come  and 
gone  once  again,  and  once 
again  the  best  team  watched 
from  the  sidelines. 

UNLV  was  supposed  to.be 
there,  Kansas  Was  not.  North 
Carolina  occasionally  gets 
there,  and  Duke  lives  there. 

Yes,  Duke  has  finally 
claimed  its  final  quest.  After 
four  previous  attempts,  the 
dreams  of  a  championship  fi¬ 
nally  came  true. 

But  the  funny  thing  is,  just 
like  in  most  tournaments, 
Duke  is  not;  the  best  team  in 
college  basketball.  Only  a  man 
wearing  horse  blinders  would 
disagree. 

UNLV  proved  they  were  the 
best  all  season  long.  UNLV 
embarrassed  everyone  this 
season;  even  Arkansas  at 
Arkansas. 

This  point  should  not  take 
away  the  fact  that  Duke  played 
an  excellent  game  against 
UNLV  and  Kansas. 

Duke  started  the  ball  rolling 
at  the  right  time,  just  like 
many  other  NCAA  champs 
have.  Fact  is,  the  best  team 
does  not  always  win. 

Think  back  two  tourna¬ 
ments  ago  when  Michigan 
met  Seton  Hall.  Neither  of 
these  teams  were  expected  to 
even  be  close  to  the  Final  Four. 
Heck,  Michigan  didn't  even 
have  a  coach  until  a  few  days 
before  the  tournament, 
i  So  dojes  this  mean  that, they 
were  the  two  best  teams  in  the 
nation?  Of  course  not.  Was 
Villanova  the  best  team  when 
they  upset  the  great  Geor¬ 
getown  team  in  1985? 

Absolutely  not.  Villanova 
was  so  hot  that  they  only 
missed  one  shot  in  the  second 
half  against  Georgetown.  That 
is  a  record  that  will  -stand  for 
some  time. 

Danny  Manning's  Kansas 
team  was  even  on  a  roll.  Just 
look  back  at  past  champions, 
and  it  shows  that  the  best 
team  does  not  always  win. 
North  Carolina  State's  win 
over  Houston  and  Indiana's 
last-second  victory  over  Syra¬ 
cuse  are  perfect  examples. 

As  great  as  UNLV's  team 
was  this  season,  it  still  holds 
true  that  anything  can  happen 
in  a  tournament.  It  sure  makes 
John  Wooden's  UCLA  teams 
look  that  much  better. 

Duke's  efforts  should  not  be 
cut  short.  What  they  accom¬ 
plished  is  historical,  but  we 
must  realize  that  there  is  a 
difference  between  the  best 
team  in  the  nation  and  the  na¬ 
tional  champions.

Just  when  the  Northwest  Mis¬ 
souri  State  softball  team  looked 
to  be  on  the  brink  of  a  disastrous 
season,  the  'Kittens  stormed  to  a 
4-1  mark  in  the  MIAA  North  Di¬ 
vision  and  knotted  themselves 
into  a  three-way  tie  for  first  place 
after  last  weekends'  MIAA  round 
robin  tournament. 

"We  played  really  well  and 
came  together  as  a  team,"  North¬ 
west  Coach  Gayla  Eckoff  said. 
"Our  pitching  was  strong  and  we 
had  some  players  put  out  a  good 
effort  at  the  plate  and  the  field." 

Northwest,  the  host  team  for 
the  tournament  held  at  Beal 
Park,  set  the  tone  for  what  was 
to  come  in  their  opening  game 
against  Northeast  Missouri  State 
University. 

Holding  a  slim  2-1  advantage 
in  the  fourth  inning.  Shannon 
Armstrong  ignited  a  Bearkitten 


scoring  barrage  with  a  triple  to 
help  propel  Northwest  to  a  6-1 
lead  which  stood  as  the  final 
score.  Armstrong  proved  to  have 
the  hot  bat  throughout  the  game 
as  the  freshman's  four  hits  tied  a 
school  record, 

The  Bearkittens  kept  their  bats 
alive  in  the  next  contest,  gaining 
five  first-inning  runs  enroute  to 
a  7-2  win  over  Lincoln.  The  Lady 
Blue  Tigers  did  not  help  their 
cause  in  committing  seven  errors 
while  gaining  only  four  hits. 

The  win  was  a  costly  one 
though,  as  starting  pitcher 
Christy  Blankenau  injured  her 
hip  while  running  bases  in  the 
third  inning  and  was  unable  to 
pitch  for  the  remainder  of  the 
tournament. 

In  Blankenau's  place,  freshman 
Renee  Hahn  finished  the  contest 
against  Lincoln  to  pick  up  the 
win. 

"I  was  pleased  with  the  way  I 


played  and  with  the  team  as  a 
whole,"  Hahn  said.  "We  were 
playing  well  defensively  and 
playing  together  as  a  team  which 
was  good.  It  just  all  seemed  to  be 
coming  together." 

Northwest  finished  off  the  day 
in  a  defensive  struggle  with  Mis¬ 
souri  Western  before  winning  a 
1-0  decision.  The  'Kittens 
received  the  only  run  of  the 
game  in  the  first  inning  when  se¬ 
cond  baseman  Rheba  Eustice 
scored  Lisa  Kenkel  from  second 
base. 

The  3-0  record  placed  the  'Kit¬ 
tens  into  a  tie  with  Central  Mis¬ 
souri  State  University  heading 
into  Saturday's  action. 

Northwest  was  quick  to  break 
the  deadlock  with  the  Jennies 
however,  as  the  Bearkittens  put 
forth  one  of  their  best  games  of 
the  season  in  ,  posting  a  4-0 
victory; 

As  in  previous  contests  in  the 


tournament,  Northwest  jumped 
out  quick  in  the  first  inning  as 
Sandy  Schiager,'  Armstrong  and 
Kim  Koski  collected  runs  in  lead¬ 
ing  the  'Kittens  to  a  3-0  lead. 

Northwest  collected  an  insur¬ 
ance  run  in  the  fifth  while 
Stephanie  Marquardt  picked  up 
the  win. 

"We  played  them  (Central),  like 
all  of  our  games  with  a  ready  to 
win  attitude,"  Eckoff  said.  "A  lot 
of  the  games  we  had  lost  earlier 
in  the  season  by  a  run  or  so  could 
have  gone  both  ways.  It  seemed 
everything  was  going  for  us  dur¬ 
ing  the  tournament." 

Things  were  going  well  for  the 
'Kittens  until  they  tangled  with 
Washburn  University  in  the  final 
game. 

Playing  virtually  an  even 
matched  game,  Northwest  saw 
the  Lady  Ichabods  score  the 
games'  lone  run  in  the  seventh 
inning  as  Washburn  moved  into

Nelson  earns  double  victory 


by  Joe  Bowersox 

Sports  Editor 


The  5th  annual  Sigma  Phi  Epsilon  Fight  Night  packed  1,300  fans 
into  Lamkin  Gym  to  watch  the  14-bout  event,  including  a  double 
victory  from  "Bad"  Chad  Nelson'. 

The  evening  started  with  the  125-pounders.  Chad  Richter,  a  Phi 
Sigma  Kappa  representative,  was  defeated  by  decision  to  the 
hands  of  Tau  Kappa  Epsilon's  Russ  Devries. 

In  the  135  lb.  class,  Thomas  Anderson  knocked  Linn  Shoesmith 
down  for  the  second  time1  in  as  many  rounds.  Referee  Steve  Leon 
stepped  in  and  stopped  the  fight. 

Nelson  received  his  first  victory  against  158-pounder  Cliff  Mor¬ 
ris.  After  two  second-round  standing-eight  counts.  Nelson 
knocked  Morris  out  with  one  punch. 

"It's  the  toughest  fight  I've  fought  in  Fight  Night.  He  hit  me  with 
some  pretty  good  shots,"  Nelson  said. 

Sigma  Tau  Gammma's  Jeff  Skelton  was  a  unanimous  decision 
winner  over  Alex  Briones. 

Jason  Brown,  an  Alpha  Kappa  Lambda  representative,  was  vic¬ 
torious  over  Carl  Scott  after  the  fight  was  stopped  in  the  first 
round. 

In  a  bout  which  was  evenly  matched  in  the  first  round,  the  fight 


was  suddenly  stopped  seconds  into  the  second  round  when  Del¬ 
ta  Sigma  Phi's  Phil  Rodgers  blasted  Phi  Sigma  Kappa's  Danny 
Westhoff  with  a  devastating  blow  to  the  head. 

Nelson  earned  his  second  second-round  victory  of  the  night  by 
defeating  freshman  Jason  Armstrong. 

Nelson  claims  there  are  disadvantages  of  fighting  two  fights  in 
one  evening. 

"It's  tougher  than  I  thought,"  Nelson  added.  "It's  tiring." 

Nelson  has  entered  Fight  Night  for  the  last  five  years.  He  has 
charted  a  perfect  6-0  record. 

Other  decision  winners  were:  Thomas  Brown  over  Tim  Broem- 
mer  (170  lbs.),  Chad  Dennis  over  John  Friedman  (160  lbs.),  Scott 
Parker  over  Brad  Knudson  (175  lbs.),  Doug  Dailey  over  Eric 
Glidewell  (195  lbs.)  and  Darrin  Auxier  over  Rob  Sparks. 

In  the  final  bout  of  the  evening,  Colin  "Cobra"  Reese  knocked 
out  Phi  Sigma  Kappa's  Mike  McKinney  in  the  second  round. 

"I  thought  the  first  fight  went  real  well,"  Reese  said.  "1  had  a 
good  opponent,  but  I  thought  I  was  in  better  shape." 

"It  wasn't  a  battle  like  most  fights.  I  think  I  just  out-lasted  him," 
Reese  said. . 

The  event's  proceeds  went  toward  Amyotrophic  Lateral 
Scherosis,  better  known  as  "Lou  Gehrig's  Disease." 

Sigma  Phi  Epsilon  reported  that  around  $1,600  was  raised  for 
the  charity. 


a  first  place  tie  with  Central  and 
the  'Kittens  with  a  1-0  win. 

"It  was  a  close  game  all  the  way 
throughout,"  Washburn  pitcher 
Rhonda  Rouck  said.  "We  got  a 
run  when  we  needed  it  though, 
and  that  was  the  difference.  I 
think  we'll  see  them  again  on 
down  the  line  (post-season  ■ 
play)."  ; 

Despite  the  loss  which  was  the  ; 
only  mark  on  an  otherwise  stel-  ; 
lar  weekend,  many  of  the  'Kit-  j 
tens  have  renewed  high  spirits  ! 
and  look  forward  to  meeting  l 
Washburn  again.  ! 

"I'm  ready  to  play  them  again,"  < 
Mary  Schrage  said.  "And  we'll  ; 
(the  team)  be  looking  forward  to  ; 
the  rematch."  J 

Northwest  will  have  another  ! 
opportunity  to  prove  themselves  < 
in  tournament  play  as  the  'Kit-  > 
tens  travel  to  Joplin  for  the  Mis-  \ 
souri  Southern  Tournament  Fri-  j 
day  and  Saturday.

Two  Bearcat  rodeo  members; 
placed  this  weekend  at  the  Kan- ; 
sas  State  Invitational  in! 
Manhattan.  ! 

Once  again  seven  cowboys  and ! 
cowgirls  took  the  honors  for  '■ 
Northwest  as  two  of  them  placed  j 
in  the  long  round  competition,  j 
According  to  Bearcat  sponsor' 
Dave  Sherry,  several  Bearcats! 
have  been  contributing  to  the! 
team's  success  as  two  different  ; 
contestants  placed  this  week ! 
than  did  last  week.  ! 

Leading  the  way  for  the  North-; 
west  cowboys  was  Dave  Cannon, 
who  placed  fifth  in  the  team  rop¬ 
ing  competition.  Cannon  teamed! 
up  with  Dave  Cutshall  of  Kansas! 
State  to  turn  in  a  time  of  6.2  se-; 
conds  which  was  good  enough; 
to  advance  them  to  the  short; 
round  competition.  j 

Dustin  Sheldon,  despite  not; 
placing,  also  turned  in  an  im-j 
pressive  performance  with  a  time 
of  13.3  seconds  in  the  steer! 
wrestling  event.  j 

"I  think  the  team  performed 
pretty  well  and  I  was  somewhat 
happy  with  my  performance," 
Cannon  said.  "I  feel  that  it's  just 
a  matter  of  getting  the  jitters  out 
of  our  system,  and  once  we  do 
that  we'll  be  fine."  j 

Jill  Taylor  put  in  a  strong  con; 
tribution  for  the  women  as  she 
placed  fifth  in  the  break  away 
event  by  finishing  with  a  time  of 
3.3  seconds.  Taylor  also  finished 
in  a  blazing  time  of  12.87  seconds 
in  the  barrel  racing  event  but  wafc 
hampered  by  a  five-second 
penalty  for  knocking  over  a  bar¬ 
rel  which  unabled  her  to  place^ 

"I  was  much  more  confident 
this  week  then  I  was  the  first 
time  out.  I  was  really  happy  with 
the  way  I  roped  in  the  break 
away  event.  I  just  wish  I  could 
have  sustained  the  performance 
in  the  short  round,"  Taylor  said.

The  Bearcat  and  Bearkitten  ten¬ 
nis  teams  won  four  of  their  five 
matches  as  they  hosted  the  John 
Byrd  Classic  over  the  weekend. 

The  Bearcat  tennis  team  has 
won  four  consecutive  dual 
matches  to  improve  their  record 
to  6-5,  while  the  Bearkittens  split 
their  matches  over  the  weekend. 

Leah  Erickson  improved  her 
record  to  9-0  on  the  season  with 
two  match  wins  over  the 
weekend.  She  was  named  the 
MIAA  Player  of  the  Week  for  her 
efforts. 

Erickson  has  been  an  impossi¬ 
ble  person  to  defeat  this  season. 
Not  only  is  she  undefeated,  but 
she  has  only  dropped  two  of  the 
20  sets  she  has  played  this  sea¬ 
son.  She  has  also  won  10  con¬ 
secutive  sets. 

The  Bearcats  blanked  Au-

doubles  matches. 

The  Bearcats  won  both  of  their 
matches  on  Saturday  with  wins 
over  Graceland  and  William 
Jewell.  Lucho  Orellana  defeated 
Graceland's  number  one  player 
by  scores  of  6-0  and  6-0. 

"Lucho  played  really  well," 
Tennis  Coach  Mark  Rosewell 
said.  "That's  the  best  tennis  I've 
seen  him  play  in  a  while." 

The  Bearkitten's  lost  their  only 
match  on  Saturday  against  the 
University  of  Northern  Iowa  5-4. 
Northwest's  Kara  Fritz  and  Leah 
Erickson  lost  a  close  third  dou¬ 


bles  match  against  Marcy  Daniel 
and  Laura  McElwain.  They  lost 
the  first  set  6-4  and  bounced  back 
in  the  second  with  a  6-3  win  to 
even  things  up.  The  final  set 
went  both  ways  before  Daniel 
and  McElwain  pulled  out  a  7-6 
victory  to  take  the  match. 

Both  tennis  teams  are  prepared 
to  make  their  mark  in  the  confer¬ 
ence  this  season,  according  to 
Rosewell. 

"I  think  we  will  make  a  strong 
showing  at  the  conference  and 
that's  our  goal,"  Rosewell  said. 
"I  think  we  are  playing  pretty 
well  at  this  point  and  we  keep 
improving."

Northwest  freshman  Diane 
Cummings  placed  in  three 
events,  including  a  first-place  fin¬ 
ish  in  the  high  jump  at  last 
weekend's  Southwest  Missouri 
State  Invitational  meet. 

Cummings  also  finished  4th  in 
the  triple  jump  and  6th  in  the 
long  jump. 

"She's  outstanding,"  Northwest 
assistant  track  coach  Mike  Rob¬ 
bins  said.  "She's  the  best  wom¬ 
an  track  athlete  at  Northwest." 

Cummings'  early  college  suc¬ 
cess  started  before  she  arrived  at 
Northwest,  according  to  Robbins. 

"She  has  a  good  high  school 
background  because  her  father  is 
a  coach."  Robbins  said.  "She  also 
works  hard." 

Northwest  received  another 
place  finish  from  Jenny  Sollars. 
Sollars  placed  4th  in  the  javelin. 

The  Bearcats  received  another 
solid  effort  from  senior  Ken  Onu¬ 
aguluchi.  Onuaguluchi  finished 
1st  in  the  discus  for  the  second 
straight  meet  and  also  placed  2nd 
in  the  shot  put. 

"He's  the  best  discus  thrower  in 
the  conference,"  Robbins  said. 

Northwest  received  double¬ 
placing  performances  from  Ken-

Robbins  is  optimistic  about  the 
men's  performances  this  spring. 
"Right  now,  the  men  are  proba¬

of  three  to  CMSU  Mules

The  Northwest  Bearcats  baseball  team  dropped  two  out  of 
three  over  the  weekend  in  their  triple-header  series  against  the 
Central  Missouri  State  Mules  on  Saturday  and  Sunday  at  the 
Bearcat  field  in  Maryville. 

Tire  Bearcats  won  the  first  game  11-10  on  Saturday,  but  lost 
the  remaining  two  games  3-2  and  19-5  on  Saturday  and  Sun¬ 
day,  respectively.  f  ■  ^4i i: 

The  'Catswere  trailing  7-0  after  three’ ^nd;  one-half  irmings,' 
but  a  base  hit  by  Todd  Bissell  gave  the  'Cats'theirfir^tTun  which' 
led  to  four  more  runs  in  the  fifth.  Wandrey  singled  in  Gary  Stick- 
ney  in  the  sixth  to  make  the  score  10-6. 

The  'Cats  eventually  got  the  lead  in  the  eighth  inning  with 
a  5-run  surge  that  consisted  of  Dave  Svehla's  2-run  double  and 
single  run  efforts  by  Bissell  and  Rick  Barthol. 

The  following  day  the  Mules  captured  the  victory  3-2  in  the 
bottom  of  the  tenth  with  a  solo  home  run  from  Todd  Schreifels. 

A  double  by  Central's  Brian  Wilmsmeyer  scored  the  first  run 
and  Kyle  McCune  evened  the  game  on  a  REl  single.  The  game 
remained  tied  until  the  middle  of  the  ninth  when  the  game  was 
called  off  due  to  darkness. 

The  game  resumed  the  following  day  with  the  'Cats  J.  McAr¬ 
thur  holding  the  Mules  scoreless  and  forcing  the  game  into  the 
tenth.  Nevertheless,  a  home  run  by  the  Mules  Todd  Schreifels 
got  the  victory. 

In  the  final  game  of  the  series,  the  Bearcats  were  annihilated 
19-5  by  the  relentless  Mule  bats. 

Northwest's  only  lead  came  in  the  first  inning  on  Dave  Sveh¬ 
la's  sacrifice  fly,  but  the  Mules  retaliated  with  a  19-run  explo¬ 
sion  over  6  innings  to  cap  the  victory. 

The  'Cats'  next  game  is  against  Washburn  for  a  three-game 
North  Division  series  in  Topeka  on  Friday. 

"We  want  to  go  there  and  take  three  from  them,  not  two,  we 
want  to  be  greedy,"  Johnson  said.  "The  longer  the  series  the  bet¬ 
ter  it  is  for  us,  we  have  a  lot  of  pitching  depth."

Hurdles  for  people 

\ 

who  are  handicapped 


m 


by  Pat  Schurkamp 
Features  Editor 


our-inch  curbs  without  ramps  become 
mountains  to  ascend,  three  stair  steps  be¬ 
come  endless  pits  to  descend  and  cracks  in 
the  sidewalks  become  caverns  that  make 
getting  around  the  campus  an  obstacle  course  for  people 
who  are  in  wheelchairs. 

Frustration.  For  10  hours  I  sat  in  a  wheelchair  trying 
1  to  make  my  way  around  a  non-acccssible  campus.  My 
firstclass  was  in  Colden  Hall  room  101 .  Starting  from  the 
office  of  the  Northwest  Missourian,  I  knew  exactly  how 
to  make  my  way  to  Colden. 

This  can't  be  too  hard,  I  thought.  All  I  had  to  do  was  go 
to  the  elevator  in  Wells,  go  to  the  first  floor,  then  use  the 
1  ramp  and  make  my  way  to  Colden. 

Wrong.  To  get  to  the  elevators  I  had  to  go  up  a  steep 
incline.  I  called  for  help.  Two  of  my  friends  assisted  in 
getting  me  up  the  ramp.  After  conquering  the  ramp,  the 
next  step  was  using  the  chair  lift.  Unfortunately,  I  had  no 
idea  how  it  worked.  After  several  minutes  of  struggling  to 
open  thedoorofthcchairlifl,  two  maintenance  men  came 
by  and  I  asked  if  they  knew  how  it  worked. 

Success.  Although  they  also  had  to  struggle  in  getting 
it  opened,  eventually  they  succeed  and  I  was  on  my  way 
to  Colden  Hall. 

Within  a  matter  of  a  few  minutes  of  wheeling  myself 
to  Colden  my  arms  began  to  ache,  the  palms  of  my  hands 
became  a  fiery  red  and  a  blister  formed  on  my  right 
thumb. 

Anger.  Pushing  with  all  my  strength  just  didn't  seem 
to  be  enough  to  get  me  to  Colden  Hall.  No  one  stopped  to 
see  if  they  could  help  me.  With  each  exasperating  turn  of 
the  wheel  I  couldfeel  th&anger  boiling  inside  of  me.  Did 
no  one  care?  Was  their  time  so  important  to  them  that  they 
couldn't  even  take  a  minute  to  sec  if  I  needed  help? 

Downhill.  As  I  turned  the  comer  to  make  my  way 
down  to  the  first  floor  of  Colden  I  encountered  a  slope  that 
was  all  downhill.  Strange,  I  thought,  I  had  walked  down 
this  minute  hill  hundreds  of  times  in  my  two  years  here, 
and  never  had  I  realized  just  how  steep  it  really  was. 
Sitting  at  the  top  of  the  slope  I  tried  to  figure  out  how  I  was 
going  to  get  down  itsafely.  Slowly  and  cautiously  I  pulled 
back  on  the  wheels  of  the  chair  and  made  my  descent. 
Thank  God,  I  sighed  as  I  hit  the  door  opener.  What  is 
normally  a  four  or  five  minute  walk  now  took  me  20 
minutes  in  the  wheelchair.  But,  I  had  made  it,  and  I  basked 
in  this  small  moment  of  glory.  (I  failed  to  realize  that  after 
class  I  would  have  to  ascend  the  slope  and  it  would  take 
all  the  energy  I  could  muster.) 

Help.  Class  was  over  and  once  again  the  slope  and  I 
confronted  each  other.  The  slope  was  no  longer  just 
cement  and  cracks,  but  a  fire-breathing  dragon  to  be 
conquered  by  the  crushing  metal  of  my  chair.  After 
several  attempts  at  climbing  the  hill,  I  realized  once  again 
I  was  going  to  have  to  ask  for  help.  I  have  never  been  a 
person  to  ask  for  a  lot  of  help,  but  I  found  out  quickly  that 
I  was  going  to  have  to  break  down  and  allow  others  to 
come  to  my  rescue. 

The  problem  was  that  people  still  tended  to  ignore  me 
or,  if  not  ignore  me,  give  looks  of  disdain  as  if  I  were  in 
their  way  or  a  freak  to  be  looked  at  as  though  I  were  part 
of  a  circus. 

Once  again,  my  two  friends  showed  up  to  give  me  aid. 
Up  the  slope  we  went,  slaying  the  fire-breathing  dragon. 

Hopeless.  I  had  only  been  in  the  wheelchair  for  two 
hours  and  I  was  already  beginning  to  feel  the  hopeless¬ 
ness  of  not  being  able  to  go  where  I  wanted  to.  "I  want  this 
to  be  over  with,"  I  thought.  But  then  I  realized  that  for 
thousands  of  people,  the  hopelessness  of  not  being  able  to 
go  where  they  wanted  or  to  feel  the  cool,  green  grass 
tickle  the  soles  of  their  feet  was  a  reality  they  had  to  deal 
with  all  of  their  lives,  not  just  for  10  hours. 


Determined.  I  decided  to  finish  what  I  had  started.  I 
had  to  understand  and  feel  the  frustration  of  every  bump, 
crack  and  slope  this  University  had  to  offer.  How  else 
could  I  begin  to  understand  the  frustration  of  being 
handicapped  in  a  society  made  for  the  non-handicapped? 

Plans.  Not  only  were  the  wheels  on  my  chair  rolling, 
but  so  were  the  wheels  in  my  head.  First,  I  had  to  make  a 
mental  picture  of  each  of  my  classrooms  and  decide  the 
best  avenues  of  attack  for  getting  to  them.  Second,  I 
would  schedule  my  leaving  for  classes  around  the  times 
that  my  friends  were  going  to  their  classes  so  I  could  ask 
for  help.  And  third,  I  would  not  give  up. 

Anger.  The  anger  continued  to  build  throughout  the 
day.  "Gee,  Pat,  you  sure  are  bossy  today,"  my  friends 
would  comment. 

They  were  right.  With  each  turn  of  the  wheel  my  anger 
grew.  I  was  angry  at  the  University,  I  was  angry  at  the 
people  who  stared,  and  I  was  angry  at  myself.  Why,  I  kept 
mumbling  all  day?  Why  would  the  state  not  give  the 
University  the  money  to  equip  the  campus  with  theproper 
facilites  for  people  with  disabilities?  I  didn't  care,  nor 
wanted  to hcaraboutgovemmcntcut-backs.  Somewhere, 
I  thought,  the  government  has  to  decide  what  is  more 
important  —  people  or  products. 

Society.  It  is  a  non-handicapped  world.  Those  people 
who  can  hear,  walk  and  sec  are  the  people  that  society 
smiles  upon.  They  are  the  blue-eyed,  blond-haired  people 
of  the  world. 

People  with  wheelchairs,  hearing  aids  and  walking 
canes  are  still  the  untouchables.  I,  too,  would  look  at  a 
person  with  disabilities  and  think,  oh,  what  a  shame.  But 
until  I  was  forced  to  sit  in  a  wheelchair  and  make  way 
around  campus  in  it,  I  had  never  had  the  empathy  needed 
to  understand  the  pain  and  frustration  of  being  handi¬ 
capped.  .  vv 

Frustation.  Frustration  upon  frustration,  anger  upon 
anger  continued  to  mount  as  the  day  grew  closer  to  an  end. 
My  journey  to  Garrett-Strong  was  even  more  frustrating 
than  the  one  to  Colden.  As  I  neared  Garrett-Strong  I  saw 
a  ramp  that  entered  to  the  front  of  the  building.  Thank 
goodness,  I  thought,  a  building  that  was  equipped  for  the 
disabled. 

But  my  joy  once  again  faded  into  more  frustration.  I 
made  it  up  the  ramp  and  inside  the  building  only  to  be 
confronted  by  three  sets  of  staircases.  Okay,  not  to  panic, 
I  told  myself.  I  saw  a  chair  lift  at  the  top  of  the  steps  and 
tried  to  figure  out  how  to  use  it.  It  was  different  than  the 
one  in  Wells  Hall.  I  couldn’t  figure  it  out.  Dr.  Ted 
Goudge,  associate  professor  of  the  geology/gcography 
department,  passed  by. 

"Dr.  Goudge,  do  you  know  how  to  operate  the  chair 
lift?,"  I  asked  him. 

Unfortunately,  he  told  me  I  needed  to  get  a  key.  To  get 
the  key  I  would  need  to  go  up  the  stairs.  But,  how  was  I 
going  to  do  that,  I  was  in  a  wheelchair. 

Dr.  Goudge  kindly  offered  to  carry  me  up  or  down  the 
stairs,  but  I  declined  and  decided  to  find  another  way  into 
Garrett-Strong. 

Regroup.  Back  outside  I  went  and  wheeled  around  to 
the  north  side  of  the  building.  Suddenly  the  sidewalk- 
camc  to  a  dead  stop.  There  was  no  ramp  to  descend.  A 
four-inch  drop  awaited  my  arrival.  That  was  it.  I  had  had 
it.  I  was  tired  of  my  arms  aching  from  the  constant 
pushing  of  my  wheelchair.  I  was  tired  of  the  palms  of  my 
hands  hurting  from  the  pressure  I  exerted  when  tugging 
at  the  wheels,  and  I  was  tired  of  not  being  able  to  go  where 
I  needed  to  go! 

But  once  again,  a  fellow  friend  came  to  my  aid.  As  I 
screamed  at  the  top  of  my  lungs  at  the  fear  of  being  pulled 
off  the  sidewalk  and  dumped  on  the  ground,  my  friend 
gently  lifted  me  down  from  the  curb  and  wheeled  me  into

Classes  were  over  and  it  was  now  5  p.m.  I  only  had  two 
more  hours  to  go.  With  each  passing  minute  I  became 
more  and  more  edgy.  I  needed  to  go  to  the  bathroom  but 


Barriers  still  remain;

Although  Northwest  is  not 
completely  in  compliance  with 
federal  regulations  regarding 
handicap  accessibiity,  Gerald 
Wright,  assistant  professor  of  spe¬ 
cial  education,  said  the  University 
has  made  a  lot  of  rides  recently  for 
people  with  disabilities. 

"I  think  everyone  on  campus  is 
aware  that  we  are  not  fully  ac¬ 
cessible.  We  never  had  a  group  try 
to  address  this  issue  and  make  the 
recommendations  necessary,"  he 


said.  "It's  mostly  been  a  hodge¬ 
podge  effort  of  when  a  student 
would  bring  forth  a  certain  prob¬ 
lem  it  would  be  dressed  in  some 
manner." 

Some  of  the  improvements 
Wright  commented  on  were  the 
installation  of  more  electric  door 
openers,  restroom  facilities  being 
made  more  wheelchair  accessible 
and  improved  handicap  parking. 

Wright  said  a  group  had  been 
formed  at  Northwest  to  help  ad¬ 
dress  the  issue  campus  accessi¬ 
bility. 

"The  group,  Committee  for 
Students  with  Disabilities,  is  ap¬ 
proximately  two  years  old.  Six  to 
eight  people  serve  on  the  commit¬ 
tee,”  he  said.  ;  ■v  -'Mr. 

The  committee  addresses  a  full 
spectrum  of  disabilities,  Wright 
said. 


"The  committee  addresses  stu¬ 
dents  who  are  wheelchair  bound, 
hearing  paired,  blind  or  have 
learning  disabilities.  We  encour¬ 
age  and  solicit  student  input  and 
would  like  to  have  more  students 
with  disabilities  serving  on  the 
committee,"  Wright  said. 

Dr.  Nancy  Riley,  who  serves 
as  chairperson  for  the  committee, 
also  said  at  she  has  seen  im¬ 
provements  made  in  accessibility 
at  the  University. 

"A  number  of  things  have  been 
done,"  she  said. 

Riley  commented  on  the  ramps, 
railings  and  elevators  that  have 
been  installed  in  the  past  few  years 
at  Northwest.

problems  that  the  disabled  studen  t 
must  face,  Riley  said,  and  acts

A  HAZARDOUS  HURDLE-  Stairs,  doorways,  bathroom  stalls,  even  cracks  in  the  sidewalk  become  almost  insurmountable 
hurdles  toa  person  bound  toa  wheelchair.  Wheelchairs  can  appear  menacing  and  threatening  to  the  non-handicapped,  foreport  >

was  afraid  of  how  it  was  going  to  work.  Everything  else 
I  had  planned  for  had  failed  and  using  the  restroom  was 
one  thing  I  had  no  idea  how  to  plan  for. 

I  wheeled  my  way  to  the  restroom  in  Wells  Hall.  But, 
once  again,  I  found  another  wall  to  dodge,  another  moun¬ 
tain  to  climb,  another  dragon  to  conquer. 

I  twisted  and  turned  trying  to  fit  die  chair  and  me  in  the 
bathroom  stall.  It  was  impossible.  1  finally  gave  up  and 
cheated  for  the  first  time  that  day.  1  walked  into  the  stall. 

After  I  finished,  1  questioned  whether  or  not  1  wanted 
to  gel  back  in  the  chair.  I  knew  there  was  still  one  more 
place  I  needed  to  conquer  —  die  Union. 

I  wheeled  myself  over  to  the  Deli  and  made  my  way 
through  the  line.  For  die  first  time  that  entire  day  a 
stranger  asked  if  she  could  help  me.  It  was  die  cashier. 
Thank  God,  someone  who  had  some  compassion  for  the 
position  I  was  in. 

"Thank  you  very  much,"  1  said.  "I  really  appreciate 
you  helping  me." 

It  was  nice  to  know  that  there  was  someone  who  cared 


enough  to  want  to  help  a  fellow  stranger.  Quickly,  my' 
smile  of  momentary  friendship  widi  diis  stranger  came  to ; 
an  end  when  I  noticed  dircc  oilier  students  silting  against 
the  wall  poindng  and  staring  at  me.  But  realizing  dial  the  ■ 
anger  I  was  feeling  toward  the  three  unknown  students  - 
would  only  dismiss  the  kindness  dial  the  cashier  had  - 
shown  for  me  if  I  conunucd  to  be  angry,  I  once  again, 
smiled  and  simply  turned  away  from  the  three  unknown 
students. 

Relief.  Finally  it  was  7  p.m.  Time  forme  to  once  again 
feel  the  sturdiness  of  my  legs  its  they  held  my  body  erect, 
to  feel  die  cold  concrete  under  my  feet  and  to  go  where  I 
needed  and  wanted  to  go. 

As  I  stood  up  I  realized  that  I  was  privileged.  I  could 
get  up,  but  thousands  of  other  people  were  forever  des¬ 
tined  to  the  fate  of  their  chair  and  the  limitations  put  on 
them  by  a  non-handicapped  society. 

I  could  push  the  wheelchair  away  from  my  legs  but  I 
could  never  push  it  away  from  my  memory. 

I  went  home  and  cried  tears  of  frustration. 


"Right  now,  the  committee  is 
focusing  on  the  availability  of 
services,"  Riley  said.  "We  arc 
working  with  students  and  in¬ 
structors." 

Rollic  Stadlman,  504  coordi¬ 
nator  for  Northwest,  said  that  fed¬ 
eral  law  mandates  that  an  institu¬ 
tion  accepts  federal  money  then  it 
must  comply  with  certain  guide¬ 
lines  set  forth  by  the  federal  gov¬ 
ernment. 

"The  guidelines  are  common 
sense  as  well  as  a  Christian  thing 
to  do,"  Stadlman  said. 

Stadlman  said  that  each  year 
the  University  asks  the  slate  gov¬ 
ernment  for  money  to  assist  in 
making  the  campus  handicap  ac¬ 
cessible. 

"Every  year  money  is  requested 
from  the  state,  but  in  the  last  couple 
years  we  have  not  received  the 


money  needed,"  he  said. 

Stadlman  said  the  elevator  re¬ 
cently  installed  in  Brown  Hall  was 
purchased  through  local  funds. 

"The  University  is  not  barrier 
free,  but  it  is  better  this  year  than 
it  was  last  year,  and  it  will  be 
better  next  year,"  Stadlman  said, 
Jill  Hawkins,  director  of  Cam¬ 
pus  Safely,  said  that  if  a  student 
was  disabled,  even  temporarily, 
they  could  get  a  permit  that  would 
allow  them  to  park  in  a  handicap 
parking  space.  1 

"The  penalty  for  parking  in  a 
handicap  space  is  $25.  Next  year 
that  fee  will  be  raised  to  $50.  It 
must  be  remembered  that  handi¬ 
cap  parking  is  reserved  for  dis¬ 
abled  drivers  24-hours,"  She  said. 
"Although  a  person  may  look  per  • 
feedy  healthy  they  may  have  some 
problem  that  is  internal." 


People  must  remember  to  look  beyond 
the  chair  to  tire  person  inside  it.  (Photo

From 
Left  Field 

k  by  Don  Carrick 


It  was  a  good  weekend  until 
Aunt  Edna  came  along.  I  had 
planned  for  48  hours  of  rest  and 
relaxation  when  my  mom  asked 
me  to  do  her  a  favor. 

"Is  there  cash  involved  in  this?" 
I  asked. 

"In  your  dreams,  pal,"  she  an¬ 
swered.  "I  need  you  to  go  shop¬ 
ping  in  Kansas  City  with  your 
Aunt  Edna  tomorrow." 

Now,  what  I  wanted  to  hear 
was,  "Don,  I  need  you  to  gel  up 
late  and  lounge  around  the  house 
all  day  and  for  this  service  I  will 
pay  you  $200."  But  what  she  said 
didn't  sound  anything  like  that.  It 
sounded  like  a  day  I'd  rather  spend 
buried  up  to  my  neck  in  sand  with 
the  hot  sun  beating  down  on  my 
head  until  I  go  crazy  and  think  I'm 
the  sixth  New  Kid  on  the  Block. 
(Being  the  second  Donny  in  the 
group,  I  believe  I  would  be  entitled 
to  barbeque  in  any  Holiday  Inn 
hotel  room  nationwide! !)  Actually 
the  favor  entailed  my  spending 
the  day  with  my  Aunt  Edna. 

Don't  get  me  wrong,  AuntEdna 
is  a  nice  person,. it's  just  that  she's 
a  bit  wrinkled  around  the  edges.  I 
believe  every  family  in  America 
has  an  Aunt  Edna.  The  aunt  that 
wears  the  loud  print  dresses.  The 
aunt  that  hasn't  changed  hairstyles 
for  26  years.  The  aunt  that  sends 
you  bow  ties  for  Christmas  and 
your  birthday,  even  after  you  turn 
20  years  old.  The  aunt  whose  sup¬ 
port  hose  are  always  around  her 
ankles.  You  get  the  picture. 

My  attitude  toward  my  Aunt 


Edna  made  it  hard  to  accept  my 
mother's  request,  but  after  a  little 
bargaining  and  a  kick  in  the  butt,  I 
was  swayed  to  go  to  what  I  like  to 
call,  "An  Excursion  to  Hell  and 
Points  South." 

I  got  up  good  and  early  the  next 
morning  and,  per  my  mom's  in¬ 
structions,  dressed  in  my  "Aunt 
Edna  Suit."  This  outfit  is  made  up 
of  every  pieccofclothing  my  Aunt 
Edna  ever  gave  me  and  makes  me 
look  like  the  star  of  the  new  movie 
"Night  of  the  Living  Geeks."  I  top 
off  the  ensemble  with  a  splash  of 
"Breaker  19"  the  cologne  Aunt 
Edna  gave  me  for  Christmas  1978. 
I  looked  at  myself  in  the  mirror 
with  anguish  and  self-pity.  It  was 
truly  a  dark  day  for  Don  Carrick. 

Aunt  Edna  picked  me  up  in  her 
'77  Nova  promptly  at  9  in  the 
morning.  She  was  an  early  riser 
and  liked  to  get  a  jump  on  things, 
plus  she  said  "all  the  hooligans 
will  be  off  the  street  after  their  all- 
night  partying." 

I  don't  know,  that  sounded 
pretty  good  to  me,  better  than 
spending  two  hours  on  the  road 
with  your  Aunt  Edna.  Ofcoursc.it 
never  is  two  hours  with  Edna,  more 
like  three  of  four,  because  every 
time  her  odometer  reaches  55  she 
screams  the  worst  words  you'll 
ever  hear  her  utter,  "Oh  my 
goodness!"  and  slams  the  needle 
back  down  to  a  reasonable  35  miles 
per  hour.  This  not  only  turns  her 
into  a  highway  hazard,  but  also 
moves  us  along  at  the  speed  of  the 
ice  flows. 

Edna  had  plans  for  the  day,  big 
plans,  and  it  was  up  to  me  to  make 
sure  they  did  not  go  unfulfilled. 
My  job  description  on  that  day 
was  to  guard  Aunt  Edna  and  her 
45-pound  purse  from  what  she 
called  the  "dregs  of  humanity" 


and  to  carry  all  her  packages.  It 
was  a  dirty  job  and  no  one  should 
have  to  do  it,  but  I  was  bom  under 
a  bad  moon  and  so  fate  shouldered 
me  with  the  burden.  I  was  treated 
to  a  day  of  toting  around  bags  that, 
had  lady  luck  not  smiled  upon  me, 
could  have  caused  a  major  hernia. 
Edna  sometimes  broke  the  mo¬ 
notony  by  pointing  at  people  and 
whispering,  "Look  Don,  drug 
dealers!  You  can  tell  by  the  look 
in  their  eye!" 

On  the  way  home  Aunt  Edna 
treated  me  to  dinner.  I  was  still 
trying  to  pull  my  arms  back  into 
joint  after  carrying  her  packages 
and  was  hoping  to  get  home  before 
dark  so  the  day  wouldn't  be  totally 
wasted,  so  I  tried  to  beg  off.  Edna 
insisted,  "Donald  Christopher 
Carrick,  if  you  don't  eat  a  well 
balanced  meal  you'll  starve  and 
die!" 

Knowing  that  arguing  was 
pointless,  I  agreed  and  she  pulled 
into  a  family-style  buffet  restau¬ 
rant.  During  the  meal  I  decided  to 
go  get  seconds.  Aunt  Edna 
grabbed  my  arm.  "Don’t  leave 
yourdrinkonthetable.Don.  While 
you're  gone  someone  might  come 
along  and  drop  LSD  in  it." 

I  found  myself  hoping  that 
somehow  the  gene  that  affected 
my  Aunt  Edna  had  not  skipped  a 
generation  and  I  would  never  sec 
my  future  children  covering  their 
drinks  with  suspicious  looks  in 
their  eyes. 

Blessedly,  the  ride  home  was 
uneventful.  As  we  pulled  into  my 
driveway,  Aunt  Edna  said,  "Oh 
Don,  I  had  such  a  lovely  time 
today.  We  really  should  do  this 
again  sometime!" 

Yeah,  right.  As  my  motheroncc 
said,  "In  your  dreams  pal.”
