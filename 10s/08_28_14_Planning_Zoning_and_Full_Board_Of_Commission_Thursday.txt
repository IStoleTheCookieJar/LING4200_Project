agenda if an item is not set aside all items on the agenda will be voted on by
a single vote following the recommendation of the Planning Commission
Commissioner Walker I'm asking that item the ordinance amendment be set aside at
this point I'm not sure whether I'm going to ask that it be tabled or whether
it be sent back to planning but it will involve requesting revisions between
legal and myself that did not make it to this version okay item d1 is set aside
are there others move for approval second all right it has been moved and
seconded for the consent agenda let the record show that no one else is moving
forward to setting an item aside we will now consider all the consent agenda
items together roll call with the exception of the set aside roll call
Philbrook aye Walker aye Townsend aye McKiernan aye McGee yeah Maddox aye
Kane Markley aye the vote is eight to zero the motion carries all right thank
you very much that brings us to item d1 mr. Walker do you have a
recommendation of action you'd like to see can you speak directly into the
microphone please sir d1 is was designed to permit the placement of what are
called electronic digital billboards and that's the ones that change prescribed
intervals and it was designed also to eliminate the least some of the blighted
neighborhood neighborhood billboards by for each
billboard that was approved twice that billboard face surface would have to be
removed elsewhere now obviously there are plenty of billboards that litter
the urban core that are old-style and probably not very profitable and that
will never be removed unless there is an incentive to do so and so between
myself and legal there is to be a determination of how that incentive is
achieved I will also be looking for input from at least the major billboard
companies as to what their thoughts and concerns are on this it's going to have
to go back to planning because there's going to be substantive changes made so
I'm hoping to have those in time to send that back to the point I'm gonna make
September 8
you have to give notice of this on this case the notice has been published in
the echo and your actions can constitute the continued notice on that so we don't
have to republish or we don't have to give notice to anyone but we do need the
information Wednesday the week before so that we can incorporate at the packet
the planning Commission so that would be sometime September 5th or 4th or 5th
we're coming up on a holiday weekend with Monday off that's next Wednesday
next Wednesdays it would be the third yeah I'm sorry well we will get it on
we will send it back to planning I'm requesting that we send it back to
planning and zoning as soon as the revisions are made so if it doesn't make
it this month it will go back in October well we will put on this month's
agenda and then hold it over if need be to continue to notice thank you is there
a second it's been moved and seconded commissioner Gia we are just having
additional comment to Commissioner Walker in regard to his initiative on
the sign ordinance first of all thank you very much I really appreciate it
and I couldn't be more supportive of the changes I'd my one comment is that
recently I was involved in a variance for for signage that I was not convinced
was really necessary I what I'd like to see moving forward and I surely don't
want to slow the process for the electronic signage but I'd like to see
more professional discretion given to our staff about our signage in the
future the example is several lawyers and architects were paid a lot of money
to hold a community meeting in regard to the new Walmart where all they wanted to
do was add the word pharmacy on the front of the building that's it to let
people know that there's going to be a pharmacy on the side of the building
it's really not a good use of time of anybody's to spend on that level of
detail and it surely didn't need to you know cost the development that much more
money so it's just really feedback and I just wanted to make sure it was out
there not that staff did anything wrong you absolutely followed our policy and
we greatly appreciate that and not that the developer did anything wrong I just
would like to see things move a little more efficiently. Commissioner Walker.
I think that we anxiously await this review of our planning and zoning
ordinances and the opportunity to simplify if you want to call it be
business friendly be business friendly and eliminate those kind of examples
from requiring I mean every every requirement we impose on a developer or
businessman cost money and the problem is is that not everybody has the money
to spare so I'm I've been waiting and I'll continue to wait to hear when we
will initiate this this study because I have a feeling there's several of us
that have input we want to make on changes that we're gonna we're gonna
thank you thank you all right we need a roll call vote on sending this back to
the planning and zoning seeing no further comments roll call. Roll call.
Philbrook. Aye. Walker. Aye. Townsend. Aye. McKiernan. Aye. Merguia. Aye. Maddox. Aye. Kane. Aye.
Markley. Aye. The motion carries 8-0. Thank you that concludes our planning and
zoning agenda for tonight that bring no it doesn't that was wishful thinking we
have one item on planning and zoning thank you one item on non consent
agenda for planning and zoning and that is a plan review application PR 2014
18 I will ask mr. Richardson to make preliminary introduction to this and
then we'll have the proposer come forward and make presentation thank you
mr. mayor this is probably it's I know it's the first time since I've been here
that we've had a case that was approved unanimously in part and approved but
with a split vote in part you've already approved both the change of zone and the
master plan amendment for this case however there was a little bit of
discussion about the site plan as it related to the case and the uses of the
use of a tower crane and the reduction of some of the trees on the site
Kurt Peterson with Postonelli is here to represent the applicant and I'll let him
take it from there thank you
good evening mr. mayor Kurt Peterson with the Poulsen only law firm six two
zero one College Boulevard in Overland Park here on behalf of J.E. Dunn and with
me is our is the operations director for Dunn for this facility Patrick lease
as well as our engineer from Luch and Scott Cargill I knowing there are other
items that will fill the time tonight on the agenda I will attempt to be brief
and then know that we can take as much time as you want we can drill down in
the details this is a logistics facility J.E. Dunn hopes to make its entrance into
our state with this facility we'll bring a lot of jobs upwards of 50 million
dollars of investment as you can see on the screen it's located at the
northwest corner of K-32 and 65th Street the site would be divided roughly in
half it would have on with one building the site would have a crane rental tower
crane rental facility on the west hand side west side on the other side it
would have a equipment rental facility for contractors the building would be
generally serving both right down the middle the two the two different
operations as mr. Richardson said there is a tower crane that would be located
in the western half the site that's a very very can't underscore very enough
important part of this whole location to Kansas was a ability to have a tower
crane for the efficiency it offers as opposed to just having mobile cranes
again keeping it short there are mobile cranes still involved because two things
happen we get very very busy at times and you have to have multiple cranes
going on the site to be able to load the crane pieces and get them out to the job
sites and then unfortunately multiple times a year you do have the tower
crane go down again you need to have your mobile cranes working mobile cranes
because they have to be able to lift 40,000 pounds of load and because just
physics they have to have a tall boom because you you know it'll tip over the
mobile crane part if it's if it's has a tall boom and it's trying to lift 40,000
pounds and it's at a tight angle so you have to be very straight up and down
which means your tower crane has to be tall you put all that together and a
very important part of the site is having a tower crane of at least minimum
140 feet which is what we've asked for this application so with that there's
certainly more details mr. mayor but that I think would summarize where we've
been with the Planning Commission and getting their recommendation and coming
before you today happy to answer any questions you might have with
Commission all right I will first start with commissioners if commissioners have
any questions of the applicant and after the commissioners comments or questions
we will open the public hearing but are there any commissioners who wish to
comment at this time Commissioner McKiernan just curious did the the
concern of the discussion about this tower crane come up in one of the
Planning Commission meetings because as I look back through it I was trying to
look for what prompted this to come off of consent do you remember the date of
the meeting it will on which this discussion occurred
commissioner on August 13th this item was on the Planning Commission agenda
please speak directly into the microphone there were three motions that
night and there was discussion of the crane from the neighbor some of it
didn't make the record because it was stated from the audience and but there
was a at least one vote against the preliminary site plan that it was
approved I believe eight to one or seven to one to move forward seven to one
thank you any other further questions Commissioner McKiernan no thank you
Commissioner Philbrook yes I was present during that meeting and the major
concern was the reduction of the trees and the height of the boom and whether
it would be in the way of their viewing after back porch and I think that was
about it thank you any other commissioners with questions or comments
you'll have another opportunity I'd just like to do this preliminarily before we
open the planning and zoning public hearing seeing no further comments at
this time I'd like to open the public hearing if you would like to speak
anyone present would like to speak we would ask that you step to the podium
give us your name and address for the record you'll give be given three
minutes to make your comments I will ask for those who would like to speak in
favor of the proposal to step forward first is there anyone who would like to
speak in favor of this proposal to come to the microphone at this time let the
record show I see no one here to speak in favor of the proposal is there anyone
who would like to speak in opposition to the proposal I'd invite you to please
come to the microphone at this time
move for approval second let the record show no one moved forward to speak in
opposition we will close the public hearing it is now properly moved and
seconded seeing no further comments roll call roll call
Filbert aye Walker aye Townsend aye McKiernan aye Regia aye Maddox aye

roll call Philbrook I Walker I Townsend I mckiernan I regia I Maddox I Kane
Mark Lee I motion carries 8 to 0 that brings us now to our public hearing
agenda a public hearing for an ordinance and resolution regarding Vacation
Village Star District I'll turn this over to you administrator Bach for
initial presentation thank you mayor Commission tonight we're excited to
bring forward the first steps or later steps I guess in the process for
amendment to the Vacation Village Development District as well as
consideration of an agreement with Slitterbond regarding this development
this event tonight kind of cumulates from and July announcement when the
governor and the mayor announced along with Sporting Kansas City the intent of
soccer to bring their national training headquarters to our community we have
since moved forward with a meeting on August 4th before the standing
committee to which staff presented terms and such it would be set forth as to how
we would amend our development area and within that development area it does
extend and change some of the locations within it and extends over the Village
West area can assure everyone as questions have asked that there is
nothing within this proposal that does anything to extend the current terms of
our Village West area and that those bonds will continue to be paid off as
they currently are they could just contemplate new uses that could come
into this area but that meeting went forth on August 4th where those terms
were set out the public was there involved to go through the issues we've
been working on this in coordination with the governor's office as well as
the Secretary of Commerce as to how all the different components of this deal
could come together as it relates to the local level and where the state's role
would come into play as this as well so tonight I'm going to ask our economic
development director George Bracovitch to come forward and he's going to
present the major deal points surrounding this deal and it will be
followed by Todd LaSalle who's a counsel for the unified government that works
with us he'll go through other deal points that were presented to the
Commission and also as they pertain to this development agreement that is
before you tonight we'll also hear comments from Richard
Napier who's with the Sutter bond group and Rob Heineman who is here from
sporting Kansas City after such time if there are questions by the Commission
then we would move to a public hearing regarding this matter and then afterward
we'd look for action regarding adoption to the amend the plan that is being
presented and then consideration of the development agreement that is also being
presented so with that I'll recognize mr. Bracovitch to come forward and our
presentation thank you mr. Bach mayor commissioners good evening George
Bracovitch with economic development get this slideshow started as mr. Bach
mentioned my role tonight is just kind of lay out some of the parameters around
the two items that are up for public hearing and then to do kind of a brief
overview of some of the deal points in the proposed development agreement
that's been negotiated with the SBB 1 LLC the Schlitter bond development site
before we kind of jump into what we're doing here tonight I thought it'd be
beneficial to go and just revisit some of the previous action we've had on this
item in early July the developer submitted an amended district plan for
the district as well as project plans for what will be areas project areas one
two and four of the district and then subsequently on July 14th Planning
Commission had to make a conformance finding that those project plans do
indeed conform to the master plan and that meeting was held here and those
findings were made and then it's hard to believe but over a month ago on on
July 23rd there was an announcement with our partners that on goal about the US
soccer national training facility being built here in Kansas City the governor
made a presentation as well as the mayor and various other state and local
officials were also at that event then July 24th full commission actually
approved a resolution that set the public hearing date for tonight and I
can ensure you all that we followed all the statutory guidelines in terms of
certified mailings and publication notices so we are here officially and
then as mr. Bach mentioned August 4th we took this project we did not have the
full development agreement done but we had an executive summary and really the
summary deal points that you'll see here tonight pretty much in the exact same
form for that meeting but here we are tonight so what are we doing two public
hearings one on the expanded and amended district and then secondly public hearing
for the project plans again for areas one two and four and then there's an
ordinance that would approve both of those separately there's a resolution
for your consideration that would authorize the mayor to execute the
development agreement if you see so fit and again that development agreement is
with SVV one and covers project areas one two three and five we anticipate
having a development agreement structured with u.s. soccer or with on
goal for their project related to the u.s. soccer facility at a future date so
the original vacation village star district again bound by parallel on the
north state Avenue on the south 94th on the east and I 435 on the west one large
contiguous area the proposed amended and expanded district if you look at the
centerpiece here is the exact same district just divided into separate
project areas project area one and I'm going to go through these project areas
fairly briefly because mr. La Sala has a much more detailed explanation but
project area one for all intents and purposes is the existing water park
project area two is proposed autoplex with hotel pad sites and restaurant pet
sites project area three would be this green area kind of front 50 59 acre site
future plan for retail development and possible office use project area four is
the purple area and again this is the property that schiller bond is putting
into the mix for the u.s. soccer national training facility it also has
an overlay that goes back into the village west area but as mr. Bach said
earlier it does not use any of the existing base sales tax numbers there it
would be planned future increment off that site and as well as putting in a
new 127 acre site on the east side of 94th Street into play for soccer fields
as well youth soccer fields and then the blue area project area five is for future
water park expansion and lodging some of the we wanted to put this slide up to to
show really the magnitude of the total project investment going into the area
so between the land acquisition and and the water park we know that there's some
existing costs that have been incurred by the developer and then we know there's
future costs or estimated future costs to finish this project out so looking at
the the costs that have been incurred to date you know we're over 220 million
looking at what this project is projected to cost at completion we're
looking at somewhere near 660 million dollars so part of the project then and
what we're here for tonight in part with the development agreement is to consider
star bond financing for project areas 1 & 2 again we are contemplating that there
could be a 90 million cap proceeds available up to 90 million dollars again
subject to market constraints and Lou Levin's here tonight and he's much more
qualified to discuss what those market constraints might be but of note 5.4
million is the outstanding debt on what the UG issued to get 98th Street
reconstructed so of this bond issuance 5.4 million would be made available to
repay that debt additionally there will be proceeds made available to pay for a
new traffic signal at 98th Street as well as the the monies that were
advanced by water pollution to put in the Marshall Creek sewer interceptor so
what's contemplated from the UG share on this is that the debt backing on the
future star bond issuance is coming really from it well it's only limited to
the sales tax and the transient guest tax that's pledged to the project and so
we wanted to be emphatic in pointing out that there's no UG general funds or any
other backing by the UG for this project wanted to just kind of dive in can I
jump in that yeah the no the no general obligation backing is consistent with
all other star bond districts that we've had the unified government has never
backed in general obligation star bond projects is that right that is correct
mayor thank you just wanted to dive in a little bit into more detail about what
the UG pledge is and then talk a little bit about what are the revenue streams
that we retain in this project so pledge to the project is the 1% of our city
sales tax it's the UG share of county sales tax and then again the transient
guest or the hotel guest tax what we retain are the EMS plus the dedicated
sales tax and property tax and so what we're trying to shoot show with this
slide is just looking at project area to what kind of annual revenue stream is
generated by this project so we know the sales tax will be diverted to help
offset the debt but at full build out the UG share of the annual sales tax
retained are estimated at 1.5 million we also think that this project will
introduce about 42 million dollar 42 million in new appraised value via the
the projects that are being put in place and again loose staff calculated that
the UG portion of that is roughly 800 so we're thinking approximately a total
annual impact of 2.3 million from this project that will be retained locally
Commissioner Walker do you have something related to this slide yes I do
and again can you please speak directly in the microphone for the people at home
mr. Brakovich you you're indicating that this full build out this portion of the
project will have an appraised value of 42 million are there guarantees in the
document that they've accepted that as the appraised value for real estate
taxation purposes there are not guarantees of that nature this is
looking at existing projects that we have and and I hate to speak for Lou his
staff put this together but as we discussed it earlier today we feel these
are actually conservative estimates based on existing values you know we've
had a lot of projects built out there that have been proclaimed on the front
end to have a certain value at build out and then as it has come time to pay the
tax man these buildings for one or more reasons have a peculiarity about them or
a bond covenant or some of the restrictions that lawyers then argue
makes that 42 million dollar building worth ten cents and I am I am
increasingly concerned about the representations in new projects of what
it's going to pay out in taxes and then it does not occur when it comes time for
those taxes to be so I to what extent we can get a commitment as to I mean
normally you take a house I build a new house and I pay 250 for that house
that's what the tax man is going to charge me however when we look at
various projects we have not had that successful cost of bill be the be the
assessed value and so if you're going to represent this is a 42 portion is 42
million at build out I would hope there is something that will guarantee that
to be the fact when it comes time to start paying taxes on this property so
noted Commissioner I guess maybe just one quick note to that on that previous
slide where we showed projected cost to complete this project I'd note that for
area 2 if we just looked at the autoplex and the hotel restaurant pad
development that's a projected completion cost of over a hundred million
dollars and so you know coming to a value of 42 million again it's just
trying to highlight that we looked at existing projects and tried to come up
with a real number to avoid doing is setting any sort of false expectations
excellent point Commissioner thank you moving on with some of the additional
deal points related to the development agreement we talked in that earlier
slide of bond proceeds being made available up to 90 million and so we've
we've we've heard the Commission's direction in the past on projects where
we really wanted to insert some performance criteria and let's say not
just make all the funds available all at once so under that direction we came up
with this idea of a 25 million dollar hold back provision that laid out some
additional performance criteria on the on the developer and so it's really a
release of that 25 million in two tiers the first tier would be the developer
would be eligible to receive 15 million of that 25 million dollar hold back when
they do two things one is execute a ground lease to provide ground or to
on-goal for the US soccer project and secondly they clean up rough grade and
seed the 50 to 59 acres in project area 3 so right now there's there's some hills
there mounds there's still some construction and they've done a great
job recently to clean it up from what it looked like in years past but this is a
firm commitment to get that really cleaned up and graded and secondly that
second tier would be an additional release of that last 10 million hold back
if they do one of these two things the UG is able to have a unconditional fully
executed agreement with US soccer for project area 4 or the developer timely
commences with the initial phases of project area 3 and again project area 3
anticipates up to 400,000 square feet of new commercial retail or a mix of office
in there that would also reduce the total square footage other key deal
points within the auto mall complex itself there's two dealerships that were
former Wyandotte County businesses a Chrysler and a Ford due to market
pressures by the manufacturers those two facilities were not able to expand to
meet the needs of the manufacturer and so those points of sale were on the
market and there was a real threat to move those dealerships outside of our
county and so the developer group wanted to shore that up and help or
assist to keep those dealerships within our community but we also wanted to
acknowledge that they were here previously and make an attempt to
capture any base sales that they were generating so although the
manufacturers labeled them as under performers and whatnot they were still
generating a sales tax and so within this agreement is a provision to to
indeed capture that base sales tax a quick note about the star calendar again
we talked about this a little bit at standing committee you know star
projects are just like TIFF's you know in TIFF you create a district but your
calendar doesn't start ticking down until you approve the plan same thing
here but the thought is for project area one which is the existing water park
leave that clock going as it is so they've already they're eight years down
the road on that one so of the 20-year term it has 12 years left however for
all these other project areas where we're creating a new project area and
there's a new project plan submitted it's contemplated that each of those
would have that full 20-year term additional developer improvements
include improving the condition of the temporary intersection at their existing
location which is on the north side of State Avenue or the entrance to their
location on the north side of State Avenue as well as the st. Pat's Church
parking lot entrance and they've agreed to do that this project also includes
sidewalks and there is a very detailed exhibit within the development
agreement that really spells out what the sidewalks look like from parallel to
State Avenue along 98th Street and so on and then the s-curve portion of 98th
Street so for those of you that are familiar with 98th Street now it comes
to a T intersection at France Family that's not what was contemplated in the
long-term planning there and so we're trying to address through the
development agreement ensuring that that s-curve gets put in place per the
direction of public works and planning staff the CID portion of this some of
you probably recall this in 2013 we established a pay-as-you-go 2% sales
tax add-on CID part of that CID ensured that the UG would be repaid for its
traffic signal and that Marshall Creek sewer interceptor before any proceeds
were made available to the developer since those two items will be paid from
that initial bond proceeding we're agreeing to just transfer that pay-as-you-go
CID to the developer where that's what we're proposing and then on project
area 3 we talked about in that previous slide the to timely commence the
construction really comes down to there is a five-year period for the developer
to initiate significant development on that site or the UG gets an option on
the on the property and again mr. LaSalle will have some more details on
that and then finally we when we originally negotiated the agreement with
SVP prevailing wage was still in our tool belts and so we asked them to to
honor that original commitment and they have so any part of this project that's
going to be constructed by SVP will fall under prevailing wage provisions and
they've agreed to LMW participation goals on both the construction and
professional services component of this project very big deal donations again
the original agreement contemplated donations made by the developer to not
for profit those payments have never been made and so the rolling balance or
the balance do I guess is 750,000 so the agreement is that they would pay that at
the time of the bond issuance and what we've agreed to is kind of start over
with the schedule and so what the schedule always contemplated is the
donation started a hundred thousand dollar level it had an annual incremental
increase of twenty five thousand up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars and
so if the commitment is there to pay the 750 now we'll restart that calendar
Commissioner Kane don't take that slide off there three things you said if the
mayor approves this I'm sorry if I did it was a I sign it on your behalf but
only if you approve it okay correct can't sign anything you don't approve I'm
gonna let that go I misspoke I'm sorry the first of all I want if we pass this
I want this on our website tomorrow morning you know and it's huge and I
really appreciate it I think the folks that work and live and build this type
of stuff are going to appreciate it and the fact that those license plates will
be from Kansas and Missouri and not from somewhere else I think this is
outstanding and one other thing you know we said we involved the state and which
is great but I think we need to involve like the state reps that are in that
area not just the ones in the Topeka the ones that live here with us the ones
that have worked on Starbunds before
state rep Burroughs is here so when we're having some meetings I think we need to
involve those folks as well so they know what's going on as well as we know
what's going on you know and I think that's that's something that that we
need to bring up and I think will be appreciated from everybody but I want
you to know that that is just short outstanding considering what's happened
from the state and I can't say how much I appreciate that and then this is back
to the proposed star district so I'll turn this over to mr. LaSalle good
evening mayor commissioners George is a nice job of giving you an overview I'm
going to go into slightly more detail about certain aspects of the development
agreement that you have before you I'm going to work through the executive
summary that we prepared about the document and for those who saw this same
executive summary in these same deal points in the economic development and
finance committee I will highlight a few differences some things that have
changed as the deal has evolved over the course of the last month what you have
before you is actually an amended and a restated development agreement that
really sort of cat the nature of this agreement sort of captures the fact that
the original agreement was was written and approved by you in 2006 it's been
amended six times and so the document hat you have before you incorporates all
six of those amendments and creates one single document that has all the terms
and conditions between you and this developer as mr. Brackovich said there
there are now five separate and distinct project areas that have been created
within the original Schlitterbahn site the project area one the area that is
peach colored if you will on on that map is really the existing water park site
the contract the development agreement does not require additional
improvements to the water park there probably will be improvements but there
are no contractual requirements to continue to expand and grow the water
park the document also provides for additional retail lodging and other
opportunities within that project area but contractually their obligations
relative to project area one as of today have been met project area two is a lot
of the focus of this document because it really captures the auto mall project
with some retail and some pad sites there are four somewhere between four
and seven auto dealerships that are contemplated in project area to the
yellow area on that map that area also includes two restaurant pad sites a
convenience store gas station location a C store all of that would be west of
94th Street and then there are also additional pad sites probably
restaurants and a 150 room extended stay hotel all of those projects still within
area two would be located west of 94th Street those projects are probably
related to the u.s. soccer facility that would be built just east of that and so
the timing for those projects probably conforms to when and if u.s. soccer were
to come to that site the deadlines relative to this auto plaza portion of
the project are that the developer is really supposed to start work on those
auto plaza projects by December 31st of this year and then complete at
least four auto dealerships in project area two by December 31st of 2016 the
rest of the project within area to that yellow area should be completed by
December 31st of 2017 so that's really the timing for that part of the project
project area three the area that is shown in green on that map is a
four hundred thousand square foot retail facility this part of the project
carries over from the original development agreement and it was also a
four hundred thousand square foot retail facility in the original deal as well
the UG is requiring that commencement of that part of the project the retail
facility start by September 1st of 2019 and it is contemplated that it will be
developed in phases over time with a completion date of the entire thing by
September 1st of two thousand and second 2022 George I think touched on
this but it is also a possibility that there will be an office component of
that project more specifically there would be there's the potential for a
new to Kansas office headquarters to choose this area project area three to
locate 300 or more than 300 new jobs in a headquarters facility and they're
very high-paying jobs jobs that would have over 200% of the average wage in
Wyandotte County right now if that happens in that green area there's
obviously less room to develop the 400,000 square foot retail facility so
if that if that happens on between 12 and 13 acres of that site the
obligation of the developer is to create a two hundred and seventy five
thousand square foot facility as opposed to 400 to sort of recognize the land
that would be put into that deal if that office headquarters comes there are also
certain changes that will occur in the financing structure and I'll touch on
that a little bit later project area four on that map the area that's in purple
is really is really the US soccer facility deal that is being contemplated
and worked on right now as George said this developer is not charged with
completing that part of the project that is probably separate agreements that
would come before you later that would be between the UG and on goal the
developer of the sporting park that part of the project would also include the
tournament fields concept perhaps some fields in the purple area that's in the
original Schlitterbahn development as well as a portion of the tournament
fields complex complex east of 98th Street on that new ground that would be
added added to the district the commencement dates and completion dates
for that facility would be agreed upon later and would come before you for
approval to later date and as George touched on it the blue areas project
area five there's not a lot of specificity about what would happen in
that area but it would come before you potentially later and has the ability to
be probably lodging facilities in the future Mr. Brakovich did a nice job of
summarizing the budget for you there is approximately 220 million dollars that
has already been invested into this site including about 82 million dollars in
design and construction costs and 81 million dollars in land acquisition the
new projects that are contemplated and covered by this agreement are include
about a hundred and fifteen million dollars of new capital investment in
this site for the auto plaza and the retail portion of the project in project
area two as well as perhaps a hundred and eighty seven million dollars for the
retail facility that would appear in project area three so again up to six
hundred and forty million dollars worth of total investment in this site there
is a star bond issuance that is in the in the near horizon that is expected by
the development agreement it would really be for the autoplex complex
that's in project area two as well as the water part that original star bond
issue would be approximately 90 million dollars it's really capped at net star
bond proceeds of 90 million dollars as George highlighted the U.G. would get
some money right off the top of that 90 million dollar issue to reimburse itself
for some infrastructure costs that the U.G. already has into this project five
point four million dollars would be for a note for a temporary note that exists
for the improvements the U.G. has already made to 98th Street as well as
about two hundred seventy five thousand dollars for a new traffic signal at 98th
and six hundred and sixty five thousand dollars for the remaining costs of a
previously constructed sewer interceptor and lift station for the Marshall Creek
sewer interceptor George also touched on this but there is a whole back portion
of that 90 million dollars in other words the developer does not receive all
of that money right away there are performance milestones that must be
achieved to get that 25 million dollars if you're the developer the first piece
of that is a 15 million dollar hold back that in order to get that money the
developer has to do two things one they have to reach a lease an agreement with
on goal about the US soccer facility and provide that ground for free the second
thing that they have to do is really clean up and rough grade that green area
that's on this map there is some construction and some equipment all of
that has to be removed and that site has to be rough graded to get the 15 million
dollars then to get the last 10 million dollars of the 25 the developer has to
do one of really three things either have a have a conclusive unconditional
agreement reached between the U.G. and US soccer to commence work on the
footings and foundations for project area three the retail site and they have
to they have to start I think it's at least a hundred seventy five thousand
square feet of footings and foundations or three have us reach an unconditional
agreement with that office headquarters project that could potentially land in
project area three if any of those three things happen that ten million dollars
of the hold back would be released and the developer would have access to that
money as George touched on there are two of the auto plaza concepts that would
potentially land in project area to formally existed in Wyandotte County
under prior ownership they but the developer has agreed that for those two
auto dealers we would have a fifteen point five million dollar base only new
sales above fifteen point five million dollars would be allowed to benefit
this project the other portion of that sales the fifteen point five would be
captured and distributed to the taxing jurisdictions largely the way it was
before for the county portion of that money it would be distributed exactly the
same way and for the city portion of that money it would be evenly split
between Bonner and Edwardsville and it's really to protect those existing that
existing those existing base sales there are also to touch on the timing
again for the project areas you really have a 20-year life for each of these
areas and so for the original water park part of the project that was approved in
2007 that plan was since it was approved in 2007 that star bond district really
ends and closes down in two thousand and twenty seven for the new area the
project plan you'd approve relative to the water part or to the auto plaza
tonight since that would happen in 14 that district would live until two
thousand and thirty four and if we come before you later with great projects for
project area three it would be 20 years from whenever you approve that project
plan an additional word or two about the changes that would happen if the office
project lands in project area three there are some changes to the financing
structure that are important and worth noting as George mentioned the developer
has responsibility for that s-curve that you see that touches France family drive
if if that happens if the office comes the the responsibility for those costs
really shifts from the developer to the unified government same is true for the
five point four million dollar note we spoke of for 98th Street those costs
shift to the unified government side of the ledger however the agreement
contemplates that we have to reach the unified government has to reach an
agreement with the state about how those costs would be covered you could grow
the size of the star bond issue or find other ways to resolve that but unless
and until the unified government reaches agreement with the state about how those
costs would be covered those those obligations are completely conditional
but I wanted to point it out because it is a change that occurs if the office
project selects this site and you decide to make a deal with that office
developer to land at this location there are industrial revenue bonds that are
contemplated as part of the financing structure here importantly they are not
revenue IRBs that are designed to abate property taxes they are purely to abate
the sales taxes on construction materials George mentioned some of the
developer improvements it's important to note that all the infrastructure
improvements related to this development will be paid for and the
responsibility for those resides with the developer specifically the developer
agrees to handle that s-curve that we keep talking about unless the office
project selects this site there are also in intersection improvements that will
happen along State Avenue including new drives for st. Patrick's and there are
very specific agreements in this development agreement about sidewalk
systems that would be provided within the project there are also two escrow
that would be provided that are important one is an escrow for taxes to
make sure that the property taxes are paid on time that escrow concept exists
for ten years of the project assuming that the developer has always paid
their property taxes on time if that is not the case or if somewhere after that
initial ten years they they pay the property taxes late this agreement
springs back into effect and we escrow their semi-annual property tax payments
so you always make sure that you have the property tax money additionally
there is a there is a maintenance agreement and a maintenance escrow
that's in place for that 59 acres that is west of the water park George mentioned
the option that the UG has with regard to project area 3 it's very important to
us that project area 3 ultimately happened that's the that's the four
hundred thousand square foot retail facility if they do not commence work on
that site by the 2009 date that's required 2019 date that is required
then the unified government has an option to take over that part of the
project to buy it or we have an option to buy it from the developer for fair
market value so as a practical matter it's the kind of extra it's an option
that you would probably only exercise if it had another developer had another
use for that project but it is an option that you have in the meantime the
developer agrees that they will come in and make regular reports to the unified
government about what's happening and their their potential activity for that
site so you will know exactly how they're doing and how that how their
leasing activity and sales activity is going for that site importantly if the
office project does come to that area that that 300 job project lands there
this option that you have goes away there's an agreement that if the office
project starts there and that's a significant catalyst in that project
that instead of commencing the retail part of the project at that point we
will agree that our option to buy that property goes away George did a nice job
of touching on the recognition of the prevailing wage obligations and we spoke
we spoke about that quickly I'll just I'll just tell you that a lot of the
development agreement provisions that existed in our 2006 development
agreement have completely carried through a lot of what we're discussing
are specific changes that are unique to this deal but when it comes to our kind
of normal provisions about insurance and indemnification and maintenance most of
those provisions have just carried through they're exactly what we agreed
to in 2006 the provision about the donations George is correct those
those donations have never been made but the agreement is that at star bond
closing seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is immediately made a payment
would be made to the unified government for a foundation or a nonprofit
organization that you will select after that we're going to sort of start over
and ramp up donations a hundred thousand dollars a year going forward
this obligation and this is a relatively new provision there was I think
ambiguity about how long this provision in the original agreement survived
arguably it said that this would go on forever as long as the water park was
was open and alive the developer argued to have that provision end with the life
of this agreement we have compromised and agreed that the donation provision
that donation obligation will survive for a ten-year period after the term of
this agreement so well actually commissioner it's unknown because the
development agreement term ends with the last project area so if let's say
project area three doesn't happen and the last project area that you ever
approve is the one that you would potentially approve tonight then it
would be 2034 plus ten it would be 2044 that it would survive however if five
years from now you approve another project for project area three or five
there's an additional 20 years plus ten so it'd be 30 years from the last
project plan that you approve long time and he'll still be arguing for the money
I guarantee it the last the last thing that I would touch on before I would
step away from the podium would be the MBE WBE LBE obligations that are in
this agreement I'm sorry the goals carry through through from the previous
agreement there are goals for professional services and for
construction despite what the summary may say there are not operational goals
as a matter of policy the UG doesn't do that anymore it was in the existing in
the former agreement it is not in the current agreement but it is the same
goals and these these obligations have teeth so among other things because you
have a pay-as-you-go CID component of the financing on this project if the
developer fails to make its reports for MBE LBE WBE compliance you have the right
to stop the money and not pay them until they make those reports in addition to
that if they fail to comply with their obligations and they're under that
agreement you have you have the right to reduce the CID that they would receive
by 25% so those are the practical remedies in the document that exist with
regard to LBE MBE and WBE so I know that's a lot of detail but we wanted to
make sure that folks knew exactly what was in this development agreement thank
you very much thank you what I'd like to do is if any commissioner has a
question at this point I would take it we are going to open up for a public
hearing and we're gonna combine the two public hearings and do them
simultaneously and so and after the public hearing if there are questions
from the Commission we can entertain them at that time does that sound right
okay so let's move forward
okay we have before we go to the public hearing we do have two more brief
presentations mayor very brief Kirk Peterson a good good evening here with
my partner and personal hero John Peterson Polsonelli 6201 College
Boulevard does he owe you money or something hey from the heart Richard
Napper you've heard his name a few times tonight many of you have seen him
working on this project for some time now many months he's here representing
EPR properties and Chuck Stites also a familiar face is representative of the
property owner that was all kidding aside that was the most comprehensive and
precise summary by staff and usually the attorney that I've seen it really did an
excellent job of hitting what has been months of discussions and I will not add
a single thing to that mayor which I know everyone is excited about I will
say probably 30 seconds of additional material though one is that again
Richard Napper behind me just want you to know he has really worked full-time
just coming on a year now full-time with EPR and the property owner just on this
project his goal was and his instructions were from those groups go
out and make this project happen again the the recession killed it and it
killed all the projects across the state and really the country go figure out
what you can do get an engine and make it happen bring us something great and
we would submit to you respectfully tonight that really it's Richard
Napper and what he's done again with his backers that have been able to put the
project before you tonight that you're gonna consider we're we were thrilled
about halfway through that process as Richard work when he stumbled upon mr.
Rob Heineman and they got their heads together and we all know what sporting
can do when they get creative and they came up with again the part of the
project you see in purple up on the screen and we again no other word for
thrilled at the synergy and excitement that mr. Heineman is gonna speak to you
briefly after me what this could mean what you talked about mayor with the
governor a month ago just thrilled that that's part of this overall project on
our property so with that with EPR strong financial backing and involvement
in this project with our zoning approval that happened earlier this evening with
our weekly meetings having gone on for months with our likely contractor
Clarkson and our architect and engineer we will be ready if we get this body's
blessing here tonight to move forward not to start by 1231 which has staff
correctly said is the time we have to start we will start here in the next few
weeks we are ready to turn dirt and make something great happen with this
project again so with that I know you really wanted to hear from was the MLS
champion CEO that we have in our midst so with that mr. Heineman may want to
speak to this his portion of the project thank you mr. Peterson mr. mayor
commission thank you so much for the time my name is Rob Heineman I'm the
CEO of on goal which does businesses sporting club which plays at sporting
park which is located at one sporting way hashtag go sporting so so with that
I guess the first thing that I'd like to say to all of you tonight is I want to
thank you for your patience this has been a project obviously that was
contemplated as part of our original development agreement around sporting
park and what we always wanted to do was do something in a world-class way
soccer fields are all over this country but what we thought we wanted to do was
see if we could you or lure us soccer here hopefully all of you were able to
see some of the World Cup this summer and see how US soccer captivated this
country and in particular this community and the fact that they are now going to
call the unified government home I think that's that's incredible gives me chills
to say that to you tonight what we're going to build as part of this project
is about 15 soccer fields an indoor field a full inside or full size indoor
field about a hundred thousand square feet of training and sports science and
we're also going to build a futsal project all throughout the community
which I mean honestly at the end of the day I think that could be the coolest
part because what what the community lacks my opinion right now are places to
play places for kids to play and we've got lots of these dilapidated tennis
courts and or open areas that we can go build these futsal courts or small sided
soccer fields and I think that's going to be something that's going to be
really compelling and I know we have the one that we put up at Wyandotte
High School that is used constantly so for us to have another 10 to 12 of those
throughout the community I think that's going to be a big deal so as important
as the US soccer facility and the big fields that we're talking about I
actually think the futsal fields and that grassroots nature is going to be
really strong for the community on the programming side this is going to create
tons and tons of room nights basically what US soccer is going to locate in
this facility is their coaching and referee education program which that
might sound kind of mundane and boring but as we strive to try to win the World
Cup what that really requires is that our coaching at all levels gets better
that we have a vertically integrated approach to how we develop players and
how we win and so for us to be able to put in place that program that's going
to build that foundation here in this country that's really what what the goal
needs to be in order for us to try to really be a serious competitor in the
World Cup we were with US soccer just this last week talking a bit the World
Cup I don't know if you remember several years ago we made an attempt here in the
US to get it in the US and Kansas City was also one of the bid markets and I
think the fact that probably with certainty with either in 2022 if Qatar
winds up flaking out and we take over the World Cup and or 2026 where we're
likely to be the prevailing bitter if that happens and we have the home of US
soccer here in Kansas City there's no doubt that will be a host city and just
a preview for you what that may look like back when we looked at this several
years ago the economic impact for each host city during the World Cup was a
little over a billion dollars for just the World Cup so I think this is just
such a great catalyst for what can be and I think it continues to build on all
the great successes that you've had of bringing world-class projects to this
area and so I want to thank you sincerely for the patience you've shown
in giving us the time to go make this happen and I give you my word when it
happens it'll be very special thank you thank you very much okay we are ready
now to open the public hearing and the public hearing as stated prior is to
amended and expanded Vacation Village Star District and redevelopment project
plans for project areas 1 2 & 4 so that is the public hearing is now open I
would ask if there's anyone who would like to speak in favor of the proposal
to please come forward at this time anyone like to speak in favor please
come forward at this time I live at 1236 Grandview Boulevard I'm not favor or not
favor but I want to ask a question can I do that you may okay on the WB and the
disadvantage and the women are they gonna be from Wyandotte County and
Kansas or are they gonna bring them in from other states like you started out
in the beginning the local minority and women businesses can we George can you
step forward and talk to the definition of those as contemplated in the unified
government's plans sure I'll try I'm not the subject matter expert on that and I
don't know if Doug might recall on the local end is it do they have to have
offices in County yeah I could answer the question the for the local that is
Wyandotte County requirement so to meet that criteria they are someone or a
within Wyandotte County or it can be a resident of Wyandotte County that owns
more than 50% of a business and that business then could be outside of the
county but they they must be a resident of our community the NB WB or the MBE
WBE portion is open to women or minority contractors with no geographic boundary
around where they live to be qualified they just have to be yes
minority and women yes local is what's defined as living within Wyandotte
County who keeps track of it we they the contractor submits their reports to our
compliance office and our compliance office then tracks that material we also
go out and we will make periodic checks to certify to make sure what they're
putting forth is accurate okay thank you thank you anyone else who'd like to
speak in favor I'm Kevin Quinn with legends Toyota and legends Honda one zero
parallel Parkway I believe this project will I continue what I think we've done
which is create a world-class automotive experience I don't know anything about
world-class soccer but I believe this is going to continue to make this a
destination Wyandotte County a destination to buy cars so I love the
effort that Richard has been putting into this and in such a short amount of
time and I'm excited that you guys are I believe supporting this project so
thanks sir can you answer a question for me because I get asked this all the time
why do car dealerships all like to be right next to each other well it's like
a shopping mall it draws it's advertising the locations so that
purchasers know where to go and they don't have to think about it they know
legends mall and so we like it because the rising tide lifts all boats thank
you I get that I get that question every single day so thank you hi I'm Charlene
Plotisha and I live at 1918 north 94th Street and I grew up across the street
from where I currently live and this is in my backyard and I'm very proud to
see a dot getting on the map both nationally and locally and I'm very
proud that we're starting to have things happen here and I grew up there and I
remember having to go to another area to buy a birthday card so I'm very happy
and grateful to what this Commission has been doing and those before it and I I'm
very happy even though it does affect me but I'm proud that we're doing
something and people are coming to see us thank you anyone else like to speak
in favor my name is Thomas Gordon I live at 2521 north 7th Street and I am
in favor of this project however I do have a couple of comments that I like to
make as well I think Commissioner Walker mentioned the fact that you know a lot
of projects come to Wyandotte County and they promise us with great tax
incentives and great things in the future but then when it comes down to
making those good on those commitments you know there are issues that come up
and they get argued and watered down ultimately the person that ends up with
the short end of the thing or the residents of Wyandotte County and I'd
like to see something put in place that will offer a guarantee most times when
you go into performances and you do things you have to put something up and
have some what they call some skin in the game so if you don't have anything
to lose you can always make great proposals you can make it sound real
good it can be fantastic ear candy it can look good on paper but if you got
your revenue at stake then we have some action so I'd like to see the
Commissioner to put something in place where that there's a something that they
have a risk that benefits our county and then these projects that come up for
proposals they're easier to accept so if we could put something in place as a
performance or that they need to leave some money with us after making these
proposals of the tax commitments that's what I'm speaking about if you project
that it's going to be a 42 million dollar project then it needs to be based
on 42 million dollars whether it performs or not so they need to leave
some money with us just like we would if I was coming to open a business if I
wanted to propose for a business I needed to have some equity so they need
to have some equity as well thank you very much thank you sir anyone else like
to speak in favor
my name is Marsha wrap 28 16 North 46th Street I just want to say this is a
wonderful thing for Wyandotte County another addition I hope that the people
that work there and train there spend a whole lot of revenue here I also want to
echo the words of a person who has a lot more knowledge than I did at budget time
remember when you bring in more buildings and more people you need more
police and fire so let's get those departments filled and keep them filled
thank you thank you
speaking in favor we're continuing with those speaking in favor of the project
speaking in favor I have said it every time nothing personal just saying it
every time trying to be consistent trying to be consistent I like the line
Mary Martin 804 South 89th Street you know I live in the area so I'm very
familiar with the area and I do like the proposal I think it would be good for
Wyandotte County however I think that we need to tweak what we doing and expand
a little bit I'm concerned that we are a little short-sighted in in our approach
I would like to see a little bit more inclusion in terms of what we're doing
not just so much soccer I am a former athlete I was a world-class Olympian
track and field volleyball basketball and never played soccer but do play tennis
now so I'm just thinking that for the the the girls that we have in our
community I think that we need to embrace them also and I just have this
world-class feel just for soccer that might be a little bit male driven and
some of our young ladies might not get a chance to participate I hear moans and
groans back here but you know the other thing is that also in my adult life I
have done construction I am a certified DB and MBE so I do know that process and
here in Wyandotte County I know that the MBEs and WBs are very limited in a
participation in construction and I would hate to see that continue so I
think that that needs to be opened up and broadened specifically for the
African-American community I know that here in Wyandotte we don't like to talk
about African-Americans participation specifically but I think we need to
address that issue because we're less than 1% that participate on any of that
construction that's been happening especially out in the legends I think
that that's wrong I think that shame on y'all I think that y'all need to look at
that the disparity study spoke to that and I think that we need to address that
if you just look at minorities in totality then you do meet your goal but
if you look at African-American specifically you don't so I think that
we need to address that what else did you talk about no I'm just playing anyway
I love you too mayor and thank you miss Marta look at those issues thank you
anyone else like to speak in favor I'm Greg Kendall I'm the president of
Wyandotte Economic Development Council and interim president of the Kansas
Kansas Chamber of Commerce at 727 Minnesota and live at 4318 North 112
Street here in KCK mayor commissioners colleagues I'm here to this evening on
behalf of the Wyandotte Economic Development Council specifically in
support of the proposed star bond district expansion as presented by the
UG team we know that the use of star bonds have had a tremendous economic
impact and benefit to Wyandotte County and has propelled this community into
being the top destination in the state of Kansas with an estimated 10 million
annual visitors 650 million in annual sales generated from the area and making
up 10% of the county's assessed valuation through more than a billion
dollars in combined public and private investments we now have more than 115
businesses in Village West including more than 25 restaurants and several
thousand jobs the synergy that's been created through the Kansas Speedway and
Village West created new destination tourism opportunities through
developments like Sporting Park the T Bones and Slitterbond and those
developments have been intertwined with the center continuous campus Hollywood
casino apartment developments and more recent recent discussions about a casino
hotel the US soccer facility announcement and a possible Convention
Center this proposed star bond district takes what's been successful and
continues to build on it in a strategic way going forward that allows us in the
development community maximum marketing opportunities this expanded area drives
development to the east side of 435 enhancing investments the unified
government has made along State Avenue and back towards both Providence Medical
Center and 78th and State collectively we've proven star bonds to be a
successful economic development tool to drive investment sales and property
taxes jobs and national awareness of our community in a broader context this
infuses new excitement into this quarter providing long-term economic growth to
the community creates additional tourism destination appeal and once again shows
Wyandotte County's aggressiveness towards economic development thank you
for your time and we again ask for your support for this request thank you
anyone else like to speak in favor
to the mayor the commissioners I personally think that you have a
wonderful program that you all proposed name and address please ma'am I'm sorry
my name is Christine Allen I live 3604 Delavan I'm here on behalf of talking
about blooming hills of the heartland which is a program that I have worked on
and I am working on we have quite a few homeless people in our area and so I
wonder where we have decided to understand the needs of our homeless
people and artificial intelligence is growing and when you say you're gonna
have a lot of jobs I wonder where we are going to look at the fact that as it
grows and right now when you pick up your phone or when you talk it's a voice
on the other end that's not human you know so I'm thinking are we really gonna
have the jobs that we said we're gonna have we really gonna be able to help our
people that we need to that we need to help so these are questions that I have
but I like your idea I like the proposals and I congratulate you thank
you ma'am all right anyone else like to speak at this time in favor
representative Tom burrows 31 31 south 73rd Terrace Kansas City Kansas mayor
commissioners ladies and gentlemen I'm here tonight to listen as to what this
proposal presents to our community and first and foremost I want to extend a
thank you to the Schlitterbahn folks who displayed professional courtesy and
including me in the information that has come forward this evening the district
that I represent is the proposed site of this future development I appreciate
that professional courtesy and I stand ready to support the project in my
political ventures I do know that you don't stand in the way of something that
is very fast-tracked and I stand ready to partner in any way that I can to help
the local unit of government continue its growth and success and its economic
viability in this community I would state that communication and inclusiveness
generates good government and I would hope that moving forward that we
continue to hold public hearings continue to engage the entire community
so that we can all collectively be grateful for the success that our
community has experienced through these developments with the national attention
of sporting park and the continued commitment under the most economic
trying of times by Schlitterbahn we have good partners we have long-term
viability I respect that I respect the work and commitment it takes of this
commission to ensure this project moves forward I want to thank Commissioner
Walker about the tax issue I know that Bota in Topeka is burdened with this
issue I hope that we can get it remedied and I hope we have a commitment to get
that done on behalf of the taxpayers of this community and I want to
specifically thank Commissioner Kane for ensuring that prevailing wage and our
union brothers and sisters and Kansas workers have the opportunity at these
quality jobs that is what economic development is about that is what a
community is about and I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be
included so I stand in support of the project and I say it's a great day to be
in Kansas City Kansas thank you mr. burrows we appreciate that anyone else
like to speak in favor
Kevin Gary 1900 north 94th Street it's more of a question it's a great thing
we're the last of the seven people to live on 94th Street and I wondered if
any discussions have been made regarding the residents there on the west side
that'd be area five I believe we're just gonna be just kind of left alone
still or are you guys gonna give us some money is that a rhetorical question I
can all right thank you any other anyone else who would like to speak in favor
let the record show I see no one else coming to the microphone is there anyone
who would like to speak in opposition tonight please come forward
hi I'm John Snyder attorney with Denton's law firm 4520 Main Street
Kansas City Missouri just so you know I'm a grew up in Rosedale with the
Sumner Academy and love to see all the positive development going on here in a
here in Wyandotte County I was reached out today by the owners of the legends
KKR legends and red legacy for some reason the the the notice of this
expanded a star bond district didn't reach the right people until today so I
got contact by Dan Lowe and West grammar at red legacy to find out a little more
information about this attend the hearing had a brief conversation with
Gilmore Bell trying to understand the the the boundary addition and try to
reach out to a couple others and not opposed to any of this generally right I
mean I think the the the little bond expansion and what's going on with US
soccer and everything is a wonderful wonderful thing and the owners are not
opposed at all to everything that's going on here other than the addition of
the star bond district to include their project because they haven't had any
dialogue no one's contacted them to discuss it in person so there's been no
dialogue so from their standpoint they you know they have some other projects
that they're considering out there multifamily a convention center project
some additional retail and this would directly impact some ability to do
certain things in the future on that project and so they're they just asked me
if I could come up here express their concerns and say that they you know
before this is adopted on property that that they own that they have an
opportunity to have some some dialogue about the about the impact on the on the
project and kind of go through it what that said they don't want to impede
progress of what's going on with projects one two three and five which I
don't think impact legends and certainly don't want to impact US soccer and not
sure if this project with all the all the proposed development that's done
within the Schlitterbund overall project area not sure why it needs to be
expanded onto their project when they haven't had any dialogue about that so
that's just their their concern and I apologize that that the principals are
out of town who would rather be here in person to kind of have some more dialogue
thank you all right anyone else who'd like to speak in opposition all right let
the record show that there's no one else coming forward at this time I will now
close the public hearing and with the item is now before the Commission for
consideration and we have two proposals one is an ordinance to approve the new
and project plans and the second is to adopt the resolution for the development
agreement for project areas one two three and five those are now properly
before us Commissioner Kane thank you mayor the I do think we need to tell
everyone in the area what's going on and as many people as possible I don't know
you're a little late I guess one of the things that I think is we've taken a
couple of different groups and brought them together and it brings something to
wind that county that nobody else could and the futsal I agree a hundred percent
about the fields for the schools in fact Harmon needs to get there first okay but
what people have to realize soccer is a growing sport and it's not just for boys
it's for girls as well and and I coached at Piper high school and I'm telling I
would have loved to have somebody show hey this is the drill you teach the kids
and said just yell on him till I got it done I can picture that practice
visualize anyway mayor the first one is an ordinance to approve the star district
and project plans all right move for approval the ordinance and whatever he
just said second it's been moved and seconded Townsend thank you at this time
I was trying to wait and hear all of the presentations I just had a few
questions factually since this is my first star bond deal and there were just
some specifics just the short version there are some numbers that mr.
Brankovic and mr. La Sala and points may so if you would allow just a few quick
point of questions absolutely I'd invite you to gentlemen come to the podium okay
I'm not sure whether it was during mr. La Sala's presentation or mr. Brankovic's
but there was a reference made to allocation of monies to the county to
the city Bonner Springs I'm not quite sure what that was pertaining to but my
question goes to what were you talking about and how much of that goes to I
don't know KCK why that County and this has resonance for me as I look forward
to going to the third budget and we're talking about the balance between KCK's
budget and why that counties so what was that in reference to yeah I think what
you're referring to is when we talked about the two dealerships that had
formally been present within the county that are that are coming into this
district there was a concern about preserving the base sales taxes for
those jurisdictions that those dealerships left and so there is an
agreement within this document where we will take fifteen point five million
dollars worth of sales a year and we're gonna Alec we're gonna keep those
dollars they will not wind up in this new district they will be allocated
pursuant to the Cali County formula and then the city portion of those sales
taxes will be evenly split between Bonner and Edwardsville where those
dealerships the areas where those dealerships were leaving all right so
they were based on where they're leaving okay thank you that took care of that
the 90 million dollar figure that was mentioned what is the triggering event
that gets that to the city is that the bond yeah it would be the issuance and
sale of bonds okay and the 25 million that was the hold back is that 25
million of that 90 correct okay with regard to teak now this this was done
during mr. Brakovich's presentation you talked about teeth that was that are in
the development agreement with regard to the MBE WBE issue couple of questions
one to qualify as an MBE or WBE with this project do those entities have to
currently have some certification by the state or do we in KCK one that
county issue our own certification or is none required they must have
certification so that's a requirement we do not do a certification and process
ourselves we accept certification process from the state of Kansas or the
certification process in Kansas City Missouri okay the second
thank you with regard to exercising the teeth in the equipment in the
development agreement is the option for us to I believe it was withdrawn money
or withhold money predicated on the developer not being in compliance with
the goal stated or simply not filing a report I wasn't clear on that it's both
you have two different remedies within the documents because you have pay as
you go CID and and money that incentive that will flow through that CID and come
to the developer on an ongoing basis throughout the project one remedy that
you have has to do with reporting if they don't file the reports you can shut
off the money and say I'm not going to give you any more of this CID money
until you comply and fit and file your reports the 25% reduction in the CID
distributions has to do with really failure to comply with the goals and so
under the agreement so it's it's about both missing the goals and proving that
they did not use best efforts to meet those goals under the agreement okay
well you took the words right out of my mouth with the best efforts issue okay an
issue that I just found intriguing by raised by Commissioner Walker with the
valuation of projects like this maybe we can't do it now but just my thought on
hearing that is is there some way in future deals like this that we could
establish just as a ghost a negotiated point a floor on which they agree to pay
taxes like a plus or minus five percent of whatever the stated appraised value
probably speak to this more but this has been an issue we have pushed to try to
find if there was a way that we could get a guarantee on a tax you know when
you do a property tax abatement and you enter into an IRB we have the ability to
state this is what's going to be paid in association with that we don't have any
property tax abatement in this deal so we have challenged ourselves throughout
these deals to try to come up with different ways you know to come in and
find where the guarantee is the number that mr. Bracovitch stated in relation
to the property tax values that we think will be in this project are related on a
couple of factors which we feel makes it fairly secure one is a large part of the
property values that are associated with this deal or the new deal coming forward
come from the auto dealers so in this case we have a couple of the new auto
dealers that mr. Quinn represented up there that we have as good comparables
in the area unlike some of the other projects were brought into our community
when they're somewhat of an anomaly when they're built so that's unique to the
area you don't have comparables in this case we do other numbers he reference
our Slitterbond's been in place as a water park and they've been paying taxes
out there for a number of years so they have a value so he that was included as
part of the number as we go forward and say this is where we're at so that gives
us a reasonable confidence when we're looking at this kind of a project to say
where we're at but Todd if you've come up with a thought tonight as to how we
could guarantee our taxes please throw it out there no I don't have anything
specific tonight I would welcome the opportunity to talk about this issue in
some detail with the Commission perhaps at some point an executive session
there are a bunch of legal issues about this issue and how much you can
contractually bind someone to a specific number with regard to property taxes
because you have to balance your desire to do that and your ability to contract
with that party against their inherent right to protest their property taxes so
all I can say I think is that there's a bunch of legal issues that have to do
with a property owner's inherent right to protest their taxes and that's really
the challenge about any provision that would lock a developer into a specific
number and I was thinking though if you agreed to it then you forgo that
challenge you don't okay well just a thought that was intriguing last thing I
was happy to see mr. Heineman here and it makes me recall that I have an IOU to
find out about the applicability suitability of a footsball court in
district one where we have an open field and we're trying to develop Garland Park
this would be a natural bridge from what's happening out West in my district
so I look forward to following up on that again thank you thank you very much
Commissioner Walker
ask George or Todd to respond to the gentleman's comment about late notice
did we send it to someone who should have gotten it and you know through no
fault of ours it didn't make it to or get opened by or read by the right
person I I'll the first part of my answer is what we're required to do by
by the statute and that is send certified notice to all property owners
and tenants within the notified within the affected district within a 10-day
period from when this body approved the resolution setting the public hearing
knowing what the economic development staff what a task that was given the
number of owners we did verify that one went to KKR and one went to legends
partners we also worked with our business license division to ensure that
any address physical address within the legends shopping center both received a
letter to whoever was stated as the owner of the property and a letter to
we didn't bring the receipts to that certified mail down with us but we'll
verify to ensure that we received a return mail from that well if I heard
the gentleman correctly he wants some kind of a dialogue and I would assume
that you're capable of dialoguing and presenting what needs to be done I'm not
in favor of delaying this but I am they are one of our community partners and I
would rather than be on board then litigating a you know certified mail
