Third  Quarter  Report 


July  19,  1995 


Dear  Stockholder: 

We're  pleased  to  report  record  results  for 
the  third  quarter  of  fiscal  year  1 995.  Total 
revenues  for  the  quarter  ended  March  31 , 
1 995  more  than  tripled  to  $  1 06,4 1 4,000, 
from  $3 1 ,689,000  in  fiscal  1 994's  third 
quarter.  The  Company's  subscriber  base  also 
tripled  to  2,31 3,000  members,  up  from 
71 3,000  at  March  31,1 994.  Since  that 
time  the  company  has  announced  that  it 
surpassed  the  3  million  member  mark, 
reflecting  continued  momentum  in  the  market 
for  interactive  services. 

Excluding  special  costs,  AOL  quadrupled 
net  earnings  to  $5. 1  million,  or  the  equivalent 
of  $0. 1 2  per  share,  in  the  third  quarter, 
despite  net  losses  of  approximately 
$1 .6  million  from  its  new 
subsidiaries  and  its  recently 
launched  2Market,  Inc.  interactive 
shopping  joint  venture.  In  the  same 
quarter  a  year  ago,  the  Company 
earned  $1 ,272,000,  or  $0.03  per  share. 
Earnings  per  share  calculations  reflect  two 
previous  two-for-one  stock  splits  over  the  past 
year. 

With  the  latest  quarter's  special  costs, 
which  represent  approximately  $7.6  million 
of  acquired  research  and  development  and 
about  $300,000  in  after  tax  amortization 
expense,  AOL  reported  a  loss  of 
$2,817,000,  or  $0.08  per  share.  These 
charges  include  the  remaining  writeoff  of 
acquired  in  process  research  and 
development  relating  to  the  approximately 
$50  million  acquisition  of  BookLink 
Technologies,  Inc.  and  NaviSoft,  Inc.  in  the 
second  quarter. 

The  March  quarter  was  filled  with 
corporate  and  brand  activities  aimed  at 


solidifying  a  leadership  position  for  AOL  in 
the  worldwide  market  for  interactive  services. 
In  January  we  announced  a  joint  venture  with 
Bertelsmann,  AG,  one  of  the  world's  largest 
media  companies,  to  offer  interactive 
services  in  Western  and  Eastern  Europe,  with 
the  first  services  expected  to  launch  later  this 
year  in  Germany,  France  and  the  United 
Kingdom.  In  addition,  several  new  alliances 
and  unique  content  areas  were  announced 
during  the  period.  The  company  unveiled  the 
first  selected  participants  of  the  Greenhouse 
Program,  a  program  specifically  designed 
for  entrepreneurs  to  create  unique  online 

content  and  new  interactive  services  for 
_  America  Online  and  the  Internet. 

New  Line  Television  and  AOL 
k      announced  that  they  joined 
■     forces  to  develop  "The  Hub," 
W      a  unique  online  source  for 
entertainment,  interaction, 
and  information 


targeted  towards  young  adults.  AOL  and 
American  Express  have  teamed  up  to 
provide  ExpressNet,  offering  a  broad  array 
of  cardmember  and  travel  services.  In 
addition  the  company  added  several  new 
content  areas  ranging  from  a  Tax  Forum  to 
the  new  "Sunday  Funnies  LIVE"  series 
featuring  appearances  by  cartoonists  and 
their  characters. 

The  coming  months  are  going  to  be 
exciting  and  eventful  for  AOL  and  our 
subscribers,  as  we  continue  working  to 
leverage  our  rapidly  growing  subscriber 
base  and  consumerize  the  Internet,  provide 
higher  speed  and  wider  access  to  our 
service,  and  develop  new  revenue  streams.
