INSPECTION PROGRAM

This pamphlet provides information 
concerning annual inspection requirements 
for trucks, tractors, trailers, semi-trailers, 
trailer converter dollies and combinations. 


COMMERCIAL VEHICLE INSPECTION PROGRAM 


Ontario has joined a North American wide 
program designed to make certain that 
commercial vehicles using the province’s 
roads are in top condition. This inspection 
program requires all commercial vehicles to 
be inspected by certified mechanics on an 
annual basis. 


For the purposes of this program: 


* acommercial vehicle means truck, tractor, 
trailer, semi-trailer, trailer converter dolly 
and combinations. 


* combined gross weight means the total 
weight of all vehicles and load in a com- 
bination. 


WHICH VEHICLES ARE INCLUDED? 


The Commercial Vehicle Inspection Program 
is being implemented in stages in Ontario. 
Commercial vehicles with a gross weight, 
registered gross weight, combined gross 
weight or manufacturer's gross vehicle weight 
rating more than: 


22,000 kgs must be inspected by Jan. 1992 
10,000 kgs must be inspected by Jan. 1993 
4,500 kgs must be inspected by Jan. 1994 


Unladen commercial vehicles are exempt from 
inspection requirements when being operated 
under an In Transit permit or a Dealer and 
Service number plate. 


HOW DO YOU KNOW IF A VEHICLE HAS 
BEEN INSPECTED? 


A truck or tractor inspected in Ontario will 
have an annual inspection sticker (yellow) 
placed in the lower left corner of the windshield 
or on the left side of the truck cab. A trailer or 
trailer converter dolly will have an inspection 
sticker on the left side as close to the front as 
practicable. An annual inspection certificate 
is also issued with the sticker which satisfies 
the requirements of other jurisdictions. 


If a vehicle is inspected in another province, 
the sticker will be placed to comply with their 
regulations. Some jurisdictions may require 
that only a certificate of inspection be carried 
in the cab. 


Inspections performed in the U.S., may not 
include the issuance of a sticker. Therefore, 
inspection documents proving completion of 
the inspection must be carried and produced. 


IS THERE A SET TIME FOR AN 
INSPECTION? 


No. An inspection must be done once a year 
and the sticker must be current. But it’s up to 
you to decide when to have an inspection. 
You may want to have your vehicle inspected 
during regular maintenance to save time and 
possibly money as well. 


WHAT IS THE COST OF THE 
INSPECTION? 


There is no regulated fee for the inspection. 
The fee is determined and collected by the 
inspection station. 


WHAT IS TO BE INSPECTED? 


All safety related components are inspected. 
(A complete listing of components and 
performance standards is contained in the 
Highway Traffic Act, Regulation 483, R.S.O. 
1980.) 


DOES THIS INSPECTION REPLACE THE 
COMMERCIAL VEHICLE SAFETY 
ALLIANCE (CVSA) INSPECTION? 


No. The annual inspection complements the 
CVSA inspection. The CVSA standard is an 
international set of criteria used _ strictly 
for on-the-road inspections involving 
randomly selected vehicles. CVSA 
inspections conducted by trained enforcement 
officers will continue throughout North 
America. 


DOES THIS REQUIREMENT COVER 
ONTARIO-PLATED VEHICLES ONLY? 


No. Any commercial vehicle operating in 
Ontario that meets the weight classifications 
of the program must comply.
