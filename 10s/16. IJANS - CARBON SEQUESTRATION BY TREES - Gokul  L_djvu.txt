ABSTRACT 

Trees  from  the  urban  regions  currently  store  carbon,  which  can  be  released  into  the  atmosphere  after  the  death  of 
the  tree,  and  capture  carbon  as  they  grow.  A  major  challenge  is  the  lack  of  correct  and  spatially  explicit  estimates  of  tree 
carbon  storage,  over  the  entire  urbanized  area.  The  study  was  carried  out  on  the  agronomy  Experimental  Farm, 
Annamalai  University,  to  know  the  Carbon  sequestration  from  the  identified  fourteen  tree  species.  Assessment  of  the 
carbon  sequestration  of  urban  trees  was  carried  out  through  the  biomass  estimation  and  quantification,  for  the  estimation  of 
total  C02  sequestration  DBH  and  height  measured.  Wood  densities  were  obtained  from  the  world  agro  forestry  centre. 
It  is  found  that,  highest  carbon  sequestration  is  rain  tree  ( Albiziasaman )  is  427.00  kg,  followed  by  coconut 
(Cocos  nucifera),  which  is  420.54  kg.  It  is  found  that,  total  Carbon  sequestered  by  the  selected  area  is  2081.00  kg. 
Carbon  sequestration  is  a  way  to  mitigate  the  accumulation  of  greenhouse  gases  released  in  the  atmosphere,  by  the  burning 
of  fossil  fuels  and  other  anthropogenic  activities.

INTRODUCTION 

Developmental  activities  and  increased  transportation  activities  are  increasing  the  concentration  of  air  pollutants 
as  greenhouse  gases,  especially  C02  (Chavan  and  Rasal,  2010).  These  are  leading  to  increased  atmospheric  temperature, 
through  the  trapping  of  certain  wavelengths  of  heat  radiation  in  the  atmosphere.  The  increasing  carbon  emission  is  of  major 
concerns,  and  addressed  in  the  Kyoto  Protocol  (Ravindranath  et  al.,  1997).  Natural  forests,  forest  plantations, 
Agro  forestry  practices  and  some  other  agricultural  activities,  act  as  a  sink  for  carbon  dioxide  (C02),  through 
photosynthesis  and  store  carbon  as  biomass  (Benites  et  al.,  1999;  David  and  Crane,  2002;  Thangata  and  Hildebran,  2012). 
They  reduce  the  amount  of  C02  in  the  atmosphere,  and  provide  benefit  to  the  global  climate  (Kort  and  Turnock,  1999). 

Forests  are  a  critical  component  of  the  global  carbon  cycle,  storing  over  80%  of  global  terrestrial  aboveground 
carbon  (Dixon  et  al.,  1994).  Forests  play  a  significant  role  in  the  global  carbon  cycle,  through  dynamic  exchange  of  C02  in 
the  atmosphere.  The  management  of  such  terrestrial  forest  carbon  stocks  can  deliver  a  significant  component,  to  the 
international  climate  change  abatement  strategies  (Read  et  al.  2009).  Forest  ecosystems  play  a  leading  role  in  global 
terrestrial  carbon  cycle,  owing  to  their  huge  carbon  pool  and  high  productivity  (Schlesinger  et  al.,  1997).  Several  studies  so 
far  suggested  that,  forest  action  can  cost  effectively  and  provide  roughly  30%  of  the  total  global  effort  needed  in  all  sectors, 
to  meet  climate  mitigation  strategies  (Webb,  1992).  With  an  increasing  concern  for  global  climate  changes,  resulting  from 
more  and  more  anthropogenic  greenhouse  gas,  protecting  carbon  stocks  in  the  existing  forests  and  getting  the  new  carbon 
stocks  through  afforestation  and  reforestation,  have  become  the  important  measures  to  enhance  the  carbon  sequestration 
capacity  in  the  terrestrial  ecosystems  and  mitigate  the  increasing  carbon  dioxide  concentration  in  the  atmosphere 
(Lai,  2005).  The  global  forest  plantation  was  187  million  ha  in  2005,  about  1.4%  of  the  total  world  available  land  area.

On  this  planted  area  36%  were  located  in  the  tropics  and  64%  in  the  non-tropical  regions.  The  tropical  forest  plantation 
area  was  more  than  double  from  1995  to  2005,  and  on  an  average,  the  growth  rate  of  tropical  forest  plantations  was  8.6% 
per  year  (FAO,  2006;  Arias  et  al.,  2011).  Plantation  forests  are  important  sources  of  timber,  that  alleviate  the  pressure  on 
native  forests,  for  commercial  forest  products  and  are  viewed  as  an  effective  means  of  short-term  carbon  sequestration 
(Turner  et  al.,  1999;  Silver  et  al.,  2000;  Curlevski  et  al.,  2010).  Growing  trees  in  urban  areas  can  be  a  potential  contributor, 
in  reducing  the  concentration  of  C02  in  the  atmosphere  by  its  accumulation  therefore,  in  the  form  of  biomass 
(Chavan  and  Rasal,  2010). 

Biomass  is  an  essential  aspect  of  studies  of  the  carbon  cycle  (Cairns  et  al.,  2003;  Ketterings  et  al.,  2001). 
There  are  two  methods  to  calculate  forest  biomass,  one  is  direct  method  and  the  other  is  an  indirect  method 
(Salazar  et  al.,  2010).  Direct  methods,  also  known  as  destructive  methods,  involves  of  felling  trees  to  determine  biomass 
(Parresol,  1999;  Salazar  et  al.,  2010).  Indirect  means  of  estimation  of  stand  biomass  are  based  on  allometric  equations, 
using  measurable  parameters.  The  use  of  circumference  or  girth  at  breast  height  alone  (expressing  the  basal  area) 
for  above  ground  biomass  estimation,  is  common  to  many  studies  that  showed  that  diameter  at  breast  height  (DBH)  is  one 
of  the  universally  used  predictors,  because  it  shows  a  high  correlation  with  all  tree  biomass  components  and  easy  to  obtain 
accurately  (Razakamanarivo  et  al.,  2012;  Antonio  et  al.,  2007;  Heinz  et  al.,  2002;  Zianis,  2008). 

Most  of  the  research  works  revealed  that,  AGB  is  strongly  correlated  with  tree  diameter 
(Brown,  1997;  Brown  and  Lugo,  1984;  Clark  et  al.,  2001).  Also,  it  is  accepted  that,  simple  model  with  only  diameter  as 
input  is  a  good  estimator  of  the  above  ground  biomass  (Brown,  1997;  Nelson  et  al.,  1999;  Clark  et  al.,  2001;  Djomoa  et  al., 
2010). 

Hence,  in  the  present  study,  we  took  the  trees  on  agronomy  farm  in  Annamalai  Nagar  and  measure  the  width  of 
the  different  tree  species,  by  taking  the  average  (at  breast  height).  Thereby,  we  are  able  to  find  the  carbon  sequestered  by 
trees  in  our  farm  area. 

Based  on  the  above  evidence,  the  study  was  planned  with  the  following  objectives. 

•  To  identify  various  tree  species  available  at  the  Experimental  Farm. 

•  To  measure  the  diameter  at  the  breast  height  and  identify  the  type  of  wood. 

•  To  analyze  the  co2  sequestered  from  the  existing  tree  species. 

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS 

The  study  on  carbon  sequestration  was  conducted  in  our  experimental  farm  during  18.12.2016  to  15.4.2017. 
Field  experiments  were  conducted  at  the  experimental  farm,  Department  of  Agronomy,  Annamalai  University, 
Annamalai  Nagar.  The  experimental  sites  are  geographically  situated  at  11°24'  North  latitude  and  79°44’  East  longitudes 
and  at  an  altitude  of  +5.79  m,  above  mean  sea  level.  The  weather  data  of  the  experimental  site  were  moderately  warm  with 
hot  summer  months.  While  the  maximum  temperature  varied  between  27.9°C  to  39.2°C  and  minimum  temperature  ranging 
from  20.2°C  to  28.5°C.  The  high  relative  humidity  of  95%  (during  October)  and  low  of  76%  (during  May),  with  a  mean  of 
71%  were  recorded.  Total  rainfall  of  Annamalai  Nagar  is  1086.3  mm  with  a  distribution  of  784.1  mm  during  the  northeast 
monsoon,  271.3  mm  during  southwest  monsoon,  9.2  mm  during  winter  period,  and  21.7  mm  during  the  hot  summer  period, 
spreading  over  43  rainy  days.  The  mean  hour  of  bright  sunshine  per  day  is  6.7.

Survival  Factor 

Survival  factor  can  be  calculated  by  the  number  of  trees  surviving  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  year. 
It  is  necessary  to  account  mortality,  for  a  fraction  of  trees  planted  inevitably  die  in  each  year. 
The  ideal  method  for  determining  the  number  of  trees  surviving  is  to  conduct  a  census  of  the  tree  planted. 

Annual  Sequestration  Rate 

The  annual  carbon  sequestration  rate  is  the  amount  of  carbon  table  given  for  trees  in  urban  and  suburban. 

Carbon  Sequestered  Per  Year  in  Agronomy  Experimental  Farm 

It  can  be  calculated  by  multiplying  the  number  of  trees  surviving  and  annual  sequestration  rate.

•  The  highest  amount  of  carbon  sequestration  is  Rain  tree  ( Albiziasaman )  =  427.00  kg.  It  is  high  because  of  its 
biomass,  hardwood  and  age. 


•  The  lowest  amount  of  carbon  sequestration  is  teak  ( Tectonagrandis )  =  0.2.50  kg. 

CONCLUSIONS 


Carbon  sequestration  is  broad  and  an  important  subject.  It  is  essential  in  the  effort,  to  circumvent  the  effects  of 
climate  change.  Carbon  capture  and  storage  is  one  of  the  most  effective  and  discussed  methods  of  solving  this  issue. 
However,  there  is  no  single  solution  to  this  problem.  We  cannot  pump  carbon  underground  forever.  In  order  to  reverse  the 
effects  of  climate  change,  carbon  capture  and  storage  must  be  coupled  with  forward  thinking  methods  of  generating  clean 
energy,  so  that  there  is  no  more  carbon  being  released  into  the  atmosphere.  Furthermore,  cleaner  methods  of  farming, 
reforestation  and  afforestation  are  effective  methods  of  restoring  natural  methods  of  sequestration  that  existed  before 
humans  tampered  with  the  environment.
