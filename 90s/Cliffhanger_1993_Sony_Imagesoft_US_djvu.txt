CLIFFHANGER 



THE WORD FOR ADVENTORE 

It's what we say when we're talking about a close call... the 
definition of suspense... the word for adventure... 

it's amma. 



Based on the bare-knuckle, big-action blockbuster adventure 
hit starring Sylvester Stallone, CLIFFHANGER brings to your 
Sega CD System the treacherous cliffs and icy rock faces...the 
dizzying heights and deadly avalanches...the crazed villains and 
nonstop combat action of the film. You are Gabe Walker, 
Rocky Mountain rescue ace, now facing the most grueling 
operation of your life: saving your friends and defeating the 
megalomaniac Qualen and his gang of high-altitude bad guys. 





HANDLING 
YOUR SEGA 
CD DISC

exclusively with the Sega CD™ System. 

Do not bend it, crush it, or submerge it 
in liquids. 

Do not leave it in direct sunlight or near a 
radiator or other source of heat. 

Be sure to take an occasional recess during 
extended play, to rest yourself and the Sega 
CD Disc. 



KEEP YOUR SEGA CD DISC CLEAN. Always hold by the edges, 
and keep in its case when not in use. Clean with a lint-free, soft 
dry cloth - wiping in straight lines from center to edge. Never

GAME 
CONTROL 



TO PAUSE GAME: 

Press the START Button. Press it again to 
resume play. 

TO CONTINUE AFTER LOSING ALL 
YOUR LIVES: 

Press the START Button to resume play 
when you're at the Continue screen. 

TO WALK: 

Use the D Pad to walk in any direction - up, 
down, left, right, and diagonally. 



TO RUN: 

Press D Pad LEFT or RIGHT twice in quick succession to run 
in that direction. After you've started running, you can run up 
and down on the screen by pressing diagonally on the D Pad 
in the direction you want to run. 

TO CLIMB OR DESCEND: 

Look for surfaces with little footholds. To start climbing such a 
surface, approach the wall and press UP. To start descending, 
walk to the edge and press DOWN. Then, whether you're 
climbing or descending, use the arrow buttons on the D Pad to 
move in the direction you want. If you're shot while climbing 
or descending, you'll have a brief moment to recover - press 
UP while hanging. Press and hold the A Button to climb or 
descend more rapidly. But beware - when you're moving fast 
on a wall, you won't have a chance to recover if you're hit, and 
you'll fall to your doom. 



SUMMARY |j 



TO ROPE-CLIMB OVER CHASMS: 

Walk up to the rope and press the C Button. While grasping the 
rope, press LEFT or RIGHT to climb hand over hand in that 
direction. You cannot recover from a hit you take while 
rope-climbing. 

COMBAT MOVES: 

Use the Controller Buttons as follows to fight: 

• To Jab, Execute Bulldozer Move and Pick Up Objects: 

Press the A Button. In rapid succession: a combination of four 
punches - jab, left hook, right hook, uppercut. Press D Pad 
LEFT or RIGHT (whichever is opposite to the way you're facing 
at the moment) during the four-punch move to back- 
hand enemies attacking from behind. While running: 
bulldozer move. When near an object: pick up the object. 

• Jump: Press the C Button. Press C while running to 
execute a flying leap. 






Kick: Press the B Button. In rapid succession: alternating high 
and low kicks. Press and hold: spinning back kick. 

Flying Kick: Press the B Button at the top of your jump. Press 
C.thenB while running to execute a running flying kick. 

Super Kick: Press the A and B Buttons simultaneously. This 
move clears out your enemies very effectively, but it takes 
extra energy from your power bar, so it's for desperate situa- 
tions only. 






Block or Duck: Press B and C Buttons simultaneously 
and any D Pad direction except down to block blows to 
your head. Press B and C Buttons and D Pad DOWN to 
duck. Beware: some enemy moves, such as the low 
kick, can only be partially blocked; others, like the knife 
swipe, can't be blocked at all.

WEAPONS 

You're a pretty rugged guy, but you're still going to need some 
weapons to survive. So be sure to take advantage of what 
comes your way, including knives and guns. 



Weapons are used as follows: 



^ 



Z7 







Knife: To slash with the knife, press 
the A Button. To throw it, press the 
A and B buttons simultaneously. 
Once you throw a knife, it's gone. 

UZI: Press the A Button to fire. To 
point left or right, use the D pad. A 
gun has 12 rounds of ammo: after 
you fire 12 times, you lose the gun. 
You can acquire the Uzi by knocking 
it out of your enemy's hands. 



Campfires: Look for campfires like this one 
along the way - you need to warm yourself by 
the fire to replenish your energy. 







On levels one and four, your only way of escape 
from an approaching avalanche is down the 
side of a slippery, snow-covered mountain, and 
the only way down is on your snow board. 
You better travel down the mountain quickly 
and accurately because if you don't, you'll be 
buried by the avalanche! 

AVALANCHE METER 

Watch this meter and be sure to stay 

well ahead of the avalanche or you'll be sorry. 



OPERATING YOUR SNOW BOARD 

To Speed Up: Hold down the B Button. 



To Slow Down: Press the 
D Pad down. 

To Steer Right: Press the 
D Pad right. 

To Steer Left: Press the D 
Pad left. 

Jump: Press the A Button.

THE ESCAPE FROM QUALEN 

You and your friend Hal fall into the clutches of 
Qualen, the psycho leader of a band of 
crazed fugitives. They're looking for 
three metal cases that were lost in a plane 
wreck— together the cases hold S100 million in 
cold cash — and Qualen positively insists 
that you help in the search. Luckily, you 
manage to escape, and set out in search of the 
money in an effort to ransom Hal and save 
his life. To find the first money case, you must cross a forbidding 
mountain landscape and fight off a variety of enemies. Finally, 
you'll have to outrun a huge avalanche at breakneck speed on 
your snowboard to survive this level and go on. 

IN SEARCH OF THE SECOND CASE 

Having recovered the first of the three money cases, you go in 
search of the second one. In this level, you must fight your 
way through treacherous forested terrain, while fighting 
evermore threatening enemies. And at the end: Heldon, one 
big, tough, body-slamming wrestler who doesn't make friends 
very easily. 

ON TO DOUGLAS CABIN - AND JESSIE 

Now almost freezing to death, you seek the shelter of Douglas 
Cabin, the mountain hideaway where your friend Jessie 
anxiously awaits your arrival. All you have to do is find the 
cabin — and pull off some tricky climbing maneuvers 
while fighting enemies along the way. Not to mention 






Kynette, the kung fu king who stands between you and that 
high-altitude hearthfire. 

GET THE THIRD MONEY CASE AND SNOWBOARD 
YOUR WAY TO SAFETY 

Get to the third case of money before Qualen! Use your rope 
climbing skills and powerful punch to defeat Qualen's henchmen 
who cross your path. After finding the last money case, snow- 
board your way to safety. Watch out for those falling trees! 

THE CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE BITKER LADDER 

Whew, that was a close one! Now it's back up the mountain to 
safety, you hope! Watch your step - one wrong move and you're 
buzzard feed. ..or swiss cheese if Qualen's trigger-happy 
henchmen get you first. Only 200 yards to the ladder - if you 
can get past Travers. He's expecting your arrival, and he's look- 
ing forward to filling you full of lead! 

ALL THAT MONEY LOST! 

Your friends are safe, but you've destroyed the loot and Qualen 
is out-of-his-mind mad about it! For you, it's back down the 
mountain in a big hurry, with Qualen in hot pursuit at the con- 
trols of the hijacked rescue chopper. Look out for Qualen's 
minions as they come at you with a vengeance! 

FACE TO FACE WITH QUALEN 

Now it's payback time. Just you and Qualen, on the mangled 
helicopter, one slip away from plunging into the canyon below. 
This is it. Somebody's going to take a fall, a long one. Make sure 
it's Qualen.
