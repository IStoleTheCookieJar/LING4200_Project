GOVERNOR'S 
PERSPECTIVE 


It's  time  for  Montana  to  take  an  economic  inventory. 

On  the  plus  side  . . . 

^      Vast  natural  resources  and  a  rural  heritage  that  ties  our  hands  to  the  land  and  our  hearts  to  the 
landscape 

^      A  strong  educational  system  that  prepares  Montanans  to  compete  in  a  global  economy  and 
lead  self-reliant  and  self-fulfilling  lives 

^      Safe  and  civil  communities  where  workers  want  to  live  and  raise  their  families 

T      ^  work  ethic  that  delivers  a  full  measure  every  day 

^l"      Expanding  research  infrastructure  that  helps  solve  Montana  problems  and  creates  new  commercial 
opportunities 

^      Geographical  position  that  lets  Montana  be  a  major  gateway  to  the  global  economy 


On  the  negative  side  .  .  . 

■  Low  average  wages  of  our  work  force — 50th  in  the  nation' 

■  Steady  decline  in  our  per  capita  income,  now  46th  in  the  nation  (chart  1 ) 

■  An  abundance  of  multiple  job  holders — the  highest  in  the  nation  (chart  2) 

■  Job  growth  in  the  lower-paying  service  and  retail  trade  sectors  of  the  economy  and  a  decline 
in  traditionally  high-paying  jobs  (chart  3) 

■  Declining  per  capita  personal  income  now  at  78  percent  of  the  national  average  and  lower  than  our 
neighbors  (chart  4) 

■  Growing  population  disparity  between  eastern  and  western  Montana  (chiut  5) 

■  Exodus  of  many  young,  college-educated  Montanans,  the  ones  most  likely  to  build  Montana's 
economic  future

GOVERNOR'S  PERSPECTIVE 


Jobs  and  Income  protects  what  Montana  has  and  gives  us  the  tools  to  fix  the  economic  dilemma  we  face. 

Jobs  and  Income  starts  the  ball  rolling  toward  a  long-tenn  healthy  and  diverse  economic  climate  and  a  steady 
increase  in  high-paying  jobs. 

Jobs  and  Income  sets  up  specific,  measurable  goals  for  us  to  reach  by  the  year  2005. 

Jobs  and  Income  proposes  ways  to  help  communities  remain  vital  and  in  control  of  their  own  destinies.  Too 
many  local  communities — the  center  of  our  social  and  economic  lives — are  in  serious  jeopardy. 

Jobs  and  Income  will  allow  Montanans  to  keep  more  of  the  money  they  make  to  take  care  of  them- 
selves and  their  families. 


GOVERNOR'S 
PERSPECTIVE 


Jobs  and  Income  will  help  build  good-paying,  sustainable  jobs  in  industries  that  are  environmentally  compat- 
ible with  local  values  and  community  expectations. 

Jobs  and  Income  provides  for  business  expansion  across  all  sectors  of  the  economy  and  in  all  parts  of 
the  state,  east  and  west,  north  and  south. 

Jobs  and  Income  will  help  Montana  businesses  compete  nationally  and  globally  by  arming  them  with  knowl- 
edge about  how  to  promote  their  products  and  services  and  access  new  markets. 

Jobs  and  Income  is  a  blueprint  for  building  high-value  agri-businesses  and  expanding  our  manufactur- 
ing base. 

Jobs  and  Income  will  improve  state  and  local  community  infrastructure  so  we  are  not  locked  out  of 
electronic  commerce  and  so  our  citizens  can  continue  to  turn  on  the  tap  and  enjoy  a  glass  of  clean,  fresh 
water. 

Jobs  and  Income  is  not  "one  size  fits  all."  It's  about  State  and  local  partnerships  between  everyone 
who  has  a  stake  in  our  future — each  citizen,  community,  business,  fanner,  rancher,  manufacturer,  lender, 
educator,  and  government. 

Being  the  Last  Best  Place  isn't  about  being  last.  It  is  about  our  quality  of  life,  our  commitment  to  children,  the 
environment,  and  privacy.  It's  about  the  value  we  place  on  families  and  communities  and  the  concern  we  have 
about  securing  economic  well-being  for  all  Montanans. 

The  quality  of  our  future  depends  upon  the  choices  we  make  today.  It  will  take  courage  to  make  tough 
decisions,  perhaps  even  to  make  some  mistakes,  and  the  resolve  to  accept  that  "It's  Not  Business  As 
Usual."  Montana  has  made  many  investments,  but  now  we  need  to  make  our  most  important  invest- 
ment— in  ourselves.  For  it  is  Montanans  that  make  Montana  The  Last  Best  Place.

ACTION  NEEDED 

Create  a  permanent  business  recruitment  office  to  coordinate  business 
expansion  opportunities  for  the  State.  Conduct  a  national  site  location 
survey,  select  target  industries  that  meet  Montana's  new  business  location 
criteria,  and  conduct  a  proactive  business  attraction  campaign  including 
trade  advertising  and  tai"geted  business  recruitment  missions.

Focus  Group 


BENEFITS 

Improving  the  perception  of  Montana's  business  climate  by  identifying  and  niiirketing  the  state  as  an  attrac- 
tive location  to  expanding  businesses  will  result  in  new  employment  opportunities  for  Montanans  by  paying 
good  wages.  It  will  also  diversify  the  Montana  economy,  making  us  less  reliant  on  a  few  industries  which 
will  minimize  our  risk  during  times  of  economic  uncertainty.  This  strategy  is  a  key  ingredient  in  the  goal  to 
double  the  economic  value  of  agriculture  and  double  Montana  manufacturing  jobs  by  2005  as  well  as 
increase  our  average  annual  income.

FUNDING  SOURCES 

Not  Applicable 

ACTION  NEEDED 

Reduce  the  cuirent  minimum  loan  limit  for  Montana  Board  of  Investment  Infrastructure  Loans  from 
$500,000  to  $250,000  and  job  creation  threshold  from  50  to  25  new  jobs.  Provide  interest  rate  incentives 
for  higher  wage  employment.  This  financing  program  allows  local  governments  to  bonow  funds  from  the 
Board  of  Investments  to  meet  infrastructure  needs  such  as  water,  sewer,  and  roads  for  a  business  entity, 
which  in  turn  repays  the  local  government.  The  local  government  then  repays  the  Board  of  Investments. 

BENEFITS 

Currently,  only  4%  of  Montana  businesses  qualify  for  this  program  because  of  the  minimum  job  creation 
threshold  of  50.  Reducing  the  number  of  jobs  to  25  will  more  than  double  the  number  of  eligible  companies 
that  can  access  this  business  development  incentive.  In  addition,  it  will  open  participation  to  a  number  of 
communities  in  the  state  that  are  unlikely  to  locate  a  business  creating  at  least  50  jobs.  This  form  of  financ- 
ing incentive  will  allow  local  governments  and  Montana  to  compete  for  business  relocation  and  expansion 
projects  that  otherwise  would  not  be  possible  while  building  and  maintaining  community  infrastructure  needs.

ACTION  NEEDED 

Market,  package,  and  present  business  financing  packages  to  the  Montana  Board  of  Investments  to  increase 
the  number  and  percentage  of  investments  in  Montana  that  diversify,  strengthen  and  stabilize  the  Montana 
economy. 

BENEFITS 

State  statute  currently  provides  for  the  investment  of  up  to  25%  of  the  Coal  Tax  Trust  Fund  in  Montana.  Based 
upon  the  current  value  of  the  tnist.  approximately  $  1 50  million  can,  by  law,  be  invested  in  Montana  compiinies. 
The  latest  annual  report  for  the  Board  of  Investments  shows  that  only  16.3%  of  the  Coal  Tax  Trust  was 
invested  in  Montana  business.  Furthermore,  analysis  of  the  portfolio  overtime  shows  that  only  5  - 10%  of  the 
commercial  loans  were  to  manufacturing  businesses — those  businesses  that  add  value  to  Montana  resources 
that  are  sold  outside  the  state.  Marketing  the  programs  offered  to  Montana  businesses  through  the  Board  of 
Investments  will  result  in  investments  in  our  own  businesses,  in  a  stronger  manufacturing  sector  for  our  economy, 
and  better  paying  jobs  to  our  citizens.

ACTION  NEEDED 

To  assist  and  encourage  irrigation  development  in  Montana,  an  increase  of  $10  million  in  general  obligation 
bond  authority  to  the  private  loan  program  is  proposed.  This  would  double  the  capacity  of  the  existing 
program  to  help  expand  irrigated  lands. 

BENEFITS 

The  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Conservation's  private  water  development  loan  program  has 
been  in  existence  for  more  than  1 5  years.  This  successful  program  has  provided  much  needed  capital  for 
the  purchase  of  sprinkler  irrigation  systems  across  the  state.  As  established  by  the  Governor's  Vision  2005 
Task  Force  on  Agriculture,  our  goal  is  to  increase  Montana's  irrigated  lands  by  500.000  acres.  Establish- 
ment of  irrigation  is  sometimes  cost-prohibitive  in  the  short-temi.  In  order  to  expand  Montana's  production 
base,  it  is  important  that  the  State  provide  the  potential  for  low-interest  loans  to  producers  who  are  seeking 
to  develop  irrigation.  Increasing  irrigated  acres  is  directly  related  to  agriculture's  ability  to  grow  high-value 
crops.  Only  through  the  application  of  irrigated  water  can  the  croplands  produce  the  quantity  and  quality  of 
product  that  the  market  demands.  This  program  will  assist  Montana's  producers  in  increasing  the  amount  of 
land  under  irrigation  and  improve  the  water-use  efficiency  of  the  lands  already  irrigated.

ACTION  NEEDED 

The  Renewable  Resource  Grant  program  funds  a  variety  of  natural  resource  projects  including  irrigation 
system  development  and  rehabilitation,  water  system  improvements,  stream  restoration  programs,  and 
planning  studies.  This  program  has  seen  increasing  demand  over  the  past  decade,  and  it  is  expected  to  see 
even  greater  demand  as  the  overall  strategy  to  increase  the  value  of  Montana  agriculture  begins  to  take 
effect.  In  order  to  meet  the  increased  need  for  financial  assistance,  this  proposal  will  increase  by  $  1 .5 
million  the  amount  of  grant  funds  available  for  irrigation  projects  and  will  provide  an  additional  $500,000  for 
planning  grants. 

BENEFITS 

The  increase  in  grant  funding  will  provide  the  additional  fmancial  resources  needed  to  implement  the  goal  of 
doubling  the  value  of  Montana  agriculture  by  the  year  2005.  Local  governments  will  directly  benefit  from 
this  additional  grant  funding.  Included  under  this  proposal  will  be  existing  and  new  irrigation  districts  that 
seek  to  expand  inigated  acres  or  repair  existing  facilities.  Also,  communities  seeking  infrastrticture  financial 
assistance  will  benefit  from  both  the  additional  grant  dollars  and  planning  assistance.  Ultimately,  it  is  the 
residents  served  by  the  local  governments  that  will  benefit  from  lower  rates  and  the  natural  resource  benefits 
of  the  projects  developed.

ACTION  NEEDED 

For  Montana  to  remain 
competitive  with  proposals 
from  14  other  states  for  the  siting  of  a  spaceport  to  launch  and  retrieve  the  VentureStar  reusable  launch 
vehicle,  Montana  must  provide  a  reasonable  incentive  package.  Primai-y  incentives  include  an  exemption 
from  business  equipment  taxes  on  items  used  for  operations  of  the  spaceport.  Additionally,  it  is  necessary 
to  provide  basic  infrastructure  to  the  Montana  site  preferred  by  Lockheed-Martin  for  final  development  of  a 
national  spaceport.  The  required  infrastructure,  including  water,  wastewater  treatment,  and  surface  access, 
is  critical  to  a  successful  site  location.  Funding  for  spaceport  infrastructure  will  be  secured  from  the  autho- 
rized sale  of  $20  million  in  state  bonds,  payable  from  state  revenues  derived  from  VentureStar  operations. 

BENEFITS 

The  VentureStar  Reusable  Launch  Vehicles  (RLV)  project  is  the  next  evolutionary  stage  in  space  vehicles. 
A  prototype  one-half  scale  demonstration  vehicle,  the  X-33,  is  scheduled  for  test  landings  in  Montana  in 
1 999.  As  a  replacement  for  the  aging  space  shuttles  and  conventional  rockets,  the  VentureStar  project  will 
provide  space  transport  for  the  next  century,  with  both  passenger  and  cargo  (satellite)  capabilities.  The 
projected  labor  force  of  2,000  -  3,000  employees  would  not  only  provide  a  unique  opportunity  for  Mon- 
tana workers  and  our  university  graduates  to  secure  well-paid  positions,  but  a  site  location  in  Montana 
would  inevitably  result  in  additional  aerospace  industries  being  attracted  to  the  state.  With  a  successful  site 
location  of  a  VentureStar  spaceport  in  Montana,  aerospace  operations  would  become  a  major  industry  with 
unprecedented  revenue  potential  to  the  state.  Significant  employment  and  revenue  opportunities  would  be 
forever  lost  if  Montana  is  unable  to  provide  a  reasonable  and  competitive  location  incentive  package.

ACTION  NEEDED 

Provide  staff  to  research  legislative  issues,  grant  funding,  and  matching  costs  regarding  the  development  and 
establishment  of  a  Cooperative  Development  Center. 

BENEFITS 

There  is  an  excellent  potential  for  the  development  of  agriculture  producer-owned  cooperatives  in  Montana. 
Research  into  cooperative  laws  in  Montana  and  the  creation  of  a  Cooperative  Development  Center  will  help  in 
the  development  and  expansion  of  "new  generation"  cooperatives.  The  center  will  focus  on  producer-owned 
cooperatives  that  help  to  add  value  to  agriculture  commodities  produced  in  the  state.

Chuck  Merja,  Chairman 
Vision  2005  Task  Force  on 
Agriculture 


ACTION  NEEDED 

Identify  funding  sources  already  available  in  Montana.  Increase  Montana 

Growth  Through  Agriculture  funding  for  grant  programs  aimed  specifically  at  agricultural  business  feasibility 

studies,  marketing  studies,  and  business  plan  development. 

Allocate  funds  for  low-interest  and  guaranteed  loan  programs  through  the  Board  of  Investments  aimed  at 
Montana  businesses,  with  a  portion  of  the  board's  in-state  investments  to  be  managed  specifically  for 
agricultural  businesses. 

BENEFITS 

Agriculture  is  and  will  continue  to  be  an  important  foundation  of  the  state's  economy.  In  order  to  maintain 
and  expand  that  base,  Montana  must  be  willing  to  reinvest  in  its  largest  industry.  Key  to  agricultural  busi- 
ness expansion  in  Montana  is  the  development  of  low-cost,  long-term  capital  for  investment  in  agriculture. 
Often,  an  entrepreneur  has  an  excellent  product,  but  needs  help  in  developing  a  feasibility  study  or  market 
analysis.  Providing  grants  within  the  existing  Montana  Growth  Through  Agriculture  program  aimed  specifi- 
cally at  assisting  businesses  with  feasibility  studies,  marketing,  business  plans,  and  business  development 
activities,  gives  agricultural  businesses  the  chance  to  succeed  and  obtain  funding  from  lending  institutions.  In 
addition,  the  Department  of  Agriculture  will  work  with  the  Board  of  Investments  to  provide  low-interest 
financing  for  agricultural  projects  and  business  ventures.

ACTION  NEEDED 

Authorize  an  income  tax  credit  for  job  training  for  new  employment. 

BENEFITS 

Many  of  the  workplace  skills  required  in  today's  growing  technological  economy  require  specific  on-the-job 
or  specialized  training.  Realizing  the  importance  of  specific  technical  training  for  new  and  expanding  indus- 
tries, 46  states  provide  incentives  to  companies  to  train  their  employees  to  meet  new  skill  requirements. 
Such  skill  training  and  the  incentives  to  provide  it  has  consistently  ranked  as  a  top  priority  for  new  and  ex- 
panding companies.  A  recent  survey  of  the  nation's  manufacturers  indicated  that  inadequate  technical  skills 
were  the  biggest  reason  leading  to  the  rejection  of  job  applicants.  On-the-job  training  in  technical  skills 
development  will  help  mitigate  this  factor  for  our  employees.  This  strategy  will  lead  to  more  technology 
related  companies  in  the  state  and  provide  important  skills  training  for  many  of  Montana's  citizens.

ACTION  NEEDED 

Use  25%  of  any  revenue  generated  from  the  Foreign  Capital  Depository  Act  for  economic  development 
activities. 

BENEFITS 

Having  the  capability  to  plan  for,  promote,  respond  to,  and  help  create  economic  opportunities  for  our 
citizens  is  critical.  The  extent  to  which  Montana  will  build  a  strong  and  diverse  economy  in  the  2 1  st  century 
will  hinge,  in  piirt,  on  the  strategies  included  in  this  economic  development  process.  Many  of  those  strate- 
gies will  be  funded  with  State  general  funds.  If  Montana  is  successful  in  licensing  one  or  several  Foreign 
Capital  Depositories,  part  of  the  revenue  from  this  activity  would  be  reserved  for  economic  development 
activities  like  the  initiatives  outlined  in  this  strategic  planning  process. 

Other  states  understand  the  importance  of  activities  that  help  create  good  employment  and  a  robust 
economy  and  set  aside  specific  funding  sources  to  achieve  these  goals — everything  from  state  lottery 
proceeds,  a  portion  of  the  state  sales  tax,  resource  taxes,  and  others.  Contrary  to  the  belief  of  some, 
economic  growth,  diversity,  stability,  and  good  jobs  for  our  citizens  are  in  large  measure  a  product  of  state 
and  kxal  inve.stments  as  well  as  sound  policy.

BENEFITS 

Montana  producers  grow  and  raise  some  of  the  highest  quality  crops  and  livestock  in  the  nation.  However, 
they  are  not  always  paid  a  premium  for  their  products.  To  ease  the  burden  and  meet  the  need  to  market 
commodities  in  a  fast-paced  global  economy,  increased  marketing  assistance  both  from  the  Montana  De- 
piirtment  of  Agriculture  and  from  commodity  organizations  throughout  the  state  can  serve  as  a  conduit  and 
provide  research  into  new  and  existing  markets.  The  Department  will:  1 )  detemiine  international  and  do-

BENEFITS 

One  of  the  greatest  challenges  to  the  success  of  small  and  medium-sized  manufacturing  companies  in  Mon- 
tana is  finding  reliable  and  profitable  markets  for  their  finished  goods.  It  is  no  longer  good  enough  to  be  a 
supplier  to  one  or  several  large  companies.  Today's  world  markets  demand  miirketing  strategies  that  im- 
prove profits  by  targeting  specific  markets  and  customers  with  products  and  services  that  are  tailored  to  the 
needs  of  their  customers.  In  order  to  have  a  chance  at  success,  quality  at  the  right  price  is  necessary.  Ex- 
posing the  right  market  to  a  manufacturer's  product  is  critical  to  the  success  of  the  company.  Appropriate 
training,  exposure  through  trade  shows  and  other  avenues,  and  access  to  experts  knowledgeable  about  key 
markets  are  a  necessary  component  to  a  strong  and  competitive  manufacturing  sector  in  the  Montana 
economy.  Effectively  implementing  these  strategies  will  sustain  and  create  better  jobs  in  Montana,  further 
diversify  our  economy,  and  bring  new  money  into  the  slate  by  expanding  the  reach  of  Montana  business  into 
other  states  and  overseas.

BENEFITS 

This  is  a  critical  component  of  Montana's  overall  economic  development  strategy  to  improve  Montana's 
market  penetration  of  international  markets  for  both  agricultural  and  manufactured  goods.  Exports  ac- 
counted for  approximately  one-third  of  all  U.S.  economic  growth  during  the  last  decade  according  to  a  re- 
cent report  by  the  National  Association  of  Manufacturers.  The  report  also  showed  that  employees  at 
exporting  companies  earn  an  average  15%  more  in  pay  and  33%  more  in  benefits  than  their  counterparts  at 
non-exporting  companies. 

In  1 996,  Montana's  top  markets  for  manufactured  products  were  Canada  ($119.3  million)  and  Japan 
($35.6  million).  Shipments  of  wheat  and  wheat  products  accounted  for  the  bulk  of  Montana's  agricultural 
export  sales  ($746.1  million),  with  the  leading  export  market  being  Japan.

Provide  cooperative  loans.  Develop  successful  franchises.  Provide  information  and  business  assistance 
services  to  members  of  the  public,  producers,  and  regulatory  agencies. 

BENEFITS 

Hog  production  is  shifting  gradually  from  the  midwestem  states  to  western  states.  In  order  for  Montana  to 
take  advantage  of  this  change,  the  State  needs  to  take  a  proactive  approach  in  developing  confinement  hog 
facilities  within  its  borders.  Facilities  can  be  environmentally  friendly  while  increasing  producer  income  and 
employing  members  of  the  community.  The  Montana  Pork  Producers  Council  has  already  begun  work  to 
develop  the  appropriate  business  system.  By  working  together,  both  grain  and  hog  producers  can  benefit 
from  an  increase  in  Montana's  hog  industry.

BENEFITS 

The  sheep  industry  in  Montana  has  declined  in  recent  years,  partly  due  to  economic  changes  in  some  of  the 
key  wool  markets.  In  order  to  sustain  and  increase  the  sheep  industry  in  the  state,  it  is  important  that  Mon-

BENEFITS 

Montana's  agricultural  research  is  largely  based  at  the  state's  land  grant  University,  Montana  State  Univer-

provides  vital  information  for  producers  looking  to  improve  their  income  by  expanding  or  improving  their 
production.  In  order  to  make  research  more  applicable  to  both  the  producer  and  consumers,  an  opportu- 
nity exists  to  focus  research  not  only  on  producer  needs,  but  on  consumer  desires  as  well.  Research 
provides  the  perfect  conduit  to  produce  a  commodity  appropriate  for  our  climate  that  the  producer  wants 
and  the  consumer  will  buy.

ACTION  NEEDED 

Pass  legislation  to  establish  a  pennanent  science  advisory  commission  attached  to  the  Governor's  Office 
and  staffed  by  the  Department  of  Commerce.  The  commission  will  have  nine  members,  seven  voting  mem- 
bers and  two  ex  officio  members.  Four  members  will  be  permanent,  with  five  members  appointed  by  the 
Governor. 


BENEFITS 

Technology  offers  Montana  a  chance  to  break  away  from  the  state's  traditional  economic  constraints  of 
geographic  location,  unpredictable  commodities  miirkets,  and  sparse  population.  Creating  a  broader  com- 
mercial base,  focusing  on  technology  development  and  utilization  will  increa.se  per  capita  income,  job  choice 
for  Montana  workers,  and  predictability  for  State  revenues.  Research  skills  are  increasingly  critical  to 
workers  in  the  coming  century  as  industry  moves  toward  a  higher  reliance  on  intellectual  capital  and  produc- 
tion through  technology.  Providing  environments  where  students  and  workers  can  develop  research  skills 
prepares  Montanans  for  careers  that  pay  higher  salaries  and  provides  the  foundation  for  building  the  state's 
technology  capacity.  Helping  Montana's  economy  and  its  workers  transition  into  a  work  environment  based 
in  technology  will  be  a  long-term  effort  requiring  sufficient  human,  financial,  and  time  resources  to  realize  the 

full  benefits  to  Montana.

ACTION  NEEDED 

Continue  to  provide  experienced  manufacturing  engineering  expertise  at  a  reduced  cost  to  small  manufactur- 
ing companies  thi-ough  the  Montana  Manufacturing  Extension  Center  (MMEC)  at  Montana  State  University. 
Engineers  are  assigned  regions  of  the  state  and  are  located  in  Missoula,  Kalispell,  Helena,  Bozeman,  and 
Billings.  This  funding  will  provide  partial  match  for  $508,000  in  federal  revenue  expected  each  year  for  the 
nextbiennium. 

BENEFITS 

Montana  was  one  of  the  last  states  to  initiate  a  manufacturing  extension  program  sponsored  in  part  by  the 
National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology.  The  pace  of  change  in  manufacturing  methods  and  technol- 
ogy requires  that  Montana's  small  manufacmrers  receive  professional  engineering  assistance  in  order  to  meet 
the  challenge  of  worid  competition.  Without  this  assistance,  manufacturing  companies  from  other  states  and 
countries  will,  overtime,  produce  superior  products  at  lower  costs.  By  improving  the  efficiency  of  our  small 
manufacturing  companies,  they  will  realize  increased  profits,  there  will  be  more  long-tcmi  jobs  with  better 
wages,  and  revenues  for  state  and  local  governments  will  rise.  Small  Montana  manufacturers  receiving  tech- 
nical assistance  from  MMEC  in  1 997  reported  additional  capital  investments  of  approximately  $3  million  as 
a  direct  result  of  that  assistance  with  projected  increased  sales  exceeding  $5  million  annually.

BENEFITS 

Montana  has  a  number  of  programs  throughout  the  state  geared  toward  helping  producers,  processors, 
wholesalers,  and  retailers.  In  order  to  utilize  those  programs  most  effectively  in  business  recruitment,  devel- 
opment, and  expansion,  it  is  key  that  all  programs  work  in  concert  to  provide  expertise  in  their  respective

apprenticeship  programs  to  be  responsive  to  the  changing  needs  of  the  industries. 

BENEFITS 

Securing  a  dependable  source  of  apprenticeship  training  funding  will  ensure  a  continual  supply  of  skilled 
workers  to  meet  the  labor  needs  of  new  and  expanding  Montana  businesses.  It  will  also  provide 
Montanans  with  better  opportunities  for  secure  and  high-paying  skilled  jobs. 

Apprenticeship  training  is  an  important  method  of  providing  work  force  skills  for  certain  types  of  occupa-

provide  an  incentive  to  employers  to  continue  their  commitment  to  provide  training  and  long-term  employ- 
ment for  Montanans.  It  will  help  offset  the  high  cost  carried  by  employers  and  labor  organization  training 
committees. 

Currently,  there  are  420  independent  sponsor  employers  and  340  union  sponsors  that  have  registered 
apprenticeship  programs,  with  52%  of  the  apprentices  working  for  non-union  sponsors  and  48%  working  in

directly  to  rural  areas  and  Native  American  reservations. 

BENEFITS 

Improve  access  to  entrepreneurial  training  programs  by  utilizing  new  communication  technology.  The  goal  is 
to  bring  assistance  to  airal  businesses  rather  than  make  them  travel  long  distances  to  attend  workshops,

There  is  a  legitimate  need  to  evaluate  a  program  for  new  businesses  to  access  SummitNet.  Costs  for 
Internet  access  are  prohibitive  in  some  areas  of  Montana.  Since  the  State  has  SummitNet  access  points  in 
every  county,  it  is  technically  feasible  to  give  new  businesses  the  opportunity  to  connect  to  SummitNet. 
Connection  fees  would  be  the  responsibility  of  individual  businesses.

Continue  efforts  of  the  Montana  Home  Ownership  Partnership  to  reduce  the  cost  of  new  house  construc- 
tion. 

BENEFITS 

The  first  strategy  will  result  in  an  increased  amount  of  affordable  rental  housing.  Affordable  housing  for  low- 
income  individuals  is  at  a  crisis  stage. 

The  second  strategy  will  make  affordable  homes  available  and  reverse  the  downward  trend  of  Montana's 
home  ownership  rate.  In  1990,  Montana  ranked  1 2th  in  the  nation  for  home  ownership.  In  1996,  Montana 
fell  to  20th  in  the  nation. 

Nonprofit  entities  using  Low  Income  Housing  Tax  Credits  to  develop  property  would  receive  a  property  tax 
exemption,  allowing  them  to  reduce  rents  for  low-income  tenants.  Since  these  aie  true  public  purpose 
projects,  they  are  serving  the  lowest  income  people  in  the  state.  Property  taxes  generally  cost  projects  $50 
to  $75  per  unit  per  month,  which  is  passed  on  to  the  tenants,  making  affordable  rents  harder  to  achieve. 

The  Montana  Home  Ownership  Partnership  project  is  estimated  to  save  over  $5,000  per  home  on  new 
construction,  if  a  house  is  built  using  all  available  cost-saving  factors.  Montanans  can  find  out  what  they 
need  to  know  when  building  a  house,  including  the  cost-saving  factors,  by  using  the  House  Plan  book.  This 
book  will  contain  house  plans  specifically  designed  for  Montana,  have  energy  efficiency  factors  built  in,  and 
include  information  on  how  to  go  about  selecting  a  lot,  obtaining  financing,  and  other  pertinent  information.

ACTION  NEEDED 

To  provide  state  cost  share  for  large  regional  rural  water  systems,  the  State  needs  to  authorize  two  pro- 
posed water  districts  and  a  funding  source  to  generate  needed  project  revenue. 

BENEFITS 

The  Department  of  Natural  Resources  and  Conservation  in  concert  with  the  departments  of  Commerce  and 
Environmental  Quality  have  been  working  with  the  North  Central  Montana  Regional  Water  System  Coordi- 
nating Committee  to  evaluate  a  proposed  regional  water  system.  The  system  would  provide  high  quality 
water  to  20  smaller  rural  water  and  community  systems  in  northcentral  Montana  and  provide  the  Rocky 
Boy  Reservation  with  a  municipal  water  system.  The  estimated  cost  of  this  system  is  $200  million.  At  this 
time,  the  Coordinating  Committee  is  seeking  $  1 60  million  in  federal  funds,  $20  million  in  state  funds,  and 
$20  million  in  local  funds.  Several  communities  that  would  be  served  by  this  system  are  out  of  compUance 
with  the  federal  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act.  Several  more  communities  will  be  out  of  compliance  in  the  near 
future.  Groundwater  in  the  area  is  generally  unsuitable  for  a  drinking  water  supply.  Furthermore,  stand- 
alone treatment  plants  are  estimated  to  cost  more  over  the  planning  horizon  than  the  proposed  regional 
system.  The  source  of  water  for  the  proposed  system  is  Tiber  Reservoir. 

A  second  regional  water  system  is  also  being  reviewed.  While  not  as  far  along  at  the  state  level,  the 
Fort  Peck  Tribal/Dry  Prairie  Water  District  system  is  seeking  federal  authorization,  and  hearings  were 
conducted  last  summer.  This  system  would  provide  high  quality  drinking  water  throughout  the  Fort  Peck 
Reservation.  At  this  time,  the  total  project  cost  is  estimated  to  be  $  1 80  million  with  $  1 60  million  in  federal 
funding,  $  1 0  million  in  state  funding,  and  $  1 0  million  in  local  funds.  Ground  water  in  the  area  is  poor,  and 
some  communities  in  the  area  are  out  of  compliance.  Those  communities  that  are  in  compliance  and  use 
ground  water  have  significant  problems  with  sulfates  and  other  impurities.  The  source  of  water  for  the 
proposed  system  is  the  Missouri  River  below  Fork  Peck  Reservoir.

BENEFITS 

Annual  funding  cycles  would  enable  local  governments  to  use  funds  more  effectively  by  reducing  project

that  it  is  common  to  have  three  or  more 
funding  sources  in  addition  to  increased 
customer  rates.  Because  the  Treasure 
State  Endowment  awards  are  made  on  a 
biennial  basis,  other  funding  sources, 
including  state  and  federal  sources,  are 
put  on  hold  pending  decisions  made  onl\ 
once  every  two  years  in  the  Legislature. 
Ultimately,  this  increases  costs  through 
inflationary  factors  and  planning  difficul-

Develop  a  comprehensive  state  policy  for  signage  to  local  tourism  locations  as  well  as  rest  areas  and  gas  to 
meet  the  needs  of  out-of-state  visitors  and  local  communities.  Signage  is  particular  important  in  light  of  the 
cunent  and  growing  interest  in  the  Lewis  and  Clark  Corps  of  Discovery. 

BENEFITS 

Over  9()9f  of  the  visitors  to  Montana  arrive  by  personal  auto  or  RV.  A  large  portion  of  the  remaining 
visitors  rent  vehicles  in  Montana.  Visitor  satisfaction  surveys  conducted  by  the  Institute  of  Tourism  and 
Recreation  Research  continually  point  to  the  need  for  better  signage.  Similarly,  other  studies  have  indicated 
that  visitors  rely  on  road  and  directional  signs  to  lead  them  to  attractions.  Montana' s  neighboring  states 
appear  to  have  a  far  more  unified  and  comprehensive  system  to  identify  major  attractions  for  motorists  than 
is  the  case  in  Montana.  In  addition,  communities  throughout  the  state  also  seem  to  have  difficulty  w  ith  the 
current  .system. 

A  well  designed  and  maintained  signage  system  would  result  in  more  visitation  to  attractions,  increased 
lengths  of  stay  for  visitors,  and  increased  employment  and  revenues  to  the  state.  The  average  visitor  group 
currently  spends  $  1 20  per  day  in  Montana.  Increasing  the  length  of  stay  would  have  a  tremendous

developing  new  community  leaders,  issues  of  growth  and  decline,  job  development,  housing,  sewer,  water,

ACTION  NEEDED 

Revitalization  of  downtown  commercial  districts  is  an  effective  activity  for  stabilizing  and  enhancing  commu- 
nity economies.  There  are  currently  43  states  that  operate  statewide  programs  to  assist  and  support  nearly 
1 ,400  active  local  Main  Street  Programs.  In  addition  to  economic  benefits,  the  Main  Street  Program 
preserves  historic  structures  and  generates  renewed  community  pride.  The  program,  which  operates  in  both 
the  United  States  and  Canada,  is  an  effective  response  to  declining  downtown  districts,  business  dislocation, 
and  resulting  out  migration. 

BENEFITS 

By  creating  and  supporting  a  Montana  Main  Street  Program,  the  State  has  an  opportunity  to  halt  economic 
and  structural  deterioration,  especially  in  our  small  towns.  The  comprehensive  process,  which  requires 
active  human  and  financial  participation  by  local  citizens,  is  designed  to  be  a  self-sustaining  effort.  Long- 
temi  benefits  include  commercial  stabilization,  population  retention,  and  creation  of  an  attractive  cominunity

ACTION  NEEDED 

To  create  a  balanced  tax  structure  and  efficient,  equitable  tax  policies.  Generally,  balance  in  a  tax  system 
means  that  many  different  tax  bases  are  used;  taxes  are  broad-based  with  a  minimum  of  exclusions  and 
deductions;  tax  rates  are  lower,  resulting  in  less  distortion  of  economically  efficient  decisions;  revenue  is  less 
volatile;  tax  adjustments  can  be  made  in  small  increments  with  minimal  economic  and  administrative  distur- 
bance; and  taxes  do  not  affect  significant  business  decisions. 

BENEFITS 

A  balanced  tax  system  creates  desirable  conditions  for  business  development  and  allows  the  state  to 
compete  for  jobs  with  other  states  and  countries.  A  balance  among  sources  and  tax  types  ensures  stable 
revenue  and  avoids  a  concentration  of  tax  burdens  on  a  few  sources,  which  can  make  tax  rates  distort 
economic  behavior.

and  to  allow  a  wider  range  of  Montana  businesses  to  participate. 

BENEFITS 

One-Stop  Business  Licensing  significantly  reduces  the  time  and  effort  for  a  business  to  complete  license/

BENEFITS 

This  legislation  will  streamline  the  process  for  Hcensees  as  well  as  the  Professional  and  Occupational  Licens- 
ing Division  (POL)  by  using  the  Internet  as  a  management  tool. 

Once  all  databases  are  converted,  a  web  page  would  allow  consumers  to  query  the  status  of  licensees.  This 
will  be  extremely  useful  to  the  public,  for  example,  from  someone  who  may  need  to  select  a  physician  in  a 
new  city  to  someone  looking  for  a  parent  who  is  not  paying  child  support  and  may  be  licensed  in  the  state. 
Depending  on  the  information  placed  on  the  web  page,  the  license  number,  home  address,  and  work 
address  may  be  available  to  consumers.  This  system  was  created  to  expand  and  enhance  the  current 
program  and  to  combine  all  data  from  every  database  in  POL. 

Once  all  databases  are  incorporated  into  the  new  Oracle  .system,  POL  will  create  a  web  page  that  will

Implement  a  customer  assistance  training  program  for  state  and  local  government  employees  whose  jobs

A  comprehensive  training  program  would  focus  on  providing  quality  customer  service  through  effective,

BENEFITS 

By  current  estimates,  over  6,000  state  and  local  government  jobs  include  regulatory  activity.  For  many 
citizens  and  businesses,  their  primary  contacts  with  government  involve  regulatory  issues.  From  these 
contacts  come  many  of  the  complaints  about  "bureaucracy,"  "regulatory  madness,"  and  "gobbledygook." 
The  concept  of  the  regulated  entity  as  the  "government's  customer"  is  new  to  government  employees,  and 
few  of  them  have  ever  received  any  training  in  customer  service.  By  working  with  government  employees  to 
improve  communication  and  service  skills,  the  State  can  create  a  friendlier  business  environment.  This 
doesn't  mean  that  people  and  businesses  wouldn't  have  to  abide  by  regulations.  Rather,  it  means  that
