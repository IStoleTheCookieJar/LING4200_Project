NOTES 


ABOUT THIS PUBLICATION This publication presents a summary of statistics on grape and wine production and 
related activities collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and from other 


sources. 


CHANGES IN THIS ISSUE Significant changes have been made to the content and presentation of this publication 
in consultation with users. As a result, data previously presented for Prices, Consumption 
of Alcohol per Capita, Expenditure and World Comparisons are no longer included in 


this publication. Some additional changes are listed below. 


Viticulture Due to the methodological changes to the Vineyards Survey, viticulture tables present 
data for wine grape production only and for a reduced number of grape varieties. Users 
should be aware that these changes mean that data for Vineyards, 2008-09 are not 


directly comparable with data for previous years. 


Sub-state data based on Geographical Indication (GI) Zones and derived zones 


previously presented in this publication can now be found in an attached datacube. 
Wine Surveys Tables relating to Brandy data have been excluded. 


International Trade Tables presenting the imports and exports of Australian wine of selected countries have 


been combined to better reflect the trade relationship of selected countries. 
SOURCE MATERIAL All sources cited refer to ABS publications and/or ABS data available on request. 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT The continuing collection of varietal data is supported by Australia’s grape-growers and 
winemakers and the Australian government through the Grape and Wine Research and 


Development Corporation. 


ROUNDING Where figures have been rounded, discrepancies may occur between sums of the 


component items and totals.

OVERVIEW There were 1.7 million tonnes of grapes crushed in the 2008-09 financial year, a decrease 
of 0.1 million tonnes (5.4%) on the previous financial year. Consistent with this decline, 
the area of grape bearing vines fell to 157 thousand hectares and yields fell to 10.7 


tonnes per hectare at 30 June 2009. 


There were 1.2 billion litres of beverage wine produced in 2008-09, a decrease of 74.8 
million litres (5.9%) compared to 2007-08. 


In contrast, 2008-09 exports of Australian produced wine rose 5.2% to 752 million litres 
as compared to the previous financial year while domestic sales of Australian wine also 
increased by 0.6% to 430 million litres. The 2008-09 inventory values increased by 0.1% to 
1.9 billion litres from 2007-08. Imports of wine into Australia rose 16.7% to 62 million 


litres in 2008-09, up from 53 million litres reported in 2007-08.

INTRODUCTION 1. This publication presents final estimates from the ABS collections: Inventories of 
Australian Wine and Brandy, 2008-09, Wine and Spirit Production, 2008-09 (Annual Wine 
Survey), Sales of Australian Wine by Winemakers, 2008-09 and Vineyards, 2009. Not all 
data from these collections are published here. Some further data are available for a 
charge, on application to the ABS. 


2. This publication is a summary of statistics on grape and wine production and related 
activities collected by the ABS and from other sources. Some of the data used in this 
publication were obtained from various ABS collections for which publications with 
appropriate Explanatory Notes are already available. The bibliography contains a list of 
these publications. 


3 The Viticulture tables replace the previous publication Viticulture, Australia 

(cat. no. 7310.0) and contain information on area of vines and production of red and 
white grapes for the 2009 season. The continuing collection of varietal data is supported 
by Australia's grape-growers and winemakers and the Australian government through the 
Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. 


4 Differences exist between the grape production intended for winemaking reported 
by grape growers in the viticulture collection and the quantity of fresh grapes crushed by 
winemakers reported in the Wine and Spirit Production Collection. Differences in the 
collection methodologies, as outlined below, mean some difference should always be 
apparent between the series. 


SCOPE AND COVERAGE OF 5 Viticultural statistics relate to the year in which the harvest occur. 


VITICULTURE SURVEY : ; é : 
6 Prior to the 1999 collection, an exercise was undertaken to increase the number of 


known growers included in the collection. The improved coverage, of over 
1,000 growers, means that the data presented for 1999 and later years are not directly 
comparable with data for previous years. 


7 Incontrast to previous years, the 2009 Vineyards collection was undertaken using a 
survey methodology and collected information on the major wine grape varieties only. 
The scope of 2009 Vineyards Survey was agricultural businesses recorded on the ABS 
Business Register (ABSBR) above a minimum size cut-off. The ABSBR is based on the 
Australian Business Register (ABR) which is administered and maintained by the 
Australian Taxation Office (ATO). This business based frame replaces the land based 
frame previously used for the Vineyards collection. The methodological changes mean 
that the data presented for 2009 are not directly comparable with previous years. 


8 Tasmanian data are collected in partnership with the Department of Primary 
Industries and Water. The scope of the collected data is the same as for other states. 


9 Viticultural statistics are presented on an Australian Geographical Indications basis in 
this issue. The Geographical Indications are official descriptions of Australian wine zones, 
regions and sub-regions which are defined in the Australian Wine and Brandy 
Corporation Act, 1980. The zones and regions listed in the following table were provided 
to the ABS by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The list includes those 
regions which had been determined at the time of the Vineyards 2009 Survey. 


10 For more detail on Australian Geographical Indications including maps of the 
zones and regions contact the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation web site

SCOPE AND COVERAGE OF 11 Winemakers who crush 50 tonnes or more of grapes are included in the Wine and 

WINE SURVEYS Spirit Production collection. Wine production data are collected from these winemakers 
on a winery (location) basis to allow for state and regional data output. The grapes 
crushed by these wineries includes grapes owned by others and crushed on a 
commission or contract basis, often for wine producers who do not have their own 


crushing facilities. 


12 Winemakers who crush more than 400 tonnes of grapes are included in the 
Inventories of Australian Wine and Brandy collection. These details on inventories of 
Australian beverage wine by wine type are collected at 30 June. 


13 All inventories data are collected on an Australia-wide basis only and state figures 
are therefore not available. Inventories data collected from 1996 include all 
Australian-produced wines owned by these winemakers and held anywhere in Australia. 
In years previous to 1996, inventories included only those Australian-produced wines 
held by winemakers on any of their own premises, regardless of ownership. This change 
in the measurement of inventories means that data for 1996 and later are not directly 
comparable with earlier years. 


14 It is possible that inventories data may vary slightly each year as new wineries, with 
either large or small inventories, come into the scope of the collection. In particular, the 
published (i.e. closing) inventories figures for any one year may not equate with the 
opening inventories for the following year. 

15 Winemakers with sales of 250,000 litres or more in either of the previous two years 
are included in the Sales of Australian Wine by Winemakers collection. All sales data are 
collected on an Australia-wide basis only and state figures are therefore not available. 

16 The wine content of products consisting of a mixture of wine and fruit juice, 
commonly known as ‘coolers’, is included in the appropriate wine category of the wine 
from which it is made, which is generally table wine. 


ACKNOWLEDGMENT 17. ABS publications draw extensively on information provided freely by individuals, 
businesses, governments and other organisations. Their continued cooperation is very 
much appreciated: without it, the wide range of statistics published by the ABS would 
not be available. Information received by the ABS is treated in strict confidence as 
required by the Census and Statistics Act 1905. 


ABS PUBLICATIONS 18 Current publications and other products released by the ABS are available from the 
ABS web site <http:\\www.abs.gov.au>. The ABS also issues a daily Release Advice on 
the web site which details products to be released in the week ahead. The ABS may have 
other relevant data available on request. Inquiries should be made to the National 
Information and Referral Service on 1300 135 070.

GLOSSARY 


Table, sparkling and fortified wine produced for direct consumption and not for 
distillation. 


The spirit obtained by the distillation of wine in such a manner as to ensure that the 
spirit possesses the taste, aroma and other characteristics generally attributed to brandy, 
in acordance with the requirements set out in the Schedule to this Standard. 


Normally fermented wine in which the alcohol has been removed and which retains all 
other components. 


Wine used for the purpose of distillation into grape spirit. 


All sales of Australian produced wine by winemakers within the scope of the Sales of 
Australian Wine by Winemakers survey, whether they be wholesale or retail sales, or 
bulk sales to other wineries outside of the scope of the survey. Excluded are 
inter-winery sales, sales where the wine will be exported, sales to other winemakers with 
on-site crushing facilities, sales for ship and aircraft stores, sales of imported wine and 
the volume of imported wine blended with Australian wine sold domestically. 


Exports of wine to overseas ports including sales made by exporters and wine producers. 
Parts of the distillate which are not useable. 


Wine to which grape spirit has been added, thereby adding alcoholic strength and 
precluding further fermentation. Fortified wine must contain at least 150 millilitres/litre 
and not more than 200 millilitres/litre of ethanol at 20° Centigrade. 


The connection of two pieces of living plant tissue, so that they unite and grow as one 
plant. 


Alcohol spirit of vinous origin used in fortification or as a base for grape flavoured spirits. 
The spirit is obtained from the distillation of wine, by-products of winemaking or the 
fermented liquor of a mash of dried grapes and contains methanol in a proportion not 
exceeding 3 grams per litre at 20° Centigrade of the ethanol content. 


Imported goods brought into the country for consumption or further processing, but 
excluding goods imported with the reasonable expectation of re-export within a limited 
time. 


The area of vines, reported on the ABS Vineyards collection form, grape growers intend 
to plant or graft after the current harvest, but before the next harvest. 


Wine in which the alcohol content has been deliberately reduced or wine which has 
been produced with a lower alcohol level using either dilution or partial fermentation. 


The residue of grape skins and seeds after the juice has been extracted. 


This category refers to grape production that is not used for either winemaking or 
drying. 
The product of complete or partial fermentation of wine with contained sugars that has 


become surcharged with carbon dioxide. 


A sweet, clear, non-alcoholic liquid. Winemakers use the term to refer to must which has 
undergone clarification and stabilisation. 


Table or sparkling wine which must contain at least 80 millilitres/litre of ethanol at 
20° Centigrade. Unfortified wines rely solely on fermentation for their alcoholic strength.
