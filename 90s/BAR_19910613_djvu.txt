SAN FRANCISCO, CA 


Guadalajara 
Mayor Kills 
Gay Meeting 

Delegates Threatened With Arrest 


by Rex Wockner 

The 13th World Confer¬ 
ence of the International Les¬ 
bian and Gay Association has 
been cancelled after the may¬ 
or of Guadalajara, Mexico, 
promised he would have all 
the delegates arrested for “im¬ 
moral behavior.” 

The conference was to 
have been held June 30-July 6 
in Guadalajara. 

Mayor Gabriel Covarru- 
bias Ibarra also promised on 
June 12 to withhold police 
protection for the conference, 
which had been threatened 
by right-wing elements in the 
city. 

And he forced the host ho¬ 
tel to cancel its contract with 
ILGA and decreed that any 
other hotel that agreed to 
host the conference would be 
shut down by police. 

The mayor of Guadala¬ 
jara’s wealthiest suburb and 
the governor of the state of 
Jalisco joined Covarrubias 
Ibarra in promising to take all 
steps necessary to prevent the 
conference. 

The cancellation comes de¬ 
spite support for the confer¬ 
ence from Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari and 
the Mexican National Human 
Rights Commission, and de¬ 
spite guarantees in the Mexi¬ 
can Constitution of U.S.-style 
freedom of assembly. 

“After having tried every 
possible way to save the con¬ 
ference, it was decided with 
great sadness by the organiz¬ 
ing committee and ILGA offi¬ 
cers that the conference had 
to be cancelled,” said ILGA 
Information Secretary Micha 
Ramakers, speaking from 
Brussels. 

“ILGA most strongly con¬ 
demns this utterly homopho¬ 


bic attitude on the part of the 
local and state governments 
and urges everyone con¬ 
cerned about human rights to 
protest to the Mexican gov¬ 
ernments,” Ramakers said. 

ILGA Co-Secretary Gener¬ 
al Lisa Power, speaking from 
London, said the mess in 
Guadalajara “shows how 
much the international les¬ 
bian and gay movement is 
needed. Neither the Mexican 
authorities nor any others will 
stop us fighting oppression 
and homophobia,” she said. 
“The loss of the conference 
only increases our determina¬ 
tion.” 

Conference organizer Jorge 
Romero Mendoza of Guadala¬ 
jara’s Grupo Orgullo Homo¬ 
sexual de Liberacion (Homo¬ 
sexual Pride Liberation 
Group said, “We are out¬ 
raged by the actions of the 
homophobic authorities here. 
But they must not think we 
will be stopped from fighting 
them. We urge everybody to 
demonstrate at their local 
Mexican embassy and spread 
the news in their local me¬ 
dia.” 

The loss of ILGA’s annual 
conference comes as the orga¬ 
nization faces “a financial cri¬ 
sis” brought on by its rapid 
growth. Almost 100 national 
and local gay/lesbian organi¬ 
zations have joined ILGA in 
the past two years, many 
from poverty-stricken “Third 
World” nations where activists 
cannot afford to pay ILGA 
membership dues. 

The problem is exacerbat¬ 
ed by the costs of internation¬ 
al communication. ILGA’s ex¬ 
penses are expected to out¬ 
strip its income this year by 
$13,000. The organization has 
no savings.

Activists Protest Cairns Ruling 
With 'Lie-In' at Mayor's Office 


by Dennis Conkin 

A dozen lesbian and gay 
activists from the “Bad Cop- 
No Donut” police misconduct 
focus group staged a takeover 
in the lobby of Mayor Art Ag¬ 
nos’ office on May 10. 

The activists staged the ac¬ 
tion in protest of the disci¬ 
plinary sentence meted out to 
Capt. Richard Cairns by the 
Police Commission last week. 

The group staged an im¬ 
promptu “lie-in” after unsuc¬ 
cessfully trying to enter 
through a side entrance and 
settling for access to the lob¬ 
by at Room 200. 

The activists made phone 
calls in the office and briefly 
draped a “Bad Cop-No 
Donut” banner over the bal¬ 
cony of the office before they 
were made to leave and a po¬ 
lice guard was stationed at its 
entrance. 

They also stickered the of¬ 
fice door and the outside 
walls with activist slogans. 

Scott Hester, one of the 
protesters, was arrested on a 
citizen’s arrest by mayoral 
staffer Robin Eichman at the 


request of the Police Depart¬ 
ment. 

“Someone had to file a 
complaint, and Robin was the 
only person available,” said 
Scott Shafer, the mayor’s 
press secretary. 

After he was taken into 
custody and cited and re¬ 
leased, Hester returned to the 
Mayor’s Office and placed 


Eichman under citizen’s ar¬ 
rest. Hester plans to take le¬ 
gal action against Eichman. 

Eichman is the director of 
the mayor’s Film Advisory 
Board and was a major player 
in the recent Basic Instinct 
flap. 

“Mayor Agnos said that he 
would be happy to consider

Trial Vaccine Stalls 
Progression of HIV 


United Press International 

BOSTON — By boosting 
their immune systems, an ex¬ 
perimental vaccine apparently 
has stalled the destructive dis¬ 
ease process in some people 
infected with the AIDS virus, 
researchers reported June 12. 

Repeated injections of the 
genetically engineered vac¬ 
cine called gpl60 apparently 
have helped maintain levels 
of key disease-fighting cells in 
some of the 30 volunteers in¬ 
volved in a pilot study for 
more than two years, said Dr. 
Robert Redfield of the Walter 
Reed Army Institute of Re¬ 
search. 

Levels of white blood cells 

First of Two Sections 


known as T-4 cells usually de¬ 
cline as the disease progress¬ 
es. They are killed by the hu¬ 
man immunodeficiency virus, 
which invades and destroys 
them. 

But among 90 percent of 
15 people who received six in¬ 
jections of gpl60 during a six- 
month period, T-4 cell levels 
remained steady for as long 
as 27 months, Redfield and 
co-researchers reported in 
The New England Journal of 
Medicine. 

“We’ve opened the door 
for a new therapeutic strategy 
against AIDS. This is a very 
exciting observation. It proves 
the feasibility of an old idea

Putting United Way's 
Commitment to the Test 


Part Two of Two Parts 
by Keith Clark 

Last week’s story, “United 
Way Pressured About Scout 
Funding,” detailed the lesbian 
and gay community’s often 
stormy relations with the or¬ 
ganization in trying to obtain 
a fair slice of their funds and 
the difficult position the Unit¬ 
ed Way now finds itself in 
vis-a-vis its funding of the Boy 
Scouts. 

The recent court ruling 
that allows the Scouts to ex¬ 
clude gays would seem to put 
that group on a direct colli¬ 
sion course with the written 
non-discrimination policies of 
the United Way, their princi¬ 
pal funding source. Many ac¬ 
tivists and leaders are calling 
upon the United Way to ei¬ 
ther “put up or shut up” 
about those policies. 

United Way funding of les- 
bian/gay services amounts to 
about $370,000 in the entire 
five-county Bay Area, with 
none for lesbian/gay agencies 
in Contra Costa, San Mateo 
or Marin counties. And only 


one agency in Alameda Coun¬ 
ty, the Pacific Center, gets 
UWBA funds. 

That $370,000 amounts to 
only about seven-tenths of 
one percent of the United 
Way’s total $52.3-million bud¬ 
get this year for lesbian/gay 
service agencies, some of 
which are in serious financial 
trouble as demand for ser¬ 
vices continues to outstrip 
severely limited resources, 
and budget-strapped city, 
county and state governments 
cut service funds. 

Agency supporters also 
point out that in addition to 
its gay and lesbian funding, 
UWBA’s money for AIDS-re- 
lated services and agencies in 
the five-county area amounts 
to $1,187,000. 

But as Allan Shore put it, 
“AIDS funding doesn’t have 
anything specific to do with 
gay and lesbian concerns, and 
there’s no way that we can as¬ 
sume that the money going to 
AIDS projects would have 
otherwise gone to gay and les¬ 
bian issues.” 

Also, Shore pointed out, 
the $1.5 million combined gay 


and lesbian and AIDS fund¬ 
ing isn’t that much greater 
than the $1.1 million in fund¬ 
ing for the Boy Scouts locally, 
with $276,000 of that going to 
the Mt. Diablo Boy Scout 
Council itself. 

In eight years, activists and 
community leaders agree, 
United Way should have been 
able to move a bit farther 
than that. Equally intolerable, 
they say, is the failure of 
United Way to enforce its 
own anti-discrimination poli¬ 
cies, meaning that lesbians 
and gay men in the Bay Area 
are actually contributing mon¬ 
ey to agencies that actively 
ban homosexuals from mem¬ 
bership, volunteering and em¬ 
ployment. 

Although clearly lesbian 
and gay leaders involved 
with the United Way are hap¬ 
py to have the spotlight 
turned on the agency’s les¬ 
bian/gay funding and its non¬ 
discrimination policies, the 
general attitude seems to be 
that the coincidental timing of 
the increased funding and the 
Boy Scout court decision is

Court Upholds City's Ban 
On Males Jogging Topless 


United Press International 

WASHINGTON- The 
Supreme Court on June 10 
let stand a local ordinance 
prohibiting males from jog¬ 
ging topless or otherwise ap¬ 
pearing in public without 
wearing shirts. 

The court refused to re¬ 
view the constitutionality of 
a statute from the Village of 
Southampton, N.Y., making 
it illegal for anyone to appear 
on a public street shirtless. 

Matthew Duyck was ar¬ 
rested Sept. 5, 1987, for refus¬ 
ing to wear a shirt. 

Duyck, a local artist who 
often jogged the streets of 
town without a shirt prior to 
the passage of the law, con¬ 
tends it violated his 14th 
Amendment right to choose 
his personal dress. 

But the New York State 
Court of Appeals disagreed, 
upholding the $100 fine im¬ 
posed on Duyck. 

Duyck urged the high 
court to accept the case to de-_ 
termine if a person has a 


“fundamental liberty interest 
in the way he or she dress¬ 
es.” 

Attorneys for the Village 
of Southampton, in Suffolk 
County, said Duyck’s argu¬ 
ment is “off the mark.” 

“The law in question, and 
(Duyck’s) conduct, is about 
being undressed on a public 
street, not choosing a form of 
dress.” The village said its 
law is “gender neutral,” and 
said declaring it illegal would 
have given both men and 
women the right to walk 
around town half nude. 

The high court in the past 
has allowed police depart¬ 
ments to impose grooming 
restrictions on their officers, 
but has not ruled whether 
such restrictions as the Vil¬ 
lage of Southampton im¬ 
posed can apply to the public 
at large. 

The court’s refusal to hear 
the case sets no national prece¬ 
dent, but could give other 
towns encouragement to enact 
such legislation. 

Duyck noted that the 11th 


U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
has struck down a local dress 
code “remarkably similar” to 
Southampton’s. 

But the village said Duy¬ 
ck’s contention the law is un¬ 
constitutional “on its face” 
precluded lower court explo¬ 
ration of what municipal pur¬ 
pose it might serve, and thus 
set the cases apart. 

“This is whimsical and 
frivolous litigation,” attorneys 
for the village wrote. “If, in¬ 
deed, this court stoops to 
concern itself with a matter 
so slight and determines that 
such a federal right exists, 
equal protection will require 
that not only Mr. Duyck but 
all others, male and female, 
of all sizes, shapes and phys¬ 
ical conditions have a similar 
right.” 

The village also warned 
that outlawing the statute 
could have allowed people to 
appear bare-chested in 
“courtrooms, churches, and 
other places where the citi¬ 
zenry at large congregates.”

Cleve Jones 
Makes It Official 

Names Project Founder Enters Assembly Race 


No Consensus 
On Miller Boycott 


by Nancy Boutilier 

Cleve Jones, founder of the 
Names Project, announced 
June 5 that he is seeking the 
16th District Assembly seat. 

Jones said he is running in 
the Democratic Party prima¬ 
ry because issues of vital in¬ 
terest to the district are not 
being properly addressed by 
the Legislature. 

He will face incumbent 
John Burton in the primary. 

“The Legislature is lacking 
a sense of urgency,” Jones 
told the Bay Area Reporter. 
“All of us are frustrated by 
the ‘business-as-usual attitude’ 
in Sacramento. 

“It’s not business as usual 
for children whose schools 
are threatened with closure. 
It’s not business as usual for 
the hundreds of thousands of 
Californians infected with 
HIV. It’s not business as usual 
for the homeless who spend 
their nights sleeping in door¬ 
ways. 

“And it’s not business as 
usual for senior citizens afraid 
to leave their homes after 
dark.” 

Jones, whose work during 
the past 10 years has focused 
on the HIV pandemic, said, 
“One of the sad things about 
the epidemic is that it has illu- 


CSAA 

Recognizes 

Domestic 

Partners 

The National Center for Les¬ 
bian Rights has announced 
that one of California’s major 
auto clubs and car insurance 
providers, the California State 
Automobile Association, has 
adjusted its membership rates 
to recognize families made 
up of non-married domestic 
partners. 

Responding to the “chang¬ 
ing times,” CSAA has begun to 
make their discounted associ¬ 
ate memberships available to 
same-sex couples who live to¬ 
gether. 

To qualify for the discount, 
couples are required to be 
jointly registered on their ve¬ 
hicle, but don’t have to be in¬ 
sured through CSAA. 

According to Robert Ras¬ 
mussen, vice president sales & 
member services, the policy 
was changed in response to 
many more inquiries for asso¬ 
ciate membership from same- 
sex partners. 

Though a notice has been 
sent to all the local offices in¬ 
forming them of the policy, 
nothing yet has been sent to 
CSAA members. 

Earlier this spring, in a set¬ 
tlement of a complaint that 
had been brought by a gay man 
from Seattle, AAA in Wash¬ 
ington state extended its dis¬ 
counted “associate” member¬ 
ship to same-sex partners. 

That complaint, filed with 
the Seattle Human Rights De¬ 
partment, charged that AAA’s 
policy was found to violate 
Seattle’s ordinance which pro¬ 
hibits discrimination based on 
marital status. ▼ 


minated and underscored 
problems that existed all 
along — access to health care 
and health insurance.” 

Jones added, “We need a 
seat at the table.” Noting that 
there are no openly gay mem¬ 
bers of the state Assembly, 
Jones insisted that “this is not 
a campaign about an individ¬ 
ual’s sexual orientation, but it 
is about our community’s as¬ 
pirations.” 

Due to the state’s planned 
reapportionment of electoral 
districts, Jones doesn’t know 
exactly what the 16th District 
will look like come election 
time, and he doesn’t feel he 
has “the luxury of waiting for 
reapportionment lines to be 
drawn.” 

Jones called the present 
district lines “appalling,” and 
although he does believe “fair 
lines can be drawn in San 
Francisco,” he also fears that 



Cleve Jones 


minority groups may be pit¬ 
ted against one another. 

San Francisco has “every 
significant minority popula¬ 
tion, and every one was cut 
exactly in half 10 years ago,” 
Jones said. “It would be wise 
for all of us to pay heed to 
what happens” with reappor¬ 
tionment. Jones stressed that 
now is the time to “seek out 
opportunities to build coali¬ 
tions.” ▼ 


by Michael C. Botkin 

Despite efforts by some 
ACT UP leaders to portray 
the settlement with Philip 
Morris as a done deal and to 
summarily end the boycott of 
the corporation’s subsidiary, 
Miller beer, there appears to 
be little consensus in favor of 
this among activists. 

A conference call June 9 in¬ 
volving 15 ACT UP chapters, 
including those in San Fran¬ 
cisco, New York, Dallas, Los 
Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, At¬ 
lanta and New Orleans, aired 
significant reservations about 
calling off the boycott until 
several vital points have been 
nailed down. 

Michael Petrelis of ACT 
UP/D.C. has intensively lob¬ 
bied the gay/lesbian media to 
describe the Miller boycott as 
over. He urged the Bay Area 
Reporter to print the address 
of Philip Morris’ corporate 
contribution center (120 Park 
Ave., NYC 10017) and to en¬ 


courage AIDS service organi¬ 
zations to submit requests for 
the settlement money. 

According to Petrelis, the 
boycott has effectively ended 
anyway, and Philip Morris 
has agreed to donate $3 
million a year to fight AIDS 
and homophobia. 

ACT UP/San Francisco, 
however, aggressively chal¬ 
lenged Petrelis’ move to end 
the boycott. They circulated a 
four-page letter denouncing 
the proposed settlement to 
other ACT UP chapters and 
organized the conference call 
to discuss it. 

“This was definitely an 
abortion of the process,” said 
Bill Haskell of ACT UP/SF, 
referring to Petrelis’ an¬ 
nouncement of the boycott’s 
end. 

Haskell and others were 
upset that Petrelis simply an¬ 
nounced the deal instead of 
first referring it back to local 
chapters for approval.

CIA Agrees To Reconsider 
Lesbian's Security Clearance 


by Keith Clark 

The attorney for a lesbian 
who has been involved in a 
six-year legal battle with the 
CIA regarding its 1981 refusal 
to grant her a security clear¬ 
ance says the agency has 
agreed to re-evaluate her ap¬ 
plication without concern for 
her sexual orientation. 

Dick Gayer, attorney for 
Julie Dubbs, said the top-se¬ 
cret agency and Justice De¬ 
partment attorneys represent¬ 
ing the government agreed 
last week to pay up to $10,000 
in attorneys’ fees in the. case 
and to reconsider her appli¬ 
cation. 

Gayer said it would be 
“the first time the CIA is con¬ 
sidering a known gay for a 
security clearance.” 

But even so, Gayer said 
the Dubbs-CIA agreement 
may mean nothing more than 
“business as usual” in its dis¬ 
crimination against lesbians 
and gays. 

“One thing you have to re¬ 
alize, and people know it but 
they don’t think about it all 
the time,” Gayer told the Bay 



Julie Dubbs 


Area Reporter, “is the gov¬ 
ernment — the CIA in this 
case — in signing this agree¬ 
ment could be lying through 
its teeth. They could have ev¬ 
ery intention of denying Julie 
Dubbs a clearance no matter 
what they find in the investi¬ 
gation.” 

Dubbs, who works with 
SRI International as a techni¬ 
cal illustrator at the Menlo 
Park-based firm, applied for a 


“sensitive compartmented in¬ 
formation” clearance, one 
grade above “top secret,” in 
1981. 

The CIA finally turned 
down Dubbs’ application 
even though the Defense De¬ 
partment approved her secu¬ 
rity clearance, which is essen¬ 
tial in her job. 

The CIA told Dubbs the 
reason they had refused her 
security clearance application 
was because she hadn’t re¬ 
vealed her sexual orientation 
on the original application, 
but had later told investiga¬ 
tors that she was a lesbian 
when they asked about the is¬ 
sue. 

Gayer took on Dubbs’ case 
in 1985, basing the case on 
the fact that, among other 
things, the original applica¬ 
tion form didn’t ask any ques¬ 
tions about sexual orientation, 
and that when Dubbs was fi¬ 
nally asked she promptly told 
the truth. 

The CIA has maintained 
throughout the case that it 
does not discriminate based

Sexual Sanctuary Proposal 
On Hold Pending Tribunal 


by Nancy Boutilier 

The plan to make San 
Francisco a sanctuary for 
gays and lesbians suffering 
persecution will have to wait, 
at least until after June 24. 

Supervisors Roberta Acht- 
enberg, Harry Britt and Car¬ 
ole Migden have shifted their 
focus away from previous 
sanctuary proposals in order 
to conduct a community “tri¬ 
bunal” on June 24. 

Supervisor Migden said, 
“We hope to compile testimo¬ 
ny and then we’ll evaluate it 
and determine what action 
would be appropriate.” 

She believes that collecting 
information about the ways 
lesbians and gay men experi¬ 
ence oppression throughout 
the world will lead to “a more 


organic response” than the 
presupposed plans of the past. 

“Given the amount of in¬ 
terest and the diversity of 
opinions,” said Supervisor 
Roberta Achtenberg, “all pro¬ 
posals are off the table.” 

According to John Woods, 
a member of United Colors of 
Queer Nation, a June 10 meet¬ 
ing that included Supervisors 
Britt and Achtenberg as well 
as representatives of Queer 
Nation and the Harvey Milk 
Club’s Black Caucus resulted 
in an agreement to accept the 
language of the original pro¬ 
posal as a working draft, 
which Woods expects to be 
amended following the tri¬ 
bunal. 

“By default the decision 
was made to accept the origi¬ 
nal language of the resolu¬ 


tion,” said Woods. 

He also said that “to the 
extent that queer people of 
color can be protected by this 
proposal, United Colors will 
support the language that 
comes out of the community 
forum.” 

Achtenberg stressed the 
educational value of gathering 
information about persecu¬ 
tion. 

Charging that gay men and 
lesbians are spied on by po¬ 
lice, investigated by the FBI, 
and subject to different immi¬ 
gration policies than straight 
people, Achtenberg said, 
“We’re trying to bring some 
of that to light.” 

The tribunal will take 
place Monday, June 24, in 
Room 1194 of the State Build¬ 
ing at 6 p.m. T

Women's Pom Video 
Stirs Controversy 


by Kate Bornstein 

What is employee abuse 
and who gets to determine 
that? If the perceived wrong 
is not dealt with, is redress in 
a public forum appropriate? 
And why do people tend to 
give negative interpretations 
to other people’s behavior in 
ambiguous situations? These 
are some of the questions sur¬ 
rounding the controversy 
over the release of the new 
women’s porn video, How to 
Have a Sex Party , from 
House O’Chicks Inc. 

The video was made in 
mid-May. ‘The idea of the 
film,” says producer Dorrie 
Lane, “was that women can 
embrace each other sexually 
— safely. The whole idea was 
to give the lesbian communi¬ 
ty a message that it’s good to 
love yourself, enjoy yourself, 
and be safe about it.” 

“It reeked of the heterosex¬ 
ual male pornographer atti¬ 
tude,” counters “Wanda,” one 
of the performers in the 
video. “Here’s the food, here’s 
the drugs, here’s the bait — 
now perform.” 

According to three of the 
eight performers in the video, 
producer Lane abused her po¬ 
sition of power by coercing 
the performers into doing un- 
agreed-upon sex acts on cam¬ 
era. Lane vigorously denies 
this allegation and is support¬ 
ed by another of the perform¬ 
ers, who claims to have ob¬ 
served absolutely no coercion 
on the part of either of the 
producer/directors. 

“It was understood that ev¬ 
eryone was safe,” maintains 
Lane, “that anyone could 
leave whenever they wanted 
to.” 

“Judy,” another performer, 
speaks with the same sort of 
frustration one would hear 
from the victim of any alleged 
date-rape. 

“It was nothing totally con¬ 


crete,” she says, “but it had a 
real feeling of manipulation.” 
She went on to say that she 
had signed a model’s release 
form, and that when the de¬ 
signer drug ecstasy was of¬ 
fered, she did a hit of her 
own free will. 

“Judy” corroborates Lane’s 
claim that the performers 
were initially told they 
would have to do nothing 
they didn’t want to do. How¬ 
ever, she claims that as the 
shoot progressed, Lane began 
pulling various performers 
into acts and positions to 
which they had not agreed. 

After the shoot, a screen¬ 
ing of the video was held for 
all the performers. Lily Brain- 
drop, editor and publisher of 
A Taste of Latex, attended. 

“I went to see the video be¬ 
cause I’d heard that some of 
the women felt violated and 
coerced,” she says. “The wom¬ 
en who felt violated said their 
piece. The producers said 
theirs. My feeling is that the 
lack of care and consideration 
for how the models would be 
feeling stemmed not from any 
maliciousness, but from lack 
of foresight — how to manage 
personnel when you’re shoot¬ 
ing something as sensitive as 
a sex video.” 

When talking with each 
other didn’t resolve the issue, 
three of the women wrote a 
piece in the local ’zine, On 
Our Rag. The piece is angry. 
The women are obviously 
hurt. 

Producer Lane is not un¬ 
touched by the controversy, 
and at this time, the conflict 
remains unsettled. 

“I broke down a day later,” 
she says. “When you get ac¬ 
cused of almost raping some¬ 
one you never touched, and 
blamed for bringing up some¬ 
one’s incest issues you never 
knew they had ... why didn’t 
they just bring the nails and 
put me up on a cross?” ▼ 


4 S.F. Groups Share 
In Foundation Grants 


Four San Francisco groups 
were among the 22 projects 
who received grants from the 
first funding cycle of Out, A 
Fund for Lesbian and Gay 
Liberation, on May 17-18. 

The agencies receiving 
grant allocations were select¬ 
ed by the fund’s board of di¬ 
rectors from more than 100 
groups who applied to the 
fund. 

Out was endowed by a 
$500,000 gift from David Pills- 
bury Becker, a gay activist 
and philanthropist from 
Boston. 

The fund supports under¬ 
funded, grass-roots organizing 
efforts in gay and lesbian 
communities around the 
country, according to Dan 
Geiger, the development di¬ 
rector of the Vanguard Foun¬ 
dation. 

Vanguard is a member of 
the Funding Exchange, a na¬ 
tional network if 15 communi¬ 
ty-based foundations that 
fund social change and orga¬ 
nizing efforts. 

According to Geiger, the 


grants awarded support work 
in the areas of anti-violence, 
community organizing, cul¬ 
ture and media, and lesbian 
rights. 

Gay Asian/Pacific Alliance 
recieved $5,000 for leadership 
development, office space and 
a conference for gay Asians 
and Pacific Islanders. 

Tongues Untied received 
$5,000 for a non-theatrical ed¬ 
ucational film about the gay, 
black experience. 

Lesbian Agenda for Action 
received $3,000 for a member¬ 
ship development program. 

The National Center for 
Lesbian Rights received 
$5,000 for the Expanding Le¬ 
gal Resourses for Lesbians 
of Color Project. 

According to Geiger, Van¬ 
guard Foundation offers assis¬ 
tance with the grant process 
for groups interested in apply¬ 
ing for the grants and can be 
contacted at 285-2005 for 
more information about ap¬ 
plying for next year’s cycle or 
philanthropic assistance 
through its own grant pro¬ 
cess. ▼

Boycott 

(Continued from page 3) 

Many also question 
whether the deal is as good as 
Petrelis makes it sound, even 
if he could get it all in writ¬ 
ing. Indeed, spokespersons for 
Philip Morris make it clear 
that they do not consider the 
corporation committed to any 
specific dollar amount. 

Petrelis argues that ACT 
UP should settle for whatever 
it can get. 

“This is not a widely sup¬ 
ported boycott in the commu¬ 
nity,” he said. “The boycott is 
already effectively over in 
many cities, like Dallas and 
D.C.” 


Although all parties in¬ 
volved deny that this is a per¬ 
sonal feud between activist 
leaders, a power struggle of 
some sort is clearly in 
progress. Many feel that Pe¬ 
trelis tried to rush the deal 
and that he got “taken” by 
Philip Morris in the process. 

The issue of how a decen¬ 
tralized organization like 
ACT UP should deal with na¬ 
tional-level negotiations is far 
from clear. 

The status of the proposed 
settlement is also unclear. 
Some chapters of ACT UP, 
such as Chicago and New 
York, have voted to accept 
the deal and end the boycott, 
but it is possible that they 
will reverse their decisions in 
light of the recent debate. 

Others, like Dallas, are still 


pondering it. Still others, like 
San Francisco, have flatly re¬ 
jected the proposal in its cur¬ 
rent form. 

“There is no consensus to 
end the boycott,” said 
Haskell, referring to the Sun¬ 
day conference call. “There 
was unanimous agreement to 
continue negotiating.” 

The sticking points are the 
lack of a clear dollar amount, 
concern about how much in¬ 
fluence the community advi¬ 
sory group will have on the 
actual distribution of the 
money and the need for 
Philip Morris to apologize for 
its past support of Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) Until these 
concerns are addressed, it is 
likely that at least some ACT 
UP chapters will continue the 
boycott. ▼

Bigotry in 
Guadalajara 


H omophobia has reared its ugly head again, 
this time south of the border. 

The 13th World Conference of the Interna¬ 
tional Lesbian and Gay Association has been 
cancelled thanks to the mayor of Guadalajara, 
Mexico, who promised to arrest delegates for ‘immoral 
behavior.' 

The homophobe also promised to withhold police 
protection for the conference, which had been threatened 
by right-wingers, and forced the host hotel to cancel its 
contract with ILGA. 

This action is appalling and should not be taken 
lightly by gay and lesbian activists in the United States 
and around the world. 

The cancellation comes despite support for the confer¬ 
ence from Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
And this presents a dilemma for activists whose first im¬ 
pulse will be to protest at Mexican Consulates around 
the nation. The consulates represent the Mexican govern¬ 
ment, and not the city of Guadalajara. Unfortunately, this 
is the most logical target at which a demonstration can 
be launched. Hopefully, applying pressure on the Mex¬ 
ican government can prompt the Mexican president to 
censure Guadalajara’s homophobic mayor. 

There are other actions we can take to show our 
disgust at this treatment. For a limited time, refuse to 
take vacations to Mexico, in particular, Guadalajara. 
Avoid flying on Mexicana Airlines. And let them know 
why you are taking these steps. 

Also, let President Bush, who is proposing liberal 
trade agreements with Mexico, know that those agree¬ 
ments are contingent upon the equal treatment of Mex¬ 
ican citizens and foreign visitors with regard to sexual 
orientation. 

The Mexican Consulate in San Francisco is located at 
870 Market St. Their phone number is (415) 392-5554. 
ILGA urges immediate protest letters to: 

— CP Gabriel Covarrubias Ibarra, Presidente Munici¬ 
pal de Guadalajara, Palacio Municipal, Hidalgo y Alcaldo, 
CP 44100 Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. 

— Lie. Nicolas Orosco, President Municipal de Za- 
popan, Palacio Municipal, Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico.

tucional del Estado de Jalisco, Palacio de Gobierno, Plan- 
ta Alta, Corona y Morales, CP 44100 Guadalajara, Jalisco, 
Mexico. Fax: 011 52 36 13 60 97. — Lie. Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari, Presidente Constitucional de los Estados Unidos 
Mexicanos, Palacio Nacional, Mexico D.F., Mexico. 

Letters of support can be sent to Grupo Orgullo Ho¬ 
mosexual de Liberacion y Grupo Lesbico Patlatonalli, 
P.O. Box 1-623, CP 44100 Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.

sult of the conference’s cancellation. Donations are invit¬ 
ed to: Comite Organizador de la XIII Conferencia Anual

Guest Opinion 


Unconditional Love 

The following letter was sent to Assem¬ 
blyman John Vasconcellos, Chairman, 
Ways & Means Committee, California 
State Assembly, Sacramento, CA 95814. 


★ Please vote YES in support of AB101, the 
anti-discrimination bill. 

There simply is no place in California, or for that 
matter in any part of modem society, for discrimina¬ 
tion based on any irrelevant factor, including a per¬ 
son’s sexual orientation and practices. Even more 
clear are the demands made by Jesus Himself to love 
all people. Discrimination has no place if we truly love. 

I suppose the depth of my anger over this issue is 
reflected by my perceived need to state my position 
in boldface type at the beinning of my letter. One 
would have hoped that seeing the letterhead of a 
Christian denomination would have automatically 
flagged this as a letter in support of the bill since our 
Lord’s position on the matter should be so obvious. 
Yet I have heard that the Assembly is being bombard¬ 
ed with anti-ABlOl letters by Lou Sheldon and other 
supposed Christians who have let their personal big¬ 
otry take precedence of our Lord’s demands. 

In fact it is because of these fundamentalist lunatics 
that I have taken the time to let our concerns as Chris¬ 
tians be known. I cannot stand by idle while others 


are lying in the Name of God. While I wouid hope that 
you would listen to the Methodists, Episcopalians, 
Lutherans and other rational Christian churches 
which have supported the bill, I realize that the hate- 
filled cries of fanatics are sometimes as alluring as a 
siren. 

The liturgy of my own consecration came to mind. 
In no uncertain terms I was told that my only real, in¬ 
trinsic, unquestionable command and duty as a 
bishop, leader of the Church, and apostle of Jesus 
Christ was to love everyone unconditionally just as 
Jesus Himself did. The Bible is very clear on the issue. 
Jesus befriended sexual outcasts but bitterly oppos¬ 
ed fundamentalist Pharisees. 

If discrimination against gay people did not exist, 
gays would not take the time, effort and money to sup¬ 
port this bill. If people had no intent to discriminate, 
fundamentalists would not be concerned that their 
bigotry might soon make them criminals. The facts 
are God loves everyone, including gays, and that Lou 
Sheldon and his cronies at the so-called “Traditional 
Values Coalition” have already committed the most 
reprehensible evil possible — spreading hatred in 
Jesus’ Name. 

We pray you will take these thoughts into considera¬ 
tion and openly support and vote for the much-needed 
AB101.

A Mentor and Friend 

★ For your information, the unidentified woman in 
the photo on page 15 (“Gay Rights Support,” June 6) 
is Aileen Hernandez. She was appointed to the Equal 
Employment Commission by President Lyndon 
Johnson, was the second national president of the Na¬ 
tional Organization for Women and our mentor in the 
women’s movement. We need to know more about our 
friends in the San Francisco community.

Busy Letter Writer 

★ Thanks for printing so many useful addresses in 
recent issues. I have recently written to Arsenio Hall, 
Gene Roddenberry, Essence and 18 members of Con¬ 
gress. As this is about the extent of activism I am 
capable of performing at this point, I am grateful for 
the clear information you have been providing. Please 
continue.

Letters 



Billboards Can Only Help 

The following letter was sent to Supervisor 
Willie Kennedy, San Francisco Board of 
Supervisors. 

★ I am horrified and shocked by your public 
statements on the issue of AIDS. 

As you are probably aware, AIDS, like any sexual¬ 
ly transmitted disease (STD), can only be confronted 
and defeated by and with knowledge and awareness. 

Since the segment of our population most involv¬ 
ed with sexual activity is that of our teenagers and 
young adults, we would make ourselves look like 
idiots not to stick the known facts and figures on AIDS 
prevention, which we in San Francisco have spent 
much time and money on developing, right smack in 
their faces. They’re going to engage in sex play 
anyway. We — as responsible adults who care about 
them — would be remiss in withholding AIDS infor¬ 
mation. 

Your position advocating a “motherly,” polite 
avoidance of the truth can only hurt the kids you seek 
to protect. They must understand the truth. 

As the lover of a Person With AIDS and one at risk 
myself, I must ask you and your fellow supervisors to 
truly help our young people avoid AIDS and other 
STDs by responsible behavior based on common 
sense, product of knowledge. 

Billboards in MUNI stations can only help. As a mat¬ 
ter of fact, you and other supervisors ought to be 
thanking and congratulating MUNI for providing 
space for them. 

Really, Ms. Kennedy — do you want more deaths, 
more money paid out, more misery? Your contention, 
that sex-explicit AIDS billboards “border on por¬ 
nography” borders, itself, on pornography. Give 
thanks, not grumps. 

Robert M. Kelliher 
San Francisco 


A Question for Supervisor Kennedy 

The following was sent to Supervisor Willie 
Kennedy. 

★ While reading the article in the Bay Area Reporter 
on June 6, about your and certain religious groups’ op¬ 
position to the Rubberman advertisements for con¬ 
doms, a question for you entered my mind. 

Where was this opposition when Roger Craig of the 
49ers posed in the Macy’s underwear ad in the Chroni¬ 
cle ? That was just to sell briefs, NOT SAVE LIVES 
and you people certainly did not raise a flap over that 
photo even though it was and still is plastered all over 
San Francisco and the Bay Area. Why? 

I have not heard of anything constructive (that sticks 
in my mind anyway) that you, Supervisor Kennedy, 
have accomplished as a member of the Board of 
Supervisors. If this is the best cause that you can come 
up with, madam, I suggest that you resign your posi¬ 
tion from the board and look the other way every time 
you see a Rubberman ad. AIDS is a very serious issue, 
and if it takes showing a little skin to make someone 
stop and think twice about safe sex, then what harm 
is it to you and your group? 

Tom Begano 
San Francisco, CA 


Bigotry, Homophobia 

The following letter was sent to Supervisor 
Willie Kennedy, San Francisco Board of 
Supervisors. 

★ How dare you attempt to interrupt the dissemina¬ 
tion of vital health information to our community with 
your bigoted, homophobic comments regarding the 
content of the Rubberman posters? 

In case you are unaware or have not picked up a 
newspaper or listened to the radio or television news 
broadcasts lately, we are in the second decade of a 
serious epidemic that has already killed thousands of 
individuals and which threatens the lives of millions 
more. 

Ten years after we first found out about how AIDS 
is transmitted, people (gay and straight) are still be¬ 
ing infected by unprotected sex. It is crucial that we 
appeal to people in the most honest and frank man¬ 
ner possible that they must use condoms to protect 
themselves and others. 

It is true that the Rubberman posters display allur¬ 
ing figures to draw the viewers’ attention, but at the 
same time the viewer is receiving the message of con¬ 
dom use which is more important than anything that 
would offend you and your prissy, moralizing funda¬ 
mentalist friends. If the figures of men in suggestive 
poses caught your attention and you read the accom¬ 
panying condom use message, the advertisements 


worked. These ads are effective. 

I wonder how big a problem you would have had 
if the ads were specifically directed toward 
HETEROsexuals? By the way, where were you and 
your fundamentalist friends when the almost com¬ 
pletely nude body of straight San Francisco 49er 
Roger Craig was plastered all over every newsstand 
in the city? And how about all those cigarette and li¬ 
quor advertisements in every media which routinely 
use sex to sell addiction and death? 

The Rubberman posters are life-affirming and use 
sex to promote responsible attitudes while you and 
your fundamentalist friends would like the residents 
of this city and the world to go on being ignorant of 
the clear and present danger of AIDS. 

I support the Rubberman campaign, the AIDS 
Foundation’s decision to sponsor it and the Public 
Utilities Commission’s decision to place the ads in 
MUNI venues. I accuse you of ignorance, counter¬ 
productivity and homophobia. You, Supervisor Ken¬ 
nedy, are part of the problem.

★ Harry Britt is right. Supervisor Willie Kennedy’s 
request to have the SF AIDS Foundation Rubberman 
condom billboards removed from MUNI stations is 
ridiculous. 

When the seductive C&R Clothier commercials 
(which surely reach more people), the cigarette adver¬ 
tisement billboards (which surely do more harm) and 
the countless sexist billboards, commercials, 
magazine and newspaper ads in which bikini-clad 
women stare at the viewer are all censored, then Ken¬ 
nedy may complain about the Rubberman posters 
(which, of all these things, is meant only to help re¬ 
mind people to practice safer sex). What about Roger 
Craig for Macy’s? Is his flesh any more legitimate 
because he’s selling skivvies instead of safety? 
Sheessh! 

To target the AIDS Foundation billboards and label 
them “bordering on pornography” reveals the 
homophobia and bigotry in Kennedy’s “religious” 
community. Ten years of AIDS and 110,000 deaths. 
Supervisor Kennedy — FOCUS!

Fear of Association 

The following letter was sent to Advertising 
Age magazine. 

★ Sid Bernstein in his May 27 column, “Who Wins 
in New AIDS Fight,” states that he does not support 
“Ads Against AIDS” “because of its implication that 
AIDS is a major problem in the ad business.” He fur¬ 
ther states that “despite its gradual spread, AIDS is 
still mostly concentrated among the homosexual 
population and certain entertainment and artistic 
circles (!) in contrast to the general population, so this 
promotion can easily be seen as another indication 
that advertising has become a unit of the entertain¬ 
ment industry — an indication that I don’t approve 
(sic).” 

To paraphrase comedian Richard Lewis, where 
should I begin? First of all, just because a group of ad 
people get together to combat a social problem, it does 
not suggest that this problem is endemic in the ad in¬ 
dustry. Advertising groups have produced pro bono 
campaigns in the past for causes like gun control, and 
no one infers that firearms are rampant throughout 
agencies. But the sad reality is that AIDS has touch¬ 
ed the advertising industry, as it has virtually every 
field. Over 100,000 people in the country have already 
died of the disease, including many of our co-workers. 
How many people have to die before Mr. Bernstein 
considers this a major problem in the ad business? 

Mr. Bernstein then argues that AIDS is still heavi¬ 
ly concentrated among “the homosexual population 
and certain entertainment and artistic circles in con¬ 
trast to the general population.” I know that sexual 
contact can spread the AIDS virus, but never 
suspected involvement in the arts could also be 
responsible. Perhaps the headline of a Bernstein- 
inspired AIDS prevention campaign would be “Pro¬ 
duce a Play — Use a Condom.” 

But seriously, the misconception that AIDS is con¬ 
fined to certain high-risk groups is outmoded and 
dangerous. In fact, the minority of new AIDS cases 
are not among gays or artists but heterosexual 
teenagers. Already over 100,000 teens are believed to 
be infected with the AIDS virus. Teens and others in 
the “general population” stand to benefit the most 
from an ad campaign convincing them that they too 
are at risk. 

As for Mr. Bernstein’s fear that “Ads Against AIDS” 
will associate advertising with the entertainment in¬ 
dustry, this fear hardly justifies withholding support 
from “Ads Against AIDS” In the fight against an in¬ 
curable, contagious disease, the spread of which can 
only be contained by convincing the public to change 
specific behaviors, advertising is one of the few 
weapons we have.

Useful Criticism 

★ I would like to express some disappointment in this 
year’s Bike-A-Thon. After participating in both this 
and last year’s event, I would like to offer some useful 
criticism. 

My biggest disappointment was the starting loca¬ 
tion. I remember last year starting at Collingwood 
Park and riding through the Castro while people who 
were too weak to cheer us on from the starting line 
waved us on from their windows. It left me with a good 
feeling when I saw this guy waving as best he could 
and yelling an appreciative thank you. I really felt I 
was doing something good. 

I also felt it wasn’t promoted the way it should have 
been. Look at the ads placed for the Bay-to-Breakers 
race every year. Why aren’t similar ads and broader 
coverage deemed as important as they are for that 
race? Maybe an ad on television would help out. 

The 100K was a beautiful and challenging ride but 
at one point I and 25 others were at an intersection 
trying to figure out which way to go. This happened 
three other times because of the lack of visible signs 
and arrows. Maybe next year day-glo signs that would 
be easier to see could be used. The signs used this year 
were so similar to other street signs they were difficult 
to see. 

Finally, I feel a set of starting times should be 
established, perhaps a half-hour between each. That 
way there would be more of a sense of community and 
those arriving alone could find others to ride with. I 
was disappointed when I was told that there was no 
ceremonial kick-off and to begin whenever I wanted. 

Overall, I would like to commend the organizers of 
the Bike-A-Thon, the volunteers and all of the riders 
who gave their time to make this such a rewarding and 
successful event. See you next year.

Pulling Our Leg 

★ In the last issue of May of the Sentinel, there ap¬ 
peared an article extolling the journalistic and 
publishing accomplishments of Ray Chalker. 

According to the article, Chalker is the current reci¬ 
pient of the most prestigious award for achievement 
in the magazine industry’s 250-year history. The arti¬ 
cle states that he was unanimously chosen by 
thousands of his colleagues from around the world 
and that the award was presented to him at a lavish 
and hugely attended fete in Natick, Mass. However, 
no mention was made of the organization’s name nor 
the date of the event. The article implied that this was 
recent. 

Curiosity getting the better of me, I telephoned the 
Sentinel to get further details. The first person I spoke 
with quietly chuckled and passed me along to another 
writer there, who seemed to find the whole thing tell¬ 
ingly amusing, also. He chuckled, too. Both writers 
suggested I speak with Ray himself. Ray wasn’t there. 

I then telephoned and spoke with a reporter who 
works for the Middlesex News — Natick’s only 
newspaper. 

He laughed as I read him the Sentinel article. He 
then told me, “There isn’t much going on in Natick. 
There is only one half-decent hotel where such an 
event could have taken place and as the sole jour¬ 
nalistic professional in the area, it would not have 
escaped my attention.” He stated that he was certain 
the event had never occurred and that he had never 
heard of Ray Chalker. 

He chuckled on and said, “Someone out there is try¬ 
ing to pull your leg.”

AIDS Hysteria Surge 

★ I have been following the story of the Virginia man 
whose transplanted organs allegedly caused AIDS in 
several recipients. For years, immunosuppressive 
agents have been used to control the rejection reac¬ 
tion after an organ transplant. 

Since these drugs for the most part suppress all im¬ 
munologic function, overwhelming opportunistic in¬ 
fections due to immune failure have always been the 
leading cause of death in transplant patients. Until 
now, no one called it AIDS. The mere presence of HIV 
changed all that, and a common medical event 
magically had been transformed into AIDS headlines 
for everybody. Mandatory testing gets closer with each 
surge of hysteria. 

Walter Bryan 
San Francisco 


Cross-Gendered Ignorance 

★ As a transsexual, I am dismayed to see disinforma¬ 
tion being spread by the B.A.R. Considering the fact 
that a transsexual writer is a regular contributor to 
your paper, I was a little surprised to see you refer to 
a male-to-female TS as a male. The story (June 6) con¬ 
cerned a transsexual and her mother who were strip 
searched at a homeless shelter. 

By using masculine pronouns and calling this per¬ 
son a “son” rather than “former son,” you are per¬ 
petuating public ignorance about cross-gendered 
people. Thus it is no surprise when a letter to the 
B.A.R. in the same issue refers to Bambi Lake as 
“him/her” and “he/she.” Is the writer of that letter be¬ 
ing smirky and sarcastic, or is he truly not sure what 
to call her? If there were more responsible journalism 
with regard to cross-gendered people, then it would 
be more clear as to what is prejudice as opposed to 
ignorance. 

Cross-gendered people are in the same situation that 
homosexuals were in before Stonewall. The gay com¬ 
munity is in a position to either hurt or help us and 
I’d still like to think that those who know of what it 
was like for gays before the ’70s would be empathetic 
toward another societally-oppressed group. Natural¬ 
ly, it is up to us in the cross-gender community to stand 
up and be counted, to “come out of the closet” and de¬ 
mand our own rights. And one of those rights we der- 
mand is to be treated with respect, including what we 
are called.

Praiseworthy Porn 

★ To the extent you (porn reviewer Marc Huestis) do, 
thanks for trying. One day I hope to pick up one of 
your columns wherein you enjoyed the movies — 
maybe for a novelty you could take a break from 
whatever your editor forces you to review and review 
for us something you find palatable. Or even 
praiseworthy! Or just enjoyable. 

Although I cringe at Jeffie Stryker for about the 
same reasons you mention, don’tcha think you might 
have come down a little hard on the boy this time? Or 
did you forget scenes like his gorgeous round buns 
bumping up and down on that guard in his prison 
film? (Was there only one?) Indeed, before he loses it 
completey to the inevitable ravages of time, it would 
be great to see him loving someone else inside those 
same buns or truly gorging himself appreciatively on 
someone else’s steaming dick. Mouth-wise. 

While you were mentioning the FBI in Busted, you 
could have given some credit to the charmingButchie 
Taylor, or hoped the other guy would melt and “share” 
a lot more in the sequel. 

If you really believe the primary freedom the film¬ 
makers want is their freedom to make more bucks at 
any price, are you conceding there is no redeeming 
social value to their “artistic” attempts? If so, how long 
must we wait to read a porno column where the writer 
really gets off on his subject? Any time would be nice.

Sickening Article 

★ I recently found the following article in the na¬ 
tionally distributed Video Business magazine: 

Following ‘Instinct’ 

Gay groups have been giving Carolco Pictures a 
hard time about its film Basic Instinct, starring 
Michael Douglas. The movie is about a romance be¬ 
tween a druggie cop and a female bisexual psy¬ 
chopath. 

The filming in San Francisco has been disrupted 
by activist groups who call the film “lesbophobic” 
because it stigmatizes bisexual and lesbian women as 
wanting to kill men. 

According to the New York Daily News, the groups 
threatened to kill the (male) publisher of a local 
newspaper because he supported the film. Hmm. 

Needless to say, this article sickens me. Like it or 
not, others are watching us and ridiculing us. Any 
comments on this article can be sent to Theresa 
O’Neill, Assistant Editor, Video Business Magazine, 
825 Seventh Ave., New York, NY 10019; (212) 887-8400.

San Mateo Board of Supervisors President Tom Nolan in SLUG'S jail at the San Jose Gay Pride 
Festival June 9. _ (Photo; Rjck Qerharter) 


Nolan Has Chance for Congress 


T he open 12th Congres¬ 
sional District race on 
the Peninsula being 
vacated by Rep. Tom 
Campbell, a Republican now 
running for his party’s U.S. 
Senate nomination, is attract¬ 
ing a number of candidates in 
both the Democratic and Re¬ 
publican parties. San Mateo 
County Supervisor Tom No¬ 
lan, a respected gay officehold¬ 
er, is thought to have the lead 
among Democrats to succeed 
Campbell. 

Nolan is serving his 12th 
year on the board, and many 
think he will win the nomina¬ 
tion for the open seat that in¬ 
cludes both San Mateo and 
Santa Clara counties. 

Though Democrats out¬ 
number Republicans slighty, 
44 percent to 42 percent, in 
registration, the 12th District 
seat has been represented by 
Republicans in Washington for 
nearly the past three decades, 
and even the Republicans are 
saying that if the Democratic 
Party is to win the seat, it 
would take a candidate with 
Nolan’s popularity to do it. 

Other probable Democrats 
in the contest for the nomina¬ 
tion in next June’s primary 
include San Mateo Supervis¬ 
or Anna Eshoo, who lost to 
Campbell in 1988, and Assem¬ 
blyman Byron Sher. 

On the Republican side, As¬ 
semblyman Charles Quacken- 
bush and San Mateo Super¬ 
visor Tom Huening have al¬ 
ready entered the race, with 
other Republicans expected. 

This 12th District race 
makes it possible that Nolan 
could well become the first 
openly gay member of Con¬ 
gress from the western United 
States and the contest will be 
closely watched nationwide. 

Supervisors Harry Britt, 
Carole Migden and Roberta 
Achtenberg, along with other 
San Francisco friends of Nolan 
will hold a cocktail reception/ 
fundraiser for him at the Con¬ 
temporary Realist Gallery, 23 
Grant Ave., June 18 from 5:30- 
7:30 pm. A $50 donation is re¬ 
quested. Call 368-1663. 

★ ★ ★ 

Former Gov. Jerry Brown is 
sounding as though he is al¬ 
ready the Democratic Party 
nominee for retiring Alan 
Cranston’s U.S. Senate seat. 

Brown, who has spent mil¬ 
lions himself in past political 


campaigns, told the San Jose 
Mercury News that he would 
make an issue out of Rep. Tom 
Campbell’s fundraising abil¬ 
ities. 

Campbell, of course, just 
could be the GOP nominee 
next year against Brown, who 
is trying to pass himself as 
some kind of populist and 
thinks that Campbell’s raising 
$500,000 recently at a Silicon 
Valley fundraiser is somehow 
immoral. 

According to Brown, “He 
(Campbell) is the captive of the 
top 1 percent of the people 
who, with his moral and polit¬ 
ical support, increased their in¬ 
comes by more than 100 per¬ 
cent in the past decade, while 
the vast majority of the people 
were seeing their share of the 
American dream decline.” 

Well, it is conventional wis¬ 
dom, even among state Demo¬ 
crats, that Jerry could well win 
the nomination for the Senate 
next year, but even his own 
party bigwigs doubt that he 
can win the general election. 

Name identification in a 
field crowded with others like 
McCarthy, Boxer, Levine, etc., 
give Brown a definite advan¬ 
tage. But if he runs his Senate 
campaign the way he ran the 
party during the last statewide 
campaign, the Republicans 
will pick up Alan Cranston’s 
seat next year. 

★ ★ ★ 

Supervisor Harry Britt, the 
Alice B. Toklas and Stonewall 
Gay Democratic Clubs and the 
Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Voters 
Project are holding a gay and 
lesbian fundraiser for the 
Hongisto for Mayor campaign 
June 21 at the Galleon Bar & 
Restaurant. A $35 donation is 
asked. 

Los Angeles County super¬ 
visors last week approved a 
$492 monthly stipend for 
themselves. They already 
make $99,000 a year, are pro¬ 
vided chauffered cars, large of¬ 
fice staffs and $15,000 a year to 
buy health, dental and disabil¬ 
ity insurance as well as retire¬ 
ment pay of up to 100 percent 
of their salaries. Is Doris Ward 
and the City Hall Gang 
reading this? 

Former U.S. Surgeon Gen¬ 
eral G Everett Koop, a pioneer 
in the fight against the AIDS 
epidemic, now has his own 
five-part, prime-time NBC 
series about the state of health 


care in America. 

Koop, who fought with the 
Reagan administration regard¬ 
ing its AIDS policy (or lack of 
same), says we are not faring 
much better under George 
Bush. Nearly two years after 
resigning his office, after Bush 
became president, Koop says, 
“There’s nothing happening 
with health care in the admin¬ 
istration. Our biggest health 
care problem is that we have 
no health system. I knew I 
would not be able to accom¬ 
plish anything in this adminis¬ 
tration, so I got out,” Koop said 
last week. 

Mayor Art Agnos last week 
appointed longtime Latino ac¬ 
tivist Raquel Medina to a seat 
on the city’s Human Rights 
Commission, replacing 
recently-fired Adrian Ber¬ 
mudez. 

Friday, as state budget nego¬ 
tiators in Sacramento were 
cooling their heels waiting for 
Speaker Willie Brown to show 
in Gov. Pete Wilson’s office for 
a 9 a.m. meeting, those wait¬ 
ing, both Democrats and Re¬ 
publicans, grew more and 
more annoyed when the speak¬ 
er finally arrived — at about 
6 p.m. 

Brown reportedly claimed 
that he was stuck in traffic on 
his way to Sacramento from 
San Francisco. What a hell of 
a traffic jam that would have 
been. 

Wilson’s staffers were told, 
however, that Willie had man¬ 
aged to keep a standing Friday 
luncheon appointment with 
Chronicle columnist Herb 
Caen, a report that really man¬ 
aged to infuriate those waiting 
to work on the overdue budget. 

Rep. Charles E. Bennett, an 
80-year-old congressman from 
Florida, last week celebrated 
his 40th year in Congress. He 
holds some kind of record for 
never having missed a vote in 
his four decades. I wonder if 
former Congressman, now As¬ 
semblyman John Burton, ever 
met this guy. 

State Supreme Court Justice 
Allen E. Broussard, the last re¬ 
maining appointee of Demo¬ 
cratic former Gov. Jerry 
Brown, and the high court’s 
only black member, will resign 
in August, and Pete Wilson is 
being urged to appoint another 
black man or woman to the 
vacancy.

Biting the Big Apple 



by Rachel Pepper 

I love New York. I really 
do. From the moment 
my plane landed May 28 
till the time I flew back 
to San Francisco last week, I 
was completely in my ele¬ 
ment. Maybe it’s because I 
grew up there, and therefore 
the city will forever be in my 
blood. Or maybe it’s because 
New Yorkers are street 
smart, pushy, arrogant, fast- 
talking, and always think they 
know better than anyone else. 
As you can imagine, this girl 
fits right in. 

And if the average New 
Yorker is all the things men¬ 
tioned above, then queer 
residents are also hipper, 
smarter and more cutting 
edge than their counterparts 
anywhere else, including even 
most San Franciscans. So 
how could I fail to have any¬ 
thing but a fabulous time 
there on my week-long apres 
SPEW jaunt? 

When I first arrived in 
New York, I was cocky. Al¬ 
though I hadn’t been back for 
years, and it was my first trip 
back queer, I initially refused 
the offer of a map from a 
well-meaning friend. After all, 
surely I could navigate myself 
around as well as any other 
native, regardless of my years 
of absence. So I set off the 
first day from Eliza’s South 
Harlem apartment toward the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
Of course, I promptly got lost. 

Still, after a little side trip 
around Manhattan, I did man¬ 
age to get to the Met. Now, 
usually I am a cynic about 
ftiuseums, because too many 
paintings of women by dead 
straight white men tend to 
make me crabby. But my usu¬ 
al skepticism was put on hold 
quickly as I wandered from 
one room to another full of 
magnificent masterpieces by 
the likes of Renoir, Degas, 
Monet and Cezanne, com¬ 
pletely in awe. 

Soon, I was dizzy from di¬ 
gesting art, so after seeking 
out and paying homage to Pi¬ 
casso’s portrait of Gertrude 
Stein as well as Georgia 
O’Keefe’s Black Iris, I wan¬ 
dered back outside. On the 
steps of the museum, I ate a 
pretzel like all the other 
tourists, and marvelled at 
how relaxed I felt being back 
in the Big Apple. 

I was in such a good mood, 
sitting there in the sunshine, 
that I even agreed to pose 
with some male Korean 
tourists who wanted me in 
their pic. As their buddy 
snapped the photo, they put 
their arms around me simul¬ 
taneously, and I flashed them 


my all-time cutest American 
dyke grin. After all, I knew 
my labrys necklace was shin¬ 
ing brightly in the sun, and 
that someday, somebody back 
home would recognize that in 
the photo and smile. 

There were many moments 
like this one for me during 
my stay in New York. Mo¬ 
ments full of good humor and 
small ironies that make me 
feel queer without having to 
shout about it, as I often feel 
compelled to do in San Fran¬ 
cisco. Moments like seeing all 
the ‘Absolutely Queer” 
posters up all around the Vil¬ 
lage and realizing that it took 
a New York gay man with guts 
to finally plaster the word 
“dyke” under Jodie Foster’s 
face. Or going to a Dyke Ac¬ 
tion Machine meeting and re¬ 
alizing, with a sigh, that ac¬ 
tivist dyke politics are no dif¬ 
ferent in New York than they 
are in San Francisco. 

There were also the pleas¬ 
ant forays into another major 
mecca’s queer culture: buying 
OutWeek the day it comes 
out on a New York City 
newsstand, seeing Paris Is 
Burning before it even opens 
in San Francisco, and the 


thrill of finally visiting the 
Pop Shop, a living shrine to 
art activist Keith Haring. 

There was the much-antic¬ 
ipated visit to the site of the 
Stonewall riots as well as re¬ 
visiting the Central Park Chil¬ 
dren’s Zoo, scene of many 
happy childhood moments. 
There was getting to meet au¬ 
thor and ultra-deluxe dyke 
Jewelle Gomez and attending 
an incredible poetry reading 
by African-American lesbians 
like Malkia Cyril and Nicole 
Breedlove, both under 20 and 
definitely the voice of a fierce 
new queer generation. 

There was the fun of meet¬ 
ing lots of women I’d never 
seen before and being happily 
surprised that many knew me 
already through my freelance 
writing and my ’zines. There 
was the pleasure of seeing the 
strength of “queer row” at the 
American Bookseller’s Con¬ 
vention and realizing that gay 
and lesbian literature is truly

Health Bill May 
Be in Trouble 


by Marghe Covino 

SACRAMENTO - Assem¬ 
bly Bill 373, which created 
the mechanism that will pay 
up to $1 million in health care 
for catastrophic illnesses, may 
be in place by Jan. 1992 if 
AB1789, which will appropri¬ 
ate $100,000 in start-up costs, 
passes in the Senate. 

However, according to the 
author of both bills, Assem- 
blymember Dave Elder (D- 
Long Beach), AB1789 passed 
in the Assembly by only 42 to 
29 and is facing an uphill bat¬ 
tle in the Senate. 

AB1789 is a follow-up to 
AB373, signed into law last 
year, which created volun¬ 
tary, low-cost catastrophic 
health care for everyone in 
California. It pays $1 million 
in lifetime health-care bene¬ 
fits. 

The bill provides that the 
insurance activates after 
$50,000 of other coverage or 
personal assets have been 
spent. This insurance was not 
meant to stand by itself but 
was designed to dovetail with 
other insurances like MR 
MIP, which provide low-cost 
coverage up to $50,000. 

According to Elder, the 
$100,000 start-up costs re¬ 
quired in AB1789 will be tak¬ 
en from the Insurance Fund 
and, in accordance with an 


amendment worked out in 
Assembly Ways and Means, 
will be paid back as a loan to 
the Department of Health 
Services. The money, if ap¬ 
propriated, will be paid back 
by June 30, 1992. 

“This is a private-sector op¬ 
eration. There is no govern¬ 
ment expense and no cost to 
the state except for the loan 
of start-up fees,” Elder said. 
“It’s already operating in 
Montgomery County in Mary¬ 
land, in Washington, D.C., 
and in Baltimore. There are 
more than 120,000 members 
in the system. It’s proven to 
work. It just provides inex¬ 
pensive catastrophic care. 

“The insurance will cost 
about $100 a year per family 
or $30 a year for individuals. 
It will protect people from 
having to sell their homes, 
cars and other assets to pay 
medical bills with each per¬ 
son covered up to $1 million. 
Eventually we hope to cover 
our own state employees with 
the plan.” 

Elder said the Department 
of Health Services and the 
Department of Insurance 
were at first opposed to the 
concept but both have be¬ 
come enthusiastic supporters 
and both are vying to admin¬ 
ister the insurance program 
which will go out for bids to 
private insurance companies. 


Bill Aims to Quell 
Clinic Demo Violence 


by Marghe Covino 

SACRAMENTO - As¬ 
sembly member Barbara Lee 
(D-Oakland) has introduced 
AB1097, a bill that makes it 
illegal to intentionally ob¬ 
struct a person from entering 
a clinic, church or school. 

The bill may have an ef¬ 
fect on the way activists in 
the gay and lesbian communi¬ 
ty conduct protests. 

However, the bill will also 
have a significant impact for 
the women and men who act 
as escorts at area health clin¬ 
ics. Some women’s rights ac¬ 
tivists claim there have been 
increasingly violent confronta¬ 
tions initiated by fundamen¬ 
talist protesters at clinics. 

According to provisions of 
the bill, “it shall be a criminal 
misdemeanor for any person 
to physically detain, hinder or 
prevent another person from 
entering a health care facility, 
church or school.” 

A first offense could re¬ 
quire up to five days in the 
county jail and a maximum 
fine of $250 or both. A second 
offense requires a mandatory 
five-day sentence and a max¬ 
imum fine of $500 or both, 
and the third and all subse¬ 
quent offenses call for a 
mandatory 30-day sentence 


and/or a $2,000 fine. 

The bill allows for commu¬ 
nity service in lieu of the fine 
imposed if it is proven that 
the fine will cause an econom¬ 
ic hardship to the defendant 
or his/her family. 

Lee, whose district in¬ 
cludes Oakland, Alameda and 
Emeryville, replaced former 
Assemblyperson Elihu Har¬ 
ris, who retired to become the 
mayor of Oakland. 

Lee earned her bachelor of 
arts at Mills College and her 
master of social work at UC- 
Berkeley. Lee is no stranger 
to the legislative process; she 
was a senior staff member for 
U.S. Rep. Ron Dellums from 
1975 to 1987. 

According to Lee’s chief of 
staff, Sandra Simpson 
Fontaine, “Research indicated 
that there were laws regard¬ 
ing trespassing which cover 
businesses but none for non¬ 
profit entities. There were in¬ 
cidents at health clinics in the 
district, and she felt it was im¬ 
portant to address the prob¬ 
lems raised by those inci¬ 
dents.” 

AB1097 passed out of the 
Assembly by a 51-20 vote. It 
will now go to the Senate, 
move through committees 
there, and be put to a vote on 
the Senate floor. ▼

Queer Nation Protests 
Burbank School Witch-Hunt 


by Karen Ocamb 

LOS ANGELES - About 
40 members of Queer Nation 
went back to junior high 
school June 11 to protest the 
treatment of two openly gay 
eighth-grade teachers by 
school administrators at a 
public school in Burbank. 

At 7 a.m. the protesters 
greeted the arriving students 
and parents with signs and 
fliers urging support for the 
teachers who were wearing 


“Queer Teacher” T-shirts. 

Chuck Stewart and Dale 
Landefeld, the popular un¬ 
tenured teachers, claim that 
they were forced to resign 
from the John Muir Middle 
School in Burbank because of 
negative evaluations written 
by Ron Lipari, a school vice 
principal. They further claim 
that Lipari has a “hidden 
agenda.” 

In private conversations 
with Stewart, Lipari allegedly 
said that he was a fundamen¬ 


talist, that “humans and chil¬ 
dren are evil and basically 
bad and must be controlled” 
and that “we need to stop 
people like you.” 

A school receptionist said 
Lipari was tied up with a 
30th anniversary of rock ’n’ 
roll show and was unable to 
return phone calls by press 
time. 

Because another popular 
male teacher, single and in 
his forties, was also pressured

Lesbian L.A. Police Officer 
Comes Out of the Closet 


by Sandy Dwyer 

LOS ANGELES — For the 
first time in the history of the 
Los Angeles Police Depart¬ 
ment, an active duty officer 
has “come out of the closet.” 

Officer Sue Herold, 28, 
made the announcement in 
an exclusive interview with 
Vanguard on June 5. 

In November 1989, Herold 
was one of two LAPD offi¬ 
cers still on the force who, us¬ 
ing pseudonyms, joined in the 
discrimination lawsuit 
brought against the LAPD by 
gay ex-officer Mitch Grobeson 
in 1988. 

Grobeson alleges discrimi¬ 
nation based on sexual orien¬ 
tation and in the suit detailed 
instances where in life-threat- 
eningsituations, other officers 
failed to come to his aid. 

At that time, Herold and 
the other officer thought that 
if they went public, they too 
would be subjected to further 
harassment by the LAPD. 

In fact, the threat was so 
real that a preliminary injunc¬ 
tion was sought by their attor¬ 
neys to prevent the LAPD 
“and its agents and employ¬ 
ees, from invading the priva¬ 
cy of third-party witnesses 
and from retaliating against 
any past or present employee 
of the department who comes 
forward, at great personal 
risk, to give testimony in this 
action.” 

Now, a year-and-a-half lat¬ 


er, Herold felt it was time for 
her to be open. She has in 
that period of time endured a 
great deal of harassment, for 
while the television cameras 
showed only the back of her 
head when she agreed to be 
interviewed by the media at a 
news conference announcing 
her joining the Grobeson suit, 
she was recognized by offi¬ 
cers at her station. 

In addition, she said she 
followed department proce¬ 
dures that require officers to 
inform their commanding of¬ 
ficer prior to giving inter¬ 
views to the media. 

Herold informed her com¬ 
manding officer that she 
would be giving an interview 
in which she would admit be¬ 
ing a lesbian. 

She said the harassment 
was particularly difficult for 
the immediate three months 
following the news confer¬ 
ence. But she said, it has ups 
and downs. For the most 
part, her harassment, she 
said, is somewhat different 
from Grobeson’s, more subtle, 
although she alleges she too 
has been exposed to life- 
threatening situations as a re¬ 
sult of discrimination. 

One career threatening, 
but not life threatening, ex¬ 
ample is the mysterious “lost” 
requests for a shift change; 
lost requests for special unit 
assignments; and orders re¬ 
scinding time off that never 
reached her in time for her to 


comply. 

The shift change request 
was especially significant be¬ 
cause traveling over an hour 
to work during rush hour 
traffic caused her to have a 
“lateness problem” that result¬ 
ed in a two-day suspension 
without pay. 

“They were waiting for me 
to sink myself with their 
help,” she said. 

But she made waves and 
got the shift change and is on 
the alert for any other possi¬ 
ble harassment. 

“I can’t even tell you who 
‘they’ are,” Herold said. “The 
powers that be ... probably 
comes from way up ... the 
top.” 

She plans to stay on the 
force and hopes that her pres¬ 
ence as an open lesbian will 
make it easier for others to 
also come out. Right now, she 
said that she knows of many 
gay and lesbian officers, but 
“they won’t talk with me, 
they turn their back to me.” 

She speculates that they 
are afraid to talk to her be¬ 
cause of “guilt by association.” 

“In the past, if you made it 
known you were gay or les¬ 
bian,” she said, “it stopped 
your career in its tracks.” 

Herold is unsure how her 
openness will actually affect 
her career and chances for ad¬ 
vancement. 

“I want to be promoted,” 
said Herold, who is two steps 
from sergeant. Y 



'Instinct' Protest Shifts to L.A., 
Queer Nation Pickets Carolco 


by Karen Ocamb 

LOS ANGELES — About 
10 Queer Nationals, including 
four activists from San Fran¬ 
cisco, picketed Carolco head¬ 
quarters in West Hollywood 
June 7, protesting the compa¬ 
ny’s making of the film Basic 
Instinct. 

The film, activists say, ma¬ 
liciously portrays a lesbian 
and two bisexual women as 
murderers. 

The protesters waved 
signs and screamed at passing 
cars on the famed Sunset 
Strip, but few people showed 
support. One man stopped his 


car, identified himself as gay, 
and said that he found the 
word queer “offensive — 
you’re losing your point.” 

A few pedestrians stopped 
and asked questions, but most 
walked past the Queer Na¬ 
tionals. 

Carolco and the media-con¬ 
scious Hollywood community 
may have been expecting 
more than 10 demonstrators 
in the wake of the headline¬ 
grabbing protests during the 
film’s recent shooting in San 
Francisco. 

The June 7 action garnered 
a page 3 story in Daily Vari¬ 
ety and a story also appeared 


in the Hollywood Reporter. 

The advanced stories antic¬ 
ipated between 20 to 30 
demonstrators and spelled out 
Queer Nation’s planned day 
of protest. 

Daily Variety indicated 
that “the group’s goals have 
changed” since the San Fran¬ 
cisco demonstrations and that 
“it is now asking for Carolco 
to include a public service an¬ 
nouncement with the film.” 

Queer National Scott 
Robbe is quoted as saying, 
“At this point we’re asking 
the cooperation of Carolco in 
educating the public about

D.C. Diocese Defies Church, 
Ordains Lesbian as Priest 


United Press International 

WASHINGTON - The 
Episcopal Diocese of Wash¬ 
ington has ordained into the 
priesthood a woman living in 
an open lesbian relationship, 
defying the national Episco¬ 
pal Church’s opposition to ho¬ 
mosexual clergy. 

Elizabeth Carl, 44, was or¬ 
dained June 5 in a traditional 
ceremony at the Church of 
the Epiphany. 

While the Episcopal 
Church does not forbid the 
ordination of homosexuals, it 
passed a resolution in 1979 
saying it is “not appropriate 
to ordain practicing homosex¬ 
uals or those engaging in sex¬ 
ual relations outside mar¬ 
riage,” said Jeffrey Penn, a 
spokesman at the church’s 
U.S. headquarters in New 
York. 

He said such a resolution 
did not carry the same moral 
authority as church canon, 
but should be used by practic¬ 


ing Episcopalians to deter¬ 
mine how they should act. 

But the bishop of Washing¬ 
ton, Ronald Haines, said 
Carl’s ordination was an at¬ 
tempt to acknowledge that 
clergy were sometimes homo- 



“Now, we 
would rather 
be truthful 
from the 
beginning/' 



sexual, even if the church 
heirarchy did not acknowl¬ 
edge it. 

“Before, there was a tacit 
approach. There was an un¬ 
derstanding that a (priest) was 


gay but it just wasn’t said ... 
and no one asked,” he said be¬ 
fore the ordination ceremony. 
“Now, we would rather be 
truthful from the beginning.” 

He said he was determined 
to ordain Carl to eliminate 
“an overlay of deception that 
was painful and causing prob¬ 
lems.” 

Earlier in a statement, 
Haines said Carl “has for a 
number of years lived in a 
loving and intimate relation¬ 
ship with smother woman.” 

Carl, a native of Houston, 
was raised a Methodist. She 
received a graduate degree in 
library science from the 
Catholic University of Amer¬ 
ica and has worked at the Li¬ 
brary of Congress for 16 
years. 

She graduated from the 
Union Theological Seminary 
in New York in 1990. Before 
her ordination, she was assis¬ 
tant minister at Church of the 
Epiphany. T

Presbyterians 

Reject 

Gay-Positive 

Stand 

United Press International 

BALTIMORE - The Pres¬ 
byterian Church (USA) by a 
large majority has adopted a 
report on human sexuality 
that reversed liberal conclu¬ 
sions in an earlier paper. 

The original report said 
sexual expression could have 
integrity between unmarried 
people and homosexuals — as 
well as married people. 

The report, which also 
recommended ordaining gays 
and lesbians and blessing 
their unions, offended many 
people in the church. 

The Rev. William Jame¬ 
son, a Pennsylvania pastor on 
the committee that drafted 
the new report, said, “Our re¬ 
port may not have been 
prophetic but it reassured 
people that the Presbyterian 
Church (USA) believes in ba¬ 
sic truths,” Jameson said. 
“What I was hearing when I 
left home is: We want to 
know if the church is going to 
maintain certain standards.” 

The new report, which 
was accepted by 96 percent of 
the 600 commissioners meet¬ 
ing in Baltimore, was ap¬ 
proved June 10 after a full 
day of discussion. 

Efforts to stray from the 
traditional positions espoused 
in the paper approved Mon¬ 
day — either by calling for 
stricter moral guidelines or 
for more acceptance of gays 
and lesbians — collapsed. 

The earlier report, “Keep¬ 
ing Body and Soul Together: 
Sexuality, Spirituality and So¬ 
cial Justice,” which was pre¬ 
pared by a 17-member com¬ 
mittee after four years of 
study, suggested the 2.9 mil¬ 
lion-member denomination 
support a new sexual ethic 
based on consent and mutual¬ 
ity rather than “heterosexist” 
and “patriarchal” considera¬ 
tions. ▼

Liberalizing Religion: 
Issue Is Here to Stay 


United Press International 

WASHINGTON - After 
delegates to the General As¬ 
sembly of the Presbyterian 
Church (USA) voted strongly 
to reject recommendations 
loosening some strictures on 
sexual practices, Gordon 
Stewart, head of the commit¬ 
tee that called for the rejec¬ 
tion, noted wryly, “The issues 
raised will not go away.” 

Indeed, the sexual revolu¬ 
tion that began when the 
Baby Boom generation 
reached puberty is now firm¬ 
ly embedded in American life 
and little — including the fear 
of AIDS — is likely to make it 
go away. 

Even as the Presbyterians 
were debating — and, not un¬ 
expectedly, rejecting — the 
controversial report, which 
called for study of proposals 
that would endorse responsi¬ 
ble, loving relationships out¬ 
side of marriage, including 
those among homosexuals, 
the Census Bureau was re¬ 
leasing a report that found 
there were 2.9 million unmar¬ 
ried-couple households in 
1990. 

That is triple the number 
in 1980, when the AIDS epi¬ 
demic hit, and as many house¬ 
holds as there are Presbyteri¬ 
ans— the nation’s sixth largest 
Protestant denomination. 

And, as the Presbyterians 
in Baltimore wrestled with 
the contending claims of tra¬ 
ditional understandings of 
sexual morality and Biblical 
authority set against new 
sexual realities and an inclu¬ 
sive vision of the meaning of 
the Gospel, Episcopalians 30 1 
miles to the south, in Wash¬ 
ington, D.C., witnessed their 
bishop ordain a lesbian — liv¬ 
ing in a “longstanding, com¬ 
mitted” relationship — to the 
priesthood. 

No issue, from war to civil 
rights to doctrine, touches 
church life in quite the way as 
do questions of human sexual- 
ity. 

In the last three decades 
the rise of a strong feminist 
movement and the increasing¬ 
ly open and militant style of 
gay rights activists have em¬ 
broiled churches across the 
theological spectrum, includ¬ 
ing such conservative bastions 
as the Southern Baptist Con¬ 


vention and the? nation’s 
largest denomination, the Ro¬ 
man Catholic Church. 

For the Southern Baptists, 


Analysis 


now firmly in the hands of 
fundamentalists, the issues 
have been women’s ordina¬ 
tion and abortion; for Roman 
Catholics, birth control, wom¬ 
en’s ordination and abortion. 

While most mainline 
Protestant churches have long 
since liberalized their posi¬ 
tions on the women’s ordina¬ 
tion question and birth con¬ 
trol, they stumble against pos¬ 
sible schism on the issues of 
gay ordination and abortion. 

Next month the 3 million- 
member Episcopal Church 
will debate proposals to clar¬ 
ify the right of dioceses, such 
as Washington and Newark, 
N.J., to ordain sexually active 
homosexuals. 

The 5.4 million-member 
Evangelical Lutheran Church 
in America has already sus¬ 
pended two San Francisco 
congregations for ordaining 
three homosexual seminari¬ 
ans who refused to pledge to 
live celibate lives, and the is¬ 
sue will percolate along the 
edges of its convention in Au¬ 
gust. 

Conservatives in the Unit¬ 
ed Methodist Church have 
promised to make a rollback 
on abortion rights their top is¬ 
sue at next year’s General 
Conference while liberals will 
seek to relax the church’s 
stance declaring homosexual¬ 
ity incompatible with Chris¬ 
tian teaching. 

At the grass-roots level, 
where the issues are most in¬ 
tensely felt, the division 
seems to be between those 
who see the church as a sanc¬ 
tuary from the sexual turmoil 
of secular life and those who 
believe the institution must 
reach out in a non-judgmental 
way to embrace all people, no 
matter their sexual lifestyle. 

Both sides can point to bib¬ 
lical precedent. Neither side 
is likely to win a convincing 
victory any time soon. All 
that is certain are Stewart’s 
words, that the “issues ... will 
not go away” and that they 
will continue to cause pain, if 
not schism, for a long time to 
come. ▼

Thousands Turn Out 
For San Jose's 1st Gay Parade 


by Keith Clark 

San Jose’s Gay Pride Pa¬ 
rade, the first as part of the 
city’s annual Gay Pride Cele¬ 
bration after 16 years, came 
off without a hitch June 9. 

Hundreds of marchers, 
several dozen contingents and 
more than 5,000 spectators 
were on hand for the seven- 
block parade along Stockton 
Avenue. 

Last week a dozen transit 
posters advertising the parade 
and two-day celebration at 
the Santa Clara County Fair¬ 
grounds had been defaced in 
what organizers said they be¬ 
lieved was a “systematic hate 
crime.” 

The publicity generated 
over the vandalism, however, 
had no adverse effect and 
may have actually helped 
draw more people to the pa¬ 
rade and celebration, organiz¬ 
ers believe. 

Pride Committee spokes¬ 
man Jon Vassil estimated 
there were 600 people in 
some 40 contingents in the 45- 
minute parade. Both Mayor 
Susan Hammer and the Santa 
Clara Board of Supervisors 
had issued proclamations 
declaring June 3-9 “Lesbian 
and Gay Pride Week” to 
mark the celebration. 

“It was something I’ll nev¬ 
er forget,” Vassil said. “It’s a 
wonderful feeling. We do this 
basically to make people feel 
proud that they’re gay, that 
gay is good. And I hope that 
maybe by seeing this, some 



other people who are in the and more comfortable to 
closet will feel more inclined come out of their closet.” And 



coming out of the closet was 
exactly what Queer 
Nation/South Bay got several 
parade-goers along the route 
to do. Sporting a mock-up 
closet door, the Queer Nation¬ 
als periodically stopped along 
the parade route and invited 
onlookers to join them in the 
street and walk through their 
closet door.

CIA 

(Continued from page 4) 

on sexual orientation, but has 
argued in court that such a 
policy would be nevertheless 
appropriate in the interests of 
national security, citing state 
sodomy laws. 

The agency’s attorneys 
have also insisted that les¬ 
bians and gays are subject to 
coercion or blackmail by for¬ 
eign powers because of their 
sexual orientation. 

Gayer, however, says the 
government’s concern isn’t 
sodomy or even the possibil¬ 
ity of blackmail but simple 
discomfort. 

“If the CIA was really wor¬ 
ried about sodomy,” Gayer 
said, “it would deny clear¬ 
ances to 90 percent of hetero¬ 
sexuals. Clearly this issue is 
nothing more than a fairy tale 
offered by the CIA. 

“What’s annoying and wor¬ 
risome is that they’re saying 
this agreement is only be¬ 
tween them and Julie Dubbs,” 
Gayer said. “Does that mean 
they’re exerting the right to 
discriminate against other gay 
people? Why should they 
make that distinction? It sug¬ 
gests that they’ve got some¬ 
thing up their sleeves.” 

In the settlement in the 
Dubbs case, while explicitly 
avoiding any admission of li¬ 
ability, the CIA nevertheless 
agreed that “homosexual con¬ 
duct and associations will be 
considered in the same man¬ 
ner as heterosexual conduct 
and associations.” 

Gayer said the terms of the 


settlement, which must still 
be approved by U.S. District 
Court Judge Eugene Lynch, 
are “restricted to Dubbs’ case 
alone.” 

Gayer said the settlement 
and reconsideration of Dubbs’ 
application are “a big change” 
in government attitudes on 
security clearances even 
though the agreement techni¬ 
cally applies only to Dubbs’ 
case. 

According to Gayer, even 
with that narrow focus, the 
settlement has real implica¬ 
tions for any other sexual ori¬ 
entation discrimination case 
involving CIA security clear¬ 
ances. 

“My position is they can¬ 
not treat Julie Dubbs one 
way, let’s say fairly, and treat 
all the other gay people un¬ 
fairly,” he told the B.A.R. “If 
they’re exerting the right to 
discriminate against all other 
gay people, that would be un¬ 
constitutional because you 
can’t single out one person for 
favorable treatment and treat 
everybody else badly.” 

Lynch is expected to ap¬ 
prove the CIA-Dubbs settle¬ 
ment agreement this month. 
Dubbs must then reapply for 
the security clearance, and 
the CIA then has 90 days to 
determine whether to accept 
or reject her application. If 
they reject it, they must tell 
her why. 

Gayer said if Dubbs is de¬ 
nied the clearance again, no 
new lawsuit would be re¬ 
quired and she can simply go 
back to Lynch and ask him to 
review the CIA explanation.

One flat-bed float, spon¬ 
sored by the Billy DeFrank 
Community Center, featured 
a railroad car, the “Rainbow 
Express,” that might just as 
easily have been called the 
lesbian/gay freedom train. 

The San Jose celebration 
for the past 16 years has con¬ 
sisted of a weekend celebra¬ 
tion, but not a parade until 
this year, and organizers said 
they were overwhelmed by 
the response to both. 

Last year’s two-day fair¬ 
ground festival drew 5,000 
people. This year more than 
11,000 people attended, with 
at least 6,000 people on Sun¬ 
day, largely from the parade. 

The fairground celebra¬ 
tion, contrasted with San 


Francisco’s more hedonistic 
extravaganza, was promoted 
as “a true family event.” Child 
care was available, daytime 
entertainers toned down any 
risque material, and there 
were carnival games. The fes¬ 
tival even took place in the 
fairground’s Family Park. 

But after the kiddies had 
been packed off to their beds 
in the evening, the adults had 
their crack at raising the roof 
with non-stop dancing and en¬ 
tertainment by the likes of 
Pamala Stanley, Jo-Carol, the 
San Jose Spurs and Ro- 
manovsky and Phillips. In the 
best all-American tradition, 
the Saturday night festivities 
concluded with a fireworks 
display. ▼ 



Rights Attorney Charged 
In Accused's Flight 


by Keith Clark 

A well-known San Jose gay 
rights attorney pleaded “no 
contest” to charges that in 
1988 he helped a client who 
was being investigated on 
child molestation charges flee 
the country. 

Bruce Nickerson surren¬ 
dered to authorities June 6 
and entered the no contest 


Kaminski is 
wanted on 
fugitive and 
child molesta¬ 
tion charges. 


plea in Santa Clara County 
Superior Court as part of a 
plea bargain, according to 
county district attorney offi¬ 
cials. 

Nickerson, 49, has been ac¬ 
tive in sexual civil rights liti¬ 
gation in the South Bay for a 
number of years, including 
cases concerning loiteringand 
lewd conduct charges. 

According to police 
charges in the case, Nickerson 
met with Carl Kaminski and 
Paul Chastain, a friend of 
Kaminski’s, in his office in 
1988 after police had begun 
investigating Kaminski on 
charges he molested two 10- 
year-old boys. 

According to sworn state¬ 


ments by Chastain, Nickerson 
told Kaminski he should 
leave the area until an order¬ 
ly surrender could be ar¬ 
ranged. 

Chastain testified that 
Nickerson had told the two 
men this was legal as long as 
criminal charges had not yet 
been filed. 

Chastain told authorities 
Nickerson was paid a $7,500 
retainer fee and that the attor¬ 
ney later drove Kaminski to 
his mobile home where 
Kaminski picked up some 
personal belongings. 

Chastain said the two men 
discussed changing money 
into German Deutsche marks 
and that Nickerson later 
drove Kaminski to San Fran¬ 
cisco International Airport. 

Following the no contest 
plea, Nickerson said, “I made 
a mistake. I misunderstood 
the law. I thought that what I 
was doing was perfectly le¬ 
gal.” 

Nickerson told authorities 
he had later tried to convince 
Kaminski to return to face 
the charges but had lost con¬ 
tact with the man shortly af¬ 
ter he left the country. 

Kaminski is now believed 
to have fled to Germany. He 
is wanted on fugitive charges 
as well as child molestation 
charges. 

Nickerson’s case comes up 
in Superior Court July 8. He 
faces a suspension of his li¬ 
cense, a $20,000 fine, up to 
one year in county jail and 
five years’ probation. ▼

Court To Rule on Legality 
Of Hate Crimes Statutes 


United Press International 

WASHINGTON- The 
Supreme Court on June 10 
agreed to decide the constitu¬ 
tionality of state and local 
laws aimed at stopping “hate 
crimes” by limiting expres¬ 
sion. 

The court’s next term will 
review a 1989 St. Paul, Minn., 
law that makes it a misde¬ 
meanor to engage in bias-mo¬ 
tivated disorderly conduct by 
speech or action that might 
arouse “anger, alarm or re¬ 
sentment in others on the ba¬ 
sis of race, color; creed, reli¬ 
gion or gender.” 

The case involves a 17- 
year-old white male prosecut¬ 
ed under the act for allegedly 
burning a cross in the yard of 
a black family last June. 

The youth, listed by the 
initials R.A.V., says while 
burning a cross in someone’s 
yard may violate trespassing 
and even assault laws, the or¬ 
dinance under which he was 


prosecuted is unconstitution¬ 
ally overbroad. 

A district court agreed, but 
the Minnesota Supreme 
Court said the statute could 
be “narrowly interpreted” to 
cover only those actions not 
protected by the First 
Amendment. 

The Minnesota Supreme 
Court said burning a cross in 
public symbolized “virulent 
notions of racial supremacy,” 
and that the statute legally 
can be narrowed to outlaw 
only “expressive conduct that 
amounts to ‘fighting words,’ ” 
or conduct “directed to incit¬ 
ing or producing imminent 
lawless action and is likely to 
incite or produce such ac¬ 
tion.” 

R.A.V.’s attorney argues 
that while as a society “it 
may be our responsibility or 
obligation to confront such 
‘notions,’ it is a violation of 
the First Amendment free¬ 
dom of speech clause to at¬ 
tempt to prohibit the expres¬ 


sion of racial or ethnic 
supremacy.” 

Minnesota argues the law 
is proper and in fact neces¬ 
sary in the face of a growing 
number of “hate crimes” 
aimed at minorities, gays and 
women. 

In this case, R.A.V. and 
five other young white males 
allegedly discussed causing 
“skinhead trouble” and then 
burned the cross on the lawn 
of the only black family in the 
neighborhood. 

“When symbolic conduct is 
designed solely to threaten, 
terrorize or injure others, it is 
not protected by the First 
Amendment,” the state said. 

The Minnesota Civil Liber¬ 
ties Union, in a friend-of-the- 
court brief, said while R.A.V’s 
actions were “repugnant” and 
“degrading,” he could have 
been prosecuted through 
means other than a “hopeless¬ 
ly flawed” statute that could 
be used to outlaw many ac¬ 
tions that now are protected.

2,000 Attend Pride Fest Near Detroit 

ROYAL OAK, Mich. (UPI) — An estimated 2,000 gays and 
their supporters gathered at Oakland Community College’s 
Royal Oak campus June 2 for the third annual PrideFest 
sponsored by the Detroit Area Gay and Lesbian Council. 
That’s about twice the number who attended last year’s fes¬ 
tival, organizers said. PrideFest ’91 kicks off a month of gay 
pride activities in Michigan, including a pride march in 
Lansing on June 23, titled “Respect, Recognition, Resolve.” 
At the June 2 event, at least 100 vendors lined the school’s 
concourse area, selling everything from hand-made jewelry 
and T-shirts to books. Many of the booths were political or 
educational in nature, including booths for friends of gays, 
families of gays and for gay Catholics, Jews and atheists. 
PrideFest organizer Frank Colasonti Jr. said gays and les¬ 
bians want the same legal protections guaranteed to any mi¬ 
nority. He said his organization wants to erase stereotypes 
about homosexuals and educate the non-gay public. 

'Simpsons' AIDS Fundraiser 

HOLLYWOOD (UPI) — Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. 
will release original animation cels from its TV cartoon se¬ 
ries The Simpsons for the first time at an art auction. 
Twenty-seven original production cels will be auctioned at 
Christie’s Galleries in New York June 20 with the funds to 
be donated to AIDS Project Los Angeles. The cels repre¬ 
sent various first season episodes of The Simpsons’ series 
and will be signed by Matt Groening, creator of the cartoon 
characters. Buyers also will receive corresponding original 
pencil drawings the animators sketched out before painting 
the cels. 

Rutgers Honors Gay Leader 

Rutgers University has awarded James D. Anderson, 
associate dean and professor in the School of Communica¬ 
tion, Information and Library Studies at Rutgers University, 
a public service award for his work with lesbian and gay 
issues in the Presbyterian Church, the state of New Jersey 
and at Rutgers. This is the first time the university has 
granted a university award for contributions related to les¬ 
bian and gay concerns. The Class of ’62 $1,000 Public Serv¬ 
ice Award, funded by the Class of 1962, honors members of 
the faculty, students, or administrators “in recognition of a 
service such as scholarly contributions, voluntary commu¬ 
nity leadership, and personal acts of heroism in an emergen¬ 
cy.” In 1984 the Advocate listed Anderson as one of the 400 
national leaders of the lesbian and gay community. In April 
1990 the New Jersey Lesbian and Gay Coalition, a state-wide 
organization of the major lesbian and gay organizations 
across the state, awarded Anderson their Achievement 
Award for his work for lesbian and gay equality in the 
church, the university and the state of New Jersey. 

Mass. Governor Backs Gay Board 

Massachusetts Republican Gov. William Weld endorsed a 
controversial bill that would create a lesbian and gay ad¬ 
visory board for the state Department of Health and Human 
Services. The advisory board would focus on the needs of 
gay youth, especially on gay teen suicide, through outreach 
to gay and lesbian teens in public schools. The bill was kiled 
last year in part by other gay lobbyists who feared it would 
detract attention from the gay civil rights bill. This year the 
bill has 30 co-sponsors in the House and has been given a 
favorable nod from the Legislature’s joint Committee on 
Human Services. The governor’s support is expected to 
sway opposition in the legislature and from church groups.

Seattle Gay Scholarships 

Two Seattle area students, a gay man and a lesbian, have been 
awarded the first two scholarships of $2,500 each as part of a fund 
stated this year by the Greater Seattle Business Association, a 
local gay and lesbian business group. The students, one a high 
school senior and the other a college freshman, were selected 
from among 15 applicants. Selecting the two scholarship reci¬ 
pients culminates more than a year’s planning, research and 
fundraising to bring such a program to the Northwest. Los 
Angeles, San Francisco and a few other cities around the coun¬ 
try have similar programs. Within weeks after the introduction 
of the fund, checks began to appear, including an anonymous 
gift of $25,000. Organizers hope to generate an endowment fund 
that ranges consistently between $150,000 and $250,000, there¬ 
by allowing two $2,500 scholarships to be awarded each year, 
with additional ongoing support for past recipients.

Vaccine 


(Continued from page 1) 


for fighting disease,” said 
Redfield. 

Dani Bolognesi, a re¬ 
searcher at Duke University 
in Durham, N.C., who special¬ 
izes in vaccine studies, called 
the finding a “very important 
lead” in AIDS research. But 
he stressed that it was also 
very preliminary. 

“While this is an interest¬ 
ing development, it needs to 
be followed up,” he said. 

In an editorial accompany¬ 
ing the study, Dr. Anthony 
Fauci of the National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Dis¬ 
eases said the study “en¬ 
hances the feasibility of post¬ 
infection immunization, a 
strategy against HIV infection 
originally suggested” by polio 
vaccine developer Dr. Jonas 
Salk in 1987. 

If follow-up studies now 
under way show the vaccine 
can stall the progress of HIV 
infection to full-blown AIDS, 
the result could be a drug 
that is cheaper, less toxic and 
easier to administer than 
AZT, the only government-ap¬ 
proved AIDS drug, Redfield 
said. 

Although gpl60 apparently 


boosts the body's own im¬ 
mune response to HIV infec¬ 
tion in novel ways, Bolognesi 
said the precise mechanism of 
how it works is not known. 

In contrast, it is known 
that AZT and a chemical rel¬ 
ative being studied as an 
AIDS therapy — the drug ddl 
— work by interfering with an 
enzyme the virus needs to re¬ 
produce. 

Unlike AZT and ddl, 
which can cause a number of 
toxic side effects, the gpl60 
vaccine appeared to cause no 
side effects in the new study 
except for occasional tender¬ 
ness and swelling of the skin 
at the site of inoculation. 

If gpl60 and other vaccines 
under development by Salk 
and French researcher Dr. 
Daniel Sagury “work — and 
that is a big if — it is likely 
that they will be cheap, rela¬ 
tively easy to give and unlike¬ 
ly to be associated with toxi¬ 
city,” said Redfield. 

While AZT needs to be 
taken every day, Redfield 
said gpl60 has been effective 
in boosting the immune sys¬ 
tems of study volunteers 
through booster shots admin¬ 
istered every four months af¬ 
ter the initial six-month se¬ 
quence. 

In the study, which in¬ 
volved 30 people ages 18 to 49 
in an early stage of HIV infec¬ 
tion, halt ot the subjects were 


given three injections of 
gpl60 over four months, 
while the other half received 
six injections for six months. 

The vaccine, which is 
made from the protein cover¬ 
ing of the AIDS virus, was 
developed by MicroGeneSys 
Inc. of Meriden, Conn. 

Overall, the injections 
boosted the body’s immune 
responses to the virus in 19 of 
of the 30 people in the study, 
Redfield said. Nearly 90 per¬ 
cent responded to the six-in¬ 
jection schedule, but that fig¬ 
ure fell to 40 percent among 
those who received only three 
injections. 

The vaccine is now being 
tested in an expanded study 
involving members of the 
Army, Navy and Air Force 
and as many as 500 people 
are expected to take part in 
the research, he said. He was 
uncertain when results would 
be ready. 

Bolognesi predicted that 
“we can move along quickly 
from this point. If the trend 
that has been started contin¬ 
ues, we might see therapeutic 
AIDS'vaccines available be¬ 
fore too long.” 

A number of vaccines are 
also being studied to prevent 
people from becoming infect¬ 
ed with the AIDS virus. But 
research has not yet shown 
whether any may be effective.

$50 Million OK'd 
For AIDS Housing 


by Cliff O'Neill 

WASHINGTON - Mark¬ 
ing the first time that a body 
of Congress has ever ap¬ 
proved funds for AIDS-specif¬ 
ic housing, the U.S. House in 
early June approved $50 mil¬ 
lion for a housing assistance 
program for low income peo¬ 
ple with AIDS and HIV infec¬ 
tion. 

The AIDS housing money 
was included in the fiscal 
1992 appropriations bill for 
the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development. The 
line item allows for the imple¬ 
mentation of a far-reaching 
housing bill approved by 
Congress last year that in¬ 
cluded provisions for the na¬ 
tion’s first federal AIDS hous¬ 
ing effort. 

The 1990 AIDS measure, 
the AIDS Housing Opportuni¬ 
ties Act, targets federal dol¬ 
lars to help prevent homeless¬ 
ness among people with 
AIDS and HIV infection. 

As passed by Congress, the 
authorization bill had allowed 
for a full $150 million to be 
spent on the AIDS housing 
project in fiscal ’92. But facing 
financial constraints across 
the entire spectrum of the 
HUD money bill, the House 
agreed to appropriate only 
$50 million for the program’s 
first year. 

Noting the limited funds 
allowed for the entire HUD 
money bill, however, AIDS 
housing advocates were 
pleased that the House gave 
them as much as it did. 

Increased dollars for AIDS 


housing and other programs 
in the HUD money bill ap¬ 
pear to hinge on the con¬ 
tentious battle over funding 
of research into a manned 
space station, a costly project 
backed by the Bush adminis¬ 
tration but opposed by sever¬ 
al congressional backers of 
domestic programs. 

In a surprise move, the 
costly space program funding 
for the coming fiscal year had 
been killed in a House sub¬ 
committee in late May on a 
straight party-line vote. 

House Democrats on the 
committee had argued that 
the millions set aside for the 
space station research would 
be better spent on a number 
of domestic programs. 

However, after an eleventh 
hour lobbying blitz by the 
Bush administration, the full 
House reinstated funding for 
the effort, bringingabout cuts 
in a number of other pro¬ 
grams, including many in the 
HUD bill. 

The battle over the space 
station funding and the feder¬ 
al money it ties up now 
moves to the Senate, where 
the appropriations process 
usually runs a month behind 
the House. 

With conservative Sen. 
Jake Garn (R-Utah), a fierce 
proponent of space programs, 
as the ranking Republican 
senator on the subcommittee 
that will review the space sta¬ 
tion’s future, AIDS activists 
are now worried that the sta¬ 
tion’s funding may come at 
the expense of the AIDS 
housing program. ▼ 


University Faculty 
Targets ROTC 


United Press International 

PITTSBURGH - The 
pressure is mounting to get 
the University of Pittsburgh 
to bar ROTC from campus af¬ 
ter 1997, unless the program 
stops discriminating against 
gays and lesbians. 

The Faculty Assembly on 
June 4 unanimously endorsed 
a University Senate commit¬ 
tee report recommending the 
five-year deadline. 

The report was to be dis¬ 
cussed again at the full Uni¬ 
versity Senate meeting June 
10 . 

The U.S. Department of 
Defense prohibits admitted 
homosexuals from serving in 
the military and enrolling in 
ROTQ although they are per¬ 
mitted to take ROTC courses 
and receive academic credit 
for them. 

The Pitt committee has 
discussed the issue with 


report to incoming Pitt Pres¬ 
ident John Dennis O’Conner. 
It also will be given to the 
board of trustees’ academic 
affairs committee. 

The ad hoc University 
Senate committee was 
formed last fall after protests 
against ROTC’s anti-homosex¬ 
ual policy by the American 
Civil Liberties Union and stu¬ 
dent groups across the coun¬ 
try, including Pitt’s Gay and 
Lesbian Alliance. 

The report, released last 
week, said among other 
things: 

— The anti-homosexual pol¬ 
icy conflicts with Pitt’s policy 
on equal employment and af¬ 
firmative action; 

— Pitt and other major uni¬ 
versities should try to influ¬ 
ence the Defense Department 
to reverse its policy on homo¬ 
sexuals; 

— Students who are in 
ROTC or applying to the pro-

AIDS No. 2 Cause of Death 
Among Men Aged 2544 


United Press International 

ATLANTA — Assessing 
the U.S. AIDS epidemic 10 
years after it began, federal 
health officials are projecting 
the disease will become the 
second leading cause of death 
of young men and one of the 
five leading causes of death 
among young women in 1991. 

“Clearly, AIDS is taking its 
place as a common cause of 
death of young adults in the 
United States,” Dr. James 
Curran, director of the AIDS 
division of the Centers for 
Disease Control Said June 6. 

“By the end of 1991 AIDS 
will be the second leading 
cause of death among men 25- 
44 years of age and is likely 
to be one of the five leading 
causes of death among wom¬ 
en aged 15-44 years in the 
United States,” Curran said. 

Only unintentional injuries 
will take more lives of young 
men than AIDS, and the in¬ 
curable ailment probably will 
join cancer, unintentional in¬ 
juries, heart disease, suicide 
and homicide as the top 
killers of young women, he 
said. 

The first cases of the ill¬ 
ness, later named acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome, 
were reported by doctors in 
California on June 5, 1981. 

As of May 31, the CDC 
had received reports of 


179,136 AIDS cases and more 
than 113,000 deaths for a fatal¬ 
ity rate of 63 percent. 

Last year there were 
43,339 cases, accounting for 
more than one-fourth of cases 
reported since 1981. So far 
this year, 17,893 cases have 
been counted. 

The World Health Organi¬ 
zation estimated that as many 
as 10 million adults and 1 mil¬ 
lion children worldwide are 
infected with HIV. That num¬ 
ber may grow to 40 million 
by the turn of the centum, 
with 90 percent of those in¬ 
fected living in developing 
countries. 

In addition, during the 
1990s, mothers or both par¬ 
ents of more than 10 million 
children will have died of the 
infection, the United Nations 
agency said. 

“AIDS will remain a major 
public health challenge world¬ 
wide in the 21st century. Ed¬ 
ucation of all persons about 
AIDS to prevent transmission 
of HIV infection is critical to 
controlling this problem,” the 
CDC said. 

Although about three- 
fourths of AIDS cases have 
occurred among homosexual 
and bisexual men and intra¬ 
venous drug users, in 1990 the 
incidence of AIDS increased 
most rapidly among the het¬ 
erosexual population, the 
CDC said. 


The disease appears to be> 
spreading faster among wom¬ 
en than men. 

For young women the dis¬ 
ease is expected to move 
from the eighth leading cause 
of death in 1988 and 1989 to 
the fifth leading cause of 
death in 1991, an official said. 

During a hearing in Wash¬ 
ington, Rep. Ted Weiss (D- 
N.Y.) criticized the lack of dis¬ 
ability benefits for women 
with AIDS. 

“HIV disease is being con¬ 
tracted by women at a higher 
rate than any other group in 
the U.S.” he said. “It is 
shameful that they are denied 
benefits that could enable 
them to provide even mini¬ 
mal support for themselves 
and their children.” 

Curran said the increasing 
spread of AIDS into the het¬ 
erosexual population is being 
expedited through contact 
with intravenous drug users. 

“Unless we can deal with 
the problem of drug use, it’s 
going to be very difficult to 
reduce the rate of heterosexu¬ 
al transmission. The 
problems are inextricably re¬ 
lated,” he said. 

Nationally, the rate of in¬ 
crease in AIDS cases was 
largest in the South last year 
than in other regions, part of 
the shift in greater transmis¬ 
sion rates from big cities to 
small cities and rural areas. ▼

AIDS Inaction Protested at White House 

WASHINGTON — As the 10-year anniversary of the report¬ 
ing of the first cases of what came to be known as AIDS 
passed June 5, activists speaking for those affected by the 
disease came to the White House to put across their most 
urgent point: They are still waiting. Gathering outside the 
gates of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., the group of 25 AIDS 
demonstrators commemorated the anniversary with chants 
and signs, all laying the blame for the nation’s estimated 
110,530 AIDS deaths at the feet of the Reagan and Bush ad¬ 
ministrations. “Leadership not silence,” they chanted, “a 
decade is too long.” The White House, ironically, had no 
comment on the anniversary. Ten demonstrators held aloft 
10 cardboard cutouts of tombstones, each of which bore a 
year and the total number of American AIDS deaths at the 
end of that year. Starting with 1981’s reports of 154 total 
deaths in the U.S., the activists successively read aloud the 
deadly toll the disease had in each year and summarized 
what action, if any, the White House took on the epidemic 
in that year. The new U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Antonia 
Novello, also came in for criticism for not pressing the 
White House to take a leadership position on the epidemic, 
as did her predecessor, C. Everett Koop. — Cliff O'Neill 

Teen PWA Receives Death Threats 

SARASOTA, Fla. (UPI) — A 14-year-old person with AIDS 
who announced he was marrying his teen-age girlfriend has 
received death threats along with his family. Sheriffs offi¬ 
cials are providing 24-hour protection, authorities said June 
7. Clifford Ray, the father of Ricky Ray, told the Sarasota 
County Sheriffs Department June 6 that he had received 
three threatening telephone calls. The threats apparently 
stem from Ricky’s announcement last week that he plans to 
marry Wenonah Lindberg, 16, on Dec. 13. Clifford Ray 
told the Sarasota Herald Tribune that one caller told him if 
the marriage goes through, both families will die. He 
said another caller threatened: “If you think Arcadia was 
bad, you haven’t seen anything,” an apparent reference to 
when the Rays’ Arcadia home was gutted by an arson fire 
in 1987. Ray also told the newspaper his children and his 
wife, Louise, would not stay at their home Thursday night 
because he feared for their safety. Ray, who would not re¬ 
veal where the family would go or when they would return, 
said friends would stay at the home until their return. 

Coming Home Catalano Project 

The Catalano Project is a new program developed by Com¬ 
ing Home Support Services. Its goal is to provide represen¬ 
tative payee services to indigent persons who are AIDS/ARC 
active and have been determined by the Social Security Ad¬ 
ministration to be in need of those services. These services 
are offered free of charge. For more information about the 
program, write to The Catalano Project, 41 Sutter St., Suite 
1440, San Francisco, CA 94114. 

Virology Institute Director Named 

Warner Greene, M.D., a noted molecular biologist and physi¬ 
cian from Duke University, has been named director of a 
new institute of virology and immunology devoted to the 
study of AIDS, which will be an integral part of the 
Gladstone Foundation at San Francisco General Hospital. 
This will be one of the largest virology/immunology 
research institutes in the United States dedicated to the 
study of human immunodeficiency virus disease. Mayor Art 
Agnos, who played an active role in recruiting Greene, ex¬ 
pressed confidence that the appointment would strengthen 
the institute’s mission. Greene will begin his duties on Sept. 

1 at the institute, which is located on two new floors on top 
of an existing building at San Francisco General Hospital. 

Participants Sought for Care Study 

University of California at San Francisco researchers are 
seeking friends, partners and family members who are car¬ 
ing for an adult with AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection 
for a new study of the experience of these caregivers. More 
than 500 persons will be interviewed to learn about the day- 
to-day lives of informal caregivers for persons with AIDS or 
HIV infection. People can participate in the study if they are 
lovers, friends or family members who provide help or care. 
Interested persons may contact Linda Wardlaw, project coor¬ 
dinator, at 476-7732, or Lisa Canin or Doug Sebesta at 
476-7733. Caregivers who participate in the study will be in¬ 
terviewed in person three times during a 12-month period. 
They will receive $25 per interview.

French Blood Center Delayed 
Move to Stop Spread of AIDS 


United Press International 

PARIS — The National 
Center for Blood Transfusion 
waited several months, per¬ 
haps up to two years, before 
acting to prevent the spread 
of AIDS from infected blood 
products, spurning available 
technology from the United 
States, it was reported June 8. 

Liberation and Le Fi¬ 
garo, both citing documents 
from the blood center, said of¬ 
ficials were aware of tech¬ 
niques to sterilize blood prod¬ 
ucts but did not take action 
until October 1985. 

About 1,200 of the 3,000 
hemophiliacs treated at state- 
operated transfusion centers 
around France are believed to 
have been infected with the 
AIDS virus as a result of 
transfusions and 200 have 
died. Some groups blame 
negligence of blood center 
and Health Ministry officials. 

The controversy has been 
simmering for several weeks, 
since a French magazine re¬ 


ported that blood center offi¬ 
cials knowingly provided in¬ 
fected blood products to 
hemophiliacs for several 
months in 1985. 

On June 10, Michel Garetta 
resigned as director of the 
state transfusion center and 
Health Ministry officials ac¬ 
knowledged that “grave col¬ 
lective errors” were commit¬ 
ted at the center. 

Liberation reported that 
blood transfusion specialists 
were aware of the risk and of 
techniques to neutralize the 
virus in blood products in 
summer 1984 when the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control 
recommended the method in 
the United States. 

The newspaper said 
French officials refused to im¬ 
port the U.S. technique com¬ 
mercialized by Abbott Labo¬ 
ratories in early 1985, prefer¬ 
ring to wait for the Pasteur 
Institute to develop a “French 
method.” 

Le Figaro said the dan¬ 
gers of infected blood were 


known to French officials as 
early as 1983, and noted that 
another U.S. firm, Travenol, 
received approval to dis¬ 
tribute sterilized blood prod¬ 
ucts in that year. 

The Le Figaro report 
said that a French Health 
Ministry official warned of 
dangers of contaminated 
blood in a memo dated June 
20, 1983, but that blood center 
officials failed to act on the 
warnings. 

In June 1985 a note from 
Garetta made public in sev¬ 
eral reports indicated the di¬ 
rector believed 100 percent of 
the center’s blood supplies 
were contaminated. 

The government issued a di¬ 
rective later the same month, 
but untreated blood products 
continued to be distributed 
until October 1985. 

Liberation said the direc¬ 
tor made the decision to use 
up stocks of infected blood 
products based on “a simple 
financial analysis.” ▼ 


Fla. Dental Patient 
Reported Near Death 


United Press International 

FORT PIERCE, Fla. - A 
23-year-old woman who con¬ 
tracted AIDS from her den¬ 
tist in the first known case of 
a doctor passing the disease 
to a patient is close to death, 
her attorney said June 7. 

Kimberly Bergalis, who 
became seriously ill six weeks 
ago, is unaware that two fel¬ 
low patients of Dr. David 
Acer were added by the Cen¬ 
ters for Disease Control in At¬ 
lanta to the list this week of 
those believed to have con¬ 
tracted the disease from him. 

So far, a total of five of 
Acer’s patients have tested 
positive for the HIV virus or 
developed full-blown AIDS. 
Bergalis is the most seriously 
ill. 

“She is not expected to 
live. It’s on a day-to-day basis, 
I’m afraid,” attorney Robert 
Montgomery said. 

“She wanted to die at 
home. ... All the family is 


there. Her liver and other in¬ 
ternal organs are failing. She 
hasn’t eaten anything, just 
Gatorade. It’s just a typical 
AIDS death.” 

The identities of the two 
latest patients infected by 
Acer have not been released. 
CDC officials rely on a 
method called gene sequenc¬ 
ing to determine that the HIV 
strain of the patients matches 
that found in Acer. 

Acer died of the disease 
Sept. 3, 1990, just days after 
notifying his patients he had 
AIDS. Two months earlier, 
the CDC had reported that 
there was one case in which a 
patient had contracted the dis¬ 
ease from a doctor. 

The week Acer died, 
Bergalis identified herself as 
that patient and launched a 
successful suit against the 
dentist’s estate and the insur¬ 
ance company that referred 
her to him.

Health Worker 
Infected With 
HIV on Job 
Dies of AIDS 

United Press International 

SACRAMENTO - A 
nurse who was the nation’s 
first health-care worker 
known to have been infected 
with AIDS on the job has 
died, it was reported June 6. 

Joanne Ruiz, 42, contracted 
the virus after being accident¬ 
ly stuck by a contaminated 
needle at Mercy Hospital of 
Sacramento four years ago. 
She died at her home June 3 
of complications from AIDS. 

“She was never ashamed 
of having the illness,” her 
friend, Linda Tutor, told the 
Sacramento Bee. “She 
stressed that everyone should 
take every precaution and 
provide care with compas¬ 
sion.” 

The accidental infection 
occurred in July 1987, after 
Ruiz had drawn blood from 
an AIDS patient. 

She was wearing a protec¬ 
tive mask, gown and gloves, 
but while transferring the 
blood into vials, the syringe 
slipped and the needle 
plunged into her thigh, de¬ 
positing nearly a teaspoonful 
of AIDS-infected blood. 

A month later Ruiz came 
down with severe flu-like 
symptoms that lasted for five 
weeks. In September, on her 
39th birthday, she learned she 
had AIDS. 

The federal Centers for 
Disease Control in Atlanta re¬ 
ported in 1988 that the first 
health-care worker had devel¬ 
oped AIDS, but did not iden¬ 
tify the person. 

But the California Depart¬ 
ment of Health Service offi¬ 
cials confirmed Ruiz was the 
first. 

Ruiz made her story pub¬ 
lic, and while she was still 
healthy enough, she talked 
about AIDS in classrooms, 
conferences and before TV 
cameras. ▼

HIVCare 



Dead Men Do Donate 


by Michael C. Botkin 

any people have 
expressed surprise, 
if not necessarily 
doubt, at my asser¬ 
tion that Lee Atwater, hip, cool, 
evil genius of the Republican. 
National Committee, died of 
AIDS. He certainly wasn’t gay, 
in the sense of engaging in 
overt relationships with men. 
But brain lymphomas in men 
under 40 are an automatic red- 
alert for any serious obituary 
watcher, and concealment of 
this diagnosis by the main¬ 
stream media is, to my mind, 
proof. 

Still, I was glad to get con¬ 
firmation in the form of a 
clipping of the following item, 
published in the April 19 is¬ 
sue of the Washington Blade. 

“For reasons the Republi¬ 
can National Committee has 
yet been able to discern, its 
former chair, Lee Atwater, 
donated a station wagon load 
of unused medical supplies to 
the Whitman-Walker Clinic 
this month. Administrator Jim 
Graham said ‘two young 
men’ arrived unannounced at 
the clinic and offered him the 
materials. 

“He siad the men gave him 
the name and address of At¬ 
water’s wife for sending a 
thank you note. Graham said 
he had no idea why Atwater 
would have the supplies do¬ 
nated to Whitman-Walker 
and that, to his knowledge, 
Atwater (who died March 29) 
never used the clinic’s ser¬ 
vices.” 

There are several gaps in 
the information. Just what 
kind of medical supplies are 
we talking about? Incriminat¬ 
ing things like Pentamidine 
inhalers and AZT? Or generic 
stuff like adult diapers and IV 
columns? 

We hear that the men are 
“young,” but are we also to in¬ 
fer that they are “cute”? Did 
Atwater keep a stable of bub¬ 
ble-butt surfer-boy minions? 
Or were they just some Re¬ 
publican youth sent over to 
haul boxes for the widow? 

Whose Gift? 

And just who sent them 
with his stuff to the city 
AIDS clinic, and why? 

The most generous inter¬ 
pretation would be that Atwa¬ 
ter asked that his stuff be so 
donated upon his death. I 
sneered at his highly public 
last-minute conversion to 
Catholicism, the traditional 
refuge of the rogue, a hedged 
bet against hell. I jeered at his 
death bed visit from Ronald 
Reagan as a fitting farewell 
for a consummate hypocrite. 
But this gift, belated and tri¬ 
fling though it is, I can re¬ 


spect. 

It’s craven to deny any con¬ 
nection with your persecuted 
brethren until after your 
death. But at bottom line I’ve 
always defended the right of 
any oppressed person to 
“pass” to avoid punishment. If 
Atwater was making a gen¬ 
uine gesture of retribution 
and connection to HIVers, 
that’s worth something. 

One could easily argue that 
donating a few thousands dol¬ 
lars worth of supplies is poor 
recompense for being saddled 
with George Bush, and un¬ 
likely to supplant racism-mon- 
gering as his main claim to 
fame. Life is not a Hallmark 
card; when it comes to mat¬ 
ters of life and death it’s not 
enough just to show that you 
care. 

Still, it would be nice to 
think that Atwater was at 
least trying to reach out. 

But it may not have been 
Lee’s idea to send the stuff. It 
may have been his wife’s. 
The story refers to the deliv¬ 
ery boys giving the adminis¬ 
trator “the name and address 
of Atwater’s wife for sending 
a thank-you note.” 

Was she forced, unwilling 
to comply with Republican 
propagandists’ orders to con¬ 
ceal her husband’s HIV sta¬ 
tus? Was she less denying of 
Atwater’s condition, and less 
committed to rejecting his 
communality with us diseased 
pariahs? Maybe she was the 
human one, and he died 
unrepentant after all. 

Finally, maybe the young 
(cute?) men just grabbed the 
stuff on their own initiative 
and offered the note as cover. 
Well, to whoever’s decision 
this really was, thanks. 

Media Whore Central? 

By the time this column is 
published, I will be some¬ 
where over the Atlantic 
Ocean en route for the Sev¬ 
enth International Conference 
on AIDS, being held this year 
in Florence, Italy. 

Many wonder whether 
these events are worth the 
time and money spent on 
them. Recently, a prominent 
activist told me he wasn’t go¬ 
ing, and considered this year’s 
conference a “non-event.” 

But another activist, over¬ 
hearing this, later comment¬ 
ed, “She just doesn’t think it’ll 
give her any decent photo 
ops.” 

The conference is defend¬ 
ed for being a unique oppor¬ 
tunity for scientists to learn 
about the latest developments 
in AIDS research, and also a 
as great public relations 
event. Many scientists were 
upset with ACT UP’s 
takeover of the Montreal con¬ 


ference in 1989 not because it 
created publicity, but because 
they were so thoroughly up¬ 
staged. 

Media attention is a 
strange thing. Many covet it, 
but no one wants to appear 
too greedy in seeking it out. 
Protagonists of pure science 
say a media circus distorts re¬ 
search but, sighing, admit 
they could use some good, 
free PR themselves. 

Some scientists support 
themselves entirely by riding 
the hype cycle; look at the re¬ 
cent career of poor Dr. 
Robert Gallo. He got several 
years of fame and glory out of 
a stolen virus sample. Who 
says you can’t get something 
for nothing? 

No doubt there will be the 
usual quota of media sluts; 
maybe even Gallo himself, if 
he’s not feeling too foolish, 
and if his miracle KS drug is 
ready. But there may be some 
substance as well, if only be¬ 
cause every major scientist 
has been holding back his 
best research for this event. 

Ultimate Bias 

It will be interesting to see 
the state of the alliance be¬ 
tween researchers and AIDS 
activists. Unlike San Francis¬ 
co, or even Montreal, Flo¬ 
rence is pretty far away from 
any center of AIDS activism. 
Italy doesn’t even have an 
ACT UP chapter. Florence, 
according to my sources, has 
exactly two gay bars. What 
does “community involve¬ 
ment” mean in such a con¬ 
text? 

ACT UP/New York, ru¬ 
mor has it, is sending 75 peo¬ 
ple. But 75 activists alone at a 
conference compared to the 
same 75 activists with 5,000 
militant supporters just out¬ 
side is a big difference. 

Rumor also has it that the 
pure scientists are anxious to 
take advantage of this year’s 
inaccessible conference to roll 
back the norms a bit to 
counter the anarchistic effects 
of Montreal in ’89 and San 
Francisco in ’90. 

Moderates encourage these 
hard-liners to remember that 
next year’s conference will be 
held in Boston — “just an Am- 
trak away from New York.” 

What’s more, given the 
Bush administration’s recent 
craven reversal on lifting im¬ 
migration restrictions, yet an¬ 
other boycott and/or protest 
seems increasingly likely for 
the ’92 conference. 

Overall, this sounds like a 
draw. The scientists hold this 
year’s conference hostage, the 
activists hold next year’s. Mu¬ 
tual esteem and respect like 
this is the ultimate basis of all 
alliances. ▼

Deaths 


Joshua Elder Persky 

Nov. 17, 1964-June 5, 1991 

Surrounded by loved ones at R.K. 

Davies Hospital, 
Joshua Elder Per¬ 
sky left us by his 
own will on June 
5. His energy and 
passion astonish¬ 
ed all who knew 
him, and will 
continue to in¬ 
spire those he 
touched. 

A native San 
Franciscan, Josh¬ 
ua has been an active, vibrant member 
of the gay community all his life. He 
knew and stressed the importance of 
being who you are. He has always been 
a man of integrity and candor. 

Joshua helped to organize the San 
Francisco Spikes soccer team in 1982, 
and participated in all three Gay Games 
celebrations. He studied speech and 
communication at SFSU until his ill¬ 
ness overtook him in May 1990. He 
made a film at the university about HTV 
disease, and lectured to large audiences 
on homosexuality and AIDS. 

He worked at the Muscle System and 
was a DJ at the SF Eagle. He played for 
several large dances in the city; music 
was one of his many passions and, for 
him, the perfect expression of SF gay 
life. 

Although his physical presence is no 
longer with his, his strength and his 
spirit live on. As he stated with a small 
grin the day before he left us, “I’ll be 
waiting for you in the big disco in the 
sky.” 

Friends may gather at Mountain 
Lake Park, 10th Avenue and Lake 
Street, for a service on Sunday, June 16, 
11am. Contributions are welcome to 
his memorial fund at Larkin Street 
Youth Center Project Ahead, do Ron 
Henderson, 375 Woodside Ave., SF CA

John Henry "Jack" Spratt 

June 25, 1919-June 4, 1991 



Jack was bom in Covington, Ky., and 
died of liver dis¬ 
ease at Kaiser 
Hospice Center. 
As a senior gay 
activist, he was 
an active member 
of many organiz¬ 
ations including 
G-40 Plus, Gay 
and Lesbian Out¬ 
reach to Elders, 
Gay and Lesbian 
Historical Socie¬ 
ty, Theatre Rhinoceros, ACLU, Muse¬ 
um Society, Academy of Sciences and 
Gay Sierrans. 

He was a graduate of Eastern Ken¬ 
tucky State Teachers College in 1942 
and taught music in junior high schools 
in Wyoming and Kwajalein, Marshall 
Islands, before coming to San Francisco 
in 1974. 

During the 1980s he took several trips 
with FOG and was one of three senior 
gay men to carry the torch in the open¬ 
ing ceremonies of Gay Games II in 1986. 
He participated in two gay rights 
marches in Washington. The past two 
years he was acting with the senior ac¬ 
ting company Stagebridge in Oakland. 

He is survived by his brother and 
sister-in-law Joe and Nancy Spratt of Ft. 
Mitchell, Ky. 

The Neptune Society will scatter his 
ashes at sea and no memorial service. 


Timothy O'Neill 

March 25, 1956-May 31, 1991 

On May 31 Tim O’Neill made his 
transition at the 
Coming Home 
Hospice in San 
Francisco. 

Tim was bom 
in Redbluff and 
grew up in Chi¬ 
co. After he fin¬ 
ished his school¬ 
ing he lived in 
San Luis Obispo 
before moving to 
San Francisco in 
the early ’80s. Working as a software 
specialist in the city, Tim obtained 
employment with Tandem Computers 
in 1987, fulfilling a personal goal. Tim 
continued working for Tandem as a 
software designer until his health forc¬ 
ed him to go on disability in December 
1990. 

Tim was a fighter for his health and 
for the cause of AIDS. He was active in 
his work environment and his focus was 
on bringing the facts and realities on 
AIDS into the consciousness of “Main¬ 
stream Americans.” 

A memorial service will be held for 
Tim on June 15 at 11 a.m. at the Calvary 
Presbyterian Church, Fillmore and 
Jackson streets, San Francisco. ▼ 




Damian Lucas Kishann III 

Jan. 1, 1950-May 22, 1991 

Damian departed this earth on 
Wednesday, May 22, at St. Francis 
Hospital in San Francisco, at about 11:35 
p.m. after a relatively brief, painful 
struggle against AIDS. 

To the best of my knowledge he is 
survived by his twin brother in south¬ 
eastern Kentucky and his 17-year-old 
son in central Florida 
Damian was my best friend and he 
leaves a hole in my life that cannot be 
filled. I loved him and I hope he can 
now find the happiness that so eluded 
him here. 

Anyone wishing to help plan a cele¬ 
bration of his life is encouraged to call 
Mike at 864-5619. In his own words, we 
“don’t have Damian to kick around 
anymore ...” 


Michael M. Kile 


Jan. 9, 1947-May 25, 1991 



After a brief two-month illness, 
Michael died of 
complications re¬ 
lated to AIDS. 
He died peaceful¬ 
ly and at peace at 
his beloved home 
at Sea Ranch on 
the northern Cal¬ 
ifornia coast. 

Born, raised 
and educated in 
Indiana, Michael 
moved to San 
Francisco in 1979 where he lived for 12 
years before moving late last year to the 
north coast. With a degree in political 
science and art, he was a lover of beau¬ 
ty and contributed much to making the 
world a better place A highly successful 
publisher of books on American quilts, 
he greatly enhanced the art of quilt 
making and supported women in the 
telling of their history through the mak¬ 
ing of quilts. 

Michael was a bright, creative, ar¬ 
ticulate, compassionate, loving and car¬ 
ing man. As an activist he supported 
numerous human rights causes. He con¬ 
tributed to such organizations as the 
Names Project, the Experience Week¬ 
end and Open Hand. His “marriage” 
to songwriter Bill Folk became a public 
statement for the equality of all 
domestic partners. The event, held in 
the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden 
Gate Park in San Francisco was covered 


by TV networks and the print media, 
including Newsweek magazine. 

Michael is survived by his life part¬ 
ner, Bill Folk; his mother, June Kile of 
Scottsdale; his father and his father’s 
wife, Glen and Marge Kile of Danville, 
Ind.; his grandmother, Cora Kile of War¬ 
saw, Ind.; his spiritual sisters, Penny 
McMorris of Bowling Green, Ohio, and 
Julie Silver of Ross, Calif.; and so many 
friends they are too numerous to count 

A celebration of Michael’s life will be 
held on Saturday, June 15, at his home 
at Sea Ranch. His ashes will be scat¬ 
tered at sea off Black Point Beach where 
he loved to jog and watch the sun go 
down. For information, please call 
(1-800) 247-4499. 

Donations in Michael’s memory may 
be made to American Quilt Study 
Group, 660 Mission St., SF, CA 94105; 
Ms. Foundation, 141 5th Ave., Suite 6S, 
NYC, NY 10010; and/or to, Project Open

Henry George Helbig 

April 29, 1957-April 28, 1991 

Henry’s ashes were scattered into the 
San Francisco Bay between his two 
homes of Marin 
and the city. 

He took pride 
in having been a 
Marine and was 
a gentleman and 
sportsman at the 
pool table, gain¬ 
ing the respect 
and admiration 
of all who played 
the game. 

Henry was a 
San Francisco man of the night, driven 
by the passions of life and living the fan¬ 
tasies of the mind only few could real¬ 
ly know. 

There are few he met who did not feel 
a void at his passing. It was to the 
dispossessed, the addict, the men and 
women of the streets, the lame and 
troubled, people of all races, of all cir¬ 
cumstances, that he gave his heart. 

He left with reluctance his deeply lov¬ 
ed mother, Addy of Venetia; his father, 
Hank of Palm Springs; his sister, Joan 
of Studio City; and his extended fami¬ 
ly of Paul, Donovan and Alton. 

Assuredly St. Peter will have a shin¬ 
ing quarter and a pool cue at the heaven¬ 
ly portals, saying the words, “Henry, 
you’re up.” 'W

Peter G. Barrett 

Peter G. Barrett, 44, died on June 8 in 
San Francisco, of 
AIDS. 

Peter was a na¬ 
tional account 
executive of Win- 
terland Produc¬

David Salsbury 

March 26, 1947-May 17, 1991 

David always refused to abide by the 
rules — or to do the expected. Prevail¬ 
ing almost casually over KS for nearly 
seven years, he left his family and 
friends after a whirlwind month of ill¬ 
ness and decline. 

There were many facets to David. 
Brilliance in mathematics; loyal, 
challenging friendship; Zen; voracious 
consumer of science fiction; computers, 
of course; the primal scream; Japanese; 
avid swimmer and hiker; a piano he 
would let no one hear him play; rabid 
bridge player; hedonist and hippie; frac- 
i tals!; voyager to 
I Europe, Africa, 

: inside his own 
mind; and a great 
capacity to love. 
Few who knew 
him could keep 
If up with all the 
; different parts. 
David was told 
seven years ago 
that he would 
likely die within 
sue months, but he survived to take care 
of his lover and his best friend as each 
fought their own battle with AIDS. And 
he managed to find more time to help 
others in the same situation, all the 
while living a full life. No one who 
knew David will ever forget him. 

Friends will gather to remember 
David at the SF Eagle, Saturday, June 
15, from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., on the patio. 



Ricky Ray Hobgood 

Dec. 24, 1961-May 31, 1991 
A street kid, Ricky lived hard, played 
hard, and died young, caught by the 
Demon in our community. He didn’t 
want to leave so soon. Survived by 
Larry, Renard and family in Kentucky. 
—Jim Meyers. ▼ 


John M. Narancic 

April 27, 1961-May 21, 1991 



John died peacefully on the morning 
of May 21, atUC 
Medical Center 
in San Francisco 
During his last 
days he was sur¬ 
rounded by his 
friends, his par¬ 
ents and other fa- 
mily members. 
John was one of 
14 brothers and 
sisters aged 26 to 
45, all but two of 


whom live in Seattle. 

John loved San Francisco and lived 
here for most of the past eight years. He 
will be remembered for his charming 
playfulness, creativity, candor, childlike 
innocence, generosity and zest for life. 
He was clean and sober the last two 
years and maintained a positive 
spiritual attitude and sense of humor, 
despite serious liver problems and HIV- 
related illnesses. 

A memorial service for John was held 
on May 23, at St Dominic’s Church in 
San Francisco, and was attended by his 
parents, eight brothers and sisters, two 
nephews, and friends. 

Another memorial service will take 
place in Seattle in June Contact Robert 
at (415) 474-6381 for further information 
or to plan an event for friends who may 
have missed the memorial service 

Donations in John’s memory can be

choice 

John, you will always be part of those 
who loved you. 'W

Michael Patrick Smith 

1955-1991 

On May 28, in his hometown of Read¬ 
ing, Penn., Michael lost his brief battle 
8 with AIDS. He 



All the people he touched will fond¬ 
ly remember his startling good looks, 
boyish enthusiasm, disarming smile, 
mischievous charm and especially those 
probing blue eyes. 

Michael moved to Delaware in 1989

successful tri-state cable television in¬ 
stallation company.

sister, Shirley; brother, Randy; and

with AIDS. Chuck was born 
and educated in Gary, Indiana. 

He was a hard-working fund¬ 
raiser for many of the commu¬ 
nity’s charities. Among his 
favorites were the AIDS 
Emergency Fund and the God¬ 
father Service Fund. He 
founded Charity Bridge (now 
operating as Second Saturday 
Bridge), a fundraising event. 
Many different charities bene¬ 
fited from its largesse until the 
advent of AIDS. Since that 
time, all monies have gone to 
support different AIDS 
groups. 

Chuck was elected Emperor 
in 1979 and spent the year of 
his reign raising monies for 
myriad gay causes. He came to 
be known as an Emperor Nor¬ 
ton look-alike and would don 
regalia similar to the original 
Norton’s for all imperial func¬ 
tions. He displayed an above 
average pride in his role as 
Emperor VIII, After Norton. 

It was about this time that he 
left his job as an accountant for 
Shasta Beverages and began to 
work as a bartender in various 
gay bars. He was also a dedi¬ 
cated and long-time member 
of the Coits, a social and ser¬ 
vice organization in which he 
served with distinction in vir¬ 
tually every official position. 
He originated the annual fun- 
filled weekend for the Coits 
called Ski-Dazzle. 

Chuck’s last few years were 
spent as a bartender at the 
Mint where he naturally be¬ 
came involved with the award¬ 
winning annual Tricycle Race 
held every Memorial Day, with 
its attendant bathing beauty 
contest and other campy 
asides. A skiing and hiking en¬ 
thusiast, he also took particu¬ 
lar interest in weekend bike 
club runs. His outgoing per¬ 
sonality, friendly and warm, 
endeared him to many indi¬ 
viduals in the community who 
sought him out for help and ad¬ 
vice in their endeavors. 

It was Chuck’s fervent wish 
to be able to die at his home 
and to that end, he was 
thankful to Tom, Doug and 
Bert who, along with the Kai¬ 
ser Hospice doctors and nurs¬ 
ing staff, made that last wish 
possible. He was able to spend 
his last weeks at home with his 
brothers Larry and Dan, who 
spent time with Chuck and his 
friends in a caring, sharing, 
loving ambience. It was a lov¬ 
ing display of family support 
and appreciation. 

In addition to his brothers 
and a sister-in-law, Cheryl, 
Chuck is also survived by his 
parents, Fredia and Ralph 
Biggs of Merrillville, Indiana. 

Chuck Demmon, who serv¬ 
ed his community with distinc¬ 
tion and enthusiasm, will be 
greatly missed at the Mint and 
by his many friends and ac¬ 
quaintances. Donations may 
be made to any AIDS charity 
in Chuck’s name. ▼ 


A Closing Letter Fnmi Tim Light 

Charles Bowens HI 

May 19, 1954-Dec. 14, 1990 

Dear Charlie, 

On December 14, you stipped 
from my arms into the loving 
arms of your grandmother. 

God gave us nearly eight precious 
years together; during those years 
I came to reabze that we were tru¬ 
ly sold mates. 

You took me places emotionally, 
spiritually, and physically I did 
not know were possible. 

I felt as though we had become 
one. 

What a rare gift, not only to love 
you, but to be IN LOVE with 
you for the entire time we were 
together. 

How I loved to see you smile and hear your laughter, somehow, you could 
always make everything O.K. again. 

I want so much to hold you again and look into your eyes, but I know for 
now that is not possible. 

Thank you for showing me how to Love, Thist, Respect and Honor. 

It seems I miss you more and more each day, but it comforts me in knowing 
that our sweetest days together are just around the comer. 

I love you, Handsome!

John R. DeRousse 

March 12, 1947-May 30, 1991 

Our remarkable friend and 
brother died from liver failure 
due to AIDS at Kaiser Hospital, 

San Francisco, at 10:12 a.m. on 
Thursday, May 30, 1991. With 
him at the time of his death was 
his best friend, real estate part¬ 
ner and true lover at heart, 

Stephen A. Smith. Other surviv¬ 
ors include his longtime friend 
and confidante, John Morgan 
Jones; his beloved sister, Vel 
Browne; her husband, Ned 
Browne; and their children in¬ 
cluding Scott Alan Browne, as 
well as six other loving brothers 
and sisters and their families, 
and several aunts and uncles. 

John's family of friends in¬ 
cludes Jim Leuker, Jim Lewis, 

Donald Eustace, Jimmy Mc- 
Candless, Ghislaine Robinson, 

David Root, Michael German, Michael McCallister, and many others. 
John also leaves his devoted cats, Kitty (Mr. Bear) and Copper, whom 
he loved. 

John was preceded in death by his father, Clyde Alexis DeRousse, 
and by his mother, Hester Seiferd DeRousse, with whom he shared 
a special bond of love and support. 

Born and raised in St. Louis, Mo., John moved to Southern Cali¬ 
fornia in 1965 and attended California State University at Northridge, 
graduating with a BA in Art. He then began a 20 year career in 
teaching, interrupted by sales positions with Wally Findlay Galleries, 
Inc., and Neiman-Marcus Co., both of Beverly Hills. John returned 
to school and graduated from the Maria Montessori Institute in San¬ 
ta Monica. Thereafter he moved to San Francisco in 1983 and taught 
for five years as a kindergarten teacher at Big City Montessori School. 
In this capacity he demonstrated his talent, training and dedication 
as a Montessori teacher and his great love of children. His last posi¬ 
tion was education specialist at the Presidio San Francisco Child Care 
Center. 

John was a spiritual, intuitive, visual, creative, passionate, virile, 
romantic and emotionally sensitive individual with a childlike sense 
of joy and wonder, and a mad sense of humor and craziness. He pro¬ 
jected great strength, energy and love of life. John wrote the book on 
cleanliness and was meticulous in all his endeavors. He was a self¬ 
starter — strong-willed and single-minded. When he made up his 
mind to do something he did it. He didn't talk about things, he did 
them. 

John's lifetime hobby was real estate investment, which gave him 
the opportunity to exercise his extraordinary interior design talents. 
As a Pisces, he loved rain, wind and water. Other passions included 
the fine arts, photography, classical music, motorcycles, bike riding, 
nature, the beach, boating, landscaping, gardening, architecture, 
automobiles, antigue clocks and furnishings, fine food, champagne 
and men. 

John loved wisely and well. Though intensely private, he was open, 
loving and generous to others. This was a compliment to his intensely 
handsome appearance, his hunky frame, broad smile and penetrating 
blue eyes. 

He bore his illness with courage and little complaint, maintaining 
an active life and always looking ahead. He made a gift of putting 
his affairs in order despite the strain on his health. His legacy is his 
teaching career, his enduring love of friends and family, and his abili¬ 
ty to celebrate life and to laugh every day. 

At his request, John's remains were cremated and will be scattered 
outside the Golden Gate on Saturday, June 22. A reception in cele¬ 
bration of his life will follow immediately thereafter at his home at 4125 
17th Street. Call Steve at 626-4438 for details. 

I know the truth, John. You have kept your commitment. You will 
never leave me. 



We need you.

the breadth of gay and les¬ 
bian lives and gay bashing.” 

However, a Carolco repre¬ 
sentative is quoted as saying 
that he is not aware of the re¬ 
quest. 

“No such request has been 
made to me,” Roger Smith, 
Carolco executive vice presi¬ 
dent, told Variety. “We think 
all of these actions, state¬ 
ments and posturing are 
wrong. These people have not 
seen the movie. We don’t 
think there’s any unfair treat¬ 
ment of gays in the movie 
and we’re not going to partic¬ 
ipate in any form of prepubli¬ 
cation censorship. To us, this 
is like the Jesse Helms of the 
left.” 

Variety said other “more 
moderate” organizations also 
have taken offense at Basic 
Instinct. 

Richard Jennings, execu¬ 
tive director of Gay and Les¬ 
bian Alliance Against 
Defamation/Los Angeles, was 
quoted as saying that 
GLAAD has been denied a 
meeting with the producers 
until the film is completed. 

Carolco’s Smith said, 
“We’re not meeting now be¬ 
cause there is nothing to meet 
about. ... Once it’s produced 
(and released) they can picket 
and tell everybody it’s terrible 
if they want.” 

Los Angeles Queer Nation¬ 
al Richard Iosty contested 
Carolco’s suggestion that the 
Queer Nation protests are 
censorship. He points rather 
to the “enormously powerful” 
film industry, which prohibits 
self-representation by gays 
and lesbians and the subse¬ 
quent distortion that results. 

“We are for Hollywood the 
preferred embodiment of 
evil,” Iosty said. 

He contends that framing 
the argument about the 
movie in terms of the First 
Amendment rights of the stu¬ 
dios “changes the truth.” 

“The ideological intention 
of movies like Basic Instinct,” 
Iosty said, “is to displace bru¬ 
tality against women and 
queers — a violence and 
brutality that is structurally 
embedded in the ‘normative’ 
relations between men and 
women. Basic Instinct blames 
the victim by portraying 
women as murderers. We don’t 
have the power of censorship. 
We are censored.” 

As to the low turnout, Judy 
Sisneros pointed out that Los 
Angeles and San Francisco 
BAY AREA REPORTER JUNE 13, 


are two very different cities 
in terms of queer activism. 

“We’re more isolated in 
our cars here,” she said, “and 
much more assimilationist. 
There are a lot of queers in 
the (entertainment) industry 
who don’t want to lose their 
jobs. San Francisco has a his¬ 
tory of out and open activism. 
Many people in LA are un¬ 
aware of what we’re trying to 
do, so it might take longer.” 

The four Queer Nationals 
from San Francisco were hap¬ 
py to help demonstrate. 
Tanya Tan doc, 21, a student 
who said she was initially in¬ 
volved in the protest in San 
Francisco and was served 
with the production compa¬ 
ny’s first temporary restrain¬ 
ing order there, came down 
after an LA Queer National 
asked for help. 

“We want to be on (Carol¬ 
co’s) butts until this movie 
opens and afterward just to 
let them know how relentless 
we can be,” Tandoc said. 

John Woods, 27, a comput¬ 
er analyst who videotaped the 
demonstration, said, “We’re 
not going to let up simply be¬ 
cause they’re hiding behind 
studio walls.” 

Chris Woods, 24, a journal¬ 
ist from London, was particu¬ 
larly angry with such a “pow¬ 
erful figure” as Michael Dou¬ 
glas being involved with Ba¬ 
sic Instinct just to make a lot 
of money. 

“It seems Hollywood is 
into making queers mad or 
bad or both and that makes 
money for them and it really 
sucks. It makes us dispos¬ 
able,” he said. 

Derek Boyle, 20, said 
“healthy queers” are tired of 
Hollywood’s attack on gays 
and lesbians. “This communi¬ 
ty is under attack politically 
and socially,” he said, “and 
this (film) just feeds into it. 
We feel it’s time we came out 
and raised our voices and let 
people know this isn’t who 
we are.” 

Four more San Francisco 
Queer Nationals, including 
lesbians from LABIA, “road 
tripped” to Los Angeles the 
next day and participated in a 
better attended demonstra¬ 
tion that night at the Univer¬ 
sity of California at Los An¬ 
geles. 

About 20 Queer Nationals 
chanted, carried signs, and 
handed out fliers to a ticket¬ 
buying crowd at a student 
film festival sponsored in part 
by Carolco. One of the stu¬ 
dent films was based on the 
theme Silence * Death. ▼

'In Living Color' 

GLAAD has generally had 
mixed feelings about the 
“Men on ... ” sketches on the 
Fox network’s popular come¬ 
dy/entertainment program In 
Living Color, in which two 
flamboyantly femme, misogy- 
nistic gay male characters, 
played by Damon Wayans 
and David Alan Grier, behave 
in a stereotypical way with 
stereotypical mannerisms. 

On one hand, the charac¬ 


ters are somewhat endearing, 
and their mannerisms (such 
as snapping their fingers in a 
very stylized way) are infec¬ 
tious. 

On the other hand, some 
people feel that in the context 
of TV’s omission of any other 
lesbian and gay characters, 
such blatant stereotypes are 
harmful because they stand 
unchallenged. 

But the “Men on ... ” seg¬ 
ment on the season finale, 
broadcast May 12, was clearly 
defamatory and even danger¬ 
ous. Toward the end of the 
segment, one of the charac¬ 
ters, Antoine, is hit on the 
head with a sandbag and 
knocked unconscious. He 
awakens with his lisp gone, 
insists on being called “Tony,” 
wonders why he has such 
“weird clothes on,” and talks 
about looking for girls. The 
dangerous message is that a 
blow to the head will make 
gays straight! Gay bashing is 
at an all-time high without 
this additional help. 

The “cliffhanger” format of 
the show assured that the sto¬ 
ry will continue in the next 
season. We must prevent the 
violent implications of the 
season’s finale from being ex¬ 
acerbated.

'L.A. Law' 

There was a new develop¬ 
ment in the potentially ro¬ 
mantic relationship between 
C.J. and Abby in the May 2 
episode of L.A. Law. It 
seemed that Abby got 
“dumped” when CJ. told her 
during an intimate dinner at 
home, “First of all, I never 
said I was ready. And you’re 
not ready at all. Ever since 
you’ve arrived, you’ve been 
nervous. You haven’t demon¬ 
strated enough honesty to 
make for a decent friend, let 
alone anything more than 
that. I like you very much, 
but we can’t continue this re¬ 
lationship if you’re trying to 
satisfy your curiosity.” 

What the producers and 
writers have in mind for the 
future of this story line is un¬ 
clear, but in a May 17 inter¬ 
view, actress Amanda Dono- 
hoe (C.J.) told Katherine 
Couric of NBC’s Today Show 
that L.A. Law’s next season 
will not feature story lines that 
focus on her character’s bisex¬ 
uality. Donohoe expressed 
her regret about the change, 
saying that she and Michelle 
Greene (Abby) had been “hav¬ 
ing fun” with the roles. 

Our analysis is that, once 
again, the subject of lesbian¬ 
ism has scared off nervous 
producers who think that rat¬ 
ings will dive, etc. 

Meanwhile, the May 16 
episode of L.A. Law included 
a positive story line in which a 
gay man with AIDS (a recur¬ 
ring, openly gay character) 
won a case against an insur¬ 
ance company which refused 
to pay for his experimental 
treatments and medicine. 

Praise L.A. Law’s produc¬ 
ers for the May 16 episode 
and encourage them strongly 
to develop and expand the ro¬ 
mantic relationship between 
CJ. and Abby. Write to Ex¬

Cairns 

(Continued from page 1) 

talking with people if they’d 
just call and request an ap¬ 
pointment,” said Agnos 
spokesman Art Silverman. 

“We’ll be here until he sees 
us or throws us out,” said 
Peggy Sue, an activist partic¬ 
ipating in the protest. 

Cairns, a 22-year veteran of 
the San Francisco Police De¬ 
partment, was suspended for 
45 days without pay for strik¬ 
ing Bryndis Tobin and J.D. 
Taylor with his baton during 
the Oct. 6, 1989 Castro Street 
ACT UP demonstration. 

Cairns has admitted the 
blows but said they constitut¬ 
ed authorized force during 
police maneuvers. 

The commission also ruled 
that Cairns had Tobin arrest¬ 
ed without reason during the 
incident and failed to report 
the use of force on Taylor. 

Commission Vice Presi¬ 
dent Gwenn Craig dissented 
in the decision to suspend 
Cairns for 45 days. 

Craig, a former deputy 
sheriff and a member of the 
Black Caucus of the Harvey 
Milk Lesbian and Gay Demo¬ 
cratic Club, said Cairns 
should be fired for the mis¬ 
conduct. 

The commission unani¬ 
mously dismissed a charge 
brought by the Office of Citi¬ 
zen Complaints that Cairns 
bludgeoned bystander 
Michael Barnette with his 
club during the incident. 

Barnette, who suffered a 
laceration to his face in the 
blow, told the commission 
last month that Cairns was 
the officer who struck him. 

His testimony was disput¬ 
ed by an account from an'eye¬ 
witness who said he observed 
the entire Oct. 6 melee and 
that a motorcycle officer, not 
Cairns, was the individual 
who caused Barnette’s injury. 

The eyewitness, David 
Lange, also testified that an¬ 
other officer kicked a newspa¬ 
per rack over onto Barnette 
after he fell from the baton 
blow at the corner of 17th 
and Castro. 

Tobin, who suffered carpal 
tunnel injury from the blow 
to her right hand, disputed 
Lange’s testimony. 

“I saw Cairns hit Michael 
Barnette. I know he did it. 
Everything I said was backed 
up by videotape. I’m here be¬ 
cause I feel that any police of¬ 
ficer who is found guilty of 



Crystal Mason

two counts of unauthorized 
force and a count of false ar¬ 
rest should be fired,” she said. 

According to Tobin, the 
protesters targeted the mayor 
because “Agnos appointed the 
Police Commission.” 

“The whole commission 
should resign,” said Crystal 
Mason. “They’re not doing 
their job.” 

According to Mason, Craig 
met with her and other ac¬ 
tivists earlier this spring and 
told them Cairns would be 
fired. 

“That’s not true,” Craig 
said of Mason’s statement. 

Richmond Young, presi¬ 
dent of the Stonewall Gay 
Democratic Club, was present 
at that meeting. What Craig 
said, according to Young, was 
that “she believed there were 
enough votes on the commis¬ 
sion to convict Cairns.” 

Young said the statement 
clearly reflected Craig’s senti¬ 
ment about the charges 
brought by the OCC. 

Cairns’ attorney, Neil 
Eisenberg, unsuccessfully at¬ 
tempted to have Craig dis¬ 
qualified from the commis¬ 
sion hearings after she wrote 
two opinion columns in a lo¬ 
cal gay newspaper regarding 
her views about the Police 
Officers Association and her 
concern that there could be 
another incident similar to 
Oct. 6. 

In a prepared statement 
explaining her dissenting vote 
on Cairns’ suspension, Craig 
said that Cairns had “shown 
himself unfit for command ... 
unfit to wear the uniform of 
this city. 

“By his own account, the 
entire evening of Oct. 6, 1989, 


was a setup. The mistake he 
made was in believing that 
they were only setting up a 
few demonstrators. The truth 
is what was set up was the 
department itself, which was 
discredited, and the constitu¬ 
tional right of people to 
peacefully assemble and 
protest,” Craig said. 

During testimony before 
the commission in fall 1989, 
former Police Chief Frank 
Jordan testified that although 
demonstrators had previously 
been allowed to march in traf¬ 
fic lanes, the police command¬ 
er in charge of crowd con¬ 
trol of the demonstration had 
made a decision to confine 
the demonstrators to the side¬ 
walk. 

The event commander was 
Capt. Robert Fife. 

However, Craig said that 
during the proceedings Cairns 
and another officer had testi¬ 
fied that the decision was 
made by former Deputy Po¬ 
lice Chief Jack Jordan. 

Cairns also testified, Craig 
said, “that the usual orders of 
handling demonstrators were 
clarified in a manner that con¬ 
vinced him that arrests would 
be in order even if the change 
in approach provoked demon¬ 
strators into technical viola¬ 
tions of the law.” 

Craig said that either 
Cairns and the other officer, 
then Lt. John Willits, who is 
now a captain in the depart¬ 
ment, were lying about their 
instructions, or former Chief 
Jordan was lying or didn’t 
“have a clue about what real¬ 
ly happened on Oct. 6 under 
his leadership.” 

Craig said that if the state¬ 
ments made by Cairns and 
Willits were verified, they 
would “constitute a mutual 
conspiracy by officers of the 
department at the highest lev¬ 
el” and a “cover-up” of “delib¬ 
erate provocation of citizens.” 

She also said that the com¬ 
mission planned to thorough¬ 
ly investigate who struck Bar¬ 
nette. 

Craig said that the com¬ 
mission didn’t bring any polit¬ 
ical baggage or prejudice into 
their decision to sustain the 
charges but based those deci¬ 
sions on the preponderance of 
the evidence. 

“None of us consulted with 
the mayor. Nobody was di¬ 
rected by the mayor,” she 
said in response to charges 
that the commission was con¬ 
trolled by Agnos. 

She called charges by Bar¬ 
nette’s attorney that she was 
“a toady” for the mayor 


“ridiculous and cynical.” 

“The vote was clearly or¬ 
chestrated so Gwenn Craig 
could make her prepared re¬ 
marks and seem loyal to the 
lesbian and gay community. I 
don’t care what she is saying, 

I don’t believe it’s sincere,” 
said Walter Parsley, Bar¬ 
nette’s attorney. 

Craig said that she under¬ 
stood Parsley’s frustration 
that things didn’t turn out for 
his client the way he hoped. 

“It’s unfortunate, but I un¬ 
derstand it,” she said. 

“She wasn’t there for us in 
the Smoot case, she wasn’t 
there for us in the Huerta 
case, and she wasn’t there for 
us in this case. That’s three 
strikes and you’re out, 
Gwenn,” said activist Brian 
Bringardner. 

Eisenberg said he would 
appeal Cairns’ suspension to 
Superior Court. 

The Bad Cop-No Donut fo¬ 
cus group announced that the 
City Hall “lie-in” was just one 
of a series of protests planned 
about the commission deci¬ 
sion.

cerning police misconduct 
stemming from the Oct. 6, 
1989 incident that are pending

community, particularly the 
Republicans, who knew Otto 
Bos, the top aide to Gov. Pete 
Wilson who died unexpected¬ 
ly last week, will miss him. 
Gay Republicans knew Bos to 
be fair and supportive on gay 
rights issues. At the GOP state 
convention in 1990, while 
Wilson was running for gover¬ 
nor, Bos shuttled back and 
forth between Christian funda¬ 
mentalists who were rigidly 
anti-gay and gay rights ac¬ 
tivists working out a com¬ 
promise resolution between 
the two warring factions. In the 
end, Bos, a heterosexual, got 
praise from both sides. 

According to items in the 
mainstream press last week, 
Randy Shilts, the author of 
And the Band Played On, a 
book that is about to become 
an HBO docu drama, wants to 
clear up a misconception 
about his book. 

Again, according to com¬ 
ments to the straight press, 
Shilts, one of my favorite 
writers anywhere, says that 
those in the gay community 


who think his book somehow 
asserts that “homosexual pro¬ 
miscuity caused AIDS” are all 
wrong. Incidentally, many gays 
do feel that is the message that 
Shilts was giving in his highly 
successful book. 

“Radical gays did not like 
the book; they felt because Pm 
gay, I should never write one 
word that might be critical of 
another homosexual. But I’m a 
journalist, and if I’m going to 
write a book critical of govern¬ 
ment, scientists, blood banks 
and fundamentalist preachers, 
it would be dishonest not to be 
just as straightforward about 
the failings of gay leaders,” 
Shilts says. 

Shilts is particularly sen¬ 
sitive about his “Patient Zero” 
story in the book and claims 
that it was the press in partic¬ 
ular, the New York Post and 
not himself, that sensational¬ 
ized the story and went on to 
call one airline purser, a man 
from Canada, “The Man Who 
Gave Us AIDS.” 

Shilts insists that his book 
actually says: “No one will ever 
know who brought AIDS to 
America.” 

As if to underline his sensi¬ 
tivity about the issue, Shilts 
has reportedly had it written 
into his contract that the con¬ 
troversial “Patient Zero” tale 
will not be the docudrama’s 
principal story line. 

As AIDS marked its full 
decade last week, Dr. Michael 
Gottlieb, the researcher who 
first reported the disease 10 
years ago, called for political 
leaders to make it “a zero- 
growth epidemic in the next 10 
years.” 

In Washington, Gottlieb pro¬ 
posed a full-time AIDS coor¬ 
dinator in the White House, 
more research support, more 
public education about safe- 
sex techniques. 

Gottlieb rejected more dras¬ 
tic proposals, such as manda¬ 
tory testing of all health care 
workers. Instead, he said, doc¬ 
tors, nurses and others who 
learn they are carrying the 
virus should “defer voluntari¬ 
ly from performing invasive 
procedures.” 

Gottlieb, a medical research¬ 
er from Los Angeles, was co¬ 
author of a brief article that ap¬ 
peared June 5,1981, in a week¬ 
ly bulletin of the federal 
Centers for Disease Control 
that noted that five gay men 
had died of an odd strain of 
pneumonia after their im¬ 
mune systems failed. ▼

Way 

(Continued from page 2) 
bringing the extent of United 
Way’s commitment — both in 
terms of dollars and discrim¬ 
ination — to a head. 

And community leaders 
are intensely interested in 
how the United Way is going 
to deal with both. 

Supervisor Roberta Acht- 
enberg, who will become a 
new United Way board mem¬ 
ber this July, said she expects 
the conflict between the agen¬ 
cy’s policies and the Boy 
Scouts’ anti-gay practices to 
run its course during the com¬ 
ing year. 

“It’s been around for a long 
time,” Achtenberg said. “I 
think it’s coming to a head, 
and I would say over the next 
year I would expect the issue 
to be resolved one way or an¬ 
other.” 

Achtenberg was equally 
sanguine about increased 
United Way funding. 

“The recent recommitment 
to an expanded $250,000 to 
$300,000 this year with a goal 
of $2.5 million during the 
next two or three years is 
clearly goal-setting and that’s 
important. That’s not nothing, 
that’s something.” 

Insider Advocates 

Exactly how the United 
Way is going to deal with its 
rock-and-hard-place dilemma 
with the Scouts has become 
for many activists and com¬ 
munity leaders a kind of lit¬ 
mus test of the charity’s com¬ 
mitment to its own policies. 
And according to United 
Way’s John Stafford the pro¬ 
cess of confronting the issue of 
discrimination in the Scouts 
isn’t going to be a rush job. 

“We just want to make 
sure, when we’re dealing with 
what amounts to a million 
dollars a year for these folks,

to resign and the process 
seems to be under way for 
yet a fourth single male teach¬ 
er, the gay teachers and 
Queer Nation have dubbed 
the forced resignations a 
witch-hunt for homosexuals 
or “suspected” homosexuals. 

According to California 
law, schools do not have to 
give any reason for not hiring 
or rehiring probationary 
teachers. Throughout their 
two-year probation, teachers 
are evaluated periodically by 
an administrator. If a teacher 
receives a negative evalua¬ 
tion, there is a time-limited 
procedure by which the teach¬ 
er can rebut the review. 

All evaluations and rebut¬ 
tals go into a file which be¬ 
comes public at the time of

that we are proceeding in a 
deliberate and fact-finding 
process that doesn’t make as¬ 
sumptions,” Stafford told the 
B.A.R. last week. 

But Stafford said — and les- 
bian/gay leaders involved in 
the controversy generally 
agreed — that the likely out¬ 
come may initially be some 
“amicable solution that leaves 
both parties relatively satis¬ 
fied — if compromised.” 

Suggestions have ranged 
from creating a separate “gay 
Boy Scout troop” to permit¬ 
ting openly gay Scout leaders 
with parental approval to re¬ 
stricting 10 percent of the 
Scouts’ United Way funding 
for dealing with lesbian/gay 
issues and concerns. 

And while some people 
clearly are fighting mad, as 
the rash of canceled pledges 
indicates, perhaps the most 
significant change in the past 
eight years, even if the United 
Way jacks up lesbian/gay 
funding this year substantial¬ 
ly, may well be the generally 


non-adversarial relationship 
between the charity and com¬ 
munity leaders. No one men¬ 
tions pickets; no one is talk¬ 
ing about a boycott. 

The decade or so of work 
activists have put in with the 
United Way has changed the 
community’s relationship 
from outside antagonists to 
inside advocates. 

“It’s no longer the case that 
we have to argue about the 
fact that we are a community 
in need that the United Way 
has not allocated sufficient re¬ 
sources to assist,” Achtenberg 
said. 

“It’s been slow,” she added, 
“and I’m not suggesting that 
we be complacent, because 
the truth is we still have 
much more need and the 
need’s not being met quickly 
enough by this charity or by 
any charity. But there has 
been some significant 
progress. I don’t know what 
else to say: our work is cut 
out for us.” ▼ 


school board. 

If a teacher receives a neg¬ 
ative evaluation, one option is 
to resign before the file gets 
to the board, which then seals 
the file from all eyes, includ¬ 
ing those of future employers. 
Most school boards simply 
rubberstamp the evaluation 
recommendation. 

Both Stewart and Lande- 
feld received good evalua¬ 
tions and rave reviews from 
the principal, parents and stu¬ 
dents before Lipari’s negative 
evaluation. 

However, Stewart refused 
to cover up or lie about his 
homosexuality. If a child 
asked him about his sexual 
orientation, he would ac¬ 
knowledge being gay and an¬ 
swer any questions. 

This provoked a negative 
response from some parents 
who pulled their children out 
of Stewart’s science class. On 
one occasion a parent de¬ 
manded that Stewart appear 
before a school assembly and 
apologize for being gay. Stew¬ 
art refused to do so. 

Stewart and Landefeld 
blame the Burbank Teachers 
Association and the union’s 
then-President Sydney Jer¬ 
maine for giving them bad 
advice on what their options 
were and how to proceed. 

“I was coerced into resign¬ 
ing in February,” Landefeld 
said. “The union said, ‘Dale, 
in 36 hours I want you to sign 
something that says you are 
resigning from the district, 
not just John Muir, but the 
district so that the rest of the 
world won’t see your files.’ 
And I thought, my God, I 
could lose my career because 
of this one bad evaluation by 
one homophobic, fundamen¬ 


talist Christian. There are a 
number of things Sid Jer¬ 
maine should have told me as 
union president that we could 
have gone through. He failed 
to do that. Four of us single 
men over 40 got bad evalua¬ 
tions, and we think there are 
hidden agendas here, covert 
actions.” 

Jermaine disputes the 
charge. 

“No one holds a gun to 
their head People resign of 
their own olition. It is the re- 
sponsibiliiy of the union to 
present ah options to the em¬ 
ployees and allow them to 
make educated decisions,” Jer¬ 
maine said in a phone inter¬ 
view. “I don’t give advice. It’s 
not my responsibility to give 
advice. It is their livelihood 
and their life, and all I can do 
is present the options. If you 
take option A, the union will 
assist you. If you take option 
D, the union will also assist 
you. We also provide free le¬ 
gal assistance.” 

Dr. Aponik, assistant su¬ 
perintendent of Personnel 
Services for the Burbank 
School District, said that, in 
general, once a resignation 
has been tendered and accept¬ 
ed, there is no way to be rein¬ 
stated other than through a 
court order. However, he 
said, the school board makes 
all final determinations on 
school board matters.” 

Newly elected Los Angeles 
Unified School Board mem¬ 
ber Jeff Horton said this 
means that “if it gets political¬ 
ly hot enough, the school 
board could reinstate them.” 

Stewart and Landefeld are 
looking into legal representa¬ 
tion. ▼

took precedent over the com¬ 
petitive nature of the awards 
ceremony itself. 

Of course, the trip also had 
some low moments for me. 
Like when a good friend and 
former lover told me, over 
the one dinner she’d allotted 
me, that I’m a dyke role mod¬ 
el, HER role model, and I 
should therefore watch what I 
write — especially on topics 
like bisexuality — so that I 
don’t confuse or alienate peo¬ 
ple. I ponder just whom it is 
that’s actually confused, and 
vow aloud never to self-cen¬ 
sor what I write, feeling sad 
that she wants me to fit into a 
narrowly defined category 
that I don’t believe in any¬ 
more for myself. 

Then there is the mo¬ 
ment, when in a small flurry 
of bitterness, I am forced to 
contend with woman-only 
space gone wild when I, along 
with other female A Different 
Light and Lambda Rising 
Bookstore employees, am 
haughtily excluded from a 
lesbian-feminist booksellers 
networking dinner because 
we work for a male-owned — 
albeit queer — company. In 
protest, I do not talk to many 
of the feminist press represen¬ 
tatives at the ABA, visibly 
camping out instead at Sasha 
Alyson’s booth, where I feel 
more at home in this sup¬ 
posed “safe sea” of lesbian 
literati. 

And the true irony of how 
far I’ve come hits me when 
an old straight friend from 
high school and I meet for 
lunch. Over sushi, this wom¬ 
an, who bravely slept with 
women before I dared to my¬ 
self, could barely look at the 
copy of my ’zine, CUNT, 
which I’d brought to show 
her. We agrefe that she’s got¬ 
ten more conservative as I’ve 
become more radical, and 
have a halting discussion on 
the right of women to have 
repeated abortions. After she 
asks why lesbians work on re¬ 
productive rights issues and 
questions the necessity for all 
women to have abortion on 
demand, the subject ends 
abruptly when I remind her 
of the several close calls and 
morning after pills I suffered 
through with her in our teen¬ 
age years. 

“You’re right,” she says, 
before we switch the topic. “I 
guess I was one of the lucky 
ones.” 

Small revelations aside, 
my final days in New York 
are both incredibly hectic and 
incredibly queer. Vickie and I 
attend a rooftop party in the 
Village, drink beer, and 
schmooze with some activist 
boys as the sun sets gloriously 
behind the Manhattan sky¬ 
line, the stars peeking out for 
a rare downtown appearance. 
We take in an ACT UP Lati¬ 
na/Latino Caucus dance bene¬ 
fit, crash a loft art party, and 
cruise the Clit Club three 
nights in a row, where the 
crowd ranges from a low-key 
Thursday night benefit for 
WHAM!, a direct action wom¬ 
en’s health organization, to 
the pierced and shaved Satur¬ 
day night set. 

The Clit Club is notorious 
in New York, like Club “Q” is 
here, for its diverse but gener¬ 
ally all around cool clientele. 
But unlike its West Coast 
counterparts, the Clit Club is 
also famous for the practice 
of shirt-shedding when things 
start to heat up on the dance 
floor. And ever quick to fol¬ 
low the local customs out on 
the trail in our Amazon Na¬ 
tion, I of course followed suit. 


And let me tell you, sisters 
of mine, there’s no greater 
thrill than stripping down to 
next to nothing and dancing 
to Madonna while surround¬ 
ed by sexy dykes whose bod¬ 
ies, like your own, are glisten¬ 
ing with sweat in the semi¬ 
darkness. 

On the plane back to San 
Francisco, I’m trapped in a 
window seat next to a 60ish 
straight couple. I zone out 
with my Walkman till it’s 
time to take off the tape that’s 
been playing round for about 
two hours. As I fumble in my 
bag for “Blue Bell Knoll,” the 
woman seizes the opportunity 
for conversation, asking me 
where I’m from and what I 
do. I take the plunge and tell 
her I work at a gay and les¬ 
bian bookstore and write for 
the queer press. She sizes me 
up real quickly over the top 
of her glasses and without 
missing a beat asks, rather 
breathlessly, “And are you 
one?” 

By the time the plane 
lands some time later, I have 
heard about her childhood 
crush on a famous suffragette, 
her Bryn Mawr daughter (uh- 
huh!), how her gay male 
friends were persecuted dur¬ 
ing the McCarthy years, and 
given her advice on how to 


Unsafe Sex, Heterosexual Style 


by Keith Clark 

A newlywed couple in 
Aranjuez, Spain, were both 
slightly injured recently when 
a penile implant the groom 
had had surgically inserted 
six months before getting 
married burst while the cou¬ 
ple were having sex on their 
honeymoon. 

Carlos Ramirez, 47, and his 
new bride, Francesca Laz, 
both suffered minor genital 
and groin injuries after 
Ramirez’s penile implant rup¬ 
tured suddenly under built-up 
pressure while the couple 
were consummating their 
nuptials. 

Ramirez, who was left sex¬ 


ually impotent following a 
groin injury four years ago, 
had a penile implant opera¬ 
tion six months ago after he 
and Laz decided to get mar¬ 
ried. 

The implant, which al¬ 
lowed Ramirez to simulate 
orgasm by sending seminal 
fluids through tubes when the 
base of the implant is 
squeezed, was nearly an inch 
too long and slowly became 
bent. 

Ramirez had avoided hav¬ 
ing a new implant operation 
to correct the problem be¬ 
cause of the expense — nearly 
$5,000 — but went ahead with 
the wedding anyway, promis¬ 
ing his surgeon not to have 


sex before having a new im¬ 
plant operation. 

Overcome with passion on 
their honeymoon, however, 
the couple decided to chance 
it, and when Ramirez 
squeezed the base of the im¬ 
plant to consummate, fluid 
built up where it had bent 
and the implant burst. 

Ramirez suffered lacera¬ 
tions and contusions of the 
penis and testes and was hos¬ 
pitalized. His wife suffered 
only minor lacerations. 

As soon as Ramirez’s in¬ 
juries are better, doctors plan 
to perform a new implant op¬ 
eration that they hope will 
make sex for the couple less 
hazardous. ▼ 


gently encourage her friend 
of 40 years, whom she sus¬ 
pects may be gay, to come 
out to her. I’m also, she tells 
me, the first out lesbian she’s 
ever met. I chalk one up for 
dyke visibility and head off 
the plane for home, Cocteau 
Twins buzzing in my ears, 
New York gal-pals swirling 
through my brain, and al¬ 
ready plotting my next adven¬ 
ture. ▼

Out in 
The Open 

Lesbian Sexuality Is More Visible - 
But Have We Thought About 
What We Really Want? 



by Nancy Boutilier 

A rose may be a rose by 
any other name, but a 
bar’s name may help 
measure the growing 
visibility of lesbian sexuality, 
sexuality. 

The women’s bar I fre¬ 
quented during the ’80s was 
Boston’s Somewhere Else. 
The name allowed a closeted 
dyke to avoid embarrassment 
when asked where she was 
going. It provided a built-in 
code word to help lesbians 
identify one another. I often 
wondered how the men could 
be discreet when trying to 
suggest a rendezvous at The 
Ram Rod. 

When Somewhere Else 
burned down, someone else 
opened a women’s bar named 
Secrets. Women protested the 
built-in homophobia of the 
name, and it was renamed In¬ 
digo — a solid woman-identi¬ 
fied name, hinting of femi¬ 
nism with a leaning toward 
New Age gentleness. 

Lately, in San Francisco, 
the marketing of bars equates 
lesbian pride and outness 
with visible lesbian sexuality. 
“It’s new, it’s nasty, it’s Faster 


Escape 

From 

Peyton 

Place 

Sam Harris Finds 
Happiness on the 
Other Side of 
The Rainbow 

by Wendell Ricketts 

T he story of singer 
Sam Harris’ child¬ 
hood and youth is one 
that many of us al¬ 
ready know by heart. Lonely 
and suffocating in his tiny Ok¬ 
lahoma hometown — an exis¬ 
tence he describes as a “night¬ 
mare” — Harris longed for a 
way out. The “ Peyton Place 
mentality,” he felt, was whit¬ 
tling away at his very soul. 
But luckily for Harris — 


Pussycat!” How much bolder 
it feels venturing into Snatch 
on a Saturday night than 
sidling up to the bar at 
Francine’s used to feel! 

Amelia’s and Cafe San 
Marcos seem so tame com¬ 
pared to Club Q’s Bra Night 
and Girl Spot’s nickname, 
The G-Spot. 

The language and look of 
lesbian sexuality is cropping 
up in a variety of new places. 
Although Good Vibrations 
and Joan Nestle have been 
out there helping to stimulate 
and liberate lesbians for 
years, the emergence of our 
sexuality postered in the Cas¬ 
tro and depicted in the main¬ 
stream gay press is new. 

Traditionally, gay media 
have made gay male sexuality 
highly visible. Although refer¬ 
ences to and images of male 
sexuality continue to outnum¬ 
ber allusions to lesbian sexu¬ 
ality in gay public discourse, 
we’re gaining on them. Equal¬ 
ity may be around the corner. 

Lesbian Liberation 

But wait! Is equality what 
we want to strive for? Isn’t 
liberation a more revolution¬ 
ary goal? It seems to me that 


and for the audiences that 
come to hear him sing today 
— he made the discovery of a 
lifetime: the movies, theatre 
and the great hurting songs of 
legends like Billie Holiday, 
Aretha Franklin, Jackie Wil¬ 
son and Judy Garland. “I sup¬ 
pose the blessing of growing 


lesbian liberation is the inde¬ 
pendence to create our own 
set of values. Equality, which 
seems to be where we are 
headed, is the state of having 
what the guys — gay and 
straight — have. 

I came-of-age reading Ms. 
magazine and recognizing 
that pornography often ex¬ 
ploits women. Pornography 
often yolks straight women 
with painful and unrealistic 
norms of sexual dynamics. 
Pseudo-lesbianism in porn, 
though titillating for straight 
men, trivializes our love for 


up (the way I did),” Harris 
says, “is that I found out at an 
early age what I really loved 
to do — and what was going to 
be my escape.” He laughs, “It 
was so cathartic for me to 
start singing like all those 
emotional singers. There was 
just all that misery wrapped 

Second of Two Sections 


one another and overlooks 
the fullness of our sexual sat¬ 
isfaction with one another. 

What all of this boils down 
to is the notion of a lesbian 
sensibility. It has been easy 
for me to relate to Georgia 
O’Keefe’s work as being 
woman-identified. Alison 
Bechdel’s “Dykes To Watch 
Out For” struggle through

JL explodes like a 
time bomb into dark comedic 
genius. Ken Siman is an ex¬ 
citing new voice in American 
fiction. I found this book 
painful and hilarious, often on 
the same page,” adds Susan 
Brownmiller. “A new literary 
lion,” proclaimed a Christo¬ 
pher Street cover story. 

A lion? In person, Ken 
Siman is more like Dorothy’s 
Scarecrow as played by James 
Stewart. He’s tall and gangly, 
with a strikingly muscular 
torso that doesn’t know what 
to do with itself. Siman, who 
is publicity director of Grove 
Weidenfeld — helping to pro¬ 
mote such authors as Hugh 
Selby Jr., Dennis Cooper, 
John Rechy and the Marquis 
de Sade — is a quirky mixture 
of self-effacement and strong 
opinions. 

Siman’s first novel, Pizza 
Face, which so far has been 
universally praised, is a hilar¬ 
ious, yet heart-rending ac¬ 
count of Andy, a boy growing 
up with acne in Charlotte, 
North Carolina, who suddenly 
discovers he’s gay. With this 
revelation, Andy loses his in¬ 
terest in Jimmy Carter mem¬ 
orabilia and starts fantasizing 
about the same sex: 

He once heard a story about 
a pizza delivery boy who 
was bringing a big order to 
the football players’ dorm. 

A bunch of the hunks tied 
him up, busted his belt, and 
ate all his pizzas, without 
paying him or giving him a 
tip. Andy wondered where 
the pizza boy was; he want¬ 
ed to know what it felt like. 

From some collegiate het¬ 
erosexual exploration, to cop¬ 
ulating with his dream boy, to 
gay orgies in Washington, 
D.C, Pizza Boy perfectly de¬ 
picts what it is like to grow 
up and not fit into white soci¬ 
ety, gay or straight. Siman 
visits the Bay Area June 20 
(he’ll be reading at Cody’s at 
8 p.m.). Below, he talks about 
his book, and the whole con¬ 
cept of “beauty.”

B.A.R.: So how autobio¬

Ken Siman: Not every¬ 
thing in that book happened, 
of course, but it might as well 
have, you know. The pursuit 
of beauty is something that 
I’m completely obsessed by, 
and I don’t know how to get 
over it. I don’t think everyone 
is obsessed with it as I am,

GAY AND FUNNY TIDBITS FROM AROUND THE WORLD 


by Daniel Mangin and Kevin Davis 


HARVEY PLAYS GAY 
(AGAIN): UPI’s Joan 
Hanauer reports that “ABC 
and PBS are getting together 
in a first-time collaboration 
to present a drama aimed at 
preventing the spread of the 
disease among teenagers.” In 
The Shadow of Love: A 
Teen AIDS Story will air 
Sept. 18 on PBS and the 
next day will be presented as 
an “ABC Afterschool Spe¬ 
cial.” The story revolves 
around two girls who work 
together on a school project 
involving a support group for 
kids who have tested HIV 
positive, thereby learning 
about the AIDS epidemic. 
Harvey Fierstein plays a gay 
high school counselor. Ac¬ 
cording to the show’s execu¬ 
tive producer, Judy Stoia, 
“We felt it was very impor¬ 
tant to have someone of Har¬ 
vey’s stature to play a role in 
this. This is a drama aimed 
at young people and Hispan¬ 
ic and black kids, but there 
is no question that the epi¬ 
demic has played a profound 
and devastating effect on the 
part of the American public 
that is gay men. I felt very 
strongly that we needed to 
have in our cast a highly re¬ 
garded gay actor and, in this

of the first people to sign up. 

I don’t know the man, but he 
called up and said, ‘I’ll do 
whatever you need me to 
do.’ ” 

WORKING COMPAN¬ 
IONS: Craig Lucas and Nor¬ 
man Rene, writer and direc¬ 
tor, respectively, of Long¬ 
time Companion, have just 
started filming (for Twenti¬ 
eth Century Fox) the screen 
version of Lucas’ Broadway 
hit, Prelude to a Kiss. The 
play, which is about a young 
man who discovers on his 
body has switched souls with 
that of a crotchety old man 
(played by Sidney Walker, 
who was in the role in the 
pre-Broadway Berkeley Rep 
production), stars Alec Bald¬ 
win, Meg Ryan, Kathy Bates, 
Patty Duke and Ned Beatty. 

MARTINA UPDATE: 

Maybe those tabloids aren’t 
all BS after all. OUT 
THERE previously reported 
on a Daily Mirror (London) 
story about a soon-to-be-filed 
palimony suit against Marti¬ 
na Navratilova. Her ex-part¬ 
ner Judy Nelson finally filed 
the suit in Texas June 7. Ac¬ 
cording to wire reports, Nel¬ 
son has videotape of her and 
Martina going over a cohabi¬ 
tation agreement line-by-line. 
Suit asks for half of the as¬ 
sets Martina acquired during 
the partnership but no ongo¬ 
ing support. 

CORPORAL PUNISH¬ 
MENT CLUB RAIDED: 
Mark Finch adamantly de¬ 
nies that there’s any truth to 
the rumor that he was round¬ 
ed up in the raid by Notting¬ 
ham police of a gay corporal 
punishment club earlier this 


spring, an event that was re¬ 
ported, though not con¬ 
firmed, in London’s Gay 
Times June issue. (“If con¬ 
firmed, the prosecution is 
certain to add to the contro¬ 
versy which surrounded the 
jailing last December of 
eight gay and bisexual men 
for consensual sado¬ 
masochistic activity,” the 
magazine reported.) OUT 
THERE had heard from vis¬ 
iting San Franciscans that 
Finch’s cheeks were especial¬ 
ly rosy last April, but appar¬ 
ently the folks weren’t talk¬ 
ing about the relevant ones. 
Sorry, Mark, but it did sound 
so y-o-u. 

SANDRA GOES FOR 
HOT BITCHES: Paul Fran 
cis reports June 4 in the high¬ 
ly reputable Globe that San¬ 
dra Bernhard and Amanda 
Donohoe held hands at a re¬ 
cent movie premiere. Sandra 
is quoted as saying, “Amanda 



Sandra goes for the hot 
bitches. 

is the hottest bitch on TV. I 
have to be where the hottest 
bitches are.” The article con¬ 
tinues, “Another source who 
saw the cozy couple said, 
‘Sandra was hanging onto 
Amanda. She had her arm 
around her and was flirting 
outrageously.” Concluded 
Francis, “The coosome two¬ 
some left astonished onlook¬ 
ers whispering, ‘Are they 
gay?’ ” 


PICKY, PICKY: The 
British Daily Mirror report¬ 
ed June 4, “A Beauty Queen 
has been stripped of the title 
because she is a man. Leggy 
blonde Michelle-Michael Di¬ 
eter, 20, was only caught out 
when ‘she’ danced with a 
man after the event in 
Bayreuth, Germany.” 


MALE SEXPLOITA¬ 
TION: Laurie Pike writes 
in Us June 27, “The future of 
music video sexploitation is 
male N&R, as in nipples and 
ripples. ... Videos have now 
become equal opportunity 
ogle-fests by thrusting men’s 
oversize pecs and washboard 
abs into the limelight.” Di¬ 
rector Lionel Martin says, 

“Not only is Freedom 
(Williams, of C&C Music 
Factory) appealing to wom¬ 
en, but also to male homo¬ 
sexuals who are a big market 
for this kind of music.” Jim 
Czarnecki, who has produced 
videos for U2, Talking 
Heads, and the B-52s, says, 
“It’s not a fringe or gay thing 
anymore. Herb Ritts makes a 
Janet Jackson video, and all 
of a sudden every 25-year-old 
homophobic video director 
decides they’ve got to have 
some cute guys with their 
shirts off.” 

BEWARE THE EVIL 
GAYRAGS: The summer 
Bimbox warns, “Magazines 
like the Advocate and 
OUT/LOOK have but one man¬ 
date: to systematically render 
the entire international Les¬ 
bian and Gay population 
brain-dead. And sadly, their 
evil task has been remark¬ 
ably successful, but with a 
few pockets of clone-immune 
individuals scattered across 
the planet. Only a handful of 
small ‘alternative’ publica¬ 
tions stand in the way of the 
complete lobotomization of 
our culture. Bimbox is 
one of those publications.” 

SCAB MANIFESTO: 
The members of SCAB (Soci¬ 
ety for the Complete Annihi¬ 
lation of Breeding) outlined 
their goals recently. These 
include “the absolute obliter¬ 
ation of what is generally re¬ 
garded as the American nu¬ 
clear family. Our method? 
Violence, pornography, abor¬ 
tions, castration, mindless 
sex, mass murder and the 
widespread destruction of 
private and state property. ... 
Heterosexuality is an inte¬ 
gral part of the nuclear fami¬ 
ly, the destruction of which 
is essential for a breeder-free 
world. ... No one has the 
right to have kids.” Rather 
visionary when you think 
about it. Could end all of the 
world’s (present) problems in 
just under a century! ▼

Film Fest 


Series Explores Lesbianism, Catholicism 

Sister, Woman, Sister 



by Deborah Peifer 

T he most important 
lesson I learned from 
my experience grow¬ 
ing up Catholic is 
how to kneel for long periods 
of time moving only my 
tongue. Well, maybe not the 
most important, but certainly 
the one that makes me such a 
hit at parties. 

I don’t think that 
“Catholic” ever really goes 
away. Sure, you can stop go¬ 
ing to Mass, renounce the evil 
O’Connor and all his works, 
decide that worshipping a 
male god does not connect to 
your lesbian feminism and 
sneer at the sheep who still 
follow the party line, but in a 
moment of crisis what comes 
out of your mouth is “Holy 
Mary, Mother of God.” 

A T-shirt of mine says that 
I survived Catholic school. I 
have friends who refer to 
themselves as recovering 
Catholics. The impact of the 
Church (and believe me, 
when you’re Catholic there is 
only one church that counts) 
on my way of interacting in 
the world continues to this 
day. I do not respect his 
teaching authority, and I 
think he’s a silly bigot in a 
dress, but if there is an article 
in the news about the pope, 
I’ve already read it before I 
remember that I don’t care. 

Lasting Impression 

Most important, I suspect, 
in terms of their lasting im¬ 
pression on both my lesbian 
mind and my lesbian body, 
were and are the nuns. I went 
to Catholic school before the 
advent of Sister Judy who 
lives in her own apartment 
and who wears a pair of 
sweats for a habit. My nuns 


had names like Sister Mary 
Sorrowing Heart of Jesus, 
wore full drag and knew the 
efficacy of a well-placed right 
hook. They were mysterious, 
other-worldly creatures, who 
might or might not have hair 
(or legs), but who certainly 
had authority. 

The lesson that I was 
taught everyday, at my all¬ 
girl Catholic high school, the 
lesson I remembered long af¬ 
ter geometry had disappeared 
into a defective synapse, was 
that if something had to be 
done, a woman could do it. In 
the single-sex world of my 
high school, women were in 
charge, and there was no such 
thing as “that’s too hard for 
girls to do.” I grew up with 
women mathematicians and 
women chemists and women 
administrators (and, of course, 
women gym teachers) and 
never considered that there 
might be something I wanted 
to do that the mere fact of my 
being female prevented me 
from doing. If that isn’t dyke 
basic training, I don’t know 
what is. 

Annette Forster explores 
the Catholic-lesbian connec¬ 
tion in a series of screenings 
at the San Francisco Interna¬ 
tional Gay and Lesbian 
Film Festival, “Catholic 
Iconography in Lesbian Cine¬ 
ma.” Forster’s interest is in 
“the icons of Catholicism, and 
the rites and imagery repre¬ 
sented in films and videos 
made by lesbians today.” She 
has selected eight 
films/videos, not all of which 
were available for advanced 
screening. Judging by those 
that were, the idea for the 
program unfortunately ap¬ 
pears to be considerably more 
interesting than its execution. 


Nuns From Inside, Out 

There is a big difference 
between a woman in a nun 
suit, and a nun, just as there 
is an enormous difference be¬ 
tween what a nun looks like 
to an outsider, and what she 
is to an insider. The nuns in 
Damned If You Don’t and 
The Nun look like what peo¬ 
ple who don’t know about 
nuns think convent life, and 
nun stuff in general, is. 

The Nun is a French film 
from 1966, directed by 
Jacques Rivette, about corrup¬ 
tion and decadence in 18th- 
century French convents. At 
least, that is what it’s sup¬ 
posed to be. But I never got 
a sense of either 18th-century 
or convent in this piece. 
There are lots of mistakes, 
having to do with who would 
be where, when, in the clois¬ 
ter, as well as a modernity of 
movement styles and lan¬ 
guage choices that was first 
distracting, but soon annoy¬ 
ing. 

Axe to Grind 

Rivette has a serious anti- 
Catholic axe to grind, and I 
don’t have a problem with 
that; so do I. But I do have a 
problem with scenes that last 


forever, devoid of movement 
or character or style. The act¬ 
ing is uniformly (habitually?) 
not good; I had trouble telling 
the characters apart, or re¬ 
membering who they were 
from one scene to the next. 
The violence is unmotivated, 
and springs more from the 
aforementioned axe than any 
character or textual choice. 

In Su Friedrich’s Damned 
If You Don’t, interspersed 
with nun images from art and 
film, are scenes of a woman 
following a nun. Eventually, 
the nun follows the woman 
home, and they have sex. But 
sex with a woman in a nun 
suit is not really about appro¬ 
priating the mysteries or liv¬ 
ing the fantasy, and I never 
had any sense that this char¬ 
acter was anything more than 
a woman in a habit. 

Along with Damned If 
You Don’t — in a program ti¬ 
tled “Damned If You Do” — 
are Evolution of a Sex Life, 
Cindy Gaffney’s wry look at 
the connections, not always 
unhappy ones, of Catholicism 
to her sex life; Suzie Silver 
and Laurence Steger’s Pecca- 
tum Mutum, a video piece 
about lesbian desire in the 
cloister the details of which 
again reveal a less than com¬ 


plete understanding of con¬ 
vent life; and Christine Va- 
chon’s The Way of the 
Wicked. John Ford’s 1965 
Seven Women (his last film), 
in which, the festival’s pro¬ 
gram describes, “lesbian at¬ 
traction intrudes on a group 
of American missionary wom¬ 
en isolated in China, Elfi 
Mikesch’s Hyena’s Breakfast 
and Friedrich’s earlier work, 
Gently Down the Stream, 
the latter about the filmmak¬ 
er’s coming to terms with her 
Catholicism, round out 
Forster’s series. 

Before considering the ef¬ 
fect of Catholicism on les¬ 
bians, it seems to me, Forster 
needs to consider just what 
those icons of Catholicism re¬ 
ally are, and not just what 
they look like, but how they 
feel in our lesbian bodies. 
There are good nun films, 
films that capture the interior 
life, if you will. The Nun’s 
Story is a fine example, and 
believe me, Audrey Hepburn 
is one of the great embodi¬ 
ments of nun, of the fantasy 
of nun, of what we dreamed 
about when we dreamed 
about Sister Mary Faith Hope 
and Charity, that I’ve ever 
seen. The iconography of the 
nun, and especially of the 
Catholic girl’s response to 
that icon, is the real subject of 
a not bad film, The Trouble 
With Angels, with Rosalind 
Russell as Mother Superior, 
and Hayley Mills as the 
school girl. 

There is a lot that needs to 
be said about the place of 
Catholicism in the lives of les¬ 
bians. There’s sense to be 
made of what those images 
meant, and what they may 
mean to us in the future. I 
grew up with a community of 
women: strong, independent, 
capable, loving. The reality of 
that community enables me 
to believe in the strength of 
the lesbian communities I in-

Out/Look Opens 
A Can of Worms 

by Kate Bornstein 


W ill You Engage in 
Debate? asks the 
brochure for Ho- 
moSocial, a series of panel de¬ 
bates this June and July, spon¬ 
sored by the Out/Look Foun¬ 
dation in San Francisco, 
which publishes Out/Look 
magazine and sponsors the 
annual Out/Write conference. 

“We want to continue 
building off the momentum 
from Out/Write ’91,” the foun¬ 
dation’s development direc¬ 
tor, David Lindsay, said re¬ 
cently. “We want to bring the 
forum of the magazine into a 
live situation so that we can 
provide the opportunity for 
live, public dialogue.” 

About what? Lesbians and 
gay men in the military (“Our 
Right to Serve?”; June 13), the 
impact of lesbian and gay sex¬ 
uality on the world at large 
(“Homosex Rules!”; June 27) 
and the can of worms called 
“the gay community” and its 
inclusion or exclusion of var¬ 
ious other minority cultures 
(“Who is ‘We’?”; July 18). Each 
of the panels will consist of 
writers and other activists — 
among them Perry Watkins, 
Kate Dyer, Dorothy Allison, 
Thomas Almaguer, Susie 



David Lindsay 


Bright, Brian Freeman, Jackie 
Goldsbie and Zoon Nguyen — 
who are deeply committed to 
differing sides of these issues. 
Discussion periods will allow 
for audience input to the de¬ 
bate. 

“The forum is not neces¬ 
sarily about magically becom¬ 
ing a united community,” ad¬ 
mits Lindsay. “It’s more about 
getting to a point where we’ll 
be able to understand one an¬ 
other as diverse groups.”

Spike Lee's at His Best With Jungle Fever' 

Provocateur Extraordinaire 


by Karl Bruce Knapper 

S pike Lee’s ego, pen¬ 
chant for hype and 
braggadocio, and the 
obvious shortcomings 
of some of his movies (shal¬ 
low characterizations, sexism, 
occasional homophobia/het¬ 
erosexism) often overshadow 
his works’ most important at¬ 
tribute: they make you think. 
As a filmmaker, Spike Lee is 
a provocateur extraordinaire, 
and Jungle Fever, his latest, 
is his best yet. 

From the imaginative 
opening sequence, where the 
credits float by on street signs 
set against stills of New York 
City (giving you much more 
info than simply the actors’ 
names), to the melancholy 
closing credits (both of which 
are accompanied by the most 
creative music Stevie Wonder 
has written in years), Lee 
skillfully seduces you with his 
portrait of an America in the 
throes of racial turmoil. He ef¬ 
fortlessly synthesizes many of 
the themes and techniques 
that he has obviously been 
working on in his earlier 
movies into a nearly seamless 
and beautiful masterpiece. 

The basic premise of the 
movie involves an interracial 
relationship between Flipper 
Purify (Wesley Snipes), an 
African-American man from 
Harlem, and Angie Tucci 
(AnnabellaSciorra), an Italian- 
American woman from Ben- 
sonhurst, but this film is 
about so much more than just 
two people who are attracted 
to each other due to sexual 
mythology rather than gen¬ 
uine affection. In fact, Jungle 
Fever neither condones nor 
condemns interracial relation¬ 
ships, nor does it try to de¬ 
bunk the sexual/social myths 
on which some of these rela¬ 
tionships are founded. 

Leaving Us to Decide 

Lee instead puts the idea 
of interracial relationships out 


Spike Lee 


there and leaves it to us to de¬ 
cide what we think about 
them and why. Some will say 
that he stacks the deck 
against the central interracial 
relationship, though those 
who have been in one will be 
able to identify with much of 
what happens. And there is a 
second interracial relationship 
that develops and will proba¬ 
bly survive the societal pres¬ 
sures against it because the 
couple involved are attracted 
to each other for better rea¬ 
sons than sexual curiosity. 

Lee also uses the central 
interracial relationship as a 
stepping-off point to explore 
the mythology of race, sex 
and class that pervades an 
America where we are finally 
and tragically reaping the har¬ 
vest of centuries of racial 
hypocrisy. In addition to ex¬ 
amining interracial relation¬ 
ships, Jungle Fever also deals 
with issues like drugs, 
color/class problems in the 
black community, multiracial 
heritages, and the oppression 
and false succor of religion. 

A lesser director would 
have been overwhelmed by 
such an oversized palette of 
ideas, but Lee successfully 
carries it off because he 
doesn’t try to bring every¬ 
thing to some neat Hollywood 
resolution. This movie is ulti¬ 
mately a portrait of modern- 


day urban American life, and 
life today is not full of nice 
packages and clean resolu¬ 
tions — it is a sloppy, chaotic 
mess. When this film is over, 
you leave the theatre wonder¬ 
ing how most of us ever 
make it to adulthood and 
manage to survive such a bru¬ 
tally messed-up world. 

Jungle Fever is actually 
very funny, but it is the kind 
of humor that comes out of 
pain, laughter in the face of 
oppression and heartache, or 
the tears of a clown. One 
minute you’re laughing and 
the next your laughter’s stuck 
in your throat by the harsh, 
cold unpleasantness of reality. 
The film effortlessly switches 
gears from humor to sadness 
to anger and back again with¬ 
out skipping a beat or confus¬ 
ing the viewer. 

Excellent Acting 

The acting throughout is 
excellent. Snipes and Sciorra 
expertly portray characters 
whose lives are turned up¬ 
side-down by their attraction 
for each other, and Sciorra in 
particular manages to bring 
some real depth and strength 
to her character’s confusion 
and uncertainty. Lonette McKee 
is brilliant in her role as Flip¬ 
per’s proud, intelligent wife 
who refuses to be a scorned 
and helpless woman. Lee is 
good as Flipper’s best friend 
Cyrus — it’s the most relaxed 
and laid-back he’s ever been 
in a role. 

Special mention must be 
made of Samuel L. Jackson, 
Flipper’s crack-addicted 
brother Gator. He manages to 
bring a harrowing poignancy 
and profundity to his role and 
easily stands out in a uniform¬ 
ly sterling supporting cast. 
Tim Robbins and Brad Dou- 
rif shine in their throwaway 
roles as Flipper’s obtuse and 
insensitive bosses as do 
Queen Latifah as a confronta¬ 
tional waitress in a soul-food

Marlon Talks About 
What Makes Him Tick 


by Karl Bruce Knapper 

M arlon Riggs is the 
Emmy award¬ 
winning produc¬ 
er/director of 
films such as Ethnic Notions, 
Tongues Untied, Long Train 
Running, Affirmations, An¬ 
them and the forthcoming 
Color Adjustment, works 
which have helped to break 
the silence surrounding the 
African-American experience. 
For those who would like to 
know more about this artist 
and what makes him tick 
there is the upcoming KQED 
show, The Creative Mind. 

In this two-part interview 
with Bettina Gray, Riggs can¬ 
didly talks about his life and 
his art, demonstrating why he 
is one of the foremost docu¬ 
mentary filmmakers of the 
black experience in America. 
Ethnic Notions, for which he 
won an Emmy, examined 
stereotypical representations 
of blacks and showed the 
damage that these images 
have done and still do to, not 
only African Americans, but 
all people who have con¬ 
sciously and unconsciously di¬ 
gested them. Tongues Untied 
explored and exploded the si¬ 
lence cloaking what it means 
to be a black gay man, and 
gave — those of us who didn’t 
know we had one — a voice. 

Riggs’ films touch people 
outside the communities that 
he originally makes them for 
because in exploring the per¬ 
sonal in such a frank and hon¬ 
est manner, his work con¬ 
nects with the universal as¬ 
pects of the human condition. 

In the Creative Mind in¬ 
terviews, Riggs explains how 
he came to video/film as a 
practical way to communicate 
what he was learning at Har¬ 
vard to people who would 
probably never attend an Ivy 
League college or read a book 
of critical theory. He speaks 
of the initial difficulty he ex¬ 
perienced when he first got 
out of school and found that 
people were threatened and 
intimidated by his being a 
well-educated black man. 

So he applied to Berke¬ 
ley’s graduate program in 
journalism, which allowed 
him to produce a documen¬ 
tary for his master’s thesis, 
and thus began his journey as 
a documentary filmmaker. 

He talks about his rejec¬ 
tion of the so-called objective 
and professional approach to 
making documentaries in fa¬ 
vor of a more impassioned 
and heartfelt one, which he 
feels makes it possible for his 


work to communicate to peo¬ 
ple outside his intended audi¬ 
ences. Thus people can con¬ 
nect with the solitude and 
fragmentation expressed in a 
film like Tongues Untied be¬ 
cause these are experiences 
that transcend race and sexu¬ 
ality. 

He also explains exactly 
what he meant when he used 
the phrase, “Black men loving 
Black men is a revolutionary 
act,” in Tongues Untied, a 
comment which caused much 
controversy among those who 
did not understand what he 
was trying to say. 

Reconciling With Death 

In this wide-ranging talk, 
Riggs also gives us a glimpse 
at the vision that motivates 
him to create. He talks of 
how it has become important 
to him to reconcile himself 
with death through his work, 
and that instead of running 
away from or trying to undo 
death, he plans to live beyond 
death through his work be¬ 
cause it is a way that he can 
continue to move people and 
show them that life is worth 
living and that humanity can 
be virtuous. 

Riggs feels that politically 
engaged artists are trying to 
affirm not only their own hu¬ 
manity, particularly if they 
come from traditionally disen¬ 
franchised and oppressed 
groups, but the humanity of 
all people. He believes that 
we are facing the dawning of 
a new age, whether we want 
to admit it or not, and that we 
all need to work to challenge 
the status quo and reconcile 
ourselves with each other as 
well as ourselves, instead of 
constantly privileging one 
kind of difference over anoth¬ 
er. This way we can begin to 
create a world in which we 
can start to integrate our¬ 
selves with each other as a 
global people. 

He also talks about the in¬ 
terconnectedness of all people 
and says that it is not neces¬ 
sary to carve out our own 
identities at the expense or 
the denial of the identity of 
others. He says that we all 
need to learn to accept and 
love who and what we are, 
and deal with the pain and 
shame that is often connected 
with being different. 

Anyone who admires Mar¬ 
lon Riggs and the work that 
he has created should check 
out The Creative Mind (part 
one airs June 19, 7:30 p.m.; 
part two airs June 26, 7:30 
p.m.). ▼

Dance 


Val Caniparoli Makes a New Dance for SF Ballet 

Mozart for Moderns 


by Eric Heilman 

O rdinarily, the music 
of Mozart is not 
among the first pos¬ 
sibilities that enter 
choreographer Val Cani- 
paroli’s mind when he starts 
thinking about making a new 
ballet. In fact, Caniparoli is a 
decidedly contemporary sort 
of guy with a taste for mini¬ 
malism, tonal dissonance and 
emotional ambiguity in mu¬ 
sic. 

Two of Caniparoli’s most 
recent dances for the San 
Francisco Ballet (where he 
works as resident choreogra¬ 
pher and principal character 
dancer) were set to relatively 
obscure scores — Benjamin 
Britten’s Violin Concerto 
(1939) (for the ballet Connota¬ 
tions) and Estonian avant- 
gardist Arvo Part’s Frates 
and Tabula Rasa (for the bal¬ 
let In Perpetuum). 

But currently Caniparoli is 
immersed in Mozart. He’s 
making a new ballet, a pas de 
deux, set to Mozart’s Piano 
Concerto No. 27 in B Flat, K. 
595: Larghetto. However, the 
choreographer reassures me, 
“It wasn’t really my idea — to 
use Mozart. Helgi (Tomas- 
son, SF Ballet’s artistic direc¬ 
tor and chief choreographer) 
asked if I would make a piece 
for our Mozart program, and 
well, you know, it’s hard to 
say no. Besides, I decided 
Mozart would be a challenge 
for me.” 

Caniparoli’s new ballet 
(tentatively called Tryst, he 
reveals) will be included on 
the Ballet’s all-Mozart-music 
evenings of dance (June 25 
and 27), the company’s contri¬ 
bution to San Francisco’s 
“Mozart and His Time” festi¬ 
val. SF Ballet is joining more 
than 50 other Bay Area arts 
organizations in presenting 
works by or about Joannes 
Chrisostomus Wolfgang Got¬ 
tlieb Mozart. And just for the 
record: the composer, al¬ 
though he began calling him¬ 
self Wolfgango Amadeo in 
1770 and Wolfgang Amade in 
1777, was never, despite the 
vicissitudes of cinematic 
truth, called Wolfgang 
Amadeus. 

Finding the Contemporary 

But forget about name-call¬ 
ing. What interests choreog¬ 
rapher Caniparoli the most, 
he explains, is “finding the 
contemporary within Mozart, 
helping an audience see—and 
hear—something that has cur¬ 
rent meaning.” 

Later, Caniparoli says, “It’s 
always been music that in¬ 
spires me the most when I’m 
making a dance. And what 
I’m trying to do in this new 
piece is respond to the less- 
than-obvious qualities which 
are inherent in any Mozart 
piece. Of course, at First I 
was sort of daunted by what 
to do — there are so many 
notes in his music! There’s 
also always a very danceable 
melody. But, perhaps, one of 
the secrets to Mozart is that 
there’s a whole lot more. I’ve 
discovered layers of emotion 
in his music that I simply 
didn’t hear at first. I’m find¬ 
ing he’s rather tricky, emo¬ 
tionally speaking.” 

Caniparoli is especially en¬ 
thused to be working with 
principal dancers Evelyn Cis¬ 
neros and Anthony Randazzo, 
SF Ballet’s leading couple. 
It’s an opportunity that isn’t 


always available to a resident 
— and still junior—choreogra¬ 
pher. “I guess I feel like 
they’re my security for this 
one,” he says laughing. 
“What I mean is that Evelyn 
and Tony are two of our 
strongest dancers, they can 
virtually do anything I sug¬ 
gest. But I’m not going to 
consciously try to make a 
work that stresses classical 
technique — their forte. I 
want to push them a bit, too. 
And I want to use whatever 
ideas they may have to sug¬ 
gest.” 

In the past, Caniparoli’s 
style as a dancemaker has 
been premised on an inherent 
sense of tension — within the 
music, within steps, between 
partners and between groups 
of dancers. This was especial¬ 
ly visible in Connotations 
(1989), In Perpetuum (1990), 
Aubade (choreographed for 
the Israel Ballet and later per¬ 
formed by the Oakland Bal¬ 
let), Hamlet and Ophelia, pas 
de deux (1985), Windows 
(1984) and Love-Lies-Bleeding 
(1982). 

Caniparoli admits that he 
likes to “build tension into 
my pieces, and there are al¬ 
ways stories going on — 
they’re just not specific.” He 
also says his dances are often 
revealing of his personal self, 
however he resists the direct 
transcription of biography 
into art: “I like a style of 
movement that is theatrical 
but ambiguous — subject to 
various interpretations. I also 
think that whenever you 
make a piece, you’re showing 
parts of yourself. But I don’t 
believe in a direct translation 
— that would be so literal, so 
indulgent and boring.” 

Character Dancer 

Besides his work as a 
choreographer, which, he 
mentions, increasingly domi¬ 
nates his work in dance, Cani¬ 
paroli is an especially fine 
character dancer, mixing ele¬ 
ments of melodrama, balletic 
fluidity and personal charm. 
Balletgoers may remember 
his performances as Madge in 
La Sylphide; Wolfgang, the 
tutor, in Swan Lake; Herr 
Drosselmeyer in The 
Nutcracker; the Rich Boy in 
Filling Station; and, most re¬ 
cently, as The Tsar or, alter¬ 
nately, the Prince’s Attendant, 
in The Sleeping Beauty. 

Caniparoli believes his ear¬ 
ly training in theatre at Wash¬ 
ington State University was 
especially helpful for the 
work of a character dancer. 
But he also adds, with charac¬ 
teristic modesty, “You know I 
didn’t really have a lot of 
choice, because I took my 
first ballet class at 18! And al¬ 
though I discovered I loved 
ballet, I knew I would never 
be able to develop the tech¬ 
nique to be a prince. And be¬ 
sides, I love the character 
roies!” 

Caniparoli says that one of 
his greatest challenges as a 
character dancer was learning 
the nuances of performing en 
travesti (a role designated for 
a man who plays a woman, or 
for a woman who plays a 
man). 

“I especially enjoyed being 
coached for Madge in 
Bournonville’s La Sylphide. 
It was the first time I under¬ 
stood the difference between 
simply doing a drag role ver¬ 
sus performing en travesti. 
It’s more subtle,” he explains. 



“You’re conscious of being a 
man who is playing a woman 
— there’s a refinement in that 
irony.” 

Although he loves to per¬ 
form on the stage, Cani¬ 
paroli’s choreographic ser¬ 
vices are increasingly in de¬ 
mand in the international 
dance world. Besides his 
work for SF Ballet, Cani¬ 
paroli has made dances for 
Ballet West in Salt Lake City, 
Pacific Northwest Ballet in 
Seattle, the Israel Ballet and 
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, 
among others. His credits 
also include an unprecedent¬ 
ed 10 grants for choreography 
from the National Endow¬ 
ment for the Arts and in 1991 
he received his first Artist 
Fellowship from the Califor¬ 
nia Arts Council. 

“I’m now thinking of my¬ 
self primarily as a choreogra¬ 
pher,” Caniparoli explains. 
“I’m also concentrating on 
having my work produced by 


companies outside the Bay 
Area. It’s not that I don’t love 
San Francisco — I do. But 
I’ve noticed a trend of chore¬ 
ographers being “ghettoized” 
by only having their work 
made here. I’m also very 
lucky to have such an ideal 
working relationship with 
Helgi. We complement each 
other as choreographers, I be¬ 
lieve. But he has to run the 
whole show—besides making 
dances. That makes me the 
lucky one, I think, because I 
can get up and go do some¬ 
thing somewhere else without 
having to worry about manag¬ 
ing a company. That suits 
me very well.” 

However, Caniparoli is, 
make no mistake, very happy 
to have SF Ballet as his home 
(he joined the company in 
1973). And he is one of only a 
handful of veteran dancers 
who survived the departure 
of former artistic director 
Michael Smuin in 1985. “The 


first four years were a real 
roller coaster,” he says. “I felt 
at the time I had a special op¬ 
portunity to help hold things 
together. But now we’ve 
reached a new phase. The 
past is over and we’re push¬ 
ing forward on our own. To¬ 
day, I don’t believe there is 
any company—in the world — 
that is more versatile. We’re 
dancing at a new level — a 
higher level — than I had ever 
thought possible.” 

Caniparoli also adds, re¬ 
vealing perhaps an important 
key to his own, notable suc¬ 
cess, “Right now this is a very 
giving company. It’s not like 
that with other companies 
I’ve seen. This company real¬ 
ly likes to dance; our dancers 
project to the whole house, to 
everyone from the boxes to 
the balconies’ last rows. It’s a 
good feeling, we enjoy what 
we do.” ▼ 


THE ONLY LEGAL APHRODISIAC 


SEDUCE ANY MAN 

Draw him out of the closet with EROS Oil™. 

Stanford University researchers proved that sexual arousal is caused by 
the Oxytocin hormone. Chemists have succeeded in enhancing the 
essence of Oxytocin into an imperceptible aroma which dramatically 
stimulates a man's sexual appetite. This extraordinary formula has 
been recently released and is now available exclusively through the 
Eros Institute under the tradename EROS Oil™. 

Aromas contain a message. The message is received by the brain, 
decoded, then causes the recipient to react automatically according 
to the integrated command. The secret of the 
phenomenal success of EROS Oil™ is that it 
contains extremely potent sexual molecules 
(Androstenol and Androstenone), excitable j 
neurons that trigger a man's sexual behavior 
by releasing massive quantities of ^ 

Oxytocin. 

It's remarkable, but true! Apply EROS Oil™ 
behind your ear, your wrist or lightly on an article 
of clothing. Approach the man you want to attract,

Performance 


Through Grief to Ecstasy 


by John F. Karr 

M asculine in his 
dark and muscu¬ 
lar silence, he ap¬ 
pears from black 
depths to loom over the frail 
woman who has fallen be¬ 
tween his feet. She disap¬ 
pears as if drawn up within 
the strange power that be¬ 
strides her, and the man 
glowers, a smile that is both 
invitation and doom. He 
wears a shiny white silk 
dress, and his taut, muscled 
arms bear a menacing whip. 
The vision is striking in its 
simplicity, shockingly foreign 
yet everlastingly known to us. 

It’s only one of the many 
memorable, breathless mo¬ 
ments that make up Contra¬ 
band’s alluring Mira, Cycle 
One, which opened here in 
May, toured the Midwest and 
East Coast, and has just be¬ 
gun a two-weekend run at 
Theatre Artaud. Mira, Cycle 
One is a luscious evening 
that intermingles throbblingly 
hypnotic music with dialogue 


that is sensually overripe and 
frequently disconcerting in its 
brutal candor and dance that 
is entrancingly original and 
exuberantly physical. 


"If we really 
show who we 
are, we become 
extraordinarily 
perverse, and 
we challenge 
status quo im¬ 
ages from start 
to finish." 

—Keith Hennessy 


Surprisingly, as it tells the 
story of an abandoned girl 
child from Tennessee, Mira, 
Cycle One strikes home 
closely and repeatedly with 
gay images and issues as it 



works toward healing our cul¬ 
tural alienation from our bod¬ 
ies, the Earth and the ecstatic. 

Ecstasy is the show’s true 
home, but to reach it we must 
make a frightening journey 
through the wars that rage 
outside and which are only a 
reflection of the wars of our 
dark, inner selves—■ cunningly 
represented by Keith Hen¬ 
nessy in his white satin dress. 

“I’m playing an inner side 
of Sara (the director of Con¬ 
traband who created the 
piece in collaboration with 
the company),” said the per¬ 
former. “I’m the dark one. My 
role is to introduce the dark 
section of the piece, which is 
going to be loud and chaotic 
and interruptive.” 

Battle to Be Fought 

The pretty stuff is over, 
the character is saying. 
There’s a battle to be fought. 

“If the audience is ready 
for it,” Hennessy said, “they’ll 
get to experience a deep per¬ 
sonal story and wound, they’ll 
be ready for grief, ready for 
the intense ecstasy of the end¬ 
ing, with more outrageous 
dancing than we do at the be¬ 
ginning.” 

But at the moment of his 
entrance, nothing seems more 
outrageous than the image he 
presents, menacing yet per¬ 
versely comforting. 

“It’s a very specific queer 
image,” Hennessy said, not at 
all surprised that his director 



Keith Hennessy plays the dark side of Sara Shelton Mann in 
Mira, Cycle One. 


created the image for him. 
“And I think it’s no accident 
that I play the part. There’s a 
very conscious choice within 
Contraband to bring out the 
fullest of each person. But 
when Sara sees me, she 
doesn’t even need to think in 
terms of political constructs 
like identities of sexuality. If 
she’s going to bring out the 
fullest me, sooner or later I’m 
going to end up naked or in a 
dress.” 

Much of Hennessy’s con¬ 
cerns as reflected in his char¬ 
acter in Mira hover around 
body and sexuality issues. 
Similar to “the muscle seg¬ 
ment” of the show, where a 
line of flexing muscle gods is 
fronted by a goddess, the in¬ 
tention lies not merely with a 
strong image, but with the de¬ 
sire to show a true aspect of 
the performer, in the example 


of Kim Epifano, a woman of 
powerful force. 

“If we really show who we 
are,” Hennessy explained, 
“we become extraordinarily 
perverse, and we challenge 
status quo images from start 
to finish. One of the reasons I 
stay with Contraband,” he 
said, “is because the commu¬ 
nity that we are is prepared 
to make a place for the im¬ 
ages that we are, just on the 
level that that challenges 
dominant culture image on an 
everyday basis.” 

Challenging our intellect 
and stirring our emotion as it 
feeds our senses a rich and el¬ 
egant evening of dance and 
music, Mira, Cycle One is an 
intoxicating brew. ▼

Tune Turns 'Birdie'Into Star Vehicle 

Puttin' on the Gloss 


by John F. Karr 

I t’s true you can’t go 
home again, but you can 
get at least half way 
there in the current 
mounting of the 1960 Broad¬ 
way hit, Bye Bye Birdie, 
playing at the Golden Gate 
Theatre through June 30. 
BBB was one of those shows 
which, in about an eight-year 
span from 1955-63, helped 
create a golden age of musi¬ 
cals. 

But we’d be wrong to 
think of this as a revival. It is 
most emphatically not a 
recreation of the original, al¬ 
though there’s nothing in the 
advertising or packaging to 
tell us exactly what sort of hy¬ 
brid it is. Through the efforts 
of original cast member Ed 
Kresley, we are given the ma¬ 
jor share of Gower Champi¬ 
on’s choreography, although 
Champion’s name is men¬ 
tioned nowhere and Kresley 
gets the choreographer’s cred¬ 
it. 

All other elements of the 
show have been randomly 
transformed, and what was 
once a well-scripted (if full of 
racial slurs embarrassingly 
not recognized as such at the 
time) and craftily constructed 
ensemble show has become a 
slick star vehicle. Some of the 
scenery has been updated, 
from warm cutouts to pop-art 
tinker toys, and the costumes 
hyped. Much of the dialogue 
has been pruned away, mak¬ 
ing for a tighter show but also 
making it more of a revue as 
well. 

Sit-Com Cartoon 

We have little empathy for 


the one-dimensional charac¬ 
ters, nor are we given much 
time to care. This scaled- 
down version of the show, as 
played by Tommy Tune and 
abetted by director Jerry 
Saks, turns the story into a 
cartoon, reducing it from a ro¬ 
mantic comedy about two 
people and a satirical tale 
about fame and the music biz 
to sit-com. This is less a re¬ 
mounting of BBB than a 
gloss on it. 

Although striving for it, 
and finally breaking the ice 
far too late in the game with 
an aside to the audience 
which should have come in 
the first five minutes, the 
show loses the original’s 
famed innocence because of 
its premeditated hard sell. 
There’s even a flag-waving 
show curtain buying into — or 
feeding — our current war 
fever. If they’d gone a little 
more bucolic, the good time 
would have been there of its 
own accord. Only veteran 
player Marilyn Cooper suc¬ 
ceeds by underplaying her 
harpy Mother role. 

Co-star Ann Reinking, in 
the Chita Rivera role, was in¬ 
disposed at the performance I 
saw, singing off-key and play¬ 
ing her role mechanically. 
We hope her recovered health 
will lead to a star perfor¬ 
mance. A new song has been 
composed for Mr. Tune. Al¬ 
though it throws the second 
act out of balance and is of a 
markedly different texture 
than the rest of the score, it 
provides Tommy with a swell 
solo dance. 

In the role of Conrad 
Birdie, Marc Kudisch is a no¬ 
table improvement on the 


original, who didn’t get to 
show (or have) such remark¬ 
able cleavage or clipped tum¬ 
my hair. A tasty, dimpled 
dish, Mr. Kudisch is a hot 
singer, too, and jolted us to at¬ 
tention with his songs. Fine 
supporting playing, too, from 
Susan Egan in the role that 
launched Susan Watson’s ca¬ 
reer, Jessica Stone as a shriek¬ 
ing teenager and the rest of 
the ensemble. 

A Star Personality 

Mr. Tune was Mr. Tune, 
which is to say, a star person¬ 
ality all the way. I’d have pre¬ 
ferred someone who fit him¬ 
self to the show, instead of 
vice versa. But the powers 
that be generally ignored the 
true nature of the show, 
which is discernible in the 
cozy charm of songs such as 
“Talk to Me,” “Rosie” and the 
easygoing “Put on a Happy 
Face.” This was a show once 
loaded with charm and youth¬ 
ful spirits, here turned into its 
television adaptation in which 
those qualities are indicated 
instead of played. 

Although it reintroduces 
ns to an ever-sprightly score, 
this version of Bye Bye Birdie 
left me generally unengaged. 
I’m not yet the tired business¬ 
man. Although it’s done up 
big and pretty, I think we can 
expect the best Broadway 
names could, and should, 
have done better. ▼

Beauty 

(Continued from page 33) 

degree, and I don’t think 
many people want to admit. 
They just want to dismiss it 
as shallow. Most of us are in 
the position now where most 
of our material needs are tak¬ 
en care of. Whereas most of 
our parents were brought up 
in the Depression and were 
just thinking about “how do I 
survive?” So many of our ma¬ 
terial needs, even though we 
are living in little closets, are 
taken care of. 

You’re talking about the 
white, middle middle-class? 

Yeah, which is most of the 
country. I mean I know there 
are exceptions. I know there 
are homeless. 

You’re not sure of the per¬ 
centage? 

I’m not a sociologist, but I 
think so many have most of 
their needs taken care of, and 
what most people are doing 
with that is living in a really 
comfortable apartment or 
home and watching a VCR. 
There’s a level of freedom 
and leisure that we’ve never 
had before. So on one level I 
realize the narcissism and the 
decadence of obsessing on 
beauty, but we’re in a posi¬ 
tion in a society where we 
can take our lives to so many 
different places now. We have 
the freedom to do whatever 
we want. I mean all this NEA 
bullshit about things being re¬ 
pressed or oppressed, I don’t 
think that’s happening at all. 

The NEA? 

Since when do cool people 
look to a government or bu¬ 
reaucracy for money or for 


support? You have to think 
that it’s inherent that if you 
do anything generally inter¬ 
esting, generally cutting edge, 
generally bold, why the fuck 
should the government fund 
you or why should a bureau¬ 
cracy fund you? And that’s 
what we’re talking about! So 
that’s true that interesting 
artists are not being funded 
by the NEA. It would always 
be nice to get a grant, and 
you and I would take a grant 
in a minute. But you 
shouldn’t expect it! 

We can’t get Hollywood to 
make a really radical gay 
movie. 

I think we need to work 
on that. Madonna said in her 
Advocate interview that she 
wants to do Giovanni’s Room, 
and that’s a start. I’m sure 
there’s a level of homophobia 
in Hollywood, but Hollywood 
just wants to make money. If 
we can somehow show that a 
gay movie can make money, 
then Hollywood will make 
gay movies. Did you read 
James Baldwin’s Giovanni’s 
Room? I love that novel. 

Back to yoifr novel, it basi¬ 
cally explores severed ques¬ 
tions about beauty, doesn’t 
it? 

What I’m obsessed with 
and what the character in 
Pizza Face is obsessed with 
is, “What do you do?” (The 
book’s) also about not be¬ 
ing blind to things. What 
do you do if you’re obsessed 
with beauty and you’re really, 
really ugly? That would be 
the scariest thing to do is to 
admit that you’re obsessed' 
with beauty even if you’re un¬ 
sightly. 

All you have to do is get 
rich and famous, then you 
can have all the beauty you 
want. 



Pizza Face author Ken Siman 


Umm, you can buy beauty 
but I’m talking about some¬ 
one who can never possess 
beauty. “Possess” not as in 
“fucking it” but “possess” in 
“having it,” being beautiful 
yourself. 

With plastic surgery nowa¬ 
days they are performing 
miracles. They can make 
you look like whomever 
you want. 

Really? Oh, I don’t think 
so. Look at Michael Jackson 
... The level of beauty I’m 
talking about you can’t be 
conscious of knowing any¬ 
thing else, and once you 
know what it’s not like to be 
beautiful. ... That’s part of 
the arrogance and the inno¬ 
cence of beauty though. 

But the beautiful character 
in your book was a bastard. 


Oh, yeah, but that’s because 
he didn’t know what was going 
on around him and he didn’t 
really want to know. You don’t 
have to when you’re that 
beautiful because most of your 
immediate needs are taken 
care of. ▼

Serious Belly Laughs 

Pizza Face 

by Ken Siman; Grove Weidenfeld, $17.95 


by James Tushinski 

I wonder how someone 
who has been gorgeous 
all his or her life would 
react to Ken Siman’s 
wildly comic and sharply 
satiric first novel, Pizza Face. 
After all, its protagonist, 
Andy, could only be de¬ 
scribed as ugly and therefore 
probably wouldn’t inspire 
much empathy among the 
beautiful people. For those of 
us who were misfits as chil¬ 
dren and adolescents, howev¬ 
er, Pizza Face is both a nasty 
good time and a painful trip 
down memory lane. 

Tall and skinny, with a 
face ravaged by severe acne, 
Andy grows up in North Car¬ 
olina in the mid-1970s. He’s 
lonely and despised by his 
peers, so he turns to following 
political campaigns for solace, 
relishing the hoopla and 
bright lights. He starts collect¬ 
ing campaign buttons, writes 
letters to politicians, and 
eventually develops a particu¬ 
lar liking for Jimmy Carter, 
who is the only candidate to 
send Andy a personally auto¬ 
graphed photo. After high 
school, he takes off for Wash¬ 
ington, D.C., hoping to fit into 
politics somehow, and ends 
up the assistant to a cocaine- 
snorting, boy-crazy political 
gossipmonger. 

Siman uses Andy’s misfor¬ 
tunes to create a deadpan, pi¬ 
caresque novel about the at¬ 
tractions and shallowness of 
beauty and power. As Andy 
grows up, developing crushes 
on a series of handsome boys 
and having just about every¬ 
thing he attempts to accom¬ 
plish fall flat on its face, 
Siman’s amazing control of 
tone lets the novel teeter on 
the borders of bitchiness, 
sympathy and cruel humor 
without once sliding into dis¬ 
tastefulness or sentimentality. 

Andy had planned his out¬ 
fit — the slippery parakeet 
shirt, puka-shell necklace and 
earth shoes. Plus he wore a 
big pimple on his chin, his 
first. ... He looked at his re¬ 
flection in the full-length mir¬ 
ror and spit on it. ... Andy 
took off his clothes. He was 
about to meet (Jimmy Carter) 
the man of his dreams and 
looked like doo. He settled 
for a plain white shirt and 
pinned on his favorite button, 
“Jimmy — the Spirit of 76.” 
He put a little piece of mask¬ 
ing tape over his pimple, 
since the only Band-Aids 
around were concussion size. 

Weird Reveries 

While Andy is the protago¬ 
nist of Pizza Face, Siman 
creates a weird universe of 
peripheral characters whose 
lives barely but significantly 
intersect with Andy’s life. In 
a series of odd, but entertain¬ 
ing asides, Siman takes the 
reader into these people’s 
goofy lives. The most extend-

habit today. That connection, 
that grounding in a women’s 
community, is what needs to 
be explored, every bit as 
much as the “burden” Catholi¬ 
cism may have left us with. 

The Nun 

Castro. June 22, 12 noon 


i?IZZ A 



ed reverie concerns the ficti¬ 
tious North Carolina gover¬ 
nor’s wife, Carolina (“CG”) 
Chesire, whose recipes in the 
“Carolina Living” section of 
the daily newspaper inspire 
Andy. Carolina’s “acorn- 
brown hair was piled high, 
nearly up to providence, and 
made her a little taller than 
her husband, Governor Lu¬ 
cius Chesire — even though 
his own pompadour was pret¬ 
ty big, too.” 

Pizza Face is full of the 
awful and the wonderful of 
1970s American culture, and 
one might be tempted to cry 
“nostalgia” if the references 
and details weren’t so funny 
or perfectly integrated. The 
novel could also be dismissed 
as just another Southern 
grotesque, but Siman’s strong 
sense of comedy keeps the 
weirdness close enough to re¬ 
ality to avoid self-indulgence. 

By far the most impressive 
thing about Pizza Face is the 
level of seriousness that lurks 
beneath the comedy. Siman 
infuses a lot of pain into the 
book, forcing us to laugh even 
when it seems more appropri¬ 
ate to cry or glumly shake 
our heads in empathy. 

Pizza Face looks at the 
disenfranchised and marginal, 
using an ugly gay man as its 
focus, and gets the reader to 
see the silliness behind Amer¬ 
ica’s obsession with politics 
and beauty. Andy’s twin ob¬ 
sessions mirror the whole 
country’s obsession and, like 
too many people, when his at¬ 
tempts at being like the rich, 
beautiful and famous contin¬ 
ue to fail, Andy’s actions final¬ 
ly take a darker turn. 

Yet Siman’s off-the-wall, 
somewhat twisted sense of 
humor keeps bubbling up 
from the work’s serious core 
and covers the book with a 
tart and frothy coating. Any¬ 
one who enjoyed John 
Kennedy O’Toole’s A Con¬ 
federacy of Dunces or Fay 
Weldon’s The Lives and 
Loves of a She Devil will 
find similar delights in Pizza 
Face. It’s a fast, compulsive 
read that brings belly laughs 
the first time around, but of¬ 
fers enough intelligence and 
insight to encourage another 
look. ▼

Escape from Peyton Place 

(Continued from page 33) 


quiet while they sang. And 
once I realized that world was 
there, I became obsessed. By 
the time I was five, my par¬ 
ents were letting me go to the 
movies by myself. They’d 
drop me off at the revival 
houses, and I’d spend the day 
watching movies over and 
over. The rest just kind of 
evolved from there.” 

The evolution Harris men¬ 
tions may have started out as 
a boy’s means of fending off 
personal pain, but it ended up 
as a man’s life’s work — what 
Harris considers his true call¬ 
ing. And on that point, there 
can be no argument from any¬ 
one who has ever heard Har¬ 
ris belt out a ballad or wrap 
his agile, fluent voice around 
the heart of longing in a ro¬ 
mantic lyric. Through June 
16, Harris will work his mag¬ 
ic at the Plush Room Cabaret 
in San Francisco’s York Ho¬ 
tel. 

Time for Another Look 

Meanwhile, for those who 
still identify Harris as that 
guy from Star Search, it’s 
high time for another look. 
Long gone is the boy pop star 
with the oversized jackets and 
the tennis shoes. A serious 
man — a serious artist — has 
taken his place. 

In part, the transformation 
is calculated. After several 
bad years with Motown and a 
personal hiatus, Harris is un¬ 
der new management, and he 
and his people are busy creat¬ 
ing a Sam Harris for the ’90s. 
In another way, however, the 
change is purely organic: 
Harris turned 30 during the 
first week of June and, he de¬ 
clares, achieving that mile¬ 
stone was both healthy and 


exciting. 

“I’m not a little boy any¬ 
more,” Harris says. “I’ve 
grown up some.” And, oh 
yes, he grins, “I’m much, 
much, much, wiser!” 

One of the important 
changes brought about by 
“growing up” is that Harris 
has “stopped running from 
(the association with) Star 
Search. I do hope and pray 
to go on to greater and 
grander things where that’s 
just sort of a footnote,” he 
says, “but, hey, that is what 
gave me some attention.” 

The sudden fame that 
came to Harris after 16 con¬ 
secutive weeks on Star 
Search, however, was what 
pushed him into a dangerous 
period of “overanalyzing” his 
career and into an over¬ 
whelming fear of being pi¬ 
geonholed as a “one-note 
singer.” He explains, “I so 
wanted everybody to know 
how much more to me there 
was than that I could come 
out and sing a ballad and put 
my heart on my sleeve. 
(Then) at Motown (where he 
completed two albums), I 
quickly found out that the 
fantasy of being the Great 
White Hope on a black label 
was not happening. And I 
was really happy to get out of 
that situation.” 

After some time off to “get 
his life straightened out,” Har¬ 
ris found his way to Stiletto, 
his new management compa¬ 
ny. “The great thing Stiletto 
did,” says Harris, “is they told 
me to stop trying to think of 
what you should be, and go 
do what you want. Go home 
and pick your favorite songs 
and let’s do a show. Use your 
gift and stop trying to think 



Sam Harris calls his style an 
amalgamation of "theatre, 
black church and torch sing¬ 
ing." 


about where you should be 
going next or what’s commer¬ 
cial. And it was the first time 
someone in a position to man¬ 
age me had said something 
like that.” 

Unofficial Gay Anthem 

Today, Harris’ show in¬ 
cludes almost exclusively 
what he calls “great old 
songs” — the kind of stan¬ 
dards, torch songs and unfor¬ 
gettable lyrics about which it 
is often said, “They just don’t 
write ’em like that anymore.” 
Harris did carry one thing 
with him from his Star 
Search days, however, and 
that is his signature version of 
“Somewhere Over the Rain¬ 
bow.” 

As a kind of fundamental 
plea for solace and deliver¬ 
ance, “Over the Rainbow” has 
always contained a special 
message for the many gay 
men (and not a few lesbians) 
who have identified them¬ 


selves as “friends of 
Dorothy’s.” In fact, if there is 
such a thing as tribal con¬ 
sciousness in queerdom, 
“Over the Rainbow” — a kind 
of unofficial gay anthem for 
more than four decades — 
may be an expression of it. 

“What’s behind the song,” 
Harris explains, “is the idea 
that ‘somewhere there’s a 
place where I won’t hurt any¬ 
more.’ You can call that a 
gay anthem or (the anthem of) 
,any repressed group. I think 
it’s in every person, no matter 
what they are, but (especially) 
when it comes to a communi¬ 
ty that’s oppressed, and wants 
just the simplest things, like 
to be treated as human be¬ 
ings, with respect. 

“Actually,” he adds, “I’m 
not sure it would have (the 
same connotations) without 
Judy Garland. As it’s sung in 
The Wizard of Oz, it’s really 
quite pretty, a sweet little lul¬ 
laby. But the reason it has 
such pain behind it is because 
it was later interpreted — by 
Garland to begin with — as 
‘Oh my God, there’s got to be : 
something better than this, 
nightmare I’m living.’ Which 
anybody who feels like 
they’re in the same boat can 
relate to.” (So deeply did 
singing “Over the Rainbow” 
affect Garland, one biogra¬ 
pher reveals, that the star rit¬ 
ually took a shot of Canadian 
Club to fortify herself when¬ 
ever she performed the song 
in concert.) 

“Over the Rainbow” is not 
the only Harold Arlen song in 


Harris’ repertory, however — 
largely because Arlen just 
happens to be the composer 
of “every song I love,” Harris 
says. Aden's famous tunes in¬ 
clude “Blues in the Night,” 
“Get Happy,” “The Man I 
Love,” and “When the Sun 
Comes Out” — as well as “Sa¬ 
tan’s Little Lamb” and “Wail 
of the Reefer Man,” two less¬ 
er-known numbers that Har¬ 
ris has particularly enjoyed 
reviving in his show. 

“The lyric is so important 
to me,” Harris says. “If you’re 
looking for something that re¬ 
ally touches you, a true, hon¬ 
est lyric gets me every time.” 
Those “true, honest” lyrics, it 
is clear, make a particularly 
happy marriage with Harris’ 
unique style — what he calls 
an amalgamation of “theatre, 
black church and torch 
singing.” 

Harris adds, “To me, 
there’s nothing more exciting 
than singing these songs that 
are 50, 60 years old, that are 
real discoveries. And I love 
performing live more than 
anything in the world. If 
you’re fortunate enough to be 
doing something you enjoy, 
that’s real bliss.” And bliss is 
not bad for a sad boy from 
Oklahoma who started out 
wanting little more than a 
glimpse of life on the other 
side of the rainbow. ▼

Glam on the Rampage

by Justin Bond 

i i A ▼ ith madness as 

» l\ I vom ^» ** 

•I »/ is the passerby 

W W who receives 
the inconvenience.” That 
quote is from the late great 
queer playwright JOE OR¬ 
TON and it comes to mind as 
applicable to GGREG TAY¬ 
LOR at the POISON party 
last week. All I know is a lot 
of people went to a lot of 
trouble to see the brilliant 
young filmmaker TODD 
HAYNES, director of one of 
the greatest, most innovative, 
sexy films to ever come along, 
and all they got was Ggreg 
Taylor hogging the spotlight 
— as usual. 

The very gorgeous Todd 
barely got a chance to say 
two words before MISS 
WELCOME TO ME ripped 
the microphone out of his 
hands and started in with her 
usual drivel. I could have 
SPIT NAILS. I mean, how of¬ 
ten do we get a real celebrity 
in our midst? Especially a 
queer who is making such art¬ 
fully innovative work as Miss 
Haynes? 

... Did I sound BITTER a 
few sentences ago? I’m sorry 
Ggreg, maybe I’m just being 
catty. There were some real 
celebrities. Artist NAYLAND 
BLAKE was there, so were 
two of the three ABSOLUT 
MANPUSSIES and several 
TEMPLE WHORES. I per¬ 
sonally appreciated seeing 
several of the gorgeous men 
who work at CAFE FLORE 
dancing without their shirts 
on to the sounds of GRAVITY. 


Bash of the Week 

After leaving the Poison 
party several of us made our 
way to the GLAM-BASH of 
the week - WHERED’EGO? 
at VIVID — a birthday party 
for SOPHIA LAMARR. As 
soon as I walked in the door I 
knew it was going to be a 
good one because I saw that 
sexy stud DJ DON BAIRD, 
which immediately sent my 
hormones raging. Then all of 
a sudden I began to feel like 
LINDA BLAIR in the Exor¬ 
cist because my head was 
spinning around trying to 
catch sight of all the luminar¬ 
ies swirling about me. 

But the star of the evening 
was SOPHIA herself. Not 
only is Sophia a fashion inspi¬ 
ration to us all, but she’s got a 
social conscience as well. She 
loves the little people for she 


knows it’s them that made 
her. She practically had to be 
dragged to her rightful place 
in the V.I.P. Lounge where 
she was hawking her latest 
product - INSTANT PUSSY. 
According to Sophia, “It only 
lasts 15 minutes so whatever 
you do, you have to do it 
fast.” We’re going to miss her 
when she moves to the East 
Coast to DEEP THROAT 
the big apple. 

Speaking of instant pussy, 
it’s time to pop some MIDOL 
and PEPSI and buzz on 
down to the ON OUR RAGS 
benefit June 22 at SNATCH. 
This party, which will include

Sometimes I wonder 
where we would be if we 
didn’t have to constantly raise 
money to make up for our 
government’s moral and spir¬ 
itual bankruptcy. Certainly 
there wouldn’t be as many 
good parties. Last week at 
the STUD and this week at 
KLUBSTITUTE there were 
two grand soirees to raise 
money for SF’s Needle Ex¬ 
change Program. Living leg¬

hooed queen of cabaret, per¬ 
formed, as did FLYNN, my 
favorite Baltimore girl-made-

a sick display of cosmetic tor¬

CHAOS has finally closed 
... thank God. In its heyday at ~ 
the Crystal Pistol, Chaos was 
the sleaziest, tackiest, nastiest, 
wildest place in town. Punks, 
Dykes, Drag Queens, Anar¬ 
chists, Artists — all the 
hippest and wildest people — 
fried their bodies and their 
minds to the sizzle of MIKE 
and LEWIS’ heavy industrial 
sounds. Since moving to 
Nightbreak on Haight all it’s 
been is an excuse for a bunch 
of tired MACY’S QUEENS 
to don their CLONE DRAG 
and pretend they’re some¬ 
thing they’re not — namely 
butch. Look forward to a new 
club from Mike and Lewis 
soon. I’d pay money just to 
catch a glimpse of Sex God

now, BYE-BYE BIRDIES.V

Opera 


Whose 'Flute' Is It, Anyway? 


by George Heymont 

A nyone who has 
been in the opera 
business for a while 
knows how night¬ 
opening nights can be. 
The audience’s expectations 
are dangerously high, the 
artists often feel under-re¬ 
hearsed and the results are 
frequently disappointing. The 
pressures of opening night 
are one of the many reasons 
why I often find myself at 
odds with members of the 
mainstream musical press, 
whose editorial aim is to cov¬ 
er the news as it breaks. Be¬ 
cause of their influence, open¬ 
ing nights take on a critical 
significance — often in danger¬ 
ous ways that magnify the 
evening’s stress factors way 
out of proportion. 

Over the years, I have 
learned that while opening 
nights in the opera business 
tend to feel like bad dress re¬ 
hearsals, by the second or 
third performance (when the 
heat of combat is over) a 
healthy ensemble is starting 
to build. The final perfor¬ 
mance of a run will often be 
the best because the perform¬ 
ers are relaxed, have learned 
how to trust each other, and 
have been able to weld a tight 
artistic mesh. 

That’s why, in nearly two 
decades of attending the San 
Francisco Opera I’ve learned 
to stay away from seasonal 
opening nights. The chem¬ 
istry is usually out of whack 
and the audience is too keen¬ 
ly locked into that destructive 
“this opening night better 


make-it-or-break it” mentality. 

This month my hunch 
proved correct again. Feed¬ 
back on the summer season’s 
opening performance of 
Mozart’s The Magic Flute 
was scathingly negative, de¬ 
pending on which critics one 
chose to believe. And yet, by 
the third performance, the 
San Francisco Opera’s revival 
of David Hockney’s produc¬ 
tion offered one of the most 
enjoyable interpretations of 
The Magic Flute that I’ve 
ever experienced. Most of the 
credit goes to director Paula 
Williams who, after many 


Paula 
Williams 
brought life 
and spiritual¬ 
ity back to The 
Magic Flute. 


years of assisting other stage 
directors, has finally landed in 
the driver’s seat. In the pro¬ 
cess, Ms. Williams has not 
lost sight of one of the most 
important factors affecting 
live opera: the audience. 

Earlier this year, when the 
Metropolitan Opera rented 
Hockney’s production of The 
Magic Flute, audiences and 
critics greeted most perfor¬ 
mances with stifled yawns. 
What happened? The stage 
director took the Met’s stan¬ 
dard museum-like approach 
to the piece, stripping it of its 


humanity and comedic im¬ 
pact. As usual, there were no 
supertitles at the Met. But 
Mozart did not compose The 
Magic Flute as a clinically in¬ 
tellectual exercise. He wrote 
it as a piece of musical the¬ 
ater, meant to entertain a 
popular audience. 


Breathing Naturally 

Too often, stage directors 
forget that, which is why we 
should all get down on our 
hands and knees and thank 
God for people like Paula 
Williams (who will direct this 
fall’s revival of Bizet’s Car¬ 
men). Ms. Williams brought 
an incredible amount of life 
and spirituality back to the 
Hockney production, trans¬ 
forming The Magic Flute 
into the kind of superbly the¬ 
atrical experience which 
Mozart lovers rarely have the 
opportunity to enjoy at the 
War Memorial Opera House. 
Her determination to let the 
stage action breathe naturally 
was supported by Gerard 
Schwarz’s sensitive conduct¬ 
ing (which was nowhere as 
gruesome as the mainstream 
press would lead readers to 
believe). 

The 1991 cast was particu¬ 
larly impressive, with Jerry 
Hadley offering an unusually 
strong Tamino and soprano 
Ruth Ann Swenson deliver¬ 
ing a radiantly sung Pamina. 
While particularly nice 
cameos came from the 
campy, muscular Steven Cole 
as the evil Monostatos and 



Baritone Michael Kraus 


from Sally Wolfs star-blazing 
Queen of the Night, I found 
myself totally charmed by 
Michael Kraus’ Papageno — a 
characterization that glowed 
with the kind of warmth and 
humanity one always associ¬ 
ates with this character but 
rarely witnesses on stage. 


Living the Role 

All too often, a baritone 
will take his stock characteri¬ 
zation of Papageno from one 
production to another. Or else 
a stage director will superim¬ 
pose successful bits of shtick 
on an artist’s performance 


which, at their best, seem 
faintly comical and basically 
gratuitous. In his San Francis¬ 
co Opera debut, Kraus per¬ 
formed Papageno as if he 
were actually living the role 
in the moment. He brought 
with him a performance style 
of such tightly knit theatrical 
integrity that one was not 
only forced to admire his 
craft, but wonder at the fact 
that the artistic strength of his 
performance never once 
tipped the evening off bal¬ 
ance. 

Other contributions includ¬ 
ed a strongly directed trio of 
maidens (Patricia Racette, 
Yanyu Guo, Catherine Keen), 
Kevin Langan’s usually dry 
Sarastro, Thomas Stewart’s 
wizened Speaker, and Laura 
Claycomb’s lusty Papagena. 
Of particular note is the fact 
that 1991’s Pamina and Saras¬ 
tro were graduates of the San 
Francisco Opera’s Merola pro¬ 
gram — an operation whose 
long list of alumni has added 
immeasurably to the interna¬ 
tional opera scene in recent 
years. 

If I find it especially nice 
to watch these artists blossom 
into maturity on the stage 
where they earned their pro¬ 
fessional stripes, that’s be¬ 
cause the ripening of one’s 
craft over time is a major part 
of the artistic process which is 
frequently ignored by the mu¬ 
sic industry. ▼

T he second volume of 
lesbian love stories 
from Crossing Press 
is a delightful collec¬ 
tion having in common only 
the multi-dimensioned con¬ 
cept “lesbian.” The writing is 
so fine, however, that even 
with the many and varied ap¬ 
proaches and styles the writ¬ 
ers use, there is a wonderful 
sense of stylistic coherence. 

Tee A. Corrine’s “Sum¬ 
mer: An Ordinary Story” is a 
highly concentrated, erotic 
gem. And if Tee makes love 
only one-tenth as well as she 
writes about it, her lovers 
must be the happiest women 
on the planet: 

She touches me and it's 
early summer, or autumn, or 
winter with its heavy rain. 
She touches me and it's 
spring or fall or almost win¬ 
ter or summer’s end with fes¬ 
tivals and naked women’s 
bodies. 

This is erotica without tin¬ 
sel and glamour, a celebration 
of the pleasure, the simply 
profound, significantly ordi¬ 
nary pleasure we give to each 
other. Yes. 

If you read Nancy Drew 
mysteries when you were 
younger, and if you won¬ 
dered, as I did, just what the 
story was with George, Nan¬ 
cy’s tomboy friend, and what 
Nancy saw in her dopey 
boyfriend, Ned Nickerson, 
wonder no more. Susan J. 
Leonardi reveals all and, of 
course, Nancy solves a mys¬ 
tery (or two), in “The Secret 
of the Silenced Singer.” The 
writing is delightful, as when 
Nancy writes to George about 
being introduced to her 
daughter’s friend: 

“Nell, this is my mother 
who will want you to call her 


Lesbian Love 
Stories 

mm i 



Mmm 


Nancy, in part because she 
has become a Californian, in 
part because she’s confused 
about her last name at the 
moment, being of that gener¬ 
ation of women who took 
their husband’s patronymic at 
marriage and grew to think it 
loathsome.’’ The child has 
been in England too long. 

The story took me back to 
my adolescent fantasies about 
Nancy, with her titian hair, 
and her courage, and her un¬ 
questioned (by anyone with a 
brain) abilities. Nancy taught 
us that we could do anything, 
no matter how hard the cul¬ 
ture tried to insist we could 
not, and her return is 
exhilarating. 

Joan Nestle negotiates 
chronic illness with acute de¬ 
sire when “A Feeling Comes.” 
Carolyn Gage teaches us 
“How to Write a Convincing 
Seduction Scene.” Jody is 
comforted by a prostitute in 
Lee Lynch’s heart-rending 
“Truckstop Woman.” I could 
go on, but I’m sure you get it. 
Irene Zahava has provided us 
with marvelous collections of 
well-written, highly charged, 
stories. I only hope she’s busy 
working on Volume Three 
right now. ▼

by Nancy Boutilier 

Everyone had reason to 
shake Sunday at Balboa 
Field. If the foggy chill and 
relentless wind wasn’t enough 
to send folks home shaking 
from teeth to cleats, Box It’s 
continued cruise to victory 
was sure to leave no head un¬ 
shook on the sidelines. 

On Box It’s bench, heads 
shook with disappointment 
because players and coaches 
know the team is capable of 
cleaner, tighter play, and 
that’s what they’ll need at the 
Gay World Series. Frustra¬ 
tion was the cause for the 
headshakes on the opposing 
bench because Box It doesn’t 
offer up any evidence that 
they can be beaten in the 
league. 

Box It leaves heads shak¬ 
ing in the stands with amaze¬ 
ment because it’s so clear that 
even when Box It is a bit flat, 


they’re are still the best in the 
GSL — they hit with power, 
field with flash and daring, 
and throw flames across the 
field. The team more than 
makes up for its inconsistency 
with its abilities. 

So even though Box It’s 
play seems inconsistent, their 
record is not. They can spend 
another week polishing up 
their perfect 9-0 record after 
besting Cafe San Marcos, 12- 
4, Sunday in the fog at Balboa 
Field. Then thanks to a nine- 
run rally in the fourth inning 
sparked by Peggy Critz’s 
bases-loaded double, Box It 
blasted Leticia’s, 14-1. 

Tasteless Comments 

Both Cafe San Marcos and 
Leticia’s had impressive wins 
of their own. Cafe San Mar¬ 
cos, paced by pitcher Sarah 
Lynch’s home-run blast, beat 
the Cinch, 10-1. Leticia’s best¬ 
ed Mint/Sweet Inspiration, 8- 


Corral player is out at second trying to turn a single into a double against the Pendulum Bucs

2, with Jaime Yamamura’s 
run-ins with the left-field 
shrubbery causing plenty of 
“oohs” and “aahs” in addition 
to tasteless comments about 
bushes. 

When Leticia’s would not 
be shut out by Box It, it was 
Cassandra McKinley who 
scored their only run to spark 
the team’s cheering section. 
But team SMMILE had no 
runs to cheer about this week 
as the Motherlode snapped 
their one-game winning 
streak which started last 
week when SMMILE won its 
first game of the season by 
pulling out all the stops to 
come from behind for an 11- 
10 victory over the Pendulum 
Bucs. SMMILE scorekeeper 
Jeff Stiarwalt rose from the 
bench to the occasion last 
week by knocking in the win¬ 
ning run in extra innings, but 
this week he was too busy 
writing down all the Mother- 
lode’s runs for any last-minute 
heroics in the lopsided 21-0 
shutout. 

Stiarwalt had the Mother- 
lode’s Andy Anderson down 
for a perfect 4-for-4 at the 
plate, and SMMILE did have 
reason to hoot and holler 
when Rich Franzblau lost his 
hat but held onto the fly ball 
in right field for the day’s 
best catch. 

The loudest hooting and 
hollering was heard in the 
Pendulum Pirate’s win over 
Rolo. When a fan stepped be¬ 
hind the backstop to suggest 
to Rolo’s catcher that Dale 


Gay Games 


Grimsrude’s baserunning be 
questioned, the umpire con¬ 
curred and called Grimsrude 
out — the correct call, no 
doubt, but a call which en¬ 
courages later appeals. So 
when a second appeal suc¬ 
ceeded and Pirate Kenny 
Phillips was out on the 
basepath, there was plenty of 
hooting and hollering. 

Push never did come to 
shove, and everyone shook 
hands, kissed, and at least 
feigned making up when it 
was all over. 

When it was all over, Dale 
Grimsrude and Paul Baci- 
galupi had each reached base 
three times, Tim Murphy had 
a perfect day at the plate, and 
the Pirates had, in the words 
of one player, “chicken- 
scratched our way” to a 9-3 
win. 

While some were chicken- 
scratching, the Rainbow Roos 
and the Huffin Puffins “sleep¬ 
walked” through a 12-10 game 
the ended with the Roos on 
top. “We had 11 players, they 
had nine. If they’d had two 
more players to score, it prob¬ 
ably would have ended in a 
tie,” said one Roo. 

A tie was something the 
Corral wouldn’t settle for as 
they beat the Pendulum Bucs 
for the second time this sea¬ 
son in extra innings. With 
two outs, Michael Vetter 
knocked home Brad Dilorio 
for the 5-4 victory. 

Valiant Comeback 

A valiant comeback effort 


by the Rossi Meats/LYRIC 
team fell short, as they lost to 
the Mint, 18-14, and the Ele¬ 
phant Walk couldn’t cash in 
on their loaded-bases come¬ 
back effort either, as they fell 
to the Rawhide Sentinels, 8-5. 
Despite the loss, Elephant 
Walk manager Jim Smithey 
was pleased with his team’s 
play and confident that the 
squad’s improvement puts 
them in line to peak at the 
upcoming Pendulum Classic. 

Meanwhile, Rawhide plans 
for the Gay World Series. Af¬ 
ter dropping their first four 
games, the Rawhide has 
climbed to the .500 mark by 
winning five of their last six 
games. This week it was 
Frank Edison lighting up the 
scoreboard with a three-run 
homer, his second homer in 
as many games. 

Sweet Inspiration was on a 
sweep inspiration this week 
as they collected a forfeit 
from the Pilsner Penguins 
and then let their bats do 
their talking as they romped 
over the Eagle, 22-7. SI pitch¬ 
er Terry Brooks was helped 
by Greg Newman’s three-run 
blast and Joe Schwab’s down- 
in-the-dirt defense. 

Despite Dr. Silverman’s 
abilities to cover left field 
while playing shortstop, Sil¬ 
verman Chiropractic was shut 
out by Cassidy’s Cabin-ettes. 
The Cabin-ettes also downed 
Group Therapy, 9-2. Slugger 
Mark Fielder unleashed a 
homer in the Cabin-ettes’ first

Team SF Meeting Saturday 


by Rick Thoman 

Team San Francisco will 
be holding an important gen¬ 
eral membership meeting this 
Saturday, June 15, at 3:30 p.m. 
The meeting will be held at 
the Eureka Valley Communi¬ 
ty Center, 100 Collingwood 
Street in San Francisco. 

Many issues directly relat¬ 
ing to participation in the 
New York Gay Games in 
1994 will be discussed, and it 
is hoped that representatives 
from all sports organizations 
will attend. All Team San 


Francisco members are en¬ 
couraged to participate. 

The TSF board of direc¬ 
tors will present their concept 
for a point system which is 
being set up to help TSF 
members with the costs of the 
1994 Games. The point sys¬ 
tem will be based on partici¬ 
pation in the TSF organiza¬ 
tion. 

Team San Francisco is 
hoping to house all TSF ath¬ 
letes in one hotel for the 1994 
Gay Games, and with that in 
mind, the Travel and Housing 
Committee has arranged a 


special hotel package with a 
major New York hotel. The 
hotel information, along with 
a special rate for airline travel 
to the 1994 Games, will be 
presented at the meeting. 

Also on the agenda: 
fundraising activities, includ¬ 
ing participation in this year’s 
Gay Freedom Day Parade, 
and the feasibility of TSF 
hosting a sports festival in 
1992 or 1993. 

For more information 
about the meeting or other 
TSF activities, call (415) 626-

Making Use of Your Dreams 


by Dianne Aaronson 

W hen I was a child, 
my father used to 
ask me each 
morning what I 
had dreamt about. Being an 
innocent, I’d enthusiastically 
recite my adventure from the 
previous night. It didn’t take 
me long to figure out from 
his response, however, that 
dreams are a private and 
wonderful thing, a gateway to 
the soul — or the psyche, if 
you like. 

For sharing my dreams 
with my father, I was often 
rewarded by a lengthy, total¬ 
ly off-the-wall (I thought) and 
often insulting interpretation 
greatly influenced by Freud, 
whom my father worshipped 
as God. I resented this intru¬ 
sion, and little by little I di¬ 
vulged less and less until my 
answer in the morning was, “I 
can’t remember.” 

Then, as I also do now, I 
preferred to protect my frag¬ 
ile self from random and pos¬ 
sibly hurtful (however well- 
meaning) misinterpretation. 
Judging by the number of 
friends who no longer re¬ 
member their dreams, it is 
clear to me that many of us 
have, for one reason or anoth¬ 
er, trained ourselves to forget 
in our conscious hours our ex¬ 
periences while asleep. 

Useful Dreams 

It is believed that we 
dream four or five dreams 
per evening, the last being the 
longest. It is also considered 
natural to remember our 
dreams, and it has been sug¬ 
gested that to remember less 
than one dream per day or 



Dreams can be used as a means to self-exploration and prob¬ 
lem solving; it is useful to write them down. 

(Photo: Rick Gerharter) 


two is likely a sign of pur¬ 
poseful forgetting. What an 
alarming revelation! 

There are useful ways to 
deal with daily dream reports 
however. A Malaysian people 
known collectively as the 
Senoi are able to teach their 
children positive lessons 
through the use of dreams. 
Remembering is expected, 
with reporting in the morning 
as much a part of their rou¬ 
tine as brushing our teeth is 
to us. 

Senoi children are encour¬ 
aged to face their fears by 
confronting them in their 
dreams. Therefore, a report 
of being chased by a tiger 
would be followed by a 
parental suggestion that next 
time this dream occurs the 
child should turn around and 
face the tiger (dream tigers 
being less dangerous than 
waking tigers). A child who 
has a fear of falling might be 


encouraged next dream to en¬ 
joy the sensations of flying, 
and so on. 

Considered to be among 
the most well-adjusted people 
on this earth, the Senoi have 
a highly cooperative, creative 
and peaceful culture with a 
marked absence of neuroses. 
They are considered emotion¬ 
ally mature. Although there 
apparently are no well-con- 
trolled studies that prove 
their approach to dreaming is 
the basis for the Senoi’s well¬ 
being, enough scholars be¬ 
lieve this is likely the case to 
have prompted closer review 
of their culture. 

There is much we can do 
with dreams, and dreams 
come in many shapes and 
sizes. Personally, I have al¬ 
ways distinguished between 
what I call “real dreams” and 
“dream dreams.” The latter 
are the type we’re most famil-

New Stars at Women's Tourney 


For the first time in its 
eight-season history, there 
were no clearly established 
stars on hand to dampen the 
hopes of the 16 women who 
gathered at The Great Enter¬ 
tainer last Saturday to deter¬ 
mine the four who would 
earn invitations to play in 
West Coast Challenge XXIII 
next month. No players in the 
field had ever finished higher 
than fourth and many were 
playing in their first Women’s 
Qualifier, one in which the 
window of opportunity would 
never be more agape. 

Standing in at No. 1 seed 
was Teresa Oliver, her 33-14 
regular season record topping 
the field. She would prove 
that her strong showing in 
this year’s Eight-Ball Champi¬ 
onship was no fluke by tro¬ 
phy round with consecutive 3- 
0 wins over Celeste Schulz, 
Kim Kinker and Mary Ar- 
mentrout. 

Armentrout’s 34-16 season 
record earned a No. 4 seed¬ 
ing, and she started with wins 
over Julia Vax and Laura 
Phillips before her loss to 
Oliver sent her to the losers 
bracket one win shy of the 
trophy round. 

Cathy Sutton had twice 
finished fourth in the contest 
and drew third seeding. She 
would hand consecutive de¬ 
feats to Jodie Baron and Edna 
Magana before battling past 
Marquita Booth, 3-2, to land 
in the final four. 

Anyone who’s witnessed 
Marquita Booth’s softball 
skills would admire her 


exquisite athleticism, and she 
brings that same poise and fo¬ 
cus to the pool table. Her 27- 
12 season record led all scor-, 
ers on the quarterfinalist play¬ 
off team, Cinch Weesedso, 
and garnered her second 
seeding. She started with 
wins over Lisa Lewis, 3-2, and 
Lisa Radler, 3-0, before being 
rerouted to the losers bracket 
by Cathy Sutton. Once there 
only Susu Reiter blocked her 
final four entry, Reiter falling 
in a 3-0 sweep. 

Big Surprise 

With the top three slots 
filled, just one spot remained 
as fourth-seeded Armentrout 
faced the contest’s big sur¬ 
prise, Susana Montana, the 
lowest-rated player in the 
field playing in her first major 
tournament in her first league 
season. Montana would au¬ 
thor a 3-0 shocker and throw 
a subsequent scare into Booth 
before falling, 3-1. 

Not realizing the implica¬ 
tions of her fourth-place finish 
she exclaimed, “You mean I 
get a trophy for this?” 

Teresa Oliver would claim 
winners bracket control with 
a 3-1 win over Cathy Sutton, 
setting up another Sutton- 
Booth confrontation in the 
losers bracket final. Booth 
had the advantage of confi¬ 
dence and momentum as she 
won the rematch, 3-1, to ad¬ 
vance to the finals. 

Oliver had run up a 12-1 
tournament record, but the fi¬ 
nal match momentum was all 
Marquita’s as she dealt out 


consecutive 3-1, 3-1 defeats to 
the top seed. Besides trophies 
all four will be offered trans¬ 
portation and lodging for next 
month’s West Coast Chal¬ 
lenge, hosted by San Diego. 

Weevils Wait 

The top-rated Park Bowl 
Weevils swept their best-of- 
three match playoff semifinal 
series vs. Rams Need Head 
Too last week by 9-2 and 9-5 
scores. The Rams Head team 
seemed a different bunch in 
the second match as they kept 
pace with the Weevils at 4-4 
and 5-6 before losing the last 
three games of the match. 
They’ll play the loser of the 
White Swallow-Overpass 
match for third place this 
week. 

Home-table advantage has 
been the apparent difference 
in the semifinal series be¬ 
tween Swallow Spitters and 
Overpass Underworld with 
Underworld battling for a 9-7 
win at home in their first 
meeting and the Spitters 
breezing to a 9-3 victory at 
home last Thursday. The win¬ 
ners of this week’s confronta¬ 
tion will play at Park Bowl 
on Tuesday, June 18, in the 
City Championship Series. 

The league’s most presti¬ 
gious All-Star Tournament 
will be played on Saturday at 
The Great Entertainer at 
11:30 a.m. and will send its 
top four finishers to open in¬ 
dividual competition at WCC.

did the same in the second. 
Pitcher Angel Olmeda owned 
the day collecting more 
strikeouts than anyone cares 
to keep stats on. 

In the absence of league 
standings and in the hope we 
might have them next week, 
here’s a few choice comments 
from this week’s play: “It’s a 
lonely job coaching third base 
for this team,” according to a 


Group Therapy third-base 
coach who wished not to be 
identified. From one whose 
accent might give her away, 
“I’ve been watching too much 
cricket to say anything useful 
about softball.” From a team 
huddle, “Ask not what you 
can do for the other team, but 
what... .” And mediocre play¬ 
er Louise Merrick said, “I 
want to see my name in 
print.” 

Next week play returns to 
Rossi Field, with two games 
scheduled for Christopher 
Field. T

Exciting Defense 
In Flag Playoffs 


by Kathy Ober 

The San Francisco Women’s 
Flag Football League semi¬ 
finals concluded this past Sun¬ 
day, June 9. Defense was the 
watchword of the day. In the 
first game We Came to Play 
and The Untouchables played 
a tight defensive game, result¬ 
ing in a scoreless first half. We 
Came to Play opened up the 
third quarter with a 50-plus 
yard touchdown pass from 
quarterback Maureen Hogan 
to Lois Spivey. We Came to 
Play went on to score three 
more touchdowns for a final 
score of 25-0. 

In the following game, the 
second-place Rebels and the 
third-place Hot Flash had an 
expectedly intense competi¬ 
tion. The first quarter was 


scoreless, with Hot Flash scor¬ 
ing in the second quarter with 
a short pass to CJ. The Rebels 
came back to score in the se¬ 
cond half on a short pass to 
Michelle Brodie. With the 
score tied 6-6, the teams found 
themselves in an exciting sud¬ 
den death overtime. While 
both teams played intensely, 
Hot Flash pulled it out with a 
screen pass to Ann Lowery 
who then ran 60-plus yards to 
score the winning points. 

The championship game be¬ 
tween We Came to Play and 
Hot Flash gets underway at 
10:30 a.m., Sunday, June 16, at 
Franklin Square (16th & 
Bryant streets).

the fall season can call

Dreams 

(Continued from previous page) 

iar with — surreal, bizarre, 
perhaps disjointed, metaphor¬ 
ical in nature, deserving of in¬ 
terpretation. The former I 
consider to be another layer 
of reality. 

When I “leave my body” or 
“astral travel,” I may be in a 
dream state, but I (or a part of 
me, anyway) am doing these 
things. For instance, I used to 
be an avid runner. In the 
habit of having “real dreams,” 
I often dreamt I’d just been 
running. It always seemed so 
real — I’d be running in the 
dark, watching the stars, see¬ 
ing familiar places. 

One time I “dreamed” I 
was running along a stretch 
of land with water on both 
sides, running parallel to the 
Golden Gate Bridge. Impossi¬ 
ble, I thought upon waking. 
However, I was intrigued 
with the incongruent logistics 
and decided to investigate. I 
discovered (and personally 
visited for personal verifica¬ 
tion) that I had been running 
on Treasure Island — a place 
I’d never set foot on in wak¬ 
ing hours. This type of 
dreaming or “seeing,” as it is 
referred to in the Don Juan 
books of Carlos Casteneda, is 
quite common among many 
Native American tribes. 

Another class of “real 
dreams” known as lucid 
dreaming is common to most 
people not just Native Amer¬ 
icans. I’m sure most of you re¬ 


member a time when, in the 
middle of a dream, you be¬ 
came conscious (while still 
sleeping) and realized that 
you were dreaming. Some 
are lucky enough to be able 
to fully awake, realize they 
liked the dream and wish to 
return, and do so. 

Write Them Down 

Dreams can be used as 
tools for self exploration, 
problem-solving, creative pro¬ 
jects, but first we must re¬ 
member them. The first step 
in remembering them is wrif- 
ing them down! It is so easy 
to not bother, or put it off till 
later (by which time the 
dream’s often been lost). 

There is also a tendency 
not to bother if only a frag¬ 
ment is remembered rather 
than a cohesive whole. Trust 
that if the fragments are 
recorded that eventually the 
whole will follow. 

In the next issue I will dis¬ 
cuss more specific techniques 
for recording and using 
dreams. In the meantime, buy 
yourself a book with blank 
pages that has been designat¬ 
ed as your dream journal. 
Keep it by your bed so that it 
is readily available if you re¬ 
member a dream upon wak¬ 
ing. Ask yourself before 
falling asleep to remember 
your dreams. You’ll be de¬ 
lighted and amazed at what 
follows.

meantime: Creative Dream¬

The Beat 


Second Time Around 


by David Taylor-Wilson 

T he advent of the com¬ 
pact disc brought 
with it more than just 
the superior sound of 
digital audio and ease of oper¬ 
ation. Once we surrendered 
to the silver disc, we found 
ourselves shelling out twice 
as much money as for a vinyl 
album. For those of us who 
were buying CD versions of 
old favorites, it wasn’t unusu¬ 
al for the CD to be four times 
as much as the original. 

The biggest gripe I’ve 
about the increased cost con¬ 
cerns the “greatest hits” al¬ 
bums. Because of. the time 
limitations of vinyl, in a lot of 
releases the shorter singles, or 
“radio versions” of songs, 
were used. But when these al¬ 
bums were reissued on CD, 


most of them were not remas¬ 
tered to include the original 
full-length versions of the 
songs. All the while, the peo¬ 
ple behind the CD technology 
kept touting the fact that it 
could store just over 72 min¬ 
utes of music. So there I was 
paying $14 for a CD that was 
only half full. Highway rob¬ 
bery. 

Now, however, many la¬ 
bels are reissuing classic al¬ 
bums that have been out of 
circulation for quite some 
time. Most of the reissues 
that we’ve previewed take ad¬ 
vantage of the CD’s time 
availability and include addi¬ 
tional songs that were record¬ 
ed during the original ses¬ 
sions and never before re¬ 
leased; or they include alter¬ 
nate takes of certain songs; or 
(drum roll, please) they in-

elude full-length versions of 
the songs. 

The other reissue method 
is actually a repackaging 
method in which the compa¬ 
nies are compiling all-new 
“greatest hits” series called 
“retrospectives.” The record 
companies must be congratu¬ 
lated for the extensive liner 
notes and photographs includ¬ 
ed in most of these packages. 

In other words, now 
they’re more than worth their 
price. 

Here’s a look at some re¬ 
cent releases that fall into 
these categories. 

Compilation Favorite 

Our current favorite is the 
Soul Hits of the 70s — Didn’t 


It Blow Your Mind? series, 
which chronologically tracks 
the biggest American soul 
hits of the ’70s. We told you 
about the first five volumes a 
few months ago, now Rhino 
Records has released another 
five. Present and accounted 
for are “(If Loving You Is 
Wrong) I Don’t Want to Be 
Right” by Luther Ingram, 
“Superfly” by Curtis May- 
field, “Everybody Plays the 
Fool” by The Main Ingredi¬ 
ent, “Theme From Shaft” by 
Isaac Hayes, “Drowning in 
the Sea of Love” by Joe Si¬ 
mon — and so much more. 

Fabulous Retrospective 

As long as we’re talking 
about Rhino, you should 
know about a fabulous retro¬ 
spective that was recently is¬ 
sued: The Isley Brothers Sto¬ 
ry. It comes in two volumes 
sold separately. 

The first volume looks at 
the early years of this incred¬ 
ible group from New Jersey. 
It always amazes me when 
people find out that it was the 
Isleys who originally recorded 
such classics as “Twist and 
Shout” and “This Old Heart 
of Mine.” 

Volume 2 spans the years 
from 1969 to 1985 and under¬ 
standably takes up two discs. 
It had been a long time since 


The Beat had heard “Fight 
the Power,” which dealt with 
“the powers that be” and may 
have been the first time the 
word “bullshit” was used by a 
major black group on a radio 
single. 

The Capitol-EMI family 
has also jumped on the reis¬ 
sue bandwagon. With the ex¬ 
tensive back catalog of mate¬ 
rial they have in their collec¬ 
tive vaults, the forthcoming 
treasures are highly anticipat¬ 
ed. Out now is a beautiful 
collection of big band and 
swing music by Nat King 
Cole entitled Big Band Cole. 
Backed by the legendary 
Count Basie Band and the 
Stan Kenton Band, the vel¬ 
vety smooth vocals of Cole 
are still the epitome of suave 
stylings and sophisticated 
crooning. 

Exciting Reissue 

From 1963 comes Yester¬ 
day’s Love Songs, Today’s 
Blues by the incomparable 
Nancy Wilson. This exciting 
reissue also has Ms. Wilson 
backed by a big band. Need 
we tell you that she swings 
the beat here like no one can? 
For those of you who trea¬ 
sure your original vinyl al¬ 
bum of this recording, take 
note: this CD reissue contains 
five bonus tracks. ▼

PLEASURE TORTURE 

Even if you are a complete beginner I can teach you how to 
relax into new pleasures. No marks, no fluid exchange, no 
crude caricatures of power and masculinity, just slow, sensual, 
creative and safe pleasure-torture. If you’ve been curious 
about bondage and sensual S&M go ahead and ‘‘risk’’ a call 
to a great teacher. I’m short, built (5' 7", 1601bs, 29w, 42c, 16a) 
handsome, dominant, and experienced, but relaxed.

Mr. Marcus 


Drummer Goes to 
The Cocoanut Grove 


M ark your leather cal¬ 
endar now for the 
Mr. Southern Califor¬ 
nia Drummer contest 
the weekend of July 19 and 20. 
The event will be staged on 
Friday and Saturday nights 
and the $95 package will en¬ 
sure you a reserved seat, T- 
shirt, a cocktail party and other 
goodies. Friday night’s event 
will be the jockstrap competi¬ 
tion and the Drummer Boy 
contestants at the Circus Disco. 

In the past several weeks, 
there have been preliminary 
contests in Los Angeles (Mr. 
Los Angeles Drummer), Pom¬ 
ona (Mr. Inland Empire Drum- 
mer), Palm Springs (Mr. 
Desert Empire Drummer), 
Long Beach (Mr. Long Beach 
Drummer, June 16) and Mr. 
San Diego Drummer (July 5-6), 
which will yield 10 semifinal¬ 
ists for the Mr. Southern Cali¬ 
fornia Drummer title and five 
for the Southern California 
Drummer Boy title. 

Tickets can be obtained by 
calling (818) 362-5886 and can 
be charged to your VISA or 
Mastercard. No mail orders 
will be accepted. The Friday 
night only ticket is $15 and the 
Saturday night only ticket is 
$35. The Saturday night finals 
(fantasies and speeches) will be 
held at the world-famous and 
newly refurbished Cocoanut 
Grove (Ambassador Hotel), a 
first-ever gay event at that 
venue. A 12x24-foot Leather 
Pride Flag is being sewn 
together at this very moment 
and will fly on the roof of the 
Grove that night! The five-digit 
budget will produce a land¬ 
mark event that may even out¬ 
shine the Mr. Drummer Finals 
here in September. 

It should be one of those not- 
to-be-missed leather events, so 
if you want to witness another 
“first,” order your tickets now. 
The Cocoanut Grove may be 
grand but it’s not that big. 

It’s even rumored that a ma¬ 
jor female star will perform. 
And as stated before, “And we 
had to settle for Fresno?” What 
happened to the entrepreneur¬ 
ial spirit in Northern Califor¬ 
nia? By the way, the contest is 
a benefit for the Los Angeles 
Homestead Hospice. 

★ ★ ★ 

Another South of Market 
milestone this Sunday, June 16. 
One of the Miracle Mile’s 
longest running class acts — 
the Stud — celebrates their 
25th anniversary. Before the 
economic gluttony of the ’80s 
became apparent in our neigh¬ 
borhood, the Stud long held 
court on Folsom. It started out 
as a country/western type bar, 
then with the deluge of gay 
flower children migrating to 
Haight Street the gays con¬ 
verged on the Stud and it has 
been one of the few manifesta¬ 
tions of gay and straight co¬ 
existence of long standing. 
The Stud is now on the corner 
of Ninth and Harrison, site of 
the now defunct Arena. 

The management of the 
Stud has always been quietly

Bare Chest Calendar, chosen last Thursday, June 6.

working for the betterment of 
the community. They don’t 
make big noises about their 
contributions and they have 
contributed a lot to the com¬ 
munity — stuff you’ll probably 
never hear about. They decor¬ 
ate imaginatively, always get 
noipinated for Cable Car 
Awards and diligently attend 
the ceremonies — always out¬ 
voted by people who attend 
and vote for the mainstream 
bars. Finally, the board of 
directors of Cable Car Awards 
recognized their years of ef¬ 
fort, numerous nominations 
without winning and bestow¬ 
ed a Board of Directors special

calendar. Mr. November ’92 
will be chosen on Thursday, 
June 20 at 2200. See you there? 

Saturday night, Grant Du¬ 
pont, Mr. Watering Hole, 
managed to drag in a healthy 
crowd for his Tattoo Contest. A 
lot of leather celebs on hand 
with 14 male contestants and 
one female. It was a festive eve¬ 
ning that raised almost $1000 
for the AIDS Emergency 
Fund and Women Embracing 
Life. Miss Lupe and Mr. Gene 
won the prizes and Ando of the 
Cal Eagles was the male 
runner-up. 

Sunday, a lot of people 
visited the Haight Street Fair 
and the San Jose Gay/Lesbian 
Parade, but a big crowd on 
hand at the Eagle for Leather 
Daddy’s Boy Mark Sponsel- 
ler’s Torn Jeans Contest. They 
raised $1210 for the Human 
Rights Commission and a lot 
of fun was had by all. When it 
was all over, John Bruening 
(who said he learned every¬ 
thing he knows about stage 
presence from Jerry Coletti) 
won the $69 prize (and donated 
it back!) and the first runner-up 
was handsome Robin Carlson 
of the Trusted Servants MC. 
The brown bag Daddy’s Boy 
lunch was a big hit — everyone 
was playing with the banana 
which was included. 

It was gratifying to see our 
leather title holders at work 
and raising money. Two more 
examples of leather pride. 


What’s coming your way? 
Lots more, believe me. To wit: 

Weekend, June 14-16: SF 
GDIs weekend run, “Wild, 
Wild West.” At this late date, 
it’ll cost you $90 and lots of fun 
activities on this one.

Contest in Portland at the PDX 
Eagle all weekend. Friday, 
meet the contestants at 2100; 
Saturday, the contest ($10) and 
brunch on Sunday at C.C. 
Slaughter’s. $18 for the whole 
weekend to benefit Esther’s

Idol Gossip 

Belated happy 30th birthday 
to Ms. San Francisco Leather 
I, Shadow Morton, last Friday, 
June 7. Shadow dear, did you 
enjoy Sky’s surprise for you? 
Did you enjoy being kidnap¬ 
ped from your job, gagged and 
blindfolded and ending up at 
SFO? Were your boss and co¬ 
workers wrecked when you 
were bodily carried off the job? 
And arriving at the gate bound 
for Hawaii? And did you get 
lei’d? I hope you both had fun! 
Two more leather people who 
work hard for the community. 

Chuck Slayton, owner of the 
former Chaps Bar, had some 
new black on black t-shirts 
made with the world-famous 
Chaps logo imprinted and if 
you send him two checks for 
$7.50 each (one for the cost and 
one made out to the AIDS 
Emergency Fund) you can be 
the first on your block to own 
one. Send both checks to 
Chuck Slayton, do Hartford, 
1929 Market St., SF, CA 94103. 


Do it today. 

Yes, Joe Hollinger and I are 
speaking! Who said we 
weren’t? The Leather Pride 
Float this year will be hot. We 
need your input and a few 
more bucks to complete the 
project. Call 923-9811 or

time, money and energy!

Out/Look 

(Continued from page 35) 

With what in common, I 
asked? “I haven’t a clue,” he 
laughed. “That’s what the de¬ 
bates are about.” 

The three panels offer the 
promise of a real exploration 
of the issues, something 
which the ever-increasing 
hardening of our community’s 
cultural arteries has not 
heretofore permitted or en¬ 
couraged. If the format is suc¬ 
cessful, says Lindsay, the 
foundation hopes to sponsor 
two or three series a year. 

Editor’s note: The Homo- 
Social debates take place in 
the Green Room, War Memor¬ 
ial Building, Van Ness and 
McAllister streets. For more 
information, phone the Out/- 
Look Foundation at 626-7929. 


'Jungle 

Fever'

restaurant and Halle Berry as 
Gator’s drug-addict girlfriend 
Vivian. 

The script, and Lee’s film 
technique throughout, shows 
the talent and maturity of an 
artist who is finally coming 
into his own. One of the high¬ 
lights of the whole film is the 
“war council” scene where 
Drew, Vera and a few friends 
sit around and lament the cur¬ 
rent status of black men and 
dating in America in a semi- 
improvised, no-holds-barred, 
bead-reading discussion that 
leaves no stone unturned. 

Jungle Fever is easily one 
of the best films that I’ve seen 
this year. It raises questions, 
and hopefully will begin a dis¬ 
cussion, about so many sub¬ 
jects that have, until now, 
been taboo. It’s a shame that 
we’ve had to wait so long to 
be provoked into discussing 
these issues, but we can be 
thankful that we have a tal¬ 
ented filmmaker like Lee 
around to so creatively and 
entertainingly goad us into 
doing it. ▼

women might just as well be 
selling spermicide as far as 
I’m concerned! 

Michael Bronski’s Culture 
Clash argued the existence of 
a gay sensibility back in 1984, 
and so it’s our turn now to 
consider the possibilities of 
and for a lesbian one. Do the 
images we’re creating and 
consuming reflect the rich¬ 
ness of our lesbian communi¬ 
ty? Does lesbian visibility in¬ 
clude women of all sizes, 
races, and ages? Are we pre¬ 
senting ourselves in the wide 
range of gender spanning 
from femme to butch that our 
sisters embrace? 

Acknowledging Sexism 
Within Gay Culture 

While we are quick to ac¬ 
knowledge that internalized 
homophobia may be a by- 


Is equality 
what we want 
to strive for? 
It seems to 
me that 
lesbian 
liberation 
is the 

independence 
to create our 
own set of 
values. 

product of living in a hetero¬ 
sexist culture, we shy away 
from addressing the sexism 
we feel within gay culture. It 
feels potentially divisive to 
announce that we don’t want 
to be “like the guys.” But if 
sexism is a reed element of 
gay culture, even if it is our 
own internalized sexism born 
of such overwhelming appre¬ 
ciation of maleness by gay 
male culture, then what be¬ 
comes of an eroticism emerg¬ 
ing from a culture that has 
been influenced by both An¬ 
drea Dworkin and Tom of 
Finland?! 

As an individual who has 
been moved by the contents 
of both off our backs and On 
Our Backs, when presented 
with lesbian erotica, I often 
second-guess my emotional 
responses. I am struck by 


how many images, both visu¬ 
al and linguistic, turn me on, 
and how many of them don’t. 

Is the objectification of les¬ 
bians by other lesbians any 
better or any worse than the 
objectification of women by 
men? Is there any way to 
know when the sensibility 
shaping an image of lesbian 
sexuality is actually governed 
by the same oppressive clut¬ 
ter shaping the heterosexist 
pornography? 

Recently, a club video 
screen was playing a poolside 
scene of two women having 
sex. I realized that all the 
women around me, about a 
dozen in all, were giggling at 
the film. Not sexy, heated 
laughter, but laughingaf the 
film. When I asked if anyone 
thought we were watching 
two lesbians, a burst of laugh¬ 
ter erupted. The giggling 
could be explained by the 
film’s failure to convince us 
that we were seeing ourselves 
on screen. To a woman, we 
agreed that the film consisted 
of two straight women per¬ 
forming at the direction of a 
straight man. 

I love the growing visibili¬ 
ty of lesbians, and our sexual¬ 
ity is a part of who we are, no 
doubt. Certainly many of the 
images of our culture grow 
out of a more complex con¬ 
text than I am framing them 
in here. I know that when I 
see men in drag I can usually 
feel the difference between 
those parodying women and 
those parodying gender roles 

— and that distinction is high¬ 
ly significant. It is the differ¬ 
ence between reaching a new 
height by stepping on some¬ 
one else and reaching a new 
height while bringing those 
around to that same new 
height. 

How can women find a so- 
called equal way to advertise 
“Suck party, those hung over 
8" free, others $5”? It’s impos¬ 
sible to deny differences in 
the way men and women 
look for partners through per¬ 
sonal ads. I’m not looking to 
end anyone’s fun, or even to 
censor it. Since when do 
brothers and sisters have to 
agree on everything to be a 
family? I’m just wondering if 
the lesbian communities are 
going to create a culture 
based on new sensibilities or 
if we are going to content 
ourselves by keeping up with 
the Joneses. 

I for one am not eagerly 
awaiting a Jack Off Club. Oh, 
I don’t deny anyone’s right to 
do so, and no doubt we’ll 
cleverly call it a Jill Off Club 

— but that’s not the revolution 
I want to dance. ▼
