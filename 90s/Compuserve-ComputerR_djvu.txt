Company  Description 

CompuServe,  founded  in  1969,  provides 
remote  computing,  electronic  mail,  database 
access,  internal  communications,  systems 
integration,  value-added  network  services, 
and  software  products  to  more  than  900  major 
U.S.  corporations  and  government  agencies. 
The  company  also  provides  on-line 
information  and  communications  services  to 
more  than  four  million  individual  personal 
computer  owners  worldwide. 

• The  CompuServe  Information  ServiceSM 
(CIS),  the  company’s  flagship  product,  offers 
traditional  on-line  services  and  integrated 
Internet  access  for  consumers. 

• Through  SPRYNETSM,  CompuServe  also 
provides  a standalone  Internet-access-only 
service. 

CompuServe  has  operated  as  a wholly-owned 
subsidiary  of  H&R  Block,  Inc.  since  it  was 
acquired  in  May  1980. 

• In  April  1996,  H&R  Block  made  an  initial 
public  offering  of  16  million  shares  (17.7%) 
of  CompuServe  common  stock.  Upon 
completion  of  the  offering,  H&R  Block  will 
own  at  lease  80%  of  CompuServe  and  will 
continue  to  have  operating  control  of 
CompuServe. 

• H&R  Block,  based  in  Kansas  City  (MO),  is  a 
diversified  services  company  that  primarily 
provides  tax  preparation  and  on-line 
information  services. 

• H&R  Block  reported  total  revenue  of  $1.36 
billion  and  net  income  of  $107.3  million  for 
fiscal  1995. 


On  August  1,  1995,  CompuServe  announced  a 
series  of  investment  initiatives  designed  to 
enhance  long-term  competitiveness,  take 
advantage  of  accelerating  growth 
opportunities,  and  enhance  market  share  for 
its  on-line  services. 

• They  include  the  launch  of  WOW!,  a 
consumer  on-line  service  targeted  to  the 
home  market;  a simplified  and  less 
expensive  pricing  structure;  a new  CIS 
interface;  increased  expenditures  for 
marketing  and  infrastructure  expansion; 
and  the  expansion  of  Internet  access 
through  CIS,  WOW!,  and  SPRYNET. 

• These  initiatives  are  expected  to  reduce 
profitability  during  the  next  12  to  24 
months. 

Organization  and  Structure 

CompuServe  operates  primarily  through  two 
divisions: 

• The  Interactive  Information  Services 
Division  provides  worldwide  on-line  and 
Internet  access  services  for  consumers.  CIS 
serves  more  than  four  million  personal 
computer  users  and  a host  of  financial  and 
business  products  to  companies. 

• The  Network  Services  Division  provides 
local-  and  wide-area  networking  services, 
including  frame  relay,  commercial  Internet 
services,  management  and  applications, 
remote  LAN  access  and  electronic  mail  to 
more  than  900  major  corporations  and 
government  agencies  worldwide.  The 
division  provides  the  infrastructure  that 
supports  CIS  and  SPRYNET. 

In  addition  to  its  world  headquarters  in 
Columbus  (OH),  CompuServe  has  offices  in 
Bristol  (England),  Munich  (Germany),  and 
Paris  (France).  The  company  also  has

network  sales  offices  in  29  cities  throughout 
the  world. 

CompuServe  maintains  three  physically 
distinct  and  remote  data  centers  in  the 
Columbus  (OH)  vicinity. 

Company  Strategy 

CompuServe’s  goal  is  to  lead  in  the 
development  and  implementation  of  personal 
and  commercial  applications  with  computer- 
based  interactive  technology. 

The  company  intends  to  aggressively  grow  its 
subscriber  base  for  consumer  on-line  and 
Internet  services,  to  expand  its  market 
position  in  the  corporate  networking  sector, 
and  continue  to  seek  opportunities  to  increase 
the  value  of  the  new  medium  of  computer- 
based  interactive  technology  to  individuals 
and  corporations.  Key  components  of  this 
strategy  include: 

• Substantial  investments  in  subscriber 
acquisition  and  retention,  including 
marketing,  distribution,  customer  support 
and  services  to  attract  and  retain 
subscribers 

• Targeted  service  offerings,  including 
differentiated  on-line  and  Internet  services 
to  appeal  to  subscribers’  varied  interests 
and  comfort  levels  with  computer 
technologies 

• Accelerated  international  expansion, 
focusing  efforts  on  Western  Europe  where  it 
has  a leading  market  position  and  existing 
infrastructure  and  where  it  believes  the 
potential  exists  for  the  most  significant 
international  growth 


• Increased  value-added  network  services  to 
differentiate  itself  from  more  commodity- 
oriented  network  providers 

• Expansion  and  enhancement  of  network 
infrastructure,  by  expanding  geographic 
coverage,  increasing  bandwidths  and 
deploying  native  TCP/IP  protocols 

• Business  synergies,  leveraging  its  network 
and  host  server  infrastructure  across  all  of 
its  businesses  to  reduce  time  to  market  and 
exploit  cost  advantage;  and  cross-selling  by 
the  sales  force 

The  company  has  diversified  its  business  with 
the  acquisition  of  SPRY,  investments  in 
Network  Publishing,  Inc.,  a Provo  (UT) 
provider  of  World  Wide  Web  publishing 
services;  and  investments  in  Terisa  Systems, 
a provider  of  encryption  and  other  security 
solutions  to  facilitate  safe  commercial 
transactions  on  the  Internet. 

Financials 

CompuServe’s  revenue  for  the  nine  months 
ending  January  31,  1996  reached  $578 
million,  a 38%  increase  over  $418.7  million  for 
the  same  period  in  1995.  Net  income  was 
$50.2  million,  down  from  $67.2  million  for  the 
same  period  a year  ago.  A financial  summary 
is  shown  on  the  following  page. 

• Fiscal  1995  revenue  reached  $582.8  million, 
a 36%  increase  over  fiscal  1994  revenue  of 
$429.9  million.  Net  income  was  $8.8 
million,  down  from  $62. 1 million  for  fiscal 
1994. 

• Net  income  for  fiscal  1995  was  negatively 
impacted  by  a $83.5  million  charge  for 
purchased  research  and  development  in 
conjunction  with  the  acquisition  of  SPRY  in 
April  1995.

Revenue  Analysis  by  Product  / Service 
A summary  of  CompuServe’s  business  mix  is 
shown  on  the  following  page. 

• Interactive  Information  Services  revenue 
is  generated  primarily  from  subscribers 
paying  a monthly  membership  fee  and 
charges  based  on  usage,  as  well  as  from 
fees  received  from  a licensee  and 
distributors  of  CompuServe’s  on-line 
service  technology. 

• Network  Services  revenue  is  generated  by 
providing  value-added  global  network 
interconnectivity  and  access  services  to 
individuals  and  major  corporate  customers 
internationally.  Pricing  is  based  on  terms 
negotiated  as  to  price  and  duration. 

Other  revenue  consists  primarily  of 
processing  services  provided  to  certain 
corporate  customers  and  network  services 
provided  to  H&R  Block. 


Results  for  the  first  nine  months  of  fiscal 

1996  were  due  to  the  following: 

• Interactive  Information  Services  revenue 
increased  45%  over  the  same  period  a year 
ago,  primarily  the  result  of  the  increase  in 
the  subscriber  base. 

- The  number  of  CIS  subscribers  as  of 
January  31,  1996,  exclusive  of 
NiftyServe  subscribers,  increased  more 
than  66%  over  the  same  period  a year 
ago. 

- The  average  monthly  CIS  revenue  per 
subscriber  decreased  to  $17.16  for  the 
first  nine  months  of  1996,  from  $19.34 
for  the  same  period  in  the  prior  year. 
This  was  due  to  a price  reduction 
implemented  in  February  1995  and  the 
new  pricing  structure  introduced  in 
September  1995. 

• Network  Services  revenue  increased  34% 
and  the  number  of  customers  increased 
nearly  33%  to  928.  Revenue  increases

CompuServe  Incorporated

were  due  to  the  increased  number  of 
customers  and  higher  usage  by  existing 
customers. 

• Other  revenue  decreased  14%  due  to  the 
absence  of  the  gains  reported  in  the  prior 
period,  including  $2.0  million  from  the 


Collier- Jackson  sale  and  $1.1  million  from 
H&R  Block  Tax  Services  for  development 
of  tax  preparation  software.  These 
amounts  were  partially  offset  by  a $2.4 
million  gain  on  the  sale  of  a minority- 
interest  investment  in  1996.

CompuServe  management  attributes  fiscal 

1995  results  to  the  following: 

• Interactive  Services  revenue  increased 
48%  due  primarily  to  the  increase  in  the 
number  of  subscribers.  Revenue  growth 
during  fiscal  1995  and  fiscal  1994  was  due 
to  the  growth  in  Information  and  Network 
Services’  revenues.  The  number  of  CIS 
subscribers,  exclusive  of  NiftyServe, 
increased  59%  to  2.2  million  from  1.4 
million  in  1994.  The  average  monthly 
revenue  per  subscriber  in  fiscal  1995  was 
$19.17,  compared  to  $19.35  in  fiscal  1994. 

• The  Information  Services’  worldwide 
customer  base  of  the  company  and  its 
affiliates  grew  to  approximately  3.2 
million  as  of  April  1995,  compared  with 
1.9  million  as  of  April  1994  and  1.2  million 
as  of  April  1993. 


• Network  Services’  revenue  increased  35%. 
The  number  of  customers  increased  nearly 
27%  to  743  as  of  April  1995,  compared 
with  586  as  of  April  1994  and  484  as  of 
April  1993. 

• Other  revenue  decreased  27%  primarily 
due  to  the  sale  of  Collier-Jackson. 

• Record  earnings  were  primarily  due  to  the 
continued  strong  performance  of  the 
Information  and  Network  Services 
divisions. 

CompuServe  has  begun  a number  of 
marketing  and  capital  expenditure 
programs  that  will  require  substantial 
amounts  of  capital  over  the  next  few  years. 
The  company  expects  to  spend 
approximately  $180  million  in  1996  (up 
400%  over  1995)  for  subscriber  acquisition 
and  marketing;  $216  million  in  1996  and 
$186  million  in  1997  for  capital

expenditures;  and  $200  million  for  full 
deployment  of  TCP/IP  across  its  network 
over  the  three  years  beginning  in  1997.

from  clients  in  the  banking  and  finance, 
high  technology,  retail,  information  services,

Geographic  Markets

31,  1996  was  derived  from  the  U.S.  and  22%

Strategy 


The  Systems  Integration  Group,  was  formed  in  September  1991  to 
sell  and  support  LAN  systems  and  provide  WAN/LAN 
interconnections. 

The  Support  Services  Division,  provides  systems  engineering, 
product  development,  computer  operations  and  associated  support 
services  to  CompuServe's  other  units. 


As  of  April  1993,  CompuServe  had  approximately  1,600  employees. 


CompuServe  is  considered  a "utility"  on-line  service,  offering  something 
for  all  personal  computer  owners.  The  strategic  focus  of  the 
Information  services  division  during  fiscal  1993  was  to  strengthen 
CompuServe's  position  against  new  services  that  have  added  significant 
competition  to  the  market,  including  America  Online  and  the  on-line 
service  offered  by  Apple  Computer  called  eWorld. 

In  order  to  support  CompuServe's  leadership  position,  the  company 
continues  to  announce  changes  to  its  Standard  Pricing  Plan.  In  a 
January  1994  announcement,  CompuServe  effectively  reduced  hourly 
connect  time  charges  by  40%. 

In  addition  to  changes  in  its  pricing  structure,  CompuServe  has 
introduced  simplified  access  to  its  on-line  service  by  introducing  user 
interface  software  compatible  with  Microsoft's  Windows  operating 
system.  A key  element  in  membership  growth  is  the  CompuServe 
Information  Manager  (CIM)  software  included  in  most  CompuServe 
membership  kits.  The  software  is  bundled  with  selected  brands  of 
modems  and  installed  on  the  hard  disk  drives  of  several  major  brands 
of  personal  computers.  More  than  one-half  million  copies  of  CIM 
software  had  been  distributed  during  fiscal  1993. 

CompuServe  also  continue  to  expand  access  for  electronic  mail  users. 

In  February  1994,  CompuServe  announced  an  agreement  with  Lotus 
Development  Corporation  to  allow  the  4.5  million  users  of  cc:Mail 
quick  access  to  other  electronic  mail  users  worldwide,  through  the 
CompuServe  Mail  Hub.  In  addition  to  CompuServe's  1.3  million  users, 
the  hub  also  serves  other  CompuServe-linked  systems,  including  the 
Internet,  Novell  NetWareMHS,  Lotus  Notes,  MCIMail,  SprintMail, 
AT&T  Mail,  AT&T  EasyLink,  Infonet,  Deutsche  Bundespost  and  the 
NIFTY-Serve  service.

Assessment 

In  March  1992,  CompuServe  joined  the  ranks  of  consumer  on-line 
services  moving  to  flat-rate  pricing.  The  flat-rate  pricing  strategy 
should  be  an  important  revenue  generator  for  CompuServe  because  it 
puts  the  entire  membership  on  monthly  flat-rate  pricing,  generating 
revenue  of  more  than  $6  million  per  month. 

CompuServe  has  also  added  new  services  to  entice  the  consumer  user 
- and  added  new  business  services  to  expand  its  offering  for  enterprises. 

CompuServe's  challenge  will  be  to  continue  to  develop  its  Windows- 
based  software  to  meet  the  challenge  of  the  new  GUI  interface  offered 
by  competitors  like  America  Online. 

CompuServe  has  also  stepped  into  the  Lotus  Notes  accessibility  issues 
early,  working  with  WALNUT,  the  worldwide  Note  User  group  to  offer 
Notes  implementations  on-line. 

Finally,  CompuServe  continues  to  rethink  the  expansion  of  its  products 
offerings.  To  support  the  use  of  personal  computing  devices, 
CompuServe  is  considering  offering  archival  data  storage  on  its  public 
network.  AT&T  has  been  the  first  to  announce  AT&T  PersonalLink 
Services  will  provide  subscribers  with  storage  capabilities  and 
CompuServe  is  looking  at  a similar  plan.

Continued  revenue  growth  is  attributed  to  the  CompuServe 
Information  Services  and  Network  Services  operations.  For  fiscal 
1991,  revenues  increased  from  all  sources  except  Commercial 
Services  (data  base  access  and  timesharing),  which  reported  a 10% 
decrease. 

• Lower  margins  in  fiscal  1991  (19.3%)  as  compared  to  fiscal  1990 
(19.5%)  resulted  primarily  from  lower  earnings  from  the 
Software  Products  Division,  which  were  affected  by  a sluggish 
economy. 

Revenue  for  the  three  months  ending  July  31,  1991  reached  S65.8 
million,  a 19%  increase  over  $55.2  million  for  the  same  period  in 
1990.  Pretax  earnings  for  the  quarter  rose  nearly  6%,  from  $ 1 1.5 
million  to  $12.1  million. 

Recent  acquisitions  made  by  CompuServe  include  the  following: 

• In  May  1991,  CompuServe  acquired  SEARA  Information 
Strategy  Corporation  of  McLean  (VA). 

- SEARA,  with  approximately  20  employees  at  the  time  of  the 
acquisition  and  annual  revenue  of  $3  million,  provided  local- 
area  network  (LAN)  systems  integration  services  to  legal 
firms,  large  corporations,  real  estate  firms,  international 
organizations,  and  financial  institutions. 

- The  operations  of  SEARA  have  been  merged  into

• In  August  1990,  CompuServe  acquired  Dallas-based 
MicroSolutions,  Inc.,  a reseller  of  local-area  network  (LAN)  and 
connectivity  products. 

- MicroSolutions'  operations  contributed  $18.2  million  to 
CompuServe's  fiscal  1991  revenue. 

- The  operations  of  MicroSolutions  have  been  merged  into 
CompuServe's  Systems  Integration  Group. 

CompuServe  currently  is  organized  into  the  following  divisions: 

• The  Information  Services  Division,  with  400  employees,  provides

• CompuServe's  fiscal  1985  revenue  and  pretax  margin  increases  resulted  from 
exceptional  growth  in  revenue  in  the  individual  consumer  market  that

incremental  costs. 

• Subscribers  to  CompuServe's  Consumer  Information  Service  increased  60%  to 
200,000  subscribers  as  of  April  30,  1985.  New  videotex  products  and 
enhancements  offered  to  the  consumer  marketplace  include  the  following:

information  were  added  to  the  information  services  system,  and 
financial  and  investment  information  data  bases  were  expanded.

THE  COMPANY 

• Until  May  1980,  CompuServe  Inc.  was  a publicly  held  remote  computing 
company.  Effective  May  12,  CompuServe  merged  into  Cl  Corporation,  a 
subsidiary  of  H & R Block  Inc.  CompuServe  will  retain  its  original  name. 

• CompuServe's  total  revenues  increased  24%  from  1978  to  1979,  while  net 
income  increased  80%  during  the  same  period.  A summary  of  CompuServe's 
revenues  prior  to  the  merger  follows:

• CompuServe's  management  explains  that  its  revenue  increase  resulted  from 
higher  sales  to  private-sector  customers  and  an  expansion  of  its  private-sector 
customer  base.  Average  revenues  per  customer  were  approximately  $29,000. 

• CompuServe  had  approximately  700  clients  in  1979.  Eighty-seven  of  those 
clients  accounted  for  roughly  72%  of  revenues.  Government  contracts 
represented  approximately  21%  of  revenues,  including  a contract  with  the  U.S. 
Postal  Service,  which  of  itself  accounted  for  9%  of  CompuServe's  revenues. 

• During  1979,  two  long-term  contracts  were  secured. 

The  first  was  a two-and-one-half-year  contract  with  the  Census  Bureau 
of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce,  worth  $1.6  million. 

The  second  was  a three-year  subcontract  worth  $2.5  million  to  provide 
teleprocessing  support  services  to  Chicago  Aerial  Survey,  a division  of 
American  Appraisal  Associates,  Inc. 

• In  June  1980,  Tandy  Corporation  began  marketing  a new  service  based  on  its 
TRS-80  personal  computer.  The  device,  called  the  TRS-80  Videotex,  will  turn 
any  home  telephone  and  television  set  into  an  information  retrieval  system. 

CompuServe  is  offering  CompuServe  Information  Service  as  part  of 
Videotex.  The  Videotex  user  has  the  option  of  accessing  CompuServe's 
MicroNET  from  his/her  local  telephone.  MicroNET  offers  program 
timesharing,  electronic  mail,  software  sales  and  exchange  through  the 
system. 

Available  programs  include  File  Generator  and  Editor,  Basic, 
Fortran,  APL,  Pascal,  Fintol  (a  financial  problem  solver),  Micro- 
Quote  (a  stock  quote  service)  and  a variety  of  computer  games. 

CompuServe  management  has  high  expectations  for  this  product. 

• There  are  348  CompuServe  employees  divided  by  function  as  follows: 


Marketing  sales  68 

Software  services/customer  support  191 

Computer  operations  43 

General  and  administrative  46 


Total  348 


• CompuServe  management  considers  its  main  competition  to  stem  from  vendors 
of  in-house  systems.  In  addition,  ADP  and  Data  Resources,  Inc.  compete  with 
CompuServe.

COMPUTER  HARDWARE  AND  SOFTWARE: 

9 DEC  PDP  10s,  with  customized  operating  system 
Over  $7,000,000  has  been  invested  in  hardware. 

OVERALL  ASSESSMENT  AND  TRENDS:  A young  and  aggressive  company,  Compu- 

Serv  has  enjoyed  consistent  and  diversified  growth  since  it  was  founded 
in  1969  as  a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  ILEX  Corporation.  (During  1975 
Compu-Serv  went  public  and  stock  was  issued  to  ILEX  shareholders.  ILEX 
opted  to  concentrate  its  activities  in  auto  leasing  and  life  insurance. 
Annual  sales  in  1972  were  $1.9  million,  in  1973  they  were  $3.9  million 
and  $7.2  million  in  1974.  At  this  rate,  sales  should  reach  $24  million 
by  1980.  The  company  has  been  concentrating  on  general  purpose  appli- 
cations. As  it  expands  however,  it  will  become  necessary  to  develop 
more  proprietary  applications  and  to  identify  the  new  sources  of  capi 
tal  requirements  that  will  be  needed.

THE  COMPANY 

• Compute!  Systems  Ltd.  was  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  Canada  in  1967. 
Since  its  inception,  Computel  has  provided  a range  of  computer  services  to 
clients  in  government,  industry  and  education.  Clients  use  Computel  either  to 
supplement  their  own  computer  services  or  to  provide  their  total  computer 
services. 

• In  1973  Computel  became  associated  with  Royal  Trusco,  Limited  which 
presently  owns  96%  of  Computel's  shares  and  contributes  for  36%  to 
Computel's  revenues. 

• The  consolidated  operations  of  Computel  Systems  Ltd.  includes  six  separate 

operating  subsidiaries:  Computel,  Data  Logic  Canada,  Dominion  Computer 

Support  Services,  Computel  Systems  Inc.  (Florida),  the  new  Computel  Saudi 
Arabia  operations,  and  a recently  acquired  company,  SDI  Associates  Ltd. 

• While  total  revenues  for  1978  increased  45%  from  1977  to  1978,  net  income 
for  the  same  period  decreased  41%.  A five  year  financial  summary  follows:

• In  March,  1978  final  approval  was  given  Computel  by  the  Board  of  Governors 
of  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserve  Board  for  the  divestiture  of  Information  Systems 
Designs,  Inc.  (ISD),  the  wholly-owned  California  subsidiary  which  provides 
remote  computing  services. 

• Computel's  management  claims  that  the  lower  1978  profits  were  attributable 
to:  the  exclusion  in  1978  of  profits  from  Information  Systems  Designs,  Inc. 
and  from  costs  associated  with  the  expansion  of  the  Florida  subsidiary.  Other 
contributing  factors  were: 

The  election  of  a progressive  conservative  Government  in  Canada  which 
has  significantly  cut  back  spending.  Since  75%  of  Computel's  non- 
captive revenues  stem  from  the  Canadian  Federal  Government,  the 
present  leadership  has  had  a negative  impact  on  Computel's  business. 
Computel  is  attempting  to  expand  its  commercial  business  and  that 
expansion  has  been  slower  than  anticipated.  Management  does  not 
expect  to  see  an  improvement  in  its  commercial  business  until  the  first 
quarter  of  1 980. 

• In  August,  1979  Computel  acquired  SDI  Associates  Ltd.  from  London  Life 

Insurance  Company.  SDI  Associates  specializes  in  product  development, 
processing,  and  software  products  for  financial  institutions:  commercial 

banks,  trust,  and  mortgage  companies.  SDI  had  revenues  of  approximately 
$7.5  million  for  1978.  Computel  management  intends  to  develop  strength  in 
providing  processing  and  professional  services  for  financial  institutions,  in 
addition  to  marketing  SDI's  software  products.

for  systems  management  across  all 
platforms.  Virtually  every  major  hardware 
vendor  and  many  software  vendors  have 
endorsed  CA-Unicenter. 

Company  Description 

Computer  Associates  International,  Inc.  (CA) 
was  incorporated  in  1974  and  commenced 
operations  in  1976.  As  a result  of  ongoing 
internal  development  and  numerous 
acquisitions,  the  company  currently  markets 
and  supports  more  than  500  systems  and 
applications  software  products  worldwide. 

CA’s  product  line  includes  systems  and 
database  management,  application 
development,  financial  and  manufacturing 
applications  and  consumer  solutions  for  use  on 
mainframe,  midrange  and  desktop  computers. 
The  company  serves  business,  government, 
scientific  and  educational  organizations 
through  direct  operations  in  36  countries. 

Organization  and  Structure 

In  North  America,  CA’s  sales  and  support 
personnel  are  currently  organized  into  the 
following  groups: 

• The  North  American  Group  is  responsible 
for  sales,  marketing  and  service  of  products 
sold  directly  to  the  user. 

• A separate  National  Accounts  Group 
provides  additional  service  to  large  clients, 
including  users  and  facilities  managers.  The 
Federal  Division  markets  and  supports 
federal  government  clients. 

• The  Third-Party  Sales  Group  is  responsible 
for  sales,  marketing  and  service  of  CA’s 
software  products  through  third-party 
authorized  vendors. 

CA  operates  approximately  55  offices 
throughout  the  U.S.  in  addition  to  its 
headquarters  in  Islandia  (NY). 


Outside  North  America,  CA  operates  through 
wholly  owned  subsidiaries  located  in  33 
countries  and  operates  62  foreign  office 
facilities  outside  the  U.S.  Principal  offices  are 
located  in  Argentina,  Australia,  Austria, 
Belgium,  Brazil,  Canada,  Denmark,  Finland, 
France,  Germany,  Holland,  Hong  Kong, 
Ireland,  Israel,  Italy,  Korea,  Malaysia,  New 
Zealand,  Norway,  the  Philippines,  Portugal, 
Russia,  Singapore,  South  Africa  (with 
Dimension  Data  Holdings  Ltd.),  Spain, 
Sweden,  Switzerland,  Taiwan,  Turkey  and  the 
U.K. 

Company  Strategy 

CA’s  strategy  is  to  provide  its  clients  with 
corporate-wide  software  solutions  through 
internal  development,  technology  acquisition 
and  extensive  product  integration.  Its 
software  solutions  are  designed  to  help  clients 
evolve  to  client/server  and  distributed 
computing  across  desktop,  midrange  and 
mainframe  computers. 

This  is  accomplished  through  adherence  to 
CA’s  unique  software  blueprint — CA90s®: 
Computing  Architecture  For  The  90s.  This 
layered  architecture  is  the  blueprint  for  the 
continuing  development  of  all  CA  software, 
which  enables  clients  to  choose  the  hardware 
platform  of  their  choice,  or  even  a combination 
of  hardware  platforms,  based  upon  their 
distributed  or  cooperative  processing 
requirements.  As  a result,  the  company  is 
able  to  provide  enterprise-wide  solutions. 

Though  CA’s  mainframe  business  currently 
accounts  for  approximately  68%  of  sales,  CA’s 
president  Charles  Wang  has  been  quoted  in 
the  computer  industry  press  describing  CA’s 
target  revenue  mix  otherwisein  the  next  five 
years.  This  revenue  mix  would  be  25% 
mainframe  product  revenues,  25%  personal 
computer,  25%  UNIX  and  25%  other 
environments.

INPUT  Vendor  Profile 


During  fiscal  1995,  product  revenue  increased 
by  31%  to  $1.9  billion. 

• The  increase  was  attributed  to  greater 
revenue  derived  from  licensing  fees  on  the 
midrange  platform  as  well  as  modest 
increases  in  product  revenue  from 
mainframe-based  systems  management 
products.  The  midrange  platform  increase 
was  due  chiefly  to  the  success  of  the 
company’s  UNIX-based  systems 
management  product — CA-Unicenter — as 
well  as  integration  of  the  ASK/Ingres 
products  acquired  in  June  1994. 

• The  continued  demand  for  Enterprise 
Licensing  alternatives  and  less  restrictive 
pricing  options  affording  clients  licensing 
flexibility  also  contributed  to  revenue 
growth. 

• International  revenues  increased  by  28% 
during  fiscal  1995.  This  increase  was 
positively  affected  by  foreign  exchange 
currency  rates,  relatively  stable  economic 
conditions,  expanding  markets  and 
favorable  product  offerings. 

Maintenance  revenues  in  fiscal  1995 
increased  4%  to  $719.6  million,  primarily  due 
to  the  acquisition  of  ASK.  Absolute 
maintenance  revenue  continued  to  be 
negatively  impacted  by  site  consolidations 
and  the  revenue  mix  shift  toward  lower 
maintenance-generating  client/server 
solutions. 

Revenue  Analysis  by  Product  / Service 
INPUT  estimates  that  more  than  71%  of  CA’s 
fiscal  1995  revenue  was  derived  from 
software  product  licenses,  27%  from 
associated  maintenance  services  and  the 
remainder  from  professional  services. 


Approximately  73%  of  fiscal  1995  revenue 
came  from  mainframe-based  software  and 
services,  20%  from  midrange  systems  and  the 
remaining  7%  from  micro  and  other  software. 

Interim  Results 

Revenue  for  the  nine  months  ending 
December  31,  1995  reached  nearly  $2.4 
billion,  a 31%  increase  over  $1.82  billion  for 
the  same  period  in  1994. 

• Net  losses  of  $321.5  million  include  pretax 
write-offs  of  $1.3  billion  for  purchased 
research  and  development  associated  with 
the  acquisition  of  LEGENT.  This  compares 
with  net  income  of  $219  million  for  the 
same  period  a year  ago,  which  includes 
write-offs  of  $249.3  million  for  purchased 
research  and  development  associated  with 
the  acquisition  of  The  ASK  Group. 

• Excluding  these  charges,  CA  reported  net 
income  of  $486.6  million,  up  from  $373.6 
million  for  the  same  period  a year  ago. 

Market  Financials 

CA’s  products  are  used  by  clients  in 
manufacturing,  banking,  insurance, 
education,  government  agencies,  retail 
microcomputer  distribution  and  value-added 
reselling,  as  well  as  by  individual  personal 
computer  users. 

Geographic  Markets 

Approximately  48%  of  CA’s  fiscal  1995 
revenue  was  derived  from  the  U.S.  (including 
export  sales)  and  52%  from  international 
sources.

Company  Strategy 

CA's  strategy  is  to  provide  its  clients  with 
corporate  wide  software  solutions  through 
internal  development,  technology  acquisition  and 
extensive  product  integration.  Its  software 
solutions  are  designed  to  help  clients  evolve  to

client/server  and  distributed  computing  across 
desktop,  midrange  and  mainframe  computers. 

This  is  accomplished  through  adherence  to  CA’s 
unique  software  blueprint — CA90s®: 

Computing  Architecture  For  The  90s.  This 
layered  architecture  is  the  blueprint  for  the 
continuing  development  of  all  CA  software, 
which  enables  clients  to  choose  the  hardware 
platform  of  their  choice,  or  even  a combination 
of  hardware  platforms,  based  upon  their 
distributed  or  cooperative  processing 
requirements.  As  a result  the  company  is  able  to 
provide  enterprise-wide  solutions. 

Though  CA's  mainframe  business  currently 
accounts  for  approximately  75%  of  sales,  CA's 
president  Charles  Wang  has  been  quoted  in  the 
computer  industry  press  describing  CA's  target 
revenue  mix  in  the  next  five  years.  This  revenue 
mix  would  be  25%  mainframe  product  revenues, 
25%  personal  computer,  25%  UNIX  and  25% 
other  environments. 

CA  has  outlined  its  strategy  for  the  products  it 
acquired  in  June  1994  with  The  ASK  Group. 

The  company  intends  to  continue  development 
work  on  the  products  and  to  increase  the  level  of 
support  for  most. 

• New  releases  of  CA-OpenROAD  object- 
oriented,  repository-driven  application 
development  software  will  be  available  in 
1994. 

• Upgrades  for  the  CA-OpenINGRES  database 
server  are  expected  during  the  first  six  months 
of  1995.  CA-OpenINGRES  release  1.1  is 
being  tested  at  more  than  100  beta  sites. 

• The  CA-MANMAN/X  and  CA-KBM 
manufacturing  packages  are  currently  being 
updated  and  at  intervals  throughout  1995. 


• CA  will  create  an  integrated  repository  for 
CA-OpenROAD  and  Windows4GL  (both  from 
ASK),  with  CA’s  C A- Visual  Realia  and  CA- 
Visual  Objects  development  program.  Its 
visual  development  strategy  will  include 
support  for  OLE  custom  controls. 

CA  continues  to  follow  an  aggressive  acquisition 
growth  strategy  to  build  its  product  offerings. 

Financials 

CA’s  fiscal  1994  revenue  reached  nearly  $2.15 
billion,  a 1 7%  increase  over  fiscal  1 993  revenue 
of  $1.84  billion.  Net  income  rose  63%,  from 
$245.5  million  in  fiscal  1993  to  $401.3  million  in 
fiscal  1994. 

A five-year  financial  summary  is  shown  on  the 
following  page. 

During  fiscal  1994,  product  revenue  increased  by 
24%  to  $1.45  billion. 

• The  increase  was  primarily  attributed  to  higher 
licensing  fees  on  the  mainframe  and  midrange 
platforms  and  market  acceptance  of  CA’s 
leading  UNIX-based  product,  CA- 
UNICENTER,  which  currently  operates  on 
several  different  platforms. 

• Enterprise  Licensing  alternatives  and  less 
restrictive  pricing  options  affording  clients 
licensing  flexibility  also  contributed  to  revenue 
growth,  particularly  for  mainframe  systems 
products. 

• International  revenues  increased  by  6%  during 
fiscal  1994.  This  increase,  less  than  the  29% 
achieved  by  domestic  operations,  was 
adversely  affected  by  foreign  currency 
exchange  rates  and  local  economic  conditions 
during  1994,  as  well  as  the  later  introduction 
of  CA’s  UNIX-based  offerings.

Revenue  Analysis  by  Product/Service 

INPUT  estimates  more  than  67%  of  CA’s  fiscal 
1994  revenue  was  derived  from  software 
product  licenses,  32%  from  associated 
maintenance  services  and  the  remainder  from 
professional  services. 

Interim  Results 

Revenue  for  the  six  months  ending  September 
30,  1994  reached  nearly  $1.1  billion,  a 17% 
increase  over  $940.4  million  for  the  same  period 
in  1993.  Net  income  of  $44.8  million  includes  a 
write-off  of  $249.3  million  for  purchased 
research  and  development  associated  with  the 
acquisition  of  The  ASK  Group. 

• Income  before  the  write-offs  reached  $199.4 
million,  a 69%  increase  over  the  prior  year’s 
first  half. 


• All  product  offerings,  particularly  CA’s 
midrange  client/server  products,  performed 
well  in  the  second  quarter.  Midrange 
environment  products  experienced  growth  of 
177%  due  to  continued  strong  acceptance  of 
CA’s  midrange  systems  management 
offering— CA-UNICENTER  for  UNIX. 


In  the  area  of  database  management  systems, 
graphics  and  applications  software  for  the  micro, 
mini  and  mainframe,  the  customer  base  ranges 
from  home  users  to  Fortune  500  companies. 


Market  Financials 

CA’s  products  are  used  by  clients  in 
manufacturing,  banking,  insurance,  education,

Key  Points 


Computer  Associates  International  (CA)  is  the  world's  leading 
independent  software  provider  of  systems  management,  database 
management,  application  development,  and  business  application 
software. 

In  1993,  financial  results  for  the  year  were  better  than  projected, 
reflecting  a turnaround  in  CA's  relationship  with  its  corporate 
customers. 

Financial  results  for  1993  indicate  that  the  erosion  CA  was  facing  in 
its  mainframe  business  has  been  reversed  and  new  sales  are  now 
being  realized  from  the  existing  client  base. 

With  acquisition  of  Nantucket's  Clipper  database  product,  CA 
gained  an  installed  customer  base  estimated  at  500,000.  CA  also  has 
revealed  development  plans  for  the  Clipper  product  line  quelling 
third  party  developer  fears. 

In  February  1993,  CA  announced  reorganization  plans  for  its 
personal  computer  software  sales  department  to  prepare  for  a major 
promotion  of  its  CA-UNICENTER  product  line  directed  at  the 
microcomputer  market. 

Over  90%  of  the  Fortune  and  Forbes  500  companies  use  Computer 
Associates  software.

Description 


Strategy 


Operations/ 

Structure 


Computer  Associates  International,  Inc.  (CA)  was  incorporated  in  1974 
and  commenced  operations  in  1976.  As  a result  of  ongoing  internal 
development  and  numerous  acquisitions,  the  company  currently 
markets  and  supports  more  than  300  systems  and  application  software 
products  worldwide. 

CA's  product  line  includes  systems  management,  database 
management,  application  development,  and  business  applications 
software  for  use  on  mainframe,  midrange,  and  desktop  computers.  The 
company  serves  business,  government,  scientific,  and  educational 
organizations  through  direct  operations  in  26  countries. 


CA's  strategy  is  to  provide  its  clients  with  corporate  wide  software 
solutions  through  internal  development,  technology  acquisition,  and 
extensive  product  integration.  As  part  of  this  strategy,  in  April  1990, 
CA  announced  that  all  of  its  product  development  would  be  in 
conformance  with  CA90s:  Computing  Architecture  for  the  90s. 

This  layered  architecture  is  the  blueprint  for  the  continuing 
development  of  all  CA  software,  which  enables  clients  to  choose  the 
hardware  platform  of  their  choice,  or  even  a combination  of  hardware 
platforms,  based  upon  their  distributed  or  cooperative  processing 
requirements.  As  a result  the  company  is  able  to  provide  enterprise- 
wide solutions. 

Though  CA's  mainframe  business  currently  accounts  for  approximately 
75%  of  sales,  CA's  president  Charles  Wang  has  been  quoted  in  the 
computer  industry  press  describing  CA's  target  revenue  mix  in  the  next 
five  years.  This  revenue  mix  would  be  25%  mainframe  product 
revenues,  25%  personal  computer,  25%  UNIX  and  25%  other 
environments. 

CA  continues  to  follow  an  aggressive  acquisition  growth  strategy  to 
build  its  product  offerings. 


In  North  America,  CA's  sales  and  support  personnel  are  currently 
organized  into  two  groups:  the  North  American  Group  and  the  Third 
Party  Sales  Group.  The  North  American  Group  is  responsible  for 
sales,  marketing,  and  service  of  products  sold  directly  to  the  end-user 
and  the  Third  Party  Sales  Group  is  responsible  for  sales,  marketing, 
and  service  of  CA's  software  products  through  third  party  authorized 
vendors. 

CA  operates  approximately  60  offices  throughout  the  U.S.  in  addition 
to  its  headquarters  in  Islandia,  New  York.

languages. 

• CA  announced  in  June  1992,  the  acquisition  of  privately-held 
Nantucket  Corporation,  a leading  developer  of  dBase/xBase- 
compatible  application  development  systems.  The  acquisition 
significantly  strengthens  CA's  position  in  the  PC  database  market. 

In  May  1991,  CA  combined  its  INFOPOINT  banking  software  product 
line  with  the  business  of  the  Newtrend  Group  in  a joint  venture  that  is 
owned  in  equal  shares  by  CA  and  the  Newtrend  Group.  Newtrend 
continues  to  be  privately  held.

The  Company  Computer  Associates  International,  Inc.  (CA)  was  incorporated  in 

1974  and  commenced  operations  in  1976.  As  a result  of  ongoing 
internal  development  and  numerous  acquisitions,  the  company 
currently  markets  and  supports  more  than  300  systems  and 
application  software  products  worldwide.  CA's  product  line 
includes  systems  management,  information  management,  and 
business  applications  software  for  use  on  mainframe,  midrange,  and 
desktop  computers. 

CA's  strategy  is  to  provide  its  clients  with  corporate  wide  software 
solutions  through  internal  development,  technology  acquisition,  and 
extensive  product  integration.  As  part  of  this  strategy,  in  April 
1990,  CA  announced  that  all  of  its  product  development  would  be  in 
conformance  with  CA90s:  Computing  Architecture  for  the  90s.  This 
layered  architecture  is  the  blueprint  for  the  continuing  development 
of  all  CA  software,  which  enables  clients  to  choose  the  hardware 
platform  of  their  choice,  or  even  a combination  of  hardware 
platforms,  based  upon  their  distributed  or  cooperative  processing 
requirements. 

Fiscal  1991  revenue  reached  nearly  $1.35  billion,  a 4%  increase 
over  fiscal  1990  revenue  of  $1.3  billion.  Net  income  rose  1%,  from 
$157.8  million  in  fiscal  1990  to  $159.3  million  in  fiscal  1991.  A 
three-year  financial  summary  follows:

Revenue  and  net  income  growth  for  fiscal  1991  was  less  than 

anticipated.  Results  were  attributed  to  the  following: 

• During  early  fiscal  1991,  sales  and  support  operations  were 
realigned  to  mirror  clients'  requirements  more  closely  and  the 
company  launched  its  CA90s  strategy.  As  a result,  productive 
time  of  the  sales  force  was  impacted,  having  a negative  effect  on 
the  results  of  the  first  half  of  the  year.  The  last  two  fiscal 
quarters  were  confronted  with  the  war  and  worldwide  economic 
problems. 

• Selling,  marketing,  and  administration  expenses  were  54%  of 
revenue  in  both  fiscal  1991  and  fiscal  1990. 

- Fiscal  1990  results  include  approximately  $30  million  of  one- 
time charges  associated  with  the  acquisition  of  Cullinet  in 
September  1989.  After  adjusting  for  these  one-time  charges, 
selling,  marketing,  and  administrative  charges  increased  by 
2%  of  revenues  in  fiscal  1991  as  a result  of  higher  per  capita 
costs,  promotion  expenses,  and  additions  to  reserves. 

• Product  development  costs  charged  to  operations  were  $177.4 
million  in  fiscal  1991,  compared  to  $171.2  million  in  fiscal  1990. 
During  fiscal  1991,  CA  produced  more  than  30  new  products  and 
enhancements  to  its  existing  products.

Revenue  for  the  three  months  ending  June  30,  1991  reached  $263.2 
million,  a 3%  increase  over  $255.1  million  for  the  same  period  in 
1990.  Net  income  was  $3.67  million , compared  to  net  income  of 
$3.59  million  for  the  same  period  a year  ago. 

• Results  for  the  recent  quarter  do  not  include  revenues  for  the 
month  of  June  from  INFOPOINT  banking  products  or  revenues 
for  the  entire  three  months  from  Japan. 

• Nonetheless,  quarter  revenues  and  net  income  were  lower  than 
expected.  The  results  were  attributed  to  general  economic 
conditions  and  the  deferral  of  buying  decisions. 

Since  1982,  CA  has  completed  over  20  acquisitions,  as  summarized 
in  the  exhibit.  With  the  exception  of  the  Cullinet,  UCCEL,  and 
Capex  acquisitions,  which  were  accounted  for  on  a pooling  of 
interests  basis,  all  of  the  company's  acquisitions  have  been 
accounted  for  by  the  purchase  method.  Recent  acquisition  activity 
includes  the  following: 

• In  September  1991,  CA  announced  a definitive  agreement  to 
acquire  Pansophic  Systems,  Inc.  of  Lisle  (IL)  for  approximately 
$283  million. 

- Pansophic,  founded  in  1968,  provides  CASE,  applications 
control,  and  information  retrieval  and  management  systems 
software  products  for  IBM  mainframes  and  integrated 
manufacturing,  distribution,  and  financial  application  software 
for  IBM  AS/400  systems. 

- Major  products  include  TELON,  Panvalet,  EASYTRIEVE, 
FUSION,  and  Pansophic  Resource  Management  System. 

- Pansophic,  with  approximately  1,600  employees,  had  revenue 
of  $230.2  million  and  net  income  of  $20.6  million  for  its  fiscal 
year  ending  April  30,  1991. 

- The  acquisition  is  expected  to  be  complete  in  October  1991. 

• In  September  1991,  CA  finalized  the  acquisition  of  On-Line 
Software  International,  Inc.  of  Fort  Lee  (NJ)  for  approximately 
$120  million  ($15.75  per  share). 

- On-Line  Software  develops,  markets,  and  supports 
development  tools  and  CICS  and  DB2  systems  software 
products  designed  to  enhance  the  productivity  of  users  of  IBM 
and  compatible  mainframes.  Major  products  include  RAMIS, 
UFO,  and  InterTest.

- On-Line  Software  had  revenue  of  $101.3  million  and  net 
income  of  over  $4.5  million  for  the  fiscal  year  ending  May  31, 
1991  and  currently  has  approximately  660  employees 
worldwide. 

• In  August  1991,  CA  finalized  the  acquisition  of  substantially  all 
the  assets  of  Information  Science,  Incorporated  (InSci)  of 
Montvale  (NJ).  Terms  of  the  purchase  were  not  disclosed. 

- InSci,  founded  in  1965,  provided  human  resource  management 
system  application  software  products  for  IBM  and  compatible 
mainframes. 

- InSci,  with  approximately  120  employees,  had  revenue  of 
$13.7  million  and  net  losses  of  $960,000  for  the  fiscal  year 
ending  April  30,  1990. 

• In  July  1991,  CA  acquired  the  rights  to  license  and  distribute 
OnGuard,  a Tandem-based  security  software  package,  from 
Panoramic,  Inc.  The  product  is  being  marketed  by  CA  as  CA- 
ONGUARD. 

• In  January  1991,  CA  acquired  substantially  all  the  assets  of 
Manageware,  Inc.  and  its  principle  product  Compete!.  Marketed 
now  as  CA-Compete!,  the  product  is  a multidimensional 
financial  modeling  tool  for  the  Microsoft  Windows  environment. 

In  May  1991,  CA  combined  its  INFOPOINT  banking  software 

product  line  with  the  business  of  the  The  Newtrend  Group  in  a joint 

venture  that  is  owned  in  equal  shares  by  CA  and  The  Newtrend 

Group.  Newtrend  continues  to  be  privately  held. 

Recent  announcements  include  the  following: 

• In  August  1991,  CA  and  Tandem  announced  a cooperative 
agreement  whereby  CA  will  develop  systems  management 
software  for  Tandem  NonStop  systems.  The  products  to  be 
developed  will  extend  and  complement  existing  operations 
management  products  provided  by  Tandem  and  its  other 
strategic  software  partners. 

• In  August  1991,  CA  and  Apple  announced  an  agreement 
whereby  CA  will  support  the  Macintosh  computer  as  a strategic 
platform  in  client/server  computing.

The  Company 


December  1990 


Computer  Associates  International,  Inc.  (CA)  was  incorporated  in 
1974  and  commenced  operations  in  1976.  As  a result  of  ongoing 
internal  development  and  numerous  acquisitions,  the  company 
currently  markets  and  supports  more  than  250  systems  and 
application  software  products  worldwide.  CA's  product  line 
includes  systems  management,  information  management,  and 
business  applications  software  for  use  on  mainframe,  midrange, 
and  desktop  computers. 

CA’s  strategy  is  to  provide  its  clients  with  corporatewide  software 
solutions  through  internal  development,  technology  acquisition, 
and  extensive  product  integration.  As  part  of  this  strategy,  in  April 
1990,  CA  announced  that  all  of  its  product  development  would  be 
in  conformance  with  CA  90s:  Computing  Architecture  for  the  90s. 
This  layered  architecture  is  the  blueprint  for  the  continuing 
development  of  all  CA  software,  which  enables  clients  to  choose 
the  hardware  platform  of  their  choice,  or  even  a combination  of 
hardware  platforms,  based  upon  their  distributed  or  cooperative 
processing  requirements. 

In  September  1989,  CA  made  its  second  largest  acquisition  to  date 
with  the  purchase  of  Cullinet  Software,  Inc.  of  Westwood  (MA) 
for  approximately  17.4  million  shares  of  CA  common  stock 
(valued  at  about  $300  million).  The  acquisition  was  accounted  for 
as  a pooling  of  interests. 

• Cullinet  provided  data  base  management  systems  software  and 
manufacturing,  human  resources,  and  distribution  application 
software  products  for  IBM  mainframes  and  DEC  VAX  systems. 
Cullinet's  principal  product  is  the  IDMS  data  base  management 
system. 

• Cullinet  had  revenue  of  $202.9  million  and  net  losses  of  $19.8 
million  for  the  fiscal  year  ending  April  30,  1989.  The 
operations  of  Cullinet  have  been  merged  into  CA.

COMPUTER  ASSOCIATES  INTERNATIONAL,  INC. 


Fiscal  1990  revenue  reached  nearly  $1.3  billion,  a 5%  increase 
over  fiscal  1989  revenue  of  $1.23  billion.  Net  income  rose  21%, 
from  $130.3  million  in  fiscal  1989  to  over  $157.7  million  in  fiscal 
1990. 

• In  the  five-year  summary  that  follows,  financials  have  been 
restated  to  reflect  the  pooling  of  interests  acquisition  of 
Cullinet.  Results  reported  for  years  prior  to  fiscal  1990 
combine  CA's  audited  financials  for  the  year  ending  March  31 
with  Cullinet's  unaudited  financials  adjusted  for  periods  ending 
March  31  (Cullinet's  fiscal  year  end  prior  to  the  acquisition  was 
April  30).

N/A 

Revenue  growth  for  fiscal  1990  was  adversely  impacted  by  the 
protracted  Cullinet  acquisition  process,  as  well  as  the  significant 
management  effort  expended  in  integrating  the  Cullinet  product 
line.  With  these  issues  resolved,  CA  has  refocused  its  resources  on 
profitability  and  growth. 

• Selling,  marketing,  and  administration  expenses,  on  a 
comparable  basis,  grew  to  54%  of  revenue  in  fiscal  1990  from 
51%  in  fiscal  1989. 

• Fiscal  1990  results  include  approximately  $30  million  of  one- 
time charges  associated  with  the  acquisition  of  Cullinet,  as  well 
as  additional  costs  associated  with  raising  the  level  of  client 
service  and  support.

• For  fiscal  1990,  product  development  costs  charged  to 
operations  were  $171.2  million  and  capitalized  costs  were 
nearly  $17  million. 

• Revenue  for  the  six  months  ending  September  30,  1990  reached 
$565.7  million,  a 3%  decrease  from  $585.2  million  for  the  same 
period  a year  ago.  Net  income  grew  55%,  from  $20.3  million  to 
$31.5  million. 

Since  1982,  CA  has  made  over  20  acquisitions,  as  summarized  in 

the  exhibit. 

• With  the  exception  of  the  Cullinet,  UCCEL,  and  Capex 
acquisitions,  which  were  accounted  for  on  a pooling  of  interests 
basis,  all  of  the  company's  acquisitions  have  been  accounted  for 
by  the  purchase  method. 

CA  is  organized  into  four  business  groups  as  follows: 

• North  America  Group  markets  and  supports  CA's  management, 
information  and  business  application  software  products  in 
North  America. 

• The  Asia  Pacific  and  Europe  Groups  market  and  support  all 
CA  software  products  outside  North  America. 

• The  Micro  Products  Division  markets  the  company's 
microcomputer  software  products  in  North  America.

CAI  management  attributes  the  company's  revenue  growth  to  the 
licensing  of  greater  numbers  of  products,  both  developed  and 
acquired. 

Since  1982,  CAI  has  made  15  acquisitions,  as  summarized  in 
Exhibit  A. 

With  the  exception  of  the  Capex  and  UCCEL  acquisitions,  which 
were  accounting  for  on  a pooling  of  interests  basis,  all  of  the 
company's  acquisitions  have  been  accounted  for  by  the  purchase 
method. 

Product  development  costs  charged  to  operations  were 
approximately  $81.5  million  (11%  of  revenue)  in  fiscal  1988,  $64.3 
million  (14%  of  revenue)  in  fiscal  1987,  and  $58.1  million  (18%  of 
revenue)  in  fiscal  1986.  In  fiscal  1988  and  1987,  CAI  also 
capitalized  $7.9  million  and  $7.1  million,  respectively,  of  research 
and  development  costs. 

Revenue  for  the  three  months  ending  June  30,  1988  reached 
$185.7  million,  a 33%  increase  over  $139.3  million  for  the  same 
period  in  1987.  Net  income  for  the  period  was  $16.9  million,  an 
increase  of  83%  over  $9.2  million  for  the  same  period  a year  ago.

THE  COMPANY 

• Computer  Associates  International,  Inc.  (CAI)  was  incorporated  in  1974  and 
now  designs,  develops,  markets,  and  supports  systems  software,  data  base 
management,  and  applications  software  products  for  mainframes,  minicom- 
puters, and  microcomputers. 

• On  August  31,  1982,  CAI  acquired  Capex  Corporation  for  approximately  2.4 
million  shares  of  its  stock,  valued  at  $22.5  million.  Capex,  headquartered  in 
Phoenix,  had  calendar  1981  revenue  of  approximately  $15  million  and  250 
employees  at  the  time  of  acquisition.  The  company,  which  markets  systems 
and  financial  applications  software  running  under  OS  and  MVS,  has  been 
merged  into  CAI.  The  acquisition  was  accounted  for  on  a pooling  of  interests 
basis. 

• CAI's  fiscal  1983  revenue  increased  35%  to  $58.1  million  from  $43.2  million  in 
1982.  Net  income  grew  84%  to  $5.6  million  from  $3.1  million  in  1982.  A five- 
year  financial  summary  follows:

COMPUTER  ASSOCIATES  INTERNATIONAL,  INC. 
FIVE-YEAR  FINANCIAL  SUMMARY 
($  thousands,  except  per  share  data) 


Revenue  increases  over  the  past  several  years  are  attributed  to  an 
increase  in  the  number  of  packages  licensed  and  to  the  expansion  of 
operations  into  new  geographic  markets.  Price  increases  have  not  been 
a material  factor  in  revenue  growth. 

The  increase  in  fiscal  1983  net  income  is  primarily  due  to  a decrease  in 
the  selling,  marketing,  and  administrative  expenses  realized  after  the 
combination  of  the  business  of  Capex  with  the  company. 

• Research  and  development  expenditures  were  $8.6  million  in  fiscal  1983  as 
compared  to  $6.3  million  in  1982,  or  approximately  15%  of  revenue  for  both 
years. 

• Revenue  for  the  nine  months  ended  December  31,  1983  was  $60.5  million,  a 
44%  increase  over  $41.9  million  the  previous  year.  Net  income  for  the  period 
increased  78%  to  $6.7  million. 

• In  April  1983  CAI  declared  a two-for-one  stock  split  effective  May  10,  1983. 
CAI's  June  1983  stock  offering  of  two  million  shares  generated  proceeds  of 
$57.5  million,  to  be  used  as  working  capital  and  for  possible  acquisition  of 
software  products  or  related  companies. 

• CAI  paid  $2.9  million  and  $2.3  million  in  fiscal  1983  and  1982,  respectively, 
for  the  purchase  of  software  products.  In  addition,  the  company  issued  long- 
term notes  payable,  and  in  1983,  issued  54,292  shares  of  stock  valued  at  $1.2 
million.

• Acquisitions  made  in  calendar  1983  include  the  following: 

In  January  1983  CAI  acquired  Stuart  P.  Orr  Associates,  Inc.  of  Pasa- 
dena (CA)  for  an  undisclosed  amount.  Stuart  P.  Orr  is  a developer  of 
financial  applications  software  packages.  Its  operations  have  been 
merged  with  CAI's. 

On  June  30,  1983,  CAI  announced  the  acquisition  of  Information  Un- 
limited Software,  Inc.  (IUS)  for  $5  million  plus  an  additional  $5  million 
to  be  paid  over  a three-year  period.  Headquartered  in  Sausalito  (CA), 
IUS  had  fiscal  1983  revenue  of  about  $5.5  million  and  approximately 
100  employees  at  the  time  of  acquisition.  The  company  markets  busi- 
ness accounting,  word  processing,  and  planning/filing  microcomputer 
software  packages  and  now  operates  as  a separate  division  of  CAI 
under  its  original  name.  IUS  is  expected  to  contribute  an  estimated  $7 
million  to  CAI's  fiscal  1984  revenue. 

• CAI's  13  foreign  subsidiaries  operate  as  distributors  for  its  products.  Subsid- 
iary offices  are  located  in  Austria,  Australia,  Belgium,  Brazil,  Canada, 
France,  Germany,  Holland,  Italy,  Japan,  Spain,  Switzerland,  and  the  United 
Kingdom. 

• As  of  May  15,  1983,  CAI  had  747  employees,  of  which  126  were  engaged  in 
product  development  efforts  and  402  in  sales  and  sales  support  functions. 
There  are  currently  900  employees. 

• CAI  competes  with  the  following  companies: 

Systems  software  competitors  include  IBM  (sort/merge  packages), 
Syncsort  (sorting  packages),  Tower  Systems  (file  and  disk  space 
management),  University  Computing  (file  management),  Johnson 
Systems  (job  accounting),  and  Cambridge  Systems  Group  (disk  space 
management). 

Principal  competitors  in  the  data  base  management  systems  market 
include  IBM,  Cullinet  Software,  Cincom  Systems,  Software  AG, 
Mathematica,  and  Applied  Data  Research. 

The  major  competition  to  CAI's  new  line  of  financial  applications 
software  comes  from  Management  Science  America  (MSA). 

Competitors  of  CAI's  IUS  microcomputer  software  division  include 
MSA's  Peachtree  Software  subsidiary  and  MicroPro. 

KEY  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

• One  hundred  percent  of  CAI's  fiscal  1983  revenue  was  derived  from  software 
products,  81%  of  which  was  from  product  revenue  and  related  income,  and 
19%  from  maintenance  fees.

• CAI  markets  over  30  systems  software  packages.  Over  29,000  packages  have 
been  installed  for  use  by  15,000  clients.  The  products  run  on  IBM  360,  370, 
303X,  4300,  and  compatible  mainframes  under  DOS,  DOS/VSE,  OS,  OS/MVS, 
CMS,  VM,  and  MVS  (also  MVS/XA  for  all  OS  products).  A listing  of  packages 
is  presented  in  Exhibit  A. 

• The  company's  primary  systems  software  products  include  CA-DYNAM/T, 
CA-DYNAM/D,  CA-OPTIMIZER,  and  CA-SORT.  These  products  represent 
approximately  62%  of  CAI's  installed  base  and  accounted  for  approximately 
66%  of  revenue  for  each  of  the  last  three  fiscal  years. 

CA-DYNAM/T  is  a tape  library  management  product  that  tracks 
current  and  obsolete  tapes. 

CA-DYNAM/D  is  a disk  storage  management  product  that  allocates 
disk  storage  capacity  among  several  programs  that  are  being  executed

optimize  the  performance  of  applications  programs  written  in  COBOL. 

CA-SORT  sorts  data  records  into  desired  sequences. 

• CAI  introduced  several  new  systems  software  products  in  1983. 

CA-UNIVERSE,  introduced  in  April  1983,  is  a relational  data  base 
management  system  written  in  the  C language  and  transportable  across 
various  vendors'  hardware.  It  runs  on  IBM  mainframes  under  DOS 
(VSE),  OS  (MVS),  CMS,  and  VM.  Plans  include  modifying  the  system  to 
run  on  other  mainframes,  minicomputers,  and  microcomputers.  CAI's 
DBMS  sales  for  the  first  nine  months  of  calendar  1983  were  approxi- 
mately $3  million. 

CA-SENTINEL,  introduced  in  June  1983,  is  a security  package  for  both 
on-line  and  batch  processing  at  DOS/VS(E)  sites.  The  product  gener- 
ated $1  million  in  revenue  during  the  June  through  December  1983  six- 
month  period. 

The  CA-DYNAM/CMS  tape  management  family  was  introduced  in  June 
1983.  The  products  consist  of  a VM/CMS  version  of  CAI's  CA- 
DYNAM/T  tape  management  system  and  CA-DYNAM/B,  a flexible 
backup  and  restore  facility  for  the  VM/CMS  environment.

• CAI  applications  software  products,  excluding  those  marketed  by  its  IUS 
division,  include  the  following: 

CAI  markets  financial  and  distribution  management  applications  soft- 
ware, as  presented  in  Exhibit  B.  The  company's  ADVANCED  BUSINESS 
SOFTWARE,  introduced  in  April  1983,  consists  of  two  series  of  inte- 
grated on-line  packages  that  run  on  IBM  and  compatible  mainframes 
and  Data  General  ECLIPSE  computers.  Both  series  are  being  inte- 
grated with  CAI's  CA-UNIVERSE  data  base  management  system. 

. The  Financial  Management  Software  Series  includes  products  for 
general  ledger,  accounts  payable,  customized  financial  report- 
ing, asset  management,  human  resources,  payroll  administration, 
and  budgeting,  forecasting,  and  modeling. 

The  majority  of  the  packages  were  developed  by  Stuart  P. 
Orr  Associates,  a recent  CAI  acquisition,  and  converted 
to  run  on  IBM  mainframes  as  well  as  the  originally  devel- 
oped Data  General  ECLIPSE  environment. 

CA-AUTOTAB,  the  financial  forecasting  and  modeling 
system,  was  acquired  along  with  Capex  and  has  been 
renamed  CA-FINANCIAL  PLANNER. 

The  products  are  also  being  developed  for  use  on  mini- 
computers and  microcomputers  from  DEC  and  IBM. 

. The  Distribution  Management  Software  Series,  which  is  fully 
integrated  with  the  Financial  Management  packages,  is  based  on 
software  acquired  from  American  Computer  Sciences  in  March 
1982.  Packages  include  inventory  control,  order  entry,  sales 
analysis,  and  accounts  payable  and  receivable  for  clients  in  the 
wholesale  distribution  industry. 

CA-LAWFIRM,  introduced  in  August  1983,  is  a law  firm  management 
and  client  accounting  package  designed  to  run  on  the  IBM  System/34  or 
System/36  or  on  the  IBM  PC  in  a network  environment.  A standalone 
microcomputer  version  for  smaller  law  firms  is  being  developed. 

. Functions  include  time  and  disbursement  accounting,  billing,  and 
accounts  receivable. 

. The  system  is  part  of  a new  family  of  law  firm  products,  includ- 

ing conflict-of-interest,  docketing,  and  diary  packages,  as  well 
as  specialized  packages  for  tax,  real  estate,  estates  and  trusts, 
and  patents  and  trademarks. 

In  January  1984  CAI  announced  CA-EXECUTIVE,  a package  of  inte- 
grated software  for  IBM  PC,  PC/XT,  and  compatible  microcomputers 
running  under  PC  DOS.  The  package  includes  an  intelligent  micro-to-

gether with  a window  manager  for  concurrent  processing. 

. CA-DBMS  is  based  on  Micro  Data  Base  Systems,  Inc.'s  Knowl- 
edgeman  source  code,  which  CAI  acquired  in  mid- 1 983.  Micro 
Data  Base  is  located  in  Indiana. 

. CA-EXECUTIVE  can  be  integrated  with  CA-UNIVERSE  and  is 
scheduled  for  introduction  in  April  1984,  priced  at  $1,295. 
Substantial  volume  discounts  will  be  available.  The  product  is 
sold  only  as  a complete  package. 

• CAI  entered  the  microcomputer  applications  software  market  as  a result  of 
its  June  1983  acquisition  of  Information  Unlimited  Software  (IUS).  IUS  has 
sold  over  160,000  packages,  which  are  organized  into  two  software  series,  as 
shown  in  Exhibit  C. 

The  IUS  Productivity  Software  Series  includes  EasyWriter,  EasyFiler, 
EasyPlanner,  EasySpeller,  and  EasyMailer.  These  packages  encompass 
word  processing,  DBMS,  spreadsheet,  mail/merge,  and  spelling-checker 
applications. 

The  IUS  Financial  Management  Series  consists  of  six  subsystems, 
including  General  Ledger  and  Financial  Reporter,  Accounts  Receivable, 
Accounts  Payable,  Order  Entry,  Inventory  Control  and  Analysis,  and 
Payroll. 

• As  of  June  1983,  approximately  56%  of  CAI's  installed  software  package  base 
consisted  of  perpetual  licenses  and  44%  of  fixed-term  licenses. 

One  year  of  maintenance  is  included  in  the  perpetual  license.  Subse- 
quent annual  maintenance  fees  range  from  12%  to  13%  of  the  then- 
prevailing  perpetual  license  fee. 

Fixed-term  licenses  range  from  one  to  three  years,  with  maintenance 
included. 

• Products  are  technically  supported  initially  by  the  field  systems  engineers.  In 
addition,  CAI  maintains  customer  support  centers  in  each  of  its  regional 
offices  in  the  U.S.  and  in  most  of  the  foreign  countries  where  the  company  has 
subsidiaries.  These  centers  provide  technical  support  by  telephone. 

INDUSTRY  MARKETS 

• CAI's  fiscal  1983  revenue  was  derived  from  across  industry  sectors,  primarily 
from  manufacturers,  banks,  insurance  companies,  retailers,  educational  insti- 
tutions, and  government  agencies.

term bank  indebtedness. 

• Revenues  for  fiscal  1981  increased  I 10%  to  $18,456,000.  Pretax  margins  were 
12.5%  versus  1.9%  in  1980.

THE  COMPANY 

• The  Computer  Company  (TCC)  was  formed  in  1968  by  seven  ex-IBM 
employees  to  provide  facilities  management  and  processing  services.  In  April 
1983  TCC  was  acquired  by  Blue  Cross  and  Blue  Shield  of  Virginia  and  now 
operates  as  a wholly  owned  subsidiary.  TCC  provides  Medicaid  claims  proces- 
sing, professional  services,  and  various  other  processing  services. 

• TCC's  annual  growth  rate  for  the  last  five  years  has  averaged  20%.  A five- 
year  revenue  summary  follows:

(a)  In  1984  TCC  changed  its  fiscal  year  to  coincide  with  the  calendar  year  for 
financial  accounting  and  tax  purposes.  As  a result,  the  most  current  revenue 
figure  reflects  a nine  month  period. 


• TCC's  management  attributes  recent  revenue  declines  to  the  loss  of  its 
Louisiana  and  North  Carolina  Medicaid  contracts. 

TCC's  growth  rate  is  expected  to  increase  due  to  the  award  of  three 
major  contracts— Georgia  and  Tennessee  Medicaid  Fiscal  Agent 
contracts  and  the  Pennsylvania  Pharmaceutical  Assistance  Contract 
for  the  Elderly  (PACE).

THE  COMPUTER  COMPANY 


• TCC  is  organized  into  two  divisions  as  follows: 

The  Social  Services  Division  provides  claims  processing  services  and 
accounted  for  $21.7  million  or  80%  of  1984  revenue. 

The  Commercial  Division  consists  of  four  departments:  Interactive 

Data  Base  Systems  (IDS),  Micromedia,  Information  Services  Division 
(IND),  and  Library  Services.  The  Commercial  Division  contributed  $5.6 
million  or  20%  of  1984  revenue. 

• As  of  December  31,  1984,  TCC  employed  862  people,  segmented  as  follows:

As  of  June  30,  1985,  TCC  had  942  full-time  employees. 

m TCC's  competition  for  Medicaid  claims  processing  services  comes  from  Elec- 
tronic Data  Systems-Federal  (EDS-F),  Computer  Sciences  Corporation,  and 
System  Development  Corporation  (Burroughs). 

KEY  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

c Eighty  percent  of  TCC's  total  revenue  is  derived  from  claims  processing 
services,  software  licensing  agreements,  and  development  contracts  managed 
by  the  Social  Services  Division  (Medicaid). 

The  following  Medicaid  contracts  are  currently  held  by  TCC: 

. Delaware  - fiscal  agent. 

. Pennsylvania  - operations  support. 

. District  of  Columbia  - fiscal  agent. 

. Virginia  - fiscal  agent. 

. West  Virginia  - claims  processing. 

. Georgia  - fiscal  agent.

THE  COMPUTER  COMPANY 


In  the  past,  when  TCC  could  not  compete  for  Medicaid  contracts  that 
required  more  resources  (people/machines)  than  TCC  could  provide,  it 
operated  as  a subcontractor  to  other  bidders.  Contractual  agreements 
have  been  made  with: 

. Electronic  Data  Systems  (EDS)  - North  Carolina  Medicaid. 

. Computer  Sciences  Corporation  (CSC)  - California  Medi-Cal. 

. Bradford  National  - New  York  Medicaid  (since  acquired  by 

McDonnell  Douglas  Automation  Company). 

. System  Development  Corporation  (SDC)  - Florida  Medicaid. 

. Hawaii  Medical  Service  Association  (HMSA)  - Hawaii  Medicaid. 

TCC  claims  that  50%  of  all  Medicaid  claims  in  the  U.S.  are  processed 
by  its  Medicaid  Management  Information  System  software  designs. 

• Twenty  percent  of  TCC's  total  revenue  is  derived  from  The  Commercial 
Division's  four  departments.  Interactive  Data  Base  Systems  provided  5%  of 
revenue,  Micromedia  accounted  for  6%,  Information  Services  Division 
accounted  for  5%,  and  Library  Services  Division  provided  4%  of  1984  revenue. 

The  Commercial  Division  is  now  emphasizing  specialized  products  for 
its  network  service  and  is  also  incorporating  microcomputer-based 
systems.  Applications  available  on  TCC's  processing  network  are 
included  in  the  exhibit. 

Interactive  Data  Base  Systems  (IDS)  provides  interactive  computing 
systems,  related  data  bases,  and  services  used  primarily  for  market  and 
financial  analysis,  maintenance  management,  and  APL  programming. 

. IDS  has  been  phasing  out  its  transportation  data  bases,  scien- 
tific/engineering applications,  and  APL  services.  Currently,  IDS 
offers  the  Financial  Data  Exchange  which  allows  a scheduled 
exchange  of  data  among  participating  financial  institutions. 
Data  exchanged  includes  information  on  loans,  deposits,  auto- 
mated teller  transactions,  credit  cards,  and  customer  services. 

TCC's  Micromedia  Group  offers  processing  of  both  computer  output 
microfilm  (COM)  and  source  document  microfilm.  The  Group  produces 
more  than  16  million  original  frames  (16mm  and  105mm)  per  month  and 
more  than  500,000  copies. 

. Micromedia  offers  microfilm  processing  services  for  commer- 
cial, federal,  and  state  clients.  Significant  among  these  clients 
are  the  Virginia,  Georgia,  Tennessee,  Delaware,  West  Virginia, 
and  Pennsylvania  Medicaid  programs.  Micromedia  produces 
more  than  1.8  million  frames  of  source  documents  and  16.5 
million  frames  of  COM  per  month  for  these  customers. 

. TCC's  Micromedia  Group  will  enter  the  small  systems  market  by 
offering  the  service  of  converting  data  output  on  floppy  disk  to 
magnetic  tape  in  order  to  create  microfilm.

THE  COMPANY 

• The  Computer  Company  (TCC)  was  formed  in  1968  by  seven  ex-IBM  em- 
ployees to  provide  facilities  management  and  timesharing  services.  Expansion 
beyond  internal  growth  occurred  through: 

A contract  award  in  1972  to  develop  and  operate  a Medicaid  claims 
processing  system  for  the  State  of  Virginia. 

Acquisition  of  the  Richmond  (VA)  office  of  a microfilm  service  firm  in 
1972. 

Acquisition  of  APL  Services,  Inc.  (a  former  TCC  customer)  in  1974. 

• TCC  currently  derives  the  majority  of  its  revenue  from  Medicaid  processing 
contracts.  Fiscal  1982  revenue  of  $30.4  million  increased  50%  over  1981 
revenue  of  $20.2  million.  TCC's  annual  growth  rate  for  the  last  five  years  has

provided  by  its  Social  Services,  IDS,  and  Commercial  Services  Divisions.  The 
remaining  7%  is  attributed  to  source  document  filming  and  microfilm  equip- 
ment sales  associated  with  the  Micromedia  Division. 

• Seventy-nine  percent  of  TCC's  total  revenue  is  derived  from  processing  ser- 
vices, software  licensing  agreements,  and  development  contracts  managed  by 
the  Social  Services  Division  (Medicaid). 

The  following  Medicaid  contracts  are  currently  held  by  TCC: 

. Delaware-fiscal  agent.

. Virginia-fiscal  agent.

. West  Virginia-claims  processing. 

When  TCC  cannot  compete  for  Medicaid  contracts  because  they  re- 

quire more  resources  than  TCC  can  provide,  it  operates  as  a subcon- 
tractor to  another  bidder.  Contractual  agreements  have  been  made 
with: 

. Computer  Sciences  (California  Medicaid). 

. McDonnell  Douglas  Automation  Company  (formerly  negotiated 
with  Bradford  for  New  York  Medicaid). 

. System  Development  Corporation  (Florida  Medicaid). 

. Electronic  Data  Systems,  Federal  (North  Carolina  Medicaid). 

TCC  claims  that  50%  of  all  Medicaid  claims  are  processed  by  its  Medi- 
caid Management  Information  System  software  designs. 

• TCC's  IDS  Division  revenue  of  $2.7  million  in  fiscal  1982  showed  a decline 
from  $3.4  million  reported  in  1980.  To  compensate  for  losses  in  the  general- 
ized APL  timesharing  market,  TCC  is  now  emphasizing  specialized  products 
for  its  network  service  and  is  developing  several  microcomputer-based 
systems. 

TCC  offers  interactive  computing  systems,  related  data  bases,  and 
services  used  primarily  for  market  and  financial  analysis,  maintenance 
management,  and  APL  programming.  These  on-line  systems  generate 
management  information  used  for  planning,  forecasting,  and  control. 

Specialized  products  marketed  by  IDS  include: 

. Financial  Industry  Services. 

Branch  Data  Exchange:  a semiannual  or  quarterly  ex- 
change of  data  among  participating  financial 

institutions.  Data  exchanged  includes  information  on 

loans,  deposits,  automated  teller  transactions,  credit 
cards,  and  customer  services. 

MIDAS:  an  interactive  system  which  allows  users  to 

define  and  study  specific  market  areas,  based  on  the 
information  in  the  Branch  Data  Exchange.

. Transportation  Data  Bases. 

Comprehensive  data  bases  of  current  and  historical  air 
traffic,  airport  statistics,  airline  financial  statistics,  and 
railroad  data  to  aid  in  market  analysis  and  route 
planning.  TCC  offers  Form  41,  ER-586,  ER-586/T-9, 
Domestic  and  International  Origin  and  Destination, 
Commuter,  and  Interstate  Commerce  Commission  data. 

. APL. 68000  Interpreter  and  Interactive  Software. 

APL.68000  allows  the  use  of  the  APL  language  on  16/32- 
bit  microcomputers  which  incorporate  the  MC68000 
microprocessor.  Because  the  interpreter  is  a full  imple- 
mentation of  ACTION/APL.SV  used  by  the  TCC  time- 
sharing service,  APL.68000  offers  all  the  advantages  of 
interactive  computing  using  the  APL  language,  plus  the 
convenience  to  the  customer  of  having  his  own  machine. 

APL.68000  operates  as  a standalone  system  or  can  be 
connected  to  TCC's  network. 

Other  software  products  which  use  APL.68000  and  are 
available  on  the  network  include:  ARS,  a reporting 

system;  MICRO  PLOT,  a plotting  system;  and  MICRO 
SPAN,  an  APL  self-teaching  course. 

Applications  available  on  TCC's  processing  network  are 
included  in  the  exhibit. 

• TCC's  Micromedia  Division  offers  state-of-the-art  processing  of  both  com- 
puter output  microfilm  (COM)  and  source  document  microfilm.  The  division 
produces  more  than  10  million  original  frames  (16mm  and  105mm)  per  month 
and  more  than  500,000  copies. 

Micromedia  offers  a full  line  of  microfilm  processing  services  for 
commercial,  federal,  and  state  clients.  Significant  among  these  clients 
are  the  Virginia,  Delaware,  West  Virginia,  and  Pennsylvania  Medicaid 
programs.  The  division  produces  more  than  1.8  million  frames  of 
source  documents  and  113,000  frames  of  COM  per  month  for  these 
customers. 

• The  Commercial  Division  offers  a variety  of  data  processing  services  to  a 
diverse  group  of  customers. 

The  Library  Group  uses  a unique  data  management  system  to  handle 
the  large  and  intricate  file  structures  of  library  applications.  The 
system  allows  for  on-line  claiming  of  bibliographic  records  for  retro- 
spective conversion  and  acquisitions,  as  well  as  an  original  cataloging 
module  which  interfaces  directly  with  the  Library  of  Congress'  name

• The  Computer  Company  (TCC)  was  formed  in  1968  by  seven  ex-IBM  employees 
to  provide  facilities  management  and  timesharing  services.  Expansion  beyond 
internal  growth  occurred  through: 

A contract  award  in  1972  to  develop  and  operate  a Medicaid  claims 
processing  system  for  the  State  of  Virginia. 

Acquisition  of  the  Richmond  (VA)  office  of  a microfilm  service  firm  in 
1972. 


A merger  agreement  between  TCC  and  APL  Services  Inc.  (a  former 
TCC  customer)  in  1974. 

• TCC  derives  the  majority  of  its  revenues  from  Medicaid  contracts.  Several 
factors  cause  Medicaid  revenues  to  flow  unevenly: 

There  is  often  a startup  period  of  several  months  during  which  expenses 
are  incurred  but  revenues  are  not  realized  until  the  operations  portion 
of  the  contract  starts. 

Working  as  a subcontractor  often  produces  a lump-sum  payment  at 
contract  milestones  with  relatively  small  revenues  in  between. 

HEW  certification  of  a Medicaid  system  usually  occurs  six  months  after 
a system  enters  production.  Often  there  are  lump-sum  revenues 
associated  with  this  certification. 

• TCC's  FY  1980  revenues  were  $13.7  million,  a 2%  decline  from  FY  1979.  The 
decline  in  revenues  was  attributed  to: 

A one-time  payment  fee  of  $600,000  received  in  1979  upon  certification 
of  the  New  York  Medicaid  contract  and  another  $400,000  in  other 
contract  fees.

• TCC's  competition  in  Medicaid  processing  primarily  comes  from  Electronic 
Data  Systems  and  Blue  Cross/Blue  Shield.  The  APL  Division  competes  with 
I.  P.  Sharp,  STSC  and  Proprietary  Computer  Systems. 

KEY  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

• Approximately  96%  of  TCC's  revenues  are  derived  from  processing  services 
provided  by  its  Social  Services,  APL  Timesharing  and  Commercial  Services 
Divisions.  The  remaining  4%  is  attributed  to  source  document  filming  and 
microfilm  equipment  sales  associated  with  the  TCC  Micromedia  Division. 

• Fifty  percent  of  TCC's  total  revenues  are  derived  from  processing  services, 
software  licensing  agreements,  and  development  contracts  managed  by  the 
Social  Services  Division  (Medicaid). 

The  following  Medicaid  contracts  are  currently  held  by  TCC: 

. South  Dakota  - software  development. 

. North  Carolina  - joint  contract  with  EDS.  TCC  is  processing  the 
pharmacy  claims. 

. Delaware  - fiscal  agent. 

. Maryland  - software  development. 

. Pennsylvania  - operations  support. 

. Virginia  - fiscal  agent. 

. West  Virginia  - claims  processing. 

• When  TCC  can't  compete  for  Medicaid  contracts  that  require  more  resources 
than  TCC  can  provide,  it  operates  as  a subcontractor  to  another  bidder. 
Contractual  agreements  have  been  made  with: 

. Computer  Sciences,  California  Medicaid. 

. Bradford  National,  New  York  Medicaid. 

. System  Development  Corporation,  Florida  Medicaid. 

TCC  claims  that  40%  of  all  Medicaid  claims  are  processed  by  its 
Medicaid  Management  Information  System  software  designs.  The 
federal  government's  medical  program  is  also  using  a nucleus  of  TCC 
software. 

In  addition  to  Medicaid,  government  programs  for  which  the  Social 
Services  staff  has  provided  support  include  the  following:

and  rail  industries,  in  addition  to  air  traffic.  On-line  financial 
and  traffic  data  for  these  industries  allow  an  analyst  to  perform 
a variety  of  statistical  analyses,  such  as  fuel  costs,  traffic  trends 
and  competitive  market  shares. 

AIRMARKET  is  the  largest  revenue-producing  product  on 
TCC's  network.

Revenues,  fiscal  year  end  3/76: 
$6.3  million 


COMPANY  BACKGROUND: 

• The  Computer  Company  (TCC)  was  incorporated  in  Richmond,  Virginia 
in  1968.  Key  founders  were  the  Messrs.  Witschey,  Enfield,  Budette, 
and  Moore. 

• In  January  1974,  the  merger  of  APL  Services,  Inc.,  a major  TCC 
customer,  and  TCC  formed  TCC's  APL  Timesharing  Division. 

• TCC  has  five  divisions.  They  are,  in  order  of  revenue  size: 
Government  Systems  Division,  providing  government  health  care 
services;  the  APL  Timesharing  Division;  the  General  Services 
Division,  offering  local  batch  services;  the  COM  Division, 
providing  computer  output  microfilm;  and  the  Minicomputer  Division. 

OVERALL  ASSESSMENT: 

• TCC  suffered  a net  loss  of  $1,031  in  1975  as  a result  of  two 
events  TCC  considers  one-time  occurrences. 

The  merger  of  APL  Services,  Inc.  with  TCC  in  January,  1974, 
created  substantial  expenses  which  were  carried  over  into 
fiscal  year  1975,  beginning  April  1,  1974. 

In  fiscal  year  1975,  TCC  started-up  and  ended  a turnkey 
minicomputer  application  for  the  dental  industry.  The 
service,  which  was  priced  above  the  targeted  market,  is 
now  successfully  being  offered  to  dentists  on  a time- 
sharing basis. 

The  expenses  of  both  these  projects  were  fully  paid  in 
1975,  and  the  1976  annual  report  showed  a profit  of 
$501,418,  approximately  8%  of  the  1976  revenues.  Fiscal 
year  1977  shows  "substantial  profit,"  to  date,  according 
to  company  sources. 

• Government  health  care  services  have  been  TCC's  major  revenue 
generator.  However,  the  rapid  growth  of  the  APL  Timesharing 
Division  may  soon  make  it  the  biggest  revenue  generator  in 
the  company.

revenues,  provides  Medicaid/Medicard  processing  to  the  State 
of  Virginia. 

• The  other  divisions  offer  batch,  microfilm  and  minicomputer 
services . 

APPLICATIONS:  The  bulk  of  TCC  total  revenues  in  1976  were  generated 

by  specialty  applications  in  the  Government  Systems  Division.  The 
remaining  revenues  were  generated  by  general  business  and  data  base 
applications.  The  bulk  of  the  APL  Timesharing  Division  revenues  were 
generated  by  general  business  applications.  The  remaining  APL 
revenues  came  from  data  base  applications  to  the  airline  and  petroleum 
industries  primarily. 

INDUSTRY  MARKETS:  A breakdown  of  TCC  revenues  by  industry  is  not 

available,  although  the  airlines  and  medical  industries  represent  the 
bulk  of  the  revenues. 

GEOGRAPHIC  MARKETS:  The  vast  majority  of  TCC  total  revenues  were 

derived  from  the  Southeast  U.S.,  specifically  Virginia.  The  remainder 
came  from  throughout  the  U.S.,  except  the  North  Central  region.  The 
major  sources  of  the  APL  Division  revenues  were  the  Southeast,  South 
Central,  and  Northeast  regions.  The  remaining  APL  revenue  sources  were 
scattered  throughout  the  rest  of  the  U.S.,  except  the  North  Central 
region.

The  Company  Computer  Consoles,  Inc.,  founded  in  1968,  designs,  develops, 

manufactures,  markets,  and  services  UNIX-based  computer 
systems  and  software  for  the  office  and  communications  markets. 
The  company's  products  include  superminicomputers  (the 
POWER5R  and  POWER6™  family  of  computers),  integrated 
multi-functional  office  automation  systems,  and  large  data  base 
turnkey  systems  for  the  telecommunications  industry. 

CCI's  strategy  during  1987  was  to  improve  profitability,  complete  a 
financial  restructuring  of  the  company,  introduce  new  products, 
and  build  and  fine  tune  its  distribution  channels. 

On  November  30,  1987,  CCI  completed  a major  financial 
restructuring.  Its  subsidiary,  Computer  Console  Leasing 
Corporation,  sold  approximately  40%  of  its  lease  portfolio  of 
computerized  directory  assistance  systems  and  related  receivables 
to  General  Electric  Capital  Corporation  for  approximately  $48 
million.  The  proceeds  were  used  to  repay  all  existing  bank  loans, 
reducing  interest  expense  by  $4.5  million.  As  a result,  lease 
revenues  in  1988  were  reduced  by  $7  million. 

Revenue  for  1987  was  $148.4  million,  a 14.5%  increase  over  fiscal 
1986  revenue  of  $129.6  million.  Net  income  was  $11.3  million, 
compared  with  a loss  (restated)  of  $4.4  million  in  1986.

General  Electric  Capital  Corporation. 

(b)  Includes  extraordinary  gain  from  the  repurchase  of  a portion  of  its  convertible  subordinated 
debentures  of  $1.7  million  ($0. 13  a share)  during  the  fourth  quarter. 


The  increase  in  1987  revenue  included  an  increase  in  product  sales 
of  24%,  which  resulted  from  significant  revenue  in 
superminicomputer  sales  to  the  company's  original  equipment 
manufacturers  (OEMs),  and  higher  sales  to  the  company's 
resellers.  Sales  of  communications  systems  also  increased  in  1987 
reflecting  sales  of  Listing  Service  Data  Base  products,  particularly 
an  installation  of  the  LIFE-911  product,  and  sales  of  DAIS  II 
intercept  systems. 

The  increase  in  1986  revenue  reflected  a significant  increase  in 
sales  of  communications  systems,  including  shipments  under  a $25 
million  add-on  order  for  the  expansion  of  the  UK  Directory 
Assistance  System.  Sales  of  computers  and  integrated  office 
automation  systems  decreased  slightly  on  an  overall  basis  in  1986 
due  to  significantly  lower  OEM  sales.  This  was  offset  by  higher 
sales  to  law  firms  and  initial  sales  to  new  independent  distributors. 

The  1985  loss  of  $41.9  million,  which  was  $58.8  million  before  tax 
benefits,  reflected  a 15%  decline  in  revenue,  significant  changes  in

product  mix,  $16.6  million  of  provisions  for  excess  and  obsolete 
inventory  and  spares,  and  $19.3  million  of  costs  related  to  a 
program  of  internal  restructuring  and  functional  consolidation.  In 
addition,  CCI  believes  the  net  loss  reflected  an  expense  structure 
which  was  excessive  due  to  overly  optimistic  sales  projections. 

During  1987,  CCI  increased  its  network  of  independent  sales 
organizations  by  40%,  bringing  the  total  number  of  CCI  resellers 
to  84. 

CCI  is  organized  into  two  major  divisions  as  follows: 

• The  Communications  Systems  Division  in  Rochester  (NY) 
supplies  large  data  base  turnkey  systems  to  the 
telecommunications  industry  both  in  the  U.S.  and  in  certain 
international  markets.  This  division's  strategy  is  based  on  three 
product  directions: 

- Listing  Service  Data  Base  applications  which  provide  access 
to  customer  name,  address,  and  telephone  number  data  in 
residential,  business  and  government  listings. 

- Service  Control  Point  technology,  which  provides  application 
intelligence  for  digital  switching  networks. 

- Advanced  audio  systems,  based  on  CCI's  Audio  Response 
System  (ARS). 

• The  Computer  Products  Division  in  Irvine  (CA)  operates  as  a 
full-service  computer  company.  This  division  manufactures  the 
POWER  family  of  superminicomputers  and  also  provides  office 
automation  systems.  CCI's  stated  strategy  is  to  strengthen  a 
business  base  of  OEMs,  while  enlarging  its  network  of  value- 
added  resellers  (VARs)  and  office  equipment  resellers  (OERs). 

- The  division  intends  to  continue  direct  sales  to  vertical 
markets,  emphasizing  its  UNIX  operating  systems  and 
software  products. 

CCI  also  operates  the  following  units: 

• CCI  operates  a development  center  for  office  automation 
systems  in  Reston,  VA. 

• CCI  has  a service  organization  which  provides  support  and 
computer  maintenance  services  for  customers  in  all  markets.

international  markets. 

• In  the  market  for  transaction  processing  systems,  competitors 
include  companies  such  as  Tandem  and  Stratus,  which  have 
minicomputer-based  fault  tolerant  architectures. 


and  Approximately  71%  of  CCI's  1987  revenue  was  derived  from  sales 
of  integrated  systems,  as  compared  with  65%  of  1986  revenue. 
CCI's  maintenance  services  and  leasing  operations  comprised  17% 
of  1987  revenue,  as  compared  with  19%  of  revenue  in  1986.  A

The  Communications  Systems  Division  supplies  large-database 
turnkey  systems  to  the  telecommunications  industry.  Its  integrated 
systems  are  used  to  automate  operator  services. 

• In  1987,  CCI's  Communications  Systems  Division  received 
orders  from  Southern  Bell,  Puerto  Rico  Telephone  Company, 
British  Telecom,  and  Bell  Canada.  In  total,  new  orders  for  this 
division  increased  by  20%. 

• In  1987,  the  POWER6/32FT™  fault-tolerant  computer  system 
was  introduced  as  the  platform  for  CCI's  new 
telecommunications  products. 

CCI's  Communications  Systems  Division's  established  line  of 
products  include  the  following: 

• The  Directory  Assistance  System  (DAS/CCI)  is  a computerized 
directory  assistance  system  that  automates  the  search 
procedures  used  by  operators  to  locate  numbers.  It  also  allows 
continuous  updates  to  be  applied  to  the  telephone  listings.  The 
current  system  has  approximately  40  installations  in  over  100 
locations. 

- CCI  is  currently  developing  its  fourth-generation  DAS/CCI 
system,  called  Digital  Directory  Assistance  (DDA),  which

will  operate  on  CCI POWER6/32FT™  processors.  The  new 
product  will  complement  and  upgrade  existing  customer 
systems  by  offering  additional  search  features  and  the  ability 
to  interface  with  foreign  inquiry  terminals  and  the  digital 
network.  CCI  plans  to  make  this  product  available  in  early 
1989. 

• The  Audio  Response  System  (ARS),  an  enhancement  to 
DAS/CCI,  has  a pre-recorded,  digitized  vocabulary  stored  in 
computer  memory  and  is  used  to  assemble  and  announce 
telephone  listings  to  customers.  Since  its  introduction  in  1982, 
it  has  been  installed  in  over  40  customer  sites. 

- CCI  is  currently  developing  an  advanced  version  of  ARS 
called  the  Announcement  Subsystem  which  will 
accommodate  interfaces  in  a digital  network.  CCI  plans  to 
introduce  audio  components,  known  as  the  Interactive  Voice 
Subsystem  and  the  Vocabulary  Development  System,  as  part 
of  the  Announcement  Subsystem. 

• The  Interactive  Voice  Subsystem  (IVS)  is  able  to  store 
hundreds  of  hours  of  variable  length  messages.  IVS  can 
interact  with  a caller  through  touch-tone  signals, 
recorded  messages,  or  by  recording  and  transmitting  the 
caller's  voice.  IVS  is  designed  to  support  services  such  as 
Enhanced  Intercept,  Electronic  Yellow  Pages,  and 
Automated  Alternate  Billing  System  (AABS).  IVS  is 
scheduled  for  1988  availability. 

• The  Vocabulary  Development  System  (VDS)  allows 
telephone  companies  to  create  customized  audio 
messages  for  recording  and  playback  to  customers.  This 
capability  will  offer  telephone  companies  control  of  their 
vocabulary  generation  and  enable  entry  of  customized 
messages  onto  the  Announcement  Subsystem.  VDS  is 
scheduled  for  late  1988  availability. 

• The  Distributed  Automatic  Intercept  System  (DAIS  II)  merges 
directory  assistance  and  intercept  operator  positions.  DAIS  II, 
which  utilizes  CCI's  audio  response  technology,  provides  a 
means  for  handling  intercept  calls.  When  a subscriber  dials  a 
non-working  number,  DAIS  II  delivers  an  automated 
announcement  of  the  new  number  or  other  pertinent 
information  to  the  caller,  and  when  necessary,  automatically 
connects  the  caller  to  the  operator. 

CCI's  Communications  Systems  Division  also  offers  a family  of 

listing  services  data  base  (LSDB)  products  that  build  on  CCI's

established  product  line.  LSDB  is  designed  to  be  a single  data 
base  allowing  access  to  multiple  CCI  search  applications,  including 
DDA,  DAISII,  and  Automated  Listing  Services  (ALS).  The  LSDB 
products  provide  access  to  customer  name,  address,  and  telephone 
number  data  in  residential,  business,  and  government  listings. 

CCI's  first  LSDB  systems  are  planned  for  late  1988  delivery.  The 
major  applications  in  this  family  include  the  following: 

• The  Automated  Listing  Services  (ALS)  system  allows  searches 
on  the  white  pages  database  using  such  criteria  as  address  or 
telephone  number,  as  well  as  traditional  directory  assistance 
search  techniques.  The  system  supports  direct  customer  access 
(DCA)  via  public  packet  networks  for  business  and  industry, 
and  videotext  access  for  residential  users. 

• The  Yellow  Pages  System  (YPS)  automates  the  yellow  pages 
directory.  At  present,  a consent  decree  restricts  Bell  Operating 
Companies  in  the  U.S.  from  offering  these  services. 

• The  LIFE-911  is  a third-generation  emergency  data  base  system 
that  provides  Automatic  Location  Information  (ALI)  to 
telecommunications  personnel.  The  LIFE-911  system  enables 
the  call-taker  to  immediately  identify  the  telephone  number 
and  address  associated  with  a 911  call. 

• In  1987,  CCI  introduced  the  Listing  Services  Gateway,  or  CCI 
Gateway  Service  Control  Point,  an  open  network  system  that 
links  multiple  CCI  systems  as  well  as  digital  switching  systems, 
and  potentially,  foreign  data  base  systems.  The  Service  Control 
Point  system  gives  operators  access  to  multiple  data  bases  from 
a single  position,  permit  controlled  public  access  to  telephone 
information,  and  open  networked  communications  links  to  non- 
telephone data  bases.  The  Listing  Services  Gateway  is  planned 
for  delivery  in  1989. 

- During  1987,  CCI  signed  joint  development  agreements  with 
digital  switch  vendors  AT&T,  Northern  Telecom,  and 
Rockwell  Telecommunications  to  design  and  produce 
compatible  interfaces  between  their  equipment  and  CCI's 
Gateway  Service  Control  Point  product. 

The  Computer  Products  Division  manufactures  the  POWER 
family  of  computers  and  OFFICEPOWERr  office  automation 
software. 

The  POWER5r  and  POWER6™  superminicomputers  employ  the 
UNIX  operating  system  and  feature  programmable  subsystems,

POWER6/32SE™  (3  MIPS),  POWER6/32S™  (5  MIPS),  and 
the  POWER6/32SX™  (8  MIPS)  were  designed  using  smaller 
peripherals  and  do  not  require  a computer  room  environment. 
Targeted  towards  the  office  and  departmental  computing 
market,  these  computers  support  from  32  to  96  users.  The 
compact  POWER6  series  was  first  installed  in  1987  and  has  a 
base  list  price  of  $70,000. 

- As  of  May  1988,  approximately  1,110  units  from  the

communication  and  information  sharing  between  local  or 
remote  systems. 

- The  OFFICEPOWER  system  has  added  features  that  allow 
users  to  modify  the  system  to  their  particular  needs.  The 
User-Defined  Applications  Program  (UDAP),  for  example, 
enables  non-technical  users  to  create  and  manage  their  own 
specialized  data  bases  and,  in  conjunction  with  word 
processing,  allows  users  to  create  their  own  computerized 
forms  and  record  files.  Its  communications  capabilities  also 
permit  access  to  outside  databases  such  as  WESTLAW, 
LEXIS,  and  ABA/NET. 

- CCI's  office  automation  systems  support  networking  and 
communication  protocols  which  include  TCP/IP, 
ETHERNET,  ARPA/MILNET,  X.25,  SNA  3270,  SNA  3770 
(RJE),  and  bisynchronous  3270  and  2780  IBM  device 
emulators.  The  OFFICEPOWER  system  also  supports 
microcomputer  integration,  providing  microcomputer  file 
server  capabilities  and  enabling  microcomputers  to  operate 
as  full-function  terminals  within  the  system 

• Other  products  marketed  through  this  division  include  the 

following: 

- The  BASIC-K™  software  compiler  is  the  first  of  CCI's 
"liberator"  products,  allowing  users  to  port  applications  onto 
CCI's  processors.  The  BASIC-K  software  compiler  gives 
users  a migration  path  from  Wang  2200  systems  to  CCI's 
systems.  Announced  in  June  1987,  CCI  had  received  $3.5 
million  in  orders  by  year  end. 

- CCI  distributes  and  supports  industry-standard  peripheral 
devices  that  are  manufactured  by  outside  vendors.  These 
include  disk  storage  printers,  and  paper  and  envelope 
feeders.  CCI  also  markets  the  POWERTERMINAL  III™ 
graphics  terminal,  which  was  designed  by  CCI  and  is 
manufactured  by  an  outside  vendor. 


CCI's  distribution  strategy  is  to  pursue  direct  product  sales  in 
specific,  targeted  markets  and  to  seek  indirect  means  of  product 
distribution  in  general  markets. 

CCI’s  telecommunications  products  are  marketed  directly  to  the 
Regional  Bell  Operating  Companies  and  other 
telecommunications  companies  in  the  U.S.,  and  principally

through  distributors  in  foreign  countries.  The  company  also 
markets  directly  to  certain  international  customers. 

The  company's  computer  products  are  marketed  through  indirect 
distribution  channels  consisting  of  original  equipment 
manufacturers  (OEMs),  value-added  resellers  (VARs),  and 
independent  office  equipment  resellers  (OERs).  OEMs  represent 
55%,  VARs  25%,  and  OERs  10%  of  indirect  sales. 

• Internationally,  these  systems  are  marketed  through 
distributorship  and  OEM  arrangements,  and  in  conjunction 
with  wholly-owned  foreign  subsidiaries. 

• Sales  through  CCI's  various  OEM  arrangements  constitute  a 
significant  portion  of  its  sales. 

- Unisys  markets  CCI’s  products  principally  to  commercial, 
educational,  and  telecommunications  environments.  Unisys 
resells  CCI's  POWER6/32EX,  X,  and  MP  systems  as  their 
Series  700/50,  51,  and  52. 

- International  Computers,  Ltd.  (ICL)  of  the  U.K.  markets 
CCI  products  as  "departmental"  systems,  which  targets 
general  business  more  than  technical  users.  ICL  resells 
CCI's  POWER6/32S  family  as  the  CLAN  5,6  and  7 models. 

- Standard  Telephones  and  Cables  (STC)  of  Australia  targets 
vertical  markets  such  as  law  firms. 

- Kerridge  Computer  Company,  Ltd.  of  the  U.K.  adds  the 
BASIC-K  compiler  to  the  POWER 
systems/OFFICEPOWER  platform  and  targets  Wang  2200 
users.  Kerridge,  which  originally  developed  the  BASIC-K 
product,  has  contracted  to  CCI  exclusive  worldwide 
distribution  rights  outside  the  U.K. 

CCI  also  markets  its  computer  products  directly  to  end-users  in 
the  U.S.,  primarily  large  law  firms,  government  agencies,  and 
major  corporations.  These  direct  sales  represent  about  10%  of 
revenue. 

In  1987,  1986,  and  1985,  sales  to  four  customers  represented  10% 
or  more  of  CCI's  consolidated  revenues. 

• Sales  to  Unisys  amounted  to  $19.0  million  in  1987,  and  $24.4 
million  in  1985.

amounted  to  $14.8  million  in  1986  and  $14.5  million  in  1985, 
and  revenues  from  Bell  South  Services  were  $13.3  million  in 
1986. 

- Revenue  from  these  two  companies  consisted  primarily  of 
service  and  finance  income  and  represented  more  than  10% 
of  the  company's  revenue. 


Geographic  Approximately  79%  of  1987  revenue  was  derived  from  the  U.S. 

Markets  ancj  the  remaining  21%  from  international  sources,  primarily  the 

U.K.  Export  sales  grew  by  32%  from  $24.1  million  in  1986  to 
$31.8  million  in  1987. 

CCI  has  agreements  with  International  Computers,  Ltd.  (ICL)  to 
distribute  its  computers  and  office  systems  in  Europe,  with 
Standard  Telephone  and  Cables  (STC)  of  the  U.K.  to  distribute  its

In  November  1985,  CCI  restructured  operations  in  order  to  reduce 
operating  costs.  The  new  structure  eliminates  separate  business  units 
and  reorganizes  marketing  and  distribution  channels. 

CCI  now  markets  its  systems  to  OEMs  (original  equipment  manufac- 
turers), VARs  (value  added  resellers),  and  office  equipment  resellers. 
CCI  will  continue  its  direct  sales  efforts  to  the  Regional  Bell  Operating 
Companies  and  to  the  legal,  financial  services,  and  federal  government 
markets. 

• CCI  laid  off  approximately  20%  of  its  workforce  between  August  1985  and 
January  1986.  Currently,  CCI  has  approximately  1,200  employees. 

• In  September  1985,  CCI  was  awarded  a $4.4  million  contract  for  the  Secretary 
of  the  Air  Force  Computer  Assisted  Information  Support  System,  with 
implementation  to  begin  in  October  at  the  Secretary  of  Public  Affair's 
office.  The  Air  Force  order  includes  an  extensive  network  of  POWER  5/32 
systems,  POWER  6/32  minicomputers,  application  software  (including  CCI's 
OFFICEPOWER  system),  and  more  than  200  personal  computers. 

• Recent  orders  for  OFFICEPOWER  systems  have  been  received  from  the 

following  law  firms:  Reed  Smith  Shaw  & McClay;  Locke,  Purnell,  Boren, 

Laney  & McNeely;  Akin,  Gump,  Strauss,  Hauer  & Feld;  Arnold  & Porter; 
Caplin  & Drysdale;  and  the  Washington  D.C.  office  of  Baker  and  Hostetler. 

• Revenue  for  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  1986  was  $21.2  million,  an  18% 
decrease  from  revenue  of  $26  million  for  the  same  period  in  1985.  Net  losses 
were  $5.6  million  compared  to  losses  of  $5.5  million  for  the  same  period  in 
1985. 

SOURCE  OF  REVENUE 


• Approximately  39%  of  CCI's  1985  revenue  was  derived  from  integrated 
systems  sales  and  21%  from  system  rentals  and  maintenance  services.  Stand- 
alone hardware  sales  accounted  for  approximately  20%  of  revenue.  The 
remaining  20%  was  derived  from  finance  revenue  associated  with  the  leasing 
operations  of  Computer  Consoles  Leasing  Corporation.  A three-year  summary

III  is  currently  in  release. 

TELEPOWER  is  a family  of  products  for  the  telephone  industry. 

OFFICEPOWER  is  a multifunctional  office  automation  system  directed 
to  vertical  markets. 

CCI  also  offers  various  other  software  for  its  turnkey  systems. 

• CCI  introduced  POWER  5/32®  in  September  1985  as  the  newest  member  of 
CCI's  POWER  5 series  of  minicomputers.  Power  5/32  is  designed  primarily  for 
office  automation  applications. 

CCI's  first  major  customer  for  the  POWER  5/32  is  the  U.S.  Air  Force. 

• CCI  introduced  two  new  members  of  its  POWER  6/32  family  of  high-perform- 
ance superminicomputers  in  April  1986. 

The  POWER  6/32E  fills  in  the  performance  gap  between  the  entry-level 
POWER  5/32  computer  and  its  flagship  POWER  6/32  superminicom- 
puter. POWER  6/32E  is  designed  to  support  30  to  100  users  and  can  be 
upgraded  to  a POWER  6/32. 

. A basic  system  with  4 Mbytes  of  memory  and  a 32-user  UNIX 
System  V license  is  priced  at  $124,950. 

The  POWER  6/32MP  is  a multi-processor  system  that  delivers  almost 
twice  the  performance  of  the  POWER  6/32.  The  POWER  6/32MP 
performs  scientific  and  number  crunching  functions  and  can  support  a 
number  of  users. 

. Delivery  will  be  available  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  1986.  A 
POWER  6/32MP  with  16  Mbytes  of  memory  and  a 32-user  UNIX 
license  is  priced  at  $29,500. 

• During  1985  CCI  also  introduced  POWER  6/55  T M‘ , a version  of  the  POWER 
6/32  designed  to  provide  high-performance  fault-tolerant  processing  for 
advanced  computing  and  communications  applications.

(a)  Data  for  1980,  1981,  and  1982  was  adjusted  in  1983  for  100%  stock  distributions 
paid  on  June  30,  1983. 


CCI  management  attributes  increased  revenue  in  1984  to  increased  sales  of 
office  system  products,  acceptance  of  the  new  Customer  Name  and  Address 
System  (CNA),  initial  shipments  of  the  POWER6/32,  shipments  of  the 
Directory  Assistance  System  (DAS/CCI)  to  British  Telecom,  and  customer 
lease  extensions. 

The  DAS/CCI  system  being  installed  for  British  Telecom,  valued  at  $34 
million,  is  scheduled  for  acceptance  in  late  1985  and  contributed 
approximately  $22  million  in  1984  revenue.

Customer  lease  extensions  resulted  from  four  telephone  companies 
signing  long-term  lease  renewals  that  call  for  upgrading  to  Version  3 of 
DAS/CCI  and  adding  the  Audio  Response  System.  The  renewals  will 
generate  revenue  into  1994,  with  a total  value  of  over  $90  million. 

• CCI's  decreases  in  net  income  and  earnings  per  share  are  attributed  to  lower 
equipment  margins  and  higher  support  costs  associated  with  British  Telecom 
revenues,  more  competitive  margins  on  office  systems,  and  higher  inventory 
reserves.  Increased  expenses  were  incurred  relating  to  the  development, 
marketing,  and  support  of  office  automation  and  the  POWER6/32,  and  interest 
expenses  increased  due  to  short-term  borrowing  to  support  higher  inventory 
levels  that  resulted  from  lower  than  anticipated  growth. 

• In  January  1985  CCI's  Telephony  Systems  Group  was  renamed  Advanced 
Computer  Systems.  The  name  change  reflects  the  decision  to  pursue  markets 
in  commercial  audio  response,  telemarketing,  and  large  fault-tolerant  systems 
using  networked  data  bases,  although  the  telephone  industry  will  continue  to 
be  the  primary  focus  of  this  group. 

The  installed  base  of  telephony  systems  is  currently  valued  at  more 
than  $300  million,  and  CCI  is  maintaining  its  nationwide  share  of  over 
60%  of  the  Directory  Assistance  market. 

TELEPOWER®  products  scheduled  for  delivery  in  1985  include  the  new 
Distributed  Automated  Intercept  System  (DAIS  II)  for  automating 
personnel-intensive  intercept  operations;  and  the  Automated  Business 
Listing  System  (ABL),  a computerized  yellow  pages  service. 

• Recent  orders  for  OFFICEPOWER  systems  have  been  received  from  Dow 
Jones  & Company,  Inc.,  the  Chicago  Board  of  Trade,  and  the  California 
governor's  office. 

• Revenue  for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  1985  was  $61  million,  a 4% 
decrease  from  revenue  of  $63.3  million  for  the  first  half  of  1984.  CCI  experi- 
enced a net  loss  of  $10.1  million  ($0.89  per  share)  for  the  period  compared  to 
a net  income  of  $4.1  million  for  the  same  period  a year  ago.  Before  tax  losses 
include  approximately  $1  I million  in  inventory  write-downs  due  to  lower  than 
anticipated  growth  in  revenue,  changes  in  product  mix,  and  depressed  market 
values  for  various  semiconductor  components. 

SOURCE  OF  REVENUE 

• Approximately  71%  of  CCI's  1984  revenue  was  derived  from  integrated 
systems  sales  and  16%  from  maintenance  services.  The  remaining  13%  was 
derived  from  finance  revenue  associated  with  the  leasing  operations  of 
Computer  Consoles  Leasing  Corporation.  A three-year  summary  of  source  of 
revenue  follows  ($  millions):

FIVE-YEAR  FINANCIAL  SUMMARY 
($  thousands,  except  per  share  data) 


(a)  Adjusted  for  100%  stock  distributions  paid  on  June  30,  1983  and  March  31,  1980. 


CCI  management  attributes  increased  revenue  in  1983  to  increased  customer 
acceptance  of  the  company's  Audio  Response  System  (an  enhancement  to  its 
computerized  directory  assistance  system,  DAS/CCI),  sales  of  office  systems

• Hardware  for  CCI  systems  consists  of  the  following: 

CCI  assembles  terminals  and  controllers  for  terminals,  communica- 
tions, input/output,  disks,  and  peripherals. 

Magnetic  tape  units,  printers,  readers,  disk  drives,  and  other  optional 
peripheral  equipment  purchased  from  other  manufacturers  are  offered 
as  part  of  CCI  systems. 

Most  of  CCI's  systems  incorporate  a fault-tolerant  design  (referred  to 
as  Perpetual  Processing™)  that  permits  continuous  system  avail- 
ability. This  architecture  enables  the  system  to  compensate  auto- 
matically for  the  failure  of  individual  modules  by  rerouting  to  a 
parallel  control  unit  in  another  subsystem. 

Historically  CCI  systems  have  incorporated  central  processing  units 
purchased  from  other  manufacturers  (DEC  or  Sperry-Univac).  In  late 
1982  CCI  announced  its  own  POWER  5 Computer  Family  of  minicom- 
puters. 


. The  POWER  5 family  is  characterized  by  the  expandability  of 
the  system,  its  ability  to  handle  large  volumes. of  data,  and  its 
UNIX-compatible  operating  system,  PERPOSC^ — (& 

. The  mid-range  minicomputers,  with  expandability  to  include 
fault  tolerance  where  required,  serve  as  hardware  support  for 
telephone  and  office  system  products. 

The  POWER  6 Series  is  CCI's  newest  hardware  series.  In  May  1984  CCI 
announced  its  POWER  6/32™  , a high-performance,  32-bit,  UNIX- 
based  superminicomputer  designed  to  enhance  the  speed  and  applica- 
tions of  its  newest  systems  for  telephone  and  office  markets. 

. The  POWER  6/32  is  designed  to  compete  with  systems  based  on 
DEC  VAX- 1 1/785  and  Data  General  MV/ 1 000  superminicom- 
puters. 

. In  October  1984  CCI  signed  a multiyear  OEM  agreement  with 
Sperry  Corporation  under  which  CCI  will  supply  to  Sperry  a 
minimum  of  200  POWER  6/32  systems  annually. 

. In  August  1984  CCI  announced  that  it  would  be  supplying  its 
POWER  6/55  fault-tolerant  transaction  processing  supermini- 
computer system  to  MCI. 

• CCI's  integrated  systems  for  the  telephone  industry  are  used  to  automate 
operator  services  procedures  that  formerly  were  costly  and  slow  to  perform. 

The  Directory  Assistance  System  (DAS/CCI)  automates  the  process 
used  by  directory  assistance  operators  in  locating  telephone  numbers

requested  by  a caller.  A phonetic  name  search  capability  allows  the 
operator  to  find  telephone  numbers  when  the  spelling  of  the  name  is 
unknown. 

. DAS/CCI  fault-tolerant  systems  vary  substantially  in  size  and 
have  handled  as  many  as  87,800  file  inquiries  per  hour.  The 
average  system  uses  approximately  250  terminals  and  up  to 
eight  system  control  units  based  on  DEC  minicomputers. 

. DAS/CCI  system  prices  range  from  $800,000  to  $9  million, 
depending  on  system  complexity. 

. As  of  December  31,  1983,  DAS/CCI  was  installed  in  51  systems 
with  166  remote  locations  representing  $132  million  ("if-sold" 
value)  and  involving  10,450  operator  positions  handling  in  excess 
of  five  million  customer  calls  per  day.  CCI  management  be- 
lieves its  company  dominates  the  directory  assistance  market, 
having  approximately  70%  of  the  installed  systems  in  the  U.S. 

. There  are  currently  over  51  systems  with  168  remote  locations. 

The  Audio  Response  System  (ARS),  introduced  in  1982  as  an  enhance- 
ment to  DAS/CCI,  improves  operator  productivity  by  as  much  as  30%. 

. After  locating  the  desired  listing,  the  operator  need  only  press  a 
single  key  and  a digitized  voice  announces  the  number  to  the 
caller. 

. ARS  prices  range  from  $1  million  to  $5  million,  depending  on 
system  complexity. 

. As  of  December  31,  1983,  ARS  was  installed  at  35  sites  repre- 
senting over  $50  million  ("if-sold"  value).  There  are  currently  45 
ARS  installations. 

In  1983  CCI  introduced  TELEPOWER,  a family  of  products  for  the 
telephone  industry  that  provides  local  telephone  companies  with  the 
capability  of  turning  their  listing  service  information  into  higher  value, 
revenue-producing  services. 

. Customer  Name  & Address?  the  first  TELEPOWER  system, 
permits  a search  of  the  Listing  Service  data  base,  using  only  the

In  December  1983  CCI  received  an  order  in  excess  of  $1.5 
million  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  in  Wash- 
ington (DC). 

In  December  1983  the  company  received  a $2  million  order  from 
Hale  & Dorr,  Boston's  largest  law  firm.  The  OFFICEPOWER

In  March  1984  CCI  signed  a distribution  agreement  with 
Standard  Telephones  & Cables  of  the  U.K.  for  $6  million  in 
office  automation  systems  over  the  next  18  months.  Potential 
total  value  of  the  agreement,  pending  exercise  of  all  options 
over  a four-year  period,  is  in  excess  of  $53  million. 

In  July  1984  CCI  announced  that  its  OFFICEPOWER  systems 
will  be  distributed  in  Canada  by  Telecommunications  Terminal 
Systems  of  Toronto  under  a three-year,  $7  million  agreement. 

Other  OFFICEPOWER  customers  include  Best  Products,  Fleming 
Foods,  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  the  U.S.  Army,  and  Citibank  (Person-to- 
Person  division). 

In  November  1984  CCI  introduced  CCI  PC,  the  company's  first  desktop 
personal  computer. 

. CCI  states  it  brought  the  product  to  market  not  to  compete  in 
the  standalone  market  but  to  address  the  needs  of  the  desktop 
computer  user  while  at  the  same  time  offering  the  use  of  its 
OFFICEPOWER  system. 

. CCI  PC  is  hardware  and  software  compatible  with  the  IBM  PC. 

?? 

CCI  provides  maintenance  services  to  its  clients  from  85  service  locations 
throughout  the  U.S.  and  Canada.  The  company  currently  employs  over  2G0 
customer  service  representatives.

• CCI  revenue  and  net  income  for  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  1981 
were  $33.4  million  and  $3.6  million,  respectively. 

ACQUISITIONS 

• In  February  1981,  CCI  acquired  all  of  the  outstanding  shares  of  RLG 
Corporation  in  exchange  for  45,000  shares  of  CCI  common  stock.  A privately 
held  software  product  firm  located  in  Reston,  VA,  RLG  had  approximately  $2 
million  in  1980  revenue  and  will  operate  as  a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  CCI. 

• In  October  1981,  CCI  acquired  a 66%  interest  in  the  Time  Machine  Ltd.,  a firm 
engaged  in  minicomputer  development.  The  Time  Machine,  with  25  employ- 
ees, is  located  in  Haifa,  Israel  and  has  no  operating  revenue  to  date.  The 
remaining  34%  equity  interest  in  the  company  is  shared  by  Israeli  management 
and  a Swiss  investor. 

CCI  intends  to  manufacture  the  minicomputer,  to  be  used  in  CCI 
turnkey  products,  in  both  New  York  and  Israel  for  marketing  in  North 
America  and  Europe. 

SUBSIDIARIES 

• Computer  Consoles  Leasing  Corporation  (CCLC),  a wholly  owned  unconsoli- 
dated subsidiary,  finances  leasing  operations.  CCI  systems  are  generally 
leased  long-term,  rather  than  sold. 

• Computer  Consoles  Service  Corporation  (CCSC),  a wholly  owned  consolidated 
subsidiary,  services  and  maintains  virtually  all  of  the  company's  systems. 

EMPLOYEES 

• CCI's  823  employees  are  distributed  as  follows:

PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

• CCI  turnkey  file  management  systems  are  marketed  to  the  telephone  industry. 
CCI's  expertise  lies  in  designing  data  base  software  for  large  data  bases  and  in 
the  high  reliability  of  its  sytems. 

Perpetual  Processing™  is  a design  feature  used  in  several  CCI  systems 
that  permits  continuous  system  availability.  High  reliability  is  achieved 
by  the  interconnection  of  two  to  eight  parallel  system  control  units, 
each  containing  multiple  data  base  copies.  If  one  or  more  system 
components  fail,  these  functions  can  be  routed  to  a parallel  control  unit 
in  another  subsystem. 

CCI  systems  are  easily  upgraded.  Additional  hardware  may  be  attached 
to  a system  while  it  is  in  operation,  without  changing  or  adding 
software. 

• Standard  CCI  turnkey  systems  include: 

Directory  Assistance  System  (DAS/CCI),  first  installed  in  1977,  auto- 
mates the  locating  of  names  and  telephone  numbers  by  information 
operators.  A phonetic  search  capability  enables  the  operator  to  search 
for  similar-sounding  names.  DAS/CCI  stores  several  million  telephone 
listings  which  can  be  accessed  by  hundreds  of  operators  in  both  central 
and  remote  sites.  Response  time  ranges  from  0.5  to  1.5  seconds. 

. The  average  system  uses  approximately  200  terminals  and  up  to 
eight  system  control  units  based  on  DEC  minicomputers. 
DAS/CCI  is  a Perpetual  Processing  system.  Prices  range  from 
$800,000  to  $7  million,  depending  on  system  complexity. 
DAS/CCI  is  currently  installed  at  36  central  sites  and  107 
remote  sites. 

. Sales  and  leases  of  DAS/CCI  systems  contributed  74%,  83%,  and 
59%  of  CCI  revenue  in  1978,  1979,  and  1980,  respectively. 

Plug-in  Inventory  Control  System/Business  Administration  and  Record 
System  (PICS/BARS)  was  developed  jointly  by  CCI  and  Bell  Labora- 
tories. First  installed  in  the  winter  of  1980,  PICS/BARS  is  a manage- 
ment information  system  that  maintains  the  order  entry  and  inventory 
records  of  components,  unit  size,  and  software  options  for  AT&T's 
installed  base  of  private  branch  exchanges  (PBXs). 

. PICS/BARS  uses  Varian  minicomputers  and  is  installed  in  19 
central  and  86  remote  sites.  Prices  range  from  $500,000  to  $1 
million. 

. PICS/BARS  sales  contributed  $2.1  million  to  1980  revenue.

Toll  Operator  Position  Information  Computerized  (TOPIC)  provides 
operators  with  information  on  local  toll-free  numbers,  call  rates, 
domestic  or  international  direct  dial  instructions,  and  emergency 
numbers.  TOPIC,  introduced  late  in  1980,  uses  DEC  minicomputers  and 
may  be  installed  in  conjunction  with  existing  DAS/CCI  systems. 

The  800  Directory  Assistance  and  Rate  and  Route  Information 
Computerized  System  (800  DAS/C-RRIC)  provides  directory  operators 
with  toll-free  "800"  number  information  and  automates  records  for 
central  rate  and  route  information  operators.  The  product,  which  runs 
on  DEC  minicomputers,  was  developed  under  a contract  with  AT&T  and 
will  be  marketed  to  AT&T  affiliates.  CCI  expects  this  system  to 
complement  its  TOPIC  product  in  the  future. 

• Standard  turnkey  systems  for  which  the  markets  are  saturated,  but  continue  to 
generate  enhancement,  lease,  and  maintenance  revenue  include: 

Facilities  and  Equipment  System  (F&E),  first  installed  in  1972,  auto- 
mates the  storing  and  updating  of  records  for  trunk  lines  and  associated 
central  office  equipment.  There  are  approximately  24  central  site 
installations  with  19  remote  locations. 

Direct  Access  Intercept  System  (DAIS),  first  installed  in  1973,  provides 
operators  with  information  on  the  status  of  telephone  numbers  which 
have  changed  or  are  no  longer  in  service.  DAIS  is  installed  in 
approximately  nine  central  sites  and  20  remote  locations. 

• CCI  designed  the  International  Service  Position  System  (ISPS)  in  1980  to  meet 
AT&T  specifications  under  a $10.6  million  development,  manufacturing,  and 
maintenance  contract.  ISPS  is  a Perpetual  Processing  system  using  Varian 
minicomputers  that  facilitates  the  placing  and  recording  of  overseas  calls 
requiring  operator  assistance.  CCI  derived  $10.1  million  in  professional 
services  revenue  in  1980  from  this  contract.  Approximately  seven  systems 
have  been  installed. 

• In  August  1981,  CCI  introduced  Office  Power™,  an  office  automation  system 
available  as  either  a software  package  or  on  a turnkey  basis.  Office  Power  is 
an  enhanced  version  of  a product  developed  by  RLG  and  will  use  CCI's 
Perpetual  Processing  capability. 

Automated  features  include  an  appointment  calendar,  tickler  file, 
address  and  telephone  directories,  telephone  call  log,  desk  calculator, 
electronic  mail,  word  processing,  and  electronic  filing. 

• EMAP  (Environment  for  Managing  ATLAS  Programs),  a software  package 
developed  by  RLG,  is  currently  being  marketed  by  CCI.  EMAP  reduces  the 
time  required  to  write  and  test  programs  used  in  Automatic  Test  Equipment 
for  testing  military-type  systems.  The  package  integrates  ATLAS  develop- 
ment tools,  communication  functions,  and  managerial  resources.  EMAP  is  also 
available  on  a turnkey  basis.

• Voice  Response,  an  enhancement  to  DAS/CCI,  is  being  developed  by  CCI  for 
marketing  in  1982.  The  system  allows  the  computer  to  respond  vocally  to  a 
caller  with  the  correct  number,  enabling  the  information  operator  to  receive 
another  call. 

• In  November  1981,  AT&T  selected  CCI  to  develop  a new  generation  of 
directory  assistance  systems  (2A  DAS/CCI)  for  use  by  Bell  Telephone  com- 
panies. Initial  system  installations  are  planned  for  1983. 

INDUSTRY  MARKETS 

• CCI  markets  its  products  to  the  telephone  industry. 

Over  90%  of  the  company's  revenue  in  1980,  1979,  and  1978  was  from 
sales  to  affiliates  and  subsidiaries  of  AT&T. 

GEOGRAPHIC  MARKETS 

• An  estimated  90%  of  1980  revenue  was  derived  domestically.  The  remaining 
10%  of  revenue  was  from  international  sales  in  Canada  and  Australia.

In  addition  to  Rochester,  branch  offices  are  located  in:

OVERALL  ASSESSMENT  AND  TRENDS:  CCI  got  off  to  a slow  start  when  it 

was  founded  in  1968  as  an  equipment  manufacturer.  Its  first  data 
management  system  was  marketed  in  1974  and  that  is  when  the  company 
experienced  excellent  growth.  Total  sales  for  1973  were  $5,472,242 
and  for  1974  they  were  $9,208,484;  an  increase  of  68%  in  one  year. 
Sales  were  down  for  1975,  which  President  Affel  attributes  to  the 
economic  recession.  Despite  the  decrease  in  sales  CCI  remained  pro- 
fitable in  1975,  based  on  the  preliminary  figures  available  to  mana- 
gement. CCI's  bank,  Marine  Midland,  was  willing  to  extend  a new  line 
of  credit  about  the  end  of  November,  1975.  The  company  has  developed 
a good  reputation  within  the  Bell  System  for  quality  and  good  service 
and  has  been  written  up  in  several  Telephone  Company  publications. 

Its  main  weakness  is  its  high  dependence  upon  Ma  Bell  as  a source  of 
income.  CCI  has  begun  taking  steps  to  correct  this,  such  as  by  of- 
fering ITT  marketing  rights  to  its  services  overseas  and  by  develop- 
ing plans  to  expand  into  banking  and  other  public  utilities,  as  well 
as  blood  banks.

• CCS  offers  only  processing  services.  Approximately  95%  of  revenues 
are  generated  by  remote  batch  processing  for  medical  and  doctors' 
clinics.  These  services  are  being  migrated  to  interactive  remote 
computing  services  which  now  generate  a small  percentage  of  total 
revenues.  Of  the  remaining  revenues,  less  than  1%%  derives  from 
batch  processing  and  approximately  2%  from  on-line,  computer- 
assisted  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  services  for  mobile  heart  stations.

The  remote  batch  services  have  on-line  key  to  diskette  data  entry 
utilizing  IBM  3741  floppy  diskette  equipment.  These  services 
are  being  converted  remote  batch  to  interactive;  the  first 
interactive  systems  will  be  installed  during  the  second  half 
of  1977.  The  services  are  approximately  55%  third  party 
billing — CHAMPUS,  Medicare,  Blue  Shield,  and  Medicaid:  and  40% 
patient  billing. 

- The  primary  interactive  product  is  COMET.  It  includes  patient 
registration,  insurance  processing,  payroll,  accounts  payable, 
accounts  receivable,  and  patient  billing. 

- The  services  include  key-to-diskette  and  interactive  data 
entry  over  telecommunications  lines.  The  company  installs 
terminals  at  customer  clinic  locations  for  data  entry. 

CCS  recently  introduced  a turnkey  system  for  computer-assisted 
ECG  analysis.  The  system  gives  the  doctor  a direct  link  between 
the  ECG  machine  and  CCS's  main  computer. 

- The  doctor  also  has  an  on-site  CRT  or  teleprinter  terminal 
for  further  analysis  and  "over-reading" — entering  or  changing 
data  on  the  ECG.  Output  is  through  the  CRT  or  teleprinter 
terminal  via  leased  lines. 

- The  system  allows  on-line  file  updates  and  new  file  creation. 
All  clients  have  separate  data  bases  which  management  claims 
are  fully  secured. 

- The  first  system  was  installed  in  1976.  CCS  management  expects 
eight  additional  ECG  systems  to  be  installed  during  1978. 

A small  amount  of  business  is  still  generated  by  general  business 
services  to  local  commercial  clients.  Services  include  standard 
accounting  packages. 


APPLICATIONS  & INDUSTRY  MARKETS  About  98%  of  CCS  revenues  derive  from 
specialty  services  with  medical  applications.  The  remaining  2%  come 
from  general  business  services  to  early  clients.  Doctors'  clinics, 
rather  than  hospitals  or  physicians,  produce  the  majority  of  revenues. 


GEOGRAPHIC  MARKETS 


Nearly  65%  of  CCS's  revenues  are  derived  from  the  Midwest  and  North 
Central  states.  The  rest  are  evenly  distributed  between  the 
Mountain,  Pacific,  and  Southeastern  regions. 

Branch  offices  are  located  in  Atlanta,  GA;  Chicago,  IL;  and  San 
Francisco,  CA.

All  of  CCA's  professional  services  are  performed  for  the  federal  government. 
Basic  research  and  system  design/implementation  centers  on  computer 
networks  and  data  base  management.  Representative  projects  include  the 
following: 

Design  and  implementation  of  Datacomputer,  a DBMS  employed  by 
several  hundred  ARPANET  users.  CCA  co-authored  the  concept  of 
ARPANET,  the  first  nationwide  computer  network,  for  the  Department 
of  Defense. 

Research  and  experimentation  for  a Chemical  Substances  Information 
Network  (CSIN).  CSIN  will  enable  users  to  retrieve  and  relate  chemical 
data  from  widely  dispersed,  and  independently  operated  computer 
systems. 

SDD-I,  the  first  distributed  data  base  system  for  general,  large-scale 
operations,  designed  for  the  Department  of  Defense. 

Multibase,  a facility  for  interfacing  local  data  bases  which  are  part  of  a 
distributed  network,  but  which  use  different  DBMSs.  Multibase  is  being 
created  for  the  Department  of  Defense. 

The  Distributed  Data  Base  Concurrency  Control  project,  which  com- 
pared the  performance  of  concurrency  control  methods  for  Rome  Air 
Development  Center. 

Designing  ADAPLEX,  a general  purpose  language  for  programming  data 
base  applications  suitable  for  both  centralized  and  distributed  DBMSs. 
ADAPLEX  embeds  the  data  base  sublanguage,  DAPLEX,  in  ADA,  the 
proposed  standard  programming  language  of  the  Department  of 
Defense. 

The  CODASYL  Query  Language  Project,  sponsored  by  the  National 
Bureau  of  Standards.  CCA  is  developing  a query  language  for  access 
to  CODASYL  network  data  bases  by  nonprogrammers. 

Ongoing  research  and  development  in  Spatial  Data  Management.  Data 
base  information  is  represented  graphically  on  a CRT,  in  contrast  to 
conventional  DBMSs  in  which  data  is  accessed  by  asking  questions  in  a 
formal  query  language.  CCA  has  completed  an  experimental  system. 

The  Program  Visualization  Project,  for  which  CCA  is  investigating  the 
use  of  computer  graphics  in  the  design,  development,  documentation, 
and  maintenance  of  software.  The  company  is  building  a system  that 
will  create  graphic  displays  of  running  programs,  and  allow  the  user  to 
control  and  modify  the  programs  through  graphic  interaction. 

CCA  offers  two  primary  products,  Model  204  Data  Base  Management  System, 
which  contributed  $4,089,000  (41%)  of  1981  revenue,  and  COMET,  an  elec- 
tronic mail  system,  which  contributed  $1,755,000  (17%).

• Model  204  was  introduced  in  1971  and  has  been  upgraded  annually.  It  is  a 
generalized  data  base  management  system  which  supports  IBM  mainframe 
users.  The  product  provides  access  to  data  in  on-line  or  batch  modes,  and 
features  an  English-like  user  language. 

Four  basic  modules  can  be  used  to  configure  a Model  204  system: 

. Inverted  File  Access  Method  (IFAM),  a proprietary  implementa- 
tion of  the  inverted  file  approach. 

. User  language  modules. 

. Host  language  interface. 

. Utility  programs  to  build  and  maintain  the  data  base. 

Model  204  has  a wide  range  of  application  capabilities  that  include: 

. Financial  analysis. 

. Personnel  administration. 

. Federal  information  systems. 

. Scheduling  and  planning. 

. Inventory  control. 

. Professional  service  billing  and  reporting. 

. Telephone  directory  assistance. 

Up  to  1,000  users  can  be  supported  simultaneously;  each  user  can 
manipulate  up  to  eight  billion  on-line  records. 

Model  204  runs  on  IBM  360/370,  303X,  and  4300  models,  as  well  as  on 
plug-compatible  mainframes.  It  operates  under  OS/MVT,  VS  I,  VS2/SVS, 
VS2/MVS,  DOS/VS,  and  DOS/VSE.  These  operating  systems  may  run 
standalone  or  under  VM.  Model  204  has  its  own  teleprocessing  monitor, 
and  can  also  be  accessed  through  CICS,  INTERCOMM,  or  TSO.  Inter- 
faces are  provided  for  COBOL,  PL/ 1,  FORTRAN,  and  Assembler 
Language. 

Two  optional  enhancements  are  available. 

. Distributed/204  DBMS  allows  data  bases  to  be  fully  distributed 
over  any  number  of  mainframes,  but  to  be  perceived  by  the  end 
user  as  centralized. 

. COMET/204  is  an  integration  of  the  COMET  electronic  mail 
system  with  Model  204.  The  same  terminal  is  used  for  data  base 
access  and  for  electronic  message  handling. 

Model  204  prices  range  from  $60,000  to  $195,000.  Over  125  packages 
have  been  installed. 

The  system  is  available  on  several  service  bureaus,  including  Data- 
crown,  Informatics,  and  COMNET.

formed for  the  federal  government.  In  1979,  this  figure  was  80%.  CCA 
expects  that  the  government  sector  will  contribute  an  increasingly  smaller 
percentage  of  total  sales,  as  the  company  focuses  on  its  commercial  products. 

• COMET  and  Model  204  are  sold  across  all  industry  sectors,  and  contributed 
58%  of  1981  revenue.  Sales  were  particularly  strong  in  the  oil,  aerospace, 
telecommunications,  banking  and  finance,  petrochemical,  and  pharmaceutical 
industries.  CCA  targets  Fortune  1000  sized  commercial  and  government 
organizations.

Remaining  revenues  were  derived  from  software  sales  to  all  sectors, 
particularly  the  oil  and  aerospace  industries. 


GEOGRAPHIC  MARKETS 

• In  1979,  less  than  $100,000  was  derived  from  business  in  Europe  and  Canada. 
CCA  anticipates  that  revenues  generated  in  the  Japanese,  European  and 
Canadian  markets  will  account  for  $500,000  in  1980. 

As  the  federal  government  is  the  company's  primary  client,  much  of  its 
business  tends  to  be  in  the  Washington,  D.C.  area.  Other  clients  are 
concentrated  in  New  York,  Boston,  and  Chicago. 

CCA  maintains  a branch  office  in  Arlington  (VA),  and  sales  offices  in 
Chicago,  Houston,  New  York,  and  San  Francisco. 


COMPUTER  HARDWARE 

• Computer  equipment  used  for  the  COMET  service,  as  well  as  for  testing  and 
development  purposes,  consists  of: 

One  DEC  PDP- 10,  I OX. 

Two  DEC  PDP- 1 I /70s  UNIX,  RSX  I I M.

Private  Corporation 
Total  employees:  48 

Total  revenues,  fiscal  year 
end  12/31/77:  $2.1  million 


THE  COMPANY: 


• Computer  Corporation  of  America,  Inc.  (CCA)  was  founded  in  1965  by 
Dr.  Marill.  It  specializes  in  the  design,  development,  and  imple- 
mentation of  data  base/data  communications  systems. 

• Since  early  in  1971,  CCA  has  been  marketing  its  model  204  as  a 
standardized  data  base  management  software  package. 

• In  1976  CCA  had  a major  reorganization  changing  the  company  from 

a one-man,  one-product  operation  to  a company  with  two  separate 
and  distinct  divisions:  commercial  products  and  sponsored  re- 

search. The  Commercial  Products  Division  is  responsible  for  soft- 
ware sales.  The  Sponsored  Research  Division  provides  system  de- 
velopment and  implementation  under  contract  to  the  Federal  Govern- 
ment . 

• CCA  has  had  a corresponding  shift  to  increase  the  emphasis  on  soft- 
ware product  sales.  Currently  less  than  40%  of  total  revenues,  soft- 
ware sales  are  targeted  to  be  generating  50%  of  revenues  by  year  end 
1980. 

• The  Federal  Government  has  traditionally  generated  the  great  majority 
of  CCA  revenues . 

• Traditionally  CCA  has  depended  on  its  research  staff  to  provide 
marketing  of  its  services  to  the  Federal  market.  Recognizing  the 
need  for  a professional  sales  force,  CCA  added  five  full  time  sales 
persons  in  June  of  1976  and  intends  to  increase  this  to  nine  in  1978. 


KEY  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES: 


• The  Commercial  Products  Division,  generating  approximately  40%  of 

total  company  revenues,  has  two  basic  products:  Model  204  and  TDA. 

Although  sold  as  standard  packaged  software,  they  will  be  customized 
for  a fee  to  meet  specific  client  requirements.  Installed  software 
is  enhanced  and  maintained  by  CCA.

COMPANY  HIGHLIGHT/COMPUTER  CORPORATION  OF  AMERICA,  INC. 


The  Model  204  is  a general  purpose  data  base  management 
system  available  for  IBM  360/370  computer  systems.  It 
is  currently  installed  at  26  sites,  including  INFORMATICS, 
both  houses  of  the  U.S.  Congress,  and  Columbia  University. 

It  is  used  for  personnel  inventory  control,  budget  pre- 
paration, and  legislative  bidding  status  reports. 

- TDA  is  an  "electronic  mail"  message  service  being  developed 
by  CCA.  It  is  currently  available  for  testing  and  evalua- 
tion over  TELENET  and  at  one  test  site. 

• The  Sponsored  Research  Division,  currently  generates  approximately 
60%  of  CCA  revenues.  Both  of  the  proprietary  software  products 
marketed  through  the  Commercial  Products  Division  were  developed 
by  the  Research  Division.  The  company  anticipates  that  all  new 
products  will  also  be  developed  by  this  division  or  under  contract 
to  clients. 

Current  clients  are  agencies  of  the  U.S.  Government. 

This  division  has  developed  the  Datacomputer , a large-scale 
data  system  for  the  ARPA  network.  Datacomputer,  based  on 
a DEC  PDP/10  and  an  Ampex  TBM,  handles  shared  on-line  data 
bases  of  up  to  on  trillion  bits. 

The  Sponsored  Research  Division  also  does  custom  research 
for  the  U.S.  Government,  primarily  the  Department  of  Defense. 


APPLICATIONS : CCA  products  are  all  general  purpose;  and  therefore,  would 

be  classified  as  having  general  business  applications. 


INDUSTRY  MARKETS : Seventy-five  percent  of  CCA  revenues  are  generated  by 

the  U.S.  Government.  The  remaining  25%  are  generated  by  software  licensed 
to  state  and  federal  agencies,  industrial  firms,  and  universities. 


GEOGRAPHIC  MARKETS : Seventy-five  percent  of  CCA  revenues  are  derived  from 

the  Washington,  D.C.  area.  Other  revenues  are  derived  from  clients  in 
Boston,  New  York,  and  Chicago. 


• The  company  currently  ooperates: 

One  DEC  PDP-10  supplemented  by  an  AMPEX  TBM  trillion  bit  memory 
system  and  standard  peripherals. 

Three  DEC  PDP-ll/40s  with/disks  and  standard  peripherals. 

• CCA  is  installing  an  additional  DEC  PDP-11/70.

CDSI  management  attributes  fiscal  1990  results  to  the  following: 

• Revenue  growth  during  fiscal  1990  resulted  primarily  from  full- 
year  performance  on  the  Department  of  Energy  and  General 
Services  Administration  contracts  in  the  Professional  Services 
Group.  Revenue  from  the  Enterprise  Systems  Group  increased 
3%,  with  moderate  growth  in  proprietary  software  package 
sales. 

• Costs  and  expenses  increased  approximately  15%  during  fiscal 
1990  compared  to  69%  in  fiscal  1989.  The  smaller  increase 
resulted  from  the  absence  of  start-up  costs  associated  with  the 
prior  year’s  contract  awards,  improved  performance  on  fixed- 
price  contracts,  and  a $500,000  reduction  in  operating  losses  in 
the  Software  Productivity  Tools  Division. 

• Net  income  increased  due  to  improved  operating  margins  and 
increased  interest  and  other  income.

CDSI  management  attributes  fiscal  1989  results  to  the  following: 

• Revenue  growth  during  fiscal  1989  resulted  primarily  from  the 
performance  of  new  Department  of  Energy  and  General 
Services  Administration  contracts  awarded  to  CDSI's 
Professional  Services  Group  during  the  first  three  months  of 
fiscal  1989.  Revenue  from  the  Data  Processing  Support 
Services  Group  increased  13%  during  fiscal  1989  due  primarily 
to  growth  in  proprietary  software  package  sales. 

• Costs  and  expenses  increased  approximately  69%  during  fiscal 
1989  compared  to  24%  in  fiscal  1988.  The  greater  rate  of 
increase  was  attributed  to  narrower  margins  bid  on  new 
contract  awards,  startup  costs  on  the  new  contracts,  a loss  on  a 
fixed-price  contract  of  approximately  $600,000,  and  startup 
costs  and  operating  losses  in  the  Software  Productivity  Tools 
Division  of  approximately  $1.2  million. 

CDSI's  current  operations  are  conducted  through  three  major 

groups  and  various  divisions  as  follows:

• Increase  in  fiscal  1982  revenue  was  primarily  due  to  a major  contract  with  the 
General  Services  Administration  (GSA)  along  with  new  contract  awards  and 
renewals  in  both  professional  and  processing  services.  In  fiscal  1981  approxi- 
mately 90%  of  the  revenue  increase  was  attributable  to  the  processing  ser- 
vices segment. 

Start-up  costs  associated  with  the  GSA  contract  caused  net  income  to 
increase  at  a slower  rate  than  revenue.  Higher  operating  costs  associ- 
ated with  data  center  equipment  and  software  upgrades  resulted  in  a 
decrease  in  income  from  operations  for  processing  services. 

• Revenue  for  the  six  months  ending  December  31,  1982  was  $18.2  million,  an 
increase  of  69%  over  $10.8  million  for  the  same  period  in  1981.  Net  income 
rose  81%  to  $1  million  from  $552,500  in  1981. 

• The  company  declared  a stock  split  on  February  8,  1983  to  be  distributed 
March  8,  1 983. 

• CDSI  is  organized  into  two  major  groups,  six  divisions,  and  a subsidiary  opera- 
tion. 


Professional  Services  Group: 

. The  Consulting/Systems  Development  Division  provides  clients 
with  a wide  variety  of  consulting,  systems  desiqn,  and  program- 
ming support.

• Management  attributes  its  success  in  FY  1980  to  growth  in  revenues  resulting 
from  major  contract  awards  from  the  federal  government  and  higher  profit 
margins  in  its  processing  services  segment. 

• The  only  year  CDSI's  profits  did  not  increase  in  the  last  five  years  was  in  1977. 
Profit  margins  were  impacted  by: 

Startup  costs  associated  with  a new  computer  center  and  the  purchase 

of  an  IBM  370/135. 

Development  costs  for  expansion  of  electronic  composition  and  finan- 
cial services  applications. 

A problem  contract. 

Acquisition  of  For  lines  and  Associates. 

• CDSI  is  organized  into  two  major  groups  and  six  divisions. 

Professional  Services  Group: 

. The  Consulting/Systems  Development  Division  provides  clients 
with  a wide  variety  of  consulting,  systems  design  and  program- 
ming support. 

. The  Communications  Systems  Division  provides  communications 
services  primarily  for  the  U.S.  Navy. 

Processing  Services  Group: 

. The  Financial  Services  Group  provides  clients  with  a broad 
spectrum  of  accounting  and  financial  system  services. 

. The  Information  Systems  Division  brings  system  design,  system 
development,  system  maintenance  and  production  processing 
services  together  in  a total  corporate  service  concept. 

. The  Electronic  Composition  Division  provides  electronic  photo- 
composition services  through  CDSI's  proprietary  Electronic  Ty- 
pography System  (ETS).

In  1973,  CDSI  created  a wholly  owned  subsidiary,  the  National  Institute 
For  Public  Services,  Inc.,  (NIPS),  which  published  a credit  union  newslet- 
ter and  Postal  World.  NIPS  was  subsequently  sold  in  1978  because  it 
diverted  too  much  management  attention  from  CDSI's  data  processing 
activities. 

Electronic  Composition,  Inc.,  (formerly  BNA  Research,  Inc.)  was  ac- 
quired in  1974.  This  acquisition  provided  the  basic  software  for  CDSI's 
existing  photocomposition  services. 

In  1976,  CDSI  acquired  Forlines  & Associates,  a firm  that  specialized  in 
financial  and  accounting  support  services.  At  the  time  of  acquisition, 
Forlines  had  sales  of  approximately  $250,000. 

• CDSI  employs  approximately  500  full-time  and  50  part-time  personnel. 

• Major  competitors  of  CDSI  are  Computer  Sciences,  Planning  Research  and 
other  large  and  small  companies  offering  programming  support  and  processing 
services. 


KEY  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

• Approximately  68%  of  CDSI's  FY  1980  revenues  were  derived  from  profes- 
sional services  and  32%  from  processing  services. 

• All  of  CDSI's  professional  services  revenues  are  derived  from  the  federal 
government. 

In  the  communications  area,  CDSI  has  experience  in  providing  commu- 
nications feasibility  studies,  requirements  analysis,  systems  develop- 
ment, configuration  management  and  operational  site  support  for  a 
range  of  automated  communications  systems. 

Additional  areas  of  application  expertise  include:  inventory,  personnel, 
membership,  financial,  health  and  resource  management  systems. 

Major  contracts  held  by  CDSI's  Professional  Services  Group  include: 

. A contract  with  the  U.S.  Navy  to  provide  communications 
software  services  in  support  of  the  Naval  Telecommunications 
Automation  Program.  Awarded  in  September  1979,  the  value  of 
the  contract  for  its  base  year  is  approximately  $3.5  million.  If 
the  four  one-year  options  are  exercised,  CDSI  will  receive 
additional  revenues  in  excess  of  $17  million. 

. The  Department  of  Energy  contracted  with  CDSI  in  December 
1978  to  support  its  activities  in  energy  data  collection  and 
reporting  to  Congress  and  the  public.  This  contract  has  contrib- 
uted more  than  $5  million  in  revenues  during  the  last  two  years.

INDUSTRY  MARKETS 

• Seventy  percent  of  revenue  is  derived  from  the  Federal  Government,  a 
decrease  of  25%  since  1973.  The  remaining  30%  of  revenues,  generated  by 
50%  to  70%  of  the  total  client  base,  comes  from  commercial  customers: 
lawyers,  associations,  construction  firms,  labor  unions,  and  publishing  houses. 

• Government  revenues  include  a $2  million  per  year  Navy  contract  for  a 
worldwide  communication  system.  This  is  a competitively  bid  contract 
renewable  every  three  years.  Although  CDSI  anticipates  it  will  retain  the 
contract,  its  loss  would  substantially  hurt  CDSI's  revenues. 


GEOGRAPHIC  MARKETS  Almost  all  revenues  are  generated  by  clients  in  the

COMPANY  BACKGROUND 

• Computer  Data  Systems,  Inc.  (CDSI)  was  founded  in  July  1968,  as  a 
Maryland  corporation.  It  is  traded  on  the  Boston  Stock  Exchange. 

• CDSI  provides  management  consulting,  information  systems  develop- 
ment, programming,  and  processing  services  to  approximately  100 
clients  in  the  federal,  state,  and  local  governments  and  the  private 
sector. 


OVERALL  ASSESSMENT 

• Profitable  since  1970,  the  company  had  $340,000  net  profit  in  1976. 
Despite  expected  lower  earnings  in  1977  due  to  the  purchase  of  an 
IBM  370/135,  CDSI  anticipates  fiscal  year  end  1977  revenues  of  $6.5 
million  to  be  profitable.  Prior  to  1977,  CDSI  leased  computer  time 
and  keypunch  services  from  other  vendors. 

• CDSI's  major  competitors  are  Planning  Research,  Computer  Sciences, 
American  Management  Systems,  Aztech,  Systems  Development  Cor- 
poration, Service  Bureau  Company,  and  Automatic  Data  Processing. 

• CDSI  has  two  wholly  owned  subsidiaries:  Electronic  Composition  Inc. 
(ECI)  provides  computerized  photocomposition  and  text  management 
services;  the  National  Institute  of  Public  Services  Inc.  (NIPS),  a 
publishing  services  organization,  provides  newsletters  for  credit 
unions  and  postal  users. 

• CDSI  made  two  acquisitions  in  1976: 

It  purchased  assets,  user  base,  products,  and  equipment  from 
Autocomp,  a photocomposition  company.  The  equipment,  an  IBM 
360/30,  was  subsequently  sold;  the  user  base  was  added  to  that 
of  ECI. 

CDSI  also  acquired  Forlines  and  Associates,  a batch  processing 
service  bureau.  This  acquisition  increased  CDSI's  data  processing 
user  base  and  added  three  services  to  CDSI's  current  offering: 
payroll,  fee  accounting  for  lawyers,  and  a building  information 
system.

INPUT 


• Approximately  60%  of  CDSI  revenues  is  generated  by  systems  design 
and  contract  programming  services  for  30  to  40  clients. 

• The  remaining  40%  of  revenues  is  generated  by  batch  processing, 
mailroom,  keypunching,  and  photocomposition  services  for  approx- 
imately 60  clients. 

• Specific  services  include  the  following: 

FARS  (Financial  Reporting  System).  Available  on  a service 
bureau  or  software  license  basis,  FARS  is  a complete  modular 
accounting  package  and  currently  has  10  to  12  users. 

Builders  Information  System,  with  8 users,  is  an  accounting  and 
management  system. 

ETS  (Electronic  Typesetting  System),  with  20  to  30  users, 
provides  complete  photocomposition  and  printing  services.  It  is 
available  as  service  or  package. 

Fee  accounting  for  lawyers  has  3 users. 

Mail  list  maintenance  and  membership  accounting  has  5 to  10 
users. 

Additional  services  include  payroll,  accounts  payable,  accounts 
receivable,  and  inventory. 

• Company  philosophy  dictates  offering  an  increasing  variety  of 
services  to  meet  client  needs.  At  present,  10%  of  CDSI's  clients  use 
more  than  one  service  and  the  company  expects  this  figure  to 
increase  steadily. 

Batch  processing  and  mailroom  services  are  primary  combi- 
nation. 

Photocomposition  will  have  increasing  significance  as  add-on 
service. 


APPLICATIONS  Ninety  percent  of  applications  revenues  is  generated  by 
general  business  processing,  including  accounting  and  inventory  control.  By 
year  end  1978,  this  will  decrease  to  80%  of  the  total  applications  revenues. 
Specialty  applications  - photocomposition,  text  editing,  and  communication 
systems  - will  increase  to  20%  from  their  current  10%  by  year  end  1978. 


INDUSTRY  MARKETS 

• Seventy  percent  of  revenues  is  derived  from  the  federal  government, 
a decrease  of  25%  since  1973.  The  remaining  30%  of  revenues, 
generated  by  60%  to  70%  of  the  total  client  base,  come  from 
commercial  customers:  lawyers,  associations,  construction  firms,  and 
publishing  houses.

Government  revenues  include  a $2  million  per  year  Navy 
contract  for  a worldwide  communication  system.  This  is  a 
competitively  bid  contract  renewable  every  three  years.  Al- 
though CDSI  anticipates  it  will  retain  the  contract,  its  loss  would 
substantially  hurt  CDSI's  revenues. 

The  company  also  has  several  other  large  contracts  ranging  from 
$500,000  to  $1  million  per  year  with  federal  government  agencies 
and  departments. 


GEOGRAPHIC  MARKETS  At  least  98%  of  total  revenues  is  generated  by 
clients  in  the  Washington,  D.C.  area.  The  remaining  revenues  are 
distributed  throughout  the  country.

THE  COMPANY 

• Computer  Dynamics  Inc.  (CDI)  was  incorporated  in  California  about  1967. 
Between  1967  and  1974  several  acquisitions  were  made  to  expand  its  computer 
services  capability.  In  1974  CDI  was  acquired  by  Central  Banking  Systems, 
Inc.  CDI  currently  provides  mainly  processing  services,  turnkey  systems  and 
some  professional  services  to  financial  institutions. 

• Revenues  for  fiscal  1978  are  expected  to  remain  approximately  the  same  as 
for  fiscal  1977. 

Management  states  that  CDI  is  profitable. 

Central  Banking  Systems,  the  parent  company,  generates  about  60%

time  sales  are  provided  to  about  20  additional  users.  Non-captive  revenues  of 
approximately  $2  million  for  fiscal  1977  were  generated  by  the  following  types 
of  computer  services: 

Processing  services,  both  batch  and  remote  batch. 

Professional  services.

• Processing  services  consist  of  such  financial  and  accounting  applications  as 
general  ledger,  accounts  receivable,  accounts  payable,  fixed  asset  accounting, 
and  computation  of  interest  on  installment  loans  and  savings  accounts. 

The  majority  of  applications  are  specialized  and  targeted  at  banks  and 
credit  unions. 

Medical  practitioners  are  the  target  of  an  accounts  receivable  appli- 
cations package  that  has  been  tailored  to  their  needs. 

Sale  of  raw  computer  time  to  a variety  of  users  accounts  for  about  15% 
of  revenues. 

• Professional  services  consist  of  contract  programming  and  systems  design  of 
financial  and  accounting  applications,  primarily  for  the  parent  company. 

• Turnkey  systems  provide  similar  financial  and  accounting  applications  to 
credit  unions  and  medical  practitioners  as  are  available  through  CDI's 
processing  services. 

About  12  turnkey  systems  were  installed  at  the  end  of  fiscal  1977  and 
an  additional  eight  are  expected  to  be  installed  by  the  end  of  1978. 
Management  expects  turnkey  systems  to  represent  a growing  share  of 
CDI's  revenues. 

DEC  I 1/70  and  DEC  PDP-8  CPUs  are  purchased  on  an  OEM  basis  and 
enhanced  with  financial  applications  software  prior  to  resale. 

• Occasionally  CDI  markets  a software  product  called  CDI  Letter  writer  for 
direct  mail  applications;  however,  this  contributes  a negligible  amount  of 
revenues.

• Approximately  80%  of  CES  revenues  are  generated  by  the  manufacture  and 
sale  of  computer  hardware  and  peripheral  equipment  for  tabulating  election 
results.  CES  buys  many  components;  assembles  and  builds  interfaces  for  them. 
Its  Texas  manufacturing  plant  makes  the  two-stub  ballot  card,  called 
Portapunch.  Principal  hardware  products  include: 

Votomatic,  CES's  oldest  products. 

Ballot  Tab,  a desk  top  vote  counter. 

Alpha  Ballot  Tab,  an  extension  of  Ballot  Tab,  which  provides  alphabetic 
characters  as  well  as  numerals  in  tabulating  results  (e.g.,  candidate 
names). 

Ballot  Multiplexer  System,  a card-to-tape  system  used  by  large  voter 
jurisdictions  to  speed  the  tabulating  process.

• The  20%  of  revenues  from  computer  services  are  generated  by  software 
products,  turnkey  systems,  and  professional  services.  The  balance  of  this 
report  focuses  upon  CES's  services  business. 


KEY  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

• Computer  services  to  approximately  575  city  and  county  governments  and

EL70  performs  ballot  counting  on  IBM  equipment. 

EL80  performs  ballot  counting  on  non-IBM  equipment. 

Available  under  nondisclosure  licensing. 

Users  have  the  option  of  maintaining  the  software  themselves  or  having 
CES  do  it.  Maintenance  principally  consists  of  modifying  the  software 
before  each  election  to  reflect  current  candidates  and  issues  to  be 
voted  upon. 

• Turnkey  systems,  a recent  addition  to  the  CES  product  line,  are,  according  to 
management,  the  fastest  growing  segment  of  the  firm.  CES  OEM-purchases

a transition  from  being  a contract 


programming  shop  to  a provider  of  a range

transitioning  the  company  from  a contract 
programming  shop  to  a provider  of  a range

A key  challenge  for  the  company  is 
competing  with  larger,  more  established 
companies  in  this  price-sensitive  market.

(a)  Restated  to  reflect  a 3-for-2  stock  split  in  March  1993. 


Revenue  increases  during  1992  were  due  to  year-over-year  volume 
improvement  and  the  acquisition  of  Worldwide  Computer  Services. 
Previously,  1991  revenue  had  declined  by  5%  as  compared  to  1991, 
primarily  the  result  of  an  employment  and  cost  reduction  attitude 
prevalent  among  large  companies  during  the  recessionary  economic 
climate  which  emerged  in  late  1990. 

• The  commercial/industrial  market  segment  continues  to  be  the 
company's  largest,  representing  69%  ($70.5  million)  of  1992  revenue. 
The  business  is  broad-based,  with  particular  emphasis  in  utilities, 
transportation,  energy,  and  health  care. 

• IBM  business  decreased  to  15%  ($15.3  million)  of  total  revenues  in 
1992,  from  21%  ($19.4  million)  in  1991.  The  principal  reason  stems 
from  a technical  change  in  the  billing  procedure.

• Financial  services  revenue  returned  to  growth  in  1992,  particularly 
the  insurance  segment. 

• Communications  revenues,  after  declining  for  three  years,  improved 
to  16%  of  total  revenue  in  1992.  This  trend  change  was  due  to 
increased  business  with  AT&T  and  contracts  associated  with  the 
Worldwide  Computer  Services  acquisition. 

Declines  in  net  income  in  1992  were  due  to  continued  increased  selling, 
general,  and  administrative  costs  associated  with  forming  the  Horizons 
Consulting  subsidiary. 

Revenue  for  the  three  months  ending  March  31,  1993  reached  $29.4 
million,  compared  to  $24.3  million  for  the  same  period  in  1992.  Net 
income  was  $858,000,  compared  to  $774,000  for  the  same  period  a year 
ago.

Revenue  increases  during  1990  were  due  primarily  to  the  growth  in 
the  commercial/industrial  market  segment  which  continues  to  be 
the  company's  largest,  representing  64%  of  1990  revenue  and  55% 
of  1989  revenue.  This  business  is  broad-based,  with  particular 
positive  impact  from  Computer  Horizons'  strength  in  the  Midwest, 
as  well  as  its  emphasis  on  systems  integration  partnering  and  project 
work. 

• Financial  services  market  segment  revenue  declined  slightly 
during  1990  due  primarily  to  continued  weakness  in  the

significantly  during  1989  due  to  internal  growth  and  acquisitions. 

. Communications  market  segment  revenues  have  declined  as  a 
percent  of  total  revenue  from  35%in  1987  to  19%  in  1990.  These 
reduced  levels  are  attributed  to  lower  levels  of  business  with 
AT&T.

Operating  results  for  1988  were  less  than  anticipated,  primarily 
because  of  the  premature  termination  of  two  sizable  consulting 
projects  early  in  the  third  quarter. 

Revenue  for  the  six  months  ending  June  30,  1989  reached  nearly 
$40.5  million,  a 4%  increase  over  $38.9  million  for  the  same 
period  in  1988.  Net  income  totaled  $513,000,  compared  to  $1.4 
million  for  the  same  period  a year  ago. 

• Computer  Horizons  experienced  reduced  revenue  from  the 
communications  sector,  though  financial  services  and  industrial 
revenues  grew. 

• Although  revenue  from  the  Midwest  region  grew,  revenue  from 
the  Mid-Atlantic  and  Southern  regions  experienced  weakness. 

Acquisitions  made  by  Computer  Horizons  include  the  following: 

• In  May  1989,  Computer  Horizons  acquired  the  Professional

• CHC  attributes  its  15%  increase  in  revenue  to  rapid  growth  in  two  of  its 
industry  markets— industrial/manufacturing  and  financial  services— mitigated 
by  a 12.8%  decline  in  its  third  major  industry  market— communications. 

• CHC  attributes  its  decline  in  profit  margin  (from  8.9%  in  fiscal  1986  to  7.7% 
in  fiscal  1987)  to  administrative  expenses  of  opening  new  offices  and  to  wage 
increases  for  the  consulting  staff  that  were  not  entirely  offset  by  price 
increases.  The  company  places  particular  emphasis  on  price  competition  as  a 
factor  contributing  to  declining  profit  margins. 

• Recent  acquisitions  made  by  CHC  include  the  following: 

In  December  1985  CHC  acquired  Marco  Computer  Services,  Inc.,  a data 
processing  professional  services  firm  based  in  Minneapolis. 

On  December  II,  1986,  CHC  announced  the  acquisition  of  a start-up 
professional  services  venture  with  annual  revenue  around  $3  million.

On  December  31,  1986  CHC  purchased  the  data  processing  consulting 
business  of  InfoGroup,  Inc.,  a Detroit-based  private  company,  for  $5.2 
million  plus  contingent  payments  based  on  future  performance. 

On  March  4,  1987  CHC  purchased  ComputerKnowledge,  a Dallas-based 
software  training  and  education  services  company  for  $650,000  in  cash.

Computer  Horizons'  management  attributes  the  increase  in  revenue  to  the 
broadening  of  their  customer  base  beyond  the  communications  and  financial 
services  industries  with  significant  contributions  to  revenue  growth  from  the 
utility  and  manufacturing  sectors.  Decreases  in  net  income  and  earnings  per 
share  are  attributed  to  higher  direct  costs  associated  with  pricing  pressures 
and  higher  selling,  administrative,  and  general  expenses  associated  with  the 
addition  of  eight  new  district  offices  and  the  addition  of  several  senior 
managers  to  direct  certain  corporate  and  regional  activities.

COMPUTER  INFORMATION  SYSTEMS 


With  Quantum  RS'  user-defined  reports,  system  managers  can  examine 
combinations  of  over  35  performance  and  statistical  measures  and  30 
resources.  Key  statistics  include: 

. CPU  to  connect  time  ratio. 

. Page  fault  rate  and  page  fault  I/O  rate. 

. Direct  and  buffered  I/O  rates. 

. Percentage  of  CPU  used,  average  number  of  users. 

. Images  executed  per  hour,  interactive  processes  per  day, 
subprocesses  per  day,  and  log-in  failures  per  day. 

Four  user-defined  reports  are  described  below: 

. The  Resource  Report  reports  on  any  of  the  35  resources  that  are 
tracked  in  the  system  and,  if  desired,  their  associated  sales 
figures. 

. The  Hourly  Resource  Data  Display  produces  bar  graphs  showing 
resource  usage  on  an  hourly  basis.  Peak  usage  periods  can 
therefore  be  calculated. 

. The  Resource  Analysis  Report  provides  system  managers  with 
over  30  statistics  for  measuring  machine  usage.  The  informa- 
tion identifies  hardware  that  may  be  running  at  maximum 
capacity  and  that  might  need  expansion  of  modifications. 

By  showing  resource  utilization  trends,  the  Resource  Trend 
Report  helps  the  system  manager  predict  the  point  of  resource 
saturation  and  anticipate  the  need  to  buy  additional  equipment. 

System  requirements  for  Quantum  RS  include: 

. CPU:  VAX  with  a minimum  of  512  kb  of  memory. 

Disk  Storage:  Approximately  14,000  blocks  for  the  program, 

plus  data  storage. 

Operating  System:  VAX/VMS  Version  4.0  or  later. 

Terminal  Requirements:  DEC  VTXXX  series  are  required  to  run 
the  screen-oriented  portion  of  the  Data  Display  program. 

. Distribution  Medium:  Standard  medium  is  9-track 

800/1600/6250  BPI  magnetic  tape— also  available  on  RL02  at  an 
additional  charge. 

No  prerequisite  software  required  (other  than  VMS). 

. No  language  compiler  required. 

. User  installation. 

The  price  for  Quantum  RS  ranges  from  $2,500  (microcomputer  version) 
to  $12,000  (VAX  mainframe  license).  There  have  been  approximately 
500  installations  of  the  product  since  its  introduction  in  1984. 
Quantum  RS  sales  in  I 985  increased  250%  from  the  previous  year.

bar,  energy  management,  point  of  sale,  and  central  reservations 
systems  and  its  own  yield  management  system.  Interfaces  are 
being  developed  to  link  properties  to  their  banks  for  automated 
cash  transfers,  to  their  reservations  sources  via  two  way 
information  exchange,  and  to  each  other  via  transparent 
networks  linking  central  management  to  properties. 

CLS'  1988  revenue  reached  $21  million,  a 40%  increase  over  1987 
revenue  of  $15  million.  CLS  management  states  that  the  company 
has  been  profitable  for  the  past  14  years  and  anticipates  that 
revenues  will  increase  by  approximately  28% -during  1989.

Description 

ComputerLand  is  a worldwide  provider  of  service  and  support  to 
corporate  computing  clients,  offering  network  integration,  technical 
help  desk  services,  computer  training,  and  systems  maintenance 
services. 

ComputerLand  manages  over  400  full-service  locations  in  the  U.S.,  and 
claims  to  be  the  world's  largest  multivendor  computer  reseller  network. 
ComputerLand  Corporation  has  branches  in  40  countries,  specializing 
in  the  planning,  design,  installation,  and  maintenance  of  complex 
networks  to  meet  business  needs. 

Company  History 

ComputerLand  announced  a business  reorganization  in  October  1992, 
which  will  emphasize  company-owned  services  and  sales  while  still 
supporting  franchising  and  distribution  to  independent  resellers. 

In  the  new  company  structure,  ComputerLand  created  two  divisions 
dedicated  to  specific  segments  of  the  business.  The  new  corporate 
division  will  manage  the  company-owned  network  of  branches  in  major 
metropolitan  areas.  The  franchise  and  distribution  division  will  focus 
on  franchisees  and  independent  Datago  affiliates.  There  are  a total  of 
120  company-owned  and  300  franchisee-owned  ComputerLand  outlets 
in  the  U.S.  The  company,  one  of  the  largest  computer  resellers,  also 
formed  a third  group  to  support  the  two  divisions. 

Financials 

ComputerLand's  fiscal  1992  worldwide  revenues  were  $2.6  billion,  with 
U.S.  revenue  reaching  $1.8  billion.  INPUT  estimates  that  15%  of  U.S. 
1992  revenue  was  from  information  services. 

Acquisitions 

In  July  1992,  reseller  ComputerLand  completed  its  acquisition  of  one  of 
the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area's  largest  computer  resellers,  Infomax,  Inc. 
Infomax,  of  Concord,  CA,  had  revenues  of  $150  million.  This 
acquisition  of  a ComputerLand  franchise  is  part  of  ComputerLand's 
nationwide  strategy  to  buy  back  some  of  its  franchises  in  major 
metropolitan  areas. 

In  May  1992,  ComputerLand  announced  the  purchase  of  TRW's 
Customer  Service  Division  (TRW  CSD).  TRW  CSD  reported  1991 
revenues  of  approximately  $110  million,  with  over  13,000  service 
customers.  The  acquisition  was  finalized  July  3,  1992.  This  acquisition 
gives  ComputerLand  access  to  federal  markets. 

Total  1992  U.S.  revenue  for  ComputerLand  services  revenue  before  the 
acquisition  was  $180  million.  ComputerLand  estimates  that  the

Computer  Language  Research  (CLR)  has  substantially  completed 
the  retooling  of  its  tax  systems  from  a mainframe  to  microcomputer 
environment,  establishing  itself  as  a supplier  of  advanced  network- 
based  software  rather  than  a mainframe  processor  of  tax  returns. 

During  1992,  CLR  acquired  Fiduciary  Tax  Systems  (FTS)  from  CCH 
Computax,  significantly  expanding  the  number  of  bank  trust  tax 
departments  using  CLR  systems  and  services. 

CLR  has  introduced,  EasyGo,  a new  software  product  targeted  at 
small  to  medium  size  accounting  firms.

Acquisitions 


Revenue  from  the  tax  business  segment  decreased  8%  from  $106 
million  in  1991  to  $97.7  million  in  1992  due  to  lower  prices  for  tax 
processing  services,  lower  systems  sales,  and  tax  processing  software 
problems  encountered  in  early  1992  in  the  accounting  tax  market. 

• Lower  prices  for  tax  processing  services  resulted  from  competitive 
pressures  and  a change  in  mix  from  mainframe  to  in-house  tax 
processing. 

• These  declines  were  partially  offset  by  increased  sales  volume  in  the 
bank  tax  market  due  to  the  acquisition  of  FTS  Corporation  (which 
contributed  $2.2  million  to  CLR's  1992  revenue)  and  increased 
product  success. 

• It  is  anticipated  that  revenue  will  continue  to  decline  in  the 
accounting  tax  market,  partially  offset  by  revenue  growth  in  the 
other  tax  markets. 

• Operating  profits  in  the  tax  business  segment  were  $12.9  million  in 
1992,  compared  to  $11.8  million  in  1991. 

Electronic  form  systems  revenue  increased  37%  to  $13.3  million  due  to 
significantly  higher  systems  sales.  Operating  profit  was  $400,000  in 
1992,  compared  to  a $1.2  million  loss  in  1991. 

Research  and  development  expenses  were  approximately  $4.2  million 
in  1992,  $3.0  million  in  1991,  and  $4.0  million  in  1990. 

Revenue  for  the  three  months  ending  March  31,  1993  was  $34.5 
million,  compared  to  $36.8  million  for  the  same  period  in  1992.  Net 
income  was  $4.6  million,  compared  to  $11.4  million  for  the  same  period 
a year  ago,  which  includes  $5.7  million  for  the  cumulative  effect  of  a 
change  in  the  method  of  accounting. 


In  July  1992,  CLR  acquired  FTS  Corporation  from  CCH  Computax, 
Inc.  for  approximately  $7.5  million.  The  acquisition  was  accounted  for 
as  a purchase. 

• FTS,  with  27  employees  and  1991  revenue  of  approximately  $7.3 
million,  provides  computerized  trust  tax  processing  services  for 
banks. 

• The  operations  of  FTS  have  been  merged  into  CLR's  tax  operations.

Since  1965,  CLR  has  implemented  four  generations  of  technology  for 
processing  tax  returns.  Although  all  four  are  still  offered  by  the 
company,  the  trend  is  away  from  mainframe  tax  processing  and  toward 
client  in-house  microcomputer  processing: 

• Service  Bureau  Tax  Processing:  Clients  submit  input  forms  to  a 
local  Fast-Tax  service  center  for  mainframe  batch  processing.  CLR 
enters  the  data  and  computes  and  prints  the  final  return.  Currently, 
mainframe  processing  is  being  replaced  by  a system  of  networked 
microcomputers  called  the  GoCenter.  The  Go  Center  is  an  array  of 
486  microcomputers,  file  servers,  and  large  hard  disks  linked  to 
provide  parallel  computing  and  data  storage.  It  is  used  to  process 
tax  returns  for  clients  who  require  service  bureau  processing. 

• On-Line  Tax  Processing:  Clients  control  the  entire  production 
process  for  their  returns  from  a terminal  in  their  office,  while  still 
relying  on  CLR  for  original  data  entry  and  high  speed  laser  printing. 

• Client  Data  Input  Tax  Processing  (Production  System):  Clients  key 
data  from  input  forms,  transmit  the  data  to  CLR's  GoCenter  for 
computation,  and  print  the  finished  returns  on  laser  printers  located 
in  their  offices.  The  Production  System  was  renamed  Production 
System  2 in  1992  to  reflect  its  advanced  capabilities  and  its  delivery 
via  CD  ROM. 

• Client  In-House  Tax  Processing  Software:  GoSystem,  introduced  in 
1987,  is  a microcomputer-based  software  product  that  processes  tax 
returns  completely  in-house.  In  1992,  this  software  was  renamed 
GoSystem  2 to  reflect  its  upgraded  capabilities  as  a complete 
electronic  tax  desktop  that  includes  fully  integrated  compliance,  tax 
research,  tax  planning,  and  tax  practice  management. 

- The  GoSystem  runs  on  IBM  AT  or  PS/2  series  microcomputers. 
It  is  designed  to  run  in  a local-area  environment,  but  can  operate 
on  a standalone  basis. 

- EasyGo,  introduced  in  1992,  is  a standalone,  in-house  tax 
automation  system  for  smaller  accounting  firms  that  do  not 
require  all  the  features  of  GoSystem  2. 

- CLR  has  linked  GoSystem  and  EasyGo  software  to  the  OnPoint 
electronic  tax  research  data  base  offered  by  Research  Institute  of 
America. 

- System  5 is  a version  of  GoSystem  2 for  the  corporate  tax  market. 
System  5 automates  the  tax  compliance  and  planning  efforts  of 
large  and  medium  corporations  with  internal  tax  departments. 
Fixed  asset  and  management  modules  were  added  during  1992.

• CLR  also  offers  Investor  Relations  Workstation,  a microcomputer- 
based  investor  information  retrieval  system  that  uses  optical  disk 
technology. 

CLR  provides  fiduciary  tax  processing  services  to  banks  with  internal 
trust  departments. 

• Due  to  the  large  volume  of  returns  prepared,  bank  clients 
customarily  provide  monthly  taxpayer  data  to  CLR  on  magnetic  tape 
or  via  electronic  transmission. 

• The  trust  accounting  data  is  generally  bridged  to  CLR  from  the 
bank's  internal  trust  accounting  system  or  from  third-party  suppliers 
of  trust  accounting  services. 

• Data  may  be  bridged  at  year-end  for  annual  tax  reporting  (Standard 
Bridge  service)  or  monthly  (Detail  Bridge  service). 

• SmartBridge,  for  Detail  Bridge  clients,  uses  expert  system 
technology  to  analyze  trust  tax  transactions. 

• The  Estimate  Analysis  SYstem  (EASY)  allows  bank  trust 
departments  to  comply  with  electronic  filing  rules  imposed  by  the 
IRS. 

In  1992,  CLR  released  E-Form,  a CD  ROM-based  tax  form  retrieval 
system  designed  to  completely  replace  a tax  professional's  printed  tax 
form  service.  E-Form  operates  under  Microsoft  Windows  and  includes 
over  15,000  pages  of  tax-related  forms  and  instructions.  Forms  can  be 
viewed  and  completed  on-screen  then  either  printed  blank  or 
completed.  Completed  forms  can  be  store  on  the  user's  hard  disk. 

CLR's  Electronic  Forms  Systems  (EFS)  business  contributed  12%  to 
1992  revenue.  EFS  enables  clients  to  electronically  print  forms  on 
blank  paper,  eliminating  the  need  for  a large  inventory  of  preprinted 
forms,  reproduction  facilities,  and  collation  equipment. 

• An  electronic  image  of  each  form  is  stored  in  the  computer  and 
displayed  on  various  display  devices  when  and  where  needed. 

■ EFS  software  is  available  for  IBM  and  compatible  mainframes  and 
microcomputers.

The  Company  Computer  Language  Research,  Inc.  (CLR),  founded  in  1964, 

provides  tax  processing  services,  software  products,  and  turnkey 
systems  to  major  accounting  firms,  corporations,  partnerships,  and 
banks  under  the  trade  name  Fast-TaxR. 

• CLR  also  markets  electronic  forms  automation  software  and 
equipment  for  use  in  its  tax  processing  activities  and  to  other 
forms-intensive  businesses  such  as  insurance  companies, 
mortgage  banks,  financial  services  organizations,  and  federal  and 
state  governments. 

• CLR  is  a large  Industry  Remarketer  for  IBM  and  a value-added 
reseller  for  various  other  manufacturers. 

Over  the  past  five  years,  CLR  has  been  implementing  a program  to 
retool  its  mainframe  tax  processing  system  to  operate  on  networked 
microcomputers. 

• During  this  period,  the  company  has  invested  nearly  $85  million 
in  tax-related  product  development,  including  expenses 
associated  with  maintaining  parallel  mainframe  and  network- 
based  tax  systems. 

• In  anticipation  of  the  downsizing  of  its  mainframe  capacity,  CLR 
reduced  permanent  employment  as  of  the  end  of  1990  by 
approximately  200  employees.  CLR  also  recorded  a $5.1  million 
restructuring  charge  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  1990.  The  charge 
provides  reserves  for  the  excess  capacity  that  will  no  longer  be 
needed  once  all  tax  systems  are  moved  to  the  newer  network 
technology. 

• When  the  transition  from  mainframe  to  network  computing  is 
complete,  CLR  management  expects  total  employment  to 
decline  by  over  30%  from  its  peak.  The  company  also  expects 
significant  reductions  in  nonlabor  expenses.  With  its  new

technology,  returns  that  are  submitted  to  CLR  for  processing  will 
be  processed  through  networked  microcomputers  rather  than  an

CLR's  1990  revenue  was  $119.4  million,  a 5%  decrease  from  1989 
revenue  of  $126.1  million.  Net  losses  were  $4.5  million,  compared

CLR  management  attributes  1990  results  to  the  following: 

• CLR's  tax  business  contributed  $109.0  million  to  1990  revenue 
and  had  $1.7  million  in  operating  profit,  compared  to  1989 
revenue  of  $116.5  million  and  operating  profit  of  12.9  million. 

- Lower  revenues  were  attributed  to  a reduction  in  average 
prices  for  processing  income  tax  returns  and  lower  tax- 
processing systems  sales.

- Lower  prices  for  tax  processing  resulted  primarily  from  a 
change  in  mix  from  mainframe  to  in-house  tax  processing.  In- 
house  processing  results  in  lower  prices  per  tax  return  to  CLR 
because  more  data  entry  and  printing  responsibilities  are 
transferred  to  the  client. 

- Future  price  declines  are  expected  due  to  the  migration  of 
CLR's  tax  business  from  the  traditional  mainframe  service 
bureau  approach  to  the  micro-based  approach  and 
competitive  pressures  from  the  marketplace  as  the  power  of 
microcomputer-based  systems  increases. 

• The  electronic  forms  systems  business  had  1990  revenue  of  $10.4 
million  and  operating  losses  of  $3.9  million,  compared  to  1989 
revenue  of  $9.6  million  and  operating  losses  of  $6.8  million. 
Higher  revenues  resulted  mainly  from  forms  software  and 
services  sold  to  insurance  companies. 

Total  product  development  expenditures  were  $23.3  million  in  1990, 
$21.6  million  in  1989,  and  $20.1  million  in  1988. 

Revenue  for  the  three  months  ending  March  31,  1991  was  $39.3 
million,  a 10%  decrease  from  $43.5  million  for  the  same  period  in 
1990.  Net  income  was  $7  million,  compared  to  $5.6  million  for  the 
same  period  a year  ago.  Cost  reductions  of  $6.6  million  were 
primarily  due  to  internal  adjustments  made  to  accommodate  the 
move  to  client  in-house  tax  processing  and  the  continuation  of  cost 
containment  programs  set  in  place  during  1990. 

During  the  first  quarter  of  1991,  CLR  made  the  following 
acquisitions: 

• Wenz  Systems,  Inc.,  a company  specializing  in  the  bank  tax 
market 

• The  Freedom  Group,  a software  product  line  for  the  insurance 
tax  market 

As  of  December  31,  1990,  CLR  had  1,232  permanent  full-time 
employees.  The  company  also  employs  more  than  200  temporary 
employees  in  operations  and  customer  service  during  its  peak  tax 
processing  season  in  March  and  April. 

Major  competitors  include  CCH  Computax  (a  subsidiary  of 
Commerce  Clearing  House),  as  well  as  various  regional  and  local 
income  tax  return  processors.

Key  Products  and 
Services 


Approximately  91%  ($109.0  million)  of  CLR's  1990  revenue  was 
derived  from  tax  return-related  processing  and  software  products. 
The  remaining  9%  ($10.4  million)  of  revenue  was  derived  from 
electronic  forms  software  and  laser  printer  systems. 

CLR  currently  provides  products  and  services  in  two  basic  markets: 
the  ATM  (Accounting  Tax  Market),  which  provides  products  and 
services  for  medium-to-large  CPA  firms;  and  the  BTM  (Business 
Tax  Market),  which  offers  products  and  services  for  corporations, 
partnerships,  banks,  and  trusts.  CLR  currently  provides  tax 
processing  products  for  more  than  5,000  accounting  firms,  financial 
institutions,  and  major  corporations. 

Since  1965,  CLR  has  introduced  four  generations  of  technology  for 
processing  tax  returns.  Although  all  four  are  still  offered  by  the 
company,  the  trend  is  away  from  mainframe  tax  processing  and 
toward  client  location  microcomputer  processing: 

• Mainframe  Tax  Processing:  Clients  submit  input  forms  to  a local 
Fast-Tax  service  center  for  batch  processing.  CLR  enters  the 
data  and  computes  and  prints  the  final  return,  providing  48-hour 
turnaround  in  most  major  cities. 

• On-Line  Tax  Processing:  Clients  use  a terminal  or 
microcomputer  in  their  offices  to  enter  reruns  on-line,  determine 
the  status  of  returns,  or  revise  processing  instructions.  CLR 
provides  the  original  data  entry  and  printing. 

• Client  Data  Input  Tax  Processing  (Production  System):  Clients 
key  data  from  input  forms,  transmit  the  data  to  Fast-Tax  data 
centers  for  computation,  and  print  the  finished  returns  on  laser 
printers  located  in  their  offices. 

• GoSystem:  Introduced  in  1987,  GoSystem  is  a microcomputer- 
based  software  product  that  processes  tax  returns  completely  in- 
house.  A version  of  the  system  is  also  available  for  the  corporate 
tax  market  (System  5). 

- The  GoSystem  runs  on  IBM  AT  or  PS/2  series 
microcomputers.  It  is  designed  to  run  in  a local-area 
environment,  but  can  operate  on  a standalone  basis. 

- CLR  provides  all  equipment  and  training  required. 

CLR  offers  mainframe-based  processing,  the  Production  System, 
and  the  GoSystem  to  accounting  firms  nationwide.

• During  1990,  CLR  negotiated  long-term  agreements  with  two 
international  Big  6 accounting  firms  to  implement  the  GoSystem 
on  a firmwide  basis  over  the  next  three  years.  In  addition,  CLR 
extended  its  agreement  with  KPMG  Peat  Marwick  for  another 
five  years. 

• Tax  processing  products  and  services  are  available  to  accounting 
firms  that  prepare  expatriate  returns  for  U.S.  citizens  temporarily 
living  abroad.  CLR  supports  clients  in  over  40  cities  located  in 
25  foreign  countries. 

• CLR  also  offers  tax  department  local-area  network  (LAN) 
solutions  for  CPA  firms,  including  LAN  consulting  and  design, 
equipment,  operating  software,  installation,  training,  and 
support. 

• CLR  provides  Network  Control  Center  (NCC),  a LAN  package 
that  may  include  modems,  file  servers,  optional  attached 
processors,  and  an  uninterrupted  power  supply  in  a single 
cabinet.  NCC  was  designed  for  use  with  the  GoSystem,  but  also 
processes  most  IBM-compatible  software  applications.  NCC  is 
marketed  primarily  to  medium  and  large  accounting  firms  with  a 
large  number  of  users  who  can  benefit  from  the  economies  of  a 
LAN  and  distributed  processing. 

For  the  corporate  tax  market,  CLR  offers  System  5,  a family  of 

microcomputer-based  products  designed  to  automate  the  tax 

compliance  and  planning  efforts  of  large  and  medium  corporations 

with  internal  tax  departments. 

• System  5 includes  software  to  process  federal  single-company 
and  consolidated  returns,  state  single-company  and  combined 
reports.  System  5 also  includes  software  to  process  sales-and-use 
tax  returns  for  over  250  state  and  local  taxing  jurisdictions,  as 
well  as  modules  for  corporate  tax  planning  under  the 
requirements  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board 
Statement  96  and  for  international  tax  planning  and  compliance. 

• Modules  released  for  the  insurance  industry  include  Insurance 
Tax  Compliance  Software  (ITCS)  and  Automated  Premium  Tax 
Software  (APT). 

• Over  200  corporations  switched  to  System  5 during  1990  in 
addition  to  the  200  that  switched  in  1989.  To  date,  over  900 
corporate  tax  departments  use  System  5. 

• CLR's  mainframe  tax  processing  services  enable  corporations  to 
offload  the  labor-intensive  data  entry  and  print  activities.  Input

forms  are  filled  out  by  the  client  and  mailed  to  CLR  for 
processing.  The  data  is  keyed  and  computed,  and  a consolidated 
corporate  return  is  printed  by  CLR.  Clients  can  control  the 
production  process  and  make  changes  on-line  from 
microcomputers  located  in  the  offices. 

CLR  also  provides  tax  return  and  K-l  processing  services  to  large 
partnerships,  including  syndications  and  Master  Limited 
Partnerships. 

• Services  include  a system  designed  to  assist  in  the  production  and 
distribution  of  investor  information.  During  1990,  over  two 
million  investor  packages  were  produced. 

• CLR  also  offers  Investor  Relations  Workstation,  a 
microcomputer-based  investor  information  retrieval  system  that 
uses  optical  disk  technology. 

CLR  provides  fiduciary  tax  processing  services  to  banks  with 
internal  trust  departments. 

■ Due  to  the  large  volume  of  returns  prepared,  bank  clients 
customarily  provide  monthly  taxpayer  data  to  CLR  on  magnetic 
tape  or  via  electronic  transmission. 

• The  trust  accounting  data  is  generally  bridged  to  CLR  from  the 
bank's  internal  trust  accounting  system  or  from  third-party 
suppliers  of  trust  accounting  services. 

• Data  may  be  bridged  at  year-end  for  annual  tax  reporting 
(Standard  Bridge  service)  or  monthly  (Detail  Bridge  service). 

• SmartBridge  is  a new  product  for  Detail  Bridge  clients  that  uses 
expert  system  technology  to  analyze  trust  tax  transactions. 

• The  Estimate  Analysis  SYstem  (EASY)  allows  bank  trust 
departments  to  comply  with  electronic  filing  rules  imposed  by  the 
IRS  in  1988. 

CLR's  Electronic  Forms  Systems  (EFS)  business  contributed  9%  to 
1990  revenue.  EFS  enables  clients  to  electronically  print  forms  on 
blank  paper,  eliminating  the  need  for  a large  inventory  of 
preprinted  forms,  reproduction  facilities,  and  collation  equipment. 

• An  electronic  image  of  each  form  is  stored  in  the  computer  and 
displayed  on  various  display  devices  when  and  where  needed.

CLR  management  attributes  revenue  growth  during  1988  to 
increased  sales  in  all  tax  markets  and  increased  sales  of  electronic 
forms  systems. 

• CLR's  tax  business  contributed  $105.7  million  to  1988  revenue 
and  had  $7.7  million  in  operating  profit,  compared  to  1987 
revenue  of  $92.8  million  and  operating  profit  of  $8.1  million. 

• The  electronic  forms  systems  business  had  1988  revenue  of 
$11.7  million  and  operating  losses  of  nearly  $8  million, 
compared  to  1987  revenue  of  $9.3  million  and  operating  losses 
of  $7.4  million. 

Net  losses  were  attributed  primarily  to  the  following: 

• Operating  results  for  the  past  three  years  reflect  a continued 
transition  of  the  company's  CPA  tax  market  from  mainframe  to 
microcomputer  technology.  Prices  for  CLR's  mainframe

technology  were  dropping  as  clients  moved  to  the  new 
microcomputer  technology. 

• Recognizing  this  trend,  CLR  began  to  retool  its  mainframe  tax 
processing  software,  resulting  in  the  introduction  of  the 
GoSystem  for  microcomputers  in  May  1987. 

• Total  product  development  expenditures  were  $20.1  million  in 
1988  compared  to  $17.8  million  in  1987.  The  higher 
expenditures  in  1988  were  the  result  of  continued  development 
of  tax  processing  microcomputer  software  and  the  initial 
development  expenditures  for  the  company's  local  area  network 
products. 

• Selling,  general,  and  administrative  costs  were  $41.4  million  in 
1988,  compared  to  $31.5  million  in  1987.  The  increase 
principally  reflects  CLR's  expanded  sales  and  marketing  efforts 
for  its  electronic  forms  systems  and  tax  products. 

Revenue  for  the  nine  months  ending  September  30,  1989  reached 
$92.7  million,  an  8%  increase  over  $86  million  for  the  same  period 
in  1988.  Net  income  was  $864,000,  compared  to  a net  loss  of  $2.2 
million  for  the  same  period  a year  ago. 

During  1988,  CLR  sold  its  Micro-Tax  software  product  line. 

As  of  December  31,  1988,  CLR  had  1,472  permanent  full-time 
employees.  The  company  also  employs  more  than  200  temporary 
employees  in  operations  and  customer  service  during  its  peak  tax 
processing  season  in  March  and  April. 

Major  competitors  include  CCH  Computax  (a  subsidiary  of 
Commerce  Clearing  House),  as  well  as  various  regional  and  local 
income  tax  return  processors. 


Key  Products  and  INPUT  estimates  approximately  72%  of  CLR's  1988  revenue  was 
Services  derived  from  income  tax  return  processing  services,  15%  from 

turnkey  systems,  and  12%  from  software  product  sales.  The 
remaining  1%  of  1988  revenue  was  derived  from  systems 
integration  services. 

CLR  provides  tax  processing  products  and  services  to  over  5,000 
accounting  and  financial  institutions  and  over  1,500  major

FIVE-YEAR  FINANCIAL  SUMMARY 
($  thousands,  except  per  share  data) 


• CLR  management  attributes  revenue  declines  in  1986  to  lower  prices  for 
mainframe  tax  processing  services.  Declines  in  net  income  were  attributable 
to  lower  revenue  and  increased  expenditures  for  the  development  and 
marketing  of  new  products. 

Product  development  expenditures  were  approximately  $16.3  million 
(17%  of  revenue)  in  1986,  compared  to  $14.5  million  (15%  of  revenue) 
in  1985,  and  $12  million  (12%  of  revenue)  in  1984.

• Revenue  for  the  six  months  ending  June  30,  1987  was  $54.2  million,  compared 
to  $54.2  million  for  the  same  period  in  1986.  Net  income  was  $1.9  million, 
compared  to  $3.8  million  for  the  same  period  a year  ago. 

Increased  sales  of  Electronic  Forms  Systems  were  partially  offset  by  a 
decline  in  sales  of  mainframe  tax  processing  services  to  accounting 
firms. 

An  operating  loss  of  $3.6  million  was  incurred  in  the  second  quarter  of 
1987,  compared  to  an  operating  loss  of  $1.9  million  reported  in  1986. 
For  the  six  month  period  ending  June  30,  1987  operating  income 
declined  52%  to  $3.1  million  from  $6.5  million  in  1986.  Declines  were 
the  result  of  higher  expenses  for  sales  and  marketing  of  Electronic 
Forms  Systems  and  tax  processing  services,  increased  cost  of  equip- 
ment sales,  and  additional  expenditures  for  expansion  of  micro- 
computer support  operations. 

NEW  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

• CLR  has  expanded  its  tax  processing  software  products  to  include  Corporate 
Series  Mainframe  Software  for  very  large  corporate  tax  departments. 

In  December  the  company  acquired  Interface/InfoPrep,  a mainframe 
software  package  that  extracts  and  summarizes  mainframe  general 
ledger  data  for  tax  reporting. 

In  late  1986  the  company  acquired  TPS  (Tax  Processing  System),  a 
mainframe  product  that  is  used  to  process  federal  and  state  tax 
returns,  collect  tax  data,  and  calculate,  analyze,  review,  and  print 
workpapers. 

• In  1986  CLR  introduced  a Sales  and  Use  Tax  System  designed  to  compute  the 
sales  tax  and  electronically  print  sales  tax  returns  for  all  state  taxing  jurisdic- 
tions in  the  U.S. 

• CLR  began  offering  data  and  paper  processing  services  to  Master  Limited 
Partnerships  (MLPs)  in  early  1987. 

The  Fast-Tax  MLP  System  offers  complete  ownership  accounting  with 
an  investor  relations  capability  that  enables  MLP  clients  to  keep 
partners  informed  about  their  investment.  The  system  also  provides  a 
year-end  tax  processing  capability  designed  to  accommodate  almost 
any  MLP  partnership  agreement. 

The  Fast-Tax  MLP  System  is  fully  integrated  with  the  company's 
printing  and  distribution  facilities. 

» In  May  1987  CLR  introduced  the  GoSystem  for  in-house  tax  processing  for 
medium  and  large  accounting  firms.  The  product  has  been  under  development 
for  nearly  three  years  and  is  being  tested  in  major  client  locations  around  the 
U.S.  It  is  designed  to  run  on  a standalone  IBM  AT  microcomputer.

• CLR's  revenue  from  its  tax  business  remained  constant  during  1985  and 
reflected  a shift  from  sales  of  mainframe  tax  processing  services  to  sales  of 
microcomputer  tax  workstations  and  related  products  and  services. 

• Decreases  in  net  income  during  1985  were  caused  primarily  by  increased 
expenses  associated  with  product  development  and  marketing  of  electronic 
forms  systems. 

Research  and  development  expenditures  were  approximately  $14.5 
million  (15%  of  revenue)  in  1985,  $12  million  (12%  of  revenue)  in  1984, 
and  $9.9  million  (12%  of  revenue)  in  1983. 

• Revenue  for  the  six  months  ending  June  30,  1986  was  approximately  $54.2 
million,  a 12%  decrease  from  $61.4  million  for  the  same  period  in  1985.  Net 
income  for  the  period  declined  58%  from  $8.9  million  in  1985  to  $3.8  million 
in  1986. 

Revenue  declines  are  attributed  to  more  competitive  market  conditions 
and  the  ongoing  migration  of  tax  processing  from  CLR  mainframes  to 
workstations  located  in  client  offices.  Revenue  from  electronic  forms 
systems  more  than  doubled  in  the  second  quarter  and  first  half. 

Declines  in  income  reflect  decreased  revenue  from  tax  processing  and 
continued  increased  expenditures  associated  with  the  development  and 
marketing  of  electronic  forms  systems. 

• As  of  December  31,  1985,  CLR  had  1,369  permanent  full-time  employees.  In 
addition,  the  company  uses  more  than  500  temporary  employees  in  operations 
and  customer  service  during  its  peak  tax  processing  season  in  March  and  April. 

• Major  competitors  of  CLR  for  tax  processing  services  include  CCH  Computax, 
Inc.  (a  subsidiary  of  Commerce  Clearing  House,  Inc.)  and  Dynatax  (a  division 
of  McDonnell  Douglas  Information  Systems  Group).  The  company  also 
competes  with  regional  and  local  income  tax  processing  firms.  Micro- 
computer software  competitors  include  CPAids,  AMI,  Creative  Solutions,  and 
Volts. 

KEY  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

• INPUT  estimates  approximately  85%  of  CLR's  1985  revenue  was  derived  from 
income  tax  return  processing  services,  10%  from  IBM  PC-based  turnkey 
systems,  and  3%  from  tax  processing  and  electronic  forms  management 
software.  The  remaining  2%  was  derived  from  laser  printer  sales. 

• CLR's  FAST-TAX  division  sells  its  tax  processing  services,  software,  and 
turnkey  products  in  four  primary  markets— Domestic  CPA,  Corporate,  Bank 
Trust,  and  International. 

CLR  provides  its  income  tax  processing  services  under  the  trade  name 
FAST-TAX  to  over  4,600  clients.  The  company  processes  all  types  of

tax  returns,  including  federal  and  state  individual,  corporate,  partner- 
ship, fiduciary,  and  exempt  organization  returns.  Processing  is 
provided  for  nearly  300  federal  and  over  1,500  state  and  city  tax 
forms.  The  FAST-TAX  processing  service  is  presently  available  in 
batch  or  on-line  modes. 

. Mainframe  processing  begins  with  the  Organizer,  a working 

document  on  which  taxpayer  information  is  collected  and 
analyzed  by  the  tax  preparer. 

. Information  recorded  on  the  Organizer  is  used  as  input  to  CLR 

mainframes  either  by  CLR  personnel  or  directly  from  the  tax 
preparer's  office  via  Marathon,  CLR's  nationwide  private 
communications  network.  Access  to  Marathon  is  provided  by  a 
FAST-TAX  Workstation  (described  below)  or  an  on-line  personal 
computer. 

. Via  on-line  access,  tax  preparers  can  examine  and  analyze 

alternative  tax  treatment  options  during  the  preparation 
process.  Answers  to  "what-if"  questions  can  be  displayed  in  the 
preparer's  office  in  various  display  terminals  or  microcomputers. 

. Completed  returns  are  printed  on  blank  paper  using  CLR's  high- 
speed laser  printer  located  either  at  CLR's  data  or  support 
center  or  in  the  preparer's  office.  Returns  printed  at  CLR's 
data  center  are  shipped  to  the  preparer. 

. CLR  currently  retains  taxpayer  data  for  a period  of  one  year 
until  the  subsequent  year's  tax  return  is  processed.  Copies  of 
printed  tax  returns  are  not  retained. 

During  1985  CLR  introduced  Financial  Sense,  a financial  planning 
product  available  to  clients  as  a processing  service. 

. Financial  Sense  allows  CLR  clients  to  offer  short-  and  inter- 
mediate-term financial  plans  to  their  clients  using  much  of  the 
same  data  gathered  from  the  taxpayer's  data  base  developed  in 
the  tax  return  process. 

CLR  markets  and  supports  three  series  of  tax  processing  software 
products  designed  for  IBM  and  compatible  microcomputers.  The 
products  have  standalone  capabilities  and  can  interface  with  client 
mainframes. 

. The  Corporate  Series,  introduced  in  I 985,  is  designed  to  serve 
the  needs  of  large  corporations  that  process  their  tax  returns 
internally.  The  products  process  federal  and  state  tax  returns 
and  automate  administrative  and  planning  tasks  associated  with 
tax  compliance.  The  products  include:

The  CLR  Micro-Tax  Workstation  combines  Micro-Tax  software  with  an 
IBM  XT  or  AT  microcomputer  and  a CLR  Formwriter  2 laser  printer. 

• CLR  also  markets  Electronic  Forms  Systems  which  provide  a complete  forms 
automation  capability  ranging  from  composing,  viewing,  and  managing  to 
printing  and  distributing  electronic  forms. 

Electronic  Forms  Systems  allow  the  user  to  electronically  print  forms 
on  blank  paper.  Electronic  images  of  each  form  are  stored  in  the 
computer  and  displayed  on  various  display  devices  when  and  where 
needed.  The  user  can  enter  information  directly  onto  an  electronic 
image  of  a form,  bypassing  the  need  for  preprinted  paper  forms.  Forms 
can  be  printed  on  high-speed  laser  printers  supported  by  the  system. 

Electronic  Forms  Systems  are  available  for  IBM  mainframes  and  IBM 
and  compatible  microcomputers. 

A central  forms  management  system  is  used  to  create  and  store  more 
than  100,000  electronic  forms  on  a customer's  mainframe.  A distrib- 
uted forms  management  system,  installed  at  remote  sites,  allows  the 
customer  to  store  forms  at  the  central  site  and  control  distribution  of 
forms  to  remote  locations  using  various  display  terminals  and  laser 
printers. 

CLR's  goal  is  to  become  the  leading  supplier  of  forms  automation 
products  not  only  for  tax  processing  applications  but  also  for  other 
businesses  whose  operations  require  a large  volume  and  variety  of 
forms. 

• CLR  also  develops  and  markets  its  Formwriter  Laser  Printing  Systems  which 
are  sold  separately  and  as  a component  of  the  FAST-TAX  or  Micro-Tax 
workstation.  The  Formwriter  can  be  linked  to  a personal  computer  to  become 
a forms  workstation.

Winn  Properties  general  partnership.  In  March  1983  the  partnership  with  Winn 
Properties  was  dissolved  for  state  law  purposes.  In  April  1983  FTNY  was  dis- 
solved and  CRL  assumed  all  of  its  operations. 

Management  attributes  revenue  growth  to  the  greater  volume  of  pro- 
cessed returns  and  higher  revenue  per  return  resulting  from  an  increase 
in  pricing  and  services  rendered  per  return. 

• Research  and  development  costs  reached  $6.7  million  (10%  of  revenue)  in  1982 
as  compared  to  $5.4  million  (10%  of  revenue)  in  1981  and  $3.3  million  (9%  of 
revenue) in  1 980. 

The  company  expects  that  product  development  expenditures  for  1983 
will  increase  by  approximately  50%  over  1982  due  to  continued  funding 
of  several  new  products. 

• Revenue  for  the  six  months  ending  June  30,  1983  reached  $55.1  million,  a 22% 
increase  over  $45.1  million  for  the  same  period  in  1982.  Net  income  for  the 
period  declined  5%,  from  $1  1.7  million  in  1982  to  $1  l.l  million  in  1983. 

The  decrease  in  net  income  was  primarily  due  to  a shift  in  revenue 
previously  derived  in  the  second  quarter  and  now  generated  in  the  third 
quarter  as  the  result  of  an  IRS  ruling  permitting  the  automatic  exten-

addition,  the  company  uses  more  than  700  temporary  employees  in  operations 
and  client  service  during  its  peak  tax  processing  season  in  March  and  April.

Commerce  Clearing  House,  Inc.)  and  Tymshare,  Inc.  (DYNATAX).  The 
company  also  competes  with  smaller  income  tax  processing  firms  preparing 
returns  on  a regional  basis. 

KEY  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

• Ninety-seven  percent  of  CLR's  1982  revenue  was  derived  from  income  tax 
return  processing  services.  The  remaining  3%  was  derived  from  applications 
software  sales,  utility  processing,  contract  printing,  and  various  other  ser- 
vices. 

• CLR  provides  its  income  tax  processing  services  under  the  trade  name  FAST- 
TAX  to  over  4,600  clients.  The  company  processes  all  types  of  tax  returns, 
including  federal  and  state  individual,  corporate,  partnership,  fiduciary, 
deferred  compensation,  and  exempt  organization  returns.  Processing  is 
provided  for  over  220  federal  and  1,100  state  tax  forms. 

• The  FAST-TAX  service  is  presently  available  in  batch  or  on-line  modes. 

In  using  the  batch  service,  the  accounting  firm  has  the  taxpayer  fill  out 

CLR's  Organizer  data  collection  booklet. 

. Information  contained  in  the  Organizer  is  analyzed  and  trans- 
cribed by  the  accounting  firm  onto  a set  of  specially  designed 
input  forms  which  are  sent  to  CLR  for  data  entry  and  tax 
computation. 

. In  advance  of  printing  the  final  tax  return,  the  accounting  firm 
has  the  option  to  request  CLR  to  prepare  checkout  workpapers 
which  replace  accountant  tax  workpapers  and  provide  a 
reconciliation  between  source  data  entered  on  the  Organizer  and 
final  data  entered  on  the  tax  return.

. Clients  can  telephone  tax  return  changes  to  one  of  28  FAST- 
TAX  service  centers  in  the  U.S.  or  to  the  service  center  in  the 
United  Kingdom. 

. After  the  client  is  satisfied  that  the  return  is  complete,  CLR  is 
requested  to  print  the  final  tax  return. 

• The  Organizer  booklet  is  also  completed  by  the  taxpayer  for  the  accounting 
firm  when  using  the  on-line  service.  The  data  transcription  phase  is  auto- 
mated with  Source  1040,  a product  introduced  in  1982. 

. Source  1040  enables  the  tax  accountant  to  enter  the  taxpayer's 
data  from  the  Organizer  into  a computer  terminal  and  transmit 
it  directly  to  CLR  via  Marathon,  CLR's  data  communications 
network. 

. Upon  completion  of  data  entry,  the  tax  accountant  instructs 
CLR  to  calculate  the  tax. 

. Accountants  can  use  CLR's  VIDEO-TAX  application  during  the 
tax  analysis  phase  to  immediately  ascertain  the  impact  of 
various  tax  calculations  for  a particular  return. 

. When  the  return  is  complete,  final  tax  return  data  can  either  be 
printed  on  the  client's  in-house  printer  or  at  CLR  facilities. 

• CLR  provides  clients  with  processing,  computation,  printing,  and  collating  of 
tax  returns  under  a yearly  contract. 

CLR  receives  a non-refundable  registration  fee  of  $250  and  charges 
clients  separately  for  pre-tax  season  services  and  any  other  special 
services  requested. 

The  company  historically  renews  a high  percentage  of  its  contracts. 
Approximately  95%  of  the  clients  for  whom  CLR  processed  10  or  more 
returns  in  1982  renewed  their  contracts  in  1983. 

• In  1981  CLR  introduced  S'Printer®,  a document  processing  software  package 
which  automates  form,  text,  and  business  graphics  composition. 

S'Printer,  originally  developed  to  produce  CLR's  tax  processing  forms, 
runs  on  IBM  and  compatible  mainframes  and  transmits  output  to  FAST- 
TAX  4*15  or  Xerox  9700  laser  printers. 

The  S'Printer  package  includes  print-line  and  text  processing  and  a 
compiler.  Options  include  a font  and  logo  digitization  program,  a 
spelling  checker,  and  a hyphenation  dictionary.

• CLR  has  made  several  new  product  announcements,  as  follows: 

Beginning  in  January  1984  CLR  will  offer  Micro-Line  processing  as  a 
third  mode  of  delivery  for  its  FAST-TAX  clients. 

. Several  software  packages  will  be  available  for  IBM,  Apple,  and 
Tandy  personal  computers  (PC)  to  link  the  client's  PC  to  the 
Marathon  network,  capture  and  transfer  tax  data  to  CLR's 
computers,  and  receive  checkout  workpapers  and  final  tax 
return  data  for  subsequent  printing  at  the  client's  site. 

CLR  is  expanding  and  converting  its  Marathon  communications  network 
to  a new  private  network  design  which  will  be  less  costly,  support  more 
terminals,  and  provide  faster  response  time.  The  new  network,  the 
Marathon  Gateway,  will  support  both  high  speed  and  standard  speed 
access. 

In  April  1983  CLR  announced  the  FAST-TAX  4*15  laser  printer,  de- 
signed to  print  tax  returns  at  a client's  office. 

. FAST-TAX  4*15  includes  S'Printer  software  operating  on  an  IBM 
PC  connected  to  a laser  printer  to  which  the  company  has  added 
hardware  and  software  for  increased  capabilities. 

. This  product,  scheduled  for  client  use  during  the  first  quarter  of 
1984,  will  allow  clients  with  Micro-Line  access  to  FAST-TAX 
services  to  print  finished  collated  tax  returns  in-house  at  a 
speed  of  8 to  10  pages  per  minute. 

INDUSTRY  MARKETS 

• CLR  segments  its  FAST-TAX  business  into  four  primary  markets  as  follows: 

The  domestic  tax  market  includes  all  third-party  preparers  of  tax 
returns  located  in  the  U.S.  Services  provided  to  over  3,600  certified 
public  accounting  firms  accounted  for  approximately  85%  of  CLR's 
1982  revenue. 

The  corporate  tax  market  is  composed  of  public  and  private  corpora- 
tions which  use  internal  tax  departments  to  prepare  tax  returns.  These 
corporations  generally  have  10  or  more  subsidiaries  and  more  than  $50 
million  in  annual  revenue.  Revenue  from  the  CLR's  approximately  670 
corporate  clients  represented  7%  of  1982  revenue. 

The  international  tax  market  consists  of  professional  organizations  that 
prepare  expatriate  returns  for  U.S.  citizens  employed  outside  the  U.S. 
The  company's  160  clients  in  this  market  include  public  accounting 
firms  and  large  corporations  that  prepare  tax  returns  internally  for 
their  expatriate  employees.  Revenue  from  this  market  represented  4% 
of  CLR's  total  1982  revenue.

COMPANY  HIGHLIGHT/COMPUTER  MANAGEMENT  INC. 


This  division  is  actively  seeking  facilities  management  contracts  (no 
revenues  are  now  derived  from  FM)  and  opportunities  to  provide  backup 
and  overflow  services. 

• The  COM  Division  and  its  subdivision  convert  customer  data  from  magnetic 
tape  to  micro-fiche  and  micro-film.  In  addition,  it  distributes  COM  and  COM- 
related  supplies  and  equipment. 

• The  Systems  Division  offers  contract  programming,  systems  design,  and 
consulting. 

CMI  management  considers  its  consulting  expertise  to  be  data  base 
oriented  in  OS  and  DOS  operating  environments  that  may  also  employ 
VS,  IMS,  CICS,  and  DL/I. 

The  emphasis  is  being  shifted  away  from  contract  programming  and 
toward  industry  oriented  applications,  according  to  management. 
Targeted  industries  include  manufacturing  and  distribution. 

The  Division  offers  primarily  consulting  services  to  manufacturers 
although  systems  design  and  contract  programming  are  also  available. 
Applications  specialties  include  manufacturing  requirements  planning, 
materials  management,  production  control,  and  product  distribution 
systems. 

In  addition  to  professional  services,  the  Systems  Division  has  recently 
begun  to  market  software  products. 

. Profits.  It  is  a Point-of-Sale,  order  point,  and  inventorv  control 
software  package  for  auto  parts  retailers.  It  is  offered  as  part 
of  a turnkey  system.  NEAT,  Inc.,  a hardware  integrator, 
provides  the  Data  General  Corporation  NOVA/3  running  under 
IRIS  and  the  maintenance.  Ford  Motor  Credit  offers  end  user 
financing.  The  first  installation  will  be  complete  in  January, 
1979.  During  1979,  CMI  will  expand  the  applications 
software  to  include  wholesale  applications. 

. CMI  is  about  to  offer  an  IMS-based,  on-line  purchasing/receiv- 
ing/accounts payable  system.  At  the  time  of  this  writing,  CMI 
had  an  agreement  in  principal  to  the  exclusive  marketing  rights 
of  such  a product.  The  developer  will  receive  royalties. 

Beginning  in  fiscal  1979,  the  Systems  Division  will  provide  maintenance 
associated  with  software  products  sales. 

• The  Financial  Services  Division  was  formed  during  the  first  quarter  of 
calendar  1978  when  CMI  acquired  marketing  rights  to  four  software  products 
developed  by  the  National  City  Bank  of  Cleveland.  This  Division  now  markets 
these  software  products  to  banks. 

The  four  products  are: 

. CIMS,  Customer  Information  Management  System.  It  is  a 
customer  information  file.

It  is  an  EFT  package. 

. Money  Manager.  It  provides  combined  descriptive  bank  state- 
ments. 

Approximately  18  customers  have  purchased  a total  of  30  licenses  for 
these  products. 

Principal  markets  for  these  software  products  are  banks  with  deposits 
of  between  $200  million  and  $2  billion  and  with  computer  equipment 
running  under  DOS  or  OS  operating  systems. 

Several  bank  customers  offer  these  products  to  correspondent  banks. 
Software  licenses  range  in  price  from  $35,000  to  $90,000  plus  any 
optional  features  selected. 


APPLICATIONS  INPUT  estimates  that  general  business  (accounting)  and  utility

• Revenue  has  declined  each  year  since  fiscal  1980  as  the  level  of  work 
performed  on  a contract  with  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA) 
phased  down  and  was  completed  on  February  28,  1981.  This  contract 
represented  3%,  50%,  and  54%  of  total  revenue  in  fiscal  1982,  1981,  and  1980, 
respectively.  Revenue  from  the  EPA  in  fiscal  1982  is  primarily  the  result  of  a 
$197,000  negotiated  settlement  on  COMNET's  claim  for  fees  on  out-of-scope 
work  performed  under  the  expired  contract. 

• COMNET's  profit  recovery  in  1982  can  be  attributed  to  several  factors: 

Operating  expenses  were  reduced  34%  from  fiscal  1981  primarily  as  a 
result  of  the  elimination  of  equipment  and  other  expenses  no  longer 
necessary  to  support  the  EPA  contract. 

Fiscal  1982  was  not  burdened  with  nonrecurring  charges  amounting  to 
almost  $500,000  in  fiscal  1981. 

COMNET  changed  its  estimate  of  the  useful  lives  and  residual  values  of 
two  computers,  increasing  depreciation  expenses  by  $200,000  per  year. 

Nonoperating  income  in  fiscal  1982  was  enhanced  by  a 60%  increase  in 
interest  income. 

A nonrecurring  fee  earned  on  the  placement  of  equipment  contributed 
over  $400,000. 

• In  fiscal  1981,  COMNET  acquired  223,424  shares  of  U.S.  Design  Corporation 
(USDC)  for  $335,000.  COMNET's  holdings  represented  8%  of  USDC's  out- 
standing shares  as  of  March  31,1  982. 

COMNET  holds  options  for  an  additional  599,637  shares  of  USDC 
stock  at  a price  of  $2.25  per  share,  exercisable  through  July  1986. 
USDC,  founded  in  1978,  manufactures  data  storage  systems. 

COMNET's  fiscal  1982  earnings  were  reduced  by  $100,000  as  a result  of 
its  portion  of  equity  losses  in  USDC.  The  losses  are  due  primarily  to  a 
decision  to  phase  out  production  and  sale  of  the  CSS- 1 I disk  informa- 
tion storage  system,  and  proceed  with  the  development  of  a new 
generation  system,  the  CSS-800. 

• In  July  1981,  COMNET  acquired  the  proprietary  software  products  of  National 
Mailware  Systems,  Inc.  for  $286,000.  The  products  have  been  enhanced  and 
are  now  being  licensed  under  the  name  COM-MAIL. 

• In  February  1982,  COMNET  acquired  375,000  shares,  or  17.4%  of  Zytrex 
Corporation's  common  stock,  for  $300,000. 

Zytrex,  located  in  Sunnyvale  (CA),  designs,  develops,  and  manufactures 
large-scale  memory  and  logic  circuits.

Zytrex,  founded  in  March  1981,  still  in  the  development  stage,  has  not 
yet  generated  revenue. 

• In  July  1982,  the  company  purchased  substantially  all  the  assets  and  customer 
base  of  Data  Systems  Consulting  Corporation  for  $800,000  in  cash  and  226,963 
shares  of  COMNET  common  stock. 

Data  Systems  markets  software  products  for  the  health  care  industry. 

COMNET  plans  to  operate  Data  Systems  as  a separate  division  within 
its  newly  formed  Health  Care  Group,  and  integrate  Data  Systems' 
products  into  its  timesharing  network  by  1983. 

• Government  contracts  contributed  approximately  $9.7  million  of  fiscal  1982 
revenue.  These  will  expire  in  fiscal  1983.  COMNET  is  actively  working  with 
the  respective  agencies  to  extend  these  contracts. 

• COMNET's  major  competitors  are  Boeing  Computer  Services,  Martin  Marietta 
Data  Systems,  and  Optimum  Systems,  Inc.  Other  competitors  include 
Computer  Sciences  Corporation,  Control  Data  Corporation,  GEISCO,  National 
CSS,  Inc.,  Planning  Research  Corporation,  and  Tymshare. 

KEY  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

• The  majority  of  COMNET's  fiscal  1982  revenue  was  derived  from  processing 
services  (50%  remote  computing  and  50%  facilities  management).  The 
remainder  was  derived  from  applications  software  and  professional  services. 

• COMNET  provides  remote  computing  services  to  over  250  customers. 

Three  timesharing  systems  are  available:  WLYBUR,  TSO,  and 

COMNET's  proprietary  software,  ALPHA. 

. ALPHA  permits  "value  added"  use  of  WYLBUR  and  TSO  and 
provides  automatic  file  editing,  remote  job  entry,  and  inter- 
active processing. 

As  a result  of  the  recent  Data  Systems  acquisition,  COMNET  plans  to 
expand  its  network  offerings  over  the  next  year  to  include  applications 
in  the  health  care  field.  These  are: 

. Financial  applications:  billing,  accounts  payable,  accounts 

receivable,  general  ledger,  budgeting,  and  patient  fund  account- 
ing. 

. Special  project  systems:  statistical  analyses,  fixed  assets  ledger, 
nursing  home  based  doctors'  billings,  and  rent  billings  for  sub- 
sidized housing  for  the  elderly.

• Increases  in  revenues  and  earnings  in  FY  1978  were  primarily  the  result  of 
major  long-term  federal  government  contracts  with  the  Environmental 
Protection  Agency  (EPA)  and  the  Department  of  Health,  Education  and 
Welfare  - Office  of  Education  (HEW-OE). 

• COMNET's  decline  in  net  income  in  FY  1980  is  attributed  to  increased 
marketing  activity,  the  acquisition  of  additional  computing  capacity  and  the 
settlement  of  a contract  dispute  with  the  EPA. 

• Revenues  for  the  first  quarter  FY  1981  (ended  June  30,  1980)  decreased  14% 
to  $4.8  million,  as  compared  with  $5.6  million  a year  earlier.  A net  loss  of 
$1  18,000  was  reported  as  opposed  to  net  earnings  of  $290,000  in  FY  1980. 

• In  FY  1979,  the  company  divisionalized  its  operations  for  supervisory  purposes. 
Each  division  is  responsible  for  planning,  program  management  and  computer 
and  communications  operations  for  designated  contracts.  A separate  sales 
division  performs  all  marketing,  sales  and  other  similar  functions. 

The  EPA  division  fulfills  all  facilities  management  requirements  of  the 
EPA  contract  under  one  management  organization. 

The  Federal-Commercial  Systems  division  is  responsible  for  FM  and 
remote  computing  services  provided  to  all  other  clients. 

• The  loss  of  one  or  more  of  COMNET's  major  customers  would  have  an  adverse 
effect  on  the  company's  revenues.  Government  contracts,  which  contributed 
approximately  75%  of  FY  1980  revenues,  will  expire  in  FY  1981.  COMNET  is 
actively  working  to  extend  these  contracts. 

• In  June  1980,  COMNET  signed  an  agreement  with  the  U.S.  Design  Corporation 
(USDC)  providing  for  the  acquisition  by  COMNET  of  up  to  25%  ownership  in 
USDC  and  specified  exclusive  rights  to  market  USDC's  product. 

USDC  offers  a fully  integrated  table-top  computer  system  based  on  a 
DEC  LSI- 1 1/23  microprocessor,  which  can  be  used  in  a timesharing 
environment.  COMNET  believes  that  the  USDC  system  has  potential 
for  DDP  applications,  and  intends  to  incorporate  this  technology  into  its 
network  services. 

• Computer  Network  announced  the  signing  of  a major  FM  contract  with  a 
federal  government  agency  on  July  I,  1980.  COMNET  anticipates  first-year 
revenues  of  over  $1  million  from  the  contract. 

• COMNET's  major  competitors  are  Boeing  Computer  Services,  Martin  Marietta 
Data  Systems  and  Optimum  Systems,  Inc.  Other  primary  competitors  include 
Computer  Sciences  Corporation,  Control  Data  Corporation,  GEISCO,  National 
CSS,  Inc.,  Planning  Research  Corporation  and  Tymshare,  Inc.

ALPHA  has  recently  been  supplemented  with  TSO  and  WYLBUR. 

• FM  contracts  require  the  placement  of  COMNET  personnel  at  the  user  site 
and,  in  some  cases,  dedicated  hardware.  COMNET's  two  FM  contracts  with 
the  EPA  and  HEW-OE  accounted  for  approximately  $17  million  of  FY  1980 
revenues. 

The  EPA  contract  is  valued  at  $40  million  over  four  years.  Awarded  in 
November  1976,  the  contract  expires  in  December  1980.  A dedicated 
facility  using  an  IBM  370/168  is  required. 

COMNET'S  FM  contract  with  HEW-OE,  awarded  in  April  1977,  is  valued 
at  $9  million  over  3 years. 


INDUSTRY  MARKETS 

• Thirteen  departments  and  agencies  of  the  federal  government  accounted  for 
approximately  90%  of  FY  1980  revenues.  Commercial  and  financial  insti- 
tutions accounted  for  the  remaining  10%. 

COMNET  has  experienced  a steady  increase  in  federal  government 
business.  From  an  estimated  41%  of  total  revenues  in  FY  1975, 
government  revenues  now  provide  the  majority.  The  company  does  not 
expect  any  significant  change  in  its  client  base.

nationwide. 

• The  company  claims  to  be  the  fourth  largest 
publicly  traded  payroll  processing  and  tax 
filing  company  in  the  U.S. 

• Since  its  initial  public  offering  in  January

acquisitions  directed  at  increasing  the 
company’s  presence  in  the  payroll 


processing  and  information  services 
markets. 

• During  1995,  COSI  acquired  MCC

INPUT  Vendor  Profile 


Organization  and  Structure 

During  fiscal  1995,  COSI  continued  the 
ongoing  process  of  consolidating  all  of  its 
operations  into  two  divisions. 

• The  payroll  companies  are  being 
standardized  onto  one  processing  system 
and  the  outsourcing  companies’  computer 
operations  are  in  the  process  of  being 
consolidated. 

• Until  the  integration  of  all  the  operations  is 
completed,  the  company  will  continue  to 
experience  higher  costs  due  to  the 
conversion  efforts  and  duplication  of 
facilities  and  personnel. 

• These  activities  negatively  impacted 
profitability  in  fiscal  1995. 

COSI  currently  operates  through  two  units  as 
follows: 

• The  PayUSA  division  provides  payroll 
processing  and  associated  services  through 
the  following  subsidiaries: 

- Daton-PayUSA,  Inc.,  based  in  Santa  Ana 
(CA),  services  Southern  California. 

- Key-ACA,  Inc.,  based  in  Westwood  (MA), 
services  the  New  England  area. 

- NEDS,  Inc.,  based  in  Cranston  (RI),  also 
services  the  New  England  area. 

- PayUSA  of  NJ,  Inc.,  based  in  New  York, 
services  Greater  New  York. 

• COSI’s  outsourcing  business  is  conducted 
through  the  following  units: 

- The  PCS  Data  Processing  division,  based 
in  New  York,  provides  processing  to  the 
book  publishing  industry. 


- MCC  Corporation,  based  in  Murray  Hill 
(NJ),  is  a wholly  owned  subsidiary 
providing  outsourcing  services  to  the 
transportation,  banking,  and  publishing 
industries. 

- Tru-Check  Computer  Systems,  Inc.,  based 
in  New  York,  is  a wholly  owned  subsidiary 
that  provides  sales  data  collection  and 
reporting  services  to  consumer  goods 
manufacturers. 

- The  ESM  division,  based  in  New  York, 
provides  payroll  services  to  home  health 
care  companies. 

Company  Strategy 

COSI’s  strategy  is  to  provide  a comprehensive 
computer  outsourcing  alternative  for  all  or 
part  of  its  clients’  data  processing 
requirements. 

COSI’s  strategy  includes  the  following 
elements: 

• COSI  management  believes  that  payroll 
processing  services  represent  the  area  with 
the  highest  potential  for  future  growth. 

• COSI  stresses  close  attention  to  customer 
service  and  support.  As  a result,  the 
company’s  client  relationships  tend  to  be 
long-term  with  very  low  turnover, 
generating  recurring  and  predictable 
revenue.  COSI  has  approximately  27%  of 
its  entire  staff  dedicated  to  customer 
support  and  sales. 

• COSI  attempts  to  maximize  the  use  of  its 
products  and  services  by  offering  a range  of 
services  to  each  client.  Products  are 
designed  to  work  either  on  a standalone, 
modular  basis  or  as  fully  integrated 
systems.  Clients  can  expand  their  use  of 
COSI  services  by  adding  modules  as  needs 
dictate.  In  addition,  clients  can  increase  or

decrease  the  volume  of  services  provided  by 
adjusting  the  number  of  on-line  terminals 
installed  in  their  offices. 

COSI  intends  to  standardize  its  entire  payroll 
processing  system  to  the  client/server-based 
system  acquired  in  June  1994  with  Daton 
Data  Processing  Services,  Inc. 

• COSI  expects  to  complete  Rhode  Island 
conversions  during  calendar  1996  and  make 
significant  progress  in  Boston  and  New 
York. 


For  fiscal  1996,  COSI  intends  to  enlarge  its 
market  share  in  the  payroll  processing  and 
specialty  segments  of  the  outsourcing 
industry,  primarily  through  internal  growth. 

Financials 

COSI’s  fiscal  1995  revenue  reached  nearly 
$22.2  million,  a 40%  increase  over  fiscal  1994 
revenue  of  $15.9  million.  Net  losses  were 
approximately  $0.6  million,  compared  to  net 
income  of  $0.5  million  for  fiscal  1994.

Revenue  increases  during  fiscal  1995  were 
due  primarily  to  acquisitions  in  the  prior  and 
current  fiscal  years. 

• Tru-Check,  acquired  in  January  1994, 
contributed  $117,000  to  the  increase. 

• Daton,  acquired  in  June  1994,  contributed 
$1.8  million  to  the  increase. 


• Certain  acquired  payroll  operations  from 
Delta  Management  Systems,  Inc.  in  August 
1994  contributed  $284,000  to  the  increase. 

• Key-ACA,  acquired  in  May  1995, 
contributed  $1.2  million  to  the  increase. 

MCC,  acquired  in  June  1995,  contributed  $3.4

These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  a 
decrease  of  $188,000  in  payroll  processing 
revenue  from  NEDS,  Inc.  and  decreases  of 
$419,000  from  infomercial,  apparel  and  other 
outsourcing  revenue. 

As  previously  discussed,  COSI’s  profitability 
was  negatively  impacted  during  fiscal  1995  by 
the  ongoing  process  of  consolidating  the 
operations  of  acquired  companies  and 
standardizing  the  entire  payroll  processing 
business  to  client/server  technology. 

Revenue  Analysis  by  Product /Service 
INPUT  estimates  that  approximately  62%  of 
COSI’s  fiscal  1995  revenue  was  derived  from 
processing  services  and  38%  from  outsourcing 
services.  COSI’s  fiscal  1995  revenue  was 
segmented  as  follows: 


Processing  Services 

- Payroll  processing 32% 

- Sales  data  collection 

and  reporting 9%

38% 

Interim  Results 

Revenue  for  the  three  months  ending  January 
31.  1996  reached  $7.1  million,  a 62%  increase 
over  $4.4  million  for  the  same  pei'iod  in  1995.

custom-configured  computer  terminals, 
printers  and  communication  equipment  in  its 
clients’  offices.  These  on-line  systems  are 
linked  by  leased  digital  or  analog  data

initial  training  at  the  client’s  business 
location  and  user  manuals.  To  maintain

needs. 

Support  is  available  at  the  customer  site,  or 
by  telephone  during  business  hours  for 
system-related  questions  and  general  problem 
solving.  Because  many  clients’  terminals  are 
on-line  with  COSI  computers,  support 
personnel  are  able  to  communicate  directly 
with  them  to  diagnose  errors,  solve  problems 
from  software  and  hardware  and  make 
software  upgrades  at  any  time.

appointments  and  make  sales  calls.  Initial 
contact  is  made  by  a variety  of  methods, 
including  mailings,  telemarketing,  and 
attendance  at  industry  conventions  and  trade 
shows.

Total  revenues  for  fiscal  year  end

THE  COMPANY 

• Computer  Professionals  Unlimited  Inc.  (CPU)  was  incorporated  in  Michigan 
during  1969. 

CPU's  founders  spun  off  from  the  National  Bank  of  Detroit  to  form 
CPU. 

The  consulting  firm  was  then  hired  by  the  Credit  Union  League  in 
Michigan  to  perform  consulting  services.  This  led  to  CPU  offering 
facilities  management  (FM)  services  to  credit  unions  under  the  auspices 
of  the  Credit  Union  League.  In  early  1977  CPU  acquired  the  marketing 
rights  from  the  Credit  Union  League  and  now  offers  services  to  credit 
unions  independently  of  the  League. 

About  four  years  ago  CPU  also  began  providing  batch  and  remote 
computing  processing  services  to  credit  unions.  Most  of  the  firm's 
growth  outside  Michigan  occurred  during  this  period. 

• Revenues  for  fiscal  1979  are  expected  to  reach  $5  million,  a 52%  increase  over 
fiscal  1978  revenues  of  $3.3  million. 

Management  anticipates  that  most  of  the  company's  future  growth  will 
be  through  CPU's  new  line  of  turnkey  systems  offered  through  CPU 
Computing  Company.  CPU  Computing  is  a newly  formed  wholly  owned 
subsidiary  of  CPU. 

The  subsidiary  is  expected  to  generate  $1.1  million  in  revenues  during 
fiscal  1979.  The  rest  of  CPU  is  expected  to  generate  $3.9  million  in 
revenues  for  fiscal  1979. 

Fiscal  1 978  pretax  income  for  the  company  was  approximately  $200,000 
and  net  income  about  $1  15,000. 

Management  states  that  earnings  have  consistently  been  reinvested. 

• Employees  are  distributed  as  follows:

marketing  persons  and  the  customer

O 


• During  1977,  CPU  and  Intercontinental  Computing  Corp.  (Shawnee  Mission, 
KS)  announced  acquisition  negotiations.  Although  the  acquisition  efforts  were 
subsequently  terminated,  management  claims  that  CPU  is  continuing  to 
actively  search  for  acquisition  candidates. 


KEY  PRODUCTS  AND  SERVICES 

• CPU  provides  management  information  services  to  400  credit  unions  serving  a 
total  of  1.2  million  member  accounts.  Computer  services  for  fiscal  1978  were 
generated  as  follows:

100% 

• One  hundred  percent  of  fiscal  1978  processing  revenues  were  generated  by 
remote  computing  services,  split  evenly  between  remote  batch  (50%)  and 
interactive  remote  computing  (50%). 

CPU  provides  credit  union  branch  offices  with  audio  response/inquiry 
services  as  part  of  its  remote  batch  services. 

Credit  unions  located  a mile  or  so  from  CPU  may  on  occasion  elect  to 
hand  carry  input  or  output,  thus  processing  data  in  batch  mode.  This 
accounts  for  a negligible  portion  of  revenues. 

• Processing  services  provide  a wide  range  of  specialized  applications  to  credit 
unions.  The  more  than  100  reports  include: 

Membership  information  file  access 

Certificates  of  deposit 

Investments 

Quarterly  statements 

Monthly  statements 

Dividends 

Share  accounts 

Loan  accounts

CPU  provides  three  principal  processing  services.  Variations  of  these  have 
been  available  since  1961.

package  directed  at  credit  unions  with  assets  between  $100,000  and 
$500,000. 

Daily  remote  batch  processing  generates  about  50%  of  revenues  and  is 
targeted  at  credit  unions  with  assets  of  $500,000  to  $3,000,000.  It 
includes  audio  response  to  inquiries  about  share  account  balances  and 
memo  posting. 

. For  audio  response,  the  computer  selects  from  a series  of  pre- 
recorded syllables.  Audio  response  acts  as  a backup  system  when 
the  on-line,  real-time  system  goes  down. 

Memo  posting  enables  immediate  recording  of  withdrawals  made 
from  member  accounts. 

Interactive  remote  computing  services,  about  40%  of  revenues,  are 
targeted  at  credit  unions  with  assets  between  $5,000,000  and 
$50,000,000.  This  segment  of  CPU's  business  grew  rapidly  during  fiscal 

1978.  Currently,  I 15  credit  unions  use  this  service. 

Professional  services  consist  mostly  of  occasional  contract  programming  for 
user  credit  unions. 

Other  products  and  services  provided  by  CPU  support  processing  services  and 
consist,  for  example,  of  the  sale  or  lease  of  data  capture  cassette  devices  and 
microfiche  viewers. 

Beginning  in  fiscal  1978,  CPU  has  been  offering  turnkey  systems. 

They  are  targeted  at  credit  unions  with  assets  between  $10,000,000  and 
$50,000,000. 

CPU  purchases  minicomputers  and  operating  systems  from  GEAC  (a 
Canadian  company).  It  has  exclusive  rights  to  market  GEAC  8000  minis 
to  credit  unions  in  the  U.S.  It  then  modifies  the  operating  system  and 
adds  specialized  credit  union  software. 

CPU  customizes  the  applications  software  added  to  the  GEAC  8000 
minicomputers  more  than  it  customizes  its  processing  services 
software.  It  also  provides  maintenance. 

The  first  turnkey  system  was  installed  during  August,  1978. 

. A total  of  five  installations  are  expected  by  the  end  of  fiscal 

1979. 

. An  additional  12  to  15  installations  are  anticipated  for  fiscal 

1980. 

Another  20  to  25  turnkey  systems  sales  are  projected  for  fiscal 

1981. 

Management  plans  to  develop  a smaller  turnkey  system,  to  be  priced  at 
about  60%  of  the  cost  of  the  existing  system,  to  credit  unions  with 
assets  under  $ 1 0,000,000.
