BASELINE  TENSILE  TESTING  AT  THE  WIRE  ROPE  LABORATORY 

By  William  M.  McKewan1  and  Anthony  J.  Miscoe2 


ABSTRACT 

The  U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines  has  established  a  wire  rope  research  laboratory  to  examine  the  factors 
that  affect  the  life  of  wire  rope.  Ropes  of  sizes  ranging  from  3/4  to  2  in.  in  diameter  and  from  2  to  35  ft 
in  length  were  tested  to  determine  their  breaking  strength,  elongation,  and  torque.  This  was  done  to 
characterize  the  test  equipment  on  ropes  used  in  mine  hoisting  systems.

INTRODUCTION 


The  U.S.  Bureau  of  Mines  hoisting  systems  develop- 
ment project  is  an  effort  to  improve  the  safety  and 
efficiency  of  mine  hoisting  systems.  A  major  part  of  this 
effort  involves  the  study  of  the  degradation  of  wire  rope 
during  its  service  life.  Some  500  hoists  are  used  in  the 
United  States,  and  in  most  of  them,  the  cages  for 
personnel  and  the  skips  for  product  are  raised  and  lowered 
by  a  single  wire  rope.  Cages  may  hold  as  many  as 
100  people,  and  shafts  are  as  deep  as  7,000  ft. 

Skips  have  fallen  in  this  country,  with  accidents  to 
nearby  personnel  and  damage  to  the  hoisting  system.  The 
accidents  resulting  from  retrieving  the  rope,  repairing,  and 
putting  the  shaft  back  into  service  are  significant.  No 
cages  have  fallen  in  the  United  States,  but  the  probability 
of  such  occurrences  will  escalate  in  the  future  because 
mining  deeper  reserves  will  require  longer  ropes  and 
higher  hoisting  speeds.  Lower  safety  factors  will  be  used 
since  regulations  state  that  the  safety  factor  can  be  reduced 
from  7  to  4  as  shaft  depth  increases  from  0  to  4,000  ft  and 
more.  The  fact  that  cages  have  fallen  in  foreign  countries 
confirms  that  this  research  is  not  only  desirable  but 
necessary. 

While  the  technology  of  fabricating  wire  ropes  has 
achieved  a  high  degree  of  sophistication,  the  quantitative 
understanding  of  the  degradation  of  the  rope  during 
service  is  at  a  very  low  level.  A  wire  rope  is  really  a 
mechanical  system  having  a  very  complex  geometry.  It  is 
actually  a  multilayer  spring  with  internal  damping.  When 
a  loaded  wire  rope  is  bent  around  a  sheave  to  change  its 
direction,  the  mechanics  become  even  more  complicated 
since  transverse  forces  are  introduced.  In  addition  to  the 
internal  wear  caused  by  the  wires  sliding  on  each  other, 
external  wear  is  caused  by  rubbing  and  sliding  in  the 
sheave.  Adding  to  the  problem  are  the  dynamics  of  ropes 
up  to  a  mile  long  and  ropes  traveling  at  speeds  up  to 
2,850  ft/min,  accelerating  and  decelerating  with  attached 
loads  on  imperfectly  aligned  guides.  Also  to  be  considered 
are  the  mine  shaft  environmental  conditions  of  abrasive 
dirt  and  acid  or  alkaline  moisture.  Consequently,  mine- 
hoist  ropes  endure  great  punishment.     Analysis  of  the 


effects  of  these  factors  on  the  deterioration  of  a  wire  rope 
therefore  requires  an  extensive  research  program  and  data 
generation  with  high  precision. 

The  Wire  Rope  Research  Laboratory  (WRRL)  was  es- 
tablished by  the  Bureau  to  examine  the  factors  that  affect 
wire  rope  strength,  and  ultimately,  its  useful  life.  At 
present,  hoist  ropes  in  mines  are  inspected  both  visually 
and  by  nondestructive  sensors.  A  judgment  is  made,  based 
on  the  observations  and  experience  of  the  observer,  as 
to  whether  the  rope  meets  the  retirement  criteria  of  the 
U.S.  Mine  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (MSHA)  (if 
and  should  be  retired  from  service.  At  some  mines,  ropes 
are  retired  after  a  certain  period  of  time  has  occurred  or 
a  given  amount  of  tonnage  has  been  lifted.  The  purpose 
of  the  WRRL  is  to  provide  accurate  data  to  determine  the 
effects  of  variables  on  the  reduction  of  the  strength  of  wire 
rope  during  its  service  life  so  that  judgment  becomes  less 
of  a  factor. 

The  best  way  to  measure  the  deterioration  of  strength 
in  a  wire  rope  is  to  measure  its  ultimate  or  breaking 
strength,  but  this  obviously  cannot  be  done  while  the  rope 
is  in  service.  At  the  WRRL,  ropes  will  be  deteriorated  by 
a  bending  fatigue  machine  of  unique  design,  containing 
three  sheaves  that  will  exercise  a  1,000-ft  length  of  rope  to 
produce  nine  different  levels  of  fatigue  at  a  predetermined 
tensile  load  and  travel  speed.  Visual  inspection  and  non- 
destructive testing  (NDT)  profiles  will  be  made  periodi- 
cally as  the  rope  is  cycled.  After  some  time,  broken  wires 
and  other  indications  of  wear  will  determine  that  the  rope 
be  removed.  Sections  of  special  interest  will  be  cut  out, 
then  further  subdivided  for  detailed  examination.  The  ex- 
amination will  consist  of  four  analyses  (in  addition  to  the 
NDT  profile):  wire-by- wire  examination  for  correlation 
with  the  NDT  profiles,  single-wire  torsion  tests,  metallo- 
graphic  examination,  and  tensile  strength  measurements. 

The  primary  objectives  of  the  baseline  testing  program 
covered  in  this  report  were  to  determine  (1)  the  operating 
characteristics  of  the  tensile  machine,  (2)  the  precision  of 
data  produced  by  the  tensile  machine,  and  (3)  the  proper- 
ties of  the  wire  rope  samples  used  during  tensile  testing. 


EQUIPMENT  DESCRIPTION 


Although  the  tensile  machine  was  designed  primarily 
for  tensile  strength  tests  on  wire  rope  specimens  in  support 
of  bending  fatigue  research,  it  also  has  the  versatility  to 
test  fatigue  under  cyclic  axial  force.  The  main  application 
of  this  tensile  machine  will  be  to  measure  breaking 
strengths,  elongations,  and  torques  of  new  ropes  for 
comparison  with  measurements  made  after  the  ropes  have 
been  degraded  on  the  bending  fatigue  machine.  These 
measurements  will  provide  quantitative  data  to  establish 


the  effects  of  service  conditions  on  the  life  of  wire  ropes. 
New  and  used  ropes  from  mine  hoists,  obtained  through 
cooperative  agreements  with  mining  companies,  will  also 
be  tested  to  assess  the  effects  of  real-life  use.  The  ma- 
chine is  shown  in  figure  1.  System  specifications  are  listed 
in  table  1.

The  machine  is  essentially  a  hydraulically  actuated  ten- 
sile testing  machine  in  a  horizontal  position  rather  than 
the  usual  vertical  position  to  reduce  vertical  height  re- 
quirements and  for  ease  of  access.  It  is  composed  of  three 
elements  operating  in  conjunction:  the  load  frame,  the 
electrical  console,  and  hydraulic  power  supply.  The  load 
frame  contains  the  hvdraulic  crosshead  locks.  The  locks 


sustain  full  rated  load  in  either  direction  with  zero  slippage 
and  zero  backlash.  Safety  containers  for  the  specimen  are 
provided  for  operator  protection  during  testing. 

Functionally,  the  test  machine  is  a  closed-loop  servohy- 
draulic  system  in  which  high-pressure  hydraulic  fluid  under 
the  precise  control  of  a  servovalve  is  provided  to  the  hy- 
draulic actuator,  which  applies  the  load  to  the  specimen. 
To  accomplish  this,  the  system  controller  accepts  externally 
generated  electrical  control  and  feedback  signals  from  the 
transducer.  These  signals  are  compared  to  detect  any 
error,  and  the  resulting  signal  is  used  to  control  the  servo- 
valve.  Several  operating  variables  can  be  selected  as  con- 
trol parameters  by  choosing  the  appropriate  transducer 
for  the  feedback  signal.  The  controllable  parameters  are 
displacement  of  the  actuator,  load  applied  to  the  specimen, 
and  torque  generated  by  the  wire  rope  specimen  as  an  ax- 
ial load  is  applied. 


The  electronic  control  console  contains  all  the  necessary 
components  for  servocontrol,  hydraulic  power  control,  sig- 
nal conditioning,  test  parameter  readout,  and  interlock 
functions.  It  also  contains  a  digital  computer  and  the  nec- 
essary interfaces  to  record,  manipulate,  and  plot  the  testing 
data. 

The  factors  examined  in  the  baseline  series  were 

1.  The  precision  of  the  data  generated  by  the  system 
for  ultimate  strength,  elongation,  and  torque. 


2.  The  effectiveness  of  resin  sockets  to  withstand  rope 
ultimate-strength  loads  and  comparison  of  resin  sockets 
with  zinc  (spelter)  sockets. 

3.  The  effect  of  actuator  speed  on  generated  data. 

4.  The  effect  of  sample  length  on  generated  data. 

5.  Variation  of  generated  data  along  the  length  on  a 
single  reel  of  rope. 


EXPERIMENTAL  DESIGN 


There  are  a  number  of  factors  that  can  be  determined 
during  the  tensile  testing  of  wire  rope.  Some  are  measured 
directly,  such  as  breaking  load,  and  some  are  calculated, 
such  as  modulus  of  elasticity.  Before  a  test  is  conducted, 
certain  physical  measurements  are  made  on  the  rope. 
These  are  (1)  gauge  length,  the  rope  length  between  the 
sockets,  (2)  rope  diameter,  and  (3)  lay  length.  From  the 
diameter  and  the  rope  construction,  the  metallic  area  can 
be  calculated. 

During  the  course  of  the  program  the  operational  char- 
acteristics of  the  machine  were  determined.  The  measure- 
ments made  during  testing  were  (1)  the  displacement  of 
the  actuator  rod,  or  the  stroke,  (2)  the  load  applied  to  the 
specimen,  and  (3)  the  torque  generated  by  the  specimen  as 
an  axial  load  is  applied.  The  sensors  for  these  measure- 
ments were  calibrated  by  the  machine  manufacturer. 

Bureau  researchers  wanted  to  gain  as  much  information 
as  possible  from  the  testing,  both  about  the  tensile 
machine  and  about  the  different  samples  of  rope.  It  was 
known  in  advance  that  the  manufacturer's  catalog  does 


not  provide  any  detailed  information  about  a  rope. 
Manufacturers  are  required  only  to  meet  a  minimum 
strength,  nothing  else;  they  are  not  required  to  give  data 
on  the  actual  breaking  strength,  the  elongation,  the 
chemical  composition,  or  the  microscopic  structure  of  the 
rope.  Therefore,  the  experimental  work  was  designed  to 
gain  maximum  data  from  as  few  tests  as  possible. 

Originally,  10  tests  were  scheduled  for  each  rope  series. 
The  characteristics  of  the  ropes  chosen  for  each  series  are 
shown  in  table  2.  Samples  were  cut  to  the  following 
lengths:  5,  10,  15,  20,  and  35  ft.  Two  samples  were  taken 
of  each.  The  10  samples  were  cut  from  the  reel  in  random 
order.  From  a  procedure  of  this  nature,  the  precision  of 
the  testing  could  be  calculated.  In  addition,  the  effects  of 
sample  size  on  the  results  and  the  uniformity  of  the  rope 
on  the  reel  could  be  determined.  Later,  it  was  decided  to 
add  2-ft  samples  to  the  test  program  to  increase  the  range 
of  the  data  and  to  substitute  30-ft  samples  for  the  35-ft 
samples  to  allow  for  the  larger  elongations.

EXPERIMENTAL  PROCEDURE 


Enough  rope  was  cut  to  allow  for  the  amount  that 
would  be  in  the  sockets.  The  ends  were  seized,  broomed, 
and  cleaned.  The  brooms  were  cleaned  in  a  vented  tank 
of  trichloroethane  and  then  washed  with  steam  and 
detergent  to  remove  any  residual  matter.  The  brooms 
were  then  closed,  inserted  into  the  sockets  and  set  in  an 
epoxy  resin.  With  this  procedure,  there  was  no  problem 
with  the  brooms  pulling  out  of  the  sockets.  After  curing 
for  about  an  hour,  the  samples  were  ready  for  testing. 
One  series  of  samples  was  made  commercially  with  zinc- 
filled  sockets,  using  rope  from  a  reel  that  had  been 
previously  tested,  to  compare  the  results  obtained  with  zinc 
and  epoxy  sockets. 

The  samples  were  placed  in  the  tensile  machine,  and 
the  testing  was  begun.  Initially  a  prestretch  load  of  about 
5  to  10  kips  was  placed  on  the  rope,  and  the  stroke  was  set 
at  zero.  This  procedure  led  to  an  S-shaped  curve  during 
the  elastic  portion  of  the  test,  because  of  the  construction 
stretch  that  exists  in  new  rope.  During  the  second  series 
of  samples,  a  prestretch  load  equal  to  20  pet  of  the 
breaking  strength  was  placed  on  the  sample  for  10  min  or 
until  the  rope  stopped  elongating.  This  load  was  then 
removed,  and  the  test  was  conducted  as  before.  This  pro- 
cedure eliminated  construction  stretch  and  the  S-shaped 
curves.  The  20-pct  prestretch  load  was  used  for  all  of  the 
remaining  tests.  Construction  stretch  and  the  S-curves  are 
discussed  later  in  this  report. 

The  following  measurements  were  made  during  the 
testing  as  a  function  of  time:    (1)  load  in  kips,  (2)  stroke 


in  inches,  (3)  torque  in  kip-inches.  From  these  measure- 
ments the  other  factors  can  be  calculated,  such  as  stress, 
strain,  and  elongation. 

The  "Wire  Rope  Users  Manual"  (2)  gives  certain  speci- 
fications for  determining  breaking  strengths  of  wire  ropes: 

The  breaking  strength  is  the  ultimate  load 
registered  on  a  wire  rope  sample  during  a  tension 
test....  All  discussion  of  strength  is  predicated  on 
the  assumption  of  there  being  a  gradually  applied 
load  that  will  not  exceed  one  inch  per  minute....  A 
minimum  acceptance  strength,  2-1/2%  lower  than 
the  published  nominal  breaking  strengths,  was 
established  as  the  industry  tolerance....  The  sample's 
length  must  not  be  less  than  3  ft  (0.91  m)  between 
sockets  for  ropes  with  diameters  of  from  1/8  inch 
(3.2  mm)  through  3  inches  (77  mm);  on  ropes  with 
larger  (over  3  inches)  diameters,  the  clear  length 
must  be  a  least  20  times  the  rope  diameter.  The  test 
is  considered  valid  only  if  failure  occurs  2  inches 
(51  mm)  or  more  from  either  of  the  sockets,  or  from 
the  holding  mechanism. 

The  "Wire  Rope  Users  Manual"  specifications  were  fol- 
lowed for  most  of  the  testing.  The  exceptions  were  (1)  a 
few  2-ft  samples  were  tested  to  aid  in  the  determination 
of  modulus  of  elasticity,  and  (2)  a  series  of  tests  were  run 
over  a  range  of  stroke  rates  to  determine  the  effect  of  this 
variable. 


EXPERIMENTAL  RESULTS 


TYPICAL  RESULTS 

There  were  eight  series  of  rope  samples  run  during 
the  baseline  testing.  Of  these  samples,  only  the  80  samples 
that  broke  more  than  the  standard  two  in  from  the  sockets 
were  used  for  the  determination  of  breaking  strength. 
However,  samples  that  broke  near  the  sockets  could  be 
used  for  calculation  of  modulus  of  elasticity  and  yield 
because  these  data  are  accumulated  prior  to  the  breaking 
point  and  are  independent  of  behavior  in  the  plastic  region 
near  the  breaking  point. 

The  data  from  two  tests  are  shown  in  tables  3  and  4. 
The  stroke  in  inches  is  shown  to  be  a  function  of  time  in 
seconds  since  the  stroke  was  set  at  1  in/min.  This  can  be 
seen  easily  by  comparing  the  stroke  data  with  the  time  at 
60-s  intervals.  The  load  in  kips  and  the  torque  in  kip- 
inches  were  measured  by  the  machine  at  the  designated 
time  intervals.     The  torque  in  pound  (force)  feet  was 


calculated  from  the  torque  in  kip-inches.  The  elongation 
in  inches  was  determined  from  the  stroke,  using  a  com- 
pliance factor  determined  by  the  machine  configuration 
and  the  socket  diameter.  This  factor  multiplied  by  the 
load  is  subtracted  from  the  stroke  to  give  the  elongation. 
The  compliance  factor  takes  care  of  any  tension  or 
compression  in  the  machine  parts,  the  grips,  and  the 
sockets.  This  is  a  significant  correction  as  can  be  seen  by 
comparing  stroke  with  elongation.  The  stress  in  kips  per 
square  inch  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  load  by  the  rope 
metallic  area.  The  strain  in  percent  inch  per  inch  is 
calculated  by  dividing  the  elongation  by  the  rope  gauge 
length  in  inches  and  multiplying  by  100. 

From  the  data  in  tables  3  and  4,  the  curves  in  fig- 
ures 2  and  3,  respectively,  were  plotted.  From  every  run 
made  during  the  baseline  testing,  a  table  was  generated 
and  three  curves  were  plotted.

From  the  plots  of  load  versus  elongation  on  fig- 
ures 24  and  3/4  and  the  data  from  the  tables,  the  breaking 
strength  and  the  breaking  elongation  can  be  determined. 
The  breaking  strength  is  defined  as  the  maximum  load  that 
the  rope  attains.  The  breaking  elongation  is  defined  as  the 
maximum  elongation  that  the  rope  attains,  which  occurs 
when  the  rope  breaks.  The  maximum  load  does  not  nec- 
essarily occur  at  the  maximum  elongation,  as  is  shown  in 
table  3. 

Figures  25  and  35  show  plots  of  stress  versus  strain. 
The  elastic  region  is  the  initial  straight-line  portion  of  the 
plot  where  stress  is  proportional  to  strain.  The  plastic 
region  is  the  final  part  of  the  plot  where  the  stress  is  no 
longer  proportional  to  strain.  The  slope  of  the  straight- 
line  portion  of  a  stress-strain  curve  is  defined  as  the 


modulus  of  elasticity.  It  is  equal  to  the  stress  divided  by 
the  strain  and  is  in  units  of  pounds  per  square  inch. 
Because  the  stress-strain  plots  for  many  metals  and  for 
wire  rope  do  not  show  a  well-defined  transition  from 
elastic  to  plastic  behavior,  it  is  customary  to  define  the 
yield  stress  by  drawing  a  line  parallel  to  the  slope  of  the 
stress-strain  plot  and  displaced  0.2  pet  of  the  gauge  length 
to  the  right.  This  line  will  intersect  the  curve  in  the  plastic 
region.  This  point  of  intersection  is  defined  as  the  yield 
stress.  The  strain  at  that  point  is  the  yield  strain. 

Figures  2C  and  3C  show  plots  of  torque  versus  load. 
As  can  be  seen  from  the  figures,  torque  is  proportional  to 
load  almost  to  fracture.  The  slope  of  the  torque-versus- 
load  plot  is  called  the  Torque  K.  It  has  the  units  of  pound 
(force)  feet  per  kip.

SUMMARY  OF  NORMAL  BREAKS 

A  normal  break  is  defined  as  a  break  that  occurs  2  in 
or  more  from  the  socket.  Only  data  obtained  with  normal 
breaks  were  accepted  for  the  measurement  of  breaking 
strength.  The  summaries  of  data  for  the  eight  series  of 
rope  tests  are  shown  in  tables  5  to  12.  Also  shown  in  the 
summary  tables  are  the  means,  the  standard  deviations, 
and  the  percentage  that  the  standard  deviations  are  of  the 
means.    In  table  13  the  means,  standard  deviations,  and 


the  percent  standard  deviations  of  all  of  the  ropes  are 
shown  for  the  breaking  strength  (load),  the  modulus  of 
elasticity,  the  breaking  stress,  the  yield  stress,  and  the 
torque  constant.  It  is  apparent  from  examining  the 
percent  standard  deviation  columns  that  the  precision  is 
good  for  the  measurement  of  load  and  torque.  It  is  also 
apparent  that  any  measurement  involving  elongation,  such 
as  modulus  of  elasticity,  has  poor  precision,  considering  all 
of  the  data  from  a  series.  The  measurement  of  stroke, 
elongation,  and  modulus  of  elasticity  are  discussed  later.

CONSTRUCTION  STRETCH 

Wire  rope  stretches  under  load.  This  stretch  comes 
from  two  sources,  elastic  and  constructional.  The  elastic 
stretch  is  reversible,  and  the  rope  recovers  to  its  original 
length  when  the  load  is  removed.  The  construction  stretch 
is  not  reversible.  Construction  stretch  occurs  in  new  rope 


and  happens  when  a  load  is  first  applied.  The  wires  and 
strands  are  first  seated,  then  act  in  a  constricting  manner 
to  compress  the  core  permanently.  Construction  stretch  is 
more  pronounced  in  fiber-core  ropes  than  in  wire-rope- 
core  or  strand-core  ropes. 

When  a  tensile  test  is  made  on  a  rope,  and  the  con- 
struction stretch  has  not  been  removed,  it  adds  to  the 


13 


elongation  on  the  rope  during  the  initial  loading.  This  will 
give  an  S-shaped  stress-strain  curve,  with  sometimes  only 
a  small  central  linear  portion.  An  example  is  shown  in 
figure  44.  All  of  the  rope  A  series  and  part  of  the  rope 
B  series  were  run  in  this  manner,  resulting  in  S-shaped 
curves. 

During  the  rope  B  series,  it  was  decided  to  attempt  to 
remove  the  construction  stretch  prior  to  the  test.  It  was 
observed  from  examining  the  stress-strain  curves  that  the 
linear  portion  began  after  the  rope  was  loaded  to  about 
20  pet  of  the  breaking  strength.  Consequently,  the  ropes 
were  loaded  to  20  pet  of  the  breaking  strength  and  held 
for  10  min  or  until  they  stopped  stretching.  Then  the  load 
was  removed,  and  the  test  was  made  under  normal  pro- 
cedures. The  results  are  shown  in  figure  4B. 

This  stress-strain  plot  does  not  have  an  S-curve  and  is 
linear  from  the  beginning.    For  comparison,  the  curves

from  figures  44  and  4B  are  plotted  together  in  figure  5. 
All  subsequent  tests  were  made  following  this  procedure 
for  removing  construction  stretch.  None  of  the  following 
tests  showed  the  S  curves. 


BREAKING  LOAD  VERSUS  GAUGE  LENGTH 

Breaking  load  was  plotted  against  gauge  length  to 
determine  the  effect  of  sample  length  on  breaking  load 
(fig.  6).  The  plots  show  a  definite  effect  of  length  on 
breaking  strength.  The  shorter  samples  have  higher  break- 
ing strengths  than  the  longer  samples.  There  seems  to  be 
little  effect  on  samples  of  15  ft  and  longer.  However,  the 
2-ft  samples  have  much  higher  strength.  Even  the  5-  and 
10-ft  samples  show  higher  strength.  This  is  true  for  the 
3/4-in-diameter  samples  as  well  as  the  2-in-diameter 
samples.  The  reason  for  this  phenomenon  is  not  known. 
However,  it  can  be  hypothesized  that  shorter  ropes  with 
rigidly  attached  sockets  form  a  more  rigid  structure  in  the 
test  machine,  thus  exhibiting  higher  "system  strength." 

BREAKING  LOAD  VERSUS  REEL  POSITION 

The  samples  were  cut  from  the  reel  in  a  random  order 
to  determine  whether  any  variations  in  properties  existed 
along  the  length  of  the  rope.  When  the  variables  were 
plotted  against  reel  position,  there  was  no  correlation 
shown  between  any  factor  and  the  position  on  the  reel. 
The  most  important  variable  in  this  respect  is  the  breaking 
strength.  Figure  7  shows  two  plots  of  breaking  strength 
against  reel  position,  for  ropes  B  and  D.  As  can  be  seen, 
there  is  no  correlation.  The  results  are  the  same  for  the 
other  samples.

EFFECTS  OF  STROKE  RATE  ON  RESULTS 

The  "Wire  Rope  Users  Manual"  states  that  for  a 
strength  test  to  be  valid  there  must  be  a  "gradually  applied 
load  that  will  not  exceed  a  stroke  rate  of  1  in/min."  All  of 
the  baseline  tests  to  determine  physical  factors  were  run 
at  a  stroke  rate  of  1  in/min  regardless  of  the  size  of  the 
sample. 

It  was  desired  to  see  if  strain  rate  had  any  effect  on 
the  results.  At  a  stroke  rate  of  1  in/min,  it  is  obvious  that 
the  strain  rate  of  a  2-ft  sample  will  be  15  times  the  strain 
rate  of  a  30-ft  sample.  For  a  2-ft  sample  to  have  the  same 
strain  rate  as  a  30-ft  sample  at  a  stroke  rate  of  1  in/min, 
the  stroke  rate  for  the  2-ft  sample  would  have  to  be 
1/15  in/min.  For  a  30-ft  sample  to  have  the  same  strain 
rate  as  a  2-ft  sample  at  a  stroke  rate  of  1  in/min,  the 
stroke  rate  for  the  30-ft  sample  would  have  to  be 
15  in/min.  To  determine  the  effects  of  varying  strain  rates 
on  the  samples,  a  series  of  samples  with  zinc  sockets  were 
made  up,  all  of  15  ft  in  length.  The  stroke  rates  tested 
were  0.0625, 0.125, 1, 8,  and  16  in/min.  These  stroke  rates 
cover  the  variations  in  strain  rate  discussed  above.  The 
results  are  shown  in  table  11  and  in  figure  8.  Figure  &4 
shows  that  the  breaking  elongation  is  lessened  as  the 
stroke  rate  is  increased.  Figure  85  shows  that  the  modulus 
of  elasticity  is  increased  slightly  as  the  stroke  rate  is 
increased.  This,  of  course,  correlates  with  the  decreased 
elongation  as  the  stroke  rate  is  increased.  As  can  be  seen 
in  figure  8C,  there  is  no  effect  on  breaking  strength  from 
the  variation  in  stroke  rate  over  the  ranges  shown.  The 
correlation  coefficient  for  breaking  strength  versus  stroke 
rate  has  the  value  of  0.279,  which  indicates  no  correlation 
for  this  relationship.

EFFECT  OF  GAUGE  LENGTH  ON 
MODULUS  OF  ELASTICITY 

When  the  data  tables  (tables  5-12)  are  examined,  it 
becomes  apparent  that  the  columns  involving  strain 
measurements  have  high  errors  compared  with  the  col- 
umns involving  load  or  torque  measurements.  The  modu- 
lus of  elasticity,  the  breaking  strain,  and  the  yield  strain  all 
show  these  high  errors.  And  yet,  when  samples  of  the 
same  length  are  compared,  the  values  are  shown  to  be 
close  to  each  other.  Plots  of  modulus  of  elasticity, 
breaking  strain,  and  yield  strain  against  gauge  length  all 
show  correlation,  although  not  necessarily  linear  correla- 
tion. Figure  9  shows  plots  of  modulus  of  elasticity  versus 
gauge  length  for  the  various  test  ropes.  These  plots  show

that  the  modulus  of  elasticity  is  lowest  for  the  2-ft  samples 
and  highest  for  the  30-  and  35-ft  samples,  initially  in- 
creasing rapidly  in  value  with  gauge  length,  then  leveling 
off  at  the  higher  gauge  lengths. 

The  tensile  machine  does  not  measure  gauge  length 
directly.  During  the  initial  calibration  of  the  machine,  very 
precise  measurements  were  made  of  the  elongation  and 
compression  of  the  machine  components  over  the  full 
range  of  load  capability.  These  components  included  the 
columns,  heads,  grips,  pins,  and  sockets.  The  deflection 
data  are  contained  in  the  data  logging  program.  The  pro- 
gram subtracts  from  the  movement  of  the  actuator  the 
appropriate  deflection  at  the  sensed  load  for  all  of  the 
involved  components.  The  different  grips  and  sockets  for 
each  rope  size  are  included  individually  in  the  program. 
After  pretest  stretching,  the  load  is  removed,  the  gauge 
length  is  measured  manually,  and  the  actuator  position  is 
set  to  zero.  Consequently,  a  very  accurate  and  repro- 
ducible measurement  is  made  of  the  change  in  distance 
between  the  socket  ends  during  a  run,  which  is  nominally 
the  gauge  length  for  a  solid  sample.  In  the  case  of  a 
socketed  wire  rope,  the  wire  is  not  fastened  rigidly  to  the 
socket  end.  The  rope  is  broomed  and  cast  with  epoxy  or 
zinc  in  the  cone  of  the  socket.  Thus,  the  compressibility 
of  the  material  in  the  socket  becomes  a  variable. 

If  an  assumption  is  made  that  the  broomed  end  of  the 
rope  can  stretch  and  move  to  some  degree  out  of  the 
socket,  then  an  explanation  can  be  made  for  the  high 
errors  of  the  elongation  measurements.  There  is  some 
physical  justification  for  this  assumption.  Markers  placed 
on  the  socket  ends  with  a  pointer  on  the  rope  showed 
some  movement  of  the  rope  end  out  of  the  socket  when  a 
load  was  applied.  The  rope  end  moved  back  into  the 
socket  when  the  load  was  removed.  Further,  the  epoxy 
resin  has  a  very  low  modulus  of  compression.  Zinc  has  a 
higher  modulus  of  compression,  but  it  is  still  much  lower 
than  that  of  the  high-carbon  steel  of  which  the  wires  are 
made. 

Consider  the  following.  The  broomed  end  in  each 
socket  moves  out  of  the  socket  by  an  amount  proportional 
to  the  load.  Because  the  tensile  machine  measures  the 
distance  between  the  socket  ends,  it  determines  the  sum  of 
the  lengths  that  each  broom  pulls  out  plus  the  elongation 
of  the  original  length  of  rope  measured  between  the 
sockets  (the  gauge  length).  The  amounts  that  the 
broomed  ends  move  out  are  independent  of  the  gauge 
length  of  the  sample.  Consequently,  the  percentage  error 
becomes  less  as  the  gauge  length  increases. 

It  is  possible  to  calculate  this  error  if  elongation  at  a 
constant  load  is  plotted  against  gauge  length  for  different 
sample  lengths.  For  a  solid  rod,  elongation  would  be 
directly  proportional  to  gauge  length  within  the  elastic 
range.  For  a  wire  rope,  elongation  should  still  be  directly 
proportional  to  gauge  length,  but  with  an  intercept  on  the 
y-axis  (elongation).  The  intercept  represents  the  error 
caused  by  the  broom  pullout.  This  error  is  directly 
proportional  to  load  while  within  the  elastic  region  of  the 
stress-strain  plot. 


The  values  for  elongation  at  a  constant  load  cannot  be 
taken  directly  from  the  data  tables.  If  the  B  plots  in  fig- 
ures 2  and  3  are  examined,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  slopes 
for  the  stress-strain  curves  do  not  go  through  the  origin  of 
the  coordinates,  because  of  the  preload  put  on  the  sample 
and  the  subsequent  zeroing  of  the  stroke.  This  can  be  al- 
lowed for  by  taking  the  slope  of  each  stress-strain  plot  and 
mathematically  forcing  it  through  the  origin.  The  slope  of 
the  stress-strain  curve  is  the  modulus  of  elasticity  and  is 
given  in  column  2  of  the  data  tables  (tables  5-11). 

Then, 


modulus  =  stress/strain, 

strain  =  stress/modulus, 

strain  =  elongation/gauge, 

and     elongation  =  strain  x  gauge.

(2) 
(3) 
(4) 


Thus,  it  is  possible  to  calculate  elongation  at  a  given 
strain,  knowing  the  modulus  of  elasticity.  These  calcu- 
lations are  shown  for  a  given  stress  of  100,000  psi  in 
tables  14-20.  The  given  stress  of  100,000  psi  is  approxi- 
mately at  the  midpoint  of  the  elastic  region  of  the  stress- 
strain  plot.  As  is  demonstrated  in  the  tables,  strain  is 
calculated  from  the  modulus  and  the  given  stress  using 
equation  2.  Then,  elongation  is  calculated  from  the  strain 
and  gauge  using  equation  4.

lodulus  of  elasticity  = 

=  0.1/(9.68819E-03 

+  0.142489/X). 

Plots  of  elongation  versus  gauge  for  the  test  ropes  are 
shown  in  figure  10.  As  predicted,  elongation  is  a  linear 
function  of  gauge  length  with  an  intercept  off  the  origin. 
The  intercept  is  the  sum  of  the  amounts  of  the  pullout  of 
each  broomed  end  at  a  stress  of  100,000  psi.    In  plot  A, 


which  shows  a  plot  for  the  rope  A  series  samples,  the 
equation  of  the  slope  is  given  as 

Y  =  9.68819E-03  *  X  +  0.142489,  (5) 

where  Y    =  elongation,  in, 

and  X    =  gauge  length,  in. 

If  the  elongation  (Y)  is  divided  by  the  gauge  length  (X), 
the  strain  (S)  is  calculated  as  per  equation  3. 
Equation  5  becomes 


where 


S  =  9.68819E-03  +  0.142489/X,  (6) 

S    =  strain,  in/in. 


If  the  stress  is  divided  by  the  strain  (S),  the  modulus 
of  elasticity  (Mod)  is  calculated  as  per  equation  1.  Equa- 
tion 6  becomes 

Mod  =  100,000/(9.68819E-03  +  0.142489/X),     (7) 

where     Mod    =  modulus  of  elasticity,  psi. 

If  equation  7  is  divided  by  1,000,000,  the  modulus  of 
elasticity  is  converted  from  pounds  per  square  inch  to  mil- 
lion pounds  per  square  inch.   Equation  7  then  becomes 


Mod  =  0.1/(9.68819E-03  +  0.142489/X). 


(8) 


Plots  of  modulus  of  elasticity  in  million  pounds  per 
square  inch  versus  gauge  length  in  inches  are  given  in  fig- 
ure 9  for  all  of  the  baseline  test  series.  Also  shown  in  the 
plots  are  the  equations  for  the  modulus  of  elasticity  devel- 
oped as  in  equation  8.  The  curves  shown  were  not  deter- 
mined by  curve  fitting.  These  curves  are  derived  from  the 
elongation  data  for  each  series  of  tests  and  calculated  as 
shown  above  in  equations  5  through  8. 

The  linearity  of  the  elongation-versus-gauge-length  plots 
and  the  positive  intercepts  prove  the  hypothesis  that  there 
is  a  constant  error  in  elongation  measurement  that  is  pro- 
portional to  load  and  independent  of  gauge  length.  r.rhe  fit 
of  the  data  points  to  the  calculated  equations  for  modulus 
of  elasticity  on  figure  9  is  further  proof  of  the  hypothesis. 

The  modulus  of  elasticity  for  rope  A  can  be  calculated 
using  equation  8  and  the  gauge  length  data  shown  in  ta- 
ble 14.  The  calculated  values  can  be  compared  with  the 
experimental  values.  The  standard  deviation  for  regression 
of  the  experimental  data  about  the  calculated  curve  is 
shown  at  the  bottom  of  column  5  of  table  14.  This  is 
much  lower  than  the  standard  deviation  for  the  experi- 
mental data  (column  2),  without  considering  the  effects  of 
gauge  length.  The  same  is  true  for  the  other  series  (tables 
15-20). 

One  way  to  determine  strain  accurately  would  be  to 
mechanically  mount  an  elongation  measuring  device  such 
as  the  one  developed  by  Versuchsgrube  Tremonia  (3). 
This  procedure  is  generally  undesirable  because  it  would

be  necessary  to  stop  the  test  before  yield  is  reached,  re- 
move the  load,  open  the  protection  boxes,  dismount  the 
device,  close  the  boxes,  then  reload.  All  these  steps  would 
be  time  consuming  and  could  affect  the  later  test  results. 
Other  possibilities  would  be  to  develop  a  precise  optical 
ranging  system  or  a  system  with  disposable  components. 
The  elongation  corrections  at  a  stress  of  100,000  psi  are 
shown  in  table  21  for  all  of  the  rope  series  tested.  Also 
shown  in  the  table  are  the  rope  diameters,  the  rope  cross- 
sectional  metallic  areas,  and  the  loads  on  the  ropes  at 
100,000  psi  stress.  In  figure  11,  the  elongation  correction 
in  inches  is  plotted  against  the  load  in  kips.  The  load  in 
kips  was  calculated  from  the  rope  metallic  area  and  the 
stress  of  100,000  psi.  The  plot  shows  that  the  elongation 
correction  is  essentially  constant  for  the  ropes  from  1-1/4- 
to  2-in  diameter.  Further,  a  straight  line  covers  the  ropes 
from  3/4-  to  1-1/4-in  diameter.  However,  considerably 
more  work  would  have  to  be  done  before  any  real 
correlation  could  be  proven.  It  appears  likely  that  the 
elongation  correction  for  each  rope  diameter  and  con- 
struction would  have  to  be  done  by  testing.  The  elonga- 
tion correction  factor  could  then  be  placed  in  the  com- 
puter program,  and  the  effects  of  varying  gauge  length 
would  be  eliminated.

COMPARISON  OF  ZINC  AND  EPOXY  SOCKETING 

The  modulus  of  elasticity  for  epoxy  is  approximately 
500,000  psi,  while  that  for  zinc  is  about  12,000,000  psi. 
The  question  was  whether  zinc-socketed  ropes  would  be- 
have differently  than  epoxy-resin-socketed  ropes.  It  must 
be  remembered  that  the  material  in  the  socket  is  not  epoxy 
or  zinc  alone  but  a  composite  of  high-carbon  steel  wires 
plus  a  zinc  or  an  epoxy  fdler. 

A  set  of  10  ropes  was  made  with  zinc-socketed  ends. 
The  lengths  were  2,  5,  10,  20,  and  30  ft,  with  two  samples 
each.  The  rope  used  for  the  tests  was  the  same  1-1/2-in- 
diameter  rope  that  was  used  for  the  rope  B  series  so  that 
the  results  could  be  compared  directly.  The  data  for  the 
zinc  series  are  shown  in  table  12.  These  data  can  be 
compared  with  the  rope  B  series  shown  in  table  6.  The 
results  are  remarkably  similar.  The  breaking  strength  ver- 
sus gauge  length  is  shown  in  figure  12.  The  plot  shows  no

tions in  tables  6  and  12.  A  plot  of  elongation  versus  gauge 
length  for  both  series  is  also  shown  in  figure  12.  Neither 
the  correction  factors  nor  the  slopes  in  the  plots  of 
elongation  versus  gauge  length  are  statistically  different. 
Finally,  plots  of  modulus  versus  gauge  length  for  both  zinc 
and  epoxy  resin  are  shown  in  figure  13.  Again,  the  data 
points  and  the  independently  determined  equations  for  the 
modulus  as  a  function  of  gauge  length  are  very  close  to 
each  other.  The  conclusion  is  that  there  is  no  significant 
difference  in  the  behavior  of  the  zinc  and  the  epoxy  resin 
socketed  ropes  for  breaking  strength  tests.  Both  the  zinc 
sockets  and  the  epoxy  resin  sockets  developed  100  pet  of 
the  normal  breaking  strength  of  the  ropes.  During  the 
testing  for  all  of  the  rope  series,  the  resin-socketed 
terminations  developed  100  pet  of  the  normal  breaking 
strength  of  the  ropes. 

The  U.S.  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (7)  states  that 
for  wire  rope  load  end  attachments 

(a)  Wire  rope  shall  be  attached  to  the  load  by  a 
method  that  develops  at  least  80  pet  of  the  nominal 
strength  of  the  rope. 

(b)  Except  for  terminations  where  use  of  other 
materials  is  a  design  feature,  zinc  (spelter)  shall  be 
used  for  socketing  wire  ropes. 

The  wording  in  the  regulations  is  identical  for  metal  and 
nonmetal  open  pit  mines;  sand,  gravel,  and  crushed  stone 
operations;  metal  and  nonmetal  underground  mines; 
underground  coal  mines;  surface  coal  mines;  and  surface 
work  areas  of  underground  coal  mines. 

In  Great  Britain,  the  Safety  in  Mines  Research  Es- 
tablishment,  after   extensive   testing,   found   that   resin 


sockets  were  as  strong  as  the  rope  and  has  accepted  them 
for  use  in  mining  (4).  The  findings  in  this  report  agree, 
which  suggests  that  the  CFR  could  be  amended  to  allow 
the  use  of  resin  for  the  socketing  of  mine  ropes. 

TORQUE  CALCULATIONS 

The  torque  on  the  rope  is  measured  directly  by  the  ten- 
sile machine  sensor  as  a  function  of  time  and  is  reported 
in  kip-inches.  This  value  is  changed  to  pound  (force)  feet 
and  reported  in  the  data  tables.  Examples  are  shown  in 
tables  2  and  3.  Plots  of  torque  in  pound  (force)  feet  ver- 
sus load  in  kips  are  shown  in  plot  C  of  figures  2  and  3. 
The  plots  show  the  data  to  be  linear  well  into  the  plastic 
region  of  the  rope.  The  slope  of  the  plot  is  called  the 
Torque  K,  and  has  the  units  pound  (force)  feet  per  kip. 
If  the  Torque  K  is  known  for  a  rope,  it  is  possible  to 
calculate  the  torque  on  the  rope  for  virtually  any  load. 
The  Torque  K's  for  all  of  the  rope  series  are  shown  in 
tables  5  through  12.  A  summary  of  the  mean  values  and 
the  standard  deviations  is  shown  in  table  13. 

A  general  equation  for  determining  the  approximate 
torque  in  ropes  under  load  was  developed  by  Gibson  (5). 
This  equation  was  developed  for  six-strand  ropes  with  fiber 
cores.  He  found  that  the  torque  was  directly  proportional 
to  the  load  and  the  square  of  the  rope  diameter  and 
indirectly  proportional  to  the  lay  length.  His  equation  is 
given  as 


T  =  A(D2)S/L, 
where      T    =  torque,  Ibf-in, 

D    =  rope  diameter,  in, 
S    =  load,  lb,

and         A    =  0.91  for  Lang  lay  and  0.55  for  regular  lay 
ropes. 

The  constant  A  used  by  Gibson  in  equation  9  can  be 
calculated  from  the  experimental  data  in  table  12,  using 
the  following  equation: 


A  =  12KL/1,000D2, 
where      K    =  Torque  K,  lbf-ft/kip.

The  results  of  the  calculations  of  the  constant  A  are 
shown  in  table  22.  Two  additional  ropes  are  shown  in  this 
table,  Y  and  R,  which  refer  to  used  mine  hoist  ropes. 
They  were  added  for  comparison  purposes.  The  values  for 
Gibson's  constant  A  indicate  that  Gibson's  approximations 
are  very  close  to  the  experimental  data  as  determined  on 
the  tensile  machine.

SUMMARY 


The  operating  characteristics  of  the  tensile  machine 
have  been  learned  using  a  variety  of  rope  samples.  The 
machine  has  been  determined  to  have  high  precision  in  the 
measurements  of  load,  stroke,  and  torque. 

All  of  the  rope  samples  tested  were  shown  to  have 
uniform  properties  along  the  length  of  the  reel.  The 
stroke  rate  had  no  effect  on  either  the  breaking  strength 
of  the  ropes  or  on  the  torque  developed  as  the  load 
increased.  However,  there  was  slight  lessening  of  the 
breaking  elongation  at  the  higher  stroke  rates.  There  was 


no  difference  in  the  properties  of  the  ropes  when  either 
zinc  or  epoxy  resin  was  used  as  socketing  material.  The 
elongation  of  the  ropes  calculated  from  the  stroke  mea- 
surements was  shown  to  vary  with  the  length  of  the  sam- 
ples. This  variation  was  caused  by  an  unaccounted-for 
extrusion  of  the  socketing  material.  This  extrusion  can  be 
corrected  in  the  computer  program,  but  a  series  of  tests 
would  have  to  be  run  to  determine  the  additional  cor- 
rection factor  for  each  rope  size  and  construction.
