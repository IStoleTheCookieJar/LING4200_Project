New animation shows Victoria's international trade 


The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has produced an exciting new way to see Victoria's 
international merchandise trade. 


The Trade Pyramid is an animated graphic illustrating the change over time (from 1988-89 to 
2008-09) in Victoria's exports and imports, among the state's top ten (in dollar terms) trading 
partners by broadly grouped commodities. 

The following link will take you to the Trade Pyramid on the ABS website: 
https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Victorian+Trade+Pyramid 


Once you are on the Victorian Trade Pyramid page, select a commodity of interest from the drop 
down menu and click the play button to the right of the pyramid to see the animation. 


Further information is available in State and Regional Indicators, Victoria, December 2010 (cat. 
no. 1367.2).
