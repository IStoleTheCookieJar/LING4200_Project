Total  fresh  citrus  production  is  forecast  at  a  record  level  of  68. 1  million  metric  tons  in  1996/97.  The  amount 
of  citrus  processed  in  selected  countries  is  also  forecast  to  set  a  record  level  at  28.9  million  metric  tons.  Fresh 
citrus  exports  have  remained  relatively  stable  over  the  last  10  years.  The  amount  of  fresh  citrus  processed  in 
1996/97  accounts  for  42  percent  of  selected  country  citrus  production.  In  contrast,  the  growth  in  the  amount 
of  fresh  citrus  processed  in  selected  countries  (up  46  percent)  has  exceeded  the  increase  in  fresh  citrus 
production  (up  35  percent)  over  the  last  10  years,  due  to  expanding  world  demand  for  juice  products.  The 
sharper  expansion  in  processing  reflects  expanded  orange  production  in  Brazil,  where  output  is  dominated  by 
international  demand  for  frozen  concentrate  orange  juice,  and  in  the  United  States  where  orange  production 
has  more  than  recovered  from  freezes  in  Florida  in  the  1980s.  During  the  1980s  and  1990s,  the  shift  in 
consumer  patterns  toward  more  health-conscious  products,  including  both  fresh  citrus  and  fruit  juices, 
consumer  preferences  for  convenience  foods,  and  rising  incomes  have  contributed  to  the  expansion  in  both 
citrus  production  and  processing.  Income  distribution  further  influenced  the  variety  and  form  of  juice 
consumed.  For  example,  in  developed  countries  citrus  consumption  is  mainly  in  the  form  of  products  while 
in  developing  countries  more  citrus  is  consumed  fresh.

EXPORT  NEWS  AND  OPPORTUNITIES 

GSM-102  Program:  USDA  increases  operational 
credit  guarantees  to  Egypt,  Indonesia  and  Russia 

Since  the  last  publication,  the  United  States 
Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA)  has  increased 
by  $50  million  the  amount  of  operational  credit 
guarantees  available  to  U.S.  exporters  for  sales 
of  previously  announced  U.S.  agricultural 
commodities  to  Egypt  for  fiscal  year  1997.  This 
action  completes  the  allocation  of  the  entire 
$200  million  in  program  coverage  authorized  for 
sales  to  Egypt  in  fiscal  year  1997.  All  other 
terms  and  conditions  previously  announced 
remain  the  same. 

On  May  28,  USDA  increased  by  $100  million  the 
amount  of  credit  guarantees  available  to  U.S. 
exporters  for  sales  of  U.S.  agricultural 
commodities  to  Indonesia  under  the  GSM-102 
program  for  fiscal  year  1997.  This  action 
increases  the  fiscal  year  1997  allocation  for 
Indonesia  from  $160  million  to  $260  million.  All 
other  terms  and  conditions  previously  announced 
remain  the  same. 

On  June  10,  USDA  increased  by  $25  million  the 
allocation  of  credit  guarantees  for  sales  of  U.S. 
agricultural  commodities  to  Russia  under  the 
GSM-102  program  for  fiscal  year  1997.  This 
action  increases  the  total  fiscal  year  1997 
allocation  for  sales  to  Russia  from  $95  million  to 
$120  million.  All  other  terms  and  conditions 
previously  announced  remain  the  same. 

The  GSM-102  program  makes  available  financing 
for  the  sales  of  U.S.  agricultural  commodities 
overseas.  USDA  does  not  provide  financing,  but 
guarantees  payments  due  from  foreign  banks. 
USDA  typically  guarantees  98  percent  of  the 
principal  and  a  portion  of  the  interest.  The  GSM- 
102  program  covers  credit  terms  from  90  days  to 
three  years.  Under  the  program,  once  a  firm  sale 
exists,  the  qualified  U.S.  exporter  applies  for  a 
payment  guarantee  before  the  date  of  export. 
The  U.S.  exporter  pays  a  fee  calculated  on  the 
dollar  amount  guaranteed,  based  on  a  schedule 
of  rates  applicable  to  different  lengths  of  credit 
periods.  The  CCC-approved  foreign  bank  issues 


a  dollar-denominated,  irrevocable  letter  of  credit 
in  favor  of  the  U.S.  exporter,  ordinarily  advised  or 
confirmed  by  the  financial  institution  in  the 
United  States  agreeing  to  extend  credit  to  the 
foreign  bank.  The  U.S.  exporter  may  negotiate 
an  arrangement  to  be  paid  as  exports  occur  by 
assigning  the  U.S.  financial  institution  the  right  to 
proceeds  that  may  become  payable  under  the 
guarantee,  and  later  presenting  required 
documents  to  that  financial  institution.  Such 
documents  normally  include  a  copy  of  the  export 
report.  If  a  foreign  bank  fails  to  make  any 
payment  as  agreed,  the  exporter  or  the  assignee 
may  file  a  claim  with  USDA  for  the  amounts  due 
and  covered  by  the  guarantee.  USDA  will  pay 
the  U.S.  bank  and  will  take  on  the  responsibility 
of  collecting  the  overdue  amount  from  the 
foreign  bank. 

The  tables  on  pages  9  and  10  present  FY  1997 
allocations  by  country  and  product  along  with 
registrations  through  June  6,  1997,  for  various 
horticultural  commodities  and  products. 
Repayment  terms  vary  under  the  program,  from 
90  days  to  3  years.  Cautionary  information  for 
use  of  the  accompanying  table:  The  table  reflects 
only  exporter  applications  for  guarantees  that 
have  been  entered  into  the  GSM  102 
computerized  system.  At  any  given  time, 
exporter  applications  are  in  process,  and  not  all 
of  those  received  have  been  entered  into  the 
system.  Moreover,  all  applications  are  initially 
entered  into  the  system  on  a  provisional  basis 
until  price  reviews  have  been  completed,  the 
guarantee  fee  has  been  received,  and  the  written 
guarantee  has  been  issued.  Thus,  some 
applications  now  in  the  system  may  in  the  future 
be  removed,  and  the  commodity  balances 
correspondingly  increased.  For  details  on  terms 
and  authorizations,  see  the  footnotes  to  the 
table. 

Note:  The  GSM  will  consider  requests  to 
establish  a  GSM-102  program  for  a  country  or 
region  or  amend  an  authorized  program  to  include 
horticultural  commodities  and  products  which  are 
currently  not  eligible.  (For  further  information  on 
the  GSM-102  program  for  horticultural 
commodities,  contact  Yvette  Wedderburn 
Bomersheim,  202-720-9903).

Supplier  Credit  Guarantee  Program:  no  activity 
since  last  publication 

The  SCGP  is  unique  because  it  covers  short-term 
financing  extended  directly  by  U.S.  exporters  to 
foreign  buyers  and  requires  that  the  importers 
sign  a  promissory  note  in  case  of  default  on  the 
CCC-backed  payment  guarantee.  The  SCGP 
emphasizes  high-value  and  value-added  products, 
but  may  include  commodities  or  products  that 
also  have  been  programmed  under  the  GSM-102 
program. 

The  tables  on  pages  1 1  and  1 2  present  FY  1 997 
allocations  by  country  and  product  along  with 
registrations  through  June  6,  1997,  for  various 
horticultural  commodities  and  products. 
Cautionary  information  for  use  of  the 
accompanying  table:  The  table  reflects  only 
exporter  applications  for  guarantees  that  have 
been  entered  into  the  SCGP  computerized 
system.  At  any  given  time,  exporter  applications 
are  in  process,  and  not  all  of  those  received  have 
been  entered  into  the  system.  Moreover,  all 
applications  are  initially  entered  into  the  system 
on  a  provisional  basis  until  price  reviews  have 
been  completed,  the  guarantee  fee  has  been 
received,  and  the  written  guarantee  has  been 
issued.  Thus,  some  applications  now  in  the 
system  may  in  the  future  be  removed,  and  the 
commodity  balances  correspondingly  increased. 

Note:  The  GSM  will  consider  requests  to 
establish  a  SCGP  for  a  country  or  region  or 
amend  an  authorized  program  to  include 
horticultural  commodities  and  products  which  are 
currently  not  eligible.  (For  further  information  on 
the  SCGP  for  horticultural  commodities,  contact

EXPORT  NEWS  AND  OPPORTUNITIES 

First  direct  shipment  of  U.S.  sweet 
cherries  arrives  in  China 

The  first  official  shipment  of  sweet  cherries  from 
Washington  state  arrived  in  Shanghai  on  June 
19.  This  first-time  shipment  follows  the  recent 
signing  of  a  modified  work  plan  governing  export 
shipments  of  Washington  state  cherries.  The 
previous  work  plan  had  effectively  precluded 
shipments  by  requiring  that  the  entire  program  be 
suspended  in  the  event  of  a  Western  cherry  fruit 
fly  detection  in  a  shipment.  Under  the  revised 
work  plan,  such  a  detection  will  require  that  the 
lot  of  cherries  be  either  fumigated,  reexported  or 
destroyed,  but  just  the  packing  facility  from 
which  the  cherries  originated  would  be 
suspended  from  the  program  until  an 
investigation  and  corrective  measures  could  be 
undertaken. 

The  Northwest  Cherry  Growers,  representing 
2,500  sweet  cherry  growers  from  Washington 
state,  estimates  the  initial  Chinese  market  could 
be  worth  $2  to  $4  million  annually,  with 
long-term  potential  even  higher.  The  U.S.  cherry 
industry  will  likely  now  turn  its  attention  to 
addressing  China's  trade  restrictive  import  duty, 
currently  set  at  48  percent  ad  valorem,  plus  a  1  7 
percent  VAT.  The  ongoing  WTO  accession 
process  provides  an  opportunity  for  bringing  this 
duty,  and  others,  down  to  trade  facilitating 
levels.  Efforts  to  expand  the  cherry  agreement  to 
include  other  production  areas,  notably  California, 
Oregon,  and  Idaho,  are  ongoing. 


WORLD  TRADE  SITUATION  AND 

POLICY  UPDATES 

EU'S  1997/98  program  in  compliance 
with  U.S.  -  EC  Canned  Fruit  Accord 

FAS  has  determined  that  the  European  Union's 
proposed  canned  fruit  program  for  1997/98 
complies  with  the  U.S. -EC  Canned  Fruit  Accord 
(CFA).  The  net  cost  of  canning  peaches  to  EU 
processors,  after  processing  aid  payments  from 

July  1997  13 


Brussels  are  deducted  from  the  minimum  price 
paid  to  growers  for  raw  fruit,  is  estimated  at 
$203.57,  above  the  agreed-upon  world  price  of 
$199.84  per  metric  ton.  For  canned  pears, 
processing  aids  were  reduced  by  25  percent  due 
to  the  EU  having  exceeded  its  production 
threshold  during  the  last  3  years.  The  penalty 
brings  the  1  997/98  net  cost  to  processors  up  to 
$268.25  per  metric  ton  of  canning  pears,  versus 
a  calculated  world  price  of  $189.06. 

The  CFA  is  a  long  standing  bilateral  agreement 
between  the  US  and  the  EU  to  review  and  agree 
upon  a  representative  world  price  for  fresh 
peaches  and  pears  used  for  canning.  The  CFA 
also  sets  out  procedures  to  ensure  that  the  EU 
processing  aid  is  contained  to  a  level  that  keeps 
the  net  cost  of  canning  fruit  for  EU  processors  at 
or  above  the  world  price  level.  In  recent  years, 
the  U.S.  share  of  world  canned  peach  markets 
has  continued  to  decline,  due  to  factors  beyond 
the  scope  of  the  CFA,  including  the  lucrative 
withdrawal  program  which  has  boosted  EU  peach 
production  to  twice  the  level  required  for  canning 
purposes.  The  EU  Commission  forwarded  on 
June  20  data  on  the  withdrawal  program  and 
other  canned  fruit  programs  that  was  requested 
last  February  by  a  G-6  group  of  countries  (United 
States,  Australia,  Argentina,  Chile,  Brazil  and 
South  Africa)  that  expressed  concern  with  losses 
of  export  market  share  to  subsidized  EU 
competition. 

Mexico  initiates  anti-dumping  duty 
investigation  on  canned  peaches 

On  May  26  the  Secretariat  of  Commerce 
announced  acceptance  of  a  petition  to 
investigate  a  subsidy  and  dumping  claim  against 
exports  to  Mexico  of  Greek  canned  peaches  in 
halves  with  syrup.  The  petition  was  made  by  the 
processing  company  “Conservas  la  Torre” 
alleging  export  subsidies,  price  discrimination  and 
injury  to  the  Mexican  industry.  The  investigation 
will  be  based  on  actions  taking  place  between 
April-December  1996.  All  interested  parties  have 
30  working  days  from  May  26  to  provide 
comments.

Poland  reduces  tariffs  slightly  for  some 
horticultural  product  imports 

Poland's  Council  of  Ministers  has  approved  new 
tariffs  and  tariff  regulations  for  1997,  which  will 
somewhat  reduce  import  tariffs  for  many 
horticultural  products.  The  new  tariff  levels 
become  effective  July  1,  1997.  The  tariff 
reductions  reflect  Poland's  World  Trade 
Organization  (WTO)  commitments  to  reduce 
import  tariffs  over  time.  In  accordance  with 
WTO  agreements,  Poland  updates  its  customs 
schedule  every  6  months  to  reflect  adjustments 
to  import  tariffs  or  new  trade  agreements.  Some 
agricultural  products  for  which  applied  tariffs 
were  slightly  reduced  include  fresh  fruits  (dates, 
figs,  avocados),  fresh  vegetables,  raisins,  coffee, 
tea,  pepper,  vanilla,  cocoa  beans,  selected 
processed  fruits  and  vegetables,  and  selected 
wines  and  liquors.  Poland  also  liquidated  an 
across-the-board  border  tax,  which  in  1996  was 
3  percent  for  all  imports. 

In  an  unusual  development,  not  connected  with 
Poland's  WTO  commitments,  the  Polish 
government  reduced  the  value  add  tax  (VAT) 
applied  to  fresh  citrus  from  22  percent  to  7 
percent.  The  change  will  become  effective  on 
January  1,  1998. 

EU  Commission  targets  new  fruits  for 
import  licensing 

On  Friday,  June  1 3,  the  EU  Commission 
published  a  regulation  establishing  a  modified  list 
of  fresh  fruits  that  require  import  licenses.  After 
reviewing  the  trigger  volumes  set  forth  under  the 
Uruguay  Round  special  safeguards  for  fruit  and 
vegetables,  the  Commission  decided  to  eliminate 
the  import  license  requirement  for  apples,  pears, 
and  clementines.  Import  volumes  of  these 
products  reportedly  never  reached  the  trigger 
levels.  However,  the  Commission  added  table 
grapes  and  cherries  to  the  list  of  products  for 
which  import  licenses  are  required  during  their 
respective  entry  price  periods.  The  Commission 
also  changed  the  periods  for  which  licenses  are 
necessary  for  lemons  and  cucumbers.  For 
lemons,  the  new  period  is  September  1  through 
May  30,  rather  than  all  year.  For  cucumbers,  the 

July  1997  14 


new  period  is  November  1  through  April  30, 
rather  than  May  1  through  October  31. 

The  EU  Commission  uses  the  import  license 
requirement  ostensibly  to  monitor  import  volumes 
for  the  special  agricultural  safeguard,  provided 
under  the  Uruguay  Round  agriculture  agreement. 
Should  actual  imports  of  a  covered  product 
during  the  entry  price  period  exceed  the  trigger 
volume,  the  EU  can  temporarily  invoke  the 
special  safeguard  and  raise  the  import  tariff  on 
the  product.  The  EU  special  safeguard  scheme 
calls  for  a  duty  increase  equal  to  one  third  of 
both,  the  applied  ad  valorem  duty  and  any 
additional  tariffs  (some  fruits  and  vegetables  are 
subject  to  both,  an  ad  valorem  duty  plus 
additional  tariffs,  which  vary  according  to  the 
entry  price  and  entry  period).  For  example,  in  the 
event  imports  of  cherries  between  May  21  and 
August  10  of  this  year  exceed  35,721  metric 
tons,  the  EU  can  raise  the  tariff  during  the  entry 
price  period  by  one  third  of  the  applied  ad 
valorem  duty  plus  one  third  of  any  additional 
tariff.

WORLD  FRESH  CITRUS  SITUATION 


Citrus  production  in  selected  countries  in  1996/97  is  forecast  at  a  record  68.1 
million  metric  tons,  3  percent  above  the  previous  year's  output.  Oranges  account 
for  most  of  this  increase.  The  amount  of  oranges  expected  to  be  processed  in 
1996/97  is  forecast  at  a  record  28.9  million  tons,  8  percent  above  the  previous 
year's  level.  More  citrus  is  expected  to  be  processed  because  of  record  orange 
harvests  in  Florida  and  Sao  Paulo.  Selected  country  fresh  citrus  exports,  however, 
are  forecast  to  decrease  6  percent  due  mainly  to  a  smaller  harvest  in  Spain,  the 
world's  largest  fresh  citrus  exporter.  The  United  States  and  South  Africa  are 
expected  to  expand  fresh  citrus  exports  in  1996/97,  due  partly  to  a  forecast  14 
percent  drop  in  Spain's  exports. 


Summary 

Total  citrus  production  in  1996/97  in  major 
producing  countries  is  estimated  at  a  record  68 
million  tons,  up  3  percent  from  the  1995/96 
crop.  Larger  crops  in  Brazil  and  the  United 
States,  in  addition  to  moderate  gains  in  Greece 
and  South  Africa,  account  for  most  of  this 
increase.  Orange  production  in  1996/97  in 
selected  countries  is  forecast  at  a  record  45.6 
million  tons,  up  4  percent  from  last  year,  and  up 
17  percent  since  1991/92.  A  12  percent 
increase  in  Brazil  and  a  6  percent  increase  in  the 
United  States  account  for  most  of  the  higher 
orange  output.  Grapefruit  production  is  forecast 
to  increase  7  percent  based  on  a  record  U.S. 
harvest.  The  production  of  tangerines  and  lemons 
in  selected  countries  in  1996/97  is  forecast 
unchanged  from  the  previous  year. 

Citrus  exports  for  selected  countries  in  1996/97 
are  forecast  at  7.6  million  tons,  down  6  percent 
from  the  previous  year's  volume.  An  expected 
14  percent  decrease  in  Spain's  citrus  exports  is 
expected  to  more  than  offset  higher  shipments 
from  the  United  States  and  South  Africa.  Spain's 
exports  are  forecast  to  decrease  due  to  a  smaller 
citrus  harvest. 

Citrus  processing  in  1996/97  is  forecast  at  a 
record  28.9  million  tons,  7  percent  above  last 
year's  level.  The  United  States  and  Brazil 


account  for  the  most  of  the  increase  in 
processing,  due  to  larger  orange  harvests. 

Southern  Hemisphere 

Total  citrus  production  in  1997  (corresponds  to 
the  1 996/97  in  the  tables  in  the  statistical 
section)  in  selected  countries  in  the  Southern 
Hemisphere  is  forecast  at  23.4  million  metric 
tons,  up  9  percent  from  1996.  A  forecast  8 
percent  increase  in  Brazil's  orange  crop  accounts 
for  most  of  the  production  upturn.  Brazilian 
orange  production  accounts  for  more  than  80 
percent  of  total  Southern  Hemisphere  citrus 
output. 

Fresh  citrus  exports  by  selected  Southern 
Hemisphere  countries  in  1 997  are  forecast  at  1 .3 
million  tons,  up  4  percent  from  the  previous 
year's  shipments.  South  Africa  is  expected  to 
account  for  the  bulk  of  the  increase  in  Southern 
Hemisphere  exports.  The  devaluation  of  the 
Rand  against  other  major  international  currencies 
has  helped  South  African  exports  to  be  more 
price  competitive  in  international  markets. 

Brazil 

The  total  Brazilian  citrus  crop  in  1 997  (harvested 
June  through  December  1 997)  is  forecast  at  1 9.7 
million  tons,  up  12  percent  from  the  1996 
estimate.  Total  fresh  orange  production  in  1 997 


July  1997  15  World  Horticultural  Trade  & 

U.S.  Export  Opportunities 


is  forecast  at  a  record  18.3  million  tons,  8 
percent  above  last  year's  revised  estimate.  In 
Sao  Paulo,  the  main  producing  region  of  fresh 
oranges,  production  is  expected  to  increase  9 
percent,  to  400  million  40.8  kilogram  boxes. 
Production  in  other  citrus  producing  regions  is 
forecast  to  remain  stable.  The  increase  in  the 
Sao  Paulo  is  largely  attributed  to  more  trees 
coming  into  production,  expected  higher  box/tree 
yields  based  on  favorable  weather  during  the 
flowering  period  and  an  increasing  number  of 
trees  in  the  higher  yielding  age  groups.  Producer 
and  trade  source  orange  production  forecasts  for 
Sao  Paulo  range  from  380  to  405  million  boxes. 

The  number  of  citrus  growers  in  Sao  Paulo  has 
recently  been  decreasing,  with  the  inefficient 
ones  being  forced  out  of  business.  However,  the 
number  of  citrus  trees  owned  by  large  producers 
as  a  percentage  of  total  trees  has  been 
increasing  vis-a-vis  small  producers.  Grove  care, 
particularly  by  small  producers,  has  decreased  in 
comparison  to  previous  crops  as  a  result  of 
increased  financial  difficulties  due  to  higher 
chemical  product  and  fertilizer  prices  and  disease 
problems.  The  outbreak  of  the  disease  Citrus 
Chlorosis  Variegated  (CVC  or  “amarelinho”)  has 
sharply  increased  the  costs  of  grove 
management,  and  many  of  the  producers  cannot 
afford  the  costs  of  pruning  the  infected  branches 
or  having  to  erradicate  trees  with  the  disease. 
Moreover,  the  end  of  the  master  contract  in 
recent  years  has  resulted  in  another  burden  on 
producers,  since  they  are  not  used  to  picking  and 
hauling  fruit  to  the  processing  plant. 

The  Sao  Paulo  State  Secretariat  of  Agriculture 
has  proposed  the  creation  of  a  Citrus 
Commission,  comprised  of  representatives  of 
different  sectors  of  the  citrus  industry  and 
subordinated  to  the  Sao  Paulo  State  Secretariat 
of  Agriculture  to  establish  a  citrus  policy  and  to 
respond  to  citrus  related  issues.  The  setting  of 
an  orange  reference  price  for  producers,  in 
addition  to  the  establishment  of  future  measures 
for  monitoring  and  controlling  citrus  canker, 
would  be  the  responsibilities  for  the  commission. 

Domestic  orange  consumption  in  Brazil  in  1997  is 
forecast  at  5.9  million  tons,  up  6  percent  from 
the  previous  year's  revised  estimate. 


Consumption  has  been  increasing  since  the 
implementation  of  the  economic  stabilization  plan 
(Real  Plan),  in  July  1994,  which  increased  the 
purchasing  power  of  the  lower  and  lower-middle 
classes.  Orange  prices  have  also  decreased  in 
the  domestic  market  in  the  past  4  years,  making 
oranges  more  affordable  to  the  consumer.  In 
addition,  the  consumption  of  not-from- 
concentrate  orange  juice  (fresh  or  pasteurized) 
continues  to  rise.  Also,  the  shift  in  marketing 
oranges  from  units  (price  per  dozen)  to  weight 
(price  per  kilogram)  and  the  presence  of  juicers, 
who  process  orange  juice  and  sell  it  in  the 
informal  economy,  have  contributed  to  a  higher 
consumption  of  oranges. 

Fresh  orange  exports  in  1997  are  forecast 
unchanged  from  the  previous  year.  The  majority 
of  the  fruit  is  shipped  to  the  Netherlands. 

The  amount  of  oranges  for  processing  in  1 997  is 
forecast  at  a  record  1 2.6  million  tons,  1 6  percent 
above  the  previous  year.  More  oranges  are 
expected  to  be  processed  based  on  the  record 
harvest.  Sao  Paulo  is  expected  to  increase  its 
processing  volume,  while  processing  in  other 
regions  remains  constant. 

Argentina 

Argentina's  total  citrus  production  in  1997  is 
forecast  at  1 .9  million  tons,  2  percent  below  the 
previous  year.  A  4-percent  increase  in  the 
lemon  crop  is  not  enough  to  offset  slight 
decreases  in  other  citrus  fruits  due  to  drought  in 
other  citrus  producing  areas.  Argentina's  lemon 
production  is  forecast  at  a  record  750,000  tons. 
This  increase  is  due  mainly  to  very  good  weather 
condition  and  more  trees  coming  into 
production.  The  orange  crop  in  1997  is  forecast 
to  decrease  5  percent  to  670,000  tons.  The 
forecast  drop  is  attributed  to  the  trees  entering  a 
rest  phase  following  very  good  output  last  year. 
Both  the  tangerine  and  grapefruit  crops  are 
forecast  to  be  smaller  than  last  year,  yielding 
320,000  and  200,000  tons,  respectively.  This 
drop  in  production  is  mainly  due  to  poor  weather 
conditions. 

Domestic  consumption  of  fresh  citrus  in  1 997  is 
forecast  to  decrease  by  5  percent,  reflecting  the 


July  1997  16  World  Horticultural  Trade  & 

U.S.  Export  Opportunities 


slight  decrease  in  supplies  in  the  most  popular 
citrus  fruits.  In  addition,  the  purchasing  power  of 
the  Argentine  consumer  is  deteriorating. 

Total  citrus  exports  in  1997  are  forecast  to 
decrease  8  percent  to  298,000  tons  in  1997. 
This  drop  is  due  mainly  to  the  devaluation  of  the 
European  currency  versus  the  U.S.  dollar.  Since 
all  Argentine  citrus  exports  are  priced  in  U.S. 
dollars,  the  fruit  is  more  expensive  overseas  and 
therefore  harder  to  sell.  In  the  case  of  lemons, 
Argentine  exports  to  Spain  are  forecast  to  drop 
due  to  improved  weather  conditions  which 
increased  the  size  of  Spain's  lemon  crop. 
Orange,  tangerine,  and  grapefruit  exports  are  also 
forecast  to  decrease,  due  to  the  expected  smaller 
harvests.  Argentina's  citrus  imports  in  1  997  are 
forecast  unchanged  at  8,000  tons,  which  are 
comprised  completely  of  grapefruit. 

Processing  in  Argentina  is  forecast  to  increase  6 
percent  in  1997.  This  increase  is  the  result  of  a 
record  lemon  harvest,  expected  lower  fresh 
exports,  and  more  damaged  oranges  not  fit  for 
domestic  consumption. 

South  Africa 

Total  South  Africa  citrus  production  is  forecast  in 
1997  to  reach  a  record  1.22  million  tons. 
Orange  production,  which  accounts  for  up  to  75 
percent  of  the  total  citrus  crop,  is  forecast  to 
increase  2  percent  over  last  season.  The  main 
orange  variety  produced  is  Valencia,  followed  by 
Navel. 

Total  citrus  exports  in  1997  are  forecast  to 
increase  8  percent  to  a  record  817,000  tons.  In 
1996,  approximately  65  percent  of  South 
Africa's  orange  exports  went  to  the  European 
Union,  the  Middle  East,  Far  East,  and  Southern 
African  countries.  For  most  of  1996,  the  South 
African  currency  depreciated  against  major 
international  currencies  such  as  the  U.S.  Dollar, 
British  Pound,  and  the  Japanese  Yen.  The 
depreciating  Rand  resulted  in  South  African  citrus 
exports  being  more  price  competitive  against 
other  exporters.  Increased  market  development 
activities  overseas  also  contributed  to  the  higher 
exports. 


Australia 

Total  citrus  production  in  1997  is  forecast  at 
579,000  tons,  about  the  same  as  the  previous 
year's  output.  Production  of  individual  orange 
varieties  has  continued  to  change  in  recent  years. 
In  1997,  Valencia  production  is  forecast  to  fall  by 
31,000  tons,  while  Navel  production  is  forecast 
to  increase  by  32,000  tons.  Industry  sources 
believe  that  as  many  as  600,000  Valencia  trees 
may  have  been  removed.  This  trend  has  been 
partially  a  result  of  the  wide  fluctuations  in 
processing  returns  for  Valencia  oranges. 

Total  citrus  exports  in  1 997  are  forecast  to  reach 
120,000  tons,  an  increase  of  1 1  percent  over  the 
1996  season.  Most  of  the  increase  is  expected 
to  be  in  oranges.  Increased  shipments  to  South 
East  Asian  markets  are  also  expected.  Last  year 
exports  to  Malaysia,  Singapore,  Flong  Kong, 
Indonesia,  and  Japan  accounted  for  close  to  80 
percent  of  Australia's  total  orange  exports. 
Exports  to  the  U.S.  also  increased. 

Citrus  for  processing  in  1997  is  forecast  at 
235,000  tons,  9  percent  less  than  the  amount 
processed  in  1996.  Oranges  account  for  94 
percent  of  all  fresh  citrus  processed.  Some 
lemons  are  also  processed  into  juice. 

Revised  Northern  Hemisphere 

Production 

Data  for  the  Northern  Hemisphere  have  been 
revised  since  the  February  issue  of  the  World 
Horticultural  Trade  &  U.S.  Export  Opportunities. 

However,  total  citrus  production  in  the  Northern 
Hemisphere  for  1996/97  is  forecast  unchanged 
from  the  February  estimate. 

Greece's  lemon  and  orange  production  in 
1996/97  were  increased  11  and  6  percent, 
respectively,  due  to  more  trees  in  production 
than  earlier  expected.  The  tangerine  production 
forecast  was  reduced  8  percent  to  2.4  million 
tons. 

Korea's  tangerine  production  was  reduced  13 
percent  to  480,000  tons.  This  drop  is  due  mainly 


July  1997  17  World  Horticultural  Trade  & 

U.S.  Export  Opportunities 


to  more  trees  in  production. 


Citrus  production  estimates  for  Italy,  Spain,  and 
Mexico  were  revised  slightly. 

Exports 

The  total  Northern  Hemisphere  citrus  export 
forecast  for  1996/97  is  unchanged  from  the 
February  estimate,  but  down  8  percent  from  last 
year's  shipments. 

Processing 

The  total  Northern  Hemisphere  citrus  processing 
forecast  for  1996/97  was  reduced  2  percent  to 
15  million  tons.  A  reduction  in  the  U.S. 
grapefruit  processing  estimate  accounts  for  most 
of  the  decrease. 

U.S.  consumption  of  grapefruit  is  forecast  to 
increase  12  percent  from  the  February  estimate. 
This  higher  apparent  consumption  estimate 
includes  fruit  that  may  be  left  unharvested  on  the 
trees.  The  record  1996/97  grapefruit  crop, 
combined  with  lower  fresh  exports  than  initially 
expected,  large  grapefruit  juice  stocks,  and  low 
producer  prices  could  result  in  3  million  boxes  of 
grapefruit  being  abandoned  on  the  trees. 

The  Korean  citrus  processing  forecast  for 
1996/97  is  down  60  percent  from  the  February 
estimate  to  12,000  tons.  A  sharp  drop  in  citrus 
production  accounts  for  this  decrease.  Smaller 
crops  in  Italy,  Mexico,  and  Morocco  also  account 
for  reduced  processing  estimates  for  Italy, 
Mexico,  and  Morocco.

30  World  Horticultural  Trade  & 

U.S.  Export  Opportunities 


Processed  Tomato  Products  Situation 
and  Outlook  in  Selected  Countries 


Canned  tomato  and  tomato  paste  production  in  selected  countries  in  1 997/98 
are  forecast  at  1.6  and  1.3  million  metric  tons,  down  21  and  10  percent  from 
the  previous  season,  respectively.  The  production  decline  in  canned  tomatoes 
is  due  largely  to  lower  output  in  Italy,  which  accounts  for  over  80  percent  of 
selected  country  production.  Production  was  down  in  Italy  due  to  reduced 
planted  area,  a  severe  frost  last  spring,  and  large  carry-in  stocks.  Lower  tomato 
paste  production  in  1997/98  is  expected  in  most  European  countries,  with  the 
exception  of  France,  where  production  remained  the  same.  Despite  the  expected 
sharp  decrease  in  canned  tomato  production,  exports  in  1997/98  are  forecast 
to  decrease  only  1  percent  as  Italy  is  expected  to  reduce  stocks  in  order  to  meet 
export  demand.  Tomato  paste  exports  in  1997/98  are  forecast  to  increase  5 
percent  to  937,000  tons  despite  lower  production.  All  selected  countries  are 
expected  to  expand  tomato  paste  exports  except  for  Chile,  Greece  and  France. 
U.S.  tomato  paste  exports  for  the  first  9  months  of  marketing  year  (July-June) 
1996/97  have  already  reached  a  record  98,472  tons,  12  percent  above  the 
previous  year's  complete  marketing  year  total. 


Summary 


Production  downswings  for  canned  tomatoes  and 
tomato  paste  in  selected  countries  in  1997/98 
occurred  mainly  from  large  carry-in  stocks. 


Production  of  processing  tomatoes  in  1 1  major 
producing  countries  in  1  997  is  forecast  at  20.28 
million  metric  tons,  down  7  percent  from  1996, 
due  largely  to  lower  prices  and  high  carryover 
stocks.  This  decline  is  expected  to  be  somewhat 
offset  with  moderate  production  increases  in 
Brazil,  Mexico,  Portugal  and  France.  In  Italy,  a 
large  draw-down  of  stocks  in  1997  is  expected 
to  lower  the  Italian  production  this  season. 


Tomato  paste  exports  in  marketing  year  1997/98 
in  selected  countries  forecast  at  937,000  tons 
are  expected  to  increase  about  5  percent  above 
the  previous  year's  level  despite  lower 
production.  Italy,  Mexico,  Portugal  and  Greece 
accounted  for  most  of  the  increase.  During  the 
first  9  months  of  marketing  year  (July-June) 
1996/97,  U.S.  tomato  paste  exports  totaled 
98,472  tons,  up  49  percent  from  the  same  time 
the  previous  year.  In  1995/96,  U.S.  exports 
totaled  88,000  tons,  with  Canada  and  Asian 
countries  taking  the  bulk  of  all  shipments.

United  States 

Large  U.S.  carryover  reduces  U.S. 

processing  output 

Production  of  tomatoes  for  processing  under  contract 
in  the  United  States  in  1 997  is  forecast  at  9.34  million 
tons,  down  10  percent  from  the  previous  year.  This 
decline  is  due  largely  to  lower  wholesale  prices 
received  for  tomato  products  over  the  past  year,  and 
record  carryover  stocks  resulting  from  large  packs  the 
last  few  years.  Also,  domestic  use  has  apparently 
slowed  with  most  of  the  growth  in  use  coming  from 
export  demand.  According  to  USDA's  Economic 


Research  Service  (ERS),  exports  now  account  for  about 
6  percent  of  total  domestic  supply  (production  plus 
imports  plus  beginning  stocks).  The  area  contracted  to 
be  planted  in  1997  is  estimated  at  121,500  hectares, 
down  13  percent  from  1  996.  California  accounted  for 
92  percent  of  the  processing  tomato  acreage  in  the 
United  States  in  1996. 

The  United  States  is  the  world’s  largest  producer  of 
processed  tomato  products,  with  tomato  concentrates 
(especially  tomato  paste,  sauces  and  catsup) 
accounting  for  the  majority  of  the  products.  Statistics 
for  U.S.  tomato  paste  production  are  not  available. 


July  1997

Wholesale  prices  for  tomato  products  down 

Continued  low  prices,  new  product  introductions,  and 
recent  health  claims  associated  with  lycopene  in 
tomatoes  (with  processing  tomatoes  singled  out  as 
strong  carriers),  could  help  jump-start  domestic 
demand  in  the  coming  year. 

According  to  ERS,  the  California  Tomato  Growers 
Association  (representing  the  majority  of  processing 
tomato  growers)  and  tomato  processors  have  agreed 
upon  an  average  field  price  of  $51  per  short  ton 
($56.22  per  mertic  ton)  for  ripe  tomatoes  for  the  1  997 
season.  This  price  is  down  from  $53  per  short  ton 
($58.42  per  metric  ton)  average  negotiated  last  year 
but  is  about  the  same  as  2  years  ago. 

The  lower  price  for  the  coming  crop  reflects  the  soft 
wholesale  prices  that  have  been  prevalent  in  the 
market  since  last  fall.  For  example,  reported  prices  for 
fancy  31  percent  tomato  paste  in  55  gallon  drums 
averaged  $0.30  per  pound  during  the  first  quarter  of 
1997,  down  17  percent  from  a  year  earlier  and  the 
third  consecutive  annual  decline. 

Strong  export  demand  fuels  U.S.  tomato 
market  with  record  year-to-date  mark 

During  the  first  9  months  of  marketing  year  1996/97 
(July-March),  U.S.  exports  of  tomato  products--  canned 
tomatoes,  tomato  paste,  tomato  sauce  and  ketchup 
totaled  216,000  tons  valued  at  $171  million,  up  25 
percent  in  volume  and  16  percent  in  value  from  the 
same  period  a  year  earlier.  Canada,  Japan,  Chile  (a  big 
buyer  for  the  first  time),  Mexico  (buying  record 
volumes),  Italy,  Dominican  Republic,  Haiti  and  the 
United  Kingdom  were  the  most  important  export 
markets  during  this  period.  Accounting  for  the 
strongest  export  performance  of  the  tomato  products 
were  tomato  paste  (19  percent)  and  tomato  sauce  (18 
percent).  Exports  of  canned  tomatoes  and  ketchup 
during  the  same  period  accounted  for  increases  of  8 
and  2  percent,  respectively. 

U.  S.  imports  from  EU  up  dramatically 

During  the  first  9  months  of  marketing  year  1996/97 
(July-March),  U.S.  imports  of  canned  tomatoes  from 
the  EU  totaled  36,000  tons,  up  85  percent  from  the 
same  period  the  previous  year.  Imports  from  Italy 


totaling  32,000  tons  accounted  for  86  percent  of  total 
EU  shipments  to  the  U.S.  during  this  period.  The 
United  States'  removal  of  the  100  percent  punitive 
duty  on  imports  of  Italian,  Spanish  and  other  EU 
canned  tomatoes  in  July  1  996  was  the  primary  factor 
for  this  increase.  This  duty  had  been  originally 
imposed  in  response  to  the  EU/U.S.  beef  hormone 
dispute.  During  the  same  period,  imports  from  Spain 
totaling  over  4,000  tons,  rose  105  percent  above  the 
year  earlier. 

Mexico 

Mexico's  processing  production  up 

Production  of  processing  tomatoes,  consisting  mostly 
of  tomato  paste,  in  Mexico  in  1997  is  estimated  at 
200,000  tons,  up  43  percent  from  1996.  This  increase 
is  attributed  primarily  to  an  increase  in  harvested  area 
and  an  increase  in  export  demand  for  tomato  paste. 

In  Mexico,  there  are  seven  tomato  paste  processing 
plants  in  operation.  The  majority  of  these  plants  are 
located  in  the  state  of  Sinaloa,  and  operate  from  March 
to  June.  These  plants  are  controlled  by  both  Mexican 
and  multi-national  firms  who  produce  paste  under  their 
own  labels  and  for  use  in  other  products  such  as 
catsup,  sauce,  hot  sauce,  sardines,  and  other  paste 
products. 

Most  of  the  tomatoes  for  processing  are  contracted  by 
the  processors  directly  with  local  growers.  Tomato 
paste  is  made  at  different  concentrations  depending  on 
the  use:  29,  31,  36  and  44  degrees  brix. 

Domestic  consumption  of  tomato  paste  in  Mexico  in 
1997/98  is  estimated  to  remain  unchanged  at  about 
10,000  tons. 

Brazil 

Tomatoes  for  processing  up  significantly 

Production  of  tomatoes  for  processing  in  Brazil  in  1997 
is  estimated  at  1 .0  million  tons,  up  47  percent  from  the 
revised  1996  volume,  due  mostly  to  an  increase  in 
harvested  area  and  greater  demand  for  processed 
tomato  products. 


July  1997 


33 


World  Horticultural  Trade  & 
U.S.  Export  Opportunities 


Tomatoes  are  produced  in  all  states  of  Brazil,  mainly 
for  fresh  consumption.  In  Brazil,  about  70  to  75 
percent  of  processing  tomatoes  go  into  tomato  paste 
and  extracts.  The  majority  of  the  paste  is  used  in 
further  processing  into  consumer-ready  sauces  and 
other  such  products.  Production  of  tomato  paste  in 
Brazil  in  1997  is  estimated  at  107,000  tons,  up  47 
percent  from  1996,  due  mostly  to  increased  domestic 
consumption.  Production  of  canned  tomatoes  in  1  997 
is  estimated  at  1,200  tons,  up  50  percent  from  the 
year  earlier,  also  due  to  a  stronger  domestic  demand. 

Planting  of  tomatoes  in  Brazil  begins  in  February  and 
ends  around  June,  while  harvesting  starts  in  June  and 
runs  through  October  and  November. 

Change  in  consumer  preference 

Reflecting  similar  changes  throughout  South  America, 
a  shift  in  Brazilian  consumption  patterns  toward 
consumer-ready  tomato  products  will  continue  to  rise 
in  the  near  term  and  beyond.  As  urbanization  becomes 
a  real  fact  of  life,  fewer  people  have  time  to  go  home 
for  lunch.  Increasing  consumption  of  fast  foods,  less 
time  to  go  shopping  for  fresh  produce,  more  women 
entering  the  work  force,  and  more  people  moving  to 
the  cities  have  all  contributed  to  a  dietary  shift  in  Brazil 
toward  foods  that  contain  processed  tomato  products. 

Trade  situation 

Most  Brazilian  imports  of  tomato  products  are  paste 
(imported  in  28-32  degrees  brix),  which  is  further 
processed  in  Brazil  into  consumer-ready  sauces  and 
other  similar  products.  Approximately,  80  percent  of 
Brazil's  tomato  product  imports  come  from  Chile.  The 
European  Union  and  Argentina  account  for  most  of  the 
remaining  total.  In  1995,  Brazil  imported  32,000  tons 
of  tomato  paste,  18,000  tons  of  other  tomatoes,  and 
8,000  tons  of  tomatoes  whole  peeled  and  pieces.  U.S. 
exports  of  other  tomato  products  to  Brazil  were  zero  in 
1994,  and  rose  to  3,000  tons  in  1995.  With  an 
apparent  short  crop  in  1996,  Brazilian  imports  of 
tomato  and  tomato  products  are  estimated  to 
approximate  1995  levels. 


Chile 

Processed  tomato  production  down 

Production  of  tomatoes  for  processing  in  Chile  in  1  997 
is  estimated  at  886,000  tons,  down  12  percent  from 
1996  due  to  severe  drought  in  major  producing  regions 
of  the  country  (La  Serena  and  Talca).  In  the  coming 
years,  the  expansion  of  planted  area  to  tomatoes  can 
be  expected  to  occur  at  a  slower  pace  than  in  the  past, 
as  a  result  of  dwindling  labor  availability  and  the  fact 
that  the  tomato  industry  in  Chile  is  operating  almost  at 
full  capacity. 

Tomatoes  for  processing  are  planted  from  mid- 
September  through  early  December  and  harvested  from 
January  10  through  April  1 5.  For  the  planting  season, 
frosts  are  an  important  limiting  factor. 

Chile 's  processing  industry 

The  current  annual  installed  capacity  for  processing 
tomatoes  in  Chile  is  about  120,000  to  140,000  tons. 
Chile's  processing  tomato  industry  produces  mostly 
tomato  paste  and  canned  tomatoes  (whole-peeled, 
diced-peeled  and  crushed).  Tomato  paste  in  Chile  is 
produced  in  30  to  32  degrees  brix.  However,  a  28  to 
30  degree  brix  is  produced  for  exports  to  Japan. 

In  1997,  tomato  paste  production  in  Chile  totaled 
slightly  over  100,000  tons,  down  17  percent  from 
1996,  due  to  a  reduction  in  planted  area  caused  by 
severe  drought.  Production  of  canned  tomatoes  during 
the  same  time  period  totaled  27,000  tons,  down  7 
percent  from  1996,  also  due  to  drought  problems. 

Tomato  paste  exports  up 

Tomato  paste  exports  in  1997  are  estimated  at  90,000 
tons,  down  20  percent  from  1996,  due  mostly  to  a 
lower  output.  Industry  contacts  in  Chile  indicate  that 
in  the  short  term,  a  much  slower  rate  of  export  growth 
for  tomato  paste  can  be  expected  to  occur  due  to 
increased  competition  from  nearby  countries, 
particularly  Peru.  In  1995,  Brazil,  Japan,  Italy, 
Venezuela  and  the  United  States  were  Chile's  best 
tomato  paste  customers.

Mediterranean  Area 
European  Union 

The  1  997  harvest  of  tomatoes  for  processing  in  the 
major  producing  countries  of  the  European  Union  (EU) 
is  estimated  at  7.16  million  metric  tons,  down  9 
percent  from  1996.  The  EU's  1996/97  minimum 
grower  prices  for  processing  tomatoes,  in  ECU  terms, 
remain  unchanged  at  9.549  ECU  per  100  kilograms  for 
tomatoes  to  be  processed  into  paste,  juice,  or  non¬ 
whole  products;  15.807  ECU  per  100  kilograms  for 
whole  San  Marzano  variety  tomatoes;  and  12.161  ECU 
for  whole  Roma  variety  tomatoes  and  tomatoes  for 
producing  flakes.  See  the  FHORT  March  1997  article 
for  more  details  on  the  EU  reformed  Common 
Organization  of  the  Market  for  Fruits  and  Vegetables. 

Italy 

Production  down  significantly 

Production  of  tomatoes  for  processing  in  Italy  in  1  997 
is  estimated  at  3.5  million  tons,  down  16  percent  from 
1996,  due  to  a  decline  in  planted  area  and  a  severe 
frost  last  spring  (1997)  which  affected  the  entire 
Italian  tomato  crop.  The  EU  approved  production  quota 
for  Italy  in  1997  is  3.47  million  tons,  which  is  broken 
down  as  follows:  1.76  million  tons  for  tomato  paste; 
1 .09  million  tons  for  whole  canned  tomatoes;  and  0.62 
million  tons  for  other  canned  tomatoes. 

Area  planted  to  tomatoes  for  processing  in  1997  is 
currently  estimated  at  85,000  hectares,  up  6  percent 
from  the  previous  year.  The  bulk  of  Italy's  processing 
season  is  concentrated  in  August  and  September,  but 
in  some  years  continues  to  October. 

Tomato  sauce  production 

The  trend  for  tomato  sauce  production  in  Italy 
continues  to  grow.  In  1997,  tomato  sauce  production 
is  estimated  at  44,000  tons,  up  2  percent  from  1996. 
Exports  accounted  for  39  percent  of  total  production  in 
1996,  with  the  EU  countries,  primarily  Germany, 
France  and  the  United  Kingdom  being  the  largest 
customers. 


July  1997  35 


In  the  FHORT  March  1997  circular  report,  the  U.S. 
elimination  of  the  100  percent  punitive  duty  on  Italian 
canned  tomato  imports  into  the  United  States  was 
discussed. 

Portugal 

Production  up  slightly 

Production  of  tomatoes  for  processing  in  Portugal  in 
1997  is  estimated  at  910,000  tons,  up  slightly  from 
last  year's  record.  Tomato  paste,  which  accounts  for 
the  bulk  of  Portugal's  processed  production,  is 
estimated  at  150,000  tons,  down  8  percent  from 
1  996.  Production  of  other  tomato  products  consists 
mostly  of  diced  tomatoes  (peeled  or  unpeeled),  and 
crushed  tomatoes. 

About  80  percent  of  the  tomatoes  for  processing  are 
grown  in  the  “Ribatejo”,  and  the  remainder  are 
produced  in  the  “Alentejo”  region.  Most  of  these 
tomatoes  are  produced  by  small  farmers  on  5  to  10 
hectare  units.  However,  the  structure  of  the  industry 
is  changing,  and  an  estimated  30  percent  of  all  tomato 
areas  (about  4,350  hectares)  now  consist  of  larger- 
scale  units  with  new  direct-seeding  technologies,  using 
drip  irrigation  systems  and  mechanical  harvesting. 

Paste  exports  up  dramatically 

Portugal's  exports  of  tomato  paste  in  1997  are 
estimated  at  115,000  tons,  up  74  percent  from  the 
previous  year,  due  mostly  to  increased  sales  to  the  EU- 
-the  main  export  market,  Japan,  and  other  Far  and 
Middle  Eastern  countries.  Exports  to  the  United  States 
are  small,  remaining  confined  to  specific  market 
opportunities. 

Greece 

Processing  output  down 

Production  of  processing  tomatoes  in  Greece  in  1997 
is  estimated  at  1.12  million  tons,  down  16  percent 
from  1996,  due  mainly  to  larger  carryover  stocks. 
Tomato  paste  production  accounts  for  the  bulk  of 
Greek  tomatoes  slated  for  processing.  In  1997, 
tomato  paste  production  totaled  192,000  tons,  down 

World  Horticultural  Trade  & 

U.S.  Export  Opportunities 


18  percent  from  1996.  Other  processed  tomato 
products  are  included  in  passata  and  juice.  In  1997, 
the  actual  tonnage  of  fresh  tomatoes  utilized  for  the 
production  of  tomato  juice  (5-7  percent  TSS)  and 
passata  (7-12  percent  TSS)  were  4,500  tons  and 
20,500  tons,  respectively.  Production  of  canned 
tomatoes  in  1997  totaled  slightly  above  25,000  tons, 
about  the  same  as  the  previous  year. 

In  Greece,  tomato  processing  starts  in  Peloponnesos 
around  mid-July  and  ends  about  mid-September,  while 
in  Macedonia,  processing  starts  on  August  1  and  ends 
about  the  first  week  of  October. 

For  additional  details  on  the  EU  minimum  grower  and 
processing  aids  to  canners  for  canned  whole  tomatoes, 
peeled  and  unpeeled,  and  crushed  tomatoes  see  the 
FHORT  March  1997  circular  report. 

Spain 

Processed  production  down 

Production  of  tomatoes  for  processing  in  Spain  in  1 997 
is  estimated  at  1.1  million  tons,  down  12  percent  from 
the  previous  year.  The  lower  output  is  mainly  due  to 
reduced  demand  by  canners,  who  are  holding  huge 
carry-in  stocks.  Area  planted  to  tomatoes  for 
processing  is  forecast  at  24,300  hectares,  up  about  14 
percent  from  the  previous  year. 

Production  of  canned  tomatoes  in  1997  in  Spain  is 
estimated  at  210,000  tons,  down  10  percent  from 
1996.  The  lower  production  volume  is  expected  to  be 
replaced  by  a  significant  drawdown  in  stocks,  allowing 
exports  and  consumption  to  remain  relatively  stable. 
Due  to  high  carry-in  stocks,  tomato  paste  production  is 
forecast  to  decline  about  20  percent  to  1 1 6,000  tons. 

Although  tomatoes  are  widely  grown  in  Spain,  the  east 
coast  (from  Murcia  to  Almeria),  Estremadura,  the 
Canary  Islands  and  the  Ebro  River  basin  (Navarra,  Rioja 
and  Aragon)  accounts  for  about  80  percent  of  the 
Spanish  crop.  About  20  percent  of  the  tomato  crop  is 
harvested  from  January  to  May,  60  percent  from  June 
to  September  and  the  remaining  20  percent  from 
October  to  December.  The  bulk  of  Spain's  tomato 
crop  is  irrigated,  with  some  8,000  hectares  grown  in 
greenhouses. 


July  1997  36 


Consumption  remains  flat 

In  1997,  domestic  consumption  of  canned  tomatoes  is 
estimated  at  175,000  tons  and  tomato  paste  at 
81,000  tons,  about  the  same  as  the  previous  year. 
Consumption  of  canned  tomatoes  and  tomato  paste 
account  for  about  77  and  51  percent  of  total 
utilization,  respectively. 

Tomato  paste  is  generally  used  in  Spain  for  the 
production  of  high  value  tomato  products  such  as 
“tomate  frito”,  other  sauces  and  ketchup.  In  addition, 
between  35,000  and  45,000  tons  of  paste  are  annually 
converted  into  tomato  powder,  which  is  generally 
exported. 

Trade  Situation 

Traditionally,  exports  of  canned  tomato  products  from 
Spain  account  for  about  20-25  percent  of  total 
production,  while  tomato  paste  exports  account  for 
about  50-60  percent  of  total  production.  EU  countries 
purchase  the  bulk  of  Spain's  tomato  product  exports. 

Since  Spain  is  a  net  exporter  of  fresh,  canned 
tomatoes,  and  tomato  products,  there  is  little  potential 
for  U.S.  exports  of  these  products  to  Spain. 

Turkey 

Processing  production  down 

Production  of  tomatoes  for  processing  in  Turkey  in 
1997  is  estimated  at  1.7  million  tons,  down  8  percent 
from  the  previous  year.  The  downswing  in  production 
reflects  a  decrease  in  planted  area,  high  carryover 
stocks,  and  unusually  cold  weather  in  April  that  caused 
tomato  seedlings  to  freeze. 

Approximately  25  percent  of  Turkey's  total  tomato 
crop  is  for  processing,  with  the  balance  slated  for  the 
fresh  market.  Of  the  processed  output,  about  80 
percent  is  used  for  tomato  paste,  15  percent  for 
canned  tomatoes,  and  the  remainder  is  used  for 
catsup,  juice  and  other  tomato  products.  In  1997, 
tomato  paste  production  is  estimated  at  275,000  tons, 
down  8  percent  from  the  previous  year.  High  carryover 
stocks  and  unfavorable  weather  during  the  planting 

World  Horticultural  Trade  & 

U.S.  Export  Opportunities 


season  were  the  primary  causes  for  the  reduction  in 
production  this  year. 

Tomatoes  are  grown  throughout  Turkey  but  the  bulk  of 
production  is  concentrated  in  the  Marmara  region 
(western  Turkey)  and  the  Aegean  region  (southern 
Turkey)  where  climatic  conditions  are  nearly  ideal. 

Turkey  has  an  annual  tomato  paste  capacity  of 
375,000  tons,  the  second  largest  in  Europe  after  Italy 
with  400,000  tons  capacity. 

Tomato  trade  outlook 

Turkey's  tomato  paste  industry  continues  to  depend  on 
exports.  In  recent  years,  exports  to  traditional 
markets,  particularly  Algeria  and  Libya,  have  declined 
sharply  as  a  result  of  chronic  problems  in  these 
importing  countries. 

France 

Processing  production  up  slightly 

Production  of  processing  tomatoes  in  France  in  1997 
is  estimated  at  295,000  tons,  up  2  percent  from  1 996. 
Tomato  paste  production  estimated  at  37,500  tons 
accounted  for  the  bulk  of  total  processing  tomato  use 
in  France  in  1997.  Production  of  canned  tomatoes 
during  the  same  period  totaled  30,000  tons,  up  slightly 
from  the  previous  year. 

The  EU  quota  for  French  production  of  processed 
tomatoes  in  1997  and  1998  has  been  set  at  392,406 
tons  and  369,608  tons,  respectively.  This  production 
is  broken  down  as  follows: 


1996/97  1997/98 

Tomato  paste  278,691  278,691 

Canned  tomatoes  73,628  51,113 

Other  tomatoes  40,087  39,804 

Total  392,406  369,608 


Trade 

French  imports  of  canned  tomatoes  and  tomato  paste 
account  for  the  bulk  of  total  supply.  In  1996,  canned 
tomato  imports  totaled  88,000  tons,  down  slightly 
from  the  year  earlier.  Italy  and  Spain  supplied  over  90 
percent  of  canned  tomato  imports  for  the  period. 

July  1997  37 


Imports  of  tomato  paste  by  France  in  1996  totaled 
48,500  tons,  about  the  same  as  the  previous  year. 
Imports  from  Italy  accounted  for  about  58  percent  of 
the  total,  with  the  other  EU  countries  accounting  for 
most  of  the  balance. 

Israel 

Closure  of  three  processing  plants  lowers 
outturn 

Production  of  processing  tomatoes  in  1 997  in  Israel  is 
estimated  at  220,000  tons,  down  14  percent  from 
1  996,  due  to  additional  closings  of  processing  plants 
resulting  from  low  profits  and  weak  international  prices 
for  tomato  products.  In  1993,  ten  processing  plants 
were  in  operation  while  in  1997,  only  5  plants  remain. 
The  lycopene  plant,  which  processed  23,000  tons  of 
tomatoes  in  1996,  and  is  scheduled  to  process  50,000 
tons  this  year,  will  not  process  any  tomatoes  in  1997, 
due  to  large  accumulation  of  lycopene  stocks  from 
1996. 

In  Israel,  canned  processing  products  include:  whole 
and  diced  peeled  tomatoes,  tomato  paste  and  puree, 
tomato  juice,  ketchup  and  pizza  sauces.  Most  Israeli 
tomato  processors  produce  the  whole  range  of  tomato 
products. 

Tomato  product  consumption  in  Israel  accounts  for 
about  80,000  tons  annually  in  raw  terms,  with  the 
rest  going  to  exports.
