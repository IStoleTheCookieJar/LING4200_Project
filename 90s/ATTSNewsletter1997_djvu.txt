RELATIVES 

In Newsletter 95, I commented on a token I 
had seen in Bob Slawsky’s Auction 45, closing last 
September. I didn’t have a reproducible photo at that 
time. Now I do. Here’s what it looks like. I guess 
the face with the elephant head is supposed to be the 
head and the face with the donkey’s rear end is 
supposed to be the tail - seems sort of obvious when 
you think about it. It is brass, 32 mm. 



Larry Freeman (Parma, OH) sent me a British 
condor token, tax related. I have had pictures en¬ 
larged to 200% so the detail is a little more apparent. 
The inscription on one face is NOTED ADVOCATES 
FOR THE RIGHTS OF MAN. / THOS SPENCE / Sir 


Les Albright (Seattle) sent in this photocopy of 
an item that was in a collection he purchased. It’s a 
pinback with red letters, 20 mm. diameter, aluminum. 
The paper on which it is mounted is pumpkin-colored, 
and the information on it is typewritten. Note the 
"zone number" after Seattle at the bottom. I don’t 
remember just how long they existed, but zone num¬ 
bers were the predecessors of our zip codes. Zip 
codes were established in 1963 according to my 
encyclopedia, so this particular organization, For 
Economic Freedom, must have been handing out these 
buttons about 34 or more years ago.

ICE COMPANY COUPONS 

In the catalog on page 216 there is a comment 
at the bottom about a couple coupons from a Serv-Ice 
Company. Presumably they were some sort of sales 
booklets with coupons used to denote payment and 
with a sales tax receipt attached. Whatever may have 
been the details, Fred Robinson (Canton, OH) sent me 
a coupon booklet serving another vendor of ice (and 
coal - took care of you for both summer and winter). 
Note that it is a book for use in Indianapolis, Indiana, 
which did not have tokens or coupons. But the 
booklet does give some information on how such 
tokens were used. 

I’ve made photocopies at 67 % of some of the 
pages. Presumably a customer bought the coupon 
booklet from the vendor and then turned them in to the 
routeman when he delivered various weights of ice. 
Fred writes: 


receipt are missing. It still is not too hard to 
find 1, 2, and 30 books/pads complete espe¬ 
cially of S259-260 and S261. 

"If you examine the rear portion of the booklet 
you will see that a company name appears. 
This company made some other coupon items. 
Also I have seen ice booklets from Globe 
Ticket Company. On the Globe products the 
back cover is usually blank. 

"My conjecture is that either Superior Printing 
or Scofield Publishing made some salesman 
samples. The law considered water or pro¬ 
cessed water as a human consumption item; 
therefore, not taxable. There was a court case 
defining that utility fees were not taxable. Ice 
was in the hazy or grey area of utilities and 
the ice men didn’t collect tax and no one 
challenged the issue."

S209. On one booklet the first stamp and

ANOTHER "AMUSEMENT TAX"? 

Bill Massey (Marietta, GA) sent up another 
type of coupon booklet. As you can see from the 
illustrations below, it’s a University Single Tax Ticket 
booklet. It seems to contain a packet of tear-off 
coupons that were used to gain admission to various 
events around the University camput, hence my 
thought that these represent still another "amusement 
tax" in operation. 


I can remember from my own days in college 
that we paid a "student fee" that included various 
miscellaneous matters (e.g., the campus newspaper). 
In return we received a similar coupon booklet. 
Sometimes each coupon indicated what it was to be 
used for. In this booklet from Washington University, 
though, the University evidently would designate a 
number to be used for an event, rather than try to have 
the event printed on the coupon.

EDITOR’S NOTES 


CATALOG SUPPLEMENT SHEETS 

Supplement Sheet No. 19-5 provided illustra¬ 
tions of two Ohio Local Issue punchcards, used by 
F.W. Woolworth Co. I had reported that I couldn’t 
read the reverse of L1A, but it looked like it was the 
same as the reverse of LIB. Mike Florer (Framing¬ 
ham, MA) reported "not so," and sent along copies of 
the obverse and reverse of L1A. I have modified 
Sheet No. 19-5 accordingly and included the modified 
version with this issue. On the two reverses, compare 
the third line of the text. LI A was not justified to the 
end of the line; LIB was. 

This issue includes a four-page Supplement 
Sheet on some of the handwritten Missouri milktop 
counterstamps. I really wanted to include them in the 
catalog itself, but had to make some hard choices 
about the cost of the catalog. So now I have them as 
a Supplement Sheet. I included only those of political 
or advertising nature. There are quite a few others 
with person’s names, initials, dates, and so on, but 
they are of interest mostly for the record. 

PERSONAL PLANS 

I’ve had a couple questions about "What are 
you going to do after Marc (and Carl) take over?" 
Never fear, I have some things going on and planned. 
I’ve been working the last 3 Vi years on a catalog of 
coffee tokens (Sambo’s, wooden nickels, metal and 
plastic), and a catalog of school and university tokens 
and commemorative medals. I have to get them 
finished up and printed and available for interested 
collectors. That’ll take a couple more months. 

After the catalogs, my next two projects, on 
which I have begun some preliminary work, involve 
writing. One of the is to prepare a booklet about the 
two federal sales tax tokens/coins that never got 
manufactured. I’ve made some contacts around 


Washington (newspapers and government archives) 
that as far as I know have not been explored and may 
have some illustrations. So that’s one project. The 
other is to get out the Catalog Supplement Sheet with 
color illustrations for the MO, UT, and WA plastic 
sales tax tokens. (That shouldn’t take long once I have 
some time available.) 

And after that, there are others to work on, if 
the cancer hasn’t reared its ugly head again. I know 
I’ve mentioned some things before, such as I want to 
work on the family geneology, although I certainly 
don’t expect to get a lot done - that sort of detailed 
searching through census records, county records 
(York and Lancaster counties, Pennsylvania, mostly), 
and other such sources, takes a lot of time. As far as 
I’ve been able to find out, the Mormons haven’t devel¬ 
oped any records of the family name as yet, so there’s 
no shortcut available. 

I have a large collection of MAD magazines. 

I need to make a complete inventory and then try to 
sell it to some collector or, if necessary, a dealer. I 
have several large boxes of paper materials - letters, 
booklets, etc. - that were left from my parents’ estates. 

I have to sort through them and throw out most, since 
there’s not much that interests my kids. Then, my 
wife and I have a lot of books, some easy to read 
paperbacks and others really "heavy stuff." We’d like 
to give them away to the local library, but it’s closed 
for eighteen months for rehabilitation and isn’t accept¬ 
ing donations of books, so we have to come up with 
some other approach. We have quite a few of the 33V3 
records, mostly in very good shape; we need to 
inventory and sell them. 

And there’s a lot of other things to do. As 
you can see, we are gradually "breaking up" our 
household of forty years so that my wife won’t have 
so much of a mess to deal with after I’m gone, when 
she’ll want to move into smaller quarters.

ATTS PUBLICATIONS 


This is a listing of the publications of the 
American Tax Token Society (ATTS). It also 
includes a few other documents which are not ATTS 
publications but nonetheless are of significant inter¬ 
est. Prices shown are for single copies. Postage is 
included in the cost of most publications but is 
separately indicated where applicable. 

With regard to the Newsletter, members 
receive the entire year’s issues (January through 
December), currently four issues per year, for the 
year of membership. This is true regardless of the 
specific date during the current year that the member 
joined. Each member also receives any other 


materials distributed with the Newsletter during the 
year; some of these materials, but not all, are also 
available at the reprinting cost indicated. There is 
no provision for backdating membership in order to 
receive past Newsletters and other materials at less 
than the reprinting cost indicated. 

The list which follows does not include 
every single issue of the Newsletter, every clipping, 
or every historical catalog, or every article from a 
journal, because that would result in a document of 
about 75 pages. If there is interest in a specific 
article, Newsletter, clipping, etc., a more detailed 
list can be provided or a price can be quoted.

TAX TOKEN TALLY (REPRINTED) 

This is a plastic comb bound reprinting of Mike and Sandra Pfefferkorn’s newsletter. It was the 
predecessor of the ATTS Newsletter, providing a great deal of information that was new at the 
time. It also set the pattern for the cataloging system in Chits, Chiselers, and Funny Money.

ATTS Editor or Secretary-Treasurer. 

CATALOG SUPPLEMENT SHEETS 

These are pages originally issued with a Newsletter, but available separately for members needing 
a copy in later years. They provide information that updates and supplements the ATTS catalog 
by adding new items, giving more detail about minor varieties, providing corrections where 
needed, and so on. Due to their one-page nature, the cost of postage is not prepaid and is 
included in the cost of the sheet. In general they are priced at 10C per printed page, plus 
postage. Several of them consist of more than one page. Write for a detailed list and/or quote 
on any or all. 

CATALOG OF OHIO R5 SCRATCH MARKS, Merlin K. Malehorn $4.00 

This is a personal publication of the author, not an ATTS publication. It is listed here because 
it relates to a specialized aspect of the Ohio sales tax receipts. The Ohio receipt (R5) discussed 
in this publication is OH-S15 in the new catalog. This publication is available from the author 
at 6837 Murray Lane, Annandale, VA 22003. 

CANADIAN SALES TAX RECEIPTS, Merlin K. Malehorn $5.00 

This is a personal publication of the author, not an ATTS publication. It is listed here because 
it is the only known compilation and catalog of a series of provincial sales tax "tickets" used in 
the majority of the Canadian provinces during a period of time when cash registers would not 
ring up and print out the sales tax. It is available from the author at 6837 Murray Lane, 
Annandale, VA 22003. 

SALES TAX TOKENS PRICES, Jerry F. Schimmel $2.00 

This is a personal publication of the author, not an ATTS publication. It is available from Jerry 
F. Schimmel, P.O. Box 40888, San Francisco, CA 94140. It is listed here because it provides 
significant information about prices of sales tax tokens in the 1980s. 

COLLECTING SALES TAX TOKENS: An Introduction, 

Merlin K. Malehorn and Tim Davenport $3.00 

This booklet was written for the individual who is curious about sales tax tokens, and for the 
collector who is just beginning a collection and has very little knowledge about them. 

"HERRIN" SALES TAX TOKENS, Merlin K. Malehorn $11.00 

This is a personal publication of the author, not an ATTS publication. It is listed here because 
it is the only known detailed examination of the history of two tokens purported to be from 
Herrin, Illinois. It also includes a die-by-die analysis, with information that will enable their 
identification, of the 24 different dies of the square Herrin token. It is available from the author 
at 6837 Murray Lane, Annandale, VA 22003. 



HOW TO ORDER AND PAY 


Publications are available from the ATTS 
Editorial Office, 6837 Murray Lane, Annandale, VA 
22003, except for those for which a different address 
is identified. 

Checks for publications that are identified as 
"a personal publication of the author" should be 
made out to the author bv name . 


Checks for other publications should be 
made out to the name of the current ATTS Secre¬ 
tary-Treasurer or Editor. This is necessary because 
it is not always possible to establish or maintain 
separate bank accounts under the title "ATTS," and 
therefore checks made out to ATTS cannot be 
deposited and must be returned for reissuance.

OHIO COLLECTION SYSTEM 

... Richard M. Johnson (L-38) 


Under the collection system used in Ohio, a 
new merchant had to go to the County Auditor to 
obtain a vendor’s license and an identification plate 
bearing the name, location, license number, and type 
of business. Using the plate, the merchant could then 
purchase receipts from any of several sources. In 
1950 the tax department "agents" consisted of 86 
County Treasurers, 216 banks, and 40 private organi¬ 
zations. 


The Sales and Excise section of the Depart¬ 
ment of Taxation was responsible for ordering the 
receipts on an as-need basis. The receipts were 
delivered to the office of the State Treasurer which 
subsequently distributed them to the County treasurers, 
who supplied both vendors and other agents. Supervi¬ 
sion of the private agents, however, fell to the Sales 
Tax Division of the State Auditor’s office. 

The compliance section kept a file on every 
merchant in the state. This included his stamp pur¬ 
chases and his semi-annual ST-10 returns. It was on 
these forms that the merchant had to account for all 
receipts in his possession and provide a record of all 
receipt purchases to include date and amount. If any 
problem arose it was reported to the Audit and Assess¬ 
ment section. In 1949 the state had 110 full-time and 
50 half-time auditors. 


Newsletter for November-December 1989, the re¬ 
deemed stamps were burned in an incinerator at the 
old State School for the Blind.

A DEFINITE MAYBE?? 


Merlin K. Malehorn 


Mr. George Magee, Jr., of Bryn Mawr, PA, was 
probably the most active and influential of the individ¬ 
uals who started collecting, trading, buying and 
selling, sales tax tokens at the very beginning of the 
short historical period encompassing the "sales tax 
token era." He was the first cataloger, among other 
things. Over the years I have served as Editor, he has 


been the source of various short articles and source 
material. He recently sent down the letter which fol¬ 
lows, and asked if perhaps the paper token accom¬ 
panying it would be considered a new find. My 
response, somewhat edited, is on the next page. I’ve 
added columns to make the letter easier to read.

MY COMMENTS: 

I have seen two or three of these little Woolworth slips 
in the past but, lacking any further information, had 
been unable to conclude that they are what we would 
consider to be sales tax tokens. Of course, the phrase 
"Occupation Tax" on them fits the name given to the 
Illinois 1933 effort to initiate a tax on general sales of 
merchandise, but otherwise there has been nothing else 
to go on. 

Even with Sandstrom’s letter, I remain unconvinced 
that this should be called a new find sales tax token. 
The trouble is, the date of the letter is 1938, by which 
time the local tokens supposedly had been out circula¬ 
tion for three to five years. Further, the state alumi¬ 
num tokens replaced everything in 1935, and they too 
almost immediately had fallen into disuse by late 1936. 

I am doubtful that a national organization as wide¬ 
spread as Woolworth’s would have been allowing one 
of its stores to continue using this bit of paper in 1938. 

The problem presented by this token is not so readily 
resolved, however. The 1933 "Occupation Tax," with 
its accompanying local metal and cardboard tokens, 
was the focus of a legal flurry for about a month in the 
spring of 1933, i.e., April and May. The letter is 
dated April 21, 1938, five years later. Is it possible 
Sandstrom made a dating error when he wrote his 
address and the date? I doubt it, and think we should 
accept the date of the letter as is. 

But , the author goes on to say "used in a small town 
in the southern part of the state." Unfortunately, 
there’s no verb form such as "had been used in . . 
or "is being used in . . ." So we cannot be certain of 
the calendar time of the usage, on that basis alone. 
However, in the next paragraph the author says "It is 
the only Woolworth store using them as far as I can 
learn . . .," which definitely is a now (at the date he 
was writing) time. He also indicates that he had 
investigated at that time and found no usage by other 
stores. Again, there is no "had been" ox other indica¬ 
tion that it was a usage that had been ended. Rather, 


the impression is that usage was continuing into 1938 
for some reason unknown to us. It could have been 
used also during the short period in 1933, but nothing 
in the letter so indicates. 

On the other hand, in 1933 the Kewanee plan, which 
was the most prevalent, dealt with a 3% occupation 
tax (the value stated on the chit), bracketed so that 1C 
tax was to be collected for 27 to 35C. That is the 
collection value or bracket stated on the token for lc. 
The token doesn’t have the format used by other 
cardboard and paper issuers throughout the state, most 
of which used a 14 C value and did not include brackets 
but rather just gave a face value. But there are a 
couple others used in 1933 that do not conform to the 
general pattern, so that probably proves nothing. 

Then also there is the strong possibility that the author 
may have not been as precise as we would like in his 
inquiries about usage or about interpretation of the 
results. He could have thought that he found it "was 
being used" by the store, with the source of the 
information meaning "it had been in use" (i.e. only at 
some time in the past), but Sandstrom understood the 
information as including both past and present usage. 

Isn’t the English language fun? 

It seems to me that at this point we should stay with 
that old rule of thumb: the simplest explanation is the 
best explanation. In other words, Sandstrom meant it 
exactly as he said - he understood that the token was 
currently (1938) in use in some unidentified southern 
Illinois Woolworth store. Since that doesn’t seem to 
fit at all with all the other information we have in hand 
about Illinois tokens, I am inclined to consider the chit 
as a "maybe." 

On the other hand, the letter accompanying it provides 
enough possibility that I wouldn’t advise a collector to 
"forget it." Personally, I’d hold on to the letter and 
the chit as a "puzzle to be solved." As you know, 
about once a year I write a column about such puzzles, 
so now we have another "What about this?" 


So, my fellow collectors of sales tax tokens, what do you think this bit of paper is?

WALTER J. BURKE, JR. 

Merlin K. Maiehorn, L-279 


In Chits, Chiselers, and Funny Money, Pfeffer- 
korn and Schimmel, 1977, Appendix XI, "Other Tax- 
Related Tokens," there is an entry describing a thin- 
wood piece of wooden money, 89 x 51 mm., created 
by Walter J. Burke, Jr in 1970. I repeated this entry 
in our 1993 catalog, on page 360, but assigned no 
catalog number. The 1993 entry was made as an 
informational matter. Mr. Burke created several such 
pieces, not all of which involved sales tax tokens. The 
general format was that there would be a token or coin 
pasted in the center of the wooden piece, and sur¬ 
rounding it would be a "good for one token handshake 
at (a coin-related event)." Aside from several coins 
for various events, he had pasted in the center MO 
zincs, green and red MO plastics, and an IL alumi¬ 
num. Since the usage seemed not specific to tax 
tokens, these pieces were regarded as curiosities rather 
than something to be cataloged, although of course 
every collector is free to do whatever he or she may 
wish. 


I know thai he has known Mike PMierkoni 
and Jerry Schimmel for some time, as well as the late 
Jerry Bates, so I expect that he has a deep pool of 
information that we have not yet tapped, and may have 
some of the Missouri patterns of which we have 
illustrations in the catalog. But, other than some other 
miscellanous information and some pictures that I had 
accumulated, I had not had any more contact with or 
detailed information from him. I recently received a 
note from him, asking for information about the 
Missouri milktop counterstamps. As you are aware, 
there are quite a few of them in the catalog, and there 
are also a couple Catalog Supplement Sheets. He 



indicated he is working on a book about the milktops. 
Such a book would be a nice companion to the cata¬ 
log, in my opinion, so I gladly sent him the requested 
information and asked what else he may have in which 
we might be interested. 

In the short period of our exchanges of corre¬ 
spondence, he sent me xeroxes of several additional 
varieties of the postal card in WA 020, with scenes 
around the state. The gist of the matter is that there 
are at least six more scenic views. These may not be 
of interest to you as collectibles, but I will put them 
into Supplement Sheet form later so that you can stick 
them in your catalog or file if you wish. 

Of more immediate interest, though, was his 
introduction of several more MO counterstamps on the 
five mill and one mill milktops. I will prepare those 
as Catalog Supplement Sheets later. In the meantime, 
here are a few of them. As you are all well aware, 
one of my favorite little hangups is trying to dig out of 
archives, antique.*, and personal rues aii die MO 
counterstamps that I can. 

However, in his notes to me he also indicates 
he has still other MO milktop counterstamps in his 
collection but does not have time to work on the 
matter at the moment because he has been involved 
and occasionally hospitalized with some heart prob¬ 
lems. I am not certain of his current condition - we 
quickly exchanged a couple letters and he commented 
about having more operations coming. I have not 
heard from him since mid-April; hopefully everything 
will be OK and we will be able to explore in more 
detail what information he may have.

PERSONAL NOTES 
and Other Stuff! 

. . . The (Almost Retired) Editor 


THIS IS IT! 


Well, here we are! I’ve been your Editor 
since mid-1985. It has been a lot of fun. There have 
been and still are a lot of interesting things to work on 
and things to be discovered (see my article on Mr. 
Burke, for example), and articles to be written. I’ve 
made my share of serious mistakes as well as silly 
ones, especially silly when it comes to poor proofread¬ 
ing even with computer assistance. You’ve all been 
very kind and understanding, which is always greatly 
appreciated by all of us who volunteer for unpaid jobs 
in all sorts of hobby, church, community service, and 
other organizations. I look forward to being with you 
as a contributor for a while, particularly with regard to 
new finds and continuing efforts to keep the catalog up 
to date. 


I’ve transferred most of the editor’s files to 
Marc Duvall, the new editor, and will be getting die 

remainder into the mail to him within a few weeks. 
I’ve sent some of the secretary-treasurer stuff to Carl 
Cochrane and will get that wrapped up in a month or 
two. 


Frankly, although I’d enjoy continuing as 
editor, I really do think it’s time for a change, a new 
look. Although there are usually only a little over 100 
of us members, each of us has personal interests, so 
it’s really desirable that there be turnover in the editor 
function. That’s gives a better chance for each of us 
to get a fair shake at seeing something related to 
personal interests. So, I move on to spread myself a 
little differently, but am not going to go away by any 
means. 


On a continuing personal note, the cancer has 
again reached the point of needing to be treated, so I 
recently started the second series. This time it’s 
mostly pills instead of shots, but our tactic is not so 
much to reduce the cancer with toxic chemicals that 
will make me terribly sick, but rather to keep it from 
growing too fast by using a treatment that won’t make 
me real sick. In other words, it won’t go away, so 
let’s at least have a reasonable quality of life for a 


little longer. So it looks like this is just the right time 
for a turnover to Marc. Things do work out for the 
best, although sometimes it may not seem that way! 

SOME PERSONAL CURIOSITIES 


Although I don’t spend much time on them, I 
have a couple personal curiosities about tokens. I 
don’t expect to find out much more, but they are 
"What are these all about?" subjects. 

For example, I would like to know more about 
"individual drinking cup" metal tokens. I’ve had a 
couple advertisements on the street in various publica¬ 
tions, but have had very little response. I have 
identified seven so far, four of which are in Schenk- 
man’s catalog of Maryland tokens, from Baltimore. 
One of the Baltimores and one each from Miami, 
Penn. Railroad, and New York City apparently were 
struck by the Individual Drinking Cup Co. of New 
York. But all seven are 23 mm., brass, which makes 
me wonder if the New York Co. didn’t strike them all. 
I’ve also run into a Centadrink brass token from New 
York. About three or four times a year I see a 
drinking cup token in a mail bid sale. But I’d like to 
know more. Why, when, where, etc. I doubt it’d 
ever be more than a short column, maybe in TAMS 
Journal if I ever got enough info together, but at the 
moment it’s just a "curiosity" thing. 

Another curiosity is war tax tokens. They 
were mentioned in Chits and I’ve seen them mentioned 
once in a while in mail bid sales and state catalogs. I 
listed and illustrated a few in Loners (1994), as well as 
occasionally in ATTS Newsletter. But I have the same 
sort of questions. Why, when, who, etc. Again, just 
a curiosity thing that probably doesn’t go anywhere. 
But it’s another one of the odd little corners of token¬ 
collecting that can turn out to be fascinating if you let 
it. 


In fact, it was curiosity about a couple NM 
sales tax tokens that got me started in ATTS in 1983. 
But that’s an old story and doesn’t bear repeating.

DONATIONS: Members have been generous this 
year in sweetening the pot when they have paid their 
dues; the total is $153. Obviously this has aided us 
greatly in keeping our balance positive. Several years 
ago the dues were raised from $5 to $8 by the Board 
because, even with our history of donations, it did not 
look as though we could keep breaking even unless we

The balance ($679.08) for June does not include 
the cost of printing and mailing this issue (#97), which 
is always the case, because the cost is unknown until 
after the issue is printed and mailed. However, what 
this boils down to is that we have $679.08 on which 
to handle misc. secretarial and editorial functions, 
including the Newsletter, for the remainder of fiscal 
year 1997. Remember that we also have $1403.15 
plus accrued interest in our savings account, of which 
the President has custody. 


cut down on editions or otherwise reduced costs. At 
present, it appears we are in good shape and, unless 
there is some horrific change in the economy or how 
we spend our money, we can manage to keep going 
"as is." But keep in mind, we can’t do it without the 
donations. And don’t forget postal costs will go up 
next year probably.

Mr. Henry Morgenthau 
Secretary of the Treasury 
Washington, D, C. 


Dear Mr. Morgenthau: 


We are engaged in the consideration of a problem in 
which we believe that a satisfactory solution is more 
likely to be reached if it is made the subject of frie ndl y 
conference and close cooperation between the states and 
the federal government. Since your attitude as Secretary 
of the Treasury has alr&yc citei^c e&rXi.ed by helpful¬ 

ness and courtesy to state officials, we are writing to 
you in this connection. 


Attached to this letter i3 a copy of an article 
clipped from last evening's Chicago Daily News, which re¬ 
lates to a study upon which the Council is engaged, con¬ 
cerning tax tokens. 

It is obvious that something must be done to secure 
standardization and interchangeability of tax tokens in the 
various states, and that prompt action is necessary before 
the country is flooded with hundreds of millions of diverse 
tokens. 


May we enquire whether our understanding is correct on 
these points: 

1. That the Treasury Department recently considered 
the advisability of the issuance of tax tokens by the 
federal government, and decided against taking such action 
at the time. 

2. That the Treasury Department has expressed an 
opinion that tax tokens are money and that theoretically it 
is unconstitutional for the states to coin them. 


( 1 ). 




* 


( 2 ). 



* 



3. That the Treasury Department concluded that 
inasmuch as the federal government was not prepared to 
issue such tokens, it would not raise constitutional ob¬ 
jections if individual states desired to do so, provided 
that the state tokens were in such form that they would 
not he confused.with the regular currency of the nation. 

That the Treasury Department is not objecting 
to the issuance of square tokens, but is opposed to the 
issuance of round tokens by the states. 

' ' We shall appreciate it very much if you can enclose 
with your answer copies of any departmental opinions or 
rules concerning this subject, whether promulgated by 

yourself, or by the Attorney General, or by the Director 
of the Mint. 


If we are correct in understanding that the Treasury 
Department recently decided against the federal issuance 
tokens at the present time, may we enquire what 
codsidei-uviojia out tied into fcUut decision, and whether the 
decision as to the coming year should be considered tenta¬ 
tive or definite. We believe that this information will be 
helpful to the states in making their plans intelligently, 
and in avoiding the risk of any unnecessarv waste or con¬ 
fusion. 


We are in correspondence with various state officials 
concerning this problem, and we are sending to them a copy 
of this letter in order that they may be informed as to the 
progress of the study upon which we are engaged in their be¬ 
half . If you Will permit me to do so, we shall also send 
them copies of your answer, in order that they may be fully 
advised. 

I am also sending copies of this inquiry to General 
Cummings and to Mrs. Boss. 

With kindest personal regards,

A DEFINITE MAYBE?? - 

IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A MISTAKE, MAKE A BIG ONE! 

. . . Merlin K. Malehom 


One of the things I’ve learned over and over 
(mainly because I keep forgetting, somehow) is to "do 
your homework." This time, I didn’t, and now I wish 
I had a hole to hide in. 

You’ll remember, I hope, that in the last issue. 
Newsletter 97 ,1 had included a two-page article about 
a paper token, with an accompanying letter, that 
George Magee, Jr., had sent down for my so-called 
"expert" opinion. Well, forget the "expert." 

In the letter, dated 1938, a gentleman from 
Illinois had sent to Mr. Magee the paper token, in 
essence saying that it was in use in a town in southern 
Illinois by a Woolworth store. I wrote in response 
that I was somehow doubtful that it could be consid¬ 
ered a sales tax token, mostly because of the late date 
of the letter as related to the dates during which the 
local and state issued tokens were accepted and used in 
the state. 

Here’s what the token looks like. . . 

RETAILERS’ OCCUPATIO 
ONE CENT PAID- 

entitles bearer, to purchase a total of 

35c in merchandise in this store with¬ 
out additional cost. .•«* 'gtj- 

F. W. WOOLWCpWr^CQ^ 1 

iT- 5 ♦ 5 ♦ 

| ILL. > 


OK, so what, you say? Well, this is where I 
really goofed. 

If you have the M&D catalog, take a look at 
the token attributed to Cairo, Illinois, on page 63. 
Same token, right? The Cairo attribution, as noted in 
the catalog, was assigned by Rowold, and we assume 
he was correct. So the token about which I was 
dubious was, in fact, presumably from Cairo, regard¬ 
less of the 1938 date on the letter that came to Mr. 
Magee. The token sent along by Mr. Magee, with the 
letter, for my "expert opinion" is from Cairo and it is 
accepted by us as a sales tax token. 

How could I have made such a stupid mistake 
and failed to find it already in the catalog? I have no 
idea other than a failure to do a proper job of looking 
through the catalog for comparisons, etc. In other 
words, a failure to do my homework completely. I 
got so interested in evaluating the letter and its ramifi¬ 
cations that I didn’t give proper attention to the token 
itself. 

My apologies to Mr. Magee and to any 
members who have been misled by my comments in 
the article in Newsletter 97. 

All I can say is that I really feel "stupid." I 
surely hope no one’s collection has been hurt by this 
big mistake. At this point, I’ll keep trying to not 
make any more of big, dumb, mistakes. But don’t bet 
on it.

by Jerry Schimmel (F-3 , H-7) 

Altvater used to visit here in San Francisco. He lived in 
La. Verne which is somewhere near Los Angeles. If you are from 
San Francisco L.A. County is foreign territory. 

There was a basket in my living room the size of a three gallon 
bucket. I kept it full of state Tax Tokens of all kinds from 
awful condition to BU. if anyone was curious I invited him or 
her to reach in and grab as many as could be held in one hand. 
Ernie visited two or three times. 

He was the first ATTS Newsletter Editor. His father had a print 
shop and the newsletters got done free. Ernie's typesetting made 
trashy articles look like they came out of Time. 

I got started with Sales Tax Tokens like most of us did. I was 
tired of coins. They looked alike and were getting overpriced. 

One day I found a tax token in a junk box and asked what it was. 
Nobody knew. My curiosity got aroused and I was hooked until I 
could find out what they were. 

Jerry Bates in St. Charles, Missouri got me moving on Tax Tokens, 
OPA.booklets, restaruant sugar sacks and things you would not 
believe. That is where I first saw Illinois 1/4 cent tokens for 
sale. When I told him I was starting a catalog on Tax Tokens he 
introduced me to Mike Pfefferkorn who was doing the same. 

About the same time Bates and I agreed that a club was needed. I 
used to sit upstairs in 1971 typing letters to prospective members 
and getting together constitutions, rules, ballots and the like to 
get ATTS off the ground (Twenty-five years ago plus!). Everyone I 
wrote to was ready to go, and they are still going. 

Mike and I had a go-around when he published the Tax T o ken Tally . 
ATTS members were considering what to do for a newsletter and Mike 
thought a private subscription journal would be the thing. Bates 
and I believed the newsletter should stay with the club. Altvater 
stepped in with his press and the rest is history. Mike was a good 
sport and backed out when Ernie's flashy rag went into the mail. 

Somehow Mike and I got together on Chits. C hiselers And Funnv 
_Monoy. Mike did most of the work. I stayed with him once in St. 
Louis when I travelled to Missouri to buy Dick Johnson's 
collection. Missouri in summer is quite an experience if you are 
from naturally air-conditioned Frisco. I slept in the buff every 
night on top of the bed — and it was still too warm! 

Mike is one of the most meticulous numismatists I know. I wish 
he would do more in publishing than the Missouri Numismatic 
journal (which is quite good!). He still cails me long-distance 
from Missouri every now and then just to chat. 


(continued p.5) 



(from p.4) 

George Magee, Jr. was the first to spot Tax Tokens and their 
collectible potential. He published his little booklet in the 
middle 1930s when people still hated the things. I met him in 
the 1970s when he and his wife came to San Francisco on vacation. 
George was already older when I met him. When I heard that he 
was helping Merlin Malehorn and Tim Davenport I was amazed. Emil 
DiBella got more publicity with his checklists than George, 
although I do not think DiBella knew more about sales tax tokens. 

There are others from the first years of ATTS that I remember, 
like George Frakes, who identified the Ristine-Weish token, 
Charles L. Carter, who served as Secretary-Treasurer for years, 
and Tom McMann, who took over the newsletter after I stopped. 
Chuck Lipsky sold me all his Middle West trade tokens and took a 
vacation to the Bahamas on the money. I have not heard from any 
of them or Ernie Altvater for over twenty years. 

Mony oldtimers like Bates and DiBella are gone and there must be 
others I have not heard about. Like Tax Tokens there is no 
shortage of Tax Token collectors. 

Here's to another twenty-five years. 


There will be an informal meeting of ATTS members, and any other 
interested parties, at West Coast Expo's Seattle Coin Show to be 
held at the Seattle International Trade Center at 2601 Elliott 
Ave., Seattle, Washington between 4:00 and 5:00 o'clock p.m. on 
Saturday, October 4, 1997. Other meetings, all on Saturday, are: 

Int'l Association of Silver Art Collectors 10 a.m. — noon 

Anthony Swiatek, "Numismatics 102" noon - 2 p.m. 

Conder Token Collectors Club 2 p.m. - 3 p.m. 

C—4 (Colonial Coin Collectors Club) 3 p.m. -_4 p.m. 

(This schedule is based on the most recent information given to 
Your Editor, it is subject to change.) 

There will be over 200 dealers, some from as far away as.the east 
coast, so it is a show that is well worth attending. Bring your 
copy of this Newsletter, or some other proof of membership in a 
numismatic club to avoid the $3.00 admission charge, which is 
good for all three days (October 3-5). Your Editor hopes that 
someone besides himself is present, and urges any of you in or 
near Seattle at that time to come. 

Your Editor plans to have all who show up examine the color 
plates for the Missouri, Utah, and Washington plastic tokens that 
Merlin has prepared. While Merlin has expressed some dissatis¬ 
faction with them, Your Editor used the plates and found that he 
reattributed some of his pieces (his dictionary defines various 
shades of green as "a shade of green," true, but not very 
useful). There are still problems with reproducing the colors 
accurately, due to technological limitations, which is why Your 
Editor would like to get your imput before we spend money to 
produce color plates. So anyone who can attend is urged to do 
so, and bring your plastic tokens, and anything else you think 
would interest the group.

COMMENTS ON 
TEN INO WOODS 

Marc J. Duvall (L-426) 

I recently acquired two Tenino 
woods which do not match exactly 
any listed in M&D. One is WA-L90, 
except the ink is purple-brown 
rather than red-orange, the other 
is like WA-L86, except "Penney's 
Garage" is 21 mm and the ink blue- 
black-brown rather than blue-green. 
As the "P" in "Penney's" is to the 
left of the upright of the "T" in 
"Tenino," and all varieties of WA- 
L85 and L86 photgraphed in M&D have 
the "P" is to the right of the up¬ 
right of the "T," it appears that 
this may be a fifth variety of this 
merchant. That makes sense as it 
is believed that the Tenino woods 
were printed in multiples of five, 
therefore, each merchant should 
have five (or a multiple of five) 
different printing varieties. 

The ink color varieties may well 
be the result of poor storage, 
both pieces are dark, warped wood 
and have glue spots on the back. 
They were with some common issues 
including some WA state cardboards 
that were in brittle yellow 
plastic. It was so brittle that 
it, and the cardboard token in it, 
shattered when touched. 

The L86 was also on an extremely 
thin planchet, which is why I was 
surprised when I got home to find 
that the front had split from the 
back, I did not think it possible 
to get any thinner. The outsides 
of both front and back have a wood 
grain, but the insides (that were 
attached) are a whitish color 
without a wood grain. The two 
halves are thin enough to see 
light through. As the inner 
surfaces are smooth, it appears 
that the glue holding the token 
together must have entirely dis¬ 
solved, and that the splicewood 
was made by gluing paper to the 
thin layer of wood, and gluing 
two of these together, paper

me try to write an article from them, taking as much (or little) 
credit (or blame) as you want,' you can blame me for any errors in 
spelling, grammar, or anything else you think you can get away with. 
Those of you who actually used the tokens can write what you remem¬ 
ber, and those who did not can try to get the story from someone who 
did. The more stories we can get the better idea we will have of the 
actualuse of the tokens. Of course, anything related to sales tax 
tokens (and my definition thereof will vary depending upon the amount 
of copy I have), as well as constructive criticism, will be appre¬ 
ciated. I want to thank Merlin and Jerry for the articles they sent 
in response to my plea for help (I still have more articles from 
Merlin for future issues), and to Carl for the reports. 

As to my second point, see the related article about the ATTS 
meeting in Seattle on October 4. It cost us nothing to arrange, 
except some of my time, and gives us a chance to get together, and 
maybe even attract some new people to the hobby, especially young 
people. Obviously, most of you will not come to Seattle, so I 
urge you to set up meetings in your local areas. You cannot 
spend any ATTS money without prior written approval of the Board, 
but you should not need to. Let me know and I will put an 
announcement in the Newsletter . I intend to try to have the 
ffewsletter out by April 1, July 1, October 1, and January 1, so 
if you could have all information to me by the first of the 
proceeding month, I would appreciate it. The more people we can 
get into the hobby the better off we all are. 


I am not sure how this issue will look when it gets printed. I am 
still on the.steep part of the learning curve. I. expect the next 
Newsletter will be better. Thank you for your patience and support.

DONATIONS: The donations for this year now total $173. Certainly this has helped us in

lat someone 


besides himself was present, indeed, two thirds of the Seattle mem¬ 
bers showed up (thanks again to Les Albright for keeping me company). 
Token dealer Mike Patton joined as a member after seeing Merlin's 
color plates (they were a big hit with everyone who saw them). Two 
other dealers bought $14.00 in publications, and ail the free News¬ 
letters disappeared, along with mere applications than the Editor 
can account for. On the whole it was a good show for ATTS, although 
in future, the meeting may be after hours, like dinner at the Mecca 
or Five Point Cafes (still in business at their original locations, 

dealers can attend (they did not want to 


near the show site 

leave the bourse). If anyone has any ideas on this matter, or wants 
me 


:o announce a meeting in their area, please let me know. 


The Editor acquired what appears to be a new variety of the Utah 
Ingwersen box of 1 mill plastic tokens, which will be discussed in a 
future issue. A certain person at the show (and he knows who he is) 
grabbed the better box out from under me, so I expect him to examine 
it and report the results to me. 


Thanks to everyone who sent something for inclusion in the Newslet¬ 
ter . Merlin informs me there are a couple of dozen Catalog Supple¬ 
ment Sheets in the works, and asked to inquire whether the members 
would prefer the Canadian items as a booklet or individual sheets? 





NEW FINDS, PERSONAL NOTES 
and Other Stuff! 

Merlin K. Malehorn L-279 

There’s not a lot to report this time, but I 

fortunately Larry Freeman (Parma, OH) sent me a bit 
of information and some pictures that are related to the 
general matter of taxes. 

Around the turn of this century, in Cleveland, 

OH, Tom L. Johnson served as mayor of the city. He 
was the "father of the Cleveland 30 fare and a ‘hard 
nose’ tax man." Among the various items issued in 
his campaigns were several pinbacks. Pictures are 
provided below. All are Navy blue with white print.

In addition, Larry sent pictures of a medal that 
was struck to honor Johnson and, in a sense, his friend 
and right hand man, Henry George, his advisor on 
political and tax matters. George was an economist 
who attracted considerable attention with his book 
Progress and Poverty, which presented the idea of 
having only one tax, which would be on land. The 
medal was struck by George’s son about 1910. The 
pictures are reproduced across the way - my apologies 
for the quality, but that’s the best I could do.

Save Your Confederate Money, Boys, 
The South Will Rise Again! 

Sample — From the office of 

G. H. Bates, State Treasurer 

l Jefferson City, Missouri 



Mike Pfefferkorn sent an item to Merlin who forwarded it to me- As 
you can see from the illustrations it is a paper note with a state¬ 
ment from G.H. Bates, who was a State Treasurer of Missouri while 
STTs were in use there. The reverse is a poor copy of the obverse 
of Criswell f s T-65 (the photocopy of it that is the source of the 
copy in the Newsletter actually came out clearer than the original, 
but I am not sure how good a copy will appear in the Newsletter). 

The two sides are aligned top to top (tt)- The note is printed in 
green ink, probably on newsprint (or something similar), which may 
account for the poor quality of the reverse. The paper also has a 

tint to it, like old newspaper- If anyone can add any inform- 


rown 


:c it 

.ease send it to me and I will include it in 


future issue, 




Thank You, Merlin! 

While it’s great to see new blood at the helm of the venerable ATTS Newsletter , I’d like to take 
a moment to add my voice to the chorus of appreciative comments directed to Merlin Malehorn. 
Without Merlin’s dedication and effort, there is absolutely no doubt that this organization would 
have died in the 1980s. No M&D catalog would exist. The small facet of the numismatic and 
social history of the United States that we all love would be much poorer without Merlin’s 
unshakable commitment over an extremely long period of time. Thank you very much, Merl, for 
all you have done for this organization and for numismatic science! 

Seeingjerry Schimmel’s recollections in issue 98 have inspired me to blabber a bit, I hope you 
will indulge me. I got into sales tax token collecting because of Jerry, more or less. It was 1977 
and I was a 16 year old paper boy who collected coins, went to coin club every month, all that 
good stuff. Junk boxes and kids are made for one another and one day when I was perusing the 
box of dreck at the local coin shop in my hometown of Eureka, California, I blundered upon a few 
tax tokens. They looked like coins but had the name of states on them. How strange! What were 
they? 

I bought a few, searched other junk boxes in other towns and at coin shows. Pretty soon I had 
a rudimentary collection of 25 or 30 common tokens and had begun to grasp their function. I 
made a display for the local coin show, BSed like a champ, and wound up with a Best of Show 
trophy. I was hooked! The process of discovery, of hunting and collecting without Redbooks and 
Bluebooks and nine grades of condition, was very exhilarating. Coin collecting seemed so superficial 
and commercial compared to this tracking and killing of unknown beasts. How many were there? 
Was there any solid information on them? 

As a loyal Coin World and Numismatic News reader, I soon came across Jerry Schimmel’s ads for 
his new catalog, Chits, Chiselers, and Funny Money. Actually, it was Mike Pfefferkorn who ran the 
ads, I’m misremembering things, it seems. But there is no doubt that the catalog lead me to 
Jerry’s tax token sales lists and ATTS. All those tokens to find, that was incomprehensible! It was 
so fun to build the collection. Who knows, someday maybe I’ll start all over again! That was a 
good time in my life. 

I came into ATTS as it was entering its final death throes. Before Merlin saved ATTS, I saved 
it—and I can only hope that new editor Duvall saves it again... The newsletter had passed into the 
hands of one Tom McMann, a good enough guy but one who was really unsuited in an editorial 
capacity in terms of basic literacy and ability to do layout. He was a truly fanatic collector, one of 
the unsung brilliant minds in tax token history. Tom lived and breathed tax tokens, there are only 
a handful of people since their inception who have been as devoted and insightful. Tom and I 
spent hours and hours on the telephone discussing theories about tax tokens—which ones were 
rarer than previously believed, trivial details about their history. As he was clearly ready to cease 
newsletter publication, I almost instantly took over the editorial role, before later dropping the 
ball myself. The amount of work that goes into newsletter preparation is substantial and 
procrastination is quite simple really. 

Merlin joining the organization somehow motivated me to crank out another issue or two, 
after my long pause. I’m not sure what he did or said got me rolling again, maybe it was just the 
fact that a person was excited to join a nearly defunct organization that guilt-tripped me into 
resuming publication. I remember very distinctly that this man joining ATTS coincided almost 
exactly with my resumption of the task I had sorely neglected. After an issue or three, I really don’t 
recall how many, Merlin took over for me as Editor and I blundered along as Secretary-Treasurer 
for a bit. The two jobs are not in any way comparable, incidentally, all praise to the newsletter 
editor! 

We re-wrote the basic catalog of tax token collecting, a long-term goal of mine. While I have 


4 



certain problems with the format of the M&D catalog, that was Merl’s department. I’m sure he 
has certain quibbles with the historical writings, that was my department. We worked fairly well 
together, I think. The inescapable fact is that it was Merlin’s sheer force of will, his dedication to 
the task at hand (and his scamming of free xerox copies from his work!) that made the book 
possible. I merely reorganized and rewrote the existing historical literature and chimed in my two 
bits worth on questions of format. Merlin Malehorn created that book. 

The very best to you, Merl! 

These days my hobby life is completely occupied by a record label I have started called Mutant 
Pop. I can t begin to describe how fun and fulfilling it is for me to play an active roll in the 
creation of the white urban blues music that I love, punk rock. I’ve got 26 singles out (vinyl is not 
dead, punk labels still make records and punk kids buy them and collect them!) and 5 CDs since I 
started the label in 1995. I ve got 9 more singles and 4 more CDs in the works as of this writing. 
My market is small, the economics are basically break-even, and I am loving every minute of it! I 
can t imagine a return to numismatics at this point of my life, I’m having too much fun and 
spending too much money, which is what collecting should be about! 

I do enjoy receiving the newsletter though, it’s a part of my life that I will never forget. Not 
wanting to be a drain on the organization’s financial resources, I’m gonna send $50 to Secretary- 
Treasurer Cochrane today, and I challenge all ATTS Honorary Members to do the same. Come 
on, guys, you can afford it! And that goes for all you Life Members who bought in 20 years ago for 
20 bucks, as well... You ve got your money’s worth, time to reach for the wallet again... 

I ve blabbered enough. Everybody get off your butts and do some research, the microfilm is 
out there in libraries and state government archives around the country. Basic research in the tax 
token states remains to be done. Tax token collecting is an interactive process, that’s part of what 
makes it special. \ ou 11 never understand until you really get involved, so do it today and I’ll enjoy 
reading about it in a couple months. 

Writing this has bi ought back many pleasant memories. The very best to all of you!

Merlin K. Malehorn, 6837 Murray Lane, Annandale 
VA 22003. 


NEED INFORMATION: I have two tokens from 
Ohio about which I would like to know more, if any 
members can provide information. They are both 
aluminum, 38 mm, holed at 90 and 360. One is dated 
1956, the other 1957. The obverse inscriptions are 
TRAILER TAX / (Ohio state seal) / (year) / OHIO. 
The reverses are blank. The person from whom I 
obtained them stated that they were used for "several" 
years during the 1950s, for payment of taxes on house 
trailers. They would be wired to the tongues of the 
trailers as visible receipts for county auditors. I am 
curious about whether there were other years, different 
designs, or any other information that might be 
known. Jay A. Harris, 7105 Mildon Drive, Paines-
