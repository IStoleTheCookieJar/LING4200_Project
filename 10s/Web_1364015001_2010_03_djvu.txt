Summary 


About this Release 


The Treasury Macro-Economic (TRYM) model of the Australian economy has been 
developed and is used within the Commonwealth Treasury of Australia. The TRYM model 
was designed to assist in policy analysis and forecasting at the macro-economic level. The 
result is a model that is ideal for understanding the workings of the Australian economy and 
for economic research and analysis. The database is separately available as part of the 
Modellers' Database (cat. no. 1364.0.15.003). The TSP version of TRYM allows users to 
access individual equations and comes with a user guide for using TRYM in TSP. Users will 
need a copy of TSP Version 5.0 to run this version of the Model. 


User should note that the TRYM model is presently undergoing a major redevelopment. The 
aim is to improve the model structurally and to update the operating environment of TRYM 
from TSP to EViews 7. Due to the change, the TSP release of TRYM will be discontinued 
with the roll-out of the EViews-based model. This is scheduled to occur in early 2011. 


To subscribe to the TRYM model, please phone the Database Manager (02) 6252 7037.
