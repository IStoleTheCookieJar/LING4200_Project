As  1 strolled  towards  the  main 
door  of  Wallace  Hall,  I could 
not  help  being  reminded  of 
George  Cooper’s  “October’s 
Party.’’  The  leaves  by  hun- 
dreds did  come,  and  the  per- 
fect scene  was  set  for  an  event 
of  voluminous  proportions, 
namely,  the  Fine  Arts  Club’s 
presentation  of  “Bachelors  of 
Art”,  MBA’s  first  talent  show 
since  1974.  I came  prepared 
for  a magnificent  display  of 
talent  and  received  just  that. 

Throughout  the  school 
year,  the  Fine  Arts  Club,  with 
the  incessant  aid  of  Mrs. 
Christeson,  has  prepared  and 


promoted  the  idea  of  a talent 
show  at  MBA,  and  it  was  due 
specifically  to  their  efforts 
that  the  first  talent  show  in 
fifteen  years  came  off  as  such 
a success. 

The  professionalism  of 
the  backstage  crew  of  Pieter 
Foster,  Steve  Anderson,  and 
Asher  Dudley  kept  the  show 
running  smoothly;  while  the 
acts  themselves  provided  the 
large  crowd  of  faculty,  par- 
ents, and  students  with  a great 
Sunday  afternoon. 

The  Judges  were  Judy 
McCord  from  the  Circle 
Theater  and  Belmont  Col- 
lege, Trish  Woolwine,  wife  of 
Skip  Woolwine  (a.k.a.  Dave

Letterman),  and  Martha 
Goodman  from  the  Academy 
Theater. 

The  actual  setup  of  the 
stage  was  based  on  that  of 
Late  Night  with  David  Letter- 
man  with  Skip  Woolwine,  a 
former  MBA  graduate,  as 
Dave  and  the  ever-present 
Mauro  Mastrapasqua  as  Paul 
Schaefer. 

A plethora  of  talented 
personages,  however,  was 
what  the  show  was  really 
about,  and  with  actors,  guitar- 
ists, pianists,  and  a mime,  the 
entertainment  was  non-stop. 

The  performers  were 
Dan  Brooks  and  Lee  Page  on 
bass  and  6-string,  respec- 
tively; Matt  Foster,  a mime; 
Mauro  Mastrapa.squa  on  pi- 
ano; James  Nash  on  guitar; 
Andrew  Duthie  on  B-flal 
clarinet;  Rob  Lentz,  Lee 
Page,  Carter  McNabb,  and 
Alden  Smith  with  a brilliant 
performance  of  “Count 
Floyd’s  Scary  Stories;”  Si- 
mon Westlake  and  Eric  Falk 
with  a Vietnam  war  drama. 
“A  Death  in  the  Family;” 
Chris  Tapia  singing  Billy 
Joel’s  “Just  the  Way  You

Victor  Borge  (a.k.a.  Dr. 
Paschall)  with  a tantalizing 
display  of  piano  keyboard 
knowledge  as  well  as  a thor- 
ough examination  of  “Mary 
Had  a Little  Lamb."  (Larry 
Vranka  was  scheduled  to 
appear,  but  he  was  rehabili- 
tating at  the  time. 

Dan  Brooks  and  Lee 
Page  with  their  original  guitar 
tune  excited  the  crowd  and 
finished  third,  sharing  the  25 
dollar  prize.  Matt 
Foster  displayed 
the  aging  of  a man 
and  silently  ac- 
cepted 50  dollars 
for  his  second 
place  finish.  Fi- 
nally, Mauro 
Mastrapasqua. 
president  of  the 
Fine  Arts  Club, 
brought  the  house 
down  with  his 
mastery  of  the 
piano  when  he 
performed 
Brahms’  “Capric- 
cio”  and  brought 
home  1(X)  dollars 
for  a first  place 
finish. 

Skip 
Woolwine  tried 
hard  not  to  steal 
the  show  but  often 


did  with  such  “Top  Ten” 
items  as  Rambo  librarians 
from  Hell.  History  Room  rug 
rolling.  Mrs.  Simmons’  sing- 
ing “Pennies  from  Heaven.” 
and  Dr.  Paschall’s  laughing 
uncontrollably  in  assembly. 

I believe  that  Mrs.  Chris- 
teson summed  up  the  talent 
show  best  when  she  said  that 
“...it’s  a wonderful  chance  for 
the  boys  to  showcase  their 
abilities  to  the  school...  I hope 
it  starts  a new  trend.” 


Recycling  Program  Commences  on  the  Hill 


by  Rob  Lentz 

writer 


With  all  the  recent  problems 
that  have  been  bothering  this 
community  concerning  gar- 
bage, it  has  become  apparent 
that  recycling  refuse  is  the 
wave  of  the  future.  Indeed, 
the  picturesque  Bordeaux 
landfill  is  at  this  very  moment 
piling  up  to  its  grimy  brim 
with  the  filth,  muck,  and  dis- 
carded waste  of  our  dispos- 
able Middle  Tennessee  soci- 
ety. This  problem  exists  sim- 
ply because  no  community 
with  running  water  is  willing 
to  have  Nashville’s  trash  bur- 
ied in  its  backyard. 

Meanwhile,  prudent  and 


spendthrifty  Mayor  Boner 
has  cut  back  on  funds  for  gar- 
bage col  lection,  leaving  much 
of  our  fair  city  with  bulging 
trash  cans  on  our  comers, 
susceptible  to  the  whims  of 
hungry  wtwdland  creatures 
and  thrill-seeking  teenaged 
drivers.  Well,  in  view  of  the 
substantial  problems  of  waste 
management,  recycling  has 
become  a practical  and  even 
profitable  solution  to  dump- 
ing trash  into  a hole  into  the 
ground. 

Recycling  puts  discarded 
waste  material  to  good  use: 
most  any  type  of  paper  or 
cardboard,  aluminum  cans, 
glass  of  all  kinds  and  colors. 


even  plastic  bottles  and  con- 
tainers can  recycled  and  con- 
verted into  u.seful  materials, 
products  that  save  innocent 
trees  and  a great  deal  of  ex- 
pense for  manufacturers,  and 
reduce  our  own  burden  of 
garbage. 

Why,  even  here  on  the 
campus  of  Montgomery  Bell 
Academy,  we  have  aspired  to 
strike  a blow  in  the  direction 
of  recycling  the  refuse  of  the 
world.  Acting  upon  the  sug- 
gestions of  Mr.  Moxley  and  in 
the  spirit  of  the  fine  work  of 
the  Junior  class  in  its  attempts 
to  recycle  aluminum  cans,  the 
Student  Council  under  Alden 
Smith  has  authorized  the 


placement  of  cardboard 
boxes  in  strategic  locations 
around  the  MBA  campus. 
These  boxes  are  to  serve  as 
receptacles  for  any  unwanted 
non-waxed  paper  items  (e.g., 
notebook  paper,  computer 
paper,  discarded  lunch  bags, 
etc.),  which  will  then  be  col- 
lected and  recycled,  reaping 
great  profits  for  the  school, 
the  environment,  and  the 
world. 

Student  Council  presi- 
dent Alden  Smith  told  The 
Bell  Ringer.  “The  guys  up 
front  really  played  well.  Our 
offense  was  struggling,  but 
the  defense  really  came 
through  for  us.  What  was  the 


question?”  Of  the  recycling 
project.  Smith  said,  “It  has  the 
potential  to  be  worthwhile, 
but  only  if  each  individual 
contributes  to  the  effort.  Indi- 
viduals make  up  the  whole,  as 
you  know,” 

This  small  step  may  seem 
insignificant  to  the  careless 
student/casual  paper  dis- 
carder.  but  it  is  an  important 
step  in  the  awareness  of  a 
major  modem  environmental 
problem  and  what  can  be  done 
about  it  by  us.  Hopefully,  the 
school's  recycling  project  is 
only  the  beginning  of  its  con- 
cern for  the  future  of  the  envi-

Flag  Burning  - Constitutional  Right  or  Crime? 


Flag  Burning  is  a Constitutional  Right 


by  David  Lott 

Cop\  Editor 


Flag  Burning  is  a Crime 


by  Alex  Rogers 

writer 


The  decision  rests  on  the  fact 
that  flag  desecration  is  pro- 
tected by  the  First  Amend- 
ment as  a form  of  symbolic 
speech. 

Justice  William  Brennan 
stated  that  “we  do  not  conse- 
crate the  flag  by  punishing  its 
desecration,  for  in  doing  so 
we  dilute  the  freedom  that  this 
cherished  emblem  repre- 
sents.” and  that  “our  decision 
is  a re-affirmation  of  the  prin- 
ciples of  freedom  and  inclu- 
siveness that  the  flag  best  re- 
flects.” 

Thus  the  burning  of  the 
flag  may  be  interpreted  as  a 
patriotic  demonstration  of 
man’s  rights,  although  it  is 
unlikely  that  a patriotic 
American  would  bum  a flag; 
conservative  Justice  Anthony 
Kennedy  reluctantly  re- 
marked. however,  that  “it  is 
poignant  but  fundamental 
that  the  flag  protects  those 
who  hold  it  in  contempt.” 


Perhaps  the  ruling  would 
have  been  different  if  flag 
burning  could  be  shown  to 
infringe  upon  the  rights  of 
other  people.  Chief  Justice 
William  Rehnquist  stated. 
“Surely  one  of  the  high  pur- 
poses of  a democratic  society 
is  to  legislate  against  conduct 
that  is  regarded  as  evil  and 
profoundly  offensive  to  the 
majority  of  p>eople.”  but  Bren- 
nan argued.  “If  there  is  a bed- 
rock principle  underlying  the 
First  Amendment,  it  is  that  the 
Government  may  not  prohibit 
the  expression  of  an  idea 
simply  because  society  finds 
the  idea  itself  offensive  or 
disagreeable.” 

The  American  flag  be- 
longs to  all  Americans,  but 
the  cloth,  paper,  wood.  etc. 
upon  which  the  flag  is  printed 
is  private  property  and  subject 
to  the  owner's  whims.  Does 
the  desecration  of  the  flag  by 
one  man  infringe  upon  the 
rights  of  another?  I do  not 
think  so. 


George  Bush  is  pushing 
for  an  alteration  to  the  First 
Amendment,  a new  amend- 
ment prohibiting  flag  dese- 
cration. The  consequences  of 
such  an  amendment  are  com- 
plex. What  would  a loyal 
American  do  then  if  his  flag 
accidently  touched  the 
ground?  Should  he  honor  Old 
Glory  by  burning  her  and  risk 
arrest?  What  would  happen  to 
someone  wearing  the  flag 
design  on  clothing?  A new 
amendment  would  need  to 
treat  these  and  similar  situ- 
ations. Such  an  amendment  is 
uncalled-for  and  would 
probably  do  little  to  increase 
the  dying  American  patriot- 
ism. Let  us  therefore  seek  not 
to  withold  the  Constitutional 
rights  of  others,  but  let  us  seek 
rather  to  show  a positive  patri- 
otic support  for  the  Land  of 
the  Free  by  flying  our  own 
Star-spangled  Banners  wave 
with  pride  and  honor. 

{Time,  vol.  1 34.  no.  I . July  3, 
1989) 


An  un-uniformed  man  in 
1 774  raises  a piece  of  red  and 
while  striped  cloth  with  thir- 
teen stars  on  a blue  back- 
ground and  shouts  a battle  cry 
of  freedom.  A redcoat  stand- 
ing twenty  paces  away  fires  a 
musket  and  guns  the  man 
down.  The  un-uniformed 
man  has  died  fighting  for  free- 
dom and  liberty,  and  the  piece 
of  cloth,  the  first  image  of  our 
flag,  was  the  embodiment  of 
the  rebellion. 

We  all  know  that  Amer- 
ica won  its  revolution  and 
adopted  a constitution  and  a 
bill  of  rights.  The  first  amend- 
ment of  the  constitution  states 
that  no  law  shall  be  made  by 
congress  abridging  the  free- 
dom of  speech  or  the  press. 
This  amendment  does  not 
state  that  all  public  expres- 
sions are  legal.  Those  expres- 
sions which  harm  others  are 
expressly  forbidden.  The 
question  remains,  however, 
what  constitutes  harm  to- 


wards others.  Does  the  harm 
have  to  be  slander,  or  can  it 
relate  to  harming  the  image  of 
others  than  the  transgressor. 
This  introduction  leads  into 
the  true  point  of  this  article. 
Should  flag  burning  be  legal? 

In  answer  to  this  question 
I must  answer  with  a 
resounding  NO.  The  first 
point  to  be  made  is  that  flag 
burning  harms  others.  It 
harms  the  image  of  Ameri- 
cans everywhere.  If  flag 
burning  is  legal,  then  all  the 
limes  terrorists  have  burned 
our  flag  as  a symbol  of  their 
hate  for  all  that  the  United 
States  of  America  stand  for 
means  nothing  because  we 
have  demonstrated  by  tolerat- 
ing the  burning  of  our  own 
flag  that  we  care  nothing  for 
our  own  values.  Flag  burning 
also  gives  licence  to  anyone  to 
show  contempt  to  the  U.S.  by 
burning  our  flag.  In  effect, 
this  is  aiding  and  abetting  an 
enemy  of  the  U.S.,  and  ac-

On  Ofiobcr  2}.  Mr.  Drake 

asked  Kevin  Kruse  and  David 
Haslam  into  his  office.  Per- 
haps he  wished  to  congratu- 
late them  on  yet  another  stun- 
ning cheerleading  perform- 
ance or  a great  homecoming 
photography  backdrop,  but  it 
was  something  much  more 
grave. 

Several  weeks  earlier,  en 
route  to  the  Hunter’s  Lane 
football  game,  Kristen 
Knecland,  Kevin  Kruse.  Lee 
Page.  Larry  Vranka.  and 
David  Haslam  ran  into  diffi- 
culties involving  their  exact 
location.  With  Larry’s  pitiful 
navigation,  poor  Kristen 
drove  all  over  Nashville,  des- 
perately searching  for  the 
game.  They  would  be  still 
driving  today  had  they  not 
have  asked  Earl  (of  “Earl’s 
Eats.  Gas.  and  Antiques”)  for 
proper  directions. 

To  make  a long  story 
short  (trite  phrase:  -5).  the 
Accord  packed  full  o’  cheer- 
leaders and  Larry  arrived  at 
the  game  late  in  the  second 


quarter.  Luckily,  both  of  the 
fans  did  not  seem  to  mind 
their  tardiness. 

Toward  the  end  of  the 
victorious  game,  ace  photog- 
rapher and  personal  friend  of 
mine  Pieter  Foster  snapped  a 
picture  to  remember  the 
moment.  Taking  a humorous 
side  to  the  situation  which  had 
just  occurred  previously  to 
the  game  (as  lho.se  zany 
cheerleaders  are  prone  to  do), 
the  guys  (slang:  -5)  pointed  at 
Kristen,  acknowledging  the 
cause  of  their  tardiness. 
(Larry  Vranka.  who  was  the 
true  cause  of  the  disaster,  was 
using  the  public  facilities  and 
was  therefore  not  pictured.) 

Pieter’s  photo  was  pub- 
lished in  The  Bell  Ringer’s 
October  19'*’.  1989  issue  on  the 
back  page.  It  sent  a panic  so 
widespread  that  some  ana- 
lysts in  New  York  feared 
another  slockmarket  crash 
and  subsequent  depression. 
(Hal  Jones  decided  to  stay 
home  sick). 

Friends,  alumni,  teach- 
ers, and  parents  (especially 
Beth  Bather’s),  please  re- 
member that  appearances  can 


deceiving  and  in  this  case  ab- 
solutely false.  The  reprint  of 
the  photograph  is  poor,  and 
with  the  turtlenecks  the  girls 
were  wearing  and  the  flash’s 
reflection  on  all  the  cheer- 
leaders’ skin  being  so  bright, 
the  two  appear  to  merge. 

Believe  me:  I.  an  unbi- 
ased party,  can  honestly 
vouch  for  the  characters  of 
Kevin  and  Dave  (needless  to 
say  of  Beth).  I know  that  they 
would  never  do  anything  so 
vulgar  and  crude  (in  public).  I 
know  David  in  particular.  He 
is  a bright,  upstanding  boy 
gentleman  with  a real  direc- 
tion and  a drive  to  work  hard. 
He  would  make  an  excellent 
addition  to  any  college  or  uni- 
versity he  attends.  Kevin  is 
pretty  good.  too. 

In  conclusion.  I only 
hope  these  fine  gentlemen  can 
ride  out  the  rough  seas  of  the 
.scandalous  spotlight. 

Sincerely. 

A concerned  body  who 
does  not  wish  to  see  rumors

great  guys  Kevin  and  Dave.

Is  Our  Cafeteria 

Overcharging? 


bv  Jason  Rilchuson 


That's  right!  The  cafeteria  at 
our  own  Montgomery  Bell 
Academy  has  been  charging 
us  sixty-five  cents  for  a ten 
ounce  cup  of  Coke,  not  in- 
cluding ice.  This  means  each 
student  who  pays  for  his  bev- 
erage is  getting  approxi- 
mately six  to  eight  fluid 
ounces  of  cola  depending  on 
the  amount  of  ice  he  puts  in 
his  drink. 

The  overall  change  from 
Belle  Meade  Cafeterias  cater- 
ing to  regionally  known  and 
operated  Bonds,  Inc.  food 
corporation  is  that  prices  have 
basically  stayed  the  same. 
However.  Bonds  offers  a 
greater  variety  of  foods  but 
these  varieties  are  not  avail- 
able to  the  public  every  day. 

When  I personally 
brought  the  beverage  prob- 
lem to  the  manager  of  the 
cafeteria,  she  took  it  with 
some  hostility  and  said  that 
the  sixteen  ounce  reading  on 
the  menu  given  to  each  stu- 
dent on  registration  day  was  a 
typographical  error. 

Much  to  her  dismay.  I 
found  that  it  was  not  simply  a 
“typo.”  St.  Cecilia,  whose 
cafeteria  is  also  operated  by 
Bonds,  has  the  same  thing  on 
their  menu.  St.  Cecilia,  how- 
ever, serves  the  sixteen  ounce 
cup. 

“Why  does  MBA  get 
cheated  of  six  fluid  ounces?” 
you  are  asking  yourself.  1 
shall  tell  you  why. 

Last  year,  two  of  our  stu- 
dents raised  the  issue  of  our 
decreasing  ozone  layer.  It  has 
been  proved  that  the  materials 
used  to  make  Styrofoam  are 
one  of  the  contributing  factors 
to  this  disintegration  of  the 
ozone.  John  Henry  Rice  and 
Willie  Johnson  made  a strong 
argument  to  the  school  and 
cafeteria,  and  both  decided  to 


switch  to  paper  cups,  whose 
materials  pose  no  impending 
effects  on  the  ozone  layer  to 
this  day.  The  cost  and  change 
of  the  operation  would  be 
minimal,  so  it  was  ratified. 

As  of  now.  we  are  paying 
one  cent  per  dozen  paper  cups 
bought,  which  is  a twenty- 
four  to  twenty-eight  dollar 
increase  over  the  price  of 
Styrofoam  cups,  which  is 
minimal  in  respect  to  the  total 
gross  for  one  day  of  purchase. 
When  1 asked  another  mem- 
ber of  the  cafeteria  staff  about 
the  problem,  he  said  that  “the 
reason  why  we  charge  more 
for  the  Coke  is  this  price  of  the 
cup.”  So  it  seems  that  both  of 
their  excuses  are  false. 

Another  issue  is  the  right 
for  the  student  to  bring  his 
own  lunch  and/or  Coke  to 
school.  When  I talked  to  Dr. 
Paschall  about  this  problem, 
he  said  that  “We’re  not  going 
to  force  people  to  eat  (the  food 
for  sale]  in  the  lunch  room,” 
which  is  perfectly  correct. 
But  to  those  of  us  who  do  not 
bring  our  own  lunch  and  are 
forced  to  buy  it  at  the  some- 
what monopolized  cafeteria, 
it  seems  to  be  very  unfair. 

Don’t  worry!  The  cafete- 
ria is  not  completely  oblivi- 
ous to  authority.  The  school 
handles  and  agrees  to  changes 
in  the  prices  of  our  cafeteria 
and  our  student  government 
has  a strong  say  so,  too.  As 
Dr.  Paschall  said.  “We’re 
trying  to  make  it  as  conven- 
ient as  possible  for  you  and 
you  have  the  options  [to  bring 
lunches  from  home).” 

1 hope  this  article  points 
out  to  each  student  is  that  if  he 
is  getting  “ripped  off.”  and 
does  like  it,  he  should  let 
someone  know  who  will 
make  a difference.  A com- 
promise in  our  favor  will 
hopefully  prevail  in  the  end.

Leukemia:  Freshman  Bo 

Sundius  is  one  of  the  unsel- 
fish. concerned  individuals 
supporting  this  cau.se. 

Bo  first  became  affiliated 
with  the  Leukemia  Society 
six  years  ago  while  swim- 
ming in  a league.  The  brief 
visit  by  this  Society  immedi- 
ately sparked  the  interest  and 
enthusiasm  of  young  Sun- 
dius. Through  the  years,  as  he 
began  accepting  pledges  for 
swimming  100  laps.  Bo 
learned  more  about  this  usu- 
ally treatable  disea.se  and  how 
it  affects  the  body.  Although 
he  plans  to  own  his  own  busi- 
ness some  day,  this  dedicated 
athlete  intends  to  raise  in  the 
summer  as  much  money 
through  pledges  as  possible  as 
well  as  to  become  an  even 
better,  stronger  swimmer. 


with  more  speed  drawing 
more  funds.  To  date.  Bo 
Sundius  has  amassed  thirty 
thousand  dollars  for  this  spe- 
cial cause. 

His  accomplishments 
have  been  well-noticed  and 
recognized.  The  widely-pub- 
licized Bo  Sundius  Day.  Oc- 
tober 17  of  1988.  was  estab- 
lished on  the  same  date  this 
year.  In  addition  to  this  proc- 
lamation of  Mayor  Bill 
Boner.  Bo  was  honored  by 
Governor  McWherter  with 
Tennessee’s  Outstanding 
Achievement  Award,  an  ac- 
complishment of  which  Bo 
could  be  proud.  This  unique 
freshman  hopes,  moreover, 
that  he  will  be  the  recipient  of 
the  prestigious  “Senior  Na- 
tional Tops,”  an  award  which 
would  guide  him  to  the  col- 
lege of  his  choice  - Stanford. 
His  overall  goal,  however,  is 
to  be  in  the  .same  position  of 
awarding  an  honorable  youth 
as  was  Tracy  Caulkins,  whom 
he  highly  regards  as  “the 
strongest  woman  swimmer  in 
history.” 


Bo’s  own  opinion  of  the 
Leukemia  Society  is  inspiring 
and  suggests  hope  for  con- 
quering this  trauma:  “It  is  a 
great  organization.  First  ifall. 
it  mainly  affects  young  chil- 
dren, the  youth  of  the  nation. 
The  money  1 raise  goes  di- 
rectly to  this  organization 
unlike  other  programs  which 
go  through  different  stages.” 
On  a sad  note,  however.  Bo 
then  related  a tragic  story  of 
an  MBA  graduate  who  re- 
cently passed  away  from  sud- 
den Leukemia  complications. 
Twenty-seven  year  old  Gar- 
rett Fulton  was  a victim  of 
Leukemia  for  three  to  four 
years  and  was  at  one  point 
near  death.  It  was  at  this  point 
when  Garrett  went  into  remis- 
sion. but  the  unpredictable 
disea.se  struck  again  recently, 
this  time  fatally.  It  is  Bo’s 
constant  desire  to  utilize  his 
talents  outside  formal  compe- 
tition which  has  established 
him  as  a “lifeguard,”  an  indi- 
vidual determined  to  save 
lives  like  Garrett’s  when  he  is 
in  the  pool.

NOVEMBER  21,  1989 


World 


by  Brent  Miller 

reporter 


The  Oakland  Athletics 
proved  to  be  the  dominant 
team  of  1989.  After  one  of  the 
greatest  upsets  in  1988  by  the 
Los  Angeles  Dodgers,  the  A *s 
led  by  Rickey  and  Dave  Hen- 
derson crushed  the  San  Fran- 
cisco Giants  in  a four  game 
sweep. 

In  game  one.  Scott  Gar- 
relts  of  the  Giants  faced  Dave 
Stewart  of  the  A's.  Garrelts 
had  an  unimpressive  start 
while  Stewart  overpowered 
the  Giants  to  lead  the  A's  to  a 
5 - 0 victory  while  allowing 
only  5 hits. 

In  game  two.  Rick 
Reuschel  of  the  Giants  saw 
the  likes  of  Mike  Moore  on 
the  mound  for  the  A’s  as  once 
again  the  A’s  triumphed  over 
the  Giants  5 - 1 while  Moore 
allowed  only  4 hits. 

Before  game  three  could 
get  underway  an  earthquake 
measuring  7.0  on  the  Richter 
scale  ripped  through  the  Bay 
Area  leaving  a path  of  de- 
struction in  its  wake.  As  ev- 
eryone realized  the  reality  of 
this  nightmare,  baseball 
Commissioner  Faye  Vincent 
summed  up  the  imponance  of 
the  World  Series  at  this  time 
by  referring  to  it  as  “a  modest 
little  sporting  event.”  The 
Series  was  then  postponed  a 
week  so  the  citizens  of  the 


Series 

Bay  Area  could  rebuild  the 
city  as  well  as  their  lives. 

On  October  27,  with  only 
abt)ul  70  people  of  the  sellout 
crowd  redeeming  their  tickets 
for  the  money  refund,  the 
Series  was  resumed  at  Can- 
dlestick Park  with  Dave  Ste- 
wart facing  Scott  Garrelts, 
again. 

Both  teams  helped  to  set 
a new  record  for  the  most 
home  runs  in  one  game  by 
both  teams  with  7.  The 
members  of  each  team  who 
helped  to  attain  this  record  are 
as  follows:  San  Francisco’s 
Matt  Williams  and  Bill  Bathe, 
who  became  the  twenty-first 
player  to  hit  a home  run  in  his 
first  Series  at-bat;  Oakland’s 
Dave  Henderson  with  two 
homers,  Tony  Phillips,  Jo.se 
Canseco,  who  at  his  previous 
at-bat  had  broken  his  twenty- 
third  consecutive  hitless  Se- 
ries at-bat.  and  Carney 
Landsford. 

As  a result  of  the  exten- 
sive number  of  home  runs  hit 
by  the  A’s.  they  were  the  vic- 
tors. 

The  opening  of  game 
four  saw  Ron  Robinson  on  the 
mound  for  the  first  time  in  this 
Series  because  of  the  unex- 
pected injury  of  Rick 
Reuschel  during  the  Giant’s 
batting  practice,  while  the  A’s 
placed  game  two  winner 
Mike  Moore  on  the  hill.  After

Recap 

a heated  battle,  the  A’s  were 
victorious,  thus  concluding 
their  four  game  sweep  of  the 
San  Francisco  Giants  and 
tagging  them.selves  with  the 
title  the  "best  in  20  years.” 

The  1989  World  Series 
saw  Rickey  Henderson  smash 
several  Series  individual  rec- 
ords for  a four  game  Series 
such  as:  most  stolen  bases  (3), 
most  triples  (2),  and  most  at- 
bats(19).  At  the  same  time 
he,  Dave  Henderson,  and 
Dave  Stewart  compiled  some 
of  the  most  impressive  statis- 
tics of  the  decade.  Rickey 
ended  the  Series  with  9 hits,  1 
double,  2 triples,  1 home  run. 
and  a team-leading  batting 
average  of  .474.  Dave  Hen- 
derson ended  the  Series  with  4 
hits,  2 doubles.  2 home  runs, 
and  a batting  average  of  .308 . 
Dave  Stewart  compiled  sta- 
tistics that  were  so  impressive 
he  received  the  1989  World 
Series  MVP  award.  Dave 
ended  the  Series  with  2 games 
pitched.  2 wins.  0 loses,  14 
strike  outs,  10  hits  allowed,  3 
runs  allowed.  2 walks,  and  an 
earned  run  average  of  1 .69  . 

So  in  the  shadow  of  their 
upset  in  the  1988  World  Se- 
ries, the  Oakland  Athletics 
were  able  to  show  everyone 
that  they  could  escape  adver- 
sity and  have  one  of  the  most 
impressive  Series  showings 
in  baseball  history.

The  Drug  War 

Commentary 


President  Bush  won  many 
supporters  when  he  initially 
presented  his  multi-billion 
dollar  plan  to  attack  the 
nation's  drug  problem  and, 
with  the  advice  of  William 
Bennett,  tried  more  innova- 
tive ways  to  attack  the  prob- 
lem such  as  stiffer  penalties 
for  casual  drug  use  and  boot 
camps  for  the  rehabilitation  of 
young  drug  users.  The  plan 
came  at  a time  when  the  vio- 
lence resulting  from  drug 
gangs  and  the  number  of  hard 
users  are  at  a peak;  it  is  doubt- 
ful. however,  that  the  plan 
will  have  a significant  impact 
on  the  drug  problem. 

One  facet  of  the  program  is 
an  attack  on  the  drug  supply  in 
Peru.  Bolivia,  and  Colombia 
through  interdiction,  eradica- 
tion, and  economic  aid.  Un- 
fortunately, if  past  interdic- 
tion and  eradication  efforts 
are  any  indication,  drug  bar- 
ons will  simply  move  from 
one  place  to  another  as  they 
are  sought  by  the  military. 
This  movement  may  only 
spread  the  drug  trade  to  other 
areas.  In  addition,  these  ef- 
forts have  increased  the  dis- 
content of  peasants  who  de- 
rive their  primary  sources  of 
income  from  the  drug  trade. 
In  a country  such  as  Bolivia, 
where  the  drug  trade  brings  in 
nearly  $400  million  in  reve- 
nue, revolution  would  be  in- 
evitable if  the  drug  supply 
were  actually  lessened.  The 
present  policy  of  the  Bush 
administration  and  Congress, 
though  politically  popular, 
has  failed  to  put  any  dent  in 
the  supply  that  seems  to  grow 
larger  every  year.  During 
recent  drug  raids  by  the  Co- 
lombian government,  success 
has  increased  in  cutting  off 
the  drug  supply  of  cocaine; 
however,  there  have  been 
costs,  with  many  leading 
government  officials  assassi- 
nated by  drug  barons.  Many 
foreign  policy  experts  have 
been  critical  of  the  U.S. 
government’s  lack  of  finan- 
cial support  for  these  coun- 
tries’ search  for  alternative 
crops  and  sources  of  income. 


Unless  the  harsh  economic 
conditions  of  these  countries 
are  mitigated,  a decline  in  the 
drug  trade  is  unlikely.  Geo- 
political interests  must  be 
kept  in  mind  when  encour- 
agement of  military  action  by 
highly  unstable  Latin  Ameri- 
can governments  is  given. 
Bush  and  Congress  seem  to  be 
taking  a step  in  the  right  direc- 
tion with  their  slight  shift  of 
their  focus  of  the  drug  war 
towards  the  demand  side  over 
the  supply  side. 

On  the  demand  side.  Bush 
has  proposed  stiffer  penalties 
for  casual  drug  users  and 
dangerous  drug  dealers:  for 
the  casual  user  there  are  pun- 
ishments such  as  the  loss  of 
driver’s  licences  and  longer 
sentences  for  incarceration; 
and  for  the  youth,  Bennett, 
former  Secretary  of  Educa- 
tion. suggests  reduction  of 
federal  student  loans  and 
mandatory  drug  education  for 
users.  Under  the  plan,  drug 
education  and  treatment  will 
increa.se  with  the  treatment 
focused  on  hard  users.  Ca- 
pacity expansion  of  federal 
prisons  by  15%  will  allow 
Judges  to  incarcerate  the  drug 
dealers  for  greater  peritxls  of 
time,  although  the  deterrence 
value  of  such  primitive  poli- 
cies is  dubious  at  best.  Pris- 
ons may  even  encourage  fur- 
ther recidivism  becau.se  they 
serve  as  schools  of  crime  in 
which  criminals  are  exposed 
to  new  criminal  activities. 
The  positive  aims  of  the  plan 
are  enormously  popular  but 
do  nothing  to  assuage  the 
conditions  that  have  led  to 
drug  use  and  drug  sales.  The 
poverty  of  the  inner  cities  has 
gradually  increased  and  eco- 
nomic opportunities  for 
blacks  remain  in  short  supply. 
Greater  incarceration  may 
only  perpetuate  black  impov- 
erishment that  has  caused 
young  blacks  to  turn  to  drug 
deal  ing  to  escape  the  hopeless 
cycle  of  poverty  of  the  inner 
cities.  The  fervor  with  which 
the  public  urges  on  the  drug 
cru.sade  may  well  be  a sign  of 
a society  in  turmoil  that  can- 
not seem  to  find  the  way  to 
win  the  drug  war.

Cosmic  Thing 


B-52’s 


by  Kevin  Kruse 

U(Jll  writer 


Before  Athens.  Georgia 
spawned  the  supergroup 
R.E.M..  an  alternative  college 
band  called  the  B-52’s 
emerged  as  a cross  between 
the  Jet.sons  and  John  Water’s 
film  Hair. spray.  Cosmic 
Thing,  their  latest  album,  has 
finally  drawn  widespread  at- 
tention to  the  band. 

The  album  is  a collection 
of  day-glo  funk  and  mellow 
melodies  that  comment  on 
everything  from  television 
and  love  to  freedom  and  lazi- 
ness. The  only  problem  I have 


with  the  album  is  the  lead 
vocals  of  Fred  Schneider.  As 
background  vocals,  he’s 
okay,  but  once  he  takes  the 
lead,  the  song  becomes  dis- 
tracting. Ilis  voice  becomes 
effeminate  and  yet  loud  and 
deep. 

The  v(Kals  of  Kate  Pier- 
son and  Cindy  Wilson  more 
than  make  up  for  his  short 
comings,  as  they  can  sound  as 
angelic,  deep,  or  rough  as  the 
songs  call  for.  Their  harmony 
is  so  intense  at  points  that  they 
blend  into  one  voice.  The 
alternating  soul  and  sweet- 
ness of  their  voices  and  the 


quasi-country  twang  of  Keith 
Strickland’s  guitar  are  what 
will  make  “Love  Shack”  the 
B-52’s  greatest  hit  to  date. 

“Deadbeat  Club”  uses 
the  girls’  harmony  and  the 
near  absence  of  Schneider’s 
vocals  to  create  a beautiful 
and  simple  commentary  on 
social  outclass.  The  title  track 
“Cosmic  Thing”  is  a classic 
B-52’s  tone,  sounding  closely 
similar  to  their  “Rock  Lob- 
ster.” “Channel  Z”  is  like 
“Pee  Wee  Herman  meets 
Andy  Warhol"  in  which  Sch- 
neider dominates  with  his 
ranting  and  mind-bending 


HooDoo  Gurus  in 
Concert  at  Vandy 


by  Kevin  Kruse 

stuU  writer 


A wee  bit  back,  I had  the  dis- 
tinct pleasure  of  being  a part 
of  a lively  conversation  in  the 
spacious  MBA  parking  lot. 
One  member  or  our  circle  was 
a teacher  at  MBA  - Let’s  call 
her  “Jane”  (Jane  isn’t  her  real 
name.  Her  real  name  is  Bar- 
bara Waugh).  “Jane”  was 
asking  us  about  the  upcoming 
HooDoo  Gurus  concert, 
which  we  were  all  planning  to 
artend.  She  had  never  heard 
them  before  and  asked  us  if 
they  were  at  all  like  John  Den- 
ver. “Not  even  close,  ‘Jane." 

After  spending  all  Satur- 
day morning  working  on  the 
homecoming  tapestries,  I 
headed  out  to  the  fabulous 
Vanderbilt  Memorial  Sta- 
dium. Larry  Vranka  drove,  so 
we  were,  of  course,  late  as 
usual.  Sadly,  we  mis.sed  the 
opening  act  - The  Connells, 
but  according  to  my  vast 
sources  (Chris  Waybum  and 
Chris  Petrie),  the  Connells 
were  “real  good.”  What  else 
can  I say? 

We  moseyed  in  at  a quar- 
ter past  nine,  in  between  acts. 
Anxious  to  find  our  .seats  and 
extricate  any  loafers  therein, 
we  waded  through  the  knee- 
deep  bacchanalia  to  get 
settled  in. 

With  “Axe  Grinder,”  the 
Gurus  expkxied  in  a fury  of 


sound  that  kept  even  Larry  at- 
tentive. Dave  Faulkner  led 
his  troops  through  favorites 
such  as  “Good  Times.”  “Dig 
It  Up,”  “I  Want  You  Back.” 
“Mars  Needs  Guitars!,”  “In 
The  Middle  of  the  Land,”  and 
“What’s  My  Scene.”  as  well 
as  launching  into  tracks  off 
their  new  album  Magnum 
Cum  Louder,  such  as  “Come 
Anytime”  and  “Death  in  the 
Afternoon.”  The  Gurus  were 
in  great  form  and  eager  to 
please.  They  even  asked  for 
and  played  an  audience 
rcquest.’Tojo,”  early  into  the 
set. 

Our  ears  began  to  throb 
due  to  the  1 ,000  dB  speaker 
output,  -SO,  under  the  advice  of 
David  Haslam  and  Rob 
Murphy,  we  dragged  Larry, 
who  kept  moaning  “The  hor- 
ror! The  horror!”  up  to  the 
balcony.  From  here,  we  could 
see  the  entire  band  (Faulkner. 
Clyde  Bramley.  Mark 
Kingsmill,  and  Brad  Shep- 
herd) and  actually  listen  to 
them  without  pain.  From  our 
new  vantage  point,  we  saw 
the  entire  crowd  (those  who 
could  still  stand,  at  least) 
screaming  and  dancing  to  ex- 
haustion. I haven’t  seen  a 
concert  this  good  since  the  ’82 
Village  People  reunion  at 
Shea  Stadium.

ized in  a twisted  way. 

With  the  exception  of  a 
couple  of  songs  on  which  the 
bizarreness  overwhelmed 
me,  I enjoyed  the  album.  The 
cynical  irreverence,  similar  in 
topic  to  the  Dead  Milkmen 


and  They  Might  Be  Giants,  is 
somewhat  dampered  on  some 
tracks  but  still  shines  through 
every  now  and  then.  The  B- 
52’s  need  to  rid  themselves  of 
Schneider  and  focus  on  the 
harmonies  of  Wilson  and  Pi- 
erson.

For  the  past  five  years.  Mick 
Jones,  the  former  band-leader 
of  The  Clash,  has  has  been 
very  busy  with  his  new  band 
Big  Audio  Dynamite.  With 
the  help  of  Don  Letts,  Leo  “E- 
Zee-Kiir  Williams,  Greg 
Roberts,  and  Dan  Donovan, 
Mick  had  continued  to  refine 
the  rock/disco  sound  of  the 
band.  The  first  two  albums. 
This  Is  Big  Audio  Dynamite 
and  No.  10  Upping  St„  leaned 
toward  Fifties  style  rock  ‘n’ 
roll,  while  their  third.  Tighten 
Up  Vol.  88,  was  a radical 
swing  toward  a synthesized 
disco  sound. 

During  and  after  the  first 
three  were  various  problems 
which  prevented  the  group 
from  having  the  following  of 
fans  it  deserved  in  the  U.S. 
Restrictions  imposed  by  the

because  of  the  growing  popu- 
larity of  B.A.D..  the  band  is 
now  able  to  enter  the  U.S.  as  a 
band. 

Also,  something  which 
almost  spelled  the  end  of  the 
band  was  Mick's  bout  with 
pneumonia.  He  came  down 
with  it  last  year,  and  it  practi- 
cally destroyed  his  voice.  But 
Mick  got  through  it  and  mi- 
raculously. with  the  help  of 
speech  therapists  and  singing 
lessons,  he  still  has  his  sing- 
ing voice. 


Big  Audio  Dynamite  has 
just  released  their  fourth  al- 
bum and  it  truly  fits  its  title. 
Megatop  Phoenix  consum- 
mates the  band's  rock  and 
reggae  background  and  its 
disco/synthesizer  experi- 
ments. The  album  starts  off 
with  “Start,”  a quick  sample 
from  a movie  followed  by  an 
introduction  screaming, 
“And  now  the  best  band  from 
West  London -B.A.D.!”  The 
album  then  settles  down  into 
some  good  rock/disco  songs 
until  “Around  the  Girl  in  80 
Ways,”  a slow,  romantic  twist 
to  the  girlfriend/boyfriend 
theme.  It  intermingles  Mick’s 
delicate  lyrics  and  rap  from 
Mick.  Leo  “E-Zee-Kill,”  and 
Don  Letts:  “80  ways  around 
the  girl/  Most  of  them  I know/ 
All  of  them  are  substitutes/  for 
feelings  1 don't  show/Tell  her 
what  she  needs  to  know/  eat- 
ing out,  taking  in  a show/  walk 
her  home,  say  goodnight/  you 
play  it  cool,  she  wonders 
why.” 

The  album  then  explodes 
with  the  track  “James 
Brown.”  a fiery  disco  mix 
which  documents  the  King  of 
Soul's  arrest. 

“High  speed  chase/  on 
my  ca.se/  radio  ahead/  A.P.B. 
at  me/  they  said  I shot  the  bed/ 
Road  block  up  ahead7  Driv- 
ing fast/  flashes  past/  Super- 
bad  I said/  Papa's  on  the  run/ 
with  a Cherokee  and  gun/ 
People  need  a hit/  when 


you’re  chasing  No.  1” 

The  album  cools  back 
down  with  “Everybody 
Needs  a Holiday”  and 
“Mick’s  a Hippie  Burning”, 
and  then  comes  “House  Ar- 
rest,” a sarcastic  look  at  the 
world  of  disco:  “Speaker 
pump  that  devil  sound/ every- 
body getting  down/  moon- 
walk  over  to  the  gents/  Exit 
zombie,  many  spent/  Turn- 
stile toilets,  I Joined  the 
queue/  Drinks  at  the  bar. 
Drugs  in  the  loo./  I entered 
Jekyll  and  came  out  Hyde/ 
Mt.  Chevignon’s  inside.” 

The  album  finishes  off 
with  a ballad.  “The  Green 
Lady,”  and  two  vintage 
B.A.D.  songs.  “London 
Bridge”  and  “Stalag  123.” 
“London  Bridge”  concerns 
itself  with  the  falling  state  of 
England’s  economy,  but  as 
Mick  argues.  “Now  Rome  is 
Rome  but  it  ain’t  home/  and 
neither  is  Paris/  Wherever 
I’ve  been  and  all  that  I’ve 
seen/  This  is  home  to  me.” 
The  album  fittingly  ends 
with  “Stalag  123.”  “I  got  the 
studio  blues/  and  some  other 
bad  news/  The  basement’s 
been  swamped  by  flotxl./ 1 got 
the  studio  blues/  and  it’s  ru- 
ined my  shoes/  My  boogie's 
covered  by  mud.” 

It’s  time  to  finish  the 
album  and  let  people  hear  it. 
And  this  is  a great  album  to 
listen  to.  Go  buy  it  boy-ee!

As  anyone  who  has  been  near 
a television,  newspaper,  or 
radio  in  the  past  month  should 
know,  a lethal  earthquake 
struck  San  Francisco  nearly  a 
month  ago  on  Tuesday.  Octo- 
ber 17.  Measuring  7.0  on  the 
Richter  scale,  it  was  the  most 
powerful  earthquake  in  the 
United  States  since  1964.  As 
the  quake  struck,  the  heavily- 
traveled  1-880  collapsed,  a 
tremendous  inferno  broke  out 
in  the  Marina  district,  and 
everywhere,  buildings  col- 
lapsed. 

Remarkably,  early  esti- 
mates of  over  250  dead 
proved  false,  as  only  59 
people  were  actually  killed. 
However,  property  damages 
are  estimated  to  be  in  the  bil- 
lions and  the  reconstruction 
could  lake  up  to  three  years. 
But  for  all  this,  quick  think- 
ing, brotherly  love,  and  well- 
planned  emergency  proce- 
dures prevented  what  is  al- 
ready a tragedy  from  being 
much,  much  worse. 

On  the  night  of  the  quake, 
the  crime  rate  plummeted  to 
the  lowest  level  in  years. 
Several  hotels  permitted  the 
thousands  of  people  who  had 
lost  their  homes  to  sleep  in 
their  lobbies.  Dozens  of  ordi- 
nary citizens  directed  the  clut- 


ronment,  and  expanded  proj- 
ects ied  by  the  trailblazing 
Student  Council  will  con- 
tinue. More  importantly, 
each  individual  student 
should  recognize  the  impor- 
tance of  recycling,  and.  fol- 
lowing the  example  of  MBA. 
should  strive  to  pursue  a recy- 
cling effort  in  his  own  home. 
There  is  a great  deal  more 
readily  recyclable  material  in 
the  everyday  hou.sehold,  and 
it  should  be  the  responsibility 
of  us  citizens  to  see  that  we  do 
not  let  our  garbage  go  to 
waste. 

The  Nashville  area  has 
several  locations  where  one 
can  deposit  recyclable  goods 
for  a marginal  profit,  includ- 
ing Harris-Hillman  Elemen- 


tered  lanes  of  traffic.  Restau- 
rants served  free  food  to  any- 
one who  requested  it.  Coura- 
geous rescue  workers  labored 
hour  after  hour  with  very  little 
sleep  to  free  those  who  might 
still  be  trapped  under  the 
rubble  . 

Their  toil  eventually  paid 
off  nearly  ninety  hours  later 
with  the  discovery  of  57  year- 
old  Buck  Helm  under  the 
remains  of  1-880.  Red  Cross 
volunteers  woriced  equally  as 
hard,  opening  shelters  and 
preparing  and  serving  food  to 
the  hundreds  of  hungry  survi- 
vors. 

After  the  initial  shock  of 
what  had  happened  passed, 
people  came  out  in  droves  to 
help  their  less  fortunate 
neighbors.  One  Red  Cross 
director  reported  that  she  was 
getting  so  many  who  wanted 
to  help  that  she  was  forced  to 
turn  people  away. 

Even  though  the  earth- 
quake is  over  for  most,  the 
danger  is  far  from  over.  Seis- 
mologists have  been  pro- 
claiming for  years  that  earth- 
quakes can  strike  at  any  time 
in  California,  but  it  is  only 
after  a disa.ster  of  this  size 
occurs  that  most  pieople  pay 
attention.  Hopefully,  how- 
ever. the  next  quake  that 
strikes  can  be  handled  as  well 
and  as  quickly  as  this  one. 


tary  School  (26th  Ave.  and 
Blakemore)  and  Nashville 
Tech  (on  White  Bridge 
Road). 

So,  don’t  sit  idly  by  while 
Bordeaux  fills  up  to  its  eye- 
balls with  useful  refu.se!  And 
in  the  words  of  Dr.  Seuss’  The 
borax,  “I  speak  for  the  trees, 
for  the  trees  have  no 
longues!”  : I ask  you  all  to 
think  of  the  trees  when  you 
roll  your  next  spit- wad,  and. 
by  all  means,  deposit  it  in  a 
recycling  box  after  it  has 
stricken  its  target.  Please  do 
your  part  by  tossing  your 
unwanted  paper  in  a recycling 
box,  and  make  an  effort  to 
recycle  you  own  waste  at 
home.

Microbe  Cross  Country 
Places  Fifth  in  HVAC  Finals 


by  Rob  Lance 

I cpni  ti'i 


The  microbe  cross-country 
team  had  a successful  season 
this  fall.  The  team  started  off 
right  with  the  defeat  of  USN. 
BGA,  and  Harding  in  their 
first  meet. 

The  second  meet  did  not 
prove  to  be  as  successful  as 
the  first  as  the  little  Big  Red 
suffered  a loss  to  a strong 
Brentwood  Middle  School 
team.  In  the  third  meet,  the 
MBA  runners  placed  a close 
second  behind  rival  Bren- 
twood Middle  School  again. 

In  the  fourth  and  last 
meet,  the  microbes  took  first 
place  out  of  seven.  Geared  up 
for  the  HVAC  finals,  the 
microbes  finished  victorious 
over  their  rival  Brentwood 


Middle  School,  but  second  to 
Ensworth.  The  top  five  for 
MBA  finished  very  well  with 
Taylor  Harris  taking  4th, 
Robert  West  taking  10th, 
Andrew  Love  taking  13th, 
Rob  Welhoelter  taking  18th, 
and  Phillip  Guengerich  as 
34th. 

Noticable  improvements 
were  made  by  all  of  MBA’s 
top  five  as  each  got  his  best 
time  of  the  season.  Jonathan 
Fly  and  Kenneth  Pruitt  fin- 
ished sixth  and  seventh  respe- 
cively  for  the  team,  and  both 
brok  the  ten-minute  mark. 

This  year’s  second  place 
finish  is  a only  foreshadowing 
of  next  year’s  strength  since 
five  of  the  top  seven  will  be 
returning  as  eighth  graders 
next  year.

Varsity  Football  Closes  Season 


by  Alden  Smith 

Sliijf  u poi  tci 


After  an  exciting  10-0  Home- 
coming victory  over  Overton, 
sealed  by  Patrick 
Harkleroad’s  43  yard  field 
goal  off  the  left  hash,  the 
MBA  varsity  football  team 
was  hopeful  for  a playoff 
berth  three  weeks  later.  The 
Big  Red  was  in  a three  way  tie 
for  first  place  and  would  have 
to  beat  Hillsboro  and  Hill- 
wood  for  a playoff  opportu- 
nity. For  an  optimistic  Big 
Red  team,  little  did  they  know 
that  the  thrill  of  victory  had 
come  to  an  end. 

MBA’s  efforts  to  spoil 
Hillsboro’s  50th  Anniversary 
Homecoming  proved  futile 
when  MBA’s  offense  failed 
to  light  up  the  scoreboard  in  a 
14-0  loss  to  the  Burros. 
Managing  a victory  only  in 


the  Canned  Food  Drive  com- 
petition, MBA  was  taken  out 
of  the  playoff  hunt. 

The  Big  Red  again  went 
on  the  road  to  take  on  Hill- 
wood,  a team  that  had  de- 
feated Hillsboro  earlier  in  the 
sea.son.  After  a hard-fought 
0-0  tie  at  the  half,  MBA  man- 
aged only  a fourteen  yard 
scoring  strike  from  De  Th- 
ompson to  Tate  McDaniel, 
whereas  Hillwood’s  high- 
powered  offen.se  exploded  for 
twenty-eight  points.  The  Big 
Red  was  unable  to  defend  the 
Hilltopper’s  #24  Rahmig  Ish- 
mael  on  the  delay  pass  across 
the  middle. 

But  wait!  The  MBA 
football  team  still  had  a 
chance  to  avenge  its  last  two 
losses,  having  been  invited  to 
play  against  Smyrna  in  a bowl 
game  in  McMinnville  the  fol- 


lowing week.  As  fate  would 
have  it,  however  a scene  of 
turmoil  among  Henderson- 
ville, Franklin,  Smyrna,  and 
MBA  would  fail  to  straighten 
itself  out  until  loo  late,  leav- 
ing MBA  stranded  without  a 
game. 

This  anticlimactic  end  to 
over  three  months  of  dedica- 
tion and  sacrifice  was  a disap- 
pointment to  say  the  least. 

Next  year’s  team  cer- 
tainly should  learn  from  two 
years  of  bowl  game  conflicts 
that  the  playoffs  are  where  all 
the  action  is. 

The  1989  MBA  Varsity 
Football  Team  wishes  to  ex- 
press its  deepest  appreciation 
to  the  coaches,  cheerleaders, 
and  students  for  their  valued 
support. 


Congratulation  to  the  Junior  Varsity  Football 
Team  for  an  undefeated  record  and  the 
District  title  this  year!

This  year’s  freshman  football 
team,  under  the  tutelage  of 
coach  Forehand  and  assistant 
coaches  Herring  and  Mikell. 
made  for  an  impre.ssive  turn- 
around this  year.  After  a 
lowly  I -2  start,  the  Frosh  de- 
veloped the  right  attitude  - a 
winning  one  - and  came 
within  one  play  of  winning 
their  district.  In  the  district 
championship  game  with 
Whites  Creek,  the  “zebras” 
unfortunately  called  a bogus 


penalty  on  a technicality  and 
reversed  a game-winning 
touchdown  pass  from  R.A.

thwarting  the  Frosh  in  their 
quest  for  the  district  crown.

Undefeated  J.V.  Football 
Team  Takes  District  Title 


Chalk  one  up  for  the  gotxl 
guys. 


The  Districl  title  came 
home  to  MBA  this  October  as 
the  Junior  Varsity  completed 
its  undefeated  season  with  a 
30-0  shellacking  of  the 
Hillsboro  Burros. 

This  year’s  edition  of 
J.V.  Football  proved  to  be  the 
best  in  recent  memory  as  they 
outscored  their  opponents  by 
a whopping  157-19  in  seven 
games.  A high  scoring  of- 
fense was  well  comple- 
mented by  a smothering  de- 
fense, which  put  the  dreaded 
goose  egg  on  five  unlucky 
opponents. 

While  the  roster  var- 
ied throughout  the  season 
(since  some  players  moved  to 
and  from  the  varsity),  the 
team  was  consistently  led  by 
quarterback  "Hollywood” 
Joe  Underwood  on  offense, 
and  linebacker  Michael 
Brooks  on  defense. 

Joining  Underwood  on 


offense  were  running  backs 
Keith  McCarty,  Chris 
Johnston,  and  Eric  "E" 
Crawford,  receivers  Todd 
“Toast”  Foust.  Jarratt  “1 
scored  two  touchdowns” 
Bell,  and  the  immortal 
Russell  “Cobra”  Acosta. 

Important  linemen  on 
both  sides  of  the  ball  were  Ray 
Brooks,  Jeffrey  Buntin.  Bo 
Bartholomew,  and  Paul  “I  can 
kick,  too”  Moser.  Other  im- 
portant defenders  were 
Jackson  Wray,  kick-blocker 
Crawford,  and  Morgan 
“Kwame”  Parker,  who  also 
played  quarterback. 

The  Big  Red  opened 
the  season  with  a five  touch- 
down bashing  of  Pearl-Cohn. 
The  following  week,  they 
traveled  to  Hendersonville, 
where  they  pulled  out  a 1 4- 1 3 
victory  over  the  Commandos. 

Then  the  Hunters  Lane 
Warriors  went  down  by  three 
touchdowns  before  the  Big 
Red  flattened  the  Father  Ryan 
Fightin’  Irish  40-0  (Yessir, 
dadgummit!). 


Next,  MBA  journeyed  to 
Whites  Creek  for  a barn- 
burner. A defensive  struggle 
ensued  until  a 60  yard  Under- 
wood-to- Johnston  pass  set  up 
the  high  point  of  the  season,  a 
20  yard  field  goal  by  Shad 
Weaver.  The  defense  then 
made  a crucial,  last  second, 
goal-line  stand  to  clinch  the  3- 
0 victory. 

The  following  week,  the 
J.V.  beat  Overton  8-6  on  the 
strength  of  a safety  and  a 
missed  Bobcat  field  goal  be- 
fore clinching  a berth  in  the 
(mythical)  J.V.  Clinic  Bowl 
by  stopping  Hillsboro  at 
home. 

While  the  J.V.  should 
be  praised  for  a great  season, 
they  also  deserve  recognition 
for  all  the  extra  work  they  did 
on  scout  team  to  get  the  var- 
sity ready  for  Friday  night. 
This  year’s  J.V.  certainly 
seems  ready  to  test  them- 
selves on  Varsity  next  year,  as 
they  have  proved  in  having  a 
good  time  winning  on  Mon- 
day afternoons.

Varsity  X-Country 
Takes  Fifth  in  State 


by  (leorge  Kiel/ 


On  October  26,  MBA  runners 
met  at  the  Steeplechase  to 
defend  their  Region  title. 
There  they  encountered  their 
regional  rivals  from 
Hillsboro,  whom  they  had 
barely  beaten  the  year  before. 

This  year  the  MBA  team 
reasserted  its  supremacy  by 
soundly  defeating  strong 
teams  from  Hillsboro  and 
David  Lipscomb.  Keith  Ikard 
won  the  race  with  the  fastest 
time  in  Region  V history, 
while  Casey  Jones  ran  a su- 
perb race  to  finish  third.  Co- 
captain Dan  James  and  Fresh- 
man Glenn  Gaston  both  ran 
personal  records,  placing  3 1 st 
and  33rd  respectively.  Justin 
and  John  Crosslin  and  Alex 
Rogers  also  helped  MBA  earn 
its  victory  in  the  regional 
meet. 

On  a sunny  Saturday  two 
weeks  later,  the  1989  team 
assembled  for  the  last  time  at 
the  state  meet.  As  the  team 
stretched,  the  course  filled 
with  spectators  and  the  tough- 
est runners  in  Tennessee. 

As  the  gun  went  off, 
Ikard  and  Jones  settled  into 
fifth  and  sixth  places,  then 
moved  into  first  and  second  at 
the  mile  pole.  After  2.5  miles, 
favorite  Benny  Dix  built  a 15- 
yard  lead,  but  collapsed  in  the 
final  yards  of  the  race. 
Shortly  thereafter.  David 


Sexton  challenged  Ikard  and 
the  two  battled  until  the  final 
hill,  where  Sexton  pulled 
away.  Fearing  that  Benny 
Dix  would  recover,  our  he- 
roes (Ikard  and  Jones)  dashed 
madly  for  the  finish,  placing 
2nd  (15:37)  and  3rd  (15:45), 
respectively. 

Not  far  behind  was  a very 
motivated  Dan  James,  who 
ran  the  fastest  race  of  his  life 
by  a full  14  seconds  to  place 
49th  overall.  Freshman 
Glenn  Gaston  also  ran  a per- 
sonal best  of  17:26  to  finish 
fourth  for  MBA.  Justin 
Crosslin  and  Matt  Zibas  fol- 
lowed shortly  with  freshman 
John  Crosslin  a few  seconds 
behind  them. 

Because  of  the  efforts  of 
the  whole  team,  MBA  fin- 
ished fifth  in  the  state  behind 
Dobyns  Bennett,  Oak  Ridge, 
Knox  Farragut,  and  Bren- 
twood Academy. 

Although  the  1990  team 
will  lose  the  efforts  of  Dan 
James,  as  well  as  seniors 
Brandon  Barrett,  Andrew 
Duthie,  and  David  Lott,  six  of 
the  top  seven  runners  will  be 
returning.  Jones  and  Ikard 
should  lead  the  team,  with 
strong  backup  from  the 
Crosslin  brothers.  Glenn  Gas- 
ton, Matt  Zibas,  and  hope- 
fully a revamped  George 
Rietz.  With  this  in  mind,  the 
Big  Red  should  have  an  even 
better  state  finish  next  year.
