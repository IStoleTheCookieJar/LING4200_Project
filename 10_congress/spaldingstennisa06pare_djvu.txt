Spalding's 
Athletic  Library 

Anticipating  the  present  ten- 
dency of  the  American  people 
toward  a  healthful  method  of  living 
and  enjoyment,  Spalding's  Athletic 
Library  was  established  in  1892  for 
the  purpose  of  encouraging  ath- 
letics in  every  form,  not  only  by 
publishing  the  official  rules  and 
records  pertaining  to  the  various 
pastimes,  but  also  by  instructing, 
until  to-day  Spalding's  Athletic 
Library  is  unique  in  its  own  par- 
ticular field  and  has  been  conceded 
the  greatest  educational  series  on 
athletic  and  physical  training  sub- 
jects that  has  ever  been  compiled. 
The  publication  of  a  distinct 
series  of  books  devoted  to  athletic 
sports  and  pastimes  and  designed 
to  occupy  the  premier  place  in 
America  in  its  class  was  an  early 
idea  of  Mr.  A.  G.  Spalding,  who 
was  one  of  the  first  in  America 
to  publish  a  handbook  devoted  to 
athletic  sports,  Spalding's  Official 
Base  Ball  Guide  being  tlie  initial 
number,  which  was  followed  at  intervals  with  other  handbooks  on  the 
sports  prominent  in  the  '70s. 

Spalding's  Athletic  Library  has  had  the  advice  and  counsel  of  Mr.  A.  G. 
Spalding  in  all  of  its  undertakinprs,  and  particularly  in  all  books  devoted 
to  the  national  game.  This  applies  especially  to  Spalding's  Official 
Base  Ball  Guide  and  Spalding's  Official  Base  Ball  Record,  both  of  which 
receive  the  personal  attention  of  Mr.  A.  G.  Spalding,  owing  to  his  early 
connection  with  the  game  as  the  leading  pitcher  of  the  champion  Boston 
and  Chicago  teams  of  1872-76.  His  interest  does  not  stop,  however,  with 
matters  pertaining  to  base  ball;  there  is  not  a  sport  that  Mr.  Spalding 
does  not  make  it  his  business  to  become  familiar  with,  and  that  the 
Library  will  always  maintain  its  premier  place,  with  Mr.  Spalding's  able 
counsel  at  hand,  goes  without  saying. 

The  entire  series  since  the  issue  of  the  first  number  has  been  under 
the  direct  personal  supervision  of  Mr.  James  E.  Sullivan,  President 
of  the  American  Sports  Publishing  Company,  and  the  total  series  of 
consecutive  numbers  reach  an  aggregate  of  considerably  over  three 
hundred,  included  in  which  are  many  "annuals,"  that  really  constittite 
the  history  of  their  particular  sport  in  America  year  by  year,  back  copies 
of  which  are  even  now  eagerly  sought  for,  constituting  as  they  do  the 
really  first  authentic  records  of  events  and  official  rules  that  have  ever 
been  consecutively  compiled. 

When  Spalding's  Athletic  Library  was  founded,  seventeen  years  ago, 
track  and  field  athletics  were  practically  unknown  outside  the  larger 
colleges  and  a  few  athletic  clubs  in  the  leading  cities,  which  gave  occa- 
sional meets,  when  an  entry  list  of  250  competitors  was  a  subject  of  com- 
ment; golf  was  known  only  by  a  comparatively  few  persons;  lawn  tennis 
had  some  vogue  and  base  ball  was  practically  the  only  established  field

sport,  and  that  in  a  professional  way;  basket  ball  had  just  been  invented; 
athletics  for  the  schoolboy— and  schoolgirl— were  almost  unknown,  and 
an  advocate  of  class  contests  in  athletics  in  the  schools  could  not  get  a 
hearing.  To-day  we  find  the  greatest  body  of  athletes  in  the  world  ia 
the  Public  Schools  Athletic  League  of  Greater  New  York,  which  has  had 
an  entry  list  at  its  annual  games  of  over  two  thousand,  and  in  whose 
''elementary  series"  in  base  ball  last  year  106  schools  competed  for  the 
trophy  emblematic  of  the  championship.         ,  .        , 

While  Spalding's  Athletic  Library  cannot  claim  that  the  rapid  growth 
of  athletics  in  this  country  is  due  to  St  solely,  the  fact  cannot  be  denied 
that  the  books  have  had  a  great  deal  to  do  with  its  encouragement,  by 
printing  the  official  rules  and  instructions  for  playing  the  various  games 
at  a  nominal  price,  within  the  reach  of  everyone,  with  the  sole  object 
that  its  series  might  be  complete  and  the  one  place  where  a  person 
could  look  with  absolute  certainty  for  the  particular  book  in  which  he 
might  be  interested,  _  „      .,  .         .      i       ^^      ,     j 

In  selecting  the  editors  and  writers  for  the  various  books,  the  lead- 
ing authority  in  his  particular  line  has  been  obtained,  with  the  result 
that  no  collection  of  books  on  athletic  subjects  can  compare  with 
Spalding's  Athletic  Library  for  the  prominence  of  the  various  authors 
and  their  ability  to  present  their  subjects  in  a  thorough  and  practical 
manner.  ,      ,  ,.     ,  «  ^^      i      •.

WALTER   CAMP 

For  quarter  of  a  century  Mr.  Walter  Camp 
of  Yale  has  occupied  a  leading  position  in  col- 
lege athletics.  It  is  immaterial  what  organiza- 
tion is  suggested  for  college  athletics,  or  for 
the  betterment  of  conditions,  insofar  as  college 
athletics  is  concerned,  Mr.  Camp  has  always 
played  an  important  part  in  its  conferences, 
and  the  great  interest  in  and  high  plane  of 
college  sport  to-day.  are  undoubtedly  due  more 
to  Mr.  Camp  than  to  any  other  individual.  Mr. 
Camp  has  probably  written  more  on  college 
athletics  than  any  other  writer  and  the  leading  papers  and  maga- 
zines of  America  are  always  anxious  to  secure  his  expert  opmion  on  foot 
ball,  track  and  field  athletics,  base  ball  and  rowmg.  Mr  Camp  has  grown 
up  with  Yale  athletics  and  is  a  part  of  Yale's  remarkable  athleticsystem 
While  he  has  been  designated  as  the  Father  of  \  oot  Ball,  it  is  a  well 
known  fact  that  during  his  college  career  Mr  Camp  was  regarded  as  one 
of  the  best  players  that  ever  represented  Yale  on  the  base  ball  field,  so 
when  we  hear  of  Walter  Camp  as  a  foot  ball  expert  we  must  also  remem- 
ber his  remarkable  knowledge  of  the  game  of  base  ball  of  which  he  is  a 
great  admirer.  Mr.  Camp  has  edited  Spalding  s  OfficialJ- oot  Ball  Guide 
since  it  was  first  published,  and  also  the  Spalding  Athletic  Library  book 
on  How  to  Play  Foot  Ball.  There  is  certainly  no  man  in  American  college 
life  better  qualified  to  write  for  Spalding'3  Athletic  Library  than  Mr. 
Camp.

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TKNNIS    ANNUAL. 


The    National    Championships 

On  August  15  the  thirty-first  annual  championship  of  the  United  States 
began  on  the  Casino  courts  at  Newport.  One  hundred  and  eighty-one 
names  were  drawn,  seventeen  more  than  the  record  year  of  1909.  In 
many  respects  the  event  was  similar  to  the  previous  season's,  but  one 
feature  was  pre-eminent.  It  was  the  remarkable  strength  of  the  Pacific 
Coast  men,  who  until  a  year  ago  were  unrecognized  and  unknown  quan- 
tities in  the  world  of  Eastern  tennis.  It  was  one  of  these,  T.  C.  Ikuidy 
of  Los   Angeles,  who   came  through  the  tournament  and  gave   champion   W. 

A.  Larned  the  hardest  liglit  in  the  challenge  round  he  had  experienced 
since  winning  the  title  for  the  third  time  in    1907. 

It  was  a  great  five-set  battle,  played  on  August  25,  in  intense  heat, 
which  affected  both  men  to  a  great  degree  and  which,  before  the  match 
ended,  aided  materially  in  accomplishing  the  sturdy  little  Westerner's 
downfall. 

Unusually  bad  weather  made  much  of  the  early  play  in  the  tournament 
most  unsatisfactory,  and  it  was  not  until  the  fifth  day  of  play  that  the 
courts  recovered  from  the  drenching  they  had  received  early  in  the  week. 
During  the  time  of  inclement  weather  conditions,  the  process  of  eliminat- 
ing the  weaker  men,  many  of  whom  were  completely  outclassed,  progressed 
fairly,  and  it  was  not  until  Friday  that  the  brackets  brought  together  the 
stronger  contenders.  Only  one  match  of  exceptional  interest  was  played 
in  the  earlier  rounds,  and  that  was  in  the  first,  where  W.  F.  Johnson  was 
beaten  by  T.  R.  Pell  in  straight  sets.  Johnson's  game,  although  by  no 
means  the  best  of  which  he  is  capable  of  playing,  was  not  the  kind  to  over- 
come Pell's  strength  at  the  net,  and  the  latter,  whose  confidence  increased 
as  the  match  continued,  had  complete  control  of  the  situation  toward  its  end. 

In  the  fourth  round  McLoughlin,  runner-up  to  W.  J.  Clothier  in  1909, 
met  and  won  from  R.  H.  Palmer  in  four  rather  easy  sets;  J.  D.  E.  Jones 
beat  F.  J.  Sulloway  after  a  long-winded  fray  and  B.  C.  Wright  eliminated 
R.  A.  Holden.  The  latter  match  was  the  featured  one  of  the  day  and 
Holden,  though  beaten  in  three  straight,  played  a  clever,  fast  game.  The 
lower  half  provided  by  far  the  better  matches  of  the  round,  in  one  of 
which  Dean  Mathey  disposed  of  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  providing  the  first  form 
reversal  of  the  tournament.  F.  C.  Inman  won  from  T.  Ilendrick,  and  C. 
R.  Gardner  of  California,  playing  in  his  first  championship,  put  out  P. 
Siverd  of  Pittsburg  after  four  fairly  even  sets.  The  ultimate  tournament 
winner,  Bundy,  had  an  easy  match  which  placed  him  against  W.  B. 
Cragin,  Jr.,   the  latter  having  taken  the  measure  of  J.   O.   Ames. 

The  match  of  the  third  round  was  that  played  between   N.   W.   Niles  and 

B.  C.  Wright.  It  extended  over  four  sets,  the  men  dividing  the  first  two. 
Niles  was  in  good  form,  but  Wright  was  at  the  top  of  his  game,  and  com- 
bined speed  and  judgment  with  a  wonderful  degree  of  accuracy,  against 
which  Niles'  best  efforts  were  useless. 

In  the  same  round  Pell  faced  McLoughlin  and  played  an  unusually 
strong  game.  He  was  several  times  within  a  point  of  the  second  set,  but 
after  losing  it  ultimately  at  10/8,  fell  off  decidedly  in  the  third.  In  the 
afternoon  Hendrick  played  W.  M.  Washburn  and  the  boy  forced  the 
doubles  challenger  to  five  long  sets. 

Most  important  in  every  sense  in  the  next  round  was  the  match  between 
Gardner  and  F.  C.  Colston.  The  former  started  splendidly,  but  after 
annexing  the  opening  set,  6/2,  became  very  erratic,  and  Colston  ran  out 
the  second  and  third,  6/2,  6/3.  The  fourth  was  but  half  over  when  rain 
ended  play  for  the  day.  Starting  the  following  morning  with  a  lead  of 
3/1    against   him    Gardner   won   three   games   in   a   row,   but   here   again   he 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  27 

faltered  on  several  easy  shots,  and,  due  to  his  errors  more  tlian  any  other 
cause,  Colston  took  the  set,  6/4.  The  first  big  upset  was  commenced  on 
the  championships  court  immediately  after  the  Colston-Gardner  match  ended, 
\vhen  Mathey  took  the  court  against  F.  C.  Inman.  Inman,  considered 
much  the  stronger  of  the  two,  was  badly  beaten  by  the  young  Princetonian 
in  straight  sets.  The  latter  played  a  splendid  game  and  used  both  fore 
and  backward  drives  with  deadly  effect.  He  made  few-  errors  and  was 
strong  on  all  of  his  strokes.  Inman,  on  the  other  hand,  started  poorly 
and  ultimately  became  completely  disconcerted  by  his  opponent's  persistent 
steadiness. 

The  men  to  reach  the  semi-finals  were  Whitney,  Wright,  Colston  and 
Bundy.  In  the  upper  half  Whitney  had  an  easy  time  winuing  from  Fulton 
Cutting,  while  Bundy  did  not  have  grvat  difficulty  in  disixising  of  Cragin. 
The  latter's  steadiness  and  habit  of  trying  for  everything  won  for  him  the 
opening  set,  but  thereafter  Bundy,  by  coming  to  the  net,  won  with  plenty 
of  margin  to  spare.  Colston's  win  from  Mathey  was  expected,  but  the 
Baltimorean  had  to  exert  his  best  efforts  to  accomplish  it.  The  remaining 
match  was,  "from  a  point  of  importance,  second  only  to  the  final  anil  chal- 
lenge rounds,  for  the  winner  of  the  all-comers  was  confidently  anticipated 
in  the  person  of  the  victor.  It  was  between  Wright  and  McLoughlin,  and 
though  disappointingly  one-sidetl,  jiroved  wliat  many  considered  to  be  the 
best  tennis  of  the  meeting.  Probably  with  the  memory  of  his  Longwood 
defeat  at  McLoughlin's  hands  as  an  incentive  to  bring  out  the  best  that 
was  in  hirn,  Wright  played  as  he  had  not  played  for  several  seasons,  but 
no  such  inspiration  served  his  young  rival,  wlio  seemed  oppressed  by  the 
importance  of  this  second  meeting.  The  latter  played  far  below  his  best 
form  and,  strange  as  it  may  seem,  hit  with  less  pace  than  his  famous 
opponent.  Wright,  however,  played  as  one  possessed.  He  was  all  over  the 
court,  hitting  with  wonderful  speed  and  deadly  accuracy  and  anticipating 
McLoughlin's  every  shot  with  a  certainty  amazing.  At  the  very  outset  he 
blocked  McLoughlin's  fastest  shots  and  changed  the  pace  and  depth  of  his 
own  in  a  manner  which  threw  his  opponent  hopelessly  off.  The  match  had 
not  progressed  far  before  the  Californian  had  deserted  entirely  the  free- 
dom and  speed  of  his  sirokes,  so  essential  to  the  success  of  his  game,  in 
his  effort  to  steady  himself  and  play  carefully.  That  such  a  change  against 
Wright  was  a  fatal  mistake  was  immediately  proved,  and  the  Bostonian, 
with  increased  aggressiveness,  held  the  upper  hand  throughout  the 
remainder  of  play.  McLoughlin  tried  everything  to  change  the  outcome, 
but  at  the  net  or  remaining  back  it  was  with  the  same  result.  Wright's 
returns  of  service  were  directed  at  the  Californian's  feet  and  the  slow 
rising  volleys  which  necessarily  resulted  were  (|uite  useless  and  ineffective. 
There  were  many  short,  sharp  and  brilliant  rallies,  but  the  great  majority 
resulted  in  favor  of  the  ex-champion.  The  latter  made  remarkably  few 
errors,  whereas  McLoughlin  frequently  misplayed  shots  of  the  easiest 
nature.  The  full  score  was  6/3,  6/3,  6/2,  and  the  match,  though  a  failure 
from  the  standpoint  of  a  contest,  was  interesting  because  of  Wright's 
excellence. 

Both  semi-final  matches  ran  true  to  form,  but  by  what  a  narrow  margin 
may  be  judged  from  the  score  of  the  Wright- Whitney  engagement  of  4/6, 
7/5.  4/6,  6/2,  7/5.  Whitney,  the  interscholastic  champion,  was  once  within 
a  point  of  victory,  and  in  the  minds  of  many  spectators  lost  through 
youthful  impetuosity  when  he  volleyed  a  hard  chop  which,  had  it  continued 
on  its  course,  threatened  to  find  a  resting  place  far  beyond  the  base  line. 
Whitney  won  the  first  set,  6  '4,  and  lost  the  second  only  after  the  score 
was  tied  at  5-all.  He  won  the  third,  6/4,  but  Wright  had  all  the  better 
of  the  fourth  at  6/2.  The  fifth  was  nip-and-tuck  until  Whitney  led  at  5/4 
and  40/30.  He  netted  the  next  play  and  fell  heavily  in  the  one  following. 
The  mishaps  slowed  him  up  greatly  and  Wright  won  the  game  and  set  at 
7/5.  It  was  a  great  contest,  but  the  winner  seemed  suffering  from  a  reac- 
tion  of   his   brilliant   performance    of   the   day   before.      His  game    was  very 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  29 

soft,  and  on  the  whole  lacked  the  accuracy  for  which  it  is  noted.  The 
other  semi-tinal  ended  in  favor  of  lUmdy,  after  four  fast  sets,  during 
which  Colston  was  played  to  a  standstill.  The  Baltimorean,  by  steady, 
accurate  driving,  won  the  first  set  at  8  6.  He  was  quite  as  effective  as  his 
rival  at  the  net  and  a  little  surer  off  the  ground.  But  with  the  beginning 
of  the  second  set  Bundy  decided  on  a  plan  of  campaign  against  which 
Colston  was  practically  helpless.  With  splendid  control  he  resorted  to 
change  of  pace  that  the  straighter,  harder  game  of  his  opponent  was  of 
little  use  against.  He  lobbed,  drove  and  chopped  his  retur^-s  off  short  in 
such  a  fashion  that  Colston  was  constantly  diving  and  rushing  about  the 
court  and  in  the  latter  half  of  the  match  was  physically  unable  to  go 
through  more  than  the  formality  of  playing  out  the  finish.  It  was  a  piece 
of  unexcelled  generalship,  for  which  the  winner  was  warmly  applauded. 

The  final  was  played  on  August  24  and  the  result,  when  considered  in 
view  of  the  circumstances  of  the  previous  day's  play,  was  less  surprising 
than  many  at  lirst  imagined  it  to  be. 

Wright  was  obviously  off  and  slow  in  starting,  while  Bundy  struck  his 
stride  immediately.  Sharp  but  rather  careful  ]»lay  gave  the  Westerner  the 
opening  set  in  little  time  at  6/3,  but  there  was  general  astonishment  when 
he  continued  his  winning  streak  with  so  little  serious  opposition,  until  the 
second  set  reached  21  in  his  favor.  Wright  got  a  game  at  that  point,  but 
Bundy  took  the  seventh  at  love  and  his  second  set  a  moment  later. 

Knowing  Wright's  proclivity  for  pulling  matches  out  from  apparently- 
hopeless  positions,  the  spectators  waited  expectantly  for  the  Bostonian  to 
take  command,  but  Bundy,  throwing  caution  to  the  winds,  played  all  around 
his  opponent  until  he  led  at  5/1.  Wright  won  the  succeeding  game  and 
it  was  Bundy's  service  at  5/2.  Several  times  was  the  Californian  within  a 
stroke  of  winning,  but  each  time  Wright  jjulled  out  and  then  began  a  run 
of  brilliant,  desperate  play  that  is  well-nigh  impossible  of  description. 
Taking  every  chance,  the  internationalist  hammered  out  game  after  game, 
until  he  led  at  6/3.  Bundy  evened  the  score  then,  but  Wright  killed  lob 
after  lob  which  his  opponent  kept  sending  up  and  took  the  set,  8/6.  It 
was  a  really  wonderful  pull-up  and  the  enthusiasm  of  the  enormous  crowd 
was  boundless.  The  fourth  set  was  bitterly  contested,  and  was  for  the 
most  part  a  battle  of  services.  Wright  led  up  to  S^j,  at  which  point  Bundy 
succeeded  in  breaking  through  for  his  own  service,  followed  by  Wright's. 
The  next  and  last  game  was  easily  the  Californian's,  and  the  match  ended 
when   he   smashed  beautifully  a  high   deep  lob. 

Unusual  heat  heralded  in  the  day  of  the  challenge  match  and  continued 
to  increase  as  time  went  on.  Long  before  the  contestants  appeared  the 
crowd  commenced  to  assemble,  and  by  the  time  jilay  was  called  nearly  four 
thousand  had  arranged  themselves  around  the  court. 

Larned  served  first  and  took  the  game  at  love  on  three  nets  and  an  out. 
Bundy  followed  by  winning  at  15.  The  champion  seemed  perplexed  by  the 
way  in  which  the  ball  shot  off  his  racket.  He  made  one  point  on  a  weak 
return,  which  Bundy  flubbed.  At  that  point  the  latter  seemed  to  lose  his 
control  and  Larned,  playing  faster  with  each  stroke,  lost  no  time  in  run- 
ning out  five  games.  The  second  set  was  just  the  reverse  of  its  prede- 
cessor. Bundy  steadied  and  Larned  slackened  his  pace  a  trifle,  due  probably 
to  the  extreme  humidity.  The  latter  played  more  from  the  base  line,  but 
the  Californian,  realizing  the  futility  of  a  similar  course,  rushed  the  net 
whenever  it  was  possible.  The  games  were  all  close,  but  at  last  at  5/4 
Bundy  broke  through  the  title  holder's  delivery  for  the  set.  The  third  set 
started  with  Larned  wearing  a  blue  jockey  cap,  head  covering  he  seldom 
resorts  to,  and  Bundy  discarding  the  hat  which  he  had  jammed  on  at  the 
beginning  of  the  second  set.  Evidently  the  latter  felt  unequal  to  the  strain 
required  of  him  at  that  time,  for  after  a  game  of  apparent  deliberation 
which  he  lost,  he  made  little  effort  for  the  remainder  of  the  set,  which 
the  champion  won  at  6/0. 

With  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  set  Larnedj  for  the  second  time  during 


SPALDINO'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  3l 

the  match,  started  poorly.  Bundy  was  determined,  and  after  winning  his 
service,  quickly  ran  up  to  3/1,  largely  due  to  Larned's  errors.  The  latter 
then  steadied  and  by  faultless  driving  evened  the  score,  allowing  "Little 
Nap,"  as  Bundy's  enthusiastic  friends  are  wont  to  term  him,  but  one 
point.  From  then  on  it  was  very  even,  neither  man  being  able  to  do  much 
with  the  other's  service.  Bundy  won  his  own  to  make  the  score  7/6,  run- 
ning in  and  cutting  off  two  hard  side  line  drives  for  perfect  stop  volleys. 
At  30-all  in  the  following  game  Larned  smashed  a  short  lob  out  and  Bundy 
made  a  beautiful   backhand   drive   cross  court  for   the   set  point. 

Starting  on  an  even  basis  at  two  sets  all  Bundy  won  hir  service  for 
the  opening  game  and  thereby  took  the  lead  for  the  first  and  last  time 
in  the  match.  Larned  won  his  own  delivery,  and  then  followed  one  of  the 
fiercest  rallies  of  the  set  for  the  advantage  game.  Larned  finally  won  it 
and  its  loss  spelled  defeat  for  the  stocky  little  challenger.  Only  once 
after  that  did  he  again  fight  it  out  with  the  American  master.  That  was 
in  the  fifth  game,  when  he  succeeded  in  bringing  the  score  to  deuce.  The 
rest  of  the  set  took  but  a  few  minutes.  Bundy  was  in  great  distress, 
actually  staggering  and  with  all  sense  of  judgment  gone.  Twice  he  struck 
wildly  at  balls  that  were  yards  from  his  racket  and  once  he  watched  a 
ball,  in  a  dazed  manner,  which  with  but  a  step  forward,  he  might  easily  have 
reached.  Larned,  too,  was  thoroughly  exhausted,  but  because  he  refused 
to  play  at  the  net  and  thereby  covered  only  a  small  part  of  the  ground 
Bundy  did,  his  condition  was  much  better  than  the  challenger's  when 
the  end  came.

ning the  preliminary  doubles  and  the  right  to  challenge  F.  B.  Alexander 
and  H.  H.  Hackett  at  Newport,  the  team  who,  since  they  first  annexed 
the  National  Championship  four  years  ago,  have  reigned  supreme  with 
many  brilliant  victories  and  not  a  single  defeat  to  mar  a  faultless  record. 

The  men  who  essayed  to  accomplish  w^hat  not  a  few  are  beginning  to 
believe  impossible  were  T.  C.  Bundy  and  Trow  Hendrick,  the  Californians 
who  upset  Western  tennis  calculation  by  disposing  of  the  young  American 
rei)resentatives  to  Australia  of  two  years  ago,  M.  E.  McLoughlin  and 
M.  IL  Long,  in  the  Pacific  Coast  Doubles  Championship. 

The  match  was  played  on  Tuesday,  August  16,  under  fair  conditions  and 
before  a  crowd  of  several  thousand.  Hackett  served  first,  and  Alexander 
and  he  lost  no  time  in  getting  under  way.  Both  were  in  great  form,  par- 
ticularly Alexander,  whose  topped  drive  rarely  missed  and  was  equally 
rarely  returned.  The  challengers,  on  the  other  hand,  were  very  slow  in 
coming  round,  and  during  the  first  set,  in  which  their  lot  was  but  a  single 
game,  their  play  for  the  most  part  was  ridiculously  weak.  Probably  under- 
estimating the  strength  of  the  team  opposing  them,  the  champions  took 
things  rather  easily  in  the  beginning  of  the  second  set,  and  in  almost  no 
time  the  score  stood  at  4/1  against  them.  As  a  result  some  of  the  pret- 
tiest and  fastest  tennis  of  the  match  came  in  the  following  three  games. 
Hackett  and  Alexander,  who  had  hitherto  played  an  aggressive,  if  some- 
what erratic  game,  found  a  worthy  occasion  to  display  a  defense  through 
which   nothing  could  pass,  a  defense  impregnable,   with  not  one  ball   in  ten 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  37 

terminating  its  flight  on  their  side  of  the  net.  So  it  was  that,  not  very 
long  after  they  were  threatened  with  a  lost  set,  the  score  was  called  at 
4-all.  It  was  Bundy's  service  in  the  ninth  game  and  the  terrific  twist 
he  succeeded  in  imparting  to  it  made  the  ball  slide  off  at  various  angles 
from  his  opponents'  rackets  for  an  easy  game.  Alexander  followed,  and 
the  challengers,  for  the  first  and  only  time  in  the  match,  were  within  a 
point  of  a  set.  At  15/40,  a  service  ace,  followed  by  a  netted  return  and 
two  kills  by  Hackett  at  the  net,  evened  the  score  again,  and  the  set  finally 
ended  at  8/6.  The  third  and  final  set  was  short-lived.  With  two  sets 
won  the  title  holders  evidently  felt  they  could  well  afford  the  liberty  of  a 
little  recklessness  and  the  result  was  an  attack  which,  for  its  severity,  has 
rarely  been  equalled  in  any  important  match.  Alexander's  forehand  fairly 
whistled  as  it  flew  by  and  occasionally  at  his  luckless  opponents.  The 
latter  were  compelled  to  remain  entirely  on  the  defensive,  and  though  their 
constant  loblnng,  high  and  deep  as  it  was,  saved  what  otherwise  would 
have  been  an  earlier  defeat,  it,  too,  in  the  end  proved  of  little  avail,  for 
Hackett's  smashing  was  faultless.  His  peculiar  stroke,  made  with  a  flat 
racket  and  his  last  ounce  behind  it,  never  varied,  and  the  result  was  like- 
wise unchangeable,  for  the  ball  never  came  back. 
The  score  of  the  match  was  6/1,  8/6,  6/3. 


MISS  HAZEL  HOTCHKISS, 
National  Champion,   1909  and  1910. 


SrALDlNGS   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Women's  National  Championship 

Both  in  play  and  in  class  of  entries  the  Twenty-tifth  Annual  Women's 
Championship,  which  was  begun  on  June  20  on  the  courts  of  the  Phila- 
delphia Cricket  Club,  fell  below  the  standard  of  a  year  ago.  Miss  Hazel 
Hotchkiss,  the  holder,  came  on  from  San  Francisco  to  defend  the  title  which 
she  won  a  year  earlier,  and  although  her  challenger.  Miss  Louise  E.  Ham- 
mond, put  up  a  much  stronger  game  than  had  Mrs.  Barger  Wallach  in  1909, 
Miss  liotchkiss'  play  was  decidedly  more  erratic  than  it  had  been  on  the 
former  occasion.  Unusual  heat  was  a  disagreeable  feature  of  the  week,  and 
it  w-as  not  until  Friday  that  a  cool  wave  alleviated  this  disagreeable  con- 
dition. Among  the  names  missing  in  the  entry  list  were  those  of  Mrs. 
Barger  Wallach  and  Miss  Evelyn  Sears,  champions  of  1907  and  1908, 
respectively,  and  there  were  others  from  New  York  and  Boston,  who, 
though  less  notable,  had  added  much  to  the  interest  of  the  tournament  in 
past  seasons. 

In  the  third  round  Miss  Lois  Moyes  of  Toronto  and  Miss  Green  of 
Philadelphia  were  eliminated.  Miss  Wildey  was  the  vanquisher  of  Miss 
Moyes,  and  although  the  winner  was  conceded  only  a  slight  chance  when 
the  match  began,  her  play  was  of  the  caliber  which  promised  great  things 
in  future.  Miss  Moyes  failed  to  score  a  set,  and  was  defeated,  6/3,  6/4. 
Miss  Browning  was  the  cause  of  Miss  Green's  troubles  in  this  round,  and 
although  the  latter  managed  to  win  the  first  set  she  fell  off  badly  in  the 
second  and  third. 

On  Thursday  the  feature  match  was  that  in  which  Miss  Hammond  faced 
Miss  Edith  Rotch,  of  Boston,  in  the  upper  semi-final  bracket.  Miss  Ham- 
mond, however,  proved  far  too  strong  and  steady  a  player  for  her  Eastern 
rival,  and  the  match  was  won  in  straight  sets,  7/5,  6/2.  The  remaining 
match  of  the  day  was  a  closely  fought  battle  between  Miss  Browning  and 
Miss  Wildey.  Miss  Browning  won  the  first  set  in  short  order  at  6/1,  Miss 
Wildey  during  that  period  apparently  being  unable  to  get  any  sort  of 
control  of  her  strokes.  In  the  second  set,  after  running  into  a  lead  of 
3/0  and  later  of  4/1,  Miss  Browning  eased  her  game  considerably,  and 
Miss  Wildey  evened  the  score  at  4-all.  The  former  then  renewed  the  speed 
of  her  shots,  and  in  the  last  two  games  Miss  Wildey  was  forced  on  the 
defensive,   at   which  she  could   hardly  hope   for  a  favorable  result. 

The  final  was  a  one-sided  affair  with  fortune  always  on  Miss  Hammond's 
side  of  the  net.  Miss  Browning's  weak  backhand  was  made  the  target  of 
the  majority  of  Miss  Hammond's  stinging  drives,  and  there  was  never  a 
moment  of  doubt  as  to  the  final  outcome.  Throughout  the  two  sets  Miss 
Hammond  played  consistently,  and  placed  so  well  that  she  did  comparatively 
little  running.  In  the  second  set  Miss  Browning,  because  of  Miss  Ham- 
mond's determination  not  to  exert  herself  unnecessarily,  got  to  4/5,  but  it 
was  her  last  stand  of  the  match. 

The  challenge  round,  played  on  Saturday  afternoon,  June  25,  found  con- 
ditions for  tennis  ideal.  The  heat  had  lessened  perceptibly,  and  a  record- 
breaking  crowd  took  the  trip  to  St,  Martin's  to  see  what  effect  the  admit- 
tedly best  racket  wielder  of  the  East  would  make  on  the  remarkable 
California  girl's  came.  It  was  shortly  after  three  o'clock  when  play  began, 
and  the  service  fell  to  Miss  Hammond's  lot.  This  fact  did  not  prove  an 
advantage  to  the  challenger,  for  Miss  Hotchkiss,  by  deep  driving  to  her 
opponent's  backhand,  won  the  game.  The  tide  changed  at  this  point,  when 
through  a  series  of  outs  and  nets  by  the  Californian,  Miss  Hammond  was 
enabled  to  jump  into  a  lead  of  3/1.  Miss  Hotchkiss  got  going  better  then, 
and  by  hard,  deep  driving,  soon  had  Miss  Hammond  on  the  run.  The 
former    came    into    the   net   oftener,    and   with    this   style    of    play    the    lead 


40  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

changed  to  Miss  Hotchkiss  at  4/3.  The  eighth  game  was  very  close.  Miss 
Hammond  got  to  30/40  on  Miss  Hotchkiss'  serve,  but  the  latter  saved  it  by 
a  fast  drive  to  Miss  Hammond's  forehand.  Two  successive  shots  to  the 
latter's  backhand  resulted  in  short  lobs,  and  Miss  Hotchkiss  killed  both, 
thereby  making  the  score  in  her  favor  5/3.  Miss  Hammond  won  her 
service  in  the  next  game,  and  even  got  an  advantage  in  the  tenth,  but  here 
again  the  champion  rose  to  the  occasion,  and,  by  taking  a  net  position,  won 
three  successive  points  and  the  first  set,  6/4. 

The  second  set  was  not  as  close  as  its  predecessor.  Miss  Hotchkiss  took 
the  net  oftener,  and  by  splendid  smashing  soon  ran  the  score  up  to  4/1  in 
her  favor.  In  the  next  game  she  made  faulty  returns  of  Miss  Hammond's 
service,  and  the  latter  took  advantage  of  it  for  her  second  game  in  the 
set.  The  last  two  games  were  played  in  whirlwind  fashion  by  the  title- 
holder.  For  the  first  time  her  challenger  was  really  outclassed,  and  a 
series  of  sharp  drives  to  Miss  Hammond's  backhand  decided  the  champion- 
ship for  the  second  time  in  favor  of  Miss  Hotchkiss. 

Miss  Hotchkiss  paired  with  Miss  Rotch  in  the  doubles,  and  here  again 
she  was  successful,  although  in  the  first  round  she  and  her  partner  struck 
Tarters  in  Miss  Moves  and  Miss  Green.  It  was  the  best  contest  of  the 
tournament,  and  was  only  won  by  the  close  score  of  10/8,  6/4.  In  the 
final  the  winners  faced  Miss  Browning  and  Miss  Wildey,  and  the  score  in 
their   favor  went  in   two   setSj   each   at  6/4. 

J.  R.  Carpenter,  Jr.,  and  Miss  Hotchkiss  proved  the  best  of  the  mixed 
doubles  teams  entered,  and  none  of  their  opponents  were  successful  in 
winning  a  set  from  them.  In  the  final  they  disposed  of  Miss  Wildey  and 
H.  M.  Tilden  at  6/2.  6/2. 

In  the  men's  event,  which  is  always  run  in  conjunction  with  the  women's 
championship,  Tilden  and  Carpenter  came  together  in  the  final  round,  and, 
while  the  match  produced  really  excellent  tennis,  Tilden  throughout  the 
three  sets  held  the  upper  hand.     The  summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Preliminary  National  Doubles 

On  August  2  the  first  match  to  decide  the  challengers  of  F.  B.  Alexander 
and  H.  H.  Hackett,  the  doubles  champions,  was  played  on  the  Onwentsia 
Club's  courts  at  Chicago.  Again,  as  was  the  case  last  year,  four  sections 
sent  teams  to  compete  for  this  honor.  Two  of  these  were  the  result  of  most 
remarkable  form  reversals  in  their  respective  tournaments. .  T.  C.  Bundy 
and  T.  W.  Hendrick,  from  California,  journeyed  to  Chicago  after  having 
upset  all  calculations  in  the  Pacilic  Coast  Doubles  Championship  by  dis- 
posing of  the  young  international  team,  M.  E.  McLoughlin  and  M.  H. 
Long.  The  other  unexpected  combination  came  from  Longwood,  where 
the  Eastern  Doubles  Tournament  had  produced  one  upset  after  the  other. 
With  such  a  team  as  Wright  and  Little  competing  at  Longwood  it  seemed 
strange  indeed  to  have  a  youthful  pair  in  the  persons  of  E.  H.  Whitney 
and  R.  Bishop  represent  the  strongest  tennis  section  of  the  country.  Paul 
Gardner  and  L.  H.  Waidner  were  the  Western  representativs,  while  from 
the  South  came  the  Doyle  brothers,  C.  B.  and  H.  E.  The  first  match 
began  at  2  o'clock,  under  ideal  weather  conditions.  It  brought  together 
Waidner  and  Gardner  and  the  Doyles.  The  latter  have  played  together  for 
many  years  and  their  chances  of  success  were  considered  rather  better 
than  Waidner's  and  Gardner's.  However,  their  play  was  very  disappoint- 
ing, being  at  times  brilliant  but,  for  the  most  part,  woefully  weak.  They 
were  very  erratic,  and,  on  their  ground  strokes,  no  match  for  their  oppo- 
nents. The  latters'  steadiness  and  excellent  lobbing  compelled  them  to 
remain  much  of  the  time  in  the  back  court,  and,  probably  due  to  the  fact 
that  they  could  not  reach  the  net,  they  were  defeated  in  straight  sets,  6/3, 
6/4,  6/3.  As  soon  as  that  match  had  been  concluded  the  one  between 
Hendrick  and  Bundy  and  Whitney  and  liishop  was  begun.  The  latter 
started  well  and  by  very  steady  play  ran  out  the  first  set,  6/4.  Their  win 
caused  very  general  surprise,  for  no  one  conceded  them  much  of  a  chance 
against  their  older  rivals.  The  second  set  was  quite  close,  but  at  5/4 
Bundy  succeeded  in  winning  a  love  game  with  his  sharp  twisting  service. 
The  third  set  was  the  fastest  of  the  five  played.  The  Californians  started 
in  to  rush,  and  by  taking  the  net  constantly,  soon  had  the  Eastern  cham- 
pions entirely  on  the  defensive.  The  only  game  they  won  in  the  set  was 
on  Bishop's  service,  when,  by  clever  placing,  he  forced  Bundy  and  Hend- 
rick to  pass  up  weak  returns  to  Whitney  at  the  net.  The  fourth  set  was  a 
great  reversal  for  the  Western  combination.  Whitney  and  Bishop  started 
in  at  a  terrific  clip,  and,  in  less  time  than  it  takes  to  tell,  ran  the  score  up 
to  4/0.  Hendrick  won  his  service  at  that  point,  but  the  next  game  went  to 
the  Longwood  winners,  giving  them  a  lead  of  5/1.  The  Coast  players  then 
made  a  great  stand,  and  after  forcing  the  next  three  games,  lost  the  tenth 
on  Whitney's  service  and  the  set,  6/4.  Bundy's  service  started  the  fifth 
set,  and  he  won  it  easily.  Whitney's  came  next,  but  after  serving  two 
double  faults,  he  dropped  his  game.  Hendrick  increased  the  lead  to  3/0, 
and  from  that  point  on  there  was  little  doubt  as  to  the  ultimate  conclusion 
of  the  match.  Bishop  won  his  game,  making  the  score  4/1,  and  a  few 
minutes  later  Whitney  did  likewise.  The  final  score  was  6/2.  A  high 
wind  made  playing  conditions  rather  unfavorable  the  following  day,  when 
the  final  match  was  played  between  Bundy  and  Hendrick  and  Gardner  and 
Waidner.  It  took  some  time  for  the  men  to  gauge  the  strength  of  their 
shots,  and  in  the  first  few  games,  many  balls,  which,  under  ordinary  con- 
ditions would  have  dropped  in,  were  carried  out  of  the  court  by  the  wind. 
The  first  set  was  very  even.  At  5/4  the  Westerners  were  twice  within 
a  point  of  winning  the  set,  but  a  brilliant  smash  of  Bundy's  evened  the 
score.  Waidner's  serve  followed,  and  aided  by  a  double  fault  from  Bundy, 
together  with  two  weak  returns  by   Hendrick,  the   Westerners  took  the  first 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  43 

set,  7/5.  With  their  own  service  to  start  the  second  set,  the  Chicagoans' 
chance  seemed  a  very  good  one,  but  Gardner  lost  his  service  and,  when 
Bundy  won  his,  the  lead  thereby  afforded  the  Coast  men  was  never  over- 
come, and  the  latter  evened  the  set  score  by  winning  the  second,  6/4.  The 
third  set  was  very  close  up  to  3-all,  but  at  that  point  the  Californians  tried 
many  shots,  all  of  which  were  successful,  and  jumped  into  the  lead  at  5/3. 
Waidner  won  his  service  again  then,  but  Bundy's  was  equally  strong,  and 
the  third  set  ended  exactly  as  had  the  second.  The  fourth  set  was  all  the 
Californians',  for  after  2-all  Waidner  and  Gardner  were  forced  to  play  a 
defensive  game,  which,  against  Bundy's  splendid  overhead  work  and  Hend- 
rick's  steadiness,  was  little  better  than  useless.  The  ninth  game  of  the  set 
was  very  closely  contested,  but,  after  getting  to  deuce,  Gardner  volleyed 
into  the  net  and  wound  up  the  match  with  a  double  fault. 


SrALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  45 


First  Clay  Court  Championship 

A  new  and  most  important  event  was  inaugurated  in  1910,  wlien,  largely- 
through  the  efforts  of  Dr.  P.  B.  Hawk  and  other  Western  experts,  a  clay 
court  championship  was  established.  This  tournament  was  begun  on  August 
I  on  the  courts  of  the  Omaha  Field  Club.  An  entry  list  in  excess  of  100 
crowned  the  efforts  of  the  management  of  this  tournament,  and  prominent 
men  both  from  the  East  and  Pacific  Slope  were  guests  of  the  club  during 
the  week.  From  every  standpoint  this  first  championship  was  successful. 
The  crowds  estimated  on  the  day  of  the  finals  of  singles  and  doubles  were 
in  the  neighborhood  of  5,000,  and  at  no  event  played  throughout  the  year 
was  a  greater  or  more  general  interest  shown.  There  was  a  good  deal  of 
speculation  on  the  degree  of  success  those  interested  in  this  event  would 
attain,  but  when  all  was  over  the  general  consensus  of  opinion  was  that  no- 
tournament  had  proved  a  more  popular  or,  from  the  player's  standpoint^ 
a  more  successful  one.  It  so  happened  that  the  draw  was  very  evenly 
divided,  so  far  as  the  strength  of  the  better  men  was  concerned,  although 
it  was  a  foregone  conclusion  that  Melville  H.  Long,  who  had  traveled  from 
San  Francisco,  would  in  all  likelihood  win  the  championship.  Long  was 
in  the  lower  half,  together  with  the  veteran,  F.  G.  Anderson,  and  in  the 
upper  half  were  W.  M.  Hall,  of  New  York;  W.  T.  Hayes,  one  of  Chicago's 
foremost  players,  and  the  president  of  the  new  Clay  Court  Association, 
Dr.  P.  B.  Hawk. 

There  were  no  matches  of  great  importance  played  in  the  first  round, 
Anderson,  Hall,  Hawk,  Barton  and  Long  all  coming  through  without  any 
difficulty.  In  the  second  round  Drummond  Jones  of  St.  Louis  disposed  of 
J.  T.  Bailey  of  Oklahoma  in  what  proved  to  be  the  most  interesting- 
match  of  that  bracket.  Bailey  played  very  well  under  the  circumstances, 
but  after  capturing  the  second  set,  6/4,  was  unequal  to  the  strain  required 
of  him  and  lost  the  deciding  one,  6/3.  The  first  unexpected  result  of  the 
tournament  was  when  John  Barton  of  Sioux  Falls  defeated  Dr.  Hawk  in  a 
very  close  match,  but  Hawk,  after  coming  close  to  a  win  in  the  second  set, 
dropped  it,  7/5,  and  thereafter  trailed  Barton  for  the  remainder  of  the 
match.  In  the  same  round  Anderson  defeated  Scribner  in  a  rather  close 
match,  while  Hall  experienced  considerable  difficulty  in  disposing  of  the 
promising  young  Westerner,  Armstrong,  in  three  fast  sets.  Long  met  and 
won  from  C.  Potter  with  the  same  ease  with  which  he  had  won  his 
previous  matches.  In  the  fourth  round  the  matches  were  three  out 
of  five  sets.  In  the  upper  half  Hayes'  speed  proved  too  much  for  Barton 
and  the  former  won  in  straight  sets.  Hall  was  the  other  winner  in  the 
upper  half,  while  in  the  lower  Jones  played  a  great  five-set  match  with 
Branson.  Branson  was  outclassed  in  the  first  set  and  failed  to  win  a  game. 
In  the  second,  Jones,  possibly  over-confident,  was  outsteadied,  Branson 
winning  at  6/4.  In  the  third  set  Jones  again  won  without  the  loss  of  a  game^ 
and  after  coming  within  a  point  of  the  fourth  was  finally  deprived  of  it 
because  of  Branson's  accuracy  after  twenty-two  games  had  been  played. 
The  fifth  set  was  very  even,  but  Jones  lasted  better,  winning  finally  at  7/5. 

What  proved  the  most  interesting  match  of  the  tournament  was  that 
in  which  Long  vanquished  F.  G.  Anderson,  thereby  winning  his  place  in 
the  lower  semi-final.  Anderson's  great  experience,  strength  and  steadiness 
were  supposed  to  concede  him  at  least  a  chance  with  his  remarkably 
brilliant  young  opponent.  From  the  standpoint  of  a  contest,  however,  it 
was  ridiculously  one-sided.  Anderson  was  steady  enough  and  his  ground 
strokes  fast  and  accurate,  but  Long  played  a  really  wonderful  game.  At 
the  net  or  in  the  back  court  he  played  a  better  game  than  the  Easterner, 
while   his  generalship   was   infinitely   better.     Anderson   relied   wholly   upon 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  47 

his  driving,  but  his  service  was  so  weak  that  he  failed  to  follow  it  in,  and 
in  the  majority  of  instances  the  point  ended  on  Long's  tirst  return.  Long, 
on  the  other  hand,  had  a  splendid  delivery,  which  he  followed  to  the  net. 
It  was  so  fast  that  Anderson's  returns  were  often  very  weak  and  Long 
volleyed  or  smashed  for  a  kill.  The  entire  match  consumed  exactly  nine- 
teen minutes.  Long  winning  by  the  one-sided  score  of  6/3,  6/0,  6/1.  In 
the  semi-tinals  Hall  ended  the  aspirations  of  Hayes  after  four  fairly 
close  sets.  The  latter's  forehand  drive  was  very  good  and  Hall  apparently 
could  not  keep  the  ball  from  the  Westerner's  reach.  The  latter  won  the 
first  set,  6/4.  In  the  second  set  the  New  Yorker  directed  his  efforts  prin- 
cipally to  Hayes'  backhand,  which  was  quite  weak.  By  playing  it  deep 
in  the  corners  and  running  in.  Hall  had  innumerable  opportunities  at  the 
net,  and,  making  the  most  of  them,  ran  out  the  following  three  sets,  6/3, 
6/4,  6/j.  This  match  was  considered  by  many  to  be  in  the  nature  of  an 
upset,  but  it  was  really  the  result  of  Hall's  better  generalship.  In  the 
lower  half  Jones  succeeded  in  making  the  best  stand  against  Long  of  any 
of  the  latter's  opponents.  Long  was  not  quite  as  severe  in  this  match  as 
in  his  others,  but  nevertheless  maintained  a  safe  lead  throughout  the 
three  sets.  The  score  was  6/4,  6/4,  6/3.  While  disappointing  in  many 
respects,  the  final  between  Long  and  Hall  was  well  worth  seeing,  if  for  no 
other  reason  than  witnessing  Long's  wonderful  skill.  Hall  was  hopelessly 
outclassed,  and,  in  the  three  sets,  succeeded  in  winning  but  two  games. 
During  the  match,  which  was  but  little  longer  lived  than  the  Long-Ander- 
son one.  Hall  tried  everything  he  knew  to  change  the  tide  of  battle.  It 
was  all  useless,  however,  for  no  matter  what  he  tried  Long  more  than 
equalled  him  on  any  sort  of  a  shot.  The  principal  difference  was  the 
speed  which  Long  succeeded  in  attaining.  His  returns,  all  lightning  fast, 
were  surer  even  than  Hall's  slower  shots.  Toward  the  end  of  the  match 
the  Easterner  resorted  to  high  lobs,  but  these  had  as  little  effect  as  any 
other  stroke  he  attempted,  and  the  last  five  points  of  the  match  were 
earned  by   Long  on  terrific   smashes.     The  score  was  6/0,   6/1,   6/1. 

There  was  considerably  more  competition  in  the  doubles  than  in  the 
singles,  no  team  being  as  superior  in  this  event  as  Long  was  to  the  rest 
of  the  field  in  singles.  Again  the  draw  was  a  very  even  one,  the  two 
strongest  teams  being  the  Anderson  and  Hayes  combination  and  Long  and 
Scribner.  True  to  form,  they  came  through  their  respective  halves,  and 
this  time  the  spectators  were  treated  to  a  fight  which  lasted  the  full  five 
sets.  In  the  first  two.  Long  and  Scribner  had  all  the  better  of  it,  winning 
at  6/2,  6/3.  In  the  third,  however,  Hayes  and  Anderson  ran  six  consecu- 
tive games.  They  continued  their  winning  streak  in  the  fourth  set,  in 
which  they  led  safely  throughout,  and  in  the  fifth  they  again  took  com- 
mand and  won,  6/2.  Long  was  decidedly  off  in  this  match,  and  did  not 
approach  the  form  he  displayed  throughout  the  singles.  Scribner  more 
than  upheld  his  end,  while  Anderson  and  Hayes,  though  by  no  means  a 
brilliant  combination,  played  a  steady,  accurate  game.  The  match  was 
played  immediately  after  the  final  singles,  and  Long's  poor  game  may  be 
attributed  to  a  reaction  from  his  match  with  Hall.  Anderson  proved  the 
most  resourceful  and  cleverest  of  the  four.  He  could  be  depended  on  for 
all  his  returns,  and  with  an  occasional  brilliant  streak  from  his  partner, 
Hayes,  was  more  than  a  match  for  the  losers.  To  demonstrate  the  interest 
taken  in  this  match,  it  is  worthy  of  note  that  when  play  began  6,000  people 
were  on  hand  to  witness  it.     The  summaries:

Intercollegiate  Championship 

R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.  of  Yale  won  the  thirtieth  intercollegiate  tennis  cham- 
pionship tournament,  which  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Merion  Cricket 
Club   on   September  7   and   following  days. 

In  the  first  round  the  greatest  surprise  of  the  tournament  occurred, 
when  Sweetser  of  Harvard  defeated  Dean  Mathey  of  Princeton  in  an 
interesting  four-set  match.  Neither  of  the  men  played  a  fast  game  and 
Mathey  was  more   or  less  erratic.     The   score   was  6/4,   3/6,   6/1,  6/2. 

The  final  match,  between  Holden  and  Sweetser,  was  a  good  exhibition 
of  fast  play  and  headwork.  In  the  end  Holden  won  by  his  clever  tactics, 
by   the    score   of  3/6,  6/3,   6/2,   8/6. 

Dean  Mathey  and  B.  N.  Dell  of  Princeton  won  the  doubles  champion- 
ship, defeating  Evans  and  Goodhue  of  Yale  in  the  final  round.  Although 
the  match  only  lasted  three  sets,  it  was  much  closer  than  the  score  indi- 
cates.    The  summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  55 


Lon^wood  Singles  and  Eastern  Doubles 

Longwood,  for  many  years  the  scene  of  the  greatest  tournament  of  the 
season,  with  the  exception  of  the  .championship,  has  never  in  its  thirty-one 
years  of  play  had  a  more  interesting  tournament  than  the  one  which, 
began  on  Monday,  July  18,  or  for  that  matter,  one  in  which  the  unex- 
pected and  unlooked-for  proved  so  dominating  a  factor.  For  the  first 
time  a  Californian  representative  took  part.  M.  E.  McLoughlin  arrived, 
from  the  Coast  the  day  before  the  tournament  started,  and  ])rovided  the 
most  sensational  tennis  during  the  week  of  any  that  had  up  to  that  time 
been  i)layed  in  the  East.  In  wretched  form  when  the  event  began,  he 
gradually  rounded  into  shape,  until  he  had  reached  a  point  which  he  at 
no  time  approached  during  the  remainder  of  his  stay  in  this  section  of 
the  country.  As  usual,  Longwood  attracted  all  the  better  men  with  the 
exception  of  Long,  Bundj'  and  Alexander,  who  were  unable  to  make  the 
trip,  and  W.  J.  Clothier,  who,  through  illness,  remained  out  of  competition 
throughout  the   season. 

Unlike  many  big  events,  Longwood  is  never  seeded,  and  in  consequence 
the  possibility  of  an  uneven  draw  materialized  with  a  vengeance.  In  the 
upper  half  were  1?.  C.  Wright,  McLoughlin,  N.  W.  Niles,  C.  R.  Gardner, 
G.  F.  Touchard  and  R.  II.  I'almer,  while  in  the  lower  Dean  Mathey,  W. 
F.  Johnson  and  R.  D.  Little  comjjrised  the  strength  of  their  section.  In 
the  first  round  there  were  several  good  matches,  the  best  being  that 
between  R.  II.  Palmer  and  F.  C.  Inman.  Both  men  are  left-handed,  and 
both  play  with  great  speed.  Errors  were  numerous  and  so  were  aces,  so 
that  the  match  was  decidedly  interesting.  Palmer  proved  a  little  better 
than  Inman,  however,  and  won  in  four  sets.  In  the  third  round,  by  far 
the  best  match  was  that  played  between  Niles  and  Wright.  Each  man 
was  at  the  top  of  his  game,  but  Niles  took  considerably  longer  to  swings 
into  his  stride.  Wright,  by  harder,  headier  play,  ran  out  the  first  two 
sets,  both  at  6/3,  but  in  the  third  Niles  braced  remarkably,  and,  despite 
Wright's  accuracy  and  best  efforts,  ran  out  the  set.  6/4.  The  fourth 
started  badly  for  the  ex-intercollegiate  champion  and  Wright  soon  piled  up 
a  lead  of  5/1.  At  this  point  he  became  a  little  careless,  and  Niles,  taking: 
full  advantage  of  his  opponent's  over-confidence,  ran  four  successive 
games.  Wright  served  then,  winning  his  game  and  coming  four  times 
within  a  point  of  the  next.  On  each  occasion  Niles  volleyed  for  an  ace 
and  ultimately  took  the  game  on  a  backhand  drive,  which  beat  Wright  by 
yards  as  the  latter  tried  to  come  in.  It  was  Niles'  last  stand,  however,, 
for  after  making  several  costly  errors  Wright  passed  him  twice  for  the 
points  necessary  to  win  the  match.  In  the  following  round  Wright  easily 
won  from  Palmer  in  straight  sets,  and  McLoughlin  beat  his  old  team-mate, 
C.  R.  Gardner,  after  the  latter  had  come  twice  within  a  point  of  winning 
the  match  in  straight  sets.  Gardner  played  very  well  during  the  first  two 
sets.  His  service  was  very  severe  and  once  in  each  set  he  succeeded  in 
breaking  through  McLoughlin's.  In  the  third  set  he  broke  through 
McLoughlin's  service  twice,  thereby  taking  the  lead  of  5/3,  but  with  his 
own  service  to  follow  and  the  match  apparently  in  hand,  he  weakened 
badly.  A  double,  followed  by  a  net  court  stroke,  gave  McLoughlin  his 
chance  and  he  was  quick  to  take  advantage  of  it.  He  won  his  own  ser- 
vice, and  finally  the  set,  10/8.  Gardner  made  little  effort  in  the  fourth, 
which  McLoughlin  won  at  love.  And  in  the  fifth  the 'latter  was  going  so 
strongly  that  Gardner,  who  had  gradually  been  easing  his  stroke,  was 
never   dangerous.      The   final  set   was   6/3. 

In  the  same  round  the  greatest  surprise  in  the  tournament  was  Little's 
defeat  at  the  hands  of  Dean  Mathey.  Little  played  very  badly.  He  was 
unsteady    and    showed    his    lack    of   practice,    while    on    the-  other    hand    the; 


56  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

young  Princetonian  outdid  himself.  Throughout  the  match  long  rallies 
preceded  each  point  and  usually  ended  with  an  error  by  Little.  The  score 
■was  very  close,  Mathey  winning,  6/0,  6/8,  6/4,  10/8.  The  fifth  round, 
for  one  so  advanced  in  the  tournament,  produced  very  little  in  the  way  of 
good  tennis.  In  the  upper  half  Beals  Wright  had  little  difficulty  in  win- 
ning in  straight  sets  from  F.  J.  Sulloway,  and  McLoughlin  put  out  G.  F. 
Touchard  with  equal  ease.  In  the  lower  half  W.  F.  Johnson  won  in 
four  sets  from  G.  M.  Church,  and,  to  the  surprise  of  every  one,  A.  S. 
Dabney,  Jr.,  put  Mathey  out  of  the  running.  The  semi-finals  were  decided 
the  following  day.  Johnson,  as  anticipated,  won  from  Dabney,  but  in 
spite  of  all  calculations  and  reasons  advanced  for  Wright's  success  against 
McLoughlin,  the  latter  outplayed  the  ex-champion  and  beat  him  in  four 
fast  sets.  Wright  struck  his  gait  first,  and  by  chopping  low,  hard  balls  to 
McLoughlin's  backhand,  ran  out  the  opening  set,  6/4.  In  the  second  the 
Bostonian  held  his  own  until  the  set  was  nearly  over,  when  unexpectedly 
he  dropped  his  service  and  thereby  gave  McLoughlin  an  advantage  of  one 
game.  The  latter  was  winning  his  service  with  great  ease,  while  against 
Wright's  he  was  gradually  accomplishing  a  little  better  results  as  play 
progressed.  At  5-all  he  won  his  own  service  and  then  Wright's  for  the 
set.  The  third  was  a  repetition  of  the  second.  Neither  man  had  any 
advantage  until  the  score  reached  6-all,  when,  for  the  second  time, 
McLoughlin  won  his  own  delivery  and  broke  through  Wright's.  At  that 
stage  in  the  match  his  condition  was  very  much  better  than  Wright's,  and 
it  was  obvious  that  the  latter  could  not  last  throughout  five  sets.  McLough- 
lin realizing  this,  too,  added  to  the  speed  of  his  game  and  had  Wright 
running  around  the  court  continuously.  The  end  came  at  4-all,  when 
McLoughlin  succeeded  in  keeping  Wright  back  from  the  net  on  the  latter's 
service  and  taking  it  himself.  Throughout  the  match  McLoughlin  played 
a  magnificent  game.  He  was  fast  as  lightning  on  service  and  overhead, 
and  volleyed  with  a  certainty  and  speed  which  Wright  at  his  best  never 
excelled.  In  only  one  point  was  the  latter  superior  to  the  Californian, 
and  that  was  on  ground  strokes.  McLoughlin  was  a  little  unsteady  on 
return  of  service,  but  Wright's  chop,  which  he  has  developed  to  a  remark- 
able  degree,   was   as  accurate   as   usual. 

The  challenge  round  was  played  on  Monday,  July  25,  in  intense  heat 
and  before  a  crowd  numbering  3,000.  The  warming  up  was  short-lived  and 
in  a  very  few  minutes  Larned  served  and  the  match  was  on.  McLoughlin 
took  chances  in  the  first  game  and  made  three  successive  aces,  winning  the 
game  at  15.  He  followed  it  up  by  taking  his  own  service  with  three 
clean  service  aces.  It  was  a  spurt,  however,  which  lasted  only  for  two 
games,  for  Larned,  warming  rapidly,  reeled  off  game  after  game  until 
the  set  ended  in  his  favor  at  6/2.  The  latter  had  become  very  strong  and 
served  more  aces  than  McLoughlin,  as  well  as  outplaying  him  in  every 
other  department  of  the  game.  In  the  second  set  McLoughlin  started 
better,  and  at  2-all,  broke  through  Larned's  delivery.  He  followed  it  by 
winning  his  own  and  thereby  taking  a  lead  which  Larned  was  unable  to 
overcome.  McLoughlin  won  the  set,  6/4.  The  third  set  took  but  a  few 
minutes.  Larned,  realizing  the  strength  of  his  young  opponent,  played  with 
such  speed  that  McLoughlin  was  completely  overwhelmed.  Try  as  he 
would  McLoughlin  could  do  nothing  to  stem  Larned's  onslaught,  and  suc- 
ceeded in  winning  but  a  single  game,  the  second,  on  his  own  service.  In 
that  set  Larned  remained  the  greater  part  of  the  time  in  the  back  court  and 
allowed  McLoughlin  to  take  the  net  whenever  he  chose.  Once  there  the 
Californian  was  almost  invariably  passed,  and  in  the  entire  set  Larned 
made  but  five  errors.  At  the  completion  of  the  third  set  a  thunder  shower, 
which  had  been  threatening,  broke  forth,  and  an  interval  of  more  than  an 
hour  elapsed  before  play  was  again  resumed.  This  unusual  rest,  however, 
did  not  help  McLoughlin  to  any  great  extent,  although  he  put  up  a  much 
better  fight  than  earlier  in  the  match.  Larned,  too,  was  much  fresher,  and 
came  oftener  to  the  net  than  he  had  in  the  earlier  stages  of  the  match.     It

was  an  even  thing  up  to  3-all,  each  man  winning  his  service.  Lamed  won 
the  seventh  gann,  on  his  own  delivery  and  suddenly  cut  forth  a  series  of 
shots  which  completely  smothered  the  San  F'ranciscan's  defense.  In  the 
last  three  games  the  latter  failed  to  score  a  point,  and  in  the  last  two 
Larned  made  a  total  of  7  aces,  6  on  drives,  which  McLoughlin  could  not 
even  get  near,  and  the  seventh  on  a  volley,  which  just  rolled  over  after 
striking  the  net-cord.     The  summaries:

The  doubles,  representative  always,  was  no  exception  this  year,  as  many 
strong  teams  competed.  In  the  first  round  the  only  match  of  importance 
was    that    played    between    H.    J.    Holt    and    H.    I.    Foster    against    C.    R. 


MISS  MAY  SUTTON. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL..  o9^ 

Gardner  and  G.  F.  Touchard.  The  former  team  were  far  below  the  stan- 
dard which  they  had  reached  a  year  previous,  and  lost  in  three  straight 
sets.  A  rather  unfortunate  position  in  the  draw  brought  together  what 
everyone  considered  the  two  strongest  teams  in  the  first  round — Beals  C. 
Wright  and  R.  D.  Little,  and  W.  A.  Larned  and  G.  L.  Wrenn,  Jr.  The 
match,  however,  proved  extremely  interesting.  Wright,  who  had  just 
arrived  from  England,  was  far  from  being  at  the  top  of  his  game,  but 
Little,  for  the  first  time  in  the  season,  played  as  everyone  knows  him  to 
be  capable  of  playing.  This  fact,  combined  with  more  or  less  of  uncer- 
tainty in  Larned's  work,  determined  the  result.  Wrenn's  defensive  game 
without  Larned's  aggressive  play  to  back  it  up,  was  ineffective  against  the 
opposing  pair  and  Little  and  Wright  won  in  straight  sets  at  9/7,  7/5,  6/4. 
In  the  same  round  Dabney  and  Niles  met  rather  unusually  strong  resist- 
ance from  W.  A.  Carl  and  W.  F.  Kice,  and  Touchard  and  Gardner  just 
managed  to  pull  out  a  five-set  match  from  R.  C.  Seaver  and  G.  T.  Putnam, 
the  last  set  of  the  match  going  to  7/5.  There  was  only  one  straight  set 
match  in  the  third  round,  all  the  rest  being  more  or  less  even.  In  the  top 
half  E.  H.  Whitney  and  R.  Bishop  played  five  hard  sets  with  G.  Reals  and 
A.  Sweetser.  R.  A.  Ilolden  and  F.  AI.  Watrous  on  the  lower  side  of  the 
draw  had  a  warm  engagement  with  G.  F.  Wales  and  W.  E.  Porter,  and 
an  unexpected  result  came  in  the  defeat  of  A.  S.  Dabney,  Jr.,  and  N.  W. 
Niles  at  the  hands  of  S.  P.  Ware  and  N.  B.  Ilallowell.  The  losers  were 
decidedly  off,  and  their  team-work,  which  has  invariably  been  so  potent  a 
factor  of  their  success,  was  on  this  occasion  wretched.  Niles  particularly 
was  unsteady  and  the  constant  high  lobbing  of  the  winners  ultimately  threw 
him  completely  off  in  his  overhead  play.  It  was  in  this  round  that  a 
remarkable  upset  came  about  when  R.  D.  Little  and  B.  C.  Wright  went 
down  after  five  sets  before  Touchard  and  Gardner.  The  latter  played  a 
remarkable  game  and  the  rather  careless  way  in  which  Wright  and  Little 
started  gave  them  an  opportunity  of  which  they  took  full  advantage. 
Neither  of  the  internationalists  reached  the  form  in  which  they  usually  play, 
while  on  the  other  hand  it  was  very  generally  conceded  that  the  winners 
struck  a  streak  away  above  their  heads.  The  first  set  was  very  close,  but 
at  4/3  Touchard  dropped  his  service  game  and  a  moment  later  Gardner  did 
likewise.  In  the  second  set  the  ex-Californian  tried  and  succeeded  in  get- 
ting away  with  many  difficult  chances.  The  same  thing  was  true  of  the 
following  set,  but  after  2-all  in  the  fourth  Little  and  Wright  forced  the 
pace  and  won  four  successive  games.  The  deciding  set  was  very  fast  all 
through,  but  in  nearly  every  instance  luck  favored  the  younger  team  and 
they  ran  into  a  lead  of  5/2.  Touchard  then  lost  his  serve,  but  Little, 
after  getting  to  40/15  on  his,  did  likewise  and  the  match  ended.  The 
following  round  resulted  in  a  default  to  Whitney  and  Bishop  and  an  easy 
win  for  Touchard  and  Gardner  in  the  upper  half.  In  the  lower  Holden  and 
Watrous  proved  too  strong  a  combination  for  Wale  and  Hallowell.  and 
the  easiest  win  of  the  round  was  scored  by  C.  G.  Plimpton  and  R.  H. 
Palmer  against  R.  Manning  and  A.  Ingram.  The  fifth  round  brought  forth 
another  surprise,  when  Whitney  and  Bishop  defeated  Touchard  and  Gardner. 
The  latter,  after  jumping  into  a  lead  of  5/1  in  the  first  set,  lost  ten 
straight  games.  In  the  second  they  succeeded  in  winning  two;  in  the 
third  it  was  only  won  by  them  after  twenty-four  games  had  been  played. 
At  this  point  the  court  was  changed,  but  instead  of  helping  Touchard  and 
Gardner  it  resulted  in  a  love  set  in  favor  of  their  younger  opponents.  In 
the  lower  half  Holden  and  Watrous  won  an  easy  straight  set  victory  from 
Palmer  and   Plimpton,   which   was  helped   along  by  Palmer's  wild  streak. 

The  final  was  played  on  the  championship  court  immediately  after  the 
final  singles,  and  attracted  very  little  attention.  It  was  fairly  even  tennis 
with  neither  team  playing  up  to  the  form  of  which  they  were  capable. 
Whitney  and  Bishop  won  the  first  two  sets  by  a  good  margin.  Holden 
and  Watrous  took  the  third,  6/2,  and  in  the  fourth  forced  the  score  to  s-all. 
At  that  point  Whitney,  by  very  fast  net  work  and  Bishop's  good  lobbing,. 
ran  out  the  match  with  the  loss  of  but  one  more  point.     The  summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  61 


Sectional   Championships 

Western  Championship. 

For  the  second  time  the  title  of  Western  Champion  was  won  by  a  man 
from  the  Pacific  Coast,  when  T.  C.  Bundy  came  through  the  tournament 
with  no  great  resistance  of  any  kind  and  annexed  the  title  through  the 
default  of  the  holder,  M.  PI.  Long.  IMay  was  begun  on  July  23  on  the 
courts  of  the  Onwentsia  Club  of  Lake  Forest,  111.  In  the  men's  singles  not 
one  of  his  opponents  seriously  threatened  Bundy's  flight  through  the  tourna- 
ment, with  the  single  exception  of  W.  T.  Hayes  of  Chicago.  In  that  match 
Hayes  won  the  first  set,  63,  and  succeeded  in  obtaining  a  lead  of  4/2  in 
the  second;  but  it  was  as  near  as  he  got  to  a  win.  Bundy  played  with 
much  greater  speed  from  that  point  on,  and  in  the  deciding  set  Hayes  won 
only  two  of  the  eight  games  played.  In  the  semi-final  round,  L.  H.  Waidner 
made  practically  no  impression  on  the  little  Calilornian,  getting  in  three 
sets  but  five  games,  while  in  the  final  round  A.  Ludke  went  through  the 
formality  of  playing  out  his  match  only  to  go  down  to  defeat  by  a  score 
of  6/2,  6/1,  6/0.  In  justice  to  the  latter,  however,  it  may  be  said  that  he 
did  not  approach  the  form  he  exhibited  in  his  earlier  matches,  when  he 
won  in  succession  from  C.  S.  Peters,  Trow  Hendrick,  Bundy's  partner, 
and  H.  H.  Whitman.  The  latter  forced  him  to  the  limit  in  the  semi-final 
round,   but    faded    comjiletely    in    tlie    fifth    set. 

The  two  strongest  teams  in  doubles  were,  fortunately,  on  opposite  halves 
of  the  draw,  and  a  very  close  match  was  played  in  the  final  round.  In 
this  Waidner  and  Paul  Gardner  were  opposed  to  J.  C.  Neely  and  H.  H. 
Whitney,  and  the  former  won  at  6/2.  4/6,  9/7,  6/3.  Throughout  the 
match  Waidner  and  Cardner  were  the  aggressors,  and  though  at  times 
erratic,  held  a  safe  lead  all  through.  Neely  and  Whitman  drove  well,  but 
their  net  play  was  decidedly  ineffective,  and,  as  a  result,  they  were  forced 
to  remain  in  the  back  court  almost  constantly.  The  high  lobs  which  they 
sent  up  only  delayed  an  inevitable  defeat,  for  Waidner  and  Gardner  both 
smashed  well.  The  third  set  was  the  best  of  the  match.  The  games  alter- 
nated up  to  7-all,  at  which  point  Gardner  and  Waidner,  by  coming  in  and 
volleying  splendidly  ofif  their  opponents'  drives,   ran  out   the  necessary  two. 

L^nusual  interest  was  manifested  in  the  women's  event,  in  which  Miss 
Gwendolyn  Rees  and  Miss  Marguerite  Davis  came  through  their  respective 
halves.  Miss  Rees  proved  much  the  stronger  of  the  two  in  the  final  round, 
and  won  easily  in  straight  sets.  The  challenge  match  between  Miss  Rees 
and  the  holder,  Miss  Carrie  B.  Neely,  produced  a  splendid  contest.  It  was 
a  battle  of  services  to  5-all  in  the  first  set,  when  Miss  Neely,  by  clever 
driving  to  her  opponent's  backhand,  broke  through  the  latter's  service  and 
followed  it  by  winning  her  own.  In  the  second  set  the  challenger's  chop 
improved  both  in  speed  and  direction,  and  Miss  Neely  was  defeated,  6/3, 
6/2.  The  latter  got  a  good  start  in  the  deciding  set  and  led  at  3/1  before 
Miss  Rees  began  to  overhaul  her.  At  5-all  the  challenger  won  a  love  game 
and  annexed  the  championship  with  the  next,  but  not  till  ten  points  had 
been  found  necessary  to  decide  it.     The  summaries:

Northwestern  Championship. 

The  week  commencing  July  18  was  that  in  which  the  Nineteenth  Annual 
Championship  of  the  Northwest  was  played  on  the  Minnetonka  Yacht 
Club's  courts  at  Deephaven,  Minn.  Conditions  under  which  this  tourna- 
ment was  played  were  ideal,  for  nowhere  are  there  finer  courts  or  circum- 
stances better  fitted  to  accommodate  the  enormous  crowd  which  turns  out 
annually  to  watch  the  tournament  than  there.  Throughout  the  week  there 
was  an  average  number  of  spectators  in  attendance  of  from  2,000  to  3,000, 
and  luckily  the  play  was  of  a  class  which  warranted  the  appreciation  of 
those  who  saw  it.  In  the  third  round  Waidner  of  Chicago  created  a  sur- 
prise by  the  easy  manner  in  which  he  defeated  Ray  Bronson.  He  took  the 
first  nine  games  of  the  match,  lost  the  next  three,  and  then  ran  out  his 
second  set  with  three  successive  games.  The  W.  C.  Burton-Armstrong 
match  was  another  interesting  one  of  the  round,  although  the  Minnesota 
State  champion  proved  rather  too  good  for  Burton  at  critical  times,  win- 
ning in  straight  sets,  both  at  7/5.  -  In  the  semi-final  W.  G.  Graves  was 
badly  outclassed  by  Waidner.  The  former  depends  largely  on  his  driving, 
while   the   latter  places  his  confidence  in   his   powers  at  the  net.     Waidner 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL,  65 

had  one  of  his  good  days  at  his  favorite  game  and  Graves'  best  drives  were 
treated  with  little  respect.  Waidner  got  everything,  and  combined  steadi- 
ness with  a  sharpness  of  volleying  that  was  remarkable.  The  score  was 
6/0,  7/5,  6/0.  In  the  other  half  one  of  the  closest  matches  of  the  tourna- 
ment resulted  when  Armstrong  and  Paul  Gardner  met.  The  latter  struck 
his  stride  at  the  very  commencement  of  play  and  quickly  ran  out  the  first 
set,  6/1.  In  the  second  Armstrong,  who  had  steadily  improved  in  the 
handling  of  Gardner's  service,  held  his  rival  down  to  9-all,  when  the  latter 
made  several  costly  errors  which  evened  the  set  score.  The  third  was 
(Gardner's  at  6/3,  but  his  advantage  was  short-lived,  for  the  fourth  went 
to  his  opponent  at  6/2.  In  the  fifth  set  Gardner  again  came  to  the  front, 
and,  by  forcing  his  younger  rival  to  the  net,  led  safely  throughout  the 
set,   winning  at   6/3. 

The  final  between  Waidner  and  Gardner  was  defaulted  by  the  latter 
after  Waidner  led  at  two  sets  to  one.  The  veteran  had  much  the  better 
of  the  argument  while  it  lasted,  winning  invariably  when  he  chose  to  come 
in  to  the  net.  In  the  second  set  he  remained  back  and  gave  Gardner  an 
opportunity  to  square  the  match,  but  the  third  set  found  the  veteran 
again  cutting  them  off  at  sharp  angles  and  chasing  his  doubles  partner  all 
over  his  court. 

No  team  was  in  a  class  with  Waidner  and  Gardner  in  the  doubles  event. 
In  their  first  round  they  outclassed  Thurston  and  Sutherland  and  in  the 
second  Gill  and  Douglass  were  able  to  win  but  three  games  in  their  match 
against  them.  The  nearest  approach  to  a  contest  with  these  two  was  the 
match  in  which  they  faced  Bronson  anil  Smith  in  the  semi-final.  ;The 
latter,  though  never  witliin  striking  distance  of  a  set,  kept  the  Chicagoans 
on  the  jump  and  forced  them  to  play  their  best  throughout  the  match. 
Adams  and  Armstrong  did  likewise  in  the  final,  but  their  inexperience  and. 
indifTerent  team  work  proved  too  great  a  handicap  for  them  to  overcome, 
Waidner  and  Gardner  won  the  match  at  6/4,  6/1,  6/2.     The  summaries:

New  Elngland  Championship. 

For  the  fourth  successive  year  Theodore  Roosevelt  Pell  earned  the  title 
of  New  England  champion.  This  time  he  defended  it  against  a  promising 
Yale  player,  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.,  who  had  come  through  the  tournament  in 
impressive  style,  winning  all  his  matches  easily,  and  at  no  time  being  in 
danger  of  dropping  a  set.  There  were  fewer  out-of-town  players  this  year 
than  last,  and  on  form  Ilolden  should  have  done  what  he  accomplished. 
His  hardest  match  was  that  played  against  F.  W.  Cole  of  Hartford,  whom 
he  beat  in  straight  sets,  6/3,  6/4.  On  the  other  side  of  the  draw  F.  M. 
Watrous,  Holden's  doubles  partner,  had  repeated  narrow  escapes  in  coming 
through  his  section.  Watrous  faced  Gib  Plimpton  in  his  first  match  and 
won  the  third  set,  6/4.  In  the  third  round  he  was  within  one  point  of 
losing  to  T.  Terry  and  in  the  semi-tinal  R.  H.  Cole  won  the  first  set,  6/2, 
and  led  at  5/2  in  the  second.  Watrous  won  the  set,  7/5,  and  the  third  by 
a  similar  score.  Against  Holden,  Watrous  could  accomplish  very  little. 
Probably  it  was  due  to  the  fact  that  the  former  knew  the  latter's  game  so 
well  that  the  score  was  so  one-sided,  for  Holden  won  at  6/3,  6/1,  6/1. 
In  the  challenge  round  Pell  proved  to  be  in  splendid  form.  He  combined 
accuracy  with  great  speed,  and  in  this  latter  respect  was  far  too  good  for 
his  younger  rival.  Holden  played  a  steady,  clever  game,  but  his  shots 
lacked  the  sting  of  Pell's  and  he  rarely  beat  the  former  on  speed  alone. 
Another  great  stumbling  block  for  the  Yale  captain  was  Pell's  backhand, 
for  try  as  he  would  he  could  not  keep  away  from  that  dangerous  stroke. 
Had  Holden's  drives  been  faster  Pell  would  have  been  unable  to  get 
around  them  as  he  did,  but  in  nine  cases  out  of  ten  a  shot  which  would 
ordinarily  have  gone  to  the  champion's  forehand,  somehow  or  other  would 
reach   the   other  side  of  his  racket. 

Holden  and  Watrous  had  things  pretty  much  their  own  way  in  the 
■doubles,  as  for  the  first  time  in  years,  no  other  high-class  teams  competed. 
Pell  doubled  up  with  F.  C.  Baggs  of  New  York,  and  in  their  second 
match  faced  the  winners  of  the  tournament.  Baggs,  however,  had  an 
off  day,  and  Pell,  in  his  anxiety  to  relieve  his  partner  of  unnecessary 
work,  went  off  decidedly  before  the  match  ended.  Holden  and  Watrous 
won  the  match,  6/4,  6/3. 

In  the  final  the  Yale  champions  faced  Bacon  and  Holton  and,  taking 
things  easily,  had  little  diflficulty  in  winning  in  straight  sets.  The  sum- 
maries:

North  Pacific  Annual  Meeting. 

The  Spokane  Coimtry  Club  was  the  scene  of  the  North  Pacific  Inter- 
national Lawn  Teiinis  Association's  tournament,  which  began  on  July  4. 
As  usual.  Schwengers  of  \'ictoria  proved  his  superiority  to  the  rest  of  the 
field,  but  it  was  not  without  a  narrow  escape  from  Fitz  of  Seattle.  The 
latter  won  the  first  set,  7/5,  and  continued  to  hold  his  own  in  the  second 
imtil  the  games  were  even  at  lo-all.  He  was  unable  to  continue  the  pace, 
and  Schwengers  won  the  set  and  the  third  rather  easily  at  6/2.  In  the 
final  match  Wickersham,  who  had  previously  defeated  Russell  and  Tyler, 
two  of  the  strongest  competitors  in  the  tournament,  was  outplayed  by 
Schwengers,  failing  to  win  a  set,  and  in  every  way  falling  short  of  the 
anticipation   of   his   followers. 

In  the  doubles  Wickersham  was  more  fortunate,  for,  paired  with  Gor- 
rill,  he  won  the  tournament,  defeating  in  the  final  Russell  and  Fitz,  6/4, 
6/1 J  7/5.     The  summaries:

Southern  Championship. 

When  play  began  for  the  Southern  Championship  on  the  Atlantic  Ath' 
letic  Club  courts  on  July  4  there  were  fifty-four  entries,  all  eager  to 
annex  the  title.  For  the  second  time  the  Doyles,  C.  B.  and  H.  L.,  jour- 
neyed from  Washington  to  compete  in  this  tournament,  and  this  time 
Conny  accomplished  his  desire.  Several  other  men  of  prominence  made 
the  trip,  among  them  being  W.  B.  Cragin,  Jr.,  and  W.  M.  Hall  of  New 
York,  and  James  H.  Winston  of  Norfolk,  Va.  After  playing  in  the 
earlier  rounds  Hall,  who,  with  the  exception  of  Doyle,  was  the  strongest 
visiting  player,  defaulted  to  Hugh  Whitehead,  but  Cragin  was  defeated 
by  11.  E.  Doyle.  Nat  Thornton,  the  ex-Southern  champion,  was  among 
those  to  go  down  before  Hall's  superior  skill,  and  the  latter's  default 
threw  quite  a  damper  on  the  enthusiasm  which  prevailed  throughout  the 
tournament. 

The  final  was  played  between  C.  B.  Doyle  and  James  H.  Winston,  and 
although  the  former  won  in  straight  sets,  the  match  produced  some  really 
excellentitennis.  In  the  first  set  Doyle  played  like  a- fiend,  being  invincible 
on  his  service  and  overhead.  In  the  second  \\\>  pace  slackened  consid- 
erably, and  Winston  forced  the  score  to  8-all  before  the  Washingtonian 
ran  out  two  successive  games.  The  third  set  was  the  fastest  of  the  three, 
for  Doyle  set  a  pace  which  Winston  was  unable  to  maintain  after  four  or 
five  games.     The  score  of  that  set  was  6/4.

THE    DOUBLES. 

Twenty  teams  comprised  the  entry  list  which  competed  for  the  right  tO' 
represent  the  South  in  the  preliminary  National  doubles  in  Chicago.  By 
far  the  best  of  these  were  the  l^oyle  brothers  and  Cragin  and  Hall.  Unfor- 
tunately, these  two  teams  were  drawn  on  the  same  side,  and  met  in  the 
semi-final  round.  A  very  close,  intercstng  match  was  played  between 
them,  but  the  long  experience  of  the  brothers  proved  too  much  for  the 
New  York  pair,  and  the  match  was  won  by  the  former,  6/4,  14/12,  6/2. 
In  the  other  semi-final  B.  M.  Grant  and  N.  Thornton,  ex-Southern  cham- 
pions, were  at  the  height  of  their  games  when  they  faced  Whitehead  and 
Winston,  winning  at  6/3,   6/2,   5/7,  6/3. 

The  final  brought  together  two  pairs  who  have  played  long  together 
and  against  each  other  on  more  than  one  occasion.  For  three  sets  it  was 
a  toss  up,  but  after  losing  the  third  Grant  and  Thornton  were  swept  off 
their  feet  in  the  fourth.  The  first  set  went  to  the  Doyles  at  6/4.  They 
were  so  much  faster  tlian  their  rivals  that  the  latter,  after  several  unsuc- 
cessful attempts  to  assume  the  net,  were  forced  to  remain  in  the  back  of 
the  court.  Both  the  Washingtonians,  however,  were  particularly  strong  in 
their  volleying  and  smashing,  and,  although  the  games  were  close,  there 
was  but  little  doubt  as  to  the  outcome.  In  the  second  set  Thornton  sud- 
denly loomed  in  front.  His  driving  was  accurate  and  his  smashing,  though 
not  severe,  was  splendidly  consistent.  Grant  played  a  steady  game  and 
could  be  relied  upon  at  all  times,  with  the  result  that  during  that  time  of 
the   match   they   outjilayed   their   opponents. 

The  third,  as  both  teams  recognized,  was  the  turning  point  in  the 
play.  Neither  had  much  advantage  over  the  other  until  the  games  reached 
8-all.  Then  Conny  Doyle,  by  splendid  volleying  and  faultless  serving,  did 
more  than  his  share  of  the  work  in  winning  two  straight  games.  The 
fourth  was  short  and  one-sided.  The  Doyles  increased  their  speed,  and 
forcing  their  advantage  against  the  apparently  discouraged  ex-champions,, 
took  the  set  with   the  loss  of  but  one  game. 

The  closest  kind  of  a  match  resulted  in  the  final  of  the  mixed  doubles,, 
when  Thornton  and  Mrs.  Willard  Sullivan  won  in  three  sets  from  Miss; 
Hildegarde  Turle  and  W.   B.   Cragin,   Jr. 

Miss  Turle,  however,  had  her  revenge  when  she  and  Mrs.  Sullivan 
came  together  in  the  challenge  round  of  the  ladies'  singles.  In  the  third 
set  of  this  match  Mrs.  Sullivan  was  within  one  point  of  winning,  but  a 
clever  pass  by  Miss  Turle  evened  the  score  and  the  latter  ran  out  the. 
necessary  games  to  win  at   7/5.     The  summaries:

Middle  States  Championship. 

As  in  past  years  the  Middle  States  championship,  played  in  Orange 
during  the  last" week  in  June,  attracted  quite  a  large  number  of  first-class 
men,  but  owing  to  intense  heat  and  the  early  date  the  form  exhibited  was 
not  of  the  best. 

The  men  to  win  their  way  through  their  respective  haloes  in  singles  were 
W.  F.  Johnson  and  N.  W.  Niles,  and  a  very  even  fight  resulted  when  they 
met.  Neither  one  was  very  steady,  however,  first  one  showing  in  front, 
then  the  other.  Niles  won  the  opening  set,  7/5,  Johnson  took  the  second, 
9/7,  and  the  third  went  to  Niles  rather  easily  at  6/3.  The  fourth  was 
close,  but  Niles  again  proved  the  stronger  after  the  score  reached  s-all. 
On  the  whole  the  evenness  was  the  only  redeeming  feature  of  the  contest, 
for  Niles  was  wild  and  Jolinson  lacked  sting  to  all  of  his  strokes,  netting 
constantly  but  rarely  chopping  out. 

There  were  several  decided  upsets  and  one  or  two  narrowly  averted 
ones  during  the  early  rounds  of  play.  Dean  Mathey  played  very  well, 
defeating  L.  E.  Mahan  before  losing  to  Niles.  L.  H.  Waidner  came  within 
a  point  of  disposing  of  C.  R.  Gardner,  and  the  surprise  of  the  tournament 
came  with  F.  C.  Inman's  defeat  by  G.  M.  Church.  The  latter  played  very 
cleverly  and  Inman  was  too  unsteady  to  check  his  fall.  Niles  won  from 
Church  in  the  next  round,  while  Johnson,  in  coming  through,  defeated 
both   Gardner  and   Palmer. 

H.  H.  Hackett  and  F.  B.  Alexander  met  with  no  serious  opposition  with 
the  exception  of  their  match  with  C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.,  and  H.  C.  Martin.  The 
Crescent  pair  ran  out  the  first  set,  6/2,  and  remained  on  even  terms  with 
the  champions  until  the  score  stood  at  4-all  in  the  second.  The  title- 
holders  took  the  following  two  games  and  the  third  set  in  short  order 
at  6/1. 

In  the  final  they  faced  P.  Gardner  and  L.  II.  Waidner,  who,  on  their  way 
through  the  tournament,  won  from  Niles  and  Dabney  in  three  hard-fought 
sets.  Against  Hackett  and  Alexander  the  Westerners  could  do  little,  and 
the  title   was  won  in   straight   sets  at   (t/z,  6/2,   6/1. 


Gulf  States  Championship. 

The  tenth  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  Gulf  States 
was  held  on  June  6  and  following  days  on  the  courts  of  the  New  Orleans 
Lawn  Tennis  Club.  Paul  D.  MacQuiston  won  the  tournament,  only  losing 
one  set  (and  that  in  the  final  round),  and  earning  the  right  to  challenge 
Esmond   Phelps,    the  title   holder. 

Logan  defeated  Cooper  in  the  final  round,  at  the  rather  peculiar  score 
of  6/0,   0/6,  6/4,  while   MacQuiston  easily  won  from  Norton,   6/1,   6/0.

pSc  Coast,  which  was  played  at  Del  Monte  September  5-  Although  the 
above  mentioned  players'  absence  was  greatly  regretted,  the  draw  with 
that    exception    was    an    excellent    one.    with    several    clever    newcomers    m

well  in  the  opposite  half.  The  only  man  to  win  a  set  from  him  was  W 
Bacon.  In  the  t^nal,  Young  made  an  excellent  stand  against  his  renowned 
rit-al  Long  won  the  opening  set.  but  carelessness,  combined  wi  ha 
decided  brace  by  his  rival,  cost  him  the  second.  He  went  for  he  third

The  feature  of  the  tournament  came  with  the  meeting  of  Miss  Sutton 
and  Miss  Ilotchkiss  in  the  final  of  the  ladies'  singles.  A  bad  start  gave 
Miss  Sutton  an  advantage  of  three  games,  but  Miss  Ilotchkiss  braced 
splendidly  and  reduced  the  score  at  five-all.  The  effort  was  too  much.

Pacific  Coast  Doubles. 

Played  at  Long  Beach,  beginning  July  i,  the  tournament  for  the  Doubles 
Championship  of  the  Pacific  Coast  furnished  one  of  the  biggest  surprises 
0&.  the  season  when  M.  E.  McLoughlin  and  M.  H.  Long,  playing  together 
for  the  first  time,  were  defeated  in  the  final  round  by  T.  C.  Bundy  and 
T.  Hendrick.  The  young  internationalists  expected  to  prove  the  national 
title  holders'  worthy  opponents.  The  match  was  a  great  one  and  was 
won  and  lost  time  and  again  by  both  teams  before  Long  fell  down  in  the 
last  game  of  the  fifth  heart-breaking  set.  In  brief,  the  match  progressed 
as  follows:  Bundy  and  Hendrick  won  the  first  set,  taking  alternate  games 
until  the  fifth,  when  they  broke  through  McLoughlin's  service.  They  lost 
that  advantage  on  the  eighth  game,  however,  when  Hendrick  dropped  his 
serve,  evening  the  score  to  four-all.  It  was  Long  who  lost  his  serve  in 
the  eleventh,  and  the  set  ended,  7/5.  The  second,  another  deuce  set, 
went  to  the  Northerners  at  8/6.  due  to  their  breaking  into  Bundy's  service, 
in  the  fourteenth  game.  In  the  third  set,  McLoughlin  played  brilliantly, 
killing  many  lobs,  and  using  his  forehand  drive  most  advantageously,  but 
Long  deteriorated,  and  the  Los  Angeles  pair  won  at  6/2.  The  fourth  set 
reversed  the  performance,  going  to  Long  and  McLoughlin  at  6/3.  The 
fifth  set  found  Bundy  the  only  one  of  the  quartette  able  to  increase  his. 
speed  or  better  his  game.  Hendrick  was  badly  fatigued,  while  McLough- 
lin had  slowed  down  and  Long  was  deplorably  "off."  At  5/3,  with 
Bundy's  service  to  follow,  it  looked  to  be  all  over,  but  McLoughlin 
braced  finely,  making   four  brillant  shots  and   winning  his  service  to  make

it  five-all  It  was  a  dying  effort,  however,  for  Hendrick's  delivery  gave 
his  side  the  advantage,  and  Long  went  to  pieces  in  the  following  game, 
serving  a  double  and  otherwise  showmg  distress  signals  The  victory  of 
the  Southerners  was  a  great  surprise,  but  they  earned  their  right  to  com-

Middle  Atlantic  Championship. 

With  two  large  and  successful  tournaments  and  numerous  inter-city 
matches  played  on  the  courts  of  the  B.achelors'  Lawn  Tennis  Club,  the 
season   of    1910   in   Washington    was  a   very   successful   one. 


the 


The  Mid.Ue  Atlantic  Tournament  beginning  May  23  added  another  to 
li.e  long  li«t  of  Middle  Atlantic  honors  won  by  Harold  L.  Doyle,  whose 
victory  in  this  tournament  placed  his  name  for  the  third  successive  time 
upon  the  handsome  trophy  presented  by  the  Bachelors  Lawn  iennis 
Club,    which    trophy   became   his   absolute    property.  _ 

The  finals  in  the  ladies'  singles  between  Miss  Mane  Wimer  of  Wash- 
ington and  Miss  Hildegarde  Turle  of  Brooklyn  resulted  in  a  match 
renlete  with  skillful  tennis  and  which  is  regarded  as  the  finest  exhibition 
of  tennis  ever  played  by  ladies  in  Washington.  The  contestants  were 
fmely  matched  and  the  play  was  thoroughly  enjoyed  by  a  large  gathering 
of  tennis  enthusiasts.  The  long  struggle  was  finally  brought  to  an  end 
by  the   victory   of   Miss  Wimer   by   the   score   of  6/4,   6/4.

State    Championships 


California  State  Championship. 

Melville  Long  won  the  tenth  championship  of  California,  held  on  the 
courts  of  the  University  of  California,  in  Berkeley,  August  24  and  fol- 
lowing days.  In  the  semi-tinal  round  Long  won  an  easy  victory  over  B. 
Batkin,  and  E.  Fottrell  defeated  J.  Kohlfs,  in  a  fairly  good  match.  Long 
completely   outclassed   Fottrell    in   the    final    round. 

Keuben  Hunt  was  expected  to  come  through  to  the  final  round  and 
rnake  it  interesting  for  Long,  but  he  was  defeated  in  the  second  by  W. 
Ci.  Knowlton,  7/5,  1/6,  6/4,  not  having  been  up  to  his  usual  form.  Long 
had  an  easy  path  io  victory,  not  having  lost  a  set,  and  winning  at  least 
one  love   set  in  every   match  he    played. 

Long  and  W.  Dawson  won  the  doubles  championship,  defeating  Fottrell 
and  Batkin  in  the  final  round,  6,  i,  7,5,  6/j.  It  must  be  said,  in  fairness 
to  Fottrell  and  Batkin,  that  they  were  slightly  off  their  games,  although 
Long  and    Dawson   are   a    much    stronger   combination. 

Miss  Hazel  Hotchkiss  won  the  ladies'  singles  championship,  defeating 
Miss  Golda  Myer  in  the  final  round,  0/2,  0/4.  The  match  was  an  excel- 
lent one,  many  of  the  points  going  back  and  forth  innumerable  times 
before  they  were  finally  decided.  Both  Miss  Hotchkiss  and  Miss  Myer 
reached  the   final   round   without  losing  a  set.     The  summaries:

Colorado  State  Championship. 

On  the  Denver  Country  Club's  courts.  C.  P.  Dodge  of  Colorado  won 
the  State  Championship.  He  played  Donald  Harker  in  the  challenge  round 
on   September   3   and   won   in   straight   sets. 

The  tournament  was  successful  in  every  sense,  forty  entries  being  drawn 
in  singles  and  twenty  competing  for  the  doubles  title.  Champion  Harker's 
defeat  in  singles  proved  the  big  surprise,  but  his  play  was  far  below  his 
standard   of  a  season   ago. 

The  doul)les  iionors  were  won  by  the  title  holders,  Graham  and  Morey, 
from  Scribner  and  Hutchinson.  The  challengers  were  outplayed  from 
beginning  to  end  and  were  defeated  in  straight  sets.  The  final  doubles 
was  interesting  but  disappointing,  because  of  the  default  of  Dodge  and 
Scribner.  For  four  sets  the  men  played  on  even  terms,  but  at  love-three 
in  the  fifth  set  Scribner  and  Dodge  withdrew.  It  was  quite  dark  and 
Dodge,  who  had  previously  played  his  singles  match,  was  greatly  fatigued, 
so  that  in  all  probability  the  result,  had  they  continued,  would  have  been 
the  same. 


Connecticut  State  Championship. 

A  much  higher  class  entry  than  had  ever  before  competed  was  drawn 
for  the  sixth  annual  tournament  for  the  State  title  at  the  Litchfield  Club 
■on  July  12.  Dr.  Hawk,  the  holder;  F.  C.  Inman,  L,  D.  Woodbury,  F. 
M.  Watrous  and  R.  A.  Holden  all  took  part,  and  there  was  much  excel- 
lent play.  Inman  had  his  hands  full  when  he  faced  Dr.  Hawk  in  the 
semi-final.  The  latter  was  as  steady  as  usual  and  had  besides  a  streak  of 
fast  driving  which  forced  his  left-handed  opponent  to  extend  himself  to 
the  utmost.  The  first  set  was  very  close,  but  in  the  second  Inman 
increased  his  speed  and  held  the  upper  hand  at  all  stages.  His  service 
was  faultless  and  drives  fast  and  at  impossible  angles.  In  the  final,  Wood- 
bury, who  had  previously  upset  calculations  by  disposing  of  Fred  Harris 
in  two  fast  sets,  was  far  below  his  true  form,  Inman  completely  out- 
classed him.  winning  without  much  effort  at  5/2,  6/2,  6/2. 


84  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Hawk  and  Harris  had  things  their  own  way  in  the  doubles.  In  the

Delaware  State  Championship. 

On  July  9  the  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Delaware 
v.'as  be"gun  at  the  Wilmington  Country  Club.  The  best  players  entered 
came  from  Philadelphia,  and  these  included  H.  J.  Rendall,  H.  M.  and  W. 
M.  Tilden,  J.  R.  Carpenter,  Jr.,  and  A.  Thayer.  The  draw  was  an  unfor- 
tunate one,  however,  for  the  Tildens  drew  each  other  in  the  first  round- 
H.  M.  won  and  had  little  trouble  until  he  faced  Carpenter.  The  latLv;r 
played  splendidly  for  two  sets,  but  in  the  deciding  one  went  to  pieces- 
badlv.    winning   but    one   game. 

Rendall  and  Thayer  worked  their  way  through  the  lower  side  of  the 
draw  and  faced  each  other  in  the  semi-final.  Rendall  was  too  steady  and 
•'1st  for   his   opponent  and  won   rather  easily  in  two  sets. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  83 

The  final,  between  Tilden  and  Rendall,  was  close,  and  much  cleverness 
was  dirplayed  by  both  men.  The  first  set  was  a  question  of  service  alone 
for  ten  games.  Rendall  at  that  point  tried  three  fast  drives  and  each 
was  perfect.  He  took  the  game  and  set  on  service.  The  second  and  third 
sets  were  like  the  first,  Kendall  playing  an  aggressive  but  withal  remark- 
ably steady  game,  while  Tilden  was  erratic  and  inclined  to  slumps.  In 
the  challenge  round  Wallace  Johnson,  the  holder,  was  too  clever  for  his 
rival  and  won  easily  at  6/4,  6/2,  6/4.  His  chops  were  fast  and  well 
■directed.  Kendall's  net  work  was  of  little  use  and  from  the  back  court 
he   was   outclassed. 

The  doubles  brought  out  a  big  upset  when  Dewhurst  and  Carpenter 
went  down  in  the  final  in  straight  sets  to  Kendall  and  Rogers.  The 
losers  played  brilliantly  at  times,  but  at  others  went  off  badly.  Rendall 
was,  as  usual,  steady  as  a  clock,  and  Rogers  played  almost  as  well. 
Tilden  and  Thayer,  however,  were  too  fast  a  combination  for  their  chal- 
lengers, and  although  the  first  two  sets  were  close,  the  result  was  never 
in   doubt.      The   summaries:

Nat  Thornton,  as  expected,  won  the  tournament,  but  the  feat  was  not 
accomplished  without  difficulty.  In  the  semi-final  round  Appel,  who  for 
years  has  been  the  best  local  man,  gave  Thornton  the  fight  of  his  life. 
Losing  the  first  set,  6/4,  he  waded  in  and  so  far  outplayed  Thornton  that 
the  latter  won  but  two  games  in  the  next  two  sets.  The  effort  proved  his 
undoing,  for  with  the  beginning  of  the  fourth  set  he  faded  and  Thornton 
won  at  6/4,  2/6,   0/6,  6/3,  6/1. 

In  the  final  round  J.  McKay  was  unable  to  do  anything  against  Thorn- 
ton's over-night  improvement.  The  latter  was  fast  and  accurate  and  won 
handily,   6/1,   6/2,  6/1. 

The  challenge  round  found  champion  R.  A.  Holden  in  great  form  and 
from  the  outset  he  had  Thornton  on  the  defensive.  The  former  drove 
well,  but  his  net  game  was  faultless.  lie  blocked  perfectly  and  his  volleys 
were  at  irnpossible  angles.^  Thornton  was  practically  helpless  against  the 
intercollegiate  title  holder's  machine-like  game  and  won  but  seven  games 
in   the  match.      The  score   was   6/3,   6/1,   6/3. 

Thornton  played  with  Marty  in  the  doubles  and  they  so  far  outclassed 
the  field  that  no  team  succeeded  in  winning  a  set  from  them.  In  the  final 
they  made  short  work  of  their  opponents,  Trask  and  Appel,  winning  at 
6/1,  6/3,  6/3.     The  summaries:

Kansas  State  Championship. 

The  fourth  annual  tournament  of  the  Kansas  Open  .State  Lawn  Tennis 
Association  was  held  on  the  Wichita  Country  Club  courts,  four  in 
number,  July  18  to  23.  Large,  enthusiastic  galleries  were  in  attend- 
ance the  entire  week.  The  weather  was  ideal,  and  some  very  fine  tennis 
was  developed  before  the  first  round  was  completed.  Gordon  Parker,  the 
winner,  who  will  be  remembered  by  some  as  having  been  one  of  the  first 
ten  in   1894,  was  never  in   danger,   losing  only  two  sets  in  the  entire  week. 

Much  to  the  disappointment  of  the  gallery,  no  challenge  rounds  were 
played.  Robert  H.  Bradford.  Kansas  singles  champion,  and  Otto  Dubach, 
who,  with  Mr.  Bradford,  held  the  doubles  championship,  were  not  present, 
therefore  both  matches  were  defaulted,  the  singles  to  Gordon  Parker, 
Wichita,  Kan.,  and  the  doubles  to  W.  A.  Penley  and  H.  E.  Uncapher, 
Augusta,   Kan.      The   summaries:

Kentucky  Bi-State  Event. 


A  new  fixture  was  inaugurated  when,  on  September  6,  the  first  Bi-State 
was  played  on  the  Audubon  Country  Club's  courts,  of  Louisville,  Ky.  The 
name  Bi-State  was  decided  on  because  the  tournament  involved  the  titles 
of    Kentucky   and   Ohio. 

Clifford  Lockhorn  of  Cincinnati,  a  young  player  with  apparently  great 
possibilities,  won  the  singles.  He  all  but  lost  to  Frank  Marty  in  his 
second  match,  but  made  a  fine  recovery  when  Marty  led  at  4/1  in  the 
deciding  set.  In  the  final  he  faced  a  fellow  townsman,  John  Wentzel, 
who  had  previously  defeated  Dr.  P.  B.  Hawk,  and  beat  him  in  a  sen- 
sational   five-set   match,   in   which    Wentzel   led   at   one   time   by   two   sets. 

Ellwood  Pfau  and  Allen  Andrews  won  the  doubles  in  clever  style  from 
Day   and   McNair   of    Louisville.      The    summaries:

Maryland  Closed  Championship. 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  championships  of  Maryland,  open  only 
to  residents  of  the  State,  began  on  June  14  at  the  Catonsville  Country 
Club. 

It  so  happened  that  Clarence  Fisher,  a  young  and  fast  improving 
player,  who  won  the  title,  met  his  worthiest  opponent  in  the  first  round 
when  he  opposed  II.  B.  Davis.  Davis,  by  steady,  consistent  play,  won 
the  first  set  after  Fisher  had  led,  at  5/2.  The  next  two  were  both  close, 
but   Fisher   was  steady   and   far   more   aggressive. 

The  men  to  reach  the  semi-final  and  face  each  other  there  were  Fisher 
and  C.  G.  Brooke  in  one  half  and  J.  S.  Kerr  and  B.  Harvey.  Brooke 
was  no  match  for  Fisher,  but  largely  due  to  the  latter's  carelessness  he 
forced  the  second  set  to  8/6.  Against  Harvey,  Kerr  put  up  a  stiff  argu- 
ment for  two  sets,  but  after  winning  the  second  at  11/9,  he  faded  and 
made   but  little  attempt  to   stop   his  fresher   rival. 

In  the  final  Fisher  outplayed  Harvey,  in  every  way  for  two  sets.  In 
the  third  overconfidence  again  got  the  better  of  his  judgment,  but  when 
within   a   point   of   losing   he   braced   and   ultimately   won   the   set   at    10/8. 

Fisher  and  II.  B.  Davis,  and  Kerr,  playing  with  J.  R.  White,  met  in 
the  final  round  of  doubles.  For  two  sets  it  was  a  toss-up,  but  White 
collapsed  suddenly  early  in  the  third  and  it  was  some  time  before  he 
revived  sufficiently  to  continue.  He  was  far  from  his  true  game  when  play 
was  resumed,  and  Fisher  and  Davis  won  as  they  chose.     The  summaries:

Minnesota  State  Tennis  Tournament. 

The  Minnesota  State  tennis  tournament  of  1910  opened  at  the  Town 
and  Country  Club,  on  the  banks  of  the  Mississippi  River  at  St.  Paul, 
August  20,  and  continued  for  ten  days.  The  location  of  the  club  being 
between  St.  Paul  and  Minneapolis,  the  largest  crowds  in  the  long  history 
of  Minnesota  State  tournaments  attended.  The  surprise  of  the  tourna- 
ment was  the  remarkal)le  showing  made  by  John  Adams  of  St.  Paul. 
Though  he  had  not  engaged  in  tourney  play  for  over  a  year,  the  Univer- 
sity of  Minnesota  star  fought  his  way  up  through  the  early  rounds  until 
he  met  and  defeated  J.  H.  Wheeler  in  the  finals,  2/6,  6/2,  6/2,  6/2,  an<l 
won  the  right  to  meet  the  challenger,  Joe  Armstrong,  also  of  St.  Paul, 
who  won  tlie  tourney  and  challenge  round  in  1909.  Wheeler,  who  the 
week  before  had  won  the  St.  Paul  city  title,  downing  a  large  field,  fully 
came  up  to  expectations,  but  Adams,  by  greater  skill  at  the  net,  overcame 
his  older  opponent,  who  is  often  called  the  "Father  of  Tennis  in  Minne- 
sota." Wheeler,  essentially  a  base-line  player,  had  wonderful  control,  but 
Adams'   volleying  and   cross   shots   were   the   delight    of  the   spectators. 

August  29  was  the  date  set  for  the  challenge  round  and  Adams  annexed 
the  title,  defeating  Armstrong,  2/6,  6/3,  6/3,  7/9,  6/3,  the  result  being 
in  doubt  till  the  last  point  was  made.  The  fourth  set  went  to  Armstrong, 
after  great  play,  and  the  set  score  was  2  up.  It  took  106  points  to 
decide  the  fourth  set,  of  which  Adams  took  55.  Four  of  the  sixteen 
games    went    to    deuce    for   long   variations.      Adams    made    the   game    score 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TKNNIS    ANNUAL.  95 

4/1  in  his  favor,  but  lost  control,  and  Armstrong  took  four  straight  before 
he  was  checked.  With  the  set  score  2-all,  Adams  was  irresistible.  His 
tremendous  speed  puzzled  his  opponent,  who  drove  the  ball  out  of  the 
court  many  times,  and  Adams  annexed  the  Gopher  title,  for  which  sixty- 
experts   competed   in   the    singles,   with   a   6/3   game. 

The  women's  events  were  scarcely  less  interesting  and  were  featured 
by  the  work  of  Miss  Gwendolyn  Rees.  She  won  the  tournament  play, 
6/2.  6/1.  and  followed  it  up  by  defeating  the  challenger.  Miss  Margurite 
Davis,  6/2,  6/2. 

It  was  soon  apparent  that  with  her  terrific  side  stroke.  Miss  Davis  was 
no    match    for   an    opponent   who    entered    in    many    of    the    women's    cham- 

i)ionships  of  the  Mid-West  and  s*ood  high  wherever  she  played.  Miss 
^ees,  a  young  woman,  is  expected  this  year  to  gain  great  laurels  in  the 
larger  tennis  championships.  She  is  without  a  peer  in  Minnesota  and  the 
Northwest. 

In  the  men's  doubles,  J.  H.  Wheeler  of  St.  Paul  and  TraflFord  Payne 
of  Minneapolis  lost  to  the  stellar  pair,  Adams  and  Armstrong  of  St.  Paul, 
^/3.  6/4,  4/6,  6/1.  In  the  women's  doubles  Miss  Rees  and  Miss  Harrow 
of  St.  Paul  won  from  Miss  Davis  of  St.  Paul  and  Miss  Murray  of  Minne- 
apolis. The  mixed  doubles  found  stars  playing  the  finals.  Miss  Margurite 
Davis  and  Toe  Armstrong  of  St.  Paul,  the  ex-champions,  met  Miss  Rees 
and  John  Adams,  present  champions,  and  lost  to  the  "champs,"  who  were 
deadly  accurate  and  easily  took  the  play  with  splendid  short  drives  and 
good   lobs,   6/2,   6/3. 

Duhith  players,  who  entered  fourteen  strong,  were  eliminated  after  the 
first  seven  days,  but  they  went  home  with  the  honor  of  holding  the  191 1 
tourney  in  the  Zenith  City.  T  II.  W'heeler  of  St.  Paul  was  elected 
president   of   the    Minnesota   Tennis   Association. 


New  York  State  Championship. 

No  tournament  of  the  season  attracted  a  wider  interest  or  produced  such 
■unexpected  results  as  the  Annual  State  Championship  held  at  the  Crescent 
Club's  courts  in  New  York,  beginning  June  2^.  In  the  first  round  of  play 
the  unexpected  developed  when  W.  L.  Pate  disposed  of  G.  M.  Church,  and 
W.  M.  Hall  all  but  beat  the  wonderful  Coast  player,  McLoughlin.  In  the 
second  round  W.  F.  Johnson  put  T.  R.  Pell  out  of  the  running  in  a  three- 
set  match,  and  astonishment  was  unbounded  when  C.  M.  Bull.  Jr.,  had 
the  better  of  his  argument  with  McLoughlin.  In  the  latter  match  the  first 
set  was  fairly  close  until  5-all,  when  McLoughlin  won  two  successive  games. 
The  second  and  third  were  both  scored  by  Bull  with  surprising  ease  at 
6/2,  6/3.  Throughout  the  three  sets  McLoughlin  failed  to  improve  over 
the  form  he  showed  the  previous  day  against  Hall,  and  his  own  weak  game 
was  largely  responsible  for  his  defeat  at  the  Crescent  Club  man's  hands. 
Bull  played  very  steadily,  but  seldom  with  such  severity  that  McLoughlin 
did  not  have  the  necessary  opportunities  to  score.  The  latter,  however, 
was  totally  unable  to  take  advantage  of  the  chances  afforded  him.  In  the 
same  round  L.  E.  Mahan  won  in  straight  sets  from  W.  B.  Cragin,  Jr.,  and 
F.  C.  Inman  had  little  difficulty  in  defeating  S.  H.  Voshell.  Bull  continued 
his  victorious  path  the  following  day  when  he  faced  R.  H.  Palmer.  The 
two  sets  played  were  very  close,  but  in  both  Bull's  steadiness  gave  him  at 
critical  times  the  necessary  points.  Inman  upset  calculations  by  winning 
from  Johnson.  The  remaining  two  to  reach  the  semi-finals  were  Gardner 
and   Mahan. 

The  following  day  Gardner  disposed  of  Mahan  in  three  straight  sets  with 
comparatively  little  trouble,  and  Inman  proved  altogether  too  clever  and 
bard-hitting  a  player  for  Bull.  The  latter  was  defeated  d/z,  6/4,  ()/2.  The 
final    between    Inman   and   Gardner   might  also   come    under   the    head   of   a 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  97 

form  reversal,  for  with  the  exception  of  the  second  set,  Inman  had  the 
match  in  hand.  The  latter's  service  was  remarkably  effective.  (Gardner 
could  do  little  with  it,  while  on  the  o'her  hand,  his  own  delivery  proved 
much  less  a  barrier  to  Inman.  The  latter  drove  surely  and  at  very  sharp 
angles,  rarely  placing  the  balls  to  deep  court,  and  on  all  his  returns  he 
succeeded  in  gaining  position  at  the  net.  Once  there,  he  volleyed  so  accu- 
rately and  sharply  that  Gardner  was  kept  constantly  on  the  defensive,  and 
in  view  of  the  game  played  by  the  men  the  result,  in  favor  of  Inman,  at 
6/3,  3/6,   6/4,   6/3,   was   not   so   surprising.      The   summaries:

The  nearest  to  defeat  in  more  than  one  sense  that  Hackett  and  Alexander 
ever  came  since  they  won  the  championship  four  years  ago  took  place  when, 
in    the    semi-final    round    of    doubles,    they    met    McLoughlin    and    Gardner. 


SrALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  99 

It  was  a  wonderful  five-set  match  with  little  to  choose  between  the  two 
teams.  None  of  the  first  four  sets,  however,  produced  tennis  to  even 
approach  that  played  in  the  fifth.  The  California  combination  played  fault- 
lessly then,  and  succeeded  in  running  the  score  up  to  4/1,  with  Hackett  to 
serve  on  the  sixth  game.  At  that  stage  it  looked  to  be  all  over  for  the 
title-holders,  for  the  San  Franciscans  came  within  a  point  of  making  the 
score  s/i.  The  difference  between  the  men  at  this  stage  was  very  apparent, 
for  Ilackctt  and  .Mexander  both  sliovved  signs  of  fatigue  much  greater  than 
that  of  their  younger  opponents.  At  4/2,  McLoughlin  serving,  Ilackett  and 
Alexander  started  what  was  probably  the  greatest  rally  of  their  tennis 
careers,  for  by  furious  driving  and  taking  desperate  chances  they  banged 
out  game  after  game  in  an  unending  string,  until  they  had  landed  the 
set  in  their  favor  at  6/4.  Ilackett  served  the  last  game  of  the  match  and 
got  to  40/30,  when  an  opportunit}'  was  given  McLoughlin  to  tie  the  score; 
however,  in  his  effort  to  smash  for  an  ace  the  Californian  sent  the  ball 
wide  of  the  side  lines.  Never  in  the  history  of  tlie  game  around  New  York 
did  a  contest  evoke  the  enthusiasm  that  this  one  did,  and  the  sympathy 
of  the  enormous  crowd  was  all  with  the  youngsters,  who  so  narrowly  missed 
accomplishing  wliat  no  team  has  since  Alexander  and  Ilackett  won  the 
American   Chami)ionship. 

In  the  final  round  Bull  and  Martin  could  make  but  little  progress  against 
their  opponents  and  were  defeated  in  straight  sets  at  6/3,  8/6,  6/2.  The

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  101 

Oregon  State  Championship. 

Nat  Emerson,  formerly  of  Cincinnati,  but  a  fruit  grower  of  North 
Yakima  now,  outclassed  a  field  of  seventy  players  who  competed  for  the 
championships  of  Oregon,  which  began  July  i8  under  the  auspices  of  the 
Multnomah    Athletic   Club   of   Portland. 

Until  he  reached  the  final  round,  where  he  was  opposed  by  Ralph  Gor- 
rill,  not  one  of  his  opponents  were  able  to  extend  the  ex-VVestern  cham- 
pion. Gorrill,  however,  played  remarkably  well  and  was  only  beaten  after 
three  sets,  in   which   every  point  was  closely   contested,  at   12 'lo,    6/4,   6/3. 

The  challenge  rotnid  was  one-sided,  Wickersham,  the  holder,  being  no 
match  for  the  more  experienced  Emerson.  The  latter  won  easily  at  6/1, 
6/1,  7/5. 

Wickersham,  pained  with  Gorrill.  had  his  revenge  in  the  doubles,  for  he 
won   a  close  five-set  match   from   Emerson   and   Andrews. 

Miss  Hazel  Ilotchkiss,  who  made  her  third  trip  to  this  tournament,  was 
supreme  in  the  ladies'  events,  outclassing  completely  her  challenger  in 
singles.  Miss  Pitts,  and  winning  easily  with  Miss  Leadbetter  in  doubles. 
She  also  annexed  the  mixed  events'   honors   with   Gorrill.      The   summaries:

Pennsylvania  State  Championship. 

With  a  record  entry  of  fifty-two  players,  the  annual  Pennsylvania 
State  Championships  began  on  June  6  at  the  Merion  Cricket  Club  of  Phil- 
adelphia. New  York,  Washington  and  Pittsburg  were  represented  by 
F.  C.  Inman,  Homer  Deis  and  P.  Siverd,  respectively,  and  the  outlook 
indicated    some   excellent   tennis. 

The  draw  was  not  a  well  divided  one,  however,  for  in  the  first  round 
F.  G.  Anderson  and  J.  C.  Carpenter.  Jr..  drew,  with  H.  J.  Rendall  wait- 
ing to  play  the  winner.  The  Anderson-Carpenter  match  was  a  good  one, 
with  the  former  showing  his  usual  accuracy  from  the  back  court.  Car- 
penter's early  sallies  to  the  net  were  disastrous  for  him  and  he  was 
forced  to  remain  back  after  the  uselessness  of  trying  to  handle  "Andy's" 
drives  was  impressed  upon  him.  It  was  close  at  that.  Anderson  winning 
at  6/4,  5/7,  6/4.  In  the  next  round  Anderson  and  Rendall  had  a  great 
battle,  which  was  all  but  lost  by  the  former  when  Rendall  led  at  5/2 
and  3/0.  Rendall  was  very  fast  and  accurate  at  the  net  and  Anderson 
found  it  impossible  at  times  to  pass  him.  When  within  two  points  of 
defeat  the  latter  tried  a  series  of  daring  shots,  which  fortunately  went 
true   and   he  ultimatelv   won   the   dec'dng   set   at    10/8. 

The  third  round  proved  H.  M.  Tilden's  undoing.  Considered  to  have 
had  a  better  chance  than  any  one.  wi^h  Inman's  exception,  he  went  down 
before  the  remarkable  steadiness  and  clever  headwork  of  Dr.  P.  B.  Hawk, 
in  straight  sets  at  7/5.  6/2.  Siverd  had  his  first  hard  match  in  that 
round    w^hen    he    faced '  W.    II.    Trotter.      The    latter,    after    winning    a    set 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  103 

and  leading  at  3/0  in  the  second,  slowed  down  and  gave  Siverd  a  chance 
which  lost  him  the  match.  The  fourth  round  produced  a  big  surprise 
when  Craig  Biddle  outplayed  Anderson.  Biddle's  service  was  excellent 
and,  combined  with  deep  drives  to  Anderson's  back  hand,  proved  too 
heavy  odds  for  the  ex-Canadian  champion.  Siverd  earned  his  place  in 
the  semi-final  by  winning  from  Dr.  Hawk.  The  latter  was  not  quite  up 
to  form  and  Siverd  won  at  6/4,  6/4.  Inman  and  W.  M.  Tilden  had  easy 
matches  and  the  quartette  was  completed  when  Bidd'e  put  Anderson  out 
of  the  runiiing.  The  day  the  semi-finals  were  to  have  been  played  found 
the  courts  in  wretched  shape  after  an  all-night  downpour,  but  Inman 
and  Siverd  decided  to  play  their  match  off  anyway.  The  result  was 
another  reversal  of  form,  for  Inman  slipped  and  slid  around  the  court 
absolutely  unable  to  keep  his  feet.  Siverd,  however,  was  apparently 
oblivious  of  the  court's  condition  and  played  a  fast,  sure  game.  He  won 
at  1 1/9  and  6/3.  The  soft  court  proved  a  great  handicap  to  Biddle  also, 
but  in  a  different  way  from  Inman,  for  it  offset  his  fast  service  and  the 
speed  of  his  drives.  Tilden  played  a  placing  game  entirely  and  won  at 
6/4,    8/6. 

The  final  was  played  on  Monday  on  a  court  still  heavy  from  rain.  For 
two  sets  Siverd  was  outplayed  and  beaten  at  every  angle.  Tilden  was 
faster,  hit  harder  and  used  better  generalship.  But  the  tide  changed  with 
the  beginning  of  the  third.  Siverd  forced  Tilden  out  of  court  with  sharp 
cross  court  drives,  which  he  followed  into  the  net.  He  rarely  misplayed 
his  shots  and  showed  an  ability  to  get  impossible  plays  second  only  to 
"Rab"  Seavers.  Tilden  tired  rapidly  after  his  early  efforts  and  Siverd 
finally   won  at  6/8,    .2/6,   6/2,   7/5,   6/2. 

The  challenge  round  was  played  the  following  day  and  lasted  less  than 
an  hour.  Wallace  Johnson,  the  defending  champion,  had  a  good  day 
with  his  famous  chop  and  Siverd  was  beaten  to  a  standstill.  Johnson's 
control  was  faultless  and  he  shot  the  ball  through  openings  which  were 
so  small  as  to  pass  unnoticed.  His  lobbing  was  excellent  also  and  by 
way  of  variety  he  would  draw  Siverd  in  with  a  gentle  drop  and  catch 
him  on  the  second  stroke  with  a  low  fast  lob.  The  score  was  6/2, 
6/2,   6/3. 

The  doubles  brought  the  two  best  teams  together  in  the  final.  Johnson 
and  Inman  and  Kendall  paired  with  Herbert  Tilden.  Neither  Inman  nor 
Kendall  were  quite  up  to  the  mark,  but  Johnson  and  Tilden  played 
splendid  tennis.  The  match  was  as  close  as  it  could  possibly  be,  but  at 
four-all  in  the  fifth  set  Tilden  cut  loose  with  a  burst  of  speed  which 
was  irresistible.     The  total   score  was   4/6,   6/4,   6/4,  4/6,  6/4. 

The  challenge  round  found  Tilden  suffering  from  a  reaction  of  his  play 
of  the  previous  day  and  Kendall  but  a  shade  better.  The  holders.  Dew- 
hurst  and  Carpenter,  played  well  together  and  were  never  in  danger  of 
defeat.     They  won  at  7/5,  6/2,  4/6,  6/3.     The  summaries:

Rhode  Island  State  Championship. 

For  the  tiiird  successive  year  J.  1).  E.  Tones  carried  oft  the  honors 
of  the  Rhode  Island  Championship  when  he  defeated  his  challenger,  R.  N. 
Dana,  in  straight  sets.  The  tournament  began  on  September  19  at  the 
Agawam    Hunt    Club. 

The  draw  was  well  divided  and  in  the  semi-final  round  the  matches 
produced  some  high  class  tennis.  Dana  opposed  E.  T.  Gross.  It  was 
the  fourth  meeting  of  the  pair  in  that  tournament  and  Dana's  string  of 
victories  was  increased  to  four  straight.  It  was  a  hard-fought  struggle, 
lasting  nearly  two  hours,  but  Dana  was  the  more  versatile  and.  with  a 
sudden  change  of  attack,  ran  out  the  deciding  set,  6/4.  The  other  match 
was  between  Stanley  Ilenshaw  and  J.  O.  Ames.  Henshaw  was  erratic, 
however,  and  could  make  but  little  headway  against  his  plodding  oppo- 
nent.     Ames   was  very   steady   and   sound    on   all    his  shots. 

Dana  outclassed  Ames  in  the  final.  His  driving  was  splendid  and  his 
tactics  bevond  criticism.  Ames  tried  for  everything  and  usually  got  the 
ball  back' if  it  was  at  all  playable,  but  he  lacked  a  good  killing  stroke 
and   was    too    much    on    the   defensive. 

In  the  challenge  round  Jones  played  a  remarkable  game.  He  was 
steadiness  personified,  but  not  at  the  cost  of  speed.  His  volleying  was 
sharp   and    his    forehand   drive   under   perfect   control.      Dana    was   a   shade

off   in    the    early    part    of    the    match,    but    rapidly   grew    worse.      Jones    was 
never   extended   to   the   limit   and   won   at   63,   6/3,   6/1. 

In  the  doubles  Jones  and  Hensliaw  joined  forces  and  proved  too  fast 
for  the  holders  of  the  title.  Gross  and  Dana.  It  was  fairly  even  for  two 
sets,  but  the  challengers  swamped  their  rivals  in  third  and  fourth.  The

Tri-State  Championship. 


After  repeated  but  unsuccessful  assaults  on  the  Tri-State  championship 
title  (Ohio,  Kentucky  and  Indiana).  R.  H.  Palmer  finally  succeeded  in 
accomplishing  his  desire  when,  on  September  6,  he  defeated  W.  F.  Johnson 
in  the  final  round.  As  Robert  LeRoy  did  not  ajipear  to  defend  the  honors 
he  won  in    19 10,    Palmer  took   the  title  by  default. 

The  huge  number  of  ninety-two  entries  were  drawn  for  the  singles,  but 
nevertheless  the  class  of  play  which  was  provided  when  Little,  Collins, 
LeRoy  and  other  cracks  used  to  compete  was  absent,  and  there  were  but 
few   really  good   men   in   the  list. 

There  was  little  excitement  in  the  process  of  eliminating  the  weaker  men, 
which  continued  for  two  rounds,  but  in  the  third  there  were  several  good 
matches.  The  veteran  Oklahoma  champion,  John  T.  Bailey,  gave  Trux 
Emerson  the  fight  of  his  life.     Emerson   pulled  out  the  deciding  set  finally 


108  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

at  II,  9.  Bailey  was  tour  times  within  a  point  of  victory,  but  could  not 
put  over  the  finishing  sliot.  K.  Bishop  was  in  great  shape  and  disposed 
of  Dr.   Hawk  in  short  order  at  6/2,  6/2. 

The  only  interesting  feature  of  the  fourth  round  was  the  unexpected 
defeat  of  A.  S.  Sweetser  by  John  Wentzell,  but  the  fifth  produced  several 
splendid  matches  and  two  form  reversals.  Bishop  in  that  round  won  as  he 
chose  from  Nat  Thornton.  The  Bostonian's  drives  were  excellent,  and 
Thornton's  net  game  was  badly  broken  up.  Wentzell,  who  had  attracted 
attention  by  his  defeat  of  Sweetser,  gave  R.  A.  Holden  a  good  fight  and 
won  the  first  two  sets.  His  steady  driving  was  too  much  for  the  Yale 
champion  and  the  latter  was  forced  into  repeated  errors  by  constant  run- 
ning in.  Holden,  after  two  sets  had  slipped  away,  changed  his  game. 
Playing  from  the  back  court  and  dropping  short  shots  just  over,  he  soon 
had  Wentzell  on  the  run  and  came  through  the  remaining  three  sets  with 
plenty  of  margin  to  spare.  Practically  the  same  thing  happened  in  the  W. 
F.  Johnson-W.  M.  Hall  match.  For  two  sets  Hall  had  all  the  better  of 
the  argument,  but  his  constant  net  work  wore  him  down,  and  he  was 
never  dangerous  after  that.  Johnson's  wonderfully  controlled  chop  slid 
past  him  with  clock-like  regularity  and  Hall  lacked  the  speed  and  endur- 
ance necessary  to  cope  with  it.  In  the  remaining  match  Palmer  outclassed 
C.   O.   Benton. 

The  semi-final  was  a  great  disappointment  to  everyone  for,  unfortu- 
nately, K.  A.  Holden  was  foiced  to  withdraw  in  order  to  reach  the  scene 
of  the  intercollegiate  tournament  on  time.  His  match  with  Johnson  was 
looked  foiward  to  as  the  feature  of  the  event  and  his  default  caused  keen 
regret.  The  remaining  match  proved  thrilling  enough  for  anyone,  how- 
ever, although  Palmer  was  conceded  a  win  by  everyone.  Bishop  put  up  a 
remarkable   fight. 

Palmer  struck  his  gait  immediately,  and  by  fast  driving  took  the  first 
set,  6/3.  Bishop,  however,  was  improving  with  every  stroke,  and  with  the 
second  set  had  his  shots  working  splendidly.  Driving  deep,  fast  balls  to 
Palmer's  backhand,  he  won  game  after  game.  The  set  went  to  him  at  6/2 
and  he  led  at  4/1  in  the  third.  Palmer  came  like  a  steam  engine  then, 
taking  four  games  and  the  lead,  but  Bishop  was  too  steady  and  won  three 
games  in  succession.  The  fourth  set  was  very  even,  and  three  times 
Bishop  was  within  a  point  of  taking  it,  but  Palmer  pulled  it  out  with 
clever  drives  and  finally  evened  the  score  by  winning  at  8/6.  Bishop's 
shots  lacked  sting  in  the  fifMi   set  and  Palmer   had  it  safely  all  through. 

The  final  was  a  great  contest  from  beginning  to  end.  Johnson  started 
well  and  ran  up  a  lead  of  5/1  and  40/0  before  Palmer  found  himself. 
Then  the  left-hander  began  to  overhaul  the  Philadelphian,  and  to  the  sur- 
prise of  the  immense  gallery  pulled  the  set  out  at  11/9.  Tlie  second  was 
very  close,  but  Palmer  was  a  little  better,  winning  at  0/4.  Johnson  tried 
everything  in  the  thiid  and  did  succeed  in  taking  the  lead  at  z/^^  but  at 
that  point  Palmer  started  another  burst  of  speed  and  Johnson  was  forced 
down  slowly  but  surely.  The  match  went  to  the  southpaw  at  11/9,  6/4,  6/3. 
Johnson  was  very  good  for  one  set,  but  his  game  fell  oli  as  Palmer's 
improved  and   he   was  unable   to   steady   himself  at  any   time. 

The    doubles    provided    much    good    tennis    but    little    excitement,    for    the  , 
superiority   of   Johnson   and    Palmer   in   one   half   and   Bishop   and    Sweetser 
in    the    other    was    generally    conceded.      As    expected,    neither    team    came 
close  to  defeat,  although   Sweetser  and  Bishop  were   led  in  their  match  with 
Thornton   and  Marty  by   two  sets  to  one. 

The  final  was  a  corker.  Johnson  and  Palmer  had  a  little  the  better  of 
the  first  two  sets,  winning  them  at  8/6  and  6/4.  The  pinch  came  in  the 
fourth,  when  with  Sweetser  serving,  the  score  steed  at  4/s  and  0/40.  But 
several  long  chances  came  oft"  as  hoped  for  and  the  Boston  pair  took  the 
set  at  8/6.  The  fifth  set  was  even  at  three-all,  but  Sweet.ser  gave  out 
suddenly,  and  Bishop,  too,  seemed  on  the  verge  of  collapse.  Palmer  and 
Johnson  were  in  better  shape  by  far,  and  had  little  trouble  in  running  out 
the  balance.     The  summaries:

Virginia  State  Championship. 

On  June  20,  1910,  at  the  Country  Club,  Norfolk,  Va.,  the  tenth  annual 
tournament  for  the   championship   of  the   State   was  begun. 

There  were  few  visiting  cracks,  but  the  ])resence  of  Nat  Thornton, 
ex-Southern   chami)ion,   made   up   for   that   deficiency. 

H.  G.  Whitehead,  playing  splendidly,  came  through  one  side  of  the 
draw,  winning  successively  from  W.  I.  Cooke,  Jr.,  C.  F.  Mcintosh,  and 
B.  M.  Grant.  He  dropped  a  set  to  Mcintosh,  had  hard  work  with  Cooke 
and   against   Grant,    supposedly   his   worthiest   opponent,    won   at   6/2,   6/1. 

Thornton  had  little  difficulty  in  winning  his  way  through  the  other 
side,  but  after  splitting  the  first  two  sets  with  Whitehead  was  outclassed 
in  the  third  and  fourth.  Whitehead's  driving  was  fast  and  steady  and 
overhead   he    was   deadly. 

A  stiff  breeze  hampered  the  work  of  both  Whitehead  and  J.  H.  Winston, 
the  title  holder,  in  the  challenge  match.  Winston  was  in  great  form, 
however,  and  set  a  pace  so  fast  that  Whithead  was  killed  off  after  two 
sets.  The  challenger  won  the  second  at  6/3,  bjt  Winston  was  irresistible 
and    took    the   third   and   fourth    by   wider   margins. 

The  feature  of  the  tournament  was  the  meeting  in  the  doubles  of  the 
ex-Southern  champions.  Thornton  and  Grant,  and  Winston  and  Whitehead. 
These   teams   outclassed   the   rest   of   the   field  and   tlieir   match    in    the   final 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  113 

was  a  great  exhibition.  The  Atlanta  pair  started  well,  winning  the  first 
two  sets  at  7/5,  but  by  brillant  play  the  V'irginians  annexed  the  third 
and  fourth.  The  fifth  set  was  hard  fought,  but  the  latter  pair  held  a. 
one-game  lead  to  6/4.  The  tenth  game  was  fast,  but  an  error  of  Grant's 
and  a  terrific  cross-court  drive  of  Winston's  settled  the  match.  The

114  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

West  Virginia  State  Championship. 

The  fifth  annual  invitation  tennis  tournament  for  the  championship  of 
West  Virginia  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Parkersburg  Country  Club, 
August   22,    23   and   24,    1910. 

Ideal  weather  conditions  and  perfect  courts,  coupled  with  a  splendid 
entry  list  and  sterling  tennis,  brought  out  large  galleries  of  enthusiastic 
spectators. 

The  visiting  players  were  entertained  on  the  evening  of  the  second  day 
with  a  sumptuous  banquet,  and  the  tournament  was  brought  to  a  close 
with  a  brilliant  dance  given  in  honor  of  the  players  on  the  evening  of 
the    third    day. 

By  clever  play  in  their  respective  halves,  R.  E.  Bowie  of  Wheeling  and 
Kd  H anion  of  Sistersville  met  in  the  final  round,  but,  owing  to  illness, 
Hanlon  was  compelled  to  default.  This  gave  Bowie  the  right  to  chal- 
lenge Eveiett  Drennen  of  Fairmont,  W.  \'a.,  holder  of  the  cup,  but  the 
challenge  round  was  a  disappointment  to  a  great  many,  as  Bowie  seemed 
to  be  unable  to  get  going,  and  Drennen.  who  was  right  on  his  game,  won 
in  straight  sets,  6/3,  6 '3,  61,  thus  giving  him  his  third  win  and  per- 
manent  possession   of  the   challenge   cup. 

The  doubles  event  was  won  by  Everett  Drennen  and  J.  O.  Watson  of 
Fairmont  against  R.  A.  Johnson  and  J.  ^V.  Shrewsbury  of  Parkersburg  in 
the   final   round    score,   7/5,   6/2,   6/1. 

Handsome  racket  cases  were  presented  to  R.  E.  Bowie  and  Ed  Hanlon, 
the  winner  and  runner-up,  respectively,  in  the  singles,  and  beautiful  cups 
and  gold  watch  fol)s  to  Everett  Drennen,  J.  O.  Watson,  R.  A. 
Johnson  and  J.  A.  Shrewsbury,  winners  and  runners-up  in  the  doubles. 
Silver  flasks  were  presented  to  Messrs.  Cummins,  winner  of  the  consola- 
tion singles,  and  to  Kennedy  and  Hanlon,  winners  of  the  consolation 
doubles.

Massachusetts  State  Championship. 

After  repeated  but  vain  attempts  to  annex  the  Massachusetts  State  title, 
N.  W.  Niles  finally  succeeded  in  adding  that  to  his  numerous  laurels  when 
he  went  through  the  tournament  played  at  Longwood  early  in  June  and 
dislodged  the  title  holder,  R.  C.  Seaver,  from  the  position  he  had  so  well 
retained   for   five    years. 

The  field  was  practically  the  same  that  has  competed  for  several  years. 
Taut  the  play  was  productive  of  numerous  upsets  and  men  conceded  a 
chance  for  the  title  went  down  before  others  who  received  but  little  con- 
sideration. The  first  round  brought  out  the  most  notable  of  these  form 
reversals  when  Arthur  Sweetser  defeated  T.  J.  Sulloway.  The  latter  had 
the  match  won,  but,  when  within  a  point  of  losing,  Sweetser  braced  and 
finally  pulled  out  at  4/6,  11/9.  97.  A.  S.  Dabney  defeated  C.  F.  Johnson 
in  the  same  round,  and  in  the  one  following  H.  C.  Johnson  upset 'calcula- 
tions by  winning  from  Harry  Holt.  The  latter  "was  unable  to  drive 
Johnson's  chops  and,  with  his  forehand  out  of  commission.  Holt  had 
much   the   worst  of  it. 

Dick  Bishop  was  the  next  unsuccessful  opponent  of  Johnson,  and  the 
best  match  of  the  tournament  followed  between  Niles  and  Dabney.  The 
men  both  were  in  such  splendid  form  that  it  was  the  prettiest  kind  of 
tennis,  but  Dabney's  old  weakness,  unsteadiness,  was  in  evidence,  and 
Niles    won    in   straight    sets. 

The  semi-finals  brought  together  S.  L.  Beals,  who  had  struck  Sweetser 
in  wretched  form,  and  Niles.  while  Johnson  bracketed  with  H.  Nickerson. 
Niles  made  short  work  of  Beals,  but  Johnson  was  slow  in  starting  against 
the  Harvard  player.  The  latter  played  a  fast,  sure  net  game,  and  it  was 
not  until  Johnson  changed  his  shots  to-  lobs  and  short  drops  that  Nickerson 
weakened.  The  change  in  pace  proved  very  effective,  and  until  Johnson 
•decided  to  try  it  his  opponent  had   much  tlie  better  of  it. 

The  final  between  Niles  and  Johnson  was  not  so  one-sided  as  the  score 
of  6/3,  6/0,  6/3  would  indicate.  Johnson  played  his  usual  steady,  sure 
game  but  Niles  w^as  never  in  better  stroke.  His  speed  alone  was  too 
much  for  his  opponent,  although  rather  numerous  errors  gave  Johnson's 
point  scor!  a  good  boost.  Niles  was  all  over  the  court  and,  in  view  of 
the   pace   he   established,   misplayed  surprisingly   few   shots. 

The  challenge  round  resulted  as  it  did  because  of  two  things — Niles* 
splendid  delivery  and  Seaver's  weak  one.  Only  once  did  Seaver  break 
through,  and  that  was  in  a  game  in  which  Niles  made  six  errors.  The 
■champion  was  continually  on  the  defensive,  and  his  remarkable  ability 
to  get  almost  anything  was  of  little  value.  Niles  did  not  play  a  safe 
^ame,  yet  he  succeeded  in  getting  away  with  most  sensational  shots.  That 
streak  reached  its  height  in  the  middle  of  the  match,  when  Niles  ran 
eleven  successive  games  with  a  point  score  of  44  to  Seaver's  14.  The 
acore    was    a    duplicate    of    that    made    in   the    final,    6/3,    6/0,    6/3.

Massachusetts  State  Doubles. 

N.  W.  Niles  and  A.  S.  Dabney  added  another  victory  to  their  long  list 
■when,  on  June  i,  they  won  the  Massachusetts  doubles  championship  on 
the   Brae    Burn   Country   Club   courts  of   West   Newton. 

As  Beals  Wright,  the  holder,  with  F.  J.  Sulloway,  was  in  Europe,  there 
was  no  challenge  match,  but  Sulloway  paired  with  D.  P.  Rhodes  and 
came  through   to   the   final. 

The  match  was  close  and  extremely  interesting,  but  the  quality  of  the 
tennis  played  was  of  a  low  order.  Not  one  of  the  four  was  in  true  form 
and  the  team  work  of  both  combinations  was  at  times  deplorable.  Each 
man  would  occasionally  strike  a  brilliant  streak,  but  as  these  never  came 
in  unison  they  were  of  little  value.  For  four  sets  there  was  nothing  to 
choose,  but  in  the  liith  Sulloway  and  Rhodes  fell  off  decidedly  and  Niles 
and    Dabney   had  much  the   better   of   it. 

Both  teams  had  a  narrow  escape  in  the  early  rounds,  for  in  their  first 
match  Sulloway  and  Rhodes  met  R.  C.  Seaver  and  R.  Bishop.  The  latter 
won  tlie  tirst  set  and  had  a  good  chance  for  the  third,  but  Rhodes* 
improvement   at   the   right  moment   saved   the   day. 

In  the  semi-tinals  Niles  and  Dabney  faced  the  Johnson  brothers,  H.  C. 
and  C.  F.  The  steadiness  and  headwork  of  this  pair  is  well  known  and 
they  all  but  won  in  a  tiiree-set  liglit.  Niles  was  painfully  bad  on  ground 
strokes,  but  Dabney  was  quite  consistent.  They  won  at  6/4,  3/6,  7/5.

New  Jersey  State  Championship. 

Richard  H.  Palmer,  title  holder,  met  and  defeated  Fred  G.  Anderson, 
tournament  winner,  in  the  challenge  round  of  the  New  Jersey  State  Cham- 
pionship tournament.  The  match  went  four  sets,  and  throughout  the 
tournament  Anderson  displayed  flashes  of  his  old-time  form.  The  tour- 
nament was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Morristown  Field  Club,  September  12. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  119 

An  interesting  match  occurred  in  the  tliird  round,  between  Anderson 
and  Henry  Mollenhauer.  lioth  men  are  veterans  of  the  Kings  County 
Tennis  Club,  Brooklyn,  and  both  displayed  something  of  their  old-time 
skill.      Anderson    won.   after   a   hard   tight,    at   6/2,    3/6,   7/5. 

The  men  to  reach  the  semi-final  round  were  Anderson,  B.  M.  Phillips, 
Ci.  C.  Thomas,  Jr..  and  L.  S.  Freeman,  In  the  upper  bracket  Anderson 
easily  defeated  Phillips,  while  Thomas,  in  the  lower  bracket,  had  no  trouble 
in  conquering   Freeman. 

In  the  final  round  Anderson  forced  matters  all  through.  As  of  old,  he 
played  entirely  from  the  back-court,  and  had  his  young  adversary  running 
all  over  the   court,   passing  him   whenever  he   took  "the   net. 

Palmer  defeated  Anderson,  in  the  challenge  round,  in  an  excellent  exhi- 
bition. Both  men  had  two  legs  on  the  challenge  cup,  and  as  the  winner 
was  to  have  permanent  possession  of  it,  they  put  forth  every  effort,  Palmer 
finally   winning. 

Anderson  and  Mollenhauer  and  Otto  Hinck  and  S.  H.  Voshell  easily 
came  through  to  the  final  round  in  the  doubles  without  having  lost  any 
sets.  The  upset  of  the  event  occurred  in  the  final  round,  however,  when* 
Hinck  and  \'oshell  won  in  straight  sets,  6/2,  6/2. 

Miss  Esther  Smith  won  the  ladies'  singles,  defeating  Mrs.  Aufermann 
in  a  good   match  in  the  final  round,  O/2,   6/4.  6/2. 

Miss  Marie  Wagner  easily  won  the  challenge  round,  defeating  Miss 
Smith,  62,  6/1. 

The  ladies'  doubles  were  won  by  Miss  Marie  Wagner  and  Miss  E.  C. 
Bunce.  In  the  final  round  they  defeated  Mrs.  W.  Aufermann  and  Miss

The  Golf  and  Country  Ckib  of  Des  Moines  was  the  scene  of  the  fifth 
annual   championship   of    Iowa.      Play   began   August   27. 

It  was  generally  conceded  that  this  was  the  best  Iowa  State  tournament 
that  has  ever  been  held.  There  were  fifty  entries  in  the  singles  and  out 
of  this  list  but  three  defaults.  There  were  twenty-five  pairs  in  the  doubles. 
There  were  iilayers  from  St.  Louis,  Omaha,  Sioux  City,  Oklahoma.  Texas, 
etc.  Fred  Bradley  of  Des  Moines,  Iowa,  who  won  the  1909  championship 
in  singles,  and  Messrs.  Gilman  and  Carey,  who  won  the  championship  in 
doubles,  were  again  the  winners.  Cub  Potter  of  Omaha  was  the  chal- 
lenger in  singles,  and  Messrs.  Bradley  of  Des  Moines  and  Rogers  of 
Hartford,    Conn.,    were    the   challengers   in   doubles. 

There  are  four  courts  at  the  Country  Club,  conceded  to  be  the  finest 
clay  courts  in  the  Middle  West.  The  same  committee  has  been  elected 
for  191 1  and  the  tournament  this  year  is  expected  to  be  the  biggest  and

SPALDING'S    I.AWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  133 


Miscellaneous   Tournaments 


Metropolitan  Championship. 

What  was  probably  the  greatest  collection  of  tennis  stars  that  ever  played 
in  a  tournament  around  New  York  was  that  enrolled  in  the  entry  list  of 
the  Metropolitan  Championship,  which  was  held  for  the  first  time  on  turf 
courts,  at  the  new  grounds  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  near  Van  Cort- 
landt  Park.  Xf)t  for  many  years  had  New  York  teiuiis  enthusiasts 
the  opportunity  of  watching  the  performances  of  the  national  champion, 
William  A.  Larned.  but  because  of  his  numerous  friends  in  the  club,  he 
was  finally  prevailed  upon  to  take  part  in  the  tournament.  R.  D.  Little 
and  F.  1\.  Alexander  were  among  the  competitors,  the  latter  playing  in  his 
only  singles  tournament  of  the  season,  and  besides  such  men  as  C.  R. 
Gardner,  T.  R.  Pell  and  G.  F.  Touchard,  the  occasion  called  forth  the 
reappearance  of  the  veterans,  E.  P.  Fischer  and  Ross  Burchard,  both 
ex-Metropolitan  champions,   and   E.  W.   Leonard. 

Play  began  on  June  18  and  fortunately  the  draw  was  very  even.  Form 
prevailed  throughout  the  first  round,  all  the  men  mentioned  winning  their 
preliminary  matches  quite  easily.  In  the  second  round  T.  K.  Pell  disposed 
of  his  very  formidable  antagonist,  W.  B.  Cragin,  Jr.,  for  the  first  time  in 
three  meetings.  He  accomplished  the  feat  quite  easily,  however,  in  straight 
sets,  winning  at  6/3,  6/0.  In  the  third  round  Leonard  and  Fischer  came 
together.  Neither  man  was  in  particularly  good  conditicm,  but  Leonard 
lasting  better  than  his  famous  opjionent,  won  the  match  at  4/6,  6/4,  6/3. 
Gardner  won  an  easy  match  from  Wylie  C.  Grant  on  the  adjoining  court, 
and  Touchard  had  his  hands  full  in  disposing  of  W.  M.  Hall.  The  former's 
troublesome  path  was  continued,  when,  in  his  next  match.  Bull  all  but  beat 
him  in  three  sets.  Gardner's  victim  was  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.,  who  made  but 
little  headway  against  him,  and  Ross  Burchard  outplayed  E.  W.  Leonard 
in  the  final  set  of  their  match.  The  match  of  the  round  was  that  between 
Pell  and  Little.  Pell  was,  for  him,  remarkably  steady,  while  on  the  other 
hand.  Little  wasted  his  efforts  in  a  hopeless  endeavor  to  strike  his  gait. 
This  he  failed  to  accomplish  and,  largely  because  of  his  rival's  errors. 
Pell   was  enabled   to   win  in   straight   sets,   6/4,   6/3. 

The  one  bad  upset  came  in  the  following  round  when  Touchard  quite 
unexpectedly  put  Alexander  out  of  the  running.  For  almost  two  sets 
Alexander  outclassed  his  young  opponent,  but  carelessness  when  within  a 
point  of  victory,  cost  him  the  match.  Due  to  his  almost  total  lack  of 
practice  he  slumped  badly.  His  return  of  service  was  very  weak,  while 
he  just  managed  to  hold  his  own  delivery.  At  lo-all  Touchard  broke 
through  Alexander's  service  and  won  his  own  for  the  set.  The  third  set 
was  very  one-sided.  Alexander,  badly  off,  continued  to  go  down  hill,  and 
principally  by  simply  getting  the  ball  back  and  allowing  Alexander  to  make 
errors,   Touchard    won   the   set,   6/2. 

JJp  to  the  time  of  the  semi-final  round  nobody  had  succeeded  in  even 
extending  Champion  Larned,  but  when  he  faced  C.  R.  Gardner  there  was 
a  different  story  to  tell.  The  latter,  apparently  realizing  that  he  had  every- 
thing to  gain,  started  in  A'ith  a  rush,  and  almost  before  the  enormous 
crowd  of  spectators  realized  what  was  happening,  had  jumped  into  a  lead 
of  5/2.  During  that  time  of  the  match  he  came  into  the  net  on  every 
opportunity,  and  his  volleying  was  really  remarkable.  Larned  could  do 
Tcry  little  with  it,  and  in  his  few  attempts  to  gain  the  net,  was  passed  by 
an  accurate,  fast  chop.  It  was  at  that  point  in  the  match  that  an  accident 
to  Larned  marred  what  every  indication  pointed  to  be  the  best  of  the  tour- 
nament.    In  an  attempt  to  reach  a  lob  which  Gardner  sent  away  over  his 


m  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

head,  Larned's  knee  gave  way  and  he  drew  up  lame.  At  the  time  not  even 
ne  realized  the  extent  of  his  injury,  but  it  was  not  long  after  that  it  was 
obvious  serious  trouble  had  befallen  him.  The  mishap  had  its  effect  on 
Gardner,  and  his  game  slowed  up  perceptibly,  but  finally,  at  6-all,  he  braced 
and  ran  out  the  following  two  games  for  the  tirst  set  of  the  match. 
Larned  continued  after  a  brief  rest,  but  confined  his  work  entirely  to  base 
line  play.  In  this  for  a  while  he  was  not  successful,  and  Gardner  ran  the 
score  up  to  3/1.  From  then  on  the  games  alternated.  At  7-aIl  Larned,  by 
clever  driving,  succeeded  in  breaking  Gardner's  service,  and  followed  it  by 
taking  his  own,  the  last  point  on  a  service  ace.  The  third  set  was  close, 
but  with  Larned  always  having  a  little  the  better  of  it.  The  accident 
seemed  to  affect  Gardner  more  than  it  did  Larned,  and,  for  that  reason, 
his  game   slumped   badly.      The   final   score   was  6/8,  9/7,   6/3. 

In  the  meantime  Touchard  had  succeeded  in  disposing  of  Pell  in  straight 
sets,  thereby  gaining  his  place  in  the  final  round.  Owing  to  Larned's  injury 
this  match  was  postponed  for  over  three  weeks,  and,  when  it  was  played, 
it  was  a  most  one-sided  affair.  Larned  had  in  the  meantime  completely 
recovered  and  played  a  wonderful  game,  while  on  the  other  hand  Touchard 
played  considerably  below  his  own  standard.  In  the  three  sets  the  latter 
succeeded  in  winning  but  two  games,  and  it  was  a  disappointed  crowd  who 
left  the  court  after  having  expected  to  witness  a  match  that  would  at  least 
approach  a  contest.      The  summaries:

A  good  many  defaults  marred  the  doubles  entry,  but  fortunately  these 
did  not  include  any  very  strong  team.  In  the  first  round,  what  was  probably 
the  best  match  was  that  played  between  Cragin  and  Hall  and  the  Leonard 
brothers,  E.  W.  and  C.  The  former  team  won  in  a  very  even  three-set 
match.  Touchard  and  Gardner  dropped  the  second  set  of  their  match  with 
C.  F.  Watson,  Jr.,  and  F.  DeRham,  but  won  the  third  easily  at  6/0.  In 
the  second  round  Hackett  and  Alexander  had  no  difficulty  in  disposing  of 
the  Washburn  brothers,  and  Grant  and  Pell  took  the  measure  of  O.  H. 
Hinck  and  II.  Torrance,  Jr.,  in  a  very  well  played  match.  The  surprise 
of  the  day  came  with  the  defeat  of  Touchard  and  Gardner  by  Cragin  and 
Hall.  After  coming  within  a  point  of  winning  in  the  third  set,  the  former 
team  allowed  the  Seventh  Regiment  combination  to  tie  the  score  at  5-all, 
and  the  latter  finally  won  the  set  at  12/10.  For  the  second  time  in  the 
season  the  Crescent  pair,  Bull  and  Martin,  got  away  with  the  first  set  of 
their  match  with  Hackett  and  Alexander,  but  the  National  title-holders 
swamped  their  opponents  in  the  second  and  third,  losing  but  a  game  in 
each.  The  remaining  teams  to  come  through  were  Grant  and  Pell,  Cragin 
and  Hall,  and  E.  P.  Fischer  and  R.  D.  Little.  Cragin  and  Hall  defaulted 
their  match  in  the  semi-final  to  Little  and  Fischer,  refusing  to  begin  their 
match  after  having  played  two  rounds  earlier  in  the  day,  but  in  the 
remaining  semi-final  Hackett  and  Alexander  outclassed  Grant  and  Pell  in 
the  deciding  set  of  their  match. 

The  final  was  played  before  the  largest  gallery  of  the  week,  on  Monday,. 
June  27.  The  champions  made  short  work  of  the  first  set,  but  went  a  bit 
off  in  the  second,  just  squeezing  through  by  a  score  of  7/5.  In  the  third, 
after  losing  the  first  few  games,  they  made  but  little  effort  to  cut  down 
the  lead  held  by  Fischer  and  Little,  with  the  result  that  the  latter  pair 
took  the  set  at  6/3.  In  the  fourth,  however,  Hackett  and  Alexander 
started  with  a  rush  and  by  hard  hitting  and  few  errors  had  things  much 
their  own  way.     The  summaries:

Annual  Seabright  Invitation  Tournament. 

The  usual  small  but  high-class  entry  list  was  drawn  for  the  annual  Sea- 
bright  invitation  tournament  which  was  begun  on  July  ii  at  the  Seabright 
Lawn  Tennis  and  Cricket  Club.  W.  J.  Clothier,  the  successful  defender  of 
1909,  was  forced  through  illness  to  default,  and  for  the  second  time  N.  W. 
Niles  came  through  the  tournament. 

In  the  first  round  of  singles  several  defaults  upset  the  calculations  of 
the  committee  in  charge,  but  of  the  matches  played  the  best  was  that  in 
which  C.  R.  Gardner  took  the  measure  of  L.  E.  Mahan.  The  feat  was  not 
accomplished  without  difficulty,  Mahan  winning  the  first  set,  10/8,  and 
leading  at  43  in  the  second.  Gardner,  however,  won  that  and  the  follow- 
ing set  easily  at  6/2.  In  the  same  round  R.  D.  Little  outclassed  F.  F. 
DeRham,  an'd  T.  R.  Pell  won  a  good  contest  from  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr. 
A.  S.  Dabney  and  C.  F.  Watson,  Jr.,  were  the  remaining  winners,  each 
disposing  of  his  opponent  in   straight  sets. 

It  required  three  sets  to  decide  all  of  the  second  round  matches.  Touchard, 
after  getting  all  the  worst  of  his  set  with  Ganlner  in  the  first  half,  won 
because  of  the  latter's  unaccountable  slump,  and  Pell  duplicated  his  per- 
formance in  the  Metropolitan  tournament,  where  he  defeated  Little  in  a 
fast  three-set  match.  In  the  bottom  section  Dabney  won  rather  easily 
from  Watson,  and  Niles  had  all  the  better  of  the  argument  with  his  old 
rival,  W.  F.  Johnson.  The  semi-final  brought  together  Touchard  and  Pell, 
and    Niles    and    Dabney.      In    his    match    wi^h   Touchard.    Pell    never    had   a 


138  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

chance,  but  Dabney  came  within  two  points  of  disposing  of  his  doubles 
partner.  Always  an  erratic  player,  Dabney  had  one  of  his  good  days,  and 
had  not  over-anxiety  gotten  the  better  of  him,  he  might  easily  have  won  his 
match,  for  on  each  occasion,  when  being  within  two  points,  he  was  given 
the  opportunity  for  an  easy  kill. 

The  final,  which  was  played  on  Saturday,  was  a  long-winded  affair 
between  Touchard  and  Niles.  The  first  two  sets  were  divided,  but  Niles 
won  the  third  only  after  having  twice  been  within  a  point  of  letting  it  go. 
The  score  of  that  set  was  12,  lo.  After  a  much-needed  and  lengthy  rest 
he  again  appeared  on  the  court  and  had  little  difficulty  in  winning  the 
fourth  set  at  6/3. 

Plight  teams  took  part  in  the  doubles,  principal  among  them  being  the 
national  champions,  Hackett  and  Alexanaer.  In  their  first  match  they 
faced  E.  W.  Leonard  and  C.  R.  Gardner.  The  first  set  went  to  them,  6/4, 
but  the  second  they  lost,  10/8.  In  the  third,  by  a  phenomenal  burst  of 
speed  on  Alexander's  part,  they  hopelessly  outdistanced  Leonard  and  Gard- 
ner, winning  at  6/1.  The  closest  match  of  the  round  was  that  between 
G.  L.  Wrenn  and  W.  A.  Larned  and  Niles  and  Dabney.  All  three  sets 
went  to  7/5.  Pell  and  B.  S.  Prentice  made  short  work  of  Holden  and 
Watrous,  but  another  match,  in  which  the  deciding  set  required  twelve 
games,  was  that  in  which  Little  and  K.  H.  Behr  put  W.  F.  Johnson  and 
L.  E.  Mahan  out  of  the  running.  In  the  semi-final  round  Wrenn  and 
Larned  defeated  Pell  and  Prentice,  6/2,  2/6,  6/2,  and  Hackett  and  Alex- 
ander, when  put  to  the  test,  proved  far  too  strong  for  Little  and   Behr. 

By  far  the  largest  crowd  which  attended  the  tournament  turned  out  for 
the  doubles  final,  and  their  hopes  of  a  close  contest  were  fully  realized. 
The  first  two  sets  were  divided  each  at  6/3.  and  the  test  came  in  the  third. 
Neither  team  could  gain  much  advantage  until  7-all  was  reached,  at  which 
point  Wrenn  was  made  the  target  of  the  title-holders'  shots.  Larned  was 
left  severely  alone  during  that  time  of  play,  and  Wrenn  proved  unequal  to 
the  task  forced  upon  him.  The  rest  following  the  set  did  much  for  Alex- 
ander, who,  all  through  had  been  playing  a  dashing  game  which  had  weak- 
ened him  in  no  small  degree.  Getting  into  the  play  again  with  a  reckless 
disregard  for  safety,  he  outshone  his  opponents  and  relieved  his  partner  of 
a  great  part  of  the  work.  The  score  of  the  fourth  set  was  6/2.  The 
summaries:

Westchester  Invitation  Doubles. 

Harold  H.   Ilackett  and   Fred.    B.   Alexander,   the   national   doubles   cham- 

?ions,  won  the  round  robin  invitation  tournament  at  the  Westchester 
:ountry  Club,  Westchester,  N.  V.,  which  started  on  July  5  and  ended 
July  9.  There  was,  of  course,  some  brilliant  tennis,  as  nearly  all  of  the 
teams    entered    were   composed    of   leading    players   of   the   country. 

In  their  first  match,  which  was  probably  the  best  of  the  tournament, 
Hackett  and  Alexander  lost  a  set  to  R.  D.  Little  and  Edgar  W.  Leonard. 
They  won  the  first  at  love,  but  eased  up  in  the  second,  while  Little  and 
Leonard  improved  rapidly,  taking  the  set  at  (>/4-  1'he  third  set  was 
intensely  fast  and  interesting.  Little  and  Leonard  got  a  lead  of  5/4  and 
were  within  two  points  of  the  match  at  the  critical  point,  but  were  unable 
to    win.      Ilackett  and   Alexander  won  this  set   at   7/5. 

R.  Fincke  and  C.  F.  Watson  defeated  the  Ciiicago  champions,  L.  H. 
W^aidncr  and  I'aul  E.  Gardner,  after  a  hard  fight  in  the  lirsi  set,  10/8. 
They    won   the   second   easier,   however,   the   score    being  6/3. 

On  Wednesday  Ilackett  and  Alexander  easily  defeated  Waidner  and 
Gardner  at  6/2,  6/3.  The  western  men  played  well,  but  were  completely 
outclassed.  Watson  and  Fincke  defeated  Little  and  Leonard  at  6/4,  7/5. 
The  match  was  a  good  one,  but  Little  and  Leonard,  after  the  first  day's 
play,  fell  off  considerably  for  the  rest  of  the  tournament,  not  scoring  a 
single  victory.  Waidner  and  Gardner  seemed  to  have  little  difficulty  in 
defeating   Little   and   Leonard   by   the   score   of   6/1,    6/4. 

On  Thursday  N.  Niks  and  A.  S.  Dabney  defeated  Waidner  and  Gardner 
in  an  excellent  two-set  match.  Both  the  sets  went  to  deuce  before  the 
former  team  was  able  to  win,  the  linal  score  being  9/7,  7/5.  Hackett  and 
Alexander  defeated  Watson  and  Fincke,  6/3,  6/3.  The  latter  team  played 
well,  but  were  unable  to  cope  with  the  champions  when  points  were 
needed  most.  In  the  afternoon  Niles  and  Dabney  won  from  Fincke  and 
Watson,  6/3,  9/7.  The  second  set  was  bitterly  contested,  but  Niles  and 
Dabney   proved  superior  to  their  opponents. 

On  Friday  the  only  match  played  was  between  Niles  and  Dabney  and 
Little  and  Leonard.  The  first  set  was  well  played  up  to  6/6,  but  at  this 
point  Little  and  Leonard  made  a  good  many  errors,  thus  losing  at  8/6. 
The  second  set  was  easily   won  by  Niles  and   Dabney,   the   score   being  6/3. 

Hackett  and  Alexander  and  Niles  and  Dabney  faced  each  other  on 
Saturday.  Neither  team  had  lost  a  match  and  this  caused  the  Bostonians 
to  work  from  start  to  finish.  Hackett  and  Alexander  won  the  first  set  at 
6/2,  but  they  eased  up  a  little  in  the  second,  while  Niles  and  Dabney 
improved.  This  resulted  in  some  pretty  play,  the  latter  team  f9rcing  the 
champions  to  an  8  6  set  before  the  match  was  won.  The  standing  at  the 
end  of  the  tournament  was  as  follows:

Carlton  R.  Gardrrer,  the  Californian,  had  a  rather  easy  time  in  the 
singles  event  of  the  Englewood  tournament,  defeating  Charles  M.  Bull,  Jr., 
in  the  final  round.  Bull,  after  defeating  Karl  Behr,  played  a  strong  game. 
He  lost  the  first  set  to  Gardner  at  a  score  of  6/4.  In  the  second,  how- 
ever, he  played  much  better,  losing  at  9/7,  after  having  been  within  one 
point   of  winning. 


SPALDING'S    LiWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  141 

The  most  interesting  match  of  the  tournament  was  the  semi-final  between 
Gardner  and  Fischer.  The  first  set  was  very  fast  and  both  men  won  their 
services  up  to  eight-all.  Gardner  broke  through  at  this  point  and  won 
the  set  at  10/8.  In  the  second  set  Fischer  was  not  quite  so  steady  and 
Gardner   w(^n  at   6/3. 

The  other  semi-final  was  quite  a  surprise.  In  this  match  Charles  M. 
Bull,  Jr.,  defeated  Karl  Behr,  the  winner  of  the  trophy  last  year,  in 
straight  sets.  lUill  played  a  brilliant  game,  but  Behr  was  rather  erratic 
throughout   the   match.      The   score   was   6/3,   o/ii. 

There  were  six  defaults  in  the  first  round  of  the  singles,  namely.  G.  F. 
Touchard.  Seymore  Johnson,  Edgar  Leo,  F.  F.  De  Kham,  P.  Martin  and 
r.   B.  Hawk. 

In  the  doubles  event  Hackett  and  Gardner  had  an  easy  time  up  to  the 
final  match,  when  they  met  the  internationalists,  Karl  Behr  and  R.  D. 
Little.  In  the  semi-finals  ITackett  and  Gardner  met  Bull  and  Church, 
whom  they  defeated  by  a  score  of  6/3,  62.  As  this  was  played  just 
after  Bull's  match  with  Behr,  he  was  rather  tired,  and  Church  was  very 
erratic.  This  resulted  in  llackett  and  (wirdner  having  their  own  way 
from  beginning  to  end.  In  the  other  semi-final  Behr  and  Little  defeated 
Watson  and  De  Rham.  They  were  slow  to  start,  Watson  and  De  Rham 
taking  a  lead  of  four-love,  but  the  internationalists  soon  "braced  up"  and 
w'on  the  set,  64.  The  second  set  was  an  easy  one  for  Behr  and  Little, 
as  their  opponents  only  got  one  game.  Thus,  the  match  went  to  Behr  and 
Little   at   the   score   of   6/4,   6/1. 

The  final  match  was  a  wonderful  exhibition  of  fast  tennis  from  start  to 
finish.  It  was  started  on  Thursday  afternoon,  just  after  the  semi-finals. 
As  all  four  players  were  on  the  tops  of  their  games,  and,  as  they  had  to- 
stop  on  account  of  darkness,  the  day  ended  with  honors  even.  llackett 
and  Gardner  won  the  first  set  at  a  score  of  6/4,  while  Behr  and  Little 
won  the  second  at  6/ 2.  The  ma'ch  was  not  resumed  until  the  following 
Monday.  As  the  players  were  still  at  their  best,  the  match  was  remark- 
ably fast.  Hackett  and  Gardner  won  the  first  set  at  11/9.  The  next 
went  to  Behr  and  Little,  at  7/5.  In  the  last  set,  however,  Hackett's  skill 
as  a  doubles  player  and  Gardner's  steadiness  won  the  set  for  them  at  a 
score  of  6/4. 

In  the  ladies'  singles  Miss  Hammond  defeated  Miss  Smith  in  the  semi- 
finals, reaching  the  final  round  without  having  lost  a  set.  In  this  round 
Mrs.   Chapman  defeated  Mrs.  Weaver  in  a  brilliant   match,  6/4,   6  '3. 

In  the  doubles  Mrs.  Chapman  and  Miss  Hammond  defeated  Mrs.  Auffer- 
man  and   Miss  Smith,   6/4,   6/1. 

Miss  Hammond  and  R.  D.  Little  defeated  Mrs.  Aufferman  and  Gardner 
in  the  finals  of  the  mixed  doubles,   7/5,  0/3,  after  an  interesting  match. 


Championship  of  Philadelphia  District. 

The  seventeenth  annual  championship  opened  September  10,  on  the  courts 
of  the  Belmont  Cricket  Club.  There  was  an  entry  list  of  sixty-four  players 
in  the  singles,  nearly  all  of  whom  were  Pennsylvania  men.  A  great  many 
of  these,  however,  were  players  of  class,  among  them  being  tiie  Rev.  H.  J. 
Kendall,  title  holder;  Wallace  Johnson,  Dr.  E.  B.  Dewhurst,  J.  R.  Car- 
penter, Jr..  W.   H.  Trotter.   H.    Biddle  and   W.   M.   Tilden. 

In  the  fourth  round  Dewhurst  defeated  P>iddle,  in  a  well  played  match, 
by  a  score  of  4/6,  6/4,  6/4.  Both  men  played  well  and  Dewhurst  showed 
flashes  of  his  old-time  form,  not  only  in  this  match  but  in  the  next  round, 
when  he  was  defeated  by  W.  M.  Tilden.  Tilden  took  the  first  set  at  6/3, 
but  Dewhurst  won  the  second  set,  6/1,  by  his  hard  drives  and  clever  head- 
Mork.  In  the  third  set  Dewhurst  was  unable  to  stand  the  pace  and  Tilden 
won.   6/3. 

In  the  semi-final  round   Wallace  Johnson  had  little  trouble  with  Tilden,. 


142  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

defeating  him  in  straiglit  sets,  6/0,  6/1.  W.  II.  Trotter  defeated  C.  C 
Willits  in  this  round  in  a   rather  interesting  three-set  match,   2/6,   6/1,   0/4. 

The  linal  round,  between  Johnson  and  Trotter,  was  rather  one-sided,  as 
Johnson  outclassed  his  opponent,  winning  at  the  score  of  6/1,  6/2,  6/1. 
The  light  was  poor  and   this   seemed  to   bother   Tilden. 

The  challenge  round  match  was  a  ver}'  good  one.  in  spite  of  the  threaten- 
ing weather.  Kendall  took  the  nrst  set  at  6,  3,  but  Johnson  did  not  seem 
to  be  quite  up  to  his  form.  In  the  second  set,  however,  both  men  played 
well  and  Johnson  won,  8  6.  The  third  and  fourth  sets  were  won  by 
Johnson,  d  4,  and  6/j.  Kendall  had  slackened  up  in  these  sets,  however, 
but  Johnson   seemed   to  improve. 

In  the  doubles  Tilden  and  1  hayer  defeated  Dewhurst  and  Carpenter  in 
the  finals.     They  played  well,   defeating  their  opponents,  7/5,  3/6,  6/3,  6/j. 

In  the  semi-tinal  round  Dewhurst  and  Carpenter  defeated  Biddle  and 
Gibbor.s,  6/2,  6/2,  vvhile  Tilden  and  A.  Thayer  defeated  Evans  and  E. 
Thayer,   6/4,   9/7.      The   summaries:

Central  Championship  Tournament. 

The  Central  Championship  tournament,  scheduled  for  July  4,  at  St. 
Louis,  Mo.,  was  held  on  the  sixteen  clay  courts  of  the  St.  Louis  Amateur 
Athletic  Association.  The  weather  conditions  made  it  impossible  to  start 
for  three  days,  however,  as  it  rained  steadily.  Owing  to  the  energetic 
-work  of  Robert  M.  Wilson,  chairman  of  the  tennis  committee,  the  singles 
were  finished  at  the  end  of  the  week,  only  holding  over  the  final  of  the 
doubles  for   ^he   following  week. 

Charles  S.  Peters  had  a  rather  easy  time  in  the  semi-final  round,  defeat- 
ing Osthaus  by  the  score  of  6/2,  7/5,  6/3.  In  this  round  Drummond 
Jones  defeated   Roland   Hoerr,    6/3.   .3/6.   6/3,    6/3. 

Jones  and  Peters  had  a  hard,  close  match  in  the  final  round,  both  men 
being  in  excellent  form  and  both  playing  brilliantly.  Jones  won  the  first 
two  sets,  7/5.  7/5,  but  Peters  managed  to  capture  the  next  two,  6/3,  6/3. 
In  the  fifth  set  Jones  got  a  lead  of  41.  but  Peters  braced  up  and  evened 
the  score  at  four-all.  Both  men  played  hard  from  then  on,  the  score 
running  up  to  eight-all.  Jones  proved  the  steadier  of  the  two,  however, 
by  taking  the   next  two  games,  thus  winning  the   set  and   match,  at   10/8. 

In  the  semi-final  round  of  the  doubles  Jones  and  Peters  had  a  rather 
€asy  match  against  Wilson  and  More,  winning  at  6/2,  6/4,  6/3.  Gamble 
and  Oliver  had  a  harder  battle  against  Hoerr  and  Smithers,  whom  they 
defeated  in  a  five-set  match,  6/1,  6/4,  4/6,   3/6,  6/0. 

The  final  round  was  a  wonderful  match  to  the  spectators.  All  four  men 
played  well,  Jones  and  Peters  finally  outpointing  their  opponents.  Gamble 
and  Oliver.  "The  tennis  was  fast  and  at  times  brilliant,  the  final  score 
being  9/7,   2/6,  6/4,  4/6,  6/4.     The  summaries:

Northeastern  Pennsylvania  Championship. 

The  erratic  course  of  F.  C.  Inman's  tennis  season  received  another 
check  when  George  A.  Lyon  of  Pittsburg  defeated  him  in  the  final  of 
the  Northeastern  Pennsylvania  Championships,  played  at  Scranton  in  Sep- 
tember. Inman  was  under  the  disadvantage  of  having  j)reviously  played 
and  lasted  for  only  two  sets.  During  that  time  he  outclassed  Lyon,  but 
the  latter  stuck  to  his  task  and  finally  pulled  through  a  winner  by  the 
score    of    3/6,    1/6,    0/4,    8/6,    6/3. 

G.  A.  paired  with  B.  Y.  V.  Lyon  in  the  doubles  and  again  proved  a 
stumbling  block  to  Inman's  aspirations.  The  latter  was  partnered  with 
G.    F.    Parrish,   but  the   Lyons  won   in   straight   sets.      The   summaries:

Western  New  York  Championship. 

Nat  W.  Niles  won  the  Western  New  York  championship,  defeating 
Wallace  Johnson  in  the  challenge  round.  The  tournament  was  held  on  the 
courts  of   the   Park   Club  at   Buffalo  during   the   week  of  August   29. 

Niles  and  Hodge  came  together  in  the  final  round,  and  it  must  be  said 
that  I  lodge  did  very  well  against  the  Bostonian  in  the  second  set.  The 
^core   was  6/1,    10/8,   6/1. 

In  the  challenge  round  Niles  defeated  Johnson  in  a  brilliant  four-set 
match.  Johnson  started  out  by  taking  the  first  set,  6/4,  but  Niles  took  the 
next  three,  75,  6,2,  7/5.  Both  men  played  well,  but  Niles  was  the 
steadier,  which  fact  accounts  for  his  victory. 

Baird  and  Hodge  won  the  doubles  event,  defeating  Jones  and  Hoerr  in 
a   hard  battle  in   the   final   round. 

Miss  Lois  Moyes  of  Toronto  won  the  ladies'  singles  in  surprisingly  easy 
style.  She  did  not  lose  a  set  throughout  the  tournament  and  was  never 
even   forced   to   extend   herself.     The   summaries:

Old   Dominion  Tennis  Tournament. 

The  sixth  annual  Old  Dominion  Tennis  Tournament  for  the  "Hermitage 
Challenge  Cups"  was  played  on  the  courts  of  the  Hermitage  Golf  Club  at 
Richmond,  \'a.,  during  the  week  of  June  13,  1910,  with  sixty-three  entries 
in  the  various  events.  This  tournament  again  retained  its  position  as  the 
most  important  tournament  in  the  South,  both  in  the  number  and  equality 
of  entries  attracted  to  it.  Fultilling  its  mission  of  providing  a  meeting 
place  for  players  from  the  North  and  South,  representative  players  from 
each  section  again  faced  each  other  across  the  net.  In  the  Fifth  Annual 
Tournament  the  North  made  a  clean  sweep  of  all  four  of  the  challenge 
cups  and  most  of  the  prizes,  but  in  1910  the  South  fared  better,  taking 
two  of  the  challenge  cups  and  a  fair  share  of  the  i)rizes.  Owing  to  the 
storm  prevailing  throughout  the  country  for  several  days  before  this  tour 
nanient  and  during  the  iirst  three  days  of  the  week,  a  number  of  the 
best  Northern  players  who  were  entered  were  prevented  from  being 
present  by  being  tied  up  in  otlier  tournaments.  R.  H.  Palmer  of  New 
Jersey  successfully  defended  his  title  to  the  Hermitage  Challenge  Cup  in 
men's  singles  against  Frank  J.  Hall  of  Lynchburg,  \'a.,  but  only  after  a 
very  close  match.  This  gives  Palmer  the  second  leg  upon  this  cup,  and 
he  is  the  only  player  who  has  ever  successfully  defended  his  title  during 
the  six  years  the  cup  has  been  offered.  In  191  i  the  tournament  will  be 
held  at  the  Country  Club  of  X'irginia,  Richmond,  \'a.,  which,  with  its 
enlarged  facilities  and  tine  courts,  will  be  able  to  take  care  of  all  the 
players  and   give   them   a   l":ne   time.      The    summaries:

Allegheny  Mountains  Championship. 

The  Rev.  IT.  T.  Rcmlall  of  Philadelphia  easily  won  the  tournament  for 
the  championship  of  the  Allegheny  Mountains,  coming  through  the  final 
round  without  the  loss  of  a  set,  thus  earning  the  right  to  challenge  J. 
Spencer  Gordon  of  Washington,  the  holder  of  the  title.  The  tournament 
was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Potomac  Club  of  Cumberland,  Md.,  on 
August  22. 

In  the  semi-final  round  Rendall  defeated  M.  Colton,  who  put  up  a  hard 
fight  in  the  first  set.  while  Rendall  had  not  struck  his  gait.  In  the  next, 
however,  Rendall  played  fast  and  accurately,  not  giving  his  opponent  a 
chance.  S.  Jarvis  Adams.  Jr.,  won  the  other  semi-final,  defeating  H.  Boyd 
in   a   rather  "one-sided   affair.  _  -r.       ■,,,■,   r         j    *  j 

The  final  round  was  somewhat  of  a  surprise,  as  Rendall  defeated  Adams 
in  three  straight  sets.  Adams  was  thought  by  some  to  have  a  good  chance 
against  the  Philadelphian,  and  by  most  to  at  least  make  the  match  more 
intcrcstiiiET. 

The  challenge  round  proved  to  be  the  best  match  of  the  tournament.  It 
lasted  four  sets.  J.  Spencer  Gordon  having  taken  the  second  one.  The 
other^  went  to  the  Rev.  H.  J.  Rendall.  The  tennis  was  fast  and.  from  a 
spectator's   point   of   view,   decidedly   interesting.     The   summaries:

Knickerbocker  Field  Club  Open  Tournament. 

The  honors  of  the  annual  tournament  of  the  Knickerbocker  Field  Club 
fell  to  the  hands  of  H.  S.  Roberts.  There  were  several  surprises  in  the 
singles  event,  the  most  notable  of  them  being  the  defeat  of  W.  B. 
Cragin,  Jr.,  by  W.  N.  Jennings,  Jr.,  6/4,  8/6.  Jennings  played  well,  hit- 
ting hard  and  placing  to  advantage  throughout  the  match,  while  Cragin 
was  more  or  less  erratic.  He  did  not  appear  to  get  started  and  his  play 
was   far  from  the   standard  of  his  usual   safe,   steady   game. 

In  the  semi-finals  Roberts  met  Dunham,  whom  he  defeated  in  a  three-set 
match  of  pretty  tennis.  In  this  round  Baggs  defeated  R.  H.  Boggs  after 
having  lost  the  first  set,   10/8.     He  took  the  nexi  two,  however,  6/3.  6/1.

Roberts  defeated  Baggs  in  the  final  round,  in  a  rather  peculiar  match. 
He  took  the  first  set  at  6/0.  Baggs  made  more  of  an  effort  in  the  second 
set,  winning  it  at  7/5.  In  the  third  set  Baggs  continued  to  play  well,  but 
Roberts  proved  too  strong  for  him  at  the  finish  and  won  at  8/6.  In  the 
fourth  set  Baggs  made  little  or  no  effort,  Roberts  winning  at  6/0.  The 
final   score  was,   6/0,  5/7,  8, '6,  6/0.

round  he  met  and  defeated  Carlton  R.  Gardner  in  a  five-set  match. 
Gardner  started  well,  winning  the  first  set,  6/4.  He  fell  oft',  however,  in 
the  second,  while  Pell  seemed  to  improve  considerably.  The  heat  was- 
intense,  and  Gardner  was  forced  to  play  back,  losing  the  set  at  love.  In 
the  third  set  both  men  played  well,  Gardner  winning  at  8/6.  Pell  took 
the   next   two.    however,   rather   easily   at   0/2,   6/3. 

A  surprise  came  in  the  second  round,  witii  the  defeat  of  G.  F.  Touchard 
at  the  hands  of  W.  C.  Grant.  Touchard  started  brilliantly,  taking  the 
first  set  at  6/2.  In  the  second  he  had  a  lead  of  4/1,  when  he  slacked  up 
his  pace,  and  could  not  regain  it,  thus  losing  at  6/4.  Grant  took  the 
third   set,   6/3. 

Pell  defeated  Inman  in  the  semi-final  round,  6/4,  6/2.  Inman  was 
more  or  less  erratic  towards  the  end,  while  Pell  steadily  improved  as  the 
match  progressed.  Gardner  won  from  Grant  in  this  round,  defeating  him 
by  a  score  of  6/4,  6/4.  He  started  in  carelessly,  giving  Grant  a  lead  of 
3/0,  but  improved  wonderfully  and  took  five  straight  games.  Grant  took 
the  next  game  but  lost  the   following  one,  giving  Gardner  the   set  at   6/4. 

Hackett  and  Alexander  won  the  doubles  event,  defeating  William  A. 
Larned  and  George  L.  Wrenn  in  the  final  round.  The  match  was  a  good 
one,  although  the  four  contestants  were  capable  of  better  tennis.  Ilackett 
and  Alexander  won  in  straight  sets,  but  the  play  was  close,  the  score 
being   9/7,   7/5,    11/9. 

In  the  semi-final  round  Larned  and  Wrenn  defeated  Kendall  and  Lind- 
ley  by  default,  after  having  won  the  first  set,  6/2.  The  match  was  stopped 
on  account  of  rain,  and  as  the  final  was  to  be  played  on  the  following 
day,  the  latter  team  did  not  think  it  worth  while  to  continue.  Touchard 
and  Gardner  defaulted  to  Hackett  and  Alexander  in  this  round,  in  order 
not  to  crowd  too  many  matches  into  the  final  day,  two  days  of  play  having 
been  lost  by  rain.     The  summaries:

Mount  Washington   Open  Tournament. 

The  annual  tournament  of  the  Mount  Washington  Club  was  started  on 
July  23.  There  was  an  entry  list  of  sixty-five  players  in  the  singles  event, 
being  a  record  for  the   State  of  Maryland. 

Clarence  Fisher  won  the  singles  by  defeating  Harvey  in  a  hard  four-set 
match.  Harvey  fought  his  way.  most  of  the  time,  but  was  unable  to  win 
at  critical  points  against  the  Maryland  State  champion.  The  score  wa# 
10/8,    7/5,   3/6,   6/3. 

In  the  semi-final  round  Fisher  had  an  easy  time  with  Chipman,  defeating^ 
him  6/3,   6/1.  Harvey  defeated   Magruder,  6/2,   7/5. 

In  the  doubles  event  Kerr  and  Brooke  defeated  Whitehurst  and  Brown, 
6/3,  7/5,  in  the  semi-final  round,  while  McLean  and  Magruder  defeated 
Lowndes  and    Davis.    7/5,   6/2. 

The  final  round  was  a  very  good  one,  the  tennis  being  at  times  brilliant. 
McLean  and  Magruder  proved  the  strongest  team,  however,  defeating  Kerr 
and  Brooke  in  a  four-set  match.  Kerr  was  very  erratic  at  times  and  his 
partner  had  hard  work  to  steady  him  down.  The  score  was  6/3,  1/6, 
6/4,    12/10. 

This  is  probably  the  most  important  local  tournament  of  Baltimore,  every 
prominent  player  of  the  city  having  entered  with  the  exception  of  the 
Colston  brothers,  Fred  C.  and  Campbell,  and  Basil  Wagner.  The

District  of  Columbia  Championship. 

The  Bachelors'  Lawn  Tennis  Club's  annual  fixture  for  the  District  of 
Columbia  championships  was  played  early  in  October  and,  as  usual, 
attracted    quite   a    large   entry. 

The  title  changed  hands,  however,  and  for  the  first  time  in  many  years 
departed  from  the  strong  grasp  of  the  Doyle  family.  A.  W.  Howard,  a 
rising  player,  but  handicapped  by  the  loss  of  an  arm,  came  through  the 
tournament  and  wrested  the  title  from  L.  I.  Doyle,  the  third  of  that 
family  of  tennis  experts.  Neither  C.  B.  nor  H.  E.  Doyle  entered  the 
singles,  but,  playing  together  in  doubles,  they  had  little  trouble  in  retain- 
ing the  title  they  have  held  so  long.

New  Rochelle  Open  Tournament. 

The  New  Rochelle  Lawn  Tennis  Club  held  its  first  tournament  on  its 
new  court  on  September  2.  There  were  seventy-three  competing  in  the 
singles  and  thirty-two  in  the  doubles.  B.  M.  Phillips  won  the  singles 
event,  defeating  Abraham  Bassford  in  the  final  round.  Bassford  had 
played  three  matches  earlier  in  the  day  and  was  rather  tired  when  he  met 
Phillips.  Tliis  may  account  for  the  rather  easy  victory  of  the  latter,  by

Club  on  August  15  and  following  days,  by  defeating  E.  T.  Newman  in  a 
five-set  match  in  the  final  round.  Newman  won  the  first  set  rather  easily 
and  also  took  the  second,  but  had  a  hard  struggle  for  it.  The  next  set 
w-ent  to  6/2  in  favor  of  Newsman,  and  it  looked  at  this  point  as  if  he 
were  bound  to  win.  Armstrong,  however,  pulled  the  set  out  by  the  score 
of  7/5.  Newman  was  pretty  w^ell  tired  out  after  this,  and  Armstrongs

In  the  semi-final  round  Armstrong  lost  the  first  set  to  T.  G.  Lyte,  but

and  Conrad  Young,  both  of  whom  figured  prominently  in  the  first  annual 
championship. 

The  right  to  challenge  Cuthbert  Potter,  the  champion  of  1909,  was 
contested  in  the  finals  between  Harry  Koch  and  Arthur  Scribner,  the 
latter  winning  in  straight  sets,  6/2,  6/4,  6/4.  Potter  and  Scribner  waged 
a  long,  hard-fought  battle  for  the  championship  before  aii  enthusiastic 
gallery,  which  numbered  over  500.  Until  the  linal  set.  Potter  had  a  slight 
advantage  over  his  opponent,  but  his  perhaps  too  aggresive  tactics  taxed 
his  strength  and   the  last  set  was  won  by   Scribner,    6/3.     The  summaries:

by  defeating  Samuel  A.  Westfall,  winner  of  the  tournament,  in  the  chal-

the   courts    of   the   Kings   County   Tennis   Club,    Brooklyn,    N.    Y. 

In  the  third  round  Harry  C.  Martin  defeated  Henry  Mollenhauer  in 
straight  sets,  6/3,  6/4.  This  was  a  pretty  match  to  watch,  both  men  hit- 
ting hard  and  placing  well.  W.  M.  Hall  had  little  trouble  in  defeating 
C.  G.  Plimpton,  6/2,  6/1.  Westfall  lost  a  set  to  Joseph  T.  McMahon,

\'oshell  took  the  first  set  from  Westfall  in  this  round,  at  6/2.  He  played 
well,  but  was  unable  to  keep  up  his  "good  streak,"  and  Westfall  won  the 
next  two  sets.  6/3,   6/2. 

In  the  final  round  Westfall  had  a  hard  match  with  Martin,  winning  in 
four  sets,  the  last  two  going  to  deuce.  Martin  was  expected  to  win,  but 
Westfall  was  much  the  steadier  of  the  two,  and  pulled  out  at  critical 
moments.  The  match  was  close  and  might  have  been  anybody's  until  the 
end.     The  score   was  6/2,   4/6,  8/6,  9/7. 

Westfall  started  out  well  in  the  challenge  round,  winning  the  first  set, 
6/2,  but  Cragin  settled  down  to  work  and  won  the  next,  6/4.  The  next 
set  went  to  Cragin,  10/8,  after  a  hard  fight.  Westfall  went  to  pieces  in

Annual  Chevy  Chase  Tournament. 

The  annual  invitation  spring,  tournament  of  the  Chevy  Chase  Club  of 
Washington,  D.  C,  attracted  several  well-known  Eastern  players,  among 
whom  were  W.  F.  Johnson,  G.  F.  Touchard,  L.  E.  Mahan  and  H.  E. 
Doyle.  As  was  expected,  Touchard  and  Johnson  had  little  trouble  in 
coming  through,  but  the  result  of  their  meeting  furnished  a  decided  sur- 
prise. Touchard  played  unusually  well  for  so  early  in  the  season,  while 
Johnson  showed  plainly  the  need  of  practise.  The  New  Yorker  won  the 
first  set  after  a  hard  struggle,  but  Johnson  won  the  second  very  easily. 
The  third  saw  Johnson  badly  outclassed  and  the  fourth  was  not  much 
better.  Touchard,  throughout  the  match,  came  into  the  net  and,  try  as  he 
would,  Johnson  could  not  pass  him.  The  latter's  attempt  to  assume  his 
opponent's  methods  in  the  last  set  proved  disastrous  in  the  extreme,  for 
Touchard  passed  him  consistently  and  had  all  the  better  of  the  rallies. 
The  challenge  round  was  a  more  even  contest  than  the  final  had  been,  but 
C.  B.  Doyle,  the  defender,  had  one  fault  which  proved  a  vulnerable  spot 
for  Touchard's  drives.  The  former  had  but  poor  control  of  his  backhand, 
and  beyond  a  high  floating  chop  and  rather  short  lob  could  make  no  stroke 
from  that  side  of  his  court.     The  score  was  6/4,  6/3,  4/6,  6/3. 

L.  E.  Mahan  and  W.  F.  Johnson  proved  an  excellent  doubles  combina- 
tion, and  in  the  final  round  made  short  work  of  Touchard  and  W.  H.  Con- 
nell.  The  latter  did  the  bulk  of  the  work  for  his  team,  but  Mahan's 
severe  smashes  and  sound  volleying  kept  the  losing  pair  constantly  on 
the   defensive. 

Much  to  the  surprise  of  every  one  that  tried  and  well-matched  pair,  the 
Doyle  brothers,  went  down  to  Mahan  and  Johnson  in  the  challenge  round 


SPALDING'S     LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  165 

in  straight  sets.  They  suffered  from  an  off  day  on  their  net  play,  and  as 
they  were  no  match  for  their  opponents  in  other  respects  the  result  was 
inevitable. 


West  Side  Championship. 


■  By  his  wonderful  steadiness  and  untiring  persistency,  Ross  Burchard 
defeated  Fred  C.  Inman  in  the  final  round  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club 
championship,  held  on  May  14.  Inman  was  very  erratic  and  for  this 
reason    was   unable   to   do   anything^  with   his   steady   opponent. 

r.i  the  semi-tinal  round  Burchard  lost  a  set  to  Cushman,  but  rallied  in 
the  second  and  won  the  match,  4/6,  7/5,  6/3.  Inman  defeated  John 
Tomlinson,  Jr.,  6/z,  9/7-  The  latter  put  up  a  hard  tight  in  the  second  set, 
but   was  unable  to  win.

166  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

The  Bedford  Park  Event. 

With  the  exception  of  C.  R.  Gardner  the  entry  for  the  annual  spring 
tournament  of  the  Bedford  Park  Club  was  practically  the  same  as  that  of  a 
year  ago. 

The  final  round  provided  a  great  five-set  affair  between  Gardner  and  Pell. 
It  was  fast,  clean  tennis  from  beginning  to  end,  and  there  was  but  little  to 
choose  between  winner  and  loser.  The  last  was  the  best  set  of  all. 
Neither  man  could  gain  much  advantage  until,  at  5-all,  Pell  slipped  and 
fell  heavily.  From  then  on  the  Californian  had  matters  all  in  his  favor, 
for  Pell  seemed  unable  to  recover  from  the  shaking  up  he  had  received. 
The  challenge  round  was  not  played  until  early  in  October,  and  again  it 
was  a  fight  from  start  to  finish.  Gardner  won  the  first  two  sets,  but  in  each 
Touchard,  the  holder,  had  at  one  time  a  commanding  lead.  The  third  and 
fourth  were  one-sided,  and  in  the  fifth  Touchard  ran  up  to  5/1  and  40/15. 
At  that  point  Gardner  began  to  creep  up,  and  with  the  aid  of  a  lucky  drive 
or  two  ran  out  six  straight  games. 

The  doubles  did  not  attract  as  many  good  teams  as  might  have  been 
expected,  but  the  final  between  Gardner  and  W.  II.  Connell  and  W.  B. 
Cragin,  Jr.,  and  W.  M.  Hall  was  well  worth  watching.  On  one  side 
steady  plugging  combined  with  excellent  team  work  opposed  brilliancy  on 
the  other  and  the  result  was  in  favor  of  the  former.  Connell  played 
splendidly,  but  Gardner  did  not  approach  even  average  form,  and  Cragin 
and  Hall  were  never  in  danger.     They  won  in  four  sets.     The  summaries:

Southampton    Tournament. 

It  was  California's  week  at  Southampton,  when,  on  August  8,  the  Meadow 
Club  began  its  annual  invitation  tournament.  Hendrick  and  lUmdy.  the 
national  champions'  challengers,  and  Maurice  McLoughlin  competed,  and  in 
each  event  representatives  of  the  Pacific  Coast  took  their  part  in  the  final 
matches.  Beside  the  Westerners  the  East  was,  as  usual,  strongly  repre- 
sented, among  those  competing  being  N.  W.  IJiles,  F.  C.  Colston,  W.  F. 
Johnson  and  C.  R.  Gardner.  Upsets  were  quite  numerous,  and  in  the  first 
round  a  notable  one  occurred  when  J.  D.  E.  Jones,  the  veteran  Rhode 
Island  champion,  played  cleverly  against  W.  F.  Johnson,  winning  in  a 
three-set  match.  A  little  later  veteran  E.  P.  Fischer  went  down  before 
W.  P.  Blagden  in  a  one-sided  affair,  and  R.  A.  Holden,  Jr.,  came  within 
a  point  of  ending  the  aspirations  of  Gardner.  In  the  following  round 
another  remarkable  form  reversal  took  place  when  the  youngster,  Dean 
Mathey,  completely  outclassed  his  famous  rival,  R.  H.  Palmer,  winning  in 
straight  sets,  allowing  Palmer  but  two  games  in  the  first  set  and  one  in 
the  second.  IVIcLoughlin  earned  his  way  into  the  semi-final  bracket  in  a 
match  which  was  admittedly  the  best  of  the  meeting.  His  opponent  was 
N.  W.  Niles.  and  the  latter,  though  defeated,  had  victory  within  his  grasp 
on  more  than  one  occasion.  In  the  first  set  McLoughlin  came  within  a 
point  of  winning  when  he  led  at  7/6  and  40/15,  but  a  series  of  perfect 
drives  from  the  Bostonian  evened  the  score  and  a  moment  later  the  latter 
took  the  set  at  9^7.  In  the  second  set  McLoughlin  controlled  the  situation 
from  beginning  to  end.  Niles  was  played  off  his  feet,  and  at  no  time  did 
he  have  a  chance.  Beginning  the  third  set  with  his  own  service,  the  ex-inter- 
collegiate champion  led  at  2/1,  when,  by  passing  McLoughlin  in  faultless 
style,  he  broke  through  the  latter's  delivery  on  the  fourth  game.  This, 
followed  by  his  own  service,  gave  him  the  lead  of  4/1.  The  handicap, 
however,  only  acted  as  a  stimulant  to  McLoughlin,  and  by  setting  a  pace 
which  it  was  a  physical  impossibility  for  Niles  to  compete  against,  he  ran 
out  five  straight  games.  Another  match  which  came  in  the  nature  of  a 
surprise  was  Colston's  defeat  of  Gardner  in  the  same  round.  The  Mary- 
lander's  hard-hitting  yet,  withal,  accurate  game  was  too  much  for  his  tall 
opponent  in  the  first  set,  the  latter  winning  but  two  games.     The  score  of 


1.  Herr  H.  Kleinschroth,  with  Frau  Neresheimer,  won  every  Open  Mixed  except 
at  Nice ;  2,  Herr  F.  W.  Rahe.  who,  at  the  Beau  Sete  and  Cannes  Club  Tourna- 
ments, beat  M.  Max  Decugis  in  the  Open  Singles. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  169 

the  second  set  was  just  reversed,  however,  due  to  Gardner's  excellent 
placing;  but  in  the  third,  successful  attempts  of  difficult  shots  and  remark- 
ably steady  play  enabled  Colston  to  lead  at  5/1.  Gardner  got  the  seventh 
game,  but  the  match  ended  when  Colston  took  the  eighth.  Another  good 
match  was  that  played  in  the  semi-tinal  round  between  McLoughlin  and 
Bundy.  As  is  always  the  case  when  these  two  meet,  Bundy's  peculiar  service 
was  too  much  for  McLoughlin,  and,  getting  under  it  with  remarkable  quick- 
ness, he  practically  volleyed  his  way  through  the  opening  set,  winning  at 
6/3.  In  the  second  and  third  McLoughlin  seemed  better  able  to  handle 
his  opponent's  service,  and  by  hard,  sure  driving  and  faultless  net  play  the 
second  set  went  to  him  by  a  score  of  6/4.  Largely  due  to  Bundy's  errors 
in  the  deciding  set,  and  altogether  different  play,  McLoughlin  won  at  6/2. 
In  the  other  bracket  Mathey,  after  getting  in  each  set  to  5/3,  was  over- 
hauled by  Colston,  the  latter  winning  at  8/6,  7/5.  Unfortunately  for 
Colston,  when  he  faced  McLoughlin  in  the  final,  he  ran  into  one  of  the 
latter's  phenomenally  brilliant  streaks.  Playing  with  terrific  speed  and  no 
less  certainty,  McLoughlin  gave  his  opponent  not  the  slightest  chance,  and 
the  best  the  latter  could  do  was  to  get  two  games  in  the  first  set,  one  in 
the  second  and  two  in  the  third.  This  meager  score  was  in  no  way  due  to 
weak  play  of  his,  for  nothing  was  too  difficult  for  McLoughlin  to  accom- 
plish, and.  in  combination  with  his  really  remarkable  speed,  his  steadiness 
was  bewildering. 

The  first  match  of  importance  in  doubles  was  that  between  Niles  and 
Dabney  and  Finck  and  Watson,  and,  to  the  surprise  of  all,  the  latter  accom- 
plished the  Eastern  champion's  downfall  in  straight  sets,  6/3,  6/4.  This 
was  in  no  small  measure  due  to  an  erratic  streak  of  Dabney's,  for  time  and 
again  he  fell  down  miserably  on  the  simplest  shots.  McLoughlin  paired 
up  with  Champion  Larned  in  this  event,  and  at  no  time  were  they  very 
hard  pressed  on  their  way  to  the  finals.  In  the  semi-final  round  they  faced 
Palmer  and  Johnson,  and  the  match  proved  little  more  than  a  work-out  for 
the  new  combination.  Bundy  and  Hendrick  had  almost  as  easy  a  time 
coming  through  the  opposite  side,  winning  from  Lyon  and  Colston  in  the 
semi-final  round  in  straight  sets.  A  great  five-set  match  was  then  played 
between  Larned  and  McLoughlin  and  Bundy  and  Hendrick.  A  more  even 
battle  could  not  have  been  desired,  and,  with  the  exception  of  an  erratic 
streak  by  Larned  once  or  twice,  the  tennis  playe<l  by  all  four  was  excellent. 
It  was  a  case  of  service  throughout  the  first  set,  but,  in  the  twelfth  game, 
Hendrick's  service  was  won  by  the  champion  and  his  young  partner,  and  a 
moment  later  the  first  set  went  to  the  latter.  In  the  second,  the  order  of 
things  was  just  reversed.  At  4-all  McLoughlin's  service  was  won  by 
Hendrick  and  Bundy,  and  with  Bundy's  next  the  challengers  from  the 
Coast  had  little  difficulty  in  evening  the  score.  The  third  and  fourth  were 
both  close,  Larned  and  McLoughlin  winning  the  third  and  their  opponents 
the  fourth.  In  the  fifth  at  4-all  on  Larned's  service,  the  champion  fell  down 
badly  on  three  easy  lobs,  and  it  looked  for  a  moment  as  though  the  match 
was  about  ended.  In  fact,  had  not  Bundy  hesitated  long  enough  to  allow  a 
ball  that  was  going  out  to  strike  his  racket,  the  result  might  have  been 
different.  As  it  wa?,  Larned  and  McLoughlin  finally  pulled  out  the  game, 
and  Bundy's  delivery  was  then  won  by  them  for  the  match. 


Bronxville  Tournament. 

G.  F.  Touchard  won  the  Bronxville  championship,  which  he  lost  in  1909 
to  G.  M.  Church.  Both  he  and  Pell  had  little  trouble  in  reaching  the 
final  round.  There  was  a  large  entry  list,  but  Touchard  and  Pell  were 
the   only   first-class   players   in   it. 

In  the  first  round  there  were  three  closely  contested  matches.  B.  Ilam- 
mett  defeated  O'Brien,  7/9,  12/10,  6/3;  William  Connell  defeated  L.  H. 
Roper,  4/6,  6/3.  8/6,  and  Latimar  won  from  Sears,  6/3,  4/6,  7/5. 


170  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

In  the  semi-finals  Touchard  won  from  Johnston  at  6/4,  2)/^^  6/4.  He 
played  carelessly  and  Johnson,  who  was  playing  hard,  might  have  won  if 
Touchard  had  not  been  able  to  get  back  to  his  game  at  the  end  of  the 
match.  Pell  won  from  Clark  at  6/2,  7/5.  He  played  well  and,  although 
Clark  tried  hard  in  the  second  set,  there  was  never  any  doubt  as  to  the 
outcome. 

The  final  round  was  played  on  a  very  hot  day.  Neither  Touchard  nor 
Pell  seemed  able  to  exert  themselves.  After  a  long,  hard  fight,  Touchard 
won   by  the  score   of   .3/6,   6,  2,   2/6,   6/0,   7/5. 

The  day  of  the  challenge  round  was  also  extremely  hot,  but  Touchard 
completely  outclassed  his  opponent.  Church,  and  won  by  the  score  of  6/1, 
6/2,  7/5.  After  the  second  set  a  rest  was  taken  and  Church  played  con- 
siderably better  in  the  third.  Touchard,  however,  proved  too  strong  for 
him  and   thus   regained   the   Bronxville    title. 

Church  and  Pell  came  through  tc  the  final  round  in  the  doubles  event 
with  little  difficulty,  meeting  Rosenbaum  and  Phillips  in  the  final.  The 
closest  matches  in  this  event  were  when  Rosenbaum  and  Phillips  defeated 
Voshell  and  Baggs,  9/7,  4/6,  7/5,  and  Clark  and  Sands  won  from  Leo  and 
Tomlinson,    10/8,    11/13,    7/5. 

In  the  semi-final  round  Church  and  Pell  defeated  Tobey  and  Pyatt  by 
default  and  Phillips  and  Rosenbaum  defeated  Clark  and  Sands,   7/5,  6/3. 

Pell  and  Church  had  not  much  difficulty  in  disposing  of  Phillips  and 
Rosenbaum   in    the   final   round.      The   score    was   6/4,   6/3,   6/4. 

Miss  Marie  Wagner  won  the  ladies'  singles  easily,  coming  through  with- 
out losing  a  set.  In  the  fnial  round  she  won  from  Miss  C.  Cassell, 
6/2,  6/1.

New  York  Tennis  Club  Tournament. 

V/ith  a  poorer  field  in  point  of  class  than  it  had  ever  drawm,  the  New 
York  Lawn  Tennis  Club  held  its  annual  June  tournament  for  the  beautiful 


172  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Felipe  Cup  and  Manhattan  Bowls  emblematic  of  the  doubles  championship 
of  the  city. 

The  singles  entry,  besides  being  a  smaller  one  than  ever  before,  failed 
to  include  a  player  of  the  class  of  Pell,  LeRoy,  Hackett  and  others  who 
had  heretofore  taken  part,  and  it  was  not  surprising  that  Wylie  C.  Grant 
should  be  the  one  to  challenge  for  the  trophy  presented  by  Jose  Chaves.  He 
faced  F.  C.  Inman  in  the  final  round  and  to  the  surprise  of  everyone  won 
in  straight  sets.  Inman,  however,  failed  to  do  himself  justice  and  was 
hopelessly  wild  and  unsteady.  His  occasional  flashes  of  form  were  too 
infrequent  to  aid  him  to  any  extent,  and  Grant  simply  played  to  return 
everything   and   allow   his   opponent   to    increase    his   total   of   errors. 

The  challenge  round  was  not  productive  of  startling  or  even  fair  tennis, 
but  at  that  Grant  was  at  no  time  dangerous  to  the  holder,  G.  F.  Touchard. 
The  latter  won  the  first  two  sets  and  let  down  in  the  third,  but  the  fourth 
was    his    from   beginning   to   end. 

Needless  to  say  no  one  in  the  doubles  afforded  more  than  fair  practise 
for  the  national  champions,  who  played  through  for  a  second  leg  on  the 
valuable  Manhattan  Bowls.  In  the  final  they  faced  Grant  and  J.  C.  Parkes, 
but  althougli  Grant  played  exceptionally  well,  Parkes  was  quite  outclassed 
and  a  straight  set  victory  was  recorded  for  the  national  champions.  The 
summaries:

San  Francisco  Championship. 

The  championship  for  the  city  of  San  Francisco  was  won  by  Maurice 
E.  McLoughl.n  on  lune  18,  thus  g.vnig  him  the  title  for  the  fourth  co- 
secutive  time.  M.  H.  Long  won  the  tournament,  but  no  ^vithout  consul- 
erable  trouble,  against  P.  Hardman,  one  of  the  younger  players.  Hardman 
plays  a  biilliant  game  at  times,   but  he   is  apt  to  be  erratic. 

Long  won  his  match  in  the  sem-final  round  through  the  default  of  R. 
Greenberg.  A.  Rosenberg  defeated  F.  Bass,  7/5,  6/3,  easily  keeping  the 
lead    from   the    start   to    the   finish.  ,  .      ,. 

The  final  round,  between  Rosenberg  (one  of  the  leading  players  some 
years  ago)  and  Long,  was  well  worth  while  to  the  spectators.  Rosenberg 
played  cleverly,  making  Long  work  for  every  point,  but  he  lacked  the 
endurance   of   his  younger    opponent.  jr^jT       „•« 

In  the  challenge  round  McLoughlin,  the  title  holder,  defeated  Long  n 
straight  sets.  There  was  a  strong  wind  during  the  match,  which  evidently 
affected    the    games    of    both   players.      Neither    of    them    were   quite   at   the

Harlem  Tournament. 

The  tournament  of  the  Harlem  Tennis  Club  was  started  on  May  4. 
William  B.  Cragin,  Jr.,  was  the  winner,  after  having  defeated  two  good 
men,  Theodore  Roosevelt  Pell  in  the  third  round,  and  Walter  M.  Hall  in 
the   final    round. 

Cragin's  match  with  Pell  was  a  very  peculiar  one.  It  started  with 
Cragin  winning  the  first  set  at  6/0.  In  the  second  set  Pell  plaved  better, 
winning  at  8/0.  In  the  last  set,  however,  Pell,  who  is  very  nervous  and 
excitable,  went  to  pieces,  and  Cragin  won  the  set  and  match.  The  score 
was  6/0. 

In  the  final  match  there  was  some  very  good  tennis,  but  both  players 
were  more  or  less  erratic.  Hall  fell  a  victim  to  Cragin's  steadiness,  the 
latter   winning   by   the   score   of   8/6,   6/3,    1/6,   0/6,    6/2. 

In  the  doubles,  Hall  and  Cragin  met  Steinacher  and  Richey  in  the  final 
round.  The  former  team  had  little  trouble  in  the  first  two  sets,  winning 
at  6/1,  6/3.  In  the  third  set,  however,  Richey  and  Steinacher  had  a 
streak  and  won  the  set,  6/3.  Hall  and  Cragin  won  the  fourth,  after  a 
hard  struggle,  7/5. 

In  the  semi-finals  Cragin  and  Hall  defeated  G.  Steinacher  and  Vc  hell, 
6/0,  6/3,  and  Richey  and  J.  Steinacher  defeated  Lowers  and  Noble  ';/7, 
6/1,  6/3. 

R.  L.  Baggs  won  the  consolation,  defeating  S.  Hartman  in  tb  final 
round,  3/6,  6/4,  6/3. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  177 


Riviera  Tournaments 

On  February  13,  191 1,  the  tennis  season  on  the  French  and  Italian 
Rivieras  opened  in  earnest.  San  Remo  was  the  place  where  the  first 
tournament  was  held  and  among  the  many  cracks  participating  were  A.  F. 
Wilding,  F.  C.  Inman  and  Rahe.  Inman,  in  form  far  from  his  best,  lost 
to  the  young  German  in  the  first  round  and  the  latter  went  down  before 
Wilding  in   the   final,   after   a    splendid   five-set    match. 

Mentone,  coming  at  the  same  time,  was  the  first  of  a  series  in  which 
Wilding  and  Max  Decugis  faced  each  other,  and  the  latter  proved  to  be 
in  excellent  form,  allowing  Rahe  but  a  single  game  in  their  semi-final 
match  and  forcing  Wilding  to  the  limit  in  the  finals.  The  fifth  set  was 
even  at  four-all,  but  the  New  Zealander  cut  loose  and,  driving  with  great 
power   and    accuracy,    ran    out    the    following   two    games. 

Practically  a  repetition  of  the  Mentone  tournament,  the  famous  Monte 
Carlo  meeting  ended  in  a  wonderfully  fast  five-set  affair  between  Wilding 
and  Decugis.  On  this  occasion  Decugis  got  away  well,  winning  the  first 
two  sets  easily.  The  third  set  required  fourteen  games  before  Wilding 
won  it,  but  it  meant  the  beginning  of  the  end  for  Decugis,  Wilding 
improving  by  leaps  and  bounds,   winning  linally,   5/7,    1/6,  8/6,   6/0,  6/1. 

Wilding  and  M.  J.  G.  Ritchie  won  the  doubles  event,  disposing  of 
Decugis   and    Rahe   in    a   five-set   final   match. 

It  was  in  the  Cannes  tournament  that  Decugis,  for  the  first  time  failed 
to  reach  the  final  round.  He  was  beaten  by  Rahe,  1/6,  7/5  6/3.  Wilding, 
on  the  other  hand,  continued  to  hand  out  the  same  dose  to  one  and  all 
his  opponents,  but  found  it  hard  to  administer  it  to  Ritchie.  The  latter 
played  in  far  the  best  form  he  had  yet  shown,  and  was  beaten  by  the 
narrow  margin  of  6/8,  7/5,  6/2.  Wilding  maae  short  work  of  Rahe  in 
the   final,    winning  at   6/1,   6/4,    6/2. 

The  Americans,  F.  C.  Inman  and  R.  W.  Williams,  were  awarded  the 
doubles  first  prize.  They  quite  properly  were  upheld  in  their  protest  by 
the  French  governing  body,  against  the  default  registered  against  them 
in  favor  of  Wilding  and  Ritchie.  Wilding,  it  seems,  failed  to  appear  on 
schedule  time,  but  when  on  the  following  day  he  was  ready  for  action, 
his  opponents  refused  to  play.  The  referee's  decision  was  overruled,  how- 
ever,  and   Wilding   and   Ritchie   were   defaulted   instead. 

The  day  after  the  Monte  Carlo  tournament  came  to  a  close  the  Mentone 
meeting  was  in  full  swing.  Practically  the  same  entry  was  made  as  in 
the  previous  event,  Craig  Biddle  and  R.  M.  Williams,  both  Philadelphians, 
again  taking  part.  Wilding  dropped  a  set  to  Piddle,  whose  game  has  im- 
proved remarkably,  but  defeated  Williams  easily  and  Ritchie  at  6/4,  6/2 
in   the   semi-final.  ' 

Decugis  lost  a  set  to  Bergmann.  and,  to  the  disappointment  of  all,  was 
forced  to  accept  the  default  of  Rahe,  as  the  latter  insisted  on  scratching.

their  game."  After  the  second  set,  which  Powell  won  at  love,  it  looked  as

three"  games.  In  the  third  set  Bailey  had  Kistine  so  tired  that  he  could  do 
little  or  nothing  with  the  Oklahoma  champion's  strokes.  In  the  semi-final

defeated  John  O.  Ames  in  straight  sets,  6/4,  6/1.  It  must  be  said,  however,

tfi  take  a  good  deal  of  life  out  of  both  men,  but  particularly  B'itch.  Gross 
wa^  much  steadier  than  his  opponent  and  landed  the  match  at  6/4,  6/2,  6/4.

THE  1910  RANKING  COMMITTEE. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Annual  Meeting  of  the  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A. 

The  thirtieth  annual  meeting  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis 
Association  was  held  Friday  evening,  February  3,  191 1,  at  the  Waldorf 
Astoria,  New  York.  It  was  well  attended  by  the  various  club  representa- 
tives in  person,  and  few  organizations  unable  to  gain  personal 
representation   had   not  handed   in   their   proxies. 

Two  questions  of  unusual  interest  and  importance  came  up  for  dis- 
cussion. One,  the  removal  of  the  championship  from  Newport,  to 
Philadelphia  preferably,  was  voted  upon,  but  failed  to  gain  the  votes 
necessary  to  go  through,  and  Newport  will  again  be  the  scene  of  the 
American  championship.  The  promoters  of  the  suggested  change,  how- 
ever, made  a  stronger  stand  than  expected  and  were  elated  by  the  manner 
in  which  their  scheme  was  accepted,  expressing  confidence  in  the  ultimate 
success    of    their    project. 

The  second  question  decided  upon  was  a  change  in  the  manner  of 
electing  the  Executive  Committee.  It  had  been  contended  that  a  man 
serving  on  the  committee  for  the  period  of  one  year  was  unable  to  ac- 
complish much  that  a  longer  term  would  make  possible  and  it  was  there- 
fore determined  to  elect  the  committee  in  divisions,  one  to  serve  for  three 
years,  another  for  two,  and  a  third  for  one  year.  The  question,  voted 
upon,  was  carried  unanimously,  and  the  men  elected  were  W.  A.  Larned, 
L.  H.  Waidner  and  R.  D.  Little  for  three  years.  P.  E.  Presbrey,  W.  J. 
Clothier  and  E.  F.  Torrey,  Jr.,  for  two  years.  R.  llolterhoff,  Sumner 
Hardy  and  L.  D.   Scott,  for  one  year.     The  following  officers  were  elected: 

President,  Dr.  James  Dwight,  Longwood  Cricket  Club,  Boston;  Somer- 
set  Club,    Boston,    Mass. 

Vice-President,   Robert   D.  Wrenn,  24  Broad  Street,  New  York  City. 

Secretary,  A.  L.  Hoskins,  corner  of  Fifth  and  Walnut  Streets,  Phila- 
delphia.

years:  W.  J.  Clothier,  Philadelphia,  Pa.;  P.  E.  Presbrey,  Boston,  Mass.; 
E.  F.  Torrey,  Jr.,  Clinton,  N.  Y.  For  one  year:  Sumner  Hardy,  San 
Francisco,   Cal.;   R.   llolterhoff,  Cincinnati,   O.;    L.   D.    Scott,  Atlanta,   Ga.

National  Indoor  Championship 

T.  R.  Pell  again  demonstrated  his  ability  on  the  board  courts  when  he 
went  through  the  tournament  held  in  February,  191 1,  at  the  Seventh 
Regiment   Armory,   New  York,   for   the   National    Indoor   Championship. 

Practically  the  same  men  who  competed  for  the  indoor  title  annually 
took  part  in  this,  the  twelfth  event  of  its  kind,  and  there  were  no  new- 
contenders  who  spelled  danger  to  the  old  guard.  Pell,  always  wonderfully 
clever  at  this  branch  of  the  game,  played  better  than  ever  before.  He  had 
an  easy  draw  to  the  semi-final.  There  he  faced  G.  F.  Touchard,  the  1910 
holder,  and  beat  him  with  ease.  Touchard  was  outclassed  completely  and 
in  the  two  sets  won  but  a  single  game.  In  the  final  W.  B.  Cragin.  Jr.,  who 
had  come  through  W.  M.  Hall  and  other  good  men,  made  little  progress 
against  Pell.  The  latter  won  at  6/2,  6/3,  64.  It  was  Pell's  third  win  of 
the  indoor  championship,  and  it  gave  him  possession  of  the  challenge  trophy 
for  which  he  has  had  to  play  through  each  year. 

The  doubles  proved  easy  for  Pell  and  F.  B.  Alexander.  Their  only  hard 
match  was  against  Touchard  and  C.  R.  dardner.  They  won  that  in  straight 
sets,   but  it   was  close  from   start  to   finish.      The   summaries:

National  Women's  Indoor  Championship 

For  the  third  time  Miss  Marie  Wagner  annexed  the  title  of  Indoor 
Champion,  when  on  March  9  she  defeated  the  1910  holder,  Mrs.  F.  G. 
Schmitz,  in  the  final  round  in  a  close  and  exciting  three-set  match.  There 
were  twenty-five  entries  in  singles,  and  twelve  teams  in  doubles. 

Miss  Wagner  won  her  early  matches  easily,  but  in  the  semi-final  Miss 
E.  Marcus  came  within  a  single  stroke  of  defeating  her.  Mrs.  Schmitz, 
however,  outclassed  all  her  opponents.  The  final  was  hard  fought,  and 
only  a  sensational  pull-up  by  the  champion  in  the  third  set  saved  her 
from  defeat.  Mrs.  Schmitz  led  at  4/1  in  the  deciding  set,  but  by  the 
hardest  kind  of  driving  Miss  Wagner  ran  out  five  successive  games. 

Miss  E.  Bunce  and  Miss  R.  Fleming  won  the  doubles.  Their  opponents 
in  the  final  were  Mrs.    Schmitz  and   Miss   Marcus.     The   summaries:

are  connected  by  the  side  lines  1)  F  and  E  G.  Halfway  between  the 
side  lines,  and  parallel  with  thtm.  is  drawn  the  half  court  line  I  11, 
dividing  the  space  on  each  side  of  the  net  into  two  equal  parts,  the 
right  and  left  courts.  On  each  side  of  the  net,  at  a  distance  of  21 
fi^et  from  it,  and  parallel  with  it,  are  drawn  the  service  lines  K  L  and 
M  N. 

THE    BALLS. 

2.  The  Balls  shall  measure  not  less  than  2^2  inches,  nor  more  than 
2  9-16  inches  in  diameter  :  and  shall  weigh  not  less  than  1  15-lti 
ounces,  nor  more  than  2  ounces. 

THE    GAME. 

3.  The  choice  of  sides,  and  the  right  to  serve  in  the  first  game, 
shall  be  decided  by  toss  ;  provided  that,  if  the  winner  of  the  toss 
choose  the  right  to  serve,  the  other  player  shall  have  choice  of  sides, 
and  vice  versa,  or  the  winner  of  the  toss  may  insist  upon  a  choice  by 
his  opponent.  If  one  player  choose  the  court,  the  other  may  elect 
not  to^serve. 

4.  The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net ;  the  player 
who  first  delivers  the  ball  shall  be  called  the  server,  and  the  other  the 
striker-out. 

5.  At  the  end  of  the  first  game  the  striker-out  shall  become  server. 
and  the  server  shall  become  striker-out ;  and  so  on  alternately  in  all 
the  subsequent  games  of  the  set  and  following  sets. 

6.  The  server  shall  serve  with  both  feet  behind,  i.  e..  further  from 
the  net  than  the  base  line  and  within  the  limits  of  the  imaginanj 
continuation  of  the  centre  service  and  the  side  lines.  It  is  not  a 
fault  if  one  only  of  the  server's  feet  rfo  not  touch  the  ground  at  the 
moment  at  which  the  service  is  delivered.  He  shall  place  both  feet 
upon  the  ground  immediately  before  serving  and  shall  not  take  a  run- 
ning nor  a  walking  start.  He  shall  deliver  the  service  from  the  right 
and  left  courts  alternately,  beginning  from  the  right,  in  each  of  his 
service  games,  even  though  odds  be  given  or  owed.

service  line,  or  out  of  court,  or  in  the  wrong  court  ;  or  if  the  sei'ver 
do  not  stand  as  directed  by  law  G.  If  the  server,  in  attempting  to 
serve,  miss  the  ball  altogether,  it  does  not  count  a  fault,  but  if  the 
ball  be  touched,  no  matter  how  slightly,  by  the  racket,  a  service  is 
thereby  delivered,  and  the  laws  governing  the  sei-vice  at  once  apply. 

9.  A  fault  cannot  be  taken. 

10.  After  a  fault  the  server  shall  serve  again  from  the  same  court 
from  which  he  served  that  fault,  unless  it  was  a  fault  because  he 
served  from  the  wrong  court. 

11.  A  fault  cannot  be  claimed  after 'the  next  service  is  delivered. 

12.  The  server  shall  not  serve  until  the  striker-nut  is  ready.  If 
the  latter  attempt  to  return  the  service,  he  shall  be  deemed  ready. 

13.  A  service  or  fault  delivered  when  the  striker-out  is  not  ready 
counts  for  nothing. 

14.  TTie  sem'ice  shall  not  be  volleyed,  that  is.  taken,  before  it  has 
touched  the  ground. 

15.  A  ball  is  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  except  as  pro- 
vided for  in  law  8.  and  remains  in  play  till  the  stroke  is  decided. 

16.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net  ;  but  a 
service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall  count  for  nothing. 

17.  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the  senice, 
or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play,  or  if  he  return 
the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  oppo- 
nent's court ;  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  provided  by  law  20. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two  consecu-

that  he  wears'or  carries,  except  his  racket  in  the  act  of  striking;  or 
if  he  touch  the  ball  with  his  racket  more  than  once  ;  or  if  he  touch 
the  net  or  any  of  its  supports  while  the  ball  is  in  play  ;  or  if  he  volley 
the  ball  before  it  has  passed  the  net. 

21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident,  not  within  his 
control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  "let."  But  when  a  permanent 
fixture  of  the  court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident,  the  point  shall  be- 
counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed  around  the  court  shall  be 
considered  permanent  fixtures.  If.  however,  a  ball  in  play  strike  a 
permanent  fixture  of  the  court  (other  than  the  net  or  posts)  before 
it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost ;  if  after  it  has  touched  the 
ground,  the  point  shall  be  counted.

If  both  players  have  won  three  strokes,  the  score  is  called  deuce;  and 
the  next  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  ndmntape  for  that 
player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the  game  : 
if  he  lose  the  next  stroke  the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until 
one  player  wins  the  two  strokes  immediately  following  the  score  of 
deuce,  when  game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set;  except  as 
below:  If  botli  players  win  five  games  the  scorf»  is  called  games  all  r 
ard  the  next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  game  for

that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  game,  he  wins  the  set  ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the  score  returns  to  games  all  ;  and  so  on, 
until  either  player  wins  the  two  games  immediately  following  the 
score  of  games  all.  when  he  wins  the  set.  But  the  committee  having 
charge  of  any  tournament  may  in  their  discretion  modify  this  rule 
by  the  omission  of  advantage   sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third 
and  every  subs'ecjuent  alternate  game  of  each  set  and  at  the  end  of

however,  be  open  to  the  players  by  mutual  consent  and  notification 
to  the  umpire  before  the  opening  of  the  second  game  of  the  match  to 
change  sides  instead  at  the  end  of  every  set  until  the  odd  and  con- 
cluding set,  in  which  they  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first, 
third  and  every  substMiuent  alternate  game  of  such  set. 

♦i'.").  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous  from  the  fii*st 
service  till  the  match  be  concluded;  provided,  however,  that  at  the 
end  of  the  third  set  either  player  is  entitled  to  a  rest,  which  shall 
not  exceed  seven  minutes,  and  provided,  further,  that  in  case  of  an 
unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the  c-ontrol  of  the  contestants,  a 
cessation  of  play  which  shall  not  exceed  two  minutes  may  be  allowed 
between  points  ;  but  this  proviso  shall  be  strictly  construed,  and  the 
privilege  never  granted  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  player  to  recover 
his  strength  or  wind.  The  referee  in  his  discretion  may  at  any  time 
postpone  the  match  on  account  of  darkness  or  condition  of  the  ground 
or  weather.  In  any  case  of  postponement,  the  previous  score  shall

player  who  at  the  cessation  thereof  was  in  the  court  first  chosen  shall 
have  the  choice  of  courts  on  the  recommencement  of  play.  He  shall 
stay  in  the  court  he  chooses  for  the  remainder  of  the  set.  The  last 
two  sentences  of  this  rule  do  not  apply  wnen  the  players  change  every 
alternate  game  as  provided  by  law  124. 

20.  If  a  player  serve  out  of  his  turn,  the  umpire,  as  soon  as  the 
mistake  is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  i)layer  to  serve  who  ought  to 
have  served.  Hut  all  strokes  scored  before  such  discovery  shall  be 
counted.  If  a  game  shall  have  been  completed  before  such  discovery, 
then  the  service  m  the  npxt  alternate  game  shall  be  delivered  by  the 
player  who  did  not  serve  out  of  his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 

2*7.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and  four- 
handed  games,  except  as  below  : 

THE  THREE-HANDED  AND  FOUR-HANDED  GAMES. 

28.  For  the  three-handed  and  four-handed  games  the  court  shall

side  lines,  as  shown  in  the  diagram. 

29.  In  the  three-handed  game,  the  single  player  shall  serve  in 
every  alternate  game. 

30.  In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have  the  right  to  serve 
in  the  first  game  shall  decide  which  partner  shall  do  so.  and  the  op- 
posing pair  shall  decide  in  like  manner  for  the  second  game.  The 
partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  first  game  shall  serve  in  the  third, 
and  the  partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  the  second  game  shall 
serve  in  the  fourth,  and  the  same  order  shall  be  maintained  in  all  the 
subsequent  games  of  the  set. 

.'n.     At    the   beginning  of   the  next  set,   either  partner  of  the  pair 

♦  AH  matches  in  which  women  take  part  in  tournaments  held  under  the 
auspices  of  the  United  States  National  Lawnn  Tenis  Association  shall  be  the  best

It  in  his  hand,  and  claims  the  stroke  because  the  ball  was  certainly 
going  out  of  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  It  makes  no  difference  where 
he  was  standing.  The  return  is  presumed  good  until  it  strikes 
the  ground  outside  of  the  court. 

II.  A  olayer  is  struck  by  the  ball  served  before  it  has  touched 
the  ground,  he  being  outside  of  the  service  court.     How  does  it  count? 

Decision. — The  player  struck  loses  the  stroke.  The  service  is 
presumably  good  until  it  strikes  in  the  wrong  court.  A  player 
cannot  take  the  decision  upon  himself  by  stopping  the  ball.  If 
it  is  going  to  be  a  fault,  he  has  only  to  get  out  of  the  way. 

III.  The  service  is  delivered  before  the  striker-out  is  ready.  He 
tries  to  return  it  and  fails.    Is  he  entitled  to  have  it  played  over  again? 

Decision. — No.     If   he   attempts    to   return   the    service   he    is 

deemed  ready. 

•  IV.     The   striker-out  calls   "not  ready,"   for  a   second  service.     The 

ball  strikes  beyond  the  service  line,  and  the  striker-out  claim.s  that  the 

fact  that  he  was  not  ready   makes  no  difference,   since   a   fault  cannot 

be  returned,  and,  therefore,  that  two  faults  have  been  served. 

Decision. — "^Tlie  second  service  goes  for  nothing.  A  player 
cannot  call  '"Not  ready."  and  then  have  the  service  count,  or 
not,  as  suits  his  interests. 

V.  A  ball  having  been  played  over  the  net  bounds  back  into  the 
court  from  which  it  came.  The  player  reaches  over  the  net  and  plays 
it  before  it  fall.     Has  he  a  right  to' do  so? 

Decision. — Yes,  provided  he  does  not  touch  the  net.  He  has 
a  right  to  play  the  ball  at  any  time  from  the  moment  it  crosses 
the  net  into  his  court  until  it  touches  the  ground  a  second  time. 

VI.  A  ball  is  played  into  the  net ;  the  player  on  the  other  side, 
thinking  that  the  ball  is  coming  over,  strikes  at  it  and  hits  the  net. 
Who  loses  the  stroke? 

Decision. — It  is  simply  a  question  of  fact  for  the  umpire  to 
decide.  If  the  player  touch  the  net  while  the  ball  was  still  in 
play  he  loses  the  stroke. 

VII.  Can  a  player  follow  a  ball  over  the  net  with  his  racket,  pro- 
vided that  he  hits  the  ball  on  his  own  side  of  the  net? 

Decision. — .Yes.  the  only  restrictions  are  that  he  shall  not 
volley  the  ball  until  it  has  crossed  the  net,  and  that  he  shall 
not  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports. 

VIII.  A  player's  racket  slips  out  of  his  hand  and  flies  into  the 
net.     Does  he  lose  the  stroke  for  hitting  the  net? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  the  ball  be  still  in  play.  It  does  not  mat- 
ter if  the  racket  be  in  a  player's  hand  or  not. 

IX.  A  player's  racket  leaves  his  hand,  but  meets  the  ball  and  re- 
turns it  oyer  the  net.     Is  it  a  good  return  ? 

Decision. — Yes.  There  is  no  law  requiring  a  racket  to  be  in 
a  player's  hand  when  the  ball  is  returned.  It  would  unques- 
tionably be  a  good  return  if  the  racket  were  held  against  the 
ground  by  a  player's  feet,  and  the  ball  bounded  back  off  of  it. 

X.  A  single  match  is  played  with  a  double  net  and  inside  posts.  A 
player   touches   the   net   beyond   the    inside  posts,  and   claims   that  he 


230  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

does  not    lose   the   stroke   because   there   should   be  no  net  more  than 

three  feet  outside  of  the  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  The  net  where  he  touches  it 
is  part  of  the  supports  of  the  net.  He  might,  perhaps,  have 
objected  to  the  arrangement  of  the  net  before  the  match. 

XI.  A  player  returns  the  ball,  and,  finding  that  he  cannot  stoj^ 
himself  before  reaching  the  net.  jumps  over  it.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Law  4  requires  that  "the  players  shall  stand  oa 
opposite  sides  of  the  net,"  and  therefore  the  player  invading 
his  opponent's  court  loses  the  stroke. 

XII.  A  ball  passes  outside  the  post  of  the  net  and  strikes  in  court. 
Is  it  a  good  return  ".■' 

Decision. — Yes. 

XIII.  A  ball  going  out  of  court  hits  the  top  of  the  posts  of  the 
net  and  bounds   into   the   opposite  court. 

Decision. — It  is  a  good  return. 

XIV.  The  service  or  the  ball  in  play  strikes  a  ball  lying  in  the 
court.     Can  it  l>e  returned"/ 

Decision. — Yes,  if  it  is  clear  to  the  umpire  that  the  right  ball 
is  returned. 

XV.  The  server  claims  that  the  striker-out  must  stand  in  the  court. 
Is  this  necessary".' 

Decision. — No.  The  striker-out  can  stand  wherever  he  pleases 
on  his  own  side  of  the  net. 

XVI.  A  bystander  gets  in  the  way  of  a  player  who  fails  to  retura 
the  ball.      May  he  then  claim  a  let'.' 

Decision. — Yes.  if.  in  the  umpire's  opinion,  he  was  prevented 
by  an  accident  beyond  his  control.  For  instance,  if  the  ropes 
or  the  seats  are  allowed  to  be  so  near  to  the  court  that  a  player 
is  interfered  with  by  them,  the  stroke  should  not  be  played 
again,  because  the  ropes  and  seats  form  part  of  the  arrange- 
ments of  the  ground.  If,  however,  a  spectator  passes  in  front 
of  those  seats,  or  places  a  chair  nearer  than  the  original  line, 
and  so  interferes  with  a  player,  the  stroke  should  be  played 
again. 

XVII.  A  player  is  interfered  with  as  above,  and  the  umpire  directs 
the  stroke  to  be  played  again.  The  server  had  previously  served  a. 
fault.     He  claims  the  right  to  two  services. 

Decision. — The  fault  stands.  A  let  does  not  annul  a  previous 
fault. 

XVIII.  A  return  hits  the  umpire,  or  his  chair  or  stand,  the  player 
claims  that  the  ball  was  going  into  court. 

Decision. — Stroke  is  lost. 

XIX.  A  player  receiving  fifteen  serves  from  the  left  court.  His 
opponent  claims  a  fault. 

Decision. — It  is  a  fault.  The  service  starts  from  the  right 
court  under  all   ciixumstances. 

XX.  At  fifteen-all  the  server  by  mistake  serves  from  the  left  court,, 
he  wins  the  stroke  and  serves  again  (a  fault),  the  mistake  is  then 
discovered.  Is  he  entitled  to  the  previous  fault?  From  which  court 
should  he  serve  next? 

Decision. — The  previous  stroke  stands.  A  fault  cannot  be 
claimed  after  the  next  service,  good  or  not,  is  delivered.  The 
next  service  should  be  from  the  left  court,  the  score  being- 
thirty-fifteen,  and  the  server  has  served  one  fault. 

XXI.  A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court,  he  loses  the  stroke, 
and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision. — If  the  stroke  was  played  in  his  first  service  it  is 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  231 

simply  a  fault,  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  tlie  wrong  court  he 
has  served  two  faults,  and  lost  the  stroke. 

XXII.  The  score  is  tive  games  all,  and  the  umpire  directs  the  play- 
ers to  play  an  advantage  set.  The  advantage  game  has  been  won, 
when  it  is  discovered  that  no  advantage  sets  are  to  be  played.  \\Tiat 
is  to  be  done? 

Decision. — Tlie  set  is  won  at  the  eleventh  game.  It  is  no 
part  of  the  umpire's  duty  to  decide  on  the  conditions  of  the 
matches. 

XXIII.  A  player  serves.  He  hears  the  umpire  call,  but  cannot 
hear  what  he  says.  He  knows  that  the  only  two  thing.s  that  the 
umpire  should  call  are  "fault"  and  "let,"  and  that  in  neither  case  can 
the  ball  be  in  play.  He,  therefore,  does  not  return  it,  only  to  hnd 
that   the   umpire  has   called   "play."     Has  he  any   redress'.'^ 

Dtciaion. — ^o. 

XXIV.  The  umpire  calls  "fault,"  and  then  instantly  changes  and 
says  "play."  The  strikcr-out  fails  to  return  the  ball,  and  he  claims 
he  was  prevented  by  the  umpire,  and  also  that  the  umpire  cannot 
change  his  decision. 

/>('<i.sjo/i.— TTie  umpire  should  call  a  let  and  the  service  be 
taken  again. 

XXV.  A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and  the  umpire 
calls  "play."  The  player  misunderstands  the  call  and  lets  the  ball 
fall.     He  then  claims  to  have   the   stroke  played  again. 

Decision. — The  stroke  stands. 
XXVI.     The   ball   strikes   the   ground  close   to   a   line  :   the   scorer 
scores  the  stroke  against  the  striker.     On  appeal   to  the  linesman,  the 
latter  decided  that  the  ball  was  not  out.     Which  decision  stands'.' 

Decision. — The  scorer  has  no  right  to  consider  a  ball  out 
until  the  linesman  has  called  to  that  effect,  therefore,  the  deci- 
sion of  the  latter  must  be  accepted.  The  decision  of  a  lines- 
man affecting  his  own  line  is  final. 

XXVII.  A  return  strikes  the  cord  running  along  the  bottom  of  the 
net  and  bounds  over.     Is  it  a  good  return'.' 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXVIII.  During  play  a  ball  is  thrown  into  court,  and  the  ball  in 
play  strikes  it  or  a  player  steps  on  it.     May  a  let  be  claimed'.' 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXIX.  The  server's  first  service  strikes  his  partner.  Does  he  lose 
the  stroke  or  is  it  a  fault'? 

Decision. — A  fault. 

XXX.  A  player  serves  a  fault  and  it  is  then  discovered  that  it  is- 
his  partner's  service.     Does  the  fault  stand'.' 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXXI.  In  a  four-handed  competition  one  player  does  not  appear 
in  time  to  play,  and  his  partner  claims  to  be  allowed  to  play  single- 
handed  against  the  opposing  pair.     May  he  do  so'? 

Decision. — No. 


UNOFFICIAL  DECISIONS  ON  DOUBTFUL  POINTS. 
(From  Laivn  Tennis.) 
Both    of   the   opponents    of   the   servers    in   doubles   are    strikers-out 
alternately  during  a  game.     It  is  optional  with  them  which  shall  serve 
first,  but  they  must  serve  alternately  thi-oughout  each  set. 

A  player  does  not  lose  a  stroke  for  striking  at  a  ball  that  ulti- 
mately falls  outside  his  court,  providing  he  does  not  touch  it  in 
doing' so. 


232  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

If  one  partner  of  a  double  team  strikes  at  a  ball  and  does  not 
touch  it,  his  partner  still  has  the  right  to  return  it.  A  player  or 
different  member  of  a  team  may  strike  at  a  ball  as  often  as  they 
please  ;  it  is  still  in  play  until  hit. 

A  served  ball  is  only  a  "let"  if  otherwise  good,  falling  in  the  proper 
court ;  a  fault  cannot  be  a  ••let." 

The  server  must  stand  behind  the  base-line,  within  the  limits  of  the 
side-lines  of  the  court  in  which  he  is  playing. 

There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  ••let"  balls  that  may  be  made 
on  the  service,  and  the  server  continues  serving  in  the  same  court 
until  a  good  service  is  delivered  or  two  faults  are  made. 

The  server  must  wait  until  the  striker-out  is  ready  for  the  second 
service  as  well  as  the  first,  and  if  the  striker-out  claims  to  be  not 
ready  and  does  not  make  any  effort  to  return  the  second  service,  the 
server  cannot  claim  the  point,  even  though  the  service  was  good. 

If  a  player's  racket  touches  the  net  after  the  ball  has  struck  the 
net,  he  does  not  lose  the  point.  The  ball  is  dead  and  the  point  has 
been  won  and  lost  as  soon  as  the  ball  strikes  the  net,  and  nothing 
which  happens  afterward  can  affect  that  point.  If  the  ball  knocks 
the  net  against  the  player's  racket  the  same  decision  holds  good; 
it  is  simply  a  question  for  the  referee  to  decide  which  touches  the 
net  first. 

In  doubles  partners  must  receive  throughout  each  set  on  the  same 
sides  of  the  court  which  they  originally  select  when  the  set  begins. 
The  first  server  is  not  required  to  receive  in  the  right  court ;  he  may 
select  either  side  at  the  beginning  of  the  set,  but  must  hold  this  to 
the  end. 

A  ball  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  bounds  back  over  the  net  after 
having  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  service.  TTie  point  counts 
in  favor  of  the  server  if  the  striker-out  fails  to  return  it.  The  latter 
may  reach  over  the  net  to  return  the  ball,  but  loses  the  point  if  he 
touches  the  net   in  doing  so. 

A  return  made  from  one  side  of  the  court  that  passes  outside  of  the 
net  and  posts  without  going  over  them  is  still  good  if  th''  ball  falls 
in  the  proper  court. 

The  ball  is  always  in  play  until  it  has  struck  the  ground  outside 
of  the  court,  or  the  net,  or  has  touched  the  ground  twice.  The  player 
loses  a  point  if  the  ball  touches  him  or  his  clothing  while  still  in  play, 
no  matter  whether  he  is  standing  outside  of  the  court  when  the  ball 
hits  him,   or  not. 

An  olBcially  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that  makes  any 
support  of  the  net — the  posts,  the  guy-ropes,  or  the  centre  fork — a 
part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hitting  one  of  the  supports  and 
still  striking  the  right  court  is  considered  a  good  return  (except  on 
the  service).  The  posts  are  required  to  stand  outside  of  the  court. 
and  yet  a  ball  being  returned  at  a  sharp  angle  from  outside  might 
well  be  going  in  and  still  touch  one  of  the  posts. 

A  ball  is  dead  the  instant  it  has  touched  the  ground  outside  of  the 
court,  and  the  point  must  be  scored  at  once  against  the  other  side, 
no  matter  what  happens  after  the  ball  touches  the  ground. 

Consolation  matches  in  America  are  always  open  to  anJ7  player 
beaten  in  his  first  match  actually  played.  "Winning  by  default  before 
defeat  in  the  first  actual  match  doe's  not  disqualify  a  player  from 
the  consolation  event. 

The  services  must  always  come  alternately  from  the  right  and  left 
courts  ;  if  the  server  delivers  the  ball  from  the  wrong  court  it  is  a 
fault. 

A  fault  cannot  be  played,  and  the  striker-out  has  no  option  in  the 
matter ;  it  does  not  make  the  service  good  if  he  returns  it.

9.     It  is  the  duty  of  an  Umpire — 

(a)  To  ascertain  that  the  net  is  at  the  right  height  before  the 
commencement  of  play,  and  to  measure  and  adjust  the  net  during 
play,  if  asked  to  do  so,  or  if,  in  his  opinion,  its  height  has  altered.

lie  delegates  such  power, 

(c)  To  call  the  strokes  when  won,  or  when  he  is  asked  to  call

whose  decision  shall  be  final. 

NOTE — A  question  of  fact  relates  to  events  that  actually  happened.  A 
question  of  law  is  the  construction  and  application  of  the  laws  of  the  game 
to  be  admitted  facts. 

12.  The  Referee  shall  not  bet  on  a  match  nor  shall  an  Umpire  or 
Linesman  on  the  match  to  which  he  is  assigned.  An  infraction  of 
this  rule  shall  be  followed  by  the  immediate  removal  of  the  offending 
Referee,  Umpire  or  Linesman  on   the   complaint   of  any   competitor. 

13.  No  competitor  may   transfer  his  entry   to  another  player. 

14.  Competitors  shall  have  a  right,  by  themselves  or  their  depu- 
ties, to  be  present  at  the  draw. 

15.  The  draw  shall  be  conducted  in  the  following  manner:  Each 
competitor's  name  shall  be  written  on  a  separate  card  or  paper,  and 
these  shall  be  placed  in  a  bowl  or  hat,  drawn  out  one  by  one  at  ran- 
dom, and  copied  on  a  list  in  the  order  in  which  they  have  been  drawn. 


When  odds  are  owed,   they  should  be  marked  on  the  left  of  the  first  thick

When  two  players  in  different  classes  below  scratch  meet,  the  su- 
perior player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  recei%'ed  by  the 
inferior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table  No.  1.  To  use  the 
table,  find  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures  the  number  representing  the 
class  of  the  superior  player,  then  travel  along  the  horizontal  column 
until  the  vertical  column' is  reached  which  bears  at  the  top  the  num- 
ber of  the  class  of  the  inferior  player.  The  odds  specified  at  the  in- 
tersection of  the  two  columns  are  the  odds  required. 

Example. — If  class  3  has  to  meet  class  0.  start  from  the  figure  3 
in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures,  and  look  horizontally  until  the  vertical 
column  is  reached  headed  by  the  figure  0.  The  odds  given  at  the  point 
of  intersection  of  the  two  columns  (viz.  15  and  1-6  of  15)  are  the 
odds  required. 

When  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  worst  players  en- 
tered in  great  (say  more  than  30),  it  is  desirable  to  handicap  the 
best  players  at  owed  odds.  The  players  above  scratch  (i.  e.,  owing

When  the  two  players  >n  different  classes  above  scratch  meet,  the 
inferior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  owed  by  the 
superior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table,  No.  2. 

This  table  is  to  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  former,  the  class 
of  the  superior  player  being  looked  for  in  the  horizontal  line  of  fig- 
ures  at  the  top,  and  the  class  of  the  inferior  player  m  the  diagonal 
line  of  figures. 

Example. — If  class  12  (owe  30)  meet  class  7  (owe  15  and  1-6  of 
15).   the  former  must  owe  the  latter  the  odds  of  4-6  of  15. 

21.  In  Championship  matches  and  handicaps  by  classes,  as  above, 
advantage  sets  shall  be  played  throughout. 

22.  The  Committee  may,  whether  appealed  to  by  any  competitor 
or  not,  postpone  the  meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a  match  if.  ia 
their  opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the  light,  or  the  condi- 
tion of  the  ground,  or  other  circumstances,  render  it  advisable  to  do 
so.     Ia  cases  of  postponement,  Law  25  must  be  strictly  observed.

ties, the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better  player  is  required  to 
earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score,  while,  in  the  case  of 
given  odds,  the  poorer  player  is  given  his  handicap  l)efore  play  starts. 
These  owed  odds  may  be  used  either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds

244  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

or  separntely.  In  order  that  the  handicap?  may  occur  as  seldom  as 
possible  in  the  same  games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes 
odds  and  the  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes 
are  paid  dififer  from  those  on  which  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds  : 

One-sixth  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thirteenth 
and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  seventh, 
ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third, 
fifth  and  every  otber  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths'  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth,  sixth 
and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth,  fifth, 
6ixth  and  corresponding  games   in   each   set. 

Fifteen   (15)   is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1),  fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2).  fifteen 
and  three-sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty  i .  fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4), 
fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5),  thirty  (30),  thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.11, 
thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2).  thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- 
forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4).  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and 
forty  (40),  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger 
handicaps  in  the  table  for  given  odds  correspond  to  the  fractions  of 
fifteen   in   that  table. 

The  simplest  method  for  handicappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort  out  the 
entries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap  into  classes  according  to 
the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then  select  the  class  with  the  great- 
est number  of  players  in  it  and  place  them  on  scratcb,  handicapping 
all  of  the  other  players  either  behind  or  in  advance  of  scratch  by 
owed  or  given  odds,  so  as  to  make  all  even  at  the  odds. 

In  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as  compared 
with  the  scratch  men  should  first  be  considered,  and  then  as  compared 
with  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  tables  of  odds.  Each 
player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the  object  of  handicapping 
is  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chance,  no  matter  whom  his  opponent 
may   be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15,  or  any  fraction 
of  it,  than  it  is  to  give  it.  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given,  the  poorer 
player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the  end  of  the  game, 
and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best  men  must  be  very  great 
to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance,  should  they  meet. 

It  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorer  players  over  30.3  (half- 
forty),  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odds  run  higher 
than  30.  If  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  poorest  players 
is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary  behind  scratch,  but 
do  not  advance  the  former  to  more  than  30,  or  30.3  in  the  most  ex- 
treme cases. 


HOW  TO  CONDrCT  A  TOURNAMENT. 

A  tournament  committee  should  first  of  all  be  selected,  with  not 
less  than  five  men.  and  as  many  as  possible  practical  workers  who 
have  the  time  and  inclination  to  t'losely  look  after  the  interests  of  the 
club.  At  its  first  meeting,  the  committee  should  decide  upon  all  de- 
tails of  the  meeting.  In  selecting  a  date,  it  is  advisable  to  choose 
one  immediately  before  or  after  some  established  tournament  in  the 
neighborhood,  for  then  the  entries  of  those  who  are  to  play  in  the 
other  event  can  generally  be  secured. 

Application  should  be  made  to  the  national  governing  body  for 
oflScial  sanction  for  the  tournament,  stating  dates  and   other  particu- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  245 

lars.  If  any  cbampionsbip  events  are  to  be  on  tbe  programme,  official 
recognition  must  be  applied  for  before  these  titles  can  be  of  any  value. 

A  printed  circular  sbould  be  issued  by  the  tournament  committee, 
which  should  state  plainly — (1)  the  name  of  the  club  and  the  loca- 
tion of  the  courts;  (-)  the  date  of  the  meeting  and  the  hours  of  play; 
(li)  the  list  of  events,  and  the  championship  titles  (if  any)  to  be 
competed  for,  with  the  prizes  offered  for  each  event;  (4)  the  amount 
of  the  entrance  fees,  and  place  and  date  for  closing  the  list  of  entries  ; 
(o)  the  name  of  referee,  handicapper  and  tournament  committee;  and 
(G)   the  time  and  place  of  the  draw. 

The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  committee  in  public  and 
due  notice  of  the  time  and  place  be  given  to  the  competitors,  so  that 
they  may  be  present  or  represented  when  the  draw  is  made.  The 
draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  Bagnall-Wilde  system.  (See 
••Tournament    Regulations."; 

No  money  or  its  equivalent  in  any  form  should  be  offered  as  prizes, 
lor  this  would  disqualify  tlie  players  from  future  competition  as  ama- 
teurs. I'rizes  should  be  silver,  gold,  cut  glass,  objects  of  art  or  other 
souvenirs  of  this  kind  that  can  be  marked  or  engraved  as  trophies. 
It  is  preferable  to  have  tlifiu  marked  before  the  tournament,  although 
lawn  tennis  prizes  are  frecjuentiy  bought  with  the  piivllege  of  ex- 
change, and   tliereiore  not  engraved   until   after  the   tournament. 

The  committee  should  select  a  referee,  either  from  among  their  num- 
ber or  outside  of  it.  If  handicaps  are  to  be  held,  the  referee  may 
also  be  the  handicapper,  or  a  sub-committee  may  be  appointed  for  this 
purpose.  Should  the  referee  be  also  a  competitor,  a  substitute  should 
also  be  appointed  to  act  for  him  while  he  is  playing. 

It  is  important  to  have  enough  balls,  and  only  the  best  quality  of 
tournament  balls  should  be  used  for  matches.  It  is  the  custom  at  most 
tournaments  to  allow  three  new  balls  with  each  match,  but  in  play- 
ing on  dirt  courts,  the  same  balls  can  sometimes  be  made  to  do  service 
twice.  T^nless  there  are  back-stops  close  behind  the  courts,  it  is  also 
v/ell  to  have  some  small  boys  handy  to  act  as  ball-boys  and  "shack" 
the  balls  lor  the  players. 

The  lines  of  a  tournament  court  should  be  marked  out  fi'esh  every 
day  and  if  easily  obliterated,  also  between  matches  on  the  same  day. 
The  courts  should  always  be  laid  north  and  south  so  that  one  player 
will  not  get  more  than  his  share  of  the  glaring  sunlight  in  his  eyes. 
There  should  never  be  a  ti'ee  within  shadow  distance  of  a  tournament 
court  eitiier.  particularly  ou   the  soutli   side  of  the  court. 

Facilities  must  be  provided  for  the  players  to  dress,  and  it  is  a 
good  plan  to  appoint  one  member  of  the  committee  to  attend  to  these 
acenmmodations.  and  to  entertain  the  visiting  players  and  see  that 
their  wants  are  attended  to. 

The  draw  should  always  be  posted  in  a  conspicuous  place  on  the 
grounds,  where  the  spectators  as  well  as  the  players  can  inspect  it. 
If  possible  a  programme  for  each  day's  play  should  be  made  out  in 
advance,  and  due  notice  of  all  the  matches  of  the  day  be  posted  up  by 
the  draw  each  day.  The  courts  should  be  numbered,  and  a  certain 
court  and  hour  set  for  each  match.  One  member  of  the  committee 
ought  also  to  be  assigned  to  getting  umpires  for  the  matches  and 
seeing  that  they   are  properly  started. 

It  is  customary  to  exhibit  the  prizes  for  a  tournament  at  the  club 
grounds  during  the  tournament,  and  it  generally  proves  an  attractive 
feature  to  have  them  displayed  on  a  table  on  the  grounds,  all  duly 
labeled  so  that  spectators  can  see  which  events  they  are  to  be  given 
for.  A  refreshment  tent  is  also  an  attractive  feature  at  a  tourna- 
ment and  the  prizes  are  then  displayed  under  this  tent  on  the  same 
or  a  nearby  table  with  the  punchbowl.  Lemonade,  or  tea,  crackers, 
cakes  and  sometimes  small  sandwiches  are  generally  served  to  the 
players   and  spectators  under  such  refreshment  tent. 


246  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

How  to  Build  and  Keep  a  Court 

Nothing  is  more  important  for  the  full  enjoyment  of  lawn  tennis 
than  a  satisfactory  court,  and  none  of  the  other  accessories  of  the 
game  ofifers  a  wider  variety.  Many  important  considerations  come  up 
even  after  the  kind  of  court  to  be  built,  and  the  cost,  have  been  de- 
cided upon.  No  matter  how  much  is  to  be  spent  on  the  ground,  nor 
what  the  surface  is  to  be,  the  most  important  things  to  consider  first 
are  space,  light  and  drainage. 

The  back-stop  nettingrs  should  never  be  nearer  than  fifteen  feet  to 
the  lines,  and  if  good  players  are  expected  to  use  the  court,  particu- 
larly if  tournament  matches  are  to  take  place  on  it.  the  space  behind 
the  base-line  should  be  21  feet  at  each  end.  At  the  sides  at  least 
6  feet,  if  possible  12  feet  should  be  allowed  beyond  the  side-lines  for 
doubles  of  each  court.  A  well-appointed  court  for  tournament  play 
should  be  centered  in  an  unobstructed  space  of  not  less  than  GO  x  120 
feet.  Wire  back-stop  netting  10  or  12  feet  high  should  surround  it 
at  these  distances  from  the  lines.  If  there  are  two  or  more  courts 
together,  there  should  be  at  least  12  feet  between  their  side  lines,  and 
one   netting  can  surround  all. 

In  selecting  a  site  for  a  court,  a  spot  should  be  chosen  where  there 
Is  always  plenty  of  sunlight,  and  where  at  no  time  of  the  day  does 
any  shadow  cross  the  ground  on  which  the  court  is  to  be  laid.  Green 
or  black  is  a  preferable  background  to  play  against,  but  any  dark  and 
even  color  will  do.  A  court  should  never  be  laid  out  with  any  very 
light  background  within  a  short  distance  at  either  end,  or  close  at 
either  side.  Nor  should  a  site  be  selected  with  a  badly  mixed  or 
'moving  background.  Shade  trees  are  useful  near  a  court,  only  if  their 
shadow  is  a  solid  one,  not  constantly  checkered  by  flecks  of  sunlight 
glittering  through  moving  branches,  which  constantly  confuse  the 
players.  Never  should  they  be  allowed  near  enough  to  cast  any 
shadows  on  the  playing  surface. 

One  more  cardinal  point  should  be  remembered.  The  court  should 
invariably  be  laid  out  north  and  south — never  east  and  west.  If  this 
warning  is  disregarded,  th^  player  at  one  end  or  the  other  will  be  hope- 
lessly blinded  by  the  sun.  k 

The  question  of  drainage  is  one  of  the  most  important  considerations 
in  selecting  a  site  of  this  kind.  On  the  natural  facilities  depends 
largely  the  cost  of  laying  out  a  good  court.  If  the  natural  soil  be 
sandy  and  well  drained,  or  if  it  is  on  high  ground  which  slopes  away 
sear  by,  artificial  drain'  pipes  will  not  have  to  be  put  in,  and  this 
saves  much  of  the  cost,  but  if  it  be  thick  clay  that  holds  moisture  long, 
or  on  low  ground  with  neighboring  slopes  that  drain  toward  it,  the 
court  will  be  useless  for  many  hours  after  each  rainfall  unless  artificial 
drain-pipes  are  put  in. 

After  the  site  has  been  selected,  it  must  be  decided  whether  a  grass 
or  "dirt"  court  is  to  be  built.  If  the  natural  sod  is  luxuriant  and  the 
soil  favorable  for  its  growth,  or  if  the  court  is  not  to  be  used  enough 
to  wear  off  the  grass,  a  turf  court  will  generally  be  found  preferable, 
but  if  the  ground  is  to  be  constantly  in  use,  the  sod  will  wear  off  and 
become  "bald"  unless  there  is  space  enough  on  the  lawn  to  shift  the 
court  frequently. 

When  good  turf  cannot  be  had  or  will  not  stand  the  wear,  a  substi- 
tute must  be  found,  and  sand  or  dirt  courts  are  most  often  used. 
On  well-drained  land,  one  can  sometimes  cut  away  the  top  surface, 
level  the  ground  and  roll  it  until  well  hardened  and  the  court  is  ready 
for  use,  but  more  preparation  is  necessary  to  build  a  permanent  court 
that  will  not  be  constantly  losing  its  proper  level. 

For  such  a  court  the  earth  should  be  cut  away  to  a  depth  of  one. 
f»ot  if  no  drains  are  required.    After  leveling  it  carefully  with  a  spirit-

Kure  of  tho  roller  produces  should  be  filled  in  or  cut  down  before  the 
sods  are  relaid. 

After  the  ground  has  been  rolled  ?uflBciently  the  sods  should  be 
replaced.  In  doing  this  it  is  important  to  get  the  edges  close  together, 
so  that  no  seams  or  open  cracks  can  be  found.  These  sods  should  be 
relaid  in  the  afternoon  and  well  drenched  with  water.  The  next  day 
the  ground  should  be  rolled  again  :  and  this'  should  be  followed  by 
alternate  drenching  and  rolling  for  several  days.  Even  when  the 
ground  finally  appears  firm  and  level,  the  court  should  not  be  played 
upon  until  new  blades  of  grass  appear  in  considerable  numbers.  If 
depressions  appear,  the  sod  at  that  spot  should  be  lifted,  fresh  earth 
inserted  to  the  proper  grade  and  the  sod  replaced,  watered  and  rolled 
till  level  and  flat  again. 

Bad  spots  are  often  found  where  the  grass  i^  thin  or  where  malignant 
weeds  obstruct  its  growth,  and  in  this  case  fresh  sods  should  be 
bought  or  cut  elsewhere  and  substituted.  Sometimes  large  patches  of 
ground  must  be  renewed  in  this  way.  but  it  will  be  found  much  less 
expensive  if  all  the  turf  is  bad  to  sow  the  new  court  down  with  lawn 
seeds,  and  seeds  will  often  help  out  thin  spots  in  the  grass  if  the 
court  is  not  to  be  used  too  soon  after  the  sowing.  It  is  better  to  make 
a  grass  court  in  the  fall  whether  it  is  to  be  sown  with  seed  or  sodded. 
The  winter  storms  will  then  settle  it  thoroughly,  and  after  a  little 
releveling  in  the  spring  it  will  be  ready  for  use. 

Grass  seeds  should  be  sown  Detween  the  middle  of  March  and  the 
first  of  May,  or  better  yet.  in  the  autumn,  between  the  middle  of 
August  and  the  first  of  October.  It  takes  about  20  pecks  of  good 
lawn  seed  to  cover  a  space  60  by  lilO  feet.  The  sowing  should  be 
gone  over  twice,  the  second  time  at  right  angles  to  the  first.  Clover 
seeds  should  be  avoided,  as  this  grass  does  not  wear  well,  and  guano 
should  not  be  used  for  fertilizing,  for  it  tends  to  bring  up  coarse  blades 
in  patches. 

As  soon  as  the  young  grass  is  high  enovgh  to  be  topped,  a  scythe  or 
sickle  should  be  used,  being  at  first  better  than  the  mowing  machine. 
After  the  new  grass  is  well  hardened,  however,  the  latter  should  be 
constantly  in  use.  never  less  than  once  a  week,  and  in  moist  warna 
weather  nearly  every  day.  With  every  precaution  weeds  are  sure  to 
appear,  but  these  can  generally  be  held  in  check  by  constant  mowing. 
Tlie  more  formidable  weeds,  however,  must  be  cut  with  a  knife  one  by 
one  about  an  inch  below  the  surface,  and  care  being  taken  to  remove 
as  much  of  the  root  as  possible.  A  pinch  of  salt  dropped  on  the  cut 
root  will  generally  stop  the  growth.  When  the  turf  becomes  worn  in 
spots  a  small  shift  in  the  lines  of  the  court  will  relieve  the  pressure 
and  enable  the  grass  to  grow  again  ;  at  the  end  of  the  season  all  of 
the  bare  patches  should  be  resown. 

There  are  several  other  kinds  of  courts  sometimes  built  when  turf 
cannot  be  had.  Cinders,  clay,  concrete,  cement  and  asphalt  are  also 
sometimes  used,  while  board  courts  are  built  undercover  for  winter  use. 

Concrete  and  cement  are  open  to  many  objections.  They  are  very 
hard  on  the  eyes  and  legs,  and  often  make  the  player's  feet  sore  ;  the 
surface  generally  wears  out  the  balls  and  shoes  quickly,  and  it  is  also 
liable  to  crack  with  frost.  Cinder  courts  are  cheap  and  easy  to  con- 
struct, but  the  surface  is  so  gritty  that  it  burns  the  feet  of  the  players 
and  soon  uses  up  the  balls.  They  are  also  very  dirty.  Asphalt  courts 
are  expensive  and  much  affected  by  heat  and  cold,  sometimes  even 
cracking  with  the  frost. 

In  Australia  courts  have  been  made  of  cracked  blue-stone,  while  a 
cheaper  substitute  has  been  found  in  England  in  what  is  called  a  brick 
rubble   court. 

Once  the  court  is  finally  built  and  ready  for  use,  it  must  be  properly 
marked  out.      In  every  case,  unless  it  be  of  grass,  and  the   lines  are

to  be  constantly  shifted  to  prevent  bare  spots,  net-posts  should  be 
permanently  sunk  in  the  ground.  They  should  be  not  less  than  two 
feet  under  the  ground  nor  forty  feet  apart.  ^    ^      ui^ 

A  good  dirt  court  should  be  swept,  watered,  rolled  and  freshly 
marked  out  after  every  eight  or  ten  sets  of  play,  and  opener  in  very 
dJT  wearher  Instantlv  a  depression  is  discovered  it  should  be  filled 
in'  and  rolled  down  before  playing  is  continued,  for  it  is  almost  as 
dangerous  for  the  players  as  the  court  to  continue  with  it  uneven. 
A  court  should  never  be  rolled  in  the  condition  the  players  leave  it 
after  plav.  A  player's  heel  raises  a  little  lump  :  if  the  roller  goes  oyer 
this  before  it  is  swept  down  even  again,  a  hard  ridge  results  and  the 
bail  will  bound  unevenly  from  it.  It  should  be  swept  over  first,  until 
all    the   lumps   are    leveled   down,    before    the   roller   is   allowed   on    its

bottom  edges,  fastened  to  its  bottom  and  trailing  on  behind  u  Ihis 
should  be  drawn  over  the  court  with  a  handle  or  rope  several  tmes. 
If  it  is  pushed,  the  groundsman's  feet  will  leave  tracks  attei  it  -if  he

if  the  broom  is  constantly  used  along  the  lines  in  a  parallel  direction, 
it  will  gradually  wear  away  little  grooves  in  the  court  where  the  .ines 
are  and  the  luUls  will  bound  improperly  from  them.  The  sweep  ng 
should    be    done    lightly    across    the    court,    at    right    angles    with    the

thoroughly  several  times  a  week  and  roll  it  as  often  It  should  be

before  watering  The  best  way  to  repair  a  bare  strip  of  ground  is  to 
lay  fresh  turf  and  this  should  be  done  in  the  fall  or  as  early  as  pos- 
sible in  the  spring.  Good  tough  turf,  laid  in  February  or  early  in 
March  will  be^  fit  for  use  by  the  first  of  June.  In  the  early  spring

hard  lumns  are  formed  which  spoil  the  surface  of  the  court.  Ihe  turf

How  to  Lay  Out  a  Tennis  Court 


A8  a  double  court  practically  includes  every  line  to  be  found  in  a 
single  court,  it  is  best  to  take  first  the  measure  for  the  latter.  Hav- 
ing determined  the  position  of  your  net,  plant  in  the  ground,  in  the 
line  chosen,  two  pegs,  27  feet  apart  (at  the  points  A  and  B  in  the 
diagram*.  Then  take  two  measures  and  attach  their  respective  ends 
to  the  pegs  A  and  B.  On  the  first,  which  will  measure  the  diagonal 
of  the  court,  take  a  length  of  47  feet  5  inches  ;  on  the  other  39  feet ; 
pull  both  taut  in  such  directions  that  at  these  distances  they  nieet 
in  a  point  C.  This  will  give  one  comer  of  the  court.  At  that  point  F, 
21  feet  from  B,  put  in  a  peg  to  mark  the  end  of  the  service-line.  The 
other  corner,  D,  and  the  other  end  of  the  service-line  O,  may  be 
found  by  interchanging  the  measures  and  repeating  the  process.  The 
same  measurements  on  the  other  side  of  the  net  will  complete  the 
exterior  boundaries  of  the  court.  By  prolonging  the  base-line  4  feet 
6  inches  in  each  direction,  and  joining  the  four  new  points  thus 
obtained,  we  can  make  the  side-lines  of  a  double  court.  It  only 
remains  to  mark  the  central  line.  This  is  done  by  joining  the  middle 
points  of  the  service-lines.  If  a  double  court  alone  be  required,  the 
Interior  side-lines  need  not  be  prolonged  to  meet  the  base-lines. 
Remember  that  in  all  cases  the  net-posts  must  stand  at  a  distance 
of  three  feet  from  the  side-lines.

pointed  at  lower  end  so  as  to 
go  24  inches  into  ground  and 
equipped  with  wheel  at  top.

Spalding  "  AutO-Loc" 
Tennis  Posts 

We  recommend  these  posts  especially  for  private 
courts  or  wherever  it  is  desirable  to  remove  posts 
immediately  after  play  is  finished.  The  "Auto- 
Loc' '  tightening  ratchet  is  a  patented  device  which 
permits  the  closest  adjustment  in  tightening  and 
regulating  the  height  of  the  net,  and  locks  auto- 
matically and  instantly  as  soon  as  released. 

The  spade-shaped  iron  sockets  with  which 
these  posts  are  equipped  are  driven  into  the 
ground  in  the  proper  position  for  the  posts,  which 
are  fitted  with  iron  bases  teiTninating  in  square 
iron  extensions  which  fit  exactly  the  sockets  in 
the  spade  bases  and  keep  the  posts  -absolutely, 
rigid  when  placed  in  position.  When  posts  are 
removed  from  sockets  there  is  no  projecting 
obstruction,  and  we  furnish  a  block  of  wood  to 
be  inserted  in  the  hole  in  each  socket  as  soon  as 
the  posts  are  taken  up.  We  also  furnish  hooks 
with  handles  for  removing  sockets  from  ground 
whenever  it  may  be  necessary  to  do  so.

"Cork  Center"  Ball  makes  the  game  faster -we  have 
the  testimony  of  hundreds  of  players  to  this  effect 
it  makes  it  more  accurate  and  even,  the  ball  holding 
its  life  right  through  the  game- not  getting  soggy  or 
dead  in  the  last  innings- "you  can  make  a  home  run 
in  the  ninth  inning  as  easily  as  in  the  first,  as  Koger 
Bresnahan  says.  .      ,   ^         ■  ,  .u 

It  is  well  for  the  youth  of  America  to  learn  the 
lesson  that  while  the  cheapest  things  are  very  seldom 
the  best  things,  the  best  are  always  the  cheapest 
in   the   end.     The  pnce  of  the  genuine  Spalding 

^'Official  National  League"  Ball  is  $1-25 

each -no  more  and  no  less.  The  market  abounds 
with  so-called  "League  Balls."  all  listed  at  $  .25  each 
for  the  sole  purpose  of  deceiving  the  purchaser  and 
enabling  the  "just  as  good"  dealer  to  work  the  dis- 
count scheme  on  the  boy  who  is  not  posted. 

This  is  the  reason  why  bright  boys  always  insist 
upon  the  Spalding  Ball  and  decline  to  accept  any 
substitute.  To  many  parents,  a  ball  is  a  ball;  but  to 
the  American  lad  who  knows,  only  a  Spalding  Ball  is 
the  genuine  and  Official  Ball  of  the  garne  and  substi- 
tution of  "something  equally  as  good  does  not  go 
with  him.  for  he  has  learned  that  to  become  a  good 
_ball  playe.  and  get  the  greatest  pleasure  out  of  the 
gam^he  must  use  the  same  ball  ^1^^'  ^>  ^«  'fi^'"!

Standard  Policy 

A  Standard  Quality  mvist  be  inseparably  linked  to  a  Standard  Policy. 

Without  a  definite  and  Standard  Mercantile  Policy,  it  is  impossible  for  a  manufacturer  to  long 
maintain  a  Standard  Quality. 

To  market  his  goods  through  the  jobber,  a  manufacturer  must  provide  a  profit  for  the  jobber  as 
well  as  the  retail  dealer.  To  meet  these  conditions  of  Dual  Profits,  the  manufacturer  is  obliged  to 
Bet  a  proportionately  high  list  price  on  his  goods  to  the  consumer. 

To  enable  the  glib  salesman,  when  booking  his  orders,  to  figure  out  attractive  profits  to  both  the 
jobber  and  retailer,  these  high  list  prices  are  absolutely  essential;  but  their  real  purpose  will  have  been 
served  when  the  manufacturer  has  secured  his  order  from  the  jobber,  and  the  jobber  has  secured  his 
order  from  the  retailer. 

However,  these  deceptive  high  list  prices  are  not  fair  to  the  consumer,  who  does  not,  and,  in 
reality,  is  n»t  ever  expected  to  pay  these  fancy  list  prices. 

When  the  season  opens  for  the  sale  of  such  goods,  with  their  misleading  but  alluring  high  list 
prices,  the  retailer  begins  to  realize  his  responsibilities,  and  grapples  with  the  situation  as  best  he 
can,  by  offering  "special  discounts,"  which  vary  with  local  trade  conditions. 

Under  this  system  of  merchandising,  the  profits  to  both  the  manufacturer  and  the  jobber  are 
assured;  but  as  there  is  no  stability  maintained  in  the  prices  to  the  consumer,  the  keen  competition 
amongst  the  local  dealers  invariably  leads  to  a  demoralized  cutting  of  prices  by  which  the  profits  of 
the  retailer  are  practically  eliminated. 

This  demoralization  always  reacts  on  the  manufacturer.  ^The  jobber  insists  on  lower,  and  still 
lower,  prices.  The  manufacturer  in  his  turn,  meets  this  demand  for  the  lowering  of  prices  by  the 
only  way  open  to  him,  viz. :  the  cheapening  and  degrading  of  the  quality  of  his  product 

The  foregoing  conditions  became  so  intolerable  that,  ten  years  ago,  in  1899,  A.  G.  Spalding 
%  Bros,  determined  to  rectify  this  demoralization  in  the  Athletic  Goods  Trade,  and  inaugurated  what 
has  since  become  known  as  "The  Spalding  Policy." 

The  "Spalding  Policy"  eliminates  the  jobber  entirely,  so  far  as  Spalding  Goods  are  concerned,'' 
and  the  retail  dealer  secures  his  supply  of  Spalding  Athletic  Goods  direct  from  the  manufacturer 
under  a  restricted  retail  price  arrangement  by  which  the  retail  dealer  is  assured  a  fair,  legitimate  and 
certain  profit  on  all  Spalding  Athletic  Goods,  and  the  consumer  is  assured  a  Standard  Quality  and  is 
protected  from  imposition. 

The  "Spalding  Policy"  is  decidedly  for  the  interest  and  protection  of  the  users  of  Athletic  Goods, 
and  acts  in  two  ways: 

FmsT— The  uner  is  assured  of  genuine  Official  Standard  Athletic  Goods,  and 

the  same  fixed  prices  to  everybody 
Second— As  manufacturers,  we  can  proceed  with  confidence  in  purchasing  at 
the  proper  time,  the  very  best  raw  materials  required  in  the  manufacture 
of  our  various  goods,  well  ahead  of  their  respective  seasons,  and  this  enables 
us  to  provide  the  necessary  quantity  and  absolutely  maintain  the  Spalding 
Standard  of  Quality. 
All  retail  dealers  handling  Spalding  Athletic  Goods  are  required  to  supply  consumers  at  our 
regular  printed  catalogue  prices— neither  more  nor  less— the  same  prices  that  similar  goods  are  sold 
for  in  our  New  York,  Chicago  and  other  stores. 

All  Spalding  dealers,  as  well  as  users  of  Spalding  Athletic  Goods,  are  treated  exactly  alike,  and  no 
special  rebates  or  discriminations  are  allowed  to  anyone. 

Positively,  nobody;  not  even  officers,  managers,  salesmen  or  other  employes  of  A.  G.  Spalding 
&  Bros.,  or  any  of  their  relatives  or  personal  friends,  can  buy  Spalding  Athletic  Goods  at  a  discount 
from  the  regular  catalogue  prices. 

This,  briefly,  is  the  "Spalding  Policy,"  which  has  already  been  in  successful  operation  for  the 
past  ten  years,  and  will  be  indefinitely  continued. 

Id  other  words.  "  The  Spalding  Policy  "  is  a  "square  deal "  for  everybody.

standard  Quality 

An  article  that  is  universally  given  the  appellation  ** Standard"  is  thereby 
•-onceded  to  be  the  Criterion,  to  which  are  compared  all  other  things  of  a  similar  nature, 
.^or  instance,  the  Gold  Dollar  of  the  United  States  is  the  Standard  unit  of  currency, 
)ecause  it  must  legally  contam  a  specific  proportion  of  pure  gold,  and  the  fact  of  its 
)eing  Genuine  is  guaranteed  by  the  Government  Stamp  thereon.  As  a  protection  to 
.he  users  of  this  currency  against  counterfeiting  and  other  tricks,  considerable  money 
s  expended  in  maintaining  a  Secret  Service  Bureau  of  Experts.  Under  the  law,  citizen 
nanufacturers  must  depend  to  a  great  extent  upon  Trade-Marks  and  similar  devices 
;o  protect  themselves  against  counterfeit  products — without  the  aid  of  "Government 
Detectives "  or  "Public  Opinion "  to  assist  them. 

Consequently  the  "Consumer's  Protection "  against  misrepresentation  and  "in- 
;.'erior  quality"  rests  entirely  upon  the  integrity  and  responsibility  of  the  "Manufacturer." 

A.  G.  Spalding  &  Bros,  have,  by  their  rigorous  attention  to  "Quality,"  for  thirty- 
ihree  years,  caused  their  Trade-Mark  to  become  known  throughout  the  world  as  a 
Guarantee  of  Quality  as  dependable  in  their  field  as  the  U.  S.  Currency  is  in  its  field. 

The  necessity  of  upholding  the  guarantee  of  the  Spalding  Trade-Mark  and  main- 
;aining  the  Standard  QuaUty  of  their  Athletic  Goods,  is,  therefore,  as  obvious  as  is  the 
necessity  of  the  Government  in  maintaining  a  Standard  Currency. 

Thus  each  consumer  is  not  only  insuring  himself  bat  also  protecting  other  con- 
;umers  when  he  assists  a  Reliable  Manufacturer  in  upholding  his  Trade-Mark  and  all 
Jhat  it  stands  for.  Therefore,  we  urge  all  users  of  our  Athletic  Goods  to  assist  us  in 
naintaining  the  Spalding  Standard  of  Excellence,  by  insisting  that  our  Trade-Mark  be 
)lainly  stamped  on  all  athletic  goods  which  they  buy,  because  without  this  precaution 
)ur  best  efforts  towards  maintaining  Standard  Quality  and  preventing  fraudulent 
ubstitution  will  be  ineffectual 

Manufacturers  of  Standard  Articles  invariably  suffer  the  reputation  of  being 
ligh-priced,  and  this  sentiment  is  fostered  and  emphasized  by  maJters  of  "inferior 
;oods,"  with  whom  low  prices  are  the  main  consideration. 

A  manufacturer  of  recognized  Standard  Goods,  with  a  reputation  to  uphold  and  a 
guarantee  to  protect,  must  necessarily  have  higher  prices  than  a  manufacturer  of  cheap 
joods,  whose  idea  of  and  basis  for  a  claim  for  Standard  Quality  depends  principally 
zpon  the  eloquence  of  the  salesman. 

We  know  from  experience  that  there  is  no  quicksand  more  unstable  than  poverty 
Q  quality— and  we  avoid  this  quicksand  by  Standard  Quality.
