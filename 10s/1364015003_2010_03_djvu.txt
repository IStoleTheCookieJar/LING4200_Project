1364.0.15.003 - Modellers' Database, Mar 2010 


Previous ISSUE Released at 11:30 AM (CANBERRA TIME) 14/07/2010 


Summary 


About this Release 


The Modellers' Database consists of 410 quarterly times series constructed from the NIF 
and TRYM econometric models. Some of the time series are published elsewhere by ABS 
while others are specifically constructed for the TRYM and NIF models. Users should be 
aware that missing observations in some time series may be filled with synthetic, modelled 


estimates. 


The ABS Job Vacancies Survey (JVS), conducted in February, May, August and November 
of the year, and from which the time series Job Vacancies (NV) in the Modellers Database is 
based, was suspended from August 2008 to August 2009 inclusive. It was, however, 
reinstated in November 2009. As a result of the suspension, there was a gap in the time 
series which was filled by Treasury using TRYM model-derived figures. Following the 
reinstatement of the JVS the Modellers Database Dec quarter 2009 contains a Job 
Vacancies series that has the actual November 2009 figure and includes modelled job 
vacancies figures for the gap period mentioned above.
