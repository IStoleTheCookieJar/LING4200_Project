Pittsburg  Press: — "Historical  incidents  abound  and  the  book  is  an 
excellent  authority  on  the  famous  sport." 

Philadelphia  Telegraph : — "In  this  book  Mr.  Spalding  has  written  the 
most  complete  and  authoritative   story   of  base   ball  yet  published." 

New  York  Herald: — "If  there  is  anyone  in  the  country  competent  to 
write  a  book  on  base  ball  it  is  A.  G.  Spalding,  who  has  been  interested 
in  the  game  from  its  early  beginnings.  ' 

I.  E.  Sanborn,  Chicago  Tribune: — "'America's  National  Game'  has 
teen  added  to  the  Tribune's  sporting  reference  library  as  an  invaluable 
contribution   to  the   literature   of  the    national   pastime." 

O.  C.  Reichard,  Chicago  Daily  News: — "It  is  cleverly  written  and 
presents  information  and  dates  of  great  value  to  the  newspaper  man 
of   to-day!" 

George  C.  Rice,  Chicago  Journal: — "I  have  read  the  book  through, 
and  take  pleasure  in  stating  that  it  is  a  complete  history  of  the  game 
from  the  beginning  until  the  present  time." 

Sherman  R.  Duffy,  Sporting  Editor  Chicago  Journal: — "It  is  a  most 
interesting  work  and  one  for  which  there  was  need.  It  is  the  most 
valuable   addition   to  base  ball  literature   that  has   yet  been    put   out." 

Joseph  H.  Vila,  New  York  Sun: — "I  have  read  it  carefully  and  with 
much  interest.  It  is  the  best  piece  of  base  ball  literature  I  have  ever 
seen,  and  I  congratulate  you  on  the  work." 

Tim  Murnane,  Sporting  Editor  Boston  Globe:— "You  have  given  to 
the  world  a  book  of  inestimable  value,  a  classic  in  American  history; 
a  book  that  should  be  highly  prized  in  every  home  library  in  the 
country."  "  ^  "" 

Francis  C.  Richter,  Editor  Sporting  Life,  Philadelphia: — "From  a 
purely  literary  standpoint,  your  work  is  to  me  amazing.  Frankly,  1 
would  not  change  a  line,  for  the  reason  that  the  story  is  told  in  a  way 
to   grip  the   reader  and  hold   his  interest  continually." 

Los  Angeles  Times  (editorial)  ; — "Spalding's  book  has  been  out  six 
■months  and  ninety  thousand  copies  have  been  sold.  We  understand 
there  will  be  other  editions.  America  has  taken  base  hall  seriously 
for  at  last  two  generations,  and  it  is  time  enough  that  the  fad  was 
given  an  adequate  text  book."  ,, 

Caspar  Whitney,  Editor  Outdoor  America,  and  one  of  the  leading 
authorities  in  the  world  on  sport: — "You  have  made  an  invaluable  con- 
tribution to  the  literature  of  the  game,  and  one  none  else  could  have 
made.  Moreover,  you've  done  some  very  interesting  writing,  which  is 
a  distinct  novelty  in  such  books — too  often  dull  and  uninteresting.'" 

New  York  World: — "Albert  G.  Spalding,  who  really  grew  up  with 
the  sport,  has  written  'America's  National  Game,'  which  he  describes 
as  not  a  history,  but  the  simple  story  of  the  game  as  he  has  come  to 
know  it.  His  book,  therefore,  is  full  of  living  interest.  It  is  a  volume 
generously  illustrated  and  abounds  in  personal  memories  of  base  ball 
in  the  making." 

New  York  Sun : — "There  is  a  mass  of  interesting  information  regard- 
ing base  ball,  as  might  be  expected,  in  Mr.  Spalding's  'America's 
National  Game.'  It  is  safe  to  say  that  before  Spalding  there  was  no 
"base  ball.  The  book  is  no  record  of  games  and  players,  but  it  is 
historical  in  a  broader  sense,  and  the  author  is  able  to  give  his  personal 
decisive,  testimony  about  many  disputed  points." 

Evening  Telegram,  New  York; — "In  clear,  concise,  entertaining,  nar- 
rative_  style,  Albert  G.  Spalding  has  contributed  in  many  respects  the 
most  interesting  work  pertaining  to  base  ball,  the  national  game,  whicli 
has   been   written. 

"There  is  so  much  in  it  of  interest  that  the  temptation  not  to  put 
it  down  until  it  is  completed  is  strong^  within  the  mind  of  every 
person  who  begins  to  read  it.  As  a  historical  record  it  is  one  of  those 
volumes  which  will  go  further  to  straighten  some  disputed  points  than 
all  of  the  arguments  which  could  be  advanced  in  good  natured  disputes 
•which   might   last  for   months  '•

American  Championship 

Commencing  on  Monday,  August  19,  and  continuing  for  a  full  week,  the 
thirty-second  annual  National  Championships  in  singles  and  doubles  were 
decided  on  the  Casino  Courts,  Newport,  R.  I.  The  competition  for  the 
1 91 2  honors  was  the  m.ost  noteworthy  in  the  history  of  the  National  titles,, 
as  precedents  were  established  in  a  number  of  instances.  Both  titles, 
changed  hands.  The  singles,  by  the  newly  instituted  rule  requiring  the 
champion  to  play  through,  went  to  Maurice  Evans  McLoughlin  of  Cali- 
fornia, who  paired  with  Thomas  C.  Bundy,  another  Californian,  accounted 
for  the  doubles.  William  A.  Larned  in  previous  years  had  been  the 
dominant  factor  in  the  singles  matches,  holding  the  title  since  1907.  In 
the  singles  the  victory  of  McLoughlin  was  in  the  final  round  of  the  tourna- 
ment,  there  being  no  challenge  round.  His  opponent  was  Wallace  F, 
Johnson,  and   the  match   went  five   sets. 

During  the  seven  days  of  competition  eleven  courts  were  used.  There 
was  a  field  of  159  players  in  the  singles.  A  separate  tournament  for  the 
scholastic  title  was  held.  The  celerity  with  which  everything  moved  was 
due,  first,  to  the  absence  of  rain,  and,  second,  to  the  excellent  management. 

The  absence  of  Champion  William  A.  Larned  spurred  the  little  group  of 
serious  contenders  to  their  best  endeavors,  while  it  whetted  the  appetite 
of  the  spectators  and  added  to  the  uncertainty  as  to  the  outcome.  The 
draw — unseeded  as  is  the  invariable  custom — was  a  good  one  and  seemed 
very  evenly  balanced.  But  the  balancing  between  the  halves  was  good 
only  on  paper.  The  non-appearance  of  Beals  Wright  left  a  big  hole;  then 
came  the  shock  of  Tuesday  morning  when  it  was  announced  that  Bundy 
was  ill  and  would  be  unable  to  play  that  day  in  either  singles  or  doubles;, 
and  thereafter  Bundy,  regarded  as  the  man  most  likely  to  fight  it  out 
with  Behr  for  the  final  bracket,  was  to  all  intents  and  purposes  eliminated;. 
Johnson  then  proceeded  to  confound  the  critics  by  defeating  Behr — and 
the  almost  impossible  had  happened — only  McLoughlin  stood  between  the 
Philadelphian   and   the  championship. 

The  top  half  stood  the  test  of  play  much  better.  McLoughlin  and 
Williams  met  in  the  sixth  round  on  Friday,  and  the  Californian  nosed  out 
a  victory,  after  a  great  five-set  battle.  It  was  the  one  hot  day  of  the 
meeting  and  both  men  suffered  severely.  The  Californian  had  a  bit  more 
in  reserve  at  the  end  and  won  thereby.  Williams  had  many  chances  to 
win  the  first  and  third  sets,  but  losing  them,  probably  missed  the  cham- 
pionship. Niles  was  eliminated  by  his  hoodoo,  Gardner;  Clothier  disposed 
of  Little  (who  had  routed  his  partner,  Touchard,  on  the  very  first  day), 
in  short  order  after  a  close  first  set  and  then  fell  before  McLoughlin  in  a 
close   and   finely  played   match. 

The  greatest  surprise  of  the  meeting  came  in  the  final  round.  Wallace 
Johnson — No.  3  in  1909,  but  the  victim  of  a  big  slump  in  the  succeeding 
years,  and  who  was  never  considered  a  factor  in  this  tournament — "came 
back"  with  a  vengeance  and  for  two  and  a  quarter  sets  played  the  sup- 
posedly invincible  McLoughlin  to  a  standstill.  The  Californian  was  anxious 
and  played  carefully  instead  of  carefreely,  a  mistake  that  he  realized  too 
late  to  take  any  chances.  Pulling  out  the  third  set  with  difficulty  he  lapsed 
slightly  in  the  fourth  and  Johnson  had  the  championship  almost  in  his 
grasp,  leading  at  2/0  and  4/3.  He  was  not  quite  equal  to  the  task,  '  ^w- 
ever,  and  McLoughlin  eventually  won  the  set  and  then  romped  through 
the   fifth. 

A  stubborn  battle  took  place  in  the  first  round  between  E.  M.  Pickman 
and  W.  P.  Burden.  The  latter  has  but  one  arm,  but  he  places  beautifully 
and  is  very  steady.  Pickman  got  him  at  the  end  of  five  sets.  Frank 
Sulloway    won    the    first    set    from    G.    P.    Gardner,    Jr.,    but   the   latter    took

Doubles   Champion    (with    M.    E.    McLoughliu)    of   the   United    States. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  7 

the  net  after  that  and  won  the  next  three.  The  German  crack,  H.  Klein- 
schroth,  won  the  first  set  from  Caner,  the  tall  Philadelphia  schoolboy, 
chiefly  because  the  latter  was  too  scared  to  take  advantage  of  his  oppo- 
nent's mistakes  and  weakness.  The  second  set  was  very  hard  fought,  but 
Caner  won  it   and   then  won   two   more   rather   easily. 

The  Little-Touchard  match  was  placed  on  the  grandstand  court  and 
,  proved  to  be  almost  a  farce.  Touchard  was  in  good  physical  condition- 
but  he  could  not  make  his  shots  go  in.  Nearly  everything  he  tried  went 
wrong,  and  toward  the  end  he  practically  "chucked  it."  Little  hit  hard, 
and   was   fairly  accurate. 

Gardner  Beals  of  Boston  proved  too  good  for  Allen  Tobey  of  Princeton^ 
winning  in  straight  sets.  A.  H.  Man,  Jr..  dropped  a  set  to  Pickman,  and 
had  to  work  hard  to  win.  Gardner  did  not  have  any  trouble  disposing  of 
Caner,  giving  the  youngster  only  five  games.  Richard  Stevens's  baseline 
giame  was  too  much  for  Drummond  Jones  of  St.  Louis,  the  latter  being 
unable  to  get  a  set.  C.  S.  Cutting  had  a  great  match  with  Arthur  Cragin,. 
.losing  the  third  and  fourth  sets,  but  proving  to  be  jtist  a  bit  too  steady  for 
the  New  Yorker.  W.  B.  Izard,  the  Navy  representative,  met  resistance 
from  the  German,  Feitshaus,  in  the  first  set  only.  The  best  match  of  this, 
the  second  round,  was  the  one  between  G.  M.  Church  and  J.  G.  Nelson, 
It  was  Princeton  against  Dartmouth,  and  the  former  won,  but  by  a  very 
close    margin. 

In  the  fourth  round  Biddle  won  in  straight  sets  from  Maynard,  while 
W.  M.  Hall  did  the  same  to  R.  D.  Gatewood,  although  in  this  case  each 
set  was  close.  Herd  was  too  speedy  for  Wendell  Kuhn,  of  Princeton,  but 
the  latter  managed  to  get  the  third  set.  Slocum's  steady  game  was  too 
much  for  R.  W.  Seabury,  although  the  latter  crowded  on  all  steam  in  the 
third  set  and  managed  to  win  it.  Man  got  a  set,  the  third,  from  Gardner 
and  worked  hard  for  more,  but  the  Bostonian  was  too  good,'  hitting  harder,, 
"getting"  more,  and  playing  more  aggressively.  Stevens  defeated  Rosen- 
baum  in  straight  sets.  Little  was  erratic  enough  to  be  forced  to  a  7/5  set 
with  the  veteran  R.  N.  Dana,  but  he  steadied  and  hit  harder  in  the  next 
two    and    won    them    easily. 

The  star  match  of  the  fourth  round  was  played  between  Clothier  and 
E.  P.  Larned  on  the  grandstand  court.  The  Philadelphian  got  going- 
quickly  and  ran  to  4/1  on  earned  shots.  Larned  speeded  up  and  began 
to  place  splendidly,  getting  to  4-all,  and  then  to  5/4.  He  became  unsteady 
again,  however,  and  Clothier  won  the  set  at  7/5.  Larned  led  at  4/3  in. 
the  second  set,  but  Clothier  ran  four  love  games  by  hard,  well  placed  shots. 
that    defeated    his    opponent    completely. 

Saturday  morning  was  given  over  to  the  semi-final  matches,  the  Behr- 
Johnson  battle  starting  first  on  the  court  next  to  the  locker  house.  All  that 
was  expected  of  Johnson  was  that  he  would  make  it  interesting  for  the 
New  Yorker,  and  when  the  latter  won  the  first  set  comfortably  at  6/4. 
nearly  everybody  prepared  to  go  over  to  the  grand  stand  court  to  watch 
McLoughlin  and  Clothier  settle  their  difficulties.  The  news,  brought  across 
subsequently,  that  Johnson  had  won  the  next  three  sets  and  would  be 
either  champion  or  runner-up  on  Monday,  had  a  stupefying  effect  on  the 
great    majority. 

In  the  first  set  the  score  went  to  4/all  on  service,  and  then  Behr  broke 
through,  following  with  the  win  of  his  own  delivery.  His  tactics  were 
simple  in  the  extreme.  He  went  to  the  net  with  the  greatest  regularity, 
and  once  there  strove  to  volley  for  the  win.  Johnson  employed  both  pass- 
ing strokes  and  lobs  against  him  and  prevailed  when  he  was  dead  accurate,, 
but  missed  when  his  shots  went  off  the  least  bit.  Behr  would  run  back 
for  the   lobs,   which  had   splendid  length,   and  charge   the   net   again. 

Johnson  won  his  own  service  in  the  second  set  and  then  broke  through 
Behr,  leading  at  2/0.  This  was  the  turning  point  of  the  match;  it  shook 
Behr's  confidence,  and  although  he  continued  to  struggle  for  the  net  posi- 
tion he  became  less  and  less  successful.  Johnson  won  four  more  games  in 
succession,   winning   the    set   at    love.      Behr    was    not    quite    done,    however. 


McLoughlin   and    Bundy   in   challenge    match    of   the   National    Championship 
Doubles  at  Newport,   August   21,    191 2. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  9 

and  he  got  two  games  in  the  third  set;  but  it  was  clearly  not  his  day,  and 
in  the  fourth  set  he  seemed  to  realize  the  hopelessness  of  his  struggle. 
The  fire  and  energy  was  there,  but  the  machine  was  not  working  smoothly 
and  that  told  the  story.  Johnson  won  the  set  at  6/i  and  had  earned  his 
bracket. 

Although  never  in  the  lead  Clothier  was  at  all  times  dangerous  against 
McLoughlin,  and  a  very  little  would  have  changed  the  course  of  the  match. 
Clothier  had  his  chance  in  the  first  set  when,  after  losing  his  first  service 
he  came  up  from  the  rear  and  got  to  p/all  by  breaking  through  McLoughlin 
ty  fine  placed  shots  that  had  plenty  of  speed;  and,  winning  his  own  service, 
he  got  to  40/15  on  the  Californian's  and  lacked  but  a  point  of  leading  at 
5/3.  This  critical  game  went  to  deuce  and  advantage;  and  McLoughlin, 
after  an  erring  fit,  jumped  in  to  save  it  and  finally  succeeded.  Service 
won  to  6/all,  when  Clothier  lapsed  into  errors  and  was  broken  Jihrough. 
McLoughlin  followed  it  up  by  the  win  of  his  own  service,  the  set  being  his 
at    8/6. 

The  second  set  was  all  McLoughlin's.  He  was  going  beautifully,  hitting 
hard  and  accurately  and  being  brimful  of  confidence.  He  won  Clothier's 
service  in  the  third  and  seventh  games  and  won  the  set  at  6/2.  The 
pendulum  swung  in  the  other  direction  in  the  third  set,  although 
McLoughlin  started  by  breaking  through  Clothier  in  the  first  game.  At  3/2 
McLoughlin,  Clothier  made  his  effort  and  by  speeding  up  and  hitting  accu- 
rately he  won  his  opponent's  service.  Some  of  his  gets  of  difficult  shots 
and  return  of  them  for  the  kill  were  very  fine  indeed.  He  became  more 
aggressive  in  the  seventh  game,  going  to  the  net  consistently  and  there 
volleying  severely  and  accurately.  In  the  eighth  game  he  broke  through 
again,  McLoughlin  slumping  badly  and  missing  many  easy  shots.  The  set 
was  Clothier's  on  his  own  service  at  6/3.  Again  in  the  fourth  set  Clothier 
got  within  reaching  distance  of  victory.  Services  were  exchanged  in  the 
second  and  third  games,  and  Clothier  drew  even  at  4/all,  after  a  hard- 
fought  game.^  By  good  court  covering  and  hard  hitting  Clothier  led  at 
40/0  on  McLoughlin's  service.  This  game  was  the  thriller  and  the  crucial 
one  of  the  match.  At  advantage  Clothier  netted  the  service  and  thereafter 
he  never  got  the  lead;  there  followed  a  succession  of  drives,  volleys  and 
lobs,  each  man  striving  desperately  and  making  the  most  marvellous  gets. 
Finally  McLoughlin,  at  the  net,  got  a  short  one  and  dispatched  it  clearly; 
he  followed  it  with  a  speedy  drive  to  Clothier's  right  corner  and  the  latter, 
anticipating  it,  missed  it  by  inches,  the  game  being  McLoughlin's  and  the 
score  5/4.  Two  errors  by  Clothier  made  him  0/30,  and  the  end  came  a 
little  later  when  the   Philadelphian  volleyed  out. 

Clothier's  many  errors  undoubtedly  lost  him  the  match,  but  they  were 
errors  due  chiefly  to  his  remarkable  gets  of  what  would  otherwise  have 
been  aces  for  McLoughlin.  It  was  good  tennis,  and  Clothier  played  better 
than  at  any  time  this  year  and  perhaps  as  well  as  at  any  time  in  his 
career.  McLoughlin  was  at,  or  almost  at,  his  best,  and  he  had  but  little 
margin. 

Monday  morning,  August  26,  when  a  new  champion  was  to  be  made, 
dawned  cloudy  and  just  a  little  sticky.  The  grand  stands  were  a  little 
more  than  half  full  when  McLoughlin  and  Johnson  appeared  and  began 
their  knock-up.  Long  before  the  first  set  was  finished,  however,  the  stands 
were  full,  and  every  point  from  where  a  glimpse  of  the  court  could  be 
seen    was   seized  by   eager    spectators. 

Johnson  began  the  service,  and  McLoughlin  netted  the  return  of  John- 
son's side  line  drive,  and  followed  this  by  driving  out  three  successive 
shots.  McLoughlin  fulfilled  expectations  in  the  next  game,  going  to  the 
net  for  the  kill  and  acing  Johnson  on  the  service.  He  stayed  back  in 
the  third  game,  however,  and  Johnson  proved  his  superior  at  driving  from 
that  point.  Service  won  to  4/3.  Johnson  leading,  the  latter  passing 
McLoughlin  whenever  he  came  to  the  net.  This  shook  the  latter's  confi- 
dence and  he  erred  badly  in  the  eighth  game,  losing  his  own  service  on 
nets    and    outs   of  easy    balls.      Johnson    led   in   40/15    for   the   set    game   but 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  11 

missed    two    difficult    shots    at   the    net;    then    McLoughlin    erred    twice    and 
the  set  was  Johnson's  at  6/3. 

McLoughlin's  trouble  was  lack  of  confidence  when  he  found  he  was  not 
stroking  well,  and  he  made  the  mistake  of  playing  carefully  and  stayimg 
back,  when  his  only  chance  was  to  go  to  the  net.  Johnson  was  cool  and 
very  accurate  and  his  win  of  the  set  was  clearly  earned. 

Much  worse  was  to  come.  McLoughlin  began  the  service  and  dropped 
the  first  game,  hitting  the  ball  all  over  the  lot.  Johnson  won  his  own 
service  and  had  McLoughlin  eating  out  of  his  hand;  the  latter  stayed  back 
and  chased  Johnson's  sliding  chops,  with  very  little  success;  the  Cali- 
fornian  seemed  to  be  on  the  verge  of  complete  demoralization.  At  30/40 
in  the  third  game  McLoughlin  had  a  "sitter"  and  promptly  smashed  it 
into  the  net,  making  the  score  3/0.  McLoughlin  then  led  at  40/15  on 
Johnson's  service  but  erred  repeatedly;  deuce  and  vantage  were  called 
several  times,  but  two  wild  shots  by  the  Cajifornian  ended  the  game  and 
the,  score  was  4/0.  A  hush  descended  upon  the  gallery  and  people  looked 
at  ^ach  other  in  amazement  and  general  consternation  prevailed.  A  flicker 
of  hope  came  when  McLoughlin  took  advantage  of  Johnson's  lapses  and 
won  the  fifth  game;  but  the  Philadelphian  won  a  deuce  game,  outsteadying 
his  opponent,  who  seemed  glued  to  the  back  of  the  court.  Johnson  was  at 
his  best  in  the  seventh  game.  He  played  with  confidence,  coming  to  the 
net  and  volleying  finely,  getting  to  40/0  in  this  manner;  he  then  cleverly 
drew  "Mac"  to  one  side  and  chopped  to  the  other  one  for  the  set  point 
while   the   auburn-haired    youth    stood    and   watched   it   hit   the   line. 

An  abyss  yawned  before  the  favorite  and  scattering  applause  for  John- 
son was  the  only  thing  to  break  the  silence.  A  tragedy  was  imminent,  a 
stupendous  and  amazing  upset  seemed  at  hand.  Two  sets  to  love  was  bad 
enough,  but  McLoughlin's  utter  inability  to  cope  with  his  opponent  was 
the    non-understandable    thing. 

The  hopes  of  the  McLoughlin  adherents  revived  when  he  won  his  own 
servi'ce  and  then  broke  through  Johnson's.  It  was  due  more  to  Johnson's 
lapse  than  to  any  coming  on  of  McLoughlin's.  and  when  the  latter  began 
to  err  also  he  lost  the  third  game  at  love  on  his  own  delivery,  going  com- 
pletely up  in  the  air  and  making  mistakes  that  were  little  short  of  idiotic. 
In  the  fourth  game  he  came  up  on  weak  returns  and  was  passed  cleanly 
and  inevitably.  It  was  really  pitiable.  McLoughlin  rallied  in  the  fifth, 
and,  working  desperately,  won  it,  leading  at  z/2.  This  was  the  turning 
point  for,  after  many  close  calls,  he  got  to  5/2;  then  he  drove  three  balls 
out  in  succession  and  dropped  a  game.  He  won  his  own  service  at  love 
and  the  set  was  his  at  6/3  and  he  had  a  breathing  spell  in  which  to  pull 
himself   together. 

McLoughlin  started  badly  in  the  fourth  set,  losing  both  Johnson  s  and 
his  own  service.  Again  McLoughlin  puUed  himself  together  and  got  to 
2/all,  aided  by  Johnson's  errors.  The  latter  then  won  his  own  service, 
running  McLoughlin  over  the  court  after  prettily  placed  side  line  shots. 
A  momentary  recovery  by  McLoughlin  evened  the  score  again,  and  then 
he  once  more  began  to  pat  the  ball  back,  missing  numerous  chances  to  kill 
outright  and  losing  the  seventh  game.  Johnsoii  was  feeling  the  strain  of 
the  first  two  sets,  as  otherwise  he  could  have  driven  home  his  advantage 
without  the  slightest  trouble.  Again  McLoughlin  evened  it  at  4/all.  The 
all-important  ninth  game  went  to  McLoughlin  after  a  sharp  struggle,  the 
two  last  points  being  lucky  for  him;  one  of  them  was  a  net  for  Johnson, 
the  ball  just  failing  to  roll  over;  the  next  was  a  net  cord  stroke  for 
McLoughlin,  the  ball  dancing  a  jig  on  the  canvas  and  finally  dropping 
over.  McLoughlin  won  his  service  and  the  set  was  his  at  6/4  and  the 
sets  2/all. 

Johnson's  championship  chances  virtually  ended  with  the  net  cord  stroke 
referred  to  above;  it  shook  his  iron  nerve,  and  the  strain  of  the  match  was 
telling  heavily  on  him.  McLoughlin  won  five  games  in  succession,  gaining 
confidence  with  each,  while  Johnson's  star  waned  steadily  as  he  made  error 
after  error   on   shots   that  would    have  been   easy  earlier   in   the   match.     In 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  13 

tlie  sixth  game,  however,  with  McLoughlin  serving,  Johnson  saved  himself 
from  a  love  set.  At  30/all  the  Californian  had  an  easy  smash  but  sent  it 
away  out;  he  followed  it  with  a  fine  drive  down  the  line  which  made  the 
chalk  fly.  The  Philadelphian  then  won  his  own  service  after  a  long  deuce 
game  full  of  errors.  It  was  his  last  game,  however,  as  McLoughlin  won 
the   next   one   entirely   on  Johnson's  errors. 

As  long  as  Johnson's  wonderful  streak,  with  its  deadly  passing  shots, 
lasted  he  was  invincible,  but  chiefly  because  McLoughlin  did  not  play  his 
usual  game.  Instead  of  coming  in  fast  and  close  and  volleying  sharply  he 
.started  wildly  and  then  tried  to  play  carefully.  At  no  time  in  the  match 
did  he  play  within  15  of  the  form  displayed  consistently  by  him  during  the 
season.  On  this  day,  however,  Johnson  would  have  been  dangerous  to 
any  player.     The  summaries:

The  Doubles  Championship 

In  the  doubles  championship  the  victory  of  the  Californians  came  as  the 
reward  of^  four  years'  persistent  effort,  and  each  reached  the  championship 
■court  at  Newport  on  two  other  occasions.  In  1909  Hackett  and  Alexander 
were  challenged  by  McLoughlin  and  Janes,  the  latter  going  down  to  defeat, 
and  in  1910  Bundy  and  Hendricks  met  the  same  fate  at  the  hands  of  this 
■same  pair. 

The  defenders  were  clearly  the  superior  of  their  challengers  in  the  first 
?et.  In  the  following  two  sets  they  were  decidedly  off,  while  the  Califor- 
nians showed  marked  improvement.  In  the  first  half  of  the  fourth  set 
ancthe*-  shift   occurred  and  it  seemed  as  if  a  fifth   set  would  be  necessary. 


GU  STAVE  F.  TOUCHARD. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNDAL.  17 

but  a  rapid  fire  change  took,  place  and  the  challengers  drove  home  the 
victory   after   a  sharp    contest. 

Touchard  began  the  service  and  the  game  went  to  the  easterners  without 
a  point  being  earned  and  with  Little  the  only  player  not  to  make  a  mis- 
play.  The  second  game  went  the  same  way,  McLoughlin's  service  being 
broken  through,  a  nicely  placed  shot  of  Touchard's  between  the  opposing 
pair  and  Bundy's  drive  out  being  the  chief  factors.  Little  won  his  service, 
the  Californian  still  erring,  and  the  score  was  3/0.  A  struggle  ensued 
when  Bundy  began  serving.  At  40/15  Bundy  netted  Touchard's  sharp 
drive  to  his  feet,  and  netted  the  next  shot  also;  Bundy's  drive  through 
Little  helped,  and  then  Little  drove  the  service  out  and  the  score  was  3/1- 
Games   went   with   the  service   thereafter,    the   set   being  Little's  at   6/3. 

McLoughlin's  service  won  in  the  second  set  and  then  the  westerners 
missed  an  excellent  chance  to  break  through  Touchard.  They  led  at  40/30 
and  again  at  advantage,  but  erred;  back  and  forth  it  went  many  times, 
and  McLoughlin  finally  missed  two  in  succession  and  the  score  was  i-alL 
In  the  sixth  game  Touchard  was  broken  through  on  earned  shots  and  the 
score  was  4/2.  Bundy  served  out  the  next  and  then  the  westerners  began 
a  lobbing  attack   during   Little's  service  and   won   the   game   and   set,   6/2. 

Bundy  was  the  star  in  this  set,  getting  into  nearly  every  play,  smashing 
and  driving  into  the  opening  and  scoring  point  after  point.  All  four  men 
made  errors,  and  only  Little  was  uniformly  severe;  and  he  hit  many  balls 
out,   some  of  them  by  very  wide  margins. 

McLoughlin's  service  was  broken  through  to  start  with,  and  then  Tou- 
chard was  treated  in  a  similar  manner;  both  games  were  long  deuce  affairs, 
however.  Bundy's  service  won  the  third  game,  his  opponents  being  unable 
to  do  anything  with  it.  Errors  lost  the  fourth  game,  Little  serving;  and 
Touchard  did  no  better  in  the  sixth.  Bundy  again  served  out,  in  the  sev- 
enth game,  winning  the  set  at  6/1  and  leading  2  sets  to  i.  The  challengers 
were  clearly   the  superiors,  but  the  tennis  was  still  anything  but  high   class. 

The  defenders  jumped  into  the  lead  at  3/1,  the  fourth  game  being  the 
win  of  McLoughlin's  service,  chiefly  through  tlie  latter's  errors.  The  com- 
plection  of  affairs  had  changed  quickly  and  the  westerners  were  losing 
ground  by  the  minute.  Little  served  the  next  game  and  got  to  40/0.  It 
probably  meant  the  win  of  the  set,  but  a  catastrophe  occurred;  in  his 
anxiety,  doubtless,  Little  over-hit  and  his  shots  went  miles  out;  deuce  was 
reached  and  then  game,  the  score  being  3/2.  Bundy's  win  of  ser- 
vice followed  on  Little's  errors.  The  defenders  got  still  another  chance, 
winning  the  seventh  game  on  Touchard's  delivery;  then  they  led  at  30/15 
on  McLoughlin's  service;  but  errors  let  the  Calif ornians  get  to  3o-all  and 
then  came  the  great  rally  and  play  of  the  match.  All  four  men  got  to  the 
net  and  the  ball  flew  back  and  forth,  one  lightning  shot  following  another; 
twice  Little  and  Touchard  had  the  chance  to  kill,  the  ball  coming  high  to 
them,  but  they  only  tapped  it;  finally  inspiration  seized  McLoughlin  and 
he  tossed  one.  The  ball  dropped  in  the  opposing  side's  left  corner,  and 
both  ran  back  for  it.  Little  got  the  nearest,  but  missed  it.  Placed  shots 
and  errors  on  easy  shots  almost  lost  Little's  service,  but  it  was  finally 
pulled  out,  and  they  led  at  5/4.  Bundy  won  his  own  service,  and  then 
Touchard  was  broken  through,  McLoughlin  getting  the  points  with  hard, 
well  placed  drives,  and  his  side  leading  at  6/5.  The  twelfth  game  was  won 
on  shots  to  the  alley  and  Little's  lob  out  for   the  final   point. 

McLoughlin  came  strong  at  the  end  of  this  set,  but  on  the  whole  his 
game  was  less  effective  than  Bundy's.  The  latter  drove  rather  weakly  and 
was  occasionally  caught  napping;  but  his  were  the  deadly  and  dangerous 
shots.  Touchard  was  never  severe,  but  otherwise  his  game  was  excellent 
and  he  was  as  quick  to  see  holes  as  Bundy.  Little  was  .Speedy  and  aggres- 
sive throughout,  but  he  hit  entirely  too  many  cut,  lacking  control.  The 
summary: 

Challenge  round-^Thomas  C.  Bu-ndy  of  Los  Angeles  ?,nd  Maurice  E. 
McLoughlin  of  San  Francisco,  Cal  (challengers),  defeased  Raymond  D. 
Little  and  Gustave  F.  Touchard  cf  New  York   (holders),  3/6,  6/2,  6/1,  7/5. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  19 


National  Preliminary  Doubles 

Before  one  of  the  largest  crowds  in  the  history  of  Western  tennis, 
William  J.  Clothier  and  G.  P.  Gardner,  Jr.,  Eastern  doubles  champions, 
went  down  to  defeat  at  the  hands  of  Walter  T.  Hayes  and  James  H. 
Winston  of  Chicago,  Western  doubles  champions,  in  the  National  Pre- 
liminary Doubles  between  the  East,  West,  South  and  Pacific  States,  on  the 
courts  of  the  Onwentsia  Club  of  Lake  Forest,  111.,  July  30,  the  tournament 
concluding  on  the  following  day. 

Clothier,  serving  first,  quickly  took  the  first  game.  The  second  game  was 
•close  and  hard  fought,  the  Western  champions  winning  chiefly  through  the 
unsteadiness  of  the  Eastern  players.  At  the  beginning  of  the  final  set  it 
was  apparent  that  the  pace  of  the  earlier  m.atches  was  beginning  to  show 
its  effect  on  each  of  the  four  men,  all  showing  signs  of  tiring,  Winston 
being  particularly  exhausted.  Clothier,  however,  double-faulted  on  the  first 
point,  and  by  means  of  two  placed  returns  and  a  net  by  Gardner  the  West 
won  the  initial  game.  Then  followed  two  games  for  the  West,  Gardner 
losing  his  service.  With  the  score  3/1  against  them  Clothier  took  his  own 
serve,  a  love  game.  The  next  four  alternated,  each  man  winning  his  serve. 
Then,  with  the  score  5/4  in  favor  of  the  Western  men — Winston  serving — 
followed  the  longest  game  of  the  tournament,  twenty-two  points  being 
necessary  before  the  final  one  came.  It  was  Winston  who  finally  drove 
home  the  winning  point,  and  with  it  the  match,  6/4,   5/7,  8/10,  6/4,  6/4. 

While  the  East-West  battle  was  still  in  progress  Thomas  C.  Bundy  and 
Maurice  E.  McLoughlin,  the  Pacific  Coast  champions,  began  their  match 
against  Carleton  Y.   Smith  and  Nat  Thornton,  the   Southern  title  holders. 

The  first  game  went  quickly  to  the  Southern  champions,  but  Bundy — 
serving  next,  evened  the  score  by  taking  the  second  game.  The  third — a 
deuce  game — again  went  to  the  Atlanta  players,  giving  them  a  lead  at  2/1. 
Then  followed  two  straight  service  aces  by  McLoughlin  which — together 
■with  two  clever  smashes  by  Bundy — gave  the  Pacific  Coast  men  the  fourth 
game.  From  this  point  on  McLoughlin  and  Bundy  literally  took  the  South- 
erners off  their  feet  and  almost  before  the  gallery  realized  what  had  taken 
place  captured  the  first  set  at  6/2. 

Continuing  their  streak,  the  Californians  took  the  first  four  games  of  the 
second  set  in  short  order,  playing  in  close  to  the  net  and  forming,  in  this 
position,  a  stone  wall  that  it  seemed  impossible  for  Smith  and  Thornton  to 
beat  back.  The  fifth  game — a  deuce  affair — went  to  the  Atlanta  players, 
but  the  next  two  were  easy  for  Bundy  and  McLoughlin,  the  latter  winning 
a  love  game  on  his  serve  by  means  of  three  cannon-like  aces,  and  taking 
the  set  at  6/1. 

The  third  set  was  almost  an  exact  duplicate  of  the  second,  McLoughlin 
and  Bundy  taking  the  first  four  games — dropping  the  fifth — and  winning 
the  next  two,  and  the  set  at  6/1.  The  match  itself  finished  in  the  time  it 
took  to  play  one  set  and  a  half  on  the  adjoining  court,  and  never  in  the 
West  did  two  players  present  such  a  whirlwind  attack  as  the  Pacific  Coast 
champions. 

This  brought  the  Pacific  Coast  against  the  West  in  the  finals  on  Wednes- 
day. From  the  start  of  the  match  it  was  seen  that  Bundy  and  McLoughlin 
were  destined  to  have  things  very  mvich  their  own  way.  McLoughlin, 
serving  first,  shot  in  four  of  his  thirteen-inch  shells  and  quickly  took  the 
first  game.  Then  came  a  love  game  for  the  Coast  men  on  Hayes'  service, 
a  one-point  game   for   them  on   Bundy's  and  another  on   Winston's. 

With  the  score  four-love  against  them  Hayes  and  Winston  braced  cori- 
siderably  in  the  fifth  game  and  fought  a  long  deuce  battle  which  the  Cali- 
fornians finally  won.  Then,  with  Hayes,  serving,  the  visitors  put  a  sudden 
finish  to  the  set  by  taking  the  sixth  game  and  the  initial  session  at  6/0.

In  the  second  set  Hayes  and  Winston  made  a  determined  stand,  and, 
after  Bundy  and  Winston  had  taken  their  own  services,  broke  through 
McLoughlin  for  the  lead  at  2/1.  The  Pacific  Coast  men  at  once  recipro- 
cated, however,  by  taking  Hayes'  service  and  tying  the  score  at  2-all. 
From  this  point  the  games  alternated  until  s-all  was  reached  when  Hayes 
again  lost  his  service,  Bundy  following  by  taking  his  own  and  the  set  at  7/5. 

The  third  set  began  with  a  terrific  service  ace  by  McLoughlin,  an  out,  a 
net  and  a  place  which  gave  the  Californians  the  lead.  The  next  three 
games  alternated,  each  man  winning  his  service  until  2-all  was  reached. 
Then  followed  a  magnificent  spurt  by  the  Californians,  who  took  three 
games  and  the  lead  at  5/2.  The  eighth  was  easy  for  Hayes  and  Winston, 
McLoughlin  and  Bundy  netting  on  their  returns.  That,  however,  was  the 
last  flash  in  the  pan,  for  the  Pacific  Coast  champions  quickly  ran  out  the 
ninth  game  and  with   it   the  set  at  6/3. 

Throughout  the  match  Bundy  and  McLoughlin  demonstrated  that  they 
are  without  question  fifty  per  cent,  stronger  than  when  they  met  Touchard 
and  Little  a  year  ago  in  the  heart-breaking  five-set  match  that  decided  the 
issue  on  that  occasion.  Their  team  work  is  still  not  all  to  be  desired,  but 
even  in  this  department  they  have  improved  vastly  over  their  last  year's 
form.  Their  net  work,  however,  was  easily  the  best  ever  seen  in  the  West, 
and  they  presented  a  stonewall  defense  fully  the  equal  of  Hackett  and 
Alexander's  in  the  latter's  palmy  days.  It  was  simply  impossible  to  pass 
them  and   that — in   tennis — is   saying  a  good   deal.      The  summaries:

SrALDINGS    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  21 


Davis  Cup  Final 

By  "Austrai,"  of  "The  Referee,"  Sydney,   Australia. 

It  was  over,  and  the  unbeatable  Brookes,  the  invincible  volleyer,  was 
defeated,  and  defeated  by  a  mere  baseline  player,  whose  game  and  meth- 
ods were  as  open  as  the  day.  What  then  of  our  beliefs?  What  of  our 
hopes?  if  that  be  the  word  to  express  an  assured  and  it  seemed  j  jstiliable 
conviction  of  his  success.  They  were  shattered;  and  what  was  the 
explanation? 

That  was  the  question  put  to  me  by  dozens  in  the  interval  between  that 
rubber  and  the  second,  in  which,  we  hoped,  against  the  conviction  born  of 
pessimism,  that  Heath  might  defeat  Dixon.  I  answered,  perhaps  churlishly, 
"Who  am  I  to  offer  up  explaf  ations?  Am  I  a  weathercock  to  have 
explanations  ready  to  suit  every  turn  of  the  wind?"  Plainly,  I  could  not 
solve  the  enigma.  Time  and  again,  and  ceaselessly,  Brookes  was  planting 
the  ball  on  Parke's  back-hand,  and  each  time  Parke  hit  it  back  in  the 
same  way. 

Incomparable  drives  they  were  indeed,  of  great  pace,  sharply  across 
court,  and  diving  like  a  seahawk  as  they  crossed  the  net,  but  there  was  no 
variation  in  them.  Brookes  reached  them  all  right  and  should  have  vol- 
leyed  them,    but   did    not.      Why? 

Was  there  something  in  them  that  we  couldn't  perceive?  The  truth  is, 
of  course,  that  the  defeat  touched  us  too  nearly  for  oar  opinions  then  and 
there  to  have  much  value,  but  time  heals  all  things,  even  one's  judgment, 
and  luckily  I  have  the  material  preserved,  on  which  to  base  that  judg- 
ment, in  shorthand  notes,  taken  on  the  instant  conclusion  of  each  rally,  of 
my  opinion  of  the  merits  or  errors  of  each.  It  is  on  that  cold-blooded 
analysis  that  this  article  is  based.  They  are  negatives  of  mental  photo- 
graphs, and  the  camera  can't  lie;  at  least,  let  us  hope  not,  and  if,  in 
thinking  that  the  win  is  not  a  true  indication  of  the  relative  merits  of  the 
two  players,  I  am  showing  that  I  am  still  tinged  with  the  feelings  of  a 
partisan,   I    think    I   shall    err   in  good   company. 

Just  as  truly  as  the  globe-trotting  tennis  player,  Dr.  Graves,  who  saw 
the  contest,  and  saw  his  pupil,  Brookes,  defeated,  said  that  Brookes  was 
off  color  through  the  peculiar  oppressiveness  of  the  day,  so  was  Parke 
above  any  form  he  has  ever  displayed.  That  was  the  opinion  of  Dr. 
Graves,   of   Dixon,  and  of  Parke   himself. 

Ordinarily  he  is  favored,  as  all  hard  hitters  are,  by  slow  courts  and 
heavy,  dam.p  balls,  but  on  this  occasion  the  courts  were  as  hard  as  nails, 
and  the  sudden  accession  of  form  is  more  naturally  explained  by  his  state- 
ment that  never  before  had  he  better,  steady  practice  than  from  players 
to  whom  he  owes  forty,  while  out  here  he  had  five  weeks  or  more  of 
daily   practice   against   the   world's    best    class. 

This,  and  the  rising  of  a  great  athlete  to  a  great  occasion,  is  the  truer 
explanation  of  his  sudden  rise  to  the  ability  to  drive  harder  and  more 
truly  than  any  player  I  have  ever  seen.  Sixteen  times  he  has  played  ia 
Rugby  foot  ball  for  Ireland  and  three  times  he  has  been  captain.  Tough, 
and  wiry,  fleet-footed  as  a  hare,  and  cf  a  disposition  that  revels  in  diffi- 
culties and  keeps  him  ever  laughing,  and  as  keen  to  admire  his  oppo- 
nent's  success  as  his   own,   he   is  the   ideal    sportsman. 

That  was  the  first  rubber,  and  rur  fondest  hopes  were  dashed  to  the 
ground.  True,  Dixon  had  so  distilkd  his  own  form  that  the  day  before 
he  nominated  Beamish  as  the  other  singles  player,  and  Heath  was  reputed 
to  be  in  good  form,  although  the  continual  rains  had  prevented  one  judg- 
ing  his   form   with   any   certaintv- 

But  Dixon  was  fresh  from  his  victories  in  England  in  the  preliminary 
round    over   Gobert   and    Decugis,'  the    French    cham.pions,    and    not   even    his 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  23 

three  sets  to  one  defeat  in  the  Victorian  championships  by  Horace  Rice 
could    remove    the    impression    of    his    abilities. 

But  if  ever  an  opportunity  was  missed  it  was  in  that  second  rubber. 
Dixon  was  a  pure  gift.  Rice,  or  A.  B.  Jones,  or  half  a  dozen  men 
could  have  defeated  Dixon  on  the  day's  showing,  and  Heath  himself  had 
little  difficulty  in  taking  the  first  set.  Then  he  seemed  to  sit  back  as  if 
:.to  say:  "I  have  made  a  good  showing;  that  is  enough."  He  had  no 
finishing  capacity  mentally,  or  else  he  was  entirely  out  of  condition,  and 
if  the  latter  it  is  inexcusable. 

Each  time  he  got  level  in  the  next  three  sets  he  rested  on  his  oars  and 
watched  Dixon  go  out.  The  rallies  were  feeble  back-hand  to  back-hand 
interchanges,  and  seldom  did  Heath  go  for  his  forehand  deep  drives,  save 
to   get   level,   and  then    to    rest   again — I    almost    said    sleep. 

To  all  watching  so  ended  the  struggle.  Brookes  and  Dunlop  would 
win  the  doubles  and  Brookes  would  defeat  Dixon,  but  then  would  come 
the    massacre   of    Heath    by    Parke.      Actually    it   did    not. 

Heath  made  quite  a  fine  fight  with  Parke,  but  here  again  was  content 
to  get  level,  and  would  persist  on  going  to  the  net  to  be  passed  hopelessly 
by    Parke's   perfect   drives.      "Both    back,"    Heath    held    his   own. 

In  the  doubles  our  hopes  were  more  than  justified.  Actually  the  match 
was  not  of  the  highest  class.  Parke  and  Beamish  do  not  make  a  strong 
pair.       They    lack    in    team    work. 

But  they  were  up  against  Dunlop  in  his  highest  vein.  Freddie  Alex- 
ander in  1908  expressed  his  opinion  to  me  without  hesitation, — and  what 
better  judge  could  there  be  than  the  best  doubles  player  in  the  world  at 
the  time? — that  Dunlop  was  one  of  the  three  best  doubles  players  in 
the    world. 

The  team  work  of  the  Australasian  pair  was  like  a  machine,  and  Dun- 
lop's    tossing     scored    continually. 

Brookes  disposed  of  Dixon  comfortably  enough,  and  was  something 
near  his  form,  but  was  still  making  the  unusual  errors  which  he  showed 
against  Parke.  In  the  third  set  Dixon  played  finely,  and  one  feared 
somewhat  that  if  he  rose  a  bit  higher  he  would  take  the  set  and  possibly 
win  the  match.  The  pressure  on  him  was  a  shade  too  heavy,  and-  he 
broke  in  the  last  two  games,  leaving  the  matches  even  at  2-all  and 
Australians  leading  on  sets  and  games.  But  the  match,  Parke  vs.  Heath, 
was   to   follow,   and   hope   told  a    dismal   tale  to   Australians. 

The  effect  on  the  game  itself  is  as  I  foreshadowed,  good  in  two  aspects, 
first,  the  backcourt  game  is  restored  to  something  of  its  old  standing, 
and,  as  I  shall  show  later,  cannot  be  said  to  be  able  t9  live  alone.  The 
result  of  Parke's  win  has  been  to  clearly  establish  this,  that  the  whole 
game  of  good  driving  and  good  volleying  should  succeed  against  either 
of   the    branches    alone,    even   if    Brookes    be    at    the    net. 

■  I  do  not  wish  to  be  misunderstood  in  this.  Brookes  is  not  a  volleyer 
alone.  I  know  that  his  forehand  drive  is  quite  the  most  severe  I  have 
ever  seen.  I  welcomed  him  in  1896  as  a  coming  champion.  If  he  chose 
he  could  at  least  hold  his  own — as  he  used  to  do — almost  wholly  at  the 
back  of  the  court.  Moreover,  his  ability  to  play  the  rising  ball,  as  I 
clearly  point  out  in  "Lawn  Tennis  in  Australasia,"  is  derived  from  his 
ground  strokes,  and  this  ability  used  in  taking  even  McLoughlin's  services 
from  two  yards  inside  the  base  line,  is  half  of  the  secret  of  his  pre- 
eminence, and  is  quite  as  important  as  his  service  and  his  volleying. 
You    Americans    know    how    R.    N.    Williams    scores   by    it. 

But  Brookes  is  content  to  get  to  the  net  anyhow,  and  latterly  does  not 
try  for  great  pace  on  his  volleys.  He  has  found,  usually,  that  this 
position  once  gained,  he  can  anticipate  and  meet  the  next  shot.  It  was 
well,  therefore,  that  he  should  get  the  lesson,  and  well  for  him  and 
well   for    the   game. 

The  crowd  was  an  immense  one.  It  included  the  Governor  General  of 
Australia,    the  Governor    of    Victoria,   and    their    ladies    and    suites,    and   ail

the  notable  players  and  enthusiasts  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  It 
increased  each  day,  and  on  Saturday — the  last  day — there  were  over  7,000 
people  surrounding  the  court  and  over  1,000  were  turned  away.  It 
certainly  was  the  greatest  crowd  that  ever  paid  to  see  a  match.  The 
estimated  10,000  spectators,  who  in  America  in  1902  assembled  to  watch 
the  Dohertys,  were  non  paying,  and  as  the  stands  were  not  extensive  it 
is    hard   to    believe    that    10,000   people    could    watch    the    game. 

At  any  rate  it  was  a  fine  sight,  and  across  the  sea  of  faces  a  ripple  of 
content  spread  as  Brookes  scored  his  opening  games  against  Parke.  The 
entire  crowd  expected  him  to  win,  and  his  usual  runaway  opening  was 
very  pleasing.  Three  games  to  three  strokes  (and  one  of  these  hit  out 
deliberately  to  restore  an  umpire's  error).  It  looked  too  easy,  and  one 
was  quite  sorry  for  Parke,  and  was  quite  pleased  to  see  him  secure  the 
third    game    on    his   own    services. 

Even  at  this  stage,  however,  easily  as  Brookes  was  winning,  I  debited 
him  with  distinct  errors,  and  said  in  my  notes,  "Brookes  is  mulling,  (i.  e., 
not  scoring  cleanly  off)  easy  strokes."  That  from  him  in  these  contests  is 
absolutely     unusual. 

In  the  next  game  the  battle  waged  furiously.  Parke  commenced  to 
feel  his  way  and,  going  for  lightning  drives,  got  past  Brookes.  He  had 
to  stand  three  feet  behind  the  base  line  to  take  Brookes'  service,  while 
Brookes    was    almost    as    many    yards    inside    when    receiving. 

On  his  return  or  on  his  service  Parke  stayed  back  almost  wholly,  wisely 
judging  that  as  a  volleyer  against  Brookes  he  could  not  hold  his  own. 
Brookes  sent  his  return  of  service  deep  down  the  center,  and  chased 
speedily  on  after  it,  gaining  the  net  each  time  and  his  favorite  position. 
Then,  time  and  again,  as  he  put  it  to  me,  he  got  to  the  ball,  and  missed 
or  mulled  it,  and  a  mull  was  as  bad  as  a  clean  miss,  for  next  stroke  saw 
Parke  race  in  and  take  the  ball  on  his  forehand,  and,  in  his  full  stride, 
struck  with  machine-like  accuracy  on  either  side,  scoring  ace  after  ace 
clean,  for  he  gave  not  the  slightest  indication  as  to  which  side  he  would 
choose — even  to  us  onlookers.  Many  Brookes  could  have  volleyed,  but 
let  go,  only  to  see  them  fall  just  in,  and  indeed  it  seemed  as  if  there 
■were   an    invisible    barrier    that    prevented    the    ball    passing    the    lines. 

After  4/1  in  Brookes'  favor  he  could  not  withstand  this  human  gatling- 
gun,  or  pompom.  After  4-all  Brookes  again  took  the  lead  at  5/4  and 
-went  to  3-love  against  Parke's  service.  The  crowd  was  comforted,  but 
personally  I  saw  his  defeat  coming,  for  the  player  who  can  hold  Brookes 
at   first    will    do    better    later,    if    he    has    sufficient    staying    power. 

At  love-30  Parke  scored  a  long,  dra-wn-out  rally,  mixing  his  pace  finely; 
30-all.  Brookes  followed  in  a  weak  return  and  was  promptly  passed. 
After  one  "deuce"  Parke  scored  5-all.  Brookes  took  his  service  to  15 
and    Parke    the    twelfth    to    30. 

Parke  led,  7/6,  and  opened  with  a  double  fault  but  took  the  game 
after    30/40,    mainly    by    good    passes,    and    the    first    set. 

The  features  of  Parke's  play  were:  first,  his  severe  backhand  cross- 
court  drives,  which  were  untouched  by  Brookes  as  they  dived  quickly 
after  crossing  the  net;  second,  the  precision  with  which,  having  completed 
a  weak  volley,  he  raced  in  and  finished  with  a  forehand  drive.  His 
backhand  strokes  never  went  "down  the  alley,"  but  his  forehand  went 
where  he  wished.  He  never  tossed,  and  Brookes  failed  to  see  this  and 
to  press  in  more  closely  to  the  net. 

Brookes  took  the  opening  game  of  the  second  set  by  working  closer  in 
to  the  net,  but  lost  the  next  two  games,  his  errors  increasing.  Parke 
scored    the    third    game    to    love,    purely    by    drives. 

Again  Parke  scored  by  perfect  driving,  defeating  Brookes  by  his  speed 
of  stroke.  Brookes  took  Parke's  next  service  to  love  by  more  pressing 
volleying,  and  one  hoped  that  at  last  he  was  asserting  himself,  for  he 
got  to  40/15,  but  Parke's  returns  got  to  his  toes  and  he  netted  his  low 
volleys  or  half-volleys,  and  missed  an  easy  high  volley.  At  4/2  Brookes 
won    his   own    service,    but    he    punctuated    the   next   game    with    errors,    and

Parke  notched  it,  and  led,  5/3.  He  led  30-Iove  against  Brookes'  service, 
and  though    Brookes  pressed    he   scored   the  game  and  the  second   set. 

Brookes  changed  his  cloth  cap  for  a  white  one,  owing  to  the  intense 
heat,  but  his  game  got  worse,  and  Parke  got  better,  and  the  latter,  by 
perfect    driving,    compelled    Brookes    into   errors,   and    led,    5/1. 

But  right  here  Parke  himself  faltered.  He  saw  the  victory  and  it 
dazzled  him.  Brookes,  on  the  other  hand,  braced  mightily  and  Parke's 
best  lead  was  30/15  i"  one  game  up  to  5/6,  when  he  led  40/30;  but  here 
Brookes  scored  three  fine  services  and  the  third  set  by  sending  the  ball 
frequently    to    Parke's    exposed    forehand,    taking    his    opponent    by    surprise. 

The  fourth  set  commenced  just  short  of  100  minutes  from  the  opening 
stroke,  and  Parke  took  the  first  game,  Brookes'  returns  being  slack.  Parke 
then  led  at  40-love  against  Brookes'  service.  A  great  struggle  ensued 
after  Brookes  had  taken  four  points  in  succession.  There  were  eight 
deuces. 

Again  Parke  took  his  service,  and  Brookes  evened  by  fine,  severe 
volleying,  but  missed  two  easy  strokes.  Parke  took  the  next  game  to 
love,  serving  well  and  scoring  by  lightning  drives.  He  took  Brookes' 
next  services  by  more  perfect  baseline  play,  either  besting  Brookes  or 
passing  him  clean,  and  Parke  led,  4/2.  He  served  and  scored  to  love. 
Brookes  was  caught  once  or  twice  in  two  minds,  whether  he  would 
chase  in  on  his  return  or  stay  back,  but  he  had  the  question  settled  for 
him  by  Parke's  perfect  drives.  Brookes  served  at  2/5,  and  there  was 
still  a  hope  that,  as  in  the  last  set,  the  champion  would  snatch  victory 
from  the  jaws  of  his  opponent.  He  scored  the  first  point  by  a  fine  volley, 
but  was  twice  passed  by  clean  drives.  Closing  in  he  forced  Parke  to 
toss  out.  The  next  return  was  short  and  hard  to  his  feet,  and  he  half 
volleyed  into  the  net,  30/40  and  match  point  for  Parke. r  Brookes  volleyed 
Parke's  next  return  for  a  clean  ace.  A  fast  rally  ensued  and  Parke 
volleyed  a  ball,  "going  out"  into  the  net.  \^antage  to  Brookes.  Parke 
scored  again  by  a  chalk-raising  drive,  and  Brookes  volleyed  the  next 
return    out,    evidently    wearied.      Another   match    point    for    Parke. 

Brookes  served  and  followed  right  in,  and  after  a  rally  (he  closed  in) 
volleyed  a  fine  drive  severely  to  the  left  line,  and  Parke  seemed  defeated 
as  he  was  way  over  on  the  other  side,  but  coming  at  express  speed. 
Just  as  the  ball  hung  clear  of  the  second  hop  he  swung  as  he  ran  and  a 
perfect  backhand  went  sailing  for  the  net.  Astonished  and  perhaps  off 
his  feet  Brookes  watched  it  cross  the  net  and  dive  like  a  hawk  for  the 
ground,    and    land    sharply    across    court,    and    well   inside    the    service    line. 

He  watched  it  and  slowly  his  face  broke  into  a  perfect  smile  of  con- 
gratulation to  his  opponent,  a  smile  quite  as  whole-hearted  as  that  with 
which  at  Christchurch  he  greeted  the  congratulations  of  his  admirers  as 
they    thronged    around    him    after    his    success. 

He  set  the  keynote  for  the  crowd,  though  they  needed  no  such  setting, 
for  the  victory  was  received  in  the  way  that  in  1908  caused  Beals  Wright 
to  say  to  Alexander:  "Why,  Freddie,  you  would  think  they  wanted  us 
to    win." 

That  is  where  Australia  scored  and  out  of  defeat  snatched  a  moral 
victory.  Just  as  well  did  Parke  take  his  win.  In  the  dressing  room  five 
minutes   later    I    said:      "By   Jove,    that   was  a   humming   backhand!" 

"Oh!    but   what  a   fluke!"   he    replied,   laughing  heartily. 

It  was  not  that.  It  was  the  never-say-die  attempt  of  a  born  fighter 
who,    like    the   New   Zealand    warriors,    "fights   on    forever    and    ever." 

Can  Heath  save  us?  was  the  next  question.  Dixon  is,  on  his  own 
showing,  ofif  his  game.  Can  the  man  who  defeated  Larned  repeat  his 
previous  win  over  Dixon,  seeing  that  the  English  crack  is  off?  It  was 
a    chance.      Could    Heath    rise    to    the    occasion?      He    failed    dismally. 

In  the  opening  set  Dixon,  in  spite  of  double  faults,  took  the  first 
game,  and  in  the  second  Heath  scored.  Then  commenced  a  duel  of  back- 
hand to  backhand,  much  the  same  as  between  Heath  and  Larned  at 
Christchurch.  But  Dixon's  backhand  has  immense  "drag"  and  is  a 
difficult   ball    to   handle.     Heath's   is   plain   and   easy.

Up  to  2-all  the  length  of  each  was  poor  and  Heath  tried  to  do 
too  much  with  Dixon's  good  services.  He  would  not  defend  at  all. 
It  was  slam,  slump,  hit  or  miss.  Heath  led  at  z/^,  but  3/all,  4/3,  and 
5/3  were  called  as  Dixon  moved  up.  Dixon  was  serving  finely  and  his 
close  volleying  was  scoring  by  its  heavy  cut.  At  5/3  Dixon  served,  and 
led  30-love,  but  he  double-faulted  twice,  and  Heath,  under  the  pressure, 
dropped  onto  his  powerful  driving  and  scored  twice,  4/5.  But  the  play 
was  below  Davis  Cup  form;  15/40  was  called  next  game,  but  Heath 
spurted  and  drove  and  volleyed  in  fine  form  and  got  five-all,  after  two 
deuces.  He  took  Dixon's  next  service  decisively,  and  this  play  continued 
would  have  landed  the  goods.  Serving,  he  got  in  several  beauties  and 
scored  from  the  last  positions  gained  by  his  fine  volleying;  7/5  and  the 
first    set.      The    crowd    almost    hoped    and    cheered    encouragingly. 

Dixon  served  splendidly,  and  took  the  game  and  the  next  also.  Heath 
rested  on  his  oars.  He  took  the  third  game  but  lost  the  fourth;  3/1, 
3/2,  and  4/2  were  the  next  calls,  Dixon  holding  his  services  by  their 
severity,  and  by  his  continual  pressure  on  Heath's  backhand.  In  the 
sixth  game  he  scored  on  the  pure  merit  of  his  own  play.  Under  the 
pressure  Heath  again  improved  and  evened  at  four-all,  by  harder  driving, 
and  more  closely  connected  attacking  rallies.  There  was  method  in 
his    play. 

At  four-all  he  stacked  again  and  started  pushing  the  ball.  He  allowed 
Dixon  to  press  on  his  backhand.  He  made  the  mistake  of  assuming  that 
Dixon's  backhand  was  the  weaker.  So  it  is  a  fact  against  players  in 
general,  but  Heath  could  not  handle  it,  because  of  its  cut,  and  should 
therefore  have  avoided  the  chance  of  its  being  played.  Against  him  it 
was    stronger. 

The  third  set,  after  one  set-all,  was  a  repetition  of  the  second.  Dixon 
led  to  2/0  by  backhand  cross-court  duels.  Heath  again  spurted,  and 
evened  at  three-all,  after  1/3.  In  the  fifth  game  Heath  scored  by  going 
for  his  own  commanding  drives  to  Dixon's  forehand.  His  driving  was 
better  than  his  tactics,  and  in  the  sixth  game  also  he  drove  finely.  Each 
won  his  service  after  close  games.  At  deuce  in  the  ninth  game  a  lucky 
net  ball  gave  Dixon  a  point  when  defeated.  After  two  deuces  Dixon 
scored  and  led,  5/4.  Dixon  then  pressed,  sending  back  fine  returns, 
which  Heath  either  volleyed  weakly  to  be  finished  next  stroke,  or  they 
passed  him.  The  last  smash  he  let  go,  though  a  run  would  hava  reached 
it.      Two    sets    to    one. 

Two-love  was  again  called  in  the  next  set  in  Dixon's  favor.  Again 
Heath  was  up  and  doing  and  went  for  five  drives  and  scored  them.  He 
could  not  analyze  his  own  game  and  keep  to  this  winning  streak.  Two-all 
again.  Dixon  got  ahead  by  good  play,  and  led,  4/2.  He  played  his  best 
at  this  stage,  and  won  more  largely  on  his  own  merit  of  strokes  and 
tactics. 

He  was  palpably  on  a  finishing  effort  and  stalled  off  Heath's  usual 
recovery,  leading,  5/2.  Heath,  however,  still  had  a  kick  in  him,  and 
he    landed   the    next    game    by    fine   driving   and    volleying,    5/3. 

Dixon  served  and  worked  his  "second"  freely.  He  smashed  a  weak 
return,  was  beaten  by  a  good  one  and  double-faulted.  Heath  tossed 
out  and  netted  next  rally,  40/30,  and  match  points,  all  knowing  well  it 
was  "Davis  Cup  Match  point."  He  double-faulted,  and  the  general  sigh 
of  relief  was  almost  audible.  Heath  missed  an  easy  "pass."  Another 
match  point,  and  the  crowd  laughed  outright  as  Dixon  double-faulted 
again,    but    there    was    no    applause    that    would    have    been    barracking. 

Heath's  neat  return  caused  Dixon  to  net  his  volley,  but  he  scored 
clean  with  a  service.  Again  Dixon  outed,  and  next  netted  a  weak  fore- 
hand volley,  as  he  had  often  done  before,  and  Heath  had  failed  to  notice 
these  misses  on  the  forehand  vollev.  and  had  mistakenly  sent  his  "passes" 
to  his  reliable  backhand.  At  4/5  Pleath  served  and  ran  to  40/30,  driving 
finely,  and  volleying  well.  Then  he  missed  an  easy  volley  after  making 
a  fine  drive,  arid  Dixon  got  within  a  point  by  a  fine  smash.     A  poor  rally

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  31 

was  ended  by  Heath  netting  an  easy  forehand  drive,  and  Dixon  had 
crossed  the  shoals  and  was  safe  in  port,  with  the  cup  aboard — practically. 
Heath  failed  all  through  to  toss  accurately,  and  so  to  test  Dixon's 
weakness  overhead.  Dixon's  tactics  were  good  for  he  kept  up  a  per- 
sistent and  steady  attack  on  Heath's  backhand,  without  risking  errors. 
Heath's  game  was  one-sided  and  lacked  defense.  He  had  to  risk  all  on 
the  strokes    or   else   to   poke  ineffectively. 

BROOKES-DUNLOP    VS.    PARKE-BEAMISH, 

Next  came  the  doubles.  Here  Australasia's  sun  shone  clearly  and  dis- 
pelled the  clouds,  save  for  that  dark  one  on  the  horizon,  which  was  the 
Parke-Heath     tie. 

In  1905  Brookes  and  Dunlop  gave  ample  indication  of  their  prowess 
in  England,  as  their  victories  included  one  over  the  redoubtable  Dohertys, 
6/3.  5/7.  2/6,  6/4,  6/4.  In  the  interval  Brookes  has  ripened  into  greater 
skill,  and  Dunlop  has  in  no  wise  gone  off.  At  Christchurch  he  was  too 
close  to  his  long  sea  journey.  This  time  he  was  the  master  player  of 
the  four  and  his  quiver  of  weapons  was  always  supplied  with  yet  another 
arrow  tipped  with  a  feather-like  delicacy,  or  flying  swift  with  keen  point 
and   finding   the    unguarded  point   in   the    mail. 

In  his  defense  was  no  flaws,  and  defense  with  him  is  an  art  and  a 
deception.  A  smash  hard  at  him  went  hard  onto  his  racket;  the  ball 
sank  into  the  delicate  give  of  his  wrist  and  floated  with  a  perfect  toss 
volley  clear  of  his  opponents,  and  right  on  to  the  base  line;  again  it  was 
taken  with  a  swift  drive  volley,  and  sent  skimming  hard  for  their  feet, 
and  with  a  quick  spring  he  was  after  it,  and  the  answering  weak  reply 
was   caught   before    it   could    fall    low,    and    smashed    for   a   clear   ace. 

Overhead  his  wrist  arched  like  a  serpent's  head;  his  blow  was  as  unerr- 
ing and  as  deadly,  and  there  was  no  antidote  in  the  medicine  chest  of 
the  Englishmen.  Between  him  and  Brookes  the  choice  was  small,  and 
the  alternative  of  avoiding  Dunlop  was  only  to  seek  Brookes.  Hard 
indeed  was  their  case.  Their  position  was  too  far  from  the  net.  Beamish 
I  caught  on  the  camera,  as  he  followed  his  service  in  half  volleying,  just 
behind   the  service   line.      He  needed   at  least   to   be   three   yards   further   in. 

Parke's  team  work  was  lacking.  He  ,  was  too  individual  and  too 
impulsive,  and  the  two  did  not  blend  nor  cover  each  other's  weaknesses. 
Parke   intercepted    well    at  times,    but    was    soon    cured   of   his    risk-taking. 

On  the  whole,  there  were  too  many  errors.  Even  Dunlop  made  several. 
Brookes  made  many  grievous  ones,  and  was  still  far  below  his  best, 
though  the  intense  heat  of  the  previous  day  was  absent.  There  was  a 
lack  of  finish  in  Brookes'  game.  He  would  work  up  an  advantage,  and 
then   mull    it.      He    would    recover   finely,    to   miss   as   badly. 

Parke's  fine  driving  was  ineffective  in  a  double  where  the  net,  being 
closer,  caught  the  ball  earlier  in  its  flight.  To  get  the  ball  in  the  base 
line  is  good  in  singles,  but  to  get  it  to  the  toes  is  the  scheme  in  a 
double — at   least   so   it  seems   to  me. 

The  Englishmen  did  not  toss  enough,  either,  although  the  Australians 
were    close    in. 

Parke  served  first,  and  three  strokes  went  to  Dunlop's  skill;  then  the 
Englishmen  took  five  points.  Australasia  took  three  games  and  led,  3/1, 
and  kept  this  lead  by  winning  all  their  own  services.  At  2/4,  on 
Beamish's  service,  Parke  scored  by  three  fine  interceptions  of  the  returns, 
and  on  Dunlop's  service  Brookes  replied  in  kind,  receiving  eight  across 
the  net,  and  volleying  for  clean  aces.  Great  Britain  responded  with  a 
love  game.  Brookes'  next  service  went  to  deuce,  Dunlop  playing  weakly, 
and  "burring"  an  easy  backhand  smash.  Parke  netted,  and  Brookes 
scored  by  half  volleying  Beamish's  return  straight  back  at  him,  and  the 
latter   drove    out   wildly,    Dunlop   calling    "leave." 

Beamish  took  his  opening  service,  but  that  was  their  only  score  that 
set,  for  here  the  fine   concert  and  splendid   strokes  of  the   home  team  out- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  33 

classed  the  challengers.  Beamish  was  weak  all-round,  and  Parke's  game 
was  full  of  errors  through  trying  too  much,  but  they  were  under  too 
heavy    a   pressure   and    their    games   broke. 

In  the  third  set  the  Englishmen  brightened  and  "games  all"  to  "three- 
all"  were  called.  Brookes  was  pressing,  and  at  times  overreached  into 
errors,  but  his  poaching  was  ujisetting  his  opponents,  who  were  watching 
him  more  than  the  ball.  At  two-all  the  Englishmen  had  taken  Dunlop's 
service,  and  thus  had  the  lead  and  "to  serve,"  and  a  chance  to  score  the 
set,  but  it  faded  quickly.  The  opening  rally  was  the  finest  ever  seen  in 
this  hemisphere.  At  least  four  times  the  speed  and  severity  of  the  ball 
seemed  to  have  Dunlop — on  whom  the  play  was  centered — beaten,  but 
his  low  volleys  and  half  volleys  sent  the  ball  skimming  low  over  the  net, 
and  in  his  last  he  was  in  the  act  of  falling  to  his  knee  as  he  struck. 
Despairing  of  defeating  him  the  play  was  driven  on  to  Brookes  and  he 
responded  with  a  vicious  lift  drive  that  sent  the  ball  skimming  down 
Parke's  right  side  line.  Back  it  came  and  a  deep  toss  went  to  Beamish. 
He  rose  with  his  labored  arm  action  and  sent  the  ball  well  over  the  base 
line.  The  applause  halted  the  game  for  quite  a  time.  The  whole  game 
was  full  of  crisp,  fierce  rallies.  This  height  of  the  Englishmen's  game 
could   only   hold   our   men,   and  they   pulled   level   at  four-all. 

Brookes  served  and  won  to  15.  On  Beamish's  service  Australasia  led 
30-love,  Dunlop  having  saved  by  a  deep  toss  from  the  boundary  of  a  hard 
smash,  and  after  a  tussle  England  evened  at  five-all.  It  was  now  a 
superb  contest.  Dunlop  served  and  led,  40/15,  and  took  the  game  to  30, 
Dunlop    playing   somewhat   poorly. 

Parke  served  and  Beamish  scored  one  ace  by  a  fine  interception,  but 
smashed  a  "sitter"  into  the  net.  Brookes  outed  a  deep  left  drive,  deuce. 
A  pretty  duel  of  sharply  angled,  delicate,,  short  drops  followed  between 
Parke  and  Brookes,  and  then  Brookes  varied  by  a  hard  drive  at  Beamish, 
who  drove  weakly  into  the  gallery.  Match  point.  A  long  rally  followed, 
and  Brookes  saved  by  a  fine  toss  on  the  half-volley,  and  at  last  Beamish 
smashed  out  with  his  usual  labored  wrist  work.  It  is  the  action  of  a 
bowler  at  cricket,  but  there  are  no  fingers  to  keep  the  ball  in  hand  till 
the  right  instant.  The  "throw"  is  the  more  correct  action  for  free 
smashing.  

BROOKES  A'S.  DIXON. 

Now  came  the  meeting  of  the  two  captains,  and  here  was  a  test  of 
Brookes'  supremacy.  Dixon  had  in  England  defeated  Gobert  and  Decugis, 
and  Gobert  is  the  acclaimed  champion  of  Europe — after  Wilding.  Would 
Brookes  rehabilitate  his  fame  after  his  defeat  by  Parke,  and  in  so  doing 
establish  also  that  Parke  is  a  new  star  of  the  first  magnitude?  Truly, 
Brookes  did  so,  in  a  great  measure,  and  it  cannot  be  claimed  that  Dixon 
was  at  his  best.  His  teammates  did  not  think  so,  and  they  are  abso- 
lutely   impartial   in   keen   criticisms. 

Still,  theV  and  Dixon  himself  admitted  he  was  near  his  game,  and 
in  the  last  six  games  Dixon  acknowledged  that  he  was  almost  in  his  full 
stride.  And  what  happened?  Brookes  took  nine  games  in  succession 
after  2/1  in  Dixon's  favor,  and  by  fine  play.  It  was  not  yet  free  of 
the  errors  that  were  a  new  element  in  his  game;  but  this  was  com- 
pensated for  by  the  dynamic  intensity  of  his  play;  not  speedy  strokes, 
but  yet  swift  to  win,  for  Dixon  only  scored  twelve  points  in  those  nine 
games,  and  he  did  not  slump  at  all.  He  played  a  good,  strong  game 
and   tried    out   all    his   devices,    to   be   answered   with   more    deadly   weapons. 

Brookes  adhered  to  his  close  quarter  volleying  attack  on  his  own 
services,  but  on  Dixon's  services  Brookes  had  first  to  dislodge  him  by 
skillful  ground  strokes  in  which  he  was  greatly  assisted  by  his  capacity 
to   take   the   service   from    two   yards   inside   the   base   line. 

In  the  third  game  of  the  match  Dixon  dislodged  Brookes  from  the 
net  by  good  tosses.  After  that  came  Brookes'  run  of  nine  games,  in 
which   his   volleys   had   almost    their    old    sting   and   the   ball    hung    to    the

hand — awkward  but  effective.

ground.  Frequently  Brookes  scored  by  attacking  Dij^on's  forehand. 
Dixon  scored  many  aces  by  finely  concealed  drives  and  perfect  low  volleys 
from    far    back.  ,      ,  , 

Dixon  was  risking  his  services  to  some  profit,  in  spite  of  many  double- 
faults.  Dixon  broke  the  run  at  0/4  in  the  second  set,  after  a  finely 
contested  game,  in  which  the  Englishman's  volleying  was  cheered  freely. 
Brookes  secured  his  next  service,  5/1,  but  Dixon  by  a  stubborn  and 
clever  defense  ran  to  4/5.  One  ace  came  to  him  by  a  purely  concealed 
clean  chop  drive,  after  two  severe  drives.  Brookes'  serving  took  the  set 
on  the  tenth  game  to  15.  Dixon's  play  had  greatly  improved  by  the  con- 
cealment  and    greater   variation    of   his    strokes. 

Dixon  served  and  led,  40/15,  but  here  Brookes  rediscovered  his  severe 
lift  drive,  and  took  four  strokes.  We  who  know  Brookes  know  also  that 
in  this  drive  for  pace  and  severity  he  is  second  to  none  if  he  cared  to 
again  resort  to  it,  iDut  it  is  only  with  him  now  an  occasional  weapon. 
Dixon  took  Brookes'  service  by  fine  driving,  and  took  his  own  by  fine 
volleying,  in  spite  of  Brookes'  severe  lift  drives.  He  led,  2/1,  but  the 
pace  was  telling  and  as  he  took  breath  Brookes  took  the  next  game  easily. 

Brookes  now  spurted,  and  his  whole  game  gained  in  severity  of  pace 
and  place.  He  took  Dixon's  service  by  fine  passes,  one  when  seemingly 
defeated.  Dixon  responded.  Brookes  in  turn  had  to  take  a  breather, 
and  coming  on  rather  slowly  left  Dixon  room  to  return  to  his  feet. 
Three-all    and    then    4/3    as    Brookes    forged    ahead. 

The  next  struggle  was  heroic,  ten  deuces  being  called.  Every  device 
in  the  game  was  used  by  each  in  turn  and  Dixon  varied  splendidly.  It 
tested  the  endurance  of  each  and  went  to  Dixon,  although  he  had  to 
chase  hard  in  many  of  the  twenty-eight  rallies.  Think  of  twenty-eight 
rallies  in  one  game  and  then  cease  to  wonder  that  Dixon  faltered  and 
could    do   no    more!      Four-all. 

Brookes  served  and  pressing  severely  took  the  game  to  15.  Dixon 
served  and  led,  30/15,  by  fine  driving,  after  Brookes  had  dislodged  him, 
but  Brookes  surprised  him  by  a  sudden,  concentration  of  play  on  his 
exposed  forehand,  and  the  rubbers  were  equal,  Australasia  leading  in 
sets  and  games.  

PARKE    VS.    HEATH. 

How  could  Heath  be  expected  to  succeed  where  Brookes  had  failed? 
How  could  he  volley  drives  which  had  defeated  Brookes?  It  was  just 
in  failing  to  realize  this  impossibility  that  he  failed  most.  While  he 
himself  staved  back  he  had  a  chance,  but  when  he  closed  in  it  was  to  be 
passed   relentlessly,    and    the    physical    strain   was   too    great    for    him   also. 

His  forehand  drives  were  commanding,  and  his  backhand  driving  was 
much  more  severe  than  against  Dixon,  but  his  backhand  volleys  were 
pushy  and  were  followed  by  a  killing  drive  by  Parke  that  scored  each 
time,  for  though  dropping  short  Parke  was  always  fleet-footed  enough  to 
reach    them    on    the    bounce. 

Parke  led,  2/0,  4/1,  and  5/2  in  the  first  set.  Then  Heath  took  Parke's 
service  with  fine  forehand  drives  that  were  so  well  concealed  and  of 
such  depth  that  Parke  did  not  attempt  to  run  to  them.  iHeath's  difficulty 
also  is  that  though  he  volleys  severely  in  the  forehand,  it  is  not  the 
true,  stiff-wristed  volley  made  with  the  forearm,  but  a  labored  conversion 
of  a  lift  drive,  on  which  he  loses  time  by  using  the  whole  arm  and  the 
shoulder  stiffly.  It  is  efl^ective,  but  ugly,  slow  and  too  labored  to  be  free 
of  risk,  and   the   direction   of  it  cannot  be   well  concealed. 

When,  as  a  result  of  fine  drives,  he  got  an  advantage  he  threw  many 
away  by  closing  in  on  the  net  to  be  passed,  and  when  he  was  not  passed 
tried  to  slow  drops,  which  he  netted  or  which  were  reached,  instead  of 
going  to  a  severe  volley.  Still,  it  is  his  method,  and  it  was  not  good 
enough. 

He  led,  2/0,   in   the   second   set,  driving  finely,   with   depth  and    pace,   but

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  87 

Parke  came  at  him  with  greater  pace  and  dash,  and  led,  3/2,  volleying 
only   to    finish    his  gained    advantages. 

At  2/5  Heath  spurted  gamely  and,  staying  back  and  driving  cleanly, 
led,  4/3.  Parke  had  no  one  to  pass  and  was  so  deprived  of  his  best 
scoring  chanres.  Then  the  pressure  told  on  Heath  and  he  lost  snap. 
Then    Parke    took   three   games   and    had   two   sets   to    none. 

Heath  again  took  the  opening  game,  and  again  mistakingly  sought  the 
net.  He  attacked  Parke's  backhand,  and,  as  with  Dixon,  could  not  volley 
Parke's  severe  backhand  cross-court  drives.  Still,  he  forestalled  these  a 
bit,  and  com])elled  Parke  to  go  down  the  alley,  and  in  that  the  latter  is 
labored    and    ineffective. 

The  second  game  went  to  Parke  to  love  by  fine  passes,  but  it  was  like 
shelling    peas    for    him    to    pass    Heath. 

Parke  took  the  third  game,  but  got  erratic  (for  the  first  time)  in  the 
fourth.  Was  even  he  nervous  with  the  cup  almost  landed?  Again  Parke 
scored  by  fine  driving,  and  Heath  let  the  last  go.  Evidently  done  up,  4/2, 
Heath,  however,  braced  pluckily,  and  got  to  four-all  by  a  good  back-court 
game,  followed  judiciously,  but  rarely  to  the  net,  and  Parke  made  more 
errors.  Again,  Parke  spurted  at  four-all  and  led,  5/4.  Just  here  the 
score  of  the  whole  match  was  level  in  rubber  sets  and  games  at  2/8/85 
each,  close  enough,    surely,   even   to    please   so  vast  a   crowd. 

In  the  last  game,  30-all,  was  called,  and  Heath  netted  after  a  long 
rally.  Match  point.  Finally,  he  finished  by  tossing  out  after  another 
long  rally,  and  the  cup  was  booked  for  its  return  journey  frop-  the 
Antipodes,   and    the    crowd    cheered    their    visitors    heartily. 

And   now,   in    conclusion,   let  me   say   just    this,   and   it   is   timely: 

In  England  there  has  been  for  years  much  talk  of  altering  the  condi- 
tions of  this  cup.  To  my  mind  they  are  perfectly  framed.  Limit  or 
mechanically  rotate  the  contest  in  its  locality  and  what  would  be  the 
result?  Only  those  who  lived  near  the  place  where  it  was  to  be  played 
that  year  would  compete,  and  the  whole  competition  would  lose  interest. 
Witness  the  European  championship,  won  by  Kingscote  this  year  and 
by  inferior  players  in  other  years.  The  Australasian  championships  also 
are    rotated    in    the   various   States,   and    are   won    by    quite    inferior    players. 

On  the  contrary,  consider  what  the  cup  has  done  for  the  game  all  over 
the  world  and  in  Australia.  I  can  speak  with  certainty.  It  has  been 
the    little   leaven    which    has    leavened    the    whole    lump. 

Before  it  came  we  thought  we  knew  the  game.  Now  we  just  realize 
its  infinite  possibilities,  and  right  here,  for  Australasia,  I  think  I  am 
.qualified,  by  my  general  reception  as  an  Australian  writer,  to  say  that 
if  we  never  again  get  your  cup  back  we  shall  realize  that  we  owe  to  it 
the  best  incidents  and  matches  in  the  game  we  have  ever  known,  and  we 
take  off  our  hats  to  Dwight  Davis  and  those  who,  with  him,  have  framed 
ideal  conditions,  save  only  that  the  contests  each  year  might  be  fixed  so 
that  nations  entering  might  in  the  play-off  be  entitled  to  play  the  nearest 
first.      The    summaries    of  the    whole    contest   follow:

National  Championships  for  Women 

Under  the  most  remarkable  conditions,  with  rain  and  unseasonable 
weather  prevailing  almost  throughout  the  tournament,  the  Women's 
National  Championships  were  decided  on  the  courts  of  the  Philadelphia 
Cricket  Grounds,  St.  Martin's,  Pa.,  June  lo  to  15.  The  three  titles  decided 
were  women's  singles  and  doubles  and  mixed  doubles.  New  blood  came 
to  the  front  with  a  rush,  each  of  the  five  winners  obtaining  a  place  on  the 
championship   roster   for   the    first   time. 

Miss  Mary  Browne  of  Los  Angeles,  Cal.,  was  the  star  of  the  occasion, 
and  in  the  final  struggle,  after  qualifying  in  the  preliminary  round,  came 
through  with  three  national  titles.  She  accounted  for  the  singles  title  by- 
virtue  of  her  easy  straight  set  victory  over  Miss  Eleanora  Sears;  the  dou- 
bles by  her  decisive  win — partnered  with  Miss  Dorothy  Green  of  Philadel- 
delphia^from  Mrs.  Barger-Wallach  and  Mrs.  Frederick  Schmitz,  both  of 
New  York,  ^id  the  mixed  doubles,  in  collaboration  with  Richard  Norris 
Williams,  Jr.  of  Philadelphia,  by  gaining  a  victory  from  Miss  Sears  and 
former   champion   William  J.    Clothier. 

In  the  first  round  Miss  Marion  Fenno  lost  the  second  set  of  her  match 
with  Miss  Clara  Chase,  but  wop  the  third  set  easily.  Another  close  match 
was  the  one  between  Miss  E.  G.  Ostheimer  and  Miss  May  Sayres,  the 
former  winning.  In  the  second  round  Miss  Fenno's  steadiness  proved  too 
much  for  Miss  Dorothy  Green,  and  the  Boston  player  won  after  dropping 
the  second  set.  Long  and  hard  fought  matches  resulted  when  Miss  Alex- 
ander met  Miss  Ostheimer  and  Miss  Wheeler  played  Miss  A.  Hensel,  the 
former   winning   in   each   case. 

Both  the  semi-final  matches  were  very  close  and  strenuously  contested. 
Miss  Browne  got  started  first  against  Miss  Browning,  winning  the  first  set 
at  6/4,  only  to  drop  tlie  second  at  6/3.  The  struggle  came  in  the  third 
set,  and  Miss  Browne  was  just  a  little  more  dependable  in  the  pinches  and 
a  little  more  ready  to  take  advantage  of  .her  opportunities.  The  set  and 
match  finally  went  to  Miss  Browne  at  9/7.  Despite  its  closeness  the  match 
did  not  produce  very  good  tennis,  and  Miss  Browne  especially  was  out- 
spoken in  saying  that  it  was  much  below  par.  Miss  Sears  started  slackly 
and  dropped  the  first  set  to  Miss  Merrick;  but  this  spurred  her  on  and 
she  allowed  her  opponent  but  two  more  games  in  the   match. 

In  the  final  round,  against  Miss  Sears,  Miss  Browne  was  easily  the 
master.  It  furnished  better  tennis  than  the  Browne-Browning  match,  but 
it  was  far  from  being  first  class.  There  was  no  challenge  round.  Miss 
Browne  becoming  champion  through  the  default  of  Mrs.  G.  W.  Wightman 
of   San   Francisco. 

In  the  women's  doubles  three  teams  stood  out  above  all  the  others — Miss 
Browne  and  Miss  Green,  Mrs.  Wallach  and  Mrs.  Schmitz,  and  Miss  Sears 
and  Miss  Feni  0.  The  last  two  pairs  met  in  the  semi-final  round  and  Mrs. 
Wallach  and  Mrs.  Schmitz  proved  too  good  for  their  opponents,  winning 
in  straight  sets.  The  final  round  was  almost  a  runaway  for  Miss  Browne 
and  Miss  Green. 

Several  good  matches  were  played  in  the  preliminary  round  of  the  mixed 
doubles.  IMiss  Whiting  and  II.  M.  Tilden  won  from  Miss  Elisabeth  Moore 
and  J.  R.  Carpenter,  Jr.,  in  a  match  that  went  to  three  sets  and  39  games, 
while  it  required  the  same  number  of  sets  and  almost  as  many  games  for 
Miss  Browne  and  R.  N.  Williams,  Jr.,  to  defeat  Mrs.  W.  L.  Rice  and  her 
brother,    W.   F.   Johnson. 

Close  matches  were  the  rule  in  the  second  round  also.  Mrs.  Wallach 
and  Craig  Biddle  made  a  stubborn  resistance  to  Miss  Browne  and  R.  N. 
Williams,  Jr.,  each  of  the  two  sets  played  requiring  20  games.  Miss  Browne 
and   Williams   had  all   they   could   do   to   win   from   Miss   Fenno   and   G.    L.

Wrenn,  Jr.  The  match,  which  was  played  on  Friday,  was  one  of  the  finest 
of  the  entire  tournament,  and  abounded  in  sensational  plays  and  splendid 
rallies.  Miss  Fenno  and  Wrenn  excelled  in  steadiness,  but  were  not  quite 
severe  enough  to  win.  ,        ,    ,         ^  ,  r  r        ■»*• 

The  final  round  which  was  played  late  Saturday  afternoon,  after  Miss 
Browne  had  won  both  her  singles  and  doubles  final,  provided  excitement  in 
plenty.  There  were  lightning  changes  during  the  entire  match,  first  one 
side  leading  and  then  the  other.  The  situation  was  tense.  All  four  were 
keyed  to  concert  pitch,  and  while  all  were  erratic  at  times,  each  made  up 
for  these  lapses  by  making  point-winning  shots  at  critical  stages.  Miss 
Browne  and  Williams  finally  pulled  the  match  out  at  11/9,  after  their  oppo- 
nents had  been  three  times  within  a  point  of  winning.     The  summaries:

R.  N.  WILLIAMS, 
National   Clay  Court  Champion,    1912. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  45 


Third  Clay  Court  Championship 

With  an  overflowing  entry  list  of  players  of  national  fame,  close  com- 
petitions throughout  and  excellent  management,  the  third  clay  court  cham- 
pionships were  decided  on  the  courts  of  the  Pittsburgh  Athletic  Association, 
Pittsburgh,    Pa.,    June    22    to   July    i. 

G.  F.  Touchard  and  R.  D.  Little,  the  doubles  champions,  headed  the  list 
in  the  men's  events  and  were  supported  by  W.  M.  Hall,  R.  N.  Williams, 
Jr.,  the  Philadelphia  phenomenon,  and  Harold  H.  Hackett,  former  doubles 
champion.  The  latter,  however,  played  only  in  the  doubles  event  partnered 
with  Hall. 

In  the  women's  events  the  competitors  included  Miss  Mary  Browne,  the 
1912  national  champion;  Miss  May  Sutton,  national  title  holder  in  1904 
and  1906  and  British  champion  in  same  years;  Miss  Dorothy  Green  of 
Philadelphia   and   Miss   Lois   Moyes   of   Toronto. 

R,  N.  Williams,  Jr.,  won  the  tournament  and  successfully  challenged 
Hayes  for  the  title.  Hackett  and  Hall  duplicated  this  feat  with  regard  to 
the  doubles.  Miss  May  Sutton,  the  Californian,  defeated  her  only  rival. 
Miss  Browne,  and  was  awarded  the  title  of  first  clay  champion  in  women's 
singles  and  then,  paired  with  Fred  Harris,  accounted  for  the  mixed  doubles 
by  defeating  Miss  Browne  and  Williams. 

In  each  case  the  victories  were  well  earned  and  there  was  no  existing 
doubt  as  to  correctness  of  the  placing.  Williams  was  the  star  performer 
of  the  tournament  and  exhibited  wonderful  skill  throughout.  He  did  not 
lose  a  set  and  at  no  time  was  in  serious  danger  of  doing  so.  The  meeting 
had  not  proceeded  very  far  when  it  was  seen  that  he  was  destined  to  meet 
Touchard  for  the  title.  This  caused  much  speculation  among  the  devotees, 
with  Williams  as  the  favorite.  Everyone  had  been  given  an  opportunity  to 
witness  his  splendid  work,  while  Touchard,  despite  his  reputation  as  No.  4 
ranking,  revealed  none  of  his  true  form  until  Friday  of  the  meeting. 
Against  Williams,  the  New  York  player  was  unable  to  make  much  head- 
way, and  the  Quaker  accomplished  his  downfall  in  straight  sets,  only  one 
of  which  went  to  deuce. 

The  men's  doubles  was  a  disappointment,  especially  toward  the  end,  when 
Hackett  and  Hall  were  having  it  all  their  own  way.  Despite  this  fact  it 
was  good  tennis  for  the  most  part  and  abounded  in  lightning  fa§t  rallies 
and  alternating  duels  of  attack.  Hackett  was  the  star  at  all  times,  and  his 
shots   were  all   dangerous. 

There  were  twenty-one  entries  in  the  women's  singles.  No  one  who 
watched  Miss  Sutton  closely  could  have  had  much  doubt  as  to  the  result. 
There  was  something  in  her  onslaught  that  inspired  confidence  and  victory 
to  the  onlooker  and  must  have  been  daunting  to  her  adversaries.  Miss 
Browne  was  her  only  formidable  opponent,  but  in  their  meeting  in  the 
final   round  Miss   Sutton   outplayed  her  opponent,   winning  in  straight  sets.

Intercollegiate  Championship 

By  its  victory  in  both  the  doubles  and  singles  events,  counting  for  seven 
points,  Princeton  University  won  the  premier  honors  in  the  thirty-second 
annual  tournament  of  the  Intercollegiate  Lawn  Tennis  Association,  on  the 
courts  of  the  Merion  Cricket  Club,  Haverford,  Pa.,  September  4  and  the 
following  days.  In  capturing  the  singles  title  Princeton  won  permanent 
possession  of  the  Isaac  H.  Clothier  cup,  which  has  been  in  competition  for 
six  years. 

George  Myers  Church  won  the  singles,  and  with  Winifred  H.  Mace,  cap- 
tured the  doubles.  The  tournament  was  highly  successful,  the  entries 
representing  a  class  higher  than  for  a  number  of  years,  and  the  play  was 
correspondingly  as  good.  In  the  singles  event  the  final  produced  a  sensa- 
tional rnatch  between  Church  and  John  G.  Nelson  of  Dartmouth,  the  latter 
college  just  being  admitted  to  the  association.  Nelson  was  within  one  point 
of  the  match  when  a  close  decision  was  made  on  his  service,  and  had  it 
been   in  his  favor  the  title   would   have  been   his  instead   of   Church's. 

The  doubles  final  was  also  very  exciting  and  closely  contested.  Church 
and  Mace  finally  won  it  from  E.  H.  Whitney  and  W.  M.  Washburn  of 
Harvard,  thirty-six  games  being  played  in  the  first  two  sets.  The  Crimson 
pair  won  the  first  set,   but  the  succeeding  three  went  to  the  Princetonians. 

The  colleges  represented  were:  Princeton,  by  G.  M.  Church,  W.  H. 
Mace,  W.  S.  Kuhn  and  J.  R.  Montgomery;  Harvard,  by  E.  H.  Whitney, 
W.  M.  Washburn,  J.  C.  Devereux  and  Q.  A.  S.  McKean;  Dartmouth,  by 
T.  G.  Nelson  and  W.  H.  Webber;  Unive'rsity  of  Pennsylvania,  bv  A.  W. 
Jones,  W.  H.  Tilden,  R.  Jamison  and  H.  W.  Page;  Yale,  by  A.  H.  Man, 
Jr.,  E.  W.  Peaslee,  A.  Evans,  Jr.  and  R.  C.  Gates;  University  of  Pitts- 
burgh, by  J.  C.  Mackrell  and  A.  P.  Wright;  University  of  Minnesota,  by 
J.  J.  Armstrong  and  L.  M.  Stellwagen;  and  Williams  University,  by  L.  A. 
Fletcher  and   F.   A.   Victor. 

The  semi-finalists  were  Nelson,  who  opposed  Page  by  virtue  of  his  vic- 
tory over  Kuhn,  and  Church,  who  was  drawn  against  Whitney.  The  first- 
mentioned  pair's  match  was  close  for  the  first  set,  Page's  chops  being 
effective  for  a  time;  but  after  that  Nelson's  speed  and  steadiness  was  too 
much  for  the  University  of  Pennsylvania  man.  The  other  battle  was 
expected  to  be  very  close,  opinions  being  divided  as  to  the  outcome.  It 
was  altogether  one-sided,  however,  Church  being  at  the  very  top  of  his 
game  and    winning  in   straight  sets. 

Notwithstanding  Nelson's  easy  victories  and  good  play  he  was  fancied 
by  only  a  few  of  the  wiseacres  in  the  final  round.  Most  of  the  spectators 
expected  to  watch  a  runaway  match,  so  great  was  the  belief  in  Church's 
ability.      The   summaries:

Interscholastic  Championship 

The  interscholastic  championship  was  held  at  the  Casino  courts,  New- 
port, R.  I.,  in  conjunction  with  the  national  singles  and  doubles  champion- 
ships. Under  the  personal  direction  of  R.  D.  Wrenn,  it  was  featured  and 
attracted   m.uch  attention. 

Clifton  B.  Herd,  Phillips-Exeter  Academy,  finally  won  the  laurels  by 
defeating  Jerry  H.  Weber  of  Harvard  School,  Chicago,  111.,  in  the  final 
round,  3/6,  6/2,  6/4,  6/2.  The  draw  brought  together  Herd  and  William 
L.  McKim  of  Hill  School,  Pottstown,  Pa.,  the  University  of  Pennsylvania 
interscholastic  champion,  and  Vanderbilt  G.  Ward  of  St.  Paul's  School, 
Concord,  N.  H.,  the  Columbia  winner,  against  Brooklyn's  star  Polytechnic 
player,  Hammett  Norton,  Princeton  interscholastic  champion.  Jerry  H. 
Weber,  the  Illinois  University  representative,  got  a  default  by  the  absence 
of   Rogers,   while   R.    S.    Maynard,   the   Yale   sub-freshman,  drew  the  bye. 

The  best  contest  of  the  tournament  was  in  the  second  round.  Weber 
was  right  on  edge  in  his  match  against  Maynard.  and  he  forced  matters 
continually.  He  was  good  all-round,  aggressive,  going  for  the  stroke  con- 
tinually, and  yet,  with  it  all,  very  steady.  It  was  the  force  of  his  attack 
that  seemed  to  disconcert  Maynard,  and  except  in  the  second  set,  which  he 
won  at   6/2,   the   Brooklyn   youngster  had   the   worst   of  it. 

Herd  won  from  Ward  in  straight  sets,  yet  forty-nine  games  were  required, 
and   in   the  first  two   Ward  had   excellent   chances  to   win. 

The  final  round  between  Herd  and  Weber  proved  disappointing.  The 
Illinois  youngster  did  not  play  nearly  so  well  as  he  did  against  Maynard, 
seeming  to  be  either  tired  or  stale  after  the  first  set,  which  he  won  at  6/3 
by  playing  well-balanced  tennis.  Herd  was  extremely  erratic,  however,  and 
deserved  to  lose.  In  the  second  set  Herd  improved  and  Weber  went  off. 
The  latter  scored  most  of  his  points  on  his  opponent's  double  faults  and 
serves,  and  lacked  the  snap  and  speed  which  characterized  him  in  his 
opening  matches.      The   summaries:

Miss  May  G.  Sutton  and  Miss  Mary  K.  Browne — scored  a  grand  slam, 
when,  in  all  four  of  the  events  in  which  they  entered,  they  captured  all 
the  honors  and  very   nearly  all  the  points. 

The  tournament  was  unquestionably  the  banner  event  since  the  historic 
meeting  in  the  World's  Fair  year,  and  the  general  interest  taken,  both  by 
the    spectators    and    players,  proved  that    Chicago    is   a   keen   tennis   center. 

In  the  third  day's  play  one  of  the  sensations  of  the  tournament  was 
sprung  when  Alex.  Squair,  the  University  of  Chicago  and  Wisconsin  State 
champion,  defeated  L.  Harry  Waidner  in  straight  sets,  6/3,  9/7.  Squair 
is  the  leader  of  the  younger  players  of  the  Middle  West,  but  no  one 
thought  him  capable  of  defeating  the  veteran  Waidner.  Still  greater  sur- 
prise was  occasioned  when,  after  playing  two  singles  and  one  doubles 
match — 66  games  in  all — Squair  went  on  the  court  late  in  the  afternoon 
and  all  but  defeated   Fred  C.   Inman  in   the  most  brilliant  kind   of  a  match. 

Before  the  largest  "gallery"  that  ever  witnessed  a  tennis  match  in  Chi- 
cago, Inman  and  Bundy  met  in  the  final  round,  Bundy  winning  after  five 
sterling  sets.  Great  as  was  this  match  it  was  clearly  outclassed,  when 
Bundv,  as  challenger,  faced  his  teammate,  McLoughlin,  in  the  challenge 
round.  No  better  tennis  was  ever  seen  in  the  West  than  the  first  set  of 
this  match. 

McLoughlin,  as  usual,  started  out  in  whirlwind  fashion,  but  Bundy  took 
the  set  at  10/8.  In  the  second  set  Bundy  was  very  evidently  conserving 
his  strength  and  contented  himself  with  making  McLoughlin  cover  as  much 
court  as  possible,  the  "Comet"  having  things  very  much  h'is  own  way  and 
winning  out  quite  easily  at  6/1.  The  third  set,  however,  was  a  battle- 
royal,  and  as  each  man  was  serving  grandly  and  covering  by  close  play 
at  the  net,  the  score  alternated  until  4-all  was  called.  Then — in  the  ninth 
game  with  Bundy  leading  at  40  love — a  bad  decision  on  the  baseline  gave 
McLoughlin  a  point  and  unnerved  Bundy  to  such  a  degree  that  he  double- 
faulted  twice  and  eventually  lost  the  game  before  he  regained  his  accus- 
tomed poise.  McLoughlin  followed  quickly  by  taking  the  next  on  his  own 
service,   and   with   it   the  set,   at   6/4. 

A  shower,  coming  up  immediately  after  the  termination  of  the  third  set, 
prolonged  the  rest  period  to  half  an  hour,  and  when  the  players  reap- 
peared Bundy  seemed  the  most  refreshed.  The  first  game,  a  long  deuce 
affair,  was  Bundy's  at  10/8,  but  McLoughlin  evened  by  taking  the  next. 
The  next  two  alternated,  bringing  the  score  to  2-all.  In  the  fifth,  however, 
Bundy  broke  through  McLoughlin's  service  and,  following  with  his  own, 
led  at  4/2.  Then — with  all  the  odds  in  Bundy's  favor — McLoughlin  staged 
one  of  his  terrific  onslaughts,  and  driving  and  serving  with  cannon-like 
speed,  ran  out  the  next  four  games  and  the  set  and  match,  the  final  score 
standing,    8/10,   6/1,   6/4,    6/4   in   McLoughlin's   favor. 

In  the  women's  events,  and  in  the  mixed  doubles,  chief  interest  lay  in 
the  work  of  the  Californians,  Miss  May  Sutton  and  Miss  Mary  K.  Browne 
— and  the  singles  was,  in  reality,  merely  an  obstacle  race  to  see  which  of 
the  other  women  could  make  the  best  "showing"  against  the  California 
stars.      The    summaries:

W.   J.   CLOTHIER.  G.    P.    GARDNER.   JR. 

,       Winners  Eastern  Doubles,  1912. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Lon^wood  Singles  and  Eastern  Doubles 

The  twenty-second  annual  tournament  of  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club  of 
Boston,  Mass.,  was  held  on  the  club's  courts,  beginning  July  15,  with  the 
Longwood  singles  and  Eastern  doubles  events  making  up  the  programme. 
For  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  the  Longwood  singles  event,  the  name 
of  a  Californian  found  a  place  on  the  trophy,  when  Maurice  E.  McLough- 
li'n  came  successfully  through  the  tourney  and  challenged  the  title  holder, 
E.  P.  Earned,  the  Californian  winning  in  straight  sets. 

In  the  doubles,  William  J.  Clothier  and  G.  P.  Gardner,  Jr.,  won  the 
title  by  defeating  Beals  C.   Wright  and   Karl   C.   Behr. 

The  challenge  round,  McLoughlin  versus  E.  P.  Earned,  played  on  Wed- 
nesday, July  24,  was,  as  anticipated,  somewhat  in  the  nature  of  an  anti- 
climax. The  younger  Earned  had  been  in  Boston  for  about  a  week,  playing 
nearly  every  day;  but  he  was  known  to  be  short  of  practice,  and  McEough- 
lin  had  come  on  so  rapidly  that  his  victory  was  regarded  as  a  foregone 
conclusion.  For  once  expectations  were  realized,  and  the  Californian  won 
in   straight   sets,   without   being  pushed   at  any   time. 

The  first  five  games  were  one-sided,  the  loser  getting  only  one  point. 
McEoughlin  led  at  4/1  before  Earned  came  to  life.  By  good  placing  h,e 
then  brought  the  score  to  3/4  and  4/5.  Then  McEoughlin  won  the  tenth 
game  on  his  own  service.  The  second  set  was  much  easier,  although 
Earned  led  at  2/1,     Five  games  in  a  row  then  went  to  the  Californian. 


There  were  just  thirty-two  pairs  out  for  the  Eastern  Doubles  Champion- 
ship and  the  honor  of  competing  at  Chicago  for  the  right  to  challenge  the 
national  champions,  Eittle  and  Touchard.  In  the  first  round  the  fur  flew 
when  R.  C.  Seaver  and  G.  T.  Putnam  met  Freddie  Baggs  and  S.  H. 
Voshell,  the  New  York  combination.  After  winning  the  first  set  the  Bos- 
tonians  slumped  somewhat  and  dropped  the  next  two.  They  won  the  fourth 
easily  but  were  forced  to  a  9/7   score  before  they   secured  the  victory. 

N.  P.  Hallowell  and  J.  Nowell  scored  the  upset  of  the  second  round 
when  they  put  F.  C.  Inman  and  E.  P.  Earned  out  of  the  running — and 
with  the  loss  of  only  one  set  at  that.  Their  victory  was  earned,  however, 
and  they  were  clearly  the  better  team.  H.  H.  Hackett  and  E.  E.  Mahan 
dropped  a  long-drawn-out  set  to  F.  J.  Sulloway  and  E.  H.  Whitney,  but 
braced  after  that.  R.  N.  Williams,  Jr.  and  Craig  Biddle  made  short  work 
of  Hallowell  and  Nowell  on  Thursday  until  the  rain  came,  leading  at  that 
point  two  sets  to  love  and  1/2  in  the  third  set.  The  next  morning  the 
match  was  resumed  and  it  speedly  took  on  a  new  complexion.  At  3-all  the 
Bostonians  broke  through  Williams'service,  won  their  own  and  then  treated 
Biddle's  in  the  same  harsh  manner. 

At  the  outset  it  became  apparent  that  Clothier  and  Gardner  were  most 
emphatically  on  their  game,  and  that  Wright  and  Behr  were  groping  just  a 
little.  Behr  was  full  of  fire  and  dash,  but  he  was  often  too  eager  to  make 
the  kill;  and  while  Wright  would  occasionally  step  forward  and  land  on 
the  ball  in  his  inimitable  manner,  angling  it  sharply  and  with  tremendous 
speed,   the  majority  of  his   shots   were   moderate  as  to   pace. 

Winning  the  first  set  at  6/2,  Clothier  and  Gardner  dropped  the  second 
by  a  6/4  score.  Up  to  this  point  the  match  was  very  even,  but  Wright 
and  Behr  were  never  in  the  running  thereafter. 

Hackett  and  Mahan  were  at  cross  purposes  in  their  match  with  Niles 
and  Dabney — at  first  passively  and  then  actively.  Mahan  was  fair  in  the 
first  set,  but  he  got  worse  and  worse  and  finally  went  all  to  pieces. 
Hackett  was  erratic  and  ineffective  most  of  the  timr,  with  occasional  good 
streaks.     Their  opponents  had  only  to  keep  putting  them  back  to   win;  and

they  turned. the  trick  in  straight  sets.  Dabney  was  the  better  of  the  two, 
and   neither   of  them  was  anything   wonderful. 

Everybody,  including  the  winning  pair,  conceded  victory  to  Williams  and 
Biddle  over  Seaver  and  Putnam.  Yet  the  latter  pair  put  up  a  good  fight 
and  carried  the  first  and  second  sets  to  deuce,  only  to  fall  off  materially  in 
the  third.  Clothier  and  Gardner  defeated  Niles  and  Dabney  with  the  loss 
of  one  set — the  second.  Dabney  was  erratic  and  inclined  to  hit  into  the 
net  or  out.  In  this  manner  he  lost  his  first  service  game.  The  set  went 
easily  to  the  ultimate  winners  at  6/2.  After  getting  a  lead  of  3/1  in 
the  second  set  Clothier  and  Gardner  met  with  a  rebuff.  .Gardner  was  serv- 
ing excellently  and  effectively  but  was  rather  unsteady.  For  a  time  their 
team  work  was  ragged  and  they  lost  ground  steadily.  Niles  and  Dabney 
stiffened  their  play  and  ran  out  the  set  at  6/3.  They  started  well  in  the 
third,  winning  the  first  two  games  and  then  getting  to  3/1  ;  but  they 
relapsed  into  errors  and  their  opponents  soon  led  at  5/4.  Niles  and  Dabney 
brought  it  to  5-all,  only  to  have  the  set  captured  at  7/5,  principally  through 
their  errors.  The  end  was  in  sight,  and  Clothier  and  Gardner  lost  no  time 
in   pressing  their   advantage,   losing   only   the  second   and   fourth   games. 

The  final  round  was  reserved  for  Saturday  afternoon,  and  a  big  crowd 
assembled    to    watch   it. 

The  first  set  was  almost  a  farce.  Clothier  and  Williams  won  their  ser- 
vices and  then  thfe  Philadelphians  slumped.  Biddle  was  the  weak  member 
and  he  affected  his  partner  to  a  slight  extent.  They  got  but  one  other 
game  in  the  set.  Worse  was  to  come.  Williams'  service  was  broken 
through  and  the  opposing  pair  got  to  2/0.  At  s-all  Williams  and  Biddle 
made  a  stand  and  the  latter  showed  a  great  improvement.  At  5/6  and 
30/40  on  his  service,  Biddle  pulled  the  game  out  of  the  fire,  taking  advan- 
tage of  the  openings  made  by  Williams  and  scoring  on  hard,  well  placed 
smashes  and  drives.  Service  won  to  ii-all,  when  Gardner's  delivery  was 
broken  through;  and  Biddle  served  the  set  game,  scoring  the  winning  point 
on  a  drive  through  Gardner.  It  was  a  thrilling  set,  abounding  in  rallies, 
and   after    the    5/6   point,   Williams   and   Biddle    had   all   the   best   of   it. 

A_  stubborn  fight  for  the  third  set  ensued,  and  after  an  exchange  of 
services  the  score  was  games-all  to  6-all.  At  6/7  Williams  failed  to  win 
his  service,  and  the  loss  cost  the  set,  Gardner  passing  Williams  on  return 
of  the  latter's  service  for  the  final   point. 

Gardner's  service  was  broken  through  in  the  fourth  set,  and  then  the 
games  fluctuated  to  4-all.  At  0/30  Gardner  steadied  and  won  his  service 
after  a  snappy  rally  by  all  four  men.  Again  Williams  served  and  a  long 
deuce  battle  ensued.  Gardner  saved  the  game  by  a  pretty  drive  down  the 
alley  and  got  to  advantage  by  following  it  up  with  a  timely  smash.  Clothier 
drove  out  and  Biddle  netted  after  a  rally.  Williams'  first  service  was  a 
fault  and  he  netted  Clothier's  return  of  the  second  delivery,  the  set  and 
match  thus  going  to  Clothier  and  Gardner.    The  summaries:

WALLACE  F.  JOHNSON. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Middle  States  Championships 

The  twenty-eighth  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  Middle 
States  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Orange  Lawn  Tennis  Club.  South 
Orange,  N.  J.,  July  i  and  the  following  days.  Wallace  F.  Johnson,  victor 
in  the  tourney  of  1909.  came  back  to  prominence  by  winning  the  tourna- 
ment and  successfully  challenging  the  title  holder,  W.  M.  Hall,  whom  he 
defeated  in  a  five-set  match.  Johnson,  previous  to  taking  on  the  title 
holder,  had  defeated  A.  H.  Man,  Jr.  in  the  final  round  with  very  strong 
work,  which  wore  his  opponent  down  in  the  same  way  in  which  he  defeated 
the   title   holder. 

The  doubles  event  was  won  by  H.  H.  Hackett  and  L.  E.  Mahan,  who 
defeated  Holcombe  Ward  and  G.  H.  Miles  in  the  final  round,  in  straight 
sets.  In  the  first  round  Neal  Stevens  furnished  a  surprise  in  defeating 
C.  M.  Bull,  Jr.  in  a  close  match,  while  A.  H.  Man,  Jr.  emerged  the  victor 
in  a  three-set  match  with  B.  M.  Phillips.  The  feature  matches  in  the  third 
round  were  those  of  G.  A.  L.  Dionne  and  S.  H.  Voshell.  the  former  win- 
ning, 6/3,  0/6,  6/4,  and  the  one  in  which  W.  M.  Washburn  won  over 
Edgar  W.  Leonard,  6/4,  7/5.  In  the  fourth  round  Wallace  Johnson  tri- 
umphed  over   Dionne,  and   Watson  was  defeated   by  Man. 

The  semi-finals  brought  Ward  against  Johnson  and  Man  against  Wash- 
burn. Johnson  and  Man  came  through  chiefly  on  their  opponents'  errors, 
Johnson  being  the  only  one  of  the  four  who  played  his  usual  game.  The 
final  match  resulted  in  a  trying  contest,  in  which  Johnson  was  victorious, 
largely  through  greater  tournament  experience  and  his  ability  to  last  out  a 
long  battle. 

The  challenge  round  resulted  in  a  battle  of  endurance,  with  the  chal- 
lenger the  stronger  at  the  finish.  Hall  took  the  first  set  with  fast  serving 
and  accurate  placing,  but  not  without  Johnson  deucing  it  again  and  again, 
and  showing  better  form  than  earlier  in  the  tournament.  At  lo-all  Hall 
cut  in  and  won  the  set,  12/10.  Hall  continued  in  the  third,  leading  at 
4/3.  5/4-  At  this  stage  the  Philadelphian  spurted  and  stopped  Hall's 
streak.  Taking  the  set  at  7/5,  after  fierce  opposition,  he  continued  on  and 
annexed  the  fourth  easily.  Hall  won  the  the  eighth  game,  but  could  not 
take  Johnson's  service,  and  the  latter  won.. 

The  doubles  entry  list  showed  four  teams  which  seemed  to  outclass  the 
rest.  They  were  Clothier  and  G.  L.  Wrenn,  Jr.,  and  Ward  and  G.  H. 
Miles  in  the  upper  half,  and  Watson  and  Johnson  and  Hackett  and  Mahan 
in  the  lower  part.  The  final,  which  was  played  between  Ward  and  Miles 
and  Hackett  and  Mahan,  was  somewhat  disappointing.  The  latter  pair 
showed  a  brand  of  tennis  entirely  different  to  this  displayed  against  Wat- 
son and  Johnson,  making  but  few  errors  and  keeping  the  ball  constantly 
in  play.  As  a  consequence  the  match  was  a  short  one.  Ward  and  Miles  at 
no   time  breaking  through   their  opponents'  delivery.      The   summaries:

Meadville  Tennis  Club. — This  is  oue  of  the  most  active  organizations  in 
Pennsylvania  and  through  the  enthusiasm  of  President  Dewey  and  the  m;  m- 
bers,  the  club  is  always  well  represented.  As  a  result  of  the  tournament 
held  to  determine  the  teams  which  should  represei  ;  the  club  at  the  meeting 
of  the  lawn  Tennis  Association  of  Northwestern  Pennsylvania,  at  Oil  City 
during  the  first  week  of  August.  1912,  Messrs.  Trace,  Deutsch.  Doubet  and 
Dunbar  were  selected  to  reprtsent  Meadville  in  doubles,  and  M.  H.  and  A. 
J.  Dewey.  Doubet  and  Dunbar,  in  singles.  They  acquitted  themselves  very 
well,  considering  the  fact  that  it  was  the  first  match  of  this  kind  any  on<i 
of  them  had  ever  undertaken,  and  while  no  prizes  were  won,  the  piaycrs 
left  Oil  City  with  several  victories  to  their  credit.  At  the  annual  meeting 
of  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  of  Northwestern  Pennsylvania.  M.  H.  Dewey 
was  elected  vice-president,  which  was  certainly  an  honor  to  the  youngest 
member  of  that  body,  the  Meadville  club.  FolloAving  the  tournament,  the 
Oil  City  club  accepted  an  invitation  from  the  Meadville  club  for  an  inter- 
city match,  which  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Country  Club  at  Meadville. 
EFere,  too,  Meadville's  representatives.  Messrs.  Lewis.  Trace.  Burwell,  M.  H. 
and  A.  J.  Dewey,  were  successful  in  winning  four  of  the  six  matches  played. 
The  final  event  of  the  season  was  the  fall  tournament,  in  which  the  cham- 
pionship of  the  club  was  won  by  M.  H.  Dewey,  with  W.  D.  Lewis  runner-up. 
The  club  has  leased  a  plot  of  ground  for  a  terms  of  years  and.  with  the 
fine  new  courts  laid  out.  Meadville  will  certainly  be  heard  from  in  lawn 
tennis  circles   this  season. 

Sullivan  County  (N.  Y.)  Tournament.— During  the  week  of  August  12  tennis 
players  of  Sullivan  Coimty,  N.  Y.,  competed  for  the  singles  and  doubles 
titles  In  a  tournament  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Merriwold  Tennis  Club  of 
Merriwold,  N.  Y.  William  C.  deMille  shared  in  both  titles,  taking  the 
Angles  event  and  then  later,  paired  with  W.  J.  Clarke,  won  the  doubles. 
The  event  attracted  a  fair  sized  entry,  although  deMille  and  H.  E.  Colton 
were  easily  the  best  men.  They  met  in  the  final  round  and  the  former  won 
In   straight    sets,   after   being   forced    to    the    limit    in    the    opener. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Pacific  Coast  Championships 

For  the  second  time  Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  won  the  Pacific  Coast  cham- 
pionship at  Santa  Cruz,  Cal.,  June  24  to  29,  1912.  Melville  Long, 
McLoughlin's  only  dangerous  rival  in  the  tournament,  defaulted  the  final 
match  on  account  of  a  badly  strained  ankle.  Long  had  been  playing  his 
best  and  a   warm  final   was  anticipated. 

McLoughlin  met  only  one  man  worthy  of  his  steel,  namely,  Herbert 
Long,  and  he  disposed  of  him  in  the  semi-final  round,  6/3,  6/0.  The 
match  was  a  splendid  one.  Long  was  right  on  and  pounding  in  beautiful 
drives  he  forced  game  after  game  to  deuce,  and  led  at  40-love  and  40/15 
in  many.  McLoughlin  fought  him  back  in  every  pinch,  however,  and  did 
some   clever  volleying. 

The  best  tennis  of  the  tournament  was  in  the  doubles  for  the  Hotel 
Casa  del  Rey  cups.  C.  R.  Gardner  and  William  Johnston  came  through 
the  upper  half  of  the  draw,  playing  splendid  tennis,  and  defeating  such 
teams  as  McLoughlin  and  Havens,  6/1,  6/2,  and  Dr.  Sumner  Hardy  and 
Nat  Browne,  2/6,  6/2,  10/8.  This  latter  match  was  a  hummer,  being 
anybody's   contest    right   to   the   finish. 

Florence  Sutton  had  little  trouble  winning  the  women's  singles.  Mrs. 
Neimeyer  and  Miss  Baker  easily  won  the  women's  doubles.  Miss  Sutton's 
second  victory  came  in  the  mixed  doubles,  where,  partnered  with  Nat 
Browne,  she  won  a  runaway  match  in  the  final  from  Miss  Baker  and 
Reuben   Hunt.     The    summaries:

Pacific  Coast  Doubles 

By  the  narrowest  of  margins  Thomas  C.  Bundy  of  Los  Angeles,  and 
Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  of  San  Francisco,  again  won  the  doubles  cham- 
pionship of  the  Pacific  states  in  191 2.  If  their  victory  of  a  year  ago  was 
hard  earned,  their  latest  one  was  trebly  so,  and  only  the  most  desperate 
kind  of  uphill  fighting  pulled  them  out  on  top  in  the  final  match.  William 
Johnston  and  Elia  Fottrell,  both  of  San  Francisco,  and  aged  17  and  19 
years,  respectively,  were  their  opponents  in  the  grand  climax  of  the  tour- 
nament, and  the  battle  they  put  up  will  remain  in  the  memories  of  those 
who  witnessed  it  for  many  a  long  day.  The  tournament  was  held  at 
Beverly  Hills,  near  Los  Angeles,  on  the  courts  of  the  Los  Angeles  Coun- 
try Club,  instead  of  at  Long  Beach  as  has  been  the  custom,  and  the 
change   proved   a  very   commendable   one. 

Thirty-eight  teams  entered  the  event,  breaking  all  records  for  doubles 
tournaments  in  California,  and  only  seven  defaults  were  chalked  up.  Play 
began  on  July  4,  and  the  tournament  ended  on  July  6.  No  less  than 
eight  five-set  matches  were  played  and  four  of  those  were  between  teams 
of  the  very  first  rank;  so  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  it  was  not  only  the 
largest   but   the   hottest   doubles   championship   ever   held   on   the   coast. 

Those  who  bewailed  the  fact  that  such  players  as  Bundy  and  McLough- 
lin should  be  pitted  against  so  young  and  inexperienced  a  couple  as 
Johnston  and  Fottrell  in  the  final,  had  the  surprise  of  their  lives,  when 
the  match  that  promised  to  be  an  anti-climax  turned  out  a  real  hair- 
raising  climax.  ,        tt      r        , 

Johnston  was  the  brilliant  light  of  the  match.  He  fought  a  clean  and 
gritty  fight  all  the  way,  and  gained  a  host  of  admirers.  McLoughlin, 
though  never  at  his  best  for  long  periods,  was  next  to  Johnston,  with 
Bundy  third.  Fottrell  played  well,  but  his  work  was  slightly  inferior  to 
Bundy's  in  point  of  execution  and  distinctly  so  in  headwork.  Had  he  been 
more  severe  at  volleying  and  smashing  it  might  have  been  a  different 
story.      His   serving    was   excellent.      The   summaries:

Central  California  Championship.— Maurice  E.  MeLoughlin  won  the  Central 
California  championship,  as  he  did  last  year,  but  William  Johnston,  the 
young  -'cumer,"  of  ?an  Francisco,  created  the  biggest  stir  in  the  tournament. 
McLoughlin  was  only  called  on  to  play  a  match  and  a  half  in  the  singles. 
He  defeated  Cassell  ten  straight  games  in  the  first  round  and  then  the  latter 
defaulted.  Gardner  then  scratched  to  him,  and  he  won  an  easy  victory  from 
Herbert  Long  in  the  semi-final  at  6/1,  6/2.  "Mac"  played  well  "in  this  match, 
and  Long  really  got  little  chance  to  strike  any  gait.  Johnston,  who  had 
reached  the  final  of  the  other  half  after  sterling  play,  defaulted  the  final 
match  to  McLoughlin.  as  he  had  four  other  matches  to  play  that  day,  three 
of  which  were  final  ones.  .lohnston  and  C.  R.  Gardner  won  the  championship 
doubles,  defeating  the  Long  brothers  in  the  final  round.  Johnston  and  Gard- 
ner teamed  up  well,  and  the  clever  driving  and  over-head  work  of  the  young- 
ster were  large  factors  in  the  victory.  Gardner  was  very  bad  in  the  first 
set,  and.  like  the  Longs,  was  never  on  his  game  in  the  match.  Johnston  and 
Gardner  won  at  2/6.  6/1,  6/4.  Miss  Florence  Sutton,  who  came  from  Los 
Angeles  with  Miss  Mary  Browne  and  her  brother  "Nat,"  won  the  women's 
singles.  In  the  final  she  took  revenge  from  Miss  Browne  for  the  straight  set 
defeat  the  latter  had  given  her  at  Ojai.  and  won  the  match,  8/6,  6/3.  The 
mixed  doubles  went  to  the  Browne  family.  In  the  final  they  took  a  straight 
set   match   from   Miss  Sutton  and  Dr.    Summer   Hardy,   7/5,   6/3.

New  England  Championship 

The  dirt  courts  of  the  Hartford  Golf  Club  was  the  scene  of  the  cham- 
pionship tournament  of  New  England,  June  4  to  8.  The  competition  is 
one  of  the  oldest  district  championships,  having  been  an  annual  fixture, 
with   one   exception,   since    1886. 

F.  H.  Harris,  former  New  England  intercollegiate  title  holder,  captured 
the  honors  after  some  brilliant  playing,  in  which  he  defeated  several  well 
know^n  New  England  players,  including  Fred  C.  Inman  of  New  York,  in 
the  final  round,  and  won  the  challenge  round  by  the  default  of  R.  A. 
Kolden,  Jr. 

The  doubles  were  productive  of  a  number  of  upsets,  and  in  the  finals 
some  of  the  best  play  of  the  tournament  was  exhibited.  Man  and  Peaselee, 
the  ultimate  winners,  forged  ahead  in  the  fifth  set  and  won  the  final  round 
from   Harris  and   Currier.      The  summaries:

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


Southern   Championship 

The  courts  of  the  Atlanta  Athletic  Club  of  Atlanta,  Ga.,  were  the  scene 
of  the  Southern  Championships  in  singles  and  doubles  during  the  week  of 
July  I.  The  events  in  the  three  preceding  years  were  won  by  Easterners, 
owing  to  the  lack  of  Southern  entrants,  but  the  1912  tournament  mustered 
a  good  number  of  Southern  players,  with  the  result  that  the  Southern 
supremacy   was  largely   in  doubt. 

Carleton  Y.  Smith  of  Atlanta  proved  his  superiority  over  the  field  by 
coming  through  the  singles  without  the  loss  of  a  single  set,  although  he 
was  hard  pressed  in  the  third  round  by  Nat  Thornton,  former  Southern 
champion,  in  the  first  set  of  their  match,  which  went  7/5  in  Smith's  favor. 
C.  Doyle  of  Washington  did  not  defend  his  title,  so  that  Smith  won  by 
default  in  ^he   challenge   round. 

In  the  doubles  Smith,  who  was  paired  with  Thornton,  duplicated  his 
performance  of  the  singles  by  winning  the  tournament  without  the  loss 
of  a  set.     The   summaries:

being  partnered  in  the  latter  event  with  Warren  Magruder.  The  doubles  vic-

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  73 


Metropolitan   Championship 

Beginning  on  June  15  and  ending  on  the  following  Saturday,  the  grass 
courts  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  of  New  York  City  were  the  scene 
of   the    Metropolitan   championships   in    singles   and    doubles. 

The  semi-finals  brought  Little  against  Andrews,  and  Dabney  against 
Watson.  The  former  match  was  a  great  disappointment.  Andrews,  play- 
ing his  usual  back-court  game,  could  not  develop  enough  speed  to  become 
dangerous  to  his  opponent  at  any  time,  and  only  in  the  third  set  was 
anything  like  a  contest  developed.  Little,  however,  always  had  the  neces- 
sary punch  and  won,  with  plenty  to  spare.  The  other  match  developed 
into  an  excellent  exhibition  of  back-line  work,  with  Dabney  always  on  top. 
This  was  due  largely  to  Watson's  weak  back-hand.  Dabney  took  the  first 
set  at  6/4;  the  second  was  a  little  harder,  7/5,  and  in  the  third  Watson 
pulled   up  to  6-all   before  losing  the  next   two  games  and   the  match. 

The  final  was  played  on  Saturday  before  the  largest  gallery  of  the  tour- 
nament, fully  a  thousand  spectators  being  present.  The  match,  however, 
was  disappointing,  as  Little  was  playing  the  same  fine  game  he  had  shown 
all  through  the  week  and  never  gave  Dabney  a  chance,  outclassing  him  in 
every   department   of  the  game  except   service. 

The  doubles  event  was  just  the  reverse  to  the  singles  and  increased  with 
interest  as  each  set  progressed.  It  wound  up  with  a  wonderful  five-set 
match  between  Hall  and  Hackett,  who  had  paired  together  for  the  first 
time,  and  Little  and  Touchard,  with  the  former  two  winning  after  having 
lost  their  first  two  sets.  This  match  was  preceded  by  an  almost  equally 
exciting  one  in  the  semi-final,  in  which  Hackett  and  Hall  lost  their  first 
two  sets  to  George  L.  Wrenn,  Jr.,  and  C.  F.  Watson.  They  made  a  won- 
derful recovery  and  scored  a  decisive  victory.      The   summaries:

Southampton  Tournament 

Nat.  W.  Niles  was  the  star  performer  in  the  invitation  tournament 
decided  on  the  courts  of  the  Meadow  Club,  Southampton,  L.  I.,  during  the 
week  of  August  12,  1912,  coming  through  to  the  top  honors  in  the  singles 
event.  Niles  won  by  victories  over  Craig  Biddle,  T.  C.  Bundy,  F.  C.  Col- 
ston, E.  P.  Larned  and  W.  F.  Johnson.  He  was  not  in  his  best  form, 
however,  and  he  dropped  a  set  each  to  Biddle,  Larned,  Bundy  and  John- 
son, but  in  Colston  he  defeated  his  opponent  not  only  setless,  but  gameless, 
an  unusual   happening.  / 

In  the  final  round  for  the  doubles  event  McLoughlin  and  Bundy  won 
over  Gardner  and  Clothier,  6/4,  6/2,  6/4.  In  this  round  McLoughlin  and 
Gardner  were  the  spectacular  players,  while  Bundy  and  Clothier  were 
steady  and  dependable,  with  occasional  leaps  into  the  limelight.  The  first 
set  was  close,  but  the  Californians  always  had  a  little  in  reserve,  and  they 
won   out.      The   summaries:

Seabri^ht  Tournament 

By  a  notable  victory  over  M.  H.  Long,  the  defender  of  the  singles,  Nat. 
W.  Niles  scored  his  second  leg  on  the  historic  Achelis  Challenge  Cup  in 
the  Seabright,  N.  J.,  invitation  tournament,  held  during  the  week  of 
July  8.  It  was  one  of  the  most  important  grass  matches  of  the  early  sea- 
son. The  cup  has  been  in  competition  for  many  years,  now  bearing  the 
names  of  such  well  known  players  as  Beals  Wright,  W.  A".  Larned,  R.  D. 
Little,  F.   B,  Alexander,  W.  J.  Clothier  and  M.  H.   Long. 

That  the  victory  was  no  hollow  one  was  evidenced  by  Long's  wins  over 
Karl  Behr  and  Clothier,  which  were  due  to  sound,  consistent  and  brilliant 
racquet  wielding. 

The  doubles  was  won  by  Harold  H.  Hackett  and  Lyle  E.  Mahan,  who 
lost  a  set  to  W.  A.  Larned  and  R.  B.  Wrenn  and  were  forced  to  a  four- 
set  match   with   Behr  and   F.  C.  Inman. 

In  addition  to  getting  his  second  leg  on  the  Achelis  Cup,  Niles  won  out- 
right the  cup  presented  by  John  Harsen  Rhoades,  while  Hackett  and  Mahan 
became  possessors  of  the  cups  presented  by  H.  L.  Crawford  and  J.  H. 
Barrows.  Changes  in  the  matches  as  well  as  in  the  pairing  of  the  doubles 
teams  was  caused  by  the  absence  or  withdrawal  of  several  players.  Those 
who  did  not  play  were  W.  A.  Larned,  R.  N.  Williams,  Jr.,  E.  P.  Larned, 
R.  D.  Little,  Richard  Stevens,  G.  F.  Touchard  and  E.  W.  Leonard  in  the 
singles,  while  the  absence  of  Beals  Wright  broke  up  the  Wright-Behr  team 
for  the  doubles.     The  summaries:

State  Championships 

New  York  State  Championship 

The  grass  courts  of  the  Crescent  Athletic  Club,  at  Bay  Ridge,  Brooklyn, 
were  again  the  scene  of  the  annual  New  York  State  championships  for 
1912,  which  were  held  August  i   to   10. 

Maurice  E.  McLoughlin,  the  young  Californian,  continued  his  winning 
streak  when  by  winning  the  New  York  State  title  annexed  his  third  sin- 
gles title  in  as  many  weeks,  in  addition  to  being  a  participant  in  two 
doubles    championship    pairs. 

In  the  singles,  after  winning  the  first  set  with  the  greatest  ease,  and 
seeming  to  have  the  third  within  his  grasp,  McLoughlin  was  halted  when 
Williams  found  himself,  and  for  two  sets  the  latter  exhibited  a  burst  of 
speed  that  almost  carried  the  Californian  off  his  feet.  Had  it  not  been  for 
his  all  too  frequent  errors,  and  especially  his  double-faults,  of  which  he 
made    21    in    the    match,    Williams    would   almost    certainly    have    won. 

Equally  spectacular  and  enthusiasm-arousing  was  the  doubles  event.  It 
witnessed  the  straight-set  defeat  of  Little  and  Touchard,  the  national  dou- 
bles champions,  by  McLoughlin  and  Bundy,  a  defeat  preceded  by  a  similar 
happening  when  the  Californians  met  Harold  H.  Hackett  and  R.  N. 
Williams,    Jr. 

McLoughlin  was  slow  to  get  going  in  his  match  with  Mahan,  and  was 
careless  in  all  his  strokes.  Nor  was  his  service  as  effective  as  usual.  As 
a  result  Mahan  scored  four  games  in  the  first  set.  His  long  reach  enabled 
him  to  cover  the  net  well,  particularly  when  his  opponent's  drives  lacked 
their    customary    sting. 

Considerable  wind  prevailed  when  the  semi-finals  were  played,  McLough- 
lin metting  Bundy  in  the  upper  half,  and  Williams  facing  Hall  in  the 
lower.  In  the  latter  match  Williams  was  always  the  master;  he  made 
quite  a  few  mistakes,  but   Hall  was  helpless  before  the  shots  that  went  in. 

Bundy  started  service  against  McLoughlin  and  lost  a  long  deuce  game. 
After  that  games  went  with  the  service  to  4/3,  when  Bundy  broke  through 
and  made  the  score  4-all.  Up  to  this  time  it  was  a  very  even  thing,  but 
thereafter    McLoughlin    improved    while    Bundy    went    off    correspondingly. 

McLoughlin  started  quickly  in  the  second  set  and  soon  got  to  3/0. 
Bundy  go^  the  fourth  game,  but  it  was  his  only  tally  in  the  set.  The 
third    set    was   a    repetition    of    the    second,    and    the    score    was    the    same. 

A  bright,  sunny,  but  very  windy  day  was  Saturday,  when  McLoughlin 
and  Williams  came  on  the  court  for  the  final  round.  The  latter  began 
serving  and  promptly  lost  the  opener,  two  double-faults  contributing  mate- 
rially. The  wind  seemed  to  bother  him  and  the  majority  of  his  shots  went 
very  wild.  He  won  the  third  and  fifth  games,  but  that  was  all  he  got  in 
the  set.  McLoughlin  was  playing  good  tennis  and  profiting  by  Williams' 
many  errors.  Williams  won  his  opening  service  in  the  next  set  after  con- 
siderable trouble.  But  he  then  stopped  short  and  McLoughlin  won  five 
games  in  a  row.  It  was  the  same  story — wildness  on  Williams'  part  and 
good,  stark  blows  by  the  Californian.  Williams  earned  the  seventh  game, 
but  lost  the  eighth  and  the  set. 

Williams  led  at  3/2  in  the  third  set.  Two  service  aces  in  succession 
helped  McLoughlin "  win  the  sixth  game;  the  latter  had  his  chance  in  the 
seventh,  needing  but  one  point  to  break  through  and  lead  at  4/3  and  his 
own  service  to  follow.  The  match  seemed  over,  but  Williams  came  to  life 
at  this  precise  moment  and  began  the  brilliant  attack  that  almost  carried 
him  to  victory.     His  shots  had  been  going  out  by  smaller  margins  and  now 


84  SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

they  began  to  go  in.  At  15/40  he  came  to  the  net  and  vollied  across  court 
beautifully;  McLoughlin  drove  out,  but  got  to  advantage  on  Williams' 
drive  that  just  missed  being  good.  Williams  crossed  the  return  of  service 
for  a  clean  ace,  and  McLoughlin  needed  a  difficult  service;  Williams  then 
came  to  the  net  and  vollied  the  return  of  service  across  court  for  the 
point  and  game.  The  Calif ornian  won  his  own  service  and  made  the  score 
4-alI.  Service  won  to  6/5,  and  then  Williams  broke  through  for  the  game 
and  set,  after  McLoughlin  led  at  30/0  and  40/30.  The  last  point  was 
Williams',  who  just  got  a  shot  to  the  side  line  and  drove  it  across  court 
with  irresistible  speed. 

The  tide  had  turned  so  quickly  that  the  crowd  could  scarcely  believe  it 
had  turned.  Neither  man  wanted  a  rest,  so  the  fourth  set  was  started. 
Williams  won  his  service  at  love,  but  McLoughlin  won  his  own  service  and 
then  broke  through  Williams,  thus  leading  at  2/1,  and  then  got  to  3/1. 
Williams  retaliated  in  the  sixth  game  after  he  was  behind  at  0/30.  Win- 
ning his  own  service,  Williams  again  broke  through  in  the  eighth  game 
after  McLoughlin  led  at  30/0.  The  play  was  very  spirited  and  fine  here, 
both  men  going  at  top  speed,  but  Williams  having  slightly  the  best  of  it. 
He  defeated  McLoughlin  repeatedly  with  hard,  well  placed  drives. 
McLoughlin  broke  through  in  the  ninth  game,  bringing  him  to  4/5,  but 
Williams  returned  the  compliment,  hitting  the  service  for  an  ace  and  pass- 
ing beautifully;  the  last  point  went  to  him  on  a  double-fault  by  McLough- 
lin. This  was  clearly  Williams'  set.  His  spectacular  shots  set  the  crowd 
to   cheering  wildly,  and   he   had   McLoughlin   guessing  time   after  time. 

Williams  won  his  own  service  in  the  fifth  set  and  then  captured 
McLoughlin's.  With  his  own  to  follow  it  seemed  as  if  it  were  all  over  but 
the  shouting.  He  got  to  30/15  in  the  third  game,  but  netted,  missed  an 
easy  volley  and  had  a  ball  driven  to  his  feet  by  McLoughlin.  the  latter 
thus  breaking  through.  This  was  the  turning  point,  for  it  gave  McLough- 
lin renewed  confidence  and  shook  that  of  Williams,  who  had  been  going 
great  guns  for  the  two  whole  sets.  At  3-all  Williams  lobbed  out,  double- 
faulted,  was  defeated  by  a  cross  volley,  profited  by  McLoughlin's  drive 
out,  vollied  at  the  net  for  the  point,  and  then  double-faulted  again  for  the 
loss  of  the  game.  Service  won  to  5/4  (McLoughlin  leading)  and  the 
latter  won  his  own  service  and  with  it  the  set  and  match. 

McLoughlin's  victory,  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  stroke  analysis,  was 
one  of  the  strangest  ever  won.  The  total  of  points  scored  was:  McLough- 
lin, 162;  Williams,  150;  of  his  162  points  McLoughlin  obtained  no  less 
than  21  through  his  opponent's  double-faults,  as  compared  with  the  5  which 
Williams  got  from  McLoughlin's  double-faults,  a  difference  of  16,  which  is 
greater  than  the  difference  in  the  totals.  A  glance  at  these  figures  gives 
good  ground  for  those  who  said  that  Williams'  double-faulting  cost  him  the 
match.  Williams  outplaced  his  conquerer,  55  to  29,  or,  counting  service 
aces,  62  to  43.  His  errors  numbered  119  to  McLoughlin's  88,  counting 
double-faults  among  errors.  If  one  were  to  make  a  percentage  of  the  pro- 
portion of  earned  points  to  errors,  the  defeated  player  would  have  the 
better  of  it,   with  34.2   per  cent.,  as  against   32.8   per  cent. 

Special  interest  was  taken  in  the  doubles  event  because  of  the  presence 
of  the  two  teams  which,  later  in  the  month,  played  for  the  national  title 
at  Newport — Bundy  and  McLoughlin,  the  challengers,  and  Little  and 
Touchard,  the  present  champions.  Their  meeting,  therefore,  was  in  the 
nature  of  a  skirmish  before  a  battle,  and  threw  light  on  the  strength  and 
weakness  of  each  pair.  The  engagement  took  place  in  the  second  round 
played  on  Wednesday,  and  proved  somewhat  disappointing  on  account  of 
the  ease  with  which  Bundy  and  McLoughlin  won.  At  no  time  were  they 
at  a  loss  what  to  do,  or  how  to  do  it,  and  took  the  sets,  6/3,  d/i.  These 
rivals  disposed  of,  it  became  apparent  that  Bundy  and  McLoughlin  would 
capture  the  title,  and  the  event  did  not  disprove  predictions.  The  sum- 
maries:

Alrick  H.  Man,  Jr.,  Richmond  Hill,  L.  I.,  by  his  defeat  of  Vanderbilt 
B.  Ward  in  a  closely  contested  five-set  match,  won  the  New  Jersey  State 
championship  in  singles  in  the  tourney  held  at  the  Morristown  Field  Club, 
Morristown,  during  the  week  of  September  9.  Ward  had  defeated  Charles 
M.  Bull  and  the  latter  in   turn  disposed  of  C.  F.  Watson,  Jr. 

The  doubles  went  to  Watson  and  C.  R.  Leonard,  who  triumphed  over 
Ward  and  Dr.  William  Rosenbaum  in  a  three-set  match  on  Tuesday,  Sep- 
tember 17.  This  event  could  not  be  reached  in  time  to  play  on  the  previous

Virginia  State  Championship 

Showing  greatly  improved  form,  Nat.  Bundy  sprang  a  surprise  when 
he  defeated,  in  succession,  J.  S.  Taylor,  J.  H.  Winston  and  Hugh  G.  White- 
head in  the  Virginia  State  Championships,  held  at  the  Norfolk  Country

In  the  doubles  event  Bundy,  paired  with  C.  F.  Mcintosh,  won  the  event 
and  challenged  the  champions,  Winston  and  Whitehead.  The  veteran 
pair  were  too  good,  however,  and  although  they  dropped  the  first  set  at 
6/2,  they  pulled  themselves  together  and  won  the  next  three.  The  last 
set  was  hard  fought,  Winston  and  Whitehead  finally  getting  it  at  7/5.

Delaware  State  Championship 

The  seventh  annual  Delaware  Championships  were  held  on  the  grass 
courts  of  the  Wilmington  Country  Club,  commencing  June  24  and  continu- 
ing for  a  week.  But  for  the  fine  brand  of  tennis  displayed  by  Dean  Mathey, 
the  former  Princeton  star,  Wallace  Johnson  would  once  more  have  captured 
the  title,  on   which    for  a   time    he   appeared    to    have   a   mortgage.     But  the 


92  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

clever  young  racquet  wielder  of  New  Jersey  came  forth  at  the  right  time 
and  took  away  the  honors,  after  Johnson  had  disposed  of  F.   C.   Inman. 

The  two  men  met  in  the  final  round,  and  a  five-set  match  resulted.  It 
provided  some  great  sport  for  the  large  gallery,  and  resulted  in  a  win  for 
Mathey,  the  last  set  going  to  8/6.  As  Carlton  R.  Gardner,  last  year's 
winner,    did    not   defend,    Mathey   took    the    title    by    default. 

F.  C.  Inman  and  Artemus  Holmes  of  New  York  successfully  defended 
in  the  doubles  by  disposing  of  H.  M.  Tilden-  and  A.  D.  Thayer,  Jr.  The 
winners  dropped  the  first  set  at  6/4  and  the  fourth  at  6/3,  but  managed 
to  show  just  enough  reserve    to    pull    out    the    victory.     The    summaries:

Pennsylvania  State  Championship 

The  Pennsylvania  State  Championship  was  decided  on  the  courts  of  the 
Merion  Cricket  Club,  Haverford,  Pa.,  June  3,  with  a  record-breaking  entry 
list.  In  the  singles  there  were  forty-nine  entrants  and  twenty  pairs  in  the 
doubles.  The  sensation  of  the  tournament  was  the  brilliant  work  of 
Kichard  Norris  Williams,  Jr.  |ie  won  the  singles  title  by  disposing  of 
Percy  Siverd  of  Pittsburgh,  the  title  holder,  whom  he  dispatched  in  the 
final   round,   6/1,   6/1,   6/1. 

There  was  very  little  class  displayed  in  the  doubles  event.  The  chal- 
lenge round,  which  was  played  on  Monday  between  Wallace  Johnson  and 
George  Brooke,  challengers,  and  Herbert  Tilden  and  Alexander  Thayer, 
holders,  was  about  the  poorest  exhibition  ever  witnessed  in  a  challenge 
round  of  this  event.  Johnson  and  Brown  finally  wrested  the  title  from 
the  holders.      The  summaries:

Ohio  State  Championship 


The  sixteenth  annual  Ohio  State  championships  were  held  on  the  clay 
courts  of  the  East  End  Tennis  Club  at  Cleveland,  beginning  September  9 
and  ending  on  the  following  Saturday.  In  the  men's  singles  the  tourna- 
ment winner  turned  up  in  the  person  of  John  G.  Nelson  of  Concord,  N.  H., 
and  Dartmouth  College,  and  he  succumbed  only  to  his  former  teammate, 
Fred    H.    Harris   of    Boston,   in    the   championship  round,    6/2,    6/3,   6/1. 

In  the  doubles  this  pair  swept  through  the  entire  tournament  and  won 
the  challenge  round  by  default  from  Nat  Thornton  and  Frank  C.  Marty, 
the   latter   being  unable    to   get   over  from    Cleveland. 

The  most  brilliant   match   of  the   tournament  occurred  when   Benton   and 


96  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

Pettee  met  Holden  and  Emerson,  the  Tri-State  champions,  in  the  lower  half 
of  the  double.  The  match  went  the  limit  of  the  full  five  sets.  Brilliant 
net  play  was  shown  on  both  sides  and  the  angles  put  on  the  ball  were  a 
caution.  Rally  followed  rally,  and  with  the  score  3/3  in  the  fifth  set  it 
seemed  anybody's  match.  Double  faults  by  Benton  when  his  team  had  a 
lead  of  40/15  on  the  next  game  and  a  chance  to  kill  netted  by  Pettee, 
proved  costly,  and  the  game  went  to  Holden  and  Emerson,  as  also  the 
next.  Benton  and  Pettee  staved  off  defeat  by  winning  the  next  game, 
but   lost   the   following  and   the  set,   6/4. 

In  the  women's  events  the  two  Canadians,  Miss  Lois  Moyes  and  Miss 
Rhea  Fairbairn,  proved  too  much  for  the  local  players.     The  summaries:

98  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Rhode  Island  State  Championship 

The  victory  of  Deals  C.  Wright,  the  first  non-resident  to  annex  the  title 
of  singles  champion  of  Rhode  Island,  was  without  precedent  in  the  twenty- 
five  years  of  the  event.  The  competition  took  place  on  the  courts  of  the 
Agawam  Hunt,  Providence,  beginning  August  3,  in  which  sixty-four 
entrants  were  in  the  lists,  eleven  of  which  defaulted.  In  the  course  of 
events  Wright  eliminated  J.  D.  E.  Jones,  who  had  held  the  State  title, 
while  A.  T.  Kennedy,  Jr.,  of  Philadelphia,  became  the  runner-up.  On  the 
final  day  of  the  tournament  Wright  and  Kennedy  clashed  for  possession  of 
the  State  title.  In  contrast  to  the  masterful  form  of  Wright,  which  was 
little  short  of  perfection,  the  overhead  work  of  the  runner-up  was 
ineffective  and  at  times  seriously  at  fault,  and,  though  his  ground  strokes 
were  generally  good,  and  in  the  first  two  sets  he  outshone  the  former 
nationalist  in  the  scoring  of  aces  on  well-placed  returns,  he  fell  down 
unfortunate  in   the  control   of  his  shots. 

J.  D.  E.  Jones  and  Stanley  Henshaw,  both  Rhode  Islanders,  repelled  a 
strong  invading  contingent  in  the  doubles  championship.  The  competition 
was  held  on  the  turf  courts  of  the  Agawam  Hunt,  East  Providence,  begin- 
ning September  7.  The  victory  of  the  winners  was  their  third  win  for 
the  'event. 

The  opening  of  the  entry  list  resulted  in  the  coming  of  a  strong  aggre- 
gation of  players  from  Massachusetts,  the  most  notable  of  them  being 
Sydney  L.  Beals  and  Henry  R.  Scott  of  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club  of 
Boston,  who  came  through  the  final  round,  only  to  go  down  to  defeat 
before  Jones  and  Henshaw  after  a  hard  struggle.     The  summaries:

West  Virginia   State   Championship 

The  seventh  annual  invitation  tennis  tournament  for  the  championship 
of  West  Virginia  began  on  August  19,  on  the  four  clay  courts  of  the 
Farkersburg  Country  Club.  The  unusual  number  of  out-of-town  visitors 
present,  the  large  entry  list,  sterling  tennis,  coupled  with  the  enthusiasm 
shown  by  the  players  and  spectators,  helped  to  make  the  tournament  the 
most   successful   that   has  yet   been   held.  Wheeling  and   Fairmont   carried 

off  the  honors,  as  the  former  city  furnished  the  successful  team  in  dou- 
bles, Cummins  and  Bowie,  who  by  consistent  and  clever  play  went 
through  the  tournament,  winning  the  title,  while  the  latter  city  again  fur- 
nished the  champion  in  singles,  Everett  Drennen,  who  by  his  finished  and 
aggressive  play  successfully  defended  his  title  in  the  challenge  round 
against  the  attack  ,of  Tom  Cummins  of  Wheeling,  who  by  splendid  play 
had  won  his  way  to  the  final.     The   summaries:

Florida  State  Championship 

The  annual  championship  tournament  for  the  State  of  Florida  in  singles 
and  doubles  began  on  the  courts  of  the  Palm  Beach  Tennis  Club,  March  i. 
The  entry  lists  of  both  events  were  well  filled,  with  some  of  the  most 
prominent  players  of  the  country  participating.  In  the  singles  event  Percy 
Siverd  of  Pittsburgh,  the  title  holder,  was  forcod  to  relinquish  the  crown 
to  T.  R.  Pell  in  the  challenge  round,  after  the  match  was  stopped  on  the 
first  day,   due  to   Siverd  being  seized   with   cramps   on   the   court. 

The  doubles  match  was  captured  by  Fred  C.  Inman  and  Harold  H. 
Hackett,  who  defeated  Percy  D.  Siverd  and  J.  L.  Cote  in  what  was  con- 
sidered the  best  doubles  matches  ever  witnessed  at  Palm  Beach.  The 
Hackett-Inman  victory  was  due  to  the  unusual  steadiness  of  the  pair,  while 
they   wore  down   their    opponents. 

Three  metropolitan  experts  got  into  the  semi-final  brackets.  F.  C.  Inman 
opposed  J.  L.  Cote  of  Pittsburgh  and  B.  S.  Prentice  was  scheduled  to  con- 
test with  T.  R.  Pell.  The  last  named  and  Inman  remained  to  fight  it  out 
for  the   privilege   of  playing  the  challenge   round.      Inman   played    his   usual 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  IO3 

eteady  game,  but  Pell  was  also  at  his  best,  with  the  result  that  he  annexed 
the  victory.  Five  full  sets  were  required  before  Pell  won,  and  the  con- 
test contained  many  brilliant  strokes,  long  rallies  and  remarkable  playing.

By  losing  in  the  challenge  round.  Richard  H.  Doughty,  formerly  ef 
New  York,  but  now  residing  in  Detroit,  to  Charles  O.  Benton  of  Cleve- 
land, the  title  of  singles  champion  of  Michigan  reverted  to  its  former 
owner.  Benton  lost  the  crown  in  191 1,  but  came  back  strong,  defeating 
Doughty,  6/4,  6/3,  4/6,  6/3.  The  tournament  was  for  the  Michigan  State 
championships,  played  August  5.  The  singles  brought  out  forty-three 
entries,  and  the  play  was  generally  good,  although  Benton  was  by  far  the 
best  of  the  field.  The  doubles  were  won  by  Benton  and  Philip  Miller  of 
Decatur,  111.,  a  steady  and  careful  left-handed  player,  who  teamed  well 
with  the  singles  champion.  The  singles  consolation  event  was  won  by

Vermont  State  Championship 

The  twelfth  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Vermont  was 
held  from  August  6  to  10,  on  the  clay  courts  of  the  Old  Pine  Golf  Club, 
at  St.  Johnsbury,  Vt.  John  G.  Nelson,  the  Dartmouth  collegian,  wrested 
the  singles  title  from  his  college  predecessor,  Fred  H.  Harris,  in  a  long, 
drawn-out  engagement,   while  the   doubles  title   went  to  the   two  as   a  team. 

Throughout  the  tournament,  there  had  been  much  comment  upon  the 
improvement  in  Nelson's  game.  It  was  not  thought,  however,  that  he  had 
developed  enough  power  to  defeat  the  titleholder,  Harris,  who  had  repeat- 
edly defeated  him.  In  the  first  set  of  the  challenge  round  Harris  ran  to 
a  5/2  lead  before  Nelson  began  to  get  going.  Nelson  then  brought  the 
score  to  5/4;  in  the  tenth  game  he  met  with  no  less  than  four  bad  bounds, 
and  even  then  yielded  it  only  after  twenty  points  had  been  played.  The 
second  set  went  to  Harris  at  6/2.  In  the  third  Nelson  got  a  good  start, 
and  ran  it  out  at  6/3.     The  summaries:

Texas  State  Championship 

Semp  Russ  retained  his  title  in  the  singles,  which  he  won  the  year 
"before,  and  then  later,  paired  with  Walthall,  won  the  doubles  by  defeating 
Stacey  and  Boggs  in  straight  sets,  after  the  first  one  had  gone  to  deuce 
in  the  Texas  State  championships,  held  on  the  courts  of  the  University 
of   Texas,   Austin,    May   27    to    31. 

The  tournament  was  held  under  ideal  conditions.  The  University  courts 
were  excellent,  the  weather  perfect,  and  the  matches  run  off  promptly. 
The  younger  element  was  much  in  evidence,  and  although  they  were 
■defeated  for  the  honors  in  the  two  principal  matches  they  managed  to 
reach  the  semi-finals.     The  summaries:

Illinois  State  Championship 

History  was  repeated  in  Chicago  when,  in  the  tenth  annual  tournament 
for  the  Illinois  State  Championship,  Walter  T.  Hayes  for  the  third  suc- 
cessive year  defeated  Albrecht  Ludke  in  the  championship  round,  while 
Miss  Carrie  B.  Neely  again  vanquished  her  old-time  rival,  Miss  Miriam 
Steever. 

The  tournament,  beginning  July  6,  was  held  as  usual  on  the  courts  of 
the  Aztec  Tennis  Club,  and  was  the  largest  in  point  of  entries  ever 
played  for  the  state  title.  In  all  ninety-seven  players  participated  in  the 
men's   singles,   while    the    entry   in   the    other   events    was   relatively    large. 

In  the  first  round  the  best  match  by  far  was  that  in  which  Edward 
Spear  of  the  Aztec  club  defeated  John  T.  Bailey,  the  veteran  Oklahoma 
State  champion.  In  the  second  round  Walter  T.  Hayes,  the  champion, 
who  played  through  the  tournament  for  the  first  time  in  four  years,  met 
William  Wilkens,  who,  however,  failed  to  show  his  best  tennis,  and  Hayes 
took   the   match   in    straight   sets. 

Possibly  the  greatest  surprise  of  the  tournament,  however,  came  in  the 
third  round,  when  Alex.  Squair,  the  University  of  Chicago  charnpion, 
defeated  J.  H.  Winston,  former  holder  of  the  Southern  championship,  in 
straight  sets. 

In  the  men's  doubles  the  entry,  though  unusually  large,  was  hardly  up 
to   the    standard   of    previous   years.      For   the    most   part   the   matches   were 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  HI 

unimportant,  until  the  third  round,  when  Byford  and  Ludke  met  Forstall 
and  Herd  in  what  proved  to  be  the  best  match  of  the  week.  All  four 
sets  of  this  contest  were  replete  with  brilliant  tennis,  Ludke  and  Byford 
winning.     Tae   summaries:

Minnesota  State  Championship 

Tennis  players  who  participated  in  the  eleventh  annual  tournament  for 
the  Minnesota  State  championship,  on  the  courts  of  the  Minikahda  Club 
of  Minneapolis,  beginning  August  10,  enjoyed  the  most  successful  tourna- 
ment ever  held  in  Minesota.  More  than  one  hundred  and  sixty  different 
players  actually   competed   in   the   various   events. 

John  W.  Adams  of  St.  Paul,  state  champion  in  1910,  won  the  singles 
honors  again  by  defeating  Joseph  J.  Armstrong,  also  of  St.  Paul,  in  four 
sets,  5/7,  6/0,  6/0,  6/1.  Adams  played  in  beautiful  form,  and  was  master 
of   the   situation   at   all    times. 

The  big  surprise  of  the  tournament  was  the  defeat  in  the  third  round 
of  J.  H.  Wheeler  of  St.  Paul,  the  president  of  the  association  and  well- 
known  veteran,  by  W.  U.  Knight  of  Minneapolis,  who  thus  loomed  up  as 
a  likely  dark  horse.  He  got  no  farther,  however,  meeting  Stellwagen  in 
the   next    round  and   getting  away   with   only    four   games. 

Adams  and   Armstrong  had   little  difficulty  in  annexing  the  doubles  title.

Jayne   and    Stellwagen    were   the    runners-up.   and   they   succeeded    in   giving 
the   winners  a   good   game  in    four   sets,   4/6,    10/8.    6/3,    6/4. 

The  women's  singles  were  won  by  Miss  Marguerite  Davis  of  St.  Paul, 
the  1910  champion.  Miss  Gwendolyn  Rees  of  St.  Paul,  the  holder  for 
191 1,  could  not  appear  to  defend  her  title.  Miss  Drake  of  St.  Paul,  the 
runner-up,  lost  to  Miss  Davis,  6/1,  6/3.  There  were  thirty  entrants  in 
this  event.     The   summaries:

Oklahoma  State  Championship 

John  T.  Bailey  regained  the  Oklahoma  title,  which  he  voluntarily  relin- 
quished in  191 1,  in  the  Oklahoma  State  championships,  held  August  6-10, 
at  the  McAlester  Country  Club,  McAlester.  The  tournament  proved  by 
far  the  most  successful  of  the  five  annual  championship  affairs  that  have 
been  held  in  the  State.  Six  States  besides  Oklahoma  were  represented — 
Kansas,  Wisconsin,  Missouri,  Arkansas,  Tennessee  and  Texas.  The  con- 
dition of  the  courts  was  severely  tried  by  three  days  of  heavy  rain,  but 
they   sustained  the   test    perfectly. 

John  T.  Bailey,  a  former  champion,  and  J.  D.  Adoue,  Jr.,  met  in  the 
final,  and  soon  it  was  seen  that  the  former  champion  was  not  going  to  give 
Adoue  a  chance  to  use  his  speed.  By  long  drives,  close  to  the  net,  he 
kept  the  Texan  on  the  defensive  throughout.  The  first  two  sets  went  to 
Bailey    at   6/2    each;    in    the    third    he    weakened    somewhat    under    Adoue's

final  assault,  but  even  then  held  on  to  the  set,  keeping  clean  his  slate  of 
no  lost  sets  in  a  state  championship  match,  and  won  8/6.  This  was 
Bailey's   fourth    Oklahoma    State   victory.      The    summaries:

The  fourteenth  annual  tournament  for  the,  championship  of  Oregon  was 
held  on  the  six  cement  courts  of  the  Multnomah  Amateur  Athletic  Club, 
Portland,  beginning  July  15.  The  Fiske  Challenge  Bowl,  offered  in  the 
men's  singles,  and  to  be  retained  permanently  only  after  three  wins,  has 
been  in  competition  since  1899,  yet  only  one  man,  W.»  A.  Goss  of  Port- 
land, has   as  yet   secured   two   legs   on   it.      In    1912   William   Johnston    won

his   first  leg  on   it,   last   year's   winner,   Charles   Foley   of  San   Francisco,  not 
being   present   to   defend   his   title. 

Johnston  and  Fottrell  had  no  real  competition  in  the  men's  doubles, 
meeting  Goss  and  Wickersham,  Portland's  veteran  team,  in  the  final  and

South  Dakota  State  Championship 

The  tennis  championship  of  South  Dakota  remained  in  the  possession  of 
Ray  Branson  of  Mitchell,  in  1912,  he  having  successfully  defended  his 
title  against  the  challenger,  John  Barton  of  Sioux  Falls,  July  24,  at  the 
latter  city.  This  was  Branson's  third  successive  win,  and  tlie  cup  becomes 
his  permanently.  ■  The  final  went  to  four  sets,  of  which  the  challenger 
took    the    first    at   8/6.      Both   played    a    heady    game    and    the    winner    had    to 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  117 

play  his  best  to  win,  6/8,  6/2,  6/2,  6/3.  Barton  had  his  revenge  in  the 
doubles,  where  he  in  turn  defended  his  title  successfully,  together  wit-h 
JFred  Phillips  of  Sioux  Falls,  against  Branson  and  Paul  Young  of  Ver- 
miiion,  they  winning  also  their  third  consecutive  victory  and  taking  per- 
manent possession  of  the  cups.  Branson  and  Young  gave  them  a  hard 
fight  in  the  final  and  led  at  one  time,  two  sets  to  one.  The  Sioux  Falls 
men  forged  ahead,  however,  and  won  the  match,  6/2,  2/6,   1/6,  6/4,  8/6. 

E.   J.   Anderson    of    Sioux    Falls   won   the  consolation   event   against   Mac- 
Knight,   also   of   Sioux   Falls,   3/6,   6/2,    6/1. 


Idaho  State  Championship 

J.  C.  Tyler  of  Spokane,  Wash.,  won  the  fourth  Idaho  State  champion- 
ship on  the  courts  of  the  Lewiston  Tennis  Club,  encountering  very  little 
difficulty  in  doing  so.  The  galleries  were  large  and  appreciative  and  they 
greatly  enjoyed  the   Washingtonian  in  action.     The   summaries:

Arkansas  State  Championship 

The  third  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Arkansas,  held  on 
the  courts  of  the  Little  Rock  Country  Club,  began  June  17,  with  twenty- 
six  entries  in  singles  and  eight  teams  in  doubles.  Unfortunately  weather 
conditions  were  a  severe  handicap.  Terrific  rains  practically  caused  two 
days'   delay. 

The  only  players  from  outside  the  State,  in  addition  to  Joseph  Cunning- 
ham, one  of  the  mainstays  of  the  game,  were:  J.  T.  Bailey  and  Dr.  Edgar 
Bailey  of  Albion,  Okla.  Dr.  Bailey  had  not  played  tournament  tennis  for 
years  and  he  competed  only  in  the  doubles.  Cunningham  reached  the  final 
in  singles,  where  he  lost  to  Bailey,  former  Oklahoma  champion,  6/2,  6/2, 
6/3.  In  the  challenge  round,  Ralph  Payne,  the  holder  of  the  title, 
defeated  Bailey,  6/4,  6/4,  12/10.  Payne  won  by  superior  court  work  and 
the   lack   of  condition   of   Bailey. 

In  the  doubles  Payne  and  Cunningham  were  too  strong  for  all  oppo- 
nents. In  the  semi-finals  the  Bailey  brothers  made  it  clear  that  they  knew 
the  doubles  game  and  showed  flashes  of  good  play,  but  they  were  neither 
steady  nor   consistent. 

In  the  finals  Campbell  and  Neimeyer  played  very  well  against  Payne  and 
Cunningham,  but  could  not  bunch  their  games  enough  to  win  a  set.  Cun- 
ningham was  distinctly  superior  to  Payne,  making  fewer  errors  and  a 
larger    percentage   of   kills.   The    summaries:

California  State   Championship 

William  Johnston,  California's  newest  wonderful  youngster,  won  the 
championship  of  the  State  in  the  annual  tournament,  which  was  held  at 
the  Claremont  Country  Club,  Oakland.  October  10-12.  He  defeated  Byron 
Batkin   in   the   tinal    round   in   straight   sets,    6/3,   6/4,  6/2. 

John  Strachan  and  Griffin,  playing  very  strong  doubles,  captured  that 
event  by  easily  defeating  Charles  Foley  and  Johnston  in  the  final  round 
at  6/0,  6/1,  6/2.  The  best  match  of  the  tournament  came  when  they 
defeated  C.  R.  Gardner  and  Elia  Fottrell  in  a  hot  three-set  tussle  in  an 
early  round.  Sumner  Hardy  and  Bates  gave  them  a  good  fight  for  two 
sets,  but  could  not  win   one. 

Maurice  E.  McLoughlin  made  his  first  appearance  in  an  open  event  since 
winning  the  national  titles,  playing  in  the  doubles  with  Wickham  Havens. 
They  eliminated  Sheldon  and  Murray,  the  Stanford  University  cracks,  but 
fell  before  Johnston  and  Foley  after  nearly  taking  the  second  set.  The 
champion  was  slack  and  short  of  practice,  the  event  being  little  else  than 
a   lark   for   him. 

Miss  Sarita  \'an  Fleet,  after  an  absence  of  six  or  eight  years,  returned 
in  time  to  enter  and  win  the  women's  singles,  as  well  as   the  handicap. 

In  the  final  of  the  singles  Johnston  showed  to  splendid  advantage,  bring- 
ing into  play  his  many  strokes  against  Batkin.  His  driving,  chopping  and 
volleying  were  very  accurate  and  speedy,  and  Batkin  was  never  dangerous. 
As  Long  was  in  Philadelphia,  the  challenge  round  went  by  default,  and 
Johnston   is   the   champion    for   a  year. 


Washington  State  Championship 

The  sensation  of  the  twenty-second  annual  tournament  of  the  State  of 
Washington,  held  by  the  Seattle  Tennis  Club,  beginning  August  12,  was 
the  defeat  of  M.  H.  Long  by  William  Johnston  in  the  final  round  of  the 
singles.  The  latter  had  come  through  to  the  final  round  by  defeating  Ward 
Dawson  in  straight  sets,  while  Long  had  dropped  the  second  set  to  Fottrell 
and  been  pushed  to  7/5  scores  in  the  other  two.  Still  no  one  expected 
anything  but  a  victory  for  the  former  Pacific  Coast  champion,  and  even 
after  Johnston  had  won  two  sets  the  gallery  watched  for  the  flashing  forth 
of  the  older  player.  But  Johnston  was  going  great  guns,  while  Long  could 
not  get  into  his  swing,  try  as  he  would.  The  result  was  that  Johnson  had 
the  advantage  to  the  end,  winning,   6/4,  6/4,  6/3.

Nebraska  State  Championship 

The  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  State  was  held  on  the 
courts  of  the  Norfolk  Tennis  Club,  beginning  July  15.  Players  came  from 
all  over  the  State,  and  the  local  racket  wielders  and  business  men  com- 
bined to  make  the  stay  of  the  visitors  a  pleasant  one.  Excellent  weather, 
three  fine  clay  courts,  and  a  large  and  representative  entry  list  made  the 
meeting  notable   and   successful. 

An  interesting  feature  of  the  tournament  was  the  doubles  victory  of 
"Con"  Young  of  Omaha,  who  was  one  of  the  winners  in  the  last  state 
tournament,  that  of  1895 — seventeen  years  ago.  Omaha  captured  both 
events,  for  Harry  Koch  of  that  city,  and  Young's  partner  in  the  doubles, 
stood  out  easily  as  the  best  of  the  singles  players.  He  lost  but  one  set 
in  the  event.     The  summaries:

SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNTS   ANNUAL.  123 

Iowa  State  Championship 

The  annual  open  tournament  for  the  championship  of  Iowa  was  held  on 
the  courts  of  the  Golf  and  Country  Club  at  L)es  Moines,  beginning 
August  12.  It  was  the  largest  and  best  tournament  ever  held  in  the  State. 
There  were  eighty-two  •Htries  in  the  singles  and  twenty-eight  teams  in  the 
doubles. 

The  new  champion,  Joe  J.  Armstrong  of  St.  Paul,  Minn.,  encountered 
much  more  opposition  on  his  road  to  victory  than  the  scores  would  indi- 
cate. Ex-champion  Fred  W.  Bradley,  who  is  playing  a  much  stronger  game 
than  for  the  past  two  years,  had  Armstrong  decidedly  groggy  in  the  fourth 
set,  and  only  by  the  most  determined  will  power  was  Armstrong  able  to 
stick  it  out  and  win  the  set.  In  the  challenge  round  with  Ray  L.  Granson 
the  first  two  sets  were  as  pretty  a  fight  as  one  would  care  to  see.  With 
the  sets  one  each  it  seemed  a  toss-up  as  to  who  w^as  the  best  man.  How- 
ever, the  day  was  very  hot,  and  lack  of  tournament  play  on  Branson's  part 
soon  began  to  tell,  and  he  was  not  able  to  put  up  much  opposition  in  the 
last  two  sets.     The  summaries: 

MEN'S  SINGLES. 
1      Semi-final  round — F.  W.  Bradley  d.  Joe  Adams,  6/3,  6/3,  6/1;  J.  J.  Arm-

Kansas  State  Championship 

The  annual  Kansas  open  state  championship  tournament  was  held,  as 
usual,  on  the  courts  of  the  Country  Club  at  Wichita  during  the  weeTc  of 
July  15.  An  entry  list  of  fifty  in  the  singles  and  twenty-one  teams  in  the 
doubles  assured  a  big  week.  The  singles  event  was  won  by  Jack  Cannon 
of  Kansas  City,  a  holder  of  many  titles,  from  Gordon  Parker  of  Wichita, 
the  match  going  in  straight  sets  to  the  Kansas  City  player.  Kansas  came 
to  the  front  in  the  doubles,  however,  A.  H.  Dickinson  and  R.  E.  Black, 
both  of  Wichita,  winning  over  Gordon  Parker  and  Donald  Cooper  of  the 
same  city,  the  match  going  to  the  full  five  sets  for  a  decision.  The

Massachusetts  State  Championship 

With  the  most  ideal  conditions  for  tournament  play  possible  the  Massa- 
chusetts singles  championships  were  decided  on  the  courts  of  the  Longwood 
Cricket  Club  of  Boston,  during  the  week  of  June  10.  The  courts  were  in 
fine  shape,  and  favored  by  good  weather  the  tourney  was  dispatched  with 
unusual  promptness.  The  entry  list  showed  a  slight  falling  off,  numbering 
sixty  as  against  seventy-one  for  the  191 1  event.  Great  regret  was 
expressed  at  the  absence  of  F.  J.  Sulloway,  the  challenger  of  the  year 
before,    who   has   moved   to   Concord,    N.   H. 

The  first  round  provided  few  close  matches,  most  of  the  favorites  win- 
ning easily.  The  only  close  contest  was  when  Harris  was  hard  pressed 
to    win    his   match   against   E.    V.   Page,   6/2,   4/6,    6/4. 

The  semi-finals  found  Dabney  pitted  against  Washburn  and  Bishop 
against  Cutting.  The  survivors,  Dabney  and  Bishop,  found  their  way 
into  the  final  in  two  bitterly  fought  matches,  full  of  brilliant  plays.  In 
his  match  against  Cutting,  Bishop  plucked  victory  out  of  the  jaws  of 
defeat — only  the  most  desperate  struggle  saving  him  from  going  under. 
Cutting  annexed  the  first  set  handily  at  6/4,  playing  the  much  improved 
tennis  which  characterized  his  game  during  the  whole  week.  Bishop  set- 
tled down  to  the  second  set,  and  by  driving  harder  and  with  sharper 
angles  ran  it  out  with  the  loss  only  of  two  games.  The  pace  had  been 
pretty  fast,  and  at  the  beginning  of  the  third  set,  both  men  seemed  willing 
to  stay  back  more,  and  settle  down  to  fight  it  out,  even  if  it  took  all 
summer.  Games  alternated,  but  Cutting  finally  forged  ahead,  and  on 
three  distinct  occasions  had  his  bulldog  opponent  within  one  point  of  the 
match.  Bishop,  however,  was  not  to  be  denied,  and  his  perseverance  was 
finally    rewarded    by    victory,    by    a    9/7    score. 

In  the  other  bracket  of  the  semi-finals,  Dabney  continued  the  clever 
tennis  which  he  showed  during  the  whole  week,  and  disposed  of  the  young 
Harvard  freshman  crack,  Washburn,  in  straight  but  hard  fought  sets, 
1 1/9   and    6/3. 


SPALDINGS    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  123 

Playing  a  brilliant  and  a  little  more  finished  game,  Dabney  defeated  his 
club-mate,  Bishop,  in  an  interesting  four-set  match,  the  score  being  7/5, 
4/6,   6/2,   6/3. 

Against  iNiles,  his  club  mate  and  old  doubles  partner,  Dabney  made  a 
good  showing  and  only  lost  after  a  four-set  match,  three  of  which  went 
to  deuce.  Niles  had  the  situation  pretty  well  in  hand,  but  was  at  all 
times  forced  to  do  his  best.  In  the  first  set,  by  well  placed  drives  and 
good  serving,  Niles  soon  had  a  lead  of  5  to  2.  Here  Dabney  took  one  of 
his  brilliant  streaks  and  won  four  straight  games,  lost  one  and  annexed 
the   next   two    for   the   set. 

Niles  started  out  the  second  set  at  top  speed  and  aided  by  many  errors 
on  the  part  of  his  opponent  ran  out  a  love  set  in  quick  fashion.  The 
next  two  sets  each  went  to  deuce,  with  Niles  having  a  little  the  better  of 
it  all  the  way.  Thus  for  the  third  times  Niles  won  the  Massachusetts  cham- 
pionship title  and  the  Challenge  Bowl  became  his  permanent  property.

126  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

chusetts    championship    doubles,    played    on    the    courts    of    the    Brae    Burn 
Country   Club,    Boston,    May    30   to   June    3. 

There  was  no  challenge  round  as  the  absence  of  Frank  J.  Sulloway,  who, 
paired  with  Deals  Wright,  won  the  event  in  191 1,  had  left  the  State, 
which  made  him  ineligible  to  compete.  The  tourney  was  further  weakened 
by  the  absence   of  many  of  the   State's  best  players. 

Most  of  the  contests  were  short,  the  Johnsons  being  carried  into  the 
fourth  round  by  two  defaults  and  a  straight  victory.  Rhoades  and  Bishop 
played  two  matches,  winning  both  easily,  but  lost  in  the  semi-tinal  round 
to  the  Johnsons. 

The  "hnal  contest  brought  together  J.  Wheelwright  and  E.  T.  Dana,  and 
although  it  required  four  sets  for  a  decision,  was  in  the  nature  of  an 
anti-climax.  It  was  close  at  times  as  all  four  men  exhibited  persistent 
work,  but  the  sharp  and  hard  smashes  of  the  Johnsons  finally  had  their 
reward.      The    summaries:

Chicago  Championship 


The  second  annual  tournament  for  the  lawn  tennis  championship  of 
Chicago  was  held  at  the  Kenwood  Country  Club,  July  13  to  20,  with  ninety- 
two  contestants  in  singles  and  thirty-six  teams  in  doubles.  The  feature 
of  the  tournament  was  the  playing  of  Miss  May  Sutton,  generally  con- 
sidered the  leading  woman  player  of  the  world.  In  the  men's  singles 
there  were  no  surprises,  Walter  T.  Hayes  winning  with  the  loss  of  only 
one   set,   although  he  was  given  a  good  fight  by  Burdick  in  the  semi-final. 

But  the  doubles  furnished  two  sensational  upsets.  The  first  came  in  the 
semi-final  round,  when  Squair  and  Green  of  the  University  of  Chicago 
defeated  Hayes  and  Forstall  in  straight  sets,  although  Hayes  and  Forstall 
had  been  generally  picked  as  nearly  sure  winners.  But  an  even  greater 
surprise  came  when  Burdick  and  John  T.  Bailey,  who  had  never  played  as 
a  team  before  the  tournament,  defeated  Squair  and  Green  in  a  long  and 
fiercely  contested  match  for  the  championship,  winning  the  last  set  at  6/0. 
This  match  went  to  five  sets,  with  Squair  and  Green  leading  until  the  latter 
part  of  the  fourth  set.  The  women's  singles  were  rather  one-sided  until 
the  final  match,  in  which  Miss  Carrie  Neely  played  a  splendid  game  and 
made  a  great  fight  against  May  Sutton,  forcing  the  first  set  to  deuce  and 
taking  four  games  in  the  third.  Miss  Sutton,  however,  was  playing  in 
excellent  form  and  held  the  match  safe  throughout.  Attracted  largely  by 
the  playing  of  Miss  Sutton,  of  Pasadena,  Cal.,  record-breaking  crowds 
witnessed  the    final   matches.      The    summary:

Western  Pennsylvania  Championship 

Usually  played  in  July,  the  twenty-fourth  Western  Pennsylvania  Cham- 
pionships were  delayed  until  August  31,  19 12,  to  make  room  for  the  Clay 
Courts  Championship  of  the  Pittsburgh  Athletic  Association,  with  the 
result  that  the  tournament  was  played  on  the  dampest  courts  possible  at 
the  Pittsburgh  (Pa.)  Golf  Club,  and  it  was  not  until  September  14  that 
the  challenge   round   was  reached.      This  brought  together   S.   Jarvis   Adan-s,

The  seventh  anpual  tournament  of  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  of 
Northwestern  Pennsylvania,  held  on  the  dirt  courts  of  the  Oil  City  Tennis 
Club,    during   the    week   of    August    12,    1912,    was   a   splendid   success. 

As  was  expected,  in  the  absence  of  last  year's  champion,  Wellington 
Weidler  of  Oil  City,  E.  E.  Lane  of  Lock  Haven  repeated  his  success  of 
1909  at  Franklin,  by  winning  the  singles  championship,  carrying  with  it 
two  cups — the  Association  Cup.  which  he  has  now  won  twice  and  retains, 
and  the  "Oil  City  Derrick"  Cup,  offered  for  permanent  possession  of  the 
winner. 

The  most  exciting  doubles  match  was  that  between  Lane  and  Armstrong 
of  Lock  Haven,  and  Thompson  and  Perry  of  Oil  City  in  the  third  round, 
which   the   former   pair   won.   6/3.    3/6,   6/4. 

The  Oil  City  Tennfs  Club  had  prepared  for  a  long  time  to  make  the 
tournament  a  success.     The  matches  were   scheduled,  and   were  played  with

the  regularity  of  clockwork.  The  Spalding  ball  was  the  official  ball  of  the 
tournament.  President  Yardley  of  Oil  City  states:  "The  Spalding  ball 
proved   very  satisfactory;   none   ripped;   there   were   no   complaints." 

The  officers  elected  for  the  ensuing  year  were:  President,  George  Yard- 
ley,  Oil  City;  vice-president,  M.  H.  Dewey,  Meadville;  secretary  and  treas-

Southern  Pennsylvania  Championship 

In  the  annual  Southern  Pennsylvania  championship  tournament,  played 
on  the  courts  of  the  Bedford  Springs  Tennis  Club,  August  17,  Percy  D. 
Siverd  carried  off  the  Bedford  Springs  Challenge  Cup  by  virtue  of  his 
third  victory,  when  he  won  the  singles  event.  The  conditions  for  the 
trophy  called  for  three  victories  before  the  cup  became  the  personal  prop- 
erty of  the  winner.  The  name  of  Siverd's  fellow  townsman,  H.  J.  Randall 
of  Pittsburgh,  is  twice  engraved  on  the  cup,  but  the  latter's  chance  to 
capture   it   vanished    with    Siverd's   victory. 

The  doubles  went  to  Siverd  and  T.  C.  Ward,  w-ho  defeated  Dr.  Stephens 
and   McEllroy   in    the   final   match.     The   vanquished    pair  lost   fifteen  games

Central  United  States  Championship 

The  fifth  annual  Central  Tennis  Championship  was  held  on  July  6  and 
entries  were  received  in  the  singles  and  twenty-four  teams  in  the  doubles. 
The  meeting  was  notable  for  the  scarcity  of  close  encounters,  there  being 
in  the  singles  but  three  matches  that  were  not  concluded  in  straight- sets, 
and  only  one  in  the  doubles.  C.  D.  Jones,  the  winner  of  the  singles,  was 
hard  pressed  in  but  one  match,  that  in  the  fourth  round  against  Ed. 
Serrano. 

Jones  and  Hoerr  waded  through  the  doubles  without  the  loss  of  a  set, 
defeating  Cannon  and  Hercules  in  the  final,  5/i,  6/4,  6/3.    The  summaries:

What  was  by  far  the  greatest  tournament  ever  held  in  Western  New 
York,  if  not  the  most  notable  of  the  clay  court  meetings  during  the  entire

ment of  the  Northwestern  Tennis  Association,  in  singles,  on  the  Burton

meet  L.  H.  Waidner  of  Chicago,  the  last  year's  winner,  in  the  usual  chal- 
lenge round,  Waidner  being  unable  to  defend  his  Northwestern  honors. 
J.  J.  Armstrong  and  J.  W.  Adams,  the  doubles  champions  of  last  year,  had

favored  with  weather  that  was  ideal  for  the  grass  covered  courts.  The 
tournament  was  started  on  July  15,  and  for  the  first  three  days,  went  along 
smoothly.  Then  came  the  sensation  of  the  week,  when  Stellwagen  met 
Armstrong  of  St.  Paul,  the  two-time  winner  and  holder  of  the  Minnesota.

4/6,  7/5,  6/4.  Then,  just  one  week  later,  Stellwagen  proved  that  he  had 
really  found  himself,  by  defeating  Ward  C.  Burton  in  the  final  and  cham- 
pionship round,  in  one  of  the  closest  matches  that  has  ever  been  contested

through  the  singles  by  steadiness  and  hard  hitting,  rather  than  by  bril- 
liance, and  her  showing  greatly  surprised  the  experts.  Mrs.  C.  N.  Beard, 
the  1912  victor  in  the  New  Jersey  State  Championship,  in  her  half  of  the 
draw,  created  a  sensation  by  defeating  Miss  Marie  Wagner,  present  holder 
of  the  indoor  title.  The  doubles  went  to  Mrs.  Beard  and  Miss  Steever, 
who  combined  excellent  team  play  with  brilliancy  at  the  net  and  steadiness 
from    the    back    of    the    court.      The    summaries:

Central  Iowa  Tennis  Association  Tournament 

The  seventh  annual  tournament  of  the  Central  Iowa  Tennis  Association 
•was  held  on  its  home  courts,  Toledo,  Iowa,  July  8-13,  1912,  and  was  a 
success  from  start  to  finish.  There  was  but  one  default  in  the  whole  meet, 
one  player  being  unable  to  report.  The  quality  of  play  has  never  been 
excelled  in  Iowa,  and  the  large  gallery  showed  its  appreciation  by  its 
close   attendance    throughout   the    entire   tournament. 

The  decision  of  the  board  to  continue  this  as  an  open  tournament  has 
pleased  its  friends  from  many  States,  and  quite  a  number  of  players  have 
planned  to  take  advantage  of  the  splendid  practice  afforded  by  this  meet, 
which  comes  comparatively  early  in  the  season,  the  1913  dates  being  July 
7-12.      The    summary   of  the    1912    tournament   follows:

Long  Island  Championship 

Vigorously  contested  matches  marked  the  competition  of  the  sixth  annual 
Long  Island  championships,  held  at  the  Kings  County  Tennis  Club,  Brook- 
lyn, June  24.  The  winner  of  the  singles  was  S.  Howard  \'oshell  of 
Brooklyn. 

The  deferred  (Challenge  round  was  played  on  July  29,  in  which  G.  F.  . 
Touchard,  the  standing-out  title  holder,  secured  his  second  leg  on  the 
Eagle  Cup,  by  his  victory  over  the  tournament  winner,  S.  H.  Voshell,  in 
a  five-set  match.  The  match  was  held  over  in  consequence  of  Touchard's 
absence  from  the  city  in  June.  Touchard  played  rather  listlessly  most  of 
the  time,  and  as  Voshell  was  in  earest  all  the  time  it  is  not  surprising  that 
the  New  Yorker  had  many  close  calls.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  he  was  nine 
times  within  the  loss  of  the  match.  In  the  fourth  set  Voshell,  who  was 
leading  2  sets  to  i,  got  to  5/3  and  40  love  on  Touchard's  service;  the 
latter  brought  it  to  deuce,  and  then  the  game  see-sawed,  each  man  having 
advantage    a    number    of    times.      Touchard    finally    won   the    game    and    fol-

lowed  it  up  with  the  win  of  the  set.  Voshell  led  at  4/2  in  the  fifth  set, 
but  Touchard  came  stronger  and  won  out  at  8/6. 

Fifty-nine  games  were  required  before  the  final  struggle  terminated  in 
favor  of  Voshell.  <A.  H.  Man,  his  opponent,  played  so  well  at  times  that 
its  was  thought  that  he  would  win,  as  Voshell  showed  a  disposition  to  do 
streaky  work,  but  he  came  to  the  fore  by  winning  the  first  two  sets  and 
the  fifth.

West  Side  Tennis  Club  Tournament 

The  annual  tournament  for  the  championship  of  the  West  Side  Tennis 
Club  of  New  York  City  in  men's  singles  and  doubles  was  held  on  the 
club's  clay  courts  238th  Street  and  Broadway,  beginning  May  18.  Owing 
to  the  early  date  for  the  events  and  the  fact  that  the  men  were  not  fully 
keyed  up  to  their  strokes,  surprises  were  sprung  in  both  events.  The  first 
came  in  the  singles  when  G.  F.  Touchard  was  defeated  by  G.  C.  Shafer. 
The  final  round  brought  together  W.  B.  Cragin,  Jr.,  and  R.  D.  Little,  the 
latter   winning. 

In  the  doubles,  H.  H.  Hackett  and  L.  E.  Mahan  won  the  title  from

Columbia  Country  Club  Tournament 

The  Colurnbia  Country  Club,  Chevy  Chase,  on  the  outskirts  of  Wash- 
ington, D.  C.  accomplished  wonders  in  its  tennis  department  during  the 
season  of  1912 — its  first  tennis  year.  Twelve  of  the  finest  clay  courts  of 
the  South  were  completed  and  worked  into  fast  playing  condition.  Twenty 
feet  of  turf  lies  between  neighboring  courts,  affording  ample  room  for 
spectators   and   making  the   layout   most   pleasing  to   the   eye. 

Two  of  the  largest  tournaments  ever  run  off  in  the  vicinity  of  Wash- 
ington were  successfully  conducted.  The  Spring  tournament  was  a  closed 
affair  and  the  first  club  championship  was  won  by  Norris  McLean,  who 
defeated  E.  O.  Leech  in  a  five-set  match  in  the  finals.  The  doubles  was 
won  by  C.  B.  Doyle  and  George  Mills.  The  Fall  tournament  was  an  open 
invitation  event,  H.  E.  Doyle  (Columbia)  coming  out  on  top  in  the  singles 
and  Lee  McClung  (Chevy  Chase)  being  the  runner-up.  E.  O.  Leech 
(Columbia)  captured  the  consolation  singles.  H.  E.  Doyle  and  E.  C. 
Graves  (Columbia)  won  the  doubles,  defeating  Lee  McClung  and  Spencer 
Gordon    (Chevy   Chase)    in  the   final    round. 

The     Columbia    tennis    team     won    the    championship    of    the     section    by 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAL.  163 

defeating  the  Chevy  Chase  team,  six  points  to  three,  the  latter  in  turn 
decisively   defeating  the  Bachelors   team. 

Columbia  is  fortunate  to  number  among  its  members  many  of  the  best 
players  of  the  locality — C.  B.  Doyle,  John  C.  Davidson,  H.  E.  Doyle, 
Norris  McLean,  E.  O.  Leech,  John  Britton,  Arthur  Slater  and  H.  C. 
Sheridan  being  a   few  of  the   stars. 

The  tennis  committee  is  as  follows:  A.  Y.  Leech,  Jr.,  chairman;  W.  H. 
Ronsaville.  George  Mills,  H.  T.  Shannon,  and  E.  W.  Deakin,  all  of  whom 
are  enthusiastic  workers,  contributing  much  to  the  remarkable  success  of 
the  tennis  department  of  the  club. 

Philadelphia  Outdoor  Night  Tournament 

What  was  termed  the  first  successful  outdoor  night  tennis  tournament 
of  the  East,  and  which  proved  entirely  successful  from  all  standpoints,  was 
held  at  the  Belfield  Country  Club,  Philadelphia,  on  October  24.  It  was  a 
doubles  competition  of  invitation  nature,  with  sixteen  pairs  making  up  the 
field.  The  winners  were  T.  H.  Martin  and  P.  S.  Osborne,  who  triumphed 
over  E.  D.  Moore  and  T.  W.  Smith  in  the  final  round,  after  a  four-set 
match. 

The  lighting  system  of  the  courts  was  found  by  the  players  to  be  almost 
equal  to  that  of  sunlight,  permitting  the  fastest  kind  of  play.  The  light 
was  evenly  distributed,  so  that  there  were  no  shadows,  and  strokes  could 
be  made  with  as  much  freedom  as  by  sunlight.  The  tournament  was 
started  early  in  August,  the  club  establishing  one  night  a  week,  Thursday, 
as   tennis  night.      The   summaries:

JACK  CANNON.  hEATH  MOORE. 

Missouri  Valley  Doubles  Champions.  1912 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  167 


Missouri  Valley  Championships 

For  the  eleventh  time  the  Missouri  Valley  tennis  championships  were 
held  at  Kansas  City,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club, 
the  week  of  August  12.  Jack  Cannon  of  Kansas  City,  a  winner  of  many 
western  titles,  captured  the  singles  championship,  while  paired  with  Heath 
Moore,  another  Kansas  City  Athletic  Club  player,  likewise  annexed  the 
doubles  title. 

The  final  in  the  singles  between  Jones  and  Cannon  was  disappointing. 
Cannon  had  everything,  while  Jones  showed  the  effects  of  his  hard  week's 
play.  In  fact,  he  was  never  at  any  time  in  the  running,  nor  did  he  put 
up  the  game  he  is  capable  of.  Cannon  plays  all  of  his  strokes  strictly 
according  to  form  and  has  not  played  better  tennis  this  year  than  he  did 
according  to  form  and  had  not  played  better  tennis  last  year  than  he  did 
in  this  match.  His  drives  down  the  sides  had  unusual  speed,  his  over- 
head smashing  was  terrific,  and,  when  forced  occasionally  to  lob,  they 
were  timed   and   executed   to   a   nicety. 

The  finals  in  the  doubles  brought  together  Cannon  and  Moore  against 
Jones  and  Bailey.  The  day  was  a  scorcher,  but  a  gallery  of  five  or  six 
hundred  turned  out  for  the  match.  Jones  and  Bailey  took  the  opener  at 
6/4,  by  steady  and  accurate  play  at  the  net.  The  second  set  was  a  "see- 
saw" affair  to  4-all,  when  Cannon  and  Moore  put  on  just  the  necessary 
steam  to  pull  it  out  at  the  same  score.  Cannon  and  Moore  were  now 
playing  the  better  tennis  and  in  the  third  set  Moore's  work,  especially  on 
his  serve  and  cross  court  drives,  w^as  of  the  highest  order.  This  set  also 
was  hard  fought,  but  Cannon  and  Moore  finished  in  front  by  the  same 
score  as  the  two  preceding  sets.  The  fourth  and  deciding  set  found  Jones 
badly  tired  and  Bailey  but  little  better.  Moore  also  showed  the  effects  of 
the  hard  play,  but  Cannon,  who  is  tireless,  came  to  the  front  with  a  fresh 
burst  of  speed  and  the  outcome  was  never  in  doubt.  Cannon  bore  the 
brunt  of  the  play,  killing  from  all  parts  of  the  court  and  driving  viciously. 
The  set  was  captured  at  6/1.     The  summary  follows:

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS  .ANNUAL.  171 


Lawn  Tennis  in  St.  Louis 

By  Robert  Ross, 
Secretary  St.   Louis  Amateur  Athletic  Association, 

The  St.  Louis  Amateur  Athletic  Association,  popularly  known  as  the 
"Triple  A,"  is  the  only  organization  that  devotes  its  energy  and  money  in 
developing  the  game  of  tennis  in  the  city,  as  well  as  keeping  up  a  fine 
nine-hole  golf  course,  a  hand  ball  court,  outdoors,  and  a  base  ball  team. 
The  association  has  sixteen  courts,  which  are  said  by  visitors  who  attend 
the  central  championships  to  be  the  finest  in  the  country.  There  is  also  a 
very  good  grass  court  and  a  cement  court,  the  latter  being  used  in  wet 
weather  when  the  clay  courts  are  out  of  commission — and  the  annual  dues 
are  only  $io  a  year.  The  association  has  a  pretty  club  house,  with  six 
hundred  lockers,   and  shower  baths. 

The  association  championship  of  19 12  was  the  first  'tournament  on  the 
calendar,  and  the  honors  went  to  the  younger  players,  the  "vets"  having 
been  eliminated  in  the  second  round.  H.  P.  Gautier  defeated  Joseph 
Hercules  in  the  finals  for  the  association  trophy  in  singles,  6/4,  7/5,  6/3< 
In  the  doubles  championship  Jones  and  Hoerr,  the  association's  crack 
players,  defeated    Ed   Serrano  and   Grover  C.    Holthaus,  2/6,  6/4.   6/4,   6/3. 

In  July  the  Central  tennis  championship  was  held  under  this  associa- 
tion's auspices  and  proved  a  big  success,  the  entry  list  being  much  larger 
and  the  playing  more  classy.  Jack  Cannon  of  Kansas  City,  who  won  the 
title  last  year,  again  competed,  and  as  the  tournament  progressed  the 
"fans,"  who  averaged  daily  about  500  persons,  took  a  special  interest  in 
Cannon's  playing.  In  the  semi-finals,  when  he  met  Roland  Hoerr,  the 
player  whom  he  defeated  for  the  big  cup  the  previous  year,  brought  out 
one  of  the  largest  crowds  that  ever  attended  a  tennis  match  in  this  city. 
Hoerr  won,  6/2,  6/0,  2/6,  6/1,  and  earned  the  right  to  meet  Drum- 
mond  Jones,   who  had   worked    his   way   to   the   finals. 

In  the  final  round  Jones  defeated  Hoerr,  6/3.  6/1,  8/6,  and  by  doing  so 
took  the  big  solid  silver  trophy  out  of  competition,  having  won  it  three 
times. 

In  the  doubles,  Jones  and   Hoerr  and   Cannon  and   Hercules,    after   some 
hard    matches,    won    their    waj"-   to    the    finals.      Jones   and   Hoerr    won,    6/1,  f 
6/4,  6/3.  ' 

Francis  Sullivan,  one  of  the  younger  players,  won  the  consolation  sin- 
gles, and  Clarence   King  and   A.   Wear   won   the   doubles   consolation. 

In  the  City  championship  another  big  entry  list  was  received.  Jones 
and  Hoerr  again  won  their  way  to  the  final  and  were  met  by  Guy  Oliver 
and  A.  Wear.  The  final  of  this  match  was  one  of  the  hardest  tennis  con- 
tests erer  seen  on  the  courts  here  in  many  years,  nearly  every  game  going 
to  deuce.     Jones  and  Hoerr  finally  won,  9/7,   7/5,  8/6. 

In  the  singles,  Drummond  Jones  again  demonstrated  that  he  was  the 
best  player  in  the  city  by  defeating  Clarence  Gamble  in  the  final  round  of 
the  singles,  6/3,  4/6,  6/3,  6/2.  Jories  took  the  Bonner  Miller  Cup  out  of 
competition   in    this  tournament,   having   won   it   three   times. 

Harold  R.  Small  is  the  president  of  this  popular  association,  and  is  an 
enthusiastic  tennis  player.  Robert  M.  Willson,  a  prominent  young  attorney, 
is  the  tennis  chairman.  He  has  done  much  to  make  the  game  of  tennis 
as  popular  as  it  is  in  St.  Louis.  Louis  Templeman  is  one  of  the  young 
players  of  whom  much  is  expected,  in  the  next  year  or  so,  in  St.  Louis 
tennis  circles. 


172  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

Tennis  in  Milwaukee 

By   Rockwell   Hinkley. 

Alexander  Squair  of  the  University  of  Chicago  won  the  Wisconsin  State 
tennis  championship  for  a  second  consecutive  time,  when  he  defeated 
Albert  Green,  also  of  Chicago,  in  the  challenge  round  on  the  courts  of  the 
Milwaukee     Town     Club. 

Green,  who  played  remarkably  well  through  the  tournament  proper, 
extended  the  young  champion  to  the  limit,  and  only  by  dint  of  a  supreme 
final  effort  did  Squair  return  himself  a  winner.  The  fifth  and  final  set, 
which  was  a  deuce  affair,  was  several  times  within  Green's  grasp,  but 
by  cool   and   heady   playing  Squair   retained   his  title. 

Reginald  Hamilton  and  John  Johnston  of  the  Milwaukee  Town  Club 
won  the  doubles  titles  by  default  in  the  challenge  round  from  Forstall 
and  Larned  of  Chicago,  after  defeating  Squair  and  Stewart  of  Chicago  in 
the  finals  of  the  elimination  event.  This  is  the  first  time  for  several  years 
that  a  State  title  has  been  won  by  a  Milwaukee  team  and  Messrs.  Hamilton 
and  Johnston  deserve  great  commendation  for  bringing  the  title  back  to 
Wisconsiri. 

'1  he  tournament  revealed  several  budding  young  stars  who  are  bound  to 
be  heard  from  in  the  future.  Alfred  Weller,  a  fourteen-year-old  lad,  gave 
Green  a  hard  run  in  the  elimination  event,  and  forced  the  Chicago  star  to 
play  a  fast  game  in  order  to  win.  His  stroke  shows  great  promise,  and 
under  the  tutelage  of  the  famous  R.  N.  Williams  he  is  certain  to  advance 
rapidly.  "Jerry"  Weber  and  young  Lindauer,  Chicago  High  School  stars, 
worked  their  way  well  through  the  tourney,  and  showed  unmistakable  signs 
of  future  championship  form.  "Ned"  Allis,  the  Wisconsin  Golf  champion, 
showed  his  versatility  by  advancing  to  the  semi-final  round  in  the  singles, 
where   he   was   defeated   by   Johnston. 

By  defeating  the  Aztec  Club  of  Chicago  in  an  inter-club  event,  the 
Milwaukee  Town  Club  players  won  the  club  championship  of  the  Middle 
West  and  incidentally  dethroned  the  famous  Chicago  organization  for  the 
first  time  in  many  years.  The  members  of  the  championship  team  were: 
R.  N.  Hamilton,  John  Johnston,  Glenway  Maxon,  George  Gibbs,  Alfred 
Weller  and  Lester  Mayhew.  The  above  match  was  arranged  incident  to 
the  winning  of  the  Illinois  and  Wisconsin  titles  by  the  respective  clubs. 
The  Town  Club  team  cleaned  up  everything  around  Milwaukee,  and  was 
returned   victorious   in    a   long    schedule    of   inter-club   events. 

Glenway  Maxon  and  Rockwell  Hinkley  were  members  of  the  University 
of  Wisconsin  team,  the  latter  captaining  the  squad  to  a  successful  season. 
Many  all-star  teams  were  picked  by  critics  and  local  scribes  at  the  end 
of   the    season,    the    composite    selection    of    which    were   about   as    follows: 

Singles — i,  Hamilton;  2,  Johnston;  3,  Mayhew;  4,  Maxon;  5,  Weller; 
6.   Allis:    7,   Hinkley;    8,   Gibbs;   9,   Benson;    10,    Lipman. 

Doubles — I,  Hamilton  and  Johnston;  2,  Hinkley  and  Maxon;  3,  Weller 
and   Gibbs;   4,   Lipman   and   Reed;    5,   Benson   and   Seefeld. 

Miss  Katherine  Waldo  of  Chicago  won  the  Women's  State  event  when 
she  defeated  Miss  Alice  Hibbard  of  Milwaukee  in  a  closely  contested  match 
in  the  final  round.  This  tourney  was  a  success  from  every  point  of  view, 
and  is  now  an   established  institution  in  Wisconsin. 

Milwaukee  bids  fair  to  become  an  important  mecca  of  tennis  stars, 
and  rumor  is  already  afloat  that  R.  N.  Williams  and  Maurice  McLoughlin' 
will  be  seen  in  the  191 3  State  meet.  Tennis  has  come  to  stay  in  this 
municipality  that  is  now  crawling  over  the  400,000  mark  in  population, 
and    we    all    look    forward    to    a    banner    year    this    coming    summer.

Westchester  Doubles.— Although  there  was  some  well  contested  matches,  the 
majority  of  the  games  in  the  annual  invitation  round-robin  doubles  of  the

brought  out  five  teams,  were  decided  on  the  club's  courts  near  Westchester 
Village,  N.  Y..  July  22-27.  The  competition  consisted  of  three  games  for

a  single  defeat,  not  being  required  to  play  their  game  with  Ilackett  and 
Mahan  after  each  of  the  other  teams  had  all  lost  a  brace  of  games.  The 
match  with  Hackett  and  Mahan,  which  would  have  been  an  exhibition  game, 
was  called  off  at  the  request  of  the  latter,  who  were  anxious  to  get  away.

Old  Bominion  Tournament. — With  eighty  entrants  in  the  various  events  and 
a  minimum  of  defaults  the  eighth  annual'  Old  Dominion  tennis  tournament  for 
the  Hermitage  Challenge  Cup  was  held  on  the  courts  of  the  Virginia  Country 
Club  during  the  week  of  June  10.  Of  the  players,  who  took  part  in  the  com- 
petition, twenty-five  were  from  various  points  between  New  York  and  Atlanta. 
The  men's  singles  brought  out  fifty-three  players.  In  the  preliminary  round, 
while  a  number  of  matches  went  into  three  sets,  the  hardest  fought  match 
was  between  J.  E.  Tyler,  Jr..  of  Richmond  and  John  K.  Graves  of  Wash- 
ington, which  was  won  by  the  former,  11/9.  4/6.  6/4.  In  the  semi-final  round 
Thornton  disposed  of  Tyler,  6/3,  6/3,  while  James  had  no  trouble  in  winning 
from  W.  Nelson  Page  of  Winchester,  Va.,  6/3.  6/2.  This  brought  out  Thorn- 
ton and  James  in  the  final,  which  was  played  on  June  17.  While  the 
majority  of  the  players  and  soectators  had  looked  forward  to  James  winning 
over  Thornton,  the  latter  sprung  a  surprise  by  the  rather  easy  fashion  in 
which  he  disposed  of  the  favorite,  6/2.  6/2.  8/6.  In  the  absence  of  T.  R. 
Pell,  holder  of  the  Hermitage  Cup  in  men's  singles,  the  trophy  passed  to 
Thornton  by  default.  In  women's  singles  Mrs.  J.  S.  Taylor,  formerly  Miss 
Hildegarde  Turle  of  Norfolk,  who  had  once  before  won  the  Hermitage  Chal-

day afternoon,  Mrs.  Taylor  disposing  of  Mrs.  Hardy  in  a  beautiful  matclx, 
6  4,  6/2.  Owing  to  the  absence  of  Mrs.  Willard  E.  Sullivan  there  was  n» 
challenge  round,  the  cup  going  to  Mrs.  Taylor  by  default.  In  the  final  round 
of  the  men's  doubles,  between  Evans  and  Shaner,  and  Buford  and  Dunn,

High  School  carried  off  the  honors  for  the  championship  of  New  York  Citj, 
in  the  lawn  tennis  tournament  held  by  the  Public  Schools  Athletic  League, 
beginning  April  27.  Thirteen  schools  Avere  entered,  including  six  from  th« 
Manhattan-Bronx-Richmond  division  and  seven  from  the  Brooklyn-Queens 
division.  Morris  High  did  not  meet  with  a  defeat.  Its  victories  were:  Town- 
send  Harris,  3—2;  Curtis,  4—1;  DeWitt  Clinton,  4—1;  Commerce,  4—1:  Stuy- 
vesant,  5 — 0,  and  the  championship  final  with  Manual  Training,  June  15,  4 — 1.

Harvard  University  Championship.— Watlson  M.  Washburn.  1915,  won  the 
Harvard  University  championship  for  1912.  He  was  not  hard  pressed  at  any 
time  during  the  competition.  The  entry  list,  although  large,  lacked  the  names 
of  E.  H.  Whitney,  '14,  and  R.  N.  Williams,  Jr..  '16,  both  of  whom  would 
have  been  contenders  for  the  title.  Williams  entered,  but  defaulted  in  the 
first  round.  The  final  between  Armstrong  and  Washburn  was  less  close  tham 
expected,  and  the  quality  of  tennis  was  disappointing.  Both  men  were  erratic 
and  lacking  in  aggressiveness.  Washburn,  however,  held  the  upper  hand 
throughout,  showed  greater  confidence,  find  a  better  control  in  the  critical 
places.  With  his  long,  well-directed  drives  he  kept  his  opponent  on  the  run 
continually,  and  made  him  do  the  work.  Washburn's  coolness  did  not  improve 
Armstrong's  game;  after  the  first  part  of  the  first  set,  when  the  play  was 
even,  Washburn  went  to  the  fore  and  was  never  passed.  The  sets  were  6/4, 
6/3,    6/2. 

Nassau  Country  Club  Invitation  Tournament.— The  annual  invitation  tourna- 
ment of  the  Nassau  Country  Club  was  held  on  the  club's  courts,  at  Glen 
Cove,  L.  I.,  September  13,  14  and  15.  A  singles  event  was  added  to  the  dou- 
bles contest  previously  inaugurated.  The  latter  attracted  eight  pairs,  and 
there  were  sixteen  entries  in  the  singles.  G.  F.  Touchard  showed  a  return  to 
form,  winning  the  singles  event  from  R.  D.  Little,  which  was  not  played 
until  September  28,  and  partnered  with  R.  D.  Little,  the  pair  captured  the 
doubles.  Both  the  finals  were  closely  contested,  each  requiring  five  sets  for 
a  decision.  The  doubles  partners  faced  each  other  in  the  final  round  of  ftbs 
singles  and  Touchard  made  one  of  his  remarkable  recoveries,  losing  tlie  first 
Ivso  sets  and  winning  the  third  and  fifth  at  love,  and  allowing  Little  but 
eleven  points  in  the  former  set.  In  the  doubles  final  the  former  champions 
had  their  work  cut  out  in  order  to  win  from  Karl  H.  Behr  and  Fred  C. 
Inman. 

Seabright  Lawn  Tetinis  and  Country  Club  Tournament.— Bernon  S.  Prentice 
again  won  both  the  singles  and  doubles  championship  of  the  Seabright  (N.  J.)

ginia State  champion  of  1911.  won  the  singles  event  in  fine  style  in  the 
annual  tournament  of  the  Western  Michigan  Tennis  Association,  held  on  the 
courts  of  the  Grand  Rapids  Boat  and  Canoe  Club.  Grand  Rapids,  during  the 
week  of  August  5.  Later,  paired  with  Sidney  E.  Sweet,  he  accounted  for 
the  doubles  event.  Neither  Bundy  nor  Walter  C.  Lee  experienced  much 
opposition  on  the  road  to  the  final  of  the  singles,  each  player  disposing  of 
four   mcE   without   allowing   a    set   to    go    to   deuce.     The   meeting   of    the    two

finalists,  however,  was  productive  of  deuce  sets,  which  had  been  lacking 
hitherto,  for  all  four  sets  were  carried  to  extra  innings.  The  most  interest- 
ing match  in  the  doubles  came  in  the  semifinal  round,  in  which  Nathan  Bundy 
and  S.  E.  Sweet  defeated  Harvey  Bundy  and  Lee.  S' -eet  contributed  steadi- 
ness, Bundy  a  steady  and  speedy  forehand  drive,  which  proved  to'o  strong  a 
combination  for  their  oppoftt^flts  to  overcome. 

University  of  Colorado.— The  interest  In  tennis  at  the  University  of  Colorado 
has  developed  remarkably  in  the  Jast  two  or  three  years.  With  the  addition 
of  four  new  courts,  donated  by  the  regents,  the  students  have  seven  courts 
at  their  disposal.  Two  tournaments  are  held  yearly,  one  in  the  fall  and 
one  in  the  spring;  the  latter  to  pick  a  team  for  the  intercollegiate.  In  the 
fall  tournament,  held  in  October,  1912,  there  were  sixteen  entries  in  singles 
and  seven  teams  in  doubles.  The  semi-finals  in  all  cases  were  closely  con- 
tested, each  match  going  the  flve-set  limit.  Axelrood  won  the  singles  by 
defeating    Griffin   three   straight   sets   in   the   final   round,    6/2,    9/7,    6/3,    and

Karr,  with  McLean  as  runner-up,  the  scores  being-  6/4,  6/4,  6/4.  The  men's 
doubles  event  was  won  by  Meade  and  McLean.  This  was  the  first  annual

Meadville  (Pa.)  Lawn  Tennis  Club.— The  Meadville  Lawn  Tennis  Club  was 
organized  June  14.  1912,  with  forty-one  members,  which  has  since  been 
increased  to  sixty-two.  Courts  were  rented  in  various  parts  of  the  town 
during  the  season,  and  then  In  September  plans  were  started  for  1913.  Sub- 
scriptions were  raised  to  an  amount  that  would  enable  the  club  to  lay  out 
four  larger  courts  in  a  playing  space  of  175  feet  by  140  feet,  on  a  lot  in  the 
heart  of  the  residential  section  of  the  town.  These  courts  will  be  built  at 
once,  and  tennis  will  be  given  a  boom  such  as  it  never  had  in  its  history 
here  in  Meadville.  The  club  in  1912  entered  a  team  of  six  men — Carl  Deutsch, 
Douglas  Dunbar.  Fred  Trace,  Leon  Doubet,  M.  H.  Dewey,  and  A.  J.  Dewey — 
in  the  tournament  with  the  Lawn  Tennis  Association  of  northwestern  Penn- 
sylvania, which  M'as  held  In  Oil  City  in  August.  The  team  was  early  elim- 
inated as  the  tennis  was  not  good  enough  for  the  company  in  which  the 
men  were  playing.  One  inter-city  match  was  played  with  Oil  City  on  the 
grounds  of  the  Country  Club  at  Meadville  and  the  local  men  won  four  of 
the  six  matches.  The  fall  tournament  was  completed  late  in  September  and 
was  won  by  M.  H.  Dewey,  with  W.  D.  Lewis  as  runner-up.  The  officers  of 
the  club  are:  A.  J.  Dewey,  president;  R.  E.  B.  Hall,  secretary  and  treas- 
urer; Prof.  Edwin  Lee,  chairman  of  executive  committee.  M.  H.  Dewey  Is 
vice-president  of    the    Northwestern    Pennsylvania    Lawn  Tennis   Association. 

Philadelphia  District  Titles.— Out  of  an  entry  list  of  fifty-seven  players 
in  the  singles.  Rowland  Evans,  Jr.,  a  comparative  youth  in  the  game, 
triumphed  for  the  honors  at  the  annual  championship  of  Philadelphia  and 
district,  held  on  the  grass  courts  of  the  Germantown  Cricket  Club  at  Man- 
heim.  beginning  September  7.  Evans  performed  creditably  at  Newport, 
getting  to  the  third  round,  where  he  fell  before  Nat  Niles.  It  was  expected 
that  both  R.  N.  Williams,  Jr.,  and  W.  F.  Johnson  would  play  for  the 
championship  of  their  native  city,  but  the  former  wired  from  Buffalo  that 
be  would  be  unable  to  compete,  and  Johnson  was  scratched  at  the  last 
minute.  It  was  a  unique  sight  for  the  Philadelphia  tennis  followers  who 
galleried  for  the  final  rounds  to  see  two  men — EVans  and  Rodgers — playing 
for  the  championship,  neither  of  whom  had  ever  previously  approached  as 
close  as  the  seml-fina]  round  in  this  event.  Rodgers  was  the  favorite  on 
account  of  his  greater  experience  and  for  the  reason  that  he  had  disposed 
of  the  hardest  men  in  the  tournament.  After  dropping  the  first  set.  Evans 
changed  his  tactics.  He  decided  to  play  Rodgers  at  his  own  game,  depend- 
ing upon  his  speed  and  hard  hitting  to  give  him  an  advantage.  This  set 
dragged  terribly,  and  the  balls  passed  monotonously  back  and  forth  over  the 
ret  countless  times.  It  was  Evans'  '  speed  which  finally  triumphed  over 
Rodgers'  steadiness,  and  the  set  went  to  the  Yale  man  at  6/3.  The  third 
set  was  a  marathon.  Evans,  by  working  to  the  ne't  and  smashing  hard  for 
the  short  side  lines,  finally  captured  it  at  10/8.  Rodgers  made  little  resist- 
ance in  the  final  set,  which  Evans  won  at  6/1,  and  Philadelphia  had  a  new 
champion.  Thirty-two  pairs  entered  for  the  doubles,  and  Tilden  and  Thayer, 
and  Carpenter  and  Dewhurst,  both  former  title-holders,  were  in  the  list. 
This  was  an  event  of  surprises.  Tilden  and  Thayer  winning  after  four  sets.

Tennis  in  New  Orleans,  La.— R.  C.  Acomb,  president  of  the  Alpha  Omega 
Club,  has  this  to  say  about  the  game  in  New  Orleans:  "Three  years  ago  the 
city  parks  of  New  Orleans  contained  but  three  tennis  courts.  At  present 
there  are  fourteen  courts  in  Audubon  Park  and  a  few  in  the  City  Park. 
There  is  no  reason  why  tennis  should  not  be  encouraged  by  the  sport  lovers 
of  the  South's  great  city.  The  parks  can  easily  accommodate  five  times  the 
number  of  tennis  courts  than  are  at  present  laid  out.     Tennis  has  taken  great

strides  Jn  the  far  South  in  the  last  few  years,  and  as  it  is  a  game- 
peculiarly  adaptable  to  the  Southern  climate,  and  as  it  appeals  particularly 
to  the  fair  sex,  it  should  be  encouraged  to  the  fullest  extent.  Tenuis  is  a 
scientific,  yet  not  too  strenuous  game,  and  on  this  account  should  appeal  to 
both  young  and  old.  of  both  se-xes,  as  a  means  of  recreation.  May  it» 
popularity  never  decrease  in  the  Southland.  Many  persons  in  comfortable 
circumstances,  have,  of  course,  the  means  of  laying  out  and  maintaining  a 
tennis  court  on  their  own  lawns,  but  the  average  person,  with  a  predilection 
toward  tennis,  must  depend  upon  the  city  parks  for  a  court,  said  court  of 
course  to  be  kept  in  conrlition  by  the  members  of  the  tennis  clubs  using  the 
court.  It  is,  therefore,  evident  that  as  tennis  is  on  the  boom  in  our  city, 
and  is  being  taken  up  by  all  classes  of  society,  the  park  commissioners  of 
New  Orleans  should  procure  additional  ground  for  the  laying  out  of  tenuis, 
courts."

women  was  played  on  the  courts  of  the  Baltimore  Country  Club,  Baltimore, 
Md.,  beginning  October  7.  The  event  attracted  large  entry  lists  in  each. 
event  and  resulted  very  satisfactorily.  There  were  fifty-three  entrants  in  the 
singles,  twenty  pairs  in  the  doubles  and  twenty-two  pairs  in  the  mixed  dou- 
bles. The  first  named  event  was  taken  by  Mrs.  J.  Saunders  Taylor  of  Nor- 
folk, who  successfully  came  through  the  tournament  and  then  challenged  the 
title  holder,  Mrs.  Wallace  Hardy,  winning  from  the  latter  in  two  close  sets, 
7/5,  6/4.  Mrs.  Taylor's  play  was  the  feature  of  the  entire  competition;  she 
did  not  lose  a  single  set,  and  never  at  any  time  did  she  appear  to  be  in 
danger.  In  the  challenge  round  the  title  holder  exhibited  some  wonderful 
playing,  but  was  streaky,  while  hvv  adversary  was  unusually  steady.  The- 
doubles  brought  out  Mrs.  Hardy  and  Miss  Katherine  Davis  against  Mrs.  R. 
C.  Stewart  and  Mrs.  J.  Brown,  who  lost,  4/6,  8/6,  6/2.  In  the  mixed  dau-

was  manifested  in  the  competition  for  the  Burcham  Harding  Cup,  played  at

190  SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 


The   Canadian   Championship 

The  open  championships  of  Canada  were  held  in  1912  for  the  first  time 
in  Vancouver,  B.  C,  on  the  courts  of  the  Vancouver  Lawn  Tennis  Club, 
beginning  July  22,  and  despite  frequent  rains,  which  prolonged  the  event, 
it  was  considered  the  greatest  success  that  Northwestern  Canadian  tennis 
has  yet  seen.  The  singles  title  was  retained  by  B.  C.  Schwengers  of 
Victoria,    who    defeated   Joe    Tyler    of    Spokane    in    the    challenge    round.

final  betvi^een  Johnston  and  Fottrell  of  San  Francisco,  and  A.  E.  Jukes

Preliminary  Davis  Cup  Matches  for 
New  York  in  1913 

American  and  Australian  lawn  tennis  teams  are  to  meet  in  the  first  of 
the  preliminary  matches  of  the  international  series  for  the  Dwight  F. 
Davis  Cup  on  the  turf  courts  of  the  West  Side  Tennis  Club,  Broadway 
at  238th  Street,  New  York,  on  Friday,  Saturday  and  Monday,  June  6,. 
7  and  9.  This  was  decided  on  March  28,  at  a  joint  meeting  of  the  inter- 
national committee,  composed  of  Robert  D.  Wrenn,  Henry  W.  Slocum 
and  George  T.  Adee,  with  Orrin  M.  Root  and  Julian  S.  Myrick,  respect- 
ively   president  and    vice-president    of   the    West    Side    organization. 

At  the  close  of  the  meeting,  President  VVrenn  said:  "While  we  are 
deciding  some  minor  details  the  final  action  will  be  deferred  until  the 
arrival  of  the  Australian  team  in  New  York.  We  are  advised  that  Horace 
Rice  and  A.  B.  Jones  will  sail  from  Sydney  to  arrive  in  San  Francisco  on 
April  25.  S.  N.  Doust  is  now  in  London  and  will  arrive  in  America  about 
May    I,   the   same   time   as   the   other  members  of   the   team. 

"There  is  keen  interest  in  the  matches,  and  special  invitation  tourna- 
ments in  the  way  of  exhibition  matches  are  planned  by  the  Tuxedo- 
Racquet  and  Tennis  Club,  the  Piping  Rock  Country  Club  of  Locust  Valley,. 
Long  Island;  the  Longwood  Cricket  Club  of  Boston,  and  others.  As  the' 
Australians  will  have  the  entire  month  of  May  to  devote  to  practice  in 
preparation  for  the  international  cup  matches,  all  of  the  leading  American 
players  in  the  vicinity  of  New  York  desire  to  entertain  them  and  aiford 
them  every  opportunity  to  tune  their  game  up  to  its  highest  pitch.  Of 
course,   the   courts   of  the   West   Side   Club   will   always  be  at   their   disposal. 

"The  American  committee  will  not  decide  upon  the  team  that  will  repre- 
sent this  country  until  after  a  series  of  test  tournaments  have  been  held. 
We  have  sent  out  a  letter  to  ten  of  the  foremost  players  of  this  country^ 
and   will   arrange  the   trial   tournament   as   soon   as    practicable." 

The   letter   sent  by    President  Wrenn   is  as  follows: 

The  committee  appointed  to  take  charge  of  the  Davis  Cup 
matches  this  year  have  under  consideration  the  formation  of  a 
team  to  represent  the  United  States,  and  with  that  in  view 
we  are  sending  this  letter  to  a  number  of  our  ranking  tennis 
players: 

Our  preliminary  tie  against  Australia  will  be  played  in  this 
country  early  in  June,  li  we  win,  the  team  will  play  against 
the  winners  of  France  and  Germany  in  England  about  July  10. 
The  third  round  must  be  completed  by  July  21,  and  the  chal- 
lenge round  against  England  will  be  played  on  July  25,  26 
and  28.  There  will  be  preliminary  practice  matches  arranged 
for  the  team  during  May. 

If  selected  as  a  member  of  our  team,  could  you  so  arrange 
your   plans  as  to   play   both   here   and   abroad   in   these    events? 

(Signed)     Robert   D.   Wrenn. 

It  was  explained  that  the  Australian  Association  had  particularly- 
requested  that  the  matches  be  early  in  June,  so  that  the  trio  from  the 
antipodes  would  be  able  to  leave  the  United  States  in  time  to  compete  in 
the  All-England  championships,  which  will  begin  in  London  on  Monday, 
June  23.  If  the  Americans  should  win  the  series  it  is  not  likely  that  the' 
team  will   leave   this   country   until   July    i.

Annual  Meeting  of  the  U.  S.  N.  L.  T.  A. 


I  The  administrative  forces  of  the  United  States  National  Lawn  Tennis 
Association  met  with  a  setback  at  the  thirty-second  annual  meeting  of  the 
association  in  New  York  City,  February  7,  191 3,  when  the  delegates  faned 
to  pass  the  amateur  rule,  which  was  intended  to  prohibit  players  from 
accepting  transportation  or  money  for  transportation,  or  board,  lodging  or 
(|ther  accommodations  from  any  club,  hotel  or  organization.  The  discussion 
\i/as  a  heated  one,  and  practically  every  delegate  expressed  an  opinion  on 
^he  subject,  and  the  Western  delegates  led  the  opposition, 
i  The  supporters  of  the  proposed  amendment,  led  by  H.  W.  Slocum  and 
L.  D.  Mahan,  earnestly  urged  the  delegates  to  accept  the  change  as  the 
only  means  of  protecting  the  amateur  status  of  the  players.  It  was  urged 
t|hat  the  spirit  of  professionalism  would  eventually  dominate  the  associa- 
tjion.  There  was  considerable  misinterpretation  of  the  rule,  but  the  pro- 
tjtacted  discussion  made  it  plain  to  all  pfesent.  The  motion,  which  required 
a  two-thirds  vote  of  a  total  of  147  votes,  was  lost  by  79  votes  to  68. 
'  The  meeting,  which  was  presided  over  by  President  Robert  D.  Wrenn  of 
1;he  National  Association,  barred  from  playing  under  the  National  Associa- 
tion rules  and  sanction  players  who  are  connected  with  the  sale  of  tennis 
goods  or  with  a  firm  manufacturing  or  selling  tennis  goods. 
:  What  promised  to  be  a  heated  discussion  was  satisfactorily  adjusted 
when  the  question  of  proxy  voting  was  settled  by  permitting  delegates  to 
vote  any  number  of  proxies.  This  was  considered  a  second  victory  for  the 
Western  delegates,  who  were  opposed  to  limiting  the  proxy  votes. 
.  The  question  of  changing  the  constitution  so  as  to  give  the  right  to  vote 
as  many  proxies  as  one  may  desire  was  passed  by  a  vote  of  106  to  43. 
'J'wo-thirds  of  100  votes  were  necessary,  and  the  discussion  aroused  heated 
sectional  debate.  The  result  was  somewhat  of  a  surprise,  as  it  places  the 
Annual   votihg   on   the   old   footing. 

President  Wrenn  was  authorized  to  issue  a  formal  challenge  for  the 
Davis   Interational    Cup,   the   entries  for  which   closed   March    i. 

Among  the  many  amendments  adopted  was  the  lengthening  of  the  shoe 
spike  from  %  to  %  oi  an  inch.  The  Ranking  Committee  was  requested  to 
report  on  the  motion  of  establishing  a  ranking  list  for  women.  The  report 
to   be   submitted  at  the   annual   meeting  in    1914. 

In  order  to  provide  an  amateur  rule  that  will  be  acceptable  to  all  sec- 
tions of  the  country  the  president  was  empowered  to  appoint  a  committee, 
and  the  announcement  for  the  same  must  be  sent  to  every  club  in  the 
association  thirty   days  before  the   next   annual   meeting. 

There  was  little  opposition  for  the  National  championships.  The  effort 
to  have  the  doubles  played  through  the  same  as  the  singles  was  overwhelm- 
ingly defeated. 

The  election  of  the  officers  resulted  as  follows:  President,  Robert  D. 
Wrenn,  New  York  City;  vice-president,  H.  W.  Slocum,  New  York  City; 
treasurer,  Richard  Stevens,  Hoboken,  N.  J.;  secretary,  A.  L.  Hoskins, 
Philadelphia.

SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS     ANNUAl.. 


National  Indoor  Championship 

^yith  more  than  three  score  of  entries  in  the  singles  and  thirty-four  pairs 
nominated  for  the  doubles,  the  National  Indoor  Lawn  Tennis  Champion- 
ship for  1913  opened  auspiciously  on  the  board  floor  courts  of  the  Seventh 
Regiment  Armory,  New  York  City,  February  12.  Gustave  F.  Touchard  of 
the  West  Side  Tennis  Club  won  the  singles  event  when  he  defeated  George 
Carl  Shafer,  a  clubmate,  in  the  final  round,  by  a  score  of  6/4,  3/6,  6/3, 
6/4.  The  victory  of  Touchard  marked  his  second  win  of  the  title,  his 
former   victory   being  in    1909   when  he   defeated   R.   A.    Holden,   Jr. 

In  the  championship  round  of  the  doubles  Wylie  C.  Grant  and  Shafer, 
as  a  pair,  showed  the  way  to  Touchard  and  William  B.  Cragin  in  what 
was  conceded  to  be  a  comparatively  hollow  victory,  the  title  going  to  the 
Grant-Shafer  combination  in  three  straight  sets,  6/2,  6/2,  6/4.  Cragin, 
later,  captured  the  Consolation  singles  by  defeating  Preston  Gumming, 
6/3,  6/1. 

Some  spectacular  tennis  was  witnessed  by  the  large  gallery  when  Tou- 
chard and  Shafer  met  for  the  championship.  The  finish  of  the  ultimate 
winner  in  the  third  and  fourth  sets  was  so  strong  that  even  his  most 
ardent  supporters  had  not  anticipated  such  startling  form.  In  the  third 
set,  with  the  scores  one-all,  and  Shafer  three  games  to  one,  Touchard  came 
through  with  a  bevy  of  placement  plays  which  Shafer  almost  failed  get- 
ting a  sight  of,  so  cleverly  were  they  laid  along  the  side  and  back  court. 
It  was  during  this  latter  stage  of  the  set  that  the  new  champion  won  the 
next  five  games  straight,  in  three  of  which  Shafer  got  but  six  points,  while 
in  the  others  it  went  to  deuce  once,  and  in  the  last  the  latter  got  but  a 
solitary  point. 

This  feat  oP  winning  five  straight  games,  and  these  coming  when  the 
score  stood  four  games  to  one  against  him,  was  accomplished  again  in  the 
concluding  set.  but  with  the  diflFerence  that  during  this  period  Shafer 
gained  only  two  points.  During  the  match  Touchard  was  blanked  in  two 
games,   while   such  a  fate  befell  Shafer   four  times. 

Grant  and  Shafer  defeated  Touchard  and  W.  B.  Cragin  in  the  champion- 
ship round  of  the  doubles.  The  weakness  of  Touchard  was  apparent  in 
the  first  set,  as  he  failed  repeatedly  in  his  returns,  and  lost  several  oppor- 
tunities to  score.  The  old-time  brilliancy  and  dash  was  missing,  and 
as  the   contest   progressed   this   failing   became   more   and   more   apparent. 

It  remained  for  Touchard  and  Cragin  to  reserve  their  best  playing  for 
the  third  and  final  set,  which  was  the  nearest  approach  to  real  champion- 
ship form  shown  in  the  match.  Touchard  gave  indications  of  something 
like  consistent  playing,  but  they  were  short-lived,  and  he  fell  away  again 
as  the  contest  neared  its  end.  The  defeated  pair  actually  led  their  oppo- 
nents at  the  seventh  inning  by  the  score  of  4/3,  and  began  the  eighth 
inning  in  promising  fashion.  This,  however,  proved  the  beginning  of  the 
end,  as  Grant  and  Shafer  pulled  themselves  together  and  ran  out  the  next 
three   aces,  and   with  them   the  match.     The   summaries:

(i)   Clubs. 

(2)  Active  Associations. 

(3)  Allied  Associations. 

Allied  associations  shall  consist  of  associations  of  schools  or  colleges,  but 
such  associations,  if  they  so  desire,  may  become  active  associations  by 
notifying  the  Secretary  of  the  National  Association  and  paying  the  dues 
for  an  active  association.  Active  associations  shall  consist  of  all  associa- 
tions other  than  allied  associations  and  in  each  case  the  limits  of  an  active 
association  shall  necessarily  exclude  to  that  extent  the  limits  of  every  other 
such  association. 

Sec.  2.  An  association  in  either  (2)  or  (3)  shall  consist  of  five  or  more 
individual  clubs,  any  one  of  which  may  or  may  not  be  itself  a  member 
directly  of  the  National  Association.  Each  club  shall  at  all  meetings  be 
entitled  to  one  vote.  Each  active  association  shall  be  entitled  to  two  votes 
and  to  one  additional  vote  for  every  five  clubs  or  fraction  thereof  mem- 
bers of  it  over  ten.  Allied  associations  shall  not  be  entitled  to  any  vote. 
No  club  being  itself  a  member  of  the  National  Association  shall  be  counted 
as  a  member  of  an  active  association  in  determining  the  number  of  votes 
which  may  be  cast  by   such   association. 

Sec.  3.  On  or  before  the  first  day  of  January  in  every  year  each  sub- 
association  shall  send  to  the  Secretary  of  the  National  Association  the 
names  and  addresses  of  its  secretary  and  treasurer  and  a  list  of  clubs 
belonging  to  it  on  December  ist  preceding,  and  each  club  directly  a  mem- 
ber of  the  National  Association  shall  send  to  the  Secretary  of  the  National 
Association  the  names  and  addresses  of  its  secretary  and  treasurer,  holding 
office  on  December  ist  preceding.  The  secretary  of  each  association  shall 
notify  the  Secretary  of  the  National  Association  of  any  changes  in  its 
membership  immediately   upon   their   occurrence. 

ARTICLE  III. 
election  of  members. 

Section  i.  Proposals  for  membership  must  be  made  in  writing  to  the 
Executive  Committee,  hereinafter  provided  for,  with  the  name  and  address 
of  the  applicant,  and  signed  by  the  proper  officer  of  the  club  or  associa- 
tion making  the  proposal,  and  shall  give  such  information  with  regard  to 
membership,  grounds,  etc.,  as  shall  be  required  by  the  Executive  Com- 
mittee. Where  the  applicant  is  an  association,  the  names  and  addresses  of 
each  of  its  members  shall  be  given  with  the  application,  together  with  a 
statement   of  the   limits  that   it   desires   to    represent. 

Sec.  2.  The  Executive  Committee  shall  have  full  power  to  elect  candi- 
dates for  membership,  except  that  no  association  shall  be  deemed  a  mem- 
ber  whose  limits   shall   conflict   with  those   of  any   other   association   until   its 


236  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

election  be  confirmed  by  a  two-thirds  vote  at  the  annual  meeting  of  the 
National  Association,  or  the  associations  upon  whose  limits  it  encroaches 
consent  to  such  encroachment.  The  election  to  membership  of  such  an 
association  automatically  decreases  the  limits  of  other  associations  to  such, 
an  extent   as   shall   preclude   a   conflict    of   limits. 

Sec.  3.  Dues,  etc. — The  annual  dues  to  the  National  Association,  in 
the  case  of  clubs,  shall  be  ten  dollars  ($10)  and  the  case  of  active  asso- 
ciations shall  be  thirty-five  dollars  ($35),  except  that  where  any  such  asso- 
ciation is  composed  of  more  than  ten  clubs  its  annual  dues  shall  in 
addition  be  fifteen  dollars  ($15)  for  every  five  clubs  or  fraction  thereof 
above  ten.  Allied  associations  shall  not  be  required  to  pay  any  annual 
dues.  No  club  or  association  shall  be  allowed  the  privilege  of  a  member 
until  after  its  first  annual  dues  have  been  paid  and  no  club  shall  be 
entitled  to  a  vote  at  the  annual  meeting  of  the  National  Association  unless 
it  was  a  member  thereof  for  tfce  preceding  fiscal  year.  The  fiscal  year  of 
the  National  Association  shall  begin  February  ist.  All  dues  for  the  ensu- 
ing year   are   payable  on   or  before   May    ist. 

Sec.  4.  Limits  of  Payments,  etc. — Any  club  or  association  which  shall 
fail  to  have  paid  its  annual  dues  on  or  before  June  ist  may  be  debarred 
from  the  privileges  of  a  member  by  the  Executive  Committee  until  the 
same  are  paid,   and,   at  their   discretion,   may  be   dropped  from  the   roll. 

ARTICLE  IV. 

RESIGNATIONS,    EXPULSIONS,    ETC. 

Section  i.  Resignations,  etc. — Any  member  wishing  to  resign  must  do 
so  in  writing,  addressed  to  the  Secretary;  and  the  resignation  cannot  be 
accepted  until  all  dues  for  the  current  fiscal  year  are  paid.  Resignations 
must  be  received  before  February  ist  to  relieve  the  member  from  payment 
of  dues   for   the   ensuing  year. 

Sec.  2.  The  Executive  Committee  of  the  National  Association,  herein- 
after provided  for,  shall  have  the  power  to  suspend  or  expel  any  member 
which  may  neglect  or  refuse  a  strict  and  honorable  compliance  with  its 
Constitution,  By-Laws,  etc.,  or  which  shall,  by  its  conduct,  bring  reproach 
or  disgrace  upon  the  National  Association;  or  which  shall,  being  itself  an 
association,  retain  as  one  of  its  members  any  club  objected  to  by  notice  in 
writing  by  the  Executive  Committee,  subject  to  the  right  of  any  member, 
if  expelled,  to  appeal  to  the  National  Association,  at  its  next  annual

THE  COURT. 
1.  The  Court  is  78  feet  long  and  27  feet  wide.  It  is  divided  across 
the  middle  by  a  net,  the  ends  of  which  are  attached  to  two  posts, 
A  and  B,  standing  3  feet  outside  of  the  court  on  either  side.  The 
height  of  the  net  is  3  feet  6  inches  at  the  posts,  and  3  feet  in  the 
middle.     At  each  end  of  the  court,  parallel  with  the  net,  and  39  feet

from  it,  are  drawn  the  base  lines  D  E  and  P  G,  the  ends  of  which 
are  connected  by  the  side  lines  D  F  and  E  G.  Halfway  between  the 
side  lines,  and  parallel  with  them,  is  drawn  the  half  court  line  I  H, 
dividing  the  space  on  each  side  of  the  net  into  two  equal  parts,  the 
right  and  left  courts.  On  each  side  of  the  net,  at  a  distance  of  21 
feet  from  it,  and  parallel  with  it,  are  drawn  the  service  lines  K  L  and 
M  N. 

THE    BALLS. 

2.  The  Balls  shall  measure  not  less  than  21/2  inches,  nor  more  than 
2  9-16  inches  in  diameter  ;  and  shall  weigh  not  less  than  1  15-16 
ounces,  nor  more  than  2  ounces. 

THE    GAME. 

3.  The  choice  of  sides,  and  the  right  to  serve  in  the  first  game, 
shall  be  decided  by  toss ;,  provided  that,  if  the  winner  of  the  toss 
choose  the  right  to  serve,  the  other  player  shall  have  choice  of  sides, 
and  vice  versa,  or  the  winner  of  the  toss  may  insist  upon  a  choice  by 
his  opponent.  If  one  player  choose  the  court,  the  other  may  elect 
not  to  serve.  .  „    ,  ,,        , 

4.  The  players  shall  stand  on  opposite  sides  of  the  net ;  the  player 
who  first  delivers  the  ball  shall  be  called  the  server,  and  the  other  the 
striker-out.  .,  ^    ,    ,,  . 

5  At  the  end  of  the  first  game  the  striker-out  shall  become  server, 
and  the  server  shall  become  striker-out ;  and  so  on  alternately  in  all 
the  subsequent  games  of  the  set  and  following  sets. 

6  The  server  shall  serve  with  both  feet  behind,  i.  e.,  further  from 
the  net  than  the  base  line  and  within  the  limits  of  the  imaginary 
continuation  of  the  centre  service  and  the  side  lines.  It  is  not  a 
fault  if  one  onlp  of  the  server's  feet  do  not  touch  the  ground  at  the 
moment  at  which  the  service  is  delivered.  He  shall  place  both  feet 
upon  the  ground  immediately  before  serving  and  shall  not  take  a  run- 
ning nor  a  walking  start.  He  shall  deliver  the  service  from  the  right 
and  left  courts  alternately,  beginning  from  the  right,  in  each  of  Ms 
service  games,  even  though  odds  he  given  or  owed. 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL.  243 

7.  The  ball  served  must  drop  between  the  service  line,  naif-court 
line,  and  the  side  line  of  the  court,  diagonally  opposite  to  that  from 
which  it  was  served. 

8.  It  is  a  Fault  if  the  ball  served  drop  in  the  net,  or  beyond  the 
service  line,  or  out  of  court,  or  in  the  wrong  court ;  or  if  the  server 
do  not  stand  as  directed  by  law  6.  If  the  server,  in  attempting  to 
serve,  mjss  the  ball  altogether,  it  does  not  count  a  fault,  but  if  the 
ball  be  touched,  no  matter  how  slightly,  by  the  racket,  a  service  is 
thereby  delivered,  and  the  laws  governing  the  service  at  once  apply. 

9.  A  fault  cannot  be  taken. 

10.  After  a  fault  the  server  shall  serve  again  from  the  same  court 
from  which  he  served  that  fault,  unless  it  was  a  fault  because  he 
served  from  the  wrong  court. 

11.  A  fault  cannot  be  claimed  after 'the  next  service  is  delivered. 

12.  The  server  shall  not  serve  until  the  striker-out  is  ready.  If 
the  latter  attempt  to  return  the  service,  he  shall  be  deemed  ready. 

13.  A  service  or  fault  delivered  M^hen  the  striker-out  is  not  ready 
counts  for  nothing. 

14.  Ttie  service  shall  not  be  volleyed,  that  is,  taken,  before  it  has 
touched  the  ground. 

15.  A  ball  is  in  play  on  leaving  the  server's  racket,  except  as  pro- 
vided for  in  law  8,  and  remains  in  play  till  the  stroke  is  decided. 

16.  It  is  a  good  return,  although  the  ball  touch  the  net ;  but  a 
service,  otherwise  good,  which  touches  the  net  shall  count  for  nothing. 

17.  The  server  wins  a  stroke  if  the  striker-out  volley  the  service, 
or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  service  or  the  ball  in  play,  or  if  he  return 
the  service  or  the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  oppo- 
nent's court :  or  if  he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke,  as  provided  by  law  20. 

18.  The  striker-out  wins  a  stroke  if  the  server  serve  two  consecu- 
tive faults  :  or  if  he  fail  to  return  the  ball  in  play  ;  or  if  he  return 
the  ball  in  play  so  that  it  drops  outside  of  his  opponent's  court ;  or  if 
he  otherwise  lose  a  stroke  as  provided  by  law  20. 

19.  A  ball  falling  on  a  line  is  regarded  as  falling  in  the  court 
>ounded  by  that  line. 

20.  Either  olayer  loses  a  stroke  if  the  ball  touch  him,  or  anything 
I  that  he  wears  or  carries,  except  his  racket  in  the  act  of  striking  ;  or 
/  if  he  touch  the  ball  with  his  racket  more  than  once  ;  or  if  he  touch 
/  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports  while  the  ball  is  in  play  ;  or  if  he  volley 
y   the  ball  before  it  has  passed  the  net. 

\^  21.  In  case  a  player  is  obstructed  by  any  accident,  not  within  his 
control,  the  ball  shall  be  considered  a  "let."  But  when  a  permanent 
fixture  of  the  court  is  the  cause  of  the  accident,  the  point  shall  be 
counted.  The  benches  and  chairs  placed  around  the  court  shall  be 
considered  permanent  fixtures.  If,  however,  a  ball  in  play  strike  a 
permanent  fixture  of  the  court  (other  than  the  net  or  posts)  before 
it  touches  the  ground,  the  point  is  lost ;  if  after  it  has  touched  the 
ground,  the  point  shall  be  counted. 

22.  On  either  player  winning  his  first  stroke,  the  score  is  called  15 
for  that  player :  on  either  player  winning  his  second  stroke,  the 
score  is  called  30  for  that  player;  on  either  player  winning  his  third 
stroke,  the  score  is  called  40  for  that  player  ;  and  the  fourth  stroke 
won  by  either  player  is  scored  game  for  the  player,  except  as  below. 
If  both  players  have  won  three  strokes,  the  score  is  called  deuce;  and 
the  next  stroke  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  for  that 
player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  stroke,  he  wins  the  game  ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  stroke  the  score  returns  to  deuce,  and  so  on  until 
one  player  wins  the  two  strokes  immediately  following  the  score  of 
deuce,  when  game  is  scored  for  that  player. 

23.  The  player  who  first  wins  six  games  wins  the  set ;  except  as 
below:  If  both  players  win  five  games  the  score  is  called  games  all; 
and  the  next  game  won  by  either  player  is  scored  advantage  game  for 


/:: 


244  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

that  player.  If  the  same  player  win  the  next  game,  he  wins  the  set ; 
if  he  lose  the  next  game,  the  score  returns  to  games  all  ;  and  so  on, 
until  either  player  wins  the  two  games  immediately  following  the 
score  of  games  all,  when  he  wins  the  set.  But  the  committee  having 
charge  of  any  tournament  may  in  their  discretion  modify  this  rule 
by  the  omission  of  advantage  sets. 

24.  The  players  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first,  third 
and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  each  set  and  at  the  end  of 
each  set,  unless  the  number  of  games  in  such  set  be  even.  It  shall, 
however,  be  open  to  the  players  by  mutual  consent  and  notification 
to  the  umpire  before  the  opening  of  the  second  game  of  the  match  to 
change  sides  instead  at  the  end  of  every  set  until  the  odd  and  con- 
cluding set,  in  which  they  shall  change  sides  at  the  end  of  the  first, 
third  and  every  subsequent  alternate  game  of  such  set. 

*25.  In  all  contests  the  play  shall  be  continuous  from  the  first 
service  till  the  match  be  concluded  ;  provided,  however,  that  at  the 
end  of  the  third  set  either  player  is  entitled  to  a  rest,  which  shall 
not  exceed  seven  minutes,  and  provided,  further,  that  in  case  of  an 
unavoidable  accident,  not  within  the  control  of  the  contestants,  a 
cessation  of  play  which  shall  not  exceed  two  minutes  may  be  allowed 
between  points  ;  but  this  proviso  shall  be  strictly  construed,  and  the 
privilege  never  granted  for  the  purpose  of  allowing  a  player  to  recover 
his  strength  or  wind.  The  referee  in  his  discretion  may  at  any  time 
postpone  the  match  on  account  of  darkness  or  condition  of  the  ground 
or  weather.  In  any  case  of  postponement,  the  previous  score  shall 
hold  good.  Where  the  play  has  ceased  for  more  than  an  hour,  the 
player  who  at  the  cessation  thereof  was  in  the  court  fir^t  chosen  shall 
have  the  choice  of  courts  on  the  recommencement  of  play.  He  shall 
stay  in  the  court  he  chooses  for  the  remainder  of  the  set.  The  last 
two  sentences  of  this  rule  do  not  apply  when  the  players  change  every 
alternate  game  as  provided  by  law  24. 

26.  If  a  player  serve  out  of  his  turn,  the  umpire,  as  soon  as  the 
mistake  is  discovered,  shall  direct  the  player  to  serve  who  ought  to 
have  served.  But  all  strokes  scored  before  such  discovery  shall  be 
counted.  If  a  game  shall  have  been  completed  before  such  discovery, 
then  the  service  m  the  next  alternate  game  shall  be  delivered  by  the 
player  who  did  not  serve  out  of  his  turn,  and  so  on  in  regular  rotation. 

27.  The  above  laws  shall  apply  to  the  three-handed  and  four- 
handed  games,  except  as  below  : 

THE  THREE-HANDED  AND  FOUR-HANDED  GAMES. 

28.  For  the  three-handed  and  four-handed  games  the  court  shall 
be  36  feet  in  width;  4%  feet  inside  the  side  lines,  and  parallel  with 
them,  are  drawn  the  service  side  lines  K  M  and  L  N.  The  service 
lines  are  not  drawn  beyond  the  point  at  which  they  meet  the  service 
side  lines,  as  shown  in  the  diagram. 

29.  In  the  three-handed  game,  the  single  player  shall  serve  in 
every  alternate  game. 

30.  In  the  four-handed  game,  the  pair  who  have  the  right  to  serve 
in  the  first  game  shall  decide  which  partner  shall  do  so.  and  the  op- 
posing pair  shall  decide  in  like  m.anner  for  the  second  game.  The 
partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  first  game  shall  serve  in  the  third, 
and  the  partner  of  the  player  who  served  in  the  second  game  shall 
serve  in  the  fourth,  and  the  same  order  shall  be  maintained  ih  all  the 
subsequent  games  of  the  set. 

31.  At   the   beginning  of  the  next  set,    either  partner  of  the  pair 


*  All  matches  in  which  women  take  part  in  tournaments  held  under  the 
auspices  of  the  United  States  National  Lawnn  Tenis  Association  shall  be  the  best

which  struck  out  in  the  last  game  of  the  last  set  may  serve  ;  and  the 
same  privilege  is  given  to  their  opponents  in  second  gam©  of  the  new 
set. 

32.  TTie  players  shall  take  the  service  alternately  throughout  the

33.  It  is  a  fault  if  the  ball  served  does  not  drop  between  the  service 
line,  half-court  line,  and  service  side  line  of  the  court,  diagonally 
opposite  to  that  from  which  it  was  served.

decisions  on  Doubtful  Points 

Offtcially  recognized  hy  the  U.  8.  N.  L.  T.  A. 

I  A  player  standing  outside  tlie  court  volleys  the  ball  or  catches 
it  in  his  hand,  and  claims  the  stroke  because  the  ball  was  certainly 
going  out  of  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.     It  makes  no  difference  where 
he  was  standing.     The  return  is  presumed  good  until  it  strikes 
V.^^^^^   the  ground  outside  of  the  court. 

II.  '  A  player  is  struck  by  the  ball  served  before  it  has  touched 
the  ground,  he  being  outside  of  the  service  court.     How  does  it  count  V 

Decision. — The  player  struck  loses  the  stroke.  The  service  is 
presumably  good  until  it  strikes  in  the  wrong  court.  A  player 
cannot  take  the  decision  upon  himself  by  stopping  the  ball.  If 
it  is  going  to  be  a  fault,  he  has  only  to  get  out  of  the  way. 

III.  The  service  is  delivered  before  the  striker-out  is  ready.  He 
tries  to  return  it  and  fails.    Is  he  entitled  to  have  it  played  over  again? 

Decision. — No.     If   he   attempts   to   return  the   service   he   is 

deemed  ready. 

•IV.     The   striker-out  calls   "not  ready,"   for  a   second  service.     The 

ball  strikes  beyond  the  service  line,  and  the  striker-out  claims  that  the 

fact  that  he  was  not  ready  makes  no  difference,  since  a  fault  cannot 

be  returned,  and,  therefore,  that  two  faults  have  been  served. 

Decision. — The    second   service    goes    for    nothing.      A    player 

cannot  call   "Not   ready,"   and   then   have  the  service   count,   or 

not,  as  suits  his  interests. 

v.     A  ball   having  been   played   over  the  net  bounds   back   into  the 

court  from  which  it  came.     The  player  reaches  over  the  net  and  plays 

it  before  it  fall.     Has  he  a  right  to  do  soV 

Decision. — Yes,  provided  he  does  not  touch  the  net.  He  has 
a  right  to  play  the  ball  at  any  time  from  the  moment  it  crosses 
the  net  into  his  court  until  it  touches  the  ground  a  second  time. 

VI.  A  ball  is  played  into  the  net ;  the  player  on  the  other  side, 
thinking  that  the  ball  is  coming  over,  strikes  at  it  and  hits  the  net. 
Who  loses  the  stroke? 

Decision. — It  is  simply  a  question  of  fact  for  the  umpire  to 
decide.  If  the  player  touch  the  net  while  the  ball  was  still  in 
play  he  loses  the  stroke. 

VII.  Can  a  player  follow  a  ball  over  the  net  with  his  racket,  pro- 
vided that  he  hits  the  ball  on  his  own  side  of  the  net? 

Decision. — 'Yes,  the  only  restrictions  are  that  he  shall  not 
volley  the  ball  until  it  has  crossed  the  net,  and  that  he  shall 
not  touch  the  net  or  any  of  its  supports. 

VIII.  A  player's  racket  slips  out  of  his  hand  and  flies  into  the 
net.     Does  he  lose  the  stroke  for  hitting  the  net? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  the  ball  be  still  in  play.  It  does  not  mat- 
ter if  the  racket  be  in  a  player's  hand  or  not. 

IX.  A  player's  racket  leaves  his  hand,  but  meets  the  ball  and  re- 
turns it  over  the  net.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes.  There  is  no  law  requiring  a  racket  to  be  in 
a  player's  hand  when  the  ball  is  returned.  It  would  unques- 
tionably be  a  good  return  if  the  racket  were  held  against  the 
ground  by  a  player's  feet,  and  the  ball  bounded  back  off  of  it. 

X.  A  single  match  is  played  with  a  double  net  and  inside  posts.  A 
player  touches   the   net   beyond   the    inside  posts,  and  claims   that  he 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.   .  247 

does   not    lose   the   stroke   because   there    should   be  no  net  more  than 

three  feet  outside  of  the  court. 

Decision. — He  loses  the  stroke.  The  net  where  he  touches  it 
is  part  of  the  supports  of  the  net.  He  might,  perhaps,  have 
objected  to  the  arrangement  of  the  net  before  the  match. 

XI.  A  player  returns  the  ball,  and,  finding  that  he  cannot  stop- 
himself  before  reaching  the  net,  jumps  over  it.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Law  4  requires  that  "the  players  shall  stand  on. 
opposite  sides  of  the  net,"'  and  therefore  the  player  invading- 
his  opponent's  court  loses  the  stroke. 

XII.  A  ball  passes  outside  the  post  of  the  net  and  strikes  in  court. 
Is  it  a  good  return  ? 

,  Decision. — Yes. 

(      XIII.     A  ball   going  out  of  court  hits  the  top  of  the  posts  of  the 
\net  and  bounds  into   the   opposite  court. 
\ ^         Decision. — It  is  a  good  return. 

XIV.  TTie  service  or  the  ball  in  play  strikes  a  ball  lying  in  the- 
court.     Can  it  be  returned? 

Decision. — Yes,  if  it  is  clear  to  the  umpire  that  the  right  ball 
is  returned. 

XV.  The  server  claims  that  the  striker-out  must  stand  in  the  court. 
Is  this  necessary? 

Decision. — No.  The  striker-out  can  stand  wherever  he  please* 
on  his  own  side  of  the  net. 

XVI.  A  bystander  gets  in  the  way  of  a  player  who  fails  to  return 
the  ball.     May  he  then  claim  a  let? 

Decision. — Yes,  if,  in  the  umpire's  opinion,  he  was  prevented 
by  an  accident  beyond  his  control.  For  instance,  if  the  ropes 
or  the  seats  are  allowed  to  be  so  near  to  the  court  that  a  player 
is  interfered  with  by  them,  the  stroke  should  not  be  played 
again,  because  the  ropes  and  seats  form  part  of  the  arrange- 
ments of  the  ground.  If,  however,  a  spectator  passes  in  front 
of  those  seats,  or  places  a  chair  nearer  than  the  original  line, 
and  so  interferes  with  a  player,  the  stroke  should  be  played 
again. 

XVII.  A  player  is  interfered  with  as  above,  and  the  umpire  directs- 
the  stroke  to  be  played  again.  T'he  server  had  previously  served  & 
fault.     He  claims  the  right  to  two  services. 

Decision. — The  fault  stands.  A  let  does  not  annul  a  previous 
fault. 

XVIII.  A  return  hits  the  umpire,  or  his  chair  or  stand,  the  player 
claims  that  the  ball  was  going  into  court. 

Decision. — Stroke  is  lost. 

XIX.  A  player  receiving  fifteen  serves  from  the  left  court.  His 
opponent  claims  a  fault. 

Decision. — It  is  a  fault.  The  service  starts  from  the  right 
court  under  all  circumstances. 

XX.  At  fifteen-all  the  server  by  mistake  serves  from  the  left  court, 
he  wins  the  stroke  and  serves  again  (a  fault),  the  mistake  is  then 
discovered.  Is  he  entitled  to  the  previous  fault?  From  which  court 
should  he  serve  next? 

Decision. — The  previous  stroke  stands.  A  fault  cannot  be 
claimed  after  the  next  service,  good  or  not,  is  delivered.  The 
next  service  should  be  from  the  left  court,  the  score  being- 
thirty-fifteen,  and  the  server  has  served  one  fault. 

XXI.  A  player  serves  from  the  wrong  court,  he  loses  the  stroke, 
and  then  claims  that  it  was  a  fault. 

Decision. — If  the  stroke  was  played  in  his  first  service  it  i& 


248  SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS   ANNUAL. 

bimply  a  fault,  but  if  he  serves  twice  into  ttie  wrong  court  lie 
has  served  two  faults,  and  lost  the  stroke. 

XXII.  The  score  is  five  games  all,  and  the  umpire  directs  the  play- 
ers to  play  an  advantage  set.  The  advantage  game  has  been  won, 
when  it  is  discovered  that  no  advantage  sets  are  to  be  played.  Wliat 
is  to  be  done? 

Decision. — The  set  is  won  at  the  eleventh  game.  It  is  no 
part  of  the  umpire's  duty  to  decide  on  the  conditions  of  the 
matches. 

XXIII.  A  player  serves.  He  hears  the  umpire  call,  but  cannot 
hear  what  he  says.  He  knows  that  the  only  two  things  that  the 
umpire  should  call  are  "fault"  and  "let,"  and  that  in  neither  case  can 
the  ball  be  in  play.  He,  therefore,  does  not  return  it,  only  to  find 
that  the  umpire  has   called   "play."     Has  he  any   redress? 

Decision. — ^]So. 

XXIV.  The  umpire  calls  "fault,"  and  then  instantly  changes  and 
says  "play."  The  striker-out  fails  to  return  the  ball,  and  he  claims 
he  was  prevented  by  the  umpire,  and  also  that  the  umpire  cannot 
change  his  decision. 

Decision. — Ttie  umpire  should  call  a  let  and  the  service  be 
taken  again. 

XXV.  A  ball  drops  near  a  line,  the  player  appeals,  and  the  umpire 
calls  "play."  The  player  misunderstands  the  call  and  lets  the  ball 
fall.     He  then  claims  to  have  the  stroke  played  again. 

Decision. — The  stroke  stands. 
XXVI.     The   ball   strikes   the   ground  close  to   a   line  ;   the   scorer 
scores  the  stroke  against  the  striker.     On  appeal  to  the  linesman,  the 
latter  decided  that  the  ball  was  not  out.     Which  decision  stands? 

Decision. — The  scorer  has  no  right  to  consider  a  ball  out 
until  the  linesman  has  called  to  that  effect,  therefore,  the  deci- 
sion of  the  latter  must  be  accepted.  The  decision  of  a  lines- 
man affecting  his  own  line  is  final. 

XXVII.  A  return  strikes  the  cord  running  along  the  bottom  of  the 
net  and  bounds  over.     Is  it  a  good  return? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXVIII.  During  play  a  ball  is  thrown  into  court,  and  the  ball  in 
play  strikes  it  or  a  player  steps  on  it.     May  a  let  be  claimed? 

Decision. — Yes. 

XXIX.  The  server's  first  service  strikes  his  partner.  Does  he  lose 
the  stroke  or  is  it  a  fault? 

Decision. — A  fault. 

XXX.  A  player  serves  a  fault  and  it  is  then  discovered  that  it  is 
his  partner's  service.     Does  the  fault  stand? 

DecisioHf — Yes. 

XXXI.  In  a  four-handed  competition  one  player  does  not  appear 
in  time  to  play,  and  his  partner  claims  to  be  allowed  to  play  single- 
handed  against  the  opposing  pair.     May  he  do  so? 

Decision. — No. 


UNOFFICIAL  DECISIONS  ON  DOUBTFUL  POINTS. 
(From  Lawn  Tennis.) 
Both    of   the   opponents    of   the   servers   in   doubles   are   strikers-out 
alternately  during  a  game.     It  is  optional  with  them  which  shall  serve 
first,  but  they  must  serve  alternately  thi-oughout  each  set. 

A  player  does  not  lose  a  stroke  for  striking  at  a  ball  that  ulti- 
mately falls  outside  his  court,  providing  he  does  not  touch  it  \a 
doing  so. 


SPALDING'S   LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  249 

If  one  partner  of  a  double  team  strikes  at  a  ball  and  does  a»t 
touch  it,  his  partner  still  has  the  right  to  return  it.  A  player  or 
different  member  of  a  team  may  strike  at  a  ball  as  often  as  they 
please  ;  it  is  still  in  play  until  hit. 

A  served  ball  is  only  a  "let"  if  otherwise  good,  falling  in  the  proper 
court ;  a  fault  cannot  be  a  "let." 

The  server  must  stand  behind  the  base-line,  within  the  limits  of  the 
side-lines  of  the  court  in  which  he  is  playing. 

There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of  "let"  balls  that  may  be  made 
on  the  service,  and  the  server  continues  serving  in  the  same  court 
until  a  good  service  is  delivered  or  two  faults  are  made. 

The  server  must  wait  until  the  striker-out  is  ready  for  the  second 
service  as  well  as  the  first,  and  if  the  striker-out  claims  to  be  not 
ready  and  does  not  make  any  effort  to  return  the  second  service,  the 
server  cannot  claim  the  point,  even  though  the  service  was  good. 

If  a  player's  racket  touches  the  net  after  the  ball  has  struck  the 
net,  he  does  not  lose  the  point.  The  ball  is  dead  and  the  point  has 
been  won  and  lost  as  soon  as  the  ball  strikes  the  net.  and  -nothiag 
which  happens  afterward  can  affect  that  point.  If  the  ball  knocks 
the  net  against  the  player's  racket  the  same  decision  holds  good ; 
it  is  simply  a  question  for  the  referee  to  decide  which  touches  the 
net  first. 

In  doubles  partners  must  receive  throughout  each  set  on  the  same 
sides  of  the  court  which  they  originally  select  when  the  set  begins. 
The  first  server  is  not  required  to  receive  in  the  right  court ;  he  may 
select  either  side  at  the  beginning  of  the  set,  but  must  hold  this  to 
the  end. 

A  ball  served  with  a  sharp  cut  that  bounds  back  over  the  net  after 
having  struck  in  the  right  court  is  a  good  service.  T'he  point  counts 
.In  favor  of  tne  server  if  the  striker-out  fails  to  return  it.  The  latter 
may  reach  over  the  net  to  return  the  ball,  but  loses  the  point  if  he 
touches  the  net  in  doing  so. 

A  return  made  from  one  side  of  the  court  that  passes  outside  of  the 
net  and  posts  without  going  over  them  is  still  good  if  thf>  ball  falls 
in  the  proper  court. 

The  ball  is  always  in  play  until  it  has  struck  the  ground  outside 
of  the  court,  or  the  net,  or  has  touched  the  ground  twice.  The  player 
loses  a  point  if  the  ball  touches  him  or  his  clothing  while  still  in  play, 
no  matter  whether  he  is  standing  outside  of  the  court  when  the  ball 
liits  him,  or  not. 

An  officially  recognized  decision  has  been  rendered  that  makes  any 
support  of  the  net — the  posts,  the  guy-ropes,  or  the  centre  fork — a 
part  of  the  net  itself,  and  any  ball  hitting  one  of  the  supports  and 
still  striking  the  right  court  is  considered  a  good  return  (except  on 
the  service).  The  posts  are  required  to  stand  outside  of  the  court, 
and  yet  a  ball  being  returned  at  a  sharp  angle  from  outside  might 
well  be  going  in  and  still  touch  one  of  the  posts. 

A  ball  is  dead  the  instant  it  has  touched  the  ground  outside  of  the 
court,  and  the  point  must  be  scored  at  once  against  the  other  side, 
no  matter  what  happens  after  the  ball  touches  the  ground. 

Consolation  matches  in  America  are  always  open  to  arwr  player 
beaten  in  his  first  match  actually  played.  Winning  by  default  before 
defeat  in  the  first  actual  match  does  not  disqualify  a  player  from 
the  consolation  event. 

The  services  must  always  come  alternately  from  the  right  and  left 
courts  ;  if  the  server  delivers  the  ball  from  the  wrong  court  it  is  a 
fault. 

A  fault  cannot  be  played,  and  the  striker-out  has  no  option  in  the 
matter ;  it  does  not  make  the  service  good  if  he  returns  it.

9.     It  is  the  duty  of  an  Umpire —

The  Scoring  Sheet  shows  that  in  the  first  game  the  score  ran,  and  would 
have  been  called,  thus:  "15 — love,  30 — love,  30 — 15,  40 — 15,  40 — 30,  game 
(A.B.)"  In  the  second  game:  "Love— 15,  15  all,  15—30,  30  all,  40—30, 
deuce,  advantage  (CD.),  deuce,  advantage  (A.B.),  deuce,  advantage  (CD.), 
game   (CD.)." 

The  score  of  the  Server  should  be  called  first. 

NOTE — At  the  end  of  each  game  the  games  should  be  called  with  the 
name  of  the  player  who  is  in  advance,  thus:  "2  games  to  1,  B  wins"  or, 
"B  leads."  If  the  games  are  level  the  score  should  be  called  thus,  "three- 
games  all,"  or  as  the  case  may  be.  At  the  end  of  each  set  the  sets  should 
be  called  in  like  manner.

When  two  players  in  different  classes  below  scratch  meet,  the  su- 
perior player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  received  by  the 
inferior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table  No.  1.  To  use  the 
table,  find  in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures  the  number  representing  the 
class  of  the  superior  player,  then  travel  along  the  horizontal  column 
until  the  vertical  column  is  reached  which  bears  at  the  top  the  num- 
ber of  the  class  of  the  inferior  player.  The  odds  specified  at  the  in- 
tersection of  the  two  columns  are  the  odds  required. 

Example. — If  class  3  has  to  meet  class  9,  start  from  the  figure  3 
in  the  diagonal  line  of  figures,  and  look  horizontally  until  the  vertical 
column  is  reached  headed  by  the  figure  9.  The  odds  given  at  the  point 
of  intersection  of  the  two  columns  (viz.  15  and  1-6  of  15)  are  the 
odds  required. 

When  the  difference  betweeji  the  best  and  the  worst  players  en- 
tered in  great  (say  more  than  30),  it  is  desirable  to  handicap  the

When  the  two  players  in  different  classes  above  scratch  meet,  the 
inferior  player  shall  start  from  scratch,  and  the  odds  owed  by  the 
superior  player  are  as  shown  by  the  annexed  table.  No.  2. 

This  table  is  to  be  used  in  the  same  way  as  the  former,  the  class 
of  the  superior  player  being  looked  for  in  the  horizontal  line  of  fig- 
ures at  the  top,  and  the  class  of  the  inferior  player  in  the  diagonal 
line  of  figures. 

Example. — If  class  12  (owe  30)  meet  class  7  (owe  15  and  1-6  of 
15),   the  former  must  owe  the  latter  the  odds  of  4-6  of  15. 

21.  In  Championship  matches  and  handicaps  by  classes,  as  above, 
advantage  sets  shall  be  played  throughout. 

22.  Tbe  Committee  may,  whether  appealed  to  by  any  competitor 
or  not,  postpone  the  meeting  or  any  match  or  part  of  a  match  if,  in 
their  opinion,  the  state  of  the  weather,  or  of  the  light,  or  the  condi-

so.     In  cases  of  postponement,  Law  25  must  be  strictly  observed.

for  fivo-sixths  and  one  stroke  on  each  of  the  others. 

Thirty    (30)    is  two  strokes  on  each  game. 

Thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1).  thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty 
^nd  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half-forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4), 
thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and  forty  (40),  are  three  strokes  and 
two  given  on  the  corresponding  games  of  each  set,  as  in  the  fifteen 
series. 

OWED    ODDS. 

Owed  (or  mijuus)  oddsi  can  also  be  used  in  exactly  the  same  quanti- 
ties, the  chief  difference  being  that  the  better  player  is  required  to 
earn  the  owed  strokes  before  he  begins  to  score,  while,  in  the  case  of 
given  odds,  the  poorer  player  is  given  his  handicap  before  play  starts. 
TTiese  owed  odds  may  be  used  either  in  conjunction  with  the  given  odds

SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  261 

or  separately.  In  order  that  the  handicaps  may  occur  as  seldom  as-- 
possible  in  the  same  games,  when  two  players  meet,  one  of  whom  owes 
odds  and  the  other  receives  them,  the  games  on  which  owed  strokes- 
are  paid  differ  from  those  on  which,  the  given  strokes  are  taken. 
Here  is  the  table  for  owed  odds  : 

One-sixth  (1-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  seventh,  thirteentli. 
and  every  subsequent  sixth  game  in  each  set. 

Two-sixths  (2-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  seventh,, 
ninth  and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Three-sixths  (3-6  or  one-half)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,. 
fifth  and  every  other  alternate  game  in  each  set. 

Four-sixths  (4-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fifth,  sixth, 
and  corresponding  games  in  each  set. 

Five-sixths  (5-6)  is  one  stroke  owed  on  the  first,  third,  fourth,  fifths 
sixth  and  corresponding  games   in  each  set. 

Fifteen   (15)   is  one  stroke  owed  on  each  game. 

Fifteen  and  one-sixth  (15.1),  fifteen  and  two-sixths  (15.2).  fifteen 
and  three  sixths  (15.3  or  half-thirty),  fifteen  and  four-sixths  (15.4), 
fifteen  and  five-sixths  (15.5),  thirty  (30),  thirty  and  one-sixth  (30.1), 
thirty  and  two-sixths  (30.2),  thirty  and  three-sixths  (30.3  or  half- 
forty),  thirty  and  four-sixths  (30.4),  thirty  and  five-sixths  (30.5)  and 
forty  (40),  correspond  to  the  fractions  of  fifteen,  as  do  the  larger 
handicaps  in  the  table  for  given  odds  correspond  to  the  fractions  of 
fifteen  in  that  table. 

The  simplest  method  for  handioappers  to  pursue  is  to  sort  out  the 
entries  for  the  event  they  are  to  handicap  into  classes  according  to 
the  relative  skill  of  the  players.  Then  select  the  class  with  the  great- 
est number  of  players  in  it  and  place  them  on  scratch,  handicapping 
all  of  the  other  players  either  behind  or  in  advance  of  scratch  by 
owed  or  given  odds,  so  as  to  make  all  even  at  the  odds. 

In  deciding  upon  each  player's  handicap,  his  ability  as  compared 
with  the  scratch  men  should  first  be  considered,  and  then  as  compared 
with  his  nearest  and  furthest  rivals  in  the  tables  of  odds.  Each 
player  might  meet  any  of  the  others,  and  the  object  of  handicapping 
is  to  give  him  an  exactly  even  chance,  no  matter  whom  his  opponent 
may   be. 

It  should  be  remembered  that  it  is  easier  to  owe  15,  or  any  fraction 
of  it,  than  it  is  to  give  it,  and  when  odds  of  30  are  given,  the  poorer 
player's  score  has  already  reached  pretty  near  the  end  of  the  game, 
and  the  difference  between  him  and  the  best  men  must  be  very  great 
to  give  the  latter  an  even  chance,  should  they  meet. 

It  is  very  unwise  to  give  even  the  poorer  players  over  30.3  (half- 
forty),  and  very  seldom  is  it  safe  to  make  the  given  odds  run  higher 
than  30.  If  the  difference  between  the  best  and  the  poorest  players; 
Is  very  great,  place  the  latter  as  far  as  necessary  behind  scratch,  but. 
do  not  advance  the  former  to  more  than  30,  or  30.3  in  the  most  ex- 
treme cases. 


HOW  TO  CONDUCT  A  TOURNAMENT. 

A  tournament  committee  should  first  of  all  be  selected,  with  not 
less  than  five  men  and  as  many  as  possible  practical  workers  who 
have  the  time  and  inclination  to  closely  look  after  the  interests  of  the 
club.  At  its  first  meeting,  the  cojamittee  should  decide  upon  all  de- 
tails of  the  meeting.  In  selecting  a  date,  it  is  advisable  to  choose 
one  immediately  before  or  after  some  established  tournament  in  the 
neighborhood,  for  then  the  entries  of  those  who  are  to  play  in  the 
other  event  can  generally  be  secured. 

Application  should  be  made  to  the  national  governing  body  for 
official  sanction  for  the  tournament,  stating  dates  and  other  particu- 


262  SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

lars.     If  any  championship  events  are  to  be  on  the  programme,  official 
recognition  must  be  applied  for  before  these  titles  can  be  of  any  value. 

A  printed  circular  should  be  issued  by  the  tournament  committee, 
which  should  state  plainly — (1)  the  name  of  the  clut*  and  the  loca- 
tion of  the  courts  ;  (2)  the  date  of  the  meeting  and  the  hours  of  play  ; 
(3)  the  list  of  events,  and  the  championship  titles  (if  any)  to  be 
competed  for,  with  the  prizes  offered  for  each  event;  (4)  the  amount 
of  the  entrance  fees,  and  place  and  date  for  closing  the  list  of  entries  ; 
(5)  the  name  of  referee,  handicapper  and  tournament  committee;  and 
<6)   the  time  and  place  of  the  draw. 

The  draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  committee  in  public  and 
due  notice  of  the  time  and  place  be  given  to  the  competitors,  so  that 
they  may  be  present  or  represented  when  the  draw  is  made.  The 
draw  should  always  be  made  by  the  Bagnall-Wilde  system.  (See 
^'Tournament    Regulations.") 

No  money  or  its  equivalent  in  any  form  should  be  offered  as  prizes, 
for  this  would  disqualify  the  players  from  future  competition  as  ama- 
teurs. Prizes  should  be  silver,  gold,  cut  glass,  objects  of  art  or  other 
souvenirs  of  this  kind  that  can  be  marked  or  engraved  as  trophies. 
It  is  preferable  to  have  them  marked  before  the  tournament,  although 
Jawn  tennis  prizes  are  frequently  bought  with  the  privilege  of  ex- 
change, and  therefore  not  engraved  until  after  the  tournament. 

The  committee  should  select  a  referee,  either  from  among  their  num- 
ber or  outside  of  it.  If  handicaps  are  to  be  held,  the  referee  may 
also  be  the  handicapper,  or  a  sub-committee  may  be  appointed  for  this 
purpose.  Should  the  referee  be  also  a  competitor,  a  substitute  should 
also  be  appointed  to  act  for  him  while  he  is  playing. 

It  is  important  to  have  enough  balls,  and  only  the  best  quality  of 
tournament  balls  should  be  used  for  matches.  It  is  the  custom  at  most 
tournaments  to  allow  three  new  balls  with  each  match,  but  in  play- 
ing on  dirt  courts,  the  same  balls  can  sometimes  be  made  to  do  service 
twice.  Unless  there  are  back-stops  close  behind  the  courts,  it  is  also 
well  to  have  some  small  boys  handy  to  act  as  ball-boys  and  "shack" 
the  balls  for  the  players. 

The  lines  of  a  tournament  court  should  be  marked  out  fresh  every 
day  and  if  easily  obliterated,  also  between  matches  on  the  same  day. 
The  courts  should  always  be  laid  north  and  south  so  that  one  player 
will  not  get  more  than  his  share  of  the  glaring  sunlight  in  his  eyes. 
There  should  never  be  a  tree  within  shadow  distance  of  a  tournament 
court  either,  particularly  on  the  south   side  of  the  court. 

Facilities  must  be  provided  for  the  players  to  dress,  and  it  is  a 
good  plan  to  appoint  one  member  of  the  committee  to  attend  to  these 
accommodations,  and  to  entertain  the  visiting  players  and  see  that 
their  wants  are  attended  to. 

The  draw  should  always  be  posted  in  a  conspicuous  place  on  the 
.grounds,  where  the  spectators  as  well  as  the  players  can  inspect  it. 
If  possible  a  programme  for  each  day's  play  should  be  made  out  in 
advance,  and  due  notice  of  all  the  matches  of  the  day  be  posted  up  by 
the  draw  each  day.  The  courts  should  be  numbered,  and  a  certain  ' 
court  and  hour  set  for  each  match.  One  member  of  the  committee 
ought  also  to  be  assigned  to  getting  umpires  for  the  matches  and 
seeing  that  they   are  properly  started.  •' 

It  is  customary  to  exhibit  the  prizes  for  a  tournament  at  the  clul? 
grounds  during  the  tournament,  and  it  generally  proves  an  attractive"^  , 
feature  to  have  them  displayed  on  a  table  on  the  grounds,  all  duly  ■' 
labeled  so  that  spectators  can  see  which  events  they  are  to  be  given 
for.  A  refreshment  tent  is  also  an  attractive  feature  at  a  tourna- 
ment and  the  prizes  are  then  displayed  under  this  tent  on  the  same 
or  a  nearby  table  with  the  punchbowl.  Lemonade,  or  tea,  crackers, 
( akes  and  sometimes  small  sandwiches  are  generally  served  to  the 
players   and  spectators  under  such  refreshment  tent. 


SPALDING'S    LAWN     TENNIS    ANNUAL.  263" 

How  to  Build  and  Keep  a  Court 

Nothing  is  more  important  for  the  full  enjoyment  of  lawn  tennis; 
than  a  satisfactory  court,  and  none  of  the  other  accessories  of  the 
game  offers  a  wider  variety.  Many  important  considerations  come  up- 
even  after  the  kind  of  court  to  be  built,  and  the  cost,  have  been  de- 
cided upon.  No  matter  hov/  much  is  to  be  spent  on  the  ground,  nor 
what  the  surface  is  to  be.  the  most  important  things  to  consider  first 
are  space,  light  and  drainage. 

The  back-stop  nettings  should  never  be  nearer  than  fifteen  feet  to- 
the  lines,  and  if  good  players  are  expected  to  use  the  court,  particu- 
larly if  tournament  matches  are  to  take  place  on  it.  the  space  behind 
the  base-line  should  be  21  feet  at  each  end.  At  the  sides  at  least 
6  feet,  if  possible  12  feet  should  be  allowed  beyond  the  side-lines  for 
doubles  of  each  court.  A  well-appointed  court  for  tournament  play 
should  be  centered  in  an  unobstructed  space  of  not  less  than  60x120 
feet.  Wire  baclr-stop  netting  10  or  12  feet  high  should  surround  it 
at  these  distances  from  the  lines.  If  there  are  two  or  more  courts 
together,  there  should  be  at  least  12  feet  between  their  side  lines,  and 
one   netting  can  surround   all. 

In  selecting  a  site  for  a  court,  a  spot  should  be  chosen  where  there 
is  always  plenty  of  sunlight,  and  where  at  no  time  of  the  day  does 
any  shadow  cross  the  ground  on  which  the  court  is  to  be  .'aid.  Green, 
or  black  is  a  pieferable  background  to  play  against,  but  any  dark  and. 
even  color  will  do.  A  court  should  never  be  laid  out  with  any  very 
light  background  within  a  short  distance  at  either  end.  or  close  at 
either  side.  Nor  should  a  site  be  selected  with  a  badly  mixed  or 
moving  background.  Shade  trees  are  useful  near  a  court,  only  if  their 
shadow  is  a  solid  one,  not  constantly  checkered  by  flecks  of  sunlight, 
glittering  through  moving  branches,  which  constantly  confuse  the 
players.  Never  should  they  be  allowed  near  enough  to  cast  any 
shadows  on  the  playing  surface. 

One  more  cardinal  point  should  be  remembered.  The  court  should 
invariably  be  laid  out  north  and  south — never  east  and  west.  If  this 
warning  is  disregarded,  the  player  at  one  end  or  the  other  will  be  hope- 
lessly blinded  by  the  sun. 

Tlie  question  of  drainage  is  one  of  the  most  important  considerations- 
in  selecting  a  site  of  this  kind.  On  the  natural  facilities  depends- 
largely  the  cost  of  laying  out  a  good  court.  If  the  natural  soil  be 
sandy  and  well  drained,  or  if  it  is  on  higli  ground  which  slopes  away 
near  by,  artificial  drain  i)i])es  will  not  have  to  be  put  in.  and  this' 
saves  much  of  the  cost,  but  if  it  be  thick  clay  that  holds  moisture  long, 
or  on  low  ground  with  neighboring  slopes  that  drain  toward  it.  the 
court  will  be  useless  for  many  hours  after  each  rainfall  unless  artificial 
drain-pipes  are  put  in.  i 

After  the  site  has  been  selected,  it  must  be  decided  whether  a  grass 
or  "dirt"  court  is  to  be  built.  If  the  natural  sod  is  luxuriant  and  the 
soil  favorable  for  its  growth,  or  if  the  court  is  not  to  be  used  enough: 
to  wear  off  the  grass,  a  turf  court  will  generally  be  found  preferable, 
but  if  the  ground  is  to  be  constantly  in  use.  the  sod  will  wear  off  and" 
become  "bald"  unless  there  is  space  enough  on  the  lawn  to  shift  the 
court  frequently. 

When  good  turf  cannot  be  had  or  will  not  stand  the  wear,  a  substi- 
tute must  be  found,  and  sand  or  dirt  courts  are  most  often  used. 
On  well-drained  land,  one  can  sometimes  cut  away  the  top  surface, 
level  the  eround  and  roll  it  until  well  hardened  and  the  court  is  ready 
for  use.  but  more  preparation  is  necessary  to  build  a  permanent  court 
that  will  not  be  constantly  losing  its  proper  level. 

For  such  a  court  the  earth  should  be  cut  away  to  a  depth  of  on-* 
foot  if  no  drains  are  required.     After  leveling  it  carefully  with  a  spirit- 


264  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

level,  to  be  sure  that  the  grade  is  light,  a  layer  of  six  inches  of  broken 
fetone  should  first  be  laid  and  pounded  down  hard.  Ordinary  trap-rock 
used  for  macadamizing  roads  is  perhaps  the  best  for  this  purpose,  but 
any  broken  stone,  ranging  in  sizes  from  a  walnut  to  an  e^g,  will  answer 
the  purpose.  This  should  be  covered  with  a  three-inch  layer  of  coarse 
gravel  or  fine  broken  sLone,  which  should  be  thoroughly  pounded  and 
watered  for  several  days  before  being  covered.  Before  any  surface  Is 
put  on  ti:e  court,  the  greatest  care  should  be  taken  to  see  that  the 
foundation  is  perfectly  level.  Any  holes  or  depressions  that  appear 
from  rolling  and  pounding  should  be  filled  in  before  it  is  covered. 

Every  v/cll  built  court  should  be  graded  either  from  end  to  end  or 
from  side  to  side  to  an  extent  of  not  over  two  inches,  which  will 
suffice  to  drain  off  rain  water.  If  artificial  drainage  is  necessary  to 
keep  the  court  dry,  drain  pipes  can  be  laid  in  the  foundations  of  the 
•court  about  three  feet  outside  the  side  and  end  lines,  care  being 
taken  whereby  the  pipes  will  tilt,  following  the  grade  of  th--  court  as 
far  as  possible,  thus  allowing  the  water  to  run  off.  The  best  drain 
pipes  are  sis-inch  stone  sewer  pipe,  cut  in  halves,  or  stone  gutters 
used  on  tiled  roofs,  which  should  be  sunk  in  the  ground  immediately 
under  the  foundation  of  broken  rock  and  filled  with  pebbles  or  fine 
■cracked  stone. 

The  covering  for  a  gravel  or  sand  court  should  bo  not  less  than 
three  nor  more  than  six  inches  in  thickness,  and  of  sandy  loam  and 
•clay  mixed.  The  proportions  depend  on  the  quality  of  the  clay.  If  it 
is  very  binding  and  sticky,  one  part  of  sand  to  four  of  clay  are  pref- 
erable, but  for  the  average  ingredients  they  should  be  mixed  about 
eight  parts  of  clay  to  one  part  of  sand.  When  the  court  is  finished,  if 
it  is  found  to  be  too  soft  but  dry,  more  clay  should  be  added  ;  while  if 
it  drains  poorly  and  stays  muddy  to  long  after  rain,  or  its  surface  is 
too  sticky  for  the  player's  feet,  more  sand  should  be  added  on  the 
surface.  When  a  court  is  finally  covered,  it  should  be  thoroughly 
•watered  and  rolled  alternately  twice  every  day  for  two  weeks  before  it 
is  played  on  at  all,  and  any  depressions  or  ilneven  spots  corrected  aa 
fast  as  they  appear  from  the  settling.  After  the  first  heavy  rain 
storm  it  should  be  gone  over  and  releveled  most  carefully,  for  then 
it  is  most  likely  to  develop  new  faults. 

The  fine  seashore  sand  will  seldom  be  found  satisfactory  for  the 
surface  of  a  court,  for  it  works  loose  too  quickly  under  the  players' 
feet,  and  can  only  be  made  to  bind  when  mixed  with  a  larger  propor- 
tion of  clay,  which  will  make  the  drainage  more  difficult,  as  water 
percolates  very  slowly  through  clay.  If  the  soil  upon  which  a  court 
is  being  built  is  very  rich  and  worms  promise  to  work  through  to  the 
surface  above  and  injure  the  court,  it  is  well  to  lay  a  layer  of  fine 
cinders,  those  from  a  railroad  engine  preferred,  between  the  foundation 
and  the  sandy  surface  layer.  These  cinders  effectually  prevent  worms 
from  coming  through  to"  the  surface.  It  is  also  we'll  to  use  coarse 
sifted  ashes  mixed  with  the  stones  in  the  drain-pipes. 

The  construction  of  a  grass  court  is  less  difficult,  but  varies  much 
more  in  process.  If  cost  need  not  be  considered,  it  should  be  built 
by  an  expert,  and  will  be  laid  on  deep-laid  foundations:  if  it  is 
desired  to  build  an  economical  court  on  an  available  lawn  which  is 
fairly  level,  the  cost  will  not  be  heavy.  The  sod  should  first  be  care- 
fully removed  in  squares  of  about  eighteen  inches,  from  a  space  at  least 
50  by  100  feet,  "cutting  down  to  a  depth  of  about  six  inches.  The 
ground  should  then  be  turned  with  a  spade  to  a  depth  of  eighteen 
Inches  or  two  feet,  and  after  all  stones  have  been  removed,  and  the 
«arth  carefully  raked  over  and  leveled,  it  should  be  packed  and  rolled 
with  a  heavy  roller.  It  cannot  have  too  'much  leveling  and  rolling, 
■and  the  rolling  should  be  kept  up  for  several  days  with  plenty  of 
soaking  by   rain  or  hose-pj.pe.     Any   inequalities   which   th©  heavy  pres- 


SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL.  265 

«ure  of  the  roller  produces  should  be  filled  in  or  cut  down  before  the 
sods  are  relaid. 

After  the  ground  has  been  rolled  sufficiently  the  sods  should  be 
replaced.  In  doing  this  it  is  important  to  get  the  edges  close  together, 
so  that  no  seams  or  open  cracks  can  be  found.  These  soda  should  be 
relaid  in  the  afternoon  and  well  drenched  with  water.  The  next  day 
the  ground  should  be  rolled  again  :  and  this  should  be  followed  by 
alternate  drenching  and  rolling  for  several  days.  Even  when  the 
ground  finally  appears  firm  and  level,  the  court  should  not  be  played 
upon  until  new  blades  of  grass  appear  in  considerable  numbers.  If 
depressions  appear,  the  sod  at  that  spot  should  be  lifted,  fresh  earth 
inserted  to  the  proper  grade  and  the  sod  replaced,  watered  and  rolled 
till  level  and  flat  again. 

Bad  spots  are  often  found  where  the  grass  is  thin  or  where  malignant 
weeds  obstruct  its  growth,  and  in  this  case  fresh  sods  should  be 
bought  or  cut  elsewhere  and  substituted.  Sometimes  large  patches  of 
gronnd  must  be  renewed  in  this  way,  but  it  will  be  found  much  less 
expensive  if  all  the  turf  is  bad  to  sow  the  new  court  down  with  lawn 
seeds,  and  seeds  will  often  help  out  thin  spots  in  the  grass  if  the 
•court  is  not  to  be  used  too  soon  after  the  sowing.  It  is  better  to  make 
a  grass  court  in  the  fall  whether  it  is  to  be  sown  with  seed  or  sodded. 
The  winter  storms  will  then  settle  it  thoroughly,  and  after  a  little 
releveling  in  the  spring  it  will  be  ready  for  use. 

Grass  seeds  should  be  sown  between  the  middle  of  March  and  the 
first  of  May,  or  better  yet,  in  the  autumn,  between  the  middle  of 
August  and  the  first  of  October.  It  takes  about  20  pecks  of  good 
lawn  seed  to  cover  a  space  60  by  120  feet.  The  sowing  should  be 
gone  over  twice,  tlie  second  time  at  right  angles  to  the  first.  Clover 
seeds  should  be  avoided,  as  this  grass  does  not  wear  well,  and  euano 
should  not  be  used  for  fertilizing,  for  it  tends  to  bring  up  coarse  blades 
in  patches. 

As  soon  as  the  young  grass  is  high  enough  to  be  topped,  a  scythe  or 
sickle  should  be  used,  being  at  first  better  than  the  mowing  machine. 
After  the  new  gra.ss  is  well  hardened,  however,  the  latter  should  be 
constantly  in  use.  never  less  than  once  a  week,  and  in  moist  warm 
jveather  nearly  every  day.  With  every  precaution  weeds  are  sure  to 
appear,  but  these  can  generally  be  held  in  check  by  constant  mowing. 
The  more  formidable  weeds,  however,  must  be  cut  with  a  knife  one  by 
one  about  an  inch  below  the  surface,  and  care  being  taken  to  remove 
as  much  of  the  root  as  possible.  'A  pinch  of  salt  dropped  on  the  cut 
root  will  generally  stop  the  growth.  When  the  turf  becomes  worn  in 
spots  a  small  shift  in  the  lines  of  the  court  will  relieve  the  pressure 
and  enable  the  grass  'to  grow  again  ;  at  the  end  of  the  season  all  of 
the  bare  patches  should  be  resown. 

There  are  several  other  kinds  of  courts  sometimes  built  when  turf 
<?annot  be  had.  Cinders,  clay,  concrete,  cement  and  asphalt  are  also 
sometimes  used,  while  board  courts  are  built  undercover  for  winter  use. 

Concrete  and  cement  are  open  to  many  objections.  They  are  very 
hard  on  the  eyes  and  legs,  and  often  make  the  player's  feet  sore  ;  the 
surface  generally  wears  out  the  balls  and  shoes  quickly,  and  it  is  also 
liable  to  crack  with  frost.  Cinder  courts  are  cheap  and  easy  to  con- 
struct, but  the  surface  is  so  gritty  that  it  burns  the  feet  of  the  players 
and  soon  uses  up  the  balls.  They  are  also  very  dirty.  Asphalt  courts 
are  expensive  and  much  affected  by  heat  and  cold,  sometimes  even 
•cracking  with  the  frost. 

In  Australia  courts  have  been  made  of  cracked  blue-stone,  while  a 
cheaper  substitute  has  been  found  in  England  in  what  is  called  a  brick 
rubble   court. 

Once  the  court  is  finally  built  and  ready  for  use,  it  must  be  properly 
marked  out.      In  every  case,  unless   it  be  of  grass,  and  the   lines  are 


266  SPALDING'S    LAWN    TENNIS    ANNUAL. 

to  be  constantly  shifted  to  prevent  bare  spots,  net-posts  should  be 
permanently  sunk  in  the  ground.  They  should  be  not  less  than  two 
feet  under  the  ground  nor  forty  feet  apart. 

A  good  dirt  court  should  be  swept,  watered,  rolled  and  freshly 
marked  out  after  every  eight  or  ten  sets  of  play,  and  oftener  in  very 
dry  weather.  Instantly  a  depression  is  discovered  it  should  be  filled 
in  and  rolled  down  before  playing  is  continued,  for  it  is  almost  as 
dangerous  for  the  players  as  the  court  to  continue  with  it  uneven. 
A  court  should  never  be  rolled  in  the  condition  the  players  leave  it 
after  play.  A  player's  heel  raises  a  little  lump  :  if  the  roller  goes  over 
this  before  it  is  swept  down  even  again,  a  hard  ridge  results  and  the 
ball  will  bound  unevenly  from  it.  It  should  be  swept  over  first,  until 
all  the  lumps  are  leveled  down,  before  the  roller  is  allowed  on  its 
surface. 

One  of  the  best  sweepers  is  made  of  a  heavy  joist  of  wood  with  a 
dozen  thicknesses  of  old  jute  bagging  or  coarse  cloth  frayed  out  at  the 
bottom  edges,  fastened  to  its  bottom  and  trailing  on  behind  it.  This 
should  be  drawn  over  the  court  with  a  handle  or  rope  several  times. 
If  it  is  pushed,  the  groundsman's  feet  will  leave  tracks  after  it ;  if  he 
goes  ahead  the  sweeper  will  erase  them.  Before  the  lines  are  marked 
out  fresh,  the  old  ones  should  always  be  swept  off  with  a  broom,  but 
if  the  broom  is  constantly  used  along  the  lines  in  a  parallel  direction, 
it  will  gradually  wear  away  little  grooves  in  the  court  where  the  lines 
are  and  the  balls  will  bound  improperly  from  them.  T'he  sweeping 
should  be  done  lightly  across  the  court,  at  right  angles  with  the 
lines, 

A  grass  court  cannot  have  too  much  care.  It  is  advisable  to  wet  it 
thoroughly  several  times  a  week  and  roll  it  as  often.  It  should  oe 
watered  at  night,  cut  in  the  morning,  and  rolled  after  cutting  and 
before  watering.  The  best  way  to  repair  a  bare  strip  of  ground  is  to 
lay  fresh  turf,  and  this  should  be  done  in  the  fall  or  as  early  as  pos- 
sible in  the  spring.  Good  tough  turf,  laid  in  February  or  early  in 
March,  will  be  fit  for  use  by  the  first  of  June.  In  the  early  spring 
grass  roots  both  in  new  turf  and  old  may  be  greatly  benefited  by  a 
good  dressing  of  manure  well  worked  in,  but  regular  manuring  should 
also  be  done  in  the  fall. 

Worm  casts  are  very  bad  for  good  tennis  turf.  Particularly  m 
fertile  ground  or  after  a  storm,  the  little  mounds  will  appear  on  the 
sod,  and  if  the  roller  passes  over  them  or  they  are  trodden  down  little 
hard  lumps  are  formed  which  spoil  the  surface  of  the  court.  The  turf 
should  always  be  swept  before  rolling,  and  in  rich  soil  every  morning. 
This  scatters  the  mounds  effectually.  Where  it  is  necessary  to  get 
rid  of  the  worms,  lime  water  should  be  sprinkled  on  the  ground.  They 
will  then  come  to  the  surface  and  can  be  swept  away. 

When  a  horse  mowing  machine  is  used  it  is  well  to  have  the  horse's 
hoofs  covered  with  soft  pads  to  prevent  their  cutting  into  the  turf 
and  leaving  prints  that  affect  the  bound  of  the  ball.  The  groundsman 
at  work  on  good  lawn  tennis  courts,  particularly  when  the  turf  is 
soft,  and  always  on  a  sand  court,  should  be  required  to  wear  rubber- 
soled  shoes  witlaout  heels.

How  to  Lay  Out  a  Tennis  Court 


As  a  double  court  practically  includes  every  line  to  be  found  in  a 
single  court,  it  is  best  to  take  first  the  measure  for  the  latter.  Hav- 
ing determined  the  position  of  your  net,  plant  in  the  ground,  in  the 
line  chosen,  two  pegs,  27  feet  apart  (at  the  points  A  and  B  in  the 
I  diagram).  Then  take  two  measures  and  attach  their  respective  ends 
to  the  pegs  A  and  B:  On  the  first,  which  will  measure  the  diagonal 
of  the  court,  take  a  length  of  47  feet  5  inches ;  on  the  other  39  feet ; 
pull  both  taut  in  such  directions  that  at  these  distances  they  meet 
in  a  point  C.  This  v>^ill  give  one  corner  of  the  court.  At  that  point  F^ 
21  feet  from  B,  put  in  a  peg  to  mark  the  end  of  the  service-line.  The 
other  corner,  D,  and  the  other  end  of  the  service-line  G,  may  be 
found  by  interchanging  the  measures  and  repeating  the  process.  The 
same  measurements  on  the  other  side  of  the  net  will  complete  the 
exterior  boundaries  of  the  court.  By  prolonging  the  base-line  4  feet 
6  inches  in  each  direction,  and  joining  the  four  new  points  thus 
obtained,  we  can  make  the  side-lines  of  a  double  court.  It  only 
remains  to  mark  the  central  line.  This  is  done  by  joining  the  middle 
points  of  the  service-lines.  If  a  double  court  alone  be  required,  the 
interior  side-lines  need  not  be  prolonged  to  meet  the  base-lines. 
Remember  that  in  all  cases  the  net-posts  must  stand  at  a  distance 
of  three   feet  from   the   side-lines.

Spalding'  Hand  Made  Tenms  Nets 

We  recommend  most  strongly  our  hand  made  nets.     Quality  of  material  and  workmanship  is  absolutely  the  best. 

uid  they  are  well  worth   many  times  the  additional  cost  over  the  ordinairjr  machine   made  styles  on  account  of 

their  greater  durabiUty.    If  posts  are  placed  just  42  or  36  feet  apart,  net  will  fit  exactly  when  allowed  to  hang 

on  the  tightly  drawn  top  rope.

SFALDING  LAWN  TENNIS  POSTS 


Tesasans  Posts 

This  style  post  is  in  use  on  the  courts  of 
the  most  prominent  clubs  in  this  country. 

The  uprights  are  of  heavy  2- inch 
japanned  steel  tubing,  pointed  at  lower 
end  so  as  to  go  24  inches  into  ground 
and  equipped  with  wheel  at  top.  Ratchet 
for  tightening  net  has  a  particularly  strong 
leverage  Iron  hooks  and  cleats  fo^ 
fastening  ropes. 

By  means  of  triple  claw  clutches, 
made  of  heavy  wrought  iron,  there  can 
be  no  shifting  or  shaking  once  posts  are 
placed  in  position,  and  the  tighter  the  net 
is  drawn  the  more  rigid  the  posts  become. 
No.  A^    Per  pair. 


"A^to=I<;Oc'"'  Teiams  Posts 

We  recommend  these  posts  especially  for  private  courts 
or  wherever  it  is  desirable  to  remove  posts  immediately 
after  play  is  finished.  The  "Auto-Loc"  tightenmg  ratchet 
is  a  patented  device;  which  permits  the  closest  adjustment 
in  oghtening  and  regulating  the  height  of  the  net,  and 
locks  automatically  and  inBfently  as  soon  as  released.
