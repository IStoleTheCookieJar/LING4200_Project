CALENDARS 


Calendar  of  the  United  States  House  of  Representatives  and 

History  of  Legislation.  GPO.  J47.A3 

Official  source  of  business  reported  from  committees. 
Published  daily  when  House  is  in  session.  Reports  on  pending 
legislation  in  both  Senate  and  House.  Monday  issues  include 
subject  index  to  all  legislation.  Final  issue  provides 
summary  of  action,  list  of  public  law  numbers,  and  list  of 
bills  that  did  not  become  law.

Senate  Calendar  of  Business .  GPO . 

Because  the  House  calendar  provides  information  on 
legislation  for  both  the  Senate  and  the  House,  this  is  not  a 
freguently  used  publication.  It  is  further  hindered  by  having 
no  index  and  is  not  cumulative.  Published  daily  when  Senate 
is  in  session.

Committee  calendars.  House  &  Senate.  GPO. 

In  general  these  calendars  are  a  record  of  all  committee 
business.  Information  recorded  usually  includes:  members  of 
the  committee  and  subcommittees,  legislation  referred, 
legislative  action  taken,  hearings  held  (and  printed) ,  and 
publications  issued.  Because  each  calendar  is  controlled  by 
its  respective  committee,  they  vary  as  to  content  arrangement 
and  frequency  of  publication.  Issues  cumulate  with  the 
final  issue  covering  an  entire  Congress.

DEBATES  &  PROCEEDINGS 


Debates 


Congressional  Record.  GPO. 

The  Record  is  the  fourth  in  a  series  of  publications 
reporting  congressional  debates.  They  are  as  follows: 

a.  Annals  of  Congress  1789-1824 

b.  Register  of  Debates  1824-1837 

c.  Congressional  Globe  1833-1873 

d.  Congressional  Record  1873- 

Since  its  inauguration  the  Record  has  gone  through  several 
revisions  of  content  and  arrangement.  It  now  consists  of  four 
sections:  the  proceedings  of  the  House;  the  proceedings  of  the 
Senate;  the  Extension  of  Remarks;  and  the  Daily  Digest,  each 
paged  and  numbered  separately.  Since  March,  1978  inserted 
items  (those  not  "spoken"  on  the  floor)  are  designated  by  a 
"bullet". 


Current  coverage  of  Congress  is  provided  by  the  daily 
Congressional  Record.  The  daily  Record  is  superseded  by  the 
bound  Congressional  Record.  However,  because  the  bound  set 
is  an  edited  version  of  the  daily,  one  index  does  not  serve 
both.  The  index  for  the  bound  set  is  a  separate  volume  while

Departments 

The  departments  of  the  executive  branch  issue  many 
publications.  Some  of  these  are  required  by,  and  submitted  to, 
Congress  (eg.  annual  reports) .  Once  submitted  they  become 
congressional  documents.  As  such  they  follow  the  same  process  of 
other  congressional  reports  and  documents  that  eventually  become 
part  of  the  Serial  Set.  For  further  description  of  the  Serial  Set 
and  its  location  see  p.

This  series  began  as  an  annual  in  1957  and  is  very 
limited  in  its  retrospective  coverage.  At  present  the 
complete  set  includes  the  papers  of  Hoover  and  Truman  through 
Carter.  Presidential  papers  (that  exist)  prior  to  Hoover  and 
those  of  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt  were  issued  by  private 
publishers.  The  Public  Papers  are  basically  an  edited  version 
of  the  Weekly  compilation  of  Presidential  Documents. 
Beginning  with  Carter,  all  information  published  in  the  Weekly 
Compilation  will  now  be  reprinted  in  the  Public  Papers.

5.  Proclamations  &  Executive  Orders 

It  is  not  always  easy  to  distinguish  between  the  use  of 
these  two.  Customarily,  proclamations  are  used  for  action 
that  has  no  legal  effect;  yet  some  have  the  force  of  law,  some 
do  not.  Executive  orders  are  used  to  direct  and  govern 
government  officials  and  agencies.  Proclamations  and 
Executive  orders,  however,  are  treated  as  distinct  items  with 
each  issued  in  separate  numerical  order.

opinions  become  preliminary  prints  (also  known  as  advance
