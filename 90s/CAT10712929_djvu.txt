Vaccination is one of several health management 
practices available to feedlot operators to decrease 
risk of disease impacting animal performance in the 
feedlot. Vaccination can be viewed as part of an 
overall health management program that includes, 
among other factors: nutrition, handling, facilities, 
and pre-arrival management. 


In the fall of 1994, the USDA’s National Animal 
Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) contacted 
producers with feedlots of less than 1,000 head 
capacity by telephone and visited producers with 
larger feedlots from the 13 primary cattle feeding 
states. The cattle inventory in the 13 states was 
approximately 85 percent of the national inventory as 
of January 1, 1994, and the 13 states fed in excess of 
85 percent of the total cattle fed for harvest in the 
United States. Large-capacity operations comprised 4 
percent of feedlots, but accounted for 83.3 percent of 
total feedlot inventory for the 13 states as of January 
1, 1994. During the Cattle on Feed Evaluation 
(COFE), 913 small-capacity and 453 large-capacity 
feedlot producers responded to interview questions

Respiratory Pathogens 
in U.S. Feedlots 


National Animal Health Monitoring System 








about operation management and health of their 
animals. Results were weighted to represent all small 
and large feedlots from the 13 states. 


Producers were asked about vaccination practices 
for cattle placed on feed in their operation over a 
period from July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994. 


Vaccination practices for respiratory pathogens 
while in the feedlot varied by feedlot size and region 
(Table 1). Less than one-half of smaller feedlots (less 
than 1,000 head, one-time capacity) vaccinated for 
each respiratory pathogen. Nearly all (95-100 per- 
cent) of larger feedlots vaccinated cattle for infectious 
bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR). Most large feedlots (75 
to 89 percent) also vaccinated for other viral causes of 
respiratory disease in cattle. Vaccination for bacterial 
causes of respiratory disease (Pasteurella spp. and 
Hemophilus somnus) were used much less frequently 
than viral antigens in all sizes of feedlots. 


Table 1 shows vaccination for respiratory 
pathogens was used by less than 50 percent of

feedlots in all regions with the exception of the 
south central United States. This result was 
likely due to the predominance of larger feedlots 
in the south central region compared to other 
regions. 


The percentage of cattle placed on feed that 
were vaccinated for viral causes of respiratory 
disease by feedlot size showed similar trends as 
with the percent of feedlots vaccinating (Table 2 
and Figure 1). On a regional basis, the percen- 
tage of cattle vaccinated for respiratory pathogens 
was, in general, higher than the percentage of 
operations vaccinating because larger feedlots 
placed more cattle on feed and were more likely 
to vaccinate. In the midwest, a higher proportion 
of the cattle placed were placed in smaller 
feedlots, and thus, the smaller percentage of 
animals vaccinated for respiratory viruses in that 
region compared to the others.

In summary, vaccination for viral pathogens of the 
respiratory system was common, especially among 
larger feedlots. However, for most regions and 
feedlot sizes, less than one-half of cattle placed 
were vaccinated for bacterial respiratory 
pathogens.

Injection site lesions continue to be of great 
concern to the beef industry. On-going surveys of 
top sirloin butts would indicate that progress has been 
made in eliminating lesions from this cut of meat 
(Figure 1). Feedlot operators have responded 
significantly to the message of quality assurance in 
beef production, particularly with respect to 
injection practices. 


The USDA’s National Animal Health Monitoring 
System (NAHMS) collected management 
information from feedlots with at least 1,000 head, 
one-time capacity in the 13 primary cattle feeding 
states. Over 85 percent of the January 1, 1994, 
inventory of cattle on feed for the United States were 
present in these 13 states. Though these 
large-capacity feedlots represented only 4 percent of 
all feedlots in the 13 states, they had 83.3 percent of 
the 13 states’ January 1994 feedlot inventory. In 
October, November, and December of 1994, 453 
feedlot operators provided information on health 
management practices for NAHMS’ Cattle on Feed 
Evaluation (COFE). The results were weighted to 
represent all large (1,000 head or more capacity) 
feedlots in the 13 states. 


Previous COFE information from feedlots in the 
same area showed that 83.1 percent of these 
large-capacity feedlots had changed their injection 
practices (location or route) in the past 5 years due to 
concems about quality assurance or food safety. 
However, there is still room for improvement as the 
National Cattlemen’s Association study of top sirloin 
butts would indicate. 


Much concern about injection site lesions has 
centered around the use of clostridial vaccines, 
especially multivalent products. Most large feedlots 
(91.0 percent) vaccinated some cattle with a 
clostridial vaccine. Of all of the placements in large

feedlots between July 1, 1993, and June 30, 1994, 
92.0 percent were reported to have received at least 
one clostridial vaccination. Just over 23 percent of 
the cattle placed on operations using clostridial 
vaccines received more than one clostridial 
injection. Multiple vaccinations (at the same time or 
at different times) may lead to more injection site 
lesions. Table 1 shows the primary clostndial 
organisms vaccinated against included Cl. perfringens 
type C and D (90.8 percent of cattle placed),

Producers were asked about the route and location 
of clostridial injections. Only 13.8 percent of large 
feedlots that gave some clostridial vaccines did so in 
the muscle. For operations that used the intramus- 
cular route for clostridial vaccination, 72.7 percent 
indicated that all intramuscular injections were given 
in the neck. Another 18.4 percent of operations 
indicated that all of their intramuscular clostridial 
vaccinations were given in the upper rear leg 
(Figure 2). Other sites were used much less 
frequently. 


Other injectables that have been a concern to the 
industry as a potential source of lesions are some 
antibiotics and vitamins. Producers reported that 16.1 
percent of the cattle placed on feed in large feedlots 
received one or more regular antibiotic injections 
(label specified effect was 24 hours or less) for 
prevention or treatment purposes, and 13.1 percent 
received long-lasting antibiotic injections (label 
specified effect was greater than 24 hours). 


Most large feedlots (84.3 percent) that gave regular 
antibiotics indicated that some of the regular 
antibiotics were given intramuscularly. For oper- 
ations using the intramuscular route, 12.8 percent 
indicated that all intramuscular injections were given 
in the upper rear leg. Over one-half (51.3 percent) 
indicated that all intramuscular injections were given 
in the neck. Many feedlots (62.8 percent) reported 
that some long-acting antibiotics were given in the 
muscle. Of those injecting in the muscle, 12.6 
percent indicated all were given in the upper leg. 
Over one-half (57.9 percent) indicated all 
intramuscular injections were given in the neck. 


Fifty-eight percent of large producers reported use 
of any vitamin injections. Overall, 44.3 percent of the 
cattle placed on feed received some sort of vitamin 
injection while they were on feed. The most 
commonly used vitamin injection was a combination 
of vitamins: A, D, and E (46.1 percent of operations 
and 42.5 percent of all cattle placed.) 


Over three-fourths (76.8 percent) of large feedlots 
giving vitamin injections gave some intramuscularly. 
Among the operations using the intramuscular route, 


16.2 percent gave all intramuscular vitamin injections 
in the upper rear leg. 


In summary, most operators of large feedlots have 
altered their injection practices in response to concern 
about beef quality. Still, there are a number of 
producers using products in ways that may lead to 
injection lesions. To some extent, this behavior is 
due to label clearances for specific products. 
However, the pharmaceutical and biologics industry 
is responding to the call for more products to be 
cleared for subcutaneous use and to document the 
lack of injection blemishes when used according to 
label indications. Together, beef producers and 
professionals allied to the beef industry can and will 
make progress in further improving beef quality.

Feedlot operators rely heavily on key individuals 
for the information they need to support decisions on 
animal health management, nutritional management, 
and general production. One of the prominent 
figures recognized as a source of information is 
the veterinarian. 


The USDA’s National Animal Health Monitoring 
System (NAHMS) collected management 
information from feedlots with at least 1,000 head 
one-time capacity in the 13 pnmary cattle feeding 
states). Over 85 percent of the January 1, 1994, 
inventory of cattle on feed for the U.S. were present 
in these 13 states. Though these large-capacity 
feedlots represented only 4 percent of all feedlots in 
these areas, they had 83.3 percent of the 13 states’ 
January 1994 feedlot inventory. In October, 
November, and December of 1994, 453 feedlot 
operators provided information on health 
management practices for NAHMS’ Cattle on Feed 
Evaluation (COFE). Analyses of these data 
incorporated the selection criteria and, thus, the 
results pertained to all large (1,000 head or more 
capacity) feedlots in the 13 states. 


Producers were asked to rate the importance of 
various sources of information. Figure 1 shows that, 
in the area of animal health information, the 
veterinarian was most commonly cited as being very 
or extremely important (91.4 percent of producers.) 
Other highly important sources of animal health 
information were nutritionists (71.9 percent), animal 
health salespersons (37.8 percent), and other 
producers (32.3 percent). 


Regarding sources of nutritional information, the 
nutritionist was the most commonly cited source as

being highly important (92.1 percent, Figure 2). 
Other sources less frequently cited as being highly 
important were veterinarians (41.2 percent) and feed 
salespersons (40.6 percent).

Figure 3 shows that producers indicated a greater 
reliance on nutritionists (71.7 percent) as a highly 
important source of general production information 
than other sources such as the veterinarian (60.0 
percent) and other producers (40.7 percent). 


In summary, the veterinarian is a well respected 
source for animal health information. But, over 
two-thirds of operators of large feedlots had similar 
esteem for the nutritionist as a source of animal health 
information. Producers value veterinarians, but rely 
on them to a lesser extent for their nutritional 
information. 


Over 20 percent of feedlot operators indicated that 
the veterinarian is not important as a source of 
nutrition information. Some would say that the 
veterinarian should be a more highly regarded source 
of information in the nutrition area, particularly since 
animal health and nutrition are integrally related. 
Perhaps lack of skills (perceived or real) in the area of 
nutrition is responsible for lack of reliance on the 
veterinarian for nutritional information. 


While the veterinarian is a key player in the 
operation of large feedlots, opportunities exist for 
them to expand their influences. They could 
enhance services to feedlots through development of 
additional skills in nutrition and general production 
and by marketing those skills to feedlot operators so

that they are seen as an important source of 
information in areas other than animal health. In 
addition, the value placed on nutritionists as a source 
of information to feedlots underscores the need for 
veterinarians to develop alliances with these 
individuals to attain optimal herd health and feedlot 
profitability.
