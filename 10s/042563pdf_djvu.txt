Who  is  Tampering  with  the  Soul  of  America ? 


The  Hi-Y 
Club 

The  Hi-Y  Club  is  the  Y.M.C.A. 
in  the  high  schools  of  America, 
a fellowship  of  boys  committed 
to  a Christian  purpose.  The  pur- 
pose of  the  Hi-Y  is  to  create, 
maintain,  and  extend  throughout 
the  home,  school,  and  community 
standards  of  Christian  character. 
The  platform  of  the  Hi-Y  is  Clean 
Speech.  Clean  Sportsmanship. 
Clean  Scholarship,  and  Clean  Liv- 
ing. 

The  Hl-Y  Club  attempts  to  de- 
velop personal  Integrity  and  self- 
discipline  among  its  members. 
Another  objective  is  to  perform 
useful  home,  church,  school,  and 
community  services.  The  Hl-Y 
tries  to  develop  an  active  grow- 
ing relationship  and  responsibility 
to  the  Christian  church  and  to 
create  a sense  of  personal  worth 
based  on  Christian  values  and 
concepts.  One  of  the  great  objec- 
tives of  the  Hl-Y  is  increased  co- 
operation with  other  groups  of 
young  people  in  order  to  achieve 
worthwhile  goals. 

The  main  purpose  of  the  Hi-Y 
is  service.  This  club  at  M.B.A. 
this  year,  under  the  leadership  of 
Jim  Duniel  and  under  the  sponsor- 
ship of  Park  Gilmore,  has  tried 
to  achieve  this  purpose.  With 
Frank  Smithson  as  vice-president; 
Ben  Gamblll,  secretary;  and 
Tommy  Corcoran,  chaplain,  this 
year's  Hl-Y  has  accomplished 
more  than  any  other  Hl-Y  Club 
in  MBA’s  history.  The  Hl-Y 
had  charge  of  the  concession 
stand  at  the  Onion  Bowl  this  fall 
when  the  Gray-Y  League  played 
its  football  games  Every  Satur- 
day for  seven  weeks  the  boys  of 
M.B.A.  Hl-Y  sold  refreshments  at 
these  games.  From  these  weekly 
sales  and  from  two  dances  spon- 
sored by  the  Hl-Y,  the  clubs 
treasury  has  been  greatly  en- 
riched. At  Christmas  several  Hl-Y 
Club  members  went  to  the  Sunny - 
side  Rest  Home  to  help  bring  the 
Christmas  spirit  to  the  old  people. 
The  boys  bought  refreshments  and 
sang  Christmas  carols  to  cheer  the 
shut-ins  at  Yule-Time.  The  ma- 
jor undertaking  this  year  is  an 
Easter  Egg  Hunt.  About  forty 
children  from  the  61st  Avenue 
Mission  will  bo  treated  to  an 
Easter  Egg  Hunt  by  the  boys  from 
the  M.BA.  Hi-Y.  The  children, 
ranging  in  age  from  six  to  nine 
years,  will  be  picked  up  by  the 
Hi-Y  members  and  taken  to 
MBA.  where  they  will  be  treated 
to  this  egg  hunt,  complete  with 
the  Easter  Rabbit  and  prizes  for 
the  child  who  has  found  the  most 
eggs. 

Perhaps  the  old  M.B.A.  fight 
song,  sung  at  so  many  athletic 
events  (We’re  the  boys  . . .)  is 
now  growing  obsolete.  Maybe 
through  the  Hl-Y  Club  and  its 
services  to  others,  the  M.BA.  boys 
are  being  taught  to  care  for  some- 
one besides  themselves. 


Special 

Exercise 

Squad 

(McGugin’s  Guerillas) 

The  value  of  this  year's  Special 
Exercise  Squad  may  be  shown  by 
the  timely  comment  of  the  late 
Mr.  Bjornstjerne  (Max)  Bjorason, 
or  someone  who  looked  an  awful 
lot  (and  that’s  pretty  awful)  like 
Mr.  Bjdmson,  who  said; 

“For  the  lack  of  a horse,  the 
battle  was  lost; 

For  the  loss  of  a battle,  the  war 
was  lost; 

For  the  loss  of  the  war.  my 
shoes  were  lost.” 

or  something  that  sounded  an  aw- 
ful lot  like  that. 

On  November  2ft.  1062.  this 
year's  Special  "X"  Squad  was 
bom.  For  approximately  two  and 
one-half  months,  it  looked  as 
though  Mr.  Scott  (Hit-'em-a-tick) 
Trundle  might  last  the  entire  sea- 
son but,  after  a group  of  people 
composed  of  six  influential  doc- 
tors, 157  Influential  students,  and 
three  mediocre  fox  terriers  ad- 
vised him  to  go  away  and  get 
some  rest,  he  . . . well,  he  went 
away  and  got  some  rest. 

Mr.  George  (Just-caU-me- 
George)  McGugin  took  over  the 
coaching  reins  after  Mr.  Trundle’s 
departure.  George  has  made  many 
friends  and  several  enemies. 

The  list  of  boys  participating  in 
this  program  reads  like  a list  of 
“Who’s  Who?”  in  the  annals  of 
Montgomery  Bell  Academy  social, 
academic,  and  athletic  life.  Such 
standouts  as  “Cruncher”  Meach- 
eam,  “Brtng-on- the- women”  Wil- 
liams, “Plkes-Pcak-or-Bust”  Mul- 
ligan. and  “BlIly-the-Kidd"  Bram- 
ham,  also  known  as  “I’m  Dyna- 
mite" or  “Let's-move-baby;  1’m- 
Bill”  Bramham,  are  but  a few 
that  participate.  Because  of  the 
lack  of  sufficient  space,  the  rest 
of  the  squad  must  remain  anony- 
mous. They  may  feel  assured, 
however,  that  our  hearts  are  with 
them.  Every  day,  from  3:30  until 
twenty  minutes  of  four,  these 
valiant  souls  toil,  receiving  none 
of  the  plaudits  to  which  the  Bas- 
ketball. Rifle,  Wrestling,  and  Cut- 
the-Pie  Teams  are  so  accustomed. 

Well,  as  the  Corsicans  say:  “La 
lionne  s’est  41anc'ee  sur  sa  victime 
mais  le  vent  s’ileve  pen  h pen  et 
ie  ne  puis  m'  empecher  de  rire.” 
(That  is  to  say:  “The  lioness 
leaped  forth  upon  Its  victim  but 
the  wind  is  gradually  rising  and 
I cannot  keep  from  laughing.” 
There's  not  mud)  I can  add  to  that 
except  my  wholehearted  thanks 
and  commendations  to  McGugin’s 
Guerillas.  Thanks  and  . . . er 

. . commendations.

Merit 

Scholarship 

Finalists 

On  February  16,  six  M.B.A.  sen- 
iors were  announced  as  Merit 
Scholarship  Finalists  for  1063. 
These  seniors  are  Jim  Daniel 
Johnny  Glover,  Ronnie  Jackson, 
David  Nicholas,  Bobby  Sholars, 
and  Frank  Smithson.  These  boys 
were  Merit  Semiflnalists  and  qual- 
ified as  Finalists  by  their  Decem- 
ber College  Board  scores  and  their 
high  school  records.  The  Merit 
Corporation  states  that  85%  of 
all  Semifinalists  qualify  bs  Final- 
ists. In  the  spring,  the  recipients 
of  the  Merit  Scholarships  will  be 
announced. 


The  Service  Club 

The  Service  Club  is  a new  or- 
ganization at  M.B.A.  this  year. 
The  charter  members  of  the  Serv- 
ice Club  arc  the  boys  who  were 
members  of  the  now  disbanded 
Key  Club.  New  members  of  the 
Service  Club  are  chosen  for  their 
leadership,  outstanding  character, 
and  scholastic  ranking  in  the  up- 
per half  of  their  class. 

Mr.  Gentry  is  the  faculty  spon- 
sor for  the  Service  Club,  and 
Tommy  Corcoran  is  the  president. 
Jimmy  Uden  is  the  vice-president; 
Bobby  Porter,  the  secretary;  and 
Allen  Lentz,  the  treasurer. 

The  purpose  of  the  Service  Club 
is  to  provide  service  to  the  school 
and  to  the  community.  Earlier 
this  year,  the  Service  Club  spon- 
sored a highly  successful  dance 
after  a football  game.  The  main 
function  this  winter  has  been  the 
collection  of  admissions  for  the 
home  basketball  games.  The  Serv- 
ice Club  also  sponsored  a drive  in 
the  school  to  collect  canned  goods 
for  needy  families.  This  drive 
was  very  successful  and  the  con- 
tributions of  canned  goods  en- 
abled four  needy  families  to  have 
an  enjoyable  Christmas. 

In  the  future,  the  Service  Club 
plans  to  undertake  several  proj- 
ects for  the  school.  Plans  include 
the  painting  of  the  furnace  build- 
ing outside  Wallace  Hall  and 
cleaning  and  reorganizing  the  at- 
tic of  the  BaU  Building. 

The  Service  Club,  being  an  ex- 
clusive organization,  is  naturally 
limited  in  membership.  The  mem- 
bers of  the  Service  Club  are  proud 
that  they  are  members;  their  will- 
ingness to  aid  the  school  in  every 
way  possible  reflects  this  pride. 
The  future  of  the  Service  Club 
is  bright,  mainly  because  of  the 
high  calibre  of  the  members  of 
the  organization.  Stressing  lead- 
ership, outstanding  character,  and 
high  scholastic  ranking,  the  Serv- 
ice Club  is  a most  valuable  orga- 
nization to  the  school.

The 

Forensic 

Club 

"In  order  to  promote  skill  In 
public  speaking  and  reading,  and 
to  develop  a more  general  Interest 
in  these  accomplishments  through- 
out the  student  body  of  this  high 
school,  this  organization  is  estab- 
lished." 

Thus  reads  the  Preamble  of  the 
constitution  of  the  Forensic  Club 
Of  MBA.  In  these  few  words  is 
formed  the  guiding  purpose  for 
the  organisation  of  the  MBA  for- 
ensic club. 

The  Forensic  Club,  under  the 
direction  of  Mrs.  Campbell,  was 
founded  in  1950.  At  that  time  it 
was  decided  that  the  club  would 
consist  of  juniors  and  seniors; 
however,  membership  has  now 
been  extended  to  include  sopho- 
mores who  have  completed  their 
freshman  speech  course. 

The  officers  for  1962-A3.  elected 
at  the  last  official  meeting  in  April 
of  last  year  are:  president.  Johnny 
Glover;  vice-president,  Ricki  Rick- 
etson; secretary,  Mike  Mooty;  and 
program  chairman,  Lee  McKnight. 

The  forensic  club  sponsors 
many  projects  throughout  the 
school  year.  Club  members  pre- 
sent assembly  programs  on  Mon- 
day and  Tuesday  of  each  week. 
The  Freshman-Sophomore,  Junior- 
Senior  declamation  contests  held 
each  Fall  are  among  the  larger  of 
the  forensic  club  undertakings. 

A banquet  is  held  in  December 
of  each  year  with  some  outstand- 
ing citizens  of  die  community  as 
guest  speakers.  In  years  past 
such  fine  young  men  as  George 
Cate  Jr.,  State  Senator  Robert 
Taylor,  and  Senator  Tom  Shriver 
have  spoken  to  us. 

Members  of  the  debate  team, 
an  activity  of  the  Forensic  Club, 
travel  to  Emory  University  in  At- 
lanta each  year,  in  order  to  com- 
pete with  54  other  schools  from 

The  Forensic  Club  in  the  spring 
will  sponsor  a forensic  contest 
among  other  schools  of  the  NIL. 
This  Is  the  first  undertaking  of 
this  sort  for  the  club. 

It  is  obvious,  therefore,  that  the 
forensic  club  is  one  of  the  most 
active  organizations  on  campus. 
The  fact  that  there  are  some  50 
members  this  year  indicates  that 
the  club  is  living  up  to  its  origi- 
nal purpose,  to  promote  interest 
in  forensic  activities  among  MBA 
students.

Freshman  News 

Dear  Readers. 

Again  we  of  the  Freshman  News 
are  here.  M B A.  now  holds  the 
record  for  the  only  school  to  be 
open  during  the  week  of  January 
23.  The  students  took  exams  and 
the  students  flunked  the  same  ex- 
ams. We  members  of  the  Fresh- 
man Class  would  like  to  thank 
Mr.  Carter  for  keeping  the  stu- 
dent body  on  schedule. 

Some  notable  quotes  from  our 
notable  (?)  classmates: 

Bradley— “C’mon  Coach  Smith,  I 
have  to  go  to  rifle  practice.” 

Mr.  Pafford— "No  Majors,  don’t 
eat  it!  Throw  it  away!" 

Mr.  Gilmore — “Oh,  the  eye,  well 
he  was  a big  guy,  well  he  was 
about  . . ” 

Mr.  Carter— “Hold  if  my  sleigh 
is  overparked.” 


Mr.  Kirkpatrick— “No  Pritchett, 
the  malmsey  butt  not  the  balmsey 
mutt” 

The  Freshman  basketball  team 
wound  up  the  year  with  only  three 
wins  and  numerous  losses.  It  is 
not  such  a spectacular  record  but 
the  players  played  the  game  well. 
Frosh  standouts  were  David  Hy- 
att Jim  Burge.  Dent  Shillinglaw. 
Mike  Howard,  Greer  Cummings 
as  well  as  the  rest  of  the  team. 
The  team  got  over  the  shakes 
after  the  first  of  the  year  and 
came  close  to  winning  until  the 
fourth  quarter  came  around.  The 
Frosh  beat  Cohn  twice  and  suc- 
ceeded in  beating  a powerful 
Franklin  ball  club.  The  main 
problem  with  the  Little  Red  was 
that  they  had  really  no  height. 
The  tallest  man  on  the  team  was 
only  5‘9*  and  against  buys  who 
were  six  feet  and  taller  this  is 
not  much  in  the  way  of  controlling 
the  boards 

On  the  other  hand  the  Fresh- 
man wrestling  team  got  to  wrestle 
this  year  against  some  very  able 
competitors  of  the  so-called  "B" 
team  of  the  Freshman  basketball 
team.  Though  thoroughly  out- 
weighed by  Sharp,  the  wrestlers 
used  their  numbers  to  overpower 
the  giant.  Coach  Smith  was  ec- 
static about  handing  out  demerits. 
The  wrestling  team  did  have  one 
bright  spot;  Winston  Evans  ad- 
vanced to  the  varsity  by  breaking 
the  first  string  wrestler's  wrist  and 
defeating  the  116  lbs.  class  wres- 
tler Winston  showed  his  superior 
skill  by  pinning  his  man  in  the 
meet  against  Father  Ryan. 

Exams  are  gone  in  the  past 
never  to  be  mentioned  again,  we 
hope  Grades  are  kept  silent  and 
the  enthusiasm  of  the  Freshman 
Class  is  at  an  all  time  low.  Some 
of  the  Freshmen  fared  well  while 
others  happened  to  get  below  the 
75  mark. 

FLASHES— 

Appfel  passes  Senior  Math  but 
flunks  Freshman  Algebra. 

Sharp  Is  reported  to  be  in  fine 
shape  after  a run-in  with  the 
wrestlers 

Letters  have  been  pouring  in  for 
more  pictures  of  Bradley  and  the 
rifle  team.  Bradley  admiU  that 
he  was  shot  by  his  comrades. 

Biology  members  try  to  inact 
the  age  old  tradition  of  cutting 
down  the  cherry  tree  but  the  ef- 
for  was  curtailed  by  Mr  Pafford. 

Duncan  swears  that  eating  frog 
livers  that  have  been  In  a poison 
are  delicious.  The  fad  is  not 
catching  on. 

After  much  detailed  thought, 
Davidson  decides  that  since  he 
cannot  pass  the  work  at  MBA 
he  will  join  the  Musicians'  Union 
where  he  is  promised  a job 

This  might  be  the  last  paper  of 
the  year  because  the  Freshman 
News  writers  have  decided,  with 
the  persuasion  ($)  of,  to  join  the 
paper  strike  In  New  York! 

Bye  now  .

Letters  to  the  Editors 

Dear  Editor: 

What  can  I do?  My  situation 
is  desperate.  I cannot  find  a 
girl  anywhere.  Please  advise. 

P.  P. 

Dear  P.  P.: 

Get  yourself  a guitar  and  play 
in  a combo.  It  never  falls. 
Now.  the  sophomore  class  would 
like  to  present  a street  question- 
naire: The  question  of  this  month 
is,  “What  is  your  opinion  of  nu- 
merical trigonometry?" 

Jay  Branura — "I  don’t  know,  but 
I messed  up  homework  yester- 
day.” 

Round  Paul  Callis — “It’s  square.” 
Shull  Morrison — “I’d  tell  you  if 


1 wasn’t  such  a punk.” 

Pat  Patrick — “Ugh!” 

Ed  Anderson — "I  agree  with 
Lee’s  conception  of  a triangle 
(square).” 

Chip  Baker  (by  way  of  Paul  Sex- 
ton)—’^ ! »@ac!" 

Matt  (the  bat)  Horner  is  produc- 
ing a new  T.V.  series  called 
"Mr.  Baker  Goes  to  Washing- 
ton” or  “Chip  Becomes  a Page." 
We  wish  to  make  a public  serv- 
ice announcement — The  Sa  turns' 
Combo  is  now  The  New  Sa  turns 
featuring  Wynn  Dixon  on  the 
baritone  sax  and  Peyton  Hogue, 
vocalist.  This  is  quite  an  addi- 
tion to  the  Nashville  music  scene, 
which  is  the  home  of  the  Opry. 

Several  sophomores  are  plan- 
ning spring  vacations.  Paul  Cal- 
lis is  going  to  Florida  with  his 
harem.  Ed  Anderson  must  get  to 
Fort  Lauderdale  In  order  to  be 
with  guess  who.  Lee  Noel  prob- 
ably will  go  to  the  Gold  Coast. 

John  Williams  wishes  to  make 
an  announcement  of  which  he  Is 
boastful — He  beat  Rick  Evans  on 
a chemistry  test  by  2 points. 

T.  Howell  and  Shanks  have 
published  their  official  motto — 
“Has  ac  fls." 

Pat  Patrick,  well-known  gui- 
tarist and  vocalist,  has  published 
a Shakespearean  sonnet,  which 
has  wide  acclaim  (2  people). 

We  want  to  mention  the  severe 
illness  of  Lee  Noel,  who  is  now 
well.  It  was  caused  by  fear  of 
Bill  Boner 

Fisher  De  Zevolos  now  has  an 
added  attraction  to  his  blonde 
hair:  Square-cut,  hum-rimmed  bi- 
focals, which  in  his  words  are — 
“Not  ‘peepers.'  but  creepers  ' " 


Junior  Class  Times 

Juniors  Begin  Look  at  College 

In  the  past  several  months,  the 
Junior  Class  has  become  more 
aware  of  the  pressures  of  getting 
Into  college.  Until  now,  college 
has  seemed  a vague  and  nebulous 
ides;  now,  however,  it  is  sud- 
denly found  that  college  days  are 
soon  to  come  Perhaps  chiefly 
responsible  for  this  realization 
are  the  College  Board  Examina- 
tions and  the  Scholastic  Aptitude 
Tests.  Now  we  must  begin  to 
make  the  choices  and  decisions 
that  will  have  great  Impact  upon 
our  future  lives,  and  these  tests 
make  the  approach  of  these  de- 
cisions more  obvious.  Whether  we 
enter  the  college  of  our  choice  or 
not.  whether  we  do  what  we  want 
or  not  as  far  as  an  education  goes 
is  largely  dependent  upon  how 
well  we  do  In  these  last  two  years 
of  high  school.  We  must  look 
forward,  and  do  our  best  on  all 
of  the  testa  and  In  all  of  our 
classes.  In  this  way  lies  our  goal. 

The  Kulture  Kornrr 
"The  Raven  One” 

Once  upon  a school  day  dreary, 
While  I studied  weak  and  weary, 
Over  many  a quaint  and  curious. 
Textbook  of  imponderable  lore; 
Suddenly  there  came  a rapping. 
Loud  and  violently  Upping. 

For  my  teacher  caught  me  nap- 
ping. 

Napping  on  the  classroom  floor! 

I remember,  quite  contrary. 

It  was  in  bleak  February. 

That  my  teacher  caught  me  nap- 
plng. 

Napping  on  the  classroom  floor. 
And  she  told  me,  “Nevermore!” 
“Never,  ever,  let  me  catch  you. 
Napping  on  my  classroom  floor!” 
The  only  answer  was  a snore.

Word  Game 

This  week’s  word  is  Poston, 
which  means  “teacher  of  English.”

Have  you  ever  wondered  about 
the  names  of  people?  Why  they're 
the  way  they  are?  Well,  it’s  be- 
cause of  an  ancestor.  Let’s  use  a 
few  examples: 

To  start  off  with  an  easy  one — 
BiU  Berry’s  long  forgotten  ances- 
tor wag  obviously  a grave-digger; 
hence,  from  bury  to  Berry. 

One  of  Frederick  Billings’  an- 
cestors was  a deadbeat,  because 
he  never  paid  his  bills. 

A jingoist  in  Jimmy  Lowen- 
thal’s  family  gave  all  he  had  to 
the  great  hero  Lowenth. 

Mike  Mooty  comes  from  a long 
line  of  debaters;  all  pondering 
moot  points. 

Willis  Gabitas’s  folks  must  have 
been  great  talkers;  thus  the  gab. 

A ditch-digger  in  Webb  and 
Bobby  Harwell’s  past  named  Har- 
struck  water;  thus  Har’s  well. 

Doug  Beauchamp’s  progenitors 
were  boxers — and  really  beauti- 
ful champs!

can  tell  where  you  might  have 
come  from!

BASKETBALL 

On  the  Friday  night  following 
exam  week,  an  exhausted  Big  Red 
basketball  team  took  the  court  In 
West’s  small  and  inadequate  gym. 
Managing  to  get  only  one  player 
in  double  figures,  Ben  Gambill 
with  22,  the  Maroons  fell  55-46. 
In  the  next  three  games,  the  Big 
Red  lost  two  games  to  Howard 
by  three  points  each  (47-44  : 44- 
41)  and  one  to  Lipscomb  by  two 
(65-63).  In  each  of  these  games, 
the  team  was  led  by  lanky  Lloyd 
McAdams,  who  managed  48  points 
in  these  games.  The  following 
two  games  saw  the  Maroons  get 
two  straight  victories,  one  an  easy 
54-39  win  over  TPS  and  the  other 
a hard-fought  32-30  win  over 
Hume  Fogg.  This  winning  streak 
was  the  longest  of  the  regular 
season  games.  On  Friday.  Feb. 
15,  an  inspired  Big  Red  team  took 
on  a tall  sharpshooting  East  team 
which  was  seeking  a share  of  the 
NIL  Championship.  Playing  a 
good  game,  the  team  was  defeated 
because  of  unnecessary  fouls  and 
floor  mistakes;  as  was  the  case 
against  Lipscomb  and  Ryan  in  the 
following  two  games.  As  the  reg- 
ular season  came  to  a close  against 
Ryan,  the  Big  Red  showed  much 
promise  of  pulling  many  upsets 
In  the  District  and  Regional  tour- 
naments. 

In  the  District  tournaments,  the 
Big  Red  won  its  first  game,  de- 
feating Cohn  by  a score  of  49-39. 
MBA  met  Howard  in  the  second 
game  and  was  defeated. 


Freshman 

Basketball 

The  Freshman  basketball  team 
began  Its  season  with  a 45-31  loss 
at  the  hands  of  Ryan,  after  a 
comeback  in  the  second  half  led 
by  Jim  Burge  and  David  Hyatt. 
In  the  next  game,  at  East,  after 
scoring  3 points  the  first  half,  the 
Red  Team  could  not  conquer  East 
and  fell  48-21.  At  Hillsboro  the 
Freshmen  lost  again,  48-25,  On 
a trip  to  B.GA.,  the  Red  received 
its  worst  defeat,  66-20  (one  of 
our  players  tossed  in  2 points  for 
them).  Then,  at  Franklin,  the 
Freshmen  lost  a close  one,  45-40, 
led  by  Jim  Burge  with  14  and 
David  Hyatt  with  10;  Franklin 
scored  18  In  the  second  quarter  to 
our  6.  The  Rod  Team’s  first  vic- 
tory was  at  Cohn,  when  Mike 
Howard  made  2 free  throws  with 
5 seconds  remaining.  The  Fresh- 
men won  the  game  42-40  and 
showed  a marvelous  effort  by 
coming  from  6 points  behind  with 
2 minutes  left.  In  the  first  home 
game  of  the  season,  after  7 away, 
the  Red  lost  to  Ryan  once  again 
by  a 45-22  margin.  Then,  once 
more  at  home,  the  Freshmen,  led 
by  Hyatt  with  It.  lost  to  BO  A 
in  the  final  quarter,  33-26.  Hills- 
boro defeated  the  Red  Team,  this 
time  at  home,  by  46-30.  The 
Freshmen  then  traveled  to  Bailey, 
where  they  lost  in  a close  game 
44-38;  David  Hyatt  and  Woody 
Husband  had  10  apiece,  but  a 
player  from  Bailey  tossed  in  20. 
Traveling  to  Clarksville,  the 
Freshmen,  led  by  Hyatt  with  12 
and  Husband  with  11,  lost  another 
squeaker,  to  Greenwood.  40-36. 
Then,  at  home  once  more,  the  Red 
beat  Franklin  33-27.  David  Hyatt 
had  18  points,  the  highest  scored 
in  one  game  by  an  M.B.A.  fresh- 
man this  year.  M.B.A.  beat  Cohn 
again,  this  time  at  home,  in  an- 
other squeaker,  40-39.  Hyatt 
tossed  in  2 free  throws  to  enable 
the  Red  to  win;  Burge  got  in  12 
and  Shillinglaw  10.  East  beat  the 
Red  Team  by  a score  of  42-30; 
the  game  was  decided  in  the  final 
quarter.  In  the  final  game  of  the 
season,  Greenwood  of  Clarksville 
trounced  the  Freshmen,  46-28. 

High  scorer  for  the  season  was 
David  Hyatt  with  120  points.  Then 
came  Burge  with  85,  Cummings 
with  55,  Howard  with  42,  Husband 
with  40,  and  Shillinglaw  with  31. 
The  team  was  ably  coached  by 
Mr.  Gilmore  and  managed  by  Alex 
Nicholson  and  David  Eyler.  The 
team  began  slowly  but  became 
much  better  toward  the  end  of  the 
season;  their  overall  record  was 
3-12.

News 

The  Junior  Varsity  did  ex- 
tremely well  for  the  1962-63  sea- 
son, scoring  788  points  to  the  op- 
ponents 710.  With  a 13  and  7 
win-lost  record,  the  team  went 
into  the  18th  district  B-team 
tournament  seeded  number  1. 
Beating  Peabody  41-34  and  Hume 
Fogg  49-37,  MBA  met  Ryan  In 
the  finals.  Ryan's  defense  was 
too  strong  for  the  Red  as  shown 
by  the  44-22  defeat  MBA  received. 

Many  things  happened  during 
the  regular  season.  The  JV  lost 
guards  Hunter  Husband  and  Lee 
Noel  and  forward  Bob  Llgon  to 
the  varsity  and  obtained  guard 
Jimmy  Lowcnthal.  These  changes 
occurred  the  week  of  exams  be- 
fore the  West  game  Shull  Morri- 
son and  Rhea  Sumpter  left  be- 
cause of  scholastic  work.  John 
Fort  left  to  enter  the  work  of 
wrestling.  A newcomer  to  the 
school,  Roger  Dlsilvestro,  joined 
the  everchanging  JV  for  the  game 
with  Lipscomb. 

Guard  Pat  Woods  was  the  high 
scorer  for  the  entire  season, 
closely  followed  by  center  Ed  An- 
derson. Pat  went  into  the  tourna- 
ment with  118  points,  scored  38 
points  in  three  games,  and  wound 
up  the  season  with  156  points. 
Pat  also  set  high  scoring  marks  in 
two  gomes.  In  the  second  game 
with  West  Pat  scored  24  points 
and  later,  in  the  tournament  game 
with  Hume  Fogg,  scored  25. 

With  the  loss  of  Husband.  Noel, 
and  Ligon  and  Sumpter  the  first 
string  was  changed.  This  team 
consisted  of  high  scoring  guard 
Pat  Woods,  hustling  guard  Andy 
Harris,  consistent  center  Ed  An- 
derson, forwards  Tom  Weaver  and 
Joel  Parrish.  Composing  the  rest 
of  the  team  was  Bill  Oeny,  Tom 
Bally,  John  Shapiro,  Paul  Wells, 
Jimmy  Lowenthal,  Norman  Carl, 
Bill  Olson,  and  Roger  DiSilvestro. 

The  JV  started  the  season  with 
a 36  to  18  win  over  Cohn.  Then, 
having  last  to  Ryan  43-31  and  to 
West  53-33,  MBA  came  back  to 
overwhelm  BGA  50-43.  With  wins 
over  TPS  (47-29).  Peabody  (43- 
23),  North  (44-21),  Peabody  again 
(25-22),  Cohn  (32-29),  and  Hills- 
boro (44-32),  Franklin  sneaked 
past  the  JV  with  a 35-33  win  and 
the  following  Monday  Clarksville 
outscored  MBA  51-43.  For  the 
last  game  before  exams  the  Red 
knocked  off  BGA  53-41. 

For  the  first  game  after  the  ex- 
ams MBA  met  and  lost  to  West, 
59-48,  having  lost  Noel,  Husband 
and  Ligon.  MBA  came  back  with 
wins  over  Howard  (33-29),  Lips- 
comb (32-30),  Howard  again  (41- 
36).  TPS  (49-29)  and  finished  the 
season  with  defeats  from  Hume

PERSONALITIES 


It  Is  Indeed  an  honor  to  an- 
nounce that  Mr.  Robert  Gentry 
has  been  named  as  Teacher  of 
the  Month.  Mr.  Gentry  came  to 
M.B.A.  last  year  from  Sowanee 
Military  Academy  where  for  six 
years  he  taught  mathematics, 
coached  football,  and  was  Direc- 
tor of  Admissions.  He  also  taught 
at  Franklin  High  School  where  he 
taught  mathematics,  and  coached 
football,  basketball,  and  baseball. 

Mr.  Gentry  has  always  lived  in 
Middle  Tennessee.  He  attended 
Battle  Ground  Academy  and  Pea- 
body College.  A firm  believer  in 
clean  country  living,  he  lives  on 
his  twenty  acre  farm  with  his 
wife  and  two  children.  He  raises 
angus  cattle. 

Since  he  has  come  to  M.B.A., 
Mr,  Gentry  has  taught  every  high 
school  math  course.  He  coaches 
varsity  football,  and  he  works  with 
the  freshman  intramural  basket- 
ball team.  He  is  also  the  faculty 
advisor  of  the  Service  Club.  It  is 
thus  a pleasure  to  have  Mr.  Gen- 
try os  Teacher  of  the  Month

Wrestling 

The  matmen  are  continuing  to 
show  Improvement  since  their  sec- 
ond beating  at  the  hands  of  Bat- 
tle Ground.  They  were  beaten 
badly  by  the  School  for  the  Blind 
Just  after  their  return  from 
Christmas  vacation.  The  only  two 
to  win  for  the  "Big  Red"  were 
Frederic  Billings  and  Jim  Ezell, 
both  by  decisions.  Paul  Sloan, 
the  captain,  obtained  a draw.  The 
score  of  this  match  left  MBA  with 
8 points  and  the  TSB  with  the 
remainder.  As  the  season  prog- 
ressed the  team  took  a trip  to 
Sewunee  and  wrestled  both  Saint 
Andrews  and  SMA.  The  score  of 
this  St.  Andrews  match  was  29-22 
in  favor  of  St.  Andrews.  The 
score  at  SMA  was  23-20,  also  in 
favor  of  the  opponent. 

MBA,  nearing  the  end  of  the 
season,  had  not  won  a match.  On 
the  15th  of  February  St.  Andrews 
wrestling  team  showed  up  unex- 
pectedly and  were  not  able  to 
wrestle  because  of  a basketball 
game.  However,  the  next  morn- 
ing, the  much  improved  wrestlers, 
under  the  able  but  terribly  un- 
organized coaching  of  Holt  Smith, 
beat  the  cocky  BGA  squad  25-23. 
The  results  were: 

95  lb. — D.  Elam  obtained  a de- 
cision 

103  lb. — Harwell  was  pinned

TENNIS 

TEAM 

This  year’s  tennis  team,  having 
last  year,  by  a brash  David  Lips- 
comb team,  been  thrown  oft  the 

N. I.L.  tennis  pedestal  for  the  first 
time  in  17  years,  is  back  again  but 
this  time  favored  to  regain  the  ti- 
tle. 

A transfer  and  an  ineligibility 
weakened  this  year's  squad,  but 
Lipscomb's  team  suffered  severe 
graduation  losses  and  there  ap- 
pears no  immediate  threat  to  an 

M. B.A.  renewal  of  supremacy. 
Steady  Frank  Bass  leads  this 

year’s  pack  but  Johnny  Glover, 
Johnny  Reed,  Greer  Cummings. 
Dent  Shillinglaw,  Buzz  Beau- 
champ, Don  Crichton,  and  Steve 
Trautman  will  all  be  contesting 
for  the  following  ranks. 

This  year’s  team,  as  has  been 
the  case  for  almost  twenty  years, 
will  be  coached  by  Mr  James  C. 
Rule,  known  widely  for  both  his 
tennis  knowledge  and  his  off-court 
witticisms. 

Last  year,  although  beaten  in  the 

N. LL.,  the  Big  Red  still  managed 
to  tie  for  the  TSSAA  champion- 
ship. 

Furthermore,  all  members  of 
this  year’s  team  performed  well  in 
the  local  tournaments  last  sum- 
mer, a feat  which  gives  all  the 
more  reason  to  expect  a fine  year 
for  the  M BA  tennis  team.

Under  the  Stands 

Many  complaints  have  been 
flowing  in  over  the  past  few 
weeks  concerning  the  vicious  ar- 
ticle written  about  Steve  Traut- 
man. We  would  simply  like  to 
remind  our  avid  readers  that  the 
cuts  in  the  column  are  written 
entirely  In  Jest.  No  harm  was 
intended  for  our  popular  and  per- 
sonable Steve  “Star  " Neverthe- 
less. it  is  to  be  said  that  if  Zckc 
continues  his  massive  body-build- 
ing. weight-gaining  program,  the 
Dominion  Toothpick  Company 
will  no  longer  use  Steve  as  the 
model  for  their  ’63  styles. 

Our  congratulations  go  out  this 
issue  to  Billy  Gourley,  who  played 
almost  three  minutes  in  a basket- 
ball game  and  did  not  faint  or  cry 
even  once;  to  Lloyd  MacAdams 
who  held  his  man  scoreless  until 
the  opening  tip-off;  and  to  Jim 
Daniel,  who  fouled  out  of  a bas- 
ketball game  with  less  than  two 
minutes  left  in  the  2nd  quarter. 

Also  in  line  for  recognition  is 
bur  beloved  Frank  Smithson. 
Frank,  now  known  as  one  of 
MBA's  more  studious  and  hard- 
working students,  has  taken  a vi- 
tal interest  in  sports;  Frank,  one 
of  MBA's  up  and  coming  young 
wrestlers,  has  almost  won  several 
matches  in  inter-squad  meets 
against  such  mat-titans  as  Duke 
Elam  and  Bill  Fanning.  Now 
Frank  is  agitating  for  a swimming 
team  at  MBA.

Ah 


Cruelty! 

In  nn  endeavor  to  secure  the  at- 
tention of  a recent  assembly  pro- 
gram, Mr.  Tony  Edmonds,  noted 
historian  and  jovial,  popular  mem- 
ber of  the  M.B.A.  faculty,  per- 
pertrated  an  inocuous  hoax  upon 
the  student  body.  It  seems  that 
Mr.  Edmonds,  always  fertile  of 
Imagination,  announced  a holiday, 
only  to  confess,  after  the  mem- 
bers of  the  student  body  had 
pummelled  one  another  about  and 
broken  several  desks  In  their  glee, 
that  he  was  only  "April  fooling." 

A white  Olds  was  devastated, 
only  one  tire  surviving.  A tree 
on  campus  began  to  sprout  strange 
and  exotic  foliage.  Seniors  were 
to  be  seen  chortling  to  themselves. 
Even  Dr.  Sager  and  Mr.  Rule  ex- 
changed guffaws. 

As  so  often  happens,  an  inno- 
cent bystander  was  made  to  suffer. 
Beeler  Brush,  who  had  no  part  In 
the  crime,  was  made  to  recon- 
struct the  car.  while  Mr.  Edmonds 
threatened  with  a cat  'o  nine-tails. 
Mr.  Edmond's  despotism  has  re- 
sulted in  u gross  miscarriage  of 
justice.  Retribution,  anyone?

APRIL  FOOL!! 


The  Establishment  of  Montgomery  Bell  Academy 

Montgomery  Bell  Academy  was  originally  started  in  1808  as  the  preparatory  department  of  the  old 
University  of  Nashville.  The  school  started  under  the  conducl  of  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  University 
of  Nashville,  and  today  its  operation  by  a board  still  operating  under  the  title  of  the  "Board  of  Trustees 
of  the  University  of  Nashville." 


In  1855  the  Western  Military  Institute  was  merged  with  the  preparatory  school  which  continued  to 
operate  as  a department  of  the  University  of  Nashville.  The  school  continued  under  this  direction  until 
the  opening  of  the  Civil  War.  and  for  the  six  years  from  1881  through  1888  iU  activities  were  dominant. 
However,  in  1887  the  Board  of  Trustees  met  and  decided  to  accept  the  legacy  of  the  Honorable  Montgomery 
Bell,  a Nashville  Industrialist  and  banker,  who  in  1852  left  a trust  fund  for  the  education  of  worthy  boys. 
This  trust  fund  provided  for  the  education  of  twenty-five  worthy  boys  free  of  charge,  and  also  stipulated 
that  the  school  to  be  established  for  this  purpose  must  be  called  “Montgomery  Bell  Academy.”  The  Trus- 
tees of  the  University  of  Nashville  accepted  his  legacy  and  established  Montgomery  Bell  Academy  as  a 
separate  school  and  department  of  the  University  of  Nashville.  From  September.  1887.  to  date,  the  school 
has  been  operated  as  provided  In  the  will  of  the  Honorable  Montgomery  Bell,  and  under  the  direction  of 
the  said  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  University  of  NashvUle. 


REFLECTIONS 

OF 

A 

TEACHER 

Why  does  one  decide  to  teach? 
The  old  cliche  suggests  that  brick 
layers  receive  a greater  financial 
reward  for  their  efforts.  Ccrtninly 
money  Is  not  the  motivation.  Per- 
haps the  teacher  relishes  the  per- 
sonal power.  After  all.  a con- 
glomeration of  little  people  must 
Jump  at  every  lash  of  his  verbal 
whip.  And  yet,  a business  execu- 
tive. an  army  officer,  the  foreman 
on  a work  gang— all  exert  more 
ego-satisfying  power  influence.  Not 
money,  not  power;  then  what? 
•Teaching  is  a lazy  man's  pro- 
fession," I was  once  told.  As  I 
glance  over  at  my  stack  of  un- 
graded English  themes  and  Latin 
tests  and  assignments  to  prepare. 
I see  the  fallacy  in  this  line  of 
argument.  Teaching  is  no  softly 
sloping  ski  slope  that  one  can 
slide  leisurely  down. 

As  I watch  the  smoke  from  that 
last  cigarette  curl  lazily  around 
the  lamp;  as  I listen  to  the  sounds 
of  the  spring  night  from  my  win- 
dow. I must  ponder.  What  does 
teaching  give?  What  does  it  re- 
ceive? 

The  teacher,  I have  read,  is  a 
catalyst.  He  must  be  that  trans- 
forming agent,  that  bridge  be- 
tween brute  knowledge  and  the 
student’s  understanding.  He  must 
also  be  an  example,  moral  and  in- 
tellectual— a chord  of  perfect  pitch 
by  which  the  student  tunes  the 
chords  of  his  own  fibre.  Ideally, 
the  teacher  as  the  virtue  of  a saint, 
and  none  of  the  sins  of  a demon. 
Above  all.  the  teacher  must  have 
a desire,  a desire  to  get  outside  of 
himself,  to  communicate  to  others, 
to  help,  to  help  the  mind  of  youth 
grasp  haltlingly  and  hopefully  to- 
ward that  great  god  of  education. 
Intellectual  Maturity. 

Yet  who  can  reach,  ever,  this 
lofty  peak  of  teacherdom.  We  are 
human,  and  being  human,  we  are 
imperfect,  neither  saint  nor  demon 
but  a bit  of  both.  We  can  not  get 
completely  out  of  ourselves  be- 
cause, being  human,  we  are  so 
wrapped  up  In  ourselves.  In  short, 
no  man  can  be  the  perfect  teacher. 

Then,  we  are  back  where  we  be- 
gan. Why  try?  Why  make  the 
attempt?  There  Is  an  ancient  myth 
relevant  to  this  question.  So  the 
story  goes,  there  was  once  a man, 
Sysiphus  by  name,  whose  task  it 
was  to  roll  a stone  of  enormous 
size  up  a steep  hill.  Sysiphus 
would  manage  to  push  the  rock  al- 
most to  the  top  on  each  attempt, 
but  each  time  the  rock  would  tum- 
ble down  to  the  base  of  the  hill  as 
Sysiphus  watched  helplessly.  Yet 
he  did  not  give  up.  He  would  con- 
tinue to  try  to  push  the  rock  to  the 
top;  it  would  continue  to  roll  to 
the  bottom.  Sysiphus,  moreover, 
knew  that  he  would  never  attain 
his  goal,  his  perfection.  And  yet 
he  joyfully  continued  to  try. 

We  who  teach  cannot  push  our 
stones  to  the  top  of  the  educa- 
tional hill;  we  cannot  be  saints; 
we  cannot  encompass  all  knowl- 
edge nor  communicate  all  knowl- 
edge. But  we  can  try. 

The  answer  to  the  question  lies 
in  the  very  nobility  of  the  at- 
tempt. All  teachers  contain  to 
some  degree  a love  of  knowledge 


and  a desire  to  communicate  that 
love  and  a portion  of  that  knowl- 
edge. The  teacher  knows  he  will 
be  an  eternal  failure,  that  he  will 
never  succeed  in  any  total  sense. 
But  he  knows  he  must  try. 

One  teaches  then  because  of  his 
love  for  knowledge  and  his  desire 
to  communicate,  to  help.  In  order 
to  make  his  attempt,  he  needs 
three  things;  a degree  of  knowl- 
edge, imperfect  though  It  may  be; 
an  ability  to  communicate,  imper- 
fect as  it  may  be;  and  receptors, 
students,  imperfect  as  they  must 
be. 

One  gains  his  knowledge  as  he 
plods  through  the  giant  educa- 
tional machinery — from  grammar 
school  through  college  or  graduate 
school.  Here  the  technical  educa- 
tional machine  grinds  to  a halt. 
Has  one  thus  reached  his  knowl- 
edge capacity  once  finished  with 
all  the  required  courses?  Let  us 
hope  not.  Knowledge,  like  God, 
is  infinite;  and  the  human  mind 
must  continually  stretch  toward 
this  infinity.  One  secs  so  many 
examples  of  the  expansiveness  of 
knowledge  these  days.  In  the 
fields  of  technology,  science,  medi- 
cine, politics,  change  has  become 
the  rule;  and  the  teacher,  If  he 
is  to  make  his  attempt,  must  keep 
abreast  of  these  changes. 

If  knowledge  is  the  prime  re- 
quisite of  the  teaching  attempt, 
then  method  is  a necessary  corol- 
lary Communication  of  knowl- 
edge is  necessarily  a trial  by  er- 
ror process.  A teacher  might  be 
subjected  to  an  infinity  of  technical 
"education"  courses  designed  to 
aid  him  in  his  communication;  yet 
his  own  method  of  communication, 
like  his  extent  of  knowledge,  must 
be  imperfect.  No  absolute  method 
of  communication  exists.  The  In- 
dividual teacher  must  be  flexible, 
adopting  his  desire  to  communi- 
cate to  the  course  of  study,  the 
type,  of  student,  the  time  of  day, 
the  climatic  conditions,  etc.,  etc. 

As  the  final  Item  in  the  make-up 
of  the  teaching  process  is  the  stu- 
dent. Obviously,  one  could  not 
teach  without  the  receptors  of  the 
communicated  knowledge.  But 
what  type  of  student  is  necessary 
to  the  teaching  process?  The  stu- 
dent should  first  of  all  realize  that 
teachers  are  human  beings,  cap- 
able of  errors.  As  we  have  sug- 
gested, no  teacher  can  attain  per- 
fection. The  student  must  not  ex- 
pect miracles.  Intellectual  or  moral 
from  his  instructor.  Moreover,  the 
student  should  try  to  enter  Into  his 
role  with  hope  and  with  excite- 
ment. He  should  look  at  knowl- 
edge with  a sense  of  expectation. 
The  learning  process  can  be  a re- 
warding experience.  Furthermore, 
it  is  the  duty  of  the  teacher  to  help 
to  lead  the  student  toward  knowl- 
edge, to  make  the  learning  process 
an  exciting  one. 

Knowledge,  communication,  stu- 
dents— these  ure  the  essential  ele- 
ments of  teaching.  In  all  Its  Im- 
perfection, teaching  attempts  to 
bring  the  student  to  knowledge 
through  communication.  This  is 
what  teaching  attempts  to  give. 
But  what  does  the  teacher  receive 
for  his  often  futile  efforts?  The 
financial  reward  is  slight,  the  har- 
assments  are  many.  Where  can 
the  teacher  find  his  satisfaction. 
As  we  have  suggested  the  teacher 
cannot  bask  in  his  perfection,  for 
his  job  is  necessarily  colored  by  a 
sense  of  futility.  But  he  can  take 
heart  in  his  approach  to  perfec- 
tion. If  the  teacher  can  aid  in 
moving  the  mind  of  the  student 
an  Inch,  he  has  succeeded.  Suc- 
cess is  limited,  but  there  is  an 
ocassional  success.  This  success  in 
the  occupation  of  helping  others 
is  the  only  justification,  the  only 
real  reward

Who  is  Tampering  with  the 
Soul  of  America? 


Jenkin  Lloyd  Jones  50,  is  Editor  of  The  Tulsa,  Oklahoma,  Tribune,  a position  he  has  held  since  he  was  30. 

He  was  bom  in  Madison,  Wisconsin.  His  father,  Richard  Lloyd  Jones,  was  Editor  and  owner  of  The 
Wisconsin  State  Journal,  and  sold  the  paper  to  the  Lee  Group,  present  owners  in  1917. 

Jenkins  was  graduated  from  the  University  of  Wisconsin  in  1933.  Except  for  time  out  in  World  War  II, 
when  he  served  as  a navy  communications  officer,  taking  part  in  the  Iwo  Jima  and  Okinawa  campaigns  aboard 
the  USS  Makasser  Strait,  he  has  been  on  the  news  and  editorial  staff  of  The  Tulsa  Tribune. 

He  has  earned  a reputation  as  a skilled  reporter  and  an  informed  and  clear-voiced  editor.  The  influence 
of  his  editorial  page  extends  far  beyond  the  borders  of  his  home  city. 


Jones  is  a grandson  and  namesake  of  the  well-known  Unitarian  clergyman  who  helped  organize  Henry 
Ford’s  World  War  I Peace  Ship.  He  is  a nephew  of  the  late  Frank  Lloyd  Wright. 


This.  ladle*  and  gentlemen,  la 
to  be  a jeremiad. 

I am  about  to  inflict  upon  you 


an  unrelieved,  copper-bottomed, 
six-ply,  all  wood,  23-minute  howl 
of  calamity  about  the  present 
moral  climate  of  America.  And 
I am  going  to  talk  about  our  re- 
sponsibilities therefor  as  the  tem- 
porary custodians  of  America's 


You  may  dismiss  such  fogey  ism 
with  a tolerant  laugh.  But  the 
pathway  of  history  is  littered  with 
the  bones  of  dead  states  and  fallen 
empires.  Most  of  them  rotted  out 
before  they  were  overwhelmed. 
And  they  were  not,  in  most  cases, 
promptly  replaced  by  something 
better. 

Nearly  1,000  years  elapsed  be- 
tween the  fall  of  Western  Rome 
and  the  rise  of  the  Renaissance, 
and  in  between  we  had  the  Dark 
Ages  in  which  nearly  all  of  man's 
institutions  were  inferior  to  those 
which  had  gone  before.  1 don't 
want  my  children's  children  to 
pass  through  a couple  of  centuries 
of  dialectic  materialism  before  the 
sun  comes  up  again. 


It  IS  sad  to  watch  the  beginnings 
of  decay.  It  was  sad  to  see  an  age 
of  Pericles  replaced  by  the 
drunken  riots  of  Alcibiades.  There 
was,  indeed,  just  cause  for  gloom 
when  the  Roman  mobs,  flabby  with 
free  bread  and  bemused  by  free 
circuses,  cheered  for  the  unspeak- 
able Nero  and  the  crazy  Caligula. 

Alaric’s  Goths  Anally  poured 
over  the  walls  of  Rome.  But  it 
was  not  that  the  walls  were  low. 
It  was  that  Rome,  itself,  was  low. 
The  sensual  life  of  Pompeii,  the 
orgies  on  Lake  Trasimene,  the 
gradually  weakened  fibre  of  a once 


self-disciplined  people— all  these 
brought  Rome  down.  She  went 
down  too  early.  She  had  much  to 
teach  the  world. 

And  so,  ladle*  and  gentlemen,  I 
look  upon  our  own  country  and 
much  that  I see  disturbs  me.  But 
we  are  a great  people.  We  have  a 
noble  tradition.  We  have  much 
to  teach  the  world,  and  if  America 
should  go  down  soon  it  would  be 
too  early. 

One  thing  is  certain.  We  shall 
be  given  no  centuries  for  a leis- 
urely and  comfortable  decay.  We 
have  an  enemy  now — remorseless, 
crude,  brutal  and  cocky.  How- 
ever much  the  leaders  of  the  Com- 
munist conspiracy  may  lie  to  their 
subjects  about  our  motives,  about 
our  conditions  of  prosperity,  our 
policies  and  aims,  one  thing  they 
believe  themselves  implicitly — 
and  that  is  that  we  are  in  an  ad- 
vanced state  of  moral  decline. 

It  is  a dogma  of  current  Com- 
munist faith  that  America  is 
Sodom  and  Gomorrah,  ready  for 
the  kill. 


Uo  YOU  know  what  scares  me 
about  the  Communists? 

It's  not  their  political  system, 
which  is  primitive  and  savage.  It’s 
not  their  economic  system  which 
works  so  badly  that  progress  in  a 
few  directions  is  purchased  at  the 
price  of  progress  in  all  the  rest.  It 
is  their  puritanism. 

It  does  no  good  to  comfort  our- 
selves with  the  reflection  that  these 
are  the  products  of  endless  brain- 
washings, of  incessant  propaganda, 
of  deprivation  by  censorship  and 
jamming  of  counter-information 
and  contrary  arguments  The 
confidence  that  they  are  morally 
superior  is  there. 


You  can’t  get  very  far  Into  Rus- 
sia before  the  naive  questions  of 
your  Intourist  guide  reveal  that 
she  thinks  she  is  talking  to  a soft 
fop  who  is  ripe  for  the  tumbrill 
and  the  guillotine.  In  the  school- 
yard  the  children  rush  up  to  show 
you,  not  their  yoyos,  but  their 
scholarship  medals  And  when 
you  offer  them  new  Lincoln  pen- 
nies as  souvenirs  they  rip  off  their 
little  Young  Pioneer  buttons  and 
hand  them  to  you.  proud  that  they 
are  not  taking  gifts,  but  are  mak- 
ing a fair  exchange. 

The  Russian  stage  is  as  austere 
as  the  Victorian  stage.  Russian 
literature  may  be  corny,  but  it's 
clean,  and  it  glorifies  the  Russian 
people  and  exudes  optimism  and 
promise.  Russian  art  is  stiffly  rep- 
resentational, but  the  paintings 
and  the  sculpture  strive  to  depict 
beauty  and  h e r o 1 s m— Russian 
beauty,  of  course,  and  Russian 
heroism. 

A ND  what  of  us? 

Well,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  let's 
take  them  one  at  a time: 

w E ARE  now  at  the  end  of  the 
third  decade  of  the  national  in- 
sanity known  as  “progessive  edu- 
cation” This  is  the  education 
where  everybody  passes,  where 
the  report  cards  are  non-commit- 
tal lest  the  failure  be  faced  with 
the  fact  of  his  failure,  where  all 
move  at  a snail  pace  like  a trans- 
Atlantic  convoy  so  that  the  slowest 
need  not  be  left  behind,  and  all 
proceed  toward  adulthood  in  the 
lockstep  of  “togetherness." 

With  what  results?  At  an  age 
when  European  kids  are  studying 
the  human  capillary  system  and 
discussing  the  binomial  theorem 


our  youngsters  are  raising  polly- 
wogs  on  the  classroom  windowsill 
and  pretending  to  keep  store.  This 
is  what  Is  known  as  "learning  by 
doing."  We  have  produced  tens 
of  thousands  of  high  school  grad- 
uates who  move  their  lips  as  they 
read  and  cannot  write  a coherent 
paragraph.  While  our  Russian  con- 
temporaries, who  were  supposed 
to  be  dedicated  to  the  mass  man, 
have  been  busy  constructing  an 
elite  we  have  been  engaged  in  the 
wholesale  production  of  medio- 
crity. What  a switch! 

I WISH  you  could  have  read  all 
the  letters  I have  received  In  the 
past  few  months  from  disgusted 
teachers  who  have  tried  to  rein- 
troduce principles  of  hard  work 
and  Integrity  In  their  classrooms 
over  the  opposition  of  the  school 
hierarchies.  It  Is  high  time  that 
these  Ph.D.'d  pooh-bahs  of  John 
Dewey  Ism  stepped  forward  and 
permitted  themselves  to  be  graded. 
But  no. 

You  recall  that  last  fall  the 
school  board  of  the  little  town- 
ship of  Twin  Lakes,  Wisconsin, 
dissatisfied  with  modern  primers, 
announced  that  it  was  introducing 
reprint*  of  80-year-old  McGuffey 
Readers.  Maybe  it  was  making  a 
bad  mistake.  Maybe  the  new 
books  and  new  teaching  methods 
are  far  superior.  Here  was  a fine 
chance  to  find  out. 

But  did  the  Wisconsin  State 
Board  of  Education  offer  a sport- 
ing challenge — a one-year  test,  for 
example,  to  see  which  was  the 
better  approach,  theirs  or  Mc- 
Guffey’s?  Not  a bit  of  it  The 
State  Board  merely  moved  to  de- 
prive Twin  Lakes  of  state  aid,  to 
the  thunderous  applause,  I’m  sorry 
to  say,  of  the  so-called  "liberals." 


Montgomery  Bell  Academy 


When  was  the  last  time  you,  as 
editors,  examined  the  curricula  of 
your  local  schools?  Are  your  stu- 
dents given  the  standardized  Iowa 
and  Stanford  tests,  and,  if  so,  how 
did  your  schools  rank  compared 
to  the  national  average?  Do  your 
kids  bring  home  meaningful  re- 
port cards,  or  are  parents  just  get- 
ting a lot  of  gobbledegook  about 
adjustments  and  attitudes?  When 
was  the  last  time  you  asked  to 
look  at  any  senior  English  themes? 
When  have  you  given  a fine  pic- 
ture spread  to  your  town's  best 
scholars? 

H AVING  generally  neglected 
disciplines  in  education  it  was 
quite  logical  that  we  Americans 
should  neglect  disciplines  in  art. 
The  great  painters  and  sculptors 
of  the  past  studied  anatomy  so 
diligently  that  many  of  them 
snatched  bodies.  And  today,  after 
many  centuries,  we  stare  at  the 
ceiling  of  the  Sistine  Chapel  or  at 
the  walls  of  the  Rcichsmusee  and 
marvel  at  their  works. 

But  this  self-discipline  is  of  lit- 
tle concern  to  the  modern  non- 
objective  painter.  All  he  needs  is 
pigment  and  press  agent.  He  can 
stick  bits  of  glass,  old  rags  and 
quids  of  used  chewing  tobacco  on 
a board  and  he  is  a social  critic. 
He  can  drive  a car  back  and  forth 
in  pools  of  paint  and  Life  maga- 
zine will  write  him  up. 

Talent  is  for  squares.  What  you 
need  is  vast  effrontery.  This  is 
the  kind  of  art  that  a painter  with 
no  ability  can  paint,  and  a teacher 
with  no  ability  can  teach.  No  won- 
der it’s  popular  at  the  factory  end. 
But  the  tiny  minority  of  young- 
sters who  might  have  the  spark 
of  a Titian  or  a Rembrandt  within 
them  stay  unencouragcd  and  un- 
recognized. And  our  museums  arc 
filled  with  splashes,  cubes  and 
blots  being  stared  at  by  confused 
citizens  who  haven’t  the  guts  to 
admit  they  arc  confused. 

But  fakery  in  art  is  a light  cross 
we  bear.  Much  more  serious  is 
our  collapse  of  moral  standards 
and  the  blunting  of  our  capacity 
for  righteous  indignation. 

Our  Puritan  ancestors  were  pre- 
occupied with  sin.  They  were  too 
preoccupied  with  it.  They  were 
hag-ridden  and  guilt-ridden  and 
theirs  was  a repressed  and  neu- 
rotic society.  But  they  had  horse- 
power. 

They  wrested  livings  from  the 
rocky  land,  built  our  earliest  col- 
leges, started  our  literature,  caused 
our  industrial  revolution,  and 
found  lime  in  between  to  fight  the 
Indians,  the  French  and  the  Brit- 
ish, to  bawl  for  abolition,  woman 
suffrage  and  prison  reform,  and 
to  experiment  with  graham  crack- 
ers and  bloomers  They  were  a 
tremendous  people. 

And  for  all  their  exaggerated 
attention  to  sin,  their  philosophy 
rested  on  a great  granite  rock. 
Man  was  the  master  of  his  soul. 
You  didn’t  have  to  be  bad.  You 
could  and  should  be  better.  And 
if  you  wanted  to  escape  the  eter- 
nal Arcs,  you’d  damned  well  bet- 
ter be. 

In  RECENT  years  all  this  has 
changed  in  America.  We  have  de- 
cided that  sin  is  largely  imaginary. 
We  arc  bemused  with  behaviorist 
psychology  which  holds  that  ab- 
stract things  like  insight,  will  and 
spirit  are  figments  of  the  imagina- 
tion. Man,  says  the  behaviorist,  is 
either  a product  of  a happy  com- 
bination of  genes  and  chromo- 
somes or  an  unhappy  combination. 
He  move*  in  an  environment  that 
will  tend  to  make  him  good  or 
that  will  tend  to  make  him  evil. 
He  is  just  a chip  tossed  helplessly 
by  forces  beyond  his  control,  and 
therefore  not  responsible. 

Well,  the  theory  that  misbehav- 
ior can  be  cured  by  pulling  down 
tenements  and  erecting  in  their 
places  elaborate  public  housing  is 
not  holding  water.  The  crime  rate 
continue  to  rise  along  with  our 
outlays  for  social  services. 

We  are  far  gone  in  fancy  eu- 
phemy.  There  are  no  lazy  bums 
any  more — only  “deprived  per- 
sons." It  is  impolite  to  speak  of 
thugs.  They  are  “underprivi- 
leged." Yet  the  swaggering,  duck- 
tailed young  men  who  boldly 
flaunt  their  gang  symbols  on  their 
motorcycle  jackets  are  far  more 


talents  is  not  a champion  of  our 
liberties.  The  healthy  man  who 
chooses  to  loaf  on  unemployment 
compensation  is  not  a defender  of 
human  freedom.  The  playwright 
who  would  degrade  us,  the  author 
who  would  profit  from  pandering 
to  the  worst  that’s  in  us.  are  no 
friends  of  ours. 

It’s  time  wc  hit  the  sawdust 
trail.  It’s  time  we  revived  the 
idea  that  there  is  such  a thing  as 
sin — Just  plain  old  willful  sin.  It 
is  time  we  brought  self-discipline 
back  into  style.  And  who  has  a 
greater  responsibility  at  his  hour 
than  we — the  gentlemen  of  the 

So  I suggest: 

Lets  look  at  our  educational 
institutions  at  the  local  level,  and 
if  Johnny  can’t  read  by  the  time 
he's  ready  to  get  married  let’s  find 
out  why. 


L.ETS  look  at  the  distribution 
of  public  largesse,  and  if,  far  from 
alleviating  human  misery,  it  Is 
producing  the  sloth  and  irrespon- 
sibility that  intensifies  it,  let’s  get 
It  fixed. 

LeT’S  quit  being  bulldozed  and 
bedazzled  by  self-appointed  long- 
hairs.  Let's  have  the  guts  to  say 
that  a book  is  dirt  If  that's  what 
we  think  of  it,  or  that  a painting 
may  be  a daub  if  the  judges  un- 
wittingly hang  it  upside  down. 
And  if  some  beatnik  welds  to- 
gether a collection  of  rusty  cog- 
wheels and  old  corset  stays  and 
claims  it's  a greater  sculpture  than 
Michelangelo’s  “David"  let’s  have 
the  courage  to  say  that  it  looks 
like  junk  and  may  well  be. 

Lets  blow  the  whistle  on  plays 
that  would  bring  blushes  to  an 
American  Legion  stag  party.  Let's 
not  be  awed  by  movie  characters 
with  barnyard  morals  even  if 
some  of  them  have  been  photo- 
graphed climbing  aboard  the  Pres- 
idential yacht  Let  us  pay  more 
attention  in  our  news  columns  to 
the  decent  people  everywhere  who 
are  trying  to  do  something  for  the 
good  of  others. 


blessed  in  creature  comforts,  op- 
portunities for  advancement,  and 
freedom  from  drudgery  than  #0 
per  cent  of  the  children  of  the 
world.  Wc  have  sown  the  dragon’s 
teeth  of  pseudo-scientific  senti- 
mentality, and  out  of  the  ground 
has  sprung  the  legion  bearing 
switch-blade  knives  and  bicycle 
chains. 

Clearly  something  is  missing, 
could  it  be  what  the  rest  of  the 
world's  children  have  been  given 
— the  doctrine  of  individual  re- 
sponsibility? 

I don't  know  how  long  America 
can  stand  this  erosion  of  princi- 
ple But  if  we  wish  to  survive 
maybe  we  had  better  do  something 
about  the  elaborate  pretense  that 
there  is  no  difference  between  the 
genuincly-unfortunate  and  the 
mobs  of  reliefers  who  gather  to 
throw  bottles  every  time  the  cops 
try  to  make  a legitimate  arrest. 
The  welfare  state  that  taxes  away 
the  rewards  for  responsible  be- 
havior so  that  it  can  remove  the 
age-old  penalties  for  irresponsible 
behavior  in  building  on  a founda- 
tion of  Jelly. 

In  A SPEECH  a couple  of  months 
ago  in  Hartford,  Connecticut,  Mr 
Eric  Johnston,  president  of  the 
Motion  Picture  Association  of 
America,  asked  the  plaintive  ques- 
tion: "Why,  despite  our  unceasing 
efforts,  docs  the  film  industry  fall 
at  times  to  have  public  confi- 
dence?" 

Then  he  suggested  an  answer. 
The  movie  people  apologize  too 
much,  he  said  They  should  take 
pride  in  the  fact  that  they  have 
amended  their  production  code 
(Mr.  Johnston  apparently  uses  tire 
term  “amended"  when  he  means 
a general  tooth  extraction.) 

But  PERHAPS  the  most  intrigu- 
ing part  of  Mr.  Johnston's  speech 
dealt  with  newspaper  movie  ads. 
It  is  ridiculous,  he  said,  for  par- 
ents to  complain  about  bad  influ- 
ence by  movies  upon  their  chil- 
dren when  all  parents  have  to  do 
It  look  closely  at  the  ads 

“I  have  yet  to  run  across  a 
movie  ad  so  subtle,"  said  Mr. 
Johnston,  "that  a concerned  par- 
ent would  not  know  whether  the 
film  was  suitable  for  his  child." 

Well,  here  is  a semantical  pole- 
vault  that  ought  to  set  a world's 
record.  For  the  suggestive,  half- 
dressed  figures  locked  in  passion- 
ate embrace  that  have  been  dec- 
orating the  theatre  ads  in  our 
great  moral  dailies  are  now  re- 
vealed as  a public  service,  gener- 
ously paid  for  by  the  movie  mo- 
guls so  that  parents  can  be  warned! 

Last  year  our  advertising  man- 
ager and  I got  so  tired  of  Holly- 
wood's horizontal  art  that  we  de- 
cided to  throw  out  the  worst  and 
set  up  some  standards.  We  thought 
that  this  belated  ukase  of  ours 
might  cause  some  interruption  in 
advertising  some  shows  But  no. 
Within  a couple  of  hours  the  ex- 
hibitors were  down  wtih  much 
milder  ads.  How  was  this  miracle 
accomplished? 

It  seems  that  exhibitors  are  sup- 
plied with  several  different  ads  for 
each  movie.  If  the  publishers  are 
dumb  enough  to  accept  the  most 
suggestive  ones  those  are  what 
they  get.  But.  if  publishers 
squawk,  the  cleaner  ads  are  sent 
down.  Isn't  it  time  we  all 
squawked? 

I think  it’s  time  we  gentlemen 
of  the  press  quit  giving  Page  1 
play  to  Liz  and  Eddie.  I think  it’s 
time  we  asked  our  Broadway  and 
Hollywood  columnists  if  they  can’t 
find  something  decent  and  inspir- 
ing going  on  along  their  beats. 


/iND  there’s  our  literature  I 
presume  we  all  have  our  invita- 
tions to  become  charter  subscrib- 
ers of  Eros,  the  new  quarterly 
magazine  of  erotica  at  $10  a copy. 
I got  three  invitation,  so  either  the 
Addressograph  was  stuck  of  Pm 
considered  a hot  prospect 

Anyway,  the  publisher,  Ralph 
Ginzburg,  says  this,  and  I quote: 

“Eros  has  been  bora  as  a result 
of  the  recent  series  of  court  de- 
cisions that  have  realistically  in- 
terpreted  America’s  obscenity 
laws  and  that  have  given  to  this 
country  a new  breadth  of  freedom 
of  expression.” 

Isn’t  it  splendid  that  Mr.  Ginz- 
burg stands  with  the  frozen  ghosts 


of  Valley  Forge  as  a fearless  de- 
fender of  his  country’s  freedom? 
Ten  dollars,  please! 

T HE  fast  buck  boys  have  suc- 
ceeded in  convincing  our  bum- 
fuzzled  judges  that  there  is  no  dif- 
ference between  a peep  show  and 
a moral  lecture.  The  old  eye- 
poppers  which  tourists  used  to 
smuggle  back  from  Paris  under 
their  dirty  shirts  are  now  clothed 
in  judicial  blessing.  A Chicago 
judge  has  recently  issued  a blanket 
injunction  against  any  one  who 
might  try  to  prevent  the  sale  of 
Tropic  of  Cancer  to  children.  Lady 
Chattcrley's  Lover  and  Ulysses  are 
on  the  paperback  shelves  right 
next  to  the  comic  books.  They  can 
close  the  bookstalls  on  the  Seine. 
IPs  all  over  at  your  corner  drug- 
store where  the  kids  hang  out. 

Don  Maxwell  of  The  Chicago 
Tribune  last  year  asked  his  book 
department  to  quit  advertising 
scatological  literature  by  includ- 
ing it  in  the  list  of  best  sellers. 
The  critics  and  the  book  publish- 
ers have  denounced  him  for  tamp- 
ering with  the  facts.  I would  like 
to  raise  a somewhat  larger  ques- 
tion: 

Who  is  tampering  with  the 
soul  of  America? 

For  nations  do  have  souls.  They 
have  collective  personalities.  Peo- 
ple who  think  well  of  themselves 
collectively  exhibit  cleanness  and 
enthusiasm  and  morale.  Where 
they  low-rate  themselves  as  in- 
dividuals they  will  not  long  re- 
main the  citizens  of  great  nations. 

Dr  Celia  Deschin.  specialist  in 
medical  sociology  at  Adelphi  col- 
lege, in  a recent  article  in  The 
Week  magazine,  says  it’s  time  for 
a new  kind  of  Kinsey  Report.  She 
asserts  that  the  late  Doctor  Kinsey 
produced  a report  that  was  heavily 
loaded  by  exhibitionists  and  that 
did  Immense  damage  to  America 
by  peddling  the  impression  that 
sexual  self-discipline  neither  exists 
in  this  country  nor  is  It  desirable. 

Generally,  she  says,  those  par- 
ents who  are  afraid  to  lay  down 
the  law  have  the  moat  miserable 
children.  Children,  she  points  out, 
want  honest  direction  and  a set  of 
sensible  rules  to  live  by  Where 
these  are  denied  them  on  the  fan- 
tastic theory  that  it’s  no  longer 
scientific  to  say  no.  the  kids  often 
develop  subconscious  anxiety. 
Much  juvenile  delinquency  springs 
from  a deep  hunger  for  rules.  It 
Is  a masochistic  effort  to  seek  pun- 
ishment. The  child,  says  Doctor 
Deschin,  abhors  a world  where 
everything  goes. 

Or.  as  my  tough-minded  old 
grandmother  put  it,  "The  young- 
ster who  doesn’t  know  that  there’s 
a Lord  in  Israel  bounces  around 
in  a Umbo  where  there  is  no  force 
of  gravity.  If  you  think  he's  happy 
you’re  crazy." 

TT HE  time  has  come  to  dust  off 
the  rule  book  The  game  is  un- 
playable if  you're  allowed  two 
strikes  or  six.  If  you  can  use  a 
bat  or  a cannon,  and  If  some  days 
you  can  have  three  men  on  third 
and  other  days  there  isn’t  any 
third  base  at  all.  We  have  to  stop 
trying  to  make  up  our  own  rules. 

And  that  goes  for  all  of  us.  It’s 
time  to  quit  seeking  learning  with- 
out effort  and  wages  without  work. 
It’s  time  we  got  mad  about  payola. 
We  should  ask  the  Lord’s  forgive- 
ness for  our  inflated  expense  ac- 
counts, and  quit  pretending  that 
goonery  is  a human  right. 

LaDIES  and  gentlemen:  do  not 
let  me  overdraw  the  picture.  This 
is  still  a great,  powerful,  vibrant, 
able,  optimistic  nation.  Americans 
— our  readers — do  believe  in  them- 
selves and  in  their  country. 

But  there  is  rot,  and  there  is 
blight,  and  there  is  cutting  out  and 
filling  to  be  done  if  we,  as  the 
leaders  of  free  men.  are  to  sur- 
vive the  hammer  blows  which 
quite  plainly  are  in  store  for  us 
aU. 

We  have  reached  the  stomach- 
turning  point.  We  have  reached 
the  point  where  we  should  re- 
examine the  debilitating  philoso- 
phy of  permissiveness.  Let  this 
not  be  confused  with  the  philoso- 
phy of  liberty.  The  school  system 
that  permits  our  children  to  de- 
velop a quarter  of  their  natural 


In  short,  let's  cover  up  the  cess- 
pool and  start  planting  some 
flowers. 

Well  that’s  the  Jeremiad.  I 
never  dreamed  I'd  go  around 
sounding  like  an  advance  man  for 
Carry  Nation.  On  some  people  I 
still  think  bikinis  look  fine. 

But  I am  fed  up  to  here  with  the 
educationists  and  pseudo-social 
scientists  who  have  underrated  our 
potential  as  a people. 

I am  fed  up  to  here  with  the 
medicine  men  who  try  to  pass  off 
pretanse  for  art,  and  prurience  for 
literature. 

I am  tired  of  seeing  America  de- 
based in  the  eyes  of  foreigners. 

And  I am  genuinely  disturbed 
that  to  idealistic  youth  in  many 
countries  the  fraud  of  Commu- 
nism appears  synonymous  with 
morality,  while  we,  the  chief  re- 
pository of  real  freedom,  are  re- 
garded as  being  in  the  last  stages 
of  decay. 

We  can  learn  a lesson  from 
history.  Twice  before  our  British 
cousins  appeared  to  be  heading 
into  a collapse  of  principle,  and 
twice  they  drew  themselves  back. 
The  British  court  reached  an  ad- 
vanced stage  of  corruption  under 
the  Stuarts.  But  the  people  re- 
belled. And  in  the  wild  days  of 
George  IV  and  William  IV  it 
look  as  though  Britain  were  rat- 
ing out  again.  But  the  people 
banged  through  the  reform  laws, 
and  under  Victoria  went  on  to  the 
peak  of  their  power. 

In  this  hour  of  misbehavior, 
self-indulgence  and  self-doubt  let 
this  be  the  story  of  America.  Un- 
less I misread  the  signs  a great 
number  of  our  people  are  ready. 
Let  there  be  a fresh  breeze,  a 
breeze  of  new  pride,  new  idealism, 
new  integrity. 

And  here,  gentlemen,  is  where 
we  come  in. 

We  have  typewriters. 

We  have  presses. 

We  have  a huge  audience. 

How  about  raising  hell?
