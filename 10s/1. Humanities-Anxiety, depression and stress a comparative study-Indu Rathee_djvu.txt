ABSTRACT 


The  purpose  of  the  paper  is  to  understand  and  compare  the  experiences  of  anxiety,  depression  and  stress  among 
the  teachers  working  in  residential  and  non-residential  schools.  The  sample  comprised  of  60  teachers,  out  of  them 
30  teachers  (15  male  and  15  female)  were  from  residential  schools  and  30  teachers  (15  male  and  15  female)  were  from 
non-residential  schools  selected  randomly  from  four  schools  (two  residential  and  two  non-residential  schools)  of  district 
Sonipat,  Haryana.  Anxiety,  depression  and  stress  scale  (adss)  by  Bhatnagar,  Singh  and  Pandey  (2011)  was  used  to  assess 
anxiety,  depression  and  stress.  The  data  so  collected  was  analyzed  statistically  by  employing  mean,  S.D  and  t-test. 
The  results  revealed  that  there  is  no  significant  difference  between  teachers  working  in  residential  and  non-residential 
schools  with  regard  to  their  anxiety,  depression  and  stress.  However,  anxiety  and  stress  level  of  female  teachers  of 
non-residential  schools  are  significantly  higher  than  male  teachers.

Stress  is  an  unavoidable  part  of  an  individual's  working  life.  Over  the  last  decades,  teaching  has  been  widely 
acknowledged  as  a  profession  full  of  stress  and  anxiety.  The  number  of  teachers  suffering  from  stress-related 
illnesses  -  particularly  depression  and  anxiety  -  seems  to  be  on  the  increase.  Such  distressing  symptoms  are  brought  about 
by  teachers'  current  working  conditions  and  the  pressures  under  which  they  find  themselves.  Kyriacou  (2000)  mentioned 
that  the  level  of  teaching  stress  led  to  teaching  being  categorized  as  one  of  high  stress  occupation  parallel  to  other  stressful 
jobs  like  the  police,  the  prison  service,  air  traffic  controllers,  doctors  and  nurses.  All  types  of  stressors  are  considered  as 
barriers  or  difficulties  perceived  by  teachers  that  interfere  with  or  hinder  the  instructional  process  carried  out  to  achieve 
learning  objectives  and  which  would  explain  a  high  level  of  burnout  (Schwarzer  &  Greenglass,  1999;  Blase,  1982). 
Anxiety  as  one  aspect  of  stress  among  teachers  can  affect  the  quality  of  teaching  in  the  class  which,  in  turn,  brings  about 
some  hardships  in  facilitating  the  process  of  learning  and  meeting  the  course  objectives.  Anxiety  is  a  subjective  state  of 
internal  discomfort.  It  is  a  normal  emotion  with  adaptive  value,  in  that  it  acts  as  a  warning  system  to  alert  a  person  to 
impending  danger.  Anxiety  often  occurs  without  conscious  or  apparents  stimulus,  which  distinguishes  it  from  fear 
(Gurian  &  Miner,  1991). 

Anxiety  may  be  focused  on  a  specific  object,  situation,  or  activity  (a  phobia)  or  may  be  unfocused  and  expressed 
as  a  more  general  dread.  The  five  major  types  being:  Panic  Disorder,  Obsessive-Compulsive  Disorder,  Post-Traumatic 
Stress  Disorder,  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  and  Phobias  (Anxiety  Disorders  of  America,  2005).  Depression  is  the  most 
likely  adverse  psychological  outcome,  the  range  of  other  possible  "psychological"  problems  include  "burn-  out,"  alcohol 
abuse,  unexplained  physical  symptoms,  "absenteeism,"  chronic  fatigue  and  accidents,  sick  building  syndrome  and

repetitive  strain  injury  (Hotopf,  Wessely,  1997).  Sadness  and  rejection  are  the  most  silent  emotional  symptoms  of 
depression.  The  individual  feels  hopeless  and  unhappy;  equally  preserve  is  loss  of  gratification  or  pleasure  in  life. 
Activities  that  used  to  bring  satisfaction  become  dull  and  joyless;  the  depressed  person  gradually  loss  interest  in  hobbies, 
recreation,  and  family  activities.  Depression  is  associated  with  a  constellation  of  psychological,  behavioral  and  physical 
symptoms  as  well  (Cassano  &  Fava,  2002).  The  depressed  person  has  negative  thoughts,  low  self-esteem  and  low 
motivation  for  progress.  Stress  is  a  complex  issue  but  generally  it  is  defined  as  a  physical,  mental,  or  emotional  reaction 
resulting  from  an  individual's  response  to  environmental  tensions,  conflicts,  pressures,  and  similar  stimuli 
(Fontana,  Abouserie,  1993).  Stress  is  often  described  as  being  associated  with  emotions  such  as  anger,  anxiety  and 
depression  and  there  is  evidence  to  suggest  that  it  is  also  related  to  impoverished  mental  health  (Cooper,  1996).  In  a  study, 
Daniel  Veronica  (201 1)  found  that  Gender  produces  significant  differences  in  the  level  of  experienced  anxiety. 

In  comparison  with  their  male  counterparts,  women  suffered  from  higher  level  of  anxiety  and  depression 
(Veronica  2011).  Individual  responses  to  stressful  situations  can  vary  greatly  and  it  has  been  shown  that  certain  people  are 
more  likely  to  experience  high  levels  of  stress  in  their  job  than  others  (Fontana,  Abouserie,  1993).  It  was  found  that  only 
"work  set-up"  accounted  for  significant  differences  in  stress  level  (Kumar  &  Beo  2011).  What's  more,  it  was  found  that 
female  teachers  suffer  from  more  stress  in  comparison  to  their  male  counterparts.  The  level  of  anxiety  or  stress  is  not  the 
only  variation  between  two  different  genders.  The  type  of  stressors  also  can  be  distinct  between  them.  For  example, 
Green  glass  and  Burke  (2003)  proposed  that  the  elevated  job  stress  of  females  might  stem  from  gender  differences  in 
non-working  domains,  with  higher  total  workload  and  higher  role  conflict  between  work  and  family.  The  present  study 
investigates  the  anxiety,  depression  and  stress  among  the  secondary  school  teachers  working  in  residential  and 
non-residential  schools. 

OBJECTIVES  OF  THE  STUDY 

The  main  objectives  of  this  investigation  are  as  follow: 

•  To  measure  the  levels  of  anxiety,  depression  and  stress  among  the  secondary  school  teachers  working  in 
residential  and  non-residential  schools. 

•  To  find  out  whether  secondary  school  teachers  working  in  residential  and  non-residential  schools  significantly 
differ  on  anxiety,  depression  and  stress. 

•  To  find  out  whether  male  and  female  secondary  school  teachers  working  in  residential  schools  significantly  differ 
on  anxiety,  depression  and  stress. 

•  To  find  out  whether  male  and  female  secondary  school  teachers  working  in  non-residential  schools  significantly 
differ  on  anxiety,  depression  and  stress. 

HYPOTHESES 

•  Secondary  school  teachers  working  in  residential  and  non-residential  schools  do  not  significantly  differ  on 
anxiety,  depression  and  stress. 

•  Male  and  female  secondary  school  teachers  working  in  residential  schools  do  not  significantly  differ  on  anxiety, 
depression  and  stress.

Anxiety,  Depression  and  Stress:  A  Comparative  Study  of  School  Teachers  3 
Working  in  Residential  and  Non-Residential  Schools 

•     Male  and  female  secondary  school  teachers  working  in  non-residential  schools  do  not  significantly  differ  on 
anxiety,  depression  and  stress. 

METHODOLOGY 
Population  and  Sample 

In  this  study  investigator  consider  secondary  school  teachers  of  Sonipat  District  (Haryana  State)  as  population. 
From  the  population,  the  sample  consisted  of  60  teachers  randomly  selected  from  two  residential  and  two  non-residential 
schools.  15  male  teachers  and  15  female  teachers  from  residential  schools  and  15  male  teachers  and  15  female  teachers 
from  non-residential  schools  were  selected  randomly  as  sample. 

TOOLS  USED 

ANXIETY,  DEPRESSION  AND  STRESS  SCALE  (ADSS)  By  Bhatnagar  P.,  Singh  M.  and  Pandey  M.  (2011) 
was  used  to  assess  anxiety,  depression  and  stress  .ADSS  comprises  of  48  items  divided  in  to  three  subscales  which 
are-  1.  Anxiety  subscale-  comprises  of  19  items  covering  various  symptoms  that  are  manifestation  of  anxiety. 
2.  Depression  subscale  comprises  of  15  items  representing  the  different  symptoms  of  depression.  3.  Stress  subscale  having 
14  items  and  they  are  covering  the  symptoms  that  people  experience  in  the  state  of  stress.  Responses  of  the  items  are  in 
terms  of  yes  or  no. 

PROCEDURE 

Descriptive  survey  method  of  research  was  employed  for  the  present  study.  The  tool  employed  in  the  study  were 
administered  on  the  teachers  of  residential  and  non-residential  schools.  The  response  received  was  analyzed  through 
statistical  applications  using  percentage  for  studying  the  level  of  frustration  of  teachers  and  t-test  for  comparison  of 
frustration  of  teachers  in  the  light  of  objectives.

Table  1  shows  that  normal  level  of  anxiety,  depression  and  stress  are  common  for  most  of  the  school  teachers. 
Most  of  the  teachers  (78%)  experience  normal  level  of  anxiety  while  only  3%  teachers  feel  severe  anxiety  problem. 
20%  teachers  are  suffering  from  moderate  level  of  depression,  66%  teachers  feel  normal  depression  at  different  times. 
Stress  is  a  common  problem  among  school  teachers  as  evidences  shows  that  63%  teachers  feel  normal  stress  but  out  of 
60  school  teachers  7%  are  working  under  severe  stress.

Table  1  shows  that  there  is  no  significant  differences  between  the  teachers  working  in  residential  schools  and 
non-residential  schools  on  anxiety,  depression  and  stress.  The  obtained  t-values  on  anxiety,  depression  and  stress  are  0.15, 
0.06  and  0.71  are  not  significant  at  0.05  level  of  significant.  The  teachers  working  in  residential  as  well  as  non-residential 
schools  experience  same  level  of  anxiety,  depression  and  stress  problems.  Hence  the  hypothesis  first,  i.e., 
"Secondary  school  teachers  working  in  residential  and  non-residential  schools  do  not  significantly  differ  on  anxiety, 
depression  and  stress."  is  accepted.

It  is  evident  from  the  Table  3  that  the  mean  scores  of  male  and  female  teachers  of  residential  schools  on  anxiety 
are  3.6  and  2.13  respectively.  The  t-ratio  of  both  groups  is  1.77  which  is  not  significant.  It  indicates  that  in  residential 
schools  male  and  female  teachers  experience  more  or  less  same  level  of  anxiety.  In  case  of  depression  male  teachers  had 
more  scores  than  female  teachers  but  it  was  not  significant  as  t  ratio  obtained  is  0.29  but  in  case  of  stress  female  mean 
value  is  higher  than  male  teachers  witch  is  also  not  significant.  Thus  hypothesis  2  that  Male  and  female  secondary  school 
teachers  working  in  residential  schools  do  not  significantly  differ  on  anxiety,  depression  and  stress  is  retained.

From  the  table  4,  it  is  clear  that  Female  teachers  working  in  Non-residential  schools  had  significantly  higher 
anxiety  and  stress  scores  than  male  teachers.  The  mean  anxiety  scores  for  male  and  female  teachers  were  1.6  and 
3.8  respectively  and  the  mean  stress  scores  for  male  and  female  teachers  were  1.73  and  5.6  respectively.  This  shoes  that 
female  teachers  experience  more  anxiety  and  stress  than  male  teachers.  However,  male  and  female  teachers  did  not  differ 
significantly  in  their  depression  scores  as  the  obtained  t  value  failed  to  reach  significance  level  criterion.  Thus  the 
hypothesis-3  i.e."  Male  and  female  secondary  school  teachers  working  in  non-residential  schools  do  not  significantly  differ 
on  anxiety,  depression  and  stress"  is  accepted  in  case  of  depression  and  rejected  in  case  of  anxiety  and  stress.

Anxiety,  Depression  and  Stress:  A  Comparative  Study  of  School  Teachers  5 
Working  in  Residential  and  Non-Residential  Schools 

Major  Findings  of  the  Study 

The  data  collected  through  the  investigation  showed  that  teachers  working  in  residential  and  non-residential 
schools  suffer  from  normal  level  of  anxiety,  depression  and  stress.  In  addition,  3%  to  7%  of  the  teachers  experience  severe 
anxiety,  depression  and  stress  problems.  It  was  found  that  the  teachers  working  in  residential  and  non-residential  schools 
do  not  differ  significantly  regarding  anxiety,  depression  and  stress  problems.  Further,  it  was  found  that  the  male  and  female 
teachers  of  residential  schools  also  do  not  differ  significantly  on  anxiety,  depression  and  stress  problems.  In  case  of 
non-residential  schools,  female  teachers  suffer  more  from  anxiety  and  stress  but  male  and  female  teachers  of 
non-residential  schools  do  not  differ  significantly  regarding  depression.  The  male  and  female  teachers  of  non-residential 
schools  also  do  not  differ  significantly  in  their  frustration.
