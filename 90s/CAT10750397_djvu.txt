mental  income,  and  job  training 
to  persons  55  years  of  age  and 
older  who  meet  economic  cri¬ 
teria  established  by  the  U.S. 
Department  of  Labor. 

®  Training  and  transition  to  the 
:v:;f job  market. 

•  A  source  of  needed  but  other¬ 
wise  unfunded  work  in  commu¬ 
nities  and  on  public  lands. 

The  Forest  Service  is  a  national 
sponsor  of  the  program  and  uti¬ 
lizes  enrollees  in  various  roles 
supporting  its  regular  activities. 
The  positions  cover  a  wide  range 
of  activities,  including  clerical, 
construction,  maintenance,  edu¬ 
cation,  engineering,  and  many 
outdoor  tasks  associated  with 
managing  forest  lands. 


Congratulations!  You  are  now  part  of 
the  Senior  Community  Service 
Employment  Program,  which  is  highly 
respected  by  the  USDA  Forest  Service. 
Enrollees  in  the  program  have  estab¬ 
lished  a  reputation  as  reliable,  produc¬ 
tive,  and  resourceful  contributors  to  the 
Forest  Service  mission  of  “ Caring  for 
the  Land  and  Serving  People.  ” 

This  brochure  is  designed  to  give  you  a 
brief  overview  of  the  program.  We 
encourage  you  to  ask  any  questions 
during  the  course  of  your  enrollment. 

We  will  do  our  best  to  keep  you 
informed  and  prepared  for  your  work, 
and  we  are  sure  you  will  be  pleased  with 
your  role  as  part  of  the  Forest  Service 
team.

Hours  of  Work 

You  are  entitled  to  work  no  less  than  an 
average  of  20  hours  each  week.  It  is 
possible  to  work  a  maximum  of  1 ,300 
hours  per  program  year  (July  1  to  June 
30),  but  you  may  work  less  due  to  bud¬ 
get  constraints.  At  the  beginning  of 
each  program  year,  an  income  eligibility 
recertification  and  a  physical  examina¬ 
tion  are  required. 

Pay 

You  will  be  paid  no  less  than  the 
Federal  or  State  minimum  wage, 
whichever  is  higher.  Some  enrollees’ 
wages  may  be  increased  because  of 
supervisory  duties  or  special  skills 
required  by  specific  jobs. 

This  program  does  not  authorize  or  pay 
for  overtime. 

Your  first  paycheck  will  probably  not 
arrive  for  at  least  3  1/2  weeks  due  to 
processing  procedures.  However,  after 
that  time  you  will  receive  a  check  every 
2  weeks. 

Social  Security  will  be  deducted  from 
your  pay  even  though  you  may  be 
receiving  a  monthly  Social  Security 
pension  check. 

You  may  select  not  to  have  income  tax 
deducted  from  your  pay. 


Leave 

You  will  earn  1  hour  of  excused 
absence  (leave)  for  every  20  hours  you 
work.  You  may  accumulate  leave  hours 
throughout  the  year,  and  they  may  be 
carried  over  after  July  1  to  the  next  pro¬ 
gram  year.  There  is  no  carryover  limit. 
There  is  no  provision  to  pay  you  in  cash 
for  the  unused  hours  of  accumulated 
leave.  This  leave  time  is  counted  in  your 
1 ,300-hour  allotment. 

Earned  leave  hours  may  be  used  when 
you  are  sick  and  for  medical  and  dental 
appointments,  personal  business,  or 
vacation. 

It  is  important  that  you  notify  your 
supervisor  in  advance  when  you  plan  to 
use  your  leave. 

Holidays 

You  will  receive  holiday  pay  if  a  Federal 
holiday  falls  on  your  regularly  scheduled 
workday.  The  following  are  Federal  holi¬ 
days: 


New  Year’s  Day 

•  Labor  Day 

Martin  Luther  King, 

•  Columbus 

Jr.'s  Birthday 

Day 

Presidents’  Day 

•  Veterans

Training 

The  Forest  Service  will  provide  you  with 
training  and  work  experience  to  en¬ 
hance  your  job  skills  and  employability. 

Placement 

Our  objective  is  to  help  you  by  training 
you  for  higher  paying  jobs  and  to  assist 
you  in  obtaining  regular  employment. 
You  should  gain  self-confidence, 
acquire  new  job  skills,  or  brush  up  on 
skills  you  already  have.  The  goal  is  for 
you  to  leave  this  work-training  program 
when  you  have  a  good  full-  or  part-time 
job  waiting  for  you  with  a  private 
employer,  and  in  some  cases  with  the 
Forest  Service  itself.  Many  enrollees 
have  left  the  program  to  take  exciting 
and  rewarding  jobs.  We  want  to  help 
you  do  the  same.  It  is  your  responsibility 
to  cooperate  with  the  program  adminis¬ 
trator  by  attending  job  interviews  and 
locating  and  accepting  employment. 
This  will  create  opportunities  for  addi¬ 
tional  people  to  enroll  in  and  benefit 
from  the  SCSEP. 

Consideration  for  re-enrollment  will  be 
given  to  enrollees  who  become  unem¬ 
ployed  after  being  placed  in  an  unsubsi¬ 
dized  job. 

Recertification 

You  must  be  recertified  annually  to 
remain  in  the  program. 


Physical  Examination 

The  program  provides  funding  for  a 
physical  examination  at  reasonable 
cost,  before  you  report  to  work,  and 
once  a  year  thereafter.  The  purpose  of 
this  annual  physical  examination  is 
twofold: 

•  To  ensure  that  you  are  not  asked  to 
perform  duties  that  would  be  injurious 
to  you. 

•To  inform  you  of  any  physical  condi¬ 
tion  that  may  require  medical  atten¬ 
tion. 

Grievances  and  Equal 
Opportunity  (EEO)  Complaints 

You  are  afforded  due  process  and 
appeal  rights  related  to  job  perfor¬ 
mance,  adverse  actions,  or  civil 
rights-related  issues.  You  should  con¬ 
tact  your  Personnel  Officer  or  EEO 
Counselor  for  specific  details. 

Office  of  Workers’ 
Compensation  Program 
(OWCP) 

As  an  SCSEP  enrollee  you  are  covered 
by  the  Federal  Employees’ 
Compensation  Act  for  injuries  that 
occur  on  the  job.  If  you  suffer  a  work- 
related  illness  or  are  injured  on  the  job, 
contact  your  supervisor  immediately. 


Counseling 


022308196 


Counseling  as  it  pertains  to  your  work 
or  personal  situation  is  available  upon 
request.  Your  supervisor  can  help  you 
or  can  arrange  an  appointment  with 
appropriate  sources. 


Unemployment  Insurance 

Persons  who  have  participated  in  the 
SCSEP  are  not  eligible  for  State  unem¬ 
ployment  compensation  because  the 
program  does  not  contribute  to  State 
unemployment  programs. 


We  wish  you  success  in  the  Senior 
Community  Service  Employment 
Program  and  hope  that  it  will  be  an 
exciting  and  enjoyable  experience  for 
you.
