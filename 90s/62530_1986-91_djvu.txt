Chapter 7 Conclusion 


PREFACE 


In April 1992, I took up a part-time position as a Research Fellow at the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The 
aim of the ABS in providing these fellowships is to utilise the expertise of external researchers to enhance the range 
of analysis undertaken with the wealth of data collected by the bureau. My specific intention was to use data from the 
Census of Population and Housing to undertake a more detailed study of the position of indigenous Australians in the 
labour market and their associated economic status. At the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research (CAEPR) 
at the Australian National University, where I was then working, we were acutely aware of the limited amount of data 
available on the status of indigenous Australians. The census data are of particular importance in documenting the 
position of indigenous Australians because they are one of the few comprehensive sources of information which 
allows comparisons with other Australians. 


Over my two years at the ABS, I worked with both 1986 and 1991 census data. The results of much of this work 
have been published as work-in-progress in the discussion paper series of the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy 
Research at the Australian National University. 


I have many people to thank for both an interesting and enjoyable period at the ABS. I would especially like to thank 
Tim Skinner and Geoff Sims for being on my steering committee. Simone Knight, Jill McPadden, Cathy Blacker and 
Kate Ross were particularly helpful in the census division. One of the aims of the ABS fellowship scheme is to 
encourage co-operative research between ABS staff and academics. I was lucky enough to work with a group of very 
able ABS statisticians on modelling the labour force status of indigenous people. Bill Allen, Lousie Aufflick, Ed 
Bosworth and Martin Caruso established the model, using 1986 data, for investigating the determinants of labour force 
status of indigenous people. I have replicated it here using 1991 data (see chapter 2). I would like to thank them for 
their enthusiastic help. 


I also have many people to thank at the Australian National University. The staff at the Centre for Aboriginal 
Economic Policy Research have provided much valuable assistance and support. I would like to thank them all but 
particularly Jon Altman, Diane Smith and John Taylor for their comments on earlier drafts of the work presented in 
this monograph. Liu Jin provided valuable research assistance and Hilary Bek, Nicki Lumb, Linda Roach and 
Krystyna Szokalski made the task of putting this monograph together much easier because of their careful editing of 
the earlier discussion papers. 


I have also received assistance from the Reshaping Australian Institutions project in the Research School of Social 
Sciences at the Australian National University. My work on this monograph was partially funded through this project. 
I would like to thank Bob Gregory and George Fane for their encouragement and comments on earlier drafts. Eva 
Klug has also been a great help with the data. Of course, all remaining errors are my responsibility. 


The conclusions drawn and observations made by me are my own, and do not necessarily represent the views of the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics.

CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTION 


Australia’s indigenous population of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
people accounted for less than two per cent of the population recorded in 
the 1991 Census, yet they are regarded as a special group in a range of 
government programs. A number of factors distinguish indigenous people 
from other Australians.! As the indigenous inhabitants of the continent, 
they have had their lives changed dramatically by the arrival of European 
settlers. 


Not only does the history of indigenous people differ from that of other 
Australians but there are other important differences. Indigenous people 
are more concentrated in the younger age groups than are other 
Australians and are more likely to live outside major urban centres. It is 
well documented that the economic status of indigenous people in 
Australia, as measured by conventional indicators, falls behind that of 
other Australians. Aborigines have, on average, lower incomes, fewer are 
in employment and those who do work are occupied in less skilled jobs 
and concentrated in the public sector (Altman 1991; Tesfaghiorghis and 
Altman 1991, Taylor 1993°). 


The purpose of this monograph is to document some of the changes 
which have taken place in indigenous economic status over the last 
twenty years. The data source used here is the five-yearly census of 
population and housing for the period 1971-91 (see Altman and 
Nieuwenhuysen (1979), Fisk (1985), Altman (1991), Taylor 1993* and 
1993° for more detailed analyses of individual census years). 


The reliance on census data has both benefits and costs. The census is the 
only comprehensive source of information on the indigenous population 
collected at regular intervals. Information is available on the basis of 
fairly consistent definitions and it is possible to compare the position of 
indigenous people with that of other Australians. Other sources, notably 
case studies, document the economic position of particular groups of 
indigenous people in more detail, but it is difficult to generalise from 
these and they do not always permit comparisons with other Australians. 
There are however, certain difficulties associated with census data which 
must be considered. 


Since 1971, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been 
identified as such by their answers to a question of the form ‘Is the 
person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander origin?’ (question 13, 1991 
Census). This process of self identification creates some problems. It 
appears that people have changed their willingness to identify over time 
(Gray and Smith 1983, Choi and Gray 1985). This means that when 
longitudinal comparisons are made of such indicators as educational 
levels or industry of employment, the actual people included in the 
comparison may well differ. It is possible that those who have chosen to 
identify as indigenous people in more recent censuses are more closely 
integrated into mainstream society and are more like other Australians as 
measured by conventional social indicators than are the indigenous people 
who have always identified as such. The effect of the inclusion of this 
group may be to suggest improvements in these indicators which may not 
have taken place. 


| The terms indigenous, ‘Aboriginal’ and ‘Aborigines’ is used here to refer to the Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander populations of Australia. 


The educational attainment 
of indigenous people 


Collecting information from indigenous people in remote Australia has 
not been easy. Not only are there problems associated with locating 
people in remote parts of Australia, but also lack of formal education and 
the inappropriateness of some of the concepts used, have increased the 
difficulties associated with completing the census form. The Australian 
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has had a remote area strategy for census 
enumeration since 1976 and the quality of the census count coming from 
these areas has improved over time (see Taylor 1992*). However, the use 
of concepts appropriate to the wider Australian community in these quite 
different circumstances can create problems in interpreting the data (Smith 
1991). For example, what is the most appropriate classification for a 
hunter-gatherer with no money income from employment: ‘employed’ for 
the person is certainly working; ‘unemployed’ for the person may be 
willing to take up paid employment if offered the opportunity; or “not in 
the labour force’ as the activities being performed fall outside the 
conventional definitions of labour market activity? 


Lack of education and a general suspicion of government have also 
affected the quality of information collected from less remote indigenous 
Australians. For most questions, the ‘not stated’ category accounted for a 
larger proportion of indigenous than for other Australian responses. 
Although these problems associated with the use of census data need to 
be remembered, they are certainly not sufficient to invalidate its use as an 
indicator of indigenous economic status at an aggregate level, particularly 
given the lack of any better data covering the whole of the : 
self-identifying indigenous population. 


In order to establish the background for the analysis of contemporary 
economic status, this monograph begins by surveying the census data 
over the period 1971-91. The emphasis is on changes in indigenous 
labour force status including occupation and industry of employment, 
changes in income and in educational status. The remaining chapters 
focus on 1991 data. Chapters 2 and 3 use econometric models to consider 
the determinants of labour force status for indigenous and other 
Australians (chapter 2) and the determinants of income for those in 
full-time employment (chapter 3). Chapters 4 and 5 consider the labour 
market status of two age groups; youth at the beginning of their working 
life (chapter 4) and those over SO years of age at the end of their 
working life (chapter 5). Chapter 6 compares the characteristics of the 
indigenous and non-indigenous self-employed. Chapter 7 summarises the 
major results and also raises some issues for policy. 


It has been possible to cover this range of topics because of access to 
internal ABS data. Specifically, I have used the full Aboriginal sub-file of 
the 1991 Census and a one per cent sample of the full Census of the 
Australian population which was created for use within the ABS. These 
are referred to as ‘full Aboriginal sub-file’ and the ‘1 per cent ABS 
sample’ in the text. 


Although the focus of this monograph is the position of indigenous 
Australians in the labour market, it is appropriate to begin by presenting 
data on the educational attainment of the indigenous population. It is well 
established in the economic literature that education is an important 
determinant of both the labour force status and income of Aboriginal 
people.” These studies have used cross-section data and therefore relate to 
one period. Further research would be necessary to establish the effect of 


2 Studies on the determinants of employment status for indigenous people include Jones 
(1990, 1991), Miller (1989, 1991), Ross (1991), Daly (1993a) and Daly et al (1993). Studies 
on the determinants of Aboriginal employment income include Jones (1990) and Daly 
(1992a). See chapters 2 and 3 for 1991 estimates. 


rising education levels on the employment and income status of 
indigenous Australians over time. There is however, some evidence that 
rising levels of educational attainment have played an important part in 
increasing the incomes of minority groups in the US. (Krueger and Card 
1992). 


Two measures of comparative (indigenous and other Australians) 
educational attainment are presented here: the age on leaving school 
(Table 1.1) and the qualifications held (Table 1.2). In the interests of 
economy of space, data have been presented for the indigenous 
population in total as there were not major differences between the sexes. 
Both tables show a general trend of rising educational attainment, but the 
educational attainment of indigenous people remained well below that of 
other Australians. 


As Table 1.1 shows the percentage of the adult indigenous population 
who had not attended school fell from 14.3 per cent in 1976 to 5.4 per 
cent in 1991. This represents a 62.2 per cent decline in the share of the 
adult population who had not attended school. The share of those who 
Stayed at school at least until the age of 17 years more than doubled from 
8.6 per cent in 1976 to 20.6 per cent in 1991. While the percentage of 
the rest of the Australian population who had not attended school was 
very small and did not change over this period, there was also a large 
increase in those who had stayed on at school until the age of 17 years 
or more. 


The last section of the table presents the ratios of the indigenous to 
non-indigenous share in each age-on-leaving school category. Despite the 
substantial decline in the share of indigenous people who had not 
attended school, it remained over five times greater than the share of 
other Australians who had not attended school. Similarly, the increase in 
the ratio for those who had left school aged 17 years and over shows that

(a) Information on the school leaving age of the Aboriginal adult population not attending school was not presented in 1971. Data however, are available 
for the highest level of schooling for the whole Aboriginal population, including both adults and children. Among those not currently attending school at 
the time of the 1971 Census, 26.3 per cent had never attended school. The figures presented here in the table for later years do not include those still 
attending school.

(a) Changes in the Australian Bureau of Statistics Classification of Qualifications (ABSCQ) between 1986 and 1991 and the reclassification of some 
qualifications (for example nursing) from certificates to tertiary degrees mean that figures for the two categories of qualifications presented in the table for 
1991 are not directly comparable with earlier years. However, the ‘no qualification’ category can be directly compared with earlier years. (b) This 
category includes higher degrees, graduate diplomas and bachelor’s degrees. (c) This catgeory includes diplomas, trade and other certificates, qualifications 
not classified by level and those inadequately described.

there was some catching up to other Australians even though the share 
remained well below that of other Australians. 


The effect of the lower age on leaving school for indigenous Australians 
is apparent in the very high percentage with no qualifications (Table 1.2). 
Although the percentage with some qualification rose from 2.4 per cent in 
1971 to 9.3 per cent in 1991, the majority of indigenous people still had 
no educational qualification. This was also true for the non-indigenous 
population although to a lesser extent. Among non-indigenous Australians, 
the percentage with some educational qualification rose from 20.6 per 
cent in 1971 to 31.1 per cent in 1991. The ratios presented at the bottom 
of the table show that the growth in the share of tertiary graduates in the 
indigenous population was similar to that of other Australians but the 
share of those with certificates grew more rapidly than for other 
Australians. In 1991 the ratio of the shares of the indigenous and 
non-indigenous populations in this category was 0.38 compared with 0.12 
in 1971. The implications of the lower level of educational attainment for 
the economic status of indigenous Australians will be investigated more 
formally in chapters 2 and 3, but first a description of the labour force 
Status of indigenous Australians will be presented. 


Indigenous people in the Table 1.3 presents data on the labour force status of indigenous persons 

labour market compared with the Australian totals as reported in each of the censuses 
since 1971.° In each of the census years, indigenous Australians were less 
likely to be in employment than Australians in general and more likely to 
be unemployed and not in the labour force. Between 1971 and 1986 the 
share of indigenous people aged 15 years and over who were in 
employment, actually fell from 41.1 per cent to 31.3 per cent. This was 
followed by some improvement in the employment share which rose to 
37.1 per cent in 1991. Over the period there was a four-fold increase in 
the proportion of indigenous people who were unemployed, although the 
share fell from its peak of 17.1 per cent in 1986 to 16.5 per cent in 1991. 
The share of indigenous Australians who were classified as being not in 


3 Where possible, comparisons have been made between indigenous and other Australians 
(non-indigenous) but, where published sources are used, it has sometimes been necessary to 
compare indigenous people with Australian totals, that is including indigenous people. As 
indigenous people accounted for less than two per cent of the Australian population in each 
census year, the use of these total figures should not distort the findings.

the labour force fell between 1971 and 1991 but remained at almost half 
the population over 15 years of age. This was substantially higher than 
the share for non-indigenous Australians. 


Figure 1.1 presents a summary measure of the ratios of the share of 
indigenous people in each of the labour force categories divided by the 
share of all Australians in the same category. A ratio greater than one 
therefore implies that a larger proportion of indigenous people fell into 
that category than did Australians in general. There was some 
deterioration in the ratio for those in employment between 1971 and 1986 
followed by some improvement between 1986 and 1991. Although 
unemployment had increased substantially for indigenous Australians 
between 1971 and 1991, the increase in the share of the unemployed was 
even greater for Australians in general. The unemployed ratio fell over 
the twenty year period but the share of the indigenous population who 
were unemployed remained over twice that of the Australian population 
in general. The share of indigenous Australians who were not in the 
labour force remained consistently above that of Australians in general 
with little change in the ratio taking place. There were some important 
differences in the results for males and females which shall now be 
examined.

Perhaps the most dramatic feature of the results for males is the decline 
by a third in the percentage of indigenous males in employment from 
60.4 per cent in 1971 to 40.4 per cent in 1986. The proportion of males 
in employment in the total population also fell, but by a smaller 15 per 
cent from 79.1 per cent to 66.9 per cent. Between 1986 and 1991 there 
was a notable change in the trend of declining employment for 
indigenous males. In 1991 a larger percentage of indigenous males were 
in employment than in 1986. This was in contrast to the continuing 
decline in the percentage of total Australian males in employment. While 
a larger percentage of Australian males were unemployed in 1991 than in 
1986, the percentage of indigenous males who were unemployed as 
measured by the census actually fell slightly between the two censuses. 


Figure 1.2 presents a summary comparison of the different labour force 
status of indigenous Australians compared with all Australian males. The 
ratio of the share of males in employment was less than one for the 
whole period. While it declined between 1971 and 1986, there was some 
improvement between the last two census years. In 1971, the share of 
indigenous males who were unemployed was 5.4 times that of Australian 
males in general and while indigenous unemployment remained high, the 
Australian total increased even more dramatically. In 1991, the 
unemployment ratio for males fell to 2.3, although much of the

‘improvement’ in the relative position of indigenous males can be 
attributed to the deterioration in the position of Australian males in 
general. 


The result of a rising share for employment and a declining share for 
unemployment is perhaps surprising given the expected effects of the 
deteriorating macroeconomic conditions between 1986 and 1991 on the 
unemployment rate of a relatively disadvantaged group such as 
indigenous males. The turnaround in the employment trend for indigenous 
males probably reflects the positive employment impacts of the 
Aboriginal Employment Development Policy (AEDP) and in particular, 
the associated expansion of the Community Development Employment 
Projects (CDEP) scheme. Under this scheme, indigenous people can 
forego their individual welfare entitlements which are placed in a 
common pool, and work for a community on a part-time basis. The 
18,000 people working under this scheme in 1991 were, in principle, 
classified as employed in the census.’ The effects of the AEDP and 
CDEP on indigenous employment status will be a recurring theme of this 
monograph. 


The employment outcomes for females differed from that of males. The 
proportion of females in employment actually rose over the period 
1971-91. Indigenous females were, however, less likely to be in 
employment than were Australian females in general. The increase in 
employment was offset by a reduction in the proportion of females who 
considered themselves outside the labour force, but females appear to 
have also moved into unemployment. Unemployment among indigenous 
females rose from 1.9 per cent of the indigenous female population in 
1971 to 11.8 per cent in 1986 and remained at that level in 1991. There 
was also a substantial increase in unemployment over the same period 
among the total female population, from 0.8 per cent to 5.5 per cent. In 
contrast to the experience of indigenous females, unemployment grew 
between 1986 and 1991 for Australian females in general. 


The summary measure of labour force status for females is presented in 
Figure 1.3. They show smaller differences for indigenous females and the 
total female population than were found for indigenous males. While the 
share of indigenous females in employment remained at about half that of 
Australian females in total, the unemployed share was over twice as high. 


One issue of particular interest for this study is the manner in which 
people’s attachment to the labour force varies over the lifecycle (see 
chapters 4 and 5). Young people face problems associated with the 
transition from education to employment and adult status, while older 
workers are faced with the decision of when to retire and the effects of 
deteriorating health on the ability to participate in paid employment. It is 
therefore appropriate for the purposes of this study, to present 
employment data in a lifecycle context. As lifecycle effects differ 
markedly between males and females, Figures 1.4-1.7 present the 
employment/population ratios by age category for indigenous and other 
Australian males and females taken from each Census since 1976. 


* For fuller discussions of the CDEP scheme, see Sanders (1988), Altman and Sanders 
(1991b), Morony (1991) and Altman and Daly (1992a). Although CDEP scheme participants 
were not explicitly identified as such, evidence from the 1986 Census suggests that all 
CDEP scheme participants were not classified to the employed category (Altman and Daly: 
1992a). They appear to be included in all labour force categories. A particular effort was 
made by the ABS to have CDEP scheme participants classified as employed in the 1991 
Census. However, to the extent that this was unsuccessful, the figures presented in the text 
will overstate the share of CDEP scheme employment in total employment.

labour force status by age.

Among males in each age group, the percentage in employment was 
lower for indigenous males than in the total population (compare Figures 
1.4 and 1.5). The employment/population ratio for indigenous males was 
about 60 per cent of that of all Australian males and the decline in the 
ratio was particularly pronounced for indigenous males over 45 years of 
age. Another important result is the downward displacement of the 
profiles between 1976 and 1986 for both indigenous males and the 
Australian total with each age category having a lower 
employment/population ratio than the comparable age group in an earlier 
census. For Australian males in general, this trend of declining 
employment/population ratios appeared to have slowed down between 
1986 and 1991 when little change in the ratios was recorded. However, 
for indigenous males, there was a reversal of the pattern. Amongst all age 
categories, except those males over 65 years, the employment/population 
ratio was higher in 1991 than in 1986. This result once again, probably 
reflects the positive effects of the AEDP on employment status. 


The figures for both indigenous males and the Australian total show a 
lifecycle pattern of relatively low employment/population rates among 
young males aged 15-24, followed by a substantial increase in 
employment during the prime working ages, and a decline among older 
workers. While the increased share of those in employment took place at 
the same stage of the lifecycle for indigenous males and the Australian 
total, the timing of the decline in employment differed. Among the total 
Australian male population the decline in employment began in the 
55-59 age group, but among indigenous males, it began earlier, in the 
45-49 year old age group. 


The relationship between age and employment is very different for 
females than for males and it has been changing over time in different 
ways (compare Figures 1.6 and 1.7 with Figures 1.4 and 1.5). The typical 
lifecycle pattern of the employment/population ratio for females is 
roughly M-shaped. There is an initial rise with age in the proportion in 
employment as females complete their education and enter the workforce. 
This is followed by a decline during the child-bearing years and a second 
increase among older females with older children. The proportion in 
employment falls again as retirement age approaches. This pattern was in 
evidence among the total Australian female population (see Figure 1.6), 
but was far less pronounced for indigenous females (see Figure 1.7). The 


Variations in labour force 
status with settlement size. 


proportion of indigenous females leaving employment between the ages 
of 20-24 and 30-34 in 1976-86 was smaller than among the total female 
population. In fact, in 1991, there was no evidence of the M pattern with 
the employment/population ratio of indigenous females reaching its peak 
in the 35-44 age range. This is a surprising change in a widely observed 
pattern of lifecycle behaviour. It may reflect changing patterns of labour 
force participation between cohorts, so that younger indigenous females 
are more likely to be in employment than their older counterparts thus 
creating an unusual cross-sectional profile. If it can be attributed to the 
CDEP scheme, it suggests either that the scheme has had a very powerful 
effect in changing behaviour or that the inclusion among CDEP 
participants of such groups as sole parents who may be paid under the 
scheme for staying at home to look after their children, has created a 
misleading impression of the employment status of many indigenous 


. females. A more detailed investigation of this unusual lifecycle pattern is 


an important issue for further research. 


The employment/population ratio for indigenous females was much lower 
in each age category than for Australian females in general, usually less 
than half. There were, however, common trends in evidence with the 
proportion in employment among the 15-19 year olds declining between 
1976 and 1991 and the proportion in employment among 20-44 year olds 
increasing for both indigenous females and Australian females in general. 
They also shared a common pattem of declining employment among 
females over 50 years of age. 


In addition to the effects of the lifecycle, another important determinant 
of labour force status for indigenous people is settlement size (see Daly 
et al. 1993, Taylor 1993* and 1993°), Table 1.4 presents the labour force 
status of indigenous and other Australians according to the size of 
settlement in which they were enumerated in 1981 and 1991.° It is 
important to note the substantial differences in the distribution of 
indigenous people and other Australians across the three categories. Over 
two-thirds of indigenous people lived outside the major urban centres 
compared with about a third of the non-indigenous population. 


In 1991, indigenous males had a lower employment rate and a higher 
unemployment rate than other Australian males in each settlement 
category. There were however, differences between the categories. They 
were more likely to be in the labour force if they lived in a major urban 
centre than if they lived in a rural area. This contrasted with a small 
difference in the labour force participation rate of other Australian males 
in the three sections-of-State. The unemployment rate was highest for 
indigenous males in the major urban centres and for other Australian 
males in the other urban category. The relatively low rate of indigenous 
male unemployment in the rural areas is probably due to the existence 
there of CDEP scheme communities where participants in the scheme 
were to be classified as employed rather than unemployed for the 
purposes of the census (Taylor 1993°, 1993°). 


6 The comparison has been limited to 1981 and 1991 because of limitations in the 

availability of data. These categories are derived from the section-of State variable in the 
Census. The three settlement size categories used here are defined as follows: an urban 
centre is ‘one or more adjoining collection districts with urban characteristics and 
representing a population cluster of 1,000 or more people’ (ABS 1986: 150). Major urban 
centres had over 100,000 inhabitants and other urban areas between 1,000 and 99,999 
inhabitants. The rural category used here includes both ABS categories ‘rural locality’ and 
‘rural balance’. Localities include population clusters which can ‘be expected to contain at 
least 200 people (but not more than 999) by the next census; have at least 40 occupied 
non-farm dwellings with a discernible urban street pattern; have a discemible nucleus of 
population.” (ABS 1986: 97). The rural balance includes all the collection districts not 
included elsewhere (ABS 1986: 132). The definitions remained unchanged in 1991. 


10 


In each category, females were less likely to be in the labour force than 
were their male counterparts and indigenous females had a particularly 
low employment rate. In the major urban centres where the employment 
rate was highest for indigenous females, about a third were in 
employment compared with almost half of other Australian females. The 
unemployment rate was highest for Aboriginal females in the other urban 
centres and there is some evidence of a ‘CDEP scheme effect’ in 
reducing the unemployment rate of Aboriginal females in the rural areas. 


In comparison with 1981, there were some significant changes in the 
distribution of the indigenous population. The share of the indigenous 
population living in the major urban centres increased by 41 per cent and 
the share in rural areas decreased. Unemployment grew significantly, 
especially for the non-indigenous population in all sections-of-State. The 
one exception was the fall in the share of the indigenous population in 
other urban centres who were unemployed. The trend of increasing female 
participation in paid employment was apparent in each section-of-State.

In summary, the census evidence shows that indigenous people were, in 
general, less likely to be in employment and more likely to be 
unemployed or outside the labour force than were other Australians. A 
major feature of the comparison over time is the marked change between 
the employment trends for indigenous Australians in the periods 1971-86 
and 1986-91. Much of the improvement in the employment ratio for 
indigenous people in 1991 compared with earlier years is almost certainly 
attributable to the growing partivcipation in labour market programs under 
the AEDP, including the CDEP scheme. 


Industry and occupation of Not only were indigenous people less likely to be in employment than the 

employment rest of the population, but there were significant differences between 
indigenous and other Australians in their types of employment. The 
public sector played a more important role in indigenous employment 
over the period than it did for other Australians. While the share of 
indigenous people employed by the government rose by 11.9 per cent 
between 1976 and 1991, the share of total employment accounted for by 
government fell by 9.4 per cent among the Australian population in 
general. In 1991, 34.9 per cent of indigenous people in employment were 
working in the public sector compared with 22.3 per cent for the 
Australian population in general (see Table 1.5). 


Indigenous people are probably even more dependent on government for 
employment than these figures suggest. Many indigenous community 
organisations wholly funded by government, are included in the private 
sector category (Altman and Daly 1992b, Altman and Taylor 1994). 
Altman and Daly ( 1992°) have argued that this dependence on public 
sector employment has the negative implication that indigenous 
employment is very vulnerable to any changes in government policy. 


14 


However, it has probably helped to insulate indigenous people from the 
full effects of recessions. 


The importance of the public sector and other non-profit organisations is 
also apparent in the industry of employment data taken from the census 
(see Table 1.6). The industries with a large public sector component, 
gas, electricity and water; communications; public administration and 
community services had increased their share of indigenous employment 
to 46.4 per cent compared with 31.1 per cent in 1971 (a 49 per cent 
increase in the share). Over the same period, among non-indigenous 
Australians, the employment share of these industries had increased from 
19.8 per cent to 26.1 per cent (a 32 per cent increase in the share). These 
industries continued to increase their share in indigenous employment 
between 1986 and 1991 when they declined in importance amongst 
non-indigenous people.

In 1971 over half the indigenous people in employment were working in 
agriculture and community services, while three industries covered half of 
the non-indigenous employment (manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade 
and community services). These same three industries accounted for half 
the employment of other Australians in 1991, but public administration 
and wholesale and retail trade had replaced agriculture as major 
employers of indigenous people. The share of agriculture in indigenous 
employment declined to about a fifth of the 1971 level over the period. 
Community services, however, remained important throughout.

comparing the indigenous and the total population by sex.

The result that indigenous employment is particularly concentrated by 
industry is further emphasised by the findings of Taylor (1992°) based on 
a more disaggregated industry classification. Taylor (1992°) presents 
indices of industry segregation for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders 
which show that the employment of these groups is much more 
concentrated in particular industry classes within the broader industry 
divisions than for the population as a whole. Although there were 
differences in the distribution of the industry of employment between 
indigenous and other Australians, the simple correlation coefficient 
between the two was positive in 1991 (r = 0.65). Those industries which 
accounted for a large part of employment of non-indigenous people also 
accounted for a substantial share of indigenous employment. The changes 
in the industry shares of employment between 1971 and 1991 were also 
positively correlated (r = 0.53). Declines in the share of employment in 
agriculture, manufacturing and construction were in each case offset by 
increases in the share of employment in service industries. 


16 


Broadly similar results are apparent for each sex and are reported in 
Appendix tables A1.3 and A1.4. For indigenous males the sharp decline 
in agricultural employment and the growth of the share of employment in 
public administration were particularly in evidence. The correlation 
coefficient (r) between the shares of employment in each industry for 
indigenous and other Australian males did not change greatly between 
1971 and 1991. However, at this level of industry aggregation, the results 
show an increasing positive correlation between the distribution of 
employment for indigenous and other Australian females. 


Table 1.7 compares the occupational status of indigenous and 
non-indigenous people in employment. Changes in the occupational 
classification make it difficult to extend the comparison back in time 
before 1986 (Taylor 1992°). The table shows that indigenous people were 
much more likely to be employed in unskilled jobs particularly labouring 
jobs, than were Australians in general. In 1991, 29 per cent of indigenous 
people in employment worked in this category compared with 13.2 per 
cent of the total population. There was correspondingly, a much smaller 
proportion of indigenous people in management and professional 
positions, 4.9 per cent compared with 13.1 per cent in the general 
population. In 1991, there was a positive, but not very strong correlation 
between the distribution of employment by occupation for indigenous and 
other Australians (r = 0.27). There was also a positive correlation 

(r = 0.53) in the change in the distribution of occupations between 1986 
and 1991.

The incomes of indigenous 
people 


17 


A comparison of the occupational distribution for each sex is presented in 
Appendix tables A1.5 and A1.6. Indigenous males were much less likely 
to be employed in managerial or professional occupations and were much 
more likely to be employed in the unskilled occupations of plant and 
machinery operators and drivers and labourers than were other Australian 
males. The correlation between the occupational distribution of indigenous 
and non-indigenous males was much lower than for females. Although 
indigenous females were relatively under-represented in the more skilled 
occupational groups, the differences were not nearly as pronounced as for 
males. 


Despite some improvement in the ratio of indigenous/non-indigenous 
median incomes between 1976 and 1991, the indigenous income remained 
considerably lower. In 1991, real median indigenous income was 63 per 
cent of that of other Australians. Those in employment had lower 
incomes and those unemployed and not in the labour force had incomes 
similar to other Australians in these categories. This pattern was repeated 
in each of the earlier years. 


The decline in the employment ratio of indigenous males and the 
relatively low employment rate of indigenous females might be expected 
to have serious implications for the average income of indigenous people. 
Table 1.8 presents data on the changes in indigenous income over time 
for people of working age. As columns 1 and 2 show, the real median ~ 
income of non-indigenous males remained constant over the period 
1976-91 but there was a substantial decline for indigenous males. In 
1991, the median income of indigenous males was 29 per cent lower in 
real terms than it had been in 1976. This change reflects the deterioration 
in the employment rate of indigenous males. The ratio of the median 
income of indigenous males compared with other Australian males fell by 
19 percentage points between 1976 and 1991. The largest change in the 
ratio occurred between 1976 and 1981. 


The largest income differences between indigenous and other Australian 
males were among the employed. Indigenous males in employment had a 
median income which was 70 per cent of other employed Australian 
males in 1991. For the unemployed and those outside the labour market, 
indigenous males had on average, the same or higher incomes in each of 
the census years until 1991. In that year, the ratio for the unemployed 
and those outside the labour force was lower than in the earlier censuses. 


Although the average income of females remained below that of males, 
there was some growth in female incomes over the period. In contrast to 
the position of indigenous males that of indigenous females actually 
improved. The median income of indigenous females was 78 per cent 
higher in 1991 than it had been in 1976. Indigenous females who were 
not in employment had average incomes well in excess of the average for 
non-indigenous females in these categories. The improvement in the 
income status of indigenous females can probably be explained by the 
extension of the welfare system to cover many more indigenous people in 
remote areas (Altman and Sanders 1991°, Daly and Hawke 1994°).

Summary 


In summary, census data show that indigenous people were less likely to 
be in employment than the Australian population and that those in 
employment were more likely to be working for the public sector or 
some other non-profit organisation. The decline in indigenous male 
employment over the period was reflected in the decline in male income. 
In contrast, indigenous females had higher real incomes in 1991 

compared with 1976. This improvement, however, probably arose because 
of increased access to welfare benefits and as such should not be taken as 
a signal of a lasting improvement in the relative economic status of 
indigenous females (Daly and Hawke 1994). 


The improvement in indigenous employment status between 1986 and 
1991 is almost certainly attributable to the inclusion of CDEP workers 
among the employed. Whether some participants in the CDEP scheme 
can be really thought of as employed as the term is usually understood, is 
an important issue. The results presented here suggest that the inclusion 
of CDEP scheme participants among the employed has distorted the 
picture of indigenous employment status and suggests the need for a 
separate category of labour force status for CDEP scheme participants and 
participants in other labour market programs. 


Among those in employment, census data show that indigenous people 
were more likely to be in the public sector and in unskilled occupations 
than were other Australians. There is some evidence of change in the 
industry distribution of employment over the 1971-91 period for 
indigenous people which is correlated with changes for other Australians. 
In common with other Australians, census data show a decline in the 
share of employment in the government sector between 1986 and 1991. 
This result should not be taken as evidence of a reduction in the role of 


government funding in providing employment for indigenous people. It 


may reflect a growth in employment in indigenous community 


organisations which are classified as outside the public sector, but remain 
publicly funded. With respect to occupation, there was some movement in 
employment away from unskilled to more highly skilled occupations.

CHAPTER 2 


THE DETERMINANTS OF INDIGENOUS LABOUR FORCE STATUS 


The determinants of labour 
force status 


Labour force status, that is whether a person is employed, unemployed or 
outside the labour force, is an important indicator of economic wellbeing. 
Without income from employment, individuals become dependent on 
transfers from other sources, for example within the family or from the 
state, and it is the high level of unemployment among indigenous people 
with its associated dependence on income from the Federal government 
which has been of particular concern to policy makers. 


This concern has been addressed in the formulation of the Aboriginal 
Employment Development Policy (AEDP) in 1987 and restated in the 
1994 review of that policy — 


The recommendations made in the Review are directed at 
increasing the quantity and quality of employment outcomes for 
indigenous people. (ATSIC (1994) p xvi) 


In the light of this interest in employment, the purpose of this chapter is 
to consider the determinants of labour force status for indigenous 
Australians. A multinomial logit model will be used to consider the 
question, what are the main factors which determine whether a person is 
employed full or part-time, unemployed or not in the labour force? (For a 
full presentation of a formal model of the labour supply decision, see 
Killingsworth (1983)). Four possible outcomes have been identified; 
full-time employment (35 or more hours of work per week), part-time 
employment (1-34 hours a week), unemployment and ‘not in the labour 
force’ (NILF). 


There is an extensive literature which aims to explain differences in 
labour force status and income according to racial group and sex.) A 
framework which is frequently adopted, and will be used here and in the 
following chapter, is the human capital model. This model treats activities 
such as education, on-the-job training, migration and health care as forms 
of investment which raise productivity and therefore earnings. The 
individual’s problem is to maximise lifetime earnings, given the costs and 
benefits associated with any investment in human capital. In this 
framework, the lower levels of education and working experience are 
important determinants of the lower income of employed indigenous 
people (for fuller treatments of the theory see Becker 1975 and Elliott 
1991). 


Time spent in education can be seen as an investment in skills which 
raise the probability of employment and increase income, as more highly 
educated people are likely to be more productive and therefore have 
higher earnings. Even if education in itself does not directly raise 
productivity, where educational qualifications are taken as a signal of 
competence and motivation to work, it may be worthwhile for individuals 
to acquire these qualifications as an entry requirement to employment. 
On-the-job training is one method by which individuals can acquire 
productivity-enhancing skills outside a formal classroom environment. As 
it is difficult to find data on the money or time spent in on-the-job 


| For surveys of this literature see Ehrenberg and Smith (1987), Hammermesh and Rees 
(1993) and Siebert (1985). 


26 


training, the extent of this form of investment has been approximated by 
a measure of working experience (Mincer 1974). The preferred measure 
of actual time spent in employment is rarely available, and, therefore, a 
measure of potential experience (actual age less the age on leaving 
education), is frequently used. The human capital model predicts that 
most investment in productivity-enhancing skills will be undertaken by 
young people. Among older workers, income may actually decline with 
additional years in the workforce, as investment in new skills ceases and 
existing skills deteriorate and become obsolete. This model will form the 
basis of the statistical results reported here. 


The independent variables chosen for modelling labour force status were 
determined by economic relevance and availability in the 1991 Census. 
These variables fell into four broad areas; ethnicity, family characteristics, 
educational attainment and location of residence. (See Appendix 2A for 
full details of the variables.) 


An important question for this study is whether Aboriginality in itself has 
an effect on labour force status or whether the lower employment rates of 
indigenous people merely reflect their smaller stock of labour market 
skills. Any independent effect of Aboriginality on labour force status may 
reflect factors on either the supply or demand sides of the labour market. 
Indigenous people who were identical in every other measured respect to 
comparable non-indigenous people may choose a different labour force 
Status. Alternatively, factors on the demand-side of the labour market, for 
example discrimination in employment, may frustrate indigenous people 
in their attempts to achieve the labour force status which is most common 
among other Australians with the same set of measured characteristics. 
The results presented here will not however, enable a distinction between 
the sources of any ‘indigenous effect’ on labour force status. 


The choice of other variables used in the analysis has taken into account 
the factors which human capital theory suggests should be important in 
determining labour force status and the results of earlier studies of 
indigenous employment and unemployment (see Miller 1987, 1989, 1991, 
Ross 1991, Jones 1990, 1991, Daly 1993* and Daly et. al. 1993). These 
studies have emphasised the role of education, labour force experience 
and location of residence in explaining indigenous employment and 
unemployment. 


Education has been included in two forms; the age on leaving school and 
the level of qualification. Additional education is expected to raise the 
probability of employment (and therefore reduce the probability of being 
unemployed or not in the labour force). Four educational qualification 
groups have been distinguished: those who have no post secondary 
qualification (unqualified); those who held a certificate such as a trade 
certificate (cert); those who had completed a graduate diploma (dip); and 
finally, those who have completed a university degree at a bachelor or 
higher level (degree). 


Additional working experience is also predicted to have a positive effect 
on the probability of employment through most of working life. Age 
captures not only these effects of labour market experience on labour 
force status but also broader lifecycle effects. This variable has the further 
advantage of being truly exogenous, that is determined independently of 
the things that are being modelled. Following Daly et al (1993), an age 
squared term was also added to capture non-linearities in the relationship 
between age and labour force status. 


The statistical model 


27 


An additional measure of skill which has been included in this analysis is 
the ability to communicate in English. Other studies (Jones 1990, 1991; 
Daly 1993, Daly et al 1993) have found that poor English skills reduced 
the probability of being in employment. 


Many studies of the determinants of labour force status and income have 
included family characteristics as important control variables (Hill 1979). 
An individual’s marital status is likely to effect their range of 
employment opportunities and their motivation. The effects will differ 
between the sexes where family responsibilities are allocated according to 
conventional patterns. It is expected that as the number of dependent 
children increases, this will have a positive effect on the probability of 
females being not in the labour force. The predicted sign for males is not 
so clear. Additional children may encourage greater search effort to find 
employment or by raising welfare entitlement, may reduce the incentives 
to find employment. 


Location has been shown to be an important determinant of labour force 
status for indigenous people (Tesfaghiorghis 1991*, 1991°, Daly 1993", 
Daly et al 1993, Taylor 1993") and is measured here by the 
section-of-State variable used by the ABS which divides Australia into 
three categories according to settlement size. 


A random sample of 1991 Census data was used for the analysis. The 
data consisted of 23,477 indigenous and 22,342 non-indigenous people. 
Indigenous people were therefore over-represented and the sample should 
not be taken as representative of the Australian population as a whole. 


As the dependent variable was not continuous, ordinary linear regression 
is inappropriate and it was necessary to use a technique appropriate for a 
dependent variable with only four possible values. Multinomial logit 
regression was chosen as the four possible outcomes needed to be treated 
as categorical, rather than ordinal. The inclusion of the not in the labour 
force category meant that the outcomes could not be ordered by the 
number of hours worked. 


Logistic regression can be best explained in the case where the dependent 
variable has two possible values. For example: 


— Employed 
— Not Employed 


In this case the following would be modelled:- 
P = no. of people employed/ relevant sub-population 


However this lies between 0 and 1 and still not between the required 
-infinity and +infinity. To overcome this problem, a logit transformation 
is applied. 


logit P = log (P/(1-P)) 


This is also known as the log odds. Logit P becomes the dependent 
variable and the modelling performed is known as logistic regression. 
However, there are four possible values for the dependent variable in this 
example so the model is extended to multinomial logistic regression. Here 
a similar proportion is used, that is, 


The results 


28 


Pj = no. of people in labour force category i / relevant 
sub-population, where i takes on one of four values: 

Pi = proportion of people not in the labour force 

P2 = proportion of people employed full-time 

P3 = proportion of people employed part-time 

P4 = proportion of people unemployed 


The logit transformation becomes:- 


logit Pj = log (Pi/P4) 
where P4 = 1 - (Pi + P2 + P3) 


The model then becomes:- 
logit Pj) = bo + b1X1 + b2X2 + ....4 ef 


where bj; are the coefficients, Xj the variables and ei, the error term which 
approximates a multivariate normal distribution (see Hosmer and 
Lemeshow (1989) and Agresti (1984) for fuller discussions). 


Variables were added to the model sequentially in order of importance 
(forward model selection) until the addition of further variables did not 
greatly improve the model. Interactions, when the effect of one variable is 
different depending on the level of another variable, were also included 
for the relationships between Aboriginality and education qualification 
and Aboriginality and location of residence. The estimation was done 
using the procedure Proc Catmod in the computer package SAS. 


The coefficients in logistic regression models measure relative 
probabilities and as such are difficult to immediately interpret. However, 
the regression coefficients can be used to calculate the probabilities of 
people being in a particular labour force category given their 
characteristics. The impact on labour force status of changes in the 
independent variables is presented in Table 2.1 for males and Table 2.2 
for females (the regression results are reported in Appendix Tables A2.1 
and A2.2), 


> ‘The coefficients for a particular labour force category (see Appendix tables A2.1 and A2.2) 
are a function of the probability of being in that category divided by the probability of being 
unemployed. The interpretation of coefficients of different variables is described the 
following (totally synthetic) example: 

Suppose, when investigating the effect of having a trade diploma on Labour Force Status, 
the following coefficients are predicted: 


Labour Force Category Intercept Trade Diploma 
Full-time employment -0.3 0.7 
NILF 0.5 -0.2 
Part-time employment -0.9 0.4 


Then, in the absence of a diploma, the model predicts that 
log( PFT / PU/E ) = -0.3 - 0.7 = -1.0 

ie, PFT / PU/E = exp(-1.0) 1 

so, PFT PU/, 


where FT stands for full-time employment and U/E stands for unemployed. 
However, if a diploma is present, 


log( Perr / Pug) = -0.3 + 0.7 = 0.4 

ie, Prr Pum = exp(0.4) 1 

so, Prr Pug 

In other words, the positive coefficient of having a diploma associated with full-time 
employment illustrates that having a trade diploma increases the probability of being in a 
particular labour force category relative to the probability of being unemployed. When there 
is more than one explanatory variable, and particularly when there are interactions, the 
situation becomes more complicated, though the same general principle holds. 


29 


A control person has been established for each sex with the following 
characteristics; a non-indigenous person aged 30 years who left school at 
the age of 15 or 16, with no post secondary qualifications, good English 
speaking ability, was single with no dependent children, and living in a 
major urban area. The estimated equation predicted a 0.63 probability of 
such a male being in fuli-time employment, 0.21 probability of being in 
part-time employment, 0.06 probability of being unemployed and 0.10 of 
being outside the labour force (see Table 2.1). For females with these 
characteristics there was a lower probability of being in full-time 
employment or unemployed and a higher probability of being in part-time 
employment than was predicted for males (see Table 2.2). The remainder 
of these tables shows the effects of changes in each of the independent 
variables taken separately on the predicted probability of the control 
person falling in each of the four categories. The results for males and 
females will now be considered in turn.

(a) The control man was a non-indigenous man aged 30 years who left school at the age of 15 or 16, had no qualifications, good English ability, was 
single with no dependants and lived in a major urban area. (b) All the same characteristics as the non-indigenous control male except he is indigenous. 


A major result is the very large changes in labour force status which is 
predicted if the control male were indigenous rather than non-indigenous. 
An indigenous male with all the other characteristics of the control man 
was much less likely to be in full-time employment than a 
non-indigenous male; the probability was 0.36 compared with 0.63 for the 
non-indigenous control man. The probability of being unemployed 
increased from 0.06 for a non-indigenous male to 0.29 for an indigenous 
male and he was also more likely to be outside the labour force. 


30 


Educational attainment also had a substantial impact on labour force 
status. Those males who had no schooling or had left school before the 
age of 15 years were less likely to be in full-time employment and more 
likely to be outside the labour force than those who had left school aged 
15-16 years. Staying at school until the age of 17 or more years 
increased the probability of being in full-time employment. Males with a 
post secondary qualification were more likely to be in full-time 
employment than those without. This effect was particularly pronounced 
for indigenous males with a university degree; the probability of these 
males being in full-time employment was 0.21 higher than for an 
indigenous male with no qualifications. Poor English speaking ability had 
a strong negative effect on the probability of being in full-time 
employment and a positive effect on the probability of being outside the 
labour force compared with the control man. 


The largest estimated effect of family characteristics on the labour force 
status of males was for married compared with single males. It was 
estimated that married males were more likely to be in full-time 
employment than single males. The number of dependent children had 
little effect on labour force status, except for those with four or more 
dependent children who were predicted to be less likely to be in full-time 
employment. 


Location of residence did not have a large effect on labour force status 
for non-indigenous males but it was estimated to have a substantial effect 
for indigenous males. Indigenous males who lived in the other urban 
centres were more likely to be unemployed than their counterparts in the 
major urban centres. However, those living in rural areas were almost 
twice as likely to be in part-time employment and less likely to be 
unemployed than those in the major urban areas. The most probable 
explanation of this result is the growth in part-time CDEP employment 
which has taken place in rural areas. The result suggests that holding 
everything else constant an indigenous male could increase the probability 
of being in employment as measured by the census by moving to a rural 
area. 


The effect of Aboriginality on labour force status was similar for males 
and females. An indigenous female with all the other characteristics of 
the control woman was less than half as likely to be in full-time 
employment.

(a) The control woman was a non-indigenous woman aged 30 years who left school at the age of 15 or 16, had no qualifications, good English ability, 
was single with no dependants and lived in a major urban area. (b) All the same characteristics as the non-indigenous control female except she is 


indigenous. 


She was less likely to be in part-time employment and more likely to be 
unemployed or not in the labour force. 


Higher levels of educational attainment as measured by both age on 
leaving school and qualifications were associated with a higher 
probability of being in full-time employment This effect was particularly 
pronounced for indigenous females with diplomas and degrees. The 
probability of being in full-time employment was estimated to be 0.73 for 
an indigenous female with a degree compared with 0.25 for one without a 
qualification. Poor English speaking ability had a negative effect on the 
probability of being in full-time employment for all females. 


Family characteristics had different effects on female labour force status 
than for males. Married and widowed, separated and divorced females 
were more likely to be in part-time employment than were single females. 
The presence of dependent children also increased the probability of 
being in part-time employment or not in the labour force. The more 
children, the less likely females were to be in full-time employment. 


Location of residence was predicted to have a larger effect on the labour 
force status of non-indigenous females than it had on males. 
Non-indigenous females living in rural areas were less likely to be in 
part-time employment and more likely to be not in the labour force than 
their counterparts living in major urban centres. However, the effect of 
location of residence was particularly strong for indigenous females. 
Indigenous females living in other urban centres were less likely to be

unemployed than those living in major urban centres. In common with 
indigenous males, indigenous females living in rural Australia were more 
likely to be in part-time employment and less likely to be unemployed 
than their counterparts in the major urban centres. Once again these 
differences are probably a result of the operation of the CDEP scheme. 


Figures 2.1-2.4 compare in graphical form, the different effects of 
qualifications and location of residence on the labour force status of 
Aboriginal people and other Australians A negative value indicates that 
the probability of being in the relevant labour force category was less for 
an Aboriginal person with the characteristic of interest (for example 
having a university degree) than for a non-Aboriginal person with the 
same characteristic. A positive value means that the probability of being 
in the particular labour force category was greater for an Aboriginal 
person with the characteristic of interest than for non-Aborigines with the 
same characteristic. 


Figures 2.1 and 2.2 present the differences for males and females 
respectively, in the probability of being in each labour force category 
according to the level of qualification held. Figure 2.1 shows that the 
addition of qualification level did not change the general result that 
Aboriginal males were less likely to be in full-time employment (apparent 
in the negative values for each qualification level) and more likely to be 
unemployed or outside the labour force than were non-Aboriginal males 
(see the positive values for each qualification level). However, the 
differences between indigenous and non-indigenous males in the predicted 
probabilities were smaller for those with degrees and larger for those with 
certificates than for those with no qualifications. 


The differences reported in Figure 2.2 for females show that higher 
educational qualifications had a particularly strong positive effect on the 
probability of indigenous females being in full-time employment and 
reduced the probability of them being unemployed or outside the labour 
force. In particular, indigenous females with degrees had a higher 
probability of being in full-time employment and a lower probability of 
being not in the labour force than their non-indigenous counterparts. 


Figures 2.3 and 2.4 illustrate the effect of section-of-State of residence on 
the labour force status of indigenous males and females relative to other 
Australians. Indigenous people who lived in the other urban 
section-of-State were relatively worse off in terms of higher 
unemployment compared to non-indigenous people living in these 
locations. These results held for both males and females. The only 
employment category in which a higher probability was predicted for 
indigenous than non-indigenous people was in part-time employment in 
rural areas but this difference was very small. 


Over the period 1971-91, indigenous people were less likely to be 
employed and more likely to be unemployed or outside the labour force 
than were other Australians. The purpose of this chapter has been to 
examine some of these differences in a formal regression framework. 


Perhaps the most striking result is the effect of Aboriginality in itself on 
labour force status. For both males and females, holding everything else 
constant, Aboriginality substantially decreased the probability of being in 
full or part-time employment and increased the probability of being 
unemployed or not in the labour force. This result could reflect either 
demand or supply side preferences for employment of indigenous people. 


33 


In general, additional education increased the probability of being in 
employment. For indigenous people, particularly females, a university 
degree increased the probability of being in full-time employment. The 
effect of university qualifications was even greater for indigenous 
compared with non-indigenous females. The results suggest that 
increasing the educational attainment of indigenous Australians could 
make an important contribution towards improving their employment 
Status. 


Demographic variables such as marital status and the number of 
dependent children had different effects on the labour force status of 
males and females. While males who had never been married were less 
likely to be in full-time employment, females who had never been 
married were more likely to be in full-time employment. Except for those 
males with four or more children, the number of dependent children did 
not greatly influence labour force status but more children were 
associated with less full-time employment for females.

A third important influence on labour force status for indigenous but less 
so for non-indigenous Australians, was the location of residence. Both 
indigenous males and females were more likely to be in part-time 
employment and less likely to be unemployed if they lived in a rural 
rather than a major urban area. This result probably reflects the 
concentration of CDEP employment in rural areas. 


35 


As already noted, it was the ABS intention that people working under the 
CDEP scheme should be classified as employed in the 1991 Census. The 
usual determinants of labour force status (for example educational 
attainment and labour force experience) are however, not relevant to 
inclusion in the scheme, rather Aboriginality is the selection criteria. It 
might be expected that this would be reflected in the results presented 
here, that is the expansion of the scheme would reduce the negative 
effects of Aboriginality on the probability of being in employment. The 
results suggest that the scale of participation in the CDEP scheme in 
1991 was not sufficient to change the overall direction of the effect of 
Aboriginality on employment status; holding other measured variables 
constant, Aboriginality continued to have a negative effect on the 
probability of being in both full and part-time employment. However, in 
rural Australia where the CDEP scheme has the largest number of 
participants, the probability of an indigenous person being in part-time 
employment, holding everything else constant, was slightly higher than 
for non-indigenous people. It would appear that, at least in rural areas, 
the CDEP scheme has made some contribution to reducing the negative 
effect of Aboriginality on the probability of being in employment as 
defined by the census, although this effect has been on part-time 
employment rather than full-time employment.

CHAPTER 3 


DETERMINANTS OF EMPLOYMENT INCOME FOR INDIGENOUS 
AUSTRALIANS 


The results of the preceding chapter highlighted the importance of 
Aboriginality in itself in determining labour force status. This chapter 
focuses on the relatively affluent group of indigenous Australians who 
were employed full time and considers the effects of their Aboriginality 
on their employment income. Although their incomes were high by 
indigenous standards, the average income of employed indigenous 
Australians was below that of the rest of the Australian population. In 
1991, the median employed (including full-time and part-time) indigenous 
male had an income of 70 per cent that of an employed non-indigenous 
male, and, for the median indigenous female, 83 per cent that of an 
employed non-indigenous female (see Table 1.8). 


The human capital model, outlined in the preceding chapter, will form the 
basis for the statistical analysis reported here. However, even with the 
same levels of education and working experience, indigenous people may 
be paid less than their non-indigenous counterpats. In other words, they 
may not receive the same financial rewards for investment in human 
capital as non-indigenous people. This may arise through discrimination 
against indigenous Australians in the labour market so that otherwise 
identical indigenous people are paid less than non-indigenous people. 
Alternatively, it may reflect decisions by indigenous Australians not to 
maximise their money incomes but rather to place greater emphasis on 
non-pecuniary benefits. An example of this would be a nursing aide who 
chose to work for a lower salary in a familiar indigenous community 
rather than seek promotion involving a move to the city. 


There are many other reasons why income may differ between 
individuals, such as inherited abilities, motivation and good luck. Another 
factor is the nature of the work; and the theory of compensating 
differentials formally takes this factor into account.! According to this 
theory, workers require additional monetary incentives to take on 
dangerous or unpleasant work or to move to undesirable locations. 


Studies of the income status of employed North American Indians (both 
Canadian and American) based on the human capital model have found 
contrasting results. Sandefur and Scott’s (1983) study of Native 
Americans concluded that differences in measured characteristics, that is 
the endowments of human capital, were the major sources of income 
differences between Native Americans and Whites. In contrast, Patrinos 
and Sakellariou’s (1992) study of Canadian data found that more than 
half the income difference was not explained by differences in 
endowments of human capital. The results presented here will provide an 
additional observation on the determinants of income status for 
indigenous people in another part of the world. 


' The theory was originally expounded by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations. For a 
more modem treatment see Rosen (1986). For other surveys of the determinants of pay see 
Ehrenberg and Smith (1987), Siebert (1985), Elliott (1991) and Hamermesh and Rees (1993). 
For recent surveys of the discrimination literature see Blau and Ferber (1987) and 
Gunderson (1989), 


The model 


40 


The earnings equations to be estimated here include variables suggested 
by the human capital model and are similar to those used to explain 
labour force status in Chapter 2. Each equation can be thought of as an 
‘hedonic price function which reflects the equilibrium of the supply and 
demand for workers at each level of schooling and experience’ (Willis 
1986: 529). The earnings function will be estimated in semi-log form 
following Mincer (1974). The basic equation to be estimated for 
indigenous and non-indigenous males and females is the following: 


Gross weekly income = f(education, experience, family 
characteristics, location of residence, English-speaking ability, 
Aboriginality). (1) 


A detailed description of the variables is included in Appendix 3A. 


Aboriginality has been included here, as a central question is whether 
employed indigenous Australians have lower average incomes because 
they have less of the skills valued in the labour market or because of 
some particular characteristics associated with indigenous people in 
employment. 


Education and experience are included as central variables in the human 
capital model. Education has been included in two forms: one variable 
which measures the years spent at primary and secondary school; and a 
second group of variables relating to educational qualifications. The 
coefficient on the years-of-schooling variable shows the percentage 
increase in income with each additional year of primary and secondary 
schooling. This enables an estimation of the effect of additional schooling 
on the income of those who did not have any educational qualifications. 
The four education groups outlined in Chapter 2 have been included to 
measure the additional effect of a post schooling qualification on income. 


Experience in the workforce is predicted to have a positive effect on 
income. It is measured in two forms, the first being potential experience 
(current age minus estimated years of full-time education minus 5) and 
the second an adjusted measure of experience. As already discussed in 
Chapter 2, a preferred measure of the variable of real interest, investment 
in on-the-job training, is the time actually spent in employment, but this 
is unavailable in the census. If actual experience in employment and in 
on-the-job training is substantially less than an individual’s potential 
experience, the estimated impact of experience on income will be 
understated. This difference between potential and actual experience is 
important for particular groups, such as those who characteristically have 
an intermittent attachment to the labour force. For the purposes of this 
study, potential experience may be a particularly inappropriate measure of 
the labour market experience of indigenous people. The unemployment 
rate is much higher than for the rest of the population and there is case 
study evidence to suggest that indigenous people are more likely to be 
employed in casual and seasonal work (Smith 1991). For these reasons 
potential experience is likely to overestimate the actual labour market 
experience of these people. 


The options for adjusting the census measure of potential experience to 
take into account differences in individuals’ attachment to the labour 
force are limited. The approach adopted here has been to use census data 
on the employment/population ratio at each age to create an estimate of 
adjusted labour market experience. So for example, if half of indigenous 
males aged 24 years were in employment, indigenous males of this age in 


The data 


41 


full-time employment were given half a year of adjusted labour force 
experience. An individual’s labour force experience was then calculated as 
the sum of experience at each age up to their current age with appropriate 
adjustments for the time spent in schooling. This estimate therefore is an 
average of employment experience at each age and takes into account 
both full- and part-time employment. If those in full-time employment 
have greater attachment to the labour force than the rest of the 
population, this estimate will understate the true extent of their labour 
force experience. Measures of adjusted experience have been calculated 
separately for four groups; each sex of both indigenous and 
non-indigenous Australians. 


Ability to communicate in English has been included as another 
component of an individual’s human capital. As already noted, it has 
been found to be an important determinant of employment status and 
income. Jones (1990) found that speaking a language other than English 
was correlated with lower incomes for indigenous Australians. 


Marital status and the number of dependents have been included once 
again as control variables and are expected to have different effects on 
employment income for males and females.” Marriage and dependent 
children are expected to have a negative effect on female incomes where 
these restrict choice of employment. 


Location of residence has been shown to be an important determinant of 
income from employment for both the indigenous and non-indigenous 
populations. As in Chapter 2, the section-of-State variable which relates 
to settlement size has been used here. The coefficient on these locational 
variables can be seen as measuring the size of the compensating 
differential required to encourage people to live in particular places. Any 
difference between the size of the differential for indigenous and 
non-indigenous people suggests that they value location of residence 
differently. 


The data to be used in this analysis come from a randomly selected 
sample of indigenous and non-indigenous people of working age, taken 
from the 1991 Population Census. It consists of 5,621 indigenous 
Australians and 10,534 non-indigenous Australians working full time, 
35 or more hours per week. 


The census has a number of shortcomings for the purpose of this 
analysis. The preferred measure of income from employment is hourly 
earnings. However, since 1976, the census has not included a question 
about sources of income. Consequently, there is no direct information on 
any individual’s earnings from employment. Nor did the census seek 
detailed information on the number of hours worked each week, but it 
included broad categories of hours worked. This makes it very difficult to 
estimate hourly income where the categories cover a broad range of hours 
(for example 1-15 hours of work per week). In an attempt to reduce the 
problems associated with these two sources of measurement error in the 
dependent variable, the estimation presented here has been restricted to 
full-time workers (those working between 35 or more hours per week). 


2 Other studies which include marital status are Gregory et al. (1989) and Chapman and 
Mulvey (1986) for Australia and Sandefur and Scott (1983) and Patrinos and Sakellariou 
(1992) for North America. Hill (1979) presents a survey of American evidence and a 
discussion of the reasons for including marital status in earings regressions. 


42 


The Income and Housing Survey conducted by the ABS in 1985-86 
showed that 85 per cent of the income of those employed full-time came 
from employment. Thus, the census income figures for this group are 
probably an adequate indicator of earnings.

As already noted, the census question relates to current employment 
status. This means that a certain proportion of those currently in full-time 
employment may not have been in such employment for the year over 
which their income has been measured, and that their actual working 
experience may differ substantially from their potential experience. 


Table 3.1 presents the average characteristics of full-time workers in the 
samples. On average, the indigenous males in the sample had lower levels 
of education and experience. According to the adjusted measure of 
experience, indigenous males had less than half the labour force 
experience of non-indigenous males. Indigenous males were less likely to 
be legally married and had more dependent children than non-indigenous 
males. They were more likely to live outside the major urban centres; 
two-thirds of indigenous males lived in other urban or rural locations 
compared with 36 per cent of non-indigenous males. 


Many of these differences applied also to females. Indigenous females 
had less education in terms of qualifications than non-indigenous females 
although the difference in the number of years of primary and secondary 
schooling was smaller for females than for males. Indigenous females had 
less potential labour market experience than non-indigenous females and 
given their much lower rate of employment, had less than half the 
adjusted labour market experience of non-indigenous females. They were 
less likely to be legally married and had more dependent children. 
Indigenous females, as with indigenous males, worked in different 
locations to their non-indigenous counterparts. Over half of the indigenous 
females working full time lived outside major urban areas compared with 
31 per cent of non-indigenous females. 


The regression results for equation (1) are reported in Table 3.2 for 
indigenous and non-indigenous males and females. The constant term in 
these equations relates to an unqualified urban dweller who is single, has 


43 


no dependants, no qualifications or years of schooling, no labour market 
experience, is fluent in English and is not an indigenous Australian. The 
results for males and females will be considered in turn and will focus on 
the preferred equations; (2) for males and (4) for females. The preferred 
equations were determined by deleting all the indigenous interaction terms 
which were highly insignificant, those with ‘t’ statistics of less than one. 
In these cases there was no evidence of a statistically significant different 
relationship between income and the independent variable for indigenous 
and non-indigenous Australians. For example, the results do not suggest 
that the effect of marriage on income differs for indigenous compared 
with non-indigenous males. 


The estimated equations show some fairly standard results. Income 
increased with the level of education. Male university graduates earned 
49 per cent more than their unqualified counterparts and female graduates 
42 per cent more. Additional labour market experience also raised income 
for the first 33 years of potential experience for males and 31 years for 
females. Both males and females who lived outside the major urban 
centres had lower incomes, other things being equal. Married males had 
higher incomes than their single counterparts but a statistically significant 
effect was not found for females. There was a negative effect on income 
for both males and females of dependent children, perhaps because the 
number of dependent children is associated with other socio-economic 
characteristics. Poor English language skills also had a depressed effect 
on income. 

The results reported in Table 3.2 column 2 for males show a significant 
negative effect of Aboriginality on the income of males working full 
time. According to these estimates, holding everything else constant, 
indigenous males could expect to have incomes which were 9 per cent 
below those of their non-indigenous counterparts. This difference may 
reflect discrimination against indigenous males, or their choice of 
employment with smaller monetary compensation offset by non-pecuniary 
benefits (for example, working in an indigenous organisation). It does, 
however, suggest that indigenous males suffer from an income 
disadvantage associated with their race. A similar result of a ‘Native 
American’ effect on income was found by Sandefur and Scott (1983).

There was only evidence of statistically significant differences between 
indigenous and other Australians in the returns to human capital 
characteristics for a restricted number of these characteristics. The income 
of indigenous males who held a certificate qualification was 15 per cent 
higher than an unqualified indigenous male compared with the gap of 

10 per cent for non-indigenous males. Indigenous males however, 
received a smaller return for a diploma than non-indigenous males. Living 
in a rural location had a particularly strong negative effect on indigenous 
incomes. Where non-indigenous males who lived in a rural area received 
18 per cent less income, other things being equal, than their counterparts 
in the major urban areas. Indigenous males were estimated to receive 

29 per cent less income. 


The measured effect of Aboriginality on the incomes of females was 
smaller than for males. Indigenous women were estimated to receive 

4 per cent less income than non-indigenous women, holding everything 
else constant. There was some evidence of a higher return to university 
degrees for indigenous females compared with non-indigenous females 
and living in a rural location had a particularly strong negative effect on 
income. 


Additional regression results are reported in Appendix Table 3A.1 using 
the alternative adjusted experience measure. These results show higher 
returns to experience for both males and females than the results reported 
here, with little change in the coefficients on the education variables. The 
inclusion of the adjusted experience measure reduced the negative effect 
of Aboriginality on male incomes and the coefficient on this variable 
became highly insignificant for females. This suggests that part of the 
negative effect of Aboriginality reported in the results in Table 3.2 may 
be due to the difficulties in measuring true labour force experience. 


The sources of income 
differences 


46 


This section considers the sources of income differences between 
indigenous and non-indigenous Australians for each sex in terms of 
endowments of human capital attributes and the rewards to these 
attributes. The question of the determinants of income differences 
between indigenous males and females will also be considered. 


Any difference in the income of people of different race can be 
considered in three parts: one which is attributable to differences in 
human capital endowments, for example education and experience; one 
which is attributable to differences in the rewards to these endowments; 
and one which is attributable to the error component in the regression 
(Oaxaca 1973; Blinder 1973). ; 


Yni-Yi = (Yni - Xnibni) - (yi-Xibi) + (Xnibni - Xibj) (2) 
where (Xnibni - Xibi) = (Xni - Xi)bi + Xni(bni - bi) (3) 


Where y is actual weekly income, X is a vector of endowments, b the 
estimated regression coefficients. The subscripts i and ni refer to the 
indigenous and non-indigenous populations. The final term in equation 2 
can be broken down into that part attributable to differences in 
endowments (the first term in equation 3) and that part attributable to 
coefficient differences (the second term in equation 3). This latter term 
will include any biases introduced by such things as the omission of 
relevant variables or measurement errors in the included variables, as well 
as differences between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians in the 
‘true’ coefficients. The decomposition can be best thought of as an 
accounting exercise. 


The results of this exercise are presented in Table 3.3. For each racial 
group and sex, the regression coefficients reported in Table 3.2 can be 
used to calculate predicted income for the average in the sample, using 
both the indigenous and non-indigenous coefficients as weights. The 
results show that for men, about 70 per cent of the estimated difference 
in predicted earnings can be accounted for by the lower level of human 
capital endowments of indigenous men compared with non-indigenous 
men. The lower levels of education and the greater proportion of 
indigenous men living outside of the major urban areas were important 
sources of the endowment differences. Differences in the rewards to these 
endowments also played a part in explaining their lower income but 
accounted for less than 10 per cent of the income gap. Similar exercises, 
which try to explain the difference between the employment income of 
Black and White Americans, have found that between 50 and 80 per cent 
of the difference can be accounted for by differences in the measured 
endowments (Ehrenberg and Smith 1987: 537). In the case of Native 
Americans, Sandefur and Scott (1983) found that most of the earnings 
difference could be attributed to endowment differences, while Patrinos 
and Sakellariou (1992) found that only 41 per cent of the income 
difference between Canadian Natives and other Canadians could be 
attributed to endowment differences.

(a) The calculation is based on Table 2, equations 2 and 4. 
Source: 1991 Census. 


The results presented in Table 3.3 column 2 for females, show that the 
gap between the income of indigenous and non-indigenous females 
working full-time was smaller than for males. Endowment differences 
accounted for over 80 per cent of the gap between the income of 
indigenous and non-indigenous females. Location of residence outside of 
the major urban areas, their larger number of dependent children and their 
lower educational attainment were factors which reduced the relative 
income of indigenous females. The results of a decomposition using the 
adjusted experience measure also show that endowment differences were 
the major source of difference between the income of indigenous and 
non-indigenous Australians although these were not as important as in the 
results reported here (see Appendix Table 3A.2). 


It is tempting at first glance to attribute any differences in the rewards to 
endowments to discrimination against indigenous people, and this may 
indeed be a part of the explanation of the lower returns which indigenous 
people receive for their human capital attributes. In addition, the results 
presented here suggest that a major source of income difference is 
Aboriginality per se which affects all indigenous people. There have been 
few systematic attempts to collect evidence of discrimination against 
indigenous Australian people although it is frequently assumed to exist. 
One study (Larsen et al. 1977) found evidence of discrimination against 
indigenous people in Townsville in the areas of employment, housing and 
hotel access.’ 


There are, however, alternative explanations of the lower returns to 
human capital amongst indigenous Australians. Indigenous people may 
make employment choices which do not maximise their monetary income. 
Those living in rural areas and unwilling to migrate to more lucrative 
employment may find themselves restricted in their choice of employment 
to jobs which do not use their skills fully. Even if such work existed, 
they may prefer to take casual work which gives them greater flexibility 
in their use of time. 


3 Riach and Rich (1987) conducted a similar test for sexual discrimination among a group of 
Melboume employers and concluded that women did face discrimination. 


48 


A third possibility is that the coefficient differences arise because of 
measurement problems. The explanatory variables included are the best 
available estimates of a range of underlying factors which are expected to 
have an important influence on income. As already discussed, there are 
problems associated with the measurement of labour market experience 
for a group with intermittent labour supply. Another example is the 
years-of-schooling variable. American evidence suggests that, on average, 
Black Americans have in the past received lower quality schooling than 
White Americans. Several studies have attributed part of the relative 
growth in black incomes in the 1960s and 1970s to raising the quality of 
schooling (Smith and Ward 1989; Card and Krueger 1992). The results 
presented here do not support the hypothesis that the schooling received 
by indigenous Australians has been of inferior quality. However the use 
of the crude count of the number of years of schooling may hide 
important differences. For example, there is evidence of lower literacy 
and numeracy levels among the current generation of indigenous school 
children (Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) 
1994), 


It is perhaps safer to think of the coefficient differences as a ‘measure of 
our ignorance’, rather than at this stage to attribute the differences to any 
particular source. However, the strong negative effect of location of 
residence outside major urban areas on indigenous incomes raises the 
issue of the importance of locational factors for any policies designed to 
increase indigenous employment and incomes. The result suggests either 
that indigenous Australians face particularly strong discrimination in the 
rural areas or that indigenous people living in these rural areas are willing 
to sacrifice a large amount of income in order to stay there rather than 
migrate to employment in a large city. As Altman (1988), Taylor (1988), 
and Altman and Smith (1990) have shown, there are, however, no easy 
solutions to the problems of generating employment in remote areas.

Finally, in Table 3.4, the incomes of indigenous men and women working 
full time are compared. The average indigenous male had an income 

6 per cent higher than the average indigenous female. The decomposition 
of this gap into endowment and coefficient differences is presented, using 
both sets of coefficient weights. The results show that endowment 
differences accounted for none of the income differences; indigenous 
females had greater human capital endowments than indigenous males. 
Coefficient differences were the source of lower incomes for working 
indigenous women. Among these, the strong negative effect of rural 
residence and the different effects on income of family characteristics for 
indigenous females were most important. Family characteristics also had 
different effects on the income of non-indigenous men and women, This 
more general result probably reflects the division of labour within the 
family. 


Conclusion 


49 


Although indigenous people in full-time employment have lower incomes, 
on average, than non-indigenous Australians in full-time employment, 
they are a privileged group in terms of income, when compared with 
indigenous people who are not in employment. This chapter has used the 
framework of human capital theory to decompose the differences in 
income for indigenous and non-indigenous men and women in full-time 
work into that part which can be accounted for by differences in the 
labour market characteristics of indigenous people and unexplained 
differences in the rewards to these characteristics. 


The results show that the main source of lower incomes for indigenous 
males compared with their non-indigenous counterparts was their lower 
level of human capital endowments rather than the rewards they received 
for these endowments. An even stronger result held for females. These 
results emphasising the role of human capital differences in determining 
income differences, are similar to those reported by Sandefur and Scott 
(1983) for Native American males and in contrast to Canadian results 
which emphasise the role of unexplained factors (Patrinos and Sakellariou 
1992). 


In comparing across the sexes, however, the estimates presented here 
show that the differences in rewards for endowments more than accounted 
for the income gap. Given their endowments of human capital, indigenous 
females could be expected to earn more than indigenous males while the 
actual outcome was that they earned less. The result of large differences 
in the rewards for human capital characteristics across the sexes has been 
found in other studies of the pay gap between males and females 
(Gregory et al. 1989; Chapman and Mulvey 1986; Gunderson 1989). In 
fact, it has been argued in the United States context, that racial income 
differentials are more susceptible to change than is the income ratio 
between males and females (Fuchs 1988). 


Human capital endowments and the rewards for them also influence the 
probability of being in employment. The earlier results of chapter 2 
showed that indigenous Australians are less likely to be in full-time 
employment than non-indigenous Australians. It is possible that the 
effects of Aboriginality on labour market outcomes are more apparent at 
the point of entry to employment rather than among those already in 
full-time employment. The evidence presented here does not support the 
hypothesis that indigenous people working full time face a high level of 
discrimination in the earnings they receive. Perhaps this reflects the 
Australian system of wage determination which has limited the extent to 
which the earnings of individuals can fall below the minimums set under 
the award system.

CHAPTER 4 


EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT FOR YOUNG INDIGENOUS 
AUSTRALIANS 


The position of young Australians in the labour market has been of 
concern to policy makers over the past two decades as unemployment 
rates among young people have remained high and well above the 
average for the total labour force. The indigenous population is, on 
average, younger than the total Australian population. In 1991, 35.3 per 
cent of the indigenous population aged 15 years and over, was in the age 
category 15—24 years, compared with 20 per cent of the Australian 
population in general. The position of this group is therefore of particular 
concern as they may be doubly disadvantaged; once in so far as 
Aboriginality is a disadvantage in the labour market and secondly, for 
being young. 


A related issue of concern is the involvement of indigenous youth in the 
criminal justice system. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in 
Custody (RCIADIC) and other studies (for example, Gale, Bailey-Harris 
and Wundersitz 1990) show that young indigenous people have been 
over-represented in the juvenile justice system throughout Australia. The 
RCIADIC noted: 


Not only do they come into the system to a disproportionate 
extent, the penalties which they receive are demonstrably more 
severe than those of equivalent non-Aboriginal juveniles and they 
have an accelerated progression through the various stages of the 
juvenile justice system until the point of detention in a juvenile 
institution (Commonwealth of Australia 1991*: 254-5). 


The importance of the restricted educational and employment 
opportunities available to indigenous youth in producing these results is 
strongly argued in the Royal Commission’s Reports (see especially, 
chapters 14, 16, 17, 30 and 33) (Commonwealth of Australia 1991). Low 
educational attainment and poor labour market outcomes may have major 
implications for the course of an individual’s life. This conclusion has 
also been emphasised in other recent official studies of the educational 
and employment status of indigenous youth (see ATSIC 1994, and DEET 
1994) 


Specific government policies such as Priority One, the Social Strategy for 
Young Australians and the Youth Training Initiative under Working 
Nation have aimed to reduce the high levels of unemployment among 
youth in general by easing the transition from school to work. Schemes 
such as AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY have the explicit aim of encouraging 
young people to stay in education for longer periods based on the 
assumption, for which there is some empirical support, that the more 
educated are more likely to find work (Miller and Volker 1987; Daly 
1993°).' This chapter documents the labour market status and educational 


' AUSTUDY was introduced in 1987 to provide income support for people over the age of 
16 years wishing to continue full-time secondary and tertiary studies. The benefit depends on 
parental income and assets except where the student is classed as independent and their own 
income and assets are tested. ABSTUDY was introduced with similar aims to AUSTUDY, 
‘To encourage and assist Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to take full advantage of the 
educational opportunities available to all Australians’ (Department of Employment, Education 
and Training 1991: 88). It has a secondary and tertiary component and provides additional 
assistance to cover educational expenses beyond direct income support. Some ABSTUDY 
benefits are available earlier than AUSTUDY benefits; full-time secondary students and 
those still at primary school and aged 14 years are entitled to ABSTUDY (Schooling).

attainment of young indigenous people as recorded in the 1991 Census, 
and compares them with other Australian youth. A summary of census 
evidence on the changes that have taken place between 1986 and 1991 is 
also included. 


The period 1986-91 saw important policy changes with potential 
implications for indigenous youth; the introduction of the AEDP which 
aims to promote indigenous employment and the Aboriginal Education 
Policy (AEP) which focuses on indigenous education. As already noted, 
the AEDP has the goals of increasing indigenous employment rates to the 
level of the rest of the Australian population and of reducing indigenous 
welfare dependence (Australian Government 1987; Altman 1991). The 
AEP, established in response to the Report of the Aboriginal Education 
Policy Task Force (Department of Employment, Education and Training 
1988), is an agreement between the Commonwealth and State and 
Territory Governments directed towards raising the educational status of 
Australia’s indigenous people. Along with the AEP, the Aboriginal 
Languages Initiative Program (ALIP) was established in 1992 to 
encourage the use of traditional Aboriginal languages. 


This chapter begins by presenting data on educational attainment and then 
considers the position of young people in the labour market. Two broad 
age categories of youth have been identified for discussion; those aged 
15-19 years and those aged 20-24 years. These age categories cover 
periods of important life cycle changes. The first age category includes, 
for most people, the completion of secondary schooling and the transition 
to higher education or into the labour market. The second category covers 
the beginnings of adult employment for those who left school at an 
earlier age and the transition from education into the labour market for 
those undertaking higher education. Where relevant, more detailed age 
breakdowns will be presented for indigenous people. 


Table 4.1 compares the age at which indigenous and other Australian 
youth had left school in 1991. The lower levels of educational attainment 
of indigenous people documented elsewhere (Tesfaghiorghis and Altman 
1991) are also in evidence here for young indigenous Australians. Among 
15-19 year olds (columns 1 and 2), a smaller proportion of indigenous 
males and females were still at school than among the rest of the 
Australian population; about 33 per cent compared with about 50 per 
cent. This difference was partially offset by the higher proportion of 
indigenous males and females who had left school aged 14 years or 
younger, prior to the compulsory school leaving age; about 10 per cent of 
indigenous people aged 15-19 years had done so compared with 1.4 per 
cent of non-indigenous people in this age category. 


Columns 3 and 4 of Table 4.1 relate to 20-24 year olds, almost all of 
whom had completed their secondary schooling. Most indigenous males 
and females of this age had left school when they were aged 15 or 

16 years, although about 10 per cent had left school at a younger age. A 
much smaller proportion (2 per cent) of non-indigenous people in this age 
category left school before they were 15 years and a larger proportion, 
continued to attend school until they were 17 or 18 years of age. Among 
the wider Australian population, 47.8 per cent of males and 51.4 per cent 
of females left school when they were 17 or 18 years old, compared with 
26.2 per cent of indigenous males and 30.3 per cent of indigenous 
females who left school at these ages.

There is some evidence that these figures may underestimate the 
difference in educational attainment between the two groups. Age on 
leaving school is only a rough indicator of the time actually spent in 
school and the available evidence suggests that indigenous children have 
relatively high truancy rates (Commonwealth of Australia 1991: 364-8; 
House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander Affairs 1992: 67). Other evidence shows that particularly 
in rural and remote locations, the literacy and numeracy achievements of 
indigenous Australian children fall behind those of other Australian 
children and that indigenous children are less likely to be in school for 
all the compulsory years (DEET 1994). 


Table 4.2 presents in more detail the proportion of indigenous youth, at 
each age, who were still attending school. Between the ages of 15 and 

17 years, a higher percentage of indigenous females were at school than 
indigenous males. There was a rapid decline in the proportion of each age 
group who were attending school. School attendance fell from 75 per cent 
of 15 year olds to 9.6 per cent of 18 year olds. 


There is evidence to suggest that coming from a home where an 
Aboriginal language is spoken creates difficulties in being accommodated 
by the mainstream education system. However, this group was a minority 
of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; 17 per cent of 
indigenous people aged 15-24 years stated that the language spoken at 
home was an Aboriginal language rather than English. However, the 


56 


percentage of Aboriginal language speakers who remained at school at 
almost every age was lower than among the indigenous population in 
general. Even amongst Aboriginal language speakers, the proportion who 
had not attended school at all was small, but it was higher than the 
indigenous population in general. Whether these lower levels of education 
represent differences in access to education or perceptions about the 
relevance and benefits of education is a topic for further research.” 


Tables 4.1 and 4.2 relate to attendance in secondary schools, but Table 
4.3 presents data on attendance by young people at any educational 
institution. The table shows that among indigenous youth, a much smaller 
percentage of each age group was in education than non-indigenous 
Australians; 43 per cent of indigenous people aged 15-19 years were 
attending some form of educational institution compared with 70 per cent 
of non-indigenous people. The proportion of indigenous males and 
females aged 20-24 years who were still studying was about a third of 
that of their counterparts in the rest of the Australian population.

Indigenous youth aged 15-19 years who were attending an educational 
institution were more likely to be in secondary schools than at a 
post-secondary institution. The percentage of the age group attending an 
educational institution did not vary greatly by sex, but it is interesting to 
note the slightly larger proportion of females than males attending 
Colleges of Advanced Education (CAE)/university (CAEs are now 
universities). This result was also in evidence for non-indigenous 
Australians aged 15-19 years. 


Technical and Further Education (TAFE) attendance accounted for the 
largest proportion of indigenous people aged 20-24 years who were still 
studying. Over half the indigenous males and females attending an 
educational institution. were at TAFE colleges. These colleges were less 
important among other Australians in this age group and university was a 
more important category. Fifteen per cent of non-indigenous Australians 
aged 20-24 years were attending university in 1991 compared with only 
3.4 per cent of indigenous people in this age group. 


There is some evidence to suggest that combining education with 
employment has a positive effect on the duration of the first post-school 
job (McRae 1992). According to the 1991 Census, indigenous youth 
were, however, less likely to combine education and employment than 
were non-indigenous youth . Fourteen per cent of indigenous males and 
females aged 15-24 years combined education with some form of 
employment. This compared with 33 per cent of non-indigenous males 


58 


and 35 per cent of non-indigenous females who combined the two 
activities. Among those at secondary school, 4 per cent of indigenous 
males and 7 per cent of indigenous females worked while 13 per cent of 
non-indigenous males and 22 per cent of non-indigenous females 
combined secondary school attendance with a job. Only 24 per cent of 
indigenous Australians attending TAFE were employed, compared with 
66 per cent of non-indigenous Australians. University education was less 
likely to be combined with a job than TAFE courses, although 23 per 
cent of indigenous and 43 per cent of non-indigenous university students 
worked. 


The importance of TAFE as an educational institution is reflected in the 
types of qualifications held by 20-24 year olds reported in Table 4.4. 
This group has been selected for this comparison as a larger proportion of 
the 15-19 year olds were yet to complete their education. The most 
frequently reported qualifications for males were at the certificate level. 
Indigenous males were, however, less likely to hold these qualifications 
than were males in general. Twenty-three per cent of non-indigenous 
males aged 20-24 years held certificates compared with 11 per cent of 
indigenous males. There was also a substantial difference between the 
two groups of males in the proportion holding university degrees. While 
6.3 per cent of non-indigenous males in this age group held university 
degrees, only 0.4 per cent of indigenous males did. The proportion of 
indigenous males without any educational qualification was 
correspondingly larger, 88.5 per cent compared with 69.1 per cent.

Labour force status 


There were gender differences in the types of qualifications held, but in 
common with indigenous males, indigenous females were less likely to 
hold a qualification than non-indigenous females. Ninety-two per cent of 
indigenous females held no recognised qualification compared with 73 per 
cent of the non-indigenous female population. Certificates accounted for a 
smaller proportion of qualifications held by females than by males. 
Although indigenous females fell well behind their non-indigenous 
counterparts in terms of university qualifications, twice the proportion of 
young indigenous females held these qualifications than indigenous males. 


The transition of young people from education to participation in the 
labour force is apparent in the data presented in Table 4.5. The proportion 
of the 20-24 year olds who were outside the labour force was smaller for 
each sex and racial group than among 15-19 year olds. The broad picture 
is one of lower rates of employment amongst indigenous people, higher 
rates of unemployment and a larger group of people outside the labour 
market than amongst non-indigenous people. Among the wider Australian 
population aged 15-24 years, most people who were not in the labour 


59 


force were studying; 91.7 per cent of males and 75.9 per cent of females. 
There was, however, a much larger group of indigenous people for whom 
the census provides little information as they were neither in the labour 
force nor attending an educational institution. Forty per cent of 
indigenous males and 60 per cent of indigenous females aged 

1524 years who were classified as ‘not in the labour force’, were not 
attending an educational institution. This lack of information creates a 
substantial gap in our knowledge of the activities of a quarter of young 
indigenous people.

While 57 per cent of indigenous males and females aged 15-19 years 
considered themselves to be outside the labour force about 50 per cent of 
non-indigenous males and females were classified to this group. The ‘not 
in the labour force’ category substantially declined in importance among 
20-24 year olds with the exception of indigenous females. Only 11.7 per 
cent of non-indigenous males aged 20-24 years were outside the labour 
force. The proportion of indigenous males and non-indigenous females in 
this category was close to 22 per cent, but over half the indigenous 
females remained outside the labour force. 


In each age category for both sexes, the proportion in employment was 
much higher for non-indigenous Australians than it was for indigenous 
Australians (see figures 4.1-4.3). There were also important differences in 
the proportion who were unemployed and looking for either full-time or 
part-time work. Unemployment among indigenous males was almost twice

that of non-indigenous males (figure 4.1). A quarter of young indigenous 
males aged 15-24 years were unemployed, compared with 14.5 per cent 
of non-indigenous males. The differences, while remaining large, were 
smaller for females than for males (figure 4.2). Seventeen per cent of 
indigenous females aged 15-24 years were unemployed compared with 11 
per cent of non-indigenous females. It is interesting to note the larger 
proportion of both indigenous males and females who were looking for 
part-time work. 


The causes of the higher rate of indigenous youth unemployment have 
been analysed using data taken from both the census and the Australian 
Longitudinal Survey (ALS) sponsored by DEET. Miller (1989, 1991) 
investigated the influence of Aboriginality on the probability of a young 
individual being unemployed. In the context of a formal model of the 
determinants of unemployment, he controlled for factors such as 
education levels, marital status and number of children, location of 
residence, age, and where relevant, the employment status of a spouse, to 
see if there was an independent influence of Aboriginality on the 
probability of an individual being unemployed. He concluded that, 
holding all these other factors constant, the unemployment rate of 
Aboriginal youth is predicted to be about two-and-one-half times greater 
than that of other groups. This standardised unemployment rate 
differential is one of the most pronounced in the youth labour market 
(Miller 1989: 12). 


The difference in the unemployment rate could be explained only partially 
by differences in measured characteristics such as education levels and 
age. The major part of the differences in unemployment probabilities 
remained unexplained and could be attributed to either cultural differences 
in labour supply behaviour or differences in the demand for indigenous 
labour arising, perhaps, from discrimination. Miller’s results therefore 
support the hypothesis presented in chapter 2, that there are important 
differences in the determinants of employment status for indigenous and 
other Australians which go beyond differences in the standard measured 
attributes. 


Other studies of indigenous labour market participation (Ross 1991; Daly 
1993*) have emphasised place of residence as an important factor in 
determining labour market outcomes. These studies show that the size of 
the settlement in which the individual resided appears to be a more 
important determinant of labour force status for indigenous people than 
for non-indigenous people. This result applied to young people (see 

Table 4.6). There was little difference in the proportion of non-indigenous 
males in employment in the three settlement categories identified; major 
urban centres, other urban and rural. However, among young indigenous 
males, the employment/population ratio was highest in the rural category 
and lowest in other urban areas. The census recorded the highest 
unemployment rates for indigenous males in the ‘other urban’ category. 
Twenty-six per cent of 15-19 year old males and 40 per cent of 

20-24 year old males living in these towns were unemployed, compared 
with 25 and 34 per cent of each age category in the major urban areas 
and 14 and 17 per cent in rural areas. The differences probably reflect the 
concentration of CDEP communities in the rural areas (see Chapter 1).

Non-indigenous females were less likely to be in employment, and more 
likely to be outside the labour force, if they lived in a rural rather than an 
urban area. Among indigenous females this tendency was more 
pronounced. As for males, the measured rate of unemployment was 
lowest in the rural category. About 11 per cent of young indigenous 
women were Classified as unemployed in the rural areas, which is well 
below the unemployment/population rate in urban areas. This was similar 


63 


to the proportion of non-indigenous women in these age groups who were 
unemployed. 


Tables 4.7 to 4.9 describe the activities of employed youth in more detail. 
Table 4.7 focuses on occupational distribution. Among both indigenous 
and non-indigenous 15-19 year old males, employment was heavily 
concentrated in two broad occupational categories, tradespersons and 
labourers. These two categories accounted for 75.5 per cent of indigenous 
employment and 65 per cent of the employment of non-indigenous males 
in this age group. An interesting difference between the two groups 
relates to the proportion employed as salespersons; 6 per cent of 
indigenous 15-19 year old males were employed as salespersons 
compared with 18.4 per cent of other Australian males in this age 
category.

3 This result could be interpreted as providing some superficial evidence of consumer 
discrimination against Aboriginal people. Becker (1957: 57) hypothesised that ‘a consumer’s 
evaluation of a retail store may be based not only on the prices, speed of service, and 
reliability but also on the sex, race, religion, and personality of the sales personnel’. Where 
consumers discriminated against a particular racial group, that group would be less likely to 
be found in direct contact with customers. 


The 20-24 year age group of males was spread more widely across the 
broad occupational categories, but labouring remained the most frequent 
occupation for indigenous males. Indigenous males aged 20-24 years 
were concentrated among the lower skilled occupations. Once again, 
indigenous males were under-represented as salespersons compared with 
other Australian males. 


Trade occupations were far less important for females than they were for 
males. Among those females aged 15-19 years, 62.5 per cent of 
indigenous and 77.5 per cent of non-indigenous Australians were in the 
two occupational categories of clerks and salespersons. Sales occupations 
were once again less important for indigenous females than for 
non-indigenous females. The proportion of indigenous females occupied 
as labourers was about twice as large as among non-indigenous females 
of this age. This may reflect the classification of CDEP scheme workers 
to this category. 


The proportion of females who were classified as clerks actually 
increased among the 20-24 year olds and salespersons declined in 
significance. There was a larger share working in professional and 
para-professional occupations. The proportion of indigenous females 
employed as labourers remained at about twice that of other Australian 
females. 


Table 4.8 presents data on the distribution of youth employment by broad 
industry group. There were substantial differences between the industry 
distribution of employment when comparing 15-19 year old indigenous 
and non-indigenous Australian males. More than 50 per cent of the latter 
were employed in two industries: manufacturing, and wholesale and retail 
trade. In contrast, indigenous males were spread over a wider range of 
industries. Wholesale and retail trade, community services, public 
administration and manufacturing were the major industries of indigenous 
male employment. The relatively small proportion of indigenous males 
occupied as salespersons (see Table 4.7) was reflected in the smaller 
proportion of indigenous males working in wholesale and retail trade. 
This difference is significant as the wholesale and retail sector is typically 
the major employer of young males.” In common with findings for the 
whole of the indigenous population, a much larger proportion of 

15-19 year old indigenous males were employed in community services 
and public administration than were males in the rest of the population. 


These differences were also apparent in the industry distribution of 
20-24 year old males although retail and wholesale trade had ceased to 
dominate their employment so dramatically. The three largest industry 
employers of non-indigenous males aged 20-24 years were wholesale and 
retail trade, manufacturing and finance, property and related services. The 
major employers of indigenous males were community services, public 
administration and the wholesale and retail trade. 


Indigenous females also showed a different employment pattern to their 
counterparts in the wider population. Community services and public 
administration were much more important as employers of indigenous 
females than of other females. This was especially the case among 

15-19 year old females. While over half of non-indigenous females of the 


* See for example, Daly (1990) who compares the distribution of the employment of 
16-19 year old males by industry in Australia, Great Britain and the United States of 
America. In each of these countries in 1981, wholesale and retail trade was the largest 
industry employer of young male labour, accounting for at least one-quarter of total 
employment.

- same age were employed in the wholesale and retail trade, a smaller 
30 per cent of indigenous females worked in this industry. Another 
industry where indigenous females were relatively under-represented was 
in the area of finance, property and business services.

Table 4.9 presents industry data on the basis of sector of employment. 
Indigenous males and females in each of the age categories were more 
likely to be employed in the public sector than were other Australians. 
These figures present a minimum estimate of the difference for the reason 
presented in Chapter 1. A quarter of indigenous males aged 15-19 years 
worked in the public sector as defined here, compared with 11 per cent 
of non-indigenous males of this age. The public sector was even more 
important among 20-24 year old males. A third of indigenous males aged 
20-24 years worked for the government compared with 18 per cent of 
other males. State and local governments were more important as 
employers of young indigenous males than they were for non-indigenous 
males.

The income of young 
indigenous Australians 


Public sector employment was particularly important for indigenous 
females, especially those aged 20-24 years. Forty-two per cent of 
indigenous females aged 20-24 years in employment were working for 
government. The Commonwealth Government and the State Governments 
were the two major employers. 


In summary, many of the differences that are apparent in a comparison of 
the labour market characteristics of the total indigenous population with 
the rest of the Australian population, are in evidence among the young 
indigenous population. The data presented here do not suggest that there 
has been a dramatic change in the types of economic activities being 
undertaken by the new indigenous entrants to the labour market. 
Indigenous youth tended to be employed in the lower-skilled occupations 
and concentrated in public sector employment to a greater extent than 
non-indigenous youth. The next section will present data on the 
implications of these differences for the income status of indigenous 
youth compared with non-indigenous youth. 


Table 4.10 presents data on the median income of young people 
according to their labour market status. Among 15-19 year olds, 
indigenous people fared relatively well. Indigenous males had a median 
income equal to that of non-indigenous males, while indigenous females 
had an average income 1.4 times that of non-indigenous females. In each 
labour force group, apart from employed males, indigenous people of this 
age actually had a higher average income than other young Australians.

These are surprising results and perhaps can be explained by a number of 
factors. Firstly, part-time employment was greater for non-indigenous than 
for indigenous 15—19 year olds and the category ‘employment’ covers 
both full and part-time workers. Furthermore, relatively more indigenous 
youth were receiving educational benefits such as ABSTUDY which 
would boost their individual incomes because payments under ABSTUDY 
are more generous than under AUSTUDY (see footnote 1). 


The income differences were much more pronounced for 20-24 year olds. 
Indigenous males and females of this age group had a median income 

56 per cent of their counterparts in the rest of the population. The figures 
presented here emphasise the importance of employment in raising 
income. It is the large differences in the proportion of 20-24 year olds in 
employment which accounts for the substantial difference in median 


income. 
Changes in education and Between 1986 and 1991 the number of Aborigines aged 15-24 years 
employment for young grew by 12 per cent, a growth of 6,273 people. This compared with a 
indigenous Australians, growth rate of 2.6 per cent and 65,466 people amongst other Australian 


1986-91 youth. This section presents a summary of the changes in the employment 


68 


and education status of indigenous youth between the 1986 and 1991 
censuses (for a fuller discussion see Daly 1993° and 1993°. 


Between the two census years, there was a substantial increase in the age 
at which 15-19 year olds left school and in the proportion who were still 
at school. These results held for both males and females. However, the 
growth in educational attendance as measured by age on leaving school, 
was not as strong for indigenous youth as for non-indigenous youth. The 
proportion of young indigenous people who had received no schooling 
continued to fall, but there was little change for non-indigenous 
Australians as those who had received no schooling continued to account 
for less than 1 per cent of the 15-24 age group. 


The general increasing attendance of young people at educational 
institutions was in evidence across the whole range of educational 
institutions. Amongst indigenous youth, the share of the 15-19 year age 
group attending an educational institution rose by 6.1 percentage points 
and for 20-24 year olds, by 2.4 percentage points between 1986 and 
1991. These increases however, remained below the growth in educational 
attendance for the rest of Australian youth. Some interesting differences 
between the sexes are apparent among the indigenous 20-24 year age 
group. While males experienced greater growth in attendance at TAFE 
colleges, the growth in the number of indigenous women attending 
university was greater than for males. 


Some important changes took place in labour force status. The declining 
opportunities for full-time employment and the increasing importance of 
part-time employment for this age group are very much in evidence in 
the changes which took place in the shares of labour force status 
categories. There were however, some important differences between 
indigenous and non-indigenous youth. While the proportion of indigenous 
youth in employment remained below that of non-indigenous youth, the 
share of indigenous youth in employment increased between 1986 and 
1991 by 1.6 percentage points at a time when it declined by 7.9 
percentage points for other young Australians. 


As already described, there has been substantial growth in the retention of 
young Australians at educational institutions and the fall in the share in 
employment may be attributable in part to the increasing numbers still 
studying. The evidence presented here shows that the fall in employment 
for non-indigenous 15-19 year olds of 8.5 per cent was almost wholly 
offset by the increase in the proportion not in the labour force. Between 
1986 and 1991, the census recorded little change in the proportion of this 
group unemployed and looking for full-time work. Among indigenous 
people in the 15-19 year age group, the increase in employment was 
associated with an increase in the proportion outside the labour force and 
a decline in unemployment. In other words comparing 1986 and 1991, in 
an accounting sense, there was a movement of 15-19 year old indigenous 
people out of unemployment into the employment and not in the labour 
force categories, while for non-indigenous Australians in this age group 
the movement has been from employment to outside the labour force. 
This was true for both males and females. The growth of the not in the 
labour force category can be partially explained by the increase in 
educational retention rates but may also reflect any growth in the number 
of young discouraged workers who have ceased to look for employment. 


The pattern for 20-24 year olds was somewhat different. There was a 
decline in the share of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians in this 


Conclusion 


69 


age group in full-time employment. However, this was offset by an 
increase in part-time employment for indigenous youth but not for other 
Australian youth. The pattern of change in indigenous labour force status 
varied by section-of State. The increase in the share of 15-24 year old 
indigenous people in employment was concentrated in the rural areas and 
the employment share actually fell in the urban areas. 


There were also some substantial changes in the types of employment of 
indigenous youth. Among indigenous and non-indigenous Australians 
aged 15-19 years, the largest changes were the relative decline in the 
employment of clerks and the increase in the employment of salespersons, 
especially among non-indigenous people. The share of clerical 
employment in the total employment of 20-24 year olds also fell for both 
indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, while salespersons accounted 
for a larger share of this age group’s employment. The share of 
employment of indigenous 20-24 year olds in labouring occupations fell. 


These occupational shifts are also apparent in the changes which took 
place in the industry of employment. Wholesale and retail trade increased 
its share of employment for both indigenous and other young Australians 
while agriculture recorded a declining share. Community services had the 
fastest growing share of indigenous employment in each age group in 
contrast to the small decline in the share of employment in this industry 
among other young Australians. For these people, the wholesale and retail 
trade was the fastest growing industry for 15-19 year old employment, 
with recreational and personal services for 20-24 year olds. 


A final comparison to be made between 1986 and 1991 Census data 
relates to income. The income ratio did not change greatly over this 
limited period. There was however, some fall in the relative median 
income of employed indigenous males, perhaps reflecting a growing 
concentration in part-time CDEP employment. 


The position of young indigenous people in the labour market and in the 
education system is an important indicator of the effects of education and 
employment policy because it is among this group that signs of 
improvement in socioeconomic status should be most apparent. For 
example, a policy aimed at raising indigenous educational attainment will 
have little direct impact on the educational levels of fifty year olds, but 
rather, should influence the attainment of those currently completing their 
education. 


While there have been significant improvements in the educational 
attainment of indigenous people in the last twenty years, this chapter 
shows that a substantial gap remains to be closed before the AEP goal of 
equality in educational attainment is achieved. The census data show that 
young indigenous people were more likely to have left school early and 
had lower levels of qualifications than non-indigenous Australians. The 
estimated differences in educational attainment presented here are 
probably conservative. 


The evidence on labour market activity also suggests that indigenous 
youth remain at a disadvantage compared with non-indigenous youth. 
They were less likely to be in employment and more likely to be 
unemployed. A large group of young indigenous people, especially 
females, remained outside the labour force and as they were not recorded 
as attending an educational institution, the census provides no information 
on their activities. 


70 


The most recent recession appears, however, to have affected the labour 
market status of young indigenous and non-indigenous Australians in 
different ways. While the share of full-time employment declined for all 
young Australians between 1986 and 1991, the increase in the share of 
young indigenous people in part-time employment was sufficient to offset 
this. As a consequence, the proportion of Aborigines in this age group in 
employment actually rose between 1986 and 1991. This contrasted with a 
decline for other young Australians. The proportion of young Aborigines 
who were unemployed also fell, once again in contrast to the increase 
among other young Australians. The increase in educational retention 
rates, especially among 15—19 year old non-indigenous youth, is reflected 
in the increased proportion who were not in the labour force. 


The data presented here show that those indigenous people in 
employment were in lower skilled jobs compared to their non-indigenous 
counterparts and were more likely to be in public sector employment. The 
differences in the employment rate and the types of work of indigenous 
and non-indigenous youth have important implications for their income 
status. Among 15-19 year olds, there was little difference in median 
incomes for the two groups but among 20-24 year olds, where a larger 
proportion of non-indigenous people were in employment, indigenous 
median income fell to 56 per cent of that of non-indigenous people. This 
ratio had changed little since 1986.

CHAPTER 5 


OLDER INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS IN THE LABOUR MARKET 


The purpose of this chapter is to document the educational and economic 
status of older indigenous Australians and to make comparisons with 
other Australians in the same age group. These people aged 50 years and 
over in 1991, grew up under a very different legal regime to that found 
today. Prior to the legal and policy changes of the 1960s and 70s, the 
underlying philosophies guiding relationships between the state and 
Australia’s indigenous people were ‘protection’ and ‘assimilation’. These 
excluded indigenous people from many of the rights of citizenship held 
by other Australians (Rowley (1971° and by Broom and Jones (1973), 
Altman and Sanders 1991*). Each State government was responsible for 
the welfare of its indigenous population and Commonwealth government 
intervention in indigenous affairs was limited by the Constitution. The 
indigenous people belonging to the age group covered in this chapter 
spent their formative years under regimes, varying according to State, 
which restricted their movements, limited their ability to receive cash 
payments for work or their entitlement to social security, and offered 
limited educational opportunities. 


The first part of the chapter examines the consequences of some of these 
policies for the educational status of indigenous people aged 50 years and 
over in 1991. The second part describes their labour market status, 
including the distribution of the employed by occupation and industry, 
and their income status. These outcomes are a product of both past and 
present actions. A final section highlights the significant changes in these 
indicators between 1986 and 1991 for those aged 50 years and over. 

’ These changes reflect both the changes in the opportunities available to 
different age cohorts during their formative years and the prevailing 
conditions at the time of the 1986 and 1991 Censuses. 


There are important differences in the demographic structure of the 
indigenous and non-indigenous populations of Australia (see also chapter 
4). Older people form a much smaller proportion of the adult indigenous 
population than older non-indigenous people. In 1991, 15 per cent of the 
indigenous population aged 15 and over were aged 50 years and over, 
compared with 32 per cent of other Australians. Females accounted for 
53 per cent of each group. Between 1971 and 1991, the 5O and over age 
group accounted for a fairly constant 31 per cent of the non-indigenous 
population aged over 15 years, but the percentage of the adult indigenous 
population in this age group fell from 19 per cent in 1971 to 15 per cent 
in 1991. 


These figures reflect not only the higher birth rate of indigenous people, 
compared with other Australians (Gaminiratne 1992), but also their 
shorter life expectancy. The life expectancy of indigenous people varies 
by region across Australia, and estimates put it at between 10 and 

20 years less than that of the total Australian population. Indigenous 
Australians have much higher death rates during adult years than other 
Australians; the major causes of death being circulatory diseases and 
extemal causes, such as motor vehicle and other accidents, suicide and 
homicide (Gray 1990; Saggers and Gray 1991; Thomson and Briscoe 
1991", 1991", 1991, 19919, 1991°). The higher adult death rate is 


Educational attainment 


72 


indicative of wider indigenous heath problems which inhibit the ability of 
individuals in older age groups to actively participate in paid 
employment. Unfortunately, the important issue of health is not addressed 
in the census. 


Tables 5.1 and 5.2 present comparative data on the educational attainment 
of indigenous males and females aged 50 and over. It is important to 
remember that these data relate to people born before 1942, and as such 
their involvement in the education system substantially predates all the 
recent government policies which have aimed to raise the educational 
attainment of indigenous people. Table 5.1 compares the age on leaving 
school for 50-64 year olds and those over 65 years of age. In each age 
group indigenous people had less formal schooling, on average than other 
Australians. Seventeen per cent of indigenous people aged 50-64 years in 
1991 had not attended school compared with 2 per cent of other 
Australians. Only 6 per cent had continued at school after the age of 

16 years compared with 18 per cent of other Australians. A similar 
pattern was in evidence for each sex. There is some evidence however, of 
improved access to schooling for indigenous Australians in the 1930s and 
1940s compared with earlier periods. Among the older age group, those 
aged 65 years and over, 32 per cent had received no schooling compared 
with 2 per cent of other Australians. While the share with no schooling 
had therefore remained constant between the two age categories for 
non-indigenous Australians, it fell by 15 percentage points for indigenous 
Australians.

Table 5.2 also shows a substantial difference in the level of qualifications 
held by indigenous and other Australians. (In the interests of the economy 
of space the two age categories have been combined as the broad 
conclusions remain the same). Ninety-five per cent of indigenous males 
and females aged 50 years and over held no qualification, compared with 
75.3 per cent of other Australians. Males were somewhat more likely to 
hold a qualification than females. Certificates were by far the most 
important type of qualification held by males, but there was a 

20 percentage point difference between indigenous and other Australians 
in the share of males with these qualifications. These differences in 
educational attainment might be expected to effect labour force status, the 
issue of the next section.

Labour market status 


The employment population ratio of indigenous males and females aged 
50 years and over has fallen below that of other Australians in each 
census since 1976. An implication of this for indigenous males is that 
their employment ratio has not kept up with the declining ratio in the 
wider male population. (For a discussion of the international trend toward 
declining participation rates among older males see Pencavel (1986) and 
Juhn (1992)). Against the general trend of a rising employment 
population ratio for females, this ratio fell slightly for indigenous and 
non-indigenous females aged 50 years and over during the period 
1976-86. This declining trend was, however, reversed between 1986 and 
1991. 


Table 5.3 presents more detailed data from the 1991 Census on the labour 
force status of this group by age category and sex and figures 5.1-5.3 
highlight the major differences between indigenous and other Australians. 
The table shows that for both indigenous and non-indigenous 

Australians, there are strong life cycle effects on labour force participation 
and employment. A familiar pattern, however, is apparent. Indigenous 
people experienced lower rates of employment, higher rates of 
unemployment and a higher incidence of people outside the labour force 
(see figure 5.3), Even among the age group most likely to be in the 
labour force, 50-54 year olds, over half of indigenous people were not in 
the labour force compared with 26.5 per cent of non-indigenous 
Australians. 


Full-time employment accounted for the larger share of those in 
employment for both indigenous and other Australians. Although the 
CDEP scheme provides part-time jobs for people in indigenous 
communities, and therefore could be expected to add to the number of 
reported part-time workers, the proportion of persons working part-time 
was higher among other Australians than among indigenous people.

Among 50-54 year old non-indigenous males, 79.8 per cent were in 
employment, but for those aged 65 years and over and entitled to a 
pension, paid employment was a minority activity. An equivalent pattern 
of declining employment rates was also in evidence for indigenous males 
but even among 50-54 year olds, only 37.5 per cent were in employment. 
The lower employment rates of indigenous males in this age group were 
offset by higher unemployment rates, but more importantly by a larger 
proportion who described themselves as being outside the labour force. 
Forty per cent of the indigenous males in this age group considered 
themselves outside the labour force, compared with 13 per cent of 
non-indigenous males, a ratio of three (see figure 5.1). Either this group 
had never actively participated in paid employment, or the transition out 
of the labour force came at a much earlier age for indigenous than for 
non-indigenous males.

There was a similar proportion of indigenous and non-indigenous males 
in part-time employment. In the case of indigenous males, this should 
include those who were working part-time under the CDEP scheme. 
However, as a share of total employment, part-time employment was 
more important for indigenous males, accounting for a quarter of 
employment compared with 18 per cent of employment among other 
Australian males over 50 years of age. 


There were proportionately fewer females over 50 years in paid 
employment than males, but the same pattern of reducing attachment to 
the labour force with age was apparent. Fifty-five per cent of 
non-indigenous females aged 50-54 years were in employment, while 

3 per cent of those over 65 years of age were in this category. There was 
a similar, but not so dramatic, decline in the employment rate of 
indigenous females. Even at its peak among 50-54 year olds, only 28 per 
cent of indigenous females were in employment, but this figure fell to 

3 per cent among those over 65 years. Females are currently eligible for 
the old age pension from 60 years, but the steady decline in the 
proportion in employment preceeded the age of eligibility for the old age 
pension. Unemployment was markedly lower among females than among 
males, but the indigenous rate remained above the non-indigenous rate 
(see figure 5.2). Any effect of the CDEP scheme in promoting part-time 
employment for indigenous females, was not sufficient to make part-time 
employment a more frequent activity for indigenous compared with other 
Australian females. 


Location of residence, as measured by section-of-State, is an important 
determinant of labour force status for indigenous people. Table 5.4 
presents labour force status of older indigenous and non-indigenous 
Australians for two broad age categories; those aged 50-64 years and still 
of working age, and those over 64 years, by section-of-State.

centres but there were similar unemployment rates in the rural areas for 
indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. This probably reflects the shift 
of people, particularly males, out of unemployment into employment 


under the CDEP scheme (Taylor 1993). 


Retirement from paid employment was the major activity for all people 
over the age of 64 years. The largest group to remain in employment 
among this age group were those living in rural areas. Almost one-fifth of 
non-indigenous males over the age of 64 years and living in a rural area 


were employed. 


Industry and occupation of 
employment 


78 


As Table 5.3 shows, paid employment among these older people was 
mainly restricted to those of working age, that is aged 50-64 years.’ 
Tables 5.5 and 5.6 therefore relate to this age group. The results follow 
the general patterns of indigenous employment concentration in the less 
skilled occupations, and in particular industries. 


About a third of indigenous males and females in employment were 
occupied as labourers over twice the percentage of other Australian males 
and females (see Table 5.5). Indigenous males were correspondingly 
under-represented among the more skilled occupations of managers and 
professionals. While proportionately fewer indigenous females were 
occupied as managers and professionals, it is interesting to note that 
para-professionals represented a slightly larger proportion of employed 
indigenous females than other Australian females. Older indigenous 
females were less likely to be employed as clerks than other Australian 
females. 


Table 5.6 describes the industry of employment of indigenous people 
aged 50-64 years and compares this to the industry distribution of other 
Australians. The general result that indigenous people tend to be 
concentrated in community services and public administration is also 
apparent among these older workers (Taylor 1992). Half of older 
indigenous people were employed in these two sectors compared with a 
quarter of other Australians. Indigenous males were less likely to be in 
the manufacturing and wholesale and retail trades than other Australian 
males. Indigenous females were also under-represented in wholesale and 
retail trade and in the finance and property industries.

Income 


This concentration of indigenous employment in particular industries is 
also apparent in the industry data presented in Table 5.7 on a 
government/private sector basis. Both indigenous males and females were 
more likely to work in the public sector than their non-indigenous 
counterparts. The State governments were particularly important 
employers of Aboriginal people, accounting for almost a quarter of the 
total indigenous employment in this age group. 


A major research question which arises from any discussion of the 
declining labour force participation of people aged 50 years and over 
relates to their alternative sources of income outside employment (see 
Woodland 1987 for a discussion of the relationship between labour force 
status and eligibility for the pension). Unfortunately, the census does not 
provide any information on sources of income, but case study evidence 
relating to indigenous people suggests that welfare transfers from 
government accounted for an important part of the income of people who 
were not in paid employment (Fisk 1985; Altman and Smith 1993). 
Among Australians in general, the 1986 Income and Housing Survey 
showed that for those over the age of 50 years, 50 per cent of males and 
80 per cent of females cited a government pension as their principle 
source of income. Amongst those not in the labour force, 70 per cent 
received more than half of their income from government pensions (ABS 
1989). 


The census does however, provide a breakdown of income according to 
labour force status, and these figures for indigenous and non-indigenous 
males and females aged 50-64 years are presented in Table 5.8. The table 
also presents data on the median income of those 65 years and over. 
Familiar themes are apparent in these data. Indigenous people of working 
age had a median income 60 per cent of other Australians but this rose to 
90 per cent among the over 65 year olds, as the proportion of 
non-indigenous people in employment declined. 


81 


Indigenous males aged 50-64 years and in employment had a median 
income equal to 70 per cent of other Australian males in employment. 
However, for those classified as either unemployed or not in the labour 
force, the median income was 90 per cent of that of other Australian 
males, Taking the group as a whole, indigenous males had a median 
income which was 50 per cent that of other Australians in the same age 
category. This difference can be explained by the much larger proportion 
of non-indigenous males in employment. 


There was a smaller income gap for indigenous females aged 50-64 years 
compared with other Australian females than for males, a ratio of 90 per 
cent. The median income of indigenous females who were unemployed 
was equal to that of other Australian females and for those outside the 
labour force, it was 10 per cent higher. Indigenous females in 
employment had a lower income than their non-indigenous counterparts. 


In 1991, the basic annual old age pension was $150.80 per week 
($7,841.60 per year) for an individual and $251.50 per week 

($13,078.0 per year) for a couple living together. Females over the age of 
60 years and males over the age of 65 were entitled to this, subject to 
both income and assets tests. The median income for those 65 years and 
over ‘reported in Table 5.8 is rather low given this pension entitlement, 
and suggests that there may be some under-reporting of income by this 
group or perhaps a group of people who have not taken up their pension 
entitlement. The census figures show that indigenous males had an 
income which was 80 per cent of their non-Aboriginal counterparts, while 
indigenous females had the same median income. 


The data presented in Table 5.8 relate to individual incomes. An 
individual’s economic wellbeing also depends on the incomes of other 
members of the household and the number of people who share the 
household income. Figure 5.4 shows that there are substantial differences 
in the types of households in which older indigenous and other Australian 
people lived. The most striking feature of the graph is the much larger 
percentage of older indigenous people living in large households. 
Twenty-nine per cent of indigenous persons in each age category lived in 
households of six or more people, compared with 2-3 per cent of other 
Australians. This difference was offset by the smaller percentage of 
non-indigenous Australians living in small households. It is not proposed 
to investigate these differences in household structure in greater detail 
here, but they do suggest that the level of household, as well as 
individual income, may be an important determinant of the economic 
status of this age group.

In an attempt to standardise differences in household size, Table 5.9 
compares the median income per median number of household members 
for indigenous and non-indigenous Australians in two age categories: 
50-64 years and those over 64 years. There are a number of shortcomings 
with these figures, and they should be thought of as a rough guide to the 
order of magnitude of income differences between indigenous and other 
Australians. A major problem has been one of non-response. In the 1986 
Census, the ‘not stated’ category for indigenous household income 
accounted for 24 per cent of all indigenous households because household 
income was not calculated whenever any of the necessary individual 
income data for its calculation were missing. In 1991, for the first time, 
the ABS has imputed missing income data and this has reduced the ‘not 
stated’ category for household income to 6 per cent of households. It 
should also be noted that these figures relate to individuals living in 
private dwellings and exclude the institutionalised population. 


As Table 5.9 shows, taking the differences in household structures into 
account changed the relative position of older indigenous people 
compared with other Australians. The median income of households 
which had one indigenous resident aged 50-64 years was 90 per cent of 
other Australian households containing a person in this age group. 
However, once the larger size of indigenous households was taken into 
account, the median income per household member fell to half that of 
non-indigenous households. There was a similar fall in the income ratio 
for households containing a person aged 65 years and over. The median 
income for these indigenous households was 40 per cent higher than for 
non-indigenous households but the larger household size meant that ratio 
of income per household member for indigenous households fell to 71 per 
cent of that of non-indigenous households. 


This section presents data on the changing education and employment 
status of older indigenous Australians compared with other Australians, 
over the period 1986-91. These outcomes reflect both changes between 
age cohorts and the more widespread conditions prevailing at the time of 
each census. So, for example the changing educational attainment 
suggests an improvement in educational opportunities for indigenous 
Australians roughly between the 1930s and 1940s. It is unlikely that 
changes in the educational opportunities of indigenous Australians 
between 1986 and 1991 will have much altered the educational attainment 
of these older people. However, the improvement in labour force status 
between the two census years indicates the effects of changing conditions 
in the labour market over that period in addition to any cohort-specific 
effects. For a fuller discussion of these changes and the 1986 data see 
Daly (1994*) and Daly (1993°). 


There is some evidence that birth cohort influenced educational 
attainment. In comparison to the people who were aged 50 years and over 
in 1986, those aged 50 years and over in 1991 (these groups are of 
course, not mutually exclusive) had a higher level of educational 
attainment. Among indigenous people, there had been a substantial 
decline in the share of those who had never attended school 

(16 percentage points), and among non-indigenous people, a substantial 
decline in the share of those who had left school before the age of 

15 years (8 percentage points). Although there is evidence that there was 
some improvement in the access to schooling for this age group of 
indigenous Australians, the fact that other Australians also increased their 
age on leaving school, means that indigenous people remained behind in 
terms of years of schooling. 


Summary and conclusion 


83 


The changes in the labour force status of indigenous people also suggest 
some positive developments. There was relatively strong growth in the 
share of employment for indigenous Australians in each of these age 
categories over the five year period which exceeded that for other 
Australians (3 percentage points compared with 1 percentage point). The 
indigenous not in the labour force category declined by 3 percentage 
points, while this category grew among other Australians by 1 percentage 
point. This improvement in the employment status of indigenous people 
relative to other Australians is probably a result of the expansion of the 
CDEP scheme and as such, should not be taken as an indicator of 
indigenous employment growth apart from that related to direct 
government support. 


There were some significant changes in the types of work of indigenous 
people aged 50-64 years. There was a substantial decline in the share of 
indigenous Australians employed as labourers (10 percentage points) and 
increases in the proportion employed in the more skilled occupations, 
including managerial, professional and para-professional occupations. 
These results held for both males and females and there were larger 
absolute changes in the occupational distribution of indigenous than 
non-indigenous Australians. 


There were also some quite large changes in the relative importance of 
particular industries for employment with wholesale and retail trade and 
community services increasing their share of employment by 2 and 

4 percentage points respectively. Among indigenous people, agriculture 
and transport and storage each reduced their share of employment by 

3 percentage points. At a sector level, the decline in the share of 
indigenous employment in State governments was offset by an increase in 
the share of employment classified to the private sector. 


There was no change between 1986 and 1991 in the income ratio for 
males and females in the two age categories identified. This is an 
important result that the relative rise in employment among indigenous 
people in this age group has not been matched by an improvement in 
their relative income status. This probably reflects the role of the CDEP 
scheme in increasing the numbers recorded as employed in the census, 
but as people are usually paid the equivalent of their social security 
entitlement under the scheme, the rise in employment has not create an 
improvement in relative income status. 


This chapter describes the economic status of older indigenous people in 
the labour market. Census data show that they had markedly lower levels 
of educational attainment than other Australians in this age group and this 
had important implications for the type of occupations available to those 
indigenous Australians. who were in work. About a third of males and 
females in employment were working as labourers, a category which 
accounted for 15 per cent of employment among other Australians over 
50 years of age. 


Many of the results shown in other labour market comparisons between 
the indigenous and non-indigenous populations of Australia are also 
apparent in this comparison of older people. Indigenous males and 
females over 50 years were less likely to be employed, and more likely 
to be unemployed or outside the labour force, than their counterparts 
among other Australians. The fact that indigenous people appear to 
withdraw from the labour force at an earlier age than other Australians 
raises the whole issue of the association between poor health status and 


84 


the ability to maintain employment. The importance of the public sector 
as an employer of indigenous labour was also apparent for these older 
indigenous people. Older indigenous workers were concentrated to a 
greater extent than other Australians in the industry divisions of public 
administration and community services. These factors were reflected in 
their lower median individual incomes. 


The evidence presented in this chapter raises some important 
considerations for the delivery of services to older indigenous Australians. 
They were more likely to live in large households with lower incomes 
outside the major urban centres than were older non-indigenous 
Australians and were therefore likely to face a different set of problems 
in old age.

CHAPTER 6 


SELF-EMPLOYED INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS 


Self-employment is regarded as an important avenue for social and 
economic advancement for certain groups in the population. In many 
countries it is of particular importance for some migrant groups, but even 
within these groups there are sharp ethnic differences in the rate of 
self-employment (Rees and Shah 1986; Evans 1989; Borjas 1986; Kidd 
1993). Self-employment is one means by which ethnic groups can 
overcome problems such as language difficulties and unrecognised 
qualifications. It may also be important as a way of circumventing 

‘ discrimination in employment. Some Australian evidence suggests that 
self-employment may be particularly profitable where there are large 
concentrations of an ethnic group. Members have an advantage in 
providing goods and services to the group through their knowledge of the 
relevant language and culture (Evans 1989). 


The purpose of this chapter is to describe the characteristics of 
self-employed indigenous Australians as reported in the census, and to 
outline some of the major issues highlighted in the literature on 
indigenous entrepreneurial activity. While much has been written on the 
need to promote indigenous enterprises, little has been written on the 
self-employed as a group. 


Although indigenous Australians and migrants may encounter similar 
labour market difficulties, such as language problems and discrimination, 
according to the census, self-employment is uncommon among indigenous 
Australians. The Miller Report (1985) commented on the low rate of 
self-employment among indigenous Australians as recorded in the 1971 
and 1981 Censuses. In 1991, the indigenous working-age population had 
a self-employment rate one-fifth of the rest of the Australian population; 
2.2 per cent compared with 11.1 per cent. Census figures, however, show 
that between 1986 and 1991, there was a greater proportional increase in 
self-employment among the indigenous population than among other 
Australians. In 1986, the proportion of the indigenous Australians of 
working age who were self-employed was one-eighth of that of other 
Australians. 


Small business and self-employment are now regarded as important parts 
of the economy with specific government policies aimed at promoting 
these activities. The scope for self-employment differs between industries 
and occupations reflecting differences in the scale of production, the 
extent of public ownership and the technologies involved. Among the 
population in general, self-employment is important in farming activities, 
the professions (for example doctors, lawyers and accountants), retail 
trade and construction. The Department of Industry, Technology and 
Commerce (DITECH), the Department of Employment, Education and 
Training (DEET) and the Department of Primary Industry and Energy 
(DPIE) are some Commonwealth agencies running programs to promote 
small business. There is even a specific program, the Aboriginal 
Enterprise Incentive Scheme (AEIS) run initially by DEET, with the aim 
of assisting unemployed indigenous Australians to establish small 
businesses. In 1990 the scheme had a budget of $9 million. In July 1992, 
responsibility for AEIS, along with the community elements of the 


86 


Training for Aboriginals Program (TAP), was transferred to the 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) (see ATSIC 
1994 for a fuller discussion). 


A range of programs have also been run by ATSIC and its predecessors 
which aimed to promote indigenous enterprises. These programs have met 
with limited success and their role under the AEDP was reduced (for 
some critical reviews of programs see Jarvie 1990 and Office of 
Evaluation and Audit (OEA) 1990, 1991). However, following the 
recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in 
Custody, the Community Economic Initiatives Scheme has been 
established for the promotion of indigenous community enterprises. A 
$23 million budget will be administered by ATSIC and spent over a 
five-year period. In addition, ATSIC also administers the Business 
Funding Scheme for the establishment of commercially viable enterprises 
and subsidises employment in indigenous enterprises under the Enterprise 
Employment Assistance scheme (see ATSIC 1994 for fuller discussions 
of these programs although their success awaits detailed analysis). 


The emphasis of this chapter will be on a description of self-employed 
indigenous Australians as recorded in the 1991 Census and a comparison 
between this group and two others: indigenous Australians who were 
wage and salary earners and self-employed other Australians. Two 
comparison groups have been used as there are two broad questions for 
analysis here. The first relates to the indigenous population: how do 
self-employed indigenous Australians compare with indigenous Australian 
wage and salary earners? This will suggest whether there are any 
particular niches within the labour market which are more appropriate for 
self-employed indigenous Australians. 


The second question relates to how self-employed indigenous Australians 
compare with the self-employed in the rest of the population. Such a 
comparison can be used to suggest areas, occupations or industries, where 
self-employment of indigenous Australians could be expanded. 


This chapter also presents some brief comparisons of self-employed 
indigenous Australians in 1986 and 1991. The results show a relatively 
large increase in the number of indigenous self-employed people over this 
five-year period. The number of self-employed indigenous Australians 
grew by 100.2 per cent compared with a growth of 30.8 per cent for 
indigenous wage and salary earners and 15.0 per cent in the number of 
non-indigenous people in self-employment. 


Two census categories have been included in the definition of 
self-employed used here: those who said that in the main job held last 
week they were ‘conducting own business but not employing others’ and 
those who were ‘conducting own business and employing others’ 
(question 28 of the census). Both categories have been included in the 
definition of self-employment used here because the aim is to present a 
broad picture of the characteristics of all self-employed people. The scale 
of the business is not a particular focus of this analysis nor is the aim to 
consider a subsection of the group in greater detail as in some studies 
(for example, Evans 1989). Sixty-six per cent of the indigenous 
Australians describing themselves as self-employed in 1991 did not 
employ anyone in their business. 


| This differs somewhat from Taylor’s (1993*) estimated growth rate because of slight 
differences in the definitions used and the use here of sample data rather than the full 
census count. 


87 


The characteristics of Table 6.1 presents data on the age distribution of self-employed 
self-employed indigenous indigenous Australians compared with the other major components of the 
Australians indigenous labour force: the employed and unemployed (unpaid helpers 


have been omitted as they constitute a very small category); and other 
self-employed Australians. Indigenous wage and salary earners constituted 
the major part of the indigenous labour force, with the self-employed 
only accounting for 4 per cent of the total. This was about a quarter of 
the share of the self-employed among the rest of the Australian labour 
force.

The self-employed were more likely to be male than female but the gap 
between the sexes was less pronounced for indigenous Australians than 
among other Australians where the self-employed accounted for 17.7 per 
cent of the male labour force and 11.7 per cent of the female labour

force. Age also appears to be related to employment status. Self-employed 
indigenous Australians were, on average, older than wage and salary 
earners and were concentrated in the 30-44 year age group. This was also 
true for the non-indigenous self-employed who were mainly between the 
ages of 30 and 50 years. In the interests of conciseness, the tables which 
follow will concentrate on the self-employed as a whole and will not 
present age and sex breakdowns. 


The picture of self-employed indigenous Australians which is presented in 
the census suggests that this group was, in many respects, more like the 
rest of the Australian population than were indigenous Australians in 
general. Several reported characteristics support this statement. They were 
more likely to live in a major urban area than were indigenous wage and 
salary earners (37 per cent compared with 30.8 per cent) and were more 
likely to be legally married (64.7 per cent compared with 41.4 per cent). 
However, on neither of these indicators did the percentages reach those of 
the non-indigenous self-employed, 53.9 per cent of whom lived in a 
major urban area and 79.7 per cent of whom were legally married. 
Self-employed indigenous Australians were reported as having a high 
proficiency in English; 95 per cent either spoke English as their main 
language or claimed to speak English ‘very well’ compared with 89 per 
cent of indigenous wage and salary earners and 94 per cent of ‘the 
non-indigenous self-employed. 


Tables 6.2 to 6.4 relate to education. Table 6.2 compares age on leaving 
school for the three groups. Based on this measure of educational 
attainment, self-employed indigenous Australians had, on average, left 
school earlier than either indigenous wage and salary earners or 
self-employed non-indigenous Australians. While 21 per cent of 
self-employed indigenous people had left school at the age of 17 years or 
older, 26 per cent of indigenous wage and salary earners and 36 per cent 
self-employed non-indigenous people were in this category. The 
proportion who had never attended school was similar for both 
indigenous groups but much higher than for the self-employed 
non-indigenous groups.

Table 6.3 shows that self-employed indigenous Australians were 
substantially more likely to hold a qualification than were indigenous 
wage and salary earners. The ‘no qualifications’ category was 21 per cent 
higher for wage and salary earners compared with self-employed 
indigenous Australians. Twenty-six per cent of self-employed indigenous 
Australians held a certificate qualification, over twice the proportion 
among indigenous wage and salary earners and similar to the proportion 
in the non-indigenous self-employed population. In comparison with the 
self-employed non-indigenous population, a much smaller proportion of 
self-employed indigenous Australians held university degrees or diplomas: 
5.1 per cent compared with 14.5 per cent. This difference is reflected in 
the much larger percentage of the non-indigenous self-employed in the 
professions reported in the occupational distribution considered below 
(see Table 6.5). Self-employed indigenous Australians were less likely to 
hold a qualification than were other self-employed Australians.

important among other self-employed Australians.

Occupation and industry of employment data presented in Tables 6.5 and 
6.6 reflected the educational background of workers. The large group of 
self-employed indigenous Australians with certificate qualifications were 
occupied as tradespersons, mainly in the building and vehicle industries. 
The other large occupational group, apart from tradespersons, was 
managers and administrators. It is perhaps not surprising to find that 
about one-quarter of self-employed indigenous Australians were classified 
as managers and administrators compared with only 3.7 per cent of 
indigenous wage and salary earners (see Table 6.5). This, however, was a 
smaller proportion than the 32.4 per cent of the non-indigenous 
self-employed who were classified as managers and administrators. In this 
group the major occupations were farmers and farm managers. A smaller 
proportion of the indigenous self-employed were classified as 
professionals compared with both indigenous wage and salary earners and 
the non-indigenous self-employed. Most of the indigenous wage and 
salary earning professionals were business professionals, school teachers 
and social professionals while the largest group of self-employed 
indigenous professionals were in the ‘artists and related’ category.

The difference between self-employed indigenous and non-indigenous 
Australians was that non-indigenous Australians work in the more skilled 
occupations. This was offset at the other end of the skill spectrum: while 
13.4 per cent of the non-indigenous self-employed were in the less skilled 
occupations of plant and machinery operators and labourers, 24.2 per cent 
of the indigenous self-employed were in these groups. This compared 
with the 40 per cent of indigenous wage and salary earners who were in 
these groups. The major occupations in these categories for the 
self-employed were ‘road/rail transport drivers’, ‘miscellaneous labourers’ 
and ‘cleaners’. Further information would be necessary to establish what 
work self-employed ‘miscellaneous labourers’ were actually engaged in. 


The distribution of self-employed indigenous Australians across the 
twelve major industry groups differed markedly from the distribution of 
wage and salary earmers reflecting differences between industries in the 
technologies employed, the scale of production and the extent of public 
ownership (see Table 6.6). Over half of self-employed indigenous 
_Australians were working in agriculture, construction and the wholesale 
and retail trades. However, these three industries only accounted for 
20.1 per cent of wage and salary employment. Community services, 
which was the major employer of indigenous wage and salary earners 
(37 per cent of total employment) accounted for only 7.8 per cent of 
employment amongst self-employed indigenous Australians.

The industry distribution of employment of self-employed indigenous 
Australians was much closer to the distribution of other self-employed 
Australians (the correlation coefficient r = 0.95). Wholesale and retail 
trade, construction and agriculture were the main industries of 
employment for both self-employed groups. One notable difference, 
however, was the smaller proportion of self-employed indigenous 
Australians in the finance and property industry. 


When occupation of employment within an industry was also considered, 
there were some significant differences between self-employed indigenous 
Australians and others. The largest differences in occupational status 
within industries were in the service industries (particularly finance and 
community services) and in agriculture. In agriculture, 69 per cent of 
self-employed indigenous Australians were managers and administrators 
compared with 88 per cent of other self-employed Australians in this 
industry. This difference was offset by higher proportions of the 
indigenous self-employed in the tradesmen and labourers categories. In 
finance and community services the proportion of the non-indigenous 
self-employed who were classified as professionals was roughly double 
that of indigenous Australians. These differences were offset by a larger 
share of para-professionals, labourers and sales workers among the 
indigenous self-employed in these industries. In summary, while 
indigenous self-employed people were employed in similar proportions 
across the major industry groups to their counterparts in the rest of the 
Australian community, they tended to be employed in the less skilled 
occupations in these industries. 


93 


There were some interesting differences between the employment patterns 
of indigenous wage and salary earners and the self-employed across 
section-of-State categories (see Daly 1994” for a fuller discussion of these 
results). As already shown in Table 6.6, the community service industry 
was a larger employer of indigenous wage and salary earners than of the 
self-employed but this was particularly pronounced in the rural areas. 
Agriculture was the major industry of employment for self-employed 
indigenous Australians in these areas. In urban areas, wholesale and retail 
trades and construction were the major employers of self-employed 


indigenous Australians. In comparison with the non-indigenous 


self-employed, this group was relatively under-represented in wholesale 
and retail trades and in the finance industry in the major urban centres. 


In the interests of completeness, Table 6.7 presents the sector of 
employment for the indigenous self-employed and the two comparison 
groups. It is not surprising to see that self-employment was very much 
concentrated in the private sector with only 2.6 per cent of self-employed 
indigenous Australians in the government sector. This compared with the 
41 per cent of indigenous wage and salary earners who worked there. 
Government employment provided an even smaller share, less than 1 per 


cent, of employment for other self-employed Australians.

These differences between indigenous wage and salary earners and the 
self-employed might be expected to be reflected in income differences. 


Measurement of incomes of self-employed people, however, is 


particularly difficult because the separation of expenditure and income 
into current and investment components is complex. For example, a 
farmer may have a low annual disposable income because he has invested 
in farm improvements which will yield a capital gain on the sale of the 
farm at some point in the future. His current income therefore does not 
fully reflect his command over goods and services. Complications such as 
this make a comparison of income between wage and salary earners and 


the self-employed difficult.” 


2 Chiswick (1983) presents a methodology based on a human capital eamings function, for 
the decomposition of income for the self-employed into its labour and non-labour 


components. 


94 


The figures presented in Table 6.8 show that median annual income was 
almost identical for the two groups of indigenous Australians. Given the 
presumption that the income of self-employed indigenous Australians may 
be understated, these results show that this group is not worse off in 
terms of money income than other indigenous Australians. 


A comparison between the indigenous and non-indigenous self-employed 
is perhaps less problematic as the difficulty of distinguishing individual 
income from that of the business is present for both. The median income 
of self-employed indigenous Australians was 82 per cent of that for 
self-employed non-indigenous Australians. This is a higher ratio than for 
employed indigenous Australians compared with other employed 
Australians in general.

The changing 
characteristics of 
self-employed indigenous 
Australians, 1986-91 


Although remaining a small group within the indigenous population, there 
have been significant increases in the number of indigenous Australians 
recorded as self-employed in the census. This section will summarise 
some of the changes which have taken place between 1986 and 1991 

(see Daly 1994° for a fuller discussion of the changes). Data from the 
1986 Census which are used as a base for these comparisons, are reported 
more fully in Daly (1993°). 


The number of indigenous Australians reported to be self-employed in the 
census doubled between 1986 and 1991 to 3,232 people, a growth rate 
well in excess of the growth in self-employment among other Australians. 
Most of this growth in the number of indigenous self-employed took 
place among those who had left school relatively young, aged 

15-16 years, in contrast to the growth among the non-indigenous 
self-employed concentrated among those who had left school aged 

17 years and over. These differences in educational background were 
reflected in the major occupational growth areas. The largest growth for 
self employed indigenous Australians took place among managers and 
administrators and tradespersons while the growing occupational groups 
for the non-indigenous self-employed were professionals and salespersons. 
In terms of industry of employment, the major growth areas for 
self-employed indigenous Australians were wholesale and retail trade, 
community services and construction while finance and wholesale and 
retail trade accounted for most of the growth in employment for the 
non-indigenous self-employed. Finally, there is some evidence of a 
declining ratio of median indigenous self-employed income to that of

of the low level of 
self-employment among

other self-employed Australians: from 92 per cent in 1986 to 82 per cent 
in 1991. This perhaps reflects the more rapid growth of professional 
employment among other self-employed Australians than among 
indigenous Australians. 


The census data reported here show that for indigenous Australians, 
self-employment is a minor but growing activity. Most indigenous 
Australians in employment were wage and salary earners. There are, 
however, a number of reasons why these census statistics under-represent 
the extent of self-employment and entrepreneurial activity among 
indigenous Australians. 


Firstly, there is the problem that indigenous artists and hunter-gatherers 
may not classify themselves or be recognised as self-employed under 
existing definitions. The Aboriginal Arts and Crafts Review (Altman 
1989) estimated that there were 4,838 indigenous artists in Australia in 
1987-88, but the 1986 Census showed only 59 indigenous Australians 
engaged in visual arts and crafts occupations. In 1991, 82 indigenous 
Australians were recorded as self-employed ‘artists and related 
professionals’ and a further 345 as wage and salary earners. These figures 
remain well below the estimated number of indigenous artists. 


Similarly, hunter-gatherers are unlikely to be included among the 
self-employed as they could not be described as ‘conducting their own 
business’ even though they are working to produce non-monetary income 
for themselves. Altman and Taylor (1989) estimated that about 10 per 
cent of the indigenous population lived at outstations where some hunting 
and gathering activities were undertaken.’ The inclusion of these groups 
would increase the importance of self-employment among indigenous 
Australians. However, in order to compare this figure with that of the 
total Australian population, it would be necessary to make a similar 
adjustment for other Australians who earned income from similar 
sources.’ It seems likely that the proportion of indigenous Australians in 
a more broadly defined category of self-employment would remain below 
that of other Australians.° 


It is questionable, however, whether it is appropriate to think of these 
artists and hunter-gatherers as self-employed in the sense of being 
self-supporting and independent of government transfers. The majority. of 
the artists surveyed for the Arts and Crafts Review earned less than 
$1,000 a year from these activities; this income was usually a supplement 
to income derived from other sources. Similarly, hunting and gathering 
activities produced only part of the income of people living at outstations 
(Altman 1987°; Altman and Taylor 1989; Fisk 1985) as many adults 
received income transfers from government. The use of a broader 
definition of self-employment to include these groups would conceal 
important characteristics of the individuals concerned. For example, the 
income generated by most indigenous artists was not sufficient to make 
them economically independent; to describe them as self-employed would 
suggest otherwise. The need for income support from sources other than 
arts and crafts production and hunting and gathering would remain if 


3 See Altman and Allen (1992*) for a recent survey of studies of the contribution of 
subsistence activities to the income of indigenous Australians living in remote Australia. 

4 See Altman and Allen (1992) for a discussion of the issues relating to the inclusion of the 
informal sector in official statistics. 

>It has been suggested by a referee of an earlier version of this chapter that unemployed 
indigenous Australians in some communities may identify themselves as self-employed. If 
this is the case, indigenous self-employment may be overstated by the census data. Further 
research is required to quantify the importance of this factor. 


96 


incomes of indigenous Australians were not to fall even further behind 
those of other Australians. 


One of the reasons for low levels of self-employment among indigenous 
Australians may be the government agencies’ preference for funding of 
community enterprises rather than individual ones. Arthur (1992) and 
Young (1988) show that in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy 
there has been considerable emphasis placed on the community in the 
establishment of enterprises. This emphasis may in part explain or 
contribute to the low rate of self-employment among indigenous 
Australians. 


Other factors may also be important in explaining differential rates of 
self-employment and the low rate of success of indigenous community 
enterprises (see Altman 1987*, 1988; Office of Evaluation and Audit 
1991; Jarvie 1990; Arthur 1992; Young 1987, 1988 for fuller discussions 
of these issues). An obvious limiting factor is the lower level of 
education, labour market experience and management skills among 
indigenous Australians compared with the rest of the Australian 
population. For example, Young (1987) noted that indigenous enterprises 
such as the community store, were often run by European managers 
because there was no indigenous member of the community with the 
necessary commercial experience. Altman (1987*, 1988) also emphasised 
the lack of managerial skills as an inhibiting factor in the development of 
indigenous tourist enterprises. 


A further argument attributes these differences, in part, to an absence of a 
‘culture of entrepreneurship’ among indigenous Australians (Altman 1988; 
Young 1987, 1988). Young emphasises the importance of kinship ties and 
authority structures based on age and traditional knowledge as barriers to 
profit maximising behaviour in the management of commercial 
enterprises. Furthermore, in remote Australia, traditional owners of land 
may have particular rights of control over all enterprises conducted on 
this land regardless of their ability or experience in running enterprises 
(Ellana et al. 1988). 


Access to the necessary capital to establish an enterprise is another factor 
limiting the ability of poor indigenous Australians to establish their own 
businesses. Altman (1988) noted that even where there were significant 
amounts of capital available from royalty payments, there was a tension 
between spending the money now on needy members of the community 
or investing it for the future. 


A final explanation of the lack of entrepreneurial success among 
indigenous Australians is the relatively large proportion living in remote 
areas where transport costs and a low level of local demand inhibit the 
growth of small business. Although location of residence may reduce the 
scope for the establishment of a wide range of small businesses, it also 
creates Opportunities based on these locations. Altman (1989) estimated 
that half of the indigenous artists in Australia lived in the Northern 
Territory, where their location offers them opportunities for sale of their 
work to tourists. 


The relative importance of all of these factors in explaining the low levels 
of self-employment among indigenous Australians remains unquantified 
and census data are not conducive to a further investigation of these 
issues. 


Conclusion 


97 


The role of self-employment and small business in providing 
opportunities for disadvantaged groups to develop a niche in the labour 
market has been emphasised in a number of studies of the economic 
status of migrants in various countries. Many of the problems faced by 
migrants such as language difficulties and discrimination, may also exist 
for indigenous Australians entering the labour market, yet 
self-employment remains a minor, although growing, activity for 
indigenous Australians. According to 1991 Census figures, the indigenous 
working-age population had a self-employment rate which was one-fifth 
of that of the rest of the Australian population; 2.2 per cent compared 
with 11.1 per cent. There appear to be a number of possible explanations 
of this result. 


A first possibility is that there are a large number of indigenous 
Australians working as artists and hunter-gatherers who either do not 
classify themselves, or are not recognised, as self-employed. These people 
generate income from these activities and as such make an important 
contribution to their own wellbeing. It is, however, important to recognise 
that the majority of this group remain dependent on income transfers 
from government. While it would be misleading to describe this group as 
economically inactive or totally welfare dependent, it seems inappropriate 
to classify them as self-employed in the sense that they are economically 
independent of government income support. 


The emphasis of government funding on community enterprises may be 
another factor contributing to the lower rate of self-employment among 
indigenous Australians, especially in urban settings where there are no 
communities. Among the other reasons which have been put forward to 
explain the lack of entrepreneurial success among indigenous Australians 
is a lack of education and training in the organisation of viable 
commercial enterprises. Shortages of capital and the limited opportunities 
related to remote locations of residence may also contribute to low levels 
of self-employment. The role of traditional value systems which do not fit 
well with the efficient organisation of a viable commercial enterprise has 
also been emphasised. Some of these factors may have positive as well as 
negative aspects. Indigenous Australians living traditional lifestyles in 
remote locations may be considered to have unique opportunities for the 
development of small business. 


Two comparison groups have been used in this chapter to present a 
picture of self-employed indigenous Australians. The first was a 
comparison with indigenous wage and salary earners. The major 
differences between these two groups of employed indigenous Australians 
were in the occupation and industry of employment. Self-employed 
indigenous Australians were more likely to -be employed as tradespersons 
and to work in the private sector (agriculture, construction and wholesale 
and retail trade) than were indigenous wage and salary earners. They may 
therefore offer important opportunities for the expansion of employment 
of indigenous Australians in these industries and for a reduction of 
indigenous dependence on public sector employment and welfare. 


In comparison with other self-employed Australians, self-employed 
indigenous Australians had spent less time at school and were less likely 
to have a formal qualification. They were mainly employed in trade 
occupations and in the lower-skilled occupations of plant and machinery 
operators and labourers. Self-employed indigenous Australians were 
under-represented among managers and administrators and professionals 
compared with other self-employed Australians. Raising educational 


98 


attainment is likely to increase the number of indigenous Australians in 
these groups, although this is a long term process requiring not only 
human capital but physical capital inputs. 


Self-employment has been recognised as a means by which disadvantaged 
groups can raise their economic status. However, there are other ways of 
achieving this end. In the case of indigenous Australians, community 
enterprises may offer access to employment and income for this 
disadvantaged group in the way that self-employment has for some 
migrant groups. If this is so, the low levels of self-employment among 
indigenous Australians may not be a particular problem but rather reflect 
features of indigenous culture. An important difference between privately 
owned small business and indigenous community enterprises arises when 
community enterprises remain dependent on public money and political 
support for viability. The success of indigenous commercial enterprises, 
whether run by individuals or communities, will depend amongst other 
things, on the development of the appropriate management skills and 
rewards for those working in enterprises.

CHAPTER 7 


CONCLUSION 


The aim of this study has been to describe the position of indigenous 
Australians in the labour market, to consider some of the possible causes 
of their relatively poor labour market performance, and to describe in 
more detail, some components of the indigenous labour force. The data 
used in this exercise have been from the Census of Population and 
Housing, conducted every five years by the ABS. While other data 
sources provide a valuable source of information on indigenous people in 
particular locations and at particular times, the census is the only 
comprehensive source of information on indigenous people which enables 
comparisons with other Australians. Despite some of the problems 
associated with the use of census data such as the limited validity of 
some of the concepts when applied to indigenous people living a more 
traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle (Smith 1994), the census data provide 
a framework for comparing the position of indigenous Australians with 
that of other Australians on a range of standard social indicators. This is 
not to deny the importance of many features of indigenous life which are 
not covered by the census but to focus on a part of it where comparisons 
with other Australians are possible. 


This chapter begins by summarising the major results of the study before 
presenting a discussion of some of the implications of these findings. 


The census evidence presented here shows that in 1991, indigenous 
Australians were less likely to be employed and over twice as likely to 
be unemployed that other Australians. Almost half of indigenous adults 
aged 15 years and over were not in the labour force compared with 

37 per cent of the total Australian population. This difference was even 
more pronounced when the differences in the age structure of the two 
groups were taken into account. The indigenous population is, on average, 
younger than other Australians and among adults of working age, almost — 
half of indigenous people were not in the labour force compared with 

28 per cent of other Australians (Taylor 1993*). 


There were also significant differences between indigenous and other 
Australians in the types of employment activities. Indigenous people in 
employment were more likely to be wage and salary earners than to be 
self-employed. In 1991, the indigenous working-aged population had a 
self-employment rate which was one-fifth of that of other Australians. 
Those indigenous Australians in employment were more likely to be 
working in the less skilled occupations of plant and machinery operators 
and labourers than were other Australians. Forty per cent of the 
indigenous employed were working in these occupations compared with 
21 per cent of other employed Australians in 1991. There were also 
important differences in the range of industries in which indigenous 
Australians found employment. Forty-four per cent of the indigenous 
Australians in employment worked in two industries, public 
administration and community services which accounted for a smaller 
23 per cent of the employment of other Australians. It is not surprising, 
given this result, that the private sector accounted for a smaller share of 
indigenous than non-indigenous employment. 


100 


An important determinant of labour force status and occupation is 
educational attainment. In 1991, indigenous Australians were less likely to 
have stayed at schooi until the age of 17 years than were other 
Australians and they were less likely to hold a post-secondary 
qualification. While 21 per cent of adult indigenous Australians had 
stayed at school until the age of 17 years, 36 per cent of other Australian 
adults were in this category. Over 90 per cent of indigenous Australians 
held no post-secondary qualification. 


Chapters 2 and 3 test, in the context of a formal statistical model, the 
implications of lower educational attainment for the labour force status 
and income of indigenous Australians. These models can be used to 
estimate the effect of Aboriginality on labour force status, holding 
everything else constant. They therefore can address the question of 
whether the poor labour market outcomes for indigenous Australians can 
be attributed to a lack of standard characteristics valued in the labour 
market, for example education and labour market experience, or whether 
there are particular characteristics associated with Aboriginality which are 
an important source of different labour market outcomes for otherwise 
similar indigenous and non-indigenous individuals. These effects may 
arise because of differences on the demand-side of the labour market, for 
example discrimination against indigenous people or differences on the 
supply-side, for example indigenous people may be unwilling to leave a 
particular place in search of employment. 


The results of this analysis of the determinants of labour force status 
show significant differences between indigenous and non-indigenous 
Australians (see chapter 2). Aboriginality substantially reduced the 
probability of being in full or part-time employment and increased the 
probability of being unemployed or not in the labour force for both males 
and females, holding everything else constant. In other words, the poor 
labour market outcomes of indigenous Australians could not be attributed 
solely to their lack of standard characteristics such as education, although 
additional education increased the probability of employment for both 
indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. This result of the importance 
of Aboriginality in determining labour force outcomes could reflect either 
demand or supply-side preferences for employment of indigenous people. 


Another important result from this analysis was the effect of location of 
residence on the labour force status of indigenous Australians. While the 
labour force status of other Australians did not vary greatly according to 
where they lived, it had a substantial and perhaps surprising effect on the 
labour force status of indigenous Australians. Indigenous people were less 
likely to be unemployed and more likely to be working part-time if they 
lived in a rural rather than an urban area, a point which will be discussed 
further below in considering aspects of the CDEP scheme. 


While Aboriginality was a major determinant of labour force status, it 
was less important as a determinant of income for the select group in 
full-time employment (see chapter 3). The results presented here 
emphasise the importance of differences in endowments of education, 
labour force experience and other human capital attributes in explaining 
the lower average income of indigenous Australians in full-time 
employment compared with other Australians. Once again, location of 
residence had a greater effect on indigenous than non-indigenous incomes. 
Indigenous Australians living in a rural location had substantially lower 
incomes than their counterparts in urban areas or than other Australians in 
these locations. This difference may offer some indication of the 


101 


monetary value that indigenous people place on living in these locations 
rather than moving to more highly paid employment elsewhere. 


Many of the differences highlighted in the general discussion of 
indigenous labour force status were apparent for both the 15-24 year old 
age group (chapter 4) and those over 50 years of age (chapter 5). 
Indigenous Australians had lower levels of educational attainment than 
other Australians. They were less likely to be in employment and those 
who were, were in the lower skilled occupations and concentrated in 
public administration, community services and for the younger people, 
wholesale and retail trade. There are however, some interesting 
comparisons to be made between younger and older indigenous 
Australians which offer some indication of the changes which have taken 
place between the generations. 


Perhaps the most significant change, apparent also in the data on 
educational attainment presented in chapter 1, are the differences between 
young and older indigenous people in the amount of schooling received. 
Among those aged 65 years and over, 32 per cent had not attended 
school but this had fallen to 1 per cent among the 15-19 year olds. 
Forty-three per cent of those aged 65 years and over had left school 
before the age of 15 years compared with 10 per cent of the 15-19 year 
olds. This contrast shows a substantial improvement in the access of 
indigenous Australians to schooling. However, the lack of post-secondary 
qualifications remains. Ninety-five per cent of those aged 50 years and 
over had no post-secondary qualification compared with 90 per cent of 
20-24 year olds. 


A superficial comparison of the employment/population ratios does not 
suggest that these differences in educational attainment have been 
associated with higher employment for young compared with older 
indigenous people. Similar proportions of 15—24 year olds and 50-64 year 
olds were in employment and the unemployment rate was over twice as 
high among 15—24 year olds. These differences may reflect lifecycle 
effects, for example older people are more likely to be on pensions and 
considered outside the labour force than are young people, and 
unemployment is typically higher for the young new entrants to the 
labour market. A more systematic analysis of the data would be required 
to isolate the effect of educational differences on the outcomes. 


There were some differences in the occupational distribution of 
employment for young and older indigenous people. Almost half the 
50-64 year olds were employed in the two low-skilled categories of plant 
and machinery operators and labourers compared with 36 per cent of the 
15-24 year olds in employment. A larger proportion. of young people 
were in the occupations of salespersons, clerks and tradespersons but they 
were less likely to be employed as managers and administrators and 
professionals, perhaps reflecting the fact that they were at the beginning 
of working life. The lower share of labouring employment and the greater 
share of employment as clerks and salespersons was particularly marked 
for young compared to older females. 


Community services was the major industry of employment for both the 
15-24 year olds and the 50-64 year olds, although retail and wholesale 
trade was relatively more important for young workers and transport and 
storage for older workers. Employment in the government sector was 
more important for older than younger indigenous workers. In summary 
these comparisons show some evidence of generational changes, 


The 1971-91 change 


102 


particularly in educational attainment and the occupation of those in 
employment. 


The final component of the indigenous labour force which was described 
in detail in chapter 6 is the self-employed. This group is a small but 
growing part of the indigenous labour force, accounting for 2.2 per cent 
of the working-age population in 1991. They may provide an important 
basis for the expansion of employment opportunities for indigenous 
people outside the government-funded sector. In comparison with 
indigenous wage and salary earners, they were more likely to be 
employed as tradespersons and to work in the private sector (agriculture, 
construction and wholesale and retail trade). However, in comparison to 
the non-indigenous self employed, they were concentrated in the 
less-skilled occupations and were under-represented among managers and 
administrators and professionals. Rising educational attainment is likely to 
increase the number of indigenous Australians in these occupations 
although it can be expected to be a long- term process. 


The reason for the focus of attention on labour force status and the types 
of employment is the association between labour force status and money 
income. Employment is the major source of income for most Australians 
and without it, income from welfare provides a minimum standard of 
living below that of those in full-time employment. On all the indicators 
reported here, indigenous Australians fared less well than other 
Australians; they were less likely to be in employment and those who 
were employed were concentrated in less skilled jobs. These differences 
were reflected in incomes. In 1991, the median income of an indigenous 
person was 63 per cent of that of a non-indigenous Australian. The only 
groups where indigenous Australians fared relatively well were those 
where employment income was not important, for example those aged 
65 years and over and the 15-19 age group. These results illustrate once 
again, the proposition that poor labour force outcomes are associated with 
relatively low incomes. 


The summary of the earlier section focuses on the results derived from 
the 1991 Census and provides a snapshot of the position of indigenous 
Australians in that year, but chapter 1 used data from all the censuses 
since 1971 to consider the changes which have taken place over time in 
the position of indigenous Australians in the labour market. There have 
been some important changes over this period and the outcomes have 
been different for males and females. 


One significant development over this period is the rising level of 
educational attainment of indigenous Australians, although it remained 
below that of other Australians. In 1976, 14 per cent of indigenous adults 
had not attended school, but this fell to 5 per cent in 1991. There was 
also some increase in the proportion of indigenous people with 
post-secondary qualifications, but the share without these qualifications 
remained 32 per cent higher than among other Australians. Although the 
results show an improvement in the access of indigenous people to 
schooling, there has also been a substantial growth in education retention 
rates among the non-indigenous population and the evidence from the 
census does not suggest that the improvements for indigenous people 
have been sufficient to close the gap between them and other Australians. 


There were also some major changes in the labour force status of 
indigenous Australians. Between 1971 and 1986, the share of the adult 
indigenous population who were employed fell from 41 per cent to 


Some issues for discussion 


103 


31 per cent and there was a four-fold increase in the proportion of 
indigenous people who were unemployed. This trend was reversed 
between 1986 and 1991 with some increase in employment and decrease 
in unemployment. The outcomes were, however, quite different for males 
and females. There was a dramatic decline in the employment/population 
ratio for males over the 1971-86 period followed by some improvement 
between 1986 and 1991. In contrast, an increasing proportion of 
indigenous females were in employment in 1991 compared with 1971. 


For those indigenous people in employment, there have been some 
substantial changes in the types of work. The public sector played a 
increasing role in the employment of indigenous Australians. While the 
share of total Australian employment accounted for by government fell by 
9 per cent between 1976 and 1991, the share of indigenous people 
employed by government rose by 12 per cent. This change was also 
apparent in the industry of employment data. In 1971, over half the 
indigenous people in employment were working in agriculture and 
community services, but in 1991 agriculture had been replaced by public 
administration and wholesale and retail trade as the major employers of 
indigenous labour. It was only possible to consider occupational changes 
between 1986 and 1991 and there is some evidence of a shift of 
indigenous employment to more skilled occupations. 


These labour market changes and changes in the access of indigenous 
people to the social security system have had implications for indigenous 
incomes (see Altman and Sanders 1991 and Daly and Hawke 1994° for 
further discussion of these changes in social security arrangements). The 
decline in indigenous male employment resulted in a 29 per cent 
reduction in the real median income between 1976 and 1991. In contrast, 
rising female employment, and the incorporation of indigenous 
Australians in the welfare system have led to a 78 per cent increase in 
the real median income of indigenous females. 


The continuing economic disadvantage of indigenous Australians 
highlighted in these census data raise a number of issues for policy 
formulation. Some of these will be the focus of the following section. 


The two major components of the Commonwealth government’s policy 
toward indigenous Australians are the AEP and the AEDP. The aim of 
the AEP is to promote educational opportunities for indigenous 
Australians and the AEDP has the goals of raising indigenous 
employment and reducing indigenous welfare dependence. They have both 
been recently reviewed and options for change and improvement 
considered. Given the level of the disadvantage of indigenous Australians, 
any policies aimed at raising their economic status must be long term to 
be effective and require the co-operation of State and local governments. 
General economic conditions will also play an important role in the 
outcomes. 


One of the major instruments of the AEDP is the CDEP scheme which 
offers indigenous people the opportunity to work on a part-time basis for 
their social security entitlement in community-based projects. The results 
presented here suggest a number of implications of the operation of the 
CDEP scheme. 


The evidence reported here would support the hypothesis that government 
policies to create employment for indigenous people have had some effect 
(see also Taylor 1993*). Given the ABS definition of participation in the 


104 


CDEP scheme as employment, the expansion of the scheme under the 
AEDP has created a form of employment for indigenous people at a time 
when other Australians have been losing their jobs. This conclusion raises 
the issue of whether people working on a part-time basis for the 
equivalent of their social security entitlement should be included among 
the employed. In some communities, participants are only paid if they 
report for work and many of the jobs performed are- comparable to those 
undertaken by other employed Australians; for example, garbage 
collection, road maintenance, and assistance in schools and hospitals 

(see Smith 1994 for a description of activities undertaken under the Port 
Lincoln CDEP scheme). In other communities, there is no requirement to 
work, and the activities of these participants more closely correspond to 
those of other unemployed Australians. These two extremes illustrate the 
fact that it is not easy to classify activity under the CDEP scheme into 
the conventional labour force categories. A separate identifier for those 
participating in the CDEP scheme and other government labour market 
programs would be useful in data on labour force participation. 


A major goal of the AEP has been to improve the access of indigenous 
people to education. The rising level of education provides one 
mechanism by which indigenous incomes may be increased in the longer 
term, especially in locations where there is access to a mainstream labour 
market. Existing evidence based on cross-sectional data, shows that those 
with higher levels of education, on average, have a higher probability of 
being in employment and achieving a higher income. If these 
relationships are sustained in the future, the rising indigenous retention 
rates at educational institutions should have positive implications for both 
indigenous employment status and income levels. However, if relative 
levels of educational attainment are a critical determinant of employment 
status, not just the absolute level, raising the educational status of 
indigenous Australians may not be enough when educational status is 
rising among other Australians. If there is to be any catching up with the 
rest of the community, then indigenous Australians must increase their 
level of educational attainment even faster than that of other Australians. 


A further issue related to education and training is the relationship 
between the AEDP and the AEP. There is some danger of a conflict 
between the incentives offered under AEDP employment programs (eg the 
CDEP scheme) and the AEP programs to promote school retention. The 
offer of part-time employment within the community under the CDEP 
scheme may discourage individuals from pursuing further education. 
While not wishing to under-estimate the wider social benefits which may 
arise from this choice, it may have important implications for an 
individual’s future income potential and for the skill-base within a 
community. This example raises fundamental issues about the 
inter-relationship between the two policies. 


Levels of educational achievement also have implications for the range of 
employment opportunities available to indigenous people. The 
concentration of indigenous people in unskilled occupations is likely to 
have negative implications for the future of indigenous employment as 
these types of jobs become scarcer throughout the economy. The 
employment of indigenous people is also concentrated in particular 
industries where government funding is important. While this may, to 
some extent, protect indigenous people from cyclical changes in the state 
of the economy, it leaves them vulnerable to any major changes in 
government policy. The small but growing group of self-employed 
indigenous Australians could provide an important basis for the expansion 


105 


of indigenous employment opportunities outside the government-funded 
sector. 


The geographical distribution of indigenous Australians and the fact that 
it differs markedly from the distribution of other Australians is another 
important issue for policy. The results presented here show that location 
of residence has important effects on indigenous labour force status and 
income from employment which differ from the effects on other 
Australians. Living in remote and rural Australia may reduce employment 
opportunities for the third of indigenous people who live there. These 
locations, however, also have particular advantages, for example access to 
areas where subsistence from hunting and gathering is possible and the 
opportunity for tourist-related employment. Although it has proved 
difficult to foster mainstream employment opportunities for indigenous 
Australians in these areas, there are a range of possibilities which could 
usefully be developed (see for example Altman 1988). Evidence suggests 
that indigenous Australians are less likely to migrate to employment 
(Taylor 1991, Taylor 1992°) and that their migration patterns are far more 
localised than those of other Australians (Taylor and Bell 1994). These 
results suggest that the problems associated with the creation of 
employment in rural Australia will not disappear through migration out of 
these areas. 


One final issue for discussion is the different employment and income 
results for indigenous males and females. Over this period, indigenous 
females have fared much better than their male counterparts; employment 
and incomes have increased and there is some evidence of movement into 
more skilled occupations. In contrast, males have faced reduced 
employment and incomes and there is less evidence of a shift toward 
more skilled employment. It is therefore important when addressing the 
issue of indigenous economic status, that sex differences are recognised. 


This study has illustrated the use of census data in discussing the labour 
market position of indigenous Australians. While the census is limited in 
its range of information, for example by its focus on one time period and 
its household-basis, it provides a wealth of data on a range of issues. It 
has the additional advantage of enabling comparisons with other 
Australians. An additional source of more detailed information on the 
indigenous population will come from the results of the 1994 survey of 
indigenous Australians, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
Survey (NATSIS) conducted by the ABS. Census and survey data have 
much to offer to researchers in this area although it is important to 
remember that it is only one source of information on Australia’s 
indigenous population.
