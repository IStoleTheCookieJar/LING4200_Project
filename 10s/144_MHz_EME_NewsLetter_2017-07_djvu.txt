PA2CHR travelling Southern Italy 


Chris PA2CHR is well known as an avid DXer, having been QRV from quite a number of rare squares 
and DXCC entities such as Palestine, Monaco, Albania, Vatican State to name but a view. In recent 
years he took joy in bringing rare squares on the air: In 2016 for instance he was QRV from much 
wanted squares in EA6 land, both on meteor scatter and EME. All this was and is done with a — for 
EME - comparably modest setup: IC 7100, powerful SSPA amp and a 26 ele xpol antenna. 


18/PA2CHR in JM87AX: a portable QTH at last! 


Past May and June Chris 

travelled to Southern Italy. 

There is quite a number of 

- rare squares which many 

yo stations are looking forward 
“oe to work on EME. 


The project started off in 
JN81 after a long travel by car 
from the Netherlands to 
Southern Italy. When 
preparing for the trip to that 
square some weeks ago, Chris 
had selected four possible 
locations. One was in the 
North part, near the coast 
and three more in the South, 
in the mountain area. When 
he arrived at the first one it 
looked very good: easy access 
and a good take-off. From 250 
to 120 degrees azimuth free 
take off and _ in_ other 
directions a maximum of 4 to 
5 degrees.

Happy with this one, Chris went to a nearby camping place to stay for the night and relax on the 
following day. Thursday, the third day after arrival, was meant to be the first day of operation. So 
he got up early and went to build up the station. Unfortunately the road was closed then because 
of maintenance. Big trucks were unloading concrete, so no possibility to pass. 


Chris had to make a decision: travel about 300 km further South (5 hours of drive) to one of the 
three other locations or going back to the camping place where he had noticed a reasonable good 
place on the highest part of it. The best option was the camping place. With some luck he got 
permission to park on the highest point and operation could start within a few hours. The maximum 
current at this camping site was 6 Aso PA2CHR had to ask for two outlets, one only for the amp. But 
when testing the transceiver there was no output on the Bird meter. Chris tried some time with 
changing cables and connectors, but without result. Fortunately he had brought a second 
transceiver planned for 50 Mhz operation. It was easy to switch to this one for 144 MHz also, but he 
had to make a PTT connection for the PA (as on 6 m he works without PA). This all required time: 
soldering a PTT cable, re-routing the other cables, checking data from the laptop, etc. 


In such a situation the worst mistake you can make is working in a hurry and then destroying 


essential parts of which you have no spares. Eventually Chris succeeded and everything was finally 
working o.k. Around 1500 UTC he made the first QSOs on 2 m.

Being on a camping site quite close to fellow campers ham life is not always easy. When Chris started 
assembling his 6 m antenna there were some complaints that the antenna was too big and also 
above neigbouring areas so he better canceled this and stayed on 2 m. Moreover at one time there 
was a power blackout in the camping site which Chris easily could have rectified but the 
management insisted on calling a professional company. So hours of inactivity passed. At least wx 
was fine with about 30°C. Anyway, 2 m was very successful and until May 22"! 102 stations were 
worked via EME from JN81. 


Then Chris travelled further south to reach JM87 square. That one is mainly a wet square with only 
little parts of Italian mainland. It is very much wanted also within meteor scatter reach as it is 
blocked to North by high mountains. And it is particularly hard to find a good location - as Chris had 
expected. When planning in Google maps and street view as well as with altitude maps he had 
decided four possible locations to set up the station. When arriving in JM87 all of those where not 
good. Also the QTH used by DH7FB in June 2004 and DF2ZC in October 2005 was not good: there 
was no road anymore, rain and mud had destroyed it completely. 


Luckily Chris had contacted Frank IZ8DWF some weeks before his departure. With his help they 
found a reasonable good location ‘in his backyard’ about 100 m asl. A good location for EME, but 
meteor scatter to the North was still difficult. During the ARI EME contest on May 27" and 238 
I8/PA2CHR completed 136 QSOs. Then he packed everything back into the car and continued to 
JM79 square. 


Monday May 29* the late afternoon Chris arrived in JM79XN and started to build up the 2 m 
antenna. When he started meteor scatter activity the next morning it took only some ten minutes 
and a forester together with a local policeman arrived. They had a look at everything and told him 
it was no problem to operate radio but it was absolutely not allowed to use a generator because of 
the danger of wild fires. It did not help much they saw his six plastic jerry cans with spare petrol. 


Hence, Chris had to leave this 
location. A nearby camping place, 
which was planned as ‘spare QTH’ 
was closed, so it was rather hard 
operating from JM79 at all. He 
continued driving along the 
coastline and eventually found a 
small parking place for campers. It 
was not ready yet, no ‘sanitary- 
things’ but good enough to stay a 
few days. The owner permitted to 
park the car and put up the 2 m 
antenna. 103 QSOs were made via 
EME from there, sometimes with 
very strong signals because of ‘sea- 
gain’ during moon-set.

The final location of this trip was in JM89FG, on a hill in a winter sport area about 1900 m asl. It had 
a very nice view around and yet again a local amateur, IZ8JHD, had advised Chris to use this location.

He also dropped by bringing wine and water! The EME conditions during these days were very 
strange, however. This was maybe due to high MUF over Europe. Lots of EME signals rapidly 
changed from horizontal to vertical and back. Also the degradation was on the rise now. 78 stations 
were worked via EME though. The most remarkable experience these days however were two very 
nice Es openings; one to France and Spain and the other one to Russia. 


Indonesia QRV via Moon! 


The 144 MHz EME NewsLetter by DF2ZC 


All in all Chris is very happy having worked 
419 stations via EME in total. The only 
disappointment were the just nine stations 
from USA in the log. This came as a surprise. 
Presumably “square-hunting’ is not very 
popular in the States. 


Now Chris is busy with preparations for the 
upcoming big trip to Swaziland in October....

Bint YC2MDU_ has _ just 
started to work moon 
bounce. He is QRV from 
OI53KD, running about 100 
W out to 4 x 13 ele yagis 
(see left OYC2MDU). So far 
he has completed with 
nearly 20 stations. 
Currently he is busy trying 
to upgrade the station with 
a sspa anda Ina. If you have 
a spare Ina please contact 
him direct or DF2ZC for 
relaying.

Upcoming DXpeditions 


LB6GG/P QRV From KQS5OIG 

Hans will soon run portable EME on 144 MHz from KQ50 square. He has nearly completed 
assembling the station and plans for July 21° for his first activities. Hans will stay up in the North 
until November this year and he will be QRV when work schedule and moon conds permit. Rig is 
about 450 W into 2 x 2.4 wl DK7ZB. On the rx-side he uses a LNA with 0.5 dB nf. More info is on his 


dedicated website https://lb6gg.wordpress.com/ 


Gene KB7Q Making Another Rare Grid Available: DN56 

On July 26" Gene will be QRV from DN56CK near Harlowton, Montana. He will start this one day 
activity around 16Z and will stay the full moon pass — depending on activity and conds, of course. 
Gene will CQ on his usual frequency 144.138 MHz +/- QRM and KB7Q is always tx 1°. Gear is 2 x 9 
ele yagis, 800 watts, K3 w/ internal xverter, excellent pre-amp, 2 kW generator. Updates are on 
Gene’s blog http://kb7qgrid.blogspot.de 


More nice DXpeditions later this year and in 2018 

A lot of interesting DXpeditions to rare DXCCs and/or squares are in the pipe already: RI1F (KR80) in 
September, CN2R (IM63), T8EM (PJ77) and 3DAOMB (KG53) in October, DX7EME (PJ19) and V31EME 
(EK57) in November, 3Y0Z (JD15) in January and T46 (EL93) in April — plus maybe some surprise 
activities. More news when we get closer to the dates.
